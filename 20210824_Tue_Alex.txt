[00:00.000 --> 00:06.880]  Pfizer will pay $2.3 billion in civil and criminal fines.
[00:06.880 --> 00:13.720]  The criminal fine, nearly $1.2 billion, is the single largest fine in U.S. history.
[00:13.720 --> 00:18.200]  The U.S. government will also supervise Pfizer's behavior for the next five years.
[00:18.200 --> 00:24.880]  17-year-old Shamsu undergoes a DNA test to prove he's a victim of a failed drug trial
[00:24.880 --> 00:31.320]  by the pharmaceutical company Pfizer that happened 15 years ago in Carnot State, Nigeria.
[00:31.320 --> 00:37.240]  11 children were killed and several more injured when Pfizer tested out a drug called Troven
[00:37.240 --> 00:39.080]  on 200 children.
[00:39.080 --> 00:43.680]  The drug was supposed to treat a deadly regional outbreak of meningitis.
[00:43.680 --> 00:49.600]  Pfizer agreed to pay $75 million in compensation in 2009.
[00:49.600 --> 00:51.360]  Have you taken the vaccine, sir?
[00:51.360 --> 00:58.160]  No, I haven't taken it yet, and we are having an ethical committee dealing with the question
[00:58.160 --> 00:59.160]  of who is getting it.
[00:59.160 --> 01:04.040]  So they're going to plan on getting FDA approval for the COVID vaccine next week so they can
[01:04.040 --> 01:06.720]  try to push all these mandates on everybody because they're going to tell you how safe
[01:06.720 --> 01:07.720]  and effective it is.
[01:07.720 --> 01:09.360]  Well, guess how they did it?
[01:09.360 --> 01:14.320]  They got a woman named Janet Woodcock, who is the chief for the Center of Drug Evaluation
[01:14.320 --> 01:20.560]  Research, and they put her as the acting head of the FDA to give her the approval status.
[01:20.560 --> 01:26.480]  And this woman is personally responsible for approving both oxy-cotton, which is causing
[01:26.480 --> 01:32.760]  a frigging epidemic, and fentanyl, the two most dangerous drugs on the market today that
[01:32.760 --> 01:37.360]  got approved by this woman, Janet Woodcock, who's now going to be approving our COVID
[01:37.360 --> 01:40.760]  vaccines so they can push everybody with mandates.
[01:40.760 --> 01:46.720]  This would tip businesses and colleges to consider mandating the vaccine once it gets
[01:46.720 --> 01:47.720]  full approval.
[01:47.720 --> 01:49.120]  Would you urge them to do that?
[01:49.120 --> 01:51.720]  And I think it's a very reasonable thing to do.
[01:51.720 --> 01:59.280]  The FDA has now granted full approval of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, making it the first
[01:59.280 --> 02:05.720]  COVID vaccine to transition from emergency authorization status to full FDA approval.
[02:05.720 --> 02:07.280]  This is a game-changing moment.
[02:07.280 --> 02:11.460]  We've been waiting for this for a long time to have the full approval vaccine.
[02:11.460 --> 02:12.720]  We now have it.
[02:12.720 --> 02:17.840]  This helps us move forward, and we're moving forward with our schools with this new vaccine
[02:17.840 --> 02:18.840]  mandate.
[02:18.840 --> 02:25.000]  After a strict process, the FDA has reaffirmed its findings that the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine
[02:25.000 --> 02:31.440]  is safe and effective, and the FDA has given its full and final approval.
[02:31.440 --> 02:34.920]  So let me say this loudly and clearly.
[02:34.920 --> 02:41.280]  If you're one of the millions of Americans who've said that they will not get the shot
[02:41.280 --> 02:48.000]  when it's until it has full and final approval of the FDA, it has now happened.
[02:48.000 --> 02:50.280]  The moment you've been waiting for is here.
[02:50.280 --> 02:55.200]  It's time for you to go get your vaccination and get it today.
[02:55.200 --> 03:00.560]  Today I'm calling on more country, more companies, I should say, in the private sector, to step
[03:00.560 --> 03:05.080]  up with vaccine requirements that will reach millions more people.
[03:05.080 --> 03:11.800]  If you're a business leader, a nonprofit leader, a state or local leader who has been waiting
[03:11.800 --> 03:18.440]  for full FDA approval to require vaccinations, I'm calling you now to do that, require it.
[03:18.440 --> 03:24.000]  Do what I did last month, require your employees to get vaccinated or face strict requirements.
[03:24.000 --> 03:26.680]  This is right out of the federal government's own numbers.
[03:26.680 --> 03:28.280]  Daily report trends.
[03:28.280 --> 03:29.280]  Romanian.
[03:29.280 --> 03:31.800]  How do we explain this situation in Romania?
[03:31.800 --> 03:37.880]  25% of the population vaccinated, cases and deaths plummeting to basically zero, or the
[03:37.880 --> 03:38.880]  lowest in the world.
[03:38.880 --> 03:39.880]  Take a look at Australia.
[03:39.880 --> 03:43.480]  They've got 20-something percent taking the vaccine.
[03:43.480 --> 03:46.720]  No one is in the hospital now that is unvaccinated.
[03:46.720 --> 03:54.120]  Now, what's happening in the most vaccinated state in the United States?
[03:54.120 --> 04:00.040]  Current hospitalizations, Hawaii, you can see the mask mandate and the inoculations
[04:00.040 --> 04:02.560]  all starting right here.
[04:02.560 --> 04:07.080]  And what happens right when they start the shots?
[04:07.080 --> 04:10.560]  It's a spike, but it takes a while for the mutations to grow and to get out into the
[04:10.560 --> 04:16.080]  population and then suddenly look at that spike.
[04:16.080 --> 04:20.080]  Cross the border!
[04:20.080 --> 04:27.520]  Everyone cross the border, they can't hold all of us.
[04:27.520 --> 04:33.160]  We're talking millions in France, millions in Australia, overrunning the police, overrunning
[04:33.160 --> 04:38.720]  the shopping malls, the grocery stores, saying no to the COVID checkpoints, saying they know
[04:38.720 --> 04:45.480]  it's the great reset, that they're chanting jail, Fauci, jail, swab, all over the world.
[04:45.480 --> 05:00.320]  Because they are bringing in an authoritarian regime and building death camps.
[05:00.320 --> 05:07.640]  The first time I heard the speech, the first time I read the writings of Teddy Roosevelt,
[05:07.640 --> 05:13.320]  I was in sixth grade and we had this history teacher that had us write a paper on the man
[05:13.320 --> 05:14.320]  in the arena.
[05:14.320 --> 05:18.040]  And I just remember thinking about that saying, I want to be the man in the arena.
[05:18.040 --> 05:21.960]  Well, when it comes to media, infowars has been the tip of that spear.
[05:21.960 --> 05:27.400]  But Mike Lindell has come along and done just as good a job as we've done, maybe even better
[05:27.400 --> 05:30.160]  when it comes to election fraud and other issues.
[05:30.160 --> 05:36.360]  And that's why if you go to mypillow.com and use promo code Alex, you get up to 66% off
[05:36.360 --> 05:37.920]  on all of the amazing products.
[05:37.920 --> 05:41.160]  He's got so many, not just pillows, not just towels, not just sheets.
[05:41.160 --> 05:46.040]  And then you fund infowars and Mike Lindell in the fight for free speech against the globalist.
[05:46.040 --> 05:50.320]  There's not a better place to spend your money than mypillow.com with promo code Alex.
[05:50.320 --> 05:54.840]  And if you do it, it funds the info war, it funds the election investigation, and it stands
[05:54.840 --> 05:56.400]  up against these globalist bullies.
[05:56.400 --> 06:21.800]  Mypillow.com, promo code Alex, take action now.
[06:26.400 --> 06:42.760]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[06:42.760 --> 06:45.920]  Despite all the censorship and all the attacks, thanks to our incredible lesters across the
[06:45.920 --> 06:52.240]  planet that erased color and cream, bleed red blood and love liberty, we are still number
[06:52.240 --> 06:56.200]  one transmitting the truth of a planetary scale.
[06:56.200 --> 06:59.880]  This Tuesday, August 24th, the year is 2021.
[06:59.880 --> 07:11.400]  We are now inside the vaunted New World Order, and it's just going to get a lot crazier from
[07:11.400 --> 07:13.200]  here on out.
[07:13.200 --> 07:16.200]  Okay, you're going to see the best of people.
[07:16.200 --> 07:18.600]  We're going to see the worst of people now.
[07:18.600 --> 07:25.240]  There is incredibly beautiful opposition to the clear tyranny of 1984 proportions that
[07:25.240 --> 07:29.520]  is taking place across the world, and you're going to find out who's for slavery and who
[07:29.520 --> 07:30.520]  isn't.
[07:30.520 --> 07:32.520]  Now, I don't lionize Bill Maher.
[07:32.520 --> 07:34.720]  I've been a big enemy of Bill Maher.
[07:34.720 --> 07:35.720]  We had listeners takeover.
[07:35.720 --> 07:37.720]  I mean, I didn't do it.
[07:37.720 --> 07:40.640]  I didn't order him to do it, but he blamed me, so I took the blame.
[07:40.640 --> 07:42.840]  I mean, I said, yeah, I support it.
[07:42.840 --> 07:46.920]  Takeover his live studio audience a couple times, exposing Building 7 and the fact that
[07:46.920 --> 07:49.480]  it was blown up.
[07:49.480 --> 07:53.640]  But when he gets things right and comes out and says, don't block ivermectin, don't censor
[07:53.640 --> 07:59.240]  the Internet, don't censor Alex Jones, Alex Jones gets to speak, when he comes out and
[07:59.240 --> 08:04.360]  says, Google lied to us about the Wuhan lab and shouldn't be censoring, when he comes
[08:04.360 --> 08:10.600]  out and says, look, I took the vaccine, it's not a vaccine, and then I got COVID really
[08:10.600 --> 08:12.120]  bad after I took it.
[08:12.120 --> 08:13.360]  He knows he got sick from it.
[08:13.360 --> 08:16.120]  And quite frankly, Maher looks 10 years older since he took it.
[08:16.120 --> 08:20.080]  When I put him down, it's just true, and I think he pissed off about it, just like all
[08:20.080 --> 08:21.720]  these other people that have taken it.
[08:21.720 --> 08:26.560]  How many prominent people have taken it because they wanted to get the economy back going?
[08:26.560 --> 08:31.400]  They believe the carrot argument that if you do this, you'll get the carrot of things go
[08:31.400 --> 08:32.400]  back to normal.
[08:32.400 --> 08:36.760]  But now that we see that, oh, the vaccine doesn't work, and there's all these new boosters,
[08:36.760 --> 08:39.400]  he comes out and says, screw this.
[08:39.400 --> 08:41.080]  I don't want, I mean, how many shots?
[08:41.080 --> 08:46.640]  He understands he's becoming a captive of big pharma and this transcends left and right.
[08:46.640 --> 08:50.040]  It's just like, pull it out of the yesterday's stack.
[08:50.040 --> 08:51.040]  I forgot to cover it.
[08:51.040 --> 08:53.040]  There's a whole stack on it.
[08:53.040 --> 08:56.520]  90 major organizations is the headline.
[08:56.520 --> 09:01.920]  Ask Apple to stop saying they're going to scan everything on your phone every few milliseconds
[09:01.920 --> 09:05.920]  and read what you write and text and scan your photos to make sure you're not a pedophile
[09:05.920 --> 09:06.920]  or a criminal.
[09:06.920 --> 09:08.920]  And Bill Maher said the same thing last week.
[09:08.920 --> 09:10.920]  He said, he has great analogies.
[09:10.920 --> 09:12.160]  I mean, I'd love to get him on our side.
[09:12.160 --> 09:13.160]  He's super smart.
[09:13.160 --> 09:16.160]  He said, I'd be like buying a safe for your house.
[09:16.160 --> 09:20.120]  And they go, oh, we're going to drop by sometimes and just make sure there's not child born in
[09:20.120 --> 09:21.120]  it.
[09:21.120 --> 09:22.120]  What the hell does that mean?
[09:22.120 --> 09:23.120]  What does that mean?
[09:23.120 --> 09:27.840]  You got your passport, you got guns in there, you got insurance policies and stuff.
[09:27.840 --> 09:29.960]  Oh, well, we need to look.
[09:29.960 --> 09:33.400]  We need to see what's in there.
[09:33.400 --> 09:34.680]  This is the creed of slaves.
[09:34.680 --> 09:40.200]  I mean, another analogy would be all houses must be made out of glass and you must keep
[09:40.200 --> 09:44.960]  your lights on all night long in case you try something in the dark.
[09:44.960 --> 09:48.320]  I mean, do not look at the sun.
[09:48.320 --> 09:49.560]  Do not leave your house.
[09:49.560 --> 09:51.280]  Do not talk to your neighbors.
[09:51.280 --> 09:53.720]  Do not look them in the eye.
[09:53.720 --> 09:57.680]  That's being said in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Spain.
[09:57.680 --> 10:05.840]  You're like, well, that sounds like Jim Jones to the order of 100.
[10:05.840 --> 10:12.720]  And yeah, that's real cult programming because the globalists want you to do something that
[10:12.720 --> 10:18.280]  doesn't make sense and destroys you.
[10:18.280 --> 10:27.240]  So we have got this insane things going on, Brett Favre, famous NFL quarterback.
[10:27.240 --> 10:33.400]  They snuck it in on CNN when he was talking about concussions that, hey, these port the
[10:33.400 --> 10:38.080]  vaccines and basically said, no, so now they're all freaking out about that.
[10:38.080 --> 10:40.400]  I mean, people do their own research.
[10:40.400 --> 10:48.120]  They're not stupid, especially at that level of competition and the studies are out.
[10:48.120 --> 10:53.880]  The more educated you are, the higher your income, the more you don't want these shots
[10:53.880 --> 10:59.880]  because you go read that they've got liability protection, that all the top scientists are
[10:59.880 --> 11:03.520]  warning it's going to hurt you, that they did secret animal trials trying to get this
[11:03.520 --> 11:05.680]  approved before and it killed most of the animals.
[11:05.680 --> 11:10.600]  And now there's all this carnage and they still just want to stampede us into this.
[11:10.600 --> 11:12.040]  It's insane.
[11:12.040 --> 11:15.280]  So now they've got, let's just play it back to back.
[11:15.280 --> 11:18.280]  Here's Bill Maher, then we'll play Brett Favre.
[11:18.280 --> 11:22.720]  Because like now they want us to do all these boosters we were talking about with Andrew.
[11:22.720 --> 11:24.280]  I mean, I don't want a booster.
[11:24.280 --> 11:25.960]  Look, I never wanted the vaccine.
[11:25.960 --> 11:28.560]  I took one for the team.
[11:28.560 --> 11:31.760]  And by the way, you know who doesn't get a lot of vaccines?
[11:31.760 --> 11:32.760]  The millennials.
[11:32.760 --> 11:35.240]  I know a lot of millennials, especially the 2020 olds.
[11:35.240 --> 11:36.240]  They don't want it.
[11:36.240 --> 11:37.240]  They don't want it.
[11:37.240 --> 11:38.240]  They don't think they need it.
[11:38.240 --> 11:39.240]  They're probably right.
[11:39.240 --> 11:40.560]  But I tell them, I didn't want it either.
[11:40.560 --> 11:43.320]  I took one for the team.
[11:43.320 --> 11:47.760]  But every eight months, you're going to put this shit in me?
[11:47.760 --> 11:49.040]  I don't know about that.
[11:49.040 --> 11:50.120]  Maybe I don't need one.
[11:50.120 --> 11:52.880]  I don't want a one size fits all.
[11:52.880 --> 11:55.160]  My body may be different than your body.
[11:55.160 --> 11:57.200]  Yeah, I lost you, man.
[11:57.200 --> 11:58.200]  That's crazy.
[11:58.200 --> 11:59.200]  Look.
[11:59.200 --> 12:00.520]  My body isn't different.
[12:00.520 --> 12:01.880]  Everybody's body isn't somewhat different.
[12:01.880 --> 12:04.800]  I just read the statistics about who dies for this.
[12:04.800 --> 12:05.800]  You're trying to be cute.
[12:05.800 --> 12:06.800]  You're rolling the dice.
[12:06.800 --> 12:07.800]  I'm not trying to be cute.
[12:07.800 --> 12:08.800]  I know I'm in your house.
[12:08.800 --> 12:13.280]  I don't want to step over the line here, but genuinely, genuinely.
[12:13.280 --> 12:19.800]  People's lives are on the line, and just as significantly, our very way of life is on
[12:19.800 --> 12:20.800]  the line here.
[12:20.800 --> 12:21.800]  It's very important.
[12:21.800 --> 12:22.800]  All right, pause.
[12:22.800 --> 12:23.800]  We'll get vaccinated.
[12:23.800 --> 12:27.560]  He's going to yell at him in a minute, but look at this Democrat slime ball, no at all,
[12:27.560 --> 12:29.280]  who says, oh, are you crazy?
[12:29.280 --> 12:30.280]  Are you serious?
[12:30.280 --> 12:31.800]  That's his intellectual argument.
[12:31.800 --> 12:36.440]  Hey, your buddy Fauci cooked it up at the lab with Bill Gates and the chai comms.
[12:36.440 --> 12:39.200]  They released it.
[12:39.200 --> 12:40.880]  They didn't suppress treatments for it.
[12:40.880 --> 12:45.560]  They're signed on to a pack of murderers that own the patents on all these poison injections
[12:45.560 --> 12:46.960]  they're bringing out right now.
[12:46.960 --> 12:50.400]  Let's not forget who's behind this whole thing.
[12:50.400 --> 12:53.360]  Let's not forget that these shots lower your immunity, where you're going to have them
[12:53.360 --> 12:58.960]  for the rest of your life all the time, and this is a trap, and Bill Maher gets that.
[12:58.960 --> 13:03.640]  Why would people as a general society, even in the establishment, want to create a hell?
[13:03.640 --> 13:09.640]  That destroys everybody, but these guys want to follow the corporate directives of psychotic
[13:09.640 --> 13:15.920]  big pharma when Pfizer has more convictions and more giant settlements for knowingly killing
[13:15.920 --> 13:19.680]  people in secret trials around the world in the third world that any other company could
[13:19.680 --> 13:20.680]  bind.
[13:20.680 --> 13:21.680]  They're worse than Bayer.
[13:21.680 --> 13:24.160]  That no only gave millions a Javi an hepatitis.
[13:24.160 --> 13:28.040]  You think this is a fricking joke, your little smart mouth, punk, reading your corporate
[13:28.040 --> 13:32.400]  lines, trying to gaslight us, you little bastard?
[13:32.400 --> 13:34.920]  That is the club.
[13:34.920 --> 13:45.040]  Absolutely, but if there's a need for boosters, particularly as the evidence is showing amongst
[13:45.040 --> 13:50.480]  those who have underlying conditions, amongst the elderly, so on and so forth, it's important
[13:50.480 --> 13:53.760]  that they take them and it's important that they trust those who are urging them to do
[13:53.760 --> 13:54.760]  it.
[13:54.760 --> 13:56.760]  Okay, but you just said underlying conditions and elderly.
[13:56.760 --> 13:58.960]  I don't count myself either.
[13:58.960 --> 13:59.960]  So is my body...
[13:59.960 --> 14:00.960]  Bill, stop it.
[14:00.960 --> 14:05.000]  Oh, the guy said so on and so forth, wow, that's really intellectual.
[14:05.000 --> 14:07.520]  Notice he also said, our way of life is threatened.
[14:07.520 --> 14:09.920]  Oh, you're holding us hostage.
[14:09.920 --> 14:13.960]  Where Australia, the government admits, oh, we're following the UN recommendations to
[14:13.960 --> 14:19.080]  keep the lockdowns going until you all accept the shots.
[14:19.080 --> 14:23.520]  So you're holding us hostage and then saying, oh, those of you that don't take the shots,
[14:23.520 --> 14:28.000]  you're the reason two-year-olds got to wear a mask when it does nothing.
[14:28.000 --> 14:30.680]  People are damn cult leaders and we see through you.
[14:30.680 --> 14:32.880]  You need to be in frickin' prison.
[14:32.880 --> 14:37.840]  You people cooked it up, you released it and you need to be held and you need to be charged
[14:37.840 --> 14:42.840]  and you need to be tried and you need to have your nuts broken.
[14:42.840 --> 14:47.000]  After you've been convicted legally in a court of law, go back to them.
[14:47.000 --> 14:49.040]  Could I have some medical autonomy?
[14:49.040 --> 14:55.840]  No, look, you absolutely, no one is mandating it for you in your particular position, although
[14:55.840 --> 14:57.960]  they might, but I do think that...
[14:57.960 --> 14:58.960]  Stop it, hit pause.
[14:58.960 --> 14:59.960]  We got to go to break.
[14:59.960 --> 15:03.440]  I'm going to come back and just play this whole thing and listen to the double thing.
[15:03.440 --> 15:05.760]  No one's mandating it for you at this time.
[15:05.760 --> 15:06.760]  Maybe they will.
[15:06.760 --> 15:07.760]  It's all being pushed.
[15:07.760 --> 15:08.760]  It's all being bullied.
[15:08.760 --> 15:11.800]  It all violates the Nuremberg Code.
[15:11.800 --> 15:16.560]  And they've got these corporate shills just rattling off BS at us when everything they
[15:16.560 --> 15:17.560]  told us is a lie.
[15:17.560 --> 15:19.200]  In fact, find it during the break if you can.
[15:19.200 --> 15:21.360]  I'll play like three times last week.
[15:21.360 --> 15:28.800]  The surgeon general in his little admiral outfit, you know, it was weird whenever they
[15:28.800 --> 15:30.120]  had a Scientology did it.
[15:30.120 --> 15:32.040]  It's just as weird when this guy does it.
[15:32.040 --> 15:37.080]  He's up there in this admiral outfit and he says, oh, natural immunity doesn't work.
[15:37.080 --> 15:38.080]  It's no good.
[15:38.080 --> 15:39.080]  It doesn't exist.
[15:39.080 --> 15:43.480]  That's a total lie when it's 20, 30, 40 times better than this crap.
[15:43.480 --> 15:45.320]  Even if it was good, it's not.
[15:45.320 --> 15:50.080]  They're just lying to you like fire is not hot, fish do not live in the water.
[15:50.080 --> 15:52.160]  George Washington was not the president of the United States.
[15:52.160 --> 15:59.320]  I mean, just lie after lie after lie, beady-eyed scum lying to us.
[15:59.320 --> 16:03.160]  If you're concerned about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of off-grid
[16:03.160 --> 16:07.840]  electricity, this will be the most important message you'll hear this year.
[16:07.840 --> 16:08.840]  Here's why.
[16:08.840 --> 16:12.800]  We now have a small number of solar generators back in stock.
[16:12.800 --> 16:17.840]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving backup power when you need it most.
[16:17.840 --> 16:23.400]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly, emit no dangerous fumes and produce
[16:23.400 --> 16:26.880]  an endless supply of free electricity from the sun.
[16:26.880 --> 16:30.800]  Whether it's wildfires, dangerous weather, power grid issues, or just getting off the
[16:30.800 --> 16:35.520]  grid, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[16:35.520 --> 16:40.840]  Even better, all this week, radio listeners get over $700 in free off-the-grid bonuses
[16:40.840 --> 16:41.840]  too.
[16:41.840 --> 16:45.480]  Go to MySolarBackup.com to learn more and check availability.
[16:45.480 --> 16:47.440]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[16:47.440 --> 16:52.040]  Look for the free report, Crisis Cooling, how to make absolutely sure your meat, milk,
[16:52.040 --> 16:55.920]  and medicines stay safe and cool in any power outage.
[16:55.920 --> 16:57.920]  Yours free at MySolarBackup.com.
[16:57.920 --> 16:59.600]  Hey, everybody.
[16:59.600 --> 17:04.560]  If you've ever thought about heirloom beans as a storable survival food, I've got great
[17:04.560 --> 17:05.560]  news.
[17:05.560 --> 17:07.600]  In fact, I'll bet it's the best news you've heard in a while.
[17:07.600 --> 17:08.600]  Here's the thing.
[17:08.600 --> 17:14.160]  We've just received a fresh batch of gourmet heirloom beans, survival soup beans.
[17:14.160 --> 17:19.400]  These beans are gorgeous, highly nutritious, and above all, with no hesitation whatsoever,
[17:19.400 --> 17:22.200]  the best tasting beans in the entire world.
[17:22.200 --> 17:23.360]  The best part?
[17:23.360 --> 17:28.320]  We've dropped the price by 33 percent this week for listeners who know higher food prices
[17:28.320 --> 17:32.720]  are coming and want an inflation hedge you can actually eat if you want to.
[17:32.720 --> 17:33.720]  Gets even better.
[17:33.720 --> 17:38.400]  With your permission and with a high regard for your health and well-being, I also want
[17:38.400 --> 17:43.640]  to send you two pounds of what we think is the single most underrated superfood in the
[17:43.640 --> 17:44.640]  world.
[17:44.640 --> 17:45.640]  Period.
[17:45.640 --> 17:51.080]  Go to soupbeansurvival.com, that's soupbeansurvival.com, and discover the real reason we're giving
[17:51.080 --> 17:57.280]  this unusual superfood away at soupbeansurvival.com, that's soupbeansurvival.com.
[17:57.280 --> 18:05.280]  So, when I first started taking survival skills, basically I was 275 pounds overweight.
[18:05.280 --> 18:07.680]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe.
[18:07.680 --> 18:12.120]  I was barely holding on to a job, and I heard Dr. Group on your show, and I listened to
[18:12.120 --> 18:13.120]  it.
[18:13.120 --> 18:16.800]  It was the original survival shield, the X1, and it worked pretty good.
[18:16.800 --> 18:20.120]  And then shortly thereafter, you came out with that stew, you know, with a deep burn
[18:20.120 --> 18:22.800]  source, you know, and I got really excited about that, so I took it.
[18:22.800 --> 18:29.160]  And man, in two weeks, I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened.
[18:29.160 --> 18:33.880]  You know, I could think again, I could connect with people again, and over the course of
[18:33.880 --> 18:37.880]  the next couple of years, I got my health back, and I religiously take basically all
[18:37.880 --> 18:38.880]  of your supplements.
[18:38.880 --> 18:40.880]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[18:40.880 --> 18:45.320]  The one I like recently is knockout, literally, like if you want to sleep, just take it.
[18:45.320 --> 18:46.320]  It's amazing.
[18:46.320 --> 18:47.320]  It works.
[18:47.320 --> 18:50.440]  But anyway, so the point is, we have to get ourselves clean, we have to break free of
[18:50.440 --> 18:54.440]  the globalist system, and the only way to do that is to take our own health into our
[18:54.440 --> 18:55.440]  own hands.
[18:55.440 --> 18:56.440]  Beautifully said, brother.
[18:56.440 --> 19:00.440]  I thank you so much for your call and Godspeed.
[19:00.440 --> 19:05.440]  Jacob in Ohio, welcome, go ahead.
[19:05.440 --> 19:06.840]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[19:06.840 --> 19:07.840]  Good, bro.
[19:07.840 --> 19:08.840]  Great last caller.
[19:08.840 --> 19:11.080]  It's a pleasure to start with plugging your sleep supplement.
[19:11.080 --> 19:16.200]  It's basically the only way I get sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, the moralization,
[19:16.200 --> 19:17.200]  and absurdity.
[19:17.200 --> 19:19.360]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone, and...
[19:19.360 --> 19:21.000]  All right, Eric in New Hampshire.
[19:21.000 --> 19:22.000]  Eric, thanks for calling.
[19:22.000 --> 19:23.000]  Go ahead.
[19:23.000 --> 19:24.000]  Hey, Alex.
[19:24.000 --> 19:25.000]  Thanks for taking my call.
[19:25.000 --> 19:27.000]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for one of the product.
[19:27.000 --> 19:28.560]  The X2 does wonders.
[19:28.560 --> 19:31.000]  I recommend it to everybody here on the fence about it.
[19:31.000 --> 19:33.840]  Get off the fence, get the product, support the info war.
[19:33.840 --> 19:35.840]  Tyler in Maine, you're on the year.
[19:35.840 --> 19:36.840]  Thanks for holding.
[19:36.840 --> 19:37.840]  Go ahead.
[19:37.840 --> 19:38.840]  Thanks for having me on with you.
[19:38.840 --> 19:39.840]  It's an honor.
[19:39.840 --> 19:40.840]  Honored talk to you.
[19:40.840 --> 19:41.840]  Awesome.
[19:41.840 --> 19:46.840]  So, first thing I wanted to do was say I love the product, Alpha Power, even at 29.
[19:46.840 --> 19:50.840]  If you ask my better half, she loves it, and it helps in the bedroom.
[19:50.840 --> 19:52.840]  So, just number one for a few of you.
[19:52.840 --> 19:53.840]  It definitely works.
[19:53.840 --> 19:54.840]  It's not a joke.
[19:54.840 --> 20:21.480]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:21.480 --> 20:27.800]  So they're lying to you in the most bald-faced insane lies they can everywhere, in every
[20:27.800 --> 20:28.800]  way.
[20:28.800 --> 20:32.160]  But the people of the world are waking up and resisting.
[20:32.160 --> 20:33.800]  Next segment, I'll cover it.
[20:33.800 --> 20:39.440]  All over the planet in the UK, they're taking over TV stations in France, millions are marching,
[20:39.440 --> 20:44.120]  taking over whole cities, taking over shopping malls, absolutely dominating.
[20:44.120 --> 20:48.320]  In Australia, they're just breaking free and refusing to submit.
[20:48.320 --> 20:52.600]  And now, the prime minister is saying, okay, now we have to end the lockdowns because of
[20:52.600 --> 20:53.600]  the rebellion.
[20:53.600 --> 20:56.880]  Now, as soon as people stop rebelling, they'll bring the lockdowns right back.
[20:56.880 --> 21:01.600]  But people have to understand that this is the great reset.
[21:01.600 --> 21:02.800]  This is a takeover plan.
[21:02.800 --> 21:03.800]  Here's another one.
[21:03.800 --> 21:09.600]  Australia truck drivers vow to block every major highway in radical anti-lockdown strikes.
[21:09.600 --> 21:10.600]  Zero hedge.
[21:10.600 --> 21:16.000]  We'll be covering that coming up next segment, because they're coming for our children.
[21:16.000 --> 21:21.120]  Australia is the model, as Tucker Carlson did an excellent job last night, covering.
[21:21.120 --> 21:25.240]  And as we've been doing an excellent job covering here, obviously, very intensely in the last
[21:25.240 --> 21:26.240]  few months.
[21:26.240 --> 21:30.760]  But right now, let's go back to this Bill Maher with the Democratic Party operative he's
[21:30.760 --> 21:31.760]  got on there.
[21:31.760 --> 21:36.400]  And Bill Maher had just started saying, do I get any medical autonomy?
[21:36.400 --> 21:37.400]  Do I have any?
[21:37.400 --> 21:39.080]  And the guy's like, oh, yeah, you have it.
[21:39.080 --> 21:40.080]  Maybe.
[21:40.080 --> 21:41.080]  Well, we could take it away.
[21:41.080 --> 21:46.120]  I mean, this is just so on a scale of one to 100, it's 110.
[21:46.120 --> 21:54.320]  I mean, it's just cartoon level 1984 science fiction dystopia.
[21:54.320 --> 21:56.760]  And it doesn't even work.
[21:56.760 --> 22:01.000]  I mean, if it worked, we would go, OK, they're using a good drug to get a global database
[22:01.000 --> 22:06.440]  to control us to get rid of our rights and we'll be set up later under their control.
[22:06.440 --> 22:10.240]  That's like in childhoods in that was written by Arthur C. Clark that launches his whole
[22:10.240 --> 22:14.000]  career at the globalist, you know, uses a template of their actual plan.
[22:14.000 --> 22:17.880]  The aliens show up and won't really show themselves, but they give us life extension
[22:17.880 --> 22:21.600]  where we stop dying.
[22:21.600 --> 22:24.520]  And it takes a generation or two till we find out, well, it's because they're actually going
[22:24.520 --> 22:27.360]  to take our bodies and take our steel, our souls.
[22:27.360 --> 22:31.280]  Oh, and the aliens don't look too friendly either.
[22:31.280 --> 22:34.720]  So there it worked 100%.
[22:34.720 --> 22:38.560]  Like they come and they give you something that works, but they get full control doing
[22:38.560 --> 22:39.560]  it.
[22:39.560 --> 22:45.480]  They don't even like having real peanut butter or cheese on the mousetrap.
[22:45.480 --> 22:50.800]  It's just a mousetrap that you see killing mice and there's not even a piece of food
[22:50.800 --> 22:55.680]  on the trap and you still just run and jump into it.
[22:55.680 --> 22:57.360]  It's the murder of common sense.
[22:57.360 --> 23:02.320]  Just again, we're going to scan everything on your phone remotely.
[23:02.320 --> 23:05.720]  And then they put billboards up and we're saying Apple equals privacy.
[23:05.720 --> 23:07.320]  You're like, that's gaslighting.
[23:07.320 --> 23:12.760]  It's behavioral psychologists and running corporations that are in a revolution against
[23:12.760 --> 23:13.760]  us.
[23:13.760 --> 23:18.320]  That's why there's sudden Satanism on TV and pedophilia on TV and world government on
[23:18.320 --> 23:22.560]  TV and all these lies because they're getting ready for a total financial collapse.
[23:22.560 --> 23:27.960]  And, you know, we really should just talk about that because this demoralization, these
[23:27.960 --> 23:31.320]  poison shots, that's just getting us ready for the collapse.
[23:31.320 --> 23:35.000]  And you know, you tune in here to get tomorrow's news today.
[23:35.000 --> 23:37.480]  So we'll start the next hour.
[23:37.480 --> 23:41.600]  I'm going to get more into what's coming next in this total collapse because there's
[23:41.600 --> 23:45.280]  still time to mitigate how bad it's going to be, but not much.
[23:45.280 --> 23:49.080]  And so I want everybody to know who the authors of their enslavement and destruction is.
[23:49.080 --> 23:51.240]  So we'll be laying that out as well.
[23:51.240 --> 23:54.800]  We have some big special guests I'll tell you about in the next segment, but first, let's
[23:54.800 --> 23:56.280]  go back to Bill Maher.
[23:56.280 --> 23:58.640]  So is my body different?
[23:58.640 --> 24:01.360]  Can I have some medical autonomy?
[24:01.360 --> 24:02.360]  No.
[24:02.360 --> 24:03.360]  Look.
[24:03.360 --> 24:08.640]  Absolutely, no one is mandating it for you in your particular position, although they
[24:08.640 --> 24:09.640]  might.
[24:09.640 --> 24:14.240]  But I do think that it's very dangerous to enter into a conversation here about personal
[24:14.240 --> 24:19.320]  responsibility when the truth of the matter is that this is a matter of collective responsibility.
[24:19.320 --> 24:24.240]  If large groups of people do not get vaccinated, they go to the hospital and our hospitals
[24:24.240 --> 24:25.240]  get overrun.
[24:25.240 --> 24:26.880]  That's why you can't get a mammogram.
[24:26.880 --> 24:29.720]  You can't get a biopsy and so many other things.
[24:29.720 --> 24:32.000]  Literally society as we know it can't function.
[24:32.000 --> 24:36.800]  So this is important that people are urged to get vaccinated.
[24:36.800 --> 24:38.000]  It's important that they do get vaccinated.
[24:38.000 --> 24:40.600]  That's why I use.
[24:40.600 --> 24:46.240]  That's why I said the team.
[24:46.240 --> 24:53.120]  Well, we're proud to have you on today because I did it for the team.
[24:53.120 --> 24:54.120]  Max.
[24:54.120 --> 24:57.240]  What's that idiot's name?
[24:57.240 --> 24:58.240]  Rose.
[24:58.240 --> 25:00.160]  Where do they dig these people up?
[25:00.160 --> 25:05.160]  So all that's double speak, all that's tyranny, former congressman from New York, of course.
[25:05.160 --> 25:09.040]  Okay, so let's go ahead.
[25:09.040 --> 25:12.840]  And of course, Max Rose isn't going to take care of you when your kid gets cancer from
[25:12.840 --> 25:16.800]  the shot or when you cut your uterus out because of it, which is happening, or you get blood
[25:16.800 --> 25:18.600]  clots and have a stroke.
[25:18.600 --> 25:20.240]  You won't pay for your nursing home.
[25:20.240 --> 25:24.840]  You bet your bottom dollar Max Rose hasn't taken the shots.
[25:24.840 --> 25:28.320]  There's also this thing I see on Twitter and Instagram without even looking just everywhere.
[25:28.320 --> 25:31.160]  I bet Alex Jones secretly took the shot.
[25:31.160 --> 25:32.680]  He just doesn't want you to have it.
[25:32.680 --> 25:34.200]  What the hell does that mean?
[25:34.200 --> 25:36.200]  You people are crazy.
[25:36.200 --> 25:38.080]  And I'm talking about the leftist man.
[25:38.080 --> 25:40.760]  They are just so authoritarian.
[25:40.760 --> 25:45.160]  Here's a Brett Farr getting asked about the so-called vaccines, the gene therapies that
[25:45.160 --> 25:48.520]  don't work other than making you sick on CNN.
[25:48.520 --> 25:52.400]  Another health issue that is facing football and well, everyone right now is COVID.
[25:52.400 --> 25:58.080]  The Falcons today became the first NFL team to say that they are 100% vaccinated.
[25:58.080 --> 26:01.080]  The NFL is a higher vaccination rate than the general population.
[26:01.080 --> 26:03.920]  They've been doing pretty well, but there are still some high-profile holdouts like
[26:03.920 --> 26:06.520]  Vikings, QB, Cousins.
[26:06.520 --> 26:11.720]  Why do you think there is still a struggle among some athletes, especially when people
[26:11.720 --> 26:15.320]  look to them as role models when it comes to the COVID vaccine?
[26:15.320 --> 26:19.400]  Well, there's a great deal of uncertainty.
[26:19.400 --> 26:23.200]  You hear one thing one day and you hear something that's totally different the next.
[26:23.200 --> 26:29.080]  So we're sort of the human trials, if you will, and I think some people are frightened
[26:29.080 --> 26:36.240]  by that and the conflicting info that we're all getting.
[26:36.240 --> 26:41.640]  But there isn't really conflicting info that the vaccine is safe, effective, and needed
[26:41.640 --> 26:44.560]  and is a public health matter.
[26:44.560 --> 26:46.160]  I mean, would you?
[26:46.160 --> 26:53.760]  Pause, back it up 10 seconds, safe, effective, and needed, safe, it has more deaths than
[26:53.760 --> 26:56.160]  all the vaccines ever combined up front.
[26:56.160 --> 27:00.960]  It doesn't work, they admit, and it's not needed and it's causing variants.
[27:00.960 --> 27:04.520]  But you just repeat that like parrots, don't you?
[27:04.520 --> 27:12.160]  To sit up there, nice pretty girl with your yes men on CNN attacking your enemy, the American
[27:12.160 --> 27:13.160]  people.
[27:13.160 --> 27:19.840]  In India, it won't take any of these shots, the Australians are 25% and they're not stupid.
[27:19.840 --> 27:23.640]  They got a big problem because so many people that took the shots are getting sick now with
[27:23.640 --> 27:30.440]  quote COVID from the shot, they're going to get their booster and even sicker and create
[27:30.440 --> 27:31.440]  more mutations.
[27:31.440 --> 27:36.560]  Well, there's national news everywhere, hundreds of news articles saying Alex Jones claims vaccines
[27:36.560 --> 27:37.560]  make you a mutant.
[27:37.560 --> 27:42.400]  Well, they do actually gene therapy change your genetics, they do mutate you like franken
[27:42.400 --> 27:45.880]  foods or whatever you know that Monsanto creates, but that's not what I meant by that.
[27:45.880 --> 27:51.200]  The full context I was saying creates mutant strains like that whole stack of articles
[27:51.200 --> 27:52.200]  that day on that.
[27:52.200 --> 27:57.120]  You guys repel me the mutant strain vaccines, vaccines causing mutant strains place.
[27:57.120 --> 27:58.120]  Thank you.
[27:58.120 --> 28:05.480]  Let's finish up with the Brett Farve clip info that the vaccine is safe, effective and
[28:05.480 --> 28:08.760]  needed and is a part is a public health matter.
[28:08.760 --> 28:14.600]  I mean, would you urge your current players to be getting a vaccine?
[28:14.600 --> 28:15.600]  Have you been vaccinated?
[28:15.600 --> 28:23.400]  I'd rather not say one way or the other, but I think it's not my place to say get the
[28:23.400 --> 28:24.960]  vaccine or don't get the vaccine.
[28:24.960 --> 28:31.240]  I think that's a matter of choice by all individuals and that's why we live in America.
[28:31.240 --> 28:36.200]  You yourself, I mean, you don't want to say, which I respect, but you don't trust the
[28:36.200 --> 28:37.200]  vaccines?
[28:37.200 --> 28:39.800]  Well, I think I think this is a pause.
[28:39.800 --> 28:42.800]  Hey, lady, when's the last time you visited your gynecologist?
[28:42.800 --> 28:45.080]  Did he stick his fingers in you?
[28:45.080 --> 28:47.200]  I mean, that's a root thing to say, isn't it?
[28:47.200 --> 28:51.120]  Because it's your medical records, lady, and he's got his medical records.
[28:51.120 --> 28:53.640]  You remember your body, your choice.
[28:53.640 --> 28:58.200]  Understand, stay out of my body, CNN, which stay with us.
[28:58.200 --> 29:03.520]  Hey, everybody, confused about staying healthy in a crazy COVID culture.
[29:03.520 --> 29:04.520]  Me too.
[29:04.520 --> 29:08.720]  Listen, after all the research, all the conflicting studies, after all the squabbling, there's
[29:08.720 --> 29:11.440]  one thing almost everyone agrees on.
[29:11.440 --> 29:15.760]  It's that immune system health can literally be the difference between life and death.
[29:15.760 --> 29:17.480]  You probably already believe that.
[29:17.480 --> 29:18.680]  I certainly do.
[29:18.680 --> 29:19.680]  So here's the thing.
[29:19.680 --> 29:24.040]  I wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant-based substances actually
[29:24.040 --> 29:28.120]  have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support.
[29:28.120 --> 29:33.920]  Now, you'll have to sign a waiver, but you can check out what I've discovered at strongerdefence.com.
[29:33.920 --> 29:39.120]  No cures or treatments there, instead, little-known but shocking immune system research, and a
[29:39.120 --> 29:44.480]  breakthrough immune support product based on that research called Immune 10x.
[29:44.480 --> 29:48.440]  In the best part, you can go to the Stronger Defense website right now and claim your own
[29:48.440 --> 29:52.320]  supply of Immune 10x without paying anything today.
[29:52.320 --> 29:53.320]  Crazy, right?
[29:53.320 --> 30:04.800]  Let's talk about this unusual, limited-time offer at strongerdefense.com that's strongerdefense.com.
[30:04.800 --> 30:05.800]  Granny Do Right.
[30:05.800 --> 30:06.800]  Granny Do Right.
[30:06.800 --> 30:07.800]  Thanks for holding her on the ear.
[30:07.800 --> 30:08.800]  Go ahead.
[30:08.800 --> 30:11.160]  Yeah, and first of all, let me say I love your products.
[30:11.160 --> 30:16.680]  I am a granny, and for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in
[30:16.680 --> 30:22.160]  the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called.
[30:22.160 --> 30:28.120]  Since taking your X2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous, actually.
[30:28.120 --> 30:31.480]  People think I'm 55 years old.
[30:31.480 --> 30:35.480]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's
[30:35.480 --> 30:39.760]  what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation, but when I started
[30:39.760 --> 30:44.760]  taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately, but, you know, over a period of time, I started
[30:44.760 --> 30:49.840]  noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket, this is working, this is wonderful, you know,
[30:49.840 --> 30:56.160]  I don't, I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know, so anyway, it worked wonderfully
[30:56.160 --> 31:01.000]  and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[31:01.000 --> 31:04.680]  Not all vitamin and mineral supplements are equal.
[31:04.680 --> 31:05.680]  Many of them are synthetic.
[31:05.680 --> 31:07.760]  Many of them have fillers and additives.
[31:07.760 --> 31:11.960]  Many of them just pass right through the body and are not absorbed, but that's not the case
[31:11.960 --> 31:16.400]  with our incredibly popular, because it's so effective product that it's not been sold
[31:16.400 --> 31:19.320]  out for months, but it's finally back in stock.
[31:19.320 --> 31:24.640]  And that is vitamin, mineral fusion, all the essential vitamins, all the essential minerals,
[31:24.640 --> 31:29.200]  a bunch of key amino acids to help it upload better into your body and your cells.
[31:29.200 --> 31:33.320]  It's in powder form, it's great for children, it's great for adults, it's really important
[31:33.320 --> 31:37.320]  for folks that are older because they don't absorb as well through their guts, so this
[31:37.320 --> 31:39.320]  liquid formula really, really does it.
[31:39.320 --> 31:43.000]  You mix up a picture of it every couple of days, put it in the refrigerator, or keep
[31:43.000 --> 31:46.960]  it out in the kitchen, and just remember to drink it in the morning and in the evening.
[31:46.960 --> 31:52.120]  It tastes great, it makes your body healthy, it boosts your immune system, and it funds
[31:52.120 --> 31:53.120]  the info war.
[31:53.120 --> 31:57.720]  A true 360 win, so vitamin, mineral fusion sold out for months, it's back in stock for
[31:57.720 --> 32:01.120]  a limited time, 33% off infowarstore.com.
[32:01.120 --> 32:06.280]  Let's go back in time, say to the mid 1990s, and then imagine a science fiction movie set
[32:06.280 --> 32:11.280]  in the year 2020, where a world government's being established, where members of Congress
[32:11.280 --> 32:16.200]  and former presidents are censored by big tech, and where if you don't take an experimental
[32:16.200 --> 32:22.160]  injection that grows blood plots and prions all over your body, then you're not allowed
[32:22.160 --> 32:24.760]  to fly on an airplane.
[32:24.760 --> 32:27.400]  Think about that, because that's where we are.
[32:27.400 --> 32:32.200]  Imagine just 20, 30 years ago, tell us just five years ago, if somebody told you this
[32:32.200 --> 32:37.440]  would be happening, but it is happening now, and then they tell you, oh sorry, it's not
[32:37.440 --> 32:41.440]  a vaccine, it's a gene therapy, and it doesn't really work, so you gotta take it every few
[32:41.440 --> 32:42.440]  months.
[32:42.440 --> 32:46.960]  The people that have submitted say, great, I wanna take it all the time so I can go outside
[32:46.960 --> 32:50.720]  and not get sick from COVID, even though it gets you sick from COVID, and now there's
[32:50.720 --> 32:54.960]  record numbers of really sick people from the sloughing, the shedding of the virus,
[32:54.960 --> 32:57.000]  and that's in mainline studies.
[32:57.000 --> 33:03.960]  Bill Gates and Fauci did this, need to go to prison for it right now.
[33:03.960 --> 33:30.640]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:30.640 --> 33:47.400]  Our work doesn't stop there, and we're going to continue to press to get 12 to 18 year
[33:47.400 --> 34:02.200]  old vaccinated.
[34:02.200 --> 34:11.280]  Six and four year olds would likely be able to get vaccinated.
[34:11.280 --> 34:12.280]  And you would recommend it?
[34:12.280 --> 34:21.840]  Oh, absolutely, if I had grandchildren, I would certainly recommend they get vaccinated.
[34:21.840 --> 34:25.600]  Specifically at the under 12 age group.
[34:25.600 --> 34:32.680]  The fact that we were not allowed to play on the playground or have student council
[34:32.680 --> 34:39.840]  or face each other at lunch, we also have to wear masks outside at PE.
[34:39.840 --> 34:51.400]  One teacher walks around with a clipboard full of referrals for any student who's mask
[34:51.400 --> 34:52.400]  isn't on properly.
[34:52.400 --> 35:16.800]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, well, here we are.
[35:16.800 --> 35:18.720]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[35:18.720 --> 35:25.840]  That was an abrupt ending there, wasn't it, and I was like, not ready for that.
[35:25.840 --> 35:35.000]  But here we are, ladies and gentlemen, on this live August 24, 2021 transmission.
[35:35.000 --> 35:41.680]  And I guess I should probably tell you about some of the guests that are coming up here
[35:41.680 --> 35:42.680]  today.
[35:42.680 --> 35:52.760]  Dr. Sean M. Brooks, PhD, who was speaking in his home state and gave a really good speech
[35:52.760 --> 35:57.280]  at his alma mater high school about the tyranny that was taking place.
[35:57.280 --> 36:00.640]  I think it's one of the best spoken people I've heard yet.
[36:00.640 --> 36:05.240]  And so he's going to be joining us in the third hour, a little bit into the fourth
[36:05.240 --> 36:18.760]  hour today, and then political prisoner Owen Schreuer will be joining us coming up in the
[36:18.760 --> 36:23.240]  last 45 minutes of the fourth hour.
[36:23.240 --> 36:29.520]  He was only in jail for about four or five hours in the federal jail yesterday, and the
[36:29.520 --> 36:34.080]  judge put some restrictions on him, not to talk to people involved in January 6 about
[36:34.080 --> 36:35.800]  the case.
[36:35.800 --> 36:40.240]  But at the same time, he is a talk show host and everything he did is on body cam.
[36:40.240 --> 36:43.440]  So what we did is on record.
[36:43.440 --> 36:48.560]  And so Owen will be here just in general, talking about the news and covering information.
[36:48.560 --> 36:58.920]  But the left got very upset, very, very, very upset to learn that Owen was not taken away
[36:58.920 --> 37:01.320]  to D.C. to be put in solitary confinement.
[37:01.320 --> 37:08.640]  There's literally his name trended yesterday, so mine in the top 10 of Twitter with people
[37:08.640 --> 37:14.000]  wishing for his death, people wishing for his execution.
[37:14.000 --> 37:18.440]  I don't even hate these weird people on Twitter and on other platforms.
[37:18.440 --> 37:24.920]  I just, I feel sorry for him because they are such authoritarians, but they're not even
[37:24.920 --> 37:26.160]  part of the power structure.
[37:26.160 --> 37:33.360]  They're just there like a mob wanting to exact revenge on those of us that have just simply
[37:33.360 --> 37:38.080]  tried to save the country, and then they can see who they stole the election for and who
[37:38.080 --> 37:46.600]  they installed destroying everyone's future, but they can't even seem to figure that out.
[37:46.600 --> 37:52.120]  Now there are so many powerful John Bowne reports that he's been doing lately, and I
[37:52.120 --> 37:54.920]  enjoy talking on the show.
[37:54.920 --> 37:59.160]  But at the same time, when we get really, really powerful reports and things in, I think it's
[37:59.160 --> 38:03.240]  really important to air those on the broadcast.
[38:03.240 --> 38:06.880]  And so we're going to play this report right now.
[38:06.880 --> 38:12.600]  The media celebrates World War 4 plague.
[38:12.600 --> 38:16.560]  And then we also have the treasonous propaganda holdouts.
[38:16.560 --> 38:17.800]  These are all really important.
[38:17.800 --> 38:21.800]  I already played at the start of the show, but I think it's one of his best reports in
[38:21.800 --> 38:26.840]  a long time, and it really codifies the fraud of these people, and that's the COVID tyranny
[38:26.840 --> 38:29.720]  meets resistance worldwide.
[38:29.720 --> 38:34.400]  That is such an incredibly important transmission.
[38:34.400 --> 38:40.440]  And I'm really proud of the listeners so we can go to the front page of Band-Aid video.
[38:40.440 --> 38:51.280]  The little short four-minute clip of Dr. Sean M. Brooks only had about 80,000 views yesterday.
[38:51.280 --> 38:56.960]  Whenever we mentioned it, I said, that needs to go viral, and you guys did an incredible
[38:56.960 --> 38:57.960]  job.
[38:57.960 --> 39:02.760]  It now has 1,051,700-plus views.
[39:02.760 --> 39:08.200]  And then if everybody, you told to share it, if they just shared it, it would have 10 million.
[39:08.200 --> 39:11.560]  And then if they shared it, it'd have 100 million, and it'd be game over.
[39:11.560 --> 39:22.000]  Now yes, the bills that we get because Prison Planet is now unfolding, and people know that
[39:22.000 --> 39:26.360]  we have a lot of credibility, so our visitors are exploding.
[39:26.360 --> 39:31.960]  And so the bills that we get over at Band-Aid video, which again is not the URL to share
[39:31.960 --> 39:36.720]  because they blocked that, you want to share the URL, freeworldnews.tv, they're not censoring
[39:36.720 --> 39:37.720]  that yet.
[39:37.720 --> 39:46.160]  The bills that we get are just stratospheric, millions of dollars a quarter just in bandwidth
[39:46.160 --> 39:49.280]  around this operation, and it's getting more insane.
[39:49.280 --> 39:54.200]  And we're always shopping around, always trying to get better deals, we buy a lot of bandwidth,
[39:54.200 --> 39:59.040]  but you have to understand that we're doing it all, the satellite uplinks, the encoders,
[39:59.040 --> 40:00.040]  everything is us.
[40:00.040 --> 40:04.600]  And so when you see an iPhone, that is hundreds of billions of dollars of investment to make
[40:04.600 --> 40:05.600]  that.
[40:05.600 --> 40:06.800]  When you see a droid, it's the same thing.
[40:06.800 --> 40:11.520]  When you see Google, that's trillions over the years, the last 25 years that have been
[40:11.520 --> 40:14.080]  spent to build that infrastructure, trillions.
[40:14.080 --> 40:19.360]  Same thing with Apple, and same thing with those other companies like the big telecoms.
[40:19.360 --> 40:26.840]  So when I tell you that we need tens of millions of dollars, we're like David versus Goliath,
[40:26.840 --> 40:32.040]  but Goliath is a thousand feet tall, and we're about six inches tall, but the truth is so
[40:32.040 --> 40:37.280]  powerful that when we're able to fire the truth out, it still has a bigger effect than
[40:37.280 --> 40:38.560]  their trillions of dollars.
[40:38.560 --> 40:42.960]  But that's what this comes down to, is to do what we're doing and to be on hundreds
[40:42.960 --> 40:47.960]  of radio stations and TV stations and to be just dominating all over the place and to
[40:47.960 --> 40:52.720]  see them so mad on Facebook and YouTube and Twitter saying, how do we still hear of Alex
[40:52.720 --> 40:53.720]  Jones?
[40:53.720 --> 40:54.720]  Why is he still trending?
[40:54.720 --> 40:57.240]  Why is he still getting millions of viewers every day?
[40:57.240 --> 41:00.080]  And it's all because of you supporting us.
[41:00.080 --> 41:03.720]  It's all because of you taking action.

[42:54.960 --> 42:59.720]  All right, we'll be back, stay with us.
[42:59.720 --> 43:04.560]  Humanity is the main stakeholder on this planet, but the big corporations for a hundred
[43:04.560 --> 43:08.240]  years have told us that humans are bad and evil, and it pestles us on the earth so that
[43:08.240 --> 43:12.640]  we begin to believe we're bad and we'll turn off our life force and let the eugenics based
[43:12.640 --> 43:14.640]  globalists take control of the planet.
[43:14.640 --> 43:20.280]  If you go to Klaus Schwab, the evidence group's own Wikipedia page, he brags on there about
[43:20.280 --> 43:25.480]  how they're capturing democracy and taking over governments worldwide to set up a corporate
[43:25.480 --> 43:27.400]  dictatorship under the UN.
[43:27.400 --> 43:33.480]  They admit all of this, they plan the lockdowns, they release the viruses, they think you're
[43:33.480 --> 43:39.040]  stupid and their plan is to slowly cut off the resources so they can dictate total social
[43:39.040 --> 43:40.560]  control over you and your lives.
[43:40.560 --> 43:46.240]  That's how I was able to predict everything they did decades before they executed it,
[43:46.240 --> 43:51.640]  word for word with total precision, because they have a detailed battle plan.
[43:51.640 --> 43:57.080]  We cover it live weekdays, 11 a.m. at 3 p.m. at infowarfstore.com, tell everybody to tune
[43:57.080 --> 43:59.440]  in now and war the world.
[43:59.440 --> 44:04.240]  So when I first started taking survival skills, basically I was 275 pounds, I was overweight,
[44:04.240 --> 44:09.120]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe, I was barely holding onto a job, and I heard
[44:09.120 --> 44:11.160]  Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it.
[44:11.160 --> 44:15.760]  So the first one I got was the original survival shield, the X1, and it worked pretty good.
[44:15.760 --> 44:19.480]  And then shortly thereafter you came out with that too, you had with the deep burn source
[44:19.480 --> 44:23.480]  you know, and I got really excited about that so I took it, and then in two weeks I went
[44:23.480 --> 44:29.440]  from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened, you know, I could think again,
[44:29.440 --> 44:34.360]  I could connect with people again, and over the course of the next couple of years I got
[44:34.360 --> 44:39.080]  my health back and I religiously take basically all of your supplements, they're all absolutely
[44:39.080 --> 44:40.080]  amazing supplements.
[44:40.080 --> 44:44.320]  The one I like recently is knockout, literally like if you want to sleep just take it, it's
[44:44.320 --> 44:45.320]  amazing, it works.
[44:45.320 --> 44:49.440]  But anyway, so the point is we have to get ourselves clean, we have to break free of
[44:49.440 --> 44:53.440]  the globalist system, and the only way to do that is to take our own health into our
[44:53.440 --> 44:54.440]  own hands.
[44:54.440 --> 44:57.800]  Beautifully said brother, I thank you so much for your call and Godspeed.
[44:57.800 --> 45:06.240]  You say you want to fight tyranny, you say you want to fund the Second American Revolution,

[46:00.400 --> 46:06.080]  Bio remediation is a process used to treat contaminating water, soil, and subsurface material
[46:06.080 --> 46:10.560]  by accelerating naturally occurring environmental conditions to stimulate growth of microorganisms
[46:10.560 --> 46:12.480]  and degrade targeted pollutants.
[46:12.480 --> 46:17.560]  For the first time, the bio pros are bringing to the public market a suite of bio remediation
[46:17.560 --> 46:19.580]  products to the everyday consumer.
[46:19.580 --> 46:24.260]  Their first product they are launching is called BioSeptic Pro, a product specifically
[46:24.260 --> 46:27.240]  designed to establish a healthy septic system.
[46:27.240 --> 46:31.600]  BioSeptic Pro contains live microorganisms, not traditional enzymes like its competitors.
[46:31.600 --> 46:36.200]  This stuff lives in your septic system, it's really like probiotics for your septic tank,
[46:36.200 --> 46:41.480]  and is at least 100 times more effective than similar microbial products due to its revolutionary
[46:41.480 --> 46:43.400]  patented delivery system.
[46:43.400 --> 46:47.840]  BioSeptic Pro contains no chemical ingredients and no genetically modified organisms.

[46:53.840 --> 47:03.440]  This is for anaerobic septic tanks, and the job it does is unparalleled, thebiopros.com.
[47:03.440 --> 47:25.080]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:25.080 --> 47:28.440]  Welcome back.
[47:28.440 --> 47:30.440]  It really is true we're the tip of the spear.
[47:30.440 --> 47:36.760]  I'm going to talk about the path out of this and the solutions at the start of the next
[47:36.760 --> 47:39.680]  hour, and I'm also going to lay out what the globalists are going to do next if we don't
[47:39.680 --> 47:43.640]  stop them, which really means we don't have a choice.
[47:43.640 --> 47:48.800]  There's so much coming up obviously today, another very, very important broadcast, we're
[47:48.800 --> 47:51.920]  just blessed to be here.
[47:51.920 --> 47:56.760]  But let me right now here on the Alex Jones show get into this, if I just wanted to make
[47:56.760 --> 48:00.440]  Joe Biden look bad, we could fill the whole four-hour show every day with it.
[48:00.440 --> 48:05.080]  He's designed to make America look bad, he's designed to demoralize, he's designed to make
[48:05.080 --> 48:11.400]  the country look incompetent, and under globalist chai-com control.
[48:11.400 --> 48:16.760]  And that's why the Taliban has now come out and said, this is a red line, you will leave
[48:16.760 --> 48:21.640]  by August 31st.
[48:21.640 --> 48:29.120]  A week ago, the leader of the Taliban said you have until September 11th, but they know
[48:29.120 --> 48:35.280]  that Biden is scared and that Biden has basically been ordered to do this by his handlers and
[48:35.280 --> 48:41.480]  is now committed because the Taliban has been in control, the globalists have been in control
[48:41.480 --> 48:48.000]  the Taliban since the 1970s, and the CIA has had secret agreements with them the entire
[48:48.000 --> 48:49.000]  time.
[48:49.000 --> 48:55.800]  The truth is the Taliban was not killed or removed on September 11th when the U.S. attacked
[48:55.800 --> 49:03.560]  Kabul on September 12th, more than 30,000 Taliban were flown out to safety in the airlift
[49:03.560 --> 49:09.120]  of evil by the CIA, and the Taliban ordered basically 14 and 15-year-old boys to stay
[49:09.120 --> 49:14.000]  in frontline positions to be bombed and killed by the U.S., and that whole takeover of Afghanistan
[49:14.000 --> 49:16.880]  was completely staged.
[49:16.880 --> 49:21.760]  There have been some real tribal groups attacking the troops and some real attacks going on,
[49:21.760 --> 49:26.520]  and then the Taliban did double back and attack and double cross the CIA, but that's what
[49:26.520 --> 49:27.520]  they do.
[49:27.520 --> 49:34.120]  So the CIA put the Mullahs in power in Iran in 79, they put the Taliban in power in 79,
[49:34.120 --> 49:38.640]  they put Al Qaeda and ISIS and the Taliban in charge of the invasions all over the Middle
[49:38.640 --> 49:42.000]  East and Africa, and so it's the same story over and over again.
[49:42.000 --> 49:45.560]  The CIA is run by what ran British intelligence.
[49:45.560 --> 49:49.720]  It's not British intelligence now, it's a global corporate criminal combine, and that's
[49:49.720 --> 49:50.720]  all mainline history.
[49:50.720 --> 49:55.960]  You saw that in Syria, you saw it in Libya, you saw it in Egypt, you saw fast and furious,
[49:55.960 --> 50:00.320]  more than 5 million guns shipped out of the U.S. to Mexico to be shipped for the Arab
[50:00.320 --> 50:08.040]  Spring by Obama, and now the same law firms suing me and suing others are trying to sue
[50:08.040 --> 50:13.360]  the gun industry out of business, saying it's their fault that guns got into Mexico and
[50:13.360 --> 50:19.840]  went overseas, and Mexico is now suing 20-plus gun manufacturers, but they'll never sue Obama
[50:19.840 --> 50:26.040]  who actually ran the whole thing, though it did make Eric Holder, then head of the
[50:26.040 --> 50:33.080]  Justice Department, step down when it turned out he was giving the orders, directing it.
[50:33.080 --> 50:41.080]  So this is just all part of the globalists using their secret proxy army, but now Biden
[50:41.080 --> 50:48.440]  suggests Kamala Harris will be president pretty soon, he just said this, here it is.
[50:48.440 --> 50:54.560]  My two daughters were born, that you can do anything a man can do, it's one thing for
[50:54.560 --> 50:57.960]  somebody to say that and keep pounding that in the head of their five granddaughters as
[50:57.960 --> 51:05.440]  well, but guess what, until they see it, until they watch, it becomes real then, that's why
[51:05.440 --> 51:10.200]  by the way she's, it happens to be in Asia for me right now, but that's why we have a
[51:10.200 --> 51:14.520]  female vice president in the United States of America, who's going to be, we're going
[51:14.520 --> 51:16.720]  to have some presidents pretty soon.
[51:16.720 --> 51:22.640]  Yep, there you go, it's all been preplanned, all been prepared, he's senile, he's black
[51:22.640 --> 51:27.040]  male, he's a Chinese agent, they got the child porn of him and kids, child porn of
[51:27.040 --> 51:32.360]  him and his son having sex with their own kids, their own family, it's all on there,
[51:32.360 --> 51:39.360]  they have sex with all his children, they all have sex with each other, his wife wears
[51:39.360 --> 51:44.360]  what a 20 year old prostitute would wear on TV, I mean these people are scum, you talk
[51:44.360 --> 51:53.240]  about something out of a nightmare, out of a Rob Zombie movie, they are the real deal.
[51:53.240 --> 51:57.600]  So let's look at some of these headlines, negotiating with terrorist, Biden's CIA director, former
[51:57.600 --> 52:03.040]  head of the Carnegie Endowment, fails to secure deadline extension from Taliban, it's
[52:03.040 --> 52:06.920]  all staged.
[52:06.920 --> 52:12.200]  Biden told U.S. commanders not to send out troops for rescue Americans trapped in Kabul
[52:12.200 --> 52:19.880]  because he feared a Black Hawk down moment, it would make him look bad.
[52:19.880 --> 52:24.480]  American mom stranded in Afghanistan, carefully begs Joe Biden to send help, I don't know
[52:24.480 --> 52:27.880]  if I'm ever going to see my children again.
[52:27.880 --> 52:33.120]  The Biden effect, France, UK, Italy and Germany, turned to Putin and Russia for assistance
[52:33.120 --> 52:36.200]  in Afghanistan.
[52:36.200 --> 52:41.480]  Next to the Joe Biden, the Taliban now has over 200 military aircraft, ranks them as
[52:41.480 --> 52:47.360]  the 26th in the list of nations in combat aircraft strength, you think they couldn't
[52:47.360 --> 52:49.400]  fly aircraft out?
[52:49.400 --> 52:54.480]  Saki falsely claims Americans not stranded in Taliban controlled Afghanistan, should
[52:54.480 --> 53:03.960]  probably claim the vaccine works, next two and it just goes on and on and on, U.S. collected
[53:03.960 --> 53:08.640]  biometric equipment and data has fallen into the hands of the Taliban, it's now confirmed,
[53:08.640 --> 53:13.640]  we weren't sure last week.
[53:13.640 --> 53:20.080]  But now supposedly Biden will order U.S. troops to rescue Americans stranded in Kabul.
[53:20.080 --> 53:24.480]  Kamala Harris though, was over in Singapore and she wouldn't answer questions, she says
[53:24.480 --> 53:29.920]  the time for analyzing is later, yeah that's right, you've forgotten about it, meanwhile
[53:29.920 --> 53:35.760]  neocons and left-wingers are pushing, bringing all the Afghans here, yes, yes we need more
[53:35.760 --> 53:42.080]  people like Ilhan Omar, the U.S. should take as many African, excuse me, Afghan refugees
[53:42.080 --> 53:49.120]  as it can, thinking of Ilhan Omar from Somalia, save as a little girl and she even attacked
[53:49.120 --> 53:54.520]  the troops that saved her, she has no level of decency.
[53:54.520 --> 53:59.200]  And then here's one from Forbes, oh they got mixed in with my Joe Biden stack, I'd
[53:59.200 --> 54:10.880]  lost this, oh look, Pfizer shot just 39% effective against COVID now, oh my gosh, 39%, but you
[54:10.880 --> 54:19.160]  heard it work so well, next hour I've got the Surgeon General saying, oh natural immunity
[54:19.160 --> 54:24.960]  is not good, oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, mother's milk is not good, no, no, formula
[54:24.960 --> 54:30.200]  is what you want, but natural immunity is so much better than these shots, it's saying
[54:30.200 --> 54:36.960]  you don't want mother's milk, you want to give the baby cyanide or Drano, don't give
[54:36.960 --> 54:41.320]  that baby that, babies never drink mother's milk, you know I used to joke and I said they'll
[54:41.320 --> 54:45.680]  come at a time when they claim it's a conspiracy theory that mothers ever breastfed, they're
[54:45.680 --> 54:49.120]  trying to phase that out because it makes people not as smart, not as healthy, pretty
[54:49.120 --> 54:54.880]  good, your natural vaccines is the colostrum and now we're pretty much to that point most
[54:54.880 --> 55:00.200]  births are cesarean, most people don't breastfeed and you can see it, I mean it's sad, people
[55:00.200 --> 55:06.480]  are dull, they're dumbed down, they don't have a life force, they're asleep and that's
[55:06.480 --> 55:10.200]  the thing I found pretty much with anybody, if you can get through to them and get them
[55:10.200 --> 55:14.840]  to make connections to God and the universe and their ancestors that they can activate
[55:14.840 --> 55:18.720]  and get through the fog and come out of the trance and I think more and more instead of
[55:18.720 --> 55:23.200]  just covering all the news and all the information, we should talk about the spirituality and God
[55:23.200 --> 55:29.320]  and how to get out of the trance and ways to break the conditioning and just whether
[55:29.320 --> 55:34.760]  you're old or young or black or white or male or female or where you live, the real
[55:34.760 --> 55:41.160]  thing is it's a growing process and I'm not perfect either and it's fun to bash liberals
[55:41.160 --> 55:44.440]  and it's fun to get mad at them and it's fun to talk about how stupid they are but that's
[55:44.440 --> 55:51.120]  a reflection on us that we've let that happen and so I really, I love all these people other
[55:51.120 --> 55:55.840]  than conscious demons like Fauci and Bill Gates and people at the very top but most of these
[55:55.840 --> 55:59.840]  people are scared, they're just trying to belong to something, they're trying to go
[55:59.840 --> 56:03.760]  along with the system and they're finding out they're losing all their medical autonomy,
[56:03.760 --> 56:07.560]  all their future, all their freedom and they know deep down that it's a fraud so they're
[56:07.560 --> 56:13.320]  scared and we've got to reach out to them in a loving, nice way and try to get people
[56:13.320 --> 56:17.680]  on our side that way because I've had the big brash approach and that's been successful
[56:17.680 --> 56:21.160]  with a lot of people and I think I should still have it sometimes but I really, God's
[56:21.160 --> 56:25.080]  really letting it on my heart that we need to just get back to really loving people
[56:25.080 --> 56:31.240]  and really valuing humanity and really caring about everybody and realizing that love is
[56:31.240 --> 56:35.560]  the answer but also action, you've got to love people but you've got to then put the
[56:35.560 --> 56:39.960]  action into it of saying no to the system and then standing in the way of the globalist
[56:39.960 --> 56:44.080]  so we're going to go to break and come back with a really powerful John Bound report and
[56:44.080 --> 56:48.320]  then I'm going to get into what the world's going to look like if we don't turn this around
[56:48.320 --> 56:53.920]  and if we don't stop this and why these globalists are doing it.
[56:53.920 --> 56:57.760]  So many times I'm in the morning and I just see the whole future and see all the thousands
[56:57.760 --> 57:02.120]  of data points, millions of data points together and I see the angles of how to stop it and
[57:02.120 --> 57:08.880]  how to overcome it and I have this huge mental picture and then I've got to go on air and
[57:08.880 --> 57:13.080]  explain this to people and then I'll be on air and capture a lot of that same essence
[57:13.080 --> 57:18.160]  but then it's hard to telegraph it forward but there's been many magic moments on here,
[57:18.160 --> 57:24.160]  sometimes three, four minute stream of consciousness where it's just so powerful and you know
[57:24.160 --> 57:29.280]  it's coming from somewhere beyond me and that's what I'm seeking to try to bring you because
[57:29.280 --> 57:31.360]  that's always in my mind.
[57:31.360 --> 57:35.520]  I know every angle of the enemy up, down, side, the other but trying to articulate it
[57:35.520 --> 57:37.160]  and I know you do as well.
[57:37.160 --> 57:40.720]  The question for all of us is how to articulate the spirit and the discernment we have through
[57:40.720 --> 57:43.800]  the third dimension to save the people and save ourselves.
[57:43.800 --> 57:44.800]  We'll be right back.
[57:44.800 --> 57:45.800]  Stay with us.
[57:45.800 --> 57:46.800]  Pray for justice.
[57:46.800 --> 57:47.800]  Pray for peace.
[57:47.800 --> 57:48.800]  Pray for love.
[57:48.800 --> 57:53.240]  Not all vitamin and mineral supplements are equal.
[57:53.240 --> 57:54.240]  Many of them are synthetic.
[57:54.240 --> 57:56.280]  Many of them have fillers and additives.
[57:56.280 --> 58:00.600]  Many of them just pass right through the body and are absorbed but that's not the case with
[58:00.600 --> 58:05.720]  our incredibly popular because it's so effective product that it's now been sold out for months
[58:05.720 --> 58:10.680]  but it's finally back in stock and that is vitamin mineral fusion.
[58:10.680 --> 58:15.000]  All the essential vitamins, all the essential minerals, a bunch of chiamino acids to help
[58:15.000 --> 58:17.720]  it upload better into your body and your cells.
[58:17.720 --> 58:18.720]  It's in powder form.
[58:18.720 --> 58:19.720]  It's great for children.
[58:19.720 --> 58:20.720]  It's great for adults.
[58:20.720 --> 58:24.720]  It's really important for folks that are older because they don't absorb as well through
[58:24.720 --> 58:25.720]  their guts.
[58:25.720 --> 58:27.720]  So this liquid formula really, really does it.
[58:27.720 --> 58:32.240]  You mix up a pitcher of it every couple days, put it in the refrigerator, keep it out in
[58:32.240 --> 58:35.440]  the kitchen and just remember to drink it in the morning and in the evening.
[58:35.440 --> 58:36.440]  It tastes great.
[58:36.440 --> 58:41.520]  It makes your body healthy, it boosts your immune system and it funds the infowar.
[58:41.520 --> 58:46.480]  A true 361, so vitamin mineral fusion sold out for months is back in stock for a limited
[58:46.480 --> 58:50.520]  time, 33% off in FullWareStore.com.
[58:50.520 --> 58:54.640]  So when I first started taking survival skills, basically I was 275 pounds.
[58:54.640 --> 58:55.640]  I was overweight.
[58:55.640 --> 58:57.720]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe.
[58:57.720 --> 59:02.280]  I was barely holding onto a job and I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it.
[59:02.280 --> 59:05.680]  So the first one I got was the original survival skills, the X1.
[59:05.680 --> 59:09.960]  It worked pretty good and then shortly thereafter you came out with that too, you had the deep
[59:09.960 --> 59:14.560]  burden source and I got really excited about that so I took it and man in two weeks I went
[59:14.560 --> 59:19.400]  from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened.
[59:19.400 --> 59:24.280]  I could think again, I could connect with people again and over the course of the next
[59:24.280 --> 59:29.040]  couple of years I got my health back and I religiously take basically all of your supplements.
[59:29.040 --> 59:31.040]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[59:31.040 --> 59:35.360]  The one I like recently is knockout literally like if you want to sleep just take it.
[59:35.360 --> 59:36.360]  It's amazing.
[59:36.360 --> 59:37.360]  It works.
[59:37.360 --> 59:40.520]  But anyway, so the point is we have to get ourselves clean, we have to break free of
[59:40.520 --> 59:44.520]  the globalist system and the only way to do that is to take our own health into our
[59:44.520 --> 59:45.520]  own hands.
[59:45.520 --> 59:46.520]  Beautifully said brother.
[59:46.520 --> 59:53.320]  I thank you so much for your call and Godspeed.
[59:53.320 --> 1:00:07.560]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show all right, John bound is always knocking him out
[1:00:07.560 --> 1:00:08.560]  of the park.
[1:00:08.560 --> 1:00:11.320]  It's like our great, great, great smaller other contributors, but he's done three reports
[1:00:11.320 --> 1:00:12.320]  the last day.
[1:00:12.320 --> 1:00:14.080]  They're the John bound section of Band-Aid video.
[1:00:14.080 --> 1:00:15.080]  Here's one of them.
[1:00:15.080 --> 1:00:24.840]  He celebrates World War four here at us vaccine mandates have been what we as Americans have
[1:00:24.840 --> 1:00:33.760]  done for the past 50, 60 years to eradicate smallpox, try to get rid of polio, rubella.
[1:00:33.760 --> 1:00:39.360]  It's just not new and you're acting so shocked and some of you send me emails going, my liberties
[1:00:39.360 --> 1:00:40.360]  are being taken.
[1:00:40.360 --> 1:00:41.360]  No, they're not.
[1:00:41.360 --> 1:00:46.360]  No, no more than your liberties were being taken away when your parents were told that
[1:00:46.360 --> 1:00:52.000]  you couldn't get a public education if you didn't have six vaccine passports, but these
[1:00:52.000 --> 1:00:57.560]  conspiracy theories are not only making people stupid, they're making them sick and they're
[1:00:57.560 --> 1:01:01.920]  causing them to die and they're acting like this is something new and that's the most
[1:01:01.920 --> 1:01:02.920]  maddening thing.
[1:01:02.920 --> 1:01:04.880]  Oh, you said COVID wasn't real.
[1:01:04.880 --> 1:01:11.760]  Oh, no, it was a real virus they made in the lab where the vaccine response then causes
[1:01:11.760 --> 1:01:16.200]  massive mutations and all these new variants, which I predicted with top scientists on
[1:01:16.200 --> 1:01:17.200]  my show.
[1:01:17.200 --> 1:01:22.240]  I'm not even worthy to be bringing you information that's powerful and I hope that you pay attention
[1:01:22.240 --> 1:01:29.520]  to what we cover here minute by minute because I've had chills since last night.
[1:01:29.520 --> 1:01:37.000]  This just confirms everything else we've already researched, but Rockefeller study envisions
[1:01:37.000 --> 1:01:43.880]  future dictatorship controlled by elite, millions being killed, mandatory quarantines, checkpoints,
[1:01:43.880 --> 1:01:50.040]  the end of the family, everything that's in the other documents, but this dovetails with
[1:01:50.040 --> 1:01:53.760]  all the other Rockefeller Foundation documents about the GMO food to sterilize you and the
[1:01:53.760 --> 1:01:58.160]  forced vaccines and the hell we're already living in that's just going to continue to
[1:01:58.160 --> 1:02:02.960]  intensify until we take our governments back from these eugenics madmen.
[1:02:02.960 --> 1:02:06.840]  The question is, will you have the courage to really do the research yourself because
[1:02:06.840 --> 1:02:10.640]  I don't want you to just sit here and hear me make these claims.
[1:02:10.640 --> 1:02:15.480]  These people are so arrogant that they write policy papers, so many of them that they're
[1:02:15.480 --> 1:02:21.880]  producing these policy papers and reports and white papers so fast that you could never
[1:02:21.880 --> 1:02:22.880]  read them all.
[1:02:22.880 --> 1:02:27.480]  We're seeing a medical tyranny being set up, not just in the United States, but worldwide
[1:02:27.480 --> 1:02:30.560]  under the UN and the World Health Organization.
[1:02:30.560 --> 1:02:32.040]  Who's behind all this?
[1:02:32.040 --> 1:02:36.200]  The Bilderberg group, they want a planetary dictatorship so they can carry out their
[1:02:36.200 --> 1:02:40.160]  forced depopulation agenda and they want to do it through the medical system.
[1:02:40.160 --> 1:02:43.920]  And that's why vaccines are so important and I've got an insider I think you should really
[1:02:43.920 --> 1:02:46.640]  talk to, Dr. Rima Labo.
[1:02:46.640 --> 1:02:55.640]  Very soon, we'll be facing compulsory vaccination under the mistaken term of voluntary vaccination.
[1:02:55.640 --> 1:03:00.800]  Well, first of all, let's start with the fact that the World Health Organization has
[1:03:00.800 --> 1:03:05.560]  decided that we have 90% too many people.
[1:03:05.560 --> 1:03:09.760]  My name is Dr. Sean Brooks, Ph.D., Oxford.
[1:03:09.760 --> 1:03:15.320]  Dr. Robert Malone, who created the messenger RNA vaccine, has said no one should ever
[1:03:15.320 --> 1:03:17.800]  take these jabs ever.
[1:03:17.800 --> 1:03:22.960]  Under any circumstance whatsoever, he created it and he says don't ever do it.
[1:03:22.960 --> 1:03:26.720]  The people who have taken it are going to die in the next six months to three to five
[1:03:26.720 --> 1:03:29.280]  years for three reasons.
[1:03:29.280 --> 1:03:35.600]  Number one, you have dramatically decreased your own immune system by 35%.
[1:03:35.600 --> 1:03:37.680]  The first jab did it by at least 15.
[1:03:37.680 --> 1:03:40.360]  The second did it by 35 now.
[1:03:40.360 --> 1:03:43.360]  If you take any booster shot, you will die.
[1:03:43.360 --> 1:03:44.480]  That's it.
[1:03:44.480 --> 1:03:48.400]  You take a flu shot in the future, you will die.
[1:03:48.400 --> 1:03:53.720]  The second reason, antibody-dependent enhancement, antibody-dependent enhancement is what is
[1:03:53.720 --> 1:03:57.640]  happening with these jabs with everybody who has taken them, unless of course you've
[1:03:57.640 --> 1:04:01.320]  taken a placebo, but there's no way that you would know that.
[1:04:01.320 --> 1:04:06.360]  So given that fact, antibody-dependent enhancement tricks the entire body into believing that
[1:04:06.360 --> 1:04:09.880]  the cell that's eating the pathogen is eating it when it isn't.
[1:04:09.880 --> 1:04:16.040]  It ends up leading to what's called a cytokine storm, which causes organ failure.
[1:04:16.040 --> 1:04:18.840]  That will cause your death, and there's no stopping that.
[1:04:18.840 --> 1:04:20.840]  No amount of drugs will stop that.
[1:04:20.840 --> 1:04:24.000]  The third thing, blood clotting.
[1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:26.400]  Everyone who has taken the jabs is blood clotting.
[1:04:26.400 --> 1:04:29.440]  If you don't believe me, there's a way you can find out.
[1:04:29.440 --> 1:04:32.120]  Take what's called a de-dimer test.
[1:04:32.120 --> 1:04:37.680]  What that does is that it detects blood clotting at the microscopic level.
[1:04:37.680 --> 1:04:40.440]  They're cutting full blood clots out of people right now.
[1:04:40.440 --> 1:04:43.760]  As I'm talking to you, millions have died from the jabs.
[1:04:43.760 --> 1:04:50.000]  Good plan to create an injection that supposedly counters the virus that then makes your body
[1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:55.840]  produce new variants of it in mass, and by this winter, there's just going to be millions
[1:04:55.840 --> 1:05:00.000]  of dead, probably.
[1:05:00.000 --> 1:05:07.280]  The first time I heard the speech, the first time I read the writings of Teddy Roosevelt,
[1:05:07.280 --> 1:05:13.040]  I was in sixth grade, and we had this history teacher that had us write a paper on the man
[1:05:13.040 --> 1:05:16.960]  in the arena, and I just remember thinking about that and saying, I want to be the man
[1:05:16.960 --> 1:05:17.960]  in the arena.
[1:05:17.960 --> 1:05:21.640]  But when it comes to media, Info Wars has been the tip of that spear.
[1:05:21.640 --> 1:05:27.120]  But Mike Lindell has come along and done just as good a job as we've done, maybe even better
[1:05:27.120 --> 1:05:29.960]  when it comes to election fraud and other issues.

[1:06:19.480 --> 1:06:26.160]  And we are now into hour number two on this August 24th, Tuesday Transmission.
[1:06:26.160 --> 1:06:32.920]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, and I'm very, very blessed and honored to be here with you.
[1:06:32.920 --> 1:06:38.000]  Okay, let's tell you what's coming up this hour.
[1:06:38.000 --> 1:06:43.080]  We've got a lot of economic news, a lot of military news, a lot of medical news, a lot
[1:06:43.080 --> 1:06:48.160]  of police state news on the whole Homeland Security move to declare conservatives and
[1:06:48.160 --> 1:06:55.160]  Christians as the main terror threat, but I want to talk about the big lie of the vaccine
[1:06:55.160 --> 1:07:02.960]  mandates and that these are supposedly vaccines, and where all this is going if we don't stop
[1:07:02.960 --> 1:07:09.680]  it, and if we don't turn this around, because we're now sure, we're not just reading globalist
[1:07:09.680 --> 1:07:18.560]  documents like lockstep and Crimson Contagion and Spars and Event 201 and then saying, oh,
[1:07:18.560 --> 1:07:23.240]  they're saying they're going to do this, and then coming up with hypotheses of how it would
[1:07:23.240 --> 1:07:28.520]  roll out, which have been dead on, we're now almost two years into the takeover, and it's
[1:07:28.520 --> 1:07:33.600]  going exactly as our worst analysis said it would.
[1:07:33.600 --> 1:07:40.400]  And so that means that you better brace yourself and get ready for what is about to be unfolding
[1:07:40.400 --> 1:07:41.400]  and happening.
[1:07:41.400 --> 1:07:50.460]  And the big question is, how is the system going to spin the massive numbers of people
[1:07:50.460 --> 1:07:55.720]  dying of blood clots and autoimmune disorders and organ failure?
[1:07:55.720 --> 1:07:56.720]  How are they going to spend that?
[1:07:56.720 --> 1:07:57.720]  And it's quite easy.
[1:07:57.720 --> 1:08:05.320]  They're going to say that new variants of COVID-19 have done it.
[1:08:05.320 --> 1:08:08.800]  And so they've been planning this for a very long time, and they can say, oh, we've always
[1:08:08.800 --> 1:08:09.800]  had vaccine mandates.
[1:08:09.800 --> 1:08:16.320]  Yes, they've always, since the 30s, with eugenics mandates, injected poor people with
[1:08:16.320 --> 1:08:21.920]  all sorts of experimental shots that created huge scandals all over the world killing them.
[1:08:21.920 --> 1:08:26.720]  And Pfizer was the number one company in the world that's paid the most fines, had the
[1:08:26.720 --> 1:08:32.520]  most criminal charges for injecting people with experimental drugs and other things around
[1:08:32.520 --> 1:08:34.160]  the world and killing them.
[1:08:34.160 --> 1:08:41.960]  And that's in John Bowne's excellent report that he just put out today dealing with the
[1:08:41.960 --> 1:08:48.320]  huge global awakening that's happening, he's got a bunch of clips of crimes that Pfizer's
[1:08:48.320 --> 1:08:50.600]  committed.
[1:08:50.600 --> 1:08:55.320]  And did you know the lady they put at the head of the FDA to get all this emergency
[1:08:55.320 --> 1:09:01.200]  approval and now official approval, do you know that she's the lady that was in the agency
[1:09:01.200 --> 1:09:08.280]  before who approved OxyContin, which they proved was a plan to get millions addicted
[1:09:08.280 --> 1:09:13.240]  and kill millions that was even in the plan of the drug company to addict people, that's
[1:09:13.240 --> 1:09:14.400]  all on record.
[1:09:14.400 --> 1:09:20.400]  What could be worse than purposely authorizing because she was giving campaign money and
[1:09:20.400 --> 1:09:24.600]  the political parties she was involved in were, it was Democrats mainly, but Republicans
[1:09:24.600 --> 1:09:28.400]  were involved as well, Frank Luntz was the lobbyist.
[1:09:28.400 --> 1:09:34.760]  What could be worse, could she, the woman at the FDA who just approved all this to go after
[1:09:34.760 --> 1:09:42.720]  our children all of it, could she do something worse, the answer is, yes, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:09:42.720 --> 1:09:48.160]  and it's all in John Bowne's report, she did something even worse.
[1:09:48.160 --> 1:09:57.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, 20-something years ago, MIT developed a drug 50 to 100 times depending
[1:09:57.280 --> 1:10:02.200]  on the design of it, depending on the type.
[1:10:02.200 --> 1:10:09.920]  Longer than heroin, OxyContin is as strong as heroin.
[1:10:09.920 --> 1:10:14.800]  The woman that headed up the program at the FDA to authorize these franken shots, and
[1:10:14.800 --> 1:10:22.080]  now this authorization is the one that legalized the production of fentanyl, fentanyl.
[1:10:22.080 --> 1:10:27.200]  You think about that.
[1:10:27.200 --> 1:10:28.520]  So are these some killers?
[1:10:28.520 --> 1:10:32.400]  We're talking about some murderers here?
[1:10:32.400 --> 1:10:39.440]  Oh yeah, are they coming for us, you better bet they are, OxyContin, fentanyl, gene therapy
[1:10:39.440 --> 1:10:46.520]  injections that change yourselves, look this rendezvous here that we've been seeing getting
[1:10:46.520 --> 1:10:51.520]  pushed by Faucian people has less than 8% efficacy and it cost a bunch of money, they
[1:10:51.520 --> 1:10:55.360]  made money off that, didn't help people, but notice what they're not been promoting,
[1:10:55.360 --> 1:11:01.840]  no. Regeneron creates a bunch of clone white blood cells from mice, trains them to only
[1:11:01.840 --> 1:11:06.560]  kill COVID, puts them in you, they're all screens, what's not like from prisoners or
[1:11:06.560 --> 1:11:11.520]  something, they're blood, and it goes in with basically no side effects, cleans everything
[1:11:11.520 --> 1:11:12.520]  out.
[1:11:12.520 --> 1:11:16.920]  Now there might be stuff we don't know about long term, no short term stuff really, because
[1:11:16.920 --> 1:11:21.720]  it doesn't change your body, it sends something in that goes through and cleans it out and
[1:11:21.720 --> 1:11:29.720]  then you urinate it and defecate it out, you pass it through your body, through your gallbladder.
[1:11:29.720 --> 1:11:37.040]  But that company has liability, they've been around since the 80s, they've got a bunch
[1:11:37.040 --> 1:11:43.400]  of stuff that's improving work, they have patented antibodies that are 100% cure one
[1:11:43.400 --> 1:11:48.360]  form of skin cancer, and I wish them all the luck, I'm Mr. Buck Rogers, I'm Mr. George
[1:11:48.360 --> 1:11:54.040]  Jetson, maybe, I love technology, if it's vetted, if it doesn't have liability protection,
[1:11:54.040 --> 1:12:01.560]  and if it's transparent.
[1:12:01.560 --> 1:12:07.760]  And I'm glad that the governor of Texas has authorized for people that need it, free Regeneron,
[1:12:07.760 --> 1:12:12.080]  and the company's passed it on for no profit and is doing that.
[1:12:12.080 --> 1:12:19.080]  So see I'm all about real stuff, and are you rolling the dice when you take Regeneron,
[1:12:19.080 --> 1:12:24.720]  you might be, but does it go in and change your cells, nope, doesn't do anything to your
[1:12:24.720 --> 1:12:29.080]  cells, doesn't tell your cells what to do, doesn't take control of your cells, it sends
[1:12:29.080 --> 1:12:42.760]  cloned mice, white blood cells, who've been brought up in vats with COVID-19, and they
[1:12:42.760 --> 1:12:45.800]  know how to eat it, that's all they eat, they kill one thing.
[1:12:45.800 --> 1:12:49.800]  And I know now, four people that have taken it in Austin, who couldn't breathe or about
[1:12:49.800 --> 1:12:54.280]  to die, and it was just within four or five hours, they were just completely fine, just
[1:12:54.280 --> 1:12:59.720]  like Trump said, within four or five hours, a couple of them got a really bad headache,
[1:12:59.720 --> 1:13:04.320]  but that was it, and then it's gone like in a day.
[1:13:04.320 --> 1:13:07.880]  And I would imagine having a bunch of white blood cells crawling through your brain probably
[1:13:07.880 --> 1:13:12.480]  that aren't yours, probably doesn't feel too good, but we are at the Buck Rogers moment
[1:13:12.480 --> 1:13:18.360]  and see the globalists don't want us to have all the clean or cleaner transparent technology.
[1:13:18.360 --> 1:13:24.600]  They want out of big pharma and out of DARPA that set up Moderna and all this, no liability,
[1:13:24.600 --> 1:13:29.560]  total secrecy, no animal testing, no human testing, as they already secretly did it,
[1:13:29.560 --> 1:13:35.760]  to roll out something that isn't designed to help you like Regeneron, it's designed
[1:13:35.760 --> 1:13:40.120]  to hurt you, and that's what all the scientists who looked at it, they said, this will protect
[1:13:40.120 --> 1:13:46.120]  you, this will lower your immune system, this will create mutant viruses.
[1:13:46.120 --> 1:13:51.240]  And then it all comes out that the new Delta strain and all this is from the vaccinated
[1:13:51.240 --> 1:13:56.280]  and they had headlines all over the country and MSNBC and CNN and everything else going,
[1:13:56.280 --> 1:13:59.560]  look at what a dumbass Alex Jones is.
[1:13:59.560 --> 1:14:07.720]  Why, ha, he says the vaccine makes you become a mutant, he also said the frogs are gay from
[1:14:07.720 --> 1:14:08.720]  atrazine.
[1:14:08.720 --> 1:14:12.800]  No, I didn't say you become a mutant, though technically you do, just not in the science
[1:14:12.800 --> 1:14:18.400]  fiction version, we have like three heads or whatever, that'll just be your children,
[1:14:18.400 --> 1:14:22.240]  literally in the studies, in rats, massive deformities in their offspring if they're
[1:14:22.240 --> 1:14:24.280]  even able to have them.
[1:14:24.280 --> 1:14:34.120]  No, it's mutants in the cells, mutants in the sloughing, the shedding, this is the reality.
[1:14:34.120 --> 1:14:41.280]  So we put together a little compilation we'll cover when we come back with the Surgeon General
[1:14:41.280 --> 1:14:45.720]  saying natural immunity is no good, so I'm saying again, mother's milk's no good, cyanide's
[1:14:45.720 --> 1:14:51.080]  good for babies, but then in the next cut, oh, the vaccines don't work anymore, this
[1:14:51.080 --> 1:14:55.000]  is day to day, oh, it's the best thing ever, gold standard, you'll never need anything,
[1:14:55.000 --> 1:14:58.240]  but it doesn't work, they need more shots.
[1:14:58.240 --> 1:15:02.840]  And then Fauci saying the same thing, I mean, they act like we're morons and here's the
[1:15:02.840 --> 1:15:08.440]  deal, the average person's not really a moron, they're experts on their favorite TV show,
[1:15:08.440 --> 1:15:13.520]  their favorite video game, or how to go to work at their job done and go home and sit
[1:15:13.520 --> 1:15:17.160]  in front of the TV, and I used to be like that for a little while, I guess in high school,
[1:15:17.160 --> 1:15:21.440]  a little bit in college, not much, I mean, it's just, it's a dead feeling, but people
[1:15:21.440 --> 1:15:26.000]  do it, and as soon as you get into the real world, and as soon as you figure out how stuff
[1:15:26.000 --> 1:15:30.840]  works, it's not work to read documents, it's not work to research stuff, man, the more
[1:15:30.840 --> 1:15:36.960]  you learn, the more you want to know, and it just becomes totally addicting.
[1:15:36.960 --> 1:15:40.880]  And then you're 10 steps ahead of the globalist, I mean, if I wanted to, people like me that
[1:15:40.880 --> 1:15:45.320]  were awake wanted to take over, we could, my job is not to take over, because the globalist
[1:15:45.320 --> 1:15:48.480]  always say if you're resisting tyranny, you just want to be the elite, no, no, no, no,
[1:15:48.480 --> 1:15:51.520]  I don't want to replace the elite, I want to get rid of them and change the world for
[1:15:51.520 --> 1:15:55.760]  the better, I want a revolution of human empowerment, and I'm here to do it with you.

[1:17:59.960 --> 1:18:04.760]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone
[1:18:04.760 --> 1:18:07.480]  from beta testing to operational.
[1:18:07.480 --> 1:18:12.240]  The globalists are out on the open with their planetary depopulation takeover, their robot
[1:18:12.240 --> 1:18:13.240]  takeover.
[1:18:13.240 --> 1:18:16.640]  But the good news is we've been working and you've been working and others have been working
[1:18:16.640 --> 1:18:21.280]  across the planet for decades to get ready for this, to be able to find it off.
[1:18:21.280 --> 1:18:22.400]  Humanity is strong.
[1:18:22.400 --> 1:18:23.400]  We're incredible.
[1:18:23.400 --> 1:18:27.080]  And if we're aware of the attack that's happening, we have a real chance of defeating it.
[1:18:27.080 --> 1:18:29.560]  If we ask God for guidance, we will defeat it.
[1:18:29.560 --> 1:18:33.800]  So prayer is essential, research is essential, getting prepared is essential, and warning
[1:18:33.800 --> 1:18:35.520]  others is absolutely essential.
[1:18:35.520 --> 1:18:40.040]  And at the same time, supporting Info Wars by buying high-quality products to keep us

[1:20:22.560 --> 1:20:25.560]  InfoWars.
[1:20:25.560 --> 1:20:30.560]  Live flagship transmission, the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:30.560 --> 1:20:35.560]  And I am just so thankful to this crew.
[1:20:35.560 --> 1:20:36.560]  I love this crew.
[1:20:36.560 --> 1:20:38.560]  I'm so thankful to all of you out there.
[1:20:38.560 --> 1:20:39.560]  I love you.
[1:20:39.560 --> 1:20:41.560]  And we are all in this together.
[1:20:41.560 --> 1:20:42.560]  Okay.
[1:20:42.560 --> 1:20:46.560]  I'm going to get into the Globalist Big Plan and where they will be taking us if we don't
[1:20:46.560 --> 1:20:50.560]  resist and fight back, but the examples of fighting back all over the world that are
[1:20:50.560 --> 1:20:52.560]  turning the tide right now.
[1:20:52.560 --> 1:20:54.560]  So this is just an amazing time to be alive.
[1:20:54.560 --> 1:20:56.560]  This is the main enemy attack.
[1:20:56.560 --> 1:20:58.560]  It's their main move and it's a good thing.
[1:20:58.560 --> 1:21:00.560]  It's now out in the open.
[1:21:00.560 --> 1:21:03.560]  So we know what happens to tyrants every time they try this.
[1:21:03.560 --> 1:21:05.560]  It may take 10 years.
[1:21:05.560 --> 1:21:06.560]  It may take 50 years.
[1:21:06.560 --> 1:21:11.560]  It may take six months, but we're going to beat them and wake up and have a new
[1:21:11.560 --> 1:21:12.560]  start.
[1:21:12.560 --> 1:21:13.560]  Okay.
[1:21:13.560 --> 1:21:14.560]  So let's talk about criminal fraud.
[1:21:14.560 --> 1:21:16.560]  Let's talk about lies.
[1:21:16.560 --> 1:21:20.560]  The PCR test was the basis of all the false positives.
[1:21:20.560 --> 1:21:25.560]  94% at least was consciously set up by these people.
[1:21:25.560 --> 1:21:29.560]  They had a Theranos whistleblower that exposed their similar system as a fraud.
[1:21:29.560 --> 1:21:33.560]  They got smart when the inventor of PCR said they were using it fraudulently.
[1:21:33.560 --> 1:21:40.560]  They killed him right before they released the bio weapon in late 2019.
[1:21:40.560 --> 1:21:44.560]  And they lied about the Wuhan lab.
[1:21:44.560 --> 1:21:46.560]  They lied about treatments.
[1:21:46.560 --> 1:21:47.560]  They blocked treatments.
[1:21:47.560 --> 1:21:51.560]  They sent sick people to nursing homes because the virus wasn't spreading very
[1:21:51.560 --> 1:21:52.560]  good.
[1:21:52.560 --> 1:21:53.560]  It wasn't deadly virus.
[1:21:53.560 --> 1:21:57.560]  You were actually able to get it and didn't have enough vitamins or minerals.
[1:21:57.560 --> 1:22:00.560]  So now I believe they actually separately released some other spike protein stuff.
[1:22:00.560 --> 1:22:03.560]  I agree with Mike Adams, but we also have the studies and real scientists looking at
[1:22:03.560 --> 1:22:08.560]  it that after the inoculations began in England first, you suddenly see giant
[1:22:08.560 --> 1:22:10.560]  variants popping up.
[1:22:10.560 --> 1:22:14.560]  And the same thing here where, and that's what happens with viruses is they become
[1:22:14.560 --> 1:22:17.560]  more infectious but less lethal.
[1:22:17.560 --> 1:22:22.560]  And so the viral load of the Delta variant is a thousand times worse they're saying
[1:22:22.560 --> 1:22:23.560]  than that.
[1:22:23.560 --> 1:22:27.560]  And that's what I see is massive communicability just spreading everywhere.
[1:22:27.560 --> 1:22:32.560]  And the system hopping mad that folks are learning about ivermectin and learning
[1:22:32.560 --> 1:22:37.560]  about Regeneron and learning about all the other things that are out there like
[1:22:37.560 --> 1:22:43.560]  hydroxychloroquine thanks to all the great people like Dr. Zelinko and others that
[1:22:43.560 --> 1:22:44.560]  have been exposing it.
[1:22:44.560 --> 1:22:49.560]  So income criminal big pharma operatives that want to be part of the revolving door in
[1:22:49.560 --> 1:22:50.560]  government.
[1:22:50.560 --> 1:23:02.560]  This is Vivek Murthy, the puppet born in 1977, head of the so-called U.S. Medical Corps
[1:23:02.560 --> 1:23:08.560]  saying that your natural immunity is not as good as inoculation immunity from this
[1:23:08.560 --> 1:23:13.560]  gene therapy which lowers your immunity and supposedly just tricks your body to
[1:23:13.560 --> 1:23:17.560]  produce spike proteins so it recognizes it and blocks it but it said it just infects
[1:23:17.560 --> 1:23:18.560]  your whole body.
[1:23:18.560 --> 1:23:20.560]  And that's all the evidence.
[1:23:20.560 --> 1:23:25.560]  So here he is saying this is better immunity whereas a normal inoculation will give you
[1:23:25.560 --> 1:23:30.560]  some immunity but they admit maybe 10% of what natural is depending on what it is.
[1:23:30.560 --> 1:23:32.560]  I mean natural can last your whole life.
[1:23:32.560 --> 1:23:36.560]  They found people that were 90 years old who had gotten infected with the Spanish flu
[1:23:36.560 --> 1:23:41.560]  when they were 10 years old and they had still had total immunity to it.
[1:23:41.560 --> 1:23:49.560]  Okay so saying this is again like saying the football team in Dallas is not the Dallas
[1:23:49.560 --> 1:23:51.560]  Cowboys, it's the Dallas Horn Dogs.
[1:23:51.560 --> 1:23:54.560]  It's just not true but they say it.
[1:23:54.560 --> 1:23:56.560]  He's like yeah it's the Dallas Horn Dogs.
[1:23:56.560 --> 1:23:57.560]  You're like no it's the Cowboys.
[1:23:57.560 --> 1:23:59.560]  No it's not.
[1:23:59.560 --> 1:24:01.560]  It's our Superman wears a green cape.
[1:24:01.560 --> 1:24:02.560]  No he doesn't.
[1:24:02.560 --> 1:24:05.560]  I mean it's just or George Washington wasn't our first president.
[1:24:05.560 --> 1:24:10.560]  I mean the lie level and that's what all the medical doctors say and the epidemiology
[1:24:10.560 --> 1:24:12.560]  and virology and immunity.
[1:24:12.560 --> 1:24:13.560]  I mean this is a fact.
[1:24:13.560 --> 1:24:16.560]  It's just it's insane.
[1:24:16.560 --> 1:24:18.560]  It's insane.
[1:24:18.560 --> 1:24:20.560]  But that's what these criminals do.
[1:24:20.560 --> 1:24:21.560]  Remember they tried a few months ago.
[1:24:21.560 --> 1:24:24.560]  Oh 99% in the hospital didn't take the vaccine.
[1:24:24.560 --> 1:24:29.560]  It turned out it was actually worldwide 85% in the hospital that had the vaccine that
[1:24:29.560 --> 1:24:30.560]  were sick from COVID.
[1:24:30.560 --> 1:24:36.560]  So everything is upside down world and that he quote is countering misinformation.
[1:24:36.560 --> 1:24:40.560]  So here he is saying oh your natural immunity is not good.
[1:24:40.560 --> 1:24:42.560]  Then saying oh but the vaccine doesn't work.
[1:24:42.560 --> 1:24:44.560]  Oh really?
[1:24:44.560 --> 1:24:46.560]  And then I've got the articles right here.
[1:24:46.560 --> 1:24:50.560]  Pfizer shot just 39% effective now.
[1:24:50.560 --> 1:24:52.560]  That's Forbes.
[1:24:52.560 --> 1:24:54.560]  Here's Bloomberg.
[1:24:54.560 --> 1:24:58.560]  Vaccinated people may be more vulnerable to serious illnesses from COVID delta variant
[1:24:58.560 --> 1:25:01.560]  previously thought oh Bloomberg now you need the booster.
[1:25:01.560 --> 1:25:03.560]  See how it works?
[1:25:03.560 --> 1:25:06.560]  Because they got their new product for you.
[1:25:06.560 --> 1:25:09.560]  They're murdering logic because logic stands in their way.
[1:25:09.560 --> 1:25:10.560]  They're doing it on purpose.
[1:25:10.560 --> 1:25:12.560]  They're gaslighting you.
[1:25:12.560 --> 1:25:14.560]  So this guy's really a slimy little bastard.
[1:25:14.560 --> 1:25:16.560]  Here he is.
[1:25:16.560 --> 1:25:20.560]  We are seeing more and more data that tells us that while you get some protection from
[1:25:20.560 --> 1:25:25.560]  your natural infection it's not nearly as strong as what you get from the vaccine
[1:25:25.560 --> 1:25:29.560]  especially with the delta variant which is the hardiest and most contagious variant
[1:25:29.560 --> 1:25:30.560]  we've seen to date.
[1:25:30.560 --> 1:25:35.560]  It is now our clinical judgment that the time to lay out a plan for COVID-19
[1:25:35.560 --> 1:25:38.560]  boosters is now.
[1:25:38.560 --> 1:25:43.560]  Recent data makes clear that protection against mild and moderate disease has
[1:25:43.560 --> 1:25:45.560]  decreased over time.
[1:25:45.560 --> 1:25:50.560]  So what's the next step?
[1:25:50.560 --> 1:25:55.560]  The next step is to get you to both waning immunity and the strength of the widespread delta variant.
[1:25:55.560 --> 1:25:57.560]  Let's pause.
[1:25:57.560 --> 1:25:59.560]  Start the whole thing over and on.
[1:25:59.560 --> 1:26:02.560]  So he's saying your normal immunity is not as good.
[1:26:02.560 --> 1:26:04.560]  Oh but the vaccine doesn't work.
[1:26:04.560 --> 1:26:07.560]  He's wearing literally an admiral clown suit.
[1:26:07.560 --> 1:26:10.560]  Think about the level of the line.
[1:26:10.560 --> 1:26:13.560]  And he says now is the time to have the injection.
[1:26:13.560 --> 1:26:17.560]  We are seeing more and more data that tells us that while you get some protection from
[1:26:17.560 --> 1:26:22.560]  natural infection it's not nearly as strong as what you get from the vaccine especially
[1:26:22.560 --> 1:26:27.560]  with the delta variant which is the hardiest and most contagious variant we've seen to
[1:26:27.560 --> 1:26:29.560]  date.
[1:26:29.560 --> 1:26:33.560]  It is now our clinical judgment that the time to lay out a plan for COVID-19
[1:26:33.560 --> 1:26:35.560]  boosters is now.
[1:26:35.560 --> 1:26:39.560]  So we're seeing more and more data that tells us that while you get some protection from
[1:26:39.560 --> 1:26:45.040]  that the time to lay out a plan for COVID-19 boosters is now.
[1:26:45.040 --> 1:26:47.760]  Recent data makes clear that protection
[1:26:47.760 --> 1:26:51.840]  against mild and moderate disease has decreased over time.
[1:26:51.840 --> 1:26:55.080]  This is likely due to both waning immunity
[1:26:55.080 --> 1:26:58.720]  and the strength of the widespread delta variant.
[1:26:58.720 --> 1:27:02.120]  And Dr. Bottacheri, at the same time,
[1:27:02.120 --> 1:27:06.600]  natural immunity has essentially been kind of tossed
[1:27:06.600 --> 1:27:10.640]  aside by Dr. Fauci.
[1:27:10.640 --> 1:27:12.520]  And he's spoken about this directly.
[1:27:12.520 --> 1:27:14.720]  Watch.
[1:27:14.720 --> 1:27:18.440]  Vaccination in people previously infected significantly
[1:27:18.440 --> 1:27:20.120]  boosts the immune response.
[1:27:20.120 --> 1:27:24.600]  Vaccines, actually, at least with regard to SARS-CoV-2,
[1:27:24.600 --> 1:27:26.960]  can do better than nature.
[1:27:26.960 --> 1:27:29.160]  But take a look at the data out of Israel.
[1:27:29.160 --> 1:27:31.480]  Those who recovered from COVID-19
[1:27:31.480 --> 1:27:33.760]  may be better protected from reinfection
[1:27:33.760 --> 1:27:35.240]  than those who received the vaccine.
[1:27:35.240 --> 1:27:38.320]  Since May 1st, 72 people who previously had COVID
[1:27:38.320 --> 1:27:42.600]  were infected again, accounting for 1% of confirmed new cases,
[1:27:42.600 --> 1:27:47.120]  while 3,000 who were vaccinated have been infected.
[1:27:47.120 --> 1:27:50.200]  40% of confirmed new cases.
[1:27:50.200 --> 1:27:52.960]  Now, Dr. Bottacheri, to what?
[1:27:52.960 --> 1:27:54.440]  By the way, hit pause.
[1:27:54.440 --> 1:27:55.480]  That's super old numbers.
[1:27:55.480 --> 1:27:58.360]  Now it's over 85% of vaccinated in the hospital.
[1:27:58.360 --> 1:28:00.160]  Go back to her.
[1:28:00.160 --> 1:28:03.080]  I'm saying he's ignored the data on this.
[1:28:03.080 --> 1:28:05.000]  There was a fantastic study out of the Cleveland Clinic
[1:28:05.000 --> 1:28:05.920]  that found the same thing.
[1:28:05.920 --> 1:28:07.920]  That the people who had recovered from COVID
[1:28:07.920 --> 1:28:09.320]  were actually quite well protected
[1:28:09.320 --> 1:28:11.520]  against severe disease and reinfection.
[1:28:11.520 --> 1:28:13.280]  I don't understand why they've done that.
[1:28:13.280 --> 1:28:16.360]  It actually discriminates against all of the working class
[1:28:16.360 --> 1:28:18.080]  people who've come down with COVID,
[1:28:18.080 --> 1:28:20.480]  recovered from it, because we deemed them essential,
[1:28:20.480 --> 1:28:24.040]  didn't protect them, while protecting the laptop class.
[1:28:24.040 --> 1:28:26.560]  And now we say, OK, that natural media
[1:28:26.560 --> 1:28:27.760]  doesn't count for anything.
[1:28:27.760 --> 1:28:29.160]  You don't have the vaccine, so you
[1:28:29.160 --> 1:28:34.000]  can't go to a restaurant or a ball game or something.
[1:28:34.000 --> 1:28:35.160]  That's right, that's good.
[1:28:35.160 --> 1:28:36.760]  And here's the deal, guys.
[1:28:36.760 --> 1:28:39.720]  They're taking control of the normal human biological system
[1:28:39.720 --> 1:28:41.320]  and saying you don't have an immune system.
[1:28:41.320 --> 1:28:42.800]  Mothers can't give milk to babies.
[1:28:42.800 --> 1:28:45.640]  Women can't give birth vaginally.
[1:28:45.640 --> 1:28:47.120]  Your natural immunity doesn't work.
[1:28:47.120 --> 1:28:49.360]  We've got to put you in a bubble and control your life.
[1:28:49.360 --> 1:28:50.240]  Just stay in your bubble.
[1:28:50.240 --> 1:28:51.440]  Don't look at the sunset.
[1:28:51.440 --> 1:28:52.400]  Don't talk to your neighbors.
[1:28:52.400 --> 1:28:54.000]  I mean, this is really happening.
[1:28:54.000 --> 1:28:55.480]  This is the pod people.
[1:28:55.480 --> 1:28:57.240]  They're trying to make us the pod people.
[1:28:57.240 --> 1:28:58.160]  Wake up.
[1:28:58.160 --> 1:28:59.320]  Break your conditioning.
[1:28:59.320 --> 1:29:02.160]  OK.
[1:29:02.160 --> 1:29:04.920]  Have you ever thought about turning your Glock, XD family,

[1:30:05.200 --> 1:30:07.920]  I've tried Turboforce with everything.
[1:30:07.920 --> 1:30:09.640]  Sometimes, you know, I went a little bit crazy.
[1:30:09.640 --> 1:30:11.320]  I put Turboforce in my coffee.
[1:30:11.320 --> 1:30:12.280]  That was a crazy week.
[1:30:12.280 --> 1:30:14.760]  I don't remember sleeping, but as far as the products go,
[1:30:14.760 --> 1:30:17.120]  Turboforce is my favorite, and all the Infowars products

[1:30:21.960 --> 1:30:23.920]  to do it for you.
[1:30:23.920 --> 1:30:27.160]  Nobody wakes up in the morning and thinks,
[1:30:27.160 --> 1:30:29.120]  I'm going to give that person over there a better life.
[1:30:29.120 --> 1:30:29.960]  I'm going to wake up today.
[1:30:29.960 --> 1:30:30.520]  You know what?
[1:30:30.520 --> 1:30:32.320]  I'm going to spend my entire day trying
[1:30:32.320 --> 1:30:34.800]  to make that guy over there healthier, happier, and richer.
[1:30:34.800 --> 1:30:37.120]  I'm going to make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend.
[1:30:37.120 --> 1:30:38.520]  I don't think that happens very often.
[1:30:38.520 --> 1:30:39.360]  It's never happened to me.
[1:30:39.360 --> 1:30:41.040]  I've never had anyone knock on my door and said,
[1:30:41.040 --> 1:30:42.240]  Tate, you're such a good guy.
[1:30:42.240 --> 1:30:44.080]  How can I improve your life in every single way?
[1:30:44.080 --> 1:30:46.040]  There's only one person who woke up and thought that,
[1:30:46.040 --> 1:30:46.800]  and that was me.
[1:30:46.800 --> 1:30:48.080]  I woke up and thought, you know what?
[1:30:48.080 --> 1:30:49.760]  OK, I want to take control of my life.
[1:30:49.760 --> 1:30:50.960]  I want to take control of my health,

[1:32:05.120 --> 1:32:07.080]  Many of them have fillers and additives.
[1:32:07.080 --> 1:32:08.960]  Many of them just pass right through the body
[1:32:08.960 --> 1:32:10.120]  and are not absorbed.
[1:32:10.120 --> 1:32:13.160]  But that's not the case with our incredibly popular,
[1:32:13.160 --> 1:32:15.520]  because it's so effective product that has now
[1:32:15.520 --> 1:32:18.960]  been sold out for months, but it's finally back and started.
[1:32:18.960 --> 1:32:21.360]  And that is vitamin and mineral fusion.
[1:32:21.360 --> 1:32:24.480]  All the essential vitamins, all the essential minerals,
[1:32:24.480 --> 1:32:27.080]  a bunch of key amino acids to help it upload better
[1:32:27.080 --> 1:32:28.560]  into your body and your cells.
[1:32:28.560 --> 1:32:29.880]  It's a powder form.
[1:32:29.880 --> 1:32:30.760]  It's great for children.
[1:32:30.760 --> 1:32:31.680]  It's great for adults.
[1:32:31.680 --> 1:32:34.200]  It's really important for folks that are older,
[1:32:34.200 --> 1:32:36.200]  because they don't absorb as well through their guts.
[1:32:36.200 --> 1:32:38.720]  So this liquid formula really, really does it.
[1:32:38.720 --> 1:32:41.080]  You mix up a picture of it every couple of days,
[1:32:41.080 --> 1:32:43.960]  put it in the refrigerator, or keep it out in the kitchen,
[1:32:43.960 --> 1:32:46.360]  and just remember to drink it in the morning and in the evening.
[1:32:46.360 --> 1:32:47.400]  It tastes great.
[1:32:47.400 --> 1:32:48.680]  It makes your body healthy.
[1:32:48.680 --> 1:32:50.280]  It boosts your immune system.
[1:32:50.280 --> 1:32:52.520]  And it funds the info war.
[1:32:52.520 --> 1:32:54.120]  A true 360 win.
[1:32:54.120 --> 1:32:56.360]  So vitamin and mineral fusion sold out for months
[1:32:56.360 --> 1:32:58.040]  is back in stock for a limited time,
[1:32:58.040 --> 1:32:59.760]  33% off infowarstore.com.
[1:33:02.520 --> 1:33:05.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:05.360 --> 1:33:19.120]  The year is 1995, and info wars launches the last of America's
[1:33:19.120 --> 1:33:21.160]  counter-globalist probes.
[1:33:21.160 --> 1:33:25.160]  In a freak mishap, infowars.com and Alex Jones
[1:33:25.160 --> 1:33:27.240]  are blown out of their trajectory
[1:33:27.240 --> 1:33:31.080]  into an orbit which freezes his life support systems
[1:33:31.080 --> 1:33:35.720]  and returns Alex Jones to Earth 25 years later.
[1:33:35.720 --> 1:33:38.360]  Transdimensionally, over the spacetime continuum,
[1:33:38.360 --> 1:33:39.560]  they're full space.
[1:33:39.560 --> 1:33:42.840]  Where people are extremely lazy, the social engineers
[1:33:42.840 --> 1:33:43.880]  are there laughing.
[1:33:43.880 --> 1:33:47.080]  What we envisioned 100 years ago, 20 years ago,
[1:33:47.080 --> 1:33:48.680]  is now reality.
[1:33:48.680 --> 1:33:52.080]  While the society unravels, men run around totally frantic,
[1:33:52.080 --> 1:33:54.480]  not knowing how to be men, and women run around frantic,
[1:33:54.480 --> 1:33:55.400]  not knowing how to be women.
[1:33:55.400 --> 1:33:57.400]  And they don't understand that it's
[1:33:57.400 --> 1:34:00.200]  an animating contest of life and that it's
[1:34:00.200 --> 1:34:01.920]  fulfilling to be informed.
[1:34:01.920 --> 1:34:03.920]  It's fulfilling to be involved.
[1:34:03.920 --> 1:34:04.920]  It's fulfilling.
[1:34:04.920 --> 1:34:07.760]  Infowars, tomorrow's news today.
[1:34:15.280 --> 1:34:18.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:34:18.360 --> 1:34:32.360]  This is it, man, toe-to-toe with the globalist.
[1:34:32.360 --> 1:34:37.360]  We're not waiting for the new world order anymore.
[1:34:37.360 --> 1:34:40.360]  We have now entered Mordor.
[1:34:40.360 --> 1:34:46.360]  And the globalists think they're going to trick us.
[1:34:46.360 --> 1:34:49.840]  They think they can get people to sign on to be left alone.
[1:34:49.840 --> 1:34:51.600]  And if you just give them a little freedom,
[1:34:51.600 --> 1:34:55.280]  the system will leave you alone.
[1:34:55.280 --> 1:34:57.160]  But every time you give up freedom,
[1:34:57.160 --> 1:34:58.240]  they demand even more.
[1:34:58.240 --> 1:35:00.840]  Look at how they told them, take the injections.
[1:35:00.840 --> 1:35:02.160]  And then you cannot wear the mask.
[1:35:02.160 --> 1:35:03.280]  You can go wherever you want.
[1:35:03.280 --> 1:35:05.360]  Oh, sorry, got to still wear the mask.
[1:35:05.360 --> 1:35:07.600]  Got to take more shots.
[1:35:07.600 --> 1:35:09.160]  Oh, and you're really sick now.
[1:35:09.160 --> 1:35:11.480]  Oh, the Delta variant's going to get you.
[1:35:11.480 --> 1:35:14.680]  You're sick from the vaccine, because it's not a vaccine.
[1:35:14.680 --> 1:35:16.680]  It's growing prion crystals.
[1:35:16.680 --> 1:35:20.080]  You're diseaseing others now.
[1:35:20.080 --> 1:35:22.920]  It's all a well-laid-out plan.
[1:35:26.200 --> 1:35:28.840]  And I could talk about answers on the way to resist this.
[1:35:28.840 --> 1:35:30.400]  And I'll do that next segment.
[1:35:30.400 --> 1:35:32.480]  But I want, at the time, we have left in this segment
[1:35:32.480 --> 1:35:37.480]  to get into currently the trajectory we're on.
[1:35:37.480 --> 1:35:40.320]  And again, I want to be extremely clear about this.
[1:35:40.320 --> 1:35:42.440]  We had all the white papers, the globalist plans,
[1:35:42.440 --> 1:35:44.320]  beta tests they'd done before.
[1:35:44.320 --> 1:35:45.760]  We were able to predict what they were
[1:35:45.760 --> 1:35:47.120]  going to do very accurately.
[1:35:47.120 --> 1:35:52.040]  But they had a couple of different battle
[1:35:52.040 --> 1:35:53.400]  plans going in the same direction.
[1:35:53.400 --> 1:35:56.600]  And I personally, because they hadn't been moving too fast
[1:35:56.600 --> 1:36:02.040]  before, thought they would do a placebo vaccine
[1:36:02.040 --> 1:36:06.880]  and that they wouldn't start the real calling till later.
[1:36:06.880 --> 1:36:09.800]  But because they're so far behind,
[1:36:09.800 --> 1:36:12.800]  and I said this is the other possible path last year,
[1:36:12.800 --> 1:36:14.720]  is that this will make you really sick
[1:36:14.720 --> 1:36:16.240]  like all the scientists are saying.
[1:36:16.240 --> 1:36:17.280]  I just had trouble believing it.
[1:36:17.280 --> 1:36:17.960]  I was so shocking.
[1:36:21.280 --> 1:36:23.840]  That then they will say the unvaccinated
[1:36:23.840 --> 1:36:26.760]  are the reason that all the vaccinated are dying.
[1:36:26.760 --> 1:36:30.840]  And so they went with that plan.
[1:36:30.840 --> 1:36:32.880]  They had several others.
[1:36:32.880 --> 1:36:42.040]  And so a lot of this is because the top Rothschilds have died,
[1:36:42.040 --> 1:36:44.680]  the top Rockefellers have died.
[1:36:44.680 --> 1:36:48.960]  And I know a lot of people that know the top people.
[1:36:48.960 --> 1:36:52.160]  And I mean, they are just involved in torturing and murdering
[1:36:52.160 --> 1:36:55.440]  people and devil worshiping and eating vats of feces
[1:36:55.440 --> 1:37:00.480]  and chopping their genitals off and torturing themselves.
[1:37:00.480 --> 1:37:01.600]  I'm not joking around, OK?
[1:37:01.600 --> 1:37:02.440]  This is not a joke.
[1:37:02.440 --> 1:37:04.200]  I'm not just saying this for shock value.
[1:37:04.200 --> 1:37:06.000]  I think people have learned that by now.
[1:37:06.000 --> 1:37:08.840]  I told you all over the world, psychologists and psychiatrists
[1:37:08.840 --> 1:37:12.200]  at CP has placed children with pedophiles in rape rooms
[1:37:12.200 --> 1:37:12.720]  worldwide.
[1:37:12.720 --> 1:37:14.680]  Now it's all over the news, OK?
[1:37:14.680 --> 1:37:17.360]  We're not making this up.
[1:37:17.360 --> 1:37:24.720]  In fact, I ran into some stuff last night doing research,
[1:37:24.720 --> 1:37:26.560]  which I already knew they were up to.
[1:37:26.560 --> 1:37:27.920]  But it's just it's so horrible.
[1:37:27.920 --> 1:37:32.200]  God, sorry.
[1:37:32.200 --> 1:37:34.320]  Look, believe me, if you think I've gone there
[1:37:34.320 --> 1:37:36.720]  on how bad these guys are, you have no idea.
[1:37:36.720 --> 1:37:43.040]  So whether it's the Duponts or whether it's the Rockefellers
[1:37:43.040 --> 1:37:49.200]  or whether it is the Vanderbilt's,
[1:37:49.200 --> 1:37:55.240]  they are genetically completely turned over to hurting life.
[1:37:55.240 --> 1:37:58.560]  When you see Anderson Cooper, you have to understand,
[1:37:58.560 --> 1:38:01.920]  he looks like a wraith since he was 20 for a reason.
[1:38:01.920 --> 1:38:05.400]  His full will is compromised by the dark side.
[1:38:05.400 --> 1:38:10.280]  And he has one thing, hurt people, hurt innocents,
[1:38:10.280 --> 1:38:15.400]  suck energy, destroy, just like Bill Gates.
[1:38:15.400 --> 1:38:18.880]  And I'm digressing, though.
[1:38:18.880 --> 1:38:20.680]  See, I start looking into their minds
[1:38:20.680 --> 1:38:23.720]  and go down that rabbit trail.
[1:38:23.720 --> 1:38:27.240]  But these are predators from hell.
[1:38:27.240 --> 1:38:30.280]  Imagine them as like tentacles reaching in from another dimension,
[1:38:30.280 --> 1:38:32.440]  trying to drag you in with them.
[1:38:32.440 --> 1:38:34.760]  That's it.
[1:38:34.760 --> 1:38:38.840]  And so, when you understand that,
[1:38:38.840 --> 1:38:41.800]  you understand that everything they are is betrayal.
[1:38:41.800 --> 1:38:43.760]  Everything they are is lies.
[1:38:43.760 --> 1:38:46.480]  Everything they are is inversion,
[1:38:46.480 --> 1:38:48.480]  because that is their God.
[1:38:48.480 --> 1:38:52.280]  They have purified themselves.
[1:38:52.280 --> 1:38:59.120]  They have sanctified themselves in their satanic religion.
[1:38:59.120 --> 1:39:00.800]  And I'm glad the public's getting this.
[1:39:00.800 --> 1:39:03.680]  You know, last night, Tucker Carlson came out and said,
[1:39:03.680 --> 1:39:11.600]  you know, the operating system of Democrats really is Satanism.
[1:39:11.600 --> 1:39:13.600]  And he got a lot of criticism for that.
[1:39:13.600 --> 1:39:15.600]  But actually, next segment, I'll hit that.
[1:39:15.600 --> 1:39:16.840]  That's important.
[1:39:16.840 --> 1:39:19.960]  But they had a movie came out a few years ago and saw it.
[1:39:19.960 --> 1:39:21.640]  That was the Almodraptaus in Austin,
[1:39:21.640 --> 1:39:24.200]  a movie theater packed with the liberals celebrating,
[1:39:24.200 --> 1:39:25.680]  saying, hell, Satan, you name it.
[1:39:25.680 --> 1:39:27.680]  And the whole shows of the Democratic Party
[1:39:27.680 --> 1:39:29.440]  sees Republicans as Christians,
[1:39:29.440 --> 1:39:32.040]  so they've adopted Satanism as their religion.
[1:39:32.040 --> 1:39:33.880]  And they go, oh, we don't really believe in Satan.
[1:39:33.880 --> 1:39:35.600]  Just get involved in our group.
[1:39:35.600 --> 1:39:37.320]  But then it gets deeper into the movie,
[1:39:37.320 --> 1:39:38.600]  and they really are Satanist.
[1:39:41.760 --> 1:39:47.400]  And so, that's what this whole thing is.
[1:39:47.400 --> 1:39:50.640]  And it's not a game.
[1:39:50.640 --> 1:39:56.360]  And once you turn yourself over to it, it takes you over.
[1:39:56.360 --> 1:39:59.720]  Now, you can use the analogy of a ring-raith stabbing you
[1:39:59.720 --> 1:40:02.320]  with its poison blade and tip breaks off.
[1:40:02.320 --> 1:40:03.840]  And if you don't get that tip out of you,
[1:40:03.840 --> 1:40:05.880]  it's going to take you over.
[1:40:05.880 --> 1:40:06.680]  It's going to kill you.
[1:40:06.680 --> 1:40:08.200]  It's going to take your soul.
[1:40:08.200 --> 1:40:10.040]  And this is all about taking your will.
[1:40:10.040 --> 1:40:11.840]  Because you may not respect yourself.
[1:40:11.840 --> 1:40:13.720]  You may not think you're an amazing creature.
[1:40:13.720 --> 1:40:15.560]  You may not think you're an incredible artist.
[1:40:15.560 --> 1:40:17.680]  You may not think your soul's beautiful.
[1:40:17.680 --> 1:40:18.680]  God made you.
[1:40:18.680 --> 1:40:20.920]  God thinks you're incredible.
[1:40:20.920 --> 1:40:22.840]  And you're quite a prize.
[1:40:22.840 --> 1:40:25.600]  The fact that you can see the beauty of a sunset.
[1:40:25.600 --> 1:40:28.800]  My mother, I told this story 20 years ago.
[1:40:28.800 --> 1:40:30.480]  I told it again just last year.
[1:40:30.480 --> 1:40:35.200]  My mother said, you look at the sunset.
[1:40:35.200 --> 1:40:37.640]  And you look at the water and the waves and the beach.
[1:40:37.640 --> 1:40:39.200]  And you know it's beautiful.
[1:40:39.200 --> 1:40:40.320]  And you know it's good.
[1:40:40.320 --> 1:40:41.280]  And you commune with it.
[1:40:41.280 --> 1:40:45.040]  And you spiritually connect through God's creation to God.
[1:40:45.040 --> 1:40:48.360]  And that is a form of worship, electromagnetically
[1:40:48.360 --> 1:40:50.600]  and spiritually to God.
[1:40:50.600 --> 1:40:55.240]  And God made us to experience this with him.
[1:40:55.240 --> 1:40:56.640]  And what do they come out and say?
[1:40:56.640 --> 1:40:59.120]  In Canada, in Australia, New Zealand,
[1:40:59.120 --> 1:41:01.720]  do not look at the sunset.
[1:41:04.440 --> 1:41:08.080]  Well, statistically, if you look in the morning and at night
[1:41:08.080 --> 1:41:10.800]  when it's low on the horizon, so it's not bad for your eyes,
[1:41:10.800 --> 1:41:15.360]  it's been known to massively boost your IQ long term
[1:41:15.360 --> 1:41:16.880]  to cure depression.
[1:41:16.880 --> 1:41:18.960]  You name it.
[1:41:18.960 --> 1:41:20.120]  Sun gazing.
[1:41:20.120 --> 1:41:23.040]  The media makes you don't look at it once it's up high at all.
[1:41:23.040 --> 1:41:25.520]  But come out right when it's on the horizon.
[1:41:25.520 --> 1:41:27.120]  It's through the filter of the dust.
[1:41:27.120 --> 1:41:30.760]  That light just does something in your brain.
[1:41:30.760 --> 1:41:32.480]  And it's all these things God gave us
[1:41:32.480 --> 1:41:35.880]  they're trying to take away because these are Satanists.
[1:41:35.880 --> 1:41:40.280]  Do you think these Satanists go at dawn and dusk
[1:41:40.280 --> 1:41:41.280]  and stare at the sun?
[1:41:41.280 --> 1:41:43.200]  No, they don't.
[1:41:43.200 --> 1:41:46.360]  You think they like what God put up there?
[1:41:46.360 --> 1:41:48.120]  We don't worship the sun.
[1:41:48.120 --> 1:41:51.920]  It gives us all the life God gave it to us.
[1:41:51.920 --> 1:41:53.960]  And it is an archetype of God.
[1:41:53.960 --> 1:41:56.200]  An archetype of his son.
[1:41:56.200 --> 1:41:58.120]  The ancients do this, the Egyptians do it.
[1:41:58.120 --> 1:42:00.480]  S-U-N-S-O-N.
[1:42:04.840 --> 1:42:08.160]  So, ladies and gentlemen, it's just that simple.
[1:42:08.160 --> 1:42:10.760]  All the studies show you go out with barefoot on the grass
[1:42:10.760 --> 1:42:12.880]  or you walk through the woods for just 10 minutes,
[1:42:12.880 --> 1:42:15.240]  impressions going and everything the enemy does
[1:42:15.240 --> 1:42:20.000]  is to take us out of that and take us away.
[1:42:20.000 --> 1:42:22.240]  That's the perfect way to look at the sun right there.
[1:42:22.240 --> 1:42:24.000]  That's what I do whenever I have the time.
[1:42:24.000 --> 1:42:26.280]  Anytime I'm upset or tired or really shook up,
[1:42:26.280 --> 1:42:29.040]  make sure I get up early, go out.
[1:42:29.040 --> 1:42:31.080]  There's a green belt behind my house
[1:42:31.080 --> 1:42:32.480]  and I mean 10 minutes in the sun.
[1:42:32.480 --> 1:42:35.960]  Oh my God, I am just totally connected to God.
[1:42:35.960 --> 1:42:37.080]  You want to have a vision?
[1:42:37.080 --> 1:42:39.080]  Go do it.
[1:42:39.080 --> 1:42:40.880]  Because you're designed to do that.
[1:42:40.880 --> 1:42:42.760]  That's what all the other animals do when it comes up.
[1:42:42.760 --> 1:42:45.440]  They all come out and sit under it and look at it.
[1:42:45.440 --> 1:42:46.920]  They all celebrate it.
[1:42:46.920 --> 1:42:48.280]  We're all together.
[1:42:48.280 --> 1:42:50.200]  We're all connected to the whole universe of God games.
[1:42:50.200 --> 1:42:51.640]  We are with God.
[1:42:51.640 --> 1:42:53.560]  And the enemy will never take that away from us.
[1:42:53.560 --> 1:42:55.440]  You murderers, you criminal scum,
[1:42:55.440 --> 1:42:58.880]  and you will pay for what you've done to our children.
[1:42:58.880 --> 1:43:00.480]  Gerald of South Carolina,
[1:43:00.480 --> 1:43:02.000]  go ahead, you're on the air, trying to move quicker.
[1:43:02.000 --> 1:43:03.240]  Hey Alex, welcome.
[1:43:03.240 --> 1:43:04.720]  Would like to say first off,
[1:43:04.720 --> 1:43:06.600]  thanks for being the voice of reason
[1:43:06.600 --> 1:43:08.400]  and amongst all this stupidity.
[1:43:08.400 --> 1:43:09.400]  Wanted to warn people,
[1:43:09.400 --> 1:43:11.760]  I've been trying to get ahold of you for a year, okay?
[1:43:11.760 --> 1:43:13.200]  I'm a double amputee
[1:43:13.200 --> 1:43:16.800]  and I have bacteria infection on my lung
[1:43:16.800 --> 1:43:18.200]  that'll never go away.
[1:43:18.200 --> 1:43:19.880]  Living defense saved my life.
[1:43:19.880 --> 1:43:22.840]  They had me on antibiotics for two years
[1:43:22.840 --> 1:43:24.000]  that almost killed me.
[1:43:24.000 --> 1:43:25.720]  Living defense brought me back.
[1:43:25.720 --> 1:43:28.320]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible,
[1:43:28.320 --> 1:43:31.320]  Jesus is saying as to where we are right now.
[1:43:31.320 --> 1:43:33.720]  This is Matthew 24, verse nine.
[1:43:33.720 --> 1:43:37.400]  Then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted
[1:43:37.400 --> 1:43:38.960]  and shall kill you.
[1:43:38.960 --> 1:43:42.960]  And ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.
[1:43:42.960 --> 1:43:45.200]  And then shall many be offended
[1:43:45.200 --> 1:43:46.840]  and shall betray one another
[1:43:46.840 --> 1:43:48.520]  and shall hate one another.
[1:43:48.520 --> 1:43:50.160]  That's right where we're at, brother.
[1:43:50.160 --> 1:43:52.080]  And that's because God's name
[1:43:52.080 --> 1:43:53.320]  is on the founding of this country,
[1:43:53.320 --> 1:43:54.600]  no matter what they say.
[1:43:54.600 --> 1:43:55.920]  And that's why the enemy hates it
[1:43:55.920 --> 1:43:57.880]  because God created this country.
[1:43:59.320 --> 1:44:01.760]  So when I first started taking survival shield,
[1:44:01.760 --> 1:44:04.280]  basically I was 275 pounds, I was overweight.
[1:44:04.280 --> 1:44:06.640]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe.
[1:44:06.640 --> 1:44:08.520]  I was barely holding onto a jaw
[1:44:08.520 --> 1:44:11.120]  and I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it.
[1:44:11.120 --> 1:44:13.720]  So the first one I got was the original survival shield,
[1:44:13.720 --> 1:44:14.560]  the X1.
[1:44:14.560 --> 1:44:15.600]  And it worked pretty good.
[1:44:15.600 --> 1:44:17.920]  And then shortly thereafter you came out with that too.
[1:44:17.920 --> 1:44:19.840]  You had, you know, with a deep-burdened source, you know,
[1:44:19.840 --> 1:44:21.680]  and I got really excited about that so I took it.
[1:44:21.680 --> 1:44:24.840]  And then in two weeks, I went from brain fog
[1:44:24.840 --> 1:44:28.040]  to like literally like my brain was enlightened.
[1:44:28.040 --> 1:44:29.440]  You know, I could think again,
[1:44:29.440 --> 1:44:31.240]  I could connect with people again.
[1:44:31.240 --> 1:44:34.040]  And over the course of the next couple of years,
[1:44:34.040 --> 1:44:36.240]  I got my health back and I religiously take
[1:44:36.240 --> 1:44:37.680]  basically all of your supplements.
[1:44:37.680 --> 1:44:40.080]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[1:44:40.080 --> 1:44:42.600]  The one I like recently is knockout literally.
[1:44:42.600 --> 1:44:44.120]  Like if you wanna sleep, just take it.
[1:44:44.120 --> 1:44:45.400]  It's amazing, it works.
[1:44:45.400 --> 1:44:46.640]  But anyway, so the point is
[1:44:46.640 --> 1:44:48.040]  we have to get ourselves clean.
[1:44:48.040 --> 1:44:50.480]  We have to break free of the globalist system.
[1:44:50.480 --> 1:44:53.040]  And the only way to do that is to take our own health
[1:44:53.040 --> 1:44:54.120]  into our own hands.
[1:44:54.120 --> 1:44:55.320]  Beautifully said, brother.
[1:44:55.320 --> 1:44:57.720]  I thank you so much for your call and Godspeed.
[1:45:00.480 --> 1:45:03.720]  Let's go back in time, say, to the mid-1990s.
[1:45:03.720 --> 1:45:05.600]  And then imagine a science fiction movie
[1:45:05.600 --> 1:45:07.440]  set in the year 2020,
[1:45:07.440 --> 1:45:09.160]  where a world government's being established,
[1:45:09.160 --> 1:45:11.880]  where members of Congress and former presidents
[1:45:11.880 --> 1:45:13.400]  are censured by big tech.
[1:45:13.400 --> 1:45:16.600]  And where if you don't take an experimental injection
[1:45:16.600 --> 1:45:20.480]  that grows blood plots and prions all over your body,
[1:45:20.480 --> 1:45:24.200]  then you're not allowed to fly on an airplane.
[1:45:24.200 --> 1:45:26.440]  Think about that, because that's where we are.
[1:45:26.440 --> 1:45:29.960]  Imagine just 20, 30 years ago, tell us just five years ago,
[1:45:29.960 --> 1:45:33.280]  if somebody told you this would be happening.
[1:45:33.280 --> 1:45:35.320]  But it is happening now.
[1:45:35.320 --> 1:45:36.760]  And then they tell you, oh, sorry,
[1:45:36.760 --> 1:45:38.480]  it's not a vaccine, it's a gene therapy,
[1:45:38.480 --> 1:45:39.920]  and it doesn't really work.
[1:45:39.920 --> 1:45:41.880]  So you gotta take it every few months.
[1:45:41.880 --> 1:45:44.400]  And the people that have submitted say, great,
[1:45:44.400 --> 1:45:45.720]  I want to take it all the time
[1:45:45.720 --> 1:45:48.120]  so I can go outside and not get sick from COVID,
[1:45:48.120 --> 1:45:49.880]  even though it gets you sick from COVID.
[1:45:49.880 --> 1:45:52.120]  And now there's record numbers of really sick people
[1:45:52.120 --> 1:45:54.800]  from the sloughing, the shedding of the virus.
[1:45:54.800 --> 1:45:56.600]  And that's in mainline studies.
[1:45:56.600 --> 1:45:58.320]  Bill Gates and Fauci did this.
[1:45:58.320 --> 1:46:00.600]  Need to go to prison for it right now.
[1:46:00.600 --> 1:46:04.360]  Not all vitamin and mineral supplements are equal.
[1:46:04.360 --> 1:46:05.440]  Many of them are synthetic.
[1:46:05.440 --> 1:46:07.360]  Many of them have fillers and additives.
[1:46:07.360 --> 1:46:09.280]  Many of them just pass right through the body
[1:46:09.280 --> 1:46:10.440]  and are not absorbed.
[1:46:10.440 --> 1:46:13.480]  Well, that's not the case with our incredibly popular,
[1:46:13.480 --> 1:46:15.480]  because it's so effective product
[1:46:15.480 --> 1:46:17.120]  that it's now been sold out for months,
[1:46:17.120 --> 1:46:19.320]  but it's finally back in stone.
[1:46:19.320 --> 1:46:21.680]  And that is vitamin, mineral fusion.
[1:46:21.680 --> 1:46:24.800]  All the essential vitamins, all the essential minerals,
[1:46:24.800 --> 1:46:27.080]  a bunch of key amino acids to help it upload
[1:46:27.080 --> 1:46:28.880]  better into your body and your cells.
[1:46:28.880 --> 1:46:31.080]  It's in powder form, it's great for children,
[1:46:31.080 --> 1:46:33.160]  it's great for adults, it's really important
[1:46:33.160 --> 1:46:34.520]  for folks that are older,
[1:46:34.520 --> 1:46:36.560]  because they don't absorb as well through their guts.
[1:46:36.560 --> 1:46:39.080]  So this liquid formula really, really does.
[1:46:39.080 --> 1:46:41.440]  You mix up a picture of it every couple of days,
[1:46:41.440 --> 1:46:44.360]  put it in the refrigerator, keep it out in the kitchen,
[1:46:44.360 --> 1:46:45.720]  and just remember to drink it in the morning
[1:46:45.720 --> 1:46:47.800]  and in the evening, it tastes great,
[1:46:47.800 --> 1:46:50.640]  it makes your body healthy, it boosts your immune system,
[1:46:50.640 --> 1:46:52.920]  and it funds the end for war.
[1:46:52.920 --> 1:46:55.880]  A true 360 win, so vitamin, mineral fusion,
[1:46:55.880 --> 1:46:58.440]  sold out for months, it's back in stock for a limited time,
[1:46:58.440 --> 1:47:00.280]  33% off at FullWareStore.com.
[1:47:00.280 --> 1:47:06.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:47:25.360 --> 1:47:27.720]  You know, I want to do a human ritual with our listeners.
[1:47:27.720 --> 1:47:29.760]  I just thought of the stir in the break.
[1:47:29.760 --> 1:47:31.920]  I'll talk about it at the end of the show today.
[1:47:31.920 --> 1:47:35.480]  But I want everybody to pledge tonight
[1:47:35.480 --> 1:47:37.200]  and tomorrow night and the next night,
[1:47:37.200 --> 1:47:38.360]  because depending on where you are,
[1:47:38.360 --> 1:47:41.240]  the sun may not be clear in the sky,
[1:47:41.240 --> 1:47:45.760]  to only for like five minutes, right as it's setting,
[1:47:45.760 --> 1:47:48.520]  you know, the safe time to do it,
[1:47:48.520 --> 1:47:53.280]  to join me in gazing at God's incredible creation
[1:47:53.280 --> 1:47:55.720]  that gives us life and a celebration of life
[1:47:55.720 --> 1:47:57.520]  and to thank God.
[1:47:57.520 --> 1:48:00.080]  And the media will spit it and say it's an occult ritual
[1:48:00.080 --> 1:48:01.840]  because that's the opposite.
[1:48:01.840 --> 1:48:04.000]  They're telling us, don't go look at the sunset,
[1:48:04.000 --> 1:48:06.160]  don't look at the sunrise.
[1:48:06.160 --> 1:48:12.000]  And I would like to pledge to the listeners
[1:48:12.000 --> 1:48:14.360]  that at sundown central,
[1:48:14.360 --> 1:48:17.280]  but it doesn't matter where you are in the world,
[1:48:17.280 --> 1:48:21.840]  at your sundown, that you go out for five minutes
[1:48:21.840 --> 1:48:23.560]  and just pray to God for a global awakening
[1:48:23.560 --> 1:48:25.000]  and pray to God for healing
[1:48:25.000 --> 1:48:27.560]  and pray to God to send light and love
[1:48:27.560 --> 1:48:29.640]  and good energy into the world
[1:48:29.640 --> 1:48:32.800]  to give people courage to stand up and do the right thing.
[1:48:32.800 --> 1:48:36.160]  Because especially in northern Europe,
[1:48:36.160 --> 1:48:39.320]  they found massive suicides in studies
[1:48:39.320 --> 1:48:41.880]  through the 60s and 70s and 80s.
[1:48:41.880 --> 1:48:45.360]  And so they started putting in artificial sunlights,
[1:48:45.360 --> 1:48:47.120]  they started putting in special white walls
[1:48:47.120 --> 1:48:49.800]  and the suicide stopped.
[1:48:49.800 --> 1:48:52.000]  And again, it's a certain type of sunlight,
[1:48:52.000 --> 1:48:56.160]  especially at dusk and dawn, that directly into the eyes
[1:48:56.160 --> 1:48:58.080]  does something to the cones and rides
[1:48:58.080 --> 1:49:00.720]  in the eyes that does something to the brain.
[1:49:00.720 --> 1:49:03.680]  And it's real, that's what,
[1:49:03.680 --> 1:49:06.880]  sun creates almost all life on earth, 99% of it.
[1:49:08.600 --> 1:49:11.160]  And so they don't want us doing this
[1:49:11.160 --> 1:49:13.360]  because it's better than television.
[1:49:13.360 --> 1:49:14.640]  It's better than going to the movies.
[1:49:14.640 --> 1:49:19.160]  It's, hey, make a fire if you've got a fireplace outside.
[1:49:19.160 --> 1:49:20.320]  Don't go sit around that.
[1:49:20.320 --> 1:49:23.600]  I mean, that's, it's simple stuff I'm saying.
[1:49:23.600 --> 1:49:26.720]  See, this is not rocket science.
[1:49:26.720 --> 1:49:29.920]  Spend time with your family, love yourself, love God.
[1:49:29.920 --> 1:49:31.080]  Don't let them put you down.
[1:49:31.080 --> 1:49:32.360]  Don't make them think you're ugly.
[1:49:32.360 --> 1:49:34.240]  Don't make them think you're a failure.
[1:49:34.240 --> 1:49:36.200]  Don't make them think you're a nobody.
[1:49:36.200 --> 1:49:38.160]  Now this whole worldly system is such a lie.
[1:49:38.160 --> 1:49:41.760]  You were made by God and you know the truth
[1:49:41.760 --> 1:49:45.280]  and knowing the truth and having that connection to truth
[1:49:45.280 --> 1:49:46.240]  is everything.
[1:49:47.560 --> 1:49:50.240]  Bill Gates is the poorest man in the world.
[1:49:50.240 --> 1:49:52.200]  Those of you that know God and know justice
[1:49:52.200 --> 1:49:56.520]  and have the satisfaction and the commitment
[1:49:56.520 --> 1:49:59.880]  and the feeling of beyond satisfaction,
[1:49:59.880 --> 1:50:03.520]  the word is completion, the word is peace.
[1:50:03.520 --> 1:50:04.800]  And we need that.
[1:50:05.720 --> 1:50:08.960]  And we need the forest and we need the ocean
[1:50:08.960 --> 1:50:11.280]  and we need the birds, we need the bees
[1:50:11.280 --> 1:50:13.120]  and we need the sun and we need the moon
[1:50:13.120 --> 1:50:15.440]  and we need the stars to realize
[1:50:15.440 --> 1:50:16.880]  that these little ugly monsters
[1:50:16.880 --> 1:50:20.200]  that seek to play God are gonna be our testers.
[1:50:21.040 --> 1:50:23.640]  But they will be removed.
[1:50:23.640 --> 1:50:25.760]  They're the losers.
[1:50:25.760 --> 1:50:27.240]  They're the village idiots.
[1:50:29.240 --> 1:50:31.280]  Now let's talk about solutions.
[1:50:31.280 --> 1:50:34.080]  The Australian Prime Minister that poses as a conservative
[1:50:35.240 --> 1:50:38.080]  acts like it's up to the regional governors,
[1:50:38.080 --> 1:50:39.800]  the premiers to do what they want,
[1:50:39.800 --> 1:50:43.560]  but he's let them do the worst global control
[1:50:43.560 --> 1:50:45.280]  the planet's ever seen.
[1:50:45.280 --> 1:50:47.040]  I mean, this is beyond North Korea.
[1:50:47.040 --> 1:50:48.920]  This is beyond East Germany.
[1:50:48.920 --> 1:50:52.280]  This is beyond, it's horrible.
[1:50:52.280 --> 1:50:54.960]  It's super abusive, it's beyond evil.
[1:50:54.960 --> 1:50:58.000]  And now he came out after he saw riots all over the country
[1:50:58.000 --> 1:51:01.360]  that overran the police, overran everything
[1:51:01.360 --> 1:51:03.320]  because he knows the Aussies are gonna start
[1:51:03.320 --> 1:51:04.320]  burning stuff down.
[1:51:05.160 --> 1:51:08.880]  And so he's like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, let's stop now.
[1:51:08.880 --> 1:51:11.840]  We'll have to accept one or two cases.
[1:51:11.840 --> 1:51:13.560]  Imagine one or two cases.
[1:51:13.560 --> 1:51:16.560]  They're just suppressing that their cases are in the country.
[1:51:16.560 --> 1:51:18.120]  I mean, police running people over,
[1:51:18.120 --> 1:51:20.960]  people police stomping on people's heads.
[1:51:20.960 --> 1:51:25.960]  I mean, the Australian police are just a absolute menace.
[1:51:27.560 --> 1:51:30.440]  We don't see the left complaining about that.
[1:51:30.440 --> 1:51:32.920]  So just a week ago, their leader was saying,
[1:51:32.920 --> 1:51:34.880]  the lockdowns continue until 70% of you
[1:51:34.880 --> 1:51:38.040]  take this deadly shot, but it's your right not to take it.
[1:51:38.040 --> 1:51:40.760]  But now because the people are resisting,
[1:51:40.760 --> 1:51:45.280]  well, you see what's happening, and because they understand
[1:51:45.280 --> 1:51:47.640]  that finally the public's finding its will,
[1:51:47.640 --> 1:51:49.000]  they're backing down.
[1:51:49.000 --> 1:51:50.000]  Same thing in the UK.
[1:51:50.000 --> 1:51:53.000]  They're now taking over TV stations peacefully.
[1:51:53.000 --> 1:51:54.280]  They're trying to take our lives over,
[1:51:54.280 --> 1:51:55.720]  they're trying to take our bodies over,
[1:51:55.720 --> 1:51:56.880]  trying to follow the Nuremberg code,
[1:51:56.880 --> 1:51:58.400]  trying to put something deadly in us.
[1:51:58.400 --> 1:52:00.120]  I mean, what do you want us to do?
[1:52:02.080 --> 1:52:04.280]  When you're pepper spraying people's children and stuff,
[1:52:04.280 --> 1:52:07.680]  you think the good guys that don't want power
[1:52:07.680 --> 1:52:09.880]  and don't want violence, you think when you beat our kids up
[1:52:09.880 --> 1:52:12.240]  and our wives up and our fathers and brothers up,
[1:52:12.240 --> 1:52:13.760]  you think it makes us go away?
[1:52:13.760 --> 1:52:16.440]  No, it makes us think about what we're gonna do to you
[1:52:16.440 --> 1:52:18.520]  and we will do something, don't you worry about that.
[1:52:18.520 --> 1:52:20.320]  Oh, and you're like, good, we'll call you terrorists.
[1:52:20.320 --> 1:52:21.320]  Oh, really?
[1:52:21.320 --> 1:52:23.000]  You'll just get the whole party going, won't you?
[1:52:23.000 --> 1:52:24.680]  You can't even hold Afghanistan.
[1:52:24.680 --> 1:52:28.560]  You can't run your blue cities full of feces and fentanyl.
[1:52:28.560 --> 1:52:30.320]  All you can do is murder us all day
[1:52:30.320 --> 1:52:33.080]  and sit around and slap yourselves on the back.
[1:52:33.080 --> 1:52:35.320]  But I see the videos in Angie Pelosi's parties
[1:52:35.320 --> 1:52:36.720]  and Barack Obama's parties.
[1:52:36.720 --> 1:52:38.520]  It looks like a bunch of trash
[1:52:38.520 --> 1:52:40.400]  and a bunch of unhappy garbage
[1:52:40.400 --> 1:52:44.120]  that all know they're losers and all know they're jokes.
[1:52:44.120 --> 1:52:46.120]  All a bunch of posing fakes
[1:52:46.120 --> 1:52:49.040]  that signed onto the wrong side of the universe.
[1:52:52.200 --> 1:52:54.200]  Powerful video coming up.
[1:52:54.200 --> 1:52:55.880]  It's on infowars.com.
[1:52:55.880 --> 1:52:57.640]  Los Angeles Fire Department Captain
[1:52:57.640 --> 1:52:59.600]  under investigation for video,
[1:52:59.600 --> 1:53:01.600]  slamming COVID vaccine tyranny.
[1:53:01.600 --> 1:53:02.440]  Well, you know what?
[1:53:02.440 --> 1:53:04.360]  You're under investigation for tyranny.
[1:53:04.360 --> 1:53:05.920]  You're under investigation for pushing
[1:53:05.920 --> 1:53:08.120]  a deep population weapon on us globalists.
[1:53:08.120 --> 1:53:10.760]  You're under investigation for trying to censor us.
[1:53:10.760 --> 1:53:13.240]  You're under investigation, New World Order.
[1:53:14.360 --> 1:53:15.960]  I ain't got all your 10 badges
[1:53:15.960 --> 1:53:17.560]  in your Justice Department crap,
[1:53:17.560 --> 1:53:19.400]  but I got justice and freedom
[1:53:19.400 --> 1:53:20.880]  and human history on my side
[1:53:20.880 --> 1:53:22.360]  and the tyrants are zero
[1:53:22.360 --> 1:53:24.520]  and humanity's batting a thousand.
[1:53:27.000 --> 1:53:28.680]  Well, let's talk about this because I mentioned it.
[1:53:28.680 --> 1:53:30.000]  Here's Tucker Carlson last night
[1:53:30.000 --> 1:53:31.800]  talking about Satanism,
[1:53:31.800 --> 1:53:34.560]  being the Democratic Party's operating system.
[1:53:34.560 --> 1:53:37.640]  They say that in the high budget film,
[1:53:37.640 --> 1:53:39.040]  Hail Satan.
[1:53:39.040 --> 1:53:39.880]  They go all over the country
[1:53:39.880 --> 1:53:41.680]  until the Democrats saying they're Satanist
[1:53:41.680 --> 1:53:43.880]  in huge parties and that is who they are.
[1:53:43.880 --> 1:53:46.200]  I've been around them, I've seen it.
[1:53:46.200 --> 1:53:48.040]  So here it is.
[1:53:48.040 --> 1:53:49.920]  I ain't in destroying this country.
[1:53:51.640 --> 1:53:52.600]  What do you think?
[1:53:52.600 --> 1:53:53.960]  I've always wondered this.
[1:53:53.960 --> 1:53:56.920]  Like what is the actual support for the ideas?
[1:53:56.920 --> 1:53:58.840]  Not, you know, do you like Trump or Biden?
[1:53:58.840 --> 1:54:01.960]  But for example, do you think men can get pregnant?
[1:54:01.960 --> 1:54:04.960]  Or do you think some races are morally superior
[1:54:04.960 --> 1:54:05.840]  to other races?
[1:54:05.840 --> 1:54:07.720]  Like the core idea is the Democratic Party.
[1:54:07.720 --> 1:54:09.840]  How many Americans actually believe that stuff?
[1:54:09.840 --> 1:54:10.880]  Would you guess?
[1:54:12.600 --> 1:54:16.960]  I don't think 5% of America believes it.
[1:54:16.960 --> 1:54:18.600]  Maybe 10%.
[1:54:18.600 --> 1:54:19.920]  I don't know.
[1:54:19.920 --> 1:54:22.840]  Tucker, I'm gonna say something difficult to unpack
[1:54:22.840 --> 1:54:24.080]  in this short amount of time,
[1:54:24.080 --> 1:54:26.280]  but it's what I truly believe.
[1:54:26.280 --> 1:54:29.320]  I think a lot of what the left supports is Satanic.
[1:54:29.320 --> 1:54:30.480]  I'm just sorry.
[1:54:30.480 --> 1:54:34.680]  It's indirect objection to God
[1:54:34.680 --> 1:54:38.360]  and indirect objection to the De Deo Christian values
[1:54:38.360 --> 1:54:40.880]  that were at the foundation of this country.
[1:54:40.880 --> 1:54:45.640]  And those Christian values are why we made so much progress
[1:54:45.640 --> 1:54:47.680]  in terms of freedom and humanity
[1:54:47.680 --> 1:54:49.520]  and the way we treat everybody.
[1:54:49.520 --> 1:54:53.800]  Yes, it was hard, but our Christian values compelled us
[1:54:53.800 --> 1:54:56.760]  to sacrifice our lives for the freedoms
[1:54:56.760 --> 1:55:00.120]  of other Americans, of slaves,
[1:55:00.120 --> 1:55:01.960]  and through the civil rights movement.
[1:55:01.960 --> 1:55:04.720]  Our Christian values compelled us to take risks
[1:55:04.720 --> 1:55:06.720]  and fight for equality
[1:55:06.720 --> 1:55:09.600]  and the equality of opportunity for everybody.
[1:55:09.600 --> 1:55:14.280]  I just, I see a lot of what's going on here is,
[1:55:14.280 --> 1:55:15.120]  I'm just sorry.
[1:55:15.120 --> 1:55:16.400]  I'm a man of faith.
[1:55:16.400 --> 1:55:17.920]  I was raised in the church.
[1:55:17.920 --> 1:55:19.560]  This stuff is Satanic.
[1:55:19.560 --> 1:55:22.960]  That's what's at the foundation of a lot of this stuff.
[1:55:22.960 --> 1:55:23.800]  That's right.
[1:55:23.800 --> 1:55:25.600]  Well, I'm a pretty mild Protestant personally,
[1:55:25.600 --> 1:55:27.120]  but I completely agree with you,
[1:55:27.120 --> 1:55:28.120]  especially the gender stuff.
[1:55:28.120 --> 1:55:30.840]  When you say you can change your own gender by wishing it,
[1:55:30.840 --> 1:55:32.600]  you're saying you're God.
[1:55:32.600 --> 1:55:33.440]  And that is Satanic.
[1:55:33.440 --> 1:55:35.080]  I completely agree.
[1:55:35.080 --> 1:55:35.920]  That's right.
[1:55:35.920 --> 1:55:40.320]  Anyway, but it's all about gas lining us
[1:55:40.320 --> 1:55:42.120]  where they say what they want, when they want,
[1:55:42.120 --> 1:55:43.680]  they make us accept it.
[1:55:43.680 --> 1:55:48.680]  And Bathalomet is, doing the whole deal, is by gendered.
[1:55:50.360 --> 1:55:54.000]  So that's what this whole thing is, is Satanism.
[1:55:54.000 --> 1:55:56.120]  That's why Mel Gibson did a great job in Passion of Christ.
[1:55:56.120 --> 1:55:59.320]  You notice the devil in that is Amphrodite.
[1:55:59.320 --> 1:56:02.160]  So powerful information.
[1:56:02.160 --> 1:56:03.960]  You'll see the film, Hell Satan.
[1:56:03.960 --> 1:56:05.840]  I mean, the whole thing is the Democratic Party
[1:56:05.840 --> 1:56:06.680]  are now Satanist.
[1:56:06.680 --> 1:56:09.640]  And you go out to their events, undercover,
[1:56:09.640 --> 1:56:12.720]  they talk about how much they love Satan and all of it.
[1:56:12.720 --> 1:56:16.880]  And they're really just a bunch of really soft, weird nerds
[1:56:18.120 --> 1:56:21.080]  that know Satan rules the planet.
[1:56:21.080 --> 1:56:23.160]  And they just want some petty power.
[1:56:23.160 --> 1:56:25.680]  And then they also make jokes about, oh, it doesn't exist.
[1:56:25.680 --> 1:56:26.760]  There's not really Satanism,
[1:56:26.760 --> 1:56:29.400]  but then that's how they suck everybody into it
[1:56:29.400 --> 1:56:30.240]  to control them.
[1:56:30.240 --> 1:56:33.280]  Oh, and it goes out to the abortion rallies
[1:56:33.280 --> 1:56:34.840]  and they literally, the majority of them are,
[1:56:34.840 --> 1:56:37.280]  I wanna kill babies, I love Satan.
[1:56:38.200 --> 1:56:40.240]  And they're just demonic.
[1:56:40.240 --> 1:56:43.480]  The women act like rabid dogs or something.
[1:56:43.480 --> 1:56:44.600]  And this is what they've been turned into.
[1:56:44.600 --> 1:56:45.880]  They don't love men, they don't love women,
[1:56:45.880 --> 1:56:46.720]  they love nobody.
[1:56:46.720 --> 1:56:49.280]  They just run around and Satan, Satan, kill, kill.
[1:56:49.280 --> 1:56:51.520]  We're gonna come back with our special guest.
[1:56:51.520 --> 1:56:54.400]  This video went super, super ultra viral.
[1:56:54.400 --> 1:56:57.160]  And by the way, that video is up on band.video.
[1:56:57.160 --> 1:57:01.240]  I hope that you share the video by Dr. Sean M. Brooks,
[1:57:01.240 --> 1:57:04.440]  PhD, over a million, a hundred thousand views right now.
[1:57:04.440 --> 1:57:06.640]  He'll be joining us to really have the floor
[1:57:06.640 --> 1:57:07.920]  coming up separately.

[1:57:40.880 --> 1:57:42.560]  So thanks for keeping us on the air
[1:57:42.560 --> 1:57:44.800]  and get a t-shirt while you're at it.
[1:57:44.800 --> 1:57:46.920]  We'll be back with our number three.
[1:57:46.920 --> 1:57:51.920]  Humanity is the main stakeholder on this planet.
[1:57:53.000 --> 1:57:54.560]  But the big corporations for a hundred years
[1:57:54.560 --> 1:57:56.560]  have told us that humans are bad and evil
[1:57:56.560 --> 1:57:57.720]  and a pest wants on the earth
[1:57:57.720 --> 1:57:59.640]  so that we begin to believe we're bad
[1:57:59.640 --> 1:58:01.200]  and we'll turn off our life force
[1:58:01.200 --> 1:58:03.280]  and let the eugenics-based globalists
[1:58:03.280 --> 1:58:04.800]  take control of the planet.
[1:58:04.800 --> 1:58:06.040]  If you let a clown swab
[1:58:06.040 --> 1:58:08.600]  to have the Davis Group's own Wikipedia page,
[1:58:08.600 --> 1:58:12.040]  he brags on there about how they're capturing democracy
[1:58:12.040 --> 1:58:14.440]  and taking over governments worldwide
[1:58:14.440 --> 1:58:17.040]  to set up a corporate dictatorship under the UN.
[1:58:17.040 --> 1:58:19.320]  They admit all of this.
[1:58:19.320 --> 1:58:22.280]  They plan the lockdowns, they release the viruses,
[1:58:22.280 --> 1:58:24.040]  they think you're stupid,
[1:58:24.040 --> 1:58:26.800]  and their plan is to slowly cut off the resources
[1:58:26.800 --> 1:58:29.280]  so they can dictate total social control
[1:58:29.280 --> 1:58:30.720]  over you and your lives.
[1:58:30.720 --> 1:58:33.720]  That's how I was able to predict everything they did
[1:58:33.720 --> 1:58:35.800]  decades before they executed it,
[1:58:35.800 --> 1:58:38.680]  word for word with total precision
[1:58:38.680 --> 1:58:41.280]  because they have a detailed battle plan.
[1:58:41.280 --> 1:58:43.880]  We cover it live weekdays, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.
[1:58:43.880 --> 1:58:45.920]  at infowars.com for a live show.
[1:58:45.920 --> 1:58:48.360]  Tell everybody to tune in now and war the world.
[1:58:50.640 --> 1:58:51.920]  So what's the most important part?
[1:58:51.920 --> 1:58:53.920]  Let's say the bulldozers are running over the globalists.
[1:58:53.920 --> 1:58:57.360]  The treads, the wheels, the engine, the scoop on the front,
[1:58:57.360 --> 1:59:00.120]  it's all very important, but the fuel is paramount
[1:59:00.120 --> 1:59:02.080]  and that's my allegory.
[1:59:02.080 --> 1:59:04.920]  Turbo force is vitamins, minerals, amino acids
[1:59:04.920 --> 1:59:08.080]  that synergistically work with six different natural forms
[1:59:08.080 --> 1:59:10.480]  of healthy clean energy that last for 10 hours
[1:59:10.480 --> 1:59:13.120]  in the average metabolic system, metabolism of a human.
[1:59:13.120 --> 1:59:14.520]  Some people get 15 hours out of this,
[1:59:14.520 --> 1:59:15.480]  some people get about eight hours,
[1:59:15.480 --> 1:59:17.440]  but people take this, people are taking sports,
[1:59:17.440 --> 1:59:19.640]  people cannot believe it's the best they've ever had
[1:59:19.640 --> 1:59:21.160]  because it's not high.
[1:59:21.160 --> 1:59:25.200]  Nobody puts as much product into their pre-workouts,
[1:59:25.200 --> 1:59:27.080]  their post-workouts, you can call us whatever you want.
[1:59:27.080 --> 1:59:30.120]  It's a total solution all around the best you're gonna find.
[1:59:30.120 --> 1:59:33.400]  Turbo force, without you, we don't roll.
[1:59:33.400 --> 1:59:35.080]  With you, we search forward together.
[1:59:35.080 --> 1:59:37.120]  It's like the bulldozer without the diesel fuel.
[1:59:37.120 --> 1:59:38.680]  If we don't have your financial support,
[1:59:38.680 --> 1:59:39.760]  we will be defeated.
[1:59:39.760 --> 1:59:41.400]  You support us to get products you already need
[1:59:41.400 --> 1:59:43.200]  that literally fuel your body and your mind.
[1:59:43.200 --> 1:59:45.240]  It's a win-win, 360 together.
[1:59:45.240 --> 1:59:49.080]  Infowarstore.com or AAA-253-3139.
[1:59:52.920 --> 1:59:55.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:00:02.080 --> 2:00:11.240]  From the front lines of the
[2:00:11.240 --> 2:00:14.520]  information war, it's Alex Jones.
[2:00:20.520 --> 2:00:22.800]  While the mockingbird media implodes
[2:00:22.800 --> 2:00:25.320]  over Biden's Afghanistan disaster.
[2:00:25.320 --> 2:00:27.240]  Heard President Biden say yesterday
[2:00:27.240 --> 2:00:30.960]  in his comments to ABC News that this is not a failure
[2:00:30.960 --> 2:00:33.760]  and I think a lot of people outside that airport,
[2:00:33.760 --> 2:00:36.440]  particularly those taking the kinds of extreme actions
[2:00:36.440 --> 2:00:38.760]  we're just talking about, would like to know,
[2:00:38.760 --> 2:00:43.040]  if this isn't failure, what does failure look like exactly?
[2:00:43.040 --> 2:00:45.280]  Mr. Ambassador, thank you for joining me, sir.
[2:00:45.280 --> 2:00:47.760]  You know this territory very well.
[2:00:47.760 --> 2:00:50.680]  Is President Biden right on this?
[2:00:50.680 --> 2:00:53.080]  The question of leaving is one thing
[2:00:53.080 --> 2:00:55.840]  and that's an arguable decision,
[2:00:55.840 --> 2:01:00.040]  but the manner of believing has been an absolute disaster,
[2:01:00.040 --> 2:01:02.560]  totally lacking in planning,
[2:01:02.560 --> 2:01:06.160]  executed faster than it needed to be
[2:01:06.160 --> 2:01:08.720]  and in doing so psychologically
[2:01:08.720 --> 2:01:11.240]  destroyed the confidence of the Afghans.
[2:01:11.240 --> 2:01:13.920]  They feel that the rug was pulled out from under them.
[2:01:13.920 --> 2:01:18.160]  You hear criticism from the Brits, from Germany, from France
[2:01:18.160 --> 2:01:22.480]  and that is really hurting American position overseas
[2:01:22.480 --> 2:01:25.200]  and these cables, the dissent memo
[2:01:25.200 --> 2:01:29.040]  and these cables now from the Afghan employees
[2:01:29.040 --> 2:01:31.880]  at the State Department we've got in the last 24 hours
[2:01:31.880 --> 2:01:33.360]  are devastating.
[2:01:33.360 --> 2:01:35.360]  We have destroyed morale.
[2:01:35.360 --> 2:01:38.520]  Those addicted to the lie are dancing in the streets
[2:01:38.520 --> 2:01:42.520]  while thousands of Americans are trapped behind enemy lines.
[2:01:42.520 --> 2:01:44.720]  And we're so tribalistic as a country,
[2:01:44.720 --> 2:01:46.680]  it's hard for somebody to imagine a Republican
[2:01:46.680 --> 2:01:48.640]  saying everybody's responsible.
[2:01:48.640 --> 2:01:53.040]  But let's keep in mind, Mike Pompeo met with the Taliban.
[2:01:53.040 --> 2:01:55.080]  As Donald Trump was publicly saying,
[2:01:55.080 --> 2:01:57.080]  we have to get out of Afghanistan at all costs,
[2:01:57.080 --> 2:01:58.040]  it's not worth it.
[2:01:58.040 --> 2:01:59.920]  Mike Pompeo meets with the Taliban
[2:01:59.920 --> 2:02:02.040]  and tries to negotiate something.
[2:02:02.040 --> 2:02:03.840]  By the way, they ended up getting rolled harder
[2:02:03.840 --> 2:02:07.040]  than almost as bad as Neville Chamberlain
[2:02:07.040 --> 2:02:08.800]  because they knew what the desired outcome
[2:02:08.800 --> 2:02:10.600]  of the Trump administration was.
[2:02:10.600 --> 2:02:12.880]  So they set this up to fail.
[2:02:12.880 --> 2:02:15.360]  But those who live by the propaganda
[2:02:15.360 --> 2:02:18.680]  will die by the propaganda as Brian Stelter's
[2:02:18.680 --> 2:02:21.600]  wrong think spectacle flipped the script
[2:02:21.600 --> 2:02:23.920]  on the historical disaster clinging
[2:02:23.920 --> 2:02:28.240]  to the radical left ideology, supporting the senile Joe Biden
[2:02:28.240 --> 2:02:30.200]  no matter what he does.
[2:02:30.200 --> 2:02:32.360]  The Biden quote has stuck to his guns
[2:02:32.360 --> 2:02:34.160]  fall under attack in the press,
[2:02:34.160 --> 2:02:35.480]  laying out a case for the limits
[2:02:35.480 --> 2:02:37.240]  of American military power.
[2:02:37.240 --> 2:02:39.440]  So, Matthew Dowd, you would describe
[2:02:39.440 --> 2:02:42.000]  the media's coverage this week as what?
[2:02:42.000 --> 2:02:44.480]  Way over the top and unconnected
[2:02:44.480 --> 2:02:47.720]  to a perspective on the issue from the beginning.
[2:02:47.720 --> 2:02:51.080]  They added more perspective in the final days,
[2:02:51.080 --> 2:02:51.920]  but from the beginning,
[2:02:51.920 --> 2:02:53.760]  they didn't have a perspective on it.
[2:02:53.760 --> 2:02:57.120]  My sense of this is, Joe Biden has done,
[2:02:57.120 --> 2:02:59.840]  we should judge it by the data of what's happened
[2:02:59.840 --> 2:03:03.480]  and not by anecdotes, and sometimes the press
[2:03:03.480 --> 2:03:06.240]  has a tendency to judge things by anecdotes
[2:03:06.240 --> 2:03:07.080]  and not the data.
[2:03:07.080 --> 2:03:10.280]  And the data for the last week shows Joe Biden
[2:03:10.280 --> 2:03:13.560]  has basically gotten 30,000 people out of Afghanistan
[2:03:13.560 --> 2:03:16.040]  without a single loss of an American life.
[2:03:16.040 --> 2:03:19.120]  I think that we also see why it was so hard
[2:03:19.120 --> 2:03:21.920]  for presidents in the past to pull out of Afghanistan.
[2:03:21.920 --> 2:03:25.600]  They were afraid of exactly this kind of press over reaction.
[2:03:25.600 --> 2:03:28.960]  There's no way to surrender, leave, withdraw,
[2:03:28.960 --> 2:03:32.000]  whatever you wanna call it, in a war
[2:03:32.000 --> 2:03:33.600]  without things getting ugly.
[2:03:33.600 --> 2:03:36.440]  And I feel there was something Pollyanna-ish
[2:03:36.440 --> 2:03:39.480]  about expecting anything different,
[2:03:39.480 --> 2:03:41.680]  and it disappoints me that the press
[2:03:41.680 --> 2:03:43.600]  is behaving in this way.
[2:03:43.600 --> 2:03:47.400]  House Speaker Pelosi, who just held a maskless luncheon
[2:03:47.400 --> 2:03:50.560]  in Napa Valley while the servants wore masks,
[2:03:50.560 --> 2:03:54.480]  laughably praised Biden's undeniable debacle,
[2:03:54.480 --> 2:03:59.000]  writing, I want to acknowledge the clarity of purpose
[2:03:59.000 --> 2:04:01.120]  of President Biden's statements
[2:04:01.120 --> 2:04:03.760]  and the wisdom of his actions.
[2:04:03.760 --> 2:04:05.640]  In the coming weeks and months,
[2:04:05.640 --> 2:04:08.960]  these words will come back to haunt all of them.
[2:04:08.960 --> 2:04:10.480]  John Bown reporting.
[2:04:10.480 --> 2:04:13.880]  I'm not gonna sit here and take it anymore.
[2:04:13.880 --> 2:04:15.680]  By the way, folks, I'm not bragging.
[2:04:15.680 --> 2:04:18.080]  I'm just so proud of all of our reporters
[2:04:18.080 --> 2:04:20.200]  and all of our people that file reports,
[2:04:20.200 --> 2:04:24.160]  like John Bown and Gregory and everybody else.
[2:04:24.160 --> 2:04:26.800]  I mean, that's three reports that Bown filed today.
[2:04:26.800 --> 2:04:30.040]  They're all absolutely excellent.
[2:04:30.040 --> 2:04:31.760]  And one of the big reports he just filed today
[2:04:31.760 --> 2:04:35.120]  deals with Pfizer's whole history
[2:04:35.120 --> 2:04:37.680]  of experimental deadly drugs and secret testing.
[2:04:37.680 --> 2:04:41.720]  Now they're the most fined, most indicted company out there.
[2:04:41.720 --> 2:04:43.680]  And that's a very important report dealing
[2:04:43.680 --> 2:04:46.000]  with the global rebellion is starting against that.
[2:04:46.000 --> 2:04:47.120]  So that's all coming up.
[2:04:47.120 --> 2:04:48.240]  I really wanted to get him on.
[2:04:48.240 --> 2:04:49.280]  The crew got him.
[2:04:49.280 --> 2:04:52.920]  Dr. Sean M. Brooks, PhD, very well-spoken.
[2:04:52.920 --> 2:04:54.360]  He's with us straight ahead.
[2:04:54.360 --> 2:04:56.520]  We'll replay what he said at the school board
[2:04:56.520 --> 2:04:57.920]  and then we'll go right to him.
[2:05:00.080 --> 2:05:03.800]  Not all vitamin and mineral supplements are equal.
[2:05:03.800 --> 2:05:04.920]  Many of them are synthetic.
[2:05:04.920 --> 2:05:06.840]  Many of them have fillers and additives.
[2:05:06.840 --> 2:05:08.760]  Many of them just pass right through the body
[2:05:08.760 --> 2:05:09.920]  and are absorbed.
[2:05:09.920 --> 2:05:12.960]  Well, that's not the case with our incredibly popular,
[2:05:12.960 --> 2:05:14.960]  because it's some effective product
[2:05:14.960 --> 2:05:16.600]  that has now been sold out for months,
[2:05:16.600 --> 2:05:18.800]  but it's finally back in style.
[2:05:18.800 --> 2:05:21.160]  And that is vitamin mineral fusion.
[2:05:21.160 --> 2:05:24.280]  All the essential vitamins, all the essential minerals,
[2:05:24.280 --> 2:05:26.880]  a bunch of key amino acids to help it upload better
[2:05:26.880 --> 2:05:28.360]  into your body and your cells.
[2:05:28.360 --> 2:05:29.720]  It's in powder form.
[2:05:29.720 --> 2:05:30.560]  It's great for children.
[2:05:30.560 --> 2:05:31.480]  It's great for adults.
[2:05:31.480 --> 2:05:34.000]  It's really important for folks that are older,
[2:05:34.000 --> 2:05:36.040]  because they don't absorb as well through their guts.
[2:05:36.040 --> 2:05:38.520]  So this liquid formula really, really does it.
[2:05:38.520 --> 2:05:40.880]  You mix up a picture of it every couple of days,
[2:05:40.880 --> 2:05:43.800]  put it in the refrigerator, or keep it out in the kitchen.
[2:05:43.800 --> 2:05:45.160]  And just remember to drink it in the morning
[2:05:45.160 --> 2:05:46.160]  and in the evening.
[2:05:46.160 --> 2:05:47.240]  It tastes great.
[2:05:47.240 --> 2:05:48.520]  It makes your body healthy.
[2:05:48.520 --> 2:05:50.080]  It boosts your immune system.
[2:05:50.080 --> 2:05:52.360]  And it funds the InfoWar.
[2:05:52.360 --> 2:05:53.920]  A true 360 win.
[2:05:53.920 --> 2:05:56.200]  So vitamin mineral fusion sold out for months
[2:05:56.200 --> 2:05:57.880]  is back in style for a limited time,
[2:05:57.880 --> 2:05:59.720]  33% off InfoWarStore.com.
[2:06:03.080 --> 2:06:05.640]  Waging war on corruption.
[2:06:05.640 --> 2:06:08.520]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live
[2:06:08.520 --> 2:06:11.200]  from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[2:06:12.560 --> 2:06:16.080]  Well, we played clips of probably 500 doctors
[2:06:16.080 --> 2:06:17.680]  and scientists and nurses or more.
[2:06:17.680 --> 2:06:19.760]  I mean, I air like 10 or 15 a day.
[2:06:19.760 --> 2:06:21.760]  Something like 20, 30 a day.
[2:06:21.760 --> 2:06:26.760]  But there was a particular video of a PhD in education,
[2:06:28.400 --> 2:06:31.840]  stands up to school board, says vaccine will die,
[2:06:31.840 --> 2:06:34.160]  that I really thought was powerful and well said.
[2:06:34.160 --> 2:06:36.240]  When I plugged it yesterday at 80 something thousand views,
[2:06:36.240 --> 2:06:40.800]  it's got a million, 91,000 views at band.video.
[2:06:40.800 --> 2:06:43.320]  I hope all of you will share it.
[2:06:43.320 --> 2:06:44.920]  And I'm really excited to get him on.
[2:06:44.920 --> 2:06:48.480]  We've got several medical doctors that are huge,
[2:06:48.480 --> 2:06:50.080]  joining us tomorrow to talk about this.
[2:06:50.080 --> 2:06:52.440]  We've had epidemiologists, we've had scientists.
[2:06:52.440 --> 2:06:54.600]  You've seen the former chief scientist at Pfizer,
[2:06:54.600 --> 2:06:56.880]  go public and say the vaccine's deadly.
[2:06:56.880 --> 2:07:00.000]  You've seen the head advisor to the EU, say it's deadly.
[2:07:01.320 --> 2:07:03.440]  But those people get censored.
[2:07:04.720 --> 2:07:06.200]  It doesn't matter if you're a school teacher,
[2:07:06.200 --> 2:07:07.480]  doesn't matter if you're an auto mechanic,
[2:07:07.480 --> 2:07:09.160]  doesn't matter if you're a mother,
[2:07:09.160 --> 2:07:11.000]  whose son took the vaccine and died.
[2:07:11.000 --> 2:07:12.800]  And that's what's happening on a young people.
[2:07:12.800 --> 2:07:14.400]  All of you should go be heard.
[2:07:14.400 --> 2:07:15.920]  All of you should speak out
[2:07:15.920 --> 2:07:18.240]  because the system doesn't want you to be heard.
[2:07:18.240 --> 2:07:19.960]  But our guests, when we produced or got him
[2:07:19.960 --> 2:07:21.520]  on the phone yesterday, wanted to talk to me and he said,
[2:07:21.520 --> 2:07:23.960]  listen, I want to clear something up.
[2:07:23.960 --> 2:07:26.840]  I went to that high school and I was there
[2:07:26.840 --> 2:07:29.720]  and I'm a well-known PhD in education.
[2:07:29.720 --> 2:07:31.520]  And when you're there, you say what town you live in,
[2:07:31.520 --> 2:07:32.360]  it's Oxford.
[2:07:32.360 --> 2:07:34.120]  I'm not a doctor from Oxford
[2:07:34.120 --> 2:07:35.200]  because the internet had been saying that.
[2:07:35.200 --> 2:07:36.080]  So that's cleared up.
[2:07:36.080 --> 2:07:38.000]  But do you still want me on?
[2:07:38.000 --> 2:07:39.600]  And I said, yeah, now that I know you are,
[2:07:39.600 --> 2:07:40.760]  I've seen your writings before
[2:07:40.760 --> 2:07:42.440]  and I've heard about some of your books.
[2:07:42.440 --> 2:07:43.480]  I really want you on the show
[2:07:43.480 --> 2:07:45.240]  because you're an articulate person
[2:07:45.240 --> 2:07:47.680]  and it doesn't matter if you're a PhD in education
[2:07:47.680 --> 2:07:49.880]  or a medical doctor or a school teacher
[2:07:49.880 --> 2:07:52.920]  or as I said, some guy that, you know,
[2:07:52.920 --> 2:07:54.760]  trades people's bushes for a living.
[2:07:54.760 --> 2:07:57.680]  We're all humans and can observe what's going on
[2:07:57.680 --> 2:07:58.520]  and speak out.
[2:07:58.520 --> 2:08:00.440]  But I love the viral video.
[2:08:00.440 --> 2:08:01.920]  It's very to the point.
[2:08:01.920 --> 2:08:02.960]  It's warning people.
[2:08:02.960 --> 2:08:04.240]  It's what they need to hear.
[2:08:04.240 --> 2:08:06.200]  So here's what you had to say to the school board.
[2:08:06.200 --> 2:08:07.960]  You're alma mater and we'll come back to you
[2:08:07.960 --> 2:08:09.400]  for the next hour and 30 minutes or so
[2:08:09.400 --> 2:08:11.960]  and then Owen Shroyer is gonna be joining us as well.
[2:08:11.960 --> 2:08:16.800]  But Dr. Sean M. Brooks, PhDs here, AmericanEducationFM.com.
[2:08:16.800 --> 2:08:19.040]  But here's what he had to say in the viral video.
[2:08:19.040 --> 2:08:20.560]  We love you each other.
[2:08:20.560 --> 2:08:23.880]  For the next person.
[2:08:30.440 --> 2:08:33.280]  We did brother, disappointed.
[2:08:34.400 --> 2:08:36.680]  My name's Dr. Sean Brooks, PhD.
[2:08:38.200 --> 2:08:43.080]  Oxford, I have 48 publications, including 23 books.
[2:08:43.080 --> 2:08:45.440]  I've studied health, medicine, anatomy and physiology
[2:08:45.440 --> 2:08:47.160]  for approximately 21 years.
[2:08:48.160 --> 2:08:51.680]  Dr. Robert Malone, who created the messenger RNA vaccine
[2:08:51.680 --> 2:08:55.280]  has said no one should ever take these jabs ever.
[2:08:55.280 --> 2:08:58.840]  Under any circumstance whatsoever, he created it
[2:08:58.840 --> 2:09:00.760]  and he says don't ever do it.
[2:09:00.760 --> 2:09:02.280]  So let me explain what's going to happen
[2:09:02.280 --> 2:09:05.040]  to the people who have taken it, excuse me.
[2:09:05.040 --> 2:09:07.080]  The people who have taken it are going to die
[2:09:07.080 --> 2:09:09.800]  in the next six months to three to five years.
[2:09:09.800 --> 2:09:11.160]  For three reasons.
[2:09:11.160 --> 2:09:14.720]  Number one, you have dramatically decreased
[2:09:14.720 --> 2:09:17.640]  your own immune system by 35%.
[2:09:17.640 --> 2:09:19.760]  The first jab did it by at least 15.
[2:09:19.760 --> 2:09:21.640]  The second did it by 35.
[2:09:21.640 --> 2:09:25.280]  Now, if you take any booster shot, you will die.
[2:09:25.280 --> 2:09:26.520]  That's it.
[2:09:26.520 --> 2:09:29.200]  You take a flu shot in the future, you will die.
[2:09:30.480 --> 2:09:33.600]  The second reason, antibody dependent enhancement.
[2:09:33.600 --> 2:09:36.400]  Antibody dependent enhancement is what is happening
[2:09:36.400 --> 2:09:39.000]  with these jabs with everybody who has taken them.
[2:09:39.000 --> 2:09:41.240]  Unless of course you've taken a placebo,
[2:09:41.240 --> 2:09:43.280]  but there's no way that you would know that.
[2:09:43.280 --> 2:09:46.000]  So given that fact, antibody dependent enhancement
[2:09:46.000 --> 2:09:48.320]  trips the entire body into believing
[2:09:48.320 --> 2:09:50.160]  that the cell that's eating the pathogen
[2:09:50.160 --> 2:09:51.880]  is eating it when it isn't.
[2:09:51.880 --> 2:09:54.840]  It ends up leading to what's called a cytokine storm
[2:09:54.840 --> 2:09:56.660]  which causes organ failure.
[2:09:58.040 --> 2:10:00.880]  That will cause your death and there's no stopping that.
[2:10:00.880 --> 2:10:02.920]  No amount of drugs will stop that.
[2:10:02.920 --> 2:10:04.880]  The third thing, blood clotting.
[2:10:05.760 --> 2:10:08.400]  Everyone who has taken the jabs is blood clotting.
[2:10:08.400 --> 2:10:11.400]  If you don't believe me, there's a way you can find out.
[2:10:11.400 --> 2:10:14.120]  Take what's called a de-dimer test.
[2:10:14.120 --> 2:10:17.440]  What that does is that detects blood clotting
[2:10:17.440 --> 2:10:19.760]  at the microscopic level.
[2:10:19.760 --> 2:10:22.440]  They're cutting full blood clots out of people right now.
[2:10:22.440 --> 2:10:25.960]  As I'm talking to you, millions have died from the jabs.
[2:10:25.960 --> 2:10:28.560]  In your last meeting, you advocated for people
[2:10:28.560 --> 2:10:31.480]  to take the jabs potentially in the future,
[2:10:31.480 --> 2:10:32.920]  along with wearing masks.
[2:10:32.920 --> 2:10:35.020]  And I heard parents say the same thing.
[2:10:35.020 --> 2:10:37.600]  So to the parents who are actually considering
[2:10:37.600 --> 2:10:39.120]  jabbing their own children,
[2:10:39.120 --> 2:10:41.880]  you're going to sterilize them permanently.
[2:10:41.880 --> 2:10:45.120]  People who have taken the jabs are sterilized.
[2:10:45.120 --> 2:10:47.600]  80% of women who have been jabbed
[2:10:47.600 --> 2:10:50.440]  have lost their children in the first trimester.
[2:10:51.400 --> 2:10:52.880]  You can't have kids.
[2:10:54.240 --> 2:10:57.680]  You've also injected yourself with the equivalent of HIV.
[2:10:57.680 --> 2:11:00.600]  You can now no longer breastfeed,
[2:11:00.600 --> 2:11:02.840]  donate blood, donate organs,
[2:11:02.840 --> 2:11:05.480]  donate blood plasma, nor bone marrow.
[2:11:05.480 --> 2:11:08.160]  If you don't believe me, try to donate blood
[2:11:08.160 --> 2:11:10.920]  and blood plasma and find out what happens.
[2:11:10.920 --> 2:11:12.600]  You will be denied.
[2:11:12.600 --> 2:11:15.060]  Unless, of course, you live in California,
[2:11:15.060 --> 2:11:16.480]  in which case they're allowing people
[2:11:16.480 --> 2:11:19.880]  to donate toxic blood with spike proteins in it.
[2:11:19.880 --> 2:11:22.720]  The jabs create spike proteins.
[2:11:22.720 --> 2:11:25.680]  They're in the jabs themselves.
[2:11:25.680 --> 2:11:29.200]  And they create it by snapping your RNA in half.
[2:11:29.200 --> 2:11:31.800]  You are no longer a human anymore.
[2:11:31.800 --> 2:11:33.960]  You are something else.
[2:11:33.960 --> 2:11:37.160]  And you are susceptible to countless diseases.
[2:11:37.160 --> 2:11:38.800]  Now, here's what's going to happen in the future
[2:11:38.800 --> 2:11:40.200]  very quickly.
[2:11:40.200 --> 2:11:41.680]  You have 15 seconds.
[2:11:41.680 --> 2:11:42.520]  Great.
[2:11:42.520 --> 2:11:43.880]  I don't know what percentage of your staff
[2:11:43.880 --> 2:11:44.960]  has taken the jabs,
[2:11:44.960 --> 2:11:46.560]  but your school is going to close.
[2:11:46.560 --> 2:11:48.160]  You will not stay open.
[2:11:48.160 --> 2:11:50.000]  You will close because they will fall ill
[2:11:50.000 --> 2:11:51.640]  and they will die.
[2:11:51.640 --> 2:11:53.560]  That will happen in all of your buildings.
[2:11:53.560 --> 2:11:54.920]  It's already happening.
[2:11:54.920 --> 2:11:56.240]  All right, thank you, sir.
[2:11:56.240 --> 2:11:57.080]  I bet it is.
[2:11:57.080 --> 2:11:58.160]  It's already happening.
[2:11:58.160 --> 2:11:59.000]  Good luck.
[2:11:59.000 --> 2:12:00.200]  If nothing can stop, let's go.
[2:12:00.200 --> 2:12:01.200]  Thank you, sir.
[2:12:01.200 --> 2:12:02.440]  Thank you, sir.
[2:12:02.440 --> 2:12:04.880]  All right, so we need to be alarmist about this
[2:12:04.880 --> 2:12:06.640]  because this is the big globalist movement.
[2:12:06.640 --> 2:12:08.160]  Everything he says, you can document.
[2:12:08.160 --> 2:12:10.560]  In fact, he says 80% in first trial master.
[2:12:10.560 --> 2:12:11.960]  Actually, New England Medical Journal.
[2:12:11.960 --> 2:12:13.720]  It's like 83%.
[2:12:13.720 --> 2:12:15.320]  So he's being conservative.
[2:12:15.320 --> 2:12:16.760]  He's a smart guy, well-spoken.
[2:12:16.760 --> 2:12:18.040]  I wanted to get him on.
[2:12:18.040 --> 2:12:20.040]  I appreciate Dr. Sean N. Brooks, PhD,
[2:12:20.040 --> 2:12:21.280]  coming on in short notice.
[2:12:21.280 --> 2:12:24.040]  Former public school teachers of math, science,
[2:12:24.040 --> 2:12:25.960]  health, education, anatomy, psychology,
[2:12:25.960 --> 2:12:27.880]  and former edict university professor,
[2:12:27.880 --> 2:12:29.240]  teacher education.
[2:12:29.240 --> 2:12:30.720]  Dr. Brooks is the author of several books
[2:12:30.720 --> 2:12:32.040]  on violence and school crime,
[2:12:32.040 --> 2:12:37.040]  and health and safety politics, and teacher effectiveness
[2:12:37.240 --> 2:12:39.200]  in America K through 12 in higher education.
[2:12:39.200 --> 2:12:41.000]  Dr. Brooks holds a bachelor's in health education
[2:12:41.000 --> 2:12:43.400]  Miami University, the master's PhD in education
[2:12:43.400 --> 2:12:44.520]  from Walden University.
[2:12:44.520 --> 2:12:47.400]  He's written for americathicker.com and sub-stack,
[2:12:47.400 --> 2:12:49.040]  part of the American classroom,
[2:12:49.040 --> 2:12:50.280]  and all of his books are available,
[2:12:50.280 --> 2:12:53.640]  amazon.com, americaneducationfm.com.
[2:12:53.640 --> 2:12:54.720]  Got three minutes to break.
[2:12:54.720 --> 2:12:56.880]  Really appreciate you coming on, Doc,
[2:12:56.880 --> 2:12:58.120]  so much to talk about,
[2:12:58.120 --> 2:13:01.240]  but what do you want to just say out of the gates?
[2:13:01.240 --> 2:13:02.960]  First of all, thank you for having me on.
[2:13:02.960 --> 2:13:03.880]  I appreciate it.
[2:13:05.680 --> 2:13:08.440]  I haven't taught psychology, I taught physiology,
[2:13:08.440 --> 2:13:10.280]  anatomy, and physiology at the high school level,
[2:13:10.280 --> 2:13:12.880]  but again, this is a subject that you study
[2:13:12.880 --> 2:13:16.320]  when you're studying with your bachelor's degree.
[2:13:16.320 --> 2:13:17.920]  So yeah, I'm 40 years old,
[2:13:17.920 --> 2:13:20.680]  I've been studying this since I was 18, 19 years old.
[2:13:22.440 --> 2:13:24.080]  I would just encourage people to watch
[2:13:24.080 --> 2:13:27.160]  the entire school board meeting,
[2:13:27.160 --> 2:13:28.560]  because the context matters,
[2:13:28.560 --> 2:13:31.520]  and the context in every school board meeting matters,
[2:13:31.520 --> 2:13:32.480]  from beginning to end.
[2:13:32.480 --> 2:13:34.200]  I know that a lot of people grab clips,
[2:13:34.200 --> 2:13:35.320]  and they just stick with the clip,
[2:13:35.320 --> 2:13:37.640]  but I do want to later on set up
[2:13:37.640 --> 2:13:38.960]  the entire school board meeting,
[2:13:38.960 --> 2:13:42.280]  because the individual who spoke in front of me
[2:13:42.280 --> 2:13:44.560]  was a pediatrician in town,
[2:13:44.560 --> 2:13:46.480]  and he was advocating for the masks,
[2:13:46.480 --> 2:13:48.760]  and he was advocating for the jabs,
[2:13:48.760 --> 2:13:51.120]  and there's this consistent tone
[2:13:51.120 --> 2:13:54.400]  that's occurring where they want everybody masked
[2:13:54.400 --> 2:13:55.760]  until they get the jabs,
[2:13:55.760 --> 2:13:57.360]  but what we've already seen is,
[2:13:57.360 --> 2:14:00.960]  is that they're fine pulling back on that,
[2:14:00.960 --> 2:14:02.720]  even if they've had the jabs,
[2:14:02.720 --> 2:14:05.040]  they're still having to wear the masks.
[2:14:05.040 --> 2:14:08.800]  So I was watching a pattern happen
[2:14:08.800 --> 2:14:11.560]  from back in January, in school board meetings,
[2:14:11.560 --> 2:14:14.440]  where people weren't mentioning the jabs at all.
[2:14:14.440 --> 2:14:17.560]  It was all CRT and all mask wearing.
[2:14:17.560 --> 2:14:20.240]  That was it, and I kept saying on my podcast,
[2:14:20.240 --> 2:14:22.440]  and I set it up a long, long time ago,
[2:14:22.440 --> 2:14:24.640]  I said, I'm probably gonna have to go to this,
[2:14:24.640 --> 2:14:25.880]  go to one of these maybe,
[2:14:25.880 --> 2:14:27.600]  and start talking about the jabs,
[2:14:27.600 --> 2:14:29.720]  but I'm gonna take a back seat,
[2:14:29.720 --> 2:14:31.440]  I'm gonna be conservative about this,
[2:14:31.440 --> 2:14:33.920]  and I'm gonna wait to see if someone else does it.
[2:14:33.920 --> 2:14:37.720]  And I didn't hear anybody do it for six plus months.
[2:14:37.720 --> 2:14:40.560]  And then, I thought, well,
[2:14:40.560 --> 2:14:42.760]  there's an upcoming board meeting
[2:14:42.760 --> 2:14:44.960]  at my old high school in the town where I live,
[2:14:44.960 --> 2:14:47.080]  so I'm gonna see what they talked about
[2:14:47.080 --> 2:14:48.240]  in their last meeting.
[2:14:48.240 --> 2:14:52.920]  I watched the entire last school board meeting,
[2:14:52.920 --> 2:14:55.520]  and gleefully, they were talking about
[2:14:55.520 --> 2:15:00.520]  how they had mandated masks now for K through five,
[2:15:01.520 --> 2:15:05.720]  but not six through 12, that that was optional.
[2:15:05.720 --> 2:15:07.960]  But they were still, you could hear it in their voices,
[2:15:07.960 --> 2:15:10.520]  that they were talking about, we need the jabs,
[2:15:10.520 --> 2:15:13.240]  we need to make this mandatory for our staff members,
[2:15:13.240 --> 2:15:16.400]  we need to make this ultimately mandatory for our students,
[2:15:16.400 --> 2:15:18.280]  and we have to move in that direction.
[2:15:18.280 --> 2:15:21.360]  That's very problematic for a variety of reasons.
[2:15:21.360 --> 2:15:24.160]  Extremely, especially because it's poisonous,
[2:15:24.160 --> 2:15:26.880]  and doesn't work, we're gonna go to break and come back,
[2:15:26.880 --> 2:15:29.240]  and talk about the big picture and why you got so upset
[2:15:29.240 --> 2:15:32.240]  and why you hit them so hard with that freezing cold water
[2:15:32.240 --> 2:15:33.960]  to get them out of their trance,
[2:15:33.960 --> 2:15:35.400]  to realize this isn't a game.
[2:15:35.400 --> 2:15:38.440]  Because, yeah, once people are dying later,
[2:15:38.440 --> 2:15:41.140]  they're gonna say, oh, it's a new variant or unvaccinated.
[2:15:41.140 --> 2:15:44.160]  We gotta tell them upfront, it's the shot killed you,
[2:15:44.160 --> 2:15:46.200]  so at least then they'll know what hit them.
[2:15:46.200 --> 2:15:48.600]  We're to that triage point now, folks.
[2:15:48.600 --> 2:15:49.960]  This guy's smart, he knows what he's doing.
[2:15:49.960 --> 2:15:54.200]  Dr. Shawn M. Brooks, PhD, I'm Alex Jones, stay with us.
[2:15:59.000 --> 2:15:59.920]  Hey, everybody.
[2:15:59.920 --> 2:16:02.280]  If you've ever thought about heirloom beans
[2:16:02.280 --> 2:16:05.400]  as a storable survival food, I've got great news.
[2:16:05.400 --> 2:16:07.880]  In fact, I'll bet it's the best news you've heard in a while.
[2:16:07.880 --> 2:16:09.840]  Here's the thing, we've just received
[2:16:09.840 --> 2:16:13.000]  a fresh batch of gourmet heirloom beans,
[2:16:13.000 --> 2:16:14.380]  survival soup beans.
[2:16:14.380 --> 2:16:17.120]  These beans are gorgeous, highly nutritious,
[2:16:17.120 --> 2:16:19.760]  and above all, with no hesitation whatsoever.
[2:16:19.760 --> 2:16:22.560]  The best tasting beans in the entire world.
[2:16:22.560 --> 2:16:23.640]  The best part?
[2:16:23.640 --> 2:16:26.280]  We've dropped the price by 33% this week
[2:16:26.280 --> 2:16:29.480]  for listeners who know higher food prices are coming
[2:16:29.480 --> 2:16:32.040]  and want an inflation hedge you can actually eat
[2:16:32.040 --> 2:16:33.880]  if you want to, gets even better.
[2:16:33.880 --> 2:16:36.280]  With your permission and with a high regard
[2:16:36.280 --> 2:16:37.920]  for your health and well-being,
[2:16:37.920 --> 2:16:41.040]  I also wanna send you two pounds of what we think
[2:16:41.040 --> 2:16:45.480]  is the single most underrated superfood in the world, period.

[2:17:00.800 --> 2:17:02.880]  Your voice counts.
[2:17:02.880 --> 2:17:05.480]  When you share information, be it over the internet
[2:17:05.480 --> 2:17:07.960]  or in person, it changes the world.
[2:17:07.960 --> 2:17:10.560]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[2:17:10.560 --> 2:17:12.000]  They know you're angry.
[2:17:12.000 --> 2:17:13.480]  And now to get around big tech,
[2:17:13.480 --> 2:17:14.880]  it's more important than ever
[2:17:14.880 --> 2:17:17.480]  that we use every tool we've got.

[2:18:00.120 --> 2:18:02.560]  So when I first started taking survival skills,
[2:18:02.560 --> 2:18:05.080]  basically I was 275 pounds, I was overweight.
[2:18:05.080 --> 2:18:07.440]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe.
[2:18:07.440 --> 2:18:09.280]  I was barely holding onto a job,
[2:18:09.280 --> 2:18:11.880]  and I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it.
[2:18:11.880 --> 2:18:14.520]  So the first one I got was the original survival shield,
[2:18:14.520 --> 2:18:16.320]  X1, and it worked pretty good.
[2:18:16.320 --> 2:18:18.640]  And then shortly thereafter, you came out with X2.
[2:18:18.640 --> 2:18:20.520]  You had, you know, with a deep burn source, you know,
[2:18:20.520 --> 2:18:22.360]  and I got really excited about that, so I took it.
[2:18:22.360 --> 2:18:25.560]  And man, in two weeks, I went from brain fog
[2:18:25.560 --> 2:18:28.720]  to like literally like my brain was enlightened.
[2:18:28.720 --> 2:18:30.120]  You know, I could think again,
[2:18:30.120 --> 2:18:31.960]  I could connect with people again.
[2:18:31.960 --> 2:18:34.760]  And over the course of the next couple of years,
[2:18:34.760 --> 2:18:35.800]  I got my health back,
[2:18:35.800 --> 2:18:38.360]  and I religiously take basically all of your supplements.
[2:18:38.360 --> 2:18:40.760]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[2:18:40.760 --> 2:18:42.600]  The one I like recently is knockout.
[2:18:42.600 --> 2:18:44.840]  It literally, like if you want to sleep, just take it.
[2:18:44.840 --> 2:18:46.120]  It's amazing, it works.
[2:18:46.120 --> 2:18:48.720]  But anyway, so the point is, we have to get ourselves clean.
[2:18:48.720 --> 2:18:51.200]  We have to break free of the globalist system.
[2:18:51.200 --> 2:18:53.720]  And the only way to do that is to take our own health
[2:18:53.720 --> 2:18:54.840]  into our own hands.
[2:18:54.840 --> 2:18:56.040]  Beautifully said, brother.
[2:18:56.040 --> 2:18:58.320]  I thank you so much for calling Godspeed.
[2:18:59.960 --> 2:19:02.800]  The purpose of fear is to call us into action,
[2:19:02.800 --> 2:19:05.320]  and there is plenty to be afraid of today.
[2:19:05.320 --> 2:19:08.840]  Half the population has lined up for an untested, deadly,
[2:19:08.840 --> 2:19:11.240]  and debilitating experimental injection
[2:19:11.240 --> 2:19:12.800]  because they were told to be afraid
[2:19:12.800 --> 2:19:15.400]  of an invisible asymptomatic disease.
[2:19:15.400 --> 2:19:18.440]  The perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal
[2:19:18.440 --> 2:19:21.040]  of having 80% of the population hooked up
[2:19:21.040 --> 2:19:23.640]  to an artificial intelligence hive mind
[2:19:23.640 --> 2:19:25.360]  in less than nine years.
[2:19:25.360 --> 2:19:27.760]  For those of us who have awoken from the spell,
[2:19:27.760 --> 2:19:29.600]  we know this is all really happening,
[2:19:29.600 --> 2:19:32.160]  and it's unbelievably unsettling to see.
[2:19:32.160 --> 2:19:34.680]  But there is only two things to do.
[2:19:34.680 --> 2:19:37.800]  We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game.
[2:19:37.800 --> 2:19:41.160]  If enough people awaken from the cold spell, then we win.
[2:19:41.160 --> 2:19:43.880]  But even when we win, and we eventually will,
[2:19:43.880 --> 2:19:46.520]  the days of convenience are soon coming to an end.
[2:19:46.520 --> 2:19:49.360]  And so we must prepare, get up to a year's worth
[2:19:49.360 --> 2:19:53.280]  of storable foods, water filtration, survival gear,
[2:19:53.280 --> 2:19:57.320]  seeds, shortwave radios, and lifesaving knowledge
[2:19:57.320 --> 2:19:59.400]  at infoorstore.com.
[2:19:59.400 --> 2:20:11.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:20:11.160 --> 2:20:16.080]  Welcome back.
[2:20:16.080 --> 2:20:19.720]  I have some massive breaking news that ties into all this.
[2:20:19.720 --> 2:20:21.440]  I'm going to wait till next segment to drop it
[2:20:21.440 --> 2:20:24.760]  on the audience and our guest.
[2:20:24.760 --> 2:20:28.080]  Dr. Sean M. Brooks, PhD, author, researcher, podcaster,
[2:20:28.080 --> 2:20:32.400]  American Education, FM.com, very excited listeners
[2:20:32.400 --> 2:20:35.840]  decided to share his four-minute video.
[2:20:35.840 --> 2:20:38.760]  He runs the American Education FM.
[2:20:38.760 --> 2:20:40.400]  You can see him right there on GAB.
[2:20:40.400 --> 2:20:41.840]  Be sure to follow him.
[2:20:41.840 --> 2:20:45.560]  But Doc, you've got the floor to this segment.
[2:20:45.560 --> 2:20:47.840]  But I want to just ask you a big picture.
[2:20:47.840 --> 2:20:50.600]  What would you call this time in history?
[2:20:50.600 --> 2:20:52.240]  How would you define the globalist?
[2:20:52.240 --> 2:20:56.600]  And where do you in the big picture
[2:20:56.600 --> 2:20:57.480]  think this is going?
[2:20:57.480 --> 2:20:59.720]  Because I see the evidence overwhelming.
[2:20:59.720 --> 2:21:01.320]  This is their big revolution.
[2:21:01.320 --> 2:21:02.320]  They're petal the metal.
[2:21:02.320 --> 2:21:04.080]  They're completely committed, trying
[2:21:04.080 --> 2:21:07.280]  to collapse civilization, but then poses the saviors
[2:21:07.280 --> 2:21:09.400]  and bringing a new dark age in their own words.
[2:21:09.400 --> 2:21:12.400]  I mean, I just don't think people understand the magnitude
[2:21:12.400 --> 2:21:13.400]  of what we're facing.
[2:21:13.400 --> 2:21:14.640]  Do you disagree with that statement?
[2:21:14.640 --> 2:21:17.080]  And what would you call this time we're in right now?
[2:21:17.080 --> 2:21:19.560]  It's war.
[2:21:19.560 --> 2:21:20.600]  It's that simple.
[2:21:20.600 --> 2:21:22.400]  It's war.
[2:21:22.400 --> 2:21:26.320]  And people are dying.
[2:21:26.320 --> 2:21:31.080]  And there isn't a single person in the world, I don't think,
[2:21:31.080 --> 2:21:34.320]  who this has impacted in some way.
[2:21:34.320 --> 2:21:37.600]  So I've had family members who have taken the jabs.
[2:21:37.600 --> 2:21:41.320]  I'm fully aware this has impacted everybody.
[2:21:41.320 --> 2:21:42.680]  They're not fully awake.
[2:21:42.680 --> 2:21:43.920]  They don't know what's going on.
[2:21:43.920 --> 2:21:46.320]  Cognitive dissonance is very strong.
[2:21:46.320 --> 2:21:47.640]  I fully understand that.
[2:21:47.640 --> 2:21:52.080]  But fortunately, I woke up a long time ago.
[2:21:52.080 --> 2:21:55.360]  And when you've been through the ringer in the K-12 system,
[2:21:55.360 --> 2:21:57.240]  and then you leave the K-12 system.
[2:21:57.240 --> 2:21:59.360]  And I mean, I was through the ringer as a whistleblower.
[2:21:59.360 --> 2:22:02.600]  So I mean, I went all the way through state departments
[2:22:02.600 --> 2:22:04.960]  of education and all the way back down.
[2:22:04.960 --> 2:22:07.320]  I saw how they all operate.
[2:22:07.320 --> 2:22:09.320]  I watched the entire thing.
[2:22:09.320 --> 2:22:11.760]  And again, I'm not calling myself a victim.
[2:22:11.760 --> 2:22:14.400]  I'm just saying that in K-12 education,
[2:22:14.400 --> 2:22:17.440]  there are a lot of whistleblowers out there.
[2:22:17.440 --> 2:22:20.160]  Sure, you experienced how the bureaucracy destroys
[2:22:20.160 --> 2:22:21.000]  young minds.
[2:22:21.000 --> 2:22:22.080]  And now the fraud works.
[2:22:22.080 --> 2:22:24.640]  You're saying you've been through the process.
[2:22:24.640 --> 2:22:25.640]  That's right.
[2:22:25.640 --> 2:22:29.240]  And as you would expect, state departments of education
[2:22:29.240 --> 2:22:30.760]  are remarkably corrupt.
[2:22:30.760 --> 2:22:32.120]  They stamp papers.
[2:22:32.120 --> 2:22:33.480]  They move things forward.
[2:22:33.480 --> 2:22:35.360]  School teachers can lawyer up all they want.
[2:22:35.360 --> 2:22:38.400]  It doesn't help, typically speaking anyway.
[2:22:38.400 --> 2:22:40.160]  Unions claim to stand up for them.
[2:22:40.160 --> 2:22:42.040]  They tend not to.
[2:22:42.040 --> 2:22:44.200]  It's just a giant con game.
[2:22:44.200 --> 2:22:48.000]  And what we're watching not just is a global war here,
[2:22:48.000 --> 2:22:50.120]  in my opinion, is that we're watching
[2:22:50.120 --> 2:22:53.520]  the systematic destruction of K-12 education
[2:22:53.520 --> 2:22:54.680]  and higher education.
[2:22:54.680 --> 2:22:57.600]  And frankly, it cannot be saved.
[2:22:57.600 --> 2:23:00.480]  People need to run away from these institutions.
[2:23:00.480 --> 2:23:02.640]  In my opinion, they've shown their own hand.
[2:23:02.640 --> 2:23:03.400]  Oh, I totally agree.
[2:23:03.400 --> 2:23:04.600]  They're the cancer points.
[2:23:04.600 --> 2:23:07.760]  The globalists are using these as the invasion ports
[2:23:07.760 --> 2:23:10.240]  to collapse the rest of everything, just like the blue cities
[2:23:10.240 --> 2:23:12.520]  are designed to collapse everything.
[2:23:12.520 --> 2:23:13.480]  Right.
[2:23:13.480 --> 2:23:16.000]  And they're basically seeing how much they can get away with
[2:23:16.000 --> 2:23:17.440]  and how much people will tolerate.
[2:23:17.440 --> 2:23:19.080]  Well, one of the interesting things
[2:23:19.080 --> 2:23:21.920]  is I taught the cycle of abuse formally
[2:23:21.920 --> 2:23:23.240]  when I was a school teacher.
[2:23:23.240 --> 2:23:25.640]  I taught students what that was.
[2:23:25.640 --> 2:23:27.840]  And what K-12 schools are engaging in,
[2:23:27.840 --> 2:23:30.080]  and higher education institutions are engaging in,
[2:23:30.080 --> 2:23:31.560]  is the cycle of abuse.
[2:23:31.560 --> 2:23:33.800]  They want to see how many people will come back
[2:23:33.800 --> 2:23:37.520]  to the environment and continue to be punched in the face.
[2:23:37.520 --> 2:23:39.840]  And then they give them flowers, or they give them an award,
[2:23:39.840 --> 2:23:42.240]  or they give them a pat on the back.
[2:23:42.240 --> 2:23:44.600]  And they just want to see how many times they'll come back
[2:23:44.600 --> 2:23:47.200]  and continue to get punched in the face.
[2:23:47.200 --> 2:23:50.360]  I'm sorry, but, and I've said it on my podcast
[2:23:50.360 --> 2:23:53.400]  a million times, there's no unhealthier environment
[2:23:53.400 --> 2:23:54.200]  right now.
[2:23:54.200 --> 2:23:57.200]  Because when you talk about workplace bullying,
[2:23:57.200 --> 2:24:01.600]  as the phenomenon that it is, K-12 education and hospitals
[2:24:01.600 --> 2:24:04.720]  are two of the largest environments where workplace
[2:24:04.720 --> 2:24:05.640]  bullying takes place.
[2:24:05.640 --> 2:24:06.160]  Exactly.
[2:24:06.160 --> 2:24:08.000]  They've been turned into, basically,
[2:24:08.000 --> 2:24:10.960]  open-air reeducation camps that they're laboratories
[2:24:10.960 --> 2:24:15.160]  of social control, hospitals and schools.
[2:24:15.160 --> 2:24:15.680]  That's right.
[2:24:15.680 --> 2:24:18.280]  And when you abuse the people, the adults
[2:24:18.280 --> 2:24:21.240]  who are working there who are trying to help, allegedly,
[2:24:21.240 --> 2:24:24.760]  and many of them do, and they do luminous work,
[2:24:24.760 --> 2:24:28.400]  it's inevitable that the mind of that individual
[2:24:28.400 --> 2:24:31.400]  is going to break and snap.
[2:24:31.400 --> 2:24:32.800]  It's inevitable that that's going
[2:24:32.800 --> 2:24:34.520]  to have a negative impact on the students
[2:24:34.520 --> 2:24:36.040]  that they're responsible for teaching
[2:24:36.040 --> 2:24:37.800]  factual information to.
[2:24:37.800 --> 2:24:40.560]  And that's why the turnover rate is as high as it is.
[2:24:40.560 --> 2:24:44.480]  And it's only increased in American K-12 education,
[2:24:44.480 --> 2:24:46.520]  higher education, and nurses.
[2:24:46.520 --> 2:24:50.160]  The difference now is we're seeing individuals
[2:24:50.160 --> 2:24:52.040]  leave for a variety of reasons.
[2:24:52.040 --> 2:24:56.600]  And the last reason is making them physically ill
[2:24:56.600 --> 2:25:00.120]  by a jab that is being either mandated
[2:25:00.120 --> 2:25:02.440]  or they're asking to be mandated on a number
[2:25:02.440 --> 2:25:03.560]  of different people.
[2:25:03.560 --> 2:25:05.560]  We already have the state of California
[2:25:05.560 --> 2:25:08.680]  that's told all school teachers they have to take it.
[2:25:08.680 --> 2:25:10.600]  We already have the state of Washington
[2:25:10.600 --> 2:25:13.000]  that has told all teachers they have to take it.
[2:25:13.000 --> 2:25:15.040]  And I'm not, it could be wrong here,
[2:25:15.040 --> 2:25:17.640]  but I think just the other day,
[2:25:17.640 --> 2:25:20.520]  it was all Washington DC schools,
[2:25:20.520 --> 2:25:22.680]  all their staff members had to take it also.
[2:25:22.680 --> 2:25:23.800]  And let's expand on that.
[2:25:23.800 --> 2:25:26.280]  They're spinning it, Dr. Brooks,
[2:25:26.280 --> 2:25:27.920]  that oh, we've always had mandates.
[2:25:27.920 --> 2:25:29.120]  Yeah, they've had fake mandates.
[2:25:29.120 --> 2:25:30.760]  You've got to get a vaccine waiver
[2:25:30.760 --> 2:25:32.080]  from the health department.
[2:25:32.080 --> 2:25:33.920]  They've never had it where you've got to have this
[2:25:33.920 --> 2:25:36.880]  to get on a plane or a train or have a job.
[2:25:36.880 --> 2:25:38.720]  This is unprecedented.
[2:25:38.720 --> 2:25:41.920]  Plus they want proof of it in a digital tracking system,
[2:25:41.920 --> 2:25:45.240]  which they admit is the backbone of a global ID system,
[2:25:45.240 --> 2:25:47.880]  which they'll then have carbon taxes added to.
[2:25:47.880 --> 2:25:50.440]  So we are literally having the chains
[2:25:50.440 --> 2:25:51.720]  fitted on us right now.
[2:25:53.040 --> 2:25:54.040]  Yeah, absolutely.
[2:25:54.040 --> 2:25:56.840]  I mean, it's the old, I saw a meme just the other day.
[2:25:56.840 --> 2:25:59.200]  It's the chain dog.
[2:25:59.200 --> 2:26:03.160]  When you chain a dog to a post or a tree,
[2:26:03.160 --> 2:26:06.040]  it will inevitably become very angry.
[2:26:06.040 --> 2:26:08.520]  But when you remove one link at a time,
[2:26:08.520 --> 2:26:12.120]  it will just continue to get used to the chain.
[2:26:12.120 --> 2:26:13.800]  And then eventually they're right up against the tree
[2:26:13.800 --> 2:26:15.360]  and they can't even move.
[2:26:15.360 --> 2:26:16.520]  And that's happening.
[2:26:16.520 --> 2:26:18.880]  But what's not being reported is one of the things
[2:26:18.880 --> 2:26:20.400]  that I always pay attention to.
[2:26:20.400 --> 2:26:22.920]  Cause again, I see the landscape like a lot of people do.
[2:26:22.920 --> 2:26:25.240]  And having studied qualitative reasoning and analysis,
[2:26:25.240 --> 2:26:27.320]  you look at the entire landscape.
[2:26:27.320 --> 2:26:30.520]  Having published research articles in XYZ,
[2:26:30.520 --> 2:26:31.440]  you have to do that.
[2:26:31.440 --> 2:26:33.120]  You have to be able to make predictions.
[2:26:33.120 --> 2:26:35.840]  You have to be able to see what's happened, what's coming.
[2:26:35.840 --> 2:26:37.120]  And at the end of those articles,
[2:26:37.120 --> 2:26:40.840]  you do have to say, hey, look, if this happens,
[2:26:40.840 --> 2:26:43.200]  then this is likely to happen down the line.
[2:26:43.200 --> 2:26:46.320]  If this doesn't happen, what's been discovered in research,
[2:26:46.320 --> 2:26:48.880]  then this is likely to happen on down the line.
[2:26:48.880 --> 2:26:51.240]  So what I said in the board meeting
[2:26:51.240 --> 2:26:54.160]  is even Dr. Mike Eden agreed with me.
[2:26:54.160 --> 2:26:57.840]  I mean, he said, it's possible if not plausible.
[2:26:57.840 --> 2:27:00.840]  So I want people to understand the context
[2:27:00.840 --> 2:27:03.880]  of why I said what I said at the end because that matters.
[2:27:03.880 --> 2:27:05.480]  I'm not worried about Dr. Malone.
[2:27:05.480 --> 2:27:07.400]  He's wishy-washy as far as I'm concerned.
[2:27:07.400 --> 2:27:08.560]  He hasn't taken a hard step in that.
[2:27:08.560 --> 2:27:09.400]  No, but you're right.
[2:27:09.400 --> 2:27:12.080]  This is designed to collapse civilization.
[2:27:12.080 --> 2:27:16.520]  It's a post-industrial plan, signed into global law, 2002,
[2:27:16.520 --> 2:27:20.920]  Rio de Janeiro, Agenda 21, even if 20% gets sick
[2:27:20.920 --> 2:27:23.120]  or 10% die, it collapses civilization.
[2:27:23.120 --> 2:27:25.760]  The evidence from the studies, it's gonna be far higher.
[2:27:25.760 --> 2:27:27.600]  So what you're doing is you're warning them
[2:27:27.600 --> 2:27:30.800]  so they know up front what's about to hit them, right?
[2:27:30.800 --> 2:27:32.200]  It's already happened.
[2:27:32.200 --> 2:27:34.600]  And here's where I noticed it.
[2:27:34.600 --> 2:27:36.280]  And this story came across my radar
[2:27:36.280 --> 2:27:39.400]  on my podcast back in March and I grabbed it and I went,
[2:27:39.400 --> 2:27:40.800]  we need to, I'm gonna read this
[2:27:40.800 --> 2:27:42.480]  and we need to pay attention to this.
[2:27:42.480 --> 2:27:46.520]  Schools in New Hampshire closed back in March.
[2:27:46.520 --> 2:27:48.800]  Entire districts closed for the entire week
[2:27:48.800 --> 2:27:51.080]  because their staff members were all giddy
[2:27:51.080 --> 2:27:53.960]  about getting the jab and they all lined up to get it.
[2:27:53.960 --> 2:27:56.000]  And then hundreds of teachers were out sick
[2:27:56.000 --> 2:27:57.800]  from the initial reactions of the jab.
[2:27:57.800 --> 2:28:00.400]  I remember that, yeah, that's right.
[2:28:00.400 --> 2:28:02.400]  Right, that doesn't mean the jab is working.
[2:28:02.400 --> 2:28:03.920]  It means it's poison.
[2:28:03.920 --> 2:28:07.520]  And that reaction that person has is a poison reaction
[2:28:07.520 --> 2:28:08.920]  that your immune system is saying,
[2:28:08.920 --> 2:28:10.560]  don't do this to me anymore.
[2:28:10.560 --> 2:28:12.320]  This is how I'll make you feel
[2:28:12.320 --> 2:28:13.880]  if you keep doing this to me.
[2:28:13.880 --> 2:28:15.280]  They closed down their schools
[2:28:15.280 --> 2:28:18.800]  and I thought, what are they doing here?
[2:28:18.800 --> 2:28:20.000]  They're not paying attention.
[2:28:20.000 --> 2:28:22.840]  By the way, doc, I know you're mainly an internet TV guy,
[2:28:22.840 --> 2:28:24.600]  which is great, so are we.
[2:28:24.600 --> 2:28:27.640]  But we have 200 affiliates, so we have to stop sometimes.
[2:28:27.640 --> 2:28:28.920]  Put it back on screen.
[2:28:28.920 --> 2:28:31.120]  Doctors not making this up, put it up.
[2:28:31.120 --> 2:28:33.040]  We got mainstream news here.
[2:28:33.040 --> 2:28:35.360]  That's WMUR9, got a bunch of others.
[2:28:35.360 --> 2:28:39.080]  Some NH schools closed Monday
[2:28:39.080 --> 2:28:42.120]  after teachers calling after receiving COVID-19 shots.
[2:28:42.120 --> 2:28:44.280]  And I saw that in Austin.
[2:28:44.280 --> 2:28:45.400]  I saw that in Dallas.
[2:28:45.400 --> 2:28:46.680]  I saw it in Seattle.
[2:28:46.680 --> 2:28:49.000]  Hundreds of articles I'd forgotten about.
[2:28:49.000 --> 2:28:50.520]  I'm glad Dr. Brooks brought that up.
[2:28:50.520 --> 2:28:53.880]  We'll come right back and talk about that on the other side.
[2:28:53.880 --> 2:28:56.200]  Wow, wow, so he didn't make a prediction.
[2:28:56.200 --> 2:28:57.680]  He said it was already happened.
[2:28:57.680 --> 2:28:59.000]  We'll be right back.
[2:28:59.000 --> 2:29:00.520]  If you're concerned about the power grid
[2:29:00.520 --> 2:29:03.800]  and want to generate your own supply of off-grid electricity,
[2:29:03.800 --> 2:29:06.200]  this will be the most important message
[2:29:06.200 --> 2:29:07.400]  you'll hear this year.
[2:29:07.400 --> 2:29:08.440]  Here's why.
[2:29:08.440 --> 2:29:12.320]  We now have a small number of solar generators back in stock.
[2:29:12.320 --> 2:29:14.320]  These emergency backup systems provide
[2:29:14.320 --> 2:29:17.440]  a life-saving backup power when you need it most.
[2:29:17.440 --> 2:29:21.000]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly,
[2:29:21.000 --> 2:29:23.120]  emit no dangerous fumes, and produce
[2:29:23.120 --> 2:29:26.440]  an endless supply of free electricity from the sun.
[2:29:26.440 --> 2:29:29.480]  Whether it's wildfires, dangerous weather, power grid issues,
[2:29:29.480 --> 2:29:31.280]  or just getting off the grid, you'll
[2:29:31.280 --> 2:29:35.080]  never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[2:29:35.080 --> 2:29:37.160]  Even better, all this week, radio listeners
[2:29:37.160 --> 2:29:41.160]  get over $700 in free off-the-grid bonuses, too.
[2:29:41.160 --> 2:29:45.040]  Go to mysolarbackup.com to learn more and check availability.
[2:29:45.040 --> 2:29:47.040]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[2:29:47.040 --> 2:29:49.120]  Look for the free report, Crisis Cooling,
[2:29:49.120 --> 2:29:52.480]  how to make absolutely sure your meat, milk, and medicines
[2:29:52.480 --> 2:29:55.440]  stay safe and cool in any power outage.
[2:29:55.440 --> 2:30:00.200]  Yours free at mysolarbackup.com.
[2:30:00.200 --> 2:30:02.240]  I don't like coming to you and saying
[2:30:02.240 --> 2:30:04.000]  this could be our last broadcast.
[2:30:04.000 --> 2:30:06.280]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years, and only the last year
[2:30:06.280 --> 2:30:07.680]  or so have I said that.
[2:30:07.680 --> 2:30:09.360]  But let me tell you, the new world orders
[2:30:09.360 --> 2:30:10.960]  breathe them down our neck.
[2:30:10.960 --> 2:30:13.080]  The big, globalist publications are coming after us,
[2:30:13.080 --> 2:30:15.320]  and they're doing everything they can to shut us down.
[2:30:15.320 --> 2:30:18.200]  So please pray to keep InfoWars on the air,
[2:30:18.200 --> 2:30:20.280]  and please support the local station you're listening to
[2:30:20.280 --> 2:30:21.080]  as well.
[2:30:21.080 --> 2:30:23.600]  At the same time, go to infowarstore.com
[2:30:23.600 --> 2:30:26.640]  all you still can, and get a book, get a film,
[2:30:26.640 --> 2:30:28.600]  get a t-shirt, get some supplements,
[2:30:28.600 --> 2:30:31.680]  because it's that money that helps us stay on air
[2:30:31.680 --> 2:30:33.160]  in the face of this thing.
[2:30:33.160 --> 2:30:35.280]  I need your help more than ever now.
[2:30:35.280 --> 2:30:36.760]  I want to keep fighting the globalists,
[2:30:36.760 --> 2:30:39.480]  but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[2:30:39.480 --> 2:30:42.480]  So pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks
[2:30:42.480 --> 2:30:44.280]  about the broadcast however you can,
[2:30:44.280 --> 2:30:46.600]  and buy great products that will enrich you
[2:30:46.600 --> 2:30:50.120]  and your family's lives every day at infowarstore.com.

[2:30:52.480 --> 2:30:55.520]  or books or films, all of it nurtures the soul.
[2:30:55.520 --> 2:30:57.120]  All of it empowers humanity.
[2:30:57.120 --> 2:30:59.640]  All of it is pro-human and pro-God.
[2:30:59.640 --> 2:31:00.880]  Thank you so much.
[2:31:00.880 --> 2:31:03.560]  All of the experts agree that getting proper sleep
[2:31:03.560 --> 2:31:05.240]  is the cornerstone of good health.
[2:31:05.240 --> 2:31:07.400]  It has been proven that a poor sleep schedule
[2:31:07.400 --> 2:31:09.440]  is linked with numerous health problems,
[2:31:09.440 --> 2:31:12.840]  including weight gain, memory issues, mood changes,
[2:31:12.840 --> 2:31:15.840]  poor concentration, and even a weakened immune system.
[2:31:15.840 --> 2:31:18.320]  Introducing RocketRest, the new product
[2:31:18.320 --> 2:31:22.080]  from our Dr. Jones Naturals line at infowarstore.com.
[2:31:22.080 --> 2:31:24.040]  The new RocketRest formula is loaded

[2:31:28.200 --> 2:31:30.600]  but help you wake up feeling refreshed.
[2:31:30.600 --> 2:31:33.000]  Many competitors' sleep formulas focus
[2:31:33.000 --> 2:31:34.480]  only on getting you to sleep,
[2:31:34.480 --> 2:31:37.000]  but RocketRest was specifically formulated
[2:31:37.000 --> 2:31:40.680]  to help you feel rested and ready to take on the next day.
[2:31:40.680 --> 2:31:43.600]  It uses a unique quick release capsule system
[2:31:43.600 --> 2:31:46.600]  to ensure fast delivery of deep sleep support ingredients
[2:31:46.600 --> 2:31:48.520]  like melatonin and magnesium.
[2:31:48.520 --> 2:31:50.680]  RocketRest helps you fall asleep fast,
[2:31:50.680 --> 2:31:53.160]  stay asleep, and wake up feeling rested.

[2:32:01.080 --> 2:32:04.800]  Not all vitamin and mineral supplements are equal.
[2:32:04.800 --> 2:32:05.920]  Many of them are synthetic.
[2:32:05.920 --> 2:32:07.840]  Many of them have fillers and additives.
[2:32:07.840 --> 2:32:10.920]  Many of them just pass right to the body and are not absorbed.
[2:32:10.920 --> 2:32:13.960]  Well, that's not the case with our incredibly popular,
[2:32:13.960 --> 2:32:15.960]  because it's so effective product
[2:32:15.960 --> 2:32:17.600]  that it's not been sold out for months,
[2:32:17.600 --> 2:32:19.800]  but it's finally back in stock.
[2:32:19.800 --> 2:32:22.200]  And that is vitamin, mineral fusion,
[2:32:22.200 --> 2:32:25.320]  all the essential vitamins, all the essential minerals,
[2:32:25.320 --> 2:32:27.920]  a bunch of chiamino acids to help it upload better
[2:32:27.920 --> 2:32:29.400]  into your body and your cells.
[2:32:29.400 --> 2:32:31.600]  It's in powder form, it's great for children,
[2:32:31.600 --> 2:32:33.680]  it's great for adults, it's really important
[2:32:33.680 --> 2:32:35.040]  for folks that are older,
[2:32:35.040 --> 2:32:37.080]  because they don't absorb as well through their guts,
[2:32:37.080 --> 2:32:39.560]  so this liquid formula really, really does it.
[2:32:39.560 --> 2:32:41.920]  You mix up a picture of it every couple of days,
[2:32:41.920 --> 2:32:44.800]  put it in the refrigerator, keep it out in the kitchen,
[2:32:44.800 --> 2:32:46.200]  and just remember to drink it in the morning
[2:32:46.200 --> 2:32:47.200]  and in the evening.
[2:32:47.200 --> 2:32:49.560]  It tastes great, it makes your body healthy,
[2:32:49.560 --> 2:32:51.160]  it boosts your immune system,
[2:32:51.160 --> 2:32:53.400]  and it funds the info war.
[2:32:53.400 --> 2:32:56.400]  A true 360 win, so vitamin, mineral fusion,
[2:32:56.400 --> 2:32:58.960]  sold out for months, it's back in stock for a limited time,
[2:32:58.960 --> 2:33:00.800]  33% off infowarstore.com.
[2:33:02.880 --> 2:33:05.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:33:05.960 --> 2:33:14.760]  3
[2:33:14.760 --> 2:33:20.520]  4
[2:33:20.520 --> 2:33:23.280]  battling for a pro-human future
[2:33:23.280 --> 2:33:26.640]  against the eugenics, the population is globalist.
[2:33:26.640 --> 2:33:28.400]  Welcome back, I'm your host, Alex Jones,
[2:33:28.400 --> 2:33:31.840]  massive news has broken since we got our guest on,
[2:33:31.840 --> 2:33:33.060]  let me mentioned some of it.
[2:33:33.060 --> 2:33:36.580]  We'll get his take on it and get back to the huge information.
[2:33:36.580 --> 2:33:39.420]  He was just laying out.
[2:33:39.420 --> 2:33:41.140]  Adon Salazar has the article.
[2:33:41.140 --> 2:33:42.940]  It's on infowars.com.
[2:33:42.940 --> 2:33:46.420]  It links right to the Israeli government's own announcement.
[2:33:46.420 --> 2:33:48.500]  Remember, Israel and Australia are the cutting edge
[2:33:48.500 --> 2:33:50.060]  of what's coming here next.
[2:33:50.060 --> 2:33:55.060]  Israel to grant green passports to fly and travel
[2:33:56.100 --> 2:33:59.980]  and go in restaurants, Israel to grant green passports
[2:33:59.980 --> 2:34:04.420]  only to a triple vaccinated.
[2:34:04.420 --> 2:34:05.260]  That's how it works.
[2:34:05.260 --> 2:34:06.580]  Oh, maybe the vaccine working.
[2:34:06.580 --> 2:34:09.340]  Oh, you got to take a third one recommended.
[2:34:09.340 --> 2:34:11.140]  Oh, now you've got to take it.
[2:34:11.140 --> 2:34:12.900]  And then a fourth, and a fifth, and a sixth,
[2:34:12.900 --> 2:34:14.780]  and a 10th, and a 20th.
[2:34:14.780 --> 2:34:16.100]  Unbelievable.
[2:34:16.100 --> 2:34:18.820]  Study, why are so many vaccinated people getting sick?
[2:34:18.820 --> 2:34:20.860]  Antibody dependent enhancement.
[2:34:20.860 --> 2:34:22.380]  We'll talk about that with our guests in a minute,
[2:34:22.380 --> 2:34:23.220]  but look at this.
[2:34:23.220 --> 2:34:28.220]  Pfizer shot just 39% effective against Delta infection,
[2:34:28.300 --> 2:34:29.860]  which is the majority of the infections.
[2:34:29.860 --> 2:34:32.420]  Forbes, that's their excuse to get around the fact
[2:34:32.420 --> 2:34:33.820]  it doesn't work.
[2:34:33.820 --> 2:34:36.220]  Bloomberg says, oh, looks like people get even sicker
[2:34:36.220 --> 2:34:37.180]  than the other vaccine.
[2:34:37.180 --> 2:34:39.940]  The answer, more vaccines, and now that's today.
[2:34:39.940 --> 2:34:42.700]  Pfizer's CEO, same guy says he won't take it,
[2:34:42.700 --> 2:34:43.980]  says he doesn't need to.
[2:34:43.980 --> 2:34:45.660]  I'm not kidding, I have a clip of it.
[2:34:45.660 --> 2:34:50.060]  Says COVID-19 vaccine resistant variant likely to emerge.
[2:34:50.060 --> 2:34:53.380]  So he tells you after the fact his cover story,
[2:34:55.060 --> 2:34:56.940]  so that I guess their stock stays up,
[2:34:56.940 --> 2:34:59.220]  which of course it will stay up
[2:34:59.220 --> 2:35:01.580]  because it's all based on a giant fraud
[2:35:01.580 --> 2:35:03.620]  of making you take more all the time
[2:35:03.620 --> 2:35:05.540]  as it destroys your immune system
[2:35:05.540 --> 2:35:08.380]  and renders you basically totally dependent on them.
[2:35:08.380 --> 2:35:11.540]  And here it is, vaccines could drive the evolution
[2:35:11.540 --> 2:35:15.740]  of more COVID-19 mutants, which it did, NPR.
[2:35:15.740 --> 2:35:17.660]  And it goes on from there.
[2:35:17.660 --> 2:35:19.780]  And our guests mentioned this.
[2:35:19.780 --> 2:35:22.860]  Let's back him up, I'd forgotten about this.
[2:35:22.860 --> 2:35:24.700]  This is out of a Concord monitor.
[2:35:24.700 --> 2:35:26.900]  Newly vaccinated teachers report side effects.
[2:35:26.900 --> 2:35:29.380]  Schools closed because so many were ill.
[2:35:29.380 --> 2:35:31.340]  Some New Hampshire schools closed
[2:35:31.340 --> 2:35:33.740]  after vaccinated teachers call in sick
[2:35:33.740 --> 2:35:36.820]  after receiving their shots.
[2:35:36.820 --> 2:35:39.780]  Emergency, the FDA now calls more and more drugs,
[2:35:39.780 --> 2:35:43.060]  not just dangerous, but they give death warnings.
[2:35:44.060 --> 2:35:49.060]  All right, going back to Dr. Sean M. Brooks, PhD,
[2:35:49.300 --> 2:35:52.500]  who spoke out at his alma mater there in Ohio
[2:35:52.500 --> 2:35:57.460]  and went viral, you had left off there with warning
[2:35:57.460 --> 2:35:58.580]  that schools are gonna be crippled.
[2:35:58.580 --> 2:35:59.740]  Everybody's gonna be crippled by this
[2:35:59.740 --> 2:36:01.620]  and that being the plan.
[2:36:01.620 --> 2:36:02.460]  Continue with that.
[2:36:02.460 --> 2:36:05.300]  And would you like to comment on what we knew was coming
[2:36:05.300 --> 2:36:07.220]  that, oh, guess what?
[2:36:07.220 --> 2:36:09.060]  There'll be monthly shots basically
[2:36:09.060 --> 2:36:10.660]  with your new vaccine passports.
[2:36:13.220 --> 2:36:16.020]  Yeah, that's not surprising.
[2:36:16.020 --> 2:36:17.300]  I mean, this was written about
[2:36:17.300 --> 2:36:19.660]  and spoken about over a year ago.
[2:36:19.660 --> 2:36:22.860]  And, you know, I, again, back in March,
[2:36:22.860 --> 2:36:25.260]  I tossed up an article for the first time
[2:36:25.260 --> 2:36:27.460]  on American thinker and they accepted it
[2:36:27.460 --> 2:36:30.700]  and I said, homeschooling is going to dramatically increase
[2:36:30.700 --> 2:36:31.780]  here in the future.
[2:36:31.780 --> 2:36:35.540]  And there cannot be a bigger green flag
[2:36:35.540 --> 2:36:38.780]  for families to run toward homeschooling
[2:36:38.780 --> 2:36:40.580]  and find these outlets.
[2:36:40.580 --> 2:36:42.580]  And just very quickly, I'd like to mention a few
[2:36:42.580 --> 2:36:45.940]  because again, homeschooling and hating on homeschooling
[2:36:45.940 --> 2:36:48.140]  is pure propaganda.
[2:36:48.140 --> 2:36:51.260]  That's exactly what it is, it's designed to keep people
[2:36:51.260 --> 2:36:53.420]  attached to the K-12 environment
[2:36:53.420 --> 2:36:56.300]  and not have a free mind and think for themselves.
[2:36:56.300 --> 2:36:58.620]  So I'm not a paid spokesperson for these websites,
[2:36:58.620 --> 2:37:00.900]  but there's two of them that I recommend.
[2:37:00.900 --> 2:37:03.380]  Abeka.com is one of them
[2:37:03.380 --> 2:37:06.460]  and CalvertEducation.com is another.
[2:37:06.460 --> 2:37:08.580]  I highly recommend people look into these.
[2:37:08.580 --> 2:37:09.900]  I've had guests on my channel.
[2:37:09.900 --> 2:37:11.540]  Sure, we're gonna see a giant exodus.
[2:37:11.540 --> 2:37:13.820]  The whole future is gonna be freedom.
[2:37:13.820 --> 2:37:15.700]  The whole future is people are gonna figure out
[2:37:15.700 --> 2:37:17.980]  building our own civilization, our own society.
[2:37:17.980 --> 2:37:20.140]  The people need to start striking out now.
[2:37:21.780 --> 2:37:24.820]  Yeah, and it's the K-12 environments, of course,
[2:37:24.820 --> 2:37:26.660]  that are doing it themselves.
[2:37:26.660 --> 2:37:28.980]  They're destroying their own environment
[2:37:28.980 --> 2:37:31.700]  and they don't seem to know nor care.
[2:37:31.700 --> 2:37:33.940]  And they're taking a lot of good people with them,
[2:37:33.940 --> 2:37:34.900]  which is a shame.
[2:37:34.900 --> 2:37:36.740]  There's a lot of great non-teaching staff
[2:37:36.740 --> 2:37:38.140]  that work in these buildings
[2:37:38.140 --> 2:37:39.500]  that have their heads on straight
[2:37:39.500 --> 2:37:41.780]  and they're seeing what's happening and they don't like it.
[2:37:41.780 --> 2:37:44.900]  And I have always advocated for those individuals as well.
[2:37:44.900 --> 2:37:46.380]  The same thing is true with teachers.
[2:37:46.380 --> 2:37:48.620]  There are some teachers that are awake.
[2:37:48.620 --> 2:37:49.940]  They're fully awake.
[2:37:49.940 --> 2:37:52.660]  And then there are others that are just blind to all of it.
[2:37:52.660 --> 2:37:56.180]  And again, everybody saw the clip of the Utah teacher
[2:37:56.180 --> 2:37:58.900]  who got fired for popping off in her classroom.
[2:37:58.900 --> 2:38:02.140]  Everything she said is a fireable offense
[2:38:02.140 --> 2:38:04.780]  and everything that they're doing, and this is big,
[2:38:04.780 --> 2:38:07.420]  everything that all of these school boards
[2:38:07.420 --> 2:38:10.380]  and administrators and school teachers have done
[2:38:10.380 --> 2:38:12.380]  over the last year now,
[2:38:12.380 --> 2:38:14.260]  unless they've rewritten their contracts
[2:38:14.260 --> 2:38:17.340]  to allow child abuse or they've rewritten the terms
[2:38:17.340 --> 2:38:20.500]  of their, you know, the terms of their agreements
[2:38:20.500 --> 2:38:22.260]  to include all of this abuse,
[2:38:22.260 --> 2:38:25.940]  if this were done back in 2019, they'd all be fired.
[2:38:25.940 --> 2:38:28.220]  And I know the process of how that all works.
[2:38:28.220 --> 2:38:30.380]  They'd be placed on administrative leave.
[2:38:30.380 --> 2:38:32.100]  If there were to walk into a classroom,
[2:38:32.100 --> 2:38:35.140]  see shower curtains hanging up in between people's desks,
[2:38:35.140 --> 2:38:37.980]  wearing masks, they would say, what are you doing?
[2:38:37.980 --> 2:38:41.660]  Well, Texas law, Texas law says making a child wear a mask
[2:38:41.660 --> 2:38:43.980]  is a form of cruel and unusual punishment.
[2:38:43.980 --> 2:38:45.940]  You can't make prisoners do that
[2:38:45.940 --> 2:38:47.620]  unless they've attacked people or whatever.
[2:38:47.620 --> 2:38:49.340]  So yeah, this is all illegal.
[2:38:50.300 --> 2:38:51.780]  Completely.
[2:38:51.780 --> 2:38:54.140]  And it's being sanctioned and it's 100% allowed.
[2:38:54.140 --> 2:38:55.460]  Have you seen the schools in Georgia
[2:38:55.460 --> 2:38:57.660]  where they can't talk or they're expelled?
[2:38:57.660 --> 2:38:59.900]  So now they say, don't look at each other or talk.
[2:38:59.900 --> 2:39:01.540]  It's like cult members where they walk around
[2:39:01.540 --> 2:39:02.580]  not even talking.
[2:39:05.060 --> 2:39:07.180]  I haven't, but I don't doubt it.
[2:39:07.180 --> 2:39:11.060]  And the imagery alone should shake anybody to the core.
[2:39:11.060 --> 2:39:13.060]  The second that I started to see that,
[2:39:13.060 --> 2:39:15.700]  I thought they've crossed the bridge,
[2:39:15.700 --> 2:39:16.980]  they've crossed the line,
[2:39:16.980 --> 2:39:20.100]  and they're not gonna go back to anything else anymore.
[2:39:20.100 --> 2:39:21.700]  They've played their hand.
[2:39:21.700 --> 2:39:25.460]  They've shown everyone what an abusive environment they are.
[2:39:25.460 --> 2:39:26.820]  Now, is it happening everywhere?
[2:39:26.820 --> 2:39:28.380]  No, there are private schools
[2:39:28.380 --> 2:39:30.780]  that are shielding their students and their staff
[2:39:30.780 --> 2:39:33.620]  from everything that's going on and God bless them.
[2:39:33.620 --> 2:39:35.900]  We also know that there are private schools
[2:39:35.900 --> 2:39:37.780]  that are demanding everybody get jabbed.
[2:39:37.780 --> 2:39:41.460]  There was a Tennessee school that did that a few months ago.
[2:39:41.460 --> 2:39:44.100]  I brought that up on my podcast.
[2:39:44.100 --> 2:39:46.260]  I played the guy's audio who runs the school.
[2:39:46.260 --> 2:39:48.420]  I mean, he sounded not well.
[2:39:48.420 --> 2:39:50.580]  And these people aren't well.
[2:39:50.580 --> 2:39:52.700]  These are all abusive tactics.
[2:39:52.700 --> 2:39:54.620]  They're all being normalized.
[2:39:54.620 --> 2:39:57.300]  And it's being normalized generationally, of course,
[2:39:57.300 --> 2:39:59.500]  as many of us know for the sole purpose
[2:39:59.500 --> 2:40:01.180]  of creating a generation of people
[2:40:01.180 --> 2:40:03.260]  that can easily be controlled down the line
[2:40:03.260 --> 2:40:05.180]  if the jabs don't get them first.
[2:40:06.940 --> 2:40:09.020]  So how do we fight back against this?
[2:40:09.020 --> 2:40:11.060]  Obviously get people out of school
[2:40:11.060 --> 2:40:12.380]  through the school, say no,
[2:40:12.380 --> 2:40:14.100]  go speak at school board meetings.
[2:40:15.580 --> 2:40:16.420]  I mean, what do we do?
[2:40:16.420 --> 2:40:18.700]  Because it's just all out in the open now.
[2:40:19.660 --> 2:40:22.540]  I don't think that speaking at school board meetings
[2:40:22.540 --> 2:40:24.540]  is going to do the trick anymore.
[2:40:24.540 --> 2:40:27.180]  I've commented on that on my podcast.
[2:40:27.180 --> 2:40:28.900]  Well, I'm not saying it does the trick,
[2:40:28.900 --> 2:40:32.180]  but that people like school board, city councils,
[2:40:32.180 --> 2:40:33.580]  those go viral.
[2:40:33.580 --> 2:40:35.740]  So if somebody gets 100,000 views,
[2:40:35.740 --> 2:40:38.340]  not just what's seen locally, that helps others.
[2:40:38.340 --> 2:40:40.620]  I think this is one of the few venues actually
[2:40:40.620 --> 2:40:42.660]  where media is getting out to a larger group.
[2:40:42.660 --> 2:40:44.340]  I get you're saying it doesn't help the school board
[2:40:44.340 --> 2:40:45.780]  because they're arrogant and don't care.
[2:40:45.780 --> 2:40:49.100]  But I'm saying as a venue to get it out, it's working.
[2:40:49.100 --> 2:40:51.740]  Yes, I'm certain it's waking people up as it should,
[2:40:51.740 --> 2:40:53.460]  which is why I said what I said.
[2:40:53.460 --> 2:40:55.980]  They aren't thinking about what they're doing
[2:40:55.980 --> 2:40:58.140]  when it comes to putting their own staff members
[2:40:58.140 --> 2:40:59.740]  in harm's way.
[2:40:59.740 --> 2:41:01.620]  They've already abused children.
[2:41:01.620 --> 2:41:03.820]  And they've already tried to normalize that among parents
[2:41:03.820 --> 2:41:06.220]  so much so that you have parents now abusing
[2:41:06.220 --> 2:41:08.540]  their own children and thinking that it's normal.
[2:41:08.540 --> 2:41:10.180]  And they're not calling it abuse, of course.
[2:41:10.180 --> 2:41:12.060]  They're saying it's under the guise of health.
[2:41:12.060 --> 2:41:14.260]  It's not helping them.
[2:41:14.260 --> 2:41:16.580]  It's, there you go, like that imagery right there.
[2:41:16.580 --> 2:41:17.980]  I have that in my last book.
[2:41:17.980 --> 2:41:19.740]  That was insane.
[2:41:19.740 --> 2:41:23.580]  That imagery of those, I believe that Washington state of
[2:41:23.580 --> 2:41:25.380]  man. This is what you would see in the most radical cults.
[2:41:25.380 --> 2:41:26.380]  That's right.
[2:41:26.380 --> 2:41:27.460]  It's nuts.
[2:41:27.460 --> 2:41:30.780]  And if a band teacher were doing that in 2019,
[2:41:30.780 --> 2:41:32.100]  they'd be fired.
[2:41:32.100 --> 2:41:35.140]  I watched a school teacher get fired for making students
[2:41:35.140 --> 2:41:39.340]  go to the bathroom while wearing a construction vest
[2:41:39.340 --> 2:41:41.420]  as a hall pass.
[2:41:41.420 --> 2:41:43.780]  They were fired like that for doing that.
[2:41:43.780 --> 2:41:45.340]  But this is okay.
[2:41:45.340 --> 2:41:46.900]  No, it's not okay.
[2:41:46.900 --> 2:41:47.740]  They've jumped the show.
[2:41:47.740 --> 2:41:50.660]  The system is training us to be humiliated
[2:41:50.660 --> 2:41:53.060]  and dominated and controlled.
[2:41:53.060 --> 2:41:54.020]  Completely.
[2:41:54.020 --> 2:41:56.820]  And homeschooling parents and homeschooling students
[2:41:56.820 --> 2:41:59.500]  and families are laughing their tails off right now.
[2:41:59.500 --> 2:42:01.380]  But they're compassionate people, too.
[2:42:01.380 --> 2:42:03.820]  And they're very sad with what's going on.
[2:42:03.820 --> 2:42:04.980]  And I'm certain that they are.
[2:42:04.980 --> 2:42:06.020]  Well, it does not make no mistake.
[2:42:06.020 --> 2:42:08.340]  Once the globalists from the colleges
[2:42:08.340 --> 2:42:10.780]  taking over all the schools, the public schools,
[2:42:10.780 --> 2:42:11.820]  they're going to come take over.
[2:42:11.820 --> 2:42:13.100]  They're coming for everybody.
[2:42:13.100 --> 2:42:15.700]  So people better know, this is a total takeover plan.
[2:42:15.700 --> 2:42:18.580]  So folks shouldn't be confident just because they live
[2:42:18.580 --> 2:42:20.940]  in the middle of Montana or Oklahoma
[2:42:20.940 --> 2:42:22.460]  and all your neighbors are awake and stuff.
[2:42:22.460 --> 2:42:23.300]  That's great.
[2:42:23.300 --> 2:42:25.740]  But believe me, the globalists are coming for you next.
[2:42:27.060 --> 2:42:31.180]  And the local city councils have their hooks in school boards
[2:42:31.180 --> 2:42:33.300]  and they have their hooks in universities.
[2:42:33.300 --> 2:42:37.700]  Our local city council was upset that Miami University
[2:42:37.700 --> 2:42:40.700]  would not mandate the jabs for all of their staff
[2:42:40.700 --> 2:42:42.020]  and all of their students.
[2:42:42.020 --> 2:42:43.460]  And Miami University said, look,
[2:42:43.460 --> 2:42:45.220]  we're not going to do that at least right now.
[2:42:45.220 --> 2:42:48.100]  But Miami University right now is mandating masks
[2:42:48.100 --> 2:42:50.500]  for everybody, regardless of their quote unquote,
[2:42:50.500 --> 2:42:54.940]  vaccine status, as are the vast majority of colleges
[2:42:54.940 --> 2:42:55.780]  in Ohio.
[2:42:55.780 --> 2:42:56.940]  That's the symbol of slavery.
[2:42:58.900 --> 2:43:03.100]  Humanity is the main stakeholder on this plan.
[2:43:03.100 --> 2:43:04.660]  But the big corporations for 100 years
[2:43:04.660 --> 2:43:06.620]  have told us that humans are bad and evil
[2:43:06.620 --> 2:43:07.820]  and the pest wants on the earth
[2:43:07.820 --> 2:43:09.740]  so that we begin to believe we're bad
[2:43:09.740 --> 2:43:11.300]  and we'll turn off our life force
[2:43:11.300 --> 2:43:13.380]  and let the eugenics-based globalists
[2:43:13.380 --> 2:43:14.900]  take control of the planet.
[2:43:14.900 --> 2:43:16.140]  If you go to Klaus Schwab,
[2:43:16.140 --> 2:43:18.700]  the Heather Davis Group's own Wikipedia page,
[2:43:18.700 --> 2:43:22.140]  he brags on there about how they're capturing democracy
[2:43:22.140 --> 2:43:24.540]  and taking over governments worldwide
[2:43:24.540 --> 2:43:27.140]  to set up a corporate dictatorship under the UN.
[2:43:27.140 --> 2:43:29.420]  They admit all of this.
[2:43:29.420 --> 2:43:30.700]  They plan the lockdowns.
[2:43:30.700 --> 2:43:32.380]  They release the viruses.
[2:43:32.380 --> 2:43:34.100]  They think you're stupid.
[2:43:34.100 --> 2:43:36.060]  And their plan is to slowly cut off
[2:43:36.060 --> 2:43:39.300]  the resources so they can dictate total social control
[2:43:39.300 --> 2:43:40.740]  over you and your lives.
[2:43:40.740 --> 2:43:43.740]  That's how I was able to predict everything they did
[2:43:43.740 --> 2:43:45.860]  decades before they executed it,
[2:43:45.860 --> 2:43:48.700]  word for word, with total precision,
[2:43:48.700 --> 2:43:51.300]  because they have a detailed battle plan.
[2:43:51.300 --> 2:43:53.860]  We cover it live weekdays, 11 a.m. at 3 p.m.
[2:43:53.860 --> 2:43:55.980]  at infowars.com, four slash show.
[2:43:55.980 --> 2:43:58.420]  Tell everybody to tune in now and war the world.
[2:44:00.860 --> 2:44:02.660]  What are champions made of?
[2:44:02.660 --> 2:44:05.940]  Here's a man who can show you.
[2:44:05.940 --> 2:44:06.820]  Argh!
[2:44:10.740 --> 2:44:10.980]  No.

[2:44:15.580 --> 2:44:17.060]  Is the Infoverstore hotline?
[2:44:17.060 --> 2:44:18.780]  Trouble-A 253-3139, Trouble-A 253-3139,
[2:44:18.780 --> 2:44:20.460]  Trouble-A 253-3139, Trouble-A 353-3139,

[2:44:21.820 --> 2:44:23.580]  Is the Infoverstore hotline?
[2:44:23.580 --> 2:44:27.340]  Trouble-A 253-3139, Is the Infoverstore hotline?
[2:44:27.340 --> 2:44:29.060]  Trouble-A 253-3139,
[2:44:29.060 --> 2:44:30.700]  Is the Infoverstore hotline?
[2:44:30.700 --> 2:44:58.700]  That's infowarps.store.com.
[2:45:00.700 --> 2:45:03.700]  Let's go back in time, say, to the mid-1990s.
[2:45:03.700 --> 2:45:06.700]  And then imagine a science fiction movie set in the year 2020,
[2:45:06.700 --> 2:45:08.700]  where a world government's being established,
[2:45:08.700 --> 2:45:11.700]  where members of Congress and former presidents
[2:45:11.700 --> 2:45:13.700]  are censured by big tech,
[2:45:13.700 --> 2:45:16.700]  and where if you don't take an experimental injection
[2:45:16.700 --> 2:45:19.700]  that grows blood clots and prions all over your body,
[2:45:19.700 --> 2:45:23.700]  then you're not allowed to fly on an airplane.
[2:45:23.700 --> 2:45:26.700]  Think about that, because that's where we are.
[2:45:26.700 --> 2:45:29.700]  Imagine just 20, 30 years ago, tell us, just five years ago,
[2:45:29.700 --> 2:45:32.700]  if somebody told you this would be happening.
[2:45:32.700 --> 2:45:34.700]  But it is happening now.
[2:45:34.700 --> 2:45:36.700]  And then they tell you, oh, sorry,
[2:45:36.700 --> 2:45:38.700]  it's not a vaccine, it's a gene therapy,
[2:45:38.700 --> 2:45:39.700]  and it doesn't really work,
[2:45:39.700 --> 2:45:41.700]  so you got to take it every few months.
[2:45:41.700 --> 2:45:43.700]  And the people that have submitted say, great,
[2:45:43.700 --> 2:45:45.700]  I want to take it all the time
[2:45:45.700 --> 2:45:47.700]  so I can go outside and not get sick from COVID,
[2:45:47.700 --> 2:45:49.700]  even though it gets you sick from COVID.
[2:45:49.700 --> 2:45:51.700]  And now there's record numbers of really sick people
[2:45:51.700 --> 2:45:54.700]  from the sloughing, the shedding of the virus.
[2:45:54.700 --> 2:45:56.700]  And that's in mainline studies.
[2:45:56.700 --> 2:45:58.700]  Bill Gates and Fauci did this,
[2:45:58.700 --> 2:46:00.700]  and they're in prison for it right now.
[2:46:28.700 --> 2:46:30.700]  It's in powder form, it's great for children,
[2:46:30.700 --> 2:46:32.700]  it's great for adults, it's really important
[2:46:32.700 --> 2:46:34.700]  for folks that are older,
[2:46:34.700 --> 2:46:36.700]  because they don't absorb as well through their guts,
[2:46:36.700 --> 2:46:38.700]  so this liquid formula really, really does it.
[2:46:38.700 --> 2:46:40.700]  You mix up a picture of it every couple days,
[2:46:40.700 --> 2:46:43.700]  put it in the refrigerator, keep it out in the kitchen,
[2:46:43.700 --> 2:46:45.700]  and just remember to drink it in the morning
[2:46:45.700 --> 2:46:46.700]  and in the evening.
[2:46:46.700 --> 2:46:48.700]  It tastes great, it makes your body healthy,
[2:46:48.700 --> 2:46:50.700]  it boosts your immune system,
[2:46:50.700 --> 2:46:52.700]  and it funds the info war.
[2:46:52.700 --> 2:46:54.700]  A true 360 win.
[2:46:54.700 --> 2:46:56.700]  So bottom mineral fusion sold out for months,
[2:46:56.700 --> 2:46:58.700]  back in stock for a limited time,
[2:46:58.700 --> 2:47:00.700]  33% off in FullWareStore.com.
[2:47:01.700 --> 2:47:04.700]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:47:17.700 --> 2:47:19.700]  We are back live.
[2:47:19.700 --> 2:47:21.700]  Oh, and Shroyers will be popping in about 15 minutes
[2:47:21.700 --> 2:47:22.700]  to the next hour.
[2:47:22.700 --> 2:47:25.700]  I've got a ton of news and information we haven't hit yet.
[2:47:25.700 --> 2:47:28.700]  We're gonna be going over with them, including,
[2:47:28.700 --> 2:47:31.700]  did I call President Trump a dumbass?
[2:47:31.700 --> 2:47:34.700]  No, I said, I think Trump's really smart.
[2:47:34.700 --> 2:47:37.700]  Why is he saying that the vaccines work?
[2:47:37.700 --> 2:47:39.700]  Why is he saying he took it and it's great
[2:47:39.700 --> 2:47:41.700]  if it doesn't work, he'll tell us.
[2:47:41.700 --> 2:47:43.700]  When I just showed you, and it's been out for days,
[2:47:43.700 --> 2:47:46.700]  that Pfizer says it's a 39% efficacy rate,
[2:47:46.700 --> 2:47:48.700]  and now the head of Pfizer says,
[2:47:48.700 --> 2:47:50.700]  oh, new variants are here and his vaccine doesn't work,
[2:47:50.700 --> 2:47:52.700]  but don't worry, he's got new ones.
[2:47:52.700 --> 2:47:55.700]  And Trump had just said days before he said that
[2:47:55.700 --> 2:47:58.700]  in Alabama on Friday,
[2:47:58.700 --> 2:48:01.700]  Trump had said it looks like a scan by Pfizer
[2:48:01.700 --> 2:48:03.700]  with these boosters.
[2:48:03.700 --> 2:48:05.700]  So I said, you're smart, Trump.
[2:48:05.700 --> 2:48:07.700]  I don't think you're dumb, but maybe you are.
[2:48:07.700 --> 2:48:08.700]  Yeah, I stand by that.
[2:48:08.700 --> 2:48:09.700]  That's BS.
[2:48:09.700 --> 2:48:12.700]  It's not effective if it lowers your immunity already
[2:48:12.700 --> 2:48:14.700]  and it's now 39%.
[2:48:15.700 --> 2:48:18.700]  But the media spends it like Jones leaving the singing ship,
[2:48:18.700 --> 2:48:20.700]  Jones running from Trump.
[2:48:20.700 --> 2:48:23.700]  I've always criticized Trump when he's wrong.
[2:48:25.700 --> 2:48:27.700]  Not on some Trump cult bandwagon.
[2:48:27.700 --> 2:48:29.700]  I support President Trump as he stood up to China
[2:48:29.700 --> 2:48:32.700]  and defended our borders and I think he means well,
[2:48:32.700 --> 2:48:35.700]  but he's also known to be pigheaded.
[2:48:37.700 --> 2:48:38.700]  And he got lied to.
[2:48:38.700 --> 2:48:40.700]  The sign is like, oh, this will fix it, sir,
[2:48:40.700 --> 2:48:42.700]  but it wasn't really a vaccine like they were saying.
[2:48:42.700 --> 2:48:45.700]  So he got conned and he wanted him and he's wrong.
[2:48:45.700 --> 2:48:48.700]  And so I'm going to go after him for it.
[2:48:48.700 --> 2:48:50.700]  That's the way it works.
[2:48:52.700 --> 2:48:55.700]  Let me get Dr. Sean M. Brooks, Ph.D.'s take on this,
[2:48:55.700 --> 2:48:57.700]  AmericanEducationFM.com.
[2:48:57.700 --> 2:48:59.700]  I know you're mainly focused on education
[2:48:59.700 --> 2:49:00.700]  and the great viral speech you gave
[2:49:00.700 --> 2:49:02.700]  and it's all backed up by evidence,
[2:49:02.700 --> 2:49:05.700]  but how big a deal is this to have Pfizer say,
[2:49:05.700 --> 2:49:06.700]  okay, the vaccine doesn't work,
[2:49:06.700 --> 2:49:08.700]  but don't worry, I got new ones for you every month.
[2:49:08.700 --> 2:49:10.700]  I mean, you could see the Bill Gates of them
[2:49:10.700 --> 2:49:12.700]  said this a year and a half ago as you were saying earlier.
[2:49:12.700 --> 2:49:18.700]  This has been the business model all along.
[2:49:18.700 --> 2:49:22.700]  If people can't see the inconsistencies,
[2:49:22.700 --> 2:49:24.700]  I'm not sure that they can be helped,
[2:49:24.700 --> 2:49:27.700]  which is again why I said what I said.
[2:49:27.700 --> 2:49:29.700]  This was a room with individuals.
[2:49:29.700 --> 2:49:31.700]  The vast majority in that school board meeting
[2:49:31.700 --> 2:49:34.700]  were patriots without a doubt.
[2:49:34.700 --> 2:49:36.700]  They were all behind me and to my right
[2:49:36.700 --> 2:49:39.700]  and they made up the majority of the room.
[2:49:39.700 --> 2:49:43.700]  And for the most part, they know what's going on.
[2:49:43.700 --> 2:49:46.700]  The message was for the school board members
[2:49:46.700 --> 2:49:48.700]  as a shot over the bow.
[2:49:48.700 --> 2:49:51.700]  Like that individual right there that you're showing,
[2:49:51.700 --> 2:49:54.700]  he was talking about how he's moving to Montana with his kids.
[2:49:54.700 --> 2:49:56.700]  He's out, he's done.
[2:49:56.700 --> 2:49:58.700]  And there were a lot of people like that.
[2:49:58.700 --> 2:49:59.700]  They said they've had enough.
[2:49:59.700 --> 2:50:02.700]  Another individual stood up in that board meeting after I spoke
[2:50:02.700 --> 2:50:05.700]  and I went home after I spoke because I didn't want to get killed.
[2:50:05.700 --> 2:50:07.700]  But I went home after I spoke
[2:50:07.700 --> 2:50:09.700]  the entire thing from beginning to end.
[2:50:09.700 --> 2:50:12.700]  And another individual stood up
[2:50:12.700 --> 2:50:14.700]  and had the law in their hands.
[2:50:14.700 --> 2:50:16.700]  And they said, you're felons.
[2:50:16.700 --> 2:50:18.700]  You're all felons now.
[2:50:18.700 --> 2:50:20.700]  Because you've mandated the mask
[2:50:20.700 --> 2:50:22.700]  and the mask in Ohio is considered a medical device
[2:50:22.700 --> 2:50:25.700]  and this breaks countless laws.
[2:50:25.700 --> 2:50:26.700]  So now you're all felons.
[2:50:26.700 --> 2:50:28.700]  And it's in one ear and out the other.
[2:50:28.700 --> 2:50:31.700]  I mean, it's always going to be with most school board members
[2:50:31.700 --> 2:50:33.700]  because that comes with the territory
[2:50:33.700 --> 2:50:35.700]  and that's the personality type.
[2:50:35.700 --> 2:50:38.700]  And they follow orders and they follow them.
[2:50:38.700 --> 2:50:40.700]  And those orders come from the top down
[2:50:40.700 --> 2:50:43.700]  and they're all being squeezed and they're all being paid.
[2:50:43.700 --> 2:50:45.700]  These are not independent school districts.
[2:50:45.700 --> 2:50:48.700]  How do we ever get back to them being independent school districts?
[2:50:48.700 --> 2:50:50.700]  You can't.
[2:50:50.700 --> 2:50:53.700]  Well, even if they're independent,
[2:50:53.700 --> 2:50:55.700]  they're still receiving files.
[2:50:55.700 --> 2:50:57.700]  No, no, I get it. They have independent in the name,
[2:50:57.700 --> 2:50:59.700]  but they're not independent.
[2:50:59.700 --> 2:51:01.700]  Right, that's correct.
[2:51:01.700 --> 2:51:04.700]  And again, more pop-up charter schools would be a nice thing.
[2:51:04.700 --> 2:51:06.700]  Hillsdale College, I'll mention them.
[2:51:06.700 --> 2:51:08.700]  Not a amount of paid spokesperson again,
[2:51:08.700 --> 2:51:10.700]  but I didn't say it earlier.
[2:51:10.700 --> 2:51:13.700]  Hillsdale College has pop-up K-12 schools all over the United States
[2:51:13.700 --> 2:51:16.700]  and they're always interested in hearing from other individuals
[2:51:16.700 --> 2:51:18.700]  in other states and saying, hey, look,
[2:51:18.700 --> 2:51:20.700]  we've got a vacant building over here.
[2:51:20.700 --> 2:51:22.700]  We would love for you to come here and implement.
[2:51:22.700 --> 2:51:24.700]  Exactly. In fact, I have family
[2:51:24.700 --> 2:51:27.700]  who paid forever this big Christian private school.
[2:51:27.700 --> 2:51:29.700]  It's like 80 years old.
[2:51:29.700 --> 2:51:31.700]  They ordered all the teachers to take shots
[2:51:31.700 --> 2:51:33.700]  and they want the kids over 12 to take it and everything.
[2:51:33.700 --> 2:51:35.700]  So half the school just left,
[2:51:35.700 --> 2:51:36.700]  pulled all their children out
[2:51:36.700 --> 2:51:38.700]  and they're just starting a whole new church school.
[2:51:38.700 --> 2:51:40.700]  I mean, the answer is innovation here.
[2:51:40.700 --> 2:51:42.700]  It really is.
[2:51:42.700 --> 2:51:44.700]  And again, a sound curriculum
[2:51:44.700 --> 2:51:46.700]  is not typically allowed
[2:51:46.700 --> 2:51:48.700]  in K-12 schools.
[2:51:48.700 --> 2:51:51.700]  They can pull the plug on Bitshoot
[2:51:51.700 --> 2:51:53.700]  in an instant.
[2:51:53.700 --> 2:51:55.700]  They can pull the plug on YouTube in an instant.
[2:51:55.700 --> 2:51:57.700]  And again, people watching YouTube at this point,
[2:51:57.700 --> 2:51:59.700]  I would say you're watching the wrong thing.
[2:51:59.700 --> 2:52:02.700]  They're suppressing the truth without a doubt
[2:52:02.700 --> 2:52:05.700]  and they're a cog in the wheel, which is too bad.
[2:52:05.700 --> 2:52:08.700]  You're right. YouTube is the most censored platform now.
[2:52:08.700 --> 2:52:10.700]  No doubt about it.
[2:52:10.700 --> 2:52:12.700]  I mean, Bitshoot and Gab and Telegram
[2:52:12.700 --> 2:52:15.700]  and Bandod video, I mean, that's where it's at right now.
[2:52:15.700 --> 2:52:17.700]  And then it has to be that way
[2:52:17.700 --> 2:52:19.700]  and we have to do whatever we can to maintain that.
[2:52:19.700 --> 2:52:22.700]  But if a K-12 student is in an environment like that
[2:52:22.700 --> 2:52:24.700]  and they're on their cell phone
[2:52:24.700 --> 2:52:26.700]  and they're trying to look up that kind of information
[2:52:26.700 --> 2:52:27.700]  on those platforms,
[2:52:27.700 --> 2:52:29.700]  they'll get their cell phone snatched right out of their hands.
[2:52:29.700 --> 2:52:32.700]  If they do it on a computer, on a school sanctioned computer,
[2:52:32.700 --> 2:52:35.700]  the internet servers at the district level
[2:52:35.700 --> 2:52:37.700]  pick that up and then they'll...
[2:52:37.700 --> 2:52:39.700]  Oh yeah, it's not just info wars.
[2:52:39.700 --> 2:52:41.700]  It's tens of thousands of sites
[2:52:41.700 --> 2:52:44.700]  including the Intercept and Glenn Greenwald and people
[2:52:44.700 --> 2:52:46.700]  are blocked in those databases
[2:52:46.700 --> 2:52:49.700]  created by Microsoft and others.
[2:52:49.700 --> 2:52:51.700]  I completely agree with you.
[2:52:51.700 --> 2:52:53.700]  I mean, there's no doubt about it.
[2:52:53.700 --> 2:52:56.700]  And again, as far as the school board meeting is concerned,
[2:52:56.700 --> 2:52:59.700]  the people in that room don't know about Dr. Zelinko
[2:52:59.700 --> 2:53:00.700]  for the most part.
[2:53:00.700 --> 2:53:04.700]  Again, the people who are patriots probably do.
[2:53:04.700 --> 2:53:06.700]  You know, the five docs on Rumble
[2:53:06.700 --> 2:53:07.700]  on the critically thinking channel.
[2:53:07.700 --> 2:53:10.700]  These are the people that I pay attention to, I listen to,
[2:53:10.700 --> 2:53:12.700]  and I take in all of their information.
[2:53:12.700 --> 2:53:14.700]  Dr. Mike Eaton, same thing.
[2:53:14.700 --> 2:53:17.700]  I could have name dropped throughout the entire thing,
[2:53:17.700 --> 2:53:19.700]  but I had to cut to the chase because again,
[2:53:19.700 --> 2:53:21.700]  I was limited in time.
[2:53:21.700 --> 2:53:23.700]  I showed up thinking I might have five minutes.
[2:53:23.700 --> 2:53:27.700]  I previously taped a guy who was given four and a half minutes
[2:53:27.700 --> 2:53:29.700]  in the last meeting in July,
[2:53:29.700 --> 2:53:33.700]  and I walked in, met some wonderful women in the back,
[2:53:33.700 --> 2:53:37.700]  some of which who worked for the district as non-teaching staff,
[2:53:37.700 --> 2:53:39.700]  and I said, how much time do I have?
[2:53:39.700 --> 2:53:41.700]  And they said, three minutes,
[2:53:41.700 --> 2:53:44.700]  but if you're kind to them up front
[2:53:44.700 --> 2:53:46.700]  and you're just kind of running through the motions
[2:53:46.700 --> 2:53:48.700]  and you're speaking quickly, they might give you a little more time.
[2:53:48.700 --> 2:53:50.700]  Well, they gave me almost four minutes solid,
[2:53:50.700 --> 2:53:52.700]  which was fine, but I had to cut.
[2:53:52.700 --> 2:53:55.700]  I mean, I had two pages of information I wanted to read off,
[2:53:55.700 --> 2:53:57.700]  and I had to cut it at least in half.
[2:53:57.700 --> 2:54:00.700]  So I was getting down to brass tacks,
[2:54:00.700 --> 2:54:02.700]  and once he said you got 15 minutes,
[2:54:02.700 --> 2:54:04.700]  that's when I grabbed him by the lapels and I said,
[2:54:04.700 --> 2:54:06.700]  look, this has already happened. It's going to happen.
[2:54:06.700 --> 2:54:08.700]  You can't stop what's coming here.
[2:54:08.700 --> 2:54:10.700]  And here's the thing.
[2:54:10.700 --> 2:54:14.700]  They're going to lie about it in the future, and we know that.
[2:54:14.700 --> 2:54:17.700]  They're going to say, we have teachers out who are sick.
[2:54:17.700 --> 2:54:19.700]  We need substitutes.
[2:54:19.700 --> 2:54:22.700]  They're never going to tell you why they're out sick.
[2:54:22.700 --> 2:54:24.700]  They're not going to say that.
[2:54:24.700 --> 2:54:26.700]  If they say that, the cat's out of the bag then,
[2:54:26.700 --> 2:54:29.700]  because we already see them lying about variants,
[2:54:29.700 --> 2:54:32.700]  and we see them lying and saying it's the unjabbed
[2:54:32.700 --> 2:54:35.700]  that are getting people sick.
[2:54:35.700 --> 2:54:37.700]  That's absurd.
[2:54:37.700 --> 2:54:39.700]  And the immune system, human immune system,
[2:54:39.700 --> 2:54:41.700]  does not operate that way.
[2:54:41.700 --> 2:54:45.700]  If you pump your body with poison, you will get sick.
[2:54:45.700 --> 2:54:47.700]  That's it.
[2:54:47.700 --> 2:54:50.700]  What I mean is that the K-12 environment,
[2:54:50.700 --> 2:54:53.700]  the same environment that taught us as minors
[2:54:53.700 --> 2:54:56.700]  to not believe peer pressure, to not take drugs,
[2:54:56.700 --> 2:55:00.700]  and to not believe peer pressure and take drugs from strangers,
[2:55:00.700 --> 2:55:03.700]  is the same environment now that is pushing this
[2:55:03.700 --> 2:55:07.700]  full bore down the throats of countless people,
[2:55:07.700 --> 2:55:10.700]  adults, children, and now they're all co-mingling
[2:55:10.700 --> 2:55:14.700]  in these environments as if nothing bad is going to happen.
[2:55:14.700 --> 2:55:16.700]  Again, I've said this on my podcast.
[2:55:16.700 --> 2:55:18.700]  If you don't need a Ouija board,
[2:55:18.700 --> 2:55:21.700]  tea leaves and chicken bones to figure this out.
[2:55:21.700 --> 2:55:23.700]  When cold and flu season rolls around,
[2:55:23.700 --> 2:55:25.700]  as even Dr. Zelinko said,
[2:55:25.700 --> 2:55:27.700]  you're talking about a ticking time bomb
[2:55:27.700 --> 2:55:30.700]  when it comes to a person's immune system.
[2:55:30.700 --> 2:55:32.700]  I mean, you just are.
[2:55:32.700 --> 2:55:34.700]  And Indiana University is another example.
[2:55:34.700 --> 2:55:37.700]  Over the summer, before summer,
[2:55:37.700 --> 2:55:39.700]  they said everybody who works here
[2:55:39.700 --> 2:55:42.700]  and everybody who comes here has to be jabbed end of story.
[2:55:42.700 --> 2:55:45.700]  As you would expect, countless students
[2:55:45.700 --> 2:55:47.700]  started to sue Indiana University.
[2:55:47.700 --> 2:55:50.700]  A judge got involved, and if I'm not mistaken,
[2:55:50.700 --> 2:55:53.700]  the judge sided with Indiana University
[2:55:53.700 --> 2:55:55.700]  and said they get to do what they want.
[2:55:55.700 --> 2:55:58.700]  I could have that wrong, but I think that's right
[2:55:58.700 --> 2:56:00.700]  as to how that ended up settling out.
[2:56:00.700 --> 2:56:03.700]  So everybody who attends now is jabbed.
[2:56:03.700 --> 2:56:05.700]  That's what 100% said.
[2:56:05.700 --> 2:56:07.700]  All right, stay there. I'm going to come back to you.
[2:56:07.700 --> 2:56:09.700]  And speaking of you wanting to be able to speak five minutes
[2:56:09.700 --> 2:56:12.700]  at that school board meeting where you're knocking out of the park,
[2:56:12.700 --> 2:56:16.700]  let's give you, when we come back,
[2:56:16.700 --> 2:56:18.700]  this segment's only five, so we'll talk to you
[2:56:18.700 --> 2:56:20.700]  in the next segment, I'm going to just shut up for five minutes
[2:56:20.700 --> 2:56:23.700]  and you can give your full speech
[2:56:23.700 --> 2:56:25.700]  that you were unable to give on the other side.
[2:56:25.700 --> 2:56:27.700]  We really appreciate your perspective.
[2:56:27.700 --> 2:56:30.700]  Everything else, Dr. Sean M. Brooks, PhD.
[2:56:30.700 --> 2:56:33.700]  Okay, folks, we're going to go to break here.
[2:56:33.700 --> 2:56:35.700]  Please don't forget, the way we stay on here
[2:56:35.700 --> 2:56:37.700]  is you buying products.
[2:56:37.700 --> 2:56:39.700]  We don't have big sponsors. We have you.
[2:56:39.700 --> 2:56:42.700]  This is Dr. Paul Warstor.com as a big special.
[2:56:42.700 --> 2:56:45.700]  Vitamin mineral fusion that's so good for your immune system
[2:56:45.700 --> 2:56:48.700]  and all your body's functions has all the vitamins, all the minerals,
[2:56:48.700 --> 2:56:52.700]  and on top of that, it's got a bunch of key amino acids as well.
[2:56:52.700 --> 2:56:54.700]  It's back in stock.
[2:56:54.700 --> 2:56:57.700]  It's been sold out for a long time, 33% off.
[2:56:57.700 --> 2:56:59.700]  It's great for children, adults, but especially old folks
[2:56:59.700 --> 2:57:01.700]  because a lot of vitamins and minerals are great,
[2:57:01.700 --> 2:57:03.700]  but they're in pill form and some people don't absorb them good.
[2:57:03.700 --> 2:57:06.700]  This is liquids. You get a much, much higher absorption rate.
[2:57:06.700 --> 2:57:09.700]  Vitamin mineral fusion back in stock, 33% off.
[2:57:09.700 --> 2:57:12.700]  Living defense has got a bunch of things like concentrated black walnut o-things
[2:57:12.700 --> 2:57:15.700]  that flush out and detoxify your guts
[2:57:15.700 --> 2:57:17.700]  and get rid of unwanted visitors.
[2:57:17.700 --> 2:57:20.700]  Living defense sold out for months back in stock, 40% off.
[2:57:20.700 --> 2:57:22.700]  Ultimate krill oil.
[2:57:22.700 --> 2:57:26.700]  I could buy krill oil for 10% of the price I'd buy this, but it's crappy.
[2:57:26.700 --> 2:57:28.700]  This is the highest-grade krill oil.
[2:57:28.700 --> 2:57:32.700]  So good for your heart, your liver, your brain, your arteries, everything.
[2:57:32.700 --> 2:57:33.700]  40% off.
[2:57:33.700 --> 2:57:36.700]  Basil Beach creates nitrous oxide in the body, concentrated beet extract.
[2:57:36.700 --> 2:57:39.700]  It's 50% off and more.
[2:57:39.700 --> 2:57:42.700]  Infowarsstore.com, that's what funds the operation.
[2:57:42.700 --> 2:58:04.700]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[2:58:12.700 --> 2:58:15.700]  The Hindu Chakras align with the endocrine system.
[2:58:15.700 --> 2:58:18.700]  The chakra aligned with the pineal gland is the third eye.
[2:58:18.700 --> 2:58:23.700]  Also described as the seat of the soul, the pineal gland is what connects us
[2:58:23.700 --> 2:58:28.700]  to higher levels of consciousness and otherwise unseen dimensions of reality.
[2:58:28.700 --> 2:58:33.700]  Fluoride-free water is essential to keeping our pineal gland healthy.
[2:58:33.700 --> 2:58:39.700]  Our water filtration systems with the proper filters will keep your drinking water fluoride-free
[2:58:39.700 --> 2:58:42.700]  and the propure shower head will seal the deal.
[2:58:42.700 --> 2:59:11.700]  Get them both today for yourself or a friend
[2:59:11.700 --> 2:59:37.700]  of mine.
[2:59:37.700 --> 3:00:03.700]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:00:03.700 --> 3:00:12.700]  We've got this segment and a little bit of the next segment with Dr. Sean M. Brooks.
[3:00:12.700 --> 3:00:16.700]  I'll have the floor, like he's speaking at the local school board there in Ohio,
[3:00:16.700 --> 3:00:18.700]  hailing from Oxford, Ohio.
[3:00:18.700 --> 3:00:22.700]  And the next segment that I got a bunch of it is Blitzkrieg with Owen Schreuer
[3:00:22.700 --> 3:00:25.700]  in here before he takes over and has three hours of war on himself.
[3:00:25.700 --> 3:00:30.700]  But Doc, just as a human, as a patriot, do you have hope with what's going on in the world?
[3:00:30.700 --> 3:00:35.700]  Because, like you said, this is war and this is the big grand assault.
[3:00:35.700 --> 3:00:39.700]  I do, and I would consider everybody again, and this has been said before,
[3:00:39.700 --> 3:00:44.700]  so it's, again, not a new thing, but I would consider people.
[3:00:44.700 --> 3:00:51.700]  I would encourage them to think about their ancestors during this entire time.
[3:00:51.700 --> 3:00:53.700]  Our ancestors have passed on.
[3:00:53.700 --> 3:00:55.700]  They can see clearly what's going on.
[3:00:55.700 --> 3:01:00.700]  They didn't create us to just sit around and do nothing.
[3:01:00.700 --> 3:01:06.700]  And given the fact that this is a war, it's the responsibility of parents
[3:01:06.700 --> 3:01:10.700]  to shield their children from the bullets and the gunfire.
[3:01:10.700 --> 3:01:15.700]  They should show them what's going on, and many of them are,
[3:01:15.700 --> 3:01:17.700]  and God bless each and every one of them.
[3:01:17.700 --> 3:01:20.700]  But for the ones that are dead asleep, even them hearing this,
[3:01:20.700 --> 3:01:22.700]  it's not going to make a dent, maybe.
[3:01:22.700 --> 3:01:28.700]  They don't know, but they need to shield them from what's taking place,
[3:01:28.700 --> 3:01:31.700]  but at the same time educate them about what's taking place.
[3:01:31.700 --> 3:01:35.700]  And I think even Dr. Mike Yeadon said this as well.
[3:01:35.700 --> 3:01:40.700]  He was talking about, look, don't pay attention to your degrees.
[3:01:40.700 --> 3:01:46.700]  Don't pay attention to, well, I'm not going to get my high school diploma on time, quote, unquote.
[3:01:46.700 --> 3:01:48.700]  That's gone.
[3:01:48.700 --> 3:01:50.700]  You have to throw that out the window.
[3:01:50.700 --> 3:01:54.700]  You can get a high school diploma any time you want.
[3:01:54.700 --> 3:01:56.700]  Again, you can homeschool.
[3:01:56.700 --> 3:02:01.700]  This is a civilization level design collapse in their own words.
[3:02:01.700 --> 3:02:02.700]  You're right.
[3:02:02.700 --> 3:02:04.700]  We're in the middle of a giant war.
[3:02:04.700 --> 3:02:07.700]  All that matters is winning this war right now.
[3:02:07.700 --> 3:02:08.700]  That's right.
[3:02:08.700 --> 3:02:12.700]  That's the way that I see it, because again, there are too many people
[3:02:12.700 --> 3:02:16.700]  sending their own children into the slaughterhouse, so to speak.
[3:02:16.700 --> 3:02:19.700]  And as it's been said on your show, I'm sure a million times,
[3:02:19.700 --> 3:02:24.700]  by the time you smell the blood of the sheep in front of you, it's too late.
[3:02:24.700 --> 3:02:28.700]  And again, it's gotten to the point now where, hey, look, it's too late.
[3:02:28.700 --> 3:02:31.700]  Now, I know it's not happening in every school across America,
[3:02:31.700 --> 3:02:34.700]  but goodness gracious, the vice is closing in here.
[3:02:34.700 --> 3:02:39.700]  And these private schools and charter schools that aren't doing this
[3:02:39.700 --> 3:02:41.700]  can only have so many students.
[3:02:41.700 --> 3:02:44.700]  I mean, they have a cap on their population.
[3:02:44.700 --> 3:02:47.700]  And then the next year, what do you think is going to happen?
[3:02:47.700 --> 3:02:50.700]  Are those students going to leave that school that's been a safe harbor
[3:02:50.700 --> 3:02:52.700]  during this entire time?
[3:02:52.700 --> 3:02:53.700]  No.
[3:02:53.700 --> 3:02:55.700]  They're going to continue to have those students.
[3:02:55.700 --> 3:02:58.700]  They might pick up some more in the grade level below them.
[3:02:58.700 --> 3:03:00.700]  And that will continue, which is a great thing.
[3:03:00.700 --> 3:03:04.700]  But those schools have to multiply.
[3:03:04.700 --> 3:03:10.700]  And mass non-compliance has consistently been said, and I completely agree with it.
[3:03:10.700 --> 3:03:13.700]  More people have to walk out of these schools permanently.
[3:03:13.700 --> 3:03:18.700]  It will shine a light on the school board, their actions, everything they're doing.
[3:03:18.700 --> 3:03:22.700]  And that's already happening as well as, as you said, the colleges, hospitals,
[3:03:22.700 --> 3:03:27.700]  and the public schools, the primary schools, there's a giant exodus.
[3:03:27.700 --> 3:03:28.700]  How are they dealing with that?
[3:03:28.700 --> 3:03:31.700]  I guess the bureaucrats don't care because they're still getting their money.
[3:03:31.700 --> 3:03:33.700]  They've gotten their money for the year.
[3:03:33.700 --> 3:03:35.700]  The K-12 schools have gotten their money for the year.
[3:03:35.700 --> 3:03:38.700]  So the time to walk away is now and permanently.
[3:03:38.700 --> 3:03:45.700]  That's the way that I see it, because if they leave now and only return in the spring,
[3:03:45.700 --> 3:03:51.700]  and then say, well, we'll come back next fall when you've decided to not be totalitarians,
[3:03:51.700 --> 3:03:55.700]  which they're not going to do, the road has already been crossed there.
[3:03:55.700 --> 3:03:59.700]  So they have to leave and then stay away.
[3:03:59.700 --> 3:04:05.700]  And again, that's a difficult leap for someone and a parent and a family that's been in a pattern of behavior
[3:04:05.700 --> 3:04:09.700]  or had a pattern of behavior in their own mind for a very long time.
[3:04:09.700 --> 3:04:14.700]  Sure, but folks have to get the social contracts broken the more we submit early, it's worse.
[3:04:14.700 --> 3:04:16.700]  Now we just have to pull out and say no.
[3:04:16.700 --> 3:04:18.700]  That's right.
[3:04:18.700 --> 3:04:24.700]  And online university, online college institutions have always been ahead of the curve.
[3:04:24.700 --> 3:04:25.700]  Always.
[3:04:25.700 --> 3:04:29.700]  You never would have caught me in a brick and mortar school building getting a PhD at a university,
[3:04:29.700 --> 3:04:34.700]  and I could have done it for free, but I didn't want to do it because I've been through the system.
[3:04:34.700 --> 3:04:36.700]  So I have expectations.
[3:04:36.700 --> 3:04:39.700]  And if those expectations aren't met on day one, I'm out.
[3:04:39.700 --> 3:04:45.700]  And I would prefer, as most people are finding out now, you mean I can learn at home,
[3:04:45.700 --> 3:04:50.700]  and the computer and learning at home, all of that stuff is propaganda as far as it being bad.
[3:04:50.700 --> 3:04:51.700]  It's not.
[3:04:51.700 --> 3:04:53.700]  Let the mind wander.
[3:04:53.700 --> 3:04:55.700]  Let the mind do what I want to do.
[3:04:55.700 --> 3:04:57.700]  Well, sure, you've got a mainline college, not even a professor there.
[3:04:57.700 --> 3:04:58.700]  It's just a bunch of zombies.
[3:04:58.700 --> 3:04:59.700]  We're right back.
[3:04:59.700 --> 3:05:04.700]  Not all vitamin and mineral supplements are equal. Many of them are synthetic.
[3:05:04.700 --> 3:05:06.700]  Many of them have fillers and additives.
[3:05:06.700 --> 3:05:09.700]  Many of them just pass right through the body and are not absorbed.
[3:05:09.700 --> 3:05:14.700]  Well, that's not the case with our incredibly popular, because it's so effective product
[3:05:14.700 --> 3:05:18.700]  that it's now been sold out for months, but it's finally back in stone.
[3:05:18.700 --> 3:05:20.700]  And that is vitamin, mineral fusion.
[3:05:20.700 --> 3:05:25.700]  All the essential vitamins, all the essential minerals, a bunch of q-mino acids to help it upload
[3:05:25.700 --> 3:05:29.700]  better into your body and your cells. It's in powder form. It's great for children.
[3:05:29.700 --> 3:05:30.700]  It's great for adults.
[3:05:30.700 --> 3:05:35.700]  It's really important for folks that are older, because they don't absorb as well through their guts.
[3:05:35.700 --> 3:05:37.700]  So this liquid formula really, really does it.
[3:05:37.700 --> 3:05:42.700]  You mix up a picture of it every couple of days, put it in the refrigerator, keep it out in the kitchen,
[3:05:42.700 --> 3:05:45.700]  and just remember to drink it in the morning and in the evening.
[3:05:45.700 --> 3:05:47.700]  It tastes great. It makes your body healthy.
[3:05:47.700 --> 3:05:51.700]  It boosts your immune system, and it funds the info war.
[3:05:51.700 --> 3:05:55.700]  A true 360 wins of vitamin, mineral fusion sold out for months.
[3:05:55.700 --> 3:05:59.700]  It's back in stone for a limited time, 33% off at FullWarStore.com.
[3:06:04.700 --> 3:06:08.700]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones.
[3:06:12.700 --> 3:06:15.700]  All right, we got a jam-packed hour coming up here.
[3:06:15.700 --> 3:06:21.700]  Owen Shore joins me in a few minutes, let out a federal jail yesterday for being at the Capitol.
[3:06:21.700 --> 3:06:25.700]  They didn't commit any crimes. It wasn't violent, but they still call that a crime.
[3:06:25.700 --> 3:06:31.700]  Dr. Sean M. Brooks, Ph.D., went super viral, one of the most viral clips coming out of these city council meetings
[3:06:31.700 --> 3:06:35.700]  and school board meetings, which everybody should be using as folks are watching these.
[3:06:35.700 --> 3:06:40.700]  It's getting out to a wider audience. It doesn't matter. The bureaucrats laugh at you. They'll cry later.
[3:06:40.700 --> 3:06:43.700]  But you said you thought you had five minutes. They cut it down to three.
[3:06:43.700 --> 3:06:49.700]  So you got the floor right now to re-give that speech and not be interrupted, not be told 15 seconds.
[3:06:49.700 --> 3:06:55.700]  So you give us the next speech from Dr. Sean M. Brooks, AmericanEducationFM.com.
[3:06:56.700 --> 3:07:02.700]  I appreciate it. I'm not sure I could repeat it, but I'll certainly bring up a few points that are worth bringing up.
[3:07:02.700 --> 3:07:09.700]  Number one, we all know about the faulty tests. They're using these faulty tests and they're testing students
[3:07:09.700 --> 3:07:16.700]  consistently as they come in, temperature checks, XYZ.
[3:07:16.700 --> 3:07:24.700]  All of this is an invasion. All of this is child abuse, and people need to, again, they've got to wrap their arms around this.
[3:07:24.700 --> 3:07:29.700]  It's not under the guise of health. It never has been. It's child abuse. That's number one.
[3:07:29.700 --> 3:07:33.700]  Number two, they're using those faulty tests to quarantine students.
[3:07:33.700 --> 3:07:42.700]  They use a faulty test. They test positive. They throw them in an isolated room by themselves somewhere,
[3:07:42.700 --> 3:07:45.700]  which I don't know how schools can accommodate for that.
[3:07:45.700 --> 3:07:50.700]  And then they're calling home and they're saying, well, they tested positive. You need to come and pick them up.
[3:07:50.700 --> 3:07:53.700]  And then they come and pick them up.
[3:07:53.700 --> 3:07:59.700]  So the parents are being yanked around by a leash regarding all of this on a consistent basis.
[3:07:59.700 --> 3:08:07.700]  It baffles the mind as to why a parent would continue to send their child to an environment that's engaging in such practices.
[3:08:07.700 --> 3:08:12.700]  I would encourage people to look up Ohio House Bill 248.
[3:08:12.700 --> 3:08:20.700]  That's currently being discussed, I believe, on the House floor in Ohio, and it has to do with vaccine rights.
[3:08:20.700 --> 3:08:24.700]  No passports, no mandates, no jabs, right across the board.
[3:08:24.700 --> 3:08:32.700]  I believe it also includes all vaccines so that schools can't in the future say, well, they have to have this and they have to have that.
[3:08:32.700 --> 3:08:43.700]  This notion that the unvaxxed or the unjabbed would ever make someone ill in a K-12 environment who's taken all of these drugs and these poisons is absurd.
[3:08:43.700 --> 3:08:48.700]  It defies logic as to why that would even be the case.
[3:08:48.700 --> 3:08:54.700]  So again, the quarantining is beyond alarming.
[3:08:54.700 --> 3:09:04.700]  The moment that, you know, I don't have children, but if at the moment that I had heard that and that being done to one of my own children, that would have been the last straw.
[3:09:04.700 --> 3:09:05.700]  That would have been it.
[3:09:05.700 --> 3:09:08.700]  I would have immediately started a research homeschooling.
[3:09:08.700 --> 3:09:13.700]  And again, countless parents throughout the United States and around the world have done just that.
[3:09:13.700 --> 3:09:25.700]  I would also take it a step further and go back to again what Dr. Mike Eaton said, which is you've got to completely shake up your notion of the pragmatic way that things have been done in the past.
[3:09:25.700 --> 3:09:27.700]  It didn't work then.
[3:09:27.700 --> 3:09:33.700]  And we're in war now, which means things are not going to be the same, nor should they.
[3:09:33.700 --> 3:09:45.700]  We're evolving to the point where we can become more independent and stop being so reliant on government and the people around us to make our education decisions for us.
[3:09:45.700 --> 3:09:52.700]  We've always known that the Rockefellers and the Carnegie's have had everything to do with the K-12 textbook system.
[3:09:52.700 --> 3:09:54.700]  No different in higher ed.
[3:09:54.700 --> 3:09:55.700]  It's the exact same.
[3:09:55.700 --> 3:09:58.700]  They control the information.
[3:09:58.700 --> 3:10:02.700]  They control the minds of those individuals that don't think for themselves.
[3:10:02.700 --> 3:10:08.700]  And again, when I was in college, the books I read were the ones that I went to the bookstore to buy.
[3:10:08.700 --> 3:10:13.700]  They were not the ones that the university said, well, you need to read this and you need to read that.
[3:10:13.700 --> 3:10:17.700]  I'd look at this $300 textbook and say, no, I'm not reading this.
[3:10:17.700 --> 3:10:19.700]  And I'd glance through it.
[3:10:19.700 --> 3:10:21.700]  I'd write a paper for the class and then that'd be it.
[3:10:21.700 --> 3:10:33.700]  And then I'd go to a bookstore back when bookstores existed and I would buy two, three, four books about people, history, events, psychology, sociology, anatomy, physiology.
[3:10:33.700 --> 3:10:36.700]  And I would put all of this together and I'd read on my own time.
[3:10:36.700 --> 3:10:40.700]  People have to self-educate and we have to let children do that.
[3:10:40.700 --> 3:10:49.700]  Well, for those that don't know, Doc, up until really the 1850s and stuff, most colleges, you had to come examined even get in them.
[3:10:49.700 --> 3:10:51.700]  People were self-taught or they apprenticed.
[3:10:51.700 --> 3:10:56.700]  Most lawyers, like Andrew Jackson and others, they just went and apprenticed for two years.
[3:10:56.700 --> 3:10:57.700]  One guy might have to apprentice for 10.
[3:10:57.700 --> 3:10:58.700]  They maybe never got him a law license.
[3:10:58.700 --> 3:10:59.700]  He wasn't good.
[3:10:59.700 --> 3:11:01.700]  Jackson, they said, in two years, you got it.
[3:11:01.700 --> 3:11:04.700]  He was like a judge a few years later because he was competent.
[3:11:04.700 --> 3:11:06.700]  It was the apprentice system that was all self-taught.
[3:11:06.700 --> 3:11:10.700]  That's like Benjamin Franklin, one of the smartest guys in history, never went to school anywhere.
[3:11:10.700 --> 3:11:18.700]  But the guy fricking got all the awards you could get in the world and professorships because he was self-taught and read books 10 hours a day.
[3:11:18.700 --> 3:11:20.700]  And there was no bell.
[3:11:20.700 --> 3:11:26.700]  There was no bell to tell people the learning stops for this subject right now, see it tomorrow.
[3:11:26.700 --> 3:11:27.700]  It didn't exist.
[3:11:27.700 --> 3:11:34.700]  The Prussian education system is the largest failure that's ever existed in the history of our country as far as education is concerned.
[3:11:34.700 --> 3:11:40.700]  For those that don't know, it was trained to create mindless soldiers and programmable people.
[3:11:40.700 --> 3:11:42.700]  That's the whole modern psychology came out of that.
[3:11:42.700 --> 3:11:44.700]  That is not the American system.
[3:11:44.700 --> 3:11:45.700]  Correct.
[3:11:45.700 --> 3:11:50.700]  And unfortunately, we have a great deal of individuals who have never taught a day in their life,
[3:11:50.700 --> 3:11:56.700]  commenting on K-12 education haphazardly or just at the surface level without diving in a little bit deeper.
[3:11:56.700 --> 3:12:01.700]  Those same people, unfortunately, are the ones educating the future teachers of America.
[3:12:01.700 --> 3:12:06.700]  And that happens and has been happening now since, well, God knows when, a very long time.
[3:12:06.700 --> 3:12:08.700]  And that's also problematic.
[3:12:08.700 --> 3:12:15.700]  I mean, I've been shut out of the higher ed institutions and it's not an accident.
[3:12:15.700 --> 3:12:16.700]  Hey, but it doesn't matter.
[3:12:16.700 --> 3:12:19.700]  You're speaking up and you're out there now and you've written books and you're taking action.
[3:12:19.700 --> 3:12:22.700]  Dr. Sean M. Brooks, PhD, thank you so much.
[3:12:22.700 --> 3:12:27.700]  We really appreciate your time and great job on your viral interview or your viral speech.
[3:12:27.700 --> 3:12:29.700]  We want to see more of you and have you back on.
[3:12:29.700 --> 3:12:30.700]  Thank you.
[3:12:30.700 --> 3:12:31.700]  I appreciate it.
[3:12:31.700 --> 3:12:32.700]  Thank you.
[3:12:32.700 --> 3:12:33.700]  All right.
[3:12:33.700 --> 3:12:34.700]  That was powerful.
[3:12:34.700 --> 3:12:37.700]  Speaking of the young people waking up, I got a bunch of clips I haven't gotten to.
[3:12:37.700 --> 3:12:40.700]  We're going to break them back with all this breaking news.
[3:12:40.700 --> 3:12:44.700]  UK kid on why he's not getting the so-called vaccine.
[3:12:44.700 --> 3:12:45.700]  This is powerful.
[3:12:45.700 --> 3:12:46.700]  Here it is.
[3:12:46.700 --> 3:12:48.700]  You're obviously aware of the adverse vaccine reactions.
[3:12:48.700 --> 3:12:49.700]  Not everyone is.
[3:12:49.700 --> 3:12:51.700]  So you don't want to take the vaccine.
[3:12:51.700 --> 3:12:54.700]  What pressure have you had from friends or family?
[3:12:54.700 --> 3:12:57.700]  Because your particular age group has been targeted lately in terms of nightclubs,
[3:12:57.700 --> 3:12:59.700]  universities going on holiday.
[3:12:59.700 --> 3:13:02.700]  So my auntie works for AstraZeneca.
[3:13:02.700 --> 3:13:08.700]  So the pressure from family, some of my family is quite great to get the vaccine.
[3:13:08.700 --> 3:13:10.700]  They're like, why haven't you taken the vaccine?
[3:13:10.700 --> 3:13:11.700]  Why haven't you taken the vaccine?
[3:13:11.700 --> 3:13:12.700]  You're selfish.
[3:13:12.700 --> 3:13:13.700]  My cousin's even cut, what?
[3:13:13.700 --> 3:13:16.700]  My cousin from Cambridge has even cut me a twat over it.
[3:13:16.700 --> 3:13:18.700]  Not getting the vaccine, you know.
[3:13:18.700 --> 3:13:22.700]  But I've lost friends over it as well.
[3:13:22.700 --> 3:13:26.700]  There are some friends though who won't take the vaccine no matter what.
[3:13:26.700 --> 3:13:29.700]  And that's because they've seen what it's done to people.
[3:13:29.700 --> 3:13:35.700]  I've got friends who are very ill and haven't been well since the day they took it and
[3:13:35.700 --> 3:13:36.700]  have regretted it.
[3:13:36.700 --> 3:13:39.700]  But I've also got friends who are like, well, if you don't take the vaccine, you're going
[3:13:39.700 --> 3:13:40.700]  to be killing other people.
[3:13:40.700 --> 3:13:44.700]  But if you can still get it when you've got the vaccine, how am I killing other people?
[3:13:44.700 --> 3:13:47.700]  It doesn't prevent transmission because you can still pass it on.
[3:13:47.700 --> 3:13:48.700]  You can still get it.
[3:13:48.700 --> 3:13:49.700]  So how am I killing other people?
[3:13:49.700 --> 3:13:50.700]  I'm not being selfish.
[3:13:50.700 --> 3:13:51.700]  It's my body and my choice.
[3:13:51.700 --> 3:13:53.700]  What's the world looking like for you?
[3:13:53.700 --> 3:13:58.700]  Because for the younger generations, if this vaccine passports are taken up by the majority,
[3:13:58.700 --> 3:14:02.700]  what do you think the world's going to look like in a year?
[3:14:02.700 --> 3:14:05.700]  In a year, I have no idea.
[3:14:05.700 --> 3:14:11.700]  It's straight off the 1984 book.
[3:14:11.700 --> 3:14:15.700]  The idea that we're going to have to get out our phones and get up our passes, show our
[3:14:15.700 --> 3:14:19.700]  papers in the streets, or if we want to go into a pub, it's funny.
[3:14:19.700 --> 3:14:25.700]  It's honestly funny that people don't see where this is going, where this is going.
[3:14:25.700 --> 3:14:27.700]  It's about control.
[3:14:27.700 --> 3:14:33.700]  If you allow the government to break the law and to violate your rights because of an emergency,
[3:14:33.700 --> 3:14:37.700]  what's stopping them from creating an emergency to break the law?
[3:14:37.700 --> 3:14:42.700]  Good old-fashioned Anglo-Saxon sense, just genetically coming out of that young man.
[3:14:42.700 --> 3:14:47.700]  And that's why the system wants to discredit where all the modern freedoms came from, that
[3:14:47.700 --> 3:14:50.700]  little island, in the last thousand years.
[3:14:50.700 --> 3:14:54.700]  A lot of great people, a lot of great cultures, but the globalists want to get rid of the
[3:14:54.700 --> 3:14:59.700]  Anglo-Saxon idea of freedom because it flies in the face of everything else.
[3:14:59.700 --> 3:15:03.700]  And a lot of the people that are obsessed with hating Israel and Jews and all that, they
[3:15:03.700 --> 3:15:06.700]  always like, well, there's no Judea to the Christian.
[3:15:06.700 --> 3:15:07.700]  Well, there really is.
[3:15:07.700 --> 3:15:09.700]  That's what Christianity comes out of.
[3:15:09.700 --> 3:15:13.700]  You can look at bad parts of Judaism, bad parts of Christianity, more modern forms of
[3:15:13.700 --> 3:15:15.700]  it or whatever, the case of Judaism.
[3:15:15.700 --> 3:15:17.700]  That's a side issue.
[3:15:17.700 --> 3:15:22.700]  The Jews also did develop due process and some of the things that when they actually ran
[3:15:22.700 --> 3:15:27.700]  into some of the Anglo-Saxon type laws that were already there, the Anglo-Saxons adopted
[3:15:27.700 --> 3:15:28.700]  it because it made sense to them.
[3:15:28.700 --> 3:15:30.700]  So they're very similar systems.
[3:15:30.700 --> 3:15:35.700]  And the globalists are getting rid of all of that right now.
[3:15:35.700 --> 3:15:36.700]  They're just trashing it.
[3:15:36.700 --> 3:15:41.700]  They're burning it with classic paganism, which just says, well, kill whoever we want.
[3:15:41.700 --> 3:15:42.700]  We'll do whatever we want.
[3:15:42.700 --> 3:15:43.700]  We'll rule everyone.
[3:15:43.700 --> 3:15:45.700]  It's all right to do it.
[3:15:45.700 --> 3:15:46.700]  All right.
[3:15:46.700 --> 3:15:49.700]  Owen Shroyer is out of jail, but he's got a hearing Thursday.
[3:15:49.700 --> 3:15:51.700]  A hanging judge might try to throw him back in.
[3:15:51.700 --> 3:15:53.700]  He's got big updates there.
[3:15:53.700 --> 3:15:55.700]  And did I really come out against Trump?
[3:15:55.700 --> 3:16:23.700]  I'll tell you about that when we come back and so much more.
[3:16:23.700 --> 3:16:28.700]  Fireplace heat without fireplace smoke, wall of fire.com.

[3:20:47.700 --> 3:20:51.540]  If you poured gasoline on yourself and burn yourself, the answer is more gasoline.
[3:20:51.540 --> 3:20:55.140]  If you cut yourself and it hurt, the answer is cut yourself more.
[3:20:55.140 --> 3:21:00.980]  If you're fat because you eat too much, the answer is eat more, more, more, more.
[3:21:00.980 --> 3:21:04.020]  Oh, and Shroyer's here. A video is out.
[3:21:04.020 --> 3:21:10.500]  Pfizer's CEO says COVID-19 vaccines resistant variant likely to emerge.
[3:21:10.500 --> 3:21:13.620]  It already has from the people that took the shot.
[3:21:13.620 --> 3:21:20.500]  And now they admit only a 90-something percent efficacy rate in our face.
[3:21:20.500 --> 3:21:26.500]  And Bloomberg tells the world, oh, you're going to have to take monthly shots
[3:21:26.500 --> 3:21:28.180]  that totally destroy your immune system.
[3:21:28.180 --> 3:21:30.980]  I mean, the logic is out the window.
[3:21:30.980 --> 3:21:34.100]  It was all premeditated. We called it over a year and a half ago.
[3:21:34.100 --> 3:21:36.820]  And Owen, now here we are. What do you make of this?
[3:21:37.780 --> 3:21:39.700]  Well, there's a lot of analogies you could make.
[3:21:39.700 --> 3:21:43.300]  I mean, I guess this is a little more advanced.
[3:21:43.300 --> 3:21:45.860]  Like if you were in a sci-fi novel like a movie
[3:21:45.860 --> 3:21:50.500]  and somebody created some sort of monster, human-eating monster
[3:21:50.500 --> 3:21:52.180]  that could procreate really fast.
[3:21:52.180 --> 3:21:54.900]  And then, oh, well, you have to be a slave now because of this monster
[3:21:54.900 --> 3:21:58.100]  that procreates really fast and just eats humans and eats human flesh.
[3:21:58.100 --> 3:22:00.580]  Well, you say, who created this? Who released this on us?
[3:22:01.140 --> 3:22:03.060]  And you wouldn't then go to them for the answer.
[3:22:03.060 --> 3:22:06.740]  You wouldn't then go to them to say, hey, you know, tell me what to do now.
[3:22:06.740 --> 3:22:10.180]  That's right. The very people that cooked it up, released it, lied about it,
[3:22:10.180 --> 3:22:12.740]  and got caught that make money out of it, who, by the way,
[3:22:12.740 --> 3:22:15.380]  said they wanted to be populatists are the ones running it.
[3:22:15.380 --> 3:22:17.300]  It's so frustrating to know all this, Alex.
[3:22:17.300 --> 3:22:21.220]  And you know, what's sad is most people just don't have a clue.
[3:22:21.220 --> 3:22:24.100]  And you're talking about highly educated people
[3:22:24.100 --> 3:22:26.340]  that are at the top echelon of their profession.
[3:22:26.340 --> 3:22:27.860]  They just can't believe there's predators.
[3:22:27.860 --> 3:22:29.620]  And they just can't believe that any of this is going on
[3:22:29.620 --> 3:22:30.740]  or they just don't pay attention.
[3:22:30.740 --> 3:22:33.060]  They don't know. And it's frustrating for us to just sit here,
[3:22:33.060 --> 3:22:35.780]  be in the abyss, stare into the abyss, study the abyss.
[3:22:35.780 --> 3:22:38.740]  But as follow up for that story that you had out of Israel,
[3:22:38.740 --> 3:22:40.660]  this is going to be one of the main stories that I'm covering today.
[3:22:40.660 --> 3:22:43.780]  I've got a huge three hour broadcast, a lot of COVID news,
[3:22:43.780 --> 3:22:45.620]  including a guest that's going to be joining us.
[3:22:45.620 --> 3:22:48.420]  She got the vaccine about a month ago, hasn't had a day without a seizure.
[3:22:48.980 --> 3:22:52.020]  And that was never a problem for her until she got the vaccine.
[3:22:52.020 --> 3:22:54.340]  Liberals even say they're willing to have death for it.
[3:22:54.340 --> 3:22:56.740]  Well, yeah. Well, it's better that you die from a vaccine
[3:22:56.740 --> 3:22:59.140]  than you die from anything else. They say that's what the girls said.
[3:22:59.140 --> 3:23:01.220]  They're both their parents died from the shot. She goes, well, it's good.
[3:23:01.220 --> 3:23:02.500]  That's multiple examples now.
[3:23:02.500 --> 3:23:05.860]  But there's also a story that's going to be one of my main stories today,
[3:23:05.860 --> 3:23:09.940]  because this is kind of, I think the canary in the coal mine here has to be Israel.
[3:23:09.940 --> 3:23:11.940]  And guys, if you plug in, I don't know if you have the story on your desk,
[3:23:11.940 --> 3:23:14.660]  you can just plug in ultravaxxed Israel.
[3:23:14.660 --> 3:23:19.060]  They're basically admitting now that it's all the vaccinated people that are sick.
[3:23:19.060 --> 3:23:23.620]  Israel is the most, as you just said, it's 90% of the hospitalizations are vaccinated people.
[3:23:23.620 --> 3:23:25.300]  Type it in, ultravaxxed Israel.
[3:23:25.940 --> 3:23:30.660]  Israel is the most vaccinated nation on earth, and it has the most COVID on earth.
[3:23:30.660 --> 3:23:32.180]  There it is right there, ultravaxxed Israel.
[3:23:32.180 --> 3:23:35.860]  And they said it, it's a warning. You better take more shots.
[3:23:35.860 --> 3:23:39.380]  They took the most shots. They're the most sick. So you need more.
[3:23:40.180 --> 3:23:43.300]  I can't put the clown world nature of this.
[3:23:43.300 --> 3:23:47.300]  It's like saying, if I punched you in the face and it hurt, the answer is you go, hit me more.
[3:23:47.940 --> 3:23:51.700]  They're like, oh, I'm bleeding. I need stitches now. Please, you know,
[3:23:51.700 --> 3:23:54.020]  you know, give me a brain hemorrhage, you know, crack my skull.
[3:23:54.580 --> 3:23:57.700]  I want more of it. I want death. How can this be?
[3:23:57.700 --> 3:24:02.180]  How can these people actually publish these stories?
[3:24:02.180 --> 3:24:04.660]  How can these people actually have this debate?
[3:24:04.660 --> 3:24:07.060]  But see, Alex, that's the ultimate frustration is...
[3:24:07.700 --> 3:24:11.300]  Well, then exactly, what is it where they publish stuff where the logic shows it's a fraud?
[3:24:12.260 --> 3:24:15.060]  I mean, but then still they just do it.
[3:24:15.060 --> 3:24:19.460]  There used to be this thing called debate, and we would have debates over major issues.
[3:24:19.460 --> 3:24:22.980]  And then people could be informed and the public could make informed decisions.
[3:24:22.980 --> 3:24:26.980]  And we could have actually logical, reasonable discussions about this.
[3:24:26.980 --> 3:24:28.180]  You don't get to debate anyone.
[3:24:28.180 --> 3:24:33.300]  Instead, everybody's censored off the Internet, including prestigious medical facilities to tell the truth.
[3:24:34.580 --> 3:24:35.540]  And, you know, it kind of...
[3:24:35.540 --> 3:24:38.500]  In a way, I think it goes back to what the doctor said.
[3:24:38.500 --> 3:24:43.300]  And it kind of reminded me of something that I experienced growing up when I was a young professional,
[3:24:43.300 --> 3:24:48.100]  how it's this new thing where everything has to be by the system for the system.
[3:24:48.100 --> 3:24:50.100]  And anything outside of the system or not...
[3:24:50.100 --> 3:24:52.500]  And the system comes down from the Davos Group.
[3:24:52.500 --> 3:24:56.420]  The UN, the corporations say it doesn't matter if it doesn't make sense,
[3:24:56.420 --> 3:24:58.340]  it doesn't matter if it's bad, we just do it.
[3:24:58.340 --> 3:25:03.780]  I remember when I first got started in media, specifically at a company that owned a magazine
[3:25:03.780 --> 3:25:06.500]  and a talk radio station, and I was a writer at the time.
[3:25:06.500 --> 3:25:08.740]  So I thought, okay, maybe I would go that direction,
[3:25:08.740 --> 3:25:12.740]  ended up getting involved in talk radio and just fell in love, never looked back.
[3:25:12.740 --> 3:25:17.460]  And I remember by the time I was two years in, by the time I was 22 years old,
[3:25:18.020 --> 3:25:22.020]  23 years old, all the top radio hosts in St. Louis wanted me as their producer.
[3:25:22.020 --> 3:25:23.700]  They wanted me as their fill-in host.
[3:25:23.700 --> 3:25:27.380]  And I had to sit there and deal with envy and jealousy and hatred from these guys
[3:25:27.380 --> 3:25:29.940]  that had been around five, 10, 20 years that hated me,
[3:25:29.940 --> 3:25:31.060]  because I basically just left it.
[3:25:31.060 --> 3:25:33.380]  But it was the thing, it was like, look, you're good at this.
[3:25:33.380 --> 3:25:35.700]  And so they said, hey, look, you're the best at this.
[3:25:35.700 --> 3:25:36.740]  I want you on the air.
[3:25:36.740 --> 3:25:38.260]  I want you being my producer.
[3:25:38.260 --> 3:25:41.860]  It was never, it was never like, oh, I want to get all, get one over these people.
[3:25:41.860 --> 3:25:42.900]  It's just, that's how it works.
[3:25:42.900 --> 3:25:47.540]  Like you were saying with, with what's his name, Adams, or was it Jackson,
[3:25:48.260 --> 3:25:49.620]  basically was an apprentice for two years.
[3:25:49.620 --> 3:25:51.060]  And they said, okay, you're a top lawyer.
[3:25:51.060 --> 3:25:52.580]  That was Andrew Jackson.
[3:25:52.580 --> 3:25:53.940]  Yeah. So I mean, that's what it is.
[3:25:53.940 --> 3:25:56.500]  It's just, hey, look, you want to win.
[3:25:57.380 --> 3:25:58.260]  I want to win.
[3:25:58.260 --> 3:25:59.140]  I want the best.
[3:25:59.140 --> 3:26:00.020]  I want the smartest.
[3:26:00.020 --> 3:26:01.620]  That's not a slight on people.
[3:26:01.620 --> 3:26:02.900]  That's just human nature.
[3:26:02.900 --> 3:26:07.380]  But that's what made America, I mean, like take Admiral Nemez became the big top admiral
[3:26:07.380 --> 3:26:09.300]  and did a great job in World War II.
[3:26:09.300 --> 3:26:13.460]  He literally was never even in the Navy, the family from Fredericksburg,
[3:26:13.460 --> 3:26:14.500]  but he did a great job.
[3:26:14.500 --> 3:26:16.820]  They advanced him not because he was some elite family,
[3:26:16.820 --> 3:26:18.660]  but because he was a really good seaman.
[3:26:18.660 --> 3:26:20.180]  But, but nowadays that's not how it works.
[3:26:20.180 --> 3:26:22.980]  They just appoint all their kids and they're a bunch of idiots.
[3:26:23.620 --> 3:26:27.380]  And then, you know, as you've always said, the rising tide raises all ships.
[3:26:27.380 --> 3:26:30.500]  So you want, I've always been like, I want to see other people successful.
[3:26:30.500 --> 3:26:31.300]  That brings me up.
[3:26:31.300 --> 3:26:32.980]  I'm like, yeah, like be successful.
[3:26:32.980 --> 3:26:34.420]  Hey, let me help you be successful.
[3:26:34.420 --> 3:26:36.020]  Then you can kind of pay it forward.
[3:26:36.020 --> 3:26:40.100]  But you know, there was a, there was a statement that came out of the State Department today
[3:26:40.100 --> 3:26:42.580]  and they posted it on their social media.
[3:26:42.580 --> 3:26:45.140]  I don't know if anybody covered it as far as a news story and they say, oh,
[3:26:46.740 --> 3:26:48.980]  diversity is America's strength.
[3:26:48.980 --> 3:26:53.460]  And it, and it shows about all these different Olympic athletes and there's Asian Americans,
[3:26:53.460 --> 3:26:56.660]  black Americans, white Americans, brown Americans, all this stuff.
[3:26:56.660 --> 3:26:58.900]  And they say, see, this is why diversity is so good.
[3:26:59.380 --> 3:27:01.140]  And you're completely missing the picture.
[3:27:01.140 --> 3:27:03.700]  It's a complete swing and a miss, like not even close.
[3:27:03.700 --> 3:27:05.780]  Like the, the curve ball is in the dirt.
[3:27:05.780 --> 3:27:09.700]  Like it bounced before the plate and you swung for the fences, not even close.
[3:27:10.020 --> 3:27:12.340]  No, freedom is what did it.
[3:27:12.660 --> 3:27:17.380]  It has nothing to do with skin color or race or background.
[3:27:17.380 --> 3:27:18.980]  It's freedom.
[3:27:18.980 --> 3:27:20.740]  Freedom is our strength.
[3:27:20.740 --> 3:27:26.660]  That's why anybody of any skin color, of any whatever can come here and be successful.
[3:27:26.660 --> 3:27:27.860]  It's freedom.
[3:27:27.860 --> 3:27:29.220]  It's freedom, Alex.
[3:27:29.220 --> 3:27:30.020]  It's freedom.
[3:27:30.020 --> 3:27:34.420]  Instead, they want to make it all what group you're in so that you control the group leaders.
[3:27:34.420 --> 3:27:36.020]  And so you don't have an identity.
[3:27:36.020 --> 3:27:38.820]  You simply follow the identity they put out and they demand.
[3:27:38.820 --> 3:27:41.460]  So, so what do you make of what we thought?
[3:27:41.460 --> 3:27:43.140]  Oh, sorry, there'll be new variants.
[3:27:43.140 --> 3:27:44.420]  You need monthly shots.
[3:27:44.420 --> 3:27:45.860]  We knew that was coming.
[3:27:45.860 --> 3:27:48.100]  It's just another element of the clown world, Alex.
[3:27:48.100 --> 3:27:50.100]  I mean, you cannot make sense of it.
[3:27:50.100 --> 3:27:52.100]  It's, it's, it's nonsensical.
[3:27:52.100 --> 3:27:55.780]  You just have to sit here and say, we're in the end times.
[3:27:55.780 --> 3:27:57.780]  The Bible warned us about this.
[3:27:57.780 --> 3:27:59.140]  I don't want to admit it.
[3:27:59.140 --> 3:28:01.140]  I don't want to think that hell is about to rain down.
[3:28:01.140 --> 3:28:04.580]  I don't want to think we're about to see an apocalypse here, but I mean, good Lord,
[3:28:04.580 --> 3:28:05.780]  the vaccines are killing people.
[3:28:05.780 --> 3:28:07.060]  They say it's safe and effective.
[3:28:07.060 --> 3:28:08.500]  They admit the vaccine isn't effective.
[3:28:08.500 --> 3:28:09.940]  They say you need to take three.
[3:28:09.940 --> 3:28:13.540]  They just announced today, I have the document on my desk, I'm going to cover it on the war room.
[3:28:13.540 --> 3:28:17.300]  The FDA put out their document where they're saying, oh, we're approving the vaccines just
[3:28:17.300 --> 3:28:21.220]  like we, I mean, I sat right here at this desk with Alex Jones a month ago and we said in
[3:28:21.220 --> 3:28:24.580]  one month they're going to mandate the vaccines because they know that the FDA approval is
[3:28:24.580 --> 3:28:25.580]  coming.
[3:28:25.580 --> 3:28:26.580]  Boom.
[3:28:26.580 --> 3:28:27.580]  Just like that.
[3:28:27.580 --> 3:28:28.580]  It happened.
[3:28:28.580 --> 3:28:32.980]  But oh, Alex, when do you think the FDA is going to be releasing their studies on these
[3:28:32.980 --> 3:28:33.980]  vaccines?
[3:28:33.980 --> 3:28:38.180]  When do, when do years from now years from now, in fact, I believe the earliest is 2023
[3:28:38.180 --> 3:28:39.180]  through 2025.
[3:28:39.180 --> 3:28:47.660]  So they haven't done the trials, you're the trial right now, tens of thousands of people
[3:28:47.660 --> 3:28:49.860]  are dying and they're not going to mandate this.
[3:28:49.860 --> 3:28:52.140]  It's all, it's, it's already secretly pre-tested.
[3:28:52.140 --> 3:28:53.140]  It's a kill weapon.
[3:28:53.140 --> 3:28:59.380]  Let's come back and talk about Trump and a lot more, stay with us.
[3:28:59.380 --> 3:29:04.380]  You know, listeners call into the show when they thank me and it makes me feel pathetic
[3:29:04.380 --> 3:29:10.020]  because I sit there and I beg you for support constantly for prayer, for financial support,
[3:29:10.020 --> 3:29:14.620]  and for word of mouth, and then we're all this together and I, you know, it gets old
[3:29:14.620 --> 3:29:17.540]  having to come to you and say, Hey, I got great products, please buy them or we won't
[3:29:17.540 --> 3:29:18.540]  be here on air.
[3:29:18.540 --> 3:29:21.980]  But it's true for the only media organization in the United States that promotes liberty
[3:29:21.980 --> 3:29:26.620]  at this level that is not beholden to big corporate sponsors and they've harassed and
[3:29:26.620 --> 3:29:30.340]  almost shut down everybody else, they crippled all the other groups and we're still here
[3:29:30.340 --> 3:29:35.060]  and as this whole new world order comes out and we open, our credibility is going up.
[3:29:35.060 --> 3:29:36.620]  That's why we've got to be taken off air.
[3:29:36.620 --> 3:29:38.700]  That's why America has got to be taken down.
[3:29:38.700 --> 3:29:43.100]  You can't have all these other nations enslaved and America still quasi-free.
[3:29:43.100 --> 3:29:47.020]  You can't have info wars has been proven right, being on air with all the craziness that's
[3:29:47.020 --> 3:29:48.020]  about to unfold.
[3:29:48.020 --> 3:29:50.300]  Because if you think stuff's bad now, just get ready.
[3:29:50.300 --> 3:29:55.380]  So thank you all and get an infowarstore.com, get some great 2020 election shirts, supplements
[3:29:55.380 --> 3:29:56.380]  and so much more.
[3:29:56.380 --> 3:29:59.940]  They're wonderful products and they support the info we're thanking.
[3:29:59.940 --> 3:30:04.780]  So when I first started taking survival skills, basically I was 275 pounds, I was overweight.
[3:30:04.780 --> 3:30:07.180]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe.
[3:30:07.180 --> 3:30:11.700]  I was barely holding on to a job and I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it.
[3:30:11.700 --> 3:30:16.260]  So the first one I got was the original survival shield, the X1 and it worked pretty good.
[3:30:16.260 --> 3:30:19.340]  And then shortly thereafter you came out with that too, you had, you know, with a deep
[3:30:19.340 --> 3:30:22.780]  burden source, you know, and I got really excited about that so I took it and man, in
[3:30:22.780 --> 3:30:28.620]  two weeks I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened.
[3:30:28.620 --> 3:30:33.460]  You know, I could think again, I could connect with people again and over the course of the
[3:30:33.460 --> 3:30:37.660]  next couple of years I got my health back and I religiously take basically all of your
[3:30:37.660 --> 3:30:38.660]  supplements.
[3:30:38.660 --> 3:30:40.660]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[3:30:40.660 --> 3:30:42.500]  The one I like recently is knockout.
[3:30:42.500 --> 3:30:44.780]  It literally like if you want to sleep, just take it.
[3:30:44.780 --> 3:30:45.780]  It's amazing.
[3:30:45.780 --> 3:30:46.780]  It works.
[3:30:46.780 --> 3:30:48.340]  But anyway, so the point is we have to get ourselves clean.
[3:30:48.340 --> 3:30:52.940]  That's a break free of the globalist system and the only way to do that is to take our
[3:30:52.940 --> 3:30:54.700]  own health into our own hands.
[3:30:54.700 --> 3:30:59.620]  Beautifully said, brother, I thank you so much for your call and Godspeed.
[3:30:59.620 --> 3:31:04.420]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone
[3:31:04.420 --> 3:31:07.140]  from beta testing to operational.
[3:31:07.140 --> 3:31:11.900]  The globalists are out on the open with their planetary depopulation takeover, their robot
[3:31:11.900 --> 3:31:12.900]  takeover.
[3:31:12.900 --> 3:31:16.300]  But the good news is we've been working and you've been working and others have been working
[3:31:16.300 --> 3:31:20.940]  across the planet for decades to get ready for this, to be able to find it off.
[3:31:20.940 --> 3:31:22.060]  Humanity is strong.
[3:31:22.060 --> 3:31:23.060]  We're incredible.
[3:31:23.060 --> 3:31:26.740]  If we're aware of the attack that's happening, we have a real chance of defeating it.
[3:31:26.740 --> 3:31:29.220]  If we ask God for guidance, we will defeat it.
[3:31:29.220 --> 3:31:30.940]  So prayer is essential.
[3:31:30.940 --> 3:31:31.940]  Research is essential.
[3:31:31.940 --> 3:31:35.140]  Getting prepared is essential and warning others is absolutely essential.
[3:31:35.140 --> 3:31:39.700]  And at the same time, supporting Info Wars by buying high quality products to keep us
[3:31:39.700 --> 3:31:43.380]  on air is essential because they're great products for you and your family and they're
[3:31:43.380 --> 3:31:45.540]  also funding our operation.
[3:31:45.540 --> 3:31:50.100]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsStore.com is incredible.
[3:31:50.100 --> 3:31:53.060]  A lot of our products that have been sold out because of supply chain breakdowns are
[3:31:53.060 --> 3:31:55.500]  back in like bodies, vasobetes and others.
[3:31:55.500 --> 3:32:00.340]  So get them today at InfoWarsStore.com and I thank you for being part of the resistance.
[3:32:00.340 --> 3:32:04.020]  Not all vitamin and mineral supplements are equal.
[3:32:04.020 --> 3:32:05.020]  Many of them are synthetic.
[3:32:05.020 --> 3:32:07.100]  Many of them have fillers and additives.
[3:32:07.100 --> 3:32:09.580]  Many of them just pass right through the body and are not absorbed.
[3:32:09.580 --> 3:32:14.740]  But that's not the case with our incredibly popular because it's so effective product
[3:32:14.740 --> 3:32:18.580]  that has now been sold out for months, but it's finally back in stock.
[3:32:18.580 --> 3:32:21.460]  And that is vitamin, mineral fusion.
[3:32:21.460 --> 3:32:25.780]  All the essential vitamins, all the essential minerals, a bunch of chemino acids to help
[3:32:25.780 --> 3:32:28.540]  it upload better into your body and your cells.
[3:32:28.540 --> 3:32:29.540]  It's in powder form.
[3:32:29.540 --> 3:32:30.540]  It's great for children.
[3:32:30.540 --> 3:32:31.540]  It's great for adults.
[3:32:31.540 --> 3:32:35.540]  It's really important for folks that are older because they don't absorb as well through
[3:32:35.540 --> 3:32:36.540]  their guts.
[3:32:36.540 --> 3:32:38.540]  So this liquid formula really, really does it.
[3:32:38.540 --> 3:32:42.420]  You mix up a picture of it every couple of days, put it in the refrigerator or keep it
[3:32:42.420 --> 3:32:46.300]  out in the kitchen and just remember to drink it in the morning and in the evening.
[3:32:46.300 --> 3:32:47.300]  It tastes great.
[3:32:47.300 --> 3:32:52.300]  It makes your body healthy, it boosts your immune system, and it funds the InfoWare.
[3:32:52.300 --> 3:32:57.180]  A true 360 win, so vitamin, mineral fusion sold out for months is back in stock for a
[3:32:57.180 --> 3:33:02.900]  limited time, 33% off InfoWareStore.com.
[3:33:02.900 --> 3:33:14.580]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:33:14.580 --> 3:33:15.580]  Welcome back.
[3:33:15.580 --> 3:33:19.140]  There's a man going round taking names.
[3:33:19.140 --> 3:33:25.020]  Well, there's the headline, Martin, and it's in the one in Telegraph, the BBC, the New
[3:33:25.020 --> 3:33:30.460]  York Times, Washington Post, it's in hundreds, not thousands of publications.
[3:33:30.460 --> 3:33:38.340]  Frustrated Alex Jones calls Donald Trump a dumbass after he recommends taking COVID vaccines.
[3:33:38.340 --> 3:33:39.660]  Well, let's unpack that.
[3:33:39.660 --> 3:33:40.660]  It's not a vaccine.
[3:33:40.660 --> 3:33:42.740]  It's a gene therapy.
[3:33:42.740 --> 3:33:43.740]  It was never authorized.
[3:33:43.740 --> 3:33:48.580]  Now, they've skipped the trials and criminally authorized it.
[3:33:48.580 --> 3:33:54.060]  And Trump says in the speech where he was booed that it works.
[3:33:54.060 --> 3:34:03.020]  Well, I've got the article here out of Forbes, Pfizer's shot just has 39% effective.
[3:34:03.020 --> 3:34:07.620]  And here's the CEO of Pfizer saying, oh, it's not really effective, but don't worry, we
[3:34:07.620 --> 3:34:10.140]  have more shots that aren't effective.
[3:34:10.140 --> 3:34:12.460]  So here's the deal.
[3:34:12.460 --> 3:34:13.460]  I like Trump.
[3:34:13.460 --> 3:34:14.460]  There was one after him.
[3:34:14.460 --> 3:34:18.340]  He wanted to control the borders, wanted to stand up to China, but he can't admit when
[3:34:18.340 --> 3:34:19.340]  he's wrong.
[3:34:19.340 --> 3:34:21.460]  And so I said, is he evil?
[3:34:21.460 --> 3:34:23.460]  Does he know he's lying?
[3:34:23.460 --> 3:34:27.700]  I think he's smart, but maybe he is a dumbass.
[3:34:27.700 --> 3:34:32.220]  So I didn't call Trump a dumbass and I'm not backtracking from what I said.
[3:34:32.220 --> 3:34:33.900]  The media just edits the quote.
[3:34:33.900 --> 3:34:37.060]  I said, I think he's really smart.
[3:34:37.060 --> 3:34:38.060]  So is he evil?
[3:34:38.060 --> 3:34:39.660]  Why would he lie to us like this?
[3:34:39.660 --> 3:34:41.780]  Or maybe he is just a dumbass.
[3:34:41.780 --> 3:34:45.500]  That's really a question, Owen, not saying he's a dumbass, I'm saying, this is a big
[3:34:45.500 --> 3:34:46.500]  problem.
[3:34:46.500 --> 3:34:51.140]  Well, and there's a image from that rally when he mentions the vaccine.
[3:34:51.140 --> 3:34:54.660]  And I think it's kind of powerful where he's like, oh, I got the vaccine and he reaches
[3:34:54.660 --> 3:34:55.660]  and grabs his arm.
[3:34:55.660 --> 3:34:58.380]  He kind of makes a pain face like this.
[3:34:58.380 --> 3:35:01.180]  And when you freeze frame it, to me, that image is very powerful because that's what
[3:35:01.180 --> 3:35:02.180]  it is.
[3:35:02.180 --> 3:35:03.180]  It's the globalist.
[3:35:03.180 --> 3:35:04.700]  It's the globalist poison.
[3:35:04.700 --> 3:35:06.700]  It's the medical tyranny.
[3:35:06.700 --> 3:35:09.500]  It's, oh, you know, like you're getting the pain like, yeah, this hurts.
[3:35:09.500 --> 3:35:11.380]  This medical tyranny hurts, man.
[3:35:11.380 --> 3:35:12.380]  It's not good.
[3:35:12.380 --> 3:35:15.300]  So I don't know if he maybe did that intentionally, I don't think, but I think that that was a
[3:35:15.300 --> 3:35:17.980]  powerful image from that.
[3:35:17.980 --> 3:35:23.860]  And it was definitely a dumbass move to promote it to his base that he should have known was
[3:35:23.860 --> 3:35:26.300]  not going to take that very well.
[3:35:26.300 --> 3:35:27.580]  And then you had Mike Pence.
[3:35:27.580 --> 3:35:30.340]  And I think this really tells the story.
[3:35:30.340 --> 3:35:34.940]  And maybe it's this political hubris, but Mike Pence put out a statement, basically
[3:35:34.940 --> 3:35:39.380]  talking about how great it is that the vaccines have been approved by the FDA, how great the
[3:35:39.380 --> 3:35:42.620]  vaccine operation warp speed has been.
[3:35:42.620 --> 3:35:45.780]  And then, of course, he and he takes credit for it with with Trump, he says, yes, me and
[3:35:45.780 --> 3:35:46.780]  Trump did this.
[3:35:46.780 --> 3:35:48.620]  You can thank us basically.
[3:35:48.620 --> 3:35:52.540]  And they don't understand that it's their very base that is the 50% that is refusing
[3:35:52.540 --> 3:35:53.540]  vaccine.
[3:35:53.540 --> 3:35:55.340]  Oh, but they do.
[3:35:55.340 --> 3:35:57.100]  This is an establishment move.
[3:35:57.100 --> 3:35:59.220]  Pence does it because he's an establishment guy.
[3:35:59.220 --> 3:36:03.660]  Trump does it because he's proud of it and thinks he's going to be blamed if it's wrong.
[3:36:03.660 --> 3:36:06.900]  And I think that there's still a little bit of.
[3:36:06.900 --> 3:36:13.980]  I mean, I got to tell you, Alex, I'm not denying that immunization works, natural immunity
[3:36:13.980 --> 3:36:14.980]  is the best.
[3:36:14.980 --> 3:36:18.260]  I'm not going to deny that there's science behind vaccines.
[3:36:18.260 --> 3:36:20.660]  It's my personal choice not to get it.
[3:36:20.660 --> 3:36:24.900]  But I got to tell you, I mean, seeing all the lies that they've told us about COVID,
[3:36:24.900 --> 3:36:28.860]  I mean, I'm looking back on all of this stuff and I'm like, maybe we should have never been
[3:36:28.860 --> 3:36:30.020]  afraid of any of it.
[3:36:30.020 --> 3:36:31.140]  Well, that's the thing.
[3:36:31.140 --> 3:36:36.500]  This is not a classic inoculation and all the problems with the former ones and all
[3:36:36.500 --> 3:36:39.420]  the scandals act like it's just been some wondrous story.
[3:36:39.420 --> 3:36:41.420]  Guys, get the Brian Williams clip ready.
[3:36:41.420 --> 3:36:43.660]  I saw some tick tock video.
[3:36:43.660 --> 3:36:44.660]  Somebody sent me.
[3:36:44.660 --> 3:36:46.500]  It's got a bunch of weird stuff the kids put on there.
[3:36:46.500 --> 3:36:51.140]  But that's all Brian Williams, who says he was shot down in a helicopter.
[3:36:51.140 --> 3:36:52.140]  The RPG hit it.
[3:36:52.140 --> 3:36:53.140]  They crashed.
[3:36:53.140 --> 3:36:54.300]  Nobody was shot at.
[3:36:54.300 --> 3:36:55.700]  No helicopters got shot at.
[3:36:55.700 --> 3:36:56.860]  It's a lie.
[3:36:56.860 --> 3:36:59.620]  Brian Williams is the NBC fact checker.
[3:36:59.620 --> 3:37:04.100]  That'd be like, again, having a convicted pedophile run your preschool.
[3:37:04.100 --> 3:37:07.580]  You know, it's equivalent of having this guy as your fact checker.
[3:37:07.580 --> 3:37:11.140]  He brings up Sandy Hook like, oh, we talk about Sandy Hook so much.
[3:37:11.140 --> 3:37:15.420]  Something I talked about like 15 times six, seven, eight years ago, the Internet questioned
[3:37:15.420 --> 3:37:16.420]  it.
[3:37:16.420 --> 3:37:17.420]  I questioned it.
[3:37:17.420 --> 3:37:21.940]  And so they attached my identity to that and always go, oh, Jones said the mass shooting
[3:37:21.940 --> 3:37:22.940]  didn't happen.
[3:37:22.940 --> 3:37:26.740]  Well, was small it.
[3:37:26.740 --> 3:37:27.740]  Fake is hanging.
[3:37:27.740 --> 3:37:31.860]  Did they fake babies and incubators to start the Iraq war?
[3:37:31.860 --> 3:37:38.180]  Did ABC News show footage at the Nob Creek machine gun shootout and say it was, say it
[3:37:38.180 --> 3:37:41.700]  was people blowing up villages in Syria?
[3:37:41.700 --> 3:37:44.340]  The point is, yes, we all have a right to question things.
[3:37:44.340 --> 3:37:45.340]  That's our free speech.
[3:37:45.340 --> 3:37:49.660]  I've gotten a few things wrong, not on purpose, unlike Brian Williams.
[3:37:49.660 --> 3:37:53.300]  Did I ever get up there and say I was shot down in a helicopter?
[3:37:53.300 --> 3:37:55.780]  Did I say I was a hero that an RPG at my helicopter?
[3:37:55.780 --> 3:37:56.780]  No, I didn't.
[3:37:56.780 --> 3:38:04.740]  So here he is, this criminal slime bag sitting there, gloating over, oh, Jones has attacked
[3:38:04.740 --> 3:38:05.740]  Trump.
[3:38:05.740 --> 3:38:10.100]  And then he acts like it's something new that Roger Stone doesn't like Steve Bannon when
[3:38:10.100 --> 3:38:11.620]  Steve Bannon testified against him.
[3:38:11.620 --> 3:38:12.620]  I'm staying out of it.
[3:38:12.620 --> 3:38:13.860]  I like the work of Steve Bannon.
[3:38:13.860 --> 3:38:17.420]  He's a really smart guy and I'm friends with Roger too.
[3:38:17.420 --> 3:38:18.420]  I just want to stay out of it.
[3:38:18.420 --> 3:38:23.460]  But the point is, this is them gleefully, them him closing out NBC News last night.
[3:38:23.460 --> 3:38:28.260]  Last thing before we go tonight, as someone put it on Twitter today, the rats are eating
[3:38:28.260 --> 3:38:29.260]  each other.
[3:38:29.260 --> 3:38:31.140]  Let's explain and here's what we mean.
[3:38:31.140 --> 3:38:37.420]  Alex Jones, who sits at the very top of the conspiracy theory aristocracy in the United
[3:38:37.420 --> 3:38:44.740]  States, Alex Jones of Info Wars, a platinum status anti-vaxxer, appears to have turned
[3:38:44.740 --> 3:38:50.940]  on Donald Trump, who this weekend, as we showed you in Alabama, gave the most cursory endorsement
[3:38:50.940 --> 3:38:59.220]  of the vaccine, being created a vaccine, they create a Frankenstein, now they got you signed
[3:38:59.220 --> 3:39:00.220]  up to it.
[3:39:00.220 --> 3:39:04.100]  Now the less say you better get out there and push it and you are seeing it comes out
[3:39:04.100 --> 3:39:08.140]  and says, we need to see Trump come out a couple of shots and within weeks of them saying
[3:39:08.140 --> 3:39:13.540]  over and over again, seeing it snaps their fingers, Jeff Zucker snaps his fingers and
[3:39:13.540 --> 3:39:17.940]  Trump clicks his heels and hops up their attention and says, how do you want me to
[3:39:17.940 --> 3:39:23.980]  jump, boss, shame on you, Trump, seriously, hey, if you don't have the good sense to save
[3:39:23.980 --> 3:39:27.060]  yourself your political career, that's okay, at least you're gonna get some good Republicans
[3:39:27.060 --> 3:39:32.140]  elected and you know, we like you, but my God, maybe you're not that bright, maybe Trump's
[3:39:32.140 --> 3:39:35.660]  actually a dumbass.
[3:39:35.660 --> 3:39:40.420]  So when you've lost Alex Jones, you've lost the man who said the parents of the dead children
[3:39:40.420 --> 3:39:45.940]  at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut were crisis actors and that the whole thing
[3:39:45.940 --> 3:39:48.580]  was staged by the federal government.
[3:39:48.580 --> 3:39:55.180]  And quote the late Ron Popeal here, but wait, there's more, Roger Stone has turned on Steve
[3:39:55.180 --> 3:40:01.260]  Bannon, you might want to pull up a chair for this one, Roger Stone wrote this on Friday,
[3:40:01.260 --> 3:40:07.220]  complete with some typos that you'll see and we quote, Robert Mueller informant and perjurer,
[3:40:07.220 --> 3:40:11.580]  Steve Bannon doesn't know his ass from his elbow, Steve didn't make money on Wall Street,
[3:40:11.580 --> 3:40:17.260]  nor did he make money in Hollywood, he's a grifter, a fat, ugly, inarticulate, poorly
[3:40:17.260 --> 3:40:22.780]  groomed alcoholic with delusions of grandeur, he has never elected anybody to any public
[3:40:22.780 --> 3:40:28.260]  office in his life, most particularly not Donald Trump, who is his own man in implemented
[3:40:28.260 --> 3:40:30.180]  his own strategy.
[3:40:30.180 --> 3:40:34.060]  Despite being an informant for Robert Mueller, they indicted him anyway and he will soon
[3:40:34.060 --> 3:40:40.460]  be recharged in New York on new charges, you'll see me as his trial in the front row and I
[3:40:40.460 --> 3:40:45.940]  will not leave until he is convicted and jailed.
[3:40:45.940 --> 3:40:49.260]  So there they are gleefully like we're fighting with each other, and here's the deal, we're
[3:40:49.260 --> 3:40:53.780]  not the cult, exactly, we're free Americans that debate and have different ideas.
[3:40:53.780 --> 3:40:57.060]  Well I was going to say if anything I think that that clip would make you look good, I
[3:40:57.060 --> 3:41:02.020]  mean I guess I shouldn't be surprised by, I think I counted just five or six blatant
[3:41:02.020 --> 3:41:07.220]  lies, Brian Williams, I mean just flat out lies, I mean can you imagine, like you know
[3:41:07.220 --> 3:41:11.060]  sometimes the crew will sit there and you know you'll go on a great rant or something
[3:41:11.060 --> 3:41:14.420]  or I'll go on a great rant and say hey you know that was good, good job, that was powerful.
[3:41:14.420 --> 3:41:18.660]  Imagine the crew behind Brian Williams like wow this guy can just go on TV and lie, like
[3:41:18.660 --> 3:41:22.260]  nobody's business, I mean wow he just went up there and just said a flat out lie like
[3:41:22.260 --> 3:41:26.140]  hey good job Brian, way to lie to the whole world, like that's impressive.
[3:41:26.140 --> 3:41:30.940]  Over a few of the lies, I don't even, I mean everything he said pretty much was a complete
[3:41:30.940 --> 3:41:36.940]  lie, but again how do they sit here and say you're in a cult, you know you're this, you're
[3:41:36.940 --> 3:41:41.620]  that, you're controlled by this, you're controlled by that, we just go with wherever reality goes,
[3:41:41.620 --> 3:41:45.420]  we just go wherever the truth goes, we just go wherever justice goes, if Trump is right,
[3:41:45.420 --> 3:41:48.420]  Trump is right, if Trump is wrong, Trump is wrong, if Bill Maher is right, Bill Maher
[3:41:48.420 --> 3:41:52.100]  is right, you know we'll always give credit where credit is due, I think I got another
[3:41:52.100 --> 3:41:56.300]  video of somebody who I don't, oh yeah like Spike Lee, Spike Lee, I'm no fan of Spike
[3:41:56.300 --> 3:42:00.740]  Lee, I believe Spike Lee is right, but now he's gonna do 9-11's an inside job, good,
[3:42:00.740 --> 3:42:05.380]  good Spike Lee, expose 9-11 please, he's a day late and about 20 years short but at
[3:42:05.380 --> 3:42:09.420]  least he's doing it. So that's what I'm saying, hey if the, if the, if the guy's right, then
[3:42:09.420 --> 3:42:13.740]  the guy's right, I may not like him, I may not agree with him barely ever, but hey, if
[3:42:13.740 --> 3:42:16.820]  he's gonna, if he- Good point, you can see that's what I was gonna say today about it,
[3:42:16.820 --> 3:42:21.020]  it's up on infowars.com, Hollywood director Spike Lee says he had questions about investigation
[3:42:21.020 --> 3:42:26.620]  9-11 attacks, we're gonna come back in the final segment, Owen, you were given some rules
[3:42:26.620 --> 3:42:31.540]  not to talk with other January 6 people about what happened, I don't know how they do that
[3:42:31.540 --> 3:42:35.380]  but you're a talk show host and I'm a talk show host, but it's all on document cam, it's
[3:42:35.380 --> 3:42:41.700]  all on body cam, it's all on video, so we're not talking about what happened on January
[3:42:41.700 --> 3:42:45.700]  6th, getting our stories straight here, when our story is just the truth, but I wanna know
[3:42:45.700 --> 3:42:50.780]  how jail went yesterday and the court case, folks want to know about that, so we'll discuss
[3:42:50.780 --> 3:42:58.700]  it all on the other side and a lot more, final segment straight ahead.
[3:42:58.700 --> 3:43:03.740]  We here at InfoWars are proud to announce the first ever Kava Kava root supplement that

[3:43:13.580 --> 3:43:17.980]  Pacific Islands for its relaxation and euphoric effects.
[3:43:17.980 --> 3:43:23.420]  According to ancient Samoan legend, Kava was given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa, who
[3:43:23.420 --> 3:43:27.700]  they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe.
[3:43:27.700 --> 3:43:32.380]  The Samoan people would drink Kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to
[3:43:32.380 --> 3:43:33.700]  loosen up a little.
[3:43:33.700 --> 3:43:38.500]  Nowadays, Kava is used around the world by many who enjoy its serious benefits.

[3:44:02.940 --> 3:44:03.940]  Hello, can you hear me?
[3:44:03.940 --> 3:44:04.940]  I sure can, sir, thank you.
[3:44:04.940 --> 3:44:10.260]  Hey, Alex, before I start, man, I just wanted to talk to you, bro, and it's a pleasure to
[3:44:10.260 --> 3:44:11.260]  be talking right now, here, man.
[3:44:11.260 --> 3:44:12.260]  Sir, it's an honor to talk to you, brother.
[3:44:12.260 --> 3:44:13.260]  I'm Juan, your friend, in Connecticut, and I just want to plug in.
[3:44:13.260 --> 3:44:14.260]  I'm a truck driver, and two before us have changed the way I drive.
[3:44:14.260 --> 3:44:15.260]  Me and my brothers that drive, there's a couple of us, we're all Hispanics, Cubans,
[3:44:15.260 --> 3:44:30.260]  Puerto Ricans, we used to be on Monster, and Red Bull, and Rolla, and I have lost weight
[3:44:30.260 --> 3:44:36.820]  because I stopped drinking all that sugar, and I just want to thank you for that, man.
[3:44:36.820 --> 3:44:41.540]  Well, brother, we put more in this than any other long-term, high-quality energy powder
[3:44:41.540 --> 3:44:45.220]  there is, so this was designed on one of the top guys in the country, you didn't want to
[3:44:45.220 --> 3:44:48.020]  put his name on it because, obviously, the political issues, but we had to pay a lot
[3:44:48.020 --> 3:44:51.700]  of money for this formulation just for the design of it, and we believe it is the best,
[3:44:51.700 --> 3:44:55.500]  strongest, but healthiest energy out there, and you're saying that it's made your life
[3:44:55.500 --> 3:44:56.940]  better, so that means a lot to me, thank you.

[3:46:00.540 --> 3:46:04.220]  Not all vitamin and mineral supplements are equal.
[3:46:04.220 --> 3:46:05.220]  Many of them are synthetic.
[3:46:05.220 --> 3:46:07.260]  Many of them have fillers and additives.
[3:46:07.260 --> 3:46:09.900]  Many of them just pass right through the body and are not absorbed.
[3:46:09.900 --> 3:46:14.900]  Well, that's not the case with our incredibly popular, because it's so effective product
[3:46:14.900 --> 3:46:18.900]  that it's now been sold out for months, but it's finally back in stone.
[3:46:18.900 --> 3:46:21.660]  And that is vitamin, mineral fusion.
[3:46:21.660 --> 3:46:25.980]  All the essential vitamins, all the essential minerals, a bunch of key amino acids to help
[3:46:25.980 --> 3:46:28.740]  it upload better into your body and your cells.
[3:46:28.740 --> 3:46:29.740]  It's in powder form.
[3:46:29.740 --> 3:46:30.740]  It's great for children.
[3:46:30.740 --> 3:46:31.740]  It's great for adults.
[3:46:31.740 --> 3:46:35.740]  It's really important for folks that are older, because they don't absorb as well through
[3:46:35.740 --> 3:46:36.740]  their guts.
[3:46:36.740 --> 3:46:38.740]  So this liquid formula really, really does it.
[3:46:38.740 --> 3:46:42.500]  It makes up a picture of it every couple of days, put it in the refrigerator, or keep
[3:46:42.500 --> 3:46:43.500]  it out in the kitchen.
[3:46:43.500 --> 3:46:46.500]  And just remember to drink it in the morning and in the evening.
[3:46:46.500 --> 3:46:47.500]  It tastes great.
[3:46:47.500 --> 3:46:48.500]  It makes your body healthy.
[3:46:48.500 --> 3:46:52.620]  It boosts your immune system, and it funds the end full war.
[3:46:52.620 --> 3:46:57.540]  A true 361, so vitamin, mineral fusion sold out for months is back in stone for a limited
[3:46:57.540 --> 3:46:58.540]  time.
[3:46:58.540 --> 3:47:15.500]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:47:15.500 --> 3:47:28.460]  Folks, I want to explain to everybody what the Havana syndrome is.
[3:47:28.460 --> 3:47:33.340]  Because Kamala Harris has delayed her trip to Vietnam over it.
[3:47:33.340 --> 3:47:35.540]  You want me to pop in the first segment of your show to talk about this?
[3:47:35.540 --> 3:47:37.740]  Because we're out of time, and I can do it on my show tomorrow.
[3:47:37.740 --> 3:47:38.740]  Sure.
[3:47:38.740 --> 3:47:39.740]  Come on in.
[3:47:39.740 --> 3:47:40.740]  All right.

[3:47:43.740 --> 3:47:45.180]  is TV stations everywhere.
[3:47:45.180 --> 3:47:46.180]  Okay.
[3:47:46.180 --> 3:47:49.100]  Now, Owen, I said, what do you want to hit in the final segment?
[3:47:49.100 --> 3:47:52.540]  I said, obviously, you're trying to raise a quarter million dollars for criminal defense.
[3:47:52.540 --> 3:47:54.700]  That's what it will cost easily if we fight it.
[3:47:54.700 --> 3:47:55.700]  We are fighting it.
[3:47:55.700 --> 3:47:59.620]  He did not break into the Capitol using physical force as he's been charged.
[3:47:59.620 --> 3:48:01.700]  Now, he's facing at least a year in prison.
[3:48:01.700 --> 3:48:03.580]  We're not going to let that happen.
[3:48:03.580 --> 3:48:05.940]  Folks have sent $200,000 to your legal defense fund.
[3:48:05.940 --> 3:48:06.940]  That's great news.
[3:48:06.940 --> 3:48:08.620]  We want to get under $50,000.
[3:48:08.620 --> 3:48:09.820]  That should handle it.
[3:48:09.820 --> 3:48:11.740]  If folks want to go above that, that's fine.
[3:48:11.740 --> 3:48:15.540]  I think you should shoot the Huffington Post saying that you led the attack and called
[3:48:15.540 --> 3:48:16.940]  for an attack on the Capitol.
[3:48:16.940 --> 3:48:17.940]  That's open and shut.
[3:48:17.940 --> 3:48:19.620]  And now you've been charged based on that lie.
[3:48:19.620 --> 3:48:22.940]  So, but you said, no, you don't want to sue them.
[3:48:22.940 --> 3:48:24.220]  You're upset about the mask.
[3:48:24.220 --> 3:48:29.260]  Well, and we may look into other lawsuits going forward when, when some of the smoke
[3:48:29.260 --> 3:48:30.260]  starts to clear.
[3:48:30.260 --> 3:48:35.660]  But yeah, we have an executive order here from Governor Abbott that says you cannot mandate
[3:48:35.660 --> 3:48:37.660]  masks in any public buildings.
[3:48:37.660 --> 3:48:42.660]  And when I was in the federal building yesterday, I couldn't go in without putting a mask on.
[3:48:42.660 --> 3:48:45.500]  I had to wear the mask all through processing.
[3:48:45.500 --> 3:48:50.860]  They, my mask even broke at one of those, you know, medical masks, it broke.
[3:48:50.860 --> 3:48:55.060]  And so then they brought me like an even more official muzzle, like a painter's mask.
[3:48:55.060 --> 3:48:59.420]  So then I had to wear that breathing in my own carbon, breathing in my own stinky breath.
[3:48:59.420 --> 3:49:00.420]  Totally illegal.
[3:49:00.420 --> 3:49:01.420]  Totally illegal.
[3:49:01.420 --> 3:49:05.300]  And I know that our Attorney General here, Ken Paxson, who I think is the best Attorney
[3:49:05.300 --> 3:49:08.420]  General in America, by the way, I think he might be the best in America.
[3:49:08.420 --> 3:49:12.380]  Maybe Eric Schmidt, right behind that in Missouri, who just, Schmidt's awesome, who just signed
[3:49:12.380 --> 3:49:14.180]  executive orders against those mandates as well.
[3:49:14.180 --> 3:49:19.580]  But how is it that I have executive orders that you can't mandate a mask in public government
[3:49:19.580 --> 3:49:23.540]  property in Texas, and then I'm going here throughout this entire process being forced
[3:49:23.540 --> 3:49:24.540]  to wear a mask.
[3:49:24.540 --> 3:49:28.580]  And I mean, I'm locked in my cell, I obviously took it off.
[3:49:28.580 --> 3:49:33.660]  But throughout the whole process in the courtroom, everything, and the medical device.
[3:49:33.660 --> 3:49:35.340]  And they just, and they say, oh, it's mandated.
[3:49:35.340 --> 3:49:36.340]  They got their signs everywhere.
[3:49:36.340 --> 3:49:41.300]  You were saying that the judge and the bailiffs weren't wearing it, but the FBI and everybody
[3:49:41.300 --> 3:49:42.300]  else were.
[3:49:42.300 --> 3:49:44.620]  Again, they're all just opting into the slavery.
[3:49:44.620 --> 3:49:46.620]  Yeah, it's kind of interesting.
[3:49:46.620 --> 3:49:47.620]  I'm not sure.
[3:49:47.620 --> 3:49:48.620]  I never.
[3:49:48.620 --> 3:49:49.620]  I don't know.
[3:49:49.620 --> 3:49:50.620]  Let's show it.
[3:49:50.620 --> 3:49:54.740]  Pelosi, all the servants wear masks, but none of the Libs do, and the really bizarre footage.
[3:49:54.740 --> 3:49:56.340]  We have the raw footage in a minute.
[3:49:56.340 --> 3:50:00.340]  We'll play it of Schumer doing weird snake dances with Stephen Colbert.
[3:50:00.340 --> 3:50:02.220]  But go ahead, sir.
[3:50:02.220 --> 3:50:04.580]  You know, this is really a perfect example, though.
[3:50:04.580 --> 3:50:09.540]  All of Pelosi's elites, all the Democrat elites, they don't have to wear a mask.
[3:50:09.540 --> 3:50:10.620]  They go to lunch.
[3:50:10.620 --> 3:50:11.620]  They go to dinner.
[3:50:11.620 --> 3:50:13.540]  They have parties, no masks.
[3:50:13.540 --> 3:50:15.260]  But all the servers have to wear masks.
[3:50:15.260 --> 3:50:20.420]  The unwashed swine of society that's not the liberal progressive Democrat, they dominate
[3:50:20.420 --> 3:50:21.420]  you.
[3:50:21.420 --> 3:50:22.420]  This is the new caste system.
[3:50:22.420 --> 3:50:27.020]  We're building a new caste, American caste system, just like they built in Israel.
[3:50:27.020 --> 3:50:30.940]  And these liberal progressives and Democrats want to sit on top of it, telling you what
[3:50:30.940 --> 3:50:32.860]  to do, telling you what to do with them.
[3:50:32.860 --> 3:50:36.060]  And they're going to exercise the fraud that they don't wear the mask, but you do.
[3:50:36.060 --> 3:50:39.100]  Like Tucker Carlson showed San Francisco, where they were shooting people in the street
[3:50:39.100 --> 3:50:40.980]  wouldn't wear a mask during the Spanish flu.
[3:50:40.980 --> 3:50:44.580]  They now admit 80% of the deaths were from the dirty bacterial pneumonia in the mask.
[3:50:44.580 --> 3:50:47.940]  When they finally had a boxing match, there was a photo taken showing the mayor and the
[3:50:47.940 --> 3:50:50.340]  police chief and people not wearing masks.
[3:50:50.340 --> 3:50:53.980]  And that was enough nationwide to end the fake mask in 1918.
[3:50:53.980 --> 3:50:55.420]  What's that?
[3:50:55.420 --> 3:51:00.420]  Every day I see violent crime happening on the streets of Chicago, violent crime happening
[3:51:00.420 --> 3:51:03.700]  on the streets of New York City, all these cities, thousands dead a week.
[3:51:03.700 --> 3:51:06.700]  And I mean, it's like, I don't even really cover it because it's just every day.
[3:51:06.700 --> 3:51:08.700]  But it's like, Hey, that's a real thing.
[3:51:08.700 --> 3:51:10.740]  Somebody comes this background noise.
[3:51:10.740 --> 3:51:12.500]  Can you guys roll Pelosi again?
[3:51:12.500 --> 3:51:14.860]  Somebody walking around the streets of San Francisco or New York?
[3:51:14.860 --> 3:51:15.860]  You never know.
[3:51:15.860 --> 3:51:16.940]  You can get your head bashed in.
[3:51:16.940 --> 3:51:19.460]  Some guy got stabbed like a dozen times in the face.
[3:51:19.460 --> 3:51:20.460]  I mean, shoot.
[3:51:20.460 --> 3:51:21.540]  Oh, let's just say it.
[3:51:21.540 --> 3:51:24.500]  Crime is up five fold from just three years ago in blue cities.
[3:51:24.500 --> 3:51:28.300]  So if you're, I mean, Austin used to be a safe city and I'm a tough guy.
[3:51:28.300 --> 3:51:33.260]  I will not go downtown now unless I have to at a meeting and I bring a bodyguard.
[3:51:33.260 --> 3:51:36.940]  I mean, it is literally like a lunatic asylum down there.
[3:51:36.940 --> 3:51:37.940]  Look at this, Alex.
[3:51:37.940 --> 3:51:42.460]  Seven killed, 39 others wounded and weakened gun violence in Chicago.
[3:51:42.460 --> 3:51:47.100]  But, oh, they don't want to cover that because that just shows how Democrat run cities are
[3:51:47.100 --> 3:51:52.860]  just completely falling into criminal hellhole, which is the post industrial plan.
[3:51:52.860 --> 3:51:57.180]  So it's all this panic over a virus or over a mask or over a vaccine.
[3:51:57.180 --> 3:52:00.460]  But then, oh, you know, you just walk out on the streets of a major city.
[3:52:00.460 --> 3:52:01.460]  You got to watch out.
[3:52:01.460 --> 3:52:02.660]  You got to have your head on a swivel.
[3:52:02.660 --> 3:52:03.660]  All right.
[3:52:03.660 --> 3:52:05.020]  So, and let's talk about this at the time.
[3:52:05.020 --> 3:52:07.020]  People want to know about your case.
[3:52:07.020 --> 3:52:08.020]  What is it?
[3:52:08.020 --> 3:52:10.180]  DefendOwen.com DefendOwen.com is the website.
[3:52:10.180 --> 3:52:12.340]  The support that has gone to there.
[3:52:12.340 --> 3:52:14.020]  We've had over 3,000 donors.
[3:52:14.020 --> 3:52:16.020]  Last I checked, I think it was 3,200.
[3:52:16.020 --> 3:52:17.020]  It's just been incredible.
[3:52:17.020 --> 3:52:18.020]  It fills my heart.
[3:52:18.020 --> 3:52:19.860]  And this place isn't censoring us.
[3:52:19.860 --> 3:52:22.260]  Everybody doing crowdsourcing should use this place.
[3:52:22.260 --> 3:52:23.260]  Yeah.
[3:52:23.260 --> 3:52:27.220]  I was allowed to be on GoFundMe for like three hours and then they canceled it.
[3:52:27.220 --> 3:52:29.140]  So we switched to Give, Send, Go.
[3:52:29.140 --> 3:52:30.980]  It's been such a blessing.
[3:52:30.980 --> 3:52:31.980]  DefendOwen.com.
[3:52:31.980 --> 3:52:33.740]  We're almost to our goal.
[3:52:33.740 --> 3:52:35.740]  And you know, this could be a long battle.
[3:52:35.740 --> 3:52:36.740]  I hope it's short.
[3:52:36.740 --> 3:52:42.060]  I hope we can take care of this quickly and justice, you know, and my innocence will be
[3:52:42.060 --> 3:52:43.340]  proven here.
[3:52:43.340 --> 3:52:45.500]  But this could be a long thing.
[3:52:45.500 --> 3:52:49.900]  So your support there, having that financial support, having that confidence, having that
[3:52:49.900 --> 3:52:53.900]  kind of lifted that burden, lifted off my shoulder has really been huge.
[3:52:53.900 --> 3:52:54.900]  Sure.
[3:52:54.900 --> 3:52:55.900]  Let's be clear.
[3:52:55.900 --> 3:52:56.900]  I mean, I would have worked to get you the money for it.
[3:52:56.900 --> 3:52:59.020]  But I want to explain something to viewers.
[3:52:59.020 --> 3:53:04.180]  We were in the red this year until just a few months ago and then MyPillow came along.
[3:53:04.180 --> 3:53:08.020]  MyPillow.com promo code Alex, you get up to 66% off.
[3:53:08.020 --> 3:53:10.180]  And that helped us get into the black sum.
[3:53:10.180 --> 3:53:13.220]  I gave the crew the first bonus in like seven, eight months because they deserve a little
[3:53:13.220 --> 3:53:14.220]  bonus.
[3:53:14.220 --> 3:53:17.140]  That took half the extra money we had in the account.
[3:53:17.140 --> 3:53:21.140]  So when you start talking about all the Democratic lawsuits against us that we've defeated over
[3:53:21.140 --> 3:53:25.580]  30 of them, almost 40 of them, we got a few left that you see in the news and all the things
[3:53:25.580 --> 3:53:30.620]  we've paid out to stay on air and everything, it's a big deal to get lawyers to fly around
[3:53:30.620 --> 3:53:32.060]  in depositions and witnesses.
[3:53:32.060 --> 3:53:37.020]  I mean, to fight the feds in a case, they're going to spend themselves a million dollars
[3:53:37.020 --> 3:53:38.020]  trying to put Owen in jail.
[3:53:38.020 --> 3:53:41.820]  I mean, it's come out in news articles that some of the Democratic party law firms that
[3:53:41.820 --> 3:53:48.460]  have been suing me have spent up to $5 million per suit in the in the Pepe the Frog case
[3:53:48.460 --> 3:53:49.960]  against us.
[3:53:49.960 --> 3:53:53.020]  They spent over a million, $400,000 in court.
[3:53:53.020 --> 3:53:55.740]  We beat it for $100,000 in court battles.
[3:53:55.740 --> 3:54:01.100]  And the judge said, I want you guys to settle this for them for the minimum that California
[3:54:01.100 --> 3:54:02.380]  statute would pay.
[3:54:02.380 --> 3:54:07.140]  If it was federal, he said pay them $15,000.
[3:54:07.140 --> 3:54:10.260]  Or I'll basically rule against you if this goes to trial and it will cost millions.
[3:54:10.260 --> 3:54:14.860]  So I said, okay, I'll pay and settle, but I already spent $100,000 to beat their million
[3:54:14.860 --> 3:54:15.860]  plus.
[3:54:15.860 --> 3:54:23.380]  So I mean, folks, the entire Georgetown University has over a thousand lawyers suing us in Charlottesville
[3:54:23.380 --> 3:54:25.660]  saying we said stuff we didn't say.
[3:54:25.660 --> 3:54:26.660]  And that's coming up.
[3:54:26.660 --> 3:54:27.660]  That trial is coming up soon.
[3:54:27.660 --> 3:54:28.660]  That's the first one.
[3:54:28.660 --> 3:54:30.340]  So we are, and we're not victims here.
[3:54:30.340 --> 3:54:31.340]  I asked for this.
[3:54:31.340 --> 3:54:32.340]  I stepped up.
[3:54:32.340 --> 3:54:33.340]  I'm ready to die maybe.
[3:54:33.340 --> 3:54:34.340]  I mean, whatever.
[3:54:34.340 --> 3:54:36.100]  I just want to be effective to the end.
[3:54:36.100 --> 3:54:38.220]  It takes money to do this.
[3:54:38.220 --> 3:54:41.860]  We're spending millions a quarter on just bandwidth.
[3:54:41.860 --> 3:54:47.260]  I'm spending hundreds of thousands of dollars just paying for shortwave globally and other
[3:54:47.260 --> 3:54:51.540]  satellites to service Africa and Asia and places where no money comes in.
[3:54:51.540 --> 3:54:56.620]  But we get the letters and hear the comments of African villages and people in Greece and
[3:54:56.620 --> 3:55:01.980]  you know, people in Russia can see us on their satellites because we want minds.
[3:55:01.980 --> 3:55:03.660]  We want souls to wake up.
[3:55:03.660 --> 3:55:06.500]  And so you got to understand, I got a lot of stuff going on.
[3:55:06.500 --> 3:55:10.660]  And in the old days, when I could make money, I was like, oh, I was, I was funding so many
[3:55:10.660 --> 3:55:12.700]  groups of people, you know, behind the scenes.
[3:55:12.700 --> 3:55:15.780]  Now we don't fund a lot of folks behind the scenes because we're imploded down to who
[3:55:15.780 --> 3:55:16.780]  we are.
[3:55:16.780 --> 3:55:18.740]  But now our message is stronger.
[3:55:18.740 --> 3:55:20.540]  We've got more credibility than ever.
[3:55:20.540 --> 3:55:24.100]  People know we're dead on and that's why keeping us on air is so essential.
[3:55:24.100 --> 3:55:30.580]  So go to infowarstore.com and get the vitamins, the minerals, the supplements.
[3:55:30.580 --> 3:55:35.780]  You've got mineral, vitamin, mineral fusion back in stock, 33% off, get all the products
[3:55:35.780 --> 3:55:39.300]  there on the site because that's what funds us and keeps us on the air.
[3:55:39.300 --> 3:55:43.380]  And if I had a bigger war chest, we would be much more confident.
[3:55:43.380 --> 3:55:44.380]  I'm not complaining.
[3:55:44.380 --> 3:55:50.540]  I'm just saying I spend 30, 40% of my time trying to make money to fund our operation.
[3:55:50.540 --> 3:55:54.700]  I'm trying to jack with my house to fix a few things in it so I can sell it so I can
[3:55:54.700 --> 3:55:55.700]  get money to run this place.
[3:55:55.700 --> 3:55:58.940]  Because I bought a bigger, nicer house because I knew banks weren't safe and I wanted to
[3:55:58.940 --> 3:56:01.940]  increase money to have funding in the future, which is not on purpose.
[3:56:01.940 --> 3:56:04.940]  But I mean, I'm literally selling my house to fund this because you can see there's
[3:56:04.940 --> 3:56:05.940]  no future anyways.
[3:56:05.940 --> 3:56:08.380]  I'm just totally in, total commitment.
[3:56:08.380 --> 3:56:09.380]  Everything just want to win.
[3:56:09.380 --> 3:56:12.940]  Don't want to bet my whole life on this and fail, just everything, everything, everything.
[3:56:12.940 --> 3:56:16.100]  So go to infowarstore.com, get ultimate krill oil back in stock.
[3:56:16.100 --> 3:56:17.100]  It's incredible.
[3:56:17.100 --> 3:56:23.260]  40% off living defense, 40% off vasobis, 50% off, whatever you do, take action, screwing
[3:56:23.260 --> 3:56:27.780]  around and not taking action is how the enemy is going to win and you can't buy better products
[3:56:27.780 --> 3:56:32.620]  and fund a liberty movement at the same time anywhere but here, this is the place to do
[3:56:32.620 --> 3:56:33.620]  it.
