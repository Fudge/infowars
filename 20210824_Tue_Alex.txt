[00:00:02.113 --> 00:00:06.836]  Pfizer will pay $2.3 billion in civil and criminal fines.
[00:00:06.836 --> 00:00:12.640]  The criminal fine, nearly $1.2 billion, is the single largest fine in U.S.
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:13.640]  history.
[00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:14.080]  The U.S.
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.943]  government will also supervise Pfizer's behavior for the next five years.
[00:00:18.183 --> 00:00:30.935]  17-year-old Shamsu undergoes a DNA test to prove he's a victim of a failed drug trial by the pharmaceutical company Pfizer that happened 15 years ago in Kano State, Nigeria.
[00:00:30.935 --> 00:00:39.022]  11 children were killed and several more injured when Pfizer tested out a drug called Trovan on 200 children.
[00:00:39.022 --> 00:00:43.025]  The drug was supposed to treat a deadly regional outbreak of meningitis.
[00:00:43.646 --> 00:00:49.530]  Pfizer agreed to pay $75 million in compensation in 2009.
[00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.412]  Have you taken the vaccine, sir?
[00:00:52.412 --> 00:00:55.194]  No, I haven't taken it yet.
[00:00:55.194 --> 00:00:59.357]  We are having an ethical committee dealing with the question of who is getting it.
[00:00:59.357 --> 00:01:07.783]  So they're going to plan on getting FDA approval for the COVID vaccine next week so they can try to push all these mandates on everybody because they're going to tell you how safe and effective it is.
[00:01:07.783 --> 00:01:08.704]  Well, guess how they did it?
[00:01:09.304 --> 00:01:20.427]  They got a woman named Janet Woodcock, who is the chief for the Center of Drug Evaluation Research, and they put her as the acting head of the FDA to give her the approval status.
[00:01:20.427 --> 00:01:34.911]  And this woman is personally responsible for approving both Oxycontin, which is causing a friggin epidemic, and Fentanyl, the two most dangerous drugs on the market today, that got approved by this woman, Janet Woodcock,
[00:01:35.171 --> 00:01:39.352]  This would tip businesses and colleges to consider mandating the vaccine once it gets full approval.
[00:01:39.352 --> 00:01:40.313]  Would you urge them to do that?
[00:01:51.656 --> 00:02:05.620]  The FDA has now granted full approval of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, making it the first COVID vaccine to transition from emergency authorization status to full FDA approval.
[00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.201]  This is a game-changing moment.
[00:02:07.201 --> 00:02:11.382]  We've been waiting for this for a long time, to have the full approval of vaccine.
[00:02:11.382 --> 00:02:12.602]  We now have it.
[00:02:12.602 --> 00:02:18.304]  This helps us move forward, and we're moving forward with our schools with this new vaccine mandate.
[00:02:18.664 --> 00:02:31.368]  After a strict process, the FDA has reaffirmed its findings that the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective, and the FDA has given its full and final approval.
[00:02:31.368 --> 00:02:34.869]  So let me say this loudly and clearly.
[00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:46.833]  If you're one of the millions of Americans who said that they will not get the shot until it has full and final approval of the FDA, it has now happened.
[00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.251]  The moment you've been waiting for is here.
[00:02:50.251 --> 00:02:54.972]  It's time for you to go get your vaccination and get it today.
[00:02:54.972 --> 00:03:05.916]  Today, I'm calling on more country, more companies, I should say, in the private sector to step up with vaccine requirements that will reach millions more people.
[00:03:05.916 --> 00:03:16.459]  If you're a business leader, a nonprofit leader, a state or local leader who has been waiting for full FDA approval to require vaccinations, I'm calling you now to do that.
[00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:17.039]  Require it.
[00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:19.580]  Do what I did last month.
[00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:24.223]  Require your employees to get vaccinated or face strict requirements.
[00:03:24.223 --> 00:03:26.665]  This is right out of the federal government's own numbers.
[00:03:26.665 --> 00:03:28.266]  Daily report trends.
[00:03:28.266 --> 00:03:29.847]  Romania.
[00:03:29.847 --> 00:03:31.628]  How do we explain this situation in Romania?
[00:03:31.628 --> 00:03:34.610]  25% of the population vaccinated.
[00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.793]  Cases and deaths plummeting to basically zero.
[00:03:37.793 --> 00:03:38.993]  Or the lowest in the world.
[00:03:38.993 --> 00:03:40.615]  Same thing in Australia.
[00:03:40.615 --> 00:03:43.457]  They got 27% taking the vaccine.
[00:03:43.457 --> 00:03:45.178]  No one is in the hospital now that
[00:03:46.124 --> 00:03:47.384]  It's unvaccinated.
[00:03:47.384 --> 00:03:53.767]  Now, what's happening in the most vaccinated state in the United States?
[00:03:53.767 --> 00:03:55.587]  Current hospitalizations, Hawaii.
[00:03:55.587 --> 00:04:02.490]  You can see the mask mandate and the inoculations all starting right here.
[00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:06.331]  And what happens right when they start the shots?
[00:04:06.331 --> 00:04:07.471]  Hospitalization spike.
[00:04:07.471 --> 00:04:11.433]  But it takes a while for the mutations to grow and to get out into the population.
[00:04:11.433 --> 00:04:14.774]  And then suddenly, look at that spike.
[00:04:27.435 --> 00:04:40.478]  We're talking millions in France, millions in Australia, overrunning the police, overrunning the shopping malls, the grocery stores, saying no to the COVID checkpoints, saying they know it's the Great Reset, they're chanting
[00:04:42.216 --> 00:04:47.498]  The first time I heard the speech, the first time I read the writings of Teddy Roosevelt, I was in 6th grade.
[00:05:09.545 --> 00:05:14.728]  We had this history teacher that had us write a paper on the man in the arena.
[00:05:14.728 --> 00:05:18.571]  And I just remember thinking about that and saying, I want to be the man in the arena.
[00:05:18.571 --> 00:05:21.873]  But when it comes to media, Infowars has been the tip of that spear.
[00:05:21.873 --> 00:05:30.118]  But Mike Lindell has come along and done just as good a job as we've done, maybe even better when it comes to election fraud and other issues.
[00:05:30.118 --> 00:05:33.521]  And that's why if you go to MyPillow.com and use promo code ALEX,
[00:05:34.321 --> 00:05:37.843]  You get up to 66% off on all the amazing products.
[00:05:37.843 --> 00:05:41.105]  He's got so many, not just pillows, not just towels, not just sheets.
[00:05:41.105 --> 00:05:45.928]  And then you fund InfoWars and Mike Lindell and the fight for free speech against the globalists.
[00:05:45.928 --> 00:05:50.270]  There's not a better place to spend your money than MyPillow.com with promo code Alex.
[00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:56.414]  And if you do it, it funds the InfoWars, it funds the election investigation, and it stands up against these globalist bullies.
[00:05:56.414 --> 00:05:59.035]  MyPillow.com, promo code Alex.
[00:05:59.035 --> 00:05:59.856]  Take action now.
[00:06:19.027 --> 00:06:20.148]  InfoWars.
[00:06:20.148 --> 00:06:21.349]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:06:21.349 --> 00:06:21.670]  Today.
[00:06:31.602 --> 00:06:37.872]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:42.418 --> 00:06:56.124]  Despite all the censorship and all the attacks, thanks to our incredible listeners across the planet, every race, color, and creed who bleed red blood and love liberty, we are still number one in transmitting the truth on a planetary scale.
[00:06:56.124 --> 00:06:58.185]  It's Tuesday, August 24th.
[00:06:58.185 --> 00:06:58.906]  The year is 2021.
[00:06:58.906 --> 00:07:08.210]  We are now inside the vaunted New World Order.
[00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:12.072]  And it's just going to get a lot crazier from here on out.
[00:07:13.959 --> 00:07:18.482]  Okay, you're going to see the best of people, we're going to see the worst of people now.
[00:07:18.482 --> 00:07:27.489]  There is incredibly beautiful opposition to the clear tyranny of 1984 proportions that is taking place across the world.
[00:07:27.489 --> 00:07:29.691]  And you're going to find out who's for slavery and who isn't.
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.782]  Now, I don't lionize Bill Maher.
[00:07:32.782 --> 00:07:34.663]  I've been a big enemy of Bill Maher.
[00:07:34.663 --> 00:07:36.305]  We had listeners take over.
[00:07:36.305 --> 00:07:37.786]  I mean, I didn't do it.
[00:07:37.786 --> 00:07:40.708]  I didn't order him to do it, but he blamed me, so I took the blame.
[00:07:40.708 --> 00:07:42.710]  I mean, I said, yeah, I support it.
[00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:47.454]  Take over his live studio audience a couple times, exposing Building 7 and the fact that it was blown up.
[00:07:49.363 --> 00:07:58.193]  But when he gets things right and comes out and says, don't block Ivor Mechting, don't censor the internet, don't censor Alex Jones, Alex Jones gets to speak.
[00:07:58.193 --> 00:08:03.999]  When he comes out and says, Google lied to us about the Wuhan lab, it shouldn't be censoring.
[00:08:03.999 --> 00:08:05.340]  When he comes out and says, look,
[00:08:06.181 --> 00:08:07.982]  I took the vaccine.
[00:08:07.982 --> 00:08:09.383]  It's not a vaccine.
[00:08:09.383 --> 00:08:12.104]  And then I got COVID really bad after I took it.
[00:08:12.104 --> 00:08:13.564]  He knows he got sick from it.
[00:08:13.564 --> 00:08:16.406]  And quite frankly, Mar looks 10 years older since he took it.
[00:08:16.406 --> 00:08:17.086]  I'm not putting him down.
[00:08:17.086 --> 00:08:17.586]  It's just true.
[00:08:17.586 --> 00:08:19.687]  And I think he's pissed off about it.
[00:08:19.687 --> 00:08:21.688]  Just like all these other people that have taken it.
[00:08:21.688 --> 00:08:26.570]  How many prominent people have taken it because they wanted to get the economy back going?
[00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:27.831]  They believe the carrot
[00:08:28.934 --> 00:08:29.395]  I don't know.
[00:08:47.984 --> 00:08:48.304]  Thank you.
[00:09:10.063 --> 00:09:10.844]  He has great analogies.
[00:09:10.844 --> 00:09:12.125]  I mean, I'd love to get him on our side.
[00:09:12.125 --> 00:09:13.406]  He's super smart.
[00:09:13.406 --> 00:09:16.569]  He said, that'd be like buying a safe for your house.
[00:09:16.569 --> 00:09:20.652]  And they go, oh, we're going to drop by sometimes and just make sure there's not child porn in it.
[00:09:20.652 --> 00:09:22.934]  What the hell does that mean?
[00:09:22.934 --> 00:09:23.554]  What does that mean?
[00:09:23.554 --> 00:09:28.078]  You got your passport, you got guns in there, you got insurance policies and stuff.
[00:09:28.078 --> 00:09:29.880]  Oh, well, we need to look.
[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:33.323]  We need to see what's in there.
[00:09:33.323 --> 00:09:34.724]  This is the creed of slaves.
[00:09:34.724 --> 00:09:38.027]  I mean, another analogy would be, all houses must be made out of glass.
[00:09:39.619 --> 00:09:45.000]  And you must keep your lights on all night long in case you try something in the dark.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.261]  I mean, do not look at the sun.
[00:09:48.261 --> 00:09:49.501]  Do not leave your house.
[00:09:49.501 --> 00:09:51.221]  Do not talk to your neighbors.
[00:09:51.221 --> 00:09:53.542]  Do not look them in the eye.
[00:09:53.542 --> 00:09:58.943]  That's being said in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Spain.
[00:09:58.943 --> 00:10:05.764]  You're like, well, that sounds like Jim Jones to the order of a hundred.
[00:10:05.764 --> 00:10:09.325]  And yeah, that's real cult programming.
[00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:18.209]  Because the globalists want you to do something that doesn't make sense and destroys you.
[00:10:18.209 --> 00:10:21.333]  So we have got this insane things going on.
[00:10:21.333 --> 00:10:30.624]  Brett Favre, famous NFL quarterback, they snuck it in on CNN when he was talking about
[00:10:32.062 --> 00:10:34.083]  Concussions that, hey, do you support the vaccines?
[00:10:34.083 --> 00:10:36.644]  And basically said no.
[00:10:36.644 --> 00:10:38.084]  So now they're all freaking out about that.
[00:10:38.084 --> 00:10:40.285]  I mean, people do their own research.
[00:10:40.285 --> 00:10:45.087]  They're not stupid, especially at that level of competition.
[00:10:45.087 --> 00:10:48.088]  And the studies are out.
[00:10:48.088 --> 00:10:53.970]  The more educated you are, the higher your income, the more you don't want these shots.
[00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:57.611]  Because you go read that they've got liability protection.
[00:10:58.882 --> 00:11:10.533]  That all the top scientists are warning it's going to hurt you, that they did secret animal trials trying to get this approved before and it killed most of the animals, and now there's all this carnage, and they still just want to stampede us into this.
[00:11:10.533 --> 00:11:11.994]  It's insane.
[00:11:11.994 --> 00:11:14.517]  So, now they've got... Let's just play it back to back.
[00:11:14.517 --> 00:11:16.939]  Here's Bill Maher, then we'll play Brett Favre.
[00:11:17.998 --> 00:11:22.820]  You know, because, like, now they want us to do all these boosters we were talking about with Andrew.
[00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:24.301]  I mean, I don't want a booster.
[00:11:24.301 --> 00:11:26.062]  Look, I never wanted the vaccine.
[00:11:26.062 --> 00:11:28.503]  I took one for the team.
[00:11:28.503 --> 00:11:32.125]  And that's... And, by the way, you know who doesn't get a lot of vaccines?
[00:11:32.125 --> 00:11:32.685]  Millennials.
[00:11:32.685 --> 00:11:33.886]  I know a lot of millennials.
[00:11:33.886 --> 00:11:35.466]  Especially the 20, 20-year-olds.
[00:11:35.466 --> 00:11:36.087]  They don't want it.
[00:11:36.087 --> 00:11:36.647]  They don't want it.
[00:11:36.647 --> 00:11:37.507]  They don't think they need it.
[00:11:37.507 --> 00:11:38.588]  They're probably right.
[00:11:38.588 --> 00:11:40.649]  But I tell them, I didn't want it either.
[00:11:40.649 --> 00:11:43.210]  I took one for the team.
[00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:46.752]  But a boost... But every eight months you're going to put this shit in me?
[00:11:47.819 --> 00:11:48.860]  I don't know about that.
[00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:50.201]  Maybe I don't need one.
[00:11:50.201 --> 00:11:52.883]  I don't want a one-size-fits-all.
[00:11:52.883 --> 00:11:54.785]  My body may be different than your body.
[00:11:55.689 --> 00:11:57.030]  Yeah, I lost you, man.
[00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:58.752]  That's crazy.
[00:11:58.752 --> 00:12:00.213]  My body isn't different.
[00:12:00.213 --> 00:12:01.934]  Everybody's body isn't somewhat different.
[00:12:01.934 --> 00:12:04.737]  I just read the statistics about who dies from this.
[00:12:04.737 --> 00:12:06.699]  You're trying to be cute and you're rolling the dice.
[00:12:06.699 --> 00:12:07.779]  I'm not trying to be cute.
[00:12:07.779 --> 00:12:08.680]  I know I'm in your house.
[00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:10.462]  I don't want to step over the line here.
[00:12:10.462 --> 00:12:14.786]  But genuinely, genuinely, people's lives are on the line.
[00:12:14.786 --> 00:12:20.470]  And just as significantly, our very way of life is on the line here.
[00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:23.193]  It's very important that people get vaccinated.
[00:12:23.593 --> 00:12:25.155]  He's going to yell at him in a minute.
[00:12:25.155 --> 00:12:29.238]  But look at this Democrat slimeball know-it-all who says, oh, are you crazy?
[00:12:29.238 --> 00:12:30.019]  Are you serious?
[00:12:30.019 --> 00:12:32.001]  That's his intellectual argument.
[00:12:32.001 --> 00:12:36.405]  Hey, your buddy Fauci cooked it up at the lab with Bill Gates and the Chai Coms.
[00:12:36.405 --> 00:12:39.147]  They released it.
[00:12:39.147 --> 00:12:40.809]  They then suppressed treatments for it.
[00:12:40.809 --> 00:12:46.795]  You're signed on to a pack of murderers that own the patents on all these poison injections they're bringing out right now.
[00:12:46.795 --> 00:12:49.157]  Let's not forget who's behind this whole thing.
[00:12:50.285 --> 00:12:58.877]  Let's not forget that these shots lower your immunity, where you're going to have them for the rest of your life all the time, and this is a trap, and Bill Maher gets that!
[00:12:58.877 --> 00:13:03.504]  Why would people as a general society, even in the establishment, want to create a hell?
[00:13:03.504 --> 00:13:04.626]  That destroys everybody!
[00:13:06.288 --> 00:13:19.873]  But these guys want to follow the corporate directives of psychotic big pharma when Pfizer has more convictions and more giant settlements for knowingly killing people in secret trials around the world in the third world that any other company can buy.
[00:13:19.873 --> 00:13:24.094]  They're worse than Bayer that knowingly gave millions HIV and hepatitis.
[00:13:24.094 --> 00:13:25.735]  You think this is a freaking joke?
[00:13:25.735 --> 00:13:32.297]  You little smart-mouthed punk, reading your corporate lines, trying to gaslight us, you little bastard!
[00:13:32.297 --> 00:13:32.837]  Finish the clip.
[00:13:34.797 --> 00:13:37.638]  I said I took one for the genes.
[00:13:37.638 --> 00:13:38.039]  Right.
[00:13:38.039 --> 00:13:39.199]  I'm saying get vaccinated.
[00:13:39.199 --> 00:13:39.799]  Don't stop it here.
[00:14:01.701 --> 00:14:03.422]  Well, the guy said so on and so forth.
[00:14:03.422 --> 00:14:04.782]  Wow, that's really intellectual.
[00:14:04.782 --> 00:14:07.944]  Notice he also said our way of life is threatened.
[00:14:07.944 --> 00:14:09.825]  Oh, you're holding us hostage.
[00:14:09.825 --> 00:14:18.009]  For Australia, the government admits, oh, we're following the UN recommendations to keep the lockdowns going until you all accept the shots.
[00:14:18.993 --> 00:14:27.637]  So you're holding us hostage, and then saying, oh, those of you that don't take the shots, you're the reason two-year-olds gotta wear a mask when it does nothing.
[00:14:27.637 --> 00:14:30.799]  You people are damn cult leaders, and we see through you.
[00:14:30.799 --> 00:14:32.800]  You need to be in frickin' prison!
[00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:42.684]  You people cooked it up, you released it, and you need to be held, and you need to be charged, and you need to be tried, and you need to have your necks broken!
[00:14:42.684 --> 00:14:45.686]  After you've been convicted legally in a court of law, go back to them.
[00:14:46.491 --> 00:14:49.613]  I make, could I have some medical autonomy?
[00:14:49.613 --> 00:14:59.238]  No, look, you absolutely, no one is mandating it for you in your particular position, although they might, but I do think that... Stop again, hit pause.
[00:14:59.238 --> 00:14:59.919]  We gotta go to break.
[00:14:59.919 --> 00:15:02.460]  I'm gonna come back and just play this whole thing.
[00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:03.401]  Listen to the double thing.
[00:15:03.401 --> 00:15:05.582]  No one's mandating it for you at this time.
[00:15:05.582 --> 00:15:06.523]  Maybe they will.
[00:15:06.523 --> 00:15:07.623]  It's all being pushed.
[00:15:07.623 --> 00:15:08.784]  It's all being bullied.
[00:15:08.784 --> 00:15:10.365]  It all violates the Nuremberg Code.
[00:15:11.718 --> 00:15:17.487]  And they've got these corporate shills just rattling off BS at us when everything they told us is a lie.
[00:15:17.487 --> 00:15:19.290]  In fact, find it during the break if you can.
[00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:21.293]  I played like three times last week.
[00:15:21.293 --> 00:15:25.159]  THE Surgeon General, in his little admiral outfit.
[00:15:26.749 --> 00:15:30.071]  You know, it was weird whenever the head of Scientology did it.
[00:15:30.071 --> 00:15:31.953]  It's just as weird when this guy does it.
[00:15:31.953 --> 00:15:37.017]  He's up there in this admiral outfit and he says, oh, natural immunity doesn't work.
[00:15:37.017 --> 00:15:38.077]  It's no good.
[00:15:38.077 --> 00:15:39.538]  It doesn't exist.
[00:15:39.538 --> 00:15:43.341]  That's a total lie when it's 20, 30, 40 times better than this crap.
[00:15:43.341 --> 00:15:44.502]  Even if it was good, it's not.
[00:15:44.502 --> 00:15:48.005]  They're just lying to you like fire is not hot.
[00:15:48.005 --> 00:15:49.165]  Fish do not live in the water.
[00:15:50.026 --> 00:15:52.468]  George Washington was not the President of the United States.
[00:15:52.468 --> 00:15:57.191]  I mean, just lie after lie after lie, beady-eyed scum lying to us!
[00:15:59.284 --> 00:16:07.691]  If you're concerned about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of off-grid electricity, this will be the most important message you'll hear this year.
[00:16:07.691 --> 00:16:08.712]  Here's why.
[00:16:08.712 --> 00:16:12.635]  We now have a small number of solar generators back in stock.
[00:16:12.635 --> 00:16:17.760]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving backup power when you need it most.
[00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:26.187]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly, emit no dangerous fumes, and produce an endless supply of free electricity from the sun.
[00:16:26.728 --> 00:16:34.688]  Whether it's wildfires, dangerous weather, power grid issues, or just getting off the grid, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[00:16:35.387 --> 00:16:41.469]  Even better, all this week, radio listeners get over $700 in free off-the-grid bonuses too!
[00:16:41.469 --> 00:16:45.311]  Go to MySolarBackup.com to learn more and check availability.
[00:16:45.311 --> 00:16:47.312]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[00:16:47.312 --> 00:16:55.715]  Look for the free report, Crisis Cooling, how to make absolutely sure your meat, milk, and medicines stay safe and cool in any power outage.
[00:16:55.715 --> 00:16:58.076]  Yours free at MySolarBackup.com.
[00:16:58.576 --> 00:16:59.536]  Hey everybody!
[00:16:59.536 --> 00:17:05.038]  If you've ever thought about heirloom beans as a storable survival food, I've got great news.
[00:17:05.038 --> 00:17:07.479]  In fact, I'll bet it's the best news you've heard in a while.
[00:17:07.479 --> 00:17:08.319]  Here's the thing.
[00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:12.620]  We've just received a fresh batch of gourmet heirloom beans.
[00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:13.980]  Survival soup beans.
[00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:22.163]  These beans are gorgeous, highly nutritious, and above all, with no hesitation whatsoever, the best tasting beans in the entire world.
[00:17:22.163 --> 00:17:22.703]  The best part?
[00:17:23.263 --> 00:17:32.546]  We've dropped the price by 33% this week for listeners who know higher food prices are coming and want an inflation hedge you can actually eat if you want to.
[00:17:32.546 --> 00:17:33.587]  Gets even better!
[00:17:33.587 --> 00:17:44.351]  With your permission, and with a high regard for your health and well-being, I also want to send you two pounds of what we think is the single most underrated superfood in the world.
[00:17:44.351 --> 00:17:44.751]  Period.
[00:17:45.151 --> 00:17:57.190]  Go to soupbeansurvival.com, that's soupbeansurvival.com and discover the real reason we're giving this unusual superfood away at soupbeansurvival.com, that's soupbeansurvival.com.
[00:18:00.421 --> 00:18:03.984]  So when I first started taking Survival Shield, basically I was 275 pounds.
[00:18:03.984 --> 00:18:05.466]  I was overweight.
[00:18:05.466 --> 00:18:07.748]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe.
[00:18:07.748 --> 00:18:09.669]  I was barely holding on to a job.
[00:18:09.669 --> 00:18:12.171]  And I heard Dr. Grove on your show and I listened to it.
[00:18:12.171 --> 00:18:14.934]  So the first one I got was the original Survival Shield, the X1.
[00:18:14.934 --> 00:18:15.835]  And it worked for
[00:18:16.155 --> 00:18:16.675]  Pretty good.
[00:18:16.675 --> 00:18:29.424]  And then, shortly thereafter, you came out with XT, you know, with a deep root source, you know, and I got really excited about that, so I took it, and man, in two weeks, I went from brain fog to, like, literally, like, my brain was enlightened, you know?
[00:18:29.424 --> 00:18:30.485]  I could think again.
[00:18:30.485 --> 00:18:32.326]  I could connect with people again.
[00:18:32.326 --> 00:18:38.710]  And over the course of the next couple of years, I got my health back, and I religiously take basically all of your supplements.
[00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:41.092]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[00:18:41.092 --> 00:18:42.973]  The one I like recently is Knockout.
[00:18:42.973 --> 00:18:45.214]  It literally, like, if you want to sleep, just take it.
[00:18:45.214 --> 00:18:45.775]  It's amazing.
[00:18:46.436 --> 00:18:47.297]  Beautifully said, brother.
[00:18:47.297 --> 00:18:49.040]  I thank you so much for your call, and Godspeed.
[00:19:03.439 --> 00:19:04.679]  Jacob in Ohio.
[00:19:04.679 --> 00:19:05.060]  Welcome.
[00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:05.520]  Go ahead.
[00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:06.820]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:07.380]  Good, brother.
[00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:08.461]  Great last caller.
[00:19:08.461 --> 00:19:11.522]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement.
[00:19:11.522 --> 00:19:17.243]  It's basically the only way I get sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, demoralization, and absurdity.
[00:19:17.243 --> 00:19:18.804]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone.
[00:19:19.344 --> 00:19:21.025]  All right, Eric in New Hampshire.
[00:19:21.025 --> 00:19:21.985]  Eric, thanks for calling.
[00:19:21.985 --> 00:19:22.325]  Go ahead.
[00:19:22.325 --> 00:19:23.865]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[00:19:23.865 --> 00:19:26.906]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for one of the products.
[00:19:26.906 --> 00:19:28.567]  The X Team does wonders.
[00:19:28.567 --> 00:19:29.707]  I recommend it to everybody.
[00:19:29.707 --> 00:19:30.908]  You're on the fence about it.
[00:19:30.908 --> 00:19:31.688]  Get off the fence.
[00:19:31.688 --> 00:19:32.568]  Get the product.
[00:19:32.568 --> 00:19:33.788]  Support the info war.
[00:19:33.788 --> 00:19:35.069]  Tyler in Maine.
[00:19:35.069 --> 00:19:35.729]  You're on the air.
[00:19:35.729 --> 00:19:36.269]  Thanks for holding.
[00:19:36.269 --> 00:19:36.849]  Go ahead.
[00:19:36.849 --> 00:19:38.330]  Hey Alex, it's great to be on with you.
[00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:38.910]  It's an honor.
[00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:39.911]  Honored to talk to you.
[00:19:39.911 --> 00:19:41.051]  Awesome.
[00:19:41.051 --> 00:19:44.674]  So, first thing I wanted to do is to say I love the products.
[00:19:44.674 --> 00:19:46.755]  Alpha Power, even at 29.
[00:19:46.755 --> 00:19:49.237]  If you ask my better half, she loves it.
[00:19:49.237 --> 00:19:50.598]  And it helps in the bedroom.
[00:19:50.598 --> 00:19:53.240]  So, just number one for a few of the... Oh, it definitely works.
[00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:54.881]  It's not a joke.
[00:19:54.881 --> 00:20:02.726]  Absolutely.
[00:20:02.726 --> 00:20:05.348]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:21.431 --> 00:20:27.289]  So they're lying to you in the most bald-faced, insane lies they can, everywhere.
[00:20:27.289 --> 00:20:27.950]  In every way.
[00:20:29.497 --> 00:20:31.999]  But the people of the world are waking up and resisting.
[00:20:31.999 --> 00:20:33.701]  Next segment, I'll cover it.
[00:20:33.701 --> 00:20:37.565]  All over the planet, in the UK, they're taking over TV stations.
[00:20:37.565 --> 00:20:44.111]  In France, millions are marching, taking over whole cities, taking over shopping malls, just absolutely dominating.
[00:20:44.111 --> 00:20:48.275]  In Australia, they're just breaking free and refusing to submit.
[00:20:48.275 --> 00:20:53.140]  And now, the Prime Minister is saying, OK, now we have to end the lockdowns because of the rebellion.
[00:20:54.076 --> 00:20:56.797]  Now as soon as people stop rebelling, they'll bring the lockdowns right back.
[00:20:56.797 --> 00:21:01.499]  But people have to understand that this is the Great Reset.
[00:21:01.499 --> 00:21:03.080]  This is a takeover plan.
[00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:03.600]  Here's another one.
[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:09.543]  Australia truck drivers vow to block every major highway in radical anti-lockdown strike.
[00:21:09.543 --> 00:21:11.644]  Zero hedge.
[00:21:11.644 --> 00:21:13.285]  We'll be covering that coming up next segment.
[00:21:14.022 --> 00:21:17.727]  Because they're coming for our children, and Australia is the model.
[00:21:17.727 --> 00:21:26.380]  As Tucker Carlson did an excellent job last night covering, and as we've been doing an excellent job covering here, obviously very intensely in the last few months.
[00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:30.065]  But right now, let's go back to this Bill Maher, the Democratic Party operative.
[00:21:30.666 --> 00:21:36.349]  He's got on there, and Bill Maher just started saying, do I get any medical autonomy?
[00:21:36.349 --> 00:21:37.069]  Do I have any?
[00:21:37.069 --> 00:21:39.410]  And the guy's like, oh yeah, you have it, maybe.
[00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:41.031]  Well, we can take it away.
[00:21:41.031 --> 00:21:44.153]  I mean, this is just so, on a scale of 1 to 100, it's 110.
[00:21:44.153 --> 00:21:48.115]  I mean, it's just cartoon level, 1984 science fiction dystopia.
[00:21:54.221 --> 00:21:56.802]  And it doesn't even work.
[00:21:56.802 --> 00:22:04.804]  I mean, if it worked, we would go, okay, they're using a good drug to get a global database to control us to get rid of our rights, and we'll be set up later under their control.
[00:22:04.804 --> 00:22:13.966]  That's like in Childhood's End that was written by Arthur C. Clarke that launched his whole career as a globalist, you know, uses a template of their actual plan.
[00:22:13.966 --> 00:22:18.807]  The aliens show up and won't really show themselves, but they give us life extension where we stop dying.
[00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:27.843]  And it takes a generation or two until we find out, well, it's because they're actually going to take our bodies and take our, steal our souls.
[00:22:27.843 --> 00:22:31.244]  Oh, and the aliens don't look too friendly either.
[00:22:31.244 --> 00:22:34.626]  So there it worked a hundred percent.
[00:22:34.626 --> 00:22:39.048]  Like they come and they give you something that works, but they get full control doing it.
[00:22:39.048 --> 00:22:44.310]  This isn't even like having real peanut butter or cheese on the mousetrap.
[00:22:45.379 --> 00:22:52.603]  It's just a mouse trap that you see killing mice and there's not even a piece of food on the trap.
[00:22:52.603 --> 00:22:55.584]  And you still just run and jump into it.
[00:22:55.584 --> 00:22:58.125]  It's the murder of common sense.
[00:22:58.125 --> 00:23:02.227]  Again, we're going to scan everything on your phone remotely.
[00:23:02.227 --> 00:23:05.629]  And then they put billboards up and we're saying Apple equals privacy.
[00:23:05.629 --> 00:23:07.230]  You're like, that's gaslighting.
[00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:12.953]  It's behavioral psychologists running corporations that are in a revolution against us.
[00:23:13.968 --> 00:23:22.714]  That's why there's sudden satanism on TV and pedophilia on TV and world government on TV and all these lies because they're getting ready for a total financial collapse.
[00:23:22.714 --> 00:23:31.161]  And you know, we really should just talk about that because this demoralization, these poison shots, that's just getting us ready for the collapse.
[00:23:31.161 --> 00:23:33.602]  And you know, you tune in here to get tomorrow's news today.
[00:23:36.517 --> 00:23:45.079]  Well, starting next hour, I'm going to get more into what's coming next in this total collapse, because there's still time to mitigate how bad it's going to be, but not much.
[00:23:45.079 --> 00:23:49.580]  And I just want everybody to know who the authors of their enslavement and destruction is.
[00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:51.181]  So we'll be laying that out as well.
[00:23:51.181 --> 00:23:53.401]  We have some big special guests I'll tell you about in the next segment.
[00:23:53.401 --> 00:23:55.422]  But first, let's go back to Bill Maher.
[00:23:56.232 --> 00:23:58.515]  So is my body different?
[00:23:58.515 --> 00:24:01.899]  Can I have some medical autonomy?
[00:24:01.899 --> 00:24:15.035]  No, look, you absolutely, no one is mandating it for you in your particular position, although they might, but I do think that it's very dangerous to enter into a conversation here about personal responsibility.
[00:24:15.615 --> 00:24:19.276]  When the truth of the matter is that this is a matter of collective responsibility.
[00:24:19.276 --> 00:24:25.238]  If large groups of people do not get vaccinated, they go to the hospital, and our hospitals get overrun.
[00:24:25.238 --> 00:24:29.479]  That's why I use... And then you can't get a mammogram, you can't get a biopsy, and so many other things.
[00:24:29.479 --> 00:24:31.720]  Literally, society as we know it can't function.
[00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:34.241]  That's... So, this is important.
[00:24:34.241 --> 00:24:36.741]  That people are urged to get vaccinated.
[00:24:36.741 --> 00:24:37.842]  It's important that they do get vaccinated.
[00:24:37.842 --> 00:24:38.662]  That's why I use...
[00:24:44.517 --> 00:24:47.339]  That's why I said the team.
[00:24:47.339 --> 00:24:48.180]  Well, we're proud to have you.
[00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:53.103]  Because I did it for the team.
[00:24:53.103 --> 00:24:57.266]  Max, what's that idiot's name?
[00:24:57.266 --> 00:24:58.627]  Rose.
[00:24:58.627 --> 00:25:00.088]  Where do they dig these people up?
[00:25:00.088 --> 00:25:02.410]  So all that's doublespeak, all that's tyranny.
[00:25:02.410 --> 00:25:05.392]  Former congressman from New York, of course.
[00:25:05.392 --> 00:25:06.753]  Okay, so let's go ahead.
[00:25:08.869 --> 00:25:18.537]  And of course, Max Rose isn't going to take care of you when your kid gets cancer from the shot, or when you cut your uterus out because of it, which is happening, or when you get blood clots and have a stroke.
[00:25:18.537 --> 00:25:21.139]  He won't pay for your nursing home.
[00:25:21.139 --> 00:25:24.762]  You can bet your bottom dollar, Max Rose hasn't taken the shots.
[00:25:24.762 --> 00:25:28.465]  There's also this thing I see on Twitter and Instagram without even looking, just everywhere.
[00:25:28.465 --> 00:25:31.147]  I bet Alex Jones secretly took the shot.
[00:25:31.147 --> 00:25:32.629]  He just doesn't want you to have it.
[00:25:32.629 --> 00:25:34.690]  What the hell does that mean?
[00:25:34.690 --> 00:25:35.531]  You people are crazy.
[00:25:36.809 --> 00:25:38.050]  I'm talking about the leftists, man.
[00:25:38.050 --> 00:25:40.633]  They are just so authoritarian.
[00:25:40.633 --> 00:25:46.938]  Here's Brett Favre getting asked about the so-called vaccines, the gene therapies that don't work other than making you sick.
[00:25:46.938 --> 00:25:47.419]  I'm singing in.
[00:25:48.357 --> 00:25:52.398]  Another health issue that is facing football and well, everyone right now is COVID.
[00:25:52.398 --> 00:25:58.079]  The Falcons today became the first NFL team to say that they are 100% vaccinated.
[00:25:58.079 --> 00:26:01.000]  The NFL has a higher vaccination rate than the general population.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:06.461]  They've been doing pretty well, but there are still some high-profile holdouts like Vikings, QB, Kirk Cousins.
[00:26:06.461 --> 00:26:14.622]  Why do you think there is still a struggle among some athletes, especially when people look to them as role models when it comes to the COVID vaccine?
[00:26:17.964 --> 00:26:19.364]  A great deal of uncertainty.
[00:26:19.364 --> 00:26:23.125]  You hear one thing one day and you hear something that's totally different the next.
[00:26:23.125 --> 00:26:26.446]  So, we're sort of the human trials, if you will.
[00:26:26.446 --> 00:26:29.847]  And, you know, I think some people are frightened by that.
[00:26:29.847 --> 00:26:35.469]  And the conflicting info that we're all getting.
[00:26:35.469 --> 00:26:44.631]  But there isn't really conflicting info that the vaccine is safe, effective, and needed, and is a public health matter.
[00:26:44.631 --> 00:26:45.692]  I mean, would you...
[00:26:47.998 --> 00:26:49.159]  Back it up 10 seconds.
[00:26:49.159 --> 00:26:52.522]  Safe, effective, and needed.
[00:26:52.522 --> 00:26:52.902]  Safe.
[00:26:52.902 --> 00:26:56.144]  It has more deaths than all other vaccines ever combined up front.
[00:26:56.144 --> 00:26:58.106]  It doesn't work, they admit.
[00:26:58.106 --> 00:26:59.267]  And it's not needed.
[00:26:59.267 --> 00:27:00.888]  And it's causing variants.
[00:27:00.888 --> 00:27:04.491]  But you just repeat that like parrots, don't you?
[00:27:04.491 --> 00:27:12.717]  To sit up there, nice pretty girl, with your yes men, on CNN, attacking your enemy, the American people.
[00:27:12.717 --> 00:27:14.719]  When China and India won't take any of these shots,
[00:27:15.828 --> 00:27:19.734]  The Australians are at 25%, and actually, they're not stupid.
[00:27:19.734 --> 00:27:25.183]  And they got a big problem, because so many people that took the shots are getting sick now with, quote, COVID from the shot.
[00:27:26.786 --> 00:27:31.970]  They're going to get their booster and then get even sicker and create more mutations?
[00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:37.755]  Well, there's national news everywhere, hundreds of news articles saying Alex Jones claims vaccines make you a mutant.
[00:27:37.755 --> 00:27:40.697]  Well, they do actually gene therapy change your genetics.
[00:27:40.697 --> 00:27:44.340]  They do mutate you like frankenfoods or whatever, you know, that Monsanto creates.
[00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:46.582]  But that's not what I meant by that in the full context.
[00:27:46.582 --> 00:27:48.744]  I was saying creates mutant strains.
[00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:51.541]  I'd rather not say one way or the other.
[00:28:20.447 --> 00:28:25.012]  I think it's not my place to say get the vaccine or don't get the vaccine.
[00:28:25.012 --> 00:28:28.456]  I think that's a matter of choice by all individuals.
[00:28:28.456 --> 00:28:30.899]  And, you know, that's why we live in America.
[00:28:30.899 --> 00:28:36.666]  But you yourself, I mean, you don't want to say, which I respect, but you don't trust the vaccines?
[00:28:37.817 --> 00:28:39.879]  Let's just hit pause.
[00:28:39.879 --> 00:28:43.463]  Hey, lady, when's the last time you visited your gynecologist?
[00:28:43.463 --> 00:28:45.184]  Did he stick his fingers in you?
[00:28:45.184 --> 00:28:47.126]  I mean, that's a rude thing to say, isn't it?
[00:28:47.126 --> 00:28:51.070]  Because it's your medical records, lady, and he's got his medical records.
[00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:53.312]  You remember your body, your choice?
[00:28:53.312 --> 00:28:56.455]  Understand, stay out of my body, you CNN witch!
[00:28:56.455 --> 00:28:56.856]  Stay with us.
[00:28:59.431 --> 00:29:00.251]  Hey, everybody.
[00:29:00.251 --> 00:29:03.473]  Confused about staying healthy in a crazy COVID culture?
[00:29:03.473 --> 00:29:04.234]  Me too.
[00:29:04.234 --> 00:29:11.358]  But listen, after all the research, all the conflicting studies, after all the squabbling, there's one thing almost everyone agrees on.
[00:29:11.358 --> 00:29:15.701]  It's that immune system health can literally be the difference between life and death.
[00:29:15.701 --> 00:29:17.582]  You probably already believe that.
[00:29:17.582 --> 00:29:18.602]  I certainly do.
[00:29:18.602 --> 00:29:19.543]  So here's the thing.
[00:29:19.543 --> 00:29:27.868]  I wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant-based substances actually have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support.
[00:29:28.428 --> 00:29:33.872]  Now, you'll have to sign a waiver, but you can check out what I've discovered at StrongerDefense.com.
[00:29:33.872 --> 00:29:35.213]  No cures or treatments there.
[00:29:35.213 --> 00:29:44.439]  Instead, little-known but shocking immune system research, and a breakthrough immune support product based on that research called Immune 10X.
[00:29:44.439 --> 00:29:45.339]  And the best part?

[00:29:56.887 --> 00:29:58.088]  That's StrongerDefense.com.
[00:29:58.310 --> 00:29:58.352]  Um...
[00:30:04.457 --> 00:30:05.618]  Granny Do-Right.
[00:30:05.618 --> 00:30:06.438]  Granny Do-Right.
[00:30:06.438 --> 00:30:07.518]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[00:30:07.518 --> 00:30:08.079]  Go ahead.
[00:30:08.079 --> 00:30:08.619]  Hey, Alex.
[00:30:08.619 --> 00:30:11.220]  First of all, let me say I love your products.
[00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:12.280]  I am a granny.
[00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:21.944]  And for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots, or age spots, as they're lovingly called.
[00:30:21.944 --> 00:30:27.927]  But since taking Eurex 2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous, actually.
[00:30:27.927 --> 00:30:28.947]  People think I'm 55 years old.
[00:30:31.228 --> 00:30:38.955]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's what I need to do, because I just thought it was a hopeless situation.
[00:30:38.955 --> 00:30:47.702]  But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately, but, you know, over a period of time, I started noticing, OK, you know, this is a ticket.
[00:30:47.702 --> 00:30:48.523]  This is working.
[00:30:48.523 --> 00:30:49.524]  This is wonderful.
[00:30:49.524 --> 00:30:54.068]  You know, I don't, I don't have to put on Dermablend anymore, you know?
[00:30:54.068 --> 00:30:58.712]  So anyway, it worked wonderfully, and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[00:31:00.814 --> 00:31:04.556]  Not all vitamin and mineral supplements are equal.
[00:31:04.556 --> 00:31:05.636]  Many of them are synthetic.
[00:31:05.636 --> 00:31:07.617]  Many of them have fillers and additives.
[00:31:07.617 --> 00:31:10.619]  Many of them just pass right through the body and are absorbed.
[00:31:10.619 --> 00:31:19.503]  Well, that's not the case with our incredibly popular, because it's so effective, product that has now been sold out for months, but it's finally back in stock.
[00:31:19.503 --> 00:31:21.985]  And that is Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:31:21.985 --> 00:31:24.626]  All the essential vitamins, all the essential minerals,
[00:31:24.986 --> 00:31:29.107]  A bunch of amino acids to help it upload better into your body and your cells.
[00:31:29.107 --> 00:31:30.067]  It's in powder form.
[00:31:30.067 --> 00:31:31.248]  It's great for children.
[00:31:31.248 --> 00:31:32.088]  It's great for adults.
[00:31:32.088 --> 00:31:36.969]  It's really important for folks that are older because they don't absorb as well through their guts.
[00:31:36.969 --> 00:31:39.210]  This liquid formula really, really does.
[00:31:39.210 --> 00:31:44.491]  You mix up a pitcher of it every couple days, put it in the refrigerator or keep it out in the kitchen.
[00:31:44.491 --> 00:31:46.912]  And just remember to drink it in the morning and in the evening.
[00:31:46.912 --> 00:31:47.932]  It tastes great.
[00:31:47.932 --> 00:31:49.252]  It makes your body healthy.
[00:31:49.252 --> 00:31:50.953]  It boosts your immune system.
[00:31:50.953 --> 00:31:52.733]  And it funds the Enfold.
[00:31:53.093 --> 00:31:54.114]  A true 360 win.
[00:31:54.114 --> 00:31:56.076]  So Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:31:56.076 --> 00:31:56.937]  Sold out for a month.
[00:31:56.937 --> 00:31:58.319]  It's back in stock for a limited time.
[00:31:58.319 --> 00:31:59.180]  33% off at HomeWearStore.com.
[00:32:00.911 --> 00:32:23.940]  Let's go back in time, say to the mid-1990s, and then imagine a science fiction movie set in the year 2020, where a world government's being established, where members of Congress and former presidents are censured by big tech, and where if you don't take an experimental injection that grows blood clots and prions all over your body, then you're not allowed to fly on an airplane.
[00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:26.922]  Think about that, because that's where we are.
[00:32:26.922 --> 00:32:33.687]  Imagine just 20, 30 years ago, hell, just 5 years ago, if somebody told you this would be happening.
[00:32:33.687 --> 00:32:35.748]  But it is happening now.
[00:32:35.748 --> 00:32:42.313]  And then they tell you, oh sorry, it's not a vaccine, it's a gene therapy, and it doesn't really work, so you've got to take it every few months.
[00:32:42.313 --> 00:32:44.855]  And the people that have submitted say, great!
[00:32:44.855 --> 00:32:47.957]  I want to take it all the time so I can go outside and not get sick from COVID.
[00:32:48.564 --> 00:32:51.185]  It's just not okay for kids to commit murder by coming to school without a mask.
[00:33:15.758 --> 00:33:18.039]  Fainted because of a mask.
[00:33:18.039 --> 00:33:20.201]  Like, wow, wow, congrats!
[00:33:20.201 --> 00:33:24.623]  We don't need no education.
[00:33:24.623 --> 00:33:29.546]  That unvaccinated children of a certain age, greater than two years old, should be wearing masks.
[00:33:29.546 --> 00:33:32.647]  We don't need no thought control.
[00:33:38.626 --> 00:33:48.532]  Our work doesn't stop there and we are going to continue to press to get 12 to 18 year olds vaccinated.
[00:33:48.532 --> 00:33:55.117]  Six and four year olds will likely be able to get vaccinated
[00:34:11.184 --> 00:34:12.505]  And you would recommend it?
[00:34:12.505 --> 00:34:13.066]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:34:13.066 --> 00:34:17.329]  If I had grandchildren, I would certainly recommend they get vaccinated.
[00:34:17.329 --> 00:34:20.411]  Specifically at the under 12 age group.
[00:34:29.281 --> 00:34:34.743]  The fact that we were not allowed to play on the playground, or have student council, or face each other at lunch.
[00:34:34.743 --> 00:34:39.865]  We also have to wear masks outside at P.E.
[00:34:39.865 --> 00:34:47.709]  I don't care if you're vaccinated, you little bitch!
[00:34:47.709 --> 00:34:52.531]  One teacher walks around with a clipboard full of referrals for any student whose mask isn't on promptly.
[00:35:13.623 --> 00:35:16.644]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, well, here we are.
[00:35:16.644 --> 00:35:18.625]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:35:18.625 --> 00:35:19.305]  That was an abrupt
[00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:21.600]  Ending there, wasn't it?
[00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:25.642]  I was like, not ready for that.
[00:35:25.642 --> 00:35:34.925]  But here we are, ladies and gentlemen, on this live August 24, 2021 transmission.
[00:35:34.925 --> 00:35:42.088]  And I guess I should probably tell you about some of the guests that are coming up here today.
[00:35:42.088 --> 00:35:45.389]  Dr. Sean M. Brooks, PhD, who
[00:35:46.994 --> 00:35:56.782]  Was speaking in his home state and gave a really good speech at his alma mater high school about the tyranny that was taking place.
[00:35:56.782 --> 00:36:00.565]  I think it's one of the best spoken people I've heard yet.
[00:36:00.565 --> 00:36:06.710]  And so he's going to be joining us in the third hour, a little bit into the fourth hour today.
[00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:13.576]  And then political prisoner Owen Schroer will be joining us.
[00:36:16.929 --> 00:36:34.540]  Coming up in the last 45 minutes of the fourth hour, he was only in jail for about four or five hours in the federal jail yesterday, and the judge put some restrictions on him not to talk to people involved in January 6th about the case.
[00:36:35.690 --> 00:36:40.154]  But at the same time, he is a talk show host and everything he did is on body cam.
[00:36:40.154 --> 00:36:43.377]  So what we did is on record.
[00:36:43.377 --> 00:36:48.482]  And so Owen will be here just in general, talking about the news and covering information.
[00:36:48.482 --> 00:37:01.133]  But the left got very upset, very, very, very upset to learn that Owen was not taken away to DC to be put in solitary confinement.
[00:37:02.188 --> 00:37:11.818]  Literally, his name trended yesterday, so did mine, in the top 10 of Twitter with people wishing for his death, people wishing for his execution.
[00:37:11.818 --> 00:37:18.746]  I don't even hate these weird people on Twitter and on other platforms.
[00:37:18.746 --> 00:37:21.168]  I just, I feel sorry for them because
[00:37:22.145 --> 00:37:26.067]  They are such authoritarians, but they're not even part of the power structure.
[00:37:26.067 --> 00:37:35.292]  They're just there like a mob, wanting to exact revenge on those of us that have just simply tried to save the country.
[00:37:35.292 --> 00:37:46.538]  And then they can see who they stole the election for, who they installed, destroying everyone's future, but they can't even seem to figure that out.
[00:37:46.538 --> 00:37:48.079]  Now there are so many powerful
[00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:54.823]  John Bowne reports that he's been doing lately, and I enjoy talking on the show.
[00:37:54.823 --> 00:38:03.207]  But at the same time, when we get really, really powerful reports and things in, I think it's really important to air those on the broadcast.
[00:38:03.207 --> 00:38:05.648]  And so we're going to play this report right now.
[00:38:05.648 --> 00:38:09.970]  The media celebrates World War Four plague.
[00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:16.483]  And then we also have the treasonous propaganda holdouts.
[00:38:16.483 --> 00:38:18.264]  These are all really important.
[00:38:18.264 --> 00:38:25.070]  Already played at the start of the show, but I think it's one of his best reports in a long time and really codifies the fraud of these people.
[00:38:25.070 --> 00:38:29.553]  And that's the COVID tyranny meets resistance worldwide.
[00:38:29.553 --> 00:38:35.237]  That is, that is such an incredibly important transmission.
[00:38:35.237 --> 00:38:36.538]  And I'm really proud of the listeners.
[00:38:36.538 --> 00:38:40.401]  We can go to the front page of Band.Video.
[00:38:40.401 --> 00:38:42.183]  The little short four minute clip.
[00:38:43.504 --> 00:38:55.847]  of Dr. Sean M. Brooks only had about 80,000 views yesterday, whenever we mentioned it, and I said, that needs to go viral.
[00:38:55.847 --> 00:38:57.347]  And you guys did an incredible job.
[00:38:57.347 --> 00:39:02.689]  It now has 1,051,700 plus views.
[00:39:02.689 --> 00:39:07.350]  And then if everybody you told to share it, if they just shared it, it would have 10 million.
[00:39:08.151 --> 00:39:11.513]  And then if they shared it, it'd have 100 million, and it'd be game over.
[00:39:11.513 --> 00:39:29.165]  Now, yes, the bills that we get, because Prison Planet is now unfolding, and people know that we have a lot of credibility, so our visitors are exploding, and so the bills that we get over at Band.Video,
[00:39:30.469 --> 00:39:33.271]  Which again is not the URL to share because they blocked that.
[00:39:33.271 --> 00:39:36.033]  You want to share the URL freeworldnews.tv.
[00:39:36.033 --> 00:39:37.394]  They're not censoring that yet.
[00:39:37.394 --> 00:39:41.677]  It's the exact same site, exact same index, freeworldnews.tv.
[00:39:41.677 --> 00:39:43.038]  The bills we get are just stratospheric.
[00:39:43.038 --> 00:39:49.162]  Millions of dollars a quarter just in bandwidth to run this operation and it's getting more insane.
[00:39:49.162 --> 00:39:52.124]  And we're always shopping around, always trying to get better deals.
[00:39:52.124 --> 00:39:54.065]  We buy a lot of bandwidth.
[00:39:54.065 --> 00:39:55.887]  But you have to understand that we're doing it all.
[00:39:55.887 --> 00:39:57.428]  The satellite uplinks, the encoders,
[00:39:58.709 --> 00:39:59.630]  Everything is us.
[00:39:59.630 --> 00:40:05.155]  And so when you see an iPhone, that is hundreds of millions of dollars of investment to make that.
[00:40:05.155 --> 00:40:06.716]  When you see a Droid, it's the same thing.
[00:40:06.716 --> 00:40:10.360]  When you see Google, that's trillions over the years.
[00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:12.962]  The last 25 years that have been spent to build that infrastructure.
[00:40:12.962 --> 00:40:13.923]  Trillions.
[00:40:13.923 --> 00:40:16.385]  Same thing with Apple.
[00:40:16.385 --> 00:40:19.308]  And same thing with those other companies like the big telecoms.
[00:40:19.308 --> 00:40:23.112]  So when I tell you we need tens of millions of dollars
[00:40:24.002 --> 00:40:32.722]  We're like David versus Goliath, but Goliath is a thousand feet tall and we're about six inches tall, but the truth is so powerful.
[00:40:33.971 --> 00:40:38.454]  That when we're able to fire the truth out, it still has a bigger effect than their trillions of dollars.
[00:40:38.454 --> 00:40:53.162]  But that's what this comes down to, is to do what we're doing and to be on hundreds of radio stations and TV stations and to be just dominating all over the place and to see them so mad on Facebook and YouTube and Twitter saying, how do we still hear of Alex Jones?
[00:40:53.162 --> 00:40:54.623]  Why is he still trending?
[00:40:54.623 --> 00:40:57.164]  Why is he still getting millions of viewers every day?
[00:40:57.164 --> 00:41:00.006]  And it's all because of you supporting us.
[00:41:00.006 --> 00:41:01.947]  It's all because of you taking action.
[00:41:03.635 --> 00:41:09.598]  It's all because of you and your perseverance and supporting us.
[00:41:09.598 --> 00:41:10.098]  So thank you.
[00:41:10.098 --> 00:41:13.700]  I'm going to go to break and come back with the report and get into all the huge news.
[00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:19.022]  But it really is you buying books and films and water filters and air filters.

[00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:56.001]  Alright, we'll be back.
[00:42:56.001 --> 00:42:56.401]  Stay with us.
[00:42:59.207 --> 00:43:03.311]  Humanity is the main stakeholder on this planet.
[00:43:03.311 --> 00:43:15.143]  But the big corporations for a hundred years have told us that humans are bad and evil, and a pestilence on the Earth, so that we begin to believe we're bad, and we'll turn off our life force, and let the eugenics-based globalists take control of the planet.
[00:43:15.143 --> 00:43:18.446]  If you look at Klaus Schwab, the head of the Daedalus Group's own Wikipedia page,
[00:43:18.926 --> 00:43:27.375]  He brags on there about how they're capturing democracy and taking over governments worldwide to set up a corporate dictatorship under the UN.
[00:43:27.375 --> 00:43:29.677]  They admit all of this.
[00:43:29.677 --> 00:43:30.958]  They plan the lockdowns.
[00:43:30.958 --> 00:43:32.640]  They release the viruses.
[00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:35.503]  They think you're stupid and their plan is to slowly
[00:43:35.503 --> 00:43:35.923]  We're good.
[00:43:59.398 --> 00:44:02.942]  So when I first started taking Survival Shield, basically I was 275 pounds.
[00:44:02.942 --> 00:44:04.403]  I was overweight.
[00:44:04.403 --> 00:44:06.706]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe.
[00:44:06.706 --> 00:44:08.648]  I was barely holding on to a job.
[00:44:08.648 --> 00:44:11.151]  And I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it.
[00:44:11.151 --> 00:44:13.873]  So the first one I got was the original Survival Shield, the X1.
[00:44:14.454 --> 00:44:28.403]  And it worked pretty good, and then shortly thereafter you came out with X2, you know, with a deep burden source, you know, and I got really excited about that, so I took it, and man, in two weeks, I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened, you know?
[00:44:28.403 --> 00:44:37.690]  I could think again, I could connect with people again, and over the course of the next couple of years, I got my health back, and I religiously take basically all of your supplements.
[00:44:37.690 --> 00:44:40.071]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[00:44:40.071 --> 00:44:41.152]  The one I like recently
[00:44:41.192 --> 00:44:42.514]  Beautifully said, brother.
[00:44:42.514 --> 00:44:44.376]  I thank you so much for your call, and Godspeed.
[00:45:01.445 --> 00:45:03.406]  You say you want to fight tyranny.
[00:45:03.406 --> 00:45:06.347]  You say you want to fund the Second American Revolution.
[00:45:06.347 --> 00:45:06.927]  I know you do.
[00:45:06.927 --> 00:45:08.227]  That's why you're here.
[00:45:08.227 --> 00:45:18.590]  So I'm encouraging all of you watching and listening right now to understand that there are really two places in the media that don't back down and that tell the truth, that have great products that are self-funded.
[00:45:18.590 --> 00:45:26.833]  And that's InfoWarsTore.com with the supplements, the books, the films, the water filters, the air filters, all of it, and Mike Lindell and MyPillow.com.

[00:45:34.756 --> 00:45:39.257]  On shoes and beds and sheets and towels and pillows.
[00:45:39.257 --> 00:45:40.298]  The list goes on and on.
[00:45:40.298 --> 00:45:41.338]  Made right here in America.
[00:45:41.338 --> 00:45:41.778]  A 360 win.

[00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:12.421]  Bioremediation is a process used to treat contaminating water, soil, and subsurface material by accelerating naturally occurring environmental conditions to stimulate growth of microorganisms and degrade targeted pollutants.
[00:46:12.421 --> 00:46:19.508]  For the first time, the BioPros are bringing to the public market a suite of bioremediation products to the everyday consumer.
[00:46:19.508 --> 00:46:21.410]  Their first product they are launching is called
[00:46:21.710 --> 00:46:26.674]  BioSeptic Pro, a product specifically designed to establish a healthy septic system.
[00:46:26.674 --> 00:46:31.498]  BioSeptic Pro contains live microorganisms, not traditional enzymes like its competitors.
[00:46:31.498 --> 00:46:33.459]  This stuff lives in your septic system.
[00:46:33.459 --> 00:46:42.786]  It's really like probiotics for your septic tank and is at least 100 times more effective than similar microbial products due to its revolutionary patented delivery system.
[00:46:42.786 --> 00:46:47.590]  BioSeptic Pro contains no chemical ingredients and no genetically modified organisms.
[00:46:47.590 --> 00:46:51.393]  Visit TheBioPros.com today and protect your septic system.
[00:46:51.713 --> 00:46:52.835]  That's TheBiopros.com.
[00:47:25.017 --> 00:47:28.400]  Welcome back!
[00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:29.982]  It really is true, we're the tip of the spear.
[00:47:29.982 --> 00:47:37.168]  And I'm going to talk about the path out of this and the solutions at the start of the next hour.
[00:47:37.168 --> 00:47:43.574]  And I'm also going to lay out what the Globals are going to do next if we don't stop them, which really means we don't have a choice.
[00:47:43.574 --> 00:47:46.196]  There's so much coming up, obviously, today.
[00:47:46.196 --> 00:47:48.759]  Another very, very important broadcast.
[00:47:48.759 --> 00:47:49.840]  We're just blessed to be here.
[00:47:51.834 --> 00:47:55.957]  But let me right now here on the Alex Jones Show get into this.
[00:47:55.957 --> 00:48:00.300]  If I just wanted to make Joe Biden look bad, we could fill the whole four-hour show every day with it.
[00:48:00.300 --> 00:48:02.341]  He's designed to make America look bad.
[00:48:02.341 --> 00:48:04.283]  He's designed to demoralize.
[00:48:04.283 --> 00:48:11.328]  He's designed to make the country look incompetent and under globalist Qaikom control.
[00:48:11.328 --> 00:48:16.031]  And that's why the Taliban has now come out and said, this is a red line.
[00:48:16.031 --> 00:48:19.713]  You will leave by August 31st.
[00:48:21.465 --> 00:48:39.157]  Just a week ago, the leader of the Taliban said you have until September 11th, but they know that Biden is scared and that Biden's basically been ordered to do this by his handlers and is now committed because the Taliban has been in control.
[00:48:40.367 --> 00:48:48.793]  The globalists have been in control of the Taliban since the 1970s and the CIA has had secret agreements with them the entire time.
[00:48:48.793 --> 00:48:59.180]  The truth is the Taliban was not killed or removed on September 11th when the US attacked Kabul on September 12th.
[00:48:59.180 --> 00:49:01.762]  More than 30,000 Taliban were flown out to safety.
[00:49:03.066 --> 00:49:05.689]  In the airlift of evil by the CIA.
[00:49:05.689 --> 00:49:12.458]  The Taliban ordered basically 14 and 15 year old boys to stay in frontline positions to be bombed and killed by the US.
[00:49:12.458 --> 00:49:15.002]  And that whole takeover of Afghanistan was completely staged.
[00:49:16.783 --> 00:49:21.727]  There have been some real tribal groups attacking the troops and some real attacks going on.
[00:49:21.727 --> 00:49:27.012]  And then the Taliban did double back and attack and double cross the CIA, but that's what they do.
[00:49:27.012 --> 00:49:31.335]  So the CIA put the Mullahs in power in Iran in 79.
[00:49:31.335 --> 00:49:34.118]  They put the Taliban in power in 79.
[00:49:34.118 --> 00:49:40.002]  They put Al Qaeda and ISIS and the Taliban in charge of the invasions all over the Middle East and Africa.
[00:49:40.002 --> 00:49:41.964]  And so it's the same story over and over again.
[00:49:41.964 --> 00:49:45.067]  The CIA is run by what ran British intelligence.
[00:49:45.487 --> 00:49:46.868]  It's not British intelligence now.
[00:49:46.868 --> 00:49:49.388]  It's a global corporate criminal combine.
[00:49:49.388 --> 00:49:50.689]  And that's all mainline history.
[00:49:50.689 --> 00:49:51.749]  You saw that in Syria.
[00:49:51.749 --> 00:49:52.930]  You saw it in Libya.
[00:49:52.930 --> 00:49:54.110]  You saw it in Egypt.
[00:49:54.110 --> 00:49:55.871]  You saw Fast and Furious.
[00:49:55.871 --> 00:50:02.093]  More than 5 million guns shipped out of the US to Mexico to be shipped for the Arab Spring by Obama.
[00:50:02.093 --> 00:50:02.433]  And now...
[00:50:03.473 --> 00:50:14.500]  The same law firms suing me and suing others are trying to sue the gun industry out of business, saying it's their fault that guns got into Mexico and went overseas.
[00:50:14.500 --> 00:50:18.342]  And Mexico is now suing 20-plus gun manufacturers.
[00:50:18.342 --> 00:50:22.504]  They'll never sue Obama, who actually ran the whole thing.
[00:50:22.504 --> 00:50:30.449]  Though it did make Eric Holder, then head of the Justice Department, step down when it turned out he was giving the orders directing it.
[00:50:33.027 --> 00:50:39.809]  So this is just all part of the globalists using their secret proxy army.
[00:50:39.809 --> 00:50:45.850]  But now Biden suggests Kamala Harris will be president pretty soon.
[00:50:45.850 --> 00:50:46.530]  He just said this.
[00:50:46.530 --> 00:50:48.430]  Here it is.
[00:50:48.430 --> 00:50:53.892]  My two daughters were born that you can do anything a man can do.
[00:50:53.892 --> 00:50:58.713]  It's one thing for somebody to say that and keep pounding that in the head of their five granddaughters as well.
[00:50:58.713 --> 00:50:59.433]  But guess what?
[00:51:00.413 --> 00:51:05.136]  Until they see it, until they watch, it becomes real then.
[00:51:05.136 --> 00:51:13.660]  That's why, by the way, she happens to be in Asia for me right now, but that's why we have a female vice president of the United States of America.
[00:51:13.660 --> 00:51:17.862]  We're going to have some presidents pretty soon.
[00:51:17.862 --> 00:51:18.523]  Yep, there you go.
[00:51:18.523 --> 00:51:20.424]  It's all been pre-planned, all been prepared.
[00:51:21.411 --> 00:51:24.413]  He's senile, he's blackmailed, he's a Chinese agent.
[00:51:24.413 --> 00:51:29.897]  They got the child porn of him and kids, child porn of him and his son having sex with their own kids, their own family.
[00:51:29.897 --> 00:51:33.520]  It's all on there.
[00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:35.861]  He has sex with all his children.
[00:51:35.861 --> 00:51:38.643]  They all have sex with each other.
[00:51:38.643 --> 00:51:41.305]  His wife wears what a 20-year-old prostitute would wear on TV.
[00:51:41.305 --> 00:51:44.107]  I mean, these people are scum.
[00:51:44.107 --> 00:51:50.832]  You talk about something out of a nightmare, out of a Rob Zombie movie, they are the real deal.
[00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:54.540]  So let's look at some of these headlines.
[00:51:54.540 --> 00:52:02.863]  Negotiating with terrorists, Biden's CIA director, former head of the Carnegie Endowment, fails to secure deadline extension from Taliban.
[00:52:02.863 --> 00:52:06.725]  It's all staged.
[00:52:06.725 --> 00:52:07.565]  Biden told U.S.
[00:52:07.565 --> 00:52:15.267]  commanders not to send out troops to rescue Americans trapped in Kabul because he feared a black lockdown moment.
[00:52:15.267 --> 00:52:16.748]  It would make him look bad.
[00:52:19.491 --> 00:52:24.052]  American mom stranded in Afghanistan tearfully begs Joe Biden to send help.
[00:52:24.052 --> 00:52:27.832]  I don't know if I'm ever going to see my children again.
[00:52:27.832 --> 00:52:29.073]  The Biden effect.
[00:52:29.073 --> 00:52:33.893]  France, UK, Italy, and Germany turned to Putin and Russia for assistance in Afghanistan.
[00:52:33.893 --> 00:52:46.816]  Thanks to the Joe Biden, the Taliban now has over 200 military aircraft, ranks them as the 26th in the list of nations in combat aircraft strength.
[00:52:46.816 --> 00:52:48.156]  You think they couldn't fly aircraft out?
[00:52:49.318 --> 00:52:54.381]  Psaki falsely claims Americans not stranded in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan.
[00:52:54.381 --> 00:52:58.484]  She'll probably claim the vaccine works next, too.
[00:52:58.484 --> 00:53:03.307]  And it just goes on and on and on.
[00:53:03.307 --> 00:53:03.608]  U.S.
[00:53:03.608 --> 00:53:07.770]  collected biometric equipment and data has fallen into the hands of the Taliban.
[00:53:07.770 --> 00:53:08.891]  It's now confirmed.
[00:53:08.891 --> 00:53:13.574]  We weren't sure last week.
[00:53:13.574 --> 00:53:15.436]  But now, supposedly, Biden will order U.S.
[00:53:15.436 --> 00:53:17.417]  troops to rescue Americans stranded in Kabul.
[00:53:19.991 --> 00:53:24.262]  Kamala Harris, though, was over in Singapore and she wouldn't answer questions.
[00:53:24.262 --> 00:53:26.568]  She says, the time for analyzing is later.
[00:53:26.568 --> 00:53:27.190]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:53:27.190 --> 00:53:27.812]  You've forgotten.
[00:53:28.706 --> 00:53:29.006]  About it.
[00:53:29.006 --> 00:53:33.508]  Meanwhile, neocons and left-wingers are pushing, bring all the Afghans here.
[00:53:33.508 --> 00:53:34.688]  Yes.
[00:53:34.688 --> 00:53:37.310]  Yes, we need more people like Ilhan Omar.
[00:53:37.310 --> 00:53:37.690]  The U.S.
[00:53:37.690 --> 00:53:44.012]  should take as many African, excuse me, Afghan refugees as it can.
[00:53:44.012 --> 00:53:50.115]  Think of Ilhan Omar from Somalia, saved as a little girl, and she even attacked the troops that saved her.
[00:53:50.115 --> 00:53:53.096]  She has no level of decency.
[00:53:54.434 --> 00:53:56.255]  And then here's one from Forbes.
[00:53:56.255 --> 00:53:59.077]  Oh, that got mixed in with my Joe Biden stack.
[00:53:59.077 --> 00:54:00.919]  I'd lost this.
[00:54:00.919 --> 00:54:07.643]  Oh, look, Pfizer shot just 39% effective against COVID now.
[00:54:07.643 --> 00:54:10.645]  Oh my gosh, 39%.
[00:54:10.645 --> 00:54:12.747]  But you heard it worked so well.
[00:54:12.747 --> 00:54:13.767]  Next hour, I've got the
[00:54:16.946 --> 00:54:19.870]  Surgeon General saying, oh, natural immunity's not good.
[00:54:19.870 --> 00:54:20.571]  Oh, no, no.
[00:54:20.571 --> 00:54:22.333]  No, no, no, no, no.
[00:54:22.333 --> 00:54:24.275]  They're saying, mother's milk's not good.
[00:54:24.275 --> 00:54:26.458]  No, no, formula's what you want.
[00:54:26.458 --> 00:54:29.662]  But natural immunity's so much better than these shots.
[00:54:29.662 --> 00:54:31.524]  It's saying, you don't want mother's milk.
[00:54:31.524 --> 00:54:35.389]  You want to give the baby cyanide or Drano.
[00:54:36.451 --> 00:54:38.433]  Don't give that baby that.
[00:54:38.433 --> 00:54:40.074]  Babies never drink mother's milk.
[00:54:40.074 --> 00:54:52.944]  You know, I used to joke, and I said, there'll come a time when they claim it's a conspiracy theory that mothers never breastfed, because they're trying to phase that out, because it makes people not as smart, not as healthy, before you get all your natural vaccines as the colostrum.
[00:54:52.944 --> 00:54:54.665]  And now we're pretty much to that point.
[00:54:54.665 --> 00:54:56.646]  Most births are cesarean.
[00:54:56.646 --> 00:54:58.528]  Most people don't breastfeed.
[00:54:58.528 --> 00:54:59.268]  And you can see it.
[00:54:59.268 --> 00:54:59.989]  I mean, it's sad.
[00:54:59.989 --> 00:55:00.850]  People are dull.
[00:55:00.850 --> 00:55:02.591]  They're dumbed down.
[00:55:02.591 --> 00:55:04.252]  They just don't have a life force.
[00:55:04.252 --> 00:55:04.913]  They're asleep.
[00:55:06.224 --> 00:55:17.407]  And that's the thing I found pretty much with anybody, if you can get through to them and get them to make connections to God and the universe and their ancestors, that they can activate and get through the fog and come out of the trance.
[00:55:17.407 --> 00:55:35.371]  And I think more and more, instead of just covering all the news and all the information, we should talk about the spirituality and God and how to get out of the trance and ways to break the conditioning and just, whether you're old or young or black or white or male or female or where you live, the real thing is,
[00:55:37.540 --> 00:55:39.963]  It's a growing process, and I'm not perfect either.
[00:55:39.963 --> 00:55:46.170]  And it's fun to bash liberals, and it's fun to get mad at them, and it's fun to talk about how stupid they are, but that's a reflection on us that we've let that happen.
[00:55:49.727 --> 00:55:55.348]  I love all these people, other than conscious demons like Fauci and Bill Gates and people at the very top.
[00:55:55.348 --> 00:55:57.349]  But most of these people are scared.
[00:55:57.349 --> 00:55:59.309]  They're just trying to belong to something.
[00:55:59.309 --> 00:56:01.390]  They're trying to go along with the system.
[00:56:01.390 --> 00:56:05.651]  And they're finding out they're losing all their medical autonomy, all their future, all their freedom.
[00:56:05.651 --> 00:56:08.611]  And they know deep down that it's a fraud, so they're scared.
[00:56:08.611 --> 00:56:10.612]  And we've got to reach out to them in a loving, nice way.
[00:56:11.820 --> 00:56:12.381]  You know what I mean?
[00:56:30.856 --> 00:56:33.378]  Love is the answer, but also action.
[00:56:33.378 --> 00:56:40.003]  You've got to love people, but you've got to then put the action into it of saying no to the system and then standing in the way of the globalists.
[00:56:40.003 --> 00:56:48.270]  So, we're going to go to break and come back with a really powerful John Bowne report, and then I'm going to get into what the world is going to look like if we don't turn this around.
[00:56:50.581 --> 00:56:53.642]  We don't stop this and why these globalists are doing it.
[00:56:53.642 --> 00:57:13.467]  You know so many times I'm in the morning and I just see the whole future and see all the thousands of data points, millions of data points together and I see the angles of how to stop it and how to overcome it and I have this huge mental picture and then I've got to go on air and explain this to people and then I'll be on air and capture a lot of that same message but then
[00:57:14.537 --> 00:57:18.100]  It's hard to telegraph it forward, but there's been many magic moments on here.
[00:57:18.100 --> 00:57:31.429]  Sometimes three, four minute stream of consciousness where it's just so powerful and you know it's coming from somewhere beyond me and that's what I'm seeking to try to bring you because that's always in my mind.
[00:57:31.429 --> 00:57:33.931]  I know every angle of the enemy, up, down, side, the other, but
[00:57:34.551 --> 00:57:35.592]  Trying to articulate it.
[00:57:35.592 --> 00:57:37.154]  I know you do as well.
[00:57:37.154 --> 00:57:43.721]  The question for all of us is how to articulate the spirit and the discernment we have to the third dimension to save the people and save ourselves.
[00:57:43.721 --> 00:57:44.602]  We'll be right back.
[00:57:44.602 --> 00:57:45.503]  Stay with us.
[00:57:45.503 --> 00:57:46.584]  Pray for justice.
[00:57:46.584 --> 00:57:47.205]  Pray for peace.
[00:57:47.205 --> 00:57:47.806]  Pray for love.
[00:57:49.341 --> 00:57:53.083]  Not all vitamin and mineral supplements are equal.
[00:57:53.083 --> 00:57:54.183]  Many of them are synthetic.
[00:57:54.183 --> 00:57:56.144]  Many of them have fillers and additives.
[00:57:56.144 --> 00:57:59.146]  Many of them just pass right through the body and are not absorbed.
[00:57:59.146 --> 00:58:08.050]  Well, that's not the case with our incredibly popular, because it's so effective, product that has now been sold out for months, but is finally back in stock.
[00:58:08.050 --> 00:58:10.552]  And that is Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:58:10.552 --> 00:58:13.173]  All the essential vitamins, all the essential minerals,
[00:58:13.533 --> 00:58:17.656]  A bunch of key amino acids help it upload better into your body and your cells.
[00:58:17.656 --> 00:58:18.596]  It's in powder form.
[00:58:18.596 --> 00:58:19.797]  It's great for children.
[00:58:19.797 --> 00:58:20.718]  It's great for adults.
[00:58:20.718 --> 00:58:25.521]  It's really important for folks that are older because they don't absorb as well through their guts.
[00:58:25.521 --> 00:58:27.662]  This liquid formula really, really does.
[00:58:27.662 --> 00:58:35.447]  You can mix up a pitcher of it every couple days, put it in the refrigerator, or keep it out in the kitchen, and just remember to drink it in the morning and in the evening.
[00:58:35.447 --> 00:58:36.468]  It tastes great.
[00:58:36.468 --> 00:58:37.808]  It makes your body healthy.
[00:58:37.808 --> 00:58:40.090]  It boosts your immune system, and it
[00:58:48.253 --> 00:58:54.035]  So, when I first started taking Survival Shield, basically, I was 275 pounds.
[00:58:54.035 --> 00:58:55.536]  I was overweight.
[00:58:55.536 --> 00:58:57.797]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe.
[00:58:57.797 --> 00:58:59.758]  I was barely holding on to a job.
[00:58:59.758 --> 00:59:02.238]  And I heard Dr. Group on your show, and I listened to it.
[00:59:02.238 --> 00:59:05.000]  So, the first one I got was the original Survival Shield, the X1.
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:05.400]  And it worked
[00:59:06.220 --> 00:59:06.760]  Pretty good.
[00:59:06.760 --> 00:59:19.503]  And then, shortly thereafter, you came out with X2, you had, you know, with a deep root source, you know, and I got really excited about that, so I took it, and man, in two weeks, I went from brain fog to, like, literally, like, my brain was enlightened, you know?
[00:59:19.503 --> 00:59:20.563]  I could think again.
[00:59:20.563 --> 00:59:22.404]  I could connect with people again.
[00:59:22.404 --> 00:59:28.765]  And over the course of the next couple of years, I got my health back, and I religiously take basically all of your supplements.
[00:59:28.765 --> 00:59:31.146]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[00:59:31.146 --> 00:59:33.046]  The one I like recently is Knockout.
[00:59:33.046 --> 00:59:35.267]  It literally, like, if you want to sleep, just take it.
[00:59:35.267 --> 00:59:35.827]  It's amazing.
[00:59:36.007 --> 00:59:36.527]  It works.
[00:59:36.527 --> 00:59:39.109]  But anyway, so the point is, we have to get ourselves clean.
[00:59:39.109 --> 00:59:41.570]  We have to break free of the globalist system.
[00:59:41.570 --> 00:59:45.252]  And the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hands.
[00:59:45.252 --> 00:59:46.333]  Beautifully said, brother.
[00:59:46.333 --> 00:59:53.116]  I thank you so much for your call, and Godspeed.
[00:59:53.116 --> 00:59:55.738]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:05.609 --> 01:00:12.062]  Alright, John Bowne is always knocking them out of the park, just like our great Gregg Reese and all our other contributors, but he's done three reports the last day.
[01:00:12.062 --> 01:00:14.067]  They're in the John Bowne section of Band Out Video.
[01:00:14.067 --> 01:00:14.908]  Here's one of them.
[01:00:14.908 --> 01:00:16.572]  Media celebrates World War IV.
[01:00:16.572 --> 01:00:16.932]  Here it is.
[01:00:19.591 --> 01:00:33.683]  Vaccine mandates have been what we as Americans have done for the past 50, 60 years to eradicate smallpox, to try to get rid of polio, rubella.
[01:00:33.683 --> 01:00:40.329]  It's just not new and you're acting so shocked and some of you send me emails going, my liberties are being taken.
[01:00:40.329 --> 01:00:41.149]  No, they're not.
[01:00:41.149 --> 01:00:43.912]  No, no more than your liberties were being taken away.
[01:00:44.292 --> 01:00:51.716]  When your parents were told that you couldn't get a public education if you didn't have six vaccine passports.
[01:00:51.716 --> 01:01:02.821]  But these conspiracy theories are not only making people stupid, they're making them sick, and they're causing them to die, and they're acting like this is something new, and that's the most maddening thing.
[01:01:02.821 --> 01:01:05.983]  Oh, you said COVID wasn't real, huh?
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:16.887]  Oh no, it was a real virus they made in the lab, where the vaccine response then causes massive mutations and all these new variants, which I predicted with top scientists on my show.
[01:01:16.887 --> 01:01:20.369]  I'm not even worthy to be bringing you information this powerful.
[01:01:20.369 --> 01:01:26.013]  And I hope that you pay attention to what we cover here, minute by minute.
[01:01:26.013 --> 01:01:29.435]  Because I've had chills since last night.
[01:01:29.435 --> 01:01:32.217]  This just confirms everything else we've already researched.
[01:01:34.830 --> 01:01:47.092]  But Rockefeller study envisions future dictatorship controlled by elite, millions being killed, mandatory quarantines, checkpoints, the end of the family, everything that's in the other documents.
[01:01:49.293 --> 01:02:02.945]  This dovetails with all the other Rockefeller Foundation documents about the GMO food to sterilize you and the forced vaccines and the hell we're already living in that's just going to continue to intensify until we take our governments back from these eugenics madmen.
[01:02:02.945 --> 01:02:06.288]  The question is, will you have the courage to really do the research yourself?
[01:02:06.288 --> 01:02:09.471]  Because I don't want you to just sit here and hear me make these claims.
[01:02:10.552 --> 01:02:22.805]  These people are so arrogant that they write policy papers, so many of them, that they're producing these policy papers and reports and white papers so fast that you could never read them all.
[01:02:22.805 --> 01:02:30.454]  We're seeing a medical tyranny being set up, not just in the United States, but worldwide under the UN and the World Health Organization.
[01:02:30.734 --> 01:02:32.015]  What's behind all this?
[01:02:32.015 --> 01:02:38.018]  The Bilderberg Group, they want a planetary dictatorship so they can carry out their forced depopulation agenda.
[01:02:38.018 --> 01:02:40.119]  And they want to do it through the medical system.
[01:02:40.119 --> 01:02:42.361]  And that's why vaccines are so important.
[01:02:42.361 --> 01:02:46.163]  And I've got an insider I think you should really talk to, Dr. Rima Labo.
[01:02:46.403 --> 01:02:56.009]  Very soon, we'll be facing compulsory vaccination under the mistaken term of voluntary vaccination.
[01:02:56.009 --> 01:03:04.595]  But first of all, let's start with the fact that the World Health Organization has decided that we have 90% too many people.
[01:03:04.595 --> 01:03:09.698]  My name is Dr. Sean Brooks, PhD, Oxford.
[01:03:10.526 --> 01:03:20.029]  Dr. Robert Malone who created the messenger RNA vaccine has said no one should ever take these jabs ever under any circumstance whatsoever.
[01:03:20.029 --> 01:03:22.931]  He created it and he says don't ever do it.
[01:03:22.931 --> 01:03:29.113]  The people who have taken it are going to die in the next six months to three to five years for three reasons.
[01:03:29.113 --> 01:03:29.573]  Number one,
[01:03:30.267 --> 01:03:33.968]  You've dramatically decreased your own immune system by 35%.
[01:03:33.968 --> 01:03:37.649]  The first jab did it by at least 15.
[01:03:37.649 --> 01:03:40.310]  The second did it by 35 now.
[01:03:40.310 --> 01:03:43.170]  If you take any booster shot, you will die.
[01:03:43.170 --> 01:03:44.411]  That's it.
[01:03:44.411 --> 01:03:48.372]  You take a flu shot in the future, you will die.
[01:03:48.372 --> 01:03:49.152]  The second reason.
[01:03:49.611 --> 01:03:51.571]  Antibody Dependent Enhancement.
[01:03:51.571 --> 01:03:56.893]  Antibody Dependent Enhancement is what is happening with these jabs with everybody who has taken them.
[01:03:56.893 --> 01:03:59.113]  Unless, of course, you've taken a placebo.
[01:03:59.113 --> 01:04:01.234]  But there's no way that you would know that.
[01:04:01.234 --> 01:04:09.836]  So given that fact, Antibody Dependent Enhancement tricks the entire body into believing that the cell that's eating the pathogen is eating it when it isn't.
[01:04:09.836 --> 01:04:14.297]  It ends up leading to what's called a cytokine storm, which causes organ failure.
[01:04:15.933 --> 01:04:18.774]  That will cause your death, and there's no stopping that.
[01:04:18.774 --> 01:04:20.814]  No amount of drugs will stop that.
[01:04:20.814 --> 01:04:23.715]  The third thing, blood clotting.
[01:04:23.715 --> 01:04:26.375]  Everyone who has taken the jabs is blood clotting.
[01:04:26.375 --> 01:04:29.336]  If you don't believe me, there's a way you can find out.
[01:04:29.336 --> 01:04:32.016]  Take what's called a D-dimer test.
[01:04:32.016 --> 01:04:37.638]  What that does is that detects blood clotting at the microscopic level.
[01:04:37.638 --> 01:04:40.418]  They're cutting full blood clots out of people right now.
[01:04:40.418 --> 01:04:43.479]  As I'm talking to you, millions have died from the jabs.
[01:04:43.479 --> 01:04:44.199]  Perfect plan.
[01:04:45.643 --> 01:04:51.766]  The first time I heard the speech, the first time I read the writings of Teddy Roosevelt, I was in 6th grade.
[01:05:09.275 --> 01:05:14.458]  We had this history teacher that had us write a paper on the man of the arena.
[01:05:14.458 --> 01:05:18.300]  And I just remember thinking about that and saying, I want to be the man of the arena.
[01:05:18.300 --> 01:05:21.582]  But when it comes to media, Infowars has been the tip of that spear.
[01:05:21.582 --> 01:05:29.846]  But Mike Lindell has come along and done just as good a job as we've done, maybe even better when it comes to election fraud and other issues.
[01:05:29.846 --> 01:05:33.268]  And that's why if you go to MyPillow.com and use promo code ALEX,
[01:05:34.048 --> 01:05:37.570]  You get up to 66% off on all the amazing products.
[01:05:37.570 --> 01:05:40.831]  He's got so many, not just pillows, not just towels, not just sheets.
[01:05:40.831 --> 01:05:45.673]  And then you fund InfoWars and Mike Lindell and the fight for free speech against the globalists.
[01:05:45.673 --> 01:05:49.995]  There's not a better place to spend your money than MyPillow.com with promo code Alex.
[01:05:49.995 --> 01:05:56.158]  And if you do it, it funds the InfoWars, it funds the election investigation, and it stands up against these globalist bullies.
[01:05:56.158 --> 01:05:58.779]  MyPillow.com, promo code Alex.
[01:05:58.779 --> 01:05:59.580]  Take action now.
[01:06:04.707 --> 01:06:09.549]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-up.
[01:06:09.549 --> 01:06:11.230]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:06:11.230 --> 01:06:12.910]  Well, so does he.
[01:06:12.910 --> 01:06:19.393]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:19.393 --> 01:06:26.235]  And we are now into hour number two on this August 24th Tuesday transmission.
[01:06:26.235 --> 01:06:30.417]  I'm your host Alex Jones and I'm very, very blessed and honored to be here with you.
[01:06:34.170 --> 01:06:37.771]  Okay, let's tell you what's coming up this hour.
[01:06:37.771 --> 01:06:51.055]  We've got a lot of economic news, a lot of military news, a lot of medical news, a lot of police state news on the whole Homeland Security move to declare conservatives and Christians as the main terror threat.
[01:06:51.055 --> 01:07:03.119]  But I want to talk about the big lie of the vaccine mandates and that these are supposedly vaccines and where all this is going if we don't stop it.
[01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:05.380]  We're good to go.
[01:07:21.704 --> 01:07:28.327]  Coming with hypotheses of how it would roll out, which have been dead on, we're now almost two years into the takeover.
[01:07:28.327 --> 01:07:32.328]  And it's going exactly as our worst analysis said it would.
[01:07:32.328 --> 01:07:41.051]  And so that means that you better brace yourself and get ready for what is about to be unfolding and happening.
[01:07:41.051 --> 01:07:47.694]  And the big question is, how is the system going to spin
[01:07:49.110 --> 01:07:55.633]  The massive numbers of people dying of blood clots and autoimmune disorders and organ failure.
[01:07:55.633 --> 01:07:56.694]  How are they going to spend that?
[01:07:56.694 --> 01:07:57.474]  And it's quite easy.
[01:07:57.474 --> 01:08:05.258]  They're going to say that new variants of COVID-19 have done it.
[01:08:05.258 --> 01:08:07.519]  And so they've been planning this for a very long time.
[01:08:07.519 --> 01:08:10.101]  And they can say, oh, we've always had vaccine mandates.
[01:08:10.101 --> 01:08:17.905]  Yes, they've always, since the 30s with eugenics mandates, injected poor people with all sorts of experimental shots that
[01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:21.802]  Created huge scandals all over the world killing them.
[01:08:21.802 --> 01:08:34.111]  And Pfizer is the number one company in the world that's paid the most fines, had the most criminal charges for injecting people with experimental drugs and other things around the world and killing them.
[01:08:34.111 --> 01:08:44.258]  And that's in John Bowne's excellent report that he just put out today dealing with the huge global awakening that's happening.
[01:08:44.258 --> 01:08:45.740]  He's got a bunch of clips
[01:08:46.727 --> 01:08:50.429]  of crimes that Pfizer's committed.
[01:08:50.429 --> 01:08:57.273]  And did you know the lady they put at the head of the FDA to get all this emergency approval and now official approval?
[01:08:57.273 --> 01:09:05.957]  Do you know that she's the lady that was in the agency before who approved OxyContin?
[01:09:05.957 --> 01:09:09.579]  Which they prove was a plan to get millions addicted and kill millions.
[01:09:09.579 --> 01:09:12.720]  It was even in the plan of the drug company to addict people.
[01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:14.281]  That's all on record.
[01:09:14.281 --> 01:09:15.262]  What could be worse
[01:09:16.479 --> 01:09:24.223]  Then purposely authorizing because she was given campaign money and the political party she was involved in were Democrats mainly.
[01:09:24.223 --> 01:09:25.323]  Republicans were involved as well.
[01:09:25.323 --> 01:09:28.285]  Frank Luntz was the lobbyist.
[01:09:28.285 --> 01:09:29.225]  What could be worse?
[01:09:29.225 --> 01:09:38.210]  Could she, the woman at the FDA who just approved all this, to go after our children and all of it, could she do something worse?
[01:09:38.210 --> 01:09:42.432]  The answer is yes, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:09:43.422 --> 01:09:45.464]  And it's all in John Bowne's report.
[01:09:45.464 --> 01:09:47.705]  She did something even worse.
[01:09:47.705 --> 01:10:04.278]  Ladies and gentlemen, 20-something years ago, MIT developed a drug 50 to 100 times, depending on the design of it, depending on the type, stronger than heroin.
[01:10:04.278 --> 01:10:05.599]  Oxycontin is as strong as heroin.
[01:10:09.892 --> 01:10:23.563]  The woman that headed up the program at the FDA to authorize these frankenshots, and now this authorization, is the one that legalized the production of fentanyl.
[01:10:23.563 --> 01:10:25.765]  Fentanyl.
[01:10:25.765 --> 01:10:27.126]  You think about that.
[01:10:27.126 --> 01:10:29.248]  So are these some killers?
[01:10:29.248 --> 01:10:30.609]  You talking about some murderers here?
[01:10:30.609 --> 01:10:33.692]  Oh yeah, are they coming for us?
[01:10:33.692 --> 01:10:35.574]  You better bet they are.
[01:10:35.574 --> 01:10:37.295]  Oxycontin.
[01:10:37.295 --> 01:10:37.735]  Fentanyl.
[01:10:38.777 --> 01:10:41.798]  Gene therapy injections that change your cells.
[01:10:41.798 --> 01:10:51.440]  Look, this Remdesivir that we've been seeing getting pushed by Fauci and people has less than 8% efficacy and it cost a bunch of money.
[01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:53.441]  They made money off that, didn't help people.
[01:10:53.441 --> 01:10:57.502]  But notice what they're not been promoting, Regeneron.
[01:10:57.502 --> 01:11:04.023]  Regeneron creates a bunch of clone white blood cells for mice, trains them to only kill COVID, puts them in you.
[01:11:04.023 --> 01:11:07.404]  They're all screens, which is not like from prisoners or something, they're blood.
[01:11:08.723 --> 01:11:11.665]  And it goes in with basically no side effects, cleans everything out.
[01:11:11.665 --> 01:11:16.688]  Now there might be stuff we don't know about long term, no short term stuff really.
[01:11:16.688 --> 01:11:25.252]  Because it doesn't change your body, it sends something in that goes through and cleans it out and then you urinate it and defecate it out.
[01:11:25.252 --> 01:11:27.294]  You pass it through your body, through your gallbladder.
[01:11:33.527 --> 01:11:35.428]  That company has liability.
[01:11:35.428 --> 01:11:36.528]  They've been around since the 80s.
[01:11:36.528 --> 01:11:38.169]  They've got a bunch of stuff that's been proven to work.
[01:11:38.169 --> 01:11:44.712]  They have patented antibodies that are 100% cure one form of skin cancer.
[01:11:44.712 --> 01:11:45.892]  And I wish them all the luck.
[01:11:45.892 --> 01:11:47.653]  I'm Mr. Buck Rogers.
[01:11:47.653 --> 01:11:49.153]  I'm Mr. George Jetson, baby.
[01:11:49.153 --> 01:11:50.254]  I love technology.
[01:11:50.254 --> 01:11:55.056]  If it's vetted, if it doesn't have liability protection, and if it's transparent.
[01:12:01.474 --> 01:12:07.696]  And I'm glad that the governor of Texas has authorized, for people that need it, free Regeneron.
[01:12:07.696 --> 01:12:13.278]  And the company's passed it on for no profit and is doing that.
[01:12:13.278 --> 01:12:16.979]  So see, I'm all about real stuff.
[01:12:16.979 --> 01:12:19.020]  And are you rolling the dice when you take Regeneron?
[01:12:19.020 --> 01:12:21.901]  You might be.
[01:12:21.901 --> 01:12:23.502]  But does it go in and change your cells?
[01:12:23.502 --> 01:12:24.202]  Nope.
[01:12:24.202 --> 01:12:25.422]  Doesn't do anything to your cells.
[01:12:25.422 --> 01:12:26.443]  Doesn't tell your cells what to do.
[01:12:26.443 --> 01:12:28.263]  Doesn't take control of your cells.
[01:12:28.263 --> 01:12:29.564]  It sends cloned,
[01:12:31.661 --> 01:12:41.308]  Mice, white blood cells, who've been brought up in vats with COVID-19.
[01:12:41.308 --> 01:12:42.148]  And they know how to eat it.
[01:12:42.148 --> 01:12:43.589]  That's all they eat.
[01:12:43.589 --> 01:12:45.731]  They kill one thing.
[01:12:45.731 --> 01:12:50.894]  And I know now, four people that have taken it in Austin, who couldn't breathe, they're about to die.
[01:12:50.894 --> 01:12:54.197]  And it was just within four or five hours, they were just completely, completely fine.
[01:12:54.197 --> 01:12:57.439]  Just like Trump said, it was like they took it, it was like within four or five hours.
[01:12:57.439 --> 01:13:00.161]  A couple of them got a really bad headache, but that was it.
[01:13:01.758 --> 01:13:04.245]  Then it's gone like in a day.
[01:13:04.245 --> 01:13:06.532]  And I would imagine having a bunch of white blood cells crawling through your brain.
[01:13:07.281 --> 01:13:18.306]  Probably that aren't yours, probably doesn't feel too good, but we are at the Buck Rogers moment, and see, the globalists don't want us to have all the clean, or cleaner, transparent technology.
[01:13:18.306 --> 01:13:33.212]  They want, out of Big Pharma and out of DARPA that set up Moderna and all this, no liability, total secrecy, no animal testing, no human testing, because they already secretly did it, to roll out something that isn't designed to help you, like Regeneron,
[01:13:35.157 --> 01:13:46.004]  It's designed to hurt you, and that's what all the scientists who looked at it, they said, this will protect you, this will lower your immune system, this will create mutant viruses.
[01:13:46.004 --> 01:13:58.493]  And then it all comes out that the new Delta strain and all this is from the vaccinated, and they had headlines all over the country and MSNBC and CNN and everything else going, look at what a dumbass Alex Jones is.
[01:14:00.785 --> 01:14:01.665]  Why, ha!
[01:14:01.665 --> 01:14:05.967]  He says the vaccine makes you become a mutant.
[01:14:05.967 --> 01:14:09.008]  He also said the frogs are gay from Atrazine.
[01:14:09.008 --> 01:14:12.089]  No, I didn't say you become a mutant, though technically you do.
[01:14:12.089 --> 01:14:15.831]  Just not in the science fiction version where you have like three heads or whatever.
[01:14:15.831 --> 01:14:18.292]  That'll just be your children.
[01:14:18.292 --> 01:14:19.552]  Literally, in the studies.
[01:14:19.552 --> 01:14:20.313]  In rats.
[01:14:20.313 --> 01:14:23.534]  Massive deformities in their offspring, if they're even able to have them.
[01:14:24.813 --> 01:14:30.296]  No, it's mutants in the cells, mutants in the sloughing, the shedding.
[01:14:30.296 --> 01:14:34.058]  This is the reality.
[01:14:34.058 --> 01:14:42.904]  So, we put together a little compilation we'll cover when we come back with the Surgeon General saying natural immunity is no good.
[01:14:42.904 --> 01:14:46.306]  It's like saying again, mother's milk is no good, cyanide is good for babies.
[01:14:47.233 --> 01:14:50.955]  And, but then he, in the next cut, oh, the vaccines don't work anymore.
[01:14:50.955 --> 01:14:58.157]  This is day-to-day, oh, it's the best thing ever, gold standard, you'll never need anything, but it doesn't work, and you need more shots.
[01:14:58.157 --> 01:14:59.698]  And then Fauci saying the same thing.
[01:14:59.698 --> 01:15:03.420]  I mean, they act like we're morons, and here's the deal.
[01:15:03.420 --> 01:15:06.401]  The average person's not really a moron.
[01:15:06.401 --> 01:15:09.362]  They're experts on their favorite TV show, their favorite video game.
[01:15:10.788 --> 01:15:14.510]  Or how to go to work, get their job done, and go home and sit in front of the TV.
[01:15:14.510 --> 01:15:17.030]  And I used to be like that for a little while, I guess, in high school.
[01:15:17.030 --> 01:15:18.771]  A little bit in college, not much.
[01:15:18.771 --> 01:15:20.992]  I mean, it's just, it's a dead feeling.
[01:15:20.992 --> 01:15:22.373]  But people do it.
[01:15:22.373 --> 01:15:28.675]  And as soon as you get into the real world, and as soon as you figure out how stuff works, it's not work to read documents.
[01:15:28.675 --> 01:15:30.096]  It's not work to research stuff.
[01:15:30.096 --> 01:15:34.317]  Man, the more you learn, the more you want to know.
[01:15:34.317 --> 01:15:35.778]  And it just becomes totally addicting.
[01:15:36.894 --> 01:15:38.675]  And then you're 10 steps ahead of the globalists.
[01:15:38.675 --> 01:15:43.036]  I mean, if I wanted to, if people like me that were awake wanted to take over, we could.
[01:15:43.036 --> 01:15:44.276]  My job is not to take over.
[01:15:44.276 --> 01:15:47.757]  As the globalists always say, if you're resisting tyranny, you just want to be the elite.
[01:15:47.757 --> 01:15:48.537]  No, no, no, no.
[01:15:48.537 --> 01:15:49.658]  I don't want to replace the elite.
[01:15:49.658 --> 01:15:52.159]  I want to get rid of them and change the world for the better.
[01:15:52.159 --> 01:15:54.239]  I want a revolution of human empowerment.
[01:15:54.239 --> 01:15:55.720]  And I'm here to do it with you.
[01:15:55.720 --> 01:15:56.100]  Stay with us.
[01:15:56.100 --> 01:15:56.560]  We'll be right back.
[01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:03.902]  Your voice counts.
[01:16:03.902 --> 01:16:08.968]  When you share information, be it over the internet or in person, it changes the world.
[01:16:08.968 --> 01:16:11.571]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[01:16:11.571 --> 01:16:13.053]  They know you're angry.
[01:16:13.053 --> 01:16:17.878]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.

[01:17:59.929 --> 01:18:07.453]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone from beta testing to operational.
[01:18:07.453 --> 01:18:12.955]  The globalists are out in the open with their planetary depopulation takeover, their robot takeover.
[01:18:12.955 --> 01:18:20.499]  But the good news is we've been working and you've been working and others have been working across the planet for decades to get ready for this, to be able to fight it off.

[01:20:19.469 --> 01:20:25.497]  The vaunted, the hated, the battle-hardened InfoWars.
[01:20:25.497 --> 01:20:28.601]  Live flagship transmission.
[01:20:28.601 --> 01:20:29.663]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:32.972 --> 01:20:34.833]  And I am just so thankful to this crew.
[01:20:34.833 --> 01:20:36.354]  I love this crew.
[01:20:36.354 --> 01:20:38.315]  And I'm so thankful to all of you out there.
[01:20:38.315 --> 01:20:39.035]  I love you.
[01:20:39.035 --> 01:20:41.096]  And we are all in this together.
[01:20:41.096 --> 01:20:45.898]  Okay, next segment, I'm gonna get into the Globalist Big Plan and where they will be taking us.
[01:20:45.898 --> 01:20:47.039]  We don't resist and fight back.
[01:20:47.039 --> 01:20:52.261]  But the examples of fighting back all over the world that are turning the tide right now.
[01:20:52.261 --> 01:20:54.162]  So this is just an amazing time to be alive.
[01:20:54.162 --> 01:20:55.963]  This is the main enemy attack.
[01:20:55.963 --> 01:20:56.783]  It's their main move.
[01:20:56.783 --> 01:20:58.344]  And it's a good thing it's now out in the open.
[01:20:59.801 --> 01:21:03.503]  So, we know what happens to tyrants every time they try this.
[01:21:03.503 --> 01:21:12.828]  It may take 10 years, it may take 50 years, it may take 6 months, but we're going to beat them and wake up and have a new renaissance.
[01:21:12.828 --> 01:21:15.250]  Okay, so let's talk about criminal fraud.
[01:21:15.250 --> 01:21:16.990]  Let's talk about lies.
[01:21:16.990 --> 01:21:20.452]  The PCR test was the basis of all the false positives, 94% at least.
[01:21:22.861 --> 01:21:22.981]  Let's
[01:21:43.700 --> 01:21:45.360]  They lied about the Wuhan lab.
[01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:46.341]  They lied about treatments.
[01:21:46.341 --> 01:21:47.441]  They blocked treatments.
[01:21:47.441 --> 01:21:52.523]  They sent sick people to nursing homes because the virus wasn't spreading very good.
[01:21:52.523 --> 01:21:57.924]  It was a deadly virus if you were actually able to get it and didn't have enough vitamins or minerals.
[01:21:57.924 --> 01:22:01.005]  So now I believe they actually separately released some other spike protein stuff.
[01:22:01.005 --> 01:22:01.745]  I agree with Mike Adams.
[01:22:01.745 --> 01:22:10.388]  But we also have the studies and real scientists looking at it that after the inoculations began in England first, you suddenly see giant variants popping up.
[01:22:10.388 --> 01:22:11.308]  And the same thing here.
[01:22:12.429 --> 01:22:12.989]  We're good to go.
[01:22:28.581 --> 01:22:39.426]  And the system hopping mad that folks are learning about ivermectin and learning about Regeneron and learning about all the other things that are out there like hydroxychloroquine.
[01:22:39.426 --> 01:22:44.788]  Thanks to all the great people like Dr. Zelenko and others that have been exposing it.
[01:22:44.788 --> 01:22:50.530]  So income criminal, big pharma operatives that want to be part of the revolving door in government.
[01:22:50.530 --> 01:22:54.532]  This is Vivek Murthy, the puppet, born in 1977.
[01:22:57.901 --> 01:23:00.002]  We're good to go.
[01:23:19.520 --> 01:23:20.381]  That's all the evidence.
[01:23:20.381 --> 01:23:30.749]  So here he is saying this is better immunity, whereas a normal inoculation will give you some immunity, but they admit maybe 10% of what natural is, depending on what it is.
[01:23:30.749 --> 01:23:33.051]  I mean, natural can last your whole life.
[01:23:33.051 --> 01:23:42.098]  They found people that were 90 years old who'd gotten infected with the Spanish flu when they were 10 years old, and they still had total immunity to it.
[01:23:42.098 --> 01:23:45.061]  Okay, so saying this is again like saying
[01:23:47.349 --> 01:23:52.191]  The football team in Dallas is not the Dallas Cowboys, it's the Dallas Horndogs.
[01:23:52.191 --> 01:23:53.571]  It's just not true.
[01:23:53.571 --> 01:23:54.451]  But they say it.
[01:23:54.451 --> 01:23:56.692]  He's like, yeah, it's the Dallas Horndogs.
[01:23:56.692 --> 01:23:57.612]  They're like, no, it's the Cowboys.
[01:23:57.612 --> 01:24:00.373]  No, it's not.
[01:24:00.373 --> 01:24:02.174]  Or Superman wears a green cape.
[01:24:02.174 --> 01:24:04.154]  No, he doesn't.
[01:24:04.154 --> 01:24:06.115]  Or George Washington wasn't our first president.
[01:24:06.115 --> 01:24:12.457]  I mean, the lie level, and that's what all the medical doctors say, and the epidemiology and virology and immunity.
[01:24:12.457 --> 01:24:13.677]  I mean, this is a fact.
[01:24:13.677 --> 01:24:14.138]  It's insane.
[01:24:16.860 --> 01:24:19.160]  It's insane.
[01:24:19.160 --> 01:24:20.421]  But that's what these criminals do.
[01:24:20.421 --> 01:24:25.162]  Remember they tried a few months ago, oh, 99% in the hospital didn't take the vaccine.
[01:24:25.162 --> 01:24:31.343]  Turned out it was actually worldwide, 85% in the hospital that had the vaccine that were sick from COVID.
[01:24:31.343 --> 01:24:34.403]  So everything is upside down world.
[01:24:34.403 --> 01:24:37.264]  And then he quote, is countering misinformation.
[01:24:37.264 --> 01:24:40.604]  So here he is saying, oh, your natural immunity is not good.
[01:24:40.604 --> 01:24:42.585]  Then saying, oh, but the vaccine doesn't work.
[01:24:42.585 --> 01:24:42.985]  Oh, really?
[01:24:45.333 --> 01:24:46.854]  And then I've got the articles right here.
[01:24:46.854 --> 01:24:50.837]  Pfizer shot just 39% effective now.
[01:24:50.837 --> 01:24:53.038]  That's Forbes.
[01:24:53.038 --> 01:24:54.019]  Here's Bloomberg.
[01:24:54.019 --> 01:24:58.342]  Vaccinated people may be more vulnerable to serious illnesses from COVID Delta variant.
[01:24:58.342 --> 01:25:01.604]  Previously thought, oh Bloomberg, now you need the booster.
[01:25:01.604 --> 01:25:03.706]  See how it works?
[01:25:03.706 --> 01:25:05.127]  Because they got their new product for you.
[01:25:06.340 --> 01:25:09.462]  They're murdering logic because logic stands in their way.
[01:25:09.462 --> 01:25:10.603]  They're doing it on purpose.
[01:25:10.603 --> 01:25:12.144]  They're gaslighting you.
[01:25:12.144 --> 01:25:14.786]  So this guy's really a slimy little bastard.
[01:25:14.786 --> 01:25:16.367]  Here he is.
[01:25:16.367 --> 01:25:29.416]  We are seeing more and more data that tells us that while you get some protection from natural infection, it's not nearly as strong as what you get from the vaccine, especially with the Delta variant, which is the hardiest and most contagious variant we've seen to date.
[01:25:30.177 --> 01:25:37.941]  It is now our clinical judgment that the time to lay out a plan for COVID-19 boosters is now.
[01:25:37.941 --> 01:25:44.704]  Recent data makes clear that protection against mild and moderate disease has decreased over time.
[01:25:44.704 --> 01:25:50.566]  This is likely due to both waning immunity and the strength of the widespread Delta variant.
[01:25:53.302 --> 01:25:54.382]  Start the whole thing over in a moment.
[01:26:23.482 --> 01:26:37.326]  We are seeing more and more data that tells us that while you get some protection from natural infection, it's not nearly as strong as what you get from the vaccine, especially with the Delta variant, which is the hardiest and most contagious variant we've seen to date.
[01:26:37.326 --> 01:26:45.109]  It is now our clinical judgment that the time to lay out a plan for COVID-19 boosters is now.
[01:26:45.109 --> 01:26:50.811]  Recent data makes clear that protection against mild and moderate disease has decreased over time.
[01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:58.785]  This is likely due to both waning immunity and the strength of the widespread Delta variant.
[01:26:58.785 --> 01:27:12.614]  And Dr. Botticieri, at the same time, natural immunity has essentially been kind of tossed aside by Dr. Fauci, and he's spoken about this directly.
[01:27:12.614 --> 01:27:12.874]  Watch.
[01:27:14.741 --> 01:27:20.147]  Vaccination in people previously infected significantly boosts the immune response.
[01:27:20.147 --> 01:27:25.654]  Vaccines actually, at least with regard to SARS-CoV-2, can do better than nature.
[01:27:27.029 --> 01:27:29.210]  But take a look at the data out of Israel.
[01:27:29.210 --> 01:27:35.293]  Those who recovered from COVID-19 may be better protected from reinfection than those who received the vaccine.
[01:27:35.293 --> 01:27:46.679]  Since May 1st, 72 people previously had COVID were infected again, accounting for 1% of confirmed new cases, while 3,000 who were vaccinated have been infected.
[01:27:46.679 --> 01:27:50.261]  40% of confirmed new cases.
[01:27:50.261 --> 01:27:50.722]  Now, Doctor,
[01:27:52.925 --> 01:27:54.507]  Well, hit pause.
[01:27:54.507 --> 01:27:55.509]  That's super old numbers.
[01:27:55.509 --> 01:27:57.793]  Now it's over 85% are vaccinated and they're in the hospital.
[01:27:57.793 --> 01:27:58.353]  Go back to her.
[01:28:01.778 --> 01:28:03.099]  He's ignored the data on this.
[01:28:03.099 --> 01:28:11.845]  There was a fantastic study out of the Cleveland Clinic that found the same thing, that the people who had recovered from COVID were actually quite well protected against severe disease and reinfection.
[01:28:11.845 --> 01:28:13.527]  I don't understand why they've done that.
[01:28:13.527 --> 01:28:24.094]  Actually, it discriminates against all of the working class people who've come down with COVID, recovered from it, because we deemed them essential, didn't protect them, while protecting the laptop class.
[01:28:24.094 --> 01:28:27.437]  And now we say, OK, that natural immunity doesn't count for anything.
[01:28:27.817 --> 01:28:34.079]  You don't have the vaccine, so you can't go to a restaurant or to a ball game or something.
[01:28:34.079 --> 01:28:34.599]  That's right.
[01:28:34.599 --> 01:28:35.160]  That's good.
[01:28:35.160 --> 01:28:36.780]  And here's the deal, guys.
[01:28:36.780 --> 01:28:41.422]  They're taking control of the normal human biological system and saying you don't have an immune system.
[01:28:41.422 --> 01:28:42.882]  Mothers can't give milk to babies.
[01:28:42.882 --> 01:28:45.663]  Women can't give birth vaginally.
[01:28:45.663 --> 01:28:47.184]  Your natural immunity doesn't work.
[01:28:47.184 --> 01:28:49.384]  We've got to put you in a bubble and control your life.
[01:28:49.384 --> 01:28:50.245]  Just stay in your bubble.
[01:28:50.245 --> 01:28:51.485]  Don't look at the sunset.
[01:28:51.485 --> 01:28:52.405]  Don't talk to your neighbors.
[01:28:52.405 --> 01:28:54.006]  I mean, this is really happening.
[01:28:54.006 --> 01:28:55.466]  This is the pod people.
[01:28:55.466 --> 01:28:57.027]  They're trying to make us the pod people.
[01:28:57.307 --> 01:28:58.229]  Wake up!
[01:28:58.229 --> 01:28:59.232]  Break your conditioning!

[01:29:59.946 --> 01:30:05.211]  The best product, I'm not supposed to be biased, but I'm going to tell you all now, if you haven't tried TurboForce, you need to try it.
[01:30:05.211 --> 01:30:07.953]  I've tried TurboForce with everything.
[01:30:07.953 --> 01:30:09.655]  Sometimes, you know, I went a little bit crazy.
[01:30:09.655 --> 01:30:11.316]  I put TurboForce in my coffee.
[01:30:11.316 --> 01:30:12.277]  That was a crazy week.
[01:30:12.277 --> 01:30:23.948]  I don't remember sleeping, but as far as the products go, TurboForce is my favorite, and all the Infowars products are down to taking control of your life, taking control of your health, and not relying on other people to do it for you.
[01:30:23.948 --> 01:30:25.269]  Nobody wakes up in the morning
[01:30:26.741 --> 01:30:26.901]  I don't
[01:30:48.626 --> 01:30:49.787]  I don't want to take control of my life.
[01:30:49.787 --> 01:30:50.908]  I want to take control of my health.
[01:30:50.908 --> 01:30:54.811]  And that's why you need to go to InfoWars.com and take control of your health right now and support the resistance.

[01:30:58.114 --> 01:31:00.355]  Kool-Aid's bad and the TurboForce is good.

[01:32:00.336 --> 01:32:04.080]  Not all vitamin and mineral supplements are equal.
[01:32:04.080 --> 01:32:05.181]  Many of them are synthetic.
[01:32:05.181 --> 01:32:07.143]  Many of them have fillers and additives.
[01:32:07.143 --> 01:32:10.166]  Many of them just pass right through the body and are not absorbed.
[01:32:10.166 --> 01:32:18.454]  Well, that's not the case with our incredibly popular, because it's so effective, product that has now been sold out for months, but is finally back in stock.

[01:32:34.216 --> 01:32:38.760]  Because they don't absorb as well through their guts, so this liquid formula really, really does.

[01:32:46.447 --> 01:32:53.574]  It tastes great, it makes your body healthy, it boosts your immune system, and it funds the end of the Cold War.

[01:33:02.614 --> 01:33:05.210]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:13.226 --> 01:33:21.231]  The year is 1995, and InfoWars launches the last of America's counter-globalist probes.
[01:33:21.231 --> 01:33:35.780]  In a freak mishap, InfoWars.com and Alex Jones are blown out of their trajectory into an orbit which freezes his life support systems, and returns Alex Jones to Earth 25 years later.
[01:33:35.780 --> 01:33:39.222]  Trans-dimensionally, over the space-time continuum through full space-time.
[01:33:39.562 --> 01:33:43.924]  Where people aren't extremely lazy, the social engineers are there laughing.
[01:33:43.924 --> 01:33:48.707]  What we envisioned 100 years ago, 20 years ago, is now reality.
[01:33:48.707 --> 01:34:05.035]  While the society unravels, men run around totally frantic, not knowing how to be men, and women run around frantic, not knowing how to be women, and they don't understand that it's an animating contest of life, and that it's fulfilling to be informed, it's fulfilling to be involved, it's fulfilling.
[01:34:05.035 --> 01:34:06.136]  InfoWars.
[01:34:06.136 --> 01:34:07.297]  Tomorrow's news.
[01:34:07.297 --> 01:34:07.617]  Today.
[01:34:15.342 --> 01:34:27.774]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:34:27.774 --> 01:34:30.817]  This is it, man.
[01:34:30.817 --> 01:34:35.201]  Toe to toe with the globalists.
[01:34:35.201 --> 01:34:39.065]  We're not waiting for the new world order anymore.
[01:34:39.065 --> 01:34:40.406]  We have now entered Mordor.
[01:34:44.603 --> 01:34:46.264]  And the globalists think they're going to trick us.
[01:34:46.264 --> 01:34:49.845]  They think they can get people to sign on to be left alone.
[01:34:49.845 --> 01:34:55.248]  And if you just give them a little freedom, the system will leave you alone.
[01:34:55.248 --> 01:34:58.269]  But every time you give up freedom, they demand even more.
[01:34:58.269 --> 01:35:02.071]  Look at how they told them, take the injections and then you can not wear the mask.
[01:35:02.071 --> 01:35:03.311]  You can go wherever you want.
[01:35:03.311 --> 01:35:04.372]  Oh, sorry.
[01:35:04.372 --> 01:35:05.352]  Got to still wear the mask.
[01:35:05.352 --> 01:35:06.473]  Got to take more shots.
[01:35:07.677 --> 01:35:09.278]  Oh, and you're really sick now.
[01:35:09.278 --> 01:35:11.459]  Oh, the Delta variant's gonna get you.
[01:35:11.459 --> 01:35:14.641]  You're sick from the vaccine, because it's not a vaccine.
[01:35:14.641 --> 01:35:16.622]  It's growing prion crystals.
[01:35:16.622 --> 01:35:20.043]  You're diseasing others now.
[01:35:20.043 --> 01:35:26.186]  It's all a well laid out plan.
[01:35:26.186 --> 01:35:30.689]  And I can talk about answers on the way to resist this, and I'll do that next segment.
[01:35:30.689 --> 01:35:33.150]  But I wanted the time we have left in this segment to get into
[01:35:35.362 --> 01:35:37.483]  Currently the trajectory we're on.
[01:35:37.483 --> 01:35:40.285]  And again, I want to be extremely clear about this.
[01:35:40.285 --> 01:35:44.308]  We had all the white papers, the globalist plans, beta tests they'd done before.
[01:35:44.308 --> 01:35:53.374]  We were able to predict what they were going to do very accurately, but they had a couple different battle plans going in the same direction.
[01:35:53.374 --> 01:36:00.359]  And I personally, because they hadn't been moving too fast before, thought they would do a placebo vaccine.
[01:36:02.228 --> 01:36:06.832]  And that they wouldn't start the real calling till later.
[01:36:06.832 --> 01:36:16.259]  But because they're so far behind, and I said this is the other possible path last year, is that this will make you really sick, like all the scientists are saying.
[01:36:16.259 --> 01:36:21.302]  I just had trouble believing it, it was so shocking.
[01:36:21.302 --> 01:36:26.827]  That then they will say the unvaccinated are the reason that all the vaccinated are dying.
[01:36:26.827 --> 01:36:29.729]  And so they went with that plan.
[01:36:30.828 --> 01:36:32.890]  They had several others.
[01:36:32.890 --> 01:36:41.398]  And so a lot of this is because the top Rothschilds have died.
[01:36:41.398 --> 01:36:43.420]  The top Rockefellers have died.
[01:36:44.750 --> 01:37:00.298]  And I know a lot of people that know the top people, and I mean, they are just involved in torturing and murdering people and devil worshipping and eating vats of feces and chopping their genitals off and torturing themselves.
[01:37:00.298 --> 01:37:01.599]  Folks, I'm not joking around, okay?
[01:37:01.599 --> 01:37:02.300]  This is not a joke.
[01:37:02.300 --> 01:37:03.740]  I'm not just saying this for shock value.
[01:37:03.740 --> 01:37:06.022]  I think people have learned that by now.
[01:37:06.022 --> 01:37:12.765]  I told you all over the world, psychologists and psychiatrists at CPS place children with pedophiles in rape rooms worldwide.
[01:37:12.765 --> 01:37:13.786]  Now it's all over the news, okay?
[01:37:14.694 --> 01:37:17.415]  We're not making this up.
[01:37:17.415 --> 01:37:27.940]  In fact, I ran into some stuff last night doing research, which I already knew they were up to, but it's just, it's so horrible.
[01:37:27.940 --> 01:37:29.741]  God.
[01:37:29.741 --> 01:37:32.222]  Sorry.
[01:37:32.222 --> 01:37:36.164]  Look, believe me, if you think I've gone there on how bad these guys are, you have no idea.
[01:37:39.039 --> 01:37:55.232]  Whether it's the DuPonts or whether it's the Rockefellers or whether it is the Vanderbilts, they are genetically completely turned over to hurting life.
[01:37:55.232 --> 01:37:57.294]  When you see Anderson Cooper, you have to understand,
[01:37:58.652 --> 01:38:01.953]  He looks like a wraith since he was 20 for a reason.
[01:38:01.953 --> 01:38:05.494]  His full will is compromised by the dark side.
[01:38:05.494 --> 01:38:08.215]  And he has one thing.
[01:38:08.215 --> 01:38:12.957]  Hurt people, hurt innocents, suck energy, destroy.
[01:38:12.957 --> 01:38:15.577]  Just like Bill Gates.
[01:38:15.577 --> 01:38:18.939]  And I'm digressing though.
[01:38:18.939 --> 01:38:23.800]  See, I start looking into their mindset and go down that rabbit trail.
[01:38:23.800 --> 01:38:26.181]  But these are predators from hell.
[01:38:27.321 --> 01:38:32.463]  Imagine them as like tentacles reaching in from another dimension, trying to drag you in with them.
[01:38:32.463 --> 01:38:34.824]  That's it.
[01:38:34.824 --> 01:38:41.867]  And so, when you understand that, you understand that everything they are is betrayal.
[01:38:41.867 --> 01:38:43.848]  Everything they are is lies.
[01:38:43.848 --> 01:38:48.490]  Everything they are is inversion, because that is their God.
[01:38:48.490 --> 01:38:52.311]  They have purified themselves.
[01:38:52.311 --> 01:38:53.932]  They have sanctified themselves.
[01:38:55.948 --> 01:38:59.271]  In their satanic religion.
[01:38:59.271 --> 01:39:00.793]  And I'm glad the public's getting this.
[01:39:00.793 --> 01:39:07.940]  You know, last night Tucker Carlson came out and said, you know, the operating system of Democrats really is satanism.
[01:39:11.813 --> 01:39:13.615]  And he got a lot of criticism for that.
[01:39:13.615 --> 01:39:15.616]  But actually, next segment I'll hit that.
[01:39:15.616 --> 01:39:17.097]  That's important.
[01:39:17.097 --> 01:39:19.099]  But they had a movie came out a few years ago.
[01:39:19.099 --> 01:39:19.960]  I went and saw it.
[01:39:19.960 --> 01:39:21.661]  That was the Alamo Draft House in Austin.
[01:39:21.661 --> 01:39:25.704]  Movie theater packed with the liberals celebrating, saying, hell, Satan, you name it.
[01:39:25.704 --> 01:39:29.508]  And the whole show is how the Democratic Party sees Republicans as Christians.
[01:39:29.508 --> 01:39:32.070]  So they've adopted Satanism as their religion.
[01:39:32.070 --> 01:39:33.931]  And they go, oh, we don't really believe in Satan.
[01:39:33.931 --> 01:39:35.633]  Just get involved in our group.
[01:39:35.633 --> 01:39:38.475]  But then it gets deeper into the movie and they really are Satanist.
[01:39:41.809 --> 01:39:47.572]  And so, that's what this whole thing is.
[01:39:47.572 --> 01:39:50.713]  And it's not a game.
[01:39:50.713 --> 01:39:56.356]  And once you turn yourself over to it, it takes you over.
[01:39:56.356 --> 01:40:02.338]  You can use the analogy of a ringwraith stabbing you with its poison blade and tip breaks off.
[01:40:02.338 --> 01:40:07.301]  If you don't get that tip out of you, it's gonna take you over, it's gonna kill you, it's gonna take your soul.
[01:40:08.203 --> 01:40:11.884]  And this is all about taking your will, because you may not respect yourself.
[01:40:11.884 --> 01:40:13.745]  You may not think you're an amazing creature.
[01:40:13.745 --> 01:40:15.585]  You may not think you're an incredible artist.
[01:40:15.585 --> 01:40:17.766]  You may not think your soul's beautiful.
[01:40:17.766 --> 01:40:18.726]  God made you.
[01:40:18.726 --> 01:40:20.947]  God thinks you're incredible.
[01:40:20.947 --> 01:40:22.848]  And you're quite a prize.
[01:40:22.848 --> 01:40:25.488]  The fact that you can see the beauty of a sunset.
[01:40:25.488 --> 01:40:28.809]  You know, my mother, I told this story 20 years ago.
[01:40:28.809 --> 01:40:30.490]  I told it again just last year.
[01:40:30.490 --> 01:40:33.771]  My mother said, you look at the sunset,
[01:40:35.442 --> 01:40:50.636]  And you look at the water, and the waves, and the beach, and you know it's beautiful, and you know it's good, and you commune with it, and you spiritually connect through God's creation to God, and that is a form of worship electromagnetically and spiritually to God.
[01:40:50.636 --> 01:40:55.260]  And God made us to experience this with Him.
[01:40:55.260 --> 01:40:59.204]  And what do they come out and say in Canada, in Australia, New Zealand?
[01:40:59.204 --> 01:41:01.666]  Do not look at the sunset!
[01:41:04.428 --> 01:41:19.002]  Well, statistically, if you look in the morning and at night, when it's low on the horizon, so it's not bad for your eyes, it's been known to massively boost your IQ long-term, to cure depression, you name it.
[01:41:19.002 --> 01:41:20.944]  Sungazing.
[01:41:20.944 --> 01:41:27.170]  Don't look at it once it's up high at all, but come out right when it's on the horizon, through the filter of the dust.
[01:41:27.170 --> 01:41:28.892]  That light just does something in your brain.
[01:41:30.762 --> 01:41:35.905]  And it's all these things God gave us they're trying to take away because these are Satanists.
[01:41:35.905 --> 01:41:41.388]  Do you think these Satanists go at dawn and dusk and stare at the sun?
[01:41:41.388 --> 01:41:43.209]  No, they don't.
[01:41:43.209 --> 01:41:46.370]  You think they like what God put up there?
[01:41:46.370 --> 01:41:47.771]  We don't worship the sun.
[01:41:47.771 --> 01:41:49.352]  It gives us all the life.
[01:41:49.352 --> 01:41:51.953]  God gave it to us.
[01:41:51.953 --> 01:41:54.015]  And it is an archetype of God.
[01:41:54.015 --> 01:41:56.216]  An archetype of his son.
[01:41:56.216 --> 01:41:56.976]  The ancients knew this.
[01:41:56.976 --> 01:41:58.297]  The Egyptians knew it.
[01:41:58.297 --> 01:41:59.077]  S-U-N-S-O-N.
[01:42:04.921 --> 01:42:08.243]  So, ladies and gentlemen, it's just that simple.
[01:42:08.243 --> 01:42:19.992]  All the studies show if you go out with barefoot on the grass, or you walk through the woods for just 10 minutes, depression's gone, and everything the enemy does is to take us out of that and take us away.
[01:42:19.992 --> 01:42:22.273]  That's the perfect way to look at the sun right there.
[01:42:22.273 --> 01:42:24.035]  That's what I do whenever I have the time.
[01:42:24.035 --> 01:42:29.018]  Anytime I'm upset or tired or really shook up, make sure I get up early, go out.
[01:42:29.018 --> 01:42:34.422]  There's a green belt behind my house, and I mean 10 minutes in the sun, oh my God, I am just totally connected to God.
[01:42:35.930 --> 01:42:37.051]  You want to have a vision?
[01:42:37.051 --> 01:42:39.092]  Go do it.
[01:42:39.092 --> 01:42:41.173]  Because you're designed to do that.
[01:42:41.173 --> 01:42:42.754]  That's what all the other animals do when it comes up.
[01:42:42.754 --> 01:42:45.456]  They all come out and sit under it and look at it.
[01:42:45.456 --> 01:42:46.896]  They all celebrate it.
[01:42:46.896 --> 01:42:48.597]  We're all together.
[01:42:48.597 --> 01:42:50.218]  We're all connected to the whole universe, God gave us.
[01:42:50.218 --> 01:42:51.719]  We are with God.
[01:42:51.719 --> 01:42:57.803]  The enemy will never take that away from us, you murderers, you criminal scum, and you will pay for what you've done to our children.
[01:42:58.945 --> 01:43:00.526]  Gerald in South Carolina.
[01:43:00.526 --> 01:43:01.286]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[01:43:01.286 --> 01:43:02.026]  Trying to move quicker.
[01:43:02.026 --> 01:43:02.846]  Hey, Alex.
[01:43:02.846 --> 01:43:03.306]  Welcome.
[01:43:03.306 --> 01:43:08.448]  Would like to say, first off, thanks for being the voice of reason in amongst all this stupidity.
[01:43:08.448 --> 01:43:11.809]  Wanted to warn people, I've been trying to get a hold of you for a year, okay?
[01:43:11.809 --> 01:43:18.292]  I'm a double amputee, and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away.
[01:43:18.292 --> 01:43:19.952]  Living Defense saved my life.
[01:43:19.952 --> 01:43:24.113]  They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me.
[01:43:24.113 --> 01:43:25.554]  Living Defense brought me back.
[01:43:25.834 --> 01:43:31.355]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible Jesus is saying as to where we are right now.
[01:43:31.355 --> 01:43:33.776]  This is Matthew 24 verse 9.
[01:43:33.776 --> 01:43:43.058]  Then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.
[01:43:43.058 --> 01:43:48.499]  And then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another.
[01:43:48.499 --> 01:43:50.019]  That's right where we're at, brother.
[01:43:50.239 --> 01:43:54.341]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country, no matter what they say.
[01:43:54.341 --> 01:43:59.402]  And that's why the enemy hates it, because God created this country.
[01:43:59.402 --> 01:44:03.224]  So when I first started taking survival shield, basically I was 275 pounds.
[01:44:03.224 --> 01:44:04.404]  I was overweight.
[01:44:04.404 --> 01:44:06.725]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe.
[01:44:06.725 --> 01:44:08.666]  I was barely holding on to a job.
[01:44:08.666 --> 01:44:11.147]  And I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it.
[01:44:11.147 --> 01:44:14.608]  So the first one I got was the original survival shield, the X1, and it worked
[01:44:15.128 --> 01:44:15.688]  Pretty good.
[01:44:15.688 --> 01:44:17.729]  And then, shortly thereafter, you came out with X2.
[01:44:17.729 --> 01:44:21.732]  You had, you know, with a deep root source, you know, and I got really excited about that, so I took it.
[01:44:21.732 --> 01:44:28.435]  And man, in two weeks, I went from brain fog to, like, literally, like, my brain was enlightened, you know?
[01:44:28.435 --> 01:44:29.496]  I could think again.
[01:44:29.496 --> 01:44:31.197]  I could connect with people again.
[01:44:31.317 --> 01:44:37.682]  And over the course of the next couple of years, I got my health back, and I religiously take basically all of your supplements.
[01:44:37.682 --> 01:44:40.063]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[01:44:40.063 --> 01:44:41.965]  The one I like recently is Knockout.
[01:44:41.965 --> 01:44:44.186]  It literally, like, if you want to sleep, just take it.
[01:44:44.186 --> 01:44:44.927]  It's amazing.
[01:44:44.927 --> 01:44:45.447]  It works.
[01:44:45.447 --> 01:44:47.989]  But anyway, so the point is, we have to get ourselves clean.
[01:44:47.989 --> 01:44:54.193]  We have to break free of the globalist system, and the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hands.
[01:44:54.193 --> 01:44:55.274]  Beautifully said, brother.
[01:44:55.274 --> 01:44:57.376]  I thank you so much for your call, and Godspeed.
[01:45:00.538 --> 01:45:06.204]  Let's go back in time, say to the mid-1990s, and then imagine a science fiction movie set in the year 2020.
[01:45:07.463 --> 01:45:24.237]  Where a world government's being established, where members of Congress and former presidents are censured by big tech, and where if you don't take an experimental injection that grows blood clots and prions all over your body, then you're not allowed to fly on an airplane.
[01:45:24.237 --> 01:45:26.559]  Think about that, because that's where we are.
[01:45:26.559 --> 01:45:32.484]  Imagine just 20, 30 years ago, hell, just 5 years ago, if somebody told you this would be happening.
[01:45:33.294 --> 01:45:35.375]  But it is happening now.
[01:45:35.375 --> 01:45:41.916]  And then they tell you, oh sorry, it's not a vaccine, it's a gene therapy, and it doesn't really work, so you gotta take it every few months.
[01:45:41.916 --> 01:45:44.477]  And the people that have submitted say, great!
[01:45:44.477 --> 01:45:48.198]  I wanna take it all the time so I can go outside and not get sick from COVID.
[01:45:48.198 --> 01:45:49.898]  Even though it gets you sick from COVID.
[01:45:49.898 --> 01:45:54.480]  And now there's record numbers of really sick people from the sloughing, the shedding of the virus.
[01:45:54.480 --> 01:45:56.660]  And that's in mainline studies.
[01:45:56.660 --> 01:45:58.361]  Bill Gates and Fauci did this.
[01:45:58.361 --> 01:45:59.661]  Need to go to prison for it right now.
[01:46:00.660 --> 01:46:04.401]  Not all vitamin and mineral supplements are equal.
[01:46:04.401 --> 01:46:05.501]  Many of them are synthetic.
[01:46:05.501 --> 01:46:07.462]  Many of them have fillers and additives.
[01:46:07.462 --> 01:46:10.463]  Many of them just pass right through the body and are not absorbed.
[01:46:10.463 --> 01:46:19.365]  Well, that's not the case with our incredibly popular, because it's so effective, product that has now been sold out for months, but is finally back in stock.
[01:46:19.365 --> 01:46:21.846]  And that is Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[01:46:21.846 --> 01:46:24.487]  All the essential vitamins, all the essential minerals,
[01:46:24.847 --> 01:46:28.970]  A bunch of key amino acids to help it upload better into your body and your cells.
[01:46:28.970 --> 01:46:29.951]  It's in powder form.
[01:46:29.951 --> 01:46:31.112]  It's great for children.
[01:46:31.112 --> 01:46:32.053]  It's great for adults.
[01:46:32.053 --> 01:46:36.836]  It's really important for folks that are older, because they don't absorb as well through their guts.
[01:46:36.836 --> 01:46:39.078]  This liquid formula really, really does.
[01:46:39.078 --> 01:46:44.362]  You can mix up a pitcher of it every couple days, put it in the refrigerator, or keep it out in the kitchen.
[01:46:44.362 --> 01:46:46.764]  And just remember to drink it in the morning and in the evening.
[01:46:46.764 --> 01:46:47.805]  It tastes great.
[01:46:47.805 --> 01:46:49.126]  It makes your body healthy.
[01:46:49.126 --> 01:46:50.827]  It boosts your immune system.
[01:46:50.827 --> 01:46:53.369]  And it funds the InfoWAR, a true
[01:46:53.729 --> 01:46:55.171]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:47:25.487 --> 01:47:27.948]  You know, I want to do a human ritual with our listeners.
[01:47:27.948 --> 01:47:29.828]  I just thought of this during the break.
[01:47:29.828 --> 01:47:31.989]  I'll talk about it at the end of the show today.
[01:47:31.989 --> 01:47:49.793]  But I want everybody to pledge tonight and tomorrow night and the next night, because depending on where you are, the sun may not be clear in the sky, to only for like five minutes, right as it's setting, you know, the safe time to do it, to join me in
[01:47:51.567 --> 01:47:56.610]  Gazing at God's incredible creation that gives us life and a celebration of life and to thank God.
[01:47:56.610 --> 01:48:01.993]  And the media will spit it and say it's an occult ritual because that's the opposite.
[01:48:01.993 --> 01:48:06.275]  They're telling us don't go look at the sunset, don't look at the sunrise.
[01:48:06.275 --> 01:48:18.162]  And I would like to pledge to the listeners that at sundown central, it doesn't matter where you are in the world, at your sundown,
[01:48:20.216 --> 01:48:32.841]  That you go out for five minutes and just pray to God for a global awakening and pray to God for healing and pray to God to send light and love and good energy into the world to give people courage to stand up and do the right thing.
[01:48:32.841 --> 01:48:41.925]  Because especially in Northern Europe, they found massive suicides in studies in the 60s and 70s and 80s.
[01:48:41.925 --> 01:48:48.648]  And so they started putting in artificial sunlights, they started putting in special white walls and the suicide stopped.
[01:48:49.916 --> 01:49:00.843]  And again, it's a certain type of sunlight, especially at dusk and dawn, that directly into the eyes does something to the cones and rods in the eyes that does something to the brain.
[01:49:00.843 --> 01:49:03.844]  And it's real.
[01:49:03.844 --> 01:49:06.266]  Sun creates almost all life on Earth, 99% of it.
[01:49:08.685 --> 01:49:13.427]  And so, they don't want us doing this because it's better than television.
[01:49:13.427 --> 01:49:15.528]  It's better than going to the movies.
[01:49:15.528 --> 01:49:19.449]  Hey, make a fire if you've got a fireplace outside.
[01:49:19.449 --> 01:49:20.370]  Go sit around that.
[01:49:20.370 --> 01:49:24.571]  I mean, it's simple stuff I'm saying, see?
[01:49:24.571 --> 01:49:25.632]  This is not rocket science.
[01:49:26.781 --> 01:49:27.982]  Spend time with your family.
[01:49:27.982 --> 01:49:28.723]  Love yourself.
[01:49:28.723 --> 01:49:29.944]  Love God.
[01:49:29.944 --> 01:49:31.105]  Don't let them put you down.
[01:49:31.105 --> 01:49:32.366]  Don't make them think you're ugly.
[01:49:32.366 --> 01:49:34.247]  Don't make them think you're a failure.
[01:49:34.247 --> 01:49:36.349]  Don't make them think you're a nobody.
[01:49:36.349 --> 01:49:38.250]  This whole worldly system is such a lie.
[01:49:38.250 --> 01:49:39.391]  You were made by God.
[01:49:39.391 --> 01:49:41.853]  And you know the truth.
[01:49:41.853 --> 01:49:47.598]  And knowing the truth and having that connection to truth is everything.
[01:49:47.598 --> 01:49:49.319]  Bill Gates is the poorest man in the world.
[01:49:50.219 --> 01:49:59.785]  Those of you that know God and know justice and have the satisfaction and the commitment and the feeling of beyond satisfaction.
[01:49:59.785 --> 01:50:01.946]  The word is completion.
[01:50:01.946 --> 01:50:03.547]  The word is peace.
[01:50:03.547 --> 01:50:05.688]  And we need that.
[01:50:05.688 --> 01:50:07.670]  And we need the forest.
[01:50:07.670 --> 01:50:08.950]  And we need the ocean.
[01:50:08.950 --> 01:50:10.451]  And we need the birds.
[01:50:10.451 --> 01:50:11.232]  We need the bees.
[01:50:11.232 --> 01:50:11.992]  And we need the sun.
[01:50:11.992 --> 01:50:13.093]  And we need the moon.
[01:50:13.093 --> 01:50:14.834]  And we need the stars.
[01:50:14.834 --> 01:50:19.797]  To realize that these little ugly monsters that seek to play God are going to be our testers.
[01:50:21.235 --> 01:50:23.657]  But they will be removed.
[01:50:23.657 --> 01:50:25.738]  They're the losers.
[01:50:25.738 --> 01:50:29.161]  They're the village idiots.
[01:50:29.161 --> 01:50:31.262]  Now let's talk about solutions.
[01:50:31.262 --> 01:50:42.450]  The Australian Prime Minister that poses as a Conservative acts like it's up to the regional governors, the premiers, to do what they want, but he's let them do the worst global control
[01:50:43.581 --> 01:50:44.642]  The planet's ever seen.
[01:50:44.642 --> 01:50:46.983]  I mean, this is beyond North Korea.
[01:50:46.983 --> 01:50:48.885]  This is beyond East Germany.
[01:50:48.885 --> 01:50:52.287]  This is beyond, and it's just, it's horrible.
[01:50:52.287 --> 01:50:53.268]  It's super abusive.
[01:50:53.268 --> 01:50:54.949]  It's beyond evil.
[01:50:54.949 --> 01:51:05.217]  And now he came out after he saw riots all over the country that overran the police, overran everything, because he knows the Aussies are going to start burning stuff down.
[01:51:05.217 --> 01:51:08.879]  And so he's like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, let's stop now.
[01:51:08.879 --> 01:51:10.721]  We'll have to accept one or two cases.
[01:51:11.886 --> 01:51:13.487]  Imagine one or two cases.
[01:51:13.487 --> 01:51:16.529]  They're just suppressing that their cases are in the country.
[01:51:16.529 --> 01:51:20.932]  I mean, police running people over, people, police stomping on people's heads.
[01:51:20.932 --> 01:51:27.536]  I mean, the Australian police are just a absolute menace.
[01:51:27.536 --> 01:51:30.397]  We don't see the left complaining about that.
[01:51:30.397 --> 01:51:38.022]  So just a week ago, their leader was saying, the lockdowns continue until 70% of you take this deadly shot, but it's your right not to take it.
[01:51:38.022 --> 01:51:39.583]  But now because the people are resisting,
[01:51:40.725 --> 01:51:43.948]  Well, you see what's happening.
[01:51:43.948 --> 01:51:49.011]  And because they understand that finally the public's finding its will, they're backing down.
[01:51:49.011 --> 01:51:49.972]  Same thing in the UK.
[01:51:49.972 --> 01:51:52.955]  They're now taking over TV stations peacefully.
[01:51:52.955 --> 01:51:54.216]  We're trying to take our lives over.
[01:51:54.216 --> 01:51:55.416]  We're trying to take our bodies over.
[01:51:55.416 --> 01:51:56.838]  Trying to violate the Nuremberg Code.
[01:51:56.838 --> 01:51:58.379]  Trying to put something deadly in us.
[01:51:58.379 --> 01:51:59.520]  I mean, what do you want us to do?
[01:52:02.056 --> 01:52:13.358]  When you're pepper spraying people's children and stuff, you think the good guys that don't want power and don't want violence, you think when you beat our kids up and our wives up and our fathers and brothers up, you think it makes us go away?
[01:52:13.358 --> 01:52:18.439]  No, it makes us think about what we're going to do to you and we will do something, don't you worry about it.
[01:52:18.439 --> 01:52:20.280]  Or when you're like, good, we'll call you terrorists.
[01:52:20.280 --> 01:52:20.740]  Oh really?
[01:52:20.740 --> 01:52:22.960]  You'll just get the whole party going, won't you?
[01:52:22.960 --> 01:52:24.640]  You can't even hold Afghanistan.
[01:52:24.640 --> 01:52:27.521]  You can't run your blue cities full of feces and fentanyl.
[01:52:28.570 --> 01:52:33.035]  All you can do is murder us all day and sit around and slap yourselves on the back.
[01:52:33.035 --> 01:52:36.779]  But I see the videos of Nancy Pelosi's parties and Barack Obama's parties.
[01:52:36.779 --> 01:52:44.128]  It looks like a bunch of trash and a bunch of unhappy garbage that all know they're losers and all know they're jokes.
[01:52:44.128 --> 01:52:48.613]  All a bunch of posing fakes that signed on the wrong side of the universe.
[01:52:52.196 --> 01:52:54.098]  Powerful video coming up.
[01:52:54.098 --> 01:52:55.840]  It's on InfoWars.com.
[01:52:55.840 --> 01:53:01.565]  Los Angeles Fire Department Captain under investigation for video slamming COVID vaccine tyranny.
[01:53:01.565 --> 01:53:02.206]  Well, you know what?
[01:53:02.206 --> 01:53:04.348]  You're under investigation for tyranny.
[01:53:04.348 --> 01:53:08.112]  You're under investigation for pushing a depopulation weapon on us globalists.
[01:53:08.112 --> 01:53:10.755]  You're under investigation for trying to censor us.
[01:53:10.755 --> 01:53:12.777]  You're under investigation, New World Order!
[01:53:14.355 --> 01:53:24.233]  I ain't got all your ten badges in your Justice Department crap, but I got justice and freedom and human history on my side, and the tyrants are zero, and humanity's batting a thousand.
[01:53:26.957 --> 01:53:28.618]  Let's talk about this because I mentioned it.
[01:53:28.618 --> 01:53:34.523]  Here's Tucker Carlson last night talking about Satanism being the Democratic Party's operating system.
[01:53:34.523 --> 01:53:39.066]  They say that in the high-budget film, Hail Satan!
[01:53:39.066 --> 01:53:43.890]  They go all over the country and show the Democrats saying they're Satanists and huge parties and that is who they are.
[01:53:43.890 --> 01:53:44.630]  I've been around them.
[01:53:44.630 --> 01:53:46.211]  I've seen it.
[01:53:46.211 --> 01:53:48.493]  So here it is.
[01:53:48.493 --> 01:53:49.734]  ...and destroying this country.
[01:53:51.677 --> 01:53:56.959]  What do you think, I've always wondered this, like what is the actual support for the ideas?
[01:53:56.959 --> 01:54:02.001]  Not, you know, do you like Trump or Biden, but for example, do you think men can get pregnant?
[01:54:02.001 --> 01:54:05.843]  Or do you think some races are morally superior to other races?
[01:54:05.843 --> 01:54:07.784]  Like the core idea is the Democratic Party.
[01:54:07.784 --> 01:54:10.445]  How many Americans actually believe that stuff, would you guess?
[01:54:12.685 --> 01:54:17.426]  I don't think 5% of America believes it, maybe.
[01:54:17.426 --> 01:54:18.607]  10%?
[01:54:18.607 --> 01:54:19.967]  I don't know.
[01:54:19.967 --> 01:54:26.309]  Tucker, I'm going to say something difficult to unpack in this short amount of time, but it's what I truly believe.
[01:54:26.309 --> 01:54:29.350]  I think a lot of what the left supports is satanic.
[01:54:29.350 --> 01:54:30.550]  I'm just sorry.
[01:54:30.550 --> 01:54:34.211]  It's in direct objection to God.
[01:54:34.731 --> 01:54:49.576]  And in direct objection to the Judeo-Christian values that were at the foundation of this country and those Christian values are why we made so much progress in terms of freedom and humanity and the way we treat everybody.
[01:54:49.576 --> 01:54:50.737]  Yes, it was hard.
[01:54:51.317 --> 01:55:01.991]  But our Christian values compelled us to sacrifice our lives for the freedoms of other Americans, of slaves, and through the civil rights movement.
[01:55:01.991 --> 01:55:09.020]  Our Christian values compelled us to take risks and fight for equality and the equality of opportunity for everybody.
[01:55:09.982 --> 01:55:13.628]  I just, I see a lot of what's going on here.
[01:55:13.628 --> 01:55:15.131]  I'm just sorry.
[01:55:15.131 --> 01:55:16.433]  I'm a man of faith.
[01:55:16.433 --> 01:55:18.157]  I was raised in the church.
[01:55:18.157 --> 01:55:19.579]  This stuff is satanic.
[01:55:19.579 --> 01:55:21.984]  That's what's at the foundation of a lot of this stuff.
[01:55:22.927 --> 01:55:23.507]  That's right.
[01:55:23.507 --> 01:55:27.168]  Well, I'm a pretty mild Protestant, personally, but I completely agree with you.
[01:55:27.168 --> 01:55:28.128]  Especially the gender stuff.
[01:55:28.128 --> 01:55:32.649]  When you say you can change your own gender by wishing it, you're saying you're God.
[01:55:32.649 --> 01:55:33.769]  And that is satanic.
[01:55:33.769 --> 01:55:35.130]  I completely agree.
[01:55:35.130 --> 01:55:37.490]  That's right.
[01:55:37.490 --> 01:55:43.752]  But it's all about gaslighting us where they say what they want, when they want, and they make us accept it.
[01:55:43.752 --> 01:55:49.333]  And Bathelmette is, doing the whole deal, is bigendered.
[01:55:50.495 --> 01:55:54.017]  So that's what this whole thing is, is Satanism.
[01:55:54.017 --> 01:55:56.139]  That's why Mel Gibson did a great job in Passion of the Christ.
[01:55:56.139 --> 01:56:00.722]  You notice the devil in that is Aphrodite.
[01:56:00.722 --> 01:56:02.183]  So, powerful information.
[01:56:02.183 --> 01:56:04.024]  You'll see the film Hell's Satan.
[01:56:04.024 --> 01:56:06.725]  I mean, the whole thing is the Democratic Party are now Satanists.
[01:56:06.725 --> 01:56:12.749]  And you go out to their events, undercover, they talk about how much they love Satan and all of it.
[01:56:12.749 --> 01:56:16.452]  And they're really just a bunch of really soft, weird nerds.
[01:56:17.877 --> 01:56:23.158]  Uh, that, that, that no Satan rules the planet and they just want some petty power.
[01:56:23.158 --> 01:56:25.659]  And then they also make jokes about, oh, it doesn't exist.
[01:56:25.659 --> 01:56:29.999]  There's not really Satanism, but then that's how they suck everybody into it to control them.
[01:56:29.999 --> 01:56:30.219]  Yeah.
[01:56:30.219 --> 01:56:36.301]  Owen goes out to the, uh, abortion rallies and they literally, the majority of them are, I want to kill babies.
[01:56:36.301 --> 01:56:38.261]  I love Satan.
[01:56:38.261 --> 01:56:40.241]  And they're, they're just demonic.
[01:56:40.241 --> 01:56:42.822]  The women act like rabid dogs or something.
[01:56:43.479 --> 01:56:44.601]  And this is what they've been turned into.
[01:56:44.601 --> 01:56:45.261]  They don't love men.
[01:56:45.261 --> 01:56:45.882]  They don't love women.
[01:56:45.882 --> 01:56:46.383]  They love nobody.
[01:56:46.383 --> 01:56:49.247]  They just run around saying, Satan, Satan, kill, kill.
[01:56:49.247 --> 01:56:51.490]  We're going to come back with our special guest.
[01:56:51.490 --> 01:56:54.434]  This video went super, super ultra viral.
[01:56:54.434 --> 01:56:57.178]  And by the way, that video is up on Band.Video.
[01:56:57.178 --> 01:57:00.662]  I hope that you share the video by Dr. Sean M. Brooks.

[01:57:37.086 --> 01:57:38.707]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:57:38.707 --> 01:57:40.888]  And that's how we fund this operation.
[01:57:40.888 --> 01:57:42.668]  So thanks for keeping us on the air.
[01:57:42.668 --> 01:57:44.789]  And get a t-shirt while you're at it.
[01:57:44.789 --> 01:57:48.831]  We'll be back with our number three.
[01:57:48.831 --> 01:57:52.212]  Humanity is the main stakeholder on this planet.
[01:57:52.935 --> 01:57:53.395]  We're good to go.
[01:58:10.609 --> 01:58:16.996]  Capturing democracy and taking over governments worldwide to set up a corporate dictatorship under the UN.
[01:58:16.996 --> 01:58:19.298]  They admit all of this.
[01:58:19.298 --> 01:58:20.579]  They plan the lockdowns.
[01:58:20.579 --> 01:58:22.261]  They release the viruses.
[01:58:22.261 --> 01:58:23.983]  They think you're stupid.
[01:58:23.983 --> 01:58:30.089]  And their plan is to slowly cut off the resources so they can dictate total social control over you and your lives.
[01:58:30.649 --> 01:58:35.834]  That's how I was able to predict everything they did decades before they executed it.
[01:58:35.834 --> 01:58:41.220]  Word for word with total precision because they have a detailed battle plan.
[01:58:41.220 --> 01:58:42.881]  We cover it live weekdays 11 a.m.
[01:58:42.881 --> 01:58:43.802]  to 3 p.m.
[01:58:43.802 --> 01:58:45.905]  at InfoWars.com.org slash show.
[01:58:45.905 --> 01:58:48.007]  Tell everybody to tune in now and warn the world.
[01:58:50.632 --> 01:58:53.934]  So what's the most important part, let's say, in a bulldozer running over the globalist?
[01:58:53.934 --> 01:58:57.396]  The treads, the wheels, the engine, the scoop on the front.
[01:58:57.396 --> 01:59:00.138]  It's all very important, but the fuel is paramount.
[01:59:00.138 --> 01:59:01.039]  And that's my allegory.
[01:59:02.079 --> 01:59:13.146]  TurboForce is vitamins, minerals, amino acids that synergistically work with six different natural forms of healthy, clean energy that last for 10 hours in the average metabolic system metabolism of a human.
[01:59:13.146 --> 01:59:15.468]  Some people get 15 hours out of it, some people get about 8 hours.
[01:59:15.468 --> 01:59:21.211]  But people take this, people take it in sports, people cannot believe it's the best they've ever had because it's not hype.
[01:59:21.211 --> 01:59:27.435]  Nobody puts as much product into their pre-workouts, their post-workouts, you can call us whatever you want.
[01:59:27.435 --> 01:59:28.856]  It's a total solution.
[01:59:28.856 --> 01:59:30.037]  All around the best you're going to find.
[01:59:30.137 --> 01:59:31.137]  Turbo Force.
[01:59:31.137 --> 01:59:33.398]  Without you, we don't roll.
[01:59:33.398 --> 01:59:35.119]  With you, we surge forward together.
[01:59:35.119 --> 01:59:37.140]  It's like the bulldozer without the diesel fuel.
[01:59:37.140 --> 01:59:39.761]  If we don't have your financial support, we will be defeated.
[01:59:39.761 --> 01:59:42.802]  You support us and get products you already need that literally fuel your body and your mind?
[01:59:42.802 --> 01:59:43.803]  It's a win-win.
[01:59:43.803 --> 01:59:44.343]  360 together.
[01:59:44.343 --> 01:59:45.383]  Infowarsstore.com or AAA253-3139.
[01:59:45.383 --> 01:59:46.704]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:09.434 --> 02:00:14.504]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:20.618 --> 02:00:25.201]  While the mockingbird media implodes over Biden's Afghanistan disaster.
[02:00:25.201 --> 02:00:30.964]  I heard President Biden say yesterday in his comments to ABC News that this is not a failure.
[02:00:30.964 --> 02:00:43.051]  And I think a lot of people outside that airport, particularly those taking the kinds of extreme actions we're just talking about, would like to know, if this isn't failure, what does failure look like exactly?
[02:00:43.051 --> 02:00:45.332]  Mr. Ambassador, thank you for joining me, sir.
[02:00:45.332 --> 02:00:47.894]  You know this territory very well.
[02:00:47.894 --> 02:00:49.675]  Is President Biden right on this?
[02:00:50.686 --> 02:01:00.879]  The question of leaving is one thing, and that's an arguable decision, but the manner of the leaving has been an absolute disaster, totally lacking
[02:01:04.051 --> 02:01:04.531]  Sure.
[02:01:24.162 --> 02:01:33.387]  The dissent memo and these cables now from the Afghan employees at the State Department we've got in the last 24 hours are devastating.
[02:01:33.387 --> 02:01:35.388]  We have destroyed morale.
[02:01:35.388 --> 02:01:42.552]  Those addicted to the lie are dancing in the streets while thousands of Americans are trapped behind enemy lines.
[02:01:42.552 --> 02:01:48.636]  And we're so tribalistic as a country, it's hard for somebody to imagine a Republican saying everybody's responsible.
[02:01:48.636 --> 02:01:52.598]  But let's keep in mind, Mike Pompeo met with the Taliban.
[02:01:53.118 --> 02:01:57.121]  As Donald Trump was publicly saying, we have to get out of Afghanistan at all costs.
[02:01:57.121 --> 02:01:58.101]  It's not worth it.
[02:01:58.101 --> 02:02:02.084]  Mike Pompeo meets with the Taliban and tries to negotiate something.
[02:02:02.084 --> 02:02:10.649]  By the way, they ended up getting enrolled harder than never, almost as bad as Neville Chamberlain, because they knew what the desired outcome of the Trump administration was.
[02:02:10.649 --> 02:02:12.490]  So they set this up to fail.
[02:02:12.910 --> 02:02:30.314]  But those who live by the propaganda will die by the propaganda, as Brian Stelter's wrong-think spectacle flipped the script on the historical disaster clinging to the radical left ideology, supporting the senile Joe Biden no matter what he does.
[02:02:30.314 --> 02:02:36.776]  Biden, quote, has stuck to his guns while under attack in the press, laying out a case for the limits of American military power.
[02:02:37.316 --> 02:02:42.081]  So, Matthew Dowd, you would describe the media's coverage this week as what?
[02:02:42.081 --> 02:02:47.766]  Way over the top and unconnected to a perspective on the issue from the beginning.
[02:02:47.766 --> 02:02:53.851]  They've added more perspective in the final days, but from the beginning they didn't have a perspective on it.
[02:02:53.851 --> 02:02:58.476]  My sense of this is, Joe Biden has done, we should judge it by the data.
[02:02:59.016 --> 02:03:01.458]  Of what's happened and not by anecdotes.
[02:03:01.458 --> 02:03:07.122]  And sometimes the president or the press has a tendency to judge things by anecdotes and not the data.
[02:03:07.122 --> 02:03:15.309]  And the data for the last week shows Joe Biden has basically gotten 30,000 people out of Afghanistan without a single loss of an American life.
[02:03:16.092 --> 02:03:21.939]  I think that we also see why it was so hard for presidents in the past to pull out of Afghanistan.
[02:03:21.939 --> 02:03:25.624]  They were afraid of exactly this kind of press overreaction.
[02:03:25.624 --> 02:03:30.991]  There's no way to surrender, leave, withdraw, whatever you want to call it, in a war
[02:03:32.132 --> 02:03:42.824]  Without things getting ugly, and I feel there was something Pollyanna-ish about expecting anything different, and it disappoints me that the press is behaving in this way.
[02:03:42.824 --> 02:03:50.193]  House Speaker Pelosi, who just held a maskless luncheon in Napa Valley while the servants wore masks,
[02:03:50.613 --> 02:04:03.809]  Laughably praised Biden's undeniable debacle, writing, I want to acknowledge the clarity of purpose of President Biden's statements and the wisdom of his actions.
[02:04:03.809 --> 02:04:09.055]  In the coming weeks and months, these words will come back to haunt all of them.
[02:04:09.055 --> 02:04:10.196]  John Bowne reporting.
[02:04:13.888 --> 02:04:15.710]  By the way, folks, I'm not bragging.
[02:04:15.710 --> 02:04:24.198]  I'm just so proud of all of our reporters and all of our people that file reports, like John Bowne and Greg Reese and everybody else.
[02:04:24.198 --> 02:04:26.840]  I mean, that's three reports that Bowne filed today.
[02:04:26.840 --> 02:04:27.320]  They're all
[02:04:28.291 --> 02:04:30.132]  Absolutely excellent.
[02:04:30.132 --> 02:04:37.738]  And one of the big reports we just followed today deals with Pfizer's whole history of experimental deadly drugs and secret testing.
[02:04:37.738 --> 02:04:41.900]  Now they're the most fined, most indicted company out there.
[02:04:41.900 --> 02:04:46.023]  And that's a very important report dealing with the global rebellion starting against that.
[02:04:46.023 --> 02:04:47.164]  So that's all coming up.
[02:04:47.164 --> 02:04:48.265]  I really wanted to get him on.
[02:04:48.265 --> 02:04:49.325]  The crew got him.
[02:04:49.325 --> 02:04:53.008]  Dr. Sean M. Brooks, PhD, very well spoken.
[02:04:53.008 --> 02:04:54.429]  He's with us straight ahead.
[02:04:54.429 --> 02:04:57.251]  We'll replay what he said at the school board and then we'll go right to him.
[02:05:00.131 --> 02:05:03.873]  Not all vitamin and mineral supplements are equal.
[02:05:03.873 --> 02:05:04.974]  Many of them are synthetic.
[02:05:04.974 --> 02:05:06.935]  Many of them have fillers and additives.
[02:05:06.935 --> 02:05:09.937]  Many of them just pass right through the body and are not absorbed.
[02:05:09.937 --> 02:05:18.843]  Well, that's not the case with our incredibly popular, because it's so effective, product that has now been sold out for months, but it's finally back in stock.
[02:05:18.843 --> 02:05:21.324]  And that is Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[02:05:21.324 --> 02:05:23.966]  All the essential vitamins, all the essential minerals,
[02:05:24.326 --> 02:05:28.448]  A bunch of key amino acids help it upload better into your body and your cells.
[02:05:28.448 --> 02:05:29.388]  It's in powder form.
[02:05:29.388 --> 02:05:30.588]  It's great for children.
[02:05:30.588 --> 02:05:31.509]  It's great for adults.
[02:05:31.509 --> 02:05:36.290]  It's really important for folks that are older because they don't absorb as well through their guts.
[02:05:36.290 --> 02:05:38.551]  This liquid formula really, really does.
[02:05:38.551 --> 02:05:46.234]  You mix up a pitcher of it every couple days, put it in the refrigerator, or keep it out in the kitchen, and just remember to drink it in the morning and in the evening.
[02:05:46.234 --> 02:05:47.274]  It tastes great.
[02:05:47.274 --> 02:05:48.595]  It makes your body healthy.
[02:05:48.595 --> 02:05:51.296]  It boosts your immune system, and it funds
[02:05:51.476 --> 02:05:53.497]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:05:53.497 --> 02:05:57.038]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:06:12.594 --> 02:06:17.738]  Well, we played clips of probably 500 doctors and scientists and nurses or more.
[02:06:17.738 --> 02:06:21.801]  I mean, higher like 10 or 15 a day, sometimes 20, 30 a day.
[02:06:21.801 --> 02:06:25.684]  But... But there was a particular video...
[02:06:26.664 --> 02:06:26.944]  I don't know.
[02:06:46.932 --> 02:06:47.213]  I think so.
[02:07:04.741 --> 02:07:11.068]  It doesn't matter if you're a school teacher, it doesn't matter if you're an auto mechanic, it doesn't matter if you're a mother whose son took the vaccine and died.
[02:07:11.068 --> 02:07:12.930]  That stuff's happening out of young people.
[02:07:12.930 --> 02:07:14.531]  All of you should go be heard.
[02:07:14.531 --> 02:07:18.275]  All of you should speak out because the system doesn't want you to be heard.
[02:07:18.275 --> 02:07:21.359]  But our guest, when we producer got him on the phone yesterday, wanted to talk to me.
[02:07:21.359 --> 02:07:23.020]  He said, listen, I want to clear something up.
[02:07:24.081 --> 02:07:32.345]  I went to that high school, and I was there, and I'm a well-known PhD in education, and when you're there, you say what town you live in, it's Oxford.
[02:07:32.345 --> 02:07:36.127]  I'm not a doctor from Oxford, because the internet had been saying that, so that's cleared up.
[02:07:36.127 --> 02:07:37.748]  But, you still want me on?
[02:07:37.748 --> 02:07:50.194]  I said, yeah, now that I know who you are, I've seen your writings before, and I've heard about some of your books, I really want you on the show because you're an articulate person, and it doesn't matter if you're a PhD in education, or a medical doctor, or a school teacher, or a
[02:07:50.974 --> 02:07:54.775]  As I said, some guy that, you know, trims people's bushes for a living.
[02:07:54.775 --> 02:07:58.536]  We're all humans and can observe what's going on and speak out.
[02:07:58.536 --> 02:08:00.496]  But I love the viral video.
[02:08:00.496 --> 02:08:01.996]  It's very to the point.
[02:08:01.996 --> 02:08:03.017]  It's warning people.
[02:08:03.017 --> 02:08:03.977]  It's what they need to hear.
[02:08:03.977 --> 02:08:09.398]  So here's what you had to say to the school board, your alma mater, and we'll come back to you for the next hour and 30 minutes or so.
[02:08:09.398 --> 02:08:12.018]  And then Owen Shroyer is going to be joining us as well.
[02:08:12.018 --> 02:08:14.359]  But Dr. Sean M. Brooks, PhD, is here.
[02:08:14.359 --> 02:08:16.799]  AmericanEducationFM.com.
[02:08:16.799 --> 02:08:18.620]  But here's what he had to say in the viral video.
[02:08:22.841 --> 02:08:30.446]  For the next person.
[02:08:30.446 --> 02:08:32.467]  My brother.
[02:08:32.467 --> 02:08:34.448]  Disappointed.
[02:08:34.448 --> 02:08:38.331]  My name is Dr. Sean Brooks, PhD.
[02:08:38.331 --> 02:08:40.072]  Oxford.
[02:08:40.072 --> 02:08:43.134]  I have 48 publications, including 23 books.
[02:08:43.134 --> 02:08:46.335]  I've studied health medicine, anatomy, and physiology for approximately 21 years.
[02:08:48.203 --> 02:08:57.710]  Dr. Robert Malone who created the messenger RNA vaccine has said no one should ever take these jabs ever under any circumstance whatsoever.
[02:08:57.710 --> 02:09:00.832]  He created it and he says don't ever do it.
[02:09:00.832 --> 02:09:05.075]  So let me explain what's going to happen to the people who have taken it.
[02:09:05.075 --> 02:09:10.819]  The people who have taken it are going to die in the next six months to three to five years for three reasons.
[02:09:12.418 --> 02:09:16.122]  You've dramatically decreased your own immune system by 35%.
[02:09:16.122 --> 02:09:19.807]  The first jab did it by at least 15.
[02:09:19.807 --> 02:09:22.450]  The second did it by 35 now.
[02:09:22.450 --> 02:09:25.333]  If you take any booster shot, you will die.
[02:09:25.333 --> 02:09:26.574]  That's it.
[02:09:26.574 --> 02:09:30.539]  You take a flu shot in the future, you will die.
[02:09:30.539 --> 02:09:31.300]  The second reason.
[02:09:31.781 --> 02:09:33.722]  Antibody Dependent Enhancement.
[02:09:33.722 --> 02:09:39.044]  Antibody Dependent Enhancement is what is happening with these jabs with everybody who has taken them.
[02:09:39.044 --> 02:09:41.264]  Unless, of course, you've taken a placebo.
[02:09:41.264 --> 02:09:43.385]  But there's no way that you would know that.
[02:09:43.385 --> 02:09:51.988]  So given that fact, Antibody Dependent Enhancement tricks the entire body into believing that the cell that's eating the pathogen is eating it when it isn't.
[02:09:51.988 --> 02:09:56.430]  It ends up leading to what's called a cytokine storm, which causes organ failure.
[02:09:58.083 --> 02:10:00.925]  That will cause your death, and there's no stopping that.
[02:10:00.925 --> 02:10:02.966]  No amount of drugs will stop that.
[02:10:02.966 --> 02:10:05.868]  The third thing, blood clotting.
[02:10:05.868 --> 02:10:08.530]  Everyone who has taken the jabs is blood clotting.
[02:10:08.530 --> 02:10:11.492]  If you don't believe me, there's a way you can find out.
[02:10:11.492 --> 02:10:14.174]  Take what's called a D-dimer test.
[02:10:14.174 --> 02:10:18.937]  What that does is that detects blood clotting at the microscopic level.
[02:10:19.770 --> 02:10:22.572]  They're cutting full blood clots out of people right now.
[02:10:22.572 --> 02:10:26.035]  As I'm talking to you, millions have died from the jabs.
[02:10:26.035 --> 02:10:32.960]  In your last meeting, you advocated for people to take the jabs potentially in the future, along with wearing masks.
[02:10:32.960 --> 02:10:35.102]  And I heard parents say the same thing.
[02:10:35.102 --> 02:10:41.927]  So to the parents who are actually considering jabbing their own children, you're going to sterilize them permanently.
[02:10:41.927 --> 02:10:44.409]  People who have taken the jabs are sterilized.
[02:10:45.951 --> 02:10:51.473]  80% of women who have been jabbed have lost their children in the first trimester.
[02:10:51.473 --> 02:10:54.274]  You can't have kids!
[02:10:54.274 --> 02:10:57.736]  You've also injected yourself with the equivalent of HIV.
[02:10:57.736 --> 02:11:05.599]  You can now no longer breastfeed, donate blood, donate organs, donate blood plasma, nor bone marrow.
[02:11:05.599 --> 02:11:10.961]  If you don't believe me, try to donate blood and blood plasma and find out what happens.
[02:11:10.961 --> 02:11:12.661]  You will be denied.
[02:11:12.661 --> 02:11:14.262]  Unless, of course, you live in California.
[02:11:15.117 --> 02:11:19.919]  In which case they're allowing people to donate toxic blood with spike proteins in it.
[02:11:19.919 --> 02:11:22.760]  The jabs create spike proteins.
[02:11:22.760 --> 02:11:25.741]  They're in the jabs themselves.
[02:11:25.741 --> 02:11:29.263]  And they create it by snapping your RNA in half.
[02:11:29.263 --> 02:11:31.824]  You are no longer a human anymore.
[02:11:31.824 --> 02:11:34.005]  You are something else.
[02:11:34.005 --> 02:11:37.186]  And you are susceptible to countless diseases.
[02:11:37.186 --> 02:11:39.447]  Now here's what's going to happen in the future very quickly.
[02:11:40.305 --> 02:11:41.666]  You have 15 seconds.
[02:11:41.666 --> 02:11:42.266]  Great.
[02:11:42.266 --> 02:11:46.568]  I don't know what percentage of your staff has taken the jabs, but your school is going to close.
[02:11:46.568 --> 02:11:48.189]  You will not stay open.
[02:11:48.189 --> 02:11:51.650]  You will close because they will fall ill and they will die.
[02:11:51.650 --> 02:11:53.591]  That will happen in all of your buildings.
[02:11:53.591 --> 02:11:55.172]  It's already happening.
[02:11:55.172 --> 02:11:56.233]  Thank you, sir.
[02:11:56.233 --> 02:11:56.933]  I bet it is.
[02:11:56.933 --> 02:11:58.214]  It's already happening.
[02:11:58.214 --> 02:11:59.034]  Good luck.
[02:11:59.034 --> 02:12:00.074]  Nothing can stop this.
[02:12:00.074 --> 02:12:00.515]  Thank you, sir.
[02:12:02.478 --> 02:12:08.160]  All right, so we need to be alarmist about this, because this is the big globalist move, and everything he says you can document.
[02:12:08.160 --> 02:12:10.581]  In fact, he says 80% in the first trimester.
[02:12:10.581 --> 02:12:13.702]  Actually, New England Medical Journal, it's like 83%.
[02:12:13.702 --> 02:12:15.282]  So he's being conservative.
[02:12:15.282 --> 02:12:16.723]  He's a smart guy, well-spoken.
[02:12:16.723 --> 02:12:18.043]  I wanted to get him on.
[02:12:18.043 --> 02:12:21.244]  I appreciate Dr. Sean M. Brooks, Ph.D., coming on at short notice.
[02:12:21.244 --> 02:12:29.187]  Former public school teachers of math, science, health education, anatomy, psychology, and former adjunct university professor, teacher education.
[02:12:29.187 --> 02:12:31.848]  Dr. Brooks is the author of several books on violence and school crime.
[02:12:32.848 --> 02:12:39.192]  You look at health and safety, politics, and teacher effectiveness in American K-12 and higher education.
[02:12:39.192 --> 02:12:44.535]  Dr. Brooks holds a bachelor's in health education at Miami University, a master's, PhD in education from Walden University.
[02:12:44.535 --> 02:12:53.620]  He's written for AmericanThinker.com and Substack, part of the American Classroom, and all of his books are available on Amazon.com, AmericanEducationFM.com.
[02:12:53.620 --> 02:12:54.721]  Got three minutes to break.
[02:12:54.721 --> 02:12:56.962]  Really appreciate you coming on, Doc.
[02:12:56.962 --> 02:12:59.484]  So much to talk about, but what do you want to just say out of the gates?
[02:13:01.226 --> 02:13:02.927]  First of all, thank you for having me on.
[02:13:02.927 --> 02:13:04.547]  I appreciate it.
[02:13:04.547 --> 02:13:07.428]  I haven't taught psychology.
[02:13:07.428 --> 02:13:10.270]  I taught physiology, anatomy and physiology at the high school level.
[02:13:10.270 --> 02:13:16.332]  But again, this is a subject that you study when you're studying with your bachelor's degree.
[02:13:16.332 --> 02:13:17.873]  So yeah, I'm 40 years old.
[02:13:17.873 --> 02:13:22.474]  I've been studying this since I was 18, 19 years old.
[02:13:22.474 --> 02:13:26.456]  I would just encourage people to watch the entire school board meeting.
[02:13:27.162 --> 02:13:32.506]  Because the context matters and the context in every school board meeting matters from beginning to end.
[02:13:32.506 --> 02:13:52.183]  I know that a lot of people grab clips and they just stick with the clip, but I do want to later on set up the entire school board meeting because the individual who spoke in front of me was a pediatrician in town and he was advocating for the masks and he was advocating for the jabs and there's this consistent tone that's occurring where
[02:13:52.870 --> 02:13:55.732]  They want everybody masked until they get the jabs.
[02:13:55.732 --> 02:14:01.037]  But what we've already seen is is that they're fine pulling back on that.
[02:14:01.037 --> 02:14:05.120]  Even if they've had the jabs, they're still having to wear the masks.
[02:14:05.120 --> 02:14:14.628]  So I was watching a pattern happen from back in January in school board meetings where people weren't mentioning the jabs at all.
[02:14:14.628 --> 02:14:17.050]  It was all CRT and all mask wearing.
[02:14:17.557 --> 02:14:18.557]  That was it.
[02:14:18.557 --> 02:14:29.699]  And I kept saying on my podcast and I set it up a long, long time ago, I said, I'm probably going to have to go to this, go to one of these maybe and start talking about the jabs, but I'm going to take a back seat.
[02:14:29.699 --> 02:14:33.900]  I'm going to be conservative about this and I'm going to wait to see if someone else does it.
[02:14:33.900 --> 02:14:37.741]  And I didn't hear anybody do it for six plus months.
[02:14:37.741 --> 02:14:41.982]  And then I thought, well, there's an upcoming board meeting.
[02:14:42.805 --> 02:14:48.267]  At my old high school in the town where I live, so I'm going to see what they talked about in their last meeting.
[02:14:48.267 --> 02:15:02.971]  I watched the entire last school board meeting and gleefully they were talking about how they had mandated masks now for K through 5, but not 6 through 12.
[02:15:02.971 --> 02:15:04.832]  That that was optional.
[02:15:05.714 --> 02:15:17.855]  But they were still, you could hear it in their voices, that they were talking about, we need the jabs, we need to make this mandatory for our staff members, we need to make this ultimately mandatory for our students, and we have to move in that direction.
[02:15:18.274 --> 02:15:21.357]  That's very problematic for a variety of reasons.
[02:15:21.357 --> 02:15:24.879]  Extremely occultic, especially because it's poisonous and doesn't work.
[02:15:24.879 --> 02:15:35.388]  We're going to go to break and come back and talk about the big picture and why you got so upset and why you hit him so hard with that freezing cold water to get him out of their trance to realize this isn't a game.
[02:15:35.388 --> 02:15:36.309]  Because, yeah.
[02:15:37.089 --> 02:15:41.133]  Once people are dying later, they're gonna say, oh, it's a new variant or unvaccinated.
[02:15:41.133 --> 02:15:46.177]  We gotta tell them up front, it's the shot killed you, so at least then they'll know what hit them.
[02:15:46.177 --> 02:15:48.559]  We're to that triage point now, folks.
[02:15:48.559 --> 02:15:49.220]  This guy's smart.
[02:15:49.220 --> 02:15:49.940]  He knows what he's doing.
[02:15:49.940 --> 02:15:52.022]  Dr. Sean M. Brooks, PhD.
[02:15:52.022 --> 02:15:53.423]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:15:53.423 --> 02:15:53.884]  Stay with us.
[02:15:58.973 --> 02:15:59.934]  Hey everybody.
[02:15:59.934 --> 02:16:05.440]  If you've ever thought about heirloom beans as a storable survival food, I've got great news.
[02:16:05.440 --> 02:16:07.882]  In fact, I'll bet it's the best news you've heard in a while.
[02:16:07.882 --> 02:16:08.723]  Here's the thing.
[02:16:08.723 --> 02:16:13.028]  We've just received a fresh batch of gourmet heirloom beans.
[02:16:13.028 --> 02:16:13.969]  Survival soup beans.
[02:16:14.369 --> 02:16:22.556]  These beans are gorgeous, highly nutritious, and above all, with no hesitation whatsoever, the best tasting beans in the entire world.
[02:16:22.556 --> 02:16:23.657]  The best part?
[02:16:23.657 --> 02:16:32.624]  We've dropped the price by 33% this week for listeners who know higher food prices are coming and want an inflation hedge you can actually eat if you want to.
[02:16:32.884 --> 02:16:33.905]  Gets even better!
[02:16:33.905 --> 02:16:44.675]  With your permission, and with a high regard for your health and well-being, I also want to send you two pounds of what we think is the single most underrated superfood in the world.
[02:16:44.675 --> 02:16:45.496]  Period.
[02:16:45.496 --> 02:16:47.538]  Go to soupbeansurvival.com.
[02:16:47.538 --> 02:16:49.680]  That's soupbeansurvival.com.
[02:16:49.680 --> 02:16:53.783]  And discover the real reason we're giving this unusual superfood away.
[02:16:53.783 --> 02:16:55.665]  At soupbeansurvival.com.
[02:16:55.665 --> 02:16:57.527]  That's soupbeansurvival.com.
[02:17:00.836 --> 02:17:02.897]  Your voice counts.
[02:17:02.897 --> 02:17:07.959]  When you share information, be it over the internet or in person, it changes the world.
[02:17:07.959 --> 02:17:10.540]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[02:17:10.540 --> 02:17:12.041]  They know you're angry.
[02:17:12.041 --> 02:17:16.863]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.
[02:17:17.443 --> 02:17:28.190]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, if you sign up for our free news and show alerts, you can then take those alerts, those articles, and those live feeds, both the regular shows, the special reports, and share them with everyone you know.
[02:17:28.190 --> 02:17:32.513]  Take action now by texting the word NEWS, N-E-W-S, to 833-470-0438.
[02:17:32.513 --> 02:17:34.915]  That's 833-470-0438 for InfoWars Emergency News Alerts.
[02:17:34.915 --> 02:17:37.576]  Or, text the word SHOW to 833-470-0438 and receive live show notifications.
[02:17:47.503 --> 02:17:51.987]  Take action now, rate the chain reaction, and tell others to share those texts.
[02:17:51.987 --> 02:18:00.133]  Get news alerts at 833-470-0438.
[02:18:00.133 --> 02:18:11.882]  So, when I first started taking Survival Shield, basically I was 275 pounds, I was overweight, I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe, I was barely holding on to a job, and I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it.
[02:18:11.882 --> 02:18:15.305]  So the first one I got was the original Survival Shield, the X1, and it worked pretty
[02:18:15.845 --> 02:18:16.386]  Pretty good.
[02:18:16.386 --> 02:18:29.138]  And then, shortly thereafter, you came out with that studio, you know, with the Deep Bird Source, you know, and I got really excited about that, so I took it, and man, in two weeks, I went from brain fog to, like, literally, like, my brain was enlightened, you know?
[02:18:29.138 --> 02:18:30.200]  I could think again.
[02:18:30.200 --> 02:18:31.681]  I could connect with people again.
[02:18:31.741 --> 02:18:33.342]  Beautifully said, brother.
[02:18:33.342 --> 02:18:35.282]  I thank you so much for your call, and Godspeed.
[02:19:00.031 --> 02:19:05.396]  The purpose of fear is to call us into action, and there is plenty to be afraid of today.
[02:19:05.396 --> 02:19:14.805]  Half the population has lined up for an untested, deadly, and debilitating experimental injection because they were told to be afraid of an invisible, asymptomatic disease.
[02:19:15.445 --> 02:19:25.411]  The perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal of having 80% of the population hooked up to an artificial intelligence hive mind in less than nine years.
[02:19:25.411 --> 02:19:32.176]  For those of us who have awoken from the spell, we know this is all really happening, and it's unbelievably unsettling to see.
[02:19:32.176 --> 02:19:33.617]  But there is only two things to do.
[02:19:34.717 --> 02:19:37.878]  We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game.
[02:19:37.878 --> 02:19:41.199]  If enough people awaken from the cold spell, then we win.
[02:19:41.199 --> 02:19:46.581]  But even when we win, and we eventually will, the days of convenience are soon coming to an end.
[02:19:46.581 --> 02:19:48.401]  And so, we must prepare.
[02:19:48.401 --> 02:19:58.525]  Get up to a year's worth of storable foods, water filtration, survival gear, seeds, shortwave radios, and life-saving knowledge at infowarsstore.com.
[02:20:02.972 --> 02:20:15.456]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:15.456 --> 02:20:16.136]  Welcome back.
[02:20:16.136 --> 02:20:19.797]  I have some massive breaking news that ties into all this.
[02:20:19.797 --> 02:20:24.918]  I'm going to wait until next segment to drop it on the audience and our guest.
[02:20:24.918 --> 02:20:30.100]  Dr. Sean M. Brooks, PhD, author, researcher, podcaster, American Education, FM.com.
[02:20:31.533 --> 02:20:35.897]  Very excited listeners decided to share his four-minute video.
[02:20:35.897 --> 02:20:38.819]  He runs the American Education FM.
[02:20:38.819 --> 02:20:40.441]  You can see him right there on Gab.
[02:20:40.441 --> 02:20:42.162]  Be sure to follow him.
[02:20:42.162 --> 02:20:48.027]  But Doc, you've got the floor of this segment, but I want to just ask you a big picture.
[02:20:48.027 --> 02:20:50.689]  What would you call this time in history?
[02:20:50.689 --> 02:20:52.231]  How would you define the globalist?
[02:20:54.272 --> 02:20:57.534]  Where, I mean, where do you in the big picture think this is going?
[02:20:57.534 --> 02:20:59.795]  Because I see the evidence overwhelming.
[02:20:59.795 --> 02:21:01.416]  This is their big revolution.
[02:21:01.416 --> 02:21:02.396]  They're pedal to the metal.
[02:21:02.396 --> 02:21:09.420]  They're completely committed, trying to collapse civilization, to then pose as the saviors and bring in a new dark age in their own words.
[02:21:09.420 --> 02:21:13.442]  I mean, I just don't think people understand the magnitude of what we're facing.
[02:21:13.442 --> 02:21:14.703]  Do you disagree with that statement?
[02:21:14.703 --> 02:21:17.224]  And what would you call this time we're in right now?
[02:21:17.224 --> 02:21:19.665]  It's war.
[02:21:19.665 --> 02:21:20.746]  It's that simple.
[02:21:20.746 --> 02:21:21.146]  It's war.
[02:21:24.346 --> 02:21:34.449]  People are dying and there isn't a single person in the world, I don't think, who this has impacted in some way.
[02:21:34.449 --> 02:21:37.689]  So I've had family members who have taken the jabs.
[02:21:37.689 --> 02:21:38.530]  I'm fully aware.
[02:21:38.530 --> 02:21:41.390]  This has impacted everybody.
[02:21:41.390 --> 02:21:42.731]  You know, they're not fully awake.
[02:21:42.731 --> 02:21:44.011]  They don't know what's going on.
[02:21:44.011 --> 02:21:46.452]  Cognitive dissonance is very strong.
[02:21:46.452 --> 02:21:47.752]  I fully understand that.
[02:21:47.752 --> 02:21:51.313]  But fortunately, I woke up a long time ago.
[02:21:52.299 --> 02:22:12.661]  And when you've been through the ringer in the K-12 system and then you leave the K-12 system and I mean I was through the ringer as a whistleblower so I mean I went all the way through State Departments of Education and all the way back down I saw how they all operate I watched the entire thing and again I'm not calling myself a victim I'm just saying that
[02:22:13.306 --> 02:22:17.527]  In K-12 education, there are a lot of whistleblowers out there.
[02:22:17.527 --> 02:22:22.089]  Sure, you experienced how the bureaucracy destroys young minds and how the fraud works.
[02:22:22.089 --> 02:22:24.630]  You're saying you've been through the process.
[02:22:24.630 --> 02:22:25.690]  That's right.
[02:22:25.690 --> 02:22:30.792]  And as you would expect, state departments of education are remarkably corrupt.
[02:22:30.792 --> 02:22:32.092]  They stamp papers.
[02:22:32.092 --> 02:22:33.553]  They move things forward.
[02:22:33.553 --> 02:22:35.413]  School teachers can lawyer up all they want.
[02:22:35.413 --> 02:22:38.594]  It doesn't help, typically speaking anyway.
[02:22:38.594 --> 02:22:40.175]  Unions claim to stand up for them.
[02:22:40.175 --> 02:22:40.855]  They tend not to.
[02:22:42.098 --> 02:22:56.754]  It's just a giant con game and what we're watching, not just is a global war here in my opinion, is that we're watching the systematic destruction of K-12 education and higher education and frankly it cannot be saved.
[02:22:57.625 --> 02:23:00.246]  People need to run away from these institutions.
[02:23:00.246 --> 02:23:02.828]  They, in my opinion, they've shown their own hands.
[02:23:02.828 --> 02:23:03.448]  Oh, I totally agree.
[02:23:03.448 --> 02:23:04.629]  They're the cancer points.
[02:23:04.629 --> 02:23:12.613]  The globalists are using these as the invasion ports to collapse the rest of everything, just like the blue cities are designed to collapse everything.
[02:23:12.613 --> 02:23:13.514]  Right.
[02:23:13.514 --> 02:23:17.456]  And they're basically seeing how much they can get away with and how much people will tolerate.
[02:23:17.456 --> 02:23:23.339]  Well, one of the interesting things is, is I taught the cycle of abuse formally when I was a school teacher.
[02:23:23.339 --> 02:23:24.740]  I taught students what that was.
[02:23:25.734 --> 02:23:31.618]  And what K-12 schools are engaging in, and higher education institutions are engaging in, is the cycle of abuse.
[02:23:31.618 --> 02:23:37.582]  They want to see how many people will come back to the environment and continue to be punched in the face.
[02:23:37.582 --> 02:23:47.509]  And then they give them flowers, or they give them an award, or they give them a pat on the back, and they just want to see how many times they'll come back and continue to get punched in the face.
[02:23:47.509 --> 02:23:51.131]  I'm sorry, but, and I've said it on my podcast a million times,
[02:23:51.604 --> 02:24:05.732]  There's no unhealthier environment right now, because when you talk about workplace bullying as the phenomenon that it is, K-12 education and hospitals are two of the largest environments where workplace bullying takes place.
[02:24:05.732 --> 02:24:09.774]  Exactly, they've been turned into basically open-air re-education camps.
[02:24:09.774 --> 02:24:12.456]  They're laboratories of social control.
[02:24:12.456 --> 02:24:14.097]  Hospitals and schools.
[02:24:15.145 --> 02:24:31.472]  That's right, and when you abuse the people, the adults who are working there, who are trying to help, allegedly, and many of them do, and they do luminous work, it's inevitable that the mind of that individual is going to break and snap.
[02:24:31.472 --> 02:24:41.717]  It's inevitable that that's going to have a negative impact on the students that they're responsible for teaching factual information to, and that's why the turnover rate is as high as it is, and it's only increased
[02:24:42.877 --> 02:24:46.558]  In American K-12 education, higher education, and nurses.
[02:24:46.558 --> 02:25:03.581]  The difference now is we're seeing individuals leave for a variety of reasons and the last reason is making them physically ill by a jab that is being either mandated or they're asking to be mandated on a number of different people.
[02:25:03.581 --> 02:25:08.702]  We already have the state of California that's told all school teachers they have to take it.
[02:25:08.702 --> 02:25:10.162]  We already have the state of Washington
[02:25:10.623 --> 02:25:13.108]  That has told all teachers they have to take it.
[02:25:13.108 --> 02:25:16.555]  And I'm not if I could be wrong here, but I think just the other day.
[02:25:17.701 --> 02:25:20.022]  It was all Washington D.C.
[02:25:20.022 --> 02:25:20.582]  schools.
[02:25:20.582 --> 02:25:22.703]  All their staff members had to take it also.
[02:25:22.703 --> 02:25:23.763]  And let's expand on that.
[02:25:23.763 --> 02:25:27.905]  They're spinning it, Dr. Brooks, that, oh, that we've always had mandates.
[02:25:27.905 --> 02:25:29.106]  Yeah, they've had fake mandates.
[02:25:29.106 --> 02:25:32.107]  You've got to get a vaccine waiver from the health department.
[02:25:32.107 --> 02:25:36.888]  They've never had it where you've got to have this to get on a plane or a train or have a job.
[02:25:36.888 --> 02:25:38.749]  This is unprecedented.
[02:25:38.749 --> 02:25:45.932]  Plus, they want proof of it in a digital tracking system, which they admit is the backbone of a global ID system, which they'll then have.
[02:25:46.312 --> 02:25:53.056]  Carbon taxes added to, so we are literally having the chains fitted on us right now.
[02:25:53.056 --> 02:25:54.056]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:25:54.056 --> 02:25:56.858]  I mean, it's the old, I saw a meme just the other day.
[02:25:56.858 --> 02:25:59.219]  It's the chain dog.
[02:25:59.219 --> 02:26:06.062]  When you chain a dog to a post or a tree, it will inevitably become very angry.
[02:26:06.062 --> 02:26:12.126]  But when you remove one link at a time, it will just continue to get used to the chain.
[02:26:12.126 --> 02:26:14.667]  And then eventually they're right up against the tree and they can't even move.
[02:26:15.676 --> 02:26:16.496]  And that's happening.
[02:26:16.496 --> 02:26:20.317]  But what's not being reported is one of the things that I always pay attention to.
[02:26:20.317 --> 02:26:22.898]  Because again, I see the landscape like a lot of people do.
[02:26:22.898 --> 02:26:27.359]  And having studied qualitative reasoning and analysis, you look at the entire landscape.
[02:26:27.359 --> 02:26:31.380]  Having published research articles in XYZ, you have to do that.
[02:26:31.380 --> 02:26:33.041]  You have to be able to make predictions.
[02:26:33.041 --> 02:26:35.822]  You have to be able to see what's happened, what's coming.
[02:26:35.822 --> 02:26:41.003]  And at the end of those articles, you do have to say, hey, look, if this happens, then
[02:26:41.465 --> 02:26:43.246]  This is likely to happen down the line.
[02:26:43.246 --> 02:26:48.910]  If this doesn't happen, what's been discovered in research, then this is likely to happen on down the line.
[02:26:48.910 --> 02:26:54.153]  So, what I said in the board meeting is, even Dr. Mike Yeadon agreed with me.
[02:26:54.153 --> 02:26:57.875]  I mean, he said, it's possible if not plausible.
[02:26:57.875 --> 02:27:03.259]  So, I want people to understand the context of why I said what I said at the end because that matters.
[02:27:03.897 --> 02:27:05.398]  I'm not worried about Dr. Malone.
[02:27:05.398 --> 02:27:07.399]  He's wishy-washy as far as I'm concerned.
[02:27:07.399 --> 02:27:08.540]  He hasn't taken a hard stance.
[02:27:08.540 --> 02:27:09.580]  No, but you're right.
[02:27:09.580 --> 02:27:12.121]  This is designed to collapse civilization.
[02:27:12.121 --> 02:27:19.545]  It's a post-industrial plan, signed into global law, 2002, Rio de Janeiro, June 21.
[02:27:19.545 --> 02:27:23.127]  Even if 20% get sick or 10% die, it collapses civilization.
[02:27:23.127 --> 02:27:25.489]  The evidence from the studies, it's going to be far higher.
[02:27:25.489 --> 02:27:30.851]  So what you're doing is you're warning them so they know up front what's about to hit them, right?
[02:27:30.851 --> 02:27:31.692]  It's already happened.
[02:27:32.273 --> 02:27:42.561]  And here's where I noticed it, and this story came across my radar on my podcast back in March, and I grabbed it and I went, I'm going to read this and we need to pay attention to this.
[02:27:42.561 --> 02:27:46.564]  Schools in New Hampshire closed back in March.
[02:27:46.564 --> 02:27:52.469]  Entire districts closed for the entire week because their staff members were all giddy about getting the jab.
[02:27:52.469 --> 02:27:57.833]  And they all lined up to get it, and then hundreds of teachers were out sick from the initial reactions of the jab.
[02:27:57.833 --> 02:27:58.774]  I remember that!
[02:27:58.774 --> 02:27:59.555]  Yeah, that's right!
[02:28:00.410 --> 02:28:03.911]  Right, that doesn't mean the jab is working, it means it's poison.
[02:28:03.911 --> 02:28:13.875]  And that reaction that person has is a poison reaction that your immune system is saying, don't do this to me anymore, this is how I'll make you feel if you keep doing this to me.
[02:28:13.875 --> 02:28:15.796]  They closed down their schools and I thought
[02:28:17.666 --> 02:28:18.806]  What are they doing here?
[02:28:18.806 --> 02:28:19.927]  They're not paying attention.
[02:28:19.927 --> 02:28:23.590]  By the way, Doc, I know you're mainly an internet TV guy, which is great.
[02:28:23.590 --> 02:28:24.551]  So are we.
[02:28:24.551 --> 02:28:27.613]  But we have 200 affiliates, so we have to stop sometimes.
[02:28:27.613 --> 02:28:28.914]  Put it back on screen.
[02:28:28.914 --> 02:28:30.115]  Doctor's not making this up.
[02:28:30.115 --> 02:28:31.096]  Put it up.
[02:28:31.096 --> 02:28:33.017]  We got mainstream news here.
[02:28:33.017 --> 02:28:34.618]  That's WMUR9.
[02:28:34.618 --> 02:28:35.439]  Got a bunch of others.
[02:28:35.439 --> 02:28:35.759]  Some NH.
[02:28:36.880 --> 02:28:42.181]  Schools close Monday after teachers call in after receiving COVID-19 shots.
[02:28:42.181 --> 02:28:44.302]  And I saw that in Austin.
[02:28:44.302 --> 02:28:45.402]  I saw that in Dallas.
[02:28:45.402 --> 02:28:46.783]  I saw it in Seattle.
[02:28:46.783 --> 02:28:49.003]  Hundreds of articles I'd forgotten about.
[02:28:49.003 --> 02:28:50.444]  I'm glad Dr. Brooks brought that up.
[02:28:50.444 --> 02:28:53.865]  We'll come right back and talk about that on the other side.
[02:28:53.865 --> 02:28:54.825]  Wow.
[02:28:54.825 --> 02:28:55.185]  Wow.
[02:28:55.185 --> 02:28:56.165]  So he didn't make a prediction.
[02:28:56.165 --> 02:28:57.606]  He said what already happened.
[02:28:57.606 --> 02:28:58.146]  We'll be right back.
[02:28:58.976 --> 02:29:07.399]  If you're concerned about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of off-grid electricity, this will be the most important message you'll hear this year.
[02:29:07.399 --> 02:29:08.419]  Here's why.
[02:29:08.419 --> 02:29:12.281]  We now have a small number of solar generators back in stock.
[02:29:12.281 --> 02:29:17.403]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving backup power when you need it most.
[02:29:17.403 --> 02:29:25.826]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly, emit no dangerous fumes, and produce an endless supply of free electricity from the sun.
[02:29:26.386 --> 02:29:34.379]  Whether it's wildfires, dangerous weather, power grid issues, or just getting off the grid, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:29:35.080 --> 02:29:41.186]  Even better, all this week, radio listeners get over $700 in free off-the-grid bonuses too!
[02:29:41.186 --> 02:29:45.010]  Go to MySolarBackup.com to learn more and check availability.
[02:29:45.010 --> 02:29:47.032]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[02:29:47.032 --> 02:29:55.440]  Look for the free report, Crisis Cooling, how to make absolutely sure your meat, milk, and medicines stay safe and cool in any power outage.
[02:29:55.440 --> 02:29:57.803]  Yours free at MySolarBackup.com.
[02:30:00.225 --> 02:30:03.949]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[02:30:03.949 --> 02:30:07.674]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years, and only the last year or so have I said that.
[02:30:07.674 --> 02:30:14.962]  But let me tell you, the New World Order's breathing down our neck, the big globalist publications are coming after us, and they're doing everything they can to shut us down.
[02:30:15.322 --> 02:30:21.067]  So please pray to keep InfoWars on the air and please support the local station you're listening to as well.
[02:30:21.067 --> 02:30:33.298]  At the same time, go to InfoWarsStore.com while you still can and get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt, get some supplements because it's that money that helps us stay on air in the face of this thing.
[02:30:33.298 --> 02:30:35.440]  I need your help more than ever now.
[02:30:35.440 --> 02:30:37.242]  I want to keep fighting the globalists but I
[02:30:37.662 --> 02:30:39.544]  Can't do it if you don't support us.
[02:30:39.544 --> 02:30:50.155]  So, pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you can, and buy great products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at InfoWareStore.com.

[02:30:59.705 --> 02:31:00.346]  Thank you so much.
[02:31:00.976 --> 02:31:05.317]  All of the experts agree that getting proper sleep is the cornerstone of good health.
[02:31:05.317 --> 02:31:15.921]  It has been proven that a poor sleep schedule is linked with numerous health problems, including weight gain, memory issues, mood changes, poor concentration, and even a weakened immune system.
[02:31:15.921 --> 02:31:22.103]  Introducing RocketRest, the new product from our Dr. Jones Naturals line at InfowarsStore.com.

[02:31:30.646 --> 02:31:40.753]  Many competitors sleep formulas focus only on getting you to sleep, but Rocket Rest was specifically formulated to help you feel rested and ready to take on the next day.
[02:31:40.753 --> 02:31:48.559]  It uses a unique quick-release capsule system to ensure fast delivery of deep sleep support ingredients like melatonin and magnesium.

[02:32:01.161 --> 02:32:04.883]  Not all vitamin and mineral supplements are equal.
[02:32:04.883 --> 02:32:05.983]  Many of them are synthetic.
[02:32:05.983 --> 02:32:07.964]  Many of them have fillers and additives.
[02:32:07.964 --> 02:32:10.966]  Many of them just pass right through the body and are not absorbed.
[02:32:10.966 --> 02:32:19.850]  Well, that's not the case with our incredibly popular, because it's so effective, product that has now been sold out for months but is finally back in stock.
[02:32:19.850 --> 02:32:22.352]  And that is Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[02:32:22.352 --> 02:32:24.973]  All the essential vitamins, all the essential minerals,
[02:32:25.333 --> 02:32:29.454]  A bunch of amino acids help it upload better into your body and your cells.
[02:32:29.454 --> 02:32:30.415]  It's in powder form.
[02:32:30.415 --> 02:32:31.595]  It's great for children.
[02:32:31.595 --> 02:32:32.535]  It's great for adults.
[02:32:32.535 --> 02:32:37.317]  It's really important for folks that are older because they don't absorb as well through their guts.
[02:32:37.317 --> 02:32:39.558]  This liquid formula really, really does.
[02:32:39.558 --> 02:32:47.260]  You mix up a pitcher of it every couple days, put it in the refrigerator or keep it out in the kitchen, and just remember to drink it in the morning and in the evening.
[02:32:47.260 --> 02:32:48.281]  It tastes great.
[02:32:48.281 --> 02:32:49.621]  It makes your body healthy.
[02:32:49.621 --> 02:32:51.522]  It boosts your immune system, and it
[02:32:52.042 --> 02:32:54.306]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:33:20.486 --> 02:33:26.611]  Battling for a pro-human future against the eugenics depopulationist globalists.
[02:33:26.611 --> 02:33:27.212]  Welcome back.
[02:33:27.212 --> 02:33:28.493]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[02:33:28.493 --> 02:33:31.836]  Massive news has broken since we got our guest on.
[02:33:31.836 --> 02:33:33.037]  Let me mention some of it.
[02:33:33.037 --> 02:33:39.463]  We'll get his take on it and get back to the huge information he was just laying out.
[02:33:39.463 --> 02:33:41.124]  Adan Salazar has the article.
[02:33:41.124 --> 02:33:42.986]  It's on Infowars.com.
[02:33:42.986 --> 02:33:45.709]  It links right to the Israeli government's own announcement.
[02:33:46.397 --> 02:33:50.138]  Remember, Israel and Australia are the cutting edge of what's coming here next.
[02:33:50.138 --> 02:33:58.061]  Israel to grant green passports to fly and travel and go in restaurants.
[02:33:58.061 --> 02:34:04.404]  Israel to grant green passports only to triple vaccinated.
[02:34:04.404 --> 02:34:05.304]  That's how it works.
[02:34:05.304 --> 02:34:06.664]  Oh, maybe the vaccine isn't working.
[02:34:06.664 --> 02:34:09.465]  Oh, you got to take a third one recommended.
[02:34:09.465 --> 02:34:11.106]  Oh, now you've got to take it.
[02:34:11.106 --> 02:34:13.747]  And then a fourth and a fifth and a sixth and a tenth and a twentieth.
[02:34:14.913 --> 02:34:16.234]  Unbelievable.
[02:34:16.234 --> 02:34:16.675]  Study.
[02:34:16.675 --> 02:34:18.876]  Why are so many vaccinated people getting sick?
[02:34:18.876 --> 02:34:20.858]  Antibody-dependent enhancement.
[02:34:20.858 --> 02:34:23.280]  We'll talk about that with our guests in a minute, but look at this.
[02:34:23.280 --> 02:34:24.661]  Pfizer shot.
[02:34:24.661 --> 02:34:29.946]  Just 39% effective against Delta infection, which is the majority of infections.
[02:34:29.946 --> 02:34:30.927]  Forbes.
[02:34:30.927 --> 02:34:33.108]  That's their excuse to get around the fact it doesn't work.
[02:34:33.829 --> 02:34:37.213]  Bloomberg says, oh, looks like people get even sicker to have the vaccine.
[02:34:37.213 --> 02:34:38.414]  The answer, more vaccines.
[02:34:38.414 --> 02:34:39.335]  And now this today.
[02:34:39.335 --> 02:34:42.739]  Pfizer's CEO, same guy says he won't take it.
[02:34:42.739 --> 02:34:43.980]  Says he doesn't need to.
[02:34:43.980 --> 02:34:44.501]  I'm not kidding.
[02:34:44.501 --> 02:34:45.762]  I have a clip of it.
[02:34:45.762 --> 02:34:50.086]  Says COVID-19 vaccine, resistant variant, likely to emerge.
[02:34:50.086 --> 02:34:53.090]  So he tells you after the fact his cover story.
[02:34:55.080 --> 02:35:08.387]  So then I guess their stock stays up, which of course it will stay up because it's all based on a giant fraud of making you take more all the time as it destroys your immune system and renders you basically totally dependent on them.
[02:35:08.387 --> 02:35:09.308]  And here it is.
[02:35:09.308 --> 02:35:14.230]  Vaccines could drive the evolution of more COVID-19 mutants, which it did.
[02:35:14.230 --> 02:35:15.771]  NPR.
[02:35:15.771 --> 02:35:17.652]  And it goes on from there.
[02:35:17.652 --> 02:35:18.793]  And our guests mentioned this.
[02:35:19.793 --> 02:35:20.733]  Let's back him up.
[02:35:20.733 --> 02:35:22.874]  I'd forgotten about this.
[02:35:22.874 --> 02:35:24.754]  This is out of the Concord Monitor.
[02:35:24.754 --> 02:35:26.995]  Newly vaccinated teachers report side effects.
[02:35:26.995 --> 02:35:29.475]  Schools closed because so many were ill.
[02:35:29.475 --> 02:35:36.897]  Some New Hampshire schools closed after vaccinated teachers call in sick after receiving their shots.
[02:35:36.897 --> 02:35:37.817]  Emergency.
[02:35:37.817 --> 02:35:42.638]  The FDA now calls war and war drugs not just dangerous, but they give death warnings.
[02:35:44.136 --> 02:35:54.021]  All right, going back to Dr. Sean M. Brooks, PhD, who spoke out at his alma mater there in Ohio and went viral.
[02:35:54.021 --> 02:36:01.605]  You had left off there with warning the schools are going to be crippled, everything's going to be crippled by this, and that being the plan.
[02:36:01.605 --> 02:36:07.188]  Continue with that, and would you like to comment on what we knew was coming that, oh, guess what?
[02:36:07.188 --> 02:36:13.191]  There'll be monthly shots, basically, with your new vaccine passports.
[02:36:13.191 --> 02:36:13.611]  Yeah, that's...
[02:36:14.648 --> 02:36:15.989]  It's not surprising.
[02:36:15.989 --> 02:36:36.757]  I mean this was written about and spoken about over a year ago and you know I again back in March I tossed up an article for the first time on American Thinker and they accepted it and I said homeschooling is going to dramatically increase here in the future and there cannot be a bigger green flag for families to run
[02:36:37.782 --> 02:36:48.111]  toward homeschooling and and find these outlets and just very quickly I'd like to mention a few because again homeschooling and and hating on homeschooling is pure propaganda.
[02:36:48.111 --> 02:36:49.352]  That's exactly what it is.
[02:36:49.352 --> 02:36:56.338]  It's designed to keep people attached to the K-12 environment and not have a free mind and think for themselves.
[02:36:56.338 --> 02:37:00.982]  So I'm not a paid spokesperson for these websites but there's two of them that I recommend.
[02:37:00.982 --> 02:37:02.684]  Abeca.com is one of them.
[02:37:03.416 --> 02:37:06.478]  And CalvertEducation.com is another.
[02:37:06.478 --> 02:37:08.620]  I highly recommend people look into these.
[02:37:08.620 --> 02:37:09.701]  I've had guests on my show.
[02:37:09.701 --> 02:37:11.523]  So we're going to see a giant exodus.
[02:37:11.523 --> 02:37:13.744]  The whole future is going to be freedom.
[02:37:13.744 --> 02:37:21.791]  The whole future is people are going to figure out building our own civilization, our own society, and people need to start striking out now.
[02:37:21.791 --> 02:37:26.675]  Yeah, and it's the K-12 environments, of course, that are doing it themselves.
[02:37:26.675 --> 02:37:30.878]  They're destroying their own environment and they don't seem to know nor care.
[02:37:31.827 --> 02:37:34.848]  And they're taking a lot of good people with them, which is a shame.
[02:37:34.848 --> 02:37:41.770]  There's a lot of great non-teaching staff that work in these buildings that have their heads on straight, and they're seeing what's happening, and they don't like it.
[02:37:41.770 --> 02:37:44.871]  And I have always advocated for those individuals as well.
[02:37:44.871 --> 02:37:46.331]  The same thing is true with teachers.
[02:37:46.331 --> 02:37:48.572]  There are some teachers that are awake.
[02:37:48.572 --> 02:37:49.932]  They're fully awake.
[02:37:49.932 --> 02:37:52.633]  And then there are others that are just blind to all of it.
[02:37:52.633 --> 02:37:58.955]  And again, everybody saw the clip of the Utah teacher who got fired for popping off in her classroom.
[02:37:58.955 --> 02:38:01.456]  Everything she said is a fireable offense.
[02:38:02.173 --> 02:38:21.854]  And everything that they're doing, and this is big, everything that all of these school boards and administrators and school teachers have done over the last year now, unless they've rewritten their contracts to allow child abuse, or they've rewritten the terms of their agreements to include all of this abuse,
[02:38:22.310 --> 02:38:25.972]  If this were done back in 2019, they'd all be fired.
[02:38:25.972 --> 02:38:28.173]  And I know the process of how that all works.
[02:38:28.173 --> 02:38:30.414]  They'd be placed on administrative leave.
[02:38:30.414 --> 02:38:37.918]  If they were to walk into a classroom, see shower curtains hanging up in between people's desks, wearing masks, they would say, what are you doing?
[02:38:37.918 --> 02:38:43.981]  Well, Texas law, Texas law says making a child wear a mask is a form of cruel, unusual punishment.
[02:38:43.981 --> 02:38:47.622]  You can't make prisoners do that unless they've attacked people or whatever.
[02:38:47.622 --> 02:38:50.304]  So yeah, this is all illegal.
[02:38:50.304 --> 02:38:50.824]  Completely.
[02:38:51.758 --> 02:38:53.439]  And it's being sanctioned, and it's 100% allowed.
[02:38:53.439 --> 02:38:57.621]  Have you seen the schools in Georgia where they can't talk if they're expelled?
[02:38:57.621 --> 02:38:59.562]  So now they say don't look at each other or talk?
[02:38:59.562 --> 02:39:05.605]  And it's like cult members where they walk around not even talking?
[02:39:05.605 --> 02:39:07.206]  I haven't, but I don't doubt it.
[02:39:07.206 --> 02:39:11.028]  And the imagery alone should shake anybody to the core.
[02:39:11.028 --> 02:39:15.671]  The second that I started to see that, I thought, they've crossed the bridge.
[02:39:15.671 --> 02:39:16.992]  They've crossed the line.
[02:39:16.992 --> 02:39:20.253]  And they're not going to go back to anything else anymore.
[02:39:20.253 --> 02:39:21.234]  They've played their hand.
[02:39:21.724 --> 02:39:25.447]  They've shown everyone what an abusive environment they are.
[02:39:25.447 --> 02:39:26.747]  Now, is it happening everywhere?
[02:39:26.747 --> 02:39:27.248]  No.
[02:39:27.248 --> 02:39:33.612]  There are private schools that are shielding their students and their staff from everything that's going on, and God bless them.
[02:39:33.612 --> 02:39:37.755]  We also know that there are private schools that are demanding everybody get jabbed.
[02:39:37.755 --> 02:39:42.018]  There was a Tennessee school that did that a few months ago.
[02:39:42.018 --> 02:39:44.099]  I brought that up on my podcast.
[02:39:44.099 --> 02:39:46.260]  I played the guy's audio who runs the school.
[02:39:46.260 --> 02:39:48.742]  I mean, he sounded not well.
[02:39:48.742 --> 02:39:49.903]  And these people aren't well.
[02:39:50.558 --> 02:39:52.678]  These are all abusive tactics.
[02:39:52.678 --> 02:39:54.579]  They're all being normalized.
[02:39:54.579 --> 02:40:06.981]  And it's being normalized generationally, of course, as many of us know, for the sole purpose of creating a generation of people that can easily be controlled down the line if the Jabs don't get them first.
[02:40:06.981 --> 02:40:09.041]  So... How do we fight back against this?
[02:40:09.041 --> 02:40:14.602]  Obviously get people out of school, sue the school, say no, go speak at school board meetings.
[02:40:14.602 --> 02:40:16.343]  I mean, what do we do?
[02:40:16.343 --> 02:40:18.423]  Because it's just all out in the open now.
[02:40:19.962 --> 02:40:24.585]  I don't think that speaking at school board meetings is going to do the trick anymore.
[02:40:24.585 --> 02:40:27.267]  I've commented on that on my podcast.
[02:40:27.267 --> 02:40:33.571]  I'm not saying it does the trick, but people like school boards, city councils, those go viral.
[02:40:33.571 --> 02:40:38.354]  So if somebody gets 100,000 views, not just what's seen locally, that helps others.
[02:40:38.354 --> 02:40:42.677]  I think this is one of the few venues, actually, where media is getting out to a larger group.
[02:40:42.677 --> 02:40:45.438]  I get you're saying it doesn't help the school board because they're arrogant and don't care.
[02:40:45.438 --> 02:40:47.960]  But I'm saying as a venue, you get it out, it's working.
[02:40:49.076 --> 02:40:53.458]  Yes, I'm certain it's waking people up, as it should, which is why I said what I said.
[02:40:53.458 --> 02:40:59.860]  They aren't thinking about what they're doing when it comes to putting their own staff members in harm's way.
[02:40:59.860 --> 02:41:08.503]  They've already abused children, and they've already tried to normalize that among parents, so much so that you have parents now abusing their own children and thinking that it's normal.
[02:41:08.503 --> 02:41:12.084]  And they're not calling it abuse, of course, they're saying it's under the guise of health.
[02:41:12.084 --> 02:41:13.785]  It's not helping them.
[02:41:14.378 --> 02:41:16.620]  There you go, like that imagery right there.
[02:41:16.620 --> 02:41:18.021]  I have that in my last book.
[02:41:18.021 --> 02:41:19.802]  That was insane.
[02:41:19.802 --> 02:41:25.407]  That imagery of those... This is what you would see in the most radical cults.
[02:41:25.407 --> 02:41:26.488]  That's right.
[02:41:26.488 --> 02:41:27.548]  It's nuts.
[02:41:27.548 --> 02:41:32.192]  And if a band teacher were doing that in 2019, they'd be fired.
[02:41:32.192 --> 02:41:39.938]  I watched a school teacher get fired for making students go to the bathroom while wearing a construction vest as a hall pass.
[02:41:41.428 --> 02:41:43.770]  They were fired like that, for doing that.
[02:41:43.770 --> 02:41:45.411]  But this is okay?
[02:41:45.411 --> 02:41:47.153]  No, it's not okay.
[02:41:47.153 --> 02:41:53.197]  The system is training us to be humiliated and dominated and controlled.
[02:41:53.197 --> 02:41:54.138]  Completely.
[02:41:54.138 --> 02:41:59.782]  And homeschooling parents and homeschooling students and families are laughing their tails off right now.
[02:41:59.782 --> 02:42:04.026]  But they're compassionate people too, and they're very sad with what's going on.
[02:42:04.026 --> 02:42:05.027]  And I'm certain that they are.
[02:42:05.027 --> 02:42:10.371]  Let's not make no mistake, once the globalists from the colleges have taken over all the schools, the public schools,
[02:42:10.771 --> 02:42:11.831]  They're going to come take over.
[02:42:11.831 --> 02:42:13.112]  They're coming for everybody.
[02:42:13.112 --> 02:42:15.733]  So people better know, this is a total takeover plan.
[02:42:15.733 --> 02:42:22.475]  So folks shouldn't be confident just because they live in the middle of Montana or Oklahoma and all your neighbors are awake and stuff.
[02:42:22.475 --> 02:42:27.376]  That's great, but believe me, the globalists are coming for you next.
[02:42:27.376 --> 02:42:33.378]  And the local city councils have their hooks in school boards and they have their hooks in universities.
[02:42:33.378 --> 02:42:39.280]  Our local city council was upset that Miami University would not mandate the jabs.
[02:42:39.622 --> 02:42:41.623]  Humanity is the main stakeholder on this planet.
[02:43:03.075 --> 02:43:14.884]  But the big corporations for a hundred years have told us that humans are bad and evil and a pestilence on the earth so that we begin to believe we're bad and we'll turn off our life force and let the eugenics-based globalists take control of the planet.
[02:43:14.884 --> 02:43:18.187]  If you go to Klaus Schwab, the head of the Daedalus Group's own Wikipedia page,
[02:43:18.687 --> 02:43:27.131]  He brags on there about how they're capturing democracy and taking over governments worldwide to set up a corporate dictatorship under the UN.
[02:43:27.131 --> 02:43:29.432]  They admit all of this.
[02:43:29.432 --> 02:43:30.693]  They plan the lockdowns.
[02:43:30.693 --> 02:43:32.394]  They release the viruses.
[02:43:32.394 --> 02:43:34.115]  They think you're stupid.
[02:43:34.115 --> 02:43:40.198]  And their plan is to slowly cut off the resources so they can dictate total social control over you and your lives.
[02:43:40.778 --> 02:43:51.361]  That's how I was able to predict everything they did decades before they executed it, word for word, with total precision, because they have a detailed battle plan.
[02:43:51.361 --> 02:43:52.721]  We cover it live weekdays, 11 a.m.
[02:43:52.721 --> 02:43:52.861]  to 3 p.m.
[02:43:52.861 --> 02:44:05.505]  at infowars.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.
[02:44:12.009 --> 02:44:13.530]  AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline.
[02:44:13.530 --> 02:44:15.450]  AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline.
[02:44:15.450 --> 02:44:16.611]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline.
[02:44:16.611 --> 02:44:18.111]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store... Wait!
[02:44:18.111 --> 02:44:19.212]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline.
[02:44:19.212 --> 02:44:20.512]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store...
[02:44:38.198 --> 02:44:41.662]  InfoWarsStore.com is simply the best.
[02:44:41.662 --> 02:44:44.946]  InfoWarsStore.com beats out all the rest.
[02:44:44.946 --> 02:44:45.166]  888-253-3139, 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[02:44:45.166 --> 02:44:46.227]  It's the InfoWars Store Online.
[02:44:46.227 --> 02:44:46.448]  888-253-3139, 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[02:44:46.448 --> 02:44:47.209]  That's InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:45:00.501 --> 02:45:23.490]  Let's go back in time, say to the mid-1990s, and then imagine a science fiction movie set in the year 2020, where a world government's being established, where members of Congress and former presidents are censored by big tech, and where if you don't take an experimental injection that grows blood clots and prions all over your body, then you're not allowed to fly on an airplane.
[02:45:24.170 --> 02:45:26.472]  Think about that, because that's where we are.
[02:45:26.472 --> 02:45:33.217]  Imagine just 20, 30 years ago, hell, just 5 years ago, if somebody told you this would be happening.
[02:45:33.217 --> 02:45:35.298]  But it is happening now.
[02:45:35.298 --> 02:45:41.863]  And then they tell you, oh sorry, it's not a vaccine, it's a gene therapy, and it doesn't really work, so you gotta take it every few months.
[02:45:41.863 --> 02:45:44.405]  And the people that have submitted say, great!
[02:45:44.405 --> 02:45:47.507]  I want to take it all the time so I can go outside and not get sick from COVID.
[02:45:48.107 --> 02:45:49.828]  Even though it gets you sick from COVID.
[02:45:49.828 --> 02:45:54.391]  And now there's record numbers of really sick people from the sloughing, the shedding of the virus.
[02:45:54.391 --> 02:45:56.593]  And that's in mainline studies.
[02:45:56.593 --> 02:45:58.014]  Bill Gates and Fauci did this.
[02:45:58.014 --> 02:45:59.595]  Need to go to prison for it right now.
[02:46:00.544 --> 02:46:04.288]  Not all vitamin and mineral supplements are equal.
[02:46:04.288 --> 02:46:05.389]  Many of them are synthetic.
[02:46:05.389 --> 02:46:07.351]  Many of them have fillers and additives.
[02:46:07.351 --> 02:46:10.373]  Many of them just pass right through the body and are not absorbed.
[02:46:10.373 --> 02:46:19.262]  Well, that's not the case with our incredibly popular, because it's so effective, product that has now been sold out for months, but is finally back in stock.
[02:46:19.262 --> 02:46:21.744]  And that is Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[02:46:21.744 --> 02:46:24.387]  All the essential vitamins, all the essential minerals,
[02:46:24.747 --> 02:46:28.849]  A bunch of key amino acids to help it upload better into your body and your cells.
[02:46:28.849 --> 02:46:29.809]  It's in powder form.
[02:46:29.809 --> 02:46:30.950]  It's great for children.
[02:46:30.950 --> 02:46:31.930]  It's great for adults.
[02:46:31.930 --> 02:46:36.472]  It's really important for folks that are older, because they don't absorb as well through their guts.
[02:46:36.472 --> 02:46:38.953]  So this liquid formula really, really does it.
[02:46:38.953 --> 02:46:46.657]  You mix up a pitcher of it every couple days, put it in the refrigerator, or keep it out in the kitchen, and just remember to drink it in the morning and in the evening.
[02:46:46.657 --> 02:46:47.677]  It tastes great.
[02:46:47.677 --> 02:46:49.018]  It makes your body healthy.
[02:46:49.018 --> 02:46:50.138]  It boosts your immune system.
[02:46:51.459 --> 02:46:54.501]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:47:18.246 --> 02:47:20.128]  We are back live.
[02:47:20.128 --> 02:47:23.351]  Owen Schroer is going to be popping in about 15 minutes to the next hour.
[02:47:23.351 --> 02:47:26.234]  I've got a ton of news and information we haven't hit yet.
[02:47:26.234 --> 02:47:31.740]  We're going to be going over with them, including... Did I call President Trump a dumbass?
[02:47:31.740 --> 02:47:34.903]  No, I said, I think Trump's really smart.
[02:47:34.903 --> 02:47:36.745]  Why is he saying that the vaccines work?
[02:47:37.830 --> 02:47:54.217]  Why is he saying he took it and it's great and if it doesn't work he'll tell us when I just showed you and it's been out for days that Pfizer says it's a 39% efficacy rate and now the head of Pfizer says oh new variants are here and his vaccine doesn't work but don't worry he's got new ones.
[02:47:54.217 --> 02:48:03.241]  And Trump had just said days before he said that in Alabama on Friday, Trump had said it looks like a scam by Pfizer with these boosters.
[02:48:04.787 --> 02:48:06.028]  So I said, you're smart, Trump.
[02:48:06.028 --> 02:48:08.008]  I don't think you're dumb, but maybe you are.
[02:48:08.008 --> 02:48:09.729]  Yeah, I stand by that.
[02:48:09.729 --> 02:48:10.610]  That's BS.
[02:48:10.610 --> 02:48:12.170]  It's not effective.
[02:48:12.170 --> 02:48:16.932]  If it lowers your immunity already, and it's now 39%.
[02:48:16.932 --> 02:48:20.154]  But the media spins it like, Jones leaving the sinking ship.
[02:48:20.154 --> 02:48:21.535]  Jones running for Trump.
[02:48:21.535 --> 02:48:26.157]  I've always criticized Trump when he's wrong.
[02:48:26.157 --> 02:48:28.978]  Not on some Trump cult bandwagon.
[02:48:28.978 --> 02:48:33.440]  I support President Trump because he stood up to China and defended our borders, and I think he means well, but
[02:48:35.128 --> 02:48:37.990]  He's also known to be pig-headed.
[02:48:37.990 --> 02:48:39.470]  And he got lied to.
[02:48:39.470 --> 02:48:41.472]  The sign is like, oh, this will fix it, sir.
[02:48:41.472 --> 02:48:43.933]  But it wasn't really a vaccine like they were saying.
[02:48:43.933 --> 02:48:45.374]  So he got conned.
[02:48:45.374 --> 02:48:46.855]  And he won't admit he's wrong.
[02:48:46.855 --> 02:48:50.176]  And so I'm going to go after him for it.
[02:48:50.176 --> 02:48:50.957]  That's the way it works.
[02:48:53.422 --> 02:48:56.363]  Let me get Dr. Sean M. Brooks, Ph.D.'
[02:48:56.343 --> 02:48:57.503]  's take on this.
[02:48:57.503 --> 02:48:59.443]  AmericanEducationFM.com.
[02:48:59.443 --> 02:49:03.704]  Clearly focused on education and the great viral speech you gave and it's all backed up by evidence.
[02:49:03.704 --> 02:49:10.345]  But how big a deal is this to have Pfizer say, OK, the vaccine doesn't work, but don't worry, I got new ones for you every month.
[02:49:10.345 --> 02:49:14.266]  I mean, you can see the Bill Gates and them said this a year and a half ago, as you were saying earlier.
[02:49:14.266 --> 02:49:19.107]  This has been the business model all along.
[02:49:19.107 --> 02:49:21.507]  If people can't see the inconsistencies,
[02:49:22.923 --> 02:49:28.305]  I'm not sure that they can be helped, which is again why I said what I said.
[02:49:28.305 --> 02:49:30.125]  This was a room with individuals.
[02:49:30.125 --> 02:49:35.367]  The vast majority in that school board meeting were patriots, without a doubt.
[02:49:35.367 --> 02:49:40.169]  They were all behind me and to my right, and they made up the majority of the room.
[02:49:40.169 --> 02:49:44.090]  And for the most part, they know what's going on.
[02:49:44.090 --> 02:49:48.011]  The message was for the school board members as a shot over the bow.
[02:49:48.864 --> 02:49:54.449]  You, like that individual right there that you're showing, he was talking about how he's moving to Montana with his kids.
[02:49:54.449 --> 02:49:54.949]  He's out.
[02:49:54.949 --> 02:49:56.730]  He's done.
[02:49:56.730 --> 02:49:58.251]  And there were a lot of people like that.
[02:49:58.251 --> 02:49:59.312]  They said they've had enough.
[02:49:59.312 --> 02:50:02.455]  Another individual stood up in that board meeting after I spoke.
[02:50:02.455 --> 02:50:05.217]  And I went home after I spoke because I didn't want to get killed.
[02:50:05.217 --> 02:50:10.441]  But I went home after I spoke and I watched the entire thing from beginning to end.
[02:50:10.441 --> 02:50:15.305]  And another individual stood up and had the law in their hands.
[02:50:15.305 --> 02:50:17.186]  And they said, you're felons.
[02:50:17.186 --> 02:50:18.287]  You're all felons now.
[02:50:18.786 --> 02:50:25.469]  Because you've mandated the mask, and the mask in Ohio is considered a medical device, and this breaks countless laws.
[02:50:25.469 --> 02:50:26.450]  So now you're all felons.
[02:50:26.450 --> 02:50:28.451]  And it's in one ear and out the other.
[02:50:28.451 --> 02:50:35.254]  I mean, it's always going to be with most school board members, because that comes with the territory, and that's the personality type.
[02:50:35.254 --> 02:50:37.955]  They have orders, and they follow them.
[02:50:37.955 --> 02:50:43.318]  And those orders come from the top down, and they're all being squeezed, and they're all being paid.
[02:50:43.318 --> 02:50:45.259]  These are not independent school districts.
[02:50:45.259 --> 02:50:47.840]  How do we ever get back to them being independent school districts?
[02:50:49.619 --> 02:50:50.980]  You can't.
[02:50:50.980 --> 02:50:55.022]  Well, even if they're independent, they're still receiving funds.
[02:50:55.022 --> 02:50:55.582]  No, no, I get it.
[02:50:55.582 --> 02:50:59.424]  They have independent in the name, but they're not independent.
[02:50:59.424 --> 02:51:00.865]  Right, that's correct.
[02:51:00.865 --> 02:51:04.627]  And, you know, again, more pop-up charter schools would be a nice thing.
[02:51:04.627 --> 02:51:06.508]  Hillsdale College, I'll mention them.
[02:51:06.508 --> 02:51:13.512]  I'm not a paid spokesperson again, but if I didn't say it earlier, Hillsdale College has pop-up K-12 schools all over the United States.
[02:51:14.025 --> 02:51:20.808]  And they're always interested in hearing from other individuals in other states and saying, hey, look, we've got a vacant building over here.
[02:51:20.808 --> 02:51:23.049]  We would love for you to come here and implement.
[02:51:23.049 --> 02:51:23.610]  Exactly.
[02:51:23.610 --> 02:51:26.631]  In fact, I have I have family who paid forever.
[02:51:26.631 --> 02:51:29.553]  This big Christian private school, it's like 80 years old.
[02:51:29.553 --> 02:51:31.834]  They ordered all the teachers to take shots.
[02:51:31.834 --> 02:51:34.575]  They want the kids over 12 to take it and everything.
[02:51:34.575 --> 02:51:37.016]  So half the school just left, pulled all their children out.
[02:51:37.016 --> 02:51:38.457]  They're just starting a whole new church school.
[02:51:38.457 --> 02:51:40.118]  I mean, the answer is innovation here.
[02:51:41.927 --> 02:51:43.027]  It really is.
[02:51:43.027 --> 02:51:49.028]  And again, a sound curriculum is not typically allowed in K-12 schools.
[02:51:49.028 --> 02:51:53.849]  They can pull the plug on BitChute in an instant.
[02:51:53.849 --> 02:51:55.890]  They can pull the plug on YouTube in an instant.
[02:51:55.890 --> 02:52:01.671]  And again, people watching YouTube at this point, I would say you're watching the wrong thing.
[02:52:01.671 --> 02:52:06.612]  They're suppressing the truth without a doubt, and they're a cog in the wheel, which is too bad.
[02:52:06.612 --> 02:52:06.992]  You're right.
[02:52:06.992 --> 02:52:08.932]  YouTube is the most censored platform now.
[02:52:09.847 --> 02:52:10.908]  No doubt about it.
[02:52:10.908 --> 02:52:16.533]  I mean, BitChute and Gab and Telegram and Band.Video, I mean, that's where it's at right now.
[02:52:16.533 --> 02:52:20.937]  And it has to be that way, and we have to do whatever we can to maintain that.
[02:52:20.937 --> 02:52:30.486]  But if a K-12 student is in an environment like that, and they're on their cell phone, and they're trying to look up that kind of information on those platforms, they'll get their cell phone snatched right out of their hands.
[02:52:30.486 --> 02:52:33.028]  If they do it on a computer, on a school-sanctioned computer,
[02:52:33.812 --> 02:52:37.714]  The internet servers at the district level pick that up and then they'll cut the line.
[02:52:37.714 --> 02:52:51.200]  Oh yeah, it's not just InfoWars, it's tens of thousands of sites, including the Intercept and Glenn Greenwald and people, are blocked in those databases created by Microsoft and others.
[02:52:51.200 --> 02:52:52.821]  I completely agree with you.
[02:52:52.821 --> 02:52:53.802]  I mean, there's no doubt about it.
[02:52:55.390 --> 02:53:01.332]  As far as the school board meeting is concerned, the people in that room don't know about Dr. Zelenko for the most part.
[02:53:01.332 --> 02:53:05.133]  Again, the people who are Patriots probably do.
[02:53:05.133 --> 02:53:08.014]  You know, the five docs on Rumble on the Critically Thinking Channel.
[02:53:08.014 --> 02:53:12.955]  These are the people that I pay attention to, I listen to, and I take in all of their information.
[02:53:12.955 --> 02:53:14.435]  Dr. Mike Yeadon, same thing.
[02:53:14.435 --> 02:53:21.677]  I could have name-dropped throughout the entire thing, but I had to cut to the chase because, again, I was limited in time.
[02:53:21.677 --> 02:53:23.938]  I showed up thinking I might have five minutes.
[02:53:24.638 --> 02:53:40.072]  I previously taped a guy who was given four and a half minutes in the last meeting in July, and I walked in, met some wonderful women in the back, some of which who worked for the district as non-teaching staff, and I said, how much time do I have?
[02:53:40.072 --> 02:53:48.639]  And they said, three minutes, but if you're kind to them up front, and you're just kind of running through the motions and you're speaking quickly, they might give you a little more time.
[02:53:48.639 --> 02:53:50.381]  Well, they gave me almost four minutes solid.
[02:53:51.218 --> 02:53:58.744]  Which was fine, but I had to cut, I mean, I had two pages of information I wanted to read off and I had to cut it at least in half.
[02:53:58.744 --> 02:54:09.972]  So, I was getting down to brass tacks and once he said you got 15 minutes, that's when I grabbed him by the lapels and I said, look, this has already happened, it's going to happen, you can't stop what's coming here.
[02:54:09.972 --> 02:54:15.196]  And here's the thing, they're going to lie about it in the future and we know that.
[02:54:15.196 --> 02:54:16.097]  They're going to say
[02:54:16.963 --> 02:54:18.563]  We have teachers out who are sick.
[02:54:18.563 --> 02:54:19.703]  We need substitutes.
[02:54:19.703 --> 02:54:22.904]  They're never going to tell you why they're out sick.
[02:54:22.904 --> 02:54:24.244]  They're not going to say that.
[02:54:24.244 --> 02:54:27.045]  If they say that, the cat's out of the bag then.
[02:54:27.045 --> 02:54:35.946]  Because we already see them lying about variants and we see them lying and saying it's the unjabbed that are getting people sick.
[02:54:35.946 --> 02:54:37.547]  That's absurd.
[02:54:37.547 --> 02:54:41.287]  And the immune system, human immune system, does not operate that way.
[02:54:41.287 --> 02:54:45.708]  If you pump your body with poison, you will get sick.
[02:54:45.708 --> 02:54:46.148]  That's it.
[02:54:47.011 --> 02:55:13.899]  And the irony is that the K-12 environment, the same environment that taught us as minors to not believe peer pressure, to not take drugs, and to not believe peer pressure and take drugs from strangers, is the same environment now that is pushing this full bore down the throats of countless people, adults, children, and now they're all co-mingling in these environments as if nothing bad is going to happen.
[02:55:14.477 --> 02:55:16.518]  Again, I've said this on my podcast.
[02:55:16.518 --> 02:55:21.161]  You don't need a Ouija board, tea leaves, and chicken bones to figure this out.
[02:55:21.161 --> 02:55:30.347]  When cold and flu season rolls around, as even Dr. Zelenko said, you're talking about a ticking time bomb when it comes to a person's immune system.
[02:55:30.347 --> 02:55:31.908]  I mean, you just are.
[02:55:31.908 --> 02:55:34.449]  And Indiana University is another example.
[02:55:34.449 --> 02:55:41.434]  Over the summer, before summer, they said everybody who works here and everybody who comes here has to be jabbed.
[02:55:41.434 --> 02:55:42.734]  End of story.
[02:55:42.734 --> 02:55:43.495]  As you would expect.
[02:55:44.195 --> 02:55:48.497]  Countless students and parents started to sue Indiana University.
[02:55:48.497 --> 02:55:55.500]  A judge got involved, and if I'm not mistaken, the judge sided with Indiana University and said, they get to do what they want.
[02:55:56.797 --> 02:56:00.922]  I could have that wrong, but I think that's right as to how that ended up settling out.
[02:56:00.922 --> 02:56:03.945]  So, everybody who attends now is jabbed.
[02:56:03.945 --> 02:56:04.405]  That's 100%.
[02:56:04.405 --> 02:56:05.887]  That's Avery Coney Barrett.
[02:56:05.887 --> 02:56:06.548]  Alright, stay there.
[02:56:06.548 --> 02:56:07.949]  I'm going to come back to you.
[02:56:07.949 --> 02:56:14.196]  And speaking of you wanting to be able to speak five minutes at that school board meeting where you're knocked out of the park, let's give you...
[02:56:15.285 --> 02:56:19.686]  When we come back, this segment's only five, so we'll talk then with the next segment.
[02:56:19.686 --> 02:56:26.369]  I'm gonna just shut up for five minutes and you can give your full speech that you were unable to give on the other side.
[02:56:26.369 --> 02:56:28.289]  We really appreciate your perspective.
[02:56:28.289 --> 02:56:31.090]  Everything else, Dr. Sean M. Brooks, PhD.
[02:56:31.090 --> 02:56:32.871]  Okay, folks, we're gonna go to break here.
[02:56:34.155 --> 02:56:37.217]  Please don't forget, the way we stay on air is you buying products.
[02:56:37.217 --> 02:56:39.579]  We don't have big sponsors, we have you.
[02:56:39.579 --> 02:56:46.644]  Infowarsstore.com has a big special, the Vitamin Mineral Fusion that's so good for your immune system and all your body's functions.
[02:56:46.644 --> 02:56:48.686]  It has all the vitamins, all the minerals.
[02:56:49.326 --> 02:56:53.550]  And on top of that, it's got a bunch of key amino acids as well.
[02:56:53.550 --> 02:56:54.551]  It's back in stock.
[02:56:54.551 --> 02:56:55.793]  It's been sold out for a long time.
[02:56:55.793 --> 02:56:56.433]  33% off.
[02:56:56.433 --> 02:56:59.556]  It's great for children, adults, and especially old folks.
[02:56:59.556 --> 02:57:03.860]  Because a lot of vitamins and minerals are great, but they're in pill form and some people don't absorb them good.
[02:57:03.860 --> 02:57:07.504]  This is liquid, so you get a much, much higher absorption rate.
[02:57:07.504 --> 02:57:09.967]  Vitamin and mineral fusion, back in stock, 33% off.
[02:57:09.967 --> 02:57:13.250]  Living Defense has got a bunch of things like concentrated black walnut, other things.
[02:57:13.630 --> 02:57:14.211]  That's right.
[02:57:32.737 --> 02:57:33.057]  Everything.
[02:57:33.057 --> 02:57:34.178]  40% off.
[02:57:34.178 --> 02:57:37.559]  Basil Beets creates nitrous oxide in the body, concentrated beet extract.
[02:57:37.559 --> 02:57:40.120]  It's 50% off and more.
[02:57:40.120 --> 02:57:41.881]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:57:41.881 --> 02:57:43.522]  That's what funds the operation.
[02:57:43.522 --> 02:57:44.703]  We'll be right back.
[02:57:44.703 --> 02:57:45.123]  Stay with us.
[02:57:48.976 --> 02:57:55.403]  It is through our five senses that we are kept fascinated and hypnotized by the lies we are told.
[02:57:55.403 --> 02:58:02.791]  And the only way to see through this illusion is with our higher senses, which is why fluoridated water is a big problem.
[02:58:02.791 --> 02:58:04.172]  Consuming too much fluoride
[02:58:04.192 --> 02:58:05.132]  That's right.
[02:58:25.897 --> 02:58:29.200]  And otherwise, unseen dimensions of reality.
[02:58:29.200 --> 02:58:34.204]  Fluoride-free water is essential to keeping our pineal gland healthy.
[02:58:34.204 --> 02:58:40.449]  Our water filtration systems, with the proper filters, will keep your drinking water fluoride-free.
[02:58:40.449 --> 02:58:43.312]  And the Pro-Pure showerhead will seal the deal.
[02:58:43.312 --> 02:58:48.116]  Get them both today, for yourself or a friend, at Infowarestore.com.
[02:58:50.984 --> 02:58:57.767]  There's one central fact of criminal psychology that criminologists all agree on.
[02:58:57.767 --> 02:59:01.329]  And that is criminals are extremely pathological.
[02:59:01.329 --> 02:59:04.850]  Even more the general public, they do the same things over and over again.
[02:59:04.850 --> 02:59:10.453]  And criminals like to commit the same types of crimes over and over again.
[02:59:10.453 --> 02:59:11.293]  Well guess what?
[02:59:11.293 --> 02:59:15.275]  It was Anthony Fauci and Eugenicist Globalist that
[02:59:16.414 --> 02:59:31.268]  ran the rollout of HIV and the mistreatment of it with AZT and other chemicals that actually killed more people than HIV and they were the ones involved in viral research of viruses that would actually go attack the T lymphocytes of the body and create autoimmune disorders.
[02:59:31.969 --> 02:59:38.331]  The problem for them was, the viruses would then break down and would be non-lethal down the road.
[02:59:38.331 --> 02:59:46.774]  That's why they need to roll out the COVID-19 and the vaccine, because now they admit the COVID-19 vaccine destroys your immune system, basically giving you the equivalent of HIV.
[02:59:46.774 --> 02:59:53.336]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:59:53.336 --> 02:59:55.957]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:06.819 --> 03:00:12.883]  All right, we got this segment and a little bit of the next segment with Dr. Sean M. Brooks.
[03:00:12.883 --> 03:00:18.888]  I'll have the floor, like he's speaking at the local school board there in Ohio, hailing from Oxford, Ohio.
[03:00:18.888 --> 03:00:21.470]  In the next segment, I got a bunch of news.
[03:00:21.470 --> 03:00:26.294]  Blitzkrieg with Owen Schroer in here before he takes over and has three hours to warn himself.
[03:00:26.294 --> 03:00:31.738]  But Doc, just as a human, as a patriot, do you have hope with what's going on in the world?
[03:00:31.738 --> 03:00:34.220]  Because like you said, this is war, this is the big grand assault.
[03:00:37.360 --> 03:00:52.626]  And I would consider everybody again, and this has been said before, so it's again, not a new thing, but I would consider people, um, I would, I would encourage them to think about their ancestors during this entire time.
[03:00:52.626 --> 03:00:54.427]  Our ancestors have passed on.
[03:00:54.427 --> 03:00:56.507]  They can see clearly what's going on.
[03:00:56.507 --> 03:01:00.889]  They didn't create us to just sit around and do nothing.
[03:01:00.889 --> 03:01:03.150]  And given the fact that this is a war.
[03:01:04.085 --> 03:01:11.211]  It's the responsibility of parents to shield their children from the bullets and the gunfire.
[03:01:11.211 --> 03:01:17.475]  They should show them what's going on, and many of them are, and God bless each and every one of them.
[03:01:17.475 --> 03:01:22.419]  But for the ones that are dead asleep, even them hearing this, it's not going to make a dent, maybe.
[03:01:22.419 --> 03:01:23.620]  I don't know.
[03:01:23.620 --> 03:01:31.086]  But they need to shield them from what's taking place, but at the same time educate them about what's taking place.
[03:01:31.889 --> 03:01:35.850]  And I think even Dr. Mike Yeadon said this as well.
[03:01:35.850 --> 03:01:40.311]  He was talking about, look, don't pay attention to your degrees.
[03:01:40.311 --> 03:01:46.752]  Don't pay attention to, well, I'm not going to get my high school diploma on time, quote unquote.
[03:01:46.752 --> 03:01:48.353]  That's gone.
[03:01:48.353 --> 03:01:50.653]  You have to throw that out the window.
[03:01:50.653 --> 03:01:53.574]  You can get a high school diploma anytime you want.
[03:01:54.686 --> 03:02:02.650]  Again, you can homeschool and you can... This is a civilization level design collapse in their own words.
[03:02:02.650 --> 03:02:05.152]  You're right, we're in the middle of a giant war.
[03:02:05.152 --> 03:02:07.873]  All that matters is winning this war right now.
[03:02:07.873 --> 03:02:09.134]  That's right.
[03:02:09.134 --> 03:02:10.514]  That's the way that I see it.
[03:02:10.514 --> 03:02:16.637]  Because again, there are too many people sending their own children into the slaughterhouse, so to speak.
[03:02:16.637 --> 03:02:21.680]  And as it's been said on your show, I'm sure a million times, by the time you smell the blood,
[03:02:22.426 --> 03:02:25.248]  of the sheep in front of you, it's too late.
[03:02:25.248 --> 03:02:28.950]  And again, it's gotten to the point now where, hey look, it's too late.
[03:02:28.950 --> 03:02:41.957]  Now I know it's not happening in every school across America, but goodness gracious, the vice is closing in here, and these private schools and charter schools that aren't doing this can only have so many students.
[03:02:41.957 --> 03:02:45.419]  I mean, they have a cap on their population.
[03:02:45.419 --> 03:02:47.320]  And then the next year, what do you think's going to happen?
[03:02:47.320 --> 03:02:50.742]  Are those students going to leave that school that's been a safe harbor?
[03:02:51.266 --> 03:02:53.308]  During this entire time, no.
[03:02:53.308 --> 03:02:55.209]  They're going to continue to have those students.
[03:02:55.209 --> 03:02:58.632]  They might pick up some more in the grade level below them.
[03:02:58.632 --> 03:03:01.075]  And that will continue, which is a great thing.
[03:03:01.075 --> 03:03:04.037]  But those schools have to multiply.
[03:03:04.037 --> 03:03:11.263]  And mass noncompliance has consistently been said, and I completely agree with it.
[03:03:11.263 --> 03:03:14.306]  More people have to walk out of these schools permanently.
[03:03:14.306 --> 03:03:15.247]  It will shine a light.
[03:03:15.757 --> 03:03:19.058]  On the school board, their actions, everything they're doing.
[03:03:19.058 --> 03:03:28.062]  And that's already happening, as well as, as you said, the colleges, hospitals, and the public schools, the primary schools, there's a giant exodus.
[03:03:28.062 --> 03:03:29.443]  How are they dealing with that?
[03:03:29.443 --> 03:03:32.744]  I guess the bureaucrats don't care because they're still getting their money?
[03:03:32.744 --> 03:03:34.024]  They've gotten their money for the year.
[03:03:34.024 --> 03:03:35.985]  The K-12 schools have gotten their money for the year.
[03:03:35.985 --> 03:03:39.226]  So the time to walk away is now and permanently.
[03:03:39.226 --> 03:03:40.347]  That's the way that I see it.
[03:03:40.347 --> 03:03:44.469]  Because if they leave now and only return in the spring,
[03:03:46.249 --> 03:03:54.018]  And then say, well, we'll come back next fall when you've decided to not be totalitarians, which they're not going to do.
[03:03:54.018 --> 03:03:56.060]  The road has already been crossed there.
[03:03:56.060 --> 03:03:59.104]  So they have to leave and then stay away.
[03:03:59.847 --> 03:04:13.358]  And again, that's a difficult leap for someone and a parent and a family that's been in a pattern of behavior or had a pattern of behavior in their own mind for a very long time that the only way to achieve education... Sure, but folks have to get the social contracts broken.
[03:04:13.358 --> 03:04:15.080]  The more we submit it, only gets worse.
[03:04:15.080 --> 03:04:17.782]  Now we just have to pull out and say no.
[03:04:17.782 --> 03:04:18.983]  That's right.
[03:04:18.983 --> 03:04:22.326]  And online university, online college institutions,
[03:04:22.884 --> 03:04:23.064]  Have you?
[03:04:42.006 --> 03:04:51.489]  As most people are finding out now, you mean I can learn at home, and the computer and learning at home, all of that stuff is propaganda as far as it being bad?
[03:04:51.489 --> 03:04:52.229]  It's not.
[03:04:52.229 --> 03:04:53.809]  Let the mind wander.
[03:04:53.809 --> 03:04:55.430]  Let the mind do what God wants to do.
[03:04:55.430 --> 03:04:58.411]  Well sure, you go to Mainline College, there's not even a professor there, it's just a bunch of zombies.
[03:04:58.411 --> 03:04:59.251]  We'll be right back.
[03:05:00.097 --> 03:05:03.818]  Not all vitamin and mineral supplements are equal.
[03:05:03.818 --> 03:05:04.919]  Many of them are synthetic.
[03:05:04.919 --> 03:05:06.880]  Many of them have fillers and additives.
[03:05:06.880 --> 03:05:09.901]  Many of them just pass right through the body and are not absorbed.
[03:05:09.901 --> 03:05:18.784]  Well, that's not the case with our incredibly popular, because it's so effective, product that has now been sold out for months, but it's finally back in stock.
[03:05:18.784 --> 03:05:21.265]  And that is Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[03:05:21.265 --> 03:05:23.906]  All the essential vitamins, all the essential minerals,
[03:05:24.286 --> 03:05:28.388]  A bunch of key amino acids to help it upload better into your body, into your cells.
[03:05:28.388 --> 03:05:29.328]  It's in powder form.
[03:05:29.328 --> 03:05:30.529]  It's great for children.
[03:05:30.529 --> 03:05:31.469]  It's great for adults.
[03:05:31.469 --> 03:05:36.012]  It's really important for folks that are older, because they don't absorb as well through their gut.
[03:05:36.012 --> 03:05:38.393]  So this liquid formula really, really does.
[03:05:38.393 --> 03:05:43.775]  You can mix up a pitcher of it every couple days, put it in the refrigerator, or keep it out in the kitchen.
[03:05:43.775 --> 03:05:46.176]  And just remember to drink it in the morning and in the evening.
[03:05:46.176 --> 03:05:47.217]  It tastes great.
[03:05:47.217 --> 03:05:48.538]  It makes your body healthy.
[03:05:48.538 --> 03:05:50.238]  It boosts your immune system.
[03:05:50.238 --> 03:05:51.359]  And it funds the
[03:05:51.459 --> 03:05:52.540]  We're good to go.
[03:06:13.806 --> 03:06:16.027]  All right, we've got a jam-packed hour coming up here.
[03:06:16.027 --> 03:06:18.569]  Owen Schroeder joins me in a few minutes.
[03:06:18.569 --> 03:06:22.571]  Let out of federal jail yesterday for being at the Capitol.
[03:06:22.571 --> 03:06:26.634]  They admit didn't commit any crimes, wasn't violent, but they still call that a crime.
[03:06:26.634 --> 03:06:36.600]  Dr. Sean M. Brooks, Ph.D., went super viral, one of the most viral clips coming out of these city council meetings and school board meetings, which everybody should be using as folks are watching these.
[03:06:36.600 --> 03:06:37.881]  It's getting out to a wider audience.
[03:06:37.881 --> 03:06:40.623]  It doesn't matter if the bureaucrats laugh at you, they'll cry later.
[03:06:41.243 --> 03:06:44.245]  But you said you thought you had five minutes, they cut it down to three.
[03:06:44.245 --> 03:06:50.290]  So you got the floor right now to re-give that speech and not be interrupted, not be told 15 seconds.
[03:06:50.290 --> 03:06:57.676]  So you give us the next speech from Dr. Sean M. Brooks, AmericanEducationFM.com.
[03:06:57.676 --> 03:06:58.437]  I appreciate it.
[03:06:58.437 --> 03:07:03.881]  I'm not sure I could repeat it, but I'll certainly bring up a few points that are worth bringing up.
[03:07:03.881 --> 03:07:07.284]  Number one, we all know about the faulty tests.
[03:07:07.284 --> 03:07:09.886]  They're using these faulty tests and they're testing students
[03:07:10.819 --> 03:07:17.144]  Consistently, as they come in, temperature checks XYZ.
[03:07:17.144 --> 03:07:18.865]  All of this is an invasion.
[03:07:18.865 --> 03:07:20.586]  All of this is child abuse.
[03:07:20.586 --> 03:07:24.909]  And people need to, again, they've got to wrap their arms around this.
[03:07:24.909 --> 03:07:26.450]  It's not under the guise of health.
[03:07:26.450 --> 03:07:27.411]  It never has been.
[03:07:27.411 --> 03:07:28.592]  It's child abuse.
[03:07:28.592 --> 03:07:30.413]  That's number one.
[03:07:30.413 --> 03:07:35.877]  Number two, they're using those faulty tests to quarantine students.
[03:07:35.877 --> 03:07:37.078]  They use a faulty test.
[03:07:37.078 --> 03:07:38.519]  They test positive.
[03:07:38.519 --> 03:07:39.520]  They throw them in a
[03:07:40.319 --> 03:07:46.104]  Isolated room by themselves somewhere, which I don't know how schools can accommodate for that.
[03:07:46.104 --> 03:07:49.146]  And then they're calling home and they're saying, well, they tested positive.
[03:07:49.146 --> 03:07:51.127]  You need to come and pick them up.
[03:07:51.127 --> 03:07:54.110]  And then they come and pick them up.
[03:07:54.110 --> 03:08:00.355]  So the parents are being yanked around by a leash regarding all of this on a consistent basis.
[03:08:00.355 --> 03:08:07.400]  It baffles the mind as to why a parent would continue to send their child to an environment that's engaging in such practices.
[03:08:08.294 --> 03:08:12.836]  Um, I would encourage people to look up Ohio House Bill 248.
[03:08:12.836 --> 03:08:20.638]  That's currently being discussed, I believe, on the House floor in Ohio, and it has to do with vaccine rights.
[03:08:20.638 --> 03:08:25.380]  No passports, no mandates, no jabs, right across the board.
[03:08:25.380 --> 03:08:33.123]  I believe it also includes all vaccines so that schools can't in the future say, well, they have to have this and they have to have that.
[03:08:33.123 --> 03:08:36.644]  This notion that the un-vaxxed or the un-jabbed.
[03:08:36.994 --> 03:08:44.597]  would ever make someone ill in a K-12 environment who's taken all of these drugs and these poisons is absurd.
[03:08:44.597 --> 03:08:49.379]  It defies logic as to why that would even be the case.
[03:08:49.379 --> 03:08:54.241]  So again, the quarantining is beyond alarming.
[03:08:54.241 --> 03:09:00.303]  The moment that, you know, I don't have children, but if at the moment that I had heard that
[03:09:01.084 --> 03:09:04.907]  And that being done to one of my own children, that would have been the last straw.
[03:09:04.907 --> 03:09:06.188]  That would have been it.
[03:09:06.188 --> 03:09:08.749]  I would have immediately started to research homeschooling.
[03:09:08.749 --> 03:09:13.873]  And again, countless parents throughout the United States and around the world have done just that.
[03:09:13.873 --> 03:09:26.702]  I would also take it a step further and go back to again what Dr. Mike Eden said, which is you've got to completely shake up your notion of the pragmatic way that things have been done in the past.
[03:09:26.702 --> 03:09:28.403]  It didn't work then.
[03:09:28.403 --> 03:09:30.505]  And we're in war now, which means
[03:09:31.555 --> 03:09:34.437]  Things are not going to be the same, nor should they.
[03:09:34.437 --> 03:09:46.644]  We're evolving to the point where we can become more independent and stop being so reliant on government and the people around us to make our education decisions for us.
[03:09:46.644 --> 03:09:53.547]  We've always known that the Rockefellers and the Carnegies have had everything to do with the K-12 textbook system.
[03:09:53.547 --> 03:09:55.028]  No different in higher ed.
[03:09:55.028 --> 03:09:56.749]  It's the exact same.
[03:09:56.749 --> 03:09:58.190]  They control the information.
[03:09:59.550 --> 03:10:03.132]  They control the minds of those individuals that don't think for themselves.
[03:10:03.132 --> 03:10:09.014]  And again, when I was in college, the books I read were the ones that I went to the bookstore to buy.
[03:10:09.014 --> 03:10:13.816]  They were not the ones that the university said, well, you need to read this and you need to read that.
[03:10:13.816 --> 03:10:18.378]  I'd look at this $300 textbook and say, no, I'm not reading this.
[03:10:18.378 --> 03:10:20.058]  And I'd glance through it.
[03:10:20.058 --> 03:10:21.999]  I'd write a paper for the class and then that'd be it.
[03:10:22.637 --> 03:10:36.866]  And then I'd go to a bookstore, back when bookstores existed, and I would buy two, three, four books about people, history, events, psychology, sociology, anatomy, physiology, and I would put all of this together, and I'd read on my own time.
[03:10:36.866 --> 03:10:40.748]  People have to self-educate, and we have to let children do that.
[03:10:40.748 --> 03:10:42.670]  Well, for those that don't know, Doc...
[03:10:43.610 --> 03:10:49.896]  Up until really the 1850s and stuff, most colleges, you had to come exam to even get in them.
[03:10:49.896 --> 03:10:51.838]  People were self-taught or they apprenticed.
[03:10:51.838 --> 03:10:56.703]  Most lawyers, like Andrew Jackson and others, they just went and apprenticed for two years.
[03:10:56.703 --> 03:10:58.004]  One guy might have to apprentice for ten.
[03:10:58.004 --> 03:10:59.245]  They maybe never got him a law license.
[03:10:59.245 --> 03:10:59.706]  He wasn't good.
[03:11:00.186 --> 03:11:01.986]  Jackson, they said, in two years, you got it.
[03:11:01.986 --> 03:11:04.847]  He was like a judge a few years later because he was competent.
[03:11:04.847 --> 03:11:06.007]  It was the apprentice system.
[03:11:06.007 --> 03:11:07.228]  It was all self-taught.
[03:11:07.228 --> 03:11:09.788]  That's like Benjamin Franklin, one of the smartest guys in history.
[03:11:09.788 --> 03:11:19.270]  Never went to school anywhere, but the guy freaking got all the awards you could get in the world and professorships because he was self-taught and read books 10 hours a day.
[03:11:19.270 --> 03:11:21.491]  And there was no bell.
[03:11:21.491 --> 03:11:25.652]  There was no bell to tell people the learning stops for this subject right now.
[03:11:25.652 --> 03:11:26.992]  See you tomorrow.
[03:11:26.992 --> 03:11:27.732]  It didn't exist.
[03:11:28.396 --> 03:11:35.486]  The Prussian education system is the largest failure that's ever existed in the history of our country as far as education is concerned.
[03:11:35.486 --> 03:11:40.893]  For those that don't know, it was trained to create mindless soldiers and programmable people.
[03:11:40.893 --> 03:11:43.176]  That's the whole modern psychology came out of that.
[03:11:43.176 --> 03:11:44.478]  That is not the American system.
[03:11:45.509 --> 03:11:46.089]  Correct.
[03:11:46.089 --> 03:11:57.093]  And unfortunately, we have a great deal of individuals who have never taught a day in their life commenting on K-12 education haphazardly or just at the surface level without diving in a little bit deeper.
[03:11:57.093 --> 03:12:01.674]  Those same people, unfortunately, are the ones educating the future teachers of America.
[03:12:02.119 --> 03:12:06.102]  And that happens and has been happening now since, well, God knows when.
[03:12:06.102 --> 03:12:07.543]  A very long time.
[03:12:07.543 --> 03:12:09.725]  And that's also problematic.
[03:12:09.725 --> 03:12:15.669]  I mean, I've been shut out of the higher ed institutions and it's not an accident.
[03:12:15.669 --> 03:12:16.990]  I've been writing about... Hey, it doesn't matter.
[03:12:16.990 --> 03:12:20.373]  You're speaking up and you're out there now and you've written books and you're taking action.
[03:12:20.373 --> 03:12:23.135]  Dr. Sean M. Brooks, Ph.D., thank you so much.
[03:12:23.135 --> 03:12:27.938]  We really appreciate your time and great job on your viral interview or your viral speech.
[03:12:27.938 --> 03:12:29.540]  We want to see more of you and have you back on.
[03:12:29.540 --> 03:12:29.860]  Thank you.
[03:12:30.686 --> 03:12:31.527]  I appreciate it, thank you.
[03:12:31.527 --> 03:12:34.389]  Alright, that was powerful.
[03:12:34.389 --> 03:12:37.552]  Speaking of the young people waking up, I've got a bunch of clips I haven't gotten to.
[03:12:37.552 --> 03:12:40.594]  Before we go to break, I'm back with Owen with some breaking news.
[03:12:40.594 --> 03:12:44.597]  UK kid on why he's not getting the so-called vaccine.
[03:12:44.597 --> 03:12:46.719]  This is powerful, here it is.
[03:12:46.719 --> 03:12:52.344]  You're obviously aware of the adverse vaccine reactions, not everyone is, so you don't want to take the vaccine.
[03:12:52.344 --> 03:12:54.305]  What pressure have you had from friends or family?
[03:12:54.305 --> 03:12:59.890]  Because your particular age group have been targeted lately in terms of nightclubs, universities, going on holidays.
[03:13:00.410 --> 03:13:03.533]  So my auntie works for AstraZeneca.
[03:13:03.533 --> 03:13:08.697]  So the pressure from my family, well some of my family, is quite great to get the vaccine.
[03:13:08.697 --> 03:13:11.119]  They're like, why haven't you taken the vaccine?
[03:13:11.119 --> 03:13:12.079]  Why haven't you taken the vaccine?
[03:13:12.079 --> 03:13:12.880]  You're selfish.
[03:13:12.880 --> 03:13:17.824]  My cousin from Cambridge has even called me a twat over it, not getting the vaccine, you know.
[03:13:20.387 --> 03:13:22.850]  I've lost friends over it as well.
[03:13:22.850 --> 03:13:26.733]  There are some friends though who won't take the vaccine no matter what.
[03:13:26.733 --> 03:13:30.117]  And that's because they've seen what it's done to people.
[03:13:30.117 --> 03:13:36.984]  I've got friends who are very ill and haven't been well since the day they took it and have regretted it.
[03:13:36.984 --> 03:13:40.707]  But I've also got friends who are like, well, if you don't take the vaccine, you're going to be killing other people.
[03:13:41.608 --> 03:13:45.249]  If you can still get it when you've got the vaccine, how am I killing other people?
[03:13:45.249 --> 03:13:47.650]  It doesn't prevent transmission because you can still pass it on.
[03:13:47.650 --> 03:13:48.750]  You can still get it.
[03:13:48.750 --> 03:13:49.771]  So how am I killing other people?
[03:13:49.771 --> 03:13:50.491]  I'm not being selfish.
[03:13:50.491 --> 03:13:51.851]  It's my body, my choice.
[03:13:51.851 --> 03:13:53.172]  What's the world looking like for you?
[03:13:53.172 --> 03:14:00.494]  Because, you know, for the younger generations, if this vaccine passports are taken up by the majority, what do you think the world's going to look like in a year?
[03:14:03.044 --> 03:14:05.905]  In a year, I have no idea.
[03:14:05.905 --> 03:14:07.566]  It's straight out of the 1984 book.
[03:14:07.566 --> 03:14:19.311]  The idea that we're going to have to get out our phones and get up our passes, show our papers in the streets, or if we want to go into a pub.
[03:14:19.311 --> 03:14:19.911]  It's funny.
[03:14:19.911 --> 03:14:23.532]  It's honestly funny that people don't see where this is going.
[03:14:23.532 --> 03:14:24.813]  It's about control.
[03:14:27.614 --> 03:14:38.003]  You know, if you allow the government to break the law and to violate your rights because of an emergency, what's stopping them from creating an emergency to break the law?
[03:14:38.003 --> 03:14:42.687]  Good old-fashioned Anglo-Saxon sense just genetically coming out of that young man.
[03:14:42.687 --> 03:14:50.214]  And that's why the system wants to discredit where all the modern freedoms came from, that little island, in the last thousand years.
[03:14:51.271 --> 03:14:59.533]  A lot of great people, a lot of great cultures, but the globalists want to get rid of the Anglo-Saxon idea of freedom because it flies in the face of everything else.
[03:14:59.533 --> 03:15:06.695]  And a lot of the people that, you know, are obsessed with hating Israel and Jews and all that, they're always like, well, there's no Judaic to the Christian.
[03:15:06.695 --> 03:15:07.795]  Well, there really is.
[03:15:07.795 --> 03:15:09.395]  That's what Christianity comes out of.
[03:15:09.395 --> 03:15:15.197]  You can look at bad parts of Judaism, bad parts of Christianity, more modern forms of it or whatever, the case of Judaism.
[03:15:16.958 --> 03:15:18.318]  That's a side issue.
[03:15:18.318 --> 03:15:29.181]  The Jews also did develop due process and some of the things that, when they actually ran into some of the Anglo-Saxon type laws that were already there, the Anglo-Saxons adopted it because it made sense to them.
[03:15:29.181 --> 03:15:31.302]  So they're very similar systems.
[03:15:31.302 --> 03:15:35.983]  And the globalists are getting rid of all of that right now.
[03:15:35.983 --> 03:15:37.464]  They're just trashing it.
[03:15:37.464 --> 03:15:44.245]  They're burning it with classic paganism, which just says, we'll kill whoever we want, we'll do whatever we want, we'll rule everyone.
[03:15:44.245 --> 03:15:45.206]  It's our right to do it.
[03:15:46.391 --> 03:15:49.813]  Alright, Owen Schroyer is out of jail, but he's got a hearing Thursday.
[03:15:49.813 --> 03:15:52.074]  A hanging judge might try to throw him back in.
[03:15:52.074 --> 03:15:53.755]  You've got big updates there.
[03:15:53.755 --> 03:15:55.595]  And did I really come out against Trump?
[03:15:55.595 --> 03:15:57.296]  I'll tell you about that when we come back.
[03:15:57.296 --> 03:15:58.097]  And so much more.
[03:15:58.097 --> 03:15:58.537]  Stay with us.
[03:15:58.996 --> 03:16:05.339]  What if you could cut your heating bills this winter with your existing wood burning fireplace and not spend thousands doing it?

[03:16:29.346 --> 03:16:30.166]  Hey, everybody.
[03:16:30.166 --> 03:16:33.407]  Confused about staying healthy in a crazy COVID culture?
[03:16:33.407 --> 03:16:34.167]  Me too.
[03:16:34.167 --> 03:16:41.268]  But listen, after all the research, all the conflicting studies, after all the squabbling, there's one thing almost everyone agrees on.
[03:16:41.268 --> 03:16:45.669]  It's that immune system health can literally be the difference between life and death.
[03:16:45.669 --> 03:16:47.569]  You probably already believe that.
[03:16:47.569 --> 03:16:48.569]  I certainly do.
[03:16:48.569 --> 03:16:49.510]  So here's the thing.
[03:16:49.510 --> 03:16:57.831]  I wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant-based substances actually have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support.

[03:17:28.151 --> 03:17:30.432]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:17:30.432 --> 03:17:34.354]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:17:34.354 --> 03:17:35.894]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:17:35.894 --> 03:17:38.856]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:17:38.856 --> 03:17:44.058]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:17:44.418 --> 03:17:45.600]  I can help you too.
[03:17:45.600 --> 03:17:48.544]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[03:17:48.544 --> 03:17:50.768]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[03:17:50.768 --> 03:17:55.214]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, DanPilla.com.
[03:17:55.214 --> 03:17:56.917]  That's DanPilla.com.
[03:17:56.917 --> 03:17:57.558]  DanPilla.com.
[03:18:00.052 --> 03:18:03.794]  Not all vitamin and mineral supplements are equal.
[03:18:03.794 --> 03:18:04.894]  Many of them are synthetic.
[03:18:04.894 --> 03:18:06.855]  Many of them have fillers and additives.
[03:18:06.855 --> 03:18:09.837]  Many of them just pass right through the body and are not absorbed.
[03:18:09.837 --> 03:18:18.741]  Well, that's not the case with our incredibly popular, because it's so effective, product that has now been sold out for months, but it's finally back in stock.
[03:18:18.741 --> 03:18:21.223]  And that is Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[03:18:21.223 --> 03:18:23.864]  All the essential vitamins, all the essential minerals,
[03:18:24.224 --> 03:18:28.346]  A bunch of key amino acids to help it upload better into your body and your cells.
[03:18:28.346 --> 03:18:29.327]  It's in powder form.
[03:18:29.327 --> 03:18:30.448]  It's great for children.
[03:18:30.448 --> 03:18:31.428]  It's great for adults.
[03:18:31.428 --> 03:18:35.971]  It's really important for folks that are older because they don't absorb as well through their gut.
[03:18:35.971 --> 03:18:38.352]  So this liquid formula really, really does.
[03:18:38.352 --> 03:18:43.355]  You can mix up a pitcher of it every couple days, put it in the refrigerator, or keep it out in the kitchen.
[03:18:43.735 --> 03:18:46.138]  And just remember to drink it in the morning and in the evening.
[03:18:46.138 --> 03:18:47.159]  It tastes great.
[03:18:47.159 --> 03:18:48.501]  It makes your body healthy.
[03:18:48.501 --> 03:18:50.183]  It boosts your immune system.
[03:18:50.183 --> 03:18:53.267]  And it funds the end of the Cold War.
[03:18:53.267 --> 03:18:53.928]  A true 360 win.
[03:18:53.928 --> 03:18:55.309]  So, Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[03:18:55.309 --> 03:18:56.170]  Sold out for months.
[03:18:56.170 --> 03:18:57.552]  It's back in stock for a limited time.
[03:18:57.552 --> 03:18:59.975]  33% off at infowarestore.com.
[03:18:59.975 --> 03:19:03.339]  Humanity is the main stakeholder on this planet.
[03:19:04.062 --> 03:19:04.643]  We're good to go.
[03:19:21.618 --> 03:19:28.145]  Capturing democracy and taking over governments worldwide to set up a corporate dictatorship under the UN.
[03:19:28.145 --> 03:19:30.427]  They admit all of this.
[03:19:30.427 --> 03:19:31.708]  They plan the lockdowns.
[03:19:31.708 --> 03:19:33.390]  They release the viruses.
[03:19:33.390 --> 03:19:35.112]  They think you're stupid.
[03:19:35.112 --> 03:19:41.218]  And their plan is to slowly cut off the resources so they can dictate total social control over you and your lives.
[03:19:41.798 --> 03:19:52.363]  That's how I was able to predict everything they did decades before they executed it, word for word, with total precision, because they have a detailed battle plan.
[03:19:52.363 --> 03:19:54.084]  We cover it live, weekdays, 11 a.m.
[03:19:54.084 --> 03:19:54.924]  to 3 p.m.
[03:19:54.924 --> 03:19:57.025]  at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[03:19:57.025 --> 03:20:02.767]  Tell everybody to tune in now and warn the world.
[03:20:02.767 --> 03:20:05.409]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:20.290 --> 03:20:23.451]  Look at this headline, InfoWars.com.
[03:20:23.451 --> 03:20:27.632]  Israel to grant green passports only to triple vaccinated.
[03:20:27.632 --> 03:20:39.694]  The state of Israel may soon restrict travel within the country only to people who have received two vaccines, there aren't even vaccines, and a booster shot as deaths and infection rates amongst the fully vaccinated explodes.
[03:20:39.694 --> 03:20:42.235]  90 plus percent now in the hospital have had the shot.
[03:20:42.235 --> 03:20:45.696]  So it's not that it didn't work, it's no, you need more.
[03:20:45.696 --> 03:20:47.156]  That's right, if something doesn't work,
[03:20:47.876 --> 03:20:51.697]  If you poured gasoline on yourself and burned yourself, the answer is more gasoline.
[03:20:51.697 --> 03:20:55.318]  If you cut yourself and it hurt, the answer is cut yourself more.
[03:20:55.318 --> 03:21:01.219]  If you're fat because you eat too much, the answer is eat more, more, more, more.
[03:21:01.219 --> 03:21:02.179]  Owen Troyer's here.
[03:21:02.179 --> 03:21:04.120]  A video is out.
[03:21:04.120 --> 03:21:10.701]  Pfizer's CEO says COVID-19 vaccines resistant variant likely to emerge.
[03:21:10.701 --> 03:21:14.602]  It already has from the people that took the shot and now they admit
[03:21:15.649 --> 03:21:20.733]  Only a 90-something percent efficacy rate in our face.
[03:21:20.733 --> 03:21:28.318]  And Bloomberg tells the world, oh, you're going to have to take monthly shots that totally destroy your immune system.
[03:21:28.318 --> 03:21:31.180]  I mean, the logic is out the window.
[03:21:31.180 --> 03:21:32.281]  It was all premeditated.
[03:21:32.281 --> 03:21:34.302]  We called it over a year and a half ago.
[03:21:34.302 --> 03:21:36.163]  And, Owen, now here we are.
[03:21:36.163 --> 03:21:36.864]  What do you make of this?
[03:21:37.927 --> 03:21:39.809]  Well, there's a lot of analogies you could make.
[03:21:39.809 --> 03:21:47.615]  I mean, I guess this is a little more advanced, like if you're in a sci-fi novel, like a movie, and somebody created some sort of a...
[03:21:48.809 --> 03:21:58.332]  A monster, a human-eating monster that could procreate really fast, and then, oh well, you have to be a slave now because of this monster that procreates really fast and just eats humans and eats human flesh.
[03:21:58.332 --> 03:21:59.593]  Well, you say, who created this?
[03:21:59.593 --> 03:22:01.313]  Who released this on us?
[03:22:01.313 --> 03:22:03.214]  And you wouldn't then go to them for the answer.
[03:22:03.214 --> 03:22:06.855]  You wouldn't then go to them to say, hey, you know, tell me what to do now.
[03:22:06.855 --> 03:22:07.155]  That's right.
[03:22:07.155 --> 03:22:15.238]  The very people that cooked it up, released it, lied about it, and got caught, that make money out of it, who, by the way, said they want to depopulate us, are the ones running it.
[03:22:15.518 --> 03:22:26.602]  It's so frustrating to know all this Alex and you know what's sad is most people just don't have a clue and you're talking about highly educated people that are at the top echelon of their profession.
[03:22:26.602 --> 03:22:27.982]  They just can't believe there's predators.
[03:22:27.982 --> 03:22:37.245]  And they just can't believe that any of this is going on or they just don't pay attention they don't know and it's frustrating for us to just sit here be in the abyss stare into the abyss study the abyss but as follow-up for that
[03:22:37.785 --> 03:22:38.726]  That's what the girls said.
[03:22:38.726 --> 03:22:39.646]  Both her parents died from the shots.
[03:22:39.646 --> 03:22:40.287]  She goes, well it's good.
[03:23:01.343 --> 03:23:10.188]  That's multiple examples now, but there's also a story, this is going to be one of my main stories today, because this is kind of, I think the canary in the coal mine here has to be Israel.
[03:23:10.188 --> 03:23:19.272]  And guys, if you plug in, I don't know if you have the story on your desk, if you just plug in ultra-vaxxed Israel, they're basically admitting now that it's all the vaccinated people that are sick.
[03:23:19.272 --> 03:23:23.755]  Israel is the most, as you just said, it's 90% of the hospitalizations are vaccinated people.
[03:23:23.755 --> 03:23:25.276]  Type it in, ultra-vaxxed Israel.
[03:23:26.096 --> 03:23:30.799]  Israel is the most vaccinated nation on Earth, and it has the most COVID on Earth.
[03:23:30.799 --> 03:23:31.580]  There it is right there.
[03:23:31.580 --> 03:23:32.560]  Ultravaxed Israel Crisis.
[03:23:32.560 --> 03:23:33.141]  And they said it!
[03:23:33.141 --> 03:23:34.221]  It's a warning!
[03:23:34.221 --> 03:23:36.062]  You better take more shots!
[03:23:36.062 --> 03:23:39.625]  They took the most shots, they're the most sick, so you need more!
[03:23:40.382 --> 03:23:43.506]  I can't put the clown world nature of this.
[03:23:43.506 --> 03:23:47.490]  It's like saying if I punched you in the face and it hurt, the answer is you go, hit me more.
[03:23:47.490 --> 03:23:49.673]  They're like, oh, I'm bleeding.
[03:23:49.673 --> 03:23:50.794]  I need stitches now.
[03:23:50.794 --> 03:23:53.117]  Please, you know, you know, give me a brain hemorrhage.
[03:23:53.117 --> 03:23:54.798]  You know, crack my skull.
[03:23:54.798 --> 03:23:55.459]  I want more of it.
[03:23:55.459 --> 03:23:57.021]  I want death.
[03:23:57.021 --> 03:23:57.842]  How can this be?
[03:23:57.842 --> 03:23:58.883]  How can these people?
[03:23:59.924 --> 03:24:02.307]  Actually publish these stories.
[03:24:02.307 --> 03:24:04.889]  How can these people actually have this debate?
[03:24:04.889 --> 03:24:08.533]  But see Alex, that's the ultimate frustration is... Well, exactly.
[03:24:08.533 --> 03:24:11.316]  What is it where they publish stuff where the logic shows it's a fraud?
[03:24:12.443 --> 03:24:15.185]  I mean, but then still, they just do it.
[03:24:15.185 --> 03:24:27.055]  There used to be this thing called debate, and we would have debates over major issues, and then people could be informed, and the public could make informed decisions, and we could have actually logical, reasonable discussions about this.
[03:24:27.055 --> 03:24:28.297]  You don't get to debate anymore.
[03:24:28.297 --> 03:24:33.321]  Instead, everybody's censored off the internet, including prestigious medical facilities that tell the truth.
[03:24:34.761 --> 03:24:50.191]  And you know it kind of in a way I think it goes back to what the doctor said and it kind of reminded me of something that I experienced growing up when I was a young professional how it's this new thing where everything has to be by the system for the system and anything outside of the system or not.
[03:24:50.191 --> 03:24:52.632]  And the system comes down from the Davos Group.
[03:24:52.632 --> 03:24:58.056]  The UN, the corporations say it doesn't matter if it doesn't make sense, it doesn't matter if it's bad, we just do it.
[03:24:58.516 --> 03:25:08.486]  I remember when I first got started in media, specifically at a company that owned a magazine and a talk radio station, and I was a writer at the time, so I thought, okay, maybe I would go that direction.
[03:25:08.486 --> 03:25:12.950]  Ended up getting involved in talk radio and just fell in love, never looked back.
[03:25:12.950 --> 03:25:16.814]  And I remember, by the time I was two years in, by the time I was 22 years old,
[03:25:18.335 --> 03:25:20.817]  23 years old all the top radio hosts in St.
[03:25:20.817 --> 03:25:47.615]  Louis wanted me as their producer they wanted me as their fill-in host and I had to sit there and deal with envy and jealousy and hatred from these guys that have been around 5, 10, 20 years that hated me because I basically just left it but it was a thing it was like look you're good at this and so that they said hey look you're the best at this I want you on the air I want you being my producer it was never it was never like oh I want to get all get one over these people it's just that's how it works like you were saying with um with uh what's his name uh Adams or was it Jackson
[03:25:48.435 --> 03:25:51.496]  Basically was an apprentice for two years and they said, okay, you're a top lawyer.
[03:25:51.496 --> 03:25:52.657]  That was Andrew Jackson.
[03:25:52.657 --> 03:25:54.057]  Yeah, so I mean, that's what it is.
[03:25:54.057 --> 03:25:56.658]  It's just, hey, look, you want to win.
[03:25:56.658 --> 03:25:58.379]  I want to win.
[03:25:58.379 --> 03:25:59.219]  I want the best.
[03:25:59.219 --> 03:26:00.099]  I want the smartest.
[03:26:00.099 --> 03:26:01.720]  That's not a slight on people.
[03:26:01.720 --> 03:26:03.000]  That's just human nature.
[03:26:03.000 --> 03:26:04.121]  But that's what made America.
[03:26:04.801 --> 03:26:09.463]  I mean, like, take Admiral Nimbus became the big top admiral and did a great job in World War II.
[03:26:09.463 --> 03:26:11.724]  He literally was never even in the Navy.
[03:26:11.724 --> 03:26:14.666]  The family from Fredericksburg, but he did a great job.
[03:26:14.666 --> 03:26:18.848]  They advanced him, not because he was from an elite family, but because he was a really good seaman.
[03:26:18.848 --> 03:26:20.269]  But nowadays that's not how it works.
[03:26:20.269 --> 03:26:22.990]  They just appoint all their kids and they're a bunch of idiots.
[03:26:23.735 --> 03:26:27.477]  And then, you know, as you've always said, the rising tide raises all ships.
[03:26:27.477 --> 03:26:30.538]  So you want, I've always been like you, I want to see other people successful.
[03:26:30.538 --> 03:26:31.398]  That brings me up.
[03:26:31.398 --> 03:26:33.099]  I'm like, yeah, like be successful.
[03:26:33.099 --> 03:26:34.500]  Hey, let me help you be successful.
[03:26:34.500 --> 03:26:36.161]  Then you can kind of pay it forward.
[03:26:36.161 --> 03:26:42.263]  But you know, there was a, there was a statement that came out of the state department today and they posted it on their social media.
[03:26:42.263 --> 03:26:44.524]  And I don't know if anybody covered it as far as a news story.
[03:26:44.524 --> 03:26:45.245]  And they say, Oh,
[03:26:46.840 --> 03:27:00.153]  Diversity is America's strength, and it shows about all these different Olympic athletes, and there's Asian Americans, Black Americans, White Americans, Brown Americans, all this stuff, and they're like, see, this is why diversity's so good.
[03:27:00.153 --> 03:27:01.915]  And you're completely missing the picture.
[03:27:01.915 --> 03:27:03.436]  It's a complete swing and a miss.
[03:27:03.436 --> 03:27:04.497]  Like, not even close.
[03:27:04.497 --> 03:27:10.303]  Like, the curveball is in the dirt, like it bounced before the plate, and you swung for the fences, not even close.
[03:27:10.743 --> 03:27:13.044]  No, freedom is what did it!
[03:27:13.044 --> 03:27:18.287]  It has nothing to do with skin color, or race, or background.
[03:27:18.287 --> 03:27:20.008]  It's freedom!
[03:27:20.008 --> 03:27:21.789]  Freedom is our strength!
[03:27:21.789 --> 03:27:27.832]  That's why anybody of any skin color, of any whatever, can come here and be successful!
[03:27:27.832 --> 03:27:29.193]  It's freedom!
[03:27:29.193 --> 03:27:30.353]  It's freedom, Alex!
[03:27:30.353 --> 03:27:31.254]  It's freedom, America!
[03:27:31.254 --> 03:27:37.197]  Instead, they want to make it all what group you're in, so that you control the group leaders, and so you don't have an identity.
[03:27:37.197 --> 03:27:39.438]  You simply follow the identity they put out and they demand.
[03:27:39.958 --> 03:27:42.680]  So what do you make of what we thought?
[03:27:42.680 --> 03:27:45.762]  Oh sorry, there'll be new variants, you need monthly shots.
[03:27:45.762 --> 03:27:46.543]  We knew that was coming.
[03:27:48.055 --> 03:27:49.996]  It's just another element of the clown world, Alex.
[03:27:49.996 --> 03:27:52.857]  I mean, you cannot make sense of it.
[03:27:52.857 --> 03:27:54.038]  It's nonsensical.
[03:27:54.038 --> 03:27:58.019]  You just have to sit here and say, we're in the end times.
[03:27:58.019 --> 03:28:00.100]  The Bible warned us about this.
[03:28:00.100 --> 03:28:01.200]  I don't want to admit it.
[03:28:01.200 --> 03:28:03.361]  I don't want to think that hell is about to rain down.
[03:28:03.361 --> 03:28:06.523]  I don't want to think we're about to see an apocalypse here, but I mean, good Lord!
[03:28:06.523 --> 03:28:07.723]  The vaccines are killing people.
[03:28:07.723 --> 03:28:08.964]  They say it's safe and effective.
[03:28:08.964 --> 03:28:10.544]  They admit the vaccine isn't effective.
[03:28:10.544 --> 03:28:11.705]  They say you need to take three.
[03:28:12.205 --> 03:28:27.411]  They just announced today, I have the document on my desk, I'm going to cover it on The War Room, the FDA put out their document where they're saying, oh, we're approving the vaccines, just like we, I mean, I sat right here at this desk with Alex Jones a month ago and we said, in one month, they're going to mandate the vaccines because they know that the FDA approval is coming.
[03:28:27.411 --> 03:28:28.812]  Boom, just like that, it happened.
[03:28:28.812 --> 03:28:35.915]  But, oh, Alex, when do you think the FDA is going to be releasing their studies on these vaccines?
[03:28:36.775 --> 03:28:37.556]  Years from now.
[03:28:37.556 --> 03:28:38.236]  Years from now.
[03:28:38.236 --> 03:28:41.918]  In fact, I believe the earliest is 2023 through 2025.
[03:28:41.918 --> 03:28:44.059]  So, they haven't done the trials.
[03:28:44.059 --> 03:28:46.280]  You're the trial right now.
[03:28:46.280 --> 03:28:48.661]  Tens of thousands of people are dying.
[03:28:48.661 --> 03:28:49.822]  And they're not going to mandate this.
[03:28:49.822 --> 03:28:52.123]  It's all because they already secretly pre-tested it.
[03:28:52.123 --> 03:28:53.183]  It's a kill weapon.
[03:28:53.183 --> 03:28:55.605]  Let's come back and talk about Trump and a lot more.
[03:28:55.605 --> 03:28:56.065]  Stay with us.
[03:28:59.332 --> 03:29:08.375]  You know, listeners call into the show and they thank me, and it makes me feel pathetic, because I sit there and I beg you for support, constantly.
[03:29:08.375 --> 03:29:11.676]  For prayer, for financial support, and for word of mouth.
[03:29:11.676 --> 03:29:13.117]  And we're all in this together.
[03:29:13.117 --> 03:29:18.458]  And it gets old having to come to you and say, hey, I've got great products, please buy them or we won't be here on air.
[03:29:18.458 --> 03:29:19.159]  But it's true.
[03:29:19.159 --> 03:29:22.560]  We're the only media organization in the United States that promotes liberty at this level.
[03:29:23.300 --> 03:29:25.781]  That is not beholden to the big corporate sponsors.
[03:29:25.781 --> 03:29:27.842]  And they've harassed and almost shut down everybody else.
[03:29:27.842 --> 03:29:29.623]  They've crippled all the other groups.
[03:29:29.623 --> 03:29:30.484]  And we're still here.
[03:29:30.484 --> 03:29:34.906]  And as this whole New World Order comes out in the open, our credibility is going up.
[03:29:34.906 --> 03:29:36.547]  That's why we've got to be taken off air.
[03:29:36.547 --> 03:29:38.668]  That's why America has got to be taken down.
[03:29:38.668 --> 03:29:42.470]  You can't have all these other nations enslaved and America still quasi-free.
[03:29:43.070 --> 03:29:44.151]  You can't have InfoWars.
[03:29:44.151 --> 03:29:48.172]  It's been proven right, being on air, with all the craziness that's about to unfold.
[03:29:48.172 --> 03:29:50.293]  Because if you think stuff's bad now, just get ready.
[03:29:50.293 --> 03:29:52.994]  So thank you all, and get into InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:29:52.994 --> 03:29:56.436]  Get some great 2020 election shirts, supplements, and so much more.
[03:29:56.436 --> 03:29:58.177]  They're wonderful products, and they support the InfoWars.
[03:29:58.177 --> 03:29:58.437]  Thank you.
[03:29:59.912 --> 03:30:03.457]  So when I first started taking Survival Shield, basically I was 275 pounds.
[03:30:03.457 --> 03:30:04.979]  I was overweight.
[03:30:04.979 --> 03:30:07.242]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe.
[03:30:07.242 --> 03:30:09.164]  I was barely holding on to a job.
[03:30:09.164 --> 03:30:11.648]  And I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it.
[03:30:11.648 --> 03:30:14.391]  So the first one I got was the original Survival Shield, the X1.
[03:30:14.952 --> 03:30:16.193]  And it worked pretty good.
[03:30:16.193 --> 03:30:21.595]  And then shortly thereafter, you came out with F2, you know, with a deeper source, you know, and I got really excited about that.
[03:30:21.595 --> 03:30:22.235]  So I took it.
[03:30:22.235 --> 03:30:28.538]  And man, in two weeks, I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened.
[03:30:28.538 --> 03:30:31.820]  You know, I could think again, I could connect with people again.
[03:30:31.820 --> 03:30:38.182]  And over the course of the next couple of years, I got my health back and I religiously take basically all of your supplements.
[03:30:38.182 --> 03:30:40.564]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[03:30:40.564 --> 03:30:41.664]  The one I like recently
[03:30:41.904 --> 03:30:43.026]  Beautifully said, brother.
[03:30:43.026 --> 03:30:45.069]  I thank you so much for your call, and Godspeed.
[03:30:59.588 --> 03:31:07.092]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone from beta testing to operational.
[03:31:07.092 --> 03:31:12.614]  The globalists are out in the open with their planetary depopulation takeover, their robot takeover.
[03:31:12.614 --> 03:31:20.178]  But the good news is we've been working and you've been working and others have been working across the planet for decades to get ready for this, to be able to fight it off.
[03:31:20.478 --> 03:31:21.939]  Humanity is strong.
[03:31:21.939 --> 03:31:22.899]  We're incredible.
[03:31:22.899 --> 03:31:26.681]  And if we're aware of the attack that's happening, we have a real chance of defeating it.
[03:31:26.681 --> 03:31:29.142]  If we ask God for guidance, we will defeat it.
[03:31:29.142 --> 03:31:35.485]  So prayer is essential, research is essential, getting prepared is essential, and warning others is absolutely essential.
[03:31:35.485 --> 03:31:44.829]  At the same time, supporting InfoWars by buying high quality products to keep us on air is essential because they're great products for you and your family, and they're also funding our operation.
[03:31:45.149 --> 03:31:47.472]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:31:47.472 --> 03:31:50.135]  InfoWarsStore.com is incredible.
[03:31:50.135 --> 03:31:55.441]  A lot of our products that have been sold out because of supply chain breakdowns are back in, like bodies, bazzo beats, and others.
[03:31:55.441 --> 03:31:59.425]  So get them today at InfoWarsStore.com, and I thank you for being part of the resistance.
[03:32:00.157 --> 03:32:03.878]  Not all vitamin and mineral supplements are equal.
[03:32:03.878 --> 03:32:04.979]  Many of them are synthetic.
[03:32:04.979 --> 03:32:06.939]  Many of them have fillers and additives.
[03:32:06.939 --> 03:32:09.940]  Many of them just pass right through the body and are not absorbed.
[03:32:09.940 --> 03:32:18.263]  Well, that's not the case with our incredibly popular, because it's so effective, product that has now been sold out for months, but it's finally back in stock.
[03:32:18.923 --> 03:32:20.545]  We're good to go.
[03:32:34.037 --> 03:32:38.561]  Because they don't absorb as well through their guts, so this liquid formula really, really does it.
[03:32:38.561 --> 03:32:46.247]  You mix up a pitcher of it every couple days, put it in the refrigerator, or keep it out in the kitchen, and just remember to drink it in the morning and in the evening.
[03:32:46.247 --> 03:32:52.452]  It tastes great, it makes your body healthy, it boosts your immune system, and it funds the InfoWar.
[03:32:52.452 --> 03:32:53.553]  A true 360 win.
[03:32:53.553 --> 03:32:58.017]  So Vitamin Mineral Fusion, sold out for months, is back in stock for a limited time.
[03:32:58.017 --> 03:32:59.538]  It's 33% off InfoWarStore.com.
[03:33:02.699 --> 03:33:14.343]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:14.343 --> 03:33:16.004]  Welcome back.
[03:33:16.004 --> 03:33:19.065]  There's a man going around taking names.
[03:33:19.065 --> 03:33:27.408]  Well, there's the headline, from RT, and it's in London Telegraph, the BBC, the New York Times, Washington Post.
[03:33:27.408 --> 03:33:29.469]  It's in hundreds, if not thousands of publications.
[03:33:30.336 --> 03:33:38.241]  Frustrated Alex Jones calls Donald Trump a dumbass after he recommends taking COVID vaccines.
[03:33:38.241 --> 03:33:39.582]  Well, let's unpack that.
[03:33:39.582 --> 03:33:40.602]  It's not a vaccine.
[03:33:40.602 --> 03:33:42.704]  It's a gene therapy.
[03:33:42.704 --> 03:33:43.985]  It was never authorized.
[03:33:43.985 --> 03:33:48.487]  Now they've skipped the trials and criminally authorized it.
[03:33:48.487 --> 03:33:50.689]  And Trump says in the speech,
[03:33:52.056 --> 03:33:54.377]  Where he was booed that it works.
[03:33:54.377 --> 03:33:57.117]  Well, I've got the article here out of Forbes.
[03:33:57.117 --> 03:34:02.939]  Pfizer's shot just says 39% effective.
[03:34:02.939 --> 03:34:10.080]  And here's the CEO of Pfizer saying, oh, it's not really effective, but don't worry, we have more shots that aren't effective.
[03:34:10.080 --> 03:34:12.521]  So, here's the deal.
[03:34:12.521 --> 03:34:14.721]  I like Trump, the globalist one after him.
[03:34:14.721 --> 03:34:16.702]  He wanted to control the borders, wanted to stand up to China.
[03:34:17.605 --> 03:34:19.426]  But he can't admit when he's wrong.
[03:34:19.426 --> 03:34:21.388]  And so I said, is he evil?
[03:34:21.388 --> 03:34:22.409]  Does he know he's lying?
[03:34:22.409 --> 03:34:25.611]  I think he's smart.
[03:34:25.611 --> 03:34:27.652]  But maybe he is a dumbass.
[03:34:27.652 --> 03:34:31.836]  So I didn't call Trump a dumbass, and I'm not backtracking from what I said.
[03:34:31.836 --> 03:34:33.977]  The media just edits the quote.
[03:34:33.977 --> 03:34:35.959]  I said, I think he's really smart.
[03:34:37.011 --> 03:34:37.852]  So is he evil?
[03:34:37.852 --> 03:34:39.633]  Why would he lie to us like this?
[03:34:39.633 --> 03:34:41.634]  Or maybe he is just a dumbass.
[03:34:41.634 --> 03:34:42.755]  That's really a question, Owen.
[03:34:42.755 --> 03:34:44.336]  I'm not saying he's a dumbass.
[03:34:44.336 --> 03:34:46.518]  I'm saying this is a big problem.
[03:34:46.518 --> 03:34:58.306]  Well, and there's a image from that rally when he mentions the vaccine, and I think it's kind of powerful, where he's like, oh, I got the vaccine, and when he reaches and grabs on, he kind of makes a pain face like this.
[03:34:58.306 --> 03:35:01.569]  And when you freeze frame it, to me, that image is very powerful, because that's what it is.
[03:35:01.569 --> 03:35:03.250]  It's, uh, it's the globalist, uh,
[03:35:03.550 --> 03:35:04.651]  It's the globalist poison.
[03:35:04.651 --> 03:35:06.692]  It's the medical tyranny.
[03:35:06.692 --> 03:35:08.493]  It's, oh, you know, like you're getting the pain.
[03:35:08.493 --> 03:35:09.414]  Like, yeah, this hurts.
[03:35:09.414 --> 03:35:11.315]  This medical tyranny hurts, man.
[03:35:11.315 --> 03:35:11.975]  It's not good.
[03:35:11.975 --> 03:35:13.956]  So I don't know if he maybe did that intentionally.
[03:35:13.956 --> 03:35:14.397]  I don't think.
[03:35:14.397 --> 03:35:16.298]  But I think that that was a powerful image from that.
[03:35:17.814 --> 03:35:26.198]  And it was definitely a dumbass move to promote it to his base that he should have known was not going to take that very well.
[03:35:26.198 --> 03:35:34.142]  And then you had Mike Pence and I think this really tells the story and maybe it's this political hubris but Mike Pence put out a statement.
[03:35:34.662 --> 03:35:45.070]  Basically talking about how great it is that the vaccines have been approved by the FDA, how great the vaccine operation warp speed has been, and then of course he takes credit for it with Trump.
[03:35:45.070 --> 03:35:46.492]  He says, yes, me and Trump did this.
[03:35:46.492 --> 03:35:48.473]  You can thank us, basically.
[03:35:48.473 --> 03:35:53.657]  And they don't understand that it's their very base that is the 50% that is refusing vaccine.
[03:35:53.657 --> 03:35:55.259]  Oh, but they do.
[03:35:55.259 --> 03:35:56.940]  This is an establishment move.
[03:35:56.940 --> 03:35:59.002]  Pence does it because he's an establishment guy.
[03:35:59.002 --> 03:36:02.825]  Trump does it because he's proud of it and thinks he's going to be blamed if it's wrong.
[03:36:03.567 --> 03:36:12.973]  And I think that there's still a little bit of... I mean, I gotta tell you, Alex, I'm not denying that immunization works.
[03:36:12.973 --> 03:36:14.994]  Natural immunity is the best.
[03:36:14.994 --> 03:36:18.677]  I'm not gonna deny that there's science behind vaccines.
[03:36:18.677 --> 03:36:20.578]  It's my personal choice not to get it.
[03:36:20.578 --> 03:36:30.204]  But I gotta tell you, I mean, seeing all the lies that they've told us about COVID, I mean, I'm looking back on all of this stuff and I'm like, maybe we should have never been afraid of any of it.
[03:36:30.204 --> 03:36:31.044]  Well, that's the thing.
[03:36:31.044 --> 03:36:31.625]  This is not...
[03:36:32.972 --> 03:36:37.156]  A classic inoculation, and all the problems with the former ones, and all the scandals.
[03:36:37.156 --> 03:36:39.758]  Act like it's just been some wondrous story.
[03:36:39.758 --> 03:36:41.579]  Guys, get the Brian Williams clip ready.
[03:36:41.579 --> 03:36:44.062]  I saw some TikTok video somebody sent me.
[03:36:44.062 --> 03:36:47.585]  It's got a bunch of weird stuff the kids put on there, but that's all.
[03:36:47.585 --> 03:36:51.108]  Brian Williams, who says he was shot down in a helicopter.
[03:36:51.108 --> 03:36:53.189]  The RPG hit it, they crashed.
[03:36:53.189 --> 03:36:54.250]  Nobody was shot at.
[03:36:54.250 --> 03:36:55.611]  No helicopters got shot at.
[03:36:55.611 --> 03:36:56.873]  It's a lie.
[03:36:56.873 --> 03:36:59.495]  Brian Williams, who's the NBC fact checker.
[03:36:59.495 --> 03:37:00.536]  That'd be like, again, having
[03:37:01.826 --> 03:37:04.547]  A convicted pedophile, run your preschool.
[03:37:04.547 --> 03:37:07.549]  It's the equivalent of having this guy as your fact checker.
[03:37:07.549 --> 03:37:08.910]  He brings up Sandy Hook.
[03:37:08.910 --> 03:37:11.391]  Like, oh, we talk about Sandy Hook so much.
[03:37:11.391 --> 03:37:13.572]  Something I've talked about like 15 times.
[03:37:13.572 --> 03:37:15.913]  Six, seven, eight years ago, the internet questioned it.
[03:37:15.913 --> 03:37:16.794]  I questioned it.
[03:37:16.794 --> 03:37:23.077]  And so they attach my identity to that and always go, oh, Jones said the mass shooting didn't happen.
[03:37:23.077 --> 03:37:24.337]  Well, was Smollett.
[03:37:26.581 --> 03:37:27.861]  Fake is hanging.
[03:37:27.861 --> 03:37:31.582]  Did they fake babies and incubators to start the Iraq War?
[03:37:31.582 --> 03:37:41.664]  Did ABC News show footage at the Knob Creek machine gun shootout and say it was people blowing up villages in Syria?
[03:37:41.664 --> 03:37:44.184]  The point is, yes, we all have a right to question things.
[03:37:44.184 --> 03:37:45.165]  That's our free speech.
[03:37:45.165 --> 03:37:49.565]  I've gotten a few things wrong, not on purpose, unlike Brian Williams.
[03:37:49.565 --> 03:37:52.106]  Did I ever get up there and say I was shot down in a helicopter?
[03:37:53.234 --> 03:37:55.736]  Did I say I was a hero that an RPG hit my helicopter?
[03:37:55.736 --> 03:37:56.577]  No, I didn't.
[03:37:56.577 --> 03:38:05.206]  So, here he is, this criminal slimebag, sitting there, gloating over, oh, Jones has attacked Trump.
[03:38:05.206 --> 03:38:11.652]  And then he acts like it's something new, that Roger Stone doesn't like Steve Bannon when Steve Bannon testified against him.
[03:38:11.652 --> 03:38:12.313]  I'm staying out of it.
[03:38:12.893 --> 03:38:13.914]  I like the work of Steve Bannon.
[03:38:13.914 --> 03:38:15.675]  I think he's a really smart guy.
[03:38:15.675 --> 03:38:17.456]  And I'm friends with Roger, too.
[03:38:17.456 --> 03:38:18.316]  I just want to stay out of it.
[03:38:18.316 --> 03:38:23.079]  But the point is, this is them gleefully, him closing out NBC News last night.
[03:38:24.153 --> 03:38:28.834]  Last thing before we go tonight, as someone put it on Twitter today, the rats are eating each other.
[03:38:28.834 --> 03:38:30.915]  Let's explain, and here's what we mean.
[03:38:30.915 --> 03:38:51.620]  Alex Jones, who sits at the very top of the conspiracy theory aristocracy in the United States, Alex Jones of Infowars, a platinum status anti-vaxxer, appears to have turned on Donald Trump, who this weekend, as we showed you in Alabama, gave the most cursory endorsement of the vaccine.
[03:38:53.962 --> 03:38:57.988]  They didn't create a vaccine, they created a frankenstein!
[03:38:57.988 --> 03:39:00.631]  And now they've got you signed up to it!
[03:39:00.631 --> 03:39:03.475]  Now the left says you better get out there and push it, and you are!
[03:39:03.475 --> 03:39:06.920]  CNN comes out and says, we need to see Trump come out and double hit the shots!
[03:39:06.920 --> 03:39:10.886]  And within weeks of them saying it over and over again, CNN snaps their fingers!
[03:39:11.809 --> 03:39:19.154]  Jeff Zucker snaps his fingers and Trump clicks his heels and hops up there at attention and says, how high do you want me to jump, boss?
[03:39:19.154 --> 03:39:20.915]  Shame on you, Trump.
[03:39:20.915 --> 03:39:25.859]  Seriously, hey, if you don't have the good sense to save yourself and your political career, that's OK.
[03:39:25.859 --> 03:39:28.100]  At least you're going to get some good Republicans elected.
[03:39:28.100 --> 03:39:29.381]  And, you know, we like you.
[03:39:29.381 --> 03:39:31.703]  But my God, maybe you're not that bright.
[03:39:31.703 --> 03:39:32.984]  Maybe Trump's actually a dumbass.
[03:39:35.632 --> 03:39:48.520]  So, when you've lost Alex Jones, you've lost the man who said the parents of the dead children at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut were crisis actors, and that the whole thing was staged by the federal government.
[03:39:48.520 --> 03:39:52.183]  And quote the late Ron Popeil here, but wait, there's more.
[03:39:52.723 --> 03:39:56.264]  Roger Stone has turned on Steve Bannon.
[03:39:56.264 --> 03:39:58.645]  You might want to pull up a chair for this one.
[03:39:58.645 --> 03:40:09.588]  Roger Stone wrote this on Friday, complete with some typos that you'll see, and we quote, Robert Mueller informant and perjurer, Steve Bannon doesn't know his ass from his elbow.
[03:40:09.588 --> 03:40:13.570]  Steve didn't make money on Wall Street, nor did he make money in Hollywood.
[03:40:13.570 --> 03:40:20.252]  He's a grifter, a fat, ugly, inarticulate, poorly groomed alcoholic with delusions of grandeur.
[03:40:20.812 --> 03:40:29.857]  He has never elected anybody to any public office in his life, most particularly not Donald Trump, who is his own man and implemented his own strategy.
[03:40:29.857 --> 03:40:36.961]  Despite being an informant for Robert Mueller, they indicted him anyway, and he will soon be recharged in New York on new charges.
[03:40:36.961 --> 03:40:43.024]  You'll see me as his trial in the front row, and I will not leave until he is convicted and jailed.
[03:40:45.856 --> 03:40:48.597]  So there they are, gleefully, like we're fighting with each other.
[03:40:48.597 --> 03:40:50.937]  And here's the deal, we're not the cult.
[03:40:50.937 --> 03:40:51.737]  Exactly.
[03:40:51.737 --> 03:40:54.118]  We're free Americans that debate and have different ideas.
[03:40:54.118 --> 03:40:57.018]  Well, I was going to say, if anything, I think that that clip would make you look good.
[03:40:57.018 --> 03:40:58.599]  I mean, I guess I shouldn't be surprised by it.
[03:40:58.599 --> 03:41:03.640]  I think I counted just five or six blatant lies, Brian Williams.
[03:41:03.640 --> 03:41:05.360]  I mean, just flat out lies.
[03:41:05.360 --> 03:41:06.921]  I mean, can you imagine?
[03:41:06.921 --> 03:41:12.802]  Like, you know, sometimes the crew will sit there and, you know, you'll go on a great rant or something, or I'll go on a great rant and say, hey, you know, that was good.
[03:41:12.802 --> 03:41:13.142]  Good job.
[03:41:13.142 --> 03:41:13.642]  That was powerful.
[03:41:14.022 --> 03:41:19.788]  Imagine the crew behind Brian Williams like, wow, this guy can just go on TV and lie like nobody's business.
[03:41:19.788 --> 03:41:23.812]  I mean, wow, he just went up there and just said a flat out lie like, hey, good job, Brian.
[03:41:23.812 --> 03:41:25.233]  Way to lie to the whole world.
[03:41:25.233 --> 03:41:26.054]  Like, that's impressive.
[03:41:26.054 --> 03:41:27.615]  What were a few of the lies?
[03:41:27.615 --> 03:41:27.996]  I don't know.
[03:41:27.996 --> 03:41:31.839]  I mean, everything he said pretty much was a complete lie.
[03:41:31.839 --> 03:41:34.002]  But again, how do they sit here and say,
[03:41:35.086 --> 03:41:36.127]  You're in a cult.
[03:41:36.127 --> 03:41:37.348]  You know, you're this, you're that.
[03:41:37.348 --> 03:41:39.410]  You're controlled by this, you're controlled by that.
[03:41:39.410 --> 03:41:41.571]  We just go with wherever reality goes.
[03:41:41.571 --> 03:41:43.053]  We just go wherever the truth goes.
[03:41:43.053 --> 03:41:44.614]  We just go wherever justice goes.
[03:41:44.614 --> 03:41:45.855]  If Trump is right, Trump is right.
[03:41:45.855 --> 03:41:47.136]  If Trump is wrong, Trump is wrong.
[03:41:47.136 --> 03:41:49.518]  If Bill Maher is right, Bill Maher is right!
[03:41:49.518 --> 03:41:51.500]  You know, we'll always give credit where credit is due.
[03:41:51.500 --> 03:41:54.943]  I think I got another video of somebody who I don't... Oh yeah, Spike Lee!
[03:41:54.943 --> 03:41:55.523]  Spike Lee!
[03:41:55.523 --> 03:41:57.044]  I'm no fan of Spike Lee!
[03:41:57.044 --> 03:41:59.827]  I believe Spike Lee... But now he's gonna do 9-11's an inside job.
[03:42:00.247 --> 03:42:00.747]  Good!
[03:42:00.747 --> 03:42:01.528]  Good, Spike Lee!
[03:42:01.528 --> 03:42:02.988]  Expose 9-11, please!
[03:42:02.988 --> 03:42:06.150]  He's a day late and about 20 years short, but at least he's doing it.
[03:42:06.150 --> 03:42:07.651]  So that's what I'm saying.
[03:42:07.651 --> 03:42:10.052]  Hey, if the guy's right, then the guy's right.
[03:42:10.052 --> 03:42:14.954]  I may not like him, I may not agree with him, barely ever, but hey, if he's going to... Good point.
[03:42:14.954 --> 03:42:16.715]  You can see that's what I was going to say about it.
[03:42:16.715 --> 03:42:18.156]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[03:42:18.156 --> 03:42:21.978]  Hollywood director Spike Lee says he had questions about investigation of 9-11 attacks.
[03:42:23.012 --> 03:42:24.433]  We're going to come back in the final segment.
[03:42:24.433 --> 03:42:30.656]  Owen, you were given some rules not to talk with other January 6th people about what happened.
[03:42:30.656 --> 03:42:38.360]  I don't know how they do that when you're a talk show host and I'm a talk show host, but it's all on document cam, it's all on body cam, it's all on video.
[03:42:38.360 --> 03:42:45.324]  So we're not talking about what happened on January 6th, getting our story straight here, when our story is just the truth.
[03:42:45.324 --> 03:42:48.086]  But I want to know how jail went yesterday and the court case.
[03:42:48.086 --> 03:42:50.207]  Folks want to know about that.
[03:42:50.207 --> 03:42:51.148]  So we'll discuss it all.
[03:42:52.398 --> 03:42:54.341]  On the other side, and a lot more.
[03:42:54.341 --> 03:42:55.363]  Final segment straight ahead.
[03:42:58.612 --> 03:43:07.098]  We here at InfoWars are proud to announce the first ever Kava Kava Root Supplement that is now available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:43:07.098 --> 03:43:17.624]  Kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs in the natural health world today, though it has been used for hundreds of years in the Pacific Islands for its relaxation and euphoric effects.
[03:43:17.624 --> 03:43:27.291]  According to ancient Samoan legend, Kava was given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa, who they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe.
[03:43:27.631 --> 03:43:33.593]  The Samoan people would drink kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to loosen up a little.
[03:43:33.593 --> 03:43:38.434]  Nowadays, kava is used around the world by many who enjoy its serious benefits.
[03:43:38.434 --> 03:43:46.637]  The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend of not only kava kava, but other herbs including, but not limited to,
[03:43:47.037 --> 03:43:49.259]  Let's go to Juan in Connecticut.
[03:43:49.259 --> 03:43:50.480]  You're on the air.
[03:43:50.480 --> 03:43:51.441]  Thanks for holding.
[03:44:03.706 --> 03:44:04.346]  I sure can, sir.
[03:44:04.346 --> 03:44:04.687]  Thank you.
[03:44:04.687 --> 03:44:05.407]  Hey, Alex.
[03:44:05.407 --> 03:44:11.631]  Before I start, man, I just wanted to talk to you, bro, and it's a pleasure to be talking right now with you, man.
[03:44:11.631 --> 03:44:12.992]  Sure, it's an honor to talk to you, brother.
[03:44:12.992 --> 03:44:17.114]  I'm from New Brink, Connecticut, and I just want to plug in.
[03:44:17.114 --> 03:44:21.537]  I'm a truck driver, and Turbo Force has changed the way I drive.
[03:44:21.537 --> 03:44:24.479]  Me and my brothers that drive, there's a couple of us.
[03:44:24.479 --> 03:44:25.980]  We're all Hispanics, Cubans.
[03:44:27.741 --> 03:44:42.594]  Well, brother, we put more in this than any other long-term, high-quality energy powder there is.
[03:44:42.594 --> 03:44:44.896]  So this was designed by one of the top guys in the country.
[03:44:44.896 --> 03:44:47.338]  He didn't want his name on it because, obviously, the political issues.
[03:44:47.338 --> 03:44:50.020]  But we had to pay a lot of money for this formulation just for the design of it.
[03:44:50.020 --> 03:44:53.924]  And we believe it is the best, strongest, but healthiest energy out there.
[03:44:54.304 --> 03:44:56.568]  You're saying that it's made your life better, so that means a lot to me.
[03:44:56.568 --> 03:44:56.909]  Thank you.
[03:44:56.909 --> 03:44:58.331]  To all your truck drivers, we love you.
[03:44:59.878 --> 03:45:07.164]  The BioPros are the new non-GMO pollution solution, using eco-friendly products to treat everyday problems while supporting our environment.
[03:45:07.164 --> 03:45:13.969]  For the first time, the BioPros are bringing to the public market a suite of bioremediation products to the everyday consumer.
[03:45:13.969 --> 03:45:20.975]  Their first product they are launching is called BioSeptic Pro, a product specifically designed to establish a healthy septic system.
[03:45:20.975 --> 03:45:25.798]  BioSeptic Pro contains live microorganisms, not traditional enzymes like its competitors.
[03:45:25.798 --> 03:45:27.760]  This stuff lives in your septic system.
[03:45:27.760 --> 03:45:28.961]  It's really like probiotics,
[03:45:29.181 --> 03:45:30.361]  for your septic tank.
[03:45:30.361 --> 03:45:34.723]  Say goodbye to septic problems, gas buildup, and odor guaranteed.
[03:45:34.723 --> 03:45:39.025]  BioSeptic Pro is light years ahead of traditional septic treatments.
[03:45:39.025 --> 03:45:49.129]  They have a revolutionary patented delivery system that carries live microorganisms to treat the problem at its core, making their products up to 100 times more effective than its competitors.

[03:45:53.030 --> 03:45:56.712]  Secure your BioSeptic Pro today at TheBioPros.com.
[03:45:57.332 --> 03:46:04.115]  Not all vitamin and mineral supplements are equal.
[03:46:04.115 --> 03:46:05.196]  Many of them are synthetic.
[03:46:05.196 --> 03:46:07.177]  Many of them have fillers and additives.
[03:46:07.177 --> 03:46:09.838]  Many of them just pass right through the body and are not absorbed.
[03:46:09.838 --> 03:46:19.062]  Well, that's not the case with our incredibly popular because it's so effective product that has now been sold out for months, but it's finally back in stock.
[03:46:19.062 --> 03:46:21.544]  And that is Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[03:46:21.544 --> 03:46:24.185]  All the essential vitamins, all the essential minerals,
[03:46:24.565 --> 03:46:28.669]  A bunch of key amino acids to help it upload better into your body and your cells.
[03:46:28.669 --> 03:46:29.610]  It's in powder form.
[03:46:29.610 --> 03:46:30.771]  It's great for children.
[03:46:30.771 --> 03:46:31.752]  It's great for adults.
[03:46:31.752 --> 03:46:36.536]  It's really important for folks that are older because they don't absorb as well through their guts.
[03:46:36.536 --> 03:46:38.778]  This liquid formula really, really does.
[03:46:38.778 --> 03:46:46.485]  You mix up a pitcher of it every couple days, put it in the refrigerator, or keep it out in the kitchen, and just remember to drink it in the morning and in the evening.
[03:46:46.485 --> 03:46:47.506]  It tastes great.
[03:46:47.506 --> 03:46:48.847]  It makes your body healthy.
[03:46:48.847 --> 03:46:50.749]  It boosts your immune system, and it
[03:46:51.229 --> 03:46:53.513]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:47:22.776 --> 03:47:28.419]  Folks, I want to explain to everybody what the Havana Syndrome is.
[03:47:28.419 --> 03:47:32.321]  Because Kamala Harris has delayed her trip to Vietnam over it.
[03:47:33.254 --> 03:47:35.856]  You want me to pop in the first segment of your show to talk about this?
[03:47:35.856 --> 03:47:37.977]  Because we're out of time, but I can do it on my show tomorrow.
[03:47:37.977 --> 03:47:38.658]  Sure, come on in.
[03:47:38.658 --> 03:47:45.222]  All right, your show's coming up in about 10 minutes at InfoWars.com, Ford slash show, and radio stations, TV stations everywhere.
[03:47:45.222 --> 03:47:49.145]  Okay, now, Owen, I said, what do you want to hit in the final segment?
[03:47:49.145 --> 03:47:52.447]  I said, obviously, you're trying to raise a quarter million dollars for criminal defense.
[03:47:52.447 --> 03:47:54.048]  That's what it'll cost easily.
[03:47:54.048 --> 03:47:55.689]  If we fight it, we are fighting it.
[03:47:55.689 --> 03:48:00.092]  He did not break into the Capitol using physical force as he's been charged.
[03:48:00.092 --> 03:48:01.633]  He's facing at least a year in prison.
[03:48:01.633 --> 03:48:02.594]  We're not going to let that happen.
[03:48:03.414 --> 03:48:05.736]  Folks have sent $200,000 to your legal defense fund.
[03:48:05.736 --> 03:48:07.217]  That's great news.
[03:48:07.217 --> 03:48:08.017]  We want to get another $50,000.
[03:48:08.017 --> 03:48:10.219]  That should handle it.
[03:48:10.219 --> 03:48:11.860]  If folks want to go above that, that's fine.
[03:48:11.860 --> 03:48:16.824]  I think you should sue the Huffington Post saying that you led the attack and called for an attack on the Capitol.
[03:48:16.824 --> 03:48:17.664]  That's open and shut.
[03:48:17.664 --> 03:48:20.086]  And now you've been charged based on that lie.
[03:48:20.086 --> 03:48:21.467]  But you said no, you don't want to sue them.
[03:48:21.467 --> 03:48:23.869]  You're upset about the mask.
[03:48:24.485 --> 03:48:29.989]  Well, and we may look into other lawsuits going forward when some of the smoke starts to clear.
[03:48:29.989 --> 03:48:37.576]  But yeah, we have an executive order here from Governor Abbott that says you cannot mandate masks in any public buildings.
[03:48:37.576 --> 03:48:42.179]  And when I was in the federal building yesterday, I couldn't go in without putting a mask on.
[03:48:42.179 --> 03:48:46.543]  I had to wear the mask all through processing.
[03:48:46.543 --> 03:48:48.925]  My mask even broke at one of those, you know,
[03:48:49.545 --> 03:48:54.973]  Medical mask, it broke and so then they brought me like an even more official muzzle, like a painter's mask.
[03:48:54.973 --> 03:48:59.159]  So then I had to wear that, breathing in my own carbon, breathing in my own stinky breath.
[03:48:59.159 --> 03:49:00.321]  Totally illegal!
[03:49:00.321 --> 03:49:01.002]  Totally illegal!
[03:49:01.002 --> 03:49:06.169]  And I know that our Attorney General here, Ken Paxson, who I think is the best Attorney General in America by the way,
[03:49:06.770 --> 03:49:08.231]  I think he might be the best in America.
[03:49:08.231 --> 03:49:10.493]  Maybe Eric Schmidt right behind that in Missouri.
[03:49:10.493 --> 03:49:11.414]  Schmidt's awesome.
[03:49:11.414 --> 03:49:14.056]  Who just signed executive orders against those mandates as well.
[03:49:14.056 --> 03:49:25.045]  But how is it that I have executive orders that you can't mandate a mask in public government property in Texas, and then I'm going here throughout this entire process being forced to wear a mask.
[03:49:25.045 --> 03:49:26.607]  I mean, I'm locked in my cell.
[03:49:26.607 --> 03:49:28.408]  I obviously took it off.
[03:49:28.408 --> 03:49:31.050]  But throughout the whole process, in the courtroom, everything.
[03:49:31.050 --> 03:49:32.632]  It's a medical device.
[03:49:33.564 --> 03:49:35.305]  And they just say, oh, it's mandated.
[03:49:35.305 --> 03:49:36.645]  They got their signs everywhere.
[03:49:36.645 --> 03:49:42.187]  You were saying that the judge and the bailiffs weren't wearing it, but the FBI and everybody else were.
[03:49:42.187 --> 03:49:45.268]  Again, they're all just opting into the slavery.
[03:49:45.268 --> 03:49:46.808]  Yeah, it's kind of interesting.
[03:49:46.808 --> 03:49:47.348]  I'm not sure.
[03:49:47.348 --> 03:49:49.329]  I never... That's just like, let's show it.
[03:49:49.329 --> 03:49:52.430]  Pelosi, all the servants wear masks, but none of the libs do.
[03:49:52.430 --> 03:50:00.253]  And then this really bizarre footage, we have the raw footage in a minute, we'll play it, of Schumer doing weird snake dances with Stephen Colbert.
[03:50:00.253 --> 03:50:01.173]  But go ahead, sorry.
[03:50:02.168 --> 03:50:04.469]  You know, this is really a perfect example, though.
[03:50:04.469 --> 03:50:09.451]  All of Pelosi's elites, all the Democrat elites, they don't have to wear a mask.
[03:50:09.451 --> 03:50:10.552]  They go to lunch.
[03:50:10.552 --> 03:50:11.352]  They go to dinner.
[03:50:11.352 --> 03:50:12.272]  They have parties.
[03:50:12.272 --> 03:50:13.413]  No masks.
[03:50:13.413 --> 03:50:15.194]  But, oh, the servers have to wear masks.
[03:50:15.194 --> 03:50:19.536]  The unwashed swine of society that's not the liberal progressive Democrat.
[03:50:19.536 --> 03:50:20.696]  They dominate you.
[03:50:20.696 --> 03:50:22.277]  This is the new caste system.
[03:50:22.277 --> 03:50:26.919]  We're building a new caste, American caste system, just like they built in Israel.
[03:50:26.919 --> 03:50:31.261]  And these liberal progressives and Democrats want to sit on top of it, telling you what to do.
[03:50:31.781 --> 03:50:32.862]  Uh, telling you what to do with your body.
[03:50:32.862 --> 03:50:35.663]  And they're going to exercise the fraud that they don't wear the mask.
[03:50:35.663 --> 03:50:36.084]  But you do.
[03:50:36.084 --> 03:50:40.967]  Like Tucker Carlson showed San Francisco where they were shooting people in the street wouldn't wear a mask during the Spanish flu.
[03:50:40.967 --> 03:50:44.529]  They now admit 80% of the deaths were from the dirty bacterial pneumonia in the mask.
[03:50:44.529 --> 03:50:50.292]  And they finally had a boxing match that was a photo taken showing the mayor and the police chief and people not wearing masks.
[03:50:50.292 --> 03:50:52.814]  And that was enough nationwide to end the fake mask in 1918.
[03:50:52.814 --> 03:50:52.994]  Was that.
[03:50:55.217 --> 03:51:02.344]  Every day, I see violent crime happening on the streets of Chicago, violent crime happening on the streets of New York City, all these cities.
[03:51:02.344 --> 03:51:03.665]  Thousands dead a week!
[03:51:03.665 --> 03:51:08.670]  And I mean, it's like, I don't even really cover it because it's just every day, but it's like, hey, that's a real thing!
[03:51:08.670 --> 03:51:10.692]  It becomes this background noise.
[03:51:10.692 --> 03:51:11.773]  Can you guys roll Pelosi again?
[03:51:12.313 --> 03:51:15.415]  Somebody walking around the streets of San Francisco or New York, you never know.
[03:51:15.415 --> 03:51:16.856]  You can get your head bashed in.
[03:51:16.856 --> 03:51:19.298]  Some guy got stabbed like a dozen times in the face.
[03:51:19.298 --> 03:51:21.339]  I mean, shootings... Let's just say it.
[03:51:21.339 --> 03:51:24.861]  Crime is up five-fold from just three years ago in blue cities.
[03:51:24.861 --> 03:51:27.343]  So if you're... I mean, Austin used to be a safe city.
[03:51:27.343 --> 03:51:28.544]  And I'm a tough guy.
[03:51:28.544 --> 03:51:33.347]  I will not go downtown now unless I have to at a meeting and I bring a bodyguard.
[03:51:33.347 --> 03:51:37.070]  I mean, it is literally like a lunatic asylum down there.
[03:51:37.070 --> 03:51:37.950]  Look at this, Alex.
[03:51:37.950 --> 03:51:41.633]  Seven killed, 39 others wounded in weekend gun violence in Chicago.
[03:51:43.154 --> 03:51:49.944]  But, oh, they don't want to cover that because that just shows how Democrat-run cities are just completely falling into criminal hellholes.
[03:51:49.944 --> 03:51:51.726]  Which is the post-industrial plan.
[03:51:52.796 --> 03:52:01.341]  So it's all this panic over a virus or over a mask or over a vaccine, but then, oh, you know, you just walk out on the streets of a major city, you gotta watch out!
[03:52:01.341 --> 03:52:02.562]  You gotta have your head on a swivel!
[03:52:02.562 --> 03:52:04.863]  Alright, so Owen, let's talk about this for the time.
[03:52:04.863 --> 03:52:06.944]  People want to know about your case.
[03:52:06.944 --> 03:52:08.325]  What is it, DefendOwen.com?
[03:52:08.325 --> 03:52:10.146]  DefendOwen.com is the website.
[03:52:10.146 --> 03:52:13.828]  The support that has gone there, we've had over 3,000 donors.
[03:52:13.828 --> 03:52:15.909]  Last I checked, I think it was 3,200.
[03:52:15.909 --> 03:52:16.990]  It's just been incredible.
[03:52:16.990 --> 03:52:18.091]  It fills my heart.
[03:52:18.091 --> 03:52:19.591]  And this place isn't censoring us.
[03:52:19.591 --> 03:52:21.893]  Everybody doing crowdsourcing should use this place.
[03:52:22.293 --> 03:52:29.038]  Yeah, I was allowed to be on GoFundMe for like three hours, and then they canceled it, so we switched to GiveSendGo.
[03:52:29.038 --> 03:52:30.198]  It's been such a blessing.
[03:52:30.198 --> 03:52:33.541]  Defendo and .com, we're almost to our goal.
[03:52:33.541 --> 03:52:35.422]  And, you know, this could be a long battle.
[03:52:35.422 --> 03:52:36.623]  I hope it's short.
[03:52:36.623 --> 03:52:42.627]  I hope we can take care of this quickly, and justice, you know, and my innocence will be proven here.
[03:52:43.167 --> 03:53:00.055]  But this could be a long thing so so your support there having that financial support having that Confidence having that kind of lifted that that burden lifted off my shoulder has really been huge sure let's be clear I mean, I would have worked to get you the money for but I want to explain something to viewers We were in the red
[03:53:01.038 --> 03:53:04.140]  This year, until just a few months ago, then MyPillow came along.
[03:53:04.140 --> 03:53:07.902]  MyPillow.com, promo code Alex, you get up to 66% off.
[03:53:07.902 --> 03:53:10.263]  And that helped us get into the black sum.
[03:53:10.263 --> 03:53:13.905]  I gave the crew the first bonus in like seven, eight months, because they deserve a little bonus.
[03:53:13.905 --> 03:53:17.067]  That took half the extra money we had in the account.
[03:53:17.067 --> 03:53:27.133]  So when you start talking about all the Democratic lawsuits against us that we've defeated over 30 of them, almost 40 of them, we got a few left that you see in the news, and all the things we've paid out to stay on air and everything,
[03:53:28.093 --> 03:53:32.077]  It's a big deal to get lawyers to fly around in depositions and witnesses.
[03:53:32.077 --> 03:53:38.043]  I mean, to fight the feds in a case, they're going to spend themselves a million dollars trying to put Owen in jail.
[03:53:38.043 --> 03:53:45.670]  I mean, it's come out in news articles that some of the Democratic Party law firms that have been suing me have spent up to five million dollars per suit.
[03:53:46.670 --> 03:53:46.990]  I don't
[03:54:04.435 --> 03:54:08.436]  He said, pay them $15,000 or I'll basically rule against you.
[03:54:08.436 --> 03:54:10.216]  If this goes to trial, it'll cost millions.
[03:54:10.216 --> 03:54:12.097]  So I said, okay, I'll pay and settle.
[03:54:12.097 --> 03:54:15.817]  But I'd already spent a hundred and something thousand to beat their million plus.
[03:54:15.817 --> 03:54:25.619]  So I mean, folks, the entire Georgetown University has over a thousand lawyers suing us in Charlottesville saying we said stuff we didn't say.
[03:54:25.619 --> 03:54:27.180]  And that's coming up, that trial's coming up soon.
[03:54:27.180 --> 03:54:27.880]  That's the first one.
[03:54:28.300 --> 03:54:30.462]  So we are, and we're not victims here.
[03:54:30.462 --> 03:54:31.222]  I asked for this.
[03:54:31.222 --> 03:54:31.843]  I stepped up.
[03:54:31.843 --> 03:54:33.024]  I'm ready to die if need be.
[03:54:33.024 --> 03:54:34.004]  I mean, whatever.
[03:54:34.004 --> 03:54:36.106]  I just want to be effective to the end.
[03:54:36.106 --> 03:54:38.147]  It takes money to do this.
[03:54:38.147 --> 03:54:41.930]  We're spending millions a quarter on just bandwidth.
[03:54:41.930 --> 03:54:42.471]  I'm spending
[03:54:43.604 --> 03:55:01.939]  Hundreds of thousands of dollars just paying for shortwave globally and other satellites to service Africa and Asia and places where no money comes in, but we get the letters and hear the comments of African villages and people in Greece and, you know, people in Russia can see us on their satellites because we want minds.
[03:55:01.939 --> 03:55:03.621]  We want souls to wake up.
[03:55:03.621 --> 03:55:06.403]  And so you got to understand, I got a lot of stuff going on.
[03:55:06.403 --> 03:55:08.625]  And in the old days, when I could make money,
[03:55:09.045 --> 03:55:12.649]  I was funding so many groups and people behind the scenes.
[03:55:12.649 --> 03:55:16.553]  Now we don't fund a lot of folks behind the scenes because we're imploded down to who we are.
[03:55:16.553 --> 03:55:24.040]  But now our message is stronger, we've got more credibility than ever, people know we're dead on, and that's why keeping us on air is so essential.
[03:55:24.040 --> 03:55:29.266]  So go to infowarestore.com and get the vitamins, the minerals, the supplements.
[03:55:30.447 --> 03:55:33.851]  We've got mineral fusion back in stock.
[03:55:33.851 --> 03:55:34.152]  33% off.

[03:55:39.218 --> 03:55:43.363]  And if I had a bigger war chest, we would be much more confident.
[03:55:43.363 --> 03:55:44.103]  I'm not complaining.
[03:55:44.103 --> 03:55:49.129]  I'm just saying I spend 30-40% of my time trying to make money to fund our operation.
[03:55:50.598 --> 03:56:00.587]  I'm trying to jack with my house to fix a few things in it so I can sell it, so I can get money to run this place, because I bought a bigger, nicer house because I knew banks weren't safe and I wanted to increase money to have funding in the future.
[03:56:00.587 --> 03:56:01.828]  It was done on purpose.
[03:56:01.828 --> 03:56:05.992]  But I'm literally selling my house to fund this because you can see there's no future anyways.
[03:56:05.992 --> 03:56:10.877]  I'm just totally in, total commitment, everything, just want to win, don't want to bet my whole life on this and fail.
[03:56:11.457 --> 03:56:12.878]  Everything, everything, everything.
[03:56:12.878 --> 03:56:16.019]  So, go to infowarestore.com, get Ultimate Krill all back in stock.
[03:56:16.019 --> 03:56:16.539]  It's incredible.

[03:56:22.062 --> 03:56:22.922]  Take action.
[03:56:22.922 --> 03:56:25.883]  Screwing around and not taking action is how the enemy's going to win.
[03:56:25.883 --> 03:56:31.646]  And you can't buy better products and fund a liberty movement at the same time anywhere but here.
[03:56:31.646 --> 03:56:32.646]  This is the place to do it.
[03:56:32.646 --> 03:56:34.207]  And listen, Tucker Carlson
[03:56:35.467 --> 03:56:39.689]  He's a great guy, and he's awake, and he's kicking ass.
[03:56:39.689 --> 03:56:40.629]  He's a blessing from God.
[03:56:40.629 --> 03:56:42.390]  And we're not in competition with him.
[03:56:42.390 --> 03:56:44.111]  And he does what he does better than we do.
[03:56:44.111 --> 03:56:47.612]  But with our reports, and our special reports, and what we do, it's something different.
[03:56:47.612 --> 03:56:50.033]  And it inspires not just him, but countless others.
[03:56:50.033 --> 03:56:53.654]  So you need to understand, folks, we are literally the armory of resistance.
[03:56:53.654 --> 03:56:57.996]  We are the intellectual cutting edge for foreign leaders and so many others.
[03:56:57.996 --> 03:57:01.698]  What we do here, our guests, you, this whole spirit, is changing the world.
[03:57:02.518 --> 03:57:10.759]  Commit today to go to MFORWARSTORE.COM while you still can and get books and t-shirts and films to build our war chest during this critical time because the enemy's making their full move.
[03:57:10.759 --> 03:57:11.320]  Owen Schroer.
[03:57:11.789 --> 03:57:14.711]  This is the modern-day David versus Goliath.
[03:57:14.711 --> 03:57:16.812]  We don't have the purse of the government.
[03:57:16.812 --> 03:57:19.414]  We don't have the purse of the Democrat Party.
[03:57:19.414 --> 03:57:26.319]  We don't have billion-dollar corporations that fund our infrastructure and our crew and run ads on our network.
[03:57:26.319 --> 03:57:27.079]  No, we don't have any of that.
[03:57:27.079 --> 03:57:27.600]  We have you.
[03:57:27.600 --> 03:57:30.361]  We have you in the audience and we have us.
[03:57:30.361 --> 03:57:32.883]  It's us versus the entire salary.
[03:57:32.883 --> 03:57:34.864]  It's David versus Goliath.
[03:57:34.864 --> 03:57:35.205]  That's right.
[03:57:35.205 --> 03:57:36.585]  Your show's coming up now.
[03:57:36.585 --> 03:57:37.206]  You're coming on.
[03:57:37.366 --> 03:57:39.108]  And I'm gonna come on about the Havana Syndrome.
[03:57:39.108 --> 03:57:40.409]  I'm gonna solve the mystery.
[03:57:40.409 --> 03:57:41.651]  I'm gonna solve the mystery.
[03:57:41.651 --> 03:57:42.672]  Tomorrow's news today.
[03:57:42.672 --> 03:57:46.176]  The Havana Syndrome will be solved right now in the War Room.
