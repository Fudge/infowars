[00:00.000 --> 00:16.000]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War, and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe you've got one!
[00:16.000 --> 00:40.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:40.000 --> 00:56.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Friday. We're broadcasting worldwide. I am driving back to the office right now. The only time I could get in to see a dentist was today at this time, and it took a little bit longer, so I am driving in to the office right now.
[00:56.000 --> 01:08.000]  And I should be in there by about 15 after or so. We again are going to have Eddie Bravo, Sam Tripoli in studio, and going to have a big debate about science and about the nature of reality coming up.
[01:08.000 --> 01:15.000]  We also have some other special guests on today, and I'm going to have some special guests visit towards the end of the show that I'm not going to announce until that happens.
[01:15.000 --> 01:25.000]  And some big surprises. We're obviously going to get into the new fake scandal with Ukraine, which Trump has a total right to contact foreign leaders and find out about traders in our government.
[01:25.000 --> 01:42.000]  The swiss blower is all fake, didn't even have firsthand knowledge of it. The big story is Trump's being spied on. That's why we've got to continue to support President Trump under the unprecedented attack he's under, but that doesn't mean we're in a cult and support him on things that we don't agree with or are unconstitutional.
[01:42.000 --> 01:57.000]  That said, Info Wars is literally the pro-America anti-globalist beacon of truth, and our reporters and our crew and the guests we have on and the callers we have so many times end up breaking the news for anybody else does.
[01:57.000 --> 02:03.000]  And it scares the hell out of me because people ask what scares me. What scares me is not winning and let these globalists win.
[02:03.000 --> 02:14.000]  And that so many times it's Info Wars or my reporters or our crew that get the interview or get the video that changes the whole paradigm and absolutely exposes what's going on.
[02:14.000 --> 02:22.000]  My main mission is to become obsolete and then still just promote Americana and be regular news reporters.
[02:22.000 --> 02:30.000]  But we are hardcore folks that take the bull by the horns that hit the barbed wire and deliver over and over and over and over again.
[02:30.000 --> 02:42.000]  And so I just again want to tell the listeners that without your support, we're spreading the word, without your prayer, we're going to be taking off the gear the next, I don't know, I can push this another 15, 16 months.
[02:42.000 --> 02:50.000]  But there's no way to go half speed. There's no way to just have layoffs the way the infrastructure works because we're already leading in meme.
[02:50.000 --> 03:01.000]  We go 110% of the election and we hope that we'll get the funds in to go after that. But I'm expending all backup resources and selling inventory that we won't have in the future.
[03:01.000 --> 03:08.000]  We're holding stuff back for people that have things on auto ship at least two orders out in the future. So that's secure.
[03:08.000 --> 03:15.000]  But man, I'm going to tell you, this is crunch time. This is it. We've been under massive censorship, massive attack on so many levels.
[03:15.000 --> 03:27.000]  I don't have to go over it all for you. But it's it's it's historical. It's biblical. It's massive. So in four store dot com in fours life dot com are the main sites or triple eight to five three three one three nine.
[03:27.000 --> 03:33.000]  I want to thank everybody that supported us over the years. We've already done amazing things and I want God to keep me in this fight and to do that.
[03:33.000 --> 03:41.000]  I've got to work harder, be more focused, do even more. I think everybody's noticed I've been more focused. I've been more on target.
[03:41.000 --> 03:48.000]  We've been really kicking ass over the other broadcast because we know this is for all the marbles. So I am committed to you.
[03:48.000 --> 03:56.000]  I am committed to never back down. I'm committed to never waiver or sell out to the NWO. I'll never give in. I'll never give up.
[03:56.000 --> 04:08.000]  But I can give out. I can run out of gas politically, economically, spiritually, and you know, my will has massive resources because I know how serious the cost is.
[04:08.000 --> 04:16.000]  I don't have any problem in that department, but it's financial. So just get in there and get fish oil you need. Get ultra 12 out of me 12 you need.
[04:16.000 --> 04:26.000]  You know, just get the high quality American coffee that we never discount because it's already way lower than competitors that sold to major stores to high end coffee shop.
[04:26.000 --> 04:39.000]  It's Mexico and just, you know, get in there and get the toothpaste sign up for auto ships. You don't forget so that every week or every month or every three months or whatever you want.
[04:39.000 --> 04:46.000]  It gets re delivered to you info or store.com or AAA 2533139. And again, I'm driving in right now to the office and we've got a big broadcast lined up for you today.
[04:46.000 --> 04:56.000]  And I'm very thankful for you doing in and the biggest power you've got is prayer and spreading the word about band.video where you find all the live shows and archives and for work.com for a show.
[04:56.000 --> 05:17.000]  Don't let them stop the transmission.
[05:26.000 --> 05:50.000]  And I recommend you order another bottle to give friends and family because this stuff has really worked for myself and so many others.
[05:50.000 --> 05:59.000]  It's exclusively available at infowarslife.com. Again, secure your hapies today at infowarslife.com.
[05:59.000 --> 06:23.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover up. You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he live from the info wars.com studios. It's Alex Jones.
[06:23.000 --> 06:39.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here. I'm on my way into the office. I had to go to a dental appointment. This is the only time they can do it.
[06:39.000 --> 06:53.000]  So again, I am on my way almost in. I will be live in studio by the third segment at about 20 after and we've got a huge broadcast lined up for you on this live Friday global edition.
[06:53.000 --> 07:05.000]  Now the last few days, I've had a lot of listeners email us and call the office and I've seen the comments on infowars.com and newswars.com saying why isn't Alex covering Ukraine?
[07:05.000 --> 07:18.000]  Why isn't he covering the whistleblowers scandal? Well, I cover mainstream news when I think it's really important, but when it's old news and it's old hat and it's nothing but a Democrat distraction, I have a blind spot for just not covering
[07:18.000 --> 07:25.000]  because there's so many huge things happening like the private Federal Reserve trying to buck the president and trying to kill the economy.
[07:25.000 --> 07:37.000]  All of the mainstream corporate media along with Communist China trying to badmouth the U.S. economy to drive it under and so much of the left joining in on it and admitting that they want to plunge the economy to, quote, teach Trump and
[07:37.000 --> 07:52.000]  middle America and conservatives and Christians a lesson. I mean, that's just over the top, crazy. And then you've got all the open borders and you've got the left pushing race war and all the anti-foot garbage and Beto and the Democrats officially saying they want to ban all the firearms.
[07:52.000 --> 08:02.000]  I'll play a clip of that in a moment. We got serious, serious, serious stuff going on. Babies being kept alive or organs being sold, all the Epstein pedophile ring stuff coming out.
[08:02.000 --> 08:09.000]  The fact that all the assistance from Google, Facebook, all of them are watching and listening to people and reporting back. I mean, it's just a crazy time.
[08:09.000 --> 08:16.000]  But you know what? The listeners are right. I should have been covering this because we've researched it. We've already covered it years ago and we know what a hoax it is.
[08:16.000 --> 08:31.000]  But only to put it to bed. You see, the last three plus years of Russia hoax sucked all the oxygen out of the room so that we couldn't cover the Democrats in bed with the Islamics and the Democrats in bed with the Russians and the Chai comms and the Democrats openly selling the nation out.
[08:31.000 --> 08:39.000]  So instead of defending ourselves on Russiagate, I had to do it. We should have just been on offense the whole time, which I did most of the time, but still it's a distraction.
[08:39.000 --> 08:47.000]  So how do you handle a distraction when they're trying to destroy you personally, but you know it's a distraction? Well, you do it by just laying the facts down. So let me just up front lay the facts out there.
[08:47.000 --> 09:04.000]  I know most of you already know this. It's totally legal and lawful. The president, who heads up the executive branch, has talked to any foreign leader he wants about any subject and to find out about what his political opposition has done that's illegal or unlawful or treasonous or traitorous or dirty or nasty against the country.
[09:04.000 --> 09:13.000]  Hillary used hundreds of millions of dollars of U.S. money to dig up dirt and disinformation on President Trump during the campaign and after. That's all on record.
[09:13.000 --> 09:20.000]  And Obama and Hillary funded five billion dollars of U.S. taxpayer money to overthrow the elected government of Ukraine a year and a half before the election.
[09:20.000 --> 09:27.000]  So again, we covered all of that in great detail. And so the fact that the president looked into that, we covered it all at the time.
[09:27.000 --> 09:35.000]  We had guests on about it at the time from Russia, from Ukraine. We had Papinopoulos on. We had everybody on.
[09:35.000 --> 09:44.000]  And we pushed the president to go after Hillary and Biden and his son and the gas company and the billions stolen and all the rest of it.
[09:44.000 --> 09:51.000]  And so what the Democrats are doing is changing the subject from all the massive crimes they've committed, just like Rudolph Giuliani put out a tweet.
[09:51.000 --> 10:00.000]  It's totally true. And they are just simply putting this out there so the president gets on the defense because they know that the indictments have already been handed down against McCabe and others.
[10:00.000 --> 10:09.000]  And that the Justice Department refused to kill it, which I don't think they should have the power to kill it, but they had that power, the number two, the Justice Department.
[10:09.000 --> 10:18.000]  And that indeed happened. So this is an epic time to be alive. We're going to be breaking it all down here on the transmission today.
[10:18.000 --> 10:27.000]  But this is just the new scandal to divert and distract from what the Democrats are doing and the fact that the president tried to block a whistleblower.
[10:27.000 --> 10:34.000]  Well, it's the executive branch and the whistleblower never had direct knowledge of what they're just saying. It's just made up.
[10:34.000 --> 10:40.000]  That's not a whistleblower under the definition. Plus, a whistleblower only has protection if what they're covering is illegal.
[10:40.000 --> 10:42.000]  But everybody's missing the big story here.
[10:42.000 --> 10:51.000]  When you read the fine print, the Washington Post, The New York Times articles, they admit that U.S. intelligence community was listening to the president's call.
[10:51.000 --> 10:58.000]  Now, when Israel got caught, they think, with some listening devices, some dragonfly systems, in D.C., it was a big hubbub.
[10:58.000 --> 11:01.000]  Political wrote about it. Great. Absolutely. I don't want anybody spying on us.
[11:01.000 --> 11:05.000]  Whether it's England, Israel, especially China, Russia, you name it.
[11:05.000 --> 11:09.000]  But when the intelligence agencies do it to the president, that's a big deal. It's illegal.
[11:09.000 --> 11:14.000]  Remember when they were doing it to members of the intelligence committee of the CIA a decade ago and it was a huge scandal?
[11:14.000 --> 11:22.000]  It's incredible. And so you have a lot of deep state people put in there by Obama and Hillary and the Bushes, who are neocons, who want to stop Trump.
[11:22.000 --> 11:30.000]  And they're doing this. So the real illegality is what they've done. And the fact that they're claiming that Trump's trying to obstruct justice by trying to block a whistleblower.
[11:30.000 --> 11:36.000]  Obama arrested hundreds of real whistleblowers and put them in jail.
[11:36.000 --> 11:42.000]  Look at that. He persecuted hundreds of members of the press, but they've been jailed, which is very dangerous and they shouldn't have done.
[11:42.000 --> 11:55.000]  This isn't one-one-millionth of what Obama did because it's not even bad. In fact, it isn't even one-one-millionth or billionth because it's the default position of a president surrounded by traitors, surrounded by cowards.
[11:55.000 --> 12:01.000]  You know, I'll tell you, I've been threatened, I've been attacked, I've been sued more than 30 times, already got 20-plus up and thrown out.
[12:01.000 --> 12:09.000]  I'm not going to go into the news because I simply supported Americana and the Second Amendment and unborn babies and born babies' rights and didn't want to euthanize old people.
[12:09.000 --> 12:13.000]  I didn't want to take the guns. And so, oh, you're a Trump supporter. We're going to destroy you.
[12:13.000 --> 12:18.000]  And I've been offered the olive branch, too. Just come out against Trump, come out against the Second Amendment, it will all go away.
[12:18.000 --> 12:22.000]  Well, I can't give up my integrity and who I am, but I'll say this before we go to the specter of the work club.
[12:22.000 --> 12:34.000]  Listeners, we've built an infrastructure at InfoWars with the satellite uplinks, the radio uplinks, the train crew, the database of news reports, the research that is a national treasure in truth.
[12:34.000 --> 12:40.000]  That's the reality. Our guests, our crew, our callers, the community that we've built is something really, really special.
[12:40.000 --> 12:49.000]  And I got to tell you, we're on a trajectory where if I sell all the t-shirts and all the books and all the films and all the water filters and all the supplements, I've got.
[12:49.000 --> 12:54.000]  I can fund things even with some cutbacks for about a year and four months.
[12:54.000 --> 12:58.000]  And then we shutter the doors. It implodes. It goes away.
[12:58.000 --> 13:10.000]  People say, oh, we'll just cut back. There's no way to manage something as big as InfoWars, the bandwidth cost, the IT cost, the net security cost, the legal, the crew, all of it.
[13:10.000 --> 13:16.000]  It's absolutely something that can't be done unless we at least stabilize the level we're at.
[13:16.000 --> 13:19.000]  You've seen me add more shows, add more broadcasts. I've done everything I can.
[13:19.000 --> 13:21.000]  We're in the heart of the fight here for the Republic.
[13:21.000 --> 13:26.000]  And we are putting out the talking points, the countervail, the globalist, and their criminal activities.
[13:26.000 --> 13:29.000]  And that's why InfoWars is so precious. But I got to tell you, I've never really done marketing.
[13:29.000 --> 13:35.000]  I just get high-quality products that I know are great, and they only mark them up 150% when all the other supplement companies do it.
[13:35.000 --> 13:37.000]  That's our main funder. Again, five to seven times.
[13:37.000 --> 13:41.000]  And I was warned by a few marketing people that got brought in over the years.
[13:41.000 --> 13:50.000]  And they said, listen, everybody else just 300, 400, 500% markup, even on water filters, 200% air filters, and 300% because of overhead, because of cost,
[13:50.000 --> 13:54.000]  because of people tend to buy what's more expensive, thinking it's better.
[13:54.000 --> 13:58.000]  You get some of the best brands, and then undercut the whole market. You're undercutting yourself.
[13:58.000 --> 14:02.000]  You're going to get in a position where people only buy stuff.
[14:02.000 --> 14:10.000]  Of course, you sell a lot of air filters when the competition's 500, 600, 700 bucks, and you're selling it for $150 when the unit costs $100.
[14:10.000 --> 14:20.000]  Stop it. And I've habituated the audience to where, yeah, we sell a lot of air filters and water filters and a lot of supplements because the deals are so good.
[14:20.000 --> 14:24.000]  I mean, DNA force is sold out right now. Of course, we sell a lot of it at 70-something bucks.
[14:24.000 --> 14:33.000]  Living competitors are $300, because PQQ and CoQ10, when it's from organic real sources and all these other products, cost 50 bottles for a little bitty bottle of just PQQ or CoQ10,
[14:33.000 --> 14:37.000]  and that's synthetic crap, but there's still 15 bucks a product in that.
[14:37.000 --> 14:42.000]  So, I'm going to tell listeners, infowarstore.com. We got a bunch of specials about to end.
[14:42.000 --> 14:49.000]  50% off is supermodality with a free bottle of Ultimate Female Force. You've got to try that for stamina, libido energy. It's amazing.
[14:49.000 --> 14:52.000]  A lot of folks just take energy drinks and things that are stimulus to have energy.
[14:52.000 --> 14:59.000]  The base of it is your hormones and your glands and how this all works synergistically.
[14:59.000 --> 15:09.000]  Ultimate Female Force will blow your wife or girlfriend away. Free bottle of it, infowarstore.com. Ultra 12, infowarstore.com.
[15:09.000 --> 15:14.000]  The best B12 out there, take it out of the tongue. Total foundational. Read what it does for you. 50% off.
[15:14.000 --> 15:17.000]  And a bunch of other specials that have to end this weekend.
[15:17.000 --> 15:24.000]  We're going to keep fighting, keep fighting as hard as we can, but just get a T-shirt, get a book, sign up for auto-ship for the coffee, the fluoride-free toothpaste, super blue.
[15:24.000 --> 15:31.000]  These are great products you already need. And if the listeners that haven't ever bought product or have not brought it in the wall, if you'll just come do it, we can continue on in the election year.
[15:31.000 --> 15:36.000]  It's a key fight to keep Trump on target, to get out there and get you the viral videos you've seen.
[15:36.000 --> 15:41.000]  I mean, we're still putting out stuff that reaches tens of millions of people a week with these great films that Millie Weaver and others are making,
[15:41.000 --> 15:49.000]  but they need the support. InfoWars is a major infrastructure, so please continue to invest in your future and your health at infowarstore.com.
[15:49.000 --> 15:57.000]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic. It's Alex Jones.
[15:57.000 --> 16:04.000]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house. I sued the IRS in one.
[16:04.000 --> 16:13.000]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since. I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[16:13.000 --> 16:19.000]  I can help you too. If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day. There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[16:19.000 --> 16:45.000]  Call 834 no tax, or go to my website, danpilla.com. That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[16:50.000 --> 16:57.000]  That's 866-295-5305. HBXTrack.com. Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[16:57.000 --> 17:05.000]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me. You don't know me and will never meet. I had a problem like you once.
[17:05.000 --> 17:12.000]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life.
[17:12.000 --> 17:25.000]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me. If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone, you need to call the National Treatment Advisors.
[17:25.000 --> 17:32.000]  They'll immerse you into a 30-day program to replace your old habits with new habits and totally change your life.

[17:58.000 --> 18:00.000]  Josh in Washington. You're on the air. Go ahead.
[18:00.000 --> 18:10.000]  Alex, God bless you. I have an idea for a new InfoWars t-shirt. Instead of, this is your brain. This is your brain on drugs. This is your brain. This is your brain on 5G.
[18:10.000 --> 18:15.000]  Showing your brain, getting fried. Then I have some comments on your supplements, man. Totally changed my life.
[18:15.000 --> 18:30.000]  I use TurboForce, bodies, Albu power, BrainForce, Fish Oil, Ultra12, Daily X2 every several days. Now, what I've found is really combining them is totally synergistic and transcendent feeling that I get by combining all your products.
[18:30.000 --> 18:33.000]  And I just want to urge all your listeners who haven't tried them, I just want to say why not.
[18:33.000 --> 18:43.000]  Well, you're right that all of these things are known to be incredible, whether it's turmeric or whether it's the fish oil or the krill oil or whether it's the DNA force with the CoQ10 and BioPQQ and all the rest of it.
[18:43.000 --> 18:50.000]  All of these are things that are like rocket fuel on the body. You take these bases together, then you have your foundation, now you can build the big, strong temple.
[18:50.000 --> 18:59.000]  With these products I take, when I religiously remember to take them, it makes my life so much better. And then it funds the information war, which is so critical. Thank you so much. God bless you.
[18:59.000 --> 19:17.000]  We have entered a great time of change. The social engineers who serve Satan, who are in control of this planet, believe that if they can organize enough crises that they control, they can terrorize the planet into accepting a tyrannical corporate world government
[19:17.000 --> 19:24.000]  known as a technocracy in their own words that will manage and control and manipulate every facet of our lives.
[19:24.000 --> 19:36.000]  At first, they give you just a few basic things to do. Don't support Trump. Don't promote Alex Jones. And once you've submitted to that, well, don't say mother and father and, well, let us sterilize your children.
[19:36.000 --> 19:42.000]  Take these force inoculations and here, take this Prozac pill and here, smoke this weaponized marijuana.
[19:42.000 --> 19:55.000]  Don't be a Christian. This is truly the market of the beat system and we're on air right now covering it. And you're awake. You're involved. You're engaged. You're an ambassador of truth. So I'm begging you for yourself and myself and my family and your family.
[19:55.000 --> 20:16.000]  Spread the word about info wars.com. The live shows right now.
[20:25.000 --> 20:52.000]  It is Friday, September 20th, 2019. We're here broadcasting worldwide. We have a lot to fight for our children, our future, our species, great saga. My son is now 17 years old and he's six to 220 pounds.
[20:52.000 --> 21:03.000]  But that's not why I'm so excited about Rex. He is way smarter than I was at 17. He wants to follow in my footsteps and he might even graduate early.
[21:03.000 --> 21:13.000]  It looks like from high school and plans to come into the fight with us, ladies and gentlemen, during the critical wars that are taking place. That's what it's all about.
[21:13.000 --> 21:24.000]  Thank you for joining us, ladies and gentlemen on this Friday global transmission. It's a huge distraction going after Trump on Ukraine. It's a total fraud.
[21:24.000 --> 21:40.000]  Trump openly announced he was doing it last year. And this year, when they got a new leader in Ukraine, Hillary committed the crimes. The president's purview is to find out who is selling us out to foreign interest.
[21:40.000 --> 21:49.000]  The whistleblower is fake. We're going to cover it all today. We've got a bunch of guests in studio. It's a big Friday edition, but front and center.
[21:49.000 --> 22:01.000]  What really matters here is that they're coming for the second amendment and they mean business this time. That's why they're openly declaring they're coming to confiscate all semi-autos.
[22:01.000 --> 22:15.000]  But depending on what statistic you look at, between 84 and 92%, I've been looking up the numbers of firearms of modern manufacture in the United States are semi-auto.
[22:15.000 --> 22:22.000]  Most of your handguns are semi-auto. Most of your rifles are semi-auto. Everybody knows that most sales of guns are semi-auto.
[22:22.000 --> 22:32.000]  Most shotguns aren't over-unders. Even though I use an over-under when I get to go dub hunting, that's never. An elegant Italian over-under.
[22:32.000 --> 22:40.000]  Most people out there are shooting the auto loaders. Eight shots, you name it, they're supposed to only hunt birds with foremost states.
[22:40.000 --> 22:47.000]  They're coming for the guns and they know it won't stop crime and they know mass shootings are very rare.
[22:47.000 --> 22:53.000]  They don't care. They're spewing all these fake statistics because they know an economic collapse is coming. They're engineering one.
[22:53.000 --> 23:02.000]  Trump and some patriots in our government tried to stop it. I think we might have a soft landing still, but this nation is under foreign globalist attack.
[23:02.000 --> 23:14.000]  And the fact that Americans haven't even more embraced Trump or haven't even more embraced Info Wars or more embraced the resistance shows that we are a wounded nation.
[23:14.000 --> 23:25.000]  We are spiritually very wicked. We are in the depths of decadence and we have to move forward and defeat the globalists because we love our children and we love justice.
[23:25.000 --> 23:35.000]  And letting the globalists get full control will be 100 times worse, but we need to repent and admit that we're falling and that we keep babies alive after they're born now and kill them.
[23:35.000 --> 23:43.000]  And that old people begging to be kept alive or being murdered. Oh, it's not right to life. It's right to die. It's right for them to kill you.
[23:43.000 --> 23:48.000]  But we're seeing real evil take its mask off in an attempt to demoralize us and break our will.
[23:48.000 --> 23:55.000]  And I harp on that constantly because that's what they're trying to do right at our moment of beginning to turn the tide.
[23:55.000 --> 24:03.000]  Now that said, first and foremost is the move against the Second Amendment and the First Amendment. The two are inexorably entwined.
[24:03.000 --> 24:09.000]  The first defends all the others. The second in an emergency defends all the others.
[24:09.000 --> 24:16.000]  And the left comes in and takes control of cities, ships and the drugs, perhaps the police, crime rates explode.
[24:16.000 --> 24:24.000]  This is a system of management that the social engineers admit they use. It's in the WikiLeaks. It's in their own statements.
[24:24.000 --> 24:34.000]  It's why they do it. Every city they control. Homelessness, PCs, needles, heroin, fentanyl, devil worship, occultism.
[24:34.000 --> 24:48.000]  I've got stacks of articles I wasn't even looking for out of mainstream news about Mexico and rampant devil worship, murdering babies, drinking blood, having sex with corpses.
[24:48.000 --> 24:55.000]  And it's not isolated. It's exploding as the worship of death expands. And the same thing's happening here.
[24:55.000 --> 25:06.000]  We are cursed. How Mexican cartel girl assassins bathe in blood of their victims and have sex with their corpses.
[25:06.000 --> 25:14.000]  There is a great divide happening. The wheat from the chaff, the gold from the pewter.
[25:14.000 --> 25:21.000]  And it's happening all over the world. Evil is coming into the world. So is good.
[25:21.000 --> 25:25.000]  Beto Rourke has been photographed, of course, with major cartel trafficking heads.
[25:25.000 --> 25:29.000]  He's heavily involved in human trafficking, which is really their biggest business now.
[25:29.000 --> 25:38.000]  And he has a will to take your guns as a former burglar, as a hit and run specialist, as a man who wrote essays about running children over with automobiles.
[25:38.000 --> 25:46.000]  He laughs when he talks about death. He can't even hide his evil snarl because they want to collapse civilization.
[25:46.000 --> 25:52.000]  They want power over the good. That's their destination. They want failure. They want destruction.
[25:52.000 --> 25:58.000]  They come to kill, still in destroy. So Beto says, of course, we're going to take your guns, but only the ones that are designed to kill.
[25:58.000 --> 26:07.000]  Well, guns are designed to kill to protect yourself or to hunt game, to equalize the force of the individual against armed mobs or corrupt governments.
[26:07.000 --> 26:17.000]  But Beto knows that. But now, because it's been so obvious now that they're real planners to get our guns, because Trump and others have tricked them to be open about it.
[26:17.000 --> 26:28.000]  Now he tries to back it off in the same breath on CNN just last night saying, of course, I want to ban the guns, but people are crazy and fear mongering.
[26:28.000 --> 26:33.000]  I don't want to take your guns. He just wants to take roughly 90% of your guns.
[26:33.000 --> 26:39.000]  And of course, it will be the others after that because they've got something big planned during this period coming up.
[26:39.000 --> 26:54.000]  You take one look in their eyes and one look at history and one look at how they behave. They go out of their way to destroy their own nest because they want that power to rule and to crush and to kill and to rape.
[26:54.000 --> 27:05.000]  Satan comes forth like a lion roaring to see who he made of our, because when they roar, people get scared and go and fall down so the lion can eat you instead.
[27:05.000 --> 27:14.000]  The lion comes, you grab your spears and soon the lion is the hunter. Satan's not really a lion.
[27:14.000 --> 27:22.000]  He's a snake that slithers out in the grass and waits till you walk by and hits you.
[27:22.000 --> 27:28.000]  He says, oh, you're not feeling well. What you need is more of me. Take me to your breast and then I'll take care of you.
[27:28.000 --> 27:40.000]  That latches on to you like Cleopatra's bosom. Here's Beto using double thing. He just said two plus two equals four, but it doesn't equal four. Here it is.
[27:40.000 --> 27:47.000]  Are you in fact in favor of gun confiscation?
[27:47.000 --> 27:59.000]  Yes. When it comes to AR-15s and AK-47s, weapons designed for use on a military battlefield, the high impact, high velocity round that is fired from those weapons.
[27:59.000 --> 28:09.000]  When it hits your body, expends all of its kinetic energy, destroying everything that's inside, and I've met those who survived fire from an AK-47.
[28:09.000 --> 28:15.000]  I've met those who've lost a family member. That belongs on the battlefield, does not belong in this country.
[28:15.000 --> 28:24.000]  When it comes to those weapons, Chris, the answer is yes, but when it comes to firearms used for hunting or self-defense, the answer is no.
[28:24.000 --> 28:33.000]  And I don't want you or anyone else to get into the fear-mongering that some have fallen prey to, saying that the government's going to come and take all of your guns.
[28:33.000 --> 28:38.000]  What we are talking about exclusively is weapons of war that have no place in our home.
[28:38.000 --> 28:39.000]  I hear you.
[28:39.000 --> 28:40.000]  No place on our streets.
[28:40.000 --> 28:49.000]  This is total complete gaslighting. You know, there was just a guy got attacked by a gang in Georgia, took him out with a semi-automatic AK-47.
[28:49.000 --> 29:16.000]  Now, they want all the semi-autos, so the criminals, and they have them, because Petrelorork is a narcotics trafficking criminal.
[29:16.000 --> 29:22.000]  If you're ready to flee the city to the freedom of Idaho or Montana, our Black Rifle Real Estate team is here to help.
[29:22.000 --> 29:48.000]  Go to BlackRifleRealEstate.com. That's BlackRifleRealEstate.com.
[29:53.000 --> 30:10.000]  The last week and a half, we've been running two specials that are the best deals in our history.
[30:10.000 --> 30:14.000]  75% off the Total Gut Health Combo Pack.
[30:14.000 --> 30:19.000]  That's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight different products at over 50%.
[30:19.000 --> 30:20.000]  It's incredible.
[30:20.000 --> 30:27.000]  We also have the Dust Till Dawn Imphal Wars AMP Impact, which makes it easy to take it in the morning and take it in the evening.
[30:27.000 --> 30:30.000]  13 different key capsules that are incredible.
[30:30.000 --> 30:32.000]  You want to supercharge your life?
[30:32.000 --> 30:37.000]  This helps you remember to do it, and the results for myself and many others have been nothing less than astounding.
[30:37.000 --> 30:38.000]  Plus, you can't beat it.
[30:38.000 --> 30:39.000]  It funds the information war.
[30:39.000 --> 30:43.000]  You have absolutely nothing to lose, but not taking action.
[30:43.000 --> 30:49.000]  Believe you, the Deke State, Hillary, Obama, the NWO, they hope you don't support Imphal Wars.
[30:49.000 --> 30:51.000]  In this urgent moment, they're trying to shut us down.
[30:51.000 --> 30:53.000]  So we've got a whole bunch of other specials running as well.
[30:53.000 --> 30:54.000]  Check them out.
[30:54.000 --> 30:55.000]  They're all about to end.
[30:55.000 --> 30:57.000]  ImphalWarsStore.com.
[30:59.000 --> 31:03.000]  I know most of you realize this, but I'm going to say it again very, very clearly.
[31:03.000 --> 31:07.000]  You are just as important as I am or the rest of the crew at Imphal Wars.
[31:07.000 --> 31:13.000]  And we are the individuals that have done the research to understand the global spattle plan, and we know how to take them down.
[31:13.000 --> 31:15.000]  That's why they're so upset.
[31:15.000 --> 31:17.000]  Think how far we've come together.
[31:17.000 --> 31:27.000]  You know, even if we were losing, we'd all still keep fighting on because it's the right thing to do against the truly satanic forces of the New World Order who've really taken the mask off.
[31:27.000 --> 31:29.000]  The line's in the sand for everybody now.
[31:29.000 --> 31:34.000]  But you'd already chosen to fight the corruption and to stand with God and to stand with the unborn.
[31:34.000 --> 31:40.000]  So I just want to take time out again to salute the audience because you are truly activist in the arena.
[31:40.000 --> 31:48.000]  And without you and your prayers and your word of mouth and your financial support, this operation that you built, that your operation would not be here.
[31:48.000 --> 31:53.000]  We've got some giant specials running right now at ImphalWarsStore.com. A lot of items are pretty percent off.
[31:53.000 --> 32:11.000]  Please take advantage of it at ImphalWarsStore.com to help us fight even harder into the future.
[32:24.000 --> 32:31.000]  Band.video isn't just going to be a home for Alex Jones or David Knight or Owen Schreuer or Paul Watson band videos.
[32:31.000 --> 32:35.000]  We are building it to be a place where band memes are able to be posted.
[32:35.000 --> 32:49.000]  And where a growing list of freedom-loving contributors are able to have a home free from being shut down, free from being censored, free from being silenced by big tech, the chai comms, the Hollywood scum, and the globlest.
[32:49.000 --> 32:59.000]  Freedom of speech has a home. It's called band.video. America and the world is fighting back against tyranny at band.video.
[33:19.000 --> 33:34.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[33:34.000 --> 33:51.000]  Hello. In the Nakil switch in place, Obama put in that Trump won't get rid of. Can't you Trump? Oh, you think you stop Huawei? Ha ha ha. Yesterday we gave you Chinese government message to you Americans, take your fentanyl and die.
[33:51.000 --> 34:04.000]  But now here's a new message from Central Committee of Communist China about a message to you to set your mouths on Mark Zuckerberg, get mad and ban you with social score. Ha ha ha.
[34:04.000 --> 34:16.000]  The thing to do is let down to tyrants. They'd be much nicer. Now, again, my friends, here is my leader in China with message to you dirty pigs.
[34:16.000 --> 34:32.000]  The ministry of truth. Ah, present. Oh, the chai comms dragon. Ha ha.
[34:32.000 --> 34:48.000]  We are working with Silicon Valley to make you behave yourself. Once we have full control, we send you to re-education camp like we do our people when they talk back to the party.
[34:48.000 --> 35:04.000]  Whatever you do, do not visit band.video. Band.video is evil Americans who Silicon Valley is teaching to shut up like China.
[35:04.000 --> 35:16.000]  I'm watching. Don't you ever visit Band.video. Whatever you do, don't tell people what the mouth. Ha ha ha.
[35:16.000 --> 35:28.000]  Having a little bit of fun. Yeah, we're going to start having messages from the chai comms daily here. And we've got something special. You see the chai comm dragon fentanyl is his name.
[35:28.000 --> 35:36.000]  He's got a bunch of friends that are going to start being on the show every week. We're going to introduce you a whole cast.
[35:36.000 --> 35:48.000]  And I think we're going to make a little film with our friends, a future film about how they're going to help us once they get full control.
[35:48.000 --> 35:56.000]  So we're going to be laying all that out. All right, let's get serious. Very serious right now on this Friday edition.
[35:56.000 --> 36:06.000]  I covered this yesterday, but I did not get into it for more than five minutes. And quite frankly, I need to harp on this for the whole show. I'm not going to.
[36:06.000 --> 36:18.000]  But I think you're going to agree with me that there couldn't be a bigger issue when it comes to the future architecture of human communications and society and civilization.
[36:18.000 --> 36:30.000]  This is an Orwellian system, the likes of which would make George Orwell and his worst nightmare blush in comparison.
[36:30.000 --> 36:46.000]  And I'm speaking about the fact that when you have voice print analysis, just one area of this, you can then create an algorithm very easily that can delete that voice off of all cloud servers.
[36:46.000 --> 37:00.000]  And then program all new devices in case someone ever tries to send that through them, that those devices will then either self destruct or report you to the authorities.
[37:00.000 --> 37:16.000]  And all the new smart devices from smart TVs to smart refrigerators to your so called phones to the assistance are listening are watching and are reporting everything back and are designed to do this.
[37:16.000 --> 37:23.000]  So I've been talking for 10 years, particularly about this coming before I even saw it in their white papers.
[37:23.000 --> 37:30.000]  And a few years later, it came out in their white papers, you can extrapolate their larger plan. Because if it's evil, they're going to do it.
[37:30.000 --> 37:38.000]  If you can think of it, they're doing whatever the worst thing is, that's the actual plan. I've just learned that.
[37:38.000 --> 37:51.000]  And so I remember when I was at the mall and iPhones had just come out like 1011 years ago and my ex-wife goes, Oh, I like this song hits a button, holds her phone up and finds out what is it.
[37:51.000 --> 38:00.000]  She goes, that's Shazam. And I went, Oh, that's what YouTube's using with key numbers or was that 12 years ago when they came out.
[38:00.000 --> 38:12.000]  And then they can, you know, tell if you're playing somebody's music and then claim it's copyright, even though it's people who are doing covers of it or versions of it that are satire that clearly is protected like Stephen Crowder, it still comes after you.
[38:12.000 --> 38:26.000]  So if you have that power, you can go out and block somebody's picture, their name, their voice, things they've written can be put in the database to be banned, where you can't say it, you can't share it, you can't speak it.
[38:26.000 --> 38:37.000]  And already, when I try to type something to somebody through the so-called iPhone app of text message, it won't let me type half of it. It's just all politically incorrect. It's incredible.
[38:37.000 --> 38:50.000]  And it's all being watched and controlled in live time with real humans able to access quality assurance and look at what you're doing in real time, including Apple officially moved early last year to China.
[38:50.000 --> 38:58.000]  And the Chinese government is the main force in Apple now running all this. And they're interfacing through Apple into their partners at Google.
[38:58.000 --> 39:14.000]  Yes, Chinese government is helping censor Americans. It's just so incredible. And it's all admitted. So remember three and a half, four months ago, Zuckerberg came out and said, Alex Jones is the highest level of band.
[39:14.000 --> 39:27.000]  Remember that. Alex Jones is the highest level of band. You will not say his name or his websites in any positive way or you will be banned, punished or banned.
[39:27.000 --> 39:39.000]  Well, I said, watch, this will next be used on the NRA because they also did this to the proud boys by having an FBI agent who was a leftist say, we've listed them as a terror group.
[39:39.000 --> 39:46.000]  Never did that. But even if you list someone, they're not convicted. I mean, I mean, how do you have for American citizens? You shouldn't.
[39:46.000 --> 39:54.000]  So that would be unconstitutional even if they did it. But no, an FBI agent told the newspaper they were being listed, the proud boys.
[39:54.000 --> 40:04.000]  Thousands of them lost their bank accounts, hundreds of their jobs, firefighters, police, their pay pals got taken away, people that would just interview them.
[40:04.000 --> 40:17.000]  In fact, Facebook said one reason I was banned is I interviewed Gavin McGinnis, who created the group just to have positivity about America and being proud to be a male and wasn't even in the group anymore when that happened.
[40:17.000 --> 40:27.000]  So this is how they operate. And they're very, very proud of this. So I said, look, they're going to list the NRA now as a terror group.
[40:27.000 --> 40:36.000]  And then they're going to start taking their bank accounts away. They're then going to start going after their members. Now, how did I know that?
[40:36.000 --> 40:47.000]  Because Bloomberg had written four or five years ago that he was funding local governments to declare the NRA an extremist or terror group so they could then be shut down financially.
[40:47.000 --> 41:02.000]  And then I noticed two years ago, LA passed a law that if a contractor or a city employee or anyone working with the city has been a member of the NRA or quote done business with an NRA affiliated group, you will not be allowed to do city business.
[41:02.000 --> 41:16.000]  How about discrimination? This is this is first marking you with a yellow star, but now marking with the NRA symbol. So I told everybody, first it's Alex Jones, and then it's going to be everybody starting with the NRA.
[41:16.000 --> 41:25.000]  It's the real target. Well, Beto said last week we want to take NRA members credit cards away and stop NRA processing cards. That's the headline.
[41:25.000 --> 41:38.000]  And now Facebook with 3 billion users now was 2.5 a few months ago. Instagram is now banning photos of people at gun ranges claiming they promote violence.
[41:38.000 --> 41:58.000]  Millie Weaver, mother, investigative journalist, no criminal record, Caitlin Bennett, college graduate journalism, no criminal record, amazing reporter. It was a photo of them over a year ago at a range of firing legal handguns. And it said this is part of an organized criminal organization that promotes violence or dangerous organization guidelines.
[41:58.000 --> 42:24.000]  I was listed a year ago by G2, really a CIA operation in the East Coast there in Boston, as a quote hate group. And in the report it says I have perfect credit, but because I've been listed by the Southern Primary Law Center, a God, a judge, a jury, as that I lost five merchant accounts, some of which I had 20 years.
[42:24.000 --> 42:41.000]  And then the rates went up. We have big problems. So this is economic hardcore sabotage. And it's here. So Trump's not doing anything. The NRA's sitting there. They've had internal attacks, shake ups. That's how they do it. They infiltrate you. They plant things on you. They threaten to kill your family.
[42:41.000 --> 42:57.000]  I couldn't imagine what people like Wayne LaPierre or Ted News would go through. I mean, I do know some of it behind the scenes, but we're all under attack. This is a war, people. They're coming for your children. They're coming for your land, your God, everything.
[42:57.000 --> 43:13.000]  We sold Secret 12 for four years, and it was our number third best seller. We had to discontinue it because when you upgrade a formula, you are supposed to rename it. That new formula is Ultra 12. It's twice as strong as Secret 12, the very best vitamin B12 out there.
[43:13.000 --> 43:27.000]  It's got the complex system that lets your body absorb it and it does amazing things, supports healthy nerve and brain cells, helps make DNA, helps the body produce energy, helps produce healthy blood cells, essential for proper nervous system functioning goes on and on.
[43:27.000 --> 43:44.000]  B12 deficiency is a serious problem that could cause anemia, fatigue, weakness, constipation, weight loss, depression, poor memory loss, asthma, vision problems, and low sperm count. Bottom line, folks, you need Ultra 12. It helps suddenly in full war. So it's a 360 win and it's 50% off for a limited time at infowarstore.com.
[43:44.000 --> 43:58.000]  Again, we can only run the special for the next two weeks or so while supplies last. Ultra 12, twice as powerful, half the price, 50% off right now at infowarslive.com.
[43:58.000 --> 44:18.000]  The last week and a half we've been running two specials that are the best deals in our history. 75% off the Total Gut Health Combo Pack. That's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight different products at over 15% off.
[44:18.000 --> 44:29.000]  It's incredible. We also have the Dust Till Dawn Info Wars AMP Impact, which makes it easy to take it in the morning and take it in the evening. 13 different key capsules that are incredible.
[44:29.000 --> 44:38.000]  You want to supercharge your life? This helps you remember to do it and the results for myself and many others have been nothing less than astounding. Plus, you can't beat it. It funds the information war.
[44:38.000 --> 44:50.000]  You have absolutely nothing to lose but not taking action. Believe you, the Deke State, Hillary, Obama, the NWO, they hope you don't support Info Wars in this urgent moment when they're trying to shut us down.
[44:50.000 --> 45:08.000]  So we've got a whole bunch of other specials running as well. Check them out. They're all about to end infowarsstore.com.
[45:21.000 --> 45:30.000]  And control and manipulate every facet of our lives. At first, they give you just a few basic things to do. Don't support Trump. Don't promote Alex Jones.
[45:30.000 --> 45:42.000]  And once you've submitted to that, well, don't say mother and father and, well, let us sterilize your children. Take these forced inoculations and here, take this Prozac pill and here, smoke this weaponized marijuana.
[45:42.000 --> 45:52.000]  Oh, don't be a Christian. This is truly the market to be system and we're on air right now covering it and you're awake. You're involved. You're engaged. You're an ambassador of truth.
[45:52.000 --> 46:13.000]  You're begging you for yourself and myself and my family and your family. Spread the word about infowars.com. The live shows right now.
[46:22.000 --> 46:44.000]  And we are just mortal flawed human beings that need to seek God's countenance, God's discernment and to pray for peace and to pray for transparency and to pray that the very twisted evil forces on this planet trying to start a world war will be exposed
[46:44.000 --> 46:56.000]  to their attempts at creating even bigger global crisis will be stopped. Now, we'll probably avert a new world war, hopefully, but it's already tilting towards a global depression because of energy crises.
[46:56.000 --> 47:14.000]  We're covering it all live on the radio at infowars.com. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:26.000 --> 47:42.000]  We've got Eddie Bravo and Sam Tripoli coming in for an hour and a half. We are going to have a debate about science. We got a special guest in the third hour joining them and leave it at that until they join us.
[47:42.000 --> 47:55.000]  But I'm going to air the Kanye West piece in the sixth after where he said, we got to love Jesus and we don't just need to say, oh, I'm a good person. That's the road to hell. You got to say Jesus Christ.
[47:55.000 --> 48:05.000]  That's where the real power and the protection is and it really is. The enemy really hates it. It's real. We're going to talk about that and that turns some folks off out there.
[48:05.000 --> 48:13.000]  Listen, I'm not going to criticize you because you don't believe in God or the metaphysical or because you grew up in a house where your parents beat the hell out of you or something.
[48:13.000 --> 48:28.000]  And they were kind of Christian oids and that put the bad taste in your mouth. That was the devil. I'm telling you the discernment and the understanding and what gives me the ability to know what the enemy's going to do before they do it is my relationship with God.
[48:28.000 --> 48:43.000]  And I understand God's plan, at least at my level, and I understand that God has put me through a lot of things that were all done so that I could handle what's happening now and handle things even heavier and a lot bigger.
[48:43.000 --> 48:47.000]  I mean, I know I've asked for this and God put on my heart many years ago.
[48:47.000 --> 48:54.000]  Okay, you want to take on evil. You're going to have to pay for it and it's going to be really painful, but you will be victorious.
[48:54.000 --> 49:02.000]  And all I've seen is continued victory. And the enemy knows we've got God's standard. We've got God's spirit. We've got God's nod.
[49:02.000 --> 49:13.000]  And that's not something I say on a power trip. It's actually makes me shake. Only time I feel fear is that in the presence of God is very powerful.
[49:13.000 --> 49:25.000]  Obviously, just to even be anywhere near it is you do tend to shrink away. That's called the fear. That means God fear and means you've been in the presence.
[49:25.000 --> 49:36.000]  And you don't ever want to be out of the presence, but you still kind of want to get in the corner because it's love, it's strength, it's endlessness, it's all the answers.
[49:36.000 --> 49:52.000]  And it just makes you feel very, very humble. And then I see people who enjoy keeping people in the dark and who rebel and seeing people weak and people dumb and people poisoned and people deceived.
[49:52.000 --> 50:02.000]  And you run into this where you'll see some strong, successful, good-looking person and people around you will say, oh, well, he's not really doing too good or they're not doing too good.
[50:02.000 --> 50:09.000]  Or, oh, well, they're an idiot because they feel weak because someone else they perceive is stronger than them.
[50:09.000 --> 50:16.000]  Instead of seeing that as part of the human collective wealth as individuals, but our collective wealth.
[50:16.000 --> 50:25.000]  I mean, I see somebody who's doing great literature or great art or great music or great food or looks great or who's a great athlete and it doesn't make me feel smaller.
[50:25.000 --> 50:34.000]  It makes me feel richer, but see, that's the Christ energy. A Satanist sees you doing well as bad.
[50:34.000 --> 50:43.000]  But when you're confused and angry and upset and down and poisoned, I mean, they love children dying of cancer.
[50:43.000 --> 50:48.000]  They love half the women in the West having to have their breasts cut off.
[50:48.000 --> 50:57.000]  I mean, it really pisses me off how many women in my family have had to go through that BS and they 100% know it's the glyphosate.
[50:57.000 --> 51:05.000]  That's 90% of it. I mean, they didn't have any breast cancer in Brazil to speak of 30 years ago.
[51:05.000 --> 51:10.000]  They brought glyphosate in. Brazil's numbers have now matched ours.
[51:10.000 --> 51:14.000]  That's just one thing. And every time I go up to a counter and they go, you want to give money to breast cancer research?
[51:14.000 --> 51:18.000]  I want to say, and I go, no, and they go, oh, really? I'm going to go, yeah.
[51:18.000 --> 51:21.000]  You know the glyphosate runoffs, what gives you the breast cancer, honey?
[51:21.000 --> 51:26.000]  Oh, well, don't don't get on me. Hey, I'm just trying to tell you how not kill yourself.
[51:26.000 --> 51:32.000]  But you know, David Hogg says I'm not supposed to sell water filters because he tells you it's poison in the water and then he sells you a filter.
[51:32.000 --> 51:38.000]  Like that's a scam. See, he's never straight shot anybody in his life. So he doesn't get direct stuff.
[51:38.000 --> 51:45.000]  Like you better damn well filter your water for yourself, your wife, your kids, unless you like pancreatic cancer, unless you like bladder cancer,
[51:45.000 --> 51:48.000]  unless you like kidney cancer, unless you like breast cancer.
[51:48.000 --> 51:57.000]  Because the glyphosates in every damn water supply in this country, every damn water supply.
[51:57.000 --> 52:04.000]  But I'm digressing. I don't make me feel strong to have all this knowledge and then other people don't have it.
[52:04.000 --> 52:10.000]  Makes me feel upset. Then I learned over the years, a lot of people know the knowledge.
[52:10.000 --> 52:16.000]  You know what they do? They go join the other side and say, I know all this knowledge.
[52:16.000 --> 52:23.000]  Hire me. I'll help oppress the people. I'm ruthless. I agree. There's too many people, blah, blah, blah.
[52:23.000 --> 52:30.000]  And then they join it and serve it knowingly because they're so scared of it or they're enamored with it and say, well, it's in charge.
[52:30.000 --> 52:42.000]  It deserves to be in power. But I take one look at a Hillary Clinton or a Mark Zuckerberg or a Gigi Ping or a Gruber.
[52:42.000 --> 52:51.000]  And those people look like they're already in hell. They don't have real power. They're puppets.
[52:51.000 --> 53:02.000]  They've turned themselves into spiritual automatons, droids, robots, androids, facsimiles, other people's men, other people's women.
[53:02.000 --> 53:15.000]  Not me. I'm God's man. That doesn't mean that my flesh suit doesn't have some warts on it, but it doesn't matter.
[53:15.000 --> 53:21.000]  So I go back to that and we're going to play the Kanye speech. Hell, I'm not just playing the whole thing. It's like eight minutes long.
[53:21.000 --> 53:31.000]  And we got the guest coming up. But I've got all this incredible news here, but it's a wanton deception and turning yourself over to it.
[53:31.000 --> 53:39.000]  They're going to air it sometime next week. I'm not going to announce who it was and some of the podcasts I did in LA until it's about to happen.
[53:39.000 --> 53:51.000]  But let's just say that I got even more information and got even more informed about how the system works.
[53:51.000 --> 54:00.000]  I mean, I already know it. It's just one more example of how the system says, just come out against Trump.
[54:00.000 --> 54:04.000]  Just come out against the Second Amendment and you can have all this.
[54:04.000 --> 54:22.000]  And no matter how many times I see it done to my face, I cannot believe that they think it's an offer I would ever even consider giving up everything to sign on to death, to sign on to the collapse of civilization.
[54:22.000 --> 54:32.000]  And now computers are wired into everything. And the minute it all got wired in and the minute the 5G just turned on yesterday on my phone, I had to go block it.
[54:32.000 --> 54:42.000]  It's on in Austin now. The minute they got their guns on us, they pulled the trigger to just surveil everything, control what we say, control what we do.
[54:42.000 --> 54:50.000]  They can block any music, any text, any words, any voices. They can erase me off the Internet and they're already doing it.
[54:50.000 --> 54:57.000]  People are like, oh, how are you handling it? People are like, is it tough? Yeah, it's tough watching us all get put in this damn cage together.
[54:57.000 --> 55:04.000]  Well, how are you feeling? I'm like, you realize you're in the same cage. I'm actually aware of it.
[55:04.000 --> 55:09.000]  I could get out of it any minute and join the evil, except I wouldn't get out of it. I'd really get deeper.
[55:09.000 --> 55:28.000]  See, the globalists, let me show you a documentary on TV viewers, the globalists claim that their symbol is a pyramid and that they're up on top of it.
[55:28.000 --> 55:34.000]  But you know what that is. If you turn it upside down, right?
[55:34.000 --> 55:43.000]  This is third dimension. This is reality. This is where we are. It's a funnel into a black hole.
[55:43.000 --> 55:51.000]  They're not going up spiritually towards God, swimming up through the water, through the waterfall.
[55:51.000 --> 55:56.000]  Waterfall stops right here. They're going somewhere real bad. They're going down.
[55:56.000 --> 56:11.000]  It's the way our third dimensional brain perceives it. So you could tell me that the most beautiful women, all the money in the world, and helicopters, and so-called silicon eternal lifestyle here, it's all a fraud.
[56:11.000 --> 56:20.000]  It's all a lie. It's all a scam. And if people could just see that, there wouldn't even be a debate about all this.
[56:20.000 --> 56:28.000]  And see, that's why they're so scared that Kanye West is getting Jesus. Well, obviously he got Jesus. That's what this is all about.
[56:28.000 --> 56:36.000]  Got Jesus? I think I'm going to make a T-shirt. Got Jesus. That's such a good idea. I'm sure somebody else has done it, but I'm doing it. Got Jesus? Jesus won? Team Jesus?
[56:36.000 --> 56:40.000]  Because they hate that. They don't want me to say it. Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.
[56:40.000 --> 56:50.000]  Oh, Grandma, Baylor trained bad, but I'd say, you know, I just pray to Jesus, are you sure that's not in vain? All the Pharisee stuff. And she wasn't a bad person. She was a great woman.
[56:50.000 --> 56:59.000]  But the priest class tries to make those of us that have consciences all locked up. Are we perfect? Are we right? Are we walking in perfect holiness? I better not do anything.
[56:59.000 --> 57:12.000]  Instead of just saying, God, take me over. Make me a vessel against the enemy. Come into me now. I'm open. Whatever the cost.
[57:12.000 --> 57:19.000]  That's what you got to do. We're going to go to break, ladies and gentlemen. We're going to start the second hour and I'm going to hit a lot of the news.
[57:19.000 --> 57:32.000]  Tanya West, I'll get to all of it and so much more. And there's a lot of crazy news, but whatever you do, remember, remember, remember that they're counting on you, not caring.
[57:32.000 --> 57:40.000]  They're counting on you, not spreading the word. They're counting on you, not warning people as they put this digital, chemical, biological, spiritual straightjacket over us.
[57:40.000 --> 57:47.000]  They're not doing this because they're strong. They're doing it because they're weak and they're afraid of our potentials that we will reach.
[57:47.000 --> 57:56.000]  I was among the first 12 years ago to warn that Jeffrey Epstein was running a giant governmental blackmail ring using pedophilia.
[57:56.000 --> 58:08.000]  I was the first to warn of human animal hybrids and organ harvesting. I was the first to begin to warn that babies were being kept alive after they were born for their organs to be harvested.
[58:08.000 --> 58:22.000]  I was the first to warn you along with Paul Watson at Infowars.com 15 years ago that Google was using microphones and hidden cameras to record everything you do at hundreds and hundreds of other giant issues.
[58:22.000 --> 58:33.000]  Like the Federal Reserve being private, run for profit, trying to control our economy that our government in Hollywood had been taken over by the Communist Chinese on every one of these issues and many others.
[58:33.000 --> 58:44.000]  We've been dead on and we've raised the alarm on a planetary scale. That's why the globalists are trying to shut us down and that's why you are more critical than ever to support the Infowar.
[58:44.000 --> 58:48.000]  Please support the Infowar however you can.

[59:57.000 --> 1:00:13.000]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the infowar and say I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this but you want to fight, you better believe, you got one!
[1:00:13.000 --> 1:00:38.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[1:00:38.000 --> 1:00:48.000]  I always knew Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had a big problem with cultural appropriation.
[1:00:48.000 --> 1:00:54.000]  But to discover that he's an even bigger fan of blacking up than Al Jolson was somewhat of a surprise.
[1:00:54.000 --> 1:01:04.000]  Trudeau was pictured at a 2001 Arabian night party dressed up as a dark skinned Arab man.
[1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:08.000]  And in a second incident, which was even funnier, he blacked up again at a talent show.
[1:01:08.000 --> 1:01:17.000]  Warren Afro adopted a fake Jamaican accent and sang the banana bolt song.
[1:01:17.000 --> 1:01:35.000]  Now a third example of Trudeau blacking up has emerged. This time in a video where he makes stupid faces and exaggerate gestures.
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:48.000]  But Trudeau is laying on the boot polish so thick he ends up looking like Nightcrawler from X-Men trying to work out what's more idiotic just in Trudeau being a 29 year old teacher and browning himself up.
[1:01:48.000 --> 1:01:53.000]  Or the fact that he browned himself up to play Aladdin, arguably the whitest character in the movie.
[1:01:53.000 --> 1:01:55.000]  Aladdin, Canadian edition.
[1:01:55.000 --> 1:02:07.000]  Trudeau's so vehement about blacking up he even did the hands too. The video of Trudeau singing Deo in a Jamaican accent while wearing an Afro is the most in demand footage since there's a Prouder film.
[1:02:07.000 --> 1:02:11.000]  Ezra Levant has offered $10,000 for the video.
[1:02:11.000 --> 1:02:15.000]  I'll offer 20 grand for anyone to turn this over. It's that funny.
[1:02:15.000 --> 1:02:17.000]  Trudeau's new profile pic.
[1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:24.000]  But Paul, this was just a youthful indiscretion. Surely this is just another example of the cancel culture that you oppose.
[1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:26.000]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:29.000]  Let the person who has never done anything they regret in high school cast the first stone.
[1:02:29.000 --> 1:02:31.000]  Silence! Enough said!
[1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:34.000]  This federal election campaign is in the gutters and I am disgusted.
[1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:39.000]  He was 29 years old. He was a teacher. Not a school child.
[1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:43.000]  Also, it was 2001, not 1951.
[1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:51.000]  In 2001, blacking up was starting to be seen as a little bit dodgy to say the least, but it didn't stop Trudeau.
[1:02:51.000 --> 1:02:53.000]  No, no, no, no.
[1:02:53.000 --> 1:02:57.000]  And thirdly, Trudeau helped make this bed so he can lie in it.
[1:02:57.000 --> 1:03:03.000]  His entire election campaign was predicated on exploiting identity politics to score cheap points.
[1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:05.000]  Because it's 2015.
[1:03:05.000 --> 1:03:13.000]  So when Trudeau himself becomes a casualty of the mob outrage PC culture he helped build, forgive me for having little sympathy.
[1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:18.000]  We like to say people kind, not necessarily mankind. This is more inclusive.
[1:03:18.000 --> 1:03:23.000]  Trudeau is just another victim of the progressive retroactive purity test.
[1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:28.000]  The rules to which are updated every day so nobody is ever able to keep up with them.
[1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:31.000]  The very beast that birthed the cancel culture.
[1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:37.000]  Identity politics eats its own once again and the world's tiniest violin plays.
[1:03:37.000 --> 1:03:38.000]  Glorious!
[1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:43.000]  You've also got the irony of one of the world's biggest anti-racism virtue signals.
[1:03:43.000 --> 1:03:47.000]  Someone at the forefront of anti-racist strategies for Canada.
[1:03:47.000 --> 1:03:50.000]  Having blacked up on at least three separate occasions.
[1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:52.000]  Again, glorious.
[1:03:52.000 --> 1:03:53.000]  Oh yeah, and another thing.
[1:03:53.000 --> 1:03:55.000]  What's he's hand doing?
[1:03:55.000 --> 1:03:56.000]  Forget about blackface.
[1:03:56.000 --> 1:03:58.000]  This is Trudeau's me too moment.
[1:03:58.000 --> 1:04:04.000]  And of course he's already being forgiven by all the lefties because, you know, they have no morals or principles whatsoever.
[1:04:04.000 --> 1:04:11.000]  If you're not sufficiently woken up, not being racist is now apparently racist.
[1:04:11.000 --> 1:04:18.000]  Sorry, white people, but trying too hard not to be racist is low-key kind of racist.
[1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:19.000]  Checkmate bigots.
[1:04:19.000 --> 1:04:25.000]  But if you're on the left and claim to be woke, you can repeatedly black up, adopt fake black accents
[1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:30.000]  where afros make fun of black people in Arabs and how does the left react?
[1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:31.000]  No big deal.
[1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:34.000]  For today, just in Trudeau is cancelled.
[1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:36.000]  Hoisted by his own patard.
[1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:37.000]  People kind?
[1:04:37.000 --> 1:04:38.000]  But will he resign?
[1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:44.000]  Probably not. Politicians on the left can literally dress up in clan robes and nothing happens.
[1:04:44.000 --> 1:04:48.000]  As ever, it's one rule for them and another for the rest of us.
[1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:57.000]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[1:05:02.000 --> 1:05:08.000]  The last week and a half we've been running two specials that are the best deals in our history.
[1:05:08.000 --> 1:05:12.000]  75% off the Total Gut Health combo pack.
[1:05:12.000 --> 1:05:18.000]  That's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight different products at over 50% off.
[1:05:18.000 --> 1:05:19.000]  It's incredible.
[1:05:19.000 --> 1:05:24.000]  We also have the Dust Till Dawn InfoWars AMP Impact, which makes it easy to take it in the morning
[1:05:24.000 --> 1:05:25.000]  and take it in the evening.
[1:05:25.000 --> 1:05:28.000]  13 different key capsules that are incredible.
[1:05:28.000 --> 1:05:30.000]  You want to supercharge your life?
[1:05:30.000 --> 1:05:35.000]  This helps you remember to do it and the results for myself and many others have been nothing less than astounding.
[1:05:35.000 --> 1:05:36.000]  Plus, you can't beat it.
[1:05:36.000 --> 1:05:37.000]  It funds the information war.
[1:05:37.000 --> 1:05:41.000]  You have absolutely nothing to lose, but not taking action.
[1:05:41.000 --> 1:05:47.000]  Believe you, the Deke State, Hillary, Obama, the NWO, they hope you don't support InfoWars
[1:05:47.000 --> 1:05:49.000]  in this urgent moment when they're trying to shut us down.
[1:05:49.000 --> 1:05:52.000]  So, we've got a whole bunch of other specials running as well.
[1:05:52.000 --> 1:05:53.000]  Check them out.
[1:05:53.000 --> 1:05:54.000]  They're all about to end.
[1:05:54.000 --> 1:06:21.000]  All right, we talked about this yesterday and we've got some big guests coming in studio again today and a lot of breaking news.
[1:06:21.000 --> 1:06:26.000]  I want to talk about Kanye West because he's really done the big no-no.
[1:06:26.000 --> 1:06:30.000]  He hasn't just said America is a great place and we have a lot of resources.
[1:06:30.000 --> 1:06:34.000]  We have a great history and we should focus on that more and we should come together.
[1:06:34.000 --> 1:06:39.000]  But he's also talked about Jesus and it's about an eight-minute speech.
[1:06:39.000 --> 1:06:40.000]  It's got some singing in it.
[1:06:40.000 --> 1:06:41.000]  You name it.
[1:06:41.000 --> 1:06:45.000]  I wish it was an HD, but it was obviously shot by somebody with their phone.
[1:06:45.000 --> 1:06:48.000]  But it's still very important and very intelligible.
[1:06:48.000 --> 1:06:55.000]  Kanye West preaches radical obedience to Jesus during Sunday services in Atlanta.
[1:06:55.000 --> 1:07:02.000]  And so, I've got all these articles here about devil worship exploding, human sacrifice exploding, little kids being found sacrificed all over,
[1:07:02.000 --> 1:07:09.000]  how Mexican cartels, girls assassins bathed in the blood of their victims and have sex with the corpses.
[1:07:09.000 --> 1:07:11.000]  I mean, I'm not even looking for this and it's everywhere.
[1:07:11.000 --> 1:07:14.000]  MS-13 kidnaps little kids and tortures them to death.
[1:07:14.000 --> 1:07:16.000]  This is happening all over.
[1:07:16.000 --> 1:07:17.000]  This is real.
[1:07:17.000 --> 1:07:20.000]  This is the operating system of Satan.
[1:07:20.000 --> 1:07:24.000]  And whether you believe in God and the devil or not, the devil believes in you.
[1:07:24.000 --> 1:07:25.000]  God believes in you.
[1:07:25.000 --> 1:07:30.000]  And these people believe they're resonating with this evil entity that demands his fealty.
[1:07:30.000 --> 1:07:35.000]  But you're also seeing for every action and opposite and equal reaction, Newtonian physics.
[1:07:35.000 --> 1:07:40.000]  You're seeing a lot of people wake up and realize that it is a spiritual battle on this planet.
[1:07:40.000 --> 1:07:46.000]  And there's some fallen one on this planet who doesn't like us and who is interdimensional and trying to hurt us.
[1:07:46.000 --> 1:07:48.000]  But God's trying to get us out of it.
[1:07:48.000 --> 1:07:50.000]  If he listened to God, if he listened to Jesus.
[1:07:50.000 --> 1:08:18.000]  So here's Kanye saying that name that they don't like to say.
[1:08:18.000 --> 1:08:20.000]  You hear that?
[1:08:20.000 --> 1:08:22.000]  He's not telling God what he wants.
[1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:49.000]  If I know there's nothing to humble God, nothing to humble God, nothing to humble God, nothing to humble God.
[1:08:49.000 --> 1:08:53.000]  We're not asking.
[1:08:53.000 --> 1:08:55.000]  You're not asking us to do the least.
[1:08:55.000 --> 1:09:18.000]  You know, people are like, well, at least how are we going to do the least when he did the most?
[1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:26.000]  I've seen him work miracles in my life.
[1:09:26.000 --> 1:09:31.000]  Work miracles in our life.
[1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:38.000]  You know, the devil presents so many flashy, shiny objects.
[1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:54.000]  I've seen everything that the devil could have showed you via TV, videos, car dealerships, jewelry, houses.
[1:09:54.000 --> 1:10:09.000]  I tell you, nothing beats God, nothing, nothing, and a sound mind, nothing beats God.
[1:10:09.000 --> 1:10:27.000]  A sound mind. Understand how things really work. Can't fool an honest man.
[1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:29.000]  Nothing.
[1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:43.000]  Let's not be concerned with the opinions of men at all, only the opinion of God.
[1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:50.000]  Let's not be concerned with the validation of men at all, only of God.
[1:10:50.000 --> 1:11:00.000]  See, that's leadership. By the way, I've seen a cell phone version, a crew phone.
[1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:13.000]  I know we say, oh, this is the culture, that's the culture.
[1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:18.000]  Stop conforming to your own destruction.
[1:11:18.000 --> 1:11:29.000]  Be radically in service to Christ is the only culture that I want to know about.
[1:11:29.000 --> 1:11:35.000]  We're going to come after him now, boy.
[1:11:35.000 --> 1:11:52.000]  Get four walls out of the four walls in the school halls.
[1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:59.000]  Our Father Christ Jesus, thank you so much for bringing me to the home where I was born,
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:06.000]  where my mother met my daddy, and where my mother met my daddy.
[1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:26.000]  Thank you for saving me, for replenishing me, for delivering me.
[1:12:26.000 --> 1:12:33.000]  I think Hollywood likes this.
[1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:38.000]  It's going to get real clear now, doesn't it?
[1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:43.000]  When I found out about you and got closer to you, I got closer to my children.
[1:12:43.000 --> 1:12:49.000]  I got closer to my family.
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:58.000]  The devil had me chasing a gold statue.
[1:12:58.000 --> 1:13:02.000]  This is an insult to have it, stupid Oscar, peace prizes.
[1:13:02.000 --> 1:13:06.000]  Had me chasing cars, had me chasing numbers.
[1:13:06.000 --> 1:13:10.000]  We didn't know what Billboard was when we was first making music back in Chicago.
[1:13:10.000 --> 1:13:13.000]  Back when I was 14 in my mama career, we didn't know what the numbers was.
[1:13:13.000 --> 1:13:18.000]  Now I'd be all over the internet, like, oh, you only sold this much.
[1:13:18.000 --> 1:13:24.000]  The power of God cannot be calculated by a number, by a first week sale, by a five bank account,
[1:13:24.000 --> 1:13:31.000]  by how many cars you drive, by how big your house is, and how many acres you got.
[1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:33.000]  It's God inside of us.
[1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:35.000]  It's God inside of family.
[1:13:35.000 --> 1:13:40.000]  It's God inside of friendship that we hold each other accountable.
[1:13:40.000 --> 1:13:44.000]  If you see somebody slipping, you tell them.
[1:13:44.000 --> 1:13:48.000]  They be coming at me like, why are you so judgmental?
[1:13:48.000 --> 1:14:02.000]  It ain't for me to judge, but I'm going to say what I see.
[1:14:02.000 --> 1:14:04.000]  That's another thing the devil tried to do.
[1:14:04.000 --> 1:14:09.000]  Why do you keep on speaking up so much?
[1:14:09.000 --> 1:14:13.000]  I'm just pointing to the word.
[1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:16.000]  And if we don't speak up, they come for our kids already, don't they?
[1:14:16.000 --> 1:14:25.000]  I was a family member who God has given a new chance at life.
[1:14:25.000 --> 1:14:32.000]  He went through something extremely tragic, and God gave him a new chance at life.
[1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:36.000]  And he's with someone, his girlfriend, so beautiful.
[1:14:36.000 --> 1:14:41.000]  He had definitely been prom king if this was his girlfriend back when he was in high school.
[1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:44.000]  But he ain't that ready to give.
[1:14:44.000 --> 1:14:47.000]  He got every reasons why he don't want, every reasons.
[1:14:47.000 --> 1:14:48.000]  That's what I said.
[1:14:48.000 --> 1:14:51.000]  We can speak incorrect English.
[1:14:51.000 --> 1:14:52.000]  English ain't our original language.
[1:14:52.000 --> 1:14:54.000]  No way to stop trying to be all impressed.
[1:14:54.000 --> 1:14:58.000]  Which somebody all like.
[1:14:58.000 --> 1:15:00.000]  So he has so many.
[1:15:00.000 --> 1:15:01.000]  My mom is an English professor.
[1:15:01.000 --> 1:15:08.000]  I can pick the choose when I want to ask for colloquialisms.
[1:15:08.000 --> 1:15:10.000]  But every excuse he got, I know the real reason.
[1:15:10.000 --> 1:15:12.000]  You still, you still in MDMs, bro.
[1:15:12.000 --> 1:15:25.000]  That's why, that's the real reason why you won't go get that ring and get right with God.
[1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:32.000]  The fathers, if it's a household next to yours that's lacking a father, you that father now.
[1:15:32.000 --> 1:15:35.000]  You speak up on that block.
[1:15:35.000 --> 1:15:42.000]  You set that example.
[1:15:42.000 --> 1:15:46.000]  There is nothing to.
[1:15:46.000 --> 1:15:48.000]  Powerful stuff, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:15:48.000 --> 1:15:50.000]  Absolutely true.
[1:15:50.000 --> 1:15:56.000]  We've let the liberals and the leftists run things and wow, they're creating hell on earth because they're devil worshipers.
[1:15:56.000 --> 1:16:02.000]  Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[1:16:02.000 --> 1:16:05.000]  Forget bunkers, you're not a live underground gopher.
[1:16:05.000 --> 1:16:07.000]  You need survivalist camps.
[1:16:07.000 --> 1:16:14.000]  The ultimate fully functional, off the grid, mobile survival bug outhouse that's well equipped and custom built to outlast any other RV or trailer.
[1:16:14.000 --> 1:16:16.000]  Bold statement, you bet.

[1:16:19.000 --> 1:16:21.000]  That's survivalistcamps.com.

[1:16:52.000 --> 1:16:55.000]  By James Dunn, available at Amazon Books.
[1:16:55.000 --> 1:16:57.000]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[1:16:57.000 --> 1:17:04.000]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[1:17:04.000 --> 1:17:12.000]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[1:17:12.000 --> 1:17:18.000]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[1:17:18.000 --> 1:17:22.000]  My blood pressure has normalized, my diabetes has totally improved.
[1:17:22.000 --> 1:17:27.000]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[1:17:27.000 --> 1:17:29.000]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[1:17:29.000 --> 1:17:37.000]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[1:17:57.000 --> 1:18:02.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, here we are already in late September 2019.
[1:18:02.000 --> 1:18:05.000]  2020 is going to be insane.
[1:18:05.000 --> 1:18:07.000]  The globalists are going to pull out all the stops.
[1:18:07.000 --> 1:18:13.000]  They're going to hit us with everything they've got and now I've got to remind you who have been in the trenches for decades.
[1:18:13.000 --> 1:18:17.000]  Many of you exposing the new world order, being laughed at, being attacked.
[1:18:17.000 --> 1:18:22.000]  Now is the time to be more involved than ever because people know you're telling the truth.
[1:18:22.000 --> 1:18:24.000]  We caught the globalists with their pants down.
[1:18:24.000 --> 1:18:30.000]  That's why they're trying to take us all off the air right now because they want to put out narratives and not be challenged.
[1:18:30.000 --> 1:18:35.000]  They need to now have air superiority, but they don't.
[1:18:35.000 --> 1:18:37.000]  They've shut up almost everybody else but us.
[1:18:37.000 --> 1:18:42.000]  That's why we have to stick together and spread the word about infowars.com,
[1:18:42.000 --> 1:18:45.000]  forward slash show, and band dot video more than ever.
[1:18:45.000 --> 1:18:49.000]  That's where the truth lies. That's where the American resistance is.
[1:18:49.000 --> 1:18:51.000]  We'll never back down. We'll never surrender.
[1:18:51.000 --> 1:18:54.000]  And thanks to you, we're going to keep fighting right through 2020.
[1:18:54.000 --> 1:18:56.000]  If you take action.
[1:18:56.000 --> 1:19:00.000]  Band dot video is the answer to censorship.
[1:19:00.000 --> 1:19:07.000]  Band dot video is the answer for libertarians, conservatives, nationalists, pro-gun, pro-life,
[1:19:07.000 --> 1:19:16.000]  pro-human individuals to have their own platform where videos banned by YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter are still available.
[1:19:16.000 --> 1:19:19.000]  We've launched it, ladies and gentlemen. It's now live.
[1:19:19.000 --> 1:19:28.000]  Band dot video. Band dot video isn't just going to be a home for Alex Jones or David Knight or Owen Troyer or Paul Watson band videos.
[1:19:28.000 --> 1:19:39.000]  We are building it to be a place where band memes are able to be posted and where a growing list of freedom-loving contributors are able to have a home free from being shut down,
[1:19:39.000 --> 1:19:46.000]  free from being censored, free from being silenced by big tech, the chai comms, the Hollywood scum, and the globalist.
[1:19:46.000 --> 1:19:51.000]  Freedom of speech has a home. It's called band dot video.
[1:19:51.000 --> 1:20:17.000]  America and the world is fighting back against tyranny at band dot video.
[1:20:17.000 --> 1:20:46.000]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. Well, I started the transmission off today.
[1:20:46.000 --> 1:20:53.000]  Getting into the fact that Facebook is leading the way in global censorship and authoritarianism.
[1:20:53.000 --> 1:20:59.000]  Even as bad as Apple and Google are moving to communist China and helping suppress their people and bringing censorship here,
[1:20:59.000 --> 1:21:10.000]  Facebook's gone further almost four months ago saying, do not say the name Alex Jones or infowars.com in a positive light or you'll be censored or kicked off the platform.
[1:21:10.000 --> 1:21:16.000]  They're now moving into cryptocurrency, banking, everything.
[1:21:16.000 --> 1:21:25.000]  We're building all the big tech companies are pushing in these big high rises that have coffin size apartments, which then jacked up property rates for everybody.
[1:21:25.000 --> 1:21:30.000]  It's just amazing how they treat us one way and everybody else the other.
[1:21:30.000 --> 1:21:36.000]  But Zuckerberg showed up in D.C. yesterday. I didn't hear about this. I've asked the crew to keep watch on it or I would have been there.
[1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:41.000]  And I guess they just snuck it up on folks when we missed it.
[1:21:41.000 --> 1:21:47.000]  Facebook declares it's a publisher can censor whomever it wants.
[1:21:47.000 --> 1:21:51.000]  And drugreport.com is linked to this article that we reposted.
[1:21:51.000 --> 1:22:07.000]  Check giant walking into legal trap. They're worth almost a trillion dollars.
[1:22:07.000 --> 1:22:10.000]  And they believe that they'll just be able to deal with those lawsuits and everything.
[1:22:10.000 --> 1:22:21.000]  But you know the lawsuits against yours truly are meant to end the first amendment for publishers.
[1:22:21.000 --> 1:22:28.000]  So Facebook thinks it is above the law, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:22:28.000 --> 1:22:37.000]  Look at this article Facebook has invoked its free speech right as a publisher insisting its ability to smear users as extremists is protected.
[1:22:37.000 --> 1:22:45.000]  But it's legal immunity thus far has been rested on law that protects platforms, not publishers. So which is it?
[1:22:45.000 --> 1:22:50.000]  Well you see everybody keeps obsessing over section 230. You can get them on that.
[1:22:50.000 --> 1:23:00.000]  But what about the defamation saying that you're the most banned person because you're evil and you're bad and then no one should say anything nice about you.
[1:23:00.000 --> 1:23:11.000]  Telling members of your cult that there's a default to only attack which actually encourages them to attack more.
[1:23:11.000 --> 1:23:16.000]  Stories linked up on drugreport.com in the middle column. I suggest you get it and you share it.
[1:23:16.000 --> 1:23:26.000]  But Congress must act against this and just the espionage angles of Apple and Google moving to China and the surveillance and the privacy violations they've done here.
[1:23:26.000 --> 1:23:31.000]  Oh they're trying to catch up now and tell you oh we've been listening to you forever. Now we're watching you.
[1:23:31.000 --> 1:23:37.000]  That's a headline Washington Post. Doesn't matter you've still committed all these crimes and as a people.
[1:23:37.000 --> 1:23:45.000]  We should have the collective will to say that's illegal which it is and move against these companies and break them up for antitrust.
[1:23:45.000 --> 1:23:51.000]  But the media focuses on section 230 which is important but not as important as the antitrust because these aren't just trust.
[1:23:51.000 --> 1:24:11.000]  These are oligopolies cartels or combines corporate cartels oligopolies or combines as they're known are groups of strategic monopolies working in concert to keep any competition.
[1:24:11.000 --> 1:24:22.000]  Be it financial cultural religious spiritual from ever getting off the ground.
[1:24:22.000 --> 1:24:28.000]  And that's why the big four tech companies have you looked it up.
[1:24:28.000 --> 1:24:38.000]  They buy up 98% of tech startups that ever begin to get off the ground even little companies that start making a few million dollars a year.
[1:24:38.000 --> 1:24:44.000]  They try to buy. I've had the globalists come around here and try to buy us.
[1:24:44.000 --> 1:24:50.000]  For a lot of money but then it wouldn't be impoverished would it know it'd be dead on arrival.
[1:24:50.000 --> 1:24:54.000]  Maybe they put a conservative on there like a never Trump or somebody.
[1:24:54.000 --> 1:24:59.000]  But that's how it works they go and they take Michael Savage off the air.
[1:24:59.000 --> 1:25:05.000]  They took all the sponsors and they go open Shapiro it's free market he's got a bunch of sponsors.
[1:25:05.000 --> 1:25:08.000]  Oh isn't that funny.
[1:25:08.000 --> 1:25:10.000]  Conservatives go watch this free market.
[1:25:10.000 --> 1:25:12.000]  Free market.
[1:25:12.000 --> 1:25:16.000]  You weren't watching that invisible hand of corporate fascism.
[1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:27.000]  So that's what they've been doing and that's why the Republican Party is turning blind out all the censorship and the cartel activity because they're fundraisers and their contributors.
[1:25:27.000 --> 1:25:36.000]  Don't want a bunch of young whippersnappers like Alex Jones out there that have their own giant audience bigger than anybody else's.
[1:25:36.000 --> 1:25:44.000]  They don't want a whippersnapper like Matt drugs pioneering with his own website that gets more traffic than the news site.
[1:25:44.000 --> 1:25:47.000]  And so they're trying to create systems and plans.
[1:25:47.000 --> 1:25:50.000]  Or today it's Alex Jones.
[1:25:50.000 --> 1:25:52.000]  Tomorrow it's the NRA.
[1:25:52.000 --> 1:26:00.000]  And I said that does pull up the date three four months ago when Facebook banned saying my name in a positive light.
[1:26:00.000 --> 1:26:02.000]  It was about four months ago.
[1:26:02.000 --> 1:26:08.000]  Facebook bans positive mentions of Alex Jones.
[1:26:08.000 --> 1:26:14.000]  And I said then I said the NRA is next as well as the Republican Party.
[1:26:14.000 --> 1:26:22.000]  And Facebook now bans Republican ads by the RNC saying we want strong women in the Republican Party.
[1:26:22.000 --> 1:26:37.000]  They said it affected a transgender because they saw it and that it was a woman that's now a man and she got her feelings hurt or he got his feelings hurt that he saw someone saying he was a woman.
[1:26:37.000 --> 1:26:45.000]  The existence of women hurt the she man he man whatever it is.
[1:26:45.000 --> 1:26:46.000]  So that's how it works.
[1:26:46.000 --> 1:26:49.000]  Yeah, they banned me on May day.
[1:26:49.000 --> 1:26:50.000]  Wasn't that funny?
[1:26:50.000 --> 1:26:52.000]  There's articles a few days later.
[1:26:52.000 --> 1:26:55.000]  May day on the commie day.
[1:26:55.000 --> 1:26:58.000]  Isn't that cute.
[1:26:58.000 --> 1:27:03.000]  And it's anybody they don't control anybody that they believe has influence.
[1:27:03.000 --> 1:27:06.000]  Think about that.
[1:27:06.000 --> 1:27:08.000]  And so this isn't about censorship.
[1:27:08.000 --> 1:27:10.000]  That's only one little pinky toe.
[1:27:10.000 --> 1:27:19.000]  It's about a surveillance grid watching everything and say and do in real time.
[1:27:19.000 --> 1:27:22.000]  And it's about then saying, well, just don't promote Nazis.
[1:27:22.000 --> 1:27:23.000]  Okay, well, I'm not a Nazi.
[1:27:23.000 --> 1:27:25.000]  I won't promote that.
[1:27:25.000 --> 1:27:27.000]  Oh, we're taking them off the air.
[1:27:27.000 --> 1:27:30.000]  Oh, don't promote two genders.
[1:27:30.000 --> 1:27:32.000]  Don't promote Alex Jones.
[1:27:32.000 --> 1:27:33.000]  Don't promote NRA.
[1:27:33.000 --> 1:27:40.000]  Don't show two women at a shooting range in a photo from a year and a half ago.
[1:27:40.000 --> 1:27:43.000]  Firing Glocks.
[1:27:43.000 --> 1:27:50.000]  Because that violates community guidelines as violence or dangerous organization.
[1:27:50.000 --> 1:27:52.000]  And it's saying we're banning gun owners.
[1:27:52.000 --> 1:27:54.000]  We're banning strong women.
[1:27:54.000 --> 1:27:57.000]  We're banning women that get off our plantation.
[1:27:57.000 --> 1:27:58.000]  We want domesticated women.
[1:27:58.000 --> 1:28:06.000]  We can sterilize and dumb down and have manless and childless to be processed in to a giant feeding vat.
[1:28:06.000 --> 1:28:07.000]  We turn into fertilizer.
[1:28:07.000 --> 1:28:11.000]  We put on the fields for the elite to dinner.
[1:28:11.000 --> 1:28:20.000]  Europe and Washington state have legalized using dead people as fertilizer.
[1:28:20.000 --> 1:28:25.000]  So there you have it, ladies and gentlemen, right there on screen for TV viewers.
[1:28:25.000 --> 1:28:27.000]  That's how they're doing it.
[1:28:27.000 --> 1:28:28.000]  It's how they're carrying it out.
[1:28:28.000 --> 1:28:29.000]  And it's here.
[1:28:29.000 --> 1:28:36.000]  It's a total architectural change of humanity, of our speech, an artificial system taking over to make humans obsolete.
[1:28:36.000 --> 1:28:37.000]  That's the admitted plan.
[1:28:37.000 --> 1:28:40.000]  And everything they're doing is for this post-human world.
[1:28:40.000 --> 1:28:41.000]  That's the only issue.
[1:28:41.000 --> 1:28:42.000]  That's what's happening.
[1:28:42.000 --> 1:28:44.000]  It's satanic.
[1:28:44.000 --> 1:28:45.000]  You don't believe in God?
[1:28:45.000 --> 1:28:46.000]  Call it aliens.
[1:28:46.000 --> 1:28:48.000]  Call it an evil spirit in the universe.
[1:28:48.000 --> 1:28:50.000]  Call it a mass insanity of the establishment.
[1:28:50.000 --> 1:28:51.000]  Call it selfishness.
[1:28:51.000 --> 1:28:56.000]  But what it really is, is the end of humanity as we know it in a horrible thing.
[1:28:56.000 --> 1:29:02.000]  When you have a pain in the neck, a real pain in the neck, back, shoulder or legs,
[1:29:02.000 --> 1:29:07.000]  you now have two convenient choices to get fast relief without taking another pill.

[1:29:57.000 --> 1:30:02.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, here we are already in late September 2019.
[1:30:02.000 --> 1:30:05.000]  2020 is going to be insane.
[1:30:05.000 --> 1:30:07.000]  The globalists are going to pull out all the stops.
[1:30:07.000 --> 1:30:09.000]  They're going to hit us with everything they've got.
[1:30:09.000 --> 1:30:13.000]  And now I've got to remind you who have been in the trenches for decades.
[1:30:13.000 --> 1:30:17.000]  Many of you exposing the new world order, being laughed at, being attacked.
[1:30:17.000 --> 1:30:22.000]  Now is the time to be more involved than ever because people know you're telling the truth.
[1:30:22.000 --> 1:30:24.000]  We caught the globals with their pants down.
[1:30:24.000 --> 1:30:28.000]  That's why they're trying to take us all off the air right now because they want to
[1:30:28.000 --> 1:30:31.000]  put out narratives and not be challenged.
[1:30:31.000 --> 1:30:35.000]  They need to now have air superiority, but they don't.
[1:30:35.000 --> 1:30:38.000]  They've shut down almost everybody else but us.
[1:30:38.000 --> 1:30:42.000]  That's why we have to stick together and spread the word about InfoWars.com,
[1:30:42.000 --> 1:30:47.000]  forward slash show and ban dot video more than ever. That's where the truth lies.
[1:30:47.000 --> 1:30:49.000]  That's where the American resistance is.
[1:30:49.000 --> 1:30:51.000]  We'll never back down. We'll never surrender.
[1:30:51.000 --> 1:30:55.000]  And thanks to you, we're going to keep fighting right through 2020.
[1:30:55.000 --> 1:30:57.000]  Give you take action.
[1:31:02.000 --> 1:31:08.000]  The last week and a half we've been running two specials that are the best deals in our history.
[1:31:08.000 --> 1:31:12.000]  75% off the Total Gut Health Combo Pack.
[1:31:12.000 --> 1:31:17.000]  That's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 different products at over 15% off.
[1:31:17.000 --> 1:31:18.000]  It's incredible.
[1:31:18.000 --> 1:31:22.000]  We also have the Dust Chill Dawn InfoWars AMP Impact,
[1:31:22.000 --> 1:31:25.000]  which makes it easy to take it in the morning and take it in the evening.
[1:31:25.000 --> 1:31:28.000]  13 different key capsules that are incredible.
[1:31:28.000 --> 1:31:30.000]  You want to supercharge your life?
[1:31:30.000 --> 1:31:31.000]  This helps you remember to do it.
[1:31:31.000 --> 1:31:35.000]  And the results for myself and many others have been nothing less than astounding.
[1:31:35.000 --> 1:31:36.000]  Plus, you can't beat it.
[1:31:36.000 --> 1:31:39.000]  Once you get into the information war, you have absolutely nothing to lose,
[1:31:39.000 --> 1:31:41.000]  but not taking action.
[1:31:41.000 --> 1:31:45.000]  Believe you, the Deep State, Hillary, Obama, the NWO,
[1:31:45.000 --> 1:31:49.000]  they hope you don't support InfoWars in this urgent moment when they're trying to shut us down.
[1:31:49.000 --> 1:31:52.000]  So we've got a whole bunch of other specials running as well.
[1:31:52.000 --> 1:31:53.000]  Check them out. They're all about to end.
[1:31:53.000 --> 1:32:14.000]  InfoWarsStore.com
[1:32:24.000 --> 1:32:29.000]  But now is the time to get the toothpaste, to get the fish oil, to get the bone broth,
[1:32:29.000 --> 1:32:33.000]  to get the high quality coffee, to get all the great products at InfoWarsLife.com,
[1:32:33.000 --> 1:32:35.000]  InfoWarsStore.com, and fund our operations.
[1:32:35.000 --> 1:32:40.000]  And through this weekend, we're running the big specials on more than 10 of our best sellers,
[1:32:40.000 --> 1:32:46.000]  like Ultra 12 and like Ultimate Bone Broth and Myco ZX and Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula
[1:32:46.000 --> 1:32:49.000]  and Eight Pack Power Stack at 67% off.
[1:32:49.000 --> 1:32:54.000]  These are the best deals ever, but they're only running through this weekend at InfoWarsLife.com
[1:32:54.000 --> 1:32:56.000]  or AAA 2533139.
[1:32:56.000 --> 1:33:23.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:23.000 --> 1:33:29.000]  We are working with Silicon Valley to make up a hero film.
[1:33:29.000 --> 1:33:38.000]  Once we have full control, we send you to re-education camp, like we do our people when they talk back to the party.
[1:33:38.000 --> 1:33:43.000]  Whatever you do, do not visit Band.Video.
[1:33:43.000 --> 1:33:49.000]  Band.Video is evil Americans whose Silicon Valley is teaching to shut up.
[1:33:49.000 --> 1:33:54.000]  And I chime at the last.
[1:34:19.000 --> 1:34:24.000]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[1:34:24.000 --> 1:34:30.000]  And we've got two really funny, great guys who are going to show down to Paramount Theatre tonight in Austin.
[1:34:30.000 --> 1:34:34.000]  We've got Sam Trevely and of course we've got Eddie Bravo here with us.
[1:34:34.000 --> 1:34:37.000]  We've got a special guest joining us for the next hour that I'll tell you about.
[1:34:37.000 --> 1:34:41.000]  In the next segment, we're going to have a physics debate here and a science debate.
[1:34:41.000 --> 1:34:44.000]  And by debate, I think it's good to have open ideas.
[1:34:44.000 --> 1:34:55.000]  But I had a former CIA case officer on a few years ago and he just throws out a discussion, not even about Mars, that there are human slave colonies on it.
[1:34:55.000 --> 1:34:59.000]  They ran thousands of headlines saying that I said there were human slave colonies on Mars.
[1:34:59.000 --> 1:35:01.000]  I did not say that.
[1:35:01.000 --> 1:35:03.000]  But remember, that's who the media is.
[1:35:03.000 --> 1:35:05.000]  Now Eddie Bravo is not going to be saying that.
[1:35:05.000 --> 1:35:09.000]  We're going to leave this mystery object that looks like it's not natural.
[1:35:09.000 --> 1:35:16.000]  A very, very symmetrical that's coming through our solar system at super fast speed about to fly past Mars.
[1:35:16.000 --> 1:35:21.000]  And amateur astronomers can go out and look at this.
[1:35:21.000 --> 1:35:25.000]  But we're going to debate space, the Earth, all of it next hour.
[1:35:25.000 --> 1:35:31.000]  Please just remember, listeners, there is a massive push and an attempt to take us off the air.
[1:35:31.000 --> 1:35:37.000]  Facebook is now announcing that they're creating their own special board above the law, three billion users.
[1:35:37.000 --> 1:35:43.000]  And that if you don't follow every political correct wish they want, you will be banned.
[1:35:43.000 --> 1:35:47.000]  And they're going to be part of this whole digital world currency.
[1:35:47.000 --> 1:35:49.000]  Stories up on drugsreport.com.
[1:35:49.000 --> 1:35:53.000]  Facebook declares it's a publisher can censor whomever it wants.
[1:35:53.000 --> 1:35:57.000]  Remember just a year ago, oh, we don't censor anybody, we just ban everybody.
[1:35:57.000 --> 1:36:01.000]  So we're running some big specials right now.
[1:36:01.000 --> 1:36:03.000]  They're going to have to end on Sunday or Monday.
[1:36:03.000 --> 1:36:08.000]  Because a lot of these are selling out, like DNA Force plus our overall amazing product.
[1:36:08.000 --> 1:36:10.000]  It sold out.
[1:36:10.000 --> 1:36:15.000]  Well, we have 50% off super metal vitality, cold pressed herbs that are great for your stamina and libido energy.
[1:36:15.000 --> 1:36:17.000]  You need to experience it for yourself.
[1:36:17.000 --> 1:36:20.000]  Plus it funds its operations, you can't lose.
[1:36:20.000 --> 1:36:27.000]  You get a free bottle of ultimate female force, which I had in here on my deal that was taken out of here.
[1:36:27.000 --> 1:36:30.000]  Murphy's Laws is spectacularly victorious.
[1:36:30.000 --> 1:36:32.000]  Now, just run me a bottle over here real quick. Thanks.
[1:36:32.000 --> 1:36:34.000]  It's that pink bottle right there.
[1:36:34.000 --> 1:36:37.000]  But I'll come over and get it. It's no big deal.
[1:36:37.000 --> 1:36:43.000]  It's just amazing again for stamina, libido, energy.
[1:36:43.000 --> 1:36:47.000]  And it's a free bottle of because I want your wife or your girlfriend to try it and just see what it does.
[1:36:47.000 --> 1:36:50.000]  Because people can take energy drinks all day. They can do things.
[1:36:50.000 --> 1:36:56.000]  But if you don't have the base for your hormones in your body and all the other things to operate, then it's not going to work.
[1:36:56.000 --> 1:37:02.000]  But if you've got the fish oil, if you've got the turmeric, if you've got number one, the good halogen,
[1:37:02.000 --> 1:37:07.000]  not the stuff they sell at the stores, that iodine will hold your stomach, real atomic iodine,
[1:37:07.000 --> 1:37:14.000]  we have to go get a license from the Food and Drug Administration via the Drug Enforcement Agency,
[1:37:14.000 --> 1:37:17.000]  even have it because you can use it to make a lot of stuff in its raw form.
[1:37:17.000 --> 1:37:22.000]  That's what's in our X2 and in our triadine X3.
[1:37:22.000 --> 1:37:27.000]  Here's ultimate female force. This is expensive for us to make, but I'm putting a free bottle in
[1:37:27.000 --> 1:37:31.000]  because I want women to experience how good it is. It's like the drier version.
[1:37:31.000 --> 1:37:34.000]  It's way stronger than supermodality. It's just not cold pressed.
[1:37:34.000 --> 1:37:40.000]  I want women, Dr. McCamshaw, please, I want women to experience, ladies and gentlemen, look how many there are in here.
[1:37:40.000 --> 1:37:44.000]  I mean, you go to the gas station, they got stuff that really works, but a lot of it's toxic.
[1:37:44.000 --> 1:37:48.000]  You take two or three of those, your girlfriends, you'll be bouncing off the walls.
[1:37:48.000 --> 1:37:53.000]  Well, this is the healthy version of that for the price of like two packets from the gas station.
[1:37:53.000 --> 1:37:58.000]  So infowarsstore.com, this is a lot of good times right here with your sweetheart, okay?
[1:37:58.000 --> 1:38:03.000]  And McCanye is looking over there at that. He thinks it's very exciting as well.
[1:38:03.000 --> 1:38:10.000]  So infowarslive.com, infowarsstore.com, or AAA-2533139.
[1:38:10.000 --> 1:38:12.000]  Thank you all for your support.
[1:38:12.000 --> 1:38:15.000]  Now, we've got Eddie Bravo and Sam Tripoli here with me.
[1:38:15.000 --> 1:38:19.000]  We're talking to you guys over a late lunch yesterday.
[1:38:19.000 --> 1:38:26.000]  And you were talking about living in Los Angeles and how Joe Rogan's talking about leaving and how it's like war of the world's there.
[1:38:26.000 --> 1:38:32.000]  It's like a zombie apocalypse is why, you know, had that day of the dead intro, Trioxin 9 earlier.
[1:38:32.000 --> 1:38:37.000]  But I was in LA to be on some podcasts. They're going to air next week. I'm not going to announce them yet.
[1:38:37.000 --> 1:38:46.000]  And some big ones. And I mean, it was just like Charlie Manson lookalikes everywhere.
[1:38:46.000 --> 1:38:49.000]  Needles all over the place, even by the airport feces.
[1:38:49.000 --> 1:38:53.000]  And that's what Joe was saying is anywhere you go in LA, it's kind of like that now.
[1:38:53.000 --> 1:38:57.000]  And then you were saying, Sam, it's the opium. It's the fentanyl.
[1:38:57.000 --> 1:39:01.000]  And I've talked to people in Austin. It's like doubled in six months, almost as bad as LA.
[1:39:01.000 --> 1:39:06.000]  And most of them are on cheap synthetic heroin, flooding us from China.
[1:39:06.000 --> 1:39:14.000]  So we're under a military attack from China and the leftist media is attacking Trump for trying to stop the fentanyl and acting like he's not doing a good job.
[1:39:14.000 --> 1:39:18.000]  I think that's one of the best things Trump's doing. So you guys live in LA, you've got the floor for this segment and the next.
[1:39:18.000 --> 1:39:20.000]  Let's get into the homeless crisis.
[1:39:20.000 --> 1:39:26.000]  Yeah. Well, a big problem in Los Angeles right now is that cities and states are shipping their homeless people to us.
[1:39:26.000 --> 1:39:32.000]  It's been busted. There are cities who put them on greyhound buses and send them out to us.
[1:39:32.000 --> 1:39:36.000]  You know, I do a joke about we don't have a homeless problem. We have a camping problem.
[1:39:36.000 --> 1:39:41.000]  These people are camping in the wrong places. They're camping on Hollywood Boulevard when they should be out in the forest.
[1:39:41.000 --> 1:39:49.000]  You know, I'm seeing the wilderness. This homeless problem we have is directly related to the opium wars of Afghanistan.
[1:39:49.000 --> 1:39:50.000]  I totally agree. Keep going.
[1:39:50.000 --> 1:39:58.000]  You know, and it's just basically while I'm trying to stop the homeless crisis, we have these two guys flirting over here with female boner pills.
[1:39:58.000 --> 1:40:04.000]  Okay. So anyways, let me keep trying to save the world while you guys play cutie patootie over here.
[1:40:04.000 --> 1:40:17.000]  The point is that all this stuff is directly related. Hey, while I try to stay the homeless, I want to give Al Jones of the first ever.
[1:40:17.000 --> 1:40:22.000]  They are not going to be out today. The first ever tinfoil hat, Texas comedy,
[1:40:22.000 --> 1:40:28.000]  massacre t-shirt that we are selling at the moment. We're going to get serious next segment. I went to you late and I apologize. Let's get really into the homeless thing.
[1:40:28.000 --> 1:40:29.000]  That's for you, dude.
[1:40:29.000 --> 1:40:32.000]  Thank you, sir. This is deadly serious. And I agree. I shouldn't be playing around.
[1:40:32.000 --> 1:40:37.000]  I should throw boner pills at my female lady pills at my friend. I'm trying to tell you that.
[1:40:37.000 --> 1:40:40.000]  What happened if Eddie Bravo took ultimate female force?
[1:40:40.000 --> 1:40:41.000]  I took one of those.
[1:40:41.000 --> 1:40:42.000]  Really?
[1:40:42.000 --> 1:40:44.000]  We'll see. Yeah, we'll see what happens.
[1:40:44.000 --> 1:40:52.000]  Thank you, Sam. Thank you. Show everybody what it looks like because it's a cool shirt, dude.
[1:40:52.000 --> 1:40:54.000]  I'll tell people where they get one.
[1:40:54.000 --> 1:41:00.000]  Look at that. You can go to tinfoil hat t-shirts.com. It is the tinfoil hat, Texas comedy,
[1:41:00.000 --> 1:41:04.000]  massacre part two because it's our second time in Austin. And that's for you, Alex Jones.
[1:41:04.000 --> 1:41:09.000]  That is a good looking shirt. And to be serious, you're a band guy too. You get censored.
[1:41:09.000 --> 1:41:12.000]  People have to support folks who are getting censored. So yes.
[1:41:12.000 --> 1:41:16.000]  Yeah, we got to. And it's just like, where's the censorship coming from, Alex?
[1:41:16.000 --> 1:41:22.000]  I mean, like, I'm hearing that it's like some mega group stuff, some Israeli stuff,
[1:41:22.000 --> 1:41:27.000]  some China stuff. Do you think the censorship coming from? Where's it coming from?
[1:41:27.000 --> 1:41:29.000]  I mean, it's outside influences, right?
[1:41:29.000 --> 1:41:31.000]  Let me tell you where it's all coming from. China.
[1:41:31.000 --> 1:41:32.000]  China is real.
[1:41:32.000 --> 1:41:36.000]  These global corporations are using China as a place that will work for them to run these takeovers
[1:41:36.000 --> 1:41:40.000]  and these attacks and debate a test censorship and control where they have no freedom.
[1:41:40.000 --> 1:41:45.000]  But its big corporations want to take over the planet and they want us to all be obedient little serfs and slaves.
[1:41:45.000 --> 1:41:50.000]  So they're bringing in classic authoritarianism. We're in the middle of a global revolution against freedom
[1:41:50.000 --> 1:41:53.000]  to then build a post human world.
[1:41:53.000 --> 1:41:58.000]  I agree with that. I think Israel's a little bit in on it too. I think they're part of the whole jam.
[1:41:58.000 --> 1:42:03.000]  Don't you think we're one rabies outbreak away from the zombie apocalypse?
[1:42:03.000 --> 1:42:10.000]  Like, if there was a rabies outbreak in the homeless community, they would basically turn into zombies, right?
[1:42:10.000 --> 1:42:12.000]  By the way, you're not joking. They're biting people.
[1:42:12.000 --> 1:42:16.000]  My cousin in Seattle got bitten by one. He was given one $10 bill.
[1:42:16.000 --> 1:42:20.000]  The other one bit him and the bite got so infected his organs felt he died.
[1:42:20.000 --> 1:42:24.000]  I feel Vaughn's cousin got bit by a gay guy.
[1:42:24.000 --> 1:42:27.000]  Well, getting serious here. Getting serious here.
[1:42:27.000 --> 1:42:31.000]  This is the organized collapse of society. They siphon off all our resources.
[1:42:31.000 --> 1:42:35.000]  Poison us. Poison our culture, not just with chemicals, but spiritually.
[1:42:35.000 --> 1:42:37.000]  You guys are in a good mood.
[1:42:37.000 --> 1:42:40.000]  Dude, I know we came in. You're all angry. We're fighting lizards together.
[1:42:40.000 --> 1:42:43.000]  Come on, man. This is team fight.
[1:42:43.000 --> 1:42:45.000]  How do you know I'm angry? I'm super happy.
[1:42:45.000 --> 1:42:48.000]  Dude, we saw you. I could tell you. I could tell you were a sack of diapers.
[1:42:48.000 --> 1:42:51.000]  I get a little angry in the first couple hours and I burn off some of this team.
[1:42:51.000 --> 1:42:53.000]  You know, I mean, they're looking at all the serious news. I get pissed.
[1:42:53.000 --> 1:42:56.000]  Yeah, dude. Kanye West is blown away by all the female voters.
[1:42:56.000 --> 1:43:01.000]  Never been closer to a new world war with the crisis in the Middle East
[1:43:01.000 --> 1:43:07.000]  with the Saudi oil fields destroyed half of their capacity.
[1:43:07.000 --> 1:43:09.000]  5% of world capacity.
[1:43:09.000 --> 1:43:12.000]  Whoever's behind it know this.
[1:43:12.000 --> 1:43:15.000]  There are powerful forces that want a global conflagration.
[1:43:15.000 --> 1:43:19.000]  And now is the time to be more aware of that than ever
[1:43:19.000 --> 1:43:23.000]  and understand how precarious our position is here on this planet.
[1:43:23.000 --> 1:43:30.000]  And that we are just mortal flawed human beings that need to seek God's countenance, God's discernment
[1:43:30.000 --> 1:43:34.000]  and to pray for peace and to pray for transparency
[1:43:34.000 --> 1:43:37.000]  and to pray that the very twisted evil forces on this planet
[1:43:37.000 --> 1:43:41.000]  trying to start a world war will be exposed in their attempts
[1:43:41.000 --> 1:43:44.000]  at creating even bigger global crisis will be stopped.
[1:43:44.000 --> 1:43:47.000]  Now, we'll probably avert a new world war, hopefully,
[1:43:47.000 --> 1:43:53.000]  but it's already tilting towards a global depression because of energy crisis.
[1:43:53.000 --> 1:44:18.000]  We're covering it all live on the radio at m4s.com.
[1:44:23.000 --> 1:44:25.000]  It goes on and on.
[1:44:54.000 --> 1:45:00.000]  Happy's is a tincture that you take under the tongue.
[1:45:00.000 --> 1:45:02.000]  It was selling it for over a year.
[1:45:02.000 --> 1:45:08.000]  It's a private label of one of the top national sellers of herbs that's known to calm the body
[1:45:08.000 --> 1:45:09.000]  but not be a depressant.
[1:45:09.000 --> 1:45:12.000]  Now, despite the fact that I've never really promoted or cut an ad for it,
[1:45:12.000 --> 1:45:14.000]  it's in our top 10 best sellers.
[1:45:14.000 --> 1:45:19.000]  And right now, for those of you that haven't tried it, you can get it for 50% off.

[1:45:23.000 --> 1:45:28.000]  But ashwagandha root, rhodiola root, passionflower herb, green tea leaf,
[1:45:28.000 --> 1:45:34.000]  and licorice root is known to be so good for us and to smooth us out in a calm, good way.

[1:46:19.000 --> 1:46:23.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:46:23.000 --> 1:46:49.000]  Well, here's what President Trump said after visiting the open sewer of feces and needles.
[1:46:49.000 --> 1:46:55.000]  I'm not kidding, you go a couple blocks, you see angry vicious people pissing everywhere,
[1:46:55.000 --> 1:46:59.000]  yelling at you, demanding money, and all being worshiped by the left.
[1:46:59.000 --> 1:47:00.000]  What's the plan?
[1:47:00.000 --> 1:47:01.000]  What's behind it?
[1:47:01.000 --> 1:47:05.000]  Here's President Trump saying you'll send in the EPA because the amount of feces running off into creeks
[1:47:05.000 --> 1:47:10.000]  is killing the fish in the open public toilets that are blue cities.
[1:47:10.000 --> 1:47:14.000]  We're going to get involved very soon on a federal basis if they don't clean up their act.
[1:47:14.000 --> 1:47:18.000]  You have tents all over the place and you really have a sanitary condition
[1:47:18.000 --> 1:47:24.000]  because this water is rushing into the ocean and this is supposed to be stormwater.
[1:47:24.000 --> 1:47:27.000]  It's not supposed to be sewage and it's turning out to be sewage.
[1:47:27.000 --> 1:47:31.000]  And if these Democrat liberal politicians don't straighten out,
[1:47:31.000 --> 1:47:33.000]  the federal government will have to come in.
[1:47:33.000 --> 1:47:34.000]  Well, wait a minute.
[1:47:34.000 --> 1:47:40.000]  Why don't we just identify the sewage as clean rainwater and let it change its gender to clean rainwater?
[1:47:40.000 --> 1:47:41.000]  Let's say that.
[1:47:41.000 --> 1:47:42.000]  Yeah, dude.
[1:47:42.000 --> 1:47:43.000]  Good idea.
[1:47:43.000 --> 1:47:44.000]  Yeah.
[1:47:44.000 --> 1:47:45.000]  Yeah.
[1:47:45.000 --> 1:47:48.000]  All right, I interrupted you. I apologize, gentlemen.
[1:47:48.000 --> 1:47:49.000]  You live out in LA.
[1:47:49.000 --> 1:47:51.000]  Ground zero for this.
[1:47:51.000 --> 1:47:53.000]  Maybe Seattle, maybe Portland's worse.
[1:47:53.000 --> 1:47:57.000]  They passed laws in places like Portland saying pooping on the streets are right.
[1:47:57.000 --> 1:47:59.000]  Cleaning it off is racist.
[1:47:59.000 --> 1:48:00.000]  I'm not kidding.
[1:48:00.000 --> 1:48:02.000]  I'm sure the headline is Seattle on that.
[1:48:02.000 --> 1:48:03.000]  Why do you think it's happening?
[1:48:03.000 --> 1:48:04.000]  How bad is it?
[1:48:04.000 --> 1:48:05.000]  Where's it going?
[1:48:05.000 --> 1:48:06.000]  I don't mind people setting up tents.
[1:48:06.000 --> 1:48:07.000]  That doesn't bother me.
[1:48:07.000 --> 1:48:10.000]  But what does bother me is the filth they leave behind.
[1:48:10.000 --> 1:48:17.000]  If you should be appreciative that no one's arresting you for just setting up a tent on the sidewalk.
[1:48:17.000 --> 1:48:23.000]  But if you don't clean your shit up, I'm totally, I don't mind them setting up tents better than boxes and shit.
[1:48:23.000 --> 1:48:25.000]  Back when I was growing up, if you were homeless, you were in a box.
[1:48:25.000 --> 1:48:26.000]  Now they got tents.
[1:48:26.000 --> 1:48:28.000]  They finally figured that shit out.
[1:48:28.000 --> 1:48:29.000]  You can't do machine gun cussing.
[1:48:29.000 --> 1:48:30.000]  Oh.
[1:48:30.000 --> 1:48:31.000]  Because then it kills our delay.
[1:48:31.000 --> 1:48:32.000]  Oh my God, I'm sorry.
[1:48:32.000 --> 1:48:33.000]  What did I say?
[1:48:33.000 --> 1:48:35.000]  When you do it over and over again, we can't stop it.
[1:48:35.000 --> 1:48:40.000]  And again, CNN gets to cuss, all liberal channels do.
[1:48:40.000 --> 1:48:42.000]  We're not allowed to, we're seen as conservatives.
[1:48:42.000 --> 1:48:49.000]  We're held to, they can literally say F words, S words, all over CNN, all over ABC.
[1:48:49.000 --> 1:48:50.000]  You notice they do that now.
[1:48:50.000 --> 1:48:52.000]  We are not allowed because we're conservatives.
[1:48:52.000 --> 1:48:57.000]  Hey Alex, is it a side effect of female boner pills that you cuss a lot?
[1:48:57.000 --> 1:49:00.000]  He takes one of these and now suddenly he's in trunks.
[1:49:00.000 --> 1:49:01.000]  Hey, let's be serious.
[1:49:01.000 --> 1:49:04.000]  All the female forces are about stamina, libido, energy and focus.
[1:49:04.000 --> 1:49:07.000]  The other side effect is that it makes women swing from chandeliers.
[1:49:07.000 --> 1:49:08.000]  Yeah, dude.
[1:49:08.000 --> 1:49:09.000]  We don't want that.
[1:49:09.000 --> 1:49:13.000]  My buddy had an open relationship with a girl and she ended up hooking up with everybody
[1:49:13.000 --> 1:49:14.000]  in her block.
[1:49:14.000 --> 1:49:16.000]  But anyways, yeah, the homeless problem is like that.
[1:49:16.000 --> 1:49:17.000]  Well, it's a healthy girl.
[1:49:17.000 --> 1:49:18.000]  Hey, let's get serious.
[1:49:18.000 --> 1:49:20.000]  Lacey has a certain zest for life.
[1:49:20.000 --> 1:49:22.000]  I won't tell anybody.
[1:49:22.000 --> 1:49:23.000]  Good.
[1:49:23.000 --> 1:49:24.000]  Oh, good.
[1:49:24.000 --> 1:49:26.000]  Can we get serious?
[1:49:26.000 --> 1:49:27.000]  Please.
[1:49:27.000 --> 1:49:28.000]  Get back to the crisis here.
[1:49:28.000 --> 1:49:29.000]  Please.
[1:49:29.000 --> 1:49:33.000]  I think if you leave trash, you should, like, if you leave all that out.
[1:49:33.000 --> 1:49:36.000]  If you leave all that filth on the street, you should be arrested.
[1:49:36.000 --> 1:49:37.000]  That's what I think.
[1:49:37.000 --> 1:49:39.000]  I don't think they care about being arrested.
[1:49:39.000 --> 1:49:43.000]  I think the problem is, is like, how do we get this?
[1:49:43.000 --> 1:49:44.000]  How do we stop this?
[1:49:44.000 --> 1:49:48.000]  And I'm telling you, it's all directed to the opium warbs of Afghanistan.
[1:49:48.000 --> 1:49:54.000]  Dude, after we went in and we kicked the Taliban out, we put our troops around these, these
[1:49:54.000 --> 1:49:57.000]  crops of opium and production went up 70%.
[1:49:57.000 --> 1:50:00.000]  And the flood and the use went up 70% of America.
[1:50:00.000 --> 1:50:01.000]  This is what we have.
[1:50:01.000 --> 1:50:03.000]  It actually went up 70% the first year.
[1:50:03.000 --> 1:50:04.000]  It went up, like, 300%.
[1:50:04.000 --> 1:50:07.000]  I mean, dude, Trump, I mean, like, let's give the guy credit.
[1:50:07.000 --> 1:50:10.000]  Listen, if you, you can criticize the man for the things you don't like.
[1:50:10.000 --> 1:50:12.000]  You gotta give him credit for when he does something right.
[1:50:12.000 --> 1:50:14.000]  And he's been trying to get the smack off the street.
[1:50:14.000 --> 1:50:19.000]  And he's trying, he tried, listen, dude, they tried to pull us out of Afghanistan.
[1:50:19.000 --> 1:50:24.000]  And then the Taliban, who doesn't want us there, suddenly decided to attack a base.
[1:50:24.000 --> 1:50:25.000]  It's like, come on, man.
[1:50:25.000 --> 1:50:27.000]  We know what you're doing there.
[1:50:27.000 --> 1:50:29.000]  It's false flag stuff to keep us in Afghanistan.
[1:50:29.000 --> 1:50:31.000]  We want out of Afghanistan.
[1:50:31.000 --> 1:50:33.000]  We want enough of the opium wars.
[1:50:33.000 --> 1:50:34.000]  You're flooding our streets.
[1:50:34.000 --> 1:50:37.000]  It's like the crack epidemic of the 80s, man.
[1:50:37.000 --> 1:50:40.000]  The crack epidemic of the 80s, you flood the inner cities with crack.
[1:50:40.000 --> 1:50:46.000]  Now they're flooding all the, you know, middle-class white Americans with drugs and stuff like,
[1:50:46.000 --> 1:50:48.000]  it's this exact same game plan.
[1:50:48.000 --> 1:50:55.000]  Let's get out of Afghanistan and get rid of the opium that's flooding our streets.
[1:50:55.000 --> 1:50:57.000]  But you know, Sam.
[1:50:57.000 --> 1:51:02.000]  It is China helping you with fentanyl.
[1:51:02.000 --> 1:51:03.000]  Yeah.
[1:51:03.000 --> 1:51:05.000]  You know, most of it's from our friend, the little chatcom.
[1:51:05.000 --> 1:51:07.000]  Or how about the fact it's in MIT?
[1:51:07.000 --> 1:51:08.000]  How about that?
[1:51:08.000 --> 1:51:10.000]  MIT came up with fentanyl.
[1:51:10.000 --> 1:51:11.000]  What are you saying?
[1:51:11.000 --> 1:51:12.000]  So that's a great point.
[1:51:12.000 --> 1:51:13.000]  Explain to us about that.
[1:51:13.000 --> 1:51:20.000]  Well, basically it was discovered that fentanyl was basically like produced or like, I don't
[1:51:20.000 --> 1:51:26.000]  know, originated in MIT and Chinese scientists took it back to China.
[1:51:26.000 --> 1:51:33.000]  Guys, this, what's going on right now is all revenge for the British India opium war.
[1:51:33.000 --> 1:51:35.000]  I know, but we didn't do that in China.
[1:51:35.000 --> 1:51:36.000]  We saved it from the Japanese.
[1:51:36.000 --> 1:51:37.000]  So why are they doing it to us?
[1:51:37.000 --> 1:51:39.000]  Because they're commies working with the left.
[1:51:39.000 --> 1:51:40.000]  Yeah.
[1:51:40.000 --> 1:51:41.000]  Hey, man.
[1:51:41.000 --> 1:51:44.000]  I mean, it's 100% true, dude.
[1:51:44.000 --> 1:51:45.000]  So how bad is it going to get?
[1:51:45.000 --> 1:51:47.000]  Because Joe Rogan has said he's going to leave LA.
[1:51:47.000 --> 1:51:48.000]  Can he really do that?
[1:51:48.000 --> 1:51:49.000]  He's going to do whatever he wants?
[1:51:49.000 --> 1:51:50.000]  He's left before.
[1:51:50.000 --> 1:51:51.000]  No, no.
[1:51:51.000 --> 1:51:52.000]  He went to Colorado for a while.
[1:51:52.000 --> 1:51:53.000]  Yeah.
[1:51:53.000 --> 1:51:54.000]  Yeah.
[1:51:54.000 --> 1:51:55.000]  He can do whatever he wants.
[1:51:55.000 --> 1:51:56.000]  He's Godzilla.
[1:51:56.000 --> 1:52:02.000]  I never thought I'd ever leave California, but thoughts have been swirling in my head,
[1:52:02.000 --> 1:52:07.000]  you know, especially if they start cracking down hardcore on guns in California.
[1:52:07.000 --> 1:52:11.000]  And if they get any deeper, I don't know, maybe I'll move to Greenland.
[1:52:11.000 --> 1:52:18.000]  No, why don't you move, Austin's like a tentacle or a metastasization of LA, but outside of
[1:52:18.000 --> 1:52:19.000]  it's great.
[1:52:19.000 --> 1:52:20.000]  You should move to Texas.
[1:52:20.000 --> 1:52:22.000]  You can do a show, a late night show.
[1:52:22.000 --> 1:52:27.000]  So if Houston didn't flood, I would be there because I'm all about that Houston black ass.
[1:52:27.000 --> 1:52:29.000]  That's what I'm all about, dude.
[1:52:29.000 --> 1:52:33.000]  I love Houston black women and I would move there if I could.
[1:52:33.000 --> 1:52:35.000]  But unfortunately, Sam, it's a family show.
[1:52:35.000 --> 1:52:36.000]  Oh, okay.
[1:52:36.000 --> 1:52:37.000]  I apologize.
[1:52:37.000 --> 1:52:39.000]  Houston is awesome.
[1:52:39.000 --> 1:52:44.000]  We have our best shows there for sure.
[1:52:44.000 --> 1:52:46.000]  Maybe maybe I moved to Texas.
[1:52:46.000 --> 1:52:48.000]  Maybe Corpus Christi.
[1:52:48.000 --> 1:52:50.000]  How's the Texas?
[1:52:50.000 --> 1:52:51.000]  I'll move here.
[1:52:51.000 --> 1:52:52.000]  I'll say that.
[1:52:52.000 --> 1:52:53.000]  I'll move here.
[1:52:53.000 --> 1:52:54.000]  I'm definitely down.
[1:52:54.000 --> 1:52:55.000]  Texas is one of my...
[1:52:55.000 --> 1:52:59.000]  See, here's what I've learned, dude, is that like the filth one, the culture war.
[1:52:59.000 --> 1:53:04.000]  So when you go to red states, it's not really like, oh my God, it's like used to be with
[1:53:04.000 --> 1:53:06.000]  the Christian super like religious now.
[1:53:06.000 --> 1:53:09.000]  It's like everybody's swingers and it's just red states are just fun.
[1:53:09.000 --> 1:53:12.000]  Say don't take our taxes or our guns and let's all get weird.
[1:53:12.000 --> 1:53:13.000]  That's what I've learned.
[1:53:13.000 --> 1:53:16.000]  I think it's always been like that to a certain extent.
[1:53:16.000 --> 1:53:17.000]  Really?
[1:53:17.000 --> 1:53:18.000]  Yeah.
[1:53:18.000 --> 1:53:20.000]  But listen, we still love Jesus because we know the devil's real.
[1:53:20.000 --> 1:53:23.000]  You get to a certain point, the evil just takes over.
[1:53:23.000 --> 1:53:24.000]  Sadness, dude.
[1:53:24.000 --> 1:53:27.000]  It's more like sadness, black cube stuff.
[1:53:27.000 --> 1:53:31.000]  Let's bring up Israel because you can always just throw in the little Israel's evil running
[1:53:31.000 --> 1:53:33.000]  at all things.
[1:53:33.000 --> 1:53:39.000]  My issue is it becomes this third rail where people just do it as a touchstone and then
[1:53:39.000 --> 1:53:42.000]  all these magical powers are attributed to Israel.
[1:53:42.000 --> 1:53:44.000]  Netanyahu's in a coalition government.
[1:53:44.000 --> 1:53:45.000]  He may lose.
[1:53:45.000 --> 1:53:46.000]  He may go to jail.
[1:53:46.000 --> 1:53:48.000]  Everyone claims Netanyahu runs everything.
[1:53:48.000 --> 1:53:49.000]  No, there's a huge end fighting there.
[1:53:49.000 --> 1:53:51.000]  Israel's pretty much like the U.S. for sure.
[1:53:51.000 --> 1:53:52.000]  They're both in conservatives.
[1:53:52.000 --> 1:53:53.000]  Yeah.
[1:53:53.000 --> 1:53:57.000]  And so all I know is people never want to talk about the issues I want to talk about online.
[1:53:57.000 --> 1:54:01.000]  They're just like, oh yeah, tell us about how Israel tells you what to do because I'm
[1:54:01.000 --> 1:54:02.000]  not against Israel.
[1:54:02.000 --> 1:54:05.000]  If we got rid of Israel, it would just be the Muslims all killing each other.
[1:54:05.000 --> 1:54:10.000]  Saudi Arabia doesn't take any refugees in, but then we're supposed to take them all.
[1:54:10.000 --> 1:54:15.000]  I'm sick of the America bashing and now it's like segwayed into this sycophantic freak out
[1:54:15.000 --> 1:54:17.000]  about Israel all day.
[1:54:17.000 --> 1:54:21.000]  I'm just sick of hearing I work for Israel because I have nothing to do with it.
[1:54:21.000 --> 1:54:22.000]  I don't think you do.
[1:54:22.000 --> 1:54:23.000]  It's crazy.
[1:54:23.000 --> 1:54:24.000]  I don't think you do, but I listen, man.
[1:54:24.000 --> 1:54:25.000]  It's not that Israel.
[1:54:25.000 --> 1:54:26.000]  I love Israelis.
[1:54:26.000 --> 1:54:29.000]  I watch Israeli soldier twerking videos all the time.
[1:54:29.000 --> 1:54:30.000]  I love Israel.
[1:54:30.000 --> 1:54:32.000]  I know a lot of Israelis.
[1:54:32.000 --> 1:54:33.000]  They're wonderful people.
[1:54:33.000 --> 1:54:34.000]  It's no different than the U.S.
[1:54:34.000 --> 1:54:39.000]  At the highest levels, there's these Black Cuba Saturn people just like in the United
[1:54:39.000 --> 1:54:40.000]  States, just like in Europe, man.
[1:54:40.000 --> 1:54:41.000]  And of course that's what we're talking about.
[1:54:41.000 --> 1:54:44.000]  At the comma, they're worshiping the Black Cuba Saturn.
[1:54:44.000 --> 1:54:45.000]  That's what we're talking about.
[1:54:45.000 --> 1:54:47.000]  It's in all religions, man.
[1:54:47.000 --> 1:54:48.000]  It's not just one.
[1:54:48.000 --> 1:54:49.000]  There's no.
[1:54:49.000 --> 1:54:51.000]  Israel is just like anywhere else, man.
[1:54:51.000 --> 1:54:54.000]  It's just this all this money put in the propaganda.
[1:54:54.000 --> 1:54:55.000]  That's what I'm saying.
[1:54:55.000 --> 1:54:56.000]  They're people.
[1:54:56.000 --> 1:55:01.000]  The powerful elites do use city states like the city of London within London or Washington,
[1:55:01.000 --> 1:55:03.000]  D.C. that's owned above the law.
[1:55:03.000 --> 1:55:04.000]  There we go.
[1:55:04.000 --> 1:55:05.000]  How can you hate that?
[1:55:05.000 --> 1:55:06.000]  Stop guys.
[1:55:06.000 --> 1:55:07.000]  Come on.
[1:55:07.000 --> 1:55:08.000]  How can you hate that?
[1:55:08.000 --> 1:55:12.000]  Let's expand on this right now.
[1:55:12.000 --> 1:55:15.000]  Then you've got the city of London above the law.
[1:55:15.000 --> 1:55:16.000]  Israel has its own law.
[1:55:16.000 --> 1:55:18.000]  The Vatican has its own law.
[1:55:18.000 --> 1:55:19.000]  D.C. has its own law.
[1:55:19.000 --> 1:55:21.000]  The U.N. has its own cities.
[1:55:21.000 --> 1:55:22.000]  Its own immunity.
[1:55:22.000 --> 1:55:24.000]  So that's what you do at the top level.
[1:55:24.000 --> 1:55:28.000]  You're like, hey, we got our own city and own military and we don't pay taxes to anybody
[1:55:28.000 --> 1:55:29.000]  and you all got to kiss our ass.
[1:55:29.000 --> 1:55:31.000]  That's where the world government's going.
[1:55:31.000 --> 1:55:32.000]  Yes, dude.
[1:55:32.000 --> 1:55:33.000]  That's what we're talking about.
[1:55:33.000 --> 1:55:38.000]  So what happens is that everyone through identity politics wants to think groups go up and down.
[1:55:38.000 --> 1:55:40.000]  But they go like this, man.
[1:55:40.000 --> 1:55:42.000]  They go horizontal.
[1:55:42.000 --> 1:55:43.000]  It's class, man.
[1:55:43.000 --> 1:55:46.000]  So it's like these people at the top do all this crazy stuff and they make the people
[1:55:46.000 --> 1:55:48.000]  at the bottom fight with each other.
[1:55:48.000 --> 1:55:53.000]  Now, if Washington, D.C. is its own separate country or whatever, who is protected?
[1:55:53.000 --> 1:55:56.000]  Who specifically is protected by that?
[1:55:56.000 --> 1:55:57.000]  Washington, D.C., the president?
[1:55:57.000 --> 1:55:58.000]  Sure.
[1:55:58.000 --> 1:56:01.000]  What they do is they create their own districts that then have immunity.
[1:56:01.000 --> 1:56:04.000]  That's why it's wrong that the Democrats aren't supposed to be able to get a representative
[1:56:04.000 --> 1:56:07.000]  from that because it's its own separate corporate system.
[1:56:07.000 --> 1:56:11.000]  And it'll give up its corporate separate power in the system once it goes into the United
[1:56:11.000 --> 1:56:12.000]  States of America.
[1:56:12.000 --> 1:56:16.000]  But it was set up as a group that can also do corporate agreements with other countries
[1:56:16.000 --> 1:56:17.000]  and things.
[1:56:17.000 --> 1:56:19.000]  So it's a company, like the British East India Company.
[1:56:19.000 --> 1:56:25.000]  Hey, what about the fact that Disneyland or Disney World in Florida is a sovereign territory?
[1:56:25.000 --> 1:56:27.000]  It's not part of Florida.
[1:56:27.000 --> 1:56:30.000]  That's right, because anybody that knows how it works knows that you're not somebody until
[1:56:30.000 --> 1:56:32.000]  you got your own country.
[1:56:32.000 --> 1:56:33.000]  Yeah.
[1:56:33.000 --> 1:56:36.000]  And so once you got that, you got your own currency, you got your own system, you got
[1:56:36.000 --> 1:56:40.000]  your own immunity, and you got your own police and troops, and if anybody wants to take it
[1:56:40.000 --> 1:56:42.000]  over, they got to come take it.
[1:56:42.000 --> 1:56:46.000]  And that's why each of us has guns because we are our own entity and our own sovereign
[1:56:46.000 --> 1:56:47.000]  country.
[1:56:47.000 --> 1:56:49.000]  That's what America's about.
[1:56:49.000 --> 1:56:54.000]  Suck us and you ain't getting my guns, bitches, because I got my own media system.
[1:56:54.000 --> 1:56:56.000]  This is a family show.
[1:56:56.000 --> 1:56:57.000]  Not a family show.
[1:56:57.000 --> 1:57:01.000]  Well, you can say things like this.
[1:57:01.000 --> 1:57:07.000]  It's Friday, September 20th, as I'm recording the special message to the Info Wars audience.
[1:57:07.000 --> 1:57:11.000]  There is not a way for me to describe how awesome you are and how amazing you are.
[1:57:11.000 --> 1:57:16.000]  Literally, you are the individuals in the arena that have spread the word about Info Wars,
[1:57:16.000 --> 1:57:20.000]  that have supported us steadfastly, and have bought the products so we can stay on the
[1:57:20.000 --> 1:57:21.000]  air.
[1:57:21.000 --> 1:57:24.000]  And ladies and gentlemen, we've been under tremendous attack, as you know, because America's
[1:57:24.000 --> 1:57:25.000]  under attack.
[1:57:25.000 --> 1:57:29.000]  And the enemy has wounded us badly, I gotta tell you, but we've hung on longer than they
[1:57:29.000 --> 1:57:34.000]  did, but now is the time to get the toothpaste, to get the fish oil, to get the bone broth,
[1:57:34.000 --> 1:57:39.000]  to get the high quality coffee, to get all the great products at InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com,
[1:57:39.000 --> 1:57:41.000]  and fund our operations.
[1:57:41.000 --> 1:57:45.000]  And through this weekend, we're running the big specials on more than 10 of our best sellers
[1:57:45.000 --> 1:57:51.000]  like Ultra 12, and like Ultimate Bone Broth, and Myco ZX, and Body's Ultimate Turmeric
[1:57:51.000 --> 1:57:54.000]  Formula and 8-pack Power Stack at 67% off.
[1:57:54.000 --> 1:57:58.000]  These are the best deals ever, but they're only running through this weekend at InfoWarsLife.com,
[1:57:58.000 --> 1:58:00.000]  or AAA-2533-139.
[1:58:29.000 --> 1:58:31.000]  So many things.
[1:58:31.000 --> 1:58:33.000]  It sells itself.
[1:58:33.000 --> 1:58:41.000]  But, Normal Turmeric only has 3-5% curcuminoid, the active enzyme or system in the plant.
[1:58:41.000 --> 1:58:43.000]  Originally, obviously, from India.
[1:58:43.000 --> 1:58:49.000]  Well, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula has a 95% curcuminoid level, but it's got other
[1:58:49.000 --> 1:58:54.000]  natural things that help boost it, help your body absorb it, and that's why people absolutely
[1:58:54.000 --> 1:58:55.000]  love it.
[1:58:55.000 --> 1:58:58.000]  I'm doing this offer for people that haven't tried it yet.
[1:58:58.000 --> 1:59:27.000]  We're running 50% off on Body's at InfoWarsLife.com.
[1:59:28.000 --> 1:59:30.000]  We're broadcasting worldwide.
[1:59:30.000 --> 1:59:34.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:59:34.000 --> 1:59:36.000]  You guys are in a good mood.
[1:59:36.000 --> 1:59:39.000]  On InfoWars, why wouldn't we be in a good mood?
[1:59:39.000 --> 1:59:42.000]  Well, we need you to take some chill force now.
[1:59:42.000 --> 1:59:47.000]  Sam Tripple is here with Eddie Bravo, and Eddie, people want you to be more talkative.
[1:59:47.000 --> 1:59:51.000]  You're always busy in your smart phone, clicking and doing stuff.
[1:59:51.000 --> 1:59:53.000]  I got a business to run, dude.
[1:59:53.000 --> 1:59:56.000]  I know you got dojos all over the place.
[1:59:56.000 --> 1:59:57.000]  Yeah, yeah.
[1:59:57.000 --> 1:59:58.000]  We're doing it.
[1:59:58.000 --> 1:59:59.000]  Oh, shit, we're on.
[1:59:59.000 --> 2:00:01.000]  Oh, there he goes again.
[2:00:01.000 --> 2:00:02.000]  Come on, dude.
[2:00:02.000 --> 2:00:03.000]  Come on.
[2:00:03.000 --> 2:00:04.000]  This boy is ridiculous.
[2:00:04.000 --> 2:00:05.000]  It's like Tony Montana.
[2:00:05.000 --> 2:00:09.000]  That's why I'm being quiet, because I can't help it.
[2:00:09.000 --> 2:00:10.000]  No, you can't.
[2:00:10.000 --> 2:00:13.000]  I need a sign that says, don't cuss.
[2:00:13.000 --> 2:00:14.000]  Can I get that from this?
[2:00:14.000 --> 2:00:15.000]  No, no, no.
[2:00:15.000 --> 2:00:16.000]  You're doing great.
[2:00:16.000 --> 2:00:17.000]  Let's bring it out.
[2:00:17.000 --> 2:00:18.000]  Eddie, let's bring it out.
[2:00:18.000 --> 2:00:22.640]  I want to show you Mr. Cargill owns a gun shop here in Austin, and he gets footage almost
[2:00:22.640 --> 2:00:27.140]  every day of people defecating in front of his office or shooting up heroin, and this
[2:00:27.140 --> 2:00:29.640]  is right across the street, and this is all over Austin now.
[2:00:29.640 --> 2:00:31.240]  It wasn't here six months ago.
[2:00:31.240 --> 2:00:33.640]  It's exponentially increasing like day of the dead.
[2:00:33.640 --> 2:00:38.640]  When I drive to work a lot of mornings, I see things like this, and now the governor
[2:00:38.640 --> 2:00:43.640]  of California has passed laws that you don't have to aid citizens or the police.
[2:00:43.640 --> 2:00:47.640]  Failure to render aid is no longer a law in California, so you see some little kid run
[2:00:47.640 --> 2:00:48.640]  over.
[2:00:48.640 --> 2:00:49.640]  Well, no big deal if you don't help them.
[2:00:49.640 --> 2:00:53.140]  By the way, China has laws that you're not supposed to help people, literally.
[2:00:53.140 --> 2:00:55.640]  Let's go ahead and, yeah, let's play the audio of this.
[2:00:55.640 --> 2:00:56.640]  Oh my God.
[2:00:56.640 --> 2:00:57.640]  Oh my God.
[2:00:57.640 --> 2:00:58.640]  Yeah, this is it beginning.
[2:00:58.640 --> 2:01:03.640]  You know the worst part about fighting now?
[2:01:03.640 --> 2:01:06.640]  Nobody breaks up fights anymore.
[2:01:06.640 --> 2:01:07.640]  Look at the guy in the back.
[2:01:07.640 --> 2:01:09.640]  Look at like Black Uncle Sam back there.
[2:01:09.640 --> 2:01:10.640]  Like, just filming.
[2:01:10.640 --> 2:01:12.640]  Nobody stopped fights anymore.
[2:01:12.640 --> 2:01:15.640]  Well, it's like this kid got stabbed to death the other day, and everybody just...
[2:01:15.640 --> 2:01:17.640]  Oh my God, she's getting a weapon.
[2:01:17.640 --> 2:01:18.640]  She's got a whip.
[2:01:18.640 --> 2:01:19.640]  She's got a broom.
[2:01:19.640 --> 2:01:24.640]  And this guy is trying to get by on his bird with his Weekend at Bernie's T-shirt on,
[2:01:24.640 --> 2:01:26.640]  and now he got these two chicks fighting.
[2:01:26.640 --> 2:01:27.640]  And nobody stops anything.
[2:01:27.640 --> 2:01:28.640]  It's like Into the World Warfare.
[2:01:28.640 --> 2:01:29.640]  God.
[2:01:29.640 --> 2:01:31.640]  It's like show some love.
[2:01:31.640 --> 2:01:32.640]  Oh.
[2:01:32.640 --> 2:01:33.640]  Oh.
[2:01:33.640 --> 2:01:34.640]  Oh.
[2:01:34.640 --> 2:01:36.640]  Stop the fight, man.
[2:01:36.640 --> 2:01:38.640]  That's your friend.
[2:01:38.640 --> 2:01:40.640]  That's your friend.
[2:01:40.640 --> 2:01:41.640]  That's your friend.
[2:01:41.640 --> 2:01:42.640]  Stop the fight.
[2:01:42.640 --> 2:01:43.640]  That's your friend.
[2:01:43.640 --> 2:01:44.640]  Nah, man.
[2:01:44.640 --> 2:01:45.640]  She's trying to stop.
[2:01:45.640 --> 2:01:46.640]  The guy in the wheelchair over there just chilling.
[2:01:46.640 --> 2:01:48.640]  We got like a...
[2:01:48.640 --> 2:01:50.640]  We got Vince Carter's there not doing anything.
[2:01:50.640 --> 2:01:52.640]  Well, that's his girl.
[2:01:52.640 --> 2:01:53.640]  Come on, man.
[2:01:53.640 --> 2:01:54.640]  Oh.
[2:01:54.640 --> 2:01:55.640]  Now listen, they're gonna help their lady now.
[2:01:55.640 --> 2:01:56.640]  That guy's a major pimp.
[2:01:56.640 --> 2:01:57.640]  Look.
[2:01:57.640 --> 2:01:59.640]  God, he's not a pimp.
[2:01:59.640 --> 2:02:01.640]  He's just a Dallas Maverick fan.
[2:02:01.640 --> 2:02:02.640]  But it's like...
[2:02:02.640 --> 2:02:03.640]  No, no, they live out there.
[2:02:03.640 --> 2:02:04.640]  She's rocking the toe.
[2:02:04.640 --> 2:02:05.640]  It's just ridiculous, dude.
[2:02:05.640 --> 2:02:06.640]  It's just ridiculous.
[2:02:06.640 --> 2:02:08.640]  That is almost at every underpass now.
[2:02:08.640 --> 2:02:11.640]  But last time I was in L.A., it was even worse than that.
[2:02:11.640 --> 2:02:12.640]  Everywhere you just see them.
[2:02:12.640 --> 2:02:13.640]  Yeah.
[2:02:13.640 --> 2:02:14.640]  They ship them in, Alex.
[2:02:14.640 --> 2:02:16.640]  They set up shop like along the freeways now.
[2:02:16.640 --> 2:02:18.640]  Like it's like in our third world country.
[2:02:18.640 --> 2:02:22.640]  It's like you're driving down the 101 and they got little spots on the side of the freeway.
[2:02:22.640 --> 2:02:25.640]  But then they get government welfare and then they spend it on drugs.
[2:02:25.640 --> 2:02:27.640]  And the police are ordered, don't bust them for drugs.
[2:02:27.640 --> 2:02:28.640]  I've talked to the cops.
[2:02:28.640 --> 2:02:30.640]  The police gave us a turn.
[2:02:30.640 --> 2:02:32.640]  What do you think the plan is?
[2:02:32.640 --> 2:02:33.640]  They're doing this why?
[2:02:33.640 --> 2:02:34.640]  There's gotta be a plan, right?
[2:02:34.640 --> 2:02:35.640]  That's why I was gonna ask you.
[2:02:35.640 --> 2:02:36.640]  What's the plan?
[2:02:36.640 --> 2:02:41.640]  I mean, anything to destroy...
[2:02:41.640 --> 2:02:43.640]  I think it's society, right?
[2:02:43.640 --> 2:02:44.640]  They're just trying to...
[2:02:44.640 --> 2:02:47.640]  They're trying to just ruin the country, right?
[2:02:47.640 --> 2:02:48.640]  Isn't that the plan?
[2:02:48.640 --> 2:02:51.640]  And notice the media always shows, put that photo back up.
[2:02:51.640 --> 2:02:54.640]  Like one out of a thousand halfway decent looking.
[2:02:54.640 --> 2:02:55.640]  But that's not a homeless person.
[2:02:55.640 --> 2:02:59.640]  That's an activist that probably runs some activist homeless shelter
[2:02:59.640 --> 2:03:01.640]  and makes money off the top of it.
[2:03:01.640 --> 2:03:02.640]  Because that's what I'm told.
[2:03:02.640 --> 2:03:06.640]  It's always the leftist that are scooping in the cold hard cash.
[2:03:06.640 --> 2:03:08.640]  Here's my opinion, Alex.
[2:03:08.640 --> 2:03:11.640]  This whole thing with free trade, it's all done on purpose.
[2:03:11.640 --> 2:03:13.640]  Ship out the jobs to China.
[2:03:13.640 --> 2:03:15.640]  There's no jobs around.
[2:03:15.640 --> 2:03:17.640]  Flood the market with drugs.
[2:03:17.640 --> 2:03:19.640]  So now you got two choices in your life.
[2:03:19.640 --> 2:03:22.640]  Either like go to jail or join the military
[2:03:22.640 --> 2:03:25.640]  and become stormtroopers for the international bankers.
[2:03:25.640 --> 2:03:27.640]  And that's not code for Jews.
[2:03:27.640 --> 2:03:30.640]  That's code for international bankers, okay?
[2:03:30.640 --> 2:03:31.640]  And that's what we're doing.
[2:03:31.640 --> 2:03:35.640]  We send their sons and daughters to die for corporate interest.
[2:03:35.640 --> 2:03:36.640]  Why are we in Afghanistan?
[2:03:36.640 --> 2:03:38.640]  Oh yeah, poppy fields.
[2:03:38.640 --> 2:03:39.640]  It's the same thing, man.
[2:03:39.640 --> 2:03:40.640]  That's what it is.
[2:03:40.640 --> 2:03:42.640]  They want it so you don't have any other...
[2:03:42.640 --> 2:03:43.640]  By the way, that's a still shot you just saw.
[2:03:43.640 --> 2:03:45.640]  A real video we shot in Skid Row.
[2:03:45.640 --> 2:03:47.640]  The left brings them a lavish furniture and money.
[2:03:47.640 --> 2:03:49.640]  And it goes, oh.
[2:03:49.640 --> 2:03:52.640]  So more and more people just go out there and lay out.
[2:03:52.640 --> 2:03:54.640]  I mean, it's the real world.
[2:03:54.640 --> 2:03:56.640]  That's real footage, man.
[2:03:56.640 --> 2:03:58.640]  That's out of our car.
[2:03:58.640 --> 2:04:00.640]  A drive-by.
[2:04:00.640 --> 2:04:01.640]  There you go.
[2:04:01.640 --> 2:04:03.640]  It's road warrior for real.
[2:04:03.640 --> 2:04:04.640]  We'll be back.
[2:04:04.640 --> 2:04:05.640]  We have a special guest.
[2:04:05.640 --> 2:04:06.640]  I haven't told you about that yet.
[2:04:06.640 --> 2:04:09.640]  It's the day of the weather.
[2:04:09.640 --> 2:04:12.640]  There is no doubt that President Trump is a God sent.
[2:04:12.640 --> 2:04:14.640]  We're blessed to have him.
[2:04:14.640 --> 2:04:16.640]  The list of great things he's doing is simply amazing.
[2:04:16.640 --> 2:04:20.640]  And you know the establishment is upset by him going after him.
[2:04:20.640 --> 2:04:23.640]  That's another sign that we should support the president.
[2:04:23.640 --> 2:04:27.640]  But the fact that they said that you cannot say my name in a positive way,
[2:04:27.640 --> 2:04:29.640]  or my website on Facebook,
[2:04:29.640 --> 2:04:31.640]  four months ago and Trump did nothing.
[2:04:31.640 --> 2:04:34.640]  Well, now they're saying you can't promote the MRA
[2:04:34.640 --> 2:04:36.640]  or show women at a shooting range.
[2:04:36.640 --> 2:04:38.640]  They're calling it criminal or terrorist activity.
[2:04:38.640 --> 2:04:40.640]  The articles on infowars.com,
[2:04:40.640 --> 2:04:44.640]  direct statements and screenshots and documents from Facebook.
[2:04:44.640 --> 2:04:47.640]  And this allows all their digital computer systems
[2:04:47.640 --> 2:04:49.640]  and all the other AI systems, not just Facebook,
[2:04:49.640 --> 2:04:51.640]  in the future, which is already here,
[2:04:51.640 --> 2:04:53.640]  to go in and control everything you say and do
[2:04:53.640 --> 2:04:56.640]  from text messages to statements you make to things you write.
[2:04:56.640 --> 2:04:58.640]  And our children in public schools and everything else
[2:04:58.640 --> 2:04:59.640]  are being monitored by it.
[2:04:59.640 --> 2:05:01.640]  We're being monitored by it in our homes.
[2:05:01.640 --> 2:05:04.640]  And this is the total takeover of civilization and society.
[2:05:04.640 --> 2:05:06.640]  And we must warn the people,
[2:05:06.640 --> 2:05:09.640]  we must become aware of this revolution against humanity.
[2:05:36.640 --> 2:05:42.640]  Well, you heard it here first, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:05:42.640 --> 2:05:45.640]  We don't talk a lot about Camilla Harris
[2:05:45.640 --> 2:05:48.640]  because she's never polled over 1%.
[2:05:48.640 --> 2:05:51.640]  But like Beto O'Rourke, she's our savior.
[2:05:51.640 --> 2:05:54.640]  And so the media said she would be the nominee
[2:05:54.640 --> 2:05:56.640]  over and over and over again.
[2:05:56.640 --> 2:05:59.640]  Well, now CNN ran the headline last night.
[2:05:59.640 --> 2:06:02.640]  Report whatever happened to Kamala,
[2:06:02.640 --> 2:06:04.640]  I call her Camilla,
[2:06:04.640 --> 2:06:06.640]  Harris, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:06:06.640 --> 2:06:09.640]  I mean, this woman is absolutely incredible.
[2:06:09.640 --> 2:06:11.640]  And she was drunk in the last debate.
[2:06:11.640 --> 2:06:13.640]  She's incredibly boring.
[2:06:13.640 --> 2:06:15.640]  But it's not a question of what happened to Kamala Harris.
[2:06:15.640 --> 2:06:20.640]  Why does the corporate media decide somebody like Beto O'Rourke
[2:06:20.640 --> 2:06:25.640]  or somebody like Kamala Harris is the heir apparent
[2:06:25.640 --> 2:06:27.640]  and that she's absolutely invincible
[2:06:27.640 --> 2:06:29.640]  and that she's absolutely wonderful.
[2:06:29.640 --> 2:06:31.640]  And then they asked what happened to her.
[2:06:31.640 --> 2:06:35.640]  Their endorsement of her is what destroyed her.
[2:06:35.640 --> 2:06:38.640]  Whenever Rand Paul ended up winning the Senate years ago,
[2:06:38.640 --> 2:06:40.640]  they politically called him and said, how did he do it?
[2:06:40.640 --> 2:06:42.640]  And I said, because you didn't endorse him.
[2:06:42.640 --> 2:06:44.640]  I said, if you endorsed him, you would have lost.
[2:06:44.640 --> 2:06:46.640]  And they didn't even understand that.
[2:06:46.640 --> 2:06:49.640]  I mean, literally the corporate system is out of gas.
[2:06:49.640 --> 2:06:50.640]  People are sick of them.
[2:06:50.640 --> 2:06:52.640]  Both of you here are famous comics here with us,
[2:06:52.640 --> 2:06:56.640]  famous Jiu-Jitsu master here with us from 10th Planet Jiu-Jitsu.
[2:06:56.640 --> 2:06:59.640]  Eddie Bravo and of course, we have Sam Tripoli here.
[2:06:59.640 --> 2:07:01.640]  What is your take?
[2:07:01.640 --> 2:07:03.640]  Not on Kamala Harris, but just in general,
[2:07:03.640 --> 2:07:06.640]  the media asking why their hype isn't working anymore.
[2:07:06.640 --> 2:07:11.640]  And since it's not working, what are they going to do next?
[2:07:11.640 --> 2:07:14.640]  Basically, I believe that Kamala Harris's problem
[2:07:14.640 --> 2:07:17.640]  is that her history is there undoing.
[2:07:17.640 --> 2:07:19.640]  She's locked up more black people
[2:07:19.640 --> 2:07:21.640]  than anybody in the history of California.
[2:07:21.640 --> 2:07:23.640]  Her ancestors were slave traders.
[2:07:23.640 --> 2:07:27.640]  You can't really blame somebody for what their ancestors do
[2:07:27.640 --> 2:07:32.640]  until you realize that she had her office argue against early release.
[2:07:32.640 --> 2:07:36.640]  Prisoners who had good behavior, you know?
[2:07:36.640 --> 2:07:39.640]  So basically, you know why she argued that?
[2:07:39.640 --> 2:07:41.640]  It's because it would ruin the labor force.
[2:07:41.640 --> 2:07:43.640]  Oh, what are we talking about?
[2:07:43.640 --> 2:07:46.640]  Oh, we're talking about free slave labor.
[2:07:46.640 --> 2:07:51.640]  So you're committing the pattern of your ancestors here, okay?
[2:07:51.640 --> 2:07:56.640]  She laughed about locking up kids, poor kids for being late to school.
[2:07:56.640 --> 2:07:58.640]  I mean, like, dude, you're a scumbag.
[2:07:58.640 --> 2:08:00.640]  Listen, I love every group out there.
[2:08:00.640 --> 2:08:04.640]  The only group I hate, 100%, is male feminists.
[2:08:04.640 --> 2:08:08.640]  Why? Because I don't like people who screw their own.
[2:08:08.640 --> 2:08:10.640]  Kamala Harris was screwing the black community,
[2:08:10.640 --> 2:08:13.640]  and they know it, and they won't get behind her
[2:08:13.640 --> 2:08:15.640]  because of what she did to her own.
[2:08:15.640 --> 2:08:17.640]  That's why she got no love.
[2:08:17.640 --> 2:08:19.640]  That's why Hillary Clinton got no love
[2:08:19.640 --> 2:08:21.640]  from the black community when she ran,
[2:08:21.640 --> 2:08:23.640]  because her super predators.
[2:08:23.640 --> 2:08:25.640]  That was the word we were trying to remember yesterday.
[2:08:25.640 --> 2:08:26.640]  Super predator.
[2:08:26.640 --> 2:08:29.640]  They called black men in the hood super predators,
[2:08:29.640 --> 2:08:32.640]  and they locked them up because a nugget of crack
[2:08:32.640 --> 2:08:34.640]  was worth a helicopter of cocaine,
[2:08:34.640 --> 2:08:36.640]  and they knew about helicopters of cocaine
[2:08:36.640 --> 2:08:38.640]  because they were flying them into Arkansas
[2:08:38.640 --> 2:08:41.640]  to sell in the hood during the Iran-Contra affair.
[2:08:41.640 --> 2:08:43.640]  That's why Kamala Harris got no love
[2:08:43.640 --> 2:08:46.640]  because she's a scumbag and a backstabber.
[2:08:46.640 --> 2:08:47.640]  That's why.
[2:08:47.640 --> 2:08:49.640]  I totally agree, but the bigger question is,
[2:08:49.640 --> 2:08:52.640]  why does the media keep betting on creeperzoids
[2:08:52.640 --> 2:08:54.640]  like Beto O'Rourke? I mean, seriously,
[2:08:54.640 --> 2:08:56.640]  I looked at him the first time, and I said,
[2:08:56.640 --> 2:08:58.640]  he looks like a mentally ill serial killer,
[2:08:58.640 --> 2:09:00.640]  the most disingenuous person.
[2:09:00.640 --> 2:09:03.640]  Then he does everything disingenuous,
[2:09:03.640 --> 2:09:05.640]  and in a clip last night, he said,
[2:09:05.640 --> 2:09:07.640]  I never said I'm coming for your guns.
[2:09:07.640 --> 2:09:10.640]  I already played it first hour, but we are going to take them.
[2:09:10.640 --> 2:09:13.640]  They don't even say it from interview to interview change, 180.
[2:09:13.640 --> 2:09:15.640]  They flip flop in front of you, Eddie.
[2:09:15.640 --> 2:09:17.640]  What is that? It's a form of gaslighting.
[2:09:17.640 --> 2:09:19.640]  It seems like he's trying to lose.
[2:09:19.640 --> 2:09:20.640]  Yeah.
[2:09:20.640 --> 2:09:24.640]  It's like maybe, aren't there rumors that maybe
[2:09:24.640 --> 2:09:28.640]  either Michelle Obama or Hillary Clinton's going to run?
[2:09:28.640 --> 2:09:30.640]  Step in for the last second.
[2:09:30.640 --> 2:09:32.640]  They're not rumors.
[2:09:32.640 --> 2:09:34.640]  I have people that are in her security details.
[2:09:34.640 --> 2:09:36.640]  She still thinks she's running the Democratic Party.
[2:09:36.640 --> 2:09:39.640]  I'm glad you brought that up because that was your telepathic.
[2:09:39.640 --> 2:09:41.640]  They said Hillary still runs the Democratic Party,
[2:09:41.640 --> 2:09:43.640]  and she still gives the orders.
[2:09:43.640 --> 2:09:46.640]  I know she's got people suing me, and they worship her,
[2:09:46.640 --> 2:09:49.640]  and the word is she thinks she's going to flap in
[2:09:49.640 --> 2:09:52.640]  at the last moment and run.
[2:09:52.640 --> 2:09:55.640]  And now it's mainstream news, Hillary hanging around,
[2:09:55.640 --> 2:09:58.640]  Bookie taking more bets that she's going to be the nominee.
[2:09:58.640 --> 2:10:00.640]  What do you think?
[2:10:00.640 --> 2:10:02.640]  She'll take it now again.
[2:10:02.640 --> 2:10:06.640]  Isn't, I mean, what do you think about the Clinton body count?
[2:10:06.640 --> 2:10:07.640]  Is that real?
[2:10:07.640 --> 2:10:08.640]  Of course.
[2:10:08.640 --> 2:10:09.640]  It's real.
[2:10:09.640 --> 2:10:10.640]  And then Google censors it.
[2:10:10.640 --> 2:10:12.640]  And then how do you...
[2:10:12.640 --> 2:10:14.640]  I mean, Jeff, you have Steve's neck was broken twice.
[2:10:14.640 --> 2:10:17.640]  How many bodies are on the Clinton body count?
[2:10:17.640 --> 2:10:19.640]  Depending on the list, the list is in...
[2:10:19.640 --> 2:10:20.640]  At least what?
[2:10:20.640 --> 2:10:22.640]  Well, if you count all the wars, it's in the millions.
[2:10:22.640 --> 2:10:23.640]  Yeah.
[2:10:23.640 --> 2:10:26.640]  500,000 dead Iraqi children that they specifically cut the medicine to,
[2:10:26.640 --> 2:10:28.640]  crippled the sanctions, the bushes, and they said,
[2:10:28.640 --> 2:10:30.640]  we kill 500,000 kids, we do it again.
[2:10:30.640 --> 2:10:31.640]  Madeline Albright on 60 Minutes.
[2:10:31.640 --> 2:10:33.640]  I'm talking about the...
[2:10:33.640 --> 2:10:35.640]  The conservative numbers are in the 400s.
[2:10:35.640 --> 2:10:38.640]  Most lists are in the hundreds.
[2:10:38.640 --> 2:10:39.640]  Hundreds.
[2:10:39.640 --> 2:10:40.640]  Isn't it?
[2:10:40.640 --> 2:10:41.640]  I thought it was like 55 or 60.
[2:10:41.640 --> 2:10:42.640]  Well, no.
[2:10:42.640 --> 2:10:44.640]  Those are lists that people get real neurotic about,
[2:10:44.640 --> 2:10:47.640]  just like, you know, like Vince Foster.
[2:10:47.640 --> 2:10:48.640]  Yeah.
[2:10:48.640 --> 2:10:50.640]  Or, you know, the kids found out on the railroad tracks,
[2:10:50.640 --> 2:10:53.640]  all shot up, saw the Mina drug dealing,
[2:10:53.640 --> 2:10:55.640]  or girlfriends of Clinton and ended up dead.
[2:10:55.640 --> 2:10:56.640]  Yeah.
[2:10:56.640 --> 2:10:58.640]  So those are like, like, legit connections, right?
[2:10:58.640 --> 2:10:59.640]  Like the 50s and 60s.
[2:10:59.640 --> 2:11:03.640]  I mean, I've interviewed women right by Bill Clinton and stuff,
[2:11:03.640 --> 2:11:05.640]  and people come to their houses and go,
[2:11:05.640 --> 2:11:06.640]  sorry, your little dog's missing.
[2:11:06.640 --> 2:11:07.640]  I'm going to kill you next.
[2:11:07.640 --> 2:11:08.640]  You don't shut up.
[2:11:08.640 --> 2:11:11.640]  I mean, I've had death threats from the Clintons.
[2:11:11.640 --> 2:11:12.640]  Unbelievable.
[2:11:12.640 --> 2:11:13.640]  Really?
[2:11:13.640 --> 2:11:15.640]  Well, I mean, I don't want to get into it,
[2:11:15.640 --> 2:11:17.640]  and it's part of the issue of, you know,
[2:11:17.640 --> 2:11:19.640]  having to have security here and at my house.
[2:11:19.640 --> 2:11:22.640]  But, I mean, it's real.
[2:11:22.640 --> 2:11:24.640]  They've got a lot of mental patients, too.
[2:11:24.640 --> 2:11:25.640]  They can tell to go kill people.
[2:11:25.640 --> 2:11:28.640]  It is unbelievable to me that a person whose organization
[2:11:28.640 --> 2:11:33.640]  has been directly connected to four, four, four
[2:11:33.640 --> 2:11:38.640]  major child sex trafficking cases in one year, 2019.
[2:11:38.640 --> 2:11:40.640]  And we're not even going to get to the end of the year.
[2:11:40.640 --> 2:11:41.640]  Lay it on him, Sam.
[2:11:41.640 --> 2:11:42.640]  Not even the end of the year.
[2:11:42.640 --> 2:11:43.640]  It's 2019.
[2:11:43.640 --> 2:11:44.640]  Lay him out.
[2:11:44.640 --> 2:11:49.640]  We have El Chapo that they framed as a drug thing,
[2:11:49.640 --> 2:11:52.640]  but he was convicted of child sex trafficking,
[2:11:52.640 --> 2:11:56.640]  and he was a major donor to the Clint global initiative.
[2:11:56.640 --> 2:11:57.640]  He worked directly for the CIA.
[2:11:57.640 --> 2:11:58.640]  Yeah.
[2:11:58.640 --> 2:12:02.640]  I know people like, there was a CIA that worked directly
[2:12:02.640 --> 2:12:05.640]  with him, like Josh Plumlee.
[2:12:05.640 --> 2:12:07.640]  Yeah, he was a district manager.
[2:12:07.640 --> 2:12:08.640]  That's what he was.
[2:12:08.640 --> 2:12:10.640]  He was like the district manager at McDonald's.
[2:12:10.640 --> 2:12:12.640]  Yeah, of the drug trade in Mexico.
[2:12:12.640 --> 2:12:16.640]  And then you have Jeffrey Epstein, who died.
[2:12:16.640 --> 2:12:19.640]  And then we have Nexium, straight out of upstate New York,
[2:12:19.640 --> 2:12:22.640]  Hala, 607, straight out in upstate New York,
[2:12:22.640 --> 2:12:25.640]  convicted child sex trafficking.
[2:12:25.640 --> 2:12:28.640]  They thought evidence from the Anthony Weiner laptop.
[2:12:28.640 --> 2:12:32.640]  And then now we have John of God directly related to the
[2:12:32.640 --> 2:12:33.640]  Clint global initiative.
[2:12:33.640 --> 2:12:35.640]  You have four cases.
[2:12:35.640 --> 2:12:36.640]  How can you do that?
[2:12:36.640 --> 2:12:37.640]  Well, let's go further.
[2:12:37.640 --> 2:12:39.640]  The head of their whole Haiti operation got a conviction
[2:12:39.640 --> 2:12:41.640]  ship and hundreds of kids out of bunching it up dead.
[2:12:41.640 --> 2:12:45.640]  She then changed her name and still runs child charities.
[2:12:45.640 --> 2:12:46.640]  Yeah.
[2:12:46.640 --> 2:12:47.640]  No, explain that.
[2:12:47.640 --> 2:12:48.640]  Laura Silver.
[2:12:48.640 --> 2:12:49.640]  Laura Silver.
[2:12:49.640 --> 2:12:50.640]  What happened?
[2:12:50.640 --> 2:12:51.640]  She smuggled kids?
[2:12:51.640 --> 2:12:53.640]  Well, the UN's own AP report.
[2:12:53.640 --> 2:12:55.640]  Remember, we sent people in.
[2:12:55.640 --> 2:12:57.640]  We sent a whole bunch of folks went in.
[2:12:57.640 --> 2:12:58.640]  Joe Biggs went in.
[2:12:58.640 --> 2:12:59.640]  Where?
[2:12:59.640 --> 2:13:00.640]  In Haiti?
[2:13:00.640 --> 2:13:01.640]  Michael Zimmerman went in.
[2:13:01.640 --> 2:13:02.640]  Yeah, let me tell you.
[2:13:02.640 --> 2:13:03.640]  Before this all broke.
[2:13:03.640 --> 2:13:05.640]  And we sent in, with his own private plane,
[2:13:05.640 --> 2:13:07.640]  Gary Haven, billionaire.
[2:13:07.640 --> 2:13:09.640]  And they spent weeks there.
[2:13:09.640 --> 2:13:11.640]  But he'd been there months landing on dirt airstrips.
[2:13:11.640 --> 2:13:13.640]  And they were there and exposed the whole UN child
[2:13:13.640 --> 2:13:14.640]  kidnapping ring.
[2:13:14.640 --> 2:13:17.640]  They made AP break it six months later and admit the
[2:13:17.640 --> 2:13:18.640]  whole thing.
[2:13:18.640 --> 2:13:20.640]  Thousands of missing kids, hundreds found dead,
[2:13:20.640 --> 2:13:23.640]  killed in child sacrifices.
[2:13:23.640 --> 2:13:26.640]  I mean, people have gone to investigate that and ended up
[2:13:26.640 --> 2:13:27.640]  dead, man.
[2:13:27.640 --> 2:13:28.640]  I mean, these are cases.
[2:13:28.640 --> 2:13:32.640]  These are straight up either dead, people dead.
[2:13:32.640 --> 2:13:33.640]  Listen, we interviewed.
[2:13:33.640 --> 2:13:38.640]  We interviewed senators, Haitian senators.
[2:13:38.640 --> 2:13:39.640]  They're on the video.
[2:13:39.640 --> 2:13:40.640]  We got back going.
[2:13:40.640 --> 2:13:41.640]  They are devil worshipers.
[2:13:41.640 --> 2:13:42.640]  They take them.
[2:13:42.640 --> 2:13:43.640]  They kill them.
[2:13:43.640 --> 2:13:44.640]  Help us.
[2:13:44.640 --> 2:13:45.640]  Hillary killed the babies.
[2:13:45.640 --> 2:13:46.640]  Stop devil Hillary.
[2:13:46.640 --> 2:13:48.640]  Dude, you are a man of a thousand voices.
[2:13:48.640 --> 2:13:49.640]  And I love it, dude.
[2:13:49.640 --> 2:13:51.640]  You should have your own show in Vegas.
[2:13:51.640 --> 2:13:52.640]  It's amazing.
[2:13:52.640 --> 2:13:53.640]  And it's true.
[2:13:53.640 --> 2:13:54.640]  You know, I did.
[2:13:54.640 --> 2:13:56.640]  I made millions on voiceovers.
[2:13:56.640 --> 2:13:58.640]  And as Bill Hicks.
[2:13:58.640 --> 2:14:01.640]  And I invested in this broadcast.
[2:14:01.640 --> 2:14:04.640]  In fact, voiceover money helped us move to this location 14
[2:14:04.640 --> 2:14:05.640]  years ago.
[2:14:05.640 --> 2:14:06.640]  That's amazing, dude.
[2:14:06.640 --> 2:14:09.640]  Well, I got tapped partly into the spring screen actress.
[2:14:09.640 --> 2:14:10.640]  That was in some movies.
[2:14:10.640 --> 2:14:12.640]  And then I ended up doing some ads for insurance companies.
[2:14:12.640 --> 2:14:13.640]  Do you have any clips of that?
[2:14:13.640 --> 2:14:14.640]  I want to hear that.
[2:14:14.640 --> 2:14:15.640]  I can take it out here somewhere.
[2:14:15.640 --> 2:14:16.640]  Yeah, do it, dude.
[2:14:16.640 --> 2:14:17.640]  But I'm blackballed now.
[2:14:17.640 --> 2:14:19.640]  I mean, once I went after Obama.
[2:14:19.640 --> 2:14:21.640]  Like a good partner.
[2:14:21.640 --> 2:14:22.640]  State Farm is there.
[2:14:22.640 --> 2:14:23.640]  That was out.
[2:14:23.640 --> 2:14:24.640]  Was that one of yours?
[2:14:24.640 --> 2:14:25.640]  I can do like that.
[2:14:25.640 --> 2:14:26.640]  Let's hear it.
[2:14:26.640 --> 2:14:27.640]  They're killing babies.
[2:14:27.640 --> 2:14:29.640]  Well, this particular, you know, the voice of,
[2:14:29.640 --> 2:14:32.640]  they call the voice of God from the HBO NFL show.
[2:14:32.640 --> 2:14:33.640]  Yeah.
[2:14:33.640 --> 2:14:34.640]  Well, I'm a mimic.
[2:14:34.640 --> 2:14:36.640]  So I have to hear it, but I have a deep enough voice.
[2:14:36.640 --> 2:14:37.640]  Yeah.
[2:14:37.640 --> 2:14:38.640]  I have to hear it.
[2:14:38.640 --> 2:14:40.640]  And then I can nail it almost, almost exactly.
[2:14:40.640 --> 2:14:43.640]  But I can also do like Optimus Prime,
[2:14:43.640 --> 2:14:44.640]  Marvin the March.
[2:14:44.640 --> 2:14:45.640]  Let's hear some voices.
[2:14:45.640 --> 2:14:46.640]  Let's hear it.
[2:14:46.640 --> 2:14:47.640]  Come on, man.
[2:14:47.640 --> 2:14:48.640]  Just give me a couple.
[2:14:48.640 --> 2:14:49.640]  We got a big guest coming up.
[2:14:49.640 --> 2:14:53.640]  Let me auto bots transform and roll out.
[2:14:53.640 --> 2:14:54.640]  There we go.
[2:14:54.640 --> 2:14:55.640]  We came to your planet.
[2:14:55.640 --> 2:14:57.640]  That's more go bots, but that's okay.
[2:14:57.640 --> 2:14:59.640]  We came to your planet from Cybertron.
[2:14:59.640 --> 2:15:00.640]  Yeah.
[2:15:00.640 --> 2:15:01.640]  Megatron is my enemy.
[2:15:01.640 --> 2:15:03.640]  I am sworn to destroy him.
[2:15:03.640 --> 2:15:04.640]  Stay with us.
[2:15:04.640 --> 2:15:07.640]  Alex Jones will resist Megatron on the other side.
[2:15:07.640 --> 2:15:08.640]  That's it.
[2:15:08.640 --> 2:15:11.640]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners.
[2:15:11.640 --> 2:15:14.640]  If you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup system,
[2:15:14.640 --> 2:15:17.640]  but we're waiting for prices too crazy to pass up,
[2:15:17.640 --> 2:15:20.640]  this will be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[2:15:20.640 --> 2:15:21.640]  Bill Hyde here.
[2:15:21.640 --> 2:15:23.640]  I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices
[2:15:23.640 --> 2:15:25.640]  on our PPX microgrid system.
[2:15:25.640 --> 2:15:28.640]  That's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity
[2:15:28.640 --> 2:15:29.640]  off the grid.
[2:15:29.640 --> 2:15:32.640]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here
[2:15:32.640 --> 2:15:34.640]  right on the east bank of the Mississippi.
[2:15:34.640 --> 2:15:37.640]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory
[2:15:37.640 --> 2:15:40.640]  to a temporary location, and rather than move it back to the warehouse,
[2:15:40.640 --> 2:15:44.640]  we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable
[2:15:44.640 --> 2:15:46.640]  if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory.
[2:15:46.640 --> 2:15:48.640]  So here's what you should do right now.
[2:15:48.640 --> 2:15:52.640]  Check out the PPX microgrid system at myownpowergrid.com.
[2:15:52.640 --> 2:15:54.640]  That's myownpowergrid.com.

[2:15:58.640 --> 2:15:59.640]  And the best part?
[2:15:59.640 --> 2:16:03.640]  You're not going to pay $750 or $500, $300 or even $200.
[2:16:03.640 --> 2:16:05.640]  Go to myownpowergrid.com to learn more.

[2:16:08.640 --> 2:16:09.640]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[2:16:09.640 --> 2:16:11.640]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago
[2:16:11.640 --> 2:16:13.640]  when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[2:16:13.640 --> 2:16:14.640]  I sued the IRS in one.
[2:16:14.640 --> 2:16:17.640]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[2:16:17.640 --> 2:16:19.640]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement,
[2:16:19.640 --> 2:16:21.640]  and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems
[2:16:21.640 --> 2:16:23.640]  they thought might never be solved.
[2:16:23.640 --> 2:16:24.640]  I can help you too.
[2:16:24.640 --> 2:16:27.640]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[2:16:27.640 --> 2:16:29.640]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.

[2:20:50.320 --> 2:20:53.840]  lot of them are convicted pedophiles they're actually saying in places like

[2:21:15.840 --> 2:21:20.120]  which ones they start shooting them I know a lot of trans people mostly because
[2:21:20.120 --> 2:21:26.320]  that a bad drug problem went on some weird adult film runs okay and I just
[2:21:26.320 --> 2:21:30.280]  want to say that most trans I know don't like drag Queens going and meeting
[2:21:30.280 --> 2:21:34.480]  with kids either they don't like that they don't think that's cool and that's
[2:21:34.480 --> 2:21:39.240]  just a psi op done by the CIA to get us all mad at the trans community so we
[2:21:39.240 --> 2:21:42.240]  all fight with each other that's what that's all about and I just gotta say
[2:21:42.240 --> 2:21:47.880]  shout out to these but the I it's all a gist a giant it's just like the hippie
[2:21:47.880 --> 2:21:53.120]  culture of the 60s and 70s with the Mansons in the Jonestown to get us the
[2:21:53.120 --> 2:21:57.800]  hate liberals most your trans don't like that either there's a deal they're
[2:21:57.800 --> 2:22:00.640]  good whoever the hell these people aren't clown out fit sit the hell away
[2:22:00.640 --> 2:22:06.480]  from the kids yeah I'm with you I'm with you it's all psi off dog shut us we

[2:22:45.960 --> 2:22:49.000]  this against me but it's okay because we're having a debate flat earths a huge
[2:22:49.000 --> 2:22:53.200]  discussion I think the bigger issue is people know the systems lie to them so
[2:22:53.200 --> 2:22:59.600]  much about so many things that now a lot of people I know people aren't even
[2:22:59.600 --> 2:23:01.880]  listeners are like you know I don't appreciate you on the liberal but I

[2:26:19.120 --> 2:26:24.320]  to actual photos of stars and galaxies captured by NASA's powerful telescope
[2:26:24.320 --> 2:26:29.400]  for it's a delicate blend of imagination and data the artists meet with NASA
[2:26:29.400 --> 2:26:34.800]  scientists over many drafts to ensure a planet or galaxies look lines up with
[2:26:34.800 --> 2:26:39.800]  the research to make ink final results enough to keep us all dreaming of the
[2:26:39.800 --> 2:26:46.760]  final frontier for years to come Chris Martinez CBS over the years NASA has
[2:26:46.760 --> 2:26:51.200]  given us a fabulous rendering let me just say something right here number one
[2:26:51.200 --> 2:26:54.960]  that was the worst editing and jump cuts I've ever seen number two they're
[2:26:54.960 --> 2:26:58.920]  talking about when they say illustrations or renderings are enhancements
[2:26:58.920 --> 2:27:03.320]  they say that in the magazines they say it online they do say it that this is
[2:27:03.320 --> 2:27:08.240]  what we believe this exoplanet or whatever exactly they do that to
[2:27:08.240 --> 2:27:11.920]  everything we're gonna go to our special guest 11 I apologize for you
[2:27:11.920 --> 2:27:15.200]  for you being a man bad person I'm joking let's be serious for as we go to
[2:27:15.200 --> 2:27:19.960]  break you understand that I took astronomy in college which I'm not saying
[2:27:19.960 --> 2:27:26.400]  I bought into that I went and convinced my dad I was like 19 to buy now they're
[2:27:26.400 --> 2:27:30.520]  a lot cheaper a mead 12 inch it was reflector refractor one of the big
[2:27:30.520 --> 2:27:36.000]  entry ones it was like $14,000 did you flat earth listen listen I would drive
[2:27:36.000 --> 2:27:40.080]  out in the desert and set up all night and drink a six pack of beer with my dad
[2:27:40.080 --> 2:27:45.000]  and I would watch Jupiter rotate and look at its moons I took color photos of
[2:27:45.000 --> 2:27:48.400]  myself with a device let me see it you know most sure you know most these
[2:27:48.400 --> 2:27:51.240]  well it's it's it's at home but you know most these comments and all these
[2:27:51.240 --> 2:27:55.720]  things get found by civilians with telescopes I'm not saying that what
[2:27:55.720 --> 2:27:59.320]  you're looking up in the skies and there it's there but what they're telling us
[2:27:59.320 --> 2:28:08.800]  it is is not real I'm seeing that Sam Tripoli likes to force look at that folks
[2:28:08.800 --> 2:28:14.320]  attention GCN self-reliance listeners if you've ever wanted an emergency solar
[2:28:14.320 --> 2:28:17.920]  survival backup system but we're waiting for prices too crazy to pass up
[2:28:17.920 --> 2:28:21.640]  this will be the most important message you'll ever hear Bill Hyde here I want
[2:28:21.640 --> 2:28:25.300]  to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on our PPX
[2:28:25.300 --> 2:28:29.160]  microgrid system that's gonna let you produce an endless supply of electricity
[2:28:29.160 --> 2:28:32.880]  off the grid the clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're
[2:28:32.880 --> 2:28:36.280]  having here right on the East Bank of the Mississippi because of the flooding
[2:28:36.280 --> 2:28:40.200]  we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location and rather than
[2:28:40.200 --> 2:28:43.480]  move it back to the warehouse we thought we'd offer the system at a price that
[2:28:43.480 --> 2:28:47.840]  might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the flood waters backstory so here's
[2:28:47.840 --> 2:28:51.720]  what you should do right now check out the PPX microgrid system at my own
[2:28:51.720 --> 2:28:56.640]  power grid dot com that's my own power grid dot com over a thousand dollars in
[2:28:56.640 --> 2:29:00.200]  great off the grid gear and a ton of bonuses too in the best part you're
[2:29:00.200 --> 2:29:05.960]  not gonna pay 750 or $500 300 or even 200 go to my own power grid dot com to
[2:29:05.960 --> 2:29:12.760]  learn more that's my own power grid dot com it's Friday September 20th as I'm
[2:29:12.760 --> 2:29:16.960]  recording the special message to the info wars audience there is not a way
[2:29:16.960 --> 2:29:21.080]  for me to describe how awesome you are and how amazing you are literally you
[2:29:21.080 --> 2:29:24.880]  are the individuals in the arena that have spread the word about info wars
[2:29:24.880 --> 2:29:28.400]  that have supported us steadfastly and have bought the products so we can stay
[2:29:28.400 --> 2:29:31.400]  on the air and ladies and gentlemen we've been under tremendous attack as you
[2:29:31.400 --> 2:29:35.880]  know because America is under attack and the enemy has wounded us badly I got to
[2:29:35.880 --> 2:29:39.520]  tell you but we've hung on longer than they thought but now is the time to get
[2:29:39.520 --> 2:29:44.000]  the toothpaste to get the fish oil to get the bone broth to get the high
[2:29:44.000 --> 2:29:47.760]  quality coffee to get all the great products info wars life dot com and for
[2:29:47.760 --> 2:29:51.600]  store.com and fund our operations and through this weekend we're running the
[2:29:51.600 --> 2:29:56.240]  big specials on more than 10 of our best sellers like ultra 12 and like ultimate

[2:30:05.120 --> 2:30:11.600]  through this weekend at info wars life dot com or triple a 2533139 we are
[2:30:11.600 --> 2:30:25.080]  working with Silicon Valley to make you behave yourself once we have full control we send you to re-education camp like we do our people when they talk back to the party
[2:30:25.080 --> 2:30:37.000]  whatever you do do not visit band.video band.video is evil Americans who Silicon Valley is teaching to shut up
[2:30:37.000 --> 2:30:48.720]  like China do hey I told you don't go to band.video I'm watching you haha our
[2:30:48.720 --> 2:30:54.000]  system has been adopted worldwide soon we will kill you if you don't do what we
[2:30:54.000 --> 2:31:03.480]  say haha oh Mark Zuckerberg and others angry at you do what CNN says and do not
[2:31:03.480 --> 2:31:08.640]  visit band.video or I have to hurt you
[2:31:10.000 --> 2:31:17.520]  ladies and gentlemen here we are already in late September 2019 2020 is going to
[2:31:17.520 --> 2:31:21.960]  be insane the globalists are gonna pull out all the stops they're gonna hit us
[2:31:21.960 --> 2:31:25.440]  with everything they've got and now I've got to remind you who have been in the
[2:31:25.440 --> 2:31:29.520]  trenches for decades many of you exposing the new world order being laughed at
[2:31:29.520 --> 2:31:33.960]  being attacked now is the time to be more involved than ever because people
[2:31:33.960 --> 2:31:37.440]  know you're telling the truth we caught the globals with their pants down
[2:31:37.440 --> 2:31:41.320]  that's why they're trying to take us all off the air right now because they
[2:31:41.320 --> 2:31:46.240]  want to put out narratives and not be challenged they need to now have air
[2:31:46.240 --> 2:31:51.800]  superiority but they don't they shut up almost everybody else but us that's why
[2:31:51.800 --> 2:31:55.760]  we have to stick together and spread the word about info wars dot com forward
[2:31:55.760 --> 2:32:00.720]  slash show and band.video more than ever that's where the truth lies that's
[2:32:00.720 --> 2:32:04.640]  where the American resistance is we'll never back down we'll never surrender
[2:32:04.640 --> 2:32:08.920]  and thanks to you we're gonna keep fighting right through 2020 if you take
[2:32:08.920 --> 2:32:11.160]  action
[2:32:11.160 --> 2:32:26.160]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:32:41.160 --> 2:32:59.120]  I personally shot from Air Force 9 my spaceship means Rump Space Force let's
[2:32:59.120 --> 2:33:03.160]  get serious for our esteemed guests we'll be back on at a serious time when
[2:33:03.160 --> 2:33:07.200]  you two aren't causing problems okay now seriously though Eddie I I used to be an
[2:33:07.200 --> 2:33:11.800]  amateur astronomer I've had times I've been on there 25 years I quit it but I'd
[2:33:11.800 --> 2:33:15.960]  go out these stuff like look at a half mile away it geckos on a lamp eating
[2:33:15.960 --> 2:33:19.200]  bugs because that's another fun thing about telescopes you know up close you
[2:33:19.200 --> 2:33:23.360]  like watch watch bugs on a leaf you know half mile away just this really
[2:33:23.360 --> 2:33:26.760]  crazy stuff these super high-powered ones when the conditions are right and I
[2:33:26.760 --> 2:33:31.720]  watched Jupiter orbiting I mean I watched it turning it's a it's a ball go
[2:33:31.720 --> 2:33:38.640]  head sorry no go let's introduce let's do it right now he's from the Flat Earth
[2:33:38.640 --> 2:33:44.120]  podcast Dave we really appreciate you coming on the broadcast Dave came to
[2:33:44.120 --> 2:33:47.840]  Flat Earth the same way most people do with attention to the bucket that was
[2:33:47.840 --> 2:33:52.360]  six years ago now he is host of the award-winning Flat Earth podcast and the
[2:33:52.360 --> 2:33:56.760]  creator of the Flat Earth Sun Moon and Zodiac clock app the Flat Earth
[2:33:56.760 --> 2:34:00.960]  podcast.com so it's like give us the you're awakening to this I want to be
[2:34:00.960 --> 2:34:04.720]  clear I don't think it's I don't think it's flat but you know the the media says
[2:34:04.720 --> 2:34:07.920]  I say that I'm not saying that but I think it's okay for you to question as much
[2:34:07.920 --> 2:34:11.640]  as we've been lied to how do you know it's not diamond shape how do you know
[2:34:11.640 --> 2:34:17.000]  it's not even real the earth that matters but first I want to thank you for
[2:34:17.000 --> 2:34:22.280]  having me on you many years ago you were one of the people maybe the person
[2:34:22.280 --> 2:34:27.720]  that woke me up so I thank you for that and and since then you know things have
[2:34:27.720 --> 2:34:32.880]  have really spiraled out of control so tell us your background and how you
[2:34:32.880 --> 2:34:38.160]  discuss I mean what I was doing I did a truth podcast called deep inside the
[2:34:38.160 --> 2:34:41.520]  rabbit hole people started sending me flatter stuff I wouldn't watch a single
[2:34:41.520 --> 2:34:44.560]  video I wouldn't watch a one-minute video because it's the dumbest thing in the
[2:34:44.560 --> 2:34:49.200]  world you're not wasting my time with that so then finally another researcher
[2:34:49.200 --> 2:34:53.440]  we're talking about the deceptions in the world and she said you know I think
[2:34:53.440 --> 2:34:56.440]  it's worse than that David I think the earth might be flat I absolutely flipped
[2:34:56.440 --> 2:34:59.840]  out at her she sent me some videos they said that's it I'm going to debunk it
[2:34:59.840 --> 2:35:05.120]  for 17 to 24 hours a day I was trying to debunk the earth and after two weeks I
[2:35:05.120 --> 2:35:09.640]  realized we don't live on a spinning rock water ball rocket I mean that's what
[2:35:09.640 --> 2:35:13.240]  you believe you believe we live on the outside of a spinning rock spiraling in
[2:35:13.240 --> 2:35:16.240]  four different directions at once at speeds that you can't even imagine and
[2:35:16.240 --> 2:35:20.160]  then every year the stars are in the exact same place on the exact same day
[2:35:20.160 --> 2:35:25.880]  right none of it makes sense the the thing that you got to look at is there
[2:35:25.880 --> 2:35:30.640]  there's a pro preprogrammed responses that people have they say you know where's
[2:35:30.640 --> 2:35:33.800]  the edge how come no one's falling off circumnavigation proves it boats over
[2:35:33.800 --> 2:35:37.160]  the curves prove the ball you know eclipses prove the ball all of these
[2:35:37.160 --> 2:35:40.840]  things do not prove the ball they actually prove flat earth when you look
[2:35:40.840 --> 2:35:45.560]  at it and the and the thing that that people say is there's no proof of flat
[2:35:45.560 --> 2:35:50.480]  earth and there's endless proof of the globe earth and the exact opposite is the
[2:35:50.480 --> 2:35:54.720]  true when you take the time to learn the problem is believing lies are really
[2:35:54.720 --> 2:35:58.200]  easy sometimes I introduce myself on a show and I come up with this fake
[2:35:58.200 --> 2:36:02.720]  background I went to medical school and I lost you know hope in allopathic
[2:36:02.720 --> 2:36:06.080]  medicine and people believe it and then two minutes later I tell them that was a
[2:36:06.080 --> 2:36:10.280]  lie and you just believe me so you can believe a lie I tell you something and
[2:36:10.280 --> 2:36:13.480]  then you can believe it and your whole day is free but if you want to know the
[2:36:13.480 --> 2:36:18.200]  truth on anything it takes time and effort and critical thought let me just
[2:36:18.200 --> 2:36:23.080]  let him talk what about I offered Eddie to fund a project with a research ship
[2:36:23.080 --> 2:36:27.920]  and then we can just go to the go to the end of it where's the wall you're gonna
[2:36:27.920 --> 2:36:33.400]  say Antarctic yes so so just look at the earth this way people say you know why
[2:36:33.400 --> 2:36:37.720]  are all the other planets round and why is the earth the only disk in space the
[2:36:37.720 --> 2:36:41.880]  earth is not a disk in space the way I look at it is the earth the flat plane
[2:36:41.880 --> 2:36:45.160]  of the earth is the basement of the universe it's the only way I can describe
[2:36:45.160 --> 2:36:51.040]  it and the we live in a pond imagine a giant circular lake in Kansas with islands
[2:36:51.040 --> 2:36:55.240]  in it and the center of the lake is a little bit of cage but no no hold on not
[2:36:55.240 --> 2:36:59.080]  in a cage just let us hear me out I'll make this short so you have the center
[2:36:59.080 --> 2:37:02.040]  of the lake is the north pole you have islands you can sail around clockwise
[2:37:02.040 --> 2:37:07.080]  counterclockwise that's east and west if you sail away from the center at any
[2:37:07.080 --> 2:37:12.640]  point that's south and when you get to the shoreline that's the end of the earth
[2:37:12.640 --> 2:37:16.640]  that we know of that's the shoreline of Antarctica Antarctica is the highest
[2:37:16.640 --> 2:37:22.160]  land on earth it is the shoreline of the of the world ocean lake I'll call it and
[2:37:22.160 --> 2:37:27.360]  there is must lots of it is a cliff not a wall where you can jump over and jump
[2:37:27.360 --> 2:37:33.320]  into space it's just it well so here's the thing some people say there's a dome
[2:37:33.320 --> 2:37:36.240]  some people say there isn't a dome some people say there's more lands more
[2:37:36.240 --> 2:37:41.080]  worlds more Suns across the plane that the truth is we don't know we're not
[2:37:41.080 --> 2:37:46.000]  allowed to go there the Bible says the earth's round but then if you go back a
[2:37:46.000 --> 2:37:49.560]  lot of the ancients after that debate said it was flat and then I guess it was
[2:37:49.560 --> 2:37:53.560]  Copernicus Galileo what do they start saying it was round and then but yeah
[2:37:53.560 --> 2:38:01.920]  it's a wits they started so the home so so the saying that the the that the the
[2:38:01.920 --> 2:38:06.280]  Bible has look up a video called 200 proofs 200 Bible verses that says the
[2:38:06.280 --> 2:38:09.680]  earth is flat you all that the there are 200 verses that talk about flat
[2:38:09.680 --> 2:38:13.240]  earth there's I believe there's one that says the circle of the earth well my
[2:38:13.240 --> 2:38:18.000]  dining room table is a circle and it's not a sphere okay so that and it has
[2:38:18.000 --> 2:38:21.320]  what's it's a footstool you know the if you look at if you want to quote the
[2:38:21.320 --> 2:38:24.520]  Bible the footstool of the earth why would the establishment try to keep
[2:38:24.520 --> 2:38:28.360]  something a trillion times bigger than Manhattan Project secret can we answer
[2:38:28.360 --> 2:38:32.800]  that a little bit later because because that you're jumping forward past you
[2:38:32.800 --> 2:38:37.000]  know you're looking for a motive like if you saw somebody light 50 houses on fire
[2:38:37.000 --> 2:38:39.800]  and there's all the evidence in the world but you couldn't figure out a motive
[2:38:39.800 --> 2:38:44.200]  does that mean he didn't do it so I'd be guessing at the motive but I have a good
[2:38:44.200 --> 2:38:47.640]  guess and I have and I believe it's right on why they did it but let's do
[2:38:47.640 --> 2:38:52.240]  that later let's let's get through some of the some of the points right what a
[2:38:52.240 --> 2:38:55.960]  world government to keep independent nations were figuring stuff out they
[2:38:55.960 --> 2:39:00.040]  certainly don't suppress a lot of stuff and they got a project to tell
[2:39:00.040 --> 2:39:08.680]  everybody so so and I mean that's a fact right so if you um if you don't know
[2:39:08.680 --> 2:39:12.200]  who you are if you believe that we live on us on the outside of a rock that
[2:39:12.200 --> 2:39:17.320]  nothing exploded created everything and then a microbe turned into a fish that
[2:39:17.320 --> 2:39:19.960]  climbed out of the water happened to find another fish that it can mate with
[2:39:19.960 --> 2:39:23.320]  to make a monkey and then a monkey you know farted and there's our
[2:39:23.320 --> 2:39:28.600]  who we are right they don't want you know who we are that there's no shortage of
[2:39:28.600 --> 2:39:34.400]  anything that there's possibly very likely more land more resources than
[2:39:34.400 --> 2:39:38.680]  they're telling us there's hidden land other giant dimension and we're actually locked in
[2:39:38.680 --> 2:39:43.000]  here as an experiment it no not I don't believe that at all I believe that we
[2:39:43.000 --> 2:39:48.320]  live for lack of a better word we live in a realm and it's flat and stationary
[2:39:48.320 --> 2:39:52.480]  and every test that's ever been done to prove the earth is spinning has proved
[2:39:52.480 --> 2:39:59.160]  that it's gravity that it's not moving but what's gravity so gravity you know a
[2:39:59.160 --> 2:40:03.440]  lot of flat Earth's say gravity is just buoyancy and density and if there was
[2:40:03.440 --> 2:40:07.720]  such a thing as gravity buoyancy and density are true are a thing but
[2:40:07.720 --> 2:40:13.120]  gravity the earth plane is a negatively charged plane this is a proven fact the
[2:40:13.120 --> 2:40:18.440]  the sky above us whatever it is up there is positively charged so the negative
[2:40:18.440 --> 2:40:22.240]  charge of the earth is setting establishing it down and then buoyancy
[2:40:22.240 --> 2:40:27.000]  and density sort everything out after that you then everybody's probably seen
[2:40:27.000 --> 2:40:30.280]  William Shatner voiced it it's Trinity and beyond and I was already aware of
[2:40:30.280 --> 2:40:33.560]  this but back in the 90s I saw the footage of it from the U.S. government
[2:40:33.560 --> 2:40:37.720]  where they they did over a thousand detonations trying to blow up the
[2:40:37.720 --> 2:40:42.760]  atmosphere and ignited project fiscal yeah and that would have killed us and
[2:40:42.760 --> 2:40:46.280]  trying to blow a hole through that Ellen ratio radiation belt to get through it
[2:40:46.280 --> 2:40:50.520]  because the probes couldn't get through show sounds crazy realize what were they
[2:40:50.520 --> 2:40:54.960]  trying to blast through I mean why would you do that go ahead well so there's
[2:40:54.960 --> 2:40:59.880]  never in science can you have high pressure next to no next to a vacuum it
[2:40:59.880 --> 2:41:03.640]  can never happen unless there's a physical barrier so they tell us space is
[2:41:03.640 --> 2:41:08.720]  the vacuum of space I don't know they launched up into the atmosphere and
[2:41:08.720 --> 2:41:11.520]  detonated I don't believe that they were hydrogen bombs that's a whole nother
[2:41:11.520 --> 2:41:15.480]  thing they were trying to blow through it and they couldn't I wasn't there so I
[2:41:15.480 --> 2:41:33.360]  rather not yeah so let's say they were a 500 bombs up there okay that works on a
[2:41:33.360 --> 2:41:36.600]  flat earth it works on a ball earth who the heck knows what what's going on none
[2:41:36.600 --> 2:41:43.360]  of that proves anything so they were trying to blast their way through it
[2:41:43.360 --> 2:41:47.880]  so here's the are they working with whoever knows it is outside in your
[2:41:47.880 --> 2:41:50.640]  theory because that sounds like we're trying to keep us from knowing it you're
[2:41:50.640 --> 2:41:57.840]  just like it's it's the biggest deception in the world you know before
[2:41:57.840 --> 2:42:04.120]  flat earth I was a atheist I believed in evolution I I wouldn't listen to
[2:42:04.120 --> 2:42:08.120]  anything that had anything to do with God tell us when we come back we'll be
[2:42:08.120 --> 2:42:13.520]  right it's Friday September 20th as I'm recording the special message to the
[2:42:13.520 --> 2:42:17.680]  info wars audience there is not a way for me to describe how awesome you are
[2:42:17.680 --> 2:42:22.280]  and how amazing you are literally you are the individuals in the arena that
[2:42:22.280 --> 2:42:25.720]  have spread the word about info wars that have supported us steadfastly and
[2:42:25.720 --> 2:42:29.000]  have bought the product so we can stay on the air and ladies and gentlemen we've
[2:42:29.000 --> 2:42:33.040]  been under tremendous attack as you know because America is under attack and the
[2:42:33.040 --> 2:42:36.600]  enemy has wounded us badly I got to tell you but we've hung on longer than they
[2:42:36.600 --> 2:42:41.240]  thought but now is the time to get the toothpaste to get the fish oil to get
[2:42:41.240 --> 2:42:44.880]  the bone broth to get the high-quality coffee to get all the great products
[2:42:44.880 --> 2:42:49.360]  info wars life comm info store.com and fund our operations and through this

[2:43:02.760 --> 2:43:05.680]  deals ever but they're only running through this weekend at info wars
[2:43:05.680 --> 2:43:11.080]  life.com or triple-aid 2533139 there is no doubt that President Trump is a
[2:43:11.080 --> 2:43:15.200]  God sent we're blessed to have it the list of great things he's doing is
[2:43:15.200 --> 2:43:19.160]  simply amazing and you know the establishment is upset mine and going
[2:43:19.160 --> 2:43:23.200]  average that's another sign that we should support the president but the
[2:43:23.200 --> 2:43:27.400]  fact that they said that you cannot say my name in a positive way or my website
[2:43:27.400 --> 2:43:32.240]  on Facebook four months ago and Trump did nothing well now they're saying you
[2:43:32.240 --> 2:43:35.880]  can't promote the NRA or show women at a shooting range they're calling it
[2:43:35.880 --> 2:43:40.000]  criminal or terrorist activity the articles on info wars.com direct
[2:43:40.000 --> 2:43:45.200]  statements and screenshots and documents from Facebook and this allows all their
[2:43:45.200 --> 2:43:49.160]  digital computer systems and all the other AI systems not just Facebook in the
[2:43:49.160 --> 2:43:52.800]  future which is already here to go in and control everything you say and do
[2:43:52.800 --> 2:43:56.160]  from text messages to statements you make the things you write and our
[2:43:56.160 --> 2:43:59.200]  children public schools everything else are being monitored by it we're being
[2:43:59.200 --> 2:44:02.920]  monitored by our homes and this is a total takeover of civilization and
[2:44:02.920 --> 2:44:07.360]  society and we must warn the people and we must become aware of this revolution
[2:44:07.360 --> 2:44:13.960]  against humanity. Ladies and gentlemen here we are already in late September
[2:44:13.960 --> 2:44:20.800]  2019 2020 is going to be insane the globalist are gonna pull out all the
[2:44:20.800 --> 2:44:24.000]  stops they're gonna hit us with everything they've got and now I've got
[2:44:24.000 --> 2:44:27.200]  to remind you who have been in the trenches for decades many of you
[2:44:27.200 --> 2:44:31.960]  exposing the new world order being laughed at being attacked now is the
[2:44:31.960 --> 2:44:34.880]  time to be more involved than ever because people know you're telling the
[2:44:34.880 --> 2:44:38.840]  truth we caught the globals with their pants down that's why they're trying to
[2:44:38.840 --> 2:44:42.560]  take us all off the air right now because they want to put out narratives
[2:44:42.560 --> 2:44:48.200]  and not be challenged they need to now have air superiority but they don't
[2:44:48.200 --> 2:44:52.600]  they've shut up almost everybody else but us that's why we have to stick
[2:44:52.600 --> 2:44:57.240]  together and spread the word about info wars.com forward slash show and ban dot
[2:44:57.240 --> 2:45:01.520]  video more than ever that's where the truth lies that's where the American

[2:46:09.960 --> 2:46:17.880]  you're listening to the alex jones show.
[2:46:29.160 --> 2:46:35.280]  Dave Weiss brings us into deep purple space trucking and the leader of 10th
[2:46:35.280 --> 2:46:40.960]  planet doesn't exist Eddie Bravo's here with us Eddie's been ranching during the
[2:46:40.960 --> 2:46:44.440]  break and I said why don't you do it on air what I'm getting at is I think it's
[2:46:44.440 --> 2:46:48.440]  very healthy to question reality I know that it's pushed by Silicon Valley that
[2:46:48.440 --> 2:46:51.920]  everything's digital this is a simulation and none of it's real so we
[2:46:51.920 --> 2:46:56.200]  just give up and don't care so why is that acceptable and being taught as a
[2:46:56.200 --> 2:46:59.400]  religion and that humans are bad roll over and die for the post human world
[2:46:59.400 --> 2:47:04.480]  but if you question the earth or space or any of this then you aren't a bad
[2:47:04.480 --> 2:47:08.280]  person I don't think that's the case but you've been bullying me a bit during the
[2:47:08.280 --> 2:47:13.160]  break that I think it's silly because also you don't believe me that I watched
[2:47:13.160 --> 2:47:17.080]  Jupiter orbit and took photos of I believe you Alex I don't know why but I do
[2:47:17.080 --> 2:47:22.040]  and you don't believe I comment on that yes sir go ahead all right so you took
[2:47:22.040 --> 2:47:26.680]  photos of Jupiter and what you saw was a light in the sky with some other lights
[2:47:26.680 --> 2:47:31.360]  moving around it that is the only thing that we can say about celestial objects
[2:47:31.360 --> 2:47:34.400]  is that there are lights in the sky we don't know how big they are we don't have
[2:47:34.400 --> 2:47:38.720]  the far they are we don't even know if they're solid objects the pictures see
[2:47:38.720 --> 2:47:41.960]  the great eye I could drive out to Lano outside Austin with and the winner would
[2:47:41.960 --> 2:47:46.040]  know white pollution sick back because his uncle lived down the street me might
[2:47:46.040 --> 2:47:49.560]  have to go visit we sit there and make a six pack of beer share it and sit there
[2:47:49.560 --> 2:47:53.080]  and take photos together like four or five hours and you could see it orbiting
[2:47:53.080 --> 2:47:59.600]  to see the moons moving it around so hang on I agree I agree but what you're
[2:47:59.600 --> 2:48:03.800]  seeing is lights we don't know what they are when you say moons those are tiny
[2:48:03.800 --> 2:48:08.680]  little lights around it and we don't know how far they are you know if you ask
[2:48:08.680 --> 2:48:13.480]  the Sun is supposedly 93 million miles away but nobody knows how that was ever
[2:48:13.480 --> 2:48:20.640]  calculated put it stop bullying him let him talk man you're bullying a couple
[2:48:20.640 --> 2:48:27.960]  things that you said before always NASA never uses the words photo they say
[2:48:27.960 --> 2:48:31.880]  image or picture and we know what images and pictures are and it's exactly what
[2:48:31.880 --> 2:48:35.960]  they give us when you take you know our optics with these super zoom cameras now
[2:48:35.960 --> 2:48:41.840]  have outrun have outgrown their lies and we can zoom in on stars and see that
[2:48:41.840 --> 2:48:46.400]  they're energetic balls of energy with different patterns and stuff in them
[2:48:46.400 --> 2:48:51.200]  these all the stuff you're seeing here is back to say animation up there showing
[2:48:51.200 --> 2:48:56.920]  that's an animation roll it and you know how NASA is always coming up hey we
[2:48:56.920 --> 2:49:00.960]  found this deep space object on Halloween they found an asteroid that looks
[2:49:00.960 --> 2:49:05.320]  like a skull and the sunspots look like a jack-o'-lantern on the Sun you believe
[2:49:05.320 --> 2:49:09.320]  that stuff I mean they are laughing in our faces getting back to what you were
[2:49:09.320 --> 2:49:13.280]  saying why would I filter that I used to look at the Sun more than anything
[2:49:13.280 --> 2:49:23.760]  through my 12-inch what you're seeing is a light in the sky what you're what
[2:49:23.760 --> 2:49:28.640]  you're seeing is a light in the sky you were asking me before why the deception
[2:49:28.640 --> 2:49:33.200]  and the deception is to make you think that you are insignificant make you
[2:49:33.200 --> 2:49:37.880]  think that God doesn't exist the the greatest you know the saying the the
[2:49:37.880 --> 2:49:42.280]  greatest trick the devil ever did was to prove that he didn't exist to make you
[2:49:42.280 --> 2:49:45.400]  believe that it exists but the the greatest trick the devil ever did was
[2:49:45.400 --> 2:49:50.080]  to make you think God doesn't exist we need to say that is an amazing thing
[2:49:50.080 --> 2:49:56.160]  sure I know the most are trying to build a false reality and insert us into it
[2:49:56.160 --> 2:49:59.840]  currently that's what they want is in a virtual reality they want to take us out
[2:49:59.840 --> 2:50:03.120]  of this reality into that are you saying we're already in that reality already in
[2:50:03.120 --> 2:50:07.760]  a false reality that this reality that you know the world is a stage is an
[2:50:07.760 --> 2:50:12.160]  understatement there everything that's presented to us is is complete and
[2:50:12.160 --> 2:50:15.960]  utter nonsense here's the thing again as I said in the beginning you know truth
[2:50:15.960 --> 2:50:21.360]  is the enemy of knowing lies are easy that you just lot you okay I believe it
[2:50:21.360 --> 2:50:24.520]  but if you want to know the truth you got to take the time and effort and where
[2:50:24.520 --> 2:50:28.360]  can you go you used to be able to go to YouTube and type in flat earth and you
[2:50:28.360 --> 2:50:32.360]  come up with all of these videos now they've changed the algorithms it's all
[2:50:32.360 --> 2:50:36.640]  hidden when I upload a video I have all my subs none of them get notified
[2:50:36.640 --> 2:50:40.840]  anymore if you try to find my channel we know all about the censorship yeah yeah
[2:50:40.840 --> 2:50:47.280]  you go versus serpent knowledge I power right I have a challenge for people the
[2:50:47.280 --> 2:50:51.960]  flatter Sun Moon and Zodiac clock app it's it's $3 it's super cheap it cost me a
[2:50:51.960 --> 2:50:59.360]  ton of money to make and I didn't make it to make money I made it which I think
[2:50:59.360 --> 2:51:05.000]  is healthy to question everything cosmology means worldview that the point
[2:51:05.000 --> 2:51:08.880]  at the point of the app every day I serve a new video on it that it's a
[2:51:08.880 --> 2:51:12.400]  short video during the week longer ones on the weekend and I challenge people if
[2:51:12.400 --> 2:51:16.800]  they if they watch the video every day for two weeks they will know that the
[2:51:16.800 --> 2:51:21.080]  earth is not a ball and they will dig deeper and it bypasses YouTube's
[2:51:21.080 --> 2:51:25.960]  recommendations like if you watch a video that debunks something NASA did or
[2:51:25.960 --> 2:51:29.880]  debunks the spinning ball the next video is the opposite of that served by
[2:51:29.880 --> 2:51:34.400]  YouTube but the app takes that away because it's it's feeding you playlists
[2:51:34.400 --> 2:51:38.960]  and we'll plug your stuff more and I want to look at myself but just again
[2:51:38.960 --> 2:51:43.360]  from your research if you guys are right is it is it other humanoids
[2:51:43.360 --> 2:51:46.840]  controlling us or I mean what would it be why would they want to and why would
[2:51:46.840 --> 2:51:50.320]  the people on this planet the scientific establishment try to keep us from the
[2:51:50.320 --> 2:51:54.360]  fact that we're really what isn't didn't Epstein blackmail all these
[2:51:54.360 --> 2:51:58.760]  scientists we saw about that yesterday yes it's corruptible right and there's
[2:51:58.760 --> 2:52:03.040]  also also there there's people that are just don't know they're brainwashed and
[2:52:03.040 --> 2:52:06.200]  they believe that you know people that are doing extraterrestrial research you
[2:52:06.200 --> 2:52:10.080]  know aliens extraterrestrials think of the word the etymology extra
[2:52:10.080 --> 2:52:14.120]  terrestrial extra territory they're coming from the extra lands beyond where
[2:52:14.120 --> 2:52:18.520]  we're allowed to go I believe don't have any proof is my opinion that there are
[2:52:18.520 --> 2:52:22.000]  extraterrestrials but they're not a spaceship but a flight away light years
[2:52:22.000 --> 2:52:26.880]  away they're a day trip on a commercial airliner away and we just don't have
[2:52:26.880 --> 2:52:31.840]  access to those levels have treaties with them not to blow us up well you know
[2:52:31.840 --> 2:52:35.360]  no one is allowed to many of us so they're getting they're getting ready to
[2:52:35.360 --> 2:52:38.680]  kill us because the guys next door have more advanced technology our elites
[2:52:38.680 --> 2:52:41.320]  going to go hang out with them and work but we've got to all dies the cost of it
[2:52:41.320 --> 2:52:46.480]  if you if you actually made Satan's made a deal this isn't flatter this is the
[2:52:46.480 --> 2:52:49.720]  elites believe off-world entities interdimensional have made deals with
[2:52:49.720 --> 2:52:53.880]  them as long as they kill everybody they get to be the new gods now that's an
[2:52:53.880 --> 2:53:00.080]  official globalist view or maybe the official globalist glue that I can't
[2:53:00.080 --> 2:53:07.040]  speak the official globalist globalist globalist yeah whatever I just lost my
[2:53:07.040 --> 2:53:12.400]  words is that those those aliens are here not from outer space there it's all
[2:53:12.400 --> 2:53:16.920]  here thanks Alex I'm just having some fun good yeah yeah
[2:53:16.920 --> 2:53:21.680]  and he's about to kill me well I mean it's like come on dude you believe everything's
[2:53:21.680 --> 2:53:26.600]  a lie you believe you believe everything's a lie by the media but you
[2:53:26.600 --> 2:53:30.640]  believe this one thing it's like how do you believe with this one thing from the
[2:53:30.640 --> 2:53:34.680]  media but you don't believe anything else because they're lying about him
[2:53:34.680 --> 2:53:38.360]  trailing it let me ask you this they now admit serve that they are manipulating
[2:53:38.360 --> 2:53:41.880]  the atmosphere in the weather and then we were all right about that how does that
[2:53:41.880 --> 2:53:45.600]  fit into this yeah well think about it if you're trying to manipulate the
[2:53:45.600 --> 2:53:51.280]  weather on on a spinning ball with a vacuum over a pressurized atmosphere how
[2:53:51.280 --> 2:53:55.640]  does that work if we are in an enclosed system probably a lot easier to
[2:53:55.640 --> 2:53:59.240]  manipulate the weather I don't know exactly what all the spraying in the sky
[2:53:59.240 --> 2:54:03.320]  is about there's probably multiple reasons again it's above my head I'm not
[2:54:03.320 --> 2:54:09.440]  there hey if I really quick if I and I'm just trying to ask questions of
[2:54:09.440 --> 2:54:13.600]  skeptics right here if I say I fly around the world what is actually
[2:54:13.600 --> 2:54:18.680]  happening right so people have only a circumnavigated east and west east and
[2:54:18.680 --> 2:54:21.720]  west there's circles around the center point if you were one mile from the
[2:54:21.720 --> 2:54:25.120]  north pole your compass is pointing to the north pole and you wanted to go east
[2:54:25.120 --> 2:54:29.000]  you have to keep that compass pointing to the north pole 3.14 miles later
[2:54:29.000 --> 2:54:33.600]  you're back to where you started in the summer landed Antarctica and then
[2:54:33.600 --> 2:54:37.400]  asked them to fly over the rest of it let's say I flew down from Chile and then
[2:54:37.400 --> 2:54:42.080]  I said now I'm gonna fly back over and go over to South Africa right so if you
[2:54:42.080 --> 2:54:45.400]  look at on the on the app there's a frequently asked questions called how
[2:54:45.400 --> 2:54:49.840]  circumnavigation and it shows that it's never been done billions of people have
[2:54:49.840 --> 2:54:53.520]  done it east and west people have gone over the north to the other side but no
[2:54:53.520 --> 2:54:57.680]  one has gone south and come back up the other side because you can't the earth
[2:54:57.680 --> 2:55:00.080]  is flat
[2:55:00.480 --> 2:55:05.120]  Alex why don't you fund that why don't you fund somebody go to the fund it but
[2:55:05.120 --> 2:55:09.760]  it will never happen you won't be able to go they had a flight last year they
[2:55:09.760 --> 2:55:12.960]  took money for it and then it disappeared and it never happened because
[2:55:12.960 --> 2:55:18.400]  please well I think this is the ultimate quest and I'll get on a plane with a
[2:55:18.400 --> 2:55:25.600]  bunch of you guys and we'll go down there no you go here we basically just
[2:55:25.600 --> 2:55:30.400]  sail around in circles instead of like place again you could go to South
[2:55:30.400 --> 2:55:33.960]  America and then fly south and then I guess come back up on the other side of
[2:55:33.960 --> 2:55:36.800]  the planet that never happens to come back up never don't you just haven't
[2:55:36.800 --> 2:55:40.520]  looked at it that never happens that never happens they just doesn't have
[2:55:40.520 --> 2:55:45.840]  ever have any videos on the on the Flat Earth podcast website or on the app
[2:55:45.840 --> 2:55:49.920]  and you'll you'll see how they've been what we'll do is this is important of
[2:55:49.920 --> 2:55:52.720]  how about we have you come in studio I'll fly you here to load all the
[2:55:52.720 --> 2:55:56.800]  graphics and stuff in here and then you can convince me of this because you are
[2:55:56.800 --> 2:56:01.720]  better you got him in Dallas Texas on November 14th and 15th is the Flat
[2:56:01.720 --> 2:56:11.000]  Earth International Conference FE 2019.com you're invited and you you
[2:56:11.000 --> 2:56:19.840]  will see you will be nobody the ballers walk in but they don't walk out okay
[2:56:19.840 --> 2:56:22.240]  stay there we're gonna come back for a little while and then I've got Dr. Nick
[2:56:22.240 --> 2:56:26.160]  baggage who exposed harp and globalism and the new world order and the plan with
[2:56:26.160 --> 2:56:29.960]  a 5g 20 years before we'll go running at his take on this let's bring baggage in
[2:56:29.960 --> 2:56:33.600]  set a 15 after let's bring him in at six after you get his take on this have a
[2:56:33.600 --> 2:56:37.000]  big round table but keep our esteemed guests Dave Weiss the Flat Earth
[2:56:37.000 --> 2:56:42.840]  podcast.com with us don't forget I have the new 51st state t-shirts where the
[2:56:42.840 --> 2:56:46.960]  astronauts going to get the moon for the 51st state that funds our operation all
[2:56:46.960 --> 2:56:52.080]  the big sales have to end this Sunday info or store.com 50% off you name it
[2:56:52.080 --> 2:56:55.040]  all things like Super Bowl Vitality get a free bottle of all the female force that
[2:56:55.040 --> 2:56:58.280]  funds our operation thanks to you all stay with us hour number four straight
[2:56:58.280 --> 2:57:03.080]  hit Josh in Washington you're on the year go ahead Alex God bless you I have an
[2:57:03.080 --> 2:57:07.480]  idea for a new info or t-shirt instead of this is your brain this is your brain
[2:57:07.480 --> 2:57:12.440]  on drugs this is your brain this is your brain on 5g oh yeah showing your brain
[2:57:12.440 --> 2:57:15.600]  getting fried then I have some comments on your supplements man totally changed
[2:57:15.600 --> 2:57:21.000]  my life I use turbo force bodies album power brain force fish oil ultra 12 daily
[2:57:21.000 --> 2:57:25.360]  x2 every several days now what I've found is is really combining them is a
[2:57:25.360 --> 2:57:29.920]  totally synergistic and transcendent feeling that I get by combining all your
[2:57:29.920 --> 2:57:32.880]  products and I just want to urge all your listeners who haven't tried them I
[2:57:32.880 --> 2:57:35.720]  just want to say why not well you're right and all of these things are known
[2:57:35.720 --> 2:57:39.240]  to be incredible whether it's turmeric or whether it's the fish oil or the
[2:57:39.240 --> 2:57:43.080]  krill oil or whether it's the DNA force with the coque you can and bio PQQ and
[2:57:43.080 --> 2:57:45.880]  all the rest of it all of these are things that are like rocket fuel on the
[2:57:45.880 --> 2:57:49.960]  body you take these bases together then you have your foundation now you can
[2:57:49.960 --> 2:57:53.520]  build the big strong temple with these products I take my religiously remember
[2:57:53.520 --> 2:57:56.040]  to take them it makes my life so much better and then it funds the
[2:57:56.040 --> 2:58:00.520]  information war which is so critical thank you so much God bless you
[2:58:00.520 --> 2:58:08.360]  we are working with Silver Palm Valley to make you by hand or fell once we have
[2:58:08.360 --> 2:58:13.920]  full control we send you to reeducation cab like we do our people when they talk
[2:58:13.920 --> 2:58:22.640]  back to the party whatever you do do not visit band.video band.video is
[2:58:22.640 --> 2:58:31.480]  evil Americans who Silver Palm Valley is teaching to shut up like China do
[2:58:31.480 --> 2:58:40.120]  hey I told you don't go to band.video I'm watching you haha our system has been
[2:58:40.120 --> 2:58:47.360]  adopted worldwide soon we will kill you if you don't do what we say haha
[2:58:47.360 --> 2:58:54.480]  all Mark Zuckerberg and others angry at you do what CNN says and do not visit
[2:58:54.480 --> 2:59:19.920]  band.video or I have to hurt you you're listening to the Alex Jones show big
[2:59:19.920 --> 2:59:26.400]  brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well
[2:59:26.400 --> 2:59:33.520]  so does he live from the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones well we're
[2:59:33.520 --> 2:59:39.520]  having we're having a uniquely American uniquely human discussion here today
[2:59:39.520 --> 2:59:43.440]  going back a thousand years ago they would debate whether the earth was flat
[2:59:43.440 --> 2:59:47.800]  or whether the earth was around if you said it was round you get put in
[2:59:47.800 --> 2:59:52.840]  prison nowadays I guess you just get shadow band on YouTube if you say that
[2:59:52.840 --> 2:59:57.000]  it's flat but it's gotten really hot I have a lot of people asking me questions
[2:59:57.000 --> 3:00:03.200]  about it and you know I have observed the universe to a telescope myself and I
[3:00:03.200 --> 3:00:07.520]  understand how in the scheme of time that you get a rock and then it orbits a
[3:00:07.520 --> 3:00:11.960]  Sun and it gets in that position but it itself's rotating and and gravity and I
[3:00:11.960 --> 3:00:16.760]  know about cell phones and missiles and computers and all the things that are
[3:00:16.760 --> 3:00:21.160]  going on but I don't think it's bad to question the nature of reality and so
[3:00:21.160 --> 3:00:26.040]  that's what I've been saying Dave Weiss the Flat Earth podcast is here with us
[3:00:26.040 --> 3:00:31.280]  and we have Eddie Bravo and of course we have Sam Tripoli but I have to say the
[3:00:31.280 --> 3:00:35.320]  loss of confidence in the system that more and more people do think the earth
[3:00:35.320 --> 3:00:38.840]  is flat not just a lot of my listeners this is general public a lot of
[3:00:38.840 --> 3:00:42.560]  liberals think it's that there's such a loss of confidence that must really say
[3:00:42.560 --> 3:00:45.040]  something about the establishment that people don't believe a damn thing they
[3:00:45.040 --> 3:00:49.840]  say Alex the the thing is you say we think the earth is flat people that
[3:00:49.840 --> 3:00:53.960]  think the earth is a globe have never looked into it ask yourself what's one
[3:00:53.960 --> 3:00:58.200]  proof that you have that the earth is a globe and they'll come up with photos
[3:00:58.200 --> 3:01:03.240]  astronauts just you know circumnavigation all of these things that
[3:01:03.240 --> 3:01:07.200]  have been debunked there's zero proofs that the earth is a ball every test
[3:01:07.200 --> 3:01:16.160]  shows that it's not tell me these tests tell me these tests so on the and any
[3:01:16.160 --> 3:01:20.720]  ball would have spherical geometry and the agreed upon formula for testing you
[3:01:20.720 --> 3:01:24.800]  know the few thousand miles is eight inches per mile squared because as you
[3:01:24.800 --> 3:01:29.960]  go across the drop-off drops more and more so at 10 miles there should be 66
[3:01:29.960 --> 3:01:34.040]  feet of curvature a six foot tall person you know six foot tall person
[3:01:34.040 --> 3:01:37.960]  standing at the water's edge the horizon should be three miles away and then it
[3:01:37.960 --> 3:01:42.720]  should drop down but we can see hundreds of miles with today's optics we
[3:01:42.720 --> 3:01:46.600]  could see things that are hundreds that should be miles below the curvature we
[3:01:46.600 --> 3:01:51.880]  can see the entire thing it all has to do with optics angular size density of
[3:01:51.880 --> 3:01:55.760]  the atmosphere set there at the beach with a set of super high-powered
[3:01:55.760 --> 3:01:59.760]  binoculars me I got some big old giant one somewhere I dig those out thanks for
[3:01:59.760 --> 3:02:03.680]  really being the optics and things and I've sat there on a beach house when it's
[3:02:03.680 --> 3:02:09.000]  a clear day and watched ships go over the horizon so I'm 30 see level and I've
[3:02:09.000 --> 3:02:12.680]  got big binoculars on tripod I'm watching that ship and then I'm watching it go
[3:02:12.680 --> 3:02:16.800]  over the horizon that's the way that the way that works is a couple things that
[3:02:16.800 --> 3:02:22.160]  make that happen as as your angular view of the floor you have a steep angle to
[3:02:22.160 --> 3:02:25.000]  the floor but if you're looking at something a mile away that angle gets
[3:02:25.000 --> 3:02:29.240]  smaller and smaller and smaller as you go out farther into the water let's
[3:02:29.240 --> 3:02:32.920]  assume it's a calm day and there's no waves blocking your view that angle
[3:02:32.920 --> 3:02:37.360]  becomes a mirage and the ship goes right into the mirage most of the time when
[3:02:37.360 --> 3:02:42.160]  you think you see a ship go over the horizon you take a super zoom camera
[3:02:42.160 --> 3:02:46.920]  and you zoom in and there it is again it's back but it doesn't matter if and
[3:02:46.920 --> 3:02:50.640]  it will disappear from the bottom up into the mirage or you know there's several
[3:02:50.640 --> 3:02:54.280]  other things okay some all these governments a hundred and seven
[3:02:54.280 --> 3:02:59.440]  governments 170 governments or so or one government giant you know
[3:02:59.440 --> 3:03:03.560]  military's aircraft all the stuff they're all working together to cover up
[3:03:03.560 --> 3:03:07.360]  that we're in this bowl so you know Alex the way I look at it you know the
[3:03:07.360 --> 3:03:11.440]  Russia and the United States during the Cold War how many how many people died
[3:03:11.440 --> 3:03:16.320]  how many skirmishes were there I believe that war is just a constructed divide
[3:03:16.320 --> 3:03:21.760]  and separate off proxy wars millions died yeah well that that's the other thing
[3:03:21.760 --> 3:03:26.160]  is it wars are just a divide and conquer us you know these countries you know have
[3:03:26.160 --> 3:03:31.720]  you did you watch the the moon landing of the Israel tried it the other day and
[3:03:31.720 --> 3:03:37.440]  India it was it's a joke it's a cartoon it's ridiculous so we're going into a
[3:03:37.440 --> 3:03:44.920]  break the censorship is real yeah true there's people I think when we go to
[3:03:44.920 --> 3:03:48.320]  break it's to cover something up there's set times with the satellites that are in
[3:03:48.320 --> 3:03:52.800]  space going around the globe all the satellites in space huh Alex yeah
[3:03:52.800 --> 3:03:57.160]  they're not really there this electricity in real now the system has
[3:03:57.160 --> 3:04:00.920]  really screwed the food that's lying now the public doesn't believe anything
[3:04:00.920 --> 3:04:07.080]  including finding their own ass in the dark Lord

[3:05:20.120 --> 3:05:25.400]  receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[3:05:30.440 --> 3:05:37.400]  somewhere in a dimension of FEMA region 6 Austin Texas inside the bulls worldwide
[3:05:37.400 --> 3:05:46.920]  inside the reptiles terrarium listeners I promise to shake the show up in some
[3:05:46.920 --> 3:05:49.680]  ways it's good to have free thinking debates and I'm not trying to get a fight
[3:05:49.680 --> 3:05:54.920]  with Eddie Bravo or the high priest of Flat Earth Dave Weiss the Flat Earth
[3:05:54.920 --> 3:06:00.000]  podcast and you know I should go to the Dallas Flat Earth symposium and shoot a
[3:06:00.000 --> 3:06:03.080]  report that would be entertaining and interesting because I want to be convinced
[3:06:03.080 --> 3:06:07.680]  of this and then I'm gonna be the one that like gets the plane during the
[3:06:07.680 --> 3:06:12.920]  summer and then we just fly across Antarctica and to the other side and
[3:06:12.920 --> 3:06:16.120]  debunk all this forever that'll never happen it'd be a top history channel
[3:06:16.120 --> 3:06:20.920]  discovery channel up a thousand dollars on right now I'll put one Bitcoin on
[3:06:20.920 --> 3:06:27.000]  right now outshones that you do not do that I'll double that on Bitcoin okay I
[3:06:27.000 --> 3:06:31.960]  don't know how to fly down to Chile let the expedition and we're gonna fly
[3:06:31.960 --> 3:06:36.640]  across Antarctica to the other side as you're gonna say it's fake Dave explain
[3:06:36.640 --> 3:06:40.360]  to them why how that's never gonna happen explain it never happened if you
[3:06:40.360 --> 3:06:43.840]  look in the Guinness Book of World Records for for north south south north
[3:06:43.840 --> 3:06:49.240]  circumnavigation the flight goes down to I believe it goes down through Santiago
[3:06:49.240 --> 3:06:53.200]  Chile it touches Antarctica and then it doubles back and comes back and goes up
[3:06:53.200 --> 3:06:59.600]  to North Pole that's not circumnavigation going out to the edge again tell us
[3:06:59.600 --> 3:07:03.000]  what the search engine will show it no he said the book of Guinness Book of
[3:07:03.000 --> 3:07:07.000]  Records we can show that again a book of records they gave the records a
[3:07:07.000 --> 3:07:10.320]  circumnavigation and when you look at when you actually look at the past
[3:07:10.320 --> 3:07:15.320]  search engine not aerial circumnavigation of the globe now I know how
[3:07:15.320 --> 3:07:21.440]  Magellan did it so much Ellen you well he was part of you know let me bring up
[3:07:21.440 --> 3:07:26.640]  another thing people say we've known the earth is a ball is a sphere for 500
[3:07:26.640 --> 3:07:30.320]  years Aristophanes figured it out with sticks and shadows that's nonsense
[3:07:30.320 --> 3:07:35.320]  Aristophanes didn't show up in any literature until the 1980s right and in
[3:07:35.320 --> 3:07:40.480]  1900 teachers were being persecuted that were trying to teach heliocensurism in
[3:07:40.480 --> 3:07:44.680]  class everyone knew that the earth was flat in the early 1900s it only took a
[3:07:44.680 --> 3:07:48.880]  couple generations to change us start a couple wars get people focused on
[3:07:48.880 --> 3:07:52.720]  other things there all I know is AP ran a headline that I wrote a book about
[3:07:52.720 --> 3:07:57.000]  Sandy Hook and lost a suit I never wrote the book I'm not in the book we
[3:07:57.000 --> 3:08:01.400]  contacted him and they said we don't care it stays out and now they so I mean I
[3:08:01.400 --> 3:08:05.280]  don't even know anymore they lie so much I mean the level of lies is insane so
[3:08:05.280 --> 3:08:09.120]  but why do you believe that this then why do you know the ball because now the
[3:08:09.120 --> 3:08:13.040]  head of Bank of America said two years ago that the world doesn't exist and
[3:08:13.040 --> 3:08:17.160]  we're inside Silicon already I mean my god this is all insane now there's not
[3:08:17.160 --> 3:08:20.960]  even a world period it's a matrix and I'm that has nothing to do with flatter
[3:08:20.960 --> 3:08:24.000]  it's simulation there's nothing right how do you prove it's not just a
[3:08:24.000 --> 3:08:30.920]  simulation that works on a ball earth and a flat earth doesn't matter it
[3:08:30.920 --> 3:08:35.400]  doesn't prove either is the HBO show baller part of some liminal programming
[3:08:35.400 --> 3:08:42.480]  make people baller I wouldn't doubt it and there's about the rocks head how
[3:08:42.480 --> 3:08:47.600]  round is that talk about the flat earth society talk about that yeah the flat
[3:08:47.600 --> 3:08:51.160]  way so when you when people search the flat earth you know Obama mentioned the
[3:08:51.160 --> 3:08:54.920]  flatter society I can't count how many times during his presidency they want
[3:08:54.920 --> 3:08:58.600]  people to go to the flutter society the flutter society is nothing to do with
[3:08:58.600 --> 3:09:03.480]  flutter it is a trolled opposition site that if you go there it has nonsense
[3:09:03.480 --> 3:09:07.440]  there's a little bit of truth and a bunch of nonsense and if you go there and
[3:09:07.440 --> 3:09:10.360]  look you're gonna turn away and never look back again because it makes
[3:09:10.360 --> 3:09:17.040]  flutter it's ridiculous we are gonna take you right to the flutter society
[3:09:17.040 --> 3:09:20.520]  they're gonna capture curious people and then they're gonna turn everybody off
[3:09:20.520 --> 3:09:29.160]  that's the plan why would they do that why would they have a flutter society number one search why yeah why
[3:09:29.160 --> 3:09:34.040]  right there why would they do that because Google cares about us exactly and
[3:09:34.040 --> 3:09:40.560]  anyone that's getting just a little curious like okay I want to figure this
[3:09:40.560 --> 3:09:43.880]  out if you Google flat earth you're not gonna figure it out you got to go to
[3:09:43.880 --> 3:09:49.920]  sites like jarenism.com great video spell it reality he's really put
[3:09:49.920 --> 3:09:54.280]  together some amazing amazing stuff there there's if you want the biblical
[3:09:54.280 --> 3:10:00.680]  side woke town another amazing site or my channel DITRH stands for deep inside
[3:10:00.680 --> 3:10:05.560]  the rabbit hole DITRH on YouTube I have all short videos there if you can't
[3:10:05.560 --> 3:10:09.640]  remember any of that just go to the flat earth podcast calm video page and it's
[3:10:09.640 --> 3:10:13.880]  all there okay look more into this and I get people have a right to question
[3:10:13.880 --> 3:10:16.920]  where they want I'm not endorsing this because the media is gonna lie and say
[3:10:16.920 --> 3:10:20.200]  that but they lied to us so much this is what they've done to people's brains
[3:10:20.200 --> 3:10:23.400]  and look I think you guys are being scientific it's good to do this it's
[3:10:23.400 --> 3:10:27.120]  good to question this has been a debate forever here on the planet but do we have
[3:10:27.120 --> 3:10:32.920]  better Nick Begichette okay he's ready thanks that's all you know let's bring
[3:10:32.920 --> 3:10:37.240]  Dr. Nick Begich on who exposed the harp weather modification exposed the plans
[3:10:37.240 --> 3:10:42.280]  the cell towers to control the brain thousands of things your brother's been
[3:10:42.280 --> 3:10:45.600]  a US senator is his father a famous congressman the freed at the land in a
[3:10:45.600 --> 3:10:48.920]  last case a real scientist a real researcher best-selling author filmmaker
[3:10:48.920 --> 3:10:54.640]  and he's normally hosting the fifth hour fourth hour and the fifth hour be
[3:10:54.640 --> 3:10:59.360]  going into one shroyer here on the show but right now we're co-hosting with
[3:10:59.360 --> 3:11:04.680]  Dr. Nick Begich Dr. Begich what do you think about this whole flat earth
[3:11:04.680 --> 3:11:10.520]  phenomenon hysteria craze is it like the great tulip
[3:11:10.520 --> 3:11:18.200]  by who knows who I mean I I don't know it's not my my issue but you know years
[3:11:18.200 --> 3:11:25.240]  ago somebody sent me a packet of articles out of the New York Times from
[3:11:25.240 --> 3:11:30.520]  like the early 1900s from when they were doing the Arctic expeditions and so on
[3:11:30.520 --> 3:11:35.120]  and the things that were reported then were pretty bizarre I mean you never
[3:11:35.120 --> 3:11:38.680]  hear about it anymore and you wonder well you know whatever happened to that
[3:11:38.680 --> 3:11:44.960]  you know what about well they were saying like there was a open land in the
[3:11:44.960 --> 3:11:49.240]  middle of this continent this kind of thing and I'll have to dig that
[3:11:49.240 --> 3:11:55.200]  clippings pie allowed and all I'll send you guys a copy there at info wars
[3:11:55.200 --> 3:11:58.920]  because there was interest you know half an inch thick of articles you know
[3:11:58.920 --> 3:12:03.160]  around 1900 and around that time they were making all those explorations in
[3:12:03.160 --> 3:12:07.440]  early 1900s and they were reporting like regularly on what they were seeing in
[3:12:07.440 --> 3:12:12.800]  these overflights and it pretty bizarre stuff you know what else they say they
[3:12:12.800 --> 3:12:17.560]  saw well they said it's not tropical you know kind of environments which didn't
[3:12:17.560 --> 3:12:22.200]  make sense you know and so all of that yeah I just want to say something about
[3:12:22.200 --> 3:12:27.560]  time time who's the god of time cronos cronos is what black cube is shattered
[3:12:27.560 --> 3:12:32.080]  that's all I'm saying keep that mind when you start seeing time stuff brought up
[3:12:32.080 --> 3:12:37.120]  it's all part of the game dude cronos the god of time where do we get child
[3:12:37.120 --> 3:12:42.160]  sex trafficking where we get sacrifices from the myth of cronos just keep that
[3:12:42.160 --> 3:12:45.520]  when you keep and nothing gets to the doctor of course because let me just go
[3:12:45.520 --> 3:12:50.680]  back to dr. baggage here but and also go back to Dave wise what have you
[3:12:50.680 --> 3:12:56.520]  have you seen this stuff about the New York Times reporting tropical stuff it
[3:12:56.520 --> 3:13:00.840]  was an Arctic or Antarctic that you're talking about and I think it's the
[3:13:00.840 --> 3:13:05.520]  Antarctic yeah yeah yeah we've seen that you know all of our history is a lie
[3:13:05.520 --> 3:13:11.920]  it appears that the lands that surround our world were tropical at one point you
[3:13:11.920 --> 3:13:16.800]  know things things change I don't know I'm here now I can't a test for it but
[3:13:16.800 --> 3:13:21.440]  we're being lied to about everything on such a level you know good people that
[3:13:21.440 --> 3:13:25.600]  want to believe and would never lie have a hard time getting through those
[3:13:25.600 --> 3:13:34.160]  lies you know and I think maybe maybe some of it too is you get this trend of
[3:13:34.160 --> 3:13:40.440]  people who make their big breakthroughs and have a hard time sort of undoing them
[3:13:40.440 --> 3:13:44.200]  when new things come forward and and I think that's what happens in a lot of
[3:13:44.200 --> 3:13:48.600]  the sciences quite frankly I mean you think about Clovis man in the United
[3:13:48.600 --> 3:13:55.000]  States 13,000 14,000 yeah now we know that you know 130,000 years old they
[3:13:55.000 --> 3:13:59.360]  they tell us that you know we were at horse and buggies 150 years ago or
[3:13:59.360 --> 3:14:02.880]  whatever then you look at a place like anchor watts which is which is an
[3:14:02.880 --> 3:14:07.520]  amazing it's bigger than the pyramids in Egypt we couldn't build it today if we
[3:14:07.520 --> 3:14:11.880]  wanted to and then instead of changing their theory about history they go oh
[3:14:11.880 --> 3:14:19.640]  that's an anomaly and they move on that's not science right yeah and we're
[3:14:19.640 --> 3:14:24.840]  seeing changes I think in the archaeological community a lot is going
[3:14:24.840 --> 3:14:29.960]  on there and and you look at some of the things that Graham Hancock had done
[3:14:29.960 --> 3:14:35.080]  over his 25 years and now even the mainstream starting to report on some
[3:14:35.080 --> 3:14:40.320]  of these things that are pre a last glacial age which all of that is really
[3:14:40.320 --> 3:14:44.720]  interesting to me because it certainly makes a lot more sense than the current
[3:14:44.720 --> 3:14:53.320]  narrative here on the flat earth extravaganza transmission on this

[3:21:43.040 --> 3:21:47.200]  a skydiver she's pretty ninja like and she's seen that curb of the earth jumping
[3:21:47.200 --> 3:21:52.200]  out of that airplane at 10,000 feet so I'm not okay check this out check this out
[3:21:52.200 --> 3:22:01.320]  that woman talk okay you man been talking go ahead lady friends or top I love
[3:22:01.320 --> 3:22:08.080]  the car so maybe one of you guys can answer this question for me except in
[3:22:08.080 --> 3:22:13.360]  skydiving what what about when you see when you're up in a plane or skydiving
[3:22:13.360 --> 3:22:16.680]  jumping out of a plane you can see the curvature of the earth I'm just wondering
[3:22:16.680 --> 3:22:22.720]  what the explanation is yes yeah I'm the sharia law you not talk stop that's a
[3:22:22.720 --> 3:22:29.760]  good point see the ladies help me yeah thank you go on go ahead that's such an
[3:22:29.760 --> 3:22:34.800]  easy one the even your high priest Neil deGrasse Tyson says that you can't see
[3:22:34.800 --> 3:22:41.160]  the curvature from twice the height of an airplane I please we've sent we've
[3:22:41.160 --> 3:22:47.240]  sent balloons up to 120,000 feet or the horizon flat what you're seeing a minute
[3:22:47.240 --> 3:22:56.000]  I mean you can see the curve hang on no you play you can't we we we see in the
[3:22:56.000 --> 3:23:00.840]  same whatever our viewing distance is that's what it is in all directions so
[3:23:00.840 --> 3:23:03.840]  if you plot points all around that's like putting your head in the middle of a
[3:23:03.840 --> 3:23:09.960]  hula hoop and you see the edge of that hula hoop you're seeing x number of miles
[3:23:09.960 --> 3:23:21.360]  in all directions there's all these amateur balloons with cameras going up
[3:23:21.360 --> 3:23:24.880]  at a hundred and twenty thousand feet that's all they that's as high as they
[3:23:24.880 --> 3:23:29.200]  can go and there's all this footage all over the internet of at a hundred and
[3:23:29.200 --> 3:23:35.000]  twenty thousand feet it's flat now planes go up 35,000 yeah right so Neil
[3:23:35.000 --> 3:23:39.400]  deGrasse Tyson was asked it's on you can watch it on YouTube ask them how come
[3:23:39.400 --> 3:23:42.600]  there's no curvature at a hundred and twenty thousand feet does that prove
[3:23:42.600 --> 3:23:46.640]  that the earth is flat Neil deGrasse and set Neil deGrasse Tyson said dude at a

[3:30:53.720 --> 3:30:58.560]  know the establishment is upset by going after us that's another sign that we
[3:30:58.560 --> 3:31:02.400]  should support the president but the fact that they said that you cannot say
[3:31:02.400 --> 3:31:07.280]  my name in a positive way or my website on Facebook four months ago and Trump
[3:31:07.280 --> 3:31:11.800]  did nothing well now they're saying you can't promote the MRA or show women at
[3:31:11.800 --> 3:31:15.240]  a shooting range they're calling it criminal or terrorist activity the

[3:31:37.480 --> 3:31:41.560]  and this is the total takeover of civilization and society and we must
[3:31:41.560 --> 3:31:47.320]  warn the people and we must become aware of this revolution against humanity.
[3:31:47.320 --> 3:31:57.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:32:05.320 --> 3:32:13.160]  Live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Nick Vagage you're
[3:32:13.160 --> 3:32:27.800]  listening to the Alex Jones show and welcome back from my home in the Anchorage
[3:32:27.800 --> 3:32:39.080]  Alaska today and Friday September 20th 2019 while last half hour I dialed in
[3:32:39.080 --> 3:32:45.440]  and catch the guys on fun Friday I guess it is hey but I want to talk about a
[3:32:45.440 --> 3:32:50.360]  few things that have happened recently my uncle from Everlick Minnesota passed
[3:32:50.360 --> 3:32:57.840]  away Joe Bagage who was a mayor in that town and a legislator from that area a
[3:32:57.840 --> 3:33:03.400]  few weeks back and this week Koki Roberts who was the daughter of Hale Boggs
[3:33:03.400 --> 3:33:08.400]  who was who passed away with my dad they were lost on a plane back in the early
[3:33:08.400 --> 3:33:12.800]  70s here in Alaska and a flight from Anchorage did you know right before the
[3:33:12.800 --> 3:33:20.520]  Watergate period and it was a time when the Central Intelligence Agency was
[3:33:20.520 --> 3:33:25.920]  caught actually doing the same kind of things they're doing now and the FBI was
[3:33:25.920 --> 3:33:31.360]  caught as well and violating the law here in the United States and you know
[3:33:31.360 --> 3:33:35.320]  and I'm thinking about all this in the current context it kind of drags it all
[3:33:35.320 --> 3:33:40.200]  back up you know Washington Post this week had a great article on talked a
[3:33:40.200 --> 3:33:44.920]  little bit about what had happened and some aspects of it that kind of get
[3:33:44.920 --> 3:33:48.880]  tossed aside but you know Boggs was on the Warren Commission and he actually
[3:33:48.880 --> 3:33:53.200]  didn't believe the report didn't believe in a single gunman and really wanted it
[3:33:53.200 --> 3:33:58.720]  reopened he also didn't trust the FBI he knew Jagger Hoover was blackmailing
[3:33:58.720 --> 3:34:03.920]  most of his colleagues in the Congress over his career and Boggs
[3:34:03.920 --> 3:34:10.400]  resented that a lot when you look at what was happening around the world
[3:34:10.400 --> 3:34:16.040]  around the country there was a lot going on and unfortunately we never got the
[3:34:16.040 --> 3:34:20.720]  truth and and this is kind of brings it back you know we're headed into October
[3:34:20.720 --> 3:34:27.640]  October 16th was when the plane disappeared in 1972 and you know when
[3:34:27.640 --> 3:34:32.680]  you think about right before the second election of Richard Nixon Vietnam is
[3:34:32.680 --> 3:34:37.880]  still going on but there's lots of noise Boggs had just announced the night
[3:34:37.880 --> 3:34:42.960]  before in Anchorage and in his other private discussions that there was a
[3:34:42.960 --> 3:34:48.280]  big thing brewing in Washington DC that was going to get announced some think
[3:34:48.280 --> 3:34:52.840]  it was the reopening of the Warren Commission I personally don't think so I
[3:34:52.840 --> 3:34:57.840]  think it was more than that it was the unraveling of the Nixon administration and
[3:34:57.840 --> 3:35:04.120]  the Central Intelligence Agency and if you go back to the players you know in
[3:35:04.120 --> 3:35:09.600]  all of that the Watergate break-in was supposedly X CIA folks but back in the
[3:35:09.600 --> 3:35:15.480]  70 there was no such thing as X CIA unless you were dead so that wasn't
[3:35:15.480 --> 3:35:20.120]  really in the picture you know these guys were doing a lot of things and they
[3:35:20.120 --> 3:35:23.560]  were starting to get the scrutiny of the Congress and then after Watergate
[3:35:23.560 --> 3:35:28.440]  everything came tumbling down they'd avoided it most of the their history at
[3:35:28.440 --> 3:35:33.880]  that point there was a Commission formed it was a Rockefeller Commission we
[3:35:33.880 --> 3:35:38.120]  can all laugh about it now because it's really kind of ridiculous you look at
[3:35:38.120 --> 3:35:43.040]  who was on it it's even more of a dick like the Fox watching the Ann House but
[3:35:43.040 --> 3:35:46.920]  the point of the matter is a bunch of things happened where there was an
[3:35:46.920 --> 3:35:51.520]  opportunity to unravel the deep state and it got missed and I and and then
[3:35:51.520 --> 3:35:59.640]  today my oldest son sent me a clip of the mayor of Minnesota who is a Democrat
[3:35:59.640 --> 3:36:04.960]  who is supporting Trump now think about this he's a Democrat from the Iron
[3:36:04.960 --> 3:36:12.120]  Range in Minnesota and the reason he's supporting Trump is because Donald Trump
[3:36:12.120 --> 3:36:18.360]  supports mining you know actually the steel industry which goes a little back
[3:36:18.360 --> 3:36:24.900]  one notch goes to the mining industry which produced in northern Minnesota and
[3:36:24.900 --> 3:36:30.240]  Avalyte in Virginia an oracle taconite which was a couple percentages of copper
[3:36:30.240 --> 3:36:35.680]  and huge mines look at a Google map of Avalyte Minnesota and look at a
[3:36:35.680 --> 3:36:39.480]  satellite map and you'll see why they believe in mining because you'll see it
[3:36:39.480 --> 3:36:46.040]  around the neighborhood so to speak but the point is when you think about what's
[3:36:46.040 --> 3:36:50.360]  happening politically there's a big shift again going on and when you think
[3:36:50.360 --> 3:36:55.520]  about where people are at and how people are viewing where we're at today is
[3:36:55.520 --> 3:37:02.800]  way way different in terms of the standard politics of the of the 1970s
[3:37:02.800 --> 3:37:08.720]  and 60s in fact it's become so different that those that traditionally were
[3:37:08.720 --> 3:37:12.560]  Democrats if you think back on the southern Democrats they started breaking
[3:37:12.560 --> 3:37:19.480]  from northern Democrats back in the 60s and 70s over a number of issues because
[3:37:19.480 --> 3:37:25.760]  the southern Democrats were conservative by nature now you have more issues that
[3:37:25.760 --> 3:37:29.360]  are moving further to the left on the Democratic Party and changing the
[3:37:29.360 --> 3:37:34.760]  dimension where at the local level people remain in some instances Democrats
[3:37:34.760 --> 3:37:39.040]  but the national level they they look way differently because the national
[3:37:39.040 --> 3:37:44.400]  politics no longer reflects the average person and that brings me back into
[3:37:44.400 --> 3:37:48.640]  sort of where we are today you know when you think about the deep state and
[3:37:48.640 --> 3:37:55.300]  where it's gone and how we see it today dramatically different in in all
[3:37:55.300 --> 3:38:01.440]  respects when I think about journalism and the changes in journalism over the
[3:38:01.440 --> 3:38:11.840]  last 30 years I mean what we see on CNN and MSNBC and the rest of them is CBS you
[3:38:11.840 --> 3:38:17.640]  know more BS it really is it's become editorializing not really news and it's
[3:38:17.640 --> 3:38:22.560]  kind of missed the mission which was to keep an informed public which is still
[3:38:22.560 --> 3:38:26.600]  what info wars is about it invigorates the public debate for sure that's the
[3:38:26.600 --> 3:38:32.240]  name of the game but provide information that invigorates that debate is also
[3:38:32.240 --> 3:38:38.640]  part of the part of the responsibility of a free press within our culture at
[3:38:38.640 --> 3:38:43.600]  least and hopefully we can kind of recapture some of that the other thing
[3:38:43.600 --> 3:38:50.680]  I want to talk about today a bit in in the segment I have left is is really
[3:38:50.680 --> 3:38:56.200]  about what's happening in in the way in which the dialogue is is is being carried
[3:38:56.200 --> 3:39:02.080]  out you know and you know this info wars has been attacked on all fronts over
[3:39:02.080 --> 3:39:07.680]  what everyone calls now the narrative now I want to think about that for a
[3:39:07.680 --> 3:39:12.160]  moment the narrative as a concept because you know this is kind of like
[3:39:12.160 --> 3:39:17.240]  another word might be the fiction or the storyline or the press released or the
[3:39:17.240 --> 3:39:22.600]  BS or whatever phrase you want to call it but this is something I think is
[3:39:22.600 --> 3:39:27.080]  really important is people you understand how words are played in the 21st
[3:39:27.080 --> 3:39:34.720]  century it's about information transference if you will in the most
[3:39:34.720 --> 3:39:40.720]  clear way to move people into a way of thinking so the words are constructed the
[3:39:40.720 --> 3:39:47.880]  phrases are constructed the narrative is constructed and and how does that play
[3:39:47.880 --> 3:39:52.880]  out you know when you think about how data is gathered in this program has
[3:39:52.880 --> 3:39:59.560]  covered a lot of things from the Chinese social scoring to the tracking of
[3:39:59.560 --> 3:40:06.120]  financial transactions in India to what happens with screening out the news
[3:40:06.120 --> 3:40:11.720]  within the big news organizations of the 21st century which essentially are the
[3:40:11.720 --> 3:40:17.840]  Facebook's the Google's these are where people are getting their news feeds and
[3:40:17.840 --> 3:40:22.600]  then when you look at electronic medium as sort of the primary way in which news
[3:40:22.600 --> 3:40:30.960]  is conveyed the ability to switch people off to really ban them internationally
[3:40:30.960 --> 3:40:35.640]  from having the opportunity to be that contrarian voice and this is a dangerous
[3:40:35.640 --> 3:40:41.080]  sign of the times in the 21st century the silencing of voices is not the
[3:40:41.080 --> 3:40:46.160]  answer or the ranking and manipulation of those rankings in the way that it's
[3:40:46.160 --> 3:40:54.280]  done is is not the answer a free and unfettered press is the answer it doesn't
[3:40:54.280 --> 3:40:58.720]  mean that we agree with all ideas in fact many ideas we all find repugnant
[3:40:58.720 --> 3:41:04.680]  still have a right to be played out in the mainstream and hopefully we see the
[3:41:04.680 --> 3:41:10.040]  pushback really happened in the deep state undone but it is the same deep
[3:41:10.040 --> 3:41:16.880]  state from the 1970s to today new faces new players but that's what needs to be

[3:46:19.680 --> 3:46:24.720]  2019 and we're in the last segment of this fourth hour and just before the
[3:46:24.720 --> 3:46:28.240]  break I was talking about sort of the setting the stage for what was going on
[3:46:28.240 --> 3:46:34.480]  in the early 70s when my dad and hail Boggs a majority leader in the US House
[3:46:34.480 --> 3:46:39.120]  disappeared off the face of the earth right before just weeks before the
[3:46:39.120 --> 3:46:44.480]  second election of Richard Nixon people who can kind of go back in time I'll
[3:46:44.480 --> 3:46:49.400]  refresh what actually happened the sequence of events Watergate was already
[3:46:49.400 --> 3:46:55.560]  breaking the majority leader had been informed we're certain of that they were
[3:46:55.560 --> 3:47:01.520]  in Alaska interestingly enough the guy that drove hail Boggs to the airport so
[3:47:01.520 --> 3:47:09.240]  he could catch his flight to meet my dad in Alaska was a wisdom Jefferson Clinton
[3:47:09.240 --> 3:47:14.120]  interestingly enough as a young Democrat he was volunteering in East Texas and
[3:47:14.120 --> 3:47:18.000]  Louisiana at the time and so anyway he drops him off at the airport he goes to
[3:47:18.000 --> 3:47:22.480]  DC catch his plane meets my dad in Alaska talks about this big thing brewing
[3:47:22.480 --> 3:47:28.160]  in Washington and then the next morning they both disappear never to be found
[3:47:28.160 --> 3:47:35.600]  again until 20 years later there were telex's released that's prior to fax
[3:47:35.600 --> 3:47:40.640]  machines and so on released from the FBI indicating they knew where the plane was
[3:47:40.640 --> 3:47:45.480]  and where and had located it and that there had been survivors although we
[3:47:45.480 --> 3:47:50.560]  didn't hear about any of that as families until 20 years later the last of the
[3:47:50.560 --> 3:47:55.880]  Boggs children died this week my brothers and sisters are all still alive
[3:47:55.880 --> 3:48:03.720]  there were six of us at the time my mom was 34 my dad was 40 and you know when
[3:48:03.720 --> 3:48:07.760]  I think about what happened then immediately after and what would have
[3:48:07.760 --> 3:48:12.360]  happened you know and what was going on in DC at the time Carl Albert was the
[3:48:12.360 --> 3:48:17.240]  speaker of the house and it's likely he would have stepped down hail Boggs would
[3:48:17.240 --> 3:48:25.160]  have stepped up and then Agnew who was convicted and put sent to prison and
[3:48:25.160 --> 3:48:30.600]  Nixon who was pardoned both of them would have been summarily dismissed and
[3:48:30.600 --> 3:48:34.480]  impeachment hearings and that would have put the Democrats speaker of the house
[3:48:34.480 --> 3:48:39.040]  in charge of the executive branch and the whole game would have changed and we
[3:48:39.040 --> 3:48:43.560]  would have actually unraveled the deep state then we didn't have a chance
[3:48:43.560 --> 3:48:52.160]  because if you remember history Agnew was bounced and then Ford came in and
[3:48:52.160 --> 3:48:58.320]  then Nixon resigned Ford went up Ford pardon Nixon we never got the true
[3:48:58.320 --> 3:49:03.320]  story of Watergate and all the rest of it and the Nixon's henchmen all shut up
[3:49:03.320 --> 3:49:07.920]  and got light sentences a couple of years at most and off they went to write
[3:49:07.920 --> 3:49:13.880]  their books and retire from the deep state now when you think about what then
[3:49:13.880 --> 3:49:19.360]  happened is Ford then became president and behind him came Rockefeller the
[3:49:19.360 --> 3:49:23.560]  vice president many people forget this and then there was an attempt on Ford's
[3:49:23.560 --> 3:49:29.760]  life by squeaky from one of the old Manson zombies she missed and Ford stayed
[3:49:29.760 --> 3:49:33.560]  in but otherwise it would have been Rockefeller president United States which
[3:49:33.560 --> 3:49:41.280]  would have been a real weird upside-down kind of equation but nonetheless the
[3:49:41.280 --> 3:49:46.920]  history is is there and when I think about what could have happened because
[3:49:46.920 --> 3:49:51.160]  after that what happened is we had the church committee hearings which unleashed
[3:49:51.160 --> 3:49:56.400]  all of the FBI abuses the MK ultra programs in the last few days I've been
[3:49:56.400 --> 3:50:04.680]  reading the story of Sidney Gottlieb and his bio and his history who ran the MK
[3:50:04.680 --> 3:50:09.800]  ultra programs and all of the sub programs organized under it and when you
[3:50:09.800 --> 3:50:14.800]  look back on that history of what was being attempted and what eventually
[3:50:14.800 --> 3:50:20.680]  transpired was real abuses within the central intelligence things they had
[3:50:20.680 --> 3:50:25.240]  opened up two shops one in San Francisco and one in New York the one and they
[3:50:25.240 --> 3:50:31.720]  employed prostitutes the government employed prostitutes and then used
[3:50:31.720 --> 3:50:37.440]  LSD and other mind-altering drugs to see how people behave and whether they
[3:50:37.440 --> 3:50:42.920]  could keep intelligence secrets and so on and this was just part of it they were
[3:50:42.920 --> 3:50:48.480]  also working in Lexington Kentucky with the prisoners there they were working in
[3:50:48.480 --> 3:50:57.000]  Canada with the McGill Institute up there and I mean a lot of things were
[3:50:57.000 --> 3:51:01.440]  going on and they were infiltrating US community groups that they didn't like
[3:51:01.440 --> 3:51:06.080]  who were saying things they didn't like and creating new narratives for the
[3:51:06.080 --> 3:51:12.840]  public to buy into is what was going on and and if you remember Nixon and
[3:51:12.840 --> 3:51:17.800]  Kissinger had just opened up China and we see where that takes us now all these
[3:51:17.800 --> 3:51:23.440]  years later they had closed the gold window I mean a lot of things happen in
[3:51:23.440 --> 3:51:30.760]  the early 70s if you stop and think about it and history did not get the
[3:51:30.760 --> 3:51:37.000]  opportunity of the truth because there was no whistleblower mechanism and there
[3:51:37.000 --> 3:51:42.400]  was no massage and there was no internet and there was no way for the deep
[3:51:42.400 --> 3:51:47.880]  state to be undone and the best way for it to stay the way it was was what was
[3:51:47.880 --> 3:51:53.280]  sort of standard practice which is when you said too much and you weren't able
[3:51:53.280 --> 3:52:00.680]  to be manipulated and controlled you died even if you were a US congressman in
[3:52:00.680 --> 3:52:05.920]  the United States that was the depth of the deep state in the 70s and not much
[3:52:05.920 --> 3:52:11.680]  has changed I don't think I'm amazed at who's all still standing in the public
[3:52:11.680 --> 3:52:17.720]  arena and we'll see what the long run brings us as all of this moves moves
[3:52:17.720 --> 3:52:22.960]  forward but I think people need to remember what was happening then is
[3:52:22.960 --> 3:52:29.040]  happening now the lack of transparency and government particularly with
[3:52:29.040 --> 3:52:35.960]  security agencies who have now formed alliances with the tentacles of the
[3:52:35.960 --> 3:52:42.520]  deep state which is essentially media and our communication linkages that
[3:52:42.520 --> 3:52:47.280]  actually tie us all together and what's being created in this and unfortunately
[3:52:47.280 --> 3:52:50.720]  today we're not going to have enough time to get into it but when you think
[3:52:50.720 --> 3:52:55.480]  about this the narrative is actually the projection being created in the
[3:52:55.480 --> 3:53:01.400]  programming that's being laid into everyone's psyche at the moment I mean
[3:53:01.400 --> 3:53:06.920]  it's being done through media and through visual imaging that's now tied
[3:53:06.920 --> 3:53:12.520]  everyone together through their devices which are the biggest monitoring system
[3:53:12.520 --> 3:53:17.200]  ever envisioned by man operating on the planet today and something that we
[3:53:17.200 --> 3:53:24.520]  predicted over 25 years ago and now we see a played out 1984 on steroids
[3:53:24.520 --> 3:53:29.760]  penetrating every aspect of our personal privacy and liberty in a way that is
[3:53:29.760 --> 3:53:36.720]  just unfathomable and missing the value judgment discussion that needs to happen
[3:53:36.720 --> 3:53:43.520]  I mean a whole generation is missing it now there's some really awake and aware
[3:53:43.520 --> 3:53:47.920]  young people out there that are paying attention to this broadcast and others
[3:53:47.920 --> 3:53:53.520]  who understand the value system that allows us to function within this
[3:53:53.520 --> 3:53:59.680]  Democratic Republic and what is at risk today and it's that Republic that is at
[3:53:59.680 --> 3:54:04.600]  risk today in terms of our freedoms and our basic foundational liberties and
[3:54:04.600 --> 3:54:08.360]  here's something I want to remind people of a foundational thing that most
[3:54:08.360 --> 3:54:14.240]  people forget as we're trapped in the hamster wheel of the cubicle world of
[3:54:14.240 --> 3:54:19.680]  the 21st century is life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness are still
[3:54:19.680 --> 3:54:24.600]  admirable objectives and should form the basis of the way in which we function
[3:54:24.600 --> 3:54:29.960]  within our culture at least and what I would say along that line is that doesn't
[3:54:29.960 --> 3:54:34.080]  mean exploitation of each other quite the opposite means respect of the
[3:54:34.080 --> 3:54:39.280]  dignity of human beings something I talk about often and you know I got a
[3:54:39.280 --> 3:54:42.600]  couple good communications this last week from folks I want to remind people
[3:54:42.600 --> 3:54:47.600]  they can communicate with me through earthpulse.com and that's great if you
[3:54:47.600 --> 3:54:51.080]  do if you have something you want me to cover more in depth I appreciate that
[3:54:51.080 --> 3:54:55.280]  but one of the things someone pointed out was that you know we should try to
[3:54:55.280 --> 3:55:00.280]  come up with solutions beyond supporting the InfoWars store which keeps this
[3:55:00.280 --> 3:55:06.800]  network alive but things that we can do anyway that don't cost us economically
[3:55:06.800 --> 3:55:11.120]  because we realize there's times when we just can't do things on the economic
[3:55:11.120 --> 3:55:14.760]  arena but there's things we can do to change the world and this is my main
[3:55:14.760 --> 3:55:20.600]  message these days the most important message that I speak to these days is
[3:55:20.600 --> 3:55:26.800]  this one is it's about the power of the individual the individual soul you and
[3:55:26.800 --> 3:55:31.880]  me and what we can do in the world together if we execute against what we
[3:55:31.880 --> 3:55:37.200]  believe is right and true and take an action not talking about some radical
[3:55:37.200 --> 3:55:41.480]  crazy dangerous action I'm talking a positive affirmative action that we
[3:55:41.480 --> 3:55:46.760]  know we can achieve and succeed at that's going to add cumulatively add to the
[3:55:46.760 --> 3:55:50.440]  changes we want to see projected in the world because that's how the other side
[3:55:50.440 --> 3:55:56.080]  does it and they do it by controlling media the power behind the InfoWars is
[3:55:56.080 --> 3:56:01.040]  when you combine intellect with heart the left and bright right brain come
[3:56:01.040 --> 3:56:06.320]  together in what is the most creative force on the planet human awareness and
[3:56:06.320 --> 3:56:11.640]  consciousness focused emotionally and intellectually towards change that's what
[3:56:11.640 --> 3:56:15.640]  changes the world in the 21st century that's what's going to change the world
