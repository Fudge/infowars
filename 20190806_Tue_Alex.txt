[00:00.000 --> 00:09.320]  Red Alert, Red Alert, Red Alert, World War 4 Has Begun, World War 4 Has Begun, a different
[00:09.320 --> 00:10.320]  type of war.
[00:10.320 --> 00:11.320]  But it has begun.
[00:11.320 --> 00:15.040]  India has invaded Kashmir in a proxy war for the U.S. against China.
[00:15.040 --> 00:17.600]  Red Alert, but first, this report.
[00:17.600 --> 00:22.360]  The following video shows transparency in our justice system.
[00:22.360 --> 00:23.360]  Thank you, Mayor.
[00:23.360 --> 00:27.720]  So I'm here to provide an update for which you are well aware as an active shooter that
[00:27.720 --> 00:32.920]  occurred in the Oregon District in the early morning hours of today.
[00:32.920 --> 00:39.560]  The suspect has been identified as a Connor Stephen Betts, is a minimal criminal history
[00:39.560 --> 00:45.920]  as an adult, his traffic violations, speed failure control and failure to yield.
[00:45.920 --> 00:51.200]  He was wearing a mask, a bulletproof vest in hearing protection.
[00:51.200 --> 00:58.560]  He was armed with a.223 caliber-like rifle with 100 round drum magazines.
[00:58.560 --> 01:02.920]  He is a 24 years of age and he is deceased.
[01:02.920 --> 01:08.480]  These are outside of Ned Peppers, a police officer running on the top of the screen to
[01:08.480 --> 01:10.640]  engage the suspect.
[01:10.640 --> 01:16.200]  See the suspect entered the bottom right-hand corner of the screen, that's him there entering
[01:16.200 --> 01:22.440]  for Tempe Internet Peppers when he has struck multiple times, and he stops there.
[01:22.440 --> 01:27.400]  You see a lot of officers who are entering in from the upper left-hand corner of the
[01:27.400 --> 01:43.880]  screen and beginning heading down the roadway there to engage the suspect.
[01:43.880 --> 01:55.680]  There's one officer there, another officer coming, the patrol rifle, additional officers
[01:55.680 --> 02:02.960]  responding, officer with a sergeant with a shotgun.
[02:02.960 --> 02:07.320]  The Dayton Police Department was forthcoming enough to show us the surveillance video of
[02:07.320 --> 02:09.160]  the perpetrator.
[02:09.160 --> 02:14.080]  This is what the American people deserve in a so-called free society.
[02:14.080 --> 02:19.600]  In stark contrast to this, we were shown very little in El Paso, Texas.
[02:19.600 --> 02:26.000]  The El Paso Police Department reported multiple reports of multiple shooters.
[02:26.000 --> 02:31.440]  The El Paso Mayor reported three suspects in custody.
[02:31.440 --> 02:35.160]  One eyewitness claimed the shooter was wearing all black and had a mask on.
[02:35.160 --> 03:03.800]  Another eyewitness claimed seeing three to four shooters.
[03:03.800 --> 03:13.320]  An Anna Giara Telly, Homeland Security reporter for the Washington Examiner, claimed the law
[03:13.320 --> 03:19.120]  enforcement source in El Paso told her a second suspect was killed when the police responded
[03:19.120 --> 03:21.960]  to the Walmart shooting.
[03:21.960 --> 03:28.680]  But within hours, without any investigation, we were shown only still images of the Walmart
[03:28.680 --> 03:34.960]  surveillance video, an arrest made blocks away from the crime scene, and a snapshot
[03:34.960 --> 03:39.600]  taken by police sergeant Cardenas.
[03:39.600 --> 03:44.760]  We were told within hours that Patrick Crucius acted alone.
[03:44.760 --> 03:51.480]  His supposed manifesto was uploaded to the internet the same morning, and his MyLife
[03:51.480 --> 03:57.600]  social media page was altered the same day to change him from a registered Democrat to
[03:57.600 --> 04:00.520]  a registered Republican.
[04:00.520 --> 04:06.940]  There seems to be no investigation, and yet the FBI is now assisting the El Paso Police
[04:06.940 --> 04:08.440]  Department.
[04:08.440 --> 04:10.480]  Why?
[04:10.480 --> 04:14.400]  Only a fool would accept this as justice.
[04:14.400 --> 04:18.960]  The transparency demonstrated by the Dayton Police when they released the surveillance
[04:18.960 --> 04:25.200]  video is exactly the sort of justice we should expect from our law enforcement.
[04:25.200 --> 04:30.760]  Will the FBI release the Walmart surveillance video, putting all these claims of multiple
[04:30.760 --> 04:37.640]  shears to rest, or will it be another Las Vegas?
[04:37.640 --> 05:00.240]  For Infowars.com, this is Greg Rees.
[05:00.240 --> 05:04.400]  The globalists are hyper competitive scientific dictators.
[05:04.400 --> 05:08.720]  They are technocrats, they are control freaks in their own words, and they believe allowing
[05:08.720 --> 05:13.400]  you to live your own life and make your own decisions gets to the way of their great destiny
[05:13.400 --> 05:14.800]  to merge with AI gods.
[05:14.800 --> 05:18.440]  Now we're fighting them hard in cyberspace, we're fighting them hard right here in the
[05:18.440 --> 05:22.960]  third dimension, but one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really
[05:22.960 --> 05:25.920]  got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[05:25.920 --> 05:31.200]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements for Infowars.com, I couldn't do it.
[05:31.200 --> 05:35.560]  That's why we decided to take our original Secret 12 that was incredibly high quality
[05:35.560 --> 05:41.280]  Methylcobalamin and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.
[05:41.280 --> 05:46.160]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12 over the counter that you're going
[05:46.160 --> 05:47.160]  to find anywhere.
[05:47.160 --> 05:52.320]  It is amazing, experience pure Methylcobalamin B12 for yourself and fund the second American
[05:52.320 --> 06:17.840]  Revolution against the tyrants at infowarsstore.com, infowarslife.com, or AAA-253-3139.
[06:22.320 --> 06:51.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is not a stunt to build up the tension, the suspense.
[06:51.480 --> 06:58.280]  It's because what I'm going to lay out is so important that I'm choking and I've been
[06:58.280 --> 07:03.600]  on here 25 years, I don't choke in front of crowds of 10,000 people or on national television.
[07:03.600 --> 07:13.040]  But this is so big that I actually can't even talk about it because all the dominoes are
[07:13.040 --> 07:19.840]  falling in line, I can see exactly where this is going and as soon as I discovered this
[07:19.840 --> 07:27.200]  yesterday when I got off air, I did, I don't want to exaggerate, four hours of research
[07:27.200 --> 07:35.520]  last night, another hour of research this morning and the suspense is so intense of
[07:35.520 --> 07:41.080]  what we're going into and we've all talked about this feeling we have and this dread
[07:41.080 --> 07:47.000]  or this mix with energy and just the feeling of war is what I described yesterday on Air
[07:47.000 --> 07:48.000]  with Salente.
[07:48.000 --> 08:00.240]  Salente, I feel war, I feel something big is happening all over the world and it's like
[08:00.240 --> 08:04.840]  a lot of people before you go into battle, even back in the old days, they weren't cowards
[08:04.840 --> 08:07.520]  lining up pulling their swords out all about to kill each other, people start throwing
[08:07.520 --> 08:11.640]  up because you're just getting everything out of your stomach so that all the blood
[08:11.640 --> 08:23.040]  can go to your body for the fight and that's the grist level, grit level, visceral feeling
[08:23.040 --> 08:32.800]  of this is I want to go throw up and then I'm ready to fight, I'm ready to kick ass
[08:32.800 --> 08:41.000]  right now, I'm ready to tear people's heads off, that's the genetic lower brain understanding
[08:41.000 --> 08:45.240]  what the higher brain sees and getting itself geared up, that doesn't mean I'm going to
[08:45.240 --> 08:49.400]  go out and be violent but imagine people that aren't operating at a high level, they can
[08:49.400 --> 08:54.520]  feel the tension in the world, they can feel the newborn babies being kept alive and tortured
[08:54.520 --> 08:59.600]  to death and their organs taken, your spirit knows about the human animal clones and the
[08:59.600 --> 09:05.080]  abomination, your spirit knows the devil worshipers are kidnapping children, your spirit knows
[09:05.080 --> 09:10.080]  that the Chinese have millions in death camps and so the globalists then misdirect your
[09:10.080 --> 09:17.040]  brain and say it's Trump, he's the Nazi, he's killing children and people feel the evil,
[09:17.040 --> 09:23.000]  everybody's psychic but if you're not conscious of that it's misdirected then on to the American
[09:23.000 --> 09:33.640]  people, it's misdirected on to each other because people feel the anxiety, they see it, you
[09:33.640 --> 09:41.600]  cut it with a knife, everybody's talking about it and it's because World War IV has begun
[09:41.600 --> 09:47.920]  and Harrison Smith this morning, I was watching the show, he was sitting in for David 90's
[09:47.920 --> 09:55.160]  on a well-deserved vacation and he made just some incredible points that add to all of
[09:55.160 --> 10:03.040]  this that I'm going to really try the best I can to cover at the bottom of the hour but
[10:03.040 --> 10:10.680]  I need some time to actually get my research together and talk about this because I'm too
[10:10.680 --> 10:15.440]  prepared, it's basically how I describe it, I was too prepared yesterday when I came in
[10:15.440 --> 10:20.760]  for the show as well, but if you're not freaked out about what's going on, it's like being
[10:20.760 --> 10:29.400]  a surgeon that's about to do a super dangerous surgery like separating two Siamese twins,
[10:29.400 --> 10:35.440]  you make a wrong move, one or both will die and a lot of people just can't handle this
[10:35.440 --> 10:40.640]  tension, there's seven and a half billion souls, we all have a sixth sense, we all have
[10:40.640 --> 10:47.720]  a spirit, we all have a interdimensional internet and the enemy knows this and is trying to
[10:47.720 --> 10:53.680]  jack in and manipulate us in mass to control not just our ability to build whatever we
[10:53.680 --> 11:00.400]  envision but to envision whatever we want which then builds whatever we want, we are
[11:00.400 --> 11:11.680]  little G image of God, it's all right there, we are super computer super weapons, we are
[11:11.680 --> 11:17.000]  in embryonic phase right now and we're being jacked and being attempted to be turned into
[11:17.000 --> 11:23.760]  an off-world colonization weapon system instead of what our real mission is going to be.
[11:23.760 --> 11:28.320]  By the way, I told you all this 20 years ago, the globalists now tell you this, the New
[11:28.320 --> 11:33.040]  York Times tells you this, they just admit it all, they've come out in the Smithsonian
[11:33.040 --> 11:39.400]  Institute and admitted that they're chemtrailing, they say well one thing is to put barium salt
[11:39.400 --> 11:44.360]  salem dioxide in the jet fuel so jet liners can help protect the earth even while they
[11:44.360 --> 11:51.520]  add carbon to it, oh that's the Nobel Prize 1992, went global in 1996 but everybody's
[11:51.520 --> 11:57.520]  a cook talks about chemtrails but oh it's all true, all admitted Smithsonian, oh and
[11:57.520 --> 12:01.720]  Bill Gates is running it, I told you Bill Gates was running it 20 years ago, I specifically
[12:01.720 --> 12:15.320]  said Bill Gates is the chief science officer of the New World Order, John P. Holdren, this
[12:15.320 --> 12:25.320]  is deputy, he was chief science officer for Obama, Bill Gates is the chief science officer,
[12:25.320 --> 12:33.160]  he runs the whole damn thing, by the way he's got some vaccines he wants you to take and
[12:33.160 --> 12:39.120]  you're not going to be worried about stuff anymore, nanoviruses that destroy parts of
[12:39.120 --> 12:46.720]  the brain associated with higher consciousness that can be registered and read by a computer,
[12:46.720 --> 12:55.640]  Bill Gates doesn't want you to have that, what a nice person, very mailed, he'll carry
[12:55.640 --> 13:00.800]  out the mission, those gleaming eyes of a total predator and when he goes and gives
[13:00.800 --> 13:06.280]  little Africans their polio shots he'll, all the photos of his dad, the kids in foreign
[13:06.280 --> 13:27.240]  countries hugging them, concealed in his fortress, the eye sees all pierces, even flesh, an eye
[13:27.240 --> 13:49.520]  breathed in flame, you know of which I speak, when I come back I'm going to get into their
[13:49.520 --> 13:55.120]  psychic manipulation going on right now with this operation they carried out in El Paso
[13:55.120 --> 14:06.560]  that reeks of being synthetic and in the copycatter, the revenge hit up in Dayton Ohio by an Antifa
[14:06.560 --> 14:15.120]  member, AP had to admit that this morning, they're a little upset, that's all coming
[14:15.120 --> 14:25.600]  up but World War 4, what does World War 4 look like, we'll break down World War 4 at
[14:25.600 --> 14:31.320]  the bottom of the hour, now we're going to go to break here, I just want to encourage
[14:31.320 --> 14:36.360]  the listeners and I want to ask the listeners to think about the world we live in and think
[14:36.360 --> 14:46.040]  about the things that are happening and think about what's unfolding and understand that
[14:46.040 --> 14:52.120]  without you funding us we're not going to be here and all I want is a pro-human future
[14:52.120 --> 14:59.400]  and to protect the children and to go to the next level, all I want is everything, you
[14:59.400 --> 15:05.640]  see we're going to get everything, eyes not seen, ear has not heard, you can't even imagine,
[15:05.640 --> 15:12.920]  I know I couldn't but I've seen a lot and I think you've seen a lot too, haven't you,
[15:12.920 --> 15:20.240]  I've seen beyond the veil and the enemy can't stand that, we're literally inside their heads,
[15:20.240 --> 15:27.000]  they had to cut that part of themselves off to rule on the planet with their master, Satan,
[15:27.000 --> 15:37.840]  Lucifer, the devil, the old serpent, the loser, the failure, the bird that lands in the nest
[15:37.840 --> 15:44.440]  and kicks the eggs out and lays its own eggs, then finds out it can't even lay eggs, but
[15:44.440 --> 15:52.640]  still better let the eggs be broken below as the bird looks over the edge, did the bird
[15:52.640 --> 15:59.320]  hear something above it, coming down and its time is over.
[15:59.320 --> 16:04.560]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners, if you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival
[16:04.560 --> 16:08.800]  backup system that we're waiting for prices too crazy to pass up, this will be the most
[16:08.800 --> 16:10.640]  important message you'll ever hear.
[16:10.640 --> 16:14.480]  Bill Hyde here and I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on
[16:14.480 --> 16:19.080]  our PPX microgrid system that's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity
[16:19.080 --> 16:20.080]  off the grid.
[16:20.080 --> 16:24.000]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the east
[16:24.000 --> 16:25.480]  bank of the Mississippi.
[16:25.480 --> 16:29.280]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location
[16:29.280 --> 16:33.040]  and rather than move it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price
[16:33.040 --> 16:37.400]  that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory.
[16:37.400 --> 16:43.040]  So here's what you should do right now, check out the PPX microgrid system at myownpowergrid.com,
[16:43.040 --> 16:48.400]  that's myownpowergrid.com, over a thousand dollars in great off the grid gear and a ton
[16:48.400 --> 16:49.400]  of bonuses too.
[16:49.400 --> 16:53.680]  For the best part, you're not going to pay 750 or 500 dollars, 300 or even 200.
[16:53.680 --> 16:59.320]  Go to myownpowergrid.com to learn more, that's myownpowergrid.com.
[16:59.320 --> 17:04.320]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels
[17:04.320 --> 17:09.880]  may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there, loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes
[17:09.880 --> 17:14.400]  and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can
[17:14.400 --> 17:16.520]  alert you that something is wrong.
[17:16.520 --> 17:21.040]  Remember how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives
[17:21.040 --> 17:22.040]  across America.
[17:22.040 --> 17:25.920]  My blood pressure has normalized, my diabetes has totally improved.
[17:25.920 --> 17:29.600]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much
[17:29.600 --> 17:33.240]  healthier I feel, I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[17:33.240 --> 17:38.440]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative
[17:38.440 --> 17:40.920]  to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[17:40.920 --> 17:49.120]  Remember your two month supply today by calling 866-295-5305 that's 866-295-5305 or order
[17:49.120 --> 18:01.320]  online hbextract.com, heart and body extract 866-295-5305 or hbextract.com.
[18:01.320 --> 18:08.680]  What you have witnessed is the biggest development in free speech in the western world history.
[18:08.680 --> 18:22.320]  This is a digital, AI-enforced gag order not to say the name Alex Jones or infowars.com.
[18:22.320 --> 18:28.040]  This is Nazi Germany level, this is racketeering, this is cartels, Mr. President we need your
[18:28.040 --> 18:32.280]  help, we need it now, you can take on big tech.
[18:32.280 --> 18:39.640]  They saw infowars as a dominant, independent, anti-war, pro-human, pro-sovereign, pro-family,
[18:39.640 --> 18:41.240]  populist organization.
[18:41.240 --> 18:46.280]  So they thought first they come for Alex Jones, then when people say okay take him off the
[18:46.280 --> 18:49.000]  air everyone else like dominoes would fall.
[18:49.000 --> 18:54.120]  The way to fight back is to support infowars now more than ever and make it a standard
[18:54.120 --> 18:58.120]  of freedom and free speech, understand that they believe they can take us down, they'll
[18:58.120 --> 19:00.280]  take everybody else down.
[19:00.280 --> 19:05.640]  Before I started working at infowars I was not only a fan of Alex Jones and infowars.com
[19:05.640 --> 19:10.240]  but also the products at infowarsstore.com and there's one product that's offered at
[19:10.240 --> 19:15.640]  infowarsstore.com that is the elite of the supplements and that's DNA Force Plus.
[19:15.640 --> 19:19.680]  Now I remember when Alex first started talking about this with some of his special guests,
[19:19.680 --> 19:23.440]  telomeres and telomere support with your DNA.
[19:23.440 --> 19:28.320]  So I started to look into the science and what telomeres were and how it can improve
[19:28.320 --> 19:31.840]  your health and longevity when you protect your telomeres.
[19:31.840 --> 19:35.760]  So I started looking into DNA Force Plus but it's expensive, why?
[19:35.760 --> 19:40.640]  Because it is an elite supplement and then I started seeing other competitors coming
[19:40.640 --> 19:45.680]  up with competitive supplements for telomere support and they came and they went.
[19:45.680 --> 19:48.680]  But DNA Force Plus is still there.
[19:48.680 --> 19:50.160]  It is the elite supplement.
[19:50.160 --> 19:54.960]  I get excited when DNA Force Plus is on sale because I know it's expensive so you should
[19:54.960 --> 19:59.600]  take advantage of 50% off DNA Force Plus at infowarsstore.com.
[20:24.960 --> 20:43.720]  I think the president has to bear some responsibility for creating a culture in the United States
[20:43.720 --> 20:49.960]  around race baiting, around demonizing people of color, about around demonizing immigrants.
[20:49.960 --> 20:54.120]  We have a president of the United States who has embraced white nationalism.
[20:54.120 --> 20:58.280]  And now America is under attack from domestic white nationalist terror.
[20:58.280 --> 21:03.200]  White nationalist, white supremacist, racist hatred, white nationalism and white nationalist
[21:03.200 --> 21:04.200]  violence.
[21:04.200 --> 21:05.560]  White nationalist terrorism.
[21:05.560 --> 21:06.560]  White nationalist.
[21:06.560 --> 21:07.560]  White nationalist.
[21:07.560 --> 21:08.560]  White nationalism.
[21:08.560 --> 21:09.560]  White nationalist.
[21:09.560 --> 21:11.840]  The president has stoked the flames.
[21:11.840 --> 21:18.800]  He has emboldened it, he has given it power, he has elevated it, he has coddled it and
[21:18.800 --> 21:20.160]  he's got to stop.
[21:20.160 --> 21:24.000]  This is the environment that the president has created, he's made it okay.
[21:24.000 --> 21:33.040]  He is responsible for what is going on and is doing nothing, nothing to stop the carnage
[21:33.040 --> 21:34.040]  and the chaos.
[21:34.040 --> 21:39.680]  I'm incredibly saddened and it's very hard to think about this.
[21:39.680 --> 21:47.440]  Our president right now is using the same language of racism, of bigotry and white supremacy.
[21:47.440 --> 21:48.440]  He is a racist.
[21:48.440 --> 21:52.960]  Donald Trump talks like a racist, thinks like a racist, makes statements like a racist.
[21:52.960 --> 21:56.520]  Yeah, he's a racist because racism is as racism does.
[21:56.520 --> 21:58.520]  He must be held responsible.
[21:58.520 --> 22:00.160]  It's a national embarrassment.
[22:00.160 --> 22:05.800]  I mean, who cares how strong our economy is or how strong our military is if Americans
[22:05.800 --> 22:06.960]  are killing Americans.
[22:06.960 --> 22:22.840]  When you read that manifesto, it looked like it could have been written by a Trump speechwriter.
[22:22.840 --> 22:30.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, you know what it means that India just took over Kashmir and just
[22:30.120 --> 22:36.360]  threw the Pakistan and Chinese puppet governors out?
[22:36.360 --> 22:44.120]  It means the original world order system at the end of World War II is being overturned.
[22:44.120 --> 22:54.840]  Now I knew that the minute I got off here and went to infowars.com to see any updates
[22:54.840 --> 23:02.440]  and there was just a little blurb, oh, India has ended the autonomous rule agreement of
[23:02.440 --> 23:06.320]  1949 and I went what?
[23:06.320 --> 23:07.480]  Because I know the way the land there.
[23:07.480 --> 23:09.000]  I've studied it because it's one of the major flash points.
[23:09.000 --> 23:10.520]  It's also very interesting history.
[23:10.520 --> 23:14.960]  I read books about the great game, the British Empire, how they play different groups off
[23:14.960 --> 23:23.080]  against each other and as soon as I went and read the articles, it was, oh, they arrested
[23:23.080 --> 23:28.000]  and took over and cut the internet and cut the power in government districts and there's
[23:28.000 --> 23:32.160]  been some shots fired and some things happening, no big deal.
[23:32.160 --> 23:37.840]  The Indians were screwed over in 49 and had the birthplace of India and the birthplace
[23:37.840 --> 23:45.280]  of the culture taken by the Muslims who remember Muslims didn't exist until 1400 years ago
[23:45.280 --> 23:50.960]  and India used to spread all the way to the edge of Iran and then into China, into Mongolia.
[23:50.960 --> 23:53.040]  You can pull up the ancient map of India.
[23:53.040 --> 23:59.040]  It was a huge empire but the Muslims shrunk it down to what it is today and said and we'll
[23:59.040 --> 24:04.840]  take the whole top of your country and we'll take some of this and we'll take some of that.
[24:04.840 --> 24:11.720]  140 million Hindus killed by Muslims in the last thousand years, conservative number, 140
[24:11.720 --> 24:12.720]  million.
[24:12.720 --> 24:18.040]  Kind of like Europe held out against the Muslim invasions.
[24:18.040 --> 24:19.720]  Constantinople didn't hold out too good.
[24:19.720 --> 24:26.240]  It's called Turkey today but this is a big deal and this is a proxy war.
[24:26.240 --> 24:29.920]  The next segment I'm going to get into it because it's not just this domino.
[24:29.920 --> 24:33.640]  I know that most folks cashmere might as well be Mars.
[24:33.640 --> 24:38.360]  Now, this is on our doorstep and this is Trump.
[24:38.360 --> 24:49.560]  That pull up for the next segment video of the Indian Prime Minister hugging Trump.
[24:49.560 --> 24:53.760]  That was like the second guy Trump met with was the Indian Prime Minister and remember
[24:53.760 --> 24:55.600]  he was hugging and wouldn't quit hugging.
[24:55.600 --> 24:56.600]  He never does this.
[24:56.600 --> 25:03.360]  He never just hugs people like this because he just agreed to let India off the chain
[25:03.360 --> 25:09.880]  that they've been under with the UN since 49.
[25:09.880 --> 25:13.400]  Everybody knows Trump keeps his promises.
[25:13.400 --> 25:17.920]  So China thinks they're going to attack Taiwan and other areas.
[25:17.920 --> 25:27.920]  Oh, how you like the Indian military rolling in and Chinese officials, you know, are falling
[25:27.920 --> 25:31.280]  down and breaking their necks and so are the Pakistani officials.
[25:31.280 --> 25:34.120]  It's on, folks.
[25:34.120 --> 25:35.120]  They came in.
[25:35.120 --> 25:36.120]  They've been invading.
[25:36.120 --> 25:37.120]  They've been taking it over.
[25:37.120 --> 25:41.840]  They've now been moving against the next border with India wanting more of India.
[25:41.840 --> 25:45.440]  And the Indians are just like, we're not putting up with this anymore.
[25:45.440 --> 25:50.120]  But the leftist globalist media sits on top of the Indians.
[25:50.120 --> 25:52.840]  Just like here they go, you're Hindu extremist.
[25:52.840 --> 25:55.320]  You're Hindu supremist.
[25:55.320 --> 26:02.040]  Oh, the main threat in Central Asia is Indian extremist.
[26:02.040 --> 26:03.280]  Oh, yes.
[26:03.280 --> 26:06.160]  They're just always hijacking planes and bombing people.
[26:06.160 --> 26:08.240]  No, they're fighting back.
[26:08.240 --> 26:12.720]  They're the ones under attack.
[26:12.720 --> 26:18.760]  And a thousand-year war that India's had to fight for its life against Islam is now in
[26:18.760 --> 26:20.480]  a proxy against China.
[26:20.480 --> 26:23.000]  And that goes into the currency war and the stock market and everything.
[26:23.000 --> 26:26.320]  It's all part of World War IV.
[26:26.320 --> 26:31.520]  So again, I cannot state to you how huge or how massive or how insane or how crazy all
[26:31.520 --> 26:32.800]  of this is.
[26:32.800 --> 26:33.800]  This is so big.
[26:33.800 --> 26:35.000]  Guys, I had my plug sheet in here.
[26:35.000 --> 26:36.600]  I don't know if I lost it.
[26:36.600 --> 26:37.600]  Oh, here it is.
[26:37.600 --> 26:44.280]  Let me spend some time on this, though, or we won't be here.
[26:44.280 --> 26:47.360]  We sell really high-quality products.
[26:47.360 --> 26:51.160]  Our coffee, I think it's the best coffee I ever had.
[26:51.160 --> 26:53.400]  These knobs drink it, and they go, why the hell is this so good?
[26:53.400 --> 26:55.400]  Well, it's hand-picked.
[26:55.400 --> 26:59.920]  It's a wild, wild harvested.
[26:59.920 --> 27:00.920]  That's even better than organic.
[27:00.920 --> 27:02.480]  It's the level above that.
[27:02.480 --> 27:09.280]  In Chiapas, in the mountains, on the border of Guatemala, and I drank a lot of coffees,
[27:09.280 --> 27:15.200]  and I used to get this coffee out of Whole Foods, the same stuff, and then I found out
[27:15.200 --> 27:19.200]  who brings it into the U.S. and I made a deal with them, and I went and I private-labeled
[27:19.200 --> 27:26.320]  and it's $5 to $10 a pound less than the exact same stuff sold at Whole Foods.
[27:26.320 --> 27:30.960]  That's what it is, and it's been year after year one of their highest-rated coffees in
[27:30.960 --> 27:31.960]  the country.
[27:31.960 --> 27:32.960]  That's what it is.
[27:32.960 --> 27:35.160]  So, just like all my supplements are the same thing.
[27:35.160 --> 27:38.920]  I go and find out what's the highest-best-rated thing that everybody loves that I can get
[27:38.920 --> 27:45.520]  a lot of, and then the left found out I was doing it and got upset and got mad and actually
[27:45.520 --> 27:51.200]  tried to get the Chiapas communes, they're actually real communists, but they share everything
[27:51.200 --> 27:52.200]  communally.
[27:52.200 --> 27:53.200]  It's not the globalist communism.
[27:53.200 --> 27:55.200]  I'm not defending it either.
[27:55.200 --> 28:03.080]  It's a classical farming commune, and I lost the distributor because I was mad at Obama
[28:03.080 --> 28:06.520]  and they didn't like criticizing Obama and they thought I was buying truckloads of this
[28:06.520 --> 28:14.680]  a month, and guess what, I just got another contact with the exact same group and the
[28:14.680 --> 28:16.240]  coffee was even better.
[28:16.240 --> 28:22.760]  It turns out that I was getting, not the dregs, but I was not getting the highest-rated.
[28:22.760 --> 28:27.600]  So people still loved it, but we got even better.
[28:27.600 --> 28:28.600]  Even better.
[28:28.600 --> 28:30.600]  So, it's like that for all the supplements.
[28:30.600 --> 28:33.600]  They all have that similar type of stories that wake up America coffee.
[28:33.600 --> 28:38.800]  We also have it with the Ricci mushrooms for immune support, two different types, and it's
[28:38.800 --> 28:42.000]  an infowarstore.com, and it's all massively discounted.
[28:42.000 --> 28:51.080]  It has a 98% review rate right there, 100%, medium-rose baby, infowarstore.com.
[28:51.080 --> 28:52.080]  We have huge sales.
[28:52.080 --> 28:54.760]  This is one year to go today, but we got the platform.
[28:54.760 --> 28:55.760]  Remember that?
[28:55.760 --> 28:58.760]  Let's see what it is.
[28:58.760 --> 29:03.360]  Finally, there's a way for you to get into the blockchain, the hottest financial sector
[29:03.360 --> 29:05.240]  without all the speculation.
[29:05.240 --> 29:10.400]  No, enjoy a 27% annualized payment each month without the ups and downs of Bitcoin.
[29:10.400 --> 29:14.720]  Lean on programs broadcast on Fox Business News, blockchain data centers offer an equipment
[29:14.720 --> 29:18.080]  leasing program in the explosive digital asset marketplace.
[29:18.080 --> 29:21.920]  Inspired by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels during the gold rush, the money is
[29:21.920 --> 29:26.040]  in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets.
[29:26.040 --> 29:30.560]  Not a security IPO or note, blockchain data centers have a proven turnkey equipment sale
[29:30.560 --> 29:36.760]  leaseback program with a 27% annualized lease payment deposited into your bank account each
[29:36.760 --> 29:37.760]  month.
[29:37.760 --> 29:38.760]  Don't miss this one.
[29:38.760 --> 29:45.480]  Call 800-600-3388, that's 800-600-3388.
[29:45.480 --> 29:47.600]  These valuable lease contracts won't last long.
[29:47.600 --> 29:52.960]  Call now 800-600-3388, 800-600-3388.
[29:52.960 --> 29:55.360]  Equipment offer poses a financial risk to owners consult with financial professionals
[29:55.360 --> 29:56.360]  before purchasing.
[29:56.360 --> 29:59.360]  Not an offer to buy or sell a security, which requires an offering document.
[29:59.360 --> 30:00.360]  Alex.
[30:00.360 --> 30:01.360]  Yes?
[30:01.360 --> 30:03.560]  I got a plug for the Patriot points I get.
[30:03.560 --> 30:04.560]  Oh, thanks.
[30:04.560 --> 30:07.600]  I got $180 so far this year, and I feel like I'm stealing from you.
[30:07.600 --> 30:10.760]  I buy so much in the store because, I mean, I don't want to give that money to Walmart.
[30:10.760 --> 30:13.440]  I don't want to give that money to people who are going to donate it to causes I don't
[30:13.440 --> 30:14.440]  believe in.
[30:14.440 --> 30:15.440]  So I'd rather give that money to you.
[30:15.440 --> 30:16.440]  And I'm getting quality products.
[30:16.440 --> 30:19.200]  The products that I do receive have changed my life.
[30:19.200 --> 30:21.440]  I mean, the X2 has really done a lot for me.
[30:21.440 --> 30:22.440]  I've lost weight.
[30:22.440 --> 30:24.000]  My brain works a whole lot better.
[30:24.000 --> 30:25.840]  My kids, they use the toothpaste.
[30:25.840 --> 30:30.040]  My son used to get these little sore throats, and he puts X2 in water and drinks it, and
[30:30.040 --> 30:31.040]  it gets rid of his sore throat.
[30:31.040 --> 30:33.040]  Well, sir, let me break this down for you.
[30:33.040 --> 30:34.520]  I want high quality stuff in there.
[30:34.520 --> 30:35.520]  I want a good price.
[30:35.520 --> 30:39.720]  But I've kind of habituated everybody to where everybody buys when it's 50% off.
[30:39.720 --> 30:42.120]  I'm making $2 on the toothpaste, 50% off.
[30:42.120 --> 30:45.760]  And so it's the same thing like the fish oil or the turmeric or the bone broth.
[30:45.760 --> 30:46.760]  Thank you so much for the plugs.
[30:46.760 --> 30:50.720]  But listen, when people get the Patriot points, a lot of times it makes things a loss leader
[30:50.720 --> 30:54.680]  because if you're already getting 10% off because you're on auto-ship, then we're doing
[30:54.680 --> 30:55.680]  50% off.
[30:55.680 --> 30:58.640]  And then you do something like that, where you have Patriot points, we lose money, but
[30:58.640 --> 30:59.640]  that's okay.
[30:59.640 --> 31:00.640]  Thanks for the support.
[31:00.640 --> 31:05.320]  Before I started working at Info Wars, I was not only a fan of Alex Jones and Info
[31:05.320 --> 31:08.400]  Wars.com, but also the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[31:08.400 --> 31:13.480]  And there's one product that's offered at InfoWarsStore.com that is the elite of the
[31:13.480 --> 31:15.880]  supplements and that's DNA Force Plus.
[31:15.880 --> 31:19.880]  Now I remember when Alex first started talking about this with some of his special guests,
[31:19.880 --> 31:23.640]  Telemyrs and Telemyr support with your DNA.
[31:23.640 --> 31:28.560]  So I started to look into the science and what Telemyrs were and how it can improve
[31:28.560 --> 31:32.080]  your health and longevity when you protect your Telemyrs.
[31:32.080 --> 31:35.520]  So I started looking into DNA Force Plus, but it's expensive.
[31:35.520 --> 31:36.520]  Why?
[31:36.520 --> 31:38.640]  Because it is an elite supplement.
[31:38.640 --> 31:42.600]  And then I started seeing other competitors coming up with competitive supplements for
[31:42.600 --> 31:48.920]  Telemyrs support and they came and they went, but DNA Force Plus is still there.
[31:48.920 --> 31:50.400]  It is the elite supplement.
[31:50.400 --> 31:54.280]  I get excited when DNA Force Plus is on sale because I know it's expensive.
[31:54.280 --> 32:02.400]  So you should take advantage of 50% off DNA Force Plus at InfoWarsStore.com.
[32:02.400 --> 32:07.160]  It's never been easy to figure out the essentials of a new supplement routine.
[32:07.160 --> 32:11.800]  That's why we created the 8-Pack PowerStack, your go-to option for the building blocks
[32:11.800 --> 32:14.800]  of a successful approach to supplementation.

[32:26.640 --> 32:30.280]  counter or 20-minute morning habits.

[32:34.840 --> 32:39.040]  conveniently accessible formulas to help you reach your peak without the deep supplement
[32:39.040 --> 32:44.960]  knowledge, stacks of bottles, and complicated routine, featuring eight different formulas
[32:44.960 --> 32:48.040]  for a total take on your health and wellness.

[32:58.640 --> 33:03.480]  routine.
[33:03.480 --> 33:24.280]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:24.280 --> 33:43.320]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[33:43.320 --> 33:51.120]  I always ask myself, why would the United States turn over all its power, its economic, its
[33:51.120 --> 33:57.800]  cultural, its military power, to a private, world corporate government set up by the remnants
[33:57.800 --> 33:59.560]  of the British Empire?
[33:59.560 --> 34:05.680]  I mean, Cecil Rhodes wrote about this, Winston Churchill wrote about this, wrote three volumes
[34:05.680 --> 34:16.680]  set on it, the history of the English-speaking peoples, and the re-merger with our American
[34:16.680 --> 34:20.920]  cousins as he called them.
[34:20.920 --> 34:32.120]  He of course was British royal, but one of his parents was an American, Robert Barron.
[34:32.120 --> 34:39.320]  And so the British Empire set up Pratt House, Royalists of International Affairs, Satellite,
[34:39.320 --> 34:47.720]  and created the Council on Foreign Relations to move America into the British Empire.
[34:47.720 --> 34:53.240]  Now understand, this is not an anglophile organization.
[34:53.240 --> 35:00.400]  It is the remnants of the Italian Black nobility, as they were known, from the city-states,
[35:00.400 --> 35:09.600]  the remnants of the old Holy Roman Empire, and of course the Romanians, the Hungarians,
[35:09.600 --> 35:18.120]  the Transylvanians that held the line for over a thousand years against the Muslims.
[35:18.120 --> 35:27.160]  They then populated the Austrian-Hungarian Empire's royal lines.
[35:27.160 --> 35:38.760]  They then became the House of Windsor when it became an issue 270 years ago to confuse
[35:38.760 --> 35:46.960]  the British population about their German king, George I.
[35:46.960 --> 35:53.120]  We went to war with his grandson, George III, but they were not even Germans.
[35:53.120 --> 35:58.480]  Now I said this segment, I would get into World War IV has begun.
[35:58.480 --> 36:03.000]  But if you want to understand World War IV, you have to understand World War I.
[36:03.000 --> 36:08.880]  To understand World War I, you need to understand the history of the Byzantine Empire and the
[36:08.880 --> 36:15.760]  Old Roman Empire before that, or the Greek systems, because it's all flowing in a continuum
[36:15.760 --> 36:23.400]  of history that the globalists are building and studying their system on, where they control
[36:23.400 --> 36:32.840]  the different pieces against each other to establish a merchant corporate planetary governance
[36:32.840 --> 36:41.760]  that no nation-state or rival can ever then pro-generate from to challenge their hegemonic
[36:41.760 --> 36:43.800]  rule.
[36:43.800 --> 36:53.720]  And the hegemony is not for simple power or rulership, but for an end game of a scientific
[36:53.720 --> 37:05.160]  dictatorship being financed by the ancient crown of the dragon against the free peoples
[37:05.160 --> 37:06.680]  of the world.
[37:06.680 --> 37:12.240]  Now let's get into what's currently happening.
[37:12.240 --> 37:19.200]  If you look at, that we should put on screen, just a shot of Asia Minor, India, and the
[37:19.200 --> 37:24.920]  surrounding countries, then we'll zoom in and focus in in a moment to Kashmir itself
[37:24.920 --> 37:35.880]  and why this is a central piece in the start of World War IV that has now officially begun.
[37:35.880 --> 37:46.720]  Now the CIA, please show a graphic of the larger region, please, thank you.
[37:46.720 --> 37:55.560]  The CIA properly has said since about the mid-80s that the Cold War was World War III
[37:55.560 --> 38:04.680]  and that the next war, which you see happening, would be economic trade wars, proxy wars,
[38:04.680 --> 38:23.840]  war wars, regional wars, and internal wars fought with information warfare by the different
[38:23.840 --> 38:31.680]  powers and systems of the planet, manipulating different groups within those countries, propaganda
[38:31.680 --> 38:34.120]  wars.
[38:34.120 --> 38:50.920]  And so we have Trump at the 11th hour, when all of this is unfolding, when America was
[38:50.920 --> 38:56.880]  supposed to fade off, be absorbed into a global government controlled by Communist China,
[38:56.880 --> 39:03.240]  as all of this was unfolding, as all of this was developing, incomes trumped, incomes other
[39:03.240 --> 39:06.120]  nationals around the world saying, why should we get rid of our countries?
[39:06.120 --> 39:15.200]  Why should we set up internal systems where it's impossible for us to be able to function
[39:15.200 --> 39:16.200]  and operate?
[39:16.200 --> 39:19.360]  Why should we give away freedom and accept global slavery?
[39:19.360 --> 39:21.560]  What is the benefit?
[39:21.560 --> 39:31.880]  And that was the Achilles heel of this global government system the entire time.
[39:31.880 --> 39:39.880]  It was why I knew it could always be defeated because you're going to have a private world
[39:39.880 --> 39:44.720]  corporate government that pays no taxes, that then foments race and culture war inside nation
[39:44.720 --> 39:49.200]  states to bring down the nation states and then merge it into a giant corporate world
[39:49.200 --> 39:51.000]  government that's anti-human.
[39:51.000 --> 39:54.160]  Why would anyone want to accept or be part of that?
[39:54.160 --> 40:03.200]  Why would anyone want to live in a world like that?
[40:03.200 --> 40:08.520]  So if we simply opposed it, I believe that individuals around the world and others would
[40:08.520 --> 40:11.360]  wake up and that we would come together and say no to this.
[40:11.360 --> 40:15.200]  And that's happened, common sense is taking place.
[40:15.200 --> 40:20.080]  And if you read the Financial Times of London, if you look at these other publications which
[40:20.080 --> 40:24.280]  are established with mouthpieces, they're saying our world order is over.
[40:24.280 --> 40:30.520]  The global government system we wanted is falling apart.
[40:30.520 --> 40:35.040]  China is going to get defeated in this trade war when it was supposedly the 800 trillion
[40:35.040 --> 40:43.760]  pound gorilla that was going to bring America to heel.
[40:43.760 --> 40:48.080]  We'll go to the maps and stuff when we come back.
[40:48.080 --> 40:53.120]  This is going to be really, really important because there's a lot of facets to this, but
[40:53.120 --> 41:04.520]  Trump told China, look, you've had one-sided deals and we're not going to do this anymore.
[41:04.520 --> 41:07.920]  We're not going to play these games anymore.
[41:07.920 --> 41:12.040]  And we're not going to just destroy America so you can mount its head on the wall and
[41:12.040 --> 41:13.440]  feel powerful.
[41:13.440 --> 41:16.920]  It's not going to happen.
[41:16.920 --> 41:20.960]  And when people saw the leadership of Brexit and the leadership of Trump and the leadership
[41:20.960 --> 41:25.400]  of Putin against world government and kicking the globalist out to a great extent, he's
[41:25.400 --> 41:29.480]  still fighting the exact same forces we're fighting.
[41:29.480 --> 41:35.120]  Like a chain reaction, people that had been suppressed by the world government model that
[41:35.120 --> 41:40.280]  came out of the end of World War II and the whole UN system and telling India you've got
[41:40.280 --> 41:48.720]  to give the birthplace of your culture, Kashmir, even though most of the lands around India,
[41:48.720 --> 41:54.040]  India was twice the size it is today, a thousand years ago, but the Muslims took it all from
[41:54.040 --> 41:57.840]  them and China has encroached and taken some.
[41:57.840 --> 42:01.880]  And they put their governors and their minions and their controllers in and we're not following
[42:01.880 --> 42:07.480]  the autonomous rule of Kashmir to let them have home rule but not have outside powers
[42:07.480 --> 42:08.480]  come in.
[42:08.480 --> 42:15.920]  And so India has been watching all of this happening, watching all of this unfold, watching
[42:15.920 --> 42:18.840]  all of this develop.
[42:18.840 --> 42:22.320]  And so their leader Modi came and met with Trump, one of the first leaders Trump met
[42:22.320 --> 42:23.320]  with.
[42:23.320 --> 42:26.680]  People said, why are you meeting with India so soon?
[42:26.680 --> 42:33.040]  Because India is at the center of the grand chessboard and now this is a proxy war where
[42:33.040 --> 42:39.120]  China threatens to invade Hong Kong is already invaded with paramilitary playing close threatens
[42:39.120 --> 42:46.040]  to go into Taiwan and is launching all these trade wars that Trump just responded to.
[42:46.040 --> 42:50.960]  And now they lowered their currency in response to Trump's 300 billion increase in tariffs
[42:50.960 --> 42:59.840]  and this is our move within hours of China devaluing their currency, India invaded.
[42:59.840 --> 43:03.800]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena in the public square.
[43:03.800 --> 43:08.280]  The other thing that's unique about info wars is it is the only network of this reach that
[43:08.280 --> 43:11.520]  is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy.
[43:11.520 --> 43:15.400]  That's not backed by some billionaire that's not being funded by secret foreign government.
[43:15.400 --> 43:21.240]  It is completely independent of all that it is an old school American 1776 style experiment
[43:21.240 --> 43:25.200]  in the expression of the freedom of press and freedom of speech that in fact the founders
[43:25.200 --> 43:29.800]  were so concerned with at the beginning of the country actually tried to support and subsidize
[43:29.800 --> 43:33.760]  organizations just like this because this was the kind of press they wanted and then ultimately
[43:33.760 --> 43:37.920]  we now live in an era where they mostly been co-opted by big corporation or billionaire
[43:37.920 --> 43:42.400]  sugar daddies who've been able to control and manipulate what news and views the persons
[43:42.400 --> 43:46.760]  allowed to have or express or hear and the info wars audience has broken through that
[43:46.760 --> 43:51.640]  the they are the bridge from the founding to the modern age ultimate American democracy
[43:51.640 --> 43:56.440]  and freedom and that's why there's been unprecedented onslaught of the black warming defamation
[43:56.440 --> 44:03.360]  law fair and libel targeting you as we witness the most disastrous geological activity in
[44:03.360 --> 44:09.120]  recorded history the globalists are backed into a corner and the leftists are pushing
[44:09.120 --> 44:15.800]  for civil war borders are being broken and sovereignty is being challenged the world
[44:15.800 --> 44:21.600]  is going to change and how it changes will likely be decided by those who are prepared
[44:21.600 --> 44:28.440]  to stay strong when the system fails the system is vulnerable electricity could be gone in
[44:28.440 --> 44:35.000]  an instant and grocery stores could be empty in three days having storeable foods and the
[44:35.000 --> 44:41.160]  ability to purify water will give you a fighting chance in the next level and being without
[44:41.160 --> 44:47.680]  puts you at the mercy of others or makes you a slave to a dying system by storeable foods
[44:47.680 --> 44:54.880]  and an Alexa pure gravity water filter today support mankind by being prepared and support
[44:54.880 --> 45:03.160]  freedom by buying from info wars store dot com I talk about this on the air and I know
[45:03.160 --> 45:07.160]  it sinks into people but I decided that we're going to kind of reboot all our supplements
[45:07.160 --> 45:10.720]  in that if you go back five six years ago before all the censorship of the tax and fake
[45:10.720 --> 45:14.160]  lawsuits the rest of it I would talk about how great the products are and how they were
[45:14.160 --> 45:18.040]  the best and why they were and I have doctors on an expert to explain why they were so good
[45:18.040 --> 45:21.720]  and instead the last few years I'm like hey we need to really support us or they'll shut
[45:21.720 --> 45:24.400]  us down the biggest thing people like to buy is supplements because they know how great
[45:24.400 --> 45:27.640]  they are and how wonderful they were and the left always has headlines everywhere.
[45:27.640 --> 45:32.920]  Jones sells unapproved supplements that he claims are supplements no under federal law
[45:32.920 --> 45:38.240]  since 1996 you can't say that a supplement has been through the FDA because they have
[45:38.240 --> 45:41.800]  no jurisdiction and won't look at it but then they say you've got to say it's not approved
[45:41.800 --> 45:46.320]  by them and all drugs are is the system trying to tweak what's in mother nature and manipulate
[45:46.320 --> 45:49.800]  it and do different things and a lot of drugs work great they have side effects not with
[45:49.800 --> 45:55.840]  mother nature but big pharma doesn't want you knowing about God's medicine chest infowarstore.com

[47:02.960 --> 47:28.920]  we're listening to the alex jones show
[47:28.920 --> 47:38.120]  world war four has begun the globalist model for planetary government is collapsing in on
[47:38.120 --> 47:44.340]  itself because china broke the deal to not militarily begin invading other countries
[47:44.340 --> 47:50.760]  if they were given economic supremacy that was the agreement but with obama and hillary
[47:50.760 --> 47:57.640]  the chai comms double crossed other globalist and the nationalist came in exploiting that
[47:57.640 --> 48:02.160]  fact and pointing out the populations and it's all a giant ripoff and a scam that nobody
[48:02.160 --> 48:09.440]  should want to be ruled by a distant king or by distant above the law robber barons
[48:09.440 --> 48:13.400]  and the nationalist started taking over in england with the brigsit and now with trump
[48:13.400 --> 48:19.560]  here and with other nationalists in brazil and many other areas and like dominoes are
[48:19.560 --> 48:25.920]  falling well china then began to devalue their currency china began to then send in paramilitary
[48:25.920 --> 48:31.000]  plane close trips into hong kong and into taiwan and threatened military strikes so
[48:31.000 --> 48:36.200]  trump working with modi when they made this deal two and a half years ago one of the first
[48:36.200 --> 48:39.440]  people trump met with when modi hugged him and they said modi never does that what's
[48:39.440 --> 48:45.080]  going on here he wouldn't stop hugging him because they'd already in private meetings
[48:45.080 --> 48:51.200]  on the phone and in person for hours reportedly this went on for days days of phone calls
[48:51.200 --> 48:56.280]  first thing trump did was talk to top strategist about real systems for america and the world
[48:56.280 --> 49:03.640]  and how to cut china off and how to destroy the new world order system well you you cut
[49:03.640 --> 49:07.320]  off china and you isolate them and you cut their energy off and you cut their oil off
[49:07.320 --> 49:14.280]  and you cut their water off and that's what they get from india so what happened why is
[49:14.280 --> 49:20.120]  this world war four world war four is fought with proxy wars it's fought with propaganda
[49:20.120 --> 49:25.320]  and manipulating domestic populations against each other and it's fought in all out military
[49:25.320 --> 49:32.400]  war as well that is the threat continuum here so now let's go over some of the history
[49:32.400 --> 49:37.400]  of islam you have it start with mohammed fourteen hundred years ago in mecca medina
[49:37.400 --> 49:41.600]  right in the middle of what saudi arabi today within a hundred years it invades and starts
[49:41.600 --> 49:48.320]  taking over asia minor that was the gateway to india and the old indian empire within
[49:48.320 --> 49:54.200]  four hundred years india is fighting for its life on screen is an image of india today
[49:54.200 --> 50:00.240]  let's show the old map of the indian empire as you can see it's a large part of china
[50:00.240 --> 50:08.400]  and many other areas going all the way up into iran and you can see asia minor to the
[50:08.400 --> 50:15.440]  west where all of the islamics poured in out of saudi arabia through iraq into iran taking
[50:15.440 --> 50:22.440]  over what was the old empire of india turning more than half of india into an islamic caliphate
[50:22.440 --> 50:30.880]  hundred to forty million hindus killed in a thousand year war i think we've been fighting
[50:30.880 --> 50:39.360]  islam a long time thousand year war well now modi is having his own crusade in nineteen
[50:39.360 --> 50:52.280]  forty nine in nineteen forty nine the un and the british empire and the globalist said
[50:52.280 --> 50:59.360]  to india you can have your independence you can move towards that you're gonna have to
[50:59.360 --> 51:08.280]  give this northern trade route between china and pakistan and budding up against the other
[51:08.280 --> 51:14.080]  stands in russia you're gonna have to give this key corridor over to an international
[51:14.080 --> 51:20.680]  group an autonomous zone run by the un well the un's globalist so it brought china in
[51:20.680 --> 51:29.240]  china wasn't part of it seventy years ago it was pakistan well now the end in control
[51:29.240 --> 51:33.280]  zone has gotten smaller and smaller and smaller and now they're even pushing up against the
[51:33.280 --> 51:40.840]  borders of what is still currently northern india today so for decades they were called
[51:40.840 --> 51:45.000]  extremist hindus who didn't like losing their country didn't like their women being killed
[51:45.000 --> 51:50.160]  didn't like being suicide bombed almost on a daily basis the leftist globalist media
[51:50.160 --> 51:55.960]  told them they were bad told them they were evil well they have a prime minister now that
[51:55.960 --> 52:04.360]  is a hindu radical as they call them an extremist a supremacist not off skin color the genetics
[52:04.360 --> 52:09.320]  of the pakistanis and the indians are the same pakistanis used to be indians remember
[52:09.320 --> 52:16.040]  all the old buddhist and hindu temples blown up by isis big giant beautiful ancient temples
[52:16.040 --> 52:21.080]  all blown up hundreds of them but you bet they're supremacist in wanting to live and not be
[52:21.080 --> 52:24.680]  killed they've already given up half their country they've already given up a hundred
[52:24.680 --> 52:29.120]  and forty million people they came to trump and they said we'll be your allies against
[52:29.120 --> 52:34.720]  china and against pakistan against everybody else if you just take the chains off we're
[52:34.720 --> 52:37.840]  going to go in there we're going to kick the u n out we're going to kick the chai comes
[52:37.840 --> 52:42.440]  out we're going to kick the pakistan government out the muslims can live in peace up there
[52:42.440 --> 52:45.680]  they used to be the minority now they're the majority but when they kill and bomb our
[52:45.680 --> 52:55.600]  people we're going to kill them and they said okay and that's what happened so you've got
[52:55.600 --> 52:59.760]  lord rothschild and all the globalists hitting the panic button with brixit and the trump
[52:59.760 --> 53:03.640]  election and all of them and now they don't know what to do and now the rothschilds want
[53:03.640 --> 53:10.200]  Benjamin Netanyahu out and they financed the globalist finance all the white supremacist
[53:10.200 --> 53:15.040]  groups to constantly attack netanyahu people say well why have you supported netanyahu
[53:15.040 --> 53:19.320]  because the globalists want him out the rothschilds own the economist magazine they call him a
[53:19.320 --> 53:24.600]  dictator doesn't mean netanyahu is perfect or anybody is perfect the point is i know
[53:24.600 --> 53:32.920]  who the real players are on the chessboard not fantasy land on the internet where israel's
[53:32.920 --> 53:39.520]  one monolithic evil and we have to be allies with islam because it's against israel that's
[53:39.520 --> 53:44.280]  how they tricked all these right wing people into being into all this bs that doesn't even
[53:44.280 --> 53:50.240]  exist in the world of real politics show let me boil it all down right here what's happening
[53:50.240 --> 53:53.520]  i know this is simple to most of you some new listeners are like what are we talking
[53:53.520 --> 54:03.200]  about india had more of its country taken in nineteen forty nine by the un the globalist
[54:03.200 --> 54:08.320]  china was muscling in now and even pushing rebels and attacks through their ally pakistan
[54:08.320 --> 54:18.040]  against the indian homeland that they got left trump made a deal with modi that if china
[54:18.040 --> 54:22.760]  kept doing this and china got expansionist and china started trying to invade the south
[54:22.760 --> 54:27.760]  china sea which they're doing building these islands attacking ships boarding ships sending
[54:27.760 --> 54:33.400]  in motorcycle gangs or their paramilitary to attack in mass beat men women children in
[54:33.400 --> 54:39.680]  hong kong that oh you're gonna do that you're gonna attack over here we're gonna turn india
[54:39.680 --> 54:47.400]  loose to flood in with their troops cut the internet and you better believe the islamic
[54:47.400 --> 54:54.280]  leaders are getting their throat slit right now so india is taking its country back right
[54:54.280 --> 54:59.560]  now and this is a total proxy war and you bet pakistan is gonna unleash a bunch of hell
[54:59.560 --> 55:04.040]  they've got a bunch of nuclear weapons they say they're gonna retaliate massively china
[55:04.040 --> 55:08.920]  says they're gonna retaliate india says fine we'll cut you damn water off and all this
[55:08.920 --> 55:18.160]  is going on all this is happening and you turn on u.s. news there's almost nothing on
[55:18.160 --> 55:24.480]  this so the fact that trump is breaking the international order all these nation states
[55:24.480 --> 55:30.440]  that have been forced to give into islam you know the clintons gave a third of syria
[55:30.440 --> 55:35.400]  to the albanians and to the muslims who've been ethnic cleansing serves for a thousand
[55:35.400 --> 55:40.800]  years and even the un reported that it that twice as many serves were killed by muslims
[55:40.800 --> 55:45.640]  the muslims were killed but it doesn't matter because we fetishize all of this and that's
[55:45.640 --> 55:52.400]  the model of the globalist using islam to invade europe radical globalist islam is the
[55:52.400 --> 56:01.880]  sword of the new world order it's been invading europe for over a thousand years asia minor
[56:01.880 --> 56:11.520]  was christian it's not anymore it's islamic turkey all those places were christian gone
[56:11.520 --> 56:17.920]  gone gone gone gone live in peace they say ilhan omar live in peace we come in peace
[56:17.920 --> 56:23.480]  so this is world government that they've set up with islam as their invasion forces are
[56:23.480 --> 56:28.040]  shock troops and political correctness saying lower your borders lower your defenses saying
[56:28.040 --> 56:31.680]  you're a nationalist means you're a white supremacist what do they call the indians
[56:31.680 --> 56:36.240]  hindu extremist hindu supremacist because they don't want to be killed they've already
[56:36.240 --> 56:42.560]  given up half their country in a thousand year war and they've got to give it up to the
[56:42.560 --> 56:50.040]  chikams allied with pakistan but china doesn't let any muslims into their country and the
[56:50.040 --> 56:55.760]  muslim population of mongolia that used to be controlled by india guess what they're
[56:55.760 --> 57:02.280]  in concentration camps real ones were they working to death see china knows a weapon
[57:02.280 --> 57:06.760]  when they've got it they don't turn it and shoot themselves they use it on us and they're
[57:06.760 --> 57:13.960]  funding hollywood and the media remember what happened in the cold war our own media was
[57:13.960 --> 57:17.520]  against our country and for russia because the globalist had control of russia and the
[57:17.520 --> 57:21.840]  globalist had control of our media so they were for russia because they were feeding
[57:21.840 --> 57:26.320]  on russia now russia's out from under their control partially so now russia's our enemy
[57:26.320 --> 57:30.480]  and the very media that love russia hates russia and says the patriots that are americans
[57:30.480 --> 57:34.080]  are with putin well we are with putin and that we're nationalists too and want our country
[57:34.080 --> 57:39.880]  back to the very same media that sided with russia all those years the cold war is now
[57:39.880 --> 57:44.400]  siding with china and the globalist all these liberals are the useful idiots of the chikams
[57:44.400 --> 57:49.960]  of the globalist destroying their own future china pays for the propaganda george arwell
[57:49.960 --> 57:55.800]  said that in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act and so used
[57:55.800 --> 58:00.120]  to it wasn't that important to wear the american flag because we still loved our country and
[58:00.120 --> 58:04.480]  there wasn't a large group of people that actually hated it but now they're trying to take it
[58:04.480 --> 58:08.680]  out of schools they're taking it down off of government buildings weird white leftist
[58:08.680 --> 58:13.440]  that when a virtue signaler pulling down american flags and running up mexican flags this is
[58:13.440 --> 58:17.880]  the bizarreness of the america hating we're seeing so now it is a revolutionary act in
[58:17.880 --> 58:23.160]  the time of incredible deceit and oppression and bullying to wear the american flag particularly
[58:23.160 --> 58:28.600]  the betsy ross anti-slavery flag and particularly when it says on the back right there ladies
[58:28.600 --> 58:34.400]  and gentlemen america's back in full wars dot com so whatever you do take action today
[58:34.400 --> 58:39.400]  and exercise your free speech in these bullies face all over not just the u.s. but worldwide
[58:39.400 --> 58:50.040]  because more than ever the american flag is a symbol of freedom against globalism
[58:50.040 --> 59:06.000]  that's why the courts the judges the juries the members of the independent free press
[59:06.000 --> 59:09.120]  that care about this the ordinary members of the public in the audience that care about
[59:09.120 --> 59:13.800]  this has to bring real social political economic consequence to their course of conduct otherwise
[59:13.800 --> 59:17.520]  they will never change and they will become the big tech oligarchs the equivalent to the
[59:17.520 --> 59:21.320]  big trust of the nineteenth century who ran american politics and ran american economy
[59:21.320 --> 59:24.760]  almost into the ground until we were able to recover after the great depression the
[59:24.760 --> 59:29.680]  informer's audience is the fuel that flames the the light of liberty across the world
[59:29.680 --> 59:34.200]  to make real the actions of independent free speech to make real the original promise of
[59:34.200 --> 59:38.560]  an independent free press real collusion is big tech and big media manipulating and working
[59:38.560 --> 59:42.280]  with each other to try to meddle with elections to try to shake people's thoughts and then
[59:42.280 --> 59:46.080]  the whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening it's the ultimate form of gas
[59:46.080 --> 59:53.960]  lighting what you just saw isn't what you just saw even it is what what you just saw
[59:53.960 --> 01:00:17.680]  we're listening to the alex jones show now the globalists have built their entire planetary
[01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:29.920]  strategy around bringing down the nation state and then turning countries against each other
[01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:36.000]  trump wants a system based on free independence and the globalist world order is now in deep
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:41.320]  crisis and is falling apart i'm going to get more into that in the next segment that will
[01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:47.360]  cover all the news but these are giant huge developments and in the globalist publications
[01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:53.560]  they're basically jumping out windows they are in full complete absolute total panic
[01:00:53.560 --> 01:01:00.360]  mode so coming up next segment i'm going to get up and walk around and go over some of
[01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:07.600]  the history of this because those that don't know history are doomed to repeat it no one
[01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:13.640]  can doubt that info wars has changed the world the globalists give us credit for discrediting
[01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:21.400]  their world government system their neoliberal fascist plan and infecting in their words
[01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:28.800]  the entire world with nationalism now how did i do that i did that because of you we
[01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:33.920]  did that you did that we're going to have freedom we're going to have slavery and these
[01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:38.880]  corporates play nation states off against each other they played men and women off against
[01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:43.640]  each other they put people off against each other for color skin is but the people of
[01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:48.800]  the world more and more are seeing through it and that's why i want all of you right
[01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:54.120]  now as the world government falls apart as the new world order hits the panic button
[01:01:54.120 --> 01:02:00.680]  and tries to start a race war to realize that we have come so far and that all these globalists
[01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:08.520]  have now is trying to stir up internal information warfare fights but we knew history and knew
[01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:13.920]  that these globalists are arrogant and there would come a time when their system would
[01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:22.960]  enter a crisis when it actually tried to implement it's incredibly anti-human agenda you know
[01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:29.480]  i don't spend valuable time on air showing you the infrastructure here showing you what
[01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:34.760]  goes into it showing you how much money it costs to run this and do this especially

[01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:41.800]  war where Chinese propaganda funding Hollywood and their leftist cohorts publicly the biggest
[01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:47.400]  buyer of ads and propaganda they own Hollywood are literally using classic British style
[01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:53.520]  or Roman style divide and conquer race war and religious war against us again if you're
[01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:57.000]  a TV viewer you can see the big map behind me let's go right over here I'm going to just
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:03.720]  give you a brief gestalt lay history anybody can go research this for yourself about how
[01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:12.480]  Trump is launching via India a proxy war China has begun to invade Hong Kong with paramilitary
[01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:17.800]  in plain clothes and thousands of men on motorcycles that are military and police attacking men
[01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:22.840]  women and children they're threatening to invade Taiwan they're threatening to attack
[01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:27.800]  Japanese islands they are claiming islands of the Philippines they're building artificial
[01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:34.480]  islands so to understand what Trump's doing we have to understand the history of it China
[01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:41.000]  just 50 years ago didn't have electricity in 90% of the country they were rural farmers
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:48.680]  60 years ago the globalists came in set them up let Mao kill 100 million of his own people
[01:07:48.680 --> 01:07:53.600]  took them all in collective Eisenman major cities Chinese were the first robots they
[01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:58.440]  were slave human robots basically people with souls about saying they are robots they were
[01:07:58.440 --> 01:08:03.760]  used as a robot clone army to build the giant factories the giant cities the giant weapon
[01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:10.640]  systems they were given all our weapons a Panama Canal all of our infrastructure 98%
[01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:16.320]  rarest men role monopoly by the global cartel to maneuver the United States into a position
[01:08:16.320 --> 01:08:19.320]  of weakness now the way they got the Pentagon to go along with this they said oh well you
[01:08:19.320 --> 01:08:25.280]  China leverage out Russia and others this is 30 years ago let them into the WTO 25 years
[01:08:25.280 --> 01:08:31.600]  ago and we'll do all of this but they'll never have a military outside of their country they
[01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:36.560]  promise they'll never be expansionist as soon as Obama got in they violated all of that
[01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:41.560]  Obama gave him the office of personnel management hack rolled up all of our agents worldwide
[01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:45.680]  total trees in Apple Google moved there 10 years ago they admit they moved there last
[01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:50.240]  year they have all the code keys to all your devices that was even Reuters last year really
[01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:57.480]  happened 10 years ago so to understand this proxy war militarily and from a resource perspective
[01:08:57.480 --> 01:09:01.160]  then we'll get into the propaganda war which is really how they're attacking us we've got
[01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:06.920]  Google Maps up here you've got from the Atlantic Ocean and Spain and Western Europe through
[01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:12.880]  Central and Eastern Europe into the Middle East Asia Minor Central Asia and then into
[01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:20.920]  the Far East with China and Japan now let's look at this this is critical 1400 years ago
[01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:28.040]  Muhammad is right here he takes over the key crossroads of the caravans coming out of the
[01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:34.600]  Empire of India that stretched all the way over to Iran and all the way into the China
[01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:40.880]  India was the dominant force not China not Japan at that time they were the most powerful
[01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:50.480]  Empire in the East and were expanding trade so that's what's happening in India within
[01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:57.360]  a hundred years of Muhammad dying they've already invaded and taken over many areas of the Middle
[01:09:57.360 --> 01:10:01.880]  East later they take over Turkey that was European which again was the Eastern Empire
[01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:07.800]  was left the Roman Empire within a thousand years ago within just a few hundred years
[01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:12.280]  of Muhammad's death they have already taken over what's Pakistan today pushed the Indian
[01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:19.320]  Empire back taken over and surrounded India you have Kashmir that is the birthplace of
[01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:25.880]  the Indian culture and who were Anglos that's just an interesting fact of that and set up
[01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:30.120]  India and then from folks flooded in from all the world because there was so much prosperity
[01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:36.120]  in that area so this was a basically a European expeditionary force in Kashmir that settled
[01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:39.440]  in that area that's just part of the caste system it's racist it's not right but you
[01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:44.280]  know the upper caste was white and that's just how it worked okay but Islam was even worse
[01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:50.320]  so all of that's going on that's just some of the background so China is over here they're
[01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:55.760]  starting to go into Hong Kong we're starting to go into Taiwan they're threatening Japan
[01:10:55.760 --> 01:11:00.000]  they're building islands all over the place way down here even by the Philippines Philippines
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:04.080]  is having to threaten them now you know Japan invaded the Philippines and start in World
[01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:09.080]  War two well China's basically doing that right now and they're sending in their companies
[01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:14.080]  that are really paramilitary and others they're taking over the colleges they're buying everybody
[01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:17.560]  off just like they're doing here they're buying off the media they're using all this incredible
[01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:23.400]  money they've been given by us giving trade superiority of 900 billion a year for decades
[01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:29.640]  to be able to just take over the planet again they were given 98% of rare minerals you just
[01:11:29.640 --> 01:11:34.240]  don't get that no one else is allowed by the global is to operate they sue you the UN
[01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:38.920]  comes after you China is able to do human clones take people's organs they just do whatever
[01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:42.960]  the hell they want they're God basically because they're an evil Chai Kong force feeding on
[01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:47.720]  their own people they're the model of the global technocracy the NWO wants so Trump
[01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:51.880]  and Japan and South Korea and others form an alliance soon as Trump gets elected he
[01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:55.280]  says this new order is a screw job for everybody we're not going along with it including the
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:12:03.760]  Chinese people they don't like it he meets with the leader of India he hugs him he says
[01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:08.240]  hey if China gives you problems and keeps trying to take over cashmere then in 49 the
[01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:14.440]  UN made India create an autonomous zone which then now China has come in and openly taken
[01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:18.840]  over about a third of the country the islamics are pouring in now pushing to the new borders
[01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:24.160]  of India and trying to take India proper over itself and again leftist media calls it Indian
[01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:31.240]  extremism they call him a Hindu extremist even though the Pakistanis were Indians until
[01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:35.000]  the islamics took it over there's there's Hindu and Buddhist temples all over Pakistan
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:41.040]  well there were the Muslims blew them all up so all of this is happening all of this
[01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:45.680]  is going on and then once they take your country over they remove any symbols you ever existed
[01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:50.160]  so they erased that they were Indians so now this extremists like everybody's a white
[01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:54.240]  supremacist Trump's a white supremacist for want to have a border okay well now the Indians
[01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:58.880]  are Hindu extremists because they want to exist and don't want to be slaughtered so
[01:12:58.880 --> 01:13:04.640]  you've got China bordering right here in what is cashmere and we can probably put that slide
[01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:09.960]  up and then go back to this in a moment and so Trump green lighted go ahead you're not
[01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:17.840]  under that UN thing anymore go in within hours of what happened with the currency devaluation
[01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:24.600]  within hours they sent the troops in the Indians did and I don't want to be clear India didn't
[01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:31.320]  invade cashmere cashmere was stolen from it when the British Empire was dissolving and
[01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:35.880]  becoming the new world order because India never really got its freedom under their
[01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:42.200]  current leader India is to a certain extent actually becoming independent finally that's
[01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:46.000]  the reality and Muhammad Gandhi said a lot of great stuff turns out he was a British
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:51.480]  agent who was segwaying away from empire but really they just took the British flag down
[01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:56.680]  and it was still controlled by England but not England itself the model the world government
[01:13:56.680 --> 01:14:02.280]  system set up by Cecil Rhodes and others hello this is all PhD level mainline history this
[01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:07.600]  is mainline history in any real thousand page you know stuff not not not pop history but
[01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:12.640]  the real history and I'm giving you a basic generalization okay I'm not a historian on
[01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:17.160]  this I've just read over a thousand history books probably 15 or so on this subject it's
[01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:20.840]  all very very fascinating I've always wanted to go to cashmere it's a very very beautiful
[01:14:20.840 --> 01:14:27.720]  and mystic place so you got China right here and this is the key piece in the whole chess
[01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:32.000]  board is this whole fight going on over India because you'll control the trade routes you
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:37.320]  control the water you'll control everything into Burma and Thailand and Vietnam and the
[01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:44.160]  Philippines who've all had wars with China China's currently in physical war with Vietnam
[01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:48.840]  trying to steal their oil fields and their coastlines China is completely expansionist
[01:14:48.840 --> 01:14:54.120]  completely out of control so we're all told Russia is the enemy and expansionist because
[01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:58.520]  Russia is not expansionist Russia has cut their defense budget and kicked the globalist
[01:14:58.520 --> 01:15:04.320]  out of the country in the early 1990s and to a certain extent has defeated the left trying
[01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:08.600]  to make little boys cut their genitals off and all the rest of it the same demoralization
[01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:12.000]  funded by the chai comms the chai comms will kill you if you preach that propaganda in
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:16.680]  China but they finance it for Russia they finance it for America they finance it for
[01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:22.720]  Europe they admit to undermine and demoralize us all the leftist garbage all the trash all
[01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:27.040]  the anti-family stuff it's funded right out of there into the Tabistock Institute into
[01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:32.040]  Hollywood China funds it all because they were set up to do this and demoralize the
[01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:40.520]  West and so Trump has turned the Indians loose be on their flank and to let China know you're
[01:15:40.520 --> 01:15:45.480]  now in a vice grip and this is the stuff that World War four is made of this is the real
[01:15:45.480 --> 01:15:48.640]  deal doesn't mean nuclear missiles doesn't mean huge explosions even though both sides
[01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:53.880]  are nuclear powers India and Pakistan it means Trump's taken the gloves off he's for real
[01:15:53.880 --> 01:15:58.040]  this is really happening and the house of world government is dead finally there's a

[01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:38.200]  you know and I want to stop them I want to beat them and I get so excited watching the
[01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:44.040]  tide start to turn for nationalism and watch all the globalist publications from the CFR
[01:21:44.040 --> 01:21:52.480]  to the financial times of London to the Atlantic panic and say my god it's all burning down
[01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:58.800]  then they go further they say world war will happen you didn't allow our world government
[01:21:58.800 --> 01:22:03.280]  so I'm going to take you inside how they get people to sign on to this and how they threaten
[01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:10.760]  other people who won't sign on to it they threaten physical thermo nuclear war so we're
[01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:18.400]  going to be talking about that in just a moment and in fact guys get me a clear shot please
[01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:22.320]  I wasn't clear in the break I'm sorry I wanted on the further end of the screen to have Turkey
[01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:30.320]  small right through blown up so that we can see China as we can see Japan yeah that's
[01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:35.920]  a good shot go ahead and roll that up a little bit for me that's good right there stop there
[01:22:35.920 --> 01:22:38.840]  thank you we'll go to that in a moment radio listeners I'm describing all this get your
[01:22:38.840 --> 01:22:48.160]  maps out and this is just basic stuff but you have to read a PhD level book that they
[01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:54.480]  give to the Foreign Service of the State Department called tragedy and hope it's 1100 pages long
[01:22:54.480 --> 01:22:58.840]  because the CIA the State Department they'd say we're for communism secretly but we're
[01:22:58.840 --> 01:23:04.400]  not but there's a balance between it and we're going to bring in this system and then and
[01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:08.360]  then and then cause wars to end wars and then merge all the countries together at the end
[01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:14.000]  of it it all comes out of again Cecil Rhodes Bertrand Russell later you can read all this
[01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:20.320]  leftist philosophy and it is the most sickening evil you've ever heard Bertrand Russell in
[01:23:20.320 --> 01:23:25.640]  the 20s wrote about giant stealth bombers they look just like stealth bombers in his
[01:23:25.640 --> 01:23:32.080]  book they put it in h.g. Wells is a movie the things to come that also came out in the
[01:23:32.080 --> 01:23:41.080]  30s but the book was in the 20s and the plan by h.g. Wells and Bertrand Russell who Hitler
[01:23:41.080 --> 01:23:44.640]  actually had a hit out on both of them you look that up because they were competing world
[01:23:44.640 --> 01:23:51.040]  government ideologues Joseph Gerbles wanted them both killed look that up because again
[01:23:51.040 --> 01:23:54.960]  they were popularizing some of the plans the Nazis had as well you know the space shuttle
[01:23:54.960 --> 01:23:59.600]  was the design of the Nazis to go up and turn upside down with this cargo bag and drop atomic
[01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:07.200]  bombs on New York Chicago as it went over then it would change the orbit come in and
[01:24:07.200 --> 01:24:11.320]  do a bombing run across the middle of the country they thought they could put six atomic
[01:24:11.320 --> 01:24:14.480]  bombs in it but see I digress this thing about history it's so incredible sorry let
[01:24:14.480 --> 01:24:22.440]  me get back to what I was saying I got sidetracked that's why history is just so addicting but
[01:24:22.440 --> 01:24:25.740]  they had this world government plan and this is how they sell people on it when they get
[01:24:25.740 --> 01:24:33.560]  them into college and if you're top of your class or you are from aristocratic family
[01:24:33.560 --> 01:24:36.840]  they call you in day one and say we've got to have a world government for everybody's
[01:24:36.840 --> 01:24:42.200]  good we've got to bring this system in we've got to do some really bad things to be worse
[01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:47.640]  than the evil guys so that way we can control the outcome but really you're just being recruited
[01:24:47.640 --> 01:24:54.280]  into a world corporate government that's anti god anti family whose master has been telling
[01:24:54.280 --> 01:24:58.560]  them for hundreds of years they're going to develop sciences and technologies to become
[01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:04.360]  immortal but they've got to transcend humanity and exterminate humanity first before their
[01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:08.920]  god lets them merge with the secret technology now I told you this 20 years ago because I
[01:25:08.920 --> 01:25:12.520]  was reading their writings now you see all the big tech guys saying this but they're
[01:25:12.520 --> 01:25:18.040]  saying it's good including Elon Musk you will merge with AI you will take the wires in your
[01:25:18.040 --> 01:25:22.760]  head starting next year at the mall your daughter thinks it's so cool it's just like it in your
[01:25:22.760 --> 01:25:28.760]  ears pierced oh David Rockefeller set it up now it's run by Bill Gates they announced
[01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:34.640]  Smithsonian chemtrails that they're adding to the jet fuel barium salts loom dioxide
[01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:40.040]  to spray to save the earth from global warming all admitted this week remember never existed
[01:25:40.040 --> 01:25:46.240]  all admitted this week you see but I'm digressing how do they sell people on this whole world
[01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:50.720]  government plan that's in so much trouble because Trump and others aren't playing along
[01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:55.960]  if you don't let the Muslims take over if you don't get rid of your sovereignty if you
[01:25:55.960 --> 01:26:01.080]  don't create these homogenized populations where no one's allowed to have their culture
[01:26:01.080 --> 01:26:05.760]  except Islam for some reason then there's going to be wars like we had in World War
[01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:11.720]  1 and World War 2 but when you read deeper into the documents of roads of Bertrand Russell
[01:26:11.720 --> 01:26:17.760]  that's why I got off on him is he said once we get world government partially we're going
[01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:23.000]  to have giant atomic bombers this is before they even built the Manhattan project because
[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:31.800]  they already had had the equations in 1898 Max Plain we will then nuke countries that
[01:26:31.800 --> 01:26:37.640]  don't turn their sovereignty over to us and now you see that with the UN and all the rest
[01:26:37.640 --> 01:26:41.720]  of it if you don't do what the UN says well then the US comes and invades you so that's
[01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:48.560]  the old world government plan okay that's what they tell people is if you don't go along
[01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:54.840]  with the world government plan what did Yunker whose grandfather ran the Nazi war machine
[01:26:54.840 --> 01:26:58.760]  top royalty what what did Yunker say this year and last year he said if you break up
[01:26:58.760 --> 01:27:02.840]  the EU there's going to be a giant war he said if you don't let China take over there's
[01:27:02.840 --> 01:27:07.520]  going to be a giant war if you don't want these corporations running these big giant
[01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:12.360]  countries like China take over there's going to be war because they're going to start a
[01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:18.320]  war but even when you go along with them they still start a war China is invading all these
[01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:25.000]  countries building islands saying they own a lot of the South China Sea saying they own
[01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:28.480]  part of the Philippines saying they own the Spratly Islands saying they own all this stuff
[01:27:28.480 --> 01:27:34.320]  it's insane and they're sending in their proxy armies and they're owning Netflix and they
[01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:40.180]  own the big six firms for they own our national debt because the globalists set them up to
[01:27:40.180 --> 01:27:45.840]  take over the planet because they have a billion three hundred million people under dictatorship
[01:27:45.840 --> 01:27:52.080]  who work 18 hours a day with no environmental services no workers comp no political correctness
[01:27:52.080 --> 01:27:58.320]  and if you're gay they kill you how do we compete with total slave colony of that size
[01:27:58.320 --> 01:28:03.360]  the globalists are using we stop giving them all of our money we stop giving them all of
[01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:08.760]  our trade it doesn't help the people all the money that goes into China and it is leveraged
[01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:13.600]  out for world government and leveraged out to take over Africa and take over Latin America
[01:28:13.600 --> 01:28:18.880]  China's putting the Chinese social score internet censorship in to Venezuela and other areas
[01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:24.200]  they're putting 5g into America this is the big competing tentacled monster because it
[01:28:24.200 --> 01:28:29.480]  has no constraints taking over so Trump says you're going to invade all these places we're
[01:28:29.480 --> 01:28:34.520]  going to have India take back its own country and cut off your water and your food see how
[01:28:34.520 --> 01:28:39.200]  you like that and oh you just cut off your purchasing of American food China what are

[01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:24.120]  this may be one of the biggest and most impactful decisions facebook has ever made facebook

[01:33:58.200 --> 01:34:03.520]  censorship how dangerous is info what is the difference at this point between trumps twitter
[01:34:03.520 --> 01:34:08.000]  feed and info wars dot com info wars tells viewers that the world is out to get them none
[01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:14.160]  of this seems to repel president trump info wars content is useful to him info wars personalities
[01:34:14.160 --> 01:34:18.280]  aligned with them i want them shut down i want them silence i want them muted i think they
[01:34:18.280 --> 01:34:23.760]  are horrible for our society i want them shut down i want them silenced i want them muted
[01:34:23.760 --> 01:34:29.960]  because these corporations are controlled by a liberal few we're very focused on making
[01:34:29.960 --> 01:34:34.960]  sure that our recommendations and discovery surfaces aren't highlighting groups where
[01:34:34.960 --> 01:34:39.120]  people are repeatedly sharing misinformation or harmful content and we're working hard
[01:34:39.120 --> 01:34:45.960]  to completely remove groups if they exist primarily to violate our policies or do things
[01:34:45.960 --> 01:34:50.280]  that are dangerous through your rules your rules go against our values and they are patently
[01:34:50.280 --> 01:34:56.080]  unamerican mark zuckerberg is not simply censoring opinions he's prescribing which political
[01:34:56.080 --> 01:35:01.880]  opinions you're allowed to have we need a digital bill of rights they are becoming the public
[01:35:01.880 --> 01:35:06.640]  square and they control how we interact with each other and if you think that you are going
[01:35:06.640 --> 01:35:10.560]  to throw up your hands and say well they're private companies you are absolutely insane
[01:35:10.560 --> 01:35:14.480]  and you are part of the problem you are a bad person you should be censored off the internet
[01:35:14.480 --> 01:35:19.160]  bad yes but get out of here alex info wars might have been banned from from twitter but
[01:35:19.160 --> 01:35:22.640]  it seems to have found a new home over at trump's twitter feed president trump's furious
[01:35:22.640 --> 01:35:30.520]  reaction to facebook's action showcases that he is i'm sorry to say that info wars president
[01:35:30.520 --> 01:35:40.280]  info wars the most banned network in the world how dangerous it is info wars
[01:35:40.280 --> 01:36:03.400]  a lot of stuff going on in the world i got pretty manic the last hour world war four
[01:36:03.400 --> 01:36:09.960]  is here how many different angles are there to that how many different angles are there
[01:36:09.960 --> 01:36:19.520]  to that how many different angles because i'm obsessing over india and over cashmere
[01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:26.080]  which is india that the un took from them when they started fighting for their independence
[01:36:26.080 --> 01:36:33.200]  and gave the muslims and now india has come in to take back their land and there's no
[01:36:33.200 --> 01:36:39.760]  coverage of the media because they don't know what to do because when you read the cfr
[01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:44.320]  reports they say our whole world governments falling apart trump is encircling china china
[01:36:44.320 --> 01:36:50.080]  was supposed to beat the u.s. this is a catastrophe they're calling it the china that kills its
[01:36:50.080 --> 01:36:54.400]  political dissidents and sells their organs that creates human animal clones that does
[01:36:54.400 --> 01:37:00.200]  all these things i told you about decades ago is now doing it out in the open a godless
[01:37:00.200 --> 01:37:08.480]  evil group of communists sitting on top of those poor billion four hundred million people
[01:37:08.480 --> 01:37:13.080]  seen as robot slaves to serve the globalist order to deindustrialize the world to leverage
[01:37:13.080 --> 01:37:19.120]  out all competition well all of that is coming to a screeching halt and china thinks they're
[01:37:19.120 --> 01:37:24.720]  going to invade taiwan or hong kong thinks they're going to invade vietnam which they've
[01:37:24.720 --> 01:37:29.680]  been doing that's a war going on it's all just huge wars thousands dead don't make
[01:37:29.680 --> 01:37:34.320]  deal and trump says you know what india the whole world government system of the british
[01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:40.120]  empire being handed over to the u.s. 70 years ago is over we want to go and trade and and
[01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:47.600]  straight up no more screw jobs and the prime minister hug trump and there were announcements
[01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:52.240]  in india that if china and pakistan keep trying to take over india that they're going to invade
[01:37:52.240 --> 01:38:00.920]  cashmere and they did it yesterday you understand that's huge ladies and gentlemen that is a
[01:38:00.920 --> 01:38:08.520]  proxy war and what did china think so this is a game of brinkmanship was all pre-planned
[01:38:08.520 --> 01:38:12.120]  if china does this we do that trump came out and said hey just give us 200 billion and stop
[01:38:12.120 --> 01:38:16.920]  stealing our intellectual property i know it was all of it was given to you and they
[01:38:16.920 --> 01:38:23.920]  said no okay 500 billion then in tariffs another 300 billion in tariffs now trump has brought
[01:38:23.920 --> 01:38:29.840]  it to the point basically of what china steals from us each year he's put on them now they've
[01:38:29.840 --> 01:38:36.080]  been doing it for 30 years or more 25 years in the wto even worse but imagine how incredible
[01:38:36.080 --> 01:38:40.440]  this is that every time i'm doubting trump where he comes i says well maybe we need gun
[01:38:40.440 --> 01:38:46.360]  control tell me what you want they go ban everything and then they get nothing see and
[01:38:46.360 --> 01:38:52.440]  then he does this which is the move if you really were for america if you were really
[01:38:52.440 --> 01:38:56.680]  for india if you're really for freedom if you really don't like china dominating the
[01:38:56.680 --> 01:39:02.880]  world and trying to invade all these countries and trying to build this whole road system
[01:39:02.880 --> 01:39:09.560]  out of there to project their power and and take over the entire middle east this is putting
[01:39:09.560 --> 01:39:16.600]  them in check and i mean that as in chesh china is in check right now now they could
[01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:24.120]  decide to have a nuclear war or maybe they're gonna decide to try to invade cashmere which
[01:39:24.120 --> 01:39:28.040]  they've taken a third of which they never had a right to maybe they're gonna team up
[01:39:28.040 --> 01:39:35.440]  against india maybe the chinese are gonna team up against india with pakistan by the
[01:39:35.440 --> 01:39:41.960]  way they've had huge wars with hundreds of thousands dead between pakistan and india over
[01:39:41.960 --> 01:39:51.000]  cashmere three of them three big ones so world war four has begun it's a proxy war world
[01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:56.160]  war three was the cold war oh and shroyer hosts the war room and does an incredibly good
[01:39:56.160 --> 01:40:01.760]  job kicking butt at that and he has also been de-platformed along with yours truly because
[01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:07.560]  he dare associates with voldemort the one who shall not be named they were rebel in

[01:41:26.760 --> 01:41:32.000]  you know you talked about something actually earlier today that i thought was incredible
[01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:39.840]  just how you were able to explain it we are in essentially a telekinetic interdimensional
[01:41:39.840 --> 01:41:47.800]  internet as humans already which god designed us all as one system experiencing the world
[01:41:47.800 --> 01:41:55.200]  through his design and so they try to jack into that with chemical doorways thinking
[01:41:55.200 --> 01:42:00.640]  they can play god and learn these paths of communication and how to manipulate humanity
[01:42:00.640 --> 01:42:03.440]  maybe they're successful at it maybe they haven't maybe they haven't been maybe new people are
[01:42:03.440 --> 01:42:10.800]  experimenting with it and so that's like the ai system that they're now trying to build
[01:42:10.800 --> 01:42:15.600]  and so the reason why i think china is such a hotbed as well as the ai is about to come
[01:42:15.600 --> 01:42:19.840]  out of california and they've got the population of you know whatever it is six billion people
[01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:25.280]  to test it on the infrastructure already built so billion four million so as all these currencies
[01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:30.680]  are about to collapse including the uan which they do it intentionally what is the future
[01:42:30.680 --> 01:42:34.920]  of an economic market what is the future of the economy what is the future of commerce
[01:42:34.920 --> 01:42:40.120]  it's ai and if china has all of that already built into this infrastructure then they think
[01:42:40.120 --> 01:42:44.520]  that'll be a better investment than gold or anything else that's right the globalists
[01:42:44.520 --> 01:42:49.280]  are betting on china's tyranny and on its evil it's totally satanic let's talk about

[01:45:02.400 --> 01:45:06.760]  thing that's unique about info wars is it isn't the only network of this reach that
[01:45:06.760 --> 01:45:11.640]  is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy that's not backed by some billionaire
[01:45:11.640 --> 01:45:15.360]  that's not being funded by a secret foreign government it is completely independent of
[01:45:15.360 --> 01:45:20.560]  all that it is an old school american 1776 style experiment in the expression of the
[01:45:20.560 --> 01:45:24.840]  freedom of press and freedom of speech that in fact the founders were so concerned with
[01:45:24.840 --> 01:45:28.960]  at the beginning of the country they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations
[01:45:28.960 --> 01:45:32.400]  just like this because this was the kind of press they wanted and then ultimately we
[01:45:32.400 --> 01:45:36.440]  now live in an era where they've mostly been co-opted by big corporations or billionaire
[01:45:36.440 --> 01:45:40.960]  sugar daddies who've been able to control and manipulate what news it views the persons
[01:45:40.960 --> 01:45:45.280]  allowed to have or express or hear and the info wars audience has broken through that
[01:45:45.280 --> 01:45:50.160]  the they are the bridge from the founding to the modern age ultimate american democracy
[01:45:50.160 --> 01:45:54.080]  and freedom and that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught of the black warming
[01:45:54.080 --> 01:46:00.760]  defamation lawfare and libel targeting you call it yes i got a plug for the patriot points
[01:46:00.760 --> 01:46:05.120]  i get a hundred eighty dollars so far this year and i feel like i'm stealing from you
[01:46:05.120 --> 01:46:08.320]  i buy so much in the store because i mean i don't want to give that money to walmart
[01:46:08.320 --> 01:46:11.280]  i don't want to give that money to people going to donate it to causes i don't believe
[01:46:11.280 --> 01:46:15.040]  in so i'd rather give that money to you and i'm getting quality products products i do
[01:46:15.040 --> 01:46:19.760]  receive have changed my life i mean the x2 has really done a lot for me i've lost weight
[01:46:19.760 --> 01:46:23.840]  my brain works a whole lot better i think my kids they use the toothpaste my son used
[01:46:23.840 --> 01:46:27.840]  to get these little sore throats and he puts x2 in water and drinks it and it gets rid
[01:46:27.840 --> 01:46:32.080]  of his sore throat well let me break this down for you i want high quality stuff in there
[01:46:32.080 --> 01:46:36.480]  i want a good price but i've kind of habituated everybody to where everybody buys when it's
[01:46:36.480 --> 01:46:39.920]  fifty percent off i'm making two dollars on the toothpaste fifty percent off and so it's
[01:46:39.920 --> 01:46:43.760]  the same thing like the fish oil or the turmeric or the bone broth thank you so much for the
[01:46:43.760 --> 01:46:47.920]  plugs but listen when people get the patriot points a lot of times it makes things a loss
[01:46:47.920 --> 01:46:51.600]  later because if you're already getting ten percent off because you're on autoship then
[01:46:51.600 --> 01:46:55.120]  we're doing fifty percent off and then you do something like that uh where you have patriot
[01:46:55.120 --> 01:46:57.280]  points we lose money but that's okay thanks for the support
[01:46:57.280 --> 01:47:03.760]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:47:19.520 --> 01:47:24.560]  show in kajmir once part of india stolen by the un and the globalist
[01:47:24.560 --> 01:47:34.320]  at the crossroads is now back under indian control just a giant geopolitical event totally
[01:47:34.320 --> 01:47:44.000]  authorized back by trump triggering you know what fits begins with s h dash t they're having
[01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:50.320]  crap fits right now the globalists are completely freaking out because they were supposed to
[01:47:50.320 --> 01:47:56.080]  destroy the world they were supposed to just absolutely have every nation at war with each
[01:47:56.080 --> 01:48:02.160]  other and and stealing people's countries what's not happening if people are standing up to the
[01:48:02.160 --> 01:48:07.520]  chai comms and standing up to others and it's all how serious this trade war is so the leftist
[01:48:07.520 --> 01:48:16.320]  media is like china sure showed trump that dirty crud creature china just sure showed trump why they
[01:48:16.320 --> 01:48:21.760]  just lowered their currency that'll devastate america's economy that'll show these trump supporters
[01:48:21.760 --> 01:48:26.800]  like bill mars said we need to plunge the economy and take these dirty americans how to behave
[01:48:26.800 --> 01:48:33.840]  that's on hbo and that's the final big piece of the equation when i say that the communist
[01:48:33.840 --> 01:48:41.360]  chinese owned the big six movie studios and they were trying to buy american bandstand studio that
[01:48:41.360 --> 01:48:48.640]  doesn't sound big it was the next biggest and trump got it said no no no no they're trying to buy
[01:48:48.640 --> 01:48:54.720]  everything but they've got control of hollywood the currency everything and trump's just this one
[01:48:54.720 --> 01:49:00.160]  sided deal for the globalist in america wanting to sell us out it's over and remember the chinese
[01:49:00.160 --> 01:49:04.800]  dictator right when trump got in two and a half years ago he went to debos it was the headlines
[01:49:04.800 --> 01:49:09.360]  with him with yonker and george soros saying we'll defeat trump and the american nationalist
[01:49:09.360 --> 01:49:16.160]  and their answer is to go on every channel and equate nationalism with shooting a bunch of people
[01:49:16.160 --> 01:49:22.800]  in a walmart in el paso as if that thing isn't synthetic as if that thing isn't like you're
[01:49:22.800 --> 01:49:27.600]  walking by plastic fruit at the mall and your kid walks over to get some he goes sun that's fake
[01:49:27.600 --> 01:49:33.920]  well how do you know i know fake fruit when i see it it's like hillary was having a town hall and i
[01:49:33.920 --> 01:49:40.960]  said those are all actors that looks like it's shot in 80 millimeter it turned out it was shot in
[01:49:40.960 --> 01:49:46.960]  80 millimeter digital and it was all fake people said how did you know that i know what 80 millimeter
[01:49:46.960 --> 01:49:57.520]  looks like star wars is shot 80 millimeter i know what um fake looks like it looks so crisp so perfect
[01:49:57.520 --> 01:50:04.000]  so had atmosphere dust in the air they had you know fog machines going she had a thousand people
[01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:10.000]  in a fake town hall that they shot for days and then put out as an hour long special that it was
[01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:14.240]  just so perfect they are no people didn't buy into it because it was so perfect
[01:50:15.760 --> 01:50:22.000]  weren't any flies landing on her there and you pull back and look at you want to spend 10 hours
[01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:33.120]  talking about el paso funny funny funny funny funny funny is what that's sick of beta aurora
[01:50:33.120 --> 01:50:37.040]  tanks have you seen the video where he's like cracking up laughing and i already saw us in
[01:50:37.040 --> 01:50:40.640]  other videos but i didn't play him because it wasn't as intense where he kind of goes
[01:50:41.280 --> 01:50:44.800]  he's such a psychotic so mentally ill so demon possessed that that they can't
[01:50:45.600 --> 01:50:49.680]  they're so lower level they can't help but celebrate and he's just like he's just like
[01:50:49.680 --> 01:50:58.960]  i'm so sad he's just like i mean it's so sick and so evil yeah it looked to me like he either saw
[01:50:58.960 --> 01:51:06.320]  someone in the audience that was in on a joke with him and it was like a dooper's delight like uh
[01:51:06.320 --> 01:51:10.240]  john actually shared with me yesterday or it was some weird thing where yeah he was like
[01:51:10.800 --> 01:51:15.680]  i guess excited about people dying and then being able to politicize it i mean that's
[01:51:15.680 --> 01:51:21.760]  really sick about this is how they just want to politicize it immediately and i keep seeing all
[01:51:21.760 --> 01:51:26.400]  these arguments about oh yeah this is the final straw like we got to get the guns now we got to
[01:51:26.400 --> 01:51:31.280]  do it now and i'm like wait a second aren't you guys the ones saying that trump is hitler aren't
[01:51:31.280 --> 01:51:38.880]  you guys the ones saying that trump is a nazi so that's a roark i mean if i looked at him in a
[01:51:38.880 --> 01:51:42.960]  criminology class i would say those are the features and behaviors of a true serial killer
[01:51:42.960 --> 01:51:47.760]  oh yeah i mean he runs off like i would not buy a car from him i would not golf with him
[01:51:47.760 --> 01:51:53.840]  i would not drink a beer with him i would literally say who is this child molester i mean he looks
[01:51:53.840 --> 01:51:59.920]  like a child molester and i mean i'm not saying he's a child molester uh he is a hit and run
[01:51:59.920 --> 01:52:04.560]  criminal and a bunch of other stuff but i mean this is this is this is scum this is a soulless
[01:52:04.560 --> 01:52:09.040]  maggot well and he's still gonna run he's still gonna keep funding he'll probably raise a couple
[01:52:09.040 --> 01:52:13.600]  more million dollars before his campaign uh shuts down even though the establishment put a hundred
[01:52:13.600 --> 01:52:17.920]  million at him even though zero percent chance to win they tried to rig the election he still lost
[01:52:17.920 --> 01:52:22.480]  a cruise and yet somehow he thinks he can beat trump no it's just a big money it's money it's
[01:52:22.480 --> 01:52:27.280]  money grab and you know it's pathetic alex these are the people that sit here in virtue signal
[01:52:27.280 --> 01:52:32.000]  oh let's help the less fortunate let's do this well how about let's take all the democrat funds
[01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:36.480]  that they've been fundraising for the last four years you have billions of dollars
[01:52:36.480 --> 01:52:40.400]  billions of dollars that could be going towards medicare that could be going towards homeless
[01:52:40.400 --> 01:52:44.640]  people that could be going towards better facilities at the border no it has to go into their pockets
[01:52:44.640 --> 01:52:50.400]  but it's beyond that oh and hundreds of thousands dead in mexico they never covered it but when they
[01:52:50.400 --> 01:52:56.880]  choose to cover it when it's one of their little plastic banana situations then they do it now listen

[01:57:15.840 --> 01:57:23.280]  david rockerfeller helped fund a Nobel prize research that in 92 these guys got the Nobel prize
[01:57:23.280 --> 01:57:29.760]  you can pull it up with their names two scientists one in anyone one in the u.s for science saying add
[01:57:29.760 --> 01:57:35.120]  barium salts limited oxide to jet fuel and then it would put these uh particles in the atmosphere
[01:57:35.120 --> 01:57:39.600]  to create nuclei to block the sun to save us from global warming now that's mainstream news they came
[01:57:39.600 --> 01:57:44.800]  out yesterday and smithsonian and said yes they're doing but but it's for our own good though we're
[01:57:44.800 --> 01:57:51.760]  ban him ban that man before i started working at info wars i was not only a fan of alex jones
[01:57:51.760 --> 01:57:56.560]  and info wars dot com but also the products at info wars store dot com and there's one product
[01:57:56.560 --> 01:58:01.680]  that's offered at info wars store dot com that is the elite of the supplements and that's dna
[01:58:01.680 --> 01:58:06.480]  force plus now i remember when alex first started talking about this with some of his special guests
[01:58:06.480 --> 01:58:12.240]  telomeres and telomere support with your dna and so i started to look into the science and what
[01:58:12.240 --> 01:58:18.880]  telomeres were and how it can improve your health and longevity when you protect your telomeres so
[01:58:18.880 --> 01:58:25.200]  i started looking into dna force plus but it's expensive why because it is an elite supplement
[01:58:25.200 --> 01:58:29.520]  and then i started seeing other competitors coming up with competitive supplements for
[01:58:29.520 --> 01:58:36.400]  telomere support and they came and they went but dna force plus is still there it is the elite
[01:58:36.400 --> 01:58:41.760]  supplement i get excited when dna force plus is on sale because i know it's expensive so you
[01:58:41.760 --> 01:58:49.200]  should take advantage of 50 off dna force plus at info wars store dot com let's talk to marcus in
[01:58:49.200 --> 01:58:53.280]  new york marcus here on the air thanks for holding hey alex yeah i just want to say uh your show is
[01:58:53.280 --> 01:58:57.440]  a breath of fresh air i talked to a lot of people here out in new york city and one thing i could
[01:58:57.440 --> 01:59:02.640]  tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars i think that the neocons are trying desperately
[01:59:02.640 --> 01:59:07.440]  to get trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in
[01:59:07.440 --> 01:59:12.400]  the eyes of the public the approaching 2020 that's it i mean if trump buys into this it'll be the end
[01:59:12.400 --> 01:59:15.840]  of his presidency it's the only way i think he could be defeated other than assassinating him
[01:59:15.840 --> 01:59:19.920]  it's time to be praying my friend i agree entirely and the last thing i just want to say alex is i
[01:59:19.920 --> 01:59:24.240]  know they're trying to shut you down but the reinforcements have arrived man i would love
[01:59:24.240 --> 01:59:27.920]  to see you on air until you're 80 years old i would love to see what you're talking about when
[01:59:27.920 --> 01:59:33.680]  you're 80 but if they do shut you down no you've gone into this war you've won a lot of battles
[01:59:33.680 --> 01:59:37.840]  and there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue we're
[01:59:37.840 --> 01:59:42.080]  going to keep fighting in the info war and even if something does happen to you or your show
[01:59:42.080 --> 01:59:47.040]  know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty thank you sir for calling
[01:59:47.040 --> 02:00:03.840]  you're listening to the alex jones show

[02:00:40.480 --> 02:00:44.320]  any plugs here on the internet we'll just we'll just leave it at that but you asked me in the break
[02:00:44.320 --> 02:00:50.640]  uh you know what inspired this so as you know i i came from sports media and it was really uh it
[02:00:50.640 --> 02:00:55.760]  was really you that kind of shook me out of that trance and changed my life and i wanted to pivot
[02:00:55.760 --> 02:01:01.520]  professionally from sports media to political media now here i am uh you know your right hand man
[02:01:01.520 --> 02:01:05.680]  it's been an incredible journey alex but so i'm from st louis and the st louis blue is actually
[02:01:05.680 --> 02:01:11.760]  won the stanley cup this year and so i've always you know i grew up going to sporting events and
[02:01:11.760 --> 02:01:17.200]  you know think about sports and and following sports stars and everybody always glorifies
[02:01:17.200 --> 02:01:20.880]  the sports champion right everybody always glorifies the sports champion they get their
[02:01:20.880 --> 02:01:25.360]  big moment in the sun they get all the coverage and i'm thinking you know that's great that's fine
[02:01:25.360 --> 02:01:29.120]  that's american tradition you know these are people that that you know obviously have what
[02:01:29.120 --> 02:01:34.960]  about what about supporting and and and amplifying those that are persecuted for standing up for
[02:01:34.960 --> 02:01:40.320]  basic freedom and so that was basically my motivation was you know i don't really idolize
[02:01:40.320 --> 02:01:45.920]  athletes anymore i don't realize i want to idolize the audience and and and all of us together
[02:01:45.920 --> 02:01:50.000]  the ideal that's what means idolize means that we want to build a better future and that's why i
[02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:53.680]  brought uh you know champagne for this whole crew and everybody in the audience can experience this
[02:01:53.680 --> 02:01:58.800]  too but alex uh i just wanted to celebrate you as a champion info wars as a champion we're all

[02:03:54.320 --> 02:03:59.520]  why the infowars audience is so key alex and this is why you know we celebrate this with them

[02:04:21.760 --> 02:04:25.440]  getting crazier i mean it's better than being tied up and having them sit on us you remember
[02:04:25.440 --> 02:04:28.640]  like a little kid when bullies would get you and sit on you and hit you for a while and it finally
[02:04:28.640 --> 02:04:31.680]  just felt better even though you were like five years under get up and take a break and smash it
[02:04:31.680 --> 02:04:35.280]  in their head i mean you know it's kind of the same thing well now you don't have to use a brick
[02:04:35.280 --> 02:04:40.400]  alex you pick up your censorship cup and you just you just ram it down the enemy's throat well
[02:04:40.400 --> 02:04:44.560]  i've always told them oh and if they're looking for a fight they're gonna get one i don't know how
[02:04:44.560 --> 02:04:48.720]  this is gonna end but it's a fight buddy and hey we're winning a spiritual level in front of the
[02:04:48.720 --> 02:04:53.600]  big guy it's the big judge up there the big umpire that's who we're doing this for amen
[02:04:53.600 --> 02:05:00.800]  Robert Barnes what has big tech become uh big tech are big babies that have become big bullies
[02:05:00.800 --> 02:05:05.200]  and the way they did so is because they face no consequence of social economic political or legal
[02:05:05.200 --> 02:05:09.600]  for their illicit activities over two decades and because of that that's why the courts the judges
[02:05:09.600 --> 02:05:13.440]  the juries the members of the independent free press that care about this the ordinary members
[02:05:13.440 --> 02:05:17.600]  of the public and the audience that care about this have to bring real social political economic
[02:05:17.600 --> 02:05:21.440]  consequence to their course of conduct otherwise they will never change and they will become the
[02:05:21.440 --> 02:05:26.000]  big tech oligarchs the equivalent to the big trust of the 19th century who ran american politics and
[02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:30.000]  ran american economy almost into the ground until we were able to recover after the great
[02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:35.440]  depression the informer's audience is the fuel that flames the the light of liberty across the world
[02:05:35.440 --> 02:05:40.080]  to make real the actions of independent free speech to make real the original promise of an
[02:05:40.080 --> 02:05:44.320]  independent free press real collusion is big back and big media manipulating and working
[02:05:44.320 --> 02:05:48.320]  with each other to try to meddle with elections to try to shake people's thoughts and then the
[02:05:48.320 --> 02:05:52.480]  whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening it's the ultimate form of gas lighting
[02:05:52.480 --> 02:05:55.840]  what you just saw isn't what you just saw even it is what what we just saw
[02:06:03.920 --> 02:06:13.280]  we now take you live to the central texas command center and the heart of the resistance rallying

[02:07:29.840 --> 02:07:34.240]  the unborn the born all are you standing up against radical islam all are you standing up
[02:07:34.240 --> 02:07:41.600]  to the left discouraged i salute you all right let's get back to the news here
[02:07:44.240 --> 02:07:49.920]  the last talks about how they care about these 20 poor people that were killed in el Paso and
[02:07:49.920 --> 02:07:55.200]  this weird story and local news and other news saying no the police still say they killed another
[02:07:55.200 --> 02:08:00.640]  guy and arrested somebody else and there were other shooters in full black and this guy only had one
[02:08:00.640 --> 02:08:09.360]  clip we can talk about that all day the point is statistically we know that hundreds of thousands
[02:08:09.360 --> 02:08:13.440]  of people have been killed in mexico by the drug cartels the media won't even humanize it
[02:08:14.960 --> 02:08:18.560]  and we know the left makes jokes about babies being killed after they're born
[02:08:19.840 --> 02:08:24.640]  and they want to euthanize grandma and they're doing all these evil horrible things but they
[02:08:24.640 --> 02:08:33.040]  know we have consciences good people so they tell us that oh white supremacist are everywhere and
[02:08:33.040 --> 02:08:38.000]  trump wanted to kill the hispanics because he said we had to have a border when the un and the
[02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:41.360]  globals are trying to collapse our border when people are trying to get out of latin america
[02:08:41.360 --> 02:08:48.080]  and get here because we're good compared to that we're good we're not bad compared to some of those
[02:08:48.080 --> 02:08:51.760]  other countries and the idea that they're drinking out of toilets they're in concentration camps
[02:08:51.760 --> 02:08:56.320]  and the border patrol is killing people is a damn lie and it's the terrorism
[02:08:57.600 --> 02:09:01.120]  it's the psychological warfare they're to sell us to fight with each other
[02:09:02.320 --> 02:09:09.280]  so i want to open the phones up at 877789 alex says 8777892539
[02:09:10.240 --> 02:09:13.920]  no one talked about the huge world war four that's begun now huge this is
[02:09:15.680 --> 02:09:17.600]  and what do you think the globals are going to do to strike back
[02:09:17.600 --> 02:09:23.920]  but it's an incredible time to be alive but i wanted to play this piece
[02:09:27.360 --> 02:09:32.880]  and by the way they made it four minutes long there's a bunch of videos that they didn't even add
[02:09:32.880 --> 02:09:40.320]  to this of people saying they kill babies for satan this guy that went in and shot his sister
[02:09:40.320 --> 02:09:45.040]  and all these people in Dayton Ohio the evidence is emerging now ap reports that he was the antifa
[02:09:45.040 --> 02:09:52.800]  and confirming what we said and then he was so angry about what happened in El Paso
[02:09:54.720 --> 02:09:59.280]  that he saw it as a tit for tat go shoot some white people as if those white people were
[02:09:59.280 --> 02:10:04.800]  doing anything to anybody just as evil as the other guy if you even believe the story
[02:10:06.640 --> 02:10:09.520]  but notice they're not hyping up Dayton because that's the real one
[02:10:09.520 --> 02:10:17.440]  but notice ap reports he loved it was a weird ap headline this morning i was reading it
[02:10:17.440 --> 02:10:22.000]  paul watched the story about it it's on info wars dot com where they admit
[02:10:24.160 --> 02:10:35.040]  that he was antifa and supported satan was the headline like who's writing those headlines
[02:10:35.040 --> 02:10:42.640]  that's crazy yeah that's the story from yesterday the story today is seeing an ap finally admit the
[02:10:42.640 --> 02:10:46.320]  Dayton mass shooter was a left wing extremist let's see if ap changed the headline i saw it
[02:10:46.320 --> 02:10:51.520]  like seven a.m this morning yeah scroll down and click on the ap link please and it says supported
[02:10:51.520 --> 02:11:00.800]  satan wow like he's a real person you gotta go to the article it says that he supported
[02:11:00.800 --> 02:11:07.600]  pro satan left us and he goes on to say supported satan see everybody knows man you

[02:13:27.280 --> 02:13:34.560]  out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby now you can say that that's okay
[02:13:35.280 --> 02:13:40.720]  and hillary can say that that's okay but it's not okay with me well that is not what happens
[02:13:40.720 --> 02:13:46.960]  in these cases and using that kind of scare rhetoric is just terribly unfortunate new york

[02:13:52.480 --> 02:13:57.680]  erotical expansion of abortion in new york state lawmakers approved a law permitting abortion
[02:13:57.680 --> 02:14:04.080]  in the state for any reason until a 24th week of pregnancy and then up until birth if a mother is
[02:14:04.080 --> 02:14:09.280]  in labor i can tell you exactly uh what would happen the infant would be delivered uh the
[02:14:09.280 --> 02:14:15.200]  infant would be kept comfortable uh the infant would be resuscitated if that's what the mother
[02:14:15.200 --> 02:14:20.480]  and the family desired and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother
[02:14:22.960 --> 02:14:29.040]  are you for third trimester abortions my answer to you is that that should be a decision that the
[02:14:29.040 --> 02:14:37.440]  woman makes uh there's scientific consensus that the lives of children are going to be very difficult
[02:14:37.440 --> 02:14:43.200]  is it okay to still have children how do you justify the decision to allow planned parenthood

[02:23:47.040 --> 02:23:55.280]  if just having mary Ann Williamson or whatever her name is up there talk about how we've got
[02:23:55.280 --> 02:24:03.360]  bad water all over the u.s the truth is you can't make the water clean at an industrial level
[02:24:04.720 --> 02:24:09.760]  they can't with all the runoff and all the drugs flush down the toilets and all the chemicals and
[02:24:09.760 --> 02:24:17.760]  all the stuff you cannot be in a big city and drink tap water that isn't dirty and poisonous as hell
[02:24:17.760 --> 02:24:24.560]  they can put a ton of chemicals in it to kill bacteria but the chemicals don't knock out the
[02:24:24.560 --> 02:24:31.040]  other chemicals there are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of allowable toxins in the clean
[02:24:31.040 --> 02:24:37.040]  water act the clean water act is only selectively enforced against businesses for fines and to
[02:24:37.040 --> 02:24:48.640]  harass industry it codifies and legalizes rate on and dozens and dozens and dozens of other
[02:24:48.640 --> 02:25:00.000]  radioactive isotopes that are naturally in aquifers in the old days they'd say why'd that town die out
[02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:05.760]  oh turned out the water was bad there's so many mining towns so many places around the world where
[02:25:05.760 --> 02:25:09.520]  it's a ghost town some of them are ghost town for a thousand years they say what made them move on
[02:25:09.520 --> 02:25:15.680]  well they found out there was uranium in the water people didn't know what it was but after a few
[02:25:15.680 --> 02:25:22.000]  generations everybody's dying at like 30 years old we better get out of here the wish doctor would
[02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:26.960]  say there are evil spirits in the water they didn't know what it was but there was an evil spirit
[02:25:26.960 --> 02:25:36.240]  all right people go like david hog the anti-gunner on c-spam he's such a genius he was ladies and
[02:25:36.240 --> 02:25:42.240]  gentlemen jones tells you there's poison in the water and then he tries to sell you filters and
[02:25:42.240 --> 02:25:51.120]  they'll go oh see they've never seen a straight shoot in their life they've never been talked
[02:25:51.120 --> 02:25:58.080]  directly to everything with them is manipulation and weasel behavior like gruber up there on c-span
[02:25:58.080 --> 02:26:03.760]  i teach the government how to lie i'm the there wasn't oh teach us you're so i mean who want would
[02:26:03.760 --> 02:26:07.920]  want to be around these people but that's just taken over and because we've been asleep these
[02:26:07.920 --> 02:26:14.560]  people have all gotten the power well see i don't sit around in my office about how to screw somebody
[02:26:14.560 --> 02:26:20.240]  over how to deceive or how to manipulate i just go i'm a straight shoot everybody and that's how
[02:26:20.240 --> 02:26:25.040]  our audience is i would call our audience amazing straight shooters who just want a straight shoot
[02:26:26.240 --> 02:26:30.800]  so yeah i want to fund this operation i want to bring in a ton of money instead of having to
[02:26:30.800 --> 02:26:38.640]  constantly scrape and scratch and cut and do so many things and we've had to hire security not
[02:26:38.640 --> 02:26:43.200]  complaining we had to do all our own bandwidth all our own servers they took our sponsors away
[02:26:43.200 --> 02:26:46.800]  they wouldn't let us advertise online they take our software away they kick us off everything you
[02:26:46.800 --> 02:26:53.200]  know what they've done but it really is something we should chronicle sometime for an hour take an
[02:26:53.200 --> 02:26:58.800]  hour to go over it all take a day to remember it all don't know i'm sitting around with a crew
[02:26:58.800 --> 02:27:02.800]  they're like man you ought to do a whole show and what we've been through it's just insane how
[02:27:02.800 --> 02:27:09.200]  authoritarian this is but what i'm getting at is this we're winning and there's not just evil in
[02:27:09.200 --> 02:27:14.080]  the world but we've got to hold the course but our audience is awesome but i know the majority of you
[02:27:14.080 --> 02:27:19.040]  have never gone and gotten some fluoride free toothpaste superboy never gone and gotten the
[02:27:19.040 --> 02:27:22.800]  lake of america coffee you've never gone and gotten fish oil you've never gotten our great protein bars
[02:27:22.800 --> 02:27:28.240]  that i'll be honest with you i went to a we went and looked like five or six of the top makers of
[02:27:28.240 --> 02:27:37.440]  organic bars and i said i said i want no fillers and they said listen people do fillers for the
[02:27:37.440 --> 02:27:41.920]  taste it's not just for the cost but you're gonna increase your price 20 30 percent or more
[02:27:41.920 --> 02:27:46.640]  with no fillers and a lot of people love it that it's almost like toffee and takes 10 minutes to eat
[02:27:46.640 --> 02:27:53.840]  one um they taste great but i'll be i just i'll like i'll like to just pitch the truth i'll tell
[02:27:53.840 --> 02:27:58.320]  you i i think i'm gonna put one out that's got some basic filler in it a little bit of corn or
[02:27:58.320 --> 02:28:02.560]  something because you know you want to go kind of eat it but i guess i'm a little piggy i've grown
[02:28:02.560 --> 02:28:07.680]  up on things with fillers it takes 10 minutes to eat one of these and it tastes great it takes like
[02:28:07.680 --> 02:28:13.840]  really rich toffee but there's nothing but high quality stuff in this because i went out and said
[02:28:14.880 --> 02:28:18.960]  i want the highest end they said well the highest end sell for seven bucks there's probably
[02:28:19.760 --> 02:28:25.040]  two dollars a product in it and i said okay i want to up that and i don't want any fillers
[02:28:26.240 --> 02:28:31.680]  and they said well everything has fillers because people are you no no filler so it's like a block
[02:28:31.680 --> 02:28:36.640]  basically might as well get like a knife like fudge but it's thicker than fudge and we got them
[02:28:36.640 --> 02:28:42.000]  in two different flavors they're great infowarstore.com you get something you need doesn't have any fillers

[02:30:01.040 --> 02:30:05.120]  gonna kind of reboot all our supplements in that if you go back five six years ago before all the
[02:30:05.120 --> 02:30:09.280]  censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits the rest of it i would talk about how great the products
[02:30:09.280 --> 02:30:13.120]  are and how they were the best and why they were and i'd have doctors on an experts to explain why
[02:30:13.120 --> 02:30:17.280]  they were so good and instead the last few years i'm like hey we need to really support us or they'll
[02:30:17.280 --> 02:30:20.400]  shut us down the biggest thing people like to buy is supplements because they know how great they are
[02:30:20.400 --> 02:30:25.360]  and how wonderful they work and the left always has headlines everywhere jones sells unapproved
[02:30:25.360 --> 02:30:31.760]  supplements that he claims are supplements no under federal law since 1996 you can't say that a
[02:30:31.760 --> 02:30:35.760]  supplement has been through the FDA because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it but then
[02:30:35.760 --> 02:30:40.080]  they say you've got to say it's not approved by them and all drugs are is the system trying to
[02:30:40.080 --> 02:30:44.000]  tweak what's in mother nature and manipulate it and do different things and a lot of drugs work
[02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:48.400]  great they have side effects not with mother nature but big pharma doesn't want you knowing about
[02:30:48.400 --> 02:30:55.040]  god's medicine chest info or store dot com or triple eight two five three three one three nine

[02:31:51.520 --> 02:31:55.360]  info wars the most banned network in the world
[02:31:56.480 --> 02:32:02.400]  george arwell said that in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act
[02:32:02.400 --> 02:32:07.040]  and so used to it wasn't that important to wear the american flag because we still loved our country
[02:32:07.040 --> 02:32:11.680]  and there wasn't a large group of people that actually hated it but now they're trying to take
[02:32:11.680 --> 02:32:16.000]  it out of schools they're taking it down off of government buildings weird white leftist that
[02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:20.880]  one of virtually singular pulling down american flags and running up mexican flags this is the
[02:32:20.880 --> 02:32:25.760]  bizarreness of the america hating we're seeing so now it is a revolutionary act at the time of
[02:32:25.760 --> 02:32:31.040]  incredible deceit and oppression and bullying to wear the american flag particularly the betsy
[02:32:31.040 --> 02:32:36.720]  ross anti-slavery flag and particularly when it says on the back right there ladies and gentlemen
[02:32:36.720 --> 02:32:42.720]  america's back info wars dot com so whatever you do take action today and exercise your free
[02:32:42.720 --> 02:32:47.440]  speech in these bullies face all over not just the u.s but worldwide because more than ever
[02:32:47.440 --> 02:33:03.360]  the american flag is a symbol of freedom against globalism you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:33:17.440 --> 02:33:28.160]  all right i'm going to write your phone calls but first i want to say this this is not a plug
[02:33:28.160 --> 02:33:33.200]  this is a clarification because i don't do a lot of marketing research around here they just come
[02:33:33.200 --> 02:33:38.240]  and show me numbers i told you last week when they talked about the water being poisonous all over
[02:33:38.240 --> 02:33:43.760]  the country that we had record sales of water filters well i just plugged and they came in and
[02:33:43.760 --> 02:33:52.480]  told me no as of 15 minutes ago all alexa pure is sold out pro pure is just as good they're all
[02:33:52.480 --> 02:33:57.040]  apples and oranges like this one will take out 300 and something chemicals to non-detectable
[02:33:57.040 --> 02:34:02.160]  levels and then this one does 300 and something but not all the same ones it's all apples and oranges
[02:34:02.160 --> 02:34:09.920]  you're reducing this stuff down to where it's not even parts per million okay and a lot and hundreds
[02:34:09.920 --> 02:34:15.120]  of chemicals it just cuts out and again these have all been tested we have the links to all the testing
[02:34:17.040 --> 02:34:22.400]  but the alexa pure is sold out so you want to get the pro pure systems that are very very similar
[02:34:22.400 --> 02:34:26.720]  and are excellent as well at info morestore.com but when i was telling you that it's selling out i
[02:34:26.720 --> 02:34:30.720]  didn't i don't just do that as a gimmick oh it's selling out better get yours when we're selling
[02:34:30.720 --> 02:34:36.320]  out of something i'll tell you we just sold more water filters than we usually sell in a month in
[02:34:36.320 --> 02:34:42.800]  a couple days it's still not getting us a lot of funding because we discount them so much that we're
[02:34:42.800 --> 02:34:48.400]  making like 30 bucks on them because i do undercut everybody in the industry it's it's it's what i do
[02:34:48.400 --> 02:34:53.760]  i just can't help myself so i even undercut myself because i put myself in this corner where people
[02:34:53.760 --> 02:34:58.800]  only buy stuff when it's 50 off now oh and let me explain we don't sell these protein bars for seven
[02:34:58.800 --> 02:35:04.320]  dollars a piece there are ones that have as many ingredients in it that are costing them a couple
[02:35:04.320 --> 02:35:09.840]  bucks that are sold at major stores everywhere and camping supply places for six seven dollars a piece
[02:35:10.800 --> 02:35:14.880]  these things are normally when you get a box of 12 of them three dollars a piece when they're discounted
[02:35:16.560 --> 02:35:21.440]  there's almost no in fact sometimes we lose money is what i'm saying and i don't know i've
[02:35:21.440 --> 02:35:28.400]  gotten myself into this position we sell a ton of stuff because we sell it for so low but
[02:35:29.520 --> 02:35:32.560]  then we're not getting the funding we need and that's why i'm kind of harping on funding
[02:35:32.560 --> 02:35:36.960]  because i didn't plug the first hour when i was talking to timber jay and he's i was in his office
[02:35:36.960 --> 02:35:40.960]  he said listen man you've got to cut new ads and you've got to start plugging just little quick
[02:35:40.960 --> 02:35:45.200]  plugs every segment like everybody else does can you just do it because we brought in a bunch of
[02:35:45.200 --> 02:35:50.160]  money last week but it didn't make up for what we lost in the last six seven months so you want
[02:35:50.160 --> 02:35:56.240]  to launch these initiatives get in there and tell people dammit because i've told him to get on my
[02:35:56.240 --> 02:36:00.720]  butt about this stuff because i'll just forget and won't plug for two or three days so thank you all
[02:36:00.720 --> 02:36:04.240]  for the support please support our local amen FM stations as well but you know they're trying to
[02:36:04.240 --> 02:36:10.400]  shut us down so yes go get water filtration get air filtration get all of it and i get it you
[02:36:10.400 --> 02:36:16.720]  wait till it's on sale because we don't sell anything now unless it's on sale but then when it's on
[02:36:16.720 --> 02:36:21.680]  sale we're not making a lot of money i'm telling you bring in 30 million dollars you got like 10
[02:36:21.680 --> 02:36:25.280]  million to work with that sounds like a lot of money it's not running an operation like this we
[02:36:25.280 --> 02:36:34.320]  can't do it and i'm not bitching i'm just saying we can't let them win go buy products
[02:36:36.160 --> 02:36:39.920]  i've not been able to work my phone though i'm not been able to really get anything done
[02:36:39.920 --> 02:36:55.600]  today because i've been so wound up and i said i'll go to your calls it's just that
[02:36:56.240 --> 02:36:58.240]  you're not going to hear a lot about what's going on
[02:37:00.640 --> 02:37:01.760]  because it's so big
[02:37:01.760 --> 02:37:12.160]  that's all i can say is this what's going on is so huge that i can't even get my brain around
[02:37:12.160 --> 02:37:20.000]  every angle of it and so i'm on air right now but i'm not here i my brain is just constantly
[02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:24.880]  going about geopolitical moves what trump's doing the different power structure is how
[02:37:24.880 --> 02:37:30.960]  they're going to strike back and it's just so historical the whole world government system
[02:37:30.960 --> 02:37:34.240]  set up by the globalist and the rock of fellers is falling apart
[02:37:35.520 --> 02:37:39.120]  they're pulling out all the stops with the chai comms the media trying to cause a civil war
[02:37:42.160 --> 02:37:45.920]  the media really is the enemy of the people they're going to false flag themselves you know
[02:37:45.920 --> 02:37:57.120]  that's coming that's scripted and this cashmere thing between india and pakistan
[02:37:57.120 --> 02:38:01.920]  where china was moving in and taking over what was formerly northern india
[02:38:03.200 --> 02:38:09.680]  and trump green lit support of this this could easily go to nuclear war very very quickly
[02:38:10.640 --> 02:38:15.600]  we're not in normal political season you've got all these huge developments around the world
[02:38:15.600 --> 02:38:20.640]  in the south china sea in the middle east with iran and asia minor
[02:38:20.640 --> 02:38:28.240]  and that's all i could say is that we're entering the quickening point
[02:38:28.800 --> 02:38:32.640]  all right we go to your calls i promise we're gonna get to all of them paul wasis coming up
[02:38:32.640 --> 02:38:37.200]  we got jim john wallace justin david nathan dj and tim and that's all the calls we're gonna take

[02:38:53.280 --> 02:38:57.760]  well i need those prayers i really need them sir yeah well i uh i've been hesitant to call him a
[02:38:57.760 --> 02:39:05.440]  first time caller i've seen him work for donald trump uh 2015 2016 uh i ran a couple states for
[02:39:05.440 --> 02:39:11.360]  him during the primary and caucus campaign and just wanted to let you know that i'm worried
[02:39:11.360 --> 02:39:17.120]  about what he's doing right now with with talking about gun control you know i uh uncovered a real
[02:39:17.120 --> 02:39:22.880]  big infestation from the coke brothers in that campaign apparatus uh and part of the reason why
[02:39:22.880 --> 02:39:27.760]  i uh was let go from the campaign is that i did call people out like cori luandowski
[02:39:27.760 --> 02:39:33.600]  alan cob stewart jolly who i felt did not have mr trump at the time's interest the best interest
[02:39:33.600 --> 02:39:39.680]  in mind and i definitely see some of these same players or types of players in the administration
[02:39:39.680 --> 02:39:44.240]  now and you can just tell who's writing these speeches like the one uh i believe it was yesterday
[02:39:44.240 --> 02:39:51.680]  so i just want all patriots to you know let people know uh write in the president trump uh
[02:39:51.680 --> 02:39:56.000]  write into other patriots in the administration that they need to get rid of these coke brothers
[02:39:56.000 --> 02:40:01.040]  operatives that are oh absolutely because trump you know drew from the swamp because that's all there
[02:40:01.040 --> 02:40:05.920]  is they lie to his face and say one thing and then do another and it is true trump will go with
[02:40:05.920 --> 02:40:12.080]  different advisers ideas at certain times and it really is what he heard last uh if it resonates
[02:40:12.080 --> 02:40:18.160]  with him is what he goes with i talked to high level actually two people high level in r a one
[02:40:18.160 --> 02:40:22.720]  of them is is is is you know ted newton it's not a secret he didn't tell me i couldn't talk about it
[02:40:23.680 --> 02:40:29.680]  but uh he said look i've had talks with trump and you know he does these tactics where he says okay
[02:40:29.680 --> 02:40:34.640]  what do you want we'll we'll look at doing it and then polosi says i want to ban all the guns
[02:40:34.640 --> 02:40:40.400]  take everything except single shot and then that hurts the democrats and then they get nothing
[02:40:40.400 --> 02:40:46.160]  which is good uh we're done compromising so he manipulates them but i agree i don't like even
[02:40:46.160 --> 02:40:51.120]  giving lip service to it he should have said mexico's got 200 000 dead from the cartels this is
[02:40:51.120 --> 02:40:57.200]  terrible it's horrible well i decry white supremacism which he did uh but you know we need to find out
[02:40:57.200 --> 02:41:01.520]  who this guy is and the answer is you know more good guys with guns instead of going down the road
[02:41:01.520 --> 02:41:06.640]  that every time somebody does something wrong all of us have to lose our rights that's what i'd like
[02:41:06.640 --> 02:41:11.360]  to hear from trump right and i'll be the same co-cooperative that we got out of the campaign
[02:41:11.360 --> 02:41:16.640]  we're trying to tank the campaign and people like you and other patriots that got the word out the
[02:41:16.640 --> 02:41:22.880]  movement was too strong uh to where they couldn't sabotage like they wanted to i mean don jr would
[02:41:22.880 --> 02:41:30.720]  bring trump my videos where i was warning uh and uh it's it's amazing and exactly but this time
[02:41:30.720 --> 02:41:35.280]  they're trying to totally isolate him right and when i was in the campaign i was telling everybody
[02:41:35.280 --> 02:41:42.560]  i could hey we need to pay attention to info wars uh i work with roger uh paul maniford and and we
[02:41:42.560 --> 02:41:47.520]  were kind of the half the info was half i would say the patriot half and then this other half was
[02:41:47.520 --> 02:41:53.600]  co-brothers john mccain operative uh mich mcconnell operatives people like that and they're going to
[02:41:53.600 --> 02:41:58.480]  try to they're going to try to ruin him in 2020 and that's what they're doing they're attacking the
[02:41:58.480 --> 02:42:03.280]  base with this talk about guns they don't have the president's best interest in mind i was
[02:42:03.280 --> 02:42:08.240]  state director for illinois i took over a state director for illinois in a primary campaign and
[02:42:08.240 --> 02:42:14.240]  when i got there they had scheduled a rally at the ui c pavilion downtown chicago so let me do this

[02:47:39.440 --> 02:47:45.280]  but the truth is simple it's also complex when that sun is high and he's talking about
[02:47:46.080 --> 02:47:51.440]  the took my saddle in houston i broke my leg and santa fe lost my wife and a girlfriend somewhere
[02:47:51.440 --> 02:47:56.640]  along the way but i'll be looking for eight when they pull that gate and i hope that judge ain't
[02:47:56.640 --> 02:48:02.080]  blind this is all story about god and experiences and the bad things that have happened to you
[02:48:02.080 --> 02:48:07.920]  and the good things just add to who you are and you're not a victim you're a survivor you're alive
[02:48:08.800 --> 02:48:14.960]  and then you know this person he's singing about isn't rich but lord he's free which is the real wealth
[02:48:16.400 --> 02:48:22.880]  because he's out there taking chances in the real world he's a man instead of these people
[02:48:22.880 --> 02:48:27.360]  that run around virtue signaling all day and are totally phony and totally alone more statistics
[02:48:27.360 --> 02:48:32.560]  came out this week than i'm going to your calls millennials half of them in like communism same
[02:48:32.560 --> 02:48:38.560]  thing as last year surveys and 20 something percent of them 25 percent say they have no friends

[02:48:45.040 --> 02:48:53.040]  verge this signal and tell you how they gave or they did something these are undeveloped babies
[02:48:54.160 --> 02:48:59.760]  and anyone knows that a spoiled brat if not checked will turn into a criminal

[02:51:01.600 --> 02:51:06.400]  trump events other events elizabeth warren events it's all the same where the people
[02:51:06.400 --> 02:51:10.960]  start attacking any trump supporters that come and the police have to take them out and then the
[02:51:10.960 --> 02:51:21.840]  the men are going like like crazy people in a movie where they're like and that's who they are
[02:51:21.840 --> 02:51:29.040]  folks however this stuff works we're fighting people that love to kill babies after they're
[02:51:29.040 --> 02:51:36.960]  born but tell us we're all it's we all killed those 20 poor hispanics down in texas that we
[02:51:36.960 --> 02:51:43.360]  all did that but but they're all fighting to get here because we're so bad do you buy any of it
[02:51:43.360 --> 02:51:50.080]  do you believe any of it no speaking of that dj in main thanks for holding thanks for calling dj
[02:51:50.080 --> 02:51:57.040]  you're on the air great congratulations on your trophy it looks pretty nice the people
[02:51:57.040 --> 02:52:00.800]  just tuned in it's a joke for owen gave me a trophy remember there's new lizard every five
[02:52:00.800 --> 02:52:06.560]  seconds every second tell folks what happened i got an award for being the most band yeah it was
[02:52:06.560 --> 02:52:11.120]  it was pretty good i didn't see you drink any champagne out of it though so um you know champagne
[02:52:11.120 --> 02:52:15.760]  gives me a headache and i'm trying to not drink very much certainly not not at work you know
[02:52:16.880 --> 02:52:21.760]  okay so quickly uh the alpas are shooting i've been following it um i've been a listener all the
[02:52:21.760 --> 02:52:26.720]  way back since the ron paul chuck baldwin days where they tried demonizing patriots okay i see
[02:52:26.720 --> 02:52:31.520]  that happening all over again and i am with listening to mike i guess that you had yesterday
[02:52:31.520 --> 02:52:37.920]  i can't remember his last name my god yes mike adam he alluded to like a 9-11 type event okay
[02:52:37.920 --> 02:52:42.720]  and uh one thing that's bothering me the most is anytime you go and try to search for a timeline
[02:52:42.720 --> 02:52:48.240]  for the el Paso events you cannot find one but it's my understanding that 24 minutes before
[02:52:48.240 --> 02:52:55.120]  that happened they received the minifast though and the the uh the gunman was allowed to have his
[02:52:55.120 --> 02:53:01.680]  own way in the walmart for 20 full minutes get into his car drive two blocks away and then now
[02:53:01.680 --> 02:53:06.560]  they're reporting that he surrendered himself yes no no that's all confirmed in fact i should
[02:53:06.560 --> 02:53:11.520]  be covering this more it's just that india retaking cashmere is huge and this whole geopolitical
[02:53:11.520 --> 02:53:18.560]  thing is so big but all the local reporters and our the police are saying no we shot another dude
[02:53:18.560 --> 02:53:23.680]  we arrested other people they're just being told shut up now so this is crazy whatever went on down
[02:53:23.680 --> 02:53:30.800]  there we don't know what went on but this this this this we now know he went in there with one
[02:53:31.440 --> 02:53:37.040]  banana magazine that you couldn't do this with and he didn't have anything else on him
[02:53:37.840 --> 02:53:43.760]  he was wearing tan and black and no mask everyone says three to four men mask they could see the
[02:53:43.760 --> 02:53:49.200]  blue eyes on some of the men and these are credible videos of these spanish americans
[02:53:49.200 --> 02:53:54.800]  uh i mean you see him one of them is an army veteran a black guy and it's just very clear
[02:53:54.800 --> 02:53:59.920]  they're telling the truth about what they saw and so if i had the personnel if i had the money
[02:53:59.920 --> 02:54:04.160]  we'd have like three reporters that i would have to send on emissions like this immediately to
[02:54:04.160 --> 02:54:08.560]  investigate we don't have it we don't have the people um and i would be in el Paso right now
[02:54:08.560 --> 02:54:12.480]  talking to all the locals and ferreting this out because this is where investigative journalism
[02:54:12.480 --> 02:54:17.920]  absolutely must come in there's no transparency i read an article um regarding the transparency
[02:54:17.920 --> 02:54:24.320]  with ohio versus um el Paso oh oh listen listen exactly they're not that's what greg rees said
[02:54:24.320 --> 02:54:30.320]  a video on they're not saying correction that there weren't they're just expunging all the
[02:54:30.320 --> 02:54:35.440]  witness videos and articles and as you said ohio immediately showed all the footage showed
[02:54:35.440 --> 02:54:40.240]  everything why aren't we getting that here i think because if there was a second diamond
[02:54:40.240 --> 02:54:45.520]  he may have not shared the same ideology as the one in custody and they're again they're trying
[02:54:45.520 --> 02:54:51.040]  to demonize patriots like they did what was it nine years ago and i think with everything going on
[02:54:51.040 --> 02:54:56.160]  the world this could be the big push to you know violate the constitution i think it's
[02:54:56.160 --> 02:55:00.800]  it's really going to happen in 2009 no i agree and they want to blame trump and remove trump it's
[02:55:00.800 --> 02:55:07.040]  happening now we're going to go to more of your calls paul watson's coming up but i've absolutely
[02:55:07.040 --> 02:55:11.280]  got to air since you mentioned it the greg rees report next segment i'm going to play that it's
[02:55:11.280 --> 02:55:17.200]  only four and a half minutes long uh it's titled fbi takes full control of el Paso shooting but
[02:55:17.200 --> 02:55:23.840]  i want to go out to break with something i shot last night it's beto orork and him smiling
[02:55:23.840 --> 02:55:27.920]  he does this in other videos when he's talking about what happened so here is that report
[02:55:28.560 --> 02:55:32.080]  and then we will be uh right back with more of your calls and paul joseph watson
[02:55:32.080 --> 02:55:36.320]  on the other side please stay with us the video you're about to see is going viral
[02:55:36.320 --> 02:55:44.080]  beto orork is seeming like he's in glee talking about the massacre that took place saturday
[02:55:44.080 --> 02:55:50.880]  in el paso texas is truly sickening and i've seen in other videos basically shapeshifting he just
[02:55:50.880 --> 02:55:57.280]  can't control his narcissistic glee that he's finally back under the spotlight this person
[02:55:57.280 --> 02:56:04.320]  is polling at zero percent in the democratic field but there he is just trying to glom
[02:56:04.320 --> 02:56:09.040]  on to this tragedy to make himself relevant here is the shocking footage from different angles
[02:56:10.640 --> 02:56:14.320]  i'm incredibly saddened and it is very hard to think about this
[02:56:17.600 --> 02:56:21.280]  i'm incredibly saddened and it is very hard to think about this
[02:56:21.280 --> 02:56:34.000]  um but i'll tell you um el paso is the strongest place in the world
[02:56:36.960 --> 02:56:42.160]  there's a lot of injury a lot of suffering uh in el paso right now
[02:56:42.160 --> 02:56:52.320]  um i'm incredibly saddened and it's very hard to think about this
[02:56:52.320 --> 02:57:03.120]  um uh but i'll tell you um el paso is the strongest place in the world um there's a lot of
[02:57:03.120 --> 02:57:13.440]  injury a lot of suffering in el paso right now i'm incredibly saddened and it's very hard to think
[02:57:13.440 --> 02:57:26.160]  about this um uh watching that it's as if i've looked into a window that gives me a viewing to
[02:57:26.160 --> 02:57:33.840]  hell as if betua roark is a demon incarnate he just loves what's happening he just can't he just
[02:57:33.840 --> 02:57:38.080]  can't keep it from you because he's going to take your guns and once he's got your guns he'll have
[02:57:38.080 --> 02:57:43.200]  full power over your body because then he'll be the only one with the guns this is the poster boy
[02:57:43.200 --> 02:57:49.040]  for the democrats this there are thousands of ideologies out there hundreds of different
[02:57:49.040 --> 02:57:55.120]  political systems and most of them are funded by the globalist info wars is truly the tip of the
[02:57:55.120 --> 02:57:59.520]  sphere of the zeitgeist that's what a globalist are obsessed with it trying to shut it down
[02:57:59.520 --> 02:58:04.960]  i didn't invent all this i went and researched the renaissance americana and what really works
[02:58:04.960 --> 02:58:09.840]  for humanity and i'm simply trying to bring it back and lo and behold it's super popular like
[02:58:09.840 --> 02:58:15.360]  it's always been that's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately because
[02:58:15.360 --> 02:58:21.280]  we have the light in the dark of the night that sends chills at my spine so whatever you do continue
[02:58:21.280 --> 02:58:25.440]  to support yourself and info wars by buying the great products and info wars store dot com

[02:58:43.520 --> 02:58:51.840]  pilot yes i got a plug for the patriot points i get oh thanks i got $180 so far this year
[02:58:51.840 --> 02:58:55.760]  and i feel like i'm stealing from you i buy so much in the store because i mean i don't
[02:58:55.760 --> 02:58:58.240]  want to get that money to walmart i don't want to give that money to people who are going to
[02:58:58.240 --> 02:59:02.080]  donate it to causes i don't believe in so i'd rather give that money to you and i'm getting
[02:59:02.080 --> 02:59:06.800]  quality products the products that i do receive have changed my life i mean the x2 has really
[02:59:06.800 --> 02:59:11.280]  done a lot for me i've lost weight my brain works a whole lot better i think my kids they use the
[02:59:11.280 --> 02:59:16.080]  toothpaste my son used to get these little sore throats and he puts x2 in water and drinks it and
[02:59:16.080 --> 02:59:20.640]  it gets rid of his sore throat uh let me break this down for you i want high quality stuff in there
[02:59:20.640 --> 02:59:25.280]  i want a good price but i've kind of habituated everybody to where everybody buys when it's 50
[02:59:25.280 --> 02:59:28.960]  percent off i'm making two dollars on the toothpaste 50 off and so it's the same thing
[02:59:28.960 --> 02:59:33.280]  like the fish oil or the turmeric or the bone broth thank you so much for the plugs but listen
[02:59:33.280 --> 02:59:37.760]  when people get the patriot points a lot of times it makes things a loss later because if you're
[02:59:37.760 --> 02:59:42.320]  already getting 10 off because you're on autoship then we're doing 50 off and then you do something
[02:59:42.320 --> 02:59:45.920]  like that uh we have patriot points we lose money but that's okay thanks for the support
[02:59:45.920 --> 03:00:05.280]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:00:08.880 --> 03:00:14.800]  by the way folks it's a big leftist conspiracy theory that i use speed or i use cocaine because i
[03:00:14.800 --> 03:00:20.640]  get so excited i've been on here 25 years i haven't taken any of those drugs since high
[03:00:20.640 --> 03:00:26.320]  school i only took them a few times i hated them i didn't like them i'm high on life and all the
[03:00:26.320 --> 03:00:31.600]  incredible things that are happening and unfolding are so interesting how would you not get excited
[03:00:31.600 --> 03:00:36.400]  about them people go get excited about sporting events and people don't think that guy must be
[03:00:36.400 --> 03:00:42.160]  smoking crack he's excited well sorry i'm not excited about football i'm excited about my
[03:00:42.160 --> 03:00:47.440]  children and your children's future and when evil people are trying to take my life over i get pissed
[03:00:47.440 --> 03:00:52.800]  like a dog in the backyard barking at somebody breaking in the house why is the dog pissed that's
[03:00:52.800 --> 03:00:57.600]  where his master lives that's where the food comes from that's where the kids live that pack the dog
[03:00:57.600 --> 03:01:02.960]  on the head he knows but you're having everything you've got taken away from you and you think it's
[03:01:02.960 --> 03:01:09.600]  weird i'm talking to mainline people that i get angry this is normal behavior ladies and gentlemen
[03:01:09.600 --> 03:01:17.280]  normal behavior to them killing babies after they're born now they're just pushing and pushing and
[03:01:17.280 --> 03:01:21.920]  pushing and now they want to sterilize three-year-olds if they can convince their three-year-old
[03:01:21.920 --> 03:01:28.480]  they're another sex the sicko parents it's moon chowson by proxy okay we'll sterilize you honey oh
[03:01:30.320 --> 03:01:36.080]  you're say you're a girl you get a lollipop i mean this is sick you know parents having sex with
[03:01:36.080 --> 03:01:40.960]  their kids go to jail and they should but at least they're not chopping their balls off huh
[03:01:40.960 --> 03:01:46.880]  oh chop their balls off you you get a td show think about how sick these people are and you
[03:01:46.880 --> 03:01:55.520]  know what yeah i get ferociously high when i start thinking about it because my brain says
[03:01:56.640 --> 03:02:00.320]  go after these people that's what we're doing right here we're going after them
[03:02:00.320 --> 03:02:10.080]  and humanity's been asleep when you find you're awakening you're gonna be just like me
[03:02:10.720 --> 03:02:15.520]  and a lot of you already were awake before i was awake but i'm talking to those new listers they're
[03:02:15.520 --> 03:02:20.720]  the ones that matter for the prodigal son story the good son did everything he was supposed to
[03:02:20.720 --> 03:02:24.720]  and when the other one comes back in for 10 years took his inheritance blew it all was corrupt
[03:02:24.720 --> 03:02:30.400]  it was a joke in the city the son comes back says he's sorry the dad slaughters the best calf
[03:02:30.960 --> 03:02:35.920]  gives him all these you know but presence is so happy and the good son says why'd you do that
[03:02:35.920 --> 03:02:40.960]  for him i'm the good son he says how much you think i love you that just did all this for him
[03:02:40.960 --> 03:02:50.560]  we almost lost him gotta be celebrating that the fact that this loser is still our family
[03:02:50.560 --> 03:02:56.000]  i don't need to tell you how great you are you're already great you're gonna get everything
[03:02:58.560 --> 03:03:00.240]  that's what it comes down to ladies and gentlemen
[03:03:01.360 --> 03:03:04.240]  is that the prodigal sons are the ones we need to get they're the ones
[03:03:04.880 --> 03:03:09.520]  they're the lost sheep i said i go to calls but i'm a babbler
[03:03:10.160 --> 03:03:12.480]  tam in pencilvania thanks for holding her on the air go ahead
[03:03:14.080 --> 03:03:16.800]  hey how are you all sir welcome brother
[03:03:16.800 --> 03:03:23.440]  Alex one of the you're like you're like me my mind is is all over the place
[03:03:23.440 --> 03:03:27.360]  with all the geopolitical events and everything that's really going on i know i gotta be brief
[03:03:27.360 --> 03:03:34.480]  really pick one subject for you i was calling alex because i'm i don't know how to say this i'm
[03:03:34.480 --> 03:03:42.080]  very very upset with trump pandering with the shooting with democrats and the and the leftist
[03:03:42.080 --> 03:03:46.880]  on guns oh yeah it's very it's very very dangerous but but he believes it takes the wind out of
[03:03:46.880 --> 03:03:53.200]  their sails hey sir we had his opportunity and we're with us he did not move on national
[03:03:53.200 --> 03:03:59.520]  reciprocity and i i can't fathom why he did not it's so important to have patriots and armed
[03:03:59.520 --> 03:04:04.720]  civilians yet he says like no i agree we need all that these states look and still carry and when
[03:04:04.720 --> 03:04:12.160]  he's national uh you know right to carry we need reciprocity and you know a few months ago here's
[03:04:12.160 --> 03:04:16.640]  morgan he goes oh yeah we're gonna look at banning suppressors i mean he just is terrible on the
[03:04:16.640 --> 03:04:21.360]  second amendment no it's very very dangerous his sons are good because they're hunters
[03:04:21.360 --> 03:04:28.960]  trump is not a hunter he's a city boy and and and and and he just can't imagine that's his blind spot
[03:04:28.960 --> 03:04:33.280]  and i agree it's very dangerous thank you tim sorry about a time all right paul watch is coming up
[03:04:33.280 --> 03:04:38.480]  but i promise to go to wall's wallace justin david and nathan and then i've got this chemtrail story
[03:04:38.480 --> 03:04:44.800]  but but we'll see what happens uh just regardless this is an incredible time to be alive and amazing
[03:04:44.800 --> 03:04:50.080]  things are happening good bad and ugly remember they hope you don't spread the links will you

[03:06:04.240 --> 03:06:10.640]  defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's alex jones
[03:06:10.640 --> 03:06:27.840]  i've been meaning to do this report for months and for some reason there's always so much news
[03:06:27.840 --> 03:06:35.520]  i don't get to it and then i was watching this morning harris and smith the host of the day of
[03:06:35.520 --> 03:06:44.560]  the night show eight a.m and i was like wow they've done a full pr rollout and smith sonyan
[03:06:44.560 --> 03:06:51.440]  and reuters and science publications that bill gates is going to save the earth from
[03:06:54.160 --> 03:07:03.600]  all of these uh evil problems like global warming and that they're going to add barium salt and
[03:07:03.600 --> 03:07:13.120]  aluminum dioxide to the atmosphere to block the sunshine so that it doesn't come down here and
[03:07:15.040 --> 03:07:24.080]  burn the earth up now in 1992 a Nobel prize was won for this plan a decade ago children's textbooks
[03:07:24.080 --> 03:07:31.200]  in public school taught that chemicals are added to jet fuel and aerosol eyes to create nuclei for
[03:07:31.200 --> 03:07:39.120]  sunscreen for the earth to stop global warming but then if you or i talk about it they say it's
[03:07:39.120 --> 03:07:45.760]  insane it doesn't exist kind of like human animal chimeras or jeffrey eppstein and his elita express
[03:07:45.760 --> 03:07:50.000]  i wanted to just play this and then hand the baton to paul watson but document cam shut please
[03:07:50.720 --> 03:08:00.160]  chemtrails that's the lay term for all of this and there's zero hedge articles about it the
[03:08:00.160 --> 03:08:07.200]  particular one is the big article uh out of the one i wanted is the one out of smith sonyan today
[03:08:08.400 --> 03:08:17.040]  that i saw him covering you know i'm just gonna cover this tomorrow tomorrow will be the day
[03:08:17.840 --> 03:08:23.840]  it's never been the day but i wanted to go over particularly the uh smith sonyan article i saw
[03:08:23.840 --> 03:08:32.400]  let me see what's here now that's quoting at all that's the guardian forms i want the council
[03:08:32.400 --> 03:08:39.680]  on foreign relations report i dictated all this that's the new york times global research it's okay
[03:08:40.640 --> 03:08:46.640]  we'll do it tomorrow we'll do it tomorrow today is not the day and i also have uh
[03:08:46.640 --> 03:08:54.720]  uh brennan the former head of the cia admitting it all so uh you know what we'll do we'll play that
[03:08:55.680 --> 03:08:59.440]  this is brennan in front of the cfr a couple years ago when he was the head of the cia
[03:09:00.320 --> 03:09:05.120]  introducing that they could spray things into the air to save us the thing is we have the
[03:09:05.120 --> 03:09:10.000]  patents we know how it's working and this is how this whole industrial manhattan project goes
[03:09:10.000 --> 03:09:14.320]  they've got all these other big secret projects what they're doing to the vaccines what they're
[03:09:14.320 --> 03:09:19.200]  doing with the gmo what they're doing with the open borders all these plans have been set up
[03:09:19.920 --> 03:09:23.520]  and then later they come out but they don't want us talking about them
[03:09:25.360 --> 03:09:37.120]  ahead of them doing it so here's brennan another example is the array of technologies
[03:09:37.120 --> 03:09:42.160]  often referred to collectively as geoengineering that potentially could help reverse the warming
[03:09:42.160 --> 03:09:47.760]  effects of global climate change one that has gained my personal attention is stratospheric
[03:09:47.760 --> 03:09:53.920]  aerosol injection or sai a method of seeding the stratosphere with particles that can help
[03:09:53.920 --> 03:10:00.880]  reflect the sun's heat in much the same way that volcanic eruptions do an sai program could limit
[03:10:00.880 --> 03:10:05.520]  global temperature increases reducing some risks associated with higher temperatures
[03:10:05.520 --> 03:10:11.600]  and providing the world economy additional time to transition from fossil fuels this process is
[03:10:11.600 --> 03:10:16.720]  also relatively inexpensive the national research research council estimates that a fully deployed
[03:10:16.720 --> 03:10:23.360]  sai program would cost about 10 billion dollars yearly as promising as it may be moving forward
[03:10:23.360 --> 03:10:28.000]  on sai would also raise a number of challenges for our government and for the international community
[03:10:28.720 --> 03:10:33.680]  on the technical side greenhouse gas emission reductions would still have to accompany sai
[03:10:33.680 --> 03:10:40.160]  to address other climate change effects such as ocean acidification because sai alone would not
[03:10:40.160 --> 03:10:46.400]  remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere on the geopolitical side the technology's potential
[03:10:46.400 --> 03:10:52.080]  to alter weather patterns and benefit certain regions of the world at the expense of other
[03:10:52.080 --> 03:10:59.120]  regions could trigger sharp opposition by some nations others might seize on sai's benefits
[03:10:59.120 --> 03:11:04.480]  and back away from their commitment to carbon dioxide reductions and as with other breakthrough
[03:11:04.480 --> 03:11:09.520]  technologies global norms and standards are lacking to guide the deployment and implementation
[03:11:09.520 --> 03:11:16.800]  of sai and other geo engineering initiatives by the way that's the cfr on c span but you know
[03:11:16.800 --> 03:11:21.760]  it doesn't exist uh this zero hedge article links to the harvard studies and and bill gates
[03:11:21.760 --> 03:11:25.360]  want to do this this has been out forever the bill gates is behind it he's the chief science
[03:11:25.360 --> 03:11:30.240]  officer of the globalist obviously every condensation trail is not this going on but it is happening
[03:11:30.240 --> 03:11:36.240]  it is a program and it just shows how crazy all this is paul watson what do you expect the public
[03:11:36.240 --> 03:11:41.040]  to do i know you got a big raft of things you're going to cover as the giant pedophile rings come
[03:11:41.040 --> 03:11:48.080]  out uh as the world government comes out uh as the geo engineering comes out uh just how as as
[03:11:48.080 --> 03:11:52.560]  all this stuff the human animal cloning is all coming out now what's the public going to do is
[03:11:52.560 --> 03:12:00.080]  all this comes out well apparently alex they're all going to start eating insects this is now a
[03:12:00.080 --> 03:12:04.400]  not just a meme on the left this is now a lot of people on the right saying yeah maybe it's time
[03:12:04.400 --> 03:12:10.720]  to start eating insects for me because cows produce too much methane it's bad for the environment
[03:12:10.720 --> 03:12:15.360]  the washington post came out with a headline the other day we need to eat less meat should the
[03:12:15.360 --> 03:12:21.920]  government step in uh the owner of the washington post meanwhile jeff bezos has a new yacht called
[03:12:21.920 --> 03:12:27.440]  the flying fox which is worth presumably tens of millions of dollars so it's one rule for them
[03:12:27.440 --> 03:12:34.800]  another one for everyone else we're all going to be eating insects for our protein apparently alex well
[03:12:34.800 --> 03:12:38.880]  that's the thing there's nothing wrong with jeff bezos if he wants a yacht that creates a bigger
[03:12:38.880 --> 03:12:45.920]  economy economies of scale but if you've got all the hollywood people jet setting out to the google
[03:12:45.920 --> 03:12:51.520]  climate change summit and lecturing us we should eat insects it's the total elitism and by the way
[03:12:51.520 --> 03:12:58.160]  i know people that know leonardo de caprio and all these people um think about the fact that
[03:12:58.960 --> 03:13:04.240]  they all know it's a big joke behind the scenes it's all a sick joke to teach us that being poor
[03:13:04.240 --> 03:13:11.200]  is cool so they can fly around in jumbo jets by the way that is a nice yacht can we put his ocean
[03:13:11.200 --> 03:13:18.960]  liner back up yeah they actually did a study of how much co2 it would release for all these elitists
[03:13:18.960 --> 03:13:24.080]  to fly to that global warming conference in italy if they were flying from los angeles
[03:13:24.080 --> 03:13:29.440]  we're talking print uh prince harry barack obama de caprio katie perry all these celebrities
[03:13:30.000 --> 03:13:39.120]  came out 784 000 kilograms of co2 just to go to this google conference to talk about global warming
[03:13:39.120 --> 03:13:43.920]  of course they always bring that narrative back in summer when it naturally gets warmer because
[03:13:43.920 --> 03:13:50.160]  it's summer but when it's winter and you get record cold temperatures like we did in parts of europe
[03:13:50.160 --> 03:13:57.200]  back back in 2016 they say oh weather is not indicative of climate but it is for them in summer
[03:13:57.200 --> 03:14:02.640]  then it suddenly does become indicative of climate and they get to play their narrative out that way
[03:14:02.640 --> 03:14:09.840]  but now alex you've got greta the 16 year old autistic swedish child on her way to america to
[03:14:09.840 --> 03:14:14.320]  lecture you all about global warming so you've got that to look forward to all right well you're
[03:14:14.320 --> 03:14:18.560]  always so good on air i hate to end up cutting into your time there's just so much news we forget
[03:14:18.560 --> 03:14:24.240]  to get to and and tomorrow i've got the cfr reports in the smithsonian stuff now i just forgot
[03:14:24.240 --> 03:14:28.400]  to get this myself we're gonna have all this for you this is from the council and farm relations
[03:14:28.400 --> 03:14:34.880]  how bill gates is going to save us by spring aluminum dioxide and barium salts added to the
[03:14:34.880 --> 03:14:39.360]  jet fuel that the jet engines then spray out and create the chemtrails it's all admitted
[03:14:39.360 --> 03:14:44.240]  completely and we're still bad and we're evil and we're white supremacist as well and everything
[03:14:44.240 --> 03:14:49.840]  else that's a total bull uh so didn't happen till the mid 90s the compensation trail is dissipated
[03:14:49.840 --> 03:14:56.480]  in just a few minutes now they step there for hours because they have nuclei added it is all
[03:14:56.480 --> 03:15:01.040]  patented it is happening it is the corporations all in league together please don't forget without
[03:15:01.040 --> 03:15:07.760]  your support we will not be here ladies and gentlemen and we have the banniversary sale
[03:15:07.760 --> 03:15:12.800]  last week sales extended while supplies last 56 percent off all the supplements storewide
[03:15:12.800 --> 03:15:16.880]  free shipping double patreon points and this is the dog days of summer always the worst time for
[03:15:16.880 --> 03:15:22.400]  sales and we've been behind this year in our funding just to keep going and so i just thank
[03:15:22.400 --> 03:15:27.440]  you all for your support but seriously we need the funding you know if some globalists would
[03:15:27.440 --> 03:15:31.200]  give me a billion dollars to fight the new world order no strings attached well i would have
[03:15:31.200 --> 03:15:38.880]  commercial free but that's not how it works so please everybody infowarstore.com you are the
[03:15:38.880 --> 03:15:45.120]  folks funding it all those that watch it with summit.news and infowars.com takes over on the other
[03:15:45.120 --> 03:15:50.800]  side whatever you do please spread the word you are the resistance like for real like you take action
[03:15:50.800 --> 03:15:56.800]  the globals go down hi i'm dan pilla i started fighting the iris over 40 years ago when they

[03:18:52.480 --> 03:18:59.200]  straight adam before i started working at info wars i was not only a fan of alex jones and enforce
[03:18:59.200 --> 03:19:04.160]  dot com but also the products at info wars store dot com and there's one product that's offered at
[03:19:04.160 --> 03:19:09.920]  info wars store dot com that is the elite of the supplements and that's dna force plus now i remember
[03:19:09.920 --> 03:19:15.120]  when alex first started talking about this with some of his special guests telomeres and telomere
[03:19:15.120 --> 03:19:21.120]  support with your dna and so i started to look into the science and what telomeres were and how it
[03:19:21.120 --> 03:19:26.720]  can improve your health and longevity when you protect your telomere so i started looking into
[03:19:26.720 --> 03:19:33.200]  dna force plus but it's expensive why because it is an elite supplement and then i started seeing
[03:19:33.200 --> 03:19:38.480]  other competitors coming up with competitive supplements for telomere support and they came
[03:19:38.480 --> 03:19:45.360]  and they went but dna force plus is still there it is the elite supplement i get excited when dna
[03:19:45.360 --> 03:19:51.680]  force plus is on sale because i know it's expensive so you should take advantage of 50 off dna force
[03:19:51.680 --> 03:20:13.520]  plus at info wars store dot com you're listening to the alex jones show you found it the tip of the
[03:20:13.520 --> 03:20:26.080]  spear it is the alex jones show and now your host paul joseph watson we are alive and in this hour
[03:20:26.080 --> 03:20:33.440]  we're going to be asking the question was the date in ohio mass shooter a copycat event was it in
[03:20:33.440 --> 03:20:39.520]  fact a revenge attack for the earlier el paso shooting there are some indications which suggest
[03:20:39.520 --> 03:20:45.040]  that might have been the case given the authorities and certainly the news media who are not interested
[03:20:45.760 --> 03:20:51.760]  have yet to uncover any concrete motive behind that second shooting which occurred
[03:20:51.760 --> 03:20:56.560]  tragically on saturday night so we're going to be asking that question what we know for sure
[03:20:57.520 --> 03:21:03.360]  is that there's a climate of political extremism in america you have extremism on the right in
[03:21:03.360 --> 03:21:08.560]  the case of the el paso shooter despite the fact that he said his beliefs predated trump
[03:21:08.560 --> 03:21:14.400]  trump despite the fact that he had left-wing beliefs clearly in that he supported universal
[03:21:14.400 --> 03:21:20.480]  health care and universal basic income both of which are left-wing beliefs but of course he had
[03:21:20.480 --> 03:21:26.320]  a far right belief in that he thought america is being invaded by immigrants and his dark
[03:21:26.320 --> 03:21:32.640]  ghastly massacre was his way of striking back against that the situation in america though
[03:21:32.640 --> 03:21:38.800]  right now in the culture and in the media is that only one side disavows political extremism and
[03:21:38.800 --> 03:21:46.640]  violence if you're talking about the mainstream the center and one side doesn't there's a headline
[03:21:46.640 --> 03:21:52.480]  up on breitbart and there are several of these which i'm going to go through cnn nyt contributor
[03:21:52.480 --> 03:22:00.800]  wajaha ali pushes hashtag massacre mosco mitch about mitch mcconnell this is a new york times
[03:22:00.800 --> 03:22:09.200]  contributing op-ed writer and cnn contributor who expressed glee as hashtag massacre mosco mitch
[03:22:09.200 --> 03:22:12.800]  an apparent reference to mass shootings and saint majority leader mitch mcconnell
[03:22:13.360 --> 03:22:19.440]  trended on twitter monday and he even tweeted out the hashtag himself he said quote hashtag
[03:22:19.440 --> 03:22:26.800]  massacre mosco mitch is trending i still have faith in america now understand this hashtag was
[03:22:26.800 --> 03:22:33.680]  trending at about the same time that a bunch of far left extremists descended on mitch mcconnell's
[03:22:33.680 --> 03:22:40.000]  house and started screaming death threats as they were literally stood right outside his house
[03:22:40.720 --> 03:22:45.600]  and that story is upon drudge under the headline far left protesters descend on mitch mcconnell's
[03:22:45.600 --> 03:22:53.040]  home threatened to quote stab the mother effort in the heart and as you can see in this article
[03:22:53.040 --> 03:22:59.040]  they talk about wanting to do exactly that what i just said they talk about wanting to break his neck
[03:22:59.920 --> 03:23:06.080]  and ryan sabedra with the daily wire tracked down the facebook accounts of one of these people who
[03:23:06.080 --> 03:23:12.720]  was making these threats turns out just like the date and ohio mass shooter she is a big fan of
[03:23:12.720 --> 03:23:19.920]  illizabeth warren so again we have numerous instances where far left extremists are either
[03:23:19.920 --> 03:23:26.160]  calling for violence advocating it not disavowing it or tragically in the case of the ohio shooter
[03:23:26.160 --> 03:23:32.320]  which now even cnn and ap admits was a far left extremist actually going out and committing
[03:23:32.880 --> 03:23:40.000]  violence they had massacre mosco mitch trending while these far left antifa supporting extremists
[03:23:40.000 --> 03:23:46.320]  descended on his home we're talking about his breaking his arms breaking his neck talking about
[03:23:46.320 --> 03:23:54.480]  stabbing him in the heart screaming abuse at his wife this is the guy who's really quite ill right
[03:23:54.480 --> 03:24:00.240]  now he's recovering from sickness they brought their kids to the show absolutely disgusting
[03:24:00.240 --> 03:24:05.600]  clear case of harassment mitch mcconnell's just been suffering from polio whatever you think of him
[03:24:05.600 --> 03:24:11.920]  politically that is completely unacceptable to descend on somebody's house and start screaming
[03:24:11.920 --> 03:24:17.360]  abuse at them in the middle of the night and death threats especially in this era this climate of
[03:24:17.360 --> 03:24:24.560]  political extremism who on the left has denounced that it's barely even a news story meanwhile
[03:24:24.560 --> 03:24:31.440]  reza aslan calls for eradication of kelly and conway and trump supporters twitter says his rhetoric
[03:24:31.440 --> 03:24:37.680]  doesn't violate their rules of course it doesn't you can get up there all day and dehumanize and
[03:24:37.680 --> 03:24:43.280]  threaten people on the right and nothing will happen to you the guy who expressed his desire to
[03:24:43.280 --> 03:24:48.960]  put um baron trump in a cage with pedophiles nothing happened to his account so if that's
[03:24:48.960 --> 03:24:55.520]  the benchmark what can you expect at this point so he literally tweeted this is a former cnn host
[03:24:55.520 --> 03:25:00.800]  of course after today there is no longer any room for nuance the president is a white nationalist
[03:25:00.800 --> 03:25:07.120]  terror leader his supporters all of them are by definition white nationalist terror supporters
[03:25:07.120 --> 03:25:15.440]  that is over 60 million americans who he is calling white nationalist terror supporters the mega hat
[03:25:15.440 --> 03:25:22.080]  is a kkk hood this evil racist scourge must be eradicated from society he's literally talking
[03:25:22.800 --> 03:25:28.960]  literally calling for 60 million plus trump supporters to be eradicated from society i looked
[03:25:28.960 --> 03:25:35.520]  at this tweet the first thing that came to mind is if you replace trump supporters in this tweet
[03:25:35.520 --> 03:25:43.760]  with hispanics that quote could have been lifted directly from the manifesto of the el paso shooter
[03:25:43.760 --> 03:25:50.720]  this is literally a few degrees of separation from literal terrorist manifestos written by mass
[03:25:50.720 --> 03:25:56.720]  shooters and then he went directly after kelly and conway saying you are the depraved evil we
[03:25:56.720 --> 03:26:02.960]  need to eradicate then absolutely absurdly i think it was the washington times who put out an article
[03:26:02.960 --> 03:26:08.880]  saying that reza aslan had called for the eradication of kelly and conway he got back on
[03:26:08.880 --> 03:26:15.680]  twitter and said that's complete bs i never said that that was literally his quote so you've got
[03:26:15.680 --> 03:26:22.080]  people outside mitch mcconnell's house calling for his death you've got former cnn host calling for
[03:26:22.080 --> 03:26:28.800]  60 million trump 60 million plus trump supporters in america to be eradicated and you have this out
[03:26:28.800 --> 03:26:37.040]  the daily caller quack ween castro post names employees of trump donors he tweeted the names
[03:26:37.040 --> 03:26:41.840]  of employers of 44 san antonio residents who donated the federal maximum to president trump's
[03:26:41.840 --> 03:26:48.160]  reelection campaign castro whose district includes much of san antonio claimed the donors are fueling
[03:26:48.160 --> 03:26:55.760]  a campaign of hate that labels hispanic immigrants as invaders so he's literally doxxed these donors
[03:26:55.760 --> 03:27:01.680]  to the trump reelection campaign opening them up to the kind of extremist rhetoric and attacks
[03:27:01.680 --> 03:27:07.600]  that we've seen against trump supporters over the past two years plus this is the climate of
[03:27:07.600 --> 03:27:13.440]  extremism that the left is encouraging while they get up and grandstand and claim the moral
[03:27:13.440 --> 03:27:19.200]  high ground and wag the finger at people on the right for the actions of far right extremists
[03:27:19.200 --> 03:27:25.200]  even though every single time people at least in the mainstream of the right disavow violence at
[03:27:25.200 --> 03:27:31.680]  every potential turn absolutely incredible especially given the fact what we know now
[03:27:32.320 --> 03:27:37.680]  about the date in ohio mass shooter which was that he was a satanist that he was a far leftist
[03:27:37.680 --> 03:27:42.640]  that he called for socialism that he bought into this punch a nazi meme that he supported
[03:27:42.640 --> 03:27:47.760]  elizabeth warren for president motive remains unknown and in fact we're going to get into
[03:27:47.760 --> 03:27:55.840]  his potential motive or a potential radicalization point later in the show but national public radio
[03:27:56.480 --> 03:28:02.160]  says trump should have blamed himself for mass shootings they claimed today that president
[03:28:02.160 --> 03:28:06.560]  donald trump was responsible for inspiring mass shootings in the united states and the he ought
[03:28:06.560 --> 03:28:11.360]  to have acknowledged his culpability in his white house speech on monday did elizabeth warren
[03:28:11.360 --> 03:28:16.960]  acknowledge her culpability no because they will never ever draw attention to it when it's one of
[03:28:16.960 --> 03:28:24.880]  their far left extremists trying to commit the massacre remember james t hodgkinson back in 2017
[03:28:25.440 --> 03:28:29.840]  how quickly did that story disappear from the news he literally tried to massacre
[03:28:29.840 --> 03:28:35.360]  a bunch of republican congressman he was a left-wing extremist and a bernie sanders supporter
[03:28:35.360 --> 03:28:42.720]  but trump who the actual mass shooter said was not radicalized by and his beliefs predated trump
[03:28:42.720 --> 03:28:47.760]  now apparently trump has to acknowledge that he's directly to blame for this tragic shooting
[03:28:47.760 --> 03:28:52.640]  in el paso no that's completely absurd we'll get back in the next segment talk more about it info

[03:32:00.160 --> 03:32:05.600]  wars is it is the only network of this reach that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate
[03:32:05.600 --> 03:32:10.080]  sugar daddy that's not backed by some billionaire that's not being funded by a secret foreign
[03:32:10.080 --> 03:32:16.160]  government it is completely independent of all that it is an old school american 1776 style experiment
[03:32:16.160 --> 03:32:20.320]  in the expression of the freedom of press and freedom of speech that in fact the founders were
[03:32:20.320 --> 03:32:24.720]  so concerned with at the beginning of the country they actually tried to support and subsidize
[03:32:24.720 --> 03:32:28.880]  organizations just like this because this was the kind of press they wanted and then ultimately we
[03:32:28.880 --> 03:32:33.200]  now live in an era where they've mostly been co-opted by big corporations or billionaire sugar
[03:32:33.200 --> 03:32:38.080]  daddies who've been able to control and manipulate what news it views the person's allowed to have
[03:32:38.080 --> 03:32:43.200]  or express or hear and the info wars audience has broken through that they uh they are the bridge
[03:32:43.200 --> 03:32:47.520]  from the of founding to the modern age ultimate american democracy and freedom and that's why
[03:32:47.520 --> 03:32:53.120]  there's been an unprecedented onslaught of deep lifewarming defamation lawfare and libel targeting
[03:32:53.120 --> 03:33:00.240]  you you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:33:00.240 --> 03:33:14.080]  live from the info wars dot com studios you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:33:14.080 --> 03:33:22.960]  and now your host paul joseph watson the bottom line is this donald trump is not to blame for
[03:33:22.960 --> 03:33:29.360]  the al pastor shooting elizabeth warren is not to blame for the date in ohio shooting the cause
[03:33:29.360 --> 03:33:34.880]  of mass shootings goes far deeper obviously the blame lays with the individuals but if you're
[03:33:34.880 --> 03:33:40.960]  getting up there on television and on social media and endorsing in some cases are at least not
[03:33:40.960 --> 03:33:46.960]  disavowing political extremism and violence you do not have the moral high ground to talk about
[03:33:46.960 --> 03:33:53.360]  political extremism and violence of course they're not too keen about talking about the motives of
[03:33:53.360 --> 03:33:59.440]  the second shooting that happened on saturday night in datan ohio with this connor betz mass
[03:33:59.440 --> 03:34:06.720]  shooter because the narrative doesn't quite fit the narrative that they want to push headline cnn
[03:34:06.720 --> 03:34:12.400]  and ap finally admit the date and mass shooter was a left-wing extremist we told you this days ago
[03:34:13.280 --> 03:34:20.720]  but even yesterday nbc reporter ben collins got up on television and claimed that betz was quote
[03:34:20.720 --> 03:34:30.400]  more neutral with his twitter posts completely brazen lie he repeatedly retweeted antifa
[03:34:30.400 --> 03:34:36.800]  he supported fall f candidates he opposed trump he supported the assault violent assault of people
[03:34:36.800 --> 03:34:42.160]  on the riot that was all made clear two days ago they were up on television lying about it for 48
[03:34:42.160 --> 03:34:49.760]  hours they finally had to admit it because the weight of evidence was so voluminous even snopes
[03:34:49.760 --> 03:34:55.360]  who lie about everything even though they're non-partisan independent fact-checker they're
[03:34:55.360 --> 03:35:02.480]  far left at website even snopes had to admit it in a headline was datan mass shooter a self-described
[03:35:02.480 --> 03:35:08.480]  pro satan leftist who supported elizabeth warren they acknowledged that it was true again that
[03:35:08.480 --> 03:35:13.520]  doesn't mean elizabeth warren is to blame for the massacre and it doesn't mean donald trump is to
[03:35:13.520 --> 03:35:18.000]  blame for the el paso massacre especially when the actual shooter said he was not inspired by
[03:35:18.000 --> 03:35:24.720]  donald trump in his own words they kind of left that out the coverage did they but the question
[03:35:24.720 --> 03:35:30.880]  many people are asking about the date in ohio shooting is was it a copycat or was it a revenge
[03:35:30.880 --> 03:35:38.800]  attack for the earlier el paso shooting mike cernovich tweeted yesterday was the date in
[03:35:38.800 --> 03:35:45.120]  ohio terrorist attack far left-wing attacker a copycat of el paso we know shooter was glued
[03:35:45.120 --> 03:35:52.080]  to social media reading about el paso engaging with far left-wing content did reading the reports
[03:35:52.080 --> 03:35:57.920]  and radicalized violent rhetoric from the left make him snap and this is completely accurate
[03:35:57.920 --> 03:36:04.240]  before twitter suspended the profile of connebets the ohio mass shooter i went through his retweets
[03:36:04.240 --> 03:36:10.400]  went through his likes he was responding interacting engaging with news and with news outlets on the
[03:36:10.400 --> 03:36:16.880]  far left about the el paso massacre now if you read what his girlfriend said which i read in a
[03:36:16.880 --> 03:36:23.440]  separate article or his ex-girlfriend i think it was she said that she knew him well and that this
[03:36:23.440 --> 03:36:28.160]  was not premeditated that he would not have premeditated this attack and that it was apparent
[03:36:28.160 --> 03:36:34.720]  that it something had snapped which caused him to go on that rampage basically on a win what could
[03:36:34.720 --> 03:36:41.440]  that have been that caused him to snap was it the fact that he was on social media being radicalized
[03:36:41.440 --> 03:36:49.760]  by this brazenly acerbic rhetoric about the el paso shooting from far left-wing outlets like media
[03:36:49.760 --> 03:36:54.800]  matters like right-wing watch and others which is documented to have been on his twitter feed
[03:36:55.760 --> 03:37:02.080]  another headline which relates to this up on summit dot news pictured ohio shooter war and
[03:37:02.080 --> 03:37:10.320]  tifa mask and woman's dress so he was in a band which was kind of like a death metal band called
[03:37:10.320 --> 03:37:16.320]  menstrual munchies not too successful by the sounds of it and he was pictured during one on
[03:37:16.320 --> 03:37:23.920]  stage performance in an antifa mask and a woman's dress now this is a long report which i linked to
[03:37:23.920 --> 03:37:29.840]  in this article from death metal underground website robert de sanford so it's it's not like a
[03:37:29.840 --> 03:37:34.880]  christian website that just hates heavy metal and is trying to blame mass shootings on music
[03:37:34.880 --> 03:37:41.520]  it's by an actual death metal website and he reports that in a 2018 performance video posted
[03:37:41.520 --> 03:37:48.880]  to facebook betz don's address in a mask commonly worn by antifa members and as part of this group
[03:37:48.880 --> 03:37:56.480]  betz was part of a grindcore music scene that had vehemently embraced antifa since 2013 and could be
[03:37:56.480 --> 03:38:01.040]  quote responsible for the radicalization of heavy metal's first mass murderer musician
[03:38:01.840 --> 03:38:07.680]  he makes the distinction he's not blaming the shooting on heavy metal music but he makes the
[03:38:07.680 --> 03:38:16.240]  point that there is a subset within this genre of this death metal music which advocates for
[03:38:16.240 --> 03:38:22.320]  violence and killing of quote nazis incels and law-abiding civilians who happen to hold
[03:38:22.320 --> 03:38:27.440]  right of center political views that's what robert de sanford explains in his article
[03:38:27.440 --> 03:38:34.720]  being a part of this music scene he'd be in a position to know he writes quote anti fascism
[03:38:34.720 --> 03:38:39.840]  communism and other radical left-wing ideologies have been increasingly promoted within the
[03:38:39.840 --> 03:38:46.320]  metal community since about 2013 when a number of popular metal journalists began gushing over
[03:38:46.320 --> 03:38:52.880]  the antics of antifa and even started promoting their violence and in fact i've done videos on
[03:38:52.880 --> 03:38:59.760]  this before where these death metal bands openly embrace the antifa motif they literally wear the
[03:38:59.760 --> 03:39:07.520]  clothing during their music videos and the lyrics are all pro-antifa pro-violence pro-revolutionary
[03:39:07.520 --> 03:39:14.640]  very extreme fringe radical lyrics and this is not only what betz the ohio mashu to was listening
[03:39:14.640 --> 03:39:22.240]  to but it was the music he was creating before his rampage and de sanford goes on to note quote
[03:39:22.880 --> 03:39:28.160]  therefore it was not the music but an ideology that only recently recently permeated the music
[03:39:28.160 --> 03:39:33.520]  that's contributed to the date and shooters aggression and isolation now the other band
[03:39:33.520 --> 03:39:39.520]  members who were in his band say basically they've deleted all their music from youtube and everything
[03:39:39.520 --> 03:39:44.320]  because they're horrified by this they say they just got into it because they wanted to be edgy
[03:39:44.320 --> 03:39:50.320]  and rebellious he was actually into it because he believed the lyrics that he was singing and he was
[03:39:50.320 --> 03:39:57.440]  listening to in fact vice admitted this in an article headline date and shooter was in a porno
[03:39:57.440 --> 03:40:03.520]  grind band that released songs about raping and killing women the titles of these songs and the
[03:40:03.520 --> 03:40:08.400]  titles of these bands which he listened to i can't even read out on air because they're completely
[03:40:08.400 --> 03:40:15.600]  explicit but jesse creepbomb who was one of betz's bandmates is taking the recordings down he says
[03:40:15.600 --> 03:40:20.640]  he's removing them out of fear the vulgar music he produced will make a cult hero out of the murderer
[03:40:20.640 --> 03:40:27.520]  who was killed by police at the scene so of course back during columbine you had the culture blaming
[03:40:27.520 --> 03:40:32.320]  that mass shooting and some that followed on the music of maril in manson and people like that of
[03:40:32.320 --> 03:40:38.400]  course you've had violent video games being blamed for years not really any hard evidence to suggest
[03:40:38.400 --> 03:40:45.360]  there is a direct connection but this guy's own band member is now removing music because he sees a
[03:40:45.360 --> 03:40:52.880]  connection between that music and between the actions of this mass shooter in ohio so it seems
[03:40:52.880 --> 03:40:59.760]  that in addition to the left-wing radical motive that he may have had it was all encapsulated within
[03:40:59.760 --> 03:41:06.480]  this genre of death metal of which he was very much an integral member so authorities are still
[03:41:06.480 --> 03:41:11.360]  saying they've got no idea what the motive was he doesn't seem to have left behind any manifesto
[03:41:12.160 --> 03:41:18.080]  his surviving family members of course he tragically shot his own sister dead have no clue as to his
[03:41:18.080 --> 03:41:22.960]  motive the mainstream media isn't going to ferret out his motive because it's not going to look too
[03:41:22.960 --> 03:41:30.160]  good for them so it remains to be seen but more is coming to light day by day but it does seem it
[03:41:30.160 --> 03:41:36.720]  had something to do with this genre this pro antifa pro violence pro revolutionary genre
[03:41:36.720 --> 03:41:42.640]  within that subset of that death metal movement will have more on that as it comes out he also
[03:41:42.640 --> 03:41:48.000]  had this article up earlier study media fascination with mass shooters is creating more mass shooters
[03:41:48.000 --> 03:41:56.320]  this was a study funded by the u.s. department of justice which found and they collected all the
[03:41:56.320 --> 03:42:03.840]  data from every mass shooting in america over the past basically 50 plus years and they found
[03:42:03.840 --> 03:42:08.640]  that the more media attention the more 24-hour rolling news coverage that's provided to every
[03:42:08.640 --> 03:42:14.960]  mass shooting makes the next mass shooting more likely because it provides a body of research
[03:42:14.960 --> 03:42:22.320]  which future mass shooters use to not only plan their attacks but they're radicalized by it because
[03:42:22.320 --> 03:42:29.120]  they're attracted to this ghastly dark fame that's afforded to all mass shooters by the mass media
[03:42:29.120 --> 03:42:35.120]  by constantly revealing their identities their names and their motivations and their manifestos
[03:42:35.760 --> 03:42:40.720]  after the fact so the fact the media is so obsessed with mass shooters and gives it so much
[03:42:40.720 --> 03:42:48.080]  coverage unlike some of the european countries that don't is directly incentivizing future mass
[03:42:48.080 --> 03:42:52.320]  shooters so they have to take some responsibility for that we'll be back don't go away
[03:42:53.600 --> 03:42:57.760]  Robert Barnes what does big tech become a big tech are big babies that have become big bullies and
[03:42:57.760 --> 03:43:01.760]  the way they did so is because they face no consequence of social economic political or
[03:43:01.760 --> 03:43:06.080]  legal for their illicit activities over two decades and because of that that's why the courts the
[03:43:06.080 --> 03:43:10.080]  judges the juries the members of the independent free press that care about this the ordinary
[03:43:10.080 --> 03:43:13.520]  members of the public and the audience that care about this have to bring real social
[03:43:13.520 --> 03:43:17.760]  political economic consequence to their course of conduct otherwise they will never change and
[03:43:17.760 --> 03:43:21.600]  they will become the big tech oligarchs the equivalent to the big trust of the 19th century
[03:43:21.600 --> 03:43:26.000]  who ran american politics and ran american economy almost into the ground until we were able to
[03:43:26.000 --> 03:43:30.720]  recover after the great depression the informers audience is the fuel that flames the the light
[03:43:30.720 --> 03:43:35.840]  of liberty across the world to make real the actions of independent free speech to make real
[03:43:35.840 --> 03:43:40.160]  the original promise of an independent free press real collusion is big tech and big media
[03:43:40.160 --> 03:43:44.560]  manipulating and working with each other to try to meddle with elections to try to shake people's
[03:43:44.560 --> 03:43:48.240]  thoughts and then the whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening it's the ultimate
[03:43:48.240 --> 03:43:52.720]  form of gaslighting what you just saw isn't what you just saw even it is what what we just saw

[03:45:01.200 --> 03:45:05.360]  in that if you go back five six years ago before all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits
[03:45:05.360 --> 03:45:09.040]  the rest of it i would talk about how great the products are and how they were the best and why
[03:45:09.040 --> 03:45:12.960]  they were and i'd have doctors on an experts to explain why they were so good and instead the last
[03:45:12.960 --> 03:45:16.880]  few years i'm like hey we need to really support us or they'll shut us down the biggest thing people
[03:45:16.880 --> 03:45:19.840]  like to buy is supplements because they know how great they are and how wonderful they were
[03:45:19.840 --> 03:45:25.280]  and the left always has headlines everywhere jones sells unapproved supplements that he claims
[03:45:25.280 --> 03:45:31.200]  are supplements no under federal law since 1996 you can't say that a supplement has been through
[03:45:31.200 --> 03:45:35.120]  the FDA because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it but then they say you've got to say
[03:45:35.120 --> 03:45:39.680]  it's not approved by them and all drugs are is the system trying to tweak what's in mother nature
[03:45:39.680 --> 03:45:43.520]  and manipulate it and do different things and a lot of drugs work great they have side effects
[03:45:43.520 --> 03:45:48.480]  not with mother nature but big pharma doesn't want you knowing about god's medicine chest info

[03:48:49.920 --> 03:48:55.760]  garlic festival shooters white supremacy ideology despite social media posts so of course you had
[03:48:55.760 --> 03:49:01.360]  cnn and others pushing that narrative that the garlic festival shooter was a right wing white
[03:49:01.360 --> 03:49:07.600]  supremacist trump supporter the fbi says that that's wrong and they haven't found any political motive
[03:49:07.600 --> 03:49:13.200]  for that shooting yet so another correction another thing that the media got wrong about these mass
[03:49:13.200 --> 03:49:19.760]  shootings meanwhile people are asking why we seem to have more of these mass shootings at least
[03:49:19.760 --> 03:49:25.600]  they're becoming more deadly if not more regular in number and then a couple of interesting surveys
[03:49:25.600 --> 03:49:32.480]  came out of the past few days one of which is headlined at summit dot news poll 89 percent of
[03:49:32.480 --> 03:49:38.720]  uk gen z is say their lives are meaningless we've asked them at the question many times
[03:49:39.440 --> 03:49:44.960]  is the increasing alienation alienation and atomization of young men specifically young
[03:49:44.960 --> 03:49:51.200]  white men who are blamed by society and culture for basically every historical and modern ill with
[03:49:51.200 --> 03:49:58.320]  the world is that being driven by social media is it being driven by this increasing atomization of
[03:49:58.320 --> 03:50:04.560]  society the loss of faith the desecration of the family unit well a new poll out the uk
[03:50:05.520 --> 03:50:12.560]  reveals that a staggering 89 percent of young people aged 18 to 29 feel their lives are meaningless
[03:50:12.560 --> 03:50:17.840]  and without purpose a further 30 percent of respondents in this poll young people
[03:50:17.840 --> 03:50:24.240]  so they're stuck in a rut while 84 percent saying they're failing to live their best life
[03:50:25.440 --> 03:50:30.880]  people are more depressed than ever now is that simply because the pharmaceutical industry is
[03:50:31.440 --> 03:50:38.960]  categorizing unhappiness as something far worse and throwing pills at it to make money or is it
[03:50:38.960 --> 03:50:45.600]  because people are actually feeling more nihilistic and have less purpose in their lives the article
[03:50:45.600 --> 03:50:50.240]  continues one of the primary reasons cited for failing to achieve happiness and purpose
[03:50:50.240 --> 03:50:56.560]  is a lack of finances according to 45 percent of respondents of course we have wage stagnation
[03:50:56.560 --> 03:51:02.720]  across the western world and basically a quality of life that is in decline for the increasing
[03:51:02.720 --> 03:51:08.480]  amount of hours that people have to work to make the same money with interest rates and especially
[03:51:09.200 --> 03:51:13.440]  if you talk about in the uk property prices which in many and many areas are completely
[03:51:13.440 --> 03:51:18.960]  unaffordable for young people so they get stuck in this cycle of debt and then that makes them more
[03:51:18.960 --> 03:51:26.000]  depressed the survey conducted by yakkel uk found that 80 percent of people across all age ranges
[03:51:26.000 --> 03:51:31.360]  felt they were living without purpose but that number drops as 55 percent for people over the age
[03:51:31.360 --> 03:51:37.120]  of 60 of course more of whom are probably going to church and have faith in their life which
[03:51:38.080 --> 03:51:42.320]  a big correlation between the drop in church attendance and the drop in religion and the
[03:51:42.320 --> 03:51:51.120]  increase in nihilism and depression may be a connection there another headline survey almost
[03:51:51.120 --> 03:51:56.080]  a quarter of millennials say they have no friends a new survey reveals almost a quarter of millennials
[03:51:56.080 --> 03:52:03.040]  say they have no friends while 30 percent say they are always or often lonely so aged between
[03:52:03.040 --> 03:52:10.240]  23 and 38 surveyed by you gov people in that age bracket 22 percent of millennials said they had no
[03:52:10.240 --> 03:52:16.800]  friends while less than a third said they have at least 10 friends 27 percent of millennials
[03:52:16.800 --> 03:52:24.640]  said they had no close friends while 22 percent of gen X's said the same so despite the onset of
[03:52:24.640 --> 03:52:31.680]  easy mass communication with text messaging with mobile phones with skype with whatever it seems
[03:52:31.680 --> 03:52:38.080]  people are only growing more distant and becoming more atomized because those threads of society
[03:52:38.080 --> 03:52:43.440]  especially with the church and the family are becoming increasingly frayed so despite the ease
[03:52:43.440 --> 03:52:49.360]  of mass communication people are feeling more lonely than ever before and more depressed than
[03:52:49.360 --> 03:52:57.120]  ever before it seems which is why I would offer some of them on the fringe the ones who are prone
[03:52:57.120 --> 03:53:03.200]  to mental illness and prone to lash out in violence many of them on SSRI drugs are indeed doing that
[03:53:03.200 --> 03:53:09.360]  which is why you see an increase in mass shootings or an apparent increase at least in the severity
[03:53:09.360 --> 03:53:16.000]  of them that statistic is often debated back and forth switching gears though
[03:53:17.440 --> 03:53:23.360]  RT reports the Guardian apologizes for saying Sputnik posted fake Notre Dame photo vilifying
[03:53:23.360 --> 03:53:29.920]  Muslims so you remember back in April I think it was when the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris caught
[03:53:29.920 --> 03:53:39.520]  fire just an accident I put out an article and indeed a video because I went on Al Jazeera Facebook
[03:53:39.520 --> 03:53:45.680]  and France 24 Facebook and I was tracking the reactions of people on those Facebook pages
[03:53:45.680 --> 03:53:52.320]  to the live video of Notre Dame Cathedral burning down and what did I see what did I
[03:53:52.320 --> 03:53:59.760]  document in screenshots the fact that the fire in the cathedral was being celebrated by lots of
[03:53:59.760 --> 03:54:07.440]  people with Arabic names from certain parts of the world this was a fact and Buzzfeed the same
[03:54:07.440 --> 03:54:13.200]  day claimed that came out and claimed that I was engaging in a giant hoax in fact they claimed
[03:54:13.840 --> 03:54:21.040]  that the video I posted of the Notre Dame Cathedral burning with these Arabic people in the comments
[03:54:21.040 --> 03:54:26.400]  celebrating it giving it hearts giving it thumbs up saying al-arabar they said oh we don't know
[03:54:26.400 --> 03:54:32.800]  what they were reacting to when the cathedral is in the background of the video burning down
[03:54:33.520 --> 03:54:37.600]  so Buzzfeed tried to put out this hit piece claiming that I'd made it up that all these people
[03:54:37.600 --> 03:54:43.040]  were celebrating and that they weren't even reacting to the fire in the cathedral complete
[03:54:43.040 --> 03:54:50.880]  fake news which I debunked vehemently at the time well now RT reports the Guardian has issued a
[03:54:50.880 --> 03:54:56.000]  mealy-mouthed apology for accusing Russian news agency Sputnik of doctoring images in the media
[03:54:56.000 --> 03:55:01.760]  aftermath of the Notre Dame fire to perpetuate an anti-Muslim narrative online and it took them
[03:55:01.760 --> 03:55:07.920]  four months to apologize so you'll probably some of you remember this picture which shows a couple
[03:55:07.920 --> 03:55:15.280]  of Middle Eastern looking men around the area of Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris they're leaving a
[03:55:15.280 --> 03:55:21.120]  what looks like a security or emergency cordon that's being placed on the road next to the cathedral
[03:55:21.680 --> 03:55:28.320]  and both of them are smiling quite happily as the cathedral burns down in the background
[03:55:29.600 --> 03:55:35.680]  now Sputnik put this photo out it was I think it was Getty Images original photo and then the
[03:55:35.680 --> 03:55:41.280]  Guardian and other news outlets on the left came out and claimed that it was a photoshopped image
[03:55:41.280 --> 03:55:48.560]  it wasn't a photoshopped image it was completely authentic in an episode of fake or for real
[03:55:48.560 --> 03:55:54.160]  published on 19th of April this is the apology that the Guardian had to put out we suggested that
[03:55:54.160 --> 03:56:00.000]  a photo that went viral during the Notre Dame fire had been doctored remember when the media
[03:56:00.000 --> 03:56:05.760]  claimed that I doctored the video of the White House in turn slapping down Jim Acosta's arm
[03:56:05.760 --> 03:56:10.320]  during that press conference another complete lie with them coming out claiming something's
[03:56:10.320 --> 03:56:15.440]  doctored when it wasn't doctored well now the Guardians had to apologize for something similar
[03:56:15.440 --> 03:56:21.040]  and in Instagram story on Monday which is quite convenient because that's going to disappear after
[03:56:21.040 --> 03:56:26.160]  24 hours on Instagram it's not going to be recoverable but it continues quote we have been
[03:56:26.160 --> 03:56:31.760]  contacted by the copyright owner of the photo Sputnik France and accept that it had not been
[03:56:31.760 --> 03:56:38.240]  doctored we apologize for suggesting otherwise the four months late apology refers to the
[03:56:38.240 --> 03:56:43.360]  Guardians coverage of a photo from Sputnik France's Facebook live coverage of the April 15
[03:56:43.360 --> 03:56:50.480]  Notre Dame fire so again it came back to the live Facebook coverage which is what I was watching
[03:56:50.480 --> 03:56:58.720]  when I saw Arabic names Middle Eastern accounts on Facebook voraciously vehemently celebrating the
[03:56:58.720 --> 03:57:05.200]  fire and the destruction of the Notre Dame Cathedral as it burned down so the Guardians
[03:57:05.200 --> 03:57:11.040]  had to come out and apologize Sputnik France even released the full metadata relating to the image
[03:57:11.040 --> 03:57:16.240]  and they did this months ago by the way allowing any and all fact checkers to see for themselves
[03:57:16.240 --> 03:57:20.800]  so even though that was obvious that it was a genuine authentic photo of these Middle Eastern
[03:57:20.800 --> 03:57:27.440]  men celebrating the fire the left-wing news media ran a giant hoax in the days after that fire
[03:57:27.440 --> 03:57:34.560]  claiming that it was a doctored image now they've had to apologize yet another example of fake news
[03:57:34.560 --> 03:57:38.400]  that's going to wrap it up for the show warring with Owen Stroyer it's coming up next breaking
