[00:00.000 --> 00:24.280]  Do we blame the anti-vax movement for that?
[00:24.280 --> 00:25.280]  Well yes.
[00:25.280 --> 00:29.280]  Some are calling for penalties like higher healthcare premiums, even jail time.
[00:29.280 --> 00:33.000]  These anti-vaxers, they're crazy, they're wearing tinfoil hats.
[00:33.000 --> 00:51.400]  These outbreaks are due to the anti-vax movement.
[00:51.400 --> 00:53.840]  The footage you're seeing is real.
[00:53.840 --> 00:58.040]  It's happening in Germany, it's happening in China, and it's not having Australia.
[00:58.040 --> 01:05.040]  Police with six foot sticks, patrolling the streets in Germany, making sure you stay six
[01:05.040 --> 01:07.520]  feet apart.
[01:07.520 --> 01:11.280]  It's not enough that you took all the three or four shots and are sick.
[01:11.280 --> 01:16.520]  It's not enough that you've got a vaccine tracker passport they now admit, it's logging
[01:16.520 --> 01:20.520]  all your movements to the authoritarian state.
[01:20.520 --> 01:26.160]  Now you've got to be used to government contact with the general public that aren't criminals.
[01:26.160 --> 01:31.480]  You're being trained to be a president from the moment you're born.
[01:31.480 --> 01:33.440]  Little children are being indoctrinated into this.
[01:33.440 --> 01:35.840]  This is the bio-medical takeover.
[01:35.840 --> 01:40.920]  The main way we predicted they would launch their new World Order operation.
[01:40.920 --> 01:46.680]  I've exposed this for more than 20 years because the enemy has salivated over it.
[01:46.680 --> 01:51.360]  They have given constant speeches and written white papers and books on this plan.
[01:51.360 --> 01:54.440]  That's how we know what they're going to do.
[01:54.440 --> 01:59.280]  That paradoxically, even the politicians and leaders that supposedly oppose this, like
[01:59.280 --> 02:04.960]  Senator Paul and others, eat around the edges of it and just try to dunk on Fauci.
[02:04.960 --> 02:06.960]  Oh, look, they now admit masks don't work.
[02:06.960 --> 02:07.960]  I'm dunking.
[02:07.960 --> 02:10.040]  Oh, they now admit.
[02:10.040 --> 02:12.760]  But without ever explaining that was always part of the plan.
[02:12.760 --> 02:15.400]  So the UN has now announced that we knew this was the next phase.
[02:15.400 --> 02:21.280]  We told you this 22 months ago that first they would roll out the first shot, then the
[02:21.280 --> 02:23.400]  second shot, then the booster, and then that doesn't work.
[02:23.400 --> 02:24.560]  There's another booster.
[02:24.560 --> 02:31.920]  And then they said in Australia last week and at the UN this week, okay, it's a permanent
[02:31.920 --> 02:32.920]  program.
[02:32.920 --> 02:38.040]  We've got to give you new shots all the time for the mutations of COVID-19, which they
[02:38.040 --> 02:41.200]  now test for the common cold.
[02:41.200 --> 02:45.720]  So they're outlawing you being allowed to have a common cold.
[02:45.720 --> 02:53.040]  And of course, the so-called vaccine makes your body create a toxic spike protein.
[02:53.040 --> 02:56.040]  And so they can then slowly depopulate you.
[02:56.040 --> 03:01.000]  And once they've arrested you and put you in one of their camps, they can then give
[03:01.000 --> 03:05.800]  you special batches that are mutagenic and you'll die of cancer within just three to
[03:05.800 --> 03:07.600]  six months.
[03:07.600 --> 03:08.800]  And this is how they take you away.
[03:08.800 --> 03:09.800]  It's how they kill you.
[03:09.800 --> 03:12.960]  It's how the people killing you don't really know they're even part of a depopulation
[03:12.960 --> 03:14.320]  plan.
[03:14.320 --> 03:17.560]  All they know is they go along with the first phase.
[03:17.560 --> 03:19.920]  They don't get the shot that kills them.
[03:19.920 --> 03:21.780]  They get the special lot.
[03:21.780 --> 03:23.440]  And so they go along with it.
[03:23.440 --> 03:29.480]  It's about worshiping the biomedical state, putting up the image of nurses and doctors
[03:29.480 --> 03:40.400]  that get into the fear as gods, gods saving the earth through depopulation.
[03:40.400 --> 03:46.440]  And this is all the Club of Rome, Bilderberg Group, Trilateral Commission, David Rockefeller,
[03:46.440 --> 03:53.200]  Great Reset, Agenda 21, Agenda 2030, Davos Group operation.
[03:53.200 --> 03:55.480]  And I have all the admissions, all the statements.
[03:55.480 --> 03:59.400]  So many videos, so many statements, so many admissions that, yeah, we're colonizing your
[03:59.400 --> 04:00.920]  body with nano chips.
[04:00.920 --> 04:01.920]  You can't stop us.
[04:01.920 --> 04:06.520]  They had a Pfizer, the Chief Futurist, the Davos Group, Klaus Schwab.
[04:06.520 --> 04:12.240]  I mean, they're all over the place saying this is the end of society as you know it.
[04:12.240 --> 04:16.240]  And you notice it's not a good place they're taking us to.
[04:16.240 --> 04:23.120]  Lots of censorship, total control, and now hundreds of articles today in the U.S., in
[04:23.120 --> 04:27.520]  Australia, everywhere, in the U.K., look at these headlines.
[04:27.520 --> 04:32.880]  London Telegraph, from prison threats to fines, how the world, you mean the globalist, is
[04:32.880 --> 04:37.320]  turning up the heat on the unvaccinated, you mean on the people, because you're always
[04:37.320 --> 04:38.320]  unvaccinated.
[04:38.320 --> 04:43.200]  What is an unvaccinated and vaccinated person, I'm in common, you're never fully vaccinated.
[04:43.200 --> 04:48.880]  They're announcing the camps here in the United States, it's unbelievable.
[04:48.880 --> 04:52.320]  And everyone pretending that they're part of the system going along with this are the
[04:52.320 --> 04:54.640]  biggest foodles of all.
[04:54.640 --> 05:01.600]  Your compliance is bringing hell upon us all.
[05:01.600 --> 05:06.440]  Everything we've witnessed in the last few decades has only been the build-up for what
[05:06.440 --> 05:08.440]  the globalists are doing right now.
[05:08.440 --> 05:11.600]  This is their big offensive, this is their takeover.
[05:11.600 --> 05:15.520]  This is the point that they're at their very weakest, because now they've revealed themselves.
[05:15.520 --> 05:19.560]  Now they're a world government, they're permanent martial law, their medical tyranny is out
[05:19.560 --> 05:20.560]  in the open.
[05:20.560 --> 05:25.080]  Their depopulation agenda has been exposed, but they're using their corporate power and
[05:25.080 --> 05:29.320]  trillions to go across the planet and shut down people telling the truth.
[05:29.320 --> 05:32.600]  So listen, Paul Revere's, when you spread the word about the broadcast, when you pray
[05:32.600 --> 05:37.280]  for the broadcast, you're the tip of the spear, and when you buy products at infowarstore.com,
[05:37.280 --> 05:38.280]  you keep us on air.
[05:38.280 --> 05:42.000]  Plus, we've got great products that have been sold out for months that are back in stock,
[05:42.000 --> 05:45.640]  50% off, X2 and Winter Sun.
[05:45.640 --> 05:49.240]  Both of these are on our top five best sellers, they are so good for your body, and if there's
[05:49.240 --> 05:52.400]  two things you do for your body, it's these two products.
[05:52.400 --> 05:57.040]  They're all back in stock at infowarstore.com, 50% off, and it keeps us on the air.
[05:57.040 --> 06:22.040]  The way we fail is if you don't take action.
[06:22.040 --> 06:23.800]  Well it's very simple Pete, right?
[06:23.800 --> 06:25.540]  You just have to look at Africa.
[06:25.540 --> 06:29.880]  They didn't have the death rates from COVID that were predicted, and what is happening
[06:29.880 --> 06:34.780]  over time is that the entire response to COVID and everything that we were told about it
[06:34.780 --> 06:40.800]  from the beginning is being exposed and it's falling apart, the lies are coming apart,
[06:40.800 --> 06:46.080]  and really now there's no justification for putting people out of their jobs or forcing
[06:46.080 --> 06:52.280]  vaccine mandates for a disease that ultimately is very treatable, it's cheap to treat, medicines
[06:52.280 --> 06:57.440]  are available all over the world, and it has death rates that compare very much to seasonal
[06:57.440 --> 06:58.440]  flu.
[06:58.440 --> 07:03.080]  And so in that moment, what you see on Dr. Fauci, this is what people say to me, that
[07:03.080 --> 07:09.000]  he doesn't represent science to them, he represents Joseph Mengele, Dr. Joseph Mengele, the Nazi
[07:09.000 --> 07:13.720]  doctor who did experiments on Jews during the Second World War and in the concentration
[07:13.720 --> 07:14.720]  camps.
[07:14.720 --> 07:18.960]  And I am talking about people all across the world are saying this, because the response
[07:18.960 --> 07:24.400]  from COVID, what it has done to countries everywhere, what it has done to civil liberties,
[07:24.400 --> 07:30.760]  the suicide rates, the poverty, it has obliterated economies, the level of suffering that has
[07:30.760 --> 07:37.440]  been created because of this disease is now being seen in the cold light of day, i.e.
[07:37.440 --> 07:41.880]  the truth, and people see that there is no justification for what is being done.
[07:41.880 --> 07:46.240]  So as they're being exposed and the control is slipping away, lo and behold, in other
[07:46.240 --> 07:51.560]  variants surfaces, and nobody should be surprised by that, because there will be more variants
[07:51.560 --> 07:54.440]  until the end of time.
[07:54.440 --> 07:58.640]  There will be more variants to the end of time, because this is an authoritarian world
[07:58.640 --> 08:05.000]  government depopulation takeover, where the most sacrosanct property you have, your body
[08:05.000 --> 08:08.000]  now belongs to the state.
[08:08.000 --> 08:13.720]  And all over the world, old ladies and children are being arrested for being outside without
[08:13.720 --> 08:21.600]  their COVID passports, that are now official and permanent all run by the United Nations
[08:21.600 --> 08:26.960]  and its private counterpart, the public arm of the Bilderberg group, the World Economic
[08:26.960 --> 08:30.960]  Forum or the Debo's group.
[08:30.960 --> 08:42.040]  So people ask me, Alex, what is it like to be totally vindicated and to see all the main
[08:42.040 --> 08:45.880]  leadership of the pro-human fight waking up and fighting back?
[08:45.880 --> 08:53.640]  And that's very positive, but it's also very, very sad, because folks think this is bad,
[08:53.640 --> 09:00.960]  I know what the next phases are, and we won't be on air, and most of us will be dead.
[09:00.960 --> 09:04.920]  And so I just want everybody that works for the system to remember that, I'm not the one
[09:04.920 --> 09:08.440]  that's going to kill you, I'm not the one that's going to have a revolution with you,
[09:08.440 --> 09:12.680]  I'm not the one, no, no, you've killed yourself going along with this.
[09:12.680 --> 09:18.640]  By increments following orders and doing this, this is a design-controlled collapse of civilization.
[09:18.640 --> 09:21.760]  I want to explain something to everybody.
[09:21.760 --> 09:27.200]  A lot of people from my Saturday show and my Sunday show, I saw in the comments, not
[09:27.200 --> 09:32.360]  the majority, but a hefty minority were like, oh, Jones is calling for peace, Jones is calling
[09:32.360 --> 09:36.880]  for not being violent, Jones is calling for not overthrowing the government because he's
[09:36.880 --> 09:42.840]  scared and because he's selling out, and no, that's not why I'm doing this.
[09:42.840 --> 09:47.200]  It's because the globalists want conflict, they want a civil war, because they're losing
[09:47.200 --> 09:52.720]  intellectually, that's why they've launched the medical biomedical tyranny system as their
[09:52.720 --> 09:59.520]  only smoke screen, their only hope of stopping us from taking the planet back.
[09:59.520 --> 10:05.680]  And so strategically the worst thing to do, plus, do you think that the Justice Department
[10:05.680 --> 10:11.120]  and the FBI actually run the country, do you think Congress really does, do you think President
[10:11.120 --> 10:18.640]  Biden does, do you think the governors do, and the answer's no.
[10:18.640 --> 10:28.360]  You know, I don't like Xi Jinping, but early last year he gave a speech in a hotel to the
[10:28.360 --> 10:34.040]  security agencies and heads of the Communist Party in China, several thousand people, and
[10:34.040 --> 10:37.280]  he said in that meeting, there's even been New York Times and Wall Street Journal articles
[10:37.280 --> 10:41.160]  about it, and actually went and found the Chinese People's Daily, and then the full
[10:41.160 --> 10:50.480]  text was in another one of the party's groups, but it translates to the truth, the party's
[10:50.480 --> 10:57.840]  truth, and I read his whole speech in English, it was a long speech, and he said, the number
[10:57.840 --> 11:06.200]  one threat to our Communist program is the megacorporations, and he goes ahead and says,
[11:06.200 --> 11:10.640]  yeah, sure, they helped get us into power, and they've been using us and our people,
[11:10.640 --> 11:14.600]  but they're the enemy, and they want to depopulate, and they want to enslave, and they want to
[11:14.600 --> 11:18.880]  deindustrialize, and when they're done taking down the West using our labor and our people,
[11:18.880 --> 11:24.080]  they're going to take us down, we need to decouple from them, and he said, I'm announcing
[11:24.080 --> 11:29.640]  incentives to have three children, we're no longer going to kill the second born, and
[11:29.640 --> 11:33.400]  in fact, we're going to incentivize more than three children.
[11:33.400 --> 11:36.840]  We're not going with the globalist depopulation plan.
[11:36.840 --> 11:42.320]  Incredible speech, same thing with Bolsonaro, and he's not a communist, he's the opposite,
[11:42.320 --> 11:48.080]  but I don't care if you're a communist or a populist like Bolsonaro, you need to choose
[11:48.080 --> 11:56.360]  life and a pro-human future, because if you choose the New World Order depopulation plan,
[11:56.360 --> 12:01.160]  you choose tens of billions dead, because not just those living, but into the future,
[12:01.160 --> 12:06.680]  they'll be culling numbers, and it will cause wars, and it will cause total destabilization,
[12:06.680 --> 12:12.800]  it will cause complete collapse, and there's no way the Rockefeller-Karnegie endowment
[12:12.800 --> 12:18.080]  plan carried out by the Bilderberg group, the Davos group, is going to work, because
[12:18.080 --> 12:20.000]  human nature just doesn't operate like that.
[12:20.000 --> 12:24.720]  They think with smartphones and AI grid and social credit scores, they'll be able to enforce
[12:24.720 --> 12:29.800]  it, but it's not going to do that, and it's designed to collapse society, but I'm saying
[12:29.800 --> 12:34.960]  it's going to create and is creating an uncontrolled collapse.
[12:34.960 --> 12:40.200]  Yes, China is banning men not seen as masculine from television.
[12:40.200 --> 12:44.680]  They put homosexuals in work camps, I'm not saying that's a good thing.
[12:44.680 --> 12:47.800]  They are promoting having three or more children now.
[12:47.800 --> 12:52.920]  They've broken with the New World Order, and so what did Soros come out and say?
[12:52.920 --> 12:56.040]  Soros said Xi Jinping is the new Hitler.
[12:56.040 --> 13:01.040]  Well, he certainly killed a lot of people, and as I would say, in the same category,
[13:01.040 --> 13:08.480]  but he's a Hitler doesn't like you, plus you actually work for Hitler, buddy boy.
[13:08.480 --> 13:10.800]  So see, that's the big seismic shift.
[13:10.800 --> 13:12.080]  That's the levels I'm thinking about.
[13:12.080 --> 13:16.080]  I'm thinking about Africa, I'm thinking about Eurasia, I'm thinking about South America,
[13:16.080 --> 13:19.400]  Central America, North America, I'm thinking about the real global players and what they're
[13:19.400 --> 13:25.600]  actually doing, and then all this mindlessness with the militias always being trained by
[13:25.600 --> 13:29.920]  the FBI provocateurs in their midst and the Defense Department provocateurs in their midst
[13:29.920 --> 13:34.120]  and the Southern Poverty Law Center and ADL provocateurs in their midst that, oh, attack
[13:34.120 --> 13:40.040]  a federal building, oh, go shoot up a synagogue, that'll stop the establishment, oh, yeah.
[13:40.040 --> 13:45.240]  We're dealing with human cloning, human animal splicing, publicly going on everywhere.
[13:45.240 --> 13:51.520]  We're dealing with a world off the rails.
[13:51.520 --> 13:57.880]  I've always talked about the big picture and the million-foot view, but understand that
[13:57.880 --> 14:03.720]  the globalist held Russia captured for 80-something years and had a depopulation plan there, and
[14:03.720 --> 14:05.440]  the Russians have finally struggled out of it.
[14:05.440 --> 14:06.440]  It doesn't mean they're perfect.
[14:06.440 --> 14:10.800]  They've got their own problems, their own authoritarianism, but that's what you fall
[14:10.800 --> 14:13.360]  back into when you're under that type of outside attack.
[14:13.360 --> 14:15.480]  That's a normal function of survival.
[14:15.480 --> 14:16.760]  I'm not defending it.
[14:16.760 --> 14:22.840]  The Chinese have been a project of the New World Order since their own revolution in
[14:22.840 --> 14:27.320]  the 40s that was aided by the CIA.
[14:27.320 --> 14:30.560]  And so the fact that Russia says, we'll pay you to have more children and we don't want
[14:30.560 --> 14:36.000]  sissy men on TV, and China has adopted that shows, they've chosen life.
[14:36.000 --> 14:40.840]  And I can tell you, at the highest levels of the Communist Party in China, they listen
[14:40.840 --> 14:41.840]  to this show.
[14:41.840 --> 14:44.200]  And at the highest levels of the Russian government, they listen to my show.
[14:44.200 --> 14:48.080]  At the highest levels of the Brazilian government, they listen to this show.
[14:48.080 --> 14:51.920]  And Tucker Carlson listens, and Joe Rogan listens, and anybody that's smart listens.
[14:51.920 --> 14:53.440]  And that's not me up here bragging.
[14:53.440 --> 14:57.800]  I'm telling you, it's because I have the best handle on what's going on for actually
[14:57.800 --> 15:02.760]  researching the academic level papers and then integrating it into a world unified field
[15:02.760 --> 15:04.960]  theory.
[15:04.960 --> 15:13.400]  And if people don't decide to choose life and to choose peace, we're all dead.
[15:13.400 --> 15:17.240]  And so I'm just, you know, never going to commit suicide and love life, but I'm just
[15:17.240 --> 15:23.400]  making preparations and really feeling guilty every day that I'm even here instead of in
[15:23.400 --> 15:28.600]  an extremely rural area around just a few people I can trust and just praying every
[15:28.600 --> 15:32.960]  day and trying to grow crops and getting close to God, because you're going to see a massive
[15:32.960 --> 15:35.400]  exodus in the coming future of the countryside.
[15:35.400 --> 15:37.960]  And then the cities are going to collapse, everybody's going to run.
[15:37.960 --> 15:41.040]  And it's going to be war, total war, folks.
[15:41.040 --> 15:43.360]  So everybody better just get ready.
[15:43.360 --> 15:45.080]  I am not anybody's enemy.
[15:45.080 --> 15:46.080]  I don't want this to happen.
[15:46.080 --> 15:47.080]  I told you it was coming.
[15:47.080 --> 15:48.240]  It's here.
[15:48.240 --> 15:50.480]  And the globalists are just pawns of Satan.
[15:50.480 --> 15:54.120]  The only enemy I have is Satan and I can't defeat Satan, but Jesus Christ, who's in me
[15:54.120 --> 15:55.120]  can.
[15:55.120 --> 15:56.120]  We'll be right back.
[15:56.120 --> 16:00.120]  Stay with us.
[16:00.120 --> 16:06.000]  Christmas 2021 is over, but you still got a really great chance to give yourself the
[16:06.000 --> 16:10.640]  gift of free speech and liberty and freedom into the new year, all at the same time making
[16:10.640 --> 16:15.400]  yourself healthier, wealthier and wiser by boosting your immune system.
[16:15.400 --> 16:20.440]  Two of our top selling products that have been sold out for a long time are now back
[16:20.440 --> 16:21.440]  in stock.
[16:21.440 --> 16:26.280]  Winter Sun, the highest quality vitamin D3, taken under the tongue for higher absorption
[16:26.280 --> 16:27.960]  is back in stock.
[16:27.960 --> 16:31.400]  Despite the effects that have been sold out for months, it is 50% off.
[16:31.400 --> 16:36.880]  And then our number one best seller of all time, Survival Shield X2 Deeper Crystal iodine,
[16:36.880 --> 16:41.120]  the game changer, the missing link, not just for immune system, but all electrochemical
[16:41.120 --> 16:44.640]  activity in the body, it's back in stock 50% off.
[16:44.640 --> 16:50.000]  So that's the new year special, and that's Christmas comes early in 2022, ladies and gentlemen.
[16:50.000 --> 16:55.480]  Give yourself the gift of health and clarity and focus with X2 and Winter Sun at infowarstore.com,
[16:55.480 --> 16:58.800]  50% off for a limited time.
[16:58.800 --> 16:59.880]  Thanks for keeping us on the air.
[16:59.880 --> 17:06.640]  In late August, Info War saw an explosion of orders because our audience understands
[17:06.640 --> 17:13.000]  that the globalist are destabilizing the planet by design and are attempting to cause an economic
[17:13.000 --> 17:16.120]  and financial collapse worldwide.
[17:16.120 --> 17:19.440]  Now ladies and gentlemen, storeable food has always been something that's important to
[17:19.440 --> 17:20.440]  have.
[17:20.440 --> 17:24.840]  It's a check box that everybody needs to have, taking care of, right along with water filtration,
[17:24.840 --> 17:27.160]  self-defense and a relationship with God.
[17:27.160 --> 17:30.600]  But now more than ever, you need to get your storeable food orders in.
[17:30.600 --> 17:33.960]  Now, we're ready to ship to you within 24 hours of your order.
[17:33.960 --> 17:34.960]  It's high quality.
[17:34.960 --> 17:39.680]  It's very, very low cost at infowarstore.com because in the future, you're going to see
[17:39.680 --> 17:44.000]  more food supply shortages and you're going to see food supply price increases that are
[17:44.000 --> 17:45.320]  already taking place.
[17:45.320 --> 17:51.600]  So lock in your storeable food now at a lower price and fund the Info War at infowarstore.com.
[17:51.600 --> 17:55.680]  That's how you fight the great reset is by being self-sufficient and not under their
[17:55.680 --> 17:56.680]  control.
[17:56.680 --> 17:59.680]  So get prepared now at infowarstore.com.
[17:59.680 --> 18:02.520]  UN-run contact tracers aren't coming.
[18:02.520 --> 18:07.680]  They're here all over the world from Australia to the United States from Canada to Germany.
[18:07.680 --> 18:11.160]  These tyrants are tracking everything you do everywhere you go and then coming to your
[18:11.160 --> 18:16.880]  house and threatening in some cases actually taking people away into the night to their
[18:16.880 --> 18:17.880]  facilities.
[18:17.880 --> 18:22.680]  And they're planning in the next year to expand their shield process where they come and take
[18:22.680 --> 18:26.640]  quote healthy people away and put them in facilities for their safety.
[18:26.640 --> 18:28.440]  This is nothing less than martial law.
[18:28.440 --> 18:32.680]  And one big thing you can do to fight back is to get high quality Faraday cages, many
[18:32.680 --> 18:36.960]  of which are made here in America and are very compliant, meaning U.S. government military
[18:36.960 --> 18:39.600]  grade at infowarstore.com.
[18:39.600 --> 18:44.600]  We have the entire line of silent pocket ready to ship to you when you visit infowarstore.com.
[18:44.600 --> 18:49.960]  Again, we have big backpacks, we have special dry bags, we've got them for cell phones,
[18:49.960 --> 18:52.560]  we've got them for laptops, we've got them for iPads.
[18:52.560 --> 18:55.120]  It's all there at infowarstore.com.
[18:55.120 --> 18:59.680]  So protect your privacy today and support the Info War at infowarstore.com.
[18:59.680 --> 19:05.480]  We've all heard about the pastor and his famous statement from inside a concentration camp
[19:05.480 --> 19:09.840]  in World War II that when they came for one group, he wasn't part of that group so he
[19:09.840 --> 19:10.840]  didn't stand up.
[19:10.840 --> 19:13.480]  And then when they came for another group, he wasn't part of that group so he didn't
[19:13.480 --> 19:14.480]  stand up.
[19:14.480 --> 19:18.480]  And finally, when they came for him, there was nobody else to stand up.
[19:18.480 --> 19:21.800]  Well, the Global Social Credit Score that China is putting in that's banning people
[19:21.800 --> 19:25.520]  to three hours of video games a week and if you criticize the government, you can never
[19:25.520 --> 19:27.480]  buy or sell again.
[19:27.480 --> 19:31.920]  Well that's being brought here and all over the world under the guise of COVID vaccine
[19:31.920 --> 19:32.920]  passports.
[19:32.920 --> 19:33.920]  They even admit it.
[19:33.920 --> 19:36.160]  There's going to be a carbon tax attached to it.
[19:36.160 --> 19:39.600]  They're going to track where you go and what you do and decide where you can go and what
[19:39.600 --> 19:40.600]  you can do.
[19:40.600 --> 19:42.400]  That's what the lockdowns are about.
[19:42.400 --> 19:43.400]  You'll accept that.
[19:43.400 --> 19:44.400]  You'll accept anything.
[19:44.400 --> 19:49.160]  So again, the left is having fun right now with all the censorship and tyranny pretending
[19:49.160 --> 19:52.120]  like they're part of the power structure but they're all going to be targeted by this
[19:52.120 --> 19:53.120]  nightmare as well.
[19:53.120 --> 19:57.240]  We need to get back to basic human rights and promote them or all of us will be enslaved
[19:57.240 --> 20:01.400]  by this horrible technocracy run by the globalists.
[20:01.400 --> 20:12.760]  Speaking of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:12.760 --> 20:23.760]  The globalists didn't just create fentanyl and MIT that have the Communist Chinese producing
[20:23.760 --> 20:26.160]  shipping over the country to kill millions.
[20:26.160 --> 20:31.400]  They didn't just work overtime through Wall Street to deindustrialize and sell off all
[20:31.400 --> 20:34.440]  the major industry in the Midwest and other areas of the country.
[20:34.440 --> 20:39.800]  They didn't just promote and push systems to collapse the family.
[20:39.800 --> 20:43.920]  They're now coming at us with the poisons and injections that a racer immune system
[20:43.920 --> 20:52.040]  give you cancer and major heart problems because they're killing you because it's a war because
[20:52.040 --> 20:56.360]  they've taken over through the financial system and don't need us anymore and are bringing
[20:56.360 --> 21:00.640]  computers and robots online to serve them.
[21:00.640 --> 21:04.440]  The outer members of this globalist death cult believe they're going to kill 90% of
[21:04.440 --> 21:06.440]  the public.
[21:06.440 --> 21:11.320]  Now members of the cult, and I've met and talked to some of the top people, understand
[21:11.320 --> 21:14.720]  they are slated for destruction as well.
[21:14.720 --> 21:18.280]  You understand I have met with top scientists, top.
[21:18.280 --> 21:19.880]  I have met with top people in Hollywood.
[21:19.880 --> 21:21.360]  I've met with top people in the government.
[21:21.360 --> 21:25.880]  I've met with top people that are been part of this but don't want to be part of it and
[21:25.880 --> 21:28.400]  don't know what to do.
[21:28.400 --> 21:33.000]  And I've told them I don't know what they can do because if you've been part of this
[21:33.000 --> 21:37.720]  group and you speak out, they have a directive to kill them.
[21:37.720 --> 21:41.480]  These people are risking their lives even to talk to me.
[21:41.480 --> 21:43.680]  So there's not much time left, okay?
[21:43.680 --> 21:46.440]  It's in the game.
[21:46.440 --> 21:48.960]  It's in the game.
[21:48.960 --> 21:52.840]  Everybody needs to get extremely focused and crystal clear on what you're dealing with
[21:52.840 --> 21:54.160]  and that's the only way out of this.
[21:54.160 --> 21:57.120]  And the globalists are going to make their run at depopulating everybody.
[21:57.120 --> 21:58.120]  They're going to make their run.
[21:58.120 --> 22:00.160]  The Bible says they'll fail.
[22:00.160 --> 22:02.600]  But a fourth of the earth's humans will be killed.
[22:02.600 --> 22:07.840]  That sounds like a low estimate but I'm sure it's true.
[22:07.840 --> 22:11.040]  And people ask them, I'm trying to scare you, no.
[22:11.040 --> 22:15.840]  You hear these stories where wildfires, there's 50 mile an hour winds and wildfires are traveling
[22:15.840 --> 22:20.280]  a couple miles an hour.
[22:20.280 --> 22:22.880]  And you get the emergency call, get out of your house now.
[22:22.880 --> 22:24.720]  The fires are 10 minutes away.
[22:24.720 --> 22:28.000]  If you don't get out in 10 minutes, you barbecue in your house and die.
[22:28.000 --> 22:30.480]  And you're like, well, how do we get out of this?
[22:30.480 --> 22:35.280]  We have a giant awakening to the program and how horrible it is and what it is and what
[22:35.280 --> 22:36.280]  the enemy is.
[22:36.280 --> 22:41.720]  The UN, the Debo's Group, the Carnegie Endowment, the Rockefeller Foundation that runs the CIA
[22:41.720 --> 22:42.720]  publicly.
[22:42.720 --> 22:43.720]  They're in full command.
[22:43.720 --> 22:48.880]  And if you look at their ministers and their top people, they look completely scared.
[22:48.880 --> 22:52.400]  When you see the CIA director, the former head of the Carnegie Endowment, he looks like
[22:52.400 --> 22:56.520]  he is in front of a firing squad because he's being ordered to do this.
[22:56.520 --> 23:00.200]  Do you think they like the moment we're actually at?
[23:00.200 --> 23:03.200]  General Stubblebine told me when he was in meetings with these people in the 80s, he
[23:03.200 --> 23:04.760]  was the head of the Army.
[23:04.760 --> 23:09.800]  And the Army was trying to talk him out of this stuff, that the people there were government
[23:09.800 --> 23:14.200]  leaders, presidents, prime ministers, and they were scared.
[23:14.200 --> 23:16.520]  His wife, on record, treated heads of state.
[23:16.520 --> 23:20.120]  They told her the same thing in the 2000s.
[23:20.120 --> 23:24.840]  That's how she told Jesse Ventura on his show what was coming and how they'd use lockdowns
[23:24.840 --> 23:25.840]  and the shots.
[23:25.840 --> 23:31.000]  And I was like, this is a damn plan, people, you understand this?
[23:31.000 --> 23:37.480]  And even heads of state, even queens, were like, I just don't feel good about it.
[23:37.480 --> 23:38.800]  It's terrible to get rid of everyone.
[23:38.800 --> 23:42.640]  It's going to be such a calamity, but if we don't, the carrying capacity we reach will
[23:42.640 --> 23:43.640]  be a giant war.
[23:43.640 --> 23:47.400]  So if we don't trigger this now, it won't be controlled, but I just feel terrible about
[23:47.400 --> 23:48.400]  it.
[23:48.400 --> 23:49.400]  Don't you?
[23:49.400 --> 23:50.400]  The Great Culling?
[23:50.400 --> 23:55.600]  And they write books talking about it now and saying, but the people that say they love
[23:55.600 --> 23:59.320]  it and enjoy it in Wall Street Journal, it's going to be, there's going to be no humans
[23:59.320 --> 24:00.320]  soon.
[24:00.320 --> 24:01.320]  It's so great.
[24:01.320 --> 24:02.320]  We're obsolete.
[24:02.320 --> 24:03.320]  Viruses are going to kill us.
[24:03.320 --> 24:04.720]  Yeah, viruses you made.
[24:04.720 --> 24:10.840]  They tell you, it's your fault, global warming caused super viruses to come and now you're
[24:10.840 --> 24:11.840]  going to die.
[24:11.840 --> 24:19.240]  No, you made them in a lab and COVID-19 is just the first salvo.
[24:19.240 --> 24:28.400]  So even heads of state are not running things and they are scared and they should be scared
[24:28.400 --> 24:37.720]  to go to a school that my son was going to when he was five for a couple of years.
[24:37.720 --> 24:41.280]  I got to know some top scientists that were very well off and done very well and then
[24:41.280 --> 24:46.360]  run out to the Texas Hill Country from Maryland where they'd lived doing work in these groups
[24:46.360 --> 24:50.040]  and they, they, they were just completely freaked out and scared because that was in
[24:50.040 --> 24:55.280]  the late like 2000 and it was like 2010.
[24:55.280 --> 24:59.520]  That's right when Rima Labo was saying the plan because they, they did a test then in
[24:59.520 --> 25:04.240]  2009, 2010 and said, we're launching operations in 2011.
[25:04.240 --> 25:08.600]  What you saw launched in 2000, they said, all right, prepare everyone and they went
[25:08.600 --> 25:10.120]  and had their meetings and got their orders.
[25:10.120 --> 25:14.160]  You know, you put your cell phones up, you go in to a Faraday cage and you get your directive
[25:14.160 --> 25:17.880]  and it's a global directive group that don't have a name for it and they go in and they're
[25:17.880 --> 25:22.200]  telling them, all right, we're launching operations in six months, get your family,
[25:22.200 --> 25:25.960]  get yourself ready and be ready to report to these stations.
[25:25.960 --> 25:29.960]  We'll have a cure for you, but not for others and we're going to go ahead and launch Airborne
[25:29.960 --> 25:30.960]  Ebola.
[25:30.960 --> 25:38.000]  Remember right around that same time, Dr, the head of the biology department at UT, Pionka
[25:38.000 --> 25:41.400]  said on the news, he said, soon I'll be dead, my whole family, but we love it.
[25:41.400 --> 25:42.400]  It's for the earth.
[25:42.400 --> 25:44.560]  Airborne Ebola will be released imminently.
[25:44.560 --> 25:45.560]  That was 2007.
[25:45.560 --> 25:52.160]  He said within three years because he was in a deeper cell of it on his own UT website.
[25:52.160 --> 25:57.720]  He says, I love Lucifer, he's dressed in druid robes and he wants you to die completely
[25:57.720 --> 25:58.720]  out of his mind.
[25:58.720 --> 26:03.920]  But that's, oh, he's the head of the UT biology department and the head of the UT botany department
[26:03.920 --> 26:09.200]  basically told my dad the same thing in the 1960s, tried to recruit him.
[26:09.200 --> 26:15.400]  So this is a death cult and they told him that they were going to launch it in 2009,
[26:15.400 --> 26:16.400]  2010.
[26:16.400 --> 26:19.960]  Labo and Stubblebine ran to Costa Rica because they were told by their sources it was imminent,
[26:19.960 --> 26:25.960]  but that was a drill to test and see if their people were going to go along with it.
[26:25.960 --> 26:29.520]  Labo and Stubblebine had since gotten out of it, but they were told by their sources
[26:29.520 --> 26:33.520]  and by heads of state.
[26:33.520 --> 26:36.640]  So these are the real discussions they have.
[26:36.640 --> 26:42.360]  I mean, you know the Pentagon has on those record plans.
[26:42.360 --> 26:46.200]  If there is a war and things collapse and there's 100,000 survivors, say, coming from
[26:46.200 --> 26:53.280]  Chicago after it gets nuked a year after towards Cheyenne Mountain to dig out the alternate
[26:53.280 --> 26:58.160]  government that they've got weapons and things to kill those people before they, quote, take
[26:58.160 --> 27:02.000]  out the seat of government, they're not going to help people on the surface when this all
[27:02.000 --> 27:07.600]  goes down.
[27:07.600 --> 27:10.680]  So I'm just telling you, prepare to die.
[27:10.680 --> 27:14.200]  And I don't want you to commit suicide.
[27:14.200 --> 27:17.600]  You need to spend your energy and time warning people and getting them ready.
[27:17.600 --> 27:18.720]  And that's the only hope.
[27:18.720 --> 27:20.200]  That's why it's not going to be 90%.
[27:20.200 --> 27:29.520]  You believe the Bible, they're only going to kill a quarter during that period of mass
[27:29.520 --> 27:30.520]  killing.
[27:30.520 --> 27:31.520]  There's a buildup to it.
[27:31.520 --> 27:33.640]  So, I mean, I'm telling you what's going on.
[27:33.640 --> 27:37.240]  I mean, I didn't just get up here on air and say, oh, this is to say it to scary and put
[27:37.240 --> 27:40.480]  myself in the crosshairs of the government.
[27:40.480 --> 27:43.520]  But this is out of my hands now.
[27:43.520 --> 27:45.920]  I tried to stop being launched.
[27:45.920 --> 27:46.920]  We're out of beta.
[27:46.920 --> 27:47.920]  They pulled the trigger.
[27:47.920 --> 27:48.920]  We're in it.
[27:48.920 --> 27:49.920]  The collapse has begun.
[27:49.920 --> 27:54.400]  And I love you and I care about you all and I'm so sorry.
[27:54.400 --> 27:55.400]  I could have worked harder.
[27:55.400 --> 27:56.400]  I could have done a better job.
[27:56.400 --> 27:57.400]  I'm serious.
[27:57.400 --> 27:58.400]  I have failed you.
[27:58.400 --> 28:00.400]  I'm so sorry.
[28:00.400 --> 28:02.400]  I'm serious.
[28:02.400 --> 28:05.840]  So, oh my God.
[28:05.840 --> 28:12.240]  I mean, this is so horrible and all the liberals that left us that don't give a damn about anything.
[28:12.240 --> 28:17.820]  They're laughing and the owners of a major basketball team just says, I don't care if
[28:17.820 --> 28:19.320]  China has death camps.
[28:19.320 --> 28:24.360]  I start laughing.
[28:24.360 --> 28:26.680]  I mean, it's the soullessness.
[28:26.680 --> 28:31.040]  Does this idiot think he's going to be safe when all this is going on if he doesn't care
[28:31.040 --> 28:36.080]  about tens of millions of people, three million of them that have already been basically murdered?
[28:36.080 --> 28:42.400]  He thinks it's funny because he's a selfish monster.
[28:42.400 --> 28:45.240]  It's the name of the game.
[28:45.240 --> 28:49.680]  We'll play that when we come back and then I've got the war with Russia that they say
[28:49.680 --> 28:53.280]  is going to start any time from tomorrow to the middle of next month.
[28:53.280 --> 29:00.960]  The Pentagon believes the war officially starts in the next month.
[29:00.960 --> 29:05.840]  Everything we've witnessed in the last few decades has only been the buildup for what
[29:05.840 --> 29:07.800]  the globalists are doing right now.
[29:07.800 --> 29:09.520]  This is their big offensive.
[29:09.520 --> 29:10.920]  This is their takeover.
[29:10.920 --> 29:14.920]  And this is the point that they're at their very weakest because now they've revealed themselves.
[29:14.920 --> 29:18.960]  Now they're a world government, they're permanent martial law, their medical tyranny is out
[29:18.960 --> 29:19.960]  in the open.
[29:19.960 --> 29:24.440]  Their depopulation agenda has been exposed, but they're using their corporate power and
[29:24.440 --> 29:28.720]  trillions to go across the planet and shut down people telling the truth.
[29:28.720 --> 29:32.000]  So listen, Paul Revere's, when you spread the word about the broadcast, when you pray
[29:32.000 --> 29:36.680]  for the broadcast, you're the tip of the spear and when you buy products at infowarstore.com,
[29:36.680 --> 29:37.680]  you keep us on air.
[29:37.680 --> 29:41.480]  Plus, we've got great products that have been sold out for months that are back in stock,
[29:41.480 --> 29:45.000]  50% off, X2 and Winter Sun.
[29:45.000 --> 29:48.600]  Both of these are on our top five best sellers that are so good for your body and if there's
[29:48.600 --> 29:51.760]  two things you do for your body, it's these two products.
[29:51.760 --> 29:56.400]  They're all back in stock at infowarstore.com, 50% off and it keeps us on the air.
[29:56.400 --> 29:59.400]  The only way we fail is if you don't take action.
[29:59.400 --> 30:04.760]  Get our great bag of it here.
[30:04.760 --> 30:09.480]  I mean this is from, people say, why is it from Chiapas, Mexico, the communists?
[30:09.480 --> 30:14.200]  Well that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested above organic
[30:14.200 --> 30:17.960]  in the volcanic soil, better than Guatemalan coffee and yeah, we buy it from the little
[30:17.960 --> 30:21.880]  farmers that, you know, the media calls communists, but really they're just a commune and whatever
[30:21.880 --> 30:25.480]  the point is, is that it's good coffee and we've got it and the farmers don't let the
[30:25.480 --> 30:26.480]  Mexican government take over.
[30:26.480 --> 30:29.920]  So I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels and I've been buying it for what, 14 years
[30:29.920 --> 30:31.120]  and the price has never gone up.
[30:31.120 --> 30:35.200]  The same stuff's sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more per pound
[30:35.200 --> 30:38.000]  and I just think it's some of the best coffee you're going to find anywhere.
[30:38.000 --> 30:42.240]  It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend from the Chiapas Rebels, literally, in fact, I'm
[30:42.240 --> 30:45.240]  not going to tell you a little story.
[30:45.240 --> 30:49.560]  We had like that, okay, you wouldn't believe it.
[30:49.560 --> 30:54.520]  Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com and that's how we fund this operation and if you don't
[30:54.520 --> 30:56.960]  find us and don't want to share, that's fine.
[30:56.960 --> 31:02.160]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[31:02.160 --> 31:04.040]  Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee.
[31:04.040 --> 31:05.040]  Welcome.
[31:05.040 --> 31:06.040]  Hello, Alex.
[31:06.040 --> 31:07.040]  Yes, Malcolm.
[31:07.040 --> 31:08.040]  All right.
[31:08.040 --> 31:10.040]  I will make this quick and real short where the other Patriots can get on the line.
[31:10.040 --> 31:14.800]  Uh, Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Shroyer, Super
[31:14.800 --> 31:17.520]  Male Vitality and Brain Force Plus.
[31:17.520 --> 31:18.520]  Mix those two together.
[31:18.520 --> 31:20.520]  You're an unstoppable tank.
[31:20.520 --> 31:22.360]  Super Male Vitality really, really works.
[31:22.360 --> 31:28.520]  It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up and so it has
[31:28.520 --> 31:33.440]  a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions that also work quite well that just aren't
[31:33.440 --> 31:34.440]  as strong.
[31:34.440 --> 31:35.880]  This is like a very fine wine.
[31:35.880 --> 31:38.280]  It's, in fact, each batch is different.
[31:38.280 --> 31:39.280]  Sometimes it's super strong.
[31:39.280 --> 31:40.280]  Sometimes it's just okay.
[31:40.280 --> 31:43.760]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't strong?
[31:43.760 --> 31:44.760]  That's just how it is.
[31:44.760 --> 31:45.760]  It's how it works.
[31:45.760 --> 31:47.920]  Uh, so it's always good.
[31:47.920 --> 31:49.800]  It's just sometimes it's like super strong.
[31:49.800 --> 31:56.800]  But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[31:56.800 --> 32:04.160]  This is a great sponsor.
[32:04.160 --> 32:07.760]  We have one of the best deals you're going to find out there on a high quality, high
[32:07.760 --> 32:09.640]  rated satellite phone.
[32:09.640 --> 32:10.640]  You can't be tracked.
[32:10.640 --> 32:11.640]  You can't be traced.
[32:11.640 --> 32:14.320]  It'll work anywhere in the world where you can see the sky.
[32:14.320 --> 32:18.040]  You can also buy cheap antennas and things for your car in your house that also are on
[32:18.040 --> 32:20.040]  the site infowarsphone.com.
[32:20.040 --> 32:22.000]  That's just a site that takes you to these folks.
[32:22.000 --> 32:25.920]  They supply the board for all everybody, but their systems as well are amazing folks and
[32:25.920 --> 32:33.240]  you get a free phone, a $600 to $50 value, absolutely free at infowarsphone.com.
[32:33.240 --> 32:35.320]  Smartphones are always tracking everything you do.
[32:35.320 --> 32:36.320]  These aren't.
[32:36.320 --> 32:37.720]  And the calls are free when folks call you.
[32:37.720 --> 32:42.520]  You just pay $99.95 a month for your minutes, $150 minutes.
[32:42.520 --> 32:45.920]  So the calls you were free works like a regular cell phone, you're not being tracked or traced.
[32:45.920 --> 32:49.640]  And I keep one of my car, I've given them to my parents as gifts way out the middle
[32:49.640 --> 32:56.920]  of nowhere where regular phones don't work, they work, infowarsphone.com or 941-955-1029-4195-1020
[32:56.920 --> 33:01.400]  and ask the Alex Jones special.
[33:01.400 --> 33:14.040]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:14.040 --> 33:21.600]  You found it, the tip of the spear, it is the Alex Jones show.
[33:21.600 --> 33:28.640]  So Laura Logan has been dropped by her talent agency for pointing out that Anthony Fauci
[33:28.640 --> 33:30.160]  is basically the angel of death.
[33:30.160 --> 33:34.760]  That's exactly what they're doing with these deadly shots.
[33:34.760 --> 33:39.680]  And she says that they may take her off Fox for telling the truth.
[33:39.680 --> 33:43.240]  So here she is talking about the reality of what's happened.
[33:43.240 --> 33:46.840]  I don't want to play the clip again first.
[33:46.840 --> 33:52.360]  And then I want to play for you another one of these billionaires making his money off
[33:52.360 --> 33:57.920]  the slavery in China and off the NBA being a big popular thing in China saying China
[33:57.920 --> 34:05.480]  does nothing wrong and that's just like USA Today saying pedophilia is good and we should
[34:05.480 --> 34:06.800]  abolish the family.
[34:06.800 --> 34:10.000]  You say why are they saying all this because it's their coming out.
[34:10.000 --> 34:11.280]  They've been exposed.
[34:11.280 --> 34:12.760]  We were close to kicking them out.
[34:12.760 --> 34:16.000]  We almost defeated globalism five, six years ago around the world.
[34:16.000 --> 34:17.000]  It was in trouble.
[34:17.000 --> 34:22.440]  And so now they're just saying, yeah, we are authoritarians.
[34:22.440 --> 34:24.160]  Yeah, we don't care.
[34:24.160 --> 34:28.200]  Yeah, we got private security, but you're not going to have police and you're not going
[34:28.200 --> 34:31.400]  to have your own guns die.
[34:31.400 --> 34:35.400]  But while you're at it, watch the NBA while this class happens.
[34:35.400 --> 34:42.240]  Tech CEO, NBA co-owner, nobody cares about what's happening to the Uyghurs in China.
[34:42.240 --> 34:46.720]  Up to five million of them in camps, millions killed over the years, mass executions just
[34:46.720 --> 34:51.120]  because they're Muslims and they're not radical Muslims that are attacking the government.
[34:51.120 --> 34:56.520]  But because China wants that area for living space, labors through.
[34:56.520 --> 35:01.720]  So here's Laura Logan, famous reporter, husband, high level CIA.
[35:01.720 --> 35:03.160]  She's trying to join humanity.
[35:03.160 --> 35:04.240]  I didn't even know she was at the event.
[35:04.240 --> 35:08.320]  I was at a few months ago in San Antonio, missed her just by minutes, but she's obviously
[35:08.320 --> 35:13.720]  red pilled and she knows we're in trouble.
[35:13.720 --> 35:17.760]  And she doesn't want things to go to black pill where there's no hope, but we're going
[35:17.760 --> 35:21.600]  from red pill to black pill, but that's okay because we're going to have to finally call
[35:21.600 --> 35:24.840]  out to God to save us and to intervene and God will show us.
[35:24.840 --> 35:26.960]  That's how it works.
[35:26.960 --> 35:30.760]  So get your soul pointed at God at Jesus Christ and do it fast.
[35:30.760 --> 35:32.960]  And I'm telling myself that every millisecond.
[35:32.960 --> 35:39.240]  So here's Laura Logan, what they don't want you to hear said over a month ago, gonna get
[35:39.240 --> 35:43.360]  her taken off television, but that's okay because she's now on the right side of history.
[35:43.360 --> 35:44.360]  Here it is.
[35:44.360 --> 35:46.720]  Well, it's very simple, Pete, right?
[35:46.720 --> 35:48.480]  You just have to look at Africa.
[35:48.480 --> 35:52.080]  They didn't have the death rates from COVID that were predicted.
[35:52.080 --> 35:56.880]  And what is happening over time is that the entire response to COVID and everything that
[35:56.880 --> 36:01.960]  we were told about it from the beginning is being exposed and it's falling apart.
[36:01.960 --> 36:07.400]  The lies are coming apart and really now there's no justification for putting people out of
[36:07.400 --> 36:13.600]  their jobs or forcing vaccine mandates for a disease that ultimately is very treatable.
[36:13.600 --> 36:15.200]  It's cheap to treat.
[36:15.200 --> 36:19.560]  Medicines are available all over the world and it has death rates that compare very much
[36:19.560 --> 36:21.160]  to seasonal flu.
[36:21.160 --> 36:25.960]  And so in that moment, what you see on Dr. Fauci, this is what people say to me, that
[36:25.960 --> 36:27.800]  he doesn't represent science to them.
[36:27.800 --> 36:35.080]  He represents Joseph Mengele, the Nazi doctor who did experiments on Jews during the Second
[36:35.080 --> 36:37.240]  World War and in the concentration camps.
[36:37.240 --> 36:41.920]  And I am talking about people all across the world are saying this because the response
[36:41.920 --> 36:47.320]  from COVID, what it has done to countries everywhere, what it has done to civil liberties,
[36:47.320 --> 36:53.720]  the suicide rates, the poverty, it has obliterated economies, the level of suffering that has
[36:53.720 --> 37:00.360]  been created because of this disease is now being seen in the cold light of day, i.e.
[37:00.360 --> 37:01.360]  the truth.
[37:01.360 --> 37:04.800]  And people see that there's no justification for what is being done.
[37:04.800 --> 37:09.160]  So as they're being exposed and the control is slipping away, lo and behold, in other
[37:09.160 --> 37:10.680]  variants surfaces.
[37:10.680 --> 37:15.240]  And nobody should be surprised by that because there will be more variants until the end
[37:15.240 --> 37:16.240]  of time.
[37:16.240 --> 37:17.240]  We'll never be free of them.
[37:17.240 --> 37:23.800]  And next hour, I'm going to go through over 30 articles, mainstream saying it's wonderful,
[37:23.800 --> 37:26.440]  we're finally going to arrest people that don't take the shot and take their children
[37:26.440 --> 37:28.080]  and forcibly inject them.
[37:28.080 --> 37:35.040]  CNN, MSNBC, ABC News, London Telegraph, you see suddenly, we're not partway into the
[37:35.040 --> 37:36.600]  New World Order.
[37:36.600 --> 37:42.360]  We are deep, deep, deep, just suddenly, oh, yeah, Australia is going to start taking
[37:42.360 --> 37:47.000]  the children, they're already going to arrest old ladies outside walking their dog, oh,
[37:47.000 --> 37:50.920]  the police are out with six foot poles to keep people apart in the streets.
[37:50.920 --> 37:57.200]  I mean, this is real harassment by the state, by the system using the pretext that they're
[37:57.200 --> 38:01.800]  protecting you from a virus, their bosses cooked up and released for control and all
[38:01.800 --> 38:04.960]  these useful idiots don't understand morals or common sense.
[38:04.960 --> 38:08.480]  So they're all the nanny state taking your rights away to keep you safe.
[38:08.480 --> 38:13.880]  But Australia has the highest numbers of illnesses and deaths ever supposedly.
[38:13.880 --> 38:17.640]  And of course, it's the vaccinated, they admit that account for 90% of the sick and dying.
[38:17.640 --> 38:20.200]  Their answer is more shots.
[38:20.200 --> 38:24.520]  Australia suffers deadliest day of pandemic as Omnicron drives up hospital cases.
[38:24.520 --> 38:27.960]  That's all coming up.
[38:27.960 --> 38:37.240]  But first, let's go to this really sickening evil owner of the Warriors saying genocide
[38:37.240 --> 38:38.240]  is not happening.
[38:38.240 --> 38:41.920]  So CCP is in a dictatorship and the US is quote, no better.
[38:41.920 --> 38:43.720]  Well, we're becoming no better with our leadership.
[38:43.720 --> 38:47.000]  You're right because of people like you that have no morals, you little demon preaching
[38:47.000 --> 38:48.000]  to us to not care.
[38:48.000 --> 38:49.640]  So see, oh, yeah, they got death camps.
[38:49.640 --> 38:50.640]  So what?
[38:50.640 --> 38:51.840]  We're building them to here.
[38:51.840 --> 38:52.840]  Oh, all right.
[38:52.840 --> 38:53.840]  See, that's globalism.
[38:53.840 --> 38:57.680]  Does credit America bring down our rights, our freedoms, our basic liberties?
[38:57.680 --> 38:59.720]  And then say, oh, it's all bad.
[38:59.720 --> 39:00.720]  Just get rid of it.
[39:00.720 --> 39:03.760]  In fact, liberty was the vice.
[39:03.760 --> 39:09.880]  So here's a well-known basketball player, Ian's canner on Tucker Carlson, countering
[39:09.880 --> 39:11.040]  this BS last night.
[39:11.040 --> 39:14.960]  I'm just telling you a very hard, you're saying you personally don't care.
[39:14.960 --> 39:16.880]  I'm telling you a very hard, ugly truth.
[39:16.880 --> 39:17.880]  Okay.
[39:17.880 --> 39:18.880]  Of all the things that I care about.
[39:18.880 --> 39:21.440]  Yes, it is below my line.
[39:21.440 --> 39:25.200]  We're a pulse of human being, obviously.
[39:25.200 --> 39:27.320]  You got to kind of admire his honesty.
[39:27.320 --> 39:30.160]  Can't be honest.
[39:30.160 --> 39:31.160]  We're glad he was.
[39:31.160 --> 39:34.080]  So the Golden State Warriors issued a statement that read this way.
[39:34.080 --> 39:36.600]  Mr. Polly Epikia does not speak on behalf of our franchise.
[39:36.600 --> 39:40.280]  And of course, the billionaire himself issued a statement saying, well, I, my family came
[39:40.280 --> 39:41.640]  from a country with mean people.
[39:41.640 --> 39:47.200]  And by the way, the United States is human rights abuses too, even more impulsive than
[39:47.200 --> 39:48.200]  you would ever imagine.
[39:48.200 --> 39:51.600]  Of course, the Golden State Warriors didn't even mention the Uighurs in their statement.
[39:51.600 --> 39:53.440]  You wouldn't want to upset China.
[39:53.440 --> 39:54.440]  Say the word, I won.
[39:54.440 --> 39:55.440]  We dare you.
[39:55.440 --> 39:59.080]  You just can't, your freedom knows a lot about how this all works.
[39:59.080 --> 40:00.440]  He plays for the Boston Celtics.
[40:00.440 --> 40:01.880]  He recently became an American citizen.
[40:01.880 --> 40:02.880]  He's very proud of that.
[40:02.880 --> 40:05.560]  The second time he's joined us and we're glad he's here.
[40:05.560 --> 40:08.680]  Mr. Freedom, thank you very much for coming on tonight.
[40:08.680 --> 40:14.000]  So to hear someone say it, oh, I like your shirt, to see someone say that as clearly
[40:14.000 --> 40:18.320]  as this owner just did, like, I don't care if they're murdered by the government of China.
[40:18.320 --> 40:21.120]  How do you feel when you see that?
[40:21.120 --> 40:26.680]  I remember we had a game today at 1230 and my manager texted me this video right before
[40:26.680 --> 40:27.920]  the game.
[40:27.920 --> 40:29.920]  And first of all, I couldn't believe it.
[40:29.920 --> 40:34.680]  I was very angry, very disgusted and very disappointed.
[40:34.680 --> 40:41.160]  And you know, his comments were so, I was like, I couldn't focus on the game because
[40:41.160 --> 40:42.160]  of his comments.
[40:42.160 --> 40:46.640]  I mean, you look at the Uyghur people, what's happened to the Uyghurs is one of the worst
[40:46.640 --> 40:50.920]  human right abuses in the world today and there's a genocide happening while we're talking
[40:50.920 --> 40:51.920]  right now.
[40:51.920 --> 40:57.440]  And him going out there and saying, I could care less, it's a shame and it is disgusting.
[40:57.440 --> 41:02.920]  I mean, so you just became an American citizen to see the most privileged, the richest people
[41:02.920 --> 41:03.920]  in our society.
[41:03.920 --> 41:04.920]  Anyway, just say it out loud.
[41:04.920 --> 41:09.080]  Like, I don't care about anybody but myself making money, having power over this country.
[41:09.080 --> 41:13.640]  I mean, that must be kind of discouraging as someone who just got here.
[41:13.640 --> 41:18.560]  You know, you know, the funny thing is this guy, this guy owns a company called actually
[41:18.560 --> 41:24.360]  I have it right here called Social Capital where they pretend to care about social values
[41:24.360 --> 41:26.440]  and this is a virtue signal.
[41:26.440 --> 41:29.040]  And I have all those recordings here with me.
[41:29.040 --> 41:33.720]  He pretends to care about others, but the only thing he cares about is money and promoting
[41:33.720 --> 41:35.920]  the CCP propaganda.
[41:35.920 --> 41:41.680]  And it makes me sick how he's using social justice to make money for Forestry Company.
[41:41.680 --> 41:43.560]  And I want to ask him one question.
[41:43.560 --> 41:48.040]  You know, one question, if your mother, if your daughter, if your sister was in those
[41:48.040 --> 41:52.360]  concentration camps and get in torture and gang rape every day, would you still think
[41:52.360 --> 41:53.360]  about money?
[41:53.360 --> 41:55.560]  Would you still, would you still remain silent?
[41:55.560 --> 41:57.320]  So I want him to answer that question.
[41:57.320 --> 41:58.320]  Yeah.
[41:58.320 --> 41:59.600]  I mean, greed is a sin.
[41:59.600 --> 42:00.920]  People used to say that out loud.
[42:00.920 --> 42:05.120]  You know, whenever says that out loud now, but you obviously understand it.
[42:05.120 --> 42:09.720]  And I'm so, I'm so glad you said that and I'm so glad you're in this country.
[42:09.720 --> 42:13.040]  The system only lets you become this rich and powerful in almost all cases unless you're
[42:13.040 --> 42:14.960]  totally evil and corrupt.
[42:14.960 --> 42:18.040]  That's why the middle class and the independently wealthy out there have to pour your money
[42:18.040 --> 42:20.800]  and energy into fighting this where you're going to lose everything.
[42:20.800 --> 42:27.840]  I mean, it's now down to the wire and people inside the Chinese government leaked hours
[42:27.840 --> 42:32.440]  and hours of footage of them being loaded on trains, taken and executed, bags over their
[42:32.440 --> 42:38.840]  heads, thousands a day if they don't work properly in the slave camps for Apple.
[42:38.840 --> 42:41.040]  And it's like, well, hey, it's all right if Tim Cook says it's fine.
[42:41.040 --> 42:42.040]  I mean, Tim Cook's gay.
[42:42.040 --> 42:43.040]  I mean, he can run death camps.
[42:43.040 --> 42:44.040]  I mean, come on.
[42:44.040 --> 42:47.240]  I mean, he's allowed to death camps.
[42:47.240 --> 42:51.360]  So that's where this is all going, ladies and gentlemen, and it's very, very frightening.
[42:51.360 --> 42:53.560]  And if we let this happen to them, it's going to happen to all of us.
[42:53.560 --> 42:55.720]  All right, they're trying to start World War Three with Russia.
[42:55.720 --> 42:57.400]  The Pentagon says it's imminent.
[42:57.400 --> 42:58.400]  So cover that.
[42:58.400 --> 42:59.400]  We come back.
[42:59.400 --> 43:02.320]  Christmas 2021 is gone.
[43:02.320 --> 43:07.480]  It's in the rearview mirror, but you can still take advantage of Christmas prices going

[44:12.640 --> 44:20.040]  Then our God will reward us with eternal life.
[44:20.040 --> 44:24.520]  That's basically the ethos of the globalists.
[44:24.520 --> 44:30.560]  They must first play God, they must first prove that they are the fittest in their social
[44:30.560 --> 44:31.560]  Darwinistic system.
[44:31.560 --> 44:37.720]  And in a way they're right, if we let them lie to us and dumb us down and poison us and
[44:37.720 --> 44:41.400]  destroy our children's futures, the evidence is overwhelming and out in the open.
[44:41.400 --> 44:45.120]  We really deserve what's happened to us.
[44:45.120 --> 44:51.440]  So I ask you now, are you going to step up and expose the new order even more?
[44:51.440 --> 44:55.280]  I know I'm pledging to step up and redouble my efforts.

[45:59.120 --> 46:03.920]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalist.
[46:03.920 --> 46:05.960]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[46:05.960 --> 46:11.680]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational.
[46:11.680 --> 46:12.680]  But we failed.
[46:12.680 --> 46:14.120]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[46:14.120 --> 46:19.920]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat footed, but they are going ahead with their full operational
[46:19.920 --> 46:22.280]  deindustrialization great reset.
[46:22.280 --> 46:26.580]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody
[46:26.580 --> 46:31.200]  they know about the show because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[46:31.200 --> 46:34.080]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy and trying to stop their agenda.
[46:34.080 --> 46:36.240]  But we've also got to get personally prepared.
[46:36.240 --> 46:38.960]  And one of the number one things to do is high quality, storeable food.
[46:38.960 --> 46:44.040]  We've got the best food ready to ship at very affordable prices at infowarstore.com.

[47:00.680 --> 47:24.680]  Meeting of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:24.680 --> 47:35.520]  From Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, the Alex Jones show.
[47:35.520 --> 47:41.520]  Trying to make the scene.
[47:41.520 --> 47:51.520]  Stars faking the banner, blood of the industry, time hustles those who wait to die, time hustles
[47:51.520 --> 48:07.280]  those who wait to die, sweet soul sister, ain't going to be no more souls around here.
[48:07.280 --> 48:10.240]  This takeover is successful.
[48:10.240 --> 48:14.000]  Everybody used to seeing people disappearing to me and taking away or walking down the
[48:14.000 --> 48:17.600]  street without their mask on or without their vaccine back for it.
[48:17.600 --> 48:22.880]  You don't want the government to put this experimental shot in you, it's killed so many.
[48:22.880 --> 48:25.520]  You're going to prison, baby.
[48:25.520 --> 48:36.040]  It doesn't matter where you are in the world, it's all run by the Carnegie Endowment.
[48:36.040 --> 48:38.240]  They finally made their move.
[48:38.240 --> 48:44.880]  You can pretend all day you're going to be all right going along with the system, but
[48:44.880 --> 48:50.600]  you're not going to be and you're going to find out faster and faster how dead on I am.
[48:50.600 --> 48:54.000]  100% certain because I got all the documents.
[48:54.000 --> 48:57.600]  All right, let's get into it right now.
[48:57.600 --> 49:00.400]  And there's so much news, it's just incredible next hour.
[49:00.400 --> 49:05.160]  And then we have Ali Alexander joining us in the third hour and so much more today.
[49:05.160 --> 49:14.760]  Paul Joseph Watson will host the fourth hour, head of Owen Schreuer in the war.
[49:14.760 --> 49:19.520]  There is already a proxy war that's been going on for approximately three years, a little
[49:19.520 --> 49:24.800]  bit longer than that, but physically as U.S. military advises Ukrainian troops battling
[49:24.800 --> 49:34.400]  what's known as little green men and the little green men are Russian troops or Spitznets.
[49:34.400 --> 49:38.840]  Now I have that from sources, but it's also well known and it's been in the newspapers
[49:38.840 --> 49:41.080]  on both sides.
[49:41.080 --> 49:48.600]  It's a overt war that was covered and the Russians grabbed Ukraine that is the seat
[49:48.600 --> 49:56.560]  of the founding of Russia almost a thousand years ago.
[49:56.560 --> 50:01.800]  And so it would basically be like during World War I and World War II, we went back and
[50:01.800 --> 50:06.360]  forth, but there's been periods of time where Ukraine has been in the hands of Europe and
[50:06.360 --> 50:08.000]  as those empires battled.
[50:08.000 --> 50:17.040]  But Eastern Ukraine is undoubtedly the founding place of Russia and what is Russian culture
[50:17.040 --> 50:19.720]  and systems today.
[50:19.720 --> 50:24.720]  And the main Russian culture that dominates the rest of the largest country in the world
[50:24.720 --> 50:31.600]  is in the West and that's the European arm of the culture that's Russian.
[50:31.600 --> 50:39.240]  But the first modernization was about a thousand years ago when several individuals was named
[50:39.240 --> 50:46.280]  Slava's Law of the Wise, I always butchered Slavic words, I apologize, but he set up
[50:46.280 --> 50:52.720]  the modern reading and writing and things and Russia had been a Viking stronghold and
[50:52.720 --> 50:58.800]  there were some Viking castles and Viking systems that were based there, but they then
[50:58.800 --> 51:07.640]  picked up from the wise what their system was and I'm not going to go into a long history
[51:07.640 --> 51:13.120]  thing on it, I've just read over it, it's fascinating stuff, but what they're trying
[51:13.120 --> 51:19.320]  to do right now is take over historically what has been part of Russia since its founding.
[51:19.320 --> 51:24.920]  Now you can argue that Western Ukraine, you know, World War II, Western Ukraine was with
[51:24.920 --> 51:32.720]  the Nazis and they're blonde-haired blue-eyed and more German, but the point is that Russia
[51:32.720 --> 51:39.000]  was founded in Ukraine and in Eastern Ukraine and they see it being taken and their main
[51:39.000 --> 51:42.520]  pipelines into Europe being taken and it's very strategic, so you don't need to be a
[51:42.520 --> 51:50.000]  Russophile to say that it's Russia's prerogative to defend that and Russia has said they will
[51:50.000 --> 51:56.680]  and here is the former four-star general, main Fox News military analyst, Jack Keen,
[51:56.680 --> 52:03.400]  on with Larry Kudlow, I'm not going to play the whole thing, the full things on infowars.com,
[52:03.400 --> 52:07.760]  saying oh yeah, Biden's right, the Russians are going to launch a false flag, it's already
[52:07.760 --> 52:12.000]  begun and attack their own forces and they're going to invade and they're going to take
[52:12.000 --> 52:15.640]  Eastern Ukraine, I don't think they'll take the whole thing and now Britain's putting
[52:15.640 --> 52:19.880]  troops in, NATO's putting troops in and they then discuss maybe going ahead and just attacking
[52:19.880 --> 52:25.000]  the Russian troops with NATO.
[52:25.000 --> 52:30.920]  When you talk about communist or evil, Russia is not doing a vaccine passport, Russia is
[52:30.920 --> 52:35.720]  not doing force inoculation, Russia said no to all this and I'm not saying Russia is a
[52:35.720 --> 52:41.840]  wonderful blazer, you know, run by perfect saints, but Russia is more American than America
[52:41.840 --> 52:50.920]  is in blue cities and Russia is more European than Europe is now.
[52:50.920 --> 52:55.760]  So that's the reality of what's going on, not some bull, so here's General Keen, he's
[52:55.760 --> 52:59.720]  all tough, he's conservative, well he agrees with Biden, there's going to be a false flag.
[52:59.720 --> 53:03.200]  Imagine when I would talk about false flags 20 years ago, the media said that doesn't
[53:03.200 --> 53:04.200]  exist.
[53:04.200 --> 53:07.920]  Well they got declassified by Wiki, leaks that the army teaches green beret captains
[53:07.920 --> 53:13.440]  it up, how to stage false flags, so I can assure you that in all of military history
[53:13.440 --> 53:18.560]  staging stuff to blame your enemy is the bread and the butter when you want to force
[53:18.560 --> 53:24.440]  multiply a bunch of people and there's a lot of evil stuff that's gone on and all major
[53:24.440 --> 53:29.840]  governments do it and I have no doubt that the Russians will probably blow up one of
[53:29.840 --> 53:33.520]  their own bases and sacrifice a few hundred troops or something to say Ukraine did it,
[53:33.520 --> 53:37.080]  but they don't need to because Ukraine is attacking and the US is attacking, so what
[53:37.080 --> 53:40.800]  they're saying is oh we're going to attack, we're sending troops in, we've already got
[53:40.800 --> 53:46.520]  troops there, attacking Russians and if the Russians fight back, well it's a false flag
[53:46.520 --> 53:51.160]  and he says we need to pin the rows on them now and explain that it's only them that will
[53:51.160 --> 53:56.160]  attack their forces, even though western forces and NATO are already attacking Russians,
[53:56.160 --> 54:03.040]  Russians have been dying, westerners have been dying, it's all been classified.
[54:03.040 --> 54:07.920]  And why is this so important? Because everything Biden's doing is about a false flag here in
[54:07.920 --> 54:12.440]  the next 294 days ahead of the midterms, the whole thing set, they're preparing it, so
[54:12.440 --> 54:16.280]  I agree with General Keen that governments do prepare false flags, you see the signs,
[54:16.280 --> 54:20.800]  you see the propaganda, you see the preparation that Putin's getting for his people to go
[54:20.800 --> 54:24.920]  to war. Now will he stage a false flag? I don't think he needs that, the Russians are
[54:24.920 --> 54:30.520]  sick of this and know it's their country basically, their birthplace, not just their country,
[54:30.520 --> 54:39.960]  their ethos, their origin story. You know, Superman came from Krypton, Americans came
[54:39.960 --> 54:47.640]  from New York and Virginia, the Russians came from Ukraine, that's their nest, it's the
[54:47.640 --> 54:51.720]  house they were born in and they're being told it's not theirs, that it belongs to Joe
[54:51.720 --> 54:57.000]  Biden's son and so here we are but the fact that Keen has to admit that the ground works
[54:57.000 --> 55:00.960]  being laid and you can see the pre-signs with false flag, well that's how it works, that's
[55:00.960 --> 55:03.880]  how I knew before 9-11 they were about to do it, that's how I know all this because
[55:03.880 --> 55:07.720]  you see the pre-programming first and yeah, they're telling you now that we're already
[55:07.720 --> 55:11.480]  at war with Russia and within the middle of this month, the middle of next month it's
[55:11.480 --> 55:14.920]  going to start and Putin's going in because they know they're not going to stop, they're
[55:14.920 --> 55:19.040]  expanding NATO, they're expanding color revolutions all over the place, they've got operatives
[55:19.040 --> 55:22.880]  all over the former Soviet Union and you're going to see an attempted overthrow of the
[55:22.880 --> 55:28.800]  Russian government very, very soon and the Russians put their nuclear subs on alert,
[55:28.800 --> 55:31.280]  they announced the world three weeks ago, they launched them and they've got them all
[55:31.280 --> 55:35.320]  around the US coastlines and we're like well we got more than them, we'll kill them better,
[55:35.320 --> 55:41.000]  yeah great, they've only got 20,000 warheads and we've got 50,000 warheads, this is wonderful,
[55:41.000 --> 55:45.000]  let's kill everybody and then the best part about a nuclear war is the nuclear power plants
[55:45.000 --> 55:48.440]  are going to go down even if they're not hit and then when they go down, they melt down
[55:48.440 --> 55:52.700]  and they're thousands of times worse than a hydrogen bomb because hydrogen bomb dissipates
[55:52.700 --> 55:59.520]  almost all its radiation, nuclear reactors done, this is a gross analogy, a hydrogen
[55:59.520 --> 56:03.520]  bomb blows up and burns up your city, has a little bit of fallout but it's the equivalent
[56:03.520 --> 56:13.160]  of passing gas with radiation, a major reactor melting down and blowing up is the equivalent
[56:13.160 --> 56:19.920]  of a major city sewage treatment plant blowing up, that's how much more crap there is, okay
[56:19.920 --> 56:25.920]  and this is untenable, unlivable, suicide, insane asylum, crazy town but that's where
[56:25.920 --> 56:32.440]  we are because there is a demonic, evil force that wants to destroy life on planet and wants
[56:32.440 --> 56:37.280]  us to decapitate our children's genitals, wants us to turn our little boys into girls,
[56:37.280 --> 56:42.240]  wants us to do all this and Russia and China are saying no and they've got their own problems
[56:42.240 --> 56:47.080]  but they are not slowing the satanic energy quite like our leaders, I'll start the next
[56:47.080 --> 56:51.320]  hour with what General Keen had to say but let's just play the first minute now because
[56:51.320 --> 56:53.680]  this is amazing, here it is.
[56:53.680 --> 57:00.480]  I'm particularly interested and I guess disturbed to get your take on it, this talk about a
[57:00.480 --> 57:06.680]  false flag operation that suddenly the White House is saying mid January to mid February
[57:06.680 --> 57:12.920]  and oil markets around the world are now seizing up so you're up about ten or twelve bucks
[57:12.920 --> 57:18.760]  just in the last few days, what do you make of it General Keen?
[57:18.760 --> 57:24.960]  Well I believe it to be sure, the administration is releasing classified information that they
[57:24.960 --> 57:27.320]  have and I think they're doing absolutely the right thing here.
[57:27.320 --> 57:30.200]  We're going to come back the next hour with all this, so see how everything I told you
[57:30.200 --> 57:33.720]  all these years is down in the open and it's not about I'm right, I focus on the actual
[57:33.720 --> 57:39.240]  leaders and what they're doing, not off OCNN, ABC News and all the crap they feed you but
[57:39.240 --> 57:43.920]  now we've got to the point where it's finally the end game, World War 4, all of it and it's
[57:43.920 --> 57:52.360]  just insane because the bad guys are running our country.
[57:52.360 --> 57:57.200]  Inside you, like me, a fire is burning, something needs to change.
[57:57.200 --> 58:02.160]  I just want to reach out and give a recommendation to Reset Wars, it's really powerful.
[58:02.160 --> 58:07.840]  Reset Wars was absolutely amazing and eye opening and revolutionary.
[58:07.840 --> 58:13.040]  If you want to change your life for the better, I highly recommend this to Alex, thank you
[58:13.040 --> 58:17.560]  very much for putting the course together, I found it to be awesome, it was worth it
[58:17.560 --> 58:18.560]  to me.
[58:18.560 --> 58:24.440]  You have taken ancient wisdom and ancient knowledge and crystallized it with scientific
[58:24.440 --> 58:25.440]  knowledge.
[58:25.440 --> 58:30.480]  This isn't about Alex Jones, so what you're about to see is a lengthy, powerful, well
[58:30.480 --> 58:36.680]  documented spectrum of information and experiences and understanding that the power structure
[58:36.680 --> 58:38.960]  is censoring and is definitely afraid of.
[58:38.960 --> 58:44.120]  To think the way we are intended to think by God, that's what this series is about.
[58:44.120 --> 58:49.200]  Reset Wars has been a great tool during this time of uncertainty and it has rejuvenated
[58:49.200 --> 58:50.200]  my hope.
[58:50.200 --> 58:54.800]  It's been helping me a lot with a lot that's going on in my life.
[58:54.800 --> 58:58.720]  Everybody needs to purchase this product and watch it and then share the information far
[58:58.720 --> 58:59.720]  and wide.
[58:59.720 --> 59:05.920]  There is an awakening, join in to help yourself and others to wake up.
[59:05.920 --> 59:12.320]  Reset Wars has been a great tool in both recapping what I've come to already know and also learn
[59:12.320 --> 59:13.320]  new material.
[59:13.320 --> 59:16.840]  I'm not disappointed, I plan on sharing it with as many people as possible.
[59:16.840 --> 59:21.640]  I hear you coming more and more with that and I feel it more and more, it's moving me.
[59:21.640 --> 59:26.120]  We need to have courage and focus in order to accomplish that mission and I felt like
[59:26.120 --> 59:28.680]  I got a lot of that from Reset Wars as well.
[59:28.680 --> 59:32.920]  The confidence and hope gained from Reset Wars is priceless.
[59:32.920 --> 59:39.560]  This isn't magic, this is the real code of the universe or what Max Plank 120 plus years
[59:39.560 --> 59:42.120]  ago called The Matrix.
[59:42.120 --> 59:51.600]  Start your journey to true freedom now at ResetWars.com.
[59:51.600 --> 1:00:07.640]  Beginning of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:00:07.640 --> 1:00:25.880]  From Azeris became a ragtag band to bring a revolution.
[1:00:25.880 --> 1:00:35.200]  Some would make them change, others wouldn't stand for that, the cross was the solution
[1:00:35.200 --> 1:00:37.880]  to the problem.
[1:00:37.880 --> 1:00:44.240]  Wise men follow him.
[1:00:44.240 --> 1:00:52.320]  Wise men all across the world from the US to Canada, from Australia to Germany, people
[1:00:52.320 --> 1:00:57.040]  are being arrested in stores because they're not wearing masks or they're caught not having
[1:00:57.040 --> 1:00:58.640]  their vaccine passport.
[1:00:58.640 --> 1:01:00.760]  The tyranny is here.
[1:01:00.760 --> 1:01:05.960]  We're going to get worse until we say no, first here's a key report we are witnessing
[1:01:05.960 --> 1:01:14.280]  the end of America question mark.
[1:01:14.280 --> 1:01:20.040]  America has been captured by very evil multinational corporate crime syndicate run out of the
[1:01:20.040 --> 1:01:23.680]  Bilderberg group and it's public arm the Debo script.
[1:01:23.680 --> 1:01:29.800]  They are not intending to allow the population of the planet to continue on as it is to say
[1:01:29.800 --> 1:01:35.000]  the least and depopulation is what's been carried out through covert means through the
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:40.320]  so-called vaccine program and that's now coming out and mounted and then you ask the logical
[1:01:40.320 --> 1:01:47.320]  question how did the technocracy engage in this mass murder that's now unfolding with
[1:01:47.320 --> 1:01:52.240]  these slow kill, soft kill weapons, how will they get away with that and the answer is
[1:01:52.240 --> 1:01:58.920]  further destabilization so horrible that you forget the last major insult to the human
[1:01:58.920 --> 1:02:00.240]  ecosystem.
[1:02:00.240 --> 1:02:05.440]  So we are being treated as a disease as a cancer to be cut out and the big lie is people
[1:02:05.440 --> 1:02:10.480]  working for the system believe that they are positioning themselves with the winning team
[1:02:10.480 --> 1:02:15.760]  and that they are going to be taken care of because they are going to execute this operation.
[1:02:15.760 --> 1:02:19.480]  When you read deeper into leaked documents out of the Debo script and Bilderberg group
[1:02:19.480 --> 1:02:25.640]  that we and others got great danger to ourselves, you will then discover that they plan to implode
[1:02:25.640 --> 1:02:30.480]  all the western governments and then even have show trials of the bureaucracies that
[1:02:30.480 --> 1:02:35.560]  are going to engage in the initiation of the civil war that has already begun and not just
[1:02:35.560 --> 1:02:36.920]  here about other parts of the world.
[1:02:36.920 --> 1:02:41.760]  So all the ministers in Australia and ministers in the Netherlands and the UK and the US that
[1:02:41.760 --> 1:02:46.400]  are doing all of this really believe their position because they went to the Debo script
[1:02:46.400 --> 1:02:51.640]  school, they went to the Bilderberg school, they have a school and that they are on the
[1:02:51.640 --> 1:02:55.440]  winning team but if you actually read some of the deeper stuff that they are not given
[1:02:55.440 --> 1:02:59.040]  it, no, they are going to all be wiped out as well and I have a sense of being able to
[1:02:59.040 --> 1:03:03.680]  look myself in the mirror and a sense of that I am starting to measure up to my ancestors
[1:03:03.680 --> 1:03:09.280]  that were pretty amazing people and that I didn't join these scum but that means I will
[1:03:09.280 --> 1:03:13.720]  be set up put in prison or killed very soon and let's just get down to being honest about
[1:03:13.720 --> 1:03:14.720]  this with you, okay?
[1:03:14.720 --> 1:03:17.360]  I don't tell you this, be dramatic, we are at the end of the road here, okay?
[1:03:17.360 --> 1:03:20.880]  It's 298 days out from the election, they are never going to let us have a free or fair
[1:03:20.880 --> 1:03:24.440]  one again and they are going to devalue the dollar, they are going to gut the country
[1:03:24.440 --> 1:03:28.440]  and you just need to get right with God and realize we are being judged for abortion.
[1:03:28.440 --> 1:03:33.440]  I also want to say that I am not offensively, as I told you, going to be involved in any
[1:03:33.440 --> 1:03:37.880]  type of military operations, you are going to obviously hear that when they say it's
[1:03:37.880 --> 1:03:43.760]  terror attacks, they are already blaming myself and Rush Limbaugh posthumously in his case
[1:03:43.760 --> 1:03:49.720]  for the January 6 fiasco and the provocatory false flag extravaganza.
[1:03:49.720 --> 1:04:00.560]  They are supposed to be horrified by the protesters, meanwhile, four years of a coup
[1:04:00.560 --> 1:04:09.800]  launched in the Oval Office of Barack Obama to overturn the election results of 2016 and
[1:04:09.800 --> 1:04:17.400]  not a single word of concern about the potential damage to our Constitution.
[1:04:17.400 --> 1:04:22.800]  There's a reason 75 million people voted for Trump, there's a reason that when he made
[1:04:22.800 --> 1:04:30.320]  that trip down the escalator on June 5th of 2015, there is a reason that he had majority
[1:04:30.320 --> 1:04:36.240]  support in the Republican Party and that is the people that voted for Trump know exactly
[1:04:36.240 --> 1:04:40.000]  what the left has been doing to our country, it has nothing to do with race, it has nothing
[1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:45.160]  to do with white supremacy, nothing to do with white this or that, it has to do with
[1:04:45.160 --> 1:04:48.560]  the left destroying western civilization.
[1:04:48.560 --> 1:04:53.320]  And so I just, I have to really just get down to brass tacks with you and say this is the
[1:04:53.320 --> 1:04:59.640]  end of the line, okay?
[1:04:59.640 --> 1:05:05.520]  Christmas 2021 is over, but you still got a really great chance to give yourself the
[1:05:05.520 --> 1:05:09.960]  gift of free speech and liberty and freedom into the new year, while at the same time

[1:06:12.480 --> 1:06:27.320]  are the resistance. You're listening to Alex Jones. So a lot of people seem to think that
[1:06:27.320 --> 1:06:32.120]  if you storm the US Capitol and act like an idiot, that you're going to defeat the new
[1:06:32.120 --> 1:06:38.440]  world order. Not a lot of people. We had a million people there in DC. And when Trump
[1:06:38.440 --> 1:06:41.800]  said go to the Capitol, there's already 100 plus thousand marching there about 200 plus
[1:06:41.800 --> 1:06:46.120]  thousand got there. And out of that, a few hundred attack police, the police basically
[1:06:46.120 --> 1:06:51.760]  were ordered to stand down. A thousand plus armed FBI watched, we now know, from the buildings
[1:06:51.760 --> 1:06:55.880]  around it, let the attack take place, let people break in and then had the police wave
[1:06:55.880 --> 1:06:59.400]  in the crowd knowing the crowd didn't know that they would then be charged for going
[1:06:59.400 --> 1:07:05.360]  in and walking between the velvet ropes. True criminal activity, a true false flag against
[1:07:05.360 --> 1:07:15.600]  America by opening the door, by putting your baby, say, in a pit of alligators. You didn't
[1:07:15.600 --> 1:07:20.360]  eat the baby, you didn't physically kill the baby, but you knew the alligators were going
[1:07:20.360 --> 1:07:24.800]  to get hungry when that baby was crying and making noise and come over and eat it. And
[1:07:24.800 --> 1:07:32.360]  that's what they did. Their minimum was stand down on 9 11 and stand down with cities burned
[1:07:32.360 --> 1:07:36.880]  across this country in the summer 2000 and stand down when the fentanyl was getting
[1:07:36.880 --> 1:07:42.440]  shipped in and follow their illegal orders to stand down and over a thousand armed FBI,
[1:07:42.440 --> 1:07:48.360]  including 300 plus HRT, highly trained commandos. The very best of our military gets into that
[1:07:48.360 --> 1:07:54.880]  program. And they just stood there while a couple hundred thugs, mainly Antifa and others
[1:07:54.880 --> 1:07:59.960]  broke through and went in. Now, why am I making such a big deal about that? I'll cover it
[1:07:59.960 --> 1:08:07.240]  next segment, but Biden has officially had his minions say that it is the fault of his
[1:08:07.240 --> 1:08:13.200]  constituents that the tyranny isn't working properly. That's what you really see from
[1:08:13.200 --> 1:08:18.480]  the most corrupt regimes. That clip's coming up. But I have this whole stack of new news
[1:08:18.480 --> 1:08:22.000]  here where they're declaring the American people terrorist and saying they got to round
[1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:27.320]  up all the conservatives while there's headlines about round up the unvaccinated and put them
[1:08:27.320 --> 1:08:32.760]  in camps and take their children away. The majority of Democrats in a Rasmussen poll
[1:08:32.760 --> 1:08:42.800]  want to put 48% and because you had 15% Republicans, it's a large portion of people want to put
[1:08:42.800 --> 1:08:51.040]  the un-injected in camps. See, it's not camps coming. It's camps that are here. And what's
[1:08:51.040 --> 1:08:58.400]  the backdrop of the camps? The global financial crisis, global hyperinflation beginning,
[1:08:58.400 --> 1:09:05.320]  stagflation, signs everywhere, a depression in the economy. Well, at the same time, there's
[1:09:05.320 --> 1:09:11.440]  not enough goods and services and massive price increases. China threatening to take
[1:09:11.440 --> 1:09:15.080]  Hong Kong and Taiwan already moving into the Philippines, moving into Vietnam, grabbing
[1:09:15.080 --> 1:09:21.080]  islands in Vietnam, grabbing islands in the Philippines. War's already begun. And of all
[1:09:21.080 --> 1:09:24.880]  the factions, we have the worst people running our country because they hate us more than
[1:09:24.880 --> 1:09:32.080]  the Chinese or the Russians. And you had the backdrop then of General Keen forced our
[1:09:32.080 --> 1:09:37.920]  General Top Fox military analyst telling the truth that false flags are a real thing.
[1:09:37.920 --> 1:09:41.560]  They really happen and you see the signs of them and that most major wars start with a
[1:09:41.560 --> 1:09:46.520]  false flag. World War I started with one, with the crown prince, the Austrian and Hungarian
[1:09:46.520 --> 1:09:53.520]  Empire being killed. World War II started with false flags. Look it up. Operation Gliwitz,
[1:09:53.520 --> 1:09:59.560]  Operation Hemler. These are real things I'm saying. I don't just mutter stuff here. And
[1:09:59.560 --> 1:10:04.320]  it's all lining up the same way again. But then there's the globalist corporations posing
[1:10:04.320 --> 1:10:08.720]  as the good guys above running the biomedical attack on everybody while they get ready to
[1:10:08.720 --> 1:10:14.280]  distract us with this attack. So Saki came out. Let's play the Saki clip. I never got
[1:10:14.280 --> 1:10:18.880]  to this today, but I want to play it. Let's play the Saki clip first. Don't play the General
[1:10:18.880 --> 1:10:23.920]  Keen clip next. But she says, we have information that indicates Russia has already prepositioned
[1:10:23.920 --> 1:10:29.040]  a group of operatives to conduct a false flag operation in eastern Ukraine. Now, I don't
[1:10:29.040 --> 1:10:34.840]  believe a word comes out of her mouth, but if you think the Russians won't stage a false
[1:10:34.840 --> 1:10:37.920]  flag to get their people fully behind a war, if they think they're about to go into World
[1:10:37.920 --> 1:10:41.840]  War IV and they got their nuke subs raided, yeah, I think Putin probably would kill a
[1:10:41.840 --> 1:10:45.880]  couple of other groups. I think the even the troops in the main military will probably
[1:10:45.880 --> 1:10:49.920]  know what happened. It's just called a sacrifice. And if you're going to kill people and upon
[1:10:49.920 --> 1:10:53.920]  sacrifice like this, you got a mess classic going back thousands of years where they
[1:10:53.920 --> 1:10:58.320]  would piss their troops off by sitting a small contingent out as a probe, knowing they'd
[1:10:58.320 --> 1:11:02.240]  be wiped out just to watch their troops get killed. They knew would piss their armies
[1:11:02.240 --> 1:11:06.200]  off. That's how men used to be. Nowadays, men saw their men getting killed. They'd
[1:11:06.200 --> 1:11:09.960]  piss themselves. The old days, all over the world, you saw your buddies getting killed.
[1:11:09.960 --> 1:11:13.680]  You got into a rage. So this is how war is done, folks. Let's just grow up and admit
[1:11:13.680 --> 1:11:19.280]  it. But the fact that, I bet Russia probably is getting ready to stage something. But regardless,
[1:11:19.280 --> 1:11:25.200]  it's the globalists that moved their forces in first. And when Russian troops get attacked,
[1:11:25.200 --> 1:11:27.880]  regardless, they're going to say it wasn't an attack. So it could be a false flag. It
[1:11:27.880 --> 1:11:34.600]  could be a false flag. But how big is it that they're admitting false flags in the toolshed?
[1:11:34.600 --> 1:11:38.320]  Let's say you got a big tractor and a little tractor and a small tiller. They're getting
[1:11:38.320 --> 1:11:47.120]  the big tractor out. This is for big war. This didn't get in the little hand tiller
[1:11:47.120 --> 1:11:51.520]  out. This didn't get in the little paring knife out. They're getting the big butcher
[1:11:51.520 --> 1:11:57.600]  knife out. All because of the hutzpah and bravada of the globalists. They just can't
[1:11:57.600 --> 1:12:01.080]  stop pushing. They can't stop grabbing because they got to have their world government. They
[1:12:01.080 --> 1:12:05.200]  got to have their depopulation. They can't have Russians taking a different vaccine
[1:12:05.200 --> 1:12:09.040]  than us and we all die and the Russians live. This is a plan to kill almost everybody. This
[1:12:09.040 --> 1:12:15.320]  is a new world order. Got to make room for Saki and Obama and Lord Rothschild. They're
[1:12:15.320 --> 1:12:20.320]  the annoying ones. They're in the sick freak club with McCron. Got to make room for the
[1:12:20.320 --> 1:12:23.920]  CIA director who's running all this. Here it is.
[1:12:23.920 --> 1:12:28.880]  We have information that indicates Russia has already prepositioned a group of operatives
[1:12:28.880 --> 1:12:33.680]  to conduct a false flag operation in eastern Ukraine. The operatives are trained in urban
[1:12:33.680 --> 1:12:39.040]  warfare and in using explosives to carry out acts of sabotage against Russia's own proxy
[1:12:39.040 --> 1:12:43.840]  forces. Our information also indicates that Russian influence actors are already starting
[1:12:43.840 --> 1:12:49.400]  to fabricate Ukrainian provocations in state and social media to justify a Russian intervention
[1:12:49.400 --> 1:12:54.280]  and so divisions in Ukraine. I'm particularly interested and I guess
[1:12:54.280 --> 1:13:01.000]  disturbed to get your take on it. This talk about a false flag operation that suddenly
[1:13:01.000 --> 1:13:07.800]  the White House is saying mid-January to mid-February and oil markets around the world are now
[1:13:07.800 --> 1:13:13.400]  seizing up. So you're up about $10 or $12 just in the last few days. What do you make
[1:13:13.400 --> 1:13:15.400]  of it, General Keane?
[1:13:15.400 --> 1:13:22.800]  Well, I believe it, to be sure. The administration is releasing classified information that they
[1:13:22.800 --> 1:13:26.480]  have and I think they're doing absolutely the right thing here because we've seen this
[1:13:26.480 --> 1:13:34.160]  pattern before. This is the phase of the operation where Putin attempts to justify why he's going
[1:13:34.160 --> 1:13:39.880]  in with military forces and certainly he's going to create unrest.
[1:13:39.880 --> 1:13:44.680]  Back to 10 seconds. This is the phase of the operation where they're going to create the
[1:13:44.680 --> 1:13:49.880]  false flag. Just like Biden's announcing imminent white supremacist attacks and it's
[1:13:49.880 --> 1:13:54.880]  all Alex Jones' fault. In hundreds of papers, Jones is going to cause a bloody revolution.
[1:13:54.880 --> 1:13:58.600]  It's all his fault. So when they blow stuff up or let some lunatic do something, I get
[1:13:58.600 --> 1:14:03.840]  the blame. And who is Alex Jones of some love, the American people? I'm the deplorable.
[1:14:03.840 --> 1:14:08.880]  I'm not trying to, like, hey, I'm big. I'm the target. I'm telling you this is all being
[1:14:08.880 --> 1:14:13.480]  done for a reason. They're laying all the predicate, all the foundation, all the things.
[1:14:13.480 --> 1:14:18.000]  And I'm just saying I'm not playing. I'm not for any violence. I'm not for any of this.
[1:14:18.000 --> 1:14:21.040]  I don't want the globalist to stabilize our country and start a war. I don't want war
[1:14:21.040 --> 1:14:25.520]  with Russia. I just want to have a human future. I want to love everybody. I want people to
[1:14:25.520 --> 1:14:29.960]  learn how these tricks work so that we stop falling for them. I am not going to be your
[1:14:29.960 --> 1:14:35.000]  puppet. I'm not like these other people that love being the demon in the news and love
[1:14:35.000 --> 1:14:42.000]  being attacked and play along with it. I don't want to be in this garbage. I want it to stop.
[1:14:42.000 --> 1:14:45.760]  I don't want to be a fancy person in D.C. I don't want to be a big Politico. I don't
[1:14:45.760 --> 1:14:49.600]  want to be in L.A. or New York. I don't want to be around you people. I want to just have
[1:14:49.600 --> 1:14:54.920]  a future. And that's why I've been fighting you. You, General Keener, are going to destroy
[1:14:54.920 --> 1:14:59.280]  the planet. You, Kudlow, are going to destroy the planet with all your tough macho stuff
[1:14:59.280 --> 1:15:05.240]  about Russia. If Russia was in Mexico trying to announce that they were going to take half
[1:15:05.240 --> 1:15:10.480]  of Texas, I'd say we got to have a war. They're not in there. It's the globalist conquering
[1:15:10.480 --> 1:15:14.040]  our country with foreigners. It's the globalist breaking our country down. It's the globalist
[1:15:14.040 --> 1:15:17.960]  destroying our dollar. It's the globalist coming after our children, General Keen. Let's
[1:15:17.960 --> 1:15:23.160]  finish up with a little bit of the clip. Because we've seen this pattern before. This is the
[1:15:23.160 --> 1:15:29.600]  phase of the operation where Putin attempts to justify why he's going in with military
[1:15:29.600 --> 1:15:37.840]  forces. And certainly he's going to create unrest, greater unrest in eastern Ukraine
[1:15:37.840 --> 1:15:41.160]  to justify the movement of forces as he's beginning to...
[1:15:41.160 --> 1:15:44.040]  So let's go back to what really happened six years ago. The West went on with proxies,
[1:15:44.040 --> 1:15:48.200]  grips, and George Soros. They declassified it. Soros bragged on, for Eid Zarkaria, that
[1:15:48.200 --> 1:15:51.160]  they put $5 billion of state-apparent money in to overthrow the government and cause a
[1:15:51.160 --> 1:15:55.480]  civil war. So the West causes a civil war, and six years later, it's the Russians fault
[1:15:55.480 --> 1:15:59.480]  we got to have a war with them.
[1:15:59.480 --> 1:16:05.760]  Christmas 2021 is gone. It's in the rearview mirror. But you can still take advantage of

[1:17:12.160 --> 1:17:17.360]  and financial collapse worldwide. Now, ladies and gentlemen, storable food has always been

[1:17:57.800 --> 1:18:06.120]  Get our great bag of it here. I mean, this is from, people say, why is it from Chiapas,
[1:18:06.120 --> 1:18:10.280]  Mexico, the communists? Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's
[1:18:10.280 --> 1:18:15.840]  wild harvested above organic in the volcanic soil, better than Guatemalan coffee. And yeah,
[1:18:15.840 --> 1:18:19.000]  we buy it from the little farmers that, you know, the media calls communists, but really
[1:18:19.000 --> 1:18:22.760]  they're just a commune. And whatever the point is, is that it's good coffee and we've got
[1:18:22.760 --> 1:18:25.920]  it. And the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over. So I actually buy this
[1:18:25.920 --> 1:18:29.200]  from the Mexican rebels and I've been buying it for what, 14 years and the price has never
[1:18:29.200 --> 1:18:33.280]  gone up. The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more per
[1:18:33.280 --> 1:18:36.560]  pound. And I just think it's some of the best coffee you're going to find anywhere. It's
[1:18:36.560 --> 1:18:41.440]  Wake Up America, Patriot Blend from the Chiapas Rebels, literally. In fact, I'm not going
[1:18:41.440 --> 1:18:48.800]  to tell you a little story. We have like that. You wouldn't believe it. Anyway, so it's
[1:18:48.800 --> 1:18:53.600]  infowarstore.com and that's how we fund this operation. And if you don't fund us and don't
[1:18:53.600 --> 1:18:55.960]  want us here, that's fine.
[1:19:24.600 --> 1:19:28.400]  for
[1:19:28.400 --> 1:19:34.560]  electrolytes. It's got real organic cocoa bean powder with natural chocolate flavor and a
[1:19:34.560 --> 1:19:38.240]  touch of sea salt. It even tastes better than last formula. And what it does for your
[1:19:38.240 --> 1:19:44.560]  body is simply amazing. Again, it has that cutting edge chicken broth protein, isolate
[1:19:44.560 --> 1:19:48.840]  powder for better flavor and dissolvability. You're going to love this. And when it does
[1:19:48.840 --> 1:19:52.720]  for your joints, what it does for your body, it does for your bones. It's simply amazing.
[1:19:52.720 --> 1:19:57.200]  And it helps funding infowar. This is really the best bone broth out there. So get yours
[1:19:57.200 --> 1:20:04.320]  at infowarstore.com today, leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[1:20:04.320 --> 1:20:05.720]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:20:12.720 --> 1:20:17.920]  I'm sending out an SOS, my friends, for humanity to come together and realize we're about to
[1:20:17.920 --> 1:20:24.040]  repeat history in a very bad way with massive war. I know for a long time, the average American
[1:20:24.040 --> 1:20:27.640]  hasn't had to fight in a war or hasn't been part of something where you're burying a lot
[1:20:27.640 --> 1:20:31.680]  of your family members really since Vietnam or World War Two in large numbers. There's
[1:20:31.680 --> 1:20:36.400]  still been a lot of sacrifice, not trying to make a lot of that. But this is major war
[1:20:36.400 --> 1:20:43.680]  stuff. And when you've got the Fox News general up there analyst, old cordled war, cold war,
[1:20:43.680 --> 1:20:51.400]  dinosaur, couldn't set up for some reason, cold war, dinosaur, lusting after a new war
[1:20:51.400 --> 1:20:55.080]  and saying that the troops have to go in there and we're about to have a big conflict with
[1:20:55.080 --> 1:21:03.680]  Russia. This is just the stuff that total and complete destruction is made of. And when
[1:21:03.680 --> 1:21:09.080]  I look at everything else that's happening, and I look at the leadership the globalist
[1:21:09.080 --> 1:21:14.280]  have put here in the United States to discredit the United States while they wage war against
[1:21:14.280 --> 1:21:18.520]  Russia, while they wage war against China, while they wage war against African countries,
[1:21:18.520 --> 1:21:26.760]  the globalist are at war with everyone. They're the main power group. They're the corporate
[1:21:26.760 --> 1:21:33.800]  allied wolf packs. They are the new world order infrastructure. What is a globalist?
[1:21:33.800 --> 1:21:39.480]  My 17 year old daughter asked me. And the best answer is a globalist is a member of
[1:21:39.480 --> 1:21:45.560]  the global corporate combine that is attempting to establish a authoritarian world government
[1:21:45.560 --> 1:21:53.440]  whose eventual aim of world government is to be able to carry out a transhumanist revolution
[1:21:53.440 --> 1:21:59.800]  that results in the death of the vast majority of the world population and out of that cataclysm
[1:21:59.800 --> 1:22:06.520]  a new super race. There's your definition. Hope somebody takes that and puts it to print
[1:22:06.520 --> 1:22:11.840]  and gets it out there because that's a very accurate quick two line analysis of what we're
[1:22:11.840 --> 1:22:18.680]  dealing with. What you're told globalism is is kumbaya and everybody loves each other.
[1:22:18.680 --> 1:22:25.680]  No, that's Christ vision. That's Christendom that stabilized areas and did incredible things
[1:22:25.680 --> 1:22:31.040]  even though it was only partially implemented. The other system is predatory and destructive
[1:22:31.040 --> 1:22:34.840]  and if there were only 20 globalists left in the room after we've all been killed, they
[1:22:34.840 --> 1:22:41.400]  would then set about killing each other. There's only room for one conscious entity in their
[1:22:41.400 --> 1:22:47.520]  system, not their wives, not their children, none of it, only them because their religion
[1:22:47.520 --> 1:22:56.040]  is about one thing and that is selfishness or the self being alone. Everything must be
[1:22:56.040 --> 1:23:07.800]  mine, me, me, me, me. Mine. Mine. Like the seagulls in Finding Nemo. Mine. Mine. Except
[1:23:07.800 --> 1:23:14.600]  they'll do anything to get what they want and they won't stop. So you've got to discover
[1:23:14.600 --> 1:23:19.600]  their programs. You've got to discover their operations. You've got to become aware of
[1:23:19.600 --> 1:23:25.320]  what they're doing and you've got to decide whether or not you're going to comply which
[1:23:25.320 --> 1:23:34.200]  greases the skids for their operation. I mean, the globalists call themselves globalists
[1:23:34.200 --> 1:23:40.920]  for 60 years and then we expose their plans and the New York Times says it's a Nazi term.
[1:23:40.920 --> 1:23:46.280]  What? No, the Nazi term is cutting off people's power, saying they're going to de-industrialize,
[1:23:46.280 --> 1:23:50.400]  saying they're going to depopulate, saying they're going to force experimental drugs
[1:23:50.400 --> 1:23:53.640]  on you, saying they're going to track and trace everywhere you go and what you do, saying
[1:23:53.640 --> 1:23:58.160]  they're going to lock people up in camps. Just now my phone's blowing up today. We covered
[1:23:58.160 --> 1:24:04.000]  it last week. But just now my phone's blowing up. Did you see the national rasp, you sent
[1:24:04.000 --> 1:24:08.400]  in-depth national poll of tens of thousands of people where the majority of Democrats
[1:24:08.400 --> 1:24:12.840]  want to take the children away from people that don't take all the shots and put them
[1:24:12.840 --> 1:24:20.000]  in camps? Yeah, I saw that. We covered it on Friday, on Saturday, on Sunday. And we've
[1:24:20.000 --> 1:24:24.520]  got the poll right here. Actually got the raspies and poll itself. It's here in my stack.
[1:24:24.520 --> 1:24:29.920]  But again, that's just the normalization. All the news channels, hey, we've got to arrest
[1:24:29.920 --> 1:24:37.640]  all the anti-vaxxers. And I told you that it started in Spain and it started in Germany
[1:24:37.640 --> 1:24:43.800]  and it started in Australia and New Zealand a year ago. And I said, by 2022, it'll be
[1:24:43.800 --> 1:24:52.120]  coming to America. And now it is. Now it's here. So next segment, I'm going to go over
[1:24:52.120 --> 1:24:55.720]  all of that in great detail. I didn't plug last hour, so I'm going to do it right now
[1:24:55.720 --> 1:25:04.880]  because there's a paradox here. As bad as all this news is, if we don't get healthy
[1:25:04.880 --> 1:25:08.320]  and if we don't get focused and if we don't get in the leadership positions, this thing
[1:25:08.320 --> 1:25:11.880]  is certainly going to win. And as adults, we can't just give up and say, screw it, I'm
[1:25:11.880 --> 1:25:15.800]  going to go fishing and get drunk. Well, you know, let the devil have the earth. The children
[1:25:15.800 --> 1:25:21.360]  don't deserve that and God will count us amongst the evil ones if we know about this and don't
[1:25:21.360 --> 1:25:26.400]  take action. In fact, God says many times in the Holy Scripture that if you know about
[1:25:26.400 --> 1:25:33.560]  evil and don't serve it, but also don't serve good, you're the worst. You are the very God
[1:25:33.560 --> 1:25:39.560]  who hates people that do evil by design and know what they're doing. But people that know
[1:25:39.560 --> 1:25:45.280]  about the evil and decide to just sit there on the sideline, well, God hates cowards. You're
[1:25:45.280 --> 1:25:51.560]  even worse than people at a black Sabbath drinking a baby's blood while it screams for
[1:25:51.560 --> 1:25:56.000]  mommy. Because you know that's going on, but you're too scared of that to do anything
[1:25:56.000 --> 1:26:02.080]  about it. You're too scared to try to stop it. So God is going to put you in a very
[1:26:02.080 --> 1:26:06.960]  special place with other cowards like you. And I wouldn't want to experience eternity
[1:26:06.960 --> 1:26:20.560]  in a void with you people. So it is extremely important. I remember a good friend of mine,
[1:26:20.560 --> 1:26:26.960]  big Hollywood producer with a smart guy. He once said to me, Alex, you're a mess. This
[1:26:26.960 --> 1:26:32.880]  is like in 2009. You don't care about yourself. You're just whatever. I said, yeah, because
[1:26:32.880 --> 1:26:35.640]  it's all going to go down. The depopulation is going to happen soon because the globals
[1:26:35.640 --> 1:26:38.640]  were doing their drill then telling all their people was about to happen. I got that info
[1:26:38.640 --> 1:26:42.280]  from a lot of very credible sources. So I thought it was imminent in just a couple years.
[1:26:42.280 --> 1:26:46.040]  And he said, listen, you don't know how history is going to go. You don't know if all this
[1:26:46.040 --> 1:26:49.600]  is going to happen the way they think it is. You're letting them win by not taking care
[1:26:49.600 --> 1:26:53.440]  of yourself, which I still am not perfect, but I try. If I hadn't heard pulling up then
[1:26:53.440 --> 1:26:56.960]  and exercising and taking supplements and things, I probably wouldn't even be here today because
[1:26:56.960 --> 1:27:00.920]  the stress load I've taken on. So we have to be in the best position. We have to be
[1:27:00.920 --> 1:27:04.200]  the healthiest we can be. We have to have the vitamins and the minerals, the nutrients
[1:27:04.200 --> 1:27:10.440]  that our immune systems crave and must have or we're aiding the enemy and killing ourselves
[1:27:10.440 --> 1:27:15.560]  and letting them win. So it's not just don't be a coward and kill yourself. It's don't
[1:27:15.560 --> 1:27:20.960]  quietly by being neglectful of yourself, kill yourself. And I'm telling myself that I got
[1:27:20.960 --> 1:27:24.320]  to take some time off. I got to exercise. I got to remember to take the supplements or
[1:27:24.320 --> 1:27:29.200]  it doesn't do any good. So we had to end the vitamin mineral fusion sale because it's
[1:27:29.200 --> 1:27:33.720]  there's like 100 canisters left this morning when I checked. More should come in in a few
[1:27:33.720 --> 1:27:37.800]  months. Survival Shield X2 will sell out at current sales rates in the next five days.
[1:27:37.800 --> 1:27:41.840]  I'm going to keep it up for sale for about three more days. More comes in in a few months.
[1:27:41.840 --> 1:27:45.880]  It's amazing. The Deep Earth Crystal iodine, booster immune system, all electrochemical
[1:27:45.880 --> 1:27:54.560]  bacteria in the body. It's essential. Last chance. New year's sale. Only just a few days

[1:28:01.640 --> 1:28:06.960]  20% off. Got a limited shipment in. We told them run as much as you can because they can't
[1:28:06.960 --> 1:28:09.480]  do the full shipments because the supply chain breakdowns, whenever they get enough for just
[1:28:09.480 --> 1:28:13.720]  a couple thousand bottles, they do it. Brain Force Ultra is incredible, clean, focused,
[1:28:13.720 --> 1:28:20.080]  energy next level. It's very fast. Alpha Power, limited supply, 50% off. That's the equivalent

[1:28:24.680 --> 1:28:30.320]  turmeric, liquid extract, 50% off. It's incredible. Very high. Humanoid level. And so much more.
[1:28:30.320 --> 1:28:34.560]  Winter Sun Plus is back in. I haven't cut the ads or put it back up, but you'll be able
[1:28:34.560 --> 1:28:39.720]  to start getting it tomorrow. It'll be 50% off as our new big sale. But the X2 is going
[1:28:39.720 --> 1:28:43.240]  to go off sale in a couple days. Brain Force Ultra is going to probably sell off today.

[1:28:54.240 --> 1:28:59.600]  Tomorrow's news today.
[1:28:59.600 --> 1:29:04.480]  Everything we've witnessed in the last few decades has only been the buildup for what
[1:29:04.480 --> 1:29:09.600]  the globalists are doing right now. This is their big offensive. This is their takeover.
[1:29:09.600 --> 1:29:13.600]  And this is the point that they're at their very weakest because now they've revealed themselves.
[1:29:13.600 --> 1:29:17.640]  Now their world government, their permanent martial law, their medical tyranny is out
[1:29:17.640 --> 1:29:22.680]  in the open. Their depopulation agenda has been exposed. But they're using their corporate
[1:29:22.680 --> 1:29:27.400]  power and trillions to go across the planet and shut down people telling the truth. So
[1:29:27.400 --> 1:29:30.840]  listen, Paul Revere's, when you spread the word about the broadcast, when you pray for
[1:29:30.840 --> 1:29:35.360]  the broadcast, you're the tip of the spear. And when you buy products at infowarstore.com,

[1:31:04.640 --> 1:31:10.040]  you don't have anything to hide, criminals, hackers, corporations, big tech government
[1:31:10.040 --> 1:31:15.200]  are stealing all of your data and creating a map and a database of where you go and what
[1:31:15.200 --> 1:31:21.200]  you do. So in the future, under their globalist takeover, they can shut you down. Protecting
[1:31:21.200 --> 1:31:25.120]  your privacy, protecting your credit cards, protecting your bank accounts, protecting

[1:31:53.560 --> 1:31:54.560]  amazing.
[1:31:54.560 --> 1:32:03.800]  If you're ruthless mega corporations who've taken over almost every government on earth
[1:32:03.800 --> 1:32:09.000]  and who are trying to destroy the middle class in any form of operability, you've got to
[1:32:09.000 --> 1:32:13.240]  divide and conquer the public so they don't know they're being targeted. That's why the
[1:32:13.240 --> 1:32:19.040]  Fortune 100 have wrapped themselves, the name of LBGT and African American rights, all the
[1:32:19.040 --> 1:32:23.120]  rest of it, all over the world. That's now their corporate face while they run slave
[1:32:23.120 --> 1:32:27.800]  camps in Africa and in communist China and many other areas, while they undermine our
[1:32:27.800 --> 1:32:32.520]  basic liberties here and spy on us through the big tech, the central banks and other
[1:32:32.520 --> 1:32:33.520]  zone.
[1:32:33.520 --> 1:32:39.720]  So this is a criminal takeover. And when you look at the new superclass, it's the politicians,
[1:32:39.720 --> 1:32:44.360]  it's the corporate media, it's the police, it's the bureaucrats, it's members of Congress
[1:32:44.360 --> 1:32:48.640]  and their staff and their families, it's the White House, hell it's postal workers who
[1:32:48.640 --> 1:32:54.400]  were all exempt from the poison shots, but not the general public and everybody else
[1:32:54.400 --> 1:33:00.080]  through corporate rule. So this is the true discrimination that's going on.
[1:33:00.080 --> 1:33:15.960]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:15.960 --> 1:33:22.040]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:22.040 --> 1:33:33.840]  You keep saying you've got something for me, something you call love, but confess. You've
[1:33:33.840 --> 1:33:38.400]  been a messin' where you shouldn't have been a messin'.
[1:33:38.400 --> 1:33:44.240]  You know, I went through the stacks they gave me, they printed off probably from exaggerate.
[1:33:44.240 --> 1:33:51.600]  200 articles. And I found four articles in the stacks, not even searching for it, of
[1:33:51.600 --> 1:33:56.440]  psychologists, psychiatrists, medical doctors, you name it, mainly medical doctors being
[1:33:56.440 --> 1:34:04.880]  grabbed in Canada alone and put in mental institutions because they exposed massive
[1:34:04.880 --> 1:34:11.960]  increases in stillbirths, massive increases in heart attacks, which are true. And then
[1:34:11.960 --> 1:34:16.760]  how my brain works is I'm reading this and I get mad and I start thinking about all the
[1:34:16.760 --> 1:34:22.640]  ones I didn't cover yesterday and the day before and I start thinking about, I've seen
[1:34:22.640 --> 1:34:26.440]  at least 20 different cases of this and you know you only hear about one out of a hundred
[1:34:26.440 --> 1:34:33.440]  or so in Australia, in Europe, in Germany. And then I remember doctors, they come and
[1:34:33.440 --> 1:34:38.120]  grab, remember the doctor that was doing a live stream on Facebook, a medical doctor,
[1:34:38.120 --> 1:34:42.240]  very prestigious about how the vaccine was killing people and then the cops came and
[1:34:42.240 --> 1:34:50.080]  grabbed him, he's dead. He was just found dead thrown on the street. See, there's only
[1:34:50.080 --> 1:34:55.760]  one level now to go up on the stove. We're up at like a nine, it goes to ten. Level ten
[1:34:55.760 --> 1:34:59.840]  is grabbing everybody and killing us. They're already building the camps, they're in the
[1:34:59.840 --> 1:35:03.400]  camps. I mean, Jokovic, they say, yeah, come to Australia, you got natural immunity, we'll
[1:35:03.400 --> 1:35:09.920]  show you. Oh, the National Medical Board gave you a pass? Well, our Homeland Security doesn't,
[1:35:09.920 --> 1:35:14.040]  you're locked for a week and a half in a flea hotel in a cage. Oh, you can come out now.
[1:35:14.040 --> 1:35:19.920]  Oh, sorry, got to leave now. And now all these governments are banning him to show him. Well,
[1:35:19.920 --> 1:35:29.480]  how about all of the stars band together and say, we're taking a one-year hiatus? Oh, they'll
[1:35:29.480 --> 1:35:34.200]  get together sometimes in football or baseball and have a strike over money. How about your
[1:35:34.200 --> 1:35:38.840]  freedom? How about your health? How about a strike in the NFL? How about a strike in the
[1:35:38.840 --> 1:35:42.680]  big international soccer divisions where you've had hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of
[1:35:42.680 --> 1:35:49.320]  people have heart attacks more than a hundred die? Don't you know how to band together? It's
[1:35:49.320 --> 1:35:54.200]  instead, it's like, oh, Jokovic is a loser. More countries are banning him. Nanny, nanny, boo, boo.
[1:35:54.200 --> 1:36:10.760]  Jokovic is smart. The NFL players are smart. Aaron Rodgers. Tom Brady's smart. Tom Brady
[1:36:10.760 --> 1:36:17.200]  didn't wear a mask last year this year. He knows it's a BS and he knows to stand up. And so they
[1:36:17.200 --> 1:36:23.480]  should use their celebrity for good. And that makes you that actually admire them. My wife's a
[1:36:23.480 --> 1:36:27.400]  big tennis fan. She loves Jokovic. She loves it all. Always, I don't even know who he is,
[1:36:27.400 --> 1:36:32.840]  because I don't have time to watch sports. But now I actually want to know about Novak Jokovic.
[1:36:32.840 --> 1:36:38.840]  Now I admire him. Now I'm going to watch him. But see, you're not allowed to because he is his
[1:36:38.840 --> 1:36:48.360]  own person. He isn't a good little slave. He has to pay. He has to be punished. And when you submit
[1:36:48.360 --> 1:36:52.600]  and take the second, third, fourth, fifth shot, the UN came out and said, actually, the shots are
[1:36:52.600 --> 1:36:57.640]  unlimited. We got to give you shots now every couple months forever. We have to tweak them and
[1:36:57.640 --> 1:37:01.880]  put new things in you. Oh, it's not just an experimental thing with no background. Now it's
[1:37:01.880 --> 1:37:10.760]  just whatever the new thing is, of course. That's why three months ago, the FDA sort of the European
[1:37:10.760 --> 1:37:18.840]  Union Agency said, you know, unlimited nanotech, any type you like in the food, anything, plastic,
[1:37:18.840 --> 1:37:23.560]  metals, biological, just anything we want, we're going to spray it on your food.
[1:37:28.520 --> 1:37:32.200]  And then you have all the studies on what the nanotech does destroying you. They're killing us.
[1:37:33.560 --> 1:37:38.120]  They took all the texting balances off, all the protections off, and they're coming after us.
[1:37:39.720 --> 1:37:43.720]  And so this is the fight. Everybody's got to decide. But meanwhile, what is Biden doing?
[1:37:43.720 --> 1:37:53.240]  Biden Harris 2024, we don't have bad leaders. We have bad followers. That's actually not a joke.
[1:37:54.680 --> 1:37:59.480]  You're like, it doesn't make sense. Well, one guy was on a plane taking sips of his drink in
[1:37:59.480 --> 1:38:03.080]  between. And so they threw him off. He said, this doesn't make sense. Mass don't work anyways.
[1:38:03.080 --> 1:38:08.120]  And the flight attendant said, the stewardess said, it doesn't need to make sense. I have
[1:38:08.120 --> 1:38:14.760]  that club today. See, she gets it. They torture Winston. Joe, and he says Winston, how many fingers
[1:38:14.760 --> 1:38:18.920]  am I holding up? And he goes, I don't know how many. And O'Brien's holding up 40. He goes,
[1:38:18.920 --> 1:38:23.560]  exactly how many goes, whatever you tell me. And O'Brien says 10. And he sees 10. He says,
[1:38:23.560 --> 1:38:29.320]  he sees two, he sees two. Whatever O'Brien says, the fingers just blur and become what he wants.
[1:38:29.320 --> 1:38:40.600]  And that's where they want to get you where you can't even think. Like, hey, if the vaccine doesn't
[1:38:40.600 --> 1:38:45.320]  work, why am I supposed to take more? Or like, if it worked, why are the unvaccinated in dangering
[1:38:45.320 --> 1:38:56.360]  me? And this is classic Manchurian candidate, shy, calm torture techniques or Stalinistic
[1:38:56.360 --> 1:39:00.680]  torture techniques. I mean, this is Stalin era stuff, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:39:03.640 --> 1:39:08.840]  Oh, and look, hygiene, they've already introduced officially this week, we'll show it next segment.
[1:39:09.400 --> 1:39:14.120]  In Australia, the social credit score tied to your vaccine. And it's got driver's license,
[1:39:14.120 --> 1:39:20.280]  birth certificate, Australian visa, Australian passport. And hygiene, your strength is basic.
[1:39:20.280 --> 1:39:23.240]  But as she gives the right groups and has her son castrated,
[1:39:23.240 --> 1:39:29.640]  as she joins the Church of Satan, I'm not joking, she's going to be full power, and she's going to
[1:39:29.640 --> 1:39:33.800]  get everything cheaper and better. But the people that don't have it, they're not allowed to leave
[1:39:33.800 --> 1:39:38.440]  their house. And then once their house gets repossessed, they're going to a work camp. Now,
[1:39:38.440 --> 1:39:42.520]  Australians have said, you won't, I can't really do a good Australian accent, which is like,
[1:39:42.520 --> 1:39:47.160]  you will not be able to, that's more of a British accent, you will not be able to just sit around
[1:39:47.160 --> 1:39:52.440]  though, you're going to a camp, you're going to work. And the media is like, that's, they're lucky
[1:39:52.440 --> 1:39:58.680]  to go to a camp and have to work. I say we kill them. We're suddenly in total 1984.
[1:40:00.040 --> 1:40:05.080]  But there are pockets around the world, like Florida, areas of Texas, South Dakota, where
[1:40:05.080 --> 1:40:08.440]  people are still sane, and the system knows we won't put up with it, because enough of us just
[1:40:08.440 --> 1:40:12.040]  say screw it, I'm not doing it. But oh, you can't get on a plane now. Oh, can't get a train. Oh,
[1:40:12.040 --> 1:40:15.880]  your child can't go to school. Oh, you don't get the, as they put in that global social credit
[1:40:15.880 --> 1:40:22.040]  score, my gov ID. Canada's rolling theirs out too. And they say they're going to find you if you
[1:40:22.040 --> 1:40:25.880]  don't accept it and take it. So if you don't take a cell phone track and everything you do,
[1:40:25.880 --> 1:40:31.480]  that the EU, the French government, they're all announcing, it's all official. It's here,
[1:40:31.480 --> 1:40:35.880]  it ain't coming no more. It's not old Alex Jones telling you it's coming. It's here now.
[1:40:37.880 --> 1:40:44.440]  I hear the train are coming. It's rolling around the bend. And I ain't seen the sunshine since
[1:40:44.440 --> 1:40:52.360]  I don't know when I'm stuck in Folsom prison and time keeps dragging on. And the robots are rolling
[1:40:52.360 --> 1:40:58.280]  down the streets all over the world. Literally in Singapore going, I am here to see your papers
[1:40:59.720 --> 1:41:06.680]  exhibit your vaccine passport for scan now. And then unscanned, unscanned of siren literally
[1:41:06.680 --> 1:41:11.560]  pops up on the top of the robot and police come. You do not have your vaccine passport.
[1:41:11.560 --> 1:41:18.200]  Stand by for arrest. And it's the Daleks from Doctor Who. Remember, exterminate,
[1:41:19.000 --> 1:41:26.520]  exterminate, exterminate, exterminate. The science fiction folks even predict it,
[1:41:26.520 --> 1:41:31.480]  but it's got an American flag on it. And the scientists are doing it. And the law enforcement
[1:41:31.480 --> 1:41:39.240]  professionals are going to save us with the robots. Man, it's soy boy time, baby.
[1:41:39.240 --> 1:41:44.920]  And they show you the robot with the beauty of a human eye and say psychological warfare,
[1:41:44.920 --> 1:41:54.280]  look human faces, robot. Oh, yeah. Isn't it nice? And it's not that these robots in and of themselves
[1:41:54.280 --> 1:42:00.600]  are a bad thing. It's that the globalists will then control all of this. And whoever did that
[1:42:00.600 --> 1:42:05.720]  ad, if you're a radio listener, you can't see it, but I put a TV ad up for police robots. And it
[1:42:05.720 --> 1:42:10.840]  starts like the space shuttle and American flags and robots and American flags on them. It's like,
[1:42:10.840 --> 1:42:16.600]  it's American. I'm taking it. I want one of them robots. But anytime the globalist want,
[1:42:17.240 --> 1:42:23.800]  they can just cut in and take over the little robot. And now you're living in a real maximum
[1:42:23.800 --> 1:42:31.240]  overdrive. And soy boy right in the middle. Oh, it's soy time. It's robot time.
[1:42:31.240 --> 1:42:39.080]  And I always say it won't be long now. Well, you can put a knife in it, folks. You can put a fork
[1:42:39.080 --> 1:42:45.960]  in it. I'd say about January 18, 2022. The new world order ain't arriving. It's here.
[1:42:46.600 --> 1:42:52.680]  And it just hit us like a Mack truck. Get ready. Phase two is mass extermination. Stay with us.
[1:42:52.680 --> 1:43:03.160]  Let's go ahead and take another call. Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee. Welcome. Hello, Alex.
[1:43:03.160 --> 1:43:06.680]  Yes, Malcolm. All right, I will make this quick and real short where the other
[1:43:06.680 --> 1:43:11.720]  Patriots can get on the line. Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts,
[1:43:11.720 --> 1:43:18.040]  Owen Schreuer, Supermail Vitality and Brainforce Plus. Mix those two together. You're an unstoppable
[1:43:18.040 --> 1:43:23.480]  type. Supermail Vitality really, really works. It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds
[1:43:23.480 --> 1:43:29.640]  that have never been heated up. And so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions.
[1:43:29.640 --> 1:43:34.840]  They also work quite well, but just aren't as strong. This is like a very fine wine. In fact,
[1:43:34.840 --> 1:43:38.680]  each batch is different. Sometimes it's super strong. Sometimes it's just okay. People are like,
[1:43:38.680 --> 1:43:41.960]  why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't strong? That's just
[1:43:41.960 --> 1:43:48.120]  how it is. It's how it works. So it's always good. It's just sometimes it's like super strong. But
[1:43:48.120 --> 1:43:51.880]  yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[1:44:00.040 --> 1:44:04.680]  What are champions made of? Here's a man who can show you.
[1:44:04.680 --> 1:44:09.720]  What are you?
[1:44:11.160 --> 1:44:13.460]  Triple eight to five three, three, one, three, nine.
[1:44:43.460 --> 1:45:03.860]  I want to explain something that is absolutely feed understanding our world.
[1:45:03.860 --> 1:45:06.980]  It's very very simple, but the most we'll don't know.
[1:45:06.980 --> 1:45:13.740]  The privately owned central banks of the world are artificially creating thousands of trillions
[1:45:13.740 --> 1:45:20.300]  of dollars in other major currencies and using them to buy up infrastructure, intellectual
[1:45:20.300 --> 1:45:26.980]  property, energy, they're using it to buy people, to buy influence and in the past they
[1:45:26.980 --> 1:45:31.660]  created thousands of trillions so that they could leverage that manipulated market so
[1:45:31.660 --> 1:45:35.740]  they never allowed that money to get into the general circulation or it would cause
[1:45:35.740 --> 1:45:36.740]  massive inflation.
[1:45:36.740 --> 1:45:41.820]  Now they've gone ahead and weaponized it and are flooding every sector of the world economy
[1:45:41.820 --> 1:45:47.820]  buying up everything not to have the companies operate but to actually shut them down and
[1:45:47.820 --> 1:45:52.340]  force the collapse of civilization making the companies they do fund the only things
[1:45:52.340 --> 1:45:53.340]  left standing.
[1:45:53.340 --> 1:45:57.340]  This is the great reset, this is what's happening now, war on everyone is the only way to stop
[1:45:57.340 --> 1:45:58.340]  it.
[1:45:58.340 --> 1:46:02.020]  This is a great sponsor.
[1:46:02.020 --> 1:46:06.260]  We have one of the best deals you're going to find out there on a high-quality, high-rated
[1:46:06.260 --> 1:46:07.260]  satellite phone.
[1:46:07.260 --> 1:46:11.300]  If you can't be tracked, you can't be traced and it will work anywhere in the world where
[1:46:11.300 --> 1:46:12.300]  you can see the sky.
[1:46:12.300 --> 1:46:15.900]  You can also buy cheap antennas and things for your car in your house that also are on
[1:46:15.900 --> 1:46:16.900]  the site.
[1:46:16.900 --> 1:46:19.860]  M4WarsPhone.com, that's just a site that takes you to these folks.
[1:46:19.860 --> 1:46:23.540]  They supply the board for all everybody but their systems as well, they're amazing folks

[1:46:30.980 --> 1:46:34.340]  Smartphones are always tracking everything you do, these aren't and the calls are free
[1:46:34.340 --> 1:46:40.620]  when folks call you, you just pay $99.95 a month for your minutes, $150 minutes, so the
[1:46:40.620 --> 1:46:43.860]  calls you are free or take a regular cell phone, you're not being tracked or traced
[1:46:43.860 --> 1:46:47.580]  and I keep one of my car, I've given it to my parents as gifts, way out the middle of
[1:46:47.580 --> 1:46:54.700]  nowhere where regular phones don't work, they work, M4WarsPhone.com or 941-955-1029-4195-1020
[1:46:54.700 --> 1:47:00.380]  and ask the Alex Jones Special.
[1:47:00.380 --> 1:47:08.220]  Speaking of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:08.220 --> 1:47:35.420]  In a moment we're going to play clips in Canada and in Germany where they're telling
[1:47:35.420 --> 1:47:40.980]  you you're going to be taxed, you're going to be punished if you don't have your vaccine
[1:47:40.980 --> 1:47:41.980]  passed.
[1:47:41.980 --> 1:47:46.780]  The first clip I'm going to play when we get to that is the Australian Government Minister
[1:47:46.780 --> 1:47:57.140]  admitting that they accessed 80 plus percent of the public's phones and in Germany they
[1:47:57.140 --> 1:48:01.260]  admit that they're using it to arrest people.
[1:48:01.260 --> 1:48:05.700]  So if a crime is committed they can check all the phones around and then go question
[1:48:05.700 --> 1:48:08.380]  all those people and again you say well that's good, it'll stop criminals, they're not trying
[1:48:08.380 --> 1:48:09.380]  to do that.
[1:48:09.380 --> 1:48:12.420]  They send the President for total control and say you can't leave your house if you don't
[1:48:12.420 --> 1:48:16.500]  put in your body what they want to put in there.
[1:48:16.500 --> 1:48:23.180]  That's clip 10, that's Quebec announces significant tax for unvaccinated and we get clips out
[1:48:23.180 --> 1:48:27.580]  of Germany where they're going to the next level and arresting people who are again or
[1:48:27.580 --> 1:48:32.580]  outside with our phones, same thing Australia, same thing now coming to the US and then it's
[1:48:32.580 --> 1:48:37.220]  publicly announced they're going to put people in camps that haven't taken the vaccine under
[1:48:37.220 --> 1:48:42.300]  emergency orders by Democrat governors in New York and Washington state and Brian Stelter
[1:48:42.300 --> 1:48:46.580]  says it doesn't exist because it's his job to deny they're doing it till it's already
[1:48:46.580 --> 1:48:51.300]  in place and then they overrun you and grab you and your family.
[1:48:51.300 --> 1:48:56.020]  The Holy Grail is being able to take you away without due process and that's where we are.
[1:48:56.020 --> 1:48:59.820]  That's the Holy Grail of these criminals but here's Democrat strategist Paul Begala so
[1:48:59.820 --> 1:49:05.460]  when you know it's coming out of his mouth that's from the Clintons, that's from Obama
[1:49:05.460 --> 1:49:16.980]  saying that it is the fault of Biden's constituents that his agenda is failing, here it is.
[1:49:16.980 --> 1:49:21.700]  Did President Biden put more effort into getting infrastructure passed for example?
[1:49:21.700 --> 1:49:27.220]  Well he got infrastructure passed and that's a good thing because success can breed success.
[1:49:27.220 --> 1:49:29.300]  He is putting the full force to the presidency behind it.
[1:49:29.300 --> 1:49:33.580]  I think the problem for the Democrats right now is it's not that they have bad leaders,
[1:49:33.580 --> 1:49:36.100]  they're bad followers.
[1:49:36.100 --> 1:49:40.700]  And then we have the full clip on infowars.com where he goes on and explains that his followers
[1:49:40.700 --> 1:49:41.700]  aren't smart.
[1:49:41.700 --> 1:49:43.500]  They don't know they're getting a great thing.
[1:49:43.500 --> 1:49:48.660]  The doubling of gas prices, the massive inflation, the borders wide open, the garbage and homeless
[1:49:48.660 --> 1:49:58.780]  everywhere, the fentanyl, the overdosing, they just don't know how good they've got it.
[1:49:58.780 --> 1:50:07.060]  And in Canada they are announcing a significant tax for the unvaccinated, then we'll play
[1:50:07.060 --> 1:50:12.620]  the clip of people actually fighting back, truckers are blocking highways, but again
[1:50:12.620 --> 1:50:17.220]  that just at the end of the day, it's good resistance but the globalists want things
[1:50:17.220 --> 1:50:18.220]  to break down.
[1:50:18.220 --> 1:50:20.700]  They know you're going to fight back and it's going to break down, that's the next phase
[1:50:20.700 --> 1:50:21.700]  of this.
[1:50:21.700 --> 1:50:25.740]  But I'm not saying you don't submit, you just understand that that's part of the larger
[1:50:25.740 --> 1:50:27.860]  plan as well and expose their plan.
[1:50:27.860 --> 1:50:30.780]  You'll just fight pieces or heads of the hydra.
[1:50:30.780 --> 1:50:33.260]  You've got to politically get to the root of it.
[1:50:33.260 --> 1:50:36.060]  Here it is.
[1:50:36.060 --> 1:50:43.220]  Announcing that we are currently working on a health contribution that will be charged
[1:50:43.220 --> 1:50:48.580]  to all adults in Quebec who refuse vaccination.
[1:50:48.580 --> 1:50:55.380]  Now obviously those who cannot get vaccinated for medical reasons will be excluded but we
[1:50:55.380 --> 1:50:57.860]  think this is where we're at now.
[1:50:57.860 --> 1:51:07.340]  So people who refuse vaccination cause a burden on the staff, a financial burden, a significant
[1:51:07.340 --> 1:51:21.700]  burden for the majority of Quebecers, so it's not true that this 10% of the population will
[1:51:21.700 --> 1:51:26.260]  come and hinder the 90% of the population.
[1:51:26.260 --> 1:51:29.100]  So we are looking at amounts.
[1:51:29.100 --> 1:51:39.220]  We want the amount to be significant and it's going to be a new health contribution that
[1:51:39.220 --> 1:51:44.380]  will be required and we're currently looking with the Minister of Finance how we're going
[1:51:44.380 --> 1:51:45.980]  to apply that.
[1:51:45.980 --> 1:51:51.340]  But all adults in Quebec who don't accept over the next few weeks to at least get their
[1:51:51.340 --> 1:51:59.080]  first dose, well they'll get a bill to pay because there are consequences on our health
[1:51:59.080 --> 1:52:04.420]  care system and it's not up to the whole of the Quebec population to pay for that.
[1:52:04.420 --> 1:52:07.500]  That's how they get you in the collectivist trap.
[1:52:07.500 --> 1:52:10.780]  That bear trap and slow motion closing on your leg.
[1:52:10.780 --> 1:52:14.260]  But meanwhile the people taking the shots are the most sick.
[1:52:14.260 --> 1:52:17.900]  Meanwhile the people submitting to all this are in the worst shape.
[1:52:17.900 --> 1:52:20.740]  And their answer is you're sick cause they didn't take it.
[1:52:20.740 --> 1:52:23.780]  The murder of logic, true idiocracy.
[1:52:23.780 --> 1:52:27.220]  So just take your first dose and then we'll let you leave your house and we won't find
[1:52:27.220 --> 1:52:28.220]  you.
[1:52:28.220 --> 1:52:33.740]  And then of course it turns out all the world from Australia to the U.S. governments keep
[1:52:33.740 --> 1:52:38.140]  a database of the unvax because I'll assure you when they finally force you to take it
[1:52:38.140 --> 1:52:40.700]  you're getting something really special.
[1:52:40.700 --> 1:52:43.020]  You're not going to get just the regular mutinogen.
[1:52:43.020 --> 1:52:47.140]  You're going to get a real death shot.
[1:52:47.140 --> 1:52:49.580]  And if you get in a civil war then they like that even better.
[1:52:49.580 --> 1:52:51.180]  They'll just kill the cops in military.
[1:52:51.180 --> 1:52:52.900]  They see them as dumb animals.
[1:52:52.900 --> 1:52:57.500]  So they've actually worried this whole thing out unless you have a full awakening to the
[1:52:57.500 --> 1:53:00.940]  whole deal you have no hope.
[1:53:00.940 --> 1:53:04.380]  The average person, the average man I know knows all about football, all about baseball.
[1:53:04.380 --> 1:53:08.140]  They know about the family histories of the players and all this crap doesn't matter.
[1:53:08.140 --> 1:53:10.780]  But you don't know about Klaus Schwab and the Carnegie Endowment.
[1:53:10.780 --> 1:53:12.260]  You don't know about the CIA.
[1:53:12.260 --> 1:53:13.580]  You don't know about the New World Order.
[1:53:13.580 --> 1:53:14.700]  You don't know about the Great Reset.
[1:53:14.700 --> 1:53:24.740]  You don't know about Operating Swankstep and you're going to die then.
[1:53:24.740 --> 1:53:28.580]  There's another clip of the health minister admitting the government and the press conference
[1:53:28.580 --> 1:53:33.740]  that they have spied on you 80 plus percent of the population of Canada.
[1:53:33.740 --> 1:53:36.620]  Again, they're letting you know we illegally spied on you.
[1:53:36.620 --> 1:53:40.260]  We did this all the phones almost two years ago.
[1:53:40.260 --> 1:53:49.300]  It was in February of two years ago, 23 months ago, that Bill Gates and all of them said,
[1:53:49.300 --> 1:53:55.420]  Abel's group said that you're going to take unlimited shots and they said that they were
[1:53:55.420 --> 1:53:59.620]  going to make you have these IDs and all these things to do this.
[1:53:59.620 --> 1:54:03.780]  They said that it was never going to end.
[1:54:03.780 --> 1:54:07.460]  They said that they were going to watch you in live time and Google and Apple announced
[1:54:07.460 --> 1:54:12.740]  that, oh, in a rare partnership with the same group, we're going to put a secret app on
[1:54:12.740 --> 1:54:17.300]  everybody's phone that we jointly run to track where you are at all times for your safety
[1:54:17.300 --> 1:54:18.300]  for COVID.
[1:54:18.300 --> 1:54:22.500]  And that is the travel pass to be able to live your life and go anywhere.
[1:54:22.500 --> 1:54:24.220]  And now Australia, oh, I forgot to get to it.
[1:54:24.220 --> 1:54:27.500]  We'll hit that at the start of the next hour, has rolled out their new official system.
[1:54:27.500 --> 1:54:32.940]  It's exactly what Klaus Schwab put out via GG Ping and China that has at the very top
[1:54:32.940 --> 1:54:37.620]  of it your social credit score.
[1:54:37.620 --> 1:54:41.500]  And it begins with your first shot with you've got basic, but when you get all the shots
[1:54:41.500 --> 1:54:45.940]  they want and you don't complain and you behave yourself and you do what they say, it goes
[1:54:45.940 --> 1:54:49.460]  up.
[1:54:49.460 --> 1:54:52.180]  And then like coupons, women love coupons.
[1:54:52.180 --> 1:54:59.580]  If you kill yourself very slowly, you get all sorts of goodies like free coffee and
[1:54:59.580 --> 1:55:02.820]  free hamburgers and you're allowed to go outside sometimes.
[1:55:02.820 --> 1:55:05.340]  It tells you when because it's part of the carbon thing.
[1:55:05.340 --> 1:55:06.700]  It's got a carbon section.
[1:55:06.700 --> 1:55:07.900]  Oh, I told you that'd be on there.
[1:55:07.900 --> 1:55:08.900]  It's now official.
[1:55:08.900 --> 1:55:09.900]  Yeah.
[1:55:09.900 --> 1:55:15.820]  Oh, look, you're being good.
[1:55:15.820 --> 1:55:17.180]  You're behaving.
[1:55:17.180 --> 1:55:19.980]  It's all there.
[1:55:19.980 --> 1:55:24.940]  The new global ID and look at that when you behave yourself.
[1:55:24.940 --> 1:55:28.340]  It goes up when you make good purchases that are good for the earth and good for you.
[1:55:28.340 --> 1:55:31.940]  It goes up and when you send your children for sterilization or brainwashing, it goes
[1:55:31.940 --> 1:55:32.940]  up.
[1:55:32.940 --> 1:55:33.940]  You go to drag queen story time.
[1:55:33.940 --> 1:55:37.620]  It goes up when you go to Satan hour, it goes up when you're for open borders to keep
[1:55:37.620 --> 1:55:38.620]  your mouth shut.
[1:55:38.620 --> 1:55:39.620]  It goes up.
[1:55:39.620 --> 1:55:40.620]  It's so liberal.
[1:55:40.620 --> 1:55:42.940]  It's so, so good.
[1:55:42.940 --> 1:55:45.380]  Oh my goodness.
[1:55:45.380 --> 1:55:47.100]  Look, it tells you all about it.
[1:55:47.100 --> 1:55:50.780]  It's all here.
[1:55:50.780 --> 1:55:51.780]  And where's the Santas?
[1:55:51.780 --> 1:55:52.780]  You're not really talking about it.
[1:55:52.780 --> 1:55:55.060]  He's fighting the agenda, but not addressing the root of it.
[1:55:55.060 --> 1:55:58.220]  Where's Rand Paul fighting the agenda some, but not the root of it.
[1:55:58.220 --> 1:56:01.420]  Where's Trump basically doing nothing to fight it?
[1:56:01.420 --> 1:56:04.660]  And they all know full damn well, but they know you go up against this.
[1:56:04.660 --> 1:56:05.660]  They come after you.
[1:56:05.660 --> 1:56:08.900]  They're coming after you anyways.
[1:56:08.900 --> 1:56:13.020]  Go ahead and go to part of the clip out of Canada with the spying on you.
[1:56:13.020 --> 1:56:17.660]  Public Health Agency of Canada confirmed media reports just before Christmas that it had
[1:56:17.660 --> 1:56:24.300]  secretly accessed location data for 33 million mobile devices to monitor the movement of
[1:56:24.300 --> 1:56:28.900]  Canadians during COVID-19.
[1:56:28.900 --> 1:56:34.820]  That number represents roughly 87% of the population who are spied on without any knowledge
[1:56:34.820 --> 1:56:37.900]  that the government was accessing their data.
[1:56:37.900 --> 1:56:42.020]  No one knew that P hack was collecting their data and for what purpose.
[1:56:42.020 --> 1:56:44.380]  So why was it done in secret?
[1:56:44.380 --> 1:56:45.980]  Who authorized it?
[1:56:45.980 --> 1:56:47.780]  And who was this shared with?
[1:56:47.780 --> 1:56:50.140]  So why was it done in secret?
[1:56:50.140 --> 1:56:51.740]  Who authorized it?
[1:56:51.740 --> 1:56:54.100]  And who was this shared with?
[1:56:54.100 --> 1:57:00.700]  Second, the request for proposal to continue this program appeared on December 17th, 2021,
[1:57:00.700 --> 1:57:06.500]  the day after Parliament adjourned for the holidays and is set to expire January 21st,
[1:57:06.500 --> 1:57:10.740]  2022, 10 days before Parliament is set to return.
[1:57:10.740 --> 1:57:12.260]  Conveniently leaving.
[1:57:12.260 --> 1:57:14.300]  Conveniently so they can bring it back.
[1:57:14.300 --> 1:57:17.980]  Yeah, so good on that minister exposing it.
[1:57:17.980 --> 1:57:19.620]  But again, this is nothing new with viruses.
[1:57:19.620 --> 1:57:23.740]  It's about control and a casual society and the Mark of the Beast system they call the
[1:57:23.740 --> 1:57:24.740]  social credit score.
[1:57:24.740 --> 1:57:26.940]  It ain't coming.
[1:57:26.940 --> 1:57:29.180]  It's here.
[1:57:29.180 --> 1:57:32.740]  And remember the very group that created the virus and released it are the ones covering
[1:57:32.740 --> 1:57:34.820]  up all of that right now as well.
[1:57:34.820 --> 1:57:38.020]  What crazy person would comply with any of this?
[1:57:38.020 --> 1:57:42.460]  It's up to us that aren't asleep to warn those that are asleep.
[1:57:42.460 --> 1:57:43.460]  Wake up.
[1:57:43.460 --> 1:57:45.100]  Hour number three straight ahead.
[1:57:45.100 --> 1:57:52.940]  Hey, employers, if you're like me, you've been a long time listener of this program.
[1:57:52.940 --> 1:57:55.500]  You fed up with everything going on in the world.
[1:57:55.500 --> 1:57:58.980]  Inside you, like me, a fire is burning.
[1:57:58.980 --> 1:58:00.140]  Something needs to change.
[1:58:00.140 --> 1:58:05.460]  And yet we feel helpless, almost like we're stuck inside a system that someone else created
[1:58:05.460 --> 1:58:06.460]  for us.
[1:58:06.460 --> 1:58:08.580]  It's time for us to break free from that system.
[1:58:08.580 --> 1:58:11.220]  Reset Wars is a game changer.
[1:58:11.220 --> 1:58:16.340]  You start to see yourself more as part of the solution instead of just as a victim.
[1:58:16.340 --> 1:58:21.700]  So much of the stuff we look at today is low vibration, low energy, and makes us depressed
[1:58:21.700 --> 1:58:24.460]  and therefore we manifest this negative reality out there.
[1:58:24.460 --> 1:58:29.460]  When they feel their lie, cheat, steal plan to enslave and rob the people, there is an
[1:58:29.460 --> 1:58:30.460]  awakening.
[1:58:30.460 --> 1:58:37.460]  This has helped me to navigate and to pinpoint and lock onto the deep-rooted psychological
[1:58:37.460 --> 1:58:39.620]  tactics that were being used against me.
[1:58:39.620 --> 1:58:41.180]  And now I'm not scared anymore.
[1:58:41.180 --> 1:58:43.380]  I have to say, I was blown away.
[1:58:43.380 --> 1:58:46.700]  I feel so much better every day listening to it.
[1:58:46.700 --> 1:58:49.540]  To Alex, thank you very much for putting the course together.
[1:58:49.540 --> 1:58:51.020]  You're absolutely right.
[1:58:51.020 --> 1:58:53.340]  We are reflections of God.
[1:58:53.340 --> 1:58:54.740]  We are emanations of that.
[1:58:54.740 --> 1:58:59.460]  And we can use that God energy to do really anything we want to do in this life.
[1:58:59.460 --> 1:59:03.900]  Romans chapter 12, Paul talks about how we're transformed by the renewing of our mind.
[1:59:03.900 --> 1:59:05.100]  And that's a process.
[1:59:05.100 --> 1:59:08.180]  Most of our thoughts and actions are subconscious.
[1:59:08.180 --> 1:59:10.540]  Most people go through their day and don't think about many things.
[1:59:10.540 --> 1:59:14.180]  You can drive along a long journey and not even remember half the trip.
[1:59:14.180 --> 1:59:19.900]  In this process, we need to have a concerted, active effort physically and mentally to reprogram
[1:59:19.900 --> 1:59:21.620]  that subconscious mind.
[1:59:21.620 --> 1:59:26.140]  That's what this series is about, is resetting our mind because there's a war on for our
[1:59:26.140 --> 1:59:27.140]  mind.
[1:59:27.140 --> 1:59:28.140]  He's exactly right.
[1:59:28.140 --> 1:59:33.220]  He's become a great voice in our generation and in this new great awakening and I encourage
[1:59:33.220 --> 1:59:34.220]  everybody out there.
[1:59:34.220 --> 1:59:37.500]  If you haven't gone there yet, go to resetwars.com.
[1:59:37.500 --> 2:00:01.500]  That's where your journey begins.
[2:00:01.500 --> 2:00:14.180]  All right, Ollie Alexander with Huge News is set to join us.
[2:00:14.180 --> 2:00:17.780]  Joe Rogan interviewed General McMaster and asked him about January 6th.
[2:00:17.780 --> 2:00:23.100]  He had something very characteristically ridiculous and mindless to say.
[2:00:23.100 --> 2:00:25.500]  That's coming up next segment as well.
[2:00:25.500 --> 2:00:27.820]  Why January 6th so important?
[2:00:27.820 --> 2:00:33.340]  Because the power structure is betting the farm on running against Republicans and populists
[2:00:33.340 --> 2:00:39.140]  and anti-vaxxers and anti-lockdown, anti-market-the-beast people on this so you can bet they're preparing
[2:00:39.140 --> 2:00:40.140]  a false flag.
[2:00:40.140 --> 2:00:42.180]  And now we're admitting false flags are a real thing.
[2:00:42.180 --> 2:00:45.900]  They're going to have a real problem trying to poo poo that.
[2:00:45.900 --> 2:00:56.900]  But here is the report on the food supply illegally having nanotech added to it.
[2:00:56.900 --> 2:01:03.420]  The FDA has allowed nanoparticles into the food supply under the generally recognized
[2:01:03.420 --> 2:01:07.780]  as safe provision because they claim that they are no more dangerous than their larger
[2:01:07.780 --> 2:01:09.660]  counterparts.
[2:01:09.660 --> 2:01:14.100]  Titanium is generally safe, therefore nanotitanium must be safe.
[2:01:14.100 --> 2:01:19.660]  But they also admit that known materials can exhibit new or altered physiochemical properties
[2:01:19.660 --> 2:01:25.540]  at nanoscale dimensions, including unknown safety hazards that they will continue to monitor
[2:01:25.540 --> 2:01:27.040]  for.
[2:01:27.040 --> 2:01:32.660]  In other words, the human trials for consumable nanotechnology is currently happening in the
[2:01:32.660 --> 2:01:35.700]  public without their knowledge.
[2:01:35.700 --> 2:01:40.580]  Nanoparticles can be absorbed into our immune defense system and into our bloodstream.
[2:01:40.580 --> 2:01:46.060]  And just like the FDA admits, materials at the nanoscale can cause unknown changes in
[2:01:46.060 --> 2:01:48.740]  a person's biological system.
[2:01:48.740 --> 2:01:52.940]  Animal studies have proven that nanoparticles are changing the way our bodies absorb certain
[2:01:52.940 --> 2:01:55.660]  minerals such as iron.
[2:01:55.660 --> 2:02:01.540]  FDA chemist Timothy Duncan wrote that nanotechnology in the food supply is being held back because
[2:02:01.540 --> 2:02:07.380]  the food supply industry is afraid of public backlash and argues that nanotechnology will
[2:02:07.380 --> 2:02:10.380]  somehow make food healthier.
[2:02:10.380 --> 2:02:15.340]  The FDA is far more concerned with pushing more of these experimental nanoparticles into
[2:02:15.340 --> 2:02:18.540]  the food supply than they are with safety.
[2:02:18.540 --> 2:02:23.220]  Like they said about giving the dangerous experimental vaccines to your kids, we're never
[2:02:23.220 --> 2:02:28.140]  going to learn about how safe the vaccine is until we start giving it.
[2:02:28.140 --> 2:02:33.220]  At least 20 products are adding laboratory-made nanoparticles into the ingredients, and they
[2:02:33.220 --> 2:02:36.580]  are getting ready to coat bananas in new nanotech.
[2:02:36.580 --> 2:02:41.420]  But companies are not required to disclose nanosized ingredients, so we don't know how
[2:02:41.420 --> 2:02:44.300]  prevalent it is.
[2:02:44.300 --> 2:02:49.820]  Along with being a proponent of population reduction, forced vaccinations, and genetically
[2:02:49.820 --> 2:02:55.500]  modified foods, Bill Gates is also the biggest private farm owner in America.
[2:02:55.500 --> 2:03:00.980]  Does anyone doubt for a second that Bill Gates is allowing this dangerous nanotech the FDA
[2:03:00.980 --> 2:03:05.020]  is pushing for into America's food supply?
[2:03:05.020 --> 2:03:10.700]  In related news, 10 out of the 19 states in which Bill Gates owns farmland, along with
[2:03:10.700 --> 2:03:15.940]  at least another 10, have recently made it legal to dispose of human bodies into the
[2:03:15.940 --> 2:03:23.100]  municipal water supply, allowing human remains to be added into bio-solid-sourced fertilizer.
[2:03:23.100 --> 2:03:30.300]  It's called alkaline hydrolysis, and is referred to in pop culture as being very, very green.
[2:03:30.300 --> 2:03:34.900]  Spiritual leaders have strongly objected to alkaline hydrolysis because they say it is
[2:03:34.900 --> 2:03:39.740]  disrespectful to the human body, the vessel of a divine soul.
[2:03:39.740 --> 2:03:42.140]  And it's understandable why they say this.
[2:03:42.140 --> 2:03:48.340]  In alkaline hydrolysis, the human body is liquefied with lye, and poured down the sewer to mix
[2:03:48.340 --> 2:03:51.220]  in with the community's excrement.
[2:03:51.220 --> 2:03:56.860]  And if that weren't bad enough, this bio-sludge is then collected from municipal water treatment
[2:03:56.860 --> 2:04:01.980]  plants and used as so-called fertilizer on factory farms.
[2:04:01.980 --> 2:04:07.460]  The official excuse is that it saves the government money for expensive toxic waste disposal.
[2:04:07.460 --> 2:04:13.220]  Meanwhile, we are all being sold food that has been grown with a toxic bio-sludge made
[2:04:13.220 --> 2:04:20.020]  up of human remains and excrement, which is then loaded with new and strange nanotechnology.
[2:04:20.020 --> 2:04:25.700]  Interestingly, the dystopian movie Soylent Green took place in 2022.
[2:04:25.700 --> 2:04:28.700]  They're making our food out of people.
[2:04:28.700 --> 2:04:32.700]  The next thing they'll be breeding is like cattle for food.
[2:04:32.700 --> 2:04:34.700]  You gotta tell them.
[2:04:34.700 --> 2:04:36.700]  You gotta tell them.
[2:04:36.700 --> 2:04:37.700]  I promise.
[2:04:37.700 --> 2:04:38.700]  I'll tell the exchange.
[2:04:38.700 --> 2:04:39.700]  You tell everybody.
[2:04:39.700 --> 2:04:40.700]  Listen to me, Hatcher.
[2:04:40.700 --> 2:04:41.700]  You gotta tell them.
[2:04:41.700 --> 2:04:46.700]  Soylent Green is people.
[2:04:46.700 --> 2:04:49.700]  Reporting for Infowars, this is Greg Rees.
[2:04:49.700 --> 2:04:52.700]  You gotta tell them the World ID has now officially been rolled out.
[2:04:52.700 --> 2:04:58.700]  Why aren't Republicans opposing it?
[2:04:58.700 --> 2:05:04.900]  Christmas 2021 is over, but you still got a really great chance to give yourself the gift
[2:05:04.900 --> 2:05:09.260]  of free speech and liberty and freedom into the new year, all at the same time, making
[2:05:09.260 --> 2:05:13.980]  yourself healthier, wealthier, and wiser by boosting your immune system.
[2:05:13.980 --> 2:05:18.860]  Two of our top selling products that have been sold out for a long time are now back
[2:05:18.860 --> 2:05:19.860]  in stock.
[2:05:19.860 --> 2:05:24.860]  Winter Sun, the highest quality, vitamin D3, take it under the tongue for higher absorption
[2:05:24.860 --> 2:05:26.500]  is back in stock.
[2:05:26.500 --> 2:05:29.940]  Despite the fact it's been sold out for months, it is 50% off.
[2:05:29.940 --> 2:05:35.420]  And then our number one best seller of all time, Survival Shield X2 Deeper Crystal Iodine,
[2:05:35.420 --> 2:05:39.620]  the Game Changer, the Missing Link, not just for immune system, but all electrochemical
[2:05:39.620 --> 2:05:43.180]  activity in the body, it's back in stock, 50% off.
[2:05:43.180 --> 2:05:48.580]  So that's the new year special, and that's Christmas comes early in 2022, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:05:48.580 --> 2:05:54.380]  Give yourself the gift of health and clarity and focus with X2 and Winter Sun at infowarstore.com.
[2:05:54.380 --> 2:05:57.380]  50% off for a limited time.
[2:05:57.380 --> 2:06:21.660]  Thanks for keeping us on the air.
[2:06:21.660 --> 2:06:24.100]  Welcome to your life.
[2:06:24.100 --> 2:06:27.820]  There's no turning back.
[2:06:27.820 --> 2:06:37.740]  Well, Ali Alexander has for a long time been a very successful Republican analyst and journalist
[2:06:37.740 --> 2:06:42.900]  and monk raker, and he's also organized a lot of events across the country.
[2:06:42.900 --> 2:06:50.300]  And he was heavily involved, really spearheading peaceful demonstrations across the United
[2:06:50.300 --> 2:06:51.300]  States.
[2:06:51.300 --> 2:06:56.020]  There was, at many of them, going into capitals peacefully, not having one incident in Georgia
[2:06:56.020 --> 2:06:57.020]  of any other areas.
[2:06:57.020 --> 2:07:02.380]  We had a bunch of big rallies that we co-organized up in D.C. in the lead-up, and we wanted a
[2:07:02.380 --> 2:07:06.540]  10-day constitutional investigation of what happened on January 6th.
[2:07:06.540 --> 2:07:09.460]  And our listeners have called me, they've told me.
[2:07:09.460 --> 2:07:12.220]  They have said, Alex, we know you didn't attack the Capitol.
[2:07:12.220 --> 2:07:15.540]  We know it was mainly provocateur.
[2:07:15.540 --> 2:07:16.660]  There were some idiots, obviously.
[2:07:16.660 --> 2:07:19.500]  We've never denied that.
[2:07:19.500 --> 2:07:22.100]  People walking through velvet robes don't deserve to be in solitary confinement for
[2:07:22.100 --> 2:07:23.100]  a year.
[2:07:23.100 --> 2:07:24.820]  Come on.
[2:07:24.820 --> 2:07:30.500]  And so people ask me, why are you making such a big deal about it now?
[2:07:30.500 --> 2:07:39.420]  And it's because we have Biden Harris running on it and saying there's imminent terror attacks
[2:07:39.420 --> 2:07:43.980]  from the Tea Party and from Trump supporters and articles saying Rush Limbaugh and Alex
[2:07:43.980 --> 2:07:48.340]  Jones, they're saying this posthumously in this case, after he's dead, are going to be
[2:07:48.340 --> 2:07:50.260]  responsible for a civil war.
[2:07:50.260 --> 2:07:52.540]  No, no, no.
[2:07:52.540 --> 2:07:57.540]  The last thing I want is what they call a civil war, the American people having some
[2:07:57.540 --> 2:08:01.220]  type of battle with the military and the FBI.
[2:08:01.220 --> 2:08:03.540]  How does that beat Klaus Schwab, the New World Order?
[2:08:03.540 --> 2:08:09.060]  I'm not planning attacks, by the way, on Klaus Schwab or Bill Gates, but I'm in a war.
[2:08:09.060 --> 2:08:12.900]  I go up against who I'm actually fighting, and Gates has got a thousand evil people
[2:08:12.900 --> 2:08:13.900]  behind him.
[2:08:13.900 --> 2:08:14.900]  It's like shark teeth.
[2:08:14.900 --> 2:08:18.100]  You take out Bill Gates, more roll forward.
[2:08:18.100 --> 2:08:20.260]  We don't beat this with violence.
[2:08:20.260 --> 2:08:24.540]  So I don't just poo poo violence out of one side of my mouth like the left does after
[2:08:24.540 --> 2:08:25.540]  I call for it.
[2:08:25.540 --> 2:08:26.540]  That's what they do.
[2:08:26.540 --> 2:08:27.540]  Burn, kill, attack the police.
[2:08:27.540 --> 2:08:28.540]  I'm up for that.
[2:08:28.540 --> 2:08:32.420]  Give Black Lives Matter what it wants, or we're going to burn down New York.
[2:08:32.420 --> 2:08:36.420]  No, I don't believe in that.
[2:08:36.420 --> 2:08:40.900]  So the reason we're hammering this is, Ollie agrees with me, he's a smart political brain,
[2:08:40.900 --> 2:08:43.900]  one of the smartest out there, that this is what they're moving towards.
[2:08:43.900 --> 2:08:50.460]  So I want to talk about how do I make sure my broadcast is a place to really make sure
[2:08:50.460 --> 2:08:55.500]  that as many of our people as we can don't get sucked up in this, and are there any tricks
[2:08:55.500 --> 2:09:00.740]  that he can take over our ideas to just somehow derail where this is going, because Biden's
[2:09:00.740 --> 2:09:07.420]  approval rating is really below 30%, lowest in U.S. history for any president in modern
[2:09:07.420 --> 2:09:08.420]  times.
[2:09:08.420 --> 2:09:09.420]  Their whole agenda is falling apart.
[2:09:09.420 --> 2:09:13.980]  And Paul Begala's now, Democrats are now blaming their constituents, says we don't have bad
[2:09:13.980 --> 2:09:14.980]  leaders, we have bad followers.
[2:09:14.980 --> 2:09:17.940]  I mean, when you hear that, you're in North Korea.
[2:09:17.940 --> 2:09:23.300]  So this is very dystopian, and the answer is lower the temperature.
[2:09:23.300 --> 2:09:25.020]  Klaus Schwab wants to raise the temperature.
[2:09:25.020 --> 2:09:28.940]  Yes, I was raising the temperature, because Democrats were, if you see people out, attack
[2:09:28.940 --> 2:09:29.940]  them.
[2:09:29.940 --> 2:09:30.940]  Go out and burn things down.
[2:09:30.940 --> 2:09:31.940]  I'm like, no, we don't want that.
[2:09:31.940 --> 2:09:35.740]  Let's show everybody, though, that Biden can't get 100 people in a school gymnasium,
[2:09:35.740 --> 2:09:38.020]  but we can get a million, and we did get a million.
[2:09:38.020 --> 2:09:40.900]  That was about Martin Luther King, and we got hundreds of thousands that want racial
[2:09:40.900 --> 2:09:41.900]  peace.
[2:09:41.900 --> 2:09:45.460]  It wasn't about Martin Luther King wasn't an insurrectionist, neither were we, but
[2:09:45.460 --> 2:09:49.780]  our event was so big, there was negligence, there was a stand down by the feds bare minimum.
[2:09:49.780 --> 2:09:53.620]  They wouldn't let Trump have the National Guard, the FBI, HRT groups sat and watched
[2:09:53.620 --> 2:09:54.620]  it all happen.
[2:09:54.620 --> 2:09:55.620]  That's a fact now.
[2:09:55.620 --> 2:09:56.620]  I've got the articles right here.
[2:09:56.620 --> 2:10:01.420]  So deciphering all of this, we have to about where we go forward from here, what the Stuart
[2:10:01.420 --> 2:10:02.420]  Rhodes thing means.
[2:10:02.420 --> 2:10:07.940]  I mean, if that's a revolution, if that's an insurrection, they say in the indictment,
[2:10:07.940 --> 2:10:12.260]  push past police, ran around with zip ties looking for Pelosi.
[2:10:12.260 --> 2:10:15.940]  I mean, I'm sorry, the guys that did that, if they really did that, sound like Laurel
[2:10:15.940 --> 2:10:16.940]  and Hardy.
[2:10:16.940 --> 2:10:19.740]  If they think guys with zip ties are going to bring down the U.S. government.
[2:10:19.740 --> 2:10:23.580]  But nevertheless, doesn't sound good, okay, if it's true, they go to jail.
[2:10:23.580 --> 2:10:29.340]  But to act like that is all a master plan, and that my pillow guy and Donald Trump were
[2:10:29.340 --> 2:10:35.340]  giving orders through General Flynn to us, on my children is a 100% lie, and the opposite
[2:10:35.340 --> 2:10:40.300]  of what we wanted, a peaceful 10-day investigation that we'd never had at the court level would
[2:10:40.300 --> 2:10:41.300]  have happened.
[2:10:41.300 --> 2:10:43.300]  And we failed, and it blew up in our face.
[2:10:43.300 --> 2:10:48.500]  But I'll say this as Teddy Roosevelt said, at least we, Olly Alexander, myself and others
[2:10:48.500 --> 2:10:51.620]  and the million peaceful folks that showed up there are in the damn arena.
[2:10:51.620 --> 2:10:54.220]  Because you're never going to have a problem if you're not in the arena.
[2:10:54.220 --> 2:10:56.700]  But yes, we are in the arena.
[2:10:56.700 --> 2:10:58.020]  And so we need your prayers, your support.
[2:10:58.020 --> 2:10:59.020]  Olly, I've been ranting.
[2:10:59.020 --> 2:11:00.020]  That's good to have you here.
[2:11:00.020 --> 2:11:04.820]  You can go anywhere you want with this, but this is a crazy time to be alive right now.
[2:11:04.820 --> 2:11:07.980]  It is, Alex, and thanks for having me.
[2:11:07.980 --> 2:11:14.060]  I was recently in Arizona at the Trump rally, connecting with people that we touch.
[2:11:14.060 --> 2:11:20.460]  We touch many lives, especially in Arizona that's really ground zero for the election
[2:11:20.460 --> 2:11:21.460]  integrity movement.
[2:11:21.460 --> 2:11:25.460]  It should be Georgia, but Arizona is where they have the Cajones.
[2:11:25.460 --> 2:11:33.180]  And so we're fighting an internal Republican civil war, a political civil war, a civil
[2:11:33.180 --> 2:11:36.980]  war, and so it was really great to connect.
[2:11:36.980 --> 2:11:38.940]  But you're absolutely right, Alex.
[2:11:38.940 --> 2:11:45.060]  When we were on the trail, as I say, very frustrated veterans would occasionally walk
[2:11:45.060 --> 2:11:52.540]  up to me and they would say some comments in frustration that many would find inappropriate.
[2:11:52.540 --> 2:11:58.980]  But me being an empath, you being an empath, felt that their intention wasn't violence,
[2:11:58.980 --> 2:12:01.900]  but frustration, desperation.
[2:12:01.900 --> 2:12:08.860]  They didn't have the means to launch a rebellion or a revolution or the heart, the evil heart,
[2:12:08.860 --> 2:12:13.180]  the heart and heart to launch some type of lone wolf attack.
[2:12:13.180 --> 2:12:16.660]  But occasionally when we would hear these comments, one thing I would say is that we
[2:12:16.660 --> 2:12:20.060]  need to lean away from politics and towards faith.
[2:12:20.060 --> 2:12:25.620]  And I would say St. Thomas Aquinas reminds us that prudence is a virtue.
[2:12:25.620 --> 2:12:29.540]  So even if we have an illegitimate government, which I believe we have, and I'm not backing
[2:12:29.540 --> 2:12:30.700]  down from saying that.
[2:12:30.700 --> 2:12:32.500]  The government wants me to stop saying that.
[2:12:32.500 --> 2:12:33.500]  I'm going to keep it.
[2:12:33.500 --> 2:12:34.500]  No, no, amen.
[2:12:34.500 --> 2:12:35.500]  This thing, stay stolen.
[2:12:35.500 --> 2:12:36.500]  It's illegitimate.
[2:12:36.500 --> 2:12:37.500]  But in a way, it's hurting them.
[2:12:37.500 --> 2:12:39.000]  Everybody knows they stole it.
[2:12:39.000 --> 2:12:43.820]  That's why they want to have a violent system to turn the subject over to us.
[2:12:43.820 --> 2:12:47.780]  No, no, you just sit there and everybody hates you and the Democratic Party is extincting
[2:12:47.780 --> 2:12:48.780]  itself right now.
[2:12:48.780 --> 2:12:53.140]  If we can just stay patient, not be violent, let them punch us in the nose like Martin Luther
[2:12:53.140 --> 2:12:54.140]  King did.
[2:12:54.140 --> 2:12:56.660]  Junior, we're going to win.
[2:12:56.660 --> 2:12:58.060]  You're exactly right.
[2:12:58.060 --> 2:13:01.100]  And so what we always said is about our movement.
[2:13:01.100 --> 2:13:06.460]  It's our job to run the ball down the field, but the touchdown will ultimately be God's.
[2:13:06.460 --> 2:13:11.060]  And so what it means to be prudent is that even if there's a legitimate, there's legitimate
[2:13:11.060 --> 2:13:12.060]  tyranny out there.
[2:13:12.060 --> 2:13:17.300]  And I believe that there is, it would be imprudent to go out there and attack.
[2:13:17.300 --> 2:13:21.980]  So anybody who was cosplaying or larking or actually planning to attack the government
[2:13:21.980 --> 2:13:25.420]  was, I think, outside of God's will.
[2:13:25.420 --> 2:13:30.580]  And I said that week prior when people who weren't associated with our movement invaded
[2:13:30.580 --> 2:13:33.580]  the port of the Oregon State Capitol.
[2:13:33.580 --> 2:13:34.580]  You know, no true...
[2:13:34.580 --> 2:13:37.460]  And in Atlanta, people tried to get you to do it.
[2:13:37.460 --> 2:13:39.540]  And you said, no way, you're an idiot.
[2:13:39.540 --> 2:13:41.860]  And then the media tried to say, that was you saying not yet.
[2:13:41.860 --> 2:13:43.700]  I mean, they just spent everything.
[2:13:43.700 --> 2:13:44.700]  Yeah.
[2:13:44.700 --> 2:13:47.860]  So Alex, you know, I'm very proud of our prudent leadership.
[2:13:47.860 --> 2:13:51.300]  I'm not going to cave to the government and stop calling Biden illegitimate.
[2:13:51.300 --> 2:13:55.580]  And I'm not going to cave to the reactionaries who are otherwise good people who say, no,
[2:13:55.580 --> 2:13:56.580]  no, no.
[2:13:56.580 --> 2:13:57.580]  You and Alex need to lead this.
[2:13:57.580 --> 2:13:58.580]  You need to own this.
[2:13:58.580 --> 2:14:00.100]  No, we're going to do it the right way.
[2:14:00.100 --> 2:14:04.020]  And the Bible says that the path is narrow and it is narrow, my friend.
[2:14:04.020 --> 2:14:08.020]  So we must keep fighting for elections, keep fighting for our civil rights, fight for the
[2:14:08.020 --> 2:14:13.940]  due process of political prisoners, and denounce those who are outside of God's will, outside
[2:14:13.940 --> 2:14:15.340]  of prudent leadership.
[2:14:15.340 --> 2:14:19.540]  And I think that that's the only path forward, Alex, is the very narrow path.
[2:14:19.540 --> 2:14:25.540]  You and I are spending untold thousands of dollars in legal bills because we are men
[2:14:25.540 --> 2:14:26.780]  in the arena.
[2:14:26.780 --> 2:14:29.660]  And you know, thank God he chose us to be in it.
[2:14:29.660 --> 2:14:33.180]  Well, I mean, I'm just very thankful for listeners keeping us in the position we're
[2:14:33.180 --> 2:14:34.180]  in.
[2:14:34.180 --> 2:14:35.180]  But do you agree with me?
[2:14:35.180 --> 2:14:36.780]  Obviously they're trying to set up a false flag.
[2:14:36.780 --> 2:14:40.100]  I mean, clearly they said the Russians want a false flag to go into Ukraine.
[2:14:40.100 --> 2:14:44.100]  Well, I mean, the left is just betting everything that is going to be terror attacks before
[2:14:44.100 --> 2:14:45.100]  the midterms.
[2:14:45.100 --> 2:14:46.100]  Yes.
[2:14:46.100 --> 2:14:47.100]  Yes.
[2:14:47.100 --> 2:14:48.100]  100% confirmed.
[2:14:48.100 --> 2:14:53.460]  It wasn't just you and me guessing this three weeks ago, four weeks ago, and now everyone's
[2:14:53.460 --> 2:14:54.460]  talking about it.
[2:14:54.460 --> 2:14:57.620]  I'm now hearing that from sources inside of D.C.
[2:14:57.620 --> 2:15:00.780]  And so I'm going out of my way to document things.
[2:15:00.780 --> 2:15:06.580]  And I got to tell you, folks, not only is the best yet to come, but we have not begun
[2:15:06.580 --> 2:15:11.540]  to fight back and investigate what really happened in January 6th.
[2:15:11.540 --> 2:15:17.060]  The federal government has more fingerprints on this than you or I even realized, Alex,
[2:15:17.060 --> 2:15:18.860]  and more sources are coming forward.
[2:15:18.860 --> 2:15:23.380]  We need whistleblowers to come forward because what has been done is against the consent
[2:15:23.380 --> 2:15:24.380]  of the government.
[2:15:24.380 --> 2:15:25.380]  That's right.
[2:15:25.380 --> 2:15:29.140]  We've already got more people like Ray Epps being caught by citizen journalists that
[2:15:29.140 --> 2:15:32.100]  were there, obviously FBI operatives.
[2:15:32.100 --> 2:15:35.380]  And you know, the deep state, this is not the 1990s where they can blow up a federal
[2:15:35.380 --> 2:15:36.940]  building and get away with it.
[2:15:36.940 --> 2:15:38.380]  And they have not gotten away with it.
[2:15:38.380 --> 2:15:40.300]  I mean, I've got listeners and prominent people.
[2:15:40.300 --> 2:15:45.940]  I know mad at me that I'm even admitting some idiot patriots thought this was a revolution
[2:15:45.940 --> 2:15:47.100]  too and obviously went in.
[2:15:47.100 --> 2:15:48.540]  No, let's be honest.
[2:15:48.540 --> 2:15:52.940]  But the main stand down and the main provocaturing was the feds and they're going to get the
[2:15:52.940 --> 2:15:53.940]  blame for it.
[2:15:53.940 --> 2:15:54.940]  We'll be right back.
[2:15:54.940 --> 2:16:02.300]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalist.
[2:16:02.300 --> 2:16:04.340]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[2:16:04.340 --> 2:16:10.060]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational.
[2:16:10.060 --> 2:16:11.060]  But we failed.
[2:16:11.060 --> 2:16:12.060]  Yes.
[2:16:12.060 --> 2:16:13.060]  A lot of people are awake.
[2:16:13.060 --> 2:16:14.660]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat footed.
[2:16:14.660 --> 2:16:20.660]  But they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization, great reset.
[2:16:20.660 --> 2:16:24.980]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody
[2:16:24.980 --> 2:16:29.580]  they know about the show because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[2:16:29.580 --> 2:16:32.500]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy and try to stop their agenda.
[2:16:32.500 --> 2:16:34.660]  We've also got to get personally prepared.
[2:16:34.660 --> 2:16:37.660]  And one of the number one things to do is high quality, storeable food.
[2:16:37.660 --> 2:16:42.420]  We've got the best food, ready to ship at very affordable prices at infowarstore.com.
[2:16:42.420 --> 2:16:46.420]  So whether it's a month or a six month or a year supply or specialty diets, it's ready
[2:16:46.420 --> 2:16:48.060]  to ship right now.
[2:16:48.060 --> 2:16:52.980]  Lock your orders in before food prices go up and before there are long lines and waits.
[2:16:52.980 --> 2:16:55.260]  Because believe me, serious times are coming.
[2:16:55.260 --> 2:16:58.140]  Get ready at infowarstore.com.
[2:16:58.140 --> 2:17:05.060]  There is very little contemporary study in the world of the planet's ruling class.
[2:17:05.060 --> 2:17:10.020]  Not in communist China, not in Mexico, not in the United States, not anywhere.
[2:17:10.020 --> 2:17:13.900]  Is there a real study of the planet's ruling class?
[2:17:13.900 --> 2:17:16.020]  And that's done by design.
[2:17:16.020 --> 2:17:22.060]  The large central banks that basically control the planet will penalize and target any academics
[2:17:22.060 --> 2:17:26.940]  that look into, say, the Anglo-American establishment, the founder of the Bilderberg group, the Trilateral
[2:17:26.940 --> 2:17:32.060]  Commission, the United Nations, the whole project of the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers.
[2:17:32.060 --> 2:17:36.300]  Until 10 years ago, the media said the controlled corporate media, the Bilderberg group didn't
[2:17:36.300 --> 2:17:37.300]  exist.
[2:17:37.300 --> 2:17:42.180]  Well, now the Bilderberg group is public, it's former head of the Schilds String Committee,
[2:17:42.180 --> 2:17:46.780]  it's called Schwab, and he has set up the great reset in global government.
[2:17:46.780 --> 2:17:51.860]  And as a liberty movement worldwide, we don't address the globalist head on about the fact
[2:17:51.860 --> 2:17:55.580]  that they are a worldwide authoritarian corporate takeover, we don't have a shot.
[2:17:55.580 --> 2:17:57.180]  We do expose them, we can beat them easily.
[2:17:57.180 --> 2:18:02.740]  UN-run contact tracers aren't coming, they're here, all over the world, from Australia to
[2:18:02.740 --> 2:18:05.180]  the United States, from Canada to Germany.
[2:18:05.180 --> 2:18:08.660]  These tyrants are tracking everything you do, everywhere you go, then coming to your
[2:18:08.660 --> 2:18:14.380]  house and threatening, in some cases, actually, taking people away into the night to their
[2:18:14.380 --> 2:18:15.380]  facilities.
[2:18:15.380 --> 2:18:19.980]  And they're planning in the next year to expand their shield process, where they come and
[2:18:19.980 --> 2:18:24.140]  take, quote, healthy people away and put them in facilities for their safety.
[2:18:24.140 --> 2:18:25.940]  This is nothing less than martial law.
[2:18:25.940 --> 2:18:30.180]  And one big thing you can do to fight back is to get high-quality Faraday cages, many
[2:18:30.180 --> 2:18:34.460]  of which are made here in America and are very compliant, meaning U.S. government military
[2:18:34.460 --> 2:18:37.060]  grade at InfowarsStore.com.
[2:18:37.060 --> 2:18:42.060]  We have the entire line of silent pocket ready to ship to you when you visit InfowarsStore.com.
[2:18:42.060 --> 2:18:47.460]  Again, we have big backpacks, we have special dry bags, we've got them for cell phones,
[2:18:47.460 --> 2:18:52.580]  we've got them for laptops, we've got them for iPads, it's all there at InfowarsStore.com.

[2:18:57.700 --> 2:19:01.780]  I never compromise the quality of ingredients we put in InfowarsLive products.
[2:19:01.780 --> 2:19:05.660]  And that's why for more than two years, we've been sold out of Ultimate Bone Broth.
[2:19:05.660 --> 2:19:09.140]  And we could never get the ingredients again until now.
[2:19:09.140 --> 2:19:13.420]  And we have reformulated and not just used the same ingredients, we've boosted it and
[2:19:13.420 --> 2:19:15.220]  made them even stronger.
[2:19:15.220 --> 2:19:18.860]  So out of all the bone broths out there, I'm telling you, this is next level.
[2:19:18.860 --> 2:19:20.380]  Let's know what it's got in it.
[2:19:20.380 --> 2:19:25.420]  Cutting-edge chicken bone broth protein isolate powder for better flavor and dissolvability.
[2:19:25.420 --> 2:19:30.340]  It's got turmeric root, chaga mushroom, bee pollen, goji berry, alfalfa herb powder and
[2:19:30.340 --> 2:19:34.940]  a bunch of other amazing known berries that turbo charge your body with antioxidants.
[2:19:34.940 --> 2:19:38.460]  And then it's got a bunch of other incredible things like magnesium, potassium and sodium
[2:19:38.460 --> 2:19:39.460]  added.
[2:19:39.460 --> 2:19:41.540]  I mean, this sucker has got everything for your electrolytes.
[2:19:41.540 --> 2:19:45.980]  It's got real organic cocoa butter powder with natural chocolate flavor and a touch
[2:19:45.980 --> 2:19:46.980]  of sea salt.
[2:19:46.980 --> 2:19:47.980]  And it just goes on and on.
[2:19:47.980 --> 2:19:53.780]  It is now back in stock, Ultimate Bone Broth Plus, available at 20% off and free shipping
[2:19:53.780 --> 2:19:58.620]  out of the gates at InfowarsStore.com.
[2:19:58.620 --> 2:20:09.980]  Using a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:20:09.980 --> 2:20:25.500]  Look, I'm just completely honest about history, I'm not a Russophile.
[2:20:25.500 --> 2:20:28.820]  The Russians might stage an attack on their own troops to go into Ukraine.
[2:20:28.820 --> 2:20:31.100]  That's what you do when you start a war.
[2:20:31.100 --> 2:20:32.700]  I mean, most governments do it.
[2:20:32.700 --> 2:20:35.540]  The question is, how many people will they kill?
[2:20:35.540 --> 2:20:39.660]  Or will the globalists attack them and when the Russians fight back, call it a false flag?
[2:20:39.660 --> 2:20:41.540]  That's the big deal.
[2:20:41.540 --> 2:20:48.020]  But it doesn't take a political guru or a political rocket scientist to know that they
[2:20:48.020 --> 2:20:52.460]  don't have wall-to-wall January 6 brainwashing, that imminent terror attacks are coming and
[2:20:52.460 --> 2:20:55.020]  they're going to have to do this with the election or do that with the election.
[2:20:55.020 --> 2:20:58.420]  Whether they're fighting white supremacists and all Republicans are terrorists and Mitch
[2:20:58.420 --> 2:21:02.060]  McConnell doesn't come out last week and say, whoa, you're calling all your opposition
[2:21:02.060 --> 2:21:03.060]  domestic enemies.
[2:21:03.060 --> 2:21:04.060]  This is dangerous.
[2:21:04.060 --> 2:21:11.260]  Finally, I think Ali Alexander, one of the main organizers of Stop the Steel, the Republicans
[2:21:11.260 --> 2:21:14.900]  are getting, and I've got the quotes right here, that Biden and the Democrats want to
[2:21:14.900 --> 2:21:19.540]  quasi-outlaw the Republican Party because calling us racists hasn't worked.
[2:21:19.540 --> 2:21:23.540]  So now they're just going to move into, well, I mean, like they said, the FBI said last
[2:21:23.540 --> 2:21:27.220]  week, the deputy had the Justice Department said, no, no, no, we're not worried about
[2:21:27.220 --> 2:21:28.220]  Al-Qaeda.
[2:21:28.220 --> 2:21:34.540]  We're not worried about, no, no, we're worried about Trump supporters with no real evidence.
[2:21:34.540 --> 2:21:35.540]  So this is a big deal.
[2:21:35.540 --> 2:21:36.540]  That's why I keep harping on it.
[2:21:36.540 --> 2:21:37.540]  What do you think?
[2:21:37.540 --> 2:21:40.980]  It's the perfect convergence of evil.
[2:21:40.980 --> 2:21:46.660]  And that's what we saw, you know, with all of these astrological signs, astronomical
[2:21:46.660 --> 2:21:52.780]  signs, all of this occult stuff that was happening in 2020, we didn't really, I didn't really
[2:21:52.780 --> 2:21:59.940]  understand what it meant, but what it meant was a signal for the global elites to launch
[2:21:59.940 --> 2:22:03.620]  their reframing of peaceful citizens.
[2:22:03.620 --> 2:22:05.460]  This is the end of liberty, right?
[2:22:05.460 --> 2:22:08.380]  That era is over for our technocrats.
[2:22:08.380 --> 2:22:13.780]  What they want is they want free citizens to be surveilled 24-7.
[2:22:13.780 --> 2:22:19.980]  And they think that that is freedom because we will get more material good and less metaphysical
[2:22:19.980 --> 2:22:20.980]  good.
[2:22:20.980 --> 2:22:24.860]  And they're here to rage against the machine and say, no, we won't go.
[2:22:24.860 --> 2:22:26.220]  We won't go.
[2:22:26.220 --> 2:22:28.460]  And we will be civilly disobedient.
[2:22:28.460 --> 2:22:30.380]  We will peacefully protest.
[2:22:30.380 --> 2:22:34.180]  And I got to tell you, Alex, you know, I believe in the right of revolution.
[2:22:34.180 --> 2:22:36.660]  Maybe, you know, maybe you don't want me to say this.
[2:22:36.660 --> 2:22:37.660]  Maybe no one wants me to say it.
[2:22:37.660 --> 2:22:38.660]  No, no, no, go ahead and say it.
[2:22:38.660 --> 2:22:39.660]  I believe in the Declaration of Independence.
[2:22:39.660 --> 2:22:41.940]  We have a right to overthrow a corrupt government.
[2:22:41.940 --> 2:22:46.460]  I'm saying at this point, they want to have a physical fight because we're intellectually
[2:22:46.460 --> 2:22:47.460]  winning.
[2:22:47.460 --> 2:22:48.460]  Right.
[2:22:48.460 --> 2:22:50.380]  And that's what I wrote this, okay?
[2:22:50.380 --> 2:22:56.780]  On members.alealexander.org, if the team wants to bring up my July 4th post, I reaffirmed
[2:22:56.780 --> 2:23:03.700]  my commitment to the Declaration of Independence, even though I'm being prosecuted, essentially,
[2:23:03.700 --> 2:23:06.500]  for saying the word 1776.
[2:23:06.500 --> 2:23:10.660]  And the committee asked me, why did you say 1776?
[2:23:10.660 --> 2:23:16.100]  Because that's when we declared our spiritual, metaphysical, and written Declaration of
[2:23:16.100 --> 2:23:17.940]  Independence, that violence...
[2:23:17.940 --> 2:23:21.780]  Okay, you're declaring your sovereignty, you're declaring the birth of the country, you're
[2:23:21.780 --> 2:23:26.940]  declaring the moment that the life began, and that scares them, well, that means they're
[2:23:26.940 --> 2:23:27.940]  not Americans.
[2:23:27.940 --> 2:23:28.940]  Right.
[2:23:28.940 --> 2:23:32.660]  And it was the king that invaded America.
[2:23:32.660 --> 2:23:37.380]  It wasn't Americans that went to England looking for a fight, and so I tell my government,
[2:23:37.380 --> 2:23:46.100]  I declare my independence, stop the deal, 1776, and November 3rd was stolen.
[2:23:46.100 --> 2:23:50.660]  And I'm not going to kowtow and bow down, but I'm also not going to encourage a violent
[2:23:50.660 --> 2:23:58.420]  rebellion or revolution that would be doomed to fail and set back, set back our liberties
[2:23:58.420 --> 2:23:59.420]  from around the world.
[2:23:59.420 --> 2:24:05.980]  So, Alex, I just think it's so important that people listen to you, listen to me, frankly,
[2:24:05.980 --> 2:24:09.180]  too, and follow this prudent, wise leadership.
[2:24:09.180 --> 2:24:16.220]  This is why you see so many people turning to their faith because the Republican Party
[2:24:16.220 --> 2:24:20.020]  has failed, but you're right, and to observe that Mitch McConnell and the rest of these
[2:24:20.020 --> 2:24:24.620]  hats are realizing they're not coming for Alex Jones and Oli Alexander, they're coming
[2:24:24.620 --> 2:24:30.980]  for the whole kid and caboodle, believers, patriots, Southerners, Jehovah Witnesses,
[2:24:30.980 --> 2:24:33.140]  they're coming for everybody, okay?
[2:24:33.140 --> 2:24:40.020]  And to this end, on the American spectator, spectator.org, my article, my op-ed is number
[2:24:40.020 --> 2:24:44.980]  one, and it's been number one for eight days running, where I exporiated Mitch McConnell.
[2:24:44.980 --> 2:24:49.580]  I said, don't you compromise with them on what's called the Electoral Count Act, which
[2:24:49.580 --> 2:24:55.020]  is really the anti-Alex Jones, Oli Alexander Peaceful Protest Act, the Electoral Count
[2:24:55.020 --> 2:24:59.940]  Act says no more electoral college objections ever again in the future.
[2:24:59.940 --> 2:25:06.780]  We say over our dead bodies, and so the Democrats are trying to put in fake voting rights bills
[2:25:06.780 --> 2:25:08.460]  that federalize our election.
[2:25:08.460 --> 2:25:12.380]  So I told Mitch McConnell, because he started compromising with them, because he was listening
[2:25:12.380 --> 2:25:14.540]  to the National Review, a rhino outlet.
[2:25:14.540 --> 2:25:15.540]  I said, don't compromise.
[2:25:15.540 --> 2:25:21.260]  Then he got burnt, and then you saw his positive comments, so Republicans, believers, everyone
[2:25:21.260 --> 2:25:22.260]  needs to wake up.
[2:25:22.260 --> 2:25:23.540]  They're coming for all of us.
[2:25:23.540 --> 2:25:25.900]  They don't want free and fair elections this year.
[2:25:25.900 --> 2:25:26.900]  They're all in.
[2:25:26.900 --> 2:25:27.900]  They can't run on Afghanistan.
[2:25:27.900 --> 2:25:28.900]  They can't run on inflation.
[2:25:28.900 --> 2:25:30.540]  They can't run on COVID.
[2:25:30.540 --> 2:25:32.580]  They can't run on the response to COVID.
[2:25:32.580 --> 2:25:34.900]  They are running on Alex Jones.
[2:25:34.900 --> 2:25:40.460]  They are running on Oli Alexander, and they want us to answer for the most foolish actions
[2:25:40.460 --> 2:25:42.500]  of people who have nothing to do with us.
[2:25:42.500 --> 2:25:44.660]  And I'm just telling them, I'm not going to shut up.
[2:25:44.660 --> 2:25:47.980]  I'm not going away, and I'm not going to cooperate with the false narrative.
[2:25:47.980 --> 2:25:51.300]  And by the way, we're not trying to act like we're big league here.
[2:25:51.300 --> 2:25:53.060]  It's very scary in the big leagues.
[2:25:53.060 --> 2:25:58.820]  We got calls from high-level justice department and high-level CIA in the last 48 hours.
[2:25:58.820 --> 2:26:02.660]  And anyhow, I do talk to the Justice Department, the CIA, people that are good in there.
[2:26:02.660 --> 2:26:05.340]  And they said, oh, yeah, that's what you just said, exactly.
[2:26:05.340 --> 2:26:09.140]  They're running on January 6th, and that we're dead on.
[2:26:09.140 --> 2:26:12.460]  And I'm like, well, we can't tell you anything, but you're dead on, and watch out.
[2:26:12.460 --> 2:26:13.780]  We're saying prayers for you.
[2:26:13.780 --> 2:26:15.900]  So yeah, it's a really creepy feeling.
[2:26:15.900 --> 2:26:20.900]  I've never had more wings of death flapping around above me feeling, but I knew this was
[2:26:20.900 --> 2:26:24.540]  always coming to this, that here we are wanting peace, here we are wanting justice.
[2:26:24.540 --> 2:26:28.540]  And they literally want to then set some horrible new mass shooting or bombing.
[2:26:28.540 --> 2:26:31.300]  I don't know what it's going to be, and then they're going to blame us, Ollie.
[2:26:31.300 --> 2:26:35.900]  And I just don't know what we do to not just protect our own butts, but to tell conservatives
[2:26:35.900 --> 2:26:40.780]  and Christians and others, don't be violent, watch your rhetoric, and also know obviously
[2:26:40.780 --> 2:26:45.620]  patriots aren't going to do this, and violence isn't the answer.
[2:26:45.620 --> 2:26:47.100]  You're exactly right, folks.
[2:26:47.100 --> 2:26:48.940]  This is not a game.
[2:26:48.940 --> 2:26:53.020]  This is not a holographic simulation.
[2:26:53.020 --> 2:26:55.660]  We're not larpers, and this isn't cosplay.
[2:26:55.660 --> 2:26:57.540]  Your freedoms are at stake.
[2:26:57.540 --> 2:26:59.100]  Your freedoms are at stake.
[2:26:59.100 --> 2:27:02.180]  If Owen Shroyer goes down, you lose freedom.
[2:27:02.180 --> 2:27:04.500]  If Alex Jones goes down, you lose freedom.
[2:27:04.500 --> 2:27:10.220]  If Ollie Alexander goes down, or they outlaw the phrase, stop the steal, or ban links to
[2:27:10.220 --> 2:27:13.420]  infowars.com, your freedoms go away.
[2:27:13.420 --> 2:27:15.860]  The freedoms of Black Lives Matter goes away.
[2:27:15.860 --> 2:27:20.140]  The freedoms of left-wing anarchists go away.
[2:27:20.140 --> 2:27:23.980]  So we're in this all together, which means we can't have violence.
[2:27:23.980 --> 2:27:27.940]  We can't have something that separates us from our neighbor.
[2:27:27.940 --> 2:27:32.980]  And so I'm sad that Barack Obama ruined the phrase, I am my brother's keeper, but that's
[2:27:32.980 --> 2:27:34.380]  something I've always believed.
[2:27:34.380 --> 2:27:37.940]  As a Christian, I have an obligation to the stranger.
[2:27:37.940 --> 2:27:40.580]  I have an obligation to the stranger.
[2:27:40.580 --> 2:27:45.180]  Now these economic, objectivist libertarians might not believe that, but I'm Christian,
[2:27:45.180 --> 2:27:47.180]  and I believe that.
[2:27:47.180 --> 2:27:52.700]  And Alex, that's why you and I ran to the Capitol when we saw civil disorder.
[2:27:52.700 --> 2:27:54.380]  We were like, okay, we need to stay alive.
[2:27:54.380 --> 2:27:57.540]  What if that scaffolding falls and kills people?
[2:27:57.540 --> 2:28:03.420]  So I think Alex, it's just important for us to walk in the light, for us to walk in
[2:28:03.420 --> 2:28:05.540]  the Word of Jesus Christ and be prudent.
[2:28:05.540 --> 2:28:11.100]  And remember, Jesus who preached peace and didn't become that militant leader that the
[2:28:11.100 --> 2:28:16.500]  Sanhedrin wanted him to become, still was whipping people out of the temple.
[2:28:16.500 --> 2:28:20.820]  And it's just very nuanced, and we've got to be very prudent and very wise about our
[2:28:20.820 --> 2:28:21.820]  word.
[2:28:21.820 --> 2:28:22.820]  It doesn't mean whip.
[2:28:22.820 --> 2:28:25.100]  It means you've got to really be smart and think things through.
[2:28:25.100 --> 2:28:28.860]  And if the enemy wants violence, it's because they're losing, let's not give it to them.
[2:28:28.860 --> 2:28:31.540]  There are times when a giant army's invading, there's no choice.
[2:28:31.540 --> 2:28:32.540]  That's a clear attack.
[2:28:32.540 --> 2:28:33.540]  Your people know what's going on.
[2:28:33.540 --> 2:28:34.540]  You fight.
[2:28:34.540 --> 2:28:38.380]  But when the enemy is hidden, you don't play into a game to attack the enemy, and then
[2:28:38.380 --> 2:28:40.860]  he poses as if he's the people.
[2:28:40.860 --> 2:28:45.340]  We've got to educate people first, and then try to fix things peacefully.
[2:28:45.340 --> 2:28:46.900]  And then if there's a war, there's a war.
[2:28:46.900 --> 2:28:50.140]  We've got to do everything we can in God's eyes peacefully.
[2:28:50.140 --> 2:28:52.420]  And then if we have to fight, God will be on our side.
[2:28:52.420 --> 2:28:57.020]  Stay with us.
[2:28:57.020 --> 2:29:01.940]  Everything we've witnessed in the last few decades has only been the build-up for what
[2:29:01.940 --> 2:29:03.900]  the globalists are doing right now.
[2:29:03.900 --> 2:29:05.620]  This is their big offensive.
[2:29:05.620 --> 2:29:07.060]  This is their takeover.
[2:29:07.060 --> 2:29:10.220]  And this is the point that they're at their very weakest, because now they've revealed
[2:29:10.220 --> 2:29:11.220]  themselves.
[2:29:11.220 --> 2:29:12.220]  Now they're a world government.
[2:29:12.220 --> 2:29:13.620]  They're permanent martial law.
[2:29:13.620 --> 2:29:16.020]  Their medical tyranny is out in the open.
[2:29:16.020 --> 2:29:20.560]  Their depopulation agenda has been exposed, but they're using their corporate power and
[2:29:20.560 --> 2:29:24.820]  trillions to go across the planet and shut down people telling the truth.
[2:29:24.820 --> 2:29:28.100]  So listen, Paul Revere's, when you spread the word about the broadcast, when you pray
[2:29:28.100 --> 2:29:30.020]  for the broadcast, you're the tip of the spear.
[2:29:30.020 --> 2:29:33.740]  And when you buy products at infowarstore.com, you keep us on air.
[2:29:33.740 --> 2:29:36.740]  Plus, we've got great products that have been sold out for months that are back in
[2:29:36.740 --> 2:29:41.060]  stock, 50% off, X2 and Winter Sun.
[2:29:41.060 --> 2:29:44.660]  Both of these are on our top five best sellers that are so good for your body, and if there's
[2:29:44.660 --> 2:29:47.820]  two things you do for your body, it's these two products.
[2:29:47.820 --> 2:29:52.460]  They're all back in stock at infowarstore.com, 50% off, and it keeps us on the air.
[2:29:52.460 --> 2:29:54.860]  Only way we fail is if you don't take action.
[2:29:54.860 --> 2:30:00.180]  This is a great sponsor.
[2:30:00.180 --> 2:30:03.780]  We have one of the best deals you're going to find out there on a high quality, high
[2:30:03.780 --> 2:30:08.460]  rated, satellite phone, so you can't be tracked, so you can't be traced, and it'll work anywhere
[2:30:08.460 --> 2:30:10.260]  in the world where you can see the sky.
[2:30:10.260 --> 2:30:14.060]  You can also buy cheap antennas and things for your car in your house that also are on
[2:30:14.060 --> 2:30:15.060]  the site infowarstore.com.
[2:30:15.060 --> 2:30:18.060]  That's just a side detection of these folks.
[2:30:18.060 --> 2:30:22.260]  They supply the board with their systems as well, they're amazing folks, and you get
[2:30:22.260 --> 2:30:29.260]  a free phone, a $650 value, absolutely free at infowarstore.com.
[2:30:29.260 --> 2:30:31.340]  Smartphones are always tracking everything you do.
[2:30:31.340 --> 2:30:33.740]  These aren't, and the calls are free when folks call you.
[2:30:33.740 --> 2:30:39.540]  You just pay $99.95 a month for your minutes, $150 minutes, so the calls you were free
[2:30:39.540 --> 2:30:43.300]  were like a regular cell phone, you're not being tracked or traced, and I keep on my car,
[2:30:43.300 --> 2:30:46.580]  I've given it to my parents as gifts, way out the middle of nowhere where regular phones
[2:30:46.580 --> 2:30:56.420]  don't work, they work, infowarstore.com or 941-955-1029-41955, 1020 and ask the Alex Jones special.
[2:30:56.420 --> 2:31:03.300]  In late August, infowar saw an explosion of orders because our audience understands that
[2:31:03.300 --> 2:31:09.540]  the globalists are destabilizing the planet by design and are attempting to cause an economic
[2:31:09.540 --> 2:31:12.660]  and financial collapse worldwide.
[2:31:12.660 --> 2:31:15.700]  Now ladies and gentlemen, storeable food has always been something that's important to
[2:31:15.700 --> 2:31:19.540]  have, it's a check box that everybody needs to have, taking care of, right along with
[2:31:19.540 --> 2:31:23.700]  water filtration, self-defense, and a relationship with God.
[2:31:23.700 --> 2:31:27.980]  But now more than ever, you need to get your storeable food orders in, now we're ready
[2:31:27.980 --> 2:31:32.660]  to ship to you within 24 hours of your order, it's high quality, it's very, very low cost
[2:31:32.660 --> 2:31:38.060]  at infowarstore.com because in the future, you're going to see more food supply shortages
[2:31:38.060 --> 2:31:41.860]  and you're going to see food supply price increases that are already taking place.
[2:31:41.860 --> 2:31:48.180]  So lock in your storeable food now at a lower price and fund the infowar at infowarstore.com.
[2:31:48.180 --> 2:31:52.020]  That's how you fight the great reset is by being self-sufficient and not under their
[2:31:52.020 --> 2:31:53.020]  control.
[2:31:53.020 --> 2:31:56.580]  So get prepared now at infowarstore.com.
[2:31:56.580 --> 2:32:02.100]  The purpose of fear is to call us into action and there is plenty to be afraid of today.
[2:32:02.100 --> 2:32:07.780]  Half the population has lined up for an untested, deadly and debilitating experimental injection
[2:32:07.780 --> 2:32:12.020]  because they were told to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease.
[2:32:12.020 --> 2:32:17.140]  The perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal of having 80% of the population
[2:32:17.140 --> 2:32:21.980]  hooked up to an artificial intelligence hive mind in less than nine years.
[2:32:21.980 --> 2:32:26.420]  For those of us who have awoken from the spell, we know this is all really happening and it's
[2:32:26.420 --> 2:32:31.300]  unbelievably unsettling to see, but there is only two things to do.
[2:32:31.300 --> 2:32:34.420]  We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game.
[2:32:34.420 --> 2:32:37.820]  If enough people awaken from the cold spell, then we win.
[2:32:37.820 --> 2:32:42.460]  But even when we win, and we eventually will, the days of convenience are soon coming to
[2:32:42.460 --> 2:32:43.460]  an end.
[2:32:43.460 --> 2:32:49.220]  And so we must prepare, get up to a years worth of storeable foods, water filtration, survival
[2:32:49.220 --> 2:32:58.580]  gear, seeds, shortwave radios, and life-saving knowledge at infowarstore.com.
[2:32:58.580 --> 2:33:14.980]  Leading of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:14.980 --> 2:33:30.420]  Ladies and gentlemen, the news on infowarstore.com right now is just incredible.
[2:33:30.420 --> 2:33:34.060]  I don't even know how to describe the stuff.
[2:33:34.060 --> 2:33:38.900]  No VACs, no food, NYPD tickets, wheelchair bound woman with cerebral palsy and arrest
[2:33:38.900 --> 2:33:42.420]  11 others for trying to get a store to buy food.
[2:33:42.420 --> 2:33:48.620]  MIT scientist says COVID vaccine can trigger neurodegenerative diseases, warrants parents
[2:33:48.620 --> 2:33:53.060]  against vaccinating children, corporate media attacks justice Gorsuch, who's one of the
[2:33:53.060 --> 2:33:57.580]  few good things Trump did dealing with courts for not wearing a mask.
[2:33:57.580 --> 2:34:07.700]  He's got the CEO, NBA co-owners of a major team saying he didn't care about death camps,
[2:34:07.700 --> 2:34:12.540]  U.S. Army, guerrilla warfare, exercise and target freedom fighters, that's just some
[2:34:12.540 --> 2:34:16.540]  of the stuff on infowarstore.com, I mean it's just crazy.
[2:34:16.540 --> 2:34:21.660]  Going back to Ali Alexander, again I want to be a trillion percent clear with the listeners.
[2:34:21.660 --> 2:34:26.980]  I don't sit up here and cover stories just because I'm in them.
[2:34:26.980 --> 2:34:29.380]  There's a lot of stories we're in on my covering.
[2:34:29.380 --> 2:34:33.500]  The fact that we're right at the center in January 6, the fact that the system you turn
[2:34:33.500 --> 2:34:38.420]  on the TV only talks about that, I mean more than anything else, is a distraction from
[2:34:38.420 --> 2:34:42.340]  inflation, a distraction from people losing their jobs, a distraction from the fentanyl
[2:34:42.340 --> 2:34:47.100]  desk, a distraction from the open borders or imminent war with Russia.
[2:34:47.100 --> 2:34:51.820]  I mean you've got NATO saying we're on the verge of war and instead we're hearing about
[2:34:51.820 --> 2:35:00.500]  oh the Trump supporters, the million, they all wanted to attack the capital, it's insanity.
[2:35:00.500 --> 2:35:06.500]  And I think Ali, it shows some real mental illness by America's ruling class that stole
[2:35:06.500 --> 2:35:10.740]  their way into power, is that they're blaming all their illegitimacy on us not wanting to
[2:35:10.740 --> 2:35:17.340]  be ruled by idiots and blaming their own constituents, I mean very rarely in history, you're historian
[2:35:17.340 --> 2:35:20.300]  as well, you're a sharp guy, I talk to you a lot.
[2:35:20.300 --> 2:35:24.860]  What do you make of the Democrats now, not just Paul Begala but Jen Psaki and others
[2:35:24.860 --> 2:35:30.020]  saying, our followers don't know how great they've got it, it's your fault, I mean what
[2:35:30.020 --> 2:35:35.220]  do you make of just the current political lay of the land?
[2:35:35.220 --> 2:35:41.580]  Well the first observation I want to make is that yet you and I are both lovers of history,
[2:35:41.580 --> 2:35:49.300]  we both have acted as publishers for respective news gathering and dissemination organizations
[2:35:49.300 --> 2:35:54.180]  and we're activists, sometimes we're in this capacity, other times we're in that capacity.
[2:35:54.180 --> 2:36:01.620]  And so you and I have both made statements of analyses where we've observed America appears
[2:36:01.620 --> 2:36:03.460]  to be approaching a civil war.
[2:36:03.460 --> 2:36:06.740]  Now the Democrats and the media try to use that against us, say we're stoking a civil
[2:36:06.740 --> 2:36:13.940]  war, even though we say we are opposed to one, but it's an observation worth noting.
[2:36:13.940 --> 2:36:20.620]  And you can see that these Democrat operatives who are fully aware of their turnout games,
[2:36:20.620 --> 2:36:27.740]  of their rigging on the lawful side elections and the illegal rigging that also goes on,
[2:36:27.740 --> 2:36:32.340]  Peter Navarro talks about how there's illegal theft and there's legal theft and he's right
[2:36:32.340 --> 2:36:33.340]  in that.
[2:36:33.340 --> 2:36:42.380]  In that they are so, they know they've so lost the middle, they so have lost the neutral
[2:36:42.380 --> 2:36:47.220]  person that they need a market to, that their base is caving and they know in marketing you
[2:36:47.220 --> 2:36:52.420]  got to first get your customer back and so that they've lost their customer means that
[2:36:52.420 --> 2:36:56.500]  they're going to increasingly be desperate and because Democrat operatives are very different
[2:36:56.500 --> 2:37:02.300]  than Republican operatives and Democrat circles, the comms and political people help make national
[2:37:02.300 --> 2:37:03.300]  security decisions.
[2:37:03.300 --> 2:37:10.220]  Okay, this is scary as hell and so Saki and the rest of these fools are hoping in their
[2:37:10.220 --> 2:37:18.380]  comms department for another 9-11, you have the White House comms department hoping and
[2:37:18.380 --> 2:37:25.860]  praying for another 9-11, these people are godless, so they don't believe that there's
[2:37:25.860 --> 2:37:30.060]  any consequences in the hereafter for something like that.
[2:37:30.060 --> 2:37:36.220]  Jesus reminds us that murder begins in the heart, that adultery begins in the eyes, so
[2:37:36.220 --> 2:37:40.900]  you and I, we're not only like, not only will we not do that, we're not even allowed to
[2:37:40.900 --> 2:37:41.900]  think that way.
[2:37:41.900 --> 2:37:45.340]  Well plus I don't even want to, I desperately want the opposite, not even because I'm a
[2:37:45.340 --> 2:37:49.980]  perfect person, that's what the evil wants, they want the violence, exactly, Saki and
[2:37:49.980 --> 2:37:54.300]  others are dreaming of war with Russia, they're not even smart enough like George W. Bush
[2:37:54.300 --> 2:37:58.780]  to go attack a third world nation with no nukes, no let's go attack the second most
[2:37:58.780 --> 2:38:04.460]  powerful country and most sophisticated next to us, that's a wonderful idea if you want
[2:38:04.460 --> 2:38:09.300]  to war as a distraction honey, do like Ronald Reagan and make a Grenada or something, what
[2:38:09.300 --> 2:38:12.700]  is your problem?
[2:38:12.700 --> 2:38:18.140]  They're insane and they're godless, and this is why we have had great Christian philosophers
[2:38:18.140 --> 2:38:24.700]  say the spirit is not contrary to reason, when the two are present, they're god in,
[2:38:24.700 --> 2:38:31.140]  and so we're painted as the anti-enlightenment folks when we are the pro-reason folks, and
[2:38:31.140 --> 2:38:36.300]  so we have to remember that we are the classical liberals, they are the opposite of liberalism,
[2:38:36.300 --> 2:38:41.620]  we are flaming liberals, we want freedom and openness and low taxes and empowerment,
[2:38:41.620 --> 2:38:45.620]  that's liberal, liberal is to let the common people have guns, liberals will let common
[2:38:45.620 --> 2:38:49.700]  people raise their kids, liberals let common people have land, liberals let the common
[2:38:49.700 --> 2:38:54.820]  people travel, nobody had that until 500 years ago, and then that experiment grew and the
[2:38:54.820 --> 2:38:58.980]  globalists are at war with that because they don't want the third world aspiring to that
[2:38:58.980 --> 2:39:03.700]  and saying we want that, that's why America's got to be repudiated and taken down.
[2:39:03.700 --> 2:39:08.260]  Creatured brother, I mean that's actually it, we liberated power not from God and not
[2:39:08.260 --> 2:39:12.340]  from the church, but from the state, so in that sense I'm a class of the liberal, but
[2:39:12.340 --> 2:39:15.820]  there's a lot of things like I'm actually okay with higher taxes now, I wasn't, but
[2:39:15.820 --> 2:39:16.820]  now I'm like if we can take care of the common people-
[2:39:16.820 --> 2:39:20.180]  Well I wasn't trying to define yourself, what would you define yourself as, classical
[2:39:20.180 --> 2:39:21.180]  Christian?
[2:39:21.180 --> 2:39:25.420]  Well I don't know anymore, I mean I thought I was a conservative but now I'm more nationalist,
[2:39:25.420 --> 2:39:30.540]  I'll tell you this, my identity is in Christ and my identity is my love for my neighbor,
[2:39:30.540 --> 2:39:36.340]  okay, that my black neighbors feel like they're mistreated by the police, okay let's solve
[2:39:36.340 --> 2:39:42.460]  that, that my white neighbors are being targeted by the media and Hollywood with this anti-white
[2:39:42.460 --> 2:39:47.180]  hate or they need to get in line for treatment in the back of the bus, in the back of the
[2:39:47.180 --> 2:39:53.300]  line for treatment of COVID, that needs to be solved and so I just, you know I'm a true
[2:39:53.300 --> 2:39:57.020]  lover, I'm a true lover, but I'm also someone who believes that love becomes in the form
[2:39:57.020 --> 2:40:02.900]  of correction and rebuke and truth, hard truth, so I know it's complicated for the left and
[2:40:02.900 --> 2:40:06.980]  the godless not to understand what we're saying, but you're very right that we, that we are
[2:40:06.980 --> 2:40:13.740]  people who advocate the classical liberation of power from the state, that it may be federated
[2:40:13.740 --> 2:40:18.220]  locally to the people and managed there and that some rights need to go to the state and
[2:40:18.220 --> 2:40:23.060]  some rights need to go to the federal government, but as many rights as we can get to the people
[2:40:23.060 --> 2:40:28.940]  who have a common interest as Cicero wrote, that makes a republic, so you and I knew that
[2:40:28.940 --> 2:40:32.660]  if they stole the election it was illegitimate, they wouldn't be able to manage it because
[2:40:32.660 --> 2:40:37.820]  they were getting fake signals, they were interpreting noise as signals, so when they
[2:40:37.820 --> 2:40:44.500]  trot out, you know we, voter ideas is voter suppression and the polls say that a majority
[2:40:44.500 --> 2:40:52.260]  of black support voter ID, you and I know that that is a recipe for division and debate
[2:40:52.260 --> 2:40:57.700]  and not for solutions and unity and so I got to tell you Alex, we're in a weird point
[2:40:57.700 --> 2:41:01.660]  in history and I watched your broadcast this weekend where you're like I think I need to
[2:41:01.660 --> 2:41:10.900]  take a break, that's good, you know Jesus meditated, John the Baptist meditated, there
[2:41:10.900 --> 2:41:14.860]  are often times when, and again we don't want to be stuck in the middle of this, but we're
[2:41:14.860 --> 2:41:19.620]  sure as hell not going to go down without a legal fight and that's why I need the support
[2:41:19.620 --> 2:41:26.540]  of people at GibsonGo.com slash Ali Alexander, I know that you need the support of the people,
[2:41:26.540 --> 2:41:30.540]  it's hard to get a lawyer in these cases, but we're fighting back and I just think
[2:41:30.540 --> 2:41:34.620]  that the listeners need to fight back in the right way, the legislative way, the legal
[2:41:34.620 --> 2:41:40.380]  way, the political way, the civil way and we don't need, they want to break up our country,
[2:41:40.380 --> 2:41:44.460]  they want left versus right, when we know it's up versus down and we want to appeal
[2:41:44.460 --> 2:41:50.340]  to heaven so that it intervenes and we overcome this darkness.
[2:41:50.340 --> 2:41:54.140]  I totally agree, let's do one more segment and get into the Federal Commando teams that
[2:41:54.140 --> 2:41:58.460]  were there and how the media just hopes that goes away and then Joe Rogan talking to McMaster
[2:41:58.460 --> 2:42:02.740]  on the other side, but give out your donation page, I know they've almost financially destroyed
[2:42:02.740 --> 2:42:06.300]  you and we come to the audience for support, we appreciate the audience, but if folks want
[2:42:06.300 --> 2:42:10.100]  to help you because you didn't roll over to the committee, you told the truth about everything,
[2:42:10.100 --> 2:42:13.060]  even the only people that have the courage to do it even though they could now try to
[2:42:13.060 --> 2:42:14.700]  set you up in burgery traps.
[2:42:14.700 --> 2:42:23.460]  Yeah, I appreciate the opportunity to plug Alex, it's givesindgo.com slash Ali Alexander,
[2:42:23.460 --> 2:42:27.420]  none of this money goes to my bank account, none of this money goes to me, it all gets
[2:42:27.420 --> 2:42:31.460]  routed through one of my attorneys who is leading three other attorneys, so I've had
[2:42:31.460 --> 2:42:36.740]  to have four attorneys, criminal law, constitutional law and then two other attorneys.
[2:42:36.740 --> 2:42:42.260]  I'm suing Nancy Pelosi, I'm suing the committee, I'm suing Liz Cheney because I refuse to
[2:42:42.260 --> 2:42:47.540]  die for them, okay, I refuse to go down for them, I refuse to denounce my side for them,
[2:42:47.540 --> 2:42:50.180]  we need to speak truth to power, so I appreciate any of the listeners.

[2:45:56.940 --> 2:46:02.220]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalists, I wanted
[2:46:02.220 --> 2:46:03.820]  to stop their agenda.
[2:46:03.820 --> 2:46:09.500]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational,
[2:46:09.500 --> 2:46:10.500]  but we failed.
[2:46:10.500 --> 2:46:14.500]  Yes, a lot of people are awake, yes we're not getting caught flat footed, but they are
[2:46:14.500 --> 2:46:20.900]  going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization great reset, and that's why it's more
[2:46:20.900 --> 2:46:25.260]  important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the
[2:46:25.260 --> 2:46:29.020]  show because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[2:46:29.020 --> 2:46:32.340]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy and trying to stop their agenda, we've
[2:46:32.340 --> 2:46:36.180]  also got to get personally prepared, and one of the number one things to do is high quality

[2:46:58.740 --> 2:47:18.300]  Using a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:47:18.300 --> 2:47:20.260]  We are in the twilight zone.
[2:47:20.260 --> 2:47:27.580]  Just in the last week, I've seen two Olympic runners, one a sprinter, one the champion marathoner.
[2:47:27.580 --> 2:47:31.220]  Both have microcarditis and now having to look at retiring.
[2:47:31.220 --> 2:47:36.860]  Olympic sprinter announces pericarditis, heart swelling, heart infection, diagnosis on Facebook
[2:47:36.860 --> 2:47:38.580]  following booster jab.
[2:47:38.580 --> 2:47:42.660]  They made her take the Moderna, and of course she got sick, but then when they made her
[2:47:42.660 --> 2:47:50.140]  take the Pfizer on top, now she's got serious heart problems, young, beautiful woman.
[2:47:50.140 --> 2:47:54.420]  Read the whole article at InfoWareStore.com.
[2:47:54.420 --> 2:47:56.820]  Killing ourselves, be able to even go outside and have a job.
[2:47:56.820 --> 2:48:02.740]  All right, let's get back into January 6th with Ali Alexander because, again, I'm sick
[2:48:02.740 --> 2:48:03.740]  of it.
[2:48:03.740 --> 2:48:04.860]  It's old news.
[2:48:04.860 --> 2:48:07.940]  We know it was provocateur, most of it, some usefulity, it's went in.
[2:48:07.940 --> 2:48:09.460]  Most people are totally nonviolent.
[2:48:09.460 --> 2:48:10.460]  They were patriots.
[2:48:10.460 --> 2:48:12.940]  They shouldn't be in trouble.
[2:48:12.940 --> 2:48:15.660]  But they are selling their whole system on this.
[2:48:15.660 --> 2:48:20.140]  So here was an article back in January 3rd, exclusive secret commandos with Shoot to Kill
[2:48:20.140 --> 2:48:24.060]  Authority were at the Capitol, over a thousand of them.
[2:48:24.060 --> 2:48:30.780]  They didn't stop the first few hundred that broke through the almost undefended Capitol.
[2:48:30.780 --> 2:48:35.100]  And then we've got McMaster over here on Joe Rogan a few days ago, just finally got out
[2:48:35.100 --> 2:48:36.100]  to InfoWars.
[2:48:36.100 --> 2:48:37.100]  H.R.
[2:48:37.100 --> 2:48:40.740]  McMaster says he can't fathom FBI using Asian provocateurs.
[2:48:40.740 --> 2:48:46.980]  That's like saying he can't fathom a duck quacking or he can't fathom a wolf howling
[2:48:46.980 --> 2:48:51.060]  or he can't fathom a rooster crowing.
[2:48:51.060 --> 2:48:53.940]  I mean, it's just such a well-known documented thing.
[2:48:53.940 --> 2:48:56.980]  Here is part of the ridiculous exchange.
[2:48:56.980 --> 2:49:02.020]  Did you see Ted Cruz question that woman, I don't remember her name.
[2:49:02.020 --> 2:49:08.220]  She's from the FBI and he asked her about Asian provocateurs at January 6th and whether
[2:49:08.220 --> 2:49:12.180]  or not they engaged in any activity there.
[2:49:12.180 --> 2:49:16.300]  And she said she could not answer that and whether or not they engaged in encouraging
[2:49:16.300 --> 2:49:18.420]  violence and she could not answer that.
[2:49:18.420 --> 2:49:19.620]  Like, did you see that?
[2:49:19.620 --> 2:49:20.620]  I didn't see it.
[2:49:20.620 --> 2:49:23.220]  But I mean, I would be surprised if there weren't, right?
[2:49:23.220 --> 2:49:27.220]  Well, now the thing is why do they do that?
[2:49:27.220 --> 2:49:30.020]  Why would the FBI engage in that?
[2:49:30.020 --> 2:49:31.020]  Not answer.
[2:49:31.020 --> 2:49:32.020]  Oh, the FBI wouldn't.
[2:49:32.020 --> 2:49:35.780]  That's what they were talking about, Asian provocateurs.
[2:49:35.780 --> 2:49:37.460]  Not from us, I wouldn't say.
[2:49:37.460 --> 2:49:41.860]  Now I would say there might be FBI agents who infiltrate organizations that have a violent
[2:49:41.860 --> 2:49:42.860]  agenda.
[2:49:42.860 --> 2:49:43.860]  Right?
[2:49:43.860 --> 2:49:44.860]  We want them to do that.
[2:49:44.860 --> 2:49:45.860]  But I thought you were talking about the Russians.
[2:49:45.860 --> 2:49:47.420]  I think what the Russians are trying to do is...
[2:49:47.420 --> 2:49:55.620]  That FBI agents that, if the FBI agents were involved in January 6th, that doesn't sound
[2:49:55.620 --> 2:49:56.620]  right to me.
[2:49:56.620 --> 2:49:57.620]  I mean, I don't know why they're here about it.
[2:49:57.620 --> 2:49:58.620]  What doesn't sound right?
[2:49:58.620 --> 2:49:59.620]  Agent provocateurs?
[2:49:59.620 --> 2:50:00.620]  Yeah, agent provocateurs from the government.
[2:50:00.620 --> 2:50:02.620]  I mean, I can't imagine they would do that.
[2:50:02.620 --> 2:50:05.500]  Well, why wouldn't she just say no?
[2:50:05.500 --> 2:50:06.500]  I don't know.
[2:50:06.500 --> 2:50:07.500]  You want to see it?
[2:50:07.500 --> 2:50:08.500]  Yeah, I'll see it.
[2:50:08.500 --> 2:50:11.060]  Yeah, let's take a look at it because there's a...
[2:50:11.060 --> 2:50:12.060]  What is the guy's name?
[2:50:12.060 --> 2:50:16.500]  Ray Epps, the guy that everyone keeps discussing because there's a guy who is encouraging people
[2:50:16.500 --> 2:50:18.060]  to go into the Capitol.
[2:50:18.060 --> 2:50:25.740]  He was a guy that was in multiple videos and some people thought he was a fed immediately
[2:50:25.740 --> 2:50:33.100]  and other people were listening to him, but this guy was trying to encourage people to
[2:50:33.100 --> 2:50:34.820]  go into the Capitol building.
[2:50:34.820 --> 2:50:37.260]  Here, let's play this just so you can hear Ted Cruz.
[2:50:37.260 --> 2:50:39.620]  I want to turn to the FBI.
[2:50:39.620 --> 2:50:44.620]  Okay, and then McMaster says he knows nothing about it, but in McMaster's case, nothing
[2:50:44.620 --> 2:50:53.700]  against tank commanders, he was never in anything in intelligence, he was a tank commander.
[2:50:53.700 --> 2:50:56.460]  Armored wars with the Soviets.
[2:50:56.460 --> 2:50:58.700]  So he's like, oh, I don't believe in any of that.
[2:50:58.700 --> 2:51:02.780]  I mean, Trump hired some real morons, and we know McMaster was one of the biggest that
[2:51:02.780 --> 2:51:06.740]  totally looked at the Soros folks running, but he's got a problem.
[2:51:06.740 --> 2:51:10.340]  I would have said, hey McMaster, socky says there's such a thing as false flags.
[2:51:10.340 --> 2:51:12.660]  Do you know what a false flag is?
[2:51:12.660 --> 2:51:17.500]  McMaster's so dumb, reportedly drinks about 14 bottles of wine a day, he probably wouldn't
[2:51:17.500 --> 2:51:18.500]  even know.
[2:51:18.500 --> 2:51:19.500]  Let's play socky.
[2:51:19.500 --> 2:51:20.500]  Here she is.
[2:51:20.500 --> 2:51:24.860]  We have information that indicates Russia has already prepositioned a group of operatives
[2:51:24.860 --> 2:51:28.300]  to conduct a false flag operation in Eastern Ukraine.
[2:51:28.300 --> 2:51:32.980]  The operatives are trained in urban warfare and in using explosives to carry out acts
[2:51:32.980 --> 2:51:36.020]  of sabotage against Russia's own proxy forces.
[2:51:36.020 --> 2:51:40.460]  Our information also indicates that Russian influence actors are already starting to fabricate
[2:51:40.460 --> 2:51:45.500]  Ukrainian provocations in state and social media to justify a Russian intervention.
[2:51:45.500 --> 2:51:47.660]  And so divisions in Ukraine.
[2:51:47.660 --> 2:51:49.860]  Olly, this is a big deal.
[2:51:49.860 --> 2:51:54.100]  I tell you, I think McMaster might actually be dumb enough to believe what he was saying.
[2:51:54.100 --> 2:51:55.100]  What do you think?
[2:51:55.100 --> 2:51:59.780]  He might be dumb enough, but let's just note he didn't say no either.
[2:51:59.780 --> 2:52:00.780]  Okay.
[2:52:00.780 --> 2:52:03.380]  He didn't say no either.
[2:52:03.380 --> 2:52:09.740]  And what often happens just so so we're all clear, there are great patriots inside of
[2:52:09.740 --> 2:52:11.300]  our national security state.
[2:52:11.300 --> 2:52:12.980]  Let me say that again.
[2:52:12.980 --> 2:52:21.340]  There are great patriots all across this country that work for the FBI that are in field offices
[2:52:21.340 --> 2:52:29.300]  all across this country and they catch creditors, they stop human trafficking, they find counterfeit
[2:52:29.300 --> 2:52:34.540]  dollars and stuff and work with Secret Service on that and do all kinds of other stuff.
[2:52:34.540 --> 2:52:41.420]  And the DC office asks these field offices to participate in political roundups that
[2:52:41.420 --> 2:52:43.140]  they may not want to do.
[2:52:43.140 --> 2:52:44.140]  Okay.
[2:52:44.140 --> 2:52:50.020]  And that's why it's so important that whistleblowers within our government reach out to counsel
[2:52:50.020 --> 2:52:54.100]  and get themselves legally protected and give truthful information about what was going
[2:52:54.100 --> 2:52:58.420]  on that day and the preparations of that day to those of us who are being targeted by
[2:52:58.420 --> 2:53:00.660]  our governments because it's not just our rights.
[2:53:00.660 --> 2:53:02.220]  It's everybody's rights are up for grabs.
[2:53:02.220 --> 2:53:05.980]  Well, that's right, just a few whistleblowers can bring down this whole corrupt thing, not
[2:53:05.980 --> 2:53:11.060]  to bring down the system, but to bring down the criminal networks that are in the government.
[2:53:11.060 --> 2:53:17.300]  Bring down the satanic overlay of the system of we the people, right?
[2:53:17.300 --> 2:53:20.300]  Because the government is supposed to be made up of the we the people and they're not supposed
[2:53:20.300 --> 2:53:22.380]  to do stuff without our consent.
[2:53:22.380 --> 2:53:26.100]  What we see from the vaccine to the election, it's all without our consent.
[2:53:26.100 --> 2:53:27.820]  We are being raped out.
[2:53:27.820 --> 2:53:28.820]  We're being raped.
[2:53:28.820 --> 2:53:36.700]  We're being gang raped by a global gang, you know, Cabal, and I don't appreciate it.
[2:53:36.700 --> 2:53:41.620]  So what I want to say, though, is that what often happens is, yes, the FBI monitors extremist
[2:53:41.620 --> 2:53:42.620]  groups.
[2:53:42.620 --> 2:53:43.620]  I support that.
[2:53:43.620 --> 2:53:49.220]  But then the FBI infiltrates said extremist groups and when the extremist groups aren't
[2:53:49.220 --> 2:53:55.980]  extreme enough and the FBI is already has sunk costs, what often happens is moral hazard.
[2:53:55.980 --> 2:54:00.460]  Well, that's a great example of what we saw months before January 6 in Michigan with Whitmer.
[2:54:00.460 --> 2:54:06.740]  That was FBI informants literally leading the group of dummies into that.
[2:54:06.740 --> 2:54:08.740]  And that's all come out.
[2:54:08.740 --> 2:54:09.740]  And the Bundy Ranch.
[2:54:09.740 --> 2:54:14.260]  And so what often happens is that is that actually when it's not an FBI agent and it's
[2:54:14.260 --> 2:54:18.780]  an FBI informant, they're basically lawless.
[2:54:18.780 --> 2:54:21.620]  And then they incentivize because they want to get paid by the FBI.
[2:54:21.620 --> 2:54:27.980]  So what Henry McMaster doesn't want the public to research is, is how do how do these systems
[2:54:27.980 --> 2:54:30.820]  actually incentivize corrupt behavior?
[2:54:30.820 --> 2:54:32.500]  And that's what went on January 6.
[2:54:32.500 --> 2:54:34.380]  I know that for a fact now, Alex.
[2:54:34.380 --> 2:54:36.020]  I know it wasn't a theory now.
[2:54:36.020 --> 2:54:37.500]  I know it for a fact.
[2:54:37.500 --> 2:54:41.620]  I've got a name and I know that you're doing some investigations too.
[2:54:41.620 --> 2:54:44.340]  And you know, my counsel will be talking to your counsel soon about that.
[2:54:44.340 --> 2:54:49.140]  But like, you know, this is, this is, I'm going to go ahead and cut this is bullshit.
[2:54:49.140 --> 2:54:50.140]  This is bullshit.
[2:54:50.140 --> 2:54:51.140]  Okay.
[2:54:51.140 --> 2:54:57.860]  And that you and I were being set up to walk into a firing squad, violates my civil rights
[2:54:57.860 --> 2:55:03.740]  as a black man, as an American man, it violates your civil rights as a free speech advocate
[2:55:03.740 --> 2:55:08.460]  as a first amendment activist, as a publisher, a news publisher.
[2:55:08.460 --> 2:55:12.900]  You know, the government is going to need to not just neutralize its opinion.
[2:55:12.900 --> 2:55:13.900]  We are owed an apology.
[2:55:13.900 --> 2:55:14.900]  Okay.
[2:55:14.900 --> 2:55:15.900]  From the federal government.
[2:55:15.900 --> 2:55:16.900]  That's right.
[2:55:16.900 --> 2:55:18.940]  The deep state was mad that we got a million people there to show that Biden didn't have
[2:55:18.940 --> 2:55:21.140]  support and had a legal march.
[2:55:21.140 --> 2:55:26.100]  So they provocateur, they stood down, knowing crazies would be there and a mix of crazies
[2:55:26.100 --> 2:55:31.660]  and provocateurs, then attack the capital of a maximum 500 people that were actually
[2:55:31.660 --> 2:55:33.860]  doing bad stuff out of a million.
[2:55:33.860 --> 2:55:37.980]  And then they use that to demonize us all and announce that the CIA is going to have
[2:55:37.980 --> 2:55:41.660]  domestic offices and that the main missions crushing Trump supporters.
[2:55:41.660 --> 2:55:46.820]  And that's just redid talk about biting off more than they can chew.
[2:55:46.820 --> 2:55:48.220]  They bit off more than they can chew.
[2:55:48.220 --> 2:55:50.100]  They need the consent of the people.
[2:55:50.100 --> 2:55:56.500]  And I refuse to be a premise or the preamble for Patriot Act 2.0.
[2:55:56.500 --> 2:55:57.500]  I refuse.
[2:55:57.500 --> 2:55:58.500]  I will not go.
[2:55:58.500 --> 2:56:00.900]  I'm, I'm applauding the work of Tucker Carlson.
[2:56:00.900 --> 2:56:02.780]  I'm applauding the work of Julie Kelly.
[2:56:02.780 --> 2:56:04.380]  I'm applauding the work of Darren Beatty.
[2:56:04.380 --> 2:56:08.540]  I don't agree with everything that they've included, but certainly where there's smoke,
[2:56:08.540 --> 2:56:13.460]  there's fire and they can't stop info wars from investigating Alex.
[2:56:13.460 --> 2:56:14.900]  Your show is great.
[2:56:14.900 --> 2:56:19.740]  But the folks that are also writing articles at info wars.com are, are so essential.
[2:56:19.740 --> 2:56:23.460]  I think the other talk show house and all the reports, oh, it's, it's amazing stuff.
[2:56:23.460 --> 2:56:24.860]  It's such a precious place.
[2:56:24.860 --> 2:56:25.860]  All right.
[2:56:25.860 --> 2:56:26.860]  Ali Alexander.
[2:56:26.860 --> 2:56:27.860]  Thank you so much.
[2:56:27.860 --> 2:56:28.860]  Where do people find you?
[2:56:28.860 --> 2:56:30.540]  I know you've been purged from the internet like us.
[2:56:30.540 --> 2:56:32.540]  Where do folks find your posts and things?
[2:56:32.540 --> 2:56:33.540]  Yeah.
[2:56:33.540 --> 2:56:35.980]  So gifts and go.com slash Ali Alexander.
[2:56:35.980 --> 2:56:38.940]  That's to help out the legal defense fund where we're suing it to Pelosi.
[2:56:38.940 --> 2:56:42.900]  I'm also under telegram under the same name, Ali Alexander.
[2:56:42.900 --> 2:56:44.980]  I'm on Gitter, Ali Alexander.
[2:56:44.980 --> 2:56:45.980]  I like gab.
[2:56:45.980 --> 2:56:47.500]  It's, you know, free speech platform.
[2:56:47.500 --> 2:56:50.420]  I'm just Ali, which is what I used to be on Twitter.
[2:56:50.420 --> 2:56:51.420]  Everybody knew me.
[2:56:51.420 --> 2:56:58.340]  250,000 people knew me as just Ali on Twitter, but I'm that on gab and I'm also Ali on parlor.
[2:56:58.340 --> 2:57:00.420]  So I think we're out of time.
[2:57:00.420 --> 2:57:01.420]  Thank you.
[2:57:01.420 --> 2:57:02.420]  We'll talk soon.
[2:57:02.420 --> 2:57:03.420]  All right.
[2:57:03.420 --> 2:57:04.420]  Jay Dyer is actually doing today, right?
[2:57:04.420 --> 2:57:05.420]  Cause Paul's moving to Friday.
[2:57:05.420 --> 2:57:06.420]  All right.
[2:57:06.420 --> 2:57:07.420]  Jay Dyer.
[2:57:07.420 --> 2:57:08.420]  Thank you, Ali.
[2:57:08.420 --> 2:57:09.420]  Jay Dyer is about to take over.
[2:57:09.420 --> 2:57:10.420]  I got a few final things.
[2:57:10.420 --> 2:57:11.420]  I want to hit here in this little short five minutes.
[2:57:11.420 --> 2:57:12.420]  It's coming up.
[2:57:12.420 --> 2:57:16.180]  So please don't forget the vitamin mineral fusion has had to go off sales.
[2:57:16.180 --> 2:57:21.180]  It's basically sold out, but X2 is still 50% off the deep breath crystal iodine.
[2:57:21.180 --> 2:57:25.620]  You need to experience it yourself electrochemically, everything in your cells, your immune system
[2:57:25.620 --> 2:57:26.620]  is a thing.
[2:57:26.620 --> 2:57:31.700]  Adults, children, everybody needs it infowarstore.com and it keeps us on the air and a bunch of new
[2:57:31.700 --> 2:57:36.660]  sales will launch tomorrow, but the New Year's sale ends today and some of the stuff's already
[2:57:36.660 --> 2:57:37.660]  sold out.
[2:57:37.660 --> 2:57:41.140]  So it's been taken off the list, but ultimate bone broth, ultimate liquid turmeric and so
[2:57:41.140 --> 2:57:49.300]  much more massively discounted.
[2:57:49.300 --> 2:57:52.860]  Inside you, like me, fire is burning.
[2:57:52.860 --> 2:57:53.860]  Something needs to change.
[2:57:53.860 --> 2:57:58.180]  I just want to reach out and give a recommendation to Reset Wars.
[2:57:58.180 --> 2:57:59.180]  It's really powerful.
[2:57:59.180 --> 2:58:03.980]  Reset Wars was absolutely amazing and eye-opening and revolutionary.
[2:58:03.980 --> 2:58:09.740]  If you want to change your life for the better, I highly recommend this to Alex.
[2:58:09.740 --> 2:58:11.740]  Thank you very much for putting the course together.
[2:58:11.740 --> 2:58:13.820]  I found it to be awesome.
[2:58:13.820 --> 2:58:15.140]  It was worth it to me.
[2:58:15.140 --> 2:58:21.220]  You have taken ancient wisdom and ancient knowledge and crystallized it with scientific
[2:58:21.220 --> 2:58:22.220]  craft.
[2:58:22.220 --> 2:58:23.220]  This isn't about Alex Jones.
[2:58:23.220 --> 2:58:30.020]  So what you're about to see is a lengthy, powerful, well-documented spectrum of information,
[2:58:30.020 --> 2:58:34.980]  experiences and understanding that the power structure is censoring and is definitely
[2:58:34.980 --> 2:58:35.980]  afraid of.
[2:58:35.980 --> 2:58:38.900]  To think the way we are intended to think by God.
[2:58:38.900 --> 2:58:40.820]  That's what this series is about.
[2:58:40.820 --> 2:58:45.900]  Reset Wars has been a great tool during this time of uncertainty and it has rejuvenated
[2:58:45.900 --> 2:58:47.580]  my hope.
[2:58:47.580 --> 2:58:51.500]  It's been helping me a lot with a lot that's going on in my life.
[2:58:51.500 --> 2:58:55.420]  Everybody needs to purchase this product and watch it and then share the information far
[2:58:55.420 --> 2:58:56.420]  and wide.
[2:58:56.420 --> 2:58:58.420]  There is an awakening.
[2:58:58.420 --> 2:59:02.620]  Join in to help yourself and others to wake up.
[2:59:02.620 --> 2:59:08.740]  Reset Wars has been a great tool in both recapping what I've come to already know and also
[2:59:08.740 --> 2:59:09.740]  learn new material.
[2:59:09.740 --> 2:59:10.740]  I'm not disappointed.
[2:59:10.740 --> 2:59:13.540]  I plan on sharing it with as many people as possible.
[2:59:13.540 --> 2:59:17.380]  I hear you coming more and more with that and I feel it more and more.
[2:59:17.380 --> 2:59:18.380]  It's moving me.
[2:59:18.380 --> 2:59:22.820]  We need to have courage and focus in order to accomplish that mission and I felt like
[2:59:22.820 --> 2:59:25.380]  I got a lot of that from Reset Wars as well.
[2:59:25.380 --> 2:59:29.660]  The confidence and hope gained from Reset Wars is priceless.
[2:59:29.660 --> 2:59:31.020]  This isn't magic.
[2:59:31.020 --> 2:59:38.660]  This is the real code of the universe or what Max Plank 120 plus years ago called The Matrix.
[2:59:38.660 --> 2:59:49.340]  Start your journey to true freedom now at ResetWars.com.
[2:59:49.340 --> 2:59:58.980]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:59:58.980 --> 3:00:10.180]  Well, I started the broadcast today talking about how Russia and China have broken with
[3:00:10.180 --> 3:00:14.300]  the globalists and said, we are not going to depopulate our people.
[3:00:14.300 --> 3:00:15.580]  We're not going along with the Great Reset.
[3:00:15.580 --> 3:00:19.420]  We can put that headline back on the screen if we can.
[3:00:19.420 --> 3:00:24.540]  And I didn't know that right as we were going live and posting that, Elon Musk had also
[3:00:24.540 --> 3:00:26.660]  put out a tweet.
[3:00:26.660 --> 3:00:30.620]  We should be much more worried about population collapse.
[3:00:30.620 --> 3:00:32.260]  Let me explain.
[3:00:32.260 --> 3:00:35.740]  Prager University about a decade ago did the best little video four minute, we don't
[3:00:35.740 --> 3:00:39.980]  have that Prager University on, let me eight years ago, Prager University on population
[3:00:39.980 --> 3:00:40.980]  collapse.
[3:00:40.980 --> 3:00:56.020]  But if you've got a father and a mother, okay, and they only have on average 1.3 children
[3:00:56.020 --> 3:01:02.900]  in the Western world, the way civilization set up and all the actuaries, you get a collapse.
[3:01:02.900 --> 3:01:12.620]  You need 2.1 or 2.2, depending on the study, just to keep civilization going.
[3:01:12.620 --> 3:01:16.980]  They need to have 2.1 children, people go, well, how do you have 2.1?
[3:01:16.980 --> 3:01:19.660]  That's on average out of the mass of millions of people.
[3:01:19.660 --> 3:01:25.340]  Or say 350 million America, they've got to have 2.1, 2.2 children to not have society
[3:01:25.340 --> 3:01:26.340]  collapse.
[3:01:26.340 --> 3:01:31.140]  But instead, we have COVID-19 and the death panels, and we just, what do we do?
[3:01:31.140 --> 3:01:37.300]  We just euthanize them at retirement age.
[3:01:37.300 --> 3:01:42.500]  And then we also just have robots take over because we don't have enough people in population
[3:01:42.500 --> 3:01:46.460]  to continue with the infrastructure, plus the humans aren't being trained how to work
[3:01:46.460 --> 3:01:49.580]  things or build things or grow things anymore.
[3:01:49.580 --> 3:01:54.180]  And so we're being made obsolete through the educational system, which the Carnegie and
[3:01:54.180 --> 3:01:59.260]  Rockefeller endowments said is and was their plan.
[3:01:59.260 --> 3:02:02.980]  So that's really where we are, and that's why everything that's done, I call it alien,
[3:02:02.980 --> 3:02:08.180]  I don't know if aliens are on it, I'm just saying everything is done to hurt our genetics,
[3:02:08.180 --> 3:02:13.340]  to hurt our bodies, to hurt our minds, to hurt our intellects, I mean, look at this article,
[3:02:13.340 --> 3:02:16.900]  I should have led the show with this because it's such, in fact, I will tomorrow, unless
[3:02:16.900 --> 3:02:22.820]  there's a war started or something, but not to stay Newsweek or Newsmax articles all over
[3:02:22.820 --> 3:02:30.060]  the news, major U.S. Airlines CEOs warn 5G could ground some planes wreak havoc.
[3:02:30.060 --> 3:02:34.060]  5G is so powerful, it just knocks off all the gauges.
[3:02:34.060 --> 3:02:39.220]  And see those gauges, they pick up that powerful beam, and they say on landing, they've already
[3:02:39.220 --> 3:02:42.020]  studied it.
[3:02:42.020 --> 3:02:45.540]  It's so strong that it'll just black out the planes when they're at 3,000, 4,000 feet
[3:02:45.540 --> 3:02:48.260]  coming in.
[3:02:48.260 --> 3:02:51.500]  And the answer of the system is, so what?
[3:02:51.500 --> 3:02:56.220]  So even though it's going to crash the planes and shut down society, the system doesn't
[3:02:56.220 --> 3:02:59.580]  care because it's a weapon.
[3:02:59.580 --> 3:03:04.180]  And they can turn up the 5G and totally block the transmissions, and totally block the planes.
[3:03:04.180 --> 3:03:07.900]  And the 5G, you can't stick, your eyeball isn't designed to see it, but it's the most
[3:03:07.900 --> 3:03:12.780]  powerful transmitters on Earth, doesn't go too far, but where it goes, it blocks out
[3:03:12.780 --> 3:03:13.780]  everything.
[3:03:13.780 --> 3:03:19.100]  So you've got avionics, and you've got other radar and systems trying to send out and get
[3:03:19.100 --> 3:03:30.100]  data back, but the 5G bathes the aircraft in so much radiation that it's a jammer.
[3:03:30.100 --> 3:03:33.660]  But remember, you complain about 5G, oh, you're a cook, it's no problem.
[3:03:33.660 --> 3:03:38.340]  Even though four years ago, Wired Magazine said, major study, 5G causes cancer, but you
[3:03:38.340 --> 3:03:41.980]  don't see them reporting that now because the 5G companies come in and just buy things
[3:03:41.980 --> 3:03:42.980]  up.
[3:03:42.980 --> 3:03:43.980]  This is a post-human world.
[3:03:43.980 --> 3:03:47.700]  They're putting all these different systems into KELUS, and because we're being killed
[3:03:47.700 --> 3:03:51.700]  by so many different things at the same time, it's hard to go put your finger on what did
[3:03:51.700 --> 3:03:54.140]  it, and that's called a cocktail system.
[3:03:54.140 --> 3:03:57.340]  It's a beyond-the-binary weapon where they give you one poison and they take you with
[3:03:57.340 --> 3:03:59.180]  another later.
[3:03:59.180 --> 3:04:06.180]  And where my knowledge ends is, is past the documents and research, but as someone that
[3:04:06.180 --> 3:04:11.980]  can easily put two plus two together, it's not a human force running this rodeo.
[3:04:11.980 --> 3:04:16.300]  And there are people that comply with it because then they can conform to the matrix
[3:04:16.300 --> 3:04:18.420]  of it, but they're just pretending.
[3:04:18.420 --> 3:04:22.220]  I mean, Klaus Schwab sitting around with the James Bond villain and pretending like
[3:04:22.220 --> 3:04:24.420]  he runs everything is a joke.
[3:04:24.420 --> 3:04:29.260]  All right, J. Dyer is a great author and researcher and expert on the New World Order, always
[3:04:29.260 --> 3:04:30.260]  informative.

[3:06:06.900 --> 3:06:08.420]  Welcome back to The Oxygen Show.
[3:06:08.420 --> 3:06:10.900]  I'm your guest host, J. Dyer of Jays Analysis.
[3:06:10.900 --> 3:06:17.140]  Today I'm going to be covering a text, as you know, that is one of the global elite
[3:06:17.140 --> 3:06:18.140]  texts.
[3:06:18.140 --> 3:06:24.420]  We always cover in this final hour some key document that is 100% absolute proof of everything
[3:06:24.420 --> 3:06:30.500]  that you hear on this network on a routine basis, and we do that because it's not just
[3:06:30.500 --> 3:06:35.500]  something that we try to prove to people, it's also something that helps us understand
[3:06:35.500 --> 3:06:41.280]  how long these plans have been in the work and exactly how intricate and detailed this
[3:06:41.280 --> 3:06:49.500]  plan for a global technocratic government is, which is now coming into play.
[3:06:49.500 --> 3:06:55.340]  I want to look at the 1940 book, which is not very long, it's a relatively short book,
[3:06:55.340 --> 3:06:59.180]  but it's put out by one of the most famous authors of all time.
[3:06:59.180 --> 3:07:03.660]  You've probably not heard of this book, although I guarantee you you've heard of most of his
[3:07:03.660 --> 3:07:05.260]  other texts.
[3:07:05.260 --> 3:07:09.860]  That is the book, The New World Order, by H. G. Wells.
[3:07:09.860 --> 3:07:15.660]  You don't know, of course, H. G. Wells is one of the most famous propagandists in history.
[3:07:15.660 --> 3:07:18.420]  Wells was a war propagandist.
[3:07:18.420 --> 3:07:23.780]  He drew up posters for World War I, and he basically provided all kinds of propaganda
[3:07:23.780 --> 3:07:30.780]  to the Royal Society in his day for the British imperial, his British imperial masters to
[3:07:30.780 --> 3:07:34.060]  run their imperial propaganda.
[3:07:34.060 --> 3:07:38.260]  And so he was kind of the father of this, even before somebody like Bernays, really.
[3:07:38.260 --> 3:07:43.340]  It was in the modern world, it was really H. G. Wells that pioneered propaganda, and
[3:07:43.340 --> 3:07:49.820]  I think you guys know what he did most famously with science fiction.
[3:07:49.820 --> 3:07:53.540]  And so everybody has probably seen War of the Worlds, you might have even read it.
[3:07:53.540 --> 3:07:58.780]  You've probably heard of his books, The Time Machine, The Island of Dr. Moreau, War in
[3:07:58.780 --> 3:08:04.460]  the Air, Shape of Things to Come, which predicted World War II, for example.
[3:08:04.460 --> 3:08:08.660]  It was only a couple of years off, which shows, by the way, that World War II was planned.
[3:08:08.660 --> 3:08:14.860]  But the point is that what we have with H. G. Wells is somebody who was amazingly candid
[3:08:14.860 --> 3:08:19.740]  in his nonfiction, and also a master propagandist in his fiction.
[3:08:19.740 --> 3:08:22.500]  And I don't think that H. G. Wells was a good guy.
[3:08:22.500 --> 3:08:28.420]  H. G. Wells was a high-level Freemason, an avowed Marxist, and a man who wanted to in
[3:08:28.420 --> 3:08:34.780]  his own words completely end the family and to bring in a global socialist technocratic
[3:08:34.780 --> 3:08:35.780]  world order.
[3:08:35.780 --> 3:08:39.660]  But one thing that's interesting about H. G. Wells is that he wasn't strictly speaking
[3:08:39.660 --> 3:08:41.740]  your average kind of Marxist.
[3:08:41.740 --> 3:08:47.020]  He didn't believe that classical Marxism would be the means by which the technocratic
[3:08:47.020 --> 3:08:49.780]  global order would come into reality.
[3:08:49.780 --> 3:08:57.300]  Wells believed that it would require the infrastructure and engine and power of monopoly capitalism
[3:08:57.300 --> 3:08:59.660]  that would build the infrastructure.
[3:08:59.660 --> 3:09:03.820]  And then the technocratic corporate elite would use that infrastructure that was built
[3:09:03.820 --> 3:09:10.020]  by global capitalism, monopoly capitalism, to hijack it and then make it the technocratic
[3:09:10.020 --> 3:09:11.100]  top-down order.
[3:09:11.100 --> 3:09:15.940]  So it would be run by a technocratic scientific elite, and then everything else would be a
[3:09:15.940 --> 3:09:22.820]  top-down collectivism with the people on the top basically immune to any of the laws and
[3:09:22.820 --> 3:09:25.220]  rules underneath it.
[3:09:25.220 --> 3:09:29.460]  And so in the truest sense, you could say that H. G. Wells was an aluminist.
[3:09:29.460 --> 3:09:35.660]  He really did believe in the Illuminati plan in the truest sense of a communistic, socialistic
[3:09:35.660 --> 3:09:40.060]  technocratic order that was not anti-racist or anti-capitalist.
[3:09:40.060 --> 3:09:44.020]  You might say, but every Marxist is anti-capitalist, isn't he?
[3:09:44.020 --> 3:09:45.020]  Actually that's not the case.
[3:09:45.020 --> 3:09:49.940]  Do you know that Marx himself did not believe that capitalism was inherently evil?
[3:09:49.940 --> 3:09:58.020]  He thought it was a necessary stage on the phase of world history to the final utopia.
[3:09:58.020 --> 3:10:00.780]  Marx's end goal of history is actually libertarian.
[3:10:00.780 --> 3:10:06.380]  He believes that the state will wither away, and then you will have this basically scientific,
[3:10:06.380 --> 3:10:13.980]  you know, utopian world, this Star Trek world run by computers and technocratic elite.
[3:10:13.980 --> 3:10:18.580]  And H. G. Wells had the exact same vision because in my view, really, the British Empire
[3:10:18.580 --> 3:10:24.500]  was kind of headed by these forward-seeking, forward-thinking technocrats, and so the British
[3:10:24.500 --> 3:10:31.260]  Empire had a big role in fostering both socialism, communism, democracy, fascism, all of these
[3:10:31.260 --> 3:10:35.740]  different 20th century systems that played into those wars.
[3:10:35.740 --> 3:10:40.020]  You can read Royal Society thinkers that talk about all those systems as experiments.
[3:10:40.020 --> 3:10:45.580]  Bertrand Russell calls Bolshevism a grand, amazing experiment.
[3:10:45.580 --> 3:10:47.860]  Initially early on, he said, Stalin is a great thing.
[3:10:47.860 --> 3:10:49.140]  This is great to have Stalinism.
[3:10:49.140 --> 3:10:52.020]  We need this top-down technocratic control.
[3:10:52.020 --> 3:10:56.980]  And really, what we find in H. G. Wells is the same type of language and the same type
[3:10:56.980 --> 3:10:57.980]  of approbation.
[3:10:57.980 --> 3:11:01.220]  Now, they might have disagreed with certain elements of national socialism, they might
[3:11:01.220 --> 3:11:07.140]  have disagreed with certain elements of Stalinism and critical theory Marxism and so forth.
[3:11:07.140 --> 3:11:11.660]  But ultimately, remember, the end game of every New World Order proponent, and that's
[3:11:11.660 --> 3:11:16.980]  the title of this book, The New World Order, that's where it comes from, written in 1940.
[3:11:16.980 --> 3:11:18.860]  And this is not his first book.
[3:11:18.860 --> 3:11:25.020]  He had another book that he wrote very similar to this many years earlier in 1928 called The
[3:11:25.020 --> 3:11:27.380]  Open Conspiracy.
[3:11:27.380 --> 3:11:30.420]  What are we to do with our lives now that we are in the technocratic age?
[3:11:30.420 --> 3:11:35.340]  But I wanted to go to this one because it's just so obvious that this is an open admission
[3:11:35.340 --> 3:11:42.340]  of international technocratic elites bringing in a global government.
[3:11:42.340 --> 3:11:46.940]  H. G. Wells begins the book by saying that when we look at World War II, when we look
[3:11:46.940 --> 3:11:51.420]  at what the national socialists are up to, and this was written right in 1940, so this
[3:11:51.420 --> 3:11:56.540]  is prior to World War II, he says that it's really not a problem in terms of top-down
[3:11:56.540 --> 3:11:57.940]  control systems.
[3:11:57.940 --> 3:12:02.460]  He says if we think about a dictator like Hitler, he says it's not Hitler himself that is the
[3:12:02.460 --> 3:12:09.340]  problem, it is the nation-state firewalls to global governments and individuals that
[3:12:09.340 --> 3:12:10.340]  are the problem.
[3:12:10.340 --> 3:12:15.300]  And so H. G. Wells was very much a proponent of the idea that there is no individual right.
[3:12:15.300 --> 3:12:21.940]  You don't have a right as an individual unless it is given to you, it is doled out to you
[3:12:21.940 --> 3:12:23.940]  by the state.
[3:12:23.940 --> 3:12:26.940]  So he did not believe, obviously, as a kind of an atheist.
[3:12:26.940 --> 3:12:30.820]  I wouldn't say he was an outright atheist because he has another lesser-known book
[3:12:30.820 --> 3:12:36.660]  about religion that he speaks of God, the Invisible King, whom he says is a Luciferian
[3:12:36.660 --> 3:12:37.660]  type of character.
[3:12:37.660 --> 3:12:41.320]  He believes in a Luciferian God, literally, that's what he says in the book.
[3:12:41.320 --> 3:12:45.740]  So I think he was a Luciferian, and in his sense, he either believed in an absolute satanic
[3:12:45.740 --> 3:12:46.740]  view of Lucifer.
[3:12:46.740 --> 3:12:51.900]  I mean, I ultimately think Lucifer is a satanic thing, but H. G. Wells would say, well, he
[3:12:51.900 --> 3:12:57.940]  would probably say, oh, it just represents science and Promethean man overthrowing any
[3:12:57.940 --> 3:13:01.740]  kind of God or tyranny outside of his own mind.
[3:13:01.740 --> 3:13:06.220]  And then he goes on to say that, really, the reason the world is in crisis, the global
[3:13:06.220 --> 3:13:10.100]  elite writers always talk about the crisis, and the reason that we're going into this
[3:13:10.100 --> 3:13:16.060]  global war at this time, which is right before World War II, is that we still have nation
[3:13:16.060 --> 3:13:17.820]  states and we still have individual rights.
[3:13:17.820 --> 3:13:22.980]  So he's pinning the blame for World War II and World War I on the idea of there being
[3:13:22.980 --> 3:13:29.300]  nations, of there being firewalls and protective structures against global government on the
[3:13:29.300 --> 3:13:34.420]  liberties of individuals, the liberties and rights of people themselves directly from
[3:13:34.420 --> 3:13:36.780]  God.
[3:13:36.780 --> 3:13:41.620]  He says it's time to have a debate because a new age is coming in as a result of the
[3:13:41.620 --> 3:13:43.740]  crises of the global wars.
[3:13:43.740 --> 3:13:48.340]  And remember when we read through Dr. Carol Quigley's massive tome, Tragene Hope, 1,300
[3:13:48.340 --> 3:13:53.300]  pages I've lectured through and eight lectures the entire work, we saw that Quigley admits
[3:13:53.300 --> 3:13:58.900]  as an apologist of this system, as a defender of the system, that the two world wars and
[3:13:58.900 --> 3:14:04.540]  the Cold War of the last century were essentially engineered by the power elite, the Anglo-American
[3:14:04.540 --> 3:14:09.780]  establishment, he calls it, to bring in the world government, literally.
[3:14:09.780 --> 3:14:13.860]  It was planned out, it was strategized, and a lot of people think that, it's just hard
[3:14:13.860 --> 3:14:14.860]  to believe that.
[3:14:14.860 --> 3:14:18.980]  I can't believe that this is planned out 100, 200 years ago, it's just hard for me
[3:14:18.980 --> 3:14:19.980]  to believe.
[3:14:19.980 --> 3:14:25.140]  Well, that's why we're looking back at these books from 1940, from 1928, right, to see
[3:14:25.140 --> 3:14:32.300]  that what's coming about right now, what you read in Klaus was written in 1928, in 1940
[3:14:32.300 --> 3:14:33.300]  by these people.
[3:14:33.300 --> 3:14:43.820]  This is a perfect continuity of ideology, of praxis between HDOLs and Klaus Schwab.
[3:14:43.820 --> 3:14:46.980]  And I don't even know if Klaus Schwab has read these books, perhaps he's read these
[3:14:46.980 --> 3:14:51.700]  books, but does it even matter if the plan is exactly the same, if they're working for
[3:14:51.700 --> 3:15:00.220]  the same structures that are admittedly for over 100 plus years in the Western publications
[3:15:00.220 --> 3:15:06.980]  and academic journals and whatnot, admitting to this plan to bring in this government.
[3:15:06.980 --> 3:15:11.220]  Now, one of the things you might not have known that Marxist and especially HDOLs pioneered
[3:15:11.220 --> 3:15:15.380]  was the idea of the Green Movement, the idea that humans are the problem, and that we are
[3:15:15.380 --> 3:15:20.980]  wasting the planet and its resources through having too many people, having offspring.
[3:15:20.980 --> 3:15:25.620]  This is something that the Royal Society and the Malthusians, and especially HDOLs, was
[3:15:25.620 --> 3:15:32.980]  a big fan of enacting these mass reductions in population, which we'll look at here in
[3:15:32.980 --> 3:15:33.980]  a minute.
[3:15:33.980 --> 3:15:34.980]  That's what he says right away.
[3:15:34.980 --> 3:15:38.620]  The very first thing that we have to deal with is massive reduction of population.
[3:15:38.620 --> 3:15:43.620]  Now, there you go, you see, and soil and green is made from people.
[3:15:43.620 --> 3:15:49.420]  There is Charlton Heston telling you right there in that HDOLs dystopian type worldview
[3:15:49.420 --> 3:15:52.140]  and all this fiction telling you what's going on.
[3:15:52.140 --> 3:15:55.740]  They'll go anywhere, we'll be right back into a second to work our way.
[3:15:55.740 --> 3:16:00.980]  We've all heard about the pastor and his famous statement from inside a concentration camp
[3:16:00.980 --> 3:16:05.300]  in World War II that when they came for one group, he wasn't part of that group so he
[3:16:05.300 --> 3:16:08.620]  didn't stand up, and then when they came for another group, he wasn't part of that group
[3:16:08.620 --> 3:16:13.620]  so he didn't stand up, and finally, when they came for him, there was nobody else to stand
[3:16:13.620 --> 3:16:14.620]  up.
[3:16:14.620 --> 3:16:17.260]  Well, the Global Social Credit Score that China is putting in that's banning people
[3:16:17.260 --> 3:16:20.980]  to three hours of video games a week, and if you criticize the government, you can never
[3:16:20.980 --> 3:16:22.340]  buy or sell again.
[3:16:22.340 --> 3:16:27.380]  Well, that's being brought here and all over the world under the guise of COVID vaccine
[3:16:27.380 --> 3:16:28.380]  passports.
[3:16:28.380 --> 3:16:29.380]  They even admit it.
[3:16:29.380 --> 3:16:31.620]  Now, there's going to be a carbon tax attached to it.
[3:16:31.620 --> 3:16:35.060]  They're going to track where you go and what you do and decide where you can go and what
[3:16:35.060 --> 3:16:36.060]  you can do.
[3:16:36.060 --> 3:16:37.860]  That's what the lockdowns are about.
[3:16:37.860 --> 3:16:39.780]  You'll accept that, you'll accept anything.
[3:16:39.780 --> 3:16:44.620]  So, again, the left is having fun right now with all the censorship and tyranny pretending
[3:16:44.620 --> 3:16:47.580]  like they're part of the power structure, but they're all going to be targeted by this
[3:16:47.580 --> 3:16:48.580]  nightmare as well.
[3:16:48.580 --> 3:16:52.700]  We need to get back to basic human rights and promote them, or all of us will be enslaved
[3:16:52.700 --> 3:16:56.180]  by this horrible technocracy run by the globalists.
[3:16:56.180 --> 3:16:58.380]  Christmas 2021 is gone.
[3:16:58.380 --> 3:17:03.660]  It's in the rearview mirror, but you can still take advantage of Christmas prices going to

[3:17:59.340 --> 3:18:00.340]  Welcome.
[3:18:00.340 --> 3:18:01.340]  Hello, Alex.
[3:18:01.340 --> 3:18:02.340]  Yes, Malcolm.
[3:18:02.340 --> 3:18:03.340]  All right.
[3:18:03.340 --> 3:18:05.340]  I will make this quick and real short where the other patrons can get on the line.
[3:18:05.340 --> 3:18:10.340]  Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Schreuer.
[3:18:10.340 --> 3:18:15.180]  Superbile Vitality and Brain Force Plus, mix those two together, you're an unstoppable
[3:18:15.180 --> 3:18:16.180]  tank.
[3:18:16.180 --> 3:18:17.580]  Superbile Vitality really, really works.
[3:18:17.580 --> 3:18:23.260]  It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up, and so it
[3:18:23.260 --> 3:18:28.460]  has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions that also work quite well, but just
[3:18:28.460 --> 3:18:29.460]  aren't as strong.
[3:18:29.460 --> 3:18:33.540]  This is like a very fine wine, in fact, each batch is different.
[3:18:33.540 --> 3:18:35.540]  Sometimes it's super strong, sometimes it's just okay.
[3:18:35.540 --> 3:18:39.020]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't strong?
[3:18:39.020 --> 3:18:40.020]  That's just how it is.
[3:18:40.020 --> 3:18:41.020]  That's just how it works.
[3:18:41.020 --> 3:18:46.180]  So it's always good, it's just sometimes it's like super strong, but yeah, if you want
[3:18:46.180 --> 3:18:56.180]  the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[3:18:56.180 --> 3:19:01.020]  Everything we've witnessed in the last few decades has only been the buildup for what
[3:19:01.020 --> 3:19:03.020]  the globalists are doing right now.
[3:19:03.020 --> 3:19:07.260]  This is their big offensive, this is their takeover, and this is the point that they're
[3:19:07.260 --> 3:19:10.140]  very weakest because now they've revealed themselves.
[3:19:10.140 --> 3:19:14.180]  Now they're a world government, they're permanent martial law, their medical tyranny is out
[3:19:14.180 --> 3:19:15.180]  in the open.
[3:19:15.180 --> 3:19:19.700]  Their depopulation agenda has been exposed, but they're using their corporate power and
[3:19:19.700 --> 3:19:23.940]  trillions to go across the planet and shut down people telling the truth.
[3:19:23.940 --> 3:19:27.220]  So listen, Paul Revere's, when you spread the word about the broadcast, when you pray
[3:19:27.220 --> 3:19:31.900]  for the broadcast, you're the tip of the spear, and when you buy products at infowarstore.com,
[3:19:31.900 --> 3:19:32.900]  you keep us on air.
[3:19:32.900 --> 3:19:36.540]  Plus, we've got great products that have been sold out for months that are back in stock,
[3:19:36.540 --> 3:19:40.180]  50% off, X2 and Winter Sun.

[3:19:43.780 --> 3:19:46.940]  two things you do for your body, it's these two products.
[3:19:46.940 --> 3:19:51.580]  They're all back in stock at infowarstore.com, 50% off, and it keeps us on the air.
[3:19:51.580 --> 3:19:56.740]  Only way we fail is if you don't take action.
[3:19:56.740 --> 3:20:12.060]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:20:12.060 --> 3:20:15.380]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, I'm your guest, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[3:20:15.380 --> 3:20:21.700]  We were talking about how HD Wells was the early proponent of the green movement and
[3:20:21.700 --> 3:20:26.620]  how this would be the means by which we could bring in this technocratic global government
[3:20:26.620 --> 3:20:32.220]  that even decades before the club of Rome had put out their book, The First Global Revolution,
[3:20:32.220 --> 3:20:37.980]  HD Wells was writing books saying, as the mouthpiece of the Royal Society and the elite
[3:20:37.980 --> 3:20:43.500]  power, Malthusian power structure of the Anglo-American establishment, that most of the planet would
[3:20:43.500 --> 3:20:44.700]  have to go away.
[3:20:44.700 --> 3:20:48.460]  There's no other way to save the planet than to kill everybody.
[3:20:48.460 --> 3:20:52.020]  He says that we will have to have complete control of biology.
[3:20:52.020 --> 3:20:54.900]  This is what he says on page 24 of the book.
[3:20:54.900 --> 3:21:00.100]  Complete collective control of economic and biological life is absolutely necessary to
[3:21:00.100 --> 3:21:02.900]  bring in this global government.
[3:21:02.900 --> 3:21:07.140]  He says if we don't do that, then what we're going to have is a perpetual war, perpetual
[3:21:07.140 --> 3:21:08.140]  chaos.
[3:21:08.140 --> 3:21:16.620]  In other words, in classic HD Wells, in classic 1984 fashion, in order to save everybody,
[3:21:16.620 --> 3:21:18.540]  we must kill everybody.
[3:21:18.540 --> 3:21:24.620]  Wells says that politics and political federation, as we've known so far in Western civilizations,
[3:21:24.620 --> 3:21:26.220]  are basically worthless.
[3:21:26.220 --> 3:21:34.380]  It will not bring global peace apart from a real profound social revolution.
[3:21:34.380 --> 3:21:39.380]  He says that the communists in Russia, that is the Bolshevik Russian Revolution, were
[3:21:39.380 --> 3:21:40.380]  very much extremist.
[3:21:40.380 --> 3:21:46.620]  But get this, he says that their revolution towards world collectivism was not extreme
[3:21:46.620 --> 3:21:47.620]  enough.
[3:21:47.620 --> 3:21:49.540]  It did not go far enough.
[3:21:49.540 --> 3:21:55.380]  The future final revolution, he says, must go way farther and become much more heroic
[3:21:55.380 --> 3:22:00.020]  in its designs to massively depopulate the world.
[3:22:00.020 --> 3:22:05.140]  He says that it is important to promote class warfare in the next chapter, although class
[3:22:05.140 --> 3:22:10.100]  warfare isn't really the end goal, because ultimately this is going to be the destruction
[3:22:10.100 --> 3:22:16.020]  of the wealth or new wealth to put it into this technocratic system where there is no
[3:22:16.020 --> 3:22:19.140]  upward mobility and no wealth at all.
[3:22:19.140 --> 3:22:27.300]  There will be, says the movement from class hate into a rise of police state, because
[3:22:27.300 --> 3:22:32.900]  the dialectical structure, the tensions that are engineered on the basis of class hate
[3:22:32.900 --> 3:22:33.900]  back in his day.
[3:22:33.900 --> 3:22:39.700]  Now, of course, it's identity politics, racial division, which is fostered by these technocrats
[3:22:39.700 --> 3:22:45.260]  on purpose to actually bring into this police state and ultimately this technocratic state.
[3:22:45.260 --> 3:22:53.700]  He goes on to say that on page 33 that Lenin and Stalin were great revolutionaries.
[3:22:53.700 --> 3:22:58.180]  The work that they did was phenomenal, however, none of these people went far enough.
[3:22:58.180 --> 3:23:04.420]  He says that he got to meet with Lenin back in the day in the 1920s and he said he seemed
[3:23:04.420 --> 3:23:11.300]  very nice and he seemed very pleasant and he, like Bertrand Russell, supports that revolution.
[3:23:11.300 --> 3:23:15.020]  But class warfare is just simply not enough.
[3:23:15.020 --> 3:23:19.900]  A lot of the Marxists, the classical Marxists, the revolutionaries of that day, he says they
[3:23:19.900 --> 3:23:23.420]  totally miss and understand the long-term goal of technocracy.
[3:23:23.420 --> 3:23:29.300]  They totally miss the fact that this is not about you bettering supposedly your paycheck,
[3:23:29.300 --> 3:23:31.500]  right, a revolution of the workers or whatever.
[3:23:31.500 --> 3:23:38.300]  He says this is a revolution that's about technocracy and complete control of biology.
[3:23:38.300 --> 3:23:41.460]  What did Klaus Schwab say, multiple times, we will get inside your body.
[3:23:41.460 --> 3:23:43.940]  We will control and change your biology.
[3:23:43.940 --> 3:23:49.100]  I covered last week the technocratic document, the transhumanist ministry of defense, human
[3:23:49.100 --> 3:23:54.540]  augmentation document, which says synthetic biology will mean the changing of your biology
[3:23:54.540 --> 3:23:56.020]  to make you into a human platform.
[3:23:56.020 --> 3:23:58.580]  You're going to be a walking router, a walking modem.
[3:23:58.580 --> 3:23:59.580]  That's all you are.
[3:23:59.580 --> 3:24:04.620]  You're going to receive the signals of the system and emit the signals of the system.
[3:24:04.620 --> 3:24:06.940]  Wells goes on to say that there's nothing wrong with Stalin.
[3:24:06.940 --> 3:24:12.660]  Stalin's a great guy, he says that really the way to understand the world is to understand
[3:24:12.660 --> 3:24:14.980]  it as a zoo.
[3:24:14.980 --> 3:24:17.980]  The world is like a human zoo.
[3:24:17.980 --> 3:24:22.100]  Nation states these are like different sections of the zoo.
[3:24:22.100 --> 3:24:25.180]  Those nations over here, oh, that's the elephant exhibit, right?
[3:24:25.180 --> 3:24:29.300]  When you keep them in their cages, you keep them in their little animal farm or in their
[3:24:29.300 --> 3:24:33.820]  zoo or in their lab, he says these are all fine analogies for actually understanding
[3:24:33.820 --> 3:24:35.900]  the technocratic view of the world order.
[3:24:35.900 --> 3:24:40.620]  The technocrat looks at the world and says, I am elite and special because I have my lab
[3:24:40.620 --> 3:24:44.820]  code and because I got my magical science juice beakers bubbling behind me and that
[3:24:44.820 --> 3:24:48.700]  makes me great and special because I went to the university and was brainwashed and
[3:24:48.700 --> 3:24:54.060]  I have a actually mid-wit level IQ, so actually I'm part of the elite and because I'm a psychopath
[3:24:54.060 --> 3:24:58.900]  and I want to kill everybody, I'm elite and H.G. Wells says that's who runs the new world
[3:24:58.900 --> 3:25:03.900]  order, scientific technocrats and they view the world like a farm, like a zoo and like
[3:25:03.900 --> 3:25:13.140]  a lab, yeah, exactly, exactly, Mr. Fauci, exactly.
[3:25:13.140 --> 3:25:17.780]  He says that the first thing that we're going to have to do is indoctrinate the youth, interesting.
[3:25:17.780 --> 3:25:22.940]  These technocratic individuals always know to corrupt the youth because they, again,
[3:25:22.940 --> 3:25:28.460]  are themselves essentially control freaks and they know that the best way to do this
[3:25:28.460 --> 3:25:37.420]  is to infect the youth with toxic ideologies, infect them with the idea that population
[3:25:37.420 --> 3:25:42.140]  is itself the problem, don't have kids, don't have offspring, live in your pod, et cetera.
[3:25:42.140 --> 3:25:46.300]  All of that is, we'll set 100 years ago and he even says that we're going to have to divide
[3:25:46.300 --> 3:25:51.300]  people into generations and give them different attitudes to set them off against other generations,
[3:25:51.300 --> 3:25:57.540]  right, millennials, all this kind of stuff, he says that this will lead to the decline
[3:25:57.540 --> 3:25:58.540]  of the West.
[3:25:58.540 --> 3:26:01.140]  Wait a minute, why would the elite want the decline of the West?
[3:26:01.140 --> 3:26:04.540]  Because they don't care about the West, they don't care about prosperity, they don't want
[3:26:04.540 --> 3:26:08.980]  prosperity, I don't understand, people can't understand that there's a class of individuals
[3:26:08.980 --> 3:26:14.060]  at the top, the technocratic elite, that do not want to simply make money, they don't
[3:26:14.060 --> 3:26:15.580]  care about making money.
[3:26:15.580 --> 3:26:20.820]  They have the control of the Fed printing press, they don't need money, they want something
[3:26:20.820 --> 3:26:28.020]  much grander than that, which is control of all life, control of biology.
[3:26:28.020 --> 3:26:29.020]  That's what H.C.
[3:26:29.020 --> 3:26:34.180]  Wells just said in this book, almost 100 years ago, 80 years ago.
[3:26:34.180 --> 3:26:40.540]  Wells says that once we capture the minds of the youth, like the Maoist youth revolutions,
[3:26:40.540 --> 3:26:45.460]  we can just steer the youth as we want and who can fail to see that that is what has
[3:26:45.460 --> 3:26:50.900]  happened at a much more sophisticated scientific level today, that the youth are steered and
[3:26:50.900 --> 3:26:56.580]  controlled into adopting basically the most self-destructive and nihilistic philosophies
[3:26:56.580 --> 3:26:59.180]  and beliefs.
[3:26:59.180 --> 3:27:04.900]  Wells says that whether you look at FDR in the U.S. or whether you look at Stalin in
[3:27:04.900 --> 3:27:09.100]  Russia in that day, he says that the creation of the welfare state, the creation of the
[3:27:09.100 --> 3:27:14.700]  Stalin estate, all of these things, he says, are perfectly in line with what I want to
[3:27:14.700 --> 3:27:16.180]  see as a technocrat.
[3:27:16.180 --> 3:27:20.980]  Now, that doesn't mean everything in those systems went perfectly according to what H.C.
[3:27:20.980 --> 3:27:27.100]  Wells wanted, but he says that these are experiments and models that are perfectly enacting the
[3:27:27.100 --> 3:27:32.180]  kinds of things that I want to see on the way towards the final revolution.
[3:27:32.180 --> 3:27:33.420]  What is the final revolution?
[3:27:33.420 --> 3:27:37.940]  We know that this is talked about in Aldous Huxley's essay, which is the introduction
[3:27:37.940 --> 3:27:40.340]  to Brave New World.
[3:27:40.340 --> 3:27:45.660]  We know that this is talked about in Bertrand Russell's writings.
[3:27:45.660 --> 3:27:51.900]  Well, he says that the real meaning of this is that all of the revolutions of the last
[3:27:51.900 --> 3:27:56.580]  several centuries, we think about the French Revolution, we think about the Republican
[3:27:56.580 --> 3:28:01.420]  and Democratic revolutions of the 1800s that overthrew the monarchies, we think about even
[3:28:01.420 --> 3:28:05.780]  the American Revolution, according to H.C. Wells, even the Bolshevik Revolution.
[3:28:05.780 --> 3:28:11.300]  All the revolutions, he says, are one revolution, now I'm not saying they're literally identical,
[3:28:11.300 --> 3:28:14.660]  but they're one revolution towards the same goal.
[3:28:14.660 --> 3:28:21.460]  And he says that that one goal is the technocratic internationalist global elite world order.
[3:28:21.460 --> 3:28:26.580]  And he says that, again, the Bolsheviks didn't do enough, they didn't kill enough people,
[3:28:26.580 --> 3:28:30.980]  because to bring this in is going to require killing everybody almost, literally.
[3:28:30.980 --> 3:28:34.620]  He says most people are going to have to die.
[3:28:34.620 --> 3:28:38.660]  And all of his compatriots said the same thing, Bertrand Russell says the same thing, Huxley
[3:28:38.660 --> 3:28:43.540]  says the same thing, all the Huxleys, all the brothers, they all said this.
[3:28:43.540 --> 3:28:47.860]  And most people are going to have to die because most people are not fit to go into the scientific
[3:28:47.860 --> 3:28:48.860]  future order.
[3:28:48.860 --> 3:28:53.420]  When we come back, we're going to see what he says is the number one thing in the way,
[3:28:53.420 --> 3:28:55.420]  don't go anywhere, this is in force.
[3:28:55.420 --> 3:29:05.020]  This is from, people say, why is it from Chiapas, Mexico, the communists?
[3:29:05.020 --> 3:29:09.740]  Well that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested above organic
[3:29:09.740 --> 3:29:13.540]  in the volcanic soil, better than Guatemalan coffee, and yeah, we buy it from the little
[3:29:13.540 --> 3:29:17.060]  farmers that, you know, the media calls communists, but really they're just a commune.
[3:29:17.060 --> 3:29:20.100]  And whatever the point is, is that it's good coffee and we've got it.
[3:29:20.100 --> 3:29:23.180]  And the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over, so I actually buy this from the
[3:29:23.180 --> 3:29:26.540]  Mexican rebels and I've been buying it for, what, 14 years and the price has never gone
[3:29:26.540 --> 3:29:27.540]  up.
[3:29:27.540 --> 3:29:31.380]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more, per pound, and I just
[3:29:31.380 --> 3:29:33.540]  think it's some of the best coffee you're going to find anywhere.
[3:29:33.540 --> 3:29:36.860]  It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend from the Chiapas Rebels, literally.
[3:29:36.860 --> 3:29:44.500]  In fact, I'm not going to tell you a little story, yeah, I'd like that, okay, you wouldn't
[3:29:44.500 --> 3:29:45.500]  believe it.
[3:29:45.500 --> 3:29:50.060]  Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com and that's how we fund this operation and if you don't

[3:32:57.020 --> 3:33:14.460]  Making a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:33:14.460 --> 3:33:17.940]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show and your guest is Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis and we
[3:33:17.940 --> 3:33:23.180]  are working our way through the New World Order by H.G. Wells and we were talking about
[3:33:23.180 --> 3:33:28.980]  the technocracy being planned a long time ago and Wells noting that a couple of the
[3:33:28.980 --> 3:33:34.740]  things that we're standing in the way are the notions of liberties, the notion of individual
[3:33:34.740 --> 3:33:41.940]  rights that don't become essentially malleable or created by the state, something that you
[3:33:41.940 --> 3:33:46.820]  have inherently by divine right by being made in the image of God.
[3:33:46.820 --> 3:33:51.540]  Wells says that that needs to go away and he talks about the fact that it doesn't really
[3:33:51.540 --> 3:34:00.540]  matter whether the collectivism that we bring in is something from a Bolshevik socialist
[3:34:00.540 --> 3:34:06.900]  or communist model because ultimately he says these all can give way to the end goal of
[3:34:06.900 --> 3:34:11.180]  technocracy and he says whatever works is really the best system, whatever works to
[3:34:11.180 --> 3:34:14.460]  bring in technocracy, to bring in the top-down control.
[3:34:14.460 --> 3:34:18.780]  So this is why we can begin to see that things like the Cold War, while they were definitely
[3:34:18.780 --> 3:34:24.020]  real on the ground with different Eastern-Western spies and doing all this kind of stuff, people
[3:34:24.020 --> 3:34:29.060]  like H.G. Wells at the top were cheering on the Communist Marxist Revolution.
[3:34:29.060 --> 3:34:35.660]  People who are the most famous proponents of the ideas of the elite Western establishment
[3:34:35.660 --> 3:34:38.340]  have always supported communism and Marxism.
[3:34:38.340 --> 3:34:43.300]  The wealthiest people in the West funded, supported, and fostered communism and Marxism
[3:34:43.300 --> 3:34:48.500]  pretty consistently in the 20th century and so the point is that it doesn't matter whether
[3:34:48.500 --> 3:34:54.560]  it's monopoly capitalism or whether it's socialist Marxism, both of those systems are
[3:34:54.560 --> 3:35:00.980]  atheistic materialistic systems fostered and funded by these people and H.G. Wells is the
[3:35:00.980 --> 3:35:07.300]  mouthpiece of the wealthiest, most powerful people in the West of the 20th century.
[3:35:07.300 --> 3:35:12.540]  And just like David Rockefeller some 50, 60 years later after this, they both can say
[3:35:12.540 --> 3:35:17.260]  I love Marxism, I love socialism, I love technocracy, I love fascism they say.
[3:35:17.260 --> 3:35:26.780]  They don't have a problem with any of those systems because just like Mr. Green in the
[3:35:26.780 --> 3:35:31.100]  James Bond quantum of solace, the villain there, Mr. Green says I don't care whether
[3:35:31.100 --> 3:35:34.500]  you're a nationalist, whether you're a socialist, whether you're a Marxist, whether you're
[3:35:34.500 --> 3:35:40.340]  a communist, as long as you can get things done and bring about my consolidation of power
[3:35:40.340 --> 3:35:41.500]  I support you.
[3:35:41.500 --> 3:35:46.740]  He says we as a secret international specter group will work with any of those people to
[3:35:46.740 --> 3:35:48.620]  achieve our ends.
[3:35:48.620 --> 3:35:53.580]  So Marx goes on to say that the problem that stands in the way of this world government,
[3:35:53.580 --> 3:35:56.420]  this technocratic order is Christianity.
[3:35:56.420 --> 3:35:58.620]  Isn't it funny that they always pick that religion?
[3:35:58.620 --> 3:36:05.740]  Why is that the religion that is the one that is the most problematic for this satanic demonic
[3:36:05.740 --> 3:36:06.740]  system?
[3:36:06.740 --> 3:36:07.740]  And he calls it Luciferian.
[3:36:07.740 --> 3:36:08.900]  Make no joke about it.
[3:36:08.900 --> 3:36:13.340]  In the book, God the Invisible King, which is not the Christian God, it's this other
[3:36:13.340 --> 3:36:19.820]  secret deity that he worships in his lodge, he says that the real deity is Lucifer.
[3:36:19.820 --> 3:36:26.660]  And what's in the way of this progress of killing everybody and bringing in this global
[3:36:26.660 --> 3:36:32.340]  technocratic order is the idea that individuals have rights and we can't just kill everybody.
[3:36:32.340 --> 3:36:37.260]  Then he goes into talking about more things that were kind of applicable to his time like
[3:36:37.260 --> 3:36:42.940]  the New Deal and how the New Deal was part of the Marxist Socialist plan.
[3:36:42.940 --> 3:36:49.060]  He then says that things like the creation of the European Union will be instrumental
[3:36:49.060 --> 3:36:54.900]  to the integration of all the continents into their own continental unions.
[3:36:54.900 --> 3:37:04.180]  And that's just a step on the way to the long goal of the technocratic global federation.
[3:37:04.180 --> 3:37:09.780]  He goes on to say that the bringing into this new world order will be something beyond the
[3:37:09.780 --> 3:37:10.780]  League of Nations.
[3:37:10.780 --> 3:37:15.140]  And he talks about how the League of Nations in his day, this is created as a result of
[3:37:15.140 --> 3:37:18.540]  World War I, he says the League of Nations totally failed because they didn't have the
[3:37:18.540 --> 3:37:23.220]  power to enforce the technocratic global order.
[3:37:23.220 --> 3:37:26.660]  He says that in the future, and this is prior to the creation of the United Nations, he
[3:37:26.660 --> 3:37:29.740]  basically predicts the creation of the United Nations, he says that the next thing that
[3:37:29.740 --> 3:37:36.460]  will come about, hopefully it will be able to create the worldwide collective.
[3:37:36.460 --> 3:37:41.500]  Yeah, that's his words.
[3:37:41.500 --> 3:37:44.780]  He says that we have to bring in collectivism.
[3:37:44.780 --> 3:37:50.660]  He says that the notion of traditional religion, the notion of any of these ideas that don't
[3:37:50.660 --> 3:37:55.580]  bring about the French revolutionary collectivist idea are anathema.
[3:37:55.580 --> 3:37:56.740]  They have to be destroyed.
[3:37:56.740 --> 3:37:58.740]  They are the enemy.
[3:37:58.740 --> 3:38:05.140]  He mentions the French revolutionaries as a model, he says they were the true radicals.
[3:38:05.140 --> 3:38:06.580]  Bolsheviks didn't even go far enough.
[3:38:06.580 --> 3:38:09.420]  The French revolutionaries went far enough, of course they, through the Committee of Public
[3:38:09.420 --> 3:38:14.580]  Safety, would behead tens of thousands of people in the French Revolution.
[3:38:14.580 --> 3:38:20.660]  But hey, that's what you got to do to bring in the new world order and save the planet.
[3:38:20.660 --> 3:38:25.140]  And just trying to understand that this is not some random sci-fi writer.
[3:38:25.140 --> 3:38:27.660]  This is not some fringe lunatic.
[3:38:27.660 --> 3:38:31.860]  This is the most important propaganda so the 20th century.
[3:38:31.860 --> 3:38:34.540]  More important than Edward Bernays.
[3:38:34.540 --> 3:38:40.300]  Everybody in the world, most people in the world have probably heard of some science
[3:38:40.300 --> 3:38:44.260]  fiction novel that H.G. Wells wrote.
[3:38:44.260 --> 3:38:47.020]  And H.G. Wells is so famous and so popular.
[3:38:47.020 --> 3:38:51.620]  He's known as the father of science fiction, him and Jules Verne.
[3:38:51.620 --> 3:38:56.660]  How many people have watched the movie, Spielberg's World of Worlds?
[3:38:56.660 --> 3:39:03.700]  How many people have watched anything to do with sci-fi that you can't escape H.G. Wells?
[3:39:03.700 --> 3:39:07.660]  And what H.G. Wells figured out was that he could condition way more people through
[3:39:07.660 --> 3:39:14.700]  fiction than he could through these boring global fact books, these propaganda books
[3:39:14.700 --> 3:39:16.580]  that were just factual.
[3:39:16.580 --> 3:39:17.660]  Nobody's going to read this.
[3:39:17.660 --> 3:39:22.580]  That's why nobody knows that H.G. Wells wrote this book and you don't read this in college.
[3:39:22.580 --> 3:39:26.220]  When you go to college, nobody reads H.G. Wells' plans.
[3:39:26.220 --> 3:39:28.820]  Nobody reads Carol Quigley.
[3:39:28.820 --> 3:39:32.420]  So when I was doing my graduate work, when I was studying these topics in grad school,
[3:39:32.420 --> 3:39:38.140]  I went to my decent sized university where I went a pretty good graduate school program
[3:39:38.140 --> 3:39:39.340]  for research.
[3:39:39.340 --> 3:39:44.980]  I went into the basement of the library because I was working as a research assistant.
[3:39:44.980 --> 3:39:46.300]  And I was like, you know, I'm curious.
[3:39:46.300 --> 3:39:49.580]  I want to see, because we have a copy of Tragedy and Hope.
[3:39:49.580 --> 3:39:56.340]  I just, it was on the, you know, the database, the card file or whatever.
[3:39:56.340 --> 3:39:58.540]  And so I went down the basement and I found it.
[3:39:58.540 --> 3:40:05.940]  And I noticed that one person, one professor in 20, 30 years since the book had been there
[3:40:05.940 --> 3:40:07.980]  had checked it out.
[3:40:07.980 --> 3:40:13.820]  So the average university setting, they don't know that this is the way the world works.
[3:40:13.820 --> 3:40:17.580]  Even high level university professors, I would talk to my professors about this.
[3:40:17.580 --> 3:40:20.980]  I would bring, I would take Tragedy and Hope to class, I would bring these books up.
[3:40:20.980 --> 3:40:24.260]  I would bring these books into class and bring them up.
[3:40:24.260 --> 3:40:26.420]  They'd never read these things.
[3:40:26.420 --> 3:40:29.980]  So what I'm getting at is that to understand the things that we're talking about today,
[3:40:29.980 --> 3:40:32.340]  I'm not trying to toot my own horn or say that I'm awesome or anything.
[3:40:32.340 --> 3:40:37.580]  I'm just saying that it's, it's a fact that you got to get up to like the Brzezinski
[3:40:37.580 --> 3:40:44.580]  level of people, the Kissinger level, the Jacques Attali level before you meet people
[3:40:44.580 --> 3:40:49.340]  and talk to people who have read this swath of information.
[3:40:49.340 --> 3:40:53.980]  You got to read a Brzezinski because Brzezinski, he writes and talks about these kinds of books.
[3:40:53.980 --> 3:40:58.860]  You know, Brzezinski cites Anthony Sutton in between two ages.
[3:40:58.860 --> 3:41:07.340]  So he was reading these other books and reading these geopolitical tones, but even most professors
[3:41:07.340 --> 3:41:08.340]  don't read this stuff.
[3:41:08.340 --> 3:41:09.340]  They don't know that.
[3:41:09.340 --> 3:41:13.540]  Most professors, just like politicians, are trapped in some low level dialectic of I'm
[3:41:13.540 --> 3:41:15.300]  a liberal, I'm a conservative.
[3:41:15.300 --> 3:41:17.300]  They don't know anything about this stuff.
[3:41:17.300 --> 3:41:19.380]  They don't know what the Royal Society talks about.
[3:41:19.380 --> 3:41:22.460]  They don't know, they haven't read, you might have a philosophy professor.
[3:41:22.460 --> 3:41:24.060]  He's read Bertrand Russell.
[3:41:24.060 --> 3:41:26.300]  Okay, but what did he read from Bertrand Russell?
[3:41:26.300 --> 3:41:27.940]  He read the history of philosophy.
[3:41:27.940 --> 3:41:33.260]  He didn't read Bertrand Russell's scientific outlook, the impact of science on society.
[3:41:33.260 --> 3:41:37.460]  He doesn't know about the history of Malthus in eugenics or any of that stuff.
[3:41:37.460 --> 3:41:41.180]  And I know because I went and argued and debated with all the professors of the university
[3:41:41.180 --> 3:41:42.540]  and none of them knew about this stuff.
[3:41:42.540 --> 3:41:44.620]  Maybe one had heard of this stuff.
[3:41:44.620 --> 3:41:49.180]  So I'm just trying to stress to you that you could go find these books and look and see
[3:41:49.180 --> 3:41:50.180]  yourself.
[3:41:50.180 --> 3:41:52.500]  Even if you don't want to read them, you don't have time, you can go see that these books
[3:41:52.500 --> 3:41:53.980]  exist, they are the case.
[3:41:53.980 --> 3:41:55.100]  I'm not making them up.
[3:41:55.100 --> 3:41:56.100]  They are real.
[3:41:56.100 --> 3:41:57.100]  They do exist, you see.
[3:41:57.100 --> 3:42:02.100]  I didn't just pull this out of my butt, they're real books.
[3:42:02.100 --> 3:42:06.980]  And they show you that they're telling you that this is a hundred-year plan.
[3:42:06.980 --> 3:42:10.140]  So when you deny this stuff or when you don't want to believe this stuff, you don't want
[3:42:10.140 --> 3:42:12.300]  to face reality, it's only hurting you.
[3:42:12.300 --> 3:42:16.380]  It's not hurting, you're not getting back at me, you're not getting back at other people,
[3:42:16.380 --> 3:42:18.380]  the evil anti-vaxxers, all this kind of stuff.
[3:42:18.380 --> 3:42:21.060]  You're not hurting them, it's only hurting you.
[3:42:21.060 --> 3:42:26.340]  And this guy says, you need to die, ninety, ninety-five percent of people need to die
[3:42:26.340 --> 3:42:29.220]  because they're not going to go into the future.
[3:42:29.220 --> 3:42:32.780]  It's a cult, it's a death cult, it really is.
[3:42:32.780 --> 3:42:36.980]  So H.C. Wells goes on to say that Marxism is not good enough.
[3:42:36.980 --> 3:42:38.580]  Marxism is not going to get us there.
[3:42:38.580 --> 3:42:40.980]  All we got to do, and he talks about dumb the Marxists are, right?
[3:42:40.980 --> 3:42:44.420]  So even he understood that your average Marxist, your average professor, they're idiots.
[3:42:44.420 --> 3:42:45.420]  They don't know.
[3:42:45.420 --> 3:42:46.420]  They're unrealistic.
[3:42:46.420 --> 3:42:51.820]  So what's the real plan and why is Marxism not really useful?
[3:42:51.820 --> 3:42:56.380]  We'll find out when we come back.
[3:42:56.380 --> 3:43:01.220]  Everything we've witnessed in the last few decades has only been the build-up for what
[3:43:01.220 --> 3:43:03.220]  the globalists are doing right now.
[3:43:03.220 --> 3:43:06.340]  This is their big offensive, this is their takeover.
[3:43:06.340 --> 3:43:10.340]  And this is the point that they're at their very weakest because now they've revealed themselves.
[3:43:10.340 --> 3:43:14.380]  Now they're a world government, they're permanent martial law, their medical tyranny is out
[3:43:14.380 --> 3:43:15.380]  in the open.
[3:43:15.380 --> 3:43:19.900]  Their depopulation agenda has been exposed, but they're using their corporate power and
[3:43:19.900 --> 3:43:24.140]  trillions to go across the planet and shut down people telling the truth.
[3:43:24.140 --> 3:43:27.420]  So listen, Paul Revere's, when you spread the word about the broadcast, when you pray

[3:43:54.820 --> 3:44:08.460]  William of California, people are asleep and programmed controlled.
[3:44:08.460 --> 3:44:09.460]  I agree.
[3:44:09.460 --> 3:44:10.940]  How do you make the sleeper awaken, William?
[3:44:10.940 --> 3:44:11.940]  Hi, Alex.
[3:44:11.940 --> 3:44:12.940]  Thanks for taking my call.
[3:44:12.940 --> 3:44:13.940]  Can I plug, Alex, real quick?
[3:44:13.940 --> 3:44:14.940]  Yeah, go ahead.
[3:44:14.940 --> 3:44:21.420]  Hey, I'm in my 60s, and I did the work of 25, 30-year-olds, and I worked them into the
[3:44:21.420 --> 3:44:25.820]  ground, and you wanted to know why, and I've tested this, and I've taken your B12, and
[3:44:25.820 --> 3:44:28.700]  let me tell you, when I don't take it, I pay a price.
[3:44:28.700 --> 3:44:29.700]  I really do.
[3:44:29.700 --> 3:44:32.780]  I take that B12, and I am electric, man.
[3:44:32.780 --> 3:44:38.300]  I can run 10 miles, I do some pretty heavy work with a highway department, and my friends
[3:44:38.300 --> 3:44:42.900]  will attest to the fact that, yeah, for a guy in his 60s, and you know, pushing the
[3:44:42.900 --> 3:44:55.940]  70, and I'm not just blowing smoke here, the B12 saves my life.

[3:46:09.060 --> 3:46:12.780]  creating a map and a database of where you go and what you do.

[3:46:56.660 --> 3:47:12.660]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:47:12.660 --> 3:47:13.660]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:47:13.660 --> 3:47:14.660]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer.
[3:47:14.660 --> 3:47:20.660]  Today's analysis, moving through the HG Wells New World Order book, this plan, this propaganda
[3:47:20.660 --> 3:47:28.300]  piece from 1940 about how to instantiate, how to bring about, how to revolutionize the world
[3:47:28.300 --> 3:47:33.500]  as a strategy to create a global technocratic world government.
[3:47:33.500 --> 3:47:38.940]  He says that the youth will have to keep at their praxis of revolution, and he says eventually,
[3:47:38.940 --> 3:47:44.260]  if we keep at this, if we do really well, he says that the USA will be transformed from
[3:47:44.260 --> 3:47:48.900]  what it is presently to a Fabian socialist power.
[3:47:48.900 --> 3:47:54.580]  If you don't know, the Fabian socialist model, of course, is the turtle model of how to bring
[3:47:54.580 --> 3:47:55.580]  in socialism.
[3:47:55.580 --> 3:48:01.620]  Rather than a top-down boot tyranny right away, this is a more subtle technocratic model
[3:48:01.620 --> 3:48:08.580]  of manipulating people through wars, through many, many decades, to accept long-term goals
[3:48:08.580 --> 3:48:11.380]  that people can't accept right away.
[3:48:11.380 --> 3:48:16.900]  What better example than the last two years to see how emergencies, faux emergencies
[3:48:16.900 --> 3:48:22.180]  made up, invented, emerge crises, crisis, crisis, crisis, scares the crap out of everybody
[3:48:22.180 --> 3:48:24.820]  and they go along out of fear.
[3:48:24.820 --> 3:48:29.620]  That's exactly what HG Wells was talking about, except he's saying that it's key to
[3:48:29.620 --> 3:48:35.980]  destroy the United States from within through subversion, not with classical Marxism, but
[3:48:35.980 --> 3:48:44.980]  with gradual implementation of socialist technocratic, get everybody on the dole strategies, liberalism,
[3:48:44.980 --> 3:48:50.700]  atheism, the destruction of the existing order to bring in the new order.
[3:48:50.700 --> 3:48:57.620]  He says that all that's needed to do this is to keep fomenting tension, division, strife,
[3:48:57.620 --> 3:49:05.220]  chaos, attack the traditional structures, get rid of the existing religious ideas of
[3:49:05.220 --> 3:49:12.540]  God and so forth, and even to the point of abolishing notions like the depletion.
[3:49:12.540 --> 3:49:16.820]  You might say, well, he's just a peace-loving pacifist, no, he's not.
[3:49:16.820 --> 3:49:20.940]  This is a guy who says everybody needs to die, do you think that he wants to abolish
[3:49:20.940 --> 3:49:24.220]  the death penalty because he is a peace-loving hippie?
[3:49:24.220 --> 3:49:28.700]  No, he wants to get rid of the death penalty because it's a social engineering warfare
[3:49:28.700 --> 3:49:32.660]  strategy that emaciates a society.
[3:49:32.660 --> 3:49:38.660]  I'm not saying the death penalty isn't abused or that it's not, in some cases, done unfairly
[3:49:38.660 --> 3:49:40.340]  or wrong, of course.
[3:49:40.340 --> 3:49:44.380]  But we don't operate on the basis of the fact that sometimes something is abused that we
[3:49:44.380 --> 3:49:45.380]  get rid of it.
[3:49:45.380 --> 3:49:47.300]  Does sometimes a husband beat his wife?
[3:49:47.300 --> 3:49:48.300]  Sure.
[3:49:48.300 --> 3:49:52.140]  Oh, I guess we need to get rid of all husbands and all fathers because one guy has abused
[3:49:52.140 --> 3:49:53.140]  somebody.
[3:49:53.140 --> 3:49:54.140]  No, that's ridiculous.
[3:49:54.140 --> 3:49:59.060]  That's the inverted, weird, creepo logic of liberalism.
[3:49:59.060 --> 3:50:04.180]  The victim status gets to dictate everything, which is completely irrational, on the basis
[3:50:04.180 --> 3:50:08.220]  of the fact that sometimes there's an abuse, and obviously that doesn't work.
[3:50:08.220 --> 3:50:13.900]  You can't make the anomaly the norm or the abuse the norm because all that does is revolutionize
[3:50:13.900 --> 3:50:17.380]  and destroy the structures of society, and that's a strategy.
[3:50:17.380 --> 3:50:22.860]  So people don't understand that warfare is very sophisticated, especially in the 20th
[3:50:22.860 --> 3:50:29.340]  century, and it extends beyond things like fun with swords and knives and tanks.
[3:50:29.340 --> 3:50:36.620]  Warfare is economic, it's social, it's cultural, it's political, it's linguistic, war on language,
[3:50:36.620 --> 3:50:39.300]  war on truth, war on meaning, war on life.
[3:50:39.300 --> 3:50:46.100]  All these areas, war on biology are part of the world in which we inhabit now where everything
[3:50:46.100 --> 3:50:49.940]  is under the purview of being weaponized and turned into a weapon.
[3:50:49.940 --> 3:50:52.060]  Gender is now weaponized.
[3:50:52.060 --> 3:50:57.900]  Not gender itself, but what they're doing with this made up nonsense, which is all part
[3:50:57.900 --> 3:51:00.460]  of what he says, you see.
[3:51:00.460 --> 3:51:07.500]  It's all part of a strategy, not of Russia, not of some other country, but of the technocratic
[3:51:07.500 --> 3:51:12.780]  elite who want to manipulate just like they did in the World Wars of the last century
[3:51:12.780 --> 3:51:18.340]  and just like they did in the Cold War, a new war between the US and Eurasia.
[3:51:18.340 --> 3:51:20.340]  Have you read 1984?
[3:51:20.340 --> 3:51:26.660]  1984 is all about fake, made up, villains, and manipulated wars that might not even be
[3:51:26.660 --> 3:51:27.660]  real.
[3:51:27.660 --> 3:51:31.220]  Now, I'm not saying there's not a real threat of the global elites bringing about a war
[3:51:31.220 --> 3:51:32.300]  with Russia or China.
[3:51:32.300 --> 3:51:34.220]  They do want that because they're crazy.
[3:51:34.220 --> 3:51:39.900]  They're impelled by a demonic power and force which they're subservient to.
[3:51:39.900 --> 3:51:45.900]  The same force that he talks about that he calls Lucifer.
[3:51:45.900 --> 3:51:51.500]  H.J. Wells goes on to say that the goal is internationalism, and internationalism requires
[3:51:51.500 --> 3:51:55.540]  a revolution in three key areas, three key areas.
[3:51:55.540 --> 3:52:01.980]  One of those is the social realm to promote the eradication of the idea of an individual
[3:52:01.980 --> 3:52:08.500]  or the individual having meaning, the individual having any power on his own.
[3:52:08.500 --> 3:52:11.740]  Disempower and atomize, he says.
[3:52:11.740 --> 3:52:15.060]  There's socialization.
[3:52:15.060 --> 3:52:18.980]  He says that another key area, this is back in, again, in the 40s, so not everything then
[3:52:18.980 --> 3:52:23.660]  is relevant now, but you can see that what he talked about then was actually pretty successful
[3:52:23.660 --> 3:52:25.780]  in the succeeding decades.
[3:52:25.780 --> 3:52:29.940]  He says that the number two area would have to be law, revolutionized law, the notion
[3:52:29.940 --> 3:52:32.940]  of rights, common law, all this kind of stuff.
[3:52:32.940 --> 3:52:36.820]  You get eventually the promotion of things like legal positivism.
[3:52:36.820 --> 3:52:42.180]  The destruction of courts and law was key according to H.J. Wells.
[3:52:42.180 --> 3:52:45.740]  Then he says education and knowledge have to be destroyed.
[3:52:45.740 --> 3:52:49.020]  Wow, knowledge itself, he says, has to be destroyed.
[3:52:49.020 --> 3:52:55.260]  If you read the socialists who were actually the progenitors of American education, John
[3:52:55.260 --> 3:52:59.020]  Dewey, Horace Mann, they say the exact same thing as H.J. Wells.
[3:52:59.020 --> 3:53:03.540]  They say that we got to get rid of this idea of reading, writing, arithmetic, and that
[3:53:03.540 --> 3:53:09.140]  education has the goal of giving people the ability to learn, teaching individuals how
[3:53:09.140 --> 3:53:10.980]  to learn for themselves.
[3:53:10.980 --> 3:53:12.780]  That's what education used to be.
[3:53:12.780 --> 3:53:16.100]  You're not going there to learn a bunch of facts that you repeat.
[3:53:16.100 --> 3:53:18.660]  You're learning how to better learn yourself.
[3:53:18.660 --> 3:53:22.820]  That's what research, that's what education was supposed to be, that's classical education.
[3:53:22.820 --> 3:53:28.900]  H.J. Wells says that education must undergo a revolution such that the universities and
[3:53:28.900 --> 3:53:32.580]  the schools become centers of indoctrination and brainwashing.
[3:53:32.580 --> 3:53:35.580]  Well, I wonder if that's happened.
[3:53:35.580 --> 3:53:38.300]  It has, if you don't know.
[3:53:38.300 --> 3:53:43.860]  He says that what we're going to bring then is a completely quantified and rational world
[3:53:43.860 --> 3:53:46.540]  order, and that's what technocracy is.
[3:53:46.540 --> 3:53:49.980]  That is, I mean, it sounds good on paper, well, don't you want to be reasonable?
[3:53:49.980 --> 3:53:53.020]  Wouldn't you want to be governed by rational principles?
[3:53:53.020 --> 3:53:56.700]  Yeah, but that doesn't mean what you think it means.
[3:53:56.700 --> 3:53:58.620]  It means whatever they say.
[3:53:58.620 --> 3:54:00.940]  It means it's rational to kill everybody.
[3:54:00.940 --> 3:54:02.340]  That's their view, you see.
[3:54:02.340 --> 3:54:07.340]  So what is rational is what the scientism devotees say is rational.
[3:54:07.340 --> 3:54:08.340]  That's it.
[3:54:08.340 --> 3:54:10.980]  It doesn't actually mean submitting to, yeah, exactly.
[3:54:10.980 --> 3:54:11.980]  That's what they think is rational.
[3:54:11.980 --> 3:54:20.980]  Then he goes on to talk about how fear will be key to bringing this in.
[3:54:20.980 --> 3:54:27.900]  Fear of the threats and dangers of fabled enemies will bring in the collectivization.
[3:54:27.900 --> 3:54:33.700]  If we can damage the idea of individual rights, of individual nations, of individuals, of
[3:54:33.700 --> 3:54:40.140]  firewalls, of families, enough, then we can bring in the technocratic world order.
[3:54:40.140 --> 3:54:44.300]  And that's why she says that one of the number one things on the chopping block that has
[3:54:44.300 --> 3:54:46.700]  to go is the family.
[3:54:46.700 --> 3:54:52.540]  Because what is the family but the promulgation of fascism and hierarchy according to him?
[3:54:52.540 --> 3:54:53.540]  I'm not joking.
[3:54:53.540 --> 3:54:54.780]  That's what these people say.
[3:54:54.780 --> 3:55:01.340]  The idea of a father as a father figure has to be destroyed, and they do it through the
[3:55:01.340 --> 3:55:04.460]  implementation of the oppression narrative.
[3:55:04.460 --> 3:55:10.380]  That the existence of a father is a fascist, oppressive narrative, thus the power of feminism.
[3:55:10.380 --> 3:55:12.620]  And A.C. Wells was a big, big, big feminist.
[3:55:12.620 --> 3:55:17.500]  He was 100% pro-feminist, just like Plato, whom he was a big fan of.
[3:55:17.500 --> 3:55:24.620]  If you didn't know that, yes, Plato was an archetypal feminist.
[3:55:24.620 --> 3:55:30.300]  And so he says that we'll have to utilize the strategy and techniques of the Fabian
[3:55:30.300 --> 3:55:39.740]  socialist technocratic strategies to eventually erode the West and erode the USA and erode
[3:55:39.740 --> 3:55:41.820]  what it is to be man.
[3:55:41.820 --> 3:55:44.420]  The idea of man has to change.
[3:55:44.420 --> 3:55:51.980]  Man can't be man in the abstract or a metaphysical, religious idea of man or what man is.
[3:55:51.980 --> 3:55:57.980]  Because if God exists, then we know that man has meaning by virtue of the worldview where
[3:55:57.980 --> 3:55:59.380]  you're a theist, where God exists.
[3:55:59.380 --> 3:56:00.420]  You're made in the image of God.
[3:56:00.420 --> 3:56:04.940]  So the moral law comes from God, comes from being made in the image of God.
[3:56:04.940 --> 3:56:08.420]  So there's right and wrong on that basis in that worldview.
[3:56:08.420 --> 3:56:09.420]  But A.C.
[3:56:09.420 --> 3:56:12.060]  Wells says that we're going to have to not just get rid of the idea of God, but get rid
[3:56:12.060 --> 3:56:15.540]  of the idea of what man is, changing images of man.
[3:56:15.540 --> 3:56:22.420]  Another global elite white paper written exactly in conformity with this document, the Stanford
[3:56:22.420 --> 3:56:29.500]  research document written by another one of the top elites, Wallace Harman, changing images
[3:56:29.500 --> 3:56:30.620]  of man.
[3:56:30.620 --> 3:56:37.420]  If we can change an engineer man to see man as the enemy, to see rights as his problem,
[3:56:37.420 --> 3:56:43.780]  to see the environment and the existence of the population being the problem, then we
[3:56:43.780 --> 3:56:47.020]  will win because man will turn on man.
[3:56:47.020 --> 3:56:49.940]  Man will depopulate man.
[3:56:49.940 --> 3:56:54.100]  Now at this time, yes, he even talked about as Bertrand Russell did, maybe we just need
[3:56:54.100 --> 3:56:58.740]  more world wars or gigantic bio warfare to go on.
[3:56:58.740 --> 3:57:01.180]  He says we need a new plague or some kind of bio release.
[3:57:01.180 --> 3:57:06.660]  Yes, if Bertrand Russell actually says that we need an impact on society, he says we need
[3:57:06.660 --> 3:57:11.580]  another giant death, black death or bio release to massively reduce the population.
[3:57:11.580 --> 3:57:16.900]  So what you're seeing today, what they're doing now was talked about 100 years ago,
[3:57:16.900 --> 3:57:17.900]  again.
[3:57:17.900 --> 3:57:22.900]  At the end of the book, he says countless will die to bring in this new world order,
[3:57:22.900 --> 3:57:26.060]  but he says it's sad, unfortunately, that we have to do that.
[3:57:26.060 --> 3:57:28.900]  I'm so sorry, but we have to do it.
[3:57:28.900 --> 3:57:34.020]  There's no other way to bring in the utopia and he sells it as a utopia, he says it's
[3:57:34.020 --> 3:57:37.820]  going to be Star Trek, you're going to be flying around, well you won't, but they will
[3:57:37.820 --> 3:57:44.140]  be flying around in spaceships and isn't it better to die for something than nothing.
[3:57:44.140 --> 3:57:49.020]  Paying for warriors, if you're like me, you've been a long time listener of this program
[3:57:49.020 --> 3:57:51.740]  and you've fed up with everything going on in the world.
[3:57:51.740 --> 3:57:58.500]  Inside you, like me, a fire is burning, something needs to change and yet we feel helpless,
[3:57:58.500 --> 3:58:02.340]  almost like we're stuck inside a system that someone else created for us.
[3:58:02.340 --> 3:58:04.860]  It's time for us to break free from that system.
[3:58:04.860 --> 3:58:07.500]  Race at Wars is a game changer.
[3:58:07.500 --> 3:58:12.620]  You start to see yourself more as part of the solution instead of just as a victim.
[3:58:12.620 --> 3:58:17.980]  So much of the stuff we look at today is low vibration, low energy, and makes us depressed
[3:58:17.980 --> 3:58:20.740]  and therefore we manifest this negative reality out there.
[3:58:20.740 --> 3:58:26.420]  When they feel their lie-cheat steel plan to enslave and rob the people, there is an awakening.
[3:58:26.420 --> 3:58:32.780]  Race at Wars has helped me to navigate and to pinpoint and lock onto the deep-rooted
[3:58:32.780 --> 3:58:37.460]  psychological tactics that were being used against me and now I'm not scared anymore.
[3:58:37.460 --> 3:58:42.580]  I have to say, I was blown away, I feel so much better every day listening to it.
[3:58:42.580 --> 3:58:47.260]  To Alex, thank you very much for putting the course together, you're absolutely right.
[3:58:47.260 --> 3:58:53.020]  We are reflections of God, we are emanations of that, and we can use that God energy to
[3:58:53.020 --> 3:58:55.820]  do really anything we want to do in this life.
[3:58:55.820 --> 3:59:00.300]  Romans chapter 12, Paul talks about how we're transformed by the renewing of our mind.
[3:59:00.300 --> 3:59:01.500]  And that's a process.
[3:59:01.500 --> 3:59:04.580]  Most of our thoughts and actions are subconscious.
[3:59:04.580 --> 3:59:06.940]  Most people go through their day and don't think about many things.
[3:59:06.940 --> 3:59:10.580]  You can drive along a long journey and not even remember half the trip.
[3:59:10.580 --> 3:59:16.300]  In this process, we need to have a concerted, active effort physically and mentally to reprogram
[3:59:16.300 --> 3:59:18.020]  that subconscious mind.
[3:59:18.020 --> 3:59:22.540]  That's what this series is about, is resetting our mind because there's a war on for our
[3:59:22.540 --> 3:59:23.540]  mind.
[3:59:23.540 --> 3:59:24.540]  He's exactly right.
[3:59:24.540 --> 3:59:29.660]  And he's become a great voice in our generation and in this new great awakening, and I encourage
[3:59:29.660 --> 3:59:30.660]  everybody out there.
[3:59:30.660 --> 3:59:53.060]  If you haven't gone there yet, go to resetwars.com, that's where your journey begins.
