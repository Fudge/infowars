[00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:11.520]  The Sound of Freedom was completed five years ago, but Disney fought them in the
[00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:16.280]  courts to keep it from being released. Hollywood employs several convicted
[00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:21.560]  pedophiles, and mostly at Disney and Nickelodeon, who specialize in children's
[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.000]  programming, and have even rehired pedophiles after they've served light
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.320]  sentences for raping child actors. Hollywood has been abusing children
[00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.840]  since its inception, including child actors of the 1930s such as Shirley
[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.520]  Temple, Mickey Rooney, and Judy Garland, who wrote that she was constantly
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.640]  molested behind the scenes by powerful men, including MGM co-founder Louis B.
[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.920]  Mayer. And nothing has stopped Hollywood from continuing this horrific abuse. It
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.560]  has been known for decades that governments have systemically abused
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.880]  children. Beginning in the 1960s, the German government began placing thousands
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.880]  of foster children into the homes of single pedophiles, and continued doing it
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.360]  up until the 1990s. Thousands of Catholic priests have been accused of raping
[00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.280]  children, and no justice has ever come of it. Jeffrey Epstein was targeting
[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.120]  individuals and recording them raping children as a form of blackmail, so that
[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:27.520]  powerful entities could control them. Epstein has disappeared, and so has his
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.800]  little black book. Many have claimed that Hugh Hefner was doing the same thing
[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:38.320]  for the CIA that Epstein was doing. In 1976, Hefner's Playboy magazine published
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.800]  erotic nude pictures of a ten-year-old girl, and nobody seemed to care. The
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.320]  effects on these children can often be fatal, whether it's from blunt trauma or
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.720]  suicide. And those who survive most often struggle with it for their entire life.
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:00.440]  To me, sexual abuse, it kills a child. I think it kills the spirit of a child. I
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:06.960]  think it kills normalcy in a child. So I just have spent a great deal of my life,
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.320]  you know, walking around really as a dead person in a sense, because I almost feel
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:17.160]  like I was murdered. Child abuse has been used as a form of trauma-based mind
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.880]  control because it often forces the child to disassociate, which has been
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:27.720]  known to create multiple personalities. MKUltra whistleblower Kathy O'Brien came
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.480]  from a family of multi-generational child abuse that sold her to the U.S.
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.640]  government. I developed a compartment in my brain, a little area behind amnesic
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.640]  barriers that was actually the neuron pathway shutting down in my brain in
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.560]  order to compartmentalize the memory of abuse, so that the rest of my mind could
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.840]  function normally as though nothing had happened. My father's sexual abuse
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.960]  expanded into child pornography, and he was sending this child pornography of me
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:02.320]  through the U.S. mails. And it was, he was caught. The pornography was confiscated
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:09.080]  by a criminal faction of our government. A local politician approached my father
[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:14.280]  and told him that he would receive immunity from prosecution if he would
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:21.120]  sell me into the CIA's MKUltra Project monarch. Some families practice incest
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.600]  and pedophilia to gain power and to maintain it. Inbred Jacob Rothschild
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.880]  explains it here while reading a quote from his inbred relative James Rothschild.
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:40.680]  In our family, we've always tried to keep love in the family. In this sense, it was
[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:47.080]  more or less understood since childhood that children would never think of marrying
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:53.720]  outside the family, so that our fortune would never leave it. You couldn't write that today.
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:59.760]  Our entire system is profiting from child slavery. About ten billion dollars
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.440]  a year in the U.S. alone, and our entire government seems to be involved.
[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.960]  Congress has paid millions of our tax dollars to cover up their sex abuse
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.720]  crimes. Thousands of children are being trafficked across our southern border,
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:20.080]  and now it's become trendy to castrate children and turn them into a so-called transgender.
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:25.680]  And if we the people don't do something about this, then the blossoming surveillance state
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:31.200]  will have a solution. Don't be surprised if our children are soon monitored 24-7
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:38.000]  under the guise of keeping them safe because we have failed to do so. While we cannot expect
[00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.480]  to rid the earth of all evil, something obviously needs to be done.
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.800]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:05:04.320]  The globalists are only humans. Yeah, they have control of the central banks,
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.040]  they have a lot of power, but they can be defeated. But some of their operations are
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:12.440]  gonna take decades to stop. But one thing you can do right now is take control of your body
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:18.280]  and your family's body by purifying the water that you drink and that you cook with. And you
[00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:24.140]  do it with the highest quality gravity-fed filter out there. This thing does 10,000 gallons. You can
[00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:28.440]  sit there and put hundreds of gallons through it a day. It purifies very quickly, and it cuts out
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:33.240]  thousands of chemicals to non-detectable levels. This is what I use, which my family uses. It's
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.760]  the very best system out there for the lowest price. For a limited time, 10% off on top of that,

[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:53.280]  procrastinate. This is one of the main areas we can take control of our lives and stop the
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.280]  globalists from hitting us with poison that they allow in the water supply. In some cases,
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:12.520]  they add the water supply like fluoride. The answer to 1984 is 1776. Live from Austin,
[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:23.760]  Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones. Right now, disgraced FBI Deep State Director
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:35.280]  Christopher Wray is testifying before Congress and being destroyed. How many illegal FISA queries
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:42.320]  have occurred under your leadership of the FBI? Well, there are reports that have come out with
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:48.600]  different numbers about compliance incidents. More than a million illegal ones? Because that's
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:53.520]  what the Inspector General said. The Inspector General said that in the 3.4 million of these
[00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:58.600]  more than a million were in error. Do you have any basis to disagree with that assessment by
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:03.720]  the Inspector General? I'm not sure actually that's a correct characterization of the Inspector
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:09.280]  General's findings on that. The internet will remind you of that in moments. But let's now go
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:15.880]  to what the court said. The court said it was over 200,000 that have occurred on your watch. Do you
[00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:19.640]  have any basis to disagree with that assessment? Again, I don't have the numbers I sit here right
[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:23.880]  now. What I can say- Seems like a number you should know. How many times the FBI's breaking
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:30.000]  the law under your watch? I'm sitting here with my father. I will make certain that between the
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.240]  man sitting next to me and every person he knows and my ability to forever hold a grudge that you
[00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:41.760]  will regret not following my direction. I am sitting here waiting for the call with my father.
[00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:49.320]  Sounds like a shakedown, doesn't it, Director? I'm not going to get into commenting on that.
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:56.120]  You seem deeply uncurious about it, don't you? Almost suspiciously uncurious. Are you protecting
[00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:02.600]  the Bidens? Absolutely not. The FBI does not- You won't answer the question about whether or not
[00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:08.080]  that's a shakedown. And everybody knows why you won't answer it. Because to the millions of
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:13.200]  people who will see this, they know it is. And your inability to acknowledge that is deeply
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:21.600]  revealing about you. The deep state is on the ropes. And the more they fight back, the weaker
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:26.720]  they're going to get. All we got to do is keep spreading the word and keep exposing the globalists.
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:32.080]  They're going down, ladies and gentlemen. But for those of us at the front line, the tip of the
[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:37.680]  spear, we got to be willing to give up our lives. We got to be willing to be put in prison. We got
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:43.040]  to be willing to have them go off our families. That's the commitment I've made to you. Because
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:50.720]  God's watching. I don't do this because I'm a hero. I do it because evil must be faced and God
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:57.200]  works through us to deliver justice. Oh, incredible transmission today. Wow. But
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:05.280]  Chris Wray being destroyed in Congress right now. And a major federal ruling, federal judge
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.120]  denies government motion to stay injunction by another federal court and landmark free speech
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:16.720]  case that's all about deep state surveillance, censorship, criminal racketeering. That's
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:23.120]  happening. A lot of good news and some really dangerous news. We'll be getting into a little
[00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:29.040]  bit later as well. And that's the situation in Ukraine. I don't like Zelensky. I don't like NATO.
[00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:36.000]  I don't like the war. But that said, I don't like the fact that Putin took the bait in the proxy
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.400]  war and up the ante because I knew it would escalate. Now it is escalating out of control.
[00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:46.480]  And Zelensky is a very, very dangerous man. And he's now threatening NATO. And remember,
[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:51.600]  he's been letting the world know what his threat is. He's going to blow up the giant
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:56.880]  nuclear power plant, the biggest in Europe, and blame it on the Russians to try to suck
[00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:03.440]  NATO fully into the war. And the Ukrainians have really gotten too big for their britches.
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:08.640]  That is, the people in Kiev running the show are a danger to the entire planet.
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:13.600]  And I don't think Zelensky, if he keeps running his mouth is going to be above ground very long.
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:18.720]  And when I say that, it's not a threat for me to Zelensky. I know geopolitics. I know how
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:23.360]  the globalists operate. And if he starts thinking that he actually calls the shots,
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:29.280]  he's going to be in the same club as Saddam Hussein and Salman Bin Laden and others.
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:32.640]  And hell, even Gaddafi tried to come in out of the dark and do whatever the globalists wanted.
[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:38.000]  They still killed him. So this is very dangerous. This is how you escalate a nuclear war. I'll be
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:44.960]  laying that out. But let's just cut live to the Congressional House Oversight Committee hearing
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:51.680]  that's going on with Jim Jordan. Absolutely not. Thank you very much.
[00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:58.080]  Let me thank you as well. Jackson and Lee slobber all over. Let's hear a little bit of the other
[00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:07.840]  side that the FBI exaggerates domestic terrorism. Certainly, January 6th had its many different
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:12.800]  storytellers, but that was an act of domestic terrorism. I don't know how you could have
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:17.200]  exaggerated that as evidenced by the special congressional committee we had. But let's just
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:23.520]  think as it relates to the good men and women of our law enforcement. Take an example.
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:30.880]  I know it's live. You can't pause. The Democrats literally say burning down cities is good.
[00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:35.200]  Killing cops is good. Random violence is good. And they're trying to float this idea that white
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:38.800]  supremacy is the number one crime in this country. It's not even on the radar. They
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:45.200]  create this own little special pie of extremist violence and then only report the few white
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:51.680]  extremist events and then say it's the majority of crime. It's like saying in my backyard,
[00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:57.440]  the biggest plant is that one inch blade of grass. But you've got a one square area you're
[00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:01.040]  looking at in the backyard. My backyard is this square inch. And the biggest thing is this one
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:05.520]  inch piece of grass next to a 200 foot tree. But see, it's not in the graph. That's how they're
[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:10.240]  lying by the statistics. But we don't need to be statisticians to know that. Are there white
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:15.680]  supremacists running around murdering people everywhere? No, they're not. They got articles
[00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:19.680]  out saying if you're in good shape, you're a white supremacist. I mean, it's getting dumber.
[00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:23.520]  They're now saying Asians are the number one white supremacist group. I'm going to show you
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:28.080]  these articles. This is a desperate globalist state that wants us all killing each other.
[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:32.000]  But, you know, I said I'd listen to her, even though it's super annoying because we're gonna
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.080]  hear some of the other live stuff from Republicans. So let's go back to Jackson Lee.
[00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:42.080]  Unlike what's happening in law enforcement more generally is actually up very significantly.
[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:45.520]  Thank you. And I look forward to being diverse. Let me start with our whistleblower
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:51.760]  journey here. Are you familiar with FBI special agents Kyle Serpen?
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:55.280]  I'm familiar with the name.
[00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:56.800]  Is that yes?
[00:12:58.160 --> 00:12:59.360]  I'm familiar with the name.
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:03.440]  Yeah. The committee heard testimony that Mr. Serpen was suspended after he mishandled his
[00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:09.600]  service weapon and then said he wanted to use two female FBI executives as shooting targets.
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:12.640]  That was testimony of Jennifer Moore, H.R.
[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:18.240]  under human resources under oath from the FBI. Mr. Serpen describes himself as a congressional
[00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:22.160]  whistleblower, but committee Republicans will not tell us whether he has been in contact with them.
[00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:23.360]  Are you familiar with former FBI agents?
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:25.440]  I'm sorry, I can't listen to this. Just turn it off.
[00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:30.400]  I told you we could listen to it, but I just can't. I'm not going to subject anybody to that.
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:31.760]  Unbelievable garbage.
[00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:36.800]  OK, let me tell you what we're getting to today.
[00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:42.880]  We have a lot of new developments on PedoGate and the great hero Tim Ballard,
[00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:48.000]  whose organization helped save over 6000 children over the last decade
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:55.680]  and who put thousands of pedos behind bars and the corporate media jumping the shark and saying
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:14:00.800]  jumping the shark and saying that it's all fake, nothing's happening and it gets a lot worse.
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:05.840]  Meanwhile, they've busted more pedo rings all over the country
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:10.000]  with the actual drug to kidnap children every day.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.600]  They find a dungeon or a basement full of a bunch of kidnapped kids with some handler running them
[00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:19.440]  and they find the cell phone numbers to hire ups that have them in the safe houses.
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:24.240]  I've seen five of those stories in the last two days. I've got those.
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:27.440]  I've got local newscast. And you're probably going to ask,
[00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:29.680]  why are we not hearing about this on the national news?
[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:36.400]  Well, why does Biden starting a month ago not allow the Border Patrol to DNA test people
[00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:40.960]  when they have no idea they don't look like the child?
[00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:47.520]  And it's a federal law regulation, but Biden's getting rid of the funding for it where they're
[00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:51.040]  going to turn children loose with no DNA testing. But it gets worse, as I said yesterday.
[00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:56.880]  So we'll go back over this, too. They've taken kidnapped children and child sex
[00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:02.000]  slavery and a bunch of other terms to report it off of the Justice Department website.
[00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:07.440]  So when you go there to go, OK, I want to call the bank robbery or I want to call the white
[00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:11.120]  collar crime thing or I want to go send a tip. I'm going to send a tip on sex,
[00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:14.800]  slavery and child sex driving. Oh, sorry, that isn't on the menu.
[00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:20.160]  Like if you call the fire department, I want to report my neighbor's house on fire.
[00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:24.720]  Well, fires don't exist. We don't have that. That's not a thing that's on the.
[00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:28.320]  What do you mean? What does the fire department do? Well, we go to automobile accidents.
[00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:33.040]  Well, what if a car was on fire? Well, sir, fire doesn't exist.
[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:39.680]  I mean, that's the level of the mind control like fathers and mothers don't exist.
[00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:45.040]  Two genders don't exist. It's all just cult brainwashing. Gravity doesn't exist.
[00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:55.200]  It's 1984. So we're going to cover everything today. It's going to be a massive broadcast.
[00:15:55.200 --> 00:16:02.960]  Stay with us. The globalists aren't just targeting us through the poison shots
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:08.480]  or the electromagnetic 5G or the GMO crops. They're hitting us with hundreds of chemicals
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:13.680]  that the EPA has authorized companies and industry to use. One of the top
[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:19.120]  pesticides used is atrazine. The allowable level the government admits that they allow to be in
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:25.200]  your water supply is enough to sterilize you and basically turn your son into a feminized mutant.

[00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:31.360]  the one thing that I have really found that makes a difference is RainForce. I'll take RainForce
[00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:36.800]  in the morning right before I go to my computer, and I'm good for the next four or five hours

[00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:34.500]  I've tried living it risky, relied on women and whiskey, chased my blues, turned my nights
[00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:46.980]  to days, first rage only a pastime, with age more than a lifetime, day in day out the world
[00:20:46.980 --> 00:21:01.260]  just turns away, but everybody knows you live and you learn, but the lessons just go on
[00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:13.139]  and on, I guess we're gonna have to wait for all the pages to turn, to find out if it's
[00:21:13.139 --> 00:21:18.659]  right or if it's wrong, you live, you learn, you live, you learn, you live, you learn.
[00:21:18.659 --> 00:21:21.659]  Alright, let's go back to some of the clips, then we'll go back to some of the live event
[00:21:21.659 --> 00:21:29.700]  of Chris Wray, the FBI, the Justice Department, the logjam that allows the illegal human trafficking
[00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:35.659]  of hundreds of thousands if not millions of children into sex slavery, sweatshop slavery,
[00:21:35.659 --> 00:21:41.580]  you name it, that allows the fentanyl to pour in, that allows all the Democratic Party corruption,
[00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:45.620]  that allows all the persecution of innocent conservatives and Christians, who allows all
[00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:49.899]  the money laundering through Ukraine, allows all the Chinese agents inside the Democratic
[00:21:49.899 --> 00:21:58.659]  Party offices, allows all the different Biden crimes, Hunter Biden's pedophilia, all of it,
[00:21:58.659 --> 00:22:06.540]  they're the logjam holding up getting our country back, they are the dictatorship,
[00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:11.659]  they are the Praetorian Guard that let the criminals that have hijacked our government
[00:22:11.659 --> 00:22:16.820]  stay in power, and the world knows it, and the statistics show it, and the FBI is the
[00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:22.220]  most unpopular federal agency there is, Congress has a 9% approval rating, the FBI has less than
[00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:26.820]  10% approval rating, the mainstream media has less than 10% approval rating, the people know
[00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:32.020]  they're a plague, it doesn't mean everybody in mainstream media or everybody in the government
[00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:37.580]  or everybody in the FBI is bad, but the people running the corporate media and the Justice
[00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:44.940]  Department, the Democratic Party are very bad, ruthless, crazy people, and the good news is it's
[00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:51.340]  coming out that they're illegally surveilling everybody, election meddling, and censoring with
[00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:56.260]  big tech and big companies, and it's in their own documents, that it's for political control,
[00:22:56.260 --> 00:23:02.139]  and it doesn't get more totalitarian than that. A literal ministry of truth is what the federal
[00:23:02.139 --> 00:23:07.700]  judge said two weeks ago when he blocked Biden from coordinating censorship with big tech,
[00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:18.980]  and just since this ruling two weeks ago, and now another higher court just blocked the attempt
[00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:24.860]  to lift the injunction, so Biden just lost again, his controllers just lost again, I have noticed,
[00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:29.860]  because I know how to track this stuff just with my eyes, looking at it and going over it,
[00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:39.940]  the censorship has absolutely mitigated, when I say mitigated, not total, but there's been an
[00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:46.220]  absolute mitigation, a large dial back of censorship on Facebook, on Instagram, on YouTube,
[00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:50.659]  on Google, I mean, I've seen a marked example, and I'm not going to give our enemies that watch
[00:23:50.659 --> 00:23:55.060]  all day at Media Matters that help quarterback this examples, I'm sure they're seeing it too,
[00:23:55.179 --> 00:23:59.899]  they'll have articles out saying, look, why aren't you blocking this now? Because it's a
[00:23:59.899 --> 00:24:09.179]  freaking crime, that's why, so I'm seeing major cracks in the dam of their censorship, and the
[00:24:09.179 --> 00:24:15.139]  truth is starting to surge forward, and once the dam breaks, they're not going to be able to put it
[00:24:15.139 --> 00:24:23.580]  back together again, when the levee breaks, have no place to stay, going down, going down, going
[00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:32.620]  down now, let's come in with that, come back from break, so let's play a few clips here of Ray
[00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:39.699]  getting really taken to the woodshed, here it is, can you define what disinformation is? What I can
[00:24:39.699 --> 00:24:43.699]  tell you is that our focus is not on disinformation, broadly speaking, well wait a minute,
[00:24:43.699 --> 00:24:48.020]  wait a minute, can I answer the question? You can in a minute, your star witness said in the
[00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:52.659]  litigation, Elvis Chan, who's in charge of this, said they do it on the basis of disinformation,
[00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:58.300]  we need a definition of what that is. Our focus is on malign foreign disinformation,
[00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:04.820]  that is foreign hostile actors who engage in covert efforts to abuse our social media platforms,
[00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:09.340]  which is something that is not... Back it up 10 seconds, okay, so remember,
[00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:13.220]  Hunter Biden's laptop was Russian, the FBI knew it wasn't, they made it up,
[00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:18.540]  they said in Congress five years ago, what is an example in the Armed Services Committee with
[00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:24.540]  the CIA, what is an example of a Russian asset or Russian disinfo? They said Alex Jones and
[00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:31.659]  Pull Wars, yeah right, so remember Donald Trump's a Russian agent, no, the Democratic Party are
[00:25:31.659 --> 00:25:36.460]  globalist agents who've sold us out to everybody, and the Russians are amateurs at the trough,
[00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:42.139]  Hollywood, the left, the Soros crowd, the big banks have first dibs on raping us,
[00:25:42.139 --> 00:25:47.860]  then the Chai comms get second dibs on raping us, then all the other criminal gangs and mafias get
[00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:54.900]  dibs on raping us, and all the medical centers get to brainwash kids and take them away from their
[00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:59.820]  parents and cut their genitals off, I mean this country is a shooting gallery for the American
[00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:08.020]  people, open season on our asses, he just hung, well we only block foreign disinformation,
[00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:16.179]  b-b-b-b-bolder dash, go back to this liar, we need a definition of what that is, our focus is on
[00:26:16.179 --> 00:26:21.460]  malign foreign disinformation. That is foreign hostile actors who engage in
[00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:26.379]  covert efforts to abuse our social media platforms, which is something that is not
[00:26:26.379 --> 00:26:30.139]  seriously in dispute. I have to stop you for time. That's not accurate. You need to
[00:26:30.139 --> 00:26:33.699]  read this court opinion because you're in charge of enforcing it. And then, July
[00:26:33.699 --> 00:26:39.500]  4th, we had this explosive, explosive 155-page opinion from a federal court in
[00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:43.620]  my home state of Louisiana. It explains in detail that the FBI has been directly
[00:26:43.699 --> 00:26:49.020]  involved in what the court says is, quote, arguably the most massive attack
[00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:52.940]  against free speech in United States history. The court ordered the White
[00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:56.659]  House, DOJ and FBI, among others, to immediately cease colluding with and
[00:26:56.659 --> 00:27:02.020]  coercing social media companies to suppress American speech, of course,
[00:27:02.139 --> 00:27:05.699]  conservative speech in particular. Director Wray, I find it stunning. You
[00:27:05.699 --> 00:27:08.940]  made no mention of this court opinion, either in your opening statement today
[00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:13.500]  or in this lengthy 14-page report that you prepared on July 12th, which is eight
[00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:18.580]  days after the court ruling. Have you read the ruling, sir? I am familiar with
[00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:22.620]  the ruling, and I've reviewed it with our Office of General Counsel. Are you
[00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:25.420]  deeply disturbed by what they've told you about the ruling, if you haven't read
[00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:29.740]  it yourself? Obviously, we're going to comply with the court's order, the
[00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:33.020]  court's preliminary injunction. We sent out guidance to the field and the
[00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:39.100]  headquarters about how to do that. Needless to say, the injunction itself is
[00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:43.460]  a subject of ongoing litigation, and so I'll decline to comment further. Let me
[00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:49.420]  tell you what... You know what he's really thinking there, right? He's thinking,
[00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:52.500]  my higher-ups have told me and the black cops they're getting ready to cut the
[00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:55.860]  power and launch a bigger war. They can't do it soon enough. We've lost control.
[00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:59.220]  They know what we've done. We got to go ahead and do a power outage and blame it
[00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:02.659]  on the domestic groups and start the terror attacks. We got to go ahead and
[00:28:02.659 --> 00:28:06.020]  launch a civil war. He's just sitting there going, we've waited too long, we've
[00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:10.699]  waited too long. He's thinking, blow the truck bombs, activate the sleeper cells,
[00:28:10.699 --> 00:28:15.500]  prepare to blame the American people, prepare the false flag. He's back
[00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:18.900]  at headquarters, you know, then going off to some park somewhere and meeting with
[00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:22.100]  one of the spook heads and just saying, he'll probably meet with Brennan right
[00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:27.820]  now and Obama, and they're just sitting around going, we got to get the
[00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:32.580]  green light from the 300. We got to talk to the Rothschilds, Rockefellers. We got to
[00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:36.379]  get the big combines. They're like, well, don't you represent them? The director is
[00:28:36.379 --> 00:28:39.620]  the Carnegie director, and he's like, well, the director doesn't have full
[00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:42.940]  authorization from the board. It's too dangerous to launch these operations, the
[00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:45.260]  public's aware of them. Well, we better launch them fast, and they're having a
[00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:48.620]  debate right now, setting off nukes, you name it, sky's the limit, bioweapons,
[00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:52.740]  they'll kill everybody to stay in power. I'm telling you, you want to, I'm telling
[00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:55.540]  you. We'll be right back.
[00:28:58.659 --> 00:29:03.780]  With all the craziness in the world, the collapsing borders, the war with Russia,
[00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:09.500]  the insanity, the currency devaluations, the economy going crazy, you are
[00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:12.699]  crazy, in my view, if you don't get high-quality, storable food and water
[00:29:12.699 --> 00:29:17.020]  filtration and self-defense. Now, we're not selling guns and ammo. That's for you
[00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:19.780]  to go out and get for yourself and learn how to use if you haven't, and I'm
[00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:23.420]  preaching the choir on that. But a lot of people got plenty of guns, but they

[00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:05.100]  me, why has Infowarsstore and Infowarslife not had a probiotic for more than three

[00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:04.900]  We have three original, one-of-a-kind toothpaste designed by my father, a
[00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:08.780]  dentist, at Infowarsstore.com that don't have fillers, that are filled with high
[00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:13.820]  quality essential oils and more. We have the turmeric toothpaste, we have the
[00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:17.280]  ultimate tooth whitening with pearl calcium toothpaste, and we have the
[00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:20.860]  amazing activated charcoal toothpaste, again, with a whole bunch of key
[00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:24.260]  essential oils that are so good, not just for your teeth and your gums, but your whole
[00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:28.100]  mouth, your throat, and more. These are really game-changing toothpaste. They're
[00:31:28.219 --> 00:31:32.100]  very, very strong. Most over-the-counter toothpaste have fluoride. Ours don't, and
[00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:37.860]  it doesn't have fillers in it. It is just chock-full of incredible things that God
[00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:42.179]  gave us through Mother Nature. So, it's now back in stock. It became a
[00:31:42.179 --> 00:31:46.340]  bestseller. The turmeric toothpaste is available again at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:49.060]  We're selling out of the tooth whitening toothpaste. We've got some of that left,
[00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:52.460]  and we also have some of the amazing activated charcoal toothpaste in stock,
[00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:55.699]  but it's running out as well. So, all three toothpastes in stock for a limited
[00:31:55.699 --> 00:31:59.060]  time, Infowarsstore.com.
[00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:04.500]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil, which is at the foundation of our
[00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:09.500]  entire food supply. Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of
[00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:14.020]  this essential trace element, which has caused an iodine deficiency in about
[00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:18.699]  half the population, and there are two things we need to do about it. We need to
[00:32:18.699 --> 00:32:23.940]  practice more regenerative farming. There are plenty of proven technologies in
[00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:29.500]  permaculture and biodynamics that will naturally keep the soil rich with iodine,
[00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:34.340]  and we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day.
[00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:39.460]  Derived from ancient sea salts found thousands of feet below the earth's
[00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:46.740]  surface, our Infowars Life Survival Shield X3 is hands-down the best. Pure
[00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:53.100]  nascent iodine stabilized in an activated triiodine form for a healthy
[00:32:53.100 --> 00:33:00.260]  thyroid and a healthy metabolism. Get yours now at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:08.500]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:08.490 --> 00:33:34.410]  Let's put the live feed of Chris Wray, the New World Order hijacker of the FBI, up there
[00:33:34.410 --> 00:33:38.610]  on screen for TV viewers, here in a moment.
[00:33:38.610 --> 00:33:41.490]  And then we will continue on here.
[00:33:41.490 --> 00:33:45.850]  We've got a lot of other news, a lot of different angles and things that I'm intending to hit
[00:33:45.850 --> 00:33:46.850]  and get into.
[00:33:46.850 --> 00:33:49.370]  Obviously here today I also intend to open the phones up.
[00:33:49.370 --> 00:33:55.450]  But when we went out to break and I was doing a simulation of the type of things I believe
[00:33:55.450 --> 00:34:00.850]  they're talking about and I know they're talking about behind the scenes, the deep state corrupt
[00:34:00.850 --> 00:34:05.490]  corporate global interests that have seized our nation and are basically swallowing it
[00:34:05.490 --> 00:34:09.970]  and dissolving it right now into tyranny, they in their own white papers and public
[00:34:09.970 --> 00:34:14.030]  statements admit they're losing control.
[00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:17.770]  And they admit they're all going to go to prison if President Trump gets back in.
[00:34:17.770 --> 00:34:21.930]  So when you realize that they are in control, more and more of the nuclear weapons that
[00:34:21.930 --> 00:34:28.090]  robots and computers are replacing the checks and balances that are humans, and you see
[00:34:28.090 --> 00:34:31.810]  all the wars they've started, all the crazy things they've done, and the fact that they
[00:34:31.810 --> 00:34:37.490]  released COVID out of a lab, they ordered the medical facilities not to give people
[00:34:37.490 --> 00:34:41.350]  known treatments to increase death levels.
[00:34:41.350 --> 00:34:46.510]  They paid hospitals 50 plus thousand dollars to intubate healthy people and kill them.
[00:34:46.510 --> 00:34:50.250]  They kicked families out of nursing homes that brought COVID patients in to get them
[00:34:50.250 --> 00:34:52.830]  sick and then kill them.
[00:34:52.830 --> 00:34:55.930]  They did this worldwide as a test.
[00:34:55.930 --> 00:35:00.090]  That's the Bill Gates's and Klaus Schwab's and the people above them.
[00:35:00.090 --> 00:35:07.410]  And so when they've already committed a massive genocidal holocaust against the industrialized
[00:35:07.410 --> 00:35:12.570]  Western world, they didn't have COVID in Africa because the Africans said, we don't trust
[00:35:12.570 --> 00:35:13.570]  you.
[00:35:13.570 --> 00:35:14.570]  We're not we're not going to take it.
[00:35:14.570 --> 00:35:19.850]  They had the lowest quote COVID rates in the world, a couple thousand deaths and only six
[00:35:19.850 --> 00:35:24.010]  percent ever tested positive because they didn't rig the machines to test positive.
[00:35:24.090 --> 00:35:31.690]  Remember the president of Tanzania as a scientist tested a papaya, tested a goat that came up
[00:35:31.690 --> 00:35:35.610]  positive for COVID at the settings the U.N. told him to use.
[00:35:35.610 --> 00:35:39.130]  They just turned the settings up where this piece of paper here in my hand will say you've
[00:35:39.130 --> 00:35:40.130]  got COVID.
[00:35:40.130 --> 00:35:42.430]  Remember all that fraud.
[00:35:42.430 --> 00:35:47.290]  So I don't get up here to be sensational when I tell you the crazy people running things
[00:35:47.290 --> 00:35:50.850]  will do anything to stay in power.
[00:35:50.850 --> 00:35:59.170]  And they've been teeing up and they've been hyping and they've been pushing that imminently
[00:35:59.170 --> 00:36:07.330]  right wingers, Trump supporters are going to attack the power grid via a cyber attack.
[00:36:07.330 --> 00:36:11.970]  That way they can frame people.
[00:36:11.970 --> 00:36:18.210]  And that once that happens, they're just going to have to put an Internet kill switch in
[00:36:18.210 --> 00:36:24.050]  that only allows certain websites to be visited, approved media and government, and that they're
[00:36:24.050 --> 00:36:31.330]  going to have to round up and arrest the evil right wingers that are planning a digital January
[00:36:31.330 --> 00:36:32.330]  6th.
[00:36:32.330 --> 00:36:39.730]  Now, I predicted they would do this two years before they did it, looking at the FBI reports
[00:36:39.730 --> 00:36:43.690]  that we're putting out and the national directives that Obama was putting out through his puppet
[00:36:43.690 --> 00:36:44.690]  Biden.
[00:36:44.690 --> 00:36:50.050]  And I said, look for them to claim that right wing MAGA groups are going to hack attack and
[00:36:50.050 --> 00:36:56.970]  bring down part of the power grid or large sections of the power grid.
[00:36:56.970 --> 00:37:00.370]  And that that'll be used for the new basically COVID lockdowns.
[00:37:00.370 --> 00:37:05.290]  And then they'll use that as the pretext for the Internet ID that once they turn the Internet
[00:37:05.290 --> 00:37:09.990]  back on, because they're going to say the Internet's being used to attack infrastructure.
[00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:15.950]  Once they turn it back on, you've got to have an Internet ID, which they're announcing
[00:37:15.950 --> 00:37:20.110]  all over the world right now, to be able to get back on and that people that don't get
[00:37:20.110 --> 00:37:24.430]  back on, sorry, you've got to scan to get into this grocery store, you've got to scan
[00:37:24.430 --> 00:37:29.390]  your smartphone to get gas, you've got to scan your smartphone to get on the Internet
[00:37:29.390 --> 00:37:35.990]  because you saw what happened when in, say, the Northeast or the West Coast or the Texas
[00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:43.030]  power sector, that's five states or the Chicago system.
[00:37:43.030 --> 00:37:46.230]  One of the six grids or maybe more goes out.
[00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:51.470]  You saw the devastation, you saw the stock market crash, 10,000 points, you saw the fear,
[00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:57.750]  you saw the riots, you saw two months of no power and we bet the heroes and the engineers
[00:37:57.750 --> 00:38:06.630]  and the men and women of the law enforcement barely got it back up.
[00:38:06.630 --> 00:38:15.470]  And they've got the main hacker, a Trump supporter, who admits he works with Russia and he's confessed,
[00:38:15.470 --> 00:38:20.670]  he's confessed to running the attack that brought down one third of the U.S. grid and
[00:38:20.670 --> 00:38:23.710]  killed one million people in the last two months with the riots and death.
[00:38:23.710 --> 00:38:27.110]  We've made it through it, we've come together as a country, but we've got to have this Internet
[00:38:27.110 --> 00:38:32.150]  ID, we've got to have the central bank digital currency, it's all just so happened to be
[00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:38.350]  ready and those that don't accept it are part of the group that did this, they're Russian
[00:38:38.350 --> 00:38:39.350]  agents.
[00:38:39.350 --> 00:38:45.150]  Oh, breaking, Russians just used tactical nuclear weapons, NATO's now officially joining
[00:38:45.150 --> 00:38:50.790]  the war.
[00:38:50.790 --> 00:38:56.910]  That's how it's going to go down.
[00:38:56.910 --> 00:39:00.710]  That's one major scenario.
[00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:03.310]  And that's the one they've been pre-programming the most.
[00:39:03.310 --> 00:39:08.550]  I knew their final pre-programming, like a jigsaw puzzle that's got 400 pieces about
[00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:09.550]  two years ago.
[00:39:09.550 --> 00:39:14.310]  Man, I've said about 500 times that exact scenario you just heard.
[00:39:14.310 --> 00:39:17.810]  And I said, you know they're getting ready to do it when they say, okay, right wingers
[00:39:17.810 --> 00:39:21.270]  that support Trump are going to hack the Internet and hack infrastructure and bring down the
[00:39:21.270 --> 00:39:23.990]  power grid for Russia.
[00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:30.150]  And so we've got to get ready to, quote, turn the Internet off so that they can't use
[00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:31.550]  it to shut things down.
[00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:33.870]  But who's really shutting down the Keystone pipeline?
[00:39:33.870 --> 00:39:35.950]  Who's really blowing up the Nord Stream pipeline?
[00:39:35.950 --> 00:39:39.930]  Who's blowing up the Russian pipelines, the European pipelines, our pipelines?
[00:39:39.930 --> 00:39:41.510]  Who's dissolving the borders?
[00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:44.810]  Who's shipping in the kidnapped children?
[00:39:44.810 --> 00:39:46.190]  Who's devaluing the dollar?
[00:39:46.190 --> 00:39:47.590]  Who's demoralizing the country?
[00:39:47.590 --> 00:39:50.590]  Who's giving us poison shots?
[00:39:50.590 --> 00:39:52.270]  Who's defunding the police?
[00:39:52.270 --> 00:39:57.030]  Who's letting radical, hardcore criminals, in many cases with no bail, people that rob
[00:39:57.030 --> 00:40:04.670]  banks are being let out with no bail in more than 100 towns and cities, including Los Angeles?
[00:40:04.670 --> 00:40:05.670]  Who's doing all that?
[00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:14.270]  Is it Alex Jones and Tucker Carlson and Andrew Tate and Joe Rogan and Donald Trump and Dana
[00:40:14.270 --> 00:40:15.830]  White?
[00:40:15.830 --> 00:40:22.510]  You know, those Russian agents that love red, white, and blue and ultimate fighting championships.
[00:40:22.510 --> 00:40:24.430]  Yeah, we're the ones you've got to watch.
[00:40:24.430 --> 00:40:26.310]  We're the ones that don't want you to live well.
[00:40:26.310 --> 00:40:27.870]  We're the ones that want to cut your power.
[00:40:27.870 --> 00:40:30.190]  We're the ones that want to cut your son's penis off.
[00:40:30.190 --> 00:40:35.230]  Yeah, we're the ones that want to, no, no, we're not the ones.
[00:40:35.230 --> 00:40:36.430]  We're the Americans.
[00:40:36.430 --> 00:40:38.350]  You're the Americans.
[00:40:38.350 --> 00:40:42.070]  We're not the ones putting a mentally ill man in a dress up there to tell you Bud Light's
[00:40:42.070 --> 00:40:43.430]  the greatest thing around.
[00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:47.350]  And just like Bud Light's now lost $30 billion and is the 14th bigger in the country from
[00:40:47.350 --> 00:40:52.750]  number one, the New World Order is going to be a thousand times less popular than Anheuser-Busch
[00:40:52.750 --> 00:40:55.390]  when we're done with them.
[00:40:55.390 --> 00:41:01.270]  So if Chris Wray and his handlers think their plan to cut the power and blame it on us is
[00:41:01.270 --> 00:41:07.790]  going to fly, if they think that duck's going to quack, if they think that dog's going to
[00:41:07.790 --> 00:41:15.230]  hunt, you're crazy enough to do it.
[00:41:15.230 --> 00:41:22.870]  And everybody needs to know the minute they cut the power, they've got MS-13 and other
[00:41:22.870 --> 00:41:27.110]  cutout groups that will claim their antifa, but it's really assassin teams that are planning
[00:41:27.110 --> 00:41:32.950]  to kill myself, Trump, Tucker Carlson.
[00:41:32.950 --> 00:41:37.590]  They're going to kill Joe Rogan because he's not going to sell out to them.
[00:41:37.590 --> 00:41:42.390]  And anyone prominent, Dana White's dead.
[00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:47.430]  But here's the deal, they can't kill all of us.
[00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:54.670]  But just remember, when they make this move, they're going to try to kill every major person.
[00:41:54.670 --> 00:41:57.830]  They've got names, they've got lists, they've got it all, right down to your local top
[00:41:57.830 --> 00:42:01.770]  talk show host that's fighting, got the number one ratings, just common sense person they
[00:42:01.770 --> 00:42:04.270]  know won't sell out during this.
[00:42:04.270 --> 00:42:06.710]  They know won't go along during this takeover.
[00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:09.470]  They're marked for death.
[00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:14.430]  And it'll all happen in one night, 10,000 people's houses are going to get hit.
[00:42:14.430 --> 00:42:19.590]  And it's going to be right when the power goes off, the minute the power goes off, or
[00:42:19.590 --> 00:42:27.430]  the minute they say the Russians have hit Ukraine with a nuke, they're coming.
[00:42:27.430 --> 00:42:34.270]  So I'm telling you, better be looking over your shoulder, better be frosty, frosty the
[00:42:34.270 --> 00:42:41.670]  snowman, because you're six is when they're going to come.
[00:42:41.670 --> 00:42:47.630]  And you know, here's the thing about this.
[00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:54.710]  Once the hammer drops, they tried to pre-broke him, everybody, that you get back into deep
[00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:59.710]  state by, say, flying an airplane to the FBI headquarters.
[00:42:59.710 --> 00:43:02.350]  That is not what people should do.
[00:43:02.350 --> 00:43:07.070]  People should hit the streets and expose who really did this on every national news channel
[00:43:07.070 --> 00:43:13.550]  and any live event or any enemy transmission they put out anywhere telling us in their coup,
[00:43:13.550 --> 00:43:16.790]  this is a finalization of their total takeover coup.
[00:43:16.790 --> 00:43:21.690]  Anybody telling you that they're trying to put their disinfo out, trying to then round
[00:43:21.690 --> 00:43:27.490]  up the next big phase, the next big tranche of individuals and take you to all the COVID
[00:43:27.490 --> 00:43:31.450]  camps they've conveniently built.
[00:43:31.450 --> 00:43:35.370]  So that's where we are.
[00:43:35.370 --> 00:43:40.370]  And that's just one major scenario that they admit under COG and Rex 84 and the rest of
[00:43:40.370 --> 00:43:41.650]  it.
[00:43:41.650 --> 00:43:45.730]  And I tell the military and I tell the police and I tell everybody, we don't want violence.
[00:43:45.730 --> 00:43:47.529]  We're not looking for offensive violence.
[00:43:47.529 --> 00:43:51.390]  But if the globalists cut the power and claim President Trump's a terrorist and has been
[00:43:51.390 --> 00:43:55.510]  killed or committed suicide or something, you know the hammer's been dropped.
[00:43:55.510 --> 00:44:00.110]  And if you comply with anything you're told to do, you will live in something that makes
[00:44:00.110 --> 00:44:07.370]  communist China, if you even live, look like a paradise.
[00:44:07.370 --> 00:44:12.990]  And it won't matter how much you serve them and how much you lick their boots.
[00:44:12.990 --> 00:44:20.310]  If your family history is good Americans, you're going to a forced labor camp.
[00:44:20.310 --> 00:44:25.990]  These are evil, low down, empty people that fundamentally hate this country and our Christian
[00:44:25.990 --> 00:44:30.550]  past and fundamentally know that we've stood in the way of their world government for hundreds
[00:44:30.550 --> 00:44:34.850]  of years.
[00:44:34.850 --> 00:44:38.190]  And they are not going to stop until we're all dead.
[00:44:38.190 --> 00:44:45.110]  You need to understand that because they're little men, they're pedophiles, they're scum,
[00:44:45.110 --> 00:44:50.270]  they're trash and they know and they need to defeat us and kill us to feel like they're
[00:44:50.270 --> 00:44:52.510]  finally strong.
[00:44:52.510 --> 00:44:53.710]  They don't want to live in harmony.
[00:44:53.710 --> 00:44:56.010]  They don't want no, they don't want prosperity.
[00:44:56.010 --> 00:45:02.750]  They want death at the top.
[00:45:02.750 --> 00:45:05.790]  That's why they've legalized pedophilia at the border for the borders wide open.
[00:45:05.790 --> 00:45:07.310]  They're not doing DNA testing.
[00:45:07.310 --> 00:45:10.270]  It's why they're making fun of real movies about real events.
[00:45:10.870 --> 00:45:18.510]  Because at the top folks, the government is totally gone and totally arrogant and we are
[00:45:18.510 --> 00:45:29.510]  ruled by scum like Barack Obama and Biden and his pedophile crackhead kid.
[00:45:29.510 --> 00:45:30.590]  And that's what we've become.
[00:45:30.590 --> 00:45:32.790]  We killed 60 million babies and said they weren't human.
[00:45:32.790 --> 00:45:33.790]  Well guess what?
[00:45:33.790 --> 00:45:37.110]  Then our rights don't exist either.
[00:45:37.110 --> 00:45:41.150]  There's a very good chance this is all going to get derailed because this is so crazy what
[00:45:41.150 --> 00:45:42.150]  the globals are trying.
[00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:47.670]  There's large swaths of the power structure and the establishment who are not completely
[00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:51.930]  evil but have kind of gone along over the years who now realize that the real danger
[00:45:51.930 --> 00:45:56.990]  is the ruling class and how disconnected they are and how invincible and how insulated they
[00:45:56.990 --> 00:45:59.390]  think they are when you're not insulated.
[00:45:59.390 --> 00:46:04.790]  Let me tell all the rich powerful people with your armored fortresses and all your dugouts,
[00:46:04.790 --> 00:46:07.110]  your security people hate you.
[00:46:07.110 --> 00:46:08.870]  The neighbors know who you are.
[00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:10.150]  Everybody knows who you are.
[00:46:10.150 --> 00:46:12.190]  You're just surrounded by yes men all over the place.
[00:46:12.190 --> 00:46:18.029]  The minute society goes down, the minute you think you're going to get the patriots and
[00:46:18.029 --> 00:46:22.390]  wipe us out, you may get the Alex Joneses and the Donald Trumps of the world, but you're
[00:46:22.390 --> 00:46:25.110]  not going to get everybody else.
[00:46:25.110 --> 00:46:28.830]  And for every Alex Jones, there's 10 million people right behind me.
[00:46:28.830 --> 00:46:33.750]  So I know you're going to lose and I know you're going down and I feel good.
[00:46:33.750 --> 00:46:37.390]  I stand in front of God no matter what happens and say, I didn't back down, I didn't sell
[00:46:37.390 --> 00:46:38.390]  out to evil.
[00:46:38.390 --> 00:46:40.110]  I did the best job I could.
[00:46:40.110 --> 00:46:42.029]  We sure mobilized a lot of people.
[00:46:42.029 --> 00:46:46.350]  We're going to give them one hell of a run because God's watching.
[00:46:46.350 --> 00:46:47.350]  But this is it.
[00:46:47.350 --> 00:46:49.750]  There's no more years of this or decades of this.
[00:46:49.750 --> 00:46:54.090]  This is just going to go on and on and on with more corruption, more insanity.
[00:46:54.090 --> 00:46:56.390]  This thing is coming to fruit.
[00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:59.550]  It's rotting on the vine.
[00:46:59.550 --> 00:47:11.550]  Its expiration date is over and it's on, absolutely, totally, completely on.
[00:47:11.550 --> 00:47:15.350]  And there's a real awakening of just how bad we've gotten, just how far we've fallen, just
[00:47:15.350 --> 00:47:22.910]  how crazy the corruption has developed into that now every major corporate channel other
[00:47:22.910 --> 00:47:31.390]  than Fox News is endorsing child sex trafficking, child sex mutilation, and attacking movies
[00:47:31.390 --> 00:47:37.230]  that are on record with thousands of convictions and congressional testimony and totally certified
[00:47:37.230 --> 00:47:40.590]  true story, a small snapshot of a much bigger story.
[00:47:40.590 --> 00:47:44.110]  And they're just saying, you know what, we're not going to DNA test or check the IDs of
[00:47:44.110 --> 00:47:45.110]  kids.
[00:47:45.110 --> 00:47:46.110]  We're just going to let whoever brings them in have them.
[00:47:46.110 --> 00:47:49.190]  We're not going to have a record of who they are.
[00:47:49.190 --> 00:47:50.190]  We find them dead.
[00:47:50.470 --> 00:47:53.390]  I mean, they're literally covering tracks while they do it.
[00:47:53.390 --> 00:47:57.950]  What Biden and Obama is doing at the border is like a criminal wearing a mask and gloves
[00:47:57.950 --> 00:48:03.190]  to come to your house and kill you.
[00:48:03.190 --> 00:48:09.550]  They're literally erasing the trail while the news tells you there's no child sex trafficking.
[00:48:09.550 --> 00:48:14.990]  I mean, it just goes on and on and on and on.
[00:48:14.990 --> 00:48:19.670]  And everybody better realize we're being positioned for total destruction.
[00:48:19.670 --> 00:48:22.590]  The new world order doesn't want America to even exist in the future.
[00:48:22.590 --> 00:48:30.470]  We're being positioned for collapse and absorption into NATO.
[00:48:30.470 --> 00:48:34.310]  Let's go back to the hearing and see if a Republican or Democrats talking right now to
[00:48:34.310 --> 00:48:35.310]  Chris Wray.
[00:48:35.310 --> 00:48:42.430]  Passed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, among other critical gun violence provisions
[00:48:42.430 --> 00:48:47.470]  in that the legislation begins to address the problem of gun trafficking.
[00:48:47.470 --> 00:48:52.950]  What steps has the FBI taken to implement or utilize this new law that actually helps
[00:48:52.950 --> 00:48:54.470]  to stop gun trafficking?
[00:48:54.470 --> 00:48:59.470]  Well, we're we're, of course, working closely with the Justice Department to come back to
[00:48:59.470 --> 00:49:00.470]  this.
[00:49:00.470 --> 00:49:03.550]  The Justice Department that ran hundreds of thousands of guns into Mexico and shipped
[00:49:03.550 --> 00:49:04.550]  them to ISIS.
[00:49:04.550 --> 00:49:09.830]  I mean, I mean, it's just, again, everything they say is a lie.
[00:49:09.830 --> 00:49:14.470]  Oh, is the FBI harassing with the ATF small gun shops?
[00:49:14.470 --> 00:49:15.470]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:49:16.470 --> 00:49:18.470]  Oh, did you dot an I wrong or cross a T wrong?
[00:49:18.470 --> 00:49:19.470]  Oh, you're going to jail.
[00:49:23.470 --> 00:49:26.470]  You can always tell what the answer is going to be out of these guys.
[00:49:28.470 --> 00:49:30.470]  We'll continue on.
[00:49:30.470 --> 00:49:34.470]  You know, I get so mad watching these hearings that maybe I shouldn't be watching it till
[00:49:34.470 --> 00:49:35.470]  later.
[00:49:35.470 --> 00:49:39.470]  Just watch some of the clips because randomly tuning into what Democrats have to say and
[00:49:39.470 --> 00:49:46.470]  the nauseating answers that these government bureaucrats give is, well, it's that it turns
[00:49:46.470 --> 00:49:47.470]  my stomach.
[00:49:49.470 --> 00:49:51.470]  Absolutely turns my stomach.
[00:49:51.470 --> 00:49:58.470]  But the good news is federal judge denies government motion to stay injunction in landmark free
[00:49:58.470 --> 00:49:59.470]  speech case.
[00:50:02.470 --> 00:50:04.470]  But it's a lot bigger than that.
[00:50:04.470 --> 00:50:09.470]  It's the government illegally, secretly with intelligence agencies interface with big tech
[00:50:09.470 --> 00:50:10.470]  and media.
[00:50:12.470 --> 00:50:19.470]  To surveil and then censor people and then sick the legacy dinosaur repeater propaganda
[00:50:19.470 --> 00:50:20.470]  networks.
[00:50:24.470 --> 00:50:26.470]  Against the very people they're silencing.
[00:50:26.470 --> 00:50:30.470]  So they don't just surveil you and then silence you and debunk you.
[00:50:30.470 --> 00:50:35.470]  They then lie about you in a unified field of propaganda being directed by U.S.
[00:50:35.470 --> 00:50:36.470]  intelligence agencies.
[00:50:36.470 --> 00:50:38.470]  Gee, who do I know they've done that to?
[00:50:39.470 --> 00:50:43.470]  There was two people that The Wall Street Journal admitted six years ago were being
[00:50:43.470 --> 00:50:46.470]  targeted to beta test this to roll out against everyone.
[00:50:46.470 --> 00:50:48.470]  And it was Julian Assange and another guy.
[00:50:48.470 --> 00:50:49.470]  What was his name?
[00:50:52.470 --> 00:50:53.470]  I forget his name.
[00:50:53.470 --> 00:50:54.470]  He lives in Texas.
[00:50:54.470 --> 00:50:55.470]  It's a talk show host.
[00:50:55.470 --> 00:50:56.470]  Oh, it's Alex Jones.
[00:50:56.470 --> 00:50:57.470]  Oh, it's me.
[00:50:58.470 --> 00:51:02.470]  You know, we can play the clips of the CIA and Congress saying Alex Jones is evil and
[00:51:02.470 --> 00:51:03.470]  bad.
[00:51:03.470 --> 00:51:05.470]  They're not supposed to operate domestically.
[00:51:05.470 --> 00:51:06.470]  I'm evil and bad.
[00:51:09.470 --> 00:51:14.470]  Because I sit here and experience your criminal activity and watch you child sex traffic and
[00:51:14.470 --> 00:51:18.470]  watch you put dictators in and watch you do all of this.
[00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:22.470]  And then we're supposed to just sit there and let you destroy us and turn our power
[00:51:22.470 --> 00:51:23.470]  off.
[00:51:24.470 --> 00:51:27.470]  Let's go to a congressman Republican talking to Ray.
[00:51:27.470 --> 00:51:28.470]  Here it is.
[00:51:29.470 --> 00:51:33.470]  Johnson had collected were mostly financial records and could easily have been corroborated
[00:51:33.470 --> 00:51:34.470]  as authentic.
[00:51:34.470 --> 00:51:40.470]  And by the FBI had the Hunter laptop in its possession for over a year.
[00:51:40.470 --> 00:51:44.470]  So it knew the lucrative payments of the Bidens from corrupt and anti-American regimes were
[00:51:44.470 --> 00:51:45.470]  authentic.
[00:51:45.470 --> 00:51:50.470]  How on earth did the FBI empower an agent under investigation for potentially corrupt
[00:51:50.470 --> 00:51:56.470]  performance and abuse of FISA in one politically fraught investigation, a Democrat operative
[00:51:56.470 --> 00:52:02.470]  driven case against President Trump to play a key role and to undermine a second politically
[00:52:02.470 --> 00:52:06.470]  fraught investigation, a case against the Bidens?
[00:52:06.470 --> 00:52:08.470]  How is that possible?
[00:52:08.470 --> 00:52:11.470]  How can you allow that to occur in the Federal Bureau of Investigations?
[00:52:11.470 --> 00:52:14.470]  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle say the elite law enforcement agency of the
[00:52:14.470 --> 00:52:15.470]  United States.
[00:52:15.470 --> 00:52:16.470]  How does that occur?
[00:52:17.470 --> 00:52:21.470]  I can't at the moment discuss a pending personnel matter.
[00:52:21.470 --> 00:52:29.470]  I can tell you that every employee who in any way touched the crossfire hurricane matter
[00:52:29.470 --> 00:52:32.470]  has been referred to our office of professional responsibility.
[00:52:32.470 --> 00:52:37.470]  Are you concerned about this activity by the FBI and what was communicated to the FISA
[00:52:37.470 --> 00:52:38.470]  court?
[00:52:38.470 --> 00:52:40.470]  Does that concern you as the director of the FBI?
[00:52:40.470 --> 00:52:47.470]  I consider the conduct that was described in the Durham report as totally unacceptable
[00:52:47.470 --> 00:52:51.470]  and unrepresentative of what I see from the FBI every day and must never be allowed to
[00:52:51.470 --> 00:52:52.470]  happen again.
[00:52:52.470 --> 00:52:55.470]  There have never been consequences as a result.
[00:52:55.470 --> 00:52:57.470]  Has he had consequences?
[00:52:57.470 --> 00:53:02.470]  Well, again, I can't speak to pending personnel matters as you would perhaps remember from
[00:53:02.470 --> 00:53:07.470]  your own time in law enforcement because we were working closely with Mr. Durham and I
[00:53:08.470 --> 00:53:09.470]  assigned agents to help him.
[00:53:09.470 --> 00:53:15.470]  At his request, we slowed down the administrative process to allow his investigation to complete
[00:53:15.470 --> 00:53:16.470]  itself.
[00:53:16.470 --> 00:53:19.470]  Now that it is complete, our personnel processes are very much ongoing.
[00:53:19.470 --> 00:53:24.470]  Well, I think it is more than troubling that under your watch, we see that this continued
[00:53:24.470 --> 00:53:29.470]  to occur and you have Otten being continued to be empowered after there was an investigation
[00:53:29.470 --> 00:53:33.470]  and after there was an effort by the FBI to look into why he would go to the FISA court
[00:53:33.470 --> 00:53:34.470]  and give wrong information.
[00:53:34.470 --> 00:53:39.470]  I mean, the issue here has been wrapped up in a cloud of politics, but the fact is the
[00:53:39.470 --> 00:53:43.470]  American people deserve to know how the FISA court is being abused and how it's being abused
[00:53:43.470 --> 00:53:45.470]  against the former president and against them.
[00:53:45.470 --> 00:53:50.470]  In light of the reports that we saw Mr. Johnson from Louisiana put forward, there was a court
[00:53:50.470 --> 00:53:52.470]  filing and a court report.
[00:53:52.470 --> 00:53:54.470]  I want to move on to another topic.
[00:53:54.470 --> 00:54:00.470]  On September 23rd, 2022, 20 heavily armed agents stormed the home of Mark Houck.
[00:54:00.470 --> 00:54:02.470]  You're familiar with this?
[00:54:02.470 --> 00:54:04.470]  I'm familiar with the Houck case a little bit.
[00:54:04.470 --> 00:54:05.470]  Yes.
[00:54:05.470 --> 00:54:09.470]  And this was after Mr. Houck's lawyer reached out and said he would appear voluntarily because
[00:54:09.470 --> 00:54:13.470]  the incident in question occurred almost a year earlier in October of 2021.
[00:54:13.470 --> 00:54:15.470]  So a year earlier.
[00:54:15.470 --> 00:54:19.470]  And the question here I have local authorities investigated the incident but concluded there
[00:54:19.470 --> 00:54:21.470]  was no case.
[00:54:21.470 --> 00:54:24.470]  After the jury met for roughly an hour, Houck was acquitted.
[00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:30.470]  How on earth did Mark Houck end up having the FBI send several armed agents along with
[00:54:30.470 --> 00:54:34.470]  local authorities to arrest him at gunpoint?
[00:54:34.470 --> 00:54:35.470]  And do you approve it?
[00:54:35.470 --> 00:54:37.470]  Did you approve of that?
[00:54:37.470 --> 00:54:40.470]  Well, let me start where you ended.
[00:54:40.470 --> 00:54:47.470]  Decisions about the manner of an arrest are not something that the FBI director approves.
[00:54:47.470 --> 00:54:51.470]  I defer to and rely on the judgment of the experienced career.
[00:54:51.470 --> 00:54:52.470]  That's enough.
[00:54:52.470 --> 00:54:53.470]  I can't listen anymore to this.
[00:54:53.470 --> 00:54:55.470]  We'll get you the highlights and go over it.
[00:54:55.470 --> 00:54:57.470]  I'm going to restart the show officially.
[00:54:57.470 --> 00:55:02.470]  It's been a powerful hour, but I'm going to restart the show officially when we come back.
[00:55:02.470 --> 00:55:06.470]  And I got so much huge news that it's on days like this.
[00:55:06.470 --> 00:55:07.470]  I almost choke.
[00:55:07.470 --> 00:55:10.470]  I want to say it's choking, but I'm just like, it's insane.
[00:55:10.470 --> 00:55:15.470]  Wait till you see the climate change, carbon tax, world government, digital ID announcements
[00:55:15.470 --> 00:55:16.470]  they've made.
[00:55:16.470 --> 00:55:18.470]  Bloomberg, AP, all of it.
[00:55:18.470 --> 00:55:20.470]  Massive tyranny out in the open.
[00:55:20.470 --> 00:55:24.470]  Just staggering levels of control that are being rolled out.
[00:55:24.470 --> 00:55:28.470]  Then we've got the huge Zelensky attacking NATO developments.
[00:55:28.470 --> 00:55:31.470]  I've got a bunch on the Sound of Freedom.
[00:55:31.470 --> 00:55:33.470]  And listen to this.
[00:55:33.470 --> 00:55:39.470]  A Franklin, Tennessee man finds a cell phone at a pizza shop that leads to the arrest of a soccer coach
[00:55:39.470 --> 00:55:41.470]  who drugged and raped young children.
[00:55:41.470 --> 00:55:43.470]  I've got stacks of this.
[00:55:43.470 --> 00:55:46.470]  And then meanwhile, they're saying none of this exists on the news.
[00:55:46.470 --> 00:55:48.470]  Oh, Sound of Freedom, nothing's happening.
[00:55:48.470 --> 00:55:50.470]  Look at this one, CBS News.
[00:55:51.470 --> 00:55:57.470]  Catholic Church spent $10.6 million to lobby against legislation that would benefit victims of child sex abuse.
[00:55:57.470 --> 00:56:01.470]  So what you've had is hundreds of millions of dollars by all these different groups
[00:56:01.470 --> 00:56:08.470]  lobbying to sexualize children like Disney does, and then silencing people that talk about it.
[00:56:08.470 --> 00:56:10.470]  It just goes on and on.
[00:56:10.470 --> 00:56:14.470]  So that's a big stack.
[00:56:14.470 --> 00:56:17.470]  We've got a bunch of news on quantum computing.
[00:56:17.470 --> 00:56:19.470]  It's just amazing.
[00:56:19.470 --> 00:56:22.470]  I'm going to get focused.
[00:56:22.470 --> 00:56:24.470]  I just started playing Rayclips at the start.
[00:56:24.470 --> 00:56:26.470]  It made me so mad I kind of went off on a jag.
[00:56:26.470 --> 00:56:29.470]  But that was good that I laid out scenarios I believe they're preparing.
[00:56:29.470 --> 00:56:31.470]  Doesn't mean they're going to pull them.
[00:56:31.470 --> 00:56:34.470]  In fact, I don't think they're preparing those scenarios.
[00:56:34.470 --> 00:56:35.470]  All the pieces are there.
[00:56:35.470 --> 00:56:36.470]  They've already set the stage.
[00:56:36.470 --> 00:56:39.470]  I predicted how they would do it, and now they've done it.
[00:56:39.470 --> 00:56:41.470]  Exactly word for word, as I said.
[00:56:41.470 --> 00:56:43.470]  So I'm in the enemy's brain.
[00:56:43.470 --> 00:56:52.470]  And I just hope they're smart enough to know that no permutation of any attacks they launch will work.
[00:56:52.470 --> 00:56:56.470]  And the bigger attacks they launch, the more it destroys them.
[00:56:56.470 --> 00:56:59.470]  But, yes, the more of us it destroys along with that.
[00:56:59.470 --> 00:57:01.470]  So I do like living.
[00:57:01.470 --> 00:57:04.470]  I really am not looking forward to the next bioweapon they're going to release
[00:57:04.470 --> 00:57:06.470]  and the new lockdowns and all of it.
[00:57:06.470 --> 00:57:08.470]  And that's just if we're lucky they're going to do that.
[00:57:08.470 --> 00:57:11.470]  I mean, are we going to sit here and take this forever, folks?
[00:57:11.470 --> 00:57:12.470]  We're going to break.
[00:57:12.470 --> 00:57:15.470]  Today is the last day for the July Super Sale.
[00:57:15.470 --> 00:57:23.470]  Up to 60% off to all Patriot Points, Nitric Boost, Super Female Vitality, Brain Force Plus, Brain Force Ultra.
[00:57:23.470 --> 00:57:26.470]  It's all there, and we need your funding to keep fighting.
[00:57:26.470 --> 00:57:28.470]  We'll never back down, but we could give out.
[00:57:28.470 --> 00:57:29.470]  So spread the articles, spread the videos.
[00:57:29.470 --> 00:57:30.470]  I see you doing a great job.
[00:57:30.470 --> 00:57:31.470]  But also buy the products.
[00:57:31.470 --> 00:57:32.470]  They will empower you.
[00:57:32.470 --> 00:57:33.470]  They will enrich you.
[00:57:33.470 --> 00:57:34.470]  They're really amazing.
[00:57:34.470 --> 00:57:37.470]  And 10% off on water filtration and all the storable food.
[00:57:37.470 --> 00:57:41.470]  I think that's going to get extended for a week or so, but I would take advantage of that as well.
[00:57:41.470 --> 00:57:43.470]  Hour number two, straight ahead.
[00:57:43.470 --> 00:57:44.470]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:57:48.470 --> 00:57:50.470]  The globalists are only humans.
[00:57:50.470 --> 00:57:52.470]  Yeah, they have control of the central banks.
[00:57:52.470 --> 00:57:54.470]  They have a lot of power, but they can be defeated.
[00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:57.470]  But some of their operations are going to take decades to stop.
[00:57:57.470 --> 00:58:02.470]  But one thing you can do right now is take control of your body and your family's body
[00:58:02.470 --> 00:58:06.470]  by purifying the water that you drink and that you cook with.
[00:58:06.470 --> 00:58:09.470]  And you do it with the highest quality gravity-fed filter out there.
[00:58:09.470 --> 00:58:11.470]  This thing does 10,000 gallons.
[00:58:11.470 --> 00:58:14.470]  You can sit there and put hundreds of gallons through in a day.
[00:58:14.470 --> 00:58:19.470]  It purifies very quickly, and it cuts out thousands of chemicals to non-detectable levels.
[00:58:19.470 --> 00:58:21.470]  This is what I use, which my family uses.
[00:58:21.470 --> 00:58:23.470]  It's the very best system out there for the lowest price.
[00:58:23.470 --> 00:58:28.470]  For a limited time, 10% off on top of that exclusively at InfowarStore.com
[00:58:28.470 --> 00:58:34.470]  on the Alexa Pure water filtration system in stock and replacement filters for folks that need those in stock.
[00:58:34.470 --> 00:58:36.470]  Get it today, and it funds the Infowar.
[00:58:36.470 --> 00:58:37.470]  Don't procrastinate.
[00:58:37.470 --> 00:58:38.470]  Don't procrastinate.
[00:58:38.470 --> 00:58:41.470]  This is one of the main areas we can take control of our lives
[00:58:41.470 --> 00:58:45.470]  and stop the globalists from hitting us with poison that they allow in the water supply.
[00:58:45.470 --> 00:58:48.470]  In some cases, they add to the water supply like fluoride.
[00:58:48.470 --> 00:58:50.470]  You wanted to plug RainForce. Do you like RainForce?
[00:58:50.470 --> 00:58:53.470]  Yeah, so my name is Ken Heckin-Ladley.
[00:58:53.470 --> 00:58:55.470]  How do I write all the books that I do?
[00:58:55.470 --> 00:58:59.470]  Four books with Dr. Judy Mykovitz, four books with Project Veritas Whistleblowers,
[00:58:59.470 --> 00:59:01.470]  and now two books with Alex Jones?
[00:59:01.470 --> 00:59:05.470]  That's because I use RainForce every day.
[00:59:05.470 --> 00:59:09.470]  What I always need is I always need some sort of boost in the morning.
[00:59:09.470 --> 00:59:13.470]  And so, you know, I try to exercise, eat well, take good vitamins.
[00:59:13.470 --> 00:59:18.470]  But the one thing that I have really found that makes a difference is RainForce.
[00:59:18.470 --> 00:59:22.470]  I'll take RainForce in the morning right before I go to my computer,
[00:59:22.470 --> 00:59:26.470]  and I'm good for the next four or five hours writing a whole lot of stuff.
[00:59:26.470 --> 00:59:32.470]  So it really is true that RainForce is something I use every day, and it helps me with my writing.
[00:59:32.470 --> 00:59:33.470]  All right, we love you.
[00:59:33.470 --> 00:59:34.470]  We'll be right back.
[00:59:34.470 --> 00:59:38.470]  Get your RainForce Plus, RainForce Ultra, and TurboForce at infowarstore.com.
[00:59:38.470 --> 00:59:40.470]  We'll be right back with hour number two.
[00:59:50.470 --> 00:59:56.470]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:59:56.470 --> 01:00:03.470]  All right, I'm going to hit it hard and start the next segment.
[01:00:03.470 --> 01:00:07.470]  But first, a clip of Andrew Tate talking about something really important dealing with COVID,
[01:00:07.470 --> 01:00:13.470]  and then a clip of where I predicted this all with Jesse Ventura more than 12 years ago, 13 years ago.
[01:00:13.470 --> 01:00:14.470]  Here it is.
[01:00:14.470 --> 01:00:21.470]  What do you think on support for the war in Ukraine, support for Ukraine's side in the war against Russia,
[01:00:21.470 --> 01:00:24.470]  support for a war against Russia in the West?
[01:00:25.470 --> 01:00:31.470]  Is kind of the bottom line issue for the people who run the U.S. government and for the American media, why?
[01:00:31.470 --> 01:00:37.470]  I mean, I guess you could argue about it, but there isn't an argument about it in the United States.
[01:00:37.470 --> 01:00:41.470]  There's a position, and anyone who doesn't hold it is attacked and punished.
[01:00:41.470 --> 01:00:42.470]  Why?
[01:00:42.470 --> 01:00:43.470]  Why is that so important?
[01:00:43.470 --> 01:00:50.470]  Well, the first thing I think we should all do is I think we should all give Putin credit for curing COVID, right?
[01:00:50.470 --> 01:00:53.470]  Because when his invasion happened, COVID went away.
[01:00:53.470 --> 01:00:54.470]  I haven't thought about that.
[01:00:54.470 --> 01:00:56.470]  Think about it. It's almost to the day.
[01:00:56.470 --> 01:00:59.470]  So we have to give him some credit, at least, for doing that.
[01:00:59.470 --> 01:01:03.470]  He may be the bad guy of the world, but at least he cured COVID for everybody nearly instantly.
[01:01:03.470 --> 01:01:04.470]  Fair.
[01:01:04.470 --> 01:01:06.470]  Thank you, President Putin.
[01:01:06.470 --> 01:01:12.470]  Yeah, I, up until this point, never really commented too heavily on politics.
[01:01:12.470 --> 01:01:13.470]  Yes.
[01:01:13.470 --> 01:01:18.470]  But I understand very well, I like to believe what's happening with Ukraine and Russia.
[01:01:19.470 --> 01:01:28.470]  And what I will say to the people who are watching this at home is that if you are naive enough to believe that there are good guys and bad guys in wars,
[01:01:28.470 --> 01:01:35.470]  and it's as simple as good and bad, and that the bad guys are crazy and the good guys want freedom,
[01:01:35.470 --> 01:01:38.470]  then you need to do a little bit more investigation into what's really happening.
[01:01:38.470 --> 01:01:43.470]  And when you look at the vested interest of any country or any person—
[01:01:43.470 --> 01:01:45.470]  Can I just ask you to pause and just comment?
[01:01:45.470 --> 01:01:47.470]  That's the truest thing, what you just said.
[01:01:47.470 --> 01:01:51.470]  And anyone who doesn't understand that should shut the fuck up.
[01:01:51.470 --> 01:01:52.470]  And I mean it.
[01:01:52.470 --> 01:01:59.470]  Having seen war, anyone who's telling you that it's Churchill versus Hitler is an idiot.
[01:01:59.470 --> 01:02:00.470]  Completely.
[01:02:00.470 --> 01:02:01.470]  Well, I'll give you an example.
[01:02:01.470 --> 01:02:03.470]  When my father was still alive, we—
[01:02:03.470 --> 01:02:11.470]  Jesse Ventura's conspiracy investigators have tracked down the deadly secret behind the elite group that tries to rule the world.
[01:02:12.470 --> 01:02:17.470]  When the population gets too big to handle, the solution is cut it down.
[01:02:17.470 --> 01:02:26.470]  There's an entire agenda afoot to force the population to undergo different type of medical treatments, namely vaccines.
[01:02:26.470 --> 01:02:34.470]  We're seeing a medical tyranny being set up, not just in the United States, but worldwide under the UN and the World Health Organization.
[01:02:34.470 --> 01:02:39.470]  They want a planetary dictatorship so they can carry out their forced depopulation agenda.
[01:02:39.470 --> 01:02:41.470]  And they want to do it through the medical system.
[01:02:41.470 --> 01:02:44.470]  And that's why vaccines are so important.
[01:02:44.470 --> 01:02:48.470]  We know that many of these vaccines turn out to have serious adverse reactions.
[01:02:48.470 --> 01:02:50.470]  This is being done by design.
[01:02:50.470 --> 01:02:52.470]  They kill you slowly over time.
[01:02:52.470 --> 01:02:54.470]  That's why they're called soft kill.
[01:02:54.470 --> 01:03:05.470]  We must acknowledge that the genetic—COVID-19 genetic injections cause far more harm than good and provide zero benefit relative to risk.
[01:03:05.470 --> 01:03:15.470]  The death rates from this vaccine are—there's been more deaths in eight months than in all the billions of vaccines combined over the last 30 years.
[01:03:15.470 --> 01:03:18.470]  50% of the deaths occur within 48 hours, 80% within a week.
[01:03:18.470 --> 01:03:22.470]  And I've got an insider I think you should really talk to, Dr. Rima Labo.
[01:03:22.470 --> 01:03:35.470]  In a very short time, not today, not tomorrow, but very soon, we'll be facing compulsory vaccination under the mistaken term of voluntary vaccination.
[01:03:35.470 --> 01:03:39.470]  Now, what is it about these vaccinations? You think that they're bad?
[01:03:39.470 --> 01:03:48.470]  Well, first of all, let's start with the fact that the World Health Organization has decided that we have 90% too many people.
[01:03:49.470 --> 01:03:57.470]  The World Health Organization has been working since 1974 on vaccines to create permanent sterility.
[01:03:57.470 --> 01:03:59.470]  Now, this is pretty shocking.
[01:03:59.470 --> 01:04:02.470]  This process has already been ongoing.
[01:04:02.470 --> 01:04:11.470]  To make matters worse, the vaccines that were illegally approved by the FDA contain a substance called squalene.
[01:04:12.470 --> 01:04:19.470]  Squalene, an organic compound used in vaccines to stimulate the immune system and increase the response.
[01:04:24.470 --> 01:04:34.470]  Now, the oil squalene is nothing compared to the new nanotech oils that do it but about a thousand times worse that they added to these shots.
[01:04:34.470 --> 01:04:37.470]  That's why I say it's a chemical biological weapon.
[01:04:37.470 --> 01:04:51.470]  It's got a nanotech self-replicating HIV spike protein, but it also has these nanolipid particles that do the exact same thing squalene does, but a much smaller amount does it.
[01:04:52.470 --> 01:04:54.470]  Devastating attack.
[01:04:54.470 --> 01:04:57.470]  And they all knew exactly what they were doing.
[01:04:58.470 --> 01:05:08.470]  With all the craziness in the world, the collapsing borders, the war with Russia, the insanity, the currency devaluations, the economy going crazy,
[01:05:08.470 --> 01:05:14.470]  you are crazy in my view if you don't get high quality storable food and water filtration and self-defense.
[01:05:14.470 --> 01:05:16.470]  Now, we're not selling guns and ammo.
[01:05:16.470 --> 01:05:19.470]  That's for you to go out and get for yourself and learn how to use if you haven't.
[01:05:19.470 --> 01:05:21.470]  And I'm preaching the choir on that.
[01:05:21.470 --> 01:05:25.470]  But a lot of people got plenty of guns, but they don't have enough storable food or water filtration.
[01:05:25.470 --> 01:05:27.470]  This is something you need now.
[01:05:27.470 --> 01:05:31.470]  And we've got it in the food department and in the high quality water filtration department.
[01:05:31.470 --> 01:05:37.470]  The highest quality food, the best water filtration at the lowest prices you're going to find and still get quality.
[01:05:37.470 --> 01:05:45.470]  Infowarsstore.com is running a special right now for 10% off on all storable food and on water and air filtration.
[01:05:45.470 --> 01:05:48.470]  Ladies and gentlemen, you cannot beat this deal.
[01:05:48.470 --> 01:05:50.470]  Our prices are already the lowest at 10% off.
[01:05:50.470 --> 01:05:52.470]  It's an insane deal for a limited time.
[01:05:53.470 --> 01:05:57.470]  Go to Infowarsstore.com and get prepared while you still can.
[01:06:00.470 --> 01:06:04.470]  We are here today to tell you.
[01:06:04.470 --> 01:06:06.470]  You picked this fight.
[01:06:06.470 --> 01:06:08.470]  You wanted this fight.
[01:06:08.470 --> 01:06:10.470]  Well, guess what?
[01:06:10.470 --> 01:06:12.470]  You've got it.
[01:06:12.470 --> 01:06:14.470]  Let's fight.
[01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:16.470]  It's 1159 at Radio Free America.
[01:06:16.470 --> 01:06:19.470]  This is Uncle Sam with music and the truth until dawn.
[01:06:19.470 --> 01:06:23.470]  Right now, I've got a few words for some of our brothers and sisters in the occupied zone.
[01:06:23.470 --> 01:06:25.470]  The chair is against the wall.
[01:06:25.470 --> 01:06:27.470]  The chair is against the wall.
[01:06:27.470 --> 01:06:29.470]  John has a long mustache.
[01:06:29.470 --> 01:06:31.470]  John has a long mustache.
[01:06:31.470 --> 01:06:33.470]  It's 12 o'clock, Americans.
[01:06:33.470 --> 01:06:35.470]  Another day closer to victory.
[01:06:35.470 --> 01:06:39.470]  And for all of you out there on or behind the lines, this is your song.
[01:06:42.470 --> 01:06:46.470]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Infowar and say,
[01:06:46.470 --> 01:06:49.470]  I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[01:06:49.470 --> 01:06:51.470]  You better believe you've got one.
[01:06:53.470 --> 01:06:59.470]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:07:10.470 --> 01:07:11.470]  We are back live.
[01:07:11.470 --> 01:07:13.470]  We are broadcasting worldwide.
[01:07:13.470 --> 01:07:15.470]  We are the Infowar.
[01:07:17.470 --> 01:07:19.470]  All right.
[01:07:21.470 --> 01:07:23.470]  I'm going to open the phones up.
[01:07:23.470 --> 01:07:26.470]  At the bottom of the hour, give the number up, and I'll intersperse more news.
[01:07:26.470 --> 01:07:28.470]  But now let me tell you what I'm getting into.
[01:07:28.470 --> 01:07:35.470]  Huge new developments in the Sound of Freedom and the enemy's insane, hysterical attack on it
[01:07:35.470 --> 01:07:37.470]  that blew up huge in their face.
[01:07:37.470 --> 01:07:42.470]  I mean, if you think the Dylan Mulvaney thing, sinking Anheuser-Busch
[01:07:42.470 --> 01:07:46.470]  and then leading to the sinking of Target and the sinking of all these other globalist,
[01:07:46.470 --> 01:07:51.470]  pedo-supporting operations, this Sound of Freedom jumping the shark is bigger,
[01:07:51.470 --> 01:07:54.470]  mark my words, than the Dylan Mulvaney.
[01:07:54.470 --> 01:07:58.470]  That's what's so beautiful about this is the enemy is just destroying themselves
[01:07:58.470 --> 01:08:00.470]  because they've been in power so long.
[01:08:00.470 --> 01:08:02.470]  They launched their major offensives.
[01:08:02.470 --> 01:08:04.470]  They metastasized their operations.
[01:08:04.470 --> 01:08:08.470]  This was supposed to be their glorious takeover, their glorious offensive.
[01:08:09.470 --> 01:08:15.470]  But it's running into a steel wall of people like you and I who aren't backing down
[01:08:15.470 --> 01:08:21.470]  and who've built our own media systems in the face of government, CIA, Justice Department harassment
[01:08:21.470 --> 01:08:23.470]  and criminal bombardment.
[01:08:23.470 --> 01:08:26.470]  We knew it was a war, and they kept saying,
[01:08:26.470 --> 01:08:29.470]  do you want more? Do you want more lawsuits, more attacks, more indictments?
[01:08:29.470 --> 01:08:34.470]  And we're just like, we cannot support you kidnapping and murdering children and raping them.
[01:08:34.470 --> 01:08:36.470]  Yeah, we have to fight you.
[01:08:36.470 --> 01:08:38.470]  We're going to fight you in the information war.
[01:08:38.470 --> 01:08:40.470]  We're going to fight you economically, culturally, and of course,
[01:08:40.470 --> 01:08:42.470]  try to take us to FEMA camps.
[01:08:42.470 --> 01:08:46.470]  We'll defend ourselves, but 9% of war is informational.
[01:08:46.470 --> 01:08:50.470]  So anybody out there shooting their mouth off saying you can't wait for violence is a fool.
[01:08:50.470 --> 01:08:56.470]  We will win this in the information war, which we've already done,
[01:08:56.470 --> 01:09:01.470]  and the enemy is now going to try violence because they're desperate
[01:09:01.470 --> 01:09:03.470]  and they think that's their only chance.
[01:09:04.470 --> 01:09:06.470]  They won't win with that either.
[01:09:06.470 --> 01:09:12.470]  And as much cellular satisfaction as I would get in a good fight with these guys,
[01:09:12.470 --> 01:09:16.470]  because they're going to turn and run real quick, that's not what we want to do.
[01:09:16.470 --> 01:09:21.470]  We want to continue to smoke them out and get them to manifest in front of everybody,
[01:09:21.470 --> 01:09:25.470]  just keep giving them rope, like letting the big fish you got,
[01:09:25.470 --> 01:09:29.470]  when you first hooked them, wait, you got them, now you know, let them run it out.
[01:09:29.470 --> 01:09:34.470]  When you got some 300-pound tuna on the line or some 500-pound marlin or 1,000-pound,
[01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:36.470]  you don't sit there and fight them right away.
[01:09:36.470 --> 01:09:43.470]  Let them run that metal leader all the way out, and then start bringing them in.
[01:09:43.470 --> 01:09:47.470]  And they're already exhausted, so we got them.
[01:09:47.470 --> 01:09:49.470]  We got them. We got them.
[01:09:49.470 --> 01:09:54.470]  So the only question is when that big fish comes over the bow,
[01:09:54.470 --> 01:09:58.470]  when you haul it over the side of the boat, is it going to thrash around and kill us that caught it?
[01:09:58.470 --> 01:10:02.470]  So it's a serious situation, but one way or another, they're going down.
[01:10:02.470 --> 01:10:05.470]  So the developments are insane.
[01:10:05.470 --> 01:10:08.470]  I've got a bunch of local newscasts and reports, not just here but around the world,
[01:10:08.470 --> 01:10:15.470]  of pedo rings being found, government people, school coaches,
[01:10:15.470 --> 01:10:19.470]  people that have power over children, drugging them and raping them.
[01:10:19.470 --> 01:10:22.470]  And the issue is we all know that's going on.
[01:10:22.470 --> 01:10:23.470]  We all know about sex trafficking.
[01:10:23.470 --> 01:10:28.470]  We all know just five, six years ago, Congress had hearings on it with Tim Ballard and others.
[01:10:28.470 --> 01:10:33.470]  And now you turn around and CNN says it's not going on.
[01:10:33.470 --> 01:10:37.470]  Rolling Stone says it's completely made up.
[01:10:37.470 --> 01:10:40.470]  These are convictions that Tim Ballard got.
[01:10:40.470 --> 01:10:45.470]  These are children he saved that were kidnapped for years, just the cases they show in the movie.
[01:10:45.470 --> 01:10:49.470]  That's a snapshot of what one organization did.
[01:10:50.470 --> 01:10:54.470]  So I still just marvel because I've got enough stuff for 10 hours here.
[01:10:54.470 --> 01:10:58.470]  I'm not even getting into it because I can't get over what they're doing with Sound of Freedom.
[01:10:58.470 --> 01:11:04.470]  Now the number one movie in the country for five days running, getting bigger and bigger and bigger,
[01:11:04.470 --> 01:11:08.470]  and they're in absolute, total panic mode over it.
[01:11:08.470 --> 01:11:13.470]  So first let's play a clip of him from a few days ago on Fox News, and he has confirmed for Monday.
[01:11:13.470 --> 01:11:17.470]  We've got other folks coming on in the next few days.
[01:11:17.470 --> 01:11:27.470]  Here he is talking about how he's amazed that CNN would actively come out and attack the movie and defend pedophiles.
[01:11:27.470 --> 01:11:36.470]  Then we'll go to his congressional testimony in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2019.
[01:11:36.470 --> 01:11:38.470]  This is very, very important information.
[01:11:38.470 --> 01:11:40.470]  Let's go to both clips back to back.
[01:11:40.470 --> 01:11:43.470]  Listen to this and have you respond.
[01:11:43.470 --> 01:11:46.470]  Films are created out of moral panics.
[01:11:46.470 --> 01:11:50.470]  They're created out of bogus statistics.
[01:11:50.470 --> 01:11:56.470]  And with something like Sound of Freedom, it specifically is looking at QAnon concepts of these child trafficking rings
[01:11:56.470 --> 01:12:02.470]  that are run by the high-level elites and only people like Tim Ballard and only people like Jim Caviezel
[01:12:02.470 --> 01:12:08.470]  and by extension only people like the ticket buyer can help bring these trafficking rings down.
[01:12:08.470 --> 01:12:11.470]  Do you want to respond to that?
[01:12:11.470 --> 01:12:15.470]  Yeah, as that guy's talking, and he's nobody's hero by the way.
[01:12:15.470 --> 01:12:18.470]  I can't imagine any kid looking at him thinking he's going to help them out.
[01:12:18.470 --> 01:12:22.470]  But I think of the children that are really depicted in that film.
[01:12:22.470 --> 01:12:24.470]  I know what happened to them.
[01:12:24.470 --> 01:12:27.470]  Those children were the subjects of child rape videos.
[01:12:27.470 --> 01:12:30.470]  Those children were being sold for sex.
[01:12:30.470 --> 01:12:37.470]  In total, you see over 120 kids actually are rescued in the story that's being depicted,
[01:12:37.470 --> 01:12:39.470]  even if the movie doesn't get into all of them.
[01:12:39.470 --> 01:12:40.470]  These are real kids.
[01:12:40.470 --> 01:12:41.470]  I see them.
[01:12:41.470 --> 01:12:42.470]  I'm still friends with them.
[01:12:42.470 --> 01:12:47.470]  So it's embarrassing and frankly grotesque for this guy who knows nothing
[01:12:47.470 --> 01:12:50.470]  to start throwing out terms like QAnon and connecting it to a real story.
[01:12:50.470 --> 01:12:52.470]  I mean, they're not even thinking about it.
[01:12:52.470 --> 01:12:53.470]  So what are they thinking about?
[01:12:53.470 --> 01:12:56.470]  Are they thinking about starting a pro-sex trafficking?
[01:12:56.470 --> 01:12:58.470]  It's so bizarre.
[01:12:58.470 --> 01:13:00.470]  It's like they're pro-sex trafficking.
[01:13:00.470 --> 01:13:03.470]  Like, leave the industry alone.
[01:13:03.470 --> 01:13:05.470]  That's how it feels to me.
[01:13:05.470 --> 01:13:07.470]  It feels like there's some other agenda because why do this?
[01:13:07.470 --> 01:13:10.470]  There's that one scene in the movie where it's an older man,
[01:13:10.470 --> 01:13:15.470]  and he's picking out what little boy or what little girl he wants to take into,
[01:13:15.470 --> 01:13:18.470]  I just can't even talk about it, but to take away,
[01:13:18.470 --> 01:13:20.470]  and we know what's going to happen to that child.
[01:13:20.470 --> 01:13:24.470]  Does that really happen, and how often does it happen?
[01:13:24.470 --> 01:13:27.470]  Well, this is happening all the time.
[01:13:27.470 --> 01:13:31.470]  I mean, there are 6 million children, believe it or not,
[01:13:31.470 --> 01:13:34.470]  according to the Department of Labor, Department of State,
[01:13:34.470 --> 01:13:39.470]  who are stuck in slavery of one kind or another, either it's sex, labor, or organ harvesting.
[01:13:39.470 --> 01:13:43.470]  I mean, organ harvesting, we've been taking down several organ harvesting rings
[01:13:43.470 --> 01:13:47.470]  where they take little babies and, you know, use them that way.
[01:13:47.470 --> 01:13:52.470]  And so we see everything, you know, and the film depicts every kind,
[01:13:52.470 --> 01:13:55.470]  whether it's the lure, like you mentioned, that's a real person,
[01:13:55.470 --> 01:14:01.470]  that beauty queen who was recruiting kids as young as 9 years old.
[01:14:02.470 --> 01:14:06.470]  Now I want to go to the congressional testimony here in a moment from now 4 years ago,
[01:14:06.470 --> 01:14:10.470]  but think about something here.
[01:14:10.470 --> 01:14:17.470]  I've met with federal agents and high-level federal officials in the courts.
[01:14:17.470 --> 01:14:19.470]  I mean, head people.
[01:14:19.470 --> 01:14:22.470]  And the numbers are all public and in their courts.
[01:14:22.470 --> 01:14:24.470]  So they said, this is public, we'd like you to get this to everybody,
[01:14:24.470 --> 01:14:26.470]  we'd like you to put it out, we'd like you to get Joe Rogan to put it out,
[01:14:26.470 --> 01:14:28.470]  we'd like you to give it to Tucker Carlson.
[01:14:28.470 --> 01:14:32.470]  Tucker got fired like 2 weeks later and was on the story.
[01:14:32.470 --> 01:14:35.470]  But not from me, he was getting it from all these people.
[01:14:35.470 --> 01:14:39.470]  And this is high-level federal officials, okay, saying,
[01:14:39.470 --> 01:14:46.470]  Mr. Jones, we have 30,000 children just in Texas in the last year,
[01:14:46.470 --> 01:14:52.470]  as young as 6 months old, that we catch with convicted pedophiles,
[01:14:52.470 --> 01:14:58.470]  and sometimes 4, 5, 6 convictions in Mexico, in the U.S.
[01:14:58.470 --> 01:15:04.470]  And the Attorney General of the United States will not let us charge them.
[01:15:04.470 --> 01:15:06.470]  And we have to let them go.
[01:15:06.470 --> 01:15:10.470]  And so we're just talking to everybody who's prominent, what do you think we should do?
[01:15:10.470 --> 01:15:12.470]  And I'm like, well, you're the expert.
[01:15:12.470 --> 01:15:15.470]  They're like, well, here's all these cases, our docket, our court is public,
[01:15:15.470 --> 01:15:19.470]  the magistrates, the judges are public, and we'd like you to look into this.
[01:15:19.470 --> 01:15:21.470]  Because this is human trafficking.
[01:15:21.470 --> 01:15:23.470]  And you see the congressional hearings, where they show the evidence,
[01:15:23.470 --> 01:15:25.470]  and they point at Americans, and they say,
[01:15:25.470 --> 01:15:27.470]  you are the biggest human smuggler right now in the world.
[01:15:27.470 --> 01:15:30.470]  I mean, this is bigger than the black slave trade at its peak worldwide,
[01:15:30.470 --> 01:15:32.470]  which was terrible and horrible.
[01:15:32.470 --> 01:15:35.470]  But this is going on now.
[01:15:35.470 --> 01:15:37.470]  And they're making jokes about it.
[01:15:37.470 --> 01:15:38.470]  Like, that's indicative.
[01:15:38.470 --> 01:15:43.470]  That one clip of CNN they played, where, oh, this is just made-up statistics,
[01:15:43.470 --> 01:15:47.470]  and there's elites and child trafficking, and this is insane.
[01:15:47.470 --> 01:15:49.470]  That's Jeffrey Epstein.
[01:15:49.470 --> 01:15:50.470]  And here's how the Democrats operate.
[01:15:50.470 --> 01:15:55.470]  Remember in the Sandy Hook show trial, the judge already said I was guilty,
[01:15:55.470 --> 01:16:00.470]  that I'm attacking children for just simply questioning a shooting 10 years ago.
[01:16:00.470 --> 01:16:04.470]  They say, Mr. Jones, you believe the government's involved in child trafficking
[01:16:04.470 --> 01:16:05.470]  with high-level officials.
[01:16:05.470 --> 01:16:09.470]  And I mean, you mean like the Clintons and Jeffrey Epstein?
[01:16:09.470 --> 01:16:10.470]  Remember that clip?
[01:16:10.470 --> 01:16:11.470]  That guy's fine then.
[01:16:12.470 --> 01:16:18.470]  Then they cut Joe Rogan in going, whoa, and all the rest of it.
[01:16:18.470 --> 01:16:24.470]  And it got like 50 million views or whatever, literally, or more.
[01:16:24.470 --> 01:16:30.470]  But imagine being in a court, and that's the idea on the left, is, oh, Jones is bad.
[01:16:30.470 --> 01:16:32.470]  He claims this even exists.
[01:16:32.470 --> 01:16:33.470]  It's like, Jones is crazy.
[01:16:33.470 --> 01:16:36.470]  He claims there's a thing called Staten Island in New York,
[01:16:36.470 --> 01:16:38.470]  and there's a thing called the Statue of Liberty.
[01:16:38.470 --> 01:16:40.470]  Anybody can go see that.
[01:16:40.470 --> 01:16:42.470]  Anybody knows that's true.
[01:16:42.470 --> 01:16:48.470]  So that's what's so mind-boggling to me is there's Ballard,
[01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:56.470]  who's an incredible person, literally getting thousands and thousands of children saved.
[01:16:56.470 --> 01:17:00.470]  His movie's only about 100 or less, a snapshot.
[01:17:00.470 --> 01:17:02.470]  There's convictions.
[01:17:02.470 --> 01:17:05.470]  This happened, and the CNN is saying, oh, this is terrible.
[01:17:05.470 --> 01:17:06.470]  This is made up.
[01:17:06.470 --> 01:17:07.470]  This is made up.
[01:17:07.470 --> 01:17:11.470]  These guys want to be your savior.
[01:17:11.470 --> 01:17:15.470]  I love how Ballard said, yeah, that guy doesn't look like he's going to save anybody.
[01:17:15.470 --> 01:17:19.470]  But remember, even the New York Times now admits massive sex slavery, massive.
[01:17:19.470 --> 01:17:22.470]  And the organ harvesting is very real and has come out.
[01:17:22.470 --> 01:17:24.470]  It's been all over the news.
[01:17:24.470 --> 01:17:28.470]  So who gives them the talking points on every major channel
[01:17:28.470 --> 01:17:32.470]  except Fox of corporate mainstream to say this isn't going on?
[01:17:32.470 --> 01:17:34.470]  Because everybody knows it was a big story until a few years ago.
[01:17:34.470 --> 01:17:38.470]  But now with Biden and all of it coming out, they're like, whoa, the public knows who we are.
[01:17:38.470 --> 01:17:39.470]  They know what's going on.
[01:17:39.470 --> 01:17:41.470]  Tell everybody to say this doesn't exist.
[01:17:41.470 --> 01:17:47.470]  Now it's taboo to talk about the open border and the kids being brought across
[01:17:47.470 --> 01:17:58.470]  and 30,000 in just the last year in Texas, 30,000 that they've apprehended with men,
[01:17:58.470 --> 01:18:02.470]  and 20,000 of the men they've apprehended and stopped, they're told to let go,
[01:18:02.470 --> 01:18:04.470]  sex crime backgrounds.
[01:18:04.470 --> 01:18:07.470]  They were saying, here, check this docket case.
[01:18:07.470 --> 01:18:08.470]  Here's just one.
[01:18:08.470 --> 01:18:16.470]  And it was a man convicted five times from some Central American company, I forget,
[01:18:16.470 --> 01:18:19.470]  back in the U.S., caught working in a South Texas town,
[01:18:19.470 --> 01:18:25.470]  driving a short bus for the mentally disabled children, raping them.
[01:18:25.470 --> 01:18:31.470]  And they're having trouble getting the Justice Department to green light prosecuting him.
[01:18:31.470 --> 01:18:33.470]  Let me say that again.
[01:18:33.470 --> 01:18:36.470]  And that case was handed over to us, and we're getting a report on it.
[01:18:36.470 --> 01:18:40.470]  I mean, imagine drinking through a fire hose of this, and then you turn on CNN.
[01:18:40.470 --> 01:18:42.470]  They say this does not exist.
[01:18:42.470 --> 01:18:44.470]  This is not happening.
[01:18:44.470 --> 01:18:47.470]  Remember, they told you Hunter Biden's laptop is not real.
[01:18:47.470 --> 01:18:50.470]  They knew full well it was real.
[01:18:50.470 --> 01:18:57.470]  Now imagine we have a federal government and a controlled corporate media at the top.
[01:18:58.470 --> 01:19:02.470]  It's only those few at the top and the media.
[01:19:02.470 --> 01:19:05.470]  They don't even have control of the courts in most cases now.
[01:19:05.470 --> 01:19:09.470]  Look at those federal judges slapping down Obama, saying,
[01:19:09.470 --> 01:19:11.470]  that's who the president is right now.
[01:19:11.470 --> 01:19:15.470]  You're not allowed to surveil the American people and then spy on them with the CIA
[01:19:15.470 --> 01:19:16.470]  and then censor them.
[01:19:16.470 --> 01:19:18.470]  And then the FBI director goes, I don't know anything about that.
[01:19:22.470 --> 01:19:25.470]  They're caught red-handed.
[01:19:25.470 --> 01:19:27.470]  So the government's not our enemy.
[01:19:27.470 --> 01:19:29.470]  There are a lot of good people in it.
[01:19:29.470 --> 01:19:33.470]  But the top group that's in control is because they are our enemy.
[01:19:33.470 --> 01:19:35.470]  They're coming after us.
[01:19:36.470 --> 01:19:39.470]  The good news is they're politically destroyed.
[01:19:41.470 --> 01:19:42.470]  Go ahead and go to Ballard.
[01:19:44.470 --> 01:19:47.470]  These children, the real children, have nobody.
[01:19:47.470 --> 01:19:49.470]  I know, I've seen them.
[01:19:49.470 --> 01:19:50.470]  I've seen dozens of them.
[01:19:50.470 --> 01:19:51.470]  They have nobody.
[01:19:51.470 --> 01:19:56.470]  The only adults in their lives want to sell them, traffic them, and rape them.
[01:19:56.470 --> 01:19:58.470]  And so we must run to them.
[01:19:58.470 --> 01:20:00.470]  We must be their parents.
[01:20:00.470 --> 01:20:02.470]  If not us, who?
[01:20:02.470 --> 01:20:07.470]  If not this esteemed committee with the power and authority to rescue lives,
[01:20:07.470 --> 01:20:09.470]  if not you, then I ask, who?
[01:20:09.470 --> 01:20:12.470]  Operation Underground Railroad has rescued over 2,000 victims
[01:20:12.470 --> 01:20:16.470]  and assisted in the arrest of over 1,000 traffickers and pedophiles.
[01:20:17.470 --> 01:20:20.470]  Much of my work has been based on simple economics.
[01:20:20.470 --> 01:20:23.470]  The United States is one of the highest, if not the highest,
[01:20:23.470 --> 01:20:26.470]  consumers of child pornography in the world.
[01:20:26.470 --> 01:20:28.470]  We are the demand for child sex.
[01:20:29.470 --> 01:20:33.470]  As such, traffickers around the world seek to bring children to the United States
[01:20:33.470 --> 01:20:36.470]  where they can sell them for sex and make a lot of money.
[01:20:37.470 --> 01:20:40.470]  My number one personal and professional goal
[01:20:40.470 --> 01:20:45.470]  has been to keep these children out of the hands of these sick American pedophiles.
[01:20:46.470 --> 01:20:49.470]  I want to share one case in which we failed to do this.
[01:20:50.470 --> 01:20:54.470]  The victim was a foreign-born child around 12 years old, who we will call Lily.
[01:20:55.470 --> 01:20:57.470]  Lily was kidnapped south of the border.
[01:20:57.470 --> 01:20:59.470]  She was then taken along with several other children her age
[01:20:59.470 --> 01:21:02.470]  and smuggled into the United States, not through a port of entry,
[01:21:02.470 --> 01:21:08.470]  but rather through a part of the southern border without significant barriers or a wall.
[01:21:09.470 --> 01:21:12.470]  Lily's traffickers easily transported her to New York City
[01:21:12.470 --> 01:21:17.470]  where she was raped between 30 and 40 times a day.
[01:21:17.470 --> 01:21:20.470]  And this is not atypical at all for a case like this.
[01:21:21.470 --> 01:21:26.470]  She believes that she alone was raped over 20,000 times
[01:21:26.470 --> 01:21:29.470]  between the age of 13 and 17 right here in our country.
[01:21:30.470 --> 01:21:33.470]  She eventually escaped and my foundation is now caring for her
[01:21:34.470 --> 01:21:37.470]  as she prepares to testify in federal court against her captors.
[01:21:38.470 --> 01:21:43.470]  In accordance with U.S. laws, Lily, as a survivor of sex trafficking,
[01:21:43.470 --> 01:21:45.470]  she has been granted legal status
[01:21:45.470 --> 01:21:48.470]  and we're helping her to complete the process of becoming a U.S. citizen.
[01:21:49.470 --> 01:21:53.470]  The U.S. Attorney's Office has requested that we not publicly share any more details about this case
[01:21:53.470 --> 01:21:55.470]  as it's going to trial later this year.
[01:21:56.470 --> 01:21:58.470]  Recounting her experience, and this is key,
[01:21:58.470 --> 01:22:01.470]  Lily has often asked me a simple yet powerful question.
[01:22:02.470 --> 01:22:06.470]  Why was there no wall or barrier on the southern border for me?
[01:22:07.470 --> 01:22:09.470]  A barrier would have saved me.
[01:22:10.470 --> 01:22:11.470]  What is she talking about?
[01:22:11.470 --> 01:22:13.470]  It's pretty simple what she's talking about.
[01:22:14.470 --> 01:22:17.470]  I've been quite surprised of late to see politicians and others
[01:22:17.470 --> 01:22:19.470]  who are opposed to building barriers and walls
[01:22:19.470 --> 01:22:22.470]  hail the successes of drug seizures and rescues at ports of entry
[01:22:22.470 --> 01:22:24.470]  and using those successes to say,
[01:22:24.470 --> 01:22:27.470]  see, we don't need walls or barriers, we have ports of entry.
[01:22:27.470 --> 01:22:29.470]  The bad guys come through ports of entry.
[01:22:29.470 --> 01:22:33.470]  In fact, we don't have ports of entry without walls.
[01:22:34.470 --> 01:22:37.470]  The walls are the thing that compelled Buchanan
[01:22:37.470 --> 01:22:40.470]  to take that child into the port of entry in the first place.
[01:22:40.470 --> 01:22:44.470]  From his vantage point on the night of July 3rd, 2006,
[01:22:44.470 --> 01:22:47.470]  with this poor slave child captive in his van,
[01:22:47.470 --> 01:22:50.470]  he only had one choice, the port of entry.
[01:22:51.470 --> 01:22:53.470]  And that was thanks to the border wall that existed
[01:22:53.470 --> 01:22:55.470]  where he happened to be working his evil works.
[01:22:56.470 --> 01:22:58.470]  Currently, with hundreds of miles of border,
[01:22:58.470 --> 01:23:00.470]  too many traffickers have a choice.
[01:23:00.470 --> 01:23:03.470]  Sadly, we as a nation are providing them that choice.
[01:23:04.470 --> 01:23:07.470]  In the end, the boy was liberated and Buchanan was locked up.
[01:23:07.470 --> 01:23:10.470]  In Lily's case, the traffickers were liberated
[01:23:10.470 --> 01:23:13.470]  and she was locked up and raped thousands of times in New York City.
[01:23:13.470 --> 01:23:17.470]  The difference? The boy had a barrier to save him.
[01:23:17.470 --> 01:23:19.470]  Lily did not.
[01:23:19.470 --> 01:23:22.470]  Paola Felix is a former Mexican congresswoman
[01:23:22.470 --> 01:23:24.470]  and current senior Mexican administration official
[01:23:24.470 --> 01:23:26.470]  working on anti-trafficking policies
[01:23:26.470 --> 01:23:28.470]  for Mexican President Manuel Lopez Obrador.
[01:23:28.470 --> 01:23:32.470]  I work very closely with Paola to find children in Mexico
[01:23:32.470 --> 01:23:35.470]  who are in route to being smuggled into the United States.
[01:23:35.470 --> 01:23:38.470]  Responding to the debate over border barriers,
[01:23:38.470 --> 01:23:40.470]  Felix declared, quote,
[01:23:40.470 --> 01:23:42.470]  It is very disappointing to me that people in the United States
[01:23:42.470 --> 01:23:45.470]  would ignore or downplay the many Hispanic children
[01:23:45.470 --> 01:23:47.470]  being smuggled into the United States
[01:23:47.470 --> 01:23:49.470]  outside of legal ports of entry
[01:23:49.470 --> 01:23:51.470]  and forced into the hell of sex slavery.
[01:23:51.470 --> 01:23:53.470]  Mexican authorities have uncovered
[01:23:53.470 --> 01:23:55.470]  at least 19 different land-based smuggling routes
[01:23:55.470 --> 01:23:58.470]  where victims are taken and trafficked for sex in the United States.
[01:23:58.470 --> 01:24:01.470]  Downplaying the crisis discourages U.S. officials
[01:24:01.470 --> 01:24:04.470]  from employing every tactic available
[01:24:04.470 --> 01:24:07.470]  to rescue them during the small window of time that they can,
[01:24:07.470 --> 01:24:10.470]  that is, while they are being crossed into the United States.
[01:24:10.470 --> 01:24:12.470]  After that, they are gone.
[01:24:12.470 --> 01:24:15.470]  Maybe forever. End quote.
[01:24:15.470 --> 01:24:17.470]  As I conclude my remarks,
[01:24:17.470 --> 01:24:19.470]  please join me in a mental exercise
[01:24:19.470 --> 01:24:22.470]  that I employ often to ground me and focus me.
[01:24:22.470 --> 01:24:25.470]  I imagine that one of my own children
[01:24:25.470 --> 01:24:27.470]  is in the place of one of these child victims.
[01:24:27.470 --> 01:24:29.470]  I have nine children, including two that my wife and I
[01:24:29.470 --> 01:24:31.470]  recently adopted from Haiti
[01:24:31.470 --> 01:24:33.470]  after having liberated them from traffickers,
[01:24:33.470 --> 01:24:35.470]  so it's something easier for me to do,
[01:24:35.470 --> 01:24:37.470]  and I know it's a difficult thing to do,
[01:24:37.470 --> 01:24:38.470]  but please, just for a moment,
[01:24:38.470 --> 01:24:40.470]  please imagine that one of your children,
[01:24:40.470 --> 01:24:42.470]  your grandchildren, nieces, nephews, dear friends
[01:24:42.470 --> 01:24:44.470]  has been kidnapped and is currently in Mexico
[01:24:44.470 --> 01:24:47.470]  being transported north with an evil scheme
[01:24:47.470 --> 01:24:49.470]  to smuggle them into the United States
[01:24:49.470 --> 01:24:51.470]  and force them into these black markets
[01:24:51.470 --> 01:24:53.470]  that we are discussing.
[01:24:53.470 --> 01:24:55.470]  We don't know exactly how the traffickers
[01:24:55.470 --> 01:24:57.470]  plan to get your child in, and it's hypothetical.
[01:24:57.470 --> 01:24:59.470]  That's up to them and only known by them,
[01:24:59.470 --> 01:25:01.470]  but I think it's important to remember the stats
[01:25:01.470 --> 01:25:04.470]  here today that upwards of 90% of the children,
[01:25:04.470 --> 01:25:06.470]  including the unaccompanied minors,
[01:25:06.470 --> 01:25:08.470]  are coming around the ports of entry
[01:25:08.470 --> 01:25:11.470]  in barrier-less parts of the border.
[01:25:11.470 --> 01:25:12.470]  But in this hypothetical, they're coming in,
[01:25:12.470 --> 01:25:14.470]  we don't know where, but they are coming.
[01:25:14.470 --> 01:25:17.470]  And in this hypothetical, before you sits a button
[01:25:17.470 --> 01:25:19.470]  that if pushed instantly creates
[01:25:19.470 --> 01:25:21.470]  a large and powerful barrier
[01:25:21.470 --> 01:25:24.470]  along the entire southern border.
[01:25:24.470 --> 01:25:27.470]  Now picture the hundreds of miles of border that exist,
[01:25:27.470 --> 01:25:29.470]  and picture those ports of entry
[01:25:29.470 --> 01:25:31.470]  full of agents, trained, equipped,
[01:25:31.470 --> 01:25:34.470]  looking for your child, trained to look for your child,
[01:25:34.470 --> 01:25:36.470]  who hopefully is coming through.
[01:25:36.470 --> 01:25:41.470]  And so now the question, do you push the button?
[01:25:41.470 --> 01:25:43.470]  If the answer is yes to that,
[01:25:43.470 --> 01:25:45.470]  then it's very clear what needs to be done next
[01:25:45.470 --> 01:25:46.470]  in our country.
[01:25:46.470 --> 01:25:49.470]  These children, the real children, have nobody.
[01:25:49.470 --> 01:25:52.470]  I know, I've seen them, I've seen dozens of them,
[01:25:52.470 --> 01:25:53.470]  they have nobody.
[01:25:53.470 --> 01:25:56.470]  The only adults in their lives want to sell them,
[01:25:56.470 --> 01:25:58.470]  traffic them, and rape them.
[01:25:58.470 --> 01:26:00.470]  And so we must run to them.
[01:26:00.470 --> 01:26:02.470]  We must be their parents.
[01:26:02.470 --> 01:26:04.470]  If not us, who?
[01:26:04.470 --> 01:26:05.470]  If not this?
[01:26:05.470 --> 01:26:07.470]  All right, very, very powerful testimony,
[01:26:07.470 --> 01:26:09.470]  I'm gonna have it posted on Infowars.com,
[01:26:09.470 --> 01:26:10.470]  the live show feed.
[01:26:10.470 --> 01:26:12.470]  Now that was four years ago.
[01:26:12.470 --> 01:26:15.470]  And Trump basically shut human trafficking down,
[01:26:15.470 --> 01:26:18.470]  95% the Border Patrol estimated.
[01:26:18.470 --> 01:26:20.470]  Remember what Obama did, he said,
[01:26:20.470 --> 01:26:23.470]  if you're a child, you can come here.
[01:26:23.470 --> 01:26:25.470]  Also, if you're accompanied by an adult,
[01:26:25.470 --> 01:26:28.470]  that's the green light for all the human smugglers.
[01:26:28.470 --> 01:26:30.470]  But the Border Patrol got Trump
[01:26:30.470 --> 01:26:32.470]  to get regulations and funding in
[01:26:32.470 --> 01:26:35.470]  that if you didn't have ID, you didn't have info,
[01:26:35.470 --> 01:26:37.470]  it didn't match, you look nothing like these people,
[01:26:37.470 --> 01:26:40.470]  you're two little girls or boys with some weird-looking man,
[01:26:40.470 --> 01:26:41.470]  looks nothing like you,
[01:26:41.470 --> 01:26:44.470]  we're holding you for today, DNA test.
[01:26:44.470 --> 01:26:46.470]  And they can tell if you're a parent, a cousin,
[01:26:46.470 --> 01:26:48.470]  they can tell if you're related.
[01:26:48.470 --> 01:26:50.470]  One month ago, that was ended.
[01:26:50.470 --> 01:26:53.470]  That is, again, literally covering the tracks
[01:26:53.470 --> 01:26:54.470]  for the smugglers.
[01:26:54.470 --> 01:26:55.470]  I have nightmares about this.
[01:26:55.470 --> 01:26:58.470]  I mean, that means the federal government under Biden,
[01:26:58.470 --> 01:27:01.470]  the pedophile, literally is doing this
[01:27:01.470 --> 01:27:04.470]  and doesn't care that the rest of the law enforcement
[01:27:04.470 --> 01:27:05.470]  and courts all know.
[01:27:05.470 --> 01:27:06.470]  They think we're weak.
[01:27:06.470 --> 01:27:08.470]  They think this evil's gonna go on forever.
[01:27:08.470 --> 01:27:10.470]  They think they're unstoppable.
[01:27:10.470 --> 01:27:11.470]  I got news for them.
[01:27:11.470 --> 01:27:14.470]  They have finally awakened the sleeping giant.
[01:27:14.470 --> 01:27:16.470]  Experts say ending DNA testing at the border
[01:27:16.470 --> 01:27:20.470]  will result in more suffering and exploitation.
[01:27:20.470 --> 01:27:21.470]  CBS News.
[01:27:21.470 --> 01:27:26.470]  Biden to end familial DNA testing at US-Mexico border.
[01:27:26.470 --> 01:27:29.470]  Biden-DOJ eliminates language on child sex trafficking
[01:27:29.470 --> 01:27:31.470]  from the government website
[01:27:31.470 --> 01:27:33.470]  and child victims of prostitution
[01:27:33.470 --> 01:27:36.470]  after losing track of 85,000 migrant children.
[01:27:36.470 --> 01:27:39.470]  Again, they let the children go
[01:27:39.470 --> 01:27:41.470]  and they give them to all these random,
[01:27:41.470 --> 01:27:44.470]  unaccredited Democrat Party charities.
[01:27:44.470 --> 01:27:46.470]  And we've been there many times.
[01:27:46.470 --> 01:27:48.470]  And what really hit me with the sound of freedom
[01:27:48.470 --> 01:27:50.470]  was the very first scene.
[01:27:51.470 --> 01:27:53.470]  And the first time I tried to go see it with my wife
[01:27:53.470 --> 01:27:55.470]  on Monday, was it Sunday?
[01:27:55.470 --> 01:27:56.470]  It was Sunday.
[01:27:57.470 --> 01:28:00.470]  She got so upset 30 minutes into it
[01:28:00.470 --> 01:28:02.470]  because it's really frightening and scary.
[01:28:02.470 --> 01:28:04.470]  And these are true stories.
[01:28:04.470 --> 01:28:05.470]  And anybody who's ever been in the store
[01:28:05.470 --> 01:28:06.470]  and you can't find your little kid,
[01:28:06.470 --> 01:28:08.470]  you freak out out of that panic.
[01:28:08.470 --> 01:28:10.470]  I mean, this was like hard to watch.
[01:28:12.470 --> 01:28:14.470]  But they raid this pedophile, they get him,
[01:28:14.470 --> 01:28:16.470]  and they haven't saved one child
[01:28:16.470 --> 01:28:18.470]  that they watch in these videos getting raped.
[01:28:19.470 --> 01:28:21.470]  And there's thousands of them.
[01:28:21.470 --> 01:28:22.470]  These agents have seen thousands of videos
[01:28:22.470 --> 01:28:24.470]  and he says, I can't do this anymore.
[01:28:24.470 --> 01:28:26.470]  He goes, I'm gonna kill myself, basically.
[01:28:26.470 --> 01:28:28.470]  I can't do it.
[01:28:31.470 --> 01:28:33.470]  And he says, okay, I understand.
[01:28:33.470 --> 01:28:34.470]  But that's the problem.
[01:28:34.470 --> 01:28:36.470]  Imagine being the judges and the federal agents
[01:28:36.470 --> 01:28:38.470]  watching Biden just turn the pedophiles loose.
[01:28:38.470 --> 01:28:41.470]  And then if you quit, they completely win.
[01:28:41.470 --> 01:28:42.470]  But if you stay on the job,
[01:28:42.470 --> 01:28:44.470]  you're actually aiding in a weird way.
[01:28:44.470 --> 01:28:45.470]  It's sick.
[01:28:45.470 --> 01:28:46.470]  And that's what evil does.
[01:28:46.470 --> 01:28:48.470]  It puts you in these sick positions.
[01:28:48.470 --> 01:28:49.470]  That's why they had the medical system
[01:28:49.470 --> 01:28:50.470]  give the poison shots.
[01:28:50.470 --> 01:28:51.470]  They didn't know what they were doing.
[01:28:51.470 --> 01:28:52.470]  Now they've corrupted them.
[01:28:52.470 --> 01:28:53.470]  Now they can blame them.
[01:28:53.470 --> 01:28:54.470]  See how it works.
[01:28:54.470 --> 01:28:55.470]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:58.470 --> 01:29:00.470]  The globalists are only humans.
[01:29:00.470 --> 01:29:02.470]  Yeah, they have control of the central banks.
[01:29:02.470 --> 01:29:03.470]  They have a lot of power.
[01:29:03.470 --> 01:29:04.470]  But they can be defeated.
[01:29:04.470 --> 01:29:05.470]  But some of their operations
[01:29:05.470 --> 01:29:07.470]  are gonna take decades to stop.
[01:29:07.470 --> 01:29:09.470]  But one thing you can do right now
[01:29:09.470 --> 01:29:10.470]  is take control of your body
[01:29:10.470 --> 01:29:11.470]  and your family's body
[01:29:11.470 --> 01:29:13.470]  by purifying the water that you drink
[01:29:13.470 --> 01:29:15.470]  and that you cook with
[01:29:15.470 --> 01:29:16.470]  and you do it
[01:29:16.470 --> 01:29:17.470]  with the highest quality
[01:29:17.470 --> 01:29:19.470]  gravity-fed filter out there.
[01:29:19.470 --> 01:29:21.470]  This thing does 10,000 gallons.
[01:29:21.470 --> 01:29:22.470]  You can sit there
[01:29:22.470 --> 01:29:24.470]  and put hundreds of gallons through it a day.
[01:29:24.470 --> 01:29:25.470]  It purifies very quickly
[01:29:25.470 --> 01:29:27.470]  and it cuts out thousands of chemicals
[01:29:27.470 --> 01:29:28.470]  to non-detectable levels.
[01:29:28.470 --> 01:29:29.470]  This is what I use,
[01:29:29.470 --> 01:29:30.470]  which my family uses.
[01:29:30.470 --> 01:29:31.470]  It's the very best system out there
[01:29:31.470 --> 01:29:32.470]  for the lowest price
[01:29:32.470 --> 01:29:33.470]  for a limited time,

[01:29:46.470 --> 01:29:47.470]  Don't procrastinate.
[01:29:47.470 --> 01:29:48.470]  This is one of the main areas
[01:29:48.470 --> 01:29:50.470]  we can take control of our lives
[01:29:50.470 --> 01:29:51.470]  and stop the globalists
[01:29:51.470 --> 01:29:52.470]  from hitting us
[01:29:52.470 --> 01:29:53.470]  with poison that they allow
[01:29:53.470 --> 01:29:54.470]  in the water supply.
[01:29:54.470 --> 01:29:55.470]  In some cases,
[01:29:55.470 --> 01:29:56.470]  they add the water supply
[01:29:56.470 --> 01:29:57.470]  like fluoride.
[01:29:58.470 --> 01:30:00.470]  The globalists aren't just targeting us
[01:30:00.470 --> 01:30:01.470]  through the poison shots
[01:30:01.470 --> 01:30:03.470]  or the electromagnetic 5G
[01:30:03.470 --> 01:30:04.470]  or the GMO crops.
[01:30:04.470 --> 01:30:05.470]  They're hitting us
[01:30:05.470 --> 01:30:06.470]  with hundreds of chemicals
[01:30:06.470 --> 01:30:08.470]  that the EPA has authorized
[01:30:08.470 --> 01:30:10.470]  companies and industry to use.
[01:30:10.470 --> 01:30:13.470]  One of the top pesticides used
[01:30:13.470 --> 01:30:14.470]  is Atrazine.
[01:30:14.470 --> 01:30:15.470]  The allowable level
[01:30:15.470 --> 01:30:16.470]  the government admits
[01:30:16.470 --> 01:30:17.470]  that they allow to be
[01:30:17.470 --> 01:30:18.470]  in your water supply
[01:30:18.470 --> 01:30:19.470]  is enough to sterilize you
[01:30:19.470 --> 01:30:21.470]  and basically turn your son
[01:30:21.470 --> 01:30:23.470]  into a feminized mutant.
[01:30:23.470 --> 01:30:24.470]  Look it up.
[01:30:24.470 --> 01:30:25.470]  Don't let them do this
[01:30:25.470 --> 01:30:26.470]  to your family.
[01:30:26.470 --> 01:30:27.470]  We have the very best
[01:30:27.470 --> 01:30:29.470]  gravity-fed filter system out there.
[01:30:29.470 --> 01:30:30.470]  Highest rated
[01:30:30.470 --> 01:30:31.470]  at half the price
[01:30:31.470 --> 01:30:32.470]  of leading competitors.
[01:30:32.470 --> 01:30:33.470]  The Alexa Pure
[01:30:33.470 --> 01:30:34.470]  ready to ship to you right now.
[01:30:34.470 --> 01:30:35.470]  We have replacement filters
[01:30:35.470 --> 01:30:36.470]  for folks who've already gotten it.
[01:30:36.470 --> 01:30:37.470]  It does 10,000 gallons
[01:30:37.470 --> 01:30:38.470]  before you replace them.
[01:30:38.470 --> 01:30:39.470]  It is amazing.
[01:30:39.470 --> 01:30:40.470]  It's great for your home,
[01:30:40.470 --> 01:30:41.470]  your business.
[01:30:41.470 --> 01:30:42.470]  You can put swamp water in it.
[01:30:42.470 --> 01:30:43.470]  Tap water.
[01:30:43.470 --> 01:30:44.470]  Well water.
[01:30:44.470 --> 01:30:45.470]  Almost everything's contaminated.
[01:30:45.470 --> 01:30:47.470]  This is how you take control
[01:30:47.470 --> 01:30:48.470]  of the fluids in your body
[01:30:48.470 --> 01:30:50.470]  and counter the globalist onslaught.

[01:30:51.470 --> 01:30:52.470]  at Infowarsstore.com
[01:30:52.470 --> 01:30:53.470]  for a limited time.
[01:30:53.470 --> 01:30:54.470]  We're running a 10% discount.
[01:30:54.470 --> 01:30:55.470]  That is a huge discount.
[01:30:55.470 --> 01:30:56.470]  It's probably the lowest
[01:30:56.470 --> 01:30:57.470]  price out there.
[01:30:57.470 --> 01:30:58.470]  You need this filter.
[01:30:58.470 --> 01:31:00.470]  I talk a lot about
[01:31:00.470 --> 01:31:01.470]  the great successes
[01:31:01.470 --> 01:31:02.470]  Infowars has had.
[01:31:02.470 --> 01:31:03.470]  I don't think anybody
[01:31:03.470 --> 01:31:04.470]  can deny it.
[01:31:04.470 --> 01:31:06.470]  And it is because of listeners
[01:31:06.470 --> 01:31:08.470]  and viewers supporting us.
[01:31:08.470 --> 01:31:09.470]  When we talk about
[01:31:09.470 --> 01:31:10.470]  the crew at Infowars,
[01:31:10.470 --> 01:31:11.470]  people behind the scenes,
[01:31:11.470 --> 01:31:12.470]  the researchers,
[01:31:12.470 --> 01:31:13.470]  the writers,
[01:31:13.470 --> 01:31:15.470]  they really have been
[01:31:15.470 --> 01:31:17.470]  the MVPs in this fight.
[01:31:17.470 --> 01:31:18.470]  And when you look
[01:31:18.470 --> 01:31:19.470]  at Harrison Smith
[01:31:19.470 --> 01:31:20.470]  and Owen Schroer
[01:31:20.470 --> 01:31:21.470]  and the hard work
[01:31:21.470 --> 01:31:22.470]  they engage in every day,
[01:31:22.470 --> 01:31:24.470]  five, six, seven days a week,
[01:31:24.470 --> 01:31:26.470]  it's really just incredible.
[01:31:26.470 --> 01:31:27.470]  So for myself
[01:31:27.470 --> 01:31:28.470]  and the whole Infowars crew,
[01:31:28.470 --> 01:31:30.470]  I thank you for your past support.
[01:31:30.470 --> 01:31:31.470]  I only encourage you now
[01:31:31.470 --> 01:31:32.470]  to realize that
[01:31:32.470 --> 01:31:34.470]  Infowars cannot stay on air
[01:31:34.470 --> 01:31:35.470]  if you do not support us.
[01:31:35.470 --> 01:31:36.470]  I know you spread the word.
[01:31:36.470 --> 01:31:37.470]  I know you pray for us.
[01:31:37.470 --> 01:31:38.470]  And that's wonderful.
[01:31:38.470 --> 01:31:39.470]  Keep doing it.
[01:31:39.470 --> 01:31:40.470]  But most viewers and listeners
[01:31:40.470 --> 01:31:42.470]  never go to InfowarsStore.com
[01:31:42.470 --> 01:31:44.470]  and you never buy great products
[01:31:44.470 --> 01:31:45.470]  that enrich and empower your life
[01:31:45.470 --> 01:31:46.470]  while at the same time
[01:31:46.470 --> 01:31:47.470]  keeping us on air.
[01:31:47.470 --> 01:31:49.470]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners
[01:31:49.470 --> 01:31:50.470]  actually go buy products
[01:31:50.470 --> 01:31:51.470]  at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:31:51.470 --> 01:31:53.470]  If just 1% more of you took action
[01:31:53.470 --> 01:31:55.470]  and went to InfowarsStore.com,
[01:31:55.470 --> 01:31:56.470]  our funding problems will be over.
[01:31:56.470 --> 01:31:57.470]  Please take action now.
[01:31:57.470 --> 01:31:59.470]  In the early 1900s,
[01:31:59.470 --> 01:32:01.470]  certain companies were off-gassing
[01:32:01.470 --> 01:32:03.470]  highly toxic fluoride gases
[01:32:03.470 --> 01:32:05.470]  into the atmosphere.
[01:32:05.470 --> 01:32:06.470]  The surrounding communities
[01:32:06.470 --> 01:32:07.470]  began to get sick.
[01:32:07.470 --> 01:32:09.470]  Laws were enacted
[01:32:09.470 --> 01:32:11.470]  to compel these corporations
[01:32:11.470 --> 01:32:12.470]  to install scrubbers
[01:32:12.470 --> 01:32:14.470]  to convert these gases
[01:32:14.470 --> 01:32:16.470]  into fluorosilicic acid.
[01:32:16.470 --> 01:32:17.470]  Still highly toxic,
[01:32:17.470 --> 01:32:18.470]  but containable.
[01:32:18.470 --> 01:32:19.470]  Now these companies
[01:32:19.470 --> 01:32:21.470]  had a stockpile of this poison
[01:32:21.470 --> 01:32:23.470]  and there was no affordable way
[01:32:23.470 --> 01:32:24.470]  to dispose of it.
[01:32:24.470 --> 01:32:25.470]  Lucky for them,
[01:32:25.470 --> 01:32:27.470]  one of their major stockholders
[01:32:27.470 --> 01:32:29.470]  was also the Secretary of the Treasury
[01:32:29.470 --> 01:32:30.470]  who was responsible
[01:32:30.470 --> 01:32:32.470]  for the public health service
[01:32:32.470 --> 01:32:33.470]  at the time.
[01:32:33.470 --> 01:32:34.470]  And by 1950,
[01:32:34.470 --> 01:32:35.470]  the U.S. government
[01:32:35.470 --> 01:32:37.470]  began buying this toxic,
[01:32:37.470 --> 01:32:39.470]  untreated industrial waste product
[01:32:39.470 --> 01:32:40.470]  and dumping it
[01:32:40.470 --> 01:32:41.470]  into our drinking water.
[01:32:41.470 --> 01:32:43.470]  Reputable studies show
[01:32:43.470 --> 01:32:44.470]  that it's causing
[01:32:44.470 --> 01:32:45.470]  various cancers
[01:32:45.470 --> 01:32:46.470]  and other disease.
[01:32:46.470 --> 01:32:48.470]  With the Alexa Pure Pro,
[01:32:48.470 --> 01:32:49.470]  you can have
[01:32:49.470 --> 01:32:50.470]  clean drinking water
[01:32:50.470 --> 01:32:51.470]  and a remedy
[01:32:51.470 --> 01:32:52.470]  to this madness.
[01:32:52.470 --> 01:32:54.470]  Available now
[01:32:54.470 --> 01:32:56.470]  at InfowarsStore.com
[01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:09.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:25.000]  Whether it's CNN, The Washington Post, Rolling Stone,
[01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:31.000]  they all tell you there's no such thing as government involved in child and sex trafficking.
[01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:38.000]  Even though I've got a whole stack of news and it's all over the place about Jeffrey Epstein and the Clintons and the CIA and Mossad and MI6,
[01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:44.000]  why don't they want us talking about that and why are they so upset about the sound of freedom?
[01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:51.000]  One of the things you've been talking about on your show is your allegation that government officials
[01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:56.000]  are aiding in pedophilia, child trafficking, and the grooming of children, right?
[01:33:56.000 --> 01:34:00.000]  What do you mean, like what Jeffrey Epstein did with the Clintons?
[01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:01.000]  Oh!
[01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:02.000]  Oh!
[01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:03.000]  Oh!
[01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:04.000]  Oh!
[01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:05.000]  Oh!
[01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:06.000]  Oh!
[01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:07.000]  Oh!
[01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:08.000]  Oh!
[01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:09.000]  Oh!
[01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:10.000]  Oh!
[01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:11.000]  Oh!
[01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:12.000]  Oh!
[01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:13.000]  Oh!
[01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:14.000]  Oh!
[01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:15.000]  Oh!
[01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:16.000]  Oh!
[01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:17.000]  Oh!
[01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:18.000]  Oh!
[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:19.000]  Oh!
[01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:20.000]  Oh!
[01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:25.000]  So let me finish up with this and give the number out and take your calls.
[01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000]  I'm going to read this again.
[01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:33.000]  The Biden administration has stopped with children without IDs or IDs they can't confirm,
[01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:40.000]  holding them for a day and doing a DNA test to see if this is their parents, grandparents, brothers, sisters, cousins.
[01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:43.000]  It tells them 100% out to like four levels.
[01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:46.000]  Last study I saw, they got different.
[01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:47.000]  The tests get better all the time.
[01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000]  They can tell if you're a fourth cousin of somebody.
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:53.000]  You say, oh, that's my daughter.
[01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:57.000]  World Patrol's like, funny, I don't see any family resemblance, huh?
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:00.000]  Shows here you've been arrested five times smuggling kids before.
[01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:03.000]  Well, this one is my child.
[01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:09.000]  Well, the good news is it's a federal regulation that everybody coming through here that doesn't have IDs that match,
[01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:16.000]  we're going to keep you in a nice facility for a day, give you three meals, and we're going to see.
[01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:24.000]  Oh, hey, it turns out that you don't have any relation to this little girl or little boy.
[01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:29.000]  See, I mean, I could just sit here, just repeat this for like 10 hours on air.
[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:37.000]  Biden just got rid of DNA testing of people with no IDs or improper records at the border with children.
[01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:46.000]  Biden just took off the website, the federal websites of the Justice Department, child sex trafficking and exploitation of children.
[01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000]  I mean, that's been a huge thing forever.
[01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:49.000]  We know this goes on.
[01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:54.000]  Again, it's like saying the Grand Canyon doesn't exist.
[01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:55.000]  Or Niagara Falls.
[01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:58.000]  I mean, it's just insane.
[01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:01.000]  Absolutely evil.
[01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:11.000]  So, flashback, the same MSM trashing Sound of Freedom as QAnon film praise Tim Ballard's Child Rescue 10 years ago.
[01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:16.000]  Yeah, they just covered the stuff nine years ago.
[01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:19.000]  People said, well, why didn't Tim show it all?
[01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:20.000]  How do you do that in a movie?
[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:23.000]  Stalin said one man dies, it's a tragedy.
[01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:24.000]  10,000 dies is a statistic.
[01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:27.000]  I don't like Stalin, but what he said was true.
[01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:30.000]  If they try to like snapshot, then we say this kid, then we say that kid.
[01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000]  It doesn't personalize it.
[01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:38.000]  Real-life Sound of Freedom hero media running interference for pedophiles and human traffickers is sick.
[01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000]  Really think so?
[01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:46.000]  DOJ removes international sex trafficking of minors from website.
[01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:52.000]  40 million opening Sound of Freedom breaks box office.
[01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:58.000]  UK government holds talks with BBC after presenter caught in child sexting scandal.
[01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000]  MSM attacks Sound of Freedom.
[01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:03.000]  Says it's like brain worms.
[01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:07.000]  And it goes on and on.
[01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:12.000]  Oh, here it is back in the day, though, and CBS News and the rest were saying how good it was.
[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:15.000]  Operation Underground Freedom, 6,000 traffic victims rescued.
[01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:20.000]  Rolling Stone again says it's brain worms.
[01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:24.000]  The Sound of Freedom is a superhero movie for dads with brain worms.
[01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:26.000]  Look at this guy.
[01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000]  Wonder what's on his mind today.
[01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000]  It's like a really nice fella, doesn't he?
[01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:39.000]  Wants to come out and attack people that are heroes on record-saving children and child sex dungeons.
[01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:43.000]  What type of person has got the balls, man, to do something like that?
[01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:44.000]  Almost like they're in a cult.
[01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000]  Almost like they're obsessed with something.
[01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000]  Almost like they'll do anything.
[01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:53.000]  And it goes on and on.
[01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:56.000]  Let me show you a few older articles since they say this doesn't exist.
[01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:04.000]  Play that clip from the kangaroo trial last year in Texas, where the judge said I was guilty and said things I didn't do.
[01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:08.000]  And said I had 400 million dollars and would never let me put on a defense.
[01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000]  Because I'd already been found guilty by the judge.
[01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000]  You see people say, why are your lawyers so horrible?
[01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:16.000]  They're not allowed to even say anything except in very narrow confines.
[01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000]  Just enough to make it look like a trial.
[01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:21.000]  And I said to my lawyers, we shouldn't even be a part of this.
[01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:22.000]  We should just boycott this.
[01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:25.000]  They said, yeah, but the public doesn't understand you were defaulted.
[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:26.000]  Now this is a fraud.
[01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:30.000]  We'll be able to get something in there, you know, with the parameters we're given.
[01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:35.000]  And so they felt so protected in this court.
[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:38.000]  That they would do things like this.
[01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:39.000]  Here it is.
[01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:52.000]  One of the things you've been talking about on your show is your allegation that government officials are aiding in pedophilia, child trafficking, and the grooming of children.
[01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:53.000]  Right?
[01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:56.000]  Well, you mean like what Jeffrey Epstein did with the Clintons?
[01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:59.000]  Well, you mean like what Jeffrey Epstein did with the Clintons?
[01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:19.000]  So they've really done a good job over at Google.
[01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:22.000]  Expunging most of it, trying to cover it up.
[01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:29.000]  But if you just go in and type in U.N. sex crimes, U.N. sex trafficking, U.N. pedophilia, children found dead, U.N.
[01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000]  You will still find thousands of articles.
[01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000]  London Guardian, New York Times, you name it.
[01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:37.000]  Of course, you can also find the CIA with the German government.
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:44.000]  30,000 plus children kidnapped, given to convicted pedophiles in Germany by the German government.
[01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000]  Let's put a few of those on screen, guys.
[01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:54.000]  I'll show the New York Post, the New Yorker magazine, excuse me, the New Yorker magazine story.
[01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:57.000]  Which I'm even surprised still the corporate media can report the truth.
[01:39:57.000 --> 01:40:05.000]  I mean, occasionally they're like, oh, look, the government kidnapped 30,000 children plus and gave them to convicted pedophiles and all this.
[01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:11.000]  And let them rape them to create a new culture in Germany starting in the 60s through the 90s.
[01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:16.000]  And one psychiatrist took tens of thousands of kids away, a government psychiatrist, and gave them to pedophiles.
[01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:21.000]  But see, now the new thing is, no, no, no, no, no, that doesn't exist.
[01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000]  That's a conspiracy theory.
[01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:26.000]  Do not, does not, it's not even on the government website.
[01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:30.000]  There's no child exploitation, does not exist, no child labor.
[01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:34.000]  Forget the jungle, forget it all, it doesn't happen.
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:37.000]  Bosnia, the United Nations, human trafficking and prostitution.
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:48.000]  $110,000 payout for a sacked whistleblower that exposed the U.N. kidnapping and raping children.
[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:54.000]  Catholic Church spent $10.6 million to lobby against legislation that would benefit victims of child sex abuse.
[01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:58.000]  The Finder, CIA ties to child sex cult obscured.
[01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:04.000]  More than 100 U.N. peacekeepers ran a child sex ring in Haiti.
[01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:06.000]  None were ever jailed.
[01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:11.000]  AP report, AP documents child sexual abuse by U.N. peacekeepers in Haiti,
[01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:15.000]  including Clinton Foundation officials convicted of kidnapping and smuggling children.
[01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:18.000]  Some used satanic rituals and murdered.
[01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:22.000]  AP investigation, U.N. troops lured kids into Haiti's sex ring.
[01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:26.000]  And so when you want to know when I'm being attacked or people are going after me,
[01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:30.000]  and you see the freak shows attacking us, I'm telling you folks,
[01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:33.000]  you can't swing a stick in the dark and not hit one of these people.
[01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:34.000]  They are emboldened.
[01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:35.000]  They are on the march.
[01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:41.000]  That's why so many Antifa cops know they get a search warrant to an Antifa member's house.
[01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000]  They're going to find pedo porn.
[01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000]  Probably they're producing it.
[01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:48.000]  In fact, every two days, not even looking or so, I see a news article,
[01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:53.000]  but a local one here, a local one there where an Antifa member commits suicide
[01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:58.000]  after child porn and snuff films found on computer.
[01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:04.000]  I mean, so just so you know, you know how I know they're real?
[01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:07.000]  Not just all over the news, experience, witnessing, going to the border,
[01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:11.000]  seeing them smuggle kids myself, seeing them hand over kids with no paperwork.
[01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000]  They just disappear, little babies.
[01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:18.000]  Yeah, there's a Washington Post.
[01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:21.000]  Obama administration placed children with human traffickers knowingly.
[01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:22.000]  Senate report.
[01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:26.000]  But see, that was seven years ago back when there was some soul in the media.
[01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:29.000]  Now the big corporations own and control it all.
[01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000]  Now, no, it doesn't exist.
[01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:32.000]  You saw CNN.
[01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:33.000]  You saw others.
[01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000]  They said, this is not true.
[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:36.000]  It's not happening.
[01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000]  There is not child trafficking, period.
[01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000]  We're the liberals.
[01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:41.000]  AP investigation.
[01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:44.000]  U.N. troops lured kids into Haiti sex ring.
[01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:47.000]  Oxfam is tied to it all.
[01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:48.000]  Big U.N. charities.
[01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000]  And they keep going on.
[01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:51.000]  Bosnia sex slavery.
[01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:52.000]  African slavery.
[01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:53.000]  You want me to keep going here?
[01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:54.000]  I'll be right back.
[01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:55.000]  I'll be right back.
[01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:56.000]  Stay with us.
[01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:03.000]  Infowarsstore.com is like a grocery store or like a vitamin shop.
[01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000]  We want to have all the best brands for you.
[01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000]  We want to have a bunch of different choices for you.
[01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000]  So I get constant questions online and in person.
[01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:10.000]  Hey, what's better?
[01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:11.000]  Knockout.
[01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:12.000]  What's better?
[01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:13.000]  Down and out.
[01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:14.000]  What's better?
[01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:21.000]  And the answer is different herbal formulas, different compounds are better for different people.
[01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000]  So one person might like this coffee.
[01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000]  Another person likes that coffee.
[01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:27.000]  That's how our bodies work.
[01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:28.000]  They're all very diverse.
[01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:34.000]  But we've been able to private label a national bestseller that's been sold for many years that people love.
[01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:39.000]  And sold for a lower price under the name Infowars MD Good Night Sleep.
[01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:42.000]  This is a great formula full of amazing safe compounds.
[01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:45.000]  Give you deeper, cleaner, restful sleep.
[01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:49.000]  And it's in stock available right now of 25% off out of the gates.
[01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:52.000]  So get your Infowars MD Good Night Sleep today.
[01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:53.000]  Infowars.com
[01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000]  Infowars became the biggest company in the last six.
[01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:27.000]  They went out, hired engineers, reverse engineered the fancy best water filter system out there that sells for twice the price.
[01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:30.000]  And they made it as good in all the studies.
[01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:33.000]  It reduces things to non-detectable levels, thousands of chemicals.
[01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000]  But you can go pay two or three times.
[01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:38.000]  There's four or five other filters out there that are just as good.
[01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:43.000]  We sell the very best highest grade water filtration system for half the price of the leading competitor.
[01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:48.000]  And the media says we're bad and a cult for telling you you should filter your water.
[01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000]  You should also filter your shower water.
[01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000]  That's another way you absorb this crap.
[01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:53.000]  But I'm done talking about that.
[01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:56.000]  The point is you get the filters at Infowars.com.
[01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:57.000]  They're discounted right now.
[01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:58.000]  Finally back in stock.
[01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000]  I want to say brain force is great.
[01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000]  I want to say turbo force is amazing.
[01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:08.000]  It is.
[01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:12.000]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000]  The fish oil is better than that.
[01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000]  Fish oil is liquid energy.
[01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:21.000]  Brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000]  Krill oil is the best.
[01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:24.000]  And it'll give you the damn burps.
[01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:25.000]  And I'm sorry.
[01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:26.000]  You want something like this?
[01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:27.000]  You don't get stuff for free.
[01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:30.000]  It's so good in my view.
[01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:31.000]  I'm not making a medical statement here.
[01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:32.000]  But let me tell you something.
[01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:35.000]  And I eat five capulets of krill oil before I go to bed.
[01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:43.000]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000]  So we don't make a big profit off of it.
[01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:49.000]  But you notice I just obsess.
[01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:52.000]  Because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:53.000]  I just can't do it.
[01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000]  Infowarsstore.com
[01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000]  Two amazing nootropics.
[01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000]  That means brain power.
[01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000]  Are back in stock at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:07.000]  And they're both 50% off.
[01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:11.000]  We haven't offered these for 50% off since last Christmas.
[01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000]  These are amazing products.
[01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000]  And for those of you on the fence, I want you to try them.
[01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000]  Brain Force Ultra hits in 15 minutes.
[01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:20.000]  Only lasts three hours with no hangover.
[01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:21.000]  It is a game changer.
[01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000]  Nobody's got something close to this.
[01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:27.000]  Then our Brain Force Plus is a good, basic, clean nootropic.
[01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000]  Gives you four to six hours of amazing energy.
[01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000]  Again, with no hangover, no jitters.
[01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000]  Both products back in stock.
[01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:36.000]  Infowarsstore.com for 50% off.
[01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:37.000]  And it funds the Infowar.
[01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:41.000]  So get your Brain Force Ultra, your Brain Force Plus, and your Turbo Force.
[01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:44.000]  All exclusively at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:49.000]  And know, you're funding the second American Revolution, 1776 worldwide.
[01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:53.000]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:56.000]  And the answer for energy is Brain Force.
[01:46:57.680 --> 01:47:07.680]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:08.530 --> 01:47:21.530]  All right, here's what I want to do.
[01:47:21.530 --> 01:47:27.530]  There's blood on the streets, it's up to my ankles.
[01:47:27.530 --> 01:47:31.530]  There's blood in the streets, it's up to my ankles.
[01:47:31.530 --> 01:47:35.530]  There's blood in the streets, it's up to my knees.
[01:47:35.530 --> 01:47:39.530]  There's blood in the streets, the town of Chicago.
[01:47:39.530 --> 01:47:44.530]  All right, I want to open the phones up, and I want to talk specifically about the Sound of Freedom.
[01:47:44.530 --> 01:47:46.530]  Have you seen it?
[01:47:46.530 --> 01:47:50.530]  When I just played that one CNN clip, because it's so nauseating, I've seen dozens of them.
[01:47:50.530 --> 01:47:57.530]  You have, too. MSNBC, ABC, CBS, just saying, no, it's not true, they're exaggerating,
[01:47:57.530 --> 01:48:02.530]  there is no child trafficking, or it's not that bad, because they've totally opened the border up
[01:48:02.530 --> 01:48:07.530]  and they're just flooding it with children for slave labor, organ harvesting, sex.
[01:48:07.530 --> 01:48:09.530]  They're finding dead bodies of children.
[01:48:09.530 --> 01:48:13.530]  I mean, they'll open up a tractor trail, there'll be 40 dead bodies, 50 dead bodies.
[01:48:13.530 --> 01:48:17.530]  Just every day they find some dead toddler in a cornfield in South Texas.
[01:48:17.530 --> 01:48:24.530]  I mean, and then finally it comes out in court, but no media covers that the baby had been raped 100 times.
[01:48:24.530 --> 01:48:31.530]  And you hear Ballard talking about some little girls that have been kidnapped being raped 30 times a day.
[01:48:31.530 --> 01:48:34.530]  The average is like 15.
[01:48:34.530 --> 01:48:42.530]  Amnesty International found 80% of women and young girls being brought across the Texas-Mexico border are raped.
[01:48:45.530 --> 01:48:51.530]  But where is Robert Rodriguez when he makes a movie like Machete where the white people, Don Johnson,
[01:48:51.530 --> 01:48:55.530]  is down there shooting pregnant Hispanic women in the belly?
[01:48:55.530 --> 01:49:00.530]  No, it's not racial, other than people, I guess, don't think Hispanics deserve the same support as other people.
[01:49:00.530 --> 01:49:02.530]  I think they deserve just as much.
[01:49:05.530 --> 01:49:09.530]  Oh, it's white people and black people and brown people, but it's elites, it's rich.
[01:49:09.530 --> 01:49:15.530]  Oh, there are some white guys raping little Hispanic girls, but see, Rodriguez doesn't make a show about that.
[01:49:15.530 --> 01:49:22.530]  He makes a show about Don Johnson going, I'm in the KKK and I'm going to shoot a pregnant woman in the belly.
[01:49:22.530 --> 01:49:25.530]  That's not going on down there, other than the cartels.
[01:49:31.530 --> 01:49:38.530]  But, yeah, here it is, here's Don Johnson, an imaginary crime, an imaginary racial division.
[01:49:38.530 --> 01:49:42.530]  Instead of humanizing white children, brown children, black children, yellow children, red children.
[01:49:44.530 --> 01:49:52.530]  Instead of humanizing and stopping the trafficking, no, no, they make keeping the trafficking going good to stop Don Johnson that wants to stop it.
[01:49:52.530 --> 01:49:56.530]  So there really are no guys in cowboy hats shooting pregnant Hispanic women in the stomach.
[01:49:56.530 --> 01:49:58.530]  That's not going on.
[01:50:00.530 --> 01:50:03.530]  I'm not saying the whole history of the crazy border, that hadn't happened once or twice.
[01:50:03.530 --> 01:50:07.530]  But the idea that this is going on on a routine basis is preposterous.
[01:50:07.530 --> 01:50:12.530]  What is going on is giant, massive human trafficking.
[01:50:15.530 --> 01:50:17.530]  And the media is covering it up.
[01:50:17.530 --> 01:50:22.530]  And that's why he's funded by Obama and other people that work for him that brag about it.
[01:50:22.530 --> 01:50:26.530]  His job was to create racial division, he was under the direct command of Obama.
[01:50:27.530 --> 01:50:29.530]  Where is he now?
[01:50:30.530 --> 01:50:32.530]  He knows exactly what he's doing.
[01:50:32.530 --> 01:50:35.530]  Robert Rodriguez is a shameful, disgusting person.
[01:50:36.530 --> 01:50:41.530]  Imagine if he made films about human trafficking and how we need to save these children and stop this.
[01:50:42.530 --> 01:50:46.530]  He could have saved hundreds of thousands of people's futures.
[01:50:46.530 --> 01:50:47.530]  Nope.
[01:50:47.530 --> 01:50:53.530]  Take money from Obama so he makes movies about white people in fantasy land murdering Hispanic women.
[01:50:55.530 --> 01:50:57.530]  So I'm going to take your calls on this.
[01:50:58.530 --> 01:51:00.530]  And where do you think this is going?
[01:51:00.530 --> 01:51:03.530]  But I believe it's going to be a slower burn but a bigger explosion.
[01:51:03.530 --> 01:51:08.530]  If you think Dylan Mulvaney destroying Anheuser-Busch, 30-something billion now,
[01:51:08.530 --> 01:51:11.530]  Target picking up on it, going here, hold my beer,
[01:51:11.530 --> 01:51:15.530]  showing devil worship and we're going to recruit your kids to Satan,
[01:51:15.530 --> 01:51:19.530]  and we're going to turn them into skeletons, and we're going to cut Christians' heads off.
[01:51:19.530 --> 01:51:30.530]  And then by the way, I was on the street by a LGBTQ ass parade, Satan parade,
[01:51:30.530 --> 01:51:35.530]  and I got photos of some of it, and a lot of people were wearing Satanic attire.
[01:51:35.530 --> 01:51:39.530]  And I just was like, saw it real quick, saw the Target clothes,
[01:51:39.530 --> 01:51:44.530]  and then ducked into the hotel I was at visiting my wife's dad who was in the hospital a few weeks ago.
[01:51:44.530 --> 01:51:45.530]  I got the photo.
[01:51:45.530 --> 01:51:46.530]  I think you guys probably still have it in there.
[01:51:46.530 --> 01:51:47.530]  If not, I'll send it to you again.
[01:51:47.530 --> 01:51:54.530]  And he's got the rainbow saying not Pride Month but Pride Demon Month,
[01:51:54.530 --> 01:51:57.530]  and with a devil with a pitchfork.
[01:51:57.530 --> 01:51:59.530]  And I mean that's really what this is.
[01:51:59.530 --> 01:52:03.530]  It's LGBTP-S.
[01:52:03.530 --> 01:52:07.530]  The PS on the end of the LGBT plus is pedophile Satanist.
[01:52:07.530 --> 01:52:10.530]  And I'm serious.
[01:52:10.530 --> 01:52:13.530]  And you're like, well, they haven't fully taken the government over.
[01:52:13.530 --> 01:52:20.530]  They're literally saying this stuff doesn't exist and this movie's bad.
[01:52:20.530 --> 01:52:23.530]  Talk about jumping the shark.
[01:52:23.530 --> 01:52:33.530]  Toll-free number to join us, 877-789-2539, 877-789-2539, 877-789-Alex.
[01:52:33.530 --> 01:52:35.530]  We're taking first-time callers.
[01:52:35.530 --> 01:52:36.530]  We're taking long-time callers.
[01:52:36.530 --> 01:52:41.530]  We're calling callers that disagree, callers that agree, callers that got questions.
[01:52:41.530 --> 01:52:50.530]  All I ask is it be on the subject of human trafficking, men, women, and children.
[01:52:50.530 --> 01:52:53.530]  And what do you make of the system?
[01:52:53.530 --> 01:52:59.530]  Because them trying to cram crazy men in women's dresses saying they have periods
[01:52:59.530 --> 01:53:04.530]  and that they are the example of womanhood and giving men all the pageant awards
[01:53:04.530 --> 01:53:09.530]  and all this rubbing our faces in it to destroy the sexes in our culture
[01:53:09.530 --> 01:53:15.530]  and to depopulate us, which is their admitted plan, has totally backfired on them.
[01:53:15.530 --> 01:53:20.530]  And now the attack on the sound of freedom that everybody should go see
[01:53:20.530 --> 01:53:23.530]  and saying it's bad and it's not real and it's evil and it's not good.
[01:53:23.530 --> 01:53:28.530]  I mean, again, every major leftist channel up one side, down the other.
[01:53:28.530 --> 01:53:29.530]  You have to hide under a rock.
[01:53:29.530 --> 01:53:31.530]  We've written a bunch of articles on M4s about it.
[01:53:31.530 --> 01:53:35.530]  Do you want me to play the clips of them saying this is ridiculous, this isn't true,
[01:53:35.530 --> 01:53:38.530]  this is maggots in your brain, this is imaginary?
[01:53:38.530 --> 01:53:40.530]  Don't worry about sex trafficking.
[01:53:40.530 --> 01:53:42.530]  These people want to imagine they're heroes.
[01:53:42.530 --> 01:53:44.530]  They want to imagine they're helping people.
[01:53:44.530 --> 01:53:50.530]  Every few days we hear about another tractor trailer where the drug cartels
[01:53:50.530 --> 01:53:54.530]  just lock them up in the heat and they all die inside of it, including a bunch of children.
[01:53:54.530 --> 01:53:56.530]  Care about them?
[01:53:56.530 --> 01:53:57.530]  No.
[01:53:57.530 --> 01:53:59.530]  The left doesn't care about real numbers.
[01:53:59.530 --> 01:54:01.530]  They want to abort babies.
[01:54:01.530 --> 01:54:02.530]  They want to sterilize children.
[01:54:02.530 --> 01:54:04.530]  They want to cut your daughter's breast off.
[01:54:04.530 --> 01:54:06.530]  They want to cut your son's genitals off.
[01:54:06.530 --> 01:54:07.530]  They want you to take drugs.
[01:54:07.530 --> 01:54:09.530]  They want you to be unhappy.
[01:54:09.530 --> 01:54:10.530]  I've got articles here today.
[01:54:10.530 --> 01:54:14.530]  They're back at it again saying exercise is white supremacist.
[01:54:14.530 --> 01:54:17.530]  Pandemic fitness trendies have gone extreme.
[01:54:17.530 --> 01:54:20.530]  White supremacist latest scheme.
[01:54:20.530 --> 01:54:24.530]  Pandemic fitness trends have gone extreme.
[01:54:24.530 --> 01:54:25.530]  MSNBC.
[01:54:25.530 --> 01:54:26.530]  White supremacism.
[01:54:26.530 --> 01:54:29.530]  Fitness fascism.
[01:54:29.530 --> 01:54:32.530]  Look at this one.
[01:54:32.530 --> 01:54:34.530]  This is The Nation.
[01:54:35.530 --> 01:54:40.530]  Asian-Americans and conservatives have become key allies in white supremacy.
[01:54:40.530 --> 01:54:46.530]  Key allies in white supremacy.
[01:54:46.530 --> 01:54:48.530]  Where's the grand dragon?
[01:54:48.530 --> 01:54:50.530]  Oh, Chung Choi is here.
[01:54:50.530 --> 01:54:53.530]  Seriously.
[01:54:53.530 --> 01:54:55.530]  Chung Lu is here.
[01:54:55.530 --> 01:54:57.530]  Where is the main white supremacist?
[01:54:57.530 --> 01:54:58.530]  Here he is.
[01:54:58.530 --> 01:54:59.530]  He's right here.
[01:54:59.530 --> 01:55:02.530]  I mean, this is upside down world.
[01:55:02.530 --> 01:55:07.530]  But the same folks that tell us two men can have a baby.
[01:55:07.530 --> 01:55:09.530]  Where do you see all this going?
[01:55:09.530 --> 01:55:10.530]  Continuing.
[01:55:10.530 --> 01:55:11.530]  Bosnia.
[01:55:11.530 --> 01:55:12.530]  The United Nations.
[01:55:12.530 --> 01:55:14.530]  Human trafficking and prostitution.
[01:55:14.530 --> 01:55:17.530]  You'll want to look up that whole saga.
[01:55:17.530 --> 01:55:22.530]  Up close to a crisp million the UN smuggled out of there the last 20 years.
[01:55:22.530 --> 01:55:28.530]  And it just goes on and on and on and on.
[01:55:28.530 --> 01:55:33.530]  Has the UN learned lessons of Bosnian sex slavery revealed?
[01:55:33.530 --> 01:55:35.530]  London Guardian.
[01:55:35.530 --> 01:55:37.530]  But see, that was 11 years ago.
[01:55:37.530 --> 01:55:38.530]  It was okay to talk about it.
[01:55:38.530 --> 01:55:41.530]  And now it just does not exist.
[01:55:41.530 --> 01:55:44.530]  Queue up that CNN clip from the Ballard clip.
[01:55:44.530 --> 01:55:45.530]  Because we've got the full CNN clip.
[01:55:45.530 --> 01:55:48.530]  But just that short clip that Ballard responded to.
[01:55:48.530 --> 01:55:50.530]  Where they just say it's fantasy land.
[01:55:50.530 --> 01:55:53.530]  It's manipulating statistics.
[01:55:53.530 --> 01:55:59.530]  French peacekeepers allegedly tied up girls and forced them into bestiality.
[01:55:59.530 --> 01:56:01.530]  NATO forces feeds Kosovo sex trade.
[01:56:01.530 --> 01:56:02.530]  The Guardian.
[01:56:02.530 --> 01:56:04.530]  But see, that was 2004.
[01:56:04.530 --> 01:56:06.530]  You're not allowed to talk about it now.
[01:56:06.530 --> 01:56:07.530]  It doesn't exist.
[01:56:07.530 --> 01:56:09.530]  I mean, you've seen me in court.
[01:56:09.530 --> 01:56:11.530]  It's like, it's a bad thing in front of a jury.
[01:56:11.530 --> 01:56:14.530]  Like, this man believes there's child sex slavery.
[01:56:14.530 --> 01:56:17.530]  Everybody's like, oh, that's what bad men think.
[01:56:17.530 --> 01:56:21.530]  Oh, the Austin jury's like, you think people rape kids?
[01:56:21.530 --> 01:56:23.530]  Well, I mean, we cut their penises off.
[01:56:23.530 --> 01:56:24.530]  But what's wrong with that?
[01:56:24.530 --> 01:56:27.530]  We're liberal.
[01:56:27.530 --> 01:56:31.530]  This man claims the state wants to cut your son's penis off.
[01:56:31.530 --> 01:56:32.530]  Well, we do.
[01:56:32.530 --> 01:56:34.530]  That's beautiful.
[01:56:34.530 --> 01:56:37.530]  It's beautiful what we do.
[01:56:37.530 --> 01:56:39.530]  Listen to Rachel Levin.
[01:56:39.530 --> 01:56:41.530]  She's an admiral.
[01:56:41.530 --> 01:56:43.530]  And a beautiful woman.
[01:56:43.530 --> 01:56:48.530]  Ready to star in a horror movie with no makeup needed.
[01:56:48.530 --> 01:56:51.530]  U.N. peacekeeping has a sexual abuse problem.
[01:56:51.530 --> 01:56:53.530]  Hmm.
[01:56:53.530 --> 01:56:57.530]  U.K. says grotesque charity sex abuse scandal.
[01:56:57.530 --> 01:56:58.530]  There's a wake-up call.
[01:56:58.530 --> 01:56:59.530]  Reuters.
[01:56:59.530 --> 01:57:02.530]  Jimmy Savelle, best friend of the king.
[01:57:02.530 --> 01:57:04.530]  Caught with underground sex dungeon.
[01:57:04.530 --> 01:57:06.530]  Caught having sex with dead children.
[01:57:06.530 --> 01:57:07.530]  AP exclusive.
[01:57:07.530 --> 01:57:12.530]  U.N. child sex left victims but no arrests.
[01:57:12.530 --> 01:57:20.530]  Watch dad fumes as doctor asks seven and nine-year-old sons what gender they are.
[01:57:20.530 --> 01:57:22.530]  But there's some good news.
[01:57:22.530 --> 01:57:29.530]  Sixth circuit allows Tennessee ban on transgender surgery for minors to go into effect.
[01:57:29.530 --> 01:57:35.530]  How dare them not give life-affirming care to use a mentally ill, brainwashed, autistic child
[01:57:35.530 --> 01:57:38.530]  that the state's convinced to have their genitals cut off.
[01:57:38.530 --> 01:57:41.530]  No, we're going to save you, young lady.
[01:57:41.530 --> 01:57:45.530]  We're going to cut that feminine penis right off.
[01:57:48.530 --> 01:57:53.530]  With all the craziness in the world, the collapsing borders, the war with Russia,
[01:57:53.530 --> 01:57:57.530]  the insanity, the currency devaluations, the economy going crazy,
[01:57:57.530 --> 01:58:03.530]  you are crazy, in my view, if you don't get high-quality, storable food and water filtration and self-defense.
[01:58:03.530 --> 01:58:05.530]  Now, we're not selling guns and ammo.
[01:58:05.530 --> 01:58:08.530]  That's for you to go out and get for yourself and learn how to use if you haven't.
[01:58:08.530 --> 01:58:10.530]  And I'm preaching to the choir on that.
[01:58:10.530 --> 01:58:14.530]  A lot of people got plenty of guns, but they don't have enough storable food or water filtration.
[01:58:14.530 --> 01:58:16.530]  This is something you need now.
[01:58:16.530 --> 01:58:20.530]  And we've got it in the food department and in the high-quality water filtration department.
[01:58:20.530 --> 01:58:26.530]  The highest quality food, the best water filtration at the lowest prices you're going to find and still get quality.
[01:58:26.530 --> 01:58:34.530]  Infowarsstore.com is running a special right now for 10% off on all storable food and on water and air filtration.
[01:58:34.530 --> 01:58:37.530]  Ladies and gentlemen, you cannot beat this deal.
[01:58:37.530 --> 01:58:38.530]  Our prices are already the lowest.
[01:58:38.530 --> 01:58:41.530]  At 10% off, it's an insane deal for a limited time.
[01:58:41.530 --> 01:58:45.530]  Go to Infowarsstore.com and get prepared while you still can.
[01:58:48.530 --> 01:58:52.530]  You're going to want to pay attention to what I'm about to say in the next 60 seconds.
[01:58:52.530 --> 01:58:57.530]  Two new incredible products are now available exclusively at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:58:57.530 --> 01:59:04.530]  They are both clones of national best-selling products from a major pharmaceutical-slash-supplement maker
[01:59:04.530 --> 01:59:10.530]  that are listeners and patriots, that are allowing us to private label it at a lower price you'll find in stores.
[01:59:10.530 --> 01:59:14.530]  It's Joint Relief Max and Nerve Renew.
[01:59:14.530 --> 01:59:22.530]  Both of these have known documented natural compounds to lower pain and to also make your nerves healthier,
[01:59:22.530 --> 01:59:27.530]  which is one of the major reasons nerves get irritated and are more inductive to pain.
[01:59:27.530 --> 01:59:29.530]  There's major research behind this all.
[01:59:29.530 --> 01:59:39.530]  You need to get Joint Relief Max from Infowars MD and Nerve Renew from Infowars MD exclusively at Infowarsstore.com right now.
[01:59:39.530 --> 01:59:41.530]  Introducing them both, 25% off.
[01:59:41.530 --> 01:59:46.530]  You'll find them exclusively at Infowarsstore.com, and they fund our operation.
[01:59:51.530 --> 01:59:56.530]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:59:58.780 --> 02:00:02.780]  John the Revelator
[02:00:03.780 --> 02:00:08.780]  John the Revelator told us 2,000 plus years ago about a planetary world government
[02:00:08.780 --> 02:00:13.780]  that would create a beast system we had to worship and follow or we couldn't buy or sell.
[02:00:13.780 --> 02:00:16.780]  We would have a digital mark on our hand and forehead.
[02:00:16.780 --> 02:00:18.780]  Now it's all come true.
[02:00:18.780 --> 02:00:20.780]  That's why Depeche Mode says he's a fraud.
[02:00:22.780 --> 02:00:26.780]  Yeah, if somebody gives you the winning lottery tickets ten times in a row, they're bad.
[02:00:27.780 --> 02:00:29.780]  When somebody's accurate, that's when they're a fraud.
[02:00:29.780 --> 02:00:30.780]  Just like me.
[02:00:30.780 --> 02:00:34.780]  I'm not saying I'm John the Revelator, but definitely a close ten thousands.
[02:00:35.780 --> 02:00:36.780]  Crank it up.
[02:00:45.780 --> 02:00:47.780]  Let's put something else on while we're playing this.
[02:00:47.780 --> 02:00:49.780]  I'm pretty ridiculous looking at Lex Luthor now.
[02:00:51.780 --> 02:00:53.780]  Alright, let's get serious here.
[02:00:53.780 --> 02:00:57.780]  The thing I need to get serious about is this.
[02:01:02.780 --> 02:01:03.780]  You got to love Depeche Mode.
[02:01:03.780 --> 02:01:06.780]  It's great sounding music, but so badly written.
[02:01:08.780 --> 02:01:11.780]  Imagine John the Revelator stealing his God from the Muslims.
[02:01:14.780 --> 02:01:18.780]  The Muslims didn't exist for 400 and something years after John the Revelator.
[02:01:19.780 --> 02:01:25.780]  So, it's like saying the Wright Brothers stole flight from Lockheed Martin.
[02:01:27.780 --> 02:01:28.780]  Look, I'm digressing.
[02:01:28.780 --> 02:01:29.780]  We got loaded phone lines.
[02:01:29.780 --> 02:01:38.780]  Nick and Joshua and Stacy and Peter and Carlos and Jackson and Paris and Jared and Victor and Eben and Carlos.
[02:01:38.780 --> 02:01:42.780]  We're going to take all your phone calls one after the other and we start the next segment.
[02:01:44.780 --> 02:01:47.780]  But I've not gotten to a bunch of those newscasts I told you about.
[02:01:48.780 --> 02:01:51.780]  Dealing with just constant pedo bust going on around the country.
[02:01:51.780 --> 02:02:01.780]  And that when you see these stories break, you very rarely see any news coverage of it.
[02:02:01.780 --> 02:02:03.780]  So, let's play back to back here real quick.
[02:02:07.780 --> 02:02:08.780]  You know what, let's wait for the next segment.
[02:02:08.780 --> 02:02:11.780]  Some Stacy is joining us because I'm going to come back, play this and go to your calls.
[02:02:11.780 --> 02:02:14.780]  Because first I want to play CNN saying this doesn't exist.
[02:02:15.780 --> 02:02:20.780]  And then I've got a whole bunch of local newscasts just this week with this stuff going on.
[02:02:20.780 --> 02:02:22.780]  And everybody knows about this stuff.
[02:02:22.780 --> 02:02:30.780]  Everybody knows about sex trafficking and the pimps and the kidnapped kids and how the Latin Americans have been caught in all the Veritas reports.
[02:02:30.780 --> 02:02:35.780]  And the admissions and the sex crime statistics in the Senate report that Obama knowingly placed them with them.
[02:02:35.780 --> 02:02:36.780]  We already showed you that.
[02:02:36.780 --> 02:02:39.780]  But just imagine because I can't get over it.
[02:02:39.780 --> 02:02:40.780]  I'll be completely honest with you.
[02:02:41.780 --> 02:02:44.780]  Let's play the CNN clip going out to break.
[02:02:44.780 --> 02:02:45.780]  We'll come back with the other clip.
[02:02:45.780 --> 02:02:49.780]  I just can't imagine that we're actually in this place.
[02:02:49.780 --> 02:02:51.780]  I keep pinching myself at this point.
[02:02:51.780 --> 02:02:52.780]  Even Alex Jones can't believe it.
[02:02:52.780 --> 02:03:00.780]  And I'm like, I've got dozens of clips of corporate media saying don't watch the movie and it's lies.
[02:03:00.780 --> 02:03:02.780]  And nobody wants to kidnap your kid.
[02:03:02.780 --> 02:03:05.780]  And meanwhile, I'm a news hound.
[02:03:05.780 --> 02:03:09.780]  So, I look at the news all day and I see child kidnapped here, child kidnapped there, child found here.
[02:03:09.780 --> 02:03:12.780]  Child found here in a hotel right by dozens of men.
[02:03:12.780 --> 02:03:13.780]  Child found dead.
[02:03:13.780 --> 02:03:16.780]  And I'm sitting there and it's only in local news.
[02:03:16.780 --> 02:03:18.780]  So, again, why is that not national news?
[02:03:18.780 --> 02:03:25.780]  Sometimes the national news will choose some little girl that goes missing and then they'll make it the biggest story ever.
[02:03:25.780 --> 02:03:27.780]  They'll focus you on that one.
[02:03:27.780 --> 02:03:29.780]  Meanwhile, there's millions.
[02:03:29.780 --> 02:03:32.780]  And it just makes you think, how big is this underground of pedophiles?
[02:03:32.780 --> 02:03:35.780]  I mean, how many of these people are there?
[02:03:35.780 --> 02:03:37.780]  And I think it's a pretty big army.
[02:03:37.780 --> 02:03:38.780]  They're pretty confident now.
[02:03:38.780 --> 02:03:40.780]  Look at drag queen pedo time.
[02:03:40.780 --> 02:03:41.780]  Look at all of it.
[02:03:41.780 --> 02:03:42.780]  Look at Disney.
[02:03:42.780 --> 02:03:43.780]  Look at all the Disney executives.
[02:03:43.780 --> 02:03:45.780]  They're convicted pedophiles.
[02:03:45.780 --> 02:03:47.780]  They rehire rapists of children.
[02:03:47.780 --> 02:03:49.780]  Here's a clip.
[02:03:49.780 --> 02:03:52.780]  These films are created out of moral panics.
[02:03:52.780 --> 02:03:54.780]  They're created out of bogus statistics.
[02:03:54.780 --> 02:03:56.780]  They're created out of fear.
[02:03:56.780 --> 02:04:06.780]  And with something like Sound of Freedom, it specifically is looking at QAnon concepts of these child trafficking rings that are run by the high-level elites and only people like Tim Ballard
[02:04:06.780 --> 02:04:13.780]  and only people like Jim Caviezel and, by extension, only people like the ticket buyer can help bring these trafficking rings down.
[02:04:13.780 --> 02:04:20.780]  But if you buy an electric car that's super toxic and has slave mines, you're saving the earth, though.
[02:04:20.780 --> 02:04:25.780]  But we're bad saying there's human trafficking when the Texas border and others have totally collapsed with Mexico.
[02:04:25.780 --> 02:04:28.780]  And it's just a pell-mell human trafficking nightmare down there.
[02:04:28.780 --> 02:04:29.780]  Go look.
[02:04:29.780 --> 02:04:32.780]  We got a little smarmy guy there.
[02:04:32.780 --> 02:04:35.780]  Look, I'm not saying he's not qualified.
[02:04:35.780 --> 02:04:38.780]  In fact, if I need a babysitter, I'm going to call that guy.
[02:04:38.780 --> 02:04:41.780]  Hey, will you come by and watch my babies for me?
[02:04:41.780 --> 02:04:49.780]  I really think you're – him and Brian Stelter should start a daycare center together because they'll save our kids, right?
[02:04:49.780 --> 02:04:50.780]  That's right.
[02:04:50.780 --> 02:04:53.780]  What a nice young man.
[02:04:53.780 --> 02:04:55.780]  He's very proud of himself.
[02:04:55.780 --> 02:04:56.780]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:56.780 --> 02:04:58.780]  Stay with us.
[02:04:58.780 --> 02:05:00.780]  The globalists are only humans.
[02:05:00.780 --> 02:05:02.780]  Yeah, they have control of the central banks.
[02:05:02.780 --> 02:05:03.780]  They have a lot of power.
[02:05:03.780 --> 02:05:04.780]  But they can be defeated.
[02:05:04.780 --> 02:05:07.780]  But some of their operations are going to take decades to stop.
[02:05:07.780 --> 02:05:15.780]  But one thing you can do right now is take control of your body and your family's body by purifying the water that you drink and that you cook with.
[02:05:15.780 --> 02:05:19.780]  And you do it with the highest quality gravity-fed filter out there.
[02:05:19.780 --> 02:05:21.780]  This thing does 10,000 gallons.
[02:05:21.780 --> 02:05:24.780]  You can sit there and put hundreds of gallons through it a day.
[02:05:24.780 --> 02:05:29.780]  It purifies very quickly, and it cuts out thousands of chemicals to non-detectable levels.
[02:05:29.780 --> 02:05:31.780]  This is what I use, which my family uses.
[02:05:31.780 --> 02:05:33.780]  It's the very best system out there for the lowest price.
[02:05:33.780 --> 02:05:36.780]  For a limited time, 10% off on top of that.
[02:05:36.780 --> 02:05:41.780]  Exclusively at InfowarStore.com on the Alexa Pure water filtration system.
[02:05:41.780 --> 02:05:45.780]  In stock and replacement filters for folks that need those in stock.

[02:05:47.780 --> 02:05:48.780]  Don't procrastinate.
[02:05:48.780 --> 02:05:55.780]  This is one of the main areas we can take control of our lives and stop the globalists from hitting us with poison that they allow in the water supply.
[02:05:55.780 --> 02:05:58.780]  In some cases, they add to the water supply like fluoride.
[02:06:02.780 --> 02:06:04.780]  Government cover-ups.
[02:06:04.780 --> 02:06:06.780]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:06:06.780 --> 02:06:08.780]  Well, so does he.
[02:06:08.780 --> 02:06:13.780]  Live from the Infowar.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:32.780 --> 02:06:38.780]  Fire all of your guns at once and explode into space.
[02:06:41.780 --> 02:06:54.780]  So, there have been a lot of reporters on ABC, CBS, NBC, MSNBC, CNN, Washington Post, New York Times, Rolling Stone Magazine,
[02:06:54.780 --> 02:06:58.780]  come out and say that Sound of Freedom is a fraud.
[02:06:58.780 --> 02:07:00.780]  There's no child kidnapping going on.
[02:07:00.780 --> 02:07:02.780]  You got brain worms.
[02:07:02.780 --> 02:07:06.780]  You're terrible if you believe what's going on.
[02:07:06.780 --> 02:07:09.780]  And they attack a movie based on certified true stories, convictions.
[02:07:09.780 --> 02:07:11.780]  All these kids say.
[02:07:11.780 --> 02:07:16.780]  So, I was like, since I just chose one little swarmy clip out of dozens that I've seen,
[02:07:16.780 --> 02:07:19.780]  I said, who is that CNN commentator?
[02:07:19.780 --> 02:07:20.780]  What's that guy's name?
[02:07:20.780 --> 02:07:22.780]  Let's put him up on screen if we can here.
[02:07:23.780 --> 02:07:26.780]  His name is Mike Rothschild.
[02:07:26.780 --> 02:07:28.780]  We ought to invite him on the show.
[02:07:28.780 --> 02:07:30.780]  Hey, Mike.
[02:07:30.780 --> 02:07:32.780]  We'd like to invite him down to Texas.
[02:07:32.780 --> 02:07:33.780]  We can take him to the border.
[02:07:33.780 --> 02:07:35.780]  In fact, I'm officially going to invite Mike Rothschild.
[02:07:35.780 --> 02:07:38.780]  I want Scott to call him or Daria to call him.
[02:07:38.780 --> 02:07:44.780]  I'm going to say, Mike, we'll fly you down here and we'll give you first class treatment
[02:07:44.780 --> 02:07:50.780]  and we'll go to the Texas border and I'll show you little kids without any IDs or any information
[02:07:50.780 --> 02:07:55.780]  being handed over to random charities and strangers with no record of where they're going.
[02:07:55.780 --> 02:07:59.780]  And do you think that that is a good idea?
[02:08:03.780 --> 02:08:09.780]  And, I mean, because I'm just trying to find out because, you know,
[02:08:09.780 --> 02:08:12.780]  I don't think you're probably related to the Rothschilds,
[02:08:12.780 --> 02:08:17.780]  the actual guys heavily invested in the Atlantic slave trade and all the rest of that.
[02:08:17.780 --> 02:08:20.780]  But I'm saying the Atlantic sex trade happened.
[02:08:20.780 --> 02:08:21.780]  Mass shootings are real.
[02:08:21.780 --> 02:08:22.780]  Those happened, too.
[02:08:22.780 --> 02:08:24.780]  We're not supposed to ever question a big event.
[02:08:24.780 --> 02:08:29.780]  But you guys are saying there's no child sex slavery or it's all big, exaggerated,
[02:08:29.780 --> 02:08:32.780]  so people can play the part of heroes, right?
[02:08:34.780 --> 02:08:37.780]  Why don't you guys queue up some of the footage we've got of the charities ladies saying,
[02:08:37.780 --> 02:08:39.780]  this is my baby, just handing them off.
[02:08:39.780 --> 02:08:40.780]  We've got all this.
[02:08:40.780 --> 02:08:41.780]  She's back there.
[02:08:41.780 --> 02:08:42.780]  Oh, it's my baby.
[02:08:42.780 --> 02:08:45.780]  And then they just hand them off to just disappear to God knows where.
[02:08:45.780 --> 02:08:53.780]  But even the New Yorker magazine and the New York Times are kind of schizophrenic on this
[02:08:53.780 --> 02:08:56.780]  because they've got articles about sex slavery and sex trafficking
[02:08:56.780 --> 02:09:05.780]  and human slavery of children in sweat houses, sweat shops, industrial labor,
[02:09:05.780 --> 02:09:09.780]  little girls getting their pigtails caught in the conveyor belt,
[02:09:09.780 --> 02:09:11.780]  having their scalp pulled off.
[02:09:12.780 --> 02:09:15.780]  But then you're saying it doesn't exist.
[02:09:16.780 --> 02:09:19.780]  And I guess you are swarming and everything.
[02:09:19.780 --> 02:09:24.780]  So I guess there's no – I mean, hell, the federal government just took off the Justice Department website.
[02:09:24.780 --> 02:09:29.780]  Child sex trafficking, child sex slavery, child prostitution, it officially doesn't exist anymore
[02:09:29.780 --> 02:09:31.780]  because it's like the dam's broken.
[02:09:31.780 --> 02:09:32.780]  It's everywhere.
[02:09:32.780 --> 02:09:33.780]  It's just exploded.
[02:09:33.780 --> 02:09:34.780]  It doesn't matter.
[02:09:34.780 --> 02:09:41.780]  We have CNN with no viewers with a cockroach like this climbing up out of the bowels of hell
[02:09:43.780 --> 02:09:49.780]  to swarmily tell us that it doesn't compute,
[02:09:49.780 --> 02:09:55.780]  that Mr. Ballard, Tim Ballard, and others just want to be heroes.
[02:09:55.780 --> 02:09:57.780]  But here's your real hero.
[02:09:58.780 --> 02:10:02.780]  And meanwhile, you have the storm run by leftists and globalist intelligence agencies
[02:10:02.780 --> 02:10:07.780]  to take all the real stories of child sex trafficking and world government, the New World Order,
[02:10:07.780 --> 02:10:11.780]  and then make it look ridiculous and sound insane so that they can then say,
[02:10:11.780 --> 02:10:13.780]  see, none of it exists.
[02:10:17.780 --> 02:10:21.780]  And then imagine being the apologist for that
[02:10:21.780 --> 02:10:26.780]  and saying Tim Ballard's work of decades and the convictions and all of it's nothing.
[02:10:26.780 --> 02:10:27.780]  It doesn't exist.
[02:10:27.780 --> 02:10:28.780]  It's a fraud.
[02:10:28.780 --> 02:10:33.780]  I supposedly lost a billion and a half dollars for saying maybe a mass shooting didn't happen
[02:10:33.780 --> 02:10:34.780]  because the Internet was questioning it.
[02:10:34.780 --> 02:10:36.780]  And they said you can never question this.
[02:10:36.780 --> 02:10:38.780]  You can never question a mass shooting.
[02:10:39.780 --> 02:10:41.780]  And the media dredged it up and blew it up and made it a huge deal.
[02:10:41.780 --> 02:10:44.780]  And years after I said I thought it happened, I got sued.
[02:10:44.780 --> 02:10:46.780]  A judge found me guilty, which you're not supposed to do in America.
[02:10:46.780 --> 02:10:47.780]  A jury was told all this stuff.
[02:10:47.780 --> 02:10:49.780]  And they said a billion and a half dollars.
[02:10:49.780 --> 02:10:50.780]  Well, I didn't have two million dollars.
[02:10:50.780 --> 02:10:59.780]  But under that rule, this guy's saying child sex trafficking, he's lessening the pain of these children.
[02:10:59.780 --> 02:11:02.780]  He's pooh-poohing that.
[02:11:02.780 --> 02:11:04.780]  Now, I believe he has a First Amendment.
[02:11:04.780 --> 02:11:07.780]  I don't think Mr. Rothschild thinks I have one.
[02:11:07.780 --> 02:11:11.780]  But, no, he has a right to say there's no human trafficking at the border,
[02:11:11.780 --> 02:11:13.780]  there's no sex slavery, there's no sweatshops.
[02:11:13.780 --> 02:11:15.780]  He has a right to say the moon's made out of cheese.
[02:11:15.780 --> 02:11:17.780]  He has a right to say the moon's made out of cheese.
[02:11:17.780 --> 02:11:21.780]  We have a right to go down there and show you the truth.
[02:11:27.780 --> 02:11:29.780]  Is that Alexander Soros?
[02:11:29.780 --> 02:11:34.780]  Are these, like, clones that come out of the same, like, factory warehouse or something?
[02:11:34.780 --> 02:11:36.780]  The same tank?
[02:11:36.780 --> 02:11:40.780]  I mean, woo-hoo!
[02:11:40.780 --> 02:11:43.780]  Let me just think, the good Lord, I ain't this guy.
[02:11:44.780 --> 02:11:46.780]  Poor thing can't help it.
[02:11:46.780 --> 02:11:50.780]  Let's go ahead and play another clip of him, and we'll go to your calls.
[02:11:53.780 --> 02:11:59.780]  And you seem pretty familiar with him, because he doesn't really hide his association
[02:11:59.780 --> 02:12:05.780]  with this real wild plot that involves, you know, drinking the...
[02:12:07.780 --> 02:12:09.780]  No, he doesn't hide it at all.
[02:12:09.780 --> 02:12:12.780]  And you have a lot of people who are in this world of QAnon
[02:12:12.780 --> 02:12:14.780]  who say, oh, they don't know what that is, they've never heard of it,
[02:12:14.780 --> 02:12:16.780]  they're just asking questions.
[02:12:16.780 --> 02:12:19.780]  With somebody like Jim Caviezel, he is openly embracing it,
[02:12:19.780 --> 02:12:22.780]  he's openly using its catchphrases and its concepts,
[02:12:22.780 --> 02:12:24.780]  he's speaking at QAnon conventions,
[02:12:24.780 --> 02:12:28.780]  and this film is being marketed to either specific QAnon believers
[02:12:28.780 --> 02:12:32.780]  or to people who believe all of the same tenets as QAnon,
[02:12:32.780 --> 02:12:34.780]  but claim they don't know what it is.
[02:12:34.780 --> 02:12:39.780]  And The Sound of Freedom does focus on a real issue of sex trafficking,
[02:12:39.780 --> 02:12:43.780]  but that theme, it's sort of like that kernel of truth
[02:12:43.780 --> 02:12:46.780]  that feeds the QAnon conspiracy theory.
[02:12:46.780 --> 02:12:50.780]  Tell us how those two things work together.
[02:12:51.780 --> 02:12:55.780]  Sure, and the most durable and the most believable conspiracy theories
[02:12:55.780 --> 02:12:59.780]  are not entirely false, there's something in them that is true
[02:12:59.780 --> 02:13:02.780]  and the rest of it is false, but the believers point to the one true thing
[02:13:02.780 --> 02:13:05.780]  and they say, oh, you don't believe that this particular thing is true.
[02:13:05.780 --> 02:13:08.780]  In terms of child trafficking, we know trafficking is real,
[02:13:08.780 --> 02:13:10.780]  it has real victims, no one is denying that,
[02:13:10.780 --> 02:13:13.780]  but these films are created out of moral panics,
[02:13:13.780 --> 02:13:17.780]  they're created out of bogus statistics, they're created out of fear,
[02:13:17.780 --> 02:13:19.780]  and with something like Sound of Freedom,
[02:13:19.780 --> 02:13:24.780]  it specifically is looking at QAnon concepts of these child trafficking rings
[02:13:24.780 --> 02:13:26.780]  that are run by the high-level elites,
[02:13:26.780 --> 02:13:29.780]  and only people like Tim Ballard, and only people like Jim Caviezel,
[02:13:29.780 --> 02:13:32.780]  and by extension, only people like the ticket buyer
[02:13:32.780 --> 02:13:35.780]  can help bring these trafficking rings down.
[02:13:36.780 --> 02:13:38.780]  So, we're not denying it's happening,
[02:13:38.780 --> 02:13:42.780]  we're just denying Jeffrey Epstein, Mossad, CIA, and MI6
[02:13:42.780 --> 02:13:45.780]  ran tens of thousands of little girls and boys.
[02:13:45.780 --> 02:13:49.780]  We're not denying it's happening, we're just not going to get into NIGARD
[02:13:49.780 --> 02:13:52.780]  and them even having women give birth to babies
[02:13:52.780 --> 02:13:55.780]  so they can be exsanguinated for body parts for rich men.
[02:13:55.780 --> 02:13:57.780]  We're not saying it's happening,
[02:13:57.780 --> 02:14:00.780]  we don't want to hear about the UN and giant child cademic rings,
[02:14:00.780 --> 02:14:03.780]  or the deputy head of the Clinton Foundation being convicted for smuggling children.
[02:14:04.780 --> 02:14:07.780]  We don't want to, you know, oh, no, no, children are being abused,
[02:14:07.780 --> 02:14:09.780]  just not all the big official cases.
[02:14:09.780 --> 02:14:12.780]  Oh, and no one's getting organs from children,
[02:14:12.780 --> 02:14:14.780]  even though it's on record they are.
[02:14:14.780 --> 02:14:16.780]  No one's getting their blood.
[02:14:18.780 --> 02:14:23.780]  Well, I can pull up where they have headlines from federal court in documents,
[02:14:23.780 --> 02:14:26.780]  babies, fetuses delivered with still beating hearts
[02:14:26.780 --> 02:14:29.780]  to U.S. research facilities and universities.
[02:14:29.780 --> 02:14:34.780]  Or baby parts used in flavoring by major food corporations.
[02:14:34.780 --> 02:14:37.780]  Or imagine an even crazier thing.
[02:14:37.780 --> 02:14:39.780]  Honey, drink blood, oh, that's not happening.
[02:14:39.780 --> 02:14:42.780]  Imagine, of course it is, imagine,
[02:14:42.780 --> 02:14:46.780]  oh, Adrenochrome, that's so Avatar, his new movie.
[02:14:46.780 --> 02:14:48.780]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:14:48.780 --> 02:14:52.780]  Imagine the state secretly talks to your autistic seven-year-old,
[02:14:52.780 --> 02:14:55.780]  who's a boy, and gives him lollipops and candy
[02:14:55.780 --> 02:14:58.780]  and sends him to a meeting with other kids that say they're really in other sex
[02:14:58.780 --> 02:15:01.780]  and then you're secretly put in a database that's kept secret from your parents
[02:15:01.780 --> 02:15:06.780]  and then the parents are approached when they're seven or eight
[02:15:06.780 --> 02:15:10.780]  and told your child wants to transition to another sex
[02:15:10.780 --> 02:15:15.780]  and if you complain, multiple states have passed laws to take your child from you.
[02:15:15.780 --> 02:15:18.780]  Or even if your child ran away, they would take them.
[02:15:18.780 --> 02:15:21.780]  The government would then put them in a secret facility
[02:15:21.780 --> 02:15:23.780]  and never tell you where they went
[02:15:23.780 --> 02:15:25.780]  and you would just think your kid had disappeared.
[02:15:25.780 --> 02:15:28.780]  That's law in Washington State.
[02:15:28.780 --> 02:15:30.780]  That's law in other states.
[02:15:30.780 --> 02:15:34.780]  Imagine cutting little boys' genitals off
[02:15:34.780 --> 02:15:37.780]  and then for years putting a giant prosthesis in there
[02:15:37.780 --> 02:15:42.780]  to make the open wound stay open, hoping it healed, and in most cases it doesn't.
[02:15:42.780 --> 02:15:47.780]  Imagine ripping the forearm muscles off of little girls and their thigh legs
[02:15:47.780 --> 02:15:52.780]  and then building giant, lifeless, painful, no-pleasure center
[02:15:53.780 --> 02:15:57.780]  penises that on average fall off within six months
[02:15:57.780 --> 02:16:03.780]  and have a piece of PVC pipe stuck in them, a plastic tube as the urethra.
[02:16:05.780 --> 02:16:07.780]  And then you wonder why they commit suicide.
[02:16:07.780 --> 02:16:12.780]  Imagine a world where little girls have their forearms cut off
[02:16:12.780 --> 02:16:15.780]  so the muscle can make a fake penis.
[02:16:16.780 --> 02:16:19.780]  That's even more preposterous.
[02:16:19.780 --> 02:16:23.780]  But see, Q doesn't talk about that because Q is run by the globalists.
[02:16:23.780 --> 02:16:26.780]  Not the poor Q followers, but the disinfo.
[02:16:26.780 --> 02:16:28.780]  Oh, underground bases, millions of kids.
[02:16:28.780 --> 02:16:31.780]  Oh, there's earthquakes because the special forces are saving them.
[02:16:31.780 --> 02:16:35.779]  No, the special forces are at the Texas border
[02:16:35.779 --> 02:16:40.779]  under the orders of the president to help ship the children in.
[02:16:41.779 --> 02:16:47.779]  The State Guard, the National Guard, they complete the smuggling process.
[02:16:47.779 --> 02:16:48.779]  The government's overrun.
[02:16:48.779 --> 02:16:53.779]  The indictments are for Donald Trump and the patriots, not imaginary indictments.
[02:16:56.779 --> 02:16:59.779]  I'm going to go to your break. I'm going to go to your calls.
[02:17:00.779 --> 02:17:03.779]  It's just mind-blowing to sit here and watch this.
[02:17:03.779 --> 02:17:05.779]  They're mutilating children out in the open.
[02:17:05.779 --> 02:17:10.779]  They're not even doing DNA testing of children now that they just turn loose with no ID
[02:17:10.779 --> 02:17:14.779]  so that when they get found dead later, it's a nameless person.
[02:17:14.779 --> 02:17:16.779]  They're covering their tracks. It's out in the open.
[02:17:16.779 --> 02:17:22.779]  And then some smarmy, crazy, bug-eyed weasel head
[02:17:22.779 --> 02:17:26.779]  that if I was going to make a new Dracula movie,
[02:17:28.779 --> 02:17:31.779]  I would probably cast Nick Cage.
[02:17:31.779 --> 02:17:34.779]  I saw him in that new comedy Dracula movie. It was pretty good.
[02:17:34.779 --> 02:17:36.779]  I would cast like Nick Cage as Dracula.
[02:17:38.779 --> 02:17:42.779]  And then the guys that work for Dracula that go out and grab the kids for him
[02:17:43.779 --> 02:17:47.779]  would be Rothschild and Brian Stalter.
[02:17:47.779 --> 02:17:50.779]  I think you would have a couple Renfields in this new movie.
[02:17:50.779 --> 02:17:53.779]  Because, man, you see them walk in, no makeup needed, no nothing.
[02:17:53.779 --> 02:17:55.779]  I mean, we're talking knuckle-draggers.
[02:17:55.779 --> 02:17:58.779]  And I'm not saying they go out and grab kids. Of course not.
[02:17:58.779 --> 02:18:03.779]  They just go on TV and the Davos Group and call for censorship and control
[02:18:03.779 --> 02:18:06.779]  and say nobody's hurting kids.
[02:18:07.779 --> 02:18:11.779]  Yeah, there might be a little trafficking here and there, but nobody's killing them.
[02:18:11.779 --> 02:18:16.779]  There's no governments involved. I mean, that is just ridiculous.
[02:18:17.779 --> 02:18:23.779]  There are no governments involved like MI6, CIA, Mossad.
[02:18:24.779 --> 02:18:29.779]  None of them. Zero. It's not happening.
[02:18:30.779 --> 02:18:35.779]  But there are record white supremacists everywhere killing everyone.
[02:18:35.779 --> 02:18:38.779]  You just saw in Dallas those Hispanic KKK guys.
[02:18:38.779 --> 02:18:41.779]  They weren't in the KKK, but whatever.
[02:18:41.779 --> 02:18:46.779]  It's any crime. It's white people's fault.
[02:18:47.779 --> 02:18:50.779]  I mean, you just heard earlier Asians are now white supremacists.
[02:18:51.779 --> 02:18:54.779]  I'm going to go to your phone calls. I really appreciate you all holding.
[02:18:54.779 --> 02:18:57.779]  I mentioned this and I'll just take calls until this ends.
[02:18:57.779 --> 02:18:59.779]  I'll get to everybody. I really appreciate you.
[02:18:59.779 --> 02:19:02.779]  Here's a local newscast, which again doesn't exist.
[02:19:02.779 --> 02:19:05.779]  A Franklin, Tennessee man finds a cell phone at a pizza shop.
[02:19:05.779 --> 02:19:07.779]  Pizza, pizza, pizza.
[02:19:07.779 --> 02:19:11.779]  And it leads to the arrest of the soccer coach who drugged and raped children.
[02:19:12.779 --> 02:19:16.779]  That just can't be. I mean, that just can't be. Here it is.
[02:19:17.779 --> 02:19:22.779]  The shop worker is to thank for this shocking discovery that was made on Compost's phone.
[02:19:22.779 --> 02:19:26.779]  News 2's Megan Kernan spoke with the man who says he was mortified.
[02:19:27.779 --> 02:19:31.779]  It was just a real busy night. You know, we were getting ready to close down.
[02:19:31.779 --> 02:19:39.779]  We had a real late rush out of nowhere and near the end, one of our customers came up and handed me a phone.
[02:19:39.779 --> 02:19:45.779]  Trying to figure out who it belonged to, Joshua LaRue started searching through the unlocked phone.
[02:19:45.779 --> 02:19:51.779]  Then there was a video on there and the video just definitely led me to believe that this was a problem.
[02:19:51.779 --> 02:19:57.779]  What LaRue found instead was dozens of photos and videos of unconscious children.
[02:19:57.779 --> 02:20:05.779]  I called the non-emergency number and they said, I told them I think I had found a phone with child pornography on it.
[02:20:05.779 --> 02:20:13.779]  I mean, imagine trying to find somebody whose phone it is and you find something like that. Something terrible. I mean, awful.
[02:20:13.779 --> 02:20:18.779]  LaRue's manager says Campos went to Marcos the day after looking for his phone.
[02:20:18.779 --> 02:20:23.779]  She quickly took a picture of his car outside the restaurant before he drove away,
[02:20:23.779 --> 02:20:27.779]  ultimately leading Franklin police right to him and to arrest him.
[02:20:27.779 --> 02:20:34.779]  He acted very nervous. He really did. I mean, his hands were shaking. He was very panicky.
[02:20:34.779 --> 02:20:37.779]  He was like, I left my phone right here. That's the only thing I could understand him saying.
[02:20:37.779 --> 02:20:42.779]  LaRue tells us he was disgusted at what he discovered and still is.
[02:20:42.779 --> 02:20:49.779]  He's just really having a hard time. He's having a hard time with it. It's very disturbing. No one ever wants to see anything like that.
[02:20:49.779 --> 02:20:56.779]  But LaRue says knowing Campos is behind bars now, he'd do it all over again in a heartbeat.
[02:20:56.779 --> 02:21:00.779]  And he's holding out hope that the remaining victims will be identified soon.
[02:21:00.779 --> 02:21:11.779]  That's all I can hope is that they get the help that they need and that they can have a happy life is all I want from this.
[02:21:12.779 --> 02:21:20.779]  And Marcos Pizza has even offered to pay for LaRue to be seen by a therapist since he's still at night.
[02:21:20.779 --> 02:21:26.779]  All of LaRue's co-workers are calling him a hero for his quick response after the shocking discovery.
[02:21:26.779 --> 02:21:30.779]  Haley. OK, well, that's great. Why is it a national news story?
[02:21:30.779 --> 02:21:37.779]  And why aren't we hearing about the victims? This is what always happens. You see it and it disappears.
[02:21:38.779 --> 02:21:51.779]  But meanwhile, I just want to say what's up with the glamour shots of Brian Stelter and Mike Rothschild and other people?
[02:21:51.779 --> 02:21:57.779]  Like, do they not know how psychotic they look like that? Like that Alexander Soros deal?
[02:21:57.779 --> 02:22:02.779]  Or we know Biden doesn't know how crazy he looks because he's like, you know, brain dead.
[02:22:02.779 --> 02:22:07.779]  But just imagine you release this as your glamour shot is your.
[02:22:07.779 --> 02:22:15.779]  Just thank your lucky stars every day that you're not Brian Stelter.
[02:22:15.779 --> 02:22:20.779]  Wow. All I can say is, wow. Whoa.
[02:22:20.779 --> 02:22:28.779]  There is the admiral, the first female admiral of the new admiralty at Health and Human Services
[02:22:28.779 --> 02:22:33.779]  who wants to help your children lose their genitals. Rachel Levine.
[02:22:33.779 --> 02:22:40.779]  Then. Wow. Interesting. Yes.
[02:22:40.779 --> 02:22:44.779]  No one's after our children. Everything's fine. Everything's fine.
[02:22:44.779 --> 02:22:48.779]  Look at this nice lady. Please get him off the screen.
[02:22:48.779 --> 02:22:53.779]  OK, let's go ahead now and go to Carlos in Canada, then Nick in Tennessee and others.
[02:22:53.779 --> 02:22:57.779]  Carlos, thanks for holding her on the air. Thank you, Alex.
[02:22:57.779 --> 02:23:05.779]  I wanted to draw attention to something that is slipping under the curtains and nobody's really doing anything about it.
[02:23:05.779 --> 02:23:16.779]  And it concerns the FBI. It concerns Huma Abedin, a World Forum young global leader, believe it or not,
[02:23:16.779 --> 02:23:21.779]  and her husband's laptop, Anthony Weiner's laptop.
[02:23:22.779 --> 02:23:29.779]  Two days after Jeffrey Epstein sort of left us, the FBI was all over Little St. James Island.
[02:23:29.779 --> 02:23:34.779]  I thought, my God, they're going to come back with some real evidence.
[02:23:34.779 --> 02:23:39.779]  As a matter of fact, I think they were just doing a nice cleaning and bleaching everything,
[02:23:39.779 --> 02:23:49.779]  because for all we know, the laptop contained information which was very revealing of what was going on in Little St. James Island.
[02:23:49.779 --> 02:23:57.779]  And there you have visitors to the island, which are in the tapes apparently in a laptop.
[02:23:57.779 --> 02:23:59.779]  Twelve people.
[02:23:59.779 --> 02:24:01.779]  Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Hold on a second.
[02:24:01.779 --> 02:24:06.779]  CNN's Mike Rothschild told me there are no elites, no islands, no government involvement.
[02:24:06.779 --> 02:24:11.779]  So I'm going to have to... Carlos, you know if CNN says something, it's true.
[02:24:11.779 --> 02:24:16.779]  Are you saying there's government and elite involvement in sex trafficking to blackmail people?
[02:24:16.779 --> 02:24:19.779]  Because Mike Rothschild said that that's not real.
[02:24:19.779 --> 02:24:22.779]  Well, he's a pedophilia denier.
[02:24:22.779 --> 02:24:28.779]  No, no, no. He's on CNN, sir. That's like, he's impossible for him to be wrong.
[02:24:28.779 --> 02:24:30.779]  Well, worms in the head, I don't know.
[02:24:30.779 --> 02:24:36.779]  But I certainly know that he is denying that, let's say, there's no pedophilia in Brooklyn.
[02:24:36.779 --> 02:24:39.779]  Would you care to Google that? He should know.
[02:24:39.779 --> 02:24:45.779]  And if you want to talk about Rothschild, Lynn Forrester, the Rothschild, is in the flight logs.
[02:24:45.779 --> 02:24:50.779]  In the Louis and James trips on the Lolita Express with Jeffrey Epstein.
[02:24:50.779 --> 02:24:52.779]  So, I mean, let's get real.
[02:24:52.779 --> 02:24:58.779]  Oh, now you're saying Rothschild's posed with black magic queens in front of paintings of Lucifer.
[02:24:58.779 --> 02:25:00.779]  Sir, I appreciate your call.
[02:25:00.779 --> 02:25:04.779]  Anthony Weiner is a wonderful person, and so is Jeffrey Epstein.
[02:25:04.779 --> 02:25:06.779]  Of course, I'm being sarcastic.
[02:25:06.779 --> 02:25:08.779]  I mean, this is just desperateness, folks.
[02:25:09.779 --> 02:25:10.779]  And imagine being CNN.
[02:25:10.779 --> 02:25:15.779]  They go, let's have this little chicken-neck guy on here to attack Sound of Freedom,
[02:25:15.779 --> 02:25:18.779]  and that'll make everybody shut up.
[02:25:21.779 --> 02:25:24.779]  Wow. Nick in Tennessee, thanks for holding her on the air worldwide.
[02:25:39.779 --> 02:25:45.779]  In fact, we'll probably play that short intro for you about Hunter Biden and the cocaine.
[02:25:45.779 --> 02:25:47.779]  Hey, we're moving quick, Nick. What's on your mind?
[02:25:47.779 --> 02:25:51.779]  I love you, Alex. I love you, Alex. I'm sorry for my bad thing in there.
[02:25:51.779 --> 02:25:54.779]  Hey, you're a heavy metal rock star of journalism.
[02:25:54.779 --> 02:25:56.779]  I just wanted to tell you that.
[02:25:56.779 --> 02:26:02.779]  I want to talk about the absurdity of the propagandist media,
[02:26:02.779 --> 02:26:06.779]  which has gone off the deep end with child trafficking.
[02:26:06.779 --> 02:26:09.779]  And also, I want to talk about QAnon.
[02:26:09.779 --> 02:26:18.779]  QAnon was hijacked years ago by deep state operatives and by various people in the media.
[02:26:18.779 --> 02:26:24.779]  And every time they use QAnon as a wooden dummy to beat up on,
[02:26:24.779 --> 02:26:29.779]  every time you hear something that they want to throw under the bus,
[02:26:29.779 --> 02:26:32.779]  they want to cover it up, they always talk about QAnon.
[02:26:33.779 --> 02:26:38.779]  Yeah, QAnon takes real things and then adds a bunch of BS to them to be discrediting.
[02:26:38.779 --> 02:26:40.779]  That's what they do, yeah.
[02:26:40.779 --> 02:26:46.779]  Yeah, that's why I started the neo-anonymous, the new anonymous on Substack.
[02:26:46.779 --> 02:26:50.779]  It's nickanonymous.substack.com.
[02:26:50.779 --> 02:26:53.779]  And I just wrote an article about Sound of Freedom, actually,
[02:26:53.779 --> 02:26:56.779]  and I talk about Hunter S. Thompson.
[02:26:57.779 --> 02:27:03.779]  Hunter S. Thompson and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas talk about Adrenochrome, okay?
[02:27:03.779 --> 02:27:05.779]  And it's a famous line, it says,
[02:27:05.779 --> 02:27:10.779]  as your lawyer, I advise you to take this Adrenochrome, okay?
[02:27:10.779 --> 02:27:13.779]  And meanwhile, they want to deny it exists.
[02:27:13.779 --> 02:27:18.779]  It's some QAnon conspiracy that Adrenochrome isn't a thing
[02:27:18.779 --> 02:27:20.779]  and that it doesn't exist when it's right in our face.
[02:27:20.779 --> 02:27:21.779]  It's always right in our face.
[02:27:21.779 --> 02:27:25.779]  Well, his lawyer paid him in Adrenochrome, who was a Satanist,
[02:27:25.779 --> 02:27:29.779]  and he later admitted that he did pay him in Adrenochrome.
[02:27:29.779 --> 02:27:31.779]  And look, I think it's more of a metaphor,
[02:27:31.779 --> 02:27:37.779]  and some of the Satanists and Black Sabbathists do drink blood and torture children and all the rest of this,
[02:27:37.779 --> 02:27:43.779]  but it's more a metaphor of sucking the soul and the innocence out of children
[02:27:43.779 --> 02:27:45.779]  as a metaphor for the spiritualness of it.
[02:27:45.779 --> 02:27:48.779]  Like, I don't believe there's an actual Dracula, but it's a spirit like that.
[02:27:48.779 --> 02:27:50.779]  Does that make sense?
[02:27:50.779 --> 02:27:54.779]  Well, it's that, and there's actual science to it, too.
[02:27:54.779 --> 02:27:58.779]  The adrenal gland, when people are terrified and they're scared,
[02:27:58.779 --> 02:28:03.779]  your adrenal gland pumps out Adrenochrome.
[02:28:03.779 --> 02:28:08.779]  David Icke first put this out 33 years ago, put it on my show 29 years ago.
[02:28:08.779 --> 02:28:09.779]  No, I know, and I believe, David.
[02:28:09.779 --> 02:28:13.779]  I believe that they do drink the blood of terrified children.
[02:28:13.779 --> 02:28:14.779]  Jimmy Savelle did that.
[02:28:14.779 --> 02:28:17.779]  I mean, it's in BBC News that he worked there, by the way,
[02:28:17.779 --> 02:28:19.779]  that he would torture children and drink their blood.
[02:28:19.779 --> 02:28:21.779]  I mean, this is Prince Charles' best friend.
[02:28:21.779 --> 02:28:23.779]  Yeah, Jimmy Savelle's a monster.
[02:28:23.779 --> 02:28:29.779]  He was in the media, and he was everybody's best friend in the U.K.,
[02:28:29.779 --> 02:28:33.779]  and he was showcased as a hero, a journalist.
[02:28:33.779 --> 02:28:35.779]  He was a journalist for how many years?
[02:28:35.779 --> 02:28:40.779]  And now we find out he's a pedophile years ago by now.
[02:28:40.779 --> 02:28:41.779]  He was beyond a pedophile.
[02:28:41.779 --> 02:28:47.779]  He would be there when children were dying at the hospital,
[02:28:47.779 --> 02:28:49.779]  and they reportedly have sex with them after they were dead,
[02:28:49.779 --> 02:28:51.779]  but he would do it while they were alive.
[02:28:51.779 --> 02:28:55.779]  Thank you so much for the call, but according to CNN, none of this exists.
[02:28:57.779 --> 02:29:00.779]  The globalists aren't just targeting us through the poison shots
[02:29:00.779 --> 02:29:03.779]  or the electromagnetic 5G or the GMO crops.
[02:29:03.779 --> 02:29:05.779]  They're hitting us with hundreds of chemicals
[02:29:05.779 --> 02:29:09.779]  that the EPA has authorized companies and industry to use.
[02:29:09.779 --> 02:29:13.779]  One of the top pesticides used is atrazine.
[02:29:13.779 --> 02:29:17.779]  The allowable level the government admits that they allow to be in your water supply
[02:29:17.779 --> 02:29:22.779]  is enough to sterilize you and basically turn your son into a feminized mutant.
[02:29:22.779 --> 02:29:23.779]  Look it up.
[02:29:23.779 --> 02:29:25.779]  Don't let them do this to your family.
[02:29:25.779 --> 02:29:28.779]  We have the very best gravity-fed filter system out there,
[02:29:28.779 --> 02:29:31.779]  highest rated at half the price of leading competitors,
[02:29:31.779 --> 02:29:33.779]  the Alexa Pure, ready to ship to you right now.
[02:29:33.779 --> 02:29:36.779]  We have replacement filters for folks who've already gotten it.
[02:29:36.779 --> 02:29:38.779]  It does 10,000 gallons before you replace them.
[02:29:38.779 --> 02:29:40.779]  It is amazing. It's great for your home, your business.
[02:29:40.779 --> 02:29:43.779]  You can put swamp water in it, tap water, well water.
[02:29:43.779 --> 02:29:45.779]  Almost everything's contaminated.
[02:29:45.779 --> 02:29:49.779]  This is how you take control of the fluids in your body and counter the globalist onslaught.
[02:29:49.779 --> 02:29:51.779]  Get yours today at Infowarsstore.com for a limited time.
[02:29:51.779 --> 02:29:53.779]  We're running a 10% discount.
[02:29:53.779 --> 02:29:54.779]  That is a huge discount.
[02:29:54.779 --> 02:29:55.779]  It's probably the lowest price out there.
[02:29:55.779 --> 02:29:56.779]  You need this filter.
[02:29:57.779 --> 02:30:00.779]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World,
[02:30:00.779 --> 02:30:03.779]  is a historic book that documents the globalists in their own words,
[02:30:03.779 --> 02:30:05.779]  planned for our future.
[02:30:05.779 --> 02:30:06.779]  That is a hellish future.
[02:30:06.779 --> 02:30:10.779]  Now you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them,
[02:30:10.779 --> 02:30:13.779]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World
[02:30:13.779 --> 02:30:16.779]  at bookstores, Amazon, or Infowarsstore.com.
[02:30:16.779 --> 02:30:19.779]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book
[02:30:19.779 --> 02:30:21.779]  after the signed copies we got run out.
[02:30:21.779 --> 02:30:24.779]  And there's about 1,000 left of them right now.
[02:30:24.779 --> 02:30:27.779]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World,
[02:30:27.779 --> 02:30:29.779]  a signed copy at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:30:29.779 --> 02:30:33.779]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[02:30:33.779 --> 02:30:36.779]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book.
[02:30:36.779 --> 02:30:39.779]  You'll also know that you help keep Infowars on the air.
[02:30:40.779 --> 02:30:42.779]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book
[02:30:42.779 --> 02:30:46.779]  or unsigned copies, but I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet
[02:30:46.779 --> 02:30:49.779]  to go to Infowarsstore.com and get a signed copy
[02:30:49.779 --> 02:30:52.779]  and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate them to the library
[02:30:52.779 --> 02:30:54.779]  or give them to the local school.
[02:30:54.779 --> 02:30:57.779]  This is an Infowar, I'm counting on you, and thank you for your support.
[02:30:57.779 --> 02:30:59.779]  Infowars is a one-of-a-kind operation,
[02:30:59.779 --> 02:31:03.779]  and so please go to Infowarsstore.com and just make a donation.
[02:31:03.779 --> 02:31:05.779]  And you can make it one time or recurring.
[02:31:05.779 --> 02:31:08.779]  You have a little profile there, cancel anytime.
[02:31:08.779 --> 02:31:13.779]  Every 15 days, every month, every 3 months, every 6 months, up to 9 months,
[02:31:13.779 --> 02:31:16.779]  you can go in and every month or every week,
[02:31:16.779 --> 02:31:18.779]  whenever you want, you program it, you just click it,
[02:31:18.779 --> 02:31:20.779]  and then you decide when you want to make a donation.
[02:31:20.779 --> 02:31:24.779]  So please do that as well, that way we get 95% of it after credit card fees
[02:31:24.779 --> 02:31:26.779]  instead of making 20, 30, 40% like we do on the products.
[02:31:26.779 --> 02:31:28.779]  But these really are amazing products.
[02:31:28.779 --> 02:31:30.779]  The Big July 4 sale is going on right now.
[02:31:30.779 --> 02:31:33.779]  This is such a critical platform in the fight against the New World Order.
[02:31:33.779 --> 02:31:35.779]  The enemies out in the open were vindicated.
[02:31:35.779 --> 02:31:36.779]  People are listening more than ever.
[02:31:36.779 --> 02:31:39.779]  But in this major recession, going into depression,
[02:31:39.779 --> 02:31:41.779]  and with supply chain breakdowns, I know it's hard.
[02:31:41.779 --> 02:31:42.779]  I know times are tough.
[02:31:42.779 --> 02:31:45.779]  So thank you for your support, but whatever you do, pray for the broadcast
[02:31:45.779 --> 02:31:47.779]  and share the articles and the videos.
[02:31:47.779 --> 02:31:51.779]  That you can do for free, and that's just as important as keeping us on air.
[02:31:51.779 --> 02:31:53.779]  So however God leads you in your heart to support us,
[02:31:53.779 --> 02:31:56.779]  please support us now, and I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
[02:31:56.779 --> 02:31:57.779]  God bless you.
[02:31:57.779 --> 02:31:59.779]  This is Adam King, host of The Adam King Show,
[02:31:59.779 --> 02:32:01.779]  joined by the one and only Greg Reese of The Reese Report.
[02:32:01.779 --> 02:32:05.779]  We wanted to hop on and send everybody to Infowarsstore.com.
[02:32:05.779 --> 02:32:08.779]  Click this QR code right above Greg Reese.
[02:32:08.779 --> 02:32:14.779]  Buy yourself a Faraday cage, super male vitality, or what Greg has.
[02:32:14.779 --> 02:32:15.779]  Greg, what do you got there?
[02:32:15.779 --> 02:32:17.779]  If you really want to treat yourself to something nice,
[02:32:17.779 --> 02:32:22.779]  get yourself an Alexa Pure water filter and get clean, healthy water
[02:32:22.779 --> 02:32:24.779]  whenever you want it, wherever you want it.
[02:32:24.779 --> 02:32:26.779]  Even if the water pressure goes out,
[02:32:26.779 --> 02:32:30.779]  the gravity-fed water filter has got you covered.
[02:32:30.779 --> 02:32:31.779]  Absolutely.
[02:32:31.779 --> 02:32:36.779]  And we couldn't do any of this without listener support.
[02:32:36.779 --> 02:32:39.779]  I was telling Greg earlier, we're like the real NPR,
[02:32:39.779 --> 02:32:41.779]  the real NPR of the base, right?
[02:32:41.779 --> 02:32:44.779]  So click that QR code right there on your screen right now.
[02:32:44.779 --> 02:32:45.779]  Take out your phone.

[02:32:55.779 --> 02:32:56.779]  Do it now.
[02:32:56.779 --> 02:32:58.779]  Support the Infowar.
[02:32:58.779 --> 02:33:02.779]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[02:33:02.779 --> 02:33:04.779]  it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:06.710 --> 02:33:25.269]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[02:33:25.269 --> 02:33:26.269]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:26.269 --> 02:33:27.269]  All right.
[02:33:27.269 --> 02:33:28.269]  Let me say something and then go right back to your phone calls.
[02:33:28.269 --> 02:33:29.269]  I was walking down the hall during the break and it just hit me.
[02:33:29.269 --> 02:33:41.589]  The whole world is InfoWars now.
[02:33:41.589 --> 02:33:45.630]  Go back to this broadcast 29 years ago and you'd tune into it, you'd say, this is crazy.
[02:33:45.630 --> 02:33:50.949]  But I was just going off with the globalists were planning and what they already done.
[02:33:50.949 --> 02:33:53.189]  And so many other experts were tracking what they were doing.
[02:33:53.189 --> 02:33:55.789]  It's not about the credit.
[02:33:55.789 --> 02:34:03.750]  It's about that, wow, open world government, open cashless society, open sexualization
[02:34:03.750 --> 02:34:10.029]  of children everywhere, pedophile, drag queen time, Democrats passing laws in places like
[02:34:10.029 --> 02:34:16.990]  California where they can have sex with 12-year-old kids, they can give people HIV, massive defunding
[02:34:16.990 --> 02:34:21.669]  of police, just insanity.
[02:34:21.669 --> 02:34:28.189]  The sexual dismemberment of children, the mutilation is just insane.
[02:34:28.189 --> 02:34:30.429]  And they're only getting started.
[02:34:30.429 --> 02:34:33.949]  While they simultaneously deny what they're doing, there's no world government, there's
[02:34:33.949 --> 02:34:36.390]  no planning around the border.
[02:34:36.390 --> 02:34:40.669]  While the border is the most controlled it's ever been.
[02:34:40.669 --> 02:34:44.750]  And it gets crazier and crazier.
[02:34:44.750 --> 02:34:47.949]  The biggest thing I got to remember is that I'm my biggest problem.
[02:34:47.949 --> 02:34:51.429]  Of course, aren't we all our own biggest problems?
[02:34:51.470 --> 02:34:59.429]  When I plug every hour with the great products we have, we have the funds we need to operate.
[02:34:59.429 --> 02:35:01.589]  But when I don't, we don't.
[02:35:01.589 --> 02:35:06.429]  So we've kind of dug out of our hole again, you notice suddenly I'm not plugging a bunch
[02:35:06.429 --> 02:35:09.470]  because well, they told me, okay, there's enough money now or not, we can pay the bills.
[02:35:09.470 --> 02:35:14.150]  I need to get a reserve, I need to hire more reporters, we need to expand plus we got great
[02:35:14.150 --> 02:35:16.589]  products you need.
[02:35:16.589 --> 02:35:20.630]  And if you will just get excited about those products and find out how amazing they are,

[02:36:18.750 --> 02:36:19.949]  The ball is in your court.
[02:36:19.949 --> 02:36:20.949]  Thank you.
[02:36:20.949 --> 02:36:24.150]  And the crew thanks you as well because they're dedicated and want this fight to continue.
[02:36:24.150 --> 02:36:25.150]  All right.
[02:36:25.150 --> 02:36:26.150]  Let's go on the order.
[02:36:26.150 --> 02:36:27.150]  These calls are received.
[02:36:27.150 --> 02:36:28.150]  I'm trying to move quick.
[02:36:28.150 --> 02:36:29.710]  Just make your point with the next person.
[02:36:29.710 --> 02:36:32.509]  Let's go to Joshua in Texas.
[02:36:32.509 --> 02:36:33.509]  Thanks for holding.
[02:36:33.509 --> 02:36:34.509]  Go ahead.
[02:36:34.509 --> 02:36:35.509]  Hey, Alex.
[02:36:35.509 --> 02:36:37.150]  Thank you for taking my call.
[02:36:37.150 --> 02:36:38.910]  My name is Joshua Abraham.
[02:36:38.910 --> 02:36:44.509]  I am the son of Larry Abraham, who wrote the international bestselling book, None Dare
[02:36:44.509 --> 02:36:49.669]  Call a Conspiracy, and you're well aware of my father's work, and I was a guest on your
[02:36:49.669 --> 02:36:52.669]  show back in 2012.
[02:36:52.669 --> 02:36:57.630]  Now I recently moved you to Texas from my house in Beverly Hills, and for eight years
[02:36:57.630 --> 02:37:03.710]  over there, I infiltrated Freemasonry up to the 33rd degree and saw the four holy books
[02:37:03.710 --> 02:37:08.869]  of the Scottish Rite of the 33rd degree and was told the Masonic secret.
[02:37:08.869 --> 02:37:13.910]  Since I've been here in Texas, all I've heard is that this is a from your channels that
[02:37:13.910 --> 02:37:15.349]  this is a globalist problem.
[02:37:15.349 --> 02:37:16.789]  This is globalism.
[02:37:16.789 --> 02:37:22.949]  I can fully I'm only two hours away from you, Jones, and I would like to come on your show
[02:37:22.949 --> 02:37:27.189]  and take you on and debate you how this is not a globalist problem.
[02:37:27.189 --> 02:37:30.310]  All this child trafficking, the borders open.
[02:37:30.310 --> 02:37:35.429]  This is a pure satanic Zionist agenda.
[02:37:35.429 --> 02:37:40.710]  And from the book readings and the book studies that I learned in the Freemasonic lodges there
[02:37:40.710 --> 02:37:47.509]  over in L.A. County, in the highest degrees of Masonry, I was told their Masonic plan,
[02:37:47.509 --> 02:37:54.390]  how this is all going to go down, and why this is happening to us, and why the Zionist
[02:37:54.390 --> 02:37:56.949]  Israeli Mossad is doing this to us.
[02:37:56.949 --> 02:38:02.150]  So if you would allow me to come on your program, I would love to debate you how this is not
[02:38:02.150 --> 02:38:03.150]  globalism.
[02:38:03.710 --> 02:38:06.349]  This is Zionism, full and through.
[02:38:06.349 --> 02:38:07.710]  I have all the articles.
[02:38:07.710 --> 02:38:12.429]  I tried to go to Project Veritas about my Masonic infiltration.
[02:38:12.429 --> 02:38:16.429]  I signed their informant contract, which I still have, and I can prove that to you, and
[02:38:16.429 --> 02:38:17.750]  I can bring it.
[02:38:17.750 --> 02:38:22.990]  But Project Veritas, their board decided to turn down my case because, and I quote, it's
[02:38:22.990 --> 02:38:23.990]  a rabbit hole.
[02:38:23.990 --> 02:38:24.990]  We don't want to go down.
[02:38:24.990 --> 02:38:25.990]  Okay.
[02:38:25.990 --> 02:38:26.990]  Well, can I talk now?
[02:38:26.990 --> 02:38:27.990]  Absolutely.
[02:38:27.990 --> 02:38:28.990]  Okay.
[02:38:28.990 --> 02:38:31.550]  Well, thank you very much.
[02:38:31.550 --> 02:38:34.630]  I do remember you, and I do know your dad co-wrote that book with Gary Allen that's
[02:38:34.630 --> 02:38:36.550]  a seminal, very important book.
[02:38:36.550 --> 02:38:41.990]  I do remember interviewing you, and then I remember just getting some weird feedback or
[02:38:41.990 --> 02:38:44.949]  you were mad at us or something, and I really still don't pay attention to that stuff.
[02:38:44.949 --> 02:38:47.109]  I got a lot of stuff going on.
[02:38:47.109 --> 02:38:50.269]  And I know that going back to Solomon's Temple, Masonry and all that, it's pretty much the
[02:38:50.269 --> 02:38:51.269]  same deal.
[02:38:51.269 --> 02:38:55.550]  It goes back to Egypt, but the Babylonians, it was all basically the same mystery religions
[02:38:55.550 --> 02:38:57.589]  of all those groups.
[02:38:57.589 --> 02:39:02.109]  I know about George Washington's writings about the bad guys taking over Masonry and
[02:39:02.109 --> 02:39:03.710]  the rest of it.
[02:39:03.710 --> 02:39:07.390]  So there's different arms of this system.
[02:39:07.390 --> 02:39:14.109]  And you've seen Kanye West here on the show going off on his Hitler thing.
[02:39:14.109 --> 02:39:16.550]  I disagree with that.
[02:39:16.550 --> 02:39:23.589]  And of course, I think Hitler had his own occultic competing system to all of this.
[02:39:23.589 --> 02:39:31.470]  But just because somebody goes and gets involved with different Masonic organizations and reads
[02:39:31.470 --> 02:39:34.669]  the books they've got there, I've not been in those Masonic halls, but I know they've
[02:39:34.669 --> 02:39:35.669]  got big libraries.
[02:39:35.669 --> 02:39:40.750]  I've read books about what they have, and it's all sorts of stuff from black magic.
[02:39:40.750 --> 02:39:47.630]  It's like a suppository or repository of all the forbidden stuff the church wouldn't let
[02:39:47.630 --> 02:39:48.630]  you have.
[02:39:48.669 --> 02:39:54.509]  Because it predates the Christian church, the Orthodox and Catholic church.
[02:39:54.509 --> 02:39:56.789]  And so that's what it's got.
[02:39:56.789 --> 02:39:57.789]  So absolutely.
[02:39:57.789 --> 02:40:01.550]  I mean, I know they've got satanic manuscripts, you name it.
[02:40:01.550 --> 02:40:07.589]  We've gotten reporters in that we paid before to get into the Getty archives, and we did
[02:40:07.589 --> 02:40:08.589]  reports on that.
[02:40:08.589 --> 02:40:10.869]  So I've done some of the similar things.
[02:40:10.869 --> 02:40:14.230]  If you came to my house, I don't think in the house I live in now because I've read those
[02:40:14.230 --> 02:40:16.070]  books so long ago that they're in storage.
[02:40:16.070 --> 02:40:19.589]  But I mean, I've got like grand grimoire, black magic books.
[02:40:19.589 --> 02:40:21.910]  I've got Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf.
[02:40:21.910 --> 02:40:26.150]  I've got book stuff written by Julius Caesar.
[02:40:26.150 --> 02:40:27.869]  I've got writings of Napoleon Bonaparte.
[02:40:27.869 --> 02:40:31.789]  It's like I was going to read some of Napoleon Bonaparte's writings today, but I ran out of
[02:40:31.789 --> 02:40:32.789]  time.
[02:40:32.789 --> 02:40:33.789]  I actually have them right here.
[02:40:33.789 --> 02:40:36.189]  But that doesn't mean I agree with Napoleon Bonaparte's writings.
[02:40:36.189 --> 02:40:40.349]  And by the way, I'm not an apologist for the Masons.
[02:40:40.349 --> 02:40:43.750]  If the Masons claim that they tried to found this country, they're trying to save freedom.
[02:40:44.269 --> 02:40:46.550]  They've really been asleep on the job.
[02:40:46.550 --> 02:40:55.869]  And so when you say globalism is what the globalist Anglo-American-British combine USMI6
[02:40:55.869 --> 02:41:01.910]  slash Israel's a spinoff, Mossad-CIA combine calls itself.
[02:41:01.910 --> 02:41:04.269]  So globalists want a global government run by them.
[02:41:04.269 --> 02:41:06.710]  It doesn't mean they're internationalist.
[02:41:06.710 --> 02:41:08.589]  It doesn't even mean they're a citizen of the world.
[02:41:08.589 --> 02:41:11.589]  That all sounds interesting.
[02:41:11.589 --> 02:41:15.470]  They are wanting a centralized world government.
[02:41:15.470 --> 02:41:19.310]  And I guess they taught you at this lodge, the secret is, is that Lucifer is the Morning
[02:41:19.310 --> 02:41:20.310]  Star.
[02:41:20.310 --> 02:41:24.029]  And of course they refer to Christ in the Bible as the Morning Star as well.
[02:41:24.029 --> 02:41:25.589]  And you know, all the rest of that.
[02:41:25.589 --> 02:41:28.890]  So you're welcome to talk about that stuff.
[02:41:28.890 --> 02:41:32.990]  But just calling up and saying you want to debate with me, skip this break, just by calling
[02:41:32.990 --> 02:41:39.029]  up and saying you want a debate with me, I'm not going to let you define the parameters
[02:41:39.029 --> 02:41:40.029]  of what that debate is.
[02:41:40.029 --> 02:41:42.949]  Because I don't think I'm even debating what you're saying.
[02:41:42.949 --> 02:41:47.470]  If you want to put a written report together with some images in it or something you're
[02:41:47.470 --> 02:41:50.830]  talking about and email it to us, I might be interested in talking to you.
[02:41:50.830 --> 02:41:54.470]  But not if I'm being beaten over the head that I'm covering things up and, you know,
[02:41:54.470 --> 02:41:57.910]  you're the anointed one that's going to.
[02:41:57.910 --> 02:41:58.910]  So that's where I'm at.
[02:41:58.910 --> 02:42:00.390]  Do you want to respond now?
[02:42:00.390 --> 02:42:01.390]  Yeah.
[02:42:01.390 --> 02:42:07.630]  I never said I was the anointed one, even though you called me that on your 2012 interview.
[02:42:07.630 --> 02:42:09.630]  I called you the anointed one.
[02:42:09.630 --> 02:42:10.630]  Oh, really?
[02:42:10.630 --> 02:42:11.630]  Wow.
[02:42:11.630 --> 02:42:12.630]  We're learning more here.
[02:42:12.630 --> 02:42:13.630]  OK, so please.
[02:42:13.630 --> 02:42:14.630]  And I called you the Easter Bunny, too.
[02:42:14.630 --> 02:42:15.630]  So what else?
[02:42:15.630 --> 02:42:16.630]  I'm done talking.
[02:42:16.630 --> 02:42:17.630]  I'm done talking.
[02:42:17.630 --> 02:42:18.630]  I'm done talking.
[02:42:18.630 --> 02:42:19.630]  Thanks for the call.
[02:42:19.630 --> 02:42:20.630]  I got to get to everybody else, man.
[02:42:20.630 --> 02:42:26.789]  I mean, I just there's always these personalities that don't want to talk about the information.
[02:42:26.789 --> 02:42:30.509]  I mean, are a bunch of the Masonic lodges worshiping Lucifer?
[02:42:30.509 --> 02:42:31.509]  Yeah.
[02:42:31.509 --> 02:42:35.189]  Is that the 33rd degree or even the 32nd degree?
[02:42:35.189 --> 02:42:36.189]  Yeah.
[02:42:36.189 --> 02:42:37.189]  OK.
[02:42:37.189 --> 02:42:38.189]  And that's the whole paradox of the thing.
[02:42:38.869 --> 02:42:42.949]  And then there's all these idiots online that go, Alex Jones did this with his hand.
[02:42:42.949 --> 02:42:44.349]  That's an Illuminati symbol.
[02:42:44.349 --> 02:42:47.109]  No, you put your index finger with your thumb.
[02:42:47.109 --> 02:42:51.550]  It's known psychologically and in studies to make your brainwaves even operate better.
[02:42:51.550 --> 02:42:54.869]  Or like when you squeeze your fist together, it makes you think of fighting.
[02:42:54.869 --> 02:43:01.269]  The rainbow is in Genesis as God's promise not to destroy the earth again with water.
[02:43:01.269 --> 02:43:04.789]  People ask, you made a NASA shirt, it has a rainbow on it.
[02:43:04.789 --> 02:43:08.150]  It's a copy of a NASA shirt from the 70s.
[02:43:08.150 --> 02:43:09.910]  The rainbow is not bad.
[02:43:09.910 --> 02:43:13.310]  I will use it if I want to.
[02:43:13.310 --> 02:43:16.269]  And so, again, you go off the fruits of what somebody does.
[02:43:16.269 --> 02:43:18.830]  You go off what they promote, which is freedom.
[02:43:18.830 --> 02:43:22.150]  And then with everything we do is not occulted.
[02:43:22.150 --> 02:43:25.169]  Nothing we do here is hidden.
[02:43:25.169 --> 02:43:26.349]  My name is Alex Jones.
[02:43:26.349 --> 02:43:27.429]  That's my real name.
[02:43:27.429 --> 02:43:31.230]  What we cover is real issues where you can go check out almost everything we talk about
[02:43:31.230 --> 02:43:32.230]  and we do here.
[02:43:32.230 --> 02:43:34.310]  When I'm giving you opinion, I'll tell you it's opinion.
[02:43:34.310 --> 02:43:38.710]  But I'm not going to, when a call comes out, I am the son of this, and this is the way
[02:43:38.710 --> 02:43:43.949]  this is, and I want to debate you, and you are going to such and such, all the rest of
[02:43:43.949 --> 02:43:44.949]  it.
[02:43:44.949 --> 02:43:49.029]  And see, I just vaguely remember all that stuff, and I just can't handle it.
[02:43:49.029 --> 02:43:53.550]  I've been around too much craziness, and I just, I do my show, I do my research, I go
[02:43:53.550 --> 02:43:54.550]  home to my family.
[02:43:54.550 --> 02:43:55.550]  And that's it.
[02:43:55.550 --> 02:43:57.869]  I don't even really hang out with people anymore, any of that.
[02:43:57.869 --> 02:44:03.390]  I'm just, I'm like a hermit or something that just carries out the mission and that's it.
[02:44:03.750 --> 02:44:05.150]  All right, appreciate your call.
[02:44:05.150 --> 02:44:08.710]  All right, Peter in Puerto Rico, thanks for holding, go ahead.
[02:44:08.710 --> 02:44:09.710]  Hi, hello.
[02:44:09.710 --> 02:44:12.109]  Thank you, Alex, for taking the call.
[02:44:12.109 --> 02:44:14.150]  I'm here in Puerto Rico, Jalco.
[02:44:14.150 --> 02:44:20.070]  I want to talk about, like, generally human trafficking, because you saw Haiti, the Dominican
[02:44:20.070 --> 02:44:24.750]  Republic, which is owned by the EU and NATO, Cuba, which is Russia, which you won't see
[02:44:24.750 --> 02:44:29.349]  any news from it because of, like, the great firewall that prevents any information from
[02:44:29.349 --> 02:44:30.349]  coming here.
[02:44:30.349 --> 02:44:34.630]  And then the silent place, Puerto Rico, that's owned by the Democratic Party, that's been
[02:44:34.630 --> 02:44:36.949]  like that since, like, the mid-50s.
[02:44:36.949 --> 02:44:43.869]  We've been voting for the same unit party for decades, almost generations worth of people.
[02:44:43.869 --> 02:44:49.669]  You make children, you get paid for it through the social security system, those kids disappear.
[02:44:49.669 --> 02:44:51.789]  Nobody ever bats an eye about it.
[02:44:51.789 --> 02:44:56.789]  Women, children, whole bunch of people here disappear through concerts, vicariously through
[02:44:56.789 --> 02:45:05.349]  hotels, which is usually the more larger facet, or LGBT, I guess, conditioning, because
[02:45:05.349 --> 02:45:10.029]  we're, you know, since CNN says that sex trafficking is not real.
[02:45:10.029 --> 02:45:12.589]  But I think you can re-educate children, right?
[02:45:12.589 --> 02:45:14.830]  So re-education or LGBT plus.
[02:45:14.830 --> 02:45:15.830]  Well, that's right.
[02:45:15.830 --> 02:45:21.070]  The whole LGBT thing and all the TSA-groping kids, psychologists admit, is priming them
[02:45:21.070 --> 02:45:22.589]  for sex abuse.
[02:45:22.589 --> 02:45:23.589]  Indeed.
[02:45:23.589 --> 02:45:30.390]  And over here, there's tourism for that, or adults only, or with children, LGBT pro plus
[02:45:30.390 --> 02:45:32.710]  areas, or gay tourism.
[02:45:32.710 --> 02:45:35.869]  It's another form and facet of sex tourism.
[02:45:35.869 --> 02:45:43.390]  You know, come to the island, spend your big money, have, you know, illicit actions with
[02:45:43.390 --> 02:45:46.869]  people that are forced to do so.
[02:45:46.869 --> 02:45:49.789]  And since in Puerto Rico you don't need a passport to come over here, it's very easy
[02:45:49.789 --> 02:45:55.109]  to fake IDs, very easy to fake papers, you know, because going to Haiti, you still need
[02:45:55.109 --> 02:45:56.109]  a passport.
[02:45:56.109 --> 02:45:57.830]  There's still like a digital trail.
[02:45:57.830 --> 02:46:02.349]  Even though it can be falsified and faked, it's a lot easier to come to Puerto Rico.
[02:46:02.349 --> 02:46:03.349]  Well, that's right.
[02:46:03.349 --> 02:46:07.550]  I mean, it's come out that a lot of the Democrats particularly use the Caribbean for this, and
[02:46:07.550 --> 02:46:08.550]  we know about it.
[02:46:08.550 --> 02:46:09.550]  It came out.
[02:46:09.550 --> 02:46:14.230]  Of course, it's in Tim Ballard's powerful film, The Sound of Freedom.
[02:46:14.230 --> 02:46:15.230]  Real stories.
[02:46:15.230 --> 02:46:16.230]  They used islands there.
[02:46:16.230 --> 02:46:18.869]  We know about Little St. John's, real islands there.
[02:46:18.949 --> 02:46:23.230]  And so I've read that about Puerto Rico, that it's really bad, and because they control
[02:46:23.230 --> 02:46:26.710]  the police and other things, children just disappear, and it's something that you know
[02:46:26.710 --> 02:46:29.349]  to keep on the DL.
[02:46:29.349 --> 02:46:33.990]  It's kind of like, we call it here the invisible crime.
[02:46:33.990 --> 02:46:36.910]  Everybody knows about it, but nobody can see it, right?
[02:46:36.910 --> 02:46:43.230]  Everyone's people kind of just vanishes, little girls, kids, adult teenage men, adult teenage
[02:46:43.230 --> 02:46:44.230]  girls.
[02:46:44.230 --> 02:46:47.830]  And then what happens is that, you know, they end up giving excuses that they get found
[02:46:47.830 --> 02:46:51.109]  in the United States, and then you just never hear about them again.
[02:46:51.109 --> 02:46:53.349]  You know, complete families are just destroyed.
[02:46:53.349 --> 02:46:55.949]  Oh, my child left for the United States.
[02:46:55.949 --> 02:46:58.070]  Nobody backs an eye about it.
[02:46:58.070 --> 02:47:00.349]  Entire groups of people just being vanished.
[02:47:00.349 --> 02:47:01.349]  There's towns...
[02:47:01.349 --> 02:47:02.349]  And you claim, oh, they ran away.
[02:47:02.349 --> 02:47:05.949]  Well, I mean, that's how the UN did it, and that's how these big, it's the same thing
[02:47:05.949 --> 02:47:06.949]  you see in The Sound of Freedom.
[02:47:06.949 --> 02:47:07.949]  This has been going on forever.
[02:47:07.949 --> 02:47:13.910]  They'll tell like an 11-year-old girl at school, you know, the local soda shop or whatever
[02:47:13.910 --> 02:47:16.070]  in Eastern Europe, hey, you want money?
[02:47:16.070 --> 02:47:17.070]  You want a job?
[02:47:17.070 --> 02:47:18.910]  You want a beauty pageant today at this hotel?
[02:47:18.910 --> 02:47:19.910]  Come here.
[02:47:19.910 --> 02:47:23.789]  And then they do the same thing, take pictures of them, get them ready, boom, drug them,
[02:47:23.789 --> 02:47:28.349]  put them in a truck, fly them out on a private jet, they are gone.
[02:47:28.349 --> 02:47:30.390]  And the ones that go along with it live.
[02:47:30.390 --> 02:47:36.630]  The big dirty secret is they kill a large portion of the kids that don't go along.
[02:47:36.630 --> 02:47:39.150]  Well, because, you know, people are resistant to that.
[02:47:39.150 --> 02:47:40.789]  That's the light of God.
[02:47:40.789 --> 02:47:42.029]  Like people don't want to do that.
[02:47:42.029 --> 02:47:43.669]  That's the stealing of innocence.
[02:47:43.669 --> 02:47:46.470]  That's why the gay bomb was first dropped on the church.
[02:47:46.470 --> 02:47:51.630]  If you can disallude people to the fact that pedophilia equals church, right?
[02:47:51.630 --> 02:47:54.710]  Everyone makes the Catholic priest joke.
[02:47:54.710 --> 02:47:59.509]  If we can, if we can connect the most atrocious thing that you can do to a human.
[02:47:59.509 --> 02:48:00.509]  No, that's it.
[02:48:00.509 --> 02:48:03.509]  That's how they take over every, Boy Scouts, I remember 10 years ago, they were handing
[02:48:03.509 --> 02:48:08.669]  out condoms to even eight-year-olds at the, quote, jubilee of the Boy Scouts.
[02:48:08.669 --> 02:48:10.789]  And then it bankrupted the Boy Scouts and got taken over.
[02:48:10.789 --> 02:48:12.429]  That was a total plan.
[02:48:12.429 --> 02:48:17.669]  And that's all this LGBT PS thing is, is a Trojan horse.
[02:48:17.669 --> 02:48:18.669]  I'm 30.
[02:48:18.669 --> 02:48:19.669]  You know, I'm in my mid thirties.
[02:48:19.669 --> 02:48:23.669]  I saw this through the Catholic church in my local area.
[02:48:23.669 --> 02:48:26.230]  You know, you start seeing scandals, right?
[02:48:26.230 --> 02:48:30.710]  Like all these priests touch this, this priest, that, and there was like generally new priests,
[02:48:30.710 --> 02:48:34.109]  people who came into the area, nobody's asking, why are they getting recruited?
[02:48:34.109 --> 02:48:35.109]  Who's bringing them in?
[02:48:35.109 --> 02:48:36.109]  Who's protecting them?
[02:48:36.109 --> 02:48:37.109]  Why are they moving them around?
[02:48:37.109 --> 02:48:38.550]  And they're there to destroy the church.
[02:48:38.550 --> 02:48:39.550]  I agree with you.
[02:48:39.550 --> 02:48:41.789]  But I am seeing a lot of people from what I've read.
[02:48:41.789 --> 02:48:42.789]  I've never been to Puerto Rico.
[02:48:42.789 --> 02:48:46.230]  I like to visit sometime, that people are starting to wake up in Puerto Rico.
[02:48:46.230 --> 02:48:49.789]  Oh, dude, it's, it's, it's a, this has been the Republican nation.
[02:48:49.789 --> 02:48:53.789]  We have a holiday, the 27th of July, Barbosa Day.
[02:48:53.789 --> 02:48:58.509]  It was a doctor who was in the mid 18th century to, he died in 1920.
[02:48:58.509 --> 02:49:03.990]  He was the spearhead of what statehood or Republican nationalism for Puerto Rico is.
[02:49:03.990 --> 02:49:05.589]  We do not like democracy.
[02:49:05.589 --> 02:49:07.429]  That is mob rule.
[02:49:07.429 --> 02:49:11.390]  That is who has the most, who has the voice and who yells the loudest.
[02:49:11.390 --> 02:49:16.910]  And then, and the minority and the people who suffer the most are dragging the chains.
[02:49:16.910 --> 02:49:22.869]  Those who worship the, I guess, the hierarchy or the oligarchy of Europe or the olden families,
[02:49:22.869 --> 02:49:23.869]  the Vanderbilt.
[02:49:23.869 --> 02:49:24.869]  All right.
[02:49:24.869 --> 02:49:25.869]  Got to jump.
[02:49:25.869 --> 02:49:26.869]  Great points.
[02:49:26.869 --> 02:49:27.869]  Carlos in Houston.
[02:49:27.869 --> 02:49:28.869]  Thanks for holding your ear on the air.
[02:49:28.869 --> 02:49:29.869]  Yeah.
[02:49:29.869 --> 02:49:33.070]  Like, it's always good to talk to you.
[02:49:33.070 --> 02:49:34.070]  I saw the movie.
[02:49:34.070 --> 02:49:36.589]  It was very riveting.
[02:49:36.589 --> 02:49:47.109]  I also saw a freaking interview where Jim Caviezel was talking with, with the, with,
[02:49:47.109 --> 02:49:51.390]  with the other buddy, with the, with the same show called the war room, like Owen, what's
[02:49:51.390 --> 02:49:52.390]  his name?
[02:49:52.390 --> 02:49:53.390]  Steve Bannon.
[02:49:53.390 --> 02:49:54.390]  Steve Bannon.
[02:49:54.390 --> 02:50:01.910]  And, and they were talking about, he was making, I don't know if assertions or maybe he's seen
[02:50:01.910 --> 02:50:09.410]  some data that was collected by, by, by that team that, that was, that's been rescuing
[02:50:09.410 --> 02:50:10.410]  all these kids.
[02:50:10.410 --> 02:50:15.609]  But they were talking about how whenever the kids are killed, a lot of that biological
[02:50:15.609 --> 02:50:22.109]  material ends up in all these different bio labs, which you alluded to earlier.
[02:50:22.109 --> 02:50:28.230]  And also they've, they've heard the word Ambrosia in the past, which is what they call adrenochrome
[02:50:28.230 --> 02:50:34.829]  in that people, adrenochrome is a term, mostly the pituitary gland or the adrenal gland,
[02:50:34.829 --> 02:50:40.869]  the blood of that Ambrosia is an ancient term for drinking blood of children that was done
[02:50:40.869 --> 02:50:43.769]  in black Sabbaths and black masses.
[02:50:43.769 --> 02:50:49.990]  So that's in thousand year old satanic books that, that, that's, that, that's in museums
[02:50:49.990 --> 02:50:56.429]  that, that they would you seem like in vampire movies, Dracula will get a baby and he'll
[02:50:56.429 --> 02:51:00.310]  bring it to his women and they will all bite it and drink its blood.
[02:51:00.310 --> 02:51:05.189]  That's a black Sabbath is they Lance the child, drink its blood, have sex in the blood, torture
[02:51:05.189 --> 02:51:10.509]  the child for about a day and then cut it up and eat it raw in a sex orgy.
[02:51:10.509 --> 02:51:12.029]  So yeah, it's called Ambrosia.
[02:51:12.029 --> 02:51:14.750]  That's all completely real.
[02:51:14.750 --> 02:51:21.230]  So the main reason why these people, the media themselves, they're the main ones that are
[02:51:21.230 --> 02:51:24.029]  probably more than likely, I'm not accusing anybody.
[02:51:24.029 --> 02:51:31.829]  But that guy that was taking a little Osito across the border, he looks like you're quitting.
[02:51:31.829 --> 02:51:34.750]  They couldn't have chosen a more perfect person to play that guy.
[02:51:34.750 --> 02:51:39.550]  It was like your quintessential example of what a pedal looks like and the, and the guy
[02:51:39.550 --> 02:51:44.189]  at the beginning of the movie, those guys, I don't know, I don't know where they did
[02:51:44.189 --> 02:51:47.750]  their casting yet, but they, they did a wonderful job.
[02:51:47.750 --> 02:51:54.109]  Now the other part of that is, I remember, and I heard this on, on, on your show probably
[02:51:54.109 --> 02:52:00.910]  about about eight years ago, the company called Ambrosia, the one that was, uh, that was the
[02:52:00.910 --> 02:52:05.150]  one that was going to get blood from kids and give it to people.
[02:52:05.150 --> 02:52:06.150]  Yeah.
[02:52:06.150 --> 02:52:07.150]  Yes.
[02:52:07.150 --> 02:52:09.550]  And so, so we, they can't lose that pipeline.
[02:52:09.550 --> 02:52:12.869]  That's the only thing that's keeping these damn mummies alive.
[02:52:12.869 --> 02:52:16.849]  So, so they have to try to discredit anything that's good.
[02:52:16.849 --> 02:52:21.070]  Anything that's going against them, that's going to take away that food supply.
[02:52:21.070 --> 02:52:24.390]  Now, now my mother-in-law lives in El Paso.
[02:52:24.390 --> 02:52:30.910]  She says that things are the worst that they've been just in the past two or three months and
[02:52:30.910 --> 02:52:31.910]  even worse.
[02:52:31.910 --> 02:52:37.990]  Now, now since that rule about, about them not having a, a, a, a, do the blood test on
[02:52:37.990 --> 02:52:43.710]  the kids and on the family members, my mother-in-law says that they are being bombarded and flooded.
[02:52:43.710 --> 02:52:46.109]  There's nowhere to stay there.
[02:52:46.109 --> 02:52:47.869]  It's totally, it's totally broken.
[02:52:47.869 --> 02:52:54.550]  And again, why would Obama, Biden say, she, my brain is like, I can't have real trouble
[02:52:54.550 --> 02:52:55.550]  telling a lie.
[02:52:55.550 --> 02:52:57.509]  So even the president is Biden, but it is Obama.
[02:52:57.509 --> 02:53:02.630]  So I can't say Biden because it is Obama.
[02:53:02.630 --> 02:53:05.630]  And they literally do not, when they don't even know, like a man shows up with little
[02:53:05.630 --> 02:53:07.109]  kids, it doesn't even look like him.
[02:53:07.230 --> 02:53:08.230]  There's no ID.
[02:53:08.230 --> 02:53:09.230]  They can, they do a test.
[02:53:09.230 --> 02:53:10.230]  They don't even do that now.
[02:53:10.230 --> 02:53:12.990]  I mean, think that is the government running children.
[02:53:12.990 --> 02:53:13.990]  God bless you, brother.
[02:53:13.990 --> 02:53:17.070]  I'm sorry to hear about that's happening and hopefully your mother and people can speak
[02:53:17.070 --> 02:53:19.109]  out against it.
[02:53:19.109 --> 02:53:21.150]  It's hard to even take these calls, isn't it?
[02:53:21.150 --> 02:53:25.029]  Can you imagine working down there on the border?
[02:53:25.029 --> 02:53:26.029]  It's just pure evil.
[02:53:26.029 --> 02:53:27.509]  Jason in Texas, you're on the air.
[02:53:27.509 --> 02:53:28.509]  Go ahead.
[02:53:28.509 --> 02:53:29.509]  Hey, Alex.
[02:53:29.509 --> 02:53:30.509]  Yes, sir.
[02:53:30.509 --> 02:53:31.509]  Go ahead.
[02:53:31.509 --> 02:53:34.509]  I just want to say what a great job, obviously.
[02:53:34.509 --> 02:53:39.630]  I mean, I've talked to you many a time, but I'm a listener to everything you do is just,
[02:53:39.630 --> 02:53:40.630]  it's working.
[02:53:40.630 --> 02:53:41.630]  It's working out perfectly.
[02:53:41.630 --> 02:53:42.630]  All of this.
[02:53:42.630 --> 02:53:43.630]  It's all coming together.
[02:53:43.630 --> 02:53:44.630]  Just like God has a plan.
[02:53:44.630 --> 02:53:45.630]  It's not us, brother.
[02:53:45.630 --> 02:53:48.630]  The Lord works in mysterious ways.
[02:53:48.630 --> 02:53:49.630]  Absolutely.
[02:53:49.630 --> 02:53:51.829]  I mean, we got these people on the ropes.
[02:53:51.829 --> 02:53:52.829]  They're running scared.
[02:53:52.829 --> 02:53:58.029]  You know, they're doing hit pieces on this movie, trying to say it's all phony and conspiracy
[02:53:58.029 --> 02:53:59.029]  theory.
[02:53:59.029 --> 02:54:00.029]  They're full of crap.
[02:54:00.029 --> 02:54:01.029]  And we got them.
[02:54:01.029 --> 02:54:02.029]  We got them running.
[02:54:02.029 --> 02:54:03.029]  We got it.
[02:54:03.550 --> 02:54:07.269]  The only thing phony about the movie is that it's a million times worse, but I'm not attacking
[02:54:07.269 --> 02:54:08.269]  the movie.
[02:54:08.269 --> 02:54:11.150]  I would have done the same way because you, you, you, you, it's so big.
[02:54:11.150 --> 02:54:13.869]  You got to focus only a few kids to personalize it.
[02:54:13.869 --> 02:54:16.910]  But the only problem with the movie is it, it's, it's, it's much worse.
[02:54:16.910 --> 02:54:17.910]  Exactly.
[02:54:17.910 --> 02:54:21.710]  And I just want to give a quick shout out quick.
[02:54:21.710 --> 02:54:22.829]  I called Sunday night.
[02:54:22.829 --> 02:54:23.949]  I talked to Owen.
[02:54:23.949 --> 02:54:25.390]  I want to thank Drew.
[02:54:25.390 --> 02:54:28.429]  I want to thank Henry and I want to thank Ellis.
[02:54:28.429 --> 02:54:29.429]  They helped me.
[02:54:29.429 --> 02:54:30.429]  They all helped me out.
[02:54:30.429 --> 02:54:31.429]  I was in speed.
[02:54:31.429 --> 02:54:32.429]  Still kind of am.
[02:54:32.829 --> 02:54:33.829]  I've got out there.
[02:54:33.829 --> 02:54:34.829]  Jason Lawler, nine.
[02:54:34.829 --> 02:54:35.829]  I'm Benmo.
[02:54:35.829 --> 02:54:36.829]  I'm living in my car.
[02:54:36.829 --> 02:54:46.269]  My, I lost my job to a legal aliens and yeah, if long time listener, any info where he wants
[02:54:46.269 --> 02:54:48.990]  to help out, I'm not begging, I just ask him.
[02:54:48.990 --> 02:54:54.189]  So that's why we got to start building communities during the collapse and, and just say no Satan
[02:54:54.189 --> 02:54:55.189]  worshipers allowed.
[02:54:55.189 --> 02:54:59.630]  And under the first amendment, we can form churches that allow us to be only amongst
[02:54:59.630 --> 02:55:01.310]  our own people of every race, color, and creed.
[02:55:02.310 --> 02:55:05.109]  We're going to have to declare it folks and just a hundred percent get with Christians
[02:55:05.109 --> 02:55:07.869]  because you're either going to be a Christian or you're going to be with the devil.
[02:55:07.869 --> 02:55:10.509]  I mean, that's just the way it's going to be soon.
[02:55:10.509 --> 02:55:12.150]  Thank you, Jason.
[02:55:12.150 --> 02:55:13.990]  Let's go to Jared in Missouri.
[02:55:13.990 --> 02:55:14.990]  Thanks for holding.
[02:55:14.990 --> 02:55:15.990]  Go ahead.
[02:55:15.990 --> 02:55:16.990]  Hey, be honest with me.
[02:55:16.990 --> 02:55:19.990]  How many times did you tear up in that movie?
[02:55:19.990 --> 02:55:20.990]  How many times I what?
[02:55:20.990 --> 02:55:21.990]  Tear up.
[02:55:21.990 --> 02:55:24.590]  Oh, I mean, I teared up a lot.
[02:55:24.590 --> 02:55:28.710]  I'm a, I'm a big, I mean, it was terrible because I have children and also know how real
[02:55:28.710 --> 02:55:29.710]  all this is.
[02:55:29.710 --> 02:55:33.590]  I also know they kill a lot of kids, so I realized as bad as the movie was, it was far
[02:55:33.590 --> 02:55:34.590]  worse.
[02:55:34.590 --> 02:55:35.590]  Absolutely.
[02:55:35.590 --> 02:55:36.590]  I didn't.
[02:55:36.590 --> 02:55:39.470]  It's a miracle that, uh, go figure the name of the studio that came out with it was angel
[02:55:39.470 --> 02:55:41.869]  studios and how it was going to get buried by Disney.
[02:55:41.869 --> 02:55:45.550]  And I think this is going to be the movie, uh, everybody listening to my voice and your
[02:55:45.550 --> 02:55:50.470]  voice, uh, uh, for many years, um, knows that the fact of the matter is we all know this,
[02:55:50.470 --> 02:55:54.750]  but a lot of people, like you said, too many numbers, too many, you know, things, so it
[02:55:54.750 --> 02:55:55.869]  doesn't really personalize it.
[02:55:55.869 --> 02:55:57.590]  I think this movie did an excellent job of that.
[02:55:57.590 --> 02:55:59.369]  I'm going to take my, my children as well.
[02:55:59.369 --> 02:56:03.269]  My two daughters and I have a son that we're going to go check it out.
[02:56:03.269 --> 02:56:04.269]  That's a good point.
[02:56:04.269 --> 02:56:07.669]  Even though this scares children, I think people should take young children as young
[02:56:07.669 --> 02:56:11.669]  as five or six to this because they need to know how dangerous the predators are.
[02:56:11.669 --> 02:56:16.590]  All this pedo LGBT stuff to train your kids to get kidnapped or recruited in and then
[02:56:16.590 --> 02:56:17.590]  they don't have to kidnap.
[02:56:17.590 --> 02:56:19.230]  They've already got them and you don't know.
[02:56:19.230 --> 02:56:22.230]  People need to take them to this and connect to the LGBT thing.
[02:56:22.230 --> 02:56:23.230]  Yeah.
[02:56:23.230 --> 02:56:24.829]  There wasn't a dry eye in the theater.
[02:56:24.829 --> 02:56:25.829]  It was packed.
[02:56:25.869 --> 02:56:28.390]  I've heard a lot of people getting, you know, refunded and keep fighting.
[02:56:28.390 --> 02:56:32.630]  I recommend everybody who is my voice to go see the movie, uh, spread the word, tell people
[02:56:32.630 --> 02:56:34.230]  about it cause they really can't help.
[02:56:34.230 --> 02:56:36.630]  I think this can bring down the whole thing, man, be honest with you.
[02:56:36.630 --> 02:56:39.829]  Because once people start feeling the way we already knew, like I already knew about
[02:56:39.829 --> 02:56:45.349]  this stuff myself too, but being a catalyst to break their back and that's why when you
[02:56:45.349 --> 02:56:50.349]  look at CNN or ABC or MSNBC, they look scared, don't they?
[02:56:50.349 --> 02:56:51.349]  Yup.
[02:56:51.349 --> 02:56:53.470]  Cause they know, they know who they work for.
[02:56:53.470 --> 02:56:57.070]  And they also, uh, funny thing is, uh, QAnon didn't even exist when he was doing all this
[02:56:57.070 --> 02:56:58.070]  either.
[02:56:58.070 --> 02:57:01.269]  So the fact that they have to divert it to that, obviously the more, the more stuff
[02:57:01.269 --> 02:57:04.630]  they say like that, the more I'm interested in, in actually going and seeing the truth.
[02:57:04.630 --> 02:57:05.630]  And I know.
[02:57:05.630 --> 02:57:06.630]  Oh yeah.
[02:57:06.630 --> 02:57:07.630]  QAnon came along to people.
[02:57:07.630 --> 02:57:11.590]  People would see me on the street and go, I'm with Q, he exposes a kid to the Bilderberg
[02:57:11.590 --> 02:57:12.590]  group.
[02:57:12.590 --> 02:57:14.470]  And I'm like, I was exposed to the Bilderberg group 25 years ago.
[02:57:14.470 --> 02:57:19.349]  So they, it was just a way we'd wake people up and the CIA had to, had to get a way to
[02:57:19.349 --> 02:57:20.349]  get them back.
[02:57:20.349 --> 02:57:21.349]  You see?
[02:57:21.349 --> 02:57:22.349]  And that's what they did.
[02:57:22.349 --> 02:57:23.349]  Everybody knows it's BS now.
[02:57:23.349 --> 02:57:24.349]  All right.
[02:57:24.349 --> 02:57:25.349]  Appreciate your call.
[02:57:25.349 --> 02:57:26.349]  God bless you.
[02:57:26.349 --> 02:57:27.349]  All right.
[02:57:27.349 --> 02:57:28.349]  Paris, Victor, Evan, Stacey.
[02:57:28.349 --> 02:57:34.029]  I'm going to take your calls before the next guest host takes over.
[02:57:34.029 --> 02:57:36.910]  Really appreciate the crew, the fabulous job they've done.
[02:57:36.910 --> 02:57:41.109]  The amazing Kate Daly takes over, but I'm going to finish up some of your phone calls
[02:57:41.109 --> 02:57:42.109]  right now.
[02:57:42.109 --> 02:57:48.029]  Infowars.com is the coordinates of Liberty.
[02:57:48.029 --> 02:57:53.269]  With all the craziness in the world, the collapsing borders, the war with Russia, the
[02:57:53.269 --> 02:57:57.669]  insanity, the currency devaluations, the economy going crazy.
[02:57:57.669 --> 02:58:01.990]  You are crazy in my view, if you don't get high quality, storable food and water filtration
[02:58:01.990 --> 02:58:02.990]  and self-defense.
[02:58:02.990 --> 02:58:05.150]  Now we're not selling guns and ammo.
[02:58:05.150 --> 02:58:07.669]  That's for you to go out and get for yourself and learn how to use if you haven't.
[02:58:07.669 --> 02:58:09.710]  And I'm preaching the choir on that.
[02:58:09.710 --> 02:58:13.630]  But a lot of people got plenty of guns, but they don't have enough storable food or water
[02:58:13.630 --> 02:58:14.669]  filtration.
[02:58:14.669 --> 02:58:18.869]  This is something you need now, and we've got it in the food department and in the high

[02:59:47.829 --> 02:59:56.829]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:59:56.829 --> 03:00:04.829]  One of the things you've been talking about on your show is your allegation that government
[03:00:04.829 --> 03:00:09.829]  officials are aiding in pedophilia, child trafficking, and the grooming of children.
[03:00:09.829 --> 03:00:10.829]  Right?
[03:00:10.829 --> 03:00:13.829]  Well, you mean like what Jeffrey Epstein did with the clones?
[03:00:13.829 --> 03:00:27.829]  You know, I don't blame people that tune into this show and think it's nuts.
[03:00:27.829 --> 03:00:34.829]  I remember when Ted Gunderson, again, high level FBI, retired, told me 28 years ago,
[03:00:35.829 --> 03:00:39.829]  28 years ago, this was all going on.
[03:00:39.829 --> 03:00:43.829]  And then since then, 99% of what he said has turned out to be accurate.
[03:00:43.829 --> 03:00:45.829]  The guy has such credibility.
[03:00:45.829 --> 03:00:46.829]  What a great patriot.
[03:00:46.829 --> 03:00:49.829]  Imagine being him.
[03:00:49.829 --> 03:00:53.829]  He'd been in the FBI decades before he became the head FBI agent in Los Angeles.
[03:00:53.829 --> 03:00:55.829]  And he didn't believe it when people came to him.
[03:00:55.829 --> 03:00:59.829]  He went to disprove stuff he was told about murderers and devil worshipers and pedophiles.
[03:00:59.829 --> 03:01:01.829]  And he sure found out it was true.
[03:01:01.829 --> 03:01:03.829]  And he was like, what in the world?
[03:01:03.829 --> 03:01:08.829]  And then he suddenly was told, don't look into that.
[03:01:08.829 --> 03:01:09.829]  We don't have the resources for that.
[03:01:09.829 --> 03:01:12.829]  The public can't handle that.
[03:01:12.829 --> 03:01:14.829]  And he started finding out about everything.
[03:01:14.829 --> 03:01:18.829]  Manson and the CIA, Pentagon running secret operations.
[03:01:18.829 --> 03:01:19.829]  It's all a test.
[03:01:19.829 --> 03:01:24.829]  They use devil worshiping as a model, even though they believe in God, as a psychological
[03:01:24.829 --> 03:01:26.829]  model to see if you'll do really bad stuff.
[03:01:26.829 --> 03:01:29.829]  But basically, it's a template.
[03:01:29.829 --> 03:01:35.829]  That's why the organized gangs, the drug gangs, use shaitanism like MS-13 as a program.
[03:01:35.829 --> 03:01:37.829]  They're trying to see what you're willing to do.
[03:01:37.829 --> 03:01:38.829]  And it's very real, folks.
[03:01:38.829 --> 03:01:40.829]  And it's all come out.
[03:01:40.829 --> 03:01:45.829]  And to see the system desperately trying to block it right now is amazing.
[03:01:45.829 --> 03:01:49.829]  Paris in Arizona, thanks for holding her on the air.
[03:01:49.829 --> 03:01:52.829]  Scholar and gentlemen, thank you for everything that you've done.
[03:01:52.829 --> 03:01:54.829]  I know you hate it.
[03:01:54.829 --> 03:02:01.829]  Quick plug, your beard and hair will turn you into a Sasquatch.
[03:02:01.829 --> 03:02:03.829]  You know, the rats are leaving the sinking ship right now.
[03:02:03.829 --> 03:02:04.829]  I know that.
[03:02:04.829 --> 03:02:10.829]  And right now, when anybody is sinking in the water, they reach out for anybody to reach
[03:02:10.829 --> 03:02:12.829]  out and grab onto.
[03:02:12.829 --> 03:02:17.829]  I have nothing bad to say about, you know, the sound of freedom and what it's promoting
[03:02:17.829 --> 03:02:20.829]  in the country, because it's needed right now.
[03:02:20.829 --> 03:02:22.829]  I have a question for you.
[03:02:22.829 --> 03:02:28.829]  There is a gentleman by the name of Carlos Slim that Donald Trump was speaking about
[03:02:28.829 --> 03:02:29.829]  at one of his rallies.
[03:02:29.829 --> 03:02:35.829]  And does he have any involvement with the movement, with the movement Sound of Freedom?
[03:02:35.829 --> 03:02:38.829]  Do you know anything of that, sir?
[03:02:38.829 --> 03:02:40.829]  I have a pretty good memory.
[03:02:40.829 --> 03:02:44.829]  And Carlos Slim at one point was the richest man in the world.
[03:02:44.829 --> 03:02:45.829]  Correct.
[03:02:45.829 --> 03:02:46.829]  That's not his name.
[03:02:46.829 --> 03:02:48.829]  He's really Lebanese.
[03:02:49.829 --> 03:02:56.829]  And I've forgotten way more than I've, you know, I've forgotten more than most people
[03:02:56.829 --> 03:02:57.829]  know.
[03:02:59.829 --> 03:03:03.829]  But I do know he supplied the Obama phones to the poor and a bunch of other stuff.
[03:03:03.829 --> 03:03:09.829]  So, no, I don't know about Carlos Slim's connection to this, to pedophilia.
[03:03:09.829 --> 03:03:12.829]  I mean, I know about his connection to Obama.
[03:03:14.829 --> 03:03:15.829]  Yes, sir.
[03:03:15.829 --> 03:03:20.829]  I see an article here with Donald Trump saying Trump blames Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim
[03:03:20.829 --> 03:03:23.829]  for sexual misconduct stories.
[03:03:23.829 --> 03:03:28.829]  If you look into that and, you know, inform people about that, I would really appreciate
[03:03:28.829 --> 03:03:29.829]  that.
[03:03:29.829 --> 03:03:33.829]  And I live in Arizona and I'm heading to the border to film any and everything that I can.
[03:03:33.829 --> 03:03:36.829]  And I've been listening since the Jakari Jackson days.
[03:03:36.829 --> 03:03:41.829]  And if showtips.infowars.com is still up, I'll send any and everything I can to you.
[03:03:41.829 --> 03:03:42.829]  We need to check that more.
[03:03:42.829 --> 03:03:43.829]  We appreciate you.
[03:03:43.829 --> 03:03:44.829]  Boy, do I love Jakari Jackson.
[03:03:44.829 --> 03:03:47.829]  Ended up meeting the girl of his dreams in South Carolina.
[03:03:47.829 --> 03:03:48.829]  She didn't want to move.
[03:03:48.829 --> 03:03:49.829]  So that's why he quit.
[03:03:49.829 --> 03:03:50.829]  It was no hard feelings.
[03:03:50.829 --> 03:03:52.829]  But, man, he was a great reporter and a good friend.
[03:03:52.829 --> 03:03:53.829]  I miss him.
[03:03:53.829 --> 03:03:55.829]  We ought to see how Jakari Jackson's doing.
[03:03:55.829 --> 03:03:56.829]  Thank you so much, sir.
[03:03:56.829 --> 03:03:57.829]  All right.
[03:03:57.829 --> 03:03:58.829]  Victor, Evan, and Stacey.
[03:03:58.829 --> 03:04:01.829]  I'm going to go bam, bam, bam very quickly when we come back.
[03:04:01.829 --> 03:04:06.829]  And I'm going to go right to Kate Daly, who always has amazing guests and knocks it out
[03:04:06.829 --> 03:04:07.829]  of the park.
[03:04:08.829 --> 03:04:14.829]  Owen Schroyer with The War Room takes over Central Standard Time.
[03:04:14.829 --> 03:04:19.829]  I kind of went off for the last two hours on Sound of Freedom because, I mean, it takes
[03:04:19.829 --> 03:04:21.829]  a lot for me to get blown away by it.
[03:04:21.829 --> 03:04:27.829]  But the corporate press attacking analogists are basically saying child sex slavery is
[03:04:27.829 --> 03:04:28.829]  not an issue.
[03:04:28.829 --> 03:04:30.829]  It's just they're nuts.
[03:04:30.829 --> 03:04:33.829]  Because even they would admit it was real a few years ago.
[03:04:33.829 --> 03:04:36.829]  But now it's hurting them so bad.
[03:04:36.829 --> 03:04:38.829]  It's one thing to bust a few low-level people.
[03:04:38.829 --> 03:04:42.829]  But now that it's about to bring down the whole house of cards, it's got the globalists
[03:04:42.829 --> 03:04:47.829]  right at the very top kingpins coming out of the woodwork to try to prop up their house
[03:04:47.829 --> 03:04:48.829]  of cards.
[03:04:48.829 --> 03:04:50.829]  So very positive news.
[03:04:50.829 --> 03:04:52.829]  We're winning, folks, with God's help.
[03:04:52.829 --> 03:04:53.829]  We'll be right back.
[03:04:53.829 --> 03:04:54.829]  Stay with us in 60 seconds.
[03:04:56.829 --> 03:04:57.829]  You wanted to plug RainForce.
[03:04:57.829 --> 03:04:58.829]  Do you like RainForce?
[03:04:58.829 --> 03:04:59.829]  Yeah.
[03:04:59.829 --> 03:05:01.829]  So my name is Ken Heckin-Ladley.
[03:05:01.829 --> 03:05:03.829]  How do I write all the books that I do?
[03:05:03.829 --> 03:05:05.829]  Four books with Dr. Judy Majkowicz.
[03:05:05.829 --> 03:05:07.829]  Four books with Project Veritas Whistleblowers.
[03:05:07.829 --> 03:05:09.829]  And now two books with Alex Jones.
[03:05:09.829 --> 03:05:13.829]  That's because I use RainForce every day.
[03:05:13.829 --> 03:05:17.829]  What I always need is I always need some sort of boost in the morning.
[03:05:17.829 --> 03:05:21.829]  And so I try to exercise, eat well, take good vitamins.
[03:05:21.829 --> 03:05:26.829]  But the one thing that I have really found that makes a difference is RainForce.
[03:05:26.829 --> 03:05:30.829]  I'll take RainForce in the morning right before I go to my computer.
[03:05:30.829 --> 03:05:34.829]  And I'm good for the next four or five hours writing a whole lot of stuff.
[03:05:34.829 --> 03:05:38.829]  So it really is true that RainForce is something I use every day.
[03:05:38.829 --> 03:05:40.829]  And it helps me with my writing.
[03:05:40.829 --> 03:05:41.829]  All right.
[03:05:41.829 --> 03:05:42.829]  We love you.
[03:05:42.829 --> 03:05:43.829]  We'll be right back.

[03:05:47.829 --> 03:05:48.829]  We'll be right back with hour number two.
[03:06:00.829 --> 03:06:15.829]  Welcome to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:15.829 --> 03:06:18.829]  I'm Kate Dally from katedallyradio.com and The Kate Dally Show.
[03:06:18.829 --> 03:06:20.829]  So good to be with you today.
[03:06:20.829 --> 03:06:22.829]  I have a special guest for you.
[03:06:22.829 --> 03:06:24.829]  Scott Shara is with me.
[03:06:24.829 --> 03:06:28.829]  And his story is one that you need to hear about.
[03:06:28.829 --> 03:06:31.829]  His story has been felt by millions of people across the country.
[03:06:31.829 --> 03:06:35.829]  So many, including myself, were impacted by having a loved one in the hospital
[03:06:35.829 --> 03:06:41.829]  for the deadly protocol that all the hospitals consented to use across America.
[03:06:41.829 --> 03:06:46.829]  He tragically lost his sweet daughter, Grace, at the hands of the hospital protocol.
[03:06:46.829 --> 03:06:50.829]  And I think it's really important that we bring to light the legal battle that's going on.
[03:06:50.829 --> 03:06:53.829]  Many families are facing legal battles right now.
[03:06:53.829 --> 03:06:59.829]  This case has millions of people interested in its outcome
[03:06:59.829 --> 03:07:02.829]  and really praying for the Shara family,
[03:07:02.829 --> 03:07:11.829]  that the hospital finally has to address what they did to his sweet daughter, Grace.
[03:07:11.829 --> 03:07:17.829]  Scott's with me, and I am so glad to have you on, Scott.
[03:07:17.829 --> 03:07:19.829]  So happy to have you here with me.
[03:07:19.829 --> 03:07:22.829]  I really appreciate you joining me.
[03:07:22.829 --> 03:07:24.829]  Scott, are you with me?
[03:07:24.829 --> 03:07:25.829]  Yeah, I'm with you.
[03:07:25.829 --> 03:07:26.829]  Hi, Scott.
[03:07:26.829 --> 03:07:27.829]  Thanks for having me, Kate.
[03:07:27.829 --> 03:07:28.829]  What a very nice introduction.
[03:07:28.829 --> 03:07:30.829]  I appreciate it.
[03:07:30.829 --> 03:07:31.829]  You bet.
[03:07:31.829 --> 03:07:34.829]  Can you start with your story about what happened?
[03:07:34.829 --> 03:07:37.829]  Because you have something very landmark going on tomorrow
[03:07:37.829 --> 03:07:39.829]  that I want people to be very aware of,
[03:07:39.829 --> 03:07:44.829]  and we need to follow these cases out and not forget about the trauma
[03:07:44.829 --> 03:07:46.829]  that we suffered as a nation by the hands of the hospitals.
[03:07:46.829 --> 03:07:48.829]  Tell us your story.
[03:07:49.829 --> 03:07:55.829]  So, you know, our story starts all the way back to September 22nd of 2002.
[03:07:55.829 --> 03:07:58.829]  That's when God blessed us with the little stinker named Grace.
[03:07:58.829 --> 03:08:00.829]  And, you know, she blessed our life.
[03:08:00.829 --> 03:08:02.829]  We had her for 19 years.
[03:08:02.829 --> 03:08:06.829]  And who gets to have an angel in their life for 19 years?
[03:08:06.829 --> 03:08:08.829]  I don't understand why God picked us.
[03:08:08.829 --> 03:08:11.829]  We certainly didn't deserve it, but we had an angel named Grace.
[03:08:11.829 --> 03:08:13.829]  And Grace had Down syndrome.
[03:08:13.829 --> 03:08:15.829]  She was super high-functioning.
[03:08:15.829 --> 03:08:18.829]  By the way, Kate, I have a shirt somewhat in honor of Grace
[03:08:18.829 --> 03:08:21.829]  in that it was part of the agenda.
[03:08:21.829 --> 03:08:26.829]  So I normally wear a collared shirt, but today I have unvaccinated life sweater.
[03:08:26.829 --> 03:08:28.829]  Oh, I love that.
[03:08:28.829 --> 03:08:34.829]  I wore that because that was in the first doctor's report,
[03:08:34.829 --> 03:08:39.829]  the first day that Grace was in the hospital, which was October 6th of 2021.
[03:08:39.829 --> 03:08:44.829]  We took her to the hospital because she had low oxygen saturation.
[03:08:44.829 --> 03:08:46.829]  Seven days later, she was dead.
[03:08:46.829 --> 03:08:52.829]  And in the first day's doctor report, this is written by what they call the COVID expert.
[03:08:52.829 --> 03:08:54.829]  The guy was so aloof.
[03:08:54.829 --> 03:08:56.829]  I've never met a doctor more rude.
[03:08:56.829 --> 03:09:00.829]  But the reason I wore this shirt today is because he wrote as his last comment
[03:09:00.829 --> 03:09:02.829]  in his first day report,
[03:09:02.829 --> 03:09:08.829]  unfortunately I think the patient probably would not be here if she has been fully vaccinated.
[03:09:08.829 --> 03:09:11.829]  So that bias was obvious,
[03:09:11.829 --> 03:09:17.829]  but the other bias that was even more consistent than the unvaccinated status of Grace
[03:09:17.829 --> 03:09:19.829]  was the fact that she had Down syndrome.
[03:09:19.829 --> 03:09:24.829]  In the 22 doctors' reports that were written in the seven days Grace was in the hospital,
[03:09:24.829 --> 03:09:28.829]  they referenced that she had Down syndrome 36 different times.
[03:09:28.829 --> 03:09:31.829]  That's not relevant to the standard of care.
[03:09:31.829 --> 03:09:34.829]  And as you progress with Grace's stay,
[03:09:34.829 --> 03:09:40.829]  I'll give you the short version for the audience who hasn't heard of Grace's tragic death.
[03:09:40.829 --> 03:09:43.829]  Her last day on this earth was October 13th.
[03:09:43.829 --> 03:09:48.829]  Four days earlier on October 9th, four and a half days earlier on October 9th,
[03:09:48.829 --> 03:09:51.829]  they started Grace on a sedation med called Presidex.
[03:09:51.829 --> 03:09:56.829]  Of course, we find this all out because now we've gone through the records with a fine-tooth comb.
[03:09:56.829 --> 03:09:59.829]  That sedation drug should have never been started.
[03:09:59.829 --> 03:10:05.829]  It was done to set up a ventilator, which was never necessary, and we rejected every time.
[03:10:05.829 --> 03:10:07.829]  Grace was never on a ventilator.
[03:10:07.829 --> 03:10:12.829]  They set up her death with that sedation med.
[03:10:12.829 --> 03:10:15.829]  That med is not supposed to be used for more than 24 hours.
[03:10:15.829 --> 03:10:20.829]  It ended up being used and then put on a maximum allowable dose.
[03:10:20.829 --> 03:10:26.829]  While we were on a phone call with the doctor the morning of Grace's last day,
[03:10:26.829 --> 03:10:28.829]  my wife and I are on a phone call at home.
[03:10:28.829 --> 03:10:30.829]  My daughter Jessica was in the room.
[03:10:30.829 --> 03:10:35.829]  The reason I was at home is I was taken out by an armed guard on October 10th.
[03:10:35.829 --> 03:10:40.829]  So we receive a call, and the purpose of the call was to ask us for a preauthorization
[03:10:40.829 --> 03:10:44.829]  for the fifth time to put Grace on a ventilator just in case.
[03:10:44.829 --> 03:10:47.829]  Well, as I found out by looking at the money trail,
[03:10:47.829 --> 03:10:51.829]  just in case meant because they wanted a $300,000 payday,
[03:10:51.829 --> 03:10:55.829]  which is what they receive if you put somebody on a ventilator.
[03:10:55.829 --> 03:10:57.829]  So we said no for the fifth time.
[03:10:57.829 --> 03:11:00.829]  Then he went on immediately and said,
[03:11:00.829 --> 03:11:04.829]  Well, Grace had such a good day yesterday, this is in spite of being sedated,
[03:11:04.829 --> 03:11:06.829]  that we should work on nutrition.
[03:11:06.829 --> 03:11:07.829]  Let's get her out of bed.
[03:11:07.829 --> 03:11:09.829]  Let's get her out of here in the next several days.
[03:11:09.829 --> 03:11:11.829]  So we agreed to a feeding tube.
[03:11:11.829 --> 03:11:14.829]  That phone call started at 10.12 in the morning.
[03:11:14.829 --> 03:11:17.829]  At 10.48, while we were on the phone call,
[03:11:17.829 --> 03:11:21.829]  he increased the Prosodex to the maximum allowable dose.
[03:11:21.829 --> 03:11:23.829]  We ended the call at 10.55.
[03:11:23.829 --> 03:11:27.829]  At 10.56, he put an illegal do not resuscitate order on Grace,
[03:11:27.829 --> 03:11:30.829]  then combined Prosodex with lorazepam and morphine,
[03:11:30.829 --> 03:11:36.829]  which those meds in combination is what they use in a person's last hour of life
[03:11:36.829 --> 03:11:37.829]  in hospice care.
[03:11:37.829 --> 03:11:40.829]  So they used to euthanize Grace with those meds.
[03:11:40.829 --> 03:11:42.829]  And when it came time to revive Grace,
[03:11:42.829 --> 03:11:47.829]  when we screamed for the doctors and nurses to save her on a FaceTime call,
[03:11:47.829 --> 03:11:50.829]  they screamed back, She's DNR, do not resuscitate.
[03:11:50.829 --> 03:11:52.829]  We had no idea.
[03:11:52.829 --> 03:11:55.829]  And so, of course, we screamed back, She's not DNR.
[03:11:55.829 --> 03:11:56.829]  But they refused.
[03:11:56.829 --> 03:11:58.829]  They refused to enter the room.
[03:11:58.829 --> 03:12:02.829]  And we watched Grace die at 7.27 on October 13th on a FaceTime call.
[03:12:02.829 --> 03:12:06.829]  You know, of course, all of that has led to the lawsuit,
[03:12:06.829 --> 03:12:09.829]  which we filed on April 11th.
[03:12:09.829 --> 03:12:13.829]  This Friday, the 14th at 10 a.m., is our first hearing on the lawsuit,
[03:12:13.829 --> 03:12:15.829]  which, you know, you can ask some questions.
[03:12:15.829 --> 03:12:18.829]  We can discuss that as much as you want, Kate.
[03:12:18.829 --> 03:12:20.829]  I just feel for your family.
[03:12:20.829 --> 03:12:22.829]  So many families went through this.
[03:12:22.829 --> 03:12:26.829]  I was receiving hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of letters
[03:12:26.829 --> 03:12:30.829]  of people that their loved one was in the hospital.
[03:12:30.829 --> 03:12:31.829]  They were trying to get them out.
[03:12:31.829 --> 03:12:33.829]  They couldn't even get into the hospital.
[03:12:33.829 --> 03:12:36.829]  I was in a state where you could actually still get into the ICU,
[03:12:36.829 --> 03:12:41.829]  but there were so many people out there suffering from the same exact thing.
[03:12:41.829 --> 03:12:44.829]  And these hospitals got this protocol,
[03:12:44.829 --> 03:12:48.829]  and this protocol dictated what was going to happen to them,
[03:12:48.829 --> 03:12:50.829]  and everything was under the guise of COVID.
[03:12:50.829 --> 03:12:52.829]  Everything was named COVID.
[03:12:52.829 --> 03:12:55.829]  And that's really convenient when it has 98 symptoms.
[03:12:55.829 --> 03:13:00.829]  And the reason that I also wanted you on today is this story is heartbreaking
[03:13:00.829 --> 03:13:06.829]  because you lost a very special, special girl, a special daughter,
[03:13:06.829 --> 03:13:08.829]  and to this madness.
[03:13:08.829 --> 03:13:12.829]  And what have we done to stop this from happening again?
[03:13:12.829 --> 03:13:16.829]  These hospitals, if they don't understand what they've done,
[03:13:16.829 --> 03:13:18.829]  if they cannot admit what they've done,
[03:13:18.829 --> 03:13:23.829]  then the next time something happens, then we will get something.
[03:13:23.829 --> 03:13:25.829]  We will get something.
[03:13:25.829 --> 03:13:29.829]  And that protocol will also be spit out at the doctors.
[03:13:29.829 --> 03:13:33.829]  And if the doctors go along and the nurses go along
[03:13:33.829 --> 03:13:35.829]  and they don't question and they don't say anything
[03:13:35.829 --> 03:13:38.829]  and everybody stays mum on the subject
[03:13:38.829 --> 03:13:42.829]  and they administer these deadly cocktails and these deadly ventilators again,
[03:13:42.829 --> 03:13:44.829]  we'll be right back in the same situation.
[03:13:44.829 --> 03:13:47.829]  And that's why I thought it was so important to have you on today
[03:13:47.829 --> 03:13:49.829]  because it's like election fraud.
[03:13:49.829 --> 03:13:51.829]  We are not doing anything about that either.
[03:13:51.829 --> 03:13:54.829]  And everybody expects there to be some sort of change.
[03:13:54.829 --> 03:13:58.829]  There isn't going to be a change unless lawsuits like this,
[03:13:58.829 --> 03:14:03.829]  like Scott's, come out and make the hospitals understand
[03:14:03.829 --> 03:14:07.829]  what just happened and what they did to these poor victims.
[03:14:07.829 --> 03:14:11.829]  You really said a mouthful there.
[03:14:12.829 --> 03:14:15.829]  And I want to talk about two things with what you just said.
[03:14:15.829 --> 03:14:20.829]  First of all, we're looking at this after all the research I've done.
[03:14:20.829 --> 03:14:22.829]  I see this has nothing to do with COVID.
[03:14:22.829 --> 03:14:25.829]  This euthanasia agenda has been going on for decades,
[03:14:25.829 --> 03:14:28.829]  and I can prove it beyond a shadow of a doubt.
[03:14:28.829 --> 03:14:30.829]  I can prove it with the documents.
[03:14:30.829 --> 03:14:33.829]  But then as it applies to this specific lawsuit,
[03:14:33.829 --> 03:14:37.829]  we took the extraordinary step of not just filing against the Ascension
[03:14:37.829 --> 03:14:40.829]  Hospital system, but we also filed against five doctors
[03:14:40.829 --> 03:14:43.829]  and two nurses who were directly involved with Grace's death.
[03:14:43.829 --> 03:14:48.829]  And we did that because no person, no doctor,
[03:14:48.829 --> 03:14:53.829]  no nurse can use the excuse of following orders, following protocols,
[03:14:53.829 --> 03:14:57.829]  following the NIH, following the hospital mandate,
[03:14:57.829 --> 03:14:59.829]  whatever excuse they want to use.
[03:14:59.829 --> 03:15:01.829]  They can't do that.
[03:15:01.829 --> 03:15:03.829]  They still are responsible for their choices.
[03:15:04.829 --> 03:15:08.829]  I have talked with a number of doctors and nurses who are still in practice,
[03:15:08.829 --> 03:15:14.829]  and the consistent excuse is that if we didn't do this, we would lose our jobs.
[03:15:14.829 --> 03:15:19.829]  And that excuse can never be used again.
[03:15:19.829 --> 03:15:25.829]  And so we want this lawsuit to be on a national basis to show every doctor
[03:15:25.829 --> 03:15:29.829]  and nurse that you are going to be held to account.
[03:15:29.829 --> 03:15:31.829]  And if for some reason our lawsuit gets dismissed,
[03:15:31.829 --> 03:15:35.829]  I still want every doctor and nurse to know you're going to be held to account
[03:15:35.829 --> 03:15:40.829]  in the next lifetime if you can't be held to account in this lifetime.
[03:15:40.829 --> 03:15:43.829]  I still agree with you, Scott.
[03:15:43.829 --> 03:15:44.829]  We're going to come right back.
[03:15:44.829 --> 03:15:46.829]  There's so much to share on this.
[03:15:46.829 --> 03:15:48.829]  People need to know how to safeguard their loved ones too.
[03:15:48.829 --> 03:15:51.829]  We'll be right back more with Scott Shara on the Algae.
[03:15:55.829 --> 03:15:57.829]  In the early 1900s,
[03:15:57.829 --> 03:16:02.829]  certain companies were off-gassing highly toxic fluoride gases into the atmosphere.
[03:16:02.829 --> 03:16:05.829]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[03:16:05.829 --> 03:16:10.829]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers
[03:16:10.829 --> 03:16:16.829]  to convert these gases into fluorosilicic acid, still highly toxic but containable.
[03:16:16.829 --> 03:16:19.829]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison,
[03:16:19.829 --> 03:16:22.829]  and there was no affordable way to dispose of it.
[03:16:22.829 --> 03:16:27.829]  Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders was also the Secretary of the Treasury,
[03:16:27.829 --> 03:16:30.829]  who was responsible for the public health service at the time.
[03:16:30.829 --> 03:16:37.829]  And by 1950, the U.S. government began buying this toxic, untreated industrial waste product

[03:17:31.829 --> 03:17:33.829]  The enemies out in the open were vindicated.
[03:17:33.829 --> 03:17:35.829]  People are listening more than ever.
[03:17:35.829 --> 03:17:40.829]  But in this major recession going into depression, and with supply chain breakdowns, I know it's hard.
[03:17:40.829 --> 03:17:41.829]  I know times are tough.

[03:17:48.829 --> 03:17:49.829]  as keeping us on air.
[03:17:49.829 --> 03:17:52.829]  So however God leads you in your heart to support us, please support us now.

[03:17:55.829 --> 03:17:58.829]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World,
[03:17:58.829 --> 03:18:03.829]  is a historic book that documents the globalists in their own words, planned for our future.
[03:18:03.829 --> 03:18:04.829]  That is the hellish future.
[03:18:04.829 --> 03:18:08.829]  Now you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them,
[03:18:08.829 --> 03:18:11.829]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World
[03:18:11.829 --> 03:18:14.829]  at bookstores, Amazon, or Infowarsware.com.
[03:18:15.829 --> 03:18:18.829]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book
[03:18:18.829 --> 03:18:20.829]  after the signed copies we got run out.
[03:18:20.829 --> 03:18:23.829]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[03:18:23.829 --> 03:18:26.829]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World,
[03:18:26.829 --> 03:18:28.829]  a signed copy, at Infowarsware.com.
[03:18:28.829 --> 03:18:32.829]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[03:18:32.829 --> 03:18:35.829]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book,
[03:18:35.829 --> 03:18:38.829]  you'll also know that you help keep Infowars on the air.
[03:18:38.829 --> 03:18:41.829]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book,
[03:18:41.829 --> 03:18:42.829]  or unsigned copies.
[03:18:42.829 --> 03:18:46.829]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to Infowarsware.com
[03:18:46.829 --> 03:18:49.829]  and get a signed copy, and buy a couple of unsigned copies,
[03:18:49.829 --> 03:18:52.829]  and donate them to the library, or give them to the local school.
[03:18:52.829 --> 03:18:55.829]  This is an Infowar, I'm counting on you, and thank you for your support.
[03:18:55.829 --> 03:19:00.829]  How many times have you ever spoken to your son about his overseas business dealings?
[03:19:00.829 --> 03:19:03.829]  I've never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.
[03:19:03.829 --> 03:19:04.829]  So let me get this straight.
[03:19:04.829 --> 03:19:07.829]  The FBI was withholding from congressional oversight a document
[03:19:07.829 --> 03:19:09.829]  showing that during the Obama administration,
[03:19:09.829 --> 03:19:12.829]  Biden accepted a $10 million bribe through his son Hunter
[03:19:12.829 --> 03:19:16.829]  to force the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor that was investigating corruption,
[03:19:16.829 --> 03:19:18.829]  an event that Donald Trump looked into,
[03:19:18.829 --> 03:19:21.829]  sparking the first impeachment and forcing the arming of Ukraine,
[03:19:21.829 --> 03:19:24.829]  in turn setting the stage for the current war against Russia.
[03:19:24.829 --> 03:19:26.829]  Evidence of the bribe was also in Hunter Biden's laptop,
[03:19:26.829 --> 03:19:31.829]  which the FBI also had, but that they swore was Russian disinformation
[03:19:31.829 --> 03:19:34.829]  and infiltrated social media to censor during the 2020 campaign,
[03:19:34.829 --> 03:19:38.829]  all while the FBI investigates Trump for having classified documents
[03:19:38.829 --> 03:19:42.829]  despite the FBI admittedly letting Hillary Clinton off for a similar charge in 2016
[03:19:42.829 --> 03:19:46.829]  when they were simultaneously launching the Russiagate investigation into Donald Trump
[03:19:46.829 --> 03:19:50.829]  using falsified evidence provided by the Clinton campaign.
[03:19:50.829 --> 03:19:52.829]  Do I have that all straight?
[03:19:57.829 --> 03:20:01.829]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[03:20:01.829 --> 03:20:03.829]  it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:05.500 --> 03:20:24.220]  My guest is Scott Shara.
[03:20:24.220 --> 03:20:29.100]  He lost his daughter to the hospital protocol.
[03:20:29.100 --> 03:20:34.340]  I would have to say it murdered his daughter and his daughter's sweet daughter, Grace.
[03:20:34.340 --> 03:20:42.940]  In fact, their website to find out more information on this is ouramazinggrace.net, ouramazinggrace.net.
[03:20:42.940 --> 03:20:52.380]  Scott, I think people really need to understand this case because you were not permitted to
[03:20:52.380 --> 03:20:55.740]  even be in the hospital with your daughter.
[03:20:55.740 --> 03:21:02.380]  And I can't imagine hospital staff that would somehow some way be okay with that.
[03:21:02.380 --> 03:21:08.700]  But I know from even my personal story, the hospital didn't want me in there either and
[03:21:08.700 --> 03:21:13.700]  tried their very best to make sure that I wasn't there, but I was.
[03:21:13.700 --> 03:21:16.580]  And you weren't permitted to be in the hospital.
[03:21:16.580 --> 03:21:18.140]  I can't even imagine.
[03:21:18.140 --> 03:21:20.520]  Is this part of this suit too?
[03:21:20.520 --> 03:21:28.180]  Because I can't imagine that they were allowed to keep you away as her parents.
[03:21:28.180 --> 03:21:30.460]  It's probably the most important piece of the suit.
[03:21:30.460 --> 03:21:38.020]  So what the hearing is about on Friday is one of the defendant's attorneys wrote a motion
[03:21:38.020 --> 03:21:39.780]  to partially dismiss.
[03:21:39.780 --> 03:21:43.140]  And what that motion is about is two things.
[03:21:43.140 --> 03:21:47.180]  Number one is to wrap the most important piece of the case, which is the lack of informed
[03:21:47.180 --> 03:21:48.180]  consent.
[03:21:48.180 --> 03:21:53.780]  And that's where the issue of me being removed from the hospital fits with that battery claim,
[03:21:53.780 --> 03:21:55.900]  the lack of informed consent claim.
[03:21:55.900 --> 03:22:03.100]  They want to wrap that into a medical malpractice claim because there are state statutory limits
[03:22:03.100 --> 03:22:07.140]  when it's a medical malpractice claim, which is very frustrating.
[03:22:07.140 --> 03:22:09.300]  We can talk about that in a second.
[03:22:09.300 --> 03:22:13.060]  And then the other thing they're trying to do with the motion to partially dismiss on
[03:22:13.060 --> 03:22:19.540]  Friday is dismiss our declaratory judgment request for the illegal do not resuscitate
[03:22:19.540 --> 03:22:23.980]  order, which is critical.
[03:22:23.980 --> 03:22:29.660]  In Wisconsin, I would say this is more than just Wisconsin because I've heard of hundreds
[03:22:29.660 --> 03:22:33.180]  of illegal DNRs across the country.
[03:22:33.180 --> 03:22:37.460]  But in Wisconsin, the Department of Safety and Professional Services, which is the regulatory
[03:22:37.460 --> 03:22:43.900]  agency that regulates the licenses of doctors and nurses, has gone on record and said that
[03:22:43.900 --> 03:22:53.740]  the state DNR statute does not apply to doctors in a hospital non-emergency room setting.
[03:22:53.740 --> 03:22:55.620]  So wrap your head around that.
[03:22:55.620 --> 03:23:01.580]  That means that a doctor could put an illegal DNR on anybody he wants without their permission.
[03:23:01.580 --> 03:23:07.220]  So we can't, you know, this motion to partially dismiss is so critical that we went on Friday
[03:23:07.220 --> 03:23:13.100]  because the informed consent, the lack of informed consent applies to across the board
[03:23:13.100 --> 03:23:17.900]  with all the COVID cases and way before COVID.
[03:23:17.900 --> 03:23:20.220]  But everybody had lack of informed consent.
[03:23:20.220 --> 03:23:24.460]  The doctors just went in and did everything that they wanted to.
[03:23:24.460 --> 03:23:29.340]  If you weren't there in your situation, your husband wouldn't be alive.
[03:23:29.340 --> 03:23:34.700]  So in Grace's situation, if I would have had informed consent, Grace would be alive today
[03:23:34.700 --> 03:23:38.100]  in spite of what they did because I would have been able to stop it.
[03:23:38.100 --> 03:23:42.060]  I would not have approved, obviously, the things that were happening.
[03:23:42.060 --> 03:23:50.020]  So the informed consent piece is where the specific idea of they remove me, it fits under
[03:23:50.020 --> 03:23:53.460]  that specific claim.
[03:23:53.460 --> 03:23:56.620]  I'm so glad, I mean, that you can spell that out.
[03:23:56.620 --> 03:24:02.540]  And I really do hope that that can't be taken from you guys because that is, that is the
[03:24:02.540 --> 03:24:03.540]  biggest piece.
[03:24:03.540 --> 03:24:07.620]  I mean, we need to be there for our loved ones and to say something is so dire.
[03:24:07.620 --> 03:24:13.980]  What I always found was interesting was they wanted to keep me out for, you know, I could
[03:24:13.980 --> 03:24:14.980]  give somebody COVID.
[03:24:14.980 --> 03:24:18.860]  Well, the person that you just brought in, if that's the case and they are sick, how would
[03:24:18.860 --> 03:24:19.860]  you make them more sick?
[03:24:19.860 --> 03:24:24.140]  You know, it's a ridiculous notion and it's illogical.
[03:24:24.140 --> 03:24:27.980]  And the fact that they got away with it, are they, are they getting away with it?
[03:24:27.980 --> 03:24:32.940]  Is it included when you walk in and you sign their little electronic pad?
[03:24:32.940 --> 03:24:36.580]  I mean, do we realize we're signing our lives away?
[03:24:36.580 --> 03:24:40.140]  I don't think we realize what we're doing when we're signing off, when we bring somebody
[03:24:40.140 --> 03:24:41.140]  to the hospital.
[03:24:41.140 --> 03:24:44.300]  Boy, is that a great point?
[03:24:44.300 --> 03:24:50.140]  There's so many points where they have, like I, the way I like to explain it is the liberals
[03:24:50.140 --> 03:24:54.940]  have control of the ground game and the ground game are those type of situations.
[03:24:54.940 --> 03:25:00.160]  So you walk into a hospital, they want you to sign this stupid little pad with the fake
[03:25:00.160 --> 03:25:01.580]  pen.
[03:25:01.580 --> 03:25:06.020]  That is one of the many recommendations I have for people now, now that I'm woken up
[03:25:06.020 --> 03:25:10.260]  to this is never sign anything without completely reading it.
[03:25:10.260 --> 03:25:15.500]  And in the case of entering the hospital, what you want to do specifically is ask for
[03:25:15.500 --> 03:25:20.820]  the printout, read it, cross off anything where you are giving rights away, initial
[03:25:20.820 --> 03:25:23.180]  it and get a copy.
[03:25:23.180 --> 03:25:24.180]  It's critical.
[03:25:24.180 --> 03:25:26.340]  They're not claiming that at this point.
[03:25:26.340 --> 03:25:31.940]  In our case, it'll be interesting to see how that specific situation shakes out.
[03:25:31.940 --> 03:25:37.420]  Regardless of what rights you sign away, they don't have the authority to kill you.
[03:25:37.420 --> 03:25:43.020]  What's interesting about, you know, when I look at the legal wrangling with these type
[03:25:43.020 --> 03:25:45.300]  of situations, it's very frustrating.
[03:25:45.300 --> 03:25:47.820]  So we filed our case on April 11th.
[03:25:47.820 --> 03:25:53.580]  On May 15th, Ascension Hospital System, the five doctors, two nurses all had to legally
[03:25:53.580 --> 03:25:54.580]  respond.
[03:25:54.580 --> 03:25:55.580]  They all did.
[03:25:55.580 --> 03:26:00.820]  A few points out of Ascension Hospital System's response are interesting.
[03:26:00.820 --> 03:26:02.220]  So I'm going to just quote these.
[03:26:02.220 --> 03:26:05.040]  So when we file, it's called a summons and complaint.
[03:26:05.040 --> 03:26:07.400]  When they respond, it's called an answer.
[03:26:07.400 --> 03:26:11.760]  So they wrote, quote, in answer to paragraph six of the complaint, deny that Ascension
[03:26:11.760 --> 03:26:15.200]  Hospital System directly provides health care services.
[03:26:15.200 --> 03:26:17.480]  So, you know, think through what they're saying.
[03:26:17.480 --> 03:26:19.400]  So they use the word directly.
[03:26:19.400 --> 03:26:24.840]  So they cannot be held liable because they don't directly provide health care services.
[03:26:24.840 --> 03:26:27.320]  That's obviously ridiculous.
[03:26:27.320 --> 03:26:29.200]  This is a real interesting one to me.
[03:26:29.200 --> 03:26:33.560]  In answer to paragraph 40 of the complaint, deny that Scott Sherrill was removed from the
[03:26:33.560 --> 03:26:34.560]  hospital.
[03:26:34.720 --> 03:26:37.720]  Well, what was I doing then?
[03:26:37.720 --> 03:26:40.760]  This stuff, you can't make it up.
[03:26:40.760 --> 03:26:46.700]  Then they also have an opportunity to do what's called affirmative defenses.
[03:26:46.700 --> 03:26:49.280]  So they wrote affirmative defense six.
[03:26:49.280 --> 03:26:53.920]  Any and all injuries or damages sustained by plaintiffs may be a direct and proximate
[03:26:53.920 --> 03:26:57.760]  result of the negligence and or decisions made by the plaintiffs.
[03:26:57.760 --> 03:26:59.400]  So where are they going with that one?
[03:26:59.400 --> 03:27:05.560]  I presume they're going to say, well, because Grace wasn't vaccinated, that's why I wore
[03:27:05.560 --> 03:27:06.560]  the shirt.
[03:27:06.560 --> 03:27:10.880]  But, you know, so then you ask, well, did they agree to anything?
[03:27:10.880 --> 03:27:14.160]  So the shocker, you know, you're sitting down, thankfully, Kate.
[03:27:14.160 --> 03:27:17.960]  OK, so they did agree to two things.
[03:27:17.960 --> 03:27:20.160]  In the someone's in complaint, they agreed to two things.
[03:27:20.160 --> 03:27:25.000]  One is that Grace was admitted to the hospital and, quote, in answer to paragraph 74 of the
[03:27:25.000 --> 03:27:28.760]  complaint, admit that Grace Sherrill passed away.
[03:27:28.760 --> 03:27:30.920]  This stuff is it's so crazy.
[03:27:30.920 --> 03:27:35.440]  And there's another piece I would like to share if I have time right now relative to
[03:27:35.440 --> 03:27:36.920]  the motion to dismiss.
[03:27:36.920 --> 03:27:37.920]  Is that OK, Kate?
[03:27:37.920 --> 03:27:38.920]  Sure.
[03:27:38.920 --> 03:27:39.920]  You got about a minute.
[03:27:39.920 --> 03:27:40.920]  Go for it.
[03:27:40.920 --> 03:27:41.920]  Yes.
[03:27:41.920 --> 03:27:46.840]  So in the motion to dismiss, the attorney wrote the legislature's purpose in enacting
[03:27:46.840 --> 03:27:52.600]  a statutory scheme to govern claims for damages arising out of the alleged medical negligence
[03:27:52.640 --> 03:27:59.160]  was to encourage health care providers to remain in Wisconsin by imposing certain limits
[03:27:59.160 --> 03:28:03.840]  on the causes of action that a patient or her family member can pursue and the types
[03:28:03.840 --> 03:28:06.360]  and amount of damages that can be recovered.
[03:28:06.360 --> 03:28:10.040]  So that's where they're trying to take the informed consent and wrap it into medical
[03:28:10.040 --> 03:28:11.040]  malpractice.
[03:28:11.040 --> 03:28:12.040]  Why?
[03:28:12.040 --> 03:28:16.640]  Because there's statutory limits for claims for doctors in medical malpractice.
[03:28:16.640 --> 03:28:18.120]  This is across the country.
[03:28:18.120 --> 03:28:24.500]  Why do doctors need to have limitations on medical malpractice?
[03:28:24.500 --> 03:28:27.960]  They're not bashful about why they're saying, because otherwise the doctors won't practice
[03:28:27.960 --> 03:28:28.960]  in the state.
[03:28:28.960 --> 03:28:31.480]  Why don't you just be a good doctor?
[03:28:31.480 --> 03:28:34.680]  Then you don't need to have liability limitations.
[03:28:34.680 --> 03:28:35.680]  I own a business.
[03:28:35.680 --> 03:28:37.840]  I don't get liability limitations.
[03:28:37.840 --> 03:28:41.080]  If I do something wrong, I've got to make it right.
[03:28:41.080 --> 03:28:44.200]  So why do doctors get free pass?
[03:28:44.200 --> 03:28:45.200]  They don't.
[03:28:45.200 --> 03:28:46.200]  And they shouldn't.
[03:28:46.200 --> 03:28:47.960]  So we're going to try to make, make that stop.
[03:28:47.960 --> 03:28:52.440]  Be right back on the Alex Jones show more with Scott Sherriff when I return, you'll
[03:28:52.440 --> 03:28:56.760]  want to hear this.
[03:28:56.760 --> 03:29:01.320]  Infowarsstore.com is like a grocery store or like a vitamin shop.
[03:29:01.320 --> 03:29:03.320]  We want to have all the best brands for you.
[03:29:03.320 --> 03:29:05.120]  We want to have a bunch of different choices for you.
[03:29:05.120 --> 03:29:07.800]  So I get constant questions online in person.
[03:29:07.800 --> 03:29:08.800]  Hey, what's better?
[03:29:08.800 --> 03:29:09.800]  Knockout.
[03:29:09.800 --> 03:29:10.800]  What's better?
[03:29:10.800 --> 03:29:11.800]  Down and out.
[03:29:11.800 --> 03:29:12.800]  What's better?
[03:29:12.800 --> 03:29:13.800]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[03:29:14.400 --> 03:29:17.200]  And the answer is different herbal formulas.
[03:29:17.200 --> 03:29:20.000]  Different compounds are better for different people.
[03:29:20.000 --> 03:29:24.120]  So one person might like this coffee and other person likes that coffee.
[03:29:24.120 --> 03:29:25.280]  That's how our bodies work.
[03:29:25.280 --> 03:29:26.280]  They're all very diverse.
[03:29:26.280 --> 03:29:30.880]  But we've been able to private label a national bestseller that's been sold for many years

[03:30:57.200 --> 03:31:02.480]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil, which is at the foundation of our entire food
[03:31:02.480 --> 03:31:04.000]  supply.
[03:31:04.000 --> 03:31:08.600]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element, which
[03:31:08.600 --> 03:31:14.000]  has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population and there are two things we
[03:31:14.000 --> 03:31:15.620]  need to do about it.
[03:31:15.620 --> 03:31:18.960]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[03:31:18.960 --> 03:31:24.160]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics that will naturally
[03:31:24.160 --> 03:31:30.100]  keep the soil rich with iodine and we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount
[03:31:30.100 --> 03:31:36.460]  of iodine every day derived from ancient sea salts found thousands of feet below the
[03:31:36.460 --> 03:31:37.860]  earth's surface.
[03:31:37.860 --> 03:31:43.980]  Our Infowars Life Survival Shield X3 is hands down the best.
[03:31:43.980 --> 03:31:49.820]  Pure nascent iodine stabilized in an activated triiodine form.

[03:31:56.500 --> 03:31:58.140]  The globalists are only humans.
[03:31:58.180 --> 03:32:01.900]  Yeah, they have control of the central banks, they have a lot of power, but they can be
[03:32:01.900 --> 03:32:02.900]  defeated.
[03:32:02.900 --> 03:32:05.980]  But some of their operations are going to take decades to stop.
[03:32:05.980 --> 03:32:10.100]  But one thing you can do right now is take control of your body and your family's body
[03:32:10.100 --> 03:32:14.900]  by purifying the water that you drink and that you cook with and you do it with the
[03:32:14.900 --> 03:32:17.780]  highest quality gravity fed filter out there.
[03:32:17.780 --> 03:32:21.860]  This thing does 10,000 gallons and you can sit there and put hundreds of gallons through
[03:32:21.860 --> 03:32:22.860]  in a day.
[03:32:22.860 --> 03:32:26.900]  It purifies very quickly and it cuts out thousands of chemicals to non-detectable levels.
[03:32:26.900 --> 03:32:29.260]  This is what I use, what my family uses.
[03:32:29.260 --> 03:32:33.180]  It's the very best system out there for the lowest price for a limited time, 10% off on

[03:32:45.140 --> 03:32:46.140]  Don't procrastinate.
[03:32:46.140 --> 03:32:49.940]  This is one of the main areas we can take control of our lives and stop the globalists from
[03:32:49.940 --> 03:32:52.500]  hitting us with poison that they allow in the water supply.
[03:32:52.500 --> 03:32:55.140]  In some cases, they add the water supply like fluoride.
[03:32:56.900 --> 03:33:04.100]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:05.600 --> 03:33:30.560]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:30.560 --> 03:33:36.200]  I'm here with Scott Shara and let me tell you his story.
[03:33:36.200 --> 03:33:42.280]  His story breaks my heart because he lost grace in this, but I love his fight because
[03:33:42.280 --> 03:33:49.600]  his fight means that we could maybe change and impact this horrific system of the hospitals
[03:33:49.600 --> 03:33:57.240]  taking the NIH orders on what to do and telling the doctors exactly what they're going to
[03:33:57.240 --> 03:33:58.240]  do.
[03:33:58.240 --> 03:34:01.160]  On the other hand, you have doctors that don't ask any questions.
[03:34:01.160 --> 03:34:06.440]  I found doctors that were not curious at all, didn't care what the protocol was, didn't
[03:34:06.440 --> 03:34:08.640]  care to research it, could have cared less.
[03:34:08.640 --> 03:34:13.280]  They just wanted to do what the NIH told them to do through their hospital administrations
[03:34:13.280 --> 03:34:15.400]  and that's kind of how it was divvied out.
[03:34:15.400 --> 03:34:21.780]  But FEMA came in with our tax dollars and with printed press money and decided to try
[03:34:21.780 --> 03:34:27.320]  to give people who lost a loved one $9,000 for funeral expenses.
[03:34:27.320 --> 03:34:30.600]  Do you want to comment on this, Scott?
[03:34:30.600 --> 03:34:35.240]  That's quite an interesting fact and you're spot on.
[03:34:35.240 --> 03:34:43.920]  This is called the Hegelian dialectic, when the person who causes the problem then sets
[03:34:43.920 --> 03:34:47.560]  up the reaction and then also provides the solution.
[03:34:47.560 --> 03:34:50.160]  So the same person who caused it provides the solution.
[03:34:50.160 --> 03:34:55.760]  In this case, the government caused the problem, COVID's a complete psyop, and then they already
[03:34:55.920 --> 03:34:57.520]  have a pre-planned solution.
[03:34:57.520 --> 03:35:01.760]  The reaction, of course, is death and the pre-planned solution is, hey, we're going
[03:35:01.760 --> 03:35:07.840]  to ride in on a white horse and give you $9,000 to help bury your loved one.
[03:35:07.840 --> 03:35:13.680]  People unsuspectingly take the money, not realizing the government caused the problem.
[03:35:13.680 --> 03:35:19.040]  When we became aware of that after Grace's death, my wife was fantastic on it.
[03:35:19.040 --> 03:35:21.360]  She just said, Scott, we're not taking their dirty money.
[03:35:21.480 --> 03:35:27.280]  We never took the money and I'm glad we didn't because we would be giving tacit approval
[03:35:27.280 --> 03:35:29.280]  to what they did to Grace.
[03:35:29.280 --> 03:35:31.720]  Scott, this is why I love you.
[03:35:31.720 --> 03:35:33.560]  Seriously, you're a warrior.
[03:35:33.560 --> 03:35:38.640]  A lot of people took that money, needed that money, and you resisted.
[03:35:38.640 --> 03:35:41.560]  That's the reason you're able to do this today too.
[03:35:41.560 --> 03:35:48.800]  There was a FEMA, I'm not FEMA, but the PREP Act.
[03:35:48.800 --> 03:35:51.360]  The PREP Act went through in 2005.
[03:35:51.360 --> 03:35:55.680]  I don't know why in the world, well, I do know why, I could probably answer my own question.
[03:35:55.680 --> 03:36:02.920]  Under the HHS notification, the PREP Act was modified early on during this whole, I call
[03:36:02.920 --> 03:36:06.520]  it blow vid because it's such a joke, blow vid narrative.
[03:36:06.520 --> 03:36:11.200]  It was that the amended section added that the PREP Act liability protections extend
[03:36:11.200 --> 03:36:16.440]  to covered persons for recommended activities that are related to any covered countermeasure
[03:36:16.440 --> 03:36:20.200]  in regards to SARS-CoV-2.
[03:36:20.200 --> 03:36:23.800]  They told the hospitals that they had to follow this.
[03:36:23.800 --> 03:36:28.280]  They were going to be open to liability, but you know, here's the deal.
[03:36:28.280 --> 03:36:30.480]  Number one, that should have never gone through.
[03:36:30.480 --> 03:36:33.000]  Who allowed that and why?
[03:36:33.000 --> 03:36:37.800]  I could probably answer that too, but number two, doctors take an oath and they take an
[03:36:37.800 --> 03:36:42.440]  oath to help our loved ones in times of need.
[03:36:43.440 --> 03:36:46.960]  What happened in Grace's situation?
[03:36:46.960 --> 03:36:52.560]  In Grace's situation in murder, they decided that money and they decided obviously that
[03:36:52.560 --> 03:36:57.280]  the government dictating this down to their administration was far more important than
[03:36:57.280 --> 03:36:58.280]  saving a life.
[03:36:58.280 --> 03:37:03.960]  And this is when I lost a lot of respect for hospital personnel is because I felt like
[03:37:03.960 --> 03:37:10.360]  they couldn't or would not, I'd say would not distinguish between the two and put the
[03:37:10.360 --> 03:37:11.840]  patient first.
[03:37:11.840 --> 03:37:12.840]  Your thoughts on that?
[03:37:12.840 --> 03:37:16.920]  Boy, do I have a lot of thoughts on that.
[03:37:16.920 --> 03:37:21.720]  The idea a doctor wrote me, a doctor wrote me about a month ago after you heard me on
[03:37:21.720 --> 03:37:26.440]  a podcast and said, Scott, just so you remember, we haven't taken the oath to do no harm for
[03:37:26.440 --> 03:37:28.040]  a long time.
[03:37:28.040 --> 03:37:31.000]  And that's part of what we've been programmed to believe.
[03:37:31.000 --> 03:37:36.000]  And so then when we get into a hospital setting, we assume it's a safe zone because the doctor's
[03:37:36.000 --> 03:37:38.200]  taken this oath to do no harm.
[03:37:38.200 --> 03:37:42.440]  So that lie we need to debunk right here for anybody listening.
[03:37:42.440 --> 03:37:47.080]  And I can prove that I mentioned at the beginning of the show, I can prove many, I think I can
[03:37:47.080 --> 03:37:49.680]  prove everything relative to Grace's murder.
[03:37:49.680 --> 03:37:52.000]  But this has been going on way before COVID.
[03:37:52.000 --> 03:37:56.960]  COVID exposed it to those of us who are paying attention.
[03:37:56.960 --> 03:37:59.040]  But I'm going to give you a document reference.
[03:37:59.040 --> 03:38:01.240]  So everybody's familiar with Obamacare.
[03:38:01.240 --> 03:38:05.400]  Obamacare was written by the chief architect Ezekiel Emanuel.
[03:38:05.400 --> 03:38:06.800]  And this set the stage.
[03:38:06.800 --> 03:38:12.400]  It was set way before this, but this legally set the stage for what happened with the PSYOP
[03:38:12.400 --> 03:38:14.720]  known as COOP, or as COVID.
[03:38:14.720 --> 03:38:16.280]  I like what you said, blow it.
[03:38:16.280 --> 03:38:17.280]  That's fantastic.
[03:38:17.280 --> 03:38:22.600]  So Ezekiel Emanuel in 1996 said, services provided to individuals who are irreversibly
[03:38:22.600 --> 03:38:28.560]  prevented from being or becoming participating citizens are not basic and should not be guaranteed.
[03:38:28.560 --> 03:38:30.680]  So that's the spirit of collectivism.
[03:38:30.680 --> 03:38:31.840]  That's what that man believed.
[03:38:31.840 --> 03:38:34.080]  That's why he was hired to write Obamacare.
[03:38:34.080 --> 03:38:41.560]  If you pull Obamacare from Google, you will see that on page 141, it's a 906-page document.
[03:38:41.560 --> 03:38:44.560]  Page 141 is section 1553.
[03:38:44.560 --> 03:38:48.520]  Section 1553 is the legal license to kill us.
[03:38:48.520 --> 03:38:56.640]  And it says that any government cannot discriminate and may not subject an individual or institutional
[03:38:56.640 --> 03:39:02.640]  healthcare entity to discrimination on the basis that that entity does not provide any
[03:39:02.640 --> 03:39:08.360]  healthcare item or service furnished for the purpose of causing or for the purpose
[03:39:08.360 --> 03:39:14.080]  of assisting in causing the death of any individual such as by assisted suicide, euthanasia, or
[03:39:14.080 --> 03:39:15.080]  mercy killing.
[03:39:15.080 --> 03:39:22.080]  So right there, we have in black and white, the authority to kill people, so Grace specifically,
[03:39:22.080 --> 03:39:23.760]  by euthanizing her.
[03:39:23.760 --> 03:39:32.680]  If you read section 1553 of the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, you will see it's so
[03:39:32.680 --> 03:39:34.640]  egregious, you can't make it up.
[03:39:34.640 --> 03:39:39.320]  If the entire country saw this, we would be able to stop this in a minute.
[03:39:39.320 --> 03:39:41.840]  So then still, so they have a license to kill us.
[03:39:41.840 --> 03:39:44.280]  How do they possibly get people to do it?
[03:39:44.280 --> 03:39:45.760]  How do they get the doctors to do it?
[03:39:45.760 --> 03:39:51.920]  Well, we found a smoking gun in Grace's case that is written by the Palliative Care Network
[03:39:51.920 --> 03:39:52.920]  of Wisconsin.
[03:39:52.920 --> 03:39:56.880]  And it's a training document for doctors to kill patients with Down syndrome.
[03:39:56.880 --> 03:40:02.600]  It was written by two MDs, it was written in July of 2011, the year after Obamacare
[03:40:02.600 --> 03:40:03.720]  was passed.
[03:40:03.720 --> 03:40:08.760]  And it walks through all the problems that people with Down syndrome have to set up a
[03:40:08.760 --> 03:40:09.960]  transition statement.
[03:40:09.960 --> 03:40:16.400]  So they list about 50 problems, cardiac septal defects, thyroid dysfunction, congenital
[03:40:16.400 --> 03:40:19.680]  hip dislocation, etc, etc, etc.
[03:40:19.680 --> 03:40:20.680]  Why?
[03:40:20.920 --> 03:40:23.600]  What the transition statement says at all.
[03:40:23.600 --> 03:40:27.200]  The lifelong toll on families is high, I'm quoting right out of the document.
[03:40:27.200 --> 03:40:31.560]  So if you look at all those problems, and now you're a healthcare worker, you get the
[03:40:31.560 --> 03:40:35.720]  Down syndrome person in your bed to take care of.
[03:40:35.720 --> 03:40:38.920]  And you see, okay, this is how I've been trained.
[03:40:38.920 --> 03:40:40.440]  These people are a problem.
[03:40:40.440 --> 03:40:43.800]  The family doesn't want them because there's so much problem.
[03:40:43.800 --> 03:40:48.160]  And so then it says part of a robust plan of care includes acknowledgement of this toll
[03:40:48.160 --> 03:40:49.680]  by healthcare workers.
[03:40:49.680 --> 03:40:53.120]  So the Down syndrome person is a toll on the family.
[03:40:53.120 --> 03:40:55.840]  I'm telling you bluntly, Grace was not a toll on our family.
[03:40:55.840 --> 03:41:00.160]  So the Down syndrome person, they're convincing the medical professionals that they are a
[03:41:00.160 --> 03:41:01.640]  toll on the family.
[03:41:01.640 --> 03:41:06.160]  And that medical professional needs to be responsible to help that family out.
[03:41:06.160 --> 03:41:07.820]  So then they have the killing statement.
[03:41:07.820 --> 03:41:12.920]  It says specifically, whenever possible, decision makers for people with Down syndrome, that's
[03:41:12.920 --> 03:41:19.480]  the doctors, should be encouraged to use substituted judgment to make key palliative care decisions.
[03:41:19.480 --> 03:41:22.640]  All efforts should be made to determine the preferences of the patient.
[03:41:22.640 --> 03:41:28.920]  However, because of lifelong cognitive impairment, the views of the person with Down syndrome
[03:41:28.920 --> 03:41:30.560]  may not be known.
[03:41:30.560 --> 03:41:31.880]  And that's insane.
[03:41:31.880 --> 03:41:39.320]  But this follows that collectivism that Ezekiel Emanuel was hired to put inside of Obamacare.
[03:41:39.320 --> 03:41:45.600]  So in collectivism, we can't have non-contributing members of society getting the same medical
[03:41:45.600 --> 03:41:48.500]  care as contributing members of society.
[03:41:48.500 --> 03:41:53.820]  So this is a literal smoking gun as to why Grace was murdered.
[03:41:53.820 --> 03:41:58.180]  And I can't tell enough people this, and it has nothing to do with Down syndrome.
[03:41:58.180 --> 03:42:02.180]  This has to do with elderly, anybody who is disabled.
[03:42:02.180 --> 03:42:07.660]  Remember, all of us are going to be non-contributing citizens sometime in our life.
[03:42:07.660 --> 03:42:12.900]  The paper is all about devaluing life.
[03:42:12.900 --> 03:42:15.840]  It's devaluing people's existence.
[03:42:16.200 --> 03:42:20.760]  With a sweep of a pen, I cannot wrap my brain around that.
[03:42:20.760 --> 03:42:22.960]  And we do not look at that documentation.
[03:42:22.960 --> 03:42:26.000]  Obamacare is in full effect.
[03:42:45.840 --> 03:43:03.120]  With all the craziness in the world, the collapsing borders, the war with Russia, the insanity,
[03:43:03.120 --> 03:43:08.080]  the currency devaluations, the economy going crazy, you are crazy, in my view, if you don't
[03:43:08.080 --> 03:43:11.360]  get high-quality, storable food and water filtration and self-defense.
[03:43:11.360 --> 03:43:13.800]  Now, we're not selling guns and ammo.
[03:43:13.800 --> 03:43:16.720]  It's for you to go out and get for yourself and learn how to use if you haven't.
[03:43:16.720 --> 03:43:18.360]  And I'm preaching to the choir on that.
[03:43:18.360 --> 03:43:23.280]  But a lot of people got plenty of guns, but they don't have enough storable food or water filtration.
[03:43:23.280 --> 03:43:27.880]  This is something you need now, and we've got it in the food department and in the high-quality
[03:43:27.880 --> 03:43:29.480]  water filtration department.
[03:43:29.480 --> 03:43:33.760]  The highest quality food, the best water filtration at the lowest prices you're going to find
[03:43:33.760 --> 03:43:35.240]  and still get quality.
[03:43:35.240 --> 03:43:40.960]  Infowarsstore.com is running a special right now for 10% off on all storable food and on
[03:43:40.960 --> 03:43:43.160]  water and air filtration.
[03:43:43.160 --> 03:43:45.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, you cannot beat this deal.
[03:43:45.800 --> 03:43:47.080]  Our prices are already the lowest.
[03:43:47.080 --> 03:43:50.000]  At 10% off, it's an insane deal for a limited time.
[03:43:50.000 --> 03:43:56.480]  Go to infowarsstore.com and get prepared while you still can.
[03:43:56.480 --> 03:44:00.200]  I want to thank all of you over the years who have supported Infowars financially with
[03:44:00.200 --> 03:44:02.160]  word of mouth and prayer.
[03:44:02.160 --> 03:44:05.560]  All the success that we've had together against the globalists and the fact that we're not
[03:44:05.560 --> 03:44:09.760]  caught flat-footed during their major takeover is because of you.
[03:44:09.760 --> 03:44:12.760]  Humanity has a real fighting chance.
[03:44:12.760 --> 03:44:16.520]  I just want to thank you all for buying products at infowarsstore.com, like books and films
[03:44:16.520 --> 03:44:19.880]  and supplements and water filtration, air filtration, and so much more.

[03:44:42.280 --> 03:44:46.880]  that want to support Freedom to take action now and be part of the global awakening, the
[03:44:46.880 --> 03:44:52.120]  new renaissance that's countering the Great Reset, by going to infowarsstore.com and clicking
[03:44:52.120 --> 03:44:54.120]  on the Donate button and giving today.
[03:44:54.120 --> 03:44:55.400]  Thank you so much for your support.
[03:44:55.400 --> 03:44:56.640]  Please take action.
[03:44:56.640 --> 03:45:01.320]  The globalists aren't just targeting us through the poison shots or the electromagnetic 5G
[03:45:01.320 --> 03:45:03.080]  or the GMO crops.
[03:45:03.080 --> 03:45:08.480]  They're hitting us with hundreds of chemicals that the EPA has authorized companies and industry
[03:45:08.480 --> 03:45:09.480]  to use.
[03:45:09.480 --> 03:45:12.800]  One of the top pesticides used is atrazine.
[03:45:12.800 --> 03:45:16.480]  The allowable level the government admits that they allow to be in your water supply
[03:45:16.480 --> 03:45:22.040]  is enough to sterilize you and basically turn your son into a feminized mutant.
[03:45:22.040 --> 03:45:23.040]  Look it up.
[03:45:23.040 --> 03:45:24.420]  Don't let them do this to your family.
[03:45:24.420 --> 03:45:29.680]  We have the very best gravity-fed filter system out there, highest rated at half the price
[03:45:29.680 --> 03:45:33.120]  of leading competitors, the Alexa Pure, ready to ship to you right now.
[03:45:33.120 --> 03:45:35.320]  We have replacement filters for folks who have already gotten it.
[03:45:35.320 --> 03:45:37.320]  It does 10,000 gallons before you replace them.
[03:45:37.320 --> 03:45:38.320]  It is amazing.
[03:45:38.320 --> 03:45:39.760]  It's great for your home, your business.
[03:45:39.760 --> 03:45:43.360]  You can put swamp water in it, tap water, well water.
[03:45:43.360 --> 03:45:44.640]  Almost everything's contaminated.
[03:45:44.640 --> 03:45:48.680]  This is how you take control of the fluids in your body and counter the globalist onslaught.
[03:45:48.680 --> 03:45:50.400]  Get yours today at Infowars.com.
[03:45:50.400 --> 03:45:52.680]  For a limited time, we're running a 10% discount.
[03:45:52.680 --> 03:45:53.680]  That is a huge discount.
[03:45:53.680 --> 03:45:55.040]  It's probably the lowest price out there.
[03:45:55.040 --> 03:45:56.040]  You need this filter.
[03:45:56.040 --> 03:46:00.640]  I talk a lot about the great successes Infowars has had.
[03:46:00.640 --> 03:46:05.760]  I don't think anybody can deny it, and it is because of listeners and viewers supporting
[03:46:05.760 --> 03:46:06.760]  us.
[03:46:07.200 --> 03:46:12.200]  When we talk about the crew at Infowars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[03:46:12.200 --> 03:46:15.080]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[03:46:15.080 --> 03:46:20.080]  When we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day,
[03:46:20.080 --> 03:46:24.720]  five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[03:46:24.720 --> 03:46:27.720]  For myself and the whole Infowars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[03:46:27.720 --> 03:46:33.520]  I only encourage you now to realize that Infowars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[03:46:33.520 --> 03:46:34.920]  I know you spread the word.
[03:46:34.920 --> 03:46:35.920]  I know you pray for us.
[03:46:36.080 --> 03:46:37.080]  That's wonderful.
[03:46:37.080 --> 03:46:38.080]  Keep doing it.
[03:46:38.080 --> 03:46:42.000]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfowarsStore.com, and you never buy great
[03:46:42.000 --> 03:46:45.880]  products that enrich and empower your life while at the same time keeping us on air.
[03:46:45.880 --> 03:46:50.280]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:46:50.280 --> 03:46:54.400]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfowarsStore.com, our funding problems
[03:46:54.400 --> 03:46:55.400]  will be over.
[03:46:55.400 --> 03:46:56.400]  Please take action now.
[03:46:56.400 --> 03:47:04.080]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:05.600 --> 03:47:19.840]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, I'm Kate Dally from katedallyradio.com, the Kate Dally
[03:47:19.840 --> 03:47:20.840]  Show.
[03:47:20.840 --> 03:47:23.600]  There are a couple of things, Scott, that I want to bring up.
[03:47:23.600 --> 03:47:27.200]  Number one, remdesivir was part of this protocol.
[03:47:27.200 --> 03:47:30.520]  They were trying to shove down everybody, and I know people in the hospital that were
[03:47:30.520 --> 03:47:34.000]  the nurses actually tried to sneak it into the IVs.
[03:47:34.000 --> 03:47:38.880]  The actual name of it is Veklurie, and I think they did that on purpose because the actual
[03:47:38.880 --> 03:47:43.960]  name is Veklurie, knowing that remdesivir would be found out after many, many deaths.
[03:47:43.960 --> 03:47:48.840]  Then they could go to Veklurie, which, by the way, is now in all of our hospitals, all
[03:47:48.840 --> 03:47:50.520]  the way down to newborns.
[03:47:50.520 --> 03:47:55.560]  It's that dangerous drug that didn't even pass the Ebola test and had to be withdrawn
[03:47:55.560 --> 03:47:58.920]  because it had way too many deaths attached to it.
[03:47:58.920 --> 03:48:04.680]  And then they used that immediately, even before we even knew blovid was a thing, they
[03:48:04.680 --> 03:48:06.520]  actually made it the protocol.
[03:48:06.520 --> 03:48:07.520]  How did they know?
[03:48:07.520 --> 03:48:14.600]  Geez, because maybe somebody named Fauci was in on the Gilead profiteering on that drug.
[03:48:14.600 --> 03:48:19.920]  But they've got that passed through to your loved ones, even down to newborns.
[03:48:19.920 --> 03:48:24.500]  Be very, very aware of Veklurie because that is that real name that they're going by now
[03:48:24.500 --> 03:48:26.760]  and using it, and that's scary.
[03:48:26.760 --> 03:48:30.880]  So lawsuits have been filed, St. Agnes Medical Center, Community Regional Medical Center,
[03:48:30.880 --> 03:48:36.600]  Clovis Community Medical Center, Kaiser Permanente in Riverside, Redlands Community Hospital,
[03:48:36.600 --> 03:48:38.260]  all kinds of hospitals too.
[03:48:38.260 --> 03:48:43.000]  This is the way we fight this and we make some change because if we don't, if we don't
[03:48:43.000 --> 03:48:50.840]  have the Scott Sheras in the world, we will succumb to total control of these hospitals.
[03:48:50.840 --> 03:48:55.280]  There will be no answer when you go to the hospitals and loved ones will be removed and
[03:48:55.280 --> 03:48:59.160]  they will make decisions for you and they will put you in a position where they give
[03:48:59.160 --> 03:49:04.200]  you horrifying experimental drugs and no one's going to call them out.
[03:49:04.200 --> 03:49:07.720]  And that's why I love Scott Shera and his family so much for doing what they're doing.
[03:49:07.720 --> 03:49:11.080]  They resisted the FEMA bribe, I'll call it a bribe.
[03:49:11.080 --> 03:49:14.200]  They resisted the FEMA bribes because when you signed on to that money, you had to sign
[03:49:14.200 --> 03:49:16.760]  on to never suing anybody.
[03:49:16.760 --> 03:49:20.800]  And they resisted that and they knew that they needed to fight this.
[03:49:20.800 --> 03:49:22.720]  And I'm so happy to hear this.
[03:49:22.720 --> 03:49:26.040]  How can people help you, Scott, in this fight?
[03:49:26.040 --> 03:49:31.400]  Well, the main thing they can do is share this message with other people because we
[03:49:31.400 --> 03:49:35.800]  got into this message or into this campaign to save lives.
[03:49:35.800 --> 03:49:40.960]  We're standing on Genesis 5020, what Satan meant for evil, God meant for good, the saving
[03:49:40.960 --> 03:49:41.960]  of many lives.
[03:49:41.960 --> 03:49:47.560]  So both physically and spiritually, physically share this message because if your belief does
[03:49:47.560 --> 03:49:53.440]  not change relative to hospitals, you are going to die in a hospital.
[03:49:53.440 --> 03:49:55.560]  Your best defense is to change your belief.
[03:49:55.560 --> 03:49:58.440]  So then by changing your belief, you become prepared.
[03:49:58.440 --> 03:50:00.040]  So share the message.
[03:50:00.040 --> 03:50:03.800]  Then spiritually, we see the time is very urgent.
[03:50:03.800 --> 03:50:06.440]  So what can you do spiritually?
[03:50:06.440 --> 03:50:11.280]  We are all responsible to God to do something with our talents, whether you have one talent
[03:50:11.280 --> 03:50:12.280]  or a hundred.
[03:50:12.280 --> 03:50:14.320]  I'm not expecting people to file lawsuits.
[03:50:14.320 --> 03:50:16.440]  We have the ability to do that.
[03:50:16.440 --> 03:50:20.280]  So God demands us to do it at a higher level than somebody else.
[03:50:20.280 --> 03:50:25.240]  But do something other than sitting on the couch and waiting for other people to do
[03:50:25.240 --> 03:50:26.240]  it.
[03:50:26.240 --> 03:50:30.440]  If we all do what our God-given talents are, we can stop this.
[03:50:30.440 --> 03:50:37.480]  And then if you're wanting to help us directly, we're asking people to go to GraceSharra.com,
[03:50:37.480 --> 03:50:42.600]  put in your name and email address, because we are going to have calls to action as this
[03:50:42.600 --> 03:50:45.640]  case proceeds, especially if I get sued for defamation.
[03:50:45.640 --> 03:50:48.120]  I mean, you know I'm out there.
[03:50:48.120 --> 03:50:49.360]  I'm doing interviews every day.
[03:50:49.360 --> 03:50:50.480]  I've been on over 600.
[03:50:50.480 --> 03:50:54.320]  I'm calling Grace's death murder, because that's what it is.
[03:50:54.320 --> 03:50:55.960]  And I don't care if I get sued.
[03:50:55.960 --> 03:50:59.960]  But if I get sued, we're going to have, obviously, another call to action.
[03:50:59.960 --> 03:51:03.880]  Right now, we're handling the lawsuit personally.
[03:51:03.880 --> 03:51:09.440]  But we're hoping to be able to utilize Grace's case for raising funds for other cases.
[03:51:09.440 --> 03:51:16.560]  There's 1.2 million Americans that this happened to in the 39 months of the plandemic, the
[03:51:16.560 --> 03:51:20.120]  scandemic, the pandemic, whatever you want to call it.
[03:51:20.120 --> 03:51:22.320]  And those families need help.
[03:51:22.320 --> 03:51:25.640]  And so we want to utilize Grace's case to raise money for other families.
[03:51:25.640 --> 03:51:30.280]  If you choose to donate, if you go to GraceSharra.com, after putting your name and email in, there
[03:51:30.280 --> 03:51:36.000]  is a donate button that links to our Give, Send, Go campaign.
[03:51:36.000 --> 03:51:37.000]  I love that.
[03:51:37.160 --> 03:51:43.280]  And I do hope people really help out, because you really are putting yourself out there
[03:51:43.280 --> 03:51:49.480]  for others right now in the name of Grace, which I love, because what a loving girl
[03:51:49.480 --> 03:51:52.200]  she was and caring girl.
[03:51:52.200 --> 03:51:54.520]  And I can't imagine this loss in your family.
[03:51:54.520 --> 03:51:56.040]  And I feel so bad for your family.
[03:51:56.040 --> 03:51:59.480]  And I feel bad for the families all over the country that have incurred this loss at the
[03:51:59.480 --> 03:52:00.480]  hands of the hospital.
[03:52:00.480 --> 03:52:04.360]  And many people were trying to get in, because they knew what they were up against, or they
[03:52:04.400 --> 03:52:09.520]  found out after some research, and the hospitals wouldn't let them in to be with their loved
[03:52:09.520 --> 03:52:10.520]  ones.
[03:52:10.520 --> 03:52:14.440]  And these hospitals need to be made held accountable for those kinds of decisions.
[03:52:14.440 --> 03:52:19.560]  I remember when they were telling me this in the ICU, oh, my gosh, you know, oh, it's
[03:52:19.560 --> 03:52:20.560]  just so sad.
[03:52:20.560 --> 03:52:21.560]  We had to keep people out.
[03:52:21.560 --> 03:52:22.560]  I said, no, you didn't.
[03:52:22.560 --> 03:52:24.000]  You didn't have to keep people out.
[03:52:24.000 --> 03:52:28.720]  There was nobody telling you this, and it takes the personnel at the hospital to resist
[03:52:28.720 --> 03:52:29.720]  these things.
[03:52:29.720 --> 03:52:36.120]  The only way that the HHS could do all of this is if they had willing doctors and nurses
[03:52:36.120 --> 03:52:39.560]  to go along with this and not question anything.
[03:52:39.560 --> 03:52:42.600]  And that needs to be exposed.
[03:52:42.600 --> 03:52:44.640]  I agree 100 percent.
[03:52:44.640 --> 03:52:48.080]  And the doctors and nurses I talk with, it's an embarrassment.
[03:52:48.080 --> 03:52:50.400]  I talk with a lady who's 66 years old.
[03:52:50.400 --> 03:52:55.840]  She's a nurse in a hospital in Appleton, Wisconsin, and she originally said that I was lying.
[03:52:55.840 --> 03:53:00.120]  She found out that I wasn't because the hospital she was a nurse at, and she's the power of
[03:53:00.120 --> 03:53:04.160]  attorney for her dad, the doctor put an illegal DNR order on her dad.
[03:53:04.160 --> 03:53:08.440]  When I talked with her, I asked her if she'd come on radio and TV with me to help save
[03:53:08.440 --> 03:53:09.440]  lives.
[03:53:09.440 --> 03:53:12.680]  And she said, I can't, I'm a year away from retirement, and I don't want to jeopardize
[03:53:12.680 --> 03:53:13.680]  my job.
[03:53:13.680 --> 03:53:22.920]  So this is, these people are accessories to the mass genocide that has happened in, I
[03:53:23.520 --> 03:53:28.960]  mean, it's been going on for a long time, but was exposed in this 39 month period.
[03:53:30.040 --> 03:53:31.280]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:53:31.280 --> 03:53:37.040]  You know, I spoke with Reggie Littlejohn yesterday, interviewed her, and we talked about the
[03:53:37.600 --> 03:53:43.440]  the last NADA and on page nine hundred and ninety two, there's the pandemic treaty that
[03:53:43.440 --> 03:53:48.640]  went through that basically put all these agencies like the WHO, it was like a ready
[03:53:48.640 --> 03:53:54.080]  made Congress signed off on kind of deal where we would add all of these things coming.
[03:53:54.320 --> 03:53:58.320]  And the only reason they would do that is if they had more things planned for us.
[03:53:59.080 --> 03:54:04.320]  And if they do, and if they try to do this, we will be in the same predicament again.
[03:54:04.840 --> 03:54:06.960]  And we have got to stop that from happening.
[03:54:06.960 --> 03:54:11.400]  We've actually have to do something to make this so that this is not going on all over
[03:54:11.400 --> 03:54:16.360]  the country. I had many tearful people calling me and messaging me and begging for help,
[03:54:16.640 --> 03:54:18.840]  and they weren't receiving help.
[03:54:18.840 --> 03:54:20.120]  And I felt so bad.
[03:54:20.120 --> 03:54:24.480]  The frontline doctors were the only ones that were actually helping people and having
[03:54:24.480 --> 03:54:27.600]  them understand what they could do, like my husband, to get them out.
[03:54:27.600 --> 03:54:28.720]  And that's what saved my husband.
[03:54:28.720 --> 03:54:30.200]  So there are some good doctors.
[03:54:30.480 --> 03:54:33.720]  But for the majority, what I learned was that they aren't curious.
[03:54:33.720 --> 03:54:34.720]  They won't read up.
[03:54:34.720 --> 03:54:36.280]  They will not look at studies.
[03:54:36.280 --> 03:54:39.640]  They don't care because it's about the job, like you said.
[03:54:39.640 --> 03:54:44.720]  And, you know, I work with somebody that's constantly saying, Uncle Milti, that's
[03:54:44.720 --> 03:54:47.640]  constantly saying, you know, people will put on the brown shirt.
[03:54:48.200 --> 03:54:50.960]  And that's what's happening in our country right now.
[03:54:50.960 --> 03:54:52.160]  And we better stop it.
[03:54:52.160 --> 03:54:56.920]  We've got to stop putting all of our careers and everything ahead of people's lives.
[03:54:56.920 --> 03:54:58.000]  This is not OK.
[03:54:58.360 --> 03:55:03.360]  Any final thoughts for you, Scott, things that you want to warn people about and let
[03:55:03.360 --> 03:55:04.800]  people know about in your case?
[03:55:07.080 --> 03:55:12.000]  Not just about my case, but, you know, you gave a call to action that we have to stop
[03:55:12.000 --> 03:55:14.240]  this. So how can we stop this?
[03:55:14.440 --> 03:55:17.720]  And I would say it isn't about an action.
[03:55:17.720 --> 03:55:19.480]  It's about an attitude of the heart.
[03:55:19.480 --> 03:55:25.080]  How they snagged us with this first go around is through fear propaganda.
[03:55:25.280 --> 03:55:29.080]  And we know that Satan loves lies, deception and fear.
[03:55:29.360 --> 03:55:31.560]  So the fear propaganda is going to happen again.
[03:55:31.560 --> 03:55:36.600]  We don't know how it's going to expose itself with this next round or whatever they
[03:55:36.600 --> 03:55:39.680]  have planned. But we know that that is going to be the tactic.
[03:55:40.000 --> 03:55:45.160]  And I would say out of all the things that I have learned so that I'm prepared for the
[03:55:45.160 --> 03:55:50.760]  next round is to not let fear control my thoughts, which then control my actions.
[03:55:50.920 --> 03:55:53.240]  And that's what I'd like to leave the audience with.
[03:55:53.600 --> 03:55:56.640]  It is it's critical that we don't let fear control us.
[03:55:56.880 --> 03:56:01.680]  If we would have as a country not let fear control us, this thing would have over.
[03:56:02.840 --> 03:56:04.240]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:56:04.440 --> 03:56:08.880]  You know, a pandemic is when people fall dead all around you, I mean, on the street or
[03:56:08.880 --> 03:56:11.840]  at the store, at the post office, all those places we could go.
[03:56:11.840 --> 03:56:14.840]  Right. So it's not a pandemic.
[03:56:14.840 --> 03:56:20.240]  If the only place they die is in the ICU on an experimental drug, if they're on an
[03:56:20.240 --> 03:56:24.640]  experimental drug and a ventilator too soon and they're trying to tell you you're in a
[03:56:24.640 --> 03:56:29.360]  pandemic, unless you're seeing this in front of your eyeballs, we are not in a
[03:56:29.360 --> 03:56:32.120]  pandemic. But everybody refers to it as a pandemic.
[03:56:32.120 --> 03:56:36.560]  And everybody talks about what we just went through as if it happened, but it wasn't
[03:56:36.560 --> 03:56:38.080]  even in front of our own faces.
[03:56:38.080 --> 03:56:39.600]  It must have been happening everywhere else.
[03:56:39.600 --> 03:56:41.760]  Right. That's kind of the attitude.
[03:56:41.760 --> 03:56:45.800]  Like you said, we need an attitude adjustment when mainstream media goes all in on
[03:56:45.800 --> 03:56:48.800]  something from day one and no one asks a single question.
[03:56:48.920 --> 03:56:50.240]  You know, you're being played.
[03:56:51.440 --> 03:56:57.560]  Yeah, I mean, I was not awake till after Grace died, I'm awake now and these are my
[03:56:57.560 --> 03:57:02.840]  wife just sent me an article this morning about a local man who was prominent that that
[03:57:02.880 --> 03:57:08.640]  died of supposedly of COVID, but it was in the mainstream media and it's how they do
[03:57:08.640 --> 03:57:15.280]  it. Now I know about the alternative media and I encourage everybody to find reliable
[03:57:15.280 --> 03:57:20.360]  alternative media sources like this one and share it with your friends because the
[03:57:20.360 --> 03:57:23.120]  mainstream media is all in on this.
[03:57:23.120 --> 03:57:25.640]  Everybody's in on this propaganda campaign.
[03:57:26.640 --> 03:57:27.880]  Thank you, Scott Shara.
[03:57:27.880 --> 03:57:34.160]  Our amazing Grace Dotnet and Grace Shara Dotcom, please go to these websites and help
[03:57:34.160 --> 03:57:35.680]  out. They need your help.
[03:57:35.720 --> 03:57:40.360]  They need your support, too, and learn about her story and what happened to her so we
[03:57:40.360 --> 03:57:41.680]  can prevent it from happening again.
[03:57:41.680 --> 03:57:44.600]  I'm Kate Daly from the Kate Daly Show for Alex Jones.
[03:57:45.600 --> 03:57:50.600]  You're going to want to pay attention to what I'm about to say in the next 60 seconds.
[03:57:50.600 --> 03:57:55.600]  Two new incredible products are now available exclusively at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:57:55.600 --> 03:58:01.600]  They are both clones of national best-selling products from a major pharmaceutical-slash-supplement maker
[03:58:01.600 --> 03:58:03.600]  that are listeners and patriots.
[03:58:03.600 --> 03:58:07.600]  They're allowing us to private label it at a lower price you'll find in stores.
[03:58:07.600 --> 03:58:11.600]  It's Joint, Relief Max, and Nerve Renew.
[03:58:12.600 --> 03:58:17.600]  Both of these have known, documented natural compounds to lower pain
[03:58:17.600 --> 03:58:22.600]  and to also make your nerves healthier, which is one of the major reasons nerves get irritated
[03:58:22.600 --> 03:58:25.600]  and are more inductive to pain.
[03:58:25.600 --> 03:58:27.600]  There's major research behind this all.
[03:58:27.600 --> 03:58:33.600]  You need to get Joint, Relief Max from InfoWarsMD and Nerve Renew from InfoWarsMD

[03:58:46.600 --> 03:58:50.600]  They decided to not perp walking, not put him in handcuffs, not do a mugshot
[03:58:50.600 --> 03:58:52.600]  because they knew that that would help Trump.
[03:58:52.600 --> 03:58:54.600]  Didn't they know this would backfire?
[03:58:54.600 --> 03:58:56.600]  We were waiting for the mugshot.
[03:58:56.600 --> 03:58:58.600]  We learned today they wouldn't have it, so we've made our own.
[03:58:58.600 --> 03:59:03.600]  And it says political prisoner with an image of President Trump.
[03:59:03.600 --> 03:59:05.600]  The shirt is being printed now in Texas.
[03:59:05.600 --> 03:59:07.600]  It will be shipping out to you in one week.
[03:59:07.600 --> 03:59:11.600]  Political prisoner with Trump on the front.
[03:59:11.600 --> 03:59:14.600]  They're in a mugshot jail background.
[03:59:14.600 --> 03:59:15.600]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[03:59:15.600 --> 03:59:19.600]  It says InfoWars.com on the back of the shirt.
[03:59:19.600 --> 03:59:21.600]  We also have Alex Jones for president.
[03:59:21.600 --> 03:59:22.600]  No, I'm not running for president.
[03:59:22.600 --> 03:59:25.600]  It's a really nice navy blue high-quality shirt, red, white, and blue.
[03:59:25.600 --> 03:59:27.600]  Alex Jones for president 2024.
[03:59:27.600 --> 03:59:30.600]  It's a fun conversational piece and a limited edition shirt.
[03:59:30.600 --> 03:59:32.600]  Great way to fund the operation.
