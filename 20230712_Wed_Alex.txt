[00:00:07.168 --> 00:00:14.115]  The Sound of Freedom was completed five years ago, but Disney fought them in the courts to keep it from being released.
[00:00:14.115 --> 00:00:29.189]  Hollywood employs several convicted pedophiles, and mostly at Disney and Nickelodeon, who specialize in children's programming, and have even rehired pedophiles after they've served light sentences for raping child actors.
[00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.572]  Hollywood has been abusing children since its inception,
[00:00:33.112 --> 00:00:48.598]  Including child actors of the 1930s, such as Shirley Temple, Mickey Rooney, and Judy Garland, who wrote that she was constantly molested behind the scenes by powerful men, including MGM co-founder Louis B. Mayer.
[00:00:48.598 --> 00:00:52.159]  And nothing has stopped Hollywood from continuing this horrific abuse.
[00:00:52.919 --> 00:00:57.680]  It has been known for decades that governments have systemically abused children.
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:09.123]  Beginning in the 1960s, the German government began placing thousands of foster children into the homes of single pedophiles, and continued doing it up until the 1990s.
[00:01:09.123 --> 00:01:15.225]  Thousands of Catholic priests have been accused of raping children, and no justice has ever come of it.
[00:01:15.905 --> 00:01:24.928]  Jeffrey Epstein was targeting individuals and recording them raping children as a form of blackmail, so that powerful entities could control them.
[00:01:24.928 --> 00:01:29.190]  Epstein has disappeared, and so has this little black book.
[00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:34.592]  Many have claimed that Hugh Hefner was doing the same thing for the CIA that Epstein was doing.
[00:01:34.592 --> 00:01:43.035]  In 1976, Hefner's Playboy magazine published erotic nude pictures of a 10-year-old girl, and nobody seemed to care.
[00:01:43.735 --> 00:01:49.620]  The effects on these children can often be fatal, whether it's from blunt trauma or suicide.
[00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.664]  And those who survive most often struggle with it for their entire life.
[00:01:54.664 --> 00:01:58.747]  To me, sexual abuse, it kills a child.
[00:01:58.747 --> 00:02:00.849]  I think it kills the spirit of a child.
[00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:03.712]  I think it kills normalcy in a child.
[00:02:04.697 --> 00:02:13.920]  So I just have spent a great deal of my life, you know, walking around really as a dead person in a sense, because I almost feel like I was murdered.
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:24.923]  Child abuse has been used as a form of trauma-based mind control because it often forces the child to disassociate, which has been known to create multiple personalities.
[00:02:24.923 --> 00:02:33.006]  MKUltra whistleblower Kathy O'Brien came from a family of multi-generational child abuse that sold her to the US government.
[00:02:33.166 --> 00:02:48.808]  I developed a compartment in my brain, a little area behind amnesic barriers that was actually the neuron pathway shutting down in my brain in order to compartmentalize the memory of abuse so that the rest of my mind could function normally as though nothing had happened.
[00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:53.793]  My father's sexual abuse expanded into child pornography.
[00:02:53.793 --> 00:02:56.795]  And he was sending this child pornography of me through the U.S.
[00:02:56.795 --> 00:02:57.816]  mails.
[00:02:57.816 --> 00:02:59.557]  And he was caught.
[00:02:59.557 --> 00:03:06.502]  The pornography was confiscated by a criminal faction of our government.
[00:03:06.502 --> 00:03:18.272]  A local politician approached my father and told him that he would receive immunity from prosecution if he would sell me into the CIA's MKUltra Project Monarch.
[00:03:19.312 --> 00:03:24.913]  Some families practice incest and pedophilia to gain power and to maintain it.
[00:03:24.913 --> 00:03:32.874]  Inbred Jacob Rothschild explains it here while reading a quote from his inbred relative, James Rothschild.
[00:03:32.874 --> 00:03:39.575]  In our family, we've always tried to keep love in the family.
[00:03:39.575 --> 00:03:48.557]  In this sense, it was more or less understood since childhood that children would never think of marrying outside the family.
[00:03:54.758 --> 00:03:58.442]  Our entire system is profiting from child slavery.
[00:03:58.442 --> 00:04:01.905]  About 10 billion dollars a year in the US alone.
[00:04:01.905 --> 00:04:04.867]  And our entire government seems to be involved.
[00:04:04.867 --> 00:04:09.512]  Congress has paid millions of our tax dollars to cover up their sex abuse crimes.
[00:04:10.032 --> 00:04:14.214]  Thousands of children are being trafficked across our southern border.
[00:04:14.214 --> 00:04:20.816]  And now it's become trendy to castrate children and turn them into a so-called transgender.
[00:04:20.816 --> 00:04:27.299]  And if we the people don't do something about this, then the blossoming surveillance state will have a solution.
[00:04:27.299 --> 00:04:35.962]  Don't be surprised if our children are soon monitored 24-7 under the guise of keeping them safe because we have failed to do so.
[00:04:36.802 --> 00:04:43.409]  While we cannot expect to rid the earth of all evil, something obviously needs to be done.
[00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:45.872]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:05:00.492 --> 00:05:02.673]  The globalists are only humans.
[00:05:02.673 --> 00:05:06.676]  Yeah, they have control of the central banks, they have a lot of power, but they can be defeated.
[00:05:06.676 --> 00:05:09.898]  But some of their operations are going to take decades to stop.
[00:05:09.898 --> 00:05:18.103]  But one thing you can do right now is take control of your body and your family's body by purifying the water that you drink and that you cook with.
[00:05:18.103 --> 00:05:21.705]  And you do it with the highest quality gravity-fed filter out there.
[00:05:21.705 --> 00:05:22.545]  This thing does 10,000 gallons
[00:05:23.906 --> 00:05:26.627]  You can sit there and put hundreds of gallons through in a day.
[00:05:26.627 --> 00:05:31.188]  It purifies very quickly and it cuts out thousands of chemicals to non-detectable levels.
[00:05:31.188 --> 00:05:33.189]  This is what I use, which my family uses.
[00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:35.350]  It's the very best system out there for the lowest price.
[00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:38.131]  For a limited time, 10% off on top of that.

[00:05:48.914 --> 00:05:49.776]  Don't procrastinate.
[00:05:49.776 --> 00:05:56.769]  This is one of the main areas we can take control of our lives and stop the globalists from hitting us with poison that they allow in the water supply.
[00:05:56.769 --> 00:05:59.233]  In some cases they add the water supply like fluoride.
[00:06:05.467 --> 00:06:07.208]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:06:07.208 --> 00:06:18.396]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:18.396 --> 00:06:29.685]  Right now, disgraced FBI Deep State Director Christopher Wray is testifying before Congress and being destroyed.
[00:06:32.563 --> 00:06:37.514]  How many illegal FISA queries have occurred under your leadership of the FBI?
[00:06:40.316 --> 00:06:45.517]  Well, there are reports that have come out with different numbers about compliance incidents.
[00:06:45.517 --> 00:06:47.118]  More than a million?
[00:06:47.118 --> 00:06:47.878]  Illegal ones?
[00:06:47.878 --> 00:06:49.658]  Because that's what the Inspector General said.
[00:06:49.658 --> 00:06:56.300]  The Inspector General said that in the 3.4 million of these queries, more than a million were in error.
[00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:59.441]  Do you have any basis to disagree with that assessment by the Inspector General?
[00:06:59.441 --> 00:07:04.182]  I'm not sure actually that's a correct characterization of the Inspector General's
[00:07:04.642 --> 00:07:08.164]  Oh well, the internet will remind you of that in moments.
[00:07:08.164 --> 00:07:11.926]  But let's now go to what the court said.
[00:07:11.926 --> 00:07:15.648]  The court said it was over 200,000 that have occurred on your watch.
[00:07:15.648 --> 00:07:18.029]  Do you have any basis to disagree with that assessment?
[00:07:18.029 --> 00:07:19.911]  Again, I don't have the numbers I sit here right now.
[00:07:19.911 --> 00:07:22.232]  Seems like a number you should know!
[00:07:22.232 --> 00:07:26.114]  How many times the FBI's breaking the law under your watch?
[00:07:26.114 --> 00:07:27.435]  I'm sitting here with my father.
[00:07:28.416 --> 00:07:38.421]  I will make certain that between the man sitting next to me and every person he knows and my ability to forever hold a grudge, that you will regret not following my direction.
[00:07:38.421 --> 00:07:43.484]  I am sitting here, waiting for the call with my father.
[00:07:43.484 --> 00:07:47.866]  Sounds like a shakedown, doesn't it, Director?
[00:07:47.866 --> 00:07:50.448]  I'm not going to get into commenting on that.
[00:07:50.448 --> 00:07:53.769]  You seem deeply uncurious about it, don't you?
[00:07:53.769 --> 00:07:55.490]  Almost suspiciously uncurious.
[00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:56.591]  Are you protecting the Bidens?
[00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:58.880]  Absolutely not.
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:01.261]  The FBI does not and has no interest in protecting anyone.
[00:08:01.261 --> 00:08:06.343]  You won't answer the question about whether or not that's a shakedown, and everybody knows why you won't answer it.
[00:08:06.343 --> 00:08:10.784]  Because to the millions of people who will see this, they know it is.
[00:08:10.784 --> 00:08:14.205]  And your inability to acknowledge that is deeply revealing about you.
[00:08:14.205 --> 00:08:20.027]  The deep state is on the ropes.
[00:08:20.027 --> 00:08:23.308]  And the more they fight back, the weaker they're going to get.
[00:08:23.308 --> 00:08:26.849]  All we've got to do is keep spreading the word and keep exposing the globalists.
[00:08:27.671 --> 00:08:30.392]  They're going down, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:30.392 --> 00:08:35.132]  But for those of us at the front line, the tip of the spear, we've got to be willing to give up our lives.
[00:08:35.132 --> 00:08:37.473]  We've got to be willing to be put in prison.
[00:08:37.473 --> 00:08:39.273]  We've got to be willing to have them go off for our families.
[00:08:39.273 --> 00:08:46.735]  That's the commitment I've made to you because God's watching.
[00:08:46.735 --> 00:08:47.855]  I don't do this because I'm a hero.
[00:08:47.855 --> 00:08:53.036]  I do it because evil must be faced and God works through us to deliver justice.
[00:08:54.657 --> 00:08:56.839]  Oh, incredible transmission today.
[00:08:56.839 --> 00:09:02.964]  Wow, but the Chris Wray being destroyed in Congress right now.
[00:09:02.964 --> 00:09:16.575]  And a major federal ruling, federal judge denies government motion to stay injunction by another federal court in landmark free speech case that's all about deep state surveillance, censorship, criminal racketeering.
[00:09:16.575 --> 00:09:17.256]  That's happening.
[00:09:17.256 --> 00:09:20.399]  A lot of good news and some really dangerous news.
[00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:24.060]  We'll be getting into that a little bit later as well.
[00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:26.121]  And that's the situation in Ukraine.
[00:09:26.121 --> 00:09:28.141]  I don't like Zelensky.
[00:09:28.141 --> 00:09:29.201]  I don't like NATO.
[00:09:29.201 --> 00:09:32.102]  I don't like the war.
[00:09:32.102 --> 00:09:38.883]  But that said, I don't like the fact that Putin took the bait in the proxy war and upped the ante because I knew it would escalate.
[00:09:38.883 --> 00:09:41.323]  Now it is escalating out of control.
[00:09:41.323 --> 00:09:44.324]  And Zelensky is a very, very dangerous man.
[00:09:44.324 --> 00:09:46.224]  And he's now threatening NATO.
[00:09:46.224 --> 00:09:49.245]  And remember, he's letting the world know what his threat is.
[00:09:49.245 --> 00:09:50.645]  He's going to blow up
[00:09:51.334 --> 00:09:59.636]  The giant nuclear power plant, the biggest in Europe, and blame it on the Russians to try to suck NATO fully into the war.
[00:09:59.636 --> 00:10:03.617]  And the Ukrainians have really gotten too big for their britches.
[00:10:03.617 --> 00:10:09.499]  That is, the people in Kiev running the show are a danger to the entire planet.
[00:10:09.499 --> 00:10:15.061]  And I don't think Zelensky, if he keeps running his mouth, is going to be above ground very long.
[00:10:15.061 --> 00:10:17.361]  And when I say that, it's not a threat from me to Zelensky.
[00:10:17.361 --> 00:10:18.542]  I know geopolitics.
[00:10:18.542 --> 00:10:19.762]  I know how the globalists operate.
[00:10:20.535 --> 00:10:29.577]  And if he starts thinking that he actually calls the shots, he's going to be, yeah, in the same club as Saddam Hussein and some of Bin Laden and others.
[00:10:29.577 --> 00:10:34.379]  And hell, even Gaddafi tried to come in out of the dark and do whatever the globalists wanted and they still killed him.
[00:10:34.379 --> 00:10:36.279]  So this is very dangerous.
[00:10:36.279 --> 00:10:37.900]  This is how you escalate a nuclear war.
[00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:38.700]  I'll be laying that out.
[00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:48.803]  But let's just cut live to the Congressional House Oversight Committee hearing that's going on with Jim Jordan.
[00:10:48.803 --> 00:10:49.563]  Absolutely not.
[00:10:50.811 --> 00:10:51.874]  Thank you very much.
[00:10:51.874 --> 00:10:53.137]  Let me thank you as well.
[00:10:53.137 --> 00:10:56.585]  Let's hear Jackson Lee slobber all over.
[00:10:56.585 --> 00:10:58.470]  Let's hear a little bit of the other side.
[00:10:59.369 --> 00:11:00.009]  The Kenyira Committee.
[00:11:00.009 --> 00:11:00.750]  Hit pause.
[00:11:25.619 --> 00:11:27.321]  I know it's live, you can't hit pause.
[00:11:27.321 --> 00:11:37.309]  The Democrats literally say burning down cities is good, killing cops is good, random violence is good, and they're trying to float this idea that white supremacy is the number one crime in this country.
[00:11:37.309 --> 00:11:38.750]  It's not even on the radar.
[00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:47.877]  They create this own little special pie of extremist violence and then only report the few white extremist events and then say it's the majority of crime.
[00:11:50.051 --> 00:11:54.915]  It's like saying, in my backyard, the biggest plant is that one inch blade of grass.
[00:11:54.915 --> 00:11:58.678]  But you've got a one square area you're looking at in the backyard.
[00:11:58.678 --> 00:12:03.982]  My backyard is this square inch, and the biggest thing is this one inch piece of grass next to a 200 foot tree.
[00:12:03.982 --> 00:12:07.705]  But see, it's not in the graph, that's how they're lying by the statistics.
[00:12:07.705 --> 00:12:09.947]  But we don't need to be statisticians to know that.
[00:12:09.947 --> 00:12:12.569]  Are there white supremacists running around murdering people everywhere?
[00:12:12.569 --> 00:12:13.130]  No, they're not.
[00:12:15.148 --> 00:12:18.311]  They got articles out saying if you're in good shape, you're a white supremacist.
[00:12:18.311 --> 00:12:20.472]  I mean, it's getting dumber.
[00:12:20.472 --> 00:12:23.134]  They're now saying Asians are the number one white supremacist group.
[00:12:23.134 --> 00:12:24.355]  I'm going to show you these articles.
[00:12:24.355 --> 00:12:29.600]  This is a desperate globalist state that wants us all killing each other.
[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:34.644]  But you know, I said I'd listen to her, even though it's super annoying, because we're going to hear some of the other live stuff from Republicans.
[00:12:34.644 --> 00:12:36.085]  So let's go back to Jackson Lee.
[00:12:37.406 --> 00:12:42.208]  Unlike what's happening in law enforcement more generally, is actually up very significantly.
[00:12:42.208 --> 00:12:42.728]  Thank you.
[00:12:42.728 --> 00:12:44.069]  And I look forward to it being diverse.
[00:12:44.069 --> 00:12:48.111]  Let me start with our whistleblower journey here.
[00:12:48.111 --> 00:12:54.494]  Are you familiar with FBI Special Agents Kyle Serpin?
[00:12:54.494 --> 00:12:56.435]  I'm familiar with the name.
[00:12:56.435 --> 00:12:56.915]  Is that yes?
[00:12:58.348 --> 00:12:59.369]  I'm familiar with the name.
[00:12:59.369 --> 00:13:01.110]  I'm sorry, I can't listen to this.
[00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:01.651]  Just turn it off.
[00:13:27.475 --> 00:13:32.980]  I told you we could listen to it, but I'm not going to subject anybody to that.
[00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:35.942]  Unbelievable garbage.
[00:13:35.942 --> 00:13:38.665]  Okay, let me tell you what we're getting to today.
[00:13:40.851 --> 00:14:00.857]  We have a lot of new developments on PedoGate, and the great hero Tim Ballard, whose organization helped save over 6,000 children over the last decade, and who has put thousands of pedos behind bars, and the corporate media jumping the shark and saying that it's all fake, nothing's happening, and it gets a lot worse.
[00:14:03.632 --> 00:14:09.074]  They've busted more pedo rings all over the country with the actual drug to kidnap children.
[00:14:09.074 --> 00:14:20.898]  Every day, they find a dungeon or a basement full of a bunch of kidnapped kids with some handler running them, and they find the cell phone numbers to hire-ups that have them in the safe houses.
[00:14:20.898 --> 00:14:23.479]  I've seen five of those stories in the last two days.
[00:14:23.479 --> 00:14:26.420]  I've got those, I've got local newscasts.
[00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:30.581]  And you're probably going to ask, why are we not hearing about this on the national news?
[00:14:30.581 --> 00:14:33.062]  Well, why does Biden starting a month ago
[00:14:34.398 --> 00:14:49.664]  Not allow the Border Patrol to DNA test people when they have no ID, they don't look like the child, and it's a federal law regulation, but Biden's getting rid of the funding for it, where they're going to turn children loose with no DNA testing.
[00:14:49.664 --> 00:14:50.965]  But it gets worse, as I said yesterday.
[00:14:50.965 --> 00:14:54.346]  So I'm going to go back over this too.
[00:14:54.346 --> 00:15:02.069]  They've taken kidnapped children and child sex slavery and a bunch of other terms to report it off of the Justice Department website.
[00:15:03.174 --> 00:15:12.883]  So when you go there, to go, oh, okay, I'm going to call the bank robbery, or I'm going to call the white collar crime thing, or I'm going to go send a tip, I'm going to send a tip on sex slavery and child sex driving.
[00:15:12.883 --> 00:15:14.965]  Oh, sorry, that isn't on the menu.
[00:15:14.965 --> 00:15:18.489]  It'd be like if you called the fire department.
[00:15:18.489 --> 00:15:20.410]  I want to report my neighbor's house on fire.
[00:15:20.410 --> 00:15:21.712]  Well, fires don't exist.
[00:15:21.712 --> 00:15:22.893]  We don't have that.
[00:15:22.893 --> 00:15:26.156]  That's not a thing that's on the... What do you mean?
[00:15:26.156 --> 00:15:26.896]  What does the fire department do?
[00:15:26.896 --> 00:15:28.338]  Well, we go to automobile accidents.
[00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:31.581]  Well, what if a car was on fire?
[00:15:31.581 --> 00:15:35.322]  Well, sir, fire doesn't exist.
[00:15:35.322 --> 00:15:37.944]  I mean, that's the level of the mind control.
[00:15:37.944 --> 00:15:39.865]  Fathers and mothers don't exist.
[00:15:39.865 --> 00:15:40.985]  Two genders don't exist.
[00:15:40.985 --> 00:15:43.966]  It's all just cult brainwashing.
[00:15:43.966 --> 00:15:47.808]  Gravity doesn't exist.
[00:15:47.808 --> 00:15:50.910]  It's 1984.
[00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:54.111]  So, we're going to cover everything today.
[00:15:54.111 --> 00:15:55.392]  It's going to be a massive broadcast.
[00:15:55.392 --> 00:15:55.792]  Stay with us.
[00:16:00.049 --> 00:16:06.412]  The globalists aren't just targeting us through the poison shots or the electromagnetic 5G or the GMO crops.
[00:16:06.412 --> 00:16:12.834]  They're hitting us with hundreds of chemicals that the EPA has authorized companies and industry to use.
[00:16:12.834 --> 00:16:16.196]  One of the top pesticides used is Atrazine.
[00:16:16.196 --> 00:16:25.360]  The allowable level the government admits that they allow to be in your water supply is enough to sterilize you and basically turn your son into a feminized mutant.
[00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:25.820]  Look it up.
[00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:27.800]  Don't let them do this to your family.
[00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:31.021]  We have the very best gravity-fed filter system out there.
[00:16:31.021 --> 00:16:34.162]  Highest rated at half the price of leading competitors.
[00:16:34.162 --> 00:16:36.482]  The Alexa Pure, ready to ship to you right now.
[00:16:36.482 --> 00:16:39.103]  We have replacement filters for folks who have already gotten it.
[00:16:39.103 --> 00:16:40.703]  It does 10,000 gallons before you replace them.
[00:16:40.703 --> 00:16:41.704]  It is amazing.
[00:16:41.704 --> 00:16:43.344]  It's great for your home, your business.
[00:16:43.344 --> 00:16:46.545]  You can put swamp water in it, tap water, well water.
[00:16:46.545 --> 00:16:47.965]  Almost everything is contaminated.
[00:16:47.965 --> 00:16:51.726]  This is how you take control of the fluids in your body and counter the globalist onslaught.

[00:16:59.791 --> 00:17:04.254]  In the short time we have, I can't get into all the incredible ingredients and super-fuel mentality.

[00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:30.410]  It boosts men.
[00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:31.431]  It boosts women.
[00:17:31.431 --> 00:17:32.192]  It works great.
[00:17:32.192 --> 00:17:34.073]  But women like pink labels.
[00:17:34.073 --> 00:17:36.035]  Men like different color labels.
[00:17:36.035 --> 00:17:38.076]  So it works for men as well.
[00:17:38.076 --> 00:17:39.137]  It's the same formula.
[00:17:39.137 --> 00:17:40.398]  It's an incredible formula.
[00:17:40.398 --> 00:17:41.339]  And it funds our operation.
[00:17:41.339 --> 00:17:43.040]  And there's another important part of the

[00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:01.180]  You wanted to plug RainForce.
[00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:02.261]  Do you like RainForce?
[00:18:02.261 --> 00:18:04.802]  Yeah, so my name is Ken Heckenladly.
[00:18:04.802 --> 00:18:07.063]  How do I write all the books that I do?
[00:18:07.063 --> 00:18:13.346]  Four books with Dr. Judy Majkowicz, four books with Project Veritas Whistleblowers, and now two books with Alex Jones?
[00:18:13.346 --> 00:18:16.407]  That's because I use RainForce every day.
[00:18:16.747 --> 00:18:20.731]  What I always need is I always need some sort of boost in the morning.
[00:18:20.731 --> 00:18:24.674]  And so, you know, I try to exercise, eat well, take good vitamins.
[00:18:24.674 --> 00:18:30.259]  But the one thing that I have really found that makes a difference is brain force.
[00:18:30.259 --> 00:18:37.946]  I'll take brain force in the morning right before I go to my computer and I'm good for the next four or five hours writing a whole lot of stuff.
[00:18:37.946 --> 00:18:43.611]  So it really is true that brain force is something I use every day and it helps me with my writing.
[00:18:43.991 --> 00:18:44.791]  All right, we love you.
[00:18:44.791 --> 00:18:45.412]  We'll be right back.

[00:19:18.465 --> 00:19:27.429]  If you really want to treat yourself to something nice, get yourself an Alexa Pure water filter and get clean, healthy water whenever you want it, wherever you want it.
[00:19:27.429 --> 00:19:33.671]  Even if the water pressure goes out, the Gravity Fed water filter has got you covered.
[00:19:33.671 --> 00:19:34.231]  Absolutely.
[00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:39.701]  Couldn't do any of this without listener support.
[00:19:39.701 --> 00:19:42.522]  I was telling Greg earlier, we're like the real NPR.
[00:19:42.522 --> 00:19:44.242]  The real NPR of The Based Right.

[00:20:25.545 --> 00:20:38.730]  I've tried living it risky, relied on women and whiskey, chased my blues, turned my nights to days.
[00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:44.992]  First rage, only a pastime, with age more than a lifetime.
[00:20:44.992 --> 00:20:49.853]  Day in, day out, the world just turns away.
[00:20:49.853 --> 00:20:50.934]  Welcome back, my friends!
[00:20:52.225 --> 00:20:55.266]  You live, you learn.
[00:21:18.028 --> 00:21:21.687]  All right, let's go back to some of the clips, then we'll go back to some of the live event.
[00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:50.815]  Chris Wray, the FBI, the Justice Department, the logjam that allows the illegal human trafficking of hundreds of thousands if not millions of children into sex slavery, sweatshop slavery, you name it, that allows the fentanyl to pour in, that allows all the Democratic Party corruption, that allows all the persecution of innocent conservatives and Christians, who allows all the money laundering through Ukraine, allows all the Chinese agents inside the Democratic Party offices,
[00:21:51.835 --> 00:21:52.356]  We're good to go.
[00:22:09.437 --> 00:22:12.579]  That let the criminals that have hijacked our government stay in power.
[00:22:12.579 --> 00:22:14.060]  And the world knows it.
[00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:15.701]  And the statistics show it.
[00:22:15.701 --> 00:22:19.603]  And the FBI is the most unpopular federal agency there is.
[00:22:19.603 --> 00:22:21.384]  Congress has a 9% approval rating.
[00:22:21.384 --> 00:22:23.466]  The FBI has less than 10% approval rating.
[00:22:23.466 --> 00:22:26.127]  The mainstream media has less than 10% approval rating.
[00:22:26.127 --> 00:22:29.309]  The people know they're a plague.
[00:22:29.309 --> 00:22:33.572]  It doesn't mean everybody in mainstream media or everybody in the government or everybody in the FBI is bad.
[00:22:33.572 --> 00:22:34.973]  But the people running
[00:22:36.038 --> 00:22:44.061]  The corporate media and the Justice Department and the Democratic Party are very bad, ruthless, crazy people.
[00:22:44.061 --> 00:22:59.348]  And the good news is it's coming out that they're illegally surveilling everybody, election meddling, and censoring with big tech and big companies, and it's in their own documents, that it's for political control, and it doesn't get more totalitarian than that.
[00:23:00.490 --> 00:23:11.553]  A literal ministry of truth is what the federal judge said two weeks ago when he blocked Biden from coordinating censorship with Big Tech.
[00:23:11.553 --> 00:23:23.877]  And just since this ruling two weeks ago, and now another higher court just blocked the attempt to lift the injunction, so Biden just lost again, his controllers just lost again.
[00:23:23.877 --> 00:23:26.898]  I have noticed, because I know how to track this stuff just with my eyes,
[00:23:28.035 --> 00:23:34.324]  Looking at it and going over it, the censorship has absolutely mitigated
[00:23:37.242 --> 00:23:47.110]  When I say mitigated, not total, but there's been an absolute mitigation, a large dial-back of censorship on Facebook, on Instagram, on YouTube, on Google.
[00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:49.232]  I mean, I've seen a marked example.
[00:23:49.232 --> 00:23:54.036]  And I'm not going to give our enemies that watch all day at Media Matters that help quarterback this examples.
[00:23:54.036 --> 00:23:55.477]  I'm sure they're seeing it too.
[00:23:55.477 --> 00:23:58.660]  They'll have articles out saying, look, why aren't you blocking this now?
[00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:01.082]  So, because it's a freaking crime.
[00:24:01.082 --> 00:24:03.684]  That's why.
[00:24:03.684 --> 00:24:03.884]  So,
[00:24:05.228 --> 00:24:12.895]  I'm seeing major cracks in the dam of their censorship, and the truth is starting to surge forward.
[00:24:12.895 --> 00:24:16.638]  And once the dam breaks, they're not going to be able to put it back together again.
[00:24:16.638 --> 00:24:20.482]  When the levee breaks, have no place to stay.
[00:24:20.482 --> 00:24:24.546]  Going down, going down, going down now.
[00:24:24.546 --> 00:24:27.748]  Let's come in with that, come back from break.
[00:24:27.748 --> 00:24:30.711]  So, let's play a few clips here.
[00:24:32.515 --> 00:24:35.956]  Ray getting really taken to the woodshed here it is.
[00:24:35.956 --> 00:24:39.337]  Can you define what disinformation is?
[00:24:39.337 --> 00:24:43.258]  What I can tell you is that our focus is not on disinformation, broadly speaking.
[00:24:43.258 --> 00:24:43.798]  Well, wait a minute.
[00:24:43.798 --> 00:24:44.278]  Yes it is.
[00:24:44.278 --> 00:24:44.698]  Wait a minute.
[00:24:44.698 --> 00:24:45.819]  Can I answer the question?
[00:24:45.819 --> 00:24:46.539]  You can in a minute.
[00:24:46.539 --> 00:24:52.760]  Your star witness said in the litigation, Elvis Chan who's in charge of this, said they do it on the basis of disinformation.
[00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:54.441]  We need a definition of what that is.
[00:24:55.293 --> 00:25:06.160]  Our focus is on malign foreign disinformation, that is, foreign hostile actors who engage in covert efforts to abuse our social media platforms, which is something that is not...
[00:25:26.193 --> 00:25:27.414]  Yeah, right.
[00:25:27.414 --> 00:25:30.335]  So, remember, Donald Trump's a Russian agent.
[00:25:30.335 --> 00:25:34.537]  No, the Democratic Party are globalist agents who've sold us out to everybody.
[00:25:34.537 --> 00:25:37.138]  And the Russians are amateurs at the trough.
[00:25:37.138 --> 00:25:42.581]  Hollywood, the left, the Soros crowd, the big banks have first dibs on raping us.
[00:25:42.581 --> 00:25:45.722]  Then the chi-coms get second dibs on raping us.
[00:25:45.722 --> 00:25:49.444]  Then all the other criminal gangs and mafias get fourth dibs on raping us.
[00:25:51.315 --> 00:25:56.638]  And all the medical centers get to brainwash kids and take them away from their parents and cut their genitals off?
[00:25:56.638 --> 00:26:00.479]  I mean, this country is a shooting gallery for the American people.
[00:26:00.479 --> 00:26:03.861]  Open season on our asses!
[00:26:03.861 --> 00:26:08.563]  He just went, well, we only block foreign disinformation!
[00:26:08.563 --> 00:26:11.765]  B-b-b-b-bolder dash!
[00:26:11.765 --> 00:26:13.505]  Go back to this liar!
[00:26:13.505 --> 00:26:14.666]  We need a definition of what that is.
[00:26:15.535 --> 00:26:27.601]  Our focus is on malign foreign disinformation, that is, foreign hostile actors who engage in covert efforts to abuse our social media platforms, which is something that is not seriously in dispute.
[00:26:27.601 --> 00:26:28.802]  I have to stop you for a time.
[00:26:28.802 --> 00:26:29.843]  That's not accurate.
[00:26:29.843 --> 00:26:32.944]  You need to read this court opinion because you're in charge of enforcing it.
[00:26:32.944 --> 00:26:33.865]  And then, July 4th.
[00:26:34.585 --> 00:26:40.587]  We had this explosive, explosive 155-page opinion from a federal court in my home state of Louisiana.
[00:26:40.587 --> 00:26:51.352]  It explains in detail that the FBI has been directly involved in what the court says is, quote, arguably, the most massive attack against free speech in United States history.
[00:26:51.932 --> 00:27:01.534]  The court ordered the White House, DOJ, and FBI, among others, to immediately cease colluding with and coercing social media companies to suppress American speech.
[00:27:01.534 --> 00:27:04.115]  Of course, conservative speech in particular.
[00:27:04.115 --> 00:27:05.695]  Director Wray, I find it stunning.
[00:27:05.695 --> 00:27:14.817]  You made no mention of this court opinion either in your opening statement today or in this lengthy 14-page report that you prepared on July 12th, which is eight days after the court ruling.
[00:27:14.817 --> 00:27:16.057]  Have you read the ruling, sir?
[00:27:17.612 --> 00:27:22.435]  I am familiar with the ruling and I've reviewed it with our Office of General Counsel.
[00:27:22.435 --> 00:27:27.458]  Are you deeply disturbed by what they've told you about the ruling, if you haven't read it yourself?
[00:27:27.458 --> 00:27:31.080]  Obviously, we're going to comply with the court's order, the court's preliminary injunction.
[00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:36.563]  We sent out guidance to the field and the headquarters about how to do that.
[00:27:36.563 --> 00:27:43.306]  Needless to say, the injunction itself is the subject of ongoing litigation, and so I'll decline to comment further on it.
[00:27:43.306 --> 00:27:46.128]  Well, let me tell you what... You know what he's really thinking there, right?
[00:27:49.107 --> 00:27:53.670]  He's thinking, my higher-ups have told me and the black ops they're getting ready to cut the power and launch a bigger war.
[00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:55.031]  They can't do it soon enough.
[00:27:55.031 --> 00:27:55.971]  We've lost control.
[00:27:55.971 --> 00:27:56.772]  They know what we've done.
[00:27:56.772 --> 00:28:01.635]  We've got to go ahead and do a power outage and blame it on the domestic groups and start the terror attacks.
[00:28:01.635 --> 00:28:04.137]  We've got to go ahead and launch a civil war.
[00:28:04.137 --> 00:28:06.758]  He's just sitting there going, we've waited too long, we've waited too long.
[00:28:06.758 --> 00:28:08.640]  He's thinking, blow the truck bombs.
[00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:15.242]  Activate the sleeper cells, prepare to blame the American people, prepare the false flag.
[00:28:15.242 --> 00:28:30.547]  He's back at headquarters, you know, and then going off to some park somewhere and meeting with one of the spook heads and just saying, he'll probably meet with Brennan right now and Obama, and they're just sitting around going, we got to get the green light from the 300.
[00:28:30.547 --> 00:28:32.327]  We got to talk to the Rothschilds, Rockefellers.
[00:28:32.327 --> 00:28:33.968]  We got to get the big combines.
[00:28:33.968 --> 00:28:35.688]  They're like, well, don't you represent them?
[00:28:35.688 --> 00:28:37.469]  The director is the Carnegie director.
[00:28:38.234 --> 00:28:41.577]  And he's like, well, the director doesn't have full authorization from the board.
[00:28:41.577 --> 00:28:42.918]  It's too dangerous to launch these operations.
[00:28:42.918 --> 00:28:43.739]  The public's aware of them.
[00:28:43.739 --> 00:28:44.920]  Well, we better launch them fast.
[00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:46.201]  And they're having a debate right now.
[00:28:46.201 --> 00:28:47.482]  Setting off nukes, you name it.
[00:28:47.482 --> 00:28:48.103]  Sky's the limit.
[00:28:48.103 --> 00:28:48.864]  Bioweapons.
[00:28:48.864 --> 00:28:50.845]  They'll kill everybody to stay in power.
[00:28:50.845 --> 00:28:53.107]  I'm telling you, you want to, I'm telling you.
[00:28:53.107 --> 00:28:53.588]  We'll be right back.
[00:28:59.599 --> 00:29:09.231]  With all the craziness in the world, the collapsing borders, the war with Russia, the insanity, the currency devaluations, the economy going crazy.
[00:29:09.231 --> 00:29:14.538]  You are crazy, in my view, if you don't get high-quality, storable food and water filtration and self-defense.
[00:29:14.958 --> 00:29:16.639]  Now, we're not selling guns and ammo.
[00:29:16.639 --> 00:29:19.620]  That's for you to go out and get for yourself and learn how to use if you haven't.
[00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:21.261]  And I'm preaching the choir on that.
[00:29:21.261 --> 00:29:26.184]  But a lot of people got plenty of guns, but they don't have enough storable food or water filtration.
[00:29:26.184 --> 00:29:27.905]  This is something you need now.
[00:29:27.905 --> 00:29:32.487]  And we've got it in the food department and in the high quality water filtration department.
[00:29:32.487 --> 00:29:38.210]  The highest quality food, the best water filtration at the lowest prices you're going to find and still get quality.

[00:29:48.779 --> 00:29:50.080]  Our prices are already the lowest.
[00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:52.964]  At 10% off, it's an insane deal for a limited time.

[00:29:59.531 --> 00:30:05.778]  A lot of people have asked me, why is MFW Store and MFW Life not at a probiotic for more than 3 years?
[00:30:05.778 --> 00:30:06.999]  The answer is simple.
[00:30:06.999 --> 00:30:09.943]  We only bring you the highest quality at the lowest prices.
[00:30:09.943 --> 00:30:14.067]  We had a top maker, top certified of probiotics for more than 7 years.
[00:30:14.067 --> 00:30:19.493]  They got bought by a libtard company and said, we're not doing business with you Mr. Jones anymore.
[00:30:20.234 --> 00:30:25.739]  Finally, we've got a probiotic just as good or better with a top lab that loves our show.
[00:30:25.739 --> 00:30:30.203]  We're able to private label it under InfoWars MD as our probiotic formula.

[00:31:00.737 --> 00:31:11.369]  We have three original, one-of-a-kind toothpastes designed by my father, a dentist, at mFullerStore.com that don't have fillers, that are filled with high-quality essential oils, and more.
[00:31:11.369 --> 00:31:12.430]  We have a turmeric toothpaste,
[00:31:13.359 --> 00:31:25.970]  We have the Ultimate Tooth Whitening with Pearl Calcium Toothpaste, and we have the amazing Activated Charcoal Toothpaste, again, with a whole bunch of key essential oils that are so good, not just for your teeth and your gums, but your whole mouth, your throat, and more.
[00:31:25.970 --> 00:31:28.052]  These are really game-changing toothpastes.
[00:31:28.052 --> 00:31:29.373]  They're very, very strong.
[00:31:29.373 --> 00:31:31.475]  Most over-the-counter toothpastes have fluoride.
[00:31:31.475 --> 00:31:32.536]  Ours don't.
[00:31:32.536 --> 00:31:33.977]  And it doesn't have fillers in it.
[00:31:33.977 --> 00:31:35.579]  It is just chock-full.
[00:31:36.179 --> 00:31:39.922]  Of incredible things that God gave us through Mother Nature.
[00:31:39.922 --> 00:31:41.903]  So, it's now back in stock.
[00:31:41.903 --> 00:31:43.464]  It became a best-seller.
[00:31:43.464 --> 00:31:46.726]  The Turmeric Toothpaste is available again at Infolwerestore.com.
[00:31:46.726 --> 00:31:48.308]  We're selling out of the Tooth Whitening Toothpaste.
[00:31:48.308 --> 00:31:49.408]  We've got some of that left.
[00:31:49.408 --> 00:31:53.691]  And we also have some of the amazing Activated Charcoal Toothpaste in stock, but it's running out as well.
[00:31:53.691 --> 00:31:57.314]  So, all three toothpastes in stock for a limited time at Infolwerestore.com.
[00:31:59.651 --> 00:32:06.580]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil, which is at the foundation of our entire food supply.
[00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:15.571]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element, which has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population.
[00:32:15.571 --> 00:32:17.794]  And there are two things we need to do about it.
[00:32:18.414 --> 00:32:21.717]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[00:32:21.717 --> 00:32:30.223]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics that will naturally keep the soil rich with iodine.
[00:32:30.223 --> 00:32:40.070]  And we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day, derived from ancient sea salts found thousands of feet below the Earth's surface.
[00:32:40.630 --> 00:32:46.551]  Our InfoWars Life Survival Shield X3 is hands down the best.
[00:32:46.551 --> 00:32:52.613]  Pure nascent iodine, stabilized in an activated triiodine form.
[00:32:52.613 --> 00:33:00.895]  For a healthy thyroid and a healthy metabolism, get yours now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:33:00.895 --> 00:33:06.796]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:26.724 --> 00:33:38.453]  Let's put the live feed of Chris Wray, the New World Order hijacker of the FBI up there on screen for TV viewers here in a moment.
[00:33:38.453 --> 00:33:41.595]  And then we will continue on here.
[00:33:41.595 --> 00:33:46.699]  Got a lot of other news, a lot of different angles and things that I'm intending to hit and get into.
[00:33:46.699 --> 00:33:49.381]  Obviously here today I also intend to open the phones up.
[00:33:49.381 --> 00:33:51.403]  But when we went out to break and I was doing a
[00:33:53.852 --> 00:33:59.277]  Simulation of the type of things I believe they're talking about and I know they're talking about behind the scenes.
[00:33:59.277 --> 00:34:08.264]  The deep state, corrupt, corporate, global interests that have seized our nation and are basically swallowing it and dissolving it right now into tyranny.
[00:34:08.264 --> 00:34:12.928]  They in their own white papers and public statements admit they're losing control.
[00:34:13.993 --> 00:34:17.915]  And they admit they're all going to go to prison if President Trump gets back in.
[00:34:17.915 --> 00:34:39.848]  So when you realize that they are in control, more and more of the nuclear weapons that robots and computers are replacing the checks and balances that are humans, and you see all the wars they've started, all the crazy things they've done, and the fact that they released COVID out of a lab, they ordered the medical facilities not to give people known treatments to increase death levels,
[00:34:41.363 --> 00:34:46.528]  They paid hospitals $50,000-plus to intubate healthy people and kill them.
[00:34:46.528 --> 00:34:52.853]  They kicked families out of nursing homes but brought COVID patients in to get them sick and then kill them.
[00:34:52.853 --> 00:34:55.816]  They did this worldwide as a test.
[00:34:55.816 --> 00:35:00.080]  That's the Bill Gateses and Klaus Schwabs and the people above them.
[00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:08.107]  And so when they've already committed a massive, genocidal holocaust against the industrialized Western world,
[00:35:09.975 --> 00:35:12.636]  They didn't have COVID in Africa because the Africans said, we don't trust you.
[00:35:12.636 --> 00:35:15.177]  We're not, we're not going to take it.
[00:35:15.177 --> 00:35:17.718]  They had the lowest quote COVID rates in the world.
[00:35:17.718 --> 00:35:24.300]  A couple thousand deaths and only 6% ever tested positive because they didn't rig the machines to test positive.
[00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:29.082]  Remember the president of Tanzania as a scientist tested a papaya.
[00:35:30.455 --> 00:35:35.577]  Tested a goat that came up positive for COVID at the settings the UN told them to use.
[00:35:35.577 --> 00:35:40.418]  They just turned the settings up where this piece of paper here in my hand will say you've got COVID.
[00:35:40.418 --> 00:35:42.379]  Remember all that fraud?
[00:35:42.379 --> 00:35:50.761]  So I don't get up here to be sensational when I tell you the crazy people running things will do anything to stay in power.
[00:35:50.761 --> 00:35:53.382]  And they've been teeing up.
[00:35:53.382 --> 00:35:54.863]  And they've been hyping.
[00:35:54.863 --> 00:35:55.923]  And they've been pushing.
[00:35:57.472 --> 00:36:11.863]  That imminently, right-wingers, Trump supporters are going to attack the power grid via a cyber attack, that way they can frame people.
[00:36:11.863 --> 00:36:22.692]  And that once that happens, they're just going to have to put an internet kill switch in that only allows certain websites to be visited, approved media and government.
[00:36:23.797 --> 00:36:32.741]  And that they're going to have to round up and arrest the evil right-wingers that are planning a digital January 6th.
[00:36:32.741 --> 00:36:43.946]  Now, I predicted they would do this two years before they did it, looking at the FBI reports that we're putting out and the national directives that Obama was putting out through his puppet Biden.
[00:36:45.888 --> 00:36:56.917]  And I said, look for them to claim that right-wing MAGA groups are going to hack attack and bring down part of the power grid or large sections of the power grid.
[00:36:56.917 --> 00:37:01.501]  And that that'll be used for the new, basically, COVID lockdowns.
[00:37:01.501 --> 00:37:09.907]  And then they'll use that as the pretext for the Internet ID that once they turn the Internet back on, because they're going to say the Internet's being used to attack infrastructure.
[00:37:09.907 --> 00:37:12.709]  Once they turn it back on, you've got to have an Internet ID
[00:37:15.250 --> 00:37:19.192]  Which they're announcing all over the world right now to be able to get back on.
[00:37:19.192 --> 00:37:40.303]  And the people that don't get back on, sorry, you've got to scan to get into this grocery store, you've got to scan your smartphone to get gas, you've got to scan your smartphone to get on the internet, because you saw what happened when in, say, the Northeast, or the West Coast, or the Texas power sector, that's five states, or the Chicago system,
[00:37:42.990 --> 00:37:46.171]  One of the six grids, or maybe more, goes out.
[00:37:46.171 --> 00:37:47.292]  You saw the devastation.
[00:37:47.292 --> 00:37:49.673]  You saw the stock market crash.
[00:37:49.673 --> 00:37:50.413]  10,000 points.
[00:37:50.413 --> 00:37:51.434]  You saw the fear.
[00:37:51.434 --> 00:37:52.774]  You saw the riots.
[00:37:52.774 --> 00:38:06.601]  You saw two months of no power, and we bet the heroes, and the engineers, and the men and women of the law enforcement barely got it back up!
[00:38:06.601 --> 00:38:09.142]  And they've got the main hacker, a Trump supporter.
[00:38:10.609 --> 00:38:19.913]  Who admits he works with Russia, and he's confessed, he's confessed to running the attack that brought down one-third of the U.S.
[00:38:19.913 --> 00:38:23.655]  grid and killed one million people in the last two months with the riots and death.
[00:38:23.655 --> 00:38:38.822]  We've made it through it, we've come together as a country, but we've got to have this Internet ID, we've got to have the central bank digital currency, it's all just so have to be ready, and those that don't accept it are part of the group that did this, they're Russian agents.
[00:38:40.194 --> 00:38:40.975]  Breaking!
[00:38:40.975 --> 00:38:43.677]  Russians just used tactical nuclear weapons.
[00:38:43.677 --> 00:38:50.704]  NATO's now officially joining the war.
[00:38:50.704 --> 00:38:56.729]  That's how it's gonna go down.
[00:38:56.729 --> 00:38:58.611]  That's one major scenario.
[00:39:00.643 --> 00:39:03.424]  And that's the one they've been pre-programming the most.
[00:39:03.424 --> 00:39:09.625]  I knew their final pre-programming, like a jigsaw puzzle, that's got 400 pieces, about two years ago.
[00:39:09.625 --> 00:39:14.246]  Man, I've said it about 500 times, that exact scenario you just heard.
[00:39:14.246 --> 00:39:23.828]  And I said, you know they're getting ready to do it when they say, OK, right-wingers that support Trump are going to hack the Internet and hack infrastructure and bring down the power grid for Russia.
[00:39:23.828 --> 00:39:28.149]  And so we've got to, you know, get ready to, quote, turn the Internet off.
[00:39:29.119 --> 00:39:31.460]  So that they can't use it to shut things down.
[00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:33.741]  But who's really shutting down the Keystone Pipeline?
[00:39:33.741 --> 00:39:35.802]  Who's really blowing up the Nord Stream Pipeline?
[00:39:35.802 --> 00:39:39.784]  Who's blowing up the Russian Pipelines, the European Pipelines, our pipelines?
[00:39:39.784 --> 00:39:41.405]  Who's dissolving the borders?
[00:39:41.405 --> 00:39:44.647]  Who's shipping in the kidnapped children?
[00:39:44.647 --> 00:39:46.027]  Who's devaluing the dollar?
[00:39:46.027 --> 00:39:47.468]  Who's demoralizing the country?
[00:39:47.468 --> 00:39:48.849]  Who's giving us poison shots?
[00:39:50.407 --> 00:39:52.128]  Who's defunding the police?
[00:39:52.128 --> 00:40:04.534]  Who's letting radical, hardcore criminals, in many cases with no bail, people that rob banks are being let out with no bail in more than a hundred towns and cities, including Los Angeles?
[00:40:04.534 --> 00:40:05.655]  Who's doing all that?
[00:40:05.655 --> 00:40:15.800]  Is it Alex Jones and Tucker Carlson and Andrew Tate and Joe Rogan and Donald Trump and Dana White?
[00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:18.682]  You know, those Russian agents that love red, white, and blue and
[00:40:21.397 --> 00:40:22.798]  Ultimate fighting championships.
[00:40:22.798 --> 00:40:24.360]  Yeah, we're the ones you got to watch.
[00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:26.222]  We're the ones that don't want you to live well.
[00:40:26.222 --> 00:40:27.783]  We're the ones that want to cut your power.
[00:40:27.783 --> 00:40:30.325]  We're the ones that want to cut your son's penis off.
[00:40:30.325 --> 00:40:35.110]  Yeah, we're the ones that want to sexually... No, no, we're not the ones.
[00:40:35.110 --> 00:40:36.331]  We're the Americans.
[00:40:36.331 --> 00:40:37.132]  You're the Americans.
[00:40:38.254 --> 00:40:43.378]  We're not the ones putting a mentally ill man in a dress up there to tell you Bud Light's the greatest thing around.
[00:40:43.378 --> 00:40:55.348]  And just like Bud Light's now lost $30 billion and is the 14th beer in the country from number one, the New World Order is going to be a thousand times less popular than Anheuser-Busch when we're done with them.
[00:40:55.348 --> 00:41:04.415]  So, if Chris Wray and his handlers think their plan to cut the power and blame it on us is going to fly, if they think that duck's going to quack,
[00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:15.213]  If they think that dog's going to hunt, you're crazy enough to do it!
[00:41:15.213 --> 00:41:32.918]  And everybody needs to know, the minute they cut the power, they've got MS-13 and other cutout groups that will claim they're Antifa, but it's really assassin teams that are planning to kill myself, Trump, Tucker Carlson.
[00:41:32.918 --> 00:41:35.599]  They're going to kill Joe Rogan because he's not going to sell out to them.
[00:41:37.535 --> 00:41:42.317]  And anyone prominent Dana White's dead.
[00:41:42.317 --> 00:41:47.339]  But here's the deal, they can't kill all of us.
[00:41:47.339 --> 00:41:54.582]  But just remember, when they make this move, they're going to try to kill every major person.
[00:41:54.582 --> 00:41:56.703]  They've got names, they've got lists, they've got it all.
[00:41:56.703 --> 00:42:03.106]  Write down your local top talk show hosts that's fighting, got the number one ratings, just common sense person they know won't sell out during this.
[00:42:04.226 --> 00:42:06.628]  They know won't go along during this takeover.
[00:42:06.628 --> 00:42:09.431]  They're marked for death.
[00:42:09.431 --> 00:42:12.433]  And it'll all happen in one night.
[00:42:12.433 --> 00:42:14.395]  10,000 people's houses are going to get hit.
[00:42:14.395 --> 00:42:17.498]  And it's going to be right when the power goes off.
[00:42:17.498 --> 00:42:24.864]  The minute the power goes off, or the minute they say the Russians have hit Ukraine with a nuke, they're coming.
[00:42:28.809 --> 00:42:37.114]  Tellin' ya, better be lookin' over your shoulder, better be frosty, frosty the snowman.
[00:42:37.114 --> 00:42:41.597]  Because you're six is when they're gonna come.
[00:42:41.597 --> 00:42:47.580]  And you know, here's the thing about this.
[00:42:47.580 --> 00:42:55.145]  Once the hammer drops, they tried to pre-broke him, everybody, that, uh, you get back in the deep state,
[00:42:56.420 --> 00:42:59.606]  By, say, flying an airplane to the FBI headquarters.
[00:42:59.606 --> 00:43:00.788]  That is not what people should do.
[00:43:02.130 --> 00:43:29.020]  People should hit the streets and expose who really did this on every national news channel and any live event or any enemy transmission they put out anywhere telling us in their coup, this is a finalization of their total takeover coup, anybody telling you that they're trying to put their disinfo out, trying to then round up the next big phase, the next big tranche of individuals and take you to all the COVID camps they conveniently built.
[00:43:31.388 --> 00:43:35.217]  So that's where we are.
[00:43:35.217 --> 00:43:40.529]  And that's just one major scenario that they admit under COG and REC 84 and the rest of it.
[00:43:41.587 --> 00:43:45.648]  And I tell the military and I tell the police and I tell everybody, we don't want violence.
[00:43:45.648 --> 00:43:47.448]  We're not looking for offensive violence.
[00:43:47.448 --> 00:43:55.470]  But if the globalists cut the power and claim President Trump's a terrorist and has been killed or committed suicide or something, you know the hammer's been dropped.
[00:43:55.470 --> 00:44:07.313]  And if you comply with anything you're told to do, you will live in something that makes Communist China, if you even live, look like a paradise.
[00:44:07.313 --> 00:44:11.114]  And it won't matter how much you serve them and how much you lick their boots.
[00:44:12.913 --> 00:44:19.297]  If your family history is good Americans, you're going to a forced labor camp.
[00:44:19.297 --> 00:44:20.077]  Okay?
[00:44:20.077 --> 00:44:34.705]  These are evil, low-down, empty people that fundamentally hate this country and our Christian past, and fundamentally know that we've stood in the way of their world government for hundreds of years.
[00:44:34.705 --> 00:44:37.626]  And they are not going to stop until we're all dead.
[00:44:37.626 --> 00:44:42.069]  You need to understand that, because they're little men.
[00:44:43.578 --> 00:44:44.359]  They're pedophiles.
[00:44:44.359 --> 00:44:45.079]  They're scum.
[00:44:45.079 --> 00:44:46.160]  They're trash.
[00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:47.581]  And they know.
[00:44:47.581 --> 00:44:52.505]  And they need to defeat us and kill us to feel like they're finally strong.
[00:44:52.505 --> 00:44:53.726]  They don't want to live in harmony.
[00:44:53.726 --> 00:44:54.586]  They don't want prosperity.
[00:44:54.586 --> 00:44:54.947]  They want death.
[00:44:54.947 --> 00:44:55.267]  At the top.
[00:45:02.685 --> 00:45:04.586]  That's why they've legalized pedophilia at the border.
[00:45:04.586 --> 00:45:05.666]  It's why the border's wide open.
[00:45:05.666 --> 00:45:07.286]  It's why they're not doing DNA testing.
[00:45:07.286 --> 00:45:10.247]  It's why they're making fun of real movies about real events.
[00:45:10.247 --> 00:45:15.709]  They're saying, because at the top, folks, the government is totally gone.
[00:45:15.709 --> 00:45:18.249]  And totally arrogant.
[00:45:18.249 --> 00:45:21.270]  And we are ruled by scum like Barack Obama.
[00:45:21.270 --> 00:45:23.551]  And Biden and his pedophile crackhead kid.
[00:45:29.485 --> 00:45:30.586]  And that's what we've become.
[00:45:30.586 --> 00:45:32.788]  We killed 60 million babies and said they weren't human.
[00:45:32.788 --> 00:45:33.509]  Well, guess what?
[00:45:33.509 --> 00:45:37.013]  Then our rights don't exist either.
[00:45:37.013 --> 00:45:40.036]  There's a very good chance this is all going to get derailed.
[00:45:40.036 --> 00:45:42.098]  This is so crazy what the globalists are trying.
[00:45:42.098 --> 00:45:45.542]  There's large swaths of the power structure and the establishment.
[00:45:46.912 --> 00:45:47.392]  We're good to go.
[00:46:07.137 --> 00:46:08.518]  The neighbors know who you are.
[00:46:08.518 --> 00:46:10.099]  Everybody knows who you are.
[00:46:10.099 --> 00:46:12.200]  You're just surrounded by yes-men all over the place.
[00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:25.107]  The minute society goes down, the minute you think you're gonna get the patriots and wipe us out, you may get the Alex Joneses and the Donald Trumps of the world, but you're not gonna get everybody else.
[00:46:25.107 --> 00:46:28.829]  And for every Alex Jones, there's 10 million people right behind me.
[00:46:28.829 --> 00:46:31.551]  So, I know you're gonna lose.
[00:46:31.551 --> 00:46:32.551]  And I know you're going down.
[00:46:32.551 --> 00:46:33.132]  And I feel good.
[00:46:33.863 --> 00:46:37.104]  I can stand in front of God no matter what happens and say, I didn't back down.
[00:46:37.104 --> 00:46:38.004]  I didn't sell out to evil.
[00:46:38.004 --> 00:46:40.105]  I did the best job I could.
[00:46:40.105 --> 00:46:41.945]  We sure mobilized a lot of people.
[00:46:41.945 --> 00:46:46.327]  We're going to give them one hell of a run because God's watching.
[00:46:46.327 --> 00:46:47.147]  But this is it.
[00:46:47.147 --> 00:46:49.728]  There's no more years of this or decades of this.
[00:46:49.728 --> 00:46:54.049]  This is just going to go on and on and on with more corruption, more insanity.
[00:46:54.049 --> 00:46:56.350]  This thing is coming to fruit.
[00:46:56.350 --> 00:46:59.530]  It's rotting on the vine.
[00:46:59.530 --> 00:47:00.951]  Its expiration date is over.
[00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:04.981]  And it's on.
[00:47:04.981 --> 00:47:11.542]  Absolutely, totally, completely on.
[00:47:11.542 --> 00:47:21.005]  And there's a real awakening of just how bad we've gotten, just how far we've fallen, just how crazy the corruption has developed into.
[00:47:21.005 --> 00:47:24.726]  That now every major corporate channel other than Fox News is endorsing
[00:47:26.184 --> 00:47:35.786]  Child, child, child sex trafficking, child sex mutilation, and attacking movies that are on record with thousands of convictions and congressional testimony.
[00:47:35.786 --> 00:47:37.347]  I mean, they're totally certified.
[00:47:37.347 --> 00:47:38.547]  True story.
[00:47:38.547 --> 00:47:40.548]  A small snapshot of a much bigger story.
[00:47:40.548 --> 00:47:41.948]  And they're just saying, you know what?
[00:47:41.948 --> 00:47:44.409]  We're not going to DNA test or check the IDs of kids.
[00:47:44.409 --> 00:47:45.869]  We're just going to let whoever brings them in have them.
[00:47:48.083 --> 00:47:49.904]  We're not going to have a record of who they are, we find them dead.
[00:47:49.904 --> 00:47:53.285]  I mean, they're literally covering tracks while they do it.
[00:47:53.285 --> 00:48:03.109]  What Biden and Obama is doing at the border is like a criminal wearing a mask and gloves to come to your house and kill you.
[00:48:03.109 --> 00:48:09.671]  They're literally erasing the trail while the news tells you there's no child sex trafficking.
[00:48:09.671 --> 00:48:13.653]  I mean, it just goes on and on and on and on.
[00:48:14.952 --> 00:48:19.634]  And everybody better realize we're being positioned for total destruction.
[00:48:19.634 --> 00:48:22.516]  The New World Order doesn't want America to even exist in the future.
[00:48:22.516 --> 00:48:30.400]  We're being positioned for collapse and absorption into NATO.
[00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:35.762]  Let's go back to the hearing and see if a Republican or Democrat is talking right now to Chris Wray.
[00:48:35.762 --> 00:48:44.767]  ...passed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, among other critical gun violence provisions in that the legislation begins to address the problem
[00:48:45.157 --> 00:48:49.160]  I mean, it's just, again, everything they say is a lie.
[00:49:10.862 --> 00:49:14.527]  Oh, is the FBI harassing with the ATF small gun shops?
[00:49:14.527 --> 00:49:16.530]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:49:16.530 --> 00:49:18.532]  Oh, did you dot an I wrong or cross a T wrong?
[00:49:18.532 --> 00:49:23.659]  Oh, you're going to jail.
[00:49:23.659 --> 00:49:26.623]  You can always tell what the answer is going to be out of these guys.
[00:49:28.968 --> 00:49:30.608]  We'll continue on.
[00:49:30.608 --> 00:49:35.389]  You know, I get so mad watching these hearings that maybe I shouldn't be watching it until later.
[00:49:35.389 --> 00:49:46.152]  Just watch some of the clips because randomly tuning into what Democrats have to say and the nauseating answers that these government bureaucrats give is, well, it's that.
[00:49:46.152 --> 00:49:49.512]  It turns my stomach.
[00:49:49.512 --> 00:49:52.213]  Absolutely turns my stomach.
[00:49:52.213 --> 00:49:53.053]  But the good news is,
[00:49:54.201 --> 00:50:02.825]  Federal judge denies government motion to stay injunction in landmark free speech case.
[00:50:02.825 --> 00:50:04.786]  But it's a lot bigger than that.
[00:50:04.786 --> 00:50:20.394]  It's the government illegally, secretly, with intelligence agencies, interfaced with big tech and media, to surveil and then censor people and then sick the legacy, dinosaur, repeater, propaganda networks,
[00:50:24.660 --> 00:50:26.981]  Against the very people they're silencing.
[00:50:26.981 --> 00:50:30.643]  So they don't just surveil you and then silence you and debank you.
[00:50:30.643 --> 00:50:35.386]  They then lie about you in a unified field of propaganda being directed by U.S.
[00:50:35.386 --> 00:50:36.446]  intelligence agencies.
[00:50:36.446 --> 00:50:39.728]  Gee, who do I know they've done that to?
[00:50:39.728 --> 00:50:46.412]  There was two people that the Wall Street Journal admitted six years ago who were being targeted to beta test this to roll out against everyone.
[00:50:46.412 --> 00:50:48.773]  And it was Julian Assange and another guy.
[00:50:48.773 --> 00:50:49.813]  What was his name?
[00:50:52.796 --> 00:50:53.597]  I forget his name.
[00:50:53.597 --> 00:50:54.918]  He lives in Texas.
[00:50:54.918 --> 00:50:55.760]  He's a talk show host.
[00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:56.941]  Oh, it's Alex Jones.
[00:50:56.941 --> 00:50:57.502]  Oh, it's me!
[00:50:57.502 --> 00:51:04.031]  You know, we can play the clips of the CIA and Congress saying Alex Jones is evil and bad.
[00:51:04.031 --> 00:51:06.274]  They're not supposed to operate domestically.
[00:51:06.274 --> 00:51:07.295]  I'm evil and bad?
[00:51:09.986 --> 00:51:13.267]  Because I sit here and experience your criminal activity?
[00:51:13.267 --> 00:51:15.368]  And watch you child sex traffic?
[00:51:15.368 --> 00:51:17.589]  And watch you put dictators in?
[00:51:17.589 --> 00:51:19.090]  And watch you do all of this?
[00:51:19.090 --> 00:51:22.211]  And then we're supposed to just sit there and let you destroy us?
[00:51:22.211 --> 00:51:25.352]  And turn our power off?
[00:51:25.352 --> 00:51:29.153]  Let's go to a Congressman Republican talking to Ray, here it is.
[00:51:29.153 --> 00:51:35.176]  ...Rasleen Johnson had collected were mostly financial records and could easily have been corroborated as authentic.
[00:51:35.176 --> 00:51:37.857]  And by then, the FBI had the Hunter laptop.
[00:51:38.795 --> 00:51:41.177]  In its possession for over a year.
[00:51:41.177 --> 00:51:45.820]  So it knew the lucrative payments of the Bidens from corrupt and anti-American regimes were authentic.
[00:51:45.820 --> 00:51:53.026]  How on earth did the FBI empower an agent under investigation for potentially corrupt performance and abuse of FISA?
[00:51:53.894 --> 00:52:07.343]  In one politically-fraud investigation, a Democrat operative-driven case against President Trump to play a key role and to undermine a second politically-fraud investigation, a case against the Bidens.
[00:52:07.343 --> 00:52:08.884]  How's that possible?
[00:52:08.884 --> 00:52:12.147]  How can you allow that to occur in the Federal Bureau of Investigation?
[00:52:12.147 --> 00:52:16.049]  As my colleagues on the other side of the aisle say, the elite law enforcement agency of the United States.
[00:52:16.049 --> 00:52:16.590]  How does that occur?
[00:52:17.481 --> 00:52:22.284]  I can't at the moment discuss a pending personnel matter.
[00:52:22.284 --> 00:52:33.010]  I can tell you that every employee who in any way touched the Crossfire Hurricane matter has been referred to our Office of Professional Responsibility.
[00:52:33.010 --> 00:52:38.634]  Are you concerned about this activity by the FBI and what was communicated to the FISA Court?
[00:52:38.634 --> 00:52:40.495]  Does that concern you as the Director of the FBI?
[00:52:41.175 --> 00:52:52.926]  I consider the conduct that was described in the Durham Report as totally unacceptable and unrepresentative of what I see from the FBI every day and must never be allowed to happen again.
[00:52:52.926 --> 00:52:55.288]  There have never been consequences as a result.
[00:52:55.288 --> 00:52:58.291]  Mr. Auden, has he had consequences?
[00:52:58.291 --> 00:53:05.218]  Well, again, I can't speak to pending personnel matters, as you would perhaps remember from your own time in law enforcement.
[00:53:05.677 --> 00:53:16.202]  Because we were working closely with Mr. Durham, and I assigned agents to help him, at his request, we slowed down the administrative process to allow his investigation to complete itself.
[00:53:16.202 --> 00:53:20.184]  Now that it is complete, our personnel processes are very much ongoing.
[00:53:20.184 --> 00:53:34.352]  Well, I think it is more than troubling that under your watch, we see that this continued to occur, and you have Auten being, continued to be empowered after there was an investigation, and after there was an effort by the FBI to look into why he would go to the FISA court and give wrong information.
[00:53:35.029 --> 00:53:52.615]  I mean, the issue here has been wrapped up in a cloud of politics, but the fact is the American people deserve to know how the FISA Court is being abused, and how it's being abused against the former president, and against them, in light of the reports that we saw Mr. Johnson from Louisiana put forward that was in a court filing, in a court report.
[00:53:52.615 --> 00:53:54.976]  I want to move on to another topic.
[00:53:54.976 --> 00:54:00.958]  On September 23rd, 2022, 20 heavily armed agents stormed the home of Mark Hauk.
[00:54:00.958 --> 00:54:01.758]  You're familiar with this?
[00:54:03.103 --> 00:54:05.305]  I'm familiar with the Houck case a little bit, yes.
[00:54:05.305 --> 00:54:13.252]  And this was after Mr. Houck's lawyer reached out and said he would appear voluntarily because the incident in question occurred almost a year earlier in October of 2021.
[00:54:13.252 --> 00:54:15.754]  So a year earlier.
[00:54:15.754 --> 00:54:21.960]  And the question here I have, local authorities investigated the incident but concluded there was no case.
[00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:25.163]  After the jury met for roughly an hour, Houck was acquitted.
[00:54:25.163 --> 00:54:27.024]  How on earth did Mark Houck
[00:54:27.992 --> 00:54:34.795]  End up having the FBI send several armed agents along with local authorities to arrest him at gunpoint.
[00:54:34.795 --> 00:54:35.835]  And do you approve it?
[00:54:35.835 --> 00:54:38.196]  Did you approve of that?
[00:54:38.196 --> 00:54:40.797]  Well, let me start where you ended.
[00:54:40.797 --> 00:54:47.739]  Decisions about the manner of an arrest are not something that the FBI director approves.
[00:54:47.739 --> 00:54:51.801]  I defer to and rely on the judgment of the experienced career agent.
[00:54:51.801 --> 00:54:52.121]  That's enough.
[00:54:52.121 --> 00:54:53.121]  I can't listen to any more of this.
[00:54:53.121 --> 00:54:54.702]  We'll get you the highlights and go over it.
[00:54:55.529 --> 00:54:57.470]  I'm going to restart the show officially.
[00:54:57.470 --> 00:55:02.431]  I mean, it's been a powerful hour, but I'm going to restart the show officially when we come back.
[00:55:02.431 --> 00:55:07.853]  And I've got so much huge news that it's on days like this that I almost choke.
[00:55:07.853 --> 00:55:11.394]  I don't want to say it's choking, but I'm just like, it's insane.
[00:55:11.394 --> 00:55:17.056]  Wait till you see the climate change, carbon tax, world government, digital ID announcements they've made.
[00:55:17.056 --> 00:55:18.856]  Bloomberg, AP, all of it.
[00:55:18.856 --> 00:55:20.737]  Massive tyranny out in the open.
[00:55:20.737 --> 00:55:23.738]  Just staggering levels of control that are being rolled out.
[00:55:24.793 --> 00:55:28.935]  Then we've got the huge Zelensky attacking NATO developments.
[00:55:28.935 --> 00:55:32.137]  I've got a bunch on the Sound of Freedom.
[00:55:32.137 --> 00:55:33.978]  And listen to this.
[00:55:33.978 --> 00:55:41.942]  A Franklin, Tennessee man finds a cell phone at a pizza shop that leads to the arrest of a soccer coach who drugged and raped young children.
[00:55:41.942 --> 00:55:44.083]  I've got stacks of this.
[00:55:44.083 --> 00:55:47.345]  And then meanwhile, they're saying none of this exists on the news.
[00:55:47.345 --> 00:55:49.186]  Oh, Sound of Freedom, nothing's happening.
[00:55:49.186 --> 00:55:50.347]  Look at this one, CBS News.
[00:55:51.207 --> 00:55:57.828]  Catholic Church spent $10.6 million to lobby against legislation that would benefit victims of child sex abuse.
[00:55:57.828 --> 00:56:08.990]  So what you've had is hundreds of millions of dollars by all these different groups lobbying to sexualize children, like Disney does, and then silencing people that talk about it.
[00:56:08.990 --> 00:56:10.490]  It just goes on and on.
[00:56:10.490 --> 00:56:14.231]  So, that's a big stack.
[00:56:14.231 --> 00:56:17.072]  We've got a bunch of news on quantum computing.
[00:56:17.072 --> 00:56:18.692]  It's just amazing.
[00:56:19.935 --> 00:56:22.977]  I'm going to get focused.
[00:56:22.977 --> 00:56:24.358]  I just started playing Ray Clips at the start.
[00:56:24.358 --> 00:56:26.019]  It made me so mad I kind of went off on a jag.
[00:56:26.019 --> 00:56:29.421]  But that was good that I laid out scenarios I believe they're preparing.
[00:56:29.421 --> 00:56:32.043]  Doesn't mean they're going to pull them.
[00:56:32.043 --> 00:56:34.585]  In fact, I don't think they're preparing those scenarios.
[00:56:34.585 --> 00:56:35.765]  All the pieces are there.
[00:56:35.765 --> 00:56:36.986]  They've already set the stage.
[00:56:36.986 --> 00:56:39.468]  I predicted how they would do it, and now they've done it.
[00:56:39.468 --> 00:56:40.889]  Exactly word for word, as I said.
[00:56:40.889 --> 00:56:42.950]  So I'm just, I mean, I'm in the enemy's brain.
[00:56:45.771 --> 00:56:52.772]  I just hope they're smart enough to know that no permutation of any attacks they launch will work.
[00:56:52.772 --> 00:56:56.253]  And the bigger attacks they launch, the more it destroys them.
[00:56:56.253 --> 00:56:59.073]  But, yes, the more of us it destroys along with that.
[00:56:59.073 --> 00:57:01.274]  So, I do like living.
[00:57:01.274 --> 00:57:06.055]  I really am not looking forward to the next bioweapon they're going to release, and the new lockdowns and all of it.
[00:57:06.055 --> 00:57:08.475]  And that's just if we're lucky they're going to do that.
[00:57:08.475 --> 00:57:11.356]  And, I mean, are we going to sit here and take this forever, folks?
[00:57:11.356 --> 00:57:12.016]  We're going to break.
[00:57:13.004 --> 00:57:16.325]  Today is the last day for the July Super Sale.
[00:57:16.325 --> 00:57:24.149]  Up to 60% off to all Patriot Points, Nitric Boost, Super Female Vitality, Brain Force Plus, Brain Force Ultra.
[00:57:24.149 --> 00:57:26.490]  It's all there, and we need your funding to keep fighting.
[00:57:26.490 --> 00:57:28.391]  We'll never back down, but we could give out.
[00:57:28.391 --> 00:57:29.771]  So spread the article, spread the videos.
[00:57:29.771 --> 00:57:31.092]  I see you doing a great job.
[00:57:31.092 --> 00:57:32.132]  But also buy the products.
[00:57:32.132 --> 00:57:33.953]  They will empower you, they will enrich you.
[00:57:33.953 --> 00:57:34.794]  They're really amazing.
[00:57:34.794 --> 00:57:38.175]  And 10% off on water filtration and all the storable food.
[00:57:38.175 --> 00:57:42.017]  I think that's going to get extended for a week or so, but I would take advantage of that as well.
[00:57:42.537 --> 00:57:44.118]  Hour number two, straight ahead.
[00:57:44.118 --> 00:57:49.240]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:57:49.240 --> 00:57:51.421]  The globalists are only humans.
[00:57:51.421 --> 00:57:53.081]  Yeah, they have control of the central banks.
[00:57:53.081 --> 00:57:55.442]  They have a lot of power, but they can be defeated.
[00:57:55.442 --> 00:57:58.623]  But some of their operations are going to take decades to stop.
[00:57:58.623 --> 00:58:06.867]  But one thing you can do right now is take control of your body and your family's body by purifying the water that you drink and that you cook with.
[00:58:06.867 --> 00:58:10.448]  And you do it with the highest quality gravity-fed filter out there.
[00:58:10.448 --> 00:58:11.289]  This thing does 10,000 gallons.
[00:58:12.649 --> 00:58:15.371]  You can sit there and put hundreds of gallons through in a day.
[00:58:15.371 --> 00:58:19.935]  It purifies very quickly and it cuts out thousands of chemicals to non-detectable levels.
[00:58:19.935 --> 00:58:21.936]  This is what I use, which my family uses.
[00:58:21.936 --> 00:58:24.098]  It's the very best system out there for the lowest price.
[00:58:24.098 --> 00:58:26.880]  For a limited time, 10% off on top of that.
[00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:31.984]  Exclusively at InfowarStore.com on the Alexa Pure Water Filtration System.
[00:58:31.984 --> 00:58:35.607]  In stock and replacement filters for folks that need those in stock.
[00:58:35.607 --> 00:58:37.328]  Get it today and it funds the Infowar.
[00:58:37.668 --> 00:58:38.508]  Don't procrastinate.
[00:58:38.508 --> 00:58:45.492]  This is one of the main areas we can take control of our lives and stop the globalists from hitting us with poison that they allow in the water supply.
[00:58:45.492 --> 00:58:48.853]  In some cases, they add to the water supply like fluoride.
[00:58:48.853 --> 00:58:49.874]  You wanted to plug RainForce.
[00:58:49.874 --> 00:58:51.014]  Do you like RainForce?
[00:58:51.014 --> 00:58:53.555]  Yeah, so, my name is Ken Heckin-Ladley.
[00:58:53.555 --> 00:58:55.817]  How do I write all the books that I do?
[00:58:55.817 --> 00:59:02.099]  Four books with Dr. Judy Mykovitz, four books with Project Veritas Whistleblowers, and now two books with Alex Jones?
[00:59:02.099 --> 00:59:05.161]  That's because I use RainForce every day.
[00:59:05.501 --> 00:59:09.482]  What I always need is I always need some sort of boost in the morning.
[00:59:09.482 --> 00:59:13.423]  And so, you know, I try to exercise, eat well, take good vitamins.
[00:59:13.423 --> 00:59:19.004]  But the one thing that I have really found that makes a difference is brain force.
[00:59:19.004 --> 00:59:26.686]  I'll take brain force in the morning right before I go to my computer and I'm good for the next four or five hours writing a whole lot of stuff.
[00:59:26.686 --> 00:59:32.348]  So it really is true that brain force is something I use every day and it helps me with my writing.
[00:59:32.808 --> 00:59:33.529]  Alright, we love you.
[00:59:33.529 --> 00:59:34.149]  We'll be right back.
[00:59:34.149 --> 00:59:39.193]  Get your BrainForce Plus, BrainForce Ultra, and TurboForce at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:59:39.193 --> 00:59:50.982]  We'll be right back with our number two.
[00:59:50.982 --> 00:59:56.867]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:02.182 --> 01:00:13.381]  Alright, I'm gonna hit it hard and start the next segment, but first, a clip of Andrew Tate talking about something really important dealing with COVID, and then a clip of where I predicted this all with Jesse Ventura more than 12 years ago.
[01:00:13.381 --> 01:00:14.022]  13 years ago, here it is.
[01:00:15.666 --> 01:00:29.539]  Why do you think support for the war in Ukraine, support for Ukraine's side in the war against Russia, support for a war against Russia in the West is kind of the bottom line issue for the people who run the U.S.
[01:00:29.539 --> 01:00:31.280]  government and for the American media?
[01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:31.520]  Why?
[01:00:32.341 --> 01:00:37.563]  I mean, I guess you could argue about it, but there isn't an argument about it in the United States.
[01:00:37.563 --> 01:00:42.506]  There's a position, and anyone who doesn't hold it is attacked and punished.
[01:00:42.506 --> 01:00:42.946]  Why?
[01:00:42.946 --> 01:00:44.266]  Why is that so important?
[01:00:44.266 --> 01:00:49.449]  Well, the first thing I think we should all do is I think we should all give Putin credit for curing COVID.
[01:00:49.449 --> 01:00:51.049]  Right?
[01:00:51.049 --> 01:00:53.751]  Because when his invasion happened, COVID went away.
[01:00:54.571 --> 01:00:55.572]  I haven't thought about that.
[01:00:55.572 --> 01:00:56.092]  Think about it.
[01:00:56.092 --> 01:00:57.813]  It's almost to the day.
[01:00:57.813 --> 01:01:00.174]  So we have to give him some credit, at least, for doing that.
[01:01:00.174 --> 01:01:03.837]  He may be the bad guy of the world, but at least he cured COVID for everybody nearly instantly.
[01:01:03.837 --> 01:01:04.537]  Fair.
[01:01:04.537 --> 01:01:05.257]  Thank you, President Putin.
[01:01:07.987 --> 01:01:13.449]  Yeah, I up until this point never really commented too heavily on politics.
[01:01:13.449 --> 01:01:14.110]  Yes.
[01:01:14.110 --> 01:01:20.032]  But I understand very well, I like to believe what's happening with Ukraine and Russia.
[01:01:20.032 --> 01:01:24.134]  And what I will say to the people who are watching this at home is that if you are
[01:01:25.134 --> 01:01:29.360]  Naive enough to believe that there are good guys and bad guys in wars.
[01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:31.462]  And it's as simple as good and bad.
[01:01:31.462 --> 01:01:36.229]  And that the bad guys are crazy, and the good guys want freedom.
[01:01:36.229 --> 01:01:38.932]  Then you need to do a little bit more investigation into what's really happening.
[01:01:38.932 --> 01:01:40.474]  And when you look at
[01:01:41.468 --> 01:01:44.091]  The vested interest of any country or any person.
[01:01:59.709 --> 01:02:11.377]  Jesse Ventura's conspiracy investigators have tracked down the deadly secret behind the elite group that tries to rule the world.
[01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:18.443]  When the population gets too big to handle, the solution is cut it down.
[01:02:18.443 --> 01:02:27.247]  There's an entire agenda afoot to force the population to undergo different type of medical treatments, namely vaccines.
[01:02:27.247 --> 01:02:34.871]  We're seeing a medical tyranny being set up, not just in the United States, but worldwide under the UN and the World Health Organization.
[01:02:34.991 --> 01:02:39.936]  They want a planetary dictatorship so they can carry out their foresty population agenda.
[01:02:39.936 --> 01:02:42.038]  And they want to do it through the medical system.
[01:02:42.038 --> 01:02:44.600]  And that's why vaccines are so important.
[01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:48.904]  We know that many of these vaccines turn out to have serious adverse reactions.
[01:02:48.904 --> 01:02:50.646]  This is being done by design.
[01:02:50.646 --> 01:02:53.008]  They kill you slowly over time.
[01:02:53.008 --> 01:02:54.530]  That's why they're called soft kill.
[01:02:54.910 --> 01:03:06.059]  We must acknowledge that the genetic COVID-19 genetic injections cause far more harm than good and provide zero benefit relative to risk.
[01:03:06.059 --> 01:03:15.447]  The death rates from this vaccine are, there's been more deaths in eight months than in all the billions of vaccines combined over the last 30 years.
[01:03:15.447 --> 01:03:17.249]  50% of the deaths occur within 48 hours, 80% within a week.
[01:03:19.150 --> 01:03:23.294]  And I've got an insider I think you should really talk to, Dr. Rima Labo.
[01:03:23.294 --> 01:03:36.126]  In a very short time, not today, not tomorrow, but very soon, we'll be facing compulsory vaccination under the mistaken term of voluntary vaccination.
[01:03:36.126 --> 01:03:38.448]  Now, what is it about these vaccinations?
[01:03:38.448 --> 01:03:39.489]  You think that they're bad?
[01:03:40.009 --> 01:03:49.635]  Well, first of all, let's start with the fact that the World Health Organization has decided that we have 90% too many people.
[01:03:49.635 --> 01:03:57.781]  The World Health Organization has been working since 1974 on vaccines to create permanent sterility.
[01:03:58.341 --> 01:04:00.082]  Now, this is pretty shocking.
[01:04:00.082 --> 01:04:02.604]  This process has already been ongoing.
[01:04:02.604 --> 01:04:12.649]  To make matters worse, the vaccines that were illegally approved by the FDA contain a substance called squalene.
[01:04:12.649 --> 01:04:20.493]  Squalene, an organic compound used in vaccines to stimulate the immune system and increase the response.
[01:04:20.493 --> 01:04:25.176]  If I inject you with squalene, you're immune.
[01:04:25.176 --> 01:04:27.317]  Now, the oil squalene
[01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:35.906]  Is nothing compared to the new nanotech oils that do it, but about a thousand times worse that they added to these shots.
[01:04:35.906 --> 01:04:38.208]  That's why I say it's a chemical biological weapon.
[01:04:38.208 --> 01:04:53.560]  It's got a nanotech self-replicating HIV spike protein, but it also has these nanolipid particles that do the exact same thing squalene does, but a much smaller amount does it.
[01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:55.201]  Devastating attack.
[01:04:55.201 --> 01:04:57.123]  And they all knew exactly what they were doing.
[01:05:00.179 --> 01:05:09.813]  With all the craziness in the world, the collapsing borders, the war with Russia, the insanity, the currency devaluations, the economy going crazy.
[01:05:09.813 --> 01:05:15.121]  You are crazy in my view if you don't get high quality storable food and water filtration and self-defense.
[01:05:15.541 --> 01:05:17.222]  Now, we're not selling guns and ammo.
[01:05:17.222 --> 01:05:20.203]  That's for you to go out and get for yourself and learn how to use if you haven't.
[01:05:20.203 --> 01:05:21.844]  And I'm preaching the choir on that.
[01:05:21.844 --> 01:05:26.766]  But a lot of people got plenty of guns, but they don't have enough storable food or water filtration.
[01:05:26.766 --> 01:05:28.486]  This is something you need now.
[01:05:28.486 --> 01:05:33.068]  And we've got it in the food department and in the high quality water filtration department.
[01:05:33.068 --> 01:05:38.790]  The highest quality food, the best water filtration at the lowest prices you're going to find and still get quality.
[01:05:38.790 --> 01:05:44.953]  Infowarsstore.com is running a special right now for 10% off on all storable food and on water.
[01:05:45.753 --> 01:05:49.356]  Ladies and gentlemen, you cannot beat this deal.
[01:05:49.356 --> 01:05:50.657]  Our prices are already the lowest.
[01:05:50.657 --> 01:05:53.540]  At 10% off, it's an insane deal for a limited time.
[01:05:53.540 --> 01:06:01.166]  Go to nfowarstore.com and get prepared while you still can.
[01:06:01.166 --> 01:06:05.329]  We are here today to tell you.
[01:06:05.329 --> 01:06:06.950]  You picked this fight.
[01:06:06.950 --> 01:06:08.812]  You wanted this fight.
[01:06:08.812 --> 01:06:10.553]  Well, guess what?
[01:06:10.553 --> 01:06:12.355]  You've got it.
[01:06:12.355 --> 01:06:13.716]  Let's fight.
[01:06:15.032 --> 01:06:20.036]  It's 11.59 at Radio Free America, and this is Uncle Sam with music and the truth until dawn.
[01:06:20.036 --> 01:06:24.299]  Right now, I've got a few words for some of our brothers and sisters in the occupied zone.
[01:06:24.299 --> 01:06:26.360]  The chair is against the wall.
[01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:28.562]  The chair is against the wall.
[01:06:28.562 --> 01:06:30.704]  John has a long mustache.
[01:06:30.704 --> 01:06:32.405]  John has a long mustache.
[01:06:32.405 --> 01:06:33.886]  It's 12 o'clock, Americans.
[01:06:33.886 --> 01:06:35.207]  Another day closer to victory.
[01:06:35.207 --> 01:06:39.510]  And for all of you out there on or behind the lines, this is your song.
[01:06:43.183 --> 01:06:50.130]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[01:06:50.130 --> 01:06:54.434]  You better believe you got one!
[01:06:54.434 --> 01:06:59.680]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:07:10.775 --> 01:07:12.176]  We are back live.
[01:07:12.176 --> 01:07:14.357]  We are broadcasting worldwide.
[01:07:14.357 --> 01:07:15.497]  We are the InfoWar.
[01:07:15.497 --> 01:07:19.980]  All right.
[01:07:19.980 --> 01:07:29.364]  I'm going to open the phones up at the bottom of the hour, give the number up, and I'll intersperse more news, but now let me tell you what I'm getting into.
[01:07:29.364 --> 01:07:32.026]  Huge new developments in the Sound of Freedom and the Enemies
[01:07:33.306 --> 01:07:38.589]  Insane, hysterical attack on it that blew up huge in their face.
[01:07:38.589 --> 01:07:54.457]  I mean, if you think the Dylan Mulvaney thing, sinking Anheuser-Busch and then leading to the sinking of Target and the sinking of all these other globalist pedo-supporting operations, this sound of freedom jumping the shark is bigger, mark my words, than the Dylan Mulvaney.
[01:07:55.407 --> 01:08:05.053]  That's what's so beautiful about this, is the enemy is just destroying themselves because they've been in power so long, they launched their major offensives, they metastasized their operations.
[01:08:05.053 --> 01:08:10.316]  This was supposed to be their glorious takeover, their glorious offensive.
[01:08:10.316 --> 01:08:23.364]  But it's running into a steel wall of people like you and I, who aren't backing down and who've built our own media systems in the face of government, CIA, Justice Department harassment, and criminal bombardment.
[01:08:24.767 --> 01:08:25.707]  We knew it was a war.
[01:08:25.707 --> 01:08:27.547]  And they kept saying, do you want more?
[01:08:27.547 --> 01:08:28.528]  Do you want more lawsuits?
[01:08:28.528 --> 01:08:29.148]  More attacks?
[01:08:29.148 --> 01:08:30.008]  More indictments?
[01:08:30.008 --> 01:08:33.989]  And we're just like, we're not, we cannot support you kidnapping and murdering children.
[01:08:33.989 --> 01:08:34.629]  And raping them.
[01:08:34.629 --> 01:08:36.549]  Yeah, we have to fight you.
[01:08:36.549 --> 01:08:38.069]  We're going to fight you in the information war.
[01:08:38.069 --> 01:08:42.290]  We're going to fight you economically, culturally, and of course, try to take us to FEMA camps.
[01:08:42.290 --> 01:08:46.991]  We'll defend ourselves, but 9% of war is informational.
[01:08:46.991 --> 01:08:51.332]  So anybody out there shooting their mouth off saying you can't wait for violence is a fool.
[01:08:51.332 --> 01:08:53.332]  We will win this in the information war.
[01:08:55.216 --> 01:08:56.076]  Which we've already done.
[01:08:56.076 --> 01:09:04.340]  And the enemy is now going to try violence because they're desperate and they think that's their only chance.
[01:09:04.340 --> 01:09:05.800]  They won't win with that either.
[01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:13.764]  And as much cellular satisfaction as I would get in a good fight with these guys, because they're going to turn and run real quick.
[01:09:15.151 --> 01:09:16.592]  That's not what we want to do.
[01:09:16.592 --> 01:09:21.537]  We want to continue to smoke them out and get them to manifest in front of everybody.
[01:09:21.537 --> 01:09:23.438]  Just keep giving them a rope.
[01:09:23.438 --> 01:09:29.684]  Like letting a big fish you got, when you first hook them, wait, you got them, now you know, let them run it out.
[01:09:29.684 --> 01:09:36.610]  When you got some 300 pound tuna on the line or some 500 pound marlin or thousand pound, you don't sit there and fight them right away.
[01:09:36.610 --> 01:09:40.594]  Let them run that metal leader all the way out.
[01:09:41.437 --> 01:09:43.759]  And then I start bringing them in.
[01:09:43.759 --> 01:09:45.060]  And they're already exhausted.
[01:09:45.060 --> 01:09:48.163]  So, we got them.
[01:09:48.163 --> 01:09:49.063]  We got them.
[01:09:49.063 --> 01:09:49.944]  We got them.
[01:09:49.944 --> 01:09:57.891]  So, the only question is when that big fish comes over the bow, when you haul it over the side of the boat, is it going to thrash around and kill us?
[01:09:57.891 --> 01:09:59.132]  It taught it.
[01:09:59.132 --> 01:10:00.593]  So, it's a serious situation.
[01:10:00.593 --> 01:10:01.834]  But one way or another, they're going down.
[01:10:04.707 --> 01:10:05.687]  The developments are insane.
[01:10:05.687 --> 01:10:20.751]  I've got a bunch of local newscasts and reports, not just here but around the world, of pedo rings being found, government people, school coaches, people that have power over children, drugging them and raping them.
[01:10:20.751 --> 01:10:22.731]  And the issue is we all know that's going on.
[01:10:22.731 --> 01:10:23.852]  We all know about sex trafficking.
[01:10:23.852 --> 01:10:28.613]  We all know just five, six years ago, Congress had hearings on it with Tim Ballard and others.
[01:10:29.628 --> 01:10:35.232]  And now you turn around and CNN says it's not going on.
[01:10:35.232 --> 01:10:38.135]  Rolling Stone says it's completely made up.
[01:10:38.135 --> 01:10:40.797]  These are convictions that Tim Ballard got.
[01:10:40.797 --> 01:10:43.719]  These are children he saved that were kidnapped for years.
[01:10:43.719 --> 01:10:46.541]  Just the cases they show in the movie.
[01:10:46.541 --> 01:10:51.385]  That's a snapshot of what one organization did.
[01:10:51.385 --> 01:10:53.026]  So I still just marvel.
[01:10:53.026 --> 01:10:54.887]  Because I've got enough stuff for 10 hours here.
[01:10:54.887 --> 01:10:58.250]  I'm not even getting into it because I can't get over what they're doing with Sound of Freedom.
[01:10:59.369 --> 01:11:09.278]  Now the number one movie in the country for five days running, getting bigger and bigger and bigger, and they're in absolute total panic mode over it.
[01:11:09.278 --> 01:11:15.723]  So first let's play a clip of him from a few days ago on Fox News, and he has confirmed for Monday.
[01:11:15.723 --> 01:11:18.406]  We got other folks coming on in the next few days.
[01:11:18.406 --> 01:11:21.728]  Here he is talking about how he's amazed that CNN
[01:11:23.487 --> 01:11:26.049]  Listen to this and have you respond.
[01:11:26.049 --> 01:11:28.131]  Films are created out of moral panics.
[01:11:28.131 --> 01:11:29.392]  They're created out of bogus statistics.
[01:11:50.672 --> 01:12:08.821]  And with something like Sound of Freedom, it specifically is looking at QAnon concepts of these child trafficking rings that are run by the high-level elites, and only people like Tim Ballard, and only people like Jim Caviezel, and by extension, only people like the ticket buyer, can help bring these trafficking rings down.
[01:12:08.821 --> 01:12:12.023]  Do you want to respond to that?
[01:12:12.023 --> 01:12:18.306]  Yeah, as that guy's talking, and he's nobody's hero by the way, I can't imagine any kid looking at him thinking he's going to help them out.
[01:12:20.586 --> 01:12:23.508]  I think of the children that are really depicted in that film.
[01:12:23.508 --> 01:12:24.709]  I know what happened to them.
[01:12:24.709 --> 01:12:28.471]  Those children were the subjects of child rape videos.
[01:12:28.471 --> 01:12:32.153]  Those children were being sold for sex.
[01:12:32.153 --> 01:12:39.558]  In total, you see over 120 kids actually are rescued in the story that's being depicted, even if the movie doesn't get into all of them.
[01:12:39.558 --> 01:12:41.019]  These are real kids.
[01:12:41.019 --> 01:12:41.539]  I see them.
[01:12:41.539 --> 01:12:42.920]  I'm still friends with them.
[01:12:42.920 --> 01:12:47.003]  So it's embarrassing and frankly grotesque for this guy who knows nothing
[01:12:47.483 --> 01:12:51.247]  Just start throwing out terms like QAnon and connecting it to a real story.
[01:12:51.247 --> 01:12:52.549]  I mean, they're not even thinking about it.
[01:12:52.549 --> 01:12:54.050]  So what are they thinking about?
[01:12:54.050 --> 01:12:56.993]  Are they thinking about starting pro-sex trafficking?
[01:12:56.993 --> 01:12:58.795]  It's so bizarre.
[01:12:58.795 --> 01:13:00.597]  It's like they're pro-sex trafficking.
[01:13:00.597 --> 01:13:01.839]  Like, leave the industry alone.
[01:13:04.321 --> 01:13:05.262]  That's how it feels to me.
[01:13:05.262 --> 01:13:07.644]  It feels like there's some other agenda, because why do this?
[01:13:07.644 --> 01:13:18.955]  There's that one scene in the movie where it's an older man and he's picking out what little boy or what little girl he wants to take into, you know, I just can't even talk about it, but to take away.
[01:13:18.955 --> 01:13:21.057]  We know what's going to happen to that child.
[01:13:21.057 --> 01:13:22.139]  Does that really happen?
[01:13:22.139 --> 01:13:23.220]  And how often does it happen?
[01:13:24.943 --> 01:13:28.526]  Well, this is happening all the time.
[01:13:28.526 --> 01:13:37.372]  There are six million children, believe it or not, according to the Department of Labor, Department of State, who are stuck in slavery of one kind or another.
[01:13:37.372 --> 01:13:39.794]  Either it's sex, labor, or organ harvesting.
[01:13:40.054 --> 01:13:48.421]  I mean, organ harvesting, we've been taking down several organ harvesting rings, where they take little babies and, you know, use them that way.
[01:13:48.421 --> 01:13:52.784]  And so we see everything, you know, and the film depicts every kind.
[01:13:52.784 --> 01:14:08.457]  Whether it's the lure, like you mentioned, that's a real person, that beauty queen who was recruiting kids as young as nine years old, and then... Now I want to go to the congressional testimony here in a moment, from now four years ago, but think about something here.
[01:14:11.036 --> 01:14:17.663]  I've met with federal agents and high-level federal officials in the courts.
[01:14:17.663 --> 01:14:19.665]  I mean, head people.
[01:14:19.665 --> 01:14:22.447]  And the numbers are all public and in their courts.
[01:14:22.447 --> 01:14:28.393]  So they said, this is public, we'd like you to get this to everybody, we'd like you to put it out, we'd like you to get Joe Rogan to put it out, we'd like you to give it to Tucker Carlson.
[01:14:28.393 --> 01:14:32.678]  Tucker got fired like two weeks later and was on the story.
[01:14:32.678 --> 01:14:34.720]  But not from me, he was getting it from all these people.
[01:14:35.956 --> 01:14:58.746]  And this is high-level federal officials, okay, saying, Mr. Jones, we have 30,000 children just in Texas in the last year, as young as six months old, that we catch with convicted pedophiles, and sometimes four, five, six convictions in Mexico, in the U.S.
[01:14:58.746 --> 01:15:04.429]  And the Attorney General of the United States will not let us charge them.
[01:15:04.429 --> 01:15:05.149]  And we have to let them go.
[01:15:06.451 --> 01:15:10.292]  And so, we're just talking to everybody who's prominent, what do you think we should do?
[01:15:10.292 --> 01:15:11.672]  And I'm like, well, you're the expert.
[01:15:11.672 --> 01:15:13.232]  They're like, well, here's all these cases.
[01:15:13.232 --> 01:15:15.133]  Our docket, our court is public.
[01:15:15.133 --> 01:15:17.633]  The magistrates, the judges are public.
[01:15:17.633 --> 01:15:19.833]  And we'd like you to look into this.
[01:15:19.833 --> 01:15:21.194]  Because this is human trafficking.
[01:15:21.194 --> 01:15:27.435]  And you see the congressional hearings, where they show the evidence and they point at Americans and they say, you are the biggest human smuggler right now in the world.
[01:15:27.435 --> 01:15:30.916]  I mean, this is bigger than the black slave trade at its peak worldwide.
[01:15:30.916 --> 01:15:32.036]  Which was terrible and horrible.
[01:15:32.036 --> 01:15:33.096]  But this is going on now.
[01:15:35.504 --> 01:15:36.905]  And they're making jokes about it.
[01:15:36.905 --> 01:15:37.986]  Like, that's indicative.
[01:15:37.986 --> 01:15:47.134]  That one clip of CNN they played, where, oh, this is just made-up statistics, and there's elites and child trafficking, and this is insane.
[01:15:47.134 --> 01:15:49.256]  Really, what's Jeffrey Epstein?
[01:15:49.256 --> 01:15:50.677]  And here's how the Democrats operate.
[01:15:50.677 --> 01:15:58.784]  Remember in the Sandy Hook show trial, the judge already said I was guilty that I'm attacking children for just simply questioning a shooting ten years ago?
[01:16:00.774 --> 01:16:08.017]  They say, Mr. Jones, you believe the government's involved in child trafficking with high-level officials, and I mean, you mean like the Clintons and Jeffrey Epstein?
[01:16:08.017 --> 01:16:09.858]  Remember that clip?
[01:16:09.858 --> 01:16:10.778]  That guy's fine then.
[01:16:10.778 --> 01:16:14.620]  Just a short little 30-second, then they cut Joe Rogan in going, whoa!
[01:16:14.620 --> 01:16:18.422]  And all the rest of it.
[01:16:18.422 --> 01:16:21.363]  And it got like 50 million views or whatever.
[01:16:21.363 --> 01:16:21.963]  Literally.
[01:16:21.963 --> 01:16:24.204]  Or more.
[01:16:24.204 --> 01:16:27.686]  But imagine being in a court, and that's the idea on the left.
[01:16:28.982 --> 01:16:29.062]  It's
[01:16:53.346 --> 01:16:56.948]  Literally getting thousands and thousands of children saved.
[01:16:56.948 --> 01:17:00.269]  His movie's only about a hundred or less.
[01:17:00.269 --> 01:17:01.610]  A snapshot.
[01:17:01.610 --> 01:17:02.631]  There's convictions.
[01:17:02.631 --> 01:17:03.811]  This happened.
[01:17:03.811 --> 01:17:06.312]  And the CNN is saying, oh, this is terrible.
[01:17:06.312 --> 01:17:07.333]  This is made up.
[01:17:07.333 --> 01:17:11.415]  These guys want to be your savior.
[01:17:11.415 --> 01:17:13.576]  I love how Ballard said, yeah, that guy doesn't look like he's going to save anybody.
[01:17:15.370 --> 01:17:18.672]  But remember, even the New York Times now admits massive sex slavery.
[01:17:18.672 --> 01:17:19.852]  Massive.
[01:17:19.852 --> 01:17:22.233]  And the organ harvesting is very real and has come out.
[01:17:22.233 --> 01:17:24.354]  It's been all over the news.
[01:17:24.354 --> 01:17:32.478]  So, who gives them the talking points on every major channel, except Fox, of corporate and mainstream, to say this isn't going on?
[01:17:32.478 --> 01:17:34.959]  Because everybody knows it was a big story until a few years ago.
[01:17:34.959 --> 01:17:38.521]  But now with Biden and all of it coming out, they're like, whoa, the public knows who we are.
[01:17:38.521 --> 01:17:39.681]  They know what's going on.
[01:17:39.681 --> 01:17:41.682]  Tell everybody to say this doesn't exist.
[01:17:41.682 --> 01:17:42.563]  Now it's taboo
[01:17:44.844 --> 01:17:48.186]  To talk about the open border and the kids being brought across.
[01:17:48.186 --> 01:17:51.749]  And 30,000 in just the last year in Texas.
[01:17:51.749 --> 01:17:59.094]  30,000 that they've apprehended with men.
[01:17:59.094 --> 01:18:06.159]  And 20,000 of the men they've apprehended and stopped, they're told to let go, have sex crime backgrounds.
[01:18:06.159 --> 01:18:07.780]  They were saying, here, check this docket case.
[01:18:07.780 --> 01:18:08.841]  Here's just one.
[01:18:08.841 --> 01:18:11.603]  And it was a man convicted five times
[01:18:14.380 --> 01:18:16.761]  From some Central American company, I forget.
[01:18:16.761 --> 01:18:27.923]  Back in the U.S., caught working in a South Texas town, driving a short bus for the mentally disabled children, raping them.
[01:18:27.923 --> 01:18:32.104]  And they're having trouble getting the Justice Department to green light prosecuting him.
[01:18:32.104 --> 01:18:34.145]  Let me say that again.
[01:18:34.145 --> 01:18:37.346]  And that case was handed over to us, and we're getting a report on it.
[01:18:37.346 --> 01:18:42.447]  I mean, imagine drinking through a fire hose of this, and then you turn on CNN, they say, this does not exist.
[01:18:43.595 --> 01:18:44.676]  This is not happening.
[01:18:44.676 --> 01:18:49.380]  Remember they told you Hunter Biden's laptop is not real.
[01:18:49.380 --> 01:18:53.124]  They knew full well it was real.
[01:18:53.124 --> 01:18:57.348]  Now imagine we have a federal government and a controlled corporate media at the top.
[01:19:00.293 --> 01:19:03.174]  It's only those few at the top and the media.
[01:19:03.174 --> 01:19:05.976]  They don't even have control of the courts in most cases now.
[01:19:05.976 --> 01:19:09.117]  Look at those federal judges, slapping down Obama.
[01:19:09.117 --> 01:19:16.861]  Saying, you're not allowed to surveil the American people, and then spy on them with the CIA, and then censor them.
[01:19:16.861 --> 01:19:23.484]  And then the FBI director goes, I don't know anything about that!
[01:19:23.484 --> 01:19:25.445]  They're caught red-handed.
[01:19:25.445 --> 01:19:27.046]  So, the government's not our enemy.
[01:19:28.422 --> 01:19:29.663]  There are a lot of good people on it.
[01:19:29.663 --> 01:19:33.787]  But the top group that's in control is because they are our enemy.
[01:19:33.787 --> 01:19:37.109]  They're coming after us.
[01:19:37.109 --> 01:19:39.211]  The good news is they're politically destroyed.
[01:19:39.211 --> 01:19:42.554]  Go ahead and go to Ballard.
[01:19:45.202 --> 01:19:48.323]  These children, the real children, have nobody.
[01:19:48.323 --> 01:19:48.803]  I know.
[01:19:48.803 --> 01:19:49.703]  I've seen them.
[01:19:49.703 --> 01:19:50.884]  I've seen dozens of them.
[01:19:50.884 --> 01:19:52.044]  They have nobody.
[01:19:52.044 --> 01:19:56.845]  The only adults in their lives want to sell them, traffic them, and rape them.
[01:19:56.845 --> 01:19:59.406]  And so we must run to them.
[01:19:59.406 --> 01:20:01.467]  We must be their parents.
[01:20:01.467 --> 01:20:02.107]  If not us, who?
[01:20:02.967 --> 01:20:10.570]  If not this esteemed committee with the power and authority to rescue lives, if not you, then I ask, who?
[01:20:10.570 --> 01:20:16.633]  Operation Underground Railroad has rescued over 2,000 victims and assisted in the arrest of over 1,000 traffickers and pedophiles.
[01:20:18.058 --> 01:20:21.481]  Much of my work has been based on simple economics.
[01:20:21.481 --> 01:20:27.465]  The United States is one of the highest, if not the highest, consumers of child pornography in the world.
[01:20:27.465 --> 01:20:30.467]  We are the demand for child sex.
[01:20:30.467 --> 01:20:38.414]  As such, traffickers around the world seek to bring children to the United States where they can sell them for sex and make a lot of money.
[01:20:38.414 --> 01:20:46.239]  My number one personal and professional goal has been to keep these children out of the hands of these sick American pedophiles.
[01:20:47.304 --> 01:20:51.006]  I want to share one case in which we failed to do this.
[01:20:51.006 --> 01:20:55.748]  The victim was a foreign-born child around 12 years old who we will call Lily.
[01:20:55.748 --> 01:20:57.629]  Lily was kidnapped south of the border.
[01:20:57.629 --> 01:21:09.774]  She was then taken along with several other children her age and smuggled into the United States not through a port of entry but rather through a part of the southern border without significant barriers or a wall.
[01:21:09.774 --> 01:21:13.196]  Lily's traffickers easily transported her to New York City where she
[01:21:14.196 --> 01:21:21.759]  was raped between 30 and 40 times a day and this is not atypical at all for a case like this.
[01:21:21.759 --> 01:21:31.002]  She believes that she alone was raped over 20,000 times between the age of 13 and 17 right here in our country.
[01:21:31.002 --> 01:21:38.645]  She eventually escaped and my foundation is now caring for her as she prepares to testify in federal court against her captors.
[01:21:38.645 --> 01:21:39.565]  In accordance with U.S.
[01:21:39.565 --> 01:21:41.046]  laws, Lily
[01:21:42.153 --> 01:21:48.535]  As a survivor of sex trafficking, she has been granted legal status and we're helping her to complete the process of becoming a U.S.
[01:21:48.535 --> 01:21:49.635]  citizen.
[01:21:49.635 --> 01:21:49.876]  The U.S.
[01:21:49.876 --> 01:21:57.258]  Attorney's Office has requested that we not publicly share any more details about this case as it's going to trial later this year.
[01:21:57.258 --> 01:22:03.160]  Recounting her experience, and this is key, Lily has often asked me a simple yet powerful question.
[01:22:03.160 --> 01:22:08.061]  Why was there no wall or barrier on the southern border for me?
[01:22:08.061 --> 01:22:09.602]  A barrier would have saved me.
[01:22:10.768 --> 01:22:12.550]  What is she talking about?
[01:22:12.550 --> 01:22:15.053]  It's pretty simple what she's talking about.
[01:22:15.053 --> 01:22:28.267]  I've been quite surprised of late to see politicians and others who are opposed to building barriers and walls, hail the successes of drug seizures and rescues at ports of entry, and using those successes to say, see, we don't need walls or barriers, we have ports of entry.
[01:22:28.267 --> 01:22:29.908]  The bad guys come through ports of entry.
[01:22:30.609 --> 01:22:35.031]  In fact, we don't have ports of entry without walls.
[01:22:35.031 --> 01:22:41.574]  The walls are the thing that compelled Buchanan to take that child into the port of entry in the first place.
[01:22:41.574 --> 01:22:50.118]  From his vantage point on the night of July 3rd, 2006, with this poor slave child captive in his van, he only had one choice.
[01:22:50.118 --> 01:22:51.819]  The port of entry.
[01:22:51.819 --> 01:22:55.581]  And that was thanks to the border wall that existed where he happened to be working his evil works.
[01:22:56.601 --> 01:23:00.743]  Currently, with hundreds of miles of border, too many traffickers have a choice.
[01:23:00.743 --> 01:23:04.445]  Sadly, we as a nation are providing them that choice.
[01:23:04.445 --> 01:23:08.427]  In the end, the boy was liberated and Buchanan was locked up.
[01:23:08.427 --> 01:23:14.470]  In Lily's case, the traffickers were liberated and she was locked up and raped thousands of times in New York City.
[01:23:14.470 --> 01:23:15.551]  The difference?
[01:23:15.551 --> 01:23:18.492]  The boy had a barrier to save him.
[01:23:18.492 --> 01:23:19.253]  Lily did not.
[01:23:20.478 --> 01:23:29.684]  Paula Felix is a former Mexican Congresswoman and current senior Mexican administration official working on anti-trafficking policies for Mexican President Manuel Lopez Obrador.
[01:23:29.684 --> 01:23:36.429]  I worked very closely with Paula to find children in Mexico who are en route to being smuggled into the United States.
[01:23:36.429 --> 01:23:40.092]  Responding to the debate over border barriers, Felix declared, quote,
[01:23:40.812 --> 01:23:52.300]  It is very disappointing to me that people in the United States would ignore or downplay the many Hispanic children being smuggled into the United States outside of legal ports of entry and forced into the hell of sex slavery.
[01:23:52.300 --> 01:23:58.865]  Mexican authorities have uncovered at least 19 different land-based smuggling routes where victims are taken and trafficked for sex in the United States.
[01:23:59.725 --> 01:24:01.848]  Downplaying the crisis discourages U.S.
[01:24:01.848 --> 01:24:07.898]  officials from employing every tactic available to rescue them during the small window of time that they can.
[01:24:07.898 --> 01:24:11.203]  That is, while they are being crossed into the United States.
[01:24:11.203 --> 01:24:12.945]  After that, they are gone.
[01:24:12.945 --> 01:24:13.606]  Maybe forever."
[01:24:13.606 --> 01:24:14.768]  End quote.
[01:24:15.829 --> 01:24:22.616]  As I conclude my remarks, please join me in a mental exercise that I employ often to ground me and focus me.
[01:24:22.616 --> 01:24:27.600]  I imagine that one of my own children is in the place of one of these child victims.
[01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:40.072]  I have nine children, including two that my wife and I recently adopted from Haiti after having liberated them from traffickers, so it's something easier for me to do, and I know it's a difficult thing to do, but please, just for a moment, please imagine that one of your children, your grandchildren,
[01:24:40.552 --> 01:24:44.453]  We don't know exactly how the traffickers plan to get your child in, in this hypothetical.
[01:24:44.453 --> 01:24:46.574]  That's up to them and only known by them.
[01:24:59.017 --> 01:25:11.304]  But I think it's important to remember the stats that we heard earlier today that upwards of 90% of the children, including the unaccompanied minors, are coming around the ports of entry in barrier-less parts of the border.
[01:25:11.304 --> 01:25:14.666]  But in this hypothetical, they're coming in, we don't know where, but they are coming.
[01:25:14.666 --> 01:25:16.807]  And in this hypothetical, before you sits a button.
[01:25:17.639 --> 01:25:24.182]  That if pushed, instantly creates a large and powerful barrier along the entire southern border.
[01:25:24.182 --> 01:25:36.847]  Now picture the hundreds of miles of border that exist, and picture those ports of entry with hundreds of agents, trained, equipped, looking for your child, trained to look for your child, who hopefully is coming through.
[01:25:36.847 --> 01:25:39.848]  And so now the question, do you push the button?
[01:25:41.707 --> 01:25:46.809]  If the answer is yes to that, then it's very clear what needs to be done next in our country.
[01:25:46.809 --> 01:25:49.930]  These children, the real children, have nobody.
[01:25:49.930 --> 01:25:50.411]  I know.
[01:25:50.411 --> 01:25:51.311]  I've seen them.
[01:25:51.311 --> 01:25:52.491]  I've seen dozens of them.
[01:25:52.491 --> 01:25:53.652]  They have nobody.
[01:25:53.652 --> 01:25:58.454]  The only adults in their lives want to sell them, traffic them, and rape them.
[01:25:58.454 --> 01:26:00.995]  And so we must run to them.
[01:26:00.995 --> 01:26:03.076]  We must be their parents.
[01:26:03.076 --> 01:26:03.716]  If not us, who?
[01:26:04.774 --> 01:26:07.216]  All right, very, very powerful testimony.
[01:26:07.216 --> 01:26:10.398]  I'm going to have it posted on Infowars.com, the live show feed.
[01:26:10.398 --> 01:26:12.840]  Now, that was four years ago.
[01:26:12.840 --> 01:26:17.783]  And Trump basically shut human trafficking down, 95% the Border Patrol estimated.
[01:26:17.783 --> 01:26:20.085]  Remember what Obama did?
[01:26:20.085 --> 01:26:23.627]  He said, if you're a child, you can come here.
[01:26:23.627 --> 01:26:26.970]  Also, if you're accompanied by an adult, well, that was a green light for all the human smugglers.
[01:26:28.860 --> 01:26:44.227]  But the Border Patrol got Trump to get regulations and funding in, that if you didn't have ID, you didn't have info, it didn't match, you look nothing like these people, you're two little girls or boys with some weird looking man, looks nothing like you, we're holding you for today, DNA test.
[01:26:44.227 --> 01:26:47.208]  And they can tell if you're a parent, a cousin, they can tell if you're related.
[01:26:48.692 --> 01:26:50.653]  One month ago, that was ended.
[01:26:50.653 --> 01:26:54.574]  That is, again, literally covering the tracks for the smugglers.
[01:26:54.574 --> 01:26:55.694]  I have nightmares about this.
[01:26:55.694 --> 01:27:06.058]  I mean, that means the federal government under Biden, the pedophile, literally is doing this and doesn't care that the rest of the law enforcement and courts all know.
[01:27:06.058 --> 01:27:07.418]  They think we're weak.
[01:27:07.418 --> 01:27:09.299]  They think this evil is going to go on forever.
[01:27:09.299 --> 01:27:10.499]  They think they're unstoppable.
[01:27:10.499 --> 01:27:11.199]  I got news for them.
[01:27:11.199 --> 01:27:13.360]  They have finally awakened the sleeping giant.
[01:27:15.032 --> 01:27:20.934]  Experts say ending DNA testing at the border will result in more suffering and exploitation.
[01:27:20.934 --> 01:27:22.395]  CBS News.
[01:27:22.395 --> 01:27:27.577]  Biden to end familial DNA testing at US-Mexico border.
[01:27:27.577 --> 01:27:34.979]  Biden-DOJ eliminates language on child sex trafficking from the government website and child victims of prostitution after losing track of 85,000 migrant children.
[01:27:36.716 --> 01:27:45.263]  Again, they let the children go and they give them to all these random, unaccredited Democrat Party charities.
[01:27:45.263 --> 01:27:46.705]  And we've been there many times.
[01:27:46.705 --> 01:27:51.789]  And what really hit me with the sound of freedom was the very first scene.
[01:27:51.789 --> 01:27:55.792]  And the first time I tried to go see it with my wife on Monday, was it Sunday?
[01:27:55.792 --> 01:27:56.253]  It was Sunday.
[01:27:58.197 --> 01:28:02.862]  She got so upset 30 minutes into it because it's really frightening and scary.
[01:28:02.862 --> 01:28:04.964]  And these are true stories.
[01:28:04.964 --> 01:28:12.652]  And anybody who's ever been in the store and you can't find your little kid and you freak out and have that panic, I mean this was like hard to watch.
[01:28:12.652 --> 01:28:18.238]  But they raid this pedophile, they get him, and they haven't saved one child that they watch in these videos getting raped.
[01:28:20.282 --> 01:28:21.825]  And there's thousands of them.
[01:28:21.825 --> 01:28:24.429]  These agents have seen thousands of videos, and he says, I can't do this anymore.
[01:28:24.429 --> 01:28:27.734]  He goes, I'm gonna kill myself, basically.
[01:28:27.734 --> 01:28:28.595]  I can't do it.
[01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.341]  And he says, OK, I understand, but that's the problem.
[01:28:34.341 --> 01:28:39.383]  Imagine being the judges and the federal agents watching Biden just turn the pedophiles loose.
[01:28:39.383 --> 01:28:41.905]  And then if you quit, they completely win.
[01:28:41.905 --> 01:28:44.806]  But if you stay on the job, you're actually aiding in a weird way.
[01:28:44.806 --> 01:28:45.806]  It's sick.
[01:28:45.806 --> 01:28:46.867]  And that's what evil does.
[01:28:46.867 --> 01:28:48.608]  It puts you in these sick positions.
[01:28:48.608 --> 01:28:50.729]  That's why they had the medical system give the poison shots.
[01:28:50.729 --> 01:28:51.929]  They didn't know what they were doing.
[01:28:51.929 --> 01:28:53.090]  Now they've corrupted them.
[01:28:53.090 --> 01:28:54.370]  Now they can blame them.
[01:28:54.370 --> 01:28:55.011]  See how it works.
[01:28:55.011 --> 01:28:55.471]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:58.851 --> 01:29:01.034]  The globalists are only humans.
[01:29:01.034 --> 01:29:05.038]  Yeah, they have control of the central banks, they have a lot of power, but they can be defeated.
[01:29:05.038 --> 01:29:08.242]  But some of their operations are going to take decades to stop.
[01:29:08.242 --> 01:29:15.991]  But one thing you can do right now is take control of your body and your family's body by purifying the water that you drink and that you cook with.
[01:29:16.471 --> 01:29:20.052]  And you do it with the highest quality gravity-fed filter out there.
[01:29:20.052 --> 01:29:22.273]  This thing does 10,000 gallons.
[01:29:22.273 --> 01:29:24.974]  You can sit there and put hundreds of gallons through in a day.
[01:29:24.974 --> 01:29:29.555]  It purifies very quickly and it cuts out thousands of chemicals to non-detectable levels.
[01:29:29.555 --> 01:29:31.556]  This is what I use, which my family uses.
[01:29:31.556 --> 01:29:33.696]  It's the very best system out there for the lowest price.
[01:29:33.696 --> 01:29:36.497]  For a limited time, 10% off on top of that.
[01:29:36.497 --> 01:29:41.579]  Exclusively at InfowarsStore.com on the Alexa Pure Water Filtration System.
[01:29:41.579 --> 01:29:44.800]  In stock and replacement filters for folks that need those in stock.
[01:29:45.180 --> 01:29:47.283]  Get it today and it foes the info war.
[01:29:47.283 --> 01:29:48.124]  Don't procrastinate.
[01:29:48.124 --> 01:29:55.114]  This is one of the main areas we can take control of our lives and stop the globalists from hitting us with poison that they allow in the water supply.
[01:29:55.114 --> 01:29:57.578]  In some cases they add the water supply like fluoride.
[01:29:58.786 --> 01:30:05.149]  The globalists aren't just targeting us through the poison shots or the electromagnetic 5G or the GMO crops.
[01:30:05.149 --> 01:30:11.571]  They're hitting us with hundreds of chemicals that the EPA has authorized companies and industry to use.
[01:30:11.571 --> 01:30:14.933]  One of the top pesticides used is atrazine.
[01:30:14.933 --> 01:30:24.097]  The allowable level the government admits that they allow to be in your water supply is enough to sterilize you and basically turn your son into a feminized mutant.
[01:30:24.097 --> 01:30:24.557]  Look it up.
[01:30:25.177 --> 01:30:26.537]  Don't let them do this to your family.
[01:30:26.537 --> 01:30:29.758]  We have the very best gravity-fed filter system out there.
[01:30:29.758 --> 01:30:32.899]  Highest rated at half the price of leading competitors.
[01:30:32.899 --> 01:30:35.219]  The Alexa Pure, ready to ship to you right now.
[01:30:35.219 --> 01:30:37.840]  We have replacement filters for folks who have already gotten it.
[01:30:37.840 --> 01:30:39.440]  It does 10,000 gallons before you replace them.
[01:30:39.440 --> 01:30:40.441]  It is amazing.
[01:30:40.441 --> 01:30:42.061]  It's great for your home, your business.
[01:30:42.061 --> 01:30:45.282]  You can put swamp water in it, tap water, well water.
[01:30:45.282 --> 01:30:46.702]  Almost everything is contaminated.
[01:30:46.702 --> 01:30:50.463]  This is how you take control of the fluids in your body and counter the globalist onslaught.
[01:30:50.783 --> 01:31:02.748]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[01:31:02.748 --> 01:31:05.069]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[01:31:05.069 --> 01:31:08.991]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[01:31:08.991 --> 01:31:12.933]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[01:31:14.366 --> 01:31:17.913]  They really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[01:31:17.913 --> 01:31:24.825]  And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week.
[01:31:24.825 --> 01:31:25.727]  It's really just incredible.
[01:31:26.730 --> 01:31:29.612]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[01:31:29.612 --> 01:31:36.155]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[01:31:36.155 --> 01:31:39.197]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[01:31:39.197 --> 01:31:46.260]  But most viewers and listeners, never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life.
[01:31:46.260 --> 01:31:47.441]  All at the same time, keep us on air.
[01:31:48.161 --> 01:31:52.442]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:31:52.442 --> 01:31:57.384]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWareStore.com, our funding problems will be over.
[01:31:57.384 --> 01:31:58.344]  Please take action now.
[01:31:58.344 --> 01:32:05.426]  In the early 1900s, certain companies were off-gassing highly toxic fluoride gases into the atmosphere.
[01:32:05.746 --> 01:32:08.569]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[01:32:08.569 --> 01:32:16.937]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers to convert these gases into fluorosilicic acid.
[01:32:16.937 --> 01:32:19.359]  Still highly toxic, but containable.
[01:32:19.359 --> 01:32:22.362]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison.
[01:32:22.662 --> 01:32:25.245]  And there was no affordable way to dispose of it.
[01:32:25.245 --> 01:32:33.653]  Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders was also the Secretary of the Treasury, who was responsible for the Public Health Service at the time.
[01:32:33.653 --> 01:32:35.494]  And by 1950, the U.S.
[01:32:35.494 --> 01:32:42.121]  government began buying this toxic, untreated industrial waste product and dumping it into our drinking water.
[01:32:42.581 --> 01:32:47.765]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease.
[01:32:47.765 --> 01:32:53.890]  With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water and a remedy to this madness.
[01:32:53.890 --> 01:33:01.016]  Available now at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:33:01.016 --> 01:33:06.901]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:19.767 --> 01:33:30.377]  Whether it's CNN, or the Washington Post, or Rolling Stone, they all tell you there's no such thing as government involved in child sex trafficking.
[01:33:30.377 --> 01:33:38.105]  Even though I've got a whole stack of news, and it's all over the place about Jeffrey Epstein, and the Clintons, and the CIA, and Mossad, and MI6.
[01:33:38.105 --> 01:33:39.987]  Why don't they want us talking about that?
[01:33:39.987 --> 01:33:42.169]  And why are they so upset about the sound of freedom?
[01:33:44.206 --> 01:33:48.307]  One of the things you've been talking about on your show is your allegation that government officials are aiding in pedophilia, child trafficking, and the grooming of children.
[01:33:48.307 --> 01:33:48.427]  Right?
[01:33:48.427 --> 01:33:48.787]  What do you mean?
[01:33:48.787 --> 01:33:49.828]  Like what Jeffrey Epstein did with his lungs?
[01:33:49.828 --> 01:34:03.712]  AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
[01:34:22.046 --> 01:34:24.529]  So let me finish up with this and give the number out and take your calls.
[01:34:26.237 --> 01:34:27.478]  Let me read this again.
[01:34:27.478 --> 01:34:40.185]  The Biden administration has stopped with children without IDs or IDs they can't confirm, holding them for a day and doing a DNA test to see if this is their parents, grandparents, brothers, sisters, cousins.
[01:34:40.185 --> 01:34:43.546]  It tells them 100% out to like four levels.
[01:34:43.546 --> 01:34:46.008]  Last study I saw, they got different.
[01:34:46.008 --> 01:34:47.929]  The tests get better all the time.
[01:34:47.929 --> 01:34:50.630]  They can tell if you're a fourth cousin of somebody.
[01:34:50.630 --> 01:34:51.631]  She's like, oh, that's my daughter.
[01:34:53.666 --> 01:34:57.708]  Paw Patrol's like, funny, I don't see any family resemblance, huh?
[01:34:57.708 --> 01:35:00.809]  Shows here you've been arrested five times smuggling kids before.
[01:35:00.809 --> 01:35:03.490]  Well, this one is my child.
[01:35:03.490 --> 01:35:16.155]  Well, the good news is it's a federal regulation that everybody coming through here that doesn't have IDs that match, we're going to keep you in a nice facility for a day, give you three meals, and we're going to see.
[01:35:16.155 --> 01:35:22.018]  Oh, hey, it turns out that you don't have any relation to this little girl or little boy.
[01:35:24.079 --> 01:35:29.121]  See, I mean, I could just sit here and just repeat this for like 10 hours on air.
[01:35:29.121 --> 01:35:36.683]  Biden just got rid of DNA testing of people with no IDs or improper records at the border with children.
[01:35:36.683 --> 01:35:46.466]  I mean, and Biden just took off the website, the federal websites of the Justice Department, child sex trafficking and exploitation of children.
[01:35:46.466 --> 01:35:48.127]  I mean, that's been a huge thing forever.
[01:35:48.127 --> 01:35:49.727]  We know this goes on.
[01:35:49.727 --> 01:35:52.288]  Again, it's like saying the Grand Canyon doesn't exist.
[01:35:54.096 --> 01:35:55.057]  Or Niagara Falls.
[01:35:55.057 --> 01:35:58.420]  I mean, it's just insane!
[01:35:58.420 --> 01:36:01.523]  Absolutely evil.
[01:36:01.523 --> 01:36:02.424]  So, flashback.
[01:36:02.424 --> 01:36:10.391]  The same MSM trashing Sound of Freedom as QAnon film praise Tim Ballard's Child Rescue ten years ago.
[01:36:13.646 --> 01:36:16.268]  Yeah, they just covered the stuff nine years ago.
[01:36:16.268 --> 01:36:19.291]  People said, well, why didn't Tim show it all?
[01:36:19.291 --> 01:36:20.512]  How do you do that in a movie?
[01:36:20.512 --> 01:36:22.674]  Stalin said, one man dies, it's a tragedy.
[01:36:22.674 --> 01:36:24.556]  10,000 dies is a statistic.
[01:36:24.556 --> 01:36:27.798]  I don't like Stalin, but what he said was true.
[01:36:27.798 --> 01:36:30.441]  If they try to, like, snapshot, then we save this kid, then we save that kid.
[01:36:30.441 --> 01:36:33.163]  It doesn't personalize it.
[01:36:33.163 --> 01:36:38.988]  Real-life Sound of Freedom hero, media-running interference for pedophiles and human traffickers is sick.
[01:36:38.988 --> 01:36:39.589]  Really, you think so?
[01:36:42.355 --> 01:36:49.542]  DOJ removes international sex trafficking of minors from website.
[01:36:49.542 --> 01:36:50.683]  40 million opening.
[01:36:50.683 --> 01:36:54.186]  Sound of Freedom breaks box office.
[01:36:54.186 --> 01:37:00.212]  UK government holds talks with BBC after presenter caught in child sexting scandal.
[01:37:00.212 --> 01:37:02.715]  MSM attacks Sound of Freedom.
[01:37:02.715 --> 01:37:03.736]  Says it's like brain worms.
[01:37:06.590 --> 01:37:07.570]  And it goes on and on.
[01:37:07.570 --> 01:37:12.671]  Oh, here it is back in the day, though, when CBS News and the rest were saying how good it was.
[01:37:12.671 --> 01:37:19.273]  Operation Underground Freedom, 6,000 traffic victims rescued.
[01:37:19.273 --> 01:37:23.574]  Rolling Stone again says it's brain worms.
[01:37:23.574 --> 01:37:27.355]  The Sound of Freedom is a superhero movie for dads with brain worms.
[01:37:27.355 --> 01:37:30.576]  Look at this guy.
[01:37:30.576 --> 01:37:32.616]  Wonder what's on his mind today.
[01:37:32.616 --> 01:37:35.377]  Looks like a really nice fella, doesn't he?
[01:37:36.578 --> 01:37:36.718]  I think?
[01:37:54.966 --> 01:37:56.287]  And it goes on and on.
[01:37:56.287 --> 01:37:58.870]  Let me show you a few older articles since they say this doesn't exist.
[01:37:58.870 --> 01:38:11.043]  In fact, play that clip from the kangaroo trial last year in Texas where the judge said I was guilty and said things I didn't do and said I had $400 million and would never let me put on a defense.
[01:38:12.090 --> 01:38:13.611]  Because I'd already been found guilty by the judge.
[01:38:13.611 --> 01:38:15.592]  You see, people say, why are your lawyers so horrible?
[01:38:15.592 --> 01:38:19.035]  They're not allowed to even say anything except in very narrow confines.
[01:38:19.035 --> 01:38:21.156]  Just enough to make it look like a trial.
[01:38:21.156 --> 01:38:23.237]  And I said to my lawyers, we shouldn't even be a part of this.
[01:38:23.237 --> 01:38:25.119]  We should just boycott this.
[01:38:25.119 --> 01:38:27.360]  They said, yeah, but the public doesn't understand you were defaulted.
[01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:28.661]  Now this is a fraud.
[01:38:28.661 --> 01:38:34.625]  We'll be able to get something in there, you know, with the parameters we're given.
[01:38:34.625 --> 01:38:38.568]  And so they felt so protected in this court that
[01:38:40.660 --> 01:38:41.961]  They would do things like this.
[01:38:41.961 --> 01:38:43.703]  Here it is.
[01:38:43.703 --> 01:38:48.788]  One of the things you've been talking about on your show is your allegation that government officials are aiding in pedophilia, child trafficking, and the grooming of children.
[01:38:48.788 --> 01:38:48.968]  Right?
[01:38:48.968 --> 01:38:49.348]  What do you mean?
[01:38:49.348 --> 01:38:50.509]  Like what Jeffrey Epstein did with Clinton's?
[01:38:50.509 --> 01:39:04.002]  AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
[01:39:16.254 --> 01:39:18.517]  Show, they've really done a good job over at Google.
[01:39:19.534 --> 01:39:21.955]  Expunging most of it, trying to cover it up.
[01:39:21.955 --> 01:39:33.160]  But if you just go in and type in UN sex crimes, UN sex trafficking, UN pedophilia, children found dead UN, you will still find thousands of articles, London Guardian, New York Times, you name it.
[01:39:33.160 --> 01:39:44.104]  Of course, you can also find the CIA with the German government, 30,000 plus children kidnapped, given to convicted pedophiles in Germany by the German government.
[01:39:44.104 --> 01:39:45.445]  Let's put a few of those on screen, guys.
[01:39:47.316 --> 01:39:57.838]  He'll show the New York Post, the New Yorker Magazine, excuse me, the New Yorker Magazine story, which I'm even surprised still the corporate media can report the truth.
[01:39:57.838 --> 01:40:12.341]  I mean, occasionally they're like, oh, look, the government kidnapped 30,000 children plus and gave them to convicted pedophiles and all this, and let them rape them to create a new culture in Germany starting in the 60s through the 90s.
[01:40:12.341 --> 01:40:16.762]  And one psychiatrist took tens of thousands of kids away, a government psychiatrist, and gave them to pedophiles.
[01:40:18.260 --> 01:40:22.203]  But see, now the new thing is, no, no, no, no, that doesn't exist.
[01:40:22.203 --> 01:40:23.545]  That's a conspiracy theory.
[01:40:23.545 --> 01:40:26.907]  Do not, does not, it's not even on the government website.
[01:40:26.907 --> 01:40:32.072]  There's no child exploitation, does not exist, no child labor.
[01:40:32.072 --> 01:40:34.534]  Forget the jungle, forget it all, doesn't happen.
[01:40:34.534 --> 01:40:37.837]  Bosnia, the United Nations, human trafficking and prostitution.
[01:40:44.317 --> 01:40:47.199]  $110,000 payout for sacked whistleblower that exposed the U.N.
[01:40:47.199 --> 01:40:49.341]  kidnapping and raping children.
[01:40:49.341 --> 01:40:55.806]  Catholic Church spent $10.6 million to lobby against legislation that would benefit victims of child sex abuse.
[01:40:55.806 --> 01:41:01.250]  The Finder, CIA ties to child sex cult obscured.
[01:41:01.250 --> 01:41:02.171]  More than 100 U.N.
[01:41:02.171 --> 01:41:04.193]  peacekeepers ran a child sex ring in Haiti.
[01:41:05.532 --> 01:41:06.493]  None were ever jailed.
[01:41:06.493 --> 01:41:07.914]  AP report.
[01:41:07.914 --> 01:41:10.216]  AP documents child sexual abuse by U.N.
[01:41:10.216 --> 01:41:16.042]  peacekeepers in Haiti, including Clinton Foundation officials convicted of kidnapping and smuggling children.
[01:41:16.042 --> 01:41:17.964]  Some used satanic rituals and murdered.
[01:41:19.517 --> 01:41:22.720]  AP Investigation, UN troops lured kids into Haiti's sex ring.
[01:41:22.720 --> 01:41:33.850]  And so what you want to know, when I'm being attacked or people are going after me, and you see the freak shows attacking us, I'm telling you folks, you can't swing a stick in the dark and not hit one of these people.
[01:41:33.850 --> 01:41:36.092]  They are emboldened, they are on the march.
[01:41:36.092 --> 01:41:43.238]  That's why so many Antifa, cops know, they get a search warrant to an Antifa member's house, they're going to find pedo-porn.
[01:41:43.238 --> 01:41:44.939]  Probably, they're producing it.
[01:41:45.785 --> 01:42:00.496]  In fact, every two days, not even looking or so, I see a news article, but a local one here, a local one there, where an Antifa member commits suicide after child porn and snuff films found on computer.
[01:42:00.496 --> 01:42:04.940]  I mean, so just so you know, you know how I know they're real?
[01:42:04.940 --> 01:42:12.706]  Not just all over the news, experience, witnessing them, going to the border, seeing them smuggle kids myself, seeing them hand over kids with no paperwork, they just disappear, little babies.
[01:42:17.042 --> 01:42:21.624]  Yeah, there's a Washington Post, Obama administration placed children with human traffickers, knowingly.
[01:42:21.624 --> 01:42:23.044]  Senate report.
[01:42:23.044 --> 01:42:27.026]  But see, that was seven years ago, back when there was some soul in the media.
[01:42:27.026 --> 01:42:29.707]  Now the big corporations own and control it all.
[01:42:29.707 --> 01:42:32.068]  Now, no, it doesn't exist.
[01:42:32.068 --> 01:42:33.729]  You saw CNN, you saw others.
[01:42:33.729 --> 01:42:39.351]  They said, this is not true, it's not happening, there is not child trafficking, period!
[01:42:39.351 --> 01:42:41.112]  We're the liberals.
[01:42:41.112 --> 01:42:43.793]  AP investigation, UN troops lured kids into Haiti's sex ring.
[01:42:45.234 --> 01:42:47.296]  Oxfam is tied to it all.
[01:42:47.296 --> 01:42:49.598]  Big UN charities.
[01:42:49.598 --> 01:42:50.379]  And they keep going on.
[01:42:50.379 --> 01:42:51.861]  Bosnia's sex slavery.
[01:42:51.861 --> 01:42:53.102]  You want me to keep going here?
[01:42:53.102 --> 01:42:54.823]  I'll be right back.
[01:42:54.823 --> 01:42:55.204]  Stay with us.
[01:42:58.703 --> 01:43:03.407]  Infowarsstore.com is like a grocery store, or like a vitamin shop.
[01:43:03.407 --> 01:43:05.369]  We want to have all the best brands for you.
[01:43:05.369 --> 01:43:07.431]  We want to have a bunch of different choices for you.
[01:43:07.431 --> 01:43:09.893]  So I get constant questions online and in person.
[01:43:09.893 --> 01:43:10.713]  Hey, what's better?
[01:43:10.713 --> 01:43:11.574]  Knockout?
[01:43:11.574 --> 01:43:12.915]  What's better?
[01:43:12.915 --> 01:43:13.656]  Down and out?
[01:43:13.656 --> 01:43:14.176]  What's better?
[01:43:14.176 --> 01:43:16.438]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[01:43:16.438 --> 01:43:21.383]  And the answer is, different herbal formulas, different compounds are better for different people.
[01:43:22.057 --> 01:43:26.021]  So, one person might like this coffee, another person likes that coffee.
[01:43:26.021 --> 01:43:27.342]  That's how our bodies work.
[01:43:27.342 --> 01:43:28.664]  They're all very diverse.
[01:43:28.664 --> 01:43:38.853]  But we've been able to private label a national bestseller that's been sold for many years that people love and sold for a lower price under the name InfoWarsMD Good Night's Sleep.

[01:43:58.598 --> 01:44:04.306]  Hydrofluorosilicic acid is the third most deadly acid on Earth.
[01:44:04.306 --> 01:44:06.990]  And they've got our children drinking that.
[01:44:06.990 --> 01:44:09.614]  This is a psychotic death cult.
[01:44:09.614 --> 01:44:10.355]  Period.
[01:44:10.355 --> 01:44:11.457]  Case closed.
[01:44:11.457 --> 01:44:12.819]  Out to get you and your family.
[01:44:12.819 --> 01:44:13.380]  We shall
[01:44:13.800 --> 01:44:21.089]  The Alexa Pure Breeze, made by the My Patriot Supply Ready Hour Group, that's been around about 15 years, became the biggest company in the last six.
[01:44:21.089 --> 01:44:28.659]  They went out, hired engineers, reverse engineered the fancy best water filter system out there that sells for twice the price, and they made it as good
[01:44:29.460 --> 01:44:33.842]  In all the studies, it reduces things to non-detectable levels, thousands of chemicals.
[01:44:33.842 --> 01:44:35.362]  But you can go pay two or three times.
[01:44:35.362 --> 01:44:38.183]  There's four or five other filters out there that are just as good.
[01:44:38.183 --> 01:44:43.405]  We sell the very best, highest-grade water filtration system for half the price of a leading competitor.
[01:44:43.405 --> 01:44:48.867]  And the media says we're bad and a cult for telling you you should filter your water.
[01:44:48.867 --> 01:44:50.527]  You should also filter your shower water.
[01:44:50.527 --> 01:44:52.088]  That's another way you absorb this crap.
[01:44:52.088 --> 01:44:53.648]  But I'm done talking about that.
[01:44:53.648 --> 01:44:56.049]  The point is, you can get the filters at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:44:56.049 --> 01:44:57.410]  They're discounted right now.
[01:44:57.410 --> 01:44:58.130]  Finally back in stock.
[01:45:03.874 --> 01:45:05.275]  I want to say brain force is great.
[01:45:05.275 --> 01:45:07.197]  I want to say turbo force is amazing.
[01:45:07.197 --> 01:45:07.798]  It is!
[01:45:07.798 --> 01:45:09.339]  But if you took it with fish oil...
[01:45:10.647 --> 01:45:12.669]  It's like the fish oil is it.
[01:45:12.669 --> 01:45:14.010]  The fish oil's better than it.
[01:45:14.010 --> 01:45:15.831]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[01:45:15.831 --> 01:45:18.313]  Fish oil is liquid energy.
[01:45:18.313 --> 01:45:19.954]  Brain, body, heart.
[01:45:19.954 --> 01:45:21.435]  The cleanest, the best out there.
[01:45:21.435 --> 01:45:22.916]  Krill oil is the best.
[01:45:22.916 --> 01:45:24.277]  And it'll give you the damn burps.
[01:45:24.277 --> 01:45:24.998]  And I'm sorry.
[01:45:24.998 --> 01:45:26.119]  You want something like this?
[01:45:26.119 --> 01:45:27.079]  You don't get stuff for free.
[01:45:27.079 --> 01:45:29.021]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[01:45:29.021 --> 01:45:29.621]  It's so good.
[01:45:29.621 --> 01:45:30.242]  In my view.
[01:45:30.242 --> 01:45:32.584]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[01:45:32.584 --> 01:45:35.286]  I ate five caplets of krill oil before I go to bed.
[01:45:35.286 --> 01:45:36.867]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[01:45:38.641 --> 01:45:46.146]  So, your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[01:45:46.146 --> 01:45:52.191]  So, we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[01:45:52.191 --> 01:45:52.951]  I just can't do it!
[01:45:58.410 --> 01:46:07.316]  Two amazing nootropics, that means brain power, are back in stock at InfoWarsTour.com, and they're both 50% off.
[01:46:07.316 --> 01:46:11.539]  We haven't offered these for 50% off since last Christmas.
[01:46:11.539 --> 01:46:15.541]  These are amazing products, and for those of you on the fence, I want you to try them.
[01:46:15.541 --> 01:46:20.345]  Brain Force Ultra hits in 15 minutes, only lasts three hours, with no hangover.
[01:46:20.345 --> 01:46:21.706]  It is a game changer.
[01:46:21.706 --> 01:46:23.487]  Nobody's got something close to this.
[01:46:23.487 --> 01:46:27.129]  Then, our Brain Force Plus is a good, basic, clean nootropic.
[01:46:27.129 --> 01:46:28.270]  It gives you four to six hours.
[01:46:28.510 --> 01:46:28.730]  I think so.
[01:47:00.885 --> 01:47:02.086]  Alright, here's what I want to do.
[01:47:22.313 --> 01:47:24.894]  There's blood on the streets, it's up to my ankles.
[01:47:24.894 --> 01:47:30.915]  There's blood in the streets, it's up to my ankles.
[01:47:30.915 --> 01:47:35.176]  There's blood in the streets, it's up to my knees.
[01:47:35.176 --> 01:47:38.397]  There's blood in the streets, the town of Chicago.
[01:47:38.397 --> 01:47:44.659]  Alright, I want to open the phones up, and I want to talk specifically about the Sound of Freedom.
[01:47:44.659 --> 01:47:45.339]  Have you seen it?
[01:47:46.991 --> 01:48:12.999]  When I just played that one CNN clip, because it's so nauseating, I've seen dozens of them, you have too, MSNBC, ABC, CBS, just saying, no, it's not true, they're exaggerating, there is no child trafficking, or it's not that bad, because they've totally opened the border up, and are just flooding it with children for slave labor, organ harvesting, sex, they're finding dead bodies of children, I mean, they'll open up a tractor trail, there'll be 40 dead bodies, 50 dead bodies,
[01:48:13.479 --> 01:48:17.580]  Just every day they find some dead toddler in a cornfield in South Texas.
[01:48:17.580 --> 01:48:24.963]  I mean, and then finally it comes out in court, but no media covers that the baby had been raped a hundred times.
[01:48:24.963 --> 01:48:32.165]  And you hear Ballard talking about some little girls that have been kidnapped being raped 30 times a day.
[01:48:32.165 --> 01:48:33.085]  The average is like 15.
[01:48:33.085 --> 01:48:42.228]  Embassy International found 80% of women and young girls being brought across the Texas-Mexico border are raped.
[01:48:45.626 --> 01:48:55.937]  But where is Robert Rodriguez when he makes a movie like Machete where the white people, Don Johnson, is down there shooting pregnant Hispanic women in the belly?
[01:48:55.937 --> 01:48:57.158]  No, it's not racial.
[01:48:57.158 --> 01:49:01.422]  Other than people, I guess, don't think Hispanics deserve the same support as other people.
[01:49:01.422 --> 01:49:02.704]  I think they deserve just as much.
[01:49:05.874 --> 01:49:09.877]  Oh, it's white people and black people and brown people, but it's elites, it's rich.
[01:49:09.877 --> 01:49:12.620]  Oh, there are some white guys raping little Hispanic girls.
[01:49:12.620 --> 01:49:16.483]  But see, Rodriguez doesn't make a show about that.
[01:49:16.483 --> 01:49:23.469]  He makes a show about Don Johnson going, I'm in the KKK and I'm gonna shoot a pregnant woman in the belly.
[01:49:23.469 --> 01:49:25.371]  That's not going on down there, other than the cartels.
[01:49:32.955 --> 01:49:45.500]  But, but, yeah, here it is, here's Don Johnson, an imaginary crime, an imaginary racial division, instead of humanizing white children, brown children, black children, yellow children, red children.
[01:49:45.500 --> 01:49:53.623]  Instead of humanizing and stopping the trafficking, no, no, they make keeping the trafficking going good to stop Don Johnson that wants to stop it.
[01:49:53.623 --> 01:49:57.845]  So there really are no guys in cowboy hats shooting pregnant Hispanic women on the stomach.
[01:49:57.845 --> 01:49:58.545]  That's not going on.
[01:50:00.615 --> 01:50:04.037]  I'm not saying the whole history of the crazy border, that hasn't happened once or twice.
[01:50:04.037 --> 01:50:07.680]  But the idea that this is going on on a routine basis is preposterous.
[01:50:07.680 --> 01:50:15.564]  What is going on is giant, massive human trafficking.
[01:50:15.564 --> 01:50:17.886]  And the media is covering it up.
[01:50:17.886 --> 01:50:22.489]  And that's why he's funded by Obama, and I have people that work for him that brag about it.
[01:50:22.489 --> 01:50:28.252]  His job was to create racial division, he was under the direct command of Obama.
[01:50:28.252 --> 01:50:28.833]  Where is he now?
[01:50:31.360 --> 01:50:32.720]  He knows exactly what he's doing.
[01:50:32.720 --> 01:50:37.462]  Robert Rodriguez is a shameful, disgusting person.
[01:50:37.462 --> 01:50:42.943]  Imagine if he made films about human trafficking and how we need to save these children and stop this.
[01:50:42.943 --> 01:50:47.085]  He could have saved hundreds of thousands of people's futures.
[01:50:47.085 --> 01:50:48.145]  Nope!
[01:50:48.145 --> 01:50:56.107]  Take money from Obama so he makes movies about white people in fantasy land murdering Hispanic women.
[01:50:56.107 --> 01:50:57.808]  So I'm going to take your calls on this.
[01:50:59.321 --> 01:51:00.281]  And where do you think this is going?
[01:51:00.281 --> 01:51:03.982]  But I believe it's going to be a slower burn, but a bigger explosion.
[01:51:03.982 --> 01:51:19.927]  If you think Dylan Mulvaney, destroying Anheuser-Busch, 30-something billion now, Target picking up on it, going, here, hold my beer, showing devil worship, and we're going to recruit your kids to Satan, and we're going to turn them into skeletons, and we're going to cut Christians' heads off.
[01:51:19.927 --> 01:51:24.768]  And then, by the way, I was on the street by a LGBTQ
[01:51:29.125 --> 01:51:29.866]  Yes, we're good.
[01:51:57.791 --> 01:51:59.653]  And I mean, that's really what this is.
[01:51:59.653 --> 01:52:03.616]  It's LGBT-P-S.
[01:52:03.616 --> 01:52:08.219]  The P-S on the end of the LGBT plus is pedophile satanist.
[01:52:08.219 --> 01:52:11.122]  I'm serious.
[01:52:11.122 --> 01:52:13.744]  And you're like, well, they haven't fully taken the government over.
[01:52:13.744 --> 01:52:21.170]  They're literally saying this stuff doesn't exist and this movie's bad.
[01:52:21.170 --> 01:52:22.231]  Talk about jumping the shark.
[01:52:23.715 --> 01:52:31.158]  Toll-free number to join us, 877-789-2539.
[01:52:31.158 --> 01:52:31.858]  877-789-2539.
[01:52:31.858 --> 01:52:34.019]  877-789-Alex.
[01:52:34.019 --> 01:52:35.660]  We're taking first-time callers.
[01:52:35.660 --> 01:52:37.020]  We're taking long-time callers.
[01:52:37.020 --> 01:52:41.582]  We're calling callers that disagree, callers that agree, callers that got questions.
[01:52:41.582 --> 01:52:47.985]  All I asked is it be on the subject of human trafficking.
[01:52:47.985 --> 01:52:51.146]  Men, women, and children.
[01:52:51.146 --> 01:52:52.087]  And what do you make
[01:52:52.932 --> 01:52:53.272]  I don't know.
[01:53:15.532 --> 01:53:23.918]  And now, the attack on the Sound of Freedom, that everybody should go see, and saying it's bad and it's not real and it's evil and it's not good.
[01:53:23.918 --> 01:53:29.701]  I mean, again, every major leftist channel, up one side, down the other, you have to hide under a rock.
[01:53:29.701 --> 01:53:31.783]  We've written a bunch of articles on M4s about it.
[01:53:31.783 --> 01:53:41.609]  Do you want me to play the clips of them saying, this is ridiculous, this isn't true, this is maggots in your brain, this is imaginary, don't worry about sex trafficking.
[01:53:41.609 --> 01:53:45.292]  These people want to imagine they're heroes, they want to imagine they're helping people.
[01:53:47.834 --> 01:53:54.621]  Every few days we hear about another tractor trailer where the drug cartels just lock them up in the heat and they all die inside of it.
[01:53:54.621 --> 01:53:55.542]  Including a bunch of children.
[01:53:56.581 --> 01:53:57.962]  Care about them?
[01:53:57.962 --> 01:53:58.522]  No.
[01:53:58.522 --> 01:54:00.624]  The left doesn't care about real numbers.
[01:54:00.624 --> 01:54:02.145]  They want to abort babies.
[01:54:02.145 --> 01:54:03.786]  They want to sterilize children.
[01:54:03.786 --> 01:54:05.567]  They want to cut your daughter's breast off.
[01:54:05.567 --> 01:54:07.448]  They want to cut your son's genitals off.
[01:54:07.448 --> 01:54:08.889]  They want you to take drugs.
[01:54:08.889 --> 01:54:10.250]  They want you to be unhappy.
[01:54:10.250 --> 01:54:16.154]  I've got articles here today, they're back at it again, saying exercise is white supremacist.
[01:54:16.154 --> 01:54:19.837]  Pandemic fitness trendies have gone extreme.
[01:54:19.837 --> 01:54:21.298]  White supremacist latest scheme.
[01:54:23.735 --> 01:54:25.656]  Pandemic fitness trends have gone extreme.
[01:54:25.656 --> 01:54:26.756]  MSNBC.
[01:54:26.756 --> 01:54:28.757]  White supremism.
[01:54:28.757 --> 01:54:33.158]  Fitness fascism.
[01:54:33.158 --> 01:54:34.079]  Look at this one.
[01:54:34.079 --> 01:54:36.699]  This is The Nation.
[01:54:36.699 --> 01:54:40.801]  Asian-Americans and conservatives have become key allies in white supremacy.
[01:54:44.460 --> 01:54:47.724]  Key allies in white supremacy.
[01:54:47.724 --> 01:54:49.325]  Where's that grand dragon?
[01:54:49.325 --> 01:54:53.690]  Oh, Chung Choy is here.
[01:54:53.690 --> 01:54:56.093]  Seriously, it's like Chung Lu is here.
[01:54:56.093 --> 01:54:57.674]  Where is the main white supremacist?
[01:54:57.674 --> 01:54:59.196]  Here he is.
[01:54:59.196 --> 01:55:00.057]  He's right here.
[01:55:00.057 --> 01:55:05.303]  I mean, this is upside down world, but the same folks that tell us two men can have a baby.
[01:55:07.912 --> 01:55:09.953]  Where do you see all this going?
[01:55:09.953 --> 01:55:11.134]  Continuing.
[01:55:11.134 --> 01:55:14.516]  Bosnia, the United Nations, human trafficking and prostitution.
[01:55:14.516 --> 01:55:17.458]  You'll want to look up that whole saga.
[01:55:17.458 --> 01:55:22.962]  Up close to a crisp million the UN smuggled out of there the last 20 years.
[01:55:22.962 --> 01:55:28.746]  And it just goes on and on and on and on.
[01:55:28.746 --> 01:55:33.889]  Has the UN learned lessons of Bosnian sex slavery revealed?
[01:55:33.889 --> 01:55:34.530]  London Guardian.
[01:55:35.595 --> 01:55:37.977]  But see, that was 11 years ago.
[01:55:37.977 --> 01:55:41.800]  It was okay to talk about it, but now it just does not exist!
[01:55:41.800 --> 01:55:53.830]  Queue up that CNN clip from the Ballard clip, because we've got the full CNN clip, but just that short clip that Ballard responded to, where they just say it's fantasyland, it's manipulating statistics.
[01:55:53.830 --> 01:55:57.894]  French peacekeepers allegedly tied up girls and forced them into bestiality.
[01:55:59.625 --> 01:56:02.267]  NATO forces feeds Kosovo sex trade.
[01:56:02.267 --> 01:56:03.088]  The Guardian.
[01:56:03.088 --> 01:56:05.090]  But see, that was 2004.
[01:56:05.090 --> 01:56:06.591]  You're not allowed to talk about it now.
[01:56:06.591 --> 01:56:07.913]  It doesn't exist.
[01:56:07.913 --> 01:56:09.354]  I mean, you've seen me in court.
[01:56:09.354 --> 01:56:11.716]  It's like, it's a bad thing in front of a jury.
[01:56:11.716 --> 01:56:14.979]  Like, this man believes there's child sex slavery.
[01:56:14.979 --> 01:56:18.342]  Everybody's like, oh, that's what bad men think.
[01:56:18.342 --> 01:56:21.685]  Oh, Austin Jury's like, you think people rape kids?
[01:56:21.685 --> 01:56:25.328]  Well, I mean, we cut their penises off, but what's wrong with that?
[01:56:25.328 --> 01:56:25.849]  We're liberal.
[01:56:28.032 --> 01:56:32.454]  This man claims the state wants to cut your son's penis off.
[01:56:32.454 --> 01:56:33.154]  Well, we do.
[01:56:33.154 --> 01:56:35.376]  That's beautiful.
[01:56:35.376 --> 01:56:38.417]  It's beautiful what we do.
[01:56:38.417 --> 01:56:39.918]  Listen to Rachel Levin.
[01:56:39.918 --> 01:56:42.179]  She's an admiral.
[01:56:42.179 --> 01:56:44.280]  And a beautiful woman.
[01:56:44.280 --> 01:56:48.922]  Ready to star in a horror movie with no makeup needed.
[01:56:48.922 --> 01:56:51.503]  UN Peacekeeping has a sexual abuse problem.
[01:56:53.616 --> 01:56:56.739]  UK says grotesque charity sex abuse scandal.
[01:56:56.739 --> 01:56:58.380]  There's a wake-up call.
[01:56:58.380 --> 01:56:59.701]  Reuters.
[01:56:59.701 --> 01:57:02.563]  Jimmy Savelle, best friend of the king.
[01:57:02.563 --> 01:57:04.585]  Caught with underground sex dungeon.
[01:57:04.585 --> 01:57:06.486]  Caught having sex with dead children.
[01:57:06.486 --> 01:57:12.391]  AP exclusive, you and child sex left victims with no arrests.
[01:57:12.391 --> 01:57:20.517]  Watch, dad fumes as doctor asks seven and nine-year-old sons what gender they are.
[01:57:20.517 --> 01:57:21.358]  But there's some good news.
[01:57:22.990 --> 01:57:29.992]  Sixth Circuit allows Tennessee ban on transgender surgery for minors to go into effect.
[01:57:29.992 --> 01:57:39.034]  How dare them not give life-affirming care to use a mentally ill, brainwashed, autistic child that the state's convinced to have their genitals cut off.
[01:57:39.034 --> 01:57:42.194]  No, we're gonna save you, young lady.
[01:57:42.194 --> 01:57:45.195]  We're gonna cut that feminine penis right off.
[01:57:48.680 --> 01:57:58.288]  With all the craziness in the world, the collapsing borders, the war with Russia, the insanity, the currency devaluations, the economy going crazy.
[01:57:58.288 --> 01:58:03.593]  You are crazy in my view if you don't get high quality storable food and water filtration and self-defense.
[01:58:04.033 --> 01:58:05.714]  Now, we're not selling guns and ammo.
[01:58:05.714 --> 01:58:08.696]  That's for you to go out and get for yourself and learn how to use if you haven't.
[01:58:08.696 --> 01:58:10.337]  And I'm preaching the choir on that.
[01:58:10.337 --> 01:58:15.260]  But a lot of people got plenty of guns, but they don't have enough storable food or water filtration.
[01:58:15.260 --> 01:58:21.564]  This is something you need now, and we've got it in the food department and in the high quality water filtration department.
[01:58:21.564 --> 01:58:27.288]  The highest quality food, the best water filtration at the lowest prices you're going to find and still get quality.
[01:58:27.288 --> 01:58:33.452]  Infowarsstore.com is running a special right now for 10% off on all storable food and on water.
[01:58:33.812 --> 01:58:35.194]  And air filtration.
[01:58:35.194 --> 01:58:37.858]  Ladies and gentlemen, you cannot beat this deal.
[01:58:37.858 --> 01:58:39.160]  Our prices are already the lowest.
[01:58:39.160 --> 01:58:42.045]  At 10% off, it's an insane deal for a limited time.
[01:58:42.045 --> 01:58:45.951]  Go to nfowarstore.com and get prepared while you still can.
[01:58:48.680 --> 01:58:53.082]  You're going to want to pay attention to what I'm about to say in the next 60 seconds.
[01:58:53.082 --> 01:58:58.324]  Two new incredible products are now available exclusively at mfullmorestore.com.
[01:58:58.324 --> 01:59:06.107]  They are both clones of national best-selling products from a major pharmaceutical slash supplement maker that are listeners and patriots.
[01:59:06.107 --> 01:59:10.669]  They're allowing us to private label it at a lower price you'll find in stores.
[01:59:10.669 --> 01:59:13.851]  It's Joint Relief Max and Nerve Renew.
[01:59:14.651 --> 01:59:27.680]  Both of these have known, documented natural compounds to lower pain and also make your nerves healthier, which is one of the major reasons nerves get irritated and are more inductive to pain.
[01:59:27.680 --> 01:59:29.981]  There's major research behind this all.
[01:59:29.981 --> 01:59:34.044]  You need to get Joint Relief Max from InfoWarsMD and Nerve
[01:59:34.604 --> 01:59:38.467]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[02:00:04.548 --> 02:00:14.434]  The revelator told us 2,000 plus years ago about a planetary world government that would create a beast system we had to worship and follow or we couldn't buy or sell.
[02:00:14.434 --> 02:00:17.315]  We'd have a digital mark on our hand and forehead.
[02:00:17.315 --> 02:00:18.356]  Now it's all come true.
[02:00:18.356 --> 02:00:20.557]  That's why Depeche Mode says he's a fraud.
[02:00:20.557 --> 02:00:26.241]  Yeah, if she wanted to give you the winning lottery tickets 10 times in a row, they're bad.
[02:00:28.032 --> 02:00:30.372]  When somebody's accurate, that's when they're a fraud.
[02:00:30.372 --> 02:00:30.833]  Just like me.
[02:00:30.833 --> 02:00:36.534]  I'm not saying I'm John the Revelator, but definitely a close ten-thousandth.
[02:00:36.534 --> 02:00:39.074]  Crank it up.
[02:00:39.074 --> 02:00:47.616]  Let's put something else on while we're playing this.
[02:00:47.616 --> 02:00:50.756]  I'm pretty ridiculous looking for Lex Luthor now.
[02:00:50.756 --> 02:00:51.436]  Alright.
[02:00:51.436 --> 02:00:53.957]  Alright, let's get serious here.
[02:00:56.340 --> 02:01:03.062]  The thing I need to get serious about is this.
[02:01:03.062 --> 02:01:04.343]  You gotta love Depeche Mode.
[02:01:04.343 --> 02:01:08.844]  It's great sounding music, but so badly written.
[02:01:08.844 --> 02:01:14.826]  Imagine John the Revelator stealing his God from the Muslims.
[02:01:14.826 --> 02:01:21.869]  The Muslims didn't exist for 400 and something years after John the Revelator.
[02:01:21.869 --> 02:01:22.029]  So...
[02:01:23.447 --> 02:01:29.551]  It's like saying the Wright Brothers stole flight from Lockheed Martin.
[02:01:29.551 --> 02:01:30.271]  Look, I'm digressing.
[02:01:30.271 --> 02:01:32.133]  We've got a load of phone lines.
[02:01:32.133 --> 02:01:41.119]  Nick and Joshua and Stacy and Peter and Carlos and Jackson and Paris and Jared and Victor and Eben and Carlos.
[02:01:41.119 --> 02:01:44.581]  We're going to take all your phone calls, one after the other, when we start the next segment.
[02:01:46.462 --> 02:02:02.712]  But I've not gotten to a bunch of those newscasts I told you about, dealing with just constant pedo busts going on around the country, and that when you see these stories break, you very rarely see any news coverage of it.
[02:02:02.712 --> 02:02:08.196]  So let's play back to back here real quick.
[02:02:08.196 --> 02:02:12.619]  You know what, let's wait for the next segment, some stations join us, because I'm going to come back, play this, then go to your calls.
[02:02:12.619 --> 02:02:15.741]  Because first I want to play CNN saying this doesn't exist.
[02:02:17.145 --> 02:02:22.107]  And then I've got a whole bunch of local newscasts just this week with this stuff going on.
[02:02:22.107 --> 02:02:23.848]  And everybody knows about this stuff.
[02:02:23.848 --> 02:02:36.754]  Everybody knows about sex trafficking and the pimps and the kidnapped kids and how the Latin Americans have been caught in all the Veritas reports and the admissions and the sex crime statistics in the Senate report that Obama knowingly placed him with them.
[02:02:36.754 --> 02:02:37.854]  We already showed you that.
[02:02:37.854 --> 02:02:43.437]  But just imagine, because I can't get over it, I'll be completely honest with you.
[02:02:43.437 --> 02:02:45.457]  Let's play the CNN clip going out to break.
[02:02:45.457 --> 02:02:46.358]  We'll come back with the other clip.
[02:02:47.248 --> 02:02:50.931]  I just can't imagine that we're actually in this place.
[02:02:50.931 --> 02:02:52.752]  I keep pinching myself at this point.
[02:02:52.752 --> 02:02:54.393]  Even Alex Jones can't believe it.
[02:02:54.393 --> 02:03:03.480]  And I'm like, I've got dozens of clips of corporate media saying don't watch the movie and it's lies and nobody wants to kidnap your kid.
[02:03:05.427 --> 02:03:17.058]  Meanwhile, I'm a newshound, so I look at the news all day and I see child kidnapped here, child kidnapped there, child found here in a hotel right by dozens of men, child found dead, and I'm sitting there, and it's only in local news.
[02:03:17.058 --> 02:03:19.540]  So again, why is that not national news?
[02:03:19.540 --> 02:03:28.368]  Sometimes the national news will choose some little girl that goes missing, and then they'll make it the biggest story ever, and everybody, you know, they'll focus you on that one.
[02:03:28.368 --> 02:03:29.228]  Meanwhile, there's millions.
[02:03:30.009 --> 02:03:33.551]  And it just makes you think, how big is this underground of pedophiles?
[02:03:33.551 --> 02:03:36.193]  I mean, how many of these people are there?
[02:03:36.193 --> 02:03:37.834]  And I think it's a pretty big army.
[02:03:37.834 --> 02:03:39.475]  They're pretty confident now.
[02:03:39.475 --> 02:03:40.736]  Look at Drag Queen Pedo Time.
[02:03:40.736 --> 02:03:41.797]  Look at all of it.
[02:03:41.797 --> 02:03:42.577]  Look at Disney.
[02:03:42.577 --> 02:03:44.699]  Look at all the Disney executives.
[02:03:44.699 --> 02:03:45.759]  They're convicted pedophiles.
[02:03:45.759 --> 02:03:47.821]  They rehire rapists of children.
[02:03:47.821 --> 02:03:48.281]  Here's a clip.
[02:03:49.884 --> 02:04:13.913]  These films are created out of moral panics, they're created out of bogus statistics, they're created out of fear, and with something like Sound of Freedom, it specifically is looking at QAnon concepts of these child trafficking rings that are run by the high-level elites, and only people like Tim Ballard, and only people like Jim Caviezel, and by extension, only people like the ticket buyer, can help bring these trafficking rings down.
[02:04:14.890 --> 02:04:21.034]  But if you buy an electric car that's super toxic and has slave mines, you're saving the earth, though.
[02:04:21.034 --> 02:04:29.418]  But we're bad saying there's human trafficking when the Texas border and others have totally collapsed with Mexico, and there's just a pell-mell human trafficking nightmare down there.
[02:04:29.418 --> 02:04:30.219]  Go look there.
[02:04:30.219 --> 02:04:34.561]  We got a little smarmy, you know, guy there.
[02:04:34.561 --> 02:04:35.782]  Look, I'm not saying he's not qualified.
[02:04:35.782 --> 02:04:38.643]  In fact, if I need a babysitter, I'm going to call that guy.
[02:04:38.643 --> 02:04:40.765]  Hey, will you come by and watch my babies for me?
[02:04:42.734 --> 02:04:47.060]  I really think you're... Him and Ryan Stelter should start a daycare center together.
[02:04:47.060 --> 02:04:49.283]  Because they'll save our kids, right?
[02:04:49.283 --> 02:04:51.305]  That's right.
[02:04:51.305 --> 02:04:53.228]  What a nice young man.
[02:04:53.228 --> 02:04:55.951]  He's very proud of himself.
[02:04:55.951 --> 02:04:56.512]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:56.512 --> 02:04:56.873]  Stay with us.
[02:04:59.192 --> 02:05:01.374]  The globalists are only humans.
[02:05:01.374 --> 02:05:03.035]  Yeah, they have control of the central banks.
[02:05:03.035 --> 02:05:04.036]  They have a lot of power.
[02:05:04.036 --> 02:05:05.377]  But they can be defeated.
[02:05:05.377 --> 02:05:08.600]  But some of their operations are going to take decades to stop.
[02:05:08.600 --> 02:05:16.807]  But one thing you can do right now is take control of your body and your family's body by purifying the water that you drink and that you cook with.
[02:05:16.807 --> 02:05:20.410]  And you do it with the highest quality gravity-fed filter out there.
[02:05:20.410 --> 02:05:21.251]  This thing does 10,000 gallons.
[02:05:22.612 --> 02:05:25.313]  You can sit there and put hundreds of gallons through in a day.
[02:05:25.313 --> 02:05:29.895]  It purifies very quickly and it cuts out thousands of chemicals to non-detectable levels.
[02:05:29.895 --> 02:05:31.896]  This is what I use, which my family uses.
[02:05:31.896 --> 02:05:34.057]  It's the very best system out there for the lowest price.
[02:05:34.057 --> 02:05:36.838]  For a limited time, 10% off on top of that.
[02:05:36.838 --> 02:05:41.941]  Exclusively at InfowarStore.com on the Alexa Pure Water Filtration System.
[02:05:41.941 --> 02:05:45.562]  In stock and replacement filters for folks that need those in stock.
[02:05:45.562 --> 02:05:47.263]  Get it today and it funds the Infowar.
[02:05:47.623 --> 02:05:48.463]  Don't procrastinate.
[02:05:48.463 --> 02:05:55.425]  This is one of the main areas we can take control of our lives and stop the globalists from hitting us with poison that they allow in the water supply.
[02:05:55.425 --> 02:06:00.206]  In some cases they add the water supply like fluoride.
[02:06:00.206 --> 02:06:01.346]  Big Brother.
[02:06:01.346 --> 02:06:03.146]  Mainstream media.
[02:06:03.146 --> 02:06:05.067]  Government cover-ups.
[02:06:05.067 --> 02:06:06.747]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:06:06.747 --> 02:06:08.408]  Well, so does he.
[02:06:08.408 --> 02:06:12.909]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:16.522 --> 02:06:19.805]  Get out on the highway!
[02:06:19.805 --> 02:06:24.388]  Lookin' to Recipedos and other pubbers to come our way!
[02:06:24.388 --> 02:06:28.932]  Our brother's gonna make it happen!
[02:06:28.932 --> 02:06:33.475]  Take the world in a loving place!
[02:06:33.475 --> 02:06:38.759]  Fire all of your guns at once and explode into space!
[02:06:38.759 --> 02:06:42.642]  I love smokin' lightnin'!
[02:06:42.642 --> 02:06:42.822]  So!
[02:06:44.591 --> 02:07:07.621]  There have been a lot of reporters on ABC, CBS, MSNBC, CNN, Washington Post, New York Times, Rolling Stone Magazine, come out and say that Sound of Freedom is a fraud, there's no child kidnapping going on, you got brain worms, you're terrible if you believe what's going on.
[02:07:07.621 --> 02:07:12.043]  And they attack a movie based on certified true stories, convictions, all these kids say.
[02:07:13.226 --> 02:07:20.069]  So I was like, since I just chose one little swarmy clip out of dozens that I've seen, I said, who is that CNN commentator?
[02:07:20.069 --> 02:07:21.429]  What's that guy's name?
[02:07:21.429 --> 02:07:24.331]  Let's put him up on screen if we can here.
[02:07:24.331 --> 02:07:27.732]  His name is Mike Rothschild.
[02:07:27.732 --> 02:07:29.333]  We ought to invite him on the show.
[02:07:29.333 --> 02:07:31.074]  Hey, Mike.
[02:07:31.074 --> 02:07:32.874]  We'd like to invite him down to Texas.
[02:07:32.874 --> 02:07:34.335]  We can take him to the border.
[02:07:34.335 --> 02:07:36.216]  I'm officially going to invite Mike Rothschild.
[02:07:36.216 --> 02:07:38.076]  I want Scott to call him.
[02:07:38.076 --> 02:07:38.857]  Or Daria to call him.
[02:07:38.857 --> 02:07:41.398]  I want to say, Mike, we'll fly you down here.
[02:07:43.163 --> 02:07:56.748]  And we'll give you first class treatment and we'll go to the Texas border and I'll show you little kids without any IDs or any information being handed over to random charities and strangers with no record of where they're going.
[02:07:56.748 --> 02:07:59.189]  And do you think that that is a good idea?
[02:08:06.630 --> 02:08:17.979]  I mean, because I'm just trying to find out, because, you know, I don't think you're probably related to the Rothschilds, the actual guys heavily invested in the Atlantic slave trade, and all the rest of that.
[02:08:17.979 --> 02:08:32.331]  But I'm saying, the Atlantic sex trade happened, mass shootings are real, those happened too, we're not supposed to ever question any big event, but you guys are saying there's no child sex slavery, or it's all big, exaggerated, so people can play the part of heroes, right?
[02:08:34.813 --> 02:08:39.716]  Why don't you guys queue up some of the footage we've got of the charities lady saying, this is my baby, just handing them off.
[02:08:39.716 --> 02:08:40.437]  We got all this.
[02:08:40.437 --> 02:08:42.058]  And she's back there.
[02:08:42.058 --> 02:08:43.059]  Oh, it's my baby.
[02:08:43.059 --> 02:08:46.161]  And then they just hand them off to just disappear to God knows where.
[02:08:46.161 --> 02:08:54.386]  But even even the New Yorker magazine and the New York Times are kind of schizophrenic on this.
[02:08:54.386 --> 02:09:01.751]  Because they've got articles about sex slavery and sex trafficking and human slavery of children in sweat houses.
[02:09:01.751 --> 02:09:04.473]  Sweat shops, industrial labor.
[02:09:06.112 --> 02:09:10.337]  Little girls getting their pigtails caught in the, you know, conveyor belt.
[02:09:10.337 --> 02:09:13.301]  Half their scalp pulled off.
[02:09:13.301 --> 02:09:16.986]  But then you're saying it doesn't exist!
[02:09:16.986 --> 02:09:18.568]  And I guess you are swarmy and...
[02:09:19.904 --> 02:09:25.165]  Everything, so I guess that there's no, I mean, hell, the federal government just took off the Justice Department website.
[02:09:25.165 --> 02:09:29.726]  Child sex trafficking, child sex slavery, child prostitution, it officially doesn't exist anymore.
[02:09:29.726 --> 02:09:33.267]  Because it's like, the dam's broken, it's everywhere, it's just exploded.
[02:09:33.267 --> 02:09:47.510]  But it doesn't matter, we have CNN with no viewers, with a cockroach like this, climbing up out of the bowels of hell, to swarmily tell us that it doesn't
[02:09:48.891 --> 02:09:55.655]  Compute that that that Mr. Ballard, Jim Ballard and others are just want to be heroes.
[02:09:55.655 --> 02:09:59.117]  But here's your real hero.
[02:09:59.117 --> 02:10:13.366]  And meanwhile, you have the storm run by leftists and globalist intelligence agencies to take all the real stories of child sex trafficking and world government, the new world order, and then make it look ridiculous and sound insane, show that they can then say, see, none of it exists.
[02:10:17.836 --> 02:10:27.005]  And then imagine being the apologist for that and saying Tim Ballard's work of decades and the convictions and all of it's nothing.
[02:10:27.005 --> 02:10:27.826]  It doesn't exist.
[02:10:27.826 --> 02:10:29.427]  It's a fraud.
[02:10:29.427 --> 02:10:35.413]  I supposedly lost a billion and a half dollars for saying maybe a mass shooting didn't happen because the Internet was questioning it.
[02:10:35.413 --> 02:10:37.074]  And they said you can never question this.
[02:10:37.074 --> 02:10:38.736]  You can never question a mass shooting.
[02:10:40.057 --> 02:10:42.638]  And the media dredged it up and blew it up, made it a huge deal.
[02:10:42.638 --> 02:10:49.799]  And years after I said I thought it happened, I got sued, a judge found me guilty, which is not supposed to do in America, a jury was told all this stuff, and they said a billion and a half dollars.
[02:10:49.799 --> 02:10:54.060]  Well, I didn't have two million dollars.
[02:10:54.060 --> 02:11:01.802]  But under that rule, this guy's saying, child sex trafficking, he's lessening the pain of these children.
[02:11:01.802 --> 02:11:04.383]  He's, he's, he's poo-pooing them.
[02:11:04.383 --> 02:11:05.863]  Now, I believe he has a First Amendment.
[02:11:07.148 --> 02:11:09.289]  I don't think Mr. Rothschild thinks I have one.
[02:11:09.289 --> 02:11:15.153]  But no, he has a right to say there's no human trafficking at the border, there's no sex slavery, there's no sweatshops.
[02:11:15.153 --> 02:11:18.515]  He has a right to say the moon's made out of cheese.
[02:11:18.515 --> 02:11:28.322]  We have a right to go down there and show you the truth.
[02:11:28.322 --> 02:11:29.503]  Is that Alexander Soros?
[02:11:31.354 --> 02:11:35.076]  Are these, like, clones that come out of the same, like, factory warehouse or something?
[02:11:35.076 --> 02:11:39.198]  Or the same tank?
[02:11:39.198 --> 02:11:41.019]  I mean, woo-hoo!
[02:11:41.019 --> 02:11:45.281]  Let me just thank the good Lord, I ain't this guy.
[02:11:45.281 --> 02:11:46.901]  Poor thing can't help it.
[02:11:46.901 --> 02:11:50.343]  Let's go ahead and play another clip of him and we'll go to your calls.
[02:11:54.389 --> 02:12:05.332]  And you seem pretty familiar with him because he doesn't really hide his association with this real wild plot that involves, you know, drinking the...
[02:12:08.286 --> 02:12:09.907]  No, he doesn't hide it at all.
[02:12:09.907 --> 02:12:14.088]  And you have a lot of people who are in this world of QAnon who say, oh, they don't know what that is.
[02:12:14.088 --> 02:12:15.128]  They've never heard of it.
[02:12:15.128 --> 02:12:16.709]  They're just asking questions.
[02:12:16.709 --> 02:12:19.770]  With somebody like Jim Caviezel, he is openly embracing it.
[02:12:19.770 --> 02:12:22.451]  He's openly using its catchphrases and its concepts.
[02:12:22.451 --> 02:12:24.612]  He's speaking at QAnon conventions.
[02:12:24.612 --> 02:12:34.195]  And this film is being marketed to either specific QAnon believers or to people who believe all of the same tenets as QAnon, but claim they don't know what it is.
[02:12:35.293 --> 02:12:40.180]  And The Sound of Freedom does focus on a real issue of sex trafficking.
[02:12:40.180 --> 02:12:47.491]  But that theme, it's sort of like that kernel of truth that feeds the QAnon conspiracy theory.
[02:12:47.491 --> 02:12:50.375]  Tell us how those two things work together.
[02:12:52.432 --> 02:12:57.173]  Sure, and the most durable and the most believable conspiracy theories are not entirely false.
[02:12:57.173 --> 02:13:00.874]  There's something in them that is true and the rest of it is false.
[02:13:00.874 --> 02:13:05.616]  But the believers point to the one true thing and they say, oh, you don't believe that this particular thing is true.
[02:13:05.616 --> 02:13:08.556]  In terms of child trafficking, we know trafficking is real.
[02:13:08.556 --> 02:13:09.917]  We know it has real victims.
[02:13:09.917 --> 02:13:10.977]  No one is denying that.
[02:13:11.437 --> 02:13:35.821]  But these films are created out of moral panics, they're created out of bogus statistics, they're created out of fear, and with something like Sound of Freedom, it specifically is looking at QAnon concepts of these child trafficking rings that are run by the high-level elites, and only people like Tim Ballard, and only people like Jim Caviezel, and by extension, only people like the Ticket Buyer, can help bring these trafficking rings down.
[02:13:37.777 --> 02:13:46.184]  So, we're not denying it's happening, we're just denying Jeffrey Epstein, Mossad, CIA, and MI6 ran tens of thousands of little girls and boys.
[02:13:46.184 --> 02:13:56.793]  We're not denying it's happening, we're just not going to get into NYGARD, and them even having women give birth to babies so they can be exsanguinated for body parts for rich men.
[02:13:56.793 --> 02:14:03.759]  We're not saying it's, you know, happening, we don't want to hear about the UN and giant child kidnapping rings, or the deputy head of the Clinton Foundation being convicted for smuggling children.
[02:14:05.069 --> 02:14:09.830]  We don't want to, you know, oh, no, no, children are being abused, just not all the big official cases.
[02:14:09.830 --> 02:14:14.711]  Oh, and no one's getting organs from children, even though it's on record they are.
[02:14:14.711 --> 02:14:18.552]  No one's getting their blood.
[02:14:18.552 --> 02:14:24.054]  Well, I can pull up where they have headlines from federal court in documents.
[02:14:24.054 --> 02:14:27.234]  Babies, fetuses delivered with still beating hearts to U.S.
[02:14:27.234 --> 02:14:29.355]  research facilities and universities.
[02:14:29.355 --> 02:14:30.475]  Remember that breaking?
[02:14:30.475 --> 02:14:32.796]  Or baby parts used in flavoring.
[02:14:33.877 --> 02:14:34.118]  I think?
[02:14:48.266 --> 02:14:49.286]  No, no, no, no, no.
[02:14:49.286 --> 02:15:08.595]  Imagine the state secretly talks to your autistic seven-year-old, who's a boy, and gives them lollipops and candy and sends them to a meeting with other kids that say they're really in other sex, and then you're secretly put in a database that's kept secret from your parents, and then the parents are approached when they're seven or eight and told, your child wants to
[02:15:09.535 --> 02:15:16.662]  Transition to another sex and if you complain, multiple states have passed laws to take your child from you.
[02:15:16.662 --> 02:15:19.665]  Or even if your child ran away, they would take them.
[02:15:19.665 --> 02:15:25.890]  The government would then put them in a secret facility and never tell you where they went and you would just think your kid had disappeared.
[02:15:25.890 --> 02:15:29.794]  That's law in Washington State.
[02:15:29.794 --> 02:15:32.276]  That's law in other states.
[02:15:32.276 --> 02:15:32.837]  Imagine
[02:15:33.695 --> 02:15:43.001]  Cutting little boy's genitals off and then for years putting a giant prosthesis in there to make the open wound stay open, hoping it healed, and in most cases it doesn't.
[02:15:43.001 --> 02:16:03.275]  Imagine ripping the forearm muscles off of little girls and their thigh legs and then building giant, lifeless, painful, no pleasure center penises that on average fall off within six months and have a piece of PVC pipe stuck in them, a plastic tube as the urethra.
[02:16:06.271 --> 02:16:08.772]  And then you wonder why they commit suicide.
[02:16:08.772 --> 02:16:17.638]  Imagine a world where little girls have their forearms cut off so the muscle can make a fake penis.
[02:16:17.638 --> 02:16:20.119]  That's even more preposterous.
[02:16:20.119 --> 02:16:23.301]  But see, Q doesn't talk about that because Q's run by the globalists.
[02:16:24.454 --> 02:16:27.035]  Not the poor Q followers, but the disinfo.
[02:16:27.035 --> 02:16:28.895]  Oh, underground bases, millions of kids.
[02:16:28.895 --> 02:16:31.656]  Oh, there's earthquakes because the special forces are saving them.
[02:16:31.656 --> 02:16:42.059]  No, the special forces are at the Texas border under the orders of the president to help ship the children in.
[02:16:42.059 --> 02:16:47.700]  The State Guard, the National Guard, they complete the smuggling process.
[02:16:47.700 --> 02:16:49.101]  The government's overrun.
[02:16:49.101 --> 02:16:53.082]  The indictments are for Donald Trump and the patriots, not imaginary indictments.
[02:16:57.560 --> 02:16:58.440]  I'm going to go to your break.
[02:16:58.440 --> 02:17:01.421]  I'm going to go to your calls.
[02:17:01.421 --> 02:17:04.542]  It's just mind-blowing to sit here and watch this.
[02:17:04.542 --> 02:17:07.442]  They're mutilating children out in the open.
[02:17:07.442 --> 02:17:15.544]  They're not even doing DNA testing of children now that they just turn loose with no ID so that when they get found dead later, it's a nameless person.
[02:17:15.544 --> 02:17:16.765]  They're covering their tracks.
[02:17:16.765 --> 02:17:17.805]  It's out in the open.
[02:17:17.805 --> 02:17:26.927]  And then some smarmy, crazy, bug-eyed weasel head that if I was going to make a new Dracula movie,
[02:17:30.271 --> 02:17:32.752]  I would probably cast Nick Cage.
[02:17:32.752 --> 02:17:35.494]  I saw him in that new comedy Dracula movie, it was pretty good.
[02:17:35.494 --> 02:17:39.877]  I would cast like Nick Cage as Dracula.
[02:17:39.877 --> 02:17:48.641]  And then the guys that work for Dracula that go out and grab the kids for him would be Rothschild and Brian Stalter.
[02:17:48.641 --> 02:17:50.963]  I think he would have a couple Renfields in this new movie.
[02:17:51.687 --> 02:17:54.668]  Because, man, you see them walk in, no makeup needed, no nothing.
[02:17:54.668 --> 02:17:56.808]  I mean, we're talking knuckle-draggers.
[02:17:56.808 --> 02:17:58.728]  And I'm not saying they go out and grab kids.
[02:17:58.728 --> 02:17:59.569]  Of course not.
[02:17:59.569 --> 02:18:08.590]  They just go on TV and the Davos Group and call for censorship and control and say, nobody's hurting kids.
[02:18:08.590 --> 02:18:12.311]  Yeah, there might be a little trafficking here and there, but nobody's killing them.
[02:18:12.311 --> 02:18:14.131]  There's no governments involved.
[02:18:14.131 --> 02:18:16.912]  I mean, that is just ridiculous.
[02:18:18.407 --> 02:18:25.789]  There are no governments involved like MI6, CIA, Mossad.
[02:18:25.789 --> 02:18:28.009]  None of them.
[02:18:28.009 --> 02:18:29.630]  Zero.
[02:18:29.630 --> 02:18:31.730]  It's not happening.
[02:18:31.730 --> 02:18:37.011]  But there are record white supremacists everywhere killing everyone.
[02:18:37.011 --> 02:18:39.752]  You just saw in Dallas those Hispanic KKK guys.
[02:18:39.752 --> 02:18:41.833]  They weren't in the KKK, but whatever.
[02:18:41.833 --> 02:18:46.534]  They, you know, it's their, it's any crime.
[02:18:46.534 --> 02:18:47.354]  It's white people's fault.
[02:18:48.226 --> 02:18:53.929]  I mean, you just heard earlier, like, Asians are now white supremacists, so... Alright, I'm gonna go to your phone calls.
[02:18:53.929 --> 02:18:55.230]  I really appreciate you all holding.
[02:18:55.230 --> 02:18:58.051]  I, uh, mentioned this, and I'll just take calls until this ends.
[02:18:58.051 --> 02:18:58.711]  I'll get to everybody.
[02:18:58.711 --> 02:19:00.152]  I really appreciate you.
[02:19:00.152 --> 02:19:02.953]  Here's the local newscast, which again, again, doesn't exist.
[02:19:02.953 --> 02:19:05.935]  A Franklin, Tennessee man finds a cell phone at a pizza shop.
[02:19:05.935 --> 02:19:07.096]  Mmm, pizza.
[02:19:07.096 --> 02:19:08.196]  Pizza, pizza.
[02:19:08.196 --> 02:19:12.899]  And it leads to the arrest of the soccer coach who drugged and raped children.
[02:19:12.899 --> 02:19:13.819]  That just can't be!
[02:19:13.819 --> 02:19:16.981]  I mean... That just can't be.
[02:19:16.981 --> 02:19:17.481]  Here, here it is.
[02:19:18.499 --> 02:19:23.440]  A shop worker is to thank for this shocking discovery that was made on Compost's phone.
[02:19:23.440 --> 02:19:28.242]  News 2's Megan Kernan spoke with the man who says he was mortified.
[02:19:28.242 --> 02:19:29.642]  It was just a real busy night.
[02:19:29.642 --> 02:19:32.003]  You know, we were getting ready to close down.
[02:19:32.003 --> 02:19:34.083]  We had a real late rush out of nowhere.
[02:19:34.083 --> 02:19:40.605]  And near the end, one of our customers came up and handed me a phone.
[02:19:40.605 --> 02:19:46.367]  Trying to figure out who it belonged to, Joshua LaRue started searching through the unlocked phone.
[02:19:46.607 --> 02:19:52.272]  Then there was a video on there and the video just definitely led me to believe that this was a problem.
[02:19:52.272 --> 02:19:58.858]  What LaRue found and said was dozens of photos and videos of unconscious children.
[02:19:58.858 --> 02:20:06.884]  I called the non-emergency number and they said, I told them I think I had found a phone with child pornography on it.
[02:20:06.884 --> 02:20:12.469]  I mean, imagine trying to find somebody whose phone it is and you find something like that.
[02:20:12.469 --> 02:20:14.231]  Something terrible, I mean, awful.
[02:20:14.611 --> 02:20:19.613]  LaRue's manager says Campos went to Marcos the day after looking for his phone.
[02:20:19.613 --> 02:20:28.696]  She quickly took a picture of his car outside the restaurant before he drove away, ultimately leading Franklin Police right to him and to arrest him.
[02:20:28.696 --> 02:20:30.577]  He acted very nervous.
[02:20:30.577 --> 02:20:32.298]  He really did.
[02:20:32.298 --> 02:20:33.758]  I mean, his hands were shaking.
[02:20:33.758 --> 02:20:35.339]  He was very panicky.
[02:20:35.339 --> 02:20:36.939]  He was like, I left my phone right here.
[02:20:36.939 --> 02:20:38.460]  That's the only thing I could understand him saying.
[02:20:38.720 --> 02:20:43.284]  LaRue tells us he was disgusted at what he discovered, and still is.
[02:20:43.284 --> 02:20:45.206]  He's just really having a hard time.
[02:20:45.206 --> 02:20:47.208]  He's having a hard time with it.
[02:20:47.208 --> 02:20:48.329]  It's very disturbing.
[02:20:48.329 --> 02:20:50.752]  No one ever wants to see anything like that.
[02:20:50.752 --> 02:20:57.218]  But LaRue says knowing Campos is behind bars now, he'd do it all over again in a heartbeat.
[02:20:57.218 --> 02:21:01.182]  And he's holding out hope that the remaining victims will be identified soon.
[02:21:01.502 --> 02:21:08.445]  That's all I can hope is that they get the help that they need and that they can, you know, have a happy life.
[02:21:08.445 --> 02:21:14.088]  That's all I want from this.
[02:21:14.088 --> 02:21:21.531]  And Marco's Pizza has even offered to pay for LaRue to be seen by a therapist since he's still struggling with a traumatic night.
[02:21:21.531 --> 02:21:27.473]  All of LaRue's co-workers are calling him a hero for his quick response after the shocking discovery.
[02:21:27.473 --> 02:21:28.514]  Haley.
[02:21:28.514 --> 02:21:29.594]  Okay, well that's great.
[02:21:29.594 --> 02:21:30.855]  Why is it a national news story?
[02:21:32.842 --> 02:21:35.806]  And why aren't we hearing about the victims?
[02:21:35.806 --> 02:21:36.687]  This is what always happens.
[02:21:36.687 --> 02:21:39.090]  You see it and it disappears.
[02:21:39.090 --> 02:21:51.985]  But meanwhile, I just want to say, what's up with the glamour shots of Brian Stelter and Mike Rothschild and other people?
[02:21:53.001 --> 02:21:55.223]  Like, do they not know how psychotic they look?
[02:21:55.223 --> 02:21:58.185]  Like that Alexander Soros deal.
[02:21:58.185 --> 02:22:03.228]  We know Biden doesn't know how crazy he looks, because he's like, you know, brain dead.
[02:22:03.228 --> 02:22:07.872]  But just imagine you release this as your glamour shot.
[02:22:07.872 --> 02:22:15.717]  Just thank your lucky stars every day that you're not Brian Stelter.
[02:22:15.717 --> 02:22:16.978]  Wow.
[02:22:16.978 --> 02:22:17.598]  All I can say is,
[02:22:19.620 --> 02:22:21.562]  Whoa!
[02:22:21.562 --> 02:22:34.711]  There is the admiral, the first female admiral of the new admiralty at Health and Human Services who wants to help your children lose their genitals, Rachel Levine!
[02:22:34.711 --> 02:22:36.913]  Levine!
[02:22:36.913 --> 02:22:40.116]  Wow!
[02:22:40.116 --> 02:22:41.176]  Interesting, yes.
[02:22:41.176 --> 02:22:42.517]  No one's after our children.
[02:22:42.517 --> 02:22:44.719]  Everything's fine.
[02:22:44.719 --> 02:22:45.740]  Everything's fine.
[02:22:45.740 --> 02:22:46.821]  Look at this nice lady.
[02:22:48.158 --> 02:22:49.818]  Ah, please get him off the screen.
[02:22:49.818 --> 02:22:54.440]  Okay, let's go ahead now and go to Carlos in Canada, then Nick in Tennessee and others.
[02:22:54.440 --> 02:22:56.880]  Carlos, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:22:56.880 --> 02:22:58.741]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:22:58.741 --> 02:23:06.642]  I wanted to draw attention to something that is slipping under the curtains and nobody's really doing anything about it.
[02:23:06.642 --> 02:23:17.005]  And it concerns the FBI, it concerns Huma Abedin, a World Forum Young Global Leader, believe it or not.
[02:23:17.654 --> 02:23:22.715]  And her husband's laptop, Anthony Weiner's laptop.
[02:23:22.715 --> 02:23:29.457]  Two days after Jeffrey Epstein sort of left us, the FBI was all over Little St.
[02:23:29.457 --> 02:23:30.438]  James Island.
[02:23:30.438 --> 02:23:34.819]  I thought, my God, they're going to come back with some real evidence.
[02:23:34.819 --> 02:23:45.102]  As a matter of fact, I think they were just doing a nice cleaning and bleaching everything, because for all we know, the laptop contained information
[02:23:45.563 --> 02:23:48.485]  Which was very revealing of what was going on in Little St.
[02:23:48.485 --> 02:23:49.966]  James Island.
[02:23:49.966 --> 02:23:58.490]  And there you have visitors to the island, which are in the tapes apparently, in a laptop.
[02:23:58.490 --> 02:24:00.792]  Twelve people were at the laptop.
[02:24:00.792 --> 02:24:01.592]  Hold on a second.
[02:24:01.592 --> 02:24:07.435]  CNN's Mike Rothschild told me there are no elites, no islands, no government involvement.
[02:24:07.435 --> 02:24:08.016]  So I'm going to have to...
[02:24:09.335 --> 02:24:11.515]  Carlos, you know if CNN says something, it's true.
[02:24:11.515 --> 02:24:16.836]  Are you saying there's government and elite involvement in sex trafficking to blackmail people?
[02:24:16.836 --> 02:24:20.377]  Because Mike Rothschild said that that's not real.
[02:24:20.377 --> 02:24:23.438]  Well, he's a pedophilia denier.
[02:24:23.438 --> 02:24:24.258]  No, no, no.
[02:24:24.258 --> 02:24:25.758]  He's on CNN, sir.
[02:24:25.758 --> 02:24:29.379]  That's like, he's impossible for him to be wrong.
[02:24:29.379 --> 02:24:31.319]  Well, worms in the head, I don't know.
[02:24:31.319 --> 02:24:36.060]  But I certainly know that he is denying that, let's say, there's no pedophilia in Brooklyn.
[02:24:37.101 --> 02:24:39.162]  Would you care to Google that?
[02:24:39.162 --> 02:24:40.523]  He should know.
[02:24:40.523 --> 02:24:47.426]  And if you want to talk about Rothschild, Lynne Forrester, the Rothschild, is in the flight logs in the Little St.
[02:24:47.426 --> 02:24:51.028]  James trips on the Lolita Express with Jeffrey Epstein.
[02:24:51.548 --> 02:24:52.989]  So, I mean, let's get real.
[02:24:52.989 --> 02:24:59.813]  Oh, now you're saying the Rothschilds pose with black magic queens in front of paintings of Lucifer.
[02:24:59.813 --> 02:25:01.935]  Sir, I appreciate your call.
[02:25:01.935 --> 02:25:05.557]  Anthony Weiner is a wonderful person, and so is Jeffrey Epstein.
[02:25:05.557 --> 02:25:07.358]  Of course, I'm being sarcastic.
[02:25:07.358 --> 02:25:10.320]  I mean, this is just desperateness, folks.
[02:25:10.320 --> 02:25:18.625]  And imagine being seen and they go, let's have this little chicken neck guy on here to attack Sound of Freedom, and that'll make everybody shut up.
[02:25:22.338 --> 02:25:23.039]  Wow.
[02:25:23.039 --> 02:25:25.302]  Nick in Tennessee, thanks for holding her on the air worldwide.
[02:25:41.337 --> 02:25:46.361]  In fact, we'll probably play that short intro for you about Hunter Biden and the cocaine.
[02:25:46.361 --> 02:25:47.482]  Hey, we're moving quick, Nick.
[02:25:47.482 --> 02:25:48.362]  What's on your mind?
[02:25:48.362 --> 02:25:49.303]  I love you, Alex.
[02:25:49.303 --> 02:25:50.083]  I love you, Alex.
[02:25:50.083 --> 02:25:51.905]  I'm sorry for my bad thing in there.
[02:25:51.905 --> 02:25:55.427]  Hey, you're a heavy metal rock star of journalism.
[02:25:55.427 --> 02:25:57.789]  I just wanted to tell you that.
[02:25:57.789 --> 02:26:07.516]  I want to talk about the absurdity of the propagandist media, which has gone off the deep end with pro-child trafficking.
[02:26:07.516 --> 02:26:08.677]  And also, I want to talk about
[02:26:09.389 --> 02:26:09.910]  QAnon
[02:26:29.600 --> 02:26:30.240]  Under the bus.
[02:26:30.240 --> 02:26:31.421]  They want to cover it up.
[02:26:31.421 --> 02:26:32.882]  They always talk about QAnon.
[02:26:32.882 --> 02:26:41.786]  QAnon takes real things and then adds a bunch of BS to them to be discrediting.
[02:26:41.786 --> 02:26:47.109]  That's why I started the neo-anonymous, the new anonymous on Substack.
[02:26:47.109 --> 02:26:51.851]  It's nickanonymous.substack.com.
[02:26:51.851 --> 02:26:54.573]  And I just wrote an article about Sound of Freedom, actually.
[02:26:54.573 --> 02:26:56.814]  And I talk about Hunter S. Thompson.
[02:26:57.646 --> 02:26:58.106]  I think so.
[02:27:13.914 --> 02:27:21.097]  It's some QAnon conspiracy that Adrenochrome isn't a thing and that it doesn't exist when it's right in our face.
[02:27:21.097 --> 02:27:22.057]  It's always right in our face.
[02:27:22.057 --> 02:27:30.321]  Well his lawyer paid him in Adrenochrome, who was a Satanist, and he later admitted that he did pay him in Adrenochrome.
[02:27:30.321 --> 02:27:38.704]  And look, look, I think it's more of a metaphor and some of the Satanists and Black Sabbathists do drink blood and torture children and all the rest of this, but
[02:27:39.864 --> 02:27:45.987]  It's more a metaphor of sucking the soul and the innocence out of children as a metaphor for the spiritualness of it.
[02:27:45.987 --> 02:27:49.629]  Like, I don't believe there's an actual Dracula, but it's a spirit like that.
[02:27:49.629 --> 02:27:51.930]  Does that make sense?
[02:27:51.930 --> 02:27:55.251]  Well, it's that, and there's an actual science to it, too.
[02:27:55.251 --> 02:27:58.753]  The adrenal gland, when people are terrified and they're scared,
[02:27:59.706 --> 02:28:04.328]  Your adrenal gland pumps out adrenochromia.
[02:28:04.328 --> 02:28:08.870]  No, David, I first put this out 33 years ago, put it on my show 29 years ago.
[02:28:08.870 --> 02:28:14.293]  No, I know and I believe, David, I believe that they do drink the blood of terrified children.
[02:28:14.293 --> 02:28:15.213]  Jimmy Savile did that.
[02:28:15.213 --> 02:28:19.955]  I mean, it's in BBC News that he worked there, by the way, that he would torture children and drink their blood.
[02:28:19.955 --> 02:28:22.797]  I mean, this is Prince Charles' best friend.
[02:28:22.797 --> 02:28:24.658]  Yeah, Jimmy Savile's a monster.
[02:28:24.658 --> 02:28:27.339]  He was in the media and he was
[02:28:28.586 --> 02:28:34.771]  Everybody's best friend in the UK, and he was showcased as a hero, a journalist.
[02:28:34.771 --> 02:28:36.713]  He was a journalist for how many years?
[02:28:36.713 --> 02:28:39.995]  And now we find out he's a pedophile.
[02:28:39.995 --> 02:28:42.477]  Well, it was years ago by now.
[02:28:42.477 --> 02:28:45.340]  He was beyond a pedophile.
[02:28:45.340 --> 02:28:52.365]  He would be there when children were dying at the hospital, and they reportedly have sex with them after they were dead, but he would do it while they were alive.
[02:28:52.365 --> 02:28:53.906]  Thank you so much for the call.
[02:28:53.906 --> 02:28:55.588]  But according to CNN, none of this exists.
[02:28:57.967 --> 02:29:04.309]  The globalists aren't just targeting us through the poison shots or the electromagnetic 5G or the GMO crops.
[02:29:04.309 --> 02:29:10.751]  They're hitting us with hundreds of chemicals that the EPA has authorized companies and industry to use.
[02:29:10.751 --> 02:29:14.112]  One of the top pesticides used is Atrazine.
[02:29:14.112 --> 02:29:23.275]  The allowable level the government admits that they allow to be in your water supply is enough to sterilize you and basically turn your son into a feminized mutant.
[02:29:23.275 --> 02:29:23.715]  Look it up.
[02:29:24.355 --> 02:29:25.716]  Don't let them do this to your family.
[02:29:25.716 --> 02:29:28.937]  We have the very best gravity-fed filter system out there.
[02:29:28.937 --> 02:29:32.079]  Highest rated at half the price of leading competitors.
[02:29:32.079 --> 02:29:34.380]  The Alexa Pure, ready to ship to you right now.
[02:29:34.380 --> 02:29:37.181]  We have replacement filters for folks who have already gotten it.
[02:29:37.181 --> 02:29:38.622]  It does 10,000 gallons before you replace them.
[02:29:38.622 --> 02:29:39.602]  It is amazing.
[02:29:39.602 --> 02:29:41.243]  It's great for your home, your business.
[02:29:41.243 --> 02:29:44.464]  You can put swamp water in it, tap water, well water.
[02:29:44.464 --> 02:29:45.885]  Almost everything is contaminated.
[02:29:45.885 --> 02:29:49.647]  This is how you take control of the fluids in your body and counter the globalist onslaught.
[02:29:49.887 --> 02:29:52.327]  Get yours today at Infowarshore.com for a limited time.
[02:29:52.327 --> 02:29:53.928]  We're running a 10% discount.
[02:29:53.928 --> 02:29:56.308]  That is a huge discount to start at the lowest price out there.
[02:29:56.308 --> 02:29:57.969]  You need this filter.
[02:29:57.969 --> 02:30:06.150]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, is a historic book that documents the globalists in their own words, plan for our future.
[02:30:06.150 --> 02:30:07.610]  That is the hellish future.
[02:30:07.610 --> 02:30:16.532]  Now you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them, be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World at bookstores, Amazon, or Infowarshore.com.
[02:30:17.012 --> 02:30:22.614]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies we got run out.
[02:30:22.614 --> 02:30:25.195]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[02:30:25.195 --> 02:30:30.576]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and The War for the World, a signed copy, at InfoWarsHorror.com.
[02:30:30.576 --> 02:30:34.517]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[02:30:34.517 --> 02:30:40.399]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book, you'll also know that you help keep InfoWars on the air.
[02:30:40.399 --> 02:30:42.480]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book.
[02:30:43.260 --> 02:30:44.320]  Or unsigned copies.
[02:30:44.320 --> 02:30:54.684]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to InfoWarsTore.com and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate them to the library or give them to the local school.
[02:30:54.684 --> 02:30:55.704]  This is an InfoWars.
[02:30:55.704 --> 02:30:57.585]  I'm counting on you and thank you for your support.
[02:30:57.585 --> 02:31:03.967]  InfoWars is a one-of-a-kind operation and so please go to InfoWarsTore and just make a donation.
[02:31:03.967 --> 02:31:05.587]  And you can make it one time or recurring.
[02:31:05.587 --> 02:31:08.068]  You have a little profile there, cancel anytime.
[02:31:09.019 --> 02:31:13.368]  Every 15 days, every month, every three months, every six months, up to nine months.
[02:31:14.344 --> 02:31:18.166]  You can go in and every month or every week, whenever you want, you program it.
[02:31:18.166 --> 02:31:21.128]  You just click it and then you decide when you want to make a donation.
[02:31:21.128 --> 02:31:22.209]  So please do that as well.
[02:31:22.209 --> 02:31:24.850]  That way we get 95% of it after credit card fees.
[02:31:24.850 --> 02:31:27.452]  Instead of making 20, 30, 40% like we do on the products.
[02:31:27.452 --> 02:31:29.053]  But these really are amazing products.
[02:31:29.053 --> 02:31:30.794]  The big July 4th sale is going on right now.
[02:31:30.794 --> 02:31:33.756]  This is such a critical platform in the fight against the New World Order.
[02:31:33.756 --> 02:31:35.757]  The enemies out in the open were vindicated.
[02:31:35.757 --> 02:31:37.158]  People are listening more than ever.
[02:31:37.158 --> 02:31:39.259]  But in this major recession going into depression,
[02:31:39.819 --> 02:31:42.242]  And with supply chain breakdowns, I know it's hard.
[02:31:42.242 --> 02:31:43.164]  I know times are tough.
[02:31:43.164 --> 02:31:44.585]  So thank you for your support.
[02:31:44.585 --> 02:31:48.430]  But whatever you do, pray for the broadcast and share the articles and the videos.
[02:31:48.430 --> 02:31:49.732]  That you can do for free.
[02:31:49.732 --> 02:31:51.895]  And that's just as important as keeping us on air.
[02:31:51.895 --> 02:31:55.139]  So however God leads you in your heart to support us, please support us now.
[02:31:55.139 --> 02:31:56.241]  And I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
[02:31:56.801 --> 02:31:57.241]  God bless you.
[02:32:15.854 --> 02:32:24.819]  If you really want to treat yourself to something nice, get yourself an Alexa Pure water filter and get clean, healthy water whenever you want it, wherever you want it.
[02:32:24.819 --> 02:32:31.063]  Even if the water pressure goes out, the Gravity Fed water filter has got you covered.
[02:32:31.063 --> 02:32:31.623]  Absolutely.
[02:32:34.292 --> 02:32:37.095]  Couldn't do any of this without listener support.
[02:32:37.095 --> 02:32:39.917]  I was telling Greg earlier, we're like the real NPR.
[02:32:39.917 --> 02:32:41.639]  The real NPR of The Based Right.
[02:32:41.639 --> 02:32:44.682]  So click that QR code right there on your screen right now.
[02:32:44.682 --> 02:32:45.643]  Take out your phone.
[02:32:45.643 --> 02:32:46.744]  Click that QR code.
[02:32:46.744 --> 02:32:48.906]  It'll take you directly to InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:32:48.906 --> 02:32:49.826]  Buy something.
[02:32:49.826 --> 02:32:50.907]  Support the InfoWar.
[02:32:50.907 --> 02:32:55.331]  Keep Alex Jones, Orange Foyer, Harrison Smith, Greg Reese, Adam King, and the rest of us on air.
[02:32:55.331 --> 02:32:56.132]  Do it today!
[02:32:56.132 --> 02:32:56.973]  Do it now!
[02:32:56.973 --> 02:32:57.774]  Support the InfoWar!
[02:32:59.082 --> 02:33:03.706]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:33:03.706 --> 02:33:20.680]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:20.680 --> 02:33:25.083]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[02:33:25.083 --> 02:33:26.525]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:27.455 --> 02:33:31.436]  All right, let me say something, and then go right back to your phone calls.
[02:33:31.436 --> 02:33:38.479]  I was walking down the hall during the break, and it just hit me.
[02:33:38.479 --> 02:33:41.520]  The whole world is InfoWars now.
[02:33:41.520 --> 02:33:46.142]  You go back to this broadcast 29 years ago, and you'd tune into it, and you'd say, this is crazy.
[02:33:46.142 --> 02:33:48.803]  But I was just going off what the globalists were planning and what they'd already done.
[02:33:48.803 --> 02:33:53.104]  And so many other experts were tracking what they were doing.
[02:33:53.104 --> 02:33:54.225]  It's not about the credit.
[02:33:55.717 --> 02:34:20.511]  It's about that, wow, open world government, open cashless society, open sexualization of children everywhere, pedophile drag queen time, Democrats passing laws in places like California, where they can have sex with 12-year-old kids, they can give people HIV, massive defunding of police, just insanity!
[02:34:20.511 --> 02:34:23.813]  The sexual dismemberment of children,
[02:34:25.629 --> 02:34:28.070]  The mutilation is just insane.
[02:34:28.070 --> 02:34:30.331]  And they're only getting started.
[02:34:30.331 --> 02:34:36.354]  While they simultaneously deny what they're doing, there's no world government, there's no planning around the border.
[02:34:36.354 --> 02:34:38.395]  While the border's the most controlled it's ever been!
[02:34:38.395 --> 02:34:44.758]  And it gets crazier and crazier.
[02:34:44.758 --> 02:34:48.560]  The biggest thing I gotta remember is that I'm my biggest problem.
[02:34:48.560 --> 02:34:51.381]  Of course, aren't we all our own biggest problems?
[02:34:51.381 --> 02:34:54.643]  When I plug every hour, with the great products we have,
[02:34:56.343 --> 02:34:58.325]  We have the funds.
[02:34:58.325 --> 02:35:00.267]  We need to operate.
[02:35:00.267 --> 02:35:01.548]  But when I don't, we don't.
[02:35:01.548 --> 02:35:04.952]  So we've kind of dug out of our hole again.
[02:35:04.952 --> 02:35:08.735]  You notice suddenly I'm not plugging a bunch because, well, they told me, OK, there's enough money now or not.
[02:35:08.735 --> 02:35:09.596]  We can pay the bills.
[02:35:09.596 --> 02:35:11.018]  I need to get a reserve.
[02:35:11.018 --> 02:35:12.379]  I need to hire more reporters.
[02:35:12.379 --> 02:35:13.380]  We need to expand.
[02:35:13.380 --> 02:35:14.942]  Plus, we got great products you need.
[02:35:16.533 --> 02:35:27.821]  And if you will just get excited about those products and find out how amazing they are, what they can do for you, and go there and routinely shop at InfoWareStore.com, we will continue to change the world together.
[02:35:27.821 --> 02:35:33.225]  Today's the last day to get up to 60% off on products at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:35:33.225 --> 02:35:34.907]  We're going to extend the free shipping.
[02:35:35.967 --> 02:35:36.167]  I don't
[02:36:01.667 --> 02:36:03.529]  Down and out sleep aid.
[02:36:03.529 --> 02:36:06.652]  All at InfoWarStore.com or just make a straight donation.
[02:36:07.355 --> 02:36:10.998]  Where it says donate, if you believe in what we're doing and want to see more of it.
[02:36:10.998 --> 02:36:15.761]  That way we get 95%, after the credit card fee, of the money you actually give.
[02:36:15.761 --> 02:36:16.922]  One time or recurring.
[02:36:16.922 --> 02:36:18.784]  Thank you for your support.
[02:36:18.784 --> 02:36:19.845]  The ball is in your court.
[02:36:19.845 --> 02:36:20.605]  Thank you.
[02:36:20.605 --> 02:36:21.606]  And the crew thanks you as well.
[02:36:21.606 --> 02:36:24.528]  Because they're dedicated and want this fight to continue.
[02:36:24.528 --> 02:36:26.890]  All right, let's go in the order these calls are received.
[02:36:26.890 --> 02:36:29.672]  I'm trying to move quick, just make your point with the next person.
[02:36:29.672 --> 02:36:32.454]  Let's go to Joshua in Texas.
[02:36:32.454 --> 02:36:33.275]  Thanks for holding, go ahead.
[02:36:34.997 --> 02:36:37.178]  Hey Alex, thank you for taking my call.
[02:36:37.178 --> 02:36:39.119]  My name is Joshua Abraham.
[02:36:39.119 --> 02:36:52.667]  I am the son of Larry Abraham, who wrote the international best-selling book, None Dare Call a Conspiracy, and you're well aware of my father's work, and I was a guest on your show back in 2012.
[02:36:52.667 --> 02:36:56.029]  Now, I recently moved you to Texas from my house in Beverly Hills.
[02:36:56.747 --> 02:37:08.724]  And for eight years over there I infiltrated Freemasonry up to the 33rd degree and saw the four holy books of the Scottish Rite of the 33rd degree and was told the Masonic secret.
[02:37:08.724 --> 02:37:10.366]  Since I've been here in Texas,
[02:37:11.306 --> 02:37:15.489]  All I've heard is that this is a from your channels that this is a globalist problem.
[02:37:15.489 --> 02:37:17.070]  This is globalism.
[02:37:17.070 --> 02:37:20.892]  I can fully I'm only two hours away from you, Jones.
[02:37:20.892 --> 02:37:27.196]  And I would like to come on your show and take you on and debate you how this is not a globalist problem.
[02:37:27.196 --> 02:37:30.178]  All this child trafficking, the borders open.
[02:37:30.178 --> 02:37:32.439]  This is a pure satanic
[02:37:32.992 --> 02:37:33.392]  We're good.
[02:37:53.362 --> 02:37:56.964]  The Zionist Israeli Mossad is doing this to us.
[02:37:56.964 --> 02:38:03.689]  So if you would allow me to come on your program, I would love to debate you how this is not globalism.
[02:38:03.689 --> 02:38:05.450]  This is Zionism.
[02:38:05.450 --> 02:38:06.531]  Full and through.
[02:38:06.531 --> 02:38:07.892]  I have all the articles.
[02:38:07.892 --> 02:38:12.595]  I tried to go to Project Barakas about my masonic infiltration.
[02:38:12.595 --> 02:38:17.118]  I signed their informant contract, which I still have and I can prove that to you and I can bring it.
[02:38:17.714 --> 02:38:24.982]  But Project Veritas, their board, decided to turn down my case because, and I quote, it's a rabbit hole we don't want to go down.
[02:38:24.982 --> 02:38:26.104]  Okay, well can I talk now?
[02:38:26.104 --> 02:38:28.627]  Absolutely.
[02:38:28.627 --> 02:38:29.588]  Okay, well thank you very much.
[02:38:31.713 --> 02:38:36.675]  I do remember you, and I do know your dad co-wrote that book with Gary Allen that's a seminal, very important book.
[02:38:36.675 --> 02:38:45.018]  I do remember interviewing you, and then I remember just getting some weird feedback, or you were mad at us or something, and I really still don't pay attention to that stuff.
[02:38:45.018 --> 02:38:47.078]  I got a lot of stuff going on.
[02:38:47.078 --> 02:38:51.460]  And I know that going back to Solomon's Temple, Masonry and all that's pretty much the same deal.
[02:38:51.460 --> 02:38:56.822]  It goes back to Egypt, but the Babylonians, it was all basically the same mystery religions of all those groups.
[02:38:57.742 --> 02:39:03.706]  I know about George Washington's writings about the bad guys taking over masonry and the rest of it.
[02:39:03.706 --> 02:39:07.289]  So there's different arms of this system.
[02:39:07.289 --> 02:39:14.914]  And you know, you've seen Kanye West here on the show, you know, going off on his Hitler thing.
[02:39:14.914 --> 02:39:16.535]  I disagree with that.
[02:39:16.535 --> 02:39:19.237]  And of course, I think Hitler had his own occultic
[02:39:20.799 --> 02:39:27.826]  Competing system to all of this but just because somebody goes and gets involved with different
[02:39:29.697 --> 02:39:32.619]  Masonic organizations and reads the books they've got there.
[02:39:32.619 --> 02:39:35.841]  I've not been in those Masonic halls, but I know they've got big libraries.
[02:39:35.841 --> 02:39:39.603]  I've read books about what they have and it's all sorts of stuff from black magic to you.
[02:39:39.603 --> 02:39:48.629]  It's like a suppository or repository of all the forbidden stuff the church wouldn't let you have.
[02:39:48.629 --> 02:39:51.790]  Because it predates the Christian church, the Orthodox, and
[02:39:52.850 --> 02:39:54.431]  Catholic Church.
[02:39:54.431 --> 02:39:56.773]  And so that's what it's got.
[02:39:56.773 --> 02:39:57.533]  So absolutely.
[02:39:57.533 --> 02:40:01.516]  I mean, I know they've got satanic manuscripts, you name it.
[02:40:01.516 --> 02:40:07.260]  We've gotten reporters in that we paid before to get into the Getty archives.
[02:40:07.260 --> 02:40:08.521]  And we did reports on that.
[02:40:08.521 --> 02:40:10.883]  So I've done some of the similar things.
[02:40:10.883 --> 02:40:16.026]  If you came to my house, I don't think in the house I live in now because I've read those books so long ago that they're in storage.
[02:40:16.026 --> 02:40:19.689]  But I mean, I've got like grand grimoire, black magic books.
[02:40:19.689 --> 02:40:21.430]  I've got Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf.
[02:40:22.348 --> 02:40:26.272]  I've got, you know, book stuff written by Julius Caesar.
[02:40:26.272 --> 02:40:28.433]  I've got writings of Napoleon Bonaparte.
[02:40:28.433 --> 02:40:31.656]  In fact, I was going to read some of Napoleon Bonaparte's writings today, but I ran out of time.
[02:40:31.656 --> 02:40:33.638]  I actually have them right here.
[02:40:33.638 --> 02:40:36.300]  But that doesn't mean I agree with Napoleon Bonaparte's writings.
[02:40:36.300 --> 02:40:40.363]  And by the way, I'm not an apologist for the Masons.
[02:40:40.363 --> 02:40:45.107]  If the Masons claim that they tried to found this country and they're trying to save freedom, they've really been asleep on the job.
[02:40:46.505 --> 02:41:01.908]  And so when you say, globalism is what the globalist Anglo-American British combine US MI6 slash Israel's a spinoff, Mossad CIA combine calls itself.
[02:41:01.908 --> 02:41:04.288]  So globalists want a global government run by them.
[02:41:04.288 --> 02:41:06.749]  It doesn't mean they're internationalist.
[02:41:06.749 --> 02:41:08.569]  It doesn't even mean they're a citizen of the world.
[02:41:08.569 --> 02:41:10.049]  That all sounds interesting.
[02:41:10.049 --> 02:41:14.890]  They are wanting a centralized world government
[02:41:15.470 --> 02:41:19.835]  And I guess they taught you at this lodge the secret is that Lucifer is the Morning Star.
[02:41:19.835 --> 02:41:23.980]  And of course they refer to Christ in the Bible as the Morning Star as well.
[02:41:23.980 --> 02:41:25.601]  And you know, all the rest of that.
[02:41:25.601 --> 02:41:28.865]  So you're welcome to talk about that stuff.
[02:41:28.865 --> 02:41:31.748]  But just calling up and saying you want to debate with me, skip this break.
[02:41:32.409 --> 02:41:42.973]  Just by calling up and saying you want a debate with me, I'm not going to let you define the parameters of what that debate is because I don't think I'm even debating what you're saying.
[02:41:42.973 --> 02:41:50.816]  If you want to put a written report together with some images in it or something you're talking about and email it to us, I might be interested in talking to you.
[02:41:50.816 --> 02:41:59.040]  But not if I'm being beaten over the head that I'm covering things up and you're the anointed one that's going to... So that's where I'm at.
[02:41:59.040 --> 02:41:59.780]  Do you want to respond now?
[02:42:01.149 --> 02:42:08.016]  Yeah, I never said I was the anointed one, even though you called me that on your 2012 interview.
[02:42:08.016 --> 02:42:09.757]  Well, I called you the anointed one.
[02:42:09.757 --> 02:42:10.238]  Oh, really?
[02:42:10.238 --> 02:42:11.379]  Wow, we're learning more here.
[02:42:11.379 --> 02:42:13.681]  Okay, so please, and I called you the Easter Bunny, too.
[02:42:13.681 --> 02:42:14.382]  So, what else?
[02:42:14.382 --> 02:42:15.222]  No, no, no, I didn't call you that.
[02:42:15.222 --> 02:42:16.003]  I'm done talking.
[02:42:16.003 --> 02:42:16.804]  I'm done talking.
[02:42:16.804 --> 02:42:17.464]  I'm done talking.
[02:42:17.464 --> 02:42:18.505]  Thanks for the call.
[02:42:18.505 --> 02:42:20.307]  I gotta get to everybody else, man.
[02:42:20.307 --> 02:42:26.013]  I mean, I just, there's always these personalities that don't want to talk about the information.
[02:42:26.894 --> 02:42:30.323]  I mean, are a bunch of the Masonic Lodges worshipping Lucifer?
[02:42:30.323 --> 02:42:31.226]  Yeah.
[02:42:31.226 --> 02:42:32.288]  Is that the 33rd degree?
[02:42:32.288 --> 02:42:34.454]  Or even the 32nd degree?
[02:42:34.454 --> 02:42:34.635]  Yeah.
[02:42:35.481 --> 02:42:36.421]  Okay?
[02:42:36.421 --> 02:42:38.742]  And that's the whole paradox of the thing.
[02:42:38.742 --> 02:42:44.183]  And then there's all these idiots online that go, Alex Jones did this with his hand, that's an Illuminati symbol.
[02:42:44.183 --> 02:42:51.446]  No, you put your index finger with your thumb, it's known psychologically and in studies to make your brainwaves even operate better.
[02:42:51.446 --> 02:42:54.866]  Or like when you squeeze your fist together, it makes you think of fighting.
[02:42:54.866 --> 02:43:01.128]  The rainbow is in Genesis as God's promise not to destroy the earth again with water.
[02:43:01.128 --> 02:43:03.529]  People ask, you made a NASA shirt, it has a rainbow on it.
[02:43:04.724 --> 02:43:08.127]  It's a copy of a NASA shirt from the 70s.
[02:43:08.127 --> 02:43:09.928]  The rainbow is not bad.
[02:43:09.928 --> 02:43:13.251]  I will use it if I want to.
[02:43:13.251 --> 02:43:21.959]  And so again, you go off the fruits of what somebody does, you go off what they promote, which is freedom, and then everything we do is not occulted.
[02:43:21.959 --> 02:43:23.480]  Nothing we do here is hidden.
[02:43:25.154 --> 02:43:26.235]  My name is Alex Jones.
[02:43:26.235 --> 02:43:27.336]  That's my real name.
[02:43:27.336 --> 02:43:28.978]  What we cover is real issues.
[02:43:28.978 --> 02:43:32.161]  Well, you can go check out almost everything we talk about and we do here.
[02:43:32.161 --> 02:43:34.264]  When I'm giving you opinion, I'll tell you it's opinion.
[02:43:34.264 --> 02:43:44.054]  So I'm not gonna, when a call comes out, I am the son of this, and this is the way this is, and I want to debate you, and you are going to such and such, all the rest of it.
[02:43:45.612 --> 02:43:49.053]  And see, I just vaguely remember all that stuff, and I just can't handle it.
[02:43:49.053 --> 02:43:55.516]  I've been around too much craziness, and I just, I do my show, I do my research, I go home to my family, and that's it.
[02:43:55.516 --> 02:43:57.857]  I don't even really hang out with people anymore, any of that.
[02:43:57.857 --> 02:44:03.860]  I'm just, I'm like a hermit or something that just carries out the mission, and that's it.
[02:44:03.860 --> 02:44:05.280]  All right, appreciate your call.
[02:44:05.280 --> 02:44:07.321]  All right, Peter in Puerto Rico.
[02:44:07.321 --> 02:44:08.241]  Thanks for holding, go ahead.
[02:44:08.241 --> 02:44:10.402]  Hi, hello.
[02:44:10.402 --> 02:44:11.783]  Thank you, Alex, for taking the call.
[02:44:12.559 --> 02:44:14.680]  I'm here in Puerto Rico, Jalco.
[02:44:14.680 --> 02:44:17.100]  I want to talk about like generally human trafficking.
[02:44:17.100 --> 02:44:18.120]  Yes.
[02:44:18.120 --> 02:44:23.001]  You saw Haiti, the Dominican Republic, which is owned by the EU and NATO.
[02:44:23.001 --> 02:44:30.303]  Cuba, which is Russia, which you won't see any news from it because of like the great firewall that prevents any information from coming here.
[02:44:30.303 --> 02:44:34.303]  And then the silent place, Puerto Rico, that's owned by the Democratic Party.
[02:44:34.303 --> 02:44:36.904]  That's been like that since like the mid 50s.
[02:44:36.904 --> 02:44:41.805]  We've been voting for the same unit party for decades, almost generations worth.
[02:44:42.415 --> 02:44:43.816]  Of people.
[02:44:43.816 --> 02:44:49.681]  You make children, you get paid for it through the social security system, those kids disappear.
[02:44:49.681 --> 02:44:52.103]  Nobody ever bats an eye about it.
[02:44:52.103 --> 02:45:11.859]  Women, children, whole bunch of people here disappear through concerts, vicariously through hotels, which is usually the more larger facet, or LGBT, I guess, conditioning, because we're, you know, since CNN says that sex trafficking is not real, but I think you can re-educate children, right?
[02:45:12.549 --> 02:45:14.909]  So, re-education or LGBT+.
[02:45:14.909 --> 02:45:15.730]  Well, that's right.
[02:45:15.730 --> 02:45:22.851]  The whole LGBT thing and all the TSA-groping kids, psychologists admit, is priming them for sex abuse.
[02:45:22.851 --> 02:45:23.491]  Indeed.
[02:45:23.491 --> 02:45:32.693]  And over here, there's tourism for that, or adults only, or with children, LGBT pro plus areas, or gay tourism.
[02:45:32.693 --> 02:45:35.873]  It's another form and facet of sex tourism.
[02:45:35.873 --> 02:45:39.254]  You know, come to the island, spend your big money, have
[02:45:40.700 --> 02:45:41.700]  Well, that's right.
[02:46:02.981 --> 02:46:08.606]  I mean, it's come out that a lot of the Democrats, particularly, used the Caribbean for this, and we know about it.
[02:46:08.606 --> 02:46:09.807]  It came out.
[02:46:09.807 --> 02:46:14.931]  Of course, it's in Tim Ballard's powerful film, The Sound of Freedom, real stories.
[02:46:14.931 --> 02:46:16.172]  They used islands there.
[02:46:16.172 --> 02:46:17.072]  We know about Little St.
[02:46:17.072 --> 02:46:18.914]  John's, real islands there.
[02:46:18.914 --> 02:46:29.362]  And so, I've read that about Puerto Rico, that it's really bad, and because they control the police and other things, children just disappear, and it's something that you know to keep on the DL.
[02:46:29.362 --> 02:46:32.505]  It's kind of like, we call it here, the invisible crime.
[02:46:33.446 --> 02:46:36.607]  Uh, everybody knows about it, but nobody can see it, right?
[02:46:36.607 --> 02:46:39.369]  Everyone's people kind of just vanishes.
[02:46:39.369 --> 02:46:44.171]  Little girls, kids, adult teenage men, adult teenage girls.
[02:46:44.171 --> 02:46:51.094]  And then what happens is that, you know, they end up giving excuses that they get found in the United States and then you just never hear about them again.
[02:46:51.094 --> 02:46:53.555]  You know, complete families are just destroyed.
[02:46:53.555 --> 02:46:55.735]  Oh, my child left of the United States.
[02:46:55.735 --> 02:46:56.956]  Nobody bats an eye about it.
[02:46:57.737 --> 02:47:00.258]  Entire groups of people just being vanished.
[02:47:00.258 --> 02:47:02.419]  There's towns here... And you claim, oh, they ran away.
[02:47:02.419 --> 02:47:07.060]  Well, I mean, that's how the UN did it, and that's how these big... It's the same thing you see in the Sound of Freedom.
[02:47:07.060 --> 02:47:08.841]  This has been going on forever.
[02:47:08.841 --> 02:47:16.104]  They'll tell, like, an 11-year-old girl at school, at, you know, the local soda shop or whatever in Eastern Europe, hey, you want money?
[02:47:16.104 --> 02:47:16.764]  You want a job?
[02:47:16.764 --> 02:47:18.825]  There's a beauty pageant today at this hotel.
[02:47:18.825 --> 02:47:20.185]  Come here.
[02:47:20.185 --> 02:47:21.106]  And then they do the same thing.
[02:47:21.106 --> 02:47:22.786]  Take pictures of them, get them ready.
[02:47:22.786 --> 02:47:23.346]  Boom.
[02:47:23.346 --> 02:47:24.047]  Drug them.
[02:47:24.047 --> 02:47:25.527]  Put them in a truck.
[02:47:25.527 --> 02:47:26.768]  Fly them out on a private jet.
[02:47:26.768 --> 02:47:27.368]  They are gone.
[02:47:28.246 --> 02:47:29.948]  And the ones that go along with it live.
[02:47:29.948 --> 02:47:37.215]  The big dirty secret is they kill a large portion of the kids that don't go along.
[02:47:37.215 --> 02:47:39.076]  Well, because, you know, people are resistant to that.
[02:47:39.076 --> 02:47:40.718]  That's the light of God.
[02:47:40.718 --> 02:47:41.959]  Like, people don't want to do that.
[02:47:41.959 --> 02:47:43.561]  That's the stealing of innocence.
[02:47:43.561 --> 02:47:46.463]  That's why the gay bomb was first dropped on the church.
[02:47:46.463 --> 02:47:51.328]  If you can diselude people to the fact that pedophilia equals church, right?
[02:47:51.328 --> 02:47:53.330]  Everyone makes the tackle, like priests do.
[02:47:54.705 --> 02:47:59.647]  If we can, if we can connect the most atrocious thing that you can do to a human... No, that's it!
[02:47:59.647 --> 02:48:01.869]  That's how they take over every... Boy Scouts!
[02:48:01.869 --> 02:48:10.753]  I remember ten years ago, they were handing out condoms to even eight-year-olds at the, quote, Jubilee of the Boy Scouts, and then it bankrupted the Boy Scouts and got taken over!
[02:48:10.753 --> 02:48:12.374]  That was a total plan!
[02:48:12.374 --> 02:48:16.696]  And that's all this LGBTPS thing is, is a Trojan horse!
[02:48:17.954 --> 02:48:20.116]  I'm 30, you know, I'm in my mid-30s.
[02:48:20.116 --> 02:48:23.598]  I saw this through the Catholic Church in my local area.
[02:48:23.598 --> 02:48:26.139]  You know, you start seeing scandals, right?
[02:48:26.139 --> 02:48:28.201]  Like, oh, these priests touch this, this priest touch that.
[02:48:28.201 --> 02:48:31.863]  And there was, like, generally new priests, people who came into the area.
[02:48:31.863 --> 02:48:33.984]  Sure, nobody's asking, why are they getting recruited?
[02:48:33.984 --> 02:48:34.845]  Who's bringing them in?
[02:48:34.845 --> 02:48:35.786]  Who's protecting them?
[02:48:35.786 --> 02:48:37.206]  Why are they moving them around?
[02:48:37.206 --> 02:48:38.587]  And they're there to destroy the church.
[02:48:38.587 --> 02:48:39.908]  I agree with you.
[02:48:39.908 --> 02:48:45.792]  But I am seeing a lot of people, from what I've read, I've never been to Puerto Rico, I'd like to visit sometime, that people are starting to wake up in Puerto Rico.
[02:48:46.733 --> 02:48:49.795]  Oh dude, this has been the Republican nation.
[02:48:49.795 --> 02:48:53.777]  We have a holiday, the 27th of July, Barbosa Day.
[02:48:53.777 --> 02:48:58.460]  It was a doctor who was in the mid-18th century and he died in 1920.
[02:48:58.460 --> 02:49:03.963]  He was the spearhead of what statehood or Republican nationalism for Puerto Rico is.
[02:49:03.963 --> 02:49:05.524]  We do not like democracy.
[02:49:05.524 --> 02:49:07.365]  That is mob rule.
[02:49:07.365 --> 02:49:11.327]  That is who has the most, who has the voice, and who yells the loudest.
[02:49:11.327 --> 02:49:15.730]  And then the minority and the people who suffer the most are dragging the chains.
[02:49:16.664 --> 02:49:21.487]  Those who worship the hierarchy, or the oligarchy of Europe.
[02:49:21.487 --> 02:49:24.468]  Or the Olden family, the Vanderbilt family.
[02:49:24.468 --> 02:49:26.029]  Got to jump, great points.
[02:49:26.029 --> 02:49:30.571]  Carlos in Houston, thanks for holding your ear on the air.
[02:49:30.571 --> 02:49:32.813]  Alex, it's always good to talk to you.
[02:49:32.813 --> 02:49:36.194]  I saw the movie, it was very riveting.
[02:49:36.194 --> 02:49:44.539]  I also saw a freaking interview where Jim Caviezel was talking with
[02:49:45.802 --> 02:49:52.205]  With the other buddy with the same show called The War Room, like Owen, what's his name?
[02:49:52.205 --> 02:49:53.225]  Steve Bannon?
[02:49:53.225 --> 02:49:56.086]  Steve Bannon.
[02:49:56.086 --> 02:50:12.333]  And they were talking about, he was making, I don't know if assertions or maybe he's seen some data that was collected by that team that's been rescuing all these kids, but they were talking about how
[02:50:13.181 --> 02:50:22.086]  Whenever the kids are killed, a lot of that biological material ends up in all these different biolabs, which you alluded to earlier.
[02:50:22.086 --> 02:50:31.191]  And also, they've heard the word ambrosia in the past, which is what they call adrenochrome.
[02:50:31.191 --> 02:50:35.354]  Adrenochrome is a term for the pituitary gland or the adrenal gland, the blood of that.
[02:50:36.839 --> 02:50:43.764]  Ambrosia is an ancient term for drinking blood of children that was done in black Sabbaths and black masses.
[02:50:43.764 --> 02:50:48.167]  So that's in thousand-year-old satanic books.
[02:50:48.167 --> 02:50:55.693]  That's in museums that they would... You see like in vampire movies, Dracula will get a baby,
[02:50:56.357 --> 02:51:02.242]  So the main reason why these people, the media themselves, they're the main ones that are probably more than likely, I'm not accusing anybody, but
[02:51:25.051 --> 02:51:41.437]  That guy that was taking a little osito across the border, he looks like your quintessential example of what a perro looks like and the guy at the beginning of the movie.
[02:51:41.437 --> 02:51:47.779]  Those guys, I don't know where they did their casting at, but they did a wonderful job.
[02:51:47.779 --> 02:51:49.180]  Now, the other part of that is,
[02:51:49.676 --> 02:51:59.282]  Remember, and I heard this on your show probably about eight years ago, the company called Ambrosia.
[02:51:59.282 --> 02:52:02.044]  The one that was... Yeah, that was the one that was going to get blood from kids.
[02:52:02.044 --> 02:52:05.666]  It was going to get blood from kids and give it to people, yeah.
[02:52:05.666 --> 02:52:09.468]  Yes, and so they can't lose that pipeline.
[02:52:09.468 --> 02:52:13.410]  That's the only thing that's keeping these damn mummies alive.
[02:52:13.410 --> 02:52:19.214]  So they have to try to discredit anything that's good, anything that's going against them that's going to take away
[02:52:19.901 --> 02:52:24.382]  That food supply now now my mother-in-law lives in El Paso.
[02:52:24.382 --> 02:52:40.246]  She says that things are the worst that they've been just in the past two or three months and even worse now now says that rule about about them not having to do the blood test on the kids and on the family members.
[02:52:40.246 --> 02:52:43.547]  My mother-in-law says that they are being bombarded and flooded.
[02:52:43.547 --> 02:52:44.847]  There's nowhere to stay.
[02:52:45.963 --> 02:52:47.444]  That's totally, totally broken.
[02:52:47.444 --> 02:52:55.808]  And again, why would Obama, Biden, say... See, my brain is like, I can't... I have real trouble telling lies.
[02:52:55.808 --> 02:52:58.490]  The President is Biden, but it is Obama, so I can't say Biden.
[02:53:00.771 --> 02:53:10.294]  Yeah, because it is Obama, and they literally do not, when they don't even know, like a man shows up with little kids, it doesn't even look like him, there's no ID, they do a test, they don't even do that now!
[02:53:10.294 --> 02:53:12.955]  I mean, that is the government running children!
[02:53:12.955 --> 02:53:19.097]  God bless you brother, I'm sorry to hear about that's happening, and hopefully your mother and people can speak out against it.
[02:53:19.097 --> 02:53:21.558]  It's hard to even take these calls, isn't it?
[02:53:21.558 --> 02:53:25.039]  Can you imagine working down there on the border?
[02:53:25.039 --> 02:53:25.959]  It's just pure evil.
[02:53:25.959 --> 02:53:27.880]  Jason in Texas, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:53:29.133 --> 02:53:30.273]  Hey, Alex.
[02:53:30.273 --> 02:53:30.773]  Yes, sir, go ahead.
[02:53:30.773 --> 02:53:34.834]  I just want to say what a great job, obviously.
[02:53:34.834 --> 02:53:38.475]  I mean, I've talked to you many times, time listener.
[02:53:38.475 --> 02:53:42.115]  Everything you do, it's working out perfectly, all of this.
[02:53:42.115 --> 02:53:44.996]  It's all coming together, just like God has a plan for everything.
[02:53:44.996 --> 02:53:46.096]  I was going to say, it's not us, brother.
[02:53:46.096 --> 02:53:48.717]  The Lord works in mysterious ways.
[02:53:48.717 --> 02:53:49.337]  Absolutely.
[02:53:49.337 --> 02:53:51.777]  I mean, we got these people on the ropes.
[02:53:51.777 --> 02:53:53.358]  They're running scared.
[02:53:53.358 --> 02:53:55.758]  You know, they're doing hit pieces on this movie.
[02:53:56.266 --> 02:53:58.908]  Trying to say it's all phony and conspiracy theory.
[02:53:58.908 --> 02:54:01.909]  They're full of crap and we got them running.
[02:54:01.909 --> 02:54:06.652]  The only thing phony about the movie is that it's a million times worse.
[02:54:06.652 --> 02:54:07.673]  But I'm not attacking the movie.
[02:54:07.673 --> 02:54:09.094]  I would have done it the same way.
[02:54:09.094 --> 02:54:13.817]  Because it's so big, you've got to focus only a few kids to personalize it.
[02:54:13.817 --> 02:54:17.919]  But the only problem with the movie is it's much worse.
[02:54:17.919 --> 02:54:18.459]  Exactly.
[02:54:18.459 --> 02:54:20.521]  I just want to give a quick shout out.
[02:54:21.526 --> 02:54:22.867]  Uh, I called Sunday night.
[02:54:22.867 --> 02:54:24.028]  I talked to Owen.
[02:54:24.028 --> 02:54:25.209]  I want to thank Drew.
[02:54:25.209 --> 02:54:28.412]  I want to thank Henry and I want to thank Ellis.
[02:54:28.412 --> 02:54:29.273]  They helped.
[02:54:29.273 --> 02:54:30.454]  They all helped me out.
[02:54:30.454 --> 02:54:31.915]  I was in speed.
[02:54:31.915 --> 02:54:32.776]  Still kind of am.
[02:54:32.776 --> 02:54:33.817]  I'm still out there.
[02:54:33.817 --> 02:54:35.538]  Jason Lawler, nine.
[02:54:35.538 --> 02:54:37.060]  I'm Ben Mo.
[02:54:37.060 --> 02:54:38.521]  I'm living in my car.
[02:54:38.521 --> 02:54:42.104]  I lost my job to illegal aliens.
[02:54:42.104 --> 02:54:46.828]  And yeah, if long time listener, any info where he wants to help out,
[02:54:47.392 --> 02:54:48.973]  I'm not begging, I'm just asking.
[02:54:48.973 --> 02:54:55.038]  Well that's why we've got to start building communities during the collapse and just say no Satan worshippers allowed.
[02:54:55.038 --> 02:55:02.384]  And under the First Amendment we can form churches that allow us to be only amongst our own people of every race, color, and creed but Christians.
[02:55:02.384 --> 02:55:08.409]  We're going to have to declare it folks and just 100% get with Christians because are you either going to be a Christian or are you going to be with the devil?
[02:55:08.409 --> 02:55:10.430]  That's just the way it's going to be soon.
[02:55:10.430 --> 02:55:12.132]  Thank you Jason.
[02:55:12.132 --> 02:55:13.933]  Let's go to Jared in Missouri.
[02:55:13.933 --> 02:55:14.774]  Thanks for holding, go ahead.
[02:55:15.962 --> 02:55:16.862]  Hey, be honest with me.
[02:55:16.862 --> 02:55:20.003]  How many times did you tear up in that movie?
[02:55:20.003 --> 02:55:21.623]  How many times I what?
[02:55:21.623 --> 02:55:23.304]  Tear up.
[02:55:23.304 --> 02:55:24.664]  Oh, I mean, I teared up a lot.
[02:55:24.664 --> 02:55:29.605]  I'm a big, I mean, it was terrible because I have children and I also know how real all this is.
[02:55:29.605 --> 02:55:31.466]  And I also know they kill a lot of kids.
[02:55:31.466 --> 02:55:35.027]  So I realized as bad as the movie was, it was far worse.
[02:55:35.027 --> 02:55:35.587]  Absolutely.
[02:55:35.587 --> 02:55:41.749]  It's a miracle that, go figure, the name of the studio that came out with it was Angel Studios and how it was going to get buried by Disney.
[02:55:41.749 --> 02:55:43.549]  And I think this is going to be the movie
[02:55:43.996 --> 02:55:44.277]  I don't know.
[02:55:51.863 --> 02:55:55.926]  Like you said, too many numbers, too many things, so it doesn't really personalize it.
[02:55:55.926 --> 02:55:57.627]  I think this movie did an excellent job of that.
[02:55:57.627 --> 02:56:01.130]  I'm going to take my children as well, my two daughters, and I have a son.
[02:56:01.130 --> 02:56:02.551]  We're going to go check it out.
[02:56:02.551 --> 02:56:04.052]  By the way, that's a good point.
[02:56:04.052 --> 02:56:11.678]  Even though this scares children, I think people should take young children as young as five or six to this, because they need to know how dangerous the predators are.
[02:56:11.678 --> 02:56:14.920]  All this pedo-LGBT stuff to train your kids to get kidnapped.
[02:56:15.360 --> 02:56:24.845]  Yeah, there wasn't a dry eye in the theater.
[02:56:24.845 --> 02:56:25.545]  It was packed.
[02:56:25.545 --> 02:56:27.947]  I mean, I know I've heard a lot of people getting, you know, refunded.
[02:56:27.947 --> 02:56:28.467]  Keep fighting.
[02:56:28.467 --> 02:56:31.308]  I recommend everybody who hears my voice to go see the movie.
[02:56:31.308 --> 02:56:32.269]  Spread the word.
[02:56:32.269 --> 02:56:34.310]  Tell people about it, because it really can help.
[02:56:34.310 --> 02:56:41.374]  I think this can bring down the whole thing, man, to be honest with you, because once people start feeling the way we already knew, like I already knew about this stuff myself, too, but
[02:56:42.514 --> 02:56:50.509]  It's definitely a catalyst to break their back, and that's why when you look at CNN, or ABC, or MSNBC, they look scared, don't they?
[02:56:50.509 --> 02:56:50.809]  Yep.
[02:56:50.809 --> 02:56:52.372]  Because they know who they work for.
[02:56:53.160 --> 02:57:05.046]  Yeah, and they also, funny thing is, QAnon didn't even exist when he was doing all this either, so the fact that they have to divert it to that, obviously, the more stuff they say like that, the more I'm interested in actually going and seeing the truth.
[02:57:05.046 --> 02:57:20.333]  Oh yeah, QAnon came along, people would see me on the street and go, I'm with Q, he exposes the Bilderberg group, and I'm like, I was exposed to the Bilderberg group 25 years ago, so they, it was just a way, we'd wake people up, and the CIA had to get a way to get them back, you see.
[02:57:20.993 --> 02:57:21.634]  And that's what they did.
[02:57:21.634 --> 02:57:22.274]  But it doesn't matter.
[02:57:22.274 --> 02:57:23.916]  Everybody knows it's BS now.
[02:57:23.916 --> 02:57:24.196]  All right.
[02:57:24.196 --> 02:57:25.117]  Appreciate your call.
[02:57:25.117 --> 02:57:26.358]  God bless you.
[02:57:26.358 --> 02:57:26.818]  All right.
[02:57:26.818 --> 02:57:33.944]  Paris, Victor, Evan, Stacy, I'm going to take your calls before the next guest host takes over.
[02:57:33.944 --> 02:57:35.446]  Really appreciate the crew.
[02:57:35.446 --> 02:57:36.867]  The fabulous job they've done.
[02:57:36.867 --> 02:57:38.969]  The amazing Kate Daly takes over.
[02:57:38.969 --> 02:57:41.691]  But I'm going to finish up some of your phone calls right now.
[02:57:41.691 --> 02:57:44.594]  InfoWars.com is the coordinates of Liberty.
[02:57:47.981 --> 02:57:57.609]  With all the craziness in the world, the collapsing borders, the war with Russia, the insanity, the currency devaluations, the economy going crazy.
[02:57:57.609 --> 02:58:02.894]  You are crazy in my view if you don't get high quality storable food and water filtration and self-defense.
[02:58:03.334 --> 02:58:05.035]  Now, we're not selling guns and ammo.
[02:58:05.035 --> 02:58:07.997]  That's for you to go out and get for yourself and learn how to use if you haven't.
[02:58:07.997 --> 02:58:09.638]  And I'm preaching the choir on that.
[02:58:09.638 --> 02:58:14.561]  But a lot of people got plenty of guns, but they don't have enough storable food or water filtration.
[02:58:14.561 --> 02:58:16.282]  This is something you need now.
[02:58:16.282 --> 02:58:20.865]  And we've got it in the food department and in the high quality water filtration department.

[02:59:11.060 --> 02:59:12.380]  Only a few hundred bottles left.
[02:59:12.380 --> 02:59:17.763]  But the good news is we have several thousand bottles left of Super Female Vitality that's the same formula.
[02:59:17.763 --> 02:59:18.563]  It boosts men.
[02:59:18.563 --> 02:59:19.563]  It boosts women.
[02:59:19.563 --> 02:59:20.344]  It works great.
[02:59:20.344 --> 02:59:22.224]  But women like pink labels.
[02:59:22.224 --> 02:59:24.185]  Men like different color labels.
[02:59:24.185 --> 02:59:26.206]  So it works for men as well.
[02:59:26.206 --> 02:59:27.266]  It's the same formula.
[02:59:27.266 --> 02:59:28.527]  It's an incredible formula.

[02:59:29.487 --> 02:59:31.188]  And there's another important part of the

[02:59:51.576 --> 02:59:55.518]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:59:58.536 --> 03:00:10.467]  One of the things you've been talking about on your show is your allegation that government officials are aiding in pedophilia, child trafficking, and the grooming of children.
[03:00:10.467 --> 03:00:10.868]  Right?
[03:00:10.868 --> 03:00:11.308]  What do you mean?
[03:00:11.308 --> 03:00:13.610]  Like what Jeffrey Epstein did with the Clintons?
[03:00:23.041 --> 03:00:28.124]  You know, I don't blame people that tune into this show and think it's nuts.
[03:00:28.124 --> 03:00:44.551]  I remember when Ted Gunderson, again, high-level FBI, retired, told me 28 years ago, I've been on there 29 years, 28 years ago, this was all going on, and then since then, 99% of what he said has turned out to be accurate.
[03:00:44.551 --> 03:00:47.312]  The guy has such credibility, what a great patriot.
[03:00:47.312 --> 03:00:48.113]  Imagine being him.
[03:00:49.682 --> 03:00:54.103]  He'd been in the FBI decades before he became the head FBI agent in Los Angeles.
[03:00:54.103 --> 03:00:55.684]  And he didn't believe it when people came to him.
[03:00:55.684 --> 03:00:59.925]  He went to disprove stuff he was told about murderers and devil worshippers and pedophiles.
[03:00:59.925 --> 03:01:01.446]  And he sure found out it was true.
[03:01:01.446 --> 03:01:03.807]  And he was like, what in the world?
[03:01:03.807 --> 03:01:08.908]  And then he suddenly was told, don't look into that.
[03:01:08.908 --> 03:01:10.089]  We don't have the resources for that.
[03:01:10.089 --> 03:01:12.750]  The public can't handle that.
[03:01:12.750 --> 03:01:14.930]  And he started finding out about everything.
[03:01:14.930 --> 03:01:15.751]  Manson and the CIA.
[03:01:17.267 --> 03:01:19.048]  Pentagon running secret operations.
[03:01:19.048 --> 03:01:20.129]  It's all a test.
[03:01:20.129 --> 03:01:26.852]  They use devil worshipping as a model, even though they believe in God, as a psychological model to see if you'll do really bad stuff.
[03:01:26.852 --> 03:01:29.673]  But basically, it's a template.
[03:01:29.673 --> 03:01:35.536]  That's why the organized gangs, the drug gangs, you know, use shaitanism, like MS-13 is a program.
[03:01:35.536 --> 03:01:40.899]  They're trying to see what you're willing to do and it's very real, folks, and it's all come out.
[03:01:40.899 --> 03:01:43.561]  And to see the system desperately trying to block it right now,
[03:01:44.651 --> 03:01:45.551]  is amazing.
[03:01:45.551 --> 03:01:50.293]  Paris in Arizona, thanks for holding her on the air.
[03:01:50.293 --> 03:01:53.054]  Scholar and gentlemen, thank you for everything that you've done.
[03:01:53.054 --> 03:01:55.115]  I know you hate it.
[03:01:55.115 --> 03:02:02.117]  Quick plug, your beard and hair will turn you into a Sasquatch.
[03:02:02.117 --> 03:02:04.758]  You know, the rats are leaving the sinking ship right now.
[03:02:04.758 --> 03:02:05.499]  I know that.
[03:02:05.499 --> 03:02:12.061]  And right now, when anybody is sinking in the water, they reach out for anybody to reach out and grab onto.
[03:02:13.218 --> 03:02:21.044]  I have nothing bad to say about, you know, the Sound of Freedom and what it's promoting in the country, because it's needed right now.
[03:02:21.044 --> 03:02:23.607]  I have a question for you.
[03:02:23.607 --> 03:02:36.597]  There is a gentleman by the name of Carlos Slim that Donald Trump was speaking about at one of his rallies, and does he have any involvement with the movement, with the movement Sound of Freedom?
[03:02:36.597 --> 03:02:37.818]  Do you know anything of that, sir?
[03:02:39.839 --> 03:02:45.922]  I have a pretty good memory, and Carlos Slim at one point was the richest man in the world.
[03:02:45.922 --> 03:02:46.403]  Correct.
[03:02:46.403 --> 03:02:50.485]  That's not his name, he's really Lebanese.
[03:02:50.485 --> 03:03:00.530]  And I've forgotten way more than I've, you know, I've forgotten more than most people know.
[03:03:00.530 --> 03:03:02.872]  But I do know that he supplied the Obama phones to the poor.
[03:03:03.888 --> 03:03:04.689]  And a bunch of other stuff.
[03:03:04.689 --> 03:03:10.674]  So no, I don't know about Carlos Slim's connection to this, to pedophilia.
[03:03:10.674 --> 03:03:15.378]  I mean, I know about his connection to Obama.
[03:03:15.378 --> 03:03:15.898]  Yes, sir.
[03:03:15.898 --> 03:03:24.265]  I see an article here with Donald Trump saying Trump blames Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim for sexual misconduct stories.
[03:03:24.265 --> 03:03:28.609]  If you would look into that and inform people about that, I would really appreciate that.
[03:03:29.190 --> 03:03:33.858]  And I live in Arizona, and I'm heading to the border to film any and everything that I can.
[03:03:33.858 --> 03:03:36.482]  And I've been listening since the Jakari Jackson days.
[03:03:36.482 --> 03:03:40.969]  And if showtips.infoawards.com is still up, I'll send any and everything I can to you.
[03:03:41.545 --> 03:03:42.705]  We need to check that more.
[03:03:42.705 --> 03:03:43.465]  We appreciate you.
[03:03:43.465 --> 03:03:44.786]  Boy, do I love Jakari Jackson.
[03:03:44.786 --> 03:03:49.387]  He ended up meeting the girl of his dreams in South Carolina and she didn't want to move, so that's why he quit.
[03:03:49.387 --> 03:03:53.048]  It was no hard feelings, but man, he was a great reporter and a good friend.
[03:03:53.048 --> 03:03:53.548]  I miss him.
[03:03:53.548 --> 03:03:55.548]  We ought to see how Jakari Jackson's doing.
[03:03:55.548 --> 03:03:56.988]  Thank you so much, sir.
[03:03:56.988 --> 03:03:58.609]  All right, Victor, Evan, and Stacey.
[03:03:58.609 --> 03:04:06.991]  I'm going to go bam, bam, bam very quickly when we come back, and then I'm going to go right to Kate Daly, who always has amazing guests and knocks it out of the park.
[03:04:06.991 --> 03:04:07.731]  And then in one hour,
[03:04:09.142 --> 03:04:14.950]  Owen Schroer with The War Room takes over Central Standard Time.
[03:04:14.950 --> 03:04:21.659]  I kind of went off for the last two hours on Sound of Freedom because, I mean, it takes a lot for me to get blown away by, but...
[03:04:22.731 --> 03:04:29.553]  The corporate press is attacking and basically saying child sex slavery is not an issue.
[03:04:29.553 --> 03:04:31.413]  They're nuts.
[03:04:31.413 --> 03:04:37.455]  Because even they would admit it was real a few years ago, but now it's hurting them so bad.
[03:04:37.455 --> 03:04:47.097]  It's one thing to bust a few low-level people, but now that it's about to bring down the whole house of cards, it's got the globalists right at the very top kingpins coming out of the woodwork.
[03:04:47.777 --> 03:04:49.478]  To try to prop up their house of cards.
[03:04:49.478 --> 03:04:51.878]  So, very positive news.
[03:04:51.878 --> 03:04:53.579]  We're winning, folks, with God's help.
[03:04:53.579 --> 03:04:54.079]  We'll be right back.
[03:04:54.079 --> 03:04:57.680]  Stay with us in 60 seconds.
[03:04:57.680 --> 03:04:58.741]  You wanted to plug RainForce.
[03:04:58.741 --> 03:04:59.821]  Do you like RainForce?
[03:04:59.821 --> 03:05:00.341]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:05:00.341 --> 03:05:02.362]  So, my name is Ken Heckin-Ladley.
[03:05:02.362 --> 03:05:04.623]  How do I write all the books that I do?
[03:05:04.623 --> 03:05:10.905]  Four books with Dr. Judy Mykovitz, four books with Project Veritas Whistleblowers, and now two books with Alex Jones?
[03:05:10.905 --> 03:05:13.966]  That's because I use RainForce every day.
[03:05:14.306 --> 03:05:18.290]  What I always need is I always need some sort of boost in the morning.
[03:05:18.290 --> 03:05:22.233]  And so, you know, I try to exercise, eat well, take good vitamins.
[03:05:22.233 --> 03:05:27.818]  But the one thing that I have really found that makes a difference is brain force.
[03:05:27.818 --> 03:05:35.525]  I'll take brain force in the morning right before I go to my computer and I'm good for the next four or five hours writing a whole lot of stuff.
[03:05:35.525 --> 03:05:41.170]  So it really is true that brain force is something I use every day and it helps me with my writing.
[03:05:41.570 --> 03:05:42.353]  All right, we love you.
[03:05:42.353 --> 03:05:42.954]  We'll be right back.
[03:05:42.954 --> 03:05:48.030]  Get your BrainForce Plus, BrainForce Ultra, and TurboForce at InfowarStore.com.
[03:05:48.030 --> 03:05:49.093]  We'll be right back with hour number two.
[03:06:14.394 --> 03:06:15.955]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:15.955 --> 03:06:19.597]  I'm Kate Dally from katedallyradio.com and the Kate Dally Show.
[03:06:19.597 --> 03:06:21.638]  So good to be with you today.
[03:06:21.638 --> 03:06:23.198]  I have a special guest for you.
[03:06:23.198 --> 03:06:29.322]  Scott Shara is with me and his story is one that you need to hear about.
[03:06:29.322 --> 03:06:32.483]  His story has been felt by millions of people across the country.
[03:06:32.483 --> 03:06:41.868]  So many, including myself, were impacted by having a loved one in the hospital for the deadly protocol that all the hospitals consented to use across America.
[03:06:42.580 --> 03:06:47.544]  He tragically lost his sweet daughter, Grace, at the hands of the hospital protocol.
[03:06:47.544 --> 03:06:51.907]  And I think it's really important that we bring to light the legal battle that's going on.
[03:06:51.907 --> 03:06:54.149]  Many families are facing legal battles right now.
[03:06:54.149 --> 03:07:12.303]  This case has millions of people interested in its outcome and really praying for the Shara family that the hospital finally has to address what they did to his sweet daughter, Grace.
[03:07:12.816 --> 03:07:18.281]  Scott's with me, and I am so glad to have you on, Scott.
[03:07:18.281 --> 03:07:19.703]  So happy to have you here with me.
[03:07:19.703 --> 03:07:24.087]  I really appreciate you joining me.
[03:07:24.087 --> 03:07:24.808]  Scott, are you with me?
[03:07:24.808 --> 03:07:26.830]  Yeah, I'm with you.
[03:07:26.830 --> 03:07:28.511]  Thanks for having me, Kate.
[03:07:28.511 --> 03:07:29.572]  Very nice introduction.
[03:07:29.572 --> 03:07:30.193]  I appreciate it.
[03:07:31.351 --> 03:07:32.371]  You bet.
[03:07:32.371 --> 03:07:35.512]  Can you start with your story about what happened?
[03:07:35.512 --> 03:07:40.734]  Because you have something very landmark going on tomorrow that I want people to be very aware of.
[03:07:40.734 --> 03:07:47.857]  And we need to follow these cases out and not forget about the trauma that we suffered as a nation by the hands of the hospitals.
[03:07:47.857 --> 03:07:48.557]  Tell us your story.
[03:07:50.586 --> 03:07:55.791]  So, our story starts all the way back to September 22nd of 2002.
[03:07:55.791 --> 03:07:59.434]  That's when God blessed us with the little stinker named Grace.
[03:07:59.434 --> 03:08:01.295]  And she blessed our life.
[03:08:01.295 --> 03:08:03.417]  We had her for 19 years.
[03:08:03.417 --> 03:08:06.680]  And who gets to have an angel in their life for 19 years?
[03:08:06.680 --> 03:08:08.802]  I don't understand why God picked us.
[03:08:08.802 --> 03:08:09.963]  We certainly didn't deserve it.
[03:08:10.683 --> 03:08:13.845]  Well, we had an angel named Grace and Grace had Down syndrome.
[03:08:13.845 --> 03:08:15.466]  She was super high functioning.
[03:08:15.466 --> 03:08:21.670]  By the way, Kate, I have a shirt somewhat in honor of Grace and that it was part of the agenda.
[03:08:21.670 --> 03:08:29.095]  So I normally wear a collared shirt, but today I have unvaccinated life sweater.
[03:08:29.095 --> 03:08:37.881]  I wore that because that was in the first doctor's report, the first day that Grace was in the hospital, which was October 6th of 2021.
[03:08:40.422 --> 03:08:44.763]  We took her to the hospital because she had low oxygen saturation.
[03:08:44.763 --> 03:08:47.164]  Seven days later, she was dead.
[03:08:47.164 --> 03:08:53.086]  And in the first day's doctor report, this is written by what they call the COVID expert.
[03:08:53.086 --> 03:08:54.226]  The guy was so aloof.
[03:08:54.226 --> 03:08:56.347]  I've never met a doctor more rude.
[03:08:56.347 --> 03:09:08.130]  But the reason I'm wearing this shirt today is because he wrote as his last comment in his first day report, unfortunately, I think the patient probably would not be here if she has been fully vaccinated.
[03:09:09.247 --> 03:09:20.295]  So that bias was obvious, but the other bias that was even more consistent than the unvaccinated status of Grace was the fact that she had Down syndrome.
[03:09:20.295 --> 03:09:29.122]  In the 22 doctors reports that were written in the seven days Grace was in the hospital, they referenced that she had Down syndrome 36 different times.
[03:09:29.122 --> 03:09:31.264]  That's not relevant to the standard of care.
[03:09:32.024 --> 03:09:41.089]  And as you progress with Grace's stay, I'll give you the short version for the audience who hasn't heard of Grace's tragic death.
[03:09:41.089 --> 03:09:44.671]  Her last day on this earth was October 13th.
[03:09:44.671 --> 03:09:52.396]  Four days earlier on October 9th, four and a half days earlier on October 9th, they started Grace on a sedation med called Presidex.
[03:09:52.396 --> 03:09:56.498]  Of course, we find this all out because now we've gone through the records with a fine-tooth comb.
[03:09:57.429 --> 03:10:00.590]  That sedation drug should have never been started.
[03:10:00.590 --> 03:10:06.712]  It was done to set up a ventilator which was never necessary and we rejected every time.
[03:10:06.712 --> 03:10:09.273]  Grace was never on a ventilator.
[03:10:09.273 --> 03:10:13.755]  They set up her death with that sedation med.
[03:10:13.755 --> 03:10:17.076]  That med is not supposed to be used for more than 24 hours.
[03:10:17.076 --> 03:10:21.358]  It ended up being used and then put on a maximum allowable dose
[03:10:23.323 --> 03:10:23.724]  Well, we
[03:10:38.302 --> 03:10:45.487]  The purpose of the call was to ask us for a pre-authorization for the fifth time to put Grace on a ventilator just in case.
[03:10:45.487 --> 03:10:56.135]  Well, as I found out by looking at the money trail, just in case meant because they wanted a $300,000 payday, which is what they receive if you put somebody on a ventilator.
[03:10:56.135 --> 03:10:58.356]  So we said no for the fifth time.
[03:10:58.356 --> 03:11:06.442]  Then he went on immediately and said, well, Grace had such a good day yesterday, this is in spite of being sedated, that we should work on nutrition.
[03:11:06.563 --> 03:11:07.447]  Let's get her out of bed.
[03:11:07.447 --> 03:11:09.116]  Let's get her out of here in the next several days.
[03:11:09.116 --> 03:11:10.564]  So we agreed to a feeding tube.
[03:11:11.906 --> 03:11:15.028]  That phone call started at 10-12 in the morning.
[03:11:15.028 --> 03:11:21.714]  At 10-48, while we were on the phone call, he increased the Procidex to the maximum allowable dose.
[03:11:21.714 --> 03:11:23.935]  We ended the call at 10-55.
[03:11:23.935 --> 03:11:27.958]  At 10-56, he put an illegal do not resuscitate order on Grace.
[03:11:27.958 --> 03:11:37.866]  Then combined Procidex with lorazepam and morphine, which those meds in combination is what they use in a person's last hour of life in hospice care.
[03:11:38.226 --> 03:11:41.167]  So they used to euthanize Grace with those meds.
[03:11:41.167 --> 03:11:51.611]  And when it came time to revive Grace, when we screamed for the doctors and nurses to save her on a FaceTime call, they screamed back, she's DNR, do not resuscitate.
[03:11:51.611 --> 03:11:52.411]  We had no idea.
[03:11:53.383 --> 03:11:58.848]  And so we, of course, we scream back, she's not DNR, but they refuse, they refuse to enter the room.
[03:11:58.848 --> 03:12:03.433]  And we watched Grace die at 727 on October 13th on a FaceTime call.
[03:12:03.433 --> 03:12:18.247]  You know, of course, all of that has led to the lawsuit, which we filed on April 11th, this Friday, the 14th at 10am is our first hearing on the lawsuit, which, you know, you can ask some questions, we can discuss that as much as you want, Kate.
[03:12:19.750 --> 03:12:21.712]  I just feel for your family.
[03:12:21.712 --> 03:12:23.053]  So many families went through this.
[03:12:23.053 --> 03:12:34.124]  I was receiving hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of letters of people that their loved one was in the hospital, they were trying to get him out, they couldn't even get into the hospital.
[03:12:34.124 --> 03:12:38.128]  I was in a state where you could actually still get into the ICU, but
[03:12:38.686 --> 03:12:43.152]  There were so many people out there suffering from the same exact thing.
[03:12:43.152 --> 03:12:45.715]  And these hospitals got this protocol.
[03:12:45.715 --> 03:12:49.720]  And this protocol dictated what was going to happen to them.
[03:12:49.720 --> 03:12:51.963]  And everything was under the guise of COVID.
[03:12:51.963 --> 03:12:53.465]  Everything was named COVID.
[03:12:53.465 --> 03:12:55.788]  And that's really convenient when it has 98 symptoms.
[03:12:57.037 --> 03:13:09.481]  And the reason that I also wanted you on today is this story is heartbreaking because you lost a very special, special girl, a special daughter and to this madness.
[03:13:09.481 --> 03:13:13.862]  And what have we done to stop this from happening again?
[03:13:13.862 --> 03:13:25.546]  These hospitals, if they don't understand what they've done, if they cannot admit what they've done, then the next time something happens and we will get something, we will get something.
[03:13:26.683 --> 03:13:45.448]  And that protocol will also be spit out at the doctors and if the doctors go along and the nurses go along and they don't question and they don't say anything and everybody stays mum on the subject and they administer these deadly cocktails and these deadly ventilators again, we'll be right back in the same situation.
[03:13:45.948 --> 03:13:50.789]  And that's why I thought it was so important to have you on today, because it's like election fraud.
[03:13:50.789 --> 03:13:55.350]  We're not doing anything about that either, and everybody expects there to be some sort of change.
[03:13:55.350 --> 03:14:08.073]  There isn't going to be a change unless lawsuits like this, like Scott's, come out and make the hospitals understand what just happened and what they did to these poor victims.
[03:14:11.069 --> 03:14:16.050]  You really said a mouthful there, and I want to talk about two things with what you just said.
[03:14:16.050 --> 03:14:23.172]  First of all, we're looking at this, after all the research I've done, I see this has nothing to do with COVID.
[03:14:23.172 --> 03:14:27.913]  This euthanasia agenda has been going on for decades, and I can prove it.
[03:14:27.913 --> 03:14:30.773]  Beyond a shadow of a doubt, I can prove it with the documents.
[03:14:30.773 --> 03:14:38.995]  But then, as it applies to this specific lawsuit, we took the extraordinary step of not just filing against the Ascension Hospital System,
[03:14:39.575 --> 03:14:44.982]  But we also filed against five doctors and two nurses who were directly involved with Grace's death.
[03:14:44.982 --> 03:14:56.117]  And we did that because no person, no doctor, no nurse can use the excuse of following orders, following protocols, following the NIH,
[03:14:56.637 --> 03:15:02.119]  Following the hospital mandate, whatever excuse they want to use, they can't do that.
[03:15:02.119 --> 03:15:04.700]  They still are responsible for their choices.
[03:15:04.700 --> 03:15:15.463]  I have talked with a number of doctors and nurses who are still in practice, and the consistent excuse is that if we didn't do this, we would lose our jobs.
[03:15:15.463 --> 03:15:18.904]  And that excuse can never be used
[03:15:19.544 --> 03:15:40.994]  Again, and so we want this lawsuit to be on a national basis to show every doctor and nurse that you are going to be held to account and if for some reason our lawsuit gets dismissed, I still want every doctor and nurse to know you're going to be held to account in the next lifetime if you can't be held to account in this lifetime.
[03:15:42.162 --> 03:15:43.044]  I'm good.
[03:15:43.044 --> 03:15:44.306]  I still agree with you, Scott.
[03:15:44.306 --> 03:15:45.448]  We're going to come right back.
[03:15:45.448 --> 03:15:46.770]  There's so much to share on this.
[03:15:46.770 --> 03:15:49.515]  People need to know how to safeguard their loved ones, too.
[03:15:49.515 --> 03:15:52.039]  We'll be right back more with Scott Shara on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:15:56.715 --> 03:16:03.941]  In the early 1900s, certain companies were off-gassing highly toxic fluoride gases into the atmosphere.
[03:16:03.941 --> 03:16:06.763]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[03:16:06.763 --> 03:16:15.110]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers to convert these gases into fluorosilicic acid.
[03:16:15.110 --> 03:16:17.551]  Still highly toxic, but containable.
[03:16:17.551 --> 03:16:20.554]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison.
[03:16:20.854 --> 03:16:23.416]  And there was no affordable way to dispose of it.
[03:16:23.416 --> 03:16:31.841]  Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders was also the Secretary of the Treasury, who was responsible for the Public Health Service at the time.
[03:16:31.841 --> 03:16:33.682]  And by 1950, the U.S.
[03:16:33.682 --> 03:16:40.786]  government began buying this toxic, untreated, industrial waste product and dumping it into our drinking water.
[03:16:40.786 --> 03:16:45.969]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease.
[03:16:45.969 --> 03:16:49.391]  With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water.
[03:16:50.812 --> 03:17:12.121]  Infowars is a one-of-a-kind operation and so please go to Infowars store and just make a donation and you can make it one time or recurring you have a little profile there canceling time every 15 days every month every three months every six months up to nine months
[03:17:13.095 --> 03:17:16.939]  You can go in and every month or every week, whenever you want, you program it.
[03:17:16.939 --> 03:17:19.882]  You just click it, and then you decide when you want to make a donation.
[03:17:19.882 --> 03:17:20.963]  So please do that as well.
[03:17:20.963 --> 03:17:26.228]  That way we get 95% of it after credit card fees, instead of making 20, 30, 40% like we do on the products.
[03:17:26.228 --> 03:17:27.809]  But these really are amazing products.
[03:17:27.809 --> 03:17:29.891]  The big July 4th sale is going on right now.
[03:17:29.891 --> 03:17:32.513]  This is such a critical platform in the fight against the New World Order.
[03:17:32.513 --> 03:17:34.515]  The enemies out in the open were vindicated.
[03:17:34.515 --> 03:17:35.917]  People are listening more than ever.
[03:17:35.917 --> 03:17:38.039]  But in this major recession going into depression,
[03:17:38.579 --> 03:17:41.003]  And with supply chain breakdowns, I know it's hard.
[03:17:41.003 --> 03:17:41.924]  I know times are tough.
[03:17:41.924 --> 03:17:43.346]  So, thank you for your support.
[03:17:43.346 --> 03:17:47.191]  But whatever you do, pray for the broadcast and share the articles and the videos.
[03:17:47.191 --> 03:17:48.493]  That you can do for free.
[03:17:48.493 --> 03:17:50.656]  And that's just as important as keeping us on air.
[03:17:50.656 --> 03:17:53.900]  So, however God leads you in your heart to support us, please support us now.
[03:17:53.900 --> 03:17:55.002]  And I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
[03:17:55.562 --> 03:17:56.562]  God bless you.
[03:17:56.562 --> 03:18:04.784]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, is a historic book that documents the globalists in their own words, planned for our future.
[03:18:04.784 --> 03:18:06.225]  That is the hellish future.
[03:18:06.225 --> 03:18:15.647]  Now you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them, be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World at bookstores, Amazon, or Infowarshore.com.
[03:18:15.647 --> 03:18:21.228]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies we got run out.
[03:18:21.228 --> 03:18:23.209]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[03:18:23.809 --> 03:18:29.172]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and The War for the World, a signed copy, at InfoWarsHorror.com.
[03:18:29.172 --> 03:18:33.134]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[03:18:33.134 --> 03:18:38.997]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book, you'll also know that you help keep InfoWars on the air.
[03:18:38.997 --> 03:18:41.098]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book.
[03:18:41.878 --> 03:18:46.960]  How many times have you ever spoken to your son about his overseas business dealings?
[03:19:01.127 --> 03:19:03.708]  I've never spoken to my son about his overseas commitments.
[03:19:03.708 --> 03:19:05.209]  So let me get this straight.
[03:19:05.209 --> 03:19:24.658]  The FBI was withholding from congressional oversight a document showing that during the Obama administration, Biden accepted a $10 million bribe through his son, Hunter, to force the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor that was investigating corruption, an event that Donald Trump looked into, sparking the first impeachment, enforcing the arming of Ukraine, in turn setting the stage for the current war against Russia,
[03:19:24.958 --> 03:19:51.261]  Evidence of the bribe was also in Hunter Biden's laptop, which the FBI also had, but that they swore was Russian disinformation and infiltrated social media to censor during the 2020 campaign, all while the FBI investigates Trump for having classified documents, despite the FBI admittedly letting Hillary Clinton off for a similar charge in 2016, when they were simultaneously launching the Russiagate investigation into Donald Trump using falsified evidence provided by the Clinton campaign.
[03:19:51.261 --> 03:19:52.482]  Do I have that all straight?
[03:19:57.836 --> 03:20:02.470]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[03:20:02.470 --> 03:20:03.754]  It's Alex Jones!
[03:20:20.800 --> 03:20:22.721]  I'm Kate Nellie, your guest host.
[03:20:22.721 --> 03:20:24.222]  My guest is Scott Shara.
[03:20:24.222 --> 03:20:28.884]  He lost his daughter to the hospital protocol.
[03:20:28.884 --> 03:20:34.326]  I would have to say it murdered his daughter and his daughter's sweet daughter, Grace.
[03:20:34.326 --> 03:20:40.469]  In fact, their website to find out more information on this is OurAmazingGrace.net.
[03:20:40.469 --> 03:20:41.689]  OurAmazingGrace.net.
[03:20:41.689 --> 03:20:42.129]  Scott,
[03:20:46.727 --> 03:20:55.535]  I think people really need to understand this case because you were not permitted to even be in the hospital with your daughter.
[03:20:55.535 --> 03:21:02.341]  And I can't imagine hospital staff that would somehow, someway be okay with that.
[03:21:02.341 --> 03:21:11.450]  But I know from even my personal story, the hospital didn't want me in there either and tried their very best to make sure that I wasn't there.
[03:21:12.533 --> 03:21:13.534]  But I was.
[03:21:13.534 --> 03:21:16.676]  And you weren't permitted to be in the hospital.
[03:21:16.676 --> 03:21:18.137]  I can't even imagine.
[03:21:18.137 --> 03:21:20.378]  Is this part of this suit too?
[03:21:20.378 --> 03:21:28.123]  Because I can't imagine that they were allowed to keep you away as her parents.
[03:21:28.123 --> 03:21:30.424]  It's probably the most important piece of the suit.
[03:21:30.424 --> 03:21:31.905]  So what the hearing about
[03:21:32.728 --> 03:21:39.752]  is about on Friday is one of the defendant's attorneys wrote a motion to partially dismiss.
[03:21:39.752 --> 03:21:42.993]  And what that motion is about is two things.
[03:21:42.993 --> 03:21:48.256]  Number one is to wrap the most important piece of the case, which is the lack of informed consent.
[03:21:48.256 --> 03:21:55.280]  And that's where the issue of me being removed from the hospital fits with that battery claim, the lack of informed consent claim.
[03:21:55.880 --> 03:22:07.169]  They want to wrap that into a medical malpractice claim because there's state statutory limits when it's a medical malpractice claim, which is very frustrating.
[03:22:07.169 --> 03:22:09.210]  We can talk about that second.
[03:22:09.210 --> 03:22:16.256]  And then the other thing they're trying to do with the motion to partially dismiss on Friday is dismiss our declaratory judgment.
[03:22:17.066 --> 03:22:23.293]  Request for the illegal do not resuscitate order, which, you know, this is, it's critical.
[03:22:23.293 --> 03:22:33.143]  I mean, in Wisconsin, what, and I would say this is more than just Wisconsin, because I've heard of hundreds of illegal DNRs across the country.
[03:22:33.143 --> 03:22:38.169]  But in Wisconsin, the Department of Safety and Professional Services, which is the regulatory agency
[03:22:38.989 --> 03:22:53.741]  That regulates the licenses of doctors and nurses has gone on record and said that the state DNR statute does not apply to hospitals, or excuse me, to doctors in a hospital non-emergency room setting.
[03:22:53.741 --> 03:22:55.562]  So wrap your head around that.
[03:22:55.562 --> 03:23:01.587]  That means that a doctor could put an illegal DNR on anybody he wants without their permission.
[03:23:01.587 --> 03:23:02.468]  So we can't
[03:23:02.708 --> 03:23:17.858]  You know, this motion to partially dismiss is so critical that we went on Friday because the informed consent, the lack of informed consent applies to across the board with all the COVID cases and way before COVID.
[03:23:17.858 --> 03:23:20.260]  But everybody had lack of informed consent.
[03:23:20.260 --> 03:23:24.483]  The doctors just went in and did everything that they wanted to.
[03:23:24.483 --> 03:23:29.366]  If you weren't there in your situation, your husband wouldn't be alive.
[03:23:29.366 --> 03:23:32.568]  So in Grace's situation, if I would have had informed consent,
[03:23:33.289 --> 03:23:38.233]  Grace would be alive today, in spite of what they did, because I would have been able to stop it.
[03:23:38.233 --> 03:23:42.056]  I would not have approved, obviously, the things that were happening.
[03:23:42.056 --> 03:23:52.845]  So the informed consent piece is where the specific idea of they remove me, it fits under that specific claim.
[03:23:52.845 --> 03:23:56.608]  I'm so glad, I mean, that you can spell that out.
[03:23:56.608 --> 03:23:58.250]  And I really do hope that that
[03:23:59.181 --> 03:24:03.385]  Can't be taken from you guys because that is the biggest piece.
[03:24:03.385 --> 03:24:07.569]  I mean, we need to be there for our loved ones and to say something is so dire.
[03:24:07.569 --> 03:24:15.057]  What I always found was interesting was they wanted to keep me out for, you know, I could give somebody COVID.
[03:24:15.057 --> 03:24:19.882]  Well, the person that you just brought in, if that's the case and they are sick, how would you make them more sick?
[03:24:19.882 --> 03:24:20.883]  You know, it's ridiculous.
[03:24:21.323 --> 03:24:25.566]  I don't think we realize what we're doing when we're signing off when we bring somebody to the hospital.
[03:24:42.901 --> 03:24:44.202]  Boy, is that a great point.
[03:24:44.202 --> 03:24:54.906]  There's so many points where they have, like, the way I like to explain is the liberals have control of the ground game, and the ground game are those type of situations.
[03:24:54.906 --> 03:25:00.648]  So, you walk into a hospital, they want you to sign this stupid little pad with the fake pen.
[03:25:00.648 --> 03:25:09.632]  That is one of the many recommendations I have for people now, now that I'm woken up to this, is never sign anything without completely reading it.
[03:25:10.172 --> 03:25:23.137]  And in the case of entering the hospital, what you want to do specifically is ask for the printout, read it, cross off anything where you are giving rights away, initial it, and get a copy.
[03:25:23.137 --> 03:25:23.758]  It's critical.
[03:25:23.758 --> 03:25:27.019]  They're not claiming that at this point in our case.
[03:25:27.019 --> 03:25:31.341]  It'll be interesting to see how that specific situation shakes out.
[03:25:31.921 --> 03:25:37.287]  Regardless of what rights you sign away, they don't have the authority to kill you.
[03:25:37.287 --> 03:25:45.295]  What's interesting about, you know, when I look at the legal wrangling with these type of situations, it's very frustrating.
[03:25:45.295 --> 03:25:46.996]  So we filed our case on April 11th.
[03:25:47.837 --> 03:25:54.140]  On May 15th, Ascension Hospital System, the five doctors, two nurses, all had to legally respond.
[03:25:54.140 --> 03:25:54.881]  They all did.
[03:25:54.881 --> 03:26:00.804]  A few points out of Ascension Hospital System's response are interesting.
[03:26:00.804 --> 03:26:02.224]  So, I'm going to just quote these.
[03:26:02.224 --> 03:26:05.006]  So, when we file, it's called a summons and complaint.
[03:26:05.006 --> 03:26:07.387]  When they respond, it's called an answer.
[03:26:07.387 --> 03:26:14.651]  So, they wrote, quote, in answer to paragraph six of the complaint, deny that Ascension Hospital System directly provides healthcare services.
[03:26:15.211 --> 03:26:17.493]  So, you know, think through what they're saying.
[03:26:17.493 --> 03:26:19.395]  So, they use the word directly.
[03:26:19.395 --> 03:26:23.758]  So, they cannot be held liable because they don't directly provide health care services.
[03:26:23.758 --> 03:26:27.322]  Well, that's obviously ridiculous.
[03:26:27.322 --> 03:26:29.223]  This is a real interesting one to me.
[03:26:29.223 --> 03:26:34.207]  In answer to paragraph 40 of the complaint, deny that Scott Sherrill was removed from the hospital.
[03:26:34.207 --> 03:26:35.689]  Well, what was I doing then?
[03:26:36.349 --> 03:26:40.691]  You know, the stuff you can't make it up.
[03:26:40.691 --> 03:26:46.652]  Then they also have an opportunity to do what's called affirmative defenses.
[03:26:46.652 --> 03:26:49.193]  So they wrote Affirmative Defense 6.
[03:26:49.193 --> 03:26:57.736]  Any and all injuries or damages sustained by plaintiffs may be a direct and proximate result of the negligence and or decisions made by the plaintiffs.
[03:26:57.736 --> 03:26:59.177]  So where are they going with that one?
[03:26:59.177 --> 03:27:03.218]  I presume they're going to say, well, because Grace wasn't vaccinated, that's
[03:27:03.858 --> 03:27:07.200]  That's why I wore the shirt.
[03:27:07.200 --> 03:27:10.882]  So then you ask, did they agree to anything?
[03:27:10.882 --> 03:27:14.624]  So the shocker, you're sitting down thankfully, Kate.
[03:27:14.624 --> 03:27:17.626]  So they did agree to two things.
[03:27:17.626 --> 03:27:20.188]  In the someone's in complaint, they agreed to two things.
[03:27:20.188 --> 03:27:27.712]  One is that Grace was admitted to the hospital and quote, in answer to paragraph 74 of the complaint, admit that Grace Sherra passed away.
[03:27:28.524 --> 03:27:30.826]  I mean, this stuff is, it's so crazy.
[03:27:30.826 --> 03:27:36.971]  And there's another piece I would like to share if I have time right now relative to the motion to dismiss.
[03:27:36.971 --> 03:27:37.732]  Is that okay, Kate?
[03:27:38.982 --> 03:27:39.862]  Sure, you got about a minute.
[03:27:39.862 --> 03:27:40.483]  Go for it.
[03:27:40.483 --> 03:27:41.543]  Yes, please.
[03:27:41.543 --> 03:28:05.673]  So in the motion to dismiss, the attorney wrote, the legislature's purpose in enacting a statutory scheme to govern claims for damages arising out of the alleged medical negligence was to encourage health care providers to remain in Wisconsin by imposing certain limits on the causes of action that a patient or her family member can pursue and the types and amount of damages that can be recovered.
[03:28:06.351 --> 03:28:11.215]  So that's where they're trying to take the informed consent and wrap it into medical malpractice.
[03:28:11.215 --> 03:28:11.595]  Why?
[03:28:11.595 --> 03:28:16.619]  Because there's statutory limits for claims for doctors in medical malpractice.
[03:28:16.619 --> 03:28:18.081]  This is across the country.
[03:28:18.081 --> 03:28:22.845]  Why do doctors need to have limitations on medical malpractice?
[03:28:22.845 --> 03:28:25.987]  You know, they're not bashful about why.
[03:28:25.987 --> 03:28:29.010]  They're saying because otherwise the doctors won't practice in the state.
[03:28:29.010 --> 03:28:30.491]  Why don't you just be a good doctor?
[03:28:31.425 --> 03:28:34.789]  Then you don't need to have liability limitations.
[03:28:34.789 --> 03:28:35.650]  I own a business.
[03:28:35.650 --> 03:28:37.852]  I don't get liability limitations.
[03:28:37.852 --> 03:28:40.234]  If I do something wrong, I've got to make it right.
[03:28:40.234 --> 03:28:44.199]  So why do doctors get free pass?
[03:28:44.199 --> 03:28:44.979]  They don't.
[03:28:44.979 --> 03:28:45.960]  And they shouldn't.
[03:28:45.960 --> 03:28:48.023]  And we're going to try to make that stop.
[03:28:48.023 --> 03:28:50.005]  Be right back on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:28:50.005 --> 03:28:52.187]  More with Scott Sherriff when I return.
[03:28:52.187 --> 03:28:53.068]  You'll want to hear this.
[03:28:56.604 --> 03:29:01.326]  Infowarsstore.com is like a grocery store, or like a vitamin shop.
[03:29:01.326 --> 03:29:03.287]  We want to have all the best brands for you.
[03:29:03.287 --> 03:29:05.327]  We want to have a bunch of different choices for you.
[03:29:05.327 --> 03:29:07.808]  So I get constant questions online and in person.
[03:29:07.808 --> 03:29:08.629]  Hey, what's better?
[03:29:08.629 --> 03:29:09.469]  Knockout?
[03:29:09.469 --> 03:29:10.810]  What's better?
[03:29:10.810 --> 03:29:11.550]  Down-and-out?
[03:29:11.550 --> 03:29:12.090]  What's better?
[03:29:12.090 --> 03:29:14.351]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[03:29:14.351 --> 03:29:19.293]  And the answer is, different herbal formulas, different compounds are better for different people.
[03:29:19.973 --> 03:29:23.937]  So, one person might like this coffee, another person likes that coffee.
[03:29:23.937 --> 03:29:25.279]  That's how our bodies work.
[03:29:25.279 --> 03:29:26.580]  They're all very diverse.
[03:29:26.580 --> 03:29:36.771]  But we've been able to private label a national bestseller that's been sold for many years that people love and sold for a lower price under the name InfoWarsMD Good Night's Sleep.

[03:30:05.425 --> 03:30:09.670]  We haven't offered these for 50% off since last Christmas.
[03:30:09.670 --> 03:30:13.694]  These are amazing products, and for those of you on the fence, I want you to try them.
[03:30:13.694 --> 03:30:16.657]  Brain Force Ultra hits in 15 minutes, only lasts 3 hours.
[03:30:17.338 --> 03:30:17.698]  We're good
[03:30:39.124 --> 03:30:39.805]  We're good to go.
[03:30:56.861 --> 03:31:03.787]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil, which is at the foundation of our entire food supply.
[03:31:03.787 --> 03:31:12.774]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element, which has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population.
[03:31:12.774 --> 03:31:14.976]  And there are two things we need to do about it.
[03:31:15.616 --> 03:31:18.918]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[03:31:18.918 --> 03:31:27.422]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics that will naturally keep the soil rich with iodine.
[03:31:27.422 --> 03:31:37.867]  And we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day, derived from ancient sea salts found thousands of feet below the Earth's surface.
[03:31:37.867 --> 03:31:43.190]  Our InfoWars Life Survival Shield X3 is hands down the best.
[03:31:43.750 --> 03:31:45.811]  Pure nascent iodine.
[03:31:45.811 --> 03:31:49.814]  Stabilized in an activated triiodine form.

[03:31:56.518 --> 03:31:57.859]  The globalists are only humans.
[03:31:58.717 --> 03:32:00.358]  Yeah, they have control of the central banks.
[03:32:00.358 --> 03:32:01.339]  They have a lot of power.
[03:32:01.339 --> 03:32:02.699]  But they can be defeated.
[03:32:02.699 --> 03:32:05.921]  But some of their operations are going to take decades to stop.
[03:32:05.921 --> 03:32:14.127]  But one thing you can do right now is take control of your body and your family's body by purifying the water that you drink and that you cook with.
[03:32:14.127 --> 03:32:17.729]  And you do it with the highest quality gravity fed filter out there.
[03:32:17.729 --> 03:32:18.569]  This thing does 10,000 gallons.
[03:32:19.930 --> 03:32:22.631]  You can sit there and put hundreds of gallons through in a day.
[03:32:22.631 --> 03:32:27.212]  It purifies very quickly and it cuts out thousands of chemicals to non-detectable levels.
[03:32:27.212 --> 03:32:29.213]  This is what I use, which my family uses.
[03:32:29.213 --> 03:32:31.374]  It's the very best system out there for the lowest price.
[03:32:31.374 --> 03:32:34.155]  For a limited time, 10% off on top of that.
[03:32:34.155 --> 03:32:39.256]  Exclusively at InfowarStore.com on the Alexa Pure Water Filtration System.

[03:32:44.938 --> 03:32:45.759]  Don't procrastinate.
[03:32:45.759 --> 03:32:52.765]  This is one of the main areas we can take control of our lives and stop the globalists from hitting us with poison that they allow in the water supply.
[03:32:52.765 --> 03:32:57.990]  In some cases, they add the water supply like fluoride.
[03:32:57.990 --> 03:33:03.875]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:18.396 --> 03:33:30.645]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:30.645 --> 03:33:36.230]  I'm here with Scott Shara and let me tell you his story.
[03:33:36.230 --> 03:33:37.371]  His story breaks my heart.
[03:33:38.047 --> 03:33:40.328]  Because he lost grace in this.
[03:33:40.328 --> 03:33:57.892]  But I love his fight because his fight means that we could maybe change and impact this horrific system of the hospitals taking the NIH orders on what to do and telling the doctors exactly what they're going to do.
[03:33:57.892 --> 03:33:58.712]  And then on the other hand,
[03:33:58.712 --> 03:34:01.334]  I found you have doctors that don't ask any questions.
[03:34:01.334 --> 03:34:08.660]  I found doctors that were not curious at all, didn't care what the protocol was, didn't care to research it, could have cared less.
[03:34:08.660 --> 03:34:13.263]  They just wanted to do what the NIH told them to do through their hospital administrations.
[03:34:13.263 --> 03:34:15.305]  And that's kind of how it was divvied out.
[03:34:15.305 --> 03:34:24.032]  But FEMA came in with our tax dollars and with printed press money and decided to try to give people who lost a loved one
[03:34:25.372 --> 03:34:27.313]  $9,000 for funeral expenses.
[03:34:27.313 --> 03:34:30.013]  Do you want to comment on this, Scott?
[03:34:30.013 --> 03:34:35.174]  Yeah, that's quite an interesting fact and you're spot on.
[03:34:35.174 --> 03:34:47.537]  This is called the Hegelian dialectic, when the person who causes the problem then sets up the reaction and then also provides the solution.
[03:34:47.537 --> 03:34:50.158]  So the same person who caused it provides the solution.
[03:34:50.158 --> 03:34:52.118]  In this case, the government caused the problem,
[03:34:52.822 --> 03:34:57.547]  COVID is a complete PSYOP, and then they already have a pre-planned solution.
[03:34:57.547 --> 03:34:59.028]  The reaction, of course, is death.
[03:34:59.028 --> 03:35:06.916]  And the pre-planned solution is, hey, we're going to ride in on a white horse and give you $9,000 to help bury your loved one.
[03:35:06.916 --> 03:35:12.422]  And people unsuspectingly take the money, not realizing the government caused the problem.
[03:35:13.623 --> 03:35:19.028]  When we became aware of that after Grace's death, my wife was fantastic on it.
[03:35:19.028 --> 03:35:21.370]  She just said, Scott, we're not taking their dirty money.
[03:35:21.370 --> 03:35:22.991]  So we never took the money.
[03:35:22.991 --> 03:35:29.777]  And I'm glad we didn't because we would be giving tacit approval to what they did to Grace.
[03:35:29.777 --> 03:35:30.918]  Scott, this is why I love you.
[03:35:31.331 --> 03:35:33.372]  Seriously, you're a warrior.
[03:35:33.372 --> 03:35:37.973]  And a lot of people took that money, needed that money, and you resisted.
[03:35:37.973 --> 03:35:41.514]  And that's the reason you're able to do this today too.
[03:35:41.514 --> 03:35:48.836]  There was a FEMA, I'm not FEMA, but the PREP Act.
[03:35:48.836 --> 03:35:57.658]  The PREP Act went through in 2005, and I don't know why in the world, well I do know why, I could probably answer my own question, but under the HHS notification,
[03:35:58.368 --> 03:36:06.012]  And the prep act was modified early on during this whole, I call it blow vid because it's such a joke, blow vid narrative.
[03:36:06.451 --> 03:36:18.955]  And it was that the amended section added that the PREP Act liability protections extend to covered persons for recommended activities that are related to any covered countermeasure in regards to SARS-CoV-2.
[03:36:18.955 --> 03:36:23.837]  And they told the hospitals that they had to follow this.
[03:36:23.837 --> 03:36:26.498]  They were going to be open to liability.
[03:36:26.498 --> 03:36:28.199]  But you know, here's the deal.
[03:36:28.199 --> 03:36:30.519]  Number one, that should have never gone through.
[03:36:30.519 --> 03:36:32.060]  Who allowed that and why?
[03:36:33.041 --> 03:36:41.598]  I could probably answer that too, but number two, doctors take an oath and they take an oath to help our loved ones in times of need.
[03:36:44.107 --> 03:36:46.968]  That did not happen in Grace's situation.
[03:36:46.968 --> 03:36:58.150]  In Grace's situation in murder, they decided that money, and they decided obviously that the government dictating this down to their administration was far more important than saving a life.
[03:36:58.150 --> 03:37:11.793]  And this is when I lost a lot of respect for hospital personnel, is because I felt like they couldn't, or would not, I'd say would not, distinguish between the two and put the patient first.
[03:37:11.793 --> 03:37:12.573]  Your thoughts on that?
[03:37:14.772 --> 03:37:16.893]  Boy, do I have a lot of thoughts on that.
[03:37:16.893 --> 03:37:27.857]  The idea, a doctor wrote me about a month ago after you heard me on a podcast and said, Scott, just so you remember, we haven't taken the oath to do no harm for a long time.
[03:37:27.857 --> 03:37:30.978]  And that's part of what we've been programmed to believe.
[03:37:30.978 --> 03:37:37.621]  And so then when we get into a hospital setting, we assume it's a safe zone because the doctor's taken this oath to do no harm.
[03:37:38.181 --> 03:37:42.383]  So that lie, we need to debunk right here for anybody listening.
[03:37:42.383 --> 03:37:43.584]  And I can prove that.
[03:37:43.584 --> 03:37:49.627]  I mentioned at the beginning of the show, I can prove many, I think I can prove everything relative to Grace's murder.
[03:37:49.627 --> 03:37:51.988]  But this has been going on way before COVID.
[03:37:51.988 --> 03:37:54.930]  COVID exposed it to those of us who are
[03:37:55.711 --> 03:37:59.014]  Paying attention, but I'm going to give you a document reference.
[03:37:59.014 --> 03:38:01.317]  So everybody's familiar with Obamacare.
[03:38:01.317 --> 03:38:06.763]  Obamacare was written by the chief architect Ezekiel Emanuel, and this set the stage.
[03:38:06.763 --> 03:38:13.270]  It was set way before this, but this legally set the stage for what happened with the SIOP known as COOP.
[03:38:13.750 --> 03:38:15.171]  That's what that man believed.
[03:38:15.171 --> 03:38:16.352]  That's why he was hired to write Obamacare
[03:38:34.082 --> 03:38:40.089]  If you pull Obamacare from Google, you will see that on page 141, it's a 906 page document, page 141 is section 1553.
[03:38:40.089 --> 03:38:42.392]  Section 1553 is the legal license to kill us, and it says that
[03:38:50.226 --> 03:39:04.108]  Any government cannot discriminate and may not subject an individual or institutional health care entity to discrimination on the basis that that entity does not provide any health care item or service
[03:39:05.669 --> 03:39:15.059]  Furnished for the purpose of causing or for the purpose of assisting in causing the death of any individual such as by assisted suicide, euthanasia, or mercy killing.
[03:39:15.059 --> 03:39:23.748]  So right there we have in black and white the authority to kill people, so Grace specifically, by euthanizing her.
[03:39:23.748 --> 03:39:28.153]  If you read section 1553 of the Affordable Care Act,
[03:39:28.946 --> 03:39:29.927]  We're good to go.
[03:39:49.139 --> 03:39:57.188]  That is written by the Palliative Care Network of Wisconsin and it's a training document for doctors to kill patients with Down syndrome.
[03:39:57.188 --> 03:39:58.490]  It was written by two MDs.
[03:39:58.490 --> 03:40:06.159]  It was written in July of 2011, the year after Obamacare was passed, and it walks through all the problems that
[03:40:06.679 --> 03:40:09.960]  People with Down syndrome have to set up a transition statement.
[03:40:09.960 --> 03:40:12.161]  So they list about 50 problems.
[03:40:12.161 --> 03:40:19.624]  Cardiac septal defects, thyroid dysfunction, congenital hip dislocation, etc, etc, etc.
[03:40:19.624 --> 03:40:20.024]  Why?
[03:40:20.024 --> 03:40:23.585]  Because what the transition statement says it all.
[03:40:23.585 --> 03:40:25.546]  The lifelong toll on families is high.
[03:40:25.546 --> 03:40:26.746]  I'm quoting right out of the document.
[03:40:27.146 --> 03:40:38.853]  So, if you look at all those problems, and now you're a healthcare worker, you get the Down Syndrome person in your bed to take care of, and you see, okay, this is how I've been trained.
[03:40:38.853 --> 03:40:40.454]  These people are a problem.
[03:40:40.454 --> 03:40:43.076]  The family doesn't want them because there's so much problem.
[03:40:43.696 --> 03:40:49.643]  And so then it says part of a robust plan of care includes acknowledgement of this toll by health care workers.
[03:40:49.643 --> 03:40:53.227]  So the Down Syndrome person is a toll on the family.
[03:40:53.227 --> 03:40:56.090]  I'm telling you bluntly, Grace was not a toll on our family.
[03:40:56.090 --> 03:41:04.299]  So the Down Syndrome person, they're convincing the medical professionals that they are a toll on the family and that medical professional needs to be responsible
[03:41:04.759 --> 03:41:06.100]  To help that family out.
[03:41:06.100 --> 03:41:07.821]  So then they have the killing statement.
[03:41:07.821 --> 03:41:19.408]  It says specifically, whenever possible, decision makers for people with Down syndrome, that's the doctors, should be encouraged to use substituted judgment to make key palliative care decisions.
[03:41:19.408 --> 03:41:22.610]  All efforts should be made to determine the preferences of the patient.
[03:41:22.610 --> 03:41:30.514]  However, because of lifelong cognitive impairment, the views of the person with Down syndrome may not be known.
[03:41:30.514 --> 03:41:31.835]  And that's insane!
[03:41:31.835 --> 03:41:33.116]  But this follows that
[03:41:34.048 --> 03:41:39.271]  Collectivism that Ezekiel Emanuel was hired to put inside of Obamacare.
[03:41:39.271 --> 03:41:48.477]  So in collectivism, we can't have non-contributing members of society getting the same medical care as contributing members of society.
[03:41:48.477 --> 03:41:53.720]  So this is a literal smoking gun as to why Grace was murdered.
[03:41:53.720 --> 03:41:56.302]  And I can't tell enough people this.
[03:41:56.302 --> 03:41:58.123]  And it has nothing to do with Down syndrome.
[03:41:58.123 --> 03:42:01.805]  This has to do with elderly, anybody who is disabled.
[03:42:02.185 --> 03:42:10.170]  Remember, all of us are going to be non-contributing citizens sometime in our life.
[03:42:10.170 --> 03:42:12.832]  The paper is all about devaluing life.
[03:42:12.832 --> 03:42:15.793]  It's devaluing people's existence.
[03:42:15.793 --> 03:42:18.835]  And with a sweep of a pen.
[03:42:18.835 --> 03:42:20.717]  I cannot wrap my brain around that.
[03:42:20.717 --> 03:42:23.078]  And we do not look at that documentation.
[03:42:23.078 --> 03:42:24.839]  Obamacare is in full effect.
[03:42:56.616 --> 03:43:06.242]  With all the craziness in the world, the collapsing borders, the war with Russia, the insanity, the currency devaluations, the economy going crazy.
[03:43:06.242 --> 03:43:11.546]  You are crazy, in my view, if you don't get high-quality, storable food and water filtration and self-defense.
[03:43:11.986 --> 03:43:13.667]  Now, we're not selling guns and ammo.
[03:43:13.667 --> 03:43:16.649]  That's for you to go out and get for yourself and learn how to use if you haven't.
[03:43:16.649 --> 03:43:18.270]  And I'm preaching the choir on that.
[03:43:18.270 --> 03:43:23.213]  But a lot of people got plenty of guns, but they don't have enough storable food or water filtration.
[03:43:23.213 --> 03:43:24.934]  This is something you need now.
[03:43:24.934 --> 03:43:29.497]  And we've got it in the food department and in the high quality water filtration department.
[03:43:29.497 --> 03:43:35.220]  The highest quality food, the best water filtration at the lowest prices you're going to find and still get quality.
[03:43:35.220 --> 03:43:41.384]  Infowarsstore.com is running a special right now for 10% off on all storable food and on water.
[03:43:41.764 --> 03:43:43.126]  And air filtration.
[03:43:43.126 --> 03:43:45.810]  Ladies and gentlemen, you cannot beat this deal.
[03:43:45.810 --> 03:43:47.111]  Our prices are already the lowest.
[03:43:47.111 --> 03:43:49.975]  At 10% off, it's an insane deal for a limited time.
[03:43:49.975 --> 03:43:53.901]  Go to nfowarstore.com and get prepared while you still can.
[03:43:56.533 --> 03:44:02.136]  I want to thank all of you over the years who have supported InfoWars financially and with word of mouth and prayer.
[03:44:02.136 --> 03:44:09.740]  All the success that we've had together against the Globalists and the fact that we're not caught flat-footed during their major takeover is because of you.
[03:44:09.740 --> 03:44:11.962]  Humanity has a real fighting chance.
[03:44:12.722 --> 03:44:19.765]  I just want to thank you all for buying products at InfoWarsTore.com, like books, and films, and supplements, and water filtration, air filtration, and so much more.
[03:44:19.765 --> 03:44:32.910]  But for those of you that want to actually give us a straight donation so we get almost 100% of the money to fund our operation during this critical time, go to InfoWarsTore.com and right at the top you'll see a link to make a straight donation.
[03:44:32.910 --> 03:44:35.732]  A one-time donation of $5, $10, $50, or a recurring donation you can cancel any time.
[03:44:39.033 --> 03:44:40.494]  I want to thank all you that have donated.
[03:44:40.494 --> 03:44:53.983]  I want to encourage those of you out there that want to support Freedom to take action now and be part of the global awakening, the new renaissance that's countered the Great Reset by going to InfoWarsTore.com and clicking on the donate button and giving today.
[03:44:53.983 --> 03:44:55.324]  Thank you so much for your support.
[03:44:55.324 --> 03:44:56.005]  Please take action.
[03:44:56.621 --> 03:45:02.986]  The globalists aren't just targeting us through the poison shots or the electromagnetic 5G or the GMO crops.
[03:45:02.986 --> 03:45:09.431]  They're hitting us with hundreds of chemicals that the EPA has authorized companies and industry to use.
[03:45:09.431 --> 03:45:12.773]  One of the top pesticides used is Atrazine.
[03:45:12.773 --> 03:45:21.940]  The allowable level the government admits that they allow to be in your water supply is enough to sterilize you and basically turn your son into a feminized mutant.
[03:45:21.940 --> 03:45:22.401]  Look it up.
[03:45:23.021 --> 03:45:24.382]  Don't let them do this to your family.
[03:45:24.382 --> 03:45:27.604]  We have the very best gravity-fed filter system out there.
[03:45:27.604 --> 03:45:30.746]  Highest rated at half the price of leading competitors.
[03:45:30.746 --> 03:45:33.067]  The Alexa Pure, ready to ship to you right now.
[03:45:33.067 --> 03:45:35.849]  We have replacement filters for folks who have already gotten it.
[03:45:35.849 --> 03:45:37.289]  It does 10,000 gallons before you replace them.
[03:45:37.289 --> 03:45:38.290]  It is amazing.
[03:45:38.290 --> 03:45:39.911]  It's great for your home, your business.
[03:45:39.911 --> 03:45:43.133]  You can put swamp water in it, tap water, well water.
[03:45:43.133 --> 03:45:44.554]  Almost everything is contaminated.
[03:45:44.554 --> 03:45:48.316]  This is how you take control of the fluids in your body and counter the globalist onslaught.
[03:45:48.616 --> 03:46:00.582]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[03:46:00.582 --> 03:46:02.904]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[03:46:02.904 --> 03:46:06.846]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[03:46:06.846 --> 03:46:10.768]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[03:46:12.205 --> 03:46:15.768]  They really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[03:46:15.768 --> 03:46:24.576]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[03:46:24.576 --> 03:46:27.479]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[03:46:27.479 --> 03:46:33.184]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[03:46:34.005 --> 03:46:34.945]  I know you spread the word.
[03:46:34.945 --> 03:46:36.466]  I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful.
[03:46:36.466 --> 03:46:37.026]  Keep doing it.
[03:46:37.026 --> 03:46:45.970]  But most viewers and listeners never go to infowarstore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life, all at the same time keeping us on air.
[03:46:45.970 --> 03:46:50.292]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at infowarstore.com.
[03:46:50.292 --> 03:46:55.234]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to infowarstore.com, our funding problems will be over.
[03:46:55.234 --> 03:46:55.994]  Please take action now.
[03:46:57.975 --> 03:47:03.897]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[03:47:16.299 --> 03:47:23.348]  There are a couple of things, Scott, that I want to bring up.
[03:47:23.348 --> 03:47:27.172]  Number one, remdesivir was part of this protocol.
[03:47:27.172 --> 03:47:33.360]  They were trying to shove down everybody, and I know people in the hospital that where the nurses actually tried to sneak it into the IVs.
[03:47:34.000 --> 03:47:50.449]  The actual name of it is Vekluri and I think they did that on purpose because the actual name is Vekluri knowing that remdesivir would be found out after many many deaths then they could go to Vekluri which by the way is now in all of our hospitals all the way down to newborns.
[03:47:50.449 --> 03:47:53.090]  It's that dangerous drug that didn't even pass the Ebola.
[03:47:53.590 --> 03:47:54.491]  It's a great question.
[03:48:22.026 --> 03:48:25.767]  Because that is that real name that they're going by now and using it.
[03:48:25.767 --> 03:48:26.587]  And that's scary.
[03:48:26.587 --> 03:48:28.047]  Also, lawsuits have been filed.
[03:48:28.047 --> 03:48:28.387]  St.
[03:48:28.387 --> 03:48:38.189]  Agnes Medical Center, Community Regional Medical Center, Clovis Community Medical Center, Kaiser Permanente in Riverside, Redlands Community Hospital, all kinds of hospitals too.
[03:48:38.189 --> 03:48:41.310]  This is the way we fight this and we make some change.
[03:48:41.310 --> 03:48:50.232]  Because if we don't, if we don't have the Scott Sheras in the world, we will succumb to total control of these hospitals.
[03:48:50.772 --> 03:49:07.687]  There will be no answer when you go to the hospitals and loved ones will be removed and they will make decisions for you and they will put you in a position where they give you horrifying experimental drugs and no one's going to call them out and that's why I love Scott Shera and his family so much for doing what they're doing.
[03:49:07.687 --> 03:49:15.974]  They resisted the FEMA bribe, I'll call it a bribe, they resisted the FEMA bribes because when you signed on to that money you had to sign on to never suing anybody.
[03:49:16.635 --> 03:49:22.711]  And they resisted that and they knew that they needed to fight this and I'm so happy to hear this.
[03:49:22.711 --> 03:49:25.238]  How can people help you, Scott, in this fight?
[03:49:26.986 --> 03:49:35.728]  Well, the main thing they can do is share this message with other people, because we got into this campaign to save lives.
[03:49:35.728 --> 03:49:41.850]  We're standing on Genesis 50-20, what Satan meant for evil, God meant for good, the saving of many lives.
[03:49:41.850 --> 03:49:43.850]  So, both physically and spiritually.
[03:49:43.850 --> 03:49:50.072]  Physically, share this message, because if your belief does not change relative to hospitals,
[03:49:51.428 --> 03:49:53.389]  You are going to die in a hospital.
[03:49:53.389 --> 03:49:58.453]  Your best defense is to change your belief, so then by changing your belief you become prepared.
[03:49:58.453 --> 03:49:59.953]  So, share the message.
[03:49:59.953 --> 03:50:03.796]  Then spiritually, we see the time is very urgent.
[03:50:03.796 --> 03:50:06.458]  So, what can you do spiritually?
[03:50:06.458 --> 03:50:12.021]  We are all responsible to God to do something with our talents, whether you have one talent or a hundred.
[03:50:12.021 --> 03:50:14.122]  I'm not expecting people to file lawsuits.
[03:50:14.122 --> 03:50:14.703]  I mean, we have
[03:50:15.243 --> 03:50:25.671]  The ability to do that, so God demands us to do it at a higher level than somebody else, but do something other than sitting on the couch and waiting for other people to do it.
[03:50:25.671 --> 03:50:30.415]  If we all do what our God-given talents are, we can stop this.
[03:50:30.415 --> 03:50:39.222]  And then, if you're wanting to help us directly, we're asking people to go to GraceShara, S-C-H-A-R-A dot com, put in your name and email address,
[03:50:39.802 --> 03:50:46.067]  Because we are going to have calls to action as this case proceeds, especially if I get sued for defamation.
[03:50:46.067 --> 03:50:48.269]  I mean, you know I'm out there.
[03:50:48.269 --> 03:50:49.470]  I'm doing interviews every day.
[03:50:49.470 --> 03:50:50.590]  I've been on over 600.
[03:50:50.590 --> 03:50:54.233]  I'm calling graces death murder because that's what it is.
[03:50:54.233 --> 03:51:00.298]  And I don't care if I get sued, but if I get sued, we're going to have obviously another call to action right now.
[03:51:00.778 --> 03:51:09.405]  We're handling the lawsuit personally, but we're hoping to be able to utilize Grace's case for raising funds for other cases.
[03:51:09.405 --> 03:51:19.274]  There's 1.2 million Americans that this happened to in the 39 months of the plandemic, the scandemic, the pandemic, whatever you want to call it.
[03:51:19.734 --> 03:51:19.974]  I love that.
[03:51:19.974 --> 03:51:22.616]  And I do hope people really help out because
[03:51:40.365 --> 03:52:00.337]  You really are putting yourself out there for others right now in the name of grace which I love because what a loving girl she was and caring girl and I can't imagine this loss in your family and I feel so bad for your family and I feel bad for the families all over the country that have incurred this loss at the hands of the hospital.
[03:52:00.837 --> 03:52:10.180]  Many people were trying to get in because they knew what they were up against or they found out after some research and the hospitals wouldn't let them in to be with their loved ones.
[03:52:10.180 --> 03:52:14.581]  And these hospitals need to be made held accountable for those kinds of decisions.
[03:52:14.581 --> 03:52:20.462]  I remember when they were telling me this in the ICU, oh my gosh, you know, oh, it's just so sad.
[03:52:20.462 --> 03:52:21.503]  We had to keep people out.
[03:52:21.503 --> 03:52:22.463]  I said, no, you didn't.
[03:52:22.463 --> 03:52:23.963]  You didn't have to keep people out.
[03:52:23.963 --> 03:52:25.364]  There was nobody telling you this.
[03:52:25.364 --> 03:52:29.265]  And it takes the personnel at the hospital to resist these things.
[03:52:29.724 --> 03:52:38.301]  The only way that the HHS could do all of this is if they had willing doctors and nurses to go along with this and not question anything.
[03:52:38.301 --> 03:52:40.827]  And that needs to be exposed.
[03:52:42.734 --> 03:52:48.155]  I agree a hundred percent and the doctors and nurses I talk with, it's an embarrassment.
[03:52:48.155 --> 03:52:50.315]  I talk with a lady who's 66 years old.
[03:52:50.315 --> 03:52:55.797]  She's a nurse in a hospital in Appleton, Wisconsin and she originally said that I was lying.
[03:52:55.797 --> 03:53:01.458]  She found out that I wasn't because the hospital she was a nurse at and she's the power of attorney for her dad.
[03:53:01.458 --> 03:53:04.118]  The doctor put an illegal DNR order on her dad.
[03:53:04.118 --> 03:53:08.719]  When I talked with her, I asked her if she'd come on radio and TV with me to help save lives.
[03:53:09.039 --> 03:53:13.801]  And she said, I can't, I'm a year away from retirement, and I don't want to jeopardize my job.
[03:53:13.801 --> 03:53:28.907]  So this is, these people are accessories to the mass genocide that has happened in, I mean, it's been going on for a long time, but was exposed in this 39 month COVID period.
[03:53:30.202 --> 03:53:31.382]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:53:31.382 --> 03:53:39.206]  You know, I spoke with Reggie Littlejohn yesterday, interviewer, and we talked about the last NADA.
[03:53:39.206 --> 03:53:54.491]  And on page 992, there's the pandemic treaty that went through that basically put all these agencies like the WHO, it was like a ready-made Congress signed off on kind of deal where we would add all of these things coming.
[03:53:54.491 --> 03:53:58.253]  And the only reason they would do that is if they had more things planned for us.
[03:53:59.289 --> 03:54:04.204]  And if they do, and if they try to do this, we will be in the same predicament again.
[03:54:05.060 --> 03:54:07.041]  And we have got to stop that from happening.
[03:54:07.041 --> 03:54:12.103]  We actually have to do something to make this so that this is not going on all over the country.
[03:54:12.103 --> 03:54:18.986]  I had many tearful people calling me and messaging me and begging for help and they weren't receiving help.
[03:54:18.986 --> 03:54:20.186]  And I felt so bad.
[03:54:20.186 --> 03:54:27.649]  The frontline doctors were the only ones that were actually helping people and having them understand what they could do, like my husband, to get them out.
[03:54:27.649 --> 03:54:28.789]  And that's what saved my husband.
[03:54:28.789 --> 03:54:30.130]  So there are some good doctors.
[03:54:30.590 --> 03:54:39.893]  But for the majority, what I learned was that they aren't curious, they won't read up, they will not look at studies, they don't care because it's about the job, like you said.
[03:54:39.893 --> 03:54:47.556]  And, you know, I work with somebody that's constantly saying, Uncle Miltie, that's constantly saying, you know, people will put on the brown shirt.
[03:54:48.511 --> 03:54:51.055]  And that's what's happening in our country right now.
[03:54:51.055 --> 03:54:52.256]  And we better stop it.
[03:54:52.256 --> 03:54:56.982]  We've got to stop putting all of our careers and everything ahead of people's lives.
[03:54:56.982 --> 03:54:58.544]  This is not okay.
[03:54:58.544 --> 03:55:00.547]  Any final thoughts for you, Scott?
[03:55:00.547 --> 03:55:04.692]  Things that you want to warn people about and let people know about in your case?
[03:55:06.912 --> 03:55:12.274]  It's not just about my case, but you gave a call to action that we have to stop this.
[03:55:12.274 --> 03:55:14.655]  So how can we stop this?
[03:55:14.655 --> 03:55:17.896]  And I would say it isn't about an action.
[03:55:17.896 --> 03:55:19.616]  It's about an attitude of the heart.
[03:55:19.616 --> 03:55:21.617]  How they snagged us with this
[03:55:22.463 --> 03:55:25.424]  First go around is through fear propaganda.
[03:55:25.424 --> 03:55:29.505]  And we know that Satan loves lies, deception and fear.
[03:55:29.505 --> 03:55:31.666]  So the fear propaganda is going to happen again.
[03:55:31.666 --> 03:55:37.548]  We don't know how it's going to expose itself with this next round or whatever they have planned.
[03:55:37.548 --> 03:55:40.329]  But we know that that is going to be the tactic.
[03:55:40.329 --> 03:55:46.231]  And I would say out of all the things that I have learned, so that I'm prepared for the next round is to
[03:55:46.271 --> 03:55:46.831]  Absolutely.
[03:55:46.831 --> 03:55:49.972]  You know, a pandemic is when people fall dead all around you.
[03:55:49.972 --> 03:55:54.794]  I mean, on the street or at the store, at the post office, all those places we could go, right?
[03:56:13.129 --> 03:56:19.855]  So it's not a pandemic if the only place they die is in the ICU on an experimental drug.
[03:56:19.855 --> 03:56:30.163]  If they're on an experimental drug and a ventilator too soon and they're trying to tell you you're in a pandemic, unless you're seeing this in front of your eyeballs, we are not in a pandemic.
[03:56:30.163 --> 03:56:37.850]  But everybody refers to it as a pandemic and everybody talks about what we just went through as if it happened, but it wasn't even in front of our own faces.
[03:56:37.910 --> 03:56:38.291]  We're good to go.
[03:56:51.573 --> 03:56:55.175]  Yeah, I mean, I was not awake till after Grace died.
[03:56:55.175 --> 03:57:08.903]  I'm awake now and these are, my wife just sent me an article this morning about a local man who was prominent that died of supposedly of COVID, but it was in the mainstream media and it's how they do it.
[03:57:08.903 --> 03:57:19.509]  Now I know about the alternative media and I encourage everybody to find reliable alternative media sources like this one and share it with your friends because
[03:57:20.209 --> 03:57:23.290]  The mainstream media is all in on this.
[03:57:23.290 --> 03:57:26.731]  Everybody's in on this propaganda campaign.
[03:57:26.731 --> 03:57:28.071]  Thank you, Scott Shera.

[03:58:53.308 --> 03:58:55.229]  Didn't they know this would backfire?
[03:58:55.229 --> 03:58:56.729]  We were waiting for the mug shot.
[03:58:56.729 --> 03:58:59.549]  We learned today they wouldn't have it, so we've made our own.
[03:58:59.549 --> 03:59:01.550]  And it says political prisoner.
[03:59:02.330 --> 03:59:04.291]  With an image of President Trump.
