[00:00.000 --> 00:23.600]  We are on the March the Empire is on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[00:30.000 --> 00:38.400]  Hard to believe seems like the week just started it's Friday the 12th day of August 2016
[00:38.400 --> 00:43.600]  we're gonna have open phones throughout the four-hour transmission today and we
[00:43.600 --> 00:47.960]  are going to have of course a former campaign head for Donald Trump Roger
[00:47.960 --> 00:50.400]  Stone popping in with all the latest developments at the bottom of the hour
[00:50.400 --> 00:54.880]  then we have Pastor Manning joining us in the third hour but I do intend to take
[00:54.880 --> 01:04.200]  a lot of phone calls today or do my best to get to many as I can just a decade
[01:04.200 --> 01:14.040]  ago so-called MSM state run corporate run global run media crony capitalist
[01:14.040 --> 01:20.880]  media monopoly media establishment media whatever you want to call it they
[01:20.880 --> 01:28.280]  would deny that the Federal Reserve was a private consortium they would deny
[01:28.280 --> 01:32.720]  that there was a move for world government or carbon taxes they would
[01:32.720 --> 01:41.600]  deny that there were plans to get rid of nation-states borders they would
[01:41.600 --> 01:49.480]  deny basically everything you see them admitting they're doing today they would
[01:49.480 --> 01:54.400]  deny that the Bilderberg group even existed now the Bilderberg group puts
[01:54.400 --> 02:01.480]  out press releases and so what happened to the credibility of the people that
[02:01.480 --> 02:06.560]  were talking about those subjects it went up what happened to the credibility
[02:06.560 --> 02:10.400]  of the individuals that said it didn't exist it went down but still you have a
[02:10.400 --> 02:17.680]  unified dinosaur media hundreds of outlets on television and cable and
[02:17.680 --> 02:23.160]  thousands of newspapers that despite the fact that their power is massively
[02:23.160 --> 02:31.120]  diminished when they all combine forces together you know the wonder twins
[02:31.120 --> 02:39.960]  activate form of a pterodactyl well the globalist wonder slobs activate form of
[02:39.960 --> 02:47.760]  traitors form of hoaxers but I'm telling you they're on their last legs folks and
[02:47.760 --> 02:54.440]  and economics show that their ratings continuing to go from an ocean to like a
[02:54.440 --> 03:01.080]  drying pool in the African savannah compared to the power of the mainstream
[03:01.080 --> 03:09.560]  media 50 60 years ago it's the Atlantic Ocean compared to Lake Travis outside
[03:09.560 --> 03:14.680]  Austin Texas it's a good size lake but you pull back from the topography with
[03:14.680 --> 03:22.280]  the satellite it's tiny compared to the Atlantic Ocean and it's now watching
[03:22.280 --> 03:29.120]  them try to come up with new systems to try to revive themselves is wild and
[03:29.120 --> 03:42.720]  their latest talking point is just hide it in plain view MSNBC CNN ABC all of
[03:42.720 --> 03:48.680]  them are in the news today saying of course we're for Clinton it's like MSNBC
[03:48.680 --> 03:51.960]  at the talking point of course we're arresting tea partyers and not giving
[03:51.960 --> 03:55.960]  them 501 C3 and shutting down conservative churches you're racist you
[03:55.960 --> 04:02.080]  deserve it we've dehumanized you that's one step away from locking people up
[04:02.080 --> 04:08.600]  they like to lock us up just like there's now lawsuits involved it's been
[04:08.600 --> 04:14.200]  confirmed that there are secret meetings going on with a whole bunch of
[04:14.200 --> 04:19.320]  different states attorney generals to begin in guiding man-made climate change
[04:19.320 --> 04:27.080]  deniers we're gonna go to break come back with CNN and let's go out to break
[04:27.080 --> 04:30.640]  with them just briefly here admitting here's the first part of the club quite
[04:30.640 --> 04:35.120]  a while longer what happens to other folks who want to run against her because
[04:35.120 --> 04:38.600]  she's doing what they call politics freezing pockets because the donors are
[04:38.600 --> 04:40.880]  giving her money thinking she's gonna run that means they're not gonna have
[04:40.880 --> 04:43.640]  available money for other candidates and she doesn't and I don't think she's
[04:43.640 --> 04:47.160]  gonna give it to him she's on her way to deciding we'll see exciting we couldn't
[04:47.160 --> 04:51.800]  help her any more than we have I'm just a free ride so far from the media we're
[04:51.800 --> 04:55.320]  the biggest ones promoting our campaign so and of course Como's a total
[04:55.320 --> 04:59.520]  political operative stay with us we'll be back
[04:59.520 --> 05:03.840]  Joe Biggs here with info wars.com same media that labels Hillary health
[05:03.840 --> 05:08.840]  questions conspiracy theories demand McCain's medical history in 2008
[05:08.840 --> 05:14.400]  double standard exposed as 59% of voters demand to see Clinton's medical records
[05:14.400 --> 05:19.080]  article up by Paul Joseph Watson CNN reported on how McCain was forced to
[05:19.080 --> 05:23.360]  give select members of the media a three-hour glimpse at his medical records
[05:23.360 --> 05:27.680]  after intense speculation put him under pressure to prove to the public that he
[05:27.680 --> 05:32.200]  was physically fit for office because he would have been the oldest president
[05:32.200 --> 05:38.400]  ever McCain had already released 1500 pages of medical records back in 1999
[05:38.400 --> 05:42.800]  however despite Hillary being just two years younger than McCain was in 2008
[05:42.800 --> 05:46.520]  CNN reported that those demanding the release of Clinton's health history in
[05:46.520 --> 05:51.000]  2016 were being conspiratorial the network also bashed Matt Drudge for
[05:51.000 --> 05:55.640]  posting photos of Clinton being helped up steps during a campaign stop in South
[05:55.640 --> 06:00.920]  Carolina this has been Joe Biggs with info wars.com not a group you develop

[06:04.640 --> 06:09.080]  people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the
[06:09.080 --> 06:13.760]  most I mean I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and
[06:13.760 --> 06:18.560]  beverages in my system but right now we're dealing with massive parasites
[06:18.560 --> 06:23.080]  which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism
[06:23.080 --> 06:27.200]  right now with all the refugees spreading disease around we have
[06:27.200 --> 06:31.200]  biological warfare going on everywhere these are all parasites tell us about
[06:31.200 --> 06:34.160]  all the stuff I said there's so many things that are in it you have the neem in
[06:34.160 --> 06:38.640]  there you have the organic clove bud the organic wormwood I recommend doing a
[06:38.640 --> 06:42.400]  parasite plans at least twice a year all right well I'm glad we've got some back
[06:42.400 --> 06:45.320]  in because I'm going back on it today it just came back in yesterday living

[07:02.480 --> 07:06.560]  about our research into what has been called the iodine conspiracy I've told
[07:06.560 --> 07:10.280]  you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can
[07:10.280 --> 07:14.840]  devastate IQ and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of
[07:14.840 --> 07:18.640]  the food and adding fluoride the bad member of the halogen family into the
[07:18.640 --> 07:23.120]  water they took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in and when the
[07:23.120 --> 07:27.640]  Fukushima crisis worsened as it still is worsening today I was there telling you
[07:27.640 --> 07:33.080]  how to prepare yourself and your family now in 2016 even more information has
[07:33.080 --> 07:37.520]  been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut which many
[07:37.520 --> 07:42.080]  experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning
[07:42.080 --> 07:45.880]  iodine you can pull these studies up for yourself this is the real deal folks
[07:45.880 --> 07:49.840]  and the truth is that iodine is essential in my view to any optimum
[07:49.840 --> 07:55.200]  health regimen stock up on survival shield x2 today at info wars life.com or
[07:55.200 --> 08:00.840]  by calling 888-253-3139
[08:00.840 --> 08:09.840]  we are on the March the Empire is on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[08:09.840 --> 08:11.840]  network
[08:11.840 --> 08:22.840]  I'm waiting in my cold cell when the bell begins to chime
[08:23.840 --> 08:32.840]  reflecting on my past life and the republic and it doesn't have much time
[08:32.840 --> 08:38.040]  because of Hillary gets in office because of fire they're gonna stack the
[08:38.040 --> 08:42.040]  Supreme Court
[08:42.040 --> 08:48.040]  sands of time for what made this country great are running low
[08:52.040 --> 09:00.120]  and the decadent childish foolish people that have inherited this great
[09:00.120 --> 09:13.120]  nation laughs at their own enslavement their own destruction very very sad
[09:14.120 --> 09:24.480]  the bottom line is this patriots are not going to go along with it and in a
[09:24.480 --> 09:32.760]  republic you can have 51 percent of people vote to enslave the other 49 but
[09:32.760 --> 09:40.360]  you can't do it because it's limited under the confines of the charter of
[09:40.360 --> 09:47.040]  that republic and that's why the republic became the model of the world
[09:47.040 --> 09:51.400]  after the United States set up this particular type of republic a limited
[09:51.400 --> 09:57.560]  democracy and it created fantastic innovation and wealth that system
[09:57.560 --> 10:02.360]  competes with the globalist technocracy and is being pulled down in front of our
[10:02.360 --> 10:08.880]  very eyes and the folly of the fake intellectuals believing that they're
[10:08.880 --> 10:17.320]  part of the power structure when they are being prepared like weak at the fall
[10:17.320 --> 10:28.200]  of autumn for the grim reaper to come with his sickle and lay them low but I
[10:28.200 --> 10:37.040]  guess God is kind to the stupid because they never even know what hit him they
[10:37.040 --> 10:41.760]  never even see how they become poorer over the years and they never know why
[10:41.760 --> 10:53.640]  when I say poor I mean culturally poor empty disempowered disembodied laid low
[10:53.640 --> 10:58.360]  big broadcast today obviously I am gonna have to be a big boy and really try to
[10:58.360 --> 11:03.240]  be professional and focused here to get all of this information out there is a
[11:03.240 --> 11:10.360]  new trend that we've noticed by the White House press secretaries and by the
[11:10.360 --> 11:14.960]  State Department secretaries and others to just say we're lying to you there's
[11:14.960 --> 11:19.640]  nothing you can do and then laugh at you they're just going public with what
[11:19.640 --> 11:22.840]  they've been doing for a long time gruber saying thank God you're so stupid
[11:22.840 --> 11:27.560]  don't have a memory we're gonna rape you hard we're gonna triple your prices
[11:27.560 --> 11:33.680]  and start sniggling and sniggering and you talk about dishonorable filth they
[11:33.680 --> 11:38.480]  are it but there's an article that's the top of drugs report calm it's also up
[11:38.480 --> 11:42.800]  on infowars.com from the observer tech companies Apple Twitter Google and
[11:42.800 --> 11:48.400]  Instagram collude to defeat Trump they admit they meet at the White House and
[11:48.400 --> 11:52.880]  get talking points they admit that they fix the search results and block news and
[11:52.880 --> 11:56.760]  only promote negative news against Trump they admit they put up a hedge around
[11:56.760 --> 12:02.080]  Trump so you never hear what he actually said just they tell you what he said out
[12:02.080 --> 12:06.800]  of context it's so frustrating to actually see them get away with this
[12:06.800 --> 12:14.880]  with the low-information voter out there it really is amazing but we're gonna be
[12:14.880 --> 12:19.280]  getting into some of that today speaking of protective walls keep the public
[12:19.280 --> 12:23.480]  from actually getting the truth there's photos out we're gonna be showing the
[12:23.480 --> 12:27.680]  TV viewers side of this but the articles up on infowars.com this is the
[12:27.680 --> 12:31.400]  top of report I ought to send my reporters out to do to show Al Gore's
[12:31.400 --> 12:36.480]  houses and show Bill Clinton's houses I mean these people no exaggeration last
[12:36.480 --> 12:41.360]  time I checked Hillary had something like 14 houses one of them was something
[12:41.360 --> 12:48.720]  like 20,000 square feet I had a 4,000 square foot house and downsized it
[12:48.720 --> 12:54.120]  because I just I wasn't using it it was a hassle you imagine a 20,000 square
[12:54.120 --> 12:59.600]  foot house and they don't even put solar panels on them they just bitch it
[12:59.600 --> 13:03.360]  everybody telling us that you know we we should use new innovative energies it's
[13:03.360 --> 13:09.340]  also they control the economy the American Mirror has the photos Hillary
[13:09.340 --> 13:14.840]  Clinton's protective wall around her estate Chappaquita estate and it is just
[13:14.840 --> 13:21.760]  a giant fortress with of course a bunch of black sedans protecting her they've
[13:21.760 --> 13:27.720]  got the guest house filled with the guard it is it not lost on her minions
[13:27.720 --> 13:31.080]  by the way guys let's grab it I saw it this morning on Fox News there's an
[13:31.080 --> 13:38.560]  amazing new in our ad that I want to run on my show for information purposes
[13:38.560 --> 13:43.040]  where it shows her Hillary an actor an actress it looks like Hillary getting on
[13:43.040 --> 13:46.920]  a jet and then she's sitting there giving speeches about you know caring
[13:46.920 --> 13:50.880]  about the average person and the whole point is she has armed guards and you
[13:50.880 --> 13:58.200]  don't so I really want to keep hammering that point we're going to get to ISIS
[13:58.200 --> 14:02.920]  terrorist tells feds he has your hottest brothers in Mexico and this is going on
[14:02.920 --> 14:06.760]  in the exact same area that has been confirmed by judicial watch the FBI and
[14:06.760 --> 14:11.080]  Joe Biggs to have ISIS recruiting centers and mosque operating and they've
[14:11.080 --> 14:15.840]  linked up with the cartels which has been confirmed in arrests that have been
[14:15.840 --> 14:21.960]  made previously so I think it's time to probably deploy Joe Biggs back down
[14:21.960 --> 14:27.840]  there and the FBI met him at the airport he was flying out of that
[14:27.840 --> 14:35.280]  particular city that he was in they're on the Texas side El Paso and they said
[14:35.280 --> 14:38.520]  wow we will not even send agents into where you just went I mean it's the
[14:38.520 --> 14:43.680]  place that were the movie secarios based on that I've talked a lot of folks
[14:43.680 --> 14:46.320]  that have been involved in those missions including family and they say
[14:46.320 --> 14:50.040]  that movie is deadly accurate I mean just bam it's almost like a documentary
[14:50.040 --> 14:54.840]  because they changed the names protect the innocent it is it's a lot of films
[14:54.840 --> 14:59.760]  you go see that you just think of fiction they're not that's why it was so
[14:59.760 --> 15:06.600]  powerful I got nauseated on the film about Gary Webb kill the messenger
[15:06.600 --> 15:12.320]  because I knew Gary Webb and I know that case closely and I know what he went
[15:12.320 --> 15:19.880]  through and and that movie is like a documentary it is sick I have a lot of
[15:19.880 --> 15:26.480]  respect for the director and the folks that funded that film it's a famous
[15:26.480 --> 15:29.600]  actor but I don't really follow Hollywood what's the name runner a lot of
[15:29.600 --> 15:35.160]  respect for that guy not no Josh Brolin's in Sicario the guy that's in kill
[15:35.160 --> 15:39.760]  the messenger he's the famous actor that's a yeah yeah Reiner he got famous
[15:39.760 --> 15:46.280]  in Hurt Locker yeah we're telling we we are Jeremy Renner we are teleprompter
[15:46.280 --> 15:49.080]  free but that doesn't mean sometimes I don't like call on the five six people
[15:49.080 --> 15:53.760]  there go does anybody know this we don't use Google all the time we use our
[15:53.760 --> 16:00.000]  brains yeah but I am digressing there is so much to go over today Americans are
[16:00.000 --> 16:05.600]  still giving up their citizenship at record rates friends of DNC link Sean
[16:05.600 --> 16:13.160]  Lucas who was shooing over Bernie Sanders openly being robbed getting
[16:13.160 --> 16:16.720]  killed his friends are freaked out by that as well they should be
[16:16.720 --> 16:21.200]  obviously the big news top Clinton State Department aid help Clinton Foundation
[16:21.200 --> 16:23.560]  it's come out there's no criminal investigation going on about the
[16:23.560 --> 16:31.120]  Department of Justice and the FBI the problem is we have a lady named Loretta
[16:31.120 --> 16:34.720]  Lynch you won't let any of that go forward so Hillary I'm convinced could
[16:34.720 --> 16:41.280]  eat a child barbecue a baby on the White House lawn and they would say the
[16:41.280 --> 16:48.160]  baby deserved it the baby was racist or something long as it's a white baby 45
[16:48.160 --> 16:53.400]  times Secretary Clinton pushed the trade bill she now opposes I'm gonna play a
[16:53.400 --> 16:56.840]  few of these I mean there's 45 of them and in the interest of time I'm not gonna
[16:56.840 --> 17:02.560]  play at all but here's Hillary yesterday giving her plagiarized speech
[17:02.560 --> 17:10.960]  basically from Trump when she's one of the main authors of NAFTA of GATT of
[17:10.960 --> 17:17.320]  globalism of these one-sided deals that's on record and then we have her all
[17:17.320 --> 17:23.160]  these dozens and dozens and dozens of times however many dozens 45 is saying
[17:23.160 --> 17:27.280]  she's for the TPP and of course it's okay that Obama's for it some foreign
[17:27.280 --> 17:32.840]  group unelected raping us economically further because he went on a late show
[17:32.840 --> 17:37.440]  and they sang a song a jazz song and he goes you down with TPP and Obama said
[17:37.440 --> 17:42.640]  you know me that's cool jazz guys up there with saxophone yeah well yeah it's
[17:42.640 --> 17:48.040]  fun it's fun to get screwed over so let's hear from Hillary a few years ago
[17:48.040 --> 17:54.160]  well let's hear from her yesterday first I will stop any trade deal that kills
[17:54.160 --> 18:01.480]  jobs or holds down wages including the trans-pacific partnership
[18:05.680 --> 18:11.400]  she nods her head I oppose it now I'll oppose it after the election and I'll
[18:11.400 --> 18:15.920]  oppose it as president notice she said though any deal that isn't good she'll
[18:15.920 --> 18:19.680]  do whatever she wants now let's go to just part of the 45 times I'm not gonna
[18:19.680 --> 18:23.240]  play at all but this is her over the last five six years here it is the United
[18:23.240 --> 18:27.660]  States is engaging in the trans-pacific partnership trade negotiations
[18:27.660 --> 18:32.040]  we're pursuing a regional agreement with the nations of the trans-pacific

[24:06.140 --> 24:15.420]  this morning I woke up early at about 5 a.m. and couldn't go back to sleep and
[24:15.420 --> 24:18.940]  as often do when I can't sleep I went in and looked at my children as I slept in
[24:18.940 --> 24:25.580]  bed I thought to myself am I doing the right thing obviously in
[24:25.580 --> 24:30.660]  dangering my name my treasure my life when I'm their father and they need me
[24:30.660 --> 24:36.100]  to be here and then I just fall back on the fact that in my gut in my spirit I
[24:36.100 --> 24:38.900]  know it's the right thing to do to take a risk individually and even for my
[24:38.900 --> 24:50.380]  family because we're gonna lose everything if we don't make a stand and I
[24:50.380 --> 24:54.700]  say this a lot because it's so true this isn't rhetoric the globalist are the
[24:54.700 --> 25:01.340]  most manipulative evil people the world has ever seen and that's not my
[25:01.340 --> 25:09.900]  opinion that's a fact there is a great global awakening happening the
[25:09.900 --> 25:13.300]  controlled media the weaponized media the enemy media is there to make you
[25:13.300 --> 25:19.300]  feel like you're alone and that you don't count and that we're losing well
[25:19.300 --> 25:23.100]  we're not that's why they're so scared of something simple like a Hilary for
[25:23.100 --> 25:25.820]  prison shirt all over the country they're trying to persecute college
[25:25.820 --> 25:29.340]  students and junior high students and others and it becomes local news stories
[25:29.340 --> 25:36.300]  and they prevail they win because when we resist it makes the establishment show
[25:36.300 --> 25:44.780]  its true colors and then they fail it's only when we submit do they get away
[25:44.780 --> 25:48.860]  with this and I think about Hillary Clinton on all the stacks of news I've
[25:48.860 --> 25:54.780]  got here she at the State Department was one of the main negotiators in
[25:54.780 --> 26:00.180]  quarterbacks but I've got to say the most important other than Obama she's the
[26:00.180 --> 26:04.260]  second most important in the last eight years globally pushing the Transmissive
[26:04.260 --> 26:10.580]  Partnership Obama every month was flying off to try to ram this sucker
[26:10.580 --> 26:14.700]  through and then Congress member couldn't even see it for years and then
[26:14.700 --> 26:18.380]  finally could you could spend one hour but couldn't take photos of the
[26:18.380 --> 26:24.740]  documents thousands of pages you know wheelbarrows full whole room full of it
[26:24.740 --> 26:31.260]  just garbage one-sided deals that we can't even see that transfer our power
[26:31.260 --> 26:34.820]  the multinationals we now have a copy of it it's a nightmare it just writes a
[26:34.820 --> 26:40.700]  blank check to do whatever you want just like Obamacare and then Hillary sits up
[26:40.700 --> 26:48.780]  there like it's a big joke and says that she will not support the TPP now or in
[26:48.780 --> 26:59.140]  the future or basically ever when she is its mama just like she's the mama of
[26:59.140 --> 27:05.420]  ISIS she brought them in she set them up in Syria she brought them in she set
[27:05.420 --> 27:10.460]  them up in Libya in Egypt in Iraq on record those are the emails coming out
[27:10.460 --> 27:13.940]  the WikiLeaks is about to release I don't need all those emails we know the
[27:13.940 --> 27:19.460]  trips for order to do it we've had the whistleblowers on members of the Senate
[27:19.460 --> 27:24.260]  have gone public it's all a fact the head of defense intelligence has gone
[27:24.260 --> 27:36.100]  public general Flynn and a Saan's things that'll get her arrested or indicted you
[27:36.100 --> 27:40.020]  see here's what happened people in the military and even NATO said we're not
[27:40.020 --> 27:46.260]  shipping high-impact weapons to a hobbyist flying frickin al-Qaeda flags
[27:46.260 --> 27:53.380]  there is no god but Allah it's it's the Wahabi flag it's the al-Qaeda flag because
[27:53.380 --> 27:56.660]  they land and start off loading them and these guys were so arrogant they would
[27:56.660 --> 27:59.740]  I've talked to the people that have witnessed it we're gonna kill you next
[27:59.740 --> 28:04.140]  and they're very crazy and there was just total breakdown five years ago in
[28:04.140 --> 28:13.620]  the military and they were ordered to do this and then Trump comes out and talks
[28:13.620 --> 28:17.580]  about it and they act like he's crazy and then I was thinking back because we're
[28:17.580 --> 28:20.380]  going to get in clips from a few years ago I was calling her the founder of
[28:20.380 --> 28:25.460]  ISIS we're about to play those clips coming up we've dug them up and we've
[28:25.460 --> 28:30.260]  got clips of Hillary saying Donald Trump's the founder in fact prints some
[28:30.260 --> 28:36.580]  articles for me folks remember that two three years ago she said he right when
[28:36.580 --> 28:39.900]  he first started running like a year and a half ago she said he's the recruiter
[28:39.900 --> 28:44.420]  he's the head of ISIS remember all that crap so they're saying he's a cook for
[28:44.420 --> 28:48.380]  saying about her when she actually did it
[28:51.060 --> 28:56.220]  it's amazing but but here's just one more negative her saying the TPP is the
[28:56.220 --> 29:02.340]  gold standard but now she's fighting it now she was never for it won't be for it
[29:02.340 --> 29:07.020]  and won't be for it in the future here's a clip so it's fair to say that our
[29:07.020 --> 29:13.940]  economies are entwined and we need to keep upping our game both bilaterally
[29:13.940 --> 29:18.420]  and with partners across the region through agreements like the trans-
[29:18.420 --> 29:25.620]  Pacific partnership or TPP Australia is a critical partner this TPP sets the
[29:25.620 --> 29:32.060]  gold standard and trade agreements to open free transparent fair trade the
[29:32.060 --> 29:38.100]  kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field and when
[29:38.100 --> 29:44.580]  negotiated this agreement will cover 40% of the world's total trade and build in
[29:44.580 --> 29:49.380]  strong protections for workers and the environment oh yes and now we got a
[29:49.380 --> 29:53.060]  copy of it the worst thing I've seen fires on the run like it allows slavery
[29:53.060 --> 29:57.980]  Alex Jones actually allows slavery radio network
[29:59.140 --> 30:04.860]  Joe Biggs here with info wars.com article up by express let refugees into

[30:15.500 --> 30:19.740]  be fine there are currently 147 reception centers across France but
[30:19.740 --> 30:24.140]  these are all in massive demand as desperate refugees continue to flee the
[30:24.140 --> 30:28.300]  Middle East meanwhile Barack Obama wants to bring these people into our
[30:28.300 --> 30:33.420]  country unvetted let's not let any more of this happen that's why we need Donald
[30:33.420 --> 30:37.660]  Trump to secure the borders and we need a better vet these people look you have
[30:37.660 --> 30:41.940]  families in Germany fleeing their country the same country the angle of
[30:41.940 --> 30:45.660]  Merkel is allowing these people to come into and they are now going to Russia
[30:45.660 --> 30:51.540]  seeking asylum from these craze people who most of them want Sharia law open
[30:51.540 --> 30:54.940]  your eyes if we don't secure our borders here in America what we're seeing
[30:54.940 --> 30:58.700]  happen over in Europe will happen here this has been Joe Biggs with info wars

[33:33.740 --> 33:43.740]  we're gonna be breaking down today election fraud in this country we're
[33:43.740 --> 33:50.700]  also going to be getting into several articles at Paul Joseph Watson has been
[33:50.700 --> 33:55.940]  writing on the different mysterious deaths people filing lawsuits being
[33:55.940 --> 34:00.660]  found killed people that are IT specialists being found shot in the
[34:00.660 --> 34:05.620]  back multiple times we're going to be breaking all of that down here today as
[34:05.620 --> 34:14.340]  the Clinton body count only seems to expand and get worse by the minute we've
[34:14.340 --> 34:18.340]  also have Donald Trump coming on the last few weeks and saying we should be
[34:18.340 --> 34:21.540]  worried about election fraud they're rigging Google they're rigging Facebook
[34:21.540 --> 34:28.300]  they're rigging Twitter they are rigging polls on record they've got all sorts of
[34:28.300 --> 34:32.740]  different programs out there to manipulate how they do these polls
[34:32.740 --> 34:41.260]  they're declaring Trump unfit foreign leaders the Pope the president but they
[34:41.260 --> 34:44.820]  won't try to steal the election from an election day Roger Stone's here to talk
[34:44.820 --> 34:50.540]  with us about that here in a moment and more there's also a CBS news story
[34:50.540 --> 34:59.540]  hackers demonstrate how voting machines can be compromised and then it just goes
[34:59.540 --> 35:03.900]  into long admitted history of massive fraud and the fact that every major
[35:03.900 --> 35:08.660]  election has been compromised at one level or another by the media
[35:08.660 --> 35:13.380]  consortium formerly known as voter news services it has a new name and then a
[35:13.380 --> 35:17.300]  new name it's always changing its names you can't find it that announces who the
[35:17.300 --> 35:22.660]  winners are and coordinates at the state level so we'll talk about that with
[35:22.660 --> 35:29.460]  Roger Stone here in just a moment before I go any further this broadcast is
[35:29.460 --> 35:37.900]  listeners supported this broadcast operates thanks to what you do and
[35:37.900 --> 35:43.780]  that's why we sell items that I personally have checked out that I
[35:43.780 --> 35:48.820]  personally use and I know are a great deal whether it is nutraceuticals or
[35:48.820 --> 35:56.020]  whether it's a Hillary for prison shirt all of it is either good for you
[35:56.020 --> 36:01.260]  something very useful in your life or something that helps basically expose
[36:01.260 --> 36:06.140]  the corruption that's taking place we've got 33% off on solar base stations and
[36:06.140 --> 36:10.860]  solar panels highest quality units out there very low prices we've got
[36:10.860 --> 36:17.820]  specials going on colloidal silver 50% off on silver bullet unheard of 995 the
[36:17.820 --> 36:24.700]  exact same stuff under another label sold at Whole Foods for over $20 we have a
[36:24.700 --> 36:29.020]  lot of other specials that are running as well 20% off on Alexa pure gravity-fed
[36:29.020 --> 36:31.860]  water filters
[36:31.860 --> 36:41.660]  without your support obviously we will not be able to continue on we're doing
[36:41.660 --> 36:45.180]  pretty good right now but I've put on all sale that's an old naval term for
[36:45.180 --> 36:49.260]  back in the days of sailing ships put on all the sales you can to try to go as
[36:49.260 --> 36:52.780]  fast as you can to try to hire as many crew members as we can and writers and
[36:52.780 --> 36:57.180]  researchers to fight the globalists and to take on the New World Order and and
[36:57.180 --> 37:03.140]  right now you can see that in full wars is right there at the tip of the spear
[37:03.140 --> 37:06.700]  punching through the media narrative punching through their lies and
[37:06.700 --> 37:10.940]  injecting reality whether it's Hillary being the founder of ISIS that's on
[37:10.940 --> 37:14.100]  record or whether it's the fact that there's election fraud and rigged
[37:14.100 --> 37:19.340]  polls that's on record and we're punching that out there over and over and
[37:19.340 --> 37:22.940]  over again you the audience of the show are the reason we're so effective so I
[37:22.940 --> 37:27.020]  want to salute you I want to thank you and I want to just tell you that you're
[37:27.020 --> 37:29.780]  continued support is absolutely essential to the fight against the
[37:29.780 --> 37:35.180]  globalist info wars store.com or info wars live.com or simply call toll free
[37:35.180 --> 37:48.740]  888-253-3139 now going to Roger Stone Roger Stone of stonezone.com so much has
[37:48.740 --> 37:51.820]  happened since I talked to you Sunday I've thrown a lot of topics a lot of
[37:51.820 --> 37:56.140]  issues where should we start what's what's front and center well it's very
[37:56.140 --> 38:00.700]  hard to know where to start Alex I mean first of all you have the question of
[38:00.700 --> 38:08.740]  voter fraud more precisely election theft I mean voter fraud itself while not
[38:08.740 --> 38:14.740]  non-existent as the left would tell you is essentially more limited the larger
[38:14.740 --> 38:20.780]  problem here is election theft the manipulation of what used to be known
[38:20.780 --> 38:28.060]  as the Daibold machines in common usage across the country now if the Clintons
[38:28.060 --> 38:33.340]  would steal the election from Bernie Sanders the nomination as the DNC
[38:33.340 --> 38:39.420]  WikiLeaks proved they did why would they not steal the election from Donald
[38:39.420 --> 38:45.700]  Trump if they can I know among political elites they poo poo this idea but from a
[38:45.700 --> 38:51.620]  technological point of view this stunning video put up by CBS not right
[38:51.620 --> 38:59.340]  bar not town ball not daily caller not info wars CBS shows how simple and easy
[38:59.340 --> 39:06.420]  it is to program the voting machines for a desired result the polls the
[39:06.420 --> 39:11.380]  manipulation of the polls lawyers got caught red-handed a number of others
[39:11.380 --> 39:16.780]  have that's the precursor to the fix of the machines in other words you
[39:16.780 --> 39:23.340]  condition people to expect a Clinton victory and then you deliver that exact
[39:23.340 --> 39:29.020]  victory in the polls how can this be combat is the question most Trump
[39:29.020 --> 39:34.020]  supporters asked me and there are several ways first of all in the window
[39:34.020 --> 39:40.460]  that we have 60 days I advocate registering locating and registering a
[39:40.460 --> 39:46.780]  million new Trump voters in the very states that will be up as a potential to
[39:46.780 --> 39:55.700]  be stolen you can go to restore it exactly right restore America's greatness
[39:55.700 --> 40:02.100]  or where there's a very active effort to locate and registered new Trump voters
[40:02.100 --> 40:08.540]  in states like Ohio and Pennsylvania and Jersey and Colorado and Iowa and
[40:08.540 --> 40:13.700]  others that will be up for grabs secondarily we're going to need an
[40:13.700 --> 40:19.780]  army of trained poll watch people who know what to look for I am seeking to
[40:19.780 --> 40:25.060]  contact and retain some of the country's leading experts on the computer
[40:25.060 --> 40:33.500]  manipulation of these machines to advise us and then lastly I think it is very
[40:33.500 --> 40:41.660]  important that every single Trump voter be found and turned out I don't have the
[40:41.660 --> 40:46.780]  confidence that the Trump campaign will be able to cover every precinct but I
[40:46.780 --> 40:52.040]  think perhaps with grassroots assistance and they will be so we will be
[40:52.040 --> 40:58.580]  unveiling a comprehensive program shortly to combat this election that
[40:58.580 --> 41:04.140]  speaking of that CBF news report hacker demonstrates how voting machines can be
[41:04.140 --> 41:09.580]  compromised if you go to YouTube and type in election fraud US you will see
[41:09.580 --> 41:13.540]  hundreds of newscasts hundreds of experts die bold chief engineers
[41:13.540 --> 41:18.580]  congressional legislature testimony local legislators in Florida and Ohio and
[41:18.580 --> 41:22.940]  certified fraud admitted fraud and I mean I mean there's famous examples but
[41:22.940 --> 41:27.300]  for Obama to go election fraud what's that I mean it's like Hillary's saying
[41:27.300 --> 41:31.420]  what's turkey you know when the armed services committee asked her about the
[41:31.420 --> 41:35.580]  Turkish ambassador I mean they just play stupid over and over and over again
[41:35.580 --> 41:39.660]  here's a clip from that CBS news piece I gotta say good job for CBS news actually
[41:39.660 --> 41:43.660]  doing some real reporting concerns are growing this morning over the possibility
[41:43.660 --> 41:48.420]  of a hack presidential election experts believe a cyber attack this year could be
[41:48.420 --> 41:53.900]  a reality especially following the hack of DNC emails the ranking member of the
[41:53.900 --> 41:57.860]  Senate Homeland Security Committee sent a letter Monday to the Homeland Security
[41:57.860 --> 42:02.820]  Secretary it said in part election security is critical and a cyber attack
[42:02.820 --> 42:06.980]  by foreign actors on our election systems could compromise the integrity of
[42:06.980 --> 42:11.900]  our voting process Maria Villarreal is in Los Angeles to show us how this could
[42:11.900 --> 42:17.300]  happen and if there is a fix Maria good morning well good morning roughly 70%
[42:17.300 --> 42:21.900]  of the states in the US use some form of electronic voting machine hackers tell
[42:21.900 --> 42:25.820]  me the problems with these machines have been around for years the system and
[42:25.820 --> 42:29.620]  the computer are both old and antiquated with millions expected to hit the
[42:29.620 --> 42:33.700]  polls in just three short months for the presidential election security experts
[42:33.700 --> 42:38.180]  are now raising some red flags and I'm afraid the elections gonna be rigged I
[42:38.180 --> 42:42.540]  have to be honest for weeks Donald Trump has told his supporters the outcome of
[42:42.540 --> 42:47.940]  the 2016 election could be out of his control but for the hackers at
[42:47.940 --> 42:52.540]  semantic security response election day results could be manipulated by an
[42:52.540 --> 42:57.420]  affordable device you can find online I can insert it and then it resets the
[42:57.420 --> 43:01.460]  card and now I'm able to vote again the voter doesn't even need to leave the
[43:01.460 --> 43:06.140]  booth to hack the machine and how much does that cost $15 so for $15 I could
[43:06.140 --> 43:09.900]  hack the vote for $15 and in-depth knowledge of the card you could hack
[43:09.900 --> 43:14.220]  the vote semantic director Kevin Haley says elections can also be hacked by
[43:14.220 --> 43:18.540]  breaking into the machines after the votes are collected the results go from
[43:18.540 --> 43:23.420]  that machine into a piece of electronics that takes it to the central counting
[43:23.420 --> 43:27.900]  place that data is not encrypted and that's vulnerable for manipulation how
[43:27.900 --> 43:33.900]  big of a hacking potential problem is this well there's a huge potential there
[43:33.900 --> 43:37.660]  are so many places in the voting process once it goes electronic that's
[43:37.660 --> 43:42.060]  vulnerable according to a report from the Brennan Center for Justice one reason
[43:42.060 --> 43:46.780]  these voting systems are so vulnerable is their age we found that more than 40
[43:46.780 --> 43:50.860]  states are using voting machines that are at least 10 years old our system is
[43:50.860 --> 43:54.620]  as secure as we can possibly make it Denise Merrill president of the
[43:54.620 --> 43:58.900]  National Association of Secretaries of State says the lack of funding keeps
[43:58.900 --> 44:03.180]  most precincts from updating their systems but all machines have to meet
[44:03.180 --> 44:08.380]  specific government standards the idea of a national hack of some sort is
[44:08.380 --> 44:13.460]  almost ridiculous because there is no national system in fact the more than
[44:13.460 --> 44:18.020]  9,000 voting districts across the country all have different ways of running
[44:18.020 --> 44:22.060]  their elections down to the type of machine they use the Merrill says there
[44:22.060 --> 44:27.460]  are checks in place to prevent fraud our voting systems are heavily regulated
[44:27.460 --> 44:32.940]  they're tested both before and after there are paper trails everywhere by in
[44:32.940 --> 44:38.300]  large I would say the American election system works very well CBS learned
[44:38.300 --> 44:42.460]  that only 60% of states routinely conduct audits post-election by checking
[44:42.460 --> 44:46.500]  paper trails but not all states even have paper records like in some parts of
[44:46.500 --> 44:50.180]  swing states like Virginia and Pennsylvania which experts say could be
[44:50.180 --> 44:54.100]  devastating the election assistance Commission told us that they ensure all
[44:54.100 --> 44:57.740]  voting systems are vigorously tested against security standards
[44:57.740 --> 45:02.620]  standards and that systems certified by the EAC are not connected to the
[45:02.620 --> 45:06.460]  internet Gail well listen a hundred days we're going to the polls thank you
[45:06.460 --> 45:09.420]  Maria very much all right I'm gonna go back to Roger Stone on this but he
[45:09.420 --> 45:12.300]  wanted us to air this piece and I'm glad we did now I say good job admitting
[45:12.300 --> 45:16.060]  at least that these machines are easy to hack there's it's been had it's happened
[45:16.060 --> 45:19.420]  many times but at the end they totally deceived the public maybe they're
[45:19.420 --> 45:26.620]  ignorant so let me enlighten CBS right now right after Kennedy got killed they
[45:26.620 --> 45:30.340]  started having the Associated Press coordinate with the states and then it
[45:30.340 --> 45:33.900]  would announce who the winner was then they changed the name in 1990 to voter
[45:33.900 --> 45:37.820]  news services and by the way Mr. Stone has been part of famous recounts at the
[45:37.820 --> 45:40.620]  highest level so he's an expert we'll speak to him in a moment skip the break
[45:40.620 --> 45:45.740]  to have more time but every major election if you just google voter news
[45:45.740 --> 45:50.500]  services they've had so many problems they changed the name in 2003 to national
[45:50.500 --> 45:55.380]  election pool but was set up by the exact same group so again it was AP
[45:55.380 --> 45:59.500]  announced that Bernie Sanders was gonna win by a certain point the day before
[45:59.500 --> 46:03.300]  because they quote met with the super delegates at a rich person's house oh I
[46:03.300 --> 46:08.300]  see but they went ahead with the election what they do is they will fix it in
[46:08.300 --> 46:16.860]  key battleground states steal it and then have it called by this private
[46:16.860 --> 46:21.660]  consortium headed up by AP to go ahead and announce hands down what's happened
[46:21.660 --> 46:25.580]  and then later it's hard to do a recount now that's a layperson's breakdown of
[46:25.580 --> 46:29.660]  that roger stonestonezone.com former campaign head for Trump but is that
[46:29.660 --> 46:33.500]  pretty accurate what I just said? Yeah I think everything you said is accurate I
[46:33.500 --> 46:38.060]  make a couple points about the CBS video first of all it's not foreign actors I'm
[46:38.060 --> 46:43.820]  worried about it's domestic actors those who have custody machines but the woman
[46:43.820 --> 46:47.340]  at the end of that video who says well the machines are heavily regulated
[46:47.340 --> 46:53.660]  exactly it's the regulators I'm worried about so for example the DIBOL PES
[46:53.660 --> 46:58.700]  machine is in wide use in California they're in the custody of the secretary
[46:58.700 --> 47:03.540]  of state I attempted to reach him his name is Alex Padilla I couldn't find him
[47:03.540 --> 47:09.100]  unfortunately he was out campaigning for Hillary Clinton I remember well when
[47:09.100 --> 47:13.740]  the Democrats went out of their mind because the Florida secretary of state
[47:13.740 --> 47:19.340]  Catherine Harris was actively campaigning and had a title in the Bush
[47:19.340 --> 47:25.500]  campaign but you have an identical situation here in California the machines
[47:25.500 --> 47:31.260]  are fixed after the fact they keep the same number of votes they just
[47:31.260 --> 47:37.500]  rejigger total and they've already laid the groundwork by manipulation of the
[47:37.500 --> 47:43.380]  polls unfortunately this is also how you detect the fraud if you take an honest
[47:43.380 --> 47:49.540]  poll and we intend to do that and then compare the results on a precinct basis
[47:49.540 --> 47:57.180]  or an subdivision basis and the swing from the poll to the final results defies
[47:57.180 --> 48:04.420]  the mathematical odds given the time frame then you have prima facie evidence
[48:04.420 --> 48:10.420]  of fraud on its face you have it and expanding on that Roger Stone exit polls
[48:10.420 --> 48:14.100]  for my research are generally depending on who conducts them three to five percent
[48:14.100 --> 48:18.700]  margin of error very accurate so we need to conduct exit polls in these key
[48:18.700 --> 48:23.500]  precincts key battlegrounds to immediately cry foul if something doesn't
[48:23.500 --> 48:28.940]  show up that we expect to see from the real polls very definitely a part of
[48:28.940 --> 48:33.980]  the of the plan that we are putting together to protect Donald Trump from
[48:33.980 --> 48:39.100]  election rating Trump himself I think he's played a vital role already raising
[48:39.100 --> 48:45.020]  awareness by heightening public awareness to this very real problem I mean it is
[48:45.020 --> 48:52.140]  almost laughable in terms of last couple days now it's first of all I myself have
[48:52.140 --> 48:57.420]  been hacked into my personal accounts my business accounts my political work a
[48:57.420 --> 49:03.180]  number of my bank accounts have been accessed all within the last 48 hours as
[49:03.180 --> 49:09.260]  soon as it became publicly known that I was in communication with Julian Assange
[49:09.260 --> 49:15.460]  now there is a massive effort on Twitter and Facebook to discredit Assange
[49:15.460 --> 49:20.780]  that's because the Clintonistas know that Mr. Assange who I believe is a hero
[49:20.780 --> 49:26.660]  who's fighting the deep police state they know Mr. Assange has all of the
[49:26.660 --> 49:32.820]  emails that Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills Hillary's flunkies thought they
[49:32.820 --> 49:38.740]  erased now if those emails were worth taking the public heat we're having a
[49:38.740 --> 49:44.900]  race of them it tells you that what's in them is extraordinarily significant so
[49:44.900 --> 49:50.180]  now there is a giant effort online Roger Stone hacked up we're talking this
[49:50.180 --> 49:53.900]  you know well I tell you I'm just trying to think of the headline I should go
[49:53.900 --> 50:00.660]  with here Roger Stone hacked after talking to Assange I mean this is like
[50:00.660 --> 50:06.100]  an espionage movie and then we've got Democratic press communications PR
[50:06.100 --> 50:12.260]  agent hired to shut down Seth Rich conspiracy theories as a top consultant
[50:12.260 --> 50:17.580]  that works for the Clintons this guy shot four times in the back high level
[50:17.580 --> 50:23.700]  dealing with the emails and then Assange telegraphs on Dutch TV that he's the
[50:23.700 --> 50:29.140]  source and that these bombshells are about to come out this is amazing yeah
[50:29.140 --> 50:34.620]  there's so there is a there is a giant effort online this is the these are the
[50:34.620 --> 50:40.860]  torps and correct the record constantly saying that we the Trump supporters are
[50:40.860 --> 50:46.860]  trying to stage a constitutional crisis based on rigging this election I say to
[50:46.860 --> 50:51.020]  you know Alex those who are causing the constitutional crisis are the ones who
[50:51.020 --> 50:56.780]  are rigging the machines all we want is an honest count if we have an honest
[50:56.780 --> 51:01.660]  count there's no question in my mind that Donald Trump despite the beating he's
[51:01.660 --> 51:06.340]  taking for the mainstream media distorting and twisting focusing on
[51:06.340 --> 51:12.020]  everything he says while giving Hillary largely a free pass on the startling
[51:12.020 --> 51:16.740]  revelations that she's now under investigation through their foundation of
[51:16.740 --> 51:23.300]  the IRS that she did indeed arm ISIS I mean come off of it David Rock she
[51:23.300 --> 51:28.100]  armed ISIS it's an undisputable fact no matter how many I was about to say they
[51:28.100 --> 51:32.380]  can't run from this I mean there's a sense of this is just mounting by the
[51:32.380 --> 51:36.980]  minute and then real liberals like Assange who exposed Bush for bad stuff
[51:36.980 --> 51:40.540]  and we thank him for that I said well no if he's for real if he goes after
[51:40.540 --> 51:45.100]  Obama and Hillary he's been doing that and I tell you he's a real hero I wish
[51:45.100 --> 51:48.820]  he would go ahead and release the data dump now I understand it might have more
[51:48.820 --> 51:51.700]  power if he did it a month before the election but I tell you we need to bring
[51:51.700 --> 51:57.380]  Hillary down now Roger well I think he may choose to release it before each one
[51:57.380 --> 52:02.580]  of the debates release some emails just before the debate so that you're
[52:02.580 --> 52:05.620]  safety and everybody's safe because obviously they hit your emails and took
[52:05.620 --> 52:08.980]  over your bank accounts everything governmental level to find out what
[52:08.980 --> 52:13.900]  you're up to what you're doing just everybody's safety did Assange give you
[52:13.900 --> 52:18.100]  any info because I think if you've got it you've got to put it out now I'm not
[52:18.100 --> 52:24.220]  at liberty discuss what I have and I kind of have a foreshadowing but nobody
[52:24.220 --> 52:28.420]  affects Julian Assange nobody tells this guy what to do he is a he
[52:28.420 --> 52:31.740]  understand obviously no one's implying that what I'm saying is because I mean
[52:31.740 --> 52:34.780]  we we haven't talked about this because I only talk about stuff like this on
[52:34.780 --> 52:39.020]  record if I was Assange you'd be a smart guy to give some data caches to and I'd
[52:39.020 --> 52:43.580]  be giving it to hundreds of trusted people right now well I lost some data
[52:43.580 --> 52:48.980]  in the in the hacking some things that I was about to publish manuscript for my
[52:48.980 --> 52:53.980]  next book on the Clintons has been stolen some other items nothing that is
[52:53.980 --> 52:59.580]  not recoverable but for example my entire contact list people I deal with
[52:59.580 --> 53:04.740]  regularly is wiped out it's gone you don't like to bitch a complaint but we
[53:04.740 --> 53:08.220]  have to report this as a war you're being audited you've paid them and they're
[53:08.220 --> 53:13.380]  just saying you didn't pay your taxes to the IRS is harassing me over 2014 I
[53:13.380 --> 53:17.300]  paid all my taxes and everything oh they just say that they're ignoring your
[53:17.300 --> 53:19.900]  check they're ignoring the cash check and your turn they just say you're a
[53:19.900 --> 53:23.380]  criminal and you didn't pay well first of all I've been through this somebody
[53:23.380 --> 53:28.620]  filed a false return in my name that means when I went to file my return
[53:28.620 --> 53:34.260]  online the system kicked me out I had to hire an attorney we filed the correct
[53:34.260 --> 53:39.140]  forms and we paid our taxes this is all documented in writing the
[53:39.140 --> 53:44.260]  correspondence between my lawyer and the IRS now the IRS has amnesia like
[53:44.260 --> 53:48.220]  none of this happened we're right back where we were you never paid your 2014
[53:48.220 --> 53:52.420]  taxes despite the fact that I look cancel check and all this correspondence
[53:52.420 --> 53:57.100]  no it's harassment it's amazing and they are pulling out all the stops folks I
[53:57.100 --> 54:02.820]  mean you I mean it is incredible let's get down to brass tax here what is the
[54:02.820 --> 54:07.020]  true nature of the polls I mean I see somebody that are frauds but the same
[54:07.020 --> 54:10.820]  time I don't want to discount them all from from internal polling from your
[54:10.820 --> 54:14.180]  own research where are Trump and Hillary right now in the general election but
[54:14.180 --> 54:18.060]  also what about those battleground states is he really losing ground there
[54:18.060 --> 54:22.540]  there's no evidence that he is he remains in range there he is ahead in some of
[54:22.540 --> 54:25.900]  the battleground states still I believe he's still ahead in Florida by a point
[54:25.900 --> 54:31.820]  or two he's behind in others the gap is not nine points it's not 15 points in
[54:31.820 --> 54:38.060]  every case he's within range I must tell you I never expected in this race for
[54:38.060 --> 54:43.180]  him to be ahead of Hillary until the end my rating was never explain that
[54:43.180 --> 54:45.580]  phenomenon you've been saying that for over a year here on the show that you
[54:45.580 --> 54:49.100]  think it's gonna be tight till the end well first of all you have so many
[54:49.100 --> 54:54.780]  cataclysmic and in big level events here the debates are going to change the
[54:54.780 --> 55:00.140]  numbers miss whatever mr. Assange drops and Trump's and Hillary's reaction to it
[55:00.140 --> 55:05.340]  could change the number the country is almost evenly matched between left and
[55:05.340 --> 55:09.500]  right they've done a better job over the years of voter registration than the
[55:09.500 --> 55:14.460]  Republicans have ever done there is also now a growing chasm between Trump and
[55:14.460 --> 55:17.660]  the Republican National Committee because I was about to raise that though
[55:17.660 --> 55:21.340]  we've got he's the main fundraiser he's bringing in big money now and you've
[55:21.340 --> 55:25.660]  got the old Republican establishment saying take the money away from Trump
[55:25.660 --> 55:29.660]  give him nothing they're openly trying to sabotage things for Hillary because
[55:29.660 --> 55:32.700]  he'll just quit recruiting and getting money and then that'll hurt all the
[55:32.700 --> 55:37.260]  Republicans they're obvious saboteurs well but the other thing is true is we
[55:37.260 --> 55:41.820]  cannot reach agreement in terms of who wants to be targeted in other words there
[55:41.820 --> 55:46.300]  are blue collar union member democratic votes out there
[55:46.300 --> 55:49.660]  who will go for Donald Trump but will probably not vote for the balance of
[55:49.660 --> 55:53.340]  the Republican ticket if you're in the Trump campaign if you're in the Trump
[55:53.340 --> 55:57.500]  camp as I am you want those voters contacted and turned out
[55:57.500 --> 56:00.460]  the republican national no strategically we need Trump
[56:00.460 --> 56:04.540]  strategically we need Trump we can't trust new crops of republicans that get
[56:04.540 --> 56:09.180]  you know taken over every time indeed and and they just want to turn out the
[56:09.180 --> 56:12.620]  republican vote in order to protect their congressional
[56:12.620 --> 56:15.580]  incumbents virginia is a perfect example of this
[56:15.580 --> 56:19.500]  Trump has great fuss over appeal that the rest of the party ticket
[56:19.500 --> 56:22.940]  does not have we need to be targeting Trump voters
[56:22.940 --> 56:28.940]  not republicans roger stone other points that need to be gotten into here
[56:28.940 --> 56:32.380]  look they hire this top democrat crisis manager
[56:32.380 --> 56:36.460]  uh to quote take over statements for the family in seth
[56:36.460 --> 56:41.340]  uh death seth rich's death uh we have other folks friends of dc linked lawyer
[56:41.340 --> 56:43.820]  that was suing over it being stolen from bernie
[56:43.820 --> 56:47.820]  sean lucas freaked out by his death we've got a bunch of other deaths going on
[56:47.820 --> 56:54.140]  i mean this smells yeah you have you have how it's the deaths of seth rich
[56:54.140 --> 56:59.020]  john ash and sean lucas uh in short order all of them connected
[56:59.020 --> 57:02.300]  to the heist of the democratic national nomination
[57:02.300 --> 57:07.340]  by uh hillary with the inside mole assistance of debris
[57:07.340 --> 57:13.580]  waserman schultz so and when you raise this publicly these are three deaths
[57:13.580 --> 57:16.940]  you're immediately smeared as a conspiracy theorist
[57:16.940 --> 57:21.100]  well if over one death perhaps you'd say all right a coincidence
[57:21.100 --> 57:25.980]  three deaths really i don't think it's a reasonable scratch your head and say
[57:25.980 --> 57:29.340]  why are three insiders with intimate knowledge
[57:29.340 --> 57:33.740]  of the machinations at the dnc that stole this nomination for hillary
[57:33.740 --> 57:38.620]  uh now pushing up daisies that's up in time i'll tell you this asanj has got
[57:38.620 --> 57:43.340]  giant uh eggs because if you look at this he knows it's
[57:43.340 --> 57:46.700]  hurting hillary she's degenerating under the stress daily whatever's in these
[57:46.700 --> 57:49.580]  emails has got her scared to death you can see it
[57:49.580 --> 57:54.860]  she looks like a cornered hairless rat uh they're totally freaking out and asanj
[57:54.860 --> 57:57.100]  is just pushing and playing chicken with these folks
[57:57.100 --> 58:01.740]  this is such a historic time well beyond that it's very clear that hillary's
[58:01.740 --> 58:05.580]  health is not good um i have reasonably
[58:05.580 --> 58:09.820]  documents uh that were leaked recently from the hospital in
[58:09.820 --> 58:12.540]  mciskill new york which is close to capillar
[58:12.540 --> 58:17.100]  are oh you believe those documents are real i believe that they are i am still
[58:17.100 --> 58:23.020]  researching it i'm not finished but um the physical evidence just the video
[58:23.020 --> 58:26.860]  you can watch over and now this mysterious african-american
[58:26.860 --> 58:31.020]  doctor who is with her at all times he runs around with the with the tranquilizer dart
[58:31.020 --> 58:33.980]  hold on i want to see if we can do five more minutes with us for maybe longer
[58:33.980 --> 58:37.660]  roger stone there's so much to cover stonezone.com we have the new
[58:37.660 --> 58:41.020]  shirt they designed at the clinton rapes shirt in four store.com thank you for
[58:41.020 --> 58:49.820]  listening to gcm visit gcmlive.com today
[58:49.820 --> 58:53.500]  if you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator but we're
[58:53.500 --> 58:57.100]  waiting for an outrageously low price you are not going to want to miss this
[58:57.100 --> 59:00.140]  important message here's why my friends we already see
[59:00.140 --> 59:03.900]  major power grid problems and it's getting worse so please listen
[59:03.900 --> 59:07.500]  solar generators really do provide life-saving electrical power
[59:07.500 --> 59:10.700]  and unlike gas generators solar generators run silently
[59:10.700 --> 59:13.980]  emit no fumes or gases and produce electricity from the sun
[59:13.980 --> 59:18.300]  whether it's dangerous summer storms blackouts intensifying civil unrest
[59:18.300 --> 59:21.260]  you're not going to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep
[59:21.260 --> 59:24.860]  and here's the best news if you want to get one this week solutions from science
[59:24.860 --> 59:28.460]  has a big sale on their fast charge solar generators
[59:28.460 --> 59:31.980]  and they're giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off the grid
[59:31.980 --> 59:35.180]  gear in addition to the low price for infill wars listeners
[59:35.180 --> 59:38.620]  so it's a good time to check it out go to gridwars.com
[59:38.620 --> 59:42.060]  that's gridwars.com it's a great opportunity to generate
[59:42.060 --> 59:45.740]  maximum electricity with minimum money go to gridwars.com
[59:45.740 --> 59:51.580]  that's gridwars.com
[59:52.300 --> 59:59.580]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:00:07.100 --> 01:00:12.780]  another world another time
[01:00:12.780 --> 01:00:21.100]  in the age of one another world another time
[01:00:21.100 --> 01:00:24.300]  all right we got pastor manning popping in later i want to open the phones up as
[01:00:24.300 --> 01:00:28.300]  well do five more minutes with roger stone
[01:00:28.300 --> 01:00:35.180]  the energy in this country from austin texas is so
[01:00:35.180 --> 01:00:38.940]  over the top i don't even know what to say anymore i mean it is just
[01:00:38.940 --> 01:00:45.340]  an amazing time to be alive the evil the corruption
[01:00:45.340 --> 01:00:50.060]  is so out in the open now that it makes my head spin
[01:00:50.060 --> 01:00:54.140]  and there's got to be a breaking point when we've got google and and all the
[01:00:54.140 --> 01:00:56.940]  other computer companies and tech companies
[01:00:56.940 --> 01:01:00.140]  admitting there for hillary and cnn admitting it
[01:01:00.140 --> 01:01:03.900]  and all the rest of craziness and hillary obviously so ill
[01:01:03.900 --> 01:01:09.980]  and then msnbc saying oh trump isn't sleeping up he's crazy
[01:01:09.980 --> 01:01:13.980]  he's unfit this is an incredible time roger stone
[01:01:13.980 --> 01:01:17.340]  in your gut what do you think's going to end up happening with this election
[01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:23.340]  i see a narrow down trump win i see trump triumphing in these debates because
[01:01:23.340 --> 01:01:28.620]  the only thing predictable about down from is these entirely unpredictable so
[01:01:28.620 --> 01:01:32.620]  hillary will never know where he's going to come could it be
[01:01:32.620 --> 01:01:36.380]  bill's history as a sexual predator and hillary's history of
[01:01:36.380 --> 01:01:39.900]  bullying and intimidating his victims could it be
[01:01:39.900 --> 01:01:45.260]  bangazi and the arming of isis and issues pertaining to her tenure as
[01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:49.980]  secretary of state could it be the epic corruption of the
[01:01:49.980 --> 01:01:56.140]  clinton foundation could it be the 1994 crime bill which
[01:01:56.140 --> 01:02:02.380]  incarcerated an entire generation of young black men for non-violent crimes
[01:02:02.380 --> 01:02:07.020]  including possession of small amounts of drugs a law that hillary said was
[01:02:07.020 --> 01:02:11.740]  necessary because black people were super predators and had to be brought
[01:02:11.740 --> 01:02:15.900]  to heal it could be any of those things or anything else so
[01:02:15.900 --> 01:02:20.780]  i think that the uh that the debates are an opportunity for trump i think he
[01:02:20.780 --> 01:02:25.900]  will exploit that opportunity uh and therefore and when you add to that
[01:02:25.900 --> 01:02:31.180]  what i think will be the bombshell revelations dropped by wiki leaks i think
[01:02:31.180 --> 01:02:34.780]  by election day hillary is thoroughly right
[01:02:34.780 --> 01:02:38.860]  do you know or are you at liberty to give us any other hints i mean isan just
[01:02:38.860 --> 01:02:43.660]  said some of it is hillary sending weapons to isis the total proof i mean
[01:02:43.660 --> 01:02:47.500]  we know that happened but it'd be great to have that any other hints
[01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:51.100]  uh nothing that i'm able to talk about i'm not going to upstage
[01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:54.060]  one of the great freedom fighters in the world today
[01:02:54.060 --> 01:02:58.700]  julian isan but but you've a little bird told serious have a feeling
[01:02:58.700 --> 01:03:03.020]  that we might see this dribbled out of the debates we have mutual friends uh
[01:03:03.020 --> 01:03:07.500]  and often i was very careful in my words i never said i met with him
[01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:10.940]  never said i spoke with him we have communicated through a
[01:03:10.940 --> 01:03:16.300]  trusted mutual friend uh and he is committed to this course nobody is
[01:03:16.300 --> 01:03:21.500]  changing his documents his documents as always will be july and i think that
[01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:26.220]  he's got information on the entire us establishment
[01:03:26.220 --> 01:03:30.300]  how like you said no no saudi connections no
[01:03:30.300 --> 01:03:35.180]  russia connections for trump he's clean uh he has uh he's certainly sold
[01:03:35.180 --> 01:03:40.060]  apartments to some wealthy saudi's uh he has uh no really he's never met uh
[01:03:40.060 --> 01:03:44.540]  vladmir who unlike hillary who took huge amounts of cash
[01:03:44.540 --> 01:03:48.540]  sure exactly everything she's going to trump for she's actually doing so this
[01:03:48.540 --> 01:03:52.540]  is just an incredible time uh asan's though he talks about hillary just
[01:03:52.540 --> 01:03:55.420]  shakes his head with the info he's got i mean
[01:03:55.420 --> 01:03:58.220]  imagine what it must be like to just actually see what these people are
[01:03:58.220 --> 01:04:01.420]  involved in well and to make it absolutely clear
[01:04:01.420 --> 01:04:05.180]  and i wrote this for quite a part we now know for a certainty
[01:04:05.180 --> 01:04:10.940]  that the dnc heist documents were not linked by the russians had nothing to
[01:04:10.940 --> 01:04:15.260]  do with the russians were hacked and first made public by crucifer
[01:04:15.260 --> 01:04:19.420]  too uh almost a month ago and when that didn't get the
[01:04:19.420 --> 01:04:22.140]  appropriate traction he took from the wiki leaks
[01:04:22.140 --> 01:04:25.740]  we didn't leave them so the whole idea that this is book
[01:04:25.740 --> 01:04:29.340]  this is what the russians that that uh
[01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:32.860]  down from fall manifold or somehow in bed with book
[01:04:32.860 --> 01:04:36.860]  is nonsense by the way book doesn't particularly like fall manifold because
[01:04:36.860 --> 01:04:40.780]  manifold helped convince the ukrain president you uh
[01:04:40.780 --> 01:04:45.500]  again kovic to join the european union no i know it's all total bull
[01:04:45.500 --> 01:04:48.860]  all right uh roger stone will talk to you again soon have a great weekend stone

[01:05:07.740 --> 01:05:11.100]  more leaked emails from hillary clinton's time as secretary of state
[01:05:11.100 --> 01:05:15.660]  proved that she was taking foreign policy advice from left-wing billionaire
[01:05:15.660 --> 01:05:20.460]  activist george soros the same guy who was bringing civil unrest
[01:05:20.460 --> 01:05:24.460]  around the world an email provided by wiki leaks showed soros
[01:05:24.460 --> 01:05:29.260]  reaching out to secretary clinton over a foreign policy dispute in albania
[01:05:29.260 --> 01:05:33.180]  dear hillary a serious situation has arisen in albania which needs urgent
[01:05:33.180 --> 01:05:36.700]  attention at senior levels of the u.s government there are serious concerns
[01:05:36.700 --> 01:05:40.380]  about further unrest connected to a counter demonstration source
[01:05:40.380 --> 01:05:44.140]  urges the then secretary of state to get the international community involved
[01:05:44.140 --> 01:05:47.020]  in pressure the prime minister to forestall further
[01:05:47.020 --> 01:05:50.620]  demonstrations and tone down public pronouncements as well
[01:05:50.620 --> 01:05:54.700]  appointing a senior european official to act as the mediator

[01:08:44.540 --> 01:08:49.180]  the latest development where top clinton state department aid helped clinton
[01:08:49.180 --> 01:08:52.060]  foundation uh while they were working for the state
[01:08:52.060 --> 01:08:55.020]  department and and and money being sent from
[01:08:55.020 --> 01:08:59.340]  african dictators to the foundation and then they're given favorable deals
[01:08:59.340 --> 01:09:02.860]  this is something we've all known but now
[01:09:02.860 --> 01:09:09.660]  it's all coming out totally illegal meanwhile last hour we played the 45
[01:09:09.660 --> 01:09:13.900]  times secretary clinton pushed the tpp the secret global
[01:09:13.900 --> 01:09:17.340]  government deal masquerading as a trade deal but now she
[01:09:17.340 --> 01:09:21.420]  says she never supported it and will always fight it into the future
[01:09:21.420 --> 01:09:26.140]  isn't that just special meanwhile i've got this stack of news and again we're

[01:09:32.620 --> 01:09:36.620]  let refugees into your homes france pleads with citizens to help ease
[01:09:36.620 --> 01:09:40.780]  migrant crisis bring the jihadis directly
[01:09:40.780 --> 01:09:45.020]  into your homes the french government now now germany's already started this
[01:09:45.020 --> 01:09:47.820]  where you live in section eight housing they say you got to bring them in or
[01:09:47.820 --> 01:09:50.540]  you won't get your quote free housing this is for retirees they're taking
[01:09:50.540 --> 01:09:53.580]  retirees homes basically the french government is struggling to
[01:09:53.580 --> 01:09:57.500]  tackle a migrant crisis that they advertise and told folks to come
[01:09:57.500 --> 01:10:01.660]  there are currently 147 reception centers oh reception centers across
[01:10:01.660 --> 01:10:04.620]  france but these are in massive demand as desperate
[01:10:04.620 --> 01:10:09.900]  refugees continue to flee the middle east so the answer is cater more
[01:10:09.900 --> 01:10:12.780]  that's why they brought down syria opened it up as a gateway from the middle
[01:10:12.780 --> 01:10:18.700]  east into turkey the famous muslim invasion route
[01:10:18.700 --> 01:10:22.700]  housing minister has pledged to build another 50 centers before the end of
[01:10:22.700 --> 01:10:25.660]  the next month good but she also called on french
[01:10:25.660 --> 01:10:28.540]  people to cope open up their homes to migrants who needed
[01:10:28.540 --> 01:10:32.220]  several organizations have already promised to help the pope says you
[01:10:32.220 --> 01:10:34.300]  should too but the Vatican isn't taking one person
[01:10:34.300 --> 01:10:40.460]  and that's 200 foot walls two wealthy syria muslims kept slaves in their
[01:10:40.460 --> 01:10:44.540]  texas home this is from the u.s. chronicle
[01:10:44.540 --> 01:10:48.780]  they told a judge that mohammed had slaves and punished them
[01:10:48.780 --> 01:10:54.540]  was islamophobic that's right um the texas couple have been found guilty
[01:10:54.540 --> 01:10:59.340]  of engaging in forced labor hassan al-hamud 46 and his wife
[01:10:59.340 --> 01:11:04.620]  zanidab al-hosani 39 pled guilty the crimes of holding a person
[01:11:04.620 --> 01:11:08.620]  against their will enforced labor otherwise known as slavery but it's
[01:11:08.620 --> 01:11:11.820]  not when muslims do it they tried to convince the judge
[01:11:11.820 --> 01:11:15.100]  that their actions were acceptable because their prophet
[01:11:15.100 --> 01:11:18.780]  mohammed the creator of the religion of islam kept slaves his own
[01:11:18.780 --> 01:11:22.780]  therefore any punishment that they received would be islamophobic
[01:11:22.780 --> 01:11:26.060]  hoping indians are allowed to take mescaline that's their religion
[01:11:26.060 --> 01:11:29.100]  you are allowed to grab slaves and keep them
[01:11:29.100 --> 01:11:32.700]  nothing in the room i'm sure the hovering post will probably have an article
[01:11:32.700 --> 01:11:36.060]  about how we need to
[01:11:36.060 --> 01:11:40.540]  be more cuckled and wear burkas by the way i didn't get to it yesterday it was
[01:11:40.540 --> 01:11:44.380]  an article about how salons giving up on being
[01:11:44.380 --> 01:11:48.380]  a pedophile promotion bureau and supposedly some trump
[01:11:48.380 --> 01:11:54.700]  slash quasi-supporter guy is taking salon over as soon as it's failed
[01:11:54.700 --> 01:11:59.660]  and you've done your kamikaze mission of lying and disinformation all the rest
[01:11:59.660 --> 01:12:02.860]  of it so now you're gonna try to flip back the new salon very different from the
[01:12:02.860 --> 01:12:06.940]  old salon new ceo adds conservative voices plans
[01:12:06.940 --> 01:12:10.940]  relocations away from political coverage
[01:12:10.940 --> 01:12:14.700]  well just please don't have articles with guys salivating over
[01:12:14.700 --> 01:12:19.340]  four-year-old girls and videos i mean you know come on
[01:12:19.900 --> 01:12:24.220]  conservative leaders call on media to report on genocide of christians
[01:12:24.220 --> 01:12:27.420]  cns news the un had mentioned it's doubled the last 10 years there is
[01:12:27.420 --> 01:12:31.180]  persecution of christians at all time highs
[01:12:31.180 --> 01:12:35.020]  german intelligence we have evidence isis hides hit squads among syrian
[01:12:35.020 --> 01:12:37.500]  refugees uh gee you have evidence that they told
[01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:40.140]  you two years ago that in the next migrant when they were sending in their
[01:12:40.140 --> 01:12:42.620]  jotties
[01:12:43.260 --> 01:12:46.540]  so thank you for telling us that
[01:12:46.780 --> 01:12:50.140]  twitter secretly censored negative obama comments in 2015
[01:12:50.140 --> 01:12:53.820]  oh my gosh yes that's on info wars dot com and it's all coming out they're very
[01:12:53.820 --> 01:12:57.420]  very proud of it
[01:12:57.420 --> 01:13:03.100]  meanwhile you talk about real police data makes this later dea regularly
[01:13:03.100 --> 01:13:07.260]  minds americans travel records to seize millions in cash
[01:13:07.260 --> 01:13:12.060]  they'll even grab a couple thousand dollars i mean when i take the whole
[01:13:12.060 --> 01:13:16.060]  family out of the country in case credit cards got turned off
[01:13:16.060 --> 01:13:20.460]  in case the globalist pulls up and who knows i mean
[01:13:21.420 --> 01:13:24.060]  every adult member of the family takes three or four thousand dollars that's
[01:13:24.060 --> 01:13:26.940]  what you need and they'll boy coming back in they're like what do you got
[01:13:26.940 --> 01:13:29.420]  two thousand dollars for and i'm like well i mean
[01:13:29.420 --> 01:13:33.740]  cash i mean they want everybody digitally controlled and the dea illegally
[01:13:33.740 --> 01:13:37.420]  does this parallel construction where they have all the nsa data so does the
[01:13:37.420 --> 01:13:41.500]  irs it's just so criminal and the big mega banks control the drug
[01:13:41.500 --> 01:13:45.420]  trade and the government knows it so at the end of the movie sarcaria with
[01:13:45.420 --> 01:13:50.460]  josh brolin they admit that the cia has trimmed back 10 cartels down to
[01:13:50.460 --> 01:13:53.020]  three to make it more manageable and controls the drug
[01:13:53.020 --> 01:13:57.420]  trade they just put it in hollywood films now
[01:13:57.420 --> 01:14:00.140]  such a joke
[01:14:00.700 --> 01:14:04.220]  we want the cash dea sees millions from travelers
[01:14:04.220 --> 01:14:09.180]  bribes transit employees oh yeah yeah the big secret is when you got a plumber
[01:14:09.180 --> 01:14:12.540]  in your house or an air conditioning person or whatever
[01:14:12.540 --> 01:14:16.060]  a lot of them make more money every year as informants
[01:14:16.060 --> 01:14:20.140]  of money they get from seizures and convictions and they get off the plumbing
[01:14:20.140 --> 01:14:23.500]  job so they're just looking in your house there's been cases of them
[01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:27.420]  planting things too uh what a society we've created
[01:14:27.420 --> 01:14:30.540]  and again people say well then why aren't you one these poor black lives
[01:14:30.540 --> 01:14:33.980]  matter let's shoot some police just because we have a corrupt government
[01:14:33.980 --> 01:14:36.460]  and it has corrupt practices that are getting out of control
[01:14:36.460 --> 01:14:40.300]  doesn't mean we start a civil war because george soros once won
[01:14:40.300 --> 01:14:44.380]  and it doesn't mean the average cop's involved in this this is the feds
[01:14:44.380 --> 01:14:47.660]  and even the average dea person doesn't like it and wants it reformed that's
[01:14:47.660 --> 01:14:50.940]  why we know about a lot of it
[01:14:50.940 --> 01:14:54.460]  and just if we i don't want drug legalization by the way
[01:14:54.460 --> 01:14:57.580]  i want decriminalization i want to make it uncool
[01:14:57.580 --> 01:15:01.340]  like they've done in areas of europe and it's caused drug use to plummet
[01:15:01.340 --> 01:15:05.260]  i want to make it you're a loser not some cool guy and take the money out of it
[01:15:05.260 --> 01:15:08.300]  because certainly there's a horrible criminal culture involved in drugs i
[01:15:08.300 --> 01:15:11.580]  don't like it but the whole thing was created at
[01:15:11.580 --> 01:15:15.820]  the end of prohibition because they didn't have a market anymore
[01:15:15.820 --> 01:15:19.660]  alcohol had been made legal the very same globalist interest began to make
[01:15:19.660 --> 01:15:23.980]  drugs illegal so they had something new to corrupt the police and control society
[01:15:23.980 --> 01:15:27.260]  rand paul says hillary should get five years in prison for lying to congress
[01:15:27.260 --> 01:15:30.700]  about weapons going to ices it's now come out that she was ordering weapons to
[01:15:30.700 --> 01:15:34.380]  him and that donald trump is right come on link up with
[01:15:34.380 --> 01:15:37.980]  donald trump rand i know you guys played golf and were friends
[01:15:37.980 --> 01:15:42.300]  and i mean please in fact speaking of that here is uh
[01:15:42.300 --> 01:15:47.500]  here is rand paul on fox news last night let's take a listen to um
[01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:51.740]  what you asked her back in 2013 been gazi hearing
[01:15:51.740 --> 01:15:55.500]  it's been in news reports that ships have been leaving from libya
[01:15:55.500 --> 01:15:59.260]  and that they may have weapons and what i'd like to know is the annex that was
[01:15:59.260 --> 01:16:02.700]  close by were they involved with procuring buying
[01:16:02.700 --> 01:16:06.540]  selling obtaining weapons and were any of these weapons being transferred to
[01:16:06.540 --> 01:16:09.820]  other countries any countries turkey included well
[01:16:09.820 --> 01:16:14.380]  senator you'll have to direct direct that question to uh the agency that
[01:16:14.380 --> 01:16:18.940]  ran the annex and i will i will see what information is available and
[01:16:18.940 --> 01:16:22.860]  um you're saying you don't know i do not know i don't have any information on
[01:16:22.860 --> 01:16:26.140]  that now if wiki leaks in fact does have emails
[01:16:26.140 --> 01:16:30.300]  proving that she did know what does that mean to you
[01:16:30.300 --> 01:16:33.900]  it's a felony to lie to congress you can get five years in prison
[01:16:33.900 --> 01:16:37.420]  and we can't continue to say that the clintons are above the law
[01:16:37.420 --> 01:16:40.620]  i do believe that the cia annex in ben gazi
[01:16:40.620 --> 01:16:45.100]  was procuring weapons some of them to get them away from the jihadist in libya
[01:16:45.100 --> 01:16:48.300]  but some of it to ferry those weapons through turkey
[01:16:48.300 --> 01:16:51.980]  into syria there have been many many firsthand accounts
[01:16:51.980 --> 01:16:56.620]  new york times london times washington times have all reported upon this
[01:16:56.620 --> 01:16:59.820]  i know for a fact that the current secretary of state
[01:16:59.820 --> 01:17:03.660]  is very aware of what the cia is doing and i can't reveal what i've heard from
[01:17:03.660 --> 01:17:07.340]  him but i can tell you that he's aware of what the cia is doing in syria
[01:17:07.340 --> 01:17:10.300]  and i find it hard to believe that harry clinton
[01:17:10.300 --> 01:17:14.940]  who all the news reports have said she was the biggest advocate for arming
[01:17:14.940 --> 01:17:19.420]  the islamic rebels in syria many of whom turned out to be not only enemies of
[01:17:19.420 --> 01:17:22.380]  ours some of them may have turned out to be isis
[01:17:22.380 --> 01:17:27.260]  but some of them also turned out to be enemies of israel as well
[01:17:27.260 --> 01:17:31.660]  may have been i mean the pentagon said like 95 percent were quote lohabius
[01:17:31.660 --> 01:17:34.620]  that's al qaeda that's isis whatever name you give
[01:17:34.620 --> 01:17:38.540]  it's lohabius the black flag with the white circle on it with the
[01:17:38.540 --> 01:17:44.700]  there is only one god and his prophet is muhammad
[01:17:44.700 --> 01:17:49.180]  uh again donald trump is just saying what's admitted fact and the whore
[01:17:49.180 --> 01:17:53.100]  media acts like it's the end of the world and notice trump is bringing
[01:17:53.100 --> 01:17:57.260]  all this back out the attack on our guns the attack on our sovereignty
[01:17:57.260 --> 01:18:02.300]  the one-sided trade deals arming the radical al qaeda folks
[01:18:02.300 --> 01:18:08.540]  bringing them into our countries where is the fault with this man

[01:24:14.860 --> 01:24:21.100]  paragraph is going to say because i know this enemy so well
[01:24:21.100 --> 01:24:25.260]  but during the break i'm out there we've got fox seeing in on these monitors to
[01:24:25.260 --> 01:24:30.380]  monitor establishment media and wolf blitzer
[01:24:30.380 --> 01:24:34.540]  who is a foreign agent of israel on record
[01:24:34.540 --> 01:24:37.820]  i'm not against israel it's just like anderson cooper cia
[01:24:37.820 --> 01:24:41.340]  it tell folks you're cia
[01:24:41.580 --> 01:24:47.740]  well blitzer is a liberal leftist israeli operative
[01:24:47.740 --> 01:24:52.860]  probably massad did not want to give maybe five thousand to ten thousand
[01:24:52.860 --> 01:24:57.260]  remaining us troops legal immunity from iraqi prosecution you know but that's
[01:24:57.260 --> 01:25:00.140]  a matter of leadership barack obama should have been able to
[01:25:00.140 --> 01:25:04.220]  what is he doing so let's get into it i'm out there during that break and i'm
[01:25:04.220 --> 01:25:08.060]  one i turned it up and i'm watching it
[01:25:08.060 --> 01:25:11.340]  and i knew what they were going to say before they said it they show a clip of
[01:25:11.340 --> 01:25:17.660]  donald trump in 2007 saying get out of iraq i said don't go in in 2003
[01:25:17.660 --> 01:25:20.620]  and they flipped around and go he's a private citizen
[01:25:20.620 --> 01:25:25.980]  and he screwed up we should have stayed but obama screwed up worse so they're
[01:25:25.980 --> 01:25:32.060]  so they're saying obama's bad and so is trump because obama did the pull out
[01:25:32.060 --> 01:25:37.660]  in 2010 2011 which he never did and then i knew it was coming next out of their
[01:25:37.660 --> 01:25:43.100]  fat mouths that's what gave isis the ability to organize
[01:25:43.100 --> 01:25:47.500]  and take over and get a third of iraq and then invade syria
[01:25:47.500 --> 01:25:52.700]  i mean i know what they're going to say before they say it it's so
[01:25:52.700 --> 01:25:58.540]  ridiculous he pulled out of iraq to create the
[01:25:58.540 --> 01:26:02.140]  vacuum on purpose and they gave him the weapons
[01:26:02.140 --> 01:26:05.980]  and they said in their communication and when signs in english
[01:26:05.980 --> 01:26:13.020]  libya now syria's next and it was an organized plan so it doesn't
[01:26:13.020 --> 01:26:17.500]  legitimize that we ever went to iraq
[01:26:17.500 --> 01:26:21.180]  because then obama pulled out and all went to hell
[01:26:21.180 --> 01:26:24.780]  they took iraq out as part of the admitted plan that wesley clark has
[01:26:24.780 --> 01:26:28.620]  talked about and others have this is an admitted pentagon plan
[01:26:28.620 --> 01:26:32.780]  it's bipartisan going back 20 years now listen to me carefully here i ought to
[01:26:32.780 --> 01:26:36.620]  get a mobile mic and go over there to the map on the wall and show folks
[01:26:36.620 --> 01:26:40.460]  you have to take out the secular country iraq
[01:26:40.460 --> 01:26:43.820]  if you're going to then bring down syria its ally next door
[01:26:43.820 --> 01:26:48.540]  and who are you going to import suny wahhabis to repopulate and take over the
[01:26:48.540 --> 01:26:52.540]  area that have vastly larger population numbers
[01:26:52.540 --> 01:26:56.300]  so they gave them the old bases the convoys the weapons
[01:26:56.300 --> 01:26:59.900]  the advisors everything they go into libya
[01:26:59.900 --> 01:27:03.740]  then they go into iraq then they go into syria then they go into turkey who
[01:27:03.740 --> 01:27:08.300]  gives them free passage in and gives them air support and artillery support
[01:27:08.300 --> 01:27:13.420]  to then go into europe for the next phase and our governments advertise to
[01:27:13.420 --> 01:27:17.260]  bring them in 80 military age men almost all up with fake passports
[01:27:17.260 --> 01:27:21.420]  they're not syrian refugees they are the jihadi invasion force
[01:27:21.420 --> 01:27:25.260]  from everywhere the caucuses uh from the stands
[01:27:25.260 --> 01:27:29.340]  from north africa from central africa from western africa

[01:34:30.060 --> 01:34:35.020]  the persecution of the press ever seen
[01:34:35.020 --> 01:34:40.700]  ever seen and of whistleblowers and hillary says i came
[01:34:40.700 --> 01:34:44.860]  we saw he died and and all her always bragging about and obama he's really
[01:34:44.860 --> 01:34:48.220]  good at killing people he said
[01:34:49.580 --> 01:34:52.780]  and now you've got these deaths of lawyers filing lawsuits that are burning
[01:34:52.780 --> 01:34:57.100]  supporters and dnc people and other folks getting killed i mean this is
[01:34:57.100 --> 01:35:03.180]  crazy and you've got these fake polls where they had 15 percent more democrat
[01:35:03.180 --> 01:35:06.540]  in than republican i mean this is amazing i want to ask pastor
[01:35:06.540 --> 01:35:09.340]  manning's only with us for 30 minutes today i appreciate his time we'll go to
[01:35:09.340 --> 01:35:13.260]  your phone calls in the third hour today in about 30 minutes from now
[01:35:13.260 --> 01:35:16.460]  pastor james david manning a middle of harlem helped bring down to a great
[01:35:16.460 --> 01:35:21.100]  extent uh that corrupt thug al sharpton otla dot
[01:35:21.100 --> 01:35:24.860]  org has a lot of courage always has really interesting angles a lot of
[01:35:24.860 --> 01:35:29.020]  wisdom always helps you know me clarify things i mean
[01:35:29.020 --> 01:35:33.340]  that's why quite frankly i have what we have in mind
[01:35:33.340 --> 01:35:36.460]  what do you think's really going on what do you think the real numbers are i
[01:35:36.460 --> 01:35:39.180]  think it's a landslide for trump but they're gonna try to steal it
[01:35:39.180 --> 01:35:43.980]  what do you make of such a wall of media deception i've never seen anything like
[01:35:43.980 --> 01:35:47.980]  it what is the real state of the world because i got to tell you pastor manning
[01:35:47.980 --> 01:35:52.060]  i've gone from having a lot of concern and feeling the ominous energy
[01:35:52.060 --> 01:35:58.940]  build up the last few years to now it's a sickening level where i feel like
[01:35:58.940 --> 01:36:02.700]  i'm fighting for my life or something i mean i i'm i'm i'm waking up in the
[01:36:02.700 --> 01:36:05.660]  middle of the night wanting to work i'm working seven days a week i'm breaking
[01:36:05.660 --> 01:36:10.940]  out sweat it's cold in the studio i am i mean i i i'm not a hysterical person i
[01:36:10.940 --> 01:36:15.900]  get angry i get motivated but i'm telling you i can just feel evil rising
[01:36:15.900 --> 01:36:18.540]  there's also a lot of good happening but i tell you what are you feeling in your
[01:36:18.540 --> 01:36:21.820]  spirit well you know we're suspected of the evil
[01:36:21.820 --> 01:36:26.940]  rising you're absolutely right uh but i think to fully interpret this uh we
[01:36:26.940 --> 01:36:33.260]  need to go back partially to 2008 where the globalist and new world order
[01:36:33.260 --> 01:36:38.060]  people discovered all of a sudden that they wanted barack hussein obama
[01:36:38.060 --> 01:36:43.740]  president i know several reasons why he was a better choice than than hillary
[01:36:43.740 --> 01:36:46.700]  or john mccain at the time because he could have gone with
[01:36:46.700 --> 01:36:52.940]  uh with with either one but they decided that they wanted obama and they went
[01:36:52.940 --> 01:36:57.500]  ahead now and put the you know they they queued into the computer
[01:36:57.500 --> 01:37:01.900]  system of rigging elections rigging the media paying the media
[01:37:01.900 --> 01:37:08.380]  and to some degree the assassinations etc uh to get obama in i mean because he
[01:37:08.380 --> 01:37:12.460]  was not and then they began to yeast up all these crowds
[01:37:12.460 --> 01:37:19.260]  in dusseldorf germany obama commanded a crowd of 200 000 people
[01:37:19.260 --> 01:37:23.820]  alex you know this isn't even america but in germany
[01:37:23.820 --> 01:37:27.740]  because the european new world order people there wanted him and he wanted
[01:37:27.740 --> 01:37:31.980]  to say that that europe wanted him so what i think we think we see
[01:37:31.980 --> 01:37:35.980]  happening now is the same structure now being
[01:37:35.980 --> 01:37:39.900]  used double time and hillary is saying listen
[01:37:39.900 --> 01:37:44.300]  i sat back i sucked it up i didn't squeal i didn't
[01:37:44.300 --> 01:37:48.780]  i didn't try to bring down obama i didn't try to reveal who all of y'all are
[01:37:48.780 --> 01:37:51.340]  though you paid me well at goldman sacks and
[01:37:51.340 --> 01:37:55.340]  allowed me to earn a lot of money there but i want this election
[01:37:55.340 --> 01:37:59.340]  i want it i don't care who wants don trump and i want this election
[01:37:59.340 --> 01:38:02.940]  make it happen and that's what we see happening and we got the emails to all
[01:38:02.940 --> 01:38:06.860]  the media telling them what to do incredible scandal
[01:38:06.860 --> 01:38:10.220]  well i mean that's that's a part of the process is just one of the more
[01:38:10.220 --> 01:38:13.580]  components of the way the media handles all of the
[01:38:13.580 --> 01:38:16.380]  information you know julie and asson just push out
[01:38:16.380 --> 01:38:19.660]  information or russia's pushing out information that
[01:38:19.660 --> 01:38:23.340]  they you get pushed back from the dung head media
[01:38:23.340 --> 01:38:27.340]  on these items and the american people are sitting there asking who they're
[01:38:27.340 --> 01:38:32.060]  going to believe they're lying eyes or the media
[01:38:32.540 --> 01:38:35.260]  so that's what's happening do you think they've miscalculated or do you think
[01:38:35.260 --> 01:38:39.500]  they're going to pull this off well it's kind of you know it depends
[01:38:39.500 --> 01:38:43.100]  they could change horses in the middle of the stream they have no scruples these
[01:38:43.100 --> 01:38:47.660]  are people without a conscience well frankly i mean they may
[01:38:47.660 --> 01:38:51.420]  they don't have a heart so they could change it right now they've gone ahead
[01:38:51.420 --> 01:38:56.860]  and said listen hillary it's yours uh you've got it you're 15 points ahead in
[01:38:56.860 --> 01:39:00.620]  colorado for crying out loud your four points ahead in
[01:39:00.620 --> 01:39:04.140]  and george and nine points ahead in north carolina
[01:39:04.140 --> 01:39:09.020]  who believes any of that oh well you know this is i mean people hate obama
[01:39:09.020 --> 01:39:12.460]  they hate hillary and she can't even get crowds of 200 people
[01:39:12.460 --> 01:39:16.060]  alex people in here when a trump supporter
[01:39:16.060 --> 01:39:19.740]  hear that hillary is winning by nine points in north carolina
[01:39:19.740 --> 01:39:22.940]  you know listen alex you you would be going to give up hope that's why they're
[01:39:22.940 --> 01:39:26.220]  right absolutely that's exactly what i want to say
[01:39:26.220 --> 01:39:29.340]  it just defeats them they feel defeated i'm not going to the polls i'm not going
[01:39:29.340 --> 01:39:32.540]  in more rallies i'm going home and get drunk i'm going to golden carral or
[01:39:32.540 --> 01:39:37.260]  something or going to walmart and buy myself another rifle that's what they
[01:39:37.260 --> 01:39:40.220]  want and people need to stop doing that like buying a 20th rifle and i'm not
[01:39:40.220 --> 01:39:43.260]  going to buy guns but i'm saying just like oh this will make it okay i still
[01:39:43.260 --> 01:39:46.380]  have this you need to politically bust your butt because i'm telling you i don't
[01:39:46.380 --> 01:39:49.180]  get up here in life folks we've shown all the reports we've done it
[01:39:49.180 --> 01:39:52.380]  every major polling agency is working with the democrats now
[01:39:52.380 --> 01:39:55.500]  with these public polls they do internal polls so the campaign knows what's
[01:39:55.500 --> 01:39:59.980]  happening trump was 15 points ahead uh according to insider polls
[01:39:59.980 --> 01:40:03.260]  that were serious polls after the convention that's why they started
[01:40:03.260 --> 01:40:06.780]  sampling 15 points more in these other polls try to put hillary
[01:40:06.780 --> 01:40:10.060]  ahead it's totally fake and i'm not just saying that but what mannings that is
[01:40:10.060 --> 01:40:12.620]  true it then creates a self-fulfilling
[01:40:12.620 --> 01:40:16.300]  prophecy where people then actually believe that's happening and a lot of
[01:40:16.300 --> 01:40:19.980]  folks are on the fence and go well i just want to bet on a winner and feel like
[01:40:19.980 --> 01:40:23.660]  you know i'm with a winner so okay i'm for hillary now
[01:40:23.660 --> 01:40:27.340]  yeah and the other thing alex i think going back to the purchasing of more
[01:40:27.340 --> 01:40:31.660]  rifles also you got 10 you're going out by the level no hit listen i'm all for
[01:40:31.660 --> 01:40:35.420]  the the uh second amendment purchase as many weapons as you need to protect
[01:40:35.420 --> 01:40:38.220]  yourself your family your country your country but here
[01:40:38.220 --> 01:40:41.980]  we need to begin to look at the fact that how do we protect ourselves against
[01:40:41.980 --> 01:40:47.020]  lithium chemtrails and fluoride and the autism shots that are given out to
[01:40:47.020 --> 01:40:49.820]  exactly we're getting by they're not they're not going to hit a straight up
[01:40:49.820 --> 01:40:54.060]  military up front that's for marketing up and look look i know because
[01:40:54.060 --> 01:40:57.500]  when bad people get elected and bad things happen i psychoanalyzed myself
[01:40:57.500 --> 01:41:01.420]  years ago going to the shop buying more guns and ammo
[01:41:01.420 --> 01:41:05.900]  literally as like a comfort blanket and and and so i'm not putting people down i
[01:41:05.900 --> 01:41:09.100]  know i do it oh i'm not either god knows i'm not doing that but i'm what i'm
[01:41:09.100 --> 01:41:11.660]  trying to say no i agree with you i agree with you
[01:41:11.660 --> 01:41:15.340]  we we need to start thinking about a better defense mechanism
[01:41:15.340 --> 01:41:18.860]  because if they want to remove an entire community they let's say for instance
[01:41:18.860 --> 01:41:21.980]  they wanted a part of georgia the bordering tennessee
[01:41:21.980 --> 01:41:26.620]  that they wanted to just annihilate they could do that and one fell swoop i don't
[01:41:26.620 --> 01:41:31.020]  care how many weapons you got there you can't shoot lithium out of the air
[01:41:31.020 --> 01:41:35.820]  but purchase your weapons please do so but we're under attack by more ways than
[01:41:35.820 --> 01:41:39.020]  just guns yeah absolutely talk about spiritual
[01:41:39.020 --> 01:41:42.300]  attack more and more i realize we just got to go to god hit our knees in fact
[01:41:42.300 --> 01:41:45.100]  i'm putting you on the spot you'd expect to do this pastor but i really respect
[01:41:45.100 --> 01:41:48.140]  you and watch your tv show and and also catch some of your sermons that are
[01:41:48.140 --> 01:41:51.180]  powerful uh they're in harlem broadcast around the world
[01:41:51.180 --> 01:41:54.620]  will you lead us in prayer to maybe heal this nation or
[01:41:54.620 --> 01:41:59.740]  protect donald trump or to have the uh the collectively the people be knocked
[01:41:59.740 --> 01:42:03.580]  off their horses uh like like sol of tarsus on his road to
[01:42:03.580 --> 01:42:06.220]  demascus because i mean really i think it's we have to
[01:42:06.220 --> 01:42:08.940]  ask god don't we i mean is it that i don't know
[01:42:08.940 --> 01:42:13.420]  absolutely if you desire i pray i certainly will pray please do you want me
[01:42:13.420 --> 01:42:17.340]  let's go to the lord company father lord jesus we love you we thank you
[01:42:17.340 --> 01:42:24.380]  and we realize almighty god we cannot win this election take back america we
[01:42:24.380 --> 01:42:28.940]  cannot be free without you uh there was a time
[01:42:28.940 --> 01:42:33.820]  and the sentiments and the odor of when we could go to the election pull the
[01:42:33.820 --> 01:42:36.780]  lever for a particular candidate and it worked
[01:42:36.780 --> 01:42:41.340]  our vote was respected but jesus we're fighting a much more
[01:42:41.340 --> 01:42:47.500]  deeper spiritual battle with fighting enemies that have powers over the airways
[01:42:47.500 --> 01:42:52.140]  we're fighting an enemy who have power over the very foods that we eat
[01:42:52.140 --> 01:42:58.060]  we need a word from heaven we need your word almighty god to be able to sustain

[01:43:27.740 --> 01:43:32.140]  of the new world order who are destroying it by bringing in minorities and
[01:43:32.140 --> 01:43:37.580]  pushing out original founders and people who worked hard to make the trains
[01:43:37.580 --> 01:43:43.020]  run on time in this nation to ravage it and to carve it up into various sections
[01:43:43.020 --> 01:43:48.460]  and pit people against one another we need you almighty god to work against the
[01:43:48.460 --> 01:43:52.700]  forces of obama and all the people that he has under his
[01:43:52.700 --> 01:43:57.180]  foot and all the people that are in the grave as a result of him
[01:43:57.180 --> 01:44:02.060]  and of the Clintons a a large number of things can be said about politicians
[01:44:02.060 --> 01:44:05.980]  and they all have their shortcomings i'm not sure i never want to be one but
[01:44:05.980 --> 01:44:10.220]  one thing i do know it is unmistakable mistakenly clear
[01:44:10.220 --> 01:44:13.980]  that the democrats have been charged with the actual silence and
[01:44:13.980 --> 01:44:20.300]  assassination and murdering of people that get in their political way a lot
[01:44:20.300 --> 01:44:23.420]  more even more so that we can ever began to think
[01:44:23.420 --> 01:44:26.540]  about the republicans and i'm not for either one they're both politicians
[01:44:26.540 --> 01:44:31.020]  but jesus we need you let the american people turn to you
[01:44:31.020 --> 01:44:35.420]  yes go to the rallies and support but we need a word from the lord and let the
[01:44:35.420 --> 01:44:38.460]  preachers in the pope is get up and start standing up
[01:44:38.460 --> 01:44:44.060]  and preaching your word again not being afraid of the the police or the cia or
[01:44:44.060 --> 01:44:47.900]  homeland security or whosoever wants to come in
[01:44:47.900 --> 01:44:51.740]  and let us all stand together if they come at alex
[01:44:51.740 --> 01:44:55.340]  then let them know that they have to come in all of america we're coming down
[01:44:55.340 --> 01:44:59.660]  out of argan to support alex we're coming out of new hampshire
[01:44:59.660 --> 01:45:04.060]  to support alex you will not be able to get in and out of a jailhouse
[01:45:04.060 --> 01:45:08.780]  if you arrest the voice that represent us you won't be able to go home we will
[01:45:08.780 --> 01:45:14.540]  surround the entire county with a hundred thousand deep of men who are
[01:45:14.540 --> 01:45:17.660]  standing saying the hell we're not going to take it anymore
[01:45:17.660 --> 01:45:21.660]  what we are going to take is back our nation jesus you can do that
[01:45:21.660 --> 01:45:26.380]  you can rally us the way you did giddy and you can rally us almighty god the way
[01:45:26.380 --> 01:45:29.820]  you did david you can rally our troops the way you did
[01:45:29.820 --> 01:45:33.500]  jesus and we're trusting that you do that we pray to this prayer
[01:45:33.500 --> 01:45:38.540]  goes out all over the world that men and women may know but especially here in
[01:45:38.540 --> 01:45:43.900]  america that we can stop all of this and we can salvage our nation in your
[01:45:43.900 --> 01:45:48.060]  name jesus not in our name but in your name and in your name we pray
[01:45:48.060 --> 01:45:52.620]  amen that amen amen and we see the persecution of christians expanding we
[01:45:52.620 --> 01:45:55.580]  see that there is an evil force behind the new world order
[01:45:55.580 --> 01:46:00.140]  pastor manning if that force had its way what would it do on this planet
[01:46:00.140 --> 01:46:04.300]  well what it primarily wants to do is to continue
[01:46:04.300 --> 01:46:08.220]  to call itself into the power of god that's
[01:46:08.220 --> 01:46:12.780]  ultimately what they want to be able to do alex they want to call themselves
[01:46:12.780 --> 01:46:15.660]  into the power of god beyond the present control the
[01:46:15.660 --> 01:46:18.860]  weather control society control the words play god
[01:46:18.860 --> 01:46:23.100]  yeah and they want the they want to dumb down the american people and they're
[01:46:23.100 --> 01:46:26.300]  using the media and we need to talk more about the media i i'm
[01:46:26.300 --> 01:46:30.540]  going to have to go you got to go but we need to talk more about the media being
[01:46:30.540 --> 01:46:33.980]  a surrogate if you start getting into it because they admit that when we have seen
[01:46:33.980 --> 01:46:35.900]  admitting we remember everything we're hillary can
[01:46:35.900 --> 01:46:39.260]  i mean they just admit they're doing it they admit they take orders it's
[01:46:39.260 --> 01:46:42.700]  shameless now yeah but they want to use the media
[01:46:42.700 --> 01:46:46.540]  the way we ought to be using the church they want to use the media
[01:46:46.540 --> 01:46:50.140]  to get people to actually bow down and worship
[01:46:50.140 --> 01:46:56.540]  whatever gods or politicians or ideologies that they put forward
[01:46:56.540 --> 01:47:01.260]  they they want the media uh to be when you you don't have to go to church anymore
[01:47:01.260 --> 01:47:05.660]  you can sit there and you're in your easy chair a lazy boy
[01:47:05.660 --> 01:47:08.780]  and and you can watch whatever you're watching on the media if you're watching
[01:47:08.780 --> 01:47:13.660]  seeing in you're being you're being led to believe a particular
[01:47:13.660 --> 01:47:19.260]  idea they're talking about how their veracity is always on point
[01:47:19.260 --> 01:47:23.020]  they're self-checking themselves and then they bring in their own disciples
[01:47:23.020 --> 01:47:27.180]  who they call commentators to support the things that they're saying
[01:47:27.180 --> 01:47:31.180]  and people are beginning to worship these people they worship people at apple
[01:47:31.180 --> 01:47:36.540]  they worship the leaders of google as if they they worship these people
[01:47:36.540 --> 01:47:39.980]  and so what they want to do is they really want to stand in the place of god
[01:47:39.980 --> 01:47:43.500]  and don't nobody ever forget it that's well there was a there was an ap
[01:47:43.500 --> 01:47:47.980]  headline the other day asking why are these tech company heads obsessed with
[01:47:47.980 --> 01:47:50.540]  eternal life and they'll tell you we're going to merge the
[01:47:50.540 --> 01:47:53.740]  machines and become god we want to be god
[01:47:53.740 --> 01:47:57.420]  absolutely and and they're looking for every possible way
[01:47:57.420 --> 01:48:01.660]  you know i'm really i watched the event of steve jobs and apple
[01:48:01.660 --> 01:48:07.580]  yeah who knows exactly what has happened with steve jobs
[01:48:07.580 --> 01:48:11.260]  and the people call me conspiracy theorist they kill me for sure
[01:48:11.260 --> 01:48:15.020]  hat wearer and all of these kinds of things they say about me
[01:48:15.020 --> 01:48:19.900]  i brush it off and but i think what they're trying to do is to stop me when
[01:48:19.900 --> 01:48:25.340]  i've got something concrete to put to people but i don't have the empirical
[01:48:25.340 --> 01:48:28.780]  evidence to make it work to try to make me look silly
[01:48:28.780 --> 01:48:32.060]  but i don't know what happened to steve jobs i have no idea
[01:48:32.060 --> 01:48:36.220]  i mean we got julie nasan over there in the ecuador
[01:48:36.220 --> 01:48:40.860]  if you will embassy who has been able to feed information and and and give a
[01:48:40.860 --> 01:48:45.020]  support system and he has supported we don't know where all these people are
[01:48:45.020 --> 01:48:49.020]  going or coming we only get what the media tells us
[01:48:49.020 --> 01:48:54.140]  about them jobs still may be around looking to do something i don't know i
[01:48:54.140 --> 01:48:57.660]  don't i don't i don't all i know is i don't believe the media i don't believe
[01:48:57.660 --> 01:49:01.100]  what they tell me no i hear you they lie so much we can't believe any of it it's
[01:49:01.100 --> 01:49:03.740]  like hillary a year and a half ago accused trump
[01:49:03.740 --> 01:49:07.420]  of being an icis recruiter and saying he was their colonel or their
[01:49:07.420 --> 01:49:10.540]  sergeant a recruiting sergeant was the exact term
[01:49:10.540 --> 01:49:14.060]  soros said that then he comes out and points out she's really funding it
[01:49:14.060 --> 01:49:19.980]  and then oh how dare you it's just it's gotten so intense i wonder what levels
[01:49:19.980 --> 01:49:23.180]  above this are going to be like have you seen the club
[01:49:23.180 --> 01:49:26.780]  of the outgoing state department spokesman last week saying what you know
[01:49:26.780 --> 01:49:29.420]  you know we lie to the public and and like laughing about it
[01:49:29.420 --> 01:49:34.460]  now i don't think i've seen that clip no i don't i don't but i do know this
[01:49:34.460 --> 01:49:40.540]  that the that the clinton and obama and others have been involved in the
[01:49:40.540 --> 01:49:45.660]  process of icis involved in the process of creating
[01:49:45.660 --> 01:49:51.100]  an environment where ices thrives listen
[01:49:51.100 --> 01:49:55.660]  there are a number of people who understand if if they ever get in my gun
[01:49:55.660 --> 01:49:59.260]  sights it's all over with they they know it
[01:49:59.260 --> 01:50:05.740]  and if an organization you got an organization is rising with militancy
[01:50:05.740 --> 01:50:10.140]  around the world and the president of the leader of the so-called free world
[01:50:10.140 --> 01:50:15.420]  or the so-called president does not put them in his gun sights
[01:50:15.420 --> 01:50:20.060]  but lets them continue to roam around and to grow and gain power
[01:50:20.060 --> 01:50:25.020]  i gotta ask why is that you know why does that happen because they created it
[01:50:25.020 --> 01:50:29.820]  on record yeah so i mean we have to ask hard questions
[01:50:29.820 --> 01:50:33.500]  and we can't you know one of the things i have to do on a daily basis
[01:50:33.500 --> 01:50:37.980]  alex is i have to fortify myself against people calling me stupid
[01:50:37.980 --> 01:50:43.500]  for questioning these criminals and politics absolutely
[01:50:43.500 --> 01:50:46.860]  being ridiculed means nothing to me but seeing how dumb down some people are
[01:50:46.860 --> 01:50:49.340]  really hurts me like like a globalist see some dumb down
[01:50:49.340 --> 01:50:53.580]  persons as oh that's an opportunity to feed on this person i just see a poor
[01:50:53.580 --> 01:50:57.020]  brainwashed person that makes me feel sick final segment pastor manning then

[01:54:22.060 --> 01:54:27.900]  website every day now i sit here and it's like
[01:54:27.900 --> 01:54:31.340]  the twilight zone like matt dredge said a few days ago
[01:54:31.340 --> 01:54:36.060]  when the father of the guy that murdered all the people at the night club
[01:54:36.060 --> 01:54:41.100]  shows up in the vip area about right behind hillary in the secret service
[01:54:41.100 --> 01:54:44.860]  and she's openly funding i says she openly set it up and advocated for
[01:54:44.860 --> 01:54:47.180]  arming the rebels who they knew who they were
[01:54:47.180 --> 01:54:50.540]  she's involved in all this corruption she's involved the tpp now she says she
[01:54:50.540 --> 01:54:54.540]  was always against it will be against it
[01:54:54.540 --> 01:54:58.300]  and it just becomes ridiculous i mean i wonder
[01:54:58.300 --> 01:55:01.100]  where they're gonna go next then we talk about her health problems i mean i do
[01:55:01.100 --> 01:55:04.940]  see it as biblical like the plagues of faro how
[01:55:04.940 --> 01:55:09.420]  unhealthy bill looks unhealthy hillary looks the fact that
[01:55:09.420 --> 01:55:11.820]  they may be able to steal the election i'm not saying that's going to happen but
[01:55:11.820 --> 01:55:15.500]  even if they do get in there what do you predict is going to happen once she's
[01:55:15.500 --> 01:55:18.140]  in there well there are a couple of things number
[01:55:18.140 --> 01:55:22.860]  one is that i i think we need to to be able to read
[01:55:22.860 --> 01:55:28.940]  the the tea leaves more accurately we we need to focus on what i've seen very
[01:55:28.940 --> 01:55:32.220]  few people focus on and that is the relationship
[01:55:32.220 --> 01:55:39.340]  between between tim kane and hillary clinton uh that
[01:55:39.340 --> 01:55:43.020]  whether it's more than just a political relationship
[01:55:43.020 --> 01:55:47.580]  and i'll leave it at that but i got to tell you we'll find a lot of answers if
[01:55:47.580 --> 01:55:51.340]  we'll go down that road of tim kane and hillary who are
[01:55:51.340 --> 01:55:55.500]  they and and why are they now to try to respond to your
[01:55:55.500 --> 01:55:59.180]  question um you know i was talking to someone the
[01:55:59.180 --> 01:56:02.940]  other day and they said that if you want to find out what's going to happen in
[01:56:02.940 --> 01:56:06.300]  the future watch the cartoons because they put it in the cartoons
[01:56:06.300 --> 01:56:09.580]  the globalist people put it in the cartoons first and see if it works
[01:56:09.580 --> 01:56:13.660]  see if mickey likes it see if the kids like it if the kids like it then they
[01:56:13.660 --> 01:56:16.780]  go ahead and implement it they find out that it works it has a nice
[01:56:16.780 --> 01:56:23.660]  taste and a flavor to it what i would say is that whatever your wildest
[01:56:23.660 --> 01:56:30.300]  imagination can happen uh in america in terms of turning it
[01:56:30.300 --> 01:56:34.060]  upside down right now we've got more hatred
[01:56:34.060 --> 01:56:37.740]  people brother to brother people to people race to race
[01:56:37.740 --> 01:56:41.660]  i mean just the opposite of what they were touting to happen when they put
[01:56:41.660 --> 01:56:45.100]  that long-legged mac daddy obama in the office
[01:56:45.100 --> 01:56:50.940]  and and we've got absolutely nothing done for the people for which the he was
[01:56:50.940 --> 01:56:54.940]  elected to do and everything to do for wall street
[01:56:54.940 --> 01:56:59.340]  the bankers and wealthy people worldwide and for the muslims
[01:56:59.340 --> 01:57:04.380]  i i i mean muslims where they've been around for a very long time
[01:57:04.380 --> 01:57:09.820]  but god knows that obama has lifted them to a pinnacle right now where
[01:57:09.820 --> 01:57:14.860]  the catholics the christians are minorities in comparison to the kind of
[01:57:14.860 --> 01:57:18.140]  press the media the muslims get so what i to try to
[01:57:18.140 --> 01:57:22.460]  answer that question about hillary what is your wildest imagination of of what
[01:57:22.460 --> 01:57:26.380]  she could possibly do and will do because she's gonna want to outdo
[01:57:26.380 --> 01:57:30.940]  obama to be sure that woman is wild she's foaming about the war with russia
[01:57:30.940 --> 01:57:35.740]  yeah she's wild she's wild hillary i mean she's wild and by the way
[01:57:35.740 --> 01:57:38.860]  you know bill is not as bad as hillary even though he looks sick he looks like
[01:57:38.860 --> 01:57:41.980]  he's dying on the way they got him on but it looks like getting ready to die
[01:57:41.980 --> 01:57:45.900]  tomorrow uh first thing tomorrow morning but
[01:57:45.900 --> 01:57:49.180]  he she's a whole lot it's hillary everybody
[01:57:49.180 --> 01:57:52.940]  not bill that you gotta be oh she admittedly ran the show
[01:57:52.940 --> 01:57:55.500]  absolutely she'd been running it for quite some time she's already been
[01:57:55.500 --> 01:57:58.940]  president for at least eight years
[01:58:00.300 --> 01:58:04.300]  that's the way to get around the term limit you just
[01:58:04.300 --> 01:58:08.380]  yeah uh she has a little big glasses coming out of that school that she went
[01:58:08.380 --> 01:58:10.300]  up there and then someplace up there in the
[01:58:10.300 --> 01:58:15.900]  up here in the northeast but yeah i suspect that you one of the what your wildest imagination
[01:58:15.900 --> 01:58:21.820]  of what can possibly happen to this nation uh is going to happen if hillary
[01:58:21.820 --> 01:58:24.380]  sits down in the oval office because that's what they want they want to mount
[01:58:24.380 --> 01:58:27.980]  our head on the wall thank you so much pastor manning it was always great to

[02:00:25.260 --> 02:00:28.540]  look at these headlines they're up on info wars dot com they're up on red support
[02:00:28.540 --> 02:00:32.780]  dot com to poll clinton only up one percent against trump
[02:00:32.780 --> 02:00:35.740]  that's probably a more realistic poll folks internal polling's been done
[02:00:35.740 --> 02:00:39.660]  they're sampling 15 points ahead for hillary and most of them
[02:00:39.660 --> 02:00:43.420]  trumps ahead the problem is they're gonna try to steal the battleground states
[02:00:43.420 --> 02:00:46.540]  the fake polls are about convincing you that he really lost
[02:00:46.540 --> 02:00:50.140]  that's why trump gets that it's not going along with it just like he's a sore
[02:00:50.140 --> 02:00:53.900]  loser they wrote back in april the u.s news and world report and everywhere
[02:00:53.900 --> 02:00:56.940]  else basically he's not following the rules so what
[02:00:56.940 --> 02:01:00.540]  have you won the popular vote buddy
[02:01:00.540 --> 02:01:04.780]  meanwhile apple twitter google instagram collude to defeat trump
[02:01:04.780 --> 02:01:08.140]  media and froths are taking down seeing in we couldn't help
[02:01:08.140 --> 02:01:11.420]  tell her any more than we are
[02:01:11.900 --> 02:01:14.780]  and then we've got
[02:01:15.340 --> 02:01:18.860]  reports here with folks really getting upset really getting angry
[02:01:18.860 --> 02:01:29.020]  seeing in fields the anti-media rage oh yeah it's time to
[02:01:29.020 --> 02:01:33.260]  put any type of heat you can possibly on outlets like cnms nbc especially if
[02:01:33.260 --> 02:01:35.900]  they're doing a live show in your town your city
[02:01:35.900 --> 02:01:38.060]  it's the lead one off or for you if they're out on the street doing a
[02:01:38.060 --> 02:01:39.580]  broadcast whatever to hit them with a bullhorn
[02:01:39.580 --> 02:01:43.740]  by hit them i mean blast them with audio
[02:01:44.460 --> 02:01:46.780]  and that folks ask here in the office they go do you think drudge is playing
[02:01:46.780 --> 02:01:50.220]  this video for why is it the center video
[02:01:50.220 --> 02:01:53.740]  um you know it's just one guy saying f you your traders you know i'm a patriot
[02:01:53.740 --> 02:01:57.260]  to cnn i think what drudge is saying is this is how he feels
[02:01:57.260 --> 02:02:01.100]  am i speaking for drudge i didn't talk to drudge but it's saying this is how you
[02:02:01.100 --> 02:02:04.060]  should really respond to these people we should shun them
[02:02:04.060 --> 02:02:08.300]  or get in their face and say listen you sent people here to blame bernie
[02:02:08.300 --> 02:02:13.660]  sanders and to blame trump hillary did your dirt bags your criminals
[02:02:13.660 --> 02:02:17.980]  but now we're getting in your face okay we're not playing along with you just
[02:02:17.980 --> 02:02:21.660]  like i told pierce morgan look you want our guns stop acting like you want
[02:02:21.660 --> 02:02:26.140]  reasonable gun control you piece of filth you're a foreign agent here trying
[02:02:26.140 --> 02:02:30.620]  to get our guns i want to go to nickin california on the green party
[02:02:30.620 --> 02:02:35.260]  i'll talk to dean and text about trade deal how they're rigged and more
[02:02:35.260 --> 02:02:38.700]  and dug in arizona and many others the toll free number to join us is 800
[02:02:38.700 --> 02:02:45.180]  25 at 9 9 2 3 1 but i'm not going to call us now when i go to the next
[02:02:45.180 --> 02:02:47.820]  segment so i can eat you know give each caller plenty of time but don't cut
[02:02:47.820 --> 02:02:50.860]  somebody short if i go to him now we've got some other clips there's a lot of
[02:02:50.860 --> 02:02:53.660]  amazing clips that are really illustrative of what we're dealing with
[02:02:53.660 --> 02:02:58.300]  the good news is more corruption on hillary using the state department
[02:02:58.300 --> 02:03:02.300]  and her foundation is a giant cash machine where you could buy influence
[02:03:02.300 --> 02:03:06.380]  internationally that is all starting to come out
[02:03:06.380 --> 02:03:10.380]  so more criminal investigations on that front hillary can run but historically
[02:03:10.380 --> 02:03:15.100]  she can't hide i personally have been very very excited
[02:03:15.100 --> 02:03:17.980]  to see a lot of positive things happen the last few weeks
[02:03:17.980 --> 02:03:21.900]  but to really see the worst side of the mainstream media
[02:03:21.900 --> 02:03:30.380]  and to see how gleeful they are in their deception and their attack on the truth
[02:03:30.380 --> 02:03:35.260]  really sets the table for them to do anything you can imagine in the future
[02:03:35.260 --> 02:03:37.980]  and it just is a sickening feeling to be proven
[02:03:37.980 --> 02:03:42.700]  totally right in fact i've been proven wrong this is worse than i thought it
[02:03:42.700 --> 02:03:46.460]  would be at this time in the game
[02:03:46.460 --> 02:03:53.180]  so it is just i'm i i've always had a really good six cents
[02:03:53.180 --> 02:03:58.620]  and um it's been intensifying the last few years but i
[02:03:58.620 --> 02:04:03.500]  i have a feeling of sorrow of loss of
[02:04:03.500 --> 02:04:06.940]  really being frustrated you know there are a lot of new ages and folks that are
[02:04:06.940 --> 02:04:09.580]  great people but they think you're just positive all the time that makes things
[02:04:09.580 --> 02:04:12.700]  positive no that's called being delusional
[02:04:12.700 --> 02:04:15.660]  when you have to go in for surgery for a broken bone or you have to lance a
[02:04:15.660 --> 02:04:18.460]  boil or cut out a wart or something it doesn't feel good at the time but it's
[02:04:18.460 --> 02:04:23.420]  good for you overall and so i am here not dodging the legitimate
[02:04:23.420 --> 02:04:27.500]  suffering i am here facing this garbage every
[02:04:27.500 --> 02:04:31.340]  day head on and because it's what i chose to do
[02:04:31.340 --> 02:04:35.500]  um we're making real headway against evil right now
[02:04:35.500 --> 02:04:41.820]  but it's fighting back and it is um big stuff's already happening horrible
[02:04:41.820 --> 02:04:45.180]  stuff's already happening our government's murdering christians by the
[02:04:45.180 --> 02:04:48.860]  hundreds of thousands is being done in our name we're
[02:04:48.860 --> 02:04:53.180]  paying for it in places like syria and so i think what i really feel is
[02:04:53.180 --> 02:04:59.740]  is god's wrath i i i feel judgment coming down on the world
[02:04:59.740 --> 02:05:03.340]  joe biggs here with info wars dot com article up by express
[02:05:03.340 --> 02:05:07.420]  let refugees into your homes france pleads with citizens to help
[02:05:07.420 --> 02:05:11.100]  ease migrant crisis the same migrant crisis that they allowed to happen

[02:05:13.820 --> 02:05:15.820]  knife so they can cut our throats it'll be fine
[02:05:15.820 --> 02:05:20.300]  there are currently 147 reception centers across france but these are all
[02:05:20.300 --> 02:05:23.740]  in massive demand as desperate refugees continue to flee
[02:05:23.740 --> 02:05:27.420]  the middle east meanwhile barack obama wants to bring these people
[02:05:27.420 --> 02:05:30.780]  into our country unvetted let's not let
[02:05:30.780 --> 02:05:34.700]  any more of this happen that's why we need donald trump to secure the borders
[02:05:34.700 --> 02:05:38.940]  and we need to better vet these people look you have families in germany
[02:05:38.940 --> 02:05:42.300]  fleeing their country the same country the angle of merkel
[02:05:42.300 --> 02:05:45.580]  is allowing these people to come into and they are now going to russia
[02:05:45.580 --> 02:05:49.420]  seeking asylum from these crazed people who most of them
[02:05:49.420 --> 02:05:54.140]  want sharia law open your eyes if we don't secure our borders here in america

[02:07:47.260 --> 02:07:51.580]  lose it's full of stuff that's great for your body period and you support the
[02:07:51.580 --> 02:07:54.860]  broadcast info wars lives dot com thank you doctor group from the global
[02:07:54.860 --> 02:07:59.580]  healing center thank you so much for all your work sir on this great product
[02:08:02.780 --> 02:08:07.900]  you walk into this room at your own risk because it leads to the future
[02:08:07.900 --> 02:08:11.340]  not a future that will be but one that might be
[02:08:11.340 --> 02:08:15.820]  this is not a new world it is simply an extension of
[02:08:15.820 --> 02:08:20.300]  what began in the old one it has patterned itself after every dictator
[02:08:20.300 --> 02:08:24.380]  who has ever planted the ripping imprint of a boot on the pages of history
[02:08:24.380 --> 02:08:29.580]  since the beginning of time it has refinements technological advances and
[02:08:29.580 --> 02:08:34.460]  a more sophisticated approach to the destruction of human freedom
[02:08:34.460 --> 02:08:37.660]  but like every one of the super states that preceded it
[02:08:37.660 --> 02:08:47.820]  it has one iron rule logic is an enemy and truth is a menace
[02:08:47.820 --> 02:08:53.180]  this is mr romney wordsworth in his last 48 hours on earth
[02:08:53.180 --> 02:08:57.180]  he's a citizen of the state but will soon have to be eliminated
[02:08:57.180 --> 02:09:01.980]  because he's built out of flesh and because he has a mind
[02:09:01.980 --> 02:09:18.620]  mr romney wordsworth who will draw his last breaths in the twilight zone
[02:09:18.620 --> 02:09:24.060]  it is friday the 12th day of august 2016 i'm your host Alex Jones
[02:09:24.060 --> 02:09:27.580]  we're going to go to your calls right now during the break
[02:09:27.580 --> 02:09:31.020]  i was monitoring cnn out in the control room and then i walked back out of the
[02:09:31.020 --> 02:09:37.260]  coffee room and got a cup of tea
[02:09:37.260 --> 02:09:40.540]  and fox was on and just as a media person
[02:09:40.540 --> 02:09:43.740]  i could see how it's all scripted now by the same people
[02:09:43.740 --> 02:09:48.300]  fox was run by roger ailes to control the conservative movement but he actually
[02:09:48.300 --> 02:09:52.540]  was a patriot and so hit that spirit was there
[02:09:52.540 --> 02:09:55.820]  but now it's it's it's basically almost fallen
[02:09:55.820 --> 02:09:58.780]  there now you can just see in the months since ailes has been out of the three
[02:09:58.780 --> 02:10:02.060]  weeks they're now already rapidly phasing it out but
[02:10:02.060 --> 02:10:05.500]  they're going to do it quietly strangling it in the dark so it's not
[02:10:05.500 --> 02:10:08.140]  too noticeable
[02:10:08.940 --> 02:10:12.380]  and they'll still be tokenism
[02:10:13.340 --> 02:10:16.780]  but they're getting ready for the big steal but i wouldn't get demoralized by
[02:10:16.780 --> 02:10:20.300]  that even if they stole the selection what we've done injecting truth what
[02:10:20.300 --> 02:10:23.900]  we've done exposing globalism is irrevocable
[02:10:23.900 --> 02:10:29.500]  but i was looking at the cnn anchors and i just felt sorry for them
[02:10:29.500 --> 02:10:33.580]  they're just given a talking point they sit there and banner it back and forth
[02:10:33.580 --> 02:10:37.340]  they create this wall of lies like like we used to
[02:10:37.340 --> 02:10:41.100]  they'd spend here lie there but they still have people's
[02:10:41.100 --> 02:10:47.500]  attention so you know they uh had to be careful about things
[02:10:48.140 --> 02:10:52.380]  but now they know they're caught so just why not go all the way
[02:10:52.380 --> 02:10:57.660]  it's mind boggling and i realized that i've gone from hating these
[02:10:57.660 --> 02:10:59.980]  people
[02:11:00.700 --> 02:11:07.660]  to just just they're just pathetic they really are pathetic
[02:11:07.820 --> 02:11:12.300]  and then somebody like hillary clinton she's like not even a human she's just
[02:11:12.300 --> 02:11:17.260]  you can look at her you wouldn't invite that person over for sunday brunch you
[02:11:17.260 --> 02:11:20.060]  wouldn't go on a camp camping trip with them
[02:11:20.060 --> 02:11:24.380]  you wouldn't be in a book club with them or a chess club or a car club
[02:11:24.380 --> 02:11:28.460]  or a golf club or a church i mean it's just it's like a
[02:11:28.460 --> 02:11:32.620]  creature that just goes around wanting power and just lies and
[02:11:32.620 --> 02:11:38.860]  spins and deceives now hand it to rand paul senator paul that's what made me
[02:11:38.860 --> 02:11:41.900]  love him you know this is bold stands exposing
[02:11:41.900 --> 02:11:44.060]  that
[02:11:44.780 --> 02:11:48.220]  hillary and obama were funding isis in the middle east
[02:11:48.220 --> 02:11:51.580]  that's the senator i wanted to be president
[02:11:51.580 --> 02:11:54.700]  rand paul hillary could get five years in prison for lying to congress about
[02:11:54.700 --> 02:11:57.500]  weapons going to isis and she lied and she sent him
[02:11:57.500 --> 02:12:01.100]  and she testified that she didn't and we've already know that she ordered it
[02:12:01.100 --> 02:12:05.420]  through the uh state department import export group
[02:12:05.420 --> 02:12:12.860]  we've had the very whistleblowers on and that's the testament to info wars
[02:12:14.380 --> 02:12:18.140]  i know the system knows this so that's why i'm going to talk about it but
[02:12:18.140 --> 02:12:27.420]  we were huge 10 years ago we were big 20 years ago
[02:12:28.940 --> 02:12:32.140]  and not because i was that good but because it was just everybody else was
[02:12:32.140 --> 02:12:38.060]  in a trance
[02:12:38.060 --> 02:12:41.820]  i i i i i guess most people like read a couple spy novels and then they think
[02:12:41.820 --> 02:12:45.740]  they know about how clandestine stuff works
[02:12:45.740 --> 02:12:52.700]  instead of actually as a citizen going out and engaging in information warfare organically
[02:12:52.700 --> 02:13:00.540]  as an independent person, I then discovered how it really worked.
[02:13:00.540 --> 02:13:06.740]  And there's no one more depressed than people that aren't evil that are in this system and
[02:13:06.740 --> 02:13:11.260]  then don't know how to get out of it and who don't see an American people that are smart
[02:13:11.260 --> 02:13:14.460]  enough or involved enough for them to even be able to be involved because if they do
[02:13:14.460 --> 02:13:18.140]  get involved, they're just going to get laughed at by a bunch of people that look like they're
[02:13:18.140 --> 02:13:23.180]  trying to make a casting call for idiocracy.
[02:13:23.180 --> 02:13:25.220]  In fact, I watched that clip again.
[02:13:25.220 --> 02:13:26.220]  What's his name?
[02:13:26.220 --> 02:13:30.260]  He was the outgoing head state department spokesman.
[02:13:30.260 --> 02:13:36.620]  Name begins with a C and he laughs and makes fun of everybody and one of the reporters
[02:13:36.620 --> 02:13:41.140]  talks about lying and obfuscation and destroying democracy and then he goes, you actually tell
[02:13:41.140 --> 02:13:46.860]  it to my last day and say, I've only seen a shorter clip when I watched the whole clip.
[02:13:46.860 --> 02:13:51.780]  The guy at the end, I watched it on C-Span kind of just sits there and just breathing
[02:13:51.780 --> 02:13:56.580]  heavy and then like, okay, and then he takes more questions and kind of stumbles off.
[02:13:56.580 --> 02:13:59.820]  So I think that's actually someone freaking out.
[02:13:59.820 --> 02:14:02.360]  I mean, because this is crazy.
[02:14:02.360 --> 02:14:06.860]  You understand our government sent in over 200,000 jihadis with an express mission to
[02:14:06.860 --> 02:14:13.100]  kill every Christian they came across, they've killed over 200,000 Christians, 100,000 non-radical
[02:14:13.100 --> 02:14:14.100]  Muslims.
[02:14:14.100 --> 02:14:25.100]  They've displaced over a million real Syrians and our government directed that.
[02:14:25.100 --> 02:14:30.540]  That's why they let 0.3% Christians and even though they were like 25% of the Syrian population,
[02:14:30.540 --> 02:14:31.540]  they're now 20%.
[02:14:31.540 --> 02:14:32.540]  Look it up.
[02:14:32.540 --> 02:14:36.940]  If you're taking, Obama goes, we've got to be fair.
[02:14:36.940 --> 02:14:37.940]  That's why we're bringing in Muslims.
[02:14:37.940 --> 02:14:38.940]  They're not even bringing Sunnis in.
[02:14:38.940 --> 02:14:43.580]  I mean, they're not even bringing Shiites in, they're bringing Sunnis in.
[02:14:43.580 --> 02:14:48.220]  That's like 98% of what they're bringing in.
[02:14:48.220 --> 02:14:52.540]  And it's like, oh my gosh, they're resettling their jihad army that failed.
[02:14:52.540 --> 02:15:00.460]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, I mean, you're really want to get me.
[02:15:00.460 --> 02:15:01.780]  We're going to go to your calls, I promise.
[02:15:01.780 --> 02:15:04.380]  Like everybody holding, it's a free Hillary for prison shirt.
[02:15:04.380 --> 02:15:06.620]  In fact, John, go through, get their address.
[02:15:06.620 --> 02:15:11.940]  I'm sitting everybody in size, a free Hillary for prison shirt just for holding for an hour.
[02:15:11.940 --> 02:15:15.300]  And throw in a bottle of silver, silver bullet, colloidal silver on top of this 50% off right
[02:15:15.300 --> 02:15:16.300]  now I should add.
[02:15:16.300 --> 02:15:20.620]  This is Mark Toner, former State Department that he quit last week.
[02:15:20.620 --> 02:15:22.020]  Welcome to the State Department.
[02:15:22.020 --> 02:15:24.260]  I think we have some interns in the back.
[02:15:24.260 --> 02:15:25.260]  Welcome.
[02:15:25.260 --> 02:15:32.340]  Good to see you in this exercise in transparency and democracy.
[02:15:32.340 --> 02:15:36.260]  Is that what it is?
[02:15:36.260 --> 02:15:40.020]  Sorry, I didn't mean to break up.
[02:15:40.020 --> 02:15:46.620]  I thought it was an exercise in spin and obfuscation.
[02:15:46.620 --> 02:15:49.700]  All right, can you tell us my last briefing?
[02:15:49.700 --> 02:15:51.860]  Now they've got the new girl.
[02:15:51.860 --> 02:15:57.140]  This is from yesterday, the new girls there, and this is them spinning and obfuscating
[02:15:57.140 --> 02:16:01.940]  now from the same lectern covering up for Hillary and what the State Department has
[02:16:01.940 --> 02:16:02.940]  done.
[02:16:02.940 --> 02:16:06.780]  So let's play that clip and we're going to Dean and Nick and William and Doug and Bob
[02:16:06.780 --> 02:16:07.780]  and others.
[02:16:07.780 --> 02:16:08.780]  Go ahead and play that clip.
[02:16:08.780 --> 02:16:15.780]  Do you have any response to criticism by some that suggest there was a relationship between
[02:16:15.780 --> 02:16:19.180]  the Clinton Foundation and the State Department at the time?
[02:16:19.180 --> 02:16:24.700]  There is an email that came out in this recent set that is between the – an executive at
[02:16:24.700 --> 02:16:29.700]  the Clinton Foundation and Huma Amadeem and Cheryl Mills, where he is requesting to set
[02:16:29.700 --> 02:16:34.500]  up a meeting between a billionaire donor and the U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon.
[02:16:34.500 --> 02:16:38.940]  Do you have any response to – so very similar to what I said before.
[02:16:38.940 --> 02:16:41.060]  I'm not going to speak to specific emails.
[02:16:41.060 --> 02:16:46.460]  However, I think you guys know State Department officials are regularly in touch with a wide
[02:16:46.460 --> 02:16:53.540]  variety of outside individuals and organizations, including businesses, nonprofits, NGOs, think
[02:16:53.540 --> 02:16:54.540]  tanks.
[02:16:54.540 --> 02:17:00.180]  The nearly 55,000 pages of former Secretary Clinton's emails released by the Department
[02:17:00.180 --> 02:17:06.100]  over the past year give a sense of the wide range of individuals both inside and outside
[02:17:06.100 --> 02:17:10.580]  government that State Department officials are in contact with on a range of subjects.
[02:17:10.580 --> 02:17:16.700]  So you don't feel like this email or you don't feel like there is impropriety in the
[02:17:16.700 --> 02:17:19.740]  relationship between the Clinton Foundation and the State Department at the time?
[02:17:19.740 --> 02:17:25.980]  We talk to a wide range of people at my level, at various levels in the department.
[02:17:25.980 --> 02:17:29.780]  This is Hillary with the foundation that she's getting money, and then the world leaders
[02:17:29.780 --> 02:17:35.020]  contact the State Department to be hooked up with it so that they'll take the weapons
[02:17:35.020 --> 02:17:36.300]  bans and other things off.
[02:17:36.300 --> 02:17:41.980]  This is her selling U.S. policy with her big fat butt hanging out in her face.
[02:17:41.980 --> 02:17:46.140]  This is like you come home and your neighbor is having sex with your wife on the hood of
[02:17:46.140 --> 02:17:52.820]  your car in front of the neighbor at a volleyball party, and you go, Bob, you're on my wife.
[02:17:52.820 --> 02:17:54.420]  No, I'm not, Bill.
[02:17:54.420 --> 02:17:56.420]  Yeah, you are.
[02:17:56.420 --> 02:18:00.220]  Hold on just a minute, and he finishes up in front of you and then stands there naked
[02:18:00.220 --> 02:18:02.620]  in front of you going, well, you're crazy, man.
[02:18:02.620 --> 02:18:03.620]  Nothing's going on here.
[02:18:03.620 --> 02:18:07.660]  I hate to use a vulgar analogy, but that's what this is like, and this is the new pinhead
[02:18:07.660 --> 02:18:09.460]  they've rolled out.
[02:18:09.460 --> 02:18:10.460]  But you know what?
[02:18:10.460 --> 02:18:13.500]  The press goes along with this, so this is what you deserve.
[02:18:13.500 --> 02:18:17.060]  And when they take your pension funds and when the whole economy collapses and cities
[02:18:17.060 --> 02:18:23.220]  are burning, just remember Hillary's going to be on a private jet out of here, okay?
[02:18:23.220 --> 02:18:25.900]  Remember, you sold your country out because you thought it was cute.
[02:18:25.900 --> 02:18:26.900]  Here it is.
[02:18:26.900 --> 02:18:32.340]  Well, at various levels in the department, NGOs, think tanks, business leaders, you
[02:18:32.340 --> 02:18:35.540]  know, experts on a variety of subjects.
[02:18:35.540 --> 02:18:42.340]  Except in this, and importantly, in this case, Secretary Clinton made a pledge that she would
[02:18:42.340 --> 02:18:49.140]  not personally or substantially in any way involve herself with the Clinton Foundation.
[02:18:49.140 --> 02:18:54.420]  So it's not just any outside organization, it's the civic organization that she said
[02:18:54.420 --> 02:18:56.860]  ahead of time she wouldn't have contact with.
[02:18:56.860 --> 02:19:01.940]  So doesn't that, doesn't this then seem to violate that pledge?
[02:19:01.940 --> 02:19:07.540]  So, again, to reiterate, you know, department officials are in touch with-
[02:19:07.540 --> 02:19:13.700]  This is their pseudo-intellectual thing they do when they go, again, again, two plus two
[02:19:13.700 --> 02:19:24.100]  equals nine, no, ma'am, it equals four, again, again, again, again, we're so intellectual.
[02:19:24.100 --> 02:19:25.100]  Let's go back.
[02:19:25.100 --> 02:19:30.540]  Again, to reiterate, you know, department officials are in touch with a wide range of individuals.
[02:19:30.540 --> 02:19:36.420]  I'd note that former Secretary Clinton's ethics agreement did not preclude other State Department
[02:19:36.420 --> 02:19:40.060]  officials from having contact with Clinton Foundation staff.
[02:19:40.060 --> 02:19:41.060]  Okay.
[02:19:41.060 --> 02:19:49.620]  Can you at least try to answer Abigail's question, which was, is the department looked into this
[02:19:49.620 --> 02:19:53.020]  and determined that there was no impropriety?
[02:19:53.020 --> 02:19:56.700]  The department is regularly in touch with people across the whole spectrum, ma'am.
[02:19:56.700 --> 02:19:57.700]  That's not the question.
[02:19:57.700 --> 02:20:02.420]  The question is whether or not you looked into this, this, the building is looked into
[02:20:02.420 --> 02:20:05.260]  it and determined that everything was okay, that there was nothing wrong.
[02:20:05.260 --> 02:20:10.300]  We feel confident in our ability and our past practice of reaching out to a variety of sources
[02:20:10.300 --> 02:20:11.300]  and being responsive to us.
[02:20:11.300 --> 02:20:12.300]  I'm sorry.
[02:20:12.300 --> 02:20:13.900]  Am I not speaking English?
[02:20:13.900 --> 02:20:18.300]  Is this, I mean, is it coming across as a form, not asking you if, no one is saying
[02:20:18.300 --> 02:20:20.380]  it's not okay or it's bad.
[02:20:20.380 --> 02:20:21.900]  Have you looked into it, dumbass?
[02:20:21.900 --> 02:20:28.260]  A broad variety of input from different people to ask the question is whether or not you
[02:20:28.260 --> 02:20:31.460]  determined that there was nothing improper here.
[02:20:31.460 --> 02:20:35.140]  We feel confident that all the rules were followed.
[02:20:35.140 --> 02:20:36.140]  There you go.
[02:20:36.140 --> 02:20:40.260]  She's just under all these criminal investigations, more emails are coming out and we're not looking
[02:20:40.260 --> 02:20:41.260]  into it.
[02:20:41.260 --> 02:20:42.500]  That's the answer.
[02:20:42.500 --> 02:20:48.780]  State Department not wiping its own rear end and look, I get your crap and all over us
[02:20:48.780 --> 02:20:51.820]  but have the decency to not rub it in, lady.
[02:20:51.820 --> 02:20:56.180]  You look at this poor soft pinhead woman lives in the Beltway, probably can't even cook
[02:20:56.180 --> 02:21:00.620]  dinner for her kids if she's got them and she's just got two or three degrees as a political
[02:21:00.620 --> 02:21:07.980]  hack just thrown in here for the fall of America with some tottering weird psycho crone bragging
[02:21:07.980 --> 02:21:11.340]  about everybody that she kills.
[02:21:11.340 --> 02:21:13.700]  Only one of the freak I know does that and that's Obama.
[02:21:13.700 --> 02:21:17.700]  I guess Richard Pearl, Richard Pearl waddles up at cocktail parties, this has been the
[02:21:17.700 --> 02:21:24.060]  latest to the hottest woman in them, weighing like 350 pounds in a suit with huge black circles
[02:21:24.060 --> 02:21:31.660]  around his eyes and then tells women, I order the wars that kill massive numbers of people.
[02:21:31.660 --> 02:21:35.620]  Richard Pearl, that's not what turns women on, jackass.
[02:21:35.620 --> 02:21:45.340]  I mean, again, it shows the total disconnect of these people, the total complete disconnect.
[02:21:45.340 --> 02:21:54.260]  It's like Kim Jong-un thinks that having some bizarro Dennis Rodman basketball player there
[02:21:54.260 --> 02:21:59.460]  is cool with his top generals clapping while they sit there and watch him play an exhibition
[02:21:59.460 --> 02:22:00.460]  game.
[02:22:00.460 --> 02:22:07.340]  I mean, it just shows we're ruled by the most aberrant freakazoid crazy people because normal
[02:22:07.340 --> 02:22:12.820]  people don't want to tell people what to do.
[02:22:12.820 --> 02:22:16.260]  Black kids might be a little spoiled sometimes because I just, I don't want to run their
[02:22:16.260 --> 02:22:17.260]  lives.
[02:22:17.260 --> 02:22:19.820]  Shame, I just can't handle it anymore.
[02:22:19.820 --> 02:22:21.900]  Why are we ruled by filth?
[02:22:21.900 --> 02:22:23.740]  What is going on in North Korea?
[02:22:23.740 --> 02:22:24.740]  What is that joke?
[02:22:24.740 --> 02:22:25.740]  What is that?
[02:22:25.740 --> 02:22:29.900]  What is that?
[02:22:29.900 --> 02:22:30.900]  What is Hitler?
[02:22:30.900 --> 02:22:31.900]  What is Stalin?
[02:22:31.900 --> 02:22:32.900]  What is Mao?
[02:22:32.900 --> 02:22:33.900]  What is all this stuff?
[02:22:33.900 --> 02:22:39.220]  What is Venezuela collapsing into hell?
[02:22:39.220 --> 02:22:43.300]  I can go to UT right now and hat the students, they'll be calling for communism, running
[02:22:43.300 --> 02:22:47.220]  around on their smartphones.
[02:22:47.220 --> 02:22:54.340]  I can't look at Hillary Clinton or Kim Jong-un anymore, oh, little eyes, the little pow, the
[02:22:54.340 --> 02:23:04.460]  little demon look, the little pow, pow, pow, and then no one stands up to him.
[02:23:04.460 --> 02:23:11.220]  Richard Perl drifting around under the Prince of Darkness in a black suit with like little
[02:23:11.220 --> 02:23:16.740]  warts on his cheeks, sauntering over to a 30-year-old in a Washington Post reporter
[02:23:16.740 --> 02:23:24.420]  and going, ah, you know I'm powerful, I command forces to kill people, and they're like, ugh.
[02:23:24.420 --> 02:23:31.180]  But see, they know to recoil from it, but the women don't recoil from that whole sickening
[02:23:31.180 --> 02:23:32.180]  culture itself.
[02:23:32.180 --> 02:23:36.980]  And that's what Drudge is saying with that video, seeing and feels anti-media rage.
[02:23:36.980 --> 02:23:40.460]  I'm going to play the video coming up in the next segment.
[02:23:40.460 --> 02:23:46.740]  But it's just time to say, look, scum, you are filth, and we see you for what you are.
[02:23:46.740 --> 02:23:48.940]  All right, I'm going to your calls.
[02:23:48.940 --> 02:23:53.620]  William in Tennessee is on WBCR 1470 and go to him after I talk to Nick, who's listening
[02:23:53.620 --> 02:23:59.980]  on 1340 AM co-KOMY at Santa Cruz, Dean and others, we're going to everybody, so thank
[02:23:59.980 --> 02:24:01.260]  you for holding, you're all getting your free.
[02:24:01.260 --> 02:24:05.380]  He'll give you a present shirt and a free bottle of little silver for me making a hold
[02:24:05.380 --> 02:24:06.380]  over an hour.
[02:24:06.380 --> 02:24:08.460]  I'm going to start doing that every time it's over an hour.
[02:24:08.460 --> 02:24:13.020]  John just kicks in, they got a free t-shirt or a little silver or basically whatever they
[02:24:13.020 --> 02:24:14.020]  want.
[02:24:14.020 --> 02:24:15.860]  It's just under $20 because I can't afford that.
[02:24:15.860 --> 02:24:18.020]  Let's go ahead and go to Nick.
[02:24:18.020 --> 02:24:20.420]  Nick, you're in California.
[02:24:20.420 --> 02:24:23.300]  Am I going to get good stuff in my stocking this year?
[02:24:23.300 --> 02:24:24.900]  Hey man, thank you.
[02:24:24.900 --> 02:24:25.900]  Well, I'm calling you.
[02:24:25.900 --> 02:24:26.900]  Yes, sir.
[02:24:26.900 --> 02:24:32.020]  I have a comment and two questions and I'm just going to unload with them.
[02:24:32.020 --> 02:24:35.300]  It's politics that the Monterey County has thrown as far as just reached the top 10 neon
[02:24:35.300 --> 02:24:36.300]  penance territory.
[02:24:36.300 --> 02:24:37.300]  Questions?
[02:24:37.300 --> 02:24:45.180]  Radar, Jack, Hillary's email is loose enough to endanger Iranian nuclear scientists.
[02:24:45.180 --> 02:24:46.180]  You're stocking.
[02:24:46.180 --> 02:24:48.700]  Well, let's talk about greens.
[02:24:48.700 --> 02:24:49.700]  Nobody's doing it yet.
[02:24:49.700 --> 02:24:50.700]  That's a surprise attack.
[02:24:50.700 --> 02:24:51.700]  We'll get them.
[02:24:51.700 --> 02:24:52.700]  I mean, Obama again.
[02:24:52.700 --> 02:24:55.220]  Let's hear it out here, Nick.
[02:24:55.220 --> 02:24:59.300]  Yeah, the Green Party, the libertarians, everybody should not vote for those ringers.
[02:24:59.300 --> 02:25:03.100]  I'm normally the third parties to grow them because you have two bad candidates usually.
[02:25:03.100 --> 02:25:04.100]  Everyone should be all in Trump.
[02:25:04.100 --> 02:25:06.580]  The entire power structure is against Trump.
[02:25:06.580 --> 02:25:08.100]  William in Tennessee, you're on the year.
[02:25:08.100 --> 02:25:09.100]  Go ahead.
[02:25:09.100 --> 02:25:10.100]  Yeah.
[02:25:10.100 --> 02:25:13.100]  I want to talk about your alleged voter fraud.
[02:25:13.100 --> 02:25:21.460]  Out of a billion votes cast of 2000 on a local study, 31 instances of irregularities.
[02:25:21.460 --> 02:25:26.060]  So what's your source of that, Snopes?
[02:25:26.060 --> 02:25:27.060]  Loyal University.
[02:25:27.060 --> 02:25:28.060]  Okay.
[02:25:28.060 --> 02:25:32.340]  We'll send it to me because, I mean, I mean, this country's famous for voter fraud.
[02:25:32.340 --> 02:25:33.980]  We have international watch groups.
[02:25:33.980 --> 02:25:35.740]  We go look at other elections.
[02:25:35.740 --> 02:25:37.500]  There's constant issues with elections.
[02:25:37.500 --> 02:25:44.180]  I have witnessed election fraud myself when I was involved in elections following it.
[02:25:44.180 --> 02:25:49.540]  Have had the state certify that was fraud, but still certify the election.
[02:25:49.540 --> 02:25:53.100]  Those die-bolt machines, their own engineers have said they've been ordered to hack stuff
[02:25:53.100 --> 02:25:54.100]  all over the country.
[02:25:54.100 --> 02:25:59.740]  I mean, just to say that there's only 30-something instances of election fraud.
[02:25:59.740 --> 02:26:02.740]  See, there's voter fraud and then election fraud, sir.
[02:26:02.740 --> 02:26:04.940]  You know the difference, right?
[02:26:04.940 --> 02:26:08.340]  There's no, voter fraud is infinitesimal in this country.
[02:26:08.340 --> 02:26:09.340]  Okay.
[02:26:09.340 --> 02:26:11.060]  You don't even understand me.
[02:26:11.060 --> 02:26:12.060]  I understand.
[02:26:12.060 --> 02:26:13.060]  Look, I don't want to argue with you.
[02:26:13.060 --> 02:26:14.060]  It's probably just that we can't.
[02:26:14.060 --> 02:26:18.060]  Listen, I'm going to give you the floor for 60 seconds, but let me see if you understand
[02:26:18.060 --> 02:26:19.060]  this.
[02:26:19.060 --> 02:26:24.180]  The real voter fraud is individuals engaged in double voting or dead people voting, okay?
[02:26:24.180 --> 02:26:28.580]  And then election fraud is organized at at least the, you know, precinct or county level.
[02:26:28.580 --> 02:26:29.580]  Okay.
[02:26:29.580 --> 02:26:31.580]  Do you understand what I'm saying, sir?
[02:26:31.580 --> 02:26:35.500]  Yes, but I just thought it doesn't exist, but go right ahead.
[02:26:35.500 --> 02:26:38.020]  You just said it doesn't exist, but go on ahead.
[02:26:38.020 --> 02:26:45.300]  You can go to the history of voter news services alone and then on online encyclopedia and
[02:26:45.300 --> 02:26:48.620]  then look at the bibliographies of all the mainstream news articles where every election
[02:26:48.620 --> 02:26:50.540]  there's giant fraud and problems.
[02:26:50.540 --> 02:26:51.540]  So they always change their name.
[02:26:51.540 --> 02:26:56.340]  But you say election fraud, so Kennedy didn't steal Illinois and LBJ didn't get into Congress
[02:26:56.340 --> 02:26:57.340]  stealing.
[02:26:57.340 --> 02:26:58.340]  That's admitted.
[02:26:58.340 --> 02:26:59.340]  Oh, really?
[02:26:59.340 --> 02:27:00.340]  Hold on.
[02:27:00.340 --> 02:27:01.340]  Hold on.
[02:27:01.340 --> 02:27:02.340]  Hold on, brother.
[02:27:02.340 --> 02:27:03.340]  Hold on.
[02:27:03.340 --> 02:27:05.340]  Just a minute.
[02:27:05.340 --> 02:27:09.380]  You know about Jim Crow laws and the huge move to suppress black votes in this country
[02:27:09.380 --> 02:27:10.980]  and poor sharecroppers votes?
[02:27:10.980 --> 02:27:15.540]  I'm talking about current election cycle you're referring to.
[02:27:15.540 --> 02:27:17.620]  The current election cycle hasn't even happened.
[02:27:17.620 --> 02:27:18.620]  Wait a minute.
[02:27:18.620 --> 02:27:19.620]  Wait a minute.
[02:27:19.620 --> 02:27:25.300]  We just saw them ignore the popular vote for Bernie Sanders and give it to Hillary Clinton.
[02:27:25.300 --> 02:27:27.620]  What planet are you living on?
[02:27:27.620 --> 02:27:31.580]  Hamlet University, School of Business, State Department, Minnesota.
[02:27:31.580 --> 02:27:32.580]  Professor David Schultz.
[02:27:32.580 --> 02:27:33.580]  Oh, my gosh.
[02:27:33.580 --> 02:27:34.580]  Oh, like that.
[02:27:34.580 --> 02:27:38.180]  A professor in Illinois that says the founding fathers were against guns.
[02:27:38.180 --> 02:27:39.500]  Of course, he lost his job.
[02:27:39.500 --> 02:27:41.340]  It wasn't true, but go ahead.
[02:27:41.340 --> 02:27:42.340]  Okay.
[02:27:42.340 --> 02:27:47.500]  Alex, again, there is an infantessimal voter and election fraud in this country.
[02:27:47.500 --> 02:27:50.660]  There is no rigged election priority that's going to happen.
[02:27:50.660 --> 02:27:51.660]  Trump is lying.
[02:27:51.660 --> 02:27:52.660]  He's making it up.
[02:27:52.660 --> 02:27:53.660]  He's going to lose.
[02:27:53.660 --> 02:27:54.660]  There is no voter fraud.
[02:27:54.660 --> 02:27:55.660]  You cannot prove.
[02:27:55.660 --> 02:27:56.660]  William, what do you do for a living?
[02:27:56.660 --> 02:27:57.660]  Are you a social worker?
[02:27:57.660 --> 02:27:58.660]  If you can prove voter fraud, please.
[02:27:58.660 --> 02:27:59.660]  Are you a social worker?
[02:27:59.660 --> 02:28:00.660]  That's irrelevant.
[02:28:00.660 --> 02:28:01.660]  Please tell me.
[02:28:01.660 --> 02:28:10.660]  If you could provide evidence of voter fraud, a list for me, proof and documentation, please.
[02:28:10.660 --> 02:28:13.700]  Well, that's a classic non-debate tactic.
[02:28:13.700 --> 02:28:18.900]  We filed tons of reports this last week and this week on infowars.com with video reports
[02:28:18.900 --> 02:28:21.060]  showing admissions of election fraud.
[02:28:21.060 --> 02:28:25.140]  Bev Harris, frequent guest is coming on next week, made the hacking democracy that aired
[02:28:25.140 --> 02:28:29.420]  on HBO and won a bunch of awards, proving major fraud in Ohio.
[02:28:29.420 --> 02:28:31.420]  They certified national fraud that went on.
[02:28:31.420 --> 02:28:33.180]  I mean, this is ongoing, sir.
[02:28:33.180 --> 02:28:36.540]  You're like, I mean, do you want me to prove there's a blue sky outside because it is blue
[02:28:36.540 --> 02:28:37.540]  sky in Austin?
[02:28:37.540 --> 02:28:41.980]  Now, in Japan, I think it's nighttime, right?
[02:28:41.980 --> 02:28:43.980]  I mean, I'm not proving it.
[02:28:43.980 --> 02:28:45.460]  You cannot source your own website.
[02:28:45.460 --> 02:28:46.460]  Are they sourced?
[02:28:46.460 --> 02:28:47.460]  No, it's not.
[02:28:47.460 --> 02:28:48.460]  I just said HBO.
[02:28:48.460 --> 02:28:50.980]  Have you heard of Homebox Office?
[02:28:50.980 --> 02:28:51.980]  Hold on.
[02:28:51.980 --> 02:28:53.980]  Have you heard of Homebox Office?
[02:28:53.980 --> 02:28:54.980]  Yes.
[02:28:54.980 --> 02:28:58.380]  Do you believe there's a documentary called Hacking Democracy?
[02:28:58.380 --> 02:29:03.340]  A documentary does not prove a voter fraud.
[02:29:03.340 --> 02:29:06.700]  Can you give me evidence of voter fraud?
[02:29:06.700 --> 02:29:12.140]  Sir, I can pull up for you right now congressional and state testimony by die-bold executives
[02:29:12.140 --> 02:29:16.460]  and chief engineers about organized fraud and elections that were stolen under orders
[02:29:16.460 --> 02:29:19.900]  and patches put on on computers to seal elections, sir.
[02:29:19.900 --> 02:29:22.340]  What are those links then?
[02:29:22.340 --> 02:29:25.940]  Well, I mean, we've written news articles about it, but you're just hoping the audience
[02:29:25.940 --> 02:29:28.100]  is stupid and doesn't know about this.
[02:29:28.100 --> 02:29:31.940]  We've written articles with those links, without information in there.
[02:29:31.940 --> 02:29:37.060]  And I mean, is this your poor, pathetic attempt to try to imply that we shouldn't try to
[02:29:37.060 --> 02:29:40.620]  protect the integrity of our election system in this country?
[02:29:40.620 --> 02:29:44.620]  Are you denying that super delegates took votes from Bernie Sanders?
[02:29:44.620 --> 02:29:48.060]  Superdolleges didn't want to do it, Alex.
[02:29:48.060 --> 02:29:49.060]  There's no such thing.
[02:29:49.060 --> 02:29:50.060]  That's right.
[02:29:50.060 --> 02:29:51.060]  We found one candidate.
[02:29:51.060 --> 02:29:54.300]  You think you're part of the power structure?
[02:29:54.300 --> 02:29:55.300]  I get it.
[02:29:55.300 --> 02:30:00.060]  You probably can't even tie your shoelaces.
[02:30:00.060 --> 02:30:06.100]  State emails show Soros urged Clinton to intervene in Albania's civil unrest.
[02:30:06.100 --> 02:30:10.700]  Article up by the American Mirror, morally emails from Hillary Clinton's time as Secretary
[02:30:10.700 --> 02:30:16.380]  of State prove that she was taking foreign policy advice from left-wing billionaire activist
[02:30:16.380 --> 02:30:21.860]  George Soros, the same guy who was bringing civil unrest around the world.
[02:30:21.860 --> 02:30:27.180]  An email provided by WikiLeaks showed Soros reaching out to Secretary Clinton over a foreign
[02:30:27.180 --> 02:30:29.580]  policy dispute in Albania.
[02:30:29.580 --> 02:30:33.820]  Under Hillary, a serious situation has arisen in Albania which needs urgent attention at
[02:30:33.820 --> 02:30:35.540]  senior levels of the U.S. government.
[02:30:35.540 --> 02:30:40.420]  There are serious concerns about further unrest connected to a counter demonstration.
[02:30:40.420 --> 02:30:44.300]  Soros urges the then Secretary of State to get the international community involved in
[02:30:44.300 --> 02:30:49.180]  pressure, the prime minister, to forestall further demonstrations and tone down public
[02:30:49.180 --> 02:30:54.980]  pronouncements as well appointing a senior European official to act as the mediator.
[02:30:54.980 --> 02:31:01.980]  This has been Joe Biggs with Infowars.com.
[02:31:24.980 --> 02:31:31.980]  This has been Joe Biggs with Infowars.com.
[02:31:54.980 --> 02:32:07.860]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful
[02:32:07.860 --> 02:32:11.340]  and affordable, great tasting multivitamin formula available.
[02:32:11.340 --> 02:32:16.740]  The all-new vitamin mineral fusion drink mix at InfowarsLife.com is loaded with a full
[02:32:16.740 --> 02:32:21.980]  month supply of essential vitamins, minerals and amino acids that your body absolutely
[02:32:21.980 --> 02:32:22.980]  needs.
[02:32:22.980 --> 02:32:27.220]  In the history of InfowarsLife, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival
[02:32:27.220 --> 02:32:30.660]  Shield X2, Super Metal Vitality and so many others.
[02:32:30.660 --> 02:32:35.540]  But I am most proud of the product we're now launching today with its unique delivery
[02:32:35.540 --> 02:32:40.340]  system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects.
[02:32:40.340 --> 02:32:44.700]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[02:32:44.700 --> 02:32:50.140]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest
[02:32:50.140 --> 02:32:51.900]  quality lab standard.
[02:32:51.900 --> 02:32:53.300]  That means it's clean.
[02:32:53.300 --> 02:32:54.300]  That means it's pure.
[02:32:54.300 --> 02:32:57.380]  That's InfowarsLife.com and vitamin mineral fusion.
[02:32:57.380 --> 02:33:11.780]  Take action now before we sell out.
[02:33:11.780 --> 02:33:17.100]  Before America can be great again, she must be free again.
[02:33:17.100 --> 02:33:26.820]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:33:26.820 --> 02:33:29.500]  You notice that I said, are you a social worker?
[02:33:29.500 --> 02:33:34.620]  He said, I'm not going to talk about what I do.
[02:33:34.620 --> 02:33:38.820]  About half the time I asked that question, they turned out to be social workers.
[02:33:38.820 --> 02:33:43.940]  And being on radio more than 20 years, you learn and then back in the old days we would
[02:33:43.940 --> 02:33:49.540]  actually get memos from the radio network I was on, channel communications before GCN,
[02:33:49.540 --> 02:33:52.620]  that look out for these seminar callers.
[02:33:52.620 --> 02:34:00.780]  And a lot of times government social workers basically are given by their union talking
[02:34:00.780 --> 02:34:03.820]  points, phone numbers and who to target.
[02:34:03.820 --> 02:34:06.700]  And they'll just say, you're lying, you're lying, you're lying, fire engines aren't
[02:34:06.700 --> 02:34:11.140]  red, fire engines aren't red, and it's just meant to create disbelief in people.
[02:34:11.140 --> 02:34:14.300]  And you have to remember, these social workers, and there's some nice social workers, I want
[02:34:14.300 --> 02:34:19.940]  to be clear, they're used to dealing with mentally retarded people, really old folks,
[02:34:19.940 --> 02:34:22.420]  criminals, abused children, you name it.
[02:34:22.420 --> 02:34:24.100]  So there's kind of an elitism to it.
[02:34:24.100 --> 02:34:27.260]  You see, everybody's an idiot but them.
[02:34:27.260 --> 02:34:31.540]  And I tell you what I'm going to do just for that caller, I'm going to take that call
[02:34:31.540 --> 02:34:36.340]  and then I'm going to create about a 10 minute video with Josh O and Zimmerman, whoever wants
[02:34:36.340 --> 02:34:37.340]  to do it.
[02:34:37.340 --> 02:34:42.140]  And somebody tell me you're going to do it or I'll assign it, the crew's always chomping
[02:34:42.140 --> 02:34:43.780]  the bit to do stuff.
[02:34:43.780 --> 02:34:48.220]  And we're just going to take clips of congressional testimony and state testimony and Bible executives
[02:34:48.220 --> 02:34:53.100]  and hackers hacking into elections and CBS News admitting it's a problem and then election
[02:34:53.100 --> 02:34:57.180]  fraud and illegals voting and dead people voting and dead people getting social security
[02:34:57.180 --> 02:34:59.260]  and dead people getting IRS tax returns.
[02:34:59.260 --> 02:35:11.780]  I mean, James O'Keefe of Project Veritas went in and voted as M&M recently.
[02:35:11.780 --> 02:35:15.420]  All these battleground states basically have changed laws where anybody can vote.
[02:35:15.420 --> 02:35:18.580]  In fact, I'm not stupid because if I did it, they'll arrest me.
[02:35:18.580 --> 02:35:26.220]  I could go vote repeatedly in Travis County, but I'm not going to do it.
[02:35:26.220 --> 02:35:34.220]  And you just heard a caller that I'm going back to your calls who literally just said,
[02:35:34.220 --> 02:35:35.860]  there's a Loyola University thing.
[02:35:35.860 --> 02:35:36.860]  We pulled it up.
[02:35:36.860 --> 02:35:38.660]  It was totally shot down.
[02:35:38.660 --> 02:35:42.620]  The professor did a little study and said he couldn't find a bunch of examples.
[02:35:42.620 --> 02:35:47.700]  Well, my God, that's like saying, I walked out in my backyard and, you know, I couldn't
[02:35:47.700 --> 02:35:49.660]  find a Tyrannosaurus Rex skull.
[02:35:49.660 --> 02:35:52.220]  So maybe no fossils have ever been found.
[02:35:52.220 --> 02:35:53.220]  And let's scroll back up.
[02:35:53.220 --> 02:35:59.460]  I mean, I love the fake ironic purple glasses of Chris Hedges.
[02:35:59.460 --> 02:36:02.380]  That's that MSNBC host name, right?
[02:36:02.380 --> 02:36:07.500]  You know, this whole, that's Rachel Maddow's, yeah, yeah, okay.
[02:36:07.500 --> 02:36:13.700]  Voter fraud deniers resurface just in time for midterm elections.
[02:36:13.700 --> 02:36:21.860]  I mean, we've got California and Illinois and Oregon and Vermont introducing legislation
[02:36:21.860 --> 02:36:26.300]  that last time I heard Illinois passed and was on the governor's desk.
[02:36:26.300 --> 02:36:34.300]  Did that pass legalizing illegals voting?
[02:36:34.300 --> 02:36:41.300]  So we're going to take all those clips and put it to that seminar caller.
[02:36:41.300 --> 02:36:44.580]  I bet that seminar caller is just reeling.
[02:36:44.580 --> 02:36:46.500]  How would I know he's a social worker?
[02:36:46.500 --> 02:36:51.260]  How would I, because I'm smart dumbass, unlike you.
[02:36:51.260 --> 02:36:53.100]  I don't think I'm part of the establishment.
[02:36:53.100 --> 02:36:58.860]  I don't want to go rule over a bunch of old people and retarded children like you do.
[02:36:58.860 --> 02:36:59.860]  Okay.
[02:36:59.860 --> 02:37:04.900]  So I know you, I know you have old, there you go.
[02:37:04.900 --> 02:37:07.540]  But you really ought to be ashamed of yourself.
[02:37:07.540 --> 02:37:13.660]  My audience consists of common folks, right up to rocket scientists and foreign leaders.
[02:37:13.660 --> 02:37:14.660]  But you know what?
[02:37:14.660 --> 02:37:20.380]  The most common person is better, even if they're not that smart on average, because
[02:37:20.380 --> 02:37:23.500]  their heart loves God and loves justice.
[02:37:23.500 --> 02:37:26.820]  But you know you were lying and implying there's no election fraud or no voter fraud.
[02:37:26.820 --> 02:37:31.900]  That was ridiculous.
[02:37:31.900 --> 02:37:33.540]  Now here's James O'Keeffe's piece.
[02:37:33.540 --> 02:37:36.380]  Let's put the article up on screen for TV viewers so I can list it for radio listeners
[02:37:36.380 --> 02:37:38.820]  so they want to go see the video at Project Veritas website.
[02:37:38.820 --> 02:37:41.380]  We should probably repost this to Project Veritas.
[02:37:41.380 --> 02:37:44.980]  James O'Keeffe obtains Eminem's ballot.
[02:37:44.980 --> 02:37:45.980]  Now get ready.
[02:37:45.980 --> 02:37:49.260]  He's coming in to get Eminem's ballot where they have a record of it so he can go be Eminem.
[02:37:49.260 --> 02:37:52.980]  He's stealing his identity right here on television for you right now.
[02:37:52.980 --> 02:38:00.780]  He's at Eminem's polling station, Clemson Township.
[02:38:00.780 --> 02:38:13.140]  Hello, my name is Marshall Bruce Mathers.
[02:38:13.140 --> 02:38:18.300]  Okay, just have to fill out it first and then we'll need a picture right here.
[02:38:18.300 --> 02:38:19.300]  You know what?
[02:38:19.300 --> 02:38:20.300]  I don't have a driver's license with me.
[02:38:20.300 --> 02:38:21.300]  Do you have any other picture ideas?
[02:38:21.300 --> 02:38:22.300]  I don't.
[02:38:22.300 --> 02:38:26.300]  I left, I came from work and I don't have my wallet.
[02:38:26.300 --> 02:38:28.300]  But the name is Marshall Bruce Mathers.
[02:38:28.300 --> 02:38:29.300]  Okay.
[02:38:29.300 --> 02:38:30.300]  You can still fill it back again.
[02:38:30.300 --> 02:38:31.300]  Okay.
[02:38:31.300 --> 02:38:32.300]  Yeah.
[02:38:32.300 --> 02:38:33.300]  We stopped to fill this out.
[02:38:33.300 --> 02:38:34.300]  And now you'll sign in on it, man.
[02:38:34.300 --> 02:38:35.300]  You can still vote.
[02:38:35.300 --> 02:38:36.300]  So I can still vote?
[02:38:36.300 --> 02:38:37.300]  Yeah.
[02:38:37.300 --> 02:38:38.300]  You can still fill this out.
[02:38:38.300 --> 02:38:39.300]  All I gotta do is fill this out?
[02:38:39.300 --> 02:38:40.300]  Yeah.
[02:38:40.300 --> 02:38:41.300]  Let's try it.
[02:38:41.300 --> 02:38:42.300]  You can go into Travis County's area.
[02:38:42.300 --> 02:38:49.300]  Alex Jones, I can still vote.
[02:38:49.300 --> 02:38:52.300]  But I don't have a driver's license.
[02:38:52.300 --> 02:38:53.300]  That's all right.
[02:38:53.300 --> 02:38:55.300]  If you don't have it on you, then you're forming.
[02:38:55.300 --> 02:38:56.300]  Yeah.
[02:38:56.300 --> 02:38:57.300]  That's why you're signing this.
[02:38:57.300 --> 02:38:59.300]  And your driver's license is just the name you want.
[02:38:59.300 --> 02:39:02.300]  And you have to fill out your information with your name.
[02:39:02.300 --> 02:39:05.300]  So the middle name is Bruce and I have a suffix, the third.
[02:39:05.300 --> 02:39:09.300]  Or if that is the middle name, it's Marshall Bruce Mathers, the third.
[02:39:09.300 --> 02:39:12.300]  He'll find you, he'll find you in there.
[02:39:12.300 --> 02:39:13.300]  But you have to fill it out.
[02:39:13.300 --> 02:39:14.300]  Okay.
[02:39:14.300 --> 02:39:15.300]  You'll look it up.
[02:39:15.300 --> 02:39:16.300]  Yeah.
[02:39:16.300 --> 02:39:17.300]  All right.
[02:39:17.300 --> 02:39:19.300]  The last name is Mathers, M-A-T-H-E-R-S.
[02:39:19.300 --> 02:39:20.300]  The first name is Marshall.
[02:39:20.300 --> 02:39:21.300]  Yep.
[02:39:21.300 --> 02:39:22.300]  That's what it says.
[02:39:22.300 --> 02:39:24.300]  So you guys will let me vote.
[02:39:24.300 --> 02:39:27.300]  Marshall, Bruce, Mathers, all I gotta do is sign this thing here.
[02:39:27.300 --> 02:39:28.300]  Yeah.
[02:39:28.300 --> 02:39:29.300]  Fill both sides.
[02:39:29.300 --> 02:39:30.300]  Fill both things out.
[02:39:30.300 --> 02:39:35.300]  The birthday is October 17th, 1972.
[02:39:35.300 --> 02:39:36.300]  Yep.
[02:39:36.300 --> 02:39:38.300]  That's a great thing there.
[02:39:38.300 --> 02:39:39.300]  And you know, I was worried.
[02:39:39.300 --> 02:39:40.300]  I didn't have my ID.
[02:39:40.300 --> 02:39:41.300]  What's that?
[02:39:41.300 --> 02:39:42.300]  You have a really nice name.
[02:39:42.300 --> 02:39:43.300]  Oh.
[02:39:43.300 --> 02:39:46.300]  Are you related to a certain somebody named Marshall Mathers?
[02:39:46.300 --> 02:39:47.300]  Oh, everyone always says that.
[02:39:47.300 --> 02:39:48.300]  No.
[02:39:48.300 --> 02:39:50.300]  But you know, it's, I think that's a wrap.
[02:39:50.300 --> 02:39:51.300]  I don't even know he's under the number.
[02:39:51.300 --> 02:39:52.300]  Right?
[02:39:52.300 --> 02:39:53.300]  Yeah.
[02:39:53.300 --> 02:39:54.300]  Yeah.
[02:39:54.300 --> 02:39:55.300]  Yeah.
[02:39:55.300 --> 02:39:56.300]  He lives in the area.
[02:39:56.300 --> 02:39:57.300]  Well, that last call really asked for it.
[02:39:57.300 --> 02:39:58.300]  We're gonna hit him hard.
[02:39:58.300 --> 02:39:59.300]  Okay.
[02:39:59.300 --> 02:40:00.300]  You know, I just, I have a phone call.
[02:40:00.300 --> 02:40:01.300]  I'll be right back.
[02:40:01.300 --> 02:40:02.300]  Just give me one second.
[02:40:02.300 --> 02:40:03.300]  You should.
[02:40:03.300 --> 02:40:04.300]  Yeah.
[02:40:04.300 --> 02:40:05.300]  I'm voting right now.
[02:40:05.300 --> 02:40:06.300]  Yeah.
[02:40:06.300 --> 02:40:08.300]  I know.
[02:40:08.300 --> 02:40:09.300]  I know.
[02:40:09.300 --> 02:40:12.300]  I thought I needed an ID too.
[02:40:12.300 --> 02:40:14.300]  But they don't need it.
[02:40:14.300 --> 02:40:15.300]  All right.
[02:40:15.300 --> 02:40:17.300]  I got to go.
[02:40:17.300 --> 02:40:19.300]  That kills me.
[02:40:19.300 --> 02:40:20.300]  Hi.
[02:40:20.300 --> 02:40:21.300]  Hi.
[02:40:21.300 --> 02:40:22.300]  My name is Roy.
[02:40:22.300 --> 02:40:23.300]  My name is Paul.
[02:40:23.300 --> 02:40:24.300]  My name is Johnny.
[02:40:24.300 --> 02:40:25.300]  Johnny.
[02:40:25.300 --> 02:40:26.300]  Tell me, tell me.
[02:40:26.300 --> 02:40:27.300]  Tell me, show me your ID.
[02:40:27.300 --> 02:40:28.300]  Doesn't matter.
[02:40:28.300 --> 02:40:29.300]  So I walked into the school.
[02:40:29.300 --> 02:40:30.300]  All right.
[02:40:30.300 --> 02:40:31.300]  That's projectvert.com.
[02:40:31.300 --> 02:40:32.300]  Now, I'm gonna go back to your calls.
[02:40:32.300 --> 02:40:34.300]  I'm not gonna let that guy that was disagreeing,
[02:40:34.300 --> 02:40:38.520]  everything, but I mean that's what I mean, you're just slithering around lying, knowing
[02:40:38.520 --> 02:40:44.740]  he was lying. Just go to Google. You know they game a lot of this and just type in voter
[02:40:44.740 --> 02:40:52.100]  fraud or election fraud or engineered testifies on election fraud. I mean it's just, there's
[02:40:52.100 --> 02:40:59.100]  literally hundreds of news articles, hundreds of videos. Quite frankly, a few weeks ago I
[02:40:59.100 --> 02:41:02.780]  started pushing the initiative to expose all this as you've noticed nationally from talking
[02:41:02.780 --> 02:41:07.380]  about it as well. And I started watching the videos and reading the articles and I thought
[02:41:07.380 --> 02:41:12.780]  I knew all of it. There was so much stuff I couldn't even keep track of it. Bloomberg,
[02:41:12.780 --> 02:41:19.740]  how to hack an election. All the fraud in Latin America. I'll tell you this, at least you
[02:41:19.740 --> 02:41:24.260]  talk to the average Latin America and they, of course they're selection fraud. Only weirdo
[02:41:24.260 --> 02:41:32.660]  Democrats would sit there and deny it. Here's a little newsflash for you. Al Gore won the
[02:41:32.660 --> 02:41:44.060]  2000 election. Al Gore. I hate Al Gore, but there was fraud and Stone was the number two
[02:41:44.060 --> 02:41:50.380]  guy under James Baker running that recount. Number two. And he's apologized for it and
[02:41:50.380 --> 02:41:53.780]  said it was wrong and he's very ashamed of it. He changed course two years after with
[02:41:53.780 --> 02:41:59.180]  the Iraq war and went public. That's why I like Stone. He's a real deal. I should have
[02:41:59.180 --> 02:42:06.500]  Stone on to tell us by election fraud. I did in the first hour, but I mean, this is the
[02:42:06.500 --> 02:42:11.620]  type of crap I deal with all day long because they know they're lying, but it's like seeing
[02:42:11.620 --> 02:42:15.980]  in anchors. They get up there and they pretend and all convince themselves and then think
[02:42:15.980 --> 02:42:20.380]  because they call in and tell us the sky is at blue. And I love that tactic. Prove to
[02:42:20.380 --> 02:42:25.580]  me a blue will exist. Show me one now. I'm like, dude, election fraud and voter frauds.
[02:42:25.580 --> 02:42:29.100]  Well known. It's like saying, show me the blue sky. It's right above me, but I don't
[02:42:29.100 --> 02:42:34.860]  have to show it to you. It's like proof to me that Abraham Lincoln was the Republican
[02:42:34.860 --> 02:42:40.380]  president born in Illinois. Prove to me the civil war happened in Robert E. Lee existed.
[02:42:40.380 --> 02:42:43.820]  Prove to me there was ever a second amendment. Prove to me there was ever a first amendment.
[02:42:43.820 --> 02:42:48.620]  Prove to me. Prove to me. Alex. Yes. Yes, Matt. I wanted you to pop in. Go ahead.
[02:42:48.620 --> 02:42:51.980]  You said that, uh, you know, he must have been a Democrat because he doesn't believe
[02:42:51.980 --> 02:42:57.900]  in voter fraud, but I bet if Trump wins, all the Democrats are going to come out the woodwork
[02:42:57.900 --> 02:43:02.460]  just saying, Hey, it's had to have been election fraud, had to have been voter fraud.
[02:43:02.460 --> 02:43:06.620]  I agree. Uh, do we have any shortage of proof of election or voter fraud done, Matt? I mean,
[02:43:06.620 --> 02:43:14.700]  we could spend 10 hours on it. Arben has close to 20 videos of election fraud and that's
[02:43:14.700 --> 02:43:20.380]  in the past two months. What, what did you make of his call though?
[02:43:23.260 --> 02:43:28.620]  It's not the first time I haven't heard something like that. Um, I actually have gone back and forth
[02:43:28.620 --> 02:43:32.940]  with, um, one of my old roommates about election fraud and he actually kind of came at it from
[02:43:32.940 --> 02:43:38.140]  the same angle because it's not very widely reported on in the mainstream. And actually
[02:43:38.140 --> 02:43:42.700]  before I started, because they've made the law where you just walk in and take over somebody's
[02:43:42.700 --> 02:43:47.260]  identity and vote. Oh yeah. And you, you know, it was shocking for me once we started digging
[02:43:47.260 --> 02:43:52.060]  into it, just a little bit of searching on the internet will uncover all these instances
[02:43:52.060 --> 02:43:57.260]  where people are, are just going nuts. And the reason why I recommended that James O'Keefe
[02:43:57.260 --> 02:44:03.900]  video is just how blatant, how, how easy it is to go in and commit voter fraud. It's hilarious.
[02:44:05.660 --> 02:44:09.340]  Well, other points on this, I mean, I mean, do you like my idea of taking that call and then
[02:44:09.340 --> 02:44:13.180]  just chopping it full of news articles and video clips? Oh yeah. No, that, that right there would
[02:44:13.180 --> 02:44:18.060]  be, um, a powerful thing to share with everybody because there are people who don't believe it
[02:44:18.060 --> 02:44:22.460]  out there. That's kind of the sad truth. You know, people just don't believe because you know what,
[02:44:22.460 --> 02:44:27.420]  again, they're people who are good minded people. They wouldn't think to go do that. I agree those
[02:44:27.420 --> 02:44:33.100]  exist map, but with this guy, the Democrats are the kings of retail low level fraud. And so, and so
[02:44:33.100 --> 02:44:37.740]  they are always perennially every year, every election year, they run around and say it doesn't
[02:44:37.740 --> 02:44:43.660]  exist. You got to think like a criminal. That's the thing. Rachel Maddow wears purple glasses.
[02:44:43.660 --> 02:44:50.860]  Doesn't that mean she's smarter than us? She just, I can't help it. I, I love that sweater. I just
[02:44:50.860 --> 02:44:55.580]  want to snuggle up with her and drink a nice cup of blood. Listen, I'm not, I'm not normally gay,
[02:44:55.580 --> 02:45:00.380]  but I'm going to be honest. There's two people I'm gay for. There's two men I'm attracted to,
[02:45:00.380 --> 02:45:03.180]  and that is Donald Trump and Rachel Maddow. He's hot.
[02:45:03.180 --> 02:45:13.500]  What? Rachel, I want a date. Stop it. I can't stand up now. I'm joking on both. I'm joking on
[02:45:13.500 --> 02:45:18.540]  both obviously. Oh my gosh. I'm gay for Marilyn Monroe, but I mean, it's just too ridiculous.
[02:45:18.540 --> 02:45:24.940]  The big list of vote fraud reports, World Net Daily, 108% of voting population endorses Obama.
[02:45:24.940 --> 02:45:29.500]  Remember that one? That was a good one. Remember that one? How about 8 million more people voted
[02:45:29.500 --> 02:45:37.100]  in 2012, but Romney got less votes than John McCain did in 2008. Does anyone believe that? Do you
[02:45:37.100 --> 02:45:44.460]  believe that? Anybody else in the control room want to pop in? Matt, Zach, anybody else?
[02:45:49.420 --> 02:45:53.180]  I think we're good. How about Nico? Nico wants to pop in now. That means Nico doesn't want to
[02:45:53.180 --> 02:45:57.180]  come on air. The lead producer. We're going to make Nico Acusta come on here right now.
[02:45:57.180 --> 02:46:02.700]  This is CJ. I have a comment. The caller doesn't listen because if you recall, Texas primaries
[02:46:02.700 --> 02:46:09.260]  2016, we had over 12 people call local AM and claim that they had voted for Trump,
[02:46:09.260 --> 02:46:13.020]  got to review, and they had apparently voted for Rubio.
[02:46:14.300 --> 02:46:18.460]  Oh yeah, there's majors. They didn't want Texas to go for Trump. It's amazing. All right. Well,
[02:46:18.460 --> 02:46:24.380]  look, look, the caller's right. Okay. I'm going to tell you, caller, you're right. You devastated
[02:46:24.380 --> 02:46:32.460]  us through your intellectual prowess. I mean, brute force, 700 horsepower dominance. I'm like
[02:46:32.460 --> 02:46:37.020]  a lawnmower compared to your intellect. You crushed me. You're right. There's no voter fraud. There's
[02:46:37.020 --> 02:46:41.500]  no election fraud. I'm going to go home tonight and crawl in bed and I'm going to get my pillow
[02:46:41.500 --> 02:46:44.940]  and I'm going to get in a fetal position and I'm going to cry for my mommy.
[02:46:48.140 --> 02:46:51.900]  Then they'll send a social worker to your house. Oh, no. I mean, I'm joking. I'm not actually
[02:46:51.900 --> 02:46:56.860]  depressed. That was a joke. I'll never commit suicide. Hey, one last thing here about the
[02:46:56.860 --> 02:47:00.780]  election fraud and that is one thing that we haven't touched on in terms of the electronic
[02:47:00.780 --> 02:47:06.700]  forms of voter fraud. Yes. We don't talk about it enough, but it's waiting the votes.
[02:47:07.820 --> 02:47:14.700]  So you have 10 people vote each side, right? But the side that votes the way that people
[02:47:14.700 --> 02:47:21.100]  who are rigging against their votes are weighted to be seven eighths of a vote or one half. Yeah,
[02:47:21.100 --> 02:47:24.300]  they shave it. I mean, we've got hundreds of documentations for the engineers who've gone
[02:47:24.300 --> 02:47:27.260]  public and then died in a car wreck the next week or in an airplane accident or shot them
[02:47:27.260 --> 02:47:32.780]  back in the head. Exactly. And that's actually the more likely way that it happens. Exactly.
[02:47:32.780 --> 02:47:37.180]  Yeah, that electronic form where you've got a vote that is- And then there's no way to even
[02:47:37.180 --> 02:47:43.580]  track it because it was all a digital algorithm. Yeah. Yeah. And it would be much more feasible,
[02:47:43.580 --> 02:47:48.780]  much easier to get away with, right? Well, I mean, look, I don't believe there's any corruption
[02:47:48.780 --> 02:47:51.420]  going on by this government. I mean, they would never lie to us, even though they get caught
[02:47:51.420 --> 02:47:56.940]  every day doing it. All right. Good points there, Matt. Let's go to Dean and Tay Hosman
[02:47:56.940 --> 02:48:03.260]  holding a long time. Dean, welcome to the airwaves, sir. Hey, it's great to be on. I've seen you
[02:48:03.260 --> 02:48:08.860]  all the way back to the access days. What'd you make of that last caller saying that we're making
[02:48:08.860 --> 02:48:16.940]  stuff up? Well, it's such a- I used to work at Dell Computer. And when they all went to
[02:48:16.940 --> 02:48:24.940]  computerized methods of taking the vote, there were articles about that showing how
[02:48:24.940 --> 02:48:33.580]  unbelievably vulnerable those are to all kinds of abuse where you could get massive counts of
[02:48:33.580 --> 02:48:40.780]  votes in certain, let's say, counties or whatever that are responsible for doing the voting. I mean,
[02:48:40.780 --> 02:48:45.820]  they're unbelievably vulnerable. Canada, I read an article way back then about how they,
[02:48:45.820 --> 02:48:52.940]  you know, they count the votes on paper ballots and they have a witness from the sides of the
[02:48:52.940 --> 02:48:58.540]  opponents of the political process and they count them up and they complete the election
[02:48:58.540 --> 02:49:03.660]  in just a few hours or less. We should go back to paper ballots and then have them
[02:49:03.660 --> 02:49:11.740]  be stored for like five years under law. And the point is, is to have the witnesses on all opposing
[02:49:11.740 --> 02:49:18.300]  sides to watch. And those are real elections. Absolutely. That's exactly what we need. But
[02:49:18.300 --> 02:49:22.860]  the LBJ still cheated with that system and had one key county, more people voted than live in
[02:49:22.860 --> 02:49:26.460]  the county. And that's how he got it over. And then those ballots got burned, you know, that whole
[02:49:26.460 --> 02:49:32.060]  story. Yeah, you can go back and recount on it. It could be challenged and there's no
[02:49:33.500 --> 02:49:38.780]  gamesmanship. I mean, my God, with the hacking of Hillary Clinton and it's unbelievable. I mean,
[02:49:38.780 --> 02:49:43.900]  I have been hacked myself by a terrorist. I have too. I've had also, everybody's had
[02:49:43.900 --> 02:49:47.740]  their identity messed with and they're saying basically it exists for us individually, but
[02:49:47.740 --> 02:49:54.780]  not an election. Does that hold water, Dean? Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, I want to get on to a point
[02:49:54.780 --> 02:50:00.620]  about Brexit because that's mind blowing. It'll kind of blow everybody's mind when I get to that.
[02:50:00.620 --> 02:50:04.540]  But I wanted to get, because we're always limited on time. I don't know how much more you'll give
[02:50:04.540 --> 02:50:11.100]  me, but on the rigged trade versus fair trade, this is an idea I had and it's, and I wonder why
[02:50:11.100 --> 02:50:16.780]  it has never been caught on. I mean, I go all the way back. I was a pro supporter. I remember the
[02:50:16.780 --> 02:50:23.420]  debates on NAFTA. I'm a sort of a C-SPAN junkie. I mean, I've been able to vote since 76. So,
[02:50:23.420 --> 02:50:28.780]  you know, I've been following this stuff a long time, but he told us we were going to get rigged
[02:50:28.780 --> 02:50:34.140]  trade and that's exactly what we got. And we know Clinton supported NAFTA and it got voted in
[02:50:34.140 --> 02:50:39.660]  others that supported Hillary. So, let me hear how they only come back. But absolutely. We played
[02:50:39.660 --> 02:50:44.060]  it in the first hour. Have you missed it, folks? Maybe it was the second hour. Hillary saying that
[02:50:44.780 --> 02:50:49.420]  it was the first hour. Hillary saying that, you know, she loves the TPP and helped author it as
[02:50:49.420 --> 02:50:54.700]  the honcho of it as the gold standard. But now she says she never said that and she will never,
[02:50:54.700 --> 02:50:57.740]  never did support it, won't support it now and won't in the future.

[02:54:18.860 --> 02:54:22.700]  right. Even though he's not a talk show host, he did really great on air, but he's a famous editorial
[02:54:22.700 --> 02:54:27.660]  cartoonist, one of the most famous alive today who didn't used to really be kind of an anti-globalist
[02:54:27.660 --> 02:54:32.460]  at least trying to censor him. He's got a new one out weekend at Hillary's instead of weekend at
[02:54:32.460 --> 02:54:38.940]  Bernie's and it's got the Secret Service there with their tranquilizer dart and a keeper under
[02:54:38.940 --> 02:54:45.260]  control stronger together. I don't feel no ways tired and I always knew looking at Ben Garrison
[02:54:45.260 --> 02:54:48.780]  cartoons that a lot of them were influenced by the show and that one certainly is, so I'm very,
[02:54:48.780 --> 02:54:53.420]  very honored. I want to get him back on the broadcast, but there's another James O'Keefe
[02:54:53.980 --> 02:54:59.180]  video where he goes in and votes as the most famous writer in the town for the newspaper
[02:54:59.180 --> 02:55:03.180]  and they let him vote because you got the name baby, we don't need driver's license
[02:55:03.180 --> 02:55:10.700]  and these Democrat run states and it's just hilarious to go fly on an airplane and watch
[02:55:10.700 --> 02:55:16.140]  illegals, not even have IDs and be allowed to fly. I'm not against them, but I'm being screwed over.
[02:55:17.340 --> 02:55:24.140]  I don't want to be discriminated against and it's a joke and Hillary isn't so much trouble.
[02:55:24.140 --> 02:55:28.780]  I'll be back this Sunday, four to six p.m. central. I always say Lord willing because you know,
[02:55:28.780 --> 02:55:33.980]  I don't cross my fingers, knock on wood and thank everybody for their prayers and the lucky stars,
[02:55:34.780 --> 02:55:39.660]  but a lot is going on in this world right now. This is a wild time and obviously you see me
[02:55:39.660 --> 02:55:45.020]  filing reports on Saturday and Sundays now on top of the Sunday show because I've even put the studio
[02:55:45.020 --> 02:55:48.620]  in at my house where I'm just going to start randomly just going live on all our platforms
[02:55:48.620 --> 02:55:54.300]  wherever I want and then they're setting it up for somebody who's not new technical like myself.
[02:55:54.300 --> 02:55:58.140]  I'm actually very technical that I take time to figure stuff out, but I'm too busy where I'm just
[02:55:58.140 --> 02:56:03.740]  going to hit like one red button and I'm live on air video cameras, you name it. So be looking for
[02:56:03.740 --> 02:56:09.980]  that, talk about reality TV. We're actually talking about mountain cameras in certain offices of this
[02:56:09.980 --> 02:56:14.460]  company. So when we go in those offices, we hit live and folks see the behind the scenes war game
[02:56:15.420 --> 02:56:17.740]  because that's where the really interesting stuff goes on around here.
[02:56:18.780 --> 02:56:21.980]  Sometimes we'll have like a button we hit to shut down info if it's a source or something,
[02:56:21.980 --> 02:56:26.460]  but I mean it's just I want folks to know what's going on at info wars really takes to the next
[02:56:26.460 --> 02:56:30.700]  level because real reality TV is fake. So we're going to have the real, real reality TV.
[02:56:31.420 --> 02:56:35.900]  Dean in Texas, go ahead and make your point about the Brexit and about trade and all these deals.
[02:56:37.420 --> 02:56:41.740]  Thanks Alex for giving me the time on this. I think it's just it's the most critical thing
[02:56:41.740 --> 02:56:45.500]  in the world right now for everybody. I understand you got two and a half minutes.
[02:56:45.500 --> 02:56:51.340]  No more preface. Go ahead. Okay. Okay. All right. So anyway, we've been running these huge hundreds
[02:56:51.340 --> 02:56:57.580]  of billions of dollar deficits with NAFTA and then also with China and these, these trade deals have
[02:56:57.580 --> 02:57:05.180]  been rigged for foreign government's benefits and they've become vastly wealthy and we've been
[02:57:05.180 --> 02:57:10.860]  depleted whole communities, cities, regions of the United States. And this doesn't just involve
[02:57:10.860 --> 02:57:17.980]  the rust belt. This involves high tech companies like Microsoft, Dell or Time Warner cable. This
[02:57:17.980 --> 02:57:24.060]  is how they conquer us. They sell us out the foreign interest. Yeah. They sent those, those tech
[02:57:24.060 --> 02:57:29.260]  support things over to India. You get terrible connections on the phone. They barely speak
[02:57:29.260 --> 02:57:35.980]  English. So this goes beyond just, you know, factory work. It is technical knowledge work too
[02:57:35.980 --> 02:57:41.500]  that's been exported away. And here's, here's why it's rigged and why it's just been really like
[02:57:41.500 --> 02:57:46.540]  a crime to the American people. And this is where Trump hits the nail on the head on it.
[02:57:46.540 --> 02:57:53.100]  All we ever had to do with every trade deal was put in there that we would have a running average
[02:57:53.100 --> 02:57:59.580]  between the trade deficits and the trade surpluses between our countries that we had the trade deals
[02:57:59.580 --> 02:58:03.820]  with and then this running and then that's when the tariff kicks in when they start screwing us.
[02:58:03.820 --> 02:58:11.900]  Absolutely. Either that or have it more pro growth where they buy what our deficit is. So when we
[02:58:11.900 --> 02:58:16.620]  run the billions in let's say in five years, they have to buy our bonds, which gives them
[02:58:16.620 --> 02:58:21.420]  mistaken us and us and them. That's real globalism. That's how they sold globalism, but they never
[02:58:21.420 --> 02:58:26.620]  did that. Were they, were they buy our goods, you know, so that the man. No, no, that's how
[02:58:26.620 --> 02:58:30.140]  they sold globalism to build up the world. That's how they got all the liberals on board
[02:58:30.140 --> 02:58:33.740]  in the fifties for the world government plan bigger than the Manhattan project. You just hit
[02:58:33.740 --> 02:58:37.100]  the nail on the head. That was actually their plan, brother. You just thought of it on your own.
[02:58:37.100 --> 02:58:42.220]  They just never implemented that. They did it as a one-sided deal to transfer power to these
[02:58:42.940 --> 02:58:46.380]  third world cesspools so they could control everybody. We'll be back. Stay with us.
[02:58:49.420 --> 02:58:52.940]  It's not just our water we need to filter. It's not just our food that needs to be
[02:58:52.940 --> 02:58:58.140]  cleaned. It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children. The artificial particulates,
[02:58:58.140 --> 02:59:04.060]  the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems. The same team based right here
[02:59:04.060 --> 02:59:09.020]  in America that brought you the Alexa pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have
[02:59:09.020 --> 02:59:13.980]  now developed Alexa pure breeze. Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself,
[02:59:13.980 --> 02:59:19.020]  your coworkers, your family, your children to the best job you can to purify your air.
[02:59:19.020 --> 02:59:23.340]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things
[02:59:23.340 --> 02:59:28.140]  that mitigate or avoid most toxic effects for themselves. The general public doesn't.
[02:59:28.140 --> 02:59:35.500]  The Alexa pure breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500. One of these systems can keep 800 square
[02:59:35.500 --> 02:59:39.420]  feet incredibly clean. This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house,
[02:59:39.420 --> 02:59:45.260]  replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job. Find out why this system is so
[02:59:45.260 --> 02:59:47.740]  revolutionary today and then fullwarstore.com.
[02:59:47.740 --> 02:59:54.700]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:59:54.700 --> 03:00:19.020]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[03:00:19.020 --> 03:00:26.620]  Well, you want to see the front men they've got. New York Times article, Fox news names,
[03:00:26.620 --> 03:00:33.660]  two insiders to top post. But it's really running the show now is the Democratic Party
[03:00:33.660 --> 03:00:40.620]  and Hillary Clinton. They're given the marching orders and Bill Shine and Jack Abernathy load
[03:00:40.620 --> 03:00:52.380]  the teleprompters. And their job is to slowly strangle news core in its crib. I want to go back
[03:00:52.380 --> 03:00:58.300]  to your phone calls. And then in the next segment, I'm going to play a little piece. I'm told there's
[03:00:58.300 --> 03:01:01.900]  hours of this, but where I was talking about Hillary being the founder of ISIS, Hillary being
[03:01:01.900 --> 03:01:05.100]  the commander of ISIS, and then Trump saying, and we'll play a few of those clips and hand the
[03:01:05.100 --> 03:01:09.580]  baton to David Knight, who's in the other studio. Right now, let's go to Doug in Arizona. Doug,
[03:01:09.580 --> 03:01:15.900]  thanks for calling. Hey, Alex. I've got two talking points. I hope I can catch them both as
[03:01:15.900 --> 03:01:22.300]  quickly as possible. I will get them out. The first one is you wrote a story about mainstream
[03:01:22.300 --> 03:01:28.220]  media saying the elections were regained. First time I've heard this too. You remember you did
[03:01:28.220 --> 03:01:34.220]  this just a little while ago, right? Trying to understand you when we've run tens of thousands
[03:01:34.220 --> 03:01:40.620]  of stories a year. But I mean, I've, I did run a story with CBS admitting that there's election
[03:01:40.620 --> 03:01:46.620]  fraud. We said, good job, CBS. You're talking about the first hour today? And I had an epiphany
[03:01:46.620 --> 03:01:51.820]  after that. I said, Hey, this is like a 180. Why are they going in this direction? What's the
[03:01:51.820 --> 03:01:57.980]  true meaning behind it? And I think if Trump wins the election, then they can say it was rigged
[03:01:57.980 --> 03:02:04.140]  and possibly causing the cause enough scandal to postpone the elections and then Obama can stay
[03:02:04.140 --> 03:02:09.020]  in power. Sure. Well, I don't say that I think Trump's really winning just because I want to
[03:02:09.020 --> 03:02:13.980]  say that. I mean, they changed the methodology. He was 10 to 14 points ahead. Suddenly he's
[03:02:13.980 --> 03:02:19.020]  that far behind. They changed the methodology. They're rigging everything else. They admit
[03:02:19.020 --> 03:02:23.580]  they're rigging everything. I can't find Hillary supporters. I mean, it's like finding unicorns.
[03:02:23.580 --> 03:02:30.380]  And so I'm just saying, I really think there's a closeted grip going for Trump 10 points or so.
[03:02:30.940 --> 03:02:35.580]  And so I think he's going to win big time. Stone thinks he's going to win by a very narrow margin.
[03:02:36.780 --> 03:02:40.140]  I don't know. I mean, we're going to find out. All I know is this is a wild time to be alive.
[03:02:40.140 --> 03:02:44.700]  I mean, I'm so excited. I'm exhausted. I mean, I just, man, I tell you, this is just, this is a
[03:02:44.700 --> 03:02:51.500]  nail biter. If he wins too big, though, this is where that scenario of election fraud can come in
[03:02:51.500 --> 03:02:55.980]  and using it in their spin and their favor. Anyway, so that was the first talking point.
[03:02:56.620 --> 03:03:03.980]  Second talking point is, I think we need to take a better look at Tim Cain. Let's say Hillary does
[03:03:03.980 --> 03:03:10.060]  make it. I mean, come on, she's a corpse. She might make it six months. She's a fact. They're
[03:03:10.060 --> 03:03:16.700]  going to sacrifice the queen for the new King Cain. That's, that's why he's there. Well, I'll
[03:03:16.700 --> 03:03:22.220]  say this. I mean, Cain's a globalist, Cain's a, I've looked at his record as he's better than
[03:03:22.220 --> 03:03:28.060]  Hillary. I mean, he's, he claims he's pro, you know, live, but then stands down. That's better
[03:03:28.060 --> 03:03:33.100]  than me and openly, you know, pushing it like it's great. He's been quasi, you know, he's bad. He's
[03:03:33.100 --> 03:03:40.380]  just, he's like a rabbit dog. She's like a rabbit hyena. Well, you know, he's, he went to an all
[03:03:40.380 --> 03:03:47.340]  boys Jesuit prep school. He's been on Jesuit missionaries, he's a Harvard law graduate. Well,
[03:03:47.340 --> 03:03:51.020]  that's not good because, you know, the Jesuits are making their move. Hell, they took over the
[03:03:51.020 --> 03:03:57.500]  Catholic church and they've got that new pope. That's just crazy. I've always stayed on a Catholic
[03:03:57.500 --> 03:04:01.500]  bashing. As Catholics, I metered great people on the ground, but man, this new pope's like,
[03:04:01.500 --> 03:04:06.060]  it's like having Moussey tongue as the pope. I mean, how, how much crazier is this going to get?
[03:04:06.060 --> 03:04:13.900]  What do you think, Doug? I didn't, I didn't catch you. What was that out? I mean, how
[03:04:13.900 --> 03:04:22.300]  bad's it going to get with his pope? That's another whole story that's going to play out.
[03:04:22.300 --> 03:04:27.420]  Well, let me ask you this. I mean, are you running into any Hillary supporters in Arizona?
[03:04:27.420 --> 03:04:30.780]  Because I hear he's going to lose Arizona. That's the biggest load of belonging I've ever heard.
[03:04:30.780 --> 03:04:37.660]  You know, I hate to say it, but it seems like most of the Hillary supporters are the elderly.
[03:04:39.900 --> 03:04:44.380]  Yeah, that's it. They just think she's going to give them a bigger sugar tit. All right,
[03:04:44.380 --> 03:04:49.580]  good to hear from you, Doug. We're going to talk to Bob, Terry, Debbie, Daniel, and others. Finish
[03:04:49.580 --> 03:05:02.060]  up with this clip and a lot more. David Knight's going to come in as a fresh horse. Stay with us.
[03:05:19.900 --> 03:05:25.500]  of the media, a three hour glimpse at his medical records after intense speculation put him under
[03:05:25.500 --> 03:05:30.460]  pressure to prove to the public that he was physically fit for office because he would have
[03:05:30.460 --> 03:05:36.700]  been the oldest president ever. McCain had already released 1500 pages of medical records back in
[03:05:36.700 --> 03:05:43.500]  1999. However, despite Hillary being just two years younger than McCain was in 2008, CNN reported
[03:05:43.500 --> 03:05:48.460]  that those demanding the release of Clinton's health history in 2016 were being conspiratorial.
[03:05:48.460 --> 03:05:52.780]  The network also bashed Matt Drudge for posting photos of Clinton being helped
[03:05:52.780 --> 03:05:59.340]  up steps during a campaign stop in South Carolina. This has been Joe Viggs with info wars.com.

[03:06:15.420 --> 03:06:21.820]  process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres. Telomeres are the

[03:08:56.780 --> 03:08:58.780]  I mean, it's not rocket science.
[03:09:02.220 --> 03:09:06.140]  I am burning inside when it comes to fighting these people. David Knight's taken over. He's got

[03:09:12.220 --> 03:09:20.940]  Times admits it. Private property is in deep trouble. Immigration responses to what's happened
[03:09:20.940 --> 03:09:26.300]  with immigration. Voters won't believe it if Hillary wins. We've got so much coming up with David Knight.
[03:09:26.300 --> 03:09:30.940]  I've got a short compilation clip of where I'm talking about three years ago, two years ago,
[03:09:30.940 --> 03:09:37.020]  a year ago, Hillary being the commander of ISIS, the founder of ISIS. People really picked up on
[03:09:37.020 --> 03:09:41.340]  this. What is it like? You say something and Trump starts saying it. Well, yeah, we are one of the
[03:09:41.340 --> 03:09:47.420]  research places that Trump goes to. But the media go, oh, see the kooky thing that Hillary found
[03:09:47.420 --> 03:09:52.380]  that ISIS comes from Jones. No, it came from all the Pentagon sources in general Flynn through
[03:09:52.380 --> 03:09:59.820]  Colonel Schaefer and others one week after Benghazi. So you go pretend you're a journalist and all the
[03:09:59.820 --> 03:10:04.700]  rest of it. Okay. And you go play in a little sandbox over there. We'll be in the big boy area,
[03:10:04.700 --> 03:10:11.020]  the big girl area. Someday you'll be in the short pants. It's one day the big long pants. But
[03:10:11.020 --> 03:10:14.220]  I mean, it's just a joke. You people are a joke. Okay. You're a joke.
[03:10:17.180 --> 03:10:20.140]  You think as you go to some big glitzy building and they got a teleprompter for you that
[03:10:21.020 --> 03:10:23.980]  you've arrived, you're a joke. You have no honor.
[03:10:26.380 --> 03:10:29.340]  But before I go to that clip, there's a clip we haven't played yet. And some people said,
[03:10:29.340 --> 03:10:33.180]  why are there, why is Roger showing one guy flipping off CNN going FU on the Patriot? You're
[03:10:33.180 --> 03:10:38.220]  a traitor. Well, that's a message from Drudge. This is how I feel to CNN FU. I haven't talked to
[03:10:38.220 --> 03:10:43.340]  Drudge, but I'm telling you, Drudge is saying we should be done putting up with the communist news
[03:10:43.340 --> 03:10:48.780]  network, the Clinton news network, spewing this info. Don't play along with them. I don't even go
[03:10:48.780 --> 03:10:53.420]  on CNN when they call me. They don't even call me anymore. I have one question. Is it live?
[03:10:54.140 --> 03:10:57.900]  And then they lie and go, yes, it's live. Then like 10 minutes before I get to the satellite
[03:10:57.900 --> 03:11:01.340]  place, they'll go, actually it's taped now, Mr. Jones. So now I don't even call them back.
[03:11:01.340 --> 03:11:08.460]  I'm like, you don't want to go on CNN. You don't want to go on it. No, I don't want to
[03:11:08.460 --> 03:11:12.780]  go on you. It's like Fox when they had some quote, executive affairs ago, go,
[03:11:12.780 --> 03:11:17.740]  Jones tried to get a show at Fox, but failed. He wants show business, but show business doesn't
[03:11:17.740 --> 03:11:24.140]  want him. And I'm like, what liars? I've turned down multiple show offers from you jackasses.
[03:11:24.940 --> 03:11:28.940]  Man called Muller's witnessed it and couldn't believe it one time. It was another show I was
[03:11:28.940 --> 03:11:33.420]  offered. I even had him like, I'm like, okay, I want first class every time I fly to New York.
[03:11:33.420 --> 03:11:36.780]  And I want a first class hotel. We don't get that to anybody. Oh, I'm not doing it.
[03:11:36.780 --> 03:11:39.420]  Okay, we'll give you that. They were getting madder and madder.
[03:11:40.460 --> 03:11:44.220]  And it's not that I even want first class. I'm pissing on them. You understand that?
[03:11:45.260 --> 03:11:51.340]  Before I say no. But now I don't even play games with them now. Okay. Because it's my religion
[03:11:51.340 --> 03:11:55.500]  to let them know they're nobodies. They want us to think we're nobodies. No, they're nobodies.
[03:11:55.500 --> 03:12:00.060]  They're the bullies. They're the trash. We've got this whole Fox News situation where they're
[03:12:00.060 --> 03:12:05.900]  installing all these people closer to Hillary that'll do whatever Murdoch and his sons want.
[03:12:07.020 --> 03:12:10.220]  That's being announced. So you can already see it. I mean, they are
[03:12:11.100 --> 03:12:15.660]  turning Fox News off, but slowly kind of like the Hal 9,000 and Space Odyssey.
[03:12:17.420 --> 03:12:20.140]  Captain, that's not needed for you to do. Why don't you just relax?
[03:12:20.140 --> 03:12:26.300]  Now, those are my main centers, please. Let's discuss this, please. Now, in an hour later,
[03:12:26.300 --> 03:12:37.020]  oh, I am a Hal 9,000 created in Chicago, Illinois. Dr. Sussins such my first teacher taught me this
[03:12:37.020 --> 03:12:53.580]  song. Daisy, Daisy, give me your I'm afraid Dave. I'm afraid. They wake a billion dollars a year
[03:12:53.580 --> 03:12:57.660]  off of it. That's nothing to the hundreds of millions news corps makes. And they're going to
[03:12:57.660 --> 03:13:02.940]  get a big juicy slice of all the other state sponsored propaganda pie. 10s of billions of
[03:13:02.940 --> 03:13:07.260]  years already given the news corps. The big dirty secret we're going to be revealing very soon
[03:13:07.260 --> 03:13:17.420]  of government taxpayer money. So what does this signify?
[03:13:19.260 --> 03:13:23.020]  It's time to tell the mainstream media go straight to hell. Here's the clip.
[03:13:23.020 --> 03:13:31.500]  That was very good.
[03:13:31.500 --> 03:13:40.780]  Okay,
[03:13:44.780 --> 03:13:45.180]  say your compliment.
[03:13:45.180 --> 03:14:11.660]  You can tell that guy's from some third world tyranny or Eastern Europe or something, he's
[03:14:11.660 --> 03:14:15.820]  freaking pissed, he understands how this country's gonna go straight to hell now.
[03:14:15.820 --> 03:14:25.180]  So you should take it personal too, we're in a death battle people, alright let's go
[03:14:25.180 --> 03:14:30.260]  ahead and play this clip of who the real founder of ISIS is and I love how it clicked
[03:14:30.260 --> 03:14:34.980]  this morning because McBrain's like is this the clip you're looking for where you said
[03:14:34.980 --> 03:14:39.300]  she's the commander of it or the founder of it, we found plenty of me saying she's the
[03:14:39.300 --> 03:14:42.020]  commander of the leader, I've said she's the founder, we finally are finding some of those
[03:14:42.020 --> 03:14:51.580]  but there's a show folks, a show of the power you can have as well, taking action and McBrain's
[03:14:51.580 --> 03:14:52.580]  like is this it?
[03:14:52.580 --> 03:14:56.660]  He's planned one where I'd forgotten Hillary a year and a half ago with Soros said he's
[03:14:56.660 --> 03:15:01.940]  the number one recruiting sergeant, he's the leader of ISIS because they knew Trump was
[03:15:01.940 --> 03:15:05.020]  gonna go with that later.
[03:15:05.020 --> 03:15:09.220]  So it's okay when she says he's the founder of it or the commander of it or the recruiter
[03:15:09.220 --> 03:15:13.580]  for it because there's no reality in that, though that was perfectly fine but when he
[03:15:13.580 --> 03:15:17.460]  does it because it's true, then it's the end of the world, let's go ahead and play those
[03:15:17.460 --> 03:15:18.460]  clips.
[03:15:18.460 --> 03:15:23.580]  They blew up all the infrastructure, turned Al Qaeda loose to run around murdering everybody,
[03:15:23.580 --> 03:15:28.580]  now Al Qaeda has spilt all the way into Central Africa, all the way into Western Africa and
[03:15:28.580 --> 03:15:33.900]  is just running around murdering everyone, all run by Hillary Clinton.
[03:15:33.900 --> 03:15:37.420]  He let ISIS take this position.
[03:15:37.420 --> 03:15:43.580]  It was Hillary Clinton that she should get an award from them as the founder of ISIS.
[03:15:43.580 --> 03:15:44.580]  That's what it was.
[03:15:44.580 --> 03:15:49.580]  Oh, oh ABC's cut out right there and they are now moving forward, rolling forward with
[03:15:49.580 --> 03:15:50.580]  massive censorship.
[03:15:50.580 --> 03:15:57.500]  She gets up there, she says, you know ISIS is using Donald Trump videos to recruit.
[03:15:57.500 --> 03:16:00.380]  He is becoming ISIS's best recruiter.
[03:16:00.380 --> 03:16:04.540]  I mean you heard the CIA whistleblowers like Tosh Plumlee, you had to retire when he came
[03:16:04.540 --> 03:16:09.860]  on the show, you heard them all say that she's running through the State Department of Program
[03:16:09.860 --> 03:16:15.060]  with billions of dollars back to her foundation to send money out to all these different groups
[03:16:15.060 --> 03:16:17.220]  and the money just comes right back to her.
[03:16:17.220 --> 03:16:20.740]  They give them the weapons, they send her money back but because the other agencies
[03:16:20.740 --> 03:16:26.460]  wouldn't go along with it, they had to kill the people at that base and kill the ambassador
[03:16:26.460 --> 03:16:28.340]  to cover it up.
[03:16:28.340 --> 03:16:33.020]  ISIS is honoring President Obama.
[03:16:33.020 --> 03:16:37.180]  He is the founder of ISIS, he's the founder of ISIS.
[03:16:37.180 --> 03:16:41.500]  When the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, we had this brilliant idea that we were going
[03:16:41.500 --> 03:16:47.500]  to come to Pakistan and create a force of Mujahideen, equip them with stinger missiles
[03:16:47.500 --> 03:16:53.020]  and everything else to go after the Soviets inside Afghanistan and we were successful.
[03:16:53.020 --> 03:16:59.140]  I would say the co-founder would be Crooked Hillary Clinton.
[03:16:59.140 --> 03:17:03.060]  This can't really be happening that Hillary Clinton's probably going to be our next president
[03:17:03.060 --> 03:17:10.820]  when she's such a criminal gangster, so evil, such a fraud and armed al-Qaeda and ran the
[03:17:10.820 --> 03:17:13.740]  whole strategy to destabilize Africa and the Middle East.
[03:17:13.740 --> 03:17:18.740]  The people we are fighting today, we funded 20 years ago.
[03:17:18.740 --> 03:17:24.820]  What's crazy is she goes back to the fact that Jimmy Carter and Reagan did that before
[03:17:24.820 --> 03:17:26.660]  they knew about any of the blowback or any of this.
[03:17:26.660 --> 03:17:32.060]  It's been since Clinton, right through to now with Bush and her, radicalizing it with
[03:17:32.060 --> 03:17:33.980]  Saudi Arabia in this new deal.
[03:17:33.980 --> 03:17:38.820]  I'm not defending what Reagan or others did, the point is that he always gets the blame
[03:17:38.820 --> 03:17:42.740]  when really it was a big presence, he had a larger plan and wrote a book about it called
[03:17:42.740 --> 03:17:44.580]  the Grand Chess Board, which I've read three times.
[03:17:44.580 --> 03:17:49.060]  And I'd have these again pseudo debates with idiots that don't read books by Zbigniew
[03:17:49.060 --> 03:17:50.060]  Brzezinski.
[03:17:50.060 --> 03:17:52.700]  And I'm not up here on some pedestal, but if you want to debate me, did you really take
[03:17:52.700 --> 03:17:57.460]  the chronic error between two ages, tragedy and hope, the Anglo-American establishment?
[03:17:57.460 --> 03:18:03.380]  Some of those are books written by a fellow that wrote, a girl quickly, a fellow that
[03:18:03.380 --> 03:18:06.300]  wrote tragedy and hope and other key books.
[03:18:06.300 --> 03:18:11.740]  I mean, I know their mindset, I know who they are and you don't.
[03:18:11.740 --> 03:18:15.140]  But now Hillary's taken that same strategy and done this and turned them loose all over
[03:18:15.140 --> 03:18:17.220]  and then they brought 5 million into Europe.
[03:18:17.220 --> 03:18:18.220]  What is that for?
[03:18:18.220 --> 03:18:19.220]  To hold Europe hostage.
[03:18:19.220 --> 03:18:22.140]  All right, we're going to throw this to break.
[03:18:22.140 --> 03:18:23.140]  Come back with David Knight.
[03:18:23.140 --> 03:18:25.620]  Briefly, I didn't even plug last hour.
[03:18:25.620 --> 03:18:29.620]  If you want to see more reporters, you want to see more writers, you want to see us even
[03:18:29.620 --> 03:18:35.700]  more effective in putting out the true narrative and defeating the globalist and quite frankly,
[03:18:35.700 --> 03:18:37.860]  risking our lives in a very exciting way.
[03:18:37.860 --> 03:18:39.260]  I just love it quite frankly.
[03:18:39.260 --> 03:18:42.780]  Well, I'm exhausted and stuff, I think about how dangerous this is and that's what I actually
[03:18:42.780 --> 03:18:43.780]  feel good about it.
[03:18:43.780 --> 03:18:47.580]  People say, God, you got courage, which you scared, I'm like, hey man, it's how epic
[03:18:47.580 --> 03:18:48.780]  this is that gives me the energy.
[03:18:48.780 --> 03:18:49.780]  No, I'm not scared.
[03:18:49.780 --> 03:18:51.420]  I'm scared they're going to win.
[03:18:51.420 --> 03:18:58.180]  I'm not scared about me and then I'm telling you folks, we've got 50% off colloidal silver

[03:22:58.700 --> 03:23:03.660]  To a professional trader in precious metals, the key is spot price.
[03:23:03.660 --> 03:23:05.380]  Spot price is market price.
[03:23:05.380 --> 03:23:08.980]  What gold or silver actually costs on the exchange?
[03:23:08.980 --> 03:23:13.420]  Regular people looking to invest never get spot price because resellers add fees for
[03:23:13.420 --> 03:23:14.420]  everything.
[03:23:14.420 --> 03:23:17.540]  Refining, minting, brokerage costs, commissions.

[03:24:02.940 --> 03:24:11.620]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:11.620 --> 03:24:17.420]  I'm David Knight, your host in this fourth hour on this Friday, August 12, 2016.
[03:24:17.420 --> 03:24:19.940]  I'm going to pick up where Alex left off.
[03:24:19.940 --> 03:24:25.860]  He ran that clip talking about, yeah, Hillary Clinton and Obama really are the founders
[03:24:25.860 --> 03:24:26.860]  of ISIS.
[03:24:26.860 --> 03:24:27.860]  You have to understand that.
[03:24:27.860 --> 03:24:33.580]  I just find it absolutely amazing that we now see CNN and other outlets coming out and
[03:24:33.580 --> 03:24:36.780]  saying, Hillary doesn't want to control the guns.
[03:24:36.780 --> 03:24:41.020]  We didn't have anything to do with the creation of ISIS, the training or equipping of ISIS
[03:24:41.020 --> 03:24:46.100]  at the same time, at the same time that the New York Times, this is going back to August
[03:24:46.100 --> 03:24:47.100]  6.
[03:24:47.100 --> 03:24:50.220]  So this is essentially, this is a lesson a week ago.
[03:24:50.220 --> 03:24:56.260]  New York Times said, military success in Syria gives Putin the upper hand in the U.S. proxy
[03:24:56.260 --> 03:24:57.260]  war.
[03:24:57.260 --> 03:25:01.380]  Can I just report on this, the beginning of the week on the nightly news?
[03:25:01.380 --> 03:25:04.300]  They're calling it a proxy war.
[03:25:04.300 --> 03:25:11.220]  They're saying Russia is beating America and Syria in a proxy war.
[03:25:11.220 --> 03:25:12.940]  Okay, so who's on the two sides?
[03:25:12.940 --> 03:25:13.940]  Who are the players?
[03:25:13.940 --> 03:25:14.940]  Who's our proxy?
[03:25:14.940 --> 03:25:19.580]  Well, on the Russian side, the proxy is Syria and Assad, okay?
[03:25:19.580 --> 03:25:20.860]  Who is on our side?
[03:25:20.860 --> 03:25:27.300]  The New York Times says it's al-Qaeda, ISIS, al-Nusra, the rebels.
[03:25:27.300 --> 03:25:29.020]  Let me read you a little bit of this.
[03:25:29.020 --> 03:25:32.380]  The Syrian military, they said, was floundering last year.
[03:25:32.380 --> 03:25:38.100]  The rebel offensive was aided by powerful tank-destroying missiles supplied by the CIA
[03:25:38.100 --> 03:25:40.100]  and Saudi Arabia.
[03:25:40.100 --> 03:25:45.780]  But then the Russians arrived, and they bludgeoned CIA-backed rebel forces for the first time
[03:25:45.780 --> 03:25:48.220]  since Afghanistan in the 1980s, okay?
[03:25:48.220 --> 03:25:53.660]  And that would be, as Alex just pointed out, what Zbigniew Brzezinski and Jimmy Carter,
[03:25:53.660 --> 03:25:59.700]  his assistant to Jimmy Carter, created with a Mujahideen to go after the Russians in Afghanistan.
[03:25:59.700 --> 03:26:03.980]  And then we continued that under Reagan because, you know, the foreign policy of the elites
[03:26:03.980 --> 03:26:08.620]  at the top, the globalist warmongers, are the same, whether it's Republican or Democrat.
[03:26:08.620 --> 03:26:09.620]  It really doesn't matter.
[03:26:09.620 --> 03:26:11.700]  That's why they hate Donald Trump so much.
[03:26:11.700 --> 03:26:18.460]  And that's why you've got these 50 globalist spooks signing a letter saying that Donald
[03:26:18.460 --> 03:26:23.540]  Trump isn't fit to be president, okay, why?
[03:26:23.540 --> 03:26:28.020]  Because he is openly saying the stuff that they don't want you to know.
[03:26:28.020 --> 03:26:33.460]  He's exposing their lies, their corruption, their chaos, their being on both sides of
[03:26:33.460 --> 03:26:38.620]  most conflicts, but especially being on the side of the terrorists and telling us that
[03:26:38.620 --> 03:26:42.700]  they're going to protect us from the terrorists, both abroad and domestically.
[03:26:42.700 --> 03:26:46.980]  They create the threat, and then they have their solution, which is more government,
[03:26:46.980 --> 03:26:52.620]  more military, more police, more force directed at us, not at them, okay?
[03:26:52.620 --> 03:26:54.060]  They're telling you that they're fighting ISIS.
[03:26:54.060 --> 03:26:55.380]  They're not fighting ISIS.
[03:26:55.380 --> 03:27:00.980]  The New York Times is telling you at the same time, this is a proxy war that we're losing,
[03:27:00.980 --> 03:27:03.100]  and the people on our side are ISIS.
[03:27:03.100 --> 03:27:08.380]  They go on to say, they've been, we've now, for the first time since the 1980s, a Russian
[03:27:08.380 --> 03:27:15.780]  military for the past year, has been in direct combat with rebel forces trained and supplied
[03:27:15.780 --> 03:27:19.060]  by the CIA, okay?
[03:27:19.060 --> 03:27:23.220]  That's that conspiracy theory website, The New York Times, that liberals think is the
[03:27:23.220 --> 03:27:24.500]  paper of record.
[03:27:24.500 --> 03:27:29.860]  If you think that is the paper of record, then listen to them, because they have recorded
[03:27:29.860 --> 03:27:34.100]  what's going on, and they're telling you, they'll tell you on a Saturday or whatever
[03:27:34.100 --> 03:27:38.100]  what's going on, but then throughout the week, they pretend it doesn't exist, just like CNN
[03:27:38.100 --> 03:27:43.020]  wants to pretend that Hillary Clinton has never said anything about taking your guns,
[03:27:43.020 --> 03:27:44.020]  okay?
[03:27:44.020 --> 03:27:50.740]  CNN says that you've got the Washington Post writing an op-ed post saying, Hillary Clinton's
[03:27:50.740 --> 03:27:53.220]  not for gun control, get serious.
[03:27:53.220 --> 03:27:56.220]  Okay, yeah, we're gonna talk about that in a moment, too.
[03:27:56.220 --> 03:27:59.900]  They go on to say, even quoting a guy from the Woodrow Wilson Center, Russia has won
[03:27:59.900 --> 03:28:05.540]  the proxy war, at least for now, said Michael Kaufman, a fellow at the Woodrow Wilson Center
[03:28:05.540 --> 03:28:08.980]  in Washington, Woodrow Wilson, another globalist, okay?
[03:28:08.980 --> 03:28:12.940]  And as we pointed out, and we talked about it at the time, where did all this start,
[03:28:12.940 --> 03:28:13.940]  okay?
[03:28:13.940 --> 03:28:19.180]  Libya is the arms bizarre for chaos, especially for ISIS, for all these terrorists, that's
[03:28:19.180 --> 03:28:21.740]  where they're getting their weapons, that's where this all began.
[03:28:21.740 --> 03:28:22.900]  Why did that happen?
[03:28:22.900 --> 03:28:25.900]  Why do we have to overthrow the Syrian government?
[03:28:25.900 --> 03:28:28.020]  Why did we have to overthrow Libya?
[03:28:28.020 --> 03:28:31.540]  Well we know now, because WikiLeaks gave us Hillary Clinton's emails.
[03:28:31.540 --> 03:28:38.180]  We could see the emails back in 2011 between her and Sidney Blumenthal, okay?
[03:28:38.180 --> 03:28:42.900]  Talking about why it was necessary to take out Qaddafi.
[03:28:42.900 --> 03:28:48.820]  Now they've got a lot of oil, have a lot of water there, massive, massive freshwater underground
[03:28:48.820 --> 03:28:50.020]  supply there.
[03:28:50.020 --> 03:28:54.300]  But that wasn't really the core thing that they were after, it always goes back to the
[03:28:54.300 --> 03:28:55.300]  bankers, doesn't it?
[03:28:55.300 --> 03:28:57.860]  And every war goes back to the bankers.
[03:28:57.860 --> 03:29:03.360]  And they said, these sanctions aren't really gonna work, because Qaddafi has been stockpiling
[03:29:03.360 --> 03:29:04.360]  gold and silver.
[03:29:04.360 --> 03:29:11.660]  He's got about 143 tons of each, because he was going to back his currency with gold.
[03:29:11.660 --> 03:29:17.580]  You know, the French, he wanted to go in competition with the French franc, with the American dollar,
[03:29:17.580 --> 03:29:21.780]  with the Petro dollar that we created with the Saudi Arabians.
[03:29:21.780 --> 03:29:27.660]  They said he wants to establish a pan-African currency based on the Libyan dinar backed
[03:29:27.660 --> 03:29:28.820]  with gold.
[03:29:28.820 --> 03:29:34.900]  The plan was designed to provide the African countries, the Francophone African countries,
[03:29:34.900 --> 03:29:38.140]  the ones that had been under the dominance of the colonial powers.
[03:29:38.140 --> 03:29:42.220]  And you have to understand, they are still colonial powers, they're just trying to mask
[03:29:42.220 --> 03:29:43.220]  it.
[03:29:43.220 --> 03:29:44.940]  And they're trying to create chaos on both sides.
[03:29:44.940 --> 03:29:47.860]  They don't want competition with their fiat currencies.
[03:29:47.860 --> 03:29:48.860]  That's why they started this all.
[03:29:48.860 --> 03:29:50.500]  We'll be right back.
[03:29:50.500 --> 03:29:59.820]  The empires on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[03:29:59.820 --> 03:30:03.580]  Joe Bigger with infowars.com, article up by Express.
[03:30:03.580 --> 03:30:05.620]  Let refugees into your homes.
[03:30:05.620 --> 03:30:09.020]  France pleads with citizens to help ease migrant crisis.
[03:30:09.020 --> 03:30:11.140]  The same migrant crisis that they allowed to happen.
[03:30:11.140 --> 03:30:12.620]  Yeah, let's go ahead and bring them on in.
[03:30:12.620 --> 03:30:15.300]  We'll give them a machete or maybe a knife so they can cut our throats.
[03:30:15.300 --> 03:30:16.300]  It'll be fine.
[03:30:16.300 --> 03:30:20.820]  There are currently 147 reception centers across France, but these are all in massive
[03:30:20.820 --> 03:30:24.900]  demand as desperate refugees continue to flee the Middle East.
[03:30:24.900 --> 03:30:29.900]  Meanwhile, Barack Obama wants to bring these people into our country unvetted.
[03:30:29.900 --> 03:30:32.260]  Let's not let any more of this happen.
[03:30:32.260 --> 03:30:36.220]  That's why we need Donald Trump to secure the borders and we need to better vet these
[03:30:36.220 --> 03:30:37.220]  people.
[03:30:37.220 --> 03:30:40.540]  Look, you have families in Germany fleeing their country.
[03:30:40.540 --> 03:30:44.340]  The same country the angle of Merkel is allowing these people to come into and they are now
[03:30:44.340 --> 03:30:50.220]  going to Russia seeking asylum from these craze people who most of them want Sharia
[03:30:50.220 --> 03:30:51.340]  law.
[03:30:51.340 --> 03:30:52.340]  Open your eyes.
[03:30:52.340 --> 03:30:55.980]  If we don't secure our borders here in America, what we're seeing happen over in Europe will
[03:30:55.980 --> 03:30:56.980]  happen here.
[03:30:56.980 --> 03:30:58.980]  This has been Joe Biggs with infowars.com.
[03:30:58.980 --> 03:31:01.540]  Dr. Grimm, you developed living defense for us.
[03:31:01.540 --> 03:31:02.900]  It took you over a year to do it.
[03:31:02.900 --> 03:31:04.620]  Why is this so good?
[03:31:04.620 --> 03:31:09.300]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[03:31:09.300 --> 03:31:13.940]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in
[03:31:13.940 --> 03:31:14.940]  my system.
[03:31:14.940 --> 03:31:20.180]  But right now, we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful
[03:31:20.180 --> 03:31:25.460]  to your body that lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees spreading
[03:31:25.460 --> 03:31:26.700]  disease around.
[03:31:26.700 --> 03:31:29.340]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[03:31:29.340 --> 03:31:30.340]  These are all parasites.
[03:31:30.340 --> 03:31:33.020]  Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it.
[03:31:33.020 --> 03:31:34.300]  You have the neem in there.
[03:31:34.300 --> 03:31:37.380]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[03:31:37.380 --> 03:31:40.660]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[03:31:40.660 --> 03:31:41.660]  All right.
[03:31:41.660 --> 03:31:43.860]  Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[03:31:43.860 --> 03:31:45.020]  It just came back in yesterday.
[03:31:45.020 --> 03:31:46.860]  Living Defense, infowarslife.com.

[03:31:58.380 --> 03:31:59.380]  Yeah.

[03:32:05.620 --> 03:32:07.460]  bullet, I use them all.
[03:32:07.460 --> 03:32:08.460]  They're phenomenal.

[03:32:10.460 --> 03:32:11.460]  Thank you, brother.

[03:32:24.820 --> 03:32:25.820]  at the same time.
[03:32:25.820 --> 03:32:26.820]  I'm a nine-year listener.
[03:32:26.820 --> 03:32:28.820]  I buy all the nutraceuticals, Accio FX, Nacinotide.
[03:32:28.820 --> 03:32:29.820]  All right.
[03:32:29.820 --> 03:32:30.820]  Let me ask you a question.
[03:32:30.820 --> 03:32:31.820]  Have they worked for you?
[03:32:31.820 --> 03:32:35.460]  They're one of the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[03:32:35.460 --> 03:32:36.460]  What products are you taking?
[03:32:36.460 --> 03:32:37.460]  Are you taking?
[03:32:37.460 --> 03:32:44.780]  Everything from supermale to brain force to winter sun, X2, even got a little DNA force.
[03:32:44.780 --> 03:32:48.420]  So when I just re-upped everything and I just went to auto-fill.
[03:32:48.420 --> 03:32:53.540]  Visit infowarslifes.com to read the information and research and to see the reviews for yourself.
[03:32:53.540 --> 03:33:18.820]  Visit infowarslifes.com or call 888-253-3139.
[03:33:24.540 --> 03:33:26.140]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:26.140 --> 03:33:31.460]  I'm David Knight and we're going to go back to how Hillary founded ISIS and we're going
[03:33:31.460 --> 03:33:36.100]  to tell you how she ran guns, the big gun control lady, big gun runner.
[03:33:36.100 --> 03:33:42.060]  We're going to tell you how she helped to, she's warned about the black genocide that
[03:33:42.060 --> 03:33:43.260]  was going to happen in Libya.
[03:33:43.260 --> 03:33:44.740]  Didn't do anything about it.
[03:33:44.740 --> 03:33:46.340]  Didn't do anything to stop it.
[03:33:46.340 --> 03:33:51.740]  So here's this lady who says that she doesn't like guns, that she loves black people, but
[03:33:51.740 --> 03:33:56.980]  she supported a genocide against black people in Libya.
[03:33:56.980 --> 03:34:01.940]  This is the lady who tells us that she's for women's rights, but she cozies up to all of
[03:34:01.940 --> 03:34:04.900]  these Sharia people.
[03:34:04.900 --> 03:34:07.860]  Absolutely amazing, absolutely amazing that she gets away with all this.
[03:34:07.860 --> 03:34:11.540]  Before we go back to the news though, I want to remind you that we have a way for you to
[03:34:11.540 --> 03:34:15.620]  prepare for crisis, for bad weather.
[03:34:15.620 --> 03:34:20.740]  Whatever happens, you need to take advantage of the products that you can find that are
[03:34:20.740 --> 03:34:25.300]  going to help you to prepare for the unexpected, okay?
[03:34:25.300 --> 03:34:30.180]  We have an off the grid mega special that's going on right now at infowarslife.com.
[03:34:30.180 --> 03:34:34.380]  Starting with silver bullet, colloidal silver, we have 50% off and I'm glad I've got that
[03:34:34.380 --> 03:34:37.020]  there because I just ran out of colloidal silver myself.
[03:34:37.020 --> 03:34:38.020]  I use it for a lot of things.
[03:34:38.020 --> 03:34:43.260]  So if I'm starting to feel sick, especially when I'm traveling, take the silver when I'm
[03:34:43.260 --> 03:34:44.260]  doing that.
[03:34:44.260 --> 03:34:48.180]  Or if I even cut myself, I put silver on it, I don't get infected anymore.
[03:34:48.180 --> 03:34:54.460]  This is a well-known fact that you can see hospitals starting to use silver and bandages
[03:34:54.460 --> 03:34:55.460]  and other things.
[03:34:55.460 --> 03:34:59.540]  This is something that has been well-known for a very long time, how effective that is
[03:34:59.540 --> 03:35:01.660]  in a number of ways, topically or internally.
[03:35:01.660 --> 03:35:05.980]  And again, 50% off silver bullet, you can find that at infowarslife.com.
[03:35:05.980 --> 03:35:10.560]  Also many other things that are not health related we have on special right now.
[03:35:10.560 --> 03:35:16.740]  We have 20% off all Alexa Pure water filters, 20% off, that's from the smallest to the largest.
[03:35:16.740 --> 03:35:18.620]  That's at infowarsstore.com.
[03:35:18.620 --> 03:35:22.380]  Also 33% off the solar base station power supply.
[03:35:22.380 --> 03:35:27.580]  That is a solar collector, photovoltaic collector as well as a battery backup and inverter that
[03:35:27.580 --> 03:35:31.340]  you can hook that together up as a system for backup power supply.
[03:35:31.340 --> 03:35:34.300]  That's now 33% off at infowarsstore.com.
[03:35:34.300 --> 03:35:38.380]  It's transportable, so you can take it with you, part of your bug out preparations if
[03:35:38.380 --> 03:35:39.380]  you wish.
[03:35:39.380 --> 03:35:45.340]  Also, the infowars premium power pack, 20% off at infowarsstore.com, that's a small box
[03:35:45.340 --> 03:35:46.980]  that can crank your car.
[03:35:46.980 --> 03:35:52.340]  I know because I've had to do that, it's far better to do that than it is to take the
[03:35:52.340 --> 03:35:55.900]  risk of blowing out your alternator if you do it in the dark.
[03:35:55.900 --> 03:36:00.580]  It's much easier to do it with this thing, get it set up and then turn this on and it
[03:36:00.580 --> 03:36:04.860]  has the power to crank your car as well as to charge any of your devices.
[03:36:04.860 --> 03:36:11.140]  So 20% off that, a lot of specials you find at the off the grid, mega special at infowarslife.com
[03:36:11.140 --> 03:36:15.660]  including a massive discount off a silver bullet colloidal silver.
[03:36:15.660 --> 03:36:19.380]  Now as I was just talking about before we went to the break, the very fact that the
[03:36:19.380 --> 03:36:23.020]  New York Times would come out and say that we've got a proxy war going on, that we're
[03:36:23.020 --> 03:36:28.700]  losing it, that we're on the side of ISIS, that the CIA has trained and equipped and
[03:36:28.700 --> 03:36:33.020]  continues to supply ISIS and we were doing really good until the Russians came in.
[03:36:33.020 --> 03:36:37.100]  We were going to win with our ISIS forces, with al-Qaeda, just like we'd won with al-Qaeda
[03:36:37.100 --> 03:36:39.020]  against the Russians in Afghanistan.
[03:36:39.020 --> 03:36:45.260]  Now we call them ISIS, but they always like to say it's ISIL, because if you say it's
[03:36:45.260 --> 03:36:52.180]  the Islamic State and Iraq and Syria, it kind of gives you an idea that we created ISIS
[03:36:52.180 --> 03:36:54.820]  to go against Syria.
[03:36:54.820 --> 03:37:00.380]  And we were talking about what was going on with the reasons why they overthrew Grafi
[03:37:00.380 --> 03:37:01.900]  and Libya.
[03:37:01.900 --> 03:37:04.820]  We were talking about that five years ago, everybody was talking about that five years
[03:37:04.820 --> 03:37:10.540]  ago when it happened in 2011, and we reported as well as New American and others reported,
[03:37:10.540 --> 03:37:14.020]  look, Gaddafi has been saying that he's going to set up this gold-backed currency.
[03:37:14.020 --> 03:37:19.060]  He's going to go in competition to the central banks, the Fiat currencies on the west.
[03:37:19.060 --> 03:37:22.180]  That would have devastated the dollar, would have devastated the Petro dollar, because
[03:37:22.180 --> 03:37:27.780]  he would have had his own oil-based dollar that was also backed by gold.
[03:37:27.780 --> 03:37:32.660]  Ours is backed by nothing, but our relationship with these murderers in Saudi Arabia.
[03:37:32.660 --> 03:37:35.340]  So that was a very dangerous thing, it was dangerous for us.
[03:37:35.340 --> 03:37:38.540]  They said, hey, the French are going to come in too, because they still see themselves
[03:37:38.540 --> 03:37:43.140]  as a colonial power in the north of Africa.
[03:37:43.140 --> 03:37:48.260]  And they're concerned they don't want Gaddafi joining with Sub-Saharan Africa.
[03:37:48.260 --> 03:37:50.460]  And so that was a large part of what happened there.
[03:37:50.460 --> 03:37:54.780]  But then there were emails that have been released now by WikiLeaks that show that, yes, what
[03:37:54.780 --> 03:37:57.940]  we were talking about at InfoWars, what the New American was talking about, what others
[03:37:57.940 --> 03:38:00.620]  were talking about, not the mainstream media at the time.
[03:38:00.620 --> 03:38:04.740]  Our analysis of it saying, hey, I think this is about the gold-backed currency.
[03:38:04.740 --> 03:38:09.300]  Now we see the emails between Sidney Blumenthal and Hillary Clinton saying, this is about
[03:38:09.300 --> 03:38:11.500]  the gold-backed currency.
[03:38:11.500 --> 03:38:16.060]  So it's like the NSA whistleblowers telling us right after 9-11, people like William
[03:38:16.060 --> 03:38:23.580]  Binney, Thomas Drake, warning us that the government was going to use the 9-11 situation
[03:38:23.580 --> 03:38:27.900]  to go after all of our privacy, to do dragnet surveillance.
[03:38:27.900 --> 03:38:32.620]  But then people didn't believe it until 2000, and what was it, 12 when Snowden came out?
[03:38:32.620 --> 03:38:34.980]  I think it was 12 when he came out, maybe 13.
[03:38:34.980 --> 03:38:40.740]  They didn't believe it for a dozen years, okay, until they saw the documents.
[03:38:40.740 --> 03:38:41.820]  So now we have the documents.
[03:38:41.820 --> 03:38:46.940]  They're going after them because of the gold-backed currency competing with our fiat currency,
[03:38:46.940 --> 03:38:48.860]  our central bank.
[03:38:48.860 --> 03:38:51.220]  The fact that they were running guns to terrorists, they talk about.
[03:38:51.220 --> 03:38:58.380]  The fact that the people that we were backing were going to be shooting on site what they
[03:38:58.380 --> 03:39:00.780]  called foreigners in Libya.
[03:39:00.780 --> 03:39:04.380]  How do they recognize the foreigners at site?
[03:39:04.380 --> 03:39:07.220]  How did they know just by sight that they're foreigners?
[03:39:07.220 --> 03:39:08.460]  Well, because they're black.
[03:39:08.460 --> 03:39:13.180]  See, they understood that the people that they would identify as being black were the
[03:39:13.180 --> 03:39:19.620]  sub-saharons that Gaddafi was trying to help, that he was working with to create this pan-African
[03:39:19.620 --> 03:39:20.860]  alliance.
[03:39:20.860 --> 03:39:28.500]  So these people are Arab terrorists that we were using as proxies, as surrogates.
[03:39:28.500 --> 03:39:32.500]  We're going to shoot on site anybody with black skin.
[03:39:32.500 --> 03:39:34.020]  There's Hillary Clinton for you.
[03:39:34.020 --> 03:39:36.340]  Yeah, that's Hillary Clinton.
[03:39:36.340 --> 03:39:40.660]  And as we look at what's going on now in Turkey as well, Turkey is now starting to move towards
[03:39:40.660 --> 03:39:41.660]  Russia.
[03:39:41.660 --> 03:39:49.620]  If you remember when the coup happened, okay, they shut down the American military base.
[03:39:49.620 --> 03:39:53.780]  After air base there in Turkey has a lot of nuclear weapons.
[03:39:53.780 --> 03:39:55.900]  They cut the power off for over a week.
[03:39:55.900 --> 03:39:57.220]  They isolated the air base.
[03:39:57.220 --> 03:39:58.900]  They isolated the Americans there.
[03:39:58.900 --> 03:40:01.660]  And they began talking to Russia.
[03:40:01.660 --> 03:40:06.180]  And they said at the same time, we believe, whether this is true or not, Erdogan was saying,
[03:40:06.180 --> 03:40:07.300]  we want Fatala Gulen.
[03:40:07.300 --> 03:40:13.100]  We think that it's his people, his forces, people loyal to him that began this coup.
[03:40:13.100 --> 03:40:15.460]  And we want you to turn over Gulen.
[03:40:15.460 --> 03:40:18.980]  They've had a civil war for quite some time.
[03:40:18.980 --> 03:40:23.180]  It hasn't turned into a shooting war, except just occasionally and most recently was the
[03:40:23.180 --> 03:40:25.300]  biggest event of that.
[03:40:25.300 --> 03:40:29.420]  But there has been this civil war essentially going on between Erdogan and Gulen.
[03:40:29.420 --> 03:40:36.620]  Both of them, by the way, both of them radical Islamists, both of them want an Islamic caliphate.
[03:40:36.620 --> 03:40:39.540]  Neither of them are good guys, okay?
[03:40:39.540 --> 03:40:43.060]  But we have a lot of ties to Fatala Gulen.
[03:40:43.060 --> 03:40:50.340]  Erdogan, who has isolated this base, who is now making overtures to Russia, essentially
[03:40:50.340 --> 03:40:55.060]  sending signals to us that he's going to shut down that US military base.
[03:40:55.060 --> 03:40:59.340]  What he wants is Gulen, extradited.
[03:40:59.340 --> 03:41:02.580]  But the American government isn't going to give him Gulen.
[03:41:02.580 --> 03:41:07.180]  Not even to save their nuclear air base there in Turkey.
[03:41:07.180 --> 03:41:08.660]  That's how important he is to them.
[03:41:08.660 --> 03:41:14.380]  And who else is he important to? Not just to Obama, but also to Hillary Clinton, okay?
[03:41:14.380 --> 03:41:20.060]  We got a recent article from Breitbart talking about how the lawyer for Erdogan that has
[03:41:20.060 --> 03:41:26.660]  been coming after Gulen here in America, Robert Amsterdam, said Gulen's Islamist cult buys
[03:41:26.660 --> 03:41:31.060]  off US politicians in both parties to avoid investigations, okay?
[03:41:31.060 --> 03:41:34.260]  Well, we've been warned by this by both the left and the right.
[03:41:34.260 --> 03:41:38.380]  We've had the daily caller on the right, and we've had the daily beast on the left, both
[03:41:38.380 --> 03:41:47.100]  telling us about the ties between Fatala Gulen and Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton, okay?
[03:41:47.100 --> 03:41:55.100]  Hillary Clinton, the daily beast says Fatala Gulen just had a news conference in his compound
[03:41:55.100 --> 03:42:00.940]  in Pennsylvania where he was praising Hillary Clinton and talking about his close relationships.
[03:42:00.940 --> 03:42:03.460]  He says she's very courteous, very kind.
[03:42:03.460 --> 03:42:09.260]  This is exactly what the Secret Service agents who protect or say, isn't it? No, no, it's
[03:42:09.260 --> 03:42:10.260]  not what they say.
[03:42:10.260 --> 03:42:14.020]  He says, before meeting some years ago, President Clinton, Bill Clinton, was facing a difficult
[03:42:14.020 --> 03:42:15.020]  situation here in America.
[03:42:15.020 --> 03:42:16.660]  I wrote a letter to him encouraging him.
[03:42:16.660 --> 03:42:20.220]  He is such a successful president, and Hillary actually wrote a response to that letter.
[03:42:20.220 --> 03:42:24.100]  I find her to be very courteous and kind, a great hope for this country.
[03:42:24.100 --> 03:42:29.940]  And so the daily pastry points that, but also the daily caller back in November, and a lot
[03:42:29.940 --> 03:42:35.540]  of people have pointed out the fact that a former president of the Gulen-linked Turkish
[03:42:35.540 --> 03:42:40.780]  Cultural Center, Oskar, gave between a half million and a million dollars to the Clinton
[03:42:40.780 --> 03:42:43.180]  Foundation in recent months.
[03:42:43.180 --> 03:42:48.960]  He also served as a national finance co-chair last year for a pro-Clinton political action
[03:42:48.960 --> 03:42:50.860]  committee called Ready Pack.
[03:42:50.860 --> 03:42:55.620]  Now, how does this affect us besides the fact that this is yet another example of a foreign
[03:42:55.620 --> 03:43:01.700]  government like Saudi Arabia who bragged that they have given Hillary Clinton 20% of her
[03:43:01.700 --> 03:43:05.380]  campaign contributions?
[03:43:05.380 --> 03:43:06.980]  How does this affect us?
[03:43:06.980 --> 03:43:13.360]  Of course, we've seen Hillary Clinton choosing to have a Sharia lawyer, somebody who has
[03:43:13.360 --> 03:43:16.660]  abused the EB-5 visa program.
[03:43:16.660 --> 03:43:21.020]  She chose to have him speak just prior to her accepting the nomination.
[03:43:21.020 --> 03:43:26.540]  Why, because, well, he would attack Donald Trump personally, and hopefully Donald Trump
[03:43:26.540 --> 03:43:29.780]  would take the bait and he'd come after him and then they would say, oh, he's against
[03:43:29.780 --> 03:43:30.780]  Muslims.
[03:43:30.780 --> 03:43:33.380]  Well, no, we're against Sharia law, okay?
[03:43:33.380 --> 03:43:38.900]  But she has this guy who is a Sharia lawyer, Sharia Khan.
[03:43:38.900 --> 03:43:44.100]  She also then has the guy that looks like Super Mario, the Taliban, who is behind her, the
[03:43:44.100 --> 03:43:49.620]  guy from Afghanistan, a Talibanist, and she has him sitting behind her.
[03:43:49.620 --> 03:43:54.140]  As we've pointed out, as others have pointed out, you don't get to set behind the candidate
[03:43:54.140 --> 03:43:56.420]  unless they know who you are, okay?
[03:43:56.420 --> 03:44:00.540]  So she has all that, and then she has this close relationship with Fatala Ghulain.
[03:44:00.540 --> 03:44:04.900]  So this is more than just foreign money coming in, folks.
[03:44:04.900 --> 03:44:09.980]  The Ghulain people are connected to a network, and we've mentioned this many times, connected
[03:44:09.980 --> 03:44:12.100]  to a network of charter schools.
[03:44:12.100 --> 03:44:16.580]  Charter schools are kind of quasi, there he is, there's Super Mario over there, right
[03:44:16.580 --> 03:44:19.740]  there, she can see me, doesn't he look like Super Mario?
[03:44:19.740 --> 03:44:24.620]  So he's perfectly harmless, you know, because he looks like Mario.
[03:44:24.620 --> 03:44:31.500]  The charter schools that are being run by the Ghulainists in America are not overtly Islamic.
[03:44:31.500 --> 03:44:38.740]  They have more subtle ways to recruit people into the Turkish culture, into the Turkish
[03:44:38.740 --> 03:44:41.820]  religion and the Turkish politics, okay?
[03:44:41.820 --> 03:44:47.380]  And they don't get overtly religious because they're getting half a billion dollars.
[03:44:47.380 --> 03:44:52.820]  They've got about 140 some-odd schools in the United States, bulk of them are in Texas.
[03:44:52.820 --> 03:44:57.700]  We've reported on this, we've had the fellow Mark Hall who did the documentary, Killing
[03:44:57.700 --> 03:45:03.260]  Ed, and by the way, that is something that was completely shut down at South by Southwest.
[03:45:03.260 --> 03:45:06.940]  Even though it was a documentary that had national importance and was focused here in
[03:45:06.940 --> 03:45:11.100]  Texas that didn't show it in South by Southwest, New York Times wouldn't review it, now they're
[03:45:11.100 --> 03:45:18.460]  going to have a tour, they're going to have several Texas cities starting August 29th,
[03:45:18.460 --> 03:45:23.100]  they're going to be in Austin, Texas, then 30th in Houston, then in Dallas, San Antonio,
[03:45:23.100 --> 03:45:26.540]  El Paso, so check out their site.
[03:45:26.540 --> 03:45:30.060]  You need to understand what's going on with charter schools, you need to understand the
[03:45:30.060 --> 03:45:32.240]  danger for crony capitalism there.
[03:45:32.240 --> 03:45:39.020]  You need to understand that this is a situation where they operate as private schools and
[03:45:39.020 --> 03:45:46.020]  yet they are publicly funded with taxpayer money, it is a perfect storm of crony capitalism.
[03:45:46.020 --> 03:45:50.900]  But the worst case scenario that he points out in this documentary is that somebody can
[03:45:50.900 --> 03:45:57.540]  take this over with an Islamic agenda, okay, which is what we're seeing.
[03:45:57.540 --> 03:46:04.940]  And even Peggy Noonan, who has not been very friendly to Donald Trump, has an op-ed piece
[03:46:04.940 --> 03:46:10.140]  in the Wall Street Journal, how the global elites forsake their countrymen.
[03:46:10.140 --> 03:46:15.140]  And she's looking at Angela Merkel and what's going on there and she says, you know, Mrs.
[03:46:15.140 --> 03:46:20.540]  Merkel moved unilaterally announcing that Germany would take an astounding 800,000 people
[03:46:20.540 --> 03:46:21.540]  last year.
[03:46:21.540 --> 03:46:25.100]  Naturally, this was taken as an invitation and more than a million came, the result
[03:46:25.100 --> 03:46:32.020]  has been widespread public furor over the resulting crime, cultural dissimilation, fears
[03:46:32.020 --> 03:46:37.180]  of terrorism, not just fears of terrorism, folk, actual terrorism, okay.
[03:46:37.180 --> 03:46:42.660]  From such a sturdy, grounded character as Mrs. Merkel writes, Peggy Noonan, the decision
[03:46:42.660 --> 03:46:43.660]  was puzzling.
[03:46:43.660 --> 03:46:50.700]  Okay, look, if she was sturdy and grounded, you have to understand this is not a mistake,
[03:46:50.700 --> 03:46:51.700]  folks.
[03:46:51.700 --> 03:46:54.140]  We've pointed this out over and over again here at InfoWars.
[03:46:54.140 --> 03:46:58.660]  This is not a mistake, it's a plan, it's a plan.
[03:46:58.660 --> 03:47:03.740]  We see it, Peggy Noonan can't admit it yet, okay, she just said it was puzzling.
[03:47:03.740 --> 03:47:07.540]  She was uncharacteristically romantic about people, how they lived their lives and their
[03:47:07.540 --> 03:47:12.420]  history, you know, she just made a mistake, she's just this romantic person.
[03:47:12.420 --> 03:47:17.940]  Normally she's very rational, she's very hard, she's very cold, she's very calculating.
[03:47:17.940 --> 03:47:23.540]  But here she just gave in to her romantic feminine side here, just too much of a heart,
[03:47:23.540 --> 03:47:27.420]  you know, she just had a heart for these people, couldn't help them in their country, couldn't
[03:47:27.420 --> 03:47:32.820]  do anything to stop our surrogate proxy war that created this situation that I just talked
[03:47:32.820 --> 03:47:35.780]  about, couldn't do anything to stop all that as a rational person.
[03:47:35.780 --> 03:47:40.060]  So her heart just got the better of her, and they all came into this country.
[03:47:40.060 --> 03:47:45.860]  No, it is not a mistake, it's not their heart getting the best of them.
[03:47:45.860 --> 03:47:51.660]  This is a plan, and as I pointed out on the nightly news, the people in Germany understand
[03:47:51.660 --> 03:47:52.660]  this as well.
[03:47:52.660 --> 03:48:00.100]  I read an editorial that I translated from German, a rough translation with Google, and
[03:48:00.100 --> 03:48:05.180]  the guy was saying, this is the great people replacement.
[03:48:05.180 --> 03:48:06.180]  Understand that.
[03:48:06.180 --> 03:48:09.460]  We need to stop talking about it as open borders and immigration.
[03:48:09.460 --> 03:48:14.900]  It is a plan to replace the people that has begun.
[03:48:14.900 --> 03:48:19.620]  They don't like the German people being in Germany, they don't like the American people
[03:48:19.620 --> 03:48:20.620]  being in America.
[03:48:20.620 --> 03:48:27.980]  They want to replace us with people that are more malleable, people who have lower expectations.
[03:48:27.980 --> 03:48:33.660]  Because as we see our standard of living declining, we're going to get upset, we're already upset.
[03:48:33.660 --> 03:48:35.460]  We already know what you're doing to us.
[03:48:35.460 --> 03:48:40.380]  We already know that when you talk about one world and a one world government and you want
[03:48:40.380 --> 03:48:45.420]  to make everybody the same, that doesn't mean that you want to lift up the people in the
[03:48:45.420 --> 03:48:47.060]  third world to our level.
[03:48:47.060 --> 03:48:51.660]  That means you're going to level us down to third world levels.
[03:48:51.660 --> 03:48:57.780]  You are destroying these countries because you want everybody leveled to the lowest possible
[03:48:57.780 --> 03:48:59.740]  denominator.
[03:48:59.740 --> 03:49:03.740]  You want a one world, not a first world and a third world, and you want everybody in that
[03:49:03.740 --> 03:49:05.980]  case to be at the third world level.
[03:49:05.980 --> 03:49:07.460]  That's what's going to happen with this.
[03:49:07.460 --> 03:49:13.660]  As a matter of fact, as I was looking at the editorial, he actually compared it to what
[03:49:13.660 --> 03:49:19.100]  a communist Bert Holt Breck saw in East Germany in 1953.
[03:49:19.100 --> 03:49:22.740]  The people there, ironically enough, they felt betrayed.
[03:49:22.740 --> 03:49:27.540]  They had this communist government that said they were there for the people.
[03:49:27.540 --> 03:49:32.060]  Everybody was going to be treated the same, and yet they had minimum wage for some people,
[03:49:32.060 --> 03:49:35.300]  not for the elites who ruled the country.
[03:49:35.300 --> 03:49:36.940]  They said, we can't live on this.
[03:49:36.940 --> 03:49:38.940]  The minimum wage is too low.
[03:49:38.940 --> 03:49:39.940]  Does that sound familiar?
[03:49:39.940 --> 03:49:44.180]  Does that sound like the Democrat Party's disillusioned constituents?
[03:49:44.180 --> 03:49:49.940]  So what they did was they rioted, and what they got from the communist elite was an iron
[03:49:49.940 --> 03:49:52.500]  fist in their face.
[03:49:52.500 --> 03:49:55.660]  The military, the police, tanks, okay?
[03:49:55.660 --> 03:50:01.380]  Put that down in 1953, and so as he looked at that, even the guy who liked communism
[03:50:01.380 --> 03:50:07.060]  looked at the ruthless repression of the people who said, we need a higher minimum wage.
[03:50:07.060 --> 03:50:13.300]  He said, well, I guess we can't dissolve parliament anymore, but parliament can dissolve the people.
[03:50:13.300 --> 03:50:15.620]  It's far easier that way, isn't it?
[03:50:15.620 --> 03:50:19.940]  What is happening right now in the West is the great people replacement.
[03:50:19.940 --> 03:50:23.140]  It is the great leveling that is going on.
[03:50:23.140 --> 03:50:29.060]  And even when you've got somebody like Peggy Noonan saying, she means well.
[03:50:29.060 --> 03:50:34.500]  She's usually very rational, Merkel is just attempting to provide some kind of a counterstatement
[03:50:34.500 --> 03:50:40.740]  about the great sin of the 20th century, the historical sin and the stain of Nazism.
[03:50:40.740 --> 03:50:43.740]  And it's like, no, that's not it.
[03:50:43.740 --> 03:50:44.740]  That's not it.
[03:50:44.740 --> 03:50:45.740]  It's not that kind of guilt.
[03:50:45.740 --> 03:50:46.900]  That's what they use on people.
[03:50:46.900 --> 03:50:48.340]  They use racism.
[03:50:48.340 --> 03:50:51.900]  They use that type of guilt, but that's not driving it in France.
[03:50:51.900 --> 03:50:54.220]  It's not what is driving Obama.
[03:50:54.220 --> 03:50:56.900]  He's not trying to get rid of the stain of Nazism here.
[03:50:56.900 --> 03:51:01.540]  He's trying to replace the people and to level us all at a third-world level.
[03:51:01.540 --> 03:51:06.060]  Are you one of the millions of Americans who suffer from digestive issues like heartburn,

[03:53:02.820 --> 03:53:03.820]  sleeping.
[03:53:03.820 --> 03:53:04.820]  Pillows would go flat.
[03:53:04.820 --> 03:53:06.300]  I would flip flop all night long.
[03:53:06.300 --> 03:53:10.540]  I would wake up with a sore neck, maybe a headache or feel like I needed a nap even though I slept
[03:53:10.540 --> 03:53:11.540]  eight hours.
[03:53:11.540 --> 03:53:15.140]  When I invented MyPillow, I wanted it to where you could move the patent and fill to give

[03:54:22.420 --> 03:54:28.220]  Alex about that, yeah, it really is there.
[03:54:28.220 --> 03:54:30.540]  Maybe you don't want to believe your eyes but we're going to talk about that but real

[03:55:13.700 --> 03:55:16.180]  I don't know who knows where the water is coming from.

[03:55:28.980 --> 03:55:34.260]  and fluorides or if you're out in a rural area and you don't know what kind of chemicals
[03:55:34.260 --> 03:55:37.700]  and runoff are in that, this will get it out.

[03:56:14.500 --> 03:56:20.060]  We had the caller who said, hey prove that there is fraud going on and as I've mentioned
[03:56:20.060 --> 03:56:26.420]  before the last election 2012 friend of my brother in law said that he went to vote and
[03:56:26.420 --> 03:56:31.060]  they told him that he had already voted along with his dead mother because all you have
[03:56:31.060 --> 03:56:35.780]  to do is walk in and give them a name and an address, okay?
[03:56:35.780 --> 03:56:42.020]  But we can see when we look at James O'Keeffe and others, I mean we've got the CBS news
[03:56:42.020 --> 03:56:45.780]  going there showing you the electronic voting machine and saying look, here's how I can
[03:56:45.780 --> 03:56:48.260]  manipulate this thing and that's not the first time this happened.
[03:56:48.260 --> 03:56:52.700]  We've had mainstream media show us for years there's some really old video that's been
[03:56:52.700 --> 03:56:57.100]  going back 10, 15 years and by the way, a lot of the video, a lot of the voting machines
[03:56:57.100 --> 03:56:59.580]  are 10 or 15 years old as well, okay?
[03:56:59.580 --> 03:57:03.180]  Which means that they are incredibly vulnerable to fraud.
[03:57:03.180 --> 03:57:08.380]  But if we show you somebody walking in and giving them a false name and they know that
[03:57:08.380 --> 03:57:12.820]  it's false and he says, hey, I don't have any ID, just let me vote and I say okay fine,
[03:57:12.820 --> 03:57:14.180]  sure, we'll let you vote.
[03:57:14.180 --> 03:57:18.540]  Just sign this paper affirming that that's who you are and we'll let you vote.
[03:57:18.540 --> 03:57:25.820]  When you see that happen, when you see the voting machines being rigged live on television
[03:57:25.820 --> 03:57:32.300]  and when we tell you firsthand that this is happening, do stores have to use voter ID
[03:57:32.300 --> 03:57:36.940]  only after they've had people rip them off multiple times by writing bad checks or doing
[03:57:36.940 --> 03:57:37.940]  other things?
[03:57:37.940 --> 03:57:38.940]  Of course not.
[03:57:38.940 --> 03:57:40.780]  They understand that's a possibility.
[03:57:40.780 --> 03:57:45.100]  And if you show them how easy it is to do that, they would be fools not to do that and
[03:57:45.100 --> 03:57:49.900]  yet when they try to enact voter ID, when they say we're going to require you to show
[03:57:49.900 --> 03:57:55.020]  us some picture ID in order to vote in North Carolina, they say that's racist, okay?
[03:57:55.020 --> 03:58:00.940]  It's also racist, they say, if they gerrymandered the districts and that was something that happened
[03:58:00.940 --> 03:58:06.020]  for the Republicans, they got to draw the district lines for the first time in 2010.
[03:58:06.020 --> 03:58:08.300]  Never got a chance to do that before the Republicans.
[03:58:08.300 --> 03:58:11.940]  Immediately they said, well, that's going against the black vote.
[03:58:11.940 --> 03:58:16.020]  Well, 90% of the people who are black are voting for the Democrats and yes, they were
[03:58:16.020 --> 03:58:19.020]  trying to bias this in favor of the Republicans instead of the Democrats.
[03:58:19.020 --> 03:58:20.620]  I don't like gerrymandering laws.
[03:58:20.620 --> 03:58:24.140]  I think that would just go with contiguous geographical regions.
[03:58:24.140 --> 03:58:28.300]  But every time they do something to change the voting laws and there's no reason you
[03:58:28.300 --> 03:58:31.580]  wouldn't have voter IDs, it's racist, it's racist.
[03:58:31.580 --> 03:58:32.580]  That's all here.
[03:58:32.580 --> 03:58:36.540]  All right, join us tonight, 7th Central, 8pm Eastern for the Info Wars Nightly News.
[03:58:36.540 --> 03:58:48.580]  I'm Leigh Ann McAdoo will be hosting.
