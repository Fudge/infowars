[00:00.000 --> 00:11.660]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.660 --> 00:19.200]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.200 --> 00:37.440]  Texas Alex Jones
[00:37.440 --> 00:46.000]  well it's already Wednesday the 10th day of July 2013 and McClatchy I saw this a
[00:46.000 --> 00:50.080]  few days ago but it's finally broken big today and we mentioned it yesterday
[00:50.080 --> 00:56.440]  McClatchy uncovers Obama's insider threat program and the manual is all
[00:56.440 --> 01:01.800]  public it says is someone having trouble at home is someone asking questions is
[01:01.800 --> 01:07.080]  someone taking vacations basically everyone is an inside threat but the
[01:07.080 --> 01:11.260]  global offshore banks that have hijacked the entire government and are
[01:11.260 --> 01:17.880]  overthrowing the entire Bill of Rights and Constitution everyone is a threat
[01:17.880 --> 01:23.800]  but the actual threat and this is what the NSA basically spends most time doing
[01:23.800 --> 01:27.720]  is making sure that people in government but also in private industry
[01:27.720 --> 01:32.560]  aren't able to stop government narcotics trafficking operations murder
[01:32.560 --> 01:38.320]  teams you name it they're running it the NSA is there to protect the criminal
[01:38.320 --> 01:43.600]  globalists that have hijacked America and the world period I mean I told you
[01:43.600 --> 01:48.720]  two years ago that the Stuxnet virus was launched by the people that run the US
[01:48.720 --> 01:56.240]  and Israel and then now Snowden has leaked those documents of course it was
[01:56.240 --> 02:01.920]  launched by the West against Iran and of course they're trying to use Stuxnet to
[02:01.920 --> 02:06.200]  pass cybersecurity that's already in place kind of like there's already FEMA
[02:06.200 --> 02:09.880]  camps but they've reintroduced this year the emergency centers establishment
[02:09.880 --> 02:16.800]  act that just expands it all and has it go public this is how they operate so
[02:16.800 --> 02:24.200]  we're going to be breaking all of that down here today on the main broadcast and
[02:24.200 --> 02:28.920]  going over it because even though this is old news to our audience now people
[02:28.920 --> 02:32.800]  are finally ready to hear about it and I've told my researchers and writers go
[02:32.800 --> 02:37.000]  back to all the FBI bulletins of the last decade where they say talking on a
[02:37.000 --> 02:42.680]  cell phone having a baby carriage being a priest wearing blue jeans being rude
[02:42.680 --> 02:47.760]  to police being nice to police taking photos of anything being a vegetarian
[02:47.760 --> 02:52.520]  there are hundreds of these bulletins put out a year where everyone's a
[02:52.520 --> 02:58.400]  terrorist how about work for offshore above the law banks that a diplomatic
[02:58.400 --> 03:02.320]  community that are looting country and offshoring jobs and paying 21 billion
[03:02.320 --> 03:06.960]  dollars a ship General Motors of China how about spies on the people illegally
[03:06.960 --> 03:10.880]  how about as federalized police and turn them into a paramilitary force with
[03:10.880 --> 03:15.320]  hundreds of taser deaths a year now with the police doing proctology exams
[03:15.320 --> 03:20.520]  without warrants on the side of the highway what about takes a page from
[03:20.520 --> 03:24.000]  every dictatorship in history and integrates it into a high-tech takeover

[03:28.440 --> 03:32.800]  Rights Constitution how about some manuals on that no the manuals instead

[03:43.680 --> 03:50.520]  manual from 15 years ago and they have more modern ones that say is sweating is
[03:50.520 --> 03:57.000]  sweating can you imagine sweating my goodness oh by the way it was in the
[03:57.000 --> 04:01.560]  New York Daily News and New York Post few days ago the police came and they
[04:01.560 --> 04:04.800]  said look it doesn't matter if we let you into the country club and you were
[04:04.800 --> 04:09.600]  outside quietly on a patio breastfeeding with a napkin over your

[04:16.480 --> 04:21.680]  breastfeeding is terrorism everything's terrorism but black armored vehicles

[08:33.080 --> 08:42.040]  ladies and gentlemen we are live it is Wednesday already the 10th day of July
[08:42.040 --> 08:49.280]  2013 and a lot of what we're going to cover today I have been covering over
[08:49.280 --> 08:54.120]  and over again at nauseam for a very long time but now because it's mainstream
[08:54.120 --> 09:00.400]  news and we have more details finally people may actually listen and understand
[09:00.400 --> 09:10.200]  what we're facing as a society but coming up in the second hour today I'm
[09:10.200 --> 09:15.480]  going to get into not the big stories that are out there about how the feds
[09:15.480 --> 09:21.760]  are spying on each other but the hundreds of communities against terrorism
[09:21.760 --> 09:27.120]  Department of Justice FBI fliers that are put out each year where they list
[09:27.120 --> 09:33.760]  pregnant women wearing blue jeans having a cell phone saying hi to the police
[09:33.760 --> 09:43.480]  paying for anything including coffee with cash as a reason to call the FBI and
[09:43.480 --> 09:50.120]  we're going to be going over this in detail so that you understand they want
[09:50.120 --> 09:55.520]  you to trust no one everyone is suspect everyone is guilty until proven slave
[09:55.520 --> 10:03.720]  never innocent except for the occupied federal government who is openly run by
[10:03.720 --> 10:10.160]  really four but you can count two sub banks but six global private banks that
[10:10.160 --> 10:14.680]  openly brag they've captured Europe and the United States completely and are
[10:14.680 --> 10:19.840]  going to end the free market and bankrupt everyone but themselves as a tool of
[10:19.840 --> 10:25.080]  political control the only economy will be the megastate and the select
[10:25.080 --> 10:31.240]  corporations that control it this is the open statement the open plan of the New
[10:31.240 --> 10:36.800]  World Order and again how did I know all this was coming ladies and gentlemen
[10:36.800 --> 10:40.560]  I've studied history I could see the common sense most of this was public
[10:40.560 --> 10:46.280]  when I first got on air 18 years ago I then got as the FBI would call radicalized
[10:46.280 --> 10:51.360]  very quickly by actually going and and watching federal drills and military
[10:51.360 --> 10:57.640]  drills where the enemy was the proto tea party role players wearing overalls and
[10:57.640 --> 11:02.400]  John Deere caps simply saying we'd like freedom we don't want to have our farms
[11:02.400 --> 11:07.600]  taken we don't want to turn our guns in and they practice mowing you down the
[11:07.600 --> 11:11.840]  army and the Marines I've made four police tape films it's all on tape they
[11:11.840 --> 11:17.320]  practice mowing you down murdering you and your family 24-7 they're training
[11:17.320 --> 11:23.360]  for absolute criminal evil takeover in this country and it's built and built
[11:23.360 --> 11:27.400]  and built you know in the old days if they had you and troops in Louisiana to
[11:27.400 --> 11:30.880]  do a drill with people saying I'm an American you can't come to my house and
[11:30.880 --> 11:36.160]  take the guns the military people videotaping that the US Army and Marines
[11:36.160 --> 11:41.280]  being trained would freak out and leak the video they leaked it to the militia
[11:41.280 --> 11:46.640]  in 93 94 95 and the top general you know that footage is out there cooperative
[11:46.640 --> 11:50.200]  nugget just search it it's out there clip stuff that are in my films and the
[11:50.200 --> 11:54.760]  generals are you are the forces of the New World Order we are bringing in
[11:54.760 --> 12:00.680]  global government and you're just like whoa and then you come and warn people
[12:00.680 --> 12:06.520]  are like that video couldn't be real our military isn't doing that
[12:09.160 --> 12:16.120]  Russian troops Chinese troops Israeli troops French troops Dutch troops UK
[12:16.120 --> 12:21.640]  troops Australian troops Canadian troops Mexican troops all on video
[12:21.640 --> 12:26.880]  official operations and I may tell you show up to these and even though they're
[12:26.880 --> 12:30.360]  supposedly press can be there because it could well at first they were secret
[12:30.360 --> 12:33.960]  but the videos would leak then they would put on kind of public ones but
[12:33.960 --> 12:39.720]  then I would go with the citizen tour instead of the the minute media turn
[12:39.720 --> 12:43.720]  then they would find me and throw me out and that's on tape in places like
[12:43.720 --> 12:47.600]  Oakland where they would let me film an interrogation of like where'd you get
[12:47.600 --> 12:51.880]  the helmet where'd you get the gun in San Francisco and okay and what what
[12:51.880 --> 12:56.520]  militia are you with and then all of a sudden they'd have the Marines civilian
[12:56.520 --> 13:01.080]  PR guy who was really a sheep-dead Marine you know jump out until Jones get out
[13:01.080 --> 13:06.680]  of here who's just turning red at me you ain't supposed to see this oh I know I'm
[13:06.680 --> 13:13.280]  not training for illegal open war with the American people now it's all out in
[13:13.280 --> 13:17.880]  the open now it's in Army times now it's in Stars and Stripes it yeah the Army
[13:17.880 --> 13:21.320]  and Marines will be armed and they're gonna be on streets near you to keep
[13:21.320 --> 13:26.600]  you safe from the terror threat and it's not that it's not al-Qaeda anymore why
[13:26.600 --> 13:30.640]  they're the good guys we're told that they're on active duty under the Pentagon
[13:30.640 --> 13:38.200]  under NATO all over the world just in giant mass-murdered operations they
[13:38.200 --> 13:41.560]  publicly got caught in one of the cities of the filming how they were gonna
[13:41.560 --> 13:44.920]  release chemical weapons a year ago and so now it's come out mainstream news
[13:44.920 --> 13:48.320]  that indeed they launched the chemical attacks and it was a false flag to blame
[13:48.320 --> 13:55.640]  the Syrians of course it was they don't even hide this stuff CNN you know we'll
[13:55.640 --> 13:59.120]  have a feed and actually go to the cut where the guys going are you ready for
[13:59.120 --> 14:02.280]  me the stage for shooting they're like oh hold on we'll go back to you in a
[14:02.280 --> 14:12.480]  moment I mean this is the stuff they do this is how dumb they think you are they
[14:12.480 --> 14:17.840]  do Sandy Hook feeds on blue screens they did they did that back in the first
[14:17.840 --> 14:22.280]  Gulf War claiming they were in Kuwait on rooftops and in Jerusalem on rooftops
[14:22.280 --> 14:26.880]  and didn't even change the set one day they're in Kuwait same set next day
[14:26.880 --> 14:31.720]  they're in Jerusalem same set with a fake palm tree and a blue screen behind
[14:31.720 --> 14:37.520]  them and then it's admitted it's fake it's all a big joke on you by an
[14:37.520 --> 14:43.400]  occupation force so I'm gonna get into all of these flyers and some of the past
[14:43.400 --> 14:48.480]  articles we've written about it because now the public's ready to hear it isn't
[14:48.480 --> 14:52.880]  just the federal government that's got 500 page documents out we're gonna be
[14:52.880 --> 14:58.520]  going over today and 230 page documents saying everything suspicious trust no
[14:58.520 --> 15:03.960]  one and anyone that even tries to report corruption is a terrorist how do you
[15:03.960 --> 15:09.520]  think they're going to have this takeover they arrest people that report
[15:09.520 --> 15:14.600]  illegal torturing and don't arrest the torturers they arrest people that
[15:14.600 --> 15:18.800]  report white slavery operations that sex slavery including children they
[15:18.800 --> 15:22.560]  arrest people that report millions missing here billions missing there in
[15:22.560 --> 15:29.760]  different federal bureaucracies it was 2.3 trillion missing the day before
[15:29.760 --> 15:36.120]  September 11th the Associated Press ran a report on that two trill plus missing
[15:36.120 --> 15:39.920]  over a decade gee you think there might be a little bit of corruption going on
[15:39.920 --> 15:46.920]  and just as our amazing insider Wayne Madsen said on this show five years ago
[15:46.920 --> 15:51.600]  the NSA is there to spy on the NSA and the rest of the government and all that
[15:51.600 --> 15:56.000]  we're seeing is the mainlining of the Stasi society and I've got to hear talk
[15:56.000 --> 15:59.880]  show host everywhere I monitored three different shows this morning actually
[15:59.880 --> 16:04.400]  four different shows technically I monitored four different shows this
[16:04.400 --> 16:07.880]  morning when I went for a jog and then when I did an errand and when I drove
[16:07.880 --> 16:16.560]  into work San Antonio Dallas and then two shows in Austin and the host were
[16:16.560 --> 16:21.400]  trying on all the shows to defend the government spying and almost all the
[16:21.400 --> 16:25.280]  callers were calling in saying this is a witch hunt they're persecuting people
[16:25.280 --> 16:31.320]  that blow the whistle Snowden's a hero this is because the government's been
[16:31.320 --> 16:35.120]  taken over by criminal interest this is like Soviet Russia this is like Nazi
[16:35.120 --> 16:38.680]  Germany you know why was it bad in those countries but why are we saying it's
[16:38.680 --> 16:44.440]  good exactly we've never had cops even with warrants stick their hands inside
[16:44.440 --> 16:50.800]  women on the side of the road we've never had them do it on top of it without
[16:50.800 --> 16:54.840]  warrants but they just say it's what we do now it's what we do now we've never
[16:54.840 --> 16:58.840]  had them with rubber stamped fake warrants or no warrants take blood on
[16:58.840 --> 17:01.840]  the side of the road but they do it now they're in our business they're in our
[17:01.840 --> 17:07.680]  lives I mean I see no exaggeration I was thinking about it probably five times
[17:07.680 --> 17:13.080]  the cops driving down the road that I saw when I was in college twice what I
[17:13.080 --> 17:16.440]  saw just a few years ago and man they're writing tickets there they're
[17:16.440 --> 17:20.040]  they're pulling over the truck drivers there because they're told you get this
[17:20.040 --> 17:27.120]  money in and now cops are paid like $100,000 in most cities I mean this
[17:27.120 --> 17:31.080]  there's not gonna be factory jobs there's not gonna be jobs there's gonna
[17:31.080 --> 17:35.520]  be jobs running the takedown of America and they're going to find people that
[17:35.520 --> 17:40.040]  want the power trip and who want the money and they're coming for us and
[17:40.040 --> 17:45.200]  they're not gonna stop you understand they've been training to kick in our
[17:45.200 --> 17:50.680]  doors and take our guns and take us to FEMA camps for a long long long time and
[17:50.680 --> 17:56.000]  now you're just seeing the mainlining of it but the good news is the people are
[17:56.000 --> 18:00.960]  waking up to this nightmare and we've got to awaken to just how horrible we've
[18:00.960 --> 18:08.040]  gotten and repent as a nation for all the whitewashing and rationalizing and
[18:08.040 --> 18:13.320]  excuses that that we put up with oh that's not really a baby well why was it

[24:49.520 --> 24:56.400]  will shut off the electricity and shut the water off and I just don't think the

[25:02.640 --> 25:06.560]  them I see the bars of the cage being built I know who the globalist are I've
[25:06.560 --> 25:10.320]  read their books I've read their publications I've shown them to you I've
[25:10.320 --> 25:14.440]  made award-winning films warning you and I mean I'm here telling you folks these
[25:14.440 --> 25:20.560]  are the people that wound up Hitler these people make add-off Alois Hitler

[25:26.800 --> 25:28.960]  that
[25:30.040 --> 25:35.200]  you know if someone kills you and takes 50 years of your life let's say if you
[25:35.200 --> 25:39.320]  were 25 or someone kills you a year before you were gonna die when you're
[25:39.320 --> 25:45.600]  76 years old it's still murder isn't it and they know what the bisphenol a does
[25:45.600 --> 25:50.520]  they know what the hydrofluorosalic acid does they know what all of it does to
[25:50.520 --> 25:58.200]  you on record they brag about it and it's taking in many of the numbers that
[25:58.200 --> 26:01.640]  are out there we've had medical doctors on broke down the Harvard studies you
[26:01.640 --> 26:09.200]  name it there's a cocktail of things 15 20 30 years DU they estimate takes about
[26:09.200 --> 26:14.120]  30 years off your life if you have moderate exposure light exposure 15 20
[26:14.120 --> 26:17.840]  years but you're gonna have debilitating lung problems kidney problems
[26:17.840 --> 26:24.200]  bladder problems it precipitates out in those areas that the former head of the
[26:24.200 --> 26:29.560]  army Pentagon DU program physicist and doctor on Dr. Doug Rokey over and over
[26:29.560 --> 26:36.800]  again about it and I just think about how they're murdering us and how it's
[26:36.800 --> 26:42.280]  real funny to them and the childlike public just pottles around as the evil
[26:42.280 --> 26:46.400]  is just rolled out and it's just publicly announced and we're all under a
[26:46.400 --> 26:50.160]  eugenics program that's incremental and it's so hard to resist something that's
[26:50.160 --> 26:55.360]  incremental and I sit here intellectually calmly knowing and studying
[26:55.360 --> 27:00.840]  this as they spray barium salts aluminum dioxide and radioactive isotopes on us
[27:00.840 --> 27:08.080]  and the Department of Energy geoengineering program is admitted is
[27:08.080 --> 27:14.080]  admitted but the details are classified and then you realize why I'm upset and
[27:14.080 --> 27:18.600]  that's why they want to be able to imprison an Air Force whistleblower we
[27:18.600 --> 27:24.280]  have on who comes on and says I was over toxic materials at this Air Force base
[27:24.280 --> 27:29.840]  and they list the Air Force base and there was tons of the different radio
[27:29.840 --> 27:34.240]  active isotopes and other things brought in exactly as the scientists have
[27:34.240 --> 27:40.960]  warned to be mixed with the jet fuel to be aerosolized and sprayed let's pull
[27:40.960 --> 27:44.920]  it surprise winning level stuff on the show with the documents and it's not
[27:44.920 --> 27:48.280]  even a news issue because I mean how was the mainstream media gonna cover
[27:48.280 --> 27:54.880]  something like that how are they going to cover that most the GMO food crops
[27:54.880 --> 28:00.200]  grow their own pesticide that kills lab animals that eat it and is designed to
[28:00.200 --> 28:06.440]  kill insects or the insects most insects won't even eat the BT corn and the BT
[28:06.440 --> 28:14.920]  other varieties and I know I've got stacks of news and I go right back to
[28:14.920 --> 28:19.520]  that because that's what's at the heart of all of this that's where all of this
[28:19.520 --> 28:27.920]  goes is this classically authoritarian society run by criminal offshore banks
[28:27.920 --> 28:33.120]  that are robbing all of us publicly and now grabbing private accounts and not
[28:33.120 --> 28:37.600]  even getting in trouble all over the world MF global here in the US and
[28:37.600 --> 28:45.000]  Europe oh yeah Cyprus and it's gonna get worse when we come back Adam Kokesh

[35:10.120 --> 35:14.360]  their home but there are rules for transporting those firearms and police
[35:14.360 --> 35:19.640]  say that Kokash what he did was illegal he could face up to five years in
[35:19.640 --> 35:23.840]  federal prison but again right now we're told that police are issuing a search
[35:23.840 --> 35:27.840]  warrant it's not clear whether they plan to take I thought we're whether they
[35:27.840 --> 35:32.100]  have so there is the foaming at the mouth media we actually have all the
[35:32.100 --> 35:38.000]  tales up at info wars.com the photos the videos everything sent to us by his
[35:38.000 --> 35:43.480]  crew we're gonna have pop in later in the next hour in fact the gentleman you
[35:43.480 --> 35:48.520]  saw that's one of his producers right there who was on the local news they're
[35:48.520 --> 35:55.200]  charging him they're saying with having a firearm with drugs being the devilish
[35:55.200 --> 36:02.000]  marijuana one of the few products the government does not ship in they ship in
[36:02.000 --> 36:05.920]  the heroin the cocaine they push the Ritalin class drugs the Prozac class
[36:05.920 --> 36:12.760]  drugs the Adderall speed you know the deadly synthetic speed and hallucinogens
[36:12.760 --> 36:18.120]  on your children 24-7 at the government brainwashing camps in between the days
[36:18.120 --> 36:22.440]  they have the kids come and learn how to cross dress at age 5 and learn how to
[36:22.440 --> 36:26.760]  perform oral sex at age 7 at the public schools are there at the pedophile
[36:26.760 --> 36:31.400]  training centers on record and then you have the pedophile training TV shows
[36:31.400 --> 36:36.560]  teaching the kids how to be sexual at age 5 as well but the pedophile forces
[36:36.560 --> 36:44.640]  are very very upset that you would have a slave in the district of evil dare to
[36:44.640 --> 36:50.000]  load a shotgun this is this is an abomination in land of the abortion
[36:50.000 --> 36:58.480]  home of the low IQ in the land of the surveilled home of the coward it is it
[36:58.480 --> 37:04.280]  is just blasphemy that he would dare do this so they reportedly had now more
[37:04.280 --> 37:07.720]  numbers are coming out first it was two helicopters and two armored vehicles now
[37:07.720 --> 37:12.560]  it's five armored vehicles over a hundred armed police two different federal
[37:12.560 --> 37:16.600]  agencies with their local minions following behind them worshiping them
[37:16.600 --> 37:21.920]  and kicking down the door throwing flashbangs on them then beating up
[37:21.920 --> 37:27.400]  co-cash and stomping around ransacking things because they all watch Hollywood
[37:27.400 --> 37:31.680]  movies and that's how the tough guys are in the new Hollywood movies CIA comes to
[37:31.680 --> 37:40.360]  your house and kills your kids and that's good so see they're normalizing it
[37:40.360 --> 37:44.680]  and every show is nothing but SWAT teams constantly rating everyone so that you
[37:44.680 --> 37:48.920]  just expect that like you don't go outside and see birds on the on the power line
[37:48.920 --> 37:53.440]  you go out and see SWAT teams and so it's just it's just what we do in America
[37:53.440 --> 37:58.120]  and then and we have the biggest prison population and all the rest of it so
[37:58.120 --> 38:04.440]  just imagine in the country where they abort a couple million babies a year
[38:04.440 --> 38:09.200]  including nine-month-old babies that you know they have trouble holding down
[38:09.200 --> 38:11.880]  while they chop them up with meat-glavers sorry if you don't want to hear that I
[38:11.880 --> 38:15.400]  mean that's that's what goes on cram them down toilets and sometimes they keep
[38:15.400 --> 38:19.560]  them alive and sell them for medical experiments by the way I told you a
[38:19.560 --> 38:24.360]  long time ago that when you go into the hospital in a car wreck and you go into
[38:24.360 --> 38:28.080]  the major hospitals especially big city run charity hospitals that are actually
[38:28.080 --> 38:32.400]  Rockefeller controlled most of them are my tax-free foundations are actually
[38:32.400 --> 38:37.320]  profit hospitals they call themselves charities you're dead the healthier you
[38:37.320 --> 38:43.480]  are they're going to do a blood test you're dead you're dead ABC news patient
[38:43.480 --> 38:47.520]  wakes up as doctors get ready to remove organs the nurses all said she's alive
[38:47.520 --> 38:51.920]  she's got response her brainwaves everything's fine she's got a drug
[38:51.920 --> 38:56.760]  overdose of prescription pills when he did minister charcoal but the heads of
[38:56.760 --> 39:05.040]  the hospital said no they said get them in there and get those organs my dad
[39:05.040 --> 39:09.400]  told me when I was 15 years old going and doing driver safety he said you don't
[39:09.400 --> 39:14.400]  sign that organ donor card and I said why dad my dad was an oral surgeon at
[39:14.400 --> 39:17.920]  Dennis and back then he would volunteer he got paid to do it but he would
[39:17.920 --> 39:22.800]  volunteer to be the guy to call the wire jaws at you know 3 a.m. after car wrecks
[39:22.800 --> 39:25.400]  and things and he worked in the biggest hospitals he just said I'm going to tell
[39:25.400 --> 39:31.000]  you this and I'm gonna leave it at this don't sign it you're healthy you're young
[39:31.000 --> 39:35.320]  if you go in there with any trying to trauma a lot of these hospitals will put
[39:35.320 --> 39:41.920]  you under and take your organs I told this story for 18 years on air and then
[39:41.920 --> 39:47.160]  it was probably I don't know five years later because we moved to Austin by then
[39:47.160 --> 39:50.240]  and I was visiting my grandparents I still there and eat dinner with them on
[39:50.240 --> 39:53.520]  Sunday I go to church with them sometimes to my grandmother would make me
[39:53.520 --> 39:57.920]  dinner every Sunday even on the top of nerd you know terrorist square you know
[39:57.920 --> 40:02.640]  go eat with grandma and we watched 60 minutes where they admitted hospitals in
[40:02.640 --> 40:08.640]  Dallas in and Chicago were killing people in assembly lines to get their
[40:08.640 --> 40:12.280]  organs and here's just another one and of course this is a whitewash too it's
[40:12.280 --> 40:18.520]  like the feds are investigating and it's all because the nurse nurses through
[40:18.520 --> 40:21.960]  feds and blew the whistle so now the feds are going we were just going to check
[40:21.960 --> 40:25.880]  the bioethics procedures and why the mistake was made they're there wink
[40:25.880 --> 40:33.280]  wink good job doctors wink wink we're here to find out why this happened and
[40:33.280 --> 40:37.360]  of course it's come out in Austin four or five times I remember in the last
[40:37.360 --> 40:42.480]  decade that they kill you at these hospitals and they they they take
[40:42.480 --> 40:47.280]  everything in fact a lot of times they'll try to keep you alive quietly
[40:47.280 --> 40:50.480]  while they're busy selling off different parts that's how they got caught
[40:50.480 --> 40:56.960]  last time and just like most the foods fake most the meat isn't beef most the
[40:56.960 --> 41:02.680]  fish isn't even fish it's all fake it's all fraud it's all lies we've decided to
[41:02.680 --> 41:09.560]  go into a criminal culture and so we're gonna collapse that's how it works when
[41:09.560 --> 41:13.560]  the radiation clouds that are still raining down on us from Japan the trade
[41:13.560 --> 41:18.400]  winds blow right across as well as the jet stream above it they just raised the
[41:18.400 --> 41:24.560]  level of the isotopes between 25 and 20 plus thousand times depending on the
[41:24.560 --> 41:31.800]  isotope look it up at the environmental protection agency oh by the way speaking
[41:31.800 --> 41:37.840]  of that Fukushima boss hailed as hero dies
[41:38.680 --> 41:45.520]  my soul Yoshida who led the 50 man suicide team as they were called and to
[41:45.520 --> 41:50.760]  try to dump concrete no things in on top of the gas clouds so that it wouldn't
[41:50.760 --> 41:55.360]  rain down on us well he never got thanks here in America because they wouldn't
[41:55.360 --> 41:58.840]  even admit radiation clouds were coming down he had most his team have now died
[41:58.840 --> 42:06.400]  two years later and he died yesterday but hey you know what and cultures said
[42:06.400 --> 42:11.440]  the Japanese that radiations good for you they should be thankful I told Ann
[42:11.440 --> 42:18.480]  hey honey why don't you go over there and and and volunteer you know to go in
[42:18.480 --> 42:23.280]  there and wallow around in the plutonium reactor the most deadly type there is the
[42:23.280 --> 42:32.360]  most most nauseous and of course all over Japan children are dropping dead
[42:32.360 --> 42:37.680]  because it'll cause a cardiac response basically where children go around first
[42:37.680 --> 42:42.560]  their their gums bleed they bleed out of their intestines and then they go to
[42:42.560 --> 42:46.160]  the doctors and they keep it quiet and say yes probably radiation poisoning the
[42:46.160 --> 42:49.640]  butterflies are dying the bees are dying the birds are dying all over the
[42:49.640 --> 42:53.560]  country in many areas and the children are dropping dead all over the country
[42:53.560 --> 42:56.680]  because they've got youth on their side they finally just dropped out of art
[42:56.680 --> 43:00.360]  attacks and so what if your teeth are falling out and blood's coming out I
[43:00.360 --> 43:07.000]  mean it's loving you ought to be thankful like and culture said that's the
[43:07.000 --> 43:12.880]  New World Order spirit right there the Japanese on a page general electric
[43:12.880 --> 43:20.280]  billions of dollars for the gift of the fountain of youth the five reactors that
[43:20.280 --> 43:25.200]  blew up or partially blew up and that are still smoking deadly plutonium
[43:25.200 --> 43:29.040]  uranium particles into the atmosphere that are being picked up by other
[43:29.040 --> 43:34.240]  particular and brought over here as little little hot particle gifts because
[43:34.240 --> 43:37.600]  the background radiation that was already double in the northern hemisphere
[43:37.600 --> 43:41.040]  from all the nuclear testing now they say it's doubled again you can look look
[43:41.040 --> 43:45.640]  that up it's doubled again since Fukushima that is by some comparisons
[43:45.640 --> 43:51.520]  between 70 and 100 it varies but top nuclear physicists we've had on 70 a
[43:51.520 --> 43:57.040]  hundred times what happened at Chernobyl why not I mean the radiation of D use
[43:57.040 --> 44:01.200]  good for the troops the army wouldn't allow it to be used prior 1990 but see a
[44:01.200 --> 44:08.640]  magic trendy wand was waved fluorides good for you D use good for you
[44:08.640 --> 44:16.160]  uranium's good for you plutonium's good for you that's why they add it to the
[44:16.160 --> 44:20.200]  water supplies in most water districts you don't just get fluoride you get
[44:20.200 --> 44:27.040]  hundreds of other things like lead mercury arsenic radon scale all these
[44:27.040 --> 44:32.840]  other uranium all these other goodies and these are goodies it's fun to start
[44:32.840 --> 44:37.160]  bleeding you're in your urine and go in and learn you got a big tumor in your
[44:37.160 --> 44:42.480]  kidney or in your in your bladder and to go and have it chopped out and go
[44:42.480 --> 44:45.920]  through two years of chemotherapy and surgeries and then die and go into a
[44:45.920 --> 44:52.200]  coffin it's fun party time it's fun to have the NSA spying on us party time
[44:52.200 --> 44:57.200]  it's fun to have over a hundred federal troops and four or five armored vehicles
[44:57.200 --> 45:01.160]  and two helicopters go in and and co-cash was reportedly sitting on the
[45:01.160 --> 45:05.440]  couch after an hour of them tearing it apart and asked to be able to urinate so
[45:05.440 --> 45:10.000]  they punched him in the face and then kicked him to the floor good good I
[45:10.000 --> 45:13.960]  mean that's what you do in Fallujah that's what co-cash witnessed in Fallujah was
[45:13.960 --> 45:20.360]  killing civilians as well as what made him wake up how dare him how dare line
[45:20.360 --> 45:25.200]  him up like an Iraqi and splatter his guts all over the wall whoo this is the
[45:25.200 --> 45:32.520]  time of evil abort babies partial birth yeah yeah bless us with radiation
[45:32.520 --> 45:37.520]  bless us bless us in the world order we love the curses thank you what they
[45:37.520 --> 45:42.120]  chant hundreds of Democrats down at the Capitol from different angles as pro
[45:42.120 --> 45:46.480]  lifers had their designated time in the open rotunda to pray they've they've
[45:46.480 --> 45:50.720]  they chanted hail Satan and ran around in circles with with their tongues
[45:50.720 --> 45:55.440]  hanging out and watch the video just tongues hanging out saying hail Satan
[45:55.440 --> 45:59.080]  and let me tell you something Satan hears your prayers and it's gonna rip
[45:59.080 --> 46:03.000]  your guts out and just torture you and drag you through the dirt a hundred
[46:03.000 --> 46:06.400]  times worse than you've done the innocent because God will just step back
[46:06.400 --> 46:12.920]  okay you want Satan here have your devil have your devil enjoy it I hope you
[46:12.920 --> 46:23.560]  like it because God says vengeance is mine and the wicked beg to be torn limb
[46:23.560 --> 46:29.560]  from limb they beg to die slowly and you will you will die miserable horrible
[46:29.560 --> 46:35.000]  painful deaths in your deceit USA give me some USA or is that some of their
[46:35.000 --> 46:38.960]  hail Satan chanting yes you're gonna trust the system and go to it as they
[46:38.960 --> 46:43.560]  kill you slowly and suck everything out of you
[46:48.840 --> 46:52.200]  do you hear that that's not even one of the really good ones we got like five
[46:52.200 --> 46:55.160]  in there you got them where they run right up to the camera and say hail
[46:55.160 --> 46:58.560]  Satan gotta listen carefully and watch their mouths as they ring around the
[46:58.560 --> 47:02.040]  Christians saying the hell Satan will we'll cue that up there in a break get
[47:02.040 --> 47:05.480]  the wine what happens is we loaded it with a bunch of bad ones and I went out
[47:05.480 --> 47:10.960]  yesterday and we found the good one but continuing here oh oh you do have some
[47:10.960 --> 47:15.320]  of the more more audible ones like well sure let's play play that little jewel
[47:15.320 --> 47:20.640]  then for people look at those evil Christians praying lovingly and
[47:20.640 --> 47:31.160]  compassionately for children oh and they're ringed by people saying hail Satan
[47:31.160 --> 47:35.360]  and then she runs into the camera through the police with her tongue hanging
[47:35.360 --> 47:50.600]  out hear him hail Satan hail Satan hail Satan oh man I tell you
[47:50.600 --> 47:57.680]  who don't want to be her that's all I can say wow these people talk about it do
[47:57.680 --> 48:00.840]  I see them on YouTube never we're going I love it I love the evil that's gonna
[48:00.840 --> 48:08.360]  happen okay well yes you have it coming there and you know what I'm here to do
[48:08.360 --> 48:13.320]  is to try to shock you with the reality of what we're going through here
[48:13.320 --> 48:17.400]  because this is how evil works people get into a normalcy bias where they will
[48:17.400 --> 48:22.240]  put up with anything and I'm here desperately trying to awaken the
[48:22.240 --> 48:30.400]  sleeping giant going wake up wake up wake up this is not good do the DC
[48:30.400 --> 48:33.840]  police go and gangbangers every day rob and shoot people know they have one of
[48:33.840 --> 48:37.880]  the highest crime rates in the world are people safe in Mexico where they've
[48:37.880 --> 48:45.880]  taken all the guns the answer is no it has the highest crime rate for a country
[48:45.880 --> 48:51.000]  in the world we have a few cities that beat them per capita Chicago DC where
[48:51.000 --> 48:55.520]  you have the police dressed up like Latin American dictators you know in these
[48:55.520 --> 49:03.240]  fancy military outfits they look like North Korean dictator outfits all with
[49:03.240 --> 49:08.720]  their weapons their helicopters their tanks freaking out if a slave dare load
[49:08.720 --> 49:13.480]  a shotgun I mean just think about what these people are doing to all of us
[49:13.480 --> 49:20.600]  think about how pathetic as a culture we've gotten and admit that it's wrong
[49:20.600 --> 49:26.880]  oh Adam Kokesh has been charged with possessing hallucinogenic mushrooms oh
[49:26.880 --> 49:35.160]  how horrible how evil and who knows if it's even true and then that's how
[49:35.160 --> 49:41.480]  they're getting the gun charge on Adam Kokesh hallucinogenic mushrooms and
[49:41.480 --> 49:47.200]  Mary wanna but if you want to give little kids at age to pros act type drugs
[49:47.200 --> 49:51.920]  and antipsychotics that are according to every medical doctor we've talked to
[49:51.920 --> 49:57.080]  much more serious than even mushrooms well then that's a good humanitarian
[49:57.080 --> 50:00.520]  thing to do because that's something controlled by the big pharmaceutical
[50:00.520 --> 50:06.080]  companies the same ones that put HIV and hepatitis in the blood products for
[50:06.080 --> 50:10.800]  you and your family again just look at the legions of examples of secret
[50:10.800 --> 50:15.120]  testing all the rest of it when we come back though when we come back you know as
[50:15.120 --> 50:20.000]  I promised I'm going to get into the government openly announcing the spy
[50:20.000 --> 50:23.720]  state telling the feds to all spy on each other does somebody take vacations
[50:23.720 --> 50:28.680]  does somebody volunteer for jobs oh yeah that's a sure time I thought that's a
[50:28.680 --> 50:33.400]  sign for promotion well the federal government that's that's not that that's
[50:33.400 --> 50:37.880]  a sign you're a you're an extremist but but then why is everybody upset the big
[50:37.880 --> 50:43.960]  next national news story people finally had their conscience shot by this is the
[50:43.960 --> 50:47.800]  hundreds of FBI training fliers that we've written about where they say
[50:47.800 --> 50:54.440]  paying for coffee with cash is an act of suspicious pro-terrorism behavior or
[50:54.440 --> 50:58.440]  wearing blue jeans so we're gonna put those articles back out hopefully what's
[50:58.440 --> 51:06.400]  the people up jump to you time and time again you need to come here and help us
[51:06.400 --> 51:12.120]  we need assistance please those we should be able to depend on let us down
[51:12.120 --> 51:16.560]  federal and state and local officials saying help is on the way well the
[51:16.560 --> 51:21.040]  folks here in bell harbor say show me don't depend on the government to save

[01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:43.920]  going to have one of the producers of Adam Kokesh's show who was a witness to

[01:00:55.880 --> 01:01:02.920]  settle down it gets me so upset when I see the feds come out and sort of read
[01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:06.040]  in the training manual today I saw the article yesterday in McClatchy and
[01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:10.640]  barely mentioned it and then now it's a big story today all over the place that
[01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:16.120]  they're they're saying we're looking for the threat within the threat within is
[01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:20.080]  the new world order the threat within is the offshore banks that have wrecked
[01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:25.120]  the entire world Africa Eastern Europe Asia Latin America they're the ones on
[01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:29.280]  record that will assassinate leaders if they don't bankrupt the country and
[01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:33.280]  impoverish the people so the globalists can buy everything up cheap and they use
[01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:38.800]  poverty as a political tool this is an anti-renaissance anti-enlightenment
[01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:46.320]  anti-human abomination of neo feudalistic bull and it just absolutely
[01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:54.200]  drives me crazy to watch a bunch of technocrats running scientific criminal
[01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:58.840]  operations that are still pretty simple though and to know I'm right to know
[01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:02.080]  what's happening that everything we've said confirmed in quadruplicate
[01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:10.320]  triplicate quintuplicate and to just realize the pattern of history and to
[01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:17.320]  be locked into it knowing we're all on a runaway express train into
[01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:29.800]  political hell Hades Mordor Nazi Germany Soviet Russia Maoist China man
[01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:35.960]  there this is a conscious plan there's a reason in all those countries they did
[01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:39.320]  what they did the globalists funded the new world order Rothschild Rockefeller
[01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:42.640]  banks on record there's been congressional hearings on this look them up
[01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:47.400]  the church committees just I just named them for you that's selling books by
[01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:55.800]  Anthony Sutton who was there working in the committees they tried it here the
[01:02:55.800 --> 01:03:01.120]  McCormick-Dickstein committee exposed that they want a fascist takeover they
[01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:05.800]  do not like you living wealthily they don't like you living at all and and
[01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:12.240]  look you're either gonna get this or we're done the way they sell going under
[01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:15.920]  carbon taxes is some great right and people are getting off on the austerity
[01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:20.480]  the way they sell abortion as it's some great right and women have had them and
[01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:24.320]  men have paid for them so people rationalize to themselves I'm not even
[01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:28.840]  judging you you were lied to you grew up in a culture of evil you were told it
[01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:31.880]  was okay to take your kid to the top of the pyramid and sacrifice him or take
[01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:35.760]  him to the top of the altar and throw him into bail throw him before Molek you
[01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:39.720]  eat every call you were told to take your child with a bonfire in front of the
[01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:43.080]  stone obelisk and throw your kid into a fire believing it would it would make
[01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:46.600]  fertility come back and the fields because your other three kids are
[01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:51.480]  starving yeah I'm speaking to people's ancestors out there that you all of us
[01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:56.680]  are connected them all of our ancestors murdered their own children under
[01:03:56.680 --> 01:04:03.120]  state orders and this is a sacrament I've always told you the abortion for the
[01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:12.880]  inner adherence for the adepts is a holy sacrament of evil and it's come out in a
[01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:16.560]  lot of abortion clinics just type in abortion clinic was site of satanic
[01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:23.560]  rituals or abortionist you know was a Satanist of course they are not all of
[01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:27.480]  them the ones that are doing it you know when it's in the first trimester that's
[01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:31.880]  that's that's a whole nother issue folks to second and third trimester and
[01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:35.000]  people get mad say I don't want to hear this well listen that's because your
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:39.480]  conscience doesn't want to hear it and then you have them standing chanting
[01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:45.280]  Hail Satan around pro-lawyers at the Capitol licking their demonic lips
[01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:48.080]  because that's how evil works deep down they know it's wrong they've had
[01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:51.880]  abortions and so now they're just gonna go to the only spirit that tells them
[01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:55.920]  it's okay and at least they're being honest at least they now have embraced

[01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:58.040]  to use DU that is a death sentence in the army's own pre-1990 manual we've
[01:08:58.040 --> 01:09:02.440]  aborted 53 million babies plus we allow partial birth abortion of babies that
[01:09:02.440 --> 01:09:08.840]  are nine months old ready for adoption we buy Pepsi products that have fetal
[01:09:08.840 --> 01:09:13.040]  tissue in them I mean there's just thousands of insane things our
[01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:17.960]  government orders torture worldwide illegally it is a felony and then when
[01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:22.640]  a whistleblower at the CIA talks about it he's serving a jail sentence right
[01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:29.600]  now and the people that tortured are given medals the crimes are legion upon
[01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:34.560]  legion upon legion and in the federal government there are a lot of good
[01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:38.560]  people that are waking up the military's waking up local police are waking up the
[01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:42.320]  numbers all show that new polls out today saying the vast majority of
[01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:47.560]  Americans believe Snowden's a hero in a scientific poll despite the
[01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:51.520]  demonization that's what I'm hearing on talk radio everywhere as the hosts say
[01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:56.560]  oh no he he's whoa he's put us open to to terrorists people are like our
[01:09:56.560 --> 01:10:00.840]  government runs the terrorist in Libyan Syria and people see through this
[01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:06.480]  announcement of the threat within program that McClatchy exposed yesterday
[01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:10.720]  this is now the biggest story out there because people are reading the 400 plus
[01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:13.880]  page manual there's a 200 plus page manual and I've been reading through
[01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:19.800]  this and it's do they go on vacation do they volunteer happily to courier
[01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:23.920]  stuff do they do they have you it's the same thing and then I have these FBI
[01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:28.200]  training manuals and I'm gonna get to after we cover what happened to Adam
[01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:36.000]  co-cash where it shows that buying a coffee with cash they say call the FBI
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:40.280]  on you so it's not just the feds saying spy on each other it's a witch hunt
[01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:45.320]  against citizens where everybody's a suspect with no evidence and nobody has
[01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:49.760]  any rights but the higher level feds who work for offshore banks that are
[01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:55.640]  looting us this is the takeover and again I'll say this and then go to our
[01:10:55.640 --> 01:11:03.200]  guest research France Kettler did not really take over France but it was a
[01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:07.280]  big embarrassing thing for the French so the media kind of played along with
[01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:10.960]  limited British resistance in the expeditionary force that fled to the
[01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:16.160]  sea at Dunkirk there was no French occupation that's why a week after the
[01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:22.160]  invasion Hitler was in Paris and could drive past the imagine if Hitler took
[01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:27.400]  over America in a week and then he paraded down New York with the streets
[01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:33.960]  lined with half the public Highling Hitler did you know that go watch the
[01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:39.360]  film footage of Hitler because the there was a criminal group in the French
[01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:43.600]  government the police and military that had already made a deal for him to act
[01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:48.360]  like he invaded they stood down and then he took over and de Gaulle fled with
[01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:53.920]  the British now that's what this is is a corporate takeover through homeland
[01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:58.800]  security through DHS through these grids saying people that are against the New
[01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:03.320]  World Order and say that foreign banks run us are terrorist and that we're
[01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:07.680]  gonna blow stuff up no the banks are gonna blow stuff up the same ones that
[01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:11.560]  run the narcotics and launder the drug money on record and then blame it on us
[01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:16.240]  America has been hijacked and now they're ready for the crackdown the
[01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:20.080]  night of the long knives the purge in the federal government that
[01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:25.280]  authoritarians Nazis Soviets it doesn't matter always do once they first taken
[01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:31.000]  over then they go after everybody in the government and you could be somebody
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:35.000]  that goes along but they know isn't a criminal they're gonna burn you your
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:39.600]  only chance is to start speaking out these are to stop whistleblowers of
[01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:44.760]  criminal activity now I'm done talking about that until we talk to our guests
[01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:47.600]  I'm gonna get back into it and open the phones up and take your phone calls and
[01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:51.400]  we got Chuck D a public enemy coming on to talk about the most powerful force in
[01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:57.600]  the world and a lot more today but but we do have Lucas Joule outside the
[01:12:57.600 --> 01:13:01.120]  courthouse he had to come out of the courthouse to do this Adam Kokesh is
[01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:05.240]  manager of their media operation and involved in production the number one
[01:13:05.240 --> 01:13:10.960]  eyewitness to what happened literally literally we aired this interview that
[01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:14.000]  was taped right before showtime some some nights in force not only news is live
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:18.040]  some nights of tape right before we did the interview got it edited you know
[01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:23.120]  into the main news show that had already been taped streamed it out to
[01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:28.880]  everybody on prison planet TV while it was streaming he was being rated and so
[01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:32.760]  it's the last interview it's up on info wars calm it's up on drudge report
[01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:37.840]  calm we thankful to drudge for carrying real media on this with the photos that
[01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:42.560]  Lucas and his associates and Adam versus the man calm took and and so to tell you
[01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:47.000]  what really happened this is unprecedented multiple armored vehicles
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:52.120]  I reported like a hundred feds and locals two helicopters shutting down the
[01:13:52.120 --> 01:13:57.240]  neighborhood any excuse to bring in micro martial law just like Boston which
[01:13:57.240 --> 01:14:03.600]  you now saw nationwide exercise on July 4th helicopter flyers flyovers you
[01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:08.200]  name it this is amazing and regardless of what you think of Adam Kokesh on some
[01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:12.440]  of his political views or ideas he had courage like Rosa parts and I admire
[01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:18.760]  courage okay I think Adam's cocky he's a combat veteran of Fallujah you know I
[01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:23.040]  think you know that a lot of things but it doesn't matter I think sometimes he
[01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:27.040]  talks down to me it doesn't matter folks he's got guts and guts is enough and
[01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:31.320]  that that thing has been thrown out by the Supreme Court four and a half years
[01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:35.560]  ago DC versus Haller it's unconstitutional and if a citizen can't
[01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:41.160]  load a shotgun in the middle of DC it's such a joke now would they sin for a
[01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:45.880]  regular criminal helicopters and armored vehicles and a hundred armed storm
[01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:52.680]  troopers no it's the act of defiance of a citizen doing what he did like Rosa
[01:14:52.680 --> 01:14:56.840]  Park sitting at the front of the bus you have got to admire it does it mean I
[01:14:56.840 --> 01:15:02.440]  agree with all his ideas no but that's done now folks you've got to stand with
[01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:06.280]  Adam you've got to stand with people that have this type of courage does it
[01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:10.280]  mean that I would have done this probably not I picked my battles but he
[01:15:10.280 --> 01:15:14.040]  picked his he knew what was gonna happen to him to make a big issue out of this
[01:15:14.040 --> 01:15:18.360]  that this is an overthrown law but those criminals are saying he doesn't have a
[01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:21.440]  right to protect himself but the criminals in government are armed to the
[01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:27.800]  teeth Lucas Jewel outside the federal courthouse a breakdown exactly what
[01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:31.200]  happened you were there talk about what happened you've got the floor thank you
[01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:35.800]  for joining us yes Alex can you hear me yes sir and again for those that don't
[01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:40.440]  know articles on the site he went and and loaded a shotgun is one man armed to
[01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:45.000]  march open carry it's legal in Virginia but not in the district of occupied
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:50.800]  criminals go ahead sir yes I was actually present during the raid my room
[01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:57.120]  is right by the front door heard some loud bangs on the door and I grabbed my
[01:15:57.120 --> 01:16:02.240]  girlfriend and started to run to the back door because anyone banging like
[01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:08.000]  that on the door can't be friendly so with the back door and by then we had
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:15.640]  SWAT team members decked out in full armor battle helmet everything surrounding
[01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:23.240]  us and so then we were placed in plexigraf still at gunpoint the entire
[01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:27.320]  time we're any cuff we've been searched we've been petted down we're still at
[01:16:27.320 --> 01:16:33.720]  gunpoint it was really it was really unnecessary and you know one of the
[01:16:33.720 --> 01:16:38.400]  officers kicked at him after he asked you bathroom they wouldn't present the
[01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:45.400]  warrant before the now again that's a major civil rights violation I described
[01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:50.600]  what happened to Adam well Adam was separated from well Adam was originally
[01:16:50.600 --> 01:16:55.000]  with us we were we were all in this front room Adam was originally with us they
[01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:59.760]  drug them into the room and we have audio that unfortunately my phone better
[01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:06.040]  used to load the video but we have audio of us in that room and then they pull
[01:17:06.040 --> 01:17:10.160]  Adam out of the room and have him to the side but we could still see him like
[01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:15.400]  to the side of the door and Adam asked us to use that use the bathroom the
[01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:20.200]  officer kicked him Adam's girlfriend was actually in the shower at the time and
[01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:25.840]  it's her time of the month so she was asking you know hey can I go handle this
[01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:30.920]  and off the officer said no she said hey I'm bleeding all over myself can I
[01:17:30.920 --> 01:17:35.880]  please use the bathroom at night but you stand a pool of own blood for about
[01:17:35.880 --> 01:17:40.360]  three hours well see the dehumanization of the slave is key and they like to
[01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:44.080]  spend broadcast here to teach you your dog meat your nobody you're their food
[01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:49.640]  they're coming and so now where did he kick him how did he kick him what was
[01:17:49.640 --> 01:17:53.120]  the bearing where these guys really getting off on on how cowardly and weak
[01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:58.240]  they are oh they were they were really getting off on it it was it was so weird
[01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:05.960]  to me that the detective who was running the show was the most civil one and then
[01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:11.680]  all these you know bronze dressed up in these silly costumes well no these are
[01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:15.240]  guys that want to be soldiers but but but now get to pick on you know women at
[01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:18.680]  checkpoints this is this is funny you know it's the funny part is I'm a
[01:18:18.680 --> 01:18:22.280]  veteran I was like do you know how many know their experience like you don't have
[01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:25.720]  any shame and what you're doing it's really about taking the constitutional
[01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:30.000]  it doesn't mean anything to you and I mean we were held in detention for five
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:34.240]  hours now describe how they kicked him I mean how hard did they kick him what
[01:18:34.240 --> 01:18:40.080]  happened well originally the cop that kicked them was starting everyone else
[01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:46.560]  and then I guess he got tired of hearing us talk trash to him so he went to go
[01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:53.240]  right at him and Adam asked him to you know beat the bathroom is a stalker
[01:18:53.240 --> 01:19:01.840]  kick to the solar plug so I'll kick him in the stomach yeah what a tough guy
[01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:07.200]  kicking somebody in the stomach was in handcuffs what a man what a big tough man
[01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:16.440]  well he's so tough the whole time I was in I was in Mexico and you know by the way when we take this
[01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:20.120]  country back anybody that serve the new world order willingly you're gonna have

[01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:32.200]  him high in the street but you know before in your in your introduction you
[01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:37.360]  were calling Adam talkie and everything I said but name a combat marine that isn't
[01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:44.040]  talking no no I hear you I'm saying I'm saying it's easy to hold on I gotta go

[01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:50.920]  saying it isn't about personalities it isn't about things the point is he had
[01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:56.500]  a lot of courage to do this and this is the point we've gotten to when you look
[01:19:56.500 --> 01:20:01.600]  into the eyes of these goons you just know how pathetic they are we all know

[01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:20.520]  authoritarian government not only can we just say that what they've done in DC is
[01:24:20.520 --> 01:24:25.440]  unconstitutional in Chicago for almost five years Chicago and DC have been
[01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:29.520]  ordered by the federal courts to get rid of their own constitutional laws
[01:24:29.520 --> 01:24:33.960]  they're net they're never going to unless we make them and so Adam has
[01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:38.640]  forced this and Lucas Jewel head of his media operation who was there during all
[01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:43.120]  of this is out front the courthouse during the break he was talking to NBC
[01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:47.080]  News and National and with a bunch of other local stages let's see if we can
[01:24:47.080 --> 01:24:51.800]  go back to him so we can hear it over the cell phone Lucas can we get back with
[01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:54.520]  you are you still talking to the media
[01:24:54.520 --> 01:25:00.200]  this is this is another representative for him okay great who is no that's fine
[01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:09.840]  who was this oh you were present when it occurred what you were you I'm told
[01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:13.400]  people were putting handcuffs and they continued to point their guns at your
[01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:18.600]  heads yeah three three people were handcuffed outside and the rest of us
[01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:24.720]  were putting this size I guess you could call them that's that's handcuffed you know sure yeah
[01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:32.720]  yeah and yeah we were we were stormed by a plot team park park rangers and they
[01:25:32.720 --> 01:25:38.080]  had guns loaded and at one point kind of in corner we were all hurled into a
[01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:43.960]  room and at one point the gun one of the men one of the park rangers was in the
[01:25:43.960 --> 01:25:47.960]  corner of the room and we're quite concerned about where the gun was
[01:25:47.960 --> 01:25:53.120]  pointed and then Adam's girlfriend were told was left naked and bleeding on the
[01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:57.760]  ground for three hours well she she was able to put some clothing on before she
[01:25:57.760 --> 01:26:01.440]  came down the stairs but it was really like a skirt that she was able to pull
[01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:05.640]  up over herself and had just gotten out of the shower but was able to secure the
[01:26:05.640 --> 01:26:09.400]  dog in you know in a well that's a good thing they didn't kill the dogs you
[01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:14.280]  know now we see varying reports two helicopters two vehicles four armored
[01:26:14.280 --> 01:26:19.400]  vehicles a hundred police how much force did the Imperial New World Order bring
[01:26:19.400 --> 01:26:24.000]  the bear it was all forced I mean there was a bang bang at the door and then
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:30.800]  followed by a breaking the door down with a flash grenade I'd never seen that
[01:26:30.800 --> 01:26:35.480]  before so that was new for me was that almost instantaneous yeah it was it
[01:26:35.480 --> 01:26:38.960]  absolutely was it absolutely was so they didn't give you a chance to open the
[01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:42.040]  door it's bang bang and then the flashbang comes in yeah we didn't get a
[01:26:42.040 --> 01:26:45.480]  chance to open the door I mean that the post in the home is between everyone
[01:26:45.480 --> 01:26:49.360]  feels it's between 15 and 30 seconds but I felt like it was much quicker than
[01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:54.560]  that but this was a real new situation for myself so you know kind of hard to
[01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:58.120]  do they do all the gorilla behavior saying get on the ground and then jumping
[01:26:58.120 --> 01:27:02.400]  on people with their knees yeah I mean we were we were we were in the room
[01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:07.640]  closest to the door myself and move the stool and we ran through the room into
[01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:11.880]  the kitchen and by that point the grenade had gone off the flash had gone off I
[01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:16.280]  had no idea what was occurring and we just we just dropped to the ground I
[01:27:16.280 --> 01:27:20.640]  mean we didn't know if we were going to be shot or arrested or we didn't know
[01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:23.720]  who was coming into the home quite frankly at that point so we're you know
[01:27:23.720 --> 01:27:28.680]  myself and Lucas you were on the ground in the kitchen face down hands out so
[01:27:28.680 --> 01:27:32.960]  that they could see that we had no weapons on us I had a cell phone in my
[01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:36.840]  pocket I let them know that so that if they were going to pat me down they
[01:27:36.840 --> 01:27:42.840]  wouldn't assume it was a weapon how long did this how long did this go on oh it
[01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:51.000]  was five hours at a minimum I mean they came in between 745 and 8 810 I tried
[01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:56.680]  to look at my phone but here's Lucas hang on thank you very much all right so I
[01:27:56.680 --> 01:27:59.440]  guess you had a lawyer there with you that was a nice lady who went through
[01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:03.400]  all this were you guys expecting this that night because it turns out the
[01:28:03.400 --> 01:28:11.480]  meat mm-hmm oh no she's actually a personal friend of mine and she was just
[01:28:11.480 --> 01:28:18.760]  over visiting and listen we've only got a few minutes in this segment what is it
[01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:23.280]  you need to impart to people about what's happened where is Adam now Adam
[01:28:23.280 --> 01:28:28.640]  Adam is in the adult detention center in Fairfax County Virginia the important
[01:28:28.640 --> 01:28:34.840]  message to relate to the people is that you do not own yourself in this country
[01:28:34.840 --> 01:28:41.800]  according to the government Adam did Adam's alleged crime armed no one Adam
[01:28:41.800 --> 01:28:48.320]  is a nonviolent person Adam is a peaceful person and it's very ridiculous that
[01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:52.200]  they would try to trump up something like this for victim of crime and notice
[01:28:52.200 --> 01:28:56.600]  that the charges have nothing to do with what happened in DC but yet parks police
[01:28:56.600 --> 01:29:01.640]  are who rated us you know so we're rated outside of the district of criminals
[01:29:01.640 --> 01:29:07.760]  in Herndon but yet park police raised us and then none of the charges have
[01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:13.120]  anything to do with the video and when the video was allegedly filmed on park
[01:29:13.120 --> 01:29:19.000]  police yes another trying to charging for marijuana and mushrooms no not for
[01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:24.240]  the marijuana just a possession of a schedule one or two we're gonna charge
[01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:28.680]  for the mushrooms and then they're gonna charge for possession of a firearm and
[01:29:28.680 --> 01:29:33.240]  schedule one or two that was a short segment I know you got media there three
[01:29:33.240 --> 01:29:37.080]  minutes I want to come back and a few more questions for you Lucas Jules stay
[01:29:37.080 --> 01:29:41.920]  there Anna versus the man calm and again this is a big civil rights issue that's
[01:29:41.920 --> 01:29:47.720]  happening here the Imperials get very angry over a slave with a weapon the
[01:29:47.720 --> 01:29:51.760]  great crime is a slave defending themselves we're on the March the
[01:29:51.760 --> 01:29:58.800]  empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[01:33:21.720 --> 01:33:27.200]  sooner or later gotta cut you down imagine park police want teams out of
[01:33:27.200 --> 01:33:32.720]  their jurisdiction with armored vehicles helicopters the news media shows up
[01:33:32.720 --> 01:33:40.120]  right before it happens they gotta get an American that dares in Washington DC
[01:33:40.120 --> 01:33:45.520]  named after George Washington he would dare load a shotgun when for five years
[01:33:45.520 --> 01:33:49.040]  four and a half years they have illegally it's almost five actually they
[01:33:49.040 --> 01:33:54.320]  have illegally the Supreme Court said okay you gotta love people have shotguns
[01:33:54.320 --> 01:33:56.920]  and rifles and handguns they gotta be able to have to defend themselves they
[01:33:56.920 --> 01:34:00.360]  gotta be able to have them loaded those cases people not being able to have a
[01:34:00.360 --> 01:34:06.000]  firearm to defend themselves and they said we're gonna go after him we're
[01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:09.280]  gonna make an example of him and I've got David Knight in here to give us an
[01:34:09.280 --> 01:34:14.080]  update on the Paul Revere contest in a moment people been asking about that but
[01:34:14.080 --> 01:34:19.040]  first off going back to Lucas Joule who was there during this I want to get into
[01:34:19.040 --> 01:34:22.760]  this jurisdictional issue with you and again how many armored vehicles how many
[01:34:22.760 --> 01:34:29.160]  helicopters because the media is varying two vehicles five armored vehicles
[01:34:29.160 --> 01:34:34.160]  two helicopters three helicopters a hundred police you've been at the
[01:34:34.160 --> 01:34:38.080]  courthouse you've been there what's happening with that you've got the floor
[01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:43.480]  for five minutes so tell people what's happening you know Alex I did think it
[01:34:43.480 --> 01:34:48.920]  was kind of weird how the media knew about it before we did well I guess
[01:34:48.920 --> 01:34:55.000]  they're going with the tactic of surprise but yeah so that was that was
[01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:58.520]  weird there was helicopters the media is embedded in the domestic anti-liberty
[01:34:58.520 --> 01:35:02.440]  army this is an occupying army on record to convert America to total
[01:35:02.440 --> 01:35:06.840]  Sovietism you know there's you know black helicopters
[01:35:06.840 --> 01:35:14.480]  circling overhead you know which the whole thing was way unnecessary and
[01:35:14.480 --> 01:35:20.720]  over dramatic and it was really it was really weird the way that the reporter
[01:35:20.720 --> 01:35:25.400]  was standing right in front of the cop car he had his lights on they had all
[01:35:25.400 --> 01:35:30.320]  these lights flashing to make a big scene out of it and try to vote everyone
[01:35:30.320 --> 01:35:35.000]  this is an active crime scene you know oh yeah oh no no that's why they'll do a
[01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:38.920]  year and a half undercover and spend a million plus bucks on an Amish guy they
[01:35:38.920 --> 01:35:43.340]  beg to sell him some milk and cheese and move in his fake neighbors and then
[01:35:43.340 --> 01:35:46.920]  they'll swat team and shove the Amish man to the ground because it's all part of
[01:35:46.920 --> 01:35:51.480]  their mental illness their play acting they're the good guys that this is how
[01:35:51.480 --> 01:35:58.640]  authoritarianism works yeah so I mean I don't know if this time someone hands to
[01:35:58.640 --> 01:36:03.360]  the point where they both turn purple it's considered cruel and unusual but
[01:36:03.360 --> 01:36:08.040]  that definitely happened the woman I told you earlier so they did have the
[01:36:08.040 --> 01:36:10.720]  lawyer they made the other woman sit there and bleed on the floor they
[01:36:10.720 --> 01:36:15.840]  kicked him in the stomach with pleasure they put the zip ties on to tight
[01:36:15.840 --> 01:36:20.880]  will probably get probably get peace prizes for that oh yeah you know maybe
[01:36:20.880 --> 01:36:24.520]  they could drum bomb a couple babies you know murder one and a half million
[01:36:24.520 --> 01:36:31.760]  Iraqi you know actual real crime instead of people non-compliance well you know
[01:36:31.760 --> 01:36:38.080]  when you have a tyranny being good is a crime yeah that's that's the issue and
[01:36:38.080 --> 01:36:41.680]  right now I think we're in the middle of a paradigm shift where people are
[01:36:41.680 --> 01:36:45.640]  reevaluating their relationships with government people are starting to actually
[01:36:45.640 --> 01:36:49.840]  look at government for what it is which you know is Adam actually said on your
[01:36:49.840 --> 01:36:54.640]  show yesterday the group of individuals put this through those society granted
[01:36:54.640 --> 01:36:58.200]  monopoly on the initiation of force without that initiation of force
[01:36:58.200 --> 01:37:02.880]  government is nothing look if you're right they have set up a new class
[01:37:02.880 --> 01:37:07.600]  structure and they know it I was on the grass by Barton Springs after one for a
[01:37:07.600 --> 01:37:12.880]  jog this weekend it was actually 4th of July and I was sitting there felt like
[01:37:12.880 --> 01:37:19.400]  the weekend listening to two cops their wives that work for the government and
[01:37:19.400 --> 01:37:23.320]  their girlfriend whose husband is going to work for the NSA and they were
[01:37:23.320 --> 01:37:28.920]  bragging and on power trips just getting off this is their time this is
[01:37:28.920 --> 01:37:35.040]  their takeover they were groveling in it one guy had headphones in was sitting
[01:37:35.040 --> 01:37:41.280]  there like bouncing his head around like he was really having a good time he was
[01:37:41.280 --> 01:37:45.520]  really sort of you know the weird part is the same guy is a guy with headphones
[01:37:45.520 --> 01:37:49.680]  with a plastic atom but before he was sitting there staring me down when I
[01:37:49.680 --> 01:37:54.440]  was in his room in cuffs but he wanted to do something so I walked up to him you
[01:37:54.440 --> 01:37:58.360]  know and I said hey you want to do something in me you know because he
[01:37:58.360 --> 01:38:05.000]  said I'm just not a fan of people trying to bully me oh I know imagine the
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:10.240]  cowardliness of being a guy body armor the gun is trying to stare down people
[01:38:10.240 --> 01:38:14.640]  and kick them in the stomach hoping they do something it's like look imagine how
[01:38:14.640 --> 01:38:18.960]  disgraceful his family is in the line of scum he comes from or if they weren't
[01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:24.440]  scum imagine what his ancestors would think of him now oh it's disgusting and
[01:38:24.440 --> 01:38:29.400]  I actually mentioned that because I mean we had five hours with nothing to do but
[01:38:29.400 --> 01:38:35.160]  there and talk to everyone except for Adam who is in that room and talk to these
[01:38:35.160 --> 01:38:39.320]  police officers that were guarding us and I thought I was like you know what
[01:38:39.320 --> 01:38:42.840]  would Rosa Parks think about what you're doing you know what would Martin Luther
[01:38:42.840 --> 01:38:46.120]  King think about what you're doing what would Malcolm X think about what you're
[01:38:46.120 --> 01:38:50.880]  doing and of course no response there or something like that but you know then
[01:38:50.880 --> 01:38:56.400]  again these people have been given the government version of you know Martin
[01:38:56.400 --> 01:39:01.120]  Luther King and Malcolm X oh don't worry the government grants right and the
[01:39:01.120 --> 01:39:07.560]  government can grant rights to the black people no the government can only take
[01:39:07.560 --> 01:39:14.320]  away right the government can only oh I know the police now think they now
[01:39:14.320 --> 01:39:17.440]  think owning guns is a privilege they think traveling's a privilege they just
[01:39:17.440 --> 01:39:21.200]  have no idea just like the general public what a free country is now some
[01:39:21.200 --> 01:39:25.040]  police I talked to are waking up I've got my reporter David Knight here he wants
[01:39:25.040 --> 01:39:29.360]  to ask you some questions Lucas okay hey Lucas did did they show you a search
[01:39:29.360 --> 01:39:33.520]  warrant or did they have anything about a search they gave us an incomplete
[01:39:33.520 --> 01:39:38.560]  search warrant after everything happened and there was no probable cost
[01:39:38.560 --> 01:39:42.760]  statement hmm yeah because they're spending five hours they're spending five
[01:39:42.760 --> 01:39:45.520]  hours looking for something I mean it reminds me of the old saying from
[01:39:45.520 --> 01:39:49.640]  Stalinist Russia bring me the man I'll find the crime you know if you spend
[01:39:49.640 --> 01:39:52.920]  five hours in somebody's house you can probably find with all the laws we've
[01:39:52.920 --> 01:39:57.800]  got you probably find something that they've violated yeah well it doesn't
[01:39:57.800 --> 01:40:01.440]  matter every one of those cops will die 30 years young from all the vaccines
[01:40:01.440 --> 01:40:04.560]  they've taken I mean they want it they got it they're dead already their god
[01:40:04.560 --> 01:40:09.680]  already killed them yeah they'll Satan yeah well it also seems like you got
[01:40:09.680 --> 01:40:13.160]  this jurisdictional issue where they're they're coming after me the way the
[01:40:13.160 --> 01:40:16.960]  Washington Post reported it gun activists arrested for you know this DC act
[01:40:16.960 --> 01:40:20.520]  but then in the body of the article they talked just about the mushrooms that
[01:40:20.520 --> 01:40:23.880]  they found it's all they talk about I mean the reason they came there right is
[01:40:23.880 --> 01:40:28.440]  because he loaded that gun in in Washington and it's not he's not the
[01:40:28.440 --> 01:40:32.840]  one the warrant said nothing about drugs right right he's not the one that's
[01:40:32.840 --> 01:40:36.400]  violating the law here it's it's Kathy Lanier in the district of Columbia that's
[01:40:36.400 --> 01:40:40.480]  violating the law the Constitution as well as ignoring the Supreme Court
[01:40:40.480 --> 01:40:45.760]  decision and of course there's a lot of precedent in that where if they come for
[01:40:45.760 --> 01:40:49.320]  one reason but use it as a fishing expedition it's not admissible but
[01:40:49.320 --> 01:40:54.720]  expanding on this whole issue look at all Bloomberg's trying to shut gun sales
[01:40:54.720 --> 01:40:59.520]  down all over the country they use these globalist crime bases Chicago DC New
[01:40:59.520 --> 01:41:06.520]  York to try to rob all of us mm-hmm of our rights yeah yeah and I don't know if
[01:41:06.520 --> 01:41:10.520]  you heard about this it actually might be today there's a there's a pro stop in
[01:41:10.520 --> 01:41:15.640]  Frisk rally in New York City like this this is the state of current affairs like
[01:41:15.640 --> 01:41:23.080]  people are saying yes we are so pro we are going to rally the court of the
[01:41:23.080 --> 01:41:28.120]  government oh no no no no Turdburg ownership Bloomberg passed a law got
[01:41:28.120 --> 01:41:31.720]  got his corrupt government to pass the laws they're all a bunch of mafia to say
[01:41:31.720 --> 01:41:36.160]  there's no Fourth Amendment but I mean look at Texas they pull you your wife
[01:41:36.160 --> 01:41:40.640]  over here and I mean we just absolutely rape them with their hand
[01:41:40.640 --> 01:41:43.720]  Bloomberg also went into different jurisdictions in other states and
[01:41:43.720 --> 01:41:47.280]  entrap people and then said that they would you know for illegal gun
[01:41:47.280 --> 01:41:50.680]  violations you know technicalities on gun sales and then said they'd let them
[01:41:50.680 --> 01:41:55.480]  off if they'd accept a special master from him well scum burger filth burger
[01:41:55.480 --> 01:42:00.000]  fraud burger un-American burger we're calling I mean yeah no he's involved in
[01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:08.200]  all sorts of crimes yeah pervberg yeah well it reminds me also of Waco you
[01:42:08.200 --> 01:42:11.000]  know you're talking about the media also knew about all this and they were all
[01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:14.440]  set up to take pictures of this is exactly what they did with Waco you know
[01:42:14.440 --> 01:42:17.320]  they they had all the media there as they had the initial rate that's what we
[01:42:17.320 --> 01:42:21.000]  got pictures of it and they even had the code word showtime you know when they
[01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:26.080]  now even use SWAT teams from Texas to California at roadside checkpoints where
[01:42:26.080 --> 01:42:30.120]  they'll ask for blood but the people are so scared they do it be like robbers
[01:42:30.120 --> 01:42:34.880]  going give me your watch I'm your friend you don't mind do you I mean it's color
[01:42:34.880 --> 01:42:40.120]  a law robbery right oh yeah absolutely anything else you want to add about
[01:42:40.120 --> 01:42:45.040]  because again the number of helicopters armored vehicles and so it was
[01:42:45.040 --> 01:42:51.680]  particularly described the Park Service SWAT team yeah it was by far the most
[01:42:51.680 --> 01:42:57.960]  it's the most scary experience of my life you know they do the flashbang grenade
[01:42:57.960 --> 01:43:03.040]  in the house on entry we're running through the entire house with a drug
[01:43:03.040 --> 01:43:08.760]  dog whenever the warrant said nothing about drugs and the entire time you know
[01:43:08.760 --> 01:43:15.560]  even even while handcuff we were we were being muzzle flashed and everything
[01:43:15.560 --> 01:43:25.240]  like that so it's really really a bad situation the federal family though
[01:43:25.240 --> 01:43:29.440]  remember last year Janet's internal document you're all part of the federal
[01:43:29.440 --> 01:43:37.120]  family now we call it La Cosa Fedstra yeah but also Rob do had an interesting
[01:43:37.120 --> 01:43:39.560]  point he said look at the difference in the way they treated this football
[01:43:39.560 --> 01:43:42.800]  player that they just arrested Hernandez right here's a guy that they've got
[01:43:42.800 --> 01:43:45.920]  surveillance tape of him basically committing a murder and they handle him
[01:43:45.920 --> 01:43:49.720]  with kid gloves or basically what you would expect well they admire that they
[01:43:49.720 --> 01:43:53.680]  admire the tats and death they like it they want to grease our families yeah
[01:43:53.680 --> 01:43:58.480]  it's a lot of they sure took care of these things didn't they yeah it's funny
[01:43:58.480 --> 01:44:04.720]  yeah it's funny that Aaron Hernandez was taken by many to very calm and cool
[01:44:04.720 --> 01:44:10.840]  after he committed a murder and and then someone and then yeah and he's
[01:44:10.840 --> 01:44:15.200]  suspected of another murder well I mean let's be honest those are just really
[01:44:15.200 --> 01:44:18.800]  real police police detectives who want to be able to get him I mean to be honest
[01:44:18.800 --> 01:44:21.680]  so they were doing it all about the book you were dealing with the federal
[01:44:21.680 --> 01:44:27.800]  family so the family yes the federal family so maybe a better analogy is that
[01:44:27.800 --> 01:44:33.120]  as the David Gregory thing where he holds up an illegal gun you know an NBC news
[01:44:33.120 --> 01:44:37.680]  well that exactly I think that's how Adam beats this in court is going well
[01:44:37.680 --> 01:44:42.760]  why is he allowed to have a gun oh but he's part of the federal family yeah
[01:44:42.760 --> 01:44:49.080]  well you're not a part of the dinosaur corporate media and you know you're not
[01:44:49.080 --> 01:44:54.440]  allowed to bring guns on TV you're not allowed to make videos of you having
[01:44:54.440 --> 01:44:59.840]  illegal supposedly legal things in DC you know if you're not not part of the
[01:44:59.840 --> 01:45:04.640]  dinosaur lamestream media and now I do these things oh well I mean here's the
[01:45:04.640 --> 01:45:09.200]  thing the dinosaur media is only good now they kind of put out an official
[01:45:09.200 --> 01:45:13.000]  story and hope we pick it up but all we do now is dissected I mean they
[01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:17.120]  literally are hemorrhaging to death so in a way I see this more as their death
[01:45:17.120 --> 01:45:22.680]  throws that are going on so Adam has he been arraigned yet were you in the
[01:45:22.680 --> 01:45:30.520]  courtroom any other tidbits Adam was it's kind of wishy-washy but we believe
[01:45:30.520 --> 01:45:36.240]  he was arraigned today reports are that he refused to leave a cell hole and
[01:45:36.240 --> 01:45:42.360]  everything like that so I'm not I can't confirm that report I just heard these
[01:45:42.360 --> 01:45:46.560]  from multiple people now that you refused to leave it so I doesn't really
[01:45:46.560 --> 01:45:53.640]  seem like wouldn't surprise me if Adam did refuse to leave this cell he's a big
[01:45:53.640 --> 01:46:00.000]  fan of peaceful non-compliance so yeah and he did that on the last fake charges
[01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:03.600]  and they had to drop them because usually people just comply the cops go you
[01:46:03.600 --> 01:46:07.880]  know you did this well I did and then they get you to plea bargain and then
[01:46:07.880 --> 01:46:12.080]  you have no rights they can't stand it when you actually create a court case
[01:46:12.080 --> 01:46:17.720]  out of it yeah he needs a jury trial to if they press charges well they'll bring
[01:46:17.720 --> 01:46:21.400]  in all the all the wives of the SWAT team but they can all sit there and like
[01:46:21.400 --> 01:46:24.920]  smack their lips on power trips there but they're all gonna get it did you
[01:46:24.920 --> 01:46:27.160]  know I was reading almost all the federal pension funds have already been
[01:46:27.160 --> 01:46:30.120]  taken they're not gonna get them these idiots have no idea what they're part of
[01:46:30.120 --> 01:46:33.160]  yeah they're bringing this chair in the end I heard today they're not gonna pay
[01:46:33.160 --> 01:46:36.200]  the troops now you're saying well we may not pay troops anymore it's like yeah
[01:46:36.200 --> 01:46:44.760]  it's like oh who cares all right swap James will kill you if you don't like it you know yeah no they were sending that when I was done so that was that
[01:46:44.760 --> 01:46:49.520]  was scary experience when you're obligated by law to serve and they threaten not to
[01:46:49.520 --> 01:46:56.360]  pay you but you know it's just been a pleasure as always and I wish you a
[01:46:56.360 --> 01:47:02.360]  very wonderful day and God bless all right well thank you so much and we'll
[01:47:02.360 --> 01:47:08.240]  get updates from you in the future Lucas thank you all right there goes
[01:47:08.240 --> 01:47:13.440]  Lucas jewel give us a update on I mean I mean this is obviously a very serious
[01:47:13.440 --> 01:47:17.280]  case and he has a lot of courage and he will draw attention to the fact that's
[01:47:17.280 --> 01:47:20.600]  an unconstitutional law they knew that too that's why they did the drug stuff
[01:47:20.600 --> 01:47:24.800]  I mean who knows if that those mushrooms were even his that's right if
[01:47:24.800 --> 01:47:28.160]  they're there for five hours they can plant evidence you know I mean that's
[01:47:28.160 --> 01:47:31.400]  just it's just the atoms the type who would have those probably and then just
[01:47:31.400 --> 01:47:35.120]  do it in their face not caring because well I mean they they know that he is
[01:47:35.120 --> 01:47:39.320]  against the unconstitutional war on drugs so they know that it's believable
[01:47:39.320 --> 01:47:41.920]  that they could put anything that they want to in there and people would believe
[01:47:41.920 --> 01:47:45.080]  it so it could be either way it could be either way but I mean my whole deal is
[01:47:45.080 --> 01:47:52.120]  victimless crime of mushrooms mm-hmm I tell you this this is insane briefly we
[01:47:52.120 --> 01:47:56.960]  got totally overwhelmed over 600 good entries yes to Operation Paul Revere of
[01:47:56.960 --> 01:48:01.720]  $120,000 in prizes or is it 100,000 first place 15,000 second place
[01:48:01.720 --> 01:48:05.880]  5,000 third place 10,000 second 5,000 third okay good I'm getting my own
[01:48:05.880 --> 01:48:11.960]  contest wrong here okay and so that's very very exciting and we really good
[01:48:11.960 --> 01:48:15.200]  entries that's what's making it really hard you know we're trying to get
[01:48:15.200 --> 01:48:19.360]  something posted up so people can see each other's work but there's just
[01:48:19.360 --> 01:48:22.960]  there's a lot of good entries to choose from this turn out strong better than we
[01:48:22.960 --> 01:48:27.160]  thought we're victims of our own success great job to everybody we've we've had
[01:48:27.160 --> 01:48:32.160]  multiple people including myself watch the 600 videos I probably watched 200
[01:48:32.160 --> 01:48:37.680]  myself we're down to about 50 or 60 that are incredible some of these are just so
[01:48:37.680 --> 01:48:43.320]  good I can't believe it and so it'll be by the end of July we should be able to
[01:48:43.320 --> 01:48:46.600]  announce first place yeah oh yeah we just get more and more behind because it's
[01:48:46.600 --> 01:48:50.240]  just it's so amazing and we want to be able to trot out the top 50 and the top
[01:48:50.240 --> 01:48:54.720]  30 the top 20 the top 10 we want to be able to give them all attention to so
[01:48:54.720 --> 01:48:59.880]  just great job everybody when should we be ready to announce the site where
[01:48:59.880 --> 01:49:04.720]  people can see all 600 or so well we're hoping that it'll be ready by the
[01:49:04.720 --> 01:49:09.000]  beginning of next week so yeah and that's a Herculean effort just to try to
[01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:13.120]  put them in categories that's right I mean again 600 videos folks and when I
[01:49:13.120 --> 01:49:16.720]  say 600 I think it's more than that and then I mean it's yeah I was a little bit
[01:49:16.720 --> 01:49:22.120]  over 600 we're not we're gonna select a subset of that and so we'll probably have
[01:49:22.120 --> 01:49:27.040]  up about half of them as selections but we'll have all of them listed at Planet
[01:49:27.040 --> 01:49:31.000]  Info Wars so people can can take a look at everything there but we wanted to kind
[01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:35.120]  of pull out kind of the the best half of them and put it there and then start
[01:49:35.120 --> 01:49:38.560]  pulling it down from from that yeah again that way attention gets given to
[01:49:38.560 --> 01:49:42.000]  all the filmmakers it's about resisting tyranny that's the real win that's right
[01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:46.880]  and but it's a big prize to you know bring in some heavy hitters and then we're
[01:49:46.880 --> 01:49:49.920]  gonna probably talk to the top 20 people and say what are your ideas what would
[01:49:49.920 --> 01:49:54.960]  you like to do we're overwhelmed economically staff wise there's all
[01:49:54.960 --> 01:49:58.760]  these films I want to make and I've got to not see my children and work seven
[01:49:58.760 --> 01:50:02.640]  days a week to do it I'm about to go into an intense work phase again and I'm
[01:50:02.640 --> 01:50:06.120]  just praying God give me the strength to do it to finish Obama deception to do a
[01:50:06.120 --> 01:50:09.320]  bunch of other stuff we got planned the studio is almost done I mean we're in

[01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:11.840]  all right here's what I'm gonna do I want to show you some of the FBI training
[01:54:11.840 --> 01:54:16.480]  manuals but also the flyers they put out the hundreds of different types of
[01:54:16.480 --> 01:54:21.040]  businesses there's hundreds of these a year where it says I'm woman with a baby
[01:54:21.040 --> 01:54:24.280]  stroller a man with blue jeans talking on the cell phone taking photos of
[01:54:24.280 --> 01:54:27.680]  anything paying for cash or anything you know mark down who they are call the
[01:54:27.680 --> 01:54:34.800]  FBI and this is done on purpose to just flood fake chatter and to make people
[01:54:34.800 --> 01:54:39.040]  think it's okay to spy on everyone to normalize spying in the federal
[01:54:39.040 --> 01:54:43.840]  government on their own systems to get rid of the Fourth Amendment but to also
[01:54:43.840 --> 01:54:49.400]  flood the NSA databases with so many fake reports the globalists can get away
[01:54:49.400 --> 01:54:52.120]  with all the other stuff they're doing because they're getting caught all the
[01:54:52.120 --> 01:54:56.240]  time shipping narcotics in and shipping little kids out and just every crime you
[01:54:56.240 --> 01:54:59.720]  can imagine then they've got to shut down the investigation then it's
[01:54:59.720 --> 01:55:04.720]  embarrassing Texas Youth Commission gets caught running big pedophile rings in
[01:55:04.720 --> 01:55:08.800]  Texas they got to shut that down it's embarrassing they get away with it of
[01:55:08.800 --> 01:55:12.480]  course but it's still embarrassing you know two trillion missing at the Pentagon
[01:55:12.480 --> 01:55:17.760]  it's embarrassing so now that's just all gonna end they're gonna spy on
[01:55:17.760 --> 01:55:21.360]  everybody and if you report what they're doing to somebody's kid you're
[01:55:21.360 --> 01:55:25.440]  gonna go to federal prison if you report torturing people you're gonna go to
[01:55:25.440 --> 01:55:33.000]  federal prison you're gonna let the criminals take over period and that's
[01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:37.760]  what's happening in America so I want to take your calls on this and go over it
[01:55:37.760 --> 01:55:42.080]  and like it's like watching children the public debate well is it suspicious if
[01:55:42.080 --> 01:55:48.120]  someone takes the vacation or volunteers for work and again everyone's a suspect
[01:55:48.120 --> 01:55:52.880]  now be paranoid of spies and terrorists everywhere when we have a corporate
[01:55:52.880 --> 01:55:58.160]  spy group that is moving everything we've got to China
[01:55:59.960 --> 01:56:03.680]  openly bragging they've established a corporate world government with
[01:56:03.680 --> 01:56:09.640]  diplomatic immunity there's the enemy and they've got you going yeah well the
[01:56:09.640 --> 01:56:14.680]  Ruskies may get it the Ruskies are scared to death they've never faced any
[01:56:14.680 --> 01:56:20.600]  evil like this and of course they're corrupt and pathetic that's why that's
[01:56:20.600 --> 01:56:23.280]  why they can't beat the New World Order about pathetic the Russians are tough
[01:56:23.280 --> 01:56:27.640]  they're smart they're just not this organized and scientifically evil they
[01:56:27.640 --> 01:56:31.760]  are just not as evil as the New World Order they're very upset they're very
[01:56:31.760 --> 01:56:36.840]  greedy about it Stalin admired Hitler you can and couldn't get his forces to
[01:56:36.840 --> 01:56:40.320]  be as professional even though when it got down to a fight his forces beat
[01:56:40.320 --> 01:56:46.800]  Hitler with Western weapons the Russians that fight just as hard as a Nazi or
[01:56:46.800 --> 01:56:50.200]  anybody else for that matter or harder the thing is they just they just they're
[01:56:50.200 --> 01:56:54.400]  more thuggish their government mafia is more just old-fashioned thug they want
[01:56:54.400 --> 01:56:58.320]  to just run stuff they don't want to poison everybody's water and you know

[01:57:11.760 --> 01:57:16.200]  50 videos literally of the Democrats in circles for hours chanting Hail Satan

[01:57:30.880 --> 01:57:37.000]  all the other groups don't don't burn them up and it's the same deal humans

[02:00:20.360 --> 02:00:27.840]  Alex Jones there is one word that describes the form of government that
[02:00:27.840 --> 02:00:32.520]  our nation is quickly devolving to and it's called predatory the toll train
[02:00:32.520 --> 02:00:38.440]  number to join us is 800 259 92 31 we have a lot of breaking news I'm gonna
[02:00:38.440 --> 02:00:42.720]  get to you briefly start of the next segment and start going to your phone
[02:00:42.720 --> 02:00:49.920]  calls the toll-free number to join us is 800 800 259 92 31 and right now let's
[02:00:49.920 --> 02:00:54.720]  go to Michael in New York he wants to talk about Russian troops to oversee
[02:00:54.720 --> 02:01:00.760]  mass events in the US and disaster drills Michael you're on the air go
[02:01:00.760 --> 02:01:09.160]  ahead hey how's it going good sir I'm with the United States Army and you
[02:01:09.160 --> 02:01:16.400]  know I've been reading up on this whole Russian troop nonsense and it kind of
[02:01:16.400 --> 02:01:20.040]  upsets me because there's a lot of us that sit around it don't do anything
[02:01:20.040 --> 02:01:26.360]  and you can ask anybody here they don't ever want to have to kill our own
[02:01:26.360 --> 02:01:30.880]  people and I've been following killing our own people is loving and liberal I
[02:01:30.880 --> 02:01:36.840]  guess boarding babies is liberal what's wrong with that everything's wrong with
[02:01:36.840 --> 02:01:42.480]  that I mean it's the government is trying to do all these sorts of things
[02:01:42.480 --> 02:01:46.080]  that don't make sense like right now they got operation Don Blitz going on
[02:01:46.080 --> 02:01:51.160]  down in Camp Pendleton where there's seven thousand troops from different
[02:01:51.160 --> 02:01:55.000]  countries training with the US Marine Corps right now that's right and it
[02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:58.120]  doesn't make sense to me while we're reaching out to all these other
[02:01:58.120 --> 02:02:03.040]  countries when you know we're not really in a state right now because right now
[02:02:03.040 --> 02:02:09.120]  people need to step up and you know protect their families because apparently
[02:02:09.120 --> 02:02:13.560]  there's a disaster drill going down in section three which is the Washington DC
[02:02:13.560 --> 02:02:20.320]  Maryland Baltimore area and it's some pretty scary and heavy stuff I mean
[02:02:20.320 --> 02:02:27.400]  because we've been doing drills here with NBC and everything lately and yeah
[02:02:27.400 --> 02:02:30.760]  well they do that as trauma-based mind control let me explain from my own
[02:02:30.760 --> 02:02:37.480]  research and you have your own insight insight they do the chem drills the NBC
[02:02:37.480 --> 02:02:42.280]  drills nuclear chemical biological to make it sound legitimate why the Army
[02:02:42.280 --> 02:02:46.600]  and Marines are there they do the constant foreign troop drills to get
[02:02:46.600 --> 02:02:50.800]  everybody used to foreign troops being around then they segue into by the way
[02:02:50.800 --> 02:02:55.240]  we're going to use these domestically during a civil war or civil unrest we
[02:02:55.240 --> 02:03:01.080]  always said that now that's official so again it's all dog training they I mean
[02:03:01.080 --> 02:03:04.880]  look at TV it's just there's always checkpoints there's always SWAT teams it's
[02:03:04.880 --> 02:03:10.360]  it's you know oh it's always martial law but it's always for your own good and so
[02:03:10.360 --> 02:03:16.080]  and and the point is it's building towards a crescendo what are you being
[02:03:16.080 --> 02:03:23.480]  told well I'm infantry and we've been we've been taught how to clear
[02:03:23.480 --> 02:03:31.520]  rooms a certain way and they they they they actually just taught us a new way
[02:03:31.520 --> 02:03:37.280]  how to clear rooms and shit I'm gonna have to lay out on that but I mean
[02:03:37.280 --> 02:03:42.720]  specifically how do you clear the room and it the way you guys would do it over
[02:03:42.720 --> 02:03:46.760]  and all right to shoot everybody up front basically it's the kick down the
[02:03:46.760 --> 02:03:52.920]  door and go in and just kill everything there's no there's no there's no niceness
[02:03:52.920 --> 02:03:57.360]  anymore it's all aggressive and with momentum it's yeah so that's why well
[02:03:57.360 --> 02:03:59.320]  yeah no no that's that's been going for a while
[02:03:59.320 --> 02:04:04.960]  exactly no it's a death squad and so that's what they're doing I mean they
[02:04:04.960 --> 02:04:09.360]  blew up Hastings car and basically want it known they did it and and they've got
[02:04:09.360 --> 02:04:12.720]  death squads the guys think it's real tough to do that and in the future they
[02:04:12.720 --> 02:04:16.280]  will come to your house and and not even claim you fought back they'll just kill
[02:04:16.280 --> 02:04:21.200]  everybody and so I suggest people line up out front with their kids Neil and
[02:04:21.200 --> 02:04:27.040]  say USA USA USA when they get shot in the head I mean like you know they had
[02:04:27.040 --> 02:04:30.720]  private gruckheimer 10 years ago say oh in Afghanistan we go in and kill even
[02:04:30.720 --> 02:04:35.000]  babies in these villages and the media said that was a good thing so I mean
[02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:39.920]  don't you want to chant USA USA I think it's patriotic to take your child to
[02:04:39.920 --> 02:04:43.680]  them and then help put the rifle to their head and then say I worship Obama
[02:04:43.680 --> 02:04:49.160]  and have them pull the trigger so you're saying yeah that's the that's the training
[02:04:49.160 --> 02:04:52.120]  you're getting for domestic operations in America is to go in and kill
[02:04:52.120 --> 02:04:56.920]  everybody apparently that's what they're saying but like I want to hear more
[02:04:56.920 --> 02:05:00.600]  about this I think this is a great idea stay with us

[02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:54.440]  Eastern 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central and I got to be honest with you even watching
[02:08:54.440 --> 02:08:59.200]  the libertarian Patriot sites not know the nature of the spying and the grid
[02:08:59.200 --> 02:09:03.640]  and what's happening because they haven't studied Rome spy grids they haven't
[02:09:03.640 --> 02:09:07.920]  studied the British spy grids they haven't studied the French spy grids they
[02:09:07.920 --> 02:09:13.040]  haven't studied the Nazi or Soviet spy grids it's just watching everyone fall
[02:09:13.040 --> 02:09:17.360]  headlong into this is so frustrating ladies and gentlemen they don't just
[02:09:17.360 --> 02:09:22.760]  have the Obama program of the enemy within when the enemy is obviously the
[02:09:22.760 --> 02:09:28.600]  globalist they for over 15 years but it's intensified have these training
[02:09:28.600 --> 02:09:32.360]  manuals I'm gonna get to after I take some calls that are put out publicly
[02:09:32.360 --> 02:09:39.240]  where it says buying coffee with cash call the FBI wearing blue jeans call the
[02:09:39.240 --> 02:09:45.440]  FBI I'm not joking breastfeeding call the FBI getting an American flag tattoo
[02:09:45.440 --> 02:09:49.960]  call the FBI someone is in your hardware store with a burn on their hand
[02:09:49.960 --> 02:09:55.080]  call the FBI and it's meant to make everyone a suspect but the occupational
[02:09:55.080 --> 02:10:00.120]  government we have that has hijacked and taken control of our nation there's
[02:10:00.120 --> 02:10:04.080]  the Ethan Huff article for info wars dot com FBI says paying for your coffee
[02:10:04.080 --> 02:10:08.080]  with cash a potential terrorist activity we ought to just repost all our old
[02:10:08.080 --> 02:10:14.800]  articles and it'll be big breaking news this has been going on as they brand the
[02:10:14.800 --> 02:10:20.160]  public as the terrorist the police admit they're told Al Qaeda is not even on
[02:10:20.160 --> 02:10:25.320]  the radar now it's tea partiers that are gonna blow stuff up any moment now of
[02:10:25.320 --> 02:10:27.880]  course the globalist are gonna blow stuff up and blame it on us because we're
[02:10:27.880 --> 02:10:31.840]  the opposition we're the people that know about the takeover that's why
[02:10:31.840 --> 02:10:36.920]  they're coming after us but I mean look at this McClatchy Bureau I mean I saw
[02:10:36.920 --> 02:10:42.240]  this a couple days ago I don't know why this is so big now I saw where it said
[02:10:42.240 --> 02:10:46.200]  Obama instructing employees for all federal employees to watch each other
[02:10:46.200 --> 02:10:50.120]  and they're like well we've always done this yeah the employee is raping someone
[02:10:50.120 --> 02:10:55.400]  the broom closet or stealing computers out the back door you don't need to be
[02:10:55.400 --> 02:11:02.400]  told to say something about that you know what is an insider threat no the
[02:11:02.400 --> 02:11:07.320]  insider threat is people that report on criminal activity torture illegal spying
[02:11:07.320 --> 02:11:15.480]  thieving that's who they've been putting in jail we all saw or at least most of
[02:11:15.480 --> 02:11:18.320]  you probably heard we played on the radio a few months ago the ATF video
[02:11:18.320 --> 02:11:22.680]  where the director of ATF the interim director is like really threatening in
[02:11:22.680 --> 02:11:26.840]  the videos you have a responsibility and you will not talk to the media or
[02:11:26.840 --> 02:11:29.680]  anybody else about what's going on you will talk to your advice you will talk
[02:11:29.680 --> 02:11:35.200]  to your superior and that's it and blah blah blah because they're all in there
[02:11:35.200 --> 02:11:40.560]  doing whatever they want the government is so corrupt folks they're stealing so
[02:11:40.560 --> 02:11:45.440]  much money out of the Pentagon right now the private contractors the 840
[02:11:45.440 --> 02:11:49.280]  something thousand private contractors that have above top secret clearances to
[02:11:49.280 --> 02:11:53.000]  be able to get into everybody's data they're using on their ex-wives ex-husbands
[02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:58.640]  neighbors competition cops are using it the other databases that aren't as big
[02:11:58.640 --> 02:12:03.760]  as that but are close on everybody I mean it is just totally insane and yes
[02:12:03.760 --> 02:12:11.640]  police I know you have databases that are Lexis Nexus Thompson Reuters I am
[02:12:11.640 --> 02:12:18.720]  fully and completely absolutely aware of all that you all think your secret
[02:12:18.720 --> 02:12:23.200]  police and oh you're part of special event security you're part of you know
[02:12:23.200 --> 02:12:27.720]  infraguard or you're part of clergy response and everyone's a secret agent
[02:12:27.720 --> 02:12:32.040]  now and all the shows on TV and these people think they've arrived they they
[02:12:32.040 --> 02:12:36.840]  think they're part of a club the oldest scam in the world is to say you know join
[02:12:36.840 --> 02:12:43.480]  our club and you know you get the certificate that you're part of it instead
[02:12:43.480 --> 02:12:47.280]  of really going out and training people to be something that you say oh you're
[02:12:47.280 --> 02:12:51.000]  part of the club now people think they've arrived in the club you've arrived
[02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:58.680]  in the club of un-American drooling sycophantic bootlicking tyranny
[02:12:58.680 --> 02:13:07.640]  enabling Dudley do right pieces of garbage that's that's the club that's
[02:13:07.640 --> 02:13:14.560]  the club that you've entered that's the club that you're part of that's the
[02:13:14.560 --> 02:13:20.760]  club and let me explain everybody you know out there alternative media some
[02:13:20.760 --> 02:13:24.800]  basic things we always report on what the mainstream reports instead of going
[02:13:24.800 --> 02:13:29.560]  look McClatchy is reporting on this and they do some good reporting by the way
[02:13:29.560 --> 02:13:34.520]  that's actually a truly journalistic outfit in my respects I'm amazed over
[02:13:34.520 --> 02:13:37.920]  and over again hey here's all this other places where this has already been
[02:13:37.920 --> 02:13:42.800]  going on much worse and then you use a big story that's finally got the
[02:13:42.800 --> 02:13:49.120]  people attention to show them everything else that's happened and McClatchy goes
[02:13:49.120 --> 02:13:56.080]  on with their analysis to say the pre-crime plan experts Obama's plan to
[02:13:56.080 --> 02:14:00.600]  predict future leakers unproven unlikely to work it's meant to create a
[02:14:00.600 --> 02:14:07.880]  culture of spies so that they can frame whoever they want they're gonna be
[02:14:07.880 --> 02:14:12.680]  arresting a lot of innocent people who haven't even reported on stuff the
[02:14:12.680 --> 02:14:15.680]  government's doing just to scare everyone this is called a reign of terror
[02:14:15.680 --> 02:14:23.320]  and a reign of terror always begins within the government in the Soviet Union
[02:14:23.320 --> 02:14:28.720]  they had purge after purge at our linen and Mao and then the whole other list of
[02:14:28.720 --> 02:14:32.920]  cruise chef and all the other little little demons and then Mao and then the
[02:14:32.920 --> 02:14:38.600]  purges after that and then of course the purges in Nazi Germany night of the
[02:14:38.600 --> 02:14:43.720]  long knives against the essay and Ernst Roman just purge after purge after purge
[02:14:43.720 --> 02:14:50.720]  this is the fruits of tyranny this is the fruits of of clicks and gangs and the
[02:14:50.720 --> 02:14:55.320]  worship of domestic uniforms and the worship of the black mask and the
[02:14:55.320 --> 02:15:01.160]  worship of the black helicopter and the the worship of the gangsterism and men
[02:15:01.160 --> 02:15:05.280]  who don't succumb to the metrosexualism they're sold to be trendy in the media
[02:15:05.280 --> 02:15:09.760]  then kind of then succumb to gangsterism where they then try to act
[02:15:09.760 --> 02:15:14.600]  gangsterist and strut around puffing themselves up as if that's what a man is
[02:15:14.600 --> 02:15:18.640]  supposed to act like and it just runs from bad to worse and we know exactly
[02:15:18.640 --> 02:15:28.080]  where this cesspit goes straight to hell and I sit here with horror watching it
[02:15:28.080 --> 02:15:37.360]  unfold it is a scientific despotism a scientific evil it is predatory
[02:15:37.360 --> 02:15:45.240]  government enshrined in a systematic corporately planned operation of six
[02:15:45.240 --> 02:15:50.240]  global megabanks on record destroying the world economy and consolidating it
[02:15:50.240 --> 02:15:54.400]  into their hands manipulating every market up one side and down the other
[02:15:54.400 --> 02:16:00.520]  and creating some more chaos more death more destruction until it folds into
[02:16:00.520 --> 02:16:05.160]  highly compact technocratic governmental and corporate command bases that are
[02:16:05.160 --> 02:16:09.440]  above the law with diplomatic immunity and the rest of us living an absolute
[02:16:09.440 --> 02:16:15.400]  resilient style squalor to then have controlled bio weapons released against
[02:16:15.400 --> 02:16:21.280]  us to reduce our numbers down to zero outside of the command bases and of
[02:16:21.280 --> 02:16:25.920]  course within the phasing end of this over the next 20 years the robots will
[02:16:25.920 --> 02:16:30.680]  be brought in and all the meathead thugs that serve the system of the neural
[02:16:30.680 --> 02:16:38.720]  order hates more than anyone you are all slated for special fates so remember
[02:16:38.720 --> 02:16:44.960]  anyone serving this is the most pathetic sickening chump you can imagine and
[02:16:44.960 --> 02:16:51.800]  deserves our pity now do we still have that last caller I was talking to yeah
[02:16:51.800 --> 02:16:54.200]  he was calling in I don't need to know if the caller was telling the truth or
[02:16:54.200 --> 02:16:59.400]  not because I already know that the way they clear a building in Baghdad or in
[02:16:59.400 --> 02:17:05.800]  Fallujah or in the outskirts of Kabul this is the big military secret and why
[02:17:05.800 --> 02:17:12.040]  so many of them commit suicide or one of the factors is that their order just to
[02:17:12.040 --> 02:17:16.400]  see if they'll do it to go into villages and whole neighborhoods and kill
[02:17:16.400 --> 02:17:23.360]  everyone now if a member of the unit gets really broke up over the fact that
[02:17:23.360 --> 02:17:27.600]  before they kill the little girls they rape them and it gets out in the press
[02:17:27.600 --> 02:17:35.040]  then they'll send the sergeant to prison but only one it leaks and in the
[02:17:35.040 --> 02:17:39.920]  future there'll be no leaking if they have their way so the troops are there
[02:17:39.920 --> 02:17:43.320]  I mean that's you sell these suicide notes they go we raped we killed we
[02:17:43.320 --> 02:17:47.240]  tortured and you're like well it must have been about al-qaeda no al-qaeda are
[02:17:47.240 --> 02:17:52.600]  the darling preciouses they're all you know perfumed and lavished and paid in
[02:17:52.600 --> 02:17:57.240]  gold they're the Saudi Arabian darlings no no no these are innocent families
[02:17:57.240 --> 02:18:02.240]  and the guys that like it are brought back psychologically profiled and
[02:18:02.240 --> 02:18:05.920]  they're going to be pulling you and your family over and to them you're a dirty
[02:18:05.920 --> 02:18:10.000]  ugly animal and they're certainly like having to pull you over and write the
[02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:14.440]  tickets and make the money for the system they disdain you as an enemy that
[02:18:14.440 --> 02:18:17.840]  is the new type and so he was talking about how the new army training for
[02:18:17.840 --> 02:18:22.360]  domestic operations is to go door-to-door kick the door in you know
[02:18:22.360 --> 02:18:26.160]  basically throw a hand grenade in and then go in and kill everybody and that
[02:18:26.160 --> 02:18:31.600]  is the training and these guys get off on this either they go you know freak
[02:18:31.600 --> 02:18:34.160]  out go commit suicide which they shouldn't do they should go blow the
[02:18:34.160 --> 02:18:38.280]  whistle but no they they can't not follow the order there's the obsession
[02:18:38.280 --> 02:18:44.760]  with following the order so instead of going oh this is a crime I'm gonna speak
[02:18:44.760 --> 02:18:49.400]  out against it I'm gonna challenge it no they go and they blow their head off
[02:18:49.400 --> 02:18:53.440]  and then all the sickos in the unit sit there and laugh look at that he was
[02:18:53.440 --> 02:18:58.400]  weak because in an evil world it's the more vicious you are the more hardcore
[02:18:58.400 --> 02:19:02.920]  you are you're admired when Bersensky gets up at the CFR or a club of Rome
[02:19:02.920 --> 02:19:09.240]  meeting it's been reported they just get tears in their eyes and admire him
[02:19:09.240 --> 02:19:13.840]  because this is a man who funded with Paul pot and other operations millions
[02:19:13.840 --> 02:19:18.960]  and millions of dead including children and that scene is a demonic power that
[02:19:18.960 --> 02:19:24.080]  that's a that's a great victory against humanity and that's why they admire

[02:25:44.840 --> 02:25:50.360]  country is going today it's just terrible I I was listening to you earlier
[02:25:50.360 --> 02:25:55.320]  talking about Charlie Rangel and it's very me I had to call him up and
[02:25:55.320 --> 02:26:03.880]  basically tell him basically that you know what they're doing is criminal you
[02:26:03.880 --> 02:26:09.680]  don't buy by the Constitution United States anymore and as for most of those
[02:26:09.680 --> 02:26:13.360]  politicians in Washington DC they should be brought up in criminal charges and
[02:26:13.360 --> 02:26:17.760]  arrested and imprisoned for the rest of their lives and I said the thing is I
[02:26:17.760 --> 02:26:22.160]  was talking to a staff member I said the thing is is between me and you I said we
[02:26:22.160 --> 02:26:27.320]  both know that CIA brings in the drugs I said you know I'm not gonna I'm not
[02:26:27.320 --> 02:26:31.800]  gonna play around here anymore and and you know I've called that's just one of
[02:26:31.800 --> 02:26:36.080]  the representatives many of that I've called you know like I heard you talking
[02:26:36.080 --> 02:26:42.480]  yesterday about the you know Hale Satan you know Nancy Pelosi you know she's
[02:26:42.480 --> 02:26:46.760]  supposedly a professed Catholic why I called her and told her well these are
[02:26:46.760 --> 02:26:51.320]  your people I guess you must be a famous well they are Satanists whether
[02:26:51.320 --> 02:26:54.360]  they're practicing Satanists or not they follow the tenets that Satan won't be
[02:26:54.360 --> 02:26:58.880]  proud of but yeah Rangel's trying to stir up stuff on the Trayvon Martin deal
[02:26:58.880 --> 02:27:04.440]  you've got all these but here's the problem the bureaucracy is now the
[02:27:04.440 --> 02:27:10.680]  economy there they're succeeding in making the economy the corruption to where
[02:27:10.680 --> 02:27:16.040]  it's hard to dig them out because they want to win against good I mean that's
[02:27:16.040 --> 02:27:20.080]  why they're so evil is that it's conscious and I appreciate your call
[02:27:20.080 --> 02:27:26.760]  Kirk great points Mitch in Wisconsin you're on the air yes sir

[02:27:46.440 --> 02:27:53.440]  where you're on air right now yeah I mean you're on air right now yeah I wanted
[02:27:53.440 --> 02:27:56.520]  to ask you about cold cash and then something that you talked about in our
[02:27:56.520 --> 02:28:00.480]  earlier talk show okay but yeah all right let me put you on hold and then we'll
[02:28:00.480 --> 02:28:05.680]  uh once we go on air I'll put you on air how's that sound oh we're not on air
[02:28:05.680 --> 02:28:09.760]  listen brother I don't get the calls everybody calls in and then does like a
[02:28:09.760 --> 02:28:14.440]  call-screen thing with me on air you're on air
[02:28:16.240 --> 02:28:20.680]  today when cold cash got raided I just was thinking are they gonna do
[02:28:20.680 --> 02:28:24.760]  anything after this because it kind of seems like they're not stopping and
[02:28:24.760 --> 02:28:28.880]  everything they do to them it's just like one up top another I don't ever see
[02:28:28.880 --> 02:28:34.120]  any rest for this guy well I mean cold cash some people say oh he must be a
[02:28:34.120 --> 02:28:39.600]  provocateur operative I don't think that's the case I think that he is wound
[02:28:39.600 --> 02:28:44.920]  up wants to be part of history doesn't like the new world order they call it
[02:28:44.920 --> 02:28:47.760]  mentally ill I mean I call it willing to be free but they they talk about
[02:28:47.760 --> 02:28:53.240]  opposition to it to to authoritarianism is mental illness according to the
[02:28:53.240 --> 02:28:58.720]  federal government worshipping tyranny is good so they should love Stalin and
[02:28:58.720 --> 02:29:04.240]  yeah no he's committing himself to make cases out of their unconstitutional
[02:29:04.240 --> 02:29:09.880]  activity to draw attention to what's happening he's not submitting and so
[02:29:09.880 --> 02:29:13.160]  people can say whatever they want about him and they call it oppositional
[02:29:13.160 --> 02:29:21.720]  defiant disorder so so so he's basically not just going to go along with
[02:29:21.720 --> 02:29:23.840]  everything they're saying and everything they're doing and I wasn't trying to be
[02:29:23.840 --> 02:29:26.880]  sarcastic with you brother it's just I think we're gonna just institute call
[02:29:26.880 --> 02:29:31.400]  screening because I think people want us to screen their calls I appreciate your
[02:29:31.400 --> 02:29:36.080]  call just like half the calls get on and they say I'd like to talk about this

[02:34:14.340 --> 02:34:19.560]  calls right now and just watching America flounder around and you know like
[02:34:19.560 --> 02:34:23.640]  Europe came out a few weeks ago and said out dare the US spy on us with England
[02:34:23.640 --> 02:34:28.600]  and then Snowden of course came out and said they're all completely involved in
[02:34:28.600 --> 02:34:33.240]  an all-sharing data they use Europe to spy on American citizens well that was
[02:34:33.240 --> 02:34:40.760]  in that was in a best-selling book body of secrets with James Bamford in 2001
[02:34:40.760 --> 02:34:46.920]  that was declassified I mean it came out two years ago that the Department of
[02:34:46.920 --> 02:34:54.320]  Defense people listen to Americans having phone sex and that they I mean it's
[02:34:54.320 --> 02:35:00.640]  just insane how do you think wants a job doing that a bunch of perverts and they
[02:35:00.640 --> 02:35:06.400]  use the NSA to go around one time it was 40,000 I think it was 20 something
[02:35:06.400 --> 02:35:10.760]  thousand department defense computers putting child porn on them and it came
[02:35:10.760 --> 02:35:14.920]  out that it'd been put on the computers yeah to go everybody better do what you
[02:35:14.920 --> 02:35:20.440]  say and not complain about missing money and stuff or the child porn was on your
[02:35:20.440 --> 02:35:26.240]  computer I mean it's just we have a total mafia government at the top we're
[02:35:26.240 --> 02:35:30.960]  in deep trouble and I'm up here risking my life to tell you all this that's why
[02:35:30.960 --> 02:35:34.800]  I'm just cutting right to the chase with everybody
[02:35:34.800 --> 02:35:44.640]  I don't even know what to say anymore and I shouldn't let it get to me and
[02:35:44.640 --> 02:35:49.920]  there it is Pentagon reopens investigation into child porn purchases
[02:35:49.920 --> 02:35:56.720]  among its ranks over 250 military personnel civilian con employees and
[02:35:56.720 --> 02:36:01.560]  contractors had been linked to potential child porn purchases that's some
[02:36:01.560 --> 02:36:08.520]  whitewash article what they did was go through like planning on about thousands
[02:36:08.520 --> 02:36:12.640]  and thousands of people's computers that's just ridiculous probably the
[02:36:12.640 --> 02:36:16.920]  people that don't like the fact that the Pentagon's involved with the UN in the
[02:36:16.920 --> 02:36:20.240]  actual trafficking of kids by the way you never hear about investigations of
[02:36:20.240 --> 02:36:25.880]  that or snuff film investigations which are in Europe comes out no it's all who
[02:36:25.880 --> 02:36:32.320]  had the child porn oh and by the way a bunch of media people some of which

[02:37:09.160 --> 02:37:14.800]  of it they got into their line of works they could get their hands on kids not
[02:37:14.800 --> 02:37:21.120]  just pass around the look at the CPS highest rate of child raping why do you
[02:37:21.120 --> 02:37:25.280]  think if you if you ever been to a family court and looked at the people

[02:39:49.160 --> 02:39:52.660]  those cops in Tennessee when they know a camera was on a making fun of him oh he
[02:39:52.660 --> 02:39:57.040]  says he's got a Constitution he says he knows his rights
[02:39:57.040 --> 02:40:05.400]  sorry go ahead I have two questions for you real quick number one last night in
[02:40:05.400 --> 02:40:10.640]  Georgia I ran across the TSA agent in uniform at a Walmart and I had my
[02:40:10.640 --> 02:40:14.480]  camera on my phone and I entered and I sort of did a non-pop to interview how
[02:40:14.480 --> 02:40:19.120]  do I send that to you because this agent says she's totally comfortable with
[02:40:19.120 --> 02:40:23.160]  what she's doing she doesn't care about the Fourth Amendment she doesn't see
[02:40:23.160 --> 02:40:26.560]  anything wrong with it and then when she found out I had the camera on her she
[02:40:26.560 --> 02:40:30.760]  got off it out of shape and I'm like oh so you don't like it do you know what's
[02:40:30.760 --> 02:40:34.840]  the matter you know so how do I send this to you because I know phone audio I
[02:40:34.840 --> 02:40:39.840]  mean phone video clips well when I try to put them on my computer it doesn't you
[02:40:39.840 --> 02:40:44.400]  know download in the format brother go sign up for YouTube and upload that video
[02:40:44.400 --> 02:40:48.000]  straight to YouTube that's how you send it to me when you send it to me you send
[02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:53.080]  it to the world I don't even care about having something exclusive I wallow in
[02:40:53.080 --> 02:40:58.000]  resistance I absolutely hate the New World Order Satan and all of the works
[02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:02.800]  and I just want to defeat these scum so that was the same deal so like I don't
[02:41:02.800 --> 02:41:08.640]  oh yeah they all the cop movies now the good guys violate the Constitution I'm
[02:41:08.640 --> 02:41:12.440]  telling you I saw what's that new movie out it's been on a while it's called
[02:41:12.440 --> 02:41:18.080]  numbers or something we're like there's this thing counting down numbers no no
[02:41:18.080 --> 02:41:21.640]  there's a new movie out I wash it with my wife but I was I went to sleep towards
[02:41:21.640 --> 02:41:24.720]  the end but and then she was watching something else the next day and it had
[02:41:24.720 --> 02:41:27.400]  the same theme basically it's where there's like a computer program where they
[02:41:27.400 --> 02:41:31.720]  put out the numbers for the CIA hit teams to kill people and then it gets
[02:41:31.720 --> 02:41:39.200]  hijacked and I think it's got like John Cusack in it or something but but the
[02:41:39.200 --> 02:41:44.960]  whole point is is the guy kills this like 11 year old girl the CIA boss and
[02:41:44.960 --> 02:41:49.640]  it's good and he's the good guy cuz because he just collateral damage they
[02:41:49.640 --> 02:41:53.720]  go to kill some other CIA guy that just wanted out and so they go kill him and
[02:41:53.720 --> 02:41:58.040]  then the good guy kills his daughter and at the end he's the good guy it's like
[02:41:58.040 --> 02:42:01.720]  our daughters are collateral damage well let me tell you something all you tough
[02:42:01.720 --> 02:42:04.760]  guys that work for the new world order your collateral damage to you idiots
[02:42:04.760 --> 02:42:09.720]  your masters hate your guts I'm sorry caller go ahead one last okay yeah
[02:42:09.720 --> 02:42:12.360]  cuz I thought you had like a show tip line or something but okay I'll try to
[02:42:12.360 --> 02:42:15.960]  get on you to number number two instances like this with Adam Philkesh
[02:42:15.960 --> 02:42:20.920]  okay now I wonder and I asked this question both on the forums and maybe
[02:42:20.920 --> 02:42:24.600]  through your site I mean what are we supposed to do you know we all say okay
[02:42:24.600 --> 02:42:27.000]  they're not gonna get my guns they're not gonna get my guns but when they
[02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:30.320]  overwhelm us like this I mean what exactly are we supposed to do I mean we
[02:42:30.320 --> 02:42:33.960]  can't call a congressman we can't write nobody so when are we gonna stand up I
[02:42:33.960 --> 02:42:38.040]  mean I know you're against you know like I don't know if that's the word again but
[02:42:38.040 --> 02:42:42.400]  I know you don't you know don't support a standing up armed thing but when it's
[02:42:42.400 --> 02:42:46.080]  when it's enough is enough I mean what it's never enough it's not turn all your
[02:42:46.080 --> 02:42:51.040]  guns in drink the fluoride take the shots and kneel to the new world order never
[02:42:51.040 --> 02:42:56.520]  resist them physically worship them only okay well they're gonna come to my
[02:42:56.520 --> 02:42:59.880]  guns to get the bullets that's all I have to say no no I hear you listen listen
[02:42:59.880 --> 02:43:04.200]  you fight them you hear me on air well that's how I'm talking and I'm talking
[02:43:04.200 --> 02:43:08.120]  about how they really are I'm like channeling who these people really are
[02:43:08.120 --> 02:43:12.640]  okay I'm showing people to hopefully wake them up because they already plan on
[02:43:12.640 --> 02:43:16.600]  a full-out war with us they love it they listen a lot of their minions are
[02:43:16.600 --> 02:43:20.600]  willing to die for evil they hate us it's what you've got to understand these
[02:43:20.600 --> 02:43:24.320]  are actually demon-possessed people a lot of more dealing with these are like
[02:43:24.320 --> 02:43:27.840]  you know talk about you know the globalists have drones the devil has
[02:43:27.840 --> 02:43:33.560]  drones and this is what we face and the forces of hell are being are just
[02:43:33.560 --> 02:43:39.040]  beginning to be poured out on us and as a nation as a world we can repent and
[02:43:39.040 --> 02:43:44.320]  and get a reprieve like Nineveh the problem is all the churches basically
[02:43:44.320 --> 02:43:47.560]  the big ones are new all order run teaching them praise God things are
[02:43:47.560 --> 02:43:50.800]  bad it means the end of the world's about to happen we're all gonna be
[02:43:50.800 --> 02:43:55.000]  teleported out of here I appreciate your call sir and I got all this what
[02:43:55.000 --> 02:44:00.400]  happens is I read all this news I get upset by it then I go crazy on air but
[02:44:00.400 --> 02:44:03.880]  I mean it is illegal when they're spying on us it is illegal the stuff they're
[02:44:03.880 --> 02:44:06.680]  doing everywhere but it's like but it's the government who's gonna enforce
[02:44:06.680 --> 02:44:10.640]  against them and that's called tyranny and then you find out they've been
[02:44:10.640 --> 02:44:13.720]  jacking the food in the water and it just gets worse from there and that's
[02:44:13.720 --> 02:44:18.600]  why I don't have any fear of them I'm already living in a crazy land and it
[02:44:18.600 --> 02:44:22.880]  drives me crazy that it just gets worse and worse where are the good people to
[02:44:22.880 --> 02:44:27.000]  start saying no well I'm hearing them I'm hearing them all over talk radio even
[02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:30.720]  though the hosts are trying to manage their audience let's I'm gonna skip this
[02:44:30.720 --> 02:44:34.080]  network break as I got behind here and I shouldn't skip some of these breaks but
[02:44:34.080 --> 02:44:38.000]  whatever here's our interview with Chuck D that the guys went down and got last
[02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:41.520]  week we're premiering in here on the radio right now from public enemy people
[02:44:41.520 --> 02:44:45.000]  say oh why do you care about that they have a lot of fans we wake their fans
[02:44:45.000 --> 02:44:50.120]  up that's how we do this having country music on hip-hop icons on we're
[02:44:50.120 --> 02:44:53.440]  reviewing movies we reach people that are in the matrix that's what this is
[02:44:53.440 --> 02:44:58.720]  but it's an interesting interview as well and I hear it is
[02:45:07.200 --> 02:45:13.320]  you've been educating people for years on on the power fight the power what do
[02:45:13.320 --> 02:45:17.320]  you think is the biggest source of power in the world today the biggest source of
[02:45:17.320 --> 02:45:22.240]  power I think probably the test is knowledge of self and knowledge of your
[02:45:22.240 --> 02:45:25.040]  surrounding but if you have knowledge yourself but you don't know you're
[02:45:25.040 --> 02:45:30.040]  surrounded you kind of like a beginning of the same old boat again the enemy is
[02:45:30.040 --> 02:45:34.720]  always three steps ahead we're trying to gravitate our people at least be a
[02:45:34.720 --> 02:45:41.320]  step behind because enemies treacherous and they come in all shapes forms
[02:45:41.320 --> 02:45:47.760]  alien spirits and we just chose hip-hop as the
[02:45:47.760 --> 02:45:52.280]  meaning was to fight that particular battle and we knew that we knew that once we
[02:45:52.280 --> 02:45:56.720]  was able to do that in hip-hop they would see it as fertile ground you go
[02:45:56.720 --> 02:46:03.280]  back into it but you know that wears off that wears off that the person
[02:46:03.280 --> 02:46:06.400]  very still keep going on not to say that you win the game but you got to make
[02:46:06.400 --> 02:46:13.760]  sure that people don't lose a comment on like the current some of the current
[02:46:13.760 --> 02:46:16.920]  like big acts out there that kind of look like they've sold their soul and
[02:46:16.920 --> 02:46:20.600]  I've even admitted it in certain interviews the big acts have never been
[02:46:20.600 --> 02:46:25.040]  attached to the people in the first place that's why you don't see to us if
[02:46:25.040 --> 02:46:28.440]  you did see a tour you would never see them interact with their public anyway
[02:46:28.440 --> 02:46:32.880]  it's something like it's like it's almost like a ghost so one thing I think I
[02:46:32.880 --> 02:46:36.440]  learned from Griff is that you always got to be aware of ghosting there's a
[02:46:36.440 --> 02:46:40.360]  lot of ghost images when people were believing ghosts in the sky the ground
[02:46:40.360 --> 02:46:45.440]  some book gotta gotta try to get to the physicality of something even the
[02:46:45.440 --> 02:46:50.320]  enemy and break them down to where they are as a being it might not be a human
[02:46:50.320 --> 02:46:54.520]  being but they are being in and in their own goals to be inside you
[02:46:54.520 --> 02:46:59.480]  wrestling well if they want to tell them about that reason going overseas
[02:46:59.480 --> 02:47:05.200]  playing right across the way from the Rolling Stones oh then looking at the
[02:47:05.200 --> 02:47:09.080]  press the next day and you know but we played right in the shadow of the
[02:47:09.080 --> 02:47:12.280]  Rolling Stones and many people this was that Glastonbury biggest festival in the
[02:47:12.280 --> 02:47:18.640]  world and you know I mean this country got all kinds of games my crew had to go
[02:47:18.640 --> 02:47:23.080]  half half the crew could go because we couldn't get out of the states we played
[02:47:23.080 --> 02:47:28.480]  it we made the impact everywhere else of course they acknowledged it back in the
[02:47:28.480 --> 02:47:31.720]  United States not that they didn't acknowledge but they acknowledged
[02:47:31.720 --> 02:47:36.080]  everything else except for what we try to put down I mean simple things like
[02:47:36.080 --> 02:47:41.480]  don't be a dumb smart ass phone simple thing don't have your phone smarter than
[02:47:41.480 --> 02:47:48.440]  you a simple thing so if they're looking at that is being what you call cultural
[02:47:48.440 --> 02:47:54.960]  count contraband then it lets you know where we're at in a society you know I
[02:47:54.960 --> 02:48:00.520]  mean the whole thing was a new world order was the blanket the world and a
[02:48:00.520 --> 02:48:04.560]  philosophy that means everybody's sheep how do you think Obama's gonna fair and
[02:48:04.560 --> 02:48:13.360]  who Obama was way out Obama was on the way out on the way in but it was it was
[02:48:13.360 --> 02:48:17.640]  something for those that had some kind of level of consciousness to use that
[02:48:17.640 --> 02:48:22.840]  time if he's in there to buy some time before a real enemy really comes down
[02:48:22.840 --> 02:48:27.040]  or I should say a thorough enemy that don't give a like basically sending
[02:48:27.040 --> 02:48:32.520]  people to gas chambers legally you know Obama was enough of us facade to be
[02:48:32.520 --> 02:48:38.040]  able to say I got my senses let me give my sight for together my surroundings
[02:48:38.040 --> 02:48:43.240]  together not fall into the hype when he's out of there then the next one that
[02:48:43.240 --> 02:48:47.320]  comes in the question is are we ready for the next person to come to whether
[02:48:47.320 --> 02:48:52.480]  he's pretend to be a ally or whether he's a straight-out adversary like the
[02:48:52.480 --> 02:48:57.760]  push when the push was in he was a straight-out adversary and told you
[02:48:57.760 --> 02:49:03.960]  that we have to look around and our people that is one thing we try to do
[02:49:03.960 --> 02:49:11.800]  in the music I mean it's real simple we believe that culture brings us
[02:49:11.800 --> 02:49:17.280]  together as human beings and devise all governments we feel all government
[02:49:17.280 --> 02:49:22.760]  governments are wicked so governments like to split people up categorize human
[02:49:22.760 --> 02:49:27.480]  beings divide so they can conquer them these people that don't even think that
[02:49:27.480 --> 02:49:30.120]  they can see the world because they need permission to see the planet that
[02:49:30.120 --> 02:49:35.120]  planet Earth a visitor to the planet Earth right music allows you to be a
[02:49:35.120 --> 02:49:39.440]  visitor to the planet Earth way before the internet that's why you know where
[02:49:39.440 --> 02:49:43.280]  we're at just culturally just being able to put the good seeded so a lot of
[02:49:43.280 --> 02:49:46.920]  time when they say well public enemies anti this anti that which is anti
[02:49:46.920 --> 02:49:51.080]  ignorant we've always been about the good seed so somebody has to clearly
[02:49:51.080 --> 02:49:55.640]  define themselves as the the bearer of the bad seed and the bad fruit that go
[02:49:55.640 --> 02:50:00.680]  against public enemy and there hasn't been anybody out there musically or even
[02:50:00.680 --> 02:50:05.440]  in a in a country that has a clear definition or why we're the bad seed
[02:50:05.440 --> 02:50:09.440]  and then a good seed you know we are a bunch of musicians just playing on
[02:50:09.440 --> 02:50:16.360]  Monica people that let's have less acknowledgement getting some credit like
[02:50:16.360 --> 02:50:20.960]  my man professor Griff he instituted a lot of things in rap music and hip hop
[02:50:20.960 --> 02:50:26.080]  that were unprecedented and still not duplicate to this day you know and you
[02:50:26.080 --> 02:50:30.080]  know it's good to see people that worked all these years whether it's
[02:50:30.080 --> 02:50:35.640]  production like exactly guaranteed wins the S1Ws everybody to be acknowledged

[02:50:41.640 --> 02:50:45.520]  effort not that everybody was looking for it we wasn't looking for it became
[02:50:45.520 --> 02:50:51.680]  we felt appreciative you move on if we could take that one if it was a one
[02:50:51.680 --> 02:50:56.440]  trophy and we could break it in 10,000 pieces you best believe we still have
[02:50:56.440 --> 02:50:58.800]  in the mouth

[02:56:36.200 --> 02:56:41.080]  it just I see the bars of the cage I know the global star when I call them a
[02:56:41.080 --> 02:56:48.160]  collection of murdering terrorists and pedophiles and scum and killers that's
[02:56:48.160 --> 02:56:51.920]  who they are I mean I'm like talking to the friends and family of Hastings and
[02:56:51.920 --> 02:56:56.400]  they're all scared to come on except for sergeant staff sergeant bigs and now
[02:56:56.400 --> 02:56:59.360]  the cops have been told you know not to release the police report I mean they
[02:56:59.360 --> 02:57:06.200]  blew that car up that gets to me that that that that freaks me out and I want
[02:57:06.200 --> 02:57:10.320]  to get people awakened and I I tend to throw temper tantrums here on air folks
[02:57:10.320 --> 02:57:14.320]  because when I see the Democrats down there I heard day after day they were
[02:57:14.320 --> 02:57:17.760]  chanting Hail Satan and I should have sent a crew down there I'm like yeah
[02:57:17.760 --> 02:57:21.240]  they're not chanting Hail Satan in the gallery and around and then there's all
[02:57:21.240 --> 02:57:23.840]  these videos day after day they're probably down there right now
[02:57:23.840 --> 02:57:27.800]  chanting Hail Satan but some reporters down there anywhere Christians are at
[02:57:27.800 --> 02:57:34.040]  and pro-lifers are these freaks saying Hail Satan they're just a bunch of scum
[02:57:34.040 --> 02:57:41.360]  and and and why do good people turn everything over to evil you know it's
[02:57:41.360 --> 02:57:44.360]  the old joke of like you know the best-looking girl in school goes out
[02:57:44.360 --> 02:57:48.720]  with the drug dealing thug guy that's flunked four grades because they you
[02:57:48.720 --> 02:57:54.680]  know they they they they misjudge thugism and gangsterism and corruption is
[02:57:54.680 --> 02:58:00.800]  manly when it's the opposite and I guess it's some primitive level maybe
[02:58:00.800 --> 02:58:04.640]  somebody like that might protect you 10,000 years ago I don't know man I'm
[02:58:04.640 --> 02:58:07.960]  just so sick of the men of this country they're like well what do we do or then
[02:58:07.960 --> 02:58:11.440]  I see the professional class who are all just real self-centered they're all
[02:58:11.440 --> 02:58:13.920]  into what they're doing they're not they're eating healthy food they're
[02:58:13.920 --> 02:58:17.320]  exercising they know about the New World Order but they'll say what are you
[02:58:17.320 --> 02:58:23.040]  gonna do about it public scum they'll never wake up so we just give up to all
[02:58:23.040 --> 02:58:26.920]  the evil so it takes over let me tell all you yuppies and people that know
[02:58:26.920 --> 02:58:30.400]  what's going on but sit there on the bench you're gonna lose everything by
[02:58:30.400 --> 02:58:34.040]  not standing up against this you think you're safe by not speaking out being
[02:58:34.040 --> 02:59:03.400]  involved you're wrong you're mistaken
