[00:00.000 --> 00:09.000]  America and the world is awake!
[00:09.000 --> 00:13.000]  The United Kingdom is gone down!
[00:13.000 --> 00:19.000]  The United Kingdom is a Chinese Communist beacon
[00:19.000 --> 00:23.000]  and a criminal in taxes of the world at night!
[00:23.000 --> 00:27.000]  America is awake and fighting back!
[00:27.000 --> 00:31.000]  America is awake and fighting back!
[00:31.000 --> 00:37.000]  America in 1984 is 1775!
[00:37.000 --> 00:40.000]  It's the last day!
[00:40.000 --> 00:44.000]  It's the last day fighting back!
[00:44.000 --> 00:52.000]  America in 1984 is 1775!
[00:52.000 --> 00:57.000]  Hillary Clinton is an enemy of the American people!
[00:57.000 --> 01:02.000]  Hillary Clinton is an enemy of America!
[01:02.000 --> 01:06.000]  Hillary Clinton is openly calling for censorship
[01:06.000 --> 01:09.000]  of all patriots and nationalists!
[01:09.000 --> 01:13.000]  Hillary Clinton is a criminal who sailed
[01:13.000 --> 01:16.000]  to steal our nation out of the cycle!
[01:16.000 --> 01:20.000]  Hillary Clinton is a criminal!
[01:20.000 --> 01:24.000]  Hillary Clinton will never silence the American people!
[01:24.000 --> 01:27.000]  America is awake!
[01:27.000 --> 01:30.000]  America knows what's happening!
[01:30.000 --> 01:34.000]  And FIRs.com is exposing it!
[01:34.000 --> 01:36.000]  America is back!
[01:36.000 --> 01:38.000]  America is back!
[01:38.000 --> 01:40.000]  America is back!
[01:40.000 --> 01:42.000]  America is back!
[01:42.000 --> 01:44.000]  America is back!
[01:44.000 --> 01:47.000]  America is back!
[01:47.000 --> 01:52.000]  America is back!
[01:52.000 --> 02:02.000]  America is back!
[02:02.000 --> 02:07.000]  America is back!
[02:07.000 --> 02:10.000]  America is back!
[02:10.000 --> 02:16.000]  America is back!
[02:16.000 --> 02:20.000]  Hillary Clinton is involved with Jeffrey Epstein.
[02:20.000 --> 02:24.000]  Hillary Clinton flew on Jeffrey Epstein's pedophile aircraft.
[02:24.000 --> 02:29.000]  Democrats are a force million, the entire American criminal
[02:29.000 --> 02:33.000]  that have failed to silence our speech.
[02:33.000 --> 02:37.000]  Big Tech and the Chicoms and Hillary
[02:37.000 --> 02:42.000]  have failed to silence America's speech.
[02:42.000 --> 02:52.000]  America is back, America is back, America is back, America is back, America is back.
[02:52.000 --> 02:57.000]  Hillary Clinton worked with the Chalmers on Jeffrey Epstein.
[02:57.000 --> 03:01.000]  Hillary Clinton wants to sexualize our children.
[03:01.000 --> 03:04.000]  Hillary Clinton is a war criminal.
[03:04.000 --> 03:09.000]  Hillary Clinton, depending on the law, are going down.
[03:09.000 --> 03:14.000]  Hillary Clinton is a failure. Your Democratic Party is collapsing.
[03:14.000 --> 03:18.000]  Every city you control is collapsing into hell.
[03:18.000 --> 03:22.000]  Everyone is running from the Democrats and their meddling.
[03:22.000 --> 03:30.000]  Your so-called power cut, the Democratic Party that filmed it, the KKK, is going down.
[03:30.000 --> 03:37.000]  The Democrats are KKK, the Democrats are KKK, the Democrats are KKK,
[03:37.000 --> 03:42.000]  the Democrats are KKK, the Democrats are KKK,
[03:42.000 --> 03:45.000]  and look, they hold the Democratic Party to KKK.
[03:45.000 --> 03:51.000]  Down with the KKK, down with the Chukka this way, I'm saying, down with the KKK.
[03:51.000 --> 03:55.000]  And she said, no? Down with the KKK and Hillary.
[03:55.000 --> 03:58.000]  Down with the KKK and Hillary.
[03:58.000 --> 04:01.000]  Down with the Democrats that founded the KKK.
[04:01.000 --> 04:05.000]  Down with the Democrats that founded the KKK.
[04:05.000 --> 04:14.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live broadcasting worldwide on this Thursday worldwide transmission.
[04:14.000 --> 04:21.000]  It is November 7th, 2019. We're going to be here live for the next four hours.
[04:21.000 --> 04:25.000]  And believe me, this is another transmission you cannot miss.
[04:25.000 --> 04:27.000]  They're now admitting they want to impeach Pence.
[04:27.000 --> 04:31.000]  I told you that was next. Once they got Trump into the impeachment process,
[04:31.000 --> 04:36.000]  Bolton is to defy the White House and the separation of powers in the Constitution
[04:36.000 --> 04:39.000]  and testify against Trump in an attempt to sink him.
[04:39.000 --> 04:42.000]  We told you when he was brought in that he was the chief neocon.
[04:42.000 --> 04:44.000]  That's all coming up.
[04:44.000 --> 04:48.000]  We have amazing news on so many fronts that I will tell you about.
[04:48.000 --> 04:53.000]  Fox News reporting, we already told you that there's a cover-up at ABC
[04:53.000 --> 04:55.000]  protecting the Clintons and the child-travelling rings.
[04:55.000 --> 05:00.000]  The dam is breaking, but the enemy is dragging back stay with us.
[05:00.000 --> 05:03.000]  We have strong disagreement on policy grounds,
[05:03.000 --> 05:05.000]  and I hope there's diversity in policy here.
[05:05.000 --> 05:07.000]  I don't care what your views are.
[05:07.000 --> 05:10.000]  I hope you articulate them and defend them and listen and debate them.
[05:10.000 --> 05:12.000]  That's important, but we have something in common.
[05:12.000 --> 05:16.000]  We have a set of values that are at the core of this country that hold this place together.
[05:16.000 --> 05:21.000]  Clinton deep state bag man, Comey, thinks it's funny that he was the leaker
[05:21.000 --> 05:23.000]  and that he lied to Congress in the world.
[05:23.000 --> 05:27.000]  He thinks committing crimes are funny, and he thinks if he acts confident,
[05:27.000 --> 05:33.000]  he won't get indicted. The word is, the criminal investigation is honing in on him.
[05:33.000 --> 05:38.000]  From my new home in New Zealand, I will...
[05:38.000 --> 05:41.000]  Oh, and now suddenly he's talking about moving to New Zealand.
[05:41.000 --> 05:43.000]  Not so fast, criminal.
[05:43.000 --> 05:47.000]  We're going to bring you to justice, and we're going to bring Hillary to justice as well.
[05:47.000 --> 05:52.000]  Because if we don't, you criminals will continue to strike back at your enemy.
[05:52.000 --> 06:00.000]  But the American people know how much you hate us, and we're fighting back at infowars.com, newswars.com, and band.video.
[06:22.000 --> 06:43.000]  It was days like this that I was born for.
[06:43.000 --> 06:46.000]  And it was days like this that you were born for.
[06:46.000 --> 06:49.000]  You weren't supposed to be on the air by now.
[06:49.000 --> 06:58.000]  You were supposed to have given up. You were supposed to have rolled over and crawled into the ash heap of history.
[06:58.000 --> 07:02.000]  But we're not climbing into any of those ditches willingly.
[07:02.000 --> 07:08.000]  And if the globalists think they're going to drag us down with them, they've got another thing coming.
[07:08.000 --> 07:13.000]  It's this animating contest that makes us who we are.
[07:13.000 --> 07:19.000]  It is November 7th, 2019 on this Thursday. Transmission is 2019.
[07:19.000 --> 07:22.000]  It becomes very long in the tooth, morally.
[07:22.000 --> 07:32.000]  200 years and 40 something plus since the founding of our nation.
[07:32.000 --> 07:44.000]  And it's either going to be reborn, or it's going to fall, and that great contest is happening right now in front of the world.
[07:44.000 --> 07:54.000]  And we're only 361 days out from this beyond critical election.
[07:54.000 --> 08:09.000]  The full energy of the deep state, the foreign governments, the chai comms being thrown against, we the people, and our attempt to restore at least sovereignty and the people's partial control over our government.
[08:09.000 --> 08:13.000]  Let me tell you just some of what's coming up today.
[08:13.000 --> 08:24.000]  They have always intended, once the official impeachment process against Donald John Trump began, which now began, as you know, about a week and a half ago.
[08:24.000 --> 08:37.000]  They have always intended to begin impeachment processes against the vice president.
[08:37.000 --> 08:49.000]  And they have an endless list of people, deep state lawyers and deep state employees at the White House, that will tell whatever amount of lies are needed.
[08:49.000 --> 09:00.000]  Doesn't matter there's never a shred of proof. Doesn't matter that these individuals all ran their mouths on Twitter and said, the coup starts now, we're going to remove the president.
[09:00.000 --> 09:09.000]  Doesn't matter their best buddies with John Podesta and tweet out how much they love to go to Disney World alone and look at little girls.
[09:09.000 --> 09:17.000]  Oh, that's coming up because the controlled corporate press will be in their corner working hard to cover it up.
[09:17.000 --> 09:31.000]  That's why things are so critical because it was beyond the Fight Club yesterday.
[09:31.000 --> 09:33.000]  I went downtown.
[09:33.000 --> 09:38.000]  We ordered him about a week ago. The banners came in.
[09:38.000 --> 09:43.000]  The video is up on infowars.com from the live feeds. The HD is coming this afternoon.
[09:43.000 --> 09:48.000]  I went down there. The rob dude dresses the grim reaper.
[09:48.000 --> 09:59.000]  And I went down to Google headquarters on Second Street with a sign saying Epstein did not kill himself.
[09:59.000 --> 10:02.000]  Epstein was murdered.
[10:02.000 --> 10:13.000]  Epstein killed me wrong and almost no one disagreed with me and it was like Fight Club and we're walking back to the vehicles through the city who couldn't park right there.
[10:13.000 --> 10:26.000]  I had old black men, young white men, Asian women, Hispanic police officers say Epstein was murdered by the deep state.
[10:26.000 --> 10:35.000]  You're right about the pedophile rings. You're right about the Clintons and leftist. We're going, that's right, Hillary's evil. You're right, Alex Jones.
[10:35.000 --> 10:42.000]  I was first screaming at Google about their complicity. The employees poured out at five o'clock and they all were coming over saying stop yelling at us. We agree with you.
[10:42.000 --> 10:49.000]  I probably get fired but I don't care. You're right. We think it's wrong. You got taken off Google.
[10:49.000 --> 10:56.000]  So it was really incredible, ladies and gentlemen, and we're going to have that footage for you by the end of the show today.
[10:56.000 --> 11:03.000]  But we had a four camera shoot. By tomorrow we should have a nice short boil down for the broadcast.
[11:03.000 --> 11:12.000]  But you know, we went out and protested Hillary this weekend and by the next morning we had a nice five minute boil down of five cameras going for five hours.
[11:12.000 --> 11:19.000]  Can you imagine how much footage that is? But Rob Do did not sleep our news director. Just means he works the hardest around here.
[11:19.000 --> 11:29.000]  He did not sleep and put out the incredibly viral boil down that I just shared at the first of transmission.
[11:29.000 --> 11:35.000]  So we're fighting hard because history is happening now and every minute is like a year in the past.
[11:35.000 --> 11:46.000]  The amount of change is taking place and the fact is when societies go liquid from their frozen state, it's not just evil that can rearrange things.
[11:46.000 --> 12:00.000]  It's good and we're at the wheel of human development and human destiny battling for control of the ship with the literal forces of death that don't want humans to go to the next level and make it off this planet.
[12:00.000 --> 12:07.000]  The total decision about the species is happening right now in the next 10, 20 years, which is the blinking of an eye.
[12:07.000 --> 12:15.000]  We're in the world government. We're in the cashless society takeover. It's incredible.
[12:15.000 --> 12:27.000]  So it's being announced. House to explore Pence's role in Ukraine controversy with new testimony, new lies all proven, but Pence is next.
[12:27.000 --> 12:39.000]  Bolton willing to defy White House and testify at impeachment inquiry. If court clears the way, he'll be the big star, the big neocon that Trump was told to bring in by McMaster and others despite the fact we warned him.
[12:39.000 --> 12:47.000]  Fiona Hill, all of it. And now he's going to show the world what a big man he is.
[12:47.000 --> 12:53.000]  Yep, I told you they got their knives out for Caesar. That's coming up.
[12:53.000 --> 13:02.000]  And then jury and Roger Stone trial packed with pro Obama anti Trump jurors. The judge completely flipped out yesterday.
[13:02.000 --> 13:08.000]  We've got the exclusive coming up threatening people with contempt threatening to arrest people.
[13:08.000 --> 13:17.000]  If they told the world that she was trying to put a former Obama administration department head on the jury.
[13:17.000 --> 13:24.000]  And she said in court yesterday, well, I'm taking her off now, but there was nothing. There was no impropriety by by me.
[13:24.000 --> 13:29.000]  Oh, no, you just tried to keep a secret. She did kick the media out, cut the feed into the media room.
[13:29.000 --> 13:37.000]  That's a video feed yesterday and flipped out threatening everybody. I've talked to people that were threatened.
[13:37.000 --> 13:44.000]  She lets anti stone protesters up at the courthouse, but bans anybody pro stone. This is beyond kangaroo court.
[13:44.000 --> 13:53.000]  She's building a railroad right out of that courtroom, that kangaroo event that zoo right to the federal prison.
[13:53.000 --> 14:00.000]  She's snorting and laughing and cackling. Tucker Carlson talked about it last night and now they're crapping their britches.
[14:00.000 --> 14:08.000]  It media matters and BuzzFeed saying I threatened the jury and I need to be arrested because I had a grim reaper on the show.
[14:08.000 --> 14:17.000]  The grim reaper was about Epstein. Everyone knows that and you're a pack of liars. It's why they wouldn't link to the supposed death threat with the grim reaper.
[14:17.000 --> 14:29.000]  Why the hell would I try to threaten some jury that I'm not a thug like them. Plus, I think like I think I think if somebody threatened me, I'd be more hardcore.
[14:29.000 --> 14:39.000]  What a load of malarkey. But that's a big national story. And then the left is salivating drooling. Oh, that's Jones. Oh, get him.
[14:39.000 --> 14:44.000]  And everyone's too scared to even get into who these juries are with the Supreme Court rules. You have a right to know who the damn jurors are.
[14:44.000 --> 14:55.000]  But see, basic rights are criminal now. Free speech is under assault and every protection. But wait, it gets worse.
[14:55.000 --> 15:06.000]  We're going to have Jacob Ingalls on who was threatened by the judge yesterday. We're going to have Robert Barnes coming up bottom of the hour, both of them together.
[15:06.000 --> 15:17.000]  But when I come back, I'm going to get to the other news in detail. I haven't told you about yet. It's all on infowars.com. It's all on newswars.com.
[15:17.000 --> 15:26.000]  You literally get tomorrow's news today. It's all confirmed that the Clintons ran the blackmail ring. It's on Fox News now. The whole house of cards is coming down.
[15:26.000 --> 15:40.000]  And it ties into Podesta and the lawyer for the fake whistleblower who said we're going to have a coup against the president. It's all connected.
[15:40.000 --> 15:58.000]  This guy's literally at Disney World by himself, posting about it, drooling, and posting pictures of little girls. I mean, these people are unbelievable.

[17:19.000 --> 17:38.000]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house. I sued the IRS in one. I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[17:38.000 --> 17:50.000]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved. I can help you too. If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day. There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[17:50.000 --> 18:09.000]  Call 800-34-no-tax or go to my website, danpilla.com, that's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[18:20.000 --> 18:30.000]  I'm Dan Pilla, and I'll see you in the next video.
[18:50.000 --> 19:00.000]  I'm Dan Pilla, and I'll see you in the next video.
[19:20.000 --> 19:30.000]  I'm Dan Pilla, and I'll see you in the next video.
[19:51.000 --> 20:00.000]  2 billion are mentally retarded on the face of the earth right now because of iodine deficiency. Research it and find out for yourself now.
[20:00.000 --> 20:03.000]  Infowars dot com.
[20:03.000 --> 20:22.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:22.000 --> 20:34.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[20:53.000 --> 21:12.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we have a conflagration, an alignment of news that really illustrates the type of planet we're on and the battle between the forces of oppression and tyranny and those that want due process and common sense systems and a prosperous world.
[21:12.000 --> 21:26.000]  The American ideal versus the imperial ideals of the past, a real struggle is coming to a head. America was basically lost the final days of its sovereignty going under globalist bondage.
[21:26.000 --> 21:45.000]  Trump got elected thanks to your actions and others. Other patriots are getting elected around the world, but the globalist counter strike is massive. And if they can convince people that if they're able to knock out some folks like myself or Trump or the Brexit that they've won, if people give up, they could win.
[21:45.000 --> 21:56.000]  But if you realize that resistance is victory and taking action against their corruption is victory and that their policies and that their systems are untenable, they will be defeated one way or the other.
[21:56.000 --> 22:10.000]  It may take 10 years to get rid of Brexit. Before Brexit ever passed, I said they'll try a bunch of scams to keep them from leaving for a few years, hoping you give up because I'd seen what they'd done with other countries that tried to get out of the EU that never voted to enter the EU either.
[22:10.000 --> 22:23.000]  So this is a long haul. And it's about the animating contest of liberty. And it's just like where you quit working out for a few years and then get back into it. And you say to yourself, man, this is really hard.
[22:23.000 --> 22:34.000]  This is horrible. But once you do it for a few months, you're like, this is fun. This feels good. I'm addicted. You realize that it's what builds up your muscles, your lungs, your blood volume. It's what makes you stronger.
[22:34.000 --> 22:46.000]  So Thomas Jefferson called it the animating contest of liberty. And that's what this is, is the animating contest of liberty.
[22:46.000 --> 22:53.000]  Now, Robert Barnes is going to be riding shotgun with us for over an hour today. Then I'm going to continue with phone calls and news after that.
[22:53.000 --> 23:06.000]  But I didn't get finished mentioning the news that's coming up. I've only so far gotten into, of course, now they want to impeach Pence as well. I said once they initiated the fake impeachment, they would drag him into it.
[23:06.000 --> 23:16.000]  Bolton, I said, was the main organizer of the neocons working with the left. Now he's coming out against Trump is going to testify willingly to try to get around the separation of powers and executive privilege.
[23:16.000 --> 23:29.000]  He's saying corruption is you're supposed to be able to get around that unprecedented. We have huge news on how they're rigging the whole trial and railroading stone and the craziness that we've seen come out of the court and the disinfo.
[23:29.000 --> 23:37.000]  That's a massive claiming I'm death threaded the jurors when the Daily Beast did that through my name by building a straw man next level fraud.
[23:37.000 --> 23:49.000]  But we have the even bigger news of even Fox News investigative journalists and others reporting. It's about the Clintons. It's about a massive cover up with Epstein and the wheels beginning to come off.
[23:49.000 --> 23:56.000]  And then the whistleblowers attorney who said three years ago once Trump was president elect, the coup starts now.
[23:56.000 --> 24:07.000]  And now he's over the so called 35 year old whistleblower on his YouTube channel and it's his YouTube channel drooling over young Disney girls.
[24:07.000 --> 24:14.000]  And then saying he goes to Disney World by himself to admire things and how his big friends with John Podesta.
[24:14.000 --> 24:26.000]  This is really grabbed the Internet massively. I've had a lot of big, well known personalities media text me and call me today saying, wow, Jones, you're absolutely right.
[24:26.000 --> 24:41.000]  It really is a culture, a cult of these type of folks. And then meanwhile, that ties into everything that is unfolding with Joy Behar defending calling anyone who doesn't like Hillary, a Russian agent to
[24:41.000 --> 24:52.000]  gabbers to her face. That's all coming up as well. Bill Gates having to defend himself for lying about being best buddies with Jeffrey Epstein.
[24:52.000 --> 24:57.000]  The House of Cards is coming down. But as it's coming down for every action, there's an opposite equal reaction.
[24:57.000 --> 25:05.000]  Trump is in trouble. We're seeing elections lost in Kentucky, Virginia, real bellwethers in battleground areas.
[25:05.000 --> 25:12.000]  And so it's on. This is an incredible time to be alive. But it's a period victory. They take Trump out. They're still going down.
[25:12.000 --> 25:19.000]  The question is how nasty will this be? Robert Barnes, constitutional lawyer, you've been behind the scenes last day with a lot of the disinfo that's out.
[25:19.000 --> 25:22.000]  We'll cover it next segment. But what would you call what's currently happening?
[25:22.000 --> 25:32.000]  Well, you see parallels. For example, today you had someone on the view who said she was a lawyer, had a law degree, illegally tell Donald Trump Jr.
[25:32.000 --> 25:39.000]  that it's illegal to disclose the identity of the fake whistleblower, when in fact what's illegal is to threaten people in that manner.
[25:39.000 --> 25:48.000]  The law only prohibits the inspector general and certain specific government officials from disclosing the name of the whistleblower.
[25:48.000 --> 25:56.000]  This being a fake whistleblower, in this case in particular, does not prohibit members of the public from identifying and members of the press identifying.
[25:56.000 --> 26:05.000]  And this fits a broader pattern. Remember when the media lied and told people, oh, Andrew Cuomo at CNN said, or not Andrew Cuomo, but his brother said that no.
[26:05.000 --> 26:06.000]  Chris Cuomo.
[26:06.000 --> 26:10.000]  Yeah, exactly. When Chris Cuomo, Frito, I think, isn't as popular as his name.
[26:10.000 --> 26:11.000]  Frito is his name.
[26:11.000 --> 26:18.000]  Frito, yeah, I think he likes that name. When he told people, hey, you can't look at WikiLeaks unless we CNN show it to you, that would be illegal.
[26:18.000 --> 26:27.000]  And then, of course, now we have the disclosure of the whistleblower, who shows the whole impeachment is a fraud, and what people, what's the lawyer on the view doing, threatening Donald Trump Jr.
[26:27.000 --> 26:31.000]  And really, threatening everyone else. Oh, it's illegal to disclose or discuss the name of the whistleblower.
[26:31.000 --> 26:42.000]  And then we have that parallel by Will Sommer and the Daily Beast lying to people today saying it's illegal to disclose the name of a juror or that constitutes juror harassment in their false story.
[26:42.000 --> 26:45.000]  That's right. It's illegal to read WikiLeaks, which it's not.
[26:45.000 --> 26:49.000]  It's illegal to talk about public jurors that are Obama officials, which it's not.
[26:49.000 --> 26:52.000]  It's illegal to say who the whistleblower is, who it turned out was already a witness.
[26:52.000 --> 26:59.000]  As we predicted, his lawyer is an absolute destroy Trump, taking down John Podesta official.
[26:59.000 --> 27:05.000]  Oh, in fact, I've been debating that guy for two years, because I exposed him back in 2017, because I exposed his Podesta.
[27:05.000 --> 27:06.000]  Zade.
[27:06.000 --> 27:10.000]  Mark Zade. I exposed his Podesta connections, which he then ran from.
[27:10.000 --> 27:16.000]  He created an organization that he called the George Washington Organization, where he was putting himself out as a Freedom of Information Act lawyer.
[27:16.000 --> 27:21.000]  And I researched it and it turned out, or it was either, maybe it was the James Madison Organization.
[27:21.000 --> 27:25.000]  And it turned out the organization didn't really have 501c filings that I could find.
[27:25.000 --> 27:28.000]  And then I see John Podesta is listed on the advisory board.
[27:28.000 --> 27:32.000]  So when I point this out, he suddenly says, oh, no, no, he's nonpartisan.
[27:32.000 --> 27:34.000]  He hasn't really even talked to Podesta.
[27:34.000 --> 27:40.000]  He wasn't even aware he was on the advisory board.
[27:40.000 --> 27:42.000]  Wait till we show you his Twitter and his YouTube channel.
[27:42.000 --> 27:45.000]  It's literally little girls.
[27:45.000 --> 27:49.000]  And then he goes, I love you, Disney World, by myself.
[27:49.000 --> 27:51.000]  And then he's buddies with Podesta.
[27:51.000 --> 27:53.000]  And then he's trying to take Trump down.
[27:53.000 --> 27:55.000]  I mean, this is very interesting.
[27:55.000 --> 27:57.000]  He was notably any Trump from the get-go.
[27:57.000 --> 27:59.000]  And he was trying to feign to be nonpartisan.
[27:59.000 --> 28:01.000]  And he's the lawyer for the so-called whistleblower.
[28:01.000 --> 28:05.000]  Oh, he came after me early on because I was questioning aspects of what was happening.
[28:05.000 --> 28:07.000]  And he said that he was a national security law expert.
[28:07.000 --> 28:09.000]  And I was like, what is that?
[28:09.000 --> 28:11.000]  Because there's no national security law class.
[28:11.000 --> 28:13.000]  Hey, look, the top 10 Disney girls.
[28:13.000 --> 28:15.000]  Oh, look, Selena Gomez is a child.
[28:15.000 --> 28:18.000]  But you've got to see him at Disney World.
[28:18.000 --> 28:21.000]  What's interesting is, you know, he has clearly been part of the left,
[28:21.000 --> 28:26.000]  or particularly the anti-Trump crowd, legally, has tried to put off the impression that he's not.
[28:26.000 --> 28:27.000]  And that was my point.
[28:27.000 --> 28:29.000]  My point was, look, hey, if you want to be anti-Trump, that's fine.
[28:29.000 --> 28:30.000]  That's your business.
[28:30.000 --> 28:31.000]  But admit that.
[28:31.000 --> 28:33.000]  Don't go around pretending it to be otherwise.
[28:33.000 --> 28:34.000]  And he was coming after me.
[28:34.000 --> 28:35.000]  And then they were coming after me.
[28:35.000 --> 28:36.000]  And they were talking about trial law.
[28:36.000 --> 28:39.000]  And it turned out they had very little trial law experience I could find.
[28:39.000 --> 28:41.000]  So I was like, well, what in the world are you guys trying to do?
[28:41.000 --> 28:44.000]  So they were trying to have a monopoly over a particular part of this.
[28:44.000 --> 28:51.000]  Well, we're going to look into this young man and his little whistleblower today and so much more.
[28:51.000 --> 28:57.000]  And we've got Jacob Ingalls from outside the courthouse in DC.
[28:57.000 --> 28:59.000]  Stay with us.
[28:59.000 --> 29:04.000]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[29:04.000 --> 29:06.000]  You don't know me and we'll never meet.
[29:06.000 --> 29:08.000]  I had a problem like you once.
[29:08.000 --> 29:14.000]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life.
[29:14.000 --> 29:19.000]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[29:19.000 --> 29:24.000]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone,
[29:24.000 --> 29:27.000]  you need to call the National Treatment Advisors.
[29:27.000 --> 29:32.000]  They'll immerse you into a 30-day program to replace your old habits with new habits

[30:06.000 --> 30:09.000]  Some of us are deficient in some things and not in others.
[30:09.000 --> 30:13.000]  There's a lot of factors that go into this and I'm not telling you something that you don't know,
[30:13.000 --> 30:15.000]  but I'm here to tell you.
[30:15.000 --> 30:22.000]  Every time I commit and use the supplements that we sell on a religious basis,

[30:27.000 --> 30:29.000]  I look better. Everybody notices.

[32:25.000 --> 32:29.000]  1.47 is the cost with free shipping. They've never done a deal that good.
[32:29.000 --> 32:32.000]  It's a hot item. They sell tens of thousands of these a year.
[32:32.000 --> 32:37.000]  It's a four-stage ion cluster. Other competing brands are $400, $500, $600, $700.
[32:37.000 --> 32:39.000]  All the markup.
[32:39.000 --> 32:43.000]  No, ladies and gentlemen, we usually sell these all day long for $250. They're a great deal.
[32:43.000 --> 32:49.000]  1.47, I almost, I've told the guy, like, this cuts into the market, so I'm just slow.
[32:49.000 --> 32:50.000]  People don't appreciate it.
[32:50.000 --> 32:52.000]  Well, this is what the InfoWars audience gets.
[32:52.000 --> 32:56.000]  At InfoWarsTour.com, there's only a few hundred of these left at this price,
[32:56.000 --> 33:25.000]  and then more don't come in until next year.
[33:26.000 --> 33:29.000]  You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he.
[33:29.000 --> 33:37.000]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[33:37.000 --> 33:42.000]  Well, tomorrow's news today, we've been telling you since Monday,
[33:42.000 --> 33:46.000]  the latest kangaroo court activities going on at Roger Stone's trial,
[33:46.000 --> 33:54.000]  and a lot of Tucker Carlson's broadcast transmission last night was dealing with this,
[33:54.000 --> 33:59.000]  and there's been even bigger developments that we're able to give you since then.
[33:59.000 --> 34:01.000]  So we're going to be hitting that here in just a moment.
[34:01.000 --> 34:06.000]  Please remember, we're only on air able to expose the Clinton child kidnapping network
[34:06.000 --> 34:10.000]  that's coming down right now, and able to expose all the judicial tyranny,
[34:10.000 --> 34:13.000]  and able to expose the globalists trying to impeach our president,
[34:13.000 --> 34:18.000]  and the deep state's lies, and who these whistleblowers are, and who their lawyers are.
[34:18.000 --> 34:23.000]  Just incredible stuff coming up next hour because of your support.
[34:23.000 --> 34:26.000]  Plus, these are products you really need.
[34:26.000 --> 34:29.000]  And so it isn't a gimmick where I say, hey, this sale's got to end by Monday,
[34:29.000 --> 34:32.000]  and it's still here on Thursday. I've been fighting so hard,
[34:32.000 --> 34:36.000]  and I was up here again till eight o'clock last night, nine o'clock at night before,
[34:36.000 --> 34:39.000]  10 o'clock at night before, and I'm glad to be doing it.
[34:39.000 --> 34:46.000]  I was up at home at midnight last night working, jumped out of bed at 5 a.m.
[34:46.000 --> 34:50.000]  There's so much happening. I've never had this much energy.
[34:50.000 --> 34:53.000]  I was energy when I was 20 because history's happening now,
[34:53.000 --> 34:56.000]  and you can feel the energy in the air,
[34:56.000 --> 34:59.000]  and you can see how our actions are affecting things.
[34:59.000 --> 35:01.000]  Evil isn't the only thing that has power in the universe.
[35:01.000 --> 35:06.000]  Good people have more power. We just never exercise it, but we are now.
[35:06.000 --> 35:10.000]  So the great change is upon us, and good always has to catch up to the evil,
[35:10.000 --> 35:12.000]  but the end, evil ends up going down.
[35:12.000 --> 35:14.000]  So infowarstore.com.
[35:14.000 --> 35:16.000]  After the show today, I've got to get together with the crew.
[35:16.000 --> 35:19.000]  Look at what products we've got left, what's coming in.
[35:19.000 --> 35:21.000]  What the new specials will be.
[35:21.000 --> 35:24.000]  But this Everything Must Go sale has been one of the most expansive.
[35:24.000 --> 35:27.000]  It was quite frankly bigger than the sale before the last,
[35:27.000 --> 35:30.000]  but it loses its effect when you just say that.
[35:30.000 --> 35:31.000]  It's the truth.
[35:31.000 --> 35:32.000]  40-70% off.
[35:32.000 --> 35:36.000]  Store-wide for shipping, double-patriot points, sign-up for auto-ship.
[35:36.000 --> 35:38.000]  On the order you're doing.
[35:38.000 --> 35:41.000]  Additional 10% off on that order.
[35:41.000 --> 35:43.000]  A lot of folks canceled that.
[35:43.000 --> 35:44.000]  You can't. It's free.
[35:44.000 --> 35:46.000]  Take advantage of the 10% off on top of it.
[35:46.000 --> 35:48.000]  Most of you don't, and you take the next order that comes in,
[35:48.000 --> 35:52.000]  but we only mark things up 150%.
[35:52.000 --> 35:55.000]  And then we always discount to 100% markup.
[35:55.000 --> 35:59.000]  And then right now we're making like 50%, 30% on some things.
[35:59.000 --> 36:03.000]  It's lost leaders, but I want you to see how great the products are.
[36:03.000 --> 36:06.000]  And so Vasovitch is about to sell out.
[36:06.000 --> 36:08.000]  Ultra 12 is about to sell out.
[36:08.000 --> 36:09.000]  Super strong.
[36:09.000 --> 36:10.000]  That'll be 12.
[36:10.000 --> 36:11.000]  Taking under the tongue.
[36:11.000 --> 36:13.000]  Best you're going to find out there.
[36:13.000 --> 36:17.000]  We've got things like X2 and X3 with Selenium in the iodine challenge.
[36:17.000 --> 36:19.000]  That is 60% off.
[36:19.000 --> 36:21.000]  That's going to have to end soon.
[36:21.000 --> 36:22.000]  Infowarstore.com.
[36:22.000 --> 36:23.000]  Only 48 hours left.

[36:51.000 --> 36:54.000]  We've got a new product that's been in for a week in the warehouse.
[36:54.000 --> 36:55.000]  That it's going to be revolutionary.
[36:55.000 --> 36:57.000]  Haven't cut the ads for it.
[36:57.000 --> 37:01.000]  I have been busier than a one-legged man in an ass kicking contest.
[37:01.000 --> 37:04.000]  So we have the Trump is innocent t-shirts.
[37:04.000 --> 37:06.000]  Those just got in.
[37:06.000 --> 37:07.000]  We're selling them at cost.
[37:07.000 --> 37:10.000]  They're high quality fabric, high quality printing.
[37:10.000 --> 37:12.000]  Printed right here in Texas.
[37:12.000 --> 37:14.000]  The shirt costs us right at $10.
[37:14.000 --> 37:17.000]  Shipping on average is $5.
[37:17.000 --> 37:18.000]  No reviews yet.
[37:18.000 --> 37:19.000]  It just came out.
[37:19.000 --> 37:20.000]  So it's $14.95.
[37:20.000 --> 37:22.000]  Because right now we have free shipping.
[37:22.000 --> 37:29.000]  As soon as there's not the free shipping at this weekend, it's going to be $10.
[37:29.000 --> 37:31.000]  But it's still the same thing as you'll pay $5 shipping and handling.
[37:31.000 --> 37:33.000]  So get Trump is innocent.
[37:33.000 --> 37:34.000]  We need to get this shirt out.
[37:34.000 --> 37:35.000]  It needs to go viral.
[37:35.000 --> 37:37.000]  We need to stand up for our free speech.
[37:37.000 --> 38:06.600]  The
[38:06.600 --> 38:12.080]  It's really legislative tyranny, acting on judicial with the fake impeachment situation.
[38:12.080 --> 38:14.400]  Here's Tucker Carlson, part of the show last night.
[38:14.400 --> 38:15.680]  The video's on enforce.com.
[38:15.680 --> 38:16.680]  Share it.
[38:16.680 --> 38:17.680]  Paul Watson wrote about it.
[38:17.680 --> 38:20.560]  Knocking it out of the park.
[38:20.560 --> 38:21.960]  Here it is.
[38:21.960 --> 38:25.960]  The Russia collusion hoax collapsed under the weight of its own absurdity earlier this
[38:25.960 --> 38:27.280]  year, as you know.
[38:27.280 --> 38:31.560]  And yet, amazingly, it is still claiming victims to this day.
[38:31.560 --> 38:34.280]  Roger Stone went on trial in Washington this week.
[38:34.280 --> 38:37.760]  Officially, Stone is being charged with lying to Congress.
[38:37.760 --> 38:42.080]  That's bitterly amusing, if you think about it, given that Congress cannot be charged with
[38:42.080 --> 38:45.000]  lying to you, which it does constantly.
[38:45.000 --> 38:47.800]  But in Washington, everyone understands that's just a pretext.
[38:47.800 --> 38:52.280]  Roger Stone's real crime was giving Donald Trump political advice for 30 years.
[38:52.280 --> 38:55.240]  For that, he faces life behind bars.
[38:55.240 --> 38:59.280]  One person who clearly understands what's actually happening, and strongly approves of
[38:59.280 --> 39:03.040]  it, is the presiding judge in the case, Amy Berman Jackson.
[39:03.040 --> 39:08.320]  Jackson is an Obama appointee, and she's transparently and aggressively political.
[39:08.320 --> 39:14.280]  Months ago, Jackson prohibited Roger Stone from publicly defending himself in the case.
[39:14.280 --> 39:19.880]  CNN and MSNBC were free to continue to slander Stone, and of course, they relentlessly did
[39:19.880 --> 39:20.880]  that.
[39:20.880 --> 39:26.280]  But if Stone said a single word in his own defense, Jackson vowed to put him behind bars.
[39:26.280 --> 39:29.720]  Now, how could Jackson do that in a country with the First Amendment?
[39:29.720 --> 39:31.240]  Well, she couldn't.
[39:31.240 --> 39:36.120]  It's blatantly unconstitutional, but Donald Trump is hated here in Washington, so nobody
[39:36.120 --> 39:37.600]  stopped her.
[39:37.600 --> 39:41.280]  Jackson just did it anyway, just like in the Third World.
[39:41.280 --> 39:45.520]  Jackson's behavior in court has turned out to be even more ludicrous and unprofessional,
[39:45.520 --> 39:46.920]  assuming that's possible.
[39:46.920 --> 39:52.240]  At times, she has literally rolled her eyes and snorted at Stone, suggesting he's guilty
[39:52.240 --> 39:54.360]  before the trial even started.
[39:54.360 --> 39:56.680]  Her judgments have been transparently political.
[39:56.680 --> 40:01.080]  Yesterday, for example, during jury selection, one of the prospective jurors turned out to
[40:01.080 --> 40:06.920]  be a former press secretary in the Obama administration, who admitted that she despises Donald Trump
[40:06.920 --> 40:11.800]  and has friends in the federal prosecutor's office, which is trying the case.
[40:11.800 --> 40:16.160]  Her husband, meanwhile, works at the Justice Department, which is prosecuting Roger Stone.
[40:16.160 --> 40:21.000]  The woman claims she had followed the Mueller investigation closely, but somehow had never
[40:21.000 --> 40:27.040]  quote read or heard anything about Roger Stone's case and didn't have a strong opinion about
[40:27.040 --> 40:28.040]  him.
[40:28.040 --> 40:29.040]  Uh-huh.
[40:29.040 --> 40:31.560]  No sober person could take that claim seriously.
[40:31.560 --> 40:33.040]  But Amy Berman Jackson did.
[40:33.040 --> 40:36.280]  She acted like it was all completely fine and on the level.
[40:36.280 --> 40:42.040]  When Roger Stone's lawyers asked that that woman be removed from the jury pool, Jackson
[40:42.040 --> 40:43.040]  refused.
[40:43.040 --> 40:48.480]  Personal conflicts, she said, were quote, not automatically disqualifying.
[40:48.480 --> 40:52.880]  But ought to be automatically disqualifying is Amy Berman Jackson's behavior from the
[40:52.880 --> 40:53.800]  bench.
[40:53.800 --> 40:56.200]  No fair person could condone it.
[40:56.200 --> 41:00.040]  If they were still honest liberals left in this country, they would be protesting outside
[41:00.040 --> 41:01.040]  the courtroom.
[41:01.040 --> 41:06.000]  Well, Tucker Carlson just threatened the jury.
[41:06.000 --> 41:07.280]  That's what the Daily Beast said about me.
[41:07.280 --> 41:13.280]  I just pointed that same thing out yesterday from the witnesses and Daily Beast, media
[41:13.280 --> 41:19.040]  matters, they're all just, oh my God, Alex Jones threatened the jurors because we had
[41:19.040 --> 41:22.960]  a grim reaper on the show talking about Jeffrey Epstein had no connection, but they don't
[41:22.960 --> 41:24.160]  show that to you.
[41:24.160 --> 41:25.160]  They just lie.
[41:25.160 --> 41:26.160]  Oh, no doubt about it.
[41:26.160 --> 41:30.640]  I mean, what's fascinating is there's been a lot of liberal celebrate, you know, a lot
[41:30.640 --> 41:35.680]  of them celebrating various aspects of the Texas cases that are expanding the definition
[41:35.680 --> 41:38.000]  of various theories of libel and whatnot.
[41:38.000 --> 41:41.840]  Just in order to go at you, well, I guess they don't realize those same theories can
[41:41.840 --> 41:43.320]  apply to their conduct.
[41:43.320 --> 41:48.640]  And so what happened here is Will Sommer, who writes for the Daily Beast, basically stated
[41:48.640 --> 41:51.560]  in the article things that were just not true.
[41:51.560 --> 41:55.680]  And so you have a First Amendment right and the American people have a First Amendment
[41:55.680 --> 42:01.680]  right to know who is participating in a jury, to make sure that jury is impartial and make
[42:01.680 --> 42:06.200]  sure that jury is not prejudicial and make sure that jury has no bias.
[42:06.200 --> 42:11.320]  It is in fact the duty and obligation of the American public to observe court proceedings,
[42:11.320 --> 42:15.720]  to ensure they comply with our constitutional rights and our sense of fairness and integrity
[42:15.720 --> 42:17.520]  in the judicial process.
[42:17.520 --> 42:22.720]  This is why it is the U.S. Supreme Court determined more than 30 years ago, based on centuries
[42:22.720 --> 42:27.700]  of common law tradition in American and Anglo-Saxon legal tradition, going back even before the
[42:27.700 --> 42:32.840]  Norman conquest, that there is a right of public participation in the jury trial process.
[42:32.840 --> 42:34.600]  And so that's part one of what's taking place.
[42:34.600 --> 42:40.160]  The other part of what he did was he threw in the reference that you had had the death
[42:40.160 --> 42:43.520]  symbolized during the broadcast and tried to imply that it had something to do with
[42:43.520 --> 42:44.520]  the jurors.
[42:44.520 --> 42:45.520]  It had nothing to do with this though.
[42:45.520 --> 42:47.240]  We said it has to do with Epstein.
[42:47.240 --> 42:48.240]  Absolutely.
[42:48.240 --> 42:51.920]  It was clearly, it was about an ongoing need that Epstein did not know.
[42:51.920 --> 42:52.920]  And they know that.
[42:52.920 --> 42:53.920]  That's why they didn't show what we did.
[42:53.920 --> 43:01.040]  They just said, he had the Grim Reaper on, he threatened to kill him, arrest him.
[43:01.040 --> 43:04.480]  Folks asked me, Alex, why do you have two different types of iodine?
[43:04.480 --> 43:10.120]  Well, that's because different types of physiology, different types of metabolic systems and
[43:10.120 --> 43:12.600]  different people will like different formulas.
[43:12.600 --> 43:15.160]  It's just that simple.
[43:15.160 --> 43:20.200]  X3 is the deep earth crystal iodine and two other types because some people need all three
[43:20.200 --> 43:21.680]  types to absorb.
[43:21.680 --> 43:24.840]  Others like the pure atomic iodine.
[43:24.840 --> 43:25.840]  Get both.
[43:25.840 --> 43:30.120]  They're both great for you, whichever one you like, use that and give the other to family
[43:30.120 --> 43:31.120]  or friends.
[43:31.120 --> 43:33.640]  Bottom line, iodine is essential.
[43:33.640 --> 43:34.880]  That's why I harp on it.
[43:34.880 --> 43:39.200]  The globalist want you to be deficient in it for a lot of reasons.
[43:39.200 --> 43:41.240]  More IQ, makes you sluggish.
[43:41.240 --> 43:42.320]  You don't live as long.
[43:42.320 --> 43:43.320]  It's simple.
[43:43.320 --> 43:49.800]  Get your high quality iodine at infowarstore.com and help fund the info war, infowarstore.com.
[43:49.800 --> 43:52.480]  We've got a huge sale running right now, but it's about to end.
[43:52.480 --> 43:54.400]  It's the iodine challenge.
[43:54.400 --> 43:59.760]  Both types of iodine with selenium for 60% off together.
[43:59.760 --> 44:01.920]  All of our bodies are different.
[44:01.920 --> 44:04.800]  All of our metabolic systems are diverse.
[44:04.800 --> 44:07.800]  Some of us are deficient in some things and not in others.
[44:07.800 --> 44:11.240]  There's a lot of factors that go into this and I'm not telling you something that you
[44:11.240 --> 44:14.600]  don't know, but I'm here to tell you.
[44:14.600 --> 44:22.240]  Every time I commit and use the supplements that we sell on a religious basis, my life
[44:22.240 --> 44:23.560]  completely changes.
[44:23.560 --> 44:24.560]  I'm healthier.
[44:24.560 --> 44:25.560]  I have more energy.
[44:25.560 --> 44:26.560]  I lose weight.
[44:26.560 --> 44:27.560]  I look better.
[44:27.560 --> 44:28.560]  Everybody notices.
[44:28.560 --> 44:36.040]  Two months ago, I said on air, I am going to commit to take X2 bodies, ultimate turmeric.
[44:36.040 --> 44:41.800]  I'm going to commit to flush my gut out with the gut fusion from M4's life and when I take
[44:41.800 --> 44:46.080]  these products, the results are nothing less than miraculous.
[44:46.080 --> 44:52.080]  Well, one product that's amazing that I use, I don't talk enough about is gut fusion, folks.
[44:52.080 --> 44:53.080]  Check it out.
[44:53.080 --> 44:54.080]  There's nothing else like it.
[44:54.080 --> 44:55.480]  50% off right now.
[44:55.480 --> 45:00.560]  The sale's about to end, gutfusioninfowarstore.com.
[45:00.560 --> 45:02.600]  The Alex Jones Show.
[45:02.600 --> 45:08.000]  A few days ago, my 11-year-old daughter came to me and she had her digital textbook.
[45:08.000 --> 45:12.720]  She said, Dad, they're teaching us about the periodic table and I clicked on iodine and
[45:12.720 --> 45:17.760]  it says that 2 billion people have low IQs or mentally retarded on the planet Earth because
[45:17.760 --> 45:19.000]  they didn't get enough iodine.
[45:19.000 --> 45:22.680]  That's what you say all the time, but I've heard people say you're crazy and it's not
[45:22.680 --> 45:27.360]  true, but Dad, it's right here on the periodic table when I click it saying exactly what
[45:27.360 --> 45:28.360]  you said.
[45:28.360 --> 45:33.000]  I said, I know, honey, that's why I have you take the high-quality, nutraceutical grade
[45:33.000 --> 45:37.840]  iodine is because it's why you're so vibrant, it's why you're so alive.
[45:37.840 --> 45:42.840]  It's one of the reasons that you're so much healthier and smarter than most of the kids
[45:42.840 --> 45:43.840]  you're age.
[45:43.840 --> 45:49.480]  And it just really blew her away to read it there for herself and to know that 2 billion
[45:49.480 --> 45:53.880]  people, ladies and gentlemen, 2 billion are mentally retarded on the face of the Earth
[45:53.880 --> 45:56.360]  right now because of iodine deficiency.
[45:56.360 --> 46:00.680]  Watch it and find out for yourself now.
[46:00.680 --> 46:04.840]  The time has come to defy the thought police.
[46:04.840 --> 46:08.360]  They are banning hundreds and hundreds of symbols every year.
[46:08.360 --> 46:13.720]  They're waging war on communication itself as the Fabian Socialists promised they would
[46:13.720 --> 46:17.840]  do more than 70 years ago from their command base in England.
[46:17.840 --> 46:21.600]  We've had Oxford come out and banned clapping.
[46:21.600 --> 46:26.320]  The ADL and others will literally bankrupt you, kick you out of college, destroy you,
[46:26.320 --> 46:28.000]  have you arrested in some areas.
[46:28.000 --> 46:34.000]  If you do the OK symbol that's the international sign language symbol for OK, they know what
[46:34.000 --> 46:35.160]  they're doing.
[46:35.160 --> 46:38.280]  These people are authoritarians and they're dangerous.
[46:38.280 --> 46:42.520]  And the answer to their attack on speech is to exercise it in their face.
[46:42.520 --> 46:47.680]  We have a, it's OK to be OK politically incorrect ball cap, it's black and white, very nice
[46:47.680 --> 46:52.280]  as the OK symbol on it, it's a great way to start conversations, infowars.com is on the
[46:52.280 --> 46:53.280]  back.
[46:53.280 --> 46:57.760]  We're here today at infowarsstore.com and support free speech by supporting infowars
[46:57.760 --> 47:04.080]  while having a great hat.
[47:04.080 --> 47:21.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:21.680 --> 47:29.040]  It's only 361 days to the 2020 election.
[47:29.040 --> 47:36.520]  Not only is that number, the year 2020, fabled in science fiction lore, there is a global
[47:36.520 --> 47:42.520]  rebellion against the technocrats happening, a fight between the nation states and the
[47:42.520 --> 47:47.760]  post human exterminist of the New World Order.
[47:47.760 --> 47:54.200]  History is happening now and truth is far more powerful than fiction.
[47:54.200 --> 47:57.760]  Robert Barnes is riding shotgun with me, they'll do this another hour and I intend
[47:57.760 --> 48:01.000]  at the middle of the next hour to open the phones up because he would chance to respond.
[48:01.000 --> 48:04.240]  The overwhelming news is incredible.
[48:04.240 --> 48:08.040]  Trump betrayed, like we told you he would be by John Bolton.
[48:08.040 --> 48:11.880]  He will testify against Trump even though Trump has a separation of powers and can block
[48:11.880 --> 48:13.400]  him from doing it.
[48:13.400 --> 48:20.160]  Bolton says he's going to expose the president and now they're saying they're going to impeach
[48:20.160 --> 48:25.400]  Pence as well and have begun the investigation of that in the house.
[48:25.400 --> 48:28.960]  As we told you, they're going to go after them all, put Pelosi in, she will then appoint
[48:28.960 --> 48:35.440]  Hillary who will then run as the vice president in the last months of the campaign.
[48:35.440 --> 48:40.800]  That will all be unfolding within six months, Hillary will be vice president, maybe even
[48:40.800 --> 48:45.840]  sooner, running as vice president into the presidency.
[48:45.840 --> 48:49.000]  She's on every TV show, she's campaigning, she's raising money.
[48:49.000 --> 48:52.280]  This is the plan you heard it here over two years ago with precision.
[48:52.280 --> 48:57.480]  We'll talk about Robert Barnes and your calls next hour, we'll get into the unbelievable
[48:57.480 --> 49:00.800]  Epstein developments as the whole house of cards comes down, you're like, wait, they're
[49:00.800 --> 49:06.080]  taking Trump out because they have to, they're cornered, so Trump is in trouble as they are
[49:06.080 --> 49:07.080]  free falling.
[49:07.080 --> 49:11.920]  I was like, Helter Skelter, I'm coming down fast but a mile's above you and that's what's
[49:11.920 --> 49:13.240]  key here.
[49:13.240 --> 49:20.920]  This is epic and then we've got the lawyer for the fake whistleblower who is a connoisseur
[49:20.920 --> 49:26.840]  of young girls on Disney and going to Disney World by himself and hanging out with Podesta
[49:26.840 --> 49:28.960]  and that ties in everything else.
[49:28.960 --> 49:32.880]  So we're going to be getting into, she's going to have a coup against the president
[49:32.880 --> 49:35.800]  and then now he's running the whistleblower who's putting out the disinfo.
[49:35.800 --> 49:40.300]  Yes, we're going to show that guys, let's show the tweets in Paul Watson's article.
[49:40.300 --> 49:41.300]  That's really what's key.
[49:41.300 --> 49:44.560]  It's his tweets of him at Disney World and what he says and him at the water parks and
[49:44.560 --> 49:45.560]  all the rest of it.
[49:45.560 --> 49:47.560]  We'll do it next hour.
[49:47.560 --> 49:49.520]  We're going to lay it out next hour.
[49:49.520 --> 49:57.240]  So Purdy Paul Joseph Watson has the big article all about it whistleblower attorneys YouTube
[49:57.240 --> 50:03.080]  channel includes like videos of Disney girls and then it just gets 10 times crazier.
[50:03.080 --> 50:06.040]  That's the article that has the tweets in it right there for him.
[50:06.040 --> 50:07.040]  We're going to do it next hour.
[50:07.040 --> 50:09.040]  Yeah, scroll down and show all of this.
[50:09.040 --> 50:14.560]  He says I would have joined the FBI just for the free hashtag Disney Passes says, hey,
[50:14.560 --> 50:19.520]  I love to go alone to Disney World with images of kids in the background while he creeps
[50:19.520 --> 50:20.520]  around.
[50:20.520 --> 50:26.920]  Oh, that's nothing going on there and how much he loves John Podesta John Podesta's parties.
[50:26.920 --> 50:29.560]  Tony Podesta has his Deviant Art in his dungeon.
[50:29.560 --> 50:34.440]  He showed the Washington Post 2007 part of this is wanting it with the photos and paintings
[50:34.440 --> 50:40.640]  of tied up toddlers beating black and blue.
[50:40.640 --> 50:49.240]  But hey, don't talk about it, folks, because you know, you know what happened to Epstein.
[50:49.240 --> 50:53.240]  I'm sure this guy just likes Podesta and likes to have Disney roll along with photos of children
[50:53.240 --> 50:54.240]  in the background.
[50:54.240 --> 50:57.800]  It's just like Ryan Stelter likes to smile like a crocodile.
[50:57.800 --> 51:00.080]  What big eyes and teeth you have.
[51:00.080 --> 51:07.720]  But let's go down to Jacob Ingalls, ladies and gentlemen of the South Florida Post joining
[51:07.720 --> 51:13.320]  us and he has been through the ringer and I think it's just best if he tells you in
[51:13.320 --> 51:18.840]  his own words what happened and what transpired yesterday and we've got a lawyer right here
[51:18.840 --> 51:22.360]  who pointed out the Supreme Court rule that you can put out who jurors are you're supposed
[51:22.360 --> 51:28.520]  to, especially when they're public figures, hell, what if Hillary was on the jury?
[51:28.520 --> 51:30.200]  This is pretty much what happened.
[51:30.200 --> 51:33.520]  So Jacob Ingalls, thank you for joining us, sir.
[51:33.520 --> 51:34.840]  Absolutely great to be with you, Alex.
[51:34.840 --> 51:39.000]  Well, tell us what happened yesterday and why suddenly I couldn't even get Roger Stone's
[51:39.000 --> 51:40.360]  lawyers that were scheduled to come on.
[51:40.360 --> 51:41.360]  They were so scared.
[51:41.360 --> 51:47.440]  Well, yesterday I woke up through a barrage of fake news and with being censored and cut
[51:47.440 --> 51:51.480]  off on Twitter and Facebook, I literally have no way to respond to it.
[51:51.480 --> 51:55.200]  So I'm really grateful to be on the program today, but we were discussing and having a
[51:55.200 --> 52:00.320]  basic discussion about the jury pool and publicly available information that was out on Twitter
[52:00.320 --> 52:06.800]  all over the place about this Obama era communications asset working in the office of management
[52:06.800 --> 52:09.720]  and budget who was being selected as a juror.
[52:09.720 --> 52:11.000]  We exposed that.
[52:11.000 --> 52:16.720]  We brought that to the forefront and then fake news, media matters, right, we've watched
[52:16.720 --> 52:20.560]  and others said that I'm trying to intimidate the jury, that you're trying to intimidate
[52:20.560 --> 52:21.560]  the jury.
[52:21.560 --> 52:22.560]  That simply is not true.
[52:22.560 --> 52:26.240]  We were simply sharing information that's publicly available.
[52:26.240 --> 52:30.840]  Quite frankly, we should be able to read all of the jury members' jury selection process
[52:30.840 --> 52:31.840]  questionnaires.
[52:31.840 --> 52:33.240]  We need to know what these people think.
[52:33.240 --> 52:34.760]  Hell, we need to know their names.
[52:34.760 --> 52:39.680]  It's not fair in America to have a closed trial like this.
[52:39.680 --> 52:42.640]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[52:42.640 --> 52:45.160]  Getting into as many annexes as you can, I talked to others in the courtroom.
[52:45.160 --> 52:49.600]  They said she kicked the media out, cut the video feeds off to the media room.
[52:49.600 --> 52:54.440]  Robert Barnes read that in the news, but they wouldn't say what happened and reportedly
[52:54.440 --> 52:58.440]  she said that you've done something wrong or was threatening to hold you in contempt.
[52:58.440 --> 52:59.440]  What really happened?
[52:59.440 --> 53:07.200]  Well, I heard in some of the reports from yesterday morning that certain individuals
[53:07.200 --> 53:13.720]  were trying to pollute the process and trying to intimidate the jury pool, i.e., being you
[53:13.720 --> 53:20.200]  and others talking about the deep democratic ties and deep state ties of these jurors.
[53:20.200 --> 53:24.920]  And then today she announces there's no media viewing room.
[53:24.920 --> 53:26.000]  There's no more tweeting.
[53:26.000 --> 53:27.320]  She kicks people out.
[53:27.320 --> 53:28.320]  This is America.
[53:28.320 --> 53:29.760]  This isn't Soviet-era Russia.
[53:29.760 --> 53:31.760]  This isn't a banana republic.
[53:31.760 --> 53:33.640]  This isn't a third-world dictatorship.
[53:33.640 --> 53:35.320]  This is the United States of America.
[53:35.320 --> 53:38.080]  This trial should be televised quite frankly.
[53:38.080 --> 53:43.360]  But we'll pull up the name in the background, but remember how running the prosecution
[53:43.360 --> 53:48.080]  in the background was Hillary's head lawyer from her foundation.
[53:48.080 --> 53:53.640]  So they're not really trying to hide any of this and the judge, I guess, is angry that
[53:53.640 --> 53:59.360]  we read the Politico and the Reuters quotes that all have the same quotes of her saying
[53:59.360 --> 54:00.360]  this is no big deal.
[54:00.360 --> 54:02.000]  I mean, I mean, Barnes, this is crazy.
[54:02.000 --> 54:03.000]  Oh, yeah.
[54:03.000 --> 54:07.280]  I mean, the judge's behavior has been highly flagrantly unconstitutional and a slap in
[54:07.280 --> 54:09.800]  the face to the First Amendment across the board.
[54:09.800 --> 54:12.720]  And the courts are engaging in highly politicized conduct.
[54:12.720 --> 54:14.680]  That's what led to the public commentary.
[54:14.680 --> 54:16.320]  This is just inappropriate.
[54:16.320 --> 54:21.640]  These are bad rulings by a court that appears to be overreacting to press and public coverage
[54:21.640 --> 54:25.320]  and public opinion that is the First Amendment rights of the members of the press and the
[54:25.320 --> 54:26.920]  public to do.
[54:26.920 --> 54:32.560]  We absolutely need public scrutiny of high-profile political cases like this in order to ensure
[54:32.560 --> 54:37.040]  their integrity, in order to ensure their fairness, in order to ensure their impartiality.
[54:37.040 --> 54:41.760]  Let's take Jeannie Rae, the head lawyer of her foundation that's stones exposing, heading
[54:41.760 --> 54:44.680]  up the prosecution, and the judge says that's fine.
[54:44.680 --> 54:45.680]  I mean, my God.
[54:45.680 --> 54:48.040]  So it's like having Obama and Hillary on the jury.
[54:48.040 --> 54:51.240]  Hell, why not have Hillary just be the judge?
[54:51.240 --> 54:57.480]  It feels like a political railroad because the court's behavior enhances that impression
[54:57.480 --> 55:02.160]  when she does things like bar people from the courtroom, lock people out of the courtroom.
[55:02.160 --> 55:05.200]  Don't tell them what's happening in the jury transcript records.
[55:05.200 --> 55:08.480]  Don't tell them about the records and background of the jurors.
[55:08.480 --> 55:11.800]  There's been public criticism over whether or not we were able to, InfoWars is able to
[55:11.800 --> 55:14.120]  accurately identify the prospective juror.
[55:14.120 --> 55:17.960]  That's only an issue because the judge is not allowing information apparently to go public
[55:17.960 --> 55:19.320]  so everybody can know what it is.
[55:19.320 --> 55:20.320]  This should all be public.
[55:20.320 --> 55:25.200]  In my view, as federal courtrooms should allow for videos to be in the courtroom, unfortunately
[55:25.200 --> 55:26.200]  they don't.
[55:26.200 --> 55:30.720]  I think it would enhance public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary
[55:30.720 --> 55:32.560]  if they could see what's happening.
[55:32.560 --> 55:36.760]  So she, I mean, she kicked everybody out yesterday, reportedly, so they could quote, finish up
[55:36.760 --> 55:37.760]  the juries.
[55:37.760 --> 55:38.760]  Well, there are just as big a problems.
[55:38.760 --> 55:43.920]  In fact, what are your sources saying about the rest of this jury, Mr. Engels?
[55:43.920 --> 55:52.560]  Well, we've heard that there were two prospective jurors out of nearly 100 that had some tie
[55:52.560 --> 55:57.200]  to a Republican administration or might have worked on a Republican campaign in the past
[55:57.200 --> 56:02.920]  20, 30, 40 years, and those were immediately removed from the jury pool.
[56:02.920 --> 56:07.720]  The prosecution argue that they would be biased, the judge accepts that argument, while in
[56:07.720 --> 56:13.080]  the same day, out of the same judge's mouth, out of the prosecutor's mouth, they're making
[56:13.080 --> 56:17.720]  arguments that somebody servicing the Obama administration or a Democrat campaign was
[56:17.720 --> 56:21.720]  not reason enough to show bias and remove them from the jury.
[56:21.720 --> 56:26.200]  So now as it stands from what I've read and what I've reviewed, it looks like Roger Stone
[56:26.200 --> 56:29.320]  is facing an all Democrat jury in DC.
[56:29.320 --> 56:34.200]  I don't know how that's a jury of his peers.
[56:34.200 --> 56:35.200]  You've got a lot of observations.
[56:35.200 --> 56:36.200]  I've got a lot of questions.
[56:36.200 --> 56:40.440]  I want to hold you over, Jacob, but give people your exact URL because as you said, you're
[56:40.440 --> 56:44.200]  being blocked banned everywhere because you dare be a real reporter there.
[56:44.200 --> 56:49.440]  You're also telling me how they let the anti Stone demonstrators there, but then bar you
[56:49.440 --> 56:50.440]  guys.
[56:50.440 --> 56:52.720]  So we're going to come back, start telling us about that.
[56:52.720 --> 56:54.600]  And what else do you want to tell people about?
[56:54.600 --> 56:55.600]  Absolutely.
[56:55.600 --> 56:59.200]  People can follow my work at centralportifost.com and what you just mentioned there.
[56:59.200 --> 57:04.320]  They allow anti Stone demonstrators to hook up to the courthouse power for their demonstrations
[57:04.320 --> 57:05.640]  and to be on courthouse property.
[57:05.640 --> 57:10.800]  Alex, if I even looked at the sidewalk that attaches to the courthouse entrance, I wouldn't
[57:10.800 --> 57:11.800]  be jailed.
[57:11.800 --> 57:13.320]  That is how silly this is.
[57:13.320 --> 57:15.720]  And again, I'm teleprompter free.
[57:15.720 --> 57:16.720]  So I make mistakes.
[57:16.720 --> 57:18.160]  They're usually stupid ones.
[57:18.160 --> 57:19.160]  South Florida Post.
[57:19.160 --> 57:24.200]  It's centralfloridipost.com centralfloridipost.com centralfloridipost.com centralfloridipost.com
[57:24.200 --> 57:25.200]  centralfloridipost.com.
[57:25.200 --> 57:30.080]  This poor guy is so nice, he won't correct me when I'm making ridiculous errors, but
[57:30.080 --> 57:33.040]  you've got a guarantee for me when I make them.
[57:33.040 --> 57:34.040]  Tell me about it all.
[57:34.040 --> 57:35.040]  Fix them.
[57:35.040 --> 57:36.040]  And they're old.
[57:36.040 --> 57:37.040]  They're always something stupid like that.
[57:37.040 --> 57:39.920]  But I make a lot of them centralfloridipost.com.
[57:39.920 --> 57:40.920]  Go there.
[57:40.920 --> 57:41.920]  This guy is under attack.
[57:41.920 --> 57:43.920]  He needs a spot where he can tell you what really happened.
[57:43.920 --> 57:49.720]  We'll be right back with the head of centralfloridipost.com.
[57:49.720 --> 57:53.880]  The time has come to defy the thought police.
[57:53.880 --> 57:57.400]  They are banning hundreds and hundreds of symbols every year.
[57:57.400 --> 58:02.760]  They're waging war on communication itself, as the Fabian socialists promised they would
[58:02.760 --> 58:06.800]  do more than 70 years ago from their command base in England.
[58:06.800 --> 58:10.640]  We've had Oxford come out and banned clapping.
[58:10.640 --> 58:15.400]  The ADL and others will literally bankrupt you, kick you out of college, destroy you,
[58:15.400 --> 58:17.080]  have you arrested in some areas?
[58:17.080 --> 58:23.080]  If you do the OK symbol, that's the international sign language symbol for OK, they know what
[58:23.080 --> 58:24.200]  they're doing.
[58:24.200 --> 58:27.360]  These people are authoritarians and they're dangerous.
[58:27.360 --> 58:31.600]  And the answer to their attack on speech is to exercise it in their face.
[58:31.600 --> 58:35.480]  We have a it's OK to be OK politically incorrect ball cap.
[58:35.480 --> 58:36.480]  It's black and white.
[58:36.480 --> 58:37.480]  Very nice.
[58:37.480 --> 58:38.480]  There's the OK symbol on it.
[58:38.480 --> 58:40.520]  It's a great way to start conversations.

[59:13.240 --> 59:17.440]  taxes on this is 147 is the cost with free shipping.
[59:17.440 --> 59:18.680]  They've never done a deal that good.
[59:18.680 --> 59:19.680]  It's a hot item.
[59:19.680 --> 59:21.880]  They sell tens of thousands of these a year.
[59:21.880 --> 59:24.280]  It's a four stage ion cluster.
[59:24.280 --> 59:26.520]  Other competing brands are four hundred, five hundred, six hundred, seven hundred
[59:26.520 --> 59:27.520]  dollars.
[59:27.520 --> 59:28.520]  All the markup.
[59:28.520 --> 59:32.000]  No, ladies and gentlemen, we usually sell these all day long for two fifty.
[59:32.000 --> 59:33.720]  They're a great deal.
[59:33.720 --> 59:34.720]  One forty seven.
[59:34.720 --> 59:39.240]  I almost told the guy like this cuts into the market so just low people don't appreciate
[59:39.240 --> 59:40.240]  it.
[59:40.240 --> 59:42.560]  Well, this is what the infowars audience gets infowarstore.com.
[59:42.560 --> 59:47.880]  There's only a few hundred of these left at this price and then more don't come in until
[59:47.880 --> 59:53.480]  next year.
[59:53.480 --> 1:00:10.640]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[1:00:10.640 --> 1:00:19.320]  It's Alex Jones talk about the danger zone, Jacob Ingalls, who heads up the central Florida
[1:00:19.320 --> 1:00:20.320]  Post.
[1:00:20.320 --> 1:00:21.320]  Great publication.
[1:00:21.320 --> 1:00:24.160]  A lot of big stories.
[1:00:24.160 --> 1:00:25.880]  Is there covering any friends with Roger Stone?
[1:00:25.880 --> 1:00:26.880]  He's been here.
[1:00:26.880 --> 1:00:27.880]  He does a great job.
[1:00:27.880 --> 1:00:32.640]  He helped us both CNN and their fake, you know, information claiming they didn't have prior
[1:00:32.640 --> 1:00:37.920]  knowledge about the raid and then get the video of them being directed by the FBI.
[1:00:37.920 --> 1:00:41.120]  He had Mueller testifying, there was nothing about any of it, it's incredible.
[1:00:41.120 --> 1:00:48.960]  He's there and the judge reportedly flipped out in court yesterday saying that I and others
[1:00:48.960 --> 1:00:51.760]  were trying to mess up the jury selection.
[1:00:51.760 --> 1:00:55.600]  Well, I mean, we're hearing that you're getting a head of the department from Obama whose
[1:00:55.600 --> 1:00:57.960]  husband worked on the Mueller investigation.
[1:00:57.960 --> 1:01:01.600]  That's total recusal of a judge if the judge's husband worked on the Mueller investigation.
[1:01:01.600 --> 1:01:03.760]  Total recusal striking of a juror.
[1:01:03.760 --> 1:01:06.240]  I mean, is that not the case Robert Barnes as a constitutional lawyer?
[1:01:06.240 --> 1:01:08.960]  So what you have is you have the right to strike jurors for cause, you have a right
[1:01:08.960 --> 1:01:11.120]  to an impartial jury.
[1:01:11.120 --> 1:01:14.720]  The jury of your peers language actually comes from the Magna Carter more than 800 years
[1:01:14.720 --> 1:01:18.400]  ago where what was happening is Knights were being judged by people who had never walked
[1:01:18.400 --> 1:01:19.400]  in the shoes of a Knight.
[1:01:19.400 --> 1:01:22.680]  And the Knights were like, these people can't effectively judge us because they don't understand
[1:01:22.680 --> 1:01:23.680]  the context, the circumstances.
[1:01:23.680 --> 1:01:25.880]  So if you were a Miller, they'd get other millers.
[1:01:25.880 --> 1:01:26.880]  Exactly.
[1:01:26.880 --> 1:01:29.000]  If you were a same-stress, they'd get same-stresses.
[1:01:29.000 --> 1:01:30.440]  And the tradition had always been a while.
[1:01:30.440 --> 1:01:33.080]  Well, the King later got tried, they'd have other royals either.
[1:01:33.080 --> 1:01:34.080]  Right.
[1:01:34.080 --> 1:01:38.040]  So the 5th and 6th Amendments have been interpreted to mean you don't have a right to a jury
[1:01:38.040 --> 1:01:41.440]  of your peers, but you have a right to an impartial jury.
[1:01:41.440 --> 1:01:44.440]  That it reflects a cross-section of the community.
[1:01:44.440 --> 1:01:48.000]  And that means politically, ideologically, culturally, demographically, et cetera.
[1:01:48.000 --> 1:01:53.640]  Now, they have mostly only enforced it on issues of gender and race and nationality.
[1:01:53.640 --> 1:01:58.040]  They have not enforced it consistently as to ideologically diverse perspectives.
[1:01:58.040 --> 1:02:01.880]  So the issue in D.C. was always, I would have moved to transfer it for venue purposes.
[1:02:01.880 --> 1:02:07.520]  D.C. has become, the D.C. jury pool has become like the Alabama juries of the 1950s who were
[1:02:07.520 --> 1:02:11.960]  nullifying verdicts or issuing false verdicts like to kill a mockingbird type verdict.
[1:02:11.960 --> 1:02:13.280]  The left is not for scalps.
[1:02:13.280 --> 1:02:14.280]  Correct.
[1:02:14.280 --> 1:02:15.760]  But they've been nullifying Antifa cases.
[1:02:15.760 --> 1:02:20.160]  They have not been able to get secure convictions consistently on Antifa cases in D.C.
[1:02:20.160 --> 1:02:23.960]  So given that environment, it was highly unlikely Stone was ever going to get a fair trial in
[1:02:23.960 --> 1:02:25.360]  D.C. That was problem number one.
[1:02:25.360 --> 1:02:28.640]  Problem number two was Stone has been stripped of his ability to defend himself in the court
[1:02:28.640 --> 1:02:29.800]  of public opinion.
[1:02:29.800 --> 1:02:33.200]  Which means all of the negative stuff about him has come out, but very little positive
[1:02:33.200 --> 1:02:34.200]  has come out.
[1:02:34.200 --> 1:02:36.720]  So this is a classic railroading.
[1:02:36.720 --> 1:02:40.880]  You have a contaminated jury pool that is already predisposed against him.
[1:02:40.880 --> 1:02:43.280]  He's been stripped of his ability to defend himself.
[1:02:43.280 --> 1:02:46.840]  So your only remedy left is to have meaningful jury selection.
[1:02:46.840 --> 1:02:48.880]  And that involves a three-fold process.
[1:02:48.880 --> 1:02:52.280]  One to have a broadly expansive number of people in there.
[1:02:52.280 --> 1:02:55.520]  Every jury survey that's ever been done by political scientists at arrest for the most
[1:02:55.520 --> 1:02:59.640]  part will show consistently that jurors have hidden biases that they themselves don't even
[1:02:59.640 --> 1:03:02.000]  recognize in themselves.
[1:03:02.000 --> 1:03:06.200]  And that you need hundreds of prospective jurors to get to twelve jurors who can truly
[1:03:06.200 --> 1:03:07.200]  be impartial.
[1:03:07.200 --> 1:03:11.600]  Who have not been contaminated by anti-Stone news he has not been able to defend himself
[1:03:11.600 --> 1:03:12.600]  against.
[1:03:12.600 --> 1:03:15.840]  The second part is you should have meaningful voidier.
[1:03:15.840 --> 1:03:18.880]  So one you should have a big panel, two you should have meaning what they call voidiers
[1:03:18.880 --> 1:03:20.080]  to speak the truth.
[1:03:20.080 --> 1:03:24.000]  That's what the jury selection process is called in the federal court system.
[1:03:24.000 --> 1:03:27.800]  There should be meaningful questioning of the jurors so you can figure out where they
[1:03:27.800 --> 1:03:29.200]  may be biased.
[1:03:29.200 --> 1:03:30.920]  Here everybody knows.
[1:03:30.920 --> 1:03:31.920]  There's nobody who...
[1:03:31.920 --> 1:03:36.320]  And the judge says, oh you hate Trump, you hate Stone, well can you be impartial?
[1:03:36.320 --> 1:03:37.560]  Oh yes I can.
[1:03:37.560 --> 1:03:38.560]  Unfortunately...
[1:03:38.560 --> 1:03:41.360]  It's like asking your cat, we're going to put you in a cage with five canaries.
[1:03:41.360 --> 1:03:42.760]  Can you be impartial and I'll eat them?
[1:03:42.760 --> 1:03:43.760]  Of course I can.
[1:03:43.760 --> 1:03:46.080]  Because they pull a feather out of the mouth.
[1:03:46.080 --> 1:03:50.720]  It's an unfortunately common proclivity of federal courts to employ that mechanism.
[1:03:50.720 --> 1:03:54.480]  And my view has always been that that makes a joke out of jury selection.
[1:03:54.480 --> 1:04:00.040]  That nobody is going to be able to self-reflect on their own bias, the very nature of bias
[1:04:00.040 --> 1:04:01.040]  is that they don't know that they have it.
[1:04:01.040 --> 1:04:04.760]  We're going to come back every one minute and get his take on this and have you expand
[1:04:04.760 --> 1:04:05.760]  on it.
[1:04:05.760 --> 1:04:10.320]  But the fact that this judge doesn't care and she thinks a railroading of Stone will
[1:04:10.320 --> 1:04:11.520]  legitimize Mueller.
[1:04:11.520 --> 1:04:13.120]  I don't see this dog hunting.
[1:04:13.120 --> 1:04:16.800]  I think more and more they're disconnected and their raw exercise of power is going to
[1:04:16.800 --> 1:04:17.800]  trigger a bigger rebellion.
[1:04:17.800 --> 1:04:19.560]  Well it's like the Chicago 7 trial.
[1:04:19.560 --> 1:04:23.480]  This is the most analogous Roger Stone's case is to the Chicago 7 trial even though he hasn't
[1:04:23.480 --> 1:04:25.800]  used any of the tactics that they employ there.
[1:04:25.800 --> 1:04:28.600]  He hasn't tried to be disruptive or anything of that nature.
[1:04:28.600 --> 1:04:29.600]  But it's akin to that.
[1:04:29.600 --> 1:04:33.640]  And what happened is it exposed the corruption within the way our judicial system handled
[1:04:33.640 --> 1:04:35.400]  some of these politicized cases.
[1:04:35.400 --> 1:04:37.000]  And we need to fix it and fix it permanently.
[1:04:37.000 --> 1:04:38.000]  That's right.
[1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:41.920]  I mean they got this Politico attack dog judge and their Obama put in there to be the hanging
[1:04:41.920 --> 1:04:42.920]  judge.
[1:04:42.920 --> 1:04:44.400]  They put her in DC where they control things.
[1:04:44.400 --> 1:04:49.160]  She's their political weapon and she's just totally exposing them.
[1:04:49.160 --> 1:04:51.760]  She's just absolutely a joke.
[1:04:51.760 --> 1:04:54.120]  What a little petty dictator.
[1:04:54.120 --> 1:04:55.120]  This woman is incredible.
[1:04:55.120 --> 1:04:58.880]  We'll be right back.
[1:04:58.880 --> 1:05:01.040]  All of our bodies are different.
[1:05:01.040 --> 1:05:03.920]  All of our metabolic systems are diverse.
[1:05:03.920 --> 1:05:06.920]  Some of us are deficient in some things and not in others.
[1:05:06.920 --> 1:05:10.360]  There's a lot of factors that go into this and I'm not telling you something that you
[1:05:10.360 --> 1:05:11.360]  don't know.
[1:05:11.360 --> 1:05:18.920]  But I'm here to tell you every time I commit and use the supplements that we sell on a
[1:05:18.920 --> 1:05:22.680]  religious basis, my life completely changes.
[1:05:22.680 --> 1:05:23.680]  I'm healthier.
[1:05:23.680 --> 1:05:24.680]  I have more energy.
[1:05:24.680 --> 1:05:25.680]  I lose weight.
[1:05:25.680 --> 1:05:26.680]  I look better.
[1:05:26.680 --> 1:05:27.680]  Everybody notices.
[1:05:27.680 --> 1:05:35.160]  Two months ago, I said on air, I am going to commit to take X2 bodies ultimate turmeric.
[1:05:35.160 --> 1:05:40.360]  I'm going to commit to flush my gut out with the gut fusion from M4's life.
[1:05:40.360 --> 1:05:45.240]  And when I take these products, the results are nothing less than miraculous.
[1:05:45.240 --> 1:05:47.240]  Well, one product that's amazing that I use.
[1:05:47.240 --> 1:05:51.240]  What I don't talk enough about is gut fusion, folks.
[1:05:51.240 --> 1:05:52.240]  Check it out.
[1:05:52.240 --> 1:05:53.240]  There's nothing else like it.
[1:05:53.240 --> 1:05:54.640]  50% off right now.
[1:05:54.640 --> 1:05:56.320]  The sale's about to end.
[1:05:56.320 --> 1:06:05.680]  Gutfusion, infoorstore.com.
[1:06:05.680 --> 1:06:09.160]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[1:06:09.160 --> 1:06:27.600]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info or ladies and gentlemen,
[1:06:27.600 --> 1:06:36.200]  it's only 361 days until the 2020 election coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[1:06:36.200 --> 1:06:42.720]  The betrayer John Bolton, the first to plunge his knife openly into Caesar's heart, did
[1:06:42.720 --> 1:06:45.720]  the knife find its target?
[1:06:45.720 --> 1:06:50.560]  He wants to violate executive privilege, separation of powers and testify to the president and
[1:06:50.560 --> 1:06:55.360]  they're announcing the impeachment of the vice president has now been launched in the
[1:06:55.360 --> 1:06:58.640]  kangaroo operation of Mr. Schiff.
[1:06:58.640 --> 1:07:04.160]  But huge Epstein developments, endangering with each state in Hillary, the biggest jet.
[1:07:04.160 --> 1:07:09.080]  They're going to get to that as well and the so-called whistleblower, his lawyer, pledged
[1:07:09.080 --> 1:07:11.720]  to coothe the president and to take him down.
[1:07:11.720 --> 1:07:16.600]  He works with John Podesta when he's not at Disney World by himself or posting photos
[1:07:16.600 --> 1:07:19.560]  of himself, the small children in the background.
[1:07:19.560 --> 1:07:21.000]  You can't make this up.
[1:07:21.000 --> 1:07:22.000]  It's all coming up.
[1:07:22.000 --> 1:07:28.600]  We're going to talk to Central Florida Post reporter who has been covering the situation
[1:07:28.600 --> 1:07:31.000]  and the insanity of the leftist.
[1:07:31.000 --> 1:07:34.760]  The leftist allowed to demonstrate at the courthouse conservatives aren't the judge
[1:07:34.760 --> 1:07:40.560]  trying to shut everybody up, trying to put Obama officials on the panel, recap it and
[1:07:40.560 --> 1:07:43.760]  get into other information.
[1:07:43.760 --> 1:07:44.760]  Absolutely, Alex.
[1:07:44.760 --> 1:07:47.640]  We've been out here ever since the trial started.
[1:07:47.640 --> 1:07:51.120]  One of the interesting aspects of this is the judge made it very clear she didn't want
[1:07:51.120 --> 1:07:52.120]  this to be a circus.
[1:07:52.120 --> 1:07:55.840]  She didn't want this to be a political demonstration.
[1:07:55.840 --> 1:08:02.720]  However, those rules only seem to apply to conservatives, pro-Trump, pro-Stone individuals.
[1:08:02.720 --> 1:08:08.760]  Yesterday, Roger was eating lunch and in the lunch area there's this little gallery window
[1:08:08.760 --> 1:08:14.080]  where you can see out into the Capitol area and they were allowing a man with an inflatable
[1:08:14.080 --> 1:08:20.480]  Trump wrath, a known rabid leftist who has mental problems to push this inflatable up
[1:08:20.480 --> 1:08:24.200]  against the window and harass Stone and other people trying to eat lunch.
[1:08:24.200 --> 1:08:29.040]  Furthermore, they have allowed this individual on court property to hook up into the court
[1:08:29.040 --> 1:08:33.160]  power system to inflate his wrath and harass Stone as he walks in.
[1:08:33.160 --> 1:08:37.920]  They even let the guy on the first day stay in a bush and hop out of it with a sign that
[1:08:37.920 --> 1:08:39.520]  said traitor on it.
[1:08:39.520 --> 1:08:45.440]  This is unbelievable if any of our people even stepped on the courthouse sidewalk and
[1:08:45.440 --> 1:08:46.440]  tried to do any of that.
[1:08:46.440 --> 1:08:50.600]  We would be immediately detained by federal marshals or Capitol police.
[1:08:50.600 --> 1:08:55.200]  And we're going to show some of that inflatable rat.
[1:08:55.200 --> 1:09:00.920]  The co-founder of Right Wing Watch, Fonobah Soros, is also involved with this rat.
[1:09:00.920 --> 1:09:05.800]  We had one of the gentlemen that runs the rat grab Owen Schroyer's microphone and eat
[1:09:05.800 --> 1:09:09.640]  the filthy windscreen and those things don't smell good.
[1:09:09.640 --> 1:09:10.920]  Okay, mine doesn't smell good.
[1:09:10.920 --> 1:09:11.920]  Nobody's does.
[1:09:11.920 --> 1:09:13.000]  We throw him away all the time.
[1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:15.080]  He literally ate it and swallowed it.
[1:09:15.080 --> 1:09:16.440]  We've got that video somewhere.
[1:09:16.440 --> 1:09:17.440]  These people are crazed.
[1:09:17.440 --> 1:09:23.960]  They're absolutely insane and unstable, Alex, but this is the biggest problem that we face
[1:09:23.960 --> 1:09:29.320]  right now in this political climate is people who belong in asylums that we shut down decades
[1:09:29.320 --> 1:09:33.360]  ago are now out and about the streets allowed to behave like this.
[1:09:33.360 --> 1:09:38.800]  And if we do anything to defend ourselves or to counter their insanity, we're the violent
[1:09:38.800 --> 1:09:39.800]  ones.
[1:09:39.800 --> 1:09:43.920]  We're the ones that are quote unquote Nazis, fascists, and people who are destroying the
[1:09:43.920 --> 1:09:45.080]  United States of America.
[1:09:45.080 --> 1:09:47.920]  No, you're the ones destroying the United States of America.
[1:09:47.920 --> 1:09:53.160]  This kangaroo port, what's happening to Roger Stone, must be exposed and it must be stopped.
[1:09:53.160 --> 1:09:54.840]  Americans, wake up.
[1:09:54.840 --> 1:09:57.600]  This will happen to you if you don't stop it today.
[1:09:57.600 --> 1:09:58.600]  Well, that's right.
[1:09:58.600 --> 1:10:04.200]  I also forgot that people showing up with Russian flags, throwing hammer and sickle stickers
[1:10:04.200 --> 1:10:12.040]  out at Roger, but Russian, Russian, Russian, I mean, this is like a Monty Python skit.
[1:10:12.040 --> 1:10:16.280]  It's been made into a joke of a proceeding and that is in part the responsibility of
[1:10:16.280 --> 1:10:18.320]  the court to fix.
[1:10:18.320 --> 1:10:22.160]  So there's only limits that the court can and should exercise in terms of limiting First
[1:10:22.160 --> 1:10:24.680]  Amendment speech outside of the courtroom.
[1:10:24.680 --> 1:10:29.040]  But it is problematic that it appears to people that are participating in the process, that
[1:10:29.040 --> 1:10:33.040]  it is discriminatory in the way in which he's applying the rules or at least threatening
[1:10:33.040 --> 1:10:34.280]  to apply the rules.
[1:10:34.280 --> 1:10:38.240]  So and unfortunately, that's been her protocol and procedure throughout these proceedings.
[1:10:38.240 --> 1:10:41.040]  And again, I want to get people that are one dimensional thinkers.
[1:10:41.040 --> 1:10:44.600]  It isn't our main audience, but a lot of new listeners were on over 200 radio stations,
[1:10:44.600 --> 1:10:46.240]  a whole bunch of cable and TV stations.
[1:10:46.240 --> 1:10:49.800]  People are like, well, why do I care about Roger Stone or why do I care about the stock
[1:10:49.800 --> 1:10:50.800]  market crashes?
[1:10:50.800 --> 1:10:53.560]  Well, the stock market crash, we've been in depression and millions would be starving
[1:10:53.560 --> 1:10:58.160]  to death like in the last big one, but worse, even if you don't own stock, that affects companies,
[1:10:58.160 --> 1:10:59.160]  everything else.
[1:10:59.160 --> 1:11:03.360]  Well, the fact that the judicial tyranny is like this and the Democrats are trying to
[1:11:03.360 --> 1:11:07.800]  take me off the air from Austin and Connecticut and leftist jurisdictions and are admitting
[1:11:07.800 --> 1:11:11.400]  they're doing it and come up to me on the street and say you're going to prison and
[1:11:11.400 --> 1:11:16.880]  they've got articles in the Daily Beast and in a bunch of other publications today saying
[1:11:16.880 --> 1:11:20.800]  I need to be arrested for death-threading the jurors when they're the ones death-threading
[1:11:20.800 --> 1:11:22.840]  jurors in my name.
[1:11:22.840 --> 1:11:24.480]  It's beyond straw man is insane.
[1:11:24.480 --> 1:11:26.000]  So let's get into that subject.
[1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:27.800]  If you're a TV viewer, you can see this.
[1:11:27.800 --> 1:11:30.920]  That's a still shot from live video feed yesterday.
[1:11:30.920 --> 1:11:35.480]  Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself, proved me wrong, proved me wrong dot show, a new
[1:11:35.480 --> 1:11:38.000]  show we're going to start weekly that I'll do in public.
[1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:42.840]  We just set up a card table just like Stephen Crowder does.
[1:11:42.840 --> 1:11:45.000]  People go, you're stealing Stephen Crowder's deal.
[1:11:45.000 --> 1:11:46.560]  Folks were in information war.
[1:11:46.560 --> 1:11:49.960]  I was doing card tables and public debates 20 years ago.
[1:11:49.960 --> 1:11:54.360]  It's called prove me wrong, not to change my mind, but yes, we're going out and having
[1:11:54.360 --> 1:11:56.880]  public discussions.
[1:11:56.880 --> 1:12:01.560]  So we had the grim reaper out there to point out that Epstein was murdered and it's something
[1:12:01.560 --> 1:12:05.360]  to get crowds to come over and a big crowd did come over.
[1:12:05.360 --> 1:12:09.880]  And we talked about how Epstein died and all of that on the show and Rob do came in here
[1:12:09.880 --> 1:12:12.520]  dresses the grim reaper, which we plan to do.
[1:12:12.520 --> 1:12:14.320]  That was not a threat to the jury.
[1:12:14.320 --> 1:12:16.520]  We didn't talk about it in relation to the jury.
[1:12:16.520 --> 1:12:22.360]  It was in relation to Epstein and we said that, but the media lies and said, we did.
[1:12:22.360 --> 1:12:26.360]  What do you call that when they put a lie in your mouth, then call for you to be arrested?
[1:12:26.360 --> 1:12:30.160]  Because if I did say, you're something about killing jurors, if you convict stone, I should
[1:12:30.160 --> 1:12:31.200]  be arrested.
[1:12:31.200 --> 1:12:32.200]  That is terrorist.
[1:12:32.200 --> 1:12:33.200]  That is mafia.
[1:12:33.200 --> 1:12:34.200]  I don't do that.
[1:12:34.200 --> 1:12:35.480]  I've been on there 25 years.
[1:12:35.480 --> 1:12:36.880]  I don't threaten little people.
[1:12:36.880 --> 1:12:38.080]  I come after big people.
[1:12:38.080 --> 1:12:39.080]  You want to comment, Barnes?
[1:12:39.080 --> 1:12:40.080]  Yes, several other things.
[1:12:40.080 --> 1:12:43.920]  There's never been, and no one should communicate with either a judge or a jury.
[1:12:43.920 --> 1:12:49.240]  That was one of the mistakes made in the Silk Road case in New York, where some of the people
[1:12:49.240 --> 1:12:53.960]  who favored the defendant thought he was being mistreated and they communicated directly
[1:12:53.960 --> 1:12:55.000]  to the court and the jury.
[1:12:55.000 --> 1:12:56.240]  That should never happen.
[1:12:56.240 --> 1:12:58.320]  So there's no desire for that to happen.
[1:12:58.320 --> 1:13:02.560]  What there is a desire to happen is a discussion in the court of public opinion about what
[1:13:02.560 --> 1:13:07.720]  is transpiring here and whether it is consistent with constitutional liberties, a free republic
[1:13:07.720 --> 1:13:10.000]  and the integrity of our judicial process.
[1:13:10.000 --> 1:13:13.640]  And that is the job of everyone to discuss and everyone to debate.
[1:13:13.640 --> 1:13:17.040]  There's no desire whatsoever to go at jurors or judges.
[1:13:17.040 --> 1:13:19.720]  There's nobody that's blaming jurors for them being picked.
[1:13:19.720 --> 1:13:20.720]  That's not their role.
[1:13:20.720 --> 1:13:21.720]  They didn't pick themselves.
[1:13:21.720 --> 1:13:22.720]  But it's just crazy.
[1:13:22.720 --> 1:13:26.360]  Never would I even think like that, and it's just they constantly do it.
[1:13:26.360 --> 1:13:27.360]  Well, what it tells you is...
[1:13:27.360 --> 1:13:32.840]  The judge is trying to appoint Obama officials whose husband is on the Mueller investigation.
[1:13:32.840 --> 1:13:34.440]  Why not put Mueller as the damn judge?
[1:13:34.440 --> 1:13:35.440]  Well, watch what I mean.
[1:13:35.440 --> 1:13:36.440]  I mean, this is a sick joke.
[1:13:36.440 --> 1:13:37.680]  We're supposed to expose that.
[1:13:37.680 --> 1:13:39.680]  It's still America.
[1:13:39.680 --> 1:13:41.520]  Not trying to threaten the damn jurors.
[1:13:41.520 --> 1:13:45.480]  And the damn thing, the grim reaper was about Epstein.
[1:13:45.480 --> 1:13:50.240]  What it does suggest to me is that people should be on high alert if McCabe or Comey
[1:13:50.240 --> 1:13:52.200]  or anyone else goes to trial.
[1:13:52.200 --> 1:13:56.480]  Because it tells me that media on the left will try to intimidate jurors.
[1:13:56.480 --> 1:13:58.720]  And media on the left will try to do it.
[1:13:58.720 --> 1:14:00.840]  They always project and they preview.
[1:14:00.840 --> 1:14:04.520]  They preview what they're going to do by what they accuse you of doing.
[1:14:04.520 --> 1:14:09.160]  So when they do make accusations they know are false, the Daily Beast knows are false.
[1:14:09.160 --> 1:14:10.560]  Will Summer knows are false.
[1:14:10.560 --> 1:14:12.880]  But you said him a notice and we're suing people.
[1:14:12.880 --> 1:14:13.880]  We're not playing games.
[1:14:13.880 --> 1:14:14.880]  That's right.
[1:14:14.880 --> 1:14:15.880]  We're suing the young turds.
[1:14:15.880 --> 1:14:16.880]  Exactly.
[1:14:16.880 --> 1:14:22.400]  So no longer will people be allowed to lie and libel with immunity and impunity.
[1:14:22.400 --> 1:14:28.960]  People cannot allow any, it was public criticism of court proceedings in the south in the 1960s
[1:14:28.960 --> 1:14:34.000]  that cleaned up what was happening in the south in the 1960s that protected and expanded
[1:14:34.000 --> 1:14:35.000]  civil rights.
[1:14:35.000 --> 1:14:41.760]  It is critical, essential, fundamental, elemental that people make public commentaries foundational
[1:14:41.760 --> 1:14:45.840]  to the freedoms of the country that they, if they disagree with what the court is doing.
[1:14:45.840 --> 1:14:46.840]  Absolutely.
[1:14:46.840 --> 1:14:50.720]  Jacob Engels, other points, my friend, I mean, because I know you're not trying to be a drama
[1:14:50.720 --> 1:14:51.720]  queen here on air.
[1:14:51.720 --> 1:14:53.760]  I mean, you've, you've been through some real meat riders.
[1:14:53.760 --> 1:14:57.040]  I guess you've been advised not to get into it on air, but I mean, they've really come
[1:14:57.040 --> 1:14:58.200]  out for you and others there.
[1:14:58.200 --> 1:15:02.480]  And I've had lawyers coming on, uh, that were ready to come on the Stone's lawyers.
[1:15:02.480 --> 1:15:03.880]  Tyler Nixon's a friend.
[1:15:03.880 --> 1:15:05.160]  He won't even talk to me right now.
[1:15:05.160 --> 1:15:06.160]  They're all been threatened.
[1:15:06.160 --> 1:15:07.160]  I know it went on the courtroom.
[1:15:07.160 --> 1:15:10.520]  Well, it's just a very sad thing, Alex.
[1:15:10.520 --> 1:15:16.680]  What Robert just talked about, uh, with the censorship and with the lying without being
[1:15:16.680 --> 1:15:19.960]  held accountable, here's, here's the process.
[1:15:19.960 --> 1:15:20.960]  They censor you.
[1:15:20.960 --> 1:15:24.160]  They cut your tongue out, then they cut your hands off.
[1:15:24.160 --> 1:15:25.160]  You can't write.
[1:15:25.160 --> 1:15:26.160]  You can't speak.
[1:15:26.160 --> 1:15:27.160]  You can't write.
[1:15:27.160 --> 1:15:31.360]  And then they can defame you and lie about you and you'd have no recourse.
[1:15:31.360 --> 1:15:34.320]  If I had millions of dollars, maybe I could mount lawsuits.
[1:15:34.320 --> 1:15:38.240]  Maybe I can hold these people accountable, but the average everyday American, we don't
[1:15:38.240 --> 1:15:39.240]  have that power.
[1:15:39.240 --> 1:15:44.480]  So the only power we have is to come on programs like InfoWars to talk to people like you, Alex,
[1:15:44.480 --> 1:15:48.040]  and Mr. Barnes and others and talk to our friends in the streets and say, hell no, we
[1:15:48.040 --> 1:15:49.040]  won't put up with that.
[1:15:49.040 --> 1:15:52.480]  We're going to shift gears and all the other big subjects and impeachment and everything
[1:15:52.480 --> 1:15:55.440]  because there's been big developments, folks, the biggest, but we've got to come back and
[1:15:55.440 --> 1:15:57.640]  finish up on this point.
[1:15:57.640 --> 1:16:00.680]  We can all agree these are troubled times, right?
[1:16:00.680 --> 1:16:06.000]  So do you know who's on your wireless network, whether it's a big company selling your data

[1:17:02.040 --> 1:17:06.240]  levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[1:17:06.240 --> 1:17:11.120]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes, and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat

[1:17:14.760 --> 1:17:19.280]  Remember how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives

[1:17:27.840 --> 1:17:28.840]  healthier I feel.
[1:17:28.840 --> 1:17:31.480]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[1:17:31.480 --> 1:17:36.680]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative

[1:17:58.680 --> 1:18:02.840]  The time has come to defy the thought police.
[1:18:02.840 --> 1:18:06.360]  They are banning hundreds and hundreds of symbols every year.
[1:18:06.360 --> 1:18:11.720]  They're waging war on communication itself, as the Fabian Socialists promised they would
[1:18:11.720 --> 1:18:15.800]  do more than 70 years ago from their command base in England.
[1:18:15.800 --> 1:18:19.600]  We've had Oxford come out and ban clapping.
[1:18:19.600 --> 1:18:24.360]  The ADL and others will literally bankrupt you, kick you out of college, destroy you.
[1:18:24.360 --> 1:18:26.040]  Have you arrested in some areas?
[1:18:26.040 --> 1:18:32.160]  If you do the OK symbol that's the international sign language symbol for OK, they know what
[1:18:32.160 --> 1:18:33.160]  they're doing.
[1:18:33.160 --> 1:18:36.320]  These people are authoritarians and they're dangerous.
[1:18:36.320 --> 1:18:40.560]  And the answer to their attack on speech is to exercise it in their face.
[1:18:40.560 --> 1:18:45.720]  We have a, it's OK to be OK politically incorrect ball cap, it's black and white, very nice
[1:18:45.720 --> 1:18:50.360]  as the OK symbol on it, it's a great way to start conversations, infowars.com is on the

[1:18:55.880 --> 1:18:59.800]  having a great hat.
[1:18:59.800 --> 1:19:03.160]  Folks ask me, Alex, why do you have two different types of iodine?
[1:19:03.160 --> 1:19:09.680]  Well, that's because different types of physiology, different types of metabolic systems and people
[1:19:09.680 --> 1:19:11.360]  will like different formulas.
[1:19:11.360 --> 1:19:13.920]  It's just that simple.
[1:19:13.920 --> 1:19:18.960]  X3 is the deep earth crystal iodine and two other types because some people need all three
[1:19:18.960 --> 1:19:23.600]  types to absorb, others like the pure atomic iodine.
[1:19:23.600 --> 1:19:28.000]  Get both, they're both great for you, whichever one you like, use that and give the other
[1:19:28.000 --> 1:19:30.280]  to family or friends.
[1:19:30.280 --> 1:19:33.640]  Come line, iodine is essential, that's why I harp on it.
[1:19:33.640 --> 1:19:37.960]  The globalist want you to be deficient in it for a lot of reasons.
[1:19:37.960 --> 1:19:41.080]  Lower IQ, makes you sluggish, you don't live as long.
[1:19:41.080 --> 1:19:42.080]  It's simple.
[1:19:42.080 --> 1:19:48.560]  Get your high quality iodine at infowarsstore.com and help fund the Info War, infowarsstore.com.
[1:19:48.560 --> 1:19:53.120]  We've got a huge sale running right now but it's about to end, it's the iodine challenge.
[1:19:53.120 --> 1:20:01.520]  Both types of iodine with selenium for 60% off together.
[1:20:01.520 --> 1:20:31.360]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:31.520 --> 1:20:46.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, Mark Zaid is the supposed whistleblower's lawyer and going down the
[1:20:46.760 --> 1:20:53.720]  rabbit hole with him we found what we always find, what you always find.
[1:20:53.720 --> 1:21:01.720]  We'll be covering that after our guest leaves us here in just a moment.
[1:21:01.720 --> 1:21:05.520]  Going back to Jacob Ingalls, the Central Florida Post, they're covering the trial with Roger
[1:21:05.520 --> 1:21:06.520]  Stone.
[1:21:06.520 --> 1:21:11.960]  I wanted to hold him over because he hit something beyond Central, beyond Paramount.
[1:21:11.960 --> 1:21:16.240]  He was saying once they silence you, then they can lie about you, then they can put
[1:21:16.240 --> 1:21:19.400]  you in prison and they're trying to put him in prison for covering the trial.
[1:21:19.400 --> 1:21:23.800]  They're calling for me to be arrested for wanting to murder the jury.
[1:21:23.800 --> 1:21:28.120]  It's all over the news because we had the grim reaper talking about Epstein on the show
[1:21:28.120 --> 1:21:30.600]  and also talked about the trial.
[1:21:30.600 --> 1:21:33.840]  It just must be that.
[1:21:33.840 --> 1:21:36.520]  Isn't that amazing, ladies and gentlemen?
[1:21:36.520 --> 1:21:40.560]  So I wanted you to speak to the importance of infowars because we don't talk about that
[1:21:40.560 --> 1:21:49.560]  enough, independent media that is radio, TV, with journalists, reporters, lawyers, researchers,
[1:21:49.560 --> 1:21:54.800]  guests, that's why they fear infowars in congressional hearings at the leftist-controlled CIA and
[1:21:54.800 --> 1:21:58.160]  the House Armed Services Committee.
[1:21:58.160 --> 1:22:00.520]  They call us Russian agents.
[1:22:00.520 --> 1:22:05.520]  That's the non-military politicos and say that I need to be silenced, but it's not because
[1:22:05.520 --> 1:22:06.520]  we're Russian.
[1:22:06.520 --> 1:22:13.000]  No, it's because we're loyal Americans who won't back down when a judge is trying to
[1:22:13.000 --> 1:22:19.120]  appoint an Obama official to oversee the jury and the railroading of Roger Stone and its
[1:22:19.120 --> 1:22:20.120]  Supreme Court rulings.
[1:22:20.120 --> 1:22:24.440]  We have a right to do that, and then they want me arrested and then lie and say I threatened
[1:22:24.440 --> 1:22:25.440]  the jury.
[1:22:25.440 --> 1:22:26.440]  Incredible, Jacob Ingalls.
[1:22:26.440 --> 1:22:30.360]  So finish up what you were saying because we ran into the break and you were unable
[1:22:30.360 --> 1:22:32.240]  to finish, but this is so important.
[1:22:32.240 --> 1:22:33.240]  Absolutely.
[1:22:33.240 --> 1:22:40.600]  What you just said, Alex, is really the point of what's going on in America today, and if
[1:22:40.600 --> 1:22:44.160]  we didn't have things like infowars or other independent alternative media, and by the
[1:22:44.160 --> 1:22:49.760]  way, Alex, you welcome on liberals, you welcome on leftists, you allow progressives to come
[1:22:49.760 --> 1:22:51.760]  speak their mind on your platform.
[1:22:51.760 --> 1:22:53.400]  Oh, we wish they would come on.
[1:22:53.400 --> 1:22:54.400]  They won't do it.
[1:22:54.400 --> 1:22:59.680]  Well, you know, I've seen in particular one guy that I've done on quite frequently, Brad
[1:22:59.680 --> 1:23:04.520]  Chatford, and he's a progressive, he's a far left guy, but he's reasonable, and he's
[1:23:04.520 --> 1:23:09.000]  come on the program, he's debated people, and he's held conversation.
[1:23:09.000 --> 1:23:12.520]  You allow that on your platform, CNN doesn't allow that.
[1:23:12.520 --> 1:23:17.080]  Nobody else allows that because they're afraid of a fair and free exchange of ideas.
[1:23:17.080 --> 1:23:21.960]  That's what we need more of in America, because if we close each other off and we don't speak
[1:23:21.960 --> 1:23:25.160]  to one another, we don't interact with one another, and we're constantly in our phones
[1:23:25.160 --> 1:23:31.600]  just droning around our lives, we are getting lost in the technocracy, we're getting lost
[1:23:31.600 --> 1:23:34.400]  in this political whirlwind of crap.
[1:23:34.400 --> 1:23:39.280]  And we need the courage to stand up and say, clapping is allowed at Oxford, which they've
[1:23:39.280 --> 1:23:44.720]  banned as hate speech, and the okay symbol means okay, not Nazism, like the ADL says.
[1:23:44.720 --> 1:23:48.280]  We have to stop letting the left take over all symbols and control things.
[1:23:48.280 --> 1:23:51.000]  It's very, very dangerous, Robert Barnes, constitutional lawyer.
[1:23:51.000 --> 1:23:52.000]  Oh yeah, no doubt about it.
[1:23:52.000 --> 1:23:55.480]  I mean, what's happening is this trial, it reminds people of what people's constitutional
[1:23:55.480 --> 1:23:59.760]  rights are, and what's happening is a broader pattern is the media is trying to discourage
[1:23:59.760 --> 1:24:03.480]  people from exercising their constitutional rights, from exercising their constitutional
[1:24:03.480 --> 1:24:04.480]  remedies.
[1:24:04.480 --> 1:24:08.480]  That's why there's this effort to demonize anyone questioning the jury to intimidate
[1:24:08.480 --> 1:24:12.160]  the rest of the public into not questioning what's happening in jury selection.
[1:24:12.160 --> 1:24:15.760]  That the same way they tried to demonize looking at Wikileaks information, the same way they
[1:24:15.760 --> 1:24:19.720]  tried to demonize disclosing the whistleblower information, part of a broader pattern of
[1:24:19.720 --> 1:24:23.800]  lying to people about their legal rights so they don't know their remedies so that those
[1:24:23.800 --> 1:24:26.320]  remedies are not enforced, and that's how the Constitution dies.
[1:24:26.320 --> 1:24:29.720]  And they're trying to set that precedent, this was done in Europe and other areas.
[1:24:29.720 --> 1:24:30.720]  This is formulaic.
[1:24:30.720 --> 1:24:35.360]  Take a man goes, God's people be talking to you each day throughout the trial because
[1:24:35.360 --> 1:24:38.720]  this affects us all, and I just feel so much for Roger.
[1:24:38.720 --> 1:24:42.280]  The empathy is out of selfishness because we know we're next.
[1:24:42.280 --> 1:24:46.280]  We're all Roger Stone now, and I decided to be more like Spartacus and fight back against
[1:24:46.280 --> 1:24:47.280]  this, and I know you are.
[1:24:47.280 --> 1:24:50.200]  And the greatest part about this fight against evil is they get to meet other great people
[1:24:50.200 --> 1:24:53.200]  like you and Robert Barnes and the great audience of activists out there.
[1:24:53.200 --> 1:24:54.200]  So thank you.
[1:24:54.200 --> 1:24:57.280]  Onward, victory or death, Alex.
[1:24:57.280 --> 1:25:01.640]  As Colonel Travis said, victory or death, it really does come down to that.
[1:25:01.640 --> 1:25:03.600]  They're not going to give us any other choice now.
[1:25:03.600 --> 1:25:05.320]  They tell us on the streets, they want to kill us.
[1:25:05.320 --> 1:25:06.600]  That's who these people are.
[1:25:06.600 --> 1:25:10.400]  They've been completely radicalized and they're foaming at the mouth.
[1:25:10.400 --> 1:25:14.760]  Now, let's get into the big story that ties into Epstein and everything else and just
[1:25:14.760 --> 1:25:18.360]  this whole atmosphere of media cover up, we're not supposed to question trials, not supposed
[1:25:18.360 --> 1:25:23.000]  to question the fake impeachment, you're not supposed to call for due process.
[1:25:23.000 --> 1:25:32.400]  Mark Zaid is the lawyer for this supposed whistleblower who, again, has no actual proof
[1:25:32.400 --> 1:25:37.040]  of what he's saying, we're going to get to that coming up.
[1:25:37.040 --> 1:25:42.800]  But President Trump last night spoke about this individual in a rally that he held, here's
[1:25:42.800 --> 1:25:45.000]  what he had to say.
[1:25:45.000 --> 1:25:50.200]  A lot of things have happened because, you know, I don't know if you saw, I just got
[1:25:50.200 --> 1:25:53.600]  off, I'm coming off the plane and they hand me, look at this character.
[1:25:53.600 --> 1:25:56.720]  Okay, they just hand me this story.
[1:25:56.720 --> 1:26:01.600]  Koo has started, whistleblower's attorney said in 2017, you know when that was?
[1:26:01.600 --> 1:26:03.600]  That was a long time ago.
[1:26:03.600 --> 1:26:05.560]  It's all a hoax.
[1:26:05.560 --> 1:26:14.120]  They say January 2017, a Koo has started and the impeachment will follow ultimately.
[1:26:14.120 --> 1:26:16.600]  It's all a hoax.
[1:26:16.600 --> 1:26:17.760]  It's a scam.
[1:26:17.760 --> 1:26:19.120]  And you know who helps them?
[1:26:19.120 --> 1:26:25.400]  These people right back here, the media.
[1:26:25.400 --> 1:26:30.240]  And then it said, oops, their light's going to go off, the CNN light is going to go off.
[1:26:30.240 --> 1:26:41.200]  They said, from the lawyer, a sleazeball, it said, I predict at CNN will play a key
[1:26:41.200 --> 1:26:47.440]  role in at-wheel Donald Trump, not finishing out his first term.
[1:26:47.440 --> 1:26:48.440]  Can you believe this?
[1:26:48.440 --> 1:26:52.120]  This is all, and this was done a long time ago.
[1:26:52.120 --> 1:26:58.840]  Then he goes, as one falls, two more will take their place, referring to outgoing Trump
[1:26:58.840 --> 1:27:04.600]  administration employees who, by the way, have been put through hell by the sleaze back
[1:27:04.600 --> 1:27:10.200]  there and by crooked politicians.
[1:27:10.200 --> 1:27:12.440]  That's President Trump in Monroe, Louisiana.
[1:27:12.440 --> 1:27:13.760]  Now we've got a few minutes left in this segment.
[1:27:13.760 --> 1:27:17.120]  We come back for TV viewers, you're going to be sickened, but we're going to show it
[1:27:17.120 --> 1:27:18.120]  to you.
[1:27:18.120 --> 1:27:20.200]  Radio listeners, this is an Appalachos of Watson article.
[1:27:20.200 --> 1:27:24.120]  I got sent this morning text messages about big national reporters as I was reading about
[1:27:24.120 --> 1:27:29.000]  it at Impal Wars at 6 a.m., I was getting text messages with more on this guy saying,
[1:27:29.000 --> 1:27:30.000]  hey, did you see this?
[1:27:30.000 --> 1:27:31.000]  Did you see that?
[1:27:31.000 --> 1:27:33.160]  And I would expect you'll see this on Fox News tonight.
[1:27:33.160 --> 1:27:35.960]  I'm just going to give you a little hint.
[1:27:35.960 --> 1:27:43.240]  But this individual who said all of this, well, it turns out he likes John Podesta, he works
[1:27:43.240 --> 1:27:48.400]  with him, and it turns out he goes to Disney World by himself, and he's got a very interesting
[1:27:48.400 --> 1:27:53.840]  YouTube channel where he's a big fan of pre-pubescent girls, and he likes to take
[1:27:53.840 --> 1:27:57.760]  photos of himself by himself at playgrounds with little kids in the background.
[1:27:57.760 --> 1:28:01.080]  That's well-known online, exactly why people do that, he's just letting folks know what
[1:28:01.080 --> 1:28:02.640]  he's a fan of.
[1:28:02.640 --> 1:28:04.120]  And so we're going to talk more about that.
[1:28:04.120 --> 1:28:08.960]  But all of these guys, all the insurance policy, we had to get Page and Strock's text
[1:28:08.960 --> 1:28:11.400]  to get that Congress had to subpoena them.
[1:28:11.400 --> 1:28:15.240]  These people are out in the open saying we're going to set Trump up and make stuff up.
[1:28:15.240 --> 1:28:19.160]  From the inception, they've been hostile to Trump and anti-Trump, been orchestrating efforts
[1:28:19.160 --> 1:28:25.400]  to, for example, so not long after the 2016 election, I got into a dispute with Mr. Zayed
[1:28:25.400 --> 1:28:31.400]  or Zayed, however his name is pronunciated, on Twitter over issues related to a wide range
[1:28:31.400 --> 1:28:32.400]  of these issues.
[1:28:32.400 --> 1:28:36.720]  So it's not a surprise that he's a central figure in the effort to try to stage a coup
[1:28:36.720 --> 1:28:41.320]  against the president that he bragged about participating in almost two years ago.
[1:28:41.320 --> 1:28:49.440]  And then this will be a bridge into Epstein, also a fan of young girls, I mean I'm sure
[1:28:49.440 --> 1:28:53.560]  this guy is just different, I'm curious, I'm just saying it's important, it all ties
[1:28:53.560 --> 1:28:55.400]  together, stay with us.
[1:28:55.400 --> 1:28:58.720]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[1:28:58.720 --> 1:29:02.640]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[1:29:02.640 --> 1:29:04.200]  I sued the IRS and won.
[1:29:04.200 --> 1:29:07.160]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[1:29:07.160 --> 1:29:10.440]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with
[1:29:10.440 --> 1:29:12.680]  tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[1:29:12.680 --> 1:29:14.000]  I can help you too.

[1:29:58.600 --> 1:30:02.760]  The time has come to defy the thought police.
[1:30:02.760 --> 1:30:07.320]  They are banning hundreds and hundreds of symbols every year, they're waging war on
[1:30:07.320 --> 1:30:13.200]  communication itself, as the Fabian socialists promised they would do more than 70 years
[1:30:13.200 --> 1:30:15.680]  ago from their command base in England.
[1:30:15.680 --> 1:30:22.200]  We've had Oxford come out and ban clapping, the ADL and others will literally bankrupt
[1:30:22.200 --> 1:30:26.320]  you, kick you out of college, destroy you, have you arrested in some areas, if you do
[1:30:26.320 --> 1:30:31.960]  the okay symbol that's the international sign language symbol for okay, they know what
[1:30:31.960 --> 1:30:36.240]  they're doing, these people are authoritarians and they're dangerous.
[1:30:36.240 --> 1:30:40.480]  And the answer to their attack on speech is to exercise it in their face.
[1:30:40.480 --> 1:30:45.280]  We have a, it's okay to be okay politically incorrect ball cap, it's black and white,
[1:30:45.280 --> 1:30:50.000]  very nice as the okay symbol on it, it's a great way to start conversations, infowars.com

[1:31:03.960 --> 1:31:08.720]  are deficient in some things and not in others, there's a lot of factors that go into this
[1:31:08.720 --> 1:31:13.440]  and I'm not telling you something that you don't know, but I'm here to tell you.

[1:31:58.400 --> 1:32:00.480]  The Alex Jones Show.
[1:32:00.480 --> 1:32:05.800]  A few days ago, my 11-year-old daughter came to me and she had her digital textbook and
[1:32:05.800 --> 1:32:10.560]  she said, dad, they're teaching us about the periodic table and I clicked on iodine and
[1:32:10.560 --> 1:32:15.600]  it says that 2 billion people have low IQs or mentally retarded on the planet Earth because
[1:32:15.600 --> 1:32:19.320]  they didn't get enough iodine, that's what you say all the time, but I've heard people
[1:32:19.320 --> 1:32:23.680]  say you're crazy and it's not true, but dad, it's right here on the periodic table when
[1:32:23.680 --> 1:32:28.360]  I click it saying exactly what you said and I said, I know, honey, that's why I have you
[1:32:28.360 --> 1:32:34.520]  take a high quality nutraceutical grade iodine is because it's why you're so vibrant, why
[1:32:34.520 --> 1:32:40.160]  you're so alive, it's one of the reasons that you're so much healthier and smarter than
[1:32:40.160 --> 1:32:45.080]  most of the kids you're age and it just really blew her away to read it there for herself
[1:32:45.080 --> 1:32:51.040]  and to know that 2 billion people, ladies and gentlemen, 2 billion are mentally retarded
[1:32:51.040 --> 1:32:54.680]  on the face of the Earth right now because of iodine deficiency, research it and find
[1:32:54.680 --> 1:32:56.360]  out for yourself now.
[1:32:56.360 --> 1:32:57.720]  Infowars.com.
[1:32:57.720 --> 1:33:13.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:33:13.400 --> 1:33:24.120]  Waging War on Corruption, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:24.120 --> 1:33:29.840]  One reason the forces of corruption and evil, and that's really who they are, it's completely
[1:33:29.840 --> 1:33:37.120]  out in the open now, are so powerful is that they are single-minded, they are arrogant,
[1:33:37.120 --> 1:33:38.680]  they believe they're invincible.
[1:33:38.680 --> 1:33:43.640]  Now, that's also one of the reasons they can be defeated.
[1:33:43.640 --> 1:33:50.640]  Mark Zaid, the lawyer for the supposed whistleblower who we'll get into who is already testified,
[1:33:50.640 --> 1:33:53.760]  but they wanted to call it a whistleblower because it has that gravitas name and they
[1:33:53.760 --> 1:33:58.640]  never find out who originally said it because it's not true.
[1:33:58.640 --> 1:34:03.000]  And that's why they don't want any criticism of the quote, whistleblowers, that's everybody
[1:34:03.000 --> 1:34:04.000]  now testifying.
[1:34:04.000 --> 1:34:08.920]  So the people testifying say they came there because of a whistleblower, but it's all of
[1:34:08.920 --> 1:34:12.080]  them making it up together, that's been proven.
[1:34:12.080 --> 1:34:16.440]  The media wants you to move on from that, it's now been expanded out to the vice president,
[1:34:16.440 --> 1:34:20.960]  oh, now he's part of the investigation, they want him gone, of course, it was always Trump
[1:34:20.960 --> 1:34:24.960]  at first, I said once they initiate the official impeachment inquiry, they'll add the vice
[1:34:24.960 --> 1:34:29.480]  president, everybody else because they've told us it's about Pelosi, next in line, and
[1:34:29.480 --> 1:34:33.280]  then she can appoint the vice president, Herr Hillary.
[1:34:33.280 --> 1:34:40.920]  But why would Mark Zaid, back in January of 2017, as the presidents being inaugurated
[1:34:40.920 --> 1:34:49.880]  say, the coup has started January 30, 10 days after Trump sworn in, as one falls, two more
[1:34:49.880 --> 1:34:58.360]  will take their place, two more, Hillary, and of course Pelosi, who has started first
[1:34:58.360 --> 1:35:03.760]  of many steps, hashtag rebellion, hashtag impeachment, will follow ultimately January
[1:35:03.760 --> 1:35:04.760]  30.
[1:35:04.760 --> 1:35:09.160]  You see the last half part of the hashtag, lawyers, that lawyers would play a critical
[1:35:09.160 --> 1:35:13.920]  role in this effort to undermine constitutional freedom in the United States, which is a sad
[1:35:13.920 --> 1:35:14.920]  statement about what they'll be doing.
[1:35:14.920 --> 1:35:19.400]  And then to attack us, all the Democratic Party's 30 plus lawsuits against us.
[1:35:19.400 --> 1:35:24.680]  The institutional effort of weaponizing the law for politicized purposes is part of this
[1:35:24.680 --> 1:35:26.760]  broader scale of activity that's taken place.
[1:35:26.760 --> 1:35:32.680]  And it's a conscious move, and he goes on, we will get rid of him.
[1:35:32.680 --> 1:35:35.800]  And this country is strong enough to survive him, even and his supporters.
[1:35:35.800 --> 1:35:36.800]  We have to.
[1:35:36.800 --> 1:35:41.960]  And 45 years from now, we might be recalling stories regarding the impeachment of real Donald
[1:35:41.960 --> 1:35:42.960]  Trump.
[1:35:42.960 --> 1:35:45.840]  I'll be old, but it'll be well worth the wait.
[1:35:45.840 --> 1:35:51.320]  And then here he is, whistleblower attorney, alleged YouTube channel enclose, and it's
[1:35:51.320 --> 1:35:55.280]  10 years old, it's his YouTube channel, videos of Disney girls, it's media appearances he'd
[1:35:55.280 --> 1:36:00.160]  made, and then it's girls before they grew up.
[1:36:00.160 --> 1:36:09.640]  Selena Gomez, from a child to woman, top 10 Disney girls, top 10 Disney channel stars.
[1:36:09.640 --> 1:36:12.360]  And then he tells you on his Twitter, well, let's put up his Twitter for everybody.
[1:36:12.360 --> 1:36:17.800]  And the reason this is important is, you scratch the surface, and it's always the same, ladies
[1:36:17.800 --> 1:36:18.800]  and gentlemen.
[1:36:18.800 --> 1:36:22.040]  And that's what I've explained, why people need to stop being so naive.
[1:36:22.040 --> 1:36:26.520]  Just like the whistleblower's lawyer is very into Disney child actresses, I would have
[1:36:26.520 --> 1:36:32.160]  joined the FBI for the free Disney pass, as he said, and let's, let's show some of those
[1:36:32.160 --> 1:36:37.120]  tweets him at Disney World with little kids in the background says, I like to come here
[1:36:37.120 --> 1:36:42.160]  by myself, he tells you, oh, it's my favorite place there.
[1:36:42.160 --> 1:36:47.680]  And you can see all the photos of him at Disney World with the characters and him sitting
[1:36:47.680 --> 1:36:53.320]  there with the minion.
[1:36:53.320 --> 1:36:55.760]  That's what's going on, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:36:55.760 --> 1:36:56.760]  There it is right there.
[1:36:56.760 --> 1:36:59.240]  Let's, let's put that behind me on the screen.
[1:36:59.240 --> 1:37:04.960]  He also hangs out at water parks for kids with photos of himself with kids in the background.
[1:37:04.960 --> 1:37:06.720]  He tells you, I go there alone.
[1:37:06.720 --> 1:37:11.880]  Now on Twitter in places when they tell you that, well, it just means they like, they like
[1:37:11.880 --> 1:37:15.680]  kids, they like, they like playgrounds, they, they're men that hang around at playgrounds
[1:37:15.680 --> 1:37:17.600]  by themselves.
[1:37:17.600 --> 1:37:19.480]  And of course, he's friends with Podesta.
[1:37:19.480 --> 1:37:24.720]  You've known him a while, but, but, but what's bigger, him admitting it's a coon that it's
[1:37:24.720 --> 1:37:28.080]  all made up or, or this added thing.
[1:37:28.080 --> 1:37:29.560]  It just seems that there's a prerequisite.
[1:37:29.560 --> 1:37:33.600]  Well, I mean, there are people who like Disney for entirely innocent and innocuous reasons.
[1:37:33.600 --> 1:37:35.000]  And I'm sure that's it.
[1:37:35.000 --> 1:37:40.360]  And so the, but the political commentary clearly shows there's not a lot of people that like
[1:37:40.360 --> 1:37:43.360]  Disney as much as he apparently does, but that that's his prerogative.
[1:37:43.360 --> 1:37:48.360]  The, but what is problematic is to go out and tell the world your part, like water parks
[1:37:48.360 --> 1:37:49.360]  by himself too.
[1:37:49.360 --> 1:37:50.360]  Yeah.
[1:37:50.360 --> 1:37:51.360]  Yeah.
[1:37:51.360 --> 1:37:54.040]  I've never been a fan of water parks for many reasons, but that's a story.
[1:37:54.040 --> 1:37:55.040]  You know, yeah.
[1:37:55.040 --> 1:37:56.040]  People have different tastes.
[1:37:56.040 --> 1:37:57.040]  Yeah.
[1:37:57.040 --> 1:37:58.040]  Exactly.
[1:37:58.040 --> 1:38:00.880]  Some people like the, the Spongebob and like the, uh, no, I do like that character.
[1:38:00.880 --> 1:38:01.880]  That's a cool character.
[1:38:01.880 --> 1:38:02.880]  The Minions.
[1:38:02.880 --> 1:38:03.880]  The Minions.
[1:38:03.880 --> 1:38:04.880]  The Minions are fun.
[1:38:04.880 --> 1:38:05.880]  The Minions are fun.
[1:38:05.880 --> 1:38:06.880]  There should be an Alex Jones Minion.
[1:38:06.880 --> 1:38:07.880]  Oh, yeah.
[1:38:07.880 --> 1:38:12.080]  We have a, I feel like that's kind of my real life.
[1:38:12.080 --> 1:38:13.080]  Yeah.
[1:38:13.080 --> 1:38:14.080]  Yeah.
[1:38:14.080 --> 1:38:17.600]  Uh, but his political commentary is highly problematic across the board and he's someone
[1:38:17.600 --> 1:38:22.200]  who doesn't hold up to scrutiny well because he's been presenting himself as an independent
[1:38:22.200 --> 1:38:29.480]  nonpartisan, apolitical lawyer who started a whistleblower organization in 2017 that
[1:38:29.480 --> 1:38:35.320]  he claimed at the time had nothing to do with politically pursuing Trump for punitive purposes.
[1:38:35.320 --> 1:38:37.400]  Now it appears to all have been part of a setup.
[1:38:37.400 --> 1:38:41.600]  It all appears to have been part of a trap while he says it is that he himself is bragging
[1:38:41.600 --> 1:38:44.320]  about it to his social media friends and the social media.
[1:38:44.320 --> 1:38:48.080]  He's also bragging about visiting Disney by himself to the president reference.
[1:38:48.080 --> 1:38:52.760]  And so I think what that shows is a certain context of behavior in terms of being hostile
[1:38:52.760 --> 1:38:56.160]  to President Trump and that this was politically set up from the get-go.
[1:38:56.160 --> 1:38:59.640]  And the message was, now he does do a lot of national security legal work.
[1:38:59.640 --> 1:39:01.440]  So he knows all the internal protocols.
[1:39:01.440 --> 1:39:02.440]  He knows what the rules are.
[1:39:02.440 --> 1:39:04.440]  He told me looking into him, he works with Podesta.
[1:39:04.440 --> 1:39:05.440]  Yes.
[1:39:05.440 --> 1:39:09.440]  So yeah, he had Podesta on his advisory board, bragged about it as part of this organization,
[1:39:09.440 --> 1:39:10.440]  bragged about his connections.
[1:39:10.440 --> 1:39:12.400]  John Podesta with the spirit cooking, that same one?
[1:39:12.400 --> 1:39:16.480]  That's the John Podesta of Hillary Clinton running Hillary Clinton's campaign.
[1:39:16.480 --> 1:39:17.480]  So the...
[1:39:17.480 --> 1:39:18.480]  The Aleister Crowley.
[1:39:18.480 --> 1:39:22.200]  Whose brother was involved in actual Ukrainian issues that Manafort got...
[1:39:22.200 --> 1:39:27.520]  That was Tony Podesta that did the 2007 Washington Post article about his deviant art.
[1:39:27.520 --> 1:39:29.560]  A very interesting art.
[1:39:29.560 --> 1:39:31.160]  Little kids tied up being paddled.
[1:39:31.160 --> 1:39:35.720]  There was a range of art that has been described by a range of people as deviant.
[1:39:35.720 --> 1:39:37.200]  People can make their own judgments.
[1:39:37.200 --> 1:39:43.800]  But either way, John Podesta is clearly a political partisan guy, ran Hillary Clinton's campaign.
[1:39:43.800 --> 1:39:46.520]  He's connected to Zayed by Zayed's own prominent statements.
[1:39:46.520 --> 1:39:49.480]  Zayed has said he hasn't talked to him recently.
[1:39:49.480 --> 1:39:50.960]  And that was his defense to it.
[1:39:50.960 --> 1:39:54.600]  But all of these commentaries suggest that what really happened was they set up whistleblower
[1:39:54.600 --> 1:40:00.320]  organizations for the purpose of creating a fake whistleblower story so that deep state
[1:40:00.320 --> 1:40:04.920]  operatives could effectively try to take out the president of the United States.
[1:40:04.920 --> 1:40:07.880]  They created the roadmap of them to go imagine they saw.
[1:40:07.880 --> 1:40:08.880]  Yeah, exactly.
[1:40:08.880 --> 1:40:09.880]  Exactly.
[1:40:09.880 --> 1:40:10.880]  You know, the...
[1:40:10.880 --> 1:40:13.680]  Gee, it'd be too bad if he did quid pro quo.
[1:40:13.680 --> 1:40:14.680]  Yeah, exactly.
[1:40:14.680 --> 1:40:17.400]  With the same country we wrote the fake dossier up on.
[1:40:17.400 --> 1:40:18.400]  Correct.
[1:40:18.400 --> 1:40:23.280]  Oh, and then of course it turns out the whistleblower also has worked with the lady that was involved
[1:40:23.280 --> 1:40:24.280]  creating the dossier.
[1:40:24.280 --> 1:40:28.560]  And what they're doing is, the left as a general rule is they're weaponizing the law and lawyers
[1:40:28.560 --> 1:40:33.040]  are weaponizing their political and legal skill and acumen to favor a certain political
[1:40:33.040 --> 1:40:35.760]  side of the equation and tip the tables in favor of them.
[1:40:35.760 --> 1:40:41.040]  But he seems so childlike and friendly and nice hanging out at the water parks by himself.
[1:40:41.040 --> 1:40:42.040]  And the Disney...
[1:40:42.040 --> 1:40:43.040]  I mean, look, he's a nice...
[1:40:43.040 --> 1:40:45.040]  The childlike mind here, he's not a predator.
[1:40:45.040 --> 1:40:46.040]  His public...
[1:40:46.040 --> 1:40:47.040]  He doesn't set things up.
[1:40:47.040 --> 1:40:48.040]  He's not stalking his prey.
[1:40:48.040 --> 1:40:50.880]  He's not like a hunter up there, you know, with a deer in the background, kind of showing
[1:40:50.880 --> 1:40:52.160]  you what he's going hunting for or anything.
[1:40:52.160 --> 1:40:53.160]  It's not like...
[1:40:53.160 --> 1:40:56.000]  It's not like me with a cap with a deer on or anything.
[1:40:56.000 --> 1:41:00.860]  His target projection is that he's as nice and innocent as Disney and that he's as non-partisan
[1:41:00.860 --> 1:41:02.840]  and independent as a lawyer can come.
[1:41:02.840 --> 1:41:05.280]  But the other commentary exposes a pattern of behavior.
[1:41:05.280 --> 1:41:08.000]  It's not like a bass boat, it has like a bass on the side.
[1:41:08.000 --> 1:41:10.240]  Yeah, well, clearly he was hunting...
[1:41:10.240 --> 1:41:11.640]  Like a boss animal has a deer on it.
[1:41:11.640 --> 1:41:13.320]  I mean, the image doesn't match up to the...
[1:41:13.320 --> 1:41:15.120]  He's just up there, a little kid in the background.
[1:41:15.120 --> 1:41:19.560]  Well, the image just doesn't match up to the reality of what's happening against Trump.
[1:41:19.560 --> 1:41:23.320]  That he clearly has not been taking a non-partisan, independent approach.
[1:41:23.320 --> 1:41:26.520]  Surprise, there's not crosshairs on the kid right there.
[1:41:26.520 --> 1:41:30.520]  Well, they interpret that and hold it a bunch of different ways these days.
[1:41:30.520 --> 1:41:32.520]  So in terms of the crosshairs references...
[1:41:32.520 --> 1:41:34.040]  Because we're not threatening the child.
[1:41:34.040 --> 1:41:35.040]  I just...
[1:41:35.040 --> 1:41:38.320]  You know, oh my God, the TV's come together like crosshairs there.
[1:41:38.320 --> 1:41:41.120]  I'm not threatening him because there's a crosshair right there.
[1:41:41.120 --> 1:41:43.520]  Because they'll probably say that next.
[1:41:43.520 --> 1:41:45.520]  Well, yeah, they say everything these days.
[1:41:45.520 --> 1:41:46.520]  I mean, they said...
[1:41:46.520 --> 1:41:48.520]  At the Grim Reaper with the Dessa, they said I was threatening the jury.
[1:41:48.520 --> 1:41:52.160]  The issue here is that he projects himself as nice, innocent, straightforward, independent,
[1:41:52.160 --> 1:41:53.160]  non-partisan lawyer.
[1:41:53.160 --> 1:41:56.800]  And in fact, he's setting up whistle-blower organizations as soon as President Trump is
[1:41:56.800 --> 1:42:00.640]  elected and at the same time, he's talking about impeachment at the same time.
[1:42:00.640 --> 1:42:03.800]  He's taking big-game photos about coups all the way around.
[1:42:03.800 --> 1:42:09.000]  He's talking about taking out the president using legal, weaponizing the law to do so
[1:42:09.000 --> 1:42:11.400]  long before he's actually representing the...
[1:42:11.400 --> 1:42:14.160]  Why do these guys hobby all the same thing?
[1:42:14.160 --> 1:42:16.280]  I'm sure it's completely innocent.
[1:42:16.280 --> 1:42:20.280]  Like, why are they into mountain climbing or boxing or...
[1:42:20.280 --> 1:42:23.640]  Well, I think as a general rule, you don't see a lot of what I would call the sort of
[1:42:23.640 --> 1:42:25.920]  legal left, the professional class as a whole.
[1:42:25.920 --> 1:42:30.120]  They just all seem to be hanging out at parks by themselves with children.
[1:42:30.120 --> 1:42:32.480]  What they are not, is that they're not traditionally...
[1:42:32.480 --> 1:42:34.840]  Remember, Sandusky had his house right by the children's park?
[1:42:34.840 --> 1:42:38.640]  It was a disproportionately few number of them were veterans and involved in sort of
[1:42:38.640 --> 1:42:41.720]  what you could call traditional American activities of that kind.
[1:42:41.720 --> 1:42:42.720]  And what they pointed...
[1:42:42.720 --> 1:42:44.600]  Well, isn't this a man going to Disney World by yourself?
[1:42:44.600 --> 1:42:45.600]  It's kind of Americana.
[1:42:45.600 --> 1:42:47.600]  Well, for some of this, absolutely.
[1:42:47.600 --> 1:42:48.600]  And so the...
[1:42:48.600 --> 1:42:49.600]  So he's an Americana type guy?
[1:42:49.600 --> 1:42:52.920]  Well, it projects an image of innocence rather than partisan intention.
[1:42:52.920 --> 1:42:53.920]  He's a very innocent man.
[1:42:53.920 --> 1:42:54.920]  We'll be right back.
[1:42:54.920 --> 1:43:01.840]  The time has come to defy the thought police.
[1:43:01.840 --> 1:43:05.360]  They are banning hundreds and hundreds of symbols every year.
[1:43:05.360 --> 1:43:10.720]  They're waging war on communication itself as a Thavian socialist promise they would
[1:43:10.720 --> 1:43:14.920]  do more than 70 years ago from their command base in England.
[1:43:14.920 --> 1:43:18.600]  We've had Oxford come out and ban clapping.
[1:43:18.600 --> 1:43:23.360]  The ADL and others will literally bankrupt you, kick you out of college, destroy you,
[1:43:23.360 --> 1:43:25.040]  have you arrested in some areas.
[1:43:25.040 --> 1:43:31.040]  If you do the OK symbol that's the international sign language symbol for OK, they know what
[1:43:31.040 --> 1:43:32.160]  they're doing.
[1:43:32.160 --> 1:43:35.320]  These people are authoritarians and they're dangerous.
[1:43:35.320 --> 1:43:39.560]  And the answer to their attack on speech is to exercise it in their face.
[1:43:39.560 --> 1:43:40.560]  We have a...
[1:43:40.560 --> 1:43:43.440]  It's OK to be OK, politically incorrect, ball cap.
[1:43:43.440 --> 1:43:46.280]  It's black and white, very nice, has the OK symbol on it.

[1:44:34.520 --> 1:44:35.520]  markup.

[1:44:39.120 --> 1:44:40.120]  deal.
[1:44:40.120 --> 1:44:41.120]  $147.
[1:44:41.120 --> 1:44:42.120]  I almost...
[1:44:42.120 --> 1:44:46.120]  I've told the guy, like, this cuts into the market so I'm just slow, people don't appreciate
[1:44:46.120 --> 1:44:47.120]  it.
[1:44:47.120 --> 1:44:52.000]  This is our audience gets infowarsstore.com, there's only a few hundred of these left at
[1:44:52.000 --> 1:45:00.040]  this price and then more to come in until next year.
[1:45:00.040 --> 1:45:03.480]  Folks ask me, Alex, why do you have two different types of iodine?
[1:45:03.480 --> 1:45:09.880]  Well, that's because different types of physiology, different types of metabolic systems and people
[1:45:09.880 --> 1:45:14.160]  will like different formulas, it's just that simple.
[1:45:14.160 --> 1:45:18.760]  This three is the Deep Earth Crystal iodine and two other types because some people need
[1:45:18.760 --> 1:45:23.840]  all three types to absorb, others like the Pure Atomic iodine.
[1:45:23.840 --> 1:45:28.240]  Get both, they're both great for you, whichever one you like, use that and give the other
[1:45:28.240 --> 1:45:30.240]  to family or friends.
[1:45:30.240 --> 1:45:33.880]  Bottom line, iodine is essential, that's why I harp on it.
[1:45:33.880 --> 1:45:39.360]  The globalist want you to be deficient in it for a lot of reasons, lower IQ, makes you
[1:45:39.360 --> 1:45:44.140]  sluggish, you don't live as long, it's simple, get your high quality iodine at infowarsstore.com

[1:45:53.400 --> 1:45:58.720]  Both types of iodine with selenium for 60% off together.
[1:45:58.720 --> 1:46:04.080]  All of our bodies are different, all of our metabolic systems are diverse, some of us
[1:46:04.080 --> 1:46:08.840]  are deficient in some things and not in others, there's a lot of factors that go into this
[1:46:08.840 --> 1:46:13.560]  and I'm not telling you something that you don't know but I'm here to tell you.

[1:47:18.040 --> 1:47:42.760]  Alex Jones, call me the hunter, that's my name, money's your friday from 11am to 3pm,
[1:47:42.760 --> 1:47:58.200]  Alex Jones is live, I'm your host Alex Jones, let's hear a little bit of this song, there's
[1:47:58.200 --> 1:48:13.760]  my name, that's my name, pretty young thing like you, there's my home again, here in Texas
[1:48:13.760 --> 1:48:16.640]  it runs coming up around Thanksgiving into January, did you go hunting, you're good shot,
[1:48:16.640 --> 1:48:22.080]  I've actually never gone hunting, we're going to go hunting for Texas big game, have you
[1:48:22.080 --> 1:48:27.760]  fun, different people hunt different things, that's true, all right, I'm going to go hunting
[1:48:27.760 --> 1:48:28.760]  for Texas.
[1:48:28.760 --> 1:48:33.600]  All right, speaking of folks that hunt different things, I want to shift gears, Katie Pavich
[1:48:33.600 --> 1:48:41.720]  ties ABC Epstein cover up to the Clintons and Stephanopoulos, no wonder ABC didn't want
[1:48:41.720 --> 1:48:46.120]  her to investigate the Clintons, quote she had the Clintons, blackmail control of powerful
[1:48:46.120 --> 1:48:51.280]  people as the house of cards begins to come down, but we're in a race as they try to impeach
[1:48:51.280 --> 1:48:56.840]  the president, so it is a race, ladies and gentlemen, your action is what ensures victory,
[1:48:56.840 --> 1:48:57.840]  let's cut his clip.
[1:48:57.840 --> 1:49:01.880]  Every time I watch this I think, she seems like a sort of a real journalist, good for
[1:49:01.880 --> 1:49:07.440]  her, there's no question executives at ABC protected Jeffrey Epstein, why do you think
[1:49:07.440 --> 1:49:08.440]  they did that?
[1:49:08.440 --> 1:49:12.720]  Well, because their star anchor's name is George Stephanopoulos, and of course George
[1:49:12.720 --> 1:49:18.120]  Stephanopoulos worked as Bill Clinton's communications director at the White House, and when was
[1:49:18.120 --> 1:49:23.320]  all of this information being given to Amy Borbach at ABC, when did she bring all of
[1:49:23.320 --> 1:49:28.440]  this to her executives to say we should put this on the air, right before our 2016 presidential
[1:49:28.440 --> 1:49:32.480]  election when Hillary Clinton was running on a Democratic ticket?
[1:49:32.480 --> 1:49:37.800]  You know, Tucker Carlson is on fire, a real journalist, and because no one else, Brian
[1:49:37.800 --> 1:49:43.640]  Stelter's defending ABC and saying just literally cover it up, the rest of the media is as well,
[1:49:43.640 --> 1:49:47.240]  CBS won't report on it, that tells you who these folks are.
[1:49:47.240 --> 1:49:50.480]  I mean no doubt about it, this is one of the biggest scandals in the history of American
[1:49:50.480 --> 1:49:56.120]  media and American crime and American politics, American law, you have someone like Epstein
[1:49:56.120 --> 1:50:00.320]  committing crime on the scale that he was committing it, according to the allegations
[1:50:00.320 --> 1:50:04.200]  against him in the indictment and that had been published elsewhere in various court
[1:50:04.200 --> 1:50:08.320]  pleadings and court proceedings, and here they had the story, they had an extraordinary
[1:50:08.320 --> 1:50:13.920]  story, an extraordinary exclusive right on the eve of the election, and they ran from
[1:50:13.920 --> 1:50:18.800]  it rather than run to it, even though the reporter on the ground wanted to cover it,
[1:50:18.800 --> 1:50:22.560]  and it's very apparent and very manifest by what Project Veritas's whistleblower was
[1:50:22.560 --> 1:50:23.960]  allowed to do.
[1:50:23.960 --> 1:50:28.280]  Interesting contrast, while they're saying you can't discuss who the jurors are for
[1:50:28.280 --> 1:50:32.800]  purposes of examining whether bias is taking place in the jury selection process, while
[1:50:32.800 --> 1:50:35.680]  they're saying you can't discuss WikiLeaks emails, and while they're saying you can't
[1:50:35.680 --> 1:50:40.160]  discuss the whistleblower's name and identity, there has been an expansive effort by the
[1:50:40.160 --> 1:50:45.000]  media, according to published reports today, to identify who provided this information to
[1:50:45.000 --> 1:50:46.000]  Project Veritas.
[1:50:46.000 --> 1:50:51.400]  So they're hunting, they're hunting whoever it is to try to prosecute them, that she's
[1:50:51.400 --> 1:50:55.080]  on video, it's a hot mic, like sometimes we're recording ads, whatever, you know, the things
[1:50:55.080 --> 1:50:59.160]  going, the background, and she's really more worried about her career, I would have really
[1:50:59.160 --> 1:51:04.200]  been famous if I brought down the Clintons, my God, the blackmelons of the kids, she's
[1:51:04.200 --> 1:51:07.800]  not even worried about the kids, she's just more worried in my view about how, you know,
[1:51:07.800 --> 1:51:14.240]  she got spiked a big story, about a sociopath, but she's just a sociopath, she's not a Dracula.
[1:51:14.240 --> 1:51:19.240]  Well, if the nature of most journalists is, unfortunately, there tends to be a tendency
[1:51:19.240 --> 1:51:24.480]  to seek fame and celebrity more so than to expose the truth as they're driving motivation
[1:51:24.480 --> 1:51:25.480]  in some cases.
[1:51:25.480 --> 1:51:26.480]  Seek victory over evil?
[1:51:26.480 --> 1:51:30.880]  Unfortunately, there isn't the same motivation shared across the journalistic profession,
[1:51:30.880 --> 1:51:34.760]  but either way, she had every personal interest in seeing the story covered, and so the fact
[1:51:34.760 --> 1:51:38.800]  that they shut it down, such an explosive story, such an exclusive story, such an extraordinary
[1:51:38.800 --> 1:51:43.680]  story, shows the scope and scale of where Epstein's corruption reached, and the degree
[1:51:43.680 --> 1:51:49.440]  to which at least somebody at ABC most likely associated the story with potentially hurting
[1:51:49.440 --> 1:51:53.840]  the Clinton campaign, which suggests that someone at ABC connected the dots between Epstein
[1:51:53.840 --> 1:51:54.840]  and Clinton.
[1:51:54.840 --> 1:51:59.400]  In addition, George Stephanopoulos attended Epstein events in New York after he had already
[1:51:59.400 --> 1:52:05.920]  pled guilty to various crimes involving underage sex activity, so there's that component.
[1:52:05.920 --> 1:52:09.840]  Stephanopoulos was also, of course, a donor to the Clinton Foundation, as President Trump
[1:52:09.840 --> 1:52:10.840]  reminded him of.
[1:52:10.840 --> 1:52:14.680]  There are tons of sickening monsters that are all into different decadences.
[1:52:14.680 --> 1:52:18.520]  Some of them want to be crapped on, others want to have sex with kids, others want to
[1:52:18.520 --> 1:52:20.240]  be hurt, others want to hurt people.
[1:52:20.240 --> 1:52:24.080]  I mean, I've been around Hollywood, folks, I couldn't get away, you open one door, it's
[1:52:24.080 --> 1:52:28.120]  one sick thing, open another, it's another sick thing, but at the bottom of it all is
[1:52:28.120 --> 1:52:33.120]  draining energy off children, raping them, torturing them, and that's who they are.
[1:52:33.120 --> 1:52:34.760]  You want to know who the globalists put in?
[1:52:34.760 --> 1:52:38.040]  People like them that go to their parties and get off on this stuff, and Epstein was
[1:52:38.040 --> 1:52:43.480]  nothing but a Mater D that delivered up the hors d'oeuvres, whatever they wanted, drugs,
[1:52:43.480 --> 1:52:49.040]  hookers, men, women, children, you want to kill a kid, now you're really in the club.
[1:52:49.040 --> 1:52:50.040]  That's who they are.
[1:52:50.040 --> 1:52:51.040]  Charlie Rose was at the parties.
[1:52:51.040 --> 1:52:53.200]  Who do you think the Bilderberg group loved him?
[1:52:53.200 --> 1:52:55.720]  Why do they call the billionaires and royals he went on with him?
[1:52:55.720 --> 1:52:57.840]  They control the whole damn UK with pedophilia.
[1:52:57.840 --> 1:53:01.600]  It's been mainstream headlines that pedophilia is national security.
[1:53:01.600 --> 1:53:06.240]  It's their fricking religion.
[1:53:06.240 --> 1:53:08.560]  It's torturing children to death.
[1:53:08.560 --> 1:53:11.240]  Grow up and admit it, America, but let me tell you something.
[1:53:11.240 --> 1:53:16.400]  I went down to Google and was screaming at them yesterday, forgot about bullhorns, I
[1:53:16.400 --> 1:53:20.760]  just went full power without the bullhorn, and people would come up and say, hey man,
[1:53:20.760 --> 1:53:24.000]  I believe you, I work at Google, you're right, I don't care if they fire me, and they talk
[1:53:24.000 --> 1:53:27.400]  on camera a bunch of them, and I'd be like someone on the walkout looking at me and I'd
[1:53:27.400 --> 1:53:31.200]  say, oh, what are you covering up for them, and they'd say, hey, I got an open mind here.
[1:53:31.200 --> 1:53:35.080]  So I was taking, obviously, I know Google, most people are good at Google, it's compartmentalized,
[1:53:35.080 --> 1:53:39.400]  still, you're screaming at a building, and you got to get amped up to do it, but even,
[1:53:39.400 --> 1:53:43.280]  we're winning is what I'm saying, is that people are smiling because they were uncomfortable,
[1:53:43.280 --> 1:53:47.640]  I'm like, what are you smiling at, scumbag, well, no, I'm just smiling as I'm a big fan,
[1:53:47.640 --> 1:53:50.320]  so I have to apologize to some folks, I was crazed out there, you got to get like that
[1:53:50.320 --> 1:53:54.040]  to get in this mode, but I mean, we're winning, brother, I was walking back in the truck,
[1:53:54.040 --> 1:53:57.920]  people were like, you're right, Epstein, man, they killed it, the whole new order of pedophiles,
[1:53:57.920 --> 1:54:02.640]  black dudes, white dudes, old women, you know, French, Canadian, old guys, old Chinese women,
[1:54:02.640 --> 1:54:07.080]  young Chinese women, you know, and I'm not trying to say this like to make my wife jealous,
[1:54:07.080 --> 1:54:11.800]  it's just that it's not, it was like an Elvis Presley thing with the women, women were stopping
[1:54:11.800 --> 1:54:16.320]  cars getting out, grabbing on me, and because women like Mavericks, like people that are
[1:54:16.320 --> 1:54:20.640]  resisting, so I'm not bragging about me, I'm talking about as a censor of a bellwether,
[1:54:20.640 --> 1:54:24.920]  I've never been feeling so much love as I'm screaming at people, and they're like, no,
[1:54:24.920 --> 1:54:28.600]  no, we know you're right, so people are really waking up, the tipping points here on things
[1:54:28.600 --> 1:54:29.600]  like Epstein.
[1:54:29.600 --> 1:54:34.480]  Epstein exposed the scale and the scope of the degree to which people in power will resort
[1:54:34.480 --> 1:54:38.480]  to extraordinary methods and mechanisms to exercise that power.
[1:54:38.480 --> 1:54:43.440]  When I was representing victims of abuse, domestic abuse, all forms of abuse, the common pattern
[1:54:43.440 --> 1:54:47.520]  in child abuse were people who wanted power over children, children were the most innocent,
[1:54:47.520 --> 1:54:48.520]  the most vulnerable.
[1:54:48.520 --> 1:54:51.920]  Just tell me what you said last night, the profile of a federal judge is, that's what
[1:54:51.920 --> 1:54:52.920]  you do is profile people.
[1:54:52.920 --> 1:54:57.920]  Oh, we profile them all, so what you see is the people who seek power, the people who,
[1:54:57.920 --> 1:55:01.840]  for example, there's a reason why disproportionate number of people connected to children activities,
[1:55:01.840 --> 1:55:05.600]  whether it be high school teachers, whether it be priests, whether it be other people,
[1:55:05.600 --> 1:55:08.840]  to have a disproportionate number of people who abuse children in them.
[1:55:08.840 --> 1:55:11.960]  And some of the best people get into it, is just that there's a statistic that there's
[1:55:11.960 --> 1:55:13.720]  a large component of the worst.
[1:55:13.720 --> 1:55:14.720]  Correct, exactly.
[1:55:14.720 --> 1:55:15.720]  And you've got to be watching.
[1:55:15.720 --> 1:55:19.720]  You can have 90 to 95% be great, but you're going to have a disproportionate number that
[1:55:19.720 --> 1:55:25.440]  are not, in terms of, and that number may be 5%, 7%, 8%, because they are seeking power.
[1:55:25.440 --> 1:55:27.360]  That's their common modus operandi.
[1:55:27.360 --> 1:55:29.520]  But it doesn't mean the power to have a big house or even money.
[1:55:29.520 --> 1:55:33.080]  Like you said, judges will take federal ones a lot less money than they can make us a lawyer,
[1:55:33.080 --> 1:55:35.240]  but they want that raw rubbing it in.
[1:55:35.240 --> 1:55:38.920]  Well, there's federal judges who've commented on the very limited way in which they will
[1:55:38.920 --> 1:55:43.000]  pick federal judges, that in essence, they will not pick federal judges, they come from
[1:55:43.000 --> 1:55:47.240]  defense backgrounds, criminal defense backgrounds, civil rights backgrounds, that overwhelmingly
[1:55:47.240 --> 1:55:50.680]  they pick them, they come from corporate power, prosecutorial power backgrounds.
[1:55:50.680 --> 1:55:54.680]  And the risk is that you get judges who are driven more by power than principle.
[1:55:54.680 --> 1:55:57.560]  But it's a, it's a problem in our political promoting process.
[1:55:57.560 --> 1:55:59.720]  And they don't get principles the real power.
[1:55:59.720 --> 1:56:00.720]  Exactly.
[1:56:00.720 --> 1:56:04.280]  What they, what the power should be is the opportunity to make sure core principles get
[1:56:04.280 --> 1:56:05.280]  to empower humanity.
[1:56:05.280 --> 1:56:06.280]  Exactly.
[1:56:06.280 --> 1:56:07.280]  And empower others.
[1:56:07.280 --> 1:56:12.320]  Unfortunately, the nature of a, it's the anarchist argument in general about the state,
[1:56:12.320 --> 1:56:16.320]  that the state will naturally attract the worst group of people that are power seekers.
[1:56:16.320 --> 1:56:22.000]  And as why do you find child abuse disproportionate in power seeking societies and subsectors
[1:56:22.000 --> 1:56:26.760]  of society, it's because the same thing that drove them to seek power in the first place
[1:56:26.760 --> 1:56:27.760]  drives them to.
[1:56:27.760 --> 1:56:30.920]  And they want the power to do the taboo thing to them as a child.
[1:56:30.920 --> 1:56:32.520]  It's their religion.
[1:56:32.520 --> 1:56:33.520]  And they are the enemy.
[1:56:33.520 --> 1:56:34.520]  We're going to go to break.
[1:56:34.520 --> 1:56:36.840]  A few more minutes with Robert Barnes, I'm going to give the number out, cover all the
[1:56:36.840 --> 1:56:37.840]  other news.
[1:56:37.840 --> 1:56:38.840]  I haven't even scratched the surface yet.
[1:56:38.840 --> 1:56:39.840]  It is insane.
[1:56:39.840 --> 1:56:45.800]  And more is breaking all the time at infowars.com and newswars.com and sites like Bandot video
[1:56:45.800 --> 1:56:50.080]  that's exploding up the rankings, we're reaching massive numbers of people, whether it's growing
[1:56:50.080 --> 1:56:54.240]  exponentially, logarithmically, tell everyone the truth that they don't want you to know
[1:56:54.240 --> 1:56:58.920]  about Epstein and from the guy that first broke it, that it's the truth, anarchist people
[1:56:58.920 --> 1:56:59.920]  to open it up.
[1:56:59.920 --> 1:57:04.520]  Is it band.video, tweet it, Facebook it, share it by hand and know that we're this close
[1:57:04.520 --> 1:57:06.320]  to bringing down the pedophile armies.
[1:57:06.320 --> 1:57:08.080]  These Satanists are so scared.
[1:57:08.080 --> 1:57:09.280]  Everybody else wants to grovel to them.
[1:57:09.280 --> 1:57:10.280]  They can't stand it.
[1:57:10.280 --> 1:57:14.880]  But the spirit of resistance lives here where we are just ready to bang heads, full power,
[1:57:14.880 --> 1:57:16.440]  the name of Jesus Christ.

[2:00:04.720 --> 2:00:08.760]  to be here, ladies and gentlemen, I want to air this special report and Barnes is going
[2:00:08.760 --> 2:00:12.760]  to be back, I'm going to give the number out on the world advance on the betrayal of Trump
[2:00:12.760 --> 2:00:22.320]  by Bolton and so much more, they're now moving as well against Pence, as we said they would,
[2:00:22.320 --> 2:00:28.320]  it's all coming up in this third hour, here is a report on Hillary, but dabbling the dims.
[2:00:28.320 --> 2:00:39.320]  Hillary Clinton is going down, Hillary Clinton is a Chinese communist vegan and a criminal
[2:00:39.320 --> 2:00:43.320]  communist.
[2:00:43.320 --> 2:00:48.080]  Now Hillary Clinton obviously is basically running for president, she least wants the
[2:00:48.080 --> 2:00:52.200]  money and she's going around still raising money for her foundation, she's doing more
[2:00:52.200 --> 2:00:56.720]  campaign stops than all the other candidates pretty much combined, she's on more television
[2:00:56.720 --> 2:01:02.640]  than even Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and of course, Joe Biden combined.
[2:01:02.640 --> 2:01:15.520]  How did you kill Jeffrey Epstein, because you're not in power, but you have all the power.
[2:01:15.520 --> 2:01:22.400]  She's on everything and there's new big national polls out where she's in a dead heat with
[2:01:22.400 --> 2:01:27.640]  Joe Biden, who is the presumptive nominee, so you heard it here first folks that she
[2:01:27.640 --> 2:01:32.760]  would not run officially, but be running the whole time so that she won't be under scrutiny
[2:01:32.760 --> 2:01:38.680]  and then boom last minute, if she's able to remove Trump with impeachment, then she
[2:01:38.680 --> 2:01:42.800]  comes in and flexes her deep state muscles, she thinks that'll scare everybody else into
[2:01:42.800 --> 2:01:48.560]  submission and that they will run some weak Republican against her and she will get into
[2:01:48.560 --> 2:01:53.280]  office, why after all it was promised to her, she had eight years of co-presidency with
[2:01:53.280 --> 2:02:00.800]  Bill Clinton, the eight years of co-presidency with Barack Hussein Obama and I guess for
[2:02:00.800 --> 2:02:07.640]  her 16 years is not enough, so she's got those visions of the anointed she wants back in
[2:02:07.640 --> 2:02:13.280]  and she's still got that whole deep state in there, most of the neocons are on her side
[2:02:13.280 --> 2:02:17.640]  as well put in by the Bushes and so that's why she's so confident, she's got the mainstream
[2:02:17.640 --> 2:02:21.400]  media, she's got the Chai comms, she's got the Hollywood Americanators.
[2:02:21.400 --> 2:02:26.760]  We have this extraordinary charge by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton that one
[2:02:26.760 --> 2:02:33.520]  of the 2020 candidates who was later confirmed she meant Tulsi Gabbard was somehow working
[2:02:33.520 --> 2:02:36.200]  for Russia, why did she say that?
[2:02:36.200 --> 2:02:41.120]  You know it is often hard to know exactly what the Clintons are up to and how they're
[2:02:41.120 --> 2:02:46.560]  thinking about things, what may be true though is that she is worried about something happening
[2:02:46.560 --> 2:02:51.520]  to the Democratic nominee that she feels happened to her in 2016 and she is willing
[2:02:51.520 --> 2:02:55.320]  to sacrifice herself to raise these questions very early.
[2:02:55.320 --> 2:02:59.720]  She doesn't have you, she doesn't have the heart and soul of America, she doesn't have
[2:02:59.720 --> 2:03:06.040]  Christ on her side and she doesn't have the infill war on her side either.
[2:03:06.040 --> 2:03:10.400]  But they're all weak, Joe Biden can barely talk, gaffes every hour, every time he talks
[2:03:10.400 --> 2:03:12.800]  he says he wants the Paris Peace Accords passed.
[2:03:12.800 --> 2:03:17.800]  I'm gonna make sure that we rejoin the Paris Peace Accord on day one and I'm gonna announce
[2:03:17.800 --> 2:03:23.600]  within the first 100 days those 173 nations are gonna come and meet in Washington D.C.
[2:03:23.600 --> 2:03:27.840]  That happened to end the Vietnam War, it has nothing to do with us now, he doesn't know
[2:03:27.840 --> 2:03:33.560]  what state he's in, he says he's in Iowa when he's in Ohio, he's on another planet.
[2:03:33.560 --> 2:03:36.920]  Watch what happened when those kids from Parkland came up to see me and I was Vice President
[2:03:36.920 --> 2:03:39.800]  and they went under the, and some of you covered it.
[2:03:39.800 --> 2:03:44.720]  The issue with that statement is Joe Biden had moved out of the Naval Observatory more
[2:03:44.720 --> 2:03:48.400]  than a year before the mass murder at Parkland.
[2:03:48.400 --> 2:03:54.560]  Your father was never considered smart, he was never considered a good senator, he was
[2:03:54.560 --> 2:04:03.480]  only a good Vice President because he understood how to kiss Barack Obama's ass.
[2:04:03.480 --> 2:04:11.640]  All right, if you're receiving this transmission, you're the resistance, I want to take calls
[2:04:11.640 --> 2:04:14.240]  and I'm dedicated to taking more calls, we're gonna take a lot of calls tomorrow, we're
[2:04:14.240 --> 2:04:16.240]  gonna take them today as well.
[2:04:16.240 --> 2:04:20.000]  We got another great guest host coming up, Matt Bracken, I may comment there a little
[2:04:20.000 --> 2:04:23.360]  bit of time there to take more of those calls, we had the first 15 minutes but Matt's really
[2:04:23.360 --> 2:04:28.360]  gonna have a lot to cover, I always enjoy having my lunch a little late on those days
[2:04:28.360 --> 2:04:34.320]  and watching when Matt is sitting in, we're in the fourth hour and then no destroyer,
[2:04:34.320 --> 2:04:40.240]  and of course, got firepower coming up but I'm gonna hit, all the news we haven't covered
[2:04:40.240 --> 2:04:44.560]  basically as best I can, we come back and give the number out, all I can say to the
[2:04:44.560 --> 2:04:54.400]  globalist is your plan is going down, nine, no, shall not pass, no, no.

[2:05:02.040 --> 2:05:05.920]  financial support is what makes this possible, plus we make it easy.
[2:05:05.920 --> 2:05:10.840]  We have really great products at infowarestore.com and we have the Alexa Pure Breeze that every

[2:05:30.320 --> 2:05:36.000]  other competing brands are $400, $500, $600, $700, all the markup, no ladies and gentlemen
[2:05:36.000 --> 2:05:42.120]  we usually sell these all day long for $250, they're a great deal, 147, I almost, I told
[2:05:42.120 --> 2:05:45.520]  the guy like this cuts into the market so I'm just slow, people don't appreciate it,
[2:05:45.520 --> 2:05:49.760]  well this is what the infoware audience gets, infowarestore.com, there's only a few hundred
[2:05:49.760 --> 2:05:56.760]  of these left at this price and then more to come in until next year.
[2:06:19.760 --> 2:06:26.760]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance,
[2:06:26.760 --> 2:06:54.760]  you're listening to Alex Jones, let's go to Donna Brazil, the debates for CNN criminally
[2:06:54.760 --> 2:06:59.760]  fixed polls on record and WikiLeaks, he confirms it, the Fox News commentator telling us don't
[2:06:59.760 --> 2:07:05.240]  listen to the guy lost by a few thousand votes in Kentucky with all the massive evidence
[2:07:05.240 --> 2:07:09.520]  of the Democrats engaging in fraud, nationwide saying travel there to vote the names of dead
[2:07:09.520 --> 2:07:14.880]  people on the rolls, no it's a conspiracy theory, no the Democrats, they're going to
[2:07:14.880 --> 2:07:19.360]  win, yeah we let them steal the election, here she is on Fox, hell with Fox who needs
[2:07:19.360 --> 2:07:21.240]  MSNBC these days.
[2:07:21.240 --> 2:07:25.680]  Donna Brazil, former DNC interim chair and a Fox News contributor, Donna good morning
[2:07:25.680 --> 2:07:29.640]  to you, first your response to that this morning?
[2:07:29.640 --> 2:07:36.640]  Well I agree with the chairwoman, the Republicans did hold on and flip two of the seats, statewide
[2:07:36.640 --> 2:07:44.120]  seats, the fact is that Mr. Bevin is not a very popular governor and I think the voters
[2:07:44.120 --> 2:07:49.480]  wanted a change in that position and let's see what happens with the canvasson which
[2:07:49.480 --> 2:07:55.480]  is going to be underway in about seven days, they will canvass all 120 counties and if
[2:07:55.480 --> 2:08:00.320]  there are any irregularities, any problems, I'm sure the county clerks and others will
[2:08:00.320 --> 2:08:01.320]  find out.
[2:08:01.320 --> 2:08:06.520]  Okay here is Bevin on him on that very issue, he's making the case on the recount.
[2:08:06.520 --> 2:08:13.480]  We want the people of Kentucky to have absolute confidence that their votes were counted as
[2:08:13.480 --> 2:08:17.680]  they should have been counted, that the law was followed and that regardless of whether
[2:08:17.680 --> 2:08:23.040]  they vote this side of the aisle or that side of the aisle, that they can always have confidence
[2:08:23.040 --> 2:08:24.920]  that the electoral process works.
[2:08:24.920 --> 2:08:29.280]  So let's see whether or not Bevin wins on his challenge or not, but I think Kentucky
[2:08:29.280 --> 2:08:34.200]  is a little more complicated than most have analyzed thus far and that goes along the
[2:08:34.200 --> 2:08:38.520]  following lines, these northern counties in northern Kentucky that are the suburbs of
[2:08:38.520 --> 2:08:43.480]  Cincinnati, the Democrat Bashir won those counties, flipped them from Bevin, but if
[2:08:43.480 --> 2:08:48.160]  you look at the undercard, the other five statewide candidates, they pretty much romped
[2:08:48.160 --> 2:08:51.760]  across the board, defeating Democrats.
[2:08:51.760 --> 2:08:56.640]  So you have to go a little deeper to really understand it.
[2:08:56.640 --> 2:09:00.600]  Yeah and I think if you go a little deeper you'll scratch what's underneath the bottom
[2:09:00.600 --> 2:09:06.720]  and that is Mr. Bashir won counties, typical Democratic counties from the past, he won
[2:09:06.720 --> 2:09:11.160]  a lot of the eastern counties, counties that used to vote Democratic.
[2:09:11.160 --> 2:09:13.680]  I can't listen to any of this anymore.
[2:09:13.680 --> 2:09:19.120]  The Democrats are caught all over the country busing, they always say illegals, but they'll
[2:09:19.120 --> 2:09:23.920]  just bus anybody, the homeless people, you name it, to vote on up to 10 people on average.
[2:09:23.920 --> 2:09:27.720]  We've had Larry Nichols used to help the Clintons get into office, talked about it.
[2:09:27.720 --> 2:09:33.480]  And this is a reality, of course, if he barely lost, it was stolen, the Democrats rule voter
[2:09:33.480 --> 2:09:34.480]  fraud.
[2:09:34.480 --> 2:09:39.000]  Well, in fact, what's been publicly reported is that that's what Bill Clinton thought when
[2:09:39.000 --> 2:09:42.440]  Barack Obama beat Hillary Clinton in Iowa in 2008.
[2:09:42.440 --> 2:09:46.640]  Bill Clinton believed, without doubt, according to various published reports, including books
[2:09:46.640 --> 2:09:51.200]  published by liberal media members, that Obama had bused people in to steal the vote.
[2:09:51.200 --> 2:09:54.560]  So why would Clinton think that if this never occurs?
[2:09:54.560 --> 2:09:56.600]  Yeah, he just stole a trick from them.
[2:09:56.600 --> 2:09:57.600]  Yeah, exactly.
[2:09:57.600 --> 2:10:01.440]  I mean, why would Clinton think any, one of the first things I learned as a kid, old
[2:10:01.440 --> 2:10:06.480]  Grundy County, Tennessee Democratic poll told me, I was trying to figure out how they magically
[2:10:06.480 --> 2:10:09.800]  hit certain numbers, I was like, how did you get like that number when you needed that
[2:10:09.800 --> 2:10:10.800]  exact number of votes?
[2:10:10.800 --> 2:10:11.800]  And I was a teenager.
[2:10:11.800 --> 2:10:16.760]  And he said, well, Bobby, it's not who votes who count, it's who counts the vote to count.
[2:10:16.760 --> 2:10:19.400]  And I was, you know, it was a wise old Democratic hand.
[2:10:19.400 --> 2:10:21.040]  LBJ learned that here in Texas.
[2:10:21.040 --> 2:10:22.400]  Stuff from that Box 13.
[2:10:22.400 --> 2:10:23.400]  Exactly.
[2:10:23.400 --> 2:10:24.400]  Just waiting for that.
[2:10:24.400 --> 2:10:26.400]  Even posed with photos, having to rub it in.
[2:10:26.400 --> 2:10:27.400]  Oh, yeah.
[2:10:27.400 --> 2:10:28.880]  I'll give Lyndon Johnson credit.
[2:10:28.880 --> 2:10:29.880]  I mean, he was who he was.
[2:10:29.880 --> 2:10:33.040]  I was a little buddy of mine, Nick Dama, at Yale, grew up homeless on the streets of New
[2:10:33.040 --> 2:10:38.480]  York City, who you who said he always liked LBJ because LBJ was honest about his corruption.
[2:10:38.480 --> 2:10:41.320]  He said, you need you need a few more honest crooks in office.
[2:10:41.320 --> 2:10:43.200]  So there was that kind of sort of mindset.
[2:10:43.200 --> 2:10:46.760]  But there's no question that there are issues with turnout issues.
[2:10:46.760 --> 2:10:48.240]  There's issues with discrepancy.
[2:10:48.240 --> 2:10:53.800]  The problem for the Kentucky governor and his recount effort is that Republicans swept
[2:10:53.800 --> 2:10:55.600]  the lower offices.
[2:10:55.600 --> 2:10:58.720]  Republicans won the first African-American governor, Attorney General of the state of
[2:10:58.720 --> 2:11:01.240]  Kentucky is going to be a Republican.
[2:11:01.240 --> 2:11:06.000]  The Democratic governor who used his attorney general position and weaponized it against
[2:11:06.000 --> 2:11:10.120]  the incumbent governor to win the governor's seat is now going to regret that because.
[2:11:10.120 --> 2:11:11.120]  What about Virginia?
[2:11:11.120 --> 2:11:14.120]  I mean, that that's been 30 years since that went to a Democrat.
[2:11:14.120 --> 2:11:16.280]  The thing now that's an immigration driven issue.
[2:11:16.280 --> 2:11:17.760]  State card visa issues.
[2:11:17.760 --> 2:11:22.920]  But you have a disproportionate number of visa card holders who become Virginia citizens
[2:11:22.920 --> 2:11:23.920]  over.
[2:11:23.920 --> 2:11:25.880]  So that's changed the demographics of Virginia.
[2:11:25.880 --> 2:11:28.440]  The other thing is that I mean, Virginia is where the deep state lives.
[2:11:28.440 --> 2:11:32.520]  I'm going to say where they go from the only other places in Texas that's had a boom and
[2:11:32.520 --> 2:11:34.240]  you've had Californians moving there and other.
[2:11:34.240 --> 2:11:37.760]  So it's yeah, leftist have moved there like carrying crows and they've been killing manufacturing
[2:11:37.760 --> 2:11:43.000]  in that state, which was a key basis of populist conservative support, killing, mining in that
[2:11:43.000 --> 2:11:46.720]  state, which was another key basis of which is the plan to kill all opportunity than you
[2:11:46.720 --> 2:11:50.480]  need to live on the government top top and then you have people who are saying climate
[2:11:50.480 --> 2:11:54.240]  change is going to require just killing mass groups of people in general.
[2:11:54.240 --> 2:11:56.360]  So that's our next story.
[2:11:56.360 --> 2:11:57.560]  I haven't gotten to that.
[2:11:57.560 --> 2:11:59.400]  I should have.
[2:11:59.400 --> 2:12:01.760]  Let's cover that next segment and we'll let you get back to the important work you're
[2:12:01.760 --> 2:12:02.760]  doing.
[2:12:02.760 --> 2:12:06.360]  I'm going to give the number out, ladies and gentlemen, on any subject you want to cover
[2:12:06.360 --> 2:12:11.240]  on the big story here that I want to get Robert Barnes take on and that's what's happening
[2:12:11.240 --> 2:12:17.280]  with at the impeachment on the elections on the huge Epstein news coming out on the Roger
[2:12:17.280 --> 2:12:22.200]  Stone show trial and others saying I'm death threading the jurors because I had a grim
[2:12:22.200 --> 2:12:23.760]  reaper on here about Jeffrey Epstein.
[2:12:23.760 --> 2:12:25.960]  I mean, I know this is a complete fabrication.
[2:12:25.960 --> 2:12:27.720]  They knew it was a fabrication.
[2:12:27.720 --> 2:12:29.880]  They lied and if they don't retract, they're going to get sued.
[2:12:29.880 --> 2:12:34.200]  The days of sitting back and taking it routinely and repeatedly are over.
[2:12:34.200 --> 2:12:36.200]  What did they think was going to come out?
[2:12:36.200 --> 2:12:40.280]  Just deflect the story because the judge is trying to put on the jury Obama officials
[2:12:40.280 --> 2:12:43.880]  through and so we cover it, which is normal and they go, that's illegal and he's starting
[2:12:43.880 --> 2:12:45.600]  to kill us.
[2:12:45.600 --> 2:12:46.600]  Three things.
[2:12:46.600 --> 2:12:50.880]  First to further bias the judge against Roger Stone by creating these fake news stories.
[2:12:50.880 --> 2:12:55.920]  Second to potentially bias the jury themselves by having the jury say, oh, the people that
[2:12:55.920 --> 2:12:59.240]  are threatening you out there that if you don't, you know, and when in fact, they're
[2:12:59.240 --> 2:13:04.400]  sending the grim reaper, in fact, salmon moose by circulating those stories where the jury
[2:13:04.400 --> 2:13:07.880]  could read it really, it becomes a threat to the jury by them.
[2:13:07.880 --> 2:13:11.200]  And then the third is to discourage people from exercising their legal rights to look
[2:13:11.200 --> 2:13:14.720]  into whether this has been a fair jury selection process.
[2:13:14.720 --> 2:13:15.720]  That's the main goal.
[2:13:15.720 --> 2:13:20.480]  The primary goal is to prevent free press, prevent free speech, prevent people from knowing
[2:13:20.480 --> 2:13:21.480]  about their legal rights.
[2:13:21.480 --> 2:13:25.560]  It's my problem with all of the not only the weaponization of the law for political purposes,
[2:13:25.560 --> 2:13:29.200]  but also the members of the media and the legal left lying about it, making up things
[2:13:29.200 --> 2:13:32.040]  about the emolument clause, the U.S. Constitution that don't exist.
[2:13:32.040 --> 2:13:35.840]  Also, I've seen the code and I've read, I meant to get to that last week, it was pointed
[2:13:35.840 --> 2:13:37.080]  out by listeners.
[2:13:37.080 --> 2:13:40.880]  Quick pro quo is not illegal in foreign affairs.
[2:13:40.880 --> 2:13:45.880]  It's standard unless you're personally getting money or land or jewels.
[2:13:45.880 --> 2:13:49.640]  Of course you say the president's allowed to say to a foreign leader, okay, you take
[2:13:49.640 --> 2:13:52.160]  your missiles out of Cuba, take them out of Turkey.
[2:13:52.160 --> 2:13:54.160]  We had a treaty as you pointed out.
[2:13:54.160 --> 2:13:56.960]  There's a treaty with Ukraine about corruption.
[2:13:56.960 --> 2:13:57.960]  This is ridiculous.
[2:13:57.960 --> 2:14:01.920]  Well, I've been on a wide range of press and have challenged every leftist lawyer out there
[2:14:01.920 --> 2:14:06.200]  to name the criminal statute that's been violated by what they believe Trump did, and they can't
[2:14:06.200 --> 2:14:07.200]  identify it.
[2:14:07.200 --> 2:14:09.040]  And one of them said all extortion, it's like that's absurd.
[2:14:09.040 --> 2:14:10.720]  We're going to cover that in just a moment.
[2:14:10.720 --> 2:14:17.880]  The toll-free number to join us, ladies and gentlemen, today is 877-8789, Alex, 877-789-2539,
[2:14:17.880 --> 2:14:25.440]  is the number to join us, and we'll be taking your calls, but just briefly getting back
[2:14:25.440 --> 2:14:31.320]  into that, they don't care, though, if that's the law and the facts and the fraud and these
[2:14:31.320 --> 2:14:33.600]  fake whistleblowers that are proving frauds.
[2:14:33.600 --> 2:14:34.600]  They're just moving forward.
[2:14:34.600 --> 2:14:38.520]  Well, the left, increasingly, I saw it in law school when I was there, increasingly
[2:14:38.520 --> 2:14:41.160]  believes in just making our results-oriented.
[2:14:41.160 --> 2:14:42.160]  They no longer believe in the rules.
[2:14:42.160 --> 2:14:45.080]  They say we're the good guys so we can do all the evil things.
[2:14:45.080 --> 2:14:49.120]  They say the ends justify the means every time, and so it means that there's one rule
[2:14:49.120 --> 2:14:53.400]  of law for defamation for liberals, a different rule of law of defamation for conservatives,
[2:14:53.400 --> 2:14:57.000]  one rule of law that governs Obama's conduct, the different rule of law that governs Trump's
[2:14:57.000 --> 2:14:58.000]  conduct.
[2:14:58.000 --> 2:14:59.000]  It's got to end.
[2:14:59.000 --> 2:15:02.480]  Five senators can say Ukraine better do this, we're going to hold the money up.
[2:15:02.480 --> 2:15:03.480]  Trump doesn't even do that.
[2:15:03.480 --> 2:15:04.720]  He has to be burned at the stake.
[2:15:04.720 --> 2:15:05.720]  Exactly.
[2:15:05.720 --> 2:15:08.640]  I mean, just complete contradictory activities.
[2:15:08.640 --> 2:15:13.240]  For example, if there was a whistleblower out there attacking President Obama, every
[2:15:13.240 --> 2:15:16.840]  major media network would have already done smear and hit jobs of him and identified him
[2:15:16.840 --> 2:15:18.840]  to the whole world and had cameras outside his house.
[2:15:18.840 --> 2:15:19.840]  And they would have arrested him.
[2:15:19.840 --> 2:15:20.840]  That's what Obama did.
[2:15:20.840 --> 2:15:21.840]  I mean, this is CNN.
[2:15:21.840 --> 2:15:24.520]  Remember, hunted a meme maker, hunted down a grandma.
[2:15:24.520 --> 2:15:26.960]  I mean, these are the people that threatened to dox him.
[2:15:26.960 --> 2:15:27.960]  Here's how they're winning.
[2:15:27.960 --> 2:15:30.320]  They're changing the subject from what's really going on.
[2:15:30.320 --> 2:15:31.600]  They're stopping the Trump agenda.
[2:15:31.600 --> 2:15:32.840]  He can't trust anybody around him.
[2:15:32.840 --> 2:15:33.840]  They're all lying.
[2:15:33.840 --> 2:15:35.760]  They are sabotaging the Trump agenda.
[2:15:35.760 --> 2:15:36.760]  So we all basically complain.
[2:15:36.760 --> 2:15:37.760]  He didn't get everything done.
[2:15:37.760 --> 2:15:42.880]  Well, hell, could you get something done surrounded by an army of lying, blue blood
[2:15:42.880 --> 2:15:43.880]  scumbags?
[2:15:43.880 --> 2:15:46.840]  God, have most of them pedophiles?
[2:15:46.840 --> 2:15:50.400]  I mean, most of these people are screwing little kids, OK?
[2:15:50.400 --> 2:15:51.400]  That's just an icing.
[2:15:51.400 --> 2:15:52.400]  OK?
[2:15:52.400 --> 2:15:53.400]  It goes a lot worse.
[2:15:53.400 --> 2:15:55.400]  They're killing little kids.
[2:15:55.400 --> 2:15:59.320]  Finally, there's a way for you to get into the blockchain, the hottest financial sector
[2:15:59.320 --> 2:16:01.160]  without all the speculation.

[2:16:06.440 --> 2:16:10.720]  CNN programs broadcast on Fox Business News, blockchain data centers offer an equipment
[2:16:10.720 --> 2:16:15.200]  leasing program in the explosive digital asset marketplace inspired by entrepreneurs
[2:16:15.200 --> 2:16:17.360]  who sold picks and shovels during the gold rush.
[2:16:17.360 --> 2:16:21.320]  The money is in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital
[2:16:21.320 --> 2:16:24.160]  assets, not a security IPO or note.
[2:16:24.160 --> 2:16:29.160]  Blockchain data centers have a proven turnkey equipment sale leaseback program with a 27%
[2:16:29.160 --> 2:16:33.440]  annualized lease payment deposited into your bank account each month.

[2:16:48.880 --> 2:16:51.320]  Equipment offer poses a financial risk to owners consult with financial professionals
[2:16:51.320 --> 2:16:55.440]  before purchasing not an offer to buy or sell a security which requires an operating document.

[2:18:56.640 --> 2:18:58.680]  The Alex Jones Show.
[2:18:58.680 --> 2:19:04.080]  A few days ago, my 11-year-old daughter came to me and she had her digital textbook.
[2:19:04.080 --> 2:19:08.800]  She said, Dad, they're teaching us about the periodic table and I clicked on iodine and
[2:19:08.800 --> 2:19:13.840]  it says that 2 billion people have low IQs or mentally retarded on the planet Earth because
[2:19:13.840 --> 2:19:15.080]  they didn't get enough iodine.
[2:19:15.080 --> 2:19:18.720]  That's what you say all the time, but I've heard people say you're crazy and it's not
[2:19:18.720 --> 2:19:23.440]  true, but Dad, it's right here on the periodic table when I click it, saying exactly what
[2:19:23.440 --> 2:19:24.440]  you said.
[2:19:24.440 --> 2:19:29.080]  And I said, I know, honey, that's why I have you take the high-quality nutraceutical grade
[2:19:29.080 --> 2:19:33.920]  iodine is because it's why you're so vibrant, why you're so alive.
[2:19:33.920 --> 2:19:38.920]  It's one of the reasons that you're so much healthier and smarter than most of the kids
[2:19:38.920 --> 2:19:39.920]  you're age.
[2:19:39.920 --> 2:19:43.400]  And it just really blew her away to read it there for herself.
[2:19:43.400 --> 2:19:49.280]  And I know that 2 billion people, ladies and gentlemen, 2 billion are mentally retarded
[2:19:49.280 --> 2:19:52.440]  on the face of the Earth right now because of iodine deficiency.
[2:19:52.440 --> 2:20:03.080]  Research it and find out for yourself now.
[2:20:03.080 --> 2:20:31.080]  I can tell you what's going on, I've seen it, but you're not going to get what you
[2:20:31.080 --> 2:20:38.320]  want to get until the day I die.
[2:20:38.320 --> 2:20:42.400]  Well, son, you're not going to find Jesus in one of those establishment churches, and
[2:20:42.400 --> 2:20:45.640]  Jesus didn't want to tell you on the news.
[2:20:45.640 --> 2:20:49.440]  So I know you're out there seeking and that's good.
[2:20:49.440 --> 2:20:53.880]  We're told we shouldn't seek, but you seek long enough you're going to find to make sure
[2:20:53.880 --> 2:20:57.360]  you don't find the wrong thing.
[2:20:57.360 --> 2:21:00.320]  Our barns is our guess right in shotgun.
[2:21:00.320 --> 2:21:02.160]  I said, hey, buddy, been on since pretty much the start of the show.
[2:21:02.160 --> 2:21:03.160]  You want to take some time?
[2:21:03.160 --> 2:21:04.160]  Oh, I want to stay on.
[2:21:04.160 --> 2:21:05.160]  Well, good.
[2:21:05.160 --> 2:21:06.160]  I want him to stay on with us.
[2:21:06.160 --> 2:21:07.160]  We're going to take your phone call.
[2:21:07.160 --> 2:21:08.800]  Start near in a moment.
[2:21:08.800 --> 2:21:14.320]  Can Trump be indicted in the house and removed in the Senate?
[2:21:14.320 --> 2:21:19.360]  Bolton willing to defy White House attestified impeachment inquiry, the court clears the
[2:21:19.360 --> 2:21:21.440]  way, sources say.
[2:21:21.440 --> 2:21:28.800]  So a violation of the executive branch, I mean, that the judiciary doesn't want people
[2:21:28.800 --> 2:21:30.400]  to take their rights away.
[2:21:30.400 --> 2:21:31.400]  The legislative doesn't.
[2:21:31.400 --> 2:21:35.760]  Meanwhile, House to explore Pence's role in Ukraine controversy with the new testimony
[2:21:35.760 --> 2:21:38.720]  he's now part of the removal process.
[2:21:38.720 --> 2:21:40.080]  This is all very scripted.
[2:21:40.080 --> 2:21:41.920]  They've told us what they're going to do.
[2:21:41.920 --> 2:21:46.520]  The lawyer for the fake whistleblower said, we're going to set Trump up, insurance policy
[2:21:46.520 --> 2:21:47.520]  type stuff.
[2:21:47.520 --> 2:21:51.040]  I mean, they're telling us and the Republican leadership acts dumb about this.
[2:21:51.040 --> 2:21:53.960]  Well, I mean, I think what they're doing is they're testing to see whether or not the
[2:21:53.960 --> 2:21:57.480]  president's base will rally to his defense and to such a degree that the Republicans
[2:21:57.480 --> 2:22:00.760]  in the Senate feel they have no choice but to oppose him.
[2:22:00.760 --> 2:22:01.760]  Bingo.
[2:22:01.760 --> 2:22:04.960]  And if Republicans are listening to QAnon, we're going to win.
[2:22:04.960 --> 2:22:05.960]  Everything's fine.
[2:22:05.960 --> 2:22:08.160]  I'm not trying to bash whoever the nebulous Q is.
[2:22:08.160 --> 2:22:09.400]  I've been around 25 years.
[2:22:09.400 --> 2:22:10.480]  You know who I am?
[2:22:10.480 --> 2:22:11.800]  We deliver.
[2:22:11.800 --> 2:22:14.200]  All this stuff that everything's fine is how you lose.
[2:22:14.200 --> 2:22:15.200]  That's how Hillary lost.
[2:22:15.200 --> 2:22:16.200]  Okay.
[2:22:16.200 --> 2:22:21.560]  So I'm just telling you that we don't put pressure on the Republican establishment and
[2:22:21.560 --> 2:22:22.560]  others.
[2:22:22.560 --> 2:22:24.160]  They are putting their finger up to the wind.
[2:22:24.160 --> 2:22:25.560]  Oh, no doubt about it.
[2:22:25.560 --> 2:22:30.040]  They're constantly testing because what they remember is the Nixon example, whereby originally
[2:22:30.040 --> 2:22:32.400]  Republican and the Nixon base held with them.
[2:22:32.400 --> 2:22:36.560]  They finally got fractures in that base and as soon as they did, they forced them out.
[2:22:36.560 --> 2:22:40.120]  So the goal is just to seize their opportunity when the opportunity presents itself.
[2:22:40.120 --> 2:22:41.120]  And let's be clear.
[2:22:41.120 --> 2:22:42.960]  Trump has gotten rid of all the lobbyists.
[2:22:42.960 --> 2:22:46.240]  Now, people in and around the White House all become their own lobbyists now and some
[2:22:46.240 --> 2:22:47.640]  of the monies are million dollars a day.
[2:22:47.640 --> 2:22:50.360]  I mean, but Trump doesn't know and he's trying to stop it literally.
[2:22:50.360 --> 2:22:52.200]  The Republican class, a bunch of them are corrupt.
[2:22:52.200 --> 2:22:53.640]  They want that money back.
[2:22:53.640 --> 2:22:55.760]  So the knives are out for Trump.
[2:22:55.760 --> 2:22:57.040]  Well, there have been all the way through.
[2:22:57.040 --> 2:22:58.040]  I mean, there was effort.
[2:22:58.040 --> 2:23:02.200]  As soon as the president started making momentum, they started doing shenanigans with delegates
[2:23:02.200 --> 2:23:05.560]  and tried to seize delegates that he would, Trump would win a race like Louisiana and
[2:23:05.560 --> 2:23:07.880]  all of a sudden the delegates would break a different way.
[2:23:07.880 --> 2:23:09.720]  There was the whole Colorado scandal.
[2:23:09.720 --> 2:23:12.360]  So and that's all he brought people in in order to fix that.
[2:23:12.360 --> 2:23:13.360]  So then there was a threat.
[2:23:13.360 --> 2:23:15.360]  So the government put them in prison?
[2:23:15.360 --> 2:23:16.360]  That's what ultimately.
[2:23:16.360 --> 2:23:17.360]  Oh, you bring Manafort in to fix that.
[2:23:17.360 --> 2:23:18.360]  He goes to prison.
[2:23:18.360 --> 2:23:19.360]  Exactly.
[2:23:19.360 --> 2:23:20.360]  Stone gives you the strategy to win.
[2:23:20.360 --> 2:23:21.360]  You go to prison.
[2:23:21.360 --> 2:23:23.960]  If he helps rally the base, he will destroy him.
[2:23:23.960 --> 2:23:24.960]  Exactly.
[2:23:24.960 --> 2:23:25.960]  It's just one thing after the next, after the next.
[2:23:25.960 --> 2:23:30.400]  There have been constant targeting of anybody who was a critical aid or ally of the president,
[2:23:30.400 --> 2:23:32.400]  particularly those who were the most essential allies.
[2:23:32.400 --> 2:23:33.880]  He's got to come to Stone's aid.
[2:23:33.880 --> 2:23:35.280]  I mean, it's not a good signal.
[2:23:35.280 --> 2:23:36.600]  Stone had done a damn thing.
[2:23:36.600 --> 2:23:43.200]  No, this is a crime that he's being prosecuted with that if this fit the crime, almost everybody
[2:23:43.200 --> 2:23:46.120]  in Congress or the period before Congress could be prosecuted.
[2:23:46.120 --> 2:23:48.600]  So it's a ludicrous application.
[2:23:48.600 --> 2:23:51.280]  It's an overly broad politically motivated case.
[2:23:51.280 --> 2:23:52.280]  It was brought.
[2:23:52.280 --> 2:23:53.280]  Totally transparent.
[2:23:53.280 --> 2:23:55.440]  I mean, evident that that's what's taking place.
[2:23:55.440 --> 2:23:59.480]  And there's been no effort, in my view, to make it at least appear to be a fair trial.
[2:23:59.480 --> 2:24:01.240]  It appears to be an unfair trial.
[2:24:01.240 --> 2:24:04.600]  And at some point, the head of the executive branch, the elected head of the executive
[2:24:04.600 --> 2:24:09.480]  branch has to take action in governing the executive branch and correct its excesses
[2:24:09.480 --> 2:24:10.480]  and injustices.
[2:24:10.480 --> 2:24:12.800]  And that's what needs to happen.
[2:24:12.800 --> 2:24:15.040]  Obama did it for people who are convicted terrorists.
[2:24:15.040 --> 2:24:19.640]  I mean, Roger Stone is being charged because they didn't like his answer to a few questions.
[2:24:19.640 --> 2:24:25.600]  Clinton pardoned convicted cocaine dealers.
[2:24:25.600 --> 2:24:32.040]  And pardoned people who were involved in gun running and other activities.
[2:24:32.040 --> 2:24:35.560]  Also pardoned people like Mark Rich, who had a wide range of allegations.
[2:24:35.560 --> 2:24:36.560]  Missile cigarettes.
[2:24:36.560 --> 2:24:39.680]  I mean, whether he was violating Iranian sanctions, I mean, all kinds of issues with
[2:24:39.680 --> 2:24:40.680]  him.
[2:24:40.680 --> 2:24:42.640]  So it's just outrageous what they're doing.
[2:24:42.640 --> 2:24:43.640]  No doubt.
[2:24:43.640 --> 2:24:46.160]  I mean, it's excessive and outrageous, but it's meant to send a message to everyone.
[2:24:46.160 --> 2:24:50.840]  It's really not so much just punishing Stone or just punishing Manaford or just punishing
[2:24:50.840 --> 2:24:55.240]  you in the way they're weaponizing the legal system against people for political purposes
[2:24:55.240 --> 2:25:00.400]  or misleading people about their rights concerning a juror, secrecy, misreading, misinterpreting
[2:25:00.400 --> 2:25:04.920]  the law as it applies to WikiLeaks, misinterpreting and misapplying the law as it applies to
[2:25:04.920 --> 2:25:10.320]  someone like Snowden or Julian Assange, who weren't given the whistleblower protections
[2:25:10.320 --> 2:25:12.000]  they're demanding for this guy.
[2:25:12.000 --> 2:25:15.880]  Apparently, there is a story out today that Facebook is going to start banning people who
[2:25:15.880 --> 2:25:17.800]  even mentioned the fake whistleblower's name.
[2:25:17.800 --> 2:25:20.480]  I mean, so this isn't a huge effort at censorship.
[2:25:20.480 --> 2:25:24.880]  Oh, Facebook is obsessed with the power to ban words or terms.
[2:25:24.880 --> 2:25:32.800]  In fact, anybody talking about Epstein back on July 5th of this year, investigative journalist
[2:25:32.800 --> 2:25:37.760]  Leo Zagami, who were trying to get on the show from wherever he says Italy, the U.S.
[2:25:37.760 --> 2:25:43.040]  travels all over, they just found that he posted an article back then.
[2:25:43.040 --> 2:25:47.480]  And so somebody posted a link to it, they banned him for good for saying how long until
[2:25:47.480 --> 2:25:50.640]  Epstein is killed by the deep state.
[2:25:50.640 --> 2:25:51.640]  This is insane.
[2:25:51.640 --> 2:25:55.600]  I mean, it was obvious from day one, as soon as that happened, the probability that he
[2:25:55.600 --> 2:26:01.640]  committed suicide unassisted and unaided with it by anyone else was extraordinarily low.
[2:26:01.640 --> 2:26:05.280]  That facility had to say, I mean, I handle prison suicide cases, so I represent people
[2:26:05.280 --> 2:26:10.280]  who actually commit suicide and where the system has screwed up in some way in allowing
[2:26:10.280 --> 2:26:14.480]  that to happen by people who are mentally ill or institutionalized for mental illness-related
[2:26:14.480 --> 2:26:15.480]  ailments.
[2:26:15.480 --> 2:26:16.480]  And that should never happen.
[2:26:16.480 --> 2:26:17.640]  That facility had a perfect record.
[2:26:17.640 --> 2:26:19.320]  It was designed so you couldn't.
[2:26:19.320 --> 2:26:20.320]  Exactly.
[2:26:20.320 --> 2:26:21.840]  Everything about it had been like 30-plus years.
[2:26:21.840 --> 2:26:25.640]  But it wasn't two bones, it was three, it's two of the same.
[2:26:25.640 --> 2:26:26.640]  It's frontal.
[2:26:26.640 --> 2:26:27.640]  He fought.
[2:26:27.640 --> 2:26:33.160]  You literally have to make an acrobatic Cirque du Soleil kind of jump off the top bed to magically
[2:26:33.160 --> 2:26:35.160]  kill yourself in the way they're saying he did.
[2:26:35.160 --> 2:26:36.760]  It was like a one in a million.
[2:26:36.760 --> 2:26:38.680]  But the point is, he said they're coming to kill me.
[2:26:38.680 --> 2:26:39.920]  He begged for his life.
[2:26:39.920 --> 2:26:42.480]  They went breathe, breathe while they were killing him.
[2:26:42.480 --> 2:26:44.240]  That's been published in various places.
[2:26:44.240 --> 2:26:46.360]  He told his family they're coming to kill me.
[2:26:46.360 --> 2:26:47.920]  So why is it so big now?
[2:26:47.920 --> 2:26:48.920]  It's totally exploded.
[2:26:48.920 --> 2:26:53.640]  It was the closest thing to Fight Club where Tyler Durgan's walking around and everybody's
[2:26:53.640 --> 2:26:54.640]  like, hey, they're in on it.
[2:26:54.640 --> 2:26:56.520]  He doesn't know why because he's gone the other personality.
[2:26:56.520 --> 2:26:59.480]  I'm walking down the street and I was like, yeah, I've seen it killing me, right, Jones?
[2:26:59.480 --> 2:27:00.480]  I apologize, Jones, you're right.
[2:27:00.480 --> 2:27:04.280]  And people come up and say it on camera and they're like, yeah, oh, young, black, white.
[2:27:04.280 --> 2:27:05.280]  I was like, what the?
[2:27:05.280 --> 2:27:06.280]  It's like a movie.
[2:27:06.280 --> 2:27:08.880]  I mean, it's like crazy.
[2:27:08.880 --> 2:27:13.440]  Even liberal publications like The Week said that if you looked at the Fox News worldview,
[2:27:13.440 --> 2:27:18.600]  if you looked at the traditional liberal worldview, they could not forecast and explain Epstein.
[2:27:18.600 --> 2:27:21.440]  Whereas if people who had followed the Info Wars worldview, they understood it exactly.
[2:27:21.440 --> 2:27:25.240]  I remember watching the documentary called The Whistleblower about a real whistleblower
[2:27:25.240 --> 2:27:30.320]  about what was happening with defense contractors involved in sex trafficking in Europe.
[2:27:30.320 --> 2:27:32.600]  And watching it was like, how could this whistleblower be so naive?
[2:27:32.600 --> 2:27:35.520]  And I realized they just are used to watching establishment press.
[2:27:35.520 --> 2:27:36.520]  So they couldn't.
[2:27:36.520 --> 2:27:38.360]  Because they weren't covering up in persecutors.
[2:27:38.360 --> 2:27:39.360]  Of course.
[2:27:39.360 --> 2:27:40.560]  I was like, oh, I just go to people, though.
[2:27:40.560 --> 2:27:43.560]  And they load little kids on the airplanes and fly them out to Lord knows where.
[2:27:43.560 --> 2:27:46.360]  But I, if I tell the bosses, the bosses will do something about it.
[2:27:46.360 --> 2:27:49.440]  Turns out Epstein was buying little girls from that.
[2:27:49.440 --> 2:27:50.440]  There's all kinds as well.
[2:27:50.440 --> 2:27:54.280]  I mean, these people need to be brought to justice.
[2:27:54.280 --> 2:27:55.280]  I know that about.
[2:27:55.280 --> 2:27:57.480]  And there's a reason why it exists.
[2:27:57.480 --> 2:28:01.560]  It exists for people in positions of power who want to exercise the most extreme versions
[2:28:01.560 --> 2:28:02.560]  of that power.
[2:28:02.560 --> 2:28:06.440]  And these old sick demons, folks, like having kids chained up in the basement.
[2:28:06.440 --> 2:28:10.160]  They had a bad day, they just walk in there pulling knife out, just slit their throat.
[2:28:10.160 --> 2:28:12.120]  Go get me another kid.
[2:28:12.120 --> 2:28:15.120]  Is the most perverse distorted version of that psychopathology.
[2:28:15.120 --> 2:28:16.600]  Come here, you little bastard.
[2:28:16.600 --> 2:28:18.160]  Your mommy's never going to help you.
[2:28:18.160 --> 2:28:20.160]  Just slit that throat.
[2:28:20.160 --> 2:28:21.160]  Liberal.
[2:28:21.160 --> 2:28:22.160]  Liberal.
[2:28:22.160 --> 2:28:23.160]  Hillary loves you.
[2:28:23.160 --> 2:28:24.160]  Liberal.
[2:28:24.160 --> 2:28:29.960]  Then the whole nature of the psychology of power attracts those kind of people.
[2:28:29.960 --> 2:28:32.160]  And it's why that they have to be constantly monitored.
[2:28:32.160 --> 2:28:36.160]  Hey, but I say drink your fluoride, take your 5G and let them rape kids and slit their
[2:28:36.160 --> 2:28:37.160]  throats.
[2:28:37.160 --> 2:28:40.000]  Hail Satan, right liberals?
[2:28:40.000 --> 2:28:41.000]  Liberals would send it to me.
[2:28:41.000 --> 2:28:42.000]  Well, a few of them on the FU.
[2:28:42.000 --> 2:28:43.000]  I would get their face and go, you like the kids getting raped?
[2:28:43.000 --> 2:28:44.000]  You like them?
[2:28:44.000 --> 2:28:45.000]  No, you're right.
[2:28:45.000 --> 2:28:46.000]  Oh, it was a fire in the light.
[2:28:46.000 --> 2:28:47.000]  Say Hillary's bad.
[2:28:47.000 --> 2:28:48.000]  Say it.
[2:28:48.000 --> 2:28:49.000]  You're right.
[2:28:49.000 --> 2:28:50.000]  She's bad.
[2:28:50.000 --> 2:28:51.000]  I actually did that yesterday.
[2:28:51.000 --> 2:28:52.000]  We're going to defeat you scumbags.
[2:28:52.000 --> 2:28:53.000]  You're going to pay.
[2:28:53.000 --> 2:28:58.720]  We can all agree these are troubled times, right?

[2:29:56.680 --> 2:29:58.720]  The Alex Jones Show.
[2:29:58.720 --> 2:30:04.120]  A few days ago, my 11-year-old daughter came to me and she had her digital textbook.
[2:30:04.120 --> 2:30:08.840]  She said, Dad, they're teaching us about the periodic table and I clicked on iodine and
[2:30:08.840 --> 2:30:13.880]  it says that 2 billion people have low IQs or mentally retarded on the planet Earth because
[2:30:13.880 --> 2:30:15.120]  they didn't get enough iodine.
[2:30:15.120 --> 2:30:18.880]  That's what you say all the time, but I've heard people say you're crazy and it's not
[2:30:18.880 --> 2:30:23.480]  true, but Dad, it's right here on the periodic table when I click it saying exactly what
[2:30:23.480 --> 2:30:24.480]  you said.
[2:30:24.480 --> 2:30:29.160]  I said, I know, honey, that's why I have you take the high-quality, nutraceutical grade
[2:30:29.160 --> 2:30:34.000]  iodine is because it's why you're so vibrant, it's why you're so alive.
[2:30:34.000 --> 2:30:39.000]  It's one of the reasons that you're so much healthier and smarter than most of the kids
[2:30:39.000 --> 2:30:40.000]  you're age.
[2:30:40.000 --> 2:30:45.640]  And it just really blew her away to read it there for herself to know that 2 billion
[2:30:45.640 --> 2:30:50.040]  people, ladies and gentlemen, 2 billion are mentally retarded on the face of the Earth
[2:30:50.040 --> 2:30:52.520]  right now because of iodine deficiency.
[2:30:52.520 --> 2:30:57.000]  You shouldn't find out for yourself now, infowars.com.
[2:30:57.000 --> 2:30:59.160]  All of our bodies are different.
[2:30:59.160 --> 2:31:02.040]  All of our metabolic systems are diverse.
[2:31:02.040 --> 2:31:05.040]  Some of us are deficient in some things and not in others.
[2:31:05.040 --> 2:31:08.480]  There's a lot of factors that go into this and I'm not telling you something that you
[2:31:08.480 --> 2:31:11.840]  don't know, but I'm here to tell you.
[2:31:11.840 --> 2:31:19.480]  Every time I commit and use the supplements that we sell on a religious basis, my life
[2:31:19.480 --> 2:31:24.800]  completely changes, I'm healthier, I have more energy, I lose weight, I look better,
[2:31:24.800 --> 2:31:25.800]  everybody notices.
[2:31:25.800 --> 2:31:33.240]  Two months ago, I said on air, I am going to commit to take X2, body's ultimate turmeric.
[2:31:33.240 --> 2:31:38.440]  I'm going to commit to flush my gut out with the gut fusion from infowars life.
[2:31:38.440 --> 2:31:43.280]  And when I take these products, the results are nothing less than miraculous.
[2:31:43.280 --> 2:31:49.280]  Well, one product that's amazing that I use, I don't talk enough about is gut fusion, folks.
[2:31:49.280 --> 2:31:50.280]  Check it out.
[2:31:50.280 --> 2:31:51.280]  There's nothing else like it.

[2:31:56.760 --> 2:32:00.920]  The time has come to defy the thought police.
[2:32:00.920 --> 2:32:04.440]  They are banning hundreds and hundreds of symbols every year.
[2:32:04.440 --> 2:32:09.800]  They're waging war on communication itself as a Thabian socialist promise they would
[2:32:09.800 --> 2:32:13.960]  do more than 70 years ago from their command base in England.
[2:32:13.960 --> 2:32:20.360]  We've had Oxford come out and ban clapping, the ADL and others will literally bankrupt
[2:32:20.360 --> 2:32:24.120]  you, kick you out of college, destroy you, have you arrested in some areas.
[2:32:24.120 --> 2:32:30.120]  If you do the OK symbol, that's the international sign language symbol for OK, they know what
[2:32:30.120 --> 2:32:31.280]  they're doing.
[2:32:31.280 --> 2:32:34.400]  These people are authoritarians and they're dangerous.
[2:32:34.400 --> 2:32:38.640]  And the answer to their attack on speech is to exercise it in their face.
[2:32:38.640 --> 2:32:43.800]  We have a, it's OK to be OK, politically incorrect ball cap, it's black and white, very nice
[2:32:43.800 --> 2:32:45.400]  as the OK symbol on it.
[2:32:45.400 --> 2:32:49.280]  It's a great way to start conversations, infowars.com is on the back.

[2:32:59.480 --> 2:33:16.920]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:33:16.920 --> 2:33:29.560]  You keep saying you've got something for me, something you call love, but confess you've
[2:33:29.560 --> 2:33:35.320]  been a messin', you've been a messin' where you shouldn't have been a messin'.
[2:33:35.320 --> 2:33:42.840]  Our children and now someone else is gettin' all your best, our property, these boots on
[2:33:42.840 --> 2:33:51.280]  our guns, and that's just what they'll do, and one of these days, boots are gonna walk
[2:33:51.280 --> 2:33:52.280]  all over you.
[2:33:52.280 --> 2:34:00.280]  Doesn't matter how long you fight globalists, you're going in the woodchipper, politically.
[2:34:00.280 --> 2:34:04.320]  Just start walkin'.
[2:34:04.320 --> 2:34:07.920]  You keep lyin' when you oughta be truthin'.
[2:34:07.920 --> 2:34:10.040]  Oh, oughta be truthin', turn it up.
[2:34:10.040 --> 2:34:13.920]  Do you keep losin' when you oughta not bet?
[2:34:13.920 --> 2:34:15.920]  That's a good point.
[2:34:15.920 --> 2:34:19.560]  Do you keep sayin' it when you oughta be a changin'?
[2:34:19.560 --> 2:34:21.560]  You know, I just got a brand new box of matches.
[2:34:21.560 --> 2:34:25.360]  Now what's right is right, but you ain't been right yet.
[2:34:25.360 --> 2:34:28.800]  These boots don't age more.
[2:34:28.800 --> 2:34:33.040]  They got the power, they don't have the truth, and they're loosin' ground.
[2:34:33.040 --> 2:34:34.040]  That's...
[2:34:34.040 --> 2:34:37.640]  Trump's not invincible, but the truth is invincible.
[2:34:37.640 --> 2:34:42.200]  Oh, absolutely, and there's no doubt that a large part of the acts that have taken place
[2:34:42.200 --> 2:34:46.080]  are acts of desperation, a feeling of futility, a feeling of frustration, that they've been
[2:34:46.080 --> 2:34:51.600]  unable to change the president's mind, unable to get him to bend to their will, unable to
[2:34:51.600 --> 2:34:56.120]  get them to reverse his or prior positions, because everyone else who's got elected, even
[2:34:56.120 --> 2:35:01.440]  on populist positions, has mostly reversed those positions once they got to power.
[2:35:01.440 --> 2:35:05.480]  Remember Obama ran on how he's gonna change NAFTA, he's gonna change trade agreements,
[2:35:05.480 --> 2:35:08.240]  he wasn't gonna do those deals, and then as soon as he got there, that's exactly what
[2:35:08.240 --> 2:35:09.240]  he did.
[2:35:09.240 --> 2:35:10.240]  But Trump's actually been doing it.
[2:35:10.240 --> 2:35:11.240]  Exactly, and it drives them insane.
[2:35:11.240 --> 2:35:14.440]  And then they just want to wear people out of them, have others just think they're part
[2:35:14.440 --> 2:35:17.320]  of the power structure if they just join the attack on Trump.
[2:35:17.320 --> 2:35:18.320]  Exactly.
[2:35:18.320 --> 2:35:21.800]  I've had so many people holly, would you name me, well, Alex, just please don't support
[2:35:21.800 --> 2:35:22.800]  him.
[2:35:22.800 --> 2:35:23.800]  They're trying to...
[2:35:23.800 --> 2:35:29.200]  We'll stop, Sue, and he'll all stop, just give yourself to Lucifer.
[2:35:29.200 --> 2:35:33.080]  They try to create an impression of inevitability in order to create a sense of futility in
[2:35:33.080 --> 2:35:37.680]  Trump's base and audience, with the hope that that converts Republican senators into
[2:35:37.680 --> 2:35:40.200]  standing aside and letting them take up the president.
[2:35:40.200 --> 2:35:44.920]  And it's part of a consistent pattern, a consistent methodology, and they won't stop, and they'll
[2:35:44.920 --> 2:35:49.440]  continue to pursue it until 2020.
[2:35:49.440 --> 2:35:53.880]  And it's up to the ordinary person to stand up for the president that keeps the constitutional
[2:35:53.880 --> 2:35:55.160]  liberties afloat in this country.
[2:35:55.160 --> 2:35:56.160]  I agree.
[2:35:56.160 --> 2:35:57.160]  I want to go to Coles.
[2:35:57.160 --> 2:35:58.160]  I'm gonna host Coles for the next hour.
[2:35:58.160 --> 2:35:59.160]  He'll be here for the next two segments.
[2:35:59.160 --> 2:36:03.680]  I just want to throw this out there again.
[2:36:03.680 --> 2:36:05.480]  The equation is very simple.
[2:36:05.480 --> 2:36:09.760]  You fund the operation, we stay on air, we defeat the globalists.
[2:36:09.760 --> 2:36:17.080]  It's the easiest way you can put energy towards fighting the New World Order and all the terrible
[2:36:17.080 --> 2:36:21.480]  things it's doing and all the horrible plans it's got is funding this operation.
[2:36:21.480 --> 2:36:24.560]  And there's many different forms of energy in the universe.
[2:36:24.560 --> 2:36:29.760]  Your word of mouth, spreading the word, telling others, sharing articles, sharing videos on
[2:36:29.760 --> 2:36:35.240]  all the different platforms by text message, in person, over the radio, over TV, jumping
[2:36:35.240 --> 2:36:41.160]  in front of an outdoor live newscast, pulling a stunt, putting a URL on your barn, putting
[2:36:41.160 --> 2:36:45.680]  a bumper sticker on your car, that's all paramount.
[2:36:45.680 --> 2:36:51.800]  Then buying products that you know are good and that make your life better, that then
[2:36:51.800 --> 2:36:57.800]  fund the operation, that's also key and of course prayer is next level.
[2:36:57.800 --> 2:37:03.760]  We're ending the big sale, everything must go, super sale, 40, 70% off, got a whole list
[2:37:03.760 --> 2:37:05.840]  of the products that have sold out.
[2:37:05.840 --> 2:37:10.960]  A bunch of great things like DNA Force Plus have come back in, it's 50% off, free shipping
[2:37:10.960 --> 2:37:11.960]  as well.
[2:37:11.960 --> 2:37:16.760]  But we have to end the general special in the next few days because 20-something things
[2:37:16.760 --> 2:37:18.760]  have sold out.
[2:37:18.760 --> 2:37:22.100]  A whole bunch of items are on the verge of it, so I've already stopped selling the super
[2:37:22.100 --> 2:37:29.080]  blue fluoride free toothpaste, 50% off, we only make $2 on it when we do that and we
[2:37:29.080 --> 2:37:32.560]  won't get more until probably the New Year, it looks like late December New Year and it's
[2:37:32.560 --> 2:37:36.320]  our biggest total seller, it's not a big money maker but it's the thing we sell the
[2:37:36.320 --> 2:37:37.320]  most of.
[2:37:37.320 --> 2:37:41.520]  Now we've got it back at full price so that folks that are going to get it out to the
[2:37:41.520 --> 2:37:48.040]  New Year, they'll pay $12 or whatever instead of $7 and that funds us, there's no fillers,
[2:37:48.040 --> 2:37:54.160]  non-free, colloidal silver iodine, 4-5 but the bubblegum flavor is very popular but we
[2:37:54.160 --> 2:37:56.920]  sell 3-to-1 the non-children's.
[2:37:56.920 --> 2:38:01.080]  This is the same thing as an adult, it just has the natural bubblegum flavor for kids
[2:38:01.080 --> 2:38:03.920]  and they can actually swallow this and not have any problems because there's no fluoride
[2:38:03.920 --> 2:38:07.680]  and it's got the colloidal silver, the iodine, so it really is a nutraceutical and it's
[2:38:07.680 --> 2:38:12.720]  a concentrate so it's 50% off right now and I'm only explaining something, I could put
[2:38:12.720 --> 2:38:16.520]  a tube of this out with the filler with all the silicates and the rest of it because most
[2:38:16.520 --> 2:38:25.680]  of them are like 80% sand, small granular sand and I could put these out for like a
[2:38:25.680 --> 2:38:30.160]  dollar and a half tube instead of 3-something a tube but it's got all the great ingredients
[2:38:30.160 --> 2:38:34.600]  in it and we had to get one of the top firms in the country to add the iodine, the colloidal
[2:38:34.600 --> 2:38:40.120]  silver and all that so it's a lot goes into this and we're very, very proud of it and
[2:38:40.120 --> 2:38:46.400]  it's at 50% off right now so for your grandchildren or for whatever, a lot of adults like it.
[2:38:46.400 --> 2:38:50.920]  So, it's at InformerStore.com and I want to explain something, all of these had a 99%
[2:38:50.920 --> 2:38:56.600]  approval rating at InformerStore.com until they ran national things on Trevor Noah and
[2:38:56.600 --> 2:39:02.720]  on all those other big shows, demonizing and saying go vote it down, all the rest of it
[2:39:02.720 --> 2:39:06.920]  at power reviews, these are real reviews and so they pull a bunch of crap, try to vote
[2:39:06.920 --> 2:39:11.040]  them down thinking oh we hit that, I mean big national programs, who's the other guy
[2:39:11.040 --> 2:39:18.880]  that has a show on last week on the news, on HBO, the British guy or whatever, last
[2:39:18.880 --> 2:39:25.160]  week tonight yeah, all these shows, John Oliver, they all just demonize it, vice all of them,
[2:39:25.160 --> 2:39:29.960]  you know you say go vote it down and then they go vote it down, I mean that's how obsessed
[2:39:29.960 --> 2:39:34.520]  they are and it's all a lie but anyways it's an InformerStore, it's still at 89% despite
[2:39:34.520 --> 2:39:39.080]  you know it's been 99, this is what they're doing to try to take us off air, InformerStore.com
[2:39:39.080 --> 2:39:45.680]  get yours and it defies their criminal activities, the Alexa Pure Breezes, we got a couple thousand
[2:39:45.680 --> 2:39:49.640]  of those at cost at the end of the year, we have a contract, we're down to a few hundred
[2:39:49.640 --> 2:39:53.840]  right now, free shipping on those as well but just know your purchase makes it all possible,
[2:39:53.840 --> 2:39:59.200]  I thank you for the support, Barnes let's go to some phone calls, all right let's go
[2:39:59.200 --> 2:40:05.000]  ahead here and go to Carlos, his longtime callers, longtime, first time callers today,
[2:40:05.000 --> 2:40:08.080]  Carlos is always a smart cookie with some of the Epstein case, go ahead Carlos.
[2:40:08.080 --> 2:40:13.440]  Thank you Alex, well I have a lot on the Epstein case but I wanted to first share with you
[2:40:13.440 --> 2:40:21.400]  something that has gone under the radar for quite some time, the name is Ghislaine Maxwell
[2:40:21.400 --> 2:40:30.160]  and she appears in writing actually the day after that photograph at the In-N-Out hamburger
[2:40:30.160 --> 2:40:37.520]  joint in California and she is actually doing a customer review which is a coded message
[2:40:37.520 --> 2:40:44.920]  that appears on Amazon under the book title that she was reading in that picture, the book
[2:40:44.920 --> 2:40:52.520]  title is The Book of Honor by Ted Gupp, so if you go to the amazon.com website and look
[2:40:52.520 --> 2:40:59.960]  at the customer review for that book, The Book of Honor, you will find G Maxwell, a comforting
[2:40:59.960 --> 2:41:07.960]  read after a personal tragedy, yeah guys just type in Maxwell Epstein caught at In-N-Out
[2:41:07.960 --> 2:41:13.320]  burger California and you can see her reading a book about CIA intelligence agents murdered
[2:41:13.320 --> 2:41:20.160]  in the line of duty is the book, there it is, The Book of Honor, the secret lives and
[2:41:20.160 --> 2:41:24.920]  deaths of CIA operatives and then she did a review and I said at the time the book she
[2:41:24.920 --> 2:41:30.800]  was reading it was all obviously staged and Carl is a smart guy, I haven't read the review,
[2:41:30.800 --> 2:41:35.560]  what is she saying, it's undoubtedly not even a coded message, go ahead.
[2:41:35.560 --> 2:41:43.000]  Well it is coded because it's really to throw the CIA NSA FBI obviously CIA NSA FBI wouldn't
[2:41:43.000 --> 2:41:47.160]  touch her with a 10 foot pole, sure it's a threat that if you mess with me I'll expose
[2:41:47.160 --> 2:41:53.080]  everything like Barney Frank and others said, so it reads a good friend of mine died recently
[2:41:53.080 --> 2:41:58.840]  under a very tragic circumstances, some of us saw it coming for quite a while but it
[2:41:58.840 --> 2:42:04.640]  was still a huge shock when it finally happened, I picked up this book at the advice of a friend
[2:42:04.640 --> 2:42:11.160]  and absolutely could put it down, I read Walking the Dog, Getting Fast Food, Picture or even
[2:42:11.160 --> 2:42:16.800]  just lounging around the house, it helped me realize that my friend really believed
[2:42:16.800 --> 2:42:24.800]  in something and that giving your life for the CIA NSA FBI Mossad or any other intelligence
[2:42:24.800 --> 2:42:33.320]  agency it's truly a higher calling and not something to mourn a wholehearted recommendation.
[2:42:33.320 --> 2:42:40.600]  Now what people don't know is that Jeffrey Epstein actually was back a long time he goes
[2:42:40.600 --> 2:42:47.600]  back to Robert Maxwell who was in fact her father and like you know other people.
[2:42:47.600 --> 2:42:51.800]  Hold on stay there exactly it's the higher calling to kidnap the children in mass and
[2:42:51.800 --> 2:42:56.200]  do all these things to them and she's telling you the world she's very proud of her work.
[2:42:56.200 --> 2:43:03.160]  Serving with Info Wars is a great honor but I still need my morning coffee and luckily

[2:43:58.480 --> 2:44:03.680]  you have two different types of iodine well that's because different types of physiologies
[2:44:03.680 --> 2:44:09.560]  different types of metabolic systems and people will like different formulas it's just that
[2:44:09.560 --> 2:44:15.800]  simple x3 is the deep earth crystal iodine and two other types because some people need
[2:44:15.800 --> 2:44:22.120]  all three types to absorb others like the pure atomic iodine get both they're both great
[2:44:22.120 --> 2:44:27.560]  for you whichever one you like use that and give the other to family or friends bottom
[2:44:27.560 --> 2:44:33.000]  line iodine is essential that's why I harp on it the globalist want you to be deficient
[2:44:33.000 --> 2:44:39.000]  in it for a lot of reasons lower IQ makes you sluggish you don't live as long it's simple

[2:44:50.240 --> 2:44:58.880]  both types of iodine with selenium for 60% off together the time has come to defy the
[2:44:58.880 --> 2:45:04.880]  thought police they are banning hundreds and hundreds of symbols every year they're waging
[2:45:04.880 --> 2:45:11.040]  war on communication itself as the Fabian socialist promise they would do more than 70
[2:45:11.040 --> 2:45:17.520]  years ago from their command base in England we've had Oxford come out in band clapping
[2:45:17.520 --> 2:45:22.360]  the ADL and others will literally bankrupt you kick you out of college destroy you have
[2:45:22.360 --> 2:45:27.640]  you arrested in some areas if you do the OK symbol that's the international sign language
[2:45:27.640 --> 2:45:33.120]  symbol for OK they know what they're doing these people are authoritarian and they're

[2:47:18.200 --> 2:47:23.280]  to move to austin so he can be in the studio do his own show he needs to because I've been
[2:47:23.280 --> 2:47:27.840]  studying this whole episode thing for 13 14 years when I first saw his name 15 years ago
[2:47:27.840 --> 2:47:31.520]  we billow and the gates and Ted Turner and them running eugenics operation I saw the
[2:47:31.520 --> 2:47:35.760]  name and I went back and saw the articles but I've been watching since the whole first
[2:47:35.760 --> 2:47:41.360]  pito bus and that cover up and it's just amazing we get getting into Maxwell's father you were
[2:47:41.360 --> 2:47:45.200]  pointing out she's going to be alive right now kind of say what you don't repeat some
[2:47:45.200 --> 2:47:48.800]  what you said and we'll go back to Carl so I mean there have been stories that the published
[2:47:48.800 --> 2:47:53.360]  photo of her was not contemporaneously made and it may have been previously made and was
[2:47:53.360 --> 2:47:58.680]  sort of a dead man switch or a risk threat that she had the authorization to release
[2:47:58.680 --> 2:48:02.720]  it either way she hasn't talked to her interviewed with anyone that anyone has been able to document
[2:48:02.720 --> 2:48:09.080]  her detail on the record her father of course died under mysterious circumstances himself
[2:48:09.080 --> 2:48:14.120]  was connected to a wide range of political actors and there were wide ranging allegations
[2:48:14.120 --> 2:48:18.760]  or theories that he may have been murdered or hit himself there are wide ranging concerns
[2:48:18.760 --> 2:48:23.560]  of whether or not Jill St. Maxwell is alive what I do remember is I remember the southern
[2:48:23.560 --> 2:48:27.680]  district of New York making a big deal at the time of Epstein's death and saying don't
[2:48:27.680 --> 2:48:31.320]  worry we're going to bring a bunch of other indictments against people connected to him
[2:48:31.320 --> 2:48:37.040]  here we are months and months later and not a whisper of such indictments taking place
[2:48:37.040 --> 2:48:41.360]  so I mean there's already people who think the southern district of New York never meaningfully
[2:48:41.360 --> 2:48:45.480]  intended to go after those people and he was only brought in to kill him that's that's
[2:48:45.480 --> 2:48:50.040]  what some people think I mean they and the end those theories are going to be strengthened
[2:48:50.040 --> 2:48:53.600]  if the U.S. Attorney's Office takes no action against the other but according to the left's
[2:48:53.600 --> 2:48:58.880]  lawsuits against myself we're not supposed to ever question anything that's happened
[2:48:58.880 --> 2:49:02.880]  in a public event well increasingly some of the legal theories being pursued by the left
[2:49:02.880 --> 2:49:08.240]  in a wide range of cases including these cases but also other cases is where is there saying
[2:49:08.240 --> 2:49:13.920]  if you challenge or contest who committed a crime or who committed a mass trauma that
[2:49:13.920 --> 2:49:18.600]  you can be then sued by people who are related in any way shape or form when everyone's always
[2:49:18.600 --> 2:49:23.120]  questioned everything that's what juries do well you know the OJ case and I've looked
[2:49:23.120 --> 2:49:27.240]  at that I don't know who really did it most innocence project cases imagine if you couldn't
[2:49:27.240 --> 2:49:32.240]  challenge whether someone was innocent the or without being yeah that's right yeah exactly
[2:49:32.240 --> 2:49:36.520]  then didn't DNA is proven like what a third of more innocent tons of innocent project
[2:49:36.520 --> 2:49:39.960]  people have been proven to be innocent based on independent medical and scientific and
[2:49:39.960 --> 2:49:43.480]  forensic testing imagine if they couldn't say it without the person say hey you know
[2:49:43.480 --> 2:49:47.360]  I'm related to the victim of that crime I consider you intending to inflict emotional
[2:49:47.360 --> 2:49:52.920]  distress who's the famous case in north north of Austin I forget the guy's name where he
[2:49:52.920 --> 2:49:56.880]  never had a criminal record somebody comes in kills his daughter and then they convict
[2:49:56.880 --> 2:50:00.240]  him he spends decades on in death row and then the father guy that did it that much
[2:50:00.240 --> 2:50:05.120]  to it and then confirms actually the government knew had his blood had it all we have a long
[2:50:05.120 --> 2:50:09.120]  history of some Texas cases like that you have the great documentary the thin blue line
[2:50:09.120 --> 2:50:13.400]  where they accuse someone of being responsible for killing someone that it turned out totally
[2:50:13.400 --> 2:50:18.280]  innocent and the the documentary goes through the detail of how it was I mean you had prosecutors
[2:50:18.280 --> 2:50:22.960]  in parts of Texas back in the day who used to brag said any prosecutor can convict a
[2:50:22.960 --> 2:50:27.720]  guilty person it takes a truly extraordinary one to convict an innocent person so we're
[2:50:27.720 --> 2:50:32.240]  seeing aspects of it that the power in the hands of the wrong people will be misused
[2:50:32.240 --> 2:50:36.440]  and abused and there's aspects of that that are throughout the process and if we don't
[2:50:36.440 --> 2:50:45.640]  question sure who's the guy he had lawyers on about it was in round rock and his daughter
[2:50:45.640 --> 2:50:49.240]  got killed they blamed him and even though they knew it was this other guy and later
[2:50:49.240 --> 2:50:53.480]  that guy confessed and then all the evidence came out it's just unbelievable unbelievable
[2:50:53.480 --> 2:50:57.000]  when you learn all about it and it's like they just knew and just didn't just cover
[2:50:57.000 --> 2:51:00.840]  it up there's a whole range of them and John Grisham has a great book out called the innocent
[2:51:00.840 --> 2:51:04.920]  man about another guy is probably innocent is facing death row so it there's a lot of
[2:51:04.920 --> 2:51:08.400]  those kind of cases out there I'm for the death penalty except the system's so corrupt
[2:51:08.400 --> 2:51:11.600]  you can't trust it I want to go to phone calls Carlos finish up as you were saying from Canada
[2:51:11.600 --> 2:51:16.240]  sorry you were you're bringing up some great points the basic thing is that you remember
[2:51:16.240 --> 2:51:24.240]  Alex Acosta said that he was told not to touch or go easy on on Jeffrey Epstein because
[2:51:24.240 --> 2:51:29.480]  he was intelligent what was really not known at the time was that the police chief Michael
[2:51:29.480 --> 2:51:33.880]  writer and you should have him bomb beach police chief Michael writer has been writing
[2:51:33.880 --> 2:51:39.560]  about what happened to them they were at all turns they were being obstructed from being
[2:51:39.560 --> 2:51:46.280]  able to bring about the prosecution on 48 of over 40 of these these women young women
[2:51:46.280 --> 2:51:52.200]  actually children to in fact and the best way to see it Alex if we have one day a Saturday
[2:51:52.200 --> 2:51:57.480]  call in I'll give you all this story but the best way to see it is to look at this man
[2:51:57.480 --> 2:52:03.840]  Jeffrey Epstein as a sexual commando the little girls didn't have a chance this man was operating
[2:52:03.840 --> 2:52:09.640]  an intelligence operation and he was actually to the very end and think about it for a second
[2:52:09.640 --> 2:52:17.960]  why would the most con decorated most known political figure in Israel that you know by
[2:52:17.960 --> 2:52:23.440]  the name of a hood but I touch a radioactive pedophile in New York City no with a 10 foot
[2:52:23.440 --> 2:52:29.760]  boy doesn't need that he wouldn't have needed that no he was actually debriefing the operation
[2:52:29.760 --> 2:52:35.040]  getting the material information oh sure so I mean we know is that the Israelis but but
[2:52:35.040 --> 2:52:38.480]  and I'm not defending Israel these governments do all sorts of horrible things our CIA's
[2:52:38.480 --> 2:52:41.840]  been caught doing it too who do you think he really worked for his Maxwell's connected
[2:52:41.840 --> 2:52:46.720]  to CIA and British intelligence her dad was killed in a boating accident I mean this is
[2:52:46.720 --> 2:52:51.000]  ridiculous so so who do you think really killed him you know you've got the British royals
[2:52:51.000 --> 2:52:54.560]  hanging out with him I'm not gonna say British intelligence is involved that's how all these
[2:52:54.560 --> 2:52:58.280]  intelligence agencies have been doing it particularly the British that's what they're known for
[2:52:58.280 --> 2:53:01.640]  when there's definitely there are meetings between the intelligence agencies and Epstein
[2:53:01.640 --> 2:53:05.880]  connected party sure and why is the former Israeli president running and secretly getting
[2:53:05.880 --> 2:53:10.400]  caught meeting with him when he's a convicted pedophile so give us the answer Carlos who
[2:53:10.400 --> 2:53:13.720]  do you think at the bottom of the barrel at the end of the day who was Epstein really
[2:53:13.720 --> 2:53:21.240]  working for the Epstein in fact with Prince Andrew please be careful because Prince Andrew
[2:53:21.240 --> 2:53:27.440]  was at the time he was a commercial a representative of the crown he was a commercial if you want
[2:53:27.440 --> 2:53:33.040]  to call it representative worldwide and he could bring lots of contacts and information
[2:53:33.040 --> 2:53:38.920]  and material about deals are going on in London he would access unprecedented access to anything
[2:53:38.920 --> 2:53:44.760]  you wanted to know about commercial transactions so he was in fact a good good break to have
[2:53:44.760 --> 2:53:48.880]  now the bottom line is that countries are not just Israel countries have always been
[2:53:48.880 --> 2:53:53.560]  running you know you're a smart guy that's why I went to you first I'm asking who do
[2:53:53.560 --> 2:54:00.560]  you think he really who do you think he first works for he actually took the job from Robert
[2:54:00.560 --> 2:54:07.200]  Maxwell and just name Maxwell and Robert Maxwell there's an anecdote and he was in my six and
[2:54:07.200 --> 2:54:13.080]  and CIA so who do you think really controlled Epstein that's right there's an actual anecdote
[2:54:13.080 --> 2:54:19.040]  with just name Maxwell and their father talking about Trump they used to she used the item
[2:54:19.040 --> 2:54:25.160]  the term premium items to refer to you know what the premium items and and she said to
[2:54:25.160 --> 2:54:31.040]  her father and there's in the big in a biography of Robert Maxwell it says that she actually
[2:54:31.040 --> 2:54:36.600]  told her father why don't I bring some of my premium items to you know this fellow
[2:54:36.600 --> 2:54:42.760]  Donald J. Trump you know because he would be a good contact and he was very upset at
[2:54:42.760 --> 2:54:47.320]  her and he told her all color also certain names and told her this man wouldn't touch
[2:54:47.320 --> 2:54:52.800]  your samples I remember that yeah oh yeah that's right so yeah one day on Saturday call
[2:54:52.800 --> 2:54:57.560]  in let's let's talk about Alex let's talk about Jeffrey Epstein no no no I agree and
[2:54:57.560 --> 2:55:02.520]  I'm not just here to defend Trump I actually know all of Trump's sexual proclivities and
[2:55:02.520 --> 2:55:07.320]  that's why they want Roger Stone so bad right Roger Stone was Trump's beard with supermodels
[2:55:07.320 --> 2:55:12.280]  that's what he likes and they had to be tested and screened and the guy is a germaphobe where
[2:55:12.280 --> 2:55:16.360]  he had to go basically train himself he loves people but he used to put you know the stuff
[2:55:16.360 --> 2:55:21.400]  on his hands okay he likes full grown women that's it he doesn't like children and that's
[2:55:21.400 --> 2:55:27.160]  why they want stone so bad because stone was his beard for 40 years and not for gay dudes
[2:55:27.160 --> 2:55:32.080]  a beard for women so Trump could go out with his girlfriends Roger Stone let's just get
[2:55:32.080 --> 2:55:37.360]  it out in the open the president doesn't like little kids like the rest of these people
[2:55:37.360 --> 2:55:41.320]  and that's why they don't like him he's not in the club but he had only released that
[2:55:41.320 --> 2:55:45.200]  on the president even though stones told me the president I checked articles about it
[2:55:45.200 --> 2:55:48.520]  back when the New York Times is more truthful I talked to others they go yeah that's true
[2:55:48.520 --> 2:55:51.960]  but stone was his beard and I brought up a stone he didn't want to get into it he said
[2:55:51.960 --> 2:55:55.760]  Trump wouldn't like it if it came out that Trump also likes black girls and stuff he's
[2:55:55.760 --> 2:55:59.960]  not racist and see that's what they can't stand and you know what this stuff needs to
[2:55:59.960 --> 2:56:04.320]  be out but they don't have anything on Trump they can't stand it yeah I mean Trump has
[2:56:04.320 --> 2:56:08.200]  done a very good job of avoiding the kind of entrapment scenarios that others had set
[2:56:08.200 --> 2:56:12.720]  up for other individuals over in positions of power over time and he also avoided all
[2:56:12.720 --> 2:56:16.240]  the memberships I mean he's one of the first people to get elected that wasn't didn't go
[2:56:16.240 --> 2:56:20.600]  to Bohemian Grove wasn't part of those wasn't part of the Bilderberg group wasn't he like
[2:56:20.600 --> 2:56:25.760]  six foot supermodels you know I'm his type is rather obvious by who he's married and
[2:56:25.760 --> 2:56:31.400]  who he's dated publicly over time and it's not in any kind of problematic behavior beyond
[2:56:31.400 --> 2:56:37.520]  you know fidelity might not be his strong suit you know that's not at all so and he's
[2:56:37.520 --> 2:56:41.720]  certainly not just grabbing random women no that's totally not who he look Trump's a
[2:56:41.720 --> 2:56:47.080]  control freak folks he's a total control freak he'd never be in a room being pissed on by
[2:56:47.080 --> 2:56:50.880]  Russians beings I mean give me a break now that was he had to have Roger Stone a few
[2:56:50.880 --> 2:56:55.440]  others vet women for months and months before he did why don't we believe this for me Daniels
[2:56:55.440 --> 2:57:00.040]  thing this Trump is not just running into hotel rooms with women that is not his nature
[2:57:00.040 --> 2:57:03.600]  and it doesn't fit the pattern I don't want to talk about the president's sexual past
[2:57:03.600 --> 2:57:07.720]  okay but I research all this stuff before I go all in well imagine how much scrutiny
[2:57:07.720 --> 2:57:12.240]  Trump has been in compared to past group presidents I mean Trump has been under a degree of scrutiny
[2:57:12.240 --> 2:57:16.400]  that almost no one has ever faced they've looked at every aspect I forget that one supermodel
[2:57:16.400 --> 2:57:20.680]  the playboy super good looking the brunette that also looks like his wife she said no
[2:57:20.680 --> 2:57:24.600]  he's a total gentleman we had a date a long time when he was he wasn't married for even
[2:57:24.600 --> 2:57:28.080]  have sex with me everybody's ever dated him and said that whether they've been liberals
[2:57:28.080 --> 2:57:31.800]  or conservatives no matter their politics most of the truth is they'd have to date him for
[2:57:31.800 --> 2:57:35.640]  months and Roger Stone would spy on him I mean I mean you want to get down the brass
[2:57:35.640 --> 2:57:39.000]  tax that's it man that I can't speak to you didn't want me know he would just make sure
[2:57:39.000 --> 2:57:42.600]  they were gonna give him from a problem oh right and that's why they want stone so bad
[2:57:42.600 --> 2:57:50.680]  yeah we'll be right back Alex Jones stop the iodine conspiracy wake up the world challenge

[3:00:11.000 --> 3:00:16.040]  actually well known in the gossip columns even the New York Times 20 30 years ago what
[3:00:16.040 --> 3:00:19.840]  I just told you and you know that's the thing trump does not does not want to have sex through
[3:00:19.840 --> 3:00:25.640]  children that's why he's not in the club I'd say about half of DC's pedophiles yeah both
[3:00:25.640 --> 3:00:31.100]  parts okay that's why we're in so much trouble let's go to Laura in Alabama then Gary Brad
[3:00:31.100 --> 3:00:35.600]  many others because everybody here then we'll get Matt bragger coming up go ahead Laura
[3:00:35.600 --> 3:00:43.360]  hello Alex I wanted to also mention you forgot one other source of power you're mentioning
[3:00:43.360 --> 3:00:47.880]  sources of power and that's turbo force which I'll be using to drive a couple of hours this
[3:00:47.880 --> 3:00:54.000]  afternoon thank you do you like turbo forces it's really good clean strong energy absolutely
[3:00:54.000 --> 3:00:58.880]  no crash no nothing I can sleep perfect even after taking it mid morning after so I love
[3:00:58.880 --> 3:01:03.840]  it and I have it on auto ship I reckon thank you would be here thank you won't run out
[3:01:03.840 --> 3:01:11.360]  you're welcome and I wanted to ask about impeachment and what you and Robert think about this is
[3:01:11.360 --> 3:01:19.560]  doesn't the president has really a mandate or a requirement to look into any of the Russian
[3:01:19.560 --> 3:01:23.040]  collusion when he came into office that was the big thing Russian collusion how did the
[3:01:23.040 --> 3:01:26.960]  Russians interfere in our election when he gets when he gets this new administration
[3:01:26.960 --> 3:01:32.960]  in the new regime in Ukraine they would be the ones to try to work with on all the past
[3:01:32.960 --> 3:01:39.160]  corruption and the past sticking their fingers in our election wouldn't he be required to
[3:01:39.160 --> 3:01:43.720]  work with this new regime to say what went on with crowd strike because this is something
[3:01:43.720 --> 3:01:47.440]  that was used against him even I would say he would have to look into it whether it benefits
[3:01:47.440 --> 3:01:51.840]  him or hurt him oh of course he's done nothing wrong there they're trying to paralyze the
[3:01:51.840 --> 3:01:56.400]  president and make everything a crime Barnes at the gubs he's handling legal stuff for
[3:01:56.400 --> 3:02:00.960]  us he was only an hour today but that'd be a good question for him but the whole things
[3:02:00.960 --> 3:02:05.160]  are fraud and again they just want to destabilize the president and keep him from looking into
[3:02:05.160 --> 3:02:11.840]  Ukraine so they're trying to impeach him for doing his job just like Russia Hillary sold
[3:02:11.840 --> 3:02:16.080]  us out to Russia and uranium one another areas publicly Trump was investigating that during
[3:02:16.080 --> 3:02:19.280]  the campaign so they made it about Russia with him that's what they do it's how they
[3:02:19.280 --> 3:02:25.240]  change the subject well right definitely and I think that when when we heard the CNN the
[3:02:25.240 --> 3:02:30.160]  head of CNN say okay we're going to pivot from Russia Russia Russia now we're pivoting
[3:02:30.160 --> 3:02:34.640]  to impeachment these are all just talking points so everyone's just going to pivot to impeach
[3:02:34.640 --> 3:02:37.920]  oh that's it and it's turned out all these whistleblowers aren't whistleblowers they're
[3:02:37.920 --> 3:02:42.320]  just liars and their lawyers are crazed maniacs saying we're going to remove the president
[3:02:42.320 --> 3:02:48.600]  well we'll make something up so yeah it's it's crazy Laura and math I personally think
[3:02:48.600 --> 3:02:53.760]  they didn't have anything so they're like well make something up just make it up just do it
[3:02:53.760 --> 3:02:59.480]  and by the way fc did not kill himself 100% God bless you I appreciate your call great
[3:02:59.480 --> 3:03:05.160]  point okay Laura let's go to the next caller here let's talk to Gary in Florida Gary thanks

[3:04:04.560 --> 3:04:16.520]  on at this point the Roger is one of the keys because unfortunately this administration
[3:04:16.520 --> 3:04:22.480]  which I love I love the president but by letting the signs stay where he's staying and can't
[3:04:22.480 --> 3:04:28.600]  speak to any of this stuff it was you know it's kind of like keeping him in the dark
[3:04:28.600 --> 3:04:32.720]  the truth can't come out we know that Roger didn't have communications is all a bunch
[3:04:32.720 --> 3:04:38.960]  of you know what we live through it but it's very key for Clinton to get back in you gotta
[3:04:38.960 --> 3:04:44.160]  be able to say well you see Roger did all this it was stolen from me and that's why
[3:04:44.160 --> 3:04:49.320]  I want to tell you back in 60 don't hang up I'm coming right back to you Gary you want
[3:04:49.320 --> 3:04:56.360]  to tell me I want to hear that cliffhanger with Gary than other callers please support

[3:05:21.440 --> 3:05:26.040]  never done a deal that good it's a hot item they sell tens of thousands of these a year
[3:05:26.040 --> 3:05:30.120]  it's a four-stage ion cluster other competing brands are four hundred five hundred six hundred
[3:05:30.120 --> 3:05:34.520]  seven hundred dollars the all the markup no ladies and gentlemen we usually sell these
[3:05:34.520 --> 3:05:40.800]  all day long for 250 they're a great deal 147 I almost I've told the guy like this cuts
[3:05:40.800 --> 3:05:45.360]  into the market so just low people don't appreciate it well this is what the info or audience gets
[3:05:45.360 --> 3:05:50.360]  info or store dot com there's only a few hundred of these left at this price and then more
[3:05:50.360 --> 3:06:16.440]  don't come in until next year are you the key master no are you a god no then die that's
[3:06:16.440 --> 3:06:21.960]  from Ghostbusters good movie sure you've all seen it Gary in Florida says that Roger Stone
[3:06:21.960 --> 3:06:27.080]  is the key master yeah they really they saw Epstein as a key master in all their pedophile
[3:06:27.080 --> 3:06:31.800]  rings Roger is the key master into Trump and there's really nothing there though that's
[3:06:31.800 --> 3:06:36.560]  why they want to make him lie about Trump he's got all these other little things they
[3:06:36.560 --> 3:06:41.480]  could make it look real because he's got all this other true stuff he could add in and
[3:06:41.480 --> 3:06:47.040]  up I mean again just don't never tell me anything I would find out some other people and dig
[3:06:47.040 --> 3:06:53.120]  through and see it and then he would he would confirm or deny you know that stuff I could
[3:06:53.120 --> 3:06:58.840]  tell you Roger Stone is scared of Trump and I don't mean that in a bad way he definitely
[3:06:58.840 --> 3:07:04.160]  respects him I mean even over the telephone he won't say anything bad about Trump and
[3:07:04.160 --> 3:07:07.960]  they're not going to get him to talk about Trump it's not going to happen so they're
[3:07:07.960 --> 3:07:11.320]  bargaining the wrong tree they're going to put Roger in prison for it by the way Gary
[3:07:11.320 --> 3:07:14.320]  go ahead from Florida and finish up the point you were making because I want to hear this
[3:07:14.320 --> 3:07:22.480]  Rogers the key master yeah no it's very important because and it's also you're very important
[3:07:22.480 --> 3:07:29.480]  to them and you know you getting the platform and you having all these lawsuits I'm a little
[3:07:29.480 --> 3:07:36.040]  worried so I mean you're also a key and I'm a guy who always listened to Fox News and
[3:07:36.040 --> 3:07:43.160]  I started listening to you and look I'm going into myself for stage cancer I have children
[3:07:43.160 --> 3:07:50.080]  I'm leaving and it's important it's important for me to kind of what I do is I read a lot
[3:07:50.080 --> 3:07:57.200]  I research a lot and I try and see where they're going based upon news and what their next moves
[3:07:57.200 --> 3:08:03.480]  are and you're important so I want you to be safe and I want you guys to your audience
[3:08:03.480 --> 3:08:09.200]  to know everything they do is a trojan horse up they'll say one thing they're going to
[3:08:09.200 --> 3:08:15.960]  do another thing and I said to you before the Republicans the Senate will sell out if
[3:08:15.960 --> 3:08:20.800]  it's not this one if it's not if it's not Russia and that's Ukraine it's not Ukraine
[3:08:20.800 --> 3:08:26.200]  they use another thing it's another year of this the Republicans are going to sell out
[3:08:26.200 --> 3:08:32.080]  now unfortunately or we don't know what Trump he could have in the beginning did but Obama
[3:08:32.080 --> 3:08:36.040]  and the rest of them did he could have came in and said I want to do some things for
[3:08:36.040 --> 3:08:40.440]  the country and the deep state could have said okay but we want you to let us do what
[3:08:40.440 --> 3:08:46.200]  we want in Syria and this and that and you could do this and we'll make a deal unfortunately
[3:08:46.200 --> 3:08:53.320]  you know or fortunately because it kind of showed us what's going on he woke us up and
[3:08:53.320 --> 3:09:00.640]  he woke us up fast as to the deep states you know their real intention and their real intentions
[3:09:00.640 --> 3:09:06.400]  are to power and control we got you know with the pedophile and all this stuff let's assume
[3:09:06.400 --> 3:09:12.440]  they're all criminals let's assume that assume all of that but well not assuming what people
[3:09:12.440 --> 3:09:17.440]  got to wake up to is they're they're they've sold out America they don't want what's good
[3:09:17.440 --> 3:09:22.080]  for America the question is how do they get all these and T-foot and these crazy people
[3:09:22.080 --> 3:09:27.000]  how do they get them to go crazy and that's where you got to look deeper you got to look
[3:09:27.000 --> 3:09:33.440]  into Syria you got to look into their pharmaceutical industry and the CIA and they have things called
[3:09:33.440 --> 3:09:38.800]  cap the gun which is like the stuff the Nazis used to give the people to go crazy they're
[3:09:38.800 --> 3:09:44.320]  not only going to smuggle through China fentanyl to make the Patriots slow they're going to
[3:09:44.320 --> 3:09:50.520]  smuggle stuff in to make the people that are already in the streets crazier oh you're absolutely
[3:09:50.520 --> 3:09:55.480]  right they are going to dump drugs just like the Joker would in the comic book chemical
[3:09:55.480 --> 3:09:59.160]  warfare you know Gary you've called before I've talked to you before I recognize your
[3:09:59.160 --> 3:10:03.080]  voice and just sad to hear you know what you're going through but it's it's all part of life
[3:10:03.080 --> 3:10:06.400]  and we love you and we appreciate you and thank you Gary for your support well that's
[3:10:06.400 --> 3:10:09.920]  very humbling and you know the listeners really are the family and that's why when I get the
[3:10:09.920 --> 3:10:13.920]  calls and I feel bad I don't get to enough calls and I feel bad having to leave one
[3:10:13.920 --> 3:10:18.720]  caller go to the next and just the real humanity out there and how many good people there are
[3:10:18.720 --> 3:10:23.400]  who worry about me but I'm worried about you and these people piss me off it's just it's
[3:10:23.400 --> 3:10:28.160]  just that there's so much evil because we've been in denial about it but the good thing
[3:10:28.160 --> 3:10:34.100]  is a lot of changes are happening and he mentions you know cancer I've got major scientific
[3:10:34.100 --> 3:10:40.400]  studies how it a hundred percent causes massive cancer and how it does it it rubs the molecules
[3:10:40.400 --> 3:10:45.240]  together inside your body and creates chemicals that make you go insane and give you cancer
[3:10:45.240 --> 3:10:50.320]  it's all right here I think I'm gonna start the show with us tomorrow and then all these
[3:10:50.320 --> 3:10:55.320]  thousands of quote top scientists sign a letter 11,000 scientists calling for extermination
[3:10:55.320 --> 3:11:00.760]  of humanity it's everything I've been telling you now that's out in the open I heard about
[3:11:00.760 --> 3:11:04.720]  it on NPR before Mike Adams was telling me about it the other day I heard him like 11,000
[3:11:04.720 --> 3:11:09.040]  scientists who must reduce world population and that humans are cancer and I'm so used
[3:11:09.040 --> 3:11:13.880]  to it I'm just now they're admitting it so I don't cover it when they admit it now because
[3:11:13.880 --> 3:11:20.720]  I've been covering it when it was secret so what are we gonna do about this I'm not told
[3:11:20.720 --> 3:11:27.040]  my wife this morning I said we gotta get everything out of the house Wi-Fi we moved to this house
[3:11:27.040 --> 3:11:32.480]  four years ago I'm in and no Wi-Fi cables put in in every rooms people could plug into
[3:11:32.480 --> 3:11:37.960]  them and then nobody uses it and now oh there's Wi-Fi for security cameras this is that it's
[3:11:37.960 --> 3:11:44.200]  all bad for you folks and now it's getting stronger and worse and I'm like we've got
[3:11:44.200 --> 3:11:51.880]  to stop it we got to move out to the country and it's so simple but they they don't you
[3:11:51.880 --> 3:11:56.200]  heard the caller trojan horse they give you something and it's killing you and it kills
[3:11:56.200 --> 3:12:00.560]  you slow and the cancer rates going straight up and I'm not gonna sit here and take it
[3:12:00.560 --> 3:12:05.640]  and it's these globalists remember when you remember all you folks when the when they're
[3:12:05.640 --> 3:12:10.760]  killing you remember they did it we can't fix this peacefully down the road just remember
[3:12:10.760 --> 3:12:21.480]  we're gonna win this one way or another okay who's been holding the longest here is it Tyler
[3:12:21.480 --> 3:12:28.440]  or is it Eli Eli Kentucky go ahead thanks for holding Eli yes Alex it's good to be back
[3:12:28.440 --> 3:12:33.720]  on the air with you the main point I wanted to make when I was calling today is about
[3:12:33.720 --> 3:12:38.920]  Kentucky elections but first I want to say that it pains me deep in my soul to see what's
[3:12:38.920 --> 3:12:46.360]  happening to Roger with the complete just ignoring the the principles of our constitution
[3:12:46.360 --> 3:12:51.800]  and denying that man his right of due process and ultimately in the end I do think Trump
[3:12:51.800 --> 3:12:58.200]  will come through and pardon him if the deep state convicts him but on to the Kentucky
[3:12:58.200 --> 3:13:02.640]  elections one thing I don't think well that I definitely know the mainstream media is
[3:13:02.640 --> 3:13:09.360]  not covering this our Secretary of State Alison London Graham she oversees the election process
[3:13:09.360 --> 3:13:18.520]  she was actually the opponent for Mitch McConnell in the last race in Kentucky in 2015 I believe
[3:13:18.520 --> 3:13:27.240]  her father recently was indicted on campaign fraud I remember that I saw that legal yes
[3:13:27.240 --> 3:13:33.160]  on a legal contributions to Allison's campaign he has now been convicted and he is awaiting
[3:13:33.160 --> 3:13:42.120]  his sentencing so already any like you say any sober person is going to have deep concerns
[3:13:42.120 --> 3:13:48.040]  with a criminal such as out and now they're going to have a governor that can pardon him
[3:13:48.040 --> 3:13:52.960]  absolutely and a lot of people also don't know that this is the son of the governor
[3:13:52.960 --> 3:13:58.320]  that Bevin beat out of office from a previous term that left our state and so much debt
[3:13:58.320 --> 3:14:05.520]  and now we technically as of right now voted in his crooked son but what I want to do point
[3:14:05.520 --> 3:14:09.880]  out people never go away it's like these dynasties sorry go ahead they they they never go away
[3:14:09.880 --> 3:14:15.080]  once it's the same thing in Washington down to the state level once they get their tentacles
[3:14:15.080 --> 3:14:24.520]  in it is nearly impossible to get them out however Bevin has not conceded the race technically
[3:14:24.520 --> 3:14:31.200]  as the polls show right now he only lost by three tenths of a percent if you look in
[3:14:31.200 --> 3:14:35.680]  Jefferson County which is the home of the liberal liberal theft pool known as Louisville
[3:14:35.680 --> 3:14:42.080]  Kentucky there were close to three hundred thousand votes that came out of that county
[3:14:42.080 --> 3:14:51.280]  in which brochure won by over a hundred thousand votes now that I really hope Bevin doesn't
[3:14:51.280 --> 3:14:56.200]  right now they're just doing a recantus but I really hope that he does a recount because
[3:14:56.200 --> 3:15:03.480]  I'm telling you four thousand forty six hundred votes is what Bevin lost by and it once again
[3:15:03.480 --> 3:15:09.560]  any sober person has to believe that there was massive voter fraud going on in that county
[3:15:09.560 --> 3:15:16.640]  of course there is and that's what they targeted that's what Democrats do I appreciate your
[3:15:16.640 --> 3:15:19.680]  call all right one more segment and then Matt Bracken is going to have two segments I'm
[3:15:19.680 --> 3:15:24.040]  commentating so he understands great patriot Matt Bracken coming up bottom of the hour

[3:23:02.760 --> 3:23:09.560]  alex um my take on the impeachment is even if it gets to the senate the republicans will not
[3:23:10.200 --> 3:23:16.920]  remove trump for one simple reason um they don't want to end their political careers they like their
[3:23:16.920 --> 3:23:22.600]  seats they like the power and perks that go with having those senate seats they themselves need 20
[3:23:22.600 --> 3:23:32.040]  republicans to go throw in with them to remove trump from office 23 are up this cycle in 2020
[3:23:32.040 --> 3:23:40.200]  and got 21 more up in 2022 there's no way but more in a handful of them maybe like a romney
[3:23:40.200 --> 3:23:45.480]  or something are gonna do it yeah yeah so the republicans are gonna do the right thing but
[3:23:45.480 --> 3:23:52.120]  they're gonna do it for the wrong reason i'm sorry right at the end my my uh fee was breaking up
[3:23:52.120 --> 3:23:57.240]  say that against her i said the republicans are going to do the right thing by keeping trump in
[3:23:57.240 --> 3:24:01.160]  office but they're going to do it for the wrong reason because they want to save their political
[3:24:01.160 --> 3:24:05.720]  hides not because it's the right thing to do i totally agree with you not true words have been
[3:24:05.720 --> 3:24:11.400]  spoken the last month on my show and that's why we've got to keep their fat evil globalist pitophile
[3:24:11.400 --> 3:24:19.400]  butts to the fire yep great point thank you sir thank you so much mark okay dany dany and portland

[3:24:28.600 --> 3:24:35.240]  issues with you know people in this upstream thing and the the trump impeachment and the
[3:24:36.440 --> 3:24:41.800]  roger stone case i mean it's it's basically what i'm starting to notice is everybody knows what's
[3:24:41.800 --> 3:24:45.640]  going on so people are just kind of sticking their head in the sand they don't want to they don't
[3:24:45.640 --> 3:24:50.360]  want to think about it uh well you're right we're reaching that point where it's all out in the open

[3:31:36.760 --> 3:31:43.400]  your age and it just really blew her away to read it there for herself and they know that two billion
[3:31:43.400 --> 3:31:47.960]  people ladies and gentlemen two billion are mentally retarded on the face of the earth right
[3:31:47.960 --> 3:31:53.720]  now because of iodine deficiency research it and find out for yourself now info wars dot com
[3:31:55.640 --> 3:32:01.240]  hosts ask me alex why do you have two different types of iodine well that's because different
[3:32:01.240 --> 3:32:07.240]  types of physiology different types of metabolic systems and people will like different formulas
[3:32:07.240 --> 3:32:14.200]  it's just that simple x3 is the deep earth crystal iodine and two other types because some people
[3:32:14.200 --> 3:32:21.160]  need all three types to absorb others like the pure atomic iodine get both they're both great for
[3:32:21.160 --> 3:32:27.720]  you whichever one you like use that and give the other to family or friends bottom line iodine is
[3:32:27.720 --> 3:32:33.800]  essential that's why i harp on it the globalist want you to be deficient in it for a lot of reasons
[3:32:33.800 --> 3:32:38.920]  lower iq makes you sluggish you don't live as long it's simple get your high quality iodine

[3:32:51.240 --> 3:33:10.760]  for 60 off together you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:33:10.760 --> 3:33:26.360]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 it's matt bracken you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:33:30.520 --> 3:33:38.040]  thing for the alex jones show is the chance to bring bring new people to the audience new new um
[3:33:38.040 --> 3:33:46.840]  new guests uh last week i had a former retired cia station chief uh bradley johnson on the founder
[3:33:46.840 --> 3:33:53.720]  of intel reform dot com he's a real old school cold warrior spook um you know that's trying
[3:33:53.720 --> 3:34:01.800]  to save the cia from this uh the john brennan globalist communist takeover um this week i
[3:34:01.800 --> 3:34:11.720]  have a new guest who's a who's a danish man uh named rasmus paludin paludin he is an attorney
[3:34:11.720 --> 3:34:18.840]  who has started uh something called the hardline party in denmark and he's a hardcore dude uh
[3:34:19.560 --> 3:34:25.800]  he he goes right out on the street in den in denmark uh and other places in europe and he tests
[3:34:25.800 --> 3:34:33.240]  the limits of the current limits of free speech especially in denmark where where i think that
[3:34:33.240 --> 3:34:39.000]  one way to look at it is a law might exist on the books but if you're afraid to use it because these
[3:34:39.000 --> 3:34:45.720]  islamic enclaves have become virtual no-go zones then the law might as well not exist you know if
[3:34:45.720 --> 3:34:51.800]  the if the uh jihadist thugs know that nobody's going to actually challenge them is that really
[3:34:51.800 --> 3:34:59.880]  danish territory or is that uh you know is that an island of islamicism so rasmus paludin actually
[3:34:59.880 --> 3:35:06.120]  goes into these areas generally with a police escort not always and does things like uh handle the
[3:35:06.120 --> 3:35:13.720]  quran uh other you know read from the quran do other things that that uh are seen as provocative
[3:35:13.720 --> 3:35:20.520]  provocations by the local uh the local muslims but it's it's just to say look you're in denmark
[3:35:20.520 --> 3:35:27.160]  this is our country and we still have free speech um rasmus are you there have i done a good job of
[3:35:27.160 --> 3:35:34.760]  setting this up um can you hear me there rasmus introduction was very good everything you said
[3:35:34.760 --> 3:35:40.760]  was true and accurate yeah i i was so impressed of some of the people that you have interviewed
[3:35:40.760 --> 3:35:47.560]  i've seen your your youtube interviews um diana west i've interviewed her here on info wars
[3:35:47.560 --> 3:35:53.320]  she's the author of american betrayal and the red thread every every info warrior should read these
[3:35:53.320 --> 3:36:00.920]  books um dr bill warner everybody here is familiar with his his essays on on political islam you
[3:36:00.920 --> 3:36:08.120]  know the 1400 year jihad uh trevor loudon he's a kiwi new zealander makes terrific documentaries
[3:36:08.120 --> 3:36:15.560]  on on the you know the red green alliance this fusion of of islam and and marxism that we see
[3:36:15.560 --> 3:36:21.160]  that we see today the fact that you've actually sat with these guys for hours and interviewed them
[3:36:21.160 --> 3:36:27.080]  it means that you really um at this point you you are yourself a goldmine of information so what
[3:36:27.080 --> 3:36:33.160]  i'd like to do is is just uh uh turn this segment over the next you know five or six minutes and
[3:36:33.720 --> 3:36:39.400]  and hear what you have to say about the state of of uh the jihad and the counter jihad in europe
[3:36:39.400 --> 3:36:47.240]  and globally anything you want to say right absolutely well i can tell you it's it's very
[3:36:47.240 --> 3:36:53.080]  clear if you look at western europe right now that's germany france belgium the nevelands
[3:36:53.720 --> 3:37:03.480]  danmark sweden the uk if we do nothing then all these countries will be muslim in not so many
[3:37:03.480 --> 3:37:11.480]  decades and that's because the the great replacement is not a conspiracy theory it's just a mathematical
[3:37:11.480 --> 3:37:18.760]  certainty because muslims in these countries they they get married and they produce offspring
[3:37:18.760 --> 3:37:25.480]  at a very young age and they produce a great number of children whereas the um inhabitant the
[3:37:25.480 --> 3:37:32.600]  original populations they marry late in life and they don't have a lot of children they get maybe
[3:37:32.600 --> 3:37:38.120]  two or less than two so it's a demographic replacement that's a mathematical certainty
[3:37:38.760 --> 3:37:46.680]  now that that's bad because our policy is that danes belong in danmark whereas
[3:37:46.680 --> 3:37:53.800]  arabic muslims belong not in danmark if i could choose i would say that arabic muslims belong
[3:37:53.800 --> 3:38:01.400]  in arabic muslim countries but i'm just saying they shouldn't be in danmark what we see everywhere
[3:38:01.400 --> 3:38:09.000]  in western europe is the same thing we've seen all through history is that wherever islam arrives
[3:38:09.000 --> 3:38:15.800]  where islam hasn't been before something that's usually quite peaceful turns into something
[3:38:16.520 --> 3:38:23.560]  not peaceful and that's what we see all over europe we have civil unrest because a lot of people
[3:38:23.560 --> 3:38:32.760]  with a very aggressive violent culture and religion muslims they arrive in great number they they do
[3:38:32.760 --> 3:38:40.440]  not get along with the natural population which is geochristian for the most part and and also
[3:38:40.440 --> 3:38:49.080]  overall they don't contribute they are a net deficit because for instance in danmark the
[3:38:49.080 --> 3:38:55.480]  socialist or social democratic welfare state the unilateral welfare state of the scandinavian
[3:38:55.480 --> 3:39:02.440]  countries is based on the premise that everybody wants to work if they're able to work and that
[3:39:02.440 --> 3:39:09.880]  only happens if you have a great sense of responsibility towards your countrymen and
[3:39:09.880 --> 3:39:18.440]  that can that can be evident if you have a very ethnically homogenous population then you will
[3:39:18.440 --> 3:39:23.720]  have that kind of loyalty to your countrymen that if you're able to work you will work and that's
[3:39:23.720 --> 3:39:30.840]  the only way a social welfare state will will work you can argue it won't work in the long
[3:39:30.840 --> 3:39:37.800]  run anyway but it will work for a while if that's the case that's not the case any longer we have
[3:39:37.800 --> 3:39:46.040]  a great number of mainly arabic northern african pakistani and afghani muslims they don't have any
[3:39:46.040 --> 3:39:52.360]  loyalty to these heathen danes that they are now living with and so they don't feel any need to work
[3:39:52.360 --> 3:39:59.640]  so we're paying them each month to do nothing or to commit crime now economically that's not
[3:39:59.640 --> 3:40:08.600]  going to work eventually the government will run out of money as far as as living in peace with the
[3:40:08.600 --> 3:40:16.440]  danes that's not working either because many things that we cherish very much in denmark
[3:40:16.440 --> 3:40:23.720]  which is primarily that you can be an individual that you can have a lot of individual autonomy
[3:40:23.720 --> 3:40:31.080]  and freedom that's completely contrary to the religion and political ideology of islam so
[3:40:31.080 --> 3:40:38.760]  that's not working and i think this is very clear if you look at what islam is then you'll see
[3:40:39.800 --> 3:40:45.560]  how is it how is it received by danes when you do these operations where you go into these um
[3:40:45.560 --> 3:40:51.480]  muslim enclaves i don't know if they're called a no-go zone there but i have seen where where um
[3:40:51.480 --> 3:40:59.160]  you know you have gone right into like these the plaza near a refugee center um even i think in one
[3:40:59.160 --> 3:41:06.360]  you even were like a jewish uh yamaka just to like really like instigate the hornet nest
[3:41:07.080 --> 3:41:13.320]  um yeah did danes see you as like a crazy radical that should just ignore them or you know how do
[3:41:13.320 --> 3:41:17.800]  how did danes see you and we're looking at this video here they're throwing they're throwing like
[3:41:17.800 --> 3:41:23.080]  emity uh pretty large explosives at you enough to break these windows let's watch this for just a
[3:41:23.080 --> 3:41:29.640]  moment but you can keep talking while we watch this yeah go this was about uh this was about uh
[3:41:29.640 --> 3:41:36.760]  10 days ago and i was in i wouldn't call it a no-go zone but i would call it a ghetto or a muslim
[3:41:37.720 --> 3:41:44.440]  enclave and you can see what happens is my body guards from the danish security intelligence
[3:41:44.440 --> 3:41:50.360]  service they're rushing me to the armored car to to evacuate me that's what happens these are police
[3:41:50.360 --> 3:41:56.280]  officers working for the security intelligence service unfortunately i have to be under 24 hour
[3:41:56.280 --> 3:42:01.480]  protection by the security intelligence service because otherwise the one or more muslims are
[3:42:01.480 --> 3:42:07.720]  going to kill me so i've had to have body guards from the government since the 16th of april this
[3:42:07.720 --> 3:42:15.880]  year and i foresee that will be this the state of affairs for for quite a long while but but i mean
[3:42:15.880 --> 3:42:24.440]  sure left-leaning danes that are either um cultural marxists or postmodernists or just traders or
[3:42:24.440 --> 3:42:31.320]  stupid they probably see me as a crazy person but we did get 1.8 percent of the vote at the
[3:42:31.320 --> 3:42:39.240]  recent parliamentary election in in in in june and the two percent is a threshold so we'll be back
[3:42:39.240 --> 3:42:43.960]  we have to rasmus we have to cut to a break um and we're going to pick this up in a couple minutes
[3:42:43.960 --> 3:42:48.200]  on the other side of this break we'll be right back with more of rasmus paladin

[3:47:11.080 --> 3:47:22.680]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones with matt bracken
[3:47:25.560 --> 3:47:30.920]  all right i'm i'm back and i'll uh i'm gonna continue my interview with razzmas paladin
[3:47:30.920 --> 3:47:37.160]  who's really got his finger on the pulse in in denmark and western europe but as well he's he has
[3:47:37.160 --> 3:47:41.880]  traveled the world interviewing and being interviewed by people you would recognize
[3:47:42.760 --> 3:47:50.200]  like diana west of dr bill warner and others of that caliber so i think that it's safe to say that
[3:47:50.200 --> 3:47:57.560]  that um you know he could write the book right now one the islamic uh 1400 year conquest that seems
[3:47:57.560 --> 3:48:04.520]  to be rolling rolling along only this time instead of being met at the gates of vienna
[3:48:04.520 --> 3:48:11.400]  quizzling traders inside the gates have opened all the gates and are are using this islamic
[3:48:11.400 --> 3:48:19.320]  jihad as like a weapon against nationalism to beat down the ethnic the ethnic peoples of europe
[3:48:19.320 --> 3:48:27.080]  native to europe so that uh there will be no more nation state there will just be uh you know of these
[3:48:27.080 --> 3:48:34.840]  feudal vassal states run by or run first out of um out of the eu and later some kind of a global
[3:48:34.840 --> 3:48:40.440]  government at least that seems to be the plan but in my opinion in the long run if there's a
[3:48:40.440 --> 3:48:47.560]  going to be a fusion of islam and and marxism islam's going to win because in the in the final debate
[3:48:47.560 --> 3:48:53.240]  the headchoppers usually end the debate you know it's hard to continue the marxist debate when your
[3:48:53.240 --> 3:48:59.880]  head has been chopped off you know the quran is always going to win when it comes down to a debate
[3:48:59.880 --> 3:49:07.320]  between tyrants anyway let's go back to um rasmus paladin and i want to hear him uh you know expound
[3:49:07.320 --> 3:49:12.440]  on what i've been saying and um you know what he thinks about my theories and where this is all going
[3:49:13.960 --> 3:49:19.480]  yeah well i was just saying uh before the break that that we got almost into parliament we were
[3:49:19.480 --> 3:49:26.360]  point two percent away from getting into parliament so it came very close and i agree completely that
[3:49:26.360 --> 3:49:34.760]  in the um in the debacle or in the fight between marxism and and islam islam is a far more crude
[3:49:34.760 --> 3:49:41.720]  and cruel uh ideology so the the muslims are going to win because they're not very interested in
[3:49:41.720 --> 3:49:49.080]  debate they're just interested in a proclamation the proclamation of the quran so if you don't agree
[3:49:49.080 --> 3:49:54.360]  with that they're just going to kill you and and that's what we see in all muslim countries you know
[3:49:54.360 --> 3:49:59.800]  there's never been an example of somewhere not muslim where the muslims have shown up and then we
[3:49:59.800 --> 3:50:06.680]  live together with them in harmony either we throw them out by saying james matamoros did on the
[3:50:06.680 --> 3:50:13.400]  iberian peninsula or they take over like they did in the middle east and in northern africa so
[3:50:13.400 --> 3:50:19.320]  that's quite clear and and that people here in danmark and elsewhere honestly believe in in
[3:50:19.320 --> 3:50:29.320]  a completely surreal naivete that that muslims will be able to live peacefully with non-muslims
[3:50:29.320 --> 3:50:35.480]  in western european countries that just shows that that you know the last idiot hasn't been born
[3:50:35.480 --> 3:50:41.480]  because that's never ever going to happen and you get that answer if you look at the theology of
[3:50:41.480 --> 3:50:47.080]  islam and you get that answer if you look at the history of islam so that's not going to happen and
[3:50:47.080 --> 3:50:54.200]  i actually think that the muslims in danmark showed their true color on the 14th of april of this
[3:50:54.200 --> 3:51:00.520]  year which is what catapulted me into national fame until then i was mainly known on youtube and i
[3:51:00.520 --> 3:51:06.760]  was certainly known by some international people in the counter jihadist movement but i wasn't
[3:51:06.760 --> 3:51:13.160]  known as the leader of the only ethno-nationalist party in danmark in the wide danish population
[3:51:13.160 --> 3:51:21.800]  until the 14th of april where i showed up on the most well-known muslim area square in the capital
[3:51:21.800 --> 3:51:28.520]  city of copenhagen i showed up with my deputy and we threw the koran towards each other twice
[3:51:29.240 --> 3:51:35.720]  and then muslims stormed yeah you see it here we threw it towards each other twice
[3:51:35.720 --> 3:51:43.480]  and you can see my deputy there he's taking on on his gloves and and then you'll see in a few
[3:51:43.480 --> 3:51:51.240]  seconds that everything is turning quite dramatically into hell or it's said in other words turning
[3:51:51.240 --> 3:52:00.600]  into yeah now it happens turning into the muslims showing what they actually are so there you see
[3:52:00.600 --> 3:52:06.360]  i was evacuated by the police in about five seconds one of the somalis he's being stopped by the
[3:52:06.360 --> 3:52:13.080]  police and and there we have me being escorted away or run away by the police and what happened
[3:52:13.080 --> 3:52:21.800]  this day in the capital city of copenhagen is the muslims and the extreme left activists
[3:52:22.440 --> 3:52:28.680]  criminals they turned to the streets and rioted so they attacked the police because of the
[3:52:28.680 --> 3:52:33.880]  perception that the police were supporting me which is not true the police were just protecting
[3:52:33.880 --> 3:52:40.040]  my right of peaceful public assembly so they turned towards the police and they rioted in the
[3:52:40.040 --> 3:52:47.080]  streets and and they turned fire in the streets and that is what catapulted me and the hardline
[3:52:47.080 --> 3:52:56.840]  party into national fame yeah i i compare this to um tommy robinson and in in the uk it seems like
[3:52:56.840 --> 3:53:02.680]  nobody's interested in free speech in fact they've thrown tommy robinson into prison twice in an
[3:53:02.680 --> 3:53:10.520]  attempt to break him down um so it looks at least in in denmark you're you're testing the limits of
[3:53:10.520 --> 3:53:16.440]  the sharia but you're also testing the limits of the danish police willing to protect your right
[3:53:16.440 --> 3:53:22.600]  to speak freely and go where you like in your country so i have to give points to the police
[3:53:22.600 --> 3:53:29.080]  there that looks better than in in germany or in or in the uk you know the films last week
[3:53:29.080 --> 3:53:38.120]  in in germany in in limburg a lady a german who had married and then divorced a i think tunisian
[3:53:38.120 --> 3:53:45.240]  man she had her head chopped off one video are videos like that actually seen on television
[3:53:45.240 --> 3:53:51.560]  in denmark or do you have to look for them on the internet somewhere no i mean what happened
[3:53:51.560 --> 3:53:59.800]  uh around christmas time last year was that at novigen and a danish female they went to morocco
[3:53:59.800 --> 3:54:06.600]  to go uh hill walking in the in the atlas mountains which was quite stupid because
[3:54:06.600 --> 3:54:11.800]  who would want to go to morocco which is a muslim country it's dangerous but they went there and
[3:54:11.800 --> 3:54:17.800]  sure enough they were kidnapped by muslims and the muslim terrorists they decided to make a little
[3:54:17.800 --> 3:54:24.920]  home video by chopping off their heads with knives while filming it so that's what happened and then
[3:54:24.920 --> 3:54:30.440]  you know danish media didn't show that and some danish alternative media did show it and what
[3:54:30.440 --> 3:54:37.960]  happens well all the the media outlets alternative media in denmark that showed the actual um the
[3:54:37.960 --> 3:54:44.280]  actual kidnapping and the the knife killing i mean they called it knife wounds but i've seen the video
[3:54:44.280 --> 3:54:53.080]  and and this is a live female dane who's having her head chopped off off with a knife and you can
[3:54:53.080 --> 3:54:57.560]  hear this is not enough these are not enough to wake up but these are not enough to wake up the
[3:54:57.560 --> 3:55:06.600]  danish people to wake them up to islam well i mean basically you have escapism here escapism is is
[3:55:06.600 --> 3:55:12.360]  when it's very very brutal to accept the truth and who wants to live in a country that you know
[3:55:12.360 --> 3:55:17.880]  is going straight to hell and you know that you have to do something because otherwise your country
[3:55:17.880 --> 3:55:25.080]  will be shit i mean nobody wants to hear that so there's a great cognitive dissonance between the
[3:55:25.080 --> 3:55:33.400]  reality and people think the reality is yeah it's denial denialism um rasmus where can people find
[3:55:33.400 --> 3:55:38.120]  you um on the internet what do you recommend for people looking for your right and so well i mean
[3:55:38.120 --> 3:55:44.360]  we have we have the youtube channel with about uh i think 42 000 subscribers more or less it's called
[3:55:44.360 --> 3:55:51.400]  stump whoops which is uh what what the our danish party name is in english it's hard line it means
[3:55:51.400 --> 3:55:57.480]  the same it means we're very tough on migration we don't have another trying uh we're not the
[3:55:57.480 --> 3:56:03.640]  leading hearts and artists party that's not us we just want happiness for the danes and i think i
[3:56:03.640 --> 3:56:11.480]  think you're i i think you're a very brave man to um essentially put yourself out as uh in in
[3:56:11.480 --> 3:56:18.680]  essence you know even possibly a sacrificial offering to try to wake up your countryman because
[3:56:18.680 --> 3:56:22.840]  it has to be very dangerous going where you are somebody might take a shot at you with
[3:56:22.840 --> 3:56:31.000]  something more than a small explosive next time well i mean um there was a female who threw some
[3:56:31.000 --> 3:56:38.920]  uh vinegar with some acid in it at me on friday so sure i mean uh these these people will do anything
[3:56:38.920 --> 3:56:45.880]  and i've had uh explosive thrown at me and i've been attacked on this many times so no that's why
[3:56:45.880 --> 3:56:50.760]  i have bodyguards from the government because it's quite concerning and at the same time you know
[3:56:51.560 --> 3:56:56.600]  uk is a lot more muslim than thenmark that's why tommy robison has far less protection from
[3:56:56.600 --> 3:57:03.720]  the government but in danmark they also hate me as a criminal by using hate speech laws against
[3:57:05.000 --> 3:57:10.520]  yeah rasmus that's uh we're coming to the end of the show so i'd like to thank you for coming on
[3:57:10.520 --> 3:57:16.040]  today and uh we'll keep you um in mind for uh you know events in western europe um as they're
[3:57:16.040 --> 3:57:22.840]  unfolding and um you know thank you again for for coming on today and uh i'm not sure if i'll be on
