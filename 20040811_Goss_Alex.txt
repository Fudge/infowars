[00:00:00.444 --> 00:00:01.204]  Wrong.
[00:00:01.204 --> 00:00:06.105]  The purpose of the United States of America is to be respected for what we are.
[00:00:06.105 --> 00:00:12.447]  Goss also weighed in on the age-old debate of preserving civil liberties versus protecting national security.
[00:00:12.447 --> 00:00:22.289]  We're talking about the balance between privacy on the one hand and protection from Big Brother government, but we're also talking about the government's responsibility to protect our people.
[00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.830]  It comes down to the choice that, as my staff has said to me many times,
[00:00:26.263 --> 00:00:29.192]  Between Big Brother and Dead Brother.
[00:00:29.192 --> 00:00:33.385]  And I think our first responsibility in government is to make sure we don't have any more Dead Brothers.
