[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]  Wrong. The purpose of the United States of America is to be respected for what we are.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000]  Goss also weighed in on the age-old debate of preserving civil liberties versus protecting national security.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000]  We're talking about the balance between privacy, on the one hand, and protection from big brother government.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000]  But we're also talking about the government's responsibility to protect our people.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.000]  It comes down to the choice that, as my staff has said to me many times, between big brother and dead brother.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000]  And I think our first responsibility in government is to make sure we don't have any more dead brothers.
