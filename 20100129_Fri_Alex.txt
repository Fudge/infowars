[00:00:04.781 --> 00:00:09.623]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.623 --> 00:00:11.203]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.203 --> 00:00:12.764]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.764 --> 00:00:16.945]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.945 --> 00:00:21.007]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:38.214 --> 00:00:42.876]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, welcome and thank you so much for joining us.
[00:00:42.876 --> 00:00:52.301]  This will be one of the last radio broadcasts of the first month of the new year, the month of January.
[00:00:52.301 --> 00:00:58.764]  2010 is almost over, hard to believe.
[00:00:58.764 --> 00:01:01.886]  Again, it's Friday, the 29th day of January, 2010.
[00:01:01.886 --> 00:01:05.388]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:14.277]  TV and movie star Dean Haglund will be joining us here in studio today.
[00:01:14.277 --> 00:01:21.181]  Told me he was going to be in town, wants to interview me for a documentary he is making, been making for the last four years.
[00:01:21.181 --> 00:01:24.963]  And he's getting ready to wrap that documentary up, wants to pop in and talk today.
[00:01:24.963 --> 00:01:30.105]  So we'll be having discussions with Dean Haglund here live on air.
[00:01:30.105 --> 00:01:36.129]  Of course, Dean worked on The X-Files and the spinoff Lone Gunman.
[00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:53.167]  Famously they had an episode six months before 9-11 where a secret group in the government hijacks a jet by remote control, a passenger jet, to fly to the World Trade Center to blame it on Afghanistan as a pretext to launch a new war and set up a police state in the United States.
[00:01:53.167 --> 00:01:55.610]  The criminal group within the Pentagon
[00:01:56.851 --> 00:01:57.231]  Yes.
[00:02:17.343 --> 00:02:19.324]  situation that is taking place.
[00:02:19.324 --> 00:02:24.646]  George Soros is running around trying to drive down the price of gold so he can buy it up of course.
[00:02:24.646 --> 00:02:38.731]  We'll discuss that with Bob Chapman and then climatologist Tim Ball will be popping in for about 30 minutes in the last hour today and the broadcast of course will be jam-packed with key information and news.
[00:02:38.731 --> 00:02:41.952]  Obama was laughed at during his State of the Union
[00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:49.021]  After calling climate change evidence overwhelming.
[00:02:49.021 --> 00:02:50.702]  And he got laughed at.
[00:02:50.702 --> 00:02:56.043]  And then Vice President Biden laughed behind him, and so did Pelosi.
[00:02:56.043 --> 00:03:03.386]  It's all very funny, a big joke on the people of the country.
[00:03:03.386 --> 00:03:06.207]  And on the climate takeover situation,
[00:03:08.018 --> 00:03:09.699]  I can't keep my eye on everything.
[00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:13.282]  I tend to look out internationally and nationally with what's happening.
[00:03:13.282 --> 00:03:25.591]  And I've known for a year, but now it's crept up on us, that Austin wants to have a complete and total takeover of every facet of our lives.
[00:03:25.591 --> 00:03:32.736]  And that the federal government and UN are openly bragging that they are running this system.
[00:03:33.598 --> 00:03:41.761]  And they brought in feds and internationalists and others to run the operation in Austin, Texas.
[00:03:41.761 --> 00:03:46.082]  And Paul Watson's writing an article about that right now.
[00:03:46.082 --> 00:03:49.283]  It'll be out before the show ends today.
[00:03:49.283 --> 00:03:53.644]  They're set to vote on it, the city council is saying, next month.
[00:03:53.644 --> 00:03:59.666]  And they admit, this is the city council admitting, along with Austin Energy, that it will cost $2.6 billion.
[00:04:03.047 --> 00:04:08.330]  Now, generally, government underestimates what something will cost by about a third.
[00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.532]  It'll probably end up being over $6 billion.
[00:04:11.532 --> 00:04:14.353]  If they say it's a billion, it's $3 or $4 billion.
[00:04:14.353 --> 00:04:16.394]  If they say it's $2 billion, it's $6 or $7 billion.
[00:04:16.394 --> 00:04:21.377]  If they say it's $2.6 billion, it'll probably be $10 billion by the time they're done.
[00:04:21.377 --> 00:04:26.420]  A total takeover, cutting off Austin Energy, scrapping
[00:04:28.837 --> 00:04:30.177]  Cold-fired plants.
[00:04:30.177 --> 00:04:34.559]  This started over a decade ago where they would take city-owned plants and just shut them down.
[00:04:34.559 --> 00:04:37.319]  Bilderberg Group is involved in this big time.
[00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:42.381]  We covered that in 2008 with what happened in Turkey when Rick Perry went there.
[00:04:42.381 --> 00:04:46.202]  We told you it was about shutting off the energy to Texas.
[00:04:46.202 --> 00:04:48.662]  K-Baby's involved in that as well.
[00:04:48.662 --> 00:04:49.883]  So that is coming up.
[00:04:51.457 --> 00:04:52.678]  That's the tip of the iceberg.
[00:04:52.678 --> 00:05:00.525]  You'll want to stay with us, ladies and gentlemen, because this is going to be a jam-packed transmission today on this Friday edition.
[00:05:00.525 --> 00:05:03.527]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:05:03.527 --> 00:05:08.872]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:05:08.872 --> 00:05:10.914]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:05:10.914 --> 00:05:15.918]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:05:15.918 --> 00:05:16.819]  How much do you want?
[00:05:17.079 --> 00:05:18.200]  When do you want it?
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.082]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:05:20.082 --> 00:05:21.162]  When will you need it?
[00:05:21.162 --> 00:05:23.364]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:05:23.364 --> 00:05:24.705]  Will there be any food?
[00:05:24.705 --> 00:05:26.227]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:05:26.227 --> 00:05:31.511]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:05:31.511 --> 00:05:35.094]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:05:35.094 --> 00:05:38.557]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:05:38.897 --> 00:05:40.118]  How much will you need?
[00:05:40.118 --> 00:05:41.019]  We don't know.
[00:05:41.019 --> 00:05:42.120]  How much do you want?
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.061]  All you can get.
[00:05:43.061 --> 00:05:44.162]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:05:44.162 --> 00:05:47.204]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:05:47.204 --> 00:05:48.986]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:05:48.986 --> 00:05:49.906]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:06:01.787 --> 00:06:05.837]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:06:05.837 --> 00:06:09.064]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:06:09.064 --> 00:06:10.467]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[00:06:11.167 --> 00:06:13.848]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:06:13.848 --> 00:06:20.230]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:25.432]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:06:25.432 --> 00:06:35.395]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:06:35.535 --> 00:06:37.877]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:06:37.877 --> 00:06:39.478]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:06:39.478 --> 00:06:41.760]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:44.061]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:06:44.061 --> 00:06:49.205]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:06:49.205 --> 00:06:58.312]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:07:01.613 --> 00:07:11.519]  Are you suffering from issues related to angina pain, high blood pressure, congestive heart failure, unbalanced cholesterol, irregular heartbeats, clogged arteries?
[00:07:11.519 --> 00:07:13.560]  If so, you are not alone.
[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:16.782]  Millions of people are suffering from one or more of these problems.
[00:07:17.062 --> 00:07:17.603]  We're good to go.
[00:07:35.558 --> 00:07:36.059]  We're good to go.
[00:08:01.937 --> 00:08:08.565]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.565 --> 00:08:11.549]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:24.266 --> 00:08:30.290]  Dean Haglund, X-Files and Lone Gunman star, will be joining us in studio to talk about the New World Order.
[00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:33.471]  The whole global government system, his take on it, in studio next hour.
[00:08:33.471 --> 00:08:36.933]  Bob Chapman, Dr. Tim Ball, and others joining us today.
[00:08:36.933 --> 00:08:42.177]  Let me get into a massive news blitz right now.
[00:08:42.177 --> 00:08:45.799]  First off, we have defeated Copenhagen.
[00:08:45.799 --> 00:08:52.843]  Even George Soros admitted at Davos yesterday that it has completely fallen apart.
[00:08:53.991 --> 00:08:57.393]  And that they've got to regroup and try to bring in their global governance taxes.
[00:08:57.393 --> 00:09:14.500]  He went on to say that the large central banks of the world will just increase their fraudulent power of SDRs, where they just issue themselves massive amounts of funding.
[00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:22.744]  And that they will simply go in and buy up and pay off the third world and the first world to adopt this system.
[00:09:33.226 --> 00:09:45.427]  Now Arnold Schwarzenegger, in the last day of the conference last month, as it fell apart, he said that they were going to do an end run around the Congress, around the House and Senate.
[00:09:45.427 --> 00:09:46.830]  The Senate's refused to pass it.
[00:09:48.288 --> 00:09:54.850]  They said they would do an end-run around it and would go to the state and local level and implement this taxation system.
[00:09:54.850 --> 00:10:04.354]  And the test city on the UN's own website and all the big phony environmentalist websites is Austin, Texas and Los Angeles and San Francisco.
[00:10:05.254 --> 00:10:08.616]  And several other cities where they believe they've got control.
[00:10:08.616 --> 00:10:19.303]  Austin openly gets awards from leaders of foreign governments like Vicente Fox for not following laws, for making Austin a sanctuary city.
[00:10:19.303 --> 00:10:25.607]  It is a lawless city that does whatever it wants and is fully controlled by offshore corporations.
[00:10:26.923 --> 00:10:30.166]  It is involved in violations of state law.
[00:10:30.166 --> 00:10:34.491]  The city cannot just do whatever it wants in violation of state law.
[00:10:34.491 --> 00:10:38.335]  They can't shut down gun shows without a law because they feel like it.
[00:10:38.335 --> 00:10:45.903]  They can't put a $2.6 billion tax, and that's Austin Clean Energy and Security Act.
[00:10:46.909 --> 00:10:49.973]  That's what they themselves are saying.
[00:10:49.973 --> 00:11:00.244]  I got up at 5.30 this morning, turned on NewsRadio 590, and heard Austin Energy itself telling us how great this was going to be, and telling us that it was going to create jobs.
[00:11:00.244 --> 00:11:03.148]  Really, Spain did this, and for every
[00:11:04.329 --> 00:11:16.442]  Green job they created, they lost 2.2 jobs and each job created cost $700,000 even though the average person in Spain with a green job was paid the equivalent of $51,000.
[00:11:16.442 --> 00:11:17.443]  Why not just give people
[00:11:20.966 --> 00:11:21.046]  $700,000.
[00:11:21.046 --> 00:11:42.295]  No, the $700,000 is paid into select globalist so-called green energy companies that Pachari, the head of the IPCC, that Barack Obama, the president, that the former vice president Al Gore, the Rothschilds, they're all over the news making taxpayer money out of these scams.
[00:11:42.955 --> 00:12:02.401]  They've got 20-year-old technology that's cost over a billion dollars outside Austin and Bastrop that produces less power from solar than one small, cold-fired plant they shut down known as the Holly Street plant in downtown Austin on the river.
[00:12:03.444 --> 00:12:09.185]  Now that's how scams work.
[00:12:09.185 --> 00:12:15.186]  $700,000 goes to the corrupt corporations for every stinking job they create.
[00:12:15.186 --> 00:12:22.407]  Here's NewsRadio 590 reporting, Austin's carbon reduction plan, more than cap-and-trade, bill proposes.
[00:12:22.407 --> 00:12:31.409]  A higher level, immediately, than even what the treaty calls for, at least a 30% cut in our, quote, carbon dioxide output.
[00:12:32.069 --> 00:12:43.893]  Austin Energy's carbon reduction plan calls for Austin's CO2 emissions to be reduced by a greater amount than what the Austin Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 called for.
[00:12:43.893 --> 00:12:47.074]  They're going even further than what the UN calls for.
[00:12:47.074 --> 00:12:50.815]  Even further than what Austin said it would do last year.
[00:12:50.815 --> 00:12:55.776]  That way they know people will fight them and they'll say, okay, we'll just go with what we wanted last year, a 1.5 billion dollar tax.
[00:12:58.655 --> 00:13:01.536]  Also known as the Cap-and-Trade Bill, the Act was passed by the U.S.
[00:13:01.536 --> 00:13:12.160]  House of Representatives in June, but not the Senate, and calls for emissions to be reduced by 17 percent, it's actually about 30, by 2020, compared to the record recorded levels of 2005.
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:19.443]  Austin Energy head Roger Duncan says the local utility plan calls for a 20 percent reduction.
[00:13:19.443 --> 00:13:23.405]  To see the presentation Duncan presented to the Austin City Council, click here.
[00:13:24.105 --> 00:13:31.809]  Duncan says putting the plan in place would potentially cost the city around $2.6 billion just to launch it.
[00:13:31.809 --> 00:13:33.230]  Not just your cost.
[00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:34.851]  This is a taxing grid.
[00:13:34.851 --> 00:13:36.912]  That's just the cost of this.
[00:13:36.912 --> 00:13:43.095]  He says Austin energy consumers would expect to see slight rate increases in three years.
[00:13:43.095 --> 00:13:44.236]  Yes, slight.
[00:13:44.236 --> 00:13:47.317]  Natural gas is absolutely cheap right now.
[00:13:47.317 --> 00:13:51.580]  What is it, $3 per British cubic thousand feet or whatever?
[00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:58.063]  It was 15 bucks a year ago, but gas prices are more in this town.
[00:13:58.063 --> 00:14:10.511]  It's totally clean burning, but the environmentalist, and I heard him on newscast last night, saying they've got to get rid of gas use in Austin by taxing you when you use natural gas.
[00:14:12.349 --> 00:14:17.513]  Here we are in Texas, enough natural gas to run the entire planet, oh yes, the U.S.
[00:14:17.513 --> 00:14:22.417]  producing more than any other country passing Russia last year, but we have to have a tax on it.
[00:14:22.417 --> 00:14:24.198]  You can't have that cheap energy.
[00:14:24.198 --> 00:14:29.722]  No, no, no, no, no.
[00:14:29.722 --> 00:14:37.248]  Duncan says putting the plan in place could potentially cost the city around $2.6 billion just to put in the ugly wind farms.
[00:14:39.235 --> 00:14:43.317]  Just to put the stinking wind farms in.
[00:14:43.317 --> 00:14:52.942]  And then each wind farm puts out such a small amount of power that you end up losing most of the power in the transmission of it to the cities.
[00:14:52.942 --> 00:14:58.445]  Because they want to build the things 100 miles from here.
[00:14:58.445 --> 00:15:03.688]  It turns out in the studies it takes more energy than you end up saving to build the stinking things.
[00:15:06.735 --> 00:15:20.958]  And I've asked Watson to dig up that Statesman article from six months ago where they admit the Pentagon's involved in Austin, and they're sending former black op commanders and colonels, it listed their names in the paper, to run things in Austin, and they're running it.
[00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:23.518]  Yes, we're all going into serfdom here in Austin.
[00:15:23.518 --> 00:15:26.659]  Total slavery to these people.
[00:15:26.659 --> 00:15:32.180]  Now remember, I told you, they can't get the Congress to pass it, so they're going to take over your cities.
[00:15:33.988 --> 00:15:45.675]  They come in with unlimited foreign bank money that they've looted and stolen from the taxpayers, they shut off your energy, and then make you buy their overpriced energy and make money putting the systems in.
[00:15:45.675 --> 00:15:49.457]  States to lead carbon markets at its federal plan stalls.
[00:15:49.457 --> 00:15:52.339]  I just thought I'd pull that up from January 7th from Bloomberg.
[00:15:52.339 --> 00:15:54.600]  It's not just Alex Jones saying it.
[00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:56.742]  It's their official battle plan.
[00:15:57.901 --> 00:16:05.666]  And Lee Leffingwell, the horrid mayor we have, says that next month they're going to pass this.
[00:16:05.666 --> 00:16:07.967]  They're going to have a staged town hall.
[00:16:07.967 --> 00:16:09.948]  Everyone needs to get to that town hall.
[00:16:09.948 --> 00:16:14.330]  We need to get a massive protest set up now.
[00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:15.931]  Everyone needs to go down there.
[00:16:15.931 --> 00:16:17.512]  Everyone needs to be there.
[00:16:17.512 --> 00:16:20.974]  Now what the city will do is they'll give permits to their pets.
[00:16:20.974 --> 00:16:22.675]  You don't need permits to protest.
[00:16:22.675 --> 00:16:25.357]  People have won lawsuits over and over again in Austin.
[00:16:25.357 --> 00:16:27.138]  I don't get permits to protest in Austin.
[00:16:28.302 --> 00:16:31.304]  The only place you have to get it is for the time on the steps of the Capitol.
[00:16:31.304 --> 00:16:39.929]  If you want their broadcast system, their radio system, their PA system, you don't have to get one to be out on the front of the Capitol.
[00:16:39.929 --> 00:16:50.074]  What they'll do is they'll have all their NGO pets out there, and then when the real Americans show up, they'll run in and cause a fracas, and then say that you're not allowed to be there protesting.
[00:16:50.074 --> 00:16:52.496]  That's how they run their operations now, we've discovered.
[00:16:53.766 --> 00:17:01.007]  But again, we need people all over the country to go to this yet-unannounced meeting time next month in their fake town hall.
[00:17:01.007 --> 00:17:09.689]  Now, we went and shot down the Patriot Act in Austin, and we're going to do the same thing this time, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:17:09.689 --> 00:17:12.189]  This is a major battle line.
[00:17:12.189 --> 00:17:15.950]  A front-line fight, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:20.991]  A front-line fight against the new world order coming up.
[00:17:23.357 --> 00:17:29.019]  States to lead carbon markets as federal plan stalls.
[00:17:29.019 --> 00:17:33.901]  State governments across the nation are likely to dominate the emerging U.S.
[00:17:33.901 --> 00:17:49.706]  carbon market in 2010 amid doubts that Congress will pass an emissions trading law this year, while cap and trade legislation, which will create carbon dioxide permits, oh you get permits, state, local, federal, international, all these new taxing authorities, that companies could buy and sell
[00:17:50.808 --> 00:17:51.689]  ...installed in the U.S.
[00:17:51.689 --> 00:17:59.198]  Senate a group of Northeastern states already has a carbon market, and two more regional programs in the Midwest and West plan to file a suit.
[00:17:59.198 --> 00:18:00.820]  Austin, Texas!
[00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:09.110]  Then they'll take all the derivatives money they make, scam everybody, use that to buy up more land, and then when they pop that bubble, they'll have you bail them out.
[00:18:10.359 --> 00:18:13.801]  Again, the Austin is run by a group of criminals that under S.O.S.
[00:18:13.801 --> 00:18:22.846]  stole tens of thousands of acres, said it was for environmental biospheres, then turned it around and sold it to themselves for pennies on the dollar, built hotels, apartments, everything else.
[00:18:22.846 --> 00:18:24.466]  I mean, they own their own banks.
[00:18:24.466 --> 00:18:27.148]  It's just a giant swindle, and they love it.
[00:18:28.154 --> 00:18:36.620]  Just like the insurance plan, the healthcare was a big scam, and the bailout, and the flu, and everything else is a scam.
[00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:40.343]  Regional level carbon trading is where the action is going to be this year.
[00:18:40.343 --> 00:18:50.770]  Bill Becker, Executive Director of the National Association of Clean Air Agencies, which represents state and local environmental regulators, said in an interview, See, this is their battle plan.
[00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:52.151]  Take over the states.
[00:18:52.151 --> 00:18:54.233]  They were always going with this plan.
[00:18:54.233 --> 00:18:55.934]  International, national, and local.
[00:18:57.262 --> 00:19:06.929]  Under cap-and-trade, the government issued a limits number of permits, also called allowances, each carrying the right to emit one ton of carbon dioxide.
[00:19:06.929 --> 00:19:10.511]  Humans put out 1.5 pounds on average a day.
[00:19:10.511 --> 00:19:11.612]  You will be taxed.
[00:19:11.612 --> 00:19:13.693]  A carbon ration openly being announced.
[00:19:13.693 --> 00:19:18.957]  Now remember, this has been proven to be an absolute, complete fraud.
[00:19:18.957 --> 00:19:21.379]  Carbon dioxide is what plants breathe.
[00:19:21.379 --> 00:19:22.680]  It's what humans exhale.
[00:19:24.471 --> 00:19:27.455]  It's been proven from their own internal emails at the UN.
[00:19:27.455 --> 00:19:28.736]  They know it's a fraud.
[00:19:28.736 --> 00:19:31.239]  It's a tax to the IMF and World Bank.
[00:19:31.239 --> 00:19:36.445]  They know it's a fraud, so on this fraud, they're trying to take over the major cities.
[00:19:37.515 --> 00:19:38.897]  In the East.
[00:19:38.897 --> 00:19:40.638]  In Texas.
[00:19:40.638 --> 00:19:42.100]  In California.
[00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:49.047]  And the first city to try to ram through an environmentalist dictatorship is Austin, Texas.
[00:19:49.047 --> 00:19:51.970]  All you brainwashed hippies are useful idiots.
[00:19:51.970 --> 00:19:56.455]  Wake up and realize the scam before it's too late, you morons.
[00:19:56.455 --> 00:19:58.037]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:20:00.717 --> 00:20:05.120]  Americans have heard much about change in recent times and are now waking up to the truth.
[00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:08.283]  Well, here's a few facts about your food you may want to change.
[00:20:08.283 --> 00:20:15.768]  Did you know that nearly 100% of the food on store shelves comes from a few corporations and that most is genetically engineered, chemically sprayed,
[00:20:15.828 --> 00:20:16.368]  I think so.
[00:20:32.022 --> 00:20:41.587]  Gardeners and homesteaders know Baker Creek offers some of the most popular seed collection kits, like our Large Heirloom Kit with 60 full-size seed packets for only $99.
[00:20:41.587 --> 00:20:48.191]  The kit contains 25 types of vegetables and comes packaged in a metal can for long-term storage for just $99.

[00:21:00.157 --> 00:21:06.482]  Did you know that the dollar has lost 10% of its value against other currencies in the last 90 days?
[00:21:06.482 --> 00:21:11.426]  Ever think about how inflation will change your life, your savings, your retirement plans?
[00:21:11.426 --> 00:21:15.509]  Remember inflation in Zimbabwe, Argentina, the Weimar Republic?
[00:21:15.509 --> 00:21:16.850]  Let's put this another way.
[00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:22.214]  Who cares if your investments go up 10% but you lose 40% of your purchasing power?
[00:21:22.214 --> 00:21:25.117]  Gold still buys the same amount of stuff it always did.
[00:21:25.117 --> 00:21:27.759]  Gold does not require trust in a third party.
[00:21:27.759 --> 00:21:29.160]  You can possess it in your hand.
[00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:30.721]  You can take it with you.
[00:21:30.721 --> 00:21:32.201]  Gold is real money.
[00:21:32.201 --> 00:21:33.562]  Gold is honest money.
[00:21:33.562 --> 00:21:36.303]  My name is Daniel Larson from Midas Resources.
[00:21:36.303 --> 00:21:43.486]  To find out how you can protect your savings and roll over your IRA funds into precious metal accounts, call me at 800-686-2237, extension 134.
[00:21:43.486 --> 00:21:44.707]  That's 800-686-2237, extension 134.
[00:21:44.707 --> 00:21:45.467]  800-686-2237, extension 134.
[00:22:01.619 --> 00:22:05.644]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:22:05.644 --> 00:22:08.887]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:22:08.887 --> 00:22:10.309]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[00:22:11.016 --> 00:22:13.699]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:22:13.699 --> 00:22:20.085]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:22:20.085 --> 00:22:25.149]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:22:25.149 --> 00:22:35.259]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:22:35.379 --> 00:22:37.721]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:22:37.721 --> 00:22:39.322]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:22:39.322 --> 00:22:41.764]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:22:41.764 --> 00:22:43.905]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:22:43.905 --> 00:22:49.049]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:22:49.049 --> 00:22:54.053]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[00:22:54.053 --> 00:22:58.156]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:23:00.185 --> 00:23:00.866]  Hello.
[00:23:00.866 --> 00:23:05.610]  At OfTheField.com, we strive to empower you with wild food preparedness.
[00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:10.434]  We get lots of amazing positive feedback, most of which we feature on OfTheField.com.
[00:23:10.434 --> 00:23:15.218]  Here's a small sample of all that people like you have to say about the wild food experience.
[00:23:15.578 --> 00:23:19.660]  It's inspiring for many who are affected by the recent downturn of the economy.
[00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:23.701]  I already knew a bit about foraging and edibles, but you take it to a whole new level.
[00:23:23.701 --> 00:23:26.502]  A thousand thanks to you for all that great knowledge.
[00:23:26.502 --> 00:23:27.523]  It was empowering.
[00:23:27.523 --> 00:23:31.524]  When I was in the Navy, I went through a couple of quick land survival classes.
[00:23:31.524 --> 00:23:34.345]  Thank you for being an inspiration and for all the work that you do.
[00:23:34.345 --> 00:23:37.086]  I really appreciate the depth and detail of the information.
[00:23:37.086 --> 00:23:38.186]  Thank you so much.
[00:23:38.186 --> 00:23:41.048]  Much love and respect to you from all of us here in the boonies.
[00:23:41.048 --> 00:23:41.788]  Thanks again.
[00:23:41.788 --> 00:23:44.389]  Knowledge is power, and that power brings peace.
[00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:48.565]  Folks, thanks for letting us help you get back to basics.
[00:23:48.565 --> 00:23:52.169]  Read all of the testimonials at ofthefield.com.
[00:23:52.169 --> 00:23:56.495]  You can order online for you and your loved ones, or call 1-888-51-EAT-FREE to share in the secret.
[00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:09.582]  It's simple.
[00:24:09.582 --> 00:24:22.218]  International banks come in, take over your country, buy off your Congress, your Parliaments, your state legislatures, have massive taxes paid to them, then they take that money,
[00:24:23.817 --> 00:24:40.852]  And they come in and buy off your legislatures further, have them enact laws to put toll roads on all your major roads, have private companies, the banks finance and own and control, get the money from the toll roads, they then take that money, buy off more existing roads,
[00:24:41.833 --> 00:24:47.778]  They have the states and the feds build new roads with taxpayer money, which are then given to them.
[00:24:47.778 --> 00:24:49.479]  They get the profit from that.
[00:24:49.479 --> 00:24:55.384]  We've been fighting the North American Union, the NAFTA superhighways, the Trans-Texas Corridor.
[00:24:56.738 --> 00:25:07.146]  They come in, they shut down your plants, shut down your coal plants, make you take overpriced wind power systems, overpriced solar powered systems.
[00:25:07.146 --> 00:25:16.594]  The federal government taxes you, sends back about 30 cents on the dollar to the state, saying you must spend this money on, quote, green renewable energy.
[00:25:16.594 --> 00:25:19.356]  They tell you what companies you must buy it from.
[00:25:19.356 --> 00:25:24.000]  Al Gore, George Soros, Rockefeller, Rothschild, Pachari Controlled.
[00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:26.385]  And that's just how the scam works.
[00:25:26.385 --> 00:25:31.218]  An organized economy by them for their profit and for their control.
[00:25:32.188 --> 00:25:37.430]  And so, yes, we shot down a lot of the Copenhagen operation, but they're not stopping.
[00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:46.474]  And we've got to go to every city council, you've got to go to the citizens' communications, the county commissioners, your legislatures, and say, no, you can't do this.
[00:25:46.474 --> 00:25:48.115]  Here's the Austin American-Statesman.
[00:25:48.115 --> 00:25:53.037]  Energy plan comes to city council as legislature plans review.
[00:25:53.037 --> 00:25:56.438]  Proposal to add more renewable energy to be presented.
[00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:00.261]  And then you read, it sounds reasonable, oh, more renewable energy.
[00:26:00.261 --> 00:26:05.862]  All it is is shutting down the power plants, as they've said in their actual press releases.
[00:26:05.862 --> 00:26:14.823]  $2.6 billion in Austin alone, just to put in the systems, and then all the new taxes and costs.
[00:26:14.823 --> 00:26:23.425]  Robbing you, completely criminal, as the shops and stores and factories and businesses shut down everywhere.
[00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:31.790]  As Detroit implodes, as the depression accelerates, this is their answer.
[00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:35.656]  Take over the states, take over the cities.
[00:26:35.656 --> 00:26:39.922]  It is outrageously criminal what is going on.
[00:26:43.925 --> 00:26:47.167]  I want to play a clip now of Obama being laughed at.
[00:26:47.167 --> 00:26:59.335]  It's a brief clip and the Republicans and some of the Democrats laugh at him when he says the science is settled and that we know man-made global warming is real.
[00:26:59.335 --> 00:27:06.099]  My son plays a little history online game called Brain Pop.
[00:27:07.051 --> 00:27:09.294]  And in there they say it's wrong to hunt.
[00:27:09.294 --> 00:27:11.656]  They say it's wrong to collect butterflies.
[00:27:11.656 --> 00:27:14.379]  That the polar bears are dying.
[00:27:14.379 --> 00:27:16.321]  It's literally a bunch of deception.
[00:27:16.321 --> 00:27:18.364]  And this is what's in the textbooks.
[00:27:18.364 --> 00:27:19.405]  This is everywhere.
[00:27:19.405 --> 00:27:24.530]  Just 24-7 brainwashing as the system says.
[00:27:25.626 --> 00:27:27.847]  That no one questions it.
[00:27:27.847 --> 00:27:47.275]  It's an absolute scientific fact, as in every case, the UN has been caught with big corporations and the oil companies who want this new taxing system, they want to charge you more for fuel, because they themselves are owned by the big banks that get the tax money, as it's proven that it's all a premeditated fraud.
[00:27:47.275 --> 00:27:50.057]  Here is Obama from a State of the Union.
[00:27:50.057 --> 00:27:54.899]  I know that there are those who disagree with the overwhelming scientific evidence on climate change.
[00:27:56.604 --> 00:28:06.253]  But there he is being laughed at.
[00:28:06.253 --> 00:28:13.480]  And then Pelosi and Biden behind him laugh too so that viewers just think it's all a joke about something.
[00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:16.924]  You know, they just laugh along with him.
[00:28:16.924 --> 00:28:17.644]  But here's the deal.
[00:28:17.644 --> 00:28:18.926]  They can't pass it to the Senate.
[00:28:19.827 --> 00:28:31.896]  They couldn't pass it internationally by treaty, so he's just ordered the EPA, criminally, to declare carbon dioxide that plants breathe, that plants live off of, that humans exhale, as a toxic waste.
[00:28:31.896 --> 00:28:40.842]  And they're going to come into Austin and shut down your jobs, and shut down, and this is happening all over the country.
[00:28:40.842 --> 00:28:42.884]  It is a criminal fraud.
[00:28:43.936 --> 00:28:46.037]  These people are criminals!
[00:28:46.037 --> 00:28:49.199]  There's open discussions of indicting Geithner.
[00:28:49.199 --> 00:28:52.241]  Open discussions of indictments of Pachauri.
[00:28:52.241 --> 00:28:53.241]  Open discussion.
[00:28:53.241 --> 00:28:55.543]  People know it's criminal.
[00:28:55.543 --> 00:28:58.084]  I'm not the only one pointing out this is criminal.
[00:28:58.084 --> 00:29:07.550]  It came out in a bunch of mainstream papers that the main Climate UN facility at East Anglia London, East Anglia England,
[00:29:09.204 --> 00:29:13.046]  is in deep trouble and criminally blocked the release of their files.
[00:29:13.046 --> 00:29:22.890]  This is a criminal enterprise to shut down and take control of your resources and to decide who can have a business and who has what taxes put on them.
[00:29:22.890 --> 00:29:26.772]  A total takeover and they're not stopping.
[00:29:26.772 --> 00:29:32.755]  We're having victories but they're still moving forward and if we stand up and fight them, we can beat them.
[00:29:34.588 --> 00:29:36.649]  Big report on this coming up from Paul Watson.
[00:29:36.649 --> 00:29:38.450]  Now, I haven't even gotten all the top stories.
[00:29:38.450 --> 00:29:38.910]  Stay with us.
[00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:42.172]  We'll cover them after this quick break right here on GCN.
[00:29:42.172 --> 00:29:45.174]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:29:45.174 --> 00:29:50.997]  Stay with us.
[00:29:50.997 --> 00:29:52.378]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.378 --> 00:29:54.919]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.919 --> 00:29:57.601]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.359 --> 00:30:01.521]  What's your home worth?

[00:31:01.748 --> 00:31:05.769]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:31:05.769 --> 00:31:09.010]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:31:09.010 --> 00:31:10.431]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[00:31:11.135 --> 00:31:13.798]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:31:13.798 --> 00:31:20.204]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:31:20.204 --> 00:31:25.749]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:31:25.749 --> 00:31:35.378]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:31:35.498 --> 00:31:37.839]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:31:37.839 --> 00:31:39.419]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:31:39.419 --> 00:31:41.880]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:43.720]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:49.162]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:31:49.162 --> 00:31:54.163]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[00:32:00.256 --> 00:32:01.056]  Hi, everyone.
[00:32:01.056 --> 00:32:02.117]  Andy Anderson here.
[00:32:02.117 --> 00:32:06.518]  Are you using those little bottles of hand gel that kill germs, bacteria, and other nasties?
[00:32:06.518 --> 00:32:12.300]  In today's world, that's smart, especially with the filthy doorknobs, shopping carts, and handrails we touch every day.
[00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:16.661]  Did you know that once the alcohol evaporates in a few seconds, goodbye effectiveness?
[00:32:16.661 --> 00:32:18.342]  No more protection till you use it again.
[00:32:18.502 --> 00:32:19.863]  PureWorks to the rescue!
[00:32:19.863 --> 00:32:24.248]  Our FDA-compliant foam, lotion, soap, and spray do not contain alcohol.
[00:32:24.248 --> 00:32:26.450]  Their killing power lasts up to four hours.

[00:32:38.481 --> 00:32:39.522]  Moles and fungus, too.

[00:32:41.144 --> 00:32:44.326]  You'll love how your skin feels with PureWorks Soft and Supple.
[00:32:44.326 --> 00:32:45.507]  No more dry skin.
[00:32:45.507 --> 00:32:50.090]  Here's to a little peace of mind knowing that your hands are still germ-free hours later.
[00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:57.275]  Call now toll-free 888-245-0300 to get your hands on PureWorks and get PureWorks on your hands.
[00:32:57.275 --> 00:32:57.555]  That's 888-245-0300.
[00:33:07.771 --> 00:33:12.333]  Yes, we rallied the troops and annihilated Copenhagen.
[00:33:12.333 --> 00:33:21.878]  The hoax that man is evil and that carbon dioxide that we exhale is a toxic chemical weapon is imploding.
[00:33:21.878 --> 00:33:31.122]  But the enemy has invested hundreds of billions of dollars conservatively in this fraud, in this brainwashing operation, and they're not going to back off.
[00:33:31.122 --> 00:33:33.564]  We're winning the fight, but we've got to continue the fight
[00:33:34.384 --> 00:33:38.726]  It's, you know, it's like halftime and we're 21 points ahead of the enemy.
[00:33:38.726 --> 00:33:44.710]  But they've got a whole other half coming up and they're coming out of their dugout.
[00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:48.032]  They're coming out of their locker room ready for war.
[00:33:48.032 --> 00:33:50.033]  The empire is striking back.
[00:33:50.033 --> 00:33:58.637]  T-minus 30 minutes, Paul Watson tells me, on this key article exposing the local takeover of government.
[00:33:58.637 --> 00:34:01.139]  And it's completely illegal under federal and state law.
[00:34:02.196 --> 00:34:06.221]  They openly announced Austin has sister cities in the U.N.
[00:34:06.221 --> 00:34:08.824]  Austin gets awards from the U.N.
[00:34:08.824 --> 00:34:11.608]  as well as other cities falling under this control.
[00:34:11.608 --> 00:34:18.977]  And Schwarzenegger, that evil tyrant, that usurper, that outlander, that outlander is just out of control.
[00:34:19.898 --> 00:34:23.500]  All right, massive key info here in just a moment.
[00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:34.184]  We are carrying more and more books, more and more videos discounted out of the gates at the online video bookstore slash patriot apparel store at InfoWars.com.
[00:34:34.184 --> 00:34:39.667]  You can also write to us or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:34:39.667 --> 00:34:44.489]  Tex Mars has put out several big coffee table books that are so informative.
[00:34:45.089 --> 00:34:49.555]  He sent me a pre-copy about a month ago before it was out, and I couldn't put it down.
[00:34:49.555 --> 00:34:51.277]  It's called Conspiracy World.
[00:34:51.277 --> 00:34:56.624]  It's a big coffee table book, full of photos, very easy read, great to wake people up.
[00:34:56.624 --> 00:34:59.127]  It covers every subject under the sun.
[00:34:59.127 --> 00:35:03.492]  It's an encyclopedia on over a hundred subjects.
[00:35:04.545 --> 00:35:06.446]  You name it, this covers it.
[00:35:06.446 --> 00:35:08.548]  This is a great gift to give people.
[00:35:08.548 --> 00:35:10.329]  A great coffee table book.
[00:35:10.329 --> 00:35:12.771]  Great to give your friends and family if you want to wake them up.
[00:35:12.771 --> 00:35:14.292]  Sure, you know about the New World Order.
[00:35:14.292 --> 00:35:18.215]  A lot of you know more than I do, but your friends, your family, your neighbors don't.
[00:35:18.215 --> 00:35:20.997]  We have it discounted out of the gates at InfoWars.com.
[00:35:20.997 --> 00:35:21.977]  This just came out.
[00:35:21.977 --> 00:35:23.879]  We just got this two days ago.
[00:35:23.879 --> 00:35:25.320]  We have it ready to ship.
[00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:27.441]  Conspiracy World.
[00:35:27.441 --> 00:35:29.463]  Giant coffee table book.
[00:35:30.203 --> 00:35:32.826]  And most people are selling it for $35.
[00:35:32.826 --> 00:35:38.230]  It's 24.95 at Infowars.com.
[00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:42.234]  Also, you can pre-order How Weed Won the West.
[00:35:42.234 --> 00:35:44.176]  And we're making a new trailer for this today.
[00:35:44.176 --> 00:35:46.298]  I've been involved in consulting, but...
[00:35:47.421 --> 00:35:52.365]  The current trailer, I don't think, really telegraphs what the film covers.
[00:35:52.365 --> 00:35:54.006]  This is about states' rights.
[00:35:54.006 --> 00:36:02.171]  This is about how the government wants to keep drugs illegal, especially marijuana, because they are laundering the money from the illegal sale of drugs.
[00:36:02.171 --> 00:36:09.517]  And that when you decriminalize, just like when they decriminalized alcohol and prohibition, you have less alcoholism.
[00:36:09.517 --> 00:36:10.958]  The mafia doesn't get the money.
[00:36:10.958 --> 00:36:12.479]  The police aren't as corrupt.
[00:36:12.479 --> 00:36:15.881]  That's when they made a bunch of drugs illegal, is when they lost alcohol prohibition in 1930.
[00:36:17.466 --> 00:36:21.115]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, how we'd won the West, get it first.
[00:36:22.873 --> 00:36:24.674]  Out of the gates, pre-order it.
[00:36:24.674 --> 00:36:28.296]  It ships the 15th of February.
[00:36:28.296 --> 00:36:29.876]  16-17 days from now.
[00:36:29.876 --> 00:36:32.598]  Pre-order at InfoWars.com.
[00:36:32.598 --> 00:36:41.482]  We've also got scores of combos and specials where you can get a free t-shirt when you order a video, or buy one video, get the next video half-priced.
[00:36:41.482 --> 00:36:46.004]  We've got deals where you can get loose change final cut for $5 apiece.
[00:36:46.004 --> 00:36:46.965]  That's in the hard case.
[00:36:48.285 --> 00:36:50.506]  I mean, you can't beat that.
[00:36:50.506 --> 00:36:55.787]  We have slashed prices down to absolutely nothing to get the word out at Infowars.com.
[00:36:55.787 --> 00:36:57.727]  You can also write to us at P.O.
[00:36:57.727 --> 00:36:58.147]  Box 19549.
[00:36:58.147 --> 00:36:58.648]  That's P.O.
[00:36:58.648 --> 00:36:59.308]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas 78760.
[00:36:59.308 --> 00:36:59.648]  Again, P.O.
[00:36:59.648 --> 00:37:00.268]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas 78760.
[00:37:09.508 --> 00:37:12.509]  And your purchase of the books, the videos, the materials gets the word out.
[00:37:12.509 --> 00:37:22.831]  It was very exciting at that gun rally on Monday to see around 80% of the people wearing Obama Joker shirts, InfoWars.com shirts.
[00:37:22.831 --> 00:37:29.433]  That's how you meet like-minded people when you're on the street.
[00:37:33.055 --> 00:37:39.577]  That's how, when you go to the restaurant, or the bar, or to work, or to church, you meet like-minded people.
[00:37:39.577 --> 00:37:40.838]  The Don't Tread On Me shirts.
[00:37:40.838 --> 00:37:42.919]  I mean, we've got close to a hundred t-shirts now.
[00:37:42.919 --> 00:37:49.281]  We just added a bunch of new designs, and your purchase of the t-shirts also makes this radio broadcast possible.
[00:37:49.941 --> 00:37:54.724]  Bumper stickers, Constitution, Citizen Rule books, all available.
[00:37:54.724 --> 00:37:57.666]  Every order, by the way, gets a free one of those and free bumper stickers.
[00:37:57.666 --> 00:37:59.727]  Infowars.com.
[00:37:59.727 --> 00:38:04.169]  And don't forget, a $5.95 membership at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:38:04.169 --> 00:38:05.850]  All 24 of my films.
[00:38:05.850 --> 00:38:10.873]  Get to watch the live streaming video of the radio show.
[00:38:10.873 --> 00:38:12.174]  We're doing three hours today.
[00:38:12.174 --> 00:38:13.154]  $5.95, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:38:17.489 --> 00:38:20.091]  And again, I want to thank all the PrisonPlanet.TV members.
[00:38:20.091 --> 00:38:23.034]  You have made so much of what we do here possible.
[00:38:23.034 --> 00:38:25.436]  Okay.
[00:38:25.436 --> 00:38:28.298]  We got Dean Haglin coming up in studio.
[00:38:28.298 --> 00:38:29.619]  We got Bob Chapman coming up.
[00:38:29.619 --> 00:38:31.200]  We got Dr. Tim Ball.
[00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:33.122]  It's all coming up today.
[00:38:33.122 --> 00:38:37.566]  But I want to now blitz through the news.
[00:38:37.566 --> 00:38:38.346]  Finishing up,
[00:38:39.266 --> 00:38:56.313]  This hour, with the discussion we've been having about the international crime syndicate, the banks, setting up neo-feudalism, literally deciding who can have a business, who can't, a whole new grid of taxes and bureaucrats and inspectors and control, and how we're fighting it.
[00:38:56.313 --> 00:39:02.135]  Meanwhile, they have this newest ridiculous propaganda.
[00:39:02.135 --> 00:39:06.357]  I told you a few months ago that Obama's approval rating was plunging in free fall.
[00:39:07.509 --> 00:39:22.195]  And that as soon as they reintroduced more fake Bin Laden videos and audios, and some fake staged terror attacks, that that would herald the preparation for Obama to start mimicking Bush with the police state.
[00:39:22.195 --> 00:39:27.718]  And he's been continuing the secret arrests, the torture, the rendition, expanding the wars.
[00:39:27.718 --> 00:39:30.459]  Right on time, the staged underwear bombing.
[00:39:30.459 --> 00:39:32.840]  Clearly staged, proven in triplicate.
[00:39:34.292 --> 00:39:36.274]  Right on time, the naked body scanners.
[00:39:36.274 --> 00:39:39.096]  Right on time.
[00:39:39.096 --> 00:39:42.218]  Obama says, Al-Qaeda's gonna hit us, it's gonna be bigger than 9-11.
[00:39:42.218 --> 00:39:46.701]  The Pentagon says, we'll have to have martial law for your safety.
[00:39:46.701 --> 00:39:49.944]  Then they start putting out fake Bin Laden tapes every week.
[00:39:49.944 --> 00:39:53.226]  He put out one two weeks ago.
[00:39:53.226 --> 00:40:01.532]  They put out a new one yesterday, and this is so asinine, the Associated Press runs the deceptive headline, Bin Laden blasts U.S.
[00:40:01.532 --> 00:40:02.553]  for climate change.
[00:40:05.276 --> 00:40:20.529]  And the last line of this 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 paragraph article, no journalistic integrity, total fraud, a high school newspaper wouldn't allow this.
[00:40:20.529 --> 00:40:22.871]  But the AP does it.
[00:40:22.871 --> 00:40:27.035]  The new message, whose authenticity could not immediately be confirmed,
[00:40:28.001 --> 00:40:33.907]  Comes after a Bin Laden tape released last week, which they said was unconfirmed, now they just slip it in.
[00:40:33.907 --> 00:40:37.330]  Oh, they don't say it was confirmed, they just say another Bin Laden tape.
[00:40:37.330 --> 00:40:38.911]  So that's deceptive right there.
[00:40:38.911 --> 00:40:44.156]  This is the worst journalism you can imagine.
[00:40:44.156 --> 00:40:53.545]  The new message, whose authenticity could not immediately be confirmed, comes after a Bin Laden tape released last week, in which he endorsed a failed attempt to blow up an American airline on Christmas Day.
[00:40:56.001 --> 00:41:07.603]  They release these on message boards, and every time linguists in major universities listen to the recordings, they've said over and over again, it isn't the same dialect, it isn't bin Laden.
[00:41:07.603 --> 00:41:20.205]  They can take real audio videotapes of him, they've created a voice print identification key, it's 100%, and they test the new tapes against the voice print.
[00:41:20.205 --> 00:41:22.706]  It won't unlock the voice key, but it's worse.
[00:41:23.951 --> 00:41:29.696]  Linguists listen, and over and over again, every tape is a different voice, a different dialect.
[00:41:29.696 --> 00:41:38.965]  Some they say are someone from Saudi Arabia, someone from Italy, someone from Central Europe, someone from North America, US or Canada.
[00:41:38.965 --> 00:41:40.186]  Faking!
[00:41:40.186 --> 00:41:42.328]  It isn't even a real Arab!
[00:41:45.379 --> 00:41:48.020]  It isn't even the same dialect.
[00:41:48.020 --> 00:42:01.444]  That'd be like if somebody put out a tape, and people that know how to listen to it in English, if they put out a fake Alex Jones tape, and on the tape it was, I am Alex Jones.
[00:42:01.444 --> 00:42:03.244]  I am going to get you.
[00:42:03.244 --> 00:42:05.165]  I am going to carry out attacks.
[00:42:06.089 --> 00:42:14.154]  And then they put it out, and people that are from Texas, linguists, people that understand dialect, listen to it, and they go, well that isn't even someone from the Middle East.
[00:42:14.154 --> 00:42:16.956]  This is completely fake.
[00:42:16.956 --> 00:42:18.737]  That's how dumb they think you are.
[00:42:18.737 --> 00:42:27.122]  People that know the dialect and know Bin Laden's speech inflections listen to it, and it isn't even close!
[00:42:27.122 --> 00:42:30.664]  And they admit it's fake!
[00:42:30.664 --> 00:42:33.686]  I mean, this is so outrageous.
[00:42:34.895 --> 00:42:39.536]  So unbelievably ridiculous on its face.
[00:42:39.536 --> 00:42:44.218]  But in the first seven paragraphs, it's Bin Laden's gonna get us.
[00:42:44.218 --> 00:42:52.280]  And Bin Laden's upset about the evil carbon dioxide.
[00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:57.801]  And he's gonna attack us because we won't go along with the carbon tax.
[00:42:57.801 --> 00:42:59.922]  Even terrorists know the right thing to do.
[00:43:01.837 --> 00:43:14.583]  This admitted CIA asset, dead for at least eight years, according to mainstream media reports, totally... I mean, it is a joke of jokes of jokes.
[00:43:14.583 --> 00:43:16.583]  Bin Laden blasts U.S.
[00:43:16.583 --> 00:43:17.644]  for climate change.
[00:43:20.575 --> 00:43:27.939]  Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden has called for the world to boycott American goods and the U.S.
[00:43:27.939 --> 00:43:35.722]  dollar, blaming the United States and other industrialized countries for global warming, according to a new audio tape released Friday.
[00:43:35.722 --> 00:43:40.425]  Oh my gosh!
[00:43:40.425 --> 00:43:49.009]  In the tape, broadcast in part on Al Jazeera television, bin Laden warned of the dangers of climate change and says that the way to stop it is to bring the wheels of American economy to a halt.
[00:43:50.495 --> 00:43:52.735]  Which is what the climate legislation would do.
[00:43:52.735 --> 00:43:55.736]  Which is what the banks want, the UN wants, and Maury Strong wants.
[00:43:55.736 --> 00:44:01.097]  He blamed Western industrialized nations for hunger, deforestation, and floods across the globe.
[00:44:01.097 --> 00:44:08.779]  Yeah, they're now saying the earthquake, not just Danny Glover, but the UN is saying the earthquake was caused by it.
[00:44:08.779 --> 00:44:13.960]  I mean, no one in any scientific field says that the atmosphere causes earthquakes.
[00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:16.881]  They don't care, they're teaching it to school kids right now.
[00:44:16.881 --> 00:44:18.921]  I've got confirmed reports we covered yesterday.
[00:44:21.795 --> 00:44:27.580]  And the day before, where they're now teaching that the earthquake happened because you won't pay taxes to George Soros.
[00:44:27.580 --> 00:44:32.143]  I mean, this is a joke of a joke of a fraud.
[00:44:32.143 --> 00:44:40.250]  I mean, it's so... It's like them teaching school kids that polar bears can't swim and are all dying when their numbers are exploding.
[00:44:40.250 --> 00:44:43.232]  I mean, it's just, it's a fact their numbers are exploding.
[00:44:43.232 --> 00:44:47.596]  But they think you're so stupid.
[00:44:47.596 --> 00:44:50.078]  They think you're dumber than dirt.
[00:44:51.462 --> 00:44:57.126]  They think you are complete morons!
[00:44:57.126 --> 00:44:57.927]  Why not?
[00:44:57.927 --> 00:45:03.351]  Almost everybody Mark Dice talked to in San Diego read a petition to ban free speech in the First Amendment.
[00:45:03.351 --> 00:45:06.693]  And he said, shut up everyone that criticizes Obama.
[00:45:06.693 --> 00:45:09.435]  It was clear and they said, yes sir!
[00:45:09.435 --> 00:45:11.096]  And let's shut down your jobs!
[00:45:11.096 --> 00:45:11.957]  Oh yes!
[00:45:11.957 --> 00:45:12.998]  And tax me!
[00:45:12.998 --> 00:45:14.139]  Tax me more!
[00:45:14.139 --> 00:45:16.620]  I'm an idiot!
[00:45:16.620 --> 00:45:18.482]  We've got to reach out to these idiots!
[00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:24.003]  These idiot fake right-wingers that think there are all these real terrorists that want to attack us.
[00:45:24.003 --> 00:45:30.967]  These idiot leftists that think in Austin, the city council's stealing property and then openly giving it to former mayors.
[00:45:30.967 --> 00:45:33.888]  I mean, it's just lawless criminality out in the open.
[00:45:33.888 --> 00:45:37.591]  What do you expect is going to happen when you let these kind of things go on?
[00:45:37.591 --> 00:45:41.973]  What do you expect, people?
[00:45:41.973 --> 00:45:44.134]  Grow up!
[00:45:44.134 --> 00:45:45.375]  We've got so many new listeners.
[00:45:45.375 --> 00:45:48.597]  I'm talking to the new people listening that think this show's a joke.
[00:45:53.035 --> 00:45:57.999]  And at the end, they say the whole time it's really Bin Laden, with no attribution, where it came from.
[00:45:57.999 --> 00:45:58.940]  They're just training you.
[00:45:58.940 --> 00:46:02.462]  And at the end they say, oh, we have no idea this is even real.
[00:46:02.462 --> 00:46:10.989]  I mean, I could literally read Arabic in some fake message and put it out, but I guarantee you they would come arrest me.
[00:46:10.989 --> 00:46:12.971]  But I could do it just to illustrate.
[00:46:12.971 --> 00:46:14.332]  They'd find some law.
[00:46:14.332 --> 00:46:19.696]  Like the guy five years ago that did the fake beheading in his garage in San Francisco to illustrate how stupid it is.
[00:46:19.696 --> 00:46:21.017]  The media ran with that.
[00:46:21.017 --> 00:46:22.138]  Oh, look, a new beheading!
[00:46:29.738 --> 00:46:33.441]  There is no end to it.
[00:46:33.441 --> 00:46:36.063]  Ten years ago, they didn't have AP reports like this.
[00:46:36.063 --> 00:46:42.968]  Again, journalism in high school is better than this.
[00:46:42.968 --> 00:46:48.912]  I mean, I could literally sit here and go, This is Osama bin Laden.
[00:46:48.912 --> 00:46:52.394]  I am speaking to you in English.
[00:46:52.394 --> 00:46:58.499]  Do whatever Ben Bernanke says, or I will send space aliens to get you.
[00:47:00.578 --> 00:47:03.440]  I mean, is there nothing people won't buy?
[00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:08.343]  Is there nothing?
[00:47:08.343 --> 00:47:10.284]  Okay, getting into the banking scam.
[00:47:10.284 --> 00:47:11.345]  You know the bad news.
[00:47:11.345 --> 00:47:21.591]  You know that Ben Bernanke was reconfirmed to the chairmanship of the Federal Reserve.
[00:47:21.591 --> 00:47:25.474]  Chuckie Schumer said, because he did such a great job and so he can save our economy.
[00:47:25.474 --> 00:47:25.854]  Oh, yes.
[00:47:27.620 --> 00:47:37.804]  After they terrorized the public in October of 2008 saying, give us all these new funds, give us unlimited trillions or there'll be a depression and then the economy plunged.
[00:47:37.804 --> 00:47:40.005]  That's financial terrorism.
[00:47:40.005 --> 00:47:41.106]  Totally illegal.
[00:47:41.106 --> 00:47:42.226]  Insider trading.
[00:47:42.226 --> 00:47:44.387]  Total manipulation of markets out in the open.
[00:47:45.848 --> 00:47:50.412]  But that's okay, because I don't want him to just be shunned and just be thrown under the bus.
[00:47:50.412 --> 00:47:52.314]  We want his bosses to go to prison.
[00:47:52.314 --> 00:47:58.479]  And Geithner is in trouble, and there are calls for him to resign, and it will only get worse as the economy gets worse.
[00:47:58.479 --> 00:48:11.190]  Meanwhile, Paulson in testimony, we've got this coming up later in the broadcast, Paulson in testimony, I sent you guys that video of Paulson, do you have it, where he said the Russians were planning
[00:48:13.643 --> 00:48:21.948]  Do you have the Paulson video I sent you where they said that the Russians were planning to drive down our economy and that's why they had to have the banker bailout?
[00:48:21.948 --> 00:48:23.709]  It was the evil Russians.
[00:48:23.709 --> 00:48:24.910]  It wasn't the bankers.
[00:48:24.910 --> 00:48:25.730]  It wasn't J.P.
[00:48:25.730 --> 00:48:26.511]  Morgan.
[00:48:26.511 --> 00:48:28.092]  It wasn't Goldman Sachs.
[00:48:28.092 --> 00:48:32.355]  If you don't have that, I sent you the article in the video.
[00:48:32.355 --> 00:48:34.816]  Okay, good, because I want to play that later.
[00:48:34.816 --> 00:48:38.778]  But here is the big news.
[00:48:38.778 --> 00:48:40.900]  Here is the big story.
[00:48:43.066 --> 00:48:48.669]  This is on PrisonPlanet.com by Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:48:48.669 --> 00:48:49.589]  Go there now.
[00:48:49.589 --> 00:48:51.070]  Get this article.
[00:48:51.070 --> 00:48:53.011]  Get it out to everyone.
[00:48:53.011 --> 00:48:57.033]  Because what does New York Mayor Bloomberg have to say?
[00:48:57.033 --> 00:48:58.734]  Headline, Bloomberg!
[00:48:58.734 --> 00:49:04.037]  There may be a secret banking cabal that does run the world after all.
[00:49:06.038 --> 00:49:09.879]  He's now giving an interview to his own publication, Bloomberg.
[00:49:09.879 --> 00:49:13.180]  See, we have forced them to admit all this is real.
[00:49:13.180 --> 00:49:15.040]  And now he's getting ready to run for president.
[00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:17.541]  He understands people know the real enemy is the banks.
[00:49:17.541 --> 00:49:25.683]  And so Bloomberg, funded by these people, is going to play games like Glenn Beck and Governor Perry and claim he's a patriot.
[00:49:25.683 --> 00:49:28.284]  Hey, at least he's admitting it.
[00:49:28.284 --> 00:49:31.004]  That goes a long way to identifying the real government.
[00:49:31.004 --> 00:49:33.465]  Because they may fool us another time with Bloomberg coming up.
[00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:36.141]  They know people don't want Republicans or Democrats.
[00:49:36.141 --> 00:49:39.402]  He may run for president as an independent.
[00:49:39.402 --> 00:49:44.345]  Because now, it will be openly discussed that the real government is the banks.
[00:49:44.345 --> 00:49:45.005]  Bloomberg!
[00:49:45.005 --> 00:49:47.786]  Maybe a secret banking cabal does run the world after all.
[00:49:47.786 --> 00:49:55.350]  In another measure of how what the establishment labels conspiracy theory is quickly becoming mainstream, Bloomberg News carries a story today acknowledging that those
[00:49:56.550 --> 00:50:05.259]  To write it as crazy for warning that the world is run by secret banking cabal have largely been proven right in the light of the AIG cover-up.
[00:50:05.259 --> 00:50:11.666]  I mean, how many leaders of the Republican Democratic Party in Congress, countless, have said the banks run America?
[00:50:11.666 --> 00:50:13.728]  I mean, they are the economy.
[00:50:13.728 --> 00:50:14.789]  They're stealing everything.
[00:50:14.789 --> 00:50:15.890]  They're parasites.
[00:50:15.890 --> 00:50:18.713]  It's like a 10-pound dog dragging a 30-pound tick around.
[00:50:20.814 --> 00:50:26.058]  The tech owns the television and the media and tells you how much you need him.
[00:50:26.058 --> 00:50:28.700]  This is a quote from Bloomberg.
[00:50:28.700 --> 00:50:38.927]  The idea of a secret banking cabal that controls the country and global economy are given among conspiracy theories who stockpile ammo, bottled water, and peanut butter.
[00:50:38.927 --> 00:50:47.273]  After this week's congressional hearing into the bailout of American International Group, Inc., you have to wonder if these folks are crazy after all.
[00:50:47.273 --> 00:50:48.274]  That's from Bloomberg.
[00:50:49.341 --> 00:50:52.543]  From Bloomberg Publication.
[00:50:52.543 --> 00:50:54.144]  What do you mean?
[00:50:54.144 --> 00:50:55.024]  It's not secret.
[00:50:55.024 --> 00:50:57.205]  They're openly announcing world government.
[00:50:57.205 --> 00:50:58.726]  The UN's openly announcing it.
[00:50:58.726 --> 00:50:59.887]  We're just reporting the facts.
[00:51:01.229 --> 00:51:04.611]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[00:51:04.611 --> 00:51:08.513]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[00:51:08.513 --> 00:51:12.234]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[00:51:12.234 --> 00:51:19.718]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey Water Filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride, and contaminants.
[00:51:19.778 --> 00:51:20.078]  I think so.

[00:51:56.131 --> 00:52:02.255]  That's 1-877-99-BERKEY today.
[00:52:02.255 --> 00:52:06.277]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:52:06.277 --> 00:52:09.539]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:52:09.539 --> 00:52:10.960]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[00:52:11.630 --> 00:52:14.313]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:52:14.313 --> 00:52:20.699]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:52:20.699 --> 00:52:25.763]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:52:25.763 --> 00:52:35.893]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:52:35.993 --> 00:52:38.355]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:52:38.355 --> 00:52:39.937]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:52:39.937 --> 00:52:42.399]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:52:42.399 --> 00:52:44.521]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:52:44.521 --> 00:52:49.686]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:52:49.686 --> 00:52:58.795]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:53:01.144 --> 00:53:08.430]  For the first time ever, the makers of Alpine Air Foods have approved an incredible sale with savings only available through ready-made resources.
[00:53:08.430 --> 00:53:13.534]  For a limited time, save 25% off all cases of freeze-dried foods by Alpine Air.
[00:53:13.534 --> 00:53:17.217]  Yes, 25% off on case lots only of Alpine Air Foods.
[00:53:17.217 --> 00:53:19.659]  Only available at readymaderesources.com.
[00:53:19.659 --> 00:53:22.141]  Mix and match as much as you want to best suit your needs.
[00:53:22.301 --> 00:53:22.922]  We're good to go.
[00:53:37.338 --> 00:53:38.019]  We're good to go.
[00:54:13.188 --> 00:54:26.212]  Tell all the folks around the world their enemy isn't Catholics, it isn't black people, it isn't Chinese, it isn't Jews, it isn't Buddhist, it isn't Christians.
[00:54:26.212 --> 00:54:27.312]  It's the bankers.
[00:54:27.312 --> 00:54:29.153]  It's the money changers.
[00:54:29.153 --> 00:54:31.834]  It's the New World Order.
[00:54:31.834 --> 00:54:33.534]  It's the system.
[00:54:33.534 --> 00:54:42.437]  And we can all agree with dismantling this parasite system that has bought off governments and given itself
[00:54:43.447 --> 00:54:48.969]  The power to create unlimited fiat currency and credit to take over our society.
[00:54:48.969 --> 00:54:55.692]  They've already created thousands and thousands of times more money than there is assets in the world.
[00:54:55.692 --> 00:54:57.973]  That's conservative.
[00:54:57.973 --> 00:55:04.195]  Hundreds of times the total GDP and complete assets.
[00:55:04.195 --> 00:55:05.516]  Some estimates are in the thousands.
[00:55:07.441 --> 00:55:11.123]  And so now they want to use fake environmentalism to take over your life.
[00:55:11.123 --> 00:55:19.226]  Now they want to use that to shut down everything, to bankrupt you, so they can have an organized neo-feudalistic society.
[00:55:19.226 --> 00:55:24.669]  And I wanted to play this clip of Dick Morris in front of Sean Hannity, who's done more than anybody.
[00:55:27.154 --> 00:55:35.098]  In fake right-wing conservative media to say there's no such thing as a new world order, global government, and that the Federal Reserve isn't private.
[00:55:35.098 --> 00:55:37.539]  And boy, he turned red when Dick Morris told the truth.
[00:55:37.539 --> 00:55:38.139]  Play that clip.
[00:55:41.184 --> 00:55:48.968]  There is a big thing that's going to happen in London at this G20, and then they're hiding it, they're camouflaging it, they're not talking about it.
[00:55:48.968 --> 00:55:51.910]  Coordination of international regulation.
[00:55:51.910 --> 00:55:58.974]  What they are going to do is to put our Fed and our SEC under the control, in effect, of the IMF.
[00:55:58.974 --> 00:55:59.574]  Oh, come on.
[00:55:59.574 --> 00:56:00.435]  You believe they'll do this?
[00:56:00.435 --> 00:56:02.636]  That's what was in the draft agenda.
[00:56:02.636 --> 00:56:05.397]  They call it coordination of regulation.
[00:56:05.397 --> 00:56:09.660]  What it really is, is putting the American economy under international regulation.
[00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:14.763]  And those people who have been yelling, oh, the UN's going to take over, global government.
[00:56:14.763 --> 00:56:16.003]  Conspiracy theorists.
[00:56:16.003 --> 00:56:18.685]  They've been crazy, but now they're right.
[00:56:18.685 --> 00:56:20.286]  It's happening.
[00:56:20.286 --> 00:56:28.970]  When Geithner said he would be open to the idea of a global currency last week, those conspiracy people had said and suggested that for years.
[00:56:28.970 --> 00:56:29.571]  You're not wrong.
[00:56:29.571 --> 00:56:30.251]  You're not wrong.
[00:56:32.032 --> 00:56:39.160]  What they always do at these conferences is they have the center show is here, and the side show they don't want you to pay attention to.
[00:56:39.160 --> 00:56:42.344]  The center show is the size of the stimulus packages.
[00:56:42.344 --> 00:56:49.652]  The real show is international regulation of the financial institutions, which is going to happen under the IMF control.
[00:56:49.652 --> 00:56:53.136]  And remember, the IMF is run by Europeans, the World Bank by Americans.
[00:56:55.097 --> 00:57:07.561]  Let me ask you this, because we got the G20 Summit this week, and by the end of the week, folks, you're going to see the police, and the clubbings, and the beatings, and the tear gas is all coming, as it already started.
[00:57:07.561 --> 00:57:09.702]  His polls are dropping somewhat dramatically.
[00:57:09.702 --> 00:57:11.903]  We touched on it a little bit last week.
[00:57:11.903 --> 00:57:20.706]  So politically, as we begin the broader battle budget... I played that clip because I wanted to just remind you.
[00:57:20.706 --> 00:57:23.187]  All these years, while they were building the global government,
[00:57:24.326 --> 00:57:34.776]  Setting up the system, bankrupting the states, overrunning the nation with illegals to further bankrupt it and create a voting block they can use to vote for unconstitutional measures.
[00:57:34.776 --> 00:57:40.081]  They were there stalling you, stalling me.
[00:57:40.081 --> 00:57:41.923]  Saying it doesn't exist, doesn't exist.
[00:57:41.923 --> 00:57:42.984]  This is their favorite tactic.
[00:57:42.984 --> 00:57:46.887]  Remember three years ago when I had the heir to the Rothschild fortune on?
[00:57:46.887 --> 00:57:47.808]  He was promoting a book.
[00:57:47.808 --> 00:57:49.490]  We called up, got their publisher to get him on.
[00:57:51.144 --> 00:57:51.964]  Remember?
[00:57:51.964 --> 00:57:56.245]  And he said, there's no plan for a tax, there's no such thing as cap and trade.
[00:57:56.245 --> 00:58:00.046]  He owned the main bank two years before that, setting it up.
[00:58:00.046 --> 00:58:01.266]  He knew all about it.
[00:58:01.266 --> 00:58:14.009]  But he had such contempt and hatred for you, that David Rothschild, who's now on television calling for global governance and global taxes, told you it didn't exist.
[00:58:14.009 --> 00:58:16.310]  Now that they were given the green light to go completely public,
[00:58:17.827 --> 00:58:27.417]  He comes right out in the open and calls for global governance on Bloomberg a month ago at Copenhagen.
[00:58:27.417 --> 00:58:28.398]  It's the same thing.
[00:58:28.398 --> 00:58:30.280]  Sean Hannity, Limbaugh, all of them.
[00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:31.341]  There's no new world order.
[00:58:31.341 --> 00:58:32.082]  It doesn't exist.
[00:58:32.082 --> 00:58:34.044]  I heard Beck eight years ago saying that.
[00:58:34.044 --> 00:58:38.369]  Now they admit it exists, but don't worry, the Republicans will save you from it.
[00:58:38.369 --> 00:58:39.230]  No, they'll stall you.
[00:58:42.287 --> 00:58:44.916]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:59:55.780 --> 00:59:58.542]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.091 --> 01:00:09.933]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:09.933 --> 01:00:11.494]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.494 --> 01:00:12.434]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.434 --> 01:00:17.256]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.256 --> 01:00:21.298]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:37.335 --> 01:00:39.376]  Dean Haglund coming up in the next segment.
[01:00:39.376 --> 01:00:47.921]  He's going to be with us for an hour, five minutes into the next hour, then our once a week visit with Bob Chapman on the economy and what the New World Order is up to.
[01:00:47.921 --> 01:00:51.263]  We're going to simulcast for the last two hours and 52 minutes.
[01:00:51.263 --> 01:00:55.726]  So at the 8 after, in this hour, we're going to go live at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:00:55.726 --> 01:00:59.028]  If you want to see the TV show, the in-studio guests, the documents,
[01:00:59.828 --> 01:01:00.249]  I don't think so.
[01:01:19.540 --> 01:01:23.002]  Maybe a secret banking cabal does run the world after all.
[01:01:23.002 --> 01:01:26.424]  And Fox News saying it is a secret global banking cabal.
[01:01:26.424 --> 01:01:34.089]  And CNN saying, well, yeah, there's a global government banking cabal, but they want to take care of you.
[01:01:34.089 --> 01:01:38.171]  They want to help you.
[01:01:38.171 --> 01:01:40.813]  They know what they're doing.
[01:01:40.813 --> 01:01:42.774]  And so that's the spin.
[01:01:42.774 --> 01:01:44.435]  All these years they denied it.
[01:01:44.435 --> 01:01:46.196]  All these years they said it didn't exist.
[01:01:49.505 --> 01:01:56.369]  And now they just come out and say, you know what, it's a good thing and we need it.
[01:01:56.369 --> 01:02:00.651]  And when they tell you it's going to give you jobs, shutting down industry, it's the opposite.
[01:02:00.651 --> 01:02:04.853]  Just like their car bailout, paid to have GM move offshore.
[01:02:04.853 --> 01:02:05.914]  They are globalists.
[01:02:05.914 --> 01:02:07.015]  They are monopoly men.
[01:02:07.015 --> 01:02:09.076]  They want to destroy the economy.
[01:02:09.076 --> 01:02:10.917]  They want to bankrupt the dollar.
[01:02:10.917 --> 01:02:16.320]  Ron Paul yesterday, in an article Steve Watson wrote from the video of him on Cavuto, laid it out.
[01:02:17.193 --> 01:02:18.994]  It's premeditated.
[01:02:18.994 --> 01:02:20.595]  They are wreckers.
[01:02:20.595 --> 01:02:22.256]  What were wreckers?
[01:02:22.256 --> 01:02:45.991]  Well, all over the world and in ancient times and even into the last 200 years in England, they had city towns on dangerous shoals in England and France that would put up fake lighthouses at night to bring ships in on the rocks and under salvage laws, they were allowed to then come out, a lot of times not even save the drowning people, and then they would come out and salvage the ship's goods.
[01:02:47.219 --> 01:02:48.159]  And that's what they are.
[01:02:48.159 --> 01:02:49.780]  They are wreckers.
[01:02:49.780 --> 01:02:51.040]  They are feudal lords.
[01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:54.041]  They want you bankrupted so they can control your life.
[01:02:54.041 --> 01:02:56.221]  They say this is what they want.
[01:02:56.221 --> 01:03:00.583]  They say the carbon tax is to destroy the industrialized society.
[01:03:00.583 --> 01:03:04.344]  They admit they're your enemy in their own publications.
[01:03:04.344 --> 01:03:09.105]  Then they arrogantly deny it when they're on television, even when you have their own quotes and video clips.
[01:03:10.768 --> 01:03:15.293]  Meanwhile, Paulson got grilled, as you know, in the last two days in Congress.
[01:03:15.293 --> 01:03:20.800]  Now he has his own conspiracy theory, which the Russians have denied, and which the White House is not confirming.
[01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:25.285]  Paulson says Russia urged China to dump Fannie Freddie bonds.
[01:03:25.285 --> 01:03:30.852]  He says when he was in China during the Olympics, that he heard there was a Russian plan.
[01:03:32.455 --> 01:03:52.919]  Really, we have the Goldman Sachs documents that you headed up, that McClatchy Newspapers had a five-part series on, where Goldman Sachs, three years before that, three years before 2008, was planning to create a housing bubble, tell everybody to buy it, and then secretly betting against it, to, quote, destroy their competition to make hundreds of billions.
[01:03:52.919 --> 01:03:54.540]  I mean, isn't that funny?
[01:03:56.565 --> 01:03:58.206]  Isn't that interesting?
[01:03:58.206 --> 01:04:03.970]  I mean, we know who came out in October 2008 and said, the economy's dead, it's all over, oh my God, run for the hills.
[01:04:03.970 --> 01:04:12.876]  It was the bankers, it was Bernanke, it was Paulson, it was Geithner, to drive down the market further so when they got their bailout money, they could buy it up.
[01:04:12.876 --> 01:04:15.198]  And then he comes out and blames the Russians.
[01:04:17.725 --> 01:04:26.513]  The Russians own market plunged by over 60% during the 888 war, and CNN told you that Russia attacked Georgia.
[01:04:26.513 --> 01:04:28.375]  A complete fraud on its face!
[01:04:31.926 --> 01:04:36.627]  But despite rolling AIG criminal bailouts, Senate votes to reappoint Bernanke.
[01:04:36.627 --> 01:04:41.008]  Kirk Demmo, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:04:41.008 --> 01:04:42.488]  Dean Haglund coming up in studio.
[01:04:42.488 --> 01:04:48.650]  Don't forget, if you can't listen live or on the AM and FM shore of Internet Satellite, you can always listen to the free podcast.
[01:04:48.650 --> 01:04:59.452]  Just go to InfoWars.com, click on the listen page link, and it takes you to a page where you can get the free podcast delivered to your MP3, iPod, iPhone, when you want, listen to it how you want.
[01:05:00.387 --> 01:05:04.931]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:05:04.931 --> 01:05:05.852]  Number one.
[01:05:05.852 --> 01:05:09.275]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:05:09.275 --> 01:05:10.136]  Number two.
[01:05:10.136 --> 01:05:15.021]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:05:15.021 --> 01:05:15.762]  It's true.
[01:05:15.762 --> 01:05:20.326]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:05:20.626 --> 01:05:21.447]  Number 3.
[01:05:21.447 --> 01:05:25.029]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:05:25.029 --> 01:05:28.951]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:05:28.951 --> 01:05:29.751]  Number 4.
[01:05:29.751 --> 01:05:32.513]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:05:32.513 --> 01:05:36.195]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:05:36.195 --> 01:05:36.976]  Number 5.
[01:05:36.976 --> 01:05:41.118]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:05:41.118 --> 01:05:45.881]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:05:46.181 --> 01:05:50.343]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:50.343 --> 01:05:52.124]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:52.124 --> 01:05:54.385]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.

[01:06:00.851 --> 01:06:03.852]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:06:03.852 --> 01:06:09.174]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:06:09.174 --> 01:06:11.235]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:06:11.235 --> 01:06:16.237]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:06:16.237 --> 01:06:17.418]  How much do you want?
[01:06:17.418 --> 01:06:18.538]  When do you want it?
[01:06:18.538 --> 01:06:20.419]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:06:20.419 --> 01:06:21.499]  When will you need it?
[01:06:21.499 --> 01:06:23.700]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:06:23.700 --> 01:06:25.041]  Will there be any food?
[01:06:25.041 --> 01:06:26.562]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:06:26.562 --> 01:06:27.622]  If there's a quarantine,
[01:06:27.782 --> 01:06:29.103]  And you can't feed yourself?
[01:06:29.103 --> 01:06:31.826]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:06:31.826 --> 01:06:35.410]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:06:35.410 --> 01:06:39.234]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:06:39.234 --> 01:06:40.456]  How much will you need?
[01:06:40.456 --> 01:06:41.357]  We don't know.
[01:06:41.357 --> 01:06:42.478]  How much do you want?
[01:06:42.478 --> 01:06:43.219]  All you can get.
[01:06:43.219 --> 01:06:44.220]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:47.524]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:06:47.524 --> 01:06:49.326]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:06:49.326 --> 01:06:50.227]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[01:06:59.838 --> 01:07:03.941]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[01:07:03.941 --> 01:07:06.803]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[01:07:06.803 --> 01:07:08.904]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[01:07:08.904 --> 01:07:11.146]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[01:07:11.146 --> 01:07:12.807]  And it's available right now to you.
[01:07:12.807 --> 01:07:17.110]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[01:07:17.270 --> 01:07:19.833]  Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.
[01:07:19.833 --> 01:07:25.859]  Get your family off the grid today by ordering your own Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator for your home or business.
[01:07:25.859 --> 01:07:30.644]  Their best seller, the Ecola Blue 28, produces up to 7 gallons of water every day.
[01:07:30.644 --> 01:07:33.487]  The Ecola Blue 28 is easy to use and economical.
[01:07:33.487 --> 01:07:36.210]  Generate your own pure water from the humidity in the air.
[01:07:36.210 --> 01:07:37.551]  This system is free of chemicals.
[01:07:37.751 --> 01:07:40.593]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:19.635 --> 01:08:20.516]  Hello, my friends.
[01:08:20.516 --> 01:08:22.298]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:08:22.298 --> 01:08:27.542]  We've got two hours and 52 minutes left in this syndicated radio broadcast.
[01:08:27.542 --> 01:08:38.032]  Bob Chapman, the international forecaster, will be joining us in the next hour to break down what's happening with the economy and the New World Order, the private banking syndicate that is dominating and controlling our planet.
[01:08:38.712 --> 01:08:48.895]  I'm also going to be detailing a key article that just went up on PrisonPlanet.com that I worked on with Paul Watson at about 530 in the morning when I got up.
[01:08:48.895 --> 01:08:52.416]  Cap-and-trade scam to be enforced at state level.
[01:08:52.416 --> 01:09:00.298]  Individuals and businesses in Austin and a plethora of other states to be taxed for emissions of life-giving carbon dioxide.
[01:09:00.298 --> 01:09:05.400]  And it details how we may have defeated Copenhagen and exposed the fact that it was a pre-
[01:09:06.568 --> 01:09:21.691]  Meditated system to tax the pound and a half or so of carbon dioxide that humans exhale every day while ignoring all the other serious real environmental problems like genetic engineering, cross-species engineering, and other things that we talk
[01:09:22.111 --> 01:09:24.353]  Overfishing in the ocean, toxic waste dumping.
[01:09:24.353 --> 01:09:27.255]  That's why it's come out Enron developed a scam in the mid-90s.
[01:09:27.255 --> 01:09:30.117]  That's why it's come out actually Big Oil's funding it all.
[01:09:30.117 --> 01:09:34.181]  That's why Howard Dean and even Dennis Kucinich are against the government health care plan.
[01:09:34.181 --> 01:09:35.722]  They finally read the bill.
[01:09:35.722 --> 01:09:39.084]  It gives liability protection to the insurance companies and hospitals.
[01:09:39.084 --> 01:09:42.867]  It puts 40 plus billion dollars of taxes a year on Medicare and Medicaid.
[01:09:42.867 --> 01:09:44.529]  It cuts the services you get.
[01:09:45.149 --> 01:09:48.271]  And then actually jacks up the prices.
[01:09:48.271 --> 01:09:50.332]  So the banker bailout, a scam.
[01:09:50.332 --> 01:09:51.953]  The health care plan, a scam.
[01:09:51.953 --> 01:09:54.835]  The forced flu inoculation system, a scam.
[01:09:54.835 --> 01:10:03.581]  Now even the EU Commission says they bought off their leaders, paid them off, the vaccine's dangerous, the German government wouldn't even take the shots themselves.
[01:10:03.581 --> 01:10:04.822]  All of that is going on.
[01:10:05.322 --> 01:10:20.970]  So, but they don't care if we expose Copenhagen as a direct global tax to be paid to the IMF and World Bank, George Soros, the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, Pachari, head of the IPCC, Barack Obama, a lot of Republicans are involved.
[01:10:20.970 --> 01:10:21.531]  They don't care.
[01:10:21.531 --> 01:10:23.752]  They're now coming into the states, the counties, the cities.
[01:10:24.252 --> 01:10:24.633]  I don't think so.
[01:10:39.329 --> 01:10:40.290]  job they created
[01:10:55.410 --> 01:10:56.351]  Yeah, a long time ago.
[01:10:56.351 --> 01:11:00.816]  I got a call, he was going to be in Austin, came over to my house, interviewed me.
[01:11:00.816 --> 01:11:02.938]  So you've been working on this documentary for a long time.
[01:11:02.938 --> 01:11:05.421]  For those that don't know, he did an episode of Bones last week.
[01:11:05.421 --> 01:11:08.765]  He's been on literally dozens and dozens of movies, TV shows.
[01:11:08.765 --> 01:11:12.769]  Of course, one of the big stars on The X-Files and The Lone Gunman.
[01:11:13.650 --> 01:11:21.272]  And he's here with us, and he's making a documentary, I guess four years in the making, called The Truth is Out There.
[01:11:21.272 --> 01:11:23.872]  And so we're very, very honored to have Dean Hagelin here.
[01:11:23.872 --> 01:11:35.615]  And because I've got to leave early today for a bunch of other business I've got to do, we're going to conduct my interview with him, but also his interview with me, here on air together today.
[01:11:35.615 --> 01:11:39.396]  So we'll kind of have a double combo, kill two birds with one stone.
[01:11:39.396 --> 01:11:41.377]  But Dean Hagelin, it's great to have you here with us, my friend.
[01:11:41.377 --> 01:11:42.877]  Alex, great to see you again, my friend.
[01:11:43.377 --> 01:11:46.642]  I can't believe that's been four years ago that I came over to your house, right?
[01:11:46.642 --> 01:11:48.324]  That studio was in your, was it?
[01:11:48.324 --> 01:11:50.107]  Well, first you came to my house to interview me.
[01:11:50.107 --> 01:11:50.667]  Yeah.
[01:11:50.667 --> 01:11:53.091]  And then about two years later you came to my studio.
[01:11:53.091 --> 01:11:55.154]  Your first studio, which was a small one.
[01:11:55.154 --> 01:11:56.716]  And now look at this operation!
[01:11:56.716 --> 01:11:58.578]  This is very impressive to see how it grows.
[01:11:59.079 --> 01:12:00.900]  Well, we're building a TV studio next door.
[01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:01.660]  Are you kidding me?
[01:12:01.660 --> 01:12:03.001]  Yeah, it's a simple one, but yeah.
[01:12:03.001 --> 01:12:04.402]  Wow, that's impressive.
[01:12:04.402 --> 01:12:07.783]  But anyway, yeah, we're doing this documentary called The Truth is Out There.
[01:12:07.783 --> 01:12:13.246]  It's an exploration, you know, as I played a conspiracy theorist on The X-Files for 10 years.
[01:12:14.013 --> 01:12:21.560]  My life now has taken on to where I go to sci-fi conventions and stuff like that and people come up and tell me their conspiracy theories and experiences.
[01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:25.043]  So now we're traveling around the world and these people are coming up to me.
[01:12:25.043 --> 01:12:29.426]  And of course you're a big part of that because every time I've come on your show it's been fantastic.
[01:12:29.426 --> 01:12:30.047]  I've always loved it.
[01:12:30.047 --> 01:12:33.370]  I follow you online all the time.
[01:12:33.370 --> 01:12:35.732]  And I just want to know a bit about your background.
[01:12:35.732 --> 01:12:37.413]  I don't even know how you got to this place.
[01:12:37.413 --> 01:12:40.436]  How did it all start for you way back when?
[01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:48.085]  Sure, but I mean, I guess we can do the questions first for me, and then I've got questions for you and news items.
[01:12:48.085 --> 01:12:49.426]  Just do back and forth.
[01:12:49.426 --> 01:12:51.728]  Exactly, I want to get your take on it.
[01:12:51.728 --> 01:13:03.877]  Well, Dean, to answer your question, going back about 16 years ago, I had already read a lot of history books, so I knew how governments really operated from a wide-spectrum analysis of history.
[01:13:03.877 --> 01:13:05.638]  Did you go to U of T here in Austin?
[01:13:05.638 --> 01:13:09.962]  No, I went to community college and learned that they were propagandizing me there, because I'd read so much
[01:13:10.482 --> 01:13:13.683]  You know, famous history books even.
[01:13:13.683 --> 01:13:16.304]  It was totally different from what was being taught in school.
[01:13:16.304 --> 01:13:19.825]  I was being taught global government's good, the Second Amendment's bad.
[01:13:19.825 --> 01:13:22.466]  I was being taught a left-right paradigm.
[01:13:22.466 --> 01:13:31.609]  It didn't fit into anything that I had read previous to that hundred years, where people were taught liberty versus tyranny, freedom versus slavery.
[01:13:31.609 --> 01:13:36.030]  And I learned that the same interests were controlling both political parties in almost every nation.
[01:13:36.030 --> 01:13:38.491]  And so I went and started an AXS TV show.
[01:13:39.531 --> 01:13:40.532]  Fourteen years ago.
[01:13:40.532 --> 01:13:43.234]  And within six months I had a local radio show.
[01:13:43.234 --> 01:13:44.896]  They offered it to me.
[01:13:44.896 --> 01:13:47.078]  The program director saw the show and liked it.
[01:13:47.078 --> 01:13:49.820]  And then a few months later I was on two days a week.
[01:13:49.820 --> 01:13:53.123]  And then a few months later I was on seven days a week.
[01:13:53.123 --> 01:13:56.786]  And then I started self-syndicating my own radio show.
[01:13:56.786 --> 01:14:01.450]  And so for 13 years now I've been syndicated.
[01:14:02.631 --> 01:14:07.374]  To mom and pops and to underground AM and FM radio stations.
[01:14:07.374 --> 01:14:21.001]  And I started Infowars.com in 1998 and so we've had that for 12 years and it's gotten better and better and we just continue to slowly grow and slowly expand and slow and easy wins the race.
[01:14:21.001 --> 01:14:24.343]  Really not slow and easy, it's a hectic schedule.
[01:14:25.563 --> 01:14:33.948]  But still, we just continue our work to try to shatter the left-right paradigm, to get people to start thinking outside the box, and really looking at the official history.
[01:14:33.948 --> 01:14:41.272]  I mean, the elites admit what they've done in their own annals, their own documents, their own articles, and they always laugh at us and say the public won't read this.
[01:14:41.272 --> 01:14:52.838]  I mean, Carol Quigley was led into the elites' own documents in the 60s, wrote Tragedy and Hope, admitting, we control the left, we control the right, we put in the communist and the fascist, we want a global dictatorship run by the banks.
[01:14:53.238 --> 01:14:59.482]  David Rockefeller wrote a book four years ago saying, I want a one-world government that is unelected.
[01:14:59.482 --> 01:15:07.167]  They had a Financial Times of London article, they've had scores of them, but last year saying, and now for global government.
[01:15:07.167 --> 01:15:13.191]  And he said, yes, we've kept it secret for your own good, and that publication is on with the Bilderberg Group, a Bilderberg Group member.
[01:15:13.971 --> 01:15:15.912]  He said, it's secret.
[01:15:15.912 --> 01:15:19.254]  We are going to basically take over the society.
[01:15:19.254 --> 01:15:20.935]  It's authoritarian for your own good.
[01:15:20.935 --> 01:15:23.216]  We're going to have carbon taxes on you.
[01:15:23.216 --> 01:15:25.377]  We're going to control every facet of your life.
[01:15:25.377 --> 01:15:31.220]  And they've now had thousands of articles the last year in every major publication going, okay, world government's real.
[01:15:31.220 --> 01:15:33.202]  Okay, planetary regime is real.
[01:15:33.202 --> 01:15:33.422]  Right.
[01:15:33.422 --> 01:15:36.303]  They're coming forward with this quite openly, it seems.
[01:15:36.303 --> 01:15:38.905]  See, they stalled us until they think it's too late.
[01:15:38.905 --> 01:15:39.145]  Right.
[01:15:39.685 --> 01:15:40.566]  And that's the thing, right?
[01:15:40.566 --> 01:15:49.552]  That we've sort of numbed our brain, we've gone into a robotic way of thinking, and that now they can just sort of bring this stuff forward and nobody will rise up against it?
[01:15:49.552 --> 01:15:50.432]  Is that the idea?
[01:15:50.432 --> 01:15:50.812]  That's it.
[01:15:50.812 --> 01:15:52.514]  The public is on Soma.
[01:15:52.514 --> 01:16:02.320]  They're drinking the sodium fluoride and all the other chemicals in the water that all the mainline studies admit causes cancer, brain damage, 20 point on average IQ reduction in children.
[01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:03.181]  It is a...
[01:16:05.262 --> 01:16:14.590]  Chemical compound that's just one that they put in that just builds up and builds up our whole food supply I mean, that's the GMO they admit killing the rats that eat it.
[01:16:14.590 --> 01:16:19.714]  Yeah Baby weights are going down retardation is going up autism is going up.
[01:16:19.714 --> 01:16:21.396]  It's shot infertility is exploding
[01:16:21.496 --> 01:16:34.469]  Yeah, that for 10,000 years we've eaten the same thing until the last 30 years, our entire food supply has changed completely nutritionally, chemically, to the point where our bodies don't, that's why there's an obesity epidemic, I suppose.
[01:16:34.469 --> 01:16:42.337]  And you can hold up, exactly, you can hold up a thousand government studies, university studies, peer-reviewed,
[01:16:42.777 --> 01:16:43.377]  We're good to go.
[01:17:04.528 --> 01:17:16.760]  In fact, I have this book, Ecoscience, written by the current White House science czar, and in there he says, we've got to engineer the water supply, the food supply, to slowly and incrementally sterilize people.
[01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:24.808]  So, it's an incremental infertility, 80 plus percent sperm reduction in men, baby weights going down.
[01:17:27.150 --> 01:17:35.432]  Chemically, in the water supply and in the food, attacking us, and in government textbook... I mean, they're now proposing on the news putting lithium in the water, Dean.
[01:17:35.432 --> 01:17:36.853]  I did not hear that.
[01:17:36.853 --> 01:17:44.435]  What would be the purpose of putting lithium... I mean, on their... Well, they say if it stops one suicide... You're not for suicide, are you, Dean?
[01:17:44.435 --> 01:17:47.015]  If putting lithium in the water... I'm not for suicide.
[01:17:47.015 --> 01:17:50.716]  If putting lithium in the water stops one suicide, it's worth it.
[01:17:50.716 --> 01:17:51.697]  Are you kidding?
[01:17:51.697 --> 01:17:52.777]  No, that's what they're now proposing.
[01:17:54.107 --> 01:17:56.989]  Well, so, this is what I wonder now.
[01:17:56.989 --> 01:18:00.891]  Personally, you've done this fight now for 14 years.
[01:18:00.891 --> 01:18:06.534]  The emotional toll of this sort of thing, what has that done for you?
[01:18:06.534 --> 01:18:10.756]  How do you get up in the morning and fight this fight so passionately and carry on?
[01:18:10.756 --> 01:18:15.639]  Because I know a lot of people that will, you know, get into conspiracies, they'll give themselves a stroke.
[01:18:15.639 --> 01:18:19.001]  Our own producer is in the hospital every other day because of this.
[01:18:19.001 --> 01:18:22.363]  You know, it's so stressful on a lot of people.
[01:18:22.403 --> 01:18:23.724]  Because you know the truth.
[01:18:23.724 --> 01:18:24.944]  You've seen the documents.
[01:18:24.944 --> 01:18:27.465]  You read the elites saying they're going to do it.
[01:18:27.465 --> 01:18:30.207]  I mean, I had Rothkopf, head of the Kissinger Group, on a few years ago.
[01:18:30.207 --> 01:18:31.708]  He wrote a book called Superstate.
[01:18:31.708 --> 01:18:32.868]  You ought to go interview him.
[01:18:32.868 --> 01:18:34.169]  And he says, yeah, world government's here.
[01:18:34.169 --> 01:18:34.909]  It's for your own good.
[01:18:34.909 --> 01:18:36.610]  We're going to carbon tax you and take over your life.
[01:18:36.610 --> 01:18:38.391]  And a few thousand leaders run everything.
[01:18:39.171 --> 01:18:44.113]  And then I have newspaper reporters in here and they go, Alex, it doesn't exist!
[01:18:44.113 --> 01:18:50.956]  I had a Texas Monthly writer in here off and on three or four times, and he would just say, no, they're not putting hundreds of chemicals in the water.
[01:18:50.956 --> 01:18:54.137]  And I would give him all the documents, he'd say, wow, it's true, but still I don't agree with you.
[01:18:54.857 --> 01:19:12.660]  And, hey, here's all these studies admitting that just this one type of GMO corn from Monsanto that has pesticide that grows naturally in it, so if bugs eat it, they die, is causing liver failure in all the mammals they tested on, massive death, and it's still, well, I don't want to talk about it.
[01:19:12.660 --> 01:19:15.541]  I mean, because they can't understand it.
[01:19:15.541 --> 01:19:17.721]  They can't believe someone's doing it on purpose.
[01:19:17.721 --> 01:19:19.381]  Well, let's say they're not doing it on purpose.
[01:19:19.381 --> 01:19:21.982]  Monsanto knew in the mid-80s when they got approval for this.
[01:19:22.864 --> 01:19:24.144]  And they've got a whole bunch of varieties.
[01:19:24.144 --> 01:19:25.845]  Everyone does similar things.
[01:19:25.845 --> 01:19:27.105]  Some worse than others.
[01:19:27.105 --> 01:19:29.026]  They know it's out.
[01:19:29.026 --> 01:19:30.386]  They keep doing it.
[01:19:30.386 --> 01:19:42.149]  Bayer Pharmaceutical for over a decade, knowingly, allowed for HIV to be at all their factor eight and hepatitis killing over a million people all over the world.
[01:19:42.149 --> 01:19:44.490]  And then I said to the reporter, I said, see, they're killing us.
[01:19:44.490 --> 01:19:45.350]  They know.
[01:19:45.350 --> 01:19:47.291]  And he says, but they didn't mean to.
[01:19:47.291 --> 01:19:49.131]  What the hell are you talking about?
[01:19:49.131 --> 01:19:50.092]  OK, fine.
[01:19:50.092 --> 01:19:51.312]  None of them went to prison.
[01:19:51.872 --> 01:19:53.473]  Why is that okay?
[01:19:53.473 --> 01:19:58.717]  I've got all these textbooks where they're doing is to us, but that's what I'm angry about, Dean Haglund.
[01:19:58.717 --> 01:20:00.218]  And we've got to get angry like humans.
[01:20:00.218 --> 01:20:01.019]  Stay there.
[01:20:01.019 --> 01:20:05.622]  We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[01:21:00.268 --> 01:21:10.294]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency, to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[01:21:10.294 --> 01:21:16.737]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system, wisdom being lost with time.
[01:21:16.737 --> 01:21:25.582]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[01:21:25.962 --> 01:21:35.149]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[01:21:35.149 --> 01:21:39.752]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.
[01:21:39.752 --> 01:21:41.553]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:21:41.553 --> 01:21:44.055]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.
[01:21:44.335 --> 01:21:45.376]  Call me today at 800-686-2237.
[01:21:45.376 --> 01:21:51.838]  I will give you a silver dollar free just for purchasing the book.
[01:21:51.838 --> 01:21:52.539]  Call today at 800-686-2237.
[01:21:52.539 --> 01:21:52.899]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[01:21:52.899 --> 01:21:55.700]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:21:55.700 --> 01:21:57.361]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:21:57.361 --> 01:21:59.022]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:22:10.811 --> 01:22:13.474]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:22:13.474 --> 01:22:19.880]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:22:19.880 --> 01:22:25.065]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:22:25.065 --> 01:22:35.054]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:22:35.174 --> 01:22:37.516]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:22:37.516 --> 01:22:39.117]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:22:39.117 --> 01:22:41.579]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:22:41.579 --> 01:22:43.700]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:22:43.700 --> 01:22:48.844]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:22:48.844 --> 01:22:57.970]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:23:00.071 --> 01:23:03.333]  Have your house payments skyrocketed under an adjustable rate mortgage?
[01:23:03.333 --> 01:23:05.314]  Have you been laid off?
[01:23:05.314 --> 01:23:07.074]  Or had your hours cut?
[01:23:07.074 --> 01:23:09.315]  Are balloon payments coming due?
[01:23:09.315 --> 01:23:13.137]  You need help from MortgageFraudExaminers.com.
[01:23:13.137 --> 01:23:19.580]  To stop the housing crisis, Congress and the White House are pinning their hopes on homeowners renegotiating their mortgages.
[01:23:19.580 --> 01:23:23.742]  The trouble is, the banks are saying no 80% of the time.
[01:23:23.742 --> 01:23:26.844]  MortgageFraudExaminers.com can help you get the leverage you need
[01:23:31.630 --> 01:23:32.751]  Absolutely deficient.
[01:23:32.751 --> 01:23:39.336]  MortgageFraudExaminers.com can perform forensic loan audits and appraisals to find legal deficits in your mortgage.
[01:23:39.336 --> 01:23:42.158]  It's like CSI for your home loan.
[01:23:42.158 --> 01:23:47.762]  Banks and lenders suddenly start cooperating when faced with a lawsuit for violating lending laws or appraisal fraud.
[01:23:47.762 --> 01:23:50.664]  Find out how MortgageFraudExaminers.com can help you.

[01:24:04.314 --> 01:24:16.222]  Dean Haglund's our guest, but he's really here to interview me, so we're multitasking right now.
[01:24:16.222 --> 01:24:17.563]  Multitasking.
[01:24:17.563 --> 01:24:18.964]  Dean, go ahead and ask your question.
[01:24:18.964 --> 01:24:25.148]  Well, I'm wondering about the personal toll, this quest, this mission that you've been on.
[01:24:25.148 --> 01:24:28.631]  You said it yourself, this mission to bring out the truth to everyone.
[01:24:29.091 --> 01:24:33.452]  I know other people who get into conspiracies often find it very stressful.
[01:24:33.452 --> 01:24:50.137]  It is very stressful, but when people attack me, and people lie about me, and people make stuff up, and run their COINTELPRO operations, it only makes me more focused, and more angry, and more determined, and actually gives me energy.
[01:24:50.137 --> 01:24:53.678]  So that's why I've seen the toll it takes on most people.
[01:24:54.638 --> 01:24:56.099]  Uh, and it has taken a toll on me.
[01:24:56.099 --> 01:24:58.139]  I look a lot older than I actually am.
[01:24:58.139 --> 01:25:00.120]  I'm thinking you're looking younger than when I first saw you.
[01:25:00.120 --> 01:25:03.301]  Well, I have lost about 35 pounds, and I'm going to try to go down about another 30.
[01:25:03.301 --> 01:25:04.222]  You're working out.
[01:25:04.222 --> 01:25:05.982]  Yeah, I am jogging and lifting weights.
[01:25:05.982 --> 01:25:06.363]  Good for you!
[01:25:08.325 --> 01:25:17.672]  I mean, I have decided and committed myself, no matter if they put me in prison, no matter if they kill me, no matter if they destroy my name in the media and lie about me, I know I'm good.
[01:25:17.672 --> 01:25:19.133]  I know I told the truth.
[01:25:19.133 --> 01:25:20.775]  I know I did my research.
[01:25:20.775 --> 01:25:25.498]  I know that I have accurately forecast so much of what's happened.
[01:25:25.498 --> 01:25:26.919]  Two months before 9-11.
[01:25:26.919 --> 01:25:28.661]  You're welcome for your film to use that clip.
[01:25:28.661 --> 01:25:34.926]  I mean, locally on AXS TV and the radio, saying they're going to stage an attack, blame it on Bin Laden and the World Trade Center, to bring in these new wars.
[01:25:35.626 --> 01:25:37.607]  We're good to go.
[01:25:55.757 --> 01:25:55.837]  Yeah.
[01:26:10.794 --> 01:26:16.517]  As a federalization drill, bare minimum, to scare everyone into forced inoculation and submission.
[01:26:16.517 --> 01:26:25.181]  And then it all happened, and then we got secret documents from the state of Texas, our sources, that they were really going to a level six to declare a global pandemic, when it wasn't even going to be a pandemic.
[01:26:25.181 --> 01:26:29.303]  We posted those secret documents, got ridiculed, two months later it came out that was the case.
[01:26:29.303 --> 01:26:30.804]  We've been under level six the whole time.
[01:26:30.804 --> 01:26:31.644]  Yeah.
[01:26:31.644 --> 01:26:32.425]  I was then able...
[01:26:33.725 --> 01:26:45.697]  To point out that the whole thing was a hoax, now it's being investigated by the EU and they're saying it is a hoax, where the big pharma bought off all the major government advisors to say this was real and deadly.
[01:26:45.697 --> 01:26:56.808]  And so what happens time and time again is, on so many subjects, I mean I told people in January of 2009, I said Obama will have the lowest approval rating of any president by the end of the year.
[01:26:57.068 --> 01:27:02.050]  He will go back on everything he promised to do because I knew who his advisors were and what they had been saying.
[01:27:02.050 --> 01:27:09.512]  They were sending out quiet press releases to heads of government and others saying, don't worry, he's not getting rid of NAFTA and GATT.
[01:27:09.512 --> 01:27:11.893]  Don't worry, he's not getting us out of the WTO.
[01:27:11.893 --> 01:27:15.174]  Don't worry, he's not going to end the wars, he's going to expand them.
[01:27:15.174 --> 01:27:18.555]  Don't worry, he's going to keep the torture and secret arrests and rendition going.
[01:27:18.555 --> 01:27:22.797]  I mean, they were putting out in the lobbyist reports, don't worry, it's a scam.
[01:27:23.517 --> 01:27:36.568]  Just like the insurance company six months ago put out releases to other lobbyist groups saying, don't oppose this, we're just saying we're against the healthcare thing so people won't know it's a big money maker for us.
[01:27:36.568 --> 01:27:36.908]  Right.
[01:27:36.908 --> 01:27:41.372]  But then the Democrats actually found out, Howard Dean and others, and said, whoa, don't vote for this.
[01:27:41.372 --> 01:27:44.214]  See, so we go off their own documents.
[01:27:44.434 --> 01:27:44.914]  Yeah.
[01:27:44.914 --> 01:27:52.000]  Because the New World Order is so big that most of what they do isn't really secret, it's just not in the newspaper until after they've done it.
[01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:53.542]  Well, and this is my question then.
[01:27:53.542 --> 01:27:54.683]  How do you know?
[01:27:54.683 --> 01:27:58.226]  I mean, where... there's all these alternative sources of information.
[01:27:58.226 --> 01:28:08.975]  We live in an information blizzard right now, so any comfort zone that anybody wants to sit in mentally, they can go to any website that will, you know, feed that information they want.
[01:28:09.275 --> 01:28:09.836]  Absolutely.
[01:28:09.836 --> 01:28:10.076]  Right.
[01:28:28.358 --> 01:28:42.433]  Powerful guilds of psychopaths and criminal networks of every race, religion and group at the top meet and sometimes they fight with each other but they meet and discuss the rules like in the Godfather, a Mafia Commission meeting.
[01:28:43.775 --> 01:28:49.620]  That's what they do, and it's different groups together agreeing on the next year's agenda.
[01:28:49.620 --> 01:28:53.424]  And I don't go off the thousands of conspiracy sites.
[01:28:53.424 --> 01:28:55.245]  I don't go off of rumors.
[01:28:55.245 --> 01:28:57.888]  I get a call that they've shut down the Austin Gun Show.
[01:28:57.888 --> 01:28:59.930]  I start making calls to the gun show owner.
[01:28:59.930 --> 01:29:01.711]  I start making calls to the police.
[01:29:01.711 --> 01:29:03.153]  I get the document.
[01:29:03.153 --> 01:29:04.394]  I find out it really happened.
[01:29:04.754 --> 01:29:07.657]  We break the big story, it becomes a national news issue.
[01:29:07.657 --> 01:29:21.831]  Police send me secret MIAC and Homeland Security documents where they're saying Homeland Security is really for peace activists, gun owners, conservatives, libertarians, returning veterans, that the whole architecture is built for the American people.
[01:29:21.831 --> 01:29:25.795]  We then put it out, the COINTELPRO, the government ops, all say it's fake.
[01:29:25.795 --> 01:29:27.897]  Then the media is forced to admit it's real.
[01:29:27.897 --> 01:29:28.637]  So every time
[01:29:29.398 --> 01:29:34.842]  Just like when I exposed 9-11 or any other big issue, I know I'm going to be attacked, but then the truth is going to come out.
[01:29:34.842 --> 01:29:40.226]  I mean, they had a stage Psy-Op earlier this week, but I know the truth will come out on that.
[01:29:40.226 --> 01:29:46.911]  And so I understand the truth is invincible, and as long as I go forward and don't care what people say or do, we're going to win.
[01:29:46.911 --> 01:29:51.175]  We're going to come right back, Dean, with more of your questions straight ahead.
[01:29:51.175 --> 01:29:52.576]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.576 --> 01:29:55.118]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.118 --> 01:29:57.800]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.285 --> 01:30:04.828]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:30:04.828 --> 01:30:05.749]  Number one.
[01:30:05.749 --> 01:30:09.171]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:30:09.171 --> 01:30:10.031]  Number two.
[01:30:10.031 --> 01:30:14.934]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:30:14.934 --> 01:30:15.675]  It's true.
[01:30:15.675 --> 01:30:20.218]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:30:20.538 --> 01:30:21.359]  Number 3.
[01:30:21.359 --> 01:30:24.941]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:30:24.941 --> 01:30:28.864]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:30:28.864 --> 01:30:29.664]  Number 4.
[01:30:29.664 --> 01:30:32.426]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:30:32.426 --> 01:30:36.108]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:30:36.108 --> 01:30:36.889]  Number 5.
[01:30:36.889 --> 01:30:41.032]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:30:41.032 --> 01:30:45.795]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:30:46.075 --> 01:30:50.259]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:30:50.259 --> 01:30:52.041]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:30:52.041 --> 01:30:54.283]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:30:54.283 --> 01:30:56.646]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:31:01.994 --> 01:31:05.955]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:31:05.955 --> 01:31:14.816]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:31:14.816 --> 01:31:19.437]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:31:19.437 --> 01:31:30.259]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:31:30.899 --> 01:31:40.401]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:31:40.401 --> 01:31:45.823]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:31:45.823 --> 01:31:53.324]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:31:53.324 --> 01:31:56.065]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:32:01.215 --> 01:32:05.218]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:32:05.218 --> 01:32:08.480]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:32:08.480 --> 01:32:13.283]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:32:13.283 --> 01:32:19.667]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:32:19.667 --> 01:32:21.909]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:32:22.449 --> 01:32:23.931]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:32:23.931 --> 01:32:25.212]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:32:25.212 --> 01:32:27.455]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:32:41.351 --> 01:32:48.616]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:32:48.616 --> 01:32:57.741]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:33:14.198 --> 01:33:22.000]  Dean Hagelin is our guest, and I had intended to interview you when you called me a few days ago, but you're saying you want to interview me, so that's fine.
[01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:30.343]  Something different for the listeners, but I'm going to try to back Bob Chapman up 15 minutes into the next hour so that, and I didn't know you just came to Austin to interview me.
[01:33:30.343 --> 01:33:31.583]  I'm honored.
[01:33:31.583 --> 01:33:33.144]  That way we can...
[01:33:34.304 --> 01:33:36.405]  We can actually have some time to talk to you as well.
[01:33:36.405 --> 01:33:36.846]  Oh, okay.
[01:33:36.846 --> 01:33:38.047]  But I mean, I am ranting, Dean.
[01:33:38.047 --> 01:33:38.627]  Please continue.
[01:33:38.627 --> 01:33:39.988]  I love the ranting.
[01:33:39.988 --> 01:33:40.848]  And this is the thing.
[01:33:40.848 --> 01:33:44.171]  You know, you are, of course, connected to all this information.
[01:33:44.171 --> 01:33:51.856]  But my question is then, how does a person like me, the average Joe, navigate their way through all of this and find this truth?
[01:33:51.856 --> 01:34:03.644]  I mean, other than coming to your website, is there advice you have for someone that is trying to assimilate all these disparaging and seemingly contradictory
[01:34:07.226 --> 01:34:17.634]  Well, what the global engineers do, and we already knew this from COINTELPRO documents, like the one I have right here.
[01:34:17.634 --> 01:34:21.977]  That was a government program to get alternative media groups, activists to fight with each other.
[01:34:23.905 --> 01:34:30.592]  We know that there are those type of programs, but we have Cass Sunstein, the White House regulations czar, coming out in white papers
[01:34:38.692 --> 01:34:54.199]  Just saying, we want to infiltrate people's groups, come up with wild conspiracy theories that are totally ridiculous, as we've done in the past, is what he says, and he says we want to get everybody in fighting with each other, and we want to start moving towards making an illegal
[01:34:54.699 --> 01:34:57.100]  to criticize man-made global warming.
[01:34:57.100 --> 01:35:01.223]  He said we'll even make it illegal to say that a little bit of sunshine is good for you.
[01:35:01.223 --> 01:35:06.766]  We will set the parameter very wide where nothing is acceptable for discussion but what we say.
[01:35:06.766 --> 01:35:11.229]  So it's more than just a label to discredit what people are saying to call him a conspiracy theorist.
[01:35:11.889 --> 01:35:20.240]  Really, it's about saying, we're going to arrest Galileo if he says that the sun is the center of our solar system, not the earth.
[01:35:20.240 --> 01:35:25.447]  If you say that the earth is orbiting the sun, you're a conspiracy theorist, basically.
[01:35:25.447 --> 01:35:27.469]  It is a type of heresy.
[01:35:28.070 --> 01:35:35.616]  And so what they're saying is, we give you a very narrow, and it's always getting more and more narrow in this Orwellian system, set of things that are acceptable.
[01:35:35.616 --> 01:35:37.498]  You don't talk about politics or religion.
[01:35:37.498 --> 01:35:38.679]  You don't get politically involved.
[01:35:38.679 --> 01:35:39.760]  You don't talk to your neighbors.
[01:35:39.760 --> 01:35:40.661]  That's bad!
[01:35:40.661 --> 01:35:42.242]  You don't talk about the foreign banks.
[01:35:42.242 --> 01:35:44.744]  You don't talk about the banker bailout.
[01:35:44.744 --> 01:35:46.726]  You don't criticize the government.
[01:35:46.726 --> 01:35:48.167]  All of that is unacceptable.
[01:35:48.167 --> 01:35:54.612]  So they attack, they infiltrate, and then they have radio and TV shows and other things that will mix
[01:35:55.751 --> 01:36:08.158]  Just like the X-Files, and I'm not criticizing it, but we know they did it, and I'd like to ask you about this, you know, that would mix a Chupacabra one episode with deadly GMO crops that sterilize you the next, and that's actually what they're doing.
[01:36:08.158 --> 01:36:22.347]  Just like you said, the CIA would come to Chris Carter and others and say, we'd like to see this in your episodes, and he'd say, okay, gee, that's an interesting idea, and notice most of the episodes that they would push for would be real serious things that they or others were planning to do,
[01:36:22.987 --> 01:36:30.829]  So when it actually happened, people were psychologically inoculated in a revelation of the method subconsciously to say, oh, that's just entertainment.
[01:36:30.829 --> 01:36:34.070]  Right, and oh, you watch too much X-Files if that's what you're believing, right?
[01:36:34.070 --> 01:36:34.610]  Exactly.
[01:36:34.610 --> 01:36:41.212]  So one episode, a flying saucer lands with a worm that gets inside people and makes them mind-control slaves.
[01:36:41.212 --> 01:36:42.013]  Ridiculous.
[01:36:42.013 --> 01:36:43.193]  Right.
[01:36:43.193 --> 01:36:45.114]  Not seeing in the universe that couldn't exist.
[01:36:45.114 --> 01:36:49.495]  And the next episode, there's a private group of bankers that are running everything.
[01:36:49.955 --> 01:36:51.155]  Well no, that's a fact.
[01:36:51.155 --> 01:37:11.099]  So see, and that's how media, the only time mainstream media allows this to be programmed into mainstream TV or mainstream radio is to, this hour we're going to be talking to Katherine Austin Fitz about how when she was at HUD, the government was running giant fraudulent scams.
[01:37:11.099 --> 01:37:12.980]  Totally real, totally documented.
[01:37:12.980 --> 01:37:13.760]  And then next hour,
[01:37:14.560 --> 01:37:17.161]  We're going to talk to demon-possessed werewolf people.
[01:37:17.161 --> 01:37:20.543]  Okay, so see, then it gets discredited because demon-possessed werewolf people.
[01:37:20.543 --> 01:37:22.644]  And I'm not attacking folks that do that.
[01:37:22.644 --> 01:37:25.106]  It's entertaining, it's interesting, it's fine.
[01:37:25.106 --> 01:37:28.728]  And a lot of those folks have made the point, well this is entertainment on the show, this is serious.
[01:37:28.728 --> 01:37:29.928]  I don't do any of that.
[01:37:29.928 --> 01:37:30.329]  Right.
[01:37:30.329 --> 01:37:35.952]  I don't, because listeners will find me talking about star children from Alpha Centauri are interesting.
[01:37:35.952 --> 01:37:37.252]  This is not a variety show.
[01:37:37.252 --> 01:37:38.293]  We don't do that.
[01:37:38.293 --> 01:37:38.653]  Right.
[01:37:38.653 --> 01:37:43.476]  I sit here and I go off the real facts and I take a mainstream news article
[01:37:44.639 --> 01:37:49.120]  Like a story I have over here, where it says, Bin Laden blasts U.S.
[01:37:49.120 --> 01:37:50.541]  for climate change.
[01:37:50.541 --> 01:38:02.884]  And then at the end of the AP article, this is worse journalism than a high school journalism department, it says, the new message authenticity could not be immediately confirmed, and neither could last weeks.
[01:38:02.884 --> 01:38:10.166]  So now, any audio tape they put out is Bin Laden, and they've had the linguist listen, they've done the voice key identification, it isn't even anybody near him.
[01:38:10.686 --> 01:38:14.368]  It's just fake videos edited from old videos, they've been caught.
[01:38:14.368 --> 01:38:29.196]  The Intel Center, admittedly run by two of Rumsfeld's former top guys who were in PSYOPs at the CIA previously, they always upload the Adam Gadon, grandson of the former ADL head.
[01:38:29.196 --> 01:38:35.860]  He comes out as the American Al-Qaeda and they put the Intel Center logo in the same video layer as the Al-Qaeda logo.
[01:38:36.560 --> 01:38:39.841]  So it wasn't another version of a video they got and laid theirs in.
[01:38:39.841 --> 01:38:51.263]  Anybody who understands digital pixels, people have degrees in this, we'd already done it before it came out in Wired Magazine and other places, we pull it up and blow it up on screen because it should be different pixel layers, it's the same pixel layer.
[01:38:51.263 --> 01:38:51.603]  Wow.
[01:38:51.603 --> 01:38:52.223]  You understand?
[01:38:52.223 --> 01:38:56.724]  Yeah, so they're putting the watermark in it, so they basically created it.
[01:38:56.724 --> 01:38:57.604]  They created it.
[01:38:57.604 --> 01:38:59.605]  Because that watermark's already placed inside.
[01:38:59.605 --> 01:38:59.825]  And it's 100%.
[01:38:59.825 --> 01:38:59.885]  Wow.
[01:39:01.721 --> 01:39:02.221]  Wow.
[01:39:02.221 --> 01:39:08.587]  I mean, if you see online videos where it's somebody's news video and then somebody slaps up, say, their website on it.
[01:39:08.587 --> 01:39:11.249]  You notice it's crisp, but there's pixelation around the edges.
[01:39:11.249 --> 01:39:11.589]  Yeah.
[01:39:11.589 --> 01:39:13.070]  That's just with one generation.
[01:39:13.070 --> 01:39:15.112]  This is scientific.
[01:39:15.112 --> 01:39:15.933]  Scientific.
[01:39:15.933 --> 01:39:20.577]  You can tell the compression rate, what it was done on, what type of compression, what type of machine.
[01:39:20.577 --> 01:39:22.338]  They have computer programs a decade ago.
[01:39:22.338 --> 01:39:29.184]  You can run them through with fingerprints and tell, okay, there were three generations before the Intel Center put their logo on.
[01:39:29.184 --> 01:39:29.324]  No.
[01:39:29.924 --> 01:39:35.567]  Same, first generation, crisp and clear, Al Qaeda videos coming out from the U.S.
[01:39:35.567 --> 01:39:36.168]  government.
[01:39:36.168 --> 01:39:38.789]  And that's just for disinformation to confuse people?
[01:39:38.789 --> 01:39:40.110]  Well, it's to scare people!
[01:39:40.110 --> 01:39:43.072]  Oh my gosh, there's a new audio tape found on a website!
[01:39:43.072 --> 01:39:44.112]  It's bin Laden!
[01:39:44.112 --> 01:39:46.714]  He says he carried out the underwear bombing!
[01:39:46.714 --> 01:39:51.416]  Oh my gosh, he says we better pass global warming rules or he's gonna attack us again!
[01:39:51.416 --> 01:39:52.097]  Right.
[01:39:52.097 --> 01:39:57.600]  Oh my gosh, he says we better, you know, give in to big government or he'll climb out from underneath the bed and eat us!
[01:39:58.902 --> 01:40:01.403]  But now, okay, so let me ask this question, then.
[01:40:01.403 --> 01:40:06.984]  If media and that media control, yet you're affiliated now with ABC, is that right?
[01:40:06.984 --> 01:40:07.904]  Or ABC Radio?
[01:40:07.904 --> 01:40:09.165]  No, absolutely not true.
[01:40:09.165 --> 01:40:11.265]  See, that's how internet disinformation works.
[01:40:11.265 --> 01:40:12.245]  Thank you.
[01:40:12.245 --> 01:40:15.026]  And that's definitely COINTELPRO in that case.
[01:40:15.026 --> 01:40:15.986]  Do you have a cell phone, Dean?
[01:40:15.986 --> 01:40:17.067]  I do.
[01:40:17.067 --> 01:40:17.787]  May I have it, please?
[01:40:17.787 --> 01:40:19.147]  No, but I mean, may I have it?
[01:40:19.147 --> 01:40:19.967]  Right there.
[01:40:19.967 --> 01:40:21.788]  Okay, this is an iPhone, like I have?
[01:40:21.788 --> 01:40:22.028]  Yeah.
[01:40:22.028 --> 01:40:23.188]  Okay, I have an iPhone.
[01:40:23.188 --> 01:40:24.229]  Now, I have an iPhone, too.
[01:40:24.229 --> 01:40:24.809]  In fact, it's out there.
[01:40:24.809 --> 01:40:25.409]  Will you bring it to me?
[01:40:26.460 --> 01:40:28.384]  I don't own any stock in Apple.
[01:40:28.384 --> 01:40:30.048]  Apple Corporation doesn't tell me what to do.
[01:40:30.048 --> 01:40:31.972]  I have nothing to do with Steve Jobs.
[01:40:31.972 --> 01:40:34.237]  I have absolutely nothing to do with any of this.
[01:40:34.237 --> 01:40:35.360]  But I have an Apple phone.
[01:40:36.488 --> 01:40:39.651]  Okay, and I have a Toshiba television.
[01:40:39.651 --> 01:40:40.272]  Right.
[01:40:40.272 --> 01:40:40.853]  Okay.
[01:40:40.853 --> 01:40:41.613]  LG over there.
[01:40:41.613 --> 01:40:51.043]  Yes, now if you wanted to do a radio show by yourself and syndicate it yourself, you'd have to go to Jones Broadcasting, you'd have to go to Clear Channel, or you'd have to go to ABC Satellite.
[01:40:51.043 --> 01:40:56.609]  There's three providers and any radio station owner listening, this is laughing because they understand this is a fact and how ridiculous it is.
[01:40:56.809 --> 01:40:57.189]  Right.
[01:40:57.189 --> 01:41:01.031]  Now, Jones just won't sell a feed to anybody.
[01:41:01.031 --> 01:41:04.392]  Clear Channel didn't tell us this until we actually leased one.
[01:41:04.392 --> 01:41:06.933]  Ted Anderson did, the owner of the little network I'm on.
[01:41:06.933 --> 01:41:11.755]  He went and actually leased one for a year and found out, oh, we didn't tell you.
[01:41:11.755 --> 01:41:15.656]  We won't give you the decoding scramble code for stations that want to pull it.
[01:41:15.656 --> 01:41:17.457]  You know, they have thousands of feeds to sell.
[01:41:17.457 --> 01:41:18.917]  So that was... Ted was out 12 times $5,000.
[01:41:18.917 --> 01:41:19.297]  It was $5,000 a month.
[01:41:19.297 --> 01:41:19.798]  So Ted went
[01:41:23.579 --> 01:41:30.261]  And he was trying to be on little TV satellites, but you'd have to ship those to stations because stations never had them hooked up because they get radio.
[01:41:30.261 --> 01:41:38.324]  And then we buy a sub frequency on some Christian network or a Mexican TV station.
[01:41:38.324 --> 01:41:42.945]  And then people say we work for the Mexicans because they play on the public's ignorance.
[01:41:42.945 --> 01:41:43.365]  Right.
[01:41:43.365 --> 01:41:43.905]  OK.
[01:41:43.905 --> 01:41:45.086]  And so the only company
[01:41:45.746 --> 01:41:50.447]  Uh, that, uh, because the satellite's on the verge of, uh, I think they already switched to another one.
[01:41:50.447 --> 01:41:51.088]  Yeah.
[01:41:51.088 --> 01:41:52.268]  Was ABC.
[01:41:52.268 --> 01:41:53.508]  So we go with our little $5,000.
[01:41:53.508 --> 01:41:54.049]  Right.
[01:41:54.049 --> 01:42:05.812]  And we take weeks getting them on the phone, we have to hook up the equipment, and then of thousands of feeds, gardening shows, race car shows, when you're listening to a baseball game from another state, it's going over one of those three satellites.
[01:42:05.812 --> 01:42:09.393]  It's like if I call somebody in New York City, it's probably going over a satellite.
[01:42:09.393 --> 01:42:09.753]  Yeah.
[01:42:09.753 --> 01:42:14.555]  And see, if I go doot-doot-doot-doot and call on an Apple phone on AT&T, I'm not owned by AT&T.
[01:42:15.635 --> 01:42:21.720]  So see, or let's say there's hundreds of corporations with Genesis in the name, which there are.
[01:42:21.720 --> 01:42:30.107]  There's Genesis Porno Magazine, and there's Genesis Lightbulbs, and there's Genesis... Ted Anderson, incorporated in Minnesota.
[01:42:30.107 --> 01:42:31.508]  Anybody can check it.
[01:42:31.508 --> 01:42:33.650]  It's Genesis Broadcasting.
[01:42:33.650 --> 01:42:36.793]  He set it up in 1998, I guess, or 97.
[01:42:36.793 --> 01:42:41.176]  Disinfo comes out and says, there's a Genesis in Saudi Arabia!
[01:42:42.057 --> 01:42:43.559]  And we're owned by that!
[01:42:43.559 --> 01:42:44.821]  Total lie!
[01:42:44.821 --> 01:42:49.327]  Or there's a guy named Alex Jones who's 60-something years old with Scientology.
[01:42:49.327 --> 01:42:50.809]  I'm him now!
[01:42:50.809 --> 01:42:53.954]  Or there's a billionaire named Alex Jones in Canada.
[01:42:53.954 --> 01:42:55.436]  I'm supposedly him now!
[01:42:55.436 --> 01:42:58.019]  There's Alex S. Jones on NPR!
[01:42:59.105 --> 01:43:00.446]  I'm him now!
[01:43:00.446 --> 01:43:09.976]  So see, just like the internet can expose the big banks and the government, it can also be used as a COINTELPRO operation to make up all sorts of lies.
[01:43:09.976 --> 01:43:13.560]  I mean, they photoshopped my head on a Catholic priest outfit.
[01:43:13.560 --> 01:43:15.422]  I'm Protestant, and there I am.
[01:43:16.062 --> 01:43:19.464]  Or they photoshopped my head on a woman and say, there's Alex in drag!
[01:43:19.464 --> 01:43:20.985]  And they say it like it's real!
[01:43:20.985 --> 01:43:27.970]  Or they photoshopped my head on a Jewish man and put me in a Jewish wedding with a fat lady!
[01:43:27.970 --> 01:43:29.011]  It's real!
[01:43:29.011 --> 01:43:29.971]  It's proof!
[01:43:29.971 --> 01:43:34.495]  And in many of these cases, it's not just haters or jealous people doing it.
[01:43:34.495 --> 01:43:36.316]  Some of it is.
[01:43:36.316 --> 01:43:44.501]  I have actually confirmed and documented that, and it's been in newspapers, we're tracked by the army, we have informants following us, we have people trying to set us up,
[01:43:46.002 --> 01:43:48.324]  We have them planting disinfo everywhere.
[01:43:48.324 --> 01:43:53.650]  We had an Israeli diamond dealer run a five-year program saying I'm a Vatican killer.
[01:43:53.650 --> 01:43:55.091]  Oh yes!
[01:43:55.091 --> 01:43:58.674]  And it all tracks back to government.
[01:43:58.674 --> 01:44:04.020]  And so the key is, you're asking me about this today so I'm talking about it, but the key is I ignore it.
[01:44:04.660 --> 01:44:08.723]  I get on air and I say, I know I'm good, I know I'm real.
[01:44:08.723 --> 01:44:11.885]  80% of the people conservatively you talk to, Alex Jones will come up.
[01:44:11.885 --> 01:44:16.988]  Alex Jones will come up, because Alex Jones, 98% of the time, stays on topic.
[01:44:16.988 --> 01:44:19.770]  But 2% is going to talk about this to educate people.
[01:44:19.770 --> 01:44:22.092]  Alex Jones stays focused.
[01:44:22.092 --> 01:44:25.954]  Alex Jones says, here's David Rockefeller's book, where he says he wants world government.
[01:44:25.954 --> 01:44:29.977]  Here's Helmut Schmidt, he published Men in Power's political retrospective saying it.
[01:44:29.977 --> 01:44:33.860]  Here's Carol Quigley writing a book admitting world government's taking over and it's good for you.
[01:44:34.620 --> 01:44:41.382]  Here's the UN saying they want a world government to cut off your resources, bankrupt you, then they're going to have CPS take your children and sterilize you.
[01:44:41.382 --> 01:44:47.064]  Here's 70-something government textbooks saying they want to poison the water to sterilize you.
[01:44:47.064 --> 01:44:52.226]  Here is all these peer-reviewed reports that all these major GMO crops are sterilizing you.
[01:44:52.226 --> 01:44:59.048]  Then I have top genetic engineers involved in the development saying, we told them this was sterilizing people and they said, that's what we want.
[01:44:59.048 --> 01:44:59.948]  There's too many people.
[01:45:00.188 --> 01:45:04.953]  So what we do is, it doesn't matter if I'm sacrificing myself to all the attacks.
[01:45:04.953 --> 01:45:07.656]  Because at another level, the attacks just make me bigger.
[01:45:07.656 --> 01:45:11.841]  I use their celebrity system against them because any publicity is good publicity.
[01:45:11.841 --> 01:45:18.328]  And then so, even the attacks actually, and I never knew this, I just tried to do the right thing, and it turned out that doing right just always works.
[01:45:18.328 --> 01:45:18.969]  It's invincible.
[01:45:19.309 --> 01:45:21.432]  I mean, if they kill me, it's invincible.
[01:45:21.432 --> 01:45:23.174]  If they put me in prison, I only get bigger.
[01:45:23.174 --> 01:45:24.115]  It's invincible.
[01:45:24.115 --> 01:45:28.219]  If they torture me or put a fake video of me saying something, people won't believe that.
[01:45:28.219 --> 01:45:29.120]  It's invincible.
[01:45:29.120 --> 01:45:33.525]  The truth... Lies have to be reapplied, Dean, over and over and over and over again.
[01:45:33.525 --> 01:45:33.986]  Right.
[01:45:33.986 --> 01:45:35.988]  But the truth is powerful.
[01:45:35.988 --> 01:45:36.829]  It's explosive.
[01:45:36.829 --> 01:45:37.750]  You can't suppress it.
[01:45:37.750 --> 01:45:39.853]  If you try, it explodes with even more force.
[01:45:40.633 --> 01:45:47.979]  Truth has just an incredible dynamicness to it, which just cuts through the lies.
[01:45:47.979 --> 01:45:51.301]  And the more lies you pile on it, the more powerful it gets.
[01:45:51.301 --> 01:45:54.664]  And also, those who have discernment know I'm for real.
[01:45:54.664 --> 01:45:56.925]  Those that have discernment have researched my facts.
[01:45:56.925 --> 01:46:03.230]  Those that have discernment have learned about the COINTELPRO tricks, and now they understand, and now they're wise to what's going on.
[01:46:03.490 --> 01:46:03.930]  Right.
[01:46:03.930 --> 01:46:07.072]  And all this information, you put it on your websites and all that?
[01:46:07.072 --> 01:46:07.692]  Absolutely!
[01:46:07.692 --> 01:46:09.993]  Anybody can access all of the stuff that you get?
[01:46:09.993 --> 01:46:10.853]  Yes, yes.
[01:46:10.853 --> 01:46:12.074]  Everything we get.
[01:46:12.074 --> 01:46:12.634]  Everything?
[01:46:12.634 --> 01:46:13.054]  Everything.
[01:46:13.054 --> 01:46:13.374]  Wow.
[01:46:13.374 --> 01:46:24.919]  And so, you never find that then, as you're getting closer to what is a universal single truth, that as the lies pile on, you know you're getting closer to that truth?
[01:46:24.919 --> 01:46:25.260]  Yes.
[01:46:25.260 --> 01:46:26.540]  Oh, it's getting worse every day.
[01:46:26.540 --> 01:46:27.220]  Is it really?
[01:46:27.220 --> 01:46:27.801]  Absolutely.
[01:46:27.801 --> 01:46:29.401]  Is it coming to a head?
[01:46:29.401 --> 01:46:30.422]  Predict the future.
[01:46:30.422 --> 01:46:31.842]  How do you see this all?
[01:46:31.842 --> 01:46:32.903]  I just hope it gets worse.
[01:46:33.323 --> 01:46:34.764]  Is that right?
[01:46:34.764 --> 01:46:36.845]  Why is that?
[01:46:36.845 --> 01:46:40.407]  Because all the hit pieces only bring people to me.
[01:46:40.407 --> 01:46:48.491]  And then they're going to hear me say they're taking your baby's blood at 37 years at birth and putting it in a UN biological weapons laboratory.
[01:46:48.491 --> 01:46:54.634]  And I had the documents, I had the congressman, I had members of the Parliament of Australia on exposing it 12 years ago.
[01:46:55.615 --> 01:47:06.721]  And they hear me talk about it, people won't go check the document out, they won't even go to Infowars.com, and now they hear it on their news everywhere, going, yeah, we're taking your blood, it's been going on for 37 years, globally, for your own good.
[01:47:06.721 --> 01:47:09.382]  And people go, whoa!
[01:47:09.382 --> 01:47:15.165]  See, more often than not, I go, oh, here's 10 articles today calling for rural government saying how good it is.
[01:47:15.165 --> 01:47:18.386]  Oh, here's a bill calling for FEMA camps for your safety.
[01:47:18.386 --> 01:47:20.768]  I told you they would call for it for your safety.
[01:47:20.768 --> 01:47:21.448]  Yeah.
[01:47:21.448 --> 01:47:23.509]  See, they wouldn't come out and say, oh, it's an evil FEMA camp.
[01:47:23.649 --> 01:47:23.929]  Right.
[01:47:23.929 --> 01:47:33.097]  So see, I know their whole... I mean, I was able to say exactly what Glenn Beck would do with his debunking of FEMA camps with total precision weeks before he did it.
[01:47:33.097 --> 01:47:35.940]  Because I understand the enemy's mind.
[01:47:35.940 --> 01:47:37.781]  That's incredible, actually.
[01:47:37.781 --> 01:47:42.745]  And it's also... You know, I hear that and I'm frightened.
[01:47:42.745 --> 01:47:46.228]  And then that fear is what's actually working against me, because that's what they're trying to do.
[01:47:46.228 --> 01:47:49.952]  They're trying to... When one stares into the abyss, be careful you don't...
[01:47:50.802 --> 01:47:51.983]  Turn into the abyss.
[01:47:51.983 --> 01:47:56.246]  But the good news is, I have turned into the abyss, but I'm still a good guy and have my humanity.
[01:47:56.246 --> 01:48:05.592]  But I am now, literally, psychologically, mentally, I am able to, anytime I want, look into things with their perspective and their grand architecture.
[01:48:05.592 --> 01:48:09.815]  See, now I'm so high up in my study of it that I'm what they would call illuminated.
[01:48:09.815 --> 01:48:11.416]  And I've had elitists tell me that.
[01:48:11.416 --> 01:48:13.998]  Because now I am above the fog.
[01:48:13.998 --> 01:48:14.338]  Right.
[01:48:14.338 --> 01:48:16.360]  I now see a thousand miles.
[01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:17.520]  Wow.
[01:48:17.520 --> 01:48:18.421]  Well, thank you for that.
[01:48:18.421 --> 01:48:19.481]  That's awesome.
[01:48:19.481 --> 01:48:20.302]  How else?
[01:48:20.302 --> 01:48:26.765]  I mean, you did it and it seems that you have an incredible interior personal strength.
[01:48:26.765 --> 01:48:30.707]  It's just other people need to rise up and do that as well if change will happen.
[01:48:30.707 --> 01:48:31.347]  Is that correct?
[01:48:31.347 --> 01:48:32.087]  Absolutely.
[01:48:32.087 --> 01:48:38.951]  I mean, what I love is reading Thomas Jefferson because I read the exact words I have already thought in my soul.
[01:48:39.912 --> 01:48:41.873]  And see, that's the thing.
[01:48:41.873 --> 01:48:48.635]  The elite are awake and understand the way the universe operates and works, understand the systems, but they use it for evil.
[01:48:48.635 --> 01:48:54.757]  The power is good people, and that's what they're scared of, is actually awakening, okay?
[01:48:54.757 --> 01:48:54.937]  Right.
[01:48:54.937 --> 01:48:55.897]  To the larger system.
[01:48:56.775 --> 01:48:58.256]  And that can happen for anyone?
[01:48:58.256 --> 01:48:58.937]  Any individual?
[01:48:58.937 --> 01:48:59.717]  Yes.
[01:48:59.717 --> 01:49:00.638]  And how hard is that?
[01:49:00.638 --> 01:49:02.920]  I mean, it took you 14 years?
[01:49:02.920 --> 01:49:06.303]  Or when did this shift happen for you?
[01:49:06.303 --> 01:49:09.385]  I always instinctively understood their programs and paradigms.
[01:49:09.385 --> 01:49:11.687]  Everyone actually does, subconsciously.
[01:49:11.687 --> 01:49:17.952]  The brain subconsciously, in scientific experiments, is thousands of times more popular, thousands of times more powerful.
[01:49:20.666 --> 01:49:28.793]  Again, the subconscious mind in major studies, depending on which one you look at, is hundreds to thousands of times more powerful than the conscious mind.
[01:49:28.793 --> 01:49:32.536]  The conscious mind is a tiny focusing of the entire brain power.
[01:49:32.536 --> 01:49:39.102]  The average person is an idiot savant and can do incredible mathematics and things like that.
[01:49:39.102 --> 01:49:41.243]  They just have never discovered how to harness that.
[01:49:41.243 --> 01:49:42.985]  So we all have gifts.
[01:49:42.985 --> 01:49:43.766]  I'm nothing special.
[01:49:44.706 --> 01:49:45.607]  Okay?
[01:49:45.607 --> 01:49:53.533]  It's just that I've studied them so long and really read so many of their own source documents, their own manuals, their own reports, their own systems.
[01:49:53.533 --> 01:49:56.656]  And then it just verifies what I already instinctively knew.
[01:49:56.656 --> 01:49:57.136]  Right.
[01:49:57.136 --> 01:50:02.060]  And it's only been the last two or three years that I've learned to trust my overall understanding and instinct.
[01:50:02.060 --> 01:50:03.721]  Because so many times it's right.
[01:50:03.721 --> 01:50:05.202]  But I still know I have blind spots.
[01:50:05.202 --> 01:50:07.204]  I'm not, you know, all-seeing or something.
[01:50:07.204 --> 01:50:10.706]  It's just that the human brain is unbelievably powerful.
[01:50:10.706 --> 01:50:13.348]  And I have learned how to start really tapping into that.
[01:50:13.348 --> 01:50:13.569]  Wow.
[01:50:14.269 --> 01:50:15.930]  That's pretty cool, actually.
[01:50:15.930 --> 01:50:16.790]  Wow, that's awesome.
[01:50:16.790 --> 01:50:26.175]  You know, this is exactly as we do our documentary and we're going around and we're finding, you know, different people in the UFO world and stuff like that.
[01:50:26.175 --> 01:50:31.038]  And they all have their individual truths that they believe in that.
[01:50:31.038 --> 01:50:36.801]  But it seems that you can sort of find a universal truth that I don't think we've found so far in this documentary.
[01:50:39.790 --> 01:50:43.071]  I mean, I'll give you a big secret when we come back.
[01:50:43.071 --> 01:50:43.811]  Okay.
[01:50:43.811 --> 01:50:45.212]  Awesome.
[01:50:45.212 --> 01:50:47.873]  Because, well, let's wait till after the break.
[01:50:47.873 --> 01:50:50.534]  And I'll reveal something I've never revealed before to you, Dean.
[01:50:50.534 --> 01:50:51.354]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:50:51.354 --> 01:50:51.934]  You bet, buddy.
[01:50:51.934 --> 01:50:53.455]  And hey, anytime you want to talk, just jump in.
[01:50:53.455 --> 01:50:55.215]  But you say you want to interview me, that's what we're doing.
[01:50:55.215 --> 01:50:56.816]  I think it's fun for the audience as well.
[01:50:56.816 --> 01:50:57.456]  Absolutely.
[01:50:57.456 --> 01:50:59.137]  I think everybody wants to know this stuff.
[01:50:59.137 --> 01:50:59.657]  We'll be right back.
[01:51:01.041 --> 01:51:02.342]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:02.342 --> 01:51:07.944]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:07.944 --> 01:51:12.966]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:12.966 --> 01:51:18.528]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:51:18.528 --> 01:51:23.210]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:23.752 --> 01:51:30.876]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:30.876 --> 01:51:31.976]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:31.976 --> 01:51:38.680]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:51:38.680 --> 01:51:41.861]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:41.861 --> 01:51:45.023]  That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:51:45.023 --> 01:51:45.223]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:51:45.223 --> 01:51:45.463]  Remember,
[01:52:01.572 --> 01:52:04.935]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[01:52:04.935 --> 01:52:08.858]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[01:52:08.858 --> 01:52:12.560]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[01:52:12.560 --> 01:52:19.866]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride, and
[01:52:19.946 --> 01:52:20.346]  I think so.

[01:53:01.200 --> 01:53:04.763]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[01:53:04.763 --> 01:53:07.045]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[01:53:07.045 --> 01:53:07.926]  Don't!
[01:53:07.926 --> 01:53:10.929]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[01:53:11.329 --> 01:53:17.093]  Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[01:53:35.006 --> 01:53:36.186]  Herb K. was right.
[01:53:36.186 --> 01:53:39.368]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[01:53:39.368 --> 01:53:40.728]  What have you got to lose?
[01:53:40.728 --> 01:53:44.449]  Stop the calls now, get out of debt, and have more money.
[01:53:44.449 --> 01:53:45.070]  Get Herb K.'

[01:53:49.251 --> 01:53:49.291]  888-352-7726.
[01:54:05.151 --> 01:54:09.213]  Dean Hagelin is our guest in studio and while the time is flying.
[01:54:09.213 --> 01:54:11.273]  Absolutely.
[01:54:11.273 --> 01:54:14.815]  Everything I cover is 100% what I believe the truth to be.
[01:54:14.815 --> 01:54:15.655]  Right.
[01:54:15.655 --> 01:54:19.977]  And I have an amazing track record of being about 95% accurate.
[01:54:19.977 --> 01:54:27.220]  And over 95% of what we cover is from original source documents and statements or it's media propaganda that we are analyzing.
[01:54:28.400 --> 01:54:33.422]  But the big secret is, I actually understand a lot more than I even say.
[01:54:33.422 --> 01:54:44.086]  And I have my views and understanding on things that are seen as more archetypal conspiracy theories, like UFOs, spiritual issues, things like that.
[01:54:45.689 --> 01:54:46.029]  I don't.
[01:55:07.020 --> 01:55:12.864]  All over Texas, renting buildings covertly, blowing them up to scare the public, doing psych warfare tests.
[01:55:12.864 --> 01:55:17.347]  I had Emergency Manager Thomas Sanchez on saying they told him it was for psych warfare.
[01:55:17.347 --> 01:55:20.529]  It's since been declassified, it's an acclimation process.
[01:55:20.529 --> 01:55:28.054]  They've got Marines out running checkpoints for DUI for citizens, saying what's wrong with the stopping drunks, for a PR thing to get their foot in the door.
[01:55:28.054 --> 01:55:31.317]  Oh, the Army, the Marines are here, getting rid of posse commentatus.
[01:55:32.097 --> 01:55:38.831]  If I couldn't get people, when it was going on all over the country, I mean anybody listening has had these drills in their city.
[01:55:38.831 --> 01:55:40.093]  It's happened everywhere.
[01:55:40.093 --> 01:55:41.636]  But then the media would say it didn't happen.
[01:55:42.861 --> 01:55:46.723]  I remember when Delta Force crashed a helicopter in Houston, they said it didn't happen on the news.
[01:55:46.723 --> 01:55:49.224]  And then Soldier of Fortune did a big report exposing it.
[01:55:49.224 --> 01:56:12.397]  So see, if I can't get people to admit that in the health care bill it puts you in prison if you don't get health care when it's in the bill, if I can't get people to read Section 802 of the Patriot Act that states it's for all misdemeanors, any action that endangers human life that's a violation of any federal or state law, then how am I going to get them, how am I going to be able to then get into other things that are more nebulous?
[01:56:12.717 --> 01:56:13.538]  Right.
[01:56:13.538 --> 01:56:16.101]  Be it spiritual or UFO or otherworldly.
[01:56:16.101 --> 01:56:17.923]  Is that what you mean?
[01:56:17.923 --> 01:56:25.632]  So that you are focusing then your larger world picture into the stuff that you can actually get.
[01:56:25.632 --> 01:56:27.614]  The documents that you can get that are sent to you.
[01:56:27.834 --> 01:56:31.859]  All I'm trying to do is to get people to know it's bigger than Democrat-Republican.
[01:56:31.859 --> 01:56:33.501]  It's bigger than black and white.
[01:56:33.501 --> 01:56:38.086]  It's bigger than Europe and America and Asia and Africa and Latin America.
[01:56:38.086 --> 01:56:42.271]  It's bigger than how we're all divided and conquered and played off against each other.
[01:56:42.271 --> 01:56:43.973]  I just want people to know there's more out there.
[01:56:43.973 --> 01:56:45.414]  There's more going on than you know.
[01:56:48.342 --> 01:56:50.946]  Don't let the system get you frustrated and angry and upset.
[01:56:50.946 --> 01:56:52.307]  It's fun to explore this.
[01:56:52.307 --> 01:56:52.988]  It's fun.
[01:56:52.988 --> 01:56:54.510]  I mean, it's fun.
[01:56:54.510 --> 01:56:59.237]  It's kind of fun when the media attacks me and lies about me.
[01:56:59.237 --> 01:57:01.540]  Do you find that fun?
[01:57:01.540 --> 01:57:02.541]  I've learned to make it fun.
[01:57:05.445 --> 01:57:14.471]  It really takes the wind out of their sails because, I mean, it really is almost a psychic thing with a stalker or the government or anybody else.
[01:57:14.471 --> 01:57:17.993]  You know, when the government used to death threat me and do all this other stuff to me, I would just say, bring it on.
[01:57:17.993 --> 01:57:20.635]  You know, I don't want to die, but I'm not afraid to.
[01:57:20.635 --> 01:57:22.216]  And I'm just standing up for what's right.
[01:57:22.216 --> 01:57:24.377]  And they just disappear like phantoms in the morning.
[01:57:24.557 --> 01:57:27.798]  I remember last time we had dinner here in Austin two, three years ago.
[01:57:27.798 --> 01:57:31.759]  There was some corporation here that was threatening you, saying we're on to you.
[01:57:31.759 --> 01:57:33.799]  Do you remember that?
[01:57:33.799 --> 01:57:36.200]  Well, I mean, I can't confirm it was DynCorp.
[01:57:36.200 --> 01:57:38.460]  But DynCorp was in the congressional hearings.
[01:57:38.460 --> 01:57:45.322]  DynCorp, it was admitted, was running giant child kidnapping rings all over the world with the UN.
[01:57:45.322 --> 01:57:46.762]  It was in major papers.
[01:57:46.762 --> 01:57:49.422]  And I was getting very serious death threats over that.
[01:57:49.422 --> 01:57:49.883]  Right.
[01:57:49.883 --> 01:57:51.343]  And then that, you found fun?
[01:57:53.100 --> 01:58:09.027]  Well, I mean, not just saying, hey, they're scum, they're evil, I'm standing up against you, and that means I'm hurting you, that means I'm trying to bring you to justice, that means I'm exposing you, and so... That truth will set you free?
[01:58:09.027 --> 01:58:10.008]  It does, it sets you free.
[01:58:10.008 --> 01:58:11.549]  Wow, that's fantastic.
[01:58:11.549 --> 01:58:12.509]  Well, thanks so much, Alex.
[01:58:14.770 --> 01:58:21.955]  Honored, actually, to have you in the documentary, because I know you're a busy guy, you do the show, and it's actually been really inspirational.
[01:58:21.955 --> 01:58:28.941]  Because up until now, the journey has been, you know, people going into their truth, and some of it becomes really heavy.
[01:58:28.941 --> 01:58:31.182]  When is your documentary coming out?
[01:58:31.182 --> 01:58:35.766]  We're going to finish shooting this summer, and we'll probably be out around October, November.
[01:58:35.766 --> 01:58:37.987]  We'll be going to different film festivals.

[02:00:10.239 --> 02:00:11.800]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.800 --> 02:00:12.740]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.740 --> 02:00:17.563]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.563 --> 02:00:21.606]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.770 --> 02:00:26.291]  Okay, Alex, one more question.
[02:00:26.291 --> 02:00:39.115]  The whole concept of shoot the messenger, you know, that this is the idea that you are bringing this information and that people who are afraid of that or don't want to hear it attack you.
[02:00:39.115 --> 02:00:39.815]  What's your position?
[02:00:39.815 --> 02:00:40.356]  How do you handle that?
[02:00:42.782 --> 02:00:50.751]  Well, I get on the highway every day even though it's the number one cause of death until you hit about 55 and it's cancer and heart attacks.
[02:00:50.751 --> 02:00:52.333]  I put my children in my car.
[02:00:52.333 --> 02:00:55.796]  I seat belt them in and try to drive safe, but still, I mean, I'm...
[02:00:57.082 --> 02:00:58.704]  I mean, I'm endangering their lives.
[02:00:58.704 --> 02:01:01.647]  But that's the danger that goes on in everyday life.
[02:01:01.647 --> 02:01:03.209]  So why wouldn't I take a tax?
[02:01:03.209 --> 02:01:05.191]  Why wouldn't I take physical danger?
[02:01:05.191 --> 02:01:13.761]  Why wouldn't I put myself at risk for liberty and freedom and the adventure of knowing the truth and standing up for the little guy?
[02:01:14.562 --> 02:01:16.343]  Who's being abused?
[02:01:16.343 --> 02:01:18.525]  And I'll go back to what I said earlier.
[02:01:18.525 --> 02:01:21.027]  So many things I've talked about have come true.
[02:01:21.027 --> 02:01:30.215]  So many times when I come out first on day one and say 9-11 is an inside job and lose more than half the radio stations I was on within a couple weeks.
[02:01:30.215 --> 02:01:33.978]  I didn't feel bad when my paycheck went way down and all that.
[02:01:33.978 --> 02:01:35.038]  I told the truth.
[02:01:35.038 --> 02:01:35.859]  I had honor.
[02:01:35.859 --> 02:01:37.360]  I was for real.
[02:01:37.360 --> 02:01:38.461]  When all these so-called other
[02:01:40.089 --> 02:01:43.892]  You know, people and activists, I've seen them all sell out for a bag of peanuts.
[02:01:43.892 --> 02:01:51.037]  You know, to me, telling the truth is what's truly honorable, and then being successful doing it my way.
[02:01:51.037 --> 02:01:53.758]  You know, that makes it that much better.
[02:01:53.758 --> 02:01:55.600]  There's no blood on my hands.
[02:01:55.600 --> 02:02:05.386]  And so I really feel good, and I'm trying to teach other people how to have courage and stand up against tyranny, and that doesn't mean that they have to all have my view or my idea.
[02:02:05.386 --> 02:02:06.787]  One of the few painful things
[02:02:07.796 --> 02:02:16.928]  But I've even learned to understand that, that you're going to cast seeds out and some are going to fall on the rocks, some are going to fall into the water, some are going to fall into the good dirt, but not
[02:02:17.737 --> 02:02:18.497]  Sprout.
[02:02:18.497 --> 02:02:23.679]  It's a very small percentage that are going to get into the dirt and really grow into beautiful oak trees.
[02:02:23.679 --> 02:02:25.880]  And so, I'm throwing out all this seed.
[02:02:25.880 --> 02:02:28.921]  I've woken up conservatively probably 100 million people worldwide.
[02:02:28.921 --> 02:02:34.463]  My films have been seen more than 200 million times online that we know of for free.
[02:02:34.463 --> 02:02:36.443]  The media can never understand that when I tell them that.
[02:02:36.443 --> 02:02:37.343]  It's free!
[02:02:37.343 --> 02:02:39.704]  It's free because I want the people to wake up.
[02:02:39.704 --> 02:02:42.505]  The global is trafficking the men's souls.
[02:02:42.505 --> 02:02:44.346]  The global is trafficking the souls of men.
[02:02:45.446 --> 02:02:53.308]  And I traffic in trying to save those souls from being pre-programmed and never really flourishing.
[02:02:53.308 --> 02:02:59.669]  And so I can't expect it that if I wake up a bunch of people, some of them are going to go off and do bad things.
[02:02:59.669 --> 02:03:00.829]  Some of them are going to do good things.
[02:03:00.829 --> 02:03:02.370]  Some of them are going to do great things.
[02:03:02.370 --> 02:03:03.770]  Some of them are going to do nothing.
[02:03:03.770 --> 02:03:10.852]  Some of them are going to turn against me and become agents of evil and agents of weakness and agents of corruption and agents of greed.
[02:03:10.852 --> 02:03:12.472]  But that's the way it works.
[02:03:13.152 --> 02:03:26.819]  And so, I feel sadness for them, just like I feel sadness for the public who will never hear this message of truth, or will hear it and dust themselves off when they've been hit by the truth and, you know, keep on walking down the road.
[02:03:26.819 --> 02:03:32.842]  As Churchill said, everybody gets run in... everyone runs into the truth in their life at one time or another.
[02:03:33.542 --> 02:03:37.086]  But most people get knocked over by it, get up, dust themselves off.
[02:03:37.086 --> 02:03:38.308]  I didn't do that.
[02:03:38.308 --> 02:03:43.834]  And so I've been awake since I was a child to the wonder, to the majesty, to the magic of the world.
[02:03:43.834 --> 02:03:47.338]  And I think it's because I had that poetic loving heart.
[02:03:48.880 --> 02:03:52.804]  That I was able early on to also see the bad.
[02:03:52.804 --> 02:04:04.418]  It's because I see the good and the beauty and the innocence and the honor and everything pure that I'm also able to then see the things that are dark and degenerate and dangerous and aberrant and bad.
[02:04:04.418 --> 02:04:06.180]  And look into that abyss as you said earlier.
[02:04:06.440 --> 02:04:07.501]  Yes, look into that abyss.
[02:04:22.901 --> 02:04:25.662]  You know, it seems overwhelming, all this information.
[02:04:25.662 --> 02:04:32.103]  Well, that's the system trying to crush your humanity, trying to overwhelm you, trying to... It's called learned helplessness.
[02:04:32.103 --> 02:04:37.665]  They've done it with dogs and rats and other mammals, where they shock them and torture them in a cage.
[02:04:37.665 --> 02:04:41.446]  Every time they try to get their food, they get shocked, so they just give up and go in the corner and die.
[02:04:41.946 --> 02:04:42.966]  No.
[02:04:42.966 --> 02:04:45.667]  We're not a dog or a rat trapped in a cage.
[02:04:45.667 --> 02:04:49.189]  We can break out of the cage and go against our controllers.
[02:04:49.189 --> 02:04:59.152]  The whole world is a giant mad scientist laboratory where they're trying to harness and dominate and dehumanize humanity because they're threatened by that dynamic human spirit.
[02:04:59.152 --> 02:04:59.673]  They hate it.
[02:04:59.673 --> 02:05:00.433]  They want to destroy it.
[02:05:01.345 --> 02:05:04.346]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:05:04.346 --> 02:05:09.689]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:05:09.689 --> 02:05:11.730]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:05:11.730 --> 02:05:16.732]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:05:16.732 --> 02:05:17.913]  How much do you want?
[02:05:17.913 --> 02:05:19.033]  When do you want it?
[02:05:19.033 --> 02:05:20.934]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:05:20.934 --> 02:05:21.995]  When will you need it?
[02:05:21.995 --> 02:05:24.196]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:05:24.196 --> 02:05:25.536]  Will there be any food?
[02:05:25.536 --> 02:05:26.837]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:05:27.057 --> 02:05:32.322]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:05:32.322 --> 02:05:35.906]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:05:35.906 --> 02:05:39.730]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:05:39.730 --> 02:05:40.971]  How much will you need?
[02:05:40.971 --> 02:05:41.872]  We don't know.
[02:05:41.872 --> 02:05:42.973]  How much do you want?
[02:05:42.973 --> 02:05:43.714]  All you can get.
[02:05:43.714 --> 02:05:44.715]  I'm Alex Jones.

[02:08:25.990 --> 02:08:28.991]  Bob Chapman coming up here in just a few minutes.
[02:08:28.991 --> 02:08:31.232]  See, Dean, I also have a long view of history.
[02:08:31.232 --> 02:08:31.672]  Right.
[02:08:31.672 --> 02:08:32.393]  I know that...
[02:08:33.644 --> 02:08:36.806]  I could get killed, set up, jailed, destroyed in the media.
[02:08:36.806 --> 02:08:37.467]  Doesn't matter.
[02:08:37.467 --> 02:08:38.748]  I did my work.
[02:08:38.748 --> 02:08:40.109]  I've woken up a bunch of people.
[02:08:40.109 --> 02:08:42.130]  I've gotten them to think outside the box.
[02:08:42.130 --> 02:08:46.393]  Many of the terms that I developed to describe the planet are now in common use.
[02:08:46.393 --> 02:08:47.794]  And I'm not even credited with most of it.
[02:08:47.794 --> 02:08:48.615]  People are using it.
[02:08:48.615 --> 02:08:52.718]  Another example of the human potential, human power, that everybody has.
[02:08:53.118 --> 02:09:04.229]  And so I know whether it's 10 years, 20 years, 30 years down the road, my work will just continue on if even I, the image, or the, you know, an icon of this, is destroyed.
[02:09:04.229 --> 02:09:06.431]  Because it'll just be reborn later.
[02:09:06.431 --> 02:09:10.915]  And so it's that unselfishness that conquers evil.
[02:09:10.915 --> 02:09:12.677]  And it's also recognizing there is evil.
[02:09:13.097 --> 02:09:14.478]  You know, there is corruption.
[02:09:14.478 --> 02:09:18.860]  There are psychopaths that see death and destruction and a pile of dead bodies as beautiful.
[02:09:18.860 --> 02:09:35.049]  You and I think a Colorado vista and snow-capped mountains and a beautiful woman, you know, with us that we're, you know, having a great day together and a glass of wine and, you know, happiness and fields of flowers and driving past happy, you know, farmhouses and orchards.
[02:09:35.049 --> 02:09:36.970]  That buoys our soul.
[02:09:36.970 --> 02:09:41.193]  But the criminal psychopath, the high-functioning, sadistic psychopath,
[02:09:41.633 --> 02:09:43.774]  They enjoy domination control.
[02:09:43.774 --> 02:09:47.435]  In fact, I want to read this on air for your peace.
[02:09:47.435 --> 02:09:53.998]  Can you guys print me the two Orwell passages that I read earlier in the week?
[02:09:53.998 --> 02:09:55.559]  Can you guys dig them up?
[02:09:55.559 --> 02:10:01.221]  One of the... and if we can't find it now, I will read it outside during a break to you guys.
[02:10:01.861 --> 02:10:07.708]  Uh, where we describe the enemy, where O'Brien is, uh, torturing Winston.
[02:10:07.708 --> 02:10:08.148]  Yeah.
[02:10:08.148 --> 02:10:12.793]  And, uh, just, just 1984, uh, priest of power will pull it up.
[02:10:12.793 --> 02:10:14.815]  Uh, that'll give you the passages.
[02:10:14.815 --> 02:10:15.976]  Uh, also, uh, 1984.
[02:10:19.760 --> 02:10:21.881]  Trampling and being trampled on.
[02:10:21.881 --> 02:10:22.262]  Right.
[02:10:22.262 --> 02:10:24.163]  See, because to them it's all about power.
[02:10:24.163 --> 02:10:32.609]  It's just the continued triumph, the domination of goodness, the evil society working together.
[02:10:32.609 --> 02:10:35.772]  Because all that's good to them is very ugly.
[02:10:35.772 --> 02:10:36.132]  Right.
[02:10:36.132 --> 02:10:38.374]  And so they're seeking to tear it down and destroy it.
[02:10:38.374 --> 02:10:40.035]  And that's from fear?
[02:10:40.035 --> 02:10:42.357]  Or is it just the psychopathic mind?
[02:10:42.597 --> 02:10:45.878]  Well, they do have a lot of fearful control freaks that also serve them.
[02:10:45.878 --> 02:10:49.759]  But at the very top, they're psychos.
[02:10:49.759 --> 02:10:54.700]  And a lot of psychopathic tendencies are in families.
[02:10:54.700 --> 02:10:56.300]  And you have a lot of elites inbreeding.
[02:10:56.300 --> 02:11:00.981]  When you have inbreeding, psychopathic tendencies, megalomania tends to manifest.
[02:11:00.981 --> 02:11:06.103]  You notice these elite families have been inbreeding for centuries in Europe, thousands of years total.
[02:11:06.103 --> 02:11:11.404]  And so they are a different group of people in many respects from the general population.
[02:11:11.564 --> 02:11:21.850]  Wow, well that's sad because I come from Swedish royalty myself and I shouldn't perhaps let everyone know that that's in my system.
[02:11:21.850 --> 02:11:23.371]  But thanks again, you know.
[02:11:23.371 --> 02:11:25.152]  Well there have been some good kings too.
[02:11:25.152 --> 02:11:26.753]  Yeah, yeah, a couple.
[02:11:26.753 --> 02:11:30.475]  But we can trace our, the Haglund family line goes back to King Eric XIV who was
[02:11:33.377 --> 02:11:34.537]  Yeah, he was a little crazy.
[02:11:34.537 --> 02:11:49.963]  I think most of us who have got European ancestors, I mean, almost everybody out there has quite a bit, because there's been so many other royal houses, and Germany had something like 20 different principalities in it, each one had a king over it.
[02:11:49.963 --> 02:11:52.664]  Right, right, and there were smaller and smaller empires.
[02:11:52.664 --> 02:11:59.366]  Absolutely, I mean, it's ridiculous if you look at my family line, how many people, but I mean,
[02:12:01.001 --> 02:12:02.482]  I've got a lot of ancestors from England.
[02:12:02.482 --> 02:12:02.722]  Yeah.
[02:12:02.722 --> 02:12:05.983]  But, you know, German royals, but that's all a dime a dozen.
[02:12:05.983 --> 02:12:10.906]  I mean, everybody's related to those people if they're European.
[02:12:10.906 --> 02:12:18.009]  And most groups, I mean, most people who are from Mexico, I guarantee you have got some bloodline going back to Aztec kings.
[02:12:18.009 --> 02:12:18.829]  Oh, right.
[02:12:18.829 --> 02:12:25.532]  I mean, if you study bloodlines, it's like my mom's side of the family, two people in the Mayflower, my dad's side directly to Captain Jones.
[02:12:27.353 --> 02:12:27.994]  That's cool.
[02:12:27.994 --> 02:12:28.654]  It just goes on.
[02:12:28.654 --> 02:12:30.215]  That's where the Jones names come from?
[02:12:30.215 --> 02:12:31.196]  From Captain Jones?
[02:12:31.196 --> 02:12:31.396]  Yeah.
[02:12:31.396 --> 02:12:32.117]  The Explorer?
[02:12:32.117 --> 02:12:32.477]  Yeah.
[02:12:32.477 --> 02:12:33.818]  You could trace it all the way back?
[02:12:33.818 --> 02:12:34.258]  Yeah.
[02:12:34.258 --> 02:12:34.879]  Wow.
[02:12:34.879 --> 02:12:35.759]  That's pretty cool.
[02:12:35.759 --> 02:12:38.521]  It's odd that you're now exploring still.
[02:12:38.521 --> 02:12:40.263]  I think all humans explore though, Dean.
[02:12:40.263 --> 02:12:40.723]  Oh, really?
[02:12:40.723 --> 02:12:43.645]  I'm finding some that don't, actually.
[02:12:43.645 --> 02:12:47.368]  Well, I mean, there are some people, well, they want to explore the football scores.
[02:12:47.368 --> 02:12:47.848]  Yeah.
[02:12:47.848 --> 02:12:49.970]  They want to explore the topless bars.
[02:12:49.970 --> 02:12:53.692]  They want to explore, uh, me, I mean, I want to explore the mysteries of the world.
[02:12:53.692 --> 02:12:54.473]  The mysteries of the universe.
[02:12:54.693 --> 02:12:56.794]  Well, yeah, and you certainly have on this show.
[02:12:56.794 --> 02:13:00.475]  Do we have Bob Chapman?
[02:13:00.475 --> 02:13:00.795]  Okay, good.
[02:13:00.795 --> 02:13:01.496]  We asked him to call in at 15.
[02:13:01.496 --> 02:13:02.856]  I just want to make sure.
[02:13:02.856 --> 02:13:04.457]  Dean, I wanted to talk about you.
[02:13:04.457 --> 02:13:06.217]  You're doing a lot of TV shows right now.
[02:13:06.217 --> 02:13:06.958]  That's right.
[02:13:06.958 --> 02:13:09.018]  I just did an episode of Bones.
[02:13:09.018 --> 02:13:17.962]  I also have a weekly podcast called the Chill Pack Hollywood Hour, of course, with my co-producer Phil Larness, and we talk about basically
[02:13:18.962 --> 02:13:23.703]  Filmmaking and also what it's like to make a documentary.
[02:13:23.703 --> 02:13:26.064]  And you can find that at ChillPackHollywood.com.
[02:13:26.064 --> 02:13:33.666]  And of course by ChillPack, which you know, the laptop cooling system that I believe I gave to you as a gift when I was here a couple years ago.
[02:13:33.666 --> 02:13:34.206]  Absolutely!
[02:13:34.206 --> 02:13:39.087]  Yeah, it goes right under your laptop in the freezer underneath the laptop and cools it down.
[02:13:39.087 --> 02:13:41.288]  You can get that at ChillPack.com.
[02:13:41.288 --> 02:13:43.749]  C-H-I-L-L-P-A-K dot com.
[02:13:45.549 --> 02:13:47.390]  You know, that's selling around the world.
[02:13:47.390 --> 02:13:49.592]  So I've been really busy, actually.
[02:13:49.592 --> 02:13:54.255]  I can't find my 1984 stuff that I was reading earlier in the week.
[02:13:54.255 --> 02:13:56.037]  It's the trampled and being trampled on.
[02:13:57.759 --> 02:13:58.580]  We're getting it.
[02:13:58.580 --> 02:13:59.240]  We're getting it.
[02:13:59.240 --> 02:14:00.641]  The problem is, I have so much stuff.
[02:14:00.641 --> 02:14:01.282]  This is like... I know.
[02:14:01.282 --> 02:14:03.243]  Well, this is one day of stuff.
[02:14:03.243 --> 02:14:04.304]  This is just one day?
[02:14:04.304 --> 02:14:04.864]  This is one day.
[02:14:04.864 --> 02:14:09.388]  Well, those magazines have been there for about a month, but no, all of this, all, well, I mean, this is just, look.
[02:14:09.388 --> 02:14:10.169]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:14:10.169 --> 02:14:13.931]  This is just a smattering of one trip to the grocery store.
[02:14:13.931 --> 02:14:17.434]  Falling fertility, how population problem is solving itself.
[02:14:17.434 --> 02:14:18.415]  That's just in the economy.
[02:14:19.116 --> 02:14:23.239]  And it says fertility is falling astonishingly fast and that's bringing big benefits.
[02:14:23.239 --> 02:14:25.561]  Less people's good.
[02:14:25.561 --> 02:14:32.088]  Here they are saying the heir of the Rothschild fortune is the hero gene and it says that he may be basically Jesus.
[02:14:33.268 --> 02:14:33.988]  Good God.
[02:14:33.988 --> 02:14:38.631]  And then it says Al Gore is an eco-prophet, and, you know, stuff like that.
[02:14:38.631 --> 02:14:42.973]  And then they've got our heroes for us, not people who stand up against tyranny.
[02:14:42.973 --> 02:14:45.314]  No, it's got to be Colt McCoy.
[02:14:45.314 --> 02:14:48.616]  So see, I mean, you know, just a quick smattering there.
[02:14:48.616 --> 02:14:54.499]  This is an outside magazine talking about the hero gene, and this is rather shocking.
[02:14:54.499 --> 02:14:57.521]  I thought you'd have to find this in much more obscure publications.
[02:14:58.194 --> 02:15:05.024]  No, it's just, they have billboards up when we were in Los Angeles doing some interviews and just worshiping David Rothschild.
[02:15:06.089 --> 02:15:06.890]  He's just going to save us.
[02:15:06.890 --> 02:15:09.131]  We're going to pay our carbon taxes directly to him.
[02:15:09.131 --> 02:15:11.152]  He owns one of the major carbon trading systems.
[02:15:11.152 --> 02:15:11.732]  Oh, you're kidding.
[02:15:11.732 --> 02:15:12.873]  Isn't he gracious?
[02:15:12.873 --> 02:15:13.814]  To save us?
[02:15:13.814 --> 02:15:15.475]  That's amazing.
[02:15:15.475 --> 02:15:18.897]  And by the way, when he was on my radio show, because people can get these big folks on there.
[02:15:18.897 --> 02:15:20.558]  How did Alex get him on?
[02:15:20.558 --> 02:15:21.859]  That's another big conspiracy.
[02:15:21.859 --> 02:15:30.304]  Well, he had a book for kids teaching them that polar bears were drowning, literally, and that we had to have a global carbon tax and he would save us that the public school system was buying for kids.
[02:15:31.084 --> 02:15:36.408]  So we call up the publisher, and we go, we're a large syndicated radio show, we'd like to have you on about your book.
[02:15:36.408 --> 02:15:38.250]  And so they had him lined up at interviews all day.
[02:15:38.250 --> 02:15:42.193]  He was supposed to come on for 10 minutes, but I challenged him, he was on for about 45.
[02:15:42.193 --> 02:15:50.139]  And he was so arrogant, Dean, he was so arrogant to everybody that...
[02:15:51.863 --> 02:15:55.424]  He would say, number one, there's no plan on carbon taxes, that that's a conspiracy.
[02:15:55.424 --> 02:15:59.965]  Then two years later, he came out and said it was good, we all needed taxes, the carbon tax.
[02:15:59.965 --> 02:16:03.146]  And then I said, well, why are the ice caps on Mars melting?
[02:16:03.146 --> 02:16:08.528]  And why are some of the moons of Jupiter and Saturn melting, that were liquid, methane and other things?
[02:16:08.528 --> 02:16:11.729]  And he said, oh, because they're now closer to the sun.
[02:16:12.749 --> 02:16:14.970]  They're closer to the Sun than the Earth.
[02:16:14.970 --> 02:16:23.175]  And I said, no, it goes Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, and then out to the gas giants, all the way out to Pluto.
[02:16:23.175 --> 02:16:26.937]  And he just said, no, that's not true, and laughed.
[02:16:26.937 --> 02:16:29.859]  In his religion, it's about
[02:16:30.579 --> 02:16:31.640]  The religion of the elite.
[02:16:31.640 --> 02:16:31.960]  Yeah.
[02:16:31.960 --> 02:16:34.502]  It's about contempt for the general population.
[02:16:34.502 --> 02:16:42.808]  It's about thinking my audience was so dumb that he would come on and say no, the ice caps are melting because those planets are closer to the sun than the earth.
[02:16:43.510 --> 02:16:44.170]  Wow.
[02:16:44.170 --> 02:16:51.535]  But even if he meant that, no, planets have gotten closer to the Sun, well then that's also what's making the Earth hotter.
[02:16:51.535 --> 02:16:54.137]  But in truth, the Sun had just heated up.
[02:16:54.137 --> 02:16:55.838]  It's the main giver of heat in life.
[02:16:55.838 --> 02:16:56.399]  Right.
[02:16:56.399 --> 02:17:02.142]  Some, you know, underground magma touching the ocean and coming out, that creates some geothermal.
[02:17:02.142 --> 02:17:07.246]  But most of it, I mean literally billions of times more in the equations I've seen, comes from the Sun.
[02:17:07.506 --> 02:17:08.127]  Yeah.
[02:17:08.127 --> 02:17:10.369]  And they say, no, that's a conspiracy theory.
[02:17:10.369 --> 02:17:20.480]  And the IPCC at the UN that runs this whole global warming fraud, they openly say that it's a conspiracy theory to say the sun affects earth temperature.
[02:17:21.280 --> 02:17:22.921]  You can pull up the headlines right now.
[02:17:22.921 --> 02:17:23.942]  Google this.
[02:17:23.942 --> 02:17:27.064]  UN says sun not affecting climate.
[02:17:27.064 --> 02:17:31.646]  And you will get them announcing they say, Dean, the sun doesn't affect.
[02:17:31.646 --> 02:17:34.588]  When the earth's tilted towards the sun, you get summer.
[02:17:34.588 --> 02:17:35.328]  No.
[02:17:35.328 --> 02:17:35.969]  That's not it.
[02:17:35.969 --> 02:17:36.509]  No.
[02:17:36.509 --> 02:17:38.090]  That's geothermal.
[02:17:38.090 --> 02:17:39.011]  Yes, it's your breath.
[02:17:39.871 --> 02:17:41.432]  You did it, Dean!
[02:17:41.432 --> 02:17:42.333]  You're bad!
[02:17:42.333 --> 02:17:43.333]  I shouldn't be exhaling.
[02:17:43.333 --> 02:17:48.077]  Listen, there were only 20-something thousand two decades ago polar bears, which are still a large population.
[02:17:48.077 --> 02:17:48.477]  Yeah.
[02:17:48.477 --> 02:17:52.499]  And all the major archaeological studies they've done show that when it does heat up, there's more of them.
[02:17:52.499 --> 02:17:52.760]  Okay?
[02:17:52.760 --> 02:17:56.762]  Because they almost die in the winter, and then they only eat during the summer.
[02:17:56.762 --> 02:18:01.885]  So the warmer it is, and it was getting a little bit warmer for a while, it's a natural up-and-down cycle, they were doing a lot better.
[02:18:01.885 --> 02:18:07.129]  Now, unfortunately, it's getting colder again, so the population of polar bears will start going down, according to the historical record.
[02:18:07.669 --> 02:18:08.830]  Uh, but they just tell people no.
[02:18:08.830 --> 02:18:13.834]  I mean, my son has textbooks and stuff that say the polar bears are all dying, Dean.
[02:18:13.834 --> 02:18:16.056]  And they're dying because of the global warming.
[02:18:16.056 --> 02:18:17.277]  And they say penguins can't swim.
[02:18:17.277 --> 02:18:19.839]  I'm not kidding.
[02:18:19.839 --> 02:18:20.240]  Really?
[02:18:20.240 --> 02:18:21.361]  They say penguins are going to drown.
[02:18:22.421 --> 02:18:25.764]  They're, well... It's an aquatic bird.
[02:18:25.764 --> 02:18:26.504]  It's an aquatic bird.
[02:18:26.504 --> 02:18:27.946]  I saw March of the Penguins.
[02:18:27.946 --> 02:18:29.927]  They don't do very well on land, it seems.
[02:18:29.927 --> 02:18:32.269]  No, they have contests in public schools.
[02:18:32.269 --> 02:18:38.834]  I was even down in Port Aransas at a pizza place, and on the wall, they had all the little kids' pictures they'd drawn, saying, please save the penguins, they're gonna drown.
[02:18:38.834 --> 02:18:41.316]  And they had the kids all do that, and the kids love penguins.
[02:18:41.316 --> 02:18:43.078]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:18:43.078 --> 02:18:44.158]  Wow.
[02:18:44.158 --> 02:18:44.579]  Wow.
[02:18:44.579 --> 02:18:45.600]  It just never ends, does it?
[02:18:46.340 --> 02:18:49.142]  So tell us, what TV shows are you doing right now?
[02:18:49.142 --> 02:18:57.508]  You will see me, other than the Bones episode, I'm working on a show for Discovery, a conspiracy show.
[02:18:57.508 --> 02:19:00.550]  Sort of like Jesse Ventura's, a little more fun, though.
[02:19:00.550 --> 02:19:05.494]  I love Jesse's show, but he's coming at it a bit... You're doing a conspiracy show for what?
[02:19:05.934 --> 02:19:08.355]  Uh, we're looking to get it on Discovery Channel.
[02:19:08.355 --> 02:19:10.257]  Oh, so this is separate?
[02:19:10.257 --> 02:19:11.057]  This is a separate thing.
[02:19:11.057 --> 02:19:14.899]  This is going to be for theatrical and DVD release.
[02:19:14.899 --> 02:19:18.761]  But it'll be another show similar to that where I explore these kind of things.
[02:19:18.761 --> 02:19:19.982]  Gonna come interview us?
[02:19:19.982 --> 02:19:21.683]  I would love to, if you have me!
[02:19:22.023 --> 02:19:22.644]  Absolutely.
[02:19:22.644 --> 02:19:28.351]  My only issue is Discovery Channel did a five-part series with me and shelved it because it was too hardcore like Ventura's.
[02:19:28.351 --> 02:19:28.611]  Oh, really?
[02:19:28.611 --> 02:19:30.674]  So they're gonna want you to look into chupacabras and stuff?
[02:19:30.674 --> 02:19:32.476]  Yeah, yeah, all sorts of stuff.
[02:19:32.476 --> 02:19:37.502]  I went and looked with Dr. Roger Lear at some alien implants that he had removed.
[02:19:37.502 --> 02:19:38.944]  Next episode, Vampire!
[02:19:39.524 --> 02:19:39.805]  Yeah.
[02:19:39.805 --> 02:19:41.726]  Episode after that, Loch Ness Monster.
[02:19:41.726 --> 02:19:42.046]  Yeah.
[02:19:42.046 --> 02:19:44.508]  And then, Net Yeti, the Abominable Snowman.
[02:19:44.508 --> 02:19:48.251]  Maybe some of that, but yeah, it'll be sort of that kind of thing.
[02:19:48.251 --> 02:19:53.455]  And of course, you know, I do stand-up comedy, so I'm still performing live all over North America and all over the world.
[02:19:53.455 --> 02:19:57.758]  Well, Dean, you are kicking butt, and I'm not trying to be mean, I just knew I could guess what Discovery's gonna let you do.
[02:19:57.758 --> 02:19:59.799]  Hey, but you're doing this documentary, that is good.
[02:19:59.799 --> 02:20:00.380]  That is good.
[02:20:00.380 --> 02:20:01.120]  Dean Hagelin.
[02:20:01.120 --> 02:20:08.586]  AirandAqua.com is your one-stop shop for some of the most affordable air and water purification systems available on the market today.
[02:20:08.866 --> 02:20:13.151]  AaronAqua.com knows exactly what doesn't belong in our air and our water.
[02:20:13.151 --> 02:20:17.455]  And they know exactly how to help you rid your home or office of these harmful toxins.
[02:20:17.455 --> 02:20:22.220]  Did you know that your skin actually absorbs more chlorine while you shower than from the water you drink?
[02:20:22.220 --> 02:20:25.904]  AaronAqua.com can help you eliminate dangerous chlorine from your water.
[02:20:25.904 --> 02:20:30.269]  AaronAqua.com carries atmospheric water generators, glass water bottles,
[02:20:30.509 --> 02:20:31.049]  I think so.
[02:21:00.874 --> 02:21:03.135]  Good day, Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[02:21:03.135 --> 02:21:03.535]  January 29, 2010.
[02:21:03.535 --> 02:21:04.575]  Gold opened this morning at $10.86.70.
[02:21:04.575 --> 02:21:08.097]  A one ounce gold coin can be purchased for $11.16.59, $5.58.30 for a half ounce, or $2.79.15 for the quarter ounce.
[02:21:08.097 --> 02:21:08.677]  That's $11.16.59, $5.58.30, and $2.79.15.
[02:21:20.661 --> 02:21:34.272]  How is it that we the people grow the cotton, weave it into fabric, engrave the ink, embed the strips and fibers that protect it from counterfeit, then cart the money off to a privately owned bank to have it lent back to us at interest, forcing us to pay taxes to service the debt?
[02:21:34.272 --> 02:21:35.533]  Is this capitalism?
[02:21:35.533 --> 02:21:43.120]  Or was Jefferson correct when he said, a central bank issuing a public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[02:21:43.120 --> 02:21:44.221]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[02:21:44.221 --> 02:21:48.344]  I'm placing a silver dollar inside of a book that explains how the monetary system works.
[02:21:48.564 --> 02:21:52.546]  Call for your copy 1-800-686-2237.
[02:21:52.546 --> 02:21:54.467]  Isn't it time to understand the system?
[02:21:54.467 --> 02:21:57.708]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:21:57.708 --> 02:22:02.310]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:22:02.310 --> 02:22:06.312]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:22:06.312 --> 02:22:09.573]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:22:09.573 --> 02:22:10.974]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[02:22:11.881 --> 02:22:15.124]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:22:15.124 --> 02:22:20.750]  Tremendous influence on our president and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:22:20.750 --> 02:22:25.935]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:22:25.935 --> 02:22:35.924]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:22:36.044 --> 02:22:38.386]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:22:38.386 --> 02:22:39.987]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:22:39.987 --> 02:22:42.428]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:22:42.428 --> 02:22:44.289]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:22:44.289 --> 02:22:49.713]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:22:49.713 --> 02:22:54.736]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[02:22:54.736 --> 02:23:02.421]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:23:02.421 --> 02:23:04.583]  Our economy is in great distress.
[02:23:05.316 --> 02:23:08.838]  The financial dominoes can fall at any time.
[02:23:08.838 --> 02:23:14.362]  It's time to stop hoping it doesn't happen and prepare just in case it does.
[02:23:14.362 --> 02:23:17.023]  You have auto and home insurance.
[02:23:17.023 --> 02:23:20.246]  Why wouldn't you have food insurance?
[02:23:20.246 --> 02:23:23.528]  Are you prepared to feed your family long term?
[02:23:23.528 --> 02:23:26.189]  Because it might take years to recover.
[02:23:26.189 --> 02:23:31.853]  As the adult, it's your responsibility to feed your family, especially during rough times.
[02:23:32.711 --> 02:23:40.057]  SurvivalistSeeds.com is offering a package that will give you a 3-acre heirloom vegetable garden anywhere.
[02:23:40.057 --> 02:23:48.164]  50 heirloom varieties, 8,000 vegetable seeds, over 5 pounds of healthy food.
[02:23:48.164 --> 02:23:52.647]  Don't be fooled by marketing companies disguised as patriots.
[02:23:52.647 --> 02:23:58.472]  SurvivalistSeeds.com is owned by Big John Lipscomb, host of Don't Tread on Me radio show.
[02:24:07.128 --> 02:24:09.729]  We're going to Bob Chapman here in a moment.
[02:24:09.729 --> 02:24:11.510]  We appreciate him joining us today.
[02:24:11.510 --> 02:24:13.811]  Dean Hagelin is here with us for a minute or two left.
[02:24:13.811 --> 02:24:17.432]  He told me, is it okay to talk about the production company?
[02:24:17.432 --> 02:24:18.713]  No, I'm not going to do it.
[02:24:18.713 --> 02:24:19.953]  I'm not going to do it.
[02:24:19.953 --> 02:24:21.694]  I'm not going to do it.
[02:24:21.694 --> 02:24:23.655]  I just watched your six there, buddy.
[02:24:23.655 --> 02:24:24.635]  But man, you're doing so much.
[02:24:24.635 --> 02:24:26.296]  You're doing a bunch of TV shows, movies.
[02:24:26.296 --> 02:24:27.016]  I mean, you're busy.
[02:24:27.016 --> 02:24:27.776]  I'm very busy, yeah.
[02:24:27.776 --> 02:24:28.937]  There's a lot of independent stuff.
[02:24:28.937 --> 02:24:34.779]  I just shot a movie called Atlantis Down, but the Space Shuttle has shot that, so that'll be coming out this year.
[02:24:36.480 --> 02:24:38.522]  A couple of other, you know, these independent productions.
[02:24:38.522 --> 02:24:40.483]  Hollywood is changing the way it's doing business.
[02:24:40.483 --> 02:24:42.124]  There's a shifting sand going on there.
[02:24:42.124 --> 02:24:44.286]  What did you think of Ventura's television show?
[02:24:44.286 --> 02:24:46.768]  I liked it a lot and it was great to see you on it.
[02:24:46.768 --> 02:24:51.512]  I think it's great the way his research team actually follows the research.
[02:24:51.512 --> 02:24:54.594]  So they all follow it down the rabbit hole, which a lot of shows didn't do.
[02:24:54.594 --> 02:24:55.795]  It's almost like Perry Mason.
[02:24:55.795 --> 02:25:01.659]  Kind of like Perry Mason, where you uncover layer after layer of an onion until you get to something.
[02:25:02.920 --> 02:25:04.521]  Got top ratings on TruTV.
[02:25:04.521 --> 02:25:05.302]  Is that right?
[02:25:05.302 --> 02:25:06.023]  I think he's great.
[02:25:06.023 --> 02:25:11.426]  I mean, sometimes he seems to be coming in with, like, his mind already set, and then he just finds the information.
[02:25:11.426 --> 02:25:14.168]  Yeah, but that's the first time it's been from our perspective.
[02:25:14.168 --> 02:25:14.709]  It's true.
[02:25:14.709 --> 02:25:15.990]  No, no, I was behind the scenes.
[02:25:15.990 --> 02:25:17.591]  Ventura would really go check it out.
[02:25:17.591 --> 02:25:18.011]  Oh, he would?
[02:25:18.011 --> 02:25:20.293]  I mean, Maury Strong really does want to destroy civilization.
[02:25:20.293 --> 02:25:21.334]  He says that.
[02:25:21.334 --> 02:25:22.474]  Global warming is a fraud.
[02:25:22.474 --> 02:25:29.520]  They already exposed the fraud before ClimateGate even came out and got Bill Sanford to admit the UN fudged the reports.
[02:25:29.520 --> 02:25:29.800]  Really?
[02:25:30.180 --> 02:25:37.023]  So that's great to hear, but I often think, oh, I got access because I was in the government.
[02:25:37.023 --> 02:25:38.244]  I got access to all sorts of things.
[02:25:38.244 --> 02:25:41.866]  No, Ventura, I'm telling you, Ventura four years ago was arguing with me.
[02:25:41.866 --> 02:25:42.226]  Was he?
[02:25:42.226 --> 02:25:42.966]  About this stuff.
[02:25:42.966 --> 02:25:44.687]  No, he really went out and checked it out.
[02:25:44.687 --> 02:25:46.668]  He believed global warming at the start of the episode.
[02:25:47.577 --> 02:25:48.258]  Oh yeah, that's right.
[02:25:48.258 --> 02:25:50.159]  And then he... I mean, that's real!
[02:25:50.159 --> 02:25:51.780]  They really sit around screaming at each other.
[02:25:51.780 --> 02:25:52.661]  I've been in that room.
[02:25:52.661 --> 02:25:53.301]  Is that right?
[02:25:53.301 --> 02:25:53.461]  Yeah.
[02:25:53.461 --> 02:25:55.563]  Because I don't know any of those other researchers on that show.
[02:25:55.563 --> 02:25:56.924]  They just sit around screaming at each other.
[02:25:56.924 --> 02:25:59.586]  One of them's his son, who's one of the guys that woke him up.
[02:25:59.586 --> 02:25:59.906]  Oh yeah?
[02:25:59.906 --> 02:26:01.507]  I mean, that's real.
[02:26:01.507 --> 02:26:04.730]  I mean, you know, they have some stuff where, you know, we gotta have a different shot.
[02:26:04.730 --> 02:26:06.131]  Well, it's not, I'll have this all in your office.
[02:26:06.131 --> 02:26:07.852]  Here, we'll do it down the street at this warehouse.
[02:26:07.852 --> 02:26:07.952]  Yeah.
[02:26:07.952 --> 02:26:11.515]  You know, where I talk to Jesse with a different backdrop, but it's really me talking to Jesse.
[02:26:11.515 --> 02:26:12.295]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:26:12.295 --> 02:26:13.436]  I mean, it's all, it's real.
[02:26:13.436 --> 02:26:14.237]  That stuff all happened.
[02:26:14.597 --> 02:26:19.300]  And they must have a hell of a budget, because everybody's flying all over the world on different planes.
[02:26:19.300 --> 02:26:22.603]  They seem to be doing very well for a group.
[02:26:22.603 --> 02:26:23.323]  I like it, though.
[02:26:23.323 --> 02:26:24.664]  I'm going to continue watching, for sure.
[02:26:24.664 --> 02:26:28.387]  Well, Dean, I'm going to go to Bob Chapman, but it was really wonderful having you.
[02:26:28.387 --> 02:26:32.049]  And I'm going to come out during a break and ran out this 1984 quote to you.
[02:26:32.049 --> 02:26:32.830]  Thank you so much.
[02:26:32.830 --> 02:26:35.432]  And we can talk with a few of those other questions during the breaks.
[02:26:35.432 --> 02:26:39.835]  And I look forward to seeing your film coming out next fall, and it's going to be called The Truth Is Out There.
[02:26:39.835 --> 02:26:40.715]  That's right.
[02:26:40.715 --> 02:26:41.296]  Thanks so much, Alex.
[02:26:41.296 --> 02:26:42.036]  Dean, great seeing you.
[02:26:42.036 --> 02:26:42.537]  You bet, man.
[02:26:42.537 --> 02:26:42.837]  Take care.
[02:26:43.297 --> 02:26:44.038]  Good seeing you, man.
[02:26:44.038 --> 02:26:44.740]  What a great guy.
[02:26:44.740 --> 02:26:46.964]  Are you going to be around this evening?
[02:26:46.964 --> 02:26:47.965]  Uh, yeah, actually I am.
[02:26:47.965 --> 02:26:48.787]  My son's here today.
[02:26:48.787 --> 02:26:49.869]  I'm taking him to get him a new bike.
[02:26:49.869 --> 02:26:51.091]  He's got a bigger bicycle.
[02:26:52.051 --> 02:26:55.713]  But maybe if you're around this evening, we can actually go out and get a bite to eat or something.
[02:26:55.713 --> 02:26:56.173]  Something.
[02:26:56.173 --> 02:26:56.794]  That'd be cool.
[02:26:56.794 --> 02:27:00.576]  I got a couple things to do, but I... Well, that's fine.
[02:27:00.576 --> 02:27:01.376]  Are you here tomorrow?
[02:27:01.376 --> 02:27:02.277]  I'm here tomorrow as well.
[02:27:02.277 --> 02:27:03.077]  Well, we'll see what happens.
[02:27:03.077 --> 02:27:03.697]  Okay, man.
[02:27:03.697 --> 02:27:04.278]  See you, bro.
[02:27:04.278 --> 02:27:04.638]  Take care.
[02:27:04.638 --> 02:27:05.398]  See you out there.
[02:27:05.398 --> 02:27:08.000]  Okay, Bob Chapman, I apologize.
[02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:09.821]  I know you're a busy fellow doing research.
[02:27:09.821 --> 02:27:11.562]  You didn't mind sitting there for 15 minutes.
[02:27:11.562 --> 02:27:13.183]  Good to have Bob Chapman with us right now.
[02:27:13.183 --> 02:27:16.064]  Bob, what's going on in the world?
[02:27:16.064 --> 02:27:18.726]  Well, our president today addressed the
[02:27:19.654 --> 02:27:26.260]  Republican Retreat, as it's called, and the results were that the Republicans weren't all that happy about what he had to say.
[02:27:26.260 --> 02:27:40.934]  And again, I think, like he did the other night, in a State of the Union address, one purely political, with a look toward, a mind toward, next November.
[02:27:40.934 --> 02:27:43.437]  And I think that's a mistake for him.
[02:27:44.618 --> 02:27:50.684]  I think he would have been better off in both instances, waltzing down the middle and trying to be a populist.
[02:27:50.684 --> 02:28:08.062]  But they must have some fierce hold on him, and he's still striking out for his programs, which I think are doomed, with the exception of the increase in short-term, I will call it, debt, which they rammed through, I think it was yesterday.
[02:28:08.971 --> 02:28:15.632]  I increased it from like 12.1 to 14.5 trillion or something like that.
[02:28:15.632 --> 02:28:21.053]  And that's another $25,000 a head for Americans to pay back.
[02:28:21.053 --> 02:28:37.677]  But I think that a lot of what went on today had to do with the ability of Congress to pass some measures which would increase employment.
[02:28:37.677 --> 02:28:38.637]  And he talked about
[02:28:39.860 --> 02:28:48.664]  Uh, the credits to be given to business for hiring people and that sort of thing, which he was forced to do.
[02:28:48.664 --> 02:28:52.526]  And he wants to make it look like it's a Democrat program.
[02:28:52.526 --> 02:28:56.168]  Again, politics as opposed to helping the people.
[02:28:56.168 --> 02:29:04.032]  Uh, he intends to help the people, but politics come first, which they shouldn't.
[02:29:04.032 --> 02:29:06.893]  And, uh, and so the reason he did that,
[02:29:07.834 --> 02:29:13.380]  Is that both parties have plans which are relatively similar.
[02:29:13.380 --> 02:29:17.704]  And so he wants to put the stamp of the Democratic Party on it.
[02:29:17.704 --> 02:29:19.706]  And that's, I think, what it was really all about.
[02:29:21.121 --> 02:29:21.902]  Absolutely.
[02:29:21.902 --> 02:29:26.805]  When we come back, I want to really try to give you the floor with just simple questions on the economy.
[02:29:26.805 --> 02:29:30.608]  Soros is saying he wants to kill gold, saying it's a bubble.
[02:29:30.608 --> 02:29:32.389]  Your take on that?
[02:29:32.389 --> 02:29:40.415]  The fact that they reconfirmed Bernanke, but that Geithner's on the verge of being indicted and being told to step down?
[02:29:40.415 --> 02:29:45.619]  That is coming up as well with Bob Chapman, TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[02:29:45.619 --> 02:29:50.283]  I'm Alex Jones, PrisonPlanet.tv, JonesReport.com, and InfoWars.com.
[02:29:51.448 --> 02:29:55.377]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.377 --> 02:29:58.063]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.643 --> 02:30:05.206]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:30:05.206 --> 02:30:06.106]  Number one.
[02:30:06.106 --> 02:30:09.529]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:30:09.529 --> 02:30:10.389]  Number two.
[02:30:10.389 --> 02:30:15.292]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:30:15.292 --> 02:30:16.033]  It's true.
[02:30:16.033 --> 02:30:20.896]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:30:20.896 --> 02:30:21.356]  Number three.
[02:30:21.716 --> 02:30:25.299]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:30:25.299 --> 02:30:30.023]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:30:30.023 --> 02:30:32.785]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:30:32.785 --> 02:30:37.249]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:30:37.249 --> 02:30:41.413]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:30:41.413 --> 02:30:46.157]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:30:46.457 --> 02:30:50.622]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:30:50.622 --> 02:30:52.405]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:30:52.405 --> 02:30:54.668]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:30:54.668 --> 02:30:57.011]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:31:01.069 --> 02:31:04.072]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:31:04.072 --> 02:31:09.417]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:31:09.417 --> 02:31:11.459]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:31:11.459 --> 02:31:16.464]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:31:16.464 --> 02:31:17.385]  How much do you want?
[02:31:17.645 --> 02:31:18.766]  When do you want it?
[02:31:18.766 --> 02:31:20.647]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:31:20.647 --> 02:31:21.727]  When will you need it?
[02:31:21.727 --> 02:31:23.928]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:31:23.928 --> 02:31:25.269]  Will there be any food?
[02:31:25.269 --> 02:31:26.790]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:31:26.790 --> 02:31:32.053]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:31:32.053 --> 02:31:35.635]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:31:35.635 --> 02:31:39.117]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:31:39.457 --> 02:31:40.678]  How much will you need?
[02:31:40.678 --> 02:31:41.578]  We don't know.
[02:31:41.578 --> 02:31:42.678]  How much do you want?
[02:31:42.678 --> 02:31:43.619]  All you can get.
[02:31:43.619 --> 02:31:44.719]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:31:44.719 --> 02:31:47.761]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:31:47.761 --> 02:31:49.541]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:31:49.541 --> 02:31:50.462]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:32:00.026 --> 02:32:04.130]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[02:32:04.130 --> 02:32:07.012]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[02:32:07.012 --> 02:32:09.094]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[02:32:09.094 --> 02:32:11.336]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[02:32:11.336 --> 02:32:12.998]  And it's available right now to you.
[02:32:12.998 --> 02:32:17.482]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[02:32:17.482 --> 02:32:19.744]  Clean, great-tasting water without all the pollutants.

[02:32:26.045 --> 02:32:30.826]  Their best seller, the Ecola Blue 28, produces up to 7 gallons of water every day.
[02:32:30.826 --> 02:32:33.647]  The Ecola Blue 28 is easy to use and economical.
[02:32:33.647 --> 02:32:36.387]  Generate your own pure water from the humidity in the air.
[02:32:36.387 --> 02:32:43.529]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.

[02:32:47.833 --> 02:32:49.755]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[02:33:16.823 --> 02:33:22.047]  Bob Shatman is our guest, as he is every Friday in the third hour.
[02:33:22.047 --> 02:33:24.288]  Bob, again, thank you for joining us.
[02:33:24.288 --> 02:33:25.929]  Obama is in free fall.
[02:33:25.929 --> 02:33:32.413]  Are you concerned about the danger of him now staging terror attacks or a new war to try to get his approval ratings up?
[02:33:32.413 --> 02:33:36.776]  I mean, that's what they always go to in their playbook.
[02:33:36.776 --> 02:33:42.380]  Under normal circumstances, I'd say yes, but I think in his case, no.
[02:33:42.380 --> 02:33:45.122]  And the reason why, to me, is that
[02:33:46.370 --> 02:33:53.555]  They have to have better reasons than that to do a false flag operation or a 9-11 or something like that.
[02:33:53.555 --> 02:33:56.277]  These people are so easily replaceable.
[02:33:56.277 --> 02:34:11.108]  You know, it's like we saw Geithner arrogantly, and it so much fits the personality and the same kind of experience that you had when you talked to Mr. Rothschild.
[02:34:11.884 --> 02:34:13.685]  They think they're above it all.
[02:34:13.685 --> 02:34:17.346]  They're in a plane that we cannot approach.
[02:34:17.346 --> 02:34:22.107]  We're just a bunch of animals upon Earth for them to herd around.
[02:34:22.107 --> 02:34:33.950]  And, you know, you get this dreadful example of what they shouldn't be doing in front of the public, but they do it anyway.
[02:34:33.950 --> 02:34:37.311]  And I guess they just can't help themselves.
[02:34:38.206 --> 02:34:42.488]  Like Kramer saying that there's an Illuminati.
[02:34:42.488 --> 02:34:44.229]  Did you see that tape?
[02:34:44.229 --> 02:34:45.970]  Absolutely!
[02:34:45.970 --> 02:34:47.271]  Unbelievable!
[02:34:47.271 --> 02:34:49.432]  I mean, did he mess up?
[02:34:49.432 --> 02:35:00.898]  But anyway, what we're looking at is a president that can be replaced in a light second.
[02:35:00.898 --> 02:35:03.540]  And I just don't feel that
[02:35:04.173 --> 02:35:09.539]  His waning popularity would bring that about.
[02:35:09.539 --> 02:35:16.528]  There have to be more serious plans to do things than that, because they can replace these guys in five seconds.
[02:35:16.528 --> 02:35:20.312]  Just like the fight over Bernanke, which was passed.
[02:35:20.312 --> 02:35:22.695]  He's going to continue to be the Chairman of the Federal Reserve.
[02:35:23.288 --> 02:35:33.192]  If it wasn't him, it'd be some other goat that they would put in his place and say, look, this is what you do, and it will arrange for you to live happily ever after.
[02:35:33.192 --> 02:35:37.334]  And it's the same thing with the President of the United States.
[02:35:37.334 --> 02:35:49.160]  You know, if it isn't working well, well, all of a sudden what'll happen is that they'll say, look, you tried and it didn't work, and so we're gonna find out that you're not an American citizen.
[02:35:49.160 --> 02:35:49.740]  Much simpler.
[02:35:52.592 --> 02:35:54.694]  Absolutely.
[02:35:54.694 --> 02:35:56.896]  What do you see unfolding with the banks?
[02:35:56.896 --> 02:36:16.112]  As the economy gets worse and worse, as the looting expands, as the shops and factories close, as the people discover the Federal Reserve is private, which they've now done, and that they are doing this by design, and as the calls for Geithner to be indicted for Bankstergate intensify, where do you see this going?
[02:36:19.859 --> 02:36:26.721]  Uh, first of all, I've not known of any alumnus who's ever gone to jail.
[02:36:26.721 --> 02:36:30.722]  I can't remember in the last 50 years one that did.
[02:36:30.722 --> 02:36:37.564]  If anything, what they do is they say, yeah, he's guilty, but we're going to find him.
[02:36:38.386 --> 02:36:47.611]  And that'll be the end of it, and then they'll put him on the staff of some foundation, or several boards of directors, that sort of thing.
[02:36:47.611 --> 02:36:48.832]  That's how they get away with that.
[02:36:48.832 --> 02:36:54.695]  And they have to do that, because if any of their crooks ever go to prison, that sets the precedent that other crooks can go to prison.
[02:36:54.695 --> 02:37:07.162]  That's like in the old days in Europe, if a king was overthrown, the other king would just have him exiled, or Napoleon would be exiled to a different island, because they don't want to set the precedent to ever
[02:37:07.842 --> 02:37:10.983]  Taking down a kingpin.
[02:37:10.983 --> 02:37:13.343]  Especially one of their own.
[02:37:13.343 --> 02:37:19.964]  And that's very important because their pecking order is important to them.
[02:37:19.964 --> 02:37:30.366]  They cover for each other and even though sometimes there are great odds with one another, the conspiracy itself is foremost and first.
[02:37:30.366 --> 02:37:36.347]  The generation of power from one generation to another.
[02:37:37.136 --> 02:37:39.919]  And so they'd only let each other down.
[02:37:39.919 --> 02:37:42.361]  And if they do, it's a mistake.
[02:37:42.361 --> 02:37:50.209]  I mean, they do argue and fight among each other, verbally, about what should be done.
[02:37:50.209 --> 02:37:58.878]  And to people like Geithner and Rothschild keeping their mouth shut, and Kramer keeping his mouth shut too, that would be a miracle.
[02:38:01.011 --> 02:38:08.218]  But, you know, if you don't think all the time about what you're saying, you can really get yourself in trouble.
[02:38:08.218 --> 02:38:08.719]  Right, Alex?
[02:38:11.784 --> 02:38:17.048]  Bob, so how do you see this unfolding then with the banks and the economy?
[02:38:17.048 --> 02:38:18.929]  And I don't know if you saw the Soros clip.
[02:38:18.929 --> 02:38:19.950]  It's up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:38:19.950 --> 02:38:24.233]  We're going to play it coming out of the next break so you can comment on it further.
[02:38:24.233 --> 02:38:27.995]  He's really bad-mouthing gold right now, saying it's the biggest bubble.
[02:38:27.995 --> 02:38:35.501]  When the currencies are all being simultaneously devalued, they're pumping trillions out into the economy to buy up assets.
[02:38:36.401 --> 02:38:41.724]  I mean, gold is only going up because they're devaluing currency, so gold costs more.
[02:38:41.724 --> 02:38:46.507]  Isn't the currency and derivatives the ultimate bubble?
[02:38:46.507 --> 02:38:48.128]  They certainly are.
[02:38:48.128 --> 02:38:51.210]  And you gotta look at George's background.
[02:38:51.210 --> 02:38:55.192]  Convicted of stock fraud in France, he appealed and lost.
[02:38:55.192 --> 02:39:00.855]  Convicted of stock fraud in Hungary not too long ago, no appeal yet.
[02:39:01.728 --> 02:39:03.569]  Uh, the guy is an arch criminal.
[02:39:03.569 --> 02:39:06.650]  He's a front man for the Illuminati.
[02:39:06.650 --> 02:39:08.731]  And they say, look, this is what we're going to do.
[02:39:08.731 --> 02:39:11.892]  So you go out and do this, this, this, this, and this.
[02:39:11.892 --> 02:39:14.994]  And what will happen is you'll make about $20 billion.
[02:39:14.994 --> 02:39:21.577]  And then you will take that money, and this is where you'll put it, and this is what you'll do with it.
[02:39:21.577 --> 02:39:22.477]  And that's how it works.
[02:39:23.044 --> 02:39:34.416]  And when you die, all of the money that you've accumulated, let's say it's a hundred billion dollars, that will go to these different groups and foundations which we control.
[02:39:34.416 --> 02:39:39.422]  But George is doing this because he's being told to do it.
[02:39:39.422 --> 02:39:41.724]  Well, it's like that clip from...
[02:39:45.171 --> 02:39:53.833]  It's like that clip from him a few months ago, where he said, of course I know where the dollar will be going, but I will not, of course, tell you.
[02:39:53.833 --> 02:40:01.935]  I mean, just a completely arrogant, criminal piece of garbage.
[02:40:01.935 --> 02:40:03.336]  Now, here's a separate question.
[02:40:03.336 --> 02:40:04.216]  I'm going to go back to gold.
[02:40:04.216 --> 02:40:11.498]  Incidentally, that's the profile again, Alex, of the three people we just talked about.
[02:40:11.498 --> 02:40:11.918]  Arrogance.
[02:40:13.288 --> 02:40:16.349]  Above all, above everyone.
[02:40:16.349 --> 02:40:19.189]  It's a hallmark with these people nowadays.
[02:40:19.189 --> 02:40:26.131]  They never acted that way in the 60s and 70s and 80s and 90s, but they do now.
[02:40:26.131 --> 02:40:26.471]  Why?
[02:40:26.471 --> 02:40:27.971]  I mean, everybody's waking up to them.
[02:40:27.971 --> 02:40:30.192]  Why are they so arrogant now?
[02:40:30.192 --> 02:40:34.833]  Well, I'm just telling you, you're not going to take us down, and I get news of them, they're going to get taken down.
[02:40:34.833 --> 02:40:38.914]  Oh, do you think the arrogance is a front?
[02:40:38.914 --> 02:40:39.694]  Absolutely.
[02:40:40.658 --> 02:40:43.401]  It's a psychological defense for a sociopath.
[02:40:43.401 --> 02:40:47.005]  I mean, did you see Geithner?
[02:40:47.005 --> 02:40:50.789]  Like, he treated those people like they were animals.
[02:40:50.789 --> 02:40:52.211]  He looked like a cornered devil.
[02:40:52.211 --> 02:40:53.672]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:40:53.672 --> 02:40:57.096]  Yes, and did you see our friend Mr. Paulson?
[02:40:57.096 --> 02:40:59.298]  Was terrified.
[02:40:59.298 --> 02:41:02.442]  He was terrified, and that's the second time I've seen that.
[02:41:04.236 --> 02:41:07.579]  Yeah, he's losing it.
[02:41:07.579 --> 02:41:14.364]  He reportedly collapsed once after one of these and he is now shaking and can't talk.
[02:41:14.364 --> 02:41:16.426]  He didn't used to be like that.
[02:41:16.426 --> 02:41:17.266]  That's right.
[02:41:17.266 --> 02:41:18.988]  This is an evolutionary process.
[02:41:18.988 --> 02:41:33.219]  He got himself in with the Illuminati and he was boosted to all these positions because he was one of their donkeys and did what he was told and now after he's made, I don't know, hundreds of millions of dollars, he's being
[02:41:34.190 --> 02:41:39.986]  Having opposition bring him on the carpet and he can't handle it.
[02:41:39.986 --> 02:41:42.272]  There's gonna be a lot of that.
[02:41:42.935 --> 02:41:50.842]  Bob, you remember 25 years ago when Volcker would be brought up, or 15 years ago, 10 years ago when Greenspan.
[02:41:50.842 --> 02:41:52.804]  I mean, they acted like the Queen of England was there.
[02:41:52.804 --> 02:41:58.869]  Everyone was just shaking, and the congressmen were just, oh, oh, sir, oh!
[02:41:58.869 --> 02:42:02.272]  Now they treat them with arrogance and contempt like they should be.
[02:42:02.272 --> 02:42:06.856]  Their shield of infallibility has dropped.
[02:42:06.856 --> 02:42:07.297]  It's gone.
[02:42:08.266 --> 02:42:11.088]  Uh, they haven't got the Volke yet, but they sure are getting the brain span.
[02:42:11.088 --> 02:42:15.911]  There's books coming out on it, and, uh, uh, what a dreadful character he is.
[02:42:15.911 --> 02:42:19.274]  And, uh, he, you know, he sold out what was right.
[02:42:19.274 --> 02:42:21.175]  I mean, that's really the bottom line.
[02:42:21.175 --> 02:42:22.036]  Well, he was one of us.
[02:42:22.036 --> 02:42:23.497]  He screwed his fellow man.
[02:42:23.497 --> 02:42:24.878]  He was one of us at a time.
[02:42:24.878 --> 02:42:26.739]  I mean, he was writing books about the New World Order.
[02:42:26.739 --> 02:42:32.603]  Everything that's going on, and that makes it ten times worse.
[02:42:32.603 --> 02:42:34.745]  You know, he is one of the few who was actually
[02:42:35.902 --> 02:42:42.574]  You read his writings in the 60s and 70s, he was one of us.
[02:42:42.574 --> 02:42:44.397]  They literally turned him to the dark side.
[02:42:47.159 --> 02:42:49.741]  He couldn't make it as an economist.
[02:42:49.741 --> 02:42:57.445]  He had one client left when he joined the Federal Reserve, and they propelled him up where they said, let's make a deal.
[02:42:57.445 --> 02:42:58.926]  You do this, this, and this.
[02:42:58.926 --> 02:43:01.328]  We'll give you that, that, and that.
[02:43:01.328 --> 02:43:02.388]  And he went for it.
[02:43:02.388 --> 02:43:08.772]  He sold out his fellow conservatives, we'll call them.
[02:43:08.772 --> 02:43:11.294]  Unbelievable.
[02:43:11.294 --> 02:43:15.016]  And of course, Volcker has always been one tough cookie.
[02:43:15.811 --> 02:43:24.437]  And he would never get in like Paulson and quiver under cross-examination, we'll call it.
[02:43:24.437 --> 02:43:32.543]  And he would never be arrogant like we just saw Geithner or Rothschild.
[02:43:32.543 --> 02:43:33.964]  He's too smart for that.
[02:43:33.964 --> 02:43:39.068]  Well, Geithner literally looked like he was going insane.
[02:43:39.068 --> 02:43:40.649]  I mean, he looked... I mean, he was...
[02:43:42.699 --> 02:43:47.041]  I mean, he was... I mean, just the faces he was making.
[02:43:47.041 --> 02:43:52.283]  Well, just ask any psychiatrist and he'll tell you, Alex, you're absolutely right.
[02:43:52.283 --> 02:43:56.085]  It's the reaction of a cornered sociopath.
[02:43:56.085 --> 02:43:58.406]  And that's what they all are.
[02:43:58.406 --> 02:44:05.669]  I mean, there's other words, and some of them are absolutely insane, but they happen to be in control, and we've got to take them down.
[02:44:05.669 --> 02:44:09.351]  And that's what this program's all about, and all the programs like it, and all the internet.
[02:44:09.975 --> 02:44:17.579]  Are we gonna make their lives absolutely miserable until they finally are defeated or they give up one or the other?
[02:44:17.579 --> 02:44:20.120]  Meanwhile, they just want to get us in fighting with each other.
[02:44:20.120 --> 02:44:21.801]  We can't let them do that.
[02:44:21.801 --> 02:44:23.342]  That's right.
[02:44:23.342 --> 02:44:25.803]  Absolutely.
[02:44:25.803 --> 02:44:30.666]  And so Mr. Soros is just doing what he's being told to do.
[02:44:30.666 --> 02:44:32.647]  I mean, you gotta look at his background.
[02:44:32.647 --> 02:44:36.429]  I mean, he's a Jewish man who helped the Nazis
[02:44:37.293 --> 02:44:38.854]  Kill his own people!
[02:44:38.854 --> 02:44:43.717]  I mean, what kind of a human being is that?
[02:44:43.717 --> 02:44:47.800]  That is awful!
[02:44:47.800 --> 02:44:49.921]  Well, it's the same thing with Madeleine Albright's dad.
[02:44:49.921 --> 02:44:53.103]  Mm-hmm.
[02:44:53.103 --> 02:44:54.304]  I mean, it just never ends.
[02:44:54.304 --> 02:45:03.830]  When he discovered she was Jewish, maybe a year or two before she left the general scene, so to speak,
[02:45:05.220 --> 02:45:09.463]  And all her life she didn't know, and of course she did.
[02:45:09.463 --> 02:45:22.132]  Now, expanding on the gold situation, obviously if currencies are continuing to devalue, gold is going to go up, and Soros is always trying to manipulate the markets.
[02:45:22.132 --> 02:45:23.773]  What does that mean to you?
[02:45:23.773 --> 02:45:28.616]  Does that mean they're having trouble suppressing it, and he's trying to further keep it down?
[02:45:28.616 --> 02:45:29.657]  Yes, it does.
[02:45:29.657 --> 02:45:34.160]  And I'll tell you, today I wrote a piece that's going to be in tomorrow's forecaster,
[02:45:35.095 --> 02:45:53.267]  And it's about the fact, last February, the Fed Reserve made a deal with five of the six central banks that, or currencies that they have, that are in the USDX, the U.S.
[02:45:53.267 --> 02:45:54.948]  dollar index.
[02:45:54.948 --> 02:46:02.532]  And that was Japan, Canada, Switzerland, the European Central Bank, and
[02:46:04.147 --> 02:46:05.408]  Who did I miss?
[02:46:05.408 --> 02:46:08.309]  Well, the one I left out was Sweden.
[02:46:08.309 --> 02:46:10.731]  And so anyway, they swap $500 billion.
[02:46:10.731 --> 02:46:23.598]  And what they do is they give these nations, five of them, $500 billion or $100 billion each, which the Fed makes up out of thin air.
[02:46:23.598 --> 02:46:30.122]  And in turn from that, they get the foreign currencies of those nations.
[02:46:30.122 --> 02:46:31.743]  And you say to yourself, why would they do that?
[02:46:33.075 --> 02:46:45.638]  They do that to support the dollar, because when the dollar gets weak on the USDX, they go in and sell those currencies into the market, making the dollar go up.
[02:46:45.638 --> 02:46:48.939]  I found out today that it wasn't $500 billion.
[02:46:48.939 --> 02:46:51.720]  The rumor is it's $2 trillion.
[02:46:51.720 --> 02:46:58.842]  Now, they're going to unravel that swamp, which means that
[02:47:01.226 --> 02:47:10.549]  The manipulation that they were able to affect to keep the dollar higher isn't going to work anymore.
[02:47:10.549 --> 02:47:20.032]  Second of all, the recipients of the dollars, they took those dollars and they bought treasuries at auction or in the market.
[02:47:20.032 --> 02:47:22.653]  That's not going to happen anymore.
[02:47:22.653 --> 02:47:30.576]  Now, whether they'll try to unravel by buying back the foreign currencies that they sold
[02:47:32.177 --> 02:47:41.323]  Or, by the other central banks buying back the dollars that they sold, I don't know that they'll do that, and I don't think that they will.
[02:47:41.323 --> 02:47:50.908]  They will hold it on the books and say, uh, this is an asset, and this is a deficit, and they offset each other.
[02:47:50.908 --> 02:47:51.909]  That's what they'll do.
[02:47:51.909 --> 02:47:58.753]  But the point is, that the manipulation of dollars is going to get far, far more difficult.
[02:47:58.753 --> 02:48:00.434]  And the dollar purchases,
[02:48:01.594 --> 02:48:02.415]  Of U.S.
[02:48:02.415 --> 02:48:06.637]  Treasuries is going to diminuate as well.
[02:48:06.637 --> 02:48:09.619]  So they're going to have some real problems.
[02:48:09.619 --> 02:48:18.025]  Another thing that's akin to that, Alex, is that at its height about a year and a half ago, the U.S.
[02:48:18.025 --> 02:48:23.669]  was increasing money and credit, which used to be called M3, by about 17.5%.
[02:48:23.669 --> 02:48:26.130]  Now it's about 4%.
[02:48:26.130 --> 02:48:28.492]  So they've come down in the creation of money and credit.
[02:48:29.830 --> 02:48:40.955]  The European Central Bank went from 12.8%, listen to this, to minus 0.02% for two months in a row.
[02:48:40.955 --> 02:48:49.779]  Now, what they've done here is pulled the excess money and credit out of the world market, essentially.
[02:48:49.779 --> 02:48:54.041]  In order to keep the system going, they have to have more money and credit.
[02:48:56.112 --> 02:49:00.216]  Now, that means that they can't raise interest rates early or easily.
[02:49:00.216 --> 02:49:14.248]  And it also means that the $12.7 trillion that they, from the Fed Reserve and the Treasury Department, posited into the economy cannot be pulled out.
[02:49:14.248 --> 02:49:17.991]  And they're going to have to find a way not to pull more out.
[02:49:18.712 --> 02:49:20.874]  But to add some in before the whole thing collapses.
[02:49:38.015 --> 02:49:41.117]  Fake numbers on production.
[02:49:41.117 --> 02:49:44.718]  Manufacturing increases and then downscaled them six months later.
[02:49:44.718 --> 02:49:47.540]  They put out new fake manufacturing with 5.2 today.
[02:49:50.279 --> 02:49:51.379]  And clearly that's fake.
[02:49:51.379 --> 02:49:53.520]  They say we've got 10% unemployment when it's over 22.
[02:49:53.520 --> 02:49:56.081]  We're going to go to break, Bob.
[02:49:56.081 --> 02:49:59.202]  I'm going to keep you five minutes into the next hour if we can so we have time.
[02:49:59.202 --> 02:50:07.245]  I want to get into how George Soros and others, when we come out of break, are saying they're going to continue with SDRs to fund the new cap and trade system.
[02:50:07.245 --> 02:50:10.506]  So the central banks will take tax money and give it to their own
[02:50:11.426 --> 02:50:11.506]  Yes.
[02:50:26.913 --> 02:50:27.694]  Uh, coming up.
[02:50:27.694 --> 02:50:29.016]  They're taking over the cities.
[02:50:29.016 --> 02:50:32.941]  The UN is here, running the operation in Austin.
[02:50:32.941 --> 02:50:38.207]  So we're gonna go to break, come back with about a minute and a half of Soros on this, and then get Bob Chapman's take.
[02:50:38.207 --> 02:50:41.010]  His website's TheInternationalForecaster.com.

[02:52:21.221 --> 02:52:26.423]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:52:26.423 --> 02:52:36.405]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.

[02:52:38.866 --> 02:52:40.467]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:52:40.467 --> 02:52:42.928]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:52:42.928 --> 02:52:45.049]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[02:52:45.049 --> 02:52:50.191]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[02:53:58.674 --> 02:54:00.795]  The smoking gun heard round the world.
[02:54:03.263 --> 02:54:04.163]  Okay.
[02:54:04.163 --> 02:54:04.884]  Let me switch gears.
[02:54:04.884 --> 02:54:09.466]  In Copenhagen, you talked about your proposal as a way to fund CO2 cuts.
[02:54:09.466 --> 02:54:14.948]  Talk to us a little about that and how rich nations might tap into that special currency.
[02:54:14.948 --> 02:54:21.291]  Well, Copenhagen, let's face it, was a bust.
[02:54:21.291 --> 02:54:23.192]  It was a disappointment.
[02:54:23.192 --> 02:54:32.116]  But I think that the global warming or the climate change doesn't go away and we have to deal with it.
[02:54:33.036 --> 02:54:47.602]  And it's of course very difficult now with each country under pressure at home to make any large grants or financing to the less developed world.
[02:54:47.602 --> 02:54:49.243]  So I put forward a plan.
[02:54:50.444 --> 02:55:02.362]  That they can use the special drawing rights they received in the last distribution, for which they have no use, because their credit is good enough, to lend it back to the IMF.
[02:55:04.305 --> 02:55:16.676]  And then the IMF can use it to set up a green fund that would finance investments for clean energy and infrastructure, agriculture and so on.
[02:55:16.676 --> 02:55:22.801]  And then the IMF would be responsible for paying the interest.
[02:55:22.801 --> 02:55:28.746]  And that could be then financed either by the developed world
[02:55:29.787 --> 02:55:45.084]  Picking up that cost, which is actually tiny, through their overseas development assistance programs, or they could authorize the IMF to use its gold reserves
[02:55:46.326 --> 02:55:48.188]  to pay the interest.
[02:55:48.188 --> 02:56:02.165]  And the amounts involved are insignificant, and as long as the countries that lend it to the IMF have the IMF as the counterparty, there is no credit risk.
[02:56:07.503 --> 02:56:19.089]  Well, George Soros goes on and on in the interview, how they're going to continue getting our property, they're going to continue coming after our land, they're going to continue to try to set up a global dictatorship that decides who can have a business, who can't.
[02:56:19.089 --> 02:56:21.591]  And Austin is the crown jewel.
[02:56:21.591 --> 02:56:25.353]  They're hiring former Pentagon officials, black ops, it's in the paper.
[02:56:25.353 --> 02:56:30.516]  Oh, the black ops commander, CIA black ops and psych warfare is running the program.
[02:56:30.516 --> 02:56:34.718]  I mean, hellish inspectors coming into our houses, brainwashing our kids.
[02:56:34.718 --> 02:56:36.139]  They mean business, Bob Chapman.
[02:56:37.139 --> 02:56:44.043]  They certainly do, and they've never meant anything but business, and they're not going to give up easy.
[02:56:44.043 --> 02:56:59.532]  And as you can see, they're trying to bypass legislation through various means to implement this global warming climate change taxation model.
[02:56:59.532 --> 02:57:02.394]  And they're going to continue to do it as long as we let them.
[02:57:03.717 --> 02:57:10.701]  Now, Bob, when we went to break, you were starting to get a little bit into how much trouble they're in and what's going to happen with the economy.
[02:57:10.701 --> 02:57:14.524]  I mean, they wanted to implode it, to consolidate it.
[02:57:14.524 --> 02:57:15.964]  That's in the Goldman Sachs documents.
[02:57:15.964 --> 02:57:18.466]  But you're saying this has gotten out of hand for them.
[02:57:18.466 --> 02:57:21.708]  The greediness is, they've kind of over-gorged themselves on our blood.
[02:57:21.708 --> 02:57:24.770]  I think that's true.
[02:57:24.770 --> 02:57:29.933]  And I also, I don't know what they're going to do next.
[02:57:29.933 --> 02:57:31.694]  They're either ready to pull the plug,
[02:57:32.609 --> 02:57:35.570]  Or they're going to have to re-inflate again.
[02:57:35.570 --> 02:57:39.511]  And I don't know which, and I don't think anybody else does for that matter.
[02:57:39.511 --> 02:57:41.471]  All we can do is guess.
[02:57:41.471 --> 02:57:50.454]  But this is the smallest amount of money and credit that I've seen in a long, long time by a multiplicity of countries.
[02:57:51.292 --> 02:57:54.334]  So this is centrally planned, this is not coincidence.
[02:57:54.334 --> 02:58:15.431]  It's just like the comment and hearing that's going on in... created by the administration to see what the public reaction is going to be to government issuing annuities for your retirement plans.
[02:58:16.397 --> 02:58:22.121]  That's right, they're saying they're going to take your 401k or your pension.
[02:58:22.121 --> 02:58:23.442]  This is mainstream news.
[02:58:23.442 --> 02:58:25.664]  I told you four years ago they were going to do it.
[02:58:25.664 --> 02:58:28.707]  And they're going to tax it and manage it for you, Bob.
[02:58:28.707 --> 02:58:31.709]  You're not going to be allowed to have your own bank account.
[02:58:31.709 --> 02:58:38.414]  They're now saying, this is again federal regulation, they're saying that money markets aren't insured.
[02:58:38.414 --> 02:58:39.074]  Stay there, Bob.
[02:58:39.074 --> 02:58:46.180]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[02:58:50.803 --> 02:58:55.344]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:58:55.344 --> 02:58:56.264]  Number one.
[02:58:56.264 --> 02:58:59.685]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:58:59.685 --> 02:59:00.546]  Number two.
[02:59:00.546 --> 02:59:05.427]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:59:05.427 --> 02:59:06.187]  It's true.
[02:59:06.187 --> 02:59:11.049]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:59:11.049 --> 02:59:11.509]  Number three.
[02:59:11.869 --> 02:59:15.452]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:59:15.452 --> 02:59:20.176]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:59:20.176 --> 02:59:22.938]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:59:22.938 --> 02:59:27.402]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:59:27.402 --> 02:59:31.546]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:59:31.546 --> 02:59:36.310]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:59:36.590 --> 02:59:40.753]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:59:40.753 --> 02:59:42.555]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:59:42.555 --> 02:59:44.816]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:59:44.816 --> 02:59:47.158]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[03:00:07.813 --> 03:00:11.997]  There is so much I want to talk to Bob Chatman about, but we are out of time.
[03:00:11.997 --> 03:00:17.302]  We've got Dr. Tim Ball, climatologist, coming up, but we know Paulson.
[03:00:18.962 --> 03:00:23.425]  In a coordinated effort with the European Central Banks, plunge the housing market.
[03:00:23.425 --> 03:00:26.847]  They started using their media to badmouth it in 2007.
[03:00:26.847 --> 03:00:30.610]  Now they blame the Russians for the economic crisis of 2008.
[03:00:30.610 --> 03:00:38.275]  He says a secret conspiracy when the Russian market went down by what, over 60% with no evidence.
[03:00:38.275 --> 03:00:41.017]  I mean, they're really getting desperate now in testimony, Bob Chapman.
[03:00:42.228 --> 03:00:43.810]  Oh, they certainly are.
[03:00:43.810 --> 03:00:53.683]  And I noticed the President came out and said, we're not putting those missiles and radar stations 35 miles away from Kalanenburg.
[03:00:55.726 --> 03:01:03.273]  Well, the Russian city that's nearby, and this is the exact opposite of what the previous administration said.
[03:01:03.273 --> 03:01:11.061]  They had to have the missiles on the radar because of Iran, and now the United States government is admitting that that wasn't the case.
[03:01:11.061 --> 03:01:15.946]  Our previous president lied, and it's really because we don't trust the Russians.
[03:01:18.069 --> 03:01:31.676]  Well, I mean, what's incredible about this is, on record, the big banks, the central banks, the kingpin banks, not your Mayberry Bank folks, but the big global banks, they engineered this whole thing on purpose in public.
[03:01:33.018 --> 03:01:39.421]  And to now have conspiracy theories about how the Russians did it is just asinine.
[03:01:39.421 --> 03:01:41.742]  They are taking over the major highways for toll roads.
[03:01:41.742 --> 03:01:43.302]  We're fighting them on that.
[03:01:43.302 --> 03:01:47.304]  They just re-change the name and say they've cancelled it and then go ahead with it.
[03:01:47.304 --> 03:01:50.205]  They say, okay, we won't put a toll road there, and then they just do it.
[03:01:51.866 --> 03:01:54.668]  I mean, how long can they get away with this seizing everything?
[03:01:54.668 --> 03:02:02.373]  It shows they're going for broke pretty much militarily to where they just keep denying, denying, denying as they keep doing it.
[03:02:02.373 --> 03:02:15.101]  And now they're coming in saying they're going to seize all our major energy locally in every major city and have environmental inspectors in our houses and 2.6 billion in Austin alone of new taxes in the next three years.
[03:02:15.101 --> 03:02:17.143]  I mean, my God, they are just going wild.
[03:02:18.962 --> 03:02:23.886]  That's right, and it's up to people at the local level to stop them.
[03:02:23.886 --> 03:02:30.130]  I mean, it's their cities, their towns, their counties, and their states that are being intruded upon.
[03:02:30.130 --> 03:02:35.134]  Their sovereignty, collectively, is being misused by these people.
[03:02:35.134 --> 03:02:37.476]  I mean, where do these people come from?
[03:02:37.476 --> 03:02:38.797]  Get out of here!
[03:02:38.797 --> 03:02:39.598]  Don't do that!
[03:02:39.598 --> 03:02:40.378]  We don't want you!
[03:02:40.378 --> 03:02:43.601]  Do you hear that in Austin?
[03:02:44.400 --> 03:02:46.841]  Well, the public thinks they're going bankrupt now.
[03:02:46.841 --> 03:02:47.401]  Just wait.
[03:02:47.401 --> 03:02:50.302]  And again, that's the plan, isn't it, Bob?
[03:02:50.302 --> 03:02:51.603]  It certainly is.
[03:02:51.603 --> 03:02:56.565]  We've got 40 states on the edge, and three of them are really in trouble.
[03:02:56.565 --> 03:03:03.147]  And of course, California is the number one victim, which has been coming for years.
[03:03:03.147 --> 03:03:04.468]  I lived there for 36 years.
[03:03:04.468 --> 03:03:08.109]  I left because they said, in 1994, they're going bankrupt.
[03:03:08.109 --> 03:03:10.110]  It's over.
[03:03:10.110 --> 03:03:13.671]  And of course, it took a little bit longer than I thought, but it's over.
[03:03:14.423 --> 03:03:15.563]  There's no way they can get out.
[03:03:15.563 --> 03:03:24.065]  They're going to have to cut pensions and salaries and have layoffs and they're going to have to get rid of their illegal aliens.
[03:03:24.065 --> 03:03:26.945]  Bob, we've only got a minute and a half left.
[03:03:26.945 --> 03:03:40.428]  When they make the federal declarations, which they've already made, that they're going to not insure money markets, which are savings accounts, and that they're going to take people's pension funds, but the government will keep it for you and give you part of it.
[03:03:40.428 --> 03:03:42.928]  I mean, do they think the public's going to put up with that?
[03:03:44.557 --> 03:03:47.781]  Well, they're bringing us closer to revolution, I'll tell you that.
[03:03:47.781 --> 03:03:56.831]  We either take over with new people in the House and the Senate, and get 1207 passed as part of the Appropriations Bill, or it's over.
[03:03:56.831 --> 03:03:58.353]  They will get it in the streets.
[03:03:58.353 --> 03:04:01.116]  And they will not survive, believe me.
[03:04:01.116 --> 03:04:02.218]  They don't stand a chance.
[03:04:02.754 --> 03:04:05.475]  And our military is not going to shoot us.
[03:04:05.475 --> 03:04:06.256]  Believe me.
[03:04:06.256 --> 03:04:14.500]  Well, that's the good news, Bob, is the elites have for the last four years all been moving their main homes to remote islands.
[03:04:14.500 --> 03:04:22.683]  And so they may just be robbing us and leaving a base here hoping they're going to win.
[03:04:22.683 --> 03:04:32.368]  Well, I'll tell you, going to a remote somewhere is not the answer because today it's so easy to track people down unless you're really an expert.
[03:04:33.090 --> 03:04:37.551]  It's not like after the Second World War and all those Nazis were hiding all over the world.
[03:04:37.551 --> 03:04:39.171]  This is a different thing.
[03:04:39.171 --> 03:04:42.252]  And they're not going to get away with it.

[03:04:46.993 --> 03:04:48.433]  Bob, always great talking to you.
[03:04:48.433 --> 03:04:49.934]  Thanks for spending time with us.
[03:04:49.934 --> 03:04:52.034]  Thank you and thanks everybody for listening.
[03:04:52.034 --> 03:04:52.854]  Bye-bye.
[03:04:52.854 --> 03:04:53.174]  Take care.
[03:04:53.174 --> 03:04:54.395]  We'll see you next Friday.
[03:04:54.395 --> 03:04:59.776]  Okay, Dr. Tim Ball coming up on all the latest on ClimateGate and the next phase.
[03:05:02.847 --> 03:05:06.808]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[03:05:06.808 --> 03:05:15.670]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[03:05:15.670 --> 03:05:20.291]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[03:05:20.291 --> 03:05:31.113]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[03:05:31.733 --> 03:05:41.262]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[03:05:41.262 --> 03:05:46.687]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[03:05:46.687 --> 03:05:54.193]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[03:05:54.193 --> 03:05:56.936]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[03:06:02.068 --> 03:06:06.072]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:06:06.072 --> 03:06:09.335]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:06:09.335 --> 03:06:14.139]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[03:06:14.139 --> 03:06:20.526]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:06:20.526 --> 03:06:22.768]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[03:06:23.288 --> 03:06:23.608]  Tim Geithner?
[03:06:23.608 --> 03:06:24.109]  Bernanke?
[03:06:24.109 --> 03:06:24.769]  They're arsonists!
[03:06:24.769 --> 03:06:26.071]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:06:26.071 --> 03:06:28.313]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:06:42.205 --> 03:06:46.587]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[03:06:46.587 --> 03:06:49.488]  we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:06:49.488 --> 03:06:58.591]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[03:07:01.127 --> 03:07:02.968]  Hi everyone, Andy Anderson here.
[03:07:02.968 --> 03:07:07.390]  Are you using those little bottles of hand gel that kill germs, bacteria, and other nasties?
[03:07:07.390 --> 03:07:13.172]  In today's world, that's smart, especially with the filthy doorknobs, shopping carts, and handrails we touch every day.
[03:07:13.172 --> 03:07:17.514]  Did you know that once the alcohol evaporates in a few seconds, goodbye effectiveness?
[03:07:17.514 --> 03:07:19.215]  No more protection till you use it again.
[03:07:19.375 --> 03:07:20.715]  PureWorks to the rescue!
[03:07:20.715 --> 03:07:25.117]  Our FDA-compliant foam, lotion, soap, and spray do not contain alcohol.
[03:07:25.117 --> 03:07:27.317]  Their killing power lasts up to four hours.
[03:07:27.317 --> 03:07:39.161]  PureWorks Disinfecting Spray is EPA-certified to kill swine flu, bird flu, MRSA, HIV, hepatitis B and C, and for our friends in medicine, kills C. diff, along with a whole host of viruses and bacteria.
[03:07:39.321 --> 03:07:40.361]  Moles and fungus too.
[03:07:40.361 --> 03:07:42.022]  It's even safer around pets and children.
[03:07:42.022 --> 03:07:45.203]  You'll love how your skin feels with PureWorks Soft and Supple.
[03:07:45.203 --> 03:07:46.364]  No more dry skin.

[03:07:59.008 --> 03:08:05.171]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[03:08:05.171 --> 03:08:07.972]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:09.560 --> 03:08:16.989]  We're going to be talking to Dr. Tim Ball, a renowned environmental consultant, former climatology professor at the University of Winnipeg.
[03:08:16.989 --> 03:08:28.542]  Dr. Ball employs his expertise, background in climatology and other fields as an advisor to the International Climate Science Coalition, Friends of Science, and the Frontier Center for Public Policy.
[03:08:30.080 --> 03:08:32.021]  They've called for his arrest in England.
[03:08:32.021 --> 03:08:36.022]  I mean, they've said that he and Lord Monckton and others should just be arrested.
[03:08:36.022 --> 03:08:42.125]  Cass Sunstein, the new regulations czar, says, arrest people if they deny climate change.
[03:08:42.125 --> 03:08:51.149]  So now, all these tens of thousands, I mean, it's 30-something thousand sent letters to Congress, top scientists, climatologists, hydrologists,
[03:08:53.703 --> 03:08:55.363]  Meteorologist.
[03:08:55.363 --> 03:08:57.824]  And Al Gore said that testimony won't be allowed.
[03:08:57.824 --> 03:09:00.605]  His friends in the Democratic Party said no.
[03:09:00.605 --> 03:09:01.485]  Not allowed.
[03:09:01.485 --> 03:09:03.046]  And he said the science is settled.
[03:09:03.046 --> 03:09:04.306]  No one disagrees.
[03:09:04.306 --> 03:09:08.007]  And Obama said that in his speech two nights ago at the State of the Union.
[03:09:08.007 --> 03:09:09.647]  He said, you know, there's no question.
[03:09:09.647 --> 03:09:15.889]  So we're going to Dr. Tim Ball here in just a moment to talk about all those issues with him.
[03:09:15.889 --> 03:09:20.270]  Now we know this is all based on fraudulent science.
[03:09:20.270 --> 03:09:22.831]  It's publicly admitted with their own internal emails and now
[03:09:24.201 --> 03:09:33.960]  More than 10 news scandals where the whole UN, all the universities they use, all a tissue of lies and fraud with them caught red-handed lying on purpose.
[03:09:35.714 --> 03:09:45.684]  I mean, this is like somebody calling the fire department and saying, my neighbor's house is on fire, and then the fire department pulls up and there's no fire, and they see the guy laughing, saying, I lied, I lied.
[03:09:45.684 --> 03:09:48.586]  I mean, he gets arrested for a false report.
[03:09:48.586 --> 03:09:50.789]  I mean, there's no doubt.
[03:09:50.789 --> 03:09:52.650]  We have them red-handed.
[03:09:52.650 --> 03:09:53.651]  But they're not going to stop.
[03:09:53.651 --> 03:09:56.114]  So I wanted to read this because this is the new angle.
[03:09:57.378 --> 03:10:05.523]  In England, the EU, their own government, common purpose, in Canada, in the US, in Europe, in Japan, the federal governments and the UN.
[03:10:06.678 --> 03:10:26.954]  Are just openly funding the cities and the banks and the federal money to seize houses, seize property, shut down power plants, huge boondoggles to Al Gore and others that own these windmill companies that you lose 2.2 jobs on average every time you fund them and they cost $700,000 per green job they create.
[03:10:26.954 --> 03:10:34.440]  So as they kill your economy, they say, Maury Strong's system to destroy industrial society, it will give you jobs.
[03:10:35.200 --> 03:10:40.624]  And so yeah, one out of a hundred or so, they do get a job as enforcers of the destruction.
[03:10:40.624 --> 03:10:44.747]  Meanwhile, China is the new industrial haven where everything's authorized.
[03:10:44.747 --> 03:10:51.052]  So no one else is allowed to manufacture, this is really mercantilism, but China and a few of the third world countries.
[03:10:51.052 --> 03:10:53.154]  They're bringing back mercantilism.
[03:10:53.154 --> 03:11:03.542]  You know, the colonies couldn't produce anything that was a value-added good, only raw cotton, tobacco, things like that, corn, wheat.
[03:11:04.764 --> 03:11:07.045]  That's how the British and French empires operated.
[03:11:07.045 --> 03:11:12.867]  Mercantilism was developed 400 years ago into the system and is now to keep only certain elites in power.
[03:11:12.867 --> 03:11:14.748]  That's what this fake environmentalism is.
[03:11:14.748 --> 03:11:19.810]  We're going to Tim Ball here in a minute, but I wanted to start into this article from PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:11:19.810 --> 03:11:21.211]  It's only been out for about two hours.
[03:11:21.211 --> 03:11:29.715]  I'm asking everyone, especially in cities where it's happening, San Francisco, Austin, Texas, LA, New York, Boston, you had better
[03:11:30.598 --> 03:11:31.918]  Miami.
[03:11:31.918 --> 03:11:33.079]  Small towns, they're doing it.
[03:11:33.079 --> 03:11:34.019]  And I mean, there's U.N.
[03:11:34.019 --> 03:11:36.299]  representatives, the feds are here.
[03:11:36.299 --> 03:11:38.440]  I've been to the meetings, they laugh and admit it.
[03:11:38.440 --> 03:11:40.421]  Home inspectors taking your property.
[03:11:40.421 --> 03:11:42.461]  I mean, it's already been hell here in Austin.
[03:11:42.461 --> 03:11:45.682]  The mayor, former mayors openly take the property later, they took.
[03:11:45.682 --> 03:11:51.243]  I mean, just, it's just walled, it's like Geithner's thieving.
[03:11:51.243 --> 03:11:53.704]  Cap and trade scam to be enforced at state level.
[03:11:53.704 --> 03:11:57.265]  And earlier, I read to you, on air,
[03:11:58.664 --> 03:12:03.809]  All of the mainstream news articles out of Bloomberg, you name it.
[03:12:03.809 --> 03:12:05.891]  I'll show you some of those coming up.
[03:12:05.891 --> 03:12:06.852]  They're here in my stack.
[03:12:06.852 --> 03:12:08.613]  I need to dig them out.
[03:12:08.613 --> 03:12:13.038]  Where they admit, okay, they can't get it at the congressional level with the Senate.
[03:12:13.700 --> 03:12:23.411]  They can't pass this tyranny, so they'll have the EPA at the federal bureaucracy do it, and they'll have local governments do it, and international governments come in and fund your local governments.
[03:12:23.411 --> 03:12:31.940]  So foreign governments coming in with a 2.6 million tax, 2.6 billion dollar tax in Austin alone.
[03:12:35.380 --> 03:12:51.830]  Uh, intent on ushering in a zero-growth post-industrial society or bypassing the federal government's stuttering efforts to implement the cap-and-trade scam and going directly to the states in an effort to impose their control-freak tax on every life-giving gas that we all exhale carbon dioxide.
[03:12:53.849 --> 03:12:55.370]  And it just goes on and on.
[03:12:55.370 --> 03:13:07.136]  It says the Austin Energy, which powers the city, presented to the City Council Austin Energy Carbon Reduction Plan, which goes even further than the federal cap-and-trade bill in calling for CO2 emissions to be reduced by 20%.
[03:13:07.136 --> 03:13:16.161]  The fact that the energy companies are behind this again disproves the flawed notion that the oil and electricity companies oppose the global warming movement.
[03:13:16.161 --> 03:13:17.962]  No, they get all the money to put in the windmills.
[03:13:19.192 --> 03:13:22.413]  And then it's taxes on natural gas, it's home inspections.
[03:13:22.413 --> 03:13:24.193]  I mean, folks, I'm going to read more of this later.
[03:13:24.193 --> 03:13:29.235]  I want to go to Dr. Tim Ball while I dig out my other stories I wanted to go to.
[03:13:29.235 --> 03:13:31.935]  But I mean, this is so diabolical.
[03:13:31.935 --> 03:13:37.257]  And when I tried to tell Dr. Tim Ball during the break about this, he said, yes, I know, Alex, but it's all based on fraud.
[03:13:37.257 --> 03:13:38.957]  And I know that and he knows that.
[03:13:38.957 --> 03:13:47.060]  But you've got to go to your city councils and say, this is all an admitted bonafide scam developed by Enron and the U.N.
[03:13:47.060 --> 03:13:48.240]  It's just so amazing.
[03:13:49.860 --> 03:13:52.201]  Climateologist Tim Ball, thanks for being here with us.
[03:13:52.201 --> 03:14:15.265]  Well thank you Alex, thanks for the opportunity and a very good summary of what's going on and I've watched them hijack climate science as the vehicle and as we've talked about before going back to the Club of Rome where they state that global warming is going to be the vehicle that they'll use to take control and we're seeing that and now even though the biggest scandal
[03:14:16.025 --> 03:14:36.919]  And I think, without hyperbole, the biggest scandal, certainly in science history, and possibly in world history, where people at all levels of government have been involved, and the IPCC and so on, and yet it's virtually being downplayed and pushed aside as, you know, as somebody once said, it's like the policemen say, no, nothing going on here, move along, move along.
[03:14:36.919 --> 03:14:39.060]  And it's absolutely incredible.
[03:14:39.060 --> 03:14:44.283]  And I think what people need to think about, Alex, is if this level of malfeasance and
[03:14:45.464 --> 03:14:52.568]  If pure criminality occurred in any other discipline, I mean, the people would be locked up instantly.
[03:14:52.568 --> 03:14:58.712]  If it occurred in medicine, for example, even a fraction of it.
[03:14:58.712 --> 03:15:09.439]  But somehow, they're able to gloss it over and pretend that nothing's wrong, and then the latest game is, oh no, the fundamental science is still okay.
[03:15:09.439 --> 03:15:14.121]  In fact, John Beddington, the head of the UK science group, saying this, well, no it isn't.
[03:15:17.202 --> 03:15:24.727]  There's now universities, governments admitting thermometer fraud always to make it look like it's hotter.
[03:15:24.727 --> 03:15:30.711]  Caught red-handed in Canada, the US, New Zealand, England, Russia.
[03:15:30.711 --> 03:15:37.136]  And we have the UN documents where they went in the mid-90s and recruited these key universities to unify the fraud.
[03:15:37.136 --> 03:15:42.520]  And Bill Santer, the head of the UN program, admitting they took out all the scientists out of their report.
[03:15:43.160 --> 03:15:46.021]  In the mid-nineties saying, man, is it doing this?
[03:15:46.021 --> 03:15:51.162]  And Pachari making money off shutting down factories and relocating them to India.
[03:15:51.162 --> 03:15:57.023]  And admitting they lied in the report about the melting of the glaciers in the Himalayas.
[03:15:57.023 --> 03:15:59.224]  Admitting, oh, we did that to scare you.
[03:15:59.224 --> 03:16:02.124]  I mean, there's just red-handed fraud everywhere.
[03:16:02.124 --> 03:16:03.865]  Al Gore making money off of it.
[03:16:03.865 --> 03:16:04.765]  The Rothschilds.
[03:16:04.765 --> 03:16:07.106]  The Rockefellers.
[03:16:07.106 --> 03:16:07.986]  Just all of it.
[03:16:09.207 --> 03:16:11.409]  Alex and Pachauri himself.
[03:16:11.409 --> 03:16:13.632]  He's made a huge amount of money.
[03:16:13.632 --> 03:16:27.650]  And in fact, the scientist that was quoted by a reporter as saying that the glaciers in the Himalayas will be gone by 2035, he works for Terra, which is owned and run by Pachauri.
[03:16:27.890 --> 03:16:43.917]  Exactly, it's all come out that every major scientist, whether it's the flu scare, the economists hired for the takeover of healthcare, all the major scientists and spokesmen are all on the payroll of the carbon traders.
[03:16:43.917 --> 03:16:47.259]  I mean, it's just total fraud out in the open.
[03:16:47.259 --> 03:16:52.621]  Right, and I watched it, you know, 30 years ago, a guy named Tom Wigley,
[03:16:53.524 --> 03:17:01.549]  And he was the guy that took control of the Climatic Research Unit, which is where all of the rot was centered from the climate science point of view.
[03:17:01.549 --> 03:17:04.331]  I'm not talking necessarily now about the political side of it.
[03:17:04.331 --> 03:17:07.313]  That was more strong in the UN and the IPCC.
[03:17:07.313 --> 03:17:13.877]  Well, Wigley and Jones, and Jones has now been pushed aside as the head, those two,
[03:17:14.657 --> 03:17:29.760]  ...attended the first meeting in 1985 to set up the IPCC, and then they provided the science that Strong and his gang needed to push this whole agenda of carbon and that CO2 is the problem.
[03:17:30.413 --> 03:17:37.338]  And Wigley was the bag man, and if you read the emails, he's the go-to guy.
[03:17:37.338 --> 03:17:40.380]  He's the grandfather, almost like the Mafia.
[03:17:40.380 --> 03:17:45.123]  And when you read the emails, they're saying, look, we got this problem, and he's telling them how to end Reddit, and how to deal with it.
[03:17:45.123 --> 03:17:47.625]  And he's the guy that's getting editors fired.
[03:17:47.625 --> 03:17:54.929]  Well, then he moved to Canada, probably arranged through Environment Canada and the Assistant Deputy Minister here.
[03:17:54.929 --> 03:17:58.512]  And he got into more funding in Canada.
[03:17:58.512 --> 03:17:59.813]  Then he moved to NCAR.
[03:18:01.014 --> 03:18:05.482]  Where they just had a big retirement party for him attended by all the CRU people.
[03:18:06.064 --> 03:18:07.665]  And all of these gangs.
[03:18:07.665 --> 03:18:12.866]  And so much of the funding was going through NCAR in Boulder, Colorado.
[03:18:12.866 --> 03:18:16.427]  And in fact, a lot of the funding going to the CRU was from there.
[03:18:16.427 --> 03:18:23.369]  So these guys were controlling the government funding that was going to perpetuate the bad science.
[03:18:23.369 --> 03:18:26.810]  Meanwhile, what they were doing was then being used.
[03:18:26.810 --> 03:18:31.512]  The IPCC reports then became the documents of faith.
[03:18:32.248 --> 03:18:41.735]  Four governments around the world pushing the whole carbon and energy agenda.
[03:18:41.735 --> 03:18:42.815]  Yeah.
[03:18:42.815 --> 03:18:45.377]  I mean, I don't know how they're so arrogant.
[03:18:45.377 --> 03:18:48.719]  I mean, I guess they've got all the banking money, all the power on their side.
[03:18:48.719 --> 03:18:51.161]  They're brainwashing all the kids in the schools.
[03:18:51.161 --> 03:18:58.126]  I mean, it is a serious wound to them, though, that ClimateGate now looks mild compared to all the other fraud coming out.
[03:18:58.706 --> 03:19:04.352]  But they run the government that would prosecute them, and George Soros is saying, we're still going to do it.
[03:19:04.352 --> 03:19:08.235]  And the Austin City Council says, we don't care if it wrecks Austin.
[03:19:08.235 --> 03:19:19.887]  We are going to put a $2.6 billion tax in the next three years just to build all these grids and tear out the, and they say they're going to put a huge 20% tax on everybody's natural gas.
[03:19:21.903 --> 03:19:49.782]  Yeah, well, you know, one of the things that has gone on with this is, as I said, using the science base, the false science, but what's come out so far is only the tip of the iceberg, and I don't want to sound cute with that comment, but I know, having watched them create this fraud for over 30 years, and how they commandeered climate science, I know that there's a lot, lot more to come out yet.
[03:19:51.138 --> 03:19:57.361]  I mean, it's just a bunch of criminals all making money off of it, and they're all a bunch of eugenicists, population reductionists.
[03:19:57.361 --> 03:20:01.503]  Let's talk about that and how they're taking over the states.
[03:20:01.503 --> 03:20:02.803]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:20:02.803 --> 03:20:08.406]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[03:20:08.406 --> 03:20:13.428]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[03:20:13.428 --> 03:20:13.888]  It's true.
[03:20:13.888 --> 03:20:18.450]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[03:20:18.982 --> 03:20:24.205]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[03:20:24.205 --> 03:20:26.526]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[03:20:26.526 --> 03:20:31.328]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[03:20:31.328 --> 03:20:32.449]  And here's the best part.
[03:20:32.449 --> 03:20:35.510]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[03:20:35.510 --> 03:20:39.132]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[03:20:39.132 --> 03:20:42.314]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[03:20:42.314 --> 03:20:44.555]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[03:20:44.555 --> 03:20:45.475]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[03:20:49.110 --> 03:20:53.333]  That's 877-327-0365.
[03:20:53.333 --> 03:20:58.176]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[03:20:58.176 --> 03:21:02.598]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[03:21:02.598 --> 03:21:06.621]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:21:06.621 --> 03:21:09.883]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:21:09.883 --> 03:21:11.264]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[03:21:11.989 --> 03:21:14.670]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:21:14.670 --> 03:21:21.052]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:21:21.052 --> 03:21:26.234]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:21:26.234 --> 03:21:36.197]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:21:36.337 --> 03:21:38.698]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:21:38.698 --> 03:21:40.278]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:21:40.278 --> 03:21:42.739]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:21:42.739 --> 03:21:44.859]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[03:21:44.859 --> 03:21:50.020]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[03:22:01.761 --> 03:22:02.782]  Gold isn't for you?
[03:22:02.782 --> 03:22:08.327]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[03:22:08.327 --> 03:22:08.847]  I get it.
[03:22:08.847 --> 03:22:18.495]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[03:22:18.495 --> 03:22:19.896]  That's not what's happening.
[03:22:19.896 --> 03:22:24.260]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation.
[03:22:24.480 --> 03:22:26.322]  Or that the dollar wouldn't lose value.
[03:22:26.322 --> 03:22:28.363]  Or that your retirement would be secure.
[03:22:28.363 --> 03:22:31.746]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[03:22:31.746 --> 03:22:36.009]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[03:22:36.009 --> 03:22:37.610]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[03:22:37.610 --> 03:22:41.574]  dollar index has tanked 30% while gold has risen 300%.
[03:22:41.574 --> 03:22:45.397]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[03:22:45.397 --> 03:22:46.297]  You should too.
[03:22:46.297 --> 03:22:47.458]  Find out what they know.
[03:22:47.458 --> 03:22:50.701]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[03:22:50.981 --> 03:22:51.281]  800-686-2237.
[03:22:51.281 --> 03:22:52.862]  800-686-2237.
[03:22:52.862 --> 03:23:07.532]  That's 800-686-2237.
[03:23:07.532 --> 03:23:09.113]  Aerial spraying.
[03:23:09.113 --> 03:23:10.334]  Chemtrails.
[03:23:10.334 --> 03:23:12.496]  The modified atmosphere.
[03:23:12.496 --> 03:23:14.697]  Heavy metals and pesticides.
[03:23:14.697 --> 03:23:18.480]  Carcinogens and chemical fibers all falling from the sky.
[03:23:19.266 --> 03:23:22.369]  You have a choice to keep your body clean.
[03:23:22.369 --> 03:23:29.577]  Detoxify with micro plant powder from hempusa.org or call 908-691-2608.
[03:23:29.577 --> 03:23:36.784]  It's odorless and tasteless and used in any liquid or food.
[03:23:36.784 --> 03:23:40.669]  Protect your family now with micro plant powder.
[03:23:40.669 --> 03:23:41.930]  Cleaning out heavy metals
[03:23:42.398 --> 03:23:42.979]  I think so.
[03:24:10.508 --> 03:24:12.192]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[03:24:12.192 --> 03:24:12.794]  to 3 p.m.
[03:24:12.794 --> 03:24:14.258]  We're here live standard time.
[03:24:14.258 --> 03:24:17.446]  We'll be back live Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:24:17.446 --> 03:24:19.030]  Never Medina on and others.
[03:24:20.520 --> 03:24:23.901]  You know, we have this article, cap-and-trade scam to be enforced at state level.
[03:24:23.901 --> 03:24:31.184]  Individuals and businesses in Austin and a plethora of other states to be taxed for emissions on life-giving gas, carbon dioxide, and everything else.
[03:24:31.184 --> 03:24:37.566]  That's... Read the whole article, get it out to everybody you know in every major city so you know what's happening.
[03:24:37.566 --> 03:24:39.107]  They call it green jobs.
[03:24:39.107 --> 03:24:40.747]  It has nothing to do with that.
[03:24:40.747 --> 03:24:41.688]  Here's Bloomberg.
[03:24:41.688 --> 03:24:45.349]  States to lead carbon markets as federal plans stalls.
[03:24:45.349 --> 03:24:45.809]  Bloomberg.
[03:24:45.809 --> 03:24:47.510]  In fact, give me a document cam shot here.
[03:24:48.965 --> 03:24:52.047]  States to lead carbon markets as federal plans stalls.
[03:24:52.047 --> 03:24:53.849]  Right there.
[03:24:53.849 --> 03:25:03.696]  We have the other article here, which has a direct link to the City Council, saying $2.6 billion just to launch the program.
[03:25:03.696 --> 03:25:07.639]  And again, for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, there's the Bloomberg article.
[03:25:07.639 --> 03:25:11.662]  Here's, energy plan comes to City Council as legislature plans review.
[03:25:11.662 --> 03:25:14.384]  How can the city be run by foreign private corporations?
[03:25:14.884 --> 03:25:18.625]  Austin Energy unveils carbon calculator at Expo.
[03:25:18.625 --> 03:25:22.467]  They're putting in the smart thermostats in your houses without asking you.
[03:25:22.467 --> 03:25:25.088]  They say they're going to control the temperature in your house.
[03:25:25.088 --> 03:25:26.929]  California's doing it.
[03:25:26.929 --> 03:25:35.592]  Obama laughed at, after calling climate change evidence overwhelming, Dr. Tim Ball, top climatologist, who's been persecuted by these people.
[03:25:36.533 --> 03:25:39.758]  I mean, this is total financial feudalism.
[03:25:39.758 --> 03:25:42.141]  This is total domination.
[03:25:42.141 --> 03:25:44.064]  Canada, where you live, is even worse.
[03:25:44.064 --> 03:25:47.069]  You've already had multiple states up there past this.
[03:25:47.069 --> 03:25:50.775]  I mean, it's devastated Spain, and they love it.
[03:25:52.005 --> 03:26:08.149]  Well, you know, in the province that I live in, British Columbia, on the west coast here, and one of the problems that I have with Canada is we've got more oil and energy and resources than virtually any country in the world, yet we're paying top prices.
[03:26:08.149 --> 03:26:08.809]  It's unbelievable.
[03:26:08.809 --> 03:26:11.250]  It's like paying restaurant prices for food in your own home.
[03:26:12.110 --> 03:26:22.072]  And one of the things in British Columbia here is that we were the first province, jurisdiction in North America to introduce a carbon tax.
[03:26:22.072 --> 03:26:34.515]  And what's annoying about it is that the Premier, before he got elected, he attended a presentation that I gave and said afterwards, I want to talk with you and get you to talk to my environment minister.
[03:26:35.095 --> 03:26:35.936]  I think so.
[03:26:51.380 --> 03:26:54.801]  And then, what happens three years later?
[03:26:54.801 --> 03:27:07.185]  Suddenly, he's introducing a carbon tax, and they're putting a billion dollars of taxpayer money into all of these absolutely useless schemes to combat climate change.
[03:27:07.185 --> 03:27:09.606]  And I discover who's behind it all?
[03:27:09.606 --> 03:27:10.786]  Andrew Weaver.
[03:27:10.786 --> 03:27:11.906]  And who's Andrew Weaver?
[03:27:11.906 --> 03:27:16.468]  He's the lead author of the chapters on the computer models at the IPCC.
[03:27:17.368 --> 03:27:17.968]  And by the way,
[03:27:48.939 --> 03:27:52.741]  And by the way, on screen we have the Austin Energy Calculator.
[03:27:52.741 --> 03:27:55.302]  It's similar to what Enron did.
[03:27:55.302 --> 03:27:57.964]  Secretary of the Army White ran it before he went to the Army.
[03:27:57.964 --> 03:28:08.129]  They had fake computer models to show people how they didn't have any energy, so they had to triple and quadruple, in some cases even more money, and then it turned out it was all just a made-up scam.
[03:28:08.129 --> 03:28:14.933]  They're just seizing our energy and saying they're going to jack up our prices, and they make little fake computer graphics for the morons.
[03:28:16.058 --> 03:28:20.440]  Well, Alex, the carbon credits thing, there's been so many scams with it already.
[03:28:20.440 --> 03:28:34.248]  I mean, for example, when they first introduced it at the international level, that is, trading between nations, they very quickly discovered that Germany and Turkey were cooking the books.
[03:28:34.248 --> 03:28:39.830]  That they were deliberately giving false information about the CO2 that they were producing as nations.
[03:28:39.830 --> 03:28:44.373]  And India and China won't even sign on and don't have to, meaning all our jobs will go there.
[03:28:44.933 --> 03:28:45.554]  Exactly.
[03:28:45.554 --> 03:28:50.238]  And so they already had the scam going.
[03:28:50.238 --> 03:29:08.954]  And one of the things, by the way, and I talked earlier about the tip of the iceberg, what people don't know is that the statistics on the amount of CO2 that humans are producing globally, and the current figure is given, I think it's about 7.5 gigatons, that number is produced by the IPCC.
[03:29:10.531 --> 03:29:11.952]  They're cooking that number as well.
[03:29:11.952 --> 03:29:17.876]  But even with that number, they say humans are 3-6% of carbon dioxide increase.
[03:29:17.876 --> 03:29:18.416]  Right?
[03:29:18.416 --> 03:29:23.039]  Now, you ask yourself, first of all they say, oh well they get the basic number from each country.
[03:29:23.039 --> 03:29:26.481]  How many countries in the world know exactly what CO2 they're producing?
[03:29:26.806 --> 03:29:27.807]  No, they just make it up.
[03:29:27.807 --> 03:29:29.948]  Stay... Dr. Tim Ball, stay there.
[03:29:29.948 --> 03:29:31.449]  Long segment coming up.
[03:29:31.449 --> 03:29:39.514]  Let's get into a chronicle of all their fraud, not just Climategate, and where they're going, and then a little bit more about how they're taking over in your town.
[03:29:39.514 --> 03:29:43.297]  You'll hear it's green jobs and, oh, some windmills.
[03:29:43.297 --> 03:29:45.118]  That's just the window dressing.
[03:29:45.118 --> 03:29:49.320]  It means carbon taxes and carbon trading ripping you off.
[03:29:49.320 --> 03:29:51.582]  2.6 bill in Austin.
[03:29:51.582 --> 03:29:52.983]  We're on the march.
[03:29:52.983 --> 03:29:54.484]  The empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.482 --> 03:30:01.066]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.066 --> 03:30:06.430]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[03:30:06.430 --> 03:30:09.171]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[03:30:09.171 --> 03:30:14.515]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[03:30:14.515 --> 03:30:15.896]  Friends, I hope you will order
[03:30:15.896 --> 03:30:18.978]  Order Shadow Government from InfoWars.com.

[03:30:35.147 --> 03:30:36.988]  This film needs to be seen.
[03:30:36.988 --> 03:30:38.149]  Everybody needs to get it.

[03:31:02.684 --> 03:31:06.707]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:31:06.707 --> 03:31:09.949]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:31:09.949 --> 03:31:11.350]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[03:31:12.057 --> 03:31:14.720]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:31:14.720 --> 03:31:21.126]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:31:21.126 --> 03:31:26.311]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:31:26.311 --> 03:31:36.300]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:31:36.420 --> 03:31:38.762]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:31:38.762 --> 03:31:40.363]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:31:40.363 --> 03:31:42.805]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:31:42.805 --> 03:31:44.926]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:31:44.926 --> 03:31:50.090]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:31:50.090 --> 03:31:55.094]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[03:32:02.285 --> 03:32:03.066]  Hi, neighbor.
[03:32:03.066 --> 03:32:06.368]  They say the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
[03:32:06.368 --> 03:32:11.652]  Certainly we'd never intend to procrastinate getting our own food supply until there was none left at any price.
[03:32:11.652 --> 03:32:17.396]  We would intend to have plenty of food so the relief organizations could care for those unable to care for themselves.
[03:32:17.396 --> 03:32:25.001]  We would intend not to be standing in the breadline with the ignorant and the foolish who pretend the facts of food disappearance are untrue.
[03:32:25.001 --> 03:32:29.905]  If the experience of the Katrina disaster is evidence, the breadline may have no bread.
[03:32:30.525 --> 03:32:38.351]  Just like the good intentions on the road to that unheavenly place, the good intentions alone to get a supply of food will not feed us.
[03:32:38.351 --> 03:32:43.455]  Only getting our food supply immediately will make us independent and fearless for the future.
[03:32:43.455 --> 03:32:43.755]  Call 800-409-5633.
[03:32:43.755 --> 03:32:43.835]  800-409-5633.
[03:32:43.835 --> 03:32:44.816]  On the web, efoodsdirect.com.
[03:32:44.816 --> 03:32:45.036]  Who am I?
[03:32:45.036 --> 03:32:45.596]  Someone who cares.
[03:33:02.509 --> 03:33:22.902]  While you were sleeping They came and took it all away The lanes and the meadows The places where you used to play
[03:33:28.177 --> 03:33:37.900]  Alright, I've got a bunch of Twitter questions for Dr. Tim Ball.
[03:33:37.900 --> 03:33:42.742]  Our new Twitter account is Twitter.com forward slash RealAlexJones.
[03:33:42.742 --> 03:33:45.282]  Twitter.com forward slash RealAlexJones.
[03:33:45.282 --> 03:33:49.424]  We have the Prison Planet Twitter, and we have the InfoWar Stories Twitter.
[03:33:49.424 --> 03:33:52.865]  They send out feeds of our articles as soon as they come out.
[03:33:52.865 --> 03:33:56.446]  But this one is the interactive Twitter that I'm on day and night, off and on.
[03:33:56.926 --> 03:33:59.346]  And that the crew is on as well.
[03:33:59.346 --> 03:34:00.947]  And we certainly have sent a lot of good info.
[03:34:00.947 --> 03:34:06.808]  There's some photos we put up there on the Twitter of myself and Dean Hagelin.
[03:34:06.808 --> 03:34:17.409]  Before we go back to Dr. Tim Ball and ask him some of these questions and get into kind of a chronicle of the fraud, I want people to understand, if we don't get the word out about this, they win.
[03:34:17.409 --> 03:34:22.510]  Every time we get out and expose them and all the things they're involved in, they fail.
[03:34:22.510 --> 03:34:25.751]  So they're trying to go at us at the state, county, and city level.
[03:34:26.638 --> 03:34:30.620]  I want to tell you about a few of our sponsors that made today's show possible.
[03:34:30.620 --> 03:34:31.581]  Are you prepared?
[03:34:31.581 --> 03:34:34.423]  Do you have what you need to get you and your loved ones through a crisis?
[03:34:34.423 --> 03:34:38.245]  There is a great weapon everybody should have in his or her arsenal.
[03:34:38.245 --> 03:34:40.606]  That is the New Silver Solution.
[03:34:40.606 --> 03:34:46.670]  The patented silver solution can be used for all sorts of things, from water purification to wound care to everything in between.
[03:34:46.670 --> 03:34:48.211]  Amazing studies on their site.
[03:34:48.211 --> 03:34:51.753]  Arm yourself with New Silver Solution and be prepared for whatever comes your way.
[03:34:51.753 --> 03:34:53.754]  Go to SupernaturalSilver.com.
[03:34:53.754 --> 03:34:55.816]  That's SupernaturalSilver.com today.

[03:35:05.310 --> 03:35:06.271]  SupernaturalSilver.com
[03:35:09.048 --> 03:35:11.571]  Also, I want to tell you about MySolarBackup.com.
[03:35:11.571 --> 03:35:22.321]  See, I'm all for solar systems, but these big, giant ones that are old technology and where they shut down the power plants to make you go on it is a scam.
[03:35:22.321 --> 03:35:33.232]  What you need is great little units that have the little battery unit, the little control unit, the panel, run several good-sized appliances, get a bunch of them, run your whole house, great for campsites.
[03:35:34.366 --> 03:35:35.347]  Great for the road.
[03:35:35.347 --> 03:35:37.248]  Check it out at MySolarBackup.com.

[03:35:44.511 --> 03:35:50.254]  The globalists don't own the sun yet, folks, so take action today.
[03:35:50.254 --> 03:35:52.356]  Again, their takeover has nothing to do with solar panels.
[03:35:52.356 --> 03:35:53.536]  That's just their window dressing.
[03:35:53.536 --> 03:35:54.457]  It's all about taxes.
[03:35:55.629 --> 03:35:55.989]  Yeah.
[03:36:10.802 --> 03:36:12.885]  Get you off the grid and grabs water out of the air.
[03:36:12.885 --> 03:36:15.489]  In fact, you can run one of these with a solar backup system.
[03:36:15.489 --> 03:36:20.957]  acolablue.com, E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E dot com, or give them a call at 800-691-6043, or go to convoyofhope.org to check out what they're doing.
[03:36:27.226 --> 03:36:36.754]  And because of the overwhelming need in Haiti, Ecolablue is donating 20% of every Ecolablue 28 and Ecolablue 30 units sold to Convoy of Hope to benefit the relief efforts in Haiti.
[03:36:36.754 --> 03:36:38.556]  Plus, it's a great system for you to get.
[03:36:38.556 --> 03:36:40.297]  Check out these amazing units.
[03:36:40.297 --> 03:36:43.920]  The cleanest water you can get, bar none, right out of the atmosphere and then filtered.
[03:36:43.920 --> 03:36:45.982]  Ecolablue.com.
[03:36:45.982 --> 03:36:50.245]  Okay, moving quickly now before I get to the Twitter questions for Dr. Tim Ball.
[03:36:50.245 --> 03:36:56.010]  Sir, let's get into the fraud because any one of these stories, and it's got to be more than 10 of them in the last
[03:36:56.906 --> 03:37:04.751]  Well, yeah, it's based on the theory or hypothesis that CO2 is causing climate change, warming and then climate change.
[03:37:22.637 --> 03:37:25.699]  And, of course, this is what the problem they got into.
[03:37:25.699 --> 03:37:27.621]  They chose that vehicle.
[03:37:27.621 --> 03:37:35.147]  And then, of course, what they had to do was to make sure that the science proved what they were claiming.
[03:37:35.147 --> 03:37:39.130]  And that goes completely against the normal scientific method.
[03:37:39.130 --> 03:37:43.553]  A scientist creates a hypothesis, then other scientists try to disprove it.
[03:37:43.553 --> 03:37:46.235]  What they've been doing is trying to prove it.
[03:37:46.235 --> 03:37:50.979]  And, of course, every time somebody asks a question, like myself, they either have to
[03:37:51.699 --> 03:37:53.100]  We're good to go.
[03:38:09.278 --> 03:38:21.124]  And they talk about it in the emails, how they were the goons, they were the hit squad that covered the backs of these guys that were creating the lies and covering the falsehoods.
[03:38:21.124 --> 03:38:27.368]  And of course then they also got into the problem that once they convinced, once they as bureaucrats
[03:38:27.928 --> 03:38:35.571]  But now a lot of the top scientists who have even been supporting this are coming out and saying, I guess it is okay to have a scientific debate.
[03:38:35.571 --> 03:38:36.771]  That is the scientific method.
[03:38:57.438 --> 03:39:15.424]  Well, exactly, but one of the things that's very interesting about this, and I wrote an article in Canada Free Press a little while ago about it, and that is the degree to which these people were able to bully individuals and powerful people at corporations and, you know, governments.
[03:39:15.424 --> 03:39:17.245]  Because they had the government purse strings!
[03:39:19.904 --> 03:39:30.947]  I know, for example, in Canada, they would put out documents, and of course the Canadian public have a much more, a much greater faith in public, in government stuff than Americans do.
[03:39:30.947 --> 03:39:34.448]  You've got a healthy disrespect for government, which is great.
[03:39:34.448 --> 03:39:37.709]  But yeah, they could use the taxpayers' money to lie to them.
[03:39:38.409 --> 03:39:51.538]  And so, but they got on this treadmill, but what's gradually happened, of course, and now all those scientists that were bullied into silence, and I can't tell you how many that spoke to me, Alex.
[03:39:51.538 --> 03:39:57.602]  I remember government employees that I gave a presentation after this, they said, we agree with you, but we're afraid to say anything.
[03:39:58.280 --> 03:40:08.929]  So that's why this is imploding so badly for them now, is so many people were tired of being bullied, more stuff's getting leaked literally every day, devastating them more and more.
[03:40:08.929 --> 03:40:16.635]  So what do you think they're going to do as all the fraud just mounts, it already has, to just completely biblical proportions?
[03:40:16.635 --> 03:40:19.598]  What are they going to do, just rebrand it and keep stealing?
[03:40:19.598 --> 03:40:27.244]  Well, the first thing that's going to happen is already happening, and that is they're appointing, they're doing the old phony thing of, oh, we'll have a
[03:40:28.819 --> 03:40:30.063]  The Warren Commission!
[03:40:30.063 --> 03:40:31.548]  Or the 9-11 Commission!
[03:40:31.548 --> 03:40:32.130]  Exactly!
[03:40:33.558 --> 03:40:49.264]  And as I think we might have talked about, I've served on these commissions, and I realize that they're the perfect vehicle for politicians to avoid an issue, to push it aside, because while the commissions, they say to the media, well, I can't talk about it until we get the report.
[03:40:49.264 --> 03:40:58.908]  But what I found out with the very first commission I was on, that the terms of reference that they wrote meant that I couldn't possibly reach to get to the truth.
[03:40:59.687 --> 03:41:08.335]  Well that's like the 9-11 Commission said, we know 19 hijackers did this and all we're doing is recommending what should be done and then that was pure police state.
[03:41:10.564 --> 03:41:14.528]  It's in the terms of reference that this is how they control these commissions.
[03:41:14.528 --> 03:41:15.969]  The commission looks like it's nice.
[03:41:15.969 --> 03:41:17.070]  Oh, it's its arm's length.
[03:41:17.070 --> 03:41:18.572]  No, we're not controlling it.
[03:41:18.572 --> 03:41:21.474]  But in fact, we're controlling it through the terms of reference.
[03:41:21.474 --> 03:41:27.100]  And the classic story, when they asked Judge Warren about the Kennedy assassination.
[03:41:27.100 --> 03:41:29.382]  So what about the Mafia in Dallas?
[03:41:29.382 --> 03:41:31.384]  He said, well, that wasn't in my terms of reference.
[03:41:32.418 --> 03:41:35.442]  And bingo, I knew exactly what he was saying.
[03:41:35.442 --> 03:41:37.985]  And because I'd gone through that.
[03:41:37.985 --> 03:41:39.567]  But they look like they're good things.
[03:41:39.567 --> 03:41:47.417]  Now what they're setting up in Britain, they've already appointed somebody to look at the climatic... And he's one of the top global warming people!
[03:41:49.019 --> 03:41:50.320]  Exactly.
[03:41:50.320 --> 03:41:53.204]  This is part of a continued cover-up.
[03:41:53.204 --> 03:41:56.627]  And so that will be the first thing.
[03:41:56.627 --> 03:42:10.963]  But as the leaks and as the information come out, and what's interesting with this, Alex, is you look at the Pew Center poll that came out recently, where it showed that in a list of 21 concerns, global warming was the very dead last.
[03:42:11.563 --> 03:42:27.049]  And it was only a concern for 28% of the people, and yet the politicians are ignoring that, in the same way that they, you know, you see it in the U.S., the anger amongst the people about what's going on, and yet it's being ignored.
[03:42:28.490 --> 03:42:31.131]  The politicians are not listening to the public voice.
[03:42:31.131 --> 03:42:40.997]  Now, one of the reasons that's gone on is because the politicians were terrified that somebody was able to say, oh, well, you don't care about the environment.
[03:42:40.997 --> 03:42:42.657]  You don't care about the children.
[03:42:42.657 --> 03:42:45.619]  This is the emotional blackmail that went on.
[03:42:45.619 --> 03:42:48.781]  And Michael Crichton wrote about this in his book, State of Fear.
[03:42:50.117 --> 03:42:53.718]  And he said this is a criminal takeover of all the resources by a new Soviet.
[03:43:07.321 --> 03:43:08.102]  Well, exactly.
[03:43:08.102 --> 03:43:15.252]  And I remember listening to him in New York at the first World Conference of the so-called skeptics.
[03:43:15.252 --> 03:43:18.256]  And he said, we've gone through 70 years of communism.
[03:43:18.256 --> 03:43:20.099]  Why the hell would you want to go back to that?
[03:43:21.164 --> 03:43:28.772]  But now they repackage it as loving liberalness, but it's the big banks financing it because they want a controlled market.
[03:43:28.772 --> 03:43:32.436]  Government, absolute government can give them absolute monopolies.
[03:43:32.436 --> 03:43:40.705]  I want to throw out questions to you from some of the Twitter people, because we have the new Twitter account, twitter.com forward slash realalexjones.
[03:43:40.705 --> 03:43:42.727]  Folks sign up there for real-time interaction.
[03:43:45.031 --> 03:43:51.356]  Somebody wants to ask you about the polar shift and the elites using this control on us.
[03:43:51.356 --> 03:44:04.746]  I mean, I know they admit they have some tectonic weapons they claim they have, but I don't think there's any proof that they could cause a polar shift, but we do know that naturally happens, and I've read reports that the polls have been moving lately more than they had previously.
[03:44:06.428 --> 03:44:17.935]  The magnetic pole rotates in a circle over a period of time around the true pole, and yes, there was a fairly rapid movement of it.
[03:44:17.935 --> 03:44:25.420]  I think about ten years ago it was centered in King William Island in the Canadian Arctic, and it's been tracking south.
[03:44:25.420 --> 03:44:30.723]  But the rate of that movement of that pole is variable.
[03:44:30.723 --> 03:44:35.266]  That's a normal wobble, so when the media says, oh my god, the pole's moving, that's normal?
[03:44:35.586 --> 03:44:36.067]  Yeah.
[03:44:36.067 --> 03:44:48.098]  Now, what is important is, and I raised this before a parliamentary committee 20 years ago, and I did it sort of tongue-in-cheek at the time, trying to explain to them how science works with hypotheses.
[03:44:48.098 --> 03:44:52.943]  We know the strength of the Earth's magnetic field has been weakening for about a thousand years.
[03:44:54.012 --> 03:44:59.036]  And some people think that this is heading towards a polar reversal.
[03:44:59.036 --> 03:45:02.359]  That is, the magnetic poles literally flip.
[03:45:02.359 --> 03:45:06.382]  So the South Pole becomes the North Pole magnetically and vice versa.
[03:45:06.382 --> 03:45:15.709]  And I raised it, as I said, tongue-in-cheek at a parliamentary committee, saying, look, I can stand up here all day and create scary scenarios.
[03:45:15.709 --> 03:45:16.950]  Which one are you going to deal with?
[03:45:17.611 --> 03:45:19.092]  What about the UN a few days ago?
[03:45:19.092 --> 03:45:22.595]  First Danny Glover, now UN spokesman saying global warming caused
[03:45:34.065 --> 03:45:38.248]  The plate shift that caused the earthquake in Haiti two and a half weeks ago.
[03:45:38.248 --> 03:45:41.811]  I mean, I'm no climatologist, but I mean, I've read the science.
[03:45:41.811 --> 03:45:51.338]  No one has ever said that the atmosphere is in any way a driver of tectonic plates floating around on the mantle.
[03:45:53.080 --> 03:46:04.507]  The only way that there can be any possible connection is that the atmosphere creates the winds, and the winds drive the ocean currents at the surface, but they don't drive the deep ocean currents.
[03:46:04.507 --> 03:46:13.173]  And you can get situations where water can pile up in a particular area because of the wind patterns, but those are relatively constant.
[03:46:13.173 --> 03:46:19.837]  But when we're talking about movement of the tectonic plates, we're talking about movement within the mantle of the Earth, that is, underneath the crust.
[03:46:20.773 --> 03:46:32.819]  The bottom line is, it's ridiculous, and I'm right, it's ridiculous, it's literally out of left field, to say earthquakes are man's carbon dioxide and cows farting.
[03:46:32.819 --> 03:46:34.520]  It's absolute rubbish.
[03:46:34.520 --> 03:46:42.203]  And as I said, we could spend all day creating these kind of scary scenarios, and which ones are you going to deal with?
[03:46:42.203 --> 03:46:47.926]  This is part of the issue, of course, Alex, you see, they're saying we've got to create a risk-free world.
[03:46:47.926 --> 03:46:49.427]  It never was a risk-free world.
[03:46:49.687 --> 03:46:57.818]  Well, I mean, now they've shifted, because it's not global warming, now they admit it's getting colder, to climate stability.
[03:46:57.818 --> 03:47:00.982]  Everybody knows climate changes constantly.
[03:47:00.982 --> 03:47:03.085]  Look at the dinosaurs, what they lived in.
[03:47:03.085 --> 03:47:05.067]  I mean, it's just asinine.
[03:47:07.227 --> 03:47:07.868]  Yeah, I think so.
[03:47:31.568 --> 03:47:36.231]  That's why they believe that we were only hit every million years or so by a mega asteroid.
[03:47:36.231 --> 03:47:41.675]  Now that they're studying the other planets, they go, no, looks like it's every 300 years on average.
[03:47:41.675 --> 03:47:44.036]  We're going to get hit by something really big.
[03:47:44.036 --> 03:47:54.423]  Okay, now if you've got the public believing that change is very gradual over long periods of time, it allows them to say any change which is occurring naturally, oh, that's not natural.
[03:47:54.423 --> 03:47:57.905]  So what they're doing is they're telling you that natural events are unnatural.
[03:47:58.545 --> 03:48:07.688]  And of course that means they can never be wrong and tomorrow there's going to be more... But I mean, look at volcanoes blowing up on the Aztecs and the Romans and the Greeks and the Japanese.
[03:48:07.688 --> 03:48:12.170]  I mean, there's constantly asteroids hitting and earthquakes and floods.
[03:48:12.170 --> 03:48:13.510]  I mean, this is normal.
[03:48:13.510 --> 03:48:14.810]  Exactly.
[03:48:14.810 --> 03:48:20.152]  And when you start to plot out, for example, they're saying, oh, there's more tornadoes and they're more severe.
[03:48:20.152 --> 03:48:22.673]  When you look at the record, that's simply not the case.
[03:48:22.673 --> 03:48:25.414]  And in the US... They've just got better radar to record them all now.
[03:48:26.857 --> 03:48:30.204]  Also, there are more people out there to see them.
[03:48:30.204 --> 03:48:31.006]  Okay?
[03:48:31.006 --> 03:48:36.477]  But one of the things in the U.S., for example, the worst loss of life to tornadoes in the U.S.
[03:48:36.477 --> 03:48:36.697]  was in 1905.
[03:48:40.296 --> 03:48:47.479]  Look, look, that's why all these farmhouses in Texas and Kansas and Oklahoma and Illinois have got storm shelters in them.
[03:48:47.479 --> 03:48:48.520]  Exactly.
[03:48:48.520 --> 03:48:49.120]  Exactly.
[03:48:49.120 --> 03:49:01.626]  But as I said, this idea that they can present to you that normal change is not normal, and therefore if it's not normal, that automatically equates to, oh, it must be something that humans are doing.
[03:49:02.475 --> 03:49:04.555]  Alright, and this is the common denominator.
[03:49:04.555 --> 03:49:07.396]  Oh, it's always got to be the blame of humans.
[03:49:07.396 --> 03:49:12.797]  And you see Osama Bin Laden, oh, it's the Americans causing global warming.
[03:49:12.797 --> 03:49:14.017]  Okay?
[03:49:14.017 --> 03:49:21.218]  Every time you look at any of these things, it always comes back to it's something that humans are doing that are causing these natural disasters.
[03:49:21.218 --> 03:49:22.959]  But I mean, look how ridiculous that is!
[03:49:22.959 --> 03:49:27.299]  AP says, we don't even know if this is Bin Laden, but the news is saying it's him.
[03:49:27.299 --> 03:49:29.880]  They might as well have the Cheshire Cat say it.
[03:49:31.092 --> 03:49:42.376]  You know, I was on a radio program a few years ago, and afterwards they showed me on the computer, they played My Voice, their voice recognition, and at the computer printing that out is old hat.
[03:49:42.376 --> 03:49:43.576]  There's nothing new.
[03:49:43.576 --> 03:49:49.698]  But then they could take individual letters out of the words I had spoken, make up new words, and the computer would say that in my voice.
[03:49:49.698 --> 03:49:52.839]  And electronically, you wouldn't know that wasn't me.
[03:49:52.839 --> 03:50:00.682]  And there's a lawsuit, I believe it's still in the courts now, where they want to produce Elvis singing songs he never sang in his lifetime.
[03:50:02.169 --> 03:50:08.552]  And by taking individual notes out of his... Exactly, they could fake video, audio, but they were so lazy they didn't even do that.
[03:50:08.552 --> 03:50:12.755]  Quickly, some more... There's no way of knowing that it... I think Osama Bin Laden is dead.
[03:50:12.755 --> 03:50:18.097]  He's got liver, he's on dialysis.
[03:50:18.097 --> 03:50:23.000]  I don't, you know... And $25 million award.
[03:50:23.000 --> 03:50:25.101]  You haven't heard a word about anybody trying to get that.
[03:50:26.055 --> 03:50:36.165]  Now, Dr. Ball, we're going to come back in the final segment and I want to go over a few of these other questions, like how much of an increase in taxes the middle class people due to the global warming hoax?
[03:50:36.165 --> 03:50:38.988]  And you can answer that as a Canadian.
[03:50:38.988 --> 03:50:41.590]  Also, we've got another question.
[03:50:41.590 --> 03:50:47.876]  Can you get into how a mild warming is good for farms and how cooling cycles are the abnormality in real change?
[03:50:48.837 --> 03:50:50.240]  I don't know if that's the case.
[03:50:50.240 --> 03:50:52.223]  I think change is the constant.
[03:50:52.223 --> 03:50:55.970]  And a few other questions for Dr. Tim Ball on the other side of this quick break.
[03:50:55.970 --> 03:50:59.516]  PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars.com.
[03:50:59.516 --> 03:51:01.138]  We're very honored to have Dr. Ball with us today.

[03:51:06.991 --> 03:51:15.137]  Take pills and capsules with only about a 10-20% absorption rate, or take 10-in-1 liquid vitamin and mineral supplement at up to a 98% absorption rate.
[03:51:15.137 --> 03:51:17.239]  Yes, 10 formulas in 1 bottle.
[03:51:17.239 --> 03:51:20.302]  10-in-1 liquid supplement is in your system in as little as 3 minutes.
[03:51:20.882 --> 03:51:22.003]  Just shake it and take it!
[03:51:39.039 --> 03:51:39.499]  Money too!
[03:52:03.138 --> 03:52:07.164]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:52:07.164 --> 03:52:10.408]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:52:10.408 --> 03:52:11.810]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[03:52:12.535 --> 03:52:15.177]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:52:15.177 --> 03:52:21.583]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:52:21.583 --> 03:52:26.788]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:52:26.788 --> 03:52:30.051]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[03:52:30.051 --> 03:52:36.757]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:52:36.877 --> 03:52:39.218]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:52:39.218 --> 03:52:40.819]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:52:40.819 --> 03:52:43.281]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:52:43.281 --> 03:52:45.402]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:52:45.402 --> 03:52:50.566]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:52:50.566 --> 03:52:59.671]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:53:01.778 --> 03:53:05.040]  Have your house payments skyrocketed under an adjustable rate mortgage?
[03:53:05.040 --> 03:53:07.021]  Have you been laid off?
[03:53:07.021 --> 03:53:08.761]  Or had your hours cut?
[03:53:08.761 --> 03:53:10.982]  Are balloon payments coming due?
[03:53:10.982 --> 03:53:14.844]  You need help from MortgageFraudExaminers.com.
[03:53:14.844 --> 03:53:21.267]  To stop the housing crisis, Congress and the White House are pinning their hopes on homeowners renegotiating their mortgages.
[03:53:21.267 --> 03:53:25.429]  The trouble is, the banks are saying no 80% of the time.
[03:53:25.429 --> 03:53:28.551]  MortgageFraudExaminers.com can help you get the leverage you need
[03:53:32.790 --> 03:53:33.150]  I think so.
[03:54:04.440 --> 03:54:07.021]  I'll be back Sunday live, 4 to 6 Central.
[03:54:07.021 --> 03:54:09.542]  5 to 7 Eastern.
[03:54:09.542 --> 03:54:14.204]  From Austin, Texas, the home of the immortal Willie Nelson.
[03:54:14.204 --> 03:54:14.924]  Minnie a soldier.
[03:54:30.960 --> 03:54:33.162]  Ball of the Republic.
[03:54:33.162 --> 03:54:34.143]  Dr. Tim Ball's in it.
[03:54:34.143 --> 03:54:35.565]  Most powerful film ever made.
[03:54:35.565 --> 03:54:37.627]  Available at InfoWars.com.
[03:54:37.627 --> 03:54:38.848]  Get the DVD today.
[03:54:38.848 --> 03:54:41.871]  Got free t-shirt and video deals up there on the site.
[03:54:41.871 --> 03:54:44.214]  Got a few final questions for Dr. Tim Ball.
[03:54:44.214 --> 03:54:47.377]  In the last minute of the show, cue it up to Kramer talking about the Illuminati.
[03:54:47.617 --> 03:54:53.945]  We have all these shows talking about the Illuminati, the New World Order, Bloomberg comes out and says secret Kabbalah bankers run the planet.
[03:54:53.945 --> 03:54:56.187]  That's on Infowars.com.
[03:54:56.187 --> 03:54:57.589]  The Kramer clip's up there.
[03:54:57.589 --> 03:54:58.690]  It's insane.
[03:54:58.690 --> 03:55:03.136]  Dr. Tim Ball, why do you think they're just coming out with everything now and just throwing it in our face?
[03:55:05.083 --> 03:55:10.287]  Well, in the sense of, you know, BS baffles brains, I guess.
[03:55:10.287 --> 03:55:16.573]  You know, if you throw enough information out there, people get so confused they tend to turn off from it.
[03:55:16.573 --> 03:55:20.156]  And that's been one of the issues with the whole climate issue.
[03:55:20.156 --> 03:55:24.880]  Because, for example, Alex, I would not participate in debates.
[03:55:24.880 --> 03:55:26.401]  Not that I was afraid of a debate.
[03:55:26.961 --> 03:55:35.546]  But if I debated with a Greenpeace person, it was all about emotion and pointing fingers and not caring and all that rubbish.
[03:55:35.546 --> 03:55:40.768]  But if I debated with a scientist, then it was completely over people's heads.
[03:55:40.768 --> 03:55:51.094]  And one of the problems with this whole climate issue is people say, look, I'm lost here, I'm so confused, and I'm hearing this on one side and that on the other side, and I don't know enough.
[03:55:51.314 --> 03:55:54.057]  Well, bottom line, we've caught these people in fraud.
[03:55:54.057 --> 03:55:54.998]  It's over.
[03:55:54.998 --> 03:55:55.839]  Dismantle it.
[03:55:55.839 --> 03:55:58.281]  Don't let them pass it in Austin or anywhere else.
[03:55:58.281 --> 03:56:00.604]  This question about increased taxes on the middle class.
[03:56:00.604 --> 03:56:05.369]  We know $200 billion in the last 20 years has been spent in the U.S.
[03:56:05.369 --> 03:56:07.431]  alone pushing this propaganda.
[03:56:09.821 --> 03:56:19.326]  Anything that puts a tax on energy is going to be the perfect vehicle for a politician to grab taxes.
[03:56:19.326 --> 03:56:24.949]  I look at it, we talked earlier about the 3% carbon tax that was put on here in British Columbia.
[03:56:27.070 --> 03:56:44.576]  It is generating huge amounts of revenue because it isn't just on the energy, the production of the energy and distribution of it at your gas pump, where so much of it goes to taxes, but that then passes down into every single thing that's produced.
[03:56:44.576 --> 03:56:47.517]  It is completely pervasive throughout the whole
[03:56:48.945 --> 03:56:52.647]  And then they want to sell derivatives that are taxpayer-backed for the bankers.
[03:56:52.647 --> 03:56:53.748]  Last question here.
[03:56:53.748 --> 03:56:59.211]  I got a question here saying, isn't mild warming good for the earth?
[03:57:00.811 --> 03:57:02.092]  Most vicious attacks.
[03:57:02.092 --> 03:57:06.896]  When I wrote an article saying, look, there are some positive things about warming.
[03:57:06.896 --> 03:57:13.020]  And the idea that warming is only negative has been one of the biases that they've pushed.
[03:57:13.020 --> 03:57:15.302]  Cooling is the greater threat.
[03:57:15.302 --> 03:57:16.943]  And we've seen this historically.
[03:57:16.943 --> 03:57:20.266]  The Little Ice Age back in the 16th and 17th century.
[03:57:21.907 --> 03:57:23.187]  Dr. Tim Bull, we're out of time.
[03:57:23.187 --> 03:57:24.288]  Have a great weekend.
[03:57:24.288 --> 03:57:28.868]  Thank you for your tireless fight in the face of all their intimidation and threats.
[03:57:28.868 --> 03:57:30.789]  You've been proven right.
[03:57:30.789 --> 03:57:31.249]  God bless you.
[03:57:31.249 --> 03:57:32.069]  Have a great weekend.
[03:57:47.847 --> 03:57:48.327]  Take care.
[03:57:48.327 --> 03:57:50.590]  He writes for Canadian Free Press, another great publication.
[03:57:50.590 --> 03:57:52.031]  Just Google Dr. Tim Ball.
[03:57:52.031 --> 03:57:54.233]  Alright, close out of the show.
[03:57:54.233 --> 03:57:57.896]  Here is Kramer on Mad Money talking about the Illuminati.
[03:57:57.896 --> 03:57:58.317]  Here it is.
[03:58:01.202 --> 03:58:03.763]  This is AIG, AIG, Goldman, Goldman, and you know what?
[03:58:03.763 --> 03:58:08.704]  The Bavarian Illuminati, the Trilateral Commission, Goldman Sachs, and the Queen of England are not all bad.
[03:58:08.704 --> 03:58:09.024]  Wow.
[03:58:09.024 --> 03:58:11.085]  We've got to squeeze a couple of things in here.
[03:58:11.085 --> 03:58:11.265]  Sure.
[03:58:11.265 --> 03:58:14.606]  Alright, first of all, let's do this one.
[03:58:14.606 --> 03:58:15.006]  Apple.
[03:58:15.006 --> 03:58:16.226]  This iPad.
[03:58:16.226 --> 03:58:16.466]  Right.
[03:58:16.466 --> 03:58:16.986]  See that?
[03:58:16.986 --> 03:58:18.106]  Well, look, I've got to tell you.
[03:58:18.106 --> 03:58:19.647]  Apple, buy an iPad.
[03:58:19.647 --> 03:58:20.807]  That's good.
[03:58:20.807 --> 03:58:21.707]  You want an iPad?
[03:58:21.707 --> 03:58:23.468]  I can't wait 60 days.
[03:58:23.468 --> 03:58:24.068]  In our face.
[03:58:28.348 --> 03:58:29.608]  Throwing it in our face.
[03:58:29.608 --> 03:58:31.689]  Constant little comments like that.
[03:58:31.689 --> 03:58:32.990]  Back Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:58:32.990 --> 03:58:37.391]  Retransmission starts now with Dean Haglin, Bob Chapman, Big News Blitz.

[03:58:51.872 --> 03:58:54.893]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:58:54.893 --> 03:59:00.215]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:59:00.215 --> 03:59:02.276]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:59:02.276 --> 03:59:07.258]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:59:07.258 --> 03:59:08.459]  How much do you want?
[03:59:08.459 --> 03:59:09.579]  When do you want it?
[03:59:09.579 --> 03:59:11.460]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:59:11.460 --> 03:59:12.540]  When will you need it?
[03:59:12.540 --> 03:59:14.741]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:59:14.741 --> 03:59:16.082]  Will there be any food?
[03:59:16.082 --> 03:59:17.603]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:59:17.603 --> 03:59:18.643]  If there's a quarantine,
[03:59:18.803 --> 03:59:20.125]  And you can't feed yourself?
[03:59:20.125 --> 03:59:22.868]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:59:22.868 --> 03:59:26.453]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:59:26.453 --> 03:59:30.278]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:59:30.278 --> 03:59:31.499]  How much will you need?
[03:59:31.499 --> 03:59:32.400]  We don't know.
[03:59:32.400 --> 03:59:33.522]  How much do you want?
[03:59:33.522 --> 03:59:34.443]  All you can get.
[03:59:34.443 --> 03:59:35.244]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:59:35.524 --> 03:59:38.566]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
