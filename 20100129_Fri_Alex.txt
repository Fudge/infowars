[01:44.720 --> 01:49.120]  fly into the World Trade Center to blame it on Afghanistan as a pretext to
[01:49.120 --> 01:53.880]  launch a new war instead of a police state in the United States the criminal
[01:53.880 --> 02:00.680]  group within the Pentagon uses a drill to make norad stand down or six months
[02:00.680 --> 02:04.080]  later the exact same thing actually happened in reality so we'll talk about
[02:04.080 --> 02:08.400]  revelation of the method why the globalists do this and a lot more coming
[02:08.400 --> 02:13.960]  up in the second hour today we have the customary a visit with Bob Chapman on
[02:13.960 --> 02:19.560]  the economy and the banker gate situation that is taking place George
[02:19.560 --> 02:23.560]  Soros is running around trying to drive down the price of gold so he can buy it
[02:23.560 --> 02:28.400]  up of course we'll discuss that with Bob Chapman and then climatologist Tim
[02:28.400 --> 02:32.640]  Ball will be popping in for about 30 minutes in the last hour today and the
[02:32.640 --> 02:39.360]  broadcast of course will be jam-packed with key information and news Obama was
[02:39.360 --> 02:45.800]  laughed at during his state of the Union after calling climate gate climate
[02:45.800 --> 02:51.960]  change evidence overwhelming and he got laughed at and then the vice president
[02:51.960 --> 02:57.800]  Biden laughed behind him and so did Pelosi just it's all very funny a big
[02:57.800 --> 03:08.400]  joke on the people of the country and on the climate takeover situation I can't
[03:08.400 --> 03:12.080]  keep my eye on everything I tend to look out internationally and nationally
[03:12.080 --> 03:17.920]  with what's happening and I've known for a year but now it's crept up on us that
[03:17.920 --> 03:22.880]  Austin wants to have a complete and total takeover of every facet of our
[03:22.880 --> 03:30.960]  lives and that the federal government and UN are openly bragging that they are
[03:30.960 --> 03:38.000]  running this system and they brought in fed feds internationalist and others to
[03:38.000 --> 03:44.600]  run the operation in Austin Texas and Paul Watson's writing an article about
[03:44.600 --> 03:50.120]  that right now that'll be out before the show ends today they're set to vote on
[03:50.120 --> 03:55.240]  it the city council is saying next month and they admit this is the city
[03:55.240 --> 04:00.760]  council admitting along with Austin energy that it will cost two point six
[04:00.760 --> 04:06.040]  billion dollars now generally government underestimates what something will cost
[04:06.040 --> 04:12.080]  by about a third it'll probably end up being over six billion if they say it's
[04:12.080 --> 04:15.840]  a billion it's three or four billion if they say it's two billion it's six or
[04:15.840 --> 04:20.920]  seven billion they say it's 2.6 billion it'll probably be 10 billion by the time
[04:20.920 --> 04:29.480]  they're done a total takeover cutting off Austin energy scrapping cold fired
[04:29.480 --> 04:33.120]  plants this started over a decade ago where they would take city on plants and
[04:33.120 --> 04:37.720]  just shut them down Builderburg group is involved in this big time we covered
[04:37.720 --> 04:42.680]  that in 2008 with what happened in Turkey when Rick Perry went there we told
[04:42.680 --> 04:47.560]  you it was about shutting off the energy to Texas k-babies involved in that as
[04:47.560 --> 04:53.200]  well so that is coming up that's the tip of the iceberg you'll want to stay

[08:36.640 --> 08:44.360]  say let me get into a massive news blitz right now first off we have
[08:44.360 --> 08:51.240]  defeated Copenhagen even George Soros admitted at Davos yesterday that it is
[08:51.240 --> 08:55.920]  completely fallen apart and that they've got a regroup and try to bring in
[08:55.920 --> 09:00.520]  their global governance taxes he went on to say that the large central banks of
[09:00.520 --> 09:09.280]  the world will just increase their fraudulent power of s dr's where they
[09:09.280 --> 09:15.920]  just issue themselves massive amounts of funding and that they will simply go
[09:15.920 --> 09:22.320]  in and buy up and pay off the third world in the first world to adopt this
[09:22.320 --> 09:36.640]  system now Arnold Schwarzenegger in the last day of the conference last month
[09:36.640 --> 09:43.200]  as it fell apart he said that they were going to do an in run around the
[09:43.200 --> 09:48.560]  Congress around the house and Senate the Senate's refused to pass it they said
[09:48.560 --> 09:52.400]  they would do an in run around it and would go to the state and local level
[09:52.400 --> 09:58.000]  and implement this taxation system and the test city on the UN zone website and
[09:58.000 --> 10:03.360]  all the big phony environmentalists websites is Austin Texas and Los Angeles
[10:03.360 --> 10:07.880]  and San Francisco and several other cities where they believe they've got
[10:07.880 --> 10:13.360]  control Austin openly gets awards from leaders of foreign governments like
[10:13.360 --> 10:19.520]  Vicente Fox for not following laws for making Austin a sanctuary city it is
[10:19.520 --> 10:24.240]  a lawless city that does whatever it wants and is fully controlled by
[10:24.240 --> 10:30.880]  offshore corporations it is involved in violations of state law the city cannot
[10:30.880 --> 10:35.680]  just do whatever it wants in violation of state law they can't shut down gun
[10:35.680 --> 10:40.840]  shows without a law because they feel like it they can't put a 2.6 billion
[10:40.840 --> 10:47.960]  dollar tax and that's Austin clean energy and security act that's what they
[10:47.960 --> 10:53.560]  themselves are saying I got up at 5 30 this morning turned on news radio 590
[10:53.560 --> 10:57.800]  and heard Austin energy itself telling us how great this was going to be and
[10:57.800 --> 11:02.640]  telling us that it was going to create jobs really Spain did this and for
[11:02.640 --> 11:09.760]  every green job they created they lost 2.2 jobs and each job created cost
[11:09.760 --> 11:15.760]  $700,000 even though the average person in Spain with a green job was paid the
[11:15.760 --> 11:24.400]  equivalent of $51,000 why not just give people $700,000 no the 700,000 is paid
[11:24.400 --> 11:30.080]  into select globalist so-called green energy companies that Pichari the head
[11:30.080 --> 11:34.640]  of the IPCC that Barack Obama the president that the former vice president
[11:34.640 --> 11:41.280]  Al Gore the Rothschilds they're all over the news making taxpayer money out of
[11:41.280 --> 11:47.840]  these scams they've got 20 year old technology that's cost over a billion
[11:47.840 --> 11:55.560]  dollars outside Austin and Bastrop that produces less power from solar than one
[11:55.560 --> 12:00.760]  small cold fired plant they shut down known as the Holly Street plant in
[12:00.760 --> 12:09.760]  downtown Austin on the river now that's how scams work $700,000 goes to the
[12:09.760 --> 12:16.480]  corrupt corporations for every stinking job they create here's news radio 590
[12:16.480 --> 12:21.320]  reporting Austin's carbon reduction plan more than cap and trade bill
[12:21.320 --> 12:27.720]  proposes a higher level immediately than even what the treaty calls for at least
[12:27.720 --> 12:33.760]  a 30% cut in our quote carbon dioxide output Austin energies carbon reduction
[12:33.760 --> 12:39.160]  plan calls for Austin CO2 emissions to be reduced by a greater amount than what
[12:39.160 --> 12:44.720]  the Austin Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 called for they're going even
[12:44.720 --> 12:49.120]  further than what the UN calls for even further than what Austin said it would do
[12:49.120 --> 12:53.320]  last year that way they know people will fight them and they'll say okay we'll
[12:53.320 --> 12:59.520]  just go with what we wanted last year a $1.5 billion tax also known as the cap
[12:59.520 --> 13:03.480]  and trade bill the act was passed by the US House representatives in June but not
[13:03.480 --> 13:08.360]  the Senate and calls for emissions to be reduced by 17% it's actually about 30 by
[13:08.360 --> 13:13.880]  2020 compared to the record recorded levels of 2005 Austin Energy head
[13:13.880 --> 13:20.040]  Roger Duncan says the local utility plan calls for a 20% reduction to see the
[13:20.040 --> 13:24.440]  presentation Duncan presented to the Austin City Council click here Duncan
[13:24.440 --> 13:29.160]  says putting the plan in place would potentially cost the city around 2.6
[13:29.160 --> 13:35.280]  billion just to launch it not just your cost this is a taxing grid that's just
[13:35.280 --> 13:40.280]  the cost of this he says Austin Energy consumers would expect to see slight
[13:40.280 --> 13:46.160]  rate increases in three years oh yes slight natural gas is absolutely cheap
[13:46.160 --> 13:52.720]  right now what is it $3 per British cubic thousand feet or whatever it was
[13:52.720 --> 13:59.040]  15 bucks a year ago but gas prices are more in this town it's totally clean
[13:59.040 --> 14:04.680]  burning but the environmentalist and I heard him on newscast last night saying
[14:04.680 --> 14:10.160]  they've got to get rid of gas use in Austin by taxing you when you use natural
[14:10.160 --> 14:16.120]  gas here we are in Texas enough natural gas to run the entire planet oh yes
[14:16.120 --> 14:20.880]  the US producing more than any other country passing Russia last year but we
[14:20.880 --> 14:30.040]  have to have a tax on it you can't have that cheap energy no no no no no Duncan
[14:30.040 --> 14:33.680]  says putting the plan in place could potentially cost the city around 2.6
[14:33.680 --> 14:41.400]  billion just to put in the ugly wind farms just to put the stinking wind
[14:41.400 --> 14:47.040]  farms in and then each wind farm puts out such a small amount of power that you
[14:47.040 --> 14:53.080]  end up losing most of the power in the transmission of it to the cities because
[14:53.080 --> 14:59.200]  they want to build the things a hundred miles from here it turns out in the
[14:59.200 --> 15:03.240]  studies it use takes more energy than you end up saving to build the stinking
[15:03.240 --> 15:09.320]  things and I've asked Watson to dig up that statesman article from six months
[15:09.320 --> 15:12.760]  ago where they admit the Pentagon's involved in Austin and they're sending
[15:12.760 --> 15:17.840]  former black op commanders and kernels it listed their names in the paper to run
[15:17.840 --> 15:22.840]  things in Austin and they're running it yes we're all going into serfdom here in
[15:22.840 --> 15:29.400]  Austin total slavery to these people now remember I told you they can't get the
[15:29.400 --> 15:34.640]  Congress to pass it so they're going to take over your cities they come in with
[15:34.640 --> 15:37.560]  unlimited foreign bank money that they've looted and stolen from the
[15:37.560 --> 15:41.800]  taxpayers they shut off your energy and then make you buy their overpriced
[15:41.800 --> 15:47.560]  energy and make money putting the systems in states to lead carbon markets
[15:47.560 --> 15:51.480]  its federal plan stalls I just thought I'd pull that up from January 7th from
[15:51.480 --> 15:56.680]  Bloomberg it's not just Alex Jones saying it it's their official battle plan
[15:56.680 --> 16:03.560]  and Lee laughing well the horrid mayor we have says that next month they're
[16:03.560 --> 16:09.200]  going to pass this they're gonna have a stage town hall everyone needs to get to
[16:09.200 --> 16:15.200]  that town hall we need to get a massive protest set up now everyone needs to go
[16:15.200 --> 16:19.040]  down there everyone needs to be there now what the city will do is they'll give
[16:19.040 --> 16:23.120]  permits to their pets you don't need permits to protest people have won
[16:23.120 --> 16:27.560]  lawsuits over and over again in Austin I don't get permits to protest in Austin
[16:27.560 --> 16:31.280]  the only place you have to get it is for the time on the steps of the Capitol if
[16:31.280 --> 16:37.320]  you want their broadcast system their radio system their PA system you don't
[16:37.320 --> 16:40.720]  have to get one to be out on the front of the Capitol what they'll do is they'll
[16:40.720 --> 16:45.120]  have all their NGO pets out there and then when the real Americans show up
[16:45.120 --> 16:48.920]  they'll run in and cause a fracas and then say that you're not allowed to be
[16:48.920 --> 16:53.880]  there protesting that's how they run their operations now we discovered but
[16:53.880 --> 16:57.480]  again we need people all over the country to go to this yet unannounced
[16:57.480 --> 17:02.280]  meeting time next month in their fake town hall now we went and shot down the
[17:02.280 --> 17:08.000]  Patriot Act in Austin and we're gonna do the same thing this time ladies and
[17:08.000 --> 17:15.720]  gentlemen this is a major battle line a front line fight ladies and gentlemen a
[17:15.720 --> 17:24.760]  front line fight against the New World Order coming up states to lead carbon
[17:24.760 --> 17:31.720]  markets as federal plan stalls state governments across the nation are
[17:31.720 --> 17:36.440]  likely to dominate the emerging US carbon market in 2010 I'm at doubts that
[17:36.440 --> 17:39.880]  Congress will pass an emissions trading law this year while capitrate
[17:39.880 --> 17:45.040]  legislation which create carbon dioxide permits oh you get permits state local
[17:45.040 --> 17:48.040]  federal international all these new taxing authorities that companies
[17:48.040 --> 17:53.600]  could buy and sell is stalled the US Senate a group of northeastern states
[17:53.600 --> 17:57.280]  already has a carbon market in two more regional programs in the Midwest and
[17:57.280 --> 18:02.040]  West plan to follow suit Austin Texas then they'll take all the derivatives
[18:02.040 --> 18:06.920]  money they make scam everybody use that to buy up more land and then when they
[18:06.920 --> 18:11.560]  pop that bubble they'll have you bail them out again the Austin is run by a
[18:11.560 --> 18:16.160]  group of criminals that under SOS stole tens of thousands of acres set up was
[18:16.160 --> 18:19.600]  for environmental biospheres then turned around and sold to themselves for
[18:19.600 --> 18:23.240]  pennies on the dollar built hotels apartments everything else I mean it is
[18:23.240 --> 18:28.520]  they own their own banks it's just a giant swindle and they love it just like

[24:07.240 --> 24:14.480]  it's simple international banks come in take over your country buy off your
[24:14.480 --> 24:19.920]  Congress your parliaments your state legislatures have massive taxes paid to
[24:19.920 --> 24:26.280]  them then they take that money and they come in and buy off your legislatures
[24:26.280 --> 24:31.280]  further have them enact laws to put toll roads on all your major roads have
[24:31.280 --> 24:36.240]  private companies the banks finance and own and control get the money from the
[24:36.240 --> 24:42.240]  toll roads they then take that money buy off more existing roads they have the
[24:42.240 --> 24:47.160]  states and the feds build new roads with taxpayer money which are then given to
[24:47.160 --> 24:51.920]  them they get the profit from that we've been fighting the North American Union
[24:51.920 --> 24:58.760]  the NAFTA superhighways the trans-Texas corridor they come in they shut down your
[24:58.760 --> 25:04.800]  plants shut down your coal plants make you take overpriced wind power systems
[25:04.800 --> 25:09.680]  overpriced solar powered systems the federal government taxes you sends back
[25:09.680 --> 25:14.000]  about 30 cents on the dollar to the state saying you must spend this money on
[25:14.000 --> 25:18.720]  quote green renewable energy they tell you what companies you must buy it from
[25:18.720 --> 25:24.240]  Al Gore George Soros Rockefeller Rothschild Pechari controlled and
[25:24.240 --> 25:29.360]  that's just how the scam works an organized economy by them for their
[25:29.360 --> 25:35.200]  profit and for their control and so yes we shot down a lot of the Copenhagen
[25:35.200 --> 25:39.200]  operation but they're not stopping and we've got to go to every city council
[25:39.200 --> 25:42.480]  you've got to go to the citizens communications the county commissioners
[25:42.480 --> 25:47.560]  your legislatures and say no you can't do this here's the Austin American
[25:47.560 --> 25:52.600]  statesman energy plan comes to city council as legislature plans review
[25:52.600 --> 25:58.400]  proposal to add more renewable energy to be presented and then you read it
[25:58.400 --> 26:01.640]  sounds reasonable oh more renewable energy all it is is shutting down the
[26:01.640 --> 26:07.400]  power plants as they've said in their actual press releases 2.6 billion in
[26:07.400 --> 26:14.000]  Austin alone just to put in the systems and then all the new taxes and costs
[26:14.000 --> 26:21.240]  robbing you completely criminal as the shops and stores and factories and
[26:21.240 --> 26:27.680]  businesses shut down everywhere as Detroit implodes as the depression
[26:27.680 --> 26:35.600]  accelerates this is their answer take over the states take over the cities it
[26:35.600 --> 26:45.920]  is outrageously criminal what is going on I want to play a clip now of Obama
[26:45.920 --> 26:50.440]  being laughed at it's a brief clip and the Republicans and some of the
[26:50.440 --> 26:55.320]  Democrats laugh at him when he says the science is settled and that we know
[26:55.320 --> 27:05.120]  man-made global warming is real my son plays a little history online game
[27:05.120 --> 27:09.960]  called brain pop and in there they say it's wrong to hunt they say it's wrong
[27:09.960 --> 27:15.480]  to collect butterflies that the polar bears are dying it's literally a bunch
[27:15.480 --> 27:20.720]  of deception and this is what's in the textbooks this is everywhere just 24
[27:20.720 --> 27:28.080]  seven brainwashing as the system says that no one questions it it's an
[27:28.080 --> 27:33.840]  absolute scientific fact as in every case the UN has been caught with big
[27:33.840 --> 27:37.440]  corporations of the oil companies who want this new taxing system they want
[27:37.440 --> 27:41.520]  to charge you more for fuel because they themselves are owned by the big banks
[27:41.520 --> 27:46.840]  that get the tax money as it's proven that it's all a premeditated fraud
[27:46.840 --> 27:51.240]  here is Obama from a state of the Union I know that there are those who
[27:51.240 --> 27:58.640]  disagree with the overwhelming scientific evidence on climate change but
[27:58.640 --> 28:11.200]  there he is being laughed at and then Pelosi and Biden behind him left to so
[28:11.200 --> 28:14.800]  that viewers just think it's all a joke about something you know they just laugh
[28:14.800 --> 28:19.920]  along with him but here's the deal they can't pass it to the Senate they
[28:19.920 --> 28:23.720]  couldn't pass it internationally by treaty so he's just ordered the EPA
[28:23.720 --> 28:28.560]  criminally to declare carbon dioxide that plants breathe that plants live off
[28:28.560 --> 28:33.280]  of that humans exhale as a toxic waste and they're going to come into Austin
[28:33.280 --> 28:37.800]  and shut down your jobs and shut down and this is happening all over the
[28:37.800 --> 28:46.640]  country it is a criminal fraud these people are criminals there's open
[28:46.640 --> 28:51.480]  discussions of indicting Geithner open discussions of indictments of Pichari
[28:51.480 --> 28:57.000]  open discussion people know it's criminal I'm not the only one pointing out
[28:57.000 --> 29:01.680]  this is criminal it came out in a bunch of mainstream papers that the main
[29:01.680 --> 29:09.680]  climate UN facility at East Anglia London East Anglia England is in deep
[29:09.680 --> 29:14.160]  trouble and criminally block the release of their files this is a criminal
[29:14.160 --> 29:18.920]  enterprise to shut down and take control of your resources and to decide who can
[29:18.920 --> 29:24.960]  have a business and who has what taxes put on a total takeover and they're not
[29:24.960 --> 29:30.680]  stopping we're having victories but they're still moving forward and if we

[38:33.800 --> 38:41.900]  now blitz through the news finishing up this hour with the discussion we've been
[38:41.900 --> 38:45.960]  having about the international crime syndicate the banks setting up neo
[38:45.960 --> 38:50.360]  feudalism literally deciding who can have a business who can a whole new grid
[38:50.360 --> 38:55.720]  of taxes and bureaucrats and inspectors and control and how we're fighting it
[38:55.720 --> 39:03.440]  meanwhile they have this newest ridiculous propaganda I told you a few
[39:03.440 --> 39:07.840]  months ago that Obama's approval rating was plunging and freefall and that as
[39:07.840 --> 39:13.280]  soon as they reintroduced more fake bin Laden videos and audios and some fake
[39:13.280 --> 39:19.080]  staged terror attacks that that would herald the preparation for Obama to
[39:19.080 --> 39:23.000]  start mimicking Bush with the police state and he's been continuing the
[39:23.000 --> 39:28.360]  secret arrest the torture that are in dishing expanding the wars right on time
[39:28.360 --> 39:34.680]  the staged underwear bombing clearly staged proven and triplicate right on
[39:34.680 --> 39:40.920]  time the naked body scanners right on time Obama says Al Qaeda is gonna hit us
[39:40.920 --> 39:43.920]  it's gonna be bigger than 9-11 the Pentagon says we'll have to have martial
[39:43.920 --> 39:49.200]  law for your safety then they start putting out fake bin Laden tapes every
[39:49.200 --> 39:55.360]  week you put out one two weeks ago they put out a new one yesterday and this is
[39:55.360 --> 40:00.640]  so asinine the Associated Press runs the deceptive headline bin Laden blasts
[40:00.640 --> 40:09.960]  us for climate change and the last line of this one two three four five six seven
[40:09.960 --> 40:17.520]  eight paragraph article no journalistic integrity total fraud a high school
[40:17.520 --> 40:23.840]  newspaper wouldn't allow this but the AP does it the new message whose
[40:23.840 --> 40:29.600]  authenticity could not immediately be confirmed comes after a bin Laden tape
[40:29.600 --> 40:33.720]  or released last week which they said was unconfirmed now they just slip in an
[40:33.720 --> 40:37.400]  old they don't say it was confirmed they just say another bin Laden tape so
[40:37.400 --> 40:44.240]  that's deceptive right there this is the worst journalism you can imagine the
[40:44.240 --> 40:47.680]  new message whose authenticity could not immediately be confirmed comes after
[40:47.680 --> 40:51.680]  bin Laden tape released last week in which he endorsed a failed attempt to
[40:51.680 --> 40:57.400]  blow up an American airline on Christmas Day they released these on message
[40:57.400 --> 41:03.000]  boards and every time linguist in major universities listen to the recordings
[41:03.000 --> 41:07.200]  they've said over and over again it isn't the same dialect it isn't been
[41:07.200 --> 41:12.400]  laden they can take real audio video tapes of him they've created a voice
[41:12.400 --> 41:18.160]  print identification key it's a hundred percent and they test the new tapes
[41:18.160 --> 41:24.360]  against the voice print it won't unlock the voice key but it's worse linguist
[41:24.360 --> 41:28.560]  listen and over and over again it's every tape is a different voice a
[41:28.560 --> 41:33.080]  different dialect some they say or someone from Saudi Arabia someone from
[41:33.080 --> 41:38.360]  Italy someone from Central Europe someone from North America US or Canada
[41:38.360 --> 41:48.360]  faking it isn't even a real Arab it isn't even the same dialect I mean like
[41:48.360 --> 41:52.480]  if somebody put out a tape and people that know how to listen to it in English
[41:52.480 --> 42:00.120]  if they put out a fake Alex Jones tape and on the the tape it was I am Alex
[42:00.120 --> 42:06.600]  Jones I am going to get you I am going to carry out attacks and then they put
[42:06.600 --> 42:10.760]  it out and people that are from Texas linguists people to understand dialect
[42:10.760 --> 42:14.280]  listen to it and they go well that isn't even someone from the Middle East that
[42:14.280 --> 42:19.240]  that's this is completely fake that's how dumb they think you are people that
[42:19.240 --> 42:24.760]  know the dialect and know bin Laden's speech inflections listen to it and it
[42:24.760 --> 42:35.080]  isn't even close and they admit it's fake I mean this is so outrageous so
[42:35.080 --> 42:42.600]  unbelievably ridiculous on its face but in the first seven paragraphs it's been
[42:42.600 --> 42:52.320]  laden's gonna get us and been laden's upset about the evil carbon dioxide and
[42:52.320 --> 42:58.760]  he's gonna attack us because we won't go along with the carbon tax even terrorists
[42:58.760 --> 43:04.760]  know the right thing to do this admitted CI asset dead for at least eight
[43:04.760 --> 43:10.320]  years according to mainstream media reports totally I mean it is a joke of
[43:10.320 --> 43:22.880]  jokes of jokes bin Laden blast u.s. for climate change al Qaeda leader Osama
[43:22.880 --> 43:27.800]  bin Laden has called for the world to boycott American goods and the u.s.
[43:27.800 --> 43:31.480]  dollar blaming the United States and other industrialized countries for
[43:31.480 --> 43:39.480]  global warming according to a new audio tape released Friday oh my gosh
[43:39.480 --> 43:44.120]  in the tape broadcast in part on Al Jazeera television bin Laden warned of
[43:44.120 --> 43:47.480]  the dangers of climate change and says that the way to stop it is to bring the
[43:47.480 --> 43:52.400]  wheels of American economy to all which is what the climate legislation would do
[43:52.400 --> 43:56.040]  which is what the banks want the UN wants more a strong ones he blame
[43:56.040 --> 43:59.880]  Western industrialized nations for hunger deforestation and floods across the
[43:59.880 --> 44:04.400]  globe yeah they're they're now seeing the earthquake not just Danny Glover but
[44:04.400 --> 44:11.000]  the UN is saying the earthquake was caused by I mean no one in any scientific
[44:11.000 --> 44:14.680]  field says that the atmosphere causes earthquakes they don't care they're
[44:14.680 --> 44:18.440]  teaching it to school kids right now I've got confirmed reports we covered
[44:18.440 --> 44:24.880]  yesterday and the day before where they're now teaching that the earthquake
[44:24.880 --> 44:30.360]  happened because you won't pay taxes to George Soros I mean this is a joke of a
[44:30.360 --> 44:35.520]  joke of a fraud I mean it's so it's like them teaching school kids that
[44:35.520 --> 44:39.160]  polar bears can't swim and are all dying when their numbers are exploding I
[44:39.160 --> 44:44.360]  mean it's just it's a fact their numbers are exploding but they think you're so
[44:44.360 --> 44:56.200]  stupid they think you're dumber than dirt they think you are complete morons
[44:56.200 --> 45:01.120]  why not almost everybody mark dice talk to in San Diego read a petition to ban
[45:01.120 --> 45:05.320]  free speech in the First Amendment and and and he said shut up everyone that
[45:05.320 --> 45:10.440]  criticizes Obama it was clear and they said yes sir and let's shut down your
[45:10.440 --> 45:17.960]  jobs oh yes and tax me tax me more I'm an idiot we've got to reach out to these
[45:17.960 --> 45:22.440]  idiots these idiot fake right-wingers that think there are all these real
[45:22.440 --> 45:27.000]  terrorists that want to attack us these idiot leftists that think in Austin the
[45:27.000 --> 45:31.120]  city council stealing property and then openly giving it to former mayors I mean
[45:31.120 --> 45:35.400]  it's just lawless criminality out in the open what do you expect it's gonna happen
[45:35.400 --> 45:44.200]  when you let these kind of things go on what do you expect people grow up we've
[45:44.200 --> 45:47.880]  got so many new listeners I'm talking to the new people listening that think this
[45:47.880 --> 45:55.760]  shows a joke and at the end they say the whole time it's really been lauding
[45:55.760 --> 45:59.440]  with no attribution where it came from they're just training you and then they
[45:59.440 --> 46:05.760]  say oh we have no idea this is even real I mean I could literally read Arabic in
[46:05.760 --> 46:10.400]  some fake message and put it out but I guarantee you that they would come arrest
[46:10.400 --> 46:15.240]  me but I could do it just to illustrate they find some law like the guy five
[46:15.240 --> 46:18.680]  years ago that did the fake beheading in his garage in San Francisco to illustrate
[46:18.680 --> 46:24.000]  how stupid it is the media ran with that oh look a new beheading
[46:28.880 --> 46:35.600]  there is no end to it ten years ago they didn't have AP reports like this
[46:35.600 --> 46:43.480]  again journalism in high school is better than this I mean I could literally
[46:43.480 --> 46:52.480]  sit here and go this is Uthama bin Laden I am speaking to you in English do
[46:52.480 --> 47:00.880]  whatever Ben Bernanke says or I will send space aliens to get you I mean is
[47:00.880 --> 47:06.240]  there nothing people won't buy is there nothing
[47:07.640 --> 47:12.160]  okay getting into the banking scam you know the bad news you know that Ben
[47:12.160 --> 47:21.240]  Bernanke was reconfirmed to the chairmanship of the Federal Reserve
[47:21.240 --> 47:24.760]  Chucky Schumer said because he did such a great job and so he can save our
[47:24.760 --> 47:31.520]  economy oh yes after they terrorized the public in October of 2008 saying give us
[47:31.520 --> 47:36.320]  all these new funds give us unlimited trillions or there'll be a depression and
[47:36.320 --> 47:40.800]  then the economy plunged that's financial terrorism totally illegal
[47:40.800 --> 47:46.520]  insider trading total manipulation of markets out in the open but that's okay
[47:46.520 --> 47:50.080]  because I don't want him to just be shunned and and just be thrown on the
[47:50.080 --> 47:54.480]  bus we want his bosses to go to prison and Geithner is in trouble and they
[47:54.480 --> 47:58.000]  there are calls for him to resign it will only get worse as the economy gets
[47:58.000 --> 48:02.160]  worse meanwhile Paulson in testimony we've got this coming up later in the
[48:02.160 --> 48:07.880]  broadcast Paulson in testimony I see you guys at video Paulson you have it
[48:07.880 --> 48:15.000]  where where he said the Russians were planning do you have the Paulson video I
[48:15.000 --> 48:18.800]  sent you where they said that the Russians were planning to drive down our
[48:18.800 --> 48:22.680]  economy and that's why they had to have the banker bailout it was the evil
[48:22.680 --> 48:27.280]  Russians it it wasn't the bankers it wasn't JP Morgan it wasn't Goldman
[48:27.280 --> 48:32.520]  Sachs if you don't have that I sent you I sent you the article in the video okay
[48:32.520 --> 48:39.720]  good because I want to play that later but here is the big news here is the
[48:39.720 --> 48:49.760]  big story this is on prisonplanet.com by Paul Joseph Watson go there now get
[48:49.760 --> 48:56.080]  this article get it out to everyone because what does New York mayor Bloomberg
[48:56.080 --> 49:02.160]  have to say headline Bloomberg there may be a secret banking cabal that does
[49:02.160 --> 49:08.880]  run the world after all he's now given an interview to his own publication
[49:08.880 --> 49:13.560]  Bloomberg see we have forced them to admit all this is real and now he's
[49:13.560 --> 49:16.680]  getting ready to run for president he understands people know the real enemy
[49:16.680 --> 49:21.360]  as the banks and so Bloomberg funded by these people is gonna play games like
[49:21.360 --> 49:27.000]  Glenn Beck and Governor Perry and claim he's a patriot hey at least he's
[49:27.000 --> 49:31.160]  admitting it that goes a long way to identifying the real government because
[49:31.160 --> 49:34.840]  they may fool us another time with Bloomberg coming up they know people
[49:34.840 --> 49:38.600]  don't want Republicans or Democrats he may run for president as an independent
[49:38.600 --> 49:43.640]  because now it will be openly discussed that the real government is the banks
[49:43.640 --> 49:47.800]  Bloomberg may be a secret banking cabal does run the world after all and
[49:47.800 --> 49:50.720]  another measure of how with the establishment labels conspiracy theory
[49:50.720 --> 49:54.280]  is quickly becoming mainstream Bloomberg news carries a story today
[49:54.280 --> 50:00.080]  acknowledging that those derided as crazy for warning that the world is run by
[50:00.080 --> 50:04.720]  a secret banking cabal have largely been proven right in the light of the AIG
[50:04.720 --> 50:08.000]  cover-up bombing how many leaders of the Republican Democratic Party in
[50:08.000 --> 50:13.280]  Congress countless have said the banks run America I mean that they are the
[50:13.280 --> 50:17.080]  economy they're stealing everything their parasites it's like a 10-pound dog
[50:17.080 --> 50:22.560]  dragging a 30-pound tick around but the tick owns the television in the media
[50:22.560 --> 50:26.720]  and tells you how much you need him the idea of a seat this is this is a quote
[50:26.720 --> 50:31.680]  from Bloomberg the idea of a secret banking cabal that controls the country
[50:31.680 --> 50:37.040]  and global economy are given among conspiracy theories who stockpile ammo
[50:37.040 --> 50:40.880]  bottle water and peanut butter after this week's congressional hearing into
[50:40.880 --> 50:44.480]  the bailout of America International grouping you have to wonder if these
[50:44.480 --> 50:51.760]  folks are crazy after all that's from Bloomberg from Bloomberg publication
[50:51.760 --> 50:57.280]  what do you mean it's not secret they're openly announcing world government the

[54:26.440 --> 54:33.680]  bankers it's the money changers it's the new world order it's the system and we
[54:33.680 --> 54:40.760]  can all agree with this mannelling this parasite system that has bought off
[54:40.760 --> 54:46.640]  governments and given itself the power to create unlimited fiat currency and
[54:46.640 --> 54:53.080]  credit to take over our society they've already created thousands and thousands
[54:53.080 --> 54:57.080]  of times more money than there is assets in the world that's conservative
[54:57.080 --> 55:04.960]  hundreds of times the total GDP and complete assets some estimates are in
[55:04.960 --> 55:10.480]  the thousands and so now they want to use fake environmentalism to take over
[55:10.480 --> 55:14.760]  your life now they want to use that to shut down everything to bankrupt you so
[55:14.760 --> 55:19.680]  they can have an organized neo feudalistic society and I wanted to
[55:19.680 --> 55:24.240]  play this clip of Dick Morris in front of Sean Hannity who's done more than
[55:24.240 --> 55:30.720]  anybody in fake right-wing conservative media to say there's no such thing as
[55:30.720 --> 55:34.320]  a new world order global government and that the Federal Reserve isn't private
[55:34.320 --> 55:41.440]  and boy he turned red when Dick Morris told the truth play that clip there is
[55:41.440 --> 55:45.160]  a big thing that's going to happen in London at this G20 and then they're
[55:45.160 --> 55:48.360]  hiding it they camouflaging it they're not talking about it
[55:48.360 --> 55:54.000]  coordination of international regulation what they are going to do is to put our
[55:54.000 --> 55:59.600]  Fed and our SEC under the control in effect of the IMF oh come on they'll
[55:59.600 --> 56:03.160]  believe they'll do this that's what was in the draft agenda they call it
[56:03.160 --> 56:07.960]  coordination of regulation what it really is is putting the American economy
[56:07.960 --> 56:12.400]  under international regulation yeah and those people who have been yelling oh
[56:12.400 --> 56:16.120]  the UN's gonna take over global conspiracy theory they consider it they've
[56:16.120 --> 56:20.560]  been crazy but now they're right yeah well when guidance happening when God
[56:20.560 --> 56:24.160]  Geithner said it would be open to the idea of a global currency last second
[56:24.160 --> 56:29.240]  yeah those conspiracy people had said and suggested that for years you're not
[56:29.240 --> 56:34.760]  wrong and you know it's what they always do with these conferences is they have
[56:34.760 --> 56:38.520]  this the center show is here and the side show they don't want you to pay
[56:38.520 --> 56:42.640]  attention to the center show is the size of the stimulus package yeah the real
[56:42.640 --> 56:47.440]  show is international regulation of the financial institutions which is gonna
[56:47.440 --> 56:51.960]  happen under the IMF control and remember the IMF is run by Europeans the
[56:51.960 --> 56:57.360]  world banked by Americans let me ask you this because that we got the G20 summit
[56:57.360 --> 57:00.720]  this week and by the end of the week folks you're gonna see the police and
[57:00.720 --> 57:05.760]  the clubbings and the beatings and the tear gas is all coming as it already
[57:05.760 --> 57:10.000]  started all right what his polls are dropping somewhat dramatically we touched
[57:10.000 --> 57:14.040]  on a little bit last week so politically as we look as we begin the
[57:14.040 --> 57:20.080]  broader battle budget I played that clip because I wanted to just remind you
[57:20.080 --> 57:24.920]  all these years while they were building the global government setting up the
[57:24.920 --> 57:28.960]  system bankrupting the states overrunning the nation with illegals to
[57:28.960 --> 57:32.280]  further bankrupt it and create a voting block they can use to vote for
[57:32.280 --> 57:40.440]  unconstitutional measures they were there stalling you stalling me saying it
[57:40.440 --> 57:43.520]  doesn't exist doesn't exist this is their favorite tactic remember three years
[57:43.520 --> 57:47.880]  ago when I had the heir to the Rothschild fortune on he was promoting a book we
[57:47.880 --> 57:53.000]  called up got their publisher to get him on remember and he said there's no plan
[57:53.000 --> 57:58.240]  for a tax there's no such thing as cap and trade he owned the main bank two
[57:58.240 --> 58:02.680]  years before that setting it up he knew all about it but he had such contempt
[58:02.680 --> 58:07.560]  and hatred for you that David Rothschild who's now on television calling for
[58:07.560 --> 58:14.520]  global governance and global taxes told you it didn't exist now that they were
[58:14.520 --> 58:20.720]  given the green light to go completely public he comes right out in the open
[58:20.720 --> 58:26.560]  and calls for global governance on Bloomberg a month ago at Copenhagen
[58:26.560 --> 58:30.800]  that's the same thing Sean Hannity Limbaugh all of them there's no new
[58:30.800 --> 58:34.360]  world order it doesn't exist I heard Beck eight years ago saying that now they
[58:34.360 --> 58:38.440]  admit it exists but don't worry the Republicans will save you from it no

[1:01:20.440 --> 1:01:25.000]  banking cabal does run the world after all and fox news saying it is a secret
[1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:29.440]  global banking cabal and CNN saying well yeah there's a global government
[1:01:29.440 --> 1:01:36.520]  banking cabal but they want to take care of you they want to they want to help
[1:01:36.520 --> 1:01:43.720]  you they know what they're doing and so that's the spin all these years they
[1:01:43.720 --> 1:01:50.600]  denied it all these years they said it didn't exist and now they just come out
[1:01:50.600 --> 1:01:56.960]  and say you know what it's a good thing and we need it and when they tell you
[1:01:56.960 --> 1:02:00.960]  it's going to give you jobs shutting down industry it's the opposite just like
[1:02:00.960 --> 1:02:06.080]  their car bailout paid to have GM move offshore they are globalist they are
[1:02:06.080 --> 1:02:10.600]  monopoly men they want to destroy the economy they want to bankrupt the dollar
[1:02:10.600 --> 1:02:14.720]  Ron Paul yesterday in an article Steve Watson wrote from the video of him on
[1:02:14.720 --> 1:02:22.400]  Cavuto laid it out it's premeditated they are wreckers what were wreckers well
[1:02:22.400 --> 1:02:26.000]  all over the world in an ancient times and even into the last 200 years in
[1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:30.720]  England they had city towns on dangerous shoals in England and France that
[1:02:30.720 --> 1:02:37.200]  would put up fake lighthouses at night to bring ships in on the rocks and under
[1:02:37.200 --> 1:02:41.280]  salvage laws they were allowed to then come out a lot of times not even save
[1:02:41.280 --> 1:02:47.280]  the drowning people and then they would come out and salvage the ships goods and
[1:02:47.280 --> 1:02:51.560]  that's what they are they are wreckers they are feudal lords they want you
[1:02:51.560 --> 1:02:56.720]  bankrupted so they can control your life they say this is what they want they say
[1:02:56.720 --> 1:03:01.720]  the carbon tax it's to destroy the industrialized society they admit they're
[1:03:01.720 --> 1:03:06.280]  your enemy in their own publications then they arrogantly deny it when they're
[1:03:06.280 --> 1:03:10.080]  on television even when you have their own quotes and video clips
[1:03:10.080 --> 1:03:15.360]  meanwhile Paulson got grilled as you know in the last two days in Congress now
[1:03:15.360 --> 1:03:19.080]  he has his own conspiracy theory which the Russians have denied and which the
[1:03:19.080 --> 1:03:23.360]  White House is not confirming Paulson says Russia urged China to dump fanny
[1:03:23.360 --> 1:03:29.480]  Freddy bonds he says when he was in China during the Olympics that he heard
[1:03:29.480 --> 1:03:34.680]  there was a Russian plan really we have the Goldman Sachs documents that you
[1:03:34.680 --> 1:03:40.240]  headed up that McClatchy newspapers in a five-part series on where Goldman Sachs
[1:03:40.240 --> 1:03:44.520]  three years before that three years before 2008 was planning to create a
[1:03:44.520 --> 1:03:48.520]  housing bubble tell everybody to buy it and then secretly betting against it to
[1:03:48.520 --> 1:03:54.600]  quote destroy their competition to make hundreds of billions I mean isn't isn't
[1:03:54.600 --> 1:04:00.520]  that funny isn't that interesting I mean we know who came out on October 2008
[1:04:00.520 --> 1:04:04.240]  said the economy's dead it's all over oh my god run for the hills it was the
[1:04:04.240 --> 1:04:08.600]  bankers it was Bernanke it was Paulson it was Geithner to drive down the market
[1:04:08.600 --> 1:04:13.200]  further so when they got their bailout money they could buy it up and then he
[1:04:13.200 --> 1:04:20.920]  comes out and blames the Russians the Russians own market plunged by over 60
[1:04:20.920 --> 1:04:26.360]  percent during the 888 war and singing in told you that Russia attacked Georgia a
[1:04:26.360 --> 1:04:34.560]  complete fraud on its face but despite roll at AIG criminal bailout Senate

[1:05:07.120 --> 1:05:11.160]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[1:05:11.160 --> 1:05:15.040]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[1:05:15.040 --> 1:05:19.080]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[1:05:19.080 --> 1:05:23.640]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[1:05:23.640 --> 1:05:27.680]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[1:05:27.680 --> 1:05:31.480]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[1:05:31.480 --> 1:05:35.080]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[1:05:35.080 --> 1:05:39.400]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup

[1:08:24.440 --> 1:08:29.680]  left in the syndicated radio broadcast Bob Chapman the international forecasher
[1:08:29.680 --> 1:08:32.320]  will be joining us in the next hour to break down what's happening with the
[1:08:32.320 --> 1:08:36.400]  economy and the new world order the private banking syndicate that is
[1:08:36.400 --> 1:08:40.360]  dominating and controlling our planet I'm also going to be detailing a key
[1:08:40.360 --> 1:08:45.720]  article that just went up on prisonplanet.com that I worked on with Paul
[1:08:45.720 --> 1:08:50.440]  Watson in about 5 30 in the morning when I got up cap and trade scam to be
[1:08:50.440 --> 1:08:54.680]  enforced at state level individuals and businesses in Austin and a plethora of
[1:08:54.680 --> 1:09:00.520]  other states to be taxed for emissions of life-giving carbon dioxide and it
[1:09:00.520 --> 1:09:04.560]  details how we may have defeated Copenhagen and exposed the fact that it
[1:09:04.560 --> 1:09:13.280]  was a premeditated system to tax the pound and a half or so of carbon dioxide
[1:09:13.280 --> 1:09:17.000]  that humans exhale every day while ignoring all the other serious real
[1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:20.880]  environmental problems like genetic engineering cross species engineering and
[1:09:20.880 --> 1:09:24.520]  other things that we talk overfishing in the ocean toxic waste dumping that's
[1:09:24.520 --> 1:09:27.840]  why it's come out in Ron developed a scam in the mid 90s that's why it's come
[1:09:27.840 --> 1:09:31.680]  out actually big oils funding and all that's why Howard Dean and even Dennis
[1:09:31.680 --> 1:09:34.960]  Cassinature against the government health care plan they finally read the
[1:09:34.960 --> 1:09:38.640]  bill it gives it liability protection to the insurance companies and hospitals
[1:09:38.640 --> 1:09:43.280]  it puts 40 plus billion dollars of taxes a year on Medicare and Medicaid it cuts
[1:09:43.280 --> 1:09:49.400]  the services you get and then actually jacks up the prices so the banker bail
[1:09:49.400 --> 1:09:53.400]  out a scam the health care plan a scam the forced fluid
[1:09:53.400 --> 1:09:57.480]  inoculation system a scam now even the EU Commission says they bought off their
[1:09:57.480 --> 1:10:01.400]  leaders paid them off the vaccines dangerous the German government wouldn't
[1:10:01.400 --> 1:10:06.520]  even take the shots themselves all of that is going on so but they don't care
[1:10:06.520 --> 1:10:11.120]  if we expose Copenhagen as a direct global tax to be paid to the IMF and
[1:10:11.120 --> 1:10:16.240]  World Bank George Soros the Rothschilds the Rockefellers Pichari head of the IPCC
[1:10:16.240 --> 1:10:21.760]  Barack Obama a lot of Republicans are involved they don't care they're now
[1:10:21.760 --> 1:10:25.320]  coming into the states the counties the cities and they're going to put taxes on
[1:10:25.320 --> 1:10:30.960]  everything shut down the power plants make you go to solar and wind which it's
[1:10:30.960 --> 1:10:35.720]  great to put that in but it destroys 2.2 jobs for every job you make and in Spain
[1:10:35.720 --> 1:10:42.880]  cost $700,000 per job they created and it doesn't produce a lot of power it's
[1:10:42.880 --> 1:10:46.400]  hard to transfer it down the lines there's so many things involved with that so
[1:10:46.400 --> 1:10:52.840]  that key article coming up in the next hour now Dean Haglin I guess four years
[1:10:52.840 --> 1:10:58.680]  ago three and a half four years ago yeah a long time ago I got a call he's going
[1:10:58.680 --> 1:11:01.600]  to be in Austin came over to my house interviewed me so you've been working on
[1:11:01.600 --> 1:11:04.280]  this documentary for a long time for those that don't know he did an episode of
[1:11:04.280 --> 1:11:08.800]  bones last week he's been on literally dozens and dozens of movies TV shows of
[1:11:08.800 --> 1:11:14.080]  course one of the big stars on the X files and the lone gunman and he's here
[1:11:14.080 --> 1:11:18.360]  with us and he's making a documentary I guess four years in the making called
[1:11:18.360 --> 1:11:23.240]  called the truth is out there and so we're very very honored to have Dean
[1:11:23.240 --> 1:11:26.200]  Haglin here and because I've got to leave early today for a bunch of other
[1:11:26.200 --> 1:11:29.680]  business I've got to do we're going to conduct my interview with him but also
[1:11:29.680 --> 1:11:36.160]  his interview with me here on aired together today so we'll kind of have a
[1:11:36.160 --> 1:11:40.520]  double combo kill two birds with one stone but Dean Haglin it's great to
[1:11:40.520 --> 1:11:43.680]  have you here with us my friend Alex great to see you again my friend I can't
[1:11:43.680 --> 1:11:46.760]  believe that's been four years ago that came over to your house right that
[1:11:46.760 --> 1:11:50.200]  studio was in your it was it well first you came to my house to interview me yeah
[1:11:50.200 --> 1:11:54.480]  and then about two years later you came to my studio yes your first studio which
[1:11:54.480 --> 1:11:57.960]  was a small one and now look at this operation this is very impressive to see
[1:11:57.960 --> 1:12:01.800]  how it grows well we're building a TV studio next door are you kidding me yeah
[1:12:01.800 --> 1:12:05.520]  this is a simple one but yeah that's impressive but anyway yeah we're doing
[1:12:05.520 --> 1:12:09.880]  this documentary called the truth is out there it's an exploration you know as I
[1:12:09.880 --> 1:12:15.000]  played a conspiracy theorist on the X files for ten years my life now has
[1:12:15.000 --> 1:12:17.880]  taken on to where I go to sci-fi conventions and stuff like that and
[1:12:17.880 --> 1:12:21.640]  people come up and tell me that conspiracy theories and and experiences so
[1:12:21.640 --> 1:12:24.800]  now we're traveling around the world and these people are coming up to me and
[1:12:24.800 --> 1:12:27.880]  of course you're a big part of that because every time I've come on your
[1:12:27.880 --> 1:12:33.640]  show it's been fantastic I always love it I follow you online all the time and I
[1:12:33.640 --> 1:12:36.400]  just want to know a bit about your background I don't even know how you
[1:12:36.400 --> 1:12:43.080]  got to this place I just had it all start for you way back when so radio is
[1:12:43.080 --> 1:12:46.120]  sure I mean I guess we could do the questions first for me and then I got
[1:12:46.120 --> 1:12:49.240]  I've got questions for you and news items I want to do back and forth what
[1:12:49.240 --> 1:12:56.040]  exactly I want to get your take on it well Dean to answer your question going
[1:12:56.040 --> 1:13:00.800]  back about 16 years ago I had already read a lot of history books so I knew
[1:13:00.800 --> 1:13:03.960]  how governments really operated from a wide spectrum analysis of history did
[1:13:03.960 --> 1:13:07.160]  you go to U of T here in Austin no I went to community college and learned
[1:13:07.160 --> 1:13:12.480]  that they were propagandizing me there because I read so much you know famous
[1:13:12.480 --> 1:13:15.480]  history books even it was totally different from what was being taught in
[1:13:15.480 --> 1:13:18.800]  school mm-hmm I was being taught global governments good the second amendments
[1:13:18.800 --> 1:13:23.760]  bad I was being taught a left-right paradigm it didn't fit into anything that
[1:13:23.760 --> 1:13:27.520]  I had read you know previous you know to that hundred years where people were
[1:13:27.520 --> 1:13:32.160]  taught liberty versus tyranny freedom versus slavery and I learned that the
[1:13:32.160 --> 1:13:34.720]  same interests were controlling both political parties and almost every
[1:13:34.720 --> 1:13:41.640]  nation and so I went started an access TV show 14 years ago wow and within six
[1:13:41.640 --> 1:13:45.600]  months I had a local radio show they offered it to me the program director
[1:13:45.600 --> 1:13:49.760]  saw the show and liked it and then a few months later I was on two days a week
[1:13:49.760 --> 1:13:54.320]  and then a few months later I was on seven days a week and then I started
[1:13:54.320 --> 1:14:00.640]  self-sindicating my own radio show and so for 13 years now I've been
[1:14:00.640 --> 1:14:06.560]  syndicated you know to mom and pops and underground AM and FM radio stations
[1:14:06.560 --> 1:14:13.520]  right and I started info wars.com in 1998 and so we've had that for 12 years
[1:14:13.520 --> 1:14:17.720]  yeah and it's gotten better and better and we just continue to slowly grow and
[1:14:17.720 --> 1:14:22.080]  slowly expand and slow and easy wins the race really not slow and easy it's a
[1:14:22.080 --> 1:14:27.880]  you know hectic schedule but yeah but but still we just continue our work to try
[1:14:27.880 --> 1:14:30.960]  to shatter the left right paradigm the people start thinking outside the box
[1:14:30.960 --> 1:14:35.960]  and really looking at the official history I mean the elites admit what
[1:14:35.960 --> 1:14:39.040]  they've done in their own annals their own documents their own articles and
[1:14:39.040 --> 1:14:42.000]  they always laugh at us and say the public won't read this I mean Carol
[1:14:42.000 --> 1:14:45.640]  Quigley was led into the elites own documents in the 60s wrote tragedy and
[1:14:45.640 --> 1:14:48.880]  hope admitting we control the left we control the right we put in the
[1:14:48.880 --> 1:14:52.880]  communist and the fascist we want a global dictatorship run by the banks
[1:14:52.880 --> 1:14:55.840]  David Rockefeller wrote a book four years ago saying I want a one-world
[1:14:55.840 --> 1:15:02.160]  government that is you know unelected they had a financial times of London
[1:15:02.160 --> 1:15:06.440]  article but they've had scores of them but last year saying and now for global
[1:15:06.440 --> 1:15:10.160]  government and he said yes we've kept it secret for your own good and that's
[1:15:10.160 --> 1:15:14.320]  that publications on with a Bilderberg group a Bilderberg group member he said
[1:15:14.320 --> 1:15:20.080]  it's secret we are going to basically take over the society it's authoritarian
[1:15:20.080 --> 1:15:23.680]  for your own good we're gonna have carbon taxes on you we're gonna control
[1:15:23.680 --> 1:15:27.520]  the refaction of your life and they've now had thousands of articles the last
[1:15:27.520 --> 1:15:31.480]  year in every major publication going okay world government's real okay
[1:15:31.480 --> 1:15:35.320]  planetary regime is real right there's coming forward with this quite openly it
[1:15:35.320 --> 1:15:40.160]  seems and see they stalled us until they think it's too late right and that's the
[1:15:40.160 --> 1:15:44.880]  thing right that we've sort of numbed our brain we got into a robotic way of
[1:15:44.880 --> 1:15:48.200]  thinking and that now they can just sort of bring this stuff forward and nobody
[1:15:48.200 --> 1:15:52.160]  will rise up against it is that the idea that's it the public is on soma
[1:15:52.160 --> 1:15:54.800]  they're drinking the sodium fluoride and all the other chemicals in the water
[1:15:54.800 --> 1:15:59.840]  that all the mainline studies admit causes cancer brain damage 20 point on
[1:15:59.840 --> 1:16:07.800]  average IQ reduction in children it is a chemical compound that's just one that
[1:16:07.800 --> 1:16:10.960]  they put in that just builds up and builds up our whole food supply I mean
[1:16:10.960 --> 1:16:16.160]  that's the GMO they admit killing the rats that eat it yeah baby weights are
[1:16:16.160 --> 1:16:20.840]  going down retardation is going up autism is going up it's shock infertility is
[1:16:20.840 --> 1:16:24.320]  exploding yeah that for 10,000 years we've eaten the same thing until the
[1:16:24.320 --> 1:16:29.240]  last 30 years our entire food supply has changed completely nutritionally
[1:16:29.240 --> 1:16:32.640]  chemically to the point where our bodies don't that's why there's no
[1:16:32.640 --> 1:16:36.960]  obesity epidemic I suppose and you can hold up you exactly you can hold up a
[1:16:36.960 --> 1:16:43.680]  thousand government studies university studies peer reviewed saying it kills the
[1:16:43.680 --> 1:16:47.720]  rats it makes them sick with every major cross species genetically engineered
[1:16:47.720 --> 1:16:53.200]  food crop the potatoes the tomatoes the corn absolute fact coming out every day
[1:16:53.200 --> 1:16:57.240]  and they just say get used to it shut up conspiracy theorists right and then we
[1:16:57.240 --> 1:17:01.000]  have all these u.n. documents and others from 30 40 years ago saying we will
[1:17:01.000 --> 1:17:05.280]  engineer the food supply to incrementally sterilize people in fact I have this
[1:17:05.280 --> 1:17:10.160]  book eco science written by the current White House science are and in there he
[1:17:10.160 --> 1:17:14.800]  says we've got to engineer the water supply the food supply to slowly and
[1:17:14.800 --> 1:17:20.200]  incrementally sterilize people so it's an incremental infertility 80 plus
[1:17:20.200 --> 1:17:26.640]  percent sperm reduction in men baby weights going down it's it I mean they
[1:17:26.640 --> 1:17:31.400]  are chemically in the water supply and in the food attacking us and in
[1:17:31.400 --> 1:17:34.480]  government textbook I mean they're now proposing on the news putting lithium in
[1:17:34.480 --> 1:17:38.520]  the water Dean I did not hear that what would be the purpose of putting lithium
[1:17:38.520 --> 1:17:43.480]  I mean one there well they say if it stops one suicide you're not for suicide
[1:17:43.480 --> 1:17:47.440]  are you Dean you're putting lithium in the water not pursuing if you're putting
[1:17:47.440 --> 1:17:51.920]  lithium in the water stops one suicide it's worth it are you kidding no that's
[1:17:51.920 --> 1:17:58.200]  what they're now proposing well so this is what I wonder now personally you've
[1:17:58.200 --> 1:18:03.560]  done this fight now for 14 years the emotional toll of this sort of thing
[1:18:03.560 --> 1:18:07.960]  what has that done for you is that how do you get up in the morning and fight
[1:18:07.960 --> 1:18:12.360]  this fight so passionately and and carry on because I know a lot of people that
[1:18:12.360 --> 1:18:15.680]  will you know get into conspiracies they'll give themselves a stroke our
[1:18:15.680 --> 1:18:19.400]  own producers in the hospital every other day because of this you know it
[1:18:19.400 --> 1:18:23.840]  it's it's it's so stressful on a lot of people because you know the truth you've
[1:18:23.840 --> 1:18:27.720]  seen the documents you read the elites saying they're gonna do it right I mean
[1:18:27.720 --> 1:18:30.360]  I had Rothkopf head of the Kissinger Group on a few years ago you wrote a
[1:18:30.360 --> 1:18:33.640]  book called Superstake you ought to go interviewing and he says yeah world
[1:18:33.640 --> 1:18:36.240]  governments here it's for your own good we're gonna carbon-taxing take over your
[1:18:36.240 --> 1:18:40.920]  life and a few thousand leaders run everything and then I have newspaper
[1:18:40.920 --> 1:18:45.080]  reporters in here and they go Alex it doesn't exist I had a Texas monthly
[1:18:45.080 --> 1:18:49.120]  rider in here often on three or four times and he would just say no they're
[1:18:49.120 --> 1:18:51.600]  not putting hundreds of chemicals in the water and I would give him all the
[1:18:51.600 --> 1:18:55.320]  documents he'd say wow it's true but still I don't agree with you and and hey
[1:18:55.320 --> 1:19:00.880]  here's all these studies admitting that just this one type of GMO corn from
[1:19:00.880 --> 1:19:05.000]  Monsanto that has pesticide that grows naturally in it yeah so it bugs eat it
[1:19:05.000 --> 1:19:09.240]  they die is causing liver failure in all the mammals they tested on massive
[1:19:09.240 --> 1:19:13.680]  death and it's still well I don't want to talk about it I mean because they
[1:19:13.680 --> 1:19:17.960]  can't understand it they can't believe someone's doing it on purpose well let's
[1:19:17.960 --> 1:19:21.120]  say they're not doing it on purpose Monsanto knew in the mid 80s when they
[1:19:21.120 --> 1:19:24.760]  got approval for this and they've got a whole bunch of varieties everyone does
[1:19:24.760 --> 1:19:29.360]  similar things some some worse than others they they know it's out they keep
[1:19:29.360 --> 1:19:36.400]  doing it you know bear pharmaceutical for over a decade knowingly allowed for
[1:19:36.400 --> 1:19:40.840]  HIV to be at all their factor rate and hepatitis killing over a million people
[1:19:40.840 --> 1:19:44.440]  all over the world and then I said the reporter I said see they're killing us
[1:19:44.440 --> 1:19:48.640]  they know and he says but they didn't mean to what the hell are you talking
[1:19:48.640 --> 1:19:53.680]  about okay fine none of them went to prison right why is that okay I've got
[1:19:53.680 --> 1:19:57.040]  all these textbooks where they're doing is to its that's what I'm angry about
[1:19:57.040 --> 1:20:01.600]  Dean Haglin and we've got to get angry like humans stay there we all know that

[1:21:24.440 --> 1:21:28.880]  ever experienced this is not only a transfer of power to an institution that
[1:21:28.880 --> 1:21:32.080]  is not accountable to our elected government but has also caused the
[1:21:32.080 --> 1:21:36.160]  dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value now foreign governments

[1:24:12.680 --> 1:24:16.240]  he's really here to interview me so we're multitasking right now
[1:24:16.240 --> 1:24:20.280]  multitasking Dean go ahead and ask your question well that I'm wondering about
[1:24:20.280 --> 1:24:25.200]  the personal the personal toll this quest this mission that you've been on you
[1:24:25.200 --> 1:24:29.440]  said it yourself this mission to bring out the truth to everyone I know other
[1:24:29.440 --> 1:24:34.000]  people who get into conspiracies often find it very stressful and yet it is it
[1:24:34.000 --> 1:24:39.080]  is very stressful but when people attack me and people lie about me and people
[1:24:39.080 --> 1:24:43.800]  make stuff up and run their co-intel pro operations it only makes me more
[1:24:43.800 --> 1:24:48.120]  focused and more angry and more determined and actually gives me energy
[1:24:48.120 --> 1:24:55.240]  wow so so that's why I've seen the toll it takes on most people yeah and it has
[1:24:55.240 --> 1:24:58.760]  taken a toll I mean I look a lot older than I actually am I'm thinking you're
[1:24:58.760 --> 1:25:01.880]  looking younger than when I first saw you well I have lost about 35 pounds and
[1:25:01.880 --> 1:25:05.200]  I'm gonna try to get on about another 30 you're working out yeah I am jogging and
[1:25:05.200 --> 1:25:11.000]  lifting weights about for you but I mean I I decided and committed myself no
[1:25:11.000 --> 1:25:14.640]  matter they put me in prison no matter if they kill me no matter they destroy my
[1:25:14.640 --> 1:25:18.800]  name in the media and lie about me I know I'm good I know I told the truth I
[1:25:18.800 --> 1:25:24.480]  know I did my research I know that I have accurately forecast so much of what's
[1:25:24.480 --> 1:25:28.080]  happened so two months before 9-11 you're welcome for your film to use that
[1:25:28.080 --> 1:25:31.760]  clip yeah me locally on access TV and the radio saying they're gonna stage an
[1:25:31.760 --> 1:25:34.600]  attack blame it on bin Laden on the World Trade Center to bring in these new
[1:25:34.600 --> 1:25:42.240]  wars and we said in January of last year 2009 we said that we're getting
[1:25:42.240 --> 1:25:45.160]  word they're gonna stage a big flu freak out we don't know if it's gonna be a
[1:25:45.160 --> 1:25:48.920]  money-making op or the excuse for martial law but we got secret documents
[1:25:48.920 --> 1:25:53.640]  Bureau of Prisons New York State that get ready for millions dead we got secret
[1:25:53.640 --> 1:25:57.240]  documents and interviewed guests and interviewed other media that interviewed
[1:25:57.240 --> 1:26:00.600]  emergency managers in Indiana and Illinois they were saying get ready for
[1:26:00.600 --> 1:26:04.880]  martial law millions dead right the flu will come it will kill millions I went
[1:26:04.880 --> 1:26:08.880]  on air and I said there is a massive buildup from California to New York from
[1:26:08.880 --> 1:26:14.280]  Texas to Michigan as a federalization drill bare minimum to scare everyone
[1:26:14.280 --> 1:26:17.880]  into forced inoculation and submission and then it all happened and then we
[1:26:17.880 --> 1:26:21.000]  got secret documents from the state of Texas our sources that they were really
[1:26:21.000 --> 1:26:24.400]  going to a level six to declare a global pandemic when it wasn't even gonna be a
[1:26:24.400 --> 1:26:28.280]  pandemic we posted those secret documents got ridiculed two months later it
[1:26:28.280 --> 1:26:31.280]  came out that was the case we've been under level six the whole time yeah I
[1:26:31.280 --> 1:26:37.520]  was then able to point out that it the whole thing was a hoax now it's being
[1:26:37.520 --> 1:26:41.160]  investigated by the EU and they're saying it is a hoax where the big pharma
[1:26:41.160 --> 1:26:45.280]  bought off all the major government advisors to say this was real and deadly
[1:26:45.280 --> 1:26:50.160]  and so what happens time and time again is on so many subjects I mean I told
[1:26:50.160 --> 1:26:55.200]  people in January of 2009 I said Obama will have the lowest approval rating of
[1:26:55.200 --> 1:26:58.640]  any president by the end of the year he will go back on everything he promised
[1:26:58.640 --> 1:27:02.120]  to do because I knew who his advisors were and what they had been saying they
[1:27:02.120 --> 1:27:07.200]  were sending out quiet press releases to heads of government and others saying
[1:27:07.200 --> 1:27:10.400]  don't worry he's not getting rid of napkin get don't worry he's not getting
[1:27:10.400 --> 1:27:14.720]  us out of the WTO don't worry he's not gonna end the wars he's gonna expand
[1:27:14.720 --> 1:27:18.000]  them don't worry he's gonna keep the torture and secret arrest and rendition
[1:27:18.000 --> 1:27:22.440]  going I mean they were putting out in the lobbyist reports don't worry it's a
[1:27:22.440 --> 1:27:27.840]  scam just like the insurance company six months ago put out releases to other
[1:27:27.840 --> 1:27:32.320]  lobbyist groups say don't oppose this we're just saying we're against the the
[1:27:32.320 --> 1:27:37.000]  healthcare thing so people won't know it's a big moneymaker for us right but
[1:27:37.000 --> 1:27:40.000]  then the Democrats actually found out Howard Dean and others and said whoa
[1:27:40.000 --> 1:27:45.280]  don't vote for this see so so we go off their own documents yeah because the
[1:27:45.280 --> 1:27:49.760]  New World Order is so big that most of what they do isn't really secret it's
[1:27:49.760 --> 1:27:52.780]  just not in the newspaper until after they've done it well and this is my
[1:27:52.780 --> 1:27:56.720]  question then how do you know I mean where there's all these alternative
[1:27:56.720 --> 1:28:01.360]  sources of information we live in an information blizzard right now so any
[1:28:01.360 --> 1:28:05.920]  comfort zone that anybody wants to sit in mentally they can go to any website
[1:28:05.920 --> 1:28:09.480]  that will you know feed that information they want there's a million
[1:28:09.480 --> 1:28:14.360]  different flavors and niches absolutely and we're not in any niche right we
[1:28:14.360 --> 1:28:19.760]  don't say the Vatican runs it all or Jews run it all or seventh-day Adventist or
[1:28:19.760 --> 1:28:24.680]  bad and run it all or Scientologists run it all yeah or or the Chinese are
[1:28:24.680 --> 1:28:31.160]  behind it or you know we go to the real history powerful guilds of psychopaths
[1:28:31.160 --> 1:28:36.520]  and criminal networks of every race religion and group at the top meet and
[1:28:36.520 --> 1:28:40.440]  sometimes they fight with each other but they meet and discuss the rules like in
[1:28:40.440 --> 1:28:44.280]  the godfather a mafia commission meeting the bill Debra group that's what they
[1:28:44.280 --> 1:28:49.840]  do and there's different groups together agreeing on the next year's agenda and I
[1:28:49.840 --> 1:28:55.520]  don't go off the thousands of conspiracy sites I don't go off of rumors I get a
[1:28:55.520 --> 1:28:59.120]  call that they've shut down the Austin gun show I start making calls to the gun
[1:28:59.120 --> 1:29:03.720]  show owner I start making calls the police I get the document I find out it
[1:29:03.720 --> 1:29:07.960]  really happened we break the big story it becomes a national news issue police
[1:29:07.960 --> 1:29:11.720]  send me secret my act and homeland security documents where they're saying
[1:29:11.720 --> 1:29:15.520]  homeland security is really for peace activists gun owners conservatives
[1:29:15.520 --> 1:29:20.520]  libertarians returning veterans that the whole architecture is built for the
[1:29:20.520 --> 1:29:24.880]  American people we then put it out the Cointel pro the government ops all say
[1:29:24.880 --> 1:29:29.680]  it's fake then the media is forced to admit it's real so every time just like
[1:29:29.680 --> 1:29:33.480]  when I expose 9-11 or any other big issue I know I'm gonna be attacked but
[1:29:33.480 --> 1:29:37.120]  then the truth is gonna come out I mean they had a stage sigh up earlier this
[1:29:37.120 --> 1:29:41.520]  week but I know the truth will come out on that and so I understand that truth
[1:29:41.520 --> 1:29:45.960]  is invincible and as long as I go forward and don't care what people say or do
[1:29:45.960 --> 1:29:48.920]  we're gonna win we're gonna come right back deal with more of your questions
[1:29:48.920 --> 1:29:56.160]  straight ahead we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the
[1:29:56.160 --> 1:30:02.600]  GCN radio network this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should
[1:30:02.600 --> 1:30:07.040]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[1:30:07.040 --> 1:30:11.080]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energy czar
[1:30:11.080 --> 1:30:14.960]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[1:30:14.960 --> 1:30:18.960]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[1:30:18.960 --> 1:30:23.520]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[1:30:23.520 --> 1:30:27.520]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[1:30:27.520 --> 1:30:31.360]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[1:30:31.360 --> 1:30:34.960]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[1:30:34.960 --> 1:30:39.320]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[1:30:39.320 --> 1:30:42.480]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[1:30:42.480 --> 1:30:46.160]  generators offered by solution from science one of my oldest sponsors you

[1:31:09.720 --> 1:31:13.640]  solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the
[1:31:13.640 --> 1:31:17.520]  lungs the respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne
[1:31:17.520 --> 1:31:22.480]  pathogens and viruses the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system
[1:31:22.480 --> 1:31:27.760]  with your self-produced nano silver solutions and also delivers the silver
[1:31:27.760 --> 1:31:32.360]  nano particles instantly into the bloodstream with continued legislation
[1:31:32.360 --> 1:31:36.600]  threatening the sale of nano silver products you can now produce pure and
[1:31:36.600 --> 1:31:41.360]  endless colloidal silver with the silver lungs generator very easy to follow

[1:32:05.320 --> 1:32:09.880]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda
[1:32:09.880 --> 1:32:13.240]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home
[1:32:13.240 --> 1:32:18.880]  tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling
[1:32:18.880 --> 1:32:24.160]  the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[1:32:24.160 --> 1:32:28.160]  attention fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the
[1:32:28.160 --> 1:32:33.360]  criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes
[1:32:33.360 --> 1:32:37.400]  constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're
[1:32:37.400 --> 1:32:41.080]  asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the check out to
[1:32:41.080 --> 1:32:45.880]  today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have

[1:33:18.720 --> 1:33:21.880]  me a few days ago you're saying you want to interview me so that's fine
[1:33:21.880 --> 1:33:25.400]  something different for the listeners but I'm gonna try to back Bob Chapman up
[1:33:25.400 --> 1:33:29.520]  15 minutes into the next hour so that and I didn't know you just came to
[1:33:29.520 --> 1:33:35.360]  Austin interview me I'm honored that way we can we can actually have some time
[1:33:35.360 --> 1:33:39.240]  to talk to you as well okay I mean I am ranting Dean please continue I love the
[1:33:39.240 --> 1:33:43.160]  ranting and this is the thing you know you are of course connected to all this
[1:33:43.160 --> 1:33:47.800]  information but my question is then how does a person like me the average Joe
[1:33:47.800 --> 1:33:52.360]  navigate their way through all of this and and find this truth I mean other
[1:33:52.360 --> 1:33:57.880]  than coming to your website there is there advice you have for some one
[1:33:57.880 --> 1:34:04.840]  that is trying to assimilate all these disparaging and seemingly contradictory
[1:34:04.840 --> 1:34:10.600]  stories and information well what what the global engineers do and we already
[1:34:10.600 --> 1:34:17.760]  knew this from Cointel Pro documents like the one I have right here that was
[1:34:17.760 --> 1:34:21.600]  a government program to get alternative media groups activists to fight with
[1:34:21.600 --> 1:34:26.760]  each other oh we know that there are those type of programs but we have cast
[1:34:26.760 --> 1:34:31.880]  Sunstein the White House technologies are the White House regulations are
[1:34:31.880 --> 1:34:36.880]  rather we have cast Sunstein the White House regulations are coming out in
[1:34:36.880 --> 1:34:43.800]  white papers just saying we we want to infiltrate people's groups come up with
[1:34:43.800 --> 1:34:47.720]  wild conspiracy theories that are totally ridiculous as we've done in the
[1:34:47.720 --> 1:34:51.800]  past is what he says and he says we want to get everybody in fighting with each
[1:34:51.800 --> 1:34:55.240]  other and we want to start moving towards making it illegal to criticize
[1:34:55.240 --> 1:34:59.240]  man-made global warming he said we'll even make it illegal to say that a
[1:34:59.240 --> 1:35:03.240]  little bit of sunshine is good for you we will set the parameter very wide where
[1:35:03.240 --> 1:35:07.720]  nothing is acceptable for discussion but what we say so it's more than just a
[1:35:07.720 --> 1:35:11.240]  label to discredit what people are saying to call them conspiracy theorist
[1:35:11.240 --> 1:35:16.200]  really it's about saying we're gonna arrest Galileo if he says that the sun
[1:35:16.200 --> 1:35:21.720]  is the center of our solar system not the earth if you say that the earth is
[1:35:21.720 --> 1:35:26.800]  orbiting the sun you're a conspiracy theorist basically it is a type of
[1:35:26.800 --> 1:35:31.160]  heresy and so what they're saying is we give you a very narrow and it's always
[1:35:31.160 --> 1:35:34.920]  getting more and more narrow in this herwellian system set of things that
[1:35:34.920 --> 1:35:37.840]  are acceptable you don't talk about politics or religion you don't get
[1:35:37.840 --> 1:35:41.080]  politically involved you don't talk to your neighbors that's bad you don't talk
[1:35:41.080 --> 1:35:45.000]  about the foreign banks you don't talk about the banker bailout you don't
[1:35:45.000 --> 1:35:49.640]  criticize the government you know all of that is unacceptable so so they attack
[1:35:49.640 --> 1:35:54.160]  they infiltrate and then they have radio and TV shows and other things that will
[1:35:54.160 --> 1:35:58.440]  mix just like the X files and I'm not criticizing it but we know they did it
[1:35:58.440 --> 1:36:02.120]  yeah and I'd like to ask you about this you know that would mix a Chubicabra one
[1:36:02.120 --> 1:36:06.760]  episode with deadly GMO crops that sterilize you the next and that's
[1:36:06.760 --> 1:36:10.040]  actually what they're doing just like you said the CIA would come to Chris
[1:36:10.040 --> 1:36:13.720]  Carter and others and say we'd like to see this in your episodes and he'd say
[1:36:13.720 --> 1:36:17.920]  okay gee that's an interesting idea and no notice most the episodes that they
[1:36:17.920 --> 1:36:22.000]  would push for would be real serious things that they or others were planning
[1:36:22.000 --> 1:36:25.520]  to do right so when it actually happened people were psychologically
[1:36:25.520 --> 1:36:29.840]  inoculated in a revelation of the methods subconsciously to say oh that's
[1:36:29.840 --> 1:36:33.120]  just entertainment right I know you watch too much X files if that's what
[1:36:33.120 --> 1:36:37.400]  you're believing right exactly so so one episode of flying saucer lands with a
[1:36:37.400 --> 1:36:41.800]  worm that gets inside people and makes them mind control slaves ridiculous
[1:36:41.800 --> 1:36:46.040]  right not saying in the universe that couldn't exist and the next episode
[1:36:46.040 --> 1:36:50.360]  there's a private group of bankers that are running everything well well no
[1:36:50.360 --> 1:36:54.800]  that's a fact so see that's the and that's how media the only time mainstream
[1:36:54.800 --> 1:37:00.080]  media allows this to be programmed into mainstream TV or mainstream radio is to
[1:37:00.080 --> 1:37:06.040]  you know this hour we're gonna be talking to Catherine Austin Fitz about
[1:37:06.040 --> 1:37:10.600]  how when she was at at HUD the government was running giant fraudulent
[1:37:10.600 --> 1:37:14.760]  scams totally real totally documented right and then next hour we're gonna
[1:37:14.760 --> 1:37:18.880]  talk to demon possessed werewolf people okay so see then it gets discredited
[1:37:18.880 --> 1:37:22.200]  because demon possessed werewolf people and I'm not attacking folks that do
[1:37:22.200 --> 1:37:25.520]  that right it's entertaining it's interesting it's fine and a lot of those
[1:37:25.520 --> 1:37:28.000]  folks have made the point well this is entertainment on the show this is
[1:37:28.000 --> 1:37:32.280]  serious I don't do any of that right I don't because it listeners will find me
[1:37:32.280 --> 1:37:36.280]  talking about star children from alphas and turries are interesting this is not
[1:37:36.280 --> 1:37:41.800]  a variety show we don't do that right I sit here and I go off the real facts and
[1:37:41.800 --> 1:37:47.320]  I take a mainstream news article like a story I have over here where it says
[1:37:47.320 --> 1:37:52.240]  bin Laden blast US for climate change and then at the end of the AP article
[1:37:52.240 --> 1:37:55.480]  right this is worse journalism than the then the high school journalism
[1:37:55.480 --> 1:37:59.920]  department right it says the new message authenticity could not be immediately
[1:37:59.920 --> 1:38:04.920]  confirmed and neither could last weeks so now any audio tape they put out has
[1:38:04.920 --> 1:38:07.600]  been laden and they've had the linguist listen they've done the voice key
[1:38:07.600 --> 1:38:12.160]  identification it isn't even anybody near him it's just fake fake videos
[1:38:12.160 --> 1:38:16.320]  edited from old videos they've been caught right the Intel Center admittedly
[1:38:16.320 --> 1:38:22.280]  run by two of Rumsfeld's former top guys who were in psyops at the CIA
[1:38:22.280 --> 1:38:28.480]  previously they always upload the Adam Goodon grandson of the former ADL head
[1:38:28.480 --> 1:38:32.880]  you know he comes out as the American al-Qaeda and they put the Intel Center
[1:38:32.880 --> 1:38:37.320]  logo in the same video layer as the al-Qaeda logo so it wasn't another
[1:38:37.320 --> 1:38:41.200]  version of the video they got and laid theirs in anybody who understands digital
[1:38:41.200 --> 1:38:44.680]  pixels people have degrees in this we'd already done it before it came out in
[1:38:44.680 --> 1:38:48.240]  wire magazine other places we pull it up and blow it up on screen because it
[1:38:48.240 --> 1:38:52.120]  should be different pixel layers it's the same pixel layer wow you understand
[1:38:52.120 --> 1:38:55.320]  yeah so they're they're putting the watermark in it it's so that they
[1:38:55.320 --> 1:38:59.280]  basically created it they created it because that watermarks already placed
[1:38:59.280 --> 1:39:04.560]  in and it's a hundred percent wow wow I mean if you see online videos where it's
[1:39:04.560 --> 1:39:08.640]  somebody's news video and then somebody slaps up but say their website on it you
[1:39:08.640 --> 1:39:12.000]  notice it's crisp but there's pixelation around the edges yeah that's just with
[1:39:12.000 --> 1:39:17.000]  one generation this is scientific yeah scientific you can tell the compression
[1:39:17.000 --> 1:39:20.640]  rate what it was done on what type of compression what type of machine they
[1:39:20.640 --> 1:39:24.480]  have computer programs a decade ago you can run them through with fingerprints
[1:39:24.480 --> 1:39:28.400]  and tell okay there were three generations before the Intel Center put
[1:39:28.400 --> 1:39:34.880]  their logo on no same first-generation Crispin clear al-Qaeda videos coming out
[1:39:34.880 --> 1:39:39.320]  from the US government and that's just for disinformation to confuse us to scare
[1:39:39.320 --> 1:39:43.400]  people yeah oh my gosh there's a new audio tape found on a website it's been
[1:39:43.400 --> 1:39:47.800]  laden he says he carried out the underwear bombing hey oh my gosh he says
[1:39:47.800 --> 1:39:52.320]  we better pass global warming rules or he's gonna attack us again right oh my
[1:39:52.320 --> 1:39:56.360]  gosh he says we better you know given to big government or he'll climb up
[1:39:56.360 --> 1:40:01.280]  underneath the bed and eat us but now okay so let me ask this question then if
[1:40:01.280 --> 1:40:06.920]  media and that media control yet you're affiliated now with ABC is that right
[1:40:06.920 --> 1:40:11.080]  or ABC radio no absolutely not true see that's how internet disinformation works
[1:40:11.080 --> 1:40:15.600]  thank you and that's definitely co-intel pro in that case you have a cell phone
[1:40:15.600 --> 1:40:20.560]  Dean I do I may I have it please no but I mean may I have it right there okay this
[1:40:20.560 --> 1:40:24.440]  is an iPhone like I have yeah I have an iPhone now I have an iPhone too in fact
[1:40:24.440 --> 1:40:28.600]  it's out there we bring it to me I don't own any stock in Apple right Apple
[1:40:28.600 --> 1:40:31.400]  Corporation doesn't tell me what to do right I have nothing to do with Steve
[1:40:31.400 --> 1:40:35.320]  Jobs I've absolutely nothing to do with any of this but I have an Apple phone
[1:40:35.320 --> 1:40:41.760]  yeah okay and I have a Toshiba television right okay LG over there yes
[1:40:41.760 --> 1:40:45.680]  now if you wanted to do a radio show by yourself and syndicate it yourself you'd
[1:40:45.680 --> 1:40:49.640]  have to go to Jones Broadcasting you'd have to go to Clear Channel or you have
[1:40:49.640 --> 1:40:53.720]  to go to ABC satellite there's three providers and any radio station owner
[1:40:53.720 --> 1:40:56.000]  listening this is laughing because they understand this is a fact and how
[1:40:56.000 --> 1:41:01.240]  ridiculous it is right now Jones just won't sell a feed to anybody Clear
[1:41:01.240 --> 1:41:05.200]  Channel didn't tell us this until we actually least one Ted Anderson did the
[1:41:05.200 --> 1:41:09.920]  owner little network I'm on he went and actually least one for here and found
[1:41:09.920 --> 1:41:14.680]  out oh we didn't tell you we won't give you the decoding scramble code for
[1:41:14.680 --> 1:41:17.960]  stations that want to pull that you have thousands of feeds to sell so that was
[1:41:17.960 --> 1:41:23.360]  Ted was out 12 times $5,000 it was $5,000 a month so Ted went and
[1:41:23.360 --> 1:41:26.720]  and he was trying to be on little TV satellites but you have to ship those to
[1:41:26.720 --> 1:41:30.040]  stations because stations never had them hooked up because they get radio and
[1:41:30.040 --> 1:41:36.760]  and and then we buy a sub frequency on some Christian network or or a Mexican
[1:41:36.760 --> 1:41:41.480]  TV station and then people say we work for the Mexicans see because they play
[1:41:41.480 --> 1:41:47.040]  on the public's ignorance right okay and so the only company that because the
[1:41:47.040 --> 1:41:50.000]  satellites on the verge of it is in fact I think they already switched to another
[1:41:50.000 --> 1:41:56.360]  one yeah was ABC so we go with our little $5,000 right and we take weeks
[1:41:56.360 --> 1:41:59.040]  getting them on the phone we have to hook up the equipment and then of
[1:41:59.040 --> 1:42:02.440]  thousands of feeds gardening shows race car shows when you're listening to a
[1:42:02.440 --> 1:42:05.720]  baseball game from another state it's going over one of those three satellites
[1:42:05.720 --> 1:42:08.720]  just like if I call somebody in New York City it's probably going over a
[1:42:08.720 --> 1:42:13.760]  satellite yeah and see if I go to do it and call on an Apple phone on AT&T I'm
[1:42:13.760 --> 1:42:19.440]  not owned by AT&T so see or let's say there's let's say there's hundreds of
[1:42:19.440 --> 1:42:22.360]  corporations with Genesis in the name yeah which there are there's Genesis
[1:42:22.360 --> 1:42:27.440]  porno magazine and there's Genesis light bulbs and there's Genesis Ted
[1:42:27.440 --> 1:42:31.580]  Anderson incorporated in Minnesota anybody could check it it's it's
[1:42:31.580 --> 1:42:37.720]  Genesis broadcasting he set it up in 1998 I guess for 97 just info comes out
[1:42:37.720 --> 1:42:43.920]  and says there's a Genesis in Saudi Arabia and we're owned by that total
[1:42:43.920 --> 1:42:48.240]  line or there's a guy named Alex Jones who's 60 something years old with
[1:42:48.240 --> 1:42:53.680]  Scientology I'm him now or there's a billionaire named Alex Jones in Canada
[1:42:53.680 --> 1:43:01.680]  I'm supposedly him now there's Alex S. Jones on NPR I'm him now so see just
[1:43:01.680 --> 1:43:05.400]  like the internet can expose the big banks and the government it can also be
[1:43:05.400 --> 1:43:10.480]  used as a co-intel pro operation to make up all sorts of lies I mean they
[1:43:10.480 --> 1:43:14.760]  photoshopped my head on the on a Catholic priest outfit I'm Protestant and I'm
[1:43:14.760 --> 1:43:19.080]  there I am or they photoshopped my head on a woman and say there's Alex in drag
[1:43:19.080 --> 1:43:24.040]  and they say it like it's real or they photoshopped my head on something on on
[1:43:24.040 --> 1:43:29.040]  a Jewish man and put me in a Jewish wedding with a fat lady it's real it's
[1:43:29.040 --> 1:43:33.080]  proof and but see the real and in many of these cases it's not just haters or
[1:43:33.080 --> 1:43:37.440]  jealous people doing it's some of those some of it is I have actually confirmed
[1:43:37.440 --> 1:43:41.840]  and documented that it's been in newspapers we're tracked by the army we
[1:43:41.840 --> 1:43:46.440]  have informants following us with people trying to set us up we have them
[1:43:46.440 --> 1:43:50.560]  planting this info everywhere we had an Israeli diamond dealer run a five-year
[1:43:50.560 --> 1:43:57.080]  program saying I'm a Vatican killer you know oh yes I mean so and it all tracks
[1:43:57.080 --> 1:44:01.320]  back to government and so the key is you're asking me about this today so I'm
[1:44:01.320 --> 1:44:06.360]  talking about it yeah but the key is I ignore it I get on air and I say I know
[1:44:06.360 --> 1:44:09.160]  I'm good I know I'm real right 80% of the people
[1:44:09.160 --> 1:44:12.880]  conservative you talk to Alex Jones will come up Alex Jones will come up
[1:44:12.880 --> 1:44:17.920]  because Alex Jones 98% of the time stays on topic but 2% it's going to talk
[1:44:17.920 --> 1:44:22.960]  about this to educate people yeah Alex Jones stays focused Alex Jones says
[1:44:22.960 --> 1:44:26.160]  here's David Rockefeller's book where he says he wants world government here's
[1:44:26.160 --> 1:44:29.640]  helmet Schmidt he published men in power's political retrospective saying
[1:44:29.640 --> 1:44:33.160]  it here's Carol Quigley writing a book admitting world governments taking over
[1:44:33.160 --> 1:44:37.240]  and it's good for you here's the UN someone a world government to cut off your
[1:44:37.240 --> 1:44:40.360]  resources bankrupt you then they're gonna have CPS take your children and
[1:44:40.360 --> 1:44:44.800]  sterilize you here's 70 something government textbooks saying they want to
[1:44:44.800 --> 1:44:49.120]  poison the water to sterilize you here is all these peer reviewed reports that
[1:44:49.120 --> 1:44:53.200]  all these major GMO crops are sterilizing you then I have top genetic
[1:44:53.200 --> 1:44:57.000]  engineers involved in the development saying we told them this was sterilizing
[1:44:57.000 --> 1:45:01.120]  people and they said that's what we want there's too many people so what we do is
[1:45:01.120 --> 1:45:05.360]  it doesn't matter if I'm sacrificing myself to all the attacks because at
[1:45:05.360 --> 1:45:09.040]  another level the attacks just make me bigger I use their celebrity system
[1:45:09.040 --> 1:45:12.600]  against them because any publicity is good publicity right and then so even
[1:45:12.600 --> 1:45:15.640]  the attacks actually and I never knew this I just try to do the right thing
[1:45:15.640 --> 1:45:19.400]  yeah it turned out that doing right just always works it's invincible that's it's
[1:45:19.400 --> 1:45:22.920]  I mean if they kill me it's invincible if they put me in prison I only get bigger
[1:45:22.920 --> 1:45:27.080]  it's invincible if they torture me or put a fake video up me saying something
[1:45:27.080 --> 1:45:31.400]  people won't believe that it's invincible the truth lies have to be reapplied
[1:45:31.400 --> 1:45:35.920]  Dean over and over and over and over again right but the truth is powerful
[1:45:35.920 --> 1:45:39.800]  it's explosive you can't suppress it if you try it explodes with even more force
[1:45:39.800 --> 1:45:46.880]  truth has a just a a incredible dynamic-ness to it which is just cuts
[1:45:46.880 --> 1:45:50.520]  through the lies and the more lies you pile on it the more powerful it gets
[1:45:50.520 --> 1:45:55.120]  okay and also those who have discernment know I'm for real those that have
[1:45:55.120 --> 1:45:58.600]  discernment of research my facts those that have discernment have learned
[1:45:58.600 --> 1:46:02.640]  about the Cointel Pro tricks and now they understand and now they're wise to
[1:46:02.640 --> 1:46:06.280]  what's going on right and all this information you put it on your websites
[1:46:06.280 --> 1:46:09.800]  and all that absolutely anybody can access all of this stuff that you get
[1:46:09.800 --> 1:46:14.560]  yes yes everything we get everything everything wow and so you never find
[1:46:14.560 --> 1:46:22.240]  that then as you're getting closer to what is a universal single truth that as
[1:46:22.240 --> 1:46:26.160]  the lies pile on you know you're getting closer yes oh it's getting worse every
[1:46:26.160 --> 1:46:30.120]  day is it really absolutely is it coming to a head where predict the future
[1:46:30.120 --> 1:46:34.960]  what how do you see this all I just hope it gets worse that right yeah why is
[1:46:34.960 --> 1:46:40.760]  that because because all the hit pieces only bring people to me and then
[1:46:40.760 --> 1:46:44.720]  they're gonna hear me say they're taking your babies blood for 37 years at birth
[1:46:44.720 --> 1:46:49.840]  and putting it in a UN biological weapons laboratory and I had the
[1:46:49.840 --> 1:46:53.200]  documents I had the congressman I had members of the Parliament of Australia
[1:46:53.200 --> 1:46:57.880]  on exposing it 12 years ago and they hear me talk about it people won't go
[1:46:57.880 --> 1:47:01.200]  check the document out they won't even go to info wars comm and now they hear
[1:47:01.200 --> 1:47:04.120]  it on their news everywhere going yeah we're taking your blood has been going
[1:47:04.120 --> 1:47:10.040]  on for 37 years globally for your own good and people go whoa see more more
[1:47:10.040 --> 1:47:13.680]  often than not I go oh here's 10 articles today calling for all government
[1:47:13.680 --> 1:47:18.120]  saying how good it is oh here's a bill calling for FEMA camps for your safety
[1:47:18.120 --> 1:47:22.000]  I told you they would call for it for your safety yeah see they wouldn't come
[1:47:22.000 --> 1:47:25.360]  out and say oh it's an evil FEMA camp right so see I know their whole I mean I
[1:47:25.360 --> 1:47:29.040]  was able to say exactly what Glenn Beck would do with his debunking of FEMA
[1:47:29.040 --> 1:47:34.080]  camps with total precision weeks before he did it because I understand the
[1:47:34.080 --> 1:47:40.480]  enemy's mind hmm that's incredible actually and it's also you know I hear
[1:47:40.480 --> 1:47:44.920]  that and I'm frightened and then that fear is what's actually working against
[1:47:44.920 --> 1:47:48.080]  me because that's what they're trying to do they're trying to when one stairs
[1:47:48.080 --> 1:47:52.960]  into the abyss be careful you don't turn into the abyss but the good news is I
[1:47:52.960 --> 1:47:56.440]  have turned into the abyss but I'm still a good guy and have my humanity but I
[1:47:56.440 --> 1:48:02.600]  am now literally psychologically mentally I am able to anytime I want look
[1:48:02.600 --> 1:48:06.280]  into things with their perspective and their grand architecture so now I'm so
[1:48:06.280 --> 1:48:09.960]  high up in my study of it that I'm what they would call illuminated and I've
[1:48:09.960 --> 1:48:15.320]  had a lead us tell me that because now I am above the fog right I now see a
[1:48:15.320 --> 1:48:20.960]  thousand miles wow well thank you for that that's awesome how else I mean you
[1:48:20.960 --> 1:48:25.760]  did it and it seems that you have an incredible interior personal strength
[1:48:25.760 --> 1:48:30.320]  it's just other people need to rise up and do that as well if change will
[1:48:30.320 --> 1:48:34.160]  happen is that correct absolutely I mean what I love is reading Thomas
[1:48:34.160 --> 1:48:38.520]  Jefferson because what because I read the exact words I have already thought in
[1:48:38.520 --> 1:48:44.320]  my soul and see that's the thing the elite are awake and understand the way
[1:48:44.320 --> 1:48:47.480]  the universe operates and works understand the systems but they use it
[1:48:47.480 --> 1:48:52.040]  for evil the power is good people that's what they're scared of is actually
[1:48:52.040 --> 1:48:57.960]  awakening okay right to the larger system and that can happen for anyone
[1:48:57.960 --> 1:49:03.440]  any individual yes and how hard is that I mean it took you 14 years or when did
[1:49:03.440 --> 1:49:08.440]  this shift happen for you I always instinctively understood their programs
[1:49:08.440 --> 1:49:12.600]  and paradigms everyone actually does subconsciously the brain subconsciously
[1:49:12.600 --> 1:49:16.240]  they and in scientific experiments is thousands of times more popular
[1:49:16.240 --> 1:49:21.960]  thousands of times more powerful mm-hmm again the subconscious mind and major
[1:49:21.960 --> 1:49:24.920]  studies depending on what should he look at his hundreds to thousands of times
[1:49:24.920 --> 1:49:30.600]  more powerful than the conscious mind the conscious mind is a tiny focusing of
[1:49:30.600 --> 1:49:35.000]  the entire brainpower right the average person is an idiot savant and can do
[1:49:35.000 --> 1:49:39.760]  incredible mathematics and you know things like that they just have never
[1:49:39.760 --> 1:49:44.600]  discovered how to harness that so we all have gifts I'm nothing special mm-hmm
[1:49:44.600 --> 1:49:48.640]  okay it's just that I've studied them so long and really read so many of their
[1:49:48.640 --> 1:49:53.560]  own source documents their own manuals their own reports their own systems and
[1:49:53.560 --> 1:49:57.480]  then it just verifies what I already instinctively knew right and it's only
[1:49:57.480 --> 1:50:00.680]  been the last two or three years that I've learned to trust my overall
[1:50:00.680 --> 1:50:04.280]  understanding and instinct because so many times it's right but I still know I
[1:50:04.280 --> 1:50:07.840]  have blind spots I'm not you know all seeing or something it's just that the
[1:50:07.840 --> 1:50:12.280]  human brain is unbelievably powerful and I have learned how to start really
[1:50:12.280 --> 1:50:16.960]  tapping into that Wow that's pretty cool actually Wow that's awesome you know
[1:50:16.960 --> 1:50:21.560]  this is exactly as we do our documentary and we're going around and
[1:50:21.560 --> 1:50:26.240]  we're finding you know different people in the UFO world and stuff like that and
[1:50:26.240 --> 1:50:31.320]  and they all have their individual truths that they believe in that but it
[1:50:31.320 --> 1:50:35.320]  seems that you can sort of find a universal truth that I don't think we've
[1:50:35.320 --> 1:50:41.280]  found so far in this documentary well the one I mean I'll give you a big

[1:54:04.320 --> 1:54:10.560]  Dean Haglin is our guest in the studio and what the time is flying absolutely
[1:54:10.560 --> 1:54:15.720]  everything I cover is a hundred percent what I believe the truth to be right and
[1:54:15.720 --> 1:54:21.120]  I have an amazing track record of being about 95% accurate and over 95% of what
[1:54:21.120 --> 1:54:24.320]  we cover is from original source documents and statements or its media
[1:54:24.320 --> 1:54:29.840]  propaganda that that that we are analyzing but the big secret is I
[1:54:29.840 --> 1:54:35.840]  actually understand a lot more than I even say and I have my views and
[1:54:35.840 --> 1:54:40.320]  understanding on things that are seen as more archetypal conspiracy theories like
[1:54:40.320 --> 1:54:47.840]  UFOs you know spiritual issues things like that but I deliberately don't get
[1:54:47.840 --> 1:54:52.360]  into those things because I can't document them or prove them okay so I've
[1:54:52.360 --> 1:54:58.800]  done my own research on a wide range of things but I stick to what is real and
[1:54:58.800 --> 1:55:06.080]  tangible because if if if the Delta Force was doing drills in 96 97 98 99 yeah
[1:55:06.080 --> 1:55:11.200]  all over Texas renting buildings covertly blowing them up to scare the
[1:55:11.200 --> 1:55:15.160]  public doing psych warfare test I had emergency manager Thomas Sanchez on
[1:55:15.160 --> 1:55:18.600]  saying they told him it was for psych warfare it's since been declassified
[1:55:18.600 --> 1:55:22.680]  it's an acclimation process they've got Marines out running checkpoints for DUI
[1:55:22.680 --> 1:55:26.560]  sent for citizens saying what's wrong with the stopping drunks for a PR thing
[1:55:26.560 --> 1:55:30.120]  to get their foot in the door oh the army the Marines are here yeah getting
[1:55:30.120 --> 1:55:34.920]  rid of posse commentatus if I could if I couldn't get people when it was going
[1:55:34.920 --> 1:55:38.520]  on all over the country I mean anybody listings had these drills in their city
[1:55:38.520 --> 1:55:43.080]  it's happened everywhere but then the media would say it didn't happen I remember
[1:55:43.080 --> 1:55:45.640]  when they Delta Force crashed a helicopter in Houston they said it didn't
[1:55:45.640 --> 1:55:49.320]  happen on the news and then soldier a fortune did a big report exposing it so
[1:55:49.320 --> 1:55:53.760]  see if I can't get people to admit that in the health care bill it puts you in
[1:55:53.760 --> 1:55:57.080]  prison if you don't get health care when it's in the bill if I can't get people
[1:55:57.080 --> 1:56:00.480]  to read section 802 of the Patriot Act that states it's for all misdemeanors
[1:56:00.480 --> 1:56:03.480]  you know any action that endangers human life it's a violation any federal or
[1:56:03.480 --> 1:56:08.840]  state law then how am I going to get them how am I gonna be able to then get
[1:56:08.840 --> 1:56:15.280]  into other things you know that are more nebulous right be it spiritual or UFO or
[1:56:15.280 --> 1:56:21.440]  other world is that yeah what you mean so that you you you are focusing then
[1:56:21.440 --> 1:56:25.720]  your larger world picture into the stuff that you can actually get the
[1:56:25.720 --> 1:56:29.280]  documents that you can get that are sent to you all I'm trying to do is to get
[1:56:29.280 --> 1:56:32.400]  people to know it's bigger than Democrat Republican right it's bigger than
[1:56:32.400 --> 1:56:36.400]  black and white it's bigger than Europe and America and Asia and Africa and
[1:56:36.400 --> 1:56:40.680]  Latin America it's it's bigger than how we're all divided and conquered and
[1:56:40.680 --> 1:56:43.600]  played off against each other I just want people to know there's more out
[1:56:43.600 --> 1:56:49.360]  there there's more going on than you know and don't let the system get you
[1:56:49.360 --> 1:56:54.320]  frustrated and angry and upset it's fun to explore this it's fun I mean it's fun
[1:56:54.320 --> 1:56:59.760]  it's it's kind of fun when the media attacks me and lies about me it's is it
[1:56:59.760 --> 1:57:06.560]  you find that fun I've learned to make it fun and and and it it it really takes
[1:57:06.560 --> 1:57:10.560]  the wind out of their sails because I mean it really is almost a psychic thing
[1:57:10.560 --> 1:57:15.040]  with a stalker or the government or anybody else you know when the government
[1:57:15.040 --> 1:57:17.280]  used to death threaten me and do all this other stuff to me I would just say
[1:57:17.280 --> 1:57:20.960]  bring it on you know I don't want to die but I'm not afraid to and I'm just
[1:57:20.960 --> 1:57:24.120]  standing up for what's right and they just disappear like phantoms in the
[1:57:24.120 --> 1:57:27.480]  morning I remember last time we had dinner here in Austin two three years
[1:57:27.480 --> 1:57:31.360]  ago there was some corporation here that was threatening you saying we're on to
[1:57:31.360 --> 1:57:36.440]  you and do you remember that well I mean I can't confirm it was Dyncor but but
[1:57:36.440 --> 1:57:41.080]  Dyncor was in the congressional hearings Dyncor well it was admitted was
[1:57:41.080 --> 1:57:45.600]  running giant child kidnapping rings all over the world with the UN it was in
[1:57:45.600 --> 1:57:49.560]  major papers and I was getting very serious death threats over that right
[1:57:49.560 --> 1:57:56.760]  and then that you found fun well I mean I mean not just saying hey you're you're
[1:57:56.760 --> 1:58:02.440]  I mean they're scum they're evil I'm standing up against you and that means
[1:58:02.440 --> 1:58:05.640]  I'm hurting you that means I'm trying to bring you to justice that means I'm
[1:58:05.640 --> 1:58:10.120]  exposing you and so that truth will set you free it does it sets you free wow

[2:00:12.360 --> 2:00:19.880]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[2:00:19.880 --> 2:00:28.360]  Alex Jones chaos one more question that the whole concept of shoot the
[2:00:28.360 --> 2:00:32.760]  messenger you know that this is the idea that you are bringing this
[2:00:32.760 --> 2:00:36.160]  information and that people who are afraid of that or don't want to hear it
[2:00:36.160 --> 2:00:44.480]  attack you but what's your position how do you handle that well I get on the
[2:00:44.480 --> 2:00:48.000]  highway every day even though it's the number one cause of death until you had
[2:00:48.000 --> 2:00:52.240]  about 55 minutes cancer and heart attacks I put my children in my car I
[2:00:52.240 --> 2:00:57.400]  seat belt them in and try to drive safe but still I mean I'm I'm I mean I'm
[2:00:57.400 --> 2:01:01.960]  endangering their lives but that's the danger that goes on everyday life so why
[2:01:01.960 --> 2:01:07.920]  wouldn't I take a tax why wouldn't I take physical danger why wouldn't I put
[2:01:07.920 --> 2:01:11.800]  myself at risk for liberty and freedom and the adventure of knowing the truth
[2:01:11.800 --> 2:01:17.480]  and standing up for the little guy who's being abused and I'll go back to what I
[2:01:17.480 --> 2:01:21.960]  said earlier so many things I've talked about have come true so many times when
[2:01:21.960 --> 2:01:26.880]  I come out first on day one and say 9-11's an inside job and lose more than
[2:01:26.880 --> 2:01:32.120]  half the radio stations I was on within a couple weeks I didn't feel bad when my
[2:01:32.120 --> 2:01:36.480]  paycheck went way down and all that I told the truth I had honor I was for real
[2:01:36.480 --> 2:01:41.560]  when all these so-called other at you know people and activists I've seen them
[2:01:41.560 --> 2:01:47.640]  all sell out for a bag of peanuts you know to me telling the truth is what's
[2:01:47.640 --> 2:01:51.600]  truly honorable and then and then being successful doing it my way you know that
[2:01:51.600 --> 2:01:56.840]  makes it that much better there's no blood on my hands and so I really feel
[2:01:56.840 --> 2:02:00.360]  good and I'm trying to teach other people how to have courage and stand up
[2:02:00.360 --> 2:02:03.760]  against tyranny and that doesn't mean that they have to all have my view or
[2:02:03.760 --> 2:02:09.080]  my idea one of the few painful things but I've even learned to understand that
[2:02:09.080 --> 2:02:13.000]  that you're gonna cast seeds out and some are gonna fall on the rocks some are
[2:02:13.000 --> 2:02:18.040]  gonna fall in the water some are gonna fall into the good dirt but not sprout
[2:02:18.040 --> 2:02:21.080]  yeah it's a very small percentage that are gonna get into the dirt and really
[2:02:21.080 --> 2:02:25.760]  grow into you know beautiful oak trees and so I'm throwing out all this seed
[2:02:25.760 --> 2:02:29.000]  I've woken up conservatively probably a hundred million people worldwide my
[2:02:29.000 --> 2:02:32.720]  films have been seen more than 200 million times online that we know of
[2:02:32.720 --> 2:02:36.080]  right for free on the media can never understand that when I tell them that
[2:02:36.080 --> 2:02:40.240]  it's free it's free because I want the people to wake up right the globalist
[2:02:40.240 --> 2:02:44.480]  traffic in the men's of souls the globalist traffic in the souls of men
[2:02:44.480 --> 2:02:50.880]  and and and and I traffic in trying to save those souls from being pre-programmed
[2:02:50.880 --> 2:02:56.760]  and never really flourishing and so I can't expect it that if I wake up a
[2:02:56.760 --> 2:02:59.920]  bunch of people some of them are gonna go off and do bad things some of them
[2:02:59.920 --> 2:03:02.680]  are gonna do good things some of them are gonna do great things some of them
[2:03:02.680 --> 2:03:06.080]  are gonna do nothing some of them are gonna turn against me and and become
[2:03:06.080 --> 2:03:10.160]  agents of evil and agents of weakness and agents of corruption and agents of
[2:03:10.160 --> 2:03:16.800]  greed but that's the way it works and so I feel sadness for them just like I feel
[2:03:16.800 --> 2:03:20.360]  sadness for the public who will never hear this message of truth or will hear
[2:03:20.360 --> 2:03:23.680]  it and dust themselves off and they've been hit by the truth and you know keep
[2:03:23.680 --> 2:03:29.800]  on walking down the road as as Churchill said everybody gets run in
[2:03:29.800 --> 2:03:33.840]  everyone runs into the truth in their life at one time or another but most
[2:03:33.840 --> 2:03:37.960]  people get knocked over by it get up dust themselves off I didn't do that and
[2:03:37.960 --> 2:03:42.520]  so I've been awake since I was a child to the wonder to the majesty to the
[2:03:42.520 --> 2:03:48.040]  magic of the world and I think it's because I had that poetic loving heart
[2:03:48.040 --> 2:03:54.240]  that I was able early on to also see the bad it's because I see the good and the
[2:03:54.240 --> 2:03:58.680]  beauty and the innocence and the honor and everything pure that I'm also able
[2:03:58.680 --> 2:04:03.080]  to then see the things that are dark and degenerate and dangerous and aberrant
[2:04:03.080 --> 2:04:07.400]  and bad and look into that abyss as you said earlier yes look into that abyss
[2:04:07.400 --> 2:04:11.360]  wow that's fascinating so you can balance the two and that without the one
[2:04:11.360 --> 2:04:16.080]  you wouldn't have the other absolutely right wow well thank you so much that's
[2:04:16.080 --> 2:04:21.120]  awesome we can't it's very inspiring actually because I know times where even
[2:04:21.120 --> 2:04:25.720]  I'll just be like you know it seems overwhelming all this information well
[2:04:25.720 --> 2:04:30.000]  that's the system trying to crush your humanity trying to overwhelm you trying
[2:04:30.000 --> 2:04:34.080]  to it's called learned helplessness they've done it with dogs and rats and
[2:04:34.080 --> 2:04:38.040]  other mammals where they shock them and torture them in a cage every time they
[2:04:38.040 --> 2:04:41.120]  try to get their food they get shocked they just give up go in the corner and
[2:04:41.120 --> 2:04:46.880]  die no we're not a dog or a rat trapped in a cage we can break out of the cage
[2:04:46.880 --> 2:04:51.880]  and go against our controllers the whole world is a giant mad scientist
[2:04:51.880 --> 2:04:55.520]  laboratory where they're trying to harness and dominate and dehumanize
[2:04:55.520 --> 2:04:59.680]  humanity because they're threatened by that dynamic human spirit they ate it

[2:08:05.680 --> 2:08:10.640]  show because there's a war on for your mind
[2:08:20.600 --> 2:08:26.520]  it's just highly intuitive everybody is Dean Haglin final segment Bob Chapman
[2:08:26.520 --> 2:08:30.880]  coming up here in just a few minutes see Dean also have the long view of history
[2:08:30.880 --> 2:08:37.080]  right I know that I could get killed set up jail destroyed the media doesn't
[2:08:37.080 --> 2:08:40.800]  matter I did my work I've woken up a bunch of people I've gotten them to think
[2:08:40.800 --> 2:08:44.840]  outside the box many of the terms that I developed describe the planet are now
[2:08:44.840 --> 2:08:48.520]  in common use and I'm not even credited with most of it people are using it
[2:08:48.520 --> 2:08:53.520]  another example of the human potential human power that everybody has and so I
[2:08:53.520 --> 2:08:57.240]  know whether it's 10 years 20 years 30 years on the road my work will just
[2:08:57.240 --> 2:09:03.720]  continue on if even I the image or or the you know an icon of this is destroyed
[2:09:03.720 --> 2:09:09.680]  because it'll just be reborn later and and so so it's that unselfishness that
[2:09:09.680 --> 2:09:13.560]  conquers evil and it's also recognizing there is evil you know there is
[2:09:13.560 --> 2:09:17.520]  corruption right there are psychopaths that see death and destruction a pile of
[2:09:17.520 --> 2:09:21.320]  dead bodies is beautiful you and I think a Colorado vista and snow capped
[2:09:21.320 --> 2:09:25.720]  mountains and a beautiful woman you know with us that we're you know having a
[2:09:25.720 --> 2:09:29.400]  great day together and a glass of wine and you know happiness and fields of
[2:09:29.400 --> 2:09:35.200]  flowers and driving past happy happy you know farmhouses and orchards that
[2:09:35.200 --> 2:09:40.000]  buoys our soul but the but the criminal psychopath the high-functioning
[2:09:40.000 --> 2:09:45.840]  sadistic psychopath they enjoy domination control in fact I want to read
[2:09:45.840 --> 2:09:50.760]  this on air for your piece and you guys print me the two Orwell passages that I
[2:09:50.760 --> 2:09:57.800]  read earlier in the week can you guys dig them up one of the one of it and if
[2:09:57.800 --> 2:10:01.560]  we can't find it now I will read it outside during a break to you guys okay
[2:10:01.560 --> 2:10:08.040]  where we describe the enemy where O'Brien is torturing Winston yeah and
[2:10:08.040 --> 2:10:14.760]  just just 1984 priest of power will pull it up that'll give you the passages
[2:10:14.760 --> 2:10:23.320]  also 1984 trampling and being trampled on right see because to them it's all
[2:10:23.320 --> 2:10:29.200]  about power it's just the continued triumph the the the domination of
[2:10:29.200 --> 2:10:34.440]  goodness the the evil society working together because all that's good to them
[2:10:34.440 --> 2:10:38.040]  is very ugly right and so they're seeking to tear it down and destroy it
[2:10:38.040 --> 2:10:42.720]  and that's from fear is that what is or is it just the psychopathic mind well
[2:10:42.720 --> 2:10:46.160]  they do have a lot of fearful control freaks that also serve them but at the
[2:10:46.160 --> 2:10:53.600]  very top they they're their psychos and a lot of psychopathic tendencies are in
[2:10:53.600 --> 2:10:57.240]  families and you have a lot of elites in breeding when you have in breeding
[2:10:57.240 --> 2:11:01.640]  psychopathic tendencies megalomania tends to manifest you notice these elite
[2:11:01.640 --> 2:11:04.800]  families have been in breeding for centuries in Europe thousands of years
[2:11:04.800 --> 2:11:10.560]  total and so they are a different group of people in many respects from the
[2:11:10.560 --> 2:11:15.000]  general population now well that's sad cuz I come from Swedish royalty myself
[2:11:15.000 --> 2:11:21.960]  and I shouldn't perhaps let everyone know that that's in my system so but
[2:11:21.960 --> 2:11:27.120]  thanks again you know there's been some good kings to yeah yeah a couple but we
[2:11:27.120 --> 2:11:31.960]  can trace our the Haglin family line goes back to King Eric the 14th who was
[2:11:31.960 --> 2:11:37.520]  yeah he was I think I think most of us who are have got European ancestors I
[2:11:37.520 --> 2:11:42.200]  mean almost everybody out there has quite a bit of those because there's been
[2:11:42.200 --> 2:11:46.280]  so many other royal houses and Germany had something like 20 different
[2:11:46.280 --> 2:11:50.640]  principalities in it each one had a you know had a king over it right right and
[2:11:50.640 --> 2:11:54.320]  there's smaller and smaller empires absolutely I mean I I mean you know I
[2:11:54.320 --> 2:11:59.360]  had the it's ridiculous if you look at my family line how many people but I mean
[2:11:59.360 --> 2:12:04.480]  I've got a lot of ancestors from England yeah but you know German royals but
[2:12:04.480 --> 2:12:08.640]  that's all a dime a dozen I mean I mean everybody everybody's related to those
[2:12:08.640 --> 2:12:13.520]  people of the European mm-hmm and and most most groups I mean most people who
[2:12:13.520 --> 2:12:17.360]  are from Mexico I guarantee you have got some bloodline going back to Aztec
[2:12:17.360 --> 2:12:21.800]  Kings all right I mean if you study bloodlines it's like my mom's side of
[2:12:21.800 --> 2:12:27.440]  the family two people in the Mayflower my dad's side directly to Captain Jones and
[2:12:27.440 --> 2:12:31.360]  just goes on that's where the Jones names come from from Captain Jones yeah
[2:12:31.360 --> 2:12:35.240]  Explorer you know you could trace it all the way back yeah wow now it's pretty
[2:12:35.240 --> 2:12:39.800]  cool it's odd that you're now exploring still I think all humans explore though
[2:12:39.800 --> 2:12:44.680]  Dean oh really I'm finding some that don't actually well I mean there are some
[2:12:44.680 --> 2:12:48.160]  people well they want to explore the football scores yeah they want to
[2:12:48.160 --> 2:12:52.480]  explore the topless bars they want to explore me I mean I want to explore the
[2:12:52.480 --> 2:12:55.280]  mysteries of the world mm-hmm the mysteries of the universe well yeah and
[2:12:55.280 --> 2:13:01.040]  you certainly have on this show do we have Bob Chapman okay good we asked him
[2:13:01.040 --> 2:13:04.360]  to call in at 15 I just want to make sure Dean I wanted to talk about you

[2:13:48.800 --> 2:13:54.320]  actually I can't find my 1984 stuff that I was reading earlier in the week it's
[2:13:54.320 --> 2:13:59.680]  the trampled and being trampled on the getting it we're getting it the problem
[2:13:59.680 --> 2:14:03.480]  is I had so much stuff this is like I know this is one day of stuff this is
[2:14:03.480 --> 2:14:06.200]  just one day this is one day well those magazines have been there for about a
[2:14:06.200 --> 2:14:10.680]  month but no all of this all I mean this is just look yeah yeah this is just a
[2:14:10.680 --> 2:14:15.800]  smattering of one trip to the grocery store falling fertility how population
[2:14:15.800 --> 2:14:19.680]  problem is solving itself that's just in the economy and economists and it says
[2:14:19.680 --> 2:14:23.360]  fertility is falling astonishingly fast and that's bringing big benefits less
[2:14:23.360 --> 2:14:27.880]  people's good here they are saying the heir of the Rothschild fortune is the
[2:14:27.880 --> 2:14:34.280]  hero gene and it says that he may be basically Jesus good guy and then it
[2:14:34.280 --> 2:14:39.440]  says Al Gore's an eco-profit and you know stuff like that and then and then
[2:14:39.440 --> 2:14:43.440]  they've got our heroes for us not people to stand up against tyranny no it's got
[2:14:43.440 --> 2:14:48.320]  to be Colt McCoy yeah so see I mean you know just a just a quick quick
[2:14:48.320 --> 2:14:52.920]  smattering there outside magazine talking about the hero gene and that this
[2:14:52.920 --> 2:14:56.400]  is rather shocking I thought you have to find this in much more obscure
[2:14:56.400 --> 2:15:00.600]  publications no it's just they have billboards up when we were in Los
[2:15:00.600 --> 2:15:06.160]  Angeles doing some interviews and I'm just worshiping David the Rothschild he's
[2:15:06.160 --> 2:15:09.360]  just gonna save us we're gonna pay our carbon taxes directly to him he owns
[2:15:09.360 --> 2:15:12.960]  one of the major carbon trading systems oh you're kidding isn't he gracious to
[2:15:12.960 --> 2:15:17.280]  save us that's amazing and by the way when he was on my radio show because
[2:15:17.280 --> 2:15:21.080]  people can get these big folks on that Alex get him on that's another big
[2:15:21.080 --> 2:15:24.720]  conspiracy well he had a book for kids teaching them that polar bears were
[2:15:24.720 --> 2:15:27.760]  drowning literally and then we had to have a global carbon tax and he would
[2:15:27.760 --> 2:15:31.800]  save us that the public school system was buying for kids so we call up the
[2:15:31.800 --> 2:15:35.320]  publisher and we go we're a large syndicated radio show we'd like to have
[2:15:35.320 --> 2:15:38.520]  you on about your book and so they have him lined up in interviews all day yeah
[2:15:38.520 --> 2:15:40.920]  he's supposed to come on for 10 minutes but I challenged him he was on for about
[2:15:40.920 --> 2:15:50.480]  45 and and and he was so arrogant Dean he was so arrogant to everybody that
[2:15:50.480 --> 2:15:54.640]  he would say number one there's no plan on carbon taxes that that's a
[2:15:54.640 --> 2:15:57.520]  conspiracy then two years later he came out and said it was good we all needed
[2:15:57.520 --> 2:16:02.320]  taxes the carbon tax and and then I said well why are the ice caps on Mars
[2:16:02.320 --> 2:16:06.360]  melting and why are some of the moons of Jupiter and Saturn melting that were
[2:16:06.360 --> 2:16:09.920]  liquid methane and other things yeah and he said oh because they're now closer
[2:16:09.920 --> 2:16:16.000]  to the Sun they're closer to the Sun than the earth and I said no it goes
[2:16:16.000 --> 2:16:21.880]  Mercury Venus earth Mars and then out to the gas giants yeah all the way out to
[2:16:21.880 --> 2:16:28.120]  Pluto and he just said no that's not true and laughed it's a it's in his
[2:16:28.120 --> 2:16:33.280]  religion it's about the religion of the elite yeah it's about contempt for the
[2:16:33.280 --> 2:16:37.680]  general population it's about thinking my audience was so dumb that he would
[2:16:37.680 --> 2:16:41.680]  come on and say no the ice caps are melting because those planets are
[2:16:41.680 --> 2:16:47.240]  closer to the Sun than the earth wow but even if he meant that no planets have
[2:16:47.240 --> 2:16:51.320]  gotten closer to the Sun well then that's also was making the earth hotter
[2:16:51.320 --> 2:16:55.640]  but but in truth the Sun had just heated up it's the main giver of heat and life
[2:16:55.640 --> 2:17:00.520]  right some you know underground magma touching the ocean and coming out that
[2:17:00.520 --> 2:17:04.960]  that creates some geothermal but but most of it right I mean literally billions
[2:17:04.960 --> 2:17:08.360]  of times more in the equations I've seen comes from the Sun yeah and and they
[2:17:08.360 --> 2:17:12.600]  say no that's a conspiracy theory and the IPCC at the UN that runs this whole
[2:17:12.600 --> 2:17:18.920]  global warming fraud they openly say that it's a conspiracy theory to say
[2:17:18.920 --> 2:17:22.520]  the Sun affects earth temperature you pull up the headlines right now
[2:17:22.520 --> 2:17:27.880]  Google this UN says Sun not affecting climate and you will get them
[2:17:27.880 --> 2:17:32.800]  announcing they say Dean the Sun doesn't affect when the earth tilted towards
[2:17:32.800 --> 2:17:38.640]  the Sun you get summer no that's not no that's geothermal work yes it's your
[2:17:38.640 --> 2:17:44.000]  breath you did it Dean you're bad I shouldn't be exhaling listen there were
[2:17:44.000 --> 2:17:47.240]  only 20 something thousand two decades ago polar bears which are still a large
[2:17:47.240 --> 2:17:50.360]  population yeah and all the major archaeological study they've done show
[2:17:50.360 --> 2:17:53.920]  that when it does heat up there's more of them okay because they almost die in
[2:17:53.920 --> 2:17:57.840]  the winter and then they only eat during the summer so the warmer it is and it
[2:17:57.840 --> 2:18:00.200]  was getting a little bit warmer for a while it's a natural up and down cycle
[2:18:00.200 --> 2:18:03.000]  they were they were doing a lot better now unfortunately it's getting colder
[2:18:03.000 --> 2:18:06.360]  again so the population of polar bears will start going down according to the
[2:18:06.360 --> 2:18:10.760]  historical record but they just tell people no I mean my son has textbooks
[2:18:10.760 --> 2:18:14.560]  and stuff that say the polar bears are all dying Dean and they're dying because
[2:18:14.560 --> 2:18:19.600]  of the global warming and they say penguins can't swim I'm not kidding
[2:18:19.600 --> 2:18:25.400]  really they say penguins are gonna drown they're they're well it's an aquatic
[2:18:25.400 --> 2:18:28.880]  bird it's a quagga bird I saw March of the penguins they they don't do very well
[2:18:28.880 --> 2:18:32.720]  on land it seems no they have contest in public schools I was even done in
[2:18:32.720 --> 2:18:36.160]  Port Iran's at a pizza place on the wall they had a little kids pictures they
[2:18:36.160 --> 2:18:39.320]  drawn saying please save the penguins they're gonna drown and I mean they had
[2:18:39.320 --> 2:18:44.600]  the kids all do that and the kids love penguins yeah absolutely wow wow it
[2:18:44.600 --> 2:18:49.400]  just never ends does it so tell us what TV shows you're doing right now you will

[2:18:56.200 --> 2:18:59.640]  conspiracy show sort of like Jesse Venture is a little a little more fun
[2:18:59.640 --> 2:19:04.440]  though I love Jesse show but he's coming at it a bit you're doing a
[2:19:04.440 --> 2:19:07.960]  conspiracy show for what it's yeah we're looking to get it on Discovery
[2:19:07.960 --> 2:19:11.320]  Channel I'm also this is or this is separate is a separate thing this is
[2:19:11.320 --> 2:19:16.560]  gonna be for theatrical and DVD release but it'll be another show similar to
[2:19:16.560 --> 2:19:20.560]  that where I explore these kind of things gonna come interviews I would love
[2:19:20.560 --> 2:19:24.400]  to if you have me absolutely my only issue is Discovery Channel did a five
[2:19:24.400 --> 2:19:28.000]  part series with me and shelved it because it was too hardcore like Ventura's
[2:19:28.000 --> 2:19:30.800]  oh really they're gonna want you to look into Chewbacca brothers and stuff yeah
[2:19:30.800 --> 2:19:35.800]  yeah all sorts of stuff I went and looked with Dr. Roger Lear at some alien
[2:19:35.800 --> 2:19:40.480]  implants that he had removed some next episode vampires episode after that
[2:19:40.480 --> 2:19:45.000]  Loch Ness Monster yeah and then Net Yeti the abominable snowman maybe some of

[2:21:31.920 --> 2:21:36.320]  forcing us to pay taxes to service the debt is this capitalism or was Jefferson
[2:21:36.320 --> 2:21:39.960]  correct when he said a central bank issuing a public currency is a greater
[2:21:39.960 --> 2:21:44.040]  menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army hi Ted Anderson

[2:22:06.400 --> 2:22:11.920]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that
[2:22:11.920 --> 2:22:14.880]  we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home
[2:22:14.880 --> 2:22:19.960]  tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling
[2:22:19.960 --> 2:22:25.240]  the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[2:22:25.240 --> 2:22:29.760]  attention for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal

[2:24:11.200 --> 2:24:15.560]  Dean Haglin is here with us for a minute or two left he told me is it okay to
[2:24:15.560 --> 2:24:19.360]  talk about the production company now I'm not gonna do it I'm not gonna do it
[2:24:19.360 --> 2:24:23.880]  later yeah I'm not gonna do it I just I just watch your six there buddy but man
[2:24:23.880 --> 2:24:26.560]  you're doing so much you're doing a bunch of TV shows movies I mean you're
[2:24:26.560 --> 2:24:29.640]  busy I'm very busy yeah there's a lot of independent stuff I just shot a movie
[2:24:29.640 --> 2:24:33.960]  called Atlantis down but the space shuttle shot that so that'll be coming out
[2:24:33.960 --> 2:24:38.880]  this year a couple of other you know these independent productions Hollywood
[2:24:38.880 --> 2:24:42.120]  is changing the way it's doing business there's a shifting sand going on there
[2:24:42.120 --> 2:24:45.640]  what you think of Ventura's television show I liked it a lot and it's great to
[2:24:45.640 --> 2:24:50.960]  see you on it I think it's great the way his research team actually follows the
[2:24:50.960 --> 2:24:54.480]  research so they'll follow it down the rabbit hole which a lot of shows didn't
[2:24:54.480 --> 2:24:57.960]  do almost like Perry Mason kind of like Perry Mason were you were you uncover
[2:24:57.960 --> 2:25:03.320]  layer after layer of an onion to get to the to something you know got top
[2:25:03.320 --> 2:25:07.320]  ratings on true TV is that right I think he's great I mean sometimes he seems to
[2:25:07.320 --> 2:25:10.840]  be coming in with like his mind already set and then he just finds the
[2:25:10.840 --> 2:25:14.240]  information yeah but that's the first time it's been from our perspective it's
[2:25:14.240 --> 2:25:17.640]  true no I was behind the scenes Ventura would really go check it out
[2:25:17.640 --> 2:25:21.160]  I mean Maury strong really does want to destroy civilization he says that the
[2:25:21.160 --> 2:25:25.360]  global warming is a fraud they already exposed the fraud before climate even
[2:25:25.360 --> 2:25:30.240]  came out and got Bill Sander to admit the UN frauds fudge the reports really so
[2:25:30.240 --> 2:25:35.720]  so that's great to hear but yeah you know I often think oh I'm I'm got access
[2:25:35.720 --> 2:25:39.480]  because I was in the government I got access to all sorts of no Ventura but
[2:25:39.480 --> 2:25:43.000]  a Ventura four years ago was arguing with me was he about this stuff you know
[2:25:43.000 --> 2:25:46.200]  he really went out and checked it out he believed global warming at the start of
[2:25:46.200 --> 2:25:50.680]  the episode oh yeah that's right and then I mean that's real they really sit
[2:25:50.680 --> 2:25:53.800]  around screaming at each other I've been in that room is that right yeah I don't
[2:25:53.800 --> 2:25:56.560]  know any of those other researchers on that they just sit around screaming at
[2:25:56.560 --> 2:25:59.800]  each other one of them is his son who's one of the guys that woke him up oh yeah
[2:25:59.800 --> 2:26:03.680]  I mean that that's real I mean you know they have some stuff where you know we
[2:26:03.680 --> 2:26:06.400]  gotta have a different shot let's not have this all in your office here we'll
[2:26:06.400 --> 2:26:09.440]  do it down the street at this warehouse yeah we're talking talk to Jesse with
[2:26:09.440 --> 2:26:13.040]  a different backdrop but it's really me talking to Jesse yeah I mean it's all it's
[2:26:13.040 --> 2:26:15.920]  real that stuff all happened and they must have a hell of a budget because
[2:26:15.920 --> 2:26:20.120]  everybody's flying all over the world on different planes they seem to be doing
[2:26:20.120 --> 2:26:24.800]  very well for a group I like it though I'm gonna continue watching for sure well
[2:26:24.800 --> 2:26:28.440]  Dean I'm gonna go to Bob Chapman but it was really wonderful having you yeah
[2:26:28.440 --> 2:26:32.600]  I'm gonna come out during a break and ran out this 1984 quote to you thank you

[2:26:38.760 --> 2:26:41.600]  called the truth is out there that's right thanks so much I mean great
[2:26:41.600 --> 2:26:45.680]  seeing you Batman take care good seeing you man what a great guy are you around
[2:26:45.680 --> 2:26:49.480]  this evening uh yeah actually my sons are today I'm taking him to get him a
[2:26:49.480 --> 2:26:54.000]  new bike he's gotten bigger bicycle but maybe if you're around this evening we
[2:26:54.000 --> 2:26:56.600]  can actually go out and get a bite to eat or something something that'd be cool
[2:26:56.600 --> 2:27:00.880]  I got a couple things to do but I you know what's fine we can are you here
[2:27:00.880 --> 2:27:03.880]  tomorrow I'm here tomorrow as well but we'll see what happens okay man see you
[2:27:03.880 --> 2:27:08.160]  bro take care see you out there okay Bob Chapman I apologize for but I know
[2:27:08.160 --> 2:27:11.680]  you're a busy fellow doing research in mind sitting there for 15 minutes good
[2:27:11.680 --> 2:27:14.440]  to have Bob Chapman with us right now Bob what's so what's going on in the
[2:27:14.440 --> 2:27:21.480]  world well our president today address the Republican retreat as it's called
[2:27:21.480 --> 2:27:25.400]  and the results were that the Republicans weren't all that happy about
[2:27:25.400 --> 2:27:31.880]  what he had to say and again I think like he did the other night in the state of
[2:27:31.880 --> 2:27:39.320]  the union address went purely political with a look toward a mind toward next
[2:27:39.320 --> 2:27:45.200]  November and and I think that's a mistake for him I think he would have
[2:27:45.200 --> 2:27:49.000]  been better off in both instances waltzing down the middle and trying to
[2:27:49.000 --> 2:27:54.440]  be a populist but they must have some fierce hold on him and he's still
[2:27:54.440 --> 2:27:59.400]  striking out for his programs which I think are doomed with the exception of
[2:27:59.400 --> 2:28:06.680]  of the increase in short term I will call it debt to which they rammed through I
[2:28:06.680 --> 2:28:13.680]  think it was yesterday I increased it from like 12.1 to 14.5 trillion or
[2:28:13.680 --> 2:28:19.480]  something like that and that's another $25,000 ahead for Americans to pay
[2:28:19.480 --> 2:28:30.360]  back but I think that a lot of what it went on today had to do with the
[2:28:30.360 --> 2:28:36.400]  ability of Congress to pass some measures would have which it would increase
[2:28:36.400 --> 2:28:42.600]  employment and he talked about the credits to be given to business for
[2:28:42.600 --> 2:28:49.200]  hiring people and that sort of thing which he was forced to do and he wants
[2:28:49.200 --> 2:28:54.960]  to make it look like it's a Democrat program again politics as opposed to
[2:28:54.960 --> 2:29:02.360]  helping the people he intends to help the people but politics come first which
[2:29:02.360 --> 2:29:09.920]  they shouldn't and and so the reason he did that is that both parties have
[2:29:09.920 --> 2:29:15.960]  plans which are relatively similar and so he wants to put the stamp of the
[2:29:15.960 --> 2:29:20.120]  Democratic Party on it and that's I think what it was really all about
[2:29:20.120 --> 2:29:24.320]  absolutely when we come back I want to really try to give you the floor with
[2:29:24.320 --> 2:29:28.840]  just simple questions on the economy Soros is saying he wants to kill gold
[2:29:28.840 --> 2:29:35.040]  saying it's a bubble your take on that the fact that they reconfirmed Bernanke
[2:29:35.040 --> 2:29:39.480]  but that Geithner's on the verge of being indicted and being told to step down
[2:29:39.480 --> 2:29:44.400]  that is coming up as well with Bob Chapman the international forecaster

[2:33:16.000 --> 2:33:22.560]  Bob Shatman is our guest as he is every Friday and in the third hour Bob again
[2:33:22.560 --> 2:33:27.000]  thank you for joining us Obama is in free fall are you concerned about the
[2:33:27.000 --> 2:33:31.520]  danger of him now staging terror attacks or a new war to try to get his
[2:33:31.520 --> 2:33:34.720]  approval ratings up I mean that's the that's what they always go to in their
[2:33:34.720 --> 2:33:40.480]  playbook I don't know most circumstances I'd say yes but and I think in his case
[2:33:40.480 --> 2:33:48.400]  no and the reason why to me is that they have to have better reasons than that to
[2:33:48.400 --> 2:33:54.280]  do a false flag operation or a 9-11 or something like that these people are so
[2:33:54.280 --> 2:34:01.680]  easily replaceable you know it's like we we saw a guide not arrogantly and and
[2:34:01.680 --> 2:34:06.840]  it's so it's so much fits the personality and the same kind of
[2:34:06.840 --> 2:34:12.440]  experience that you had when you talked to Mr. Rothschild they think they're
[2:34:12.440 --> 2:34:18.200]  above it all they're in a plane that we cannot approach we're just a bunch of
[2:34:18.200 --> 2:34:24.320]  animals upon earth for them to herd around and you know you you get this
[2:34:24.320 --> 2:34:31.680]  this dreadful example of what they shouldn't be doing in front of the
[2:34:31.680 --> 2:34:36.720]  public but they do it anyway and and I guess they they just can't help
[2:34:36.720 --> 2:34:42.720]  themselves like creamer saying that there's there's an Illuminati did you
[2:34:42.720 --> 2:34:52.440]  see that tape absolutely unbelievable I mean it did he mess up but anyway what
[2:34:52.440 --> 2:34:59.360]  we're looking at is a president that be can be replaced in in in a light
[2:34:59.360 --> 2:35:08.400]  second and I just don't feel that his waning proper popularity would bring
[2:35:08.400 --> 2:35:13.960]  that about they have to be more serious plans to do things than that because they
[2:35:13.960 --> 2:35:18.720]  can replace these guys in five seconds just like the the fight over Brunanke
[2:35:18.720 --> 2:35:22.080]  which was passed and he's going to continue to be the chairman of the
[2:35:22.080 --> 2:35:27.480]  Federal Reserve if it wasn't him it'd be up some other goat that they would put
[2:35:27.480 --> 2:35:31.040]  in this place and say look this is what you do and it will arrange for you to
[2:35:31.040 --> 2:35:35.160]  live happily ever after and it's the same thing with the president of the
[2:35:35.160 --> 2:35:40.960]  United States you know if it isn't working well well all of a sudden what
[2:35:40.960 --> 2:35:45.720]  will happen is that they'll say look you tried and it didn't work and so we're
[2:35:45.720 --> 2:35:51.720]  going to find out that you're not an American citizen it much simpler
[2:35:51.720 --> 2:35:58.000]  absolutely what do you see unfolding with the banks as the economy gets worse
[2:35:58.000 --> 2:36:03.800]  and worse as the looting expands as the shops and factories close as the people
[2:36:03.800 --> 2:36:07.240]  discover the Federal Reserve is private which they've now done and that they are
[2:36:07.240 --> 2:36:12.280]  doing this by design and as the calls for Geithner to be indicted for Bankster
[2:36:12.280 --> 2:36:22.480]  Gate intensify where do you see this going well first of all I've not known
[2:36:22.480 --> 2:36:29.160]  of any alumnus who's ever gone to jail I can't remember in the last 50 years one
[2:36:29.160 --> 2:36:36.720]  that did if anything what they do is they say yeah he's guilty but we're
[2:36:36.720 --> 2:36:40.560]  gonna find him and that'll be the end of it and then they'll put him in the
[2:36:40.560 --> 2:36:46.720]  on the staff of some foundation or several boards of directors this sort of
[2:36:46.720 --> 2:36:50.240]  thing now that's how they get away with that and they have to do that because of
[2:36:50.240 --> 2:36:54.040]  any other crooks ever go to prison that sets the precedent that other crooks
[2:36:54.040 --> 2:36:57.800]  can go to prison that's like in the old days in Europe if a king was overthrown
[2:36:57.800 --> 2:37:02.800]  the other king would just have him exiled or Napoleon would be exiled you
[2:37:02.800 --> 2:37:07.040]  know to a different island because they don't want to set the precedent to ever
[2:37:07.040 --> 2:37:14.440]  taking down a kingpin especially one of their own and that's very important
[2:37:14.440 --> 2:37:21.320]  because their pecking order is important to them they cover for each other and
[2:37:21.320 --> 2:37:26.740]  even though sometimes they're at great odds with one another the the
[2:37:26.740 --> 2:37:35.120]  conspiracy itself is foremost and first the generation of power from one
[2:37:35.120 --> 2:37:40.440]  generation to another and so they they don't let each other down and if they
[2:37:40.440 --> 2:37:46.280]  do it's a mistake I mean they're they do argue and fight among each other
[2:37:46.280 --> 2:37:52.520]  verbally about what should be done and the people like Geithner and Rothschild
[2:37:52.520 --> 2:37:57.360]  keeping their mouth shut and in Kramer Kramer keeping his mouth shut too but
[2:37:57.360 --> 2:38:03.680]  then that that would be a miracle and but you know if you don't think all the
[2:38:03.680 --> 2:38:08.320]  time about what you're saying you can really get yourself in trouble right
[2:38:08.320 --> 2:38:16.240]  Alex Bob so so how do you see this unfolding then with the banks and the
[2:38:16.240 --> 2:38:19.920]  economy and I don't know if you saw the Soros clip it's up on prisonplanet.com
[2:38:19.920 --> 2:38:23.080]  we're gonna play it coming out of the next break so you can comment on it
[2:38:23.080 --> 2:38:27.520]  further he's really bad mouthing gold right now saying it's the biggest bubble
[2:38:27.520 --> 2:38:32.400]  when the currencies are all being simultaneously devalued they're pumping
[2:38:32.400 --> 2:38:37.960]  trillions out into the economy to buy up assets I mean gold is only going up
[2:38:37.960 --> 2:38:42.960]  because they're devaluing currency so gold cost more isn't the currency and
[2:38:42.960 --> 2:38:49.200]  derivatives the ultimate bubble they certainly are and you gotta look at
[2:38:49.200 --> 2:38:54.720]  George's background convicted of stock fraud in France he appealed and lost
[2:38:54.720 --> 2:39:02.760]  convicted of stock fraud in Hungary not too long ago no appeal yet the guy is an
[2:39:02.760 --> 2:39:07.560]  arch criminal he's a front man for the illuminati and they say look this is
[2:39:07.560 --> 2:39:12.360]  what we're gonna do so you go out and do this this this this and this and what
[2:39:12.360 --> 2:39:16.920]  will happen is you'll make about 20 billion dollars and then you will take
[2:39:16.920 --> 2:39:21.040]  that money and this is where you'll put it and this is what you'll do with it and
[2:39:21.040 --> 2:39:26.440]  that's how it works and when you die all the money that you've accumulated let's
[2:39:26.440 --> 2:39:30.400]  say it's a hundred billion dollars that will go through these different groups
[2:39:30.400 --> 2:39:37.480]  and foundations which we control but George is doing this because he's being
[2:39:37.480 --> 2:39:45.560]  told to do it well it's one it's like that it's like that clip it's like that
[2:39:45.560 --> 2:39:50.960]  clip from him a few months ago where he said of course I know where the dollar
[2:39:50.960 --> 2:39:56.040]  will be going but I am will not of course tell you I mean just a completely
[2:39:56.040 --> 2:40:03.000]  arrogant criminal piece of garbage it was just you know here's a separate
[2:40:03.000 --> 2:40:09.280]  question I'm gonna go back to gold the profile again Alex of the three people
[2:40:09.280 --> 2:40:17.440]  we just talked about arrogance above all above everyone and it's a hallmark with
[2:40:17.440 --> 2:40:23.320]  these people nowadays they never acted that way in the 60s and 70s and 80s and
[2:40:23.320 --> 2:40:28.160]  90s but they do now why I mean everybody's waking up to them why are
[2:40:28.160 --> 2:40:32.160]  they so arrogant now well I'm just telling you you're not gonna take us down
[2:40:32.160 --> 2:40:36.560]  and I get news of them they're gonna get taken down how do you think the
[2:40:36.560 --> 2:40:44.240]  arrogance is a front absolutely it's a psychological defense for a sociopath I
[2:40:44.240 --> 2:40:50.840]  mean did you see guy there like he he treated look like a corner devil he
[2:40:50.840 --> 2:40:55.920]  looked like a corner devil I'm sorry go ahead yes and did you see our friend
[2:40:55.920 --> 2:41:01.760]  mr. Paulson was terrified he was terrified and that's the second time I've
[2:41:01.760 --> 2:41:08.240]  seen that and yeah he's losing it he reportedly emotional heat he reportedly
[2:41:08.240 --> 2:41:13.080]  collapsed once after one of these and he is now shaking and can't talk and he
[2:41:13.080 --> 2:41:17.680]  was I've got he didn't used to be like that that's right this is an
[2:41:17.680 --> 2:41:23.280]  evolutionary process he got himself in with the Illuminati and and he was
[2:41:23.280 --> 2:41:27.280]  boosted to all these positions because he was one of their donkeys and did what
[2:41:27.280 --> 2:41:32.680]  he was told and now after he's made down on hundreds of millions of dollars he's
[2:41:32.680 --> 2:41:42.040]  being having opposition bring him on the carpet and he can't handle it a lot of
[2:41:42.040 --> 2:41:48.280]  that Bob you remember 25 years ago when Volcker would be brought up or 15 years
[2:41:48.280 --> 2:41:52.560]  ago 10 years ago when Greenspan I mean they acted like the Queen of England was
[2:41:52.560 --> 2:41:59.360]  there everyone was just shaking and and and the Congress were just sir now they
[2:41:59.360 --> 2:42:03.200]  treat him with arrogance and contempt like they should be their their their
[2:42:03.200 --> 2:42:09.560]  shield of infallibility has dropped it's gone they haven't got the Volcker yet
[2:42:09.560 --> 2:42:14.200]  but they sure getting the Greenspan his books coming out on it and what a
[2:42:14.200 --> 2:42:19.640]  dreadful character he is and you know he sold out what was right I mean that's
[2:42:19.640 --> 2:42:24.520]  really the bottom line well he was one of us fellow man he was one of us at a
[2:42:24.520 --> 2:42:27.320]  time I mean he was writing books about the New World Order everything that's
[2:42:27.320 --> 2:42:34.040]  going on and that makes it ten times worse you know he is one of the few who
[2:42:34.040 --> 2:42:39.080]  was actually you know anti-New World Order pro gold anti-fellow reserve I
[2:42:39.080 --> 2:42:43.240]  mean you read his writings in the 60s and 70s he was one of us they literally
[2:42:43.240 --> 2:42:49.840]  turned him to the dark side it's because he couldn't make it as an economist he
[2:42:49.840 --> 2:42:55.680]  had one client left when he joined the Federal Reserve and they propelled him
[2:42:55.680 --> 2:42:59.320]  upward they said let's make a deal you do this this and this it will give you
[2:42:59.320 --> 2:43:05.600]  that that and that and he went for it he sold out his fellow conservators will
[2:43:05.600 --> 2:43:15.000]  call him unbelievable and of course Volcker has always been one tough cookie
[2:43:15.000 --> 2:43:22.360]  and he would never get in like Paulson and in quiver under cross
[2:43:22.360 --> 2:43:29.400]  examination will call it and he would never it be arrogant like we just saw
[2:43:29.400 --> 2:43:36.960]  Geithner or or Rothschild he's too smart for that well Geithner Geithner literally
[2:43:36.960 --> 2:43:43.560]  looked like he was going insane I mean he looked I mean he was I mean he was I
[2:43:43.560 --> 2:43:49.120]  mean I mean just the faces he was making well just ask any psychiatrist and he'll
[2:43:49.120 --> 2:43:53.920]  tell you but Alec you're absolutely right it's the reaction of a cornered
[2:43:53.920 --> 2:43:59.240]  sociopath and that's what they are all they all are I mean there's other words
[2:43:59.240 --> 2:44:04.200]  that some of them are actually insane but they happen to be in control and we
[2:44:04.200 --> 2:44:07.640]  got to take them down and that's what this program is all about and all the
[2:44:07.640 --> 2:44:10.960]  programs like it and all the internet and we're gonna make their lives
[2:44:10.960 --> 2:44:16.360]  absolutely miserable until they finally are defeated or they give up one of the
[2:44:16.360 --> 2:44:20.400]  other meanwhile they just want to get us in fighting with each other we can't
[2:44:20.400 --> 2:44:27.120]  let them do that that's right absolutely and so Mr. Soros is just
[2:44:27.120 --> 2:44:32.840]  doing what he's being told to do I mean you gotta look at his background I mean
[2:44:32.840 --> 2:44:40.120]  he is a Jewish man who helped the Nazis kill his own people I mean what kind of
[2:44:40.120 --> 2:44:49.120]  a human being is that that is awful well it's the same thing with Madeline
[2:44:49.120 --> 2:44:57.640]  Albright's dad mm-hmm I mean it just never discovered she was she was Jewish
[2:44:57.640 --> 2:45:05.640]  maybe a year or two before she left the general theme so to speak and all her
[2:45:05.640 --> 2:45:12.120]  life she didn't know and of course she did now now expanding on on the gold
[2:45:12.120 --> 2:45:17.640]  situation obviously if currencies are continuing to devalue gold is gonna go up
[2:45:17.640 --> 2:45:22.560]  and and Soros is always trying to manipulate the markets what does that
[2:45:22.560 --> 2:45:26.040]  mean to you does that mean they're having trouble suppressing it he's trying
[2:45:26.040 --> 2:45:32.480]  to further keep it down yes it does and I'll tell you today I wrote a piece it's
[2:45:32.480 --> 2:45:41.280]  going to be a tomorrow's forecaster and it's about the fact last February the
[2:45:41.280 --> 2:45:49.160]  Fed reserve made a deal with five of the six central banks that are currencies
[2:45:49.160 --> 2:45:55.760]  that they have that are in the USDX the US dollar index and it was Japan
[2:45:55.760 --> 2:46:06.280]  Canada Switzerland the European Central Bank and who did I miss well the one I
[2:46:06.280 --> 2:46:12.000]  left out was Sweden and so anyway they swapped 500 billion dollars and what they
[2:46:12.000 --> 2:46:18.480]  do is they give these nations five of them 500 billion dollars or a hundred
[2:46:18.480 --> 2:46:25.640]  billion dollars each which the Fed makes up about a thin air and in turn from
[2:46:25.640 --> 2:46:30.560]  that they get the foreign current currencies of those nations the cities
[2:46:30.560 --> 2:46:36.160]  of why would they do that they do that to support the dollar because when the
[2:46:36.160 --> 2:46:43.160]  dollar gets weak on the USDX they go in and sell those currencies into the market
[2:46:43.160 --> 2:46:49.040]  making the dollar go up I found out today that there wasn't 500 billion the
[2:46:49.040 --> 2:47:01.320]  rumor is it's 2 trillion now they're going to unravel that swamp which means that the
[2:47:01.320 --> 2:47:08.120]  manipulation that they were able to affect to keep the dollar higher isn't
[2:47:08.120 --> 2:47:15.320]  going to work anymore second of all the recipients of the dollars they took those
[2:47:15.320 --> 2:47:20.440]  dollars and they bought treasuries at auction or in the market that's not
[2:47:20.440 --> 2:47:28.640]  going to happen anymore now whether they'll try to unravel by buying back
[2:47:28.640 --> 2:47:35.360]  the foreign currencies that they sold or by the other central banks buying back
[2:47:35.360 --> 2:47:39.680]  the dollars that they sold I don't know that they'll do that and I don't think
[2:47:39.680 --> 2:47:46.800]  that they will they will hold it on the books and say this is an asset and this
[2:47:46.800 --> 2:47:52.680]  is a deficit and they offset each other that's what they'll do but the point is
[2:47:52.680 --> 2:47:59.440]  that the manipulation of dollars going to get far far more difficult and the
[2:47:59.440 --> 2:48:04.400]  dollar purchases of US Treasuries is going to
[2:48:04.400 --> 2:48:10.080]  diminuate as well so they're going to have some real problems another thing
[2:48:10.080 --> 2:48:16.840]  that's akin to that Alex is that at its height about a year and a half ago the
[2:48:16.840 --> 2:48:22.620]  US was increasing money and credit would used to be called M3 by about 17 and a
[2:48:22.620 --> 2:48:27.840]  half percent now it's about 4% so they've come down in the creation of
[2:48:27.840 --> 2:48:33.600]  money and credit the European Central Bank went from 12.8% listen to this
[2:48:33.600 --> 2:48:44.680]  to minus 0.02% for two months in a row now what they've done here is pulled the
[2:48:44.680 --> 2:48:50.480]  excess money and credit out of the world market essentially in order to keep the
[2:48:50.480 --> 2:48:57.360]  system going they have to have more money and credit now that means that they
[2:48:57.360 --> 2:49:04.200]  can't raise interest rates early or easily and it also means that the 12.7
[2:49:04.200 --> 2:49:07.640]  trillion dollars that they from the Federal Reserve of the Treasury
[2:49:07.640 --> 2:49:14.640]  Department posited into the economy cannot be pulled out and they're going
[2:49:14.640 --> 2:49:20.240]  to have to find a way not to pull more out but to add some in before the whole
[2:49:20.240 --> 2:49:25.280]  thing collapses and that's why they want a new jobs bill which congressmen admit
[2:49:25.280 --> 2:49:28.720]  they've been told another banker bailout and that's why they want the new
[2:49:28.720 --> 2:49:34.560]  carbon taxes is a new way to pump more money in and but as things get worse and
[2:49:34.560 --> 2:49:41.840]  worse like last year they put out fake numbers on on production manufacturing
[2:49:41.840 --> 2:49:45.920]  increases and then downscaled them six months later they put out new fake
[2:49:45.920 --> 2:49:52.520]  manufacturing with 5.2 today and clearly that's fake they say we've got 10%
[2:49:52.520 --> 2:49:56.320]  unemployment when it's over 22 we're going to go to break Bob I'm going to
[2:49:56.320 --> 2:49:59.640]  keep you five minutes into the next hour of weekends we have time I want to get
[2:49:59.640 --> 2:50:03.240]  into how George Soros and others when we come out of breaker saying they're
[2:50:03.240 --> 2:50:08.160]  going to continue with SDRs to fund the new cap and trade system so the central
[2:50:08.160 --> 2:50:14.000]  banks will take tax money and give it to their own systems so I mean now I guess
[2:50:14.000 --> 2:50:18.120]  they're monetizing their own SDRs explain that to people then I want to get
[2:50:18.120 --> 2:50:22.480]  into the cap and trade scam to be enforced at state level they're talking
[2:50:22.480 --> 2:50:28.480]  about 2.6 billion new tax on Austin coming up they're taking over the
[2:50:28.480 --> 2:50:33.320]  cities the UN is here running the operation in Austin so we're gonna go
[2:50:33.320 --> 2:50:36.640]  to break come back with about a minute and a half of Soros on this and then get

[2:54:02.040 --> 2:54:06.800]  honestly okay let me switch gears in Copenhagen and you talked about your
[2:54:06.800 --> 2:54:11.920]  proposal as a way to fund co2 cuts talk to us a little about that and how rich
[2:54:11.920 --> 2:54:18.000]  nations might tap into that special currency well the Copenhagen let's face
[2:54:18.000 --> 2:54:28.160]  it was a bust it was a disappointment but I think that the global warming or the
[2:54:28.160 --> 2:54:35.800]  climate change doesn't go away and we have to deal with it and it's of course
[2:54:35.800 --> 2:54:42.880]  very difficult now with each country under pressure at home to make any large
[2:54:42.880 --> 2:54:49.360]  grants or financing to the less developed world so I put forward a plan
[2:54:49.360 --> 2:54:54.320]  that they can use as the special drawing rights they received in the last
[2:54:54.320 --> 2:55:00.480]  distribution for which they have no use because their credit is good enough to
[2:55:00.480 --> 2:55:08.360]  lend it back to the IMF and and then the IMF can use it to set up a green fund
[2:55:08.360 --> 2:55:15.040]  that would finance investments for clean energy and infrastructure agriculture
[2:55:15.040 --> 2:55:22.120]  and so on and then the IMF would be responsible for paying the interest and
[2:55:22.120 --> 2:55:31.160]  that that could be then financed either by the developed world picking up that
[2:55:31.160 --> 2:55:37.920]  cost which is actually tiny through their overseas development assistance
[2:55:37.920 --> 2:55:44.440]  programs or the IMF or they could authorize the IMF to use its gold
[2:55:44.440 --> 2:55:52.000]  reserves to pay the interest and the amounts involved are insignificant and
[2:55:52.000 --> 2:55:59.840]  as long as the countries that lend it to the IMF have the IMF as the
[2:55:59.840 --> 2:56:04.200]  counterparty there is no credit risk
[2:56:06.600 --> 2:56:11.640]  well George Soros goes on and on in the interview how they're gonna continue
[2:56:11.640 --> 2:56:14.360]  getting our property they're gonna continue coming after our land they're
[2:56:14.360 --> 2:56:17.560]  gonna continue to try to set up a global dictatorship that decides who can
[2:56:17.560 --> 2:56:22.040]  have a business who can't and Austin is the crown jewel just they're hiring
[2:56:22.040 --> 2:56:26.040]  former Pentagon officials black ops it's in the paper oh the black ops
[2:56:26.040 --> 2:56:31.120]  commander CIA black ops in psych warfare is running the program I mean hellish
[2:56:31.120 --> 2:56:35.480]  inspectors coming into our houses brainwashing our kids they mean business
[2:56:35.480 --> 2:56:40.480]  Bob Chapman they certainly do and they've never meant meant anything but
[2:56:40.480 --> 2:56:45.480]  business and they're not gonna give up easy and as you can see they're trying
[2:56:45.480 --> 2:56:54.440]  to bypass legislation through various means to implement this global warming
[2:56:54.440 --> 2:57:01.760]  climate change taxation model and and they're gonna continue to do it as long
[2:57:01.760 --> 2:57:07.400]  as we let them now Bob we went to break you were starting to get a little bit
[2:57:07.400 --> 2:57:10.880]  into how much trouble they're in and what's gonna happen with the economy I
[2:57:10.880 --> 2:57:15.200]  mean they wanted to implode it to consolidate it that's in the Goldman
[2:57:15.200 --> 2:57:18.560]  Sachs documents but you're saying this has gotten out of hand for them the
[2:57:18.560 --> 2:57:23.800]  greedinesses they've kind of over gorge themselves on our blood I think I think
[2:57:23.800 --> 2:57:30.040]  that's true and I also I I don't know what they're going to do next they're
[2:57:30.040 --> 2:57:35.960]  either ready to pull the plug or they're gonna have to reinflate again and I
[2:57:35.960 --> 2:57:39.720]  don't know which and I don't think anybody else does for that matter all we
[2:57:39.720 --> 2:57:46.560]  can do is guess but this is the smallest amount of money and credit that I've
[2:57:46.560 --> 2:57:51.760]  seen in a long long time by a multiplicity of countries so this is
[2:57:51.760 --> 2:57:57.440]  centrally planned this is not coincidence it's just like the comment and
[2:57:57.440 --> 2:58:07.520]  hearing that's going on in created by the administration to see what the
[2:58:07.520 --> 2:58:14.440]  public reaction is going to be to government issuing annuities for your
[2:58:14.440 --> 2:58:20.920]  retirement plans that's right they're saying they're gonna take your 401k or
[2:58:20.920 --> 2:58:24.680]  or your pension this is mainstream news I told you four years ago they were gonna
[2:58:24.680 --> 2:58:29.200]  do it and they're gonna tax it and manage it for you Bob you're not gonna be
[2:58:29.200 --> 2:58:31.960]  allowed to have your own bank account not gonna be allowed to they're now
[2:58:31.960 --> 2:58:37.720]  saying this is again federal regulation they're saying that money markets aren't
[2:58:37.720 --> 2:58:40.760]  insured stay there Bob
[2:58:40.760 --> 2:58:46.360]  America's number one stories for independent talk radio for over a decade
[2:58:46.360 --> 2:58:52.920]  we are the GCN radio network this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you
[2:58:52.920 --> 2:58:56.800]  should consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate
[2:58:56.800 --> 2:59:00.560]  legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our
[2:59:00.560 --> 2:59:04.520]  new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[2:59:04.520 --> 2:59:08.880]  you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[2:59:08.880 --> 2:59:13.320]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[2:59:13.320 --> 2:59:18.080]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[2:59:18.080 --> 2:59:21.880]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[2:59:21.880 --> 2:59:25.480]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[2:59:25.480 --> 2:59:29.840]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[2:59:29.840 --> 2:59:33.000]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[2:59:33.000 --> 2:59:36.680]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you

[2:59:53.320 --> 3:00:00.920]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCM radio network
[3:00:06.920 --> 3:00:13.320]  there is so much I want to talk to Bob Chapman about we are out of time we got
[3:00:13.320 --> 3:00:19.560]  dr. Tim ball climatologist coming up but we know Paulson in the coordinated
[3:00:19.560 --> 3:00:23.720]  effort with the european central banks plunge the housing market they started
[3:00:23.720 --> 3:00:29.160]  using their media to badmouth it in 2007 now they blame the Russians for the
[3:00:29.160 --> 3:00:34.680]  economic crisis of 2008 he says a secret conspiracy when the Russian market
[3:00:34.680 --> 3:00:39.200]  went down by what over 60% with no evidence I mean they're really getting
[3:00:39.200 --> 3:00:45.000]  desperate now in testimony Bob Chapman oh they certainly are and I noticed the
[3:00:45.000 --> 3:00:49.720]  president came out and said we're not putting those missiles and radar
[3:00:49.720 --> 3:00:58.000]  stations 35 miles away from Kalanin well the Russian city that's nearby and
[3:00:58.000 --> 3:01:03.320]  and this is the exact opposite of what the previous administration said it
[3:01:03.320 --> 3:01:07.680]  they had to have the missiles and the radar because of Iran and now the
[3:01:07.680 --> 3:01:12.960]  United States government is admitting that that wasn't the case our previous
[3:01:12.960 --> 3:01:18.360]  president lied and it's really because we don't trust the Russians well I mean
[3:01:18.360 --> 3:01:23.520]  what's incredible about this is on record the big banks the central banks the
[3:01:23.520 --> 3:01:27.960]  kingpin banks not your Mayberry bank folks but the big global banks they
[3:01:27.960 --> 3:01:34.200]  engineered this whole thing on purpose in public and to now have conspiracy
[3:01:34.200 --> 3:01:40.320]  theories about how the Russians did it is just asinine they are taking over the
[3:01:40.320 --> 3:01:43.600]  major highways for toll roads we're fighting them on that they just
[3:01:43.600 --> 3:01:47.120]  rechanged the name and go and say they've canceled it and go ahead with it
[3:01:47.120 --> 3:01:52.200]  they say okay we won't put a toll road there and then they just do it I mean how
[3:01:52.200 --> 3:01:56.280]  long can they get away with this seizing everything it shows they're going for
[3:01:56.280 --> 3:02:00.840]  broke pretty much militarily where they just keep denying denying denying as
[3:02:00.840 --> 3:02:04.040]  they keep doing it and now they're coming in saying they're gonna seize
[3:02:04.040 --> 3:02:08.080]  all our major energy locally in every major city and have environmental
[3:02:08.080 --> 3:02:13.720]  spec inspectors in our houses and and 2.6 billion in Austin alone of new taxes
[3:02:13.720 --> 3:02:19.360]  in the next three years I mean my god they are just going wild that's right
[3:02:19.360 --> 3:02:24.800]  and it's up to people at the local level to stop them I mean it's their cities
[3:02:24.800 --> 3:02:29.960]  their towns their counties and their states that are being intruded upon
[3:02:29.960 --> 3:02:35.320]  they're in sovereignty collectively is being misused by these people I mean
[3:02:35.320 --> 3:02:39.800]  what do these people come through from get out of here don't do that we don't
[3:02:39.800 --> 3:02:46.360]  want you do you hear that in Austin well the public thinks they're going bankrupt
[3:02:46.360 --> 3:02:52.160]  now just wait and again that's the plan isn't it Bob it certainly is we got 40
[3:02:52.160 --> 3:02:56.920]  states on the edge and and three of them are really in trouble and of course
[3:02:56.920 --> 3:03:02.640]  California is the is the number one victim which has been coming for years
[3:03:02.640 --> 3:03:07.560]  I lived there for 36 years I left because I said in 1994 they're going
[3:03:07.560 --> 3:03:12.600]  bankrupt it's over and of course it took a little bit longer than I thought but
[3:03:12.600 --> 3:03:17.200]  it's over it's no way they can get out they're gonna have to cut pensions and
[3:03:17.200 --> 3:03:22.760]  salaries and have layoffs and and they're gonna have to get rid of their
[3:03:22.760 --> 3:03:27.440]  illegal aliens Bob we've only got a minute and a half left when they make
[3:03:27.440 --> 3:03:31.080]  the federal declarations which they've already made they're going to not
[3:03:31.080 --> 3:03:35.120]  ensure money markets which are savings accounts and that they're going to take
[3:03:35.120 --> 3:03:39.560]  people's pension funds but the government will keep it for you and give you
[3:03:39.560 --> 3:03:44.680]  part of it I mean do they think the public's gonna put up with that well
[3:03:44.680 --> 3:03:48.880]  they bring it gets closer to revolution right I'll tell you that we either take
[3:03:48.880 --> 3:03:54.440]  over with new people in the House and the Senate and get 1207 passes part of
[3:03:54.440 --> 3:03:58.560]  the appropriations bill or it's over they will get it in the streets and they
[3:03:58.560 --> 3:04:04.040]  will not survive believe me they don't stand a chance and our military is not
[3:04:04.040 --> 3:04:08.680]  gonna shoot us believe me well that's the good news Bob is the elites have for
[3:04:08.680 --> 3:04:15.160]  the last four years all been moving their main homes to remote islands and so
[3:04:15.160 --> 3:04:20.560]  they may just be robbing us and and leaving a base here hoping they're
[3:04:20.560 --> 3:04:26.480]  gonna win well I'll tell you going to a remote somewhere is not the answer
[3:04:26.480 --> 3:04:31.840]  because today it's so easy to track people down unless you're really an
[3:04:31.840 --> 3:04:35.840]  expert it's not like after the Second World War and all those Nazis were
[3:04:35.840 --> 3:04:39.720]  hiding all over the world this is a different thing and they're not gonna

[3:06:04.520 --> 3:06:09.520]  last century alone this is our last chance to not relive history as we're
[3:06:09.520 --> 3:06:13.320]  finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath the
[3:06:13.320 --> 3:06:17.480]  Americans at home have tremendous influence on our president in
[3:06:17.480 --> 3:06:22.600]  Congress and they really are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of
[3:06:22.600 --> 3:06:27.600]  us as American citizens to pay attention fall of the Republic identifies the
[3:06:27.600 --> 3:06:32.400]  enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying
[3:06:32.400 --> 3:06:36.400]  sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner
[3:06:36.400 --> 3:06:40.560]  Bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying
[3:06:40.560 --> 3:06:44.560]  who do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right

[3:08:09.680 --> 3:08:13.840]  going to be talking to dr. Tim ball a renowned environmental consultant
[3:08:13.840 --> 3:08:17.780]  former climatology professor at the University of Winnipeg dr. Ball
[3:08:17.780 --> 3:08:21.480]  poises expertise background in climatology in other fields as an
[3:08:21.480 --> 3:08:26.200]  advisor to the international climate science coalition friends of science in
[3:08:26.200 --> 3:08:32.040]  the frontier Center for Public Policy they'd call for his arrest in England I
[3:08:32.040 --> 3:08:34.800]  mean they've said that he and Lord Monkton and others should just be
[3:08:34.800 --> 3:08:40.920]  arrested cast Sunstein the new regulations are says arrest people if
[3:08:40.920 --> 3:08:46.120]  they deny climate change so now all these tens of thousands I mean 30
[3:08:46.120 --> 3:08:50.440]  something thousand sent letters to Congress top scientist climatologist
[3:08:50.440 --> 3:08:57.920]  hydrologist meteorologist and Al Gore said that testimony won't be allowed his
[3:08:57.920 --> 3:09:02.440]  friends in the Democratic Party said no not allowed and he said the science has
[3:09:02.440 --> 3:09:06.840]  settled no one disagrees and Obama said that in his speech two nights ago at the
[3:09:06.840 --> 3:09:10.200]  State of the Union he said you know there's no questions so we're going to
[3:09:10.200 --> 3:09:17.920]  Dr. Tim ball here in just a moment to talk about all those issues with him now
[3:09:17.920 --> 3:09:21.520]  we know this is all based on fraudulent science it's publicly admitted with their
[3:09:21.520 --> 3:09:27.440]  own internal emails and now more than 10 new scandals where they the whole UN all
[3:09:27.440 --> 3:09:32.720]  the universities they use all a tissue of lies and fraud with them caught red
[3:09:32.720 --> 3:09:37.600]  handed lying on purpose I mean this is like somebody calling the fire department
[3:09:37.600 --> 3:09:40.960]  saying my neighbor's house is on fire and then the fire department pulls up
[3:09:40.960 --> 3:09:46.280]  there's no fire and they see the guy laughing saying I lied I lied I mean he
[3:09:46.280 --> 3:09:51.320]  gets arrested for a false report I mean there's there's no doubt we have them
[3:09:51.320 --> 3:09:55.480]  red-handed but they're not gonna stop so I wanted to read this because this is the
[3:09:55.480 --> 3:10:01.600]  new angle in England the EU their own government common purpose in Canada in
[3:10:01.600 --> 3:10:07.580]  the US in Europe in Japan the federal governments in the UN are just open
[3:10:07.580 --> 3:10:13.240]  funding the cities and the banks and the federal money to seize houses seize
[3:10:13.240 --> 3:10:17.680]  property shut down power plants huge boondoggles to Al Gore and others that
[3:10:17.680 --> 3:10:22.680]  own these windmill companies that you lose 2.2 jobs on average every time you
[3:10:22.680 --> 3:10:27.600]  fund them and they cost $700,000 per green job they create so as they kill
[3:10:27.600 --> 3:10:33.560]  your economy they say more a strong system to destroy industrial society it
[3:10:33.560 --> 3:10:38.520]  will give you jobs and so yeah one out of a hundred or so they do get a job as
[3:10:38.520 --> 3:10:43.200]  enforcers of the destruction meanwhile China is the new industrial haven where
[3:10:43.200 --> 3:10:47.000]  everything's authorized so no one else is allowed to manufacture this is really
[3:10:47.000 --> 3:10:51.480]  mercantilism but China and a few of the third-world countries they're bringing
[3:10:51.480 --> 3:10:56.200]  back mercantilism you know the colonies couldn't produce anything that was a
[3:10:56.200 --> 3:11:04.120]  value-added good only raw cotton tobacco you know things like that corn wheat
[3:11:04.120 --> 3:11:07.760]  that's how the British and French empires operated mercantilism was
[3:11:07.760 --> 3:11:12.080]  developed 400 years ago into the system and is now to keep only certain elites
[3:11:12.080 --> 3:11:15.080]  in power that's what this in fake environmentalism is we're going to
[3:11:15.080 --> 3:11:18.520]  Tim ball here in a minute but I wanted to start into this article from
[3:11:18.520 --> 3:11:22.120]  prisonplanet.com it's only been out for about two hours I'm asking everyone
[3:11:22.120 --> 3:11:26.680]  especially in cities where it's happening San Francisco Austin Texas LA
[3:11:26.680 --> 3:11:33.320]  New York Boston you had better Miami small towns they're doing it and I mean
[3:11:33.320 --> 3:11:37.200]  there's UN representatives the feds are here I've been to the meetings they
[3:11:37.200 --> 3:11:41.000]  laugh and admit it home inspectors taking your property I mean it's already
[3:11:41.000 --> 3:11:44.600]  been held here in Austin the mayor former mayors openly take the property
[3:11:44.600 --> 3:11:49.500]  later they took I mean just it's just wall makes it's like Geithner's
[3:11:49.500 --> 3:11:54.400]  thieving cap and trade scam to be enforced at state level and earlier I
[3:11:54.400 --> 3:12:03.480]  read to you on air all of the mainstream news articles out of Bloomberg you name
[3:12:03.480 --> 3:12:07.520]  it I'll show you some of those coming up they're here in my stack I need to dig
[3:12:07.520 --> 3:12:12.480]  them out where they admit okay they can't get it at the Congressional level
[3:12:12.480 --> 3:12:16.760]  with the Senate they can't pass this this tyranny so they'll have the EPA at
[3:12:16.760 --> 3:12:20.080]  the federal bureaucracy do it and they'll have local governments do it at
[3:12:20.080 --> 3:12:24.040]  international governments come in and fund your local government so foreign
[3:12:24.040 --> 3:12:30.600]  governments coming in with a 2.6 million tax 2.6 billion dollar tax in
[3:12:30.600 --> 3:12:38.560]  Austin alone globalist intent on ushering in a zero growth post-industrial
[3:12:38.560 --> 3:12:41.960]  society are bypassing the federal government's stuttering efforts
[3:12:41.960 --> 3:12:45.240]  to implement the cap and trade scam and going directly to the states in an
[3:12:45.240 --> 3:12:49.560]  effort to impose their control freak tax on every life-giving gas that we all
[3:12:49.560 --> 3:12:57.040]  exhale carbon dioxide and it just goes on and on it says the Austin energy which
[3:12:57.040 --> 3:13:01.200]  powers the city presented to the city council Austin energy carbon reduction
[3:13:01.200 --> 3:13:05.400]  plan which goes even further than the federal cap and trade bill and calling
[3:13:05.400 --> 3:13:09.840]  for co2 emissions to be reduced by 20 percent the fact that the energy
[3:13:09.840 --> 3:13:13.480]  companies are behind this again disproves the flawed notion that the oil
[3:13:13.480 --> 3:13:16.800]  electricity companies oppose the global warming movement no they get all the
[3:13:16.800 --> 3:13:21.560]  money to put in the windmills and then it's taxes on natural gas it's home
[3:13:21.560 --> 3:13:24.640]  inspections I mean folks I'm gonna read more of this letter I want to go to
[3:13:24.640 --> 3:13:29.760]  Dr. Tim Ball while I dig out mother stories I wanted to go to but but I
[3:13:29.760 --> 3:13:33.920]  mean this is so diabolical and when I tried to tell Dr. Tim Ball during the
[3:13:33.920 --> 3:13:37.720]  break about this he said yes I know Alex but it's all based on fraud and I know
[3:13:37.720 --> 3:13:41.480]  that he knows that but you got to go to your city councils and say this is all
[3:13:41.480 --> 3:13:47.600]  an admitted bona fide scam developed by Enron in the UN this it's just so
[3:13:47.600 --> 3:13:49.360]  amazing
[3:13:49.360 --> 3:13:53.120]  climatologist Tim Ball thanks for being here with us well thank you Alex thanks
[3:13:53.120 --> 3:13:58.000]  for the opportunity and a very good summary of what's going on and I've
[3:13:58.000 --> 3:14:02.840]  watched them hijack climate science as the vehicle and as we've talked about
[3:14:02.840 --> 3:14:08.280]  before going back to the Club of Rome where they state that global warming is
[3:14:08.280 --> 3:14:12.760]  going to be the vehicle that they'll use to take control and we're seeing that
[3:14:12.760 --> 3:14:18.000]  and now even though the biggest scandal and I think without hyperbole the biggest
[3:14:18.000 --> 3:14:22.800]  scandal certainly in science history and possibly in world history where we're
[3:14:22.800 --> 3:14:27.760]  different all levels of government have been involved and and the IPCC and so on
[3:14:27.760 --> 3:14:32.680]  and yet it's virtually being downplayed and pushed aside as you know as somebody
[3:14:32.680 --> 3:14:36.000]  once said it's like the policemen say no nothing going on here move along move
[3:14:36.000 --> 3:14:40.520]  along and it's absolutely incredible and I think what people need to think about
[3:14:40.520 --> 3:14:48.840]  Alex is if this level of malfeasance and pure criminality occurred in any other
[3:14:48.840 --> 3:14:54.480]  discipline I mean the people would be locked up instantly and if it occurred
[3:14:54.480 --> 3:15:01.320]  in medicine for example even a fraction of it but somehow they're able to
[3:15:01.320 --> 3:15:06.720]  gloss it over and pretend that nothing's wrong and then they the latest game is
[3:15:06.720 --> 3:15:10.880]  oh no the fundamental science is still okay in fact John Beddington the head of
[3:15:10.880 --> 3:15:15.800]  the UK science group saying this well no it isn't that's the whole point of what
[3:15:15.800 --> 3:15:19.600]  the skeptics were trying to point out. There's now universities governments
[3:15:19.600 --> 3:15:25.280]  admitting thermometer fraud always to make it look like it's hotter caught red
[3:15:25.280 --> 3:15:31.120]  handed in Canada the US New Zealand England Russia I mean and and we have the
[3:15:31.120 --> 3:15:34.960]  UN documents where they went in the mid 90s and recruited these key
[3:15:34.960 --> 3:15:40.280]  universities to unify the fraud and Bill Santor the head of the UN program
[3:15:40.280 --> 3:15:43.320]  admitting they took out all the scientists out of the report in the
[3:15:43.320 --> 3:15:48.360]  mid 90s saying man isn't doing this and Pachari making money off shutting down
[3:15:48.360 --> 3:15:53.400]  factories and relocating them to India and admitting they lied in the report
[3:15:53.400 --> 3:15:58.080]  about the melting of the glaciers and the Himalayas admitting oh we did that to
[3:15:58.080 --> 3:16:03.040]  scare you I mean that just red-handed fraud everywhere Al Gore making money
[3:16:03.040 --> 3:16:08.360]  off of it the Rothschilds the Rockefellers just all of it.
[3:16:08.360 --> 3:16:14.240]  Alex and Pachari himself he's made a huge amount of money and in fact the
[3:16:14.240 --> 3:16:20.400]  the scientist that was quoted by a reporter saying that the glaciers
[3:16:20.400 --> 3:16:26.640]  and the Himalayas will be gone by 2035 he works for Tara which is owned and run
[3:16:26.640 --> 3:16:31.080]  by Pachari. Exactly it's all come out that every major scientist whether it's
[3:16:31.080 --> 3:16:36.640]  the flu scare the the economists hired for the takeover of health care all the
[3:16:36.640 --> 3:16:43.120]  major scientists and spokesmen are all on the payroll of the carbon traders yep
[3:16:43.120 --> 3:16:49.600]  yeah I mean it's just total fraud out in the open right and I watched it you
[3:16:49.600 --> 3:16:54.720]  know that 30 years ago with a guy named Tom Wigley and he was the guy that took
[3:16:54.720 --> 3:16:58.800]  control of the climatic research unit which is where the all of the rock was
[3:16:58.800 --> 3:17:02.080]  centric from the climate climate science point of view I'm not talking
[3:17:02.080 --> 3:17:06.000]  necessarily now about the political side of it that was more strong and the UN and
[3:17:06.000 --> 3:17:12.080]  the IPCC. Well Wigley and Jones and Jones is now you know been pushed aside as
[3:17:12.080 --> 3:17:19.320]  they had those two attended the first meeting in 1985 to set up the IPCC
[3:17:19.320 --> 3:17:25.560]  and then they provided the science that strong in his gang needed to push this
[3:17:25.560 --> 3:17:33.560]  whole agenda of carbon and the CO2 is the problem and Wigley was the bag man
[3:17:33.560 --> 3:17:39.040]  and and if you read the emails he's the go-to guy he's the grandfather almost
[3:17:39.040 --> 3:17:42.240]  like the mafia and when you read the emails they're saying look we got this
[3:17:42.240 --> 3:17:45.680]  problem and he's telling them how to end run it now to deal with it he's the guy
[3:17:45.680 --> 3:17:51.000]  that's getting editors fired well then he moved to Canada probably arranged
[3:17:51.000 --> 3:17:55.400]  through Environment Canada and the Assistant Deputy Minister here and he
[3:17:55.400 --> 3:18:01.280]  became he got into more funding in Canada then he moved to NCAR where they
[3:18:01.280 --> 3:18:06.280]  just had a big retirement party for him attended by all the CRU people and all
[3:18:06.280 --> 3:18:11.600]  of these gangs and so much of the funding was going through NCAR in Boulder
[3:18:11.600 --> 3:18:16.520]  Colorado and in fact a lot of the funding going to the CRU was from there so
[3:18:16.520 --> 3:18:20.760]  these guys were controlling the the government funding that was going to
[3:18:20.760 --> 3:18:25.160]  perpetuate the bad science and meanwhile they were you there what they
[3:18:25.160 --> 3:18:30.920]  were doing was then being used the IPCC reports then became the documents of
[3:18:30.920 --> 3:18:36.280]  faith for governments around the world pushing the whole carbon and energy
[3:18:36.280 --> 3:18:45.760]  agenda yeah I mean I don't know how they're so arrogant but I mean I guess
[3:18:45.760 --> 3:18:49.080]  they've got all the banking money all the power on their side their brain
[3:18:49.080 --> 3:18:53.640]  washing all the kids in the schools I mean it is a serious wound to them though
[3:18:53.640 --> 3:18:58.080]  that climate gate now looks mild compared to all the other fraud coming out
[3:18:58.080 --> 3:19:02.800]  but they run the government that would prosecute them and their George Soros is
[3:19:02.800 --> 3:19:06.920]  saying we're still gonna do it and the Austin City Council says we don't care
[3:19:06.920 --> 3:19:11.440]  of it Rex Austin we are gonna put a 2.6 billion dollar tax in the next three
[3:19:11.440 --> 3:19:16.480]  years just to build all these grids and tear out the and they say they're gonna
[3:19:16.480 --> 3:19:23.920]  put a huge 20% tax on everybody's natural gas yeah yeah well you know what
[3:19:23.920 --> 3:19:29.560]  one of the things that has gone on with this is the as I said using using the
[3:19:29.560 --> 3:19:34.760]  science base the false science but that what's come out so far is only the tip
[3:19:34.760 --> 3:19:39.040]  of the iceberg and I don't spend it to want to sound cute with that comment but
[3:19:39.040 --> 3:19:44.400]  I I know having watched them create this fraud for over 30 years and how they how
[3:19:44.400 --> 3:19:49.440]  they comment here to climate science I know that there's a lot lot more to come
[3:19:49.440 --> 3:19:54.320]  out yet I mean it's just a bunch of criminals all making money off of it
[3:19:54.320 --> 3:19:57.680]  and they're all a bunch of eugenicists population reductionists let's talk
[3:19:57.680 --> 3:20:03.080]  about that and how they're taken over the states hi this is Alex Jones did you
[3:20:03.080 --> 3:20:06.560]  know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret
[3:20:06.560 --> 3:20:09.920]  storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did you know that in a real meltdown
[3:20:09.920 --> 3:20:13.760]  non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold it's true
[3:20:13.760 --> 3:20:16.920]  seeds and I'll perform even gold and silver before in this country and it's
[3:20:16.920 --> 3:20:20.840]  possible that could even happen again so our friends at Solutions from Science
[3:20:20.840 --> 3:20:24.920]  have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a
[3:20:24.920 --> 3:20:29.840]  survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food
[3:20:29.840 --> 3:20:33.400]  for you and your family and here's the best part these seeds have not been
[3:20:33.400 --> 3:20:37.200]  genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a
[3:20:37.200 --> 3:20:42.400]  full acre crisis garden so visit them today at survival seed bank dot com that

[3:20:48.440 --> 3:20:56.720]  that's 877-327-0365 remember in a real crisis non-hybrid seeds are the
[3:20:56.720 --> 3:21:02.960]  ultimate barter item this is Alex Jones for survival seed bank dot com hundreds
[3:21:02.960 --> 3:21:07.320]  of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this is our last

[3:21:12.360 --> 3:21:15.920]  pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I have tremendous
[3:21:15.920 --> 3:21:21.000]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I
[3:21:21.000 --> 3:21:26.400]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention all
[3:21:26.400 --> 3:21:31.280]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[3:21:31.280 --> 3:21:35.680]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world

[3:21:39.400 --> 3:21:43.360]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems
[3:21:43.360 --> 3:21:48.920]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of

[3:22:09.400 --> 3:22:13.320]  gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job that the Fed will
[3:22:13.320 --> 3:22:17.520]  stop handing out trillions dollars like bailout candy that social security would
[3:22:17.520 --> 3:22:21.320]  be there for you that's not what's happening you might even pass on gold
[3:22:21.320 --> 3:22:25.400]  if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation or that the dollar wouldn't
[3:22:25.400 --> 3:22:29.960]  lose value or that your retirement would be secure if all looks rosy to you then

[3:25:01.400 --> 3:25:06.400]  the program and again for prison planet TV viewers there's the Bloomberg
[3:25:06.400 --> 3:25:11.240]  article here's energy plan comes to city council as legislature plans review
[3:25:11.240 --> 3:25:15.800]  how can the city be run by foreign private corporations also energy unveils
[3:25:15.800 --> 3:25:20.400]  carbon calculator at expo you're they're putting in the smart thermostats in
[3:25:20.400 --> 3:25:23.840]  your houses without asking you where they say they're going to control the
[3:25:23.840 --> 3:25:29.880]  temperature in your house California is doing it Obama laughed at after calling
[3:25:29.880 --> 3:25:34.240]  climate change evidence overwhelming dr. Tim ball top climatologist who's been
[3:25:34.240 --> 3:25:40.040]  persecuted by these people I mean this is total financial feudalism this is
[3:25:40.040 --> 3:25:44.960]  total domination Canada where you live is even worse you've already had multiple
[3:25:44.960 --> 3:25:50.800]  states up there past this I mean it's devastated Spain and then they love it
[3:25:50.800 --> 3:25:55.360]  yeah well you know you know the province that I live in British Columbia on the
[3:25:55.360 --> 3:26:00.000]  West Coast here and and one of the problems that I have with Canada is we've
[3:26:00.000 --> 3:26:05.040]  got more oil and energy and resources than in virtually any country in the
[3:26:05.040 --> 3:26:09.320]  world yet we're paying top prices I mean it's unbelievable it's like paying
[3:26:09.320 --> 3:26:13.640]  restaurant prices for food in your own home and one of the things in British
[3:26:13.640 --> 3:26:19.240]  Columbia here is that we were the first province jurisdiction in North America
[3:26:19.240 --> 3:26:26.120]  to introduce a carbon tax and what's annoying about it is that the premier
[3:26:26.120 --> 3:26:30.360]  before he got elected he attended a presentation that I gave and said
[3:26:30.360 --> 3:26:33.720]  afterwards I want to talk with you and get you to talk to my environment
[3:26:33.720 --> 3:26:39.240]  minister and that never happened then the next year after he'd been elected
[3:26:39.240 --> 3:26:43.240]  Premier he heard me talk again and said did you meet with him and I said no he
[3:26:43.240 --> 3:26:47.640]  said I'll make sure it happens the meeting was held in his office and he
[3:26:47.640 --> 3:26:50.840]  said I can't stay for the meeting but I want to make sure the meeting occurs and
[3:26:50.840 --> 3:26:56.240]  then and then what happens three years later suddenly he's introduced in a
[3:26:56.240 --> 3:27:01.920]  carbon tax and they're putting a billion dollars of taxpayer money into all of
[3:27:01.920 --> 3:27:07.840]  these absolutely useless schemes to combat climate change and I discover
[3:27:07.840 --> 3:27:12.840]  who's behind it all Andrew Weaver and who's Andrew Weaver he's the lead
[3:27:12.840 --> 3:27:18.240]  author of the chapters on the computer models at the IPCC and he got he got a
[3:27:18.240 --> 3:27:22.520]  hold of the government convinced him and when you read the government documents
[3:27:22.520 --> 3:27:29.920]  they all the absolute Bible again is the IPCC now Weaver by the way being the
[3:27:29.920 --> 3:27:34.720]  weasel that he is has just come out and said oh well you know there's problems of
[3:27:34.720 --> 3:27:40.000]  process with the IPCC and then we need to relook at how we're handling the
[3:27:40.000 --> 3:27:45.880]  science well he's one of the rats is deserting the sinking ship and by the
[3:27:45.880 --> 3:27:50.320]  way example of what's going on everywhere Alex and by the way on screen we
[3:27:50.320 --> 3:27:55.160]  have the Austin Energy Calculator it's similar to what Enron did you know
[3:27:55.160 --> 3:27:58.560]  Secretary of the Army White ran it before went to the Army they had fake
[3:27:58.560 --> 3:28:02.480]  computer models to show people how they didn't have any energy so they had to
[3:28:02.480 --> 3:28:06.680]  triple and quadruple in some cases even more money and then it turned out it was
[3:28:06.680 --> 3:28:10.480]  all just a made-up scam they're just seizing our energy and saying they're
[3:28:10.480 --> 3:28:14.200]  going to jack up our prices and they make little fake computer graphics for the
[3:28:14.200 --> 3:28:19.800]  morons well Alex the the carbon credit thing there's been so many scams with
[3:28:19.800 --> 3:28:25.880]  it already I mean for example when they first introduced it at the international
[3:28:25.880 --> 3:28:31.160]  level that is trading between nations they very quickly discovered that
[3:28:31.160 --> 3:28:35.720]  Germany and Turkey were cooking the books that they were deliberately giving
[3:28:35.720 --> 3:28:40.320]  false information about the CO2 that they were producing as nations and India
[3:28:40.320 --> 3:28:44.080]  and China won't even sign on and don't have to meaning all our jobs will go
[3:28:44.080 --> 3:28:50.680]  there exactly and and so the the they already had the scam going and one of
[3:28:50.680 --> 3:28:53.560]  the things by the way and I talked earlier about the tip of the iceberg
[3:28:53.560 --> 3:28:59.080]  what people don't know is that the statistics on the amount of CO2 that
[3:28:59.080 --> 3:29:03.840]  humans are producing globally and the current figure is given I think it's
[3:29:03.840 --> 3:29:11.120]  about 7.5 gigatons that number is produced by the IPCC they're cooking
[3:29:11.120 --> 3:29:15.760]  that number but even with that number they say humans are 3 to 6 percent of
[3:29:15.760 --> 3:29:20.520]  carbon dioxide increase right now you asked yourself first of all they say
[3:29:20.520 --> 3:29:23.960]  oh well they get the basic number from each country how many countries in the
[3:29:23.960 --> 3:29:28.040]  world know exactly what CO2 they're producing no they just make it up stay
[3:29:28.040 --> 3:29:33.000]  doctor Tim ball stay there long segment coming up let's get into a chronicle of
[3:29:33.000 --> 3:29:36.920]  all their fraud not just climategate and where they're going and then a little
[3:29:36.920 --> 3:29:40.800]  bit more about how they're taking over in your town you'll hear its green jobs
[3:29:40.800 --> 3:29:46.600]  and oh some windmills that's just the window dressing it means carbon taxes
[3:29:46.600 --> 3:29:53.000]  and carbon trading ripping you off 2.6 bill in Austin we're on the March the
[3:29:53.000 --> 3:30:01.840]  Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network one major world

[3:32:34.360 --> 3:32:38.880]  good intentions alone to get a supply of food will not feed us only getting our
[3:32:38.880 --> 3:32:42.760]  food supply immediately will make us independent and fearless for the future

[3:33:20.720 --> 3:33:38.240]  all right I've got a bunch of Twitter questions for Dr. Tim ball our new
[3:33:38.240 --> 3:33:42.920]  Twitter account is Twitter dot com forward slash real Alex Jones Twitter
[3:33:42.920 --> 3:33:47.320]  dot com forward slash real Alex Jones we have the prison planet Twitter and we
[3:33:47.320 --> 3:33:51.800]  have the info or stories Twitter they send out feeds of our articles as soon

[3:34:00.400 --> 3:34:04.320]  good info there's some photos we put up there on the Twitter of myself and Dean
[3:34:04.320 --> 3:34:10.360]  Haglin before we go back to Dr. Tim ball and asking some of these questions and
[3:34:10.360 --> 3:34:14.520]  get into kind of a chronicle of the fraud I want people to understand if we
[3:34:14.520 --> 3:34:18.880]  don't get the word out about this they win every time we get out and expose
[3:34:18.880 --> 3:34:24.040]  them and all the things are involved in they fail so they're trying to go at
[3:34:24.040 --> 3:34:27.600]  us at the state county and city level I want to tell you about a few of our

[3:35:17.200 --> 3:35:22.920]  they shut down the power plants to make you go on it is a scam what you need is
[3:35:22.920 --> 3:35:26.760]  great little units that have little battery unit little control unit the
[3:35:26.760 --> 3:35:31.800]  panel runs several several good size appliances get a bunch of them run your
[3:35:31.800 --> 3:35:36.320]  whole house great for campsites great for the road check it out at my solar

[3:35:41.760 --> 3:35:50.400]  877-327-0365 globalists don't own the sun yet folks so take action today again
[3:35:50.400 --> 3:35:53.120]  their takeover has nothing to do with solar panels that's just their window
[3:35:53.120 --> 3:35:58.400]  dressing it's all about taxes and lastly I want you know about a cola blue
[3:35:58.400 --> 3:36:02.160]  they're giving 20% of the money and they've already sent a big huge unit
[3:36:02.160 --> 3:36:07.640]  there and a bunch of little units to Haiti to the convoy of hope and you get
[3:36:07.640 --> 3:36:11.040]  20% when you buy one of their atmospheric water generators that gets you
[3:36:11.040 --> 3:36:14.040]  off the grid and grabs water out of the air that you can run one of these with
[3:36:14.040 --> 3:36:20.120]  the with a solar backup system a cola blue.com ECOLOBLUE.com or give
[3:36:20.120 --> 3:36:25.680]  them a call at 800-691-6043 or go to convoyofhope.org to check out what
[3:36:25.680 --> 3:36:28.920]  they're doing and because of the overwhelming need in Haiti a cola
[3:36:28.920 --> 3:36:32.880]  blue is donating 20% of every a cola blue 28 and a cola blue 30 units sold to
[3:36:32.880 --> 3:36:37.680]  convoy of hope the benefit the relief efforts in Haiti plus is a great system
[3:36:37.680 --> 3:36:41.520]  for you to get check out these amazing units the cleanest water you can get
[3:36:41.520 --> 3:36:45.440]  bar none right out of the atmosphere and then filtered a cola blue.com
[3:36:45.440 --> 3:36:49.400]  okay moving quickly now before I get to the Twitter questions for Dr. Tim
[3:36:49.400 --> 3:36:54.480]  Ball sir let's get into the fraud because any one of these stories and it's
[3:36:54.480 --> 3:36:59.920]  got to be more than 10 of them in the last week scandals dwarfing climate
[3:36:59.920 --> 3:37:04.440]  gate but all complimenting and proving climategate even more you know the red
[3:37:04.440 --> 3:37:09.720]  handed emails of fraud I mean it is just mind-blowing and as you said this is
[3:37:09.720 --> 3:37:15.960]  all based on a fraud Dr. Tim Ball. Well yeah it's based on on the theory or
[3:37:15.960 --> 3:37:21.240]  hypothesis of that human that CO2 is causing climate change warming and then
[3:37:21.240 --> 3:37:25.280]  climate change and of course this is this is what the problem they got into
[3:37:25.280 --> 3:37:30.160]  they chose that vehicle and then of course what they had to do was to make
[3:37:30.160 --> 3:37:35.600]  sure that the that the science proved what they were claiming and that goes
[3:37:35.600 --> 3:37:40.120]  completely against the normal scientific method. A scientist creates
[3:37:40.120 --> 3:37:44.680]  hypothesis then other scientists try to disprove it what they've been doing is
[3:37:44.680 --> 3:37:48.840]  trying to prove it and of course every time somebody asks a question like
[3:37:48.840 --> 3:37:56.520]  myself they either have to fudge the data to give a false answer or silence the
[3:37:56.520 --> 3:38:00.120]  person that's asking the question and they haven't hesitated to do either of
[3:38:00.120 --> 3:38:04.240]  those as you and I have discussed and one of the things that was set up at the
[3:38:04.240 --> 3:38:09.960]  climatic research unit was a website called real climate and they talk about
[3:38:09.960 --> 3:38:14.400]  it in the emails how they they were the goons they were the hit squad that
[3:38:14.400 --> 3:38:19.800]  covered the backs of these guys that were were creating the lies and covering
[3:38:19.800 --> 3:38:25.120]  the falsehoods and of course then they also got into the problem that once they
[3:38:25.120 --> 3:38:30.280]  convinced once they as bureaucrats for example Hanson at NASA guess once they
[3:38:30.280 --> 3:38:34.000]  convinced the politicians and the politicians had put their political
[3:38:34.000 --> 3:38:38.240]  career on the line then they were on the treadmill even more they had to keep
[3:38:38.240 --> 3:38:44.080]  falsifying the data even though evidence continued to come out that the
[3:38:44.080 --> 3:38:49.600]  science was completely wrong but now a lot of the top scientist who even
[3:38:49.600 --> 3:38:53.560]  been supporting those are coming out saying I guess it is okay to have a
[3:38:53.560 --> 3:38:59.400]  scientific debate that is the scientific method well exactly but but one of the
[3:38:59.400 --> 3:39:02.800]  things that's very interesting about this and I wrote an article in Canada
[3:39:02.800 --> 3:39:06.640]  free press a little while ago about it and that is the degree to which these
[3:39:06.640 --> 3:39:12.920]  people were able to bully individuals and powerful people at corporations and
[3:39:12.920 --> 3:39:17.520]  you know governments because they had the government purse strings
[3:39:17.520 --> 3:39:22.280]  exactly they could use I know it or for example in Canada they would put out
[3:39:22.280 --> 3:39:27.120]  documents and of course if the Canadian public have a much more a much
[3:39:27.120 --> 3:39:31.200]  greater faith in public in government stuff in the Americans do you got a
[3:39:31.200 --> 3:39:35.600]  healthy disrespect for government which is great but but yeah they could use the
[3:39:35.600 --> 3:39:42.320]  taxpayers money to lie to them and so they but they got on this treadmill but
[3:39:42.320 --> 3:39:46.680]  what's gradually happened of course and now all those scientists that were
[3:39:46.680 --> 3:39:50.920]  bullied into silence and I can't tell you how many that spoke to me Alex I
[3:39:50.920 --> 3:39:55.720]  remember government employees that give a presentation after this they said we
[3:39:55.720 --> 3:39:59.920]  agree with you but we're afraid to say anything so that's why this is imploding
[3:39:59.920 --> 3:40:04.520]  so badly for them now is so many people were tired of being bullied more
[3:40:04.520 --> 3:40:09.200]  stuffs getting leaked literally every day devastating a more and more so what
[3:40:09.200 --> 3:40:14.440]  do you think they're gonna do as all the fraud just mounts it already has to just
[3:40:14.440 --> 3:40:18.600]  completely biblical proportions what are they gonna do just rebrand it and keep
[3:40:18.600 --> 3:40:22.480]  stealing well the first thing that's gonna happen is already happening and
[3:40:22.480 --> 3:40:27.040]  that is they're appointing that they're doing the old phony thing of oh we'll
[3:40:27.040 --> 3:40:31.600]  have a commission of inquiry the Warren Commission or the 9-11 Commission or
[3:40:31.600 --> 3:40:36.000]  exactly okay and as I think we might have talked about I've served on these
[3:40:36.000 --> 3:40:40.240]  commissions and I realized that they're the perfect vehicle for politicians to
[3:40:40.240 --> 3:40:45.600]  avoid an issue to push it aside because well the commissions in they say to
[3:40:45.600 --> 3:40:50.120]  the media well I can't talk about it till we get the report but what I found
[3:40:50.120 --> 3:40:54.600]  out with the very first Commission I was on that the terms of reference that they
[3:40:54.600 --> 3:41:00.200]  wrote meant that I couldn't possibly reach to get to the truth that's like
[3:41:00.200 --> 3:41:05.040]  the 9-11 Commission said we know 19 hijackers did this and all we're doing
[3:41:05.040 --> 3:41:09.600]  is recommending what should be done and then that was pure police state yep yep
[3:41:09.600 --> 3:41:13.480]  and it's in the terms of reference that these this is how they control these
[3:41:13.480 --> 3:41:17.360]  commissions the Commission looks like it's nice always its arms length no we're
[3:41:17.360 --> 3:41:20.640]  not controlling it but in fact they're controlling it through the terms of
[3:41:20.640 --> 3:41:24.760]  reference and the classic story when they asked Judge Warren about the about
[3:41:24.760 --> 3:41:29.920]  the Kennedy assassination so what about the Matthew and Dallas he said well that
[3:41:29.920 --> 3:41:35.520]  wasn't in my terms of reference and bingo I knew exactly what he was saying and
[3:41:35.520 --> 3:41:39.680]  and because I'd gone through that but they look like they're good things now
[3:41:39.680 --> 3:41:42.560]  what they're setting up in Britain they're doing one they've already appointed
[3:41:42.560 --> 3:41:47.040]  somebody to to look at the climate and he's one of the top global warming
[3:41:47.040 --> 3:41:53.560]  people exactly exactly this is this is part of the continued cover-up and and
[3:41:53.560 --> 3:41:59.000]  so that will be the first thing but as the leaks and as the information come
[3:41:59.000 --> 3:42:03.320]  out and what's interesting with this Alex is you look at the Pew Center poll
[3:42:03.320 --> 3:42:09.000]  that came out recently where it showed that in the list of 21 concerns global
[3:42:09.000 --> 3:42:14.480]  warming was the very dead last and it was only a concern for 28% of the people
[3:42:14.480 --> 3:42:20.240]  and yet the politicians are ignoring that in the same way that they you know
[3:42:20.240 --> 3:42:25.360]  you see it in the US the anger amongst the people about what's going on and
[3:42:25.360 --> 3:42:30.200]  yet it's being ignored and the Pete the politicians are not listening to the
[3:42:30.200 --> 3:42:36.200]  public voice now one of the reasons that's gone on is because the politicians
[3:42:36.200 --> 3:42:39.880]  were terrified that somebody was good was able to say oh well you don't care
[3:42:39.880 --> 3:42:43.680]  about the environment you don't care about the children this is the emotional
[3:42:43.680 --> 3:42:47.960]  blackmail that went on and and Michael Crichton wrote about this in his book
[3:42:47.960 --> 3:42:53.680]  state of fear how they use this to manipulate the politicians and the only
[3:42:53.680 --> 3:42:59.440]  politician in the world that had the guts to stand up was back left close of
[3:42:59.440 --> 3:43:05.240]  the Czech Republic and he said this is a criminal takeover of all the resources
[3:43:05.240 --> 3:43:10.160]  by a new Soviet well exactly and I remember listening to them in New
[3:43:10.160 --> 3:43:16.280]  York at the first World Conference of the so-called skeptics and he said we've
[3:43:16.280 --> 3:43:19.800]  gone through 70 years of communism why the hell would you want to go back to
[3:43:19.800 --> 3:43:23.300]  that but now they repackage it is loving
[3:43:23.300 --> 3:43:27.520]  liberalness but it's the big banks financing it because they want a
[3:43:27.520 --> 3:43:31.760]  controlled market government absolute government can give them absolute
[3:43:31.760 --> 3:43:35.440]  monopolies I want to throw out questions to you from some of the Twitter
[3:43:35.440 --> 3:43:39.560]  people because we have the new Twitter account Twitter.com forward slash real
[3:43:39.560 --> 3:43:45.480]  Alex Jones those sign up there for real-time interaction somebody wants to
[3:43:45.480 --> 3:43:51.680]  ask you about the polar shift and the elites using this control on us I mean I
[3:43:51.680 --> 3:43:55.040]  know they admit they have some tectonic weapons they claim they have but I don't
[3:43:55.040 --> 3:43:58.600]  there's any proof that they could cause a polar shift but we do know that
[3:43:58.600 --> 3:44:03.160]  naturally happens and I've read reports that the poles have been moving lately
[3:44:03.160 --> 3:44:09.880]  more than they had previously. Yeah the magnetic pole rotates or in a circle
[3:44:09.880 --> 3:44:15.400]  over a period of time around the true pole and yes that there was a fairly
[3:44:15.400 --> 3:44:20.760]  rapid movement of it it I think about ten years ago it was centered in King
[3:44:20.760 --> 3:44:26.520]  William Island in the Canadian Arctic and it's been tracking south but the
[3:44:26.520 --> 3:44:32.520]  rate of that movement of that pole is variable and that's a normal wobble so
[3:44:32.520 --> 3:44:36.840]  when the media says oh my god the poles moving that's normal. Yeah now what is
[3:44:36.840 --> 3:44:42.960]  important is and I raised this before a parliamentary committee 20 years ago and
[3:44:42.960 --> 3:44:46.040]  I did it sort of tongue-in-cheek at the time trying to explain to them how
[3:44:46.040 --> 3:44:50.840]  science works with hypothesis we know the strength of the Earth's magnetic field
[3:44:50.840 --> 3:44:56.480]  has been weakening for about a thousand years and some people think that this is
[3:44:56.480 --> 3:45:02.600]  heading towards a polar reversal that is the magnetic poles literally flip so the
[3:45:02.600 --> 3:45:07.880]  south pole becomes the north pole magnetically and vice versa and I raised
[3:45:07.880 --> 3:45:12.680]  it as I said tongue-in-cheek at a parliamentary committee say look I can
[3:45:12.680 --> 3:45:16.680]  stand up here all day and create scary scenarios which one are you going to deal
[3:45:16.680 --> 3:45:21.680]  with because you've got to set some priorities here and this is part of the
[3:45:21.680 --> 3:45:26.040]  game that's being played by the way and how the fear distorts the priority
[3:45:26.040 --> 3:45:31.200]  list. What about the UN a few days ago first Danny Glover now UN spokesman
[3:45:31.200 --> 3:45:36.920]  saying global warming caused the plate shift that caused the earthquake and
[3:45:36.920 --> 3:45:40.840]  Haiti two and a half weeks ago I mean I'm no climatologist but I mean I've read
[3:45:40.840 --> 3:45:46.040]  the science no one has ever said that the atmosphere is that is in any way a
[3:45:46.040 --> 3:45:53.240]  driver of of tectonic plates floating around on the mantle. Well the only
[3:45:53.240 --> 3:45:58.160]  way that there can be any possible connection is that the atmosphere creates
[3:45:58.160 --> 3:46:02.160]  the winds and the winds drive the ocean currents at the surface but they don't
[3:46:02.160 --> 3:46:07.160]  drive the deep ocean currents and you can get situations where water can pile
[3:46:07.160 --> 3:46:11.360]  up in a particular area because of the of the wind patterns but those are
[3:46:11.360 --> 3:46:15.360]  relatively constant but when we're talking about movement of the tectonic
[3:46:15.360 --> 3:46:18.760]  plates we're talking about movement within the mantle of the earth that is
[3:46:18.760 --> 3:46:23.520]  underneath the crust and the bottom line is is this red I mean it's ridiculous
[3:46:23.520 --> 3:46:28.320]  this I mean I'm right it's ridiculous it's literally out of left field to say
[3:46:28.320 --> 3:46:34.120]  earthquakes are man's carbon dioxide and cows farting. Well it's absolute rubbish
[3:46:34.120 --> 3:46:38.600]  and as I said I could I could we could spend all day creating these kind of
[3:46:38.600 --> 3:46:42.320]  scary scenarios and you know which ones you're going to deal with it's not this
[3:46:42.320 --> 3:46:46.600]  is part of the issue of course Alex you see is they they're saying oh we got a
[3:46:46.600 --> 3:46:50.800]  creative risk-free world it never was a risk-free world well I mean I now they
[3:46:50.800 --> 3:46:53.320]  now they've shifted because it's not global warming now they admit it's
[3:46:53.320 --> 3:46:59.080]  getting colder to climate stability and no climb will be everybody knows climate
[3:46:59.080 --> 3:47:03.680]  changes constantly look at the dinosaurs what they lived in well I mean
[3:47:03.680 --> 3:47:08.280]  it's just asinine. Yeah yeah well and of course this is part of the way that the
[3:47:08.280 --> 3:47:11.000]  reason they've got away with it and we might have talked about this briefly
[3:47:11.000 --> 3:47:15.200]  once before but the western view of the world is that change is very gradual
[3:47:15.200 --> 3:47:19.920]  over long periods of time and that's a fundamental assumption that was made in
[3:47:19.920 --> 3:47:24.040]  order to accommodate Darwin and evolutionary theory and so on and it was
[3:47:24.040 --> 3:47:27.920]  done by a geologist by the name of Charles Lyell it's called uniformitarianism
[3:47:27.920 --> 3:47:32.240]  that's built into the way that the public are educated about that's why they
[3:47:32.240 --> 3:47:35.840]  believe that we were only hit every million years or so by a mega asteroid
[3:47:35.840 --> 3:47:39.760]  now that they're studying the other planets they go no looks like it's every
[3:47:39.760 --> 3:47:44.920]  300 years on average we're gonna get hit by something really big. Okay now if you
[3:47:44.920 --> 3:47:48.360]  got the public believing that change is very gradual over long periods of time
[3:47:48.360 --> 3:47:52.840]  it allows them to say any change which is occurring naturally oh that's that's
[3:47:52.840 --> 3:47:57.040]  not natural so what they're doing is they're telling you that natural events
[3:47:57.040 --> 3:48:00.960]  are unnatural and of course that means they could never be wrong and tomorrow
[3:48:00.960 --> 3:48:05.400]  there's gonna be more. But I mean look at volcanoes blowing up on the Aztecs and
[3:48:05.400 --> 3:48:08.520]  the Romans and the Greeks and the Japanese I mean there's there's
[3:48:08.520 --> 3:48:12.600]  constantly asteroids hitting and earthquakes and floods I mean this is
[3:48:12.600 --> 3:48:17.240]  normal. Exactly and and when you start to plot out for example they're saying
[3:48:17.240 --> 3:48:21.120]  oh there's more tornadoes and they're more severe when you look at the record
[3:48:21.120 --> 3:48:25.000]  that's simply not the case and in the U.S. they just got better radar to record
[3:48:25.000 --> 3:48:29.360]  them all now. Well that and also there are more people out there to see them.
[3:48:29.360 --> 3:48:34.920]  Okay and but one of the things in the U.S. for example the worst loss of life
[3:48:34.920 --> 3:48:41.520]  to tornadoes in the U.S. was in 1905. I know 154 people. Look that's why all
[3:48:41.520 --> 3:48:46.080]  these farmhouses in Texas and Kansas and Oklahoma and Illinois have got storm
[3:48:46.080 --> 3:48:51.680]  shelters in them. Exactly exactly but but as I said this this idea that they
[3:48:51.680 --> 3:48:57.040]  can present to you that normal changes is not normal and therefore if it's not
[3:48:57.040 --> 3:49:01.280]  normal that automatically equates to oh it must be something that humans are
[3:49:01.280 --> 3:49:05.960]  doing. All right and this is the common denominator. Oh it's always got to be the
[3:49:05.960 --> 3:49:10.760]  blame of humans and you see Osama bin Laden say oh it's the Americans
[3:49:10.760 --> 3:49:16.400]  causing global warming. Okay every time you look at any of these things it
[3:49:16.400 --> 3:49:20.560]  always comes back to it something that humans are doing that are causing these
[3:49:20.560 --> 3:49:24.640]  natural. But I mean look how ridiculous that is AP says we don't even know this
[3:49:24.640 --> 3:49:28.360]  has been laden but the news is saying it's him they might as well have the
[3:49:28.360 --> 3:49:33.840]  Cheshire cat say it. Well you know I was on a radio program a few years ago and
[3:49:33.840 --> 3:49:38.480]  afterwards they showed me on the computer they might they played my voice
[3:49:38.480 --> 3:49:42.080]  now voice recognition and that the computer printing that out is his old
[3:49:42.080 --> 3:49:45.720]  hat there's nothing new but then they could take individual letters out of
[3:49:45.720 --> 3:49:49.240]  the words I spoke and make up new words and the computer would say that in my
[3:49:49.240 --> 3:49:54.240]  voice and electronically you wouldn't know that wasn't me and I there's a
[3:49:54.240 --> 3:49:57.840]  lawsuit I believe it's still in the courts now where they want to produce
[3:49:57.840 --> 3:50:03.240]  Elvis singing songs he never sang in his lifetime and and by taking
[3:50:03.240 --> 3:50:07.000]  individual notes out of it. Exactly they could fake video audio but they were so
[3:50:07.000 --> 3:50:10.600]  lazy they didn't even do that quickly some more. There's no way of knowing that
[3:50:10.600 --> 3:50:19.520]  I think Osama bin Laden was dead he's got liver he's on dialysis. I don't you
[3:50:19.520 --> 3:50:24.320]  know and 25 million dollar award you haven't heard a word about anybody
[3:50:24.320 --> 3:50:28.480]  trying to get that. Now Dr. Ball we're gonna come back in the final segment and
[3:50:28.480 --> 3:50:32.240]  I want to go over a few of these other questions like how much of an increase in
[3:50:32.240 --> 3:50:36.720]  taxes the middle-class people do the global warming hoax and and you can
[3:50:36.720 --> 3:50:42.400]  answer that as a Canadian. Also we got another question can you get into how a
[3:50:42.400 --> 3:50:47.200]  mild warming is good for farms and how cooling cycles are the abnormality in
[3:50:47.200 --> 3:50:52.360]  real change. I don't know if that's the case I think change is the constant and a
[3:50:52.360 --> 3:50:55.520]  few other questions for Dr. Tim Ball on the other side of this quick break
[3:50:55.520 --> 3:51:01.600]  prisonplanet.tv infowars.com we're very honored to have Dr. Ball with us today.

[3:52:16.520 --> 3:52:21.560]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots. I

[3:54:51.680 --> 3:54:56.480]  secret cabal of bankers run the planet. That's on infoawards.com. The Kramer
[3:54:56.480 --> 3:55:00.840]  clips up there. It's insane. Dr. Tim Bowles, why do you think they're just coming out
[3:55:00.840 --> 3:55:08.080]  with everything now and just throwing it in our face? Well, in the sense of, you
[3:55:08.080 --> 3:55:11.800]  know, BS baffles brains, I guess, you know, if you throw enough people, the
[3:55:11.800 --> 3:55:16.160]  information out there, people get so confused they tend to turn off from it.
[3:55:16.160 --> 3:55:21.640]  And that's been one of the issues with the whole climate issue. Because I, for
[3:55:21.640 --> 3:55:26.000]  example, Alex, I would not participate in debates. Not that I was afraid of a
[3:55:26.000 --> 3:55:31.040]  debate, but if I debated with a Greenpeace person, it was all about emotion and
[3:55:31.040 --> 3:55:36.280]  pointing fingers and not caring and all that rubbish. And that, but if I debated
[3:55:36.280 --> 3:55:41.680]  with a scientist, then it was completely over people's heads. And one of the
[3:55:41.680 --> 3:55:46.600]  problems with this whole climate issue is people say, look, I'm lost here. I'm
[3:55:46.600 --> 3:55:50.240]  so confused. And I'm hearing this on one side and not on the other side. And I
[3:55:50.240 --> 3:55:54.200]  don't know enough. Well, bottom line, we've caught these people in fraud. It's
[3:55:54.200 --> 3:55:58.440]  over. Dismantle it. Don't let them pass it and toss it anywhere else. This
[3:55:58.440 --> 3:56:02.440]  question about increased taxes on the middle class, we know 200 billion in
[3:56:02.440 --> 3:56:07.520]  the last 20 years has been spent in the U.S. alone pushing this propaganda.
[3:56:08.520 --> 3:56:15.120]  Well, of course, anything that puts a tax on energy is going to be the perfect
[3:56:15.120 --> 3:56:21.000]  vehicle for a politician to grab taxes. I mean, I look at it, we talked
[3:56:21.000 --> 3:56:25.920]  earlier about the 3% carbon tax that was put on here in British Columbia. And
[3:56:26.640 --> 3:56:32.240]  it does generating huge amounts of revenue because it isn't just on the
[3:56:32.240 --> 3:56:36.120]  energy, the production of the energy and distribution of it. And that's your gas
[3:56:36.120 --> 3:56:41.600]  pump where such so much of it goes to taxes. But that then passes down into
[3:56:41.600 --> 3:56:47.160]  every single thing that's produced. It is completely pervasive throughout the
[3:56:47.160 --> 3:56:50.360]  whole production part of the society. And then they want to sell derivatives
[3:56:50.360 --> 3:56:55.360]  that are taxpayer backed for the bankers. Last question here. I got a question
[3:56:55.360 --> 3:57:01.560]  here saying, isn't mild warming good for the earth? I got the most vicious
[3:57:01.560 --> 3:57:05.040]  attacks when I wrote an article saying, look, there are some positive things
[3:57:05.040 --> 3:57:11.040]  about warming. And the idea that warming is only negative has been one of the
[3:57:11.040 --> 3:57:16.080]  biases that they pushed. Cooling is the greater threat. And we've seen this
[3:57:16.080 --> 3:57:22.120]  historically, the little ice age back in the 16th and 17th century and look
[3:57:22.120 --> 3:57:26.960]  at the conditions during the American War of Independence and what
[3:57:26.960 --> 3:57:31.960]  Washington faced and food production. Absolutely. Cooling is a much greater
[3:57:31.960 --> 3:57:36.840]  threat. And yet we're preparing totally for warming and it's just ludicrous.
[3:57:36.840 --> 3:57:39.880]  Dr. Tim Ball, we're out of time. Have a great weekend. Thank you for your
[3:57:39.880 --> 3:57:44.120]  tireless fight in the face of all their intimidation and threats. You've been
[3:57:44.120 --> 3:57:48.400]  proven right. God bless you. Have a great weekend. Thank you, Alex. Take care. He
[3:57:48.400 --> 3:57:50.960]  writes for Canadian Free Press and other great publications. Just Google
[3:57:50.960 --> 3:57:56.160]  Dr. Tim Ball. All right, close out of the show. Here is Kramer on Mad Money
[3:57:56.160 --> 3:57:58.600]  talking about the Illuminati. Here it is.
[3:57:58.600 --> 3:58:05.120]  This is AIGAIG, Goldman Goldman. And you know what? The Bavarian Illuminati, the
[3:58:05.120 --> 3:58:08.520]  Trilateral Commission, Goldman Sachs and the Queen of England are not all bad.
[3:58:08.520 --> 3:58:13.640]  Wow. We got to squeeze a couple of things. Sure. All right. First of all, let's do
[3:58:13.640 --> 3:58:18.360]  this one. Apple. This iPad. Right. See that? Well, look, I've got to tell you. See
[3:58:18.360 --> 3:58:23.520]  that? An iPad. That's good. You want an iPad? I'm throwing it to wait 60 days in
[3:58:23.520 --> 3:58:31.440]  our face. Throwing it in our face. Constant little comments like that.

[3:58:53.340 --> 3:58:57.000]  some important questions. If you're going into a battle and they give you a
[3:58:57.000 --> 3:59:01.680]  rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want? My answer would be all I can
[3:59:01.680 --> 3:59:06.160]  get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones. Food is your
[3:59:06.160 --> 3:59:10.480]  only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the
[3:59:10.480 --> 3:59:13.840]  battle starts. When will you need it? Can you buy it without proper
[3:59:13.840 --> 3:59:17.880]  identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick? If there's
[3:59:17.880 --> 3:59:21.720]  a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and
[3:59:21.720 --> 3:59:25.920]  be immunized? You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[3:59:25.920 --> 3:59:30.840]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you
[3:59:30.840 --> 3:59:35.960]  need? We don't know. How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones. I want all
[3:59:35.960 --> 3:59:43.240]  of you good guys to live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it
