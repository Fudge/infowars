[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:20.840]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.840 --> 00:31.720]  we have another important transmission lined up for you today it is Wednesday the 25th day of
[00:31.720 --> 00:38.480]  August 2010 we're gonna be live here for the next three hours and we don't have any guest
[00:38.480 --> 00:46.000]  scheduled I may have a few people popping in with some key info later in the broadcast but
[00:46.000 --> 00:55.040]  no full guest interviews 30-minute or hour-long interviews coming up today let me just give
[00:55.040 --> 01:02.680]  you a rundown of some of the amazing news that's coming up in the weird stack Hitler had Jewish
[01:02.680 --> 01:12.240]  and African roots London Telegraph DNA test show by testing his known relatives here in the United
[01:12.240 --> 01:19.200]  States and Europe taken from 39 relatives of the Nazi leader showing African and Jewish roots
[01:19.200 --> 01:26.640]  well it is a fact that his father Alois Hitler was the illegitimate son of a servant girl in
[01:26.640 --> 01:34.840]  the Rothschild household I've researched it it's in mainline history also of course his third wife
[01:34.840 --> 01:44.120]  Hitler's mother was also his niece and was reportedly also related because the the the
[01:44.120 --> 01:49.440]  wealthy and the royal of Europe constantly had illegitimate children and Hitler even had a lot
[01:49.440 --> 01:55.320]  of people killed to try to cover this up this was a big scandal for Adolf Hitler but now the DNA
[01:55.320 --> 02:00.080]  test have come in a lot of times I don't believe mainstream media and I don't really know what
[02:00.080 --> 02:05.720]  to make of this but we do know that where there's smoke there's fire and that this is a interesting
[02:05.720 --> 02:12.040]  issue so we'll be talking some about that today but it's obviously not our top story a report I
[02:12.040 --> 02:19.320]  meant to get to yesterday that I will cover during this hour is a very credible retired FBI agent
[02:19.320 --> 02:27.920]  who specifically discovered plans to kill Kennedy in the months before the operation has gone public
[02:27.920 --> 02:34.800]  and and now they've declassified because we're 40 plus years later the original FBI reports where
[02:34.800 --> 02:40.760]  they knew who some of the shooters were and what was being planned in Chicago and Dallas he was
[02:40.760 --> 02:46.360]  meant to be killed a week before in Chicago as other secret service agents and FBI agents have
[02:46.360 --> 02:51.960]  also gone public with so this is a very credible FBI agent who worked the case before and after
[02:51.960 --> 02:58.960]  including in Dallas he wasn't from Dallas he was sent to Dallas and I'm going to work on getting
[02:58.960 --> 03:04.680]  him on the broadcast I'm going to play a news clip of this and cover it Paul Watson posted it
[03:04.680 --> 03:11.960]  yesterday at presentplanet.com the economic stack is absolutely frightening we're going to be going
[03:11.960 --> 03:21.600]  over that as things deteriorate even faster last year I sent Rob do and Jason Douglas to Northern
[03:21.600 --> 03:28.920]  California to Sacramento the Capitol where at night they basically lock up the homeless people
[03:28.920 --> 03:34.640]  and they don't let them sleep on the street or intense or on city or state land they basically
[03:34.640 --> 03:43.000]  arrest them and the same thing as being rolled out in Hawaii well now this is out of news one
[03:43.000 --> 03:50.240]  New York Republican candidate says prison dorms for welfare recipients and this is also being
[03:50.240 --> 03:55.200]  proposed in England the last few months we've seen a lot of reports about let's lock up the
[03:55.200 --> 04:01.080]  poor and let's make them work to pay for their room and board and this is a very very dangerous
[04:01.080 --> 04:08.960]  trend so we'll be breaking that down today also yesterday I covered the fact that Carver's Bay
[04:08.960 --> 04:16.280]  enlist entire ninth grade welcome to high school now drop and give me 20 they were forcibly put
[04:16.280 --> 04:21.840]  into the junior ROTC then they try to force them to sign commitment papers to join the military

[11:58.240 --> 12:03.760]  this is very important when i'm about to cover and i want to preface it with this statement
[12:04.400 --> 12:11.520]  right now we reverse engineered in the last 15 years everything that was being covertly built
[12:11.520 --> 12:20.000]  the private spy networks the merger of the military national guard local police under cia control
[12:20.000 --> 12:24.960]  in the fusion centers it's now all admitted washington post new york times but they say
[12:24.960 --> 12:30.800]  how great it is the face scanning cameras the license plate reading cameras the control grids
[12:30.800 --> 12:35.520]  the automatic kill switches being put in all the new cars that the government can just activate
[12:35.520 --> 12:43.680]  cell phones tracking you in real time uh google being an nsa front it is now all admitted there's
[12:43.680 --> 12:51.600]  no more denial world government world taxes unelected unaccountable total tyranny i remember back
[12:51.600 --> 12:58.000]  in 1998 all over the nation in literally thousands of school districts a multi-billion dollar program
[12:58.000 --> 13:03.680]  where they would take local police or local sheriff's deputies and deputize them to teach
[13:03.680 --> 13:09.520]  a law enforcement class uh to six seventh and eighth graders in a three-year program and then
[13:09.520 --> 13:16.320]  they would federally deputize and pay with a grant to multiple officers to be atf in the school
[13:16.320 --> 13:21.520]  having the children write dossiers on their parents i have copies of it in my film police
[13:21.520 --> 13:30.560]  state to the takeover from from 2000 actual school memos training them to spy on their parents
[13:30.560 --> 13:38.400]  it says they get access on the recess access at lunch turning them into confidential informants
[13:38.400 --> 13:43.520]  i have local newscast in austin and ads on tv saying you get 200 bucks when you turn your
[13:43.520 --> 13:48.480]  parents in here's your tattletale card and your identifying number with the children smiling
[13:49.120 --> 13:59.440]  that's in road to tyranny 2002 this is a full corporate takeover of everything auto industry
[13:59.440 --> 14:06.480]  banking agriculture only mega corporations are allowed to have businesses and operate
[14:06.480 --> 14:14.160]  under this system this is a total mafia takeover of society then in the last decade i've seen
[14:14.160 --> 14:21.120]  reports out of chicago la and many other major big cities where entire public schools if you're in
[14:21.120 --> 14:27.680]  that district you go to a military academy and at these military academies they train them
[14:27.680 --> 14:33.760]  in every news article to take on gun owners militias conservatives libertarians we were
[14:33.760 --> 14:39.440]  reporting this 12 years ago we were getting internal memos then it only caught national
[14:39.440 --> 14:46.240]  attention in 2009 when we got the mayac and homeland security reports stating the same thing from
[14:46.240 --> 14:54.560]  homeland security exposing the homeland security operation so this is 100 confirmed they've got
[14:54.560 --> 15:00.800]  over 50 000 preachers with a clergy response team total tyranny trained to teach their flocks
[15:01.360 --> 15:06.160]  that turning in your guns is good that going to fema camps that are good that taking inoculations
[15:06.160 --> 15:13.040]  are good we posted the hundreds of pages of secret documents two years later national and local news
[15:13.040 --> 15:18.160]  came out and said yes it's great we're training for martial law and they showed images from the
[15:18.160 --> 15:24.160]  movie the siege with bruce willis of americans in a camp and they said this is good the preachers
[15:24.160 --> 15:31.680]  will help put you in the camp now i mean this is a giant covert criminal operation but it's
[15:31.680 --> 15:36.560]  compartmentalized where even the average police officer or military person unless they're in
[15:36.560 --> 15:42.240]  intelligence knows almost nothing about it they're always given cover stories and cover reasons
[15:42.240 --> 15:47.680]  for for for what this program is really about the program that they're involved in i mean here's the
[15:47.680 --> 15:55.200]  analogy of that you're on a ocean liner that holds 3000 people they've got to be even bigger than
[15:55.200 --> 16:01.040]  that and there's cooks and there's maids and there's security people and there's folks in the casino
[16:01.600 --> 16:08.800]  and there's navigators and there's people in the engine room they only know their job and they're
[16:08.800 --> 16:16.720]  only given information about their job but the captain he knows exactly what he's doing he knows
[16:16.720 --> 16:23.200]  where they're going and he has all the information about what's happening on that ship and the corporation
[16:23.200 --> 16:29.680]  based back on the mainland it has all the full info about all the ships and everything they're
[16:29.680 --> 16:37.120]  doing so all i've done in 17 years 15 years on air is analyze all their admitted operations
[16:37.120 --> 16:44.320]  and put the pieces together then more and more the globalist in the cfr club of rome un at the highest
[16:44.320 --> 16:50.000]  management levels are so arrogant they've put out hundreds and hundreds that i've seen there's no
[16:50.000 --> 16:58.960]  doubt thousands of actual full spectrum dominance briefings to their highest level minions about
[16:58.960 --> 17:06.720]  the plan and so we know exactly what it is show you're a police officer you're like a cook on the
[17:06.720 --> 17:16.720]  ship you're a bureaucrat you're like somebody in the engine room you aren't bad but the captain
[17:16.720 --> 17:24.320]  is very bad and the company that owns the ship is the devil if you want to boil it down to what's
[17:24.320 --> 17:31.280]  at the end of the rabbit hole pure evil pure eugenics total full spectrum dominance to take
[17:31.280 --> 17:38.880]  over the planet shut off your resources bankrupt you in the family fully change the human species
[17:39.520 --> 17:49.360]  and exterminate the majority of the population this is the stated operation now just in the
[17:49.360 --> 17:56.480]  last 48 hours they have decided to go full bore public they have now admitted all over the news
[17:56.480 --> 18:01.520]  we've got pre-crime systems it's total clackery where you you're not guilty until proven innocent
[18:01.520 --> 18:07.840]  you're guilty when you've done nothing wrong it's going in everywhere it's already in place
[18:08.480 --> 18:14.800]  it's in literally hundreds and hundreds of newspapers they are now making the announcement
[18:14.800 --> 18:20.720]  and they're making other announcements look at this time magazine article the government's new
[18:20.720 --> 18:27.280]  right to track your every move with gps it says the government has rights now you don't have rights
[18:27.280 --> 18:32.160]  the government has a right and it goes on to say they can track yourself on in real time without
[18:32.160 --> 18:39.120]  warrants they can trespass on your property and put gps on your car no warrant you have no fourth
[18:39.120 --> 18:46.960]  amendment that's their new right see the global corporations are lawless and they write the rules
[18:46.960 --> 18:51.840]  now and they exempt themselves from all the rules they write for us government agents can
[18:51.840 --> 18:55.280]  sneak onto your property the middle of the night but a gps device on the bottom of your car and
[18:55.280 --> 18:58.640]  keep track of everywhere you go this doesn't violate your fourth amendment rights because
[18:58.640 --> 19:03.040]  you do not have any reasonable expectation of privacy in your own driveway your own private
[19:03.040 --> 19:08.240]  property has privacy and all the other court rulings but see they're now changing the precedents
[19:08.240 --> 19:16.000]  the controlling circuit courts i mean this is pure treason hey we are allowed to torture we're
[19:16.000 --> 19:21.360]  allowed to secretly arrest you twelve states will arrest you if you videotape cops from a half mile
[19:21.360 --> 19:26.480]  away they say oh it's wiretapping when the statute doesn't even say that there's no perception of
[19:26.480 --> 19:33.280]  privacy in public they're going to videotape you they're going to come on your property but you
[19:33.280 --> 19:38.640]  have no rights that is the bizarre and scary rule that now applies in california and eight other
[19:38.640 --> 19:43.200]  western states the u.s. court of appeals for the night circuit which covers the vast jurisdiction
[19:43.200 --> 19:47.360]  recently decided the government could monitor you in this way virtually anytime at once with no
[19:47.360 --> 19:54.000]  need for a search warrant now we come back nationwide the military has taken over the
[19:54.000 --> 20:03.440]  public schools this is hardcore stay with us is your debt problem a ticking time bomb thanks to

[34:09.920 --> 34:26.400]  we're gonna open the phones up throughout the full transmission 1-800-259-9231-800-259-9231
[34:27.280 --> 34:35.520]  all right here's the key we are psychologically being trained to accept death the average life
[34:35.520 --> 34:41.760]  expectancy is 51 for exon valdez workers when the average life expectancy is over 75 in this
[34:41.760 --> 34:50.800]  country 74 for men 76 77 for women almost all the exon valdez workers are dead obama and the
[34:50.800 --> 34:56.160]  epa come out and say there's no health problems in the gulf even though they've used hundreds of
[34:56.160 --> 35:02.400]  times the dispersant 40 plus million gallons all the crude oil they told them don't wear mask
[35:02.400 --> 35:08.480]  you'll scare the public there's no problem as you collapse and many have already died that's
[35:08.480 --> 35:15.200]  mainstream news but obama and the media say it's fine the government says it's fine but then other
[35:15.200 --> 35:20.080]  newspapers tell the truth and talk about the illnesses and the deaths and even bp doctors
[35:20.080 --> 35:23.600]  have gone public and come out and said people are getting sick and dying and there's a cover
[35:23.600 --> 35:29.600]  up going on and it's the same thing with depleted uranium there was a report in 1946
[35:29.600 --> 35:38.400]  dealing with radioactive gas weapons using du gas bombs against the soviets and the pentagon
[35:38.400 --> 35:42.800]  the newly built pentagon decided we will not use this it's too deadly as a blowback
[35:42.800 --> 35:47.200]  and the half life of du is billions of years what is it four and a half billion i'm going
[35:47.200 --> 35:55.120]  from memory i know it's over four billion years the half life okay it is fresh and has the maximum
[35:55.120 --> 36:03.120]  effect for billions of years for all intensive purposes for ever and now they're not just using
[36:03.120 --> 36:10.400]  it in abram sabo rounds or in warthog vulcan uh machine gun cannons they're serving it out to
[36:10.400 --> 36:17.360]  50 calibers uh to 223's you name it it's being used in proving grounds uh all over the u.s all
[36:17.360 --> 36:26.480]  over hawaii all over portorico the people complain they say shut up shut up and when you fire du
[36:26.480 --> 36:32.880]  it aerosolizes when it hits the targets it turns into powder it ignites because the
[36:32.880 --> 36:38.720]  friction is so great and burns and turns into a powder that's radioactive and poisonous we've
[36:38.720 --> 36:45.600]  had the former head of the pentagons du program dr dug rocky phd and now scientists are reporting
[36:45.600 --> 36:51.760]  there's reports in the u.s england and iraq a four-fold increase in cancers in cities where
[36:51.760 --> 36:57.520]  this was used mainly republican guard bases were bombed with it and where did our troops move in
[36:57.520 --> 37:02.800]  the republican guard bases with the blast holes bombed out they would dump sand on top of the
[37:02.800 --> 37:10.160]  blast holes supposedly containing the du a dump truck of sand on a blast hole on a crater and then
[37:10.160 --> 37:16.240]  of course the desert winds the sand blowing around you're seeing massive increases in lung
[37:16.240 --> 37:21.600]  cancer and skin cancer in organ failure again we've had the medical doctors on about this in our
[37:21.600 --> 37:32.720]  trips now i said this is the key to everything this is the key first they put cars at the border
[37:32.720 --> 37:37.840]  through high-powered x-ray machines where you drive under it and it scans then they put naked
[37:37.840 --> 37:43.440]  body scanners in and lie about the radiation and scores of top scientists are now la times
[37:43.440 --> 37:49.600]  new york times shane gets incredibly deadly there's two different machines 20 to 50 times the
[37:49.600 --> 37:54.560]  radiation they lie and say we're not recording the images now they admit they are so they're
[37:54.560 --> 38:00.640]  training you to be bathed in radiation and by the time you get angry by that they've already jumped
[38:00.640 --> 38:07.120]  onto the next thing so you're fighting that and the old tyranny now doesn't seem as bad so they
[38:07.120 --> 38:14.960]  take you a million miles down the road of despotism and dehumanization and scientific poisoning and
[38:14.960 --> 38:22.960]  death and radiation and you push back 500 000 miles with everything you've got they've still got you
[38:22.960 --> 38:28.880]  500 000 miles down the road to tyranny then they bring you another million miles you battle back
[38:28.880 --> 38:36.000]  another 600 000 miles you're still 900 000 miles down the rat hole then they take you 10 million
[38:36.000 --> 38:43.040]  miles you battle back 9 million miles now you're a million 900 000 miles down the rat hole to hell
[38:43.040 --> 38:48.640]  then they take you a trillion miles into tyranny you battle back hundreds of millions of miles
[38:49.520 --> 38:56.560]  it's over it's too late that's their plan and they're now not jumping hundreds of miles or
[38:56.560 --> 39:01.920]  thousands of miles they're now jumping millions of miles we've got to run screaming through
[39:01.920 --> 39:06.480]  the streets metaphorically we've got to pull our hair out we've got to stand there in grocery
[39:06.480 --> 39:10.800]  store lines and start yelling about the new world order we've got to do banner hangs everywhere
[39:10.800 --> 39:15.120]  we've got to call in to talk radio we've got to email everybody we know every day we've got to get
[39:15.120 --> 39:21.600]  self-sufficient we've got to warn everyone because they're trying to break our will now again here's
[39:21.600 --> 39:27.040]  the key in england this already started five years ago it's how new it would come here naked body
[39:27.040 --> 39:31.360]  mobile vans i told you to go in the courthouses federal and state now it's happened they're
[39:31.360 --> 39:37.680]  saving every image 34 000 images uh in in one city or lando alone at the federal courthouse
[39:37.680 --> 39:42.320]  of your children of your wife saving and all at the airport saving and all bathing you in
[39:42.320 --> 39:48.560]  radiation now if it isn't enough to have the border patrol in checkpoints up to 100 miles in
[39:48.560 --> 39:55.760]  in this constitution free zone the border patrol all the research shows are being backscattered
[39:55.760 --> 40:02.960]  with more power than chest x-rays every day and when you get sick like the troops that breathe
[40:02.960 --> 40:07.200]  do you they're just going to keep it quiet in the news or it'll even come out and they'll
[40:07.200 --> 40:11.840]  block you getting any aid just like they told the 9-11 workers hey you're breathing asbestos
[40:11.840 --> 40:18.000]  it's not bad for you many of them are dead well 3000 plus all the dogs died within five years
[40:18.000 --> 40:22.800]  that breathed it nasal cancer lung cancer the major university medical centers
[40:22.800 --> 40:28.720]  do the lung scans say they're full of asbestos full of all these chemicals they're dying
[40:28.720 --> 40:34.480]  government almost nine years later says you don't get any health care oh bush stands up
[40:34.480 --> 40:41.200]  there on the rubble and it poses as a patriot glenn beck who said he detests 9-11 victims
[40:41.200 --> 40:47.680]  stands on the rubble now you know goes to ground zero and grandstands it's only on the surface
[40:47.680 --> 40:51.520]  of their patriotism so they're setting the precedent to give you guard a sale and it
[40:51.520 --> 40:58.240]  causes autoimmune disorders brain damage death no nobody gets in trouble they come out with the h1
[40:58.240 --> 41:04.000]  n1 shot hundreds of thousands get sick gion beret tenfold increase in seizures neurological
[41:04.000 --> 41:09.040]  disorders it's all admitted british medical journal they don't care they keep rolling it out with it
[41:09.040 --> 41:14.640]  again this year they're just setting the precedent they're charging up the hill on us firing and
[41:14.640 --> 41:19.760]  attacking they're not backing down and they got loud speakers blaring we're your friends we're the
[41:19.760 --> 41:24.320]  government we love you we care about you we're doing this for your own good they got billboards
[41:24.320 --> 41:29.200]  up everywhere cattle on your parents cattle on your boss turn in your neighbor get some cash
[41:29.200 --> 41:34.480]  that's all off the charts they're turning us against each other at every level
[41:37.600 --> 41:43.520]  and now they come out and say we've got super high powered mobile trucks that are going to
[41:43.520 --> 41:51.360]  roll around america with super high powered x-rays so powerful i mean it's a super dose to be chest
[41:51.360 --> 41:58.960]  x-ray just to shoot through some meat at point blank range from a foot away they've got statistics
[41:58.960 --> 42:03.920]  that if you get more than a handful of chest x-rays your cancer levels just go off the chart
[42:06.080 --> 42:12.400]  these are systems conservatively thousands of times stronger and the people in the trucks
[42:12.400 --> 42:17.920]  are getting backscatter splatter when they're aiming this thing you're in your house you're on
[42:17.920 --> 42:24.080]  the highway and they're driving around hitting you with high powered radiation i mean they found
[42:24.080 --> 42:28.960]  out 20 plus years ago that cops were sticking radar guns between their legs on their motorcycles
[42:28.960 --> 42:34.400]  or squad cars i drive down 290 every day almost every day and see motorcycle cops
[42:36.800 --> 42:40.400]  sitting there on their motorcycles and when they're done aiming their radar gun at me
[42:40.400 --> 42:44.480]  they stick it between their legs even though they tell them don't do that and if you see
[42:44.480 --> 42:49.200]  the statistics on police officers to stick your cancer because even though they're not firing the
[42:49.200 --> 42:57.600]  ray that device is broadcasting some of it and it's cooking their genitalia how many thousands
[42:57.600 --> 43:04.960]  of studies about cell phones with the uh microwave scrambler relay heating the brain at least one
[43:04.960 --> 43:08.560]  degree after five minutes of average cell phone use and it varies cell phone to cell phone
[43:08.560 --> 43:13.200]  admitting it's going to give you cancer and they even let you know it's going to give you
[43:13.200 --> 43:21.040]  cancer but we're just like wild deer this is the key wild deer and they've done studies in
[43:21.040 --> 43:27.840]  north america they've done it in africa they've done it in asia as well as europe you can put poison
[43:27.840 --> 43:34.880]  in a water supply in a pool in a pond the deer will come and drink it even though they see other
[43:34.880 --> 43:42.000]  deer dying from it they can't make the connection just like rats can't make the connection and so
[43:42.000 --> 43:47.120]  even though you know buys phenol a is giving you cancer and hurting you and i will send an email
[43:47.120 --> 43:56.960]  i'm mispronouncing it is it this phenol buys phenol a admittedly buys phenol a even though
[43:56.960 --> 44:02.400]  that's happening they put it out there before us and i catch myself like a little monkey reaching
[44:02.400 --> 44:08.480]  up to get the little juice drink i want i catch myself you know my kids are begging for the corn
[44:08.480 --> 44:16.400]  syrup lifesavers i catch myself still giving it to them because the force of habit is so powerful
[44:17.040 --> 44:23.040]  that i grew up eating lifesavers and they look colorful and they look like fruit to my primitive
[44:23.040 --> 44:32.480]  brain my hardwiring i still have to fight to not give it to them when they're asking lovingly and
[44:32.480 --> 44:38.320]  it's the same thing these guys work for these body scanner companies they work for the tsa it's their
[44:38.320 --> 44:42.800]  job they do it killing themselves to live the people rolling out with these companies with these
[44:42.800 --> 44:49.120]  high-powered x-rays they're just like the troops they're going to go breathe the du they're going
[44:49.120 --> 44:54.880]  to go bathe in the radiation fourth amendment violating mobile x-ray scanners hit the streets
[44:56.160 --> 45:00.000]  as we warned at the beginning of this year x-ray body scanners currently being used
[45:00.560 --> 45:03.920]  and abused in airports across the world are set to hit the streets as american science
[45:04.560 --> 45:09.680]  and engineering reveals that more than 500 backscatter x-ray scanners mounted in vans that can be
[45:09.680 --> 45:14.160]  driven past neighborhoods vehicles to see their contents have been sold to government agencies
[45:14.160 --> 45:23.040]  more than 500 mobile vans so powerful that they shoot through metal and brick
[45:27.120 --> 45:32.160]  and if you try to go i mean they're assaulting you they drive by and hit your car your house
[45:32.160 --> 45:37.120]  with this you're being assaulted but you try to pull them over you try to stop them they'll call a
[45:37.120 --> 45:42.240]  swat team and say terrorists are attacking and those swat team guys drinking bisphenol a
[45:42.240 --> 45:47.280]  day drinking sodium fluoride shooting themselves up have no idea they'll they'll they will get in
[45:47.280 --> 45:55.280]  a gun battle with you and kill you faster you can imagine they're now rolling out worldwide
[45:55.280 --> 45:59.680]  the governments are admitting within 10 years they want you to retina scan to buy and sell
[45:59.680 --> 46:06.160]  and major banks and governments are continually the number one source of people getting your
[46:06.160 --> 46:14.080]  personal data for identity theft they create the crisis offer the solution they are assaulting
[46:14.080 --> 46:18.080]  you and your family when they put you in a body scanner they are assaulting your privacy and your
[46:18.080 --> 46:23.520]  dna it wrecks your dna it hurts the next generation that's new york times admitting it but saying it's

[46:29.760 --> 46:35.280]  thousands of times more powerful and they got 500 of these things already driving around looking in
[46:35.280 --> 46:40.880]  your house and you can go watch the video newscast about this it shows people inside rider trucks
[46:40.880 --> 46:46.400]  of course it's always in a simulation of terror see we need these there's people inside the car
[46:47.360 --> 46:51.920]  there's people hiding that rider truck they're driving around with a high powered
[46:52.880 --> 47:02.000]  radiation beam of high powered x-ray blasting the guy in the cars being fried he'll love that big
[47:02.000 --> 47:08.320]  fat juicy brain tumor he gets he'll love it have you noticed how they've taken our survival instinct
[47:08.320 --> 47:14.240]  away i see the statistics of more and more yuppies don't even visit their parents for many many years
[47:14.240 --> 47:20.640]  they just stick them in these nursing homes that's how the nursing homes get away with them with
[47:20.640 --> 47:26.560]  worms and maggots and bed sores and living in their own feces and urine for weeks at a time
[47:26.560 --> 47:31.760]  same thing coming out of england and their hospitals because nobody comes to see mama and papa
[47:31.760 --> 47:38.000]  these yuppies are so busy getting drunk and partying and watching porn and betting on football games
[47:38.000 --> 47:45.440]  hey daddy's over in another state rotten right now sitting there begging for death rotten slow
[47:45.440 --> 47:49.600]  and as soon as his insurance runs out they're going to quietly give him morphine and hospice

[48:06.640 --> 48:11.120]  this all over america and the shooting ranges and proving grounds we're going to use it all over the
[48:11.120 --> 48:15.600]  world we're going to have our troops move into areas we've bombed we're going to have people
[48:15.600 --> 48:20.320]  clean up the world trade center and say they don't need breathing apparatus we're going to tell
[48:20.320 --> 48:24.560]  the people in the gulf they don't need it because we'll have to admit it's dangerous and admit
[48:24.560 --> 48:31.040]  claims later we're going to bomb nuclear reactors in iran that have been loaded with uranium and
[48:31.040 --> 48:37.680]  cause chair nobles chair nobles aren't bad anymore this is the big secret we're all just being
[48:37.680 --> 48:44.000]  acclimated to mass death mass cancer mass poisoning i showed the national guard a few
[48:44.000 --> 48:48.160]  months ago off local news in new york showing them making citizens they said they made over
[48:48.160 --> 48:54.640]  2000 arrest drive under a radiation machine it's so high-powered it's not as high-powered as the
[48:54.640 --> 48:59.360]  ones that broadcast at a distance and shoot through walls and cars that it's a wand a big one they
[48:59.360 --> 49:05.600]  make you drive under it and the families are driving under it and the military is going yeah

[49:53.840 --> 50:02.240]  got full spectrum analysis systems special spectrographs that can see the bouncing x-rays you can
[50:02.240 --> 50:07.040]  look at those at university websites and you can just see the cops and the troops i mean it's just
[50:07.040 --> 50:13.520]  blasting light shooting all all over just radiating them and what's on the outside of a man is

[01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:23.600]  hey how you doing alex good um two points um all this stuff that you've been talking about
[01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:29.840]  regarding uh this insidious attack on the people okay of this country all the countries that are
[01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:34.560]  then divided well it's not just an attack it's not just the attack they're doing it in the open now
[01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:38.640]  yeah we're gonna drive by and blast your house with incredibly high-powered
[01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:44.160]  x-rays that are off the charts compared to a chest x-ray and we're just gonna do it and
[01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:48.800]  the government's got 500 of them they're already going driving around with them alex let me just
[01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:55.120]  tell you real quick okay um this has its origin when we won the war in germany they were working on
[01:02:55.120 --> 01:03:01.200]  all this stuff okay that we perfected because we absorbed those people okay they're scientists
[01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:07.200]  they're scientists all this stuff they were working on and finally it took hold politically and
[01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:12.640]  uh individually somehow made it through because we made this marriage when we took all those people
[01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:18.800]  in and i'm i think you just go to the libraries and see uh incredible information about the rat
[01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:24.400]  line but it's more than that eugenics and this worldview of total tyranny came of from england
[01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:31.600]  in the u.s hitler picked up on it they developed it further than we merged it was like two people
[01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:37.360]  that are peas in a pod getting back together really i want to make a second point real quick
[01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:42.080]  so what it is is what i've been what you said earlier about the preachers you know and then
[01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:45.840]  these people go and listen to the preachers and they're going to tell them take you know to get
[01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:51.040]  rid of your guns and uh you know all this stuff that's going to end them up in camps right well
[01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:57.200]  i gotta say this and it's a biblical thing um is that it's even in the bible regarding
[01:03:57.200 --> 01:04:03.280]  uh in the leotatians you know what i'm talking about that that name leotatians go ahead that's
[01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:07.360]  in the bob you can actually see it i understand go ahead tell us what it is okay well the head
[01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:12.000]  point goes to this right now there's a marriage and what's going on in europe and just like
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:17.680]  bernacky did with the secret numbers so they can just print money well germany's got to bail out
[01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:24.400]  all these other people okay and the the thing that's scary to me is this guy uh his name is uh baren

[01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:06.960]  recalled in three states we've got uh we've got e coli a million pounds of ground beef again
[01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:13.760]  uh prices uh right as they introduce and are trying to pass the bill where if you read it
[01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:18.800]  they could potentially ban having a farm without a government license the animal ID
[01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:23.840]  premise society expanding i mean they are really staging this the evidence is clear
[01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:29.760]  oh absolutely and uh and what they're going to do is uh you can not only uh not have a farm but
[01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:36.640]  you can't trade any uh homegrown stuff with each other or give it away or do anything with it
[01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:41.920]  total food and they won't send inspectors this is also in the news to the big factories but
[01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:48.240]  they're harassing people selling pumpkins and grapes and watermelons and eggs and cheese and milk
[01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:54.560]  they're swat teaming people nationwide and this is the only clean food you can get uh we're really
[01:13:54.560 --> 01:14:00.640]  concerned about that because what's happened is our the prices from our suppliers are just
[01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:06.800]  absolutely skyrocketing and what we did when we saw this happen we're not going to be able
[01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:11.760]  to hold off price increases we're all we're going to have to have a huge price increase
[01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:15.920]  we can't do a stinking thing about it we've held it off for two and a half years alex
[01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:21.920]  and it's been going downhill in terms of our margins and everything since but what what we did
[01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:28.480]  was we uh put together some some assets and uh got in touch with our suppliers
[01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:36.880]  and we made a huge buy at the existing prices and uh rather than just uh raise the price when we
[01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:42.800]  have to and take an extra margin we're going to sell all of this out and that we've gone back to
[01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:49.040]  something that everybody loved and was just a tremendous possibility for folks while we have
[01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:54.240]  this supply that we just ordered in there and processing right now available while it's still
[01:14:54.240 --> 01:15:00.400]  lasting we're going to go back to the buy three get one free on the on the selected items so
[01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:07.360]  if folks want to get stocked up for the last chance on on the pricing that we've had right now
[01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:12.160]  and i'm telling you that this isn't this isn't any playing playing games we've been struggling
[01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:18.240]  with this alex for the last month and a half trying to figure out how to avoid it we just can't
[01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:26.560]  uh if we if we if we don't increase the prices uh we can't even afford to to buy from our suppliers
[01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:31.680]  the the quality of products that we've been able to put together so that people can have safe and
[01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:38.480]  clean food so what we're doing right now is we're announcing this we're going to send out emails to
[01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:44.640]  people that we have email addresses for but uh the reason that that we scheduled this interview
[01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:49.520]  and discussion with you is so that you can get out to your listeners the fact that we are going
[01:15:49.520 --> 01:15:55.600]  to have a deadly serious price increase but what we're what we've done is we've put in enough stock
[01:15:55.600 --> 01:16:04.640]  so that we should be able to supply quite a few folks uh with this this product at buy three get
[01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:12.560]  one free on the selected items so get to the website uh efoodsdirect.com and uh you'll see
[01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:22.240]  a little notice up there and also if if you uh work with uh alex's show get on efoodsdirect.com
[01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:29.200]  slash alex and either way it'll get you to this landing page that'll tell you exactly what's going
[01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:36.800]  on so alex this is just absolutely absurd what's happening with the prices on food right now
[01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:42.240]  and you're right they're staging this whole thing the egg prices went up 38 percent as a result of
[01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:53.280]  that mess veggie prices have gone up like like 49 percent vegetables alex 49 percent at the at the
[01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:58.320]  wholesale level and it's just absolutely insane well i mean there's no doubt they bring in this
[01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:03.200]  draconian bill that's part of codex alimentarius and the un says they'll use food as a weapon
[01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:08.080]  and they're harassing all the little people while leaving the big corrupt ticens and others
[01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:12.160]  alone it's like they leave bp alone having more violations and all the old companies combined
[01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:18.320]  every year just in the houston refining area alone it's the same thing on this issue and my
[01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:24.880]  reason to have storable food is with the wars and the the deepening depression even if there's a 10
[01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:28.960]  percent chance this is going to happen you've got to have storable food to be self-sufficient or
[01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:34.400]  you're under government control and unfortunately i've said it's more than a 70 percent chance
[01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:39.120]  that we're going to hell in a handbasket and i've got you know stacks of news u.s new home
[01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:45.520]  cell sinks to lowest pace on uh in in history on record durable goods orders rose fire less than
[01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:53.280]  expected it continues with headlines here economy cotton depression not recession cnbc i mean we
[01:17:53.280 --> 01:17:59.440]  know this is by design i read their own documents so i say firearms food moved to the country if you
[01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:05.520]  can get out of their control grid cities warn everyone you know they mean business and you had
[01:18:05.520 --> 01:18:10.160]  90 of people being self-sufficient in the great depression over 10 years seven million starving
[01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:16.880]  to death now 90 percent are urban not rural and aren't self-sufficient it's completely flipped folks

[01:38:34.480 --> 01:38:39.040]  i tried to tell him that but him and his wife uh you know they said you know we're gonna do it
[01:38:39.040 --> 01:38:47.600]  they did it uh that very night uh she woke up with violent itching and uh had a uh a high fever

[01:39:31.200 --> 01:39:37.440]  they are and here's another surprising uh issue that happened to me uh uh yesterday i was picking
[01:39:37.440 --> 01:39:42.240]  my son up but he goes to school in pikesville maryland high school in pikesville maryland he
[01:39:42.240 --> 01:39:48.080]  plays football there picking them up after the football practice roughly around eight o'clock

[01:40:43.360 --> 01:40:48.400]  out in the day in places like arkansas and oklahoma where they search you on the streets
[01:40:48.400 --> 01:40:53.680]  during the day go ahead sorry well no no problem getting in just so i've as i'm driving through
[01:40:53.680 --> 01:40:58.400]  his neighborhood now this is a this is randall's town maryland nowhere near the city they have
[01:40:58.400 --> 01:41:06.560]  unmarked black vans and these guys jump out uh in black uniforms with shotguns literally like just

[01:41:12.240 --> 01:41:16.800]  because they're publicly getting ready to devalue the dollar and take your pension funds and social
[01:41:16.800 --> 01:41:22.080]  security and they're taking the main police forces and giving them swat training and it's pure evil
[01:41:22.960 --> 01:41:30.720]  and if you go to uh uh uh wjz it's a channel 13 news it's uh local news here uh they actually
[01:41:30.720 --> 01:41:35.280]  talk about it 11 o'clock curfew and they claim it's just to get the children off the street
[01:41:35.280 --> 01:41:42.000]  but there's as to i as to my research i found that they were actually adults women and men uh that
[01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:46.800]  were being uh uh no no no listen they're going to have checkpoints on all the streets with naked
[01:41:46.800 --> 01:41:51.280]  body scanners bathing you every week at least in radiation they're going to pull up through every

[01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:27.200]  heard you talk many times on the show about uh mentioned something about at dun kirk when
[01:43:27.200 --> 01:43:38.480]  the that the evacuation of dun kirk and then uh later albert rudolf yes yes and then hitler
[01:43:38.480 --> 01:43:44.480]  decided to attack uh russia and i've heard you say that there was come that there was a secret deal
[01:43:44.480 --> 01:43:49.680]  and marble rosa or something yeah i know that's even come out in the british newspapers in the
[01:43:49.680 --> 01:43:56.640]  last few years uh but uh i've read so many books about world war two no exaggeration probably more
[01:43:56.640 --> 01:44:03.280]  than a hundred i i was kind of on that kick when i was 12 13 14 15 and since then i probably read
[01:44:03.280 --> 01:44:09.840]  10 or 15 books but it's well over 100 total uh so it all becomes foggy which books and where but
[01:44:09.840 --> 01:44:17.040]  i've seen news articles that guy search engine hitler secret treaty uh with england and rudolf
[01:44:17.040 --> 01:44:24.160]  has had the treaty uh the the the deputy furor and remember he he was a pilot he flew in to england
[01:44:24.160 --> 01:44:29.280]  right at the start of the blitz he parachuted in and they locked him up in the tower for the rest
[01:44:29.280 --> 01:44:34.880]  of his life uh with the treaty and they had a deal of course the king of england ebb or the
[01:44:34.880 --> 01:44:39.600]  eighth was a nazi there's photos of him hiling hitler once the war started he had to run to spain
[01:44:39.600 --> 01:44:45.680]  to get out and they'd made a deal he was german himself uh and they and lord millner group others
[01:44:45.680 --> 01:44:52.480]  that will set up a dictator this was decades before then we'll have a war with them and hitler allowed
[01:44:52.480 --> 01:44:57.200]  most of them and said we won't let the military kill them all we'll do some target practice on
[01:44:57.200 --> 01:45:03.440]  some of the ships with the lou faffa headed up by herman gearing uh a world war one ace himself
[01:45:03.440 --> 01:45:10.080]  had the lou faffa uh and they let most of them escape at duncork from france to england and then
[01:45:10.080 --> 01:45:15.280]  hitler wouldn't target the major british cities he would only target military bases so the british
[01:45:15.280 --> 01:45:21.280]  launched a giant land caster attack to bomb berlin to psychologically manipulate hitler to retaliate
[01:45:21.280 --> 01:45:26.320]  to bomb london and other british cities to get british resolved behind the war and i've even
[01:45:26.320 --> 01:45:32.080]  seen that on the history channel uh but yes that's all there uh i thought maybe it had
[01:45:32.080 --> 01:45:36.560]  something to do with i thought maybe it's had something to do with his decision to turn around
[01:45:36.560 --> 01:45:42.880]  and attack uh stalin you know russia and that that i thought he meant maybe rush that england
[01:45:42.880 --> 01:45:47.920]  had manipulated him and said well why don't you attack russia and then we'll make peace with you
[01:45:47.920 --> 01:45:54.480]  later or something you know no there were overtures and that's why hindrick himmler and others
[01:45:54.480 --> 01:45:59.120]  turned themselves into the allies and then were murdered committed suicide you know they would show
[01:45:59.120 --> 01:46:04.560]  up and then that's why the british just like the globalist setup sedan hussein so he was easy to
[01:46:04.560 --> 01:46:09.680]  defeat because most of top generals were double agents it was the same thing with the germans
[01:46:09.680 --> 01:46:15.200]  they were british intelligence and so hitler never had a chance it was it was all a massive setup
[01:46:15.200 --> 01:46:21.280]  and that's in all the major mainline history if you really mind down deep no but then hitler figured
[01:46:21.280 --> 01:46:26.400]  out he'd been double crossed and there was a deal with stalin to take over germany and divide up
[01:46:26.400 --> 01:46:33.280]  europe and so he turned saying if i can if i can rush in with barba rosa operation barba rosa and
[01:46:33.280 --> 01:46:41.200]  take over with a blitzkrieg russia then i can bolster and use uh what he called arian conscripts
[01:46:41.200 --> 01:46:46.640]  from the russian frontier uh with genetic test that they would use and i did get tens of thousands
[01:46:46.640 --> 01:46:53.200]  of those but not enough then we'll be able to defeat england or sue for peace yeah uh he had
[01:46:53.200 --> 01:46:58.960]  been planning barba rosa and planned to attack russia for quite a long time and then just finally
[01:46:58.960 --> 01:47:04.400]  did it um i don't know what it did seem like there's a lot of things and i that they didn't
[01:47:04.400 --> 01:47:09.440]  explain or there was so many things that seemed like they were an accident or oh that was just
[01:47:09.440 --> 01:47:14.400]  no sure books good for an overview if you want to hear about the secret societies and all the
[01:47:14.400 --> 01:47:20.480]  intrigue and how they set up the ss along jesuit lines it's order of the death's head by hinds hobel
[01:47:21.600 --> 01:47:27.120]  but but they all have disinformation you've got to read hundreds of books and then study original
[01:47:27.120 --> 01:47:33.040]  history and declassify documents to get a full spectrum breakdown what did you think about how
[01:47:33.040 --> 01:47:41.440]  hitler used hitler used to talk all the time about or a lot about international financiers and you
[01:47:41.440 --> 01:47:49.200]  know he usually said jewish international jewish financiers manipulating the countries into war
[01:47:49.200 --> 01:47:54.720]  and stuff that's what he would talk he talked about them and the jewish financiers around
[01:47:54.720 --> 01:48:00.240]  grouped around roosevelt that wanted to get him into war and stuff why do you think he talked about
[01:48:00.240 --> 01:48:06.880]  that was he like uh being disingenuous or was he a duke that didn't realize well no i mean i mean
[01:48:06.880 --> 01:48:12.480]  i mean what of course there was the roth child's and and and the roth child's it's been in anthony
[01:48:12.480 --> 01:48:19.360]  sutton's books off of congressional senate hearings uh that that they would always fund both sides
[01:48:19.360 --> 01:48:25.440]  and so you know the there were those financiers involved in the larger system i mean in world
[01:48:25.440 --> 01:48:30.160]  war one was financed by different financiers including the roth child's that's how that's what
[01:48:30.160 --> 01:48:38.320]  globalism is is these corporations play groups uh off against uh each other uh but but hitler had
[01:48:38.320 --> 01:48:45.520]  a brand of eugenics that was going to focus in on mainly the jews and and and others uh slavs
[01:48:45.520 --> 01:48:50.960]  because they wanted to kill most the slavs for uh was it laban straw or if that's the proper
[01:48:50.960 --> 01:48:56.560]  pronunciation living space and so it was it was it was really just a racial way to get people hyped
[01:48:56.560 --> 01:49:02.400]  up but i mean always you know that you know there's some sliver of reality within that but hitler
[01:49:02.400 --> 01:49:09.920]  also thought that england was more arian than germany uh because england hadn't been uh overrun
[01:49:10.560 --> 01:49:15.520]  by uh you know some of the eastern european grips and also the arab's and so that's why he didn't
[01:49:15.520 --> 01:49:21.040]  want to bomb england or bomb the cities because of the precious arian blood i mean it it's all
[01:49:21.040 --> 01:49:24.720]  really a bunch of convoluted stuff but you can read about that in my struggle mine comp of course
[01:49:24.720 --> 01:49:28.960]  i read that remember i was about 13 at the bookstore my mom dropped me off at the mall
[01:49:28.960 --> 01:49:33.760]  and i walked over and bought mine comp and i went up to buy it and the black lady behind the counter
[01:49:33.760 --> 01:49:39.120]  freaked out and and was like thinking i was a nazi and i said lady you're selling this book
[01:49:39.120 --> 01:49:46.400]  just because i'm reading something doesn't mean i'm that i mean at 13 years old i knew that uh
[01:49:46.400 --> 01:49:54.320]  and it was you know it's just insane but again they go in and pick nationalistic grips
[01:49:56.560 --> 01:50:02.480]  it's high powered psychological warfare they build it up they financed hitler's ideology
[01:50:02.480 --> 01:50:08.800]  he was given rockefeller awards he was given all this funding and then told he was a big hero
[01:50:08.800 --> 01:50:15.840]  up until about 37 38 he was a rock star in the us time magazine man of the year he was in gardening
[01:50:15.840 --> 01:50:25.760]  magazines he was all over radio he was being praised and so he was encouraged by ibm and encouraged
[01:50:26.640 --> 01:50:34.800]  by a lot of these big powerful groups to do what he did so there were other other factions and there
[01:50:34.800 --> 01:50:41.520]  was a pro hitler faction with the bushes and this came out the mccormick dickstein committee
[01:50:41.520 --> 01:50:46.880]  and spandley butler exposed it they tried to hire him than the marine corps general to stage a coup
[01:50:46.880 --> 01:50:54.400]  against roosevelt saying he was a jewish communist but then but then it all flip flopped back and
[01:50:54.400 --> 01:51:00.800]  turned out it was a giant intelligence setup to manipulate hitler and then it's very sophisticated
[01:51:00.800 --> 01:51:05.840]  hi this is alex jones did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret

[01:54:06.880 --> 01:54:14.160]  we're back live continuing with your phone call since the caller mentioned hitler i want to tell
[01:54:14.160 --> 01:54:20.320]  you next hour hitler had jewish and african roots dna test of 39 living relatives show
[01:54:20.320 --> 01:54:29.600]  conclusively well anybody in europe all the dna studies have shown the original mitochondrial
[01:54:29.600 --> 01:54:39.680]  dna is african i mean mitochondrial dna it never changes and is basically the original core
[01:54:40.960 --> 01:54:44.720]  doesn't change according to what i've seen the geneticist report on and it's passed on
[01:54:45.360 --> 01:54:52.560]  and by the mother there's two kinds of dna and so but but but they're testing the non mitochondrial
[01:54:52.560 --> 01:54:58.160]  and finding it as well i mean europe has been overrun over and over again they've studied
[01:54:58.160 --> 01:55:03.200]  people in india they're full of nordic blood they've studied people in china they've dug up
[01:55:03.200 --> 01:55:09.280]  thousands of graves with people that still have hair i've seen it nationally graphic blonde hair
[01:55:09.280 --> 01:55:15.600]  six foot tall i mean humans have been traveling everywhere what do you think hispanics are
[01:55:17.120 --> 01:55:21.680]  they're european whenever they have these illegal alien rallies they're saying go home to europe
[01:55:21.680 --> 01:55:32.480]  pilgrim go home to europe you're european and asian the genetics of the pure tribal indians of
[01:55:32.480 --> 01:55:38.160]  central south america who haven't intermarried with spanish and portuguese folks that moved in
[01:55:38.160 --> 01:55:42.880]  and and and other ethnic groups certain extent austrian german there's a lot of that french
[01:55:42.880 --> 01:55:48.160]  in the caribbean central south america i said i'd cover it next hour i'm already covering it here
[01:55:48.160 --> 01:55:59.360]  they are asian they are basically closely akin to chinese and japanese uh if you study
[01:55:59.360 --> 01:56:06.640]  their genetics going back to groups that were in northern east asia because where's japan
[01:56:06.640 --> 01:56:14.160]  japan is right up by russia uh in the pacific ocean the north pacific and it's just miles
[01:56:14.160 --> 01:56:19.040]  away from russia what color do you think the people are that live in far eastern russia
[01:56:19.040 --> 01:56:26.640]  they're asians they look chinese well those are the people that migrated 30 000 plus years ago
[01:56:26.640 --> 01:56:32.480]  the dna shows in to the americas and now i saw this on the news i'd already seen previous reports
[01:56:32.480 --> 01:56:39.040]  where they've dug up north all over north america they've done all this dna testing on pure uh indian
[01:56:39.040 --> 01:56:43.280]  tribes native americans they've even dug up graves of people that were known to be a hundred percent
[01:56:43.280 --> 01:56:50.240]  pure and it's a hundred percent because they can go back they can go back and tell how far back in
[01:56:50.240 --> 01:57:01.120]  the dna it goes and it goes back 5000 years or more to nordic people so no one is pure chinese or
[01:57:01.120 --> 01:57:08.400]  pure german or pure jewish or pure brit i mean britain was constantly invaded over and over again
[01:57:08.400 --> 01:57:16.560]  by different tribes the brits themselves uh were germanic and vizagoth groups that invaded and took
[01:57:16.560 --> 01:57:24.480]  over northern england and then you had the celtic people celtic celtic whatever you want to call it
[01:57:25.280 --> 01:57:29.520]  tomato tomato that moved up into the north and were driven out into other areas and you had
[01:57:29.520 --> 01:57:39.200]  vikings always invading so of course hitler has semitic blood of course he had african blood i mean
[01:57:39.200 --> 01:57:45.040]  it's it's it's it's crazy all these people that's i mean you know that i've seen black groups that
[01:57:45.040 --> 01:57:49.520]  say if you have one drop of white blood you're a devil and i see groups say if you have one drop of
[01:57:49.520 --> 01:57:54.480]  you know if you're an arian and you have one drop of somebody else's blood uh you know that you're a
[01:57:54.480 --> 01:57:59.760]  devil and it's the devil's seed well then you're all going to hell folks because we all come from
[01:57:59.760 --> 01:58:06.480]  the same mitochondrial dna continuing hitler had jewish and african roots london telegraph
[01:58:06.480 --> 01:58:11.440]  adolf hitler is likely to have had jewish and african roots dna test have shown saliva samples
[01:58:11.440 --> 01:58:17.040]  taken from 39 relatives of the nazi leader show he may have biological links to subhuman races
[01:58:17.040 --> 01:58:22.160]  that's in quotes that he tried to exterminate during the holocaust john paul molders a belgian
[01:58:22.160 --> 01:58:27.920]  journalist and mark vermin a historian tracked down the furor's relatives including an austrian
[01:58:27.920 --> 01:58:33.200]  farmer who was his cousin earlier this year it all shows the same thing the chromosome called

[02:00:43.040 --> 02:00:48.320]  news it gets more murderous by the minute major cutbacks to police forces all over the country
[02:00:48.320 --> 02:00:53.680]  we've been talking about that the last year here it is in us today the pentagon is openly
[02:00:53.680 --> 02:00:59.600]  taking over our towns and cities covertly it's so illegal it's why we have positive commentatus
[02:00:59.600 --> 02:01:04.080]  look at the third world the military is always taken over and that doesn't mean the average
[02:01:04.080 --> 02:01:09.440]  military man or woman the people running the system are crooks just like the germans weren't bad
[02:01:09.440 --> 02:01:14.640]  people but hitler was bad their commanders the russians weren't bad people linen and stalling were
[02:01:14.640 --> 02:01:20.880]  bad henry you know the eighth was a bad guy but the brits weren't bad people i mean it's so
[02:01:20.880 --> 02:01:26.080]  elementary let's go to jake and pa the nathan tony michael joe and others jake you're on the air
[02:01:27.120 --> 02:01:34.160]  hey what's up worldwide transmission all right well uh basically i wanted to make a point about
[02:01:34.880 --> 02:01:40.560]  the mosque at ground zero i do believe people are misinterpreting what's going on there
[02:01:41.280 --> 02:01:45.600]  you want to hear my uh take on it well i have the absolute take by the way that you guys print
[02:01:45.600 --> 02:01:52.400]  that link uh that i was telling you about uh from the uh from the mosques website itself where they
[02:01:53.280 --> 02:01:57.280]  where they said their number one funder is actually not the fox news owner
[02:01:57.280 --> 02:02:02.160]  he's a big one uh but that it's the rockefeller foundation so we 100 now know what this is and
[02:02:02.160 --> 02:02:07.600]  that's a big story i meant to get to it go ahead well that's a part of it like the people funding
[02:02:07.600 --> 02:02:13.120]  it is a part of the situation but actually i do believe they're setting that up because they're
[02:02:13.120 --> 02:02:19.520]  engineering an assassination attempt on obama so that you know they can implement their
[02:02:19.520 --> 02:02:24.480]  marshal i agree i said nine months ago i said nine months ago i concur with you
[02:02:24.480 --> 02:02:28.320]  that obama is one of the false flag cards they've gotten their hip pocket go ahead
[02:02:29.360 --> 02:02:32.880]  exactly and i believe that's why you're having all this
[02:02:33.440 --> 02:02:40.320]  muslim anti muslim fervor and conflict and tension rising you know you have fox coming
[02:02:40.320 --> 02:02:47.760]  out with the poll that 20 of people think oh you know u.s citizens think obama's a muslim
[02:02:47.760 --> 02:02:54.160]  he was born in a muslim country they're basically painting him as you know your poster boy muslim
[02:02:54.160 --> 02:03:03.280]  so that when they have a cia front militia group uh you know try to assassinate them bingo you know
[02:03:03.280 --> 02:03:08.880]  they could yeah they could pin it on a militia group and then you know they could implement their
[02:03:08.880 --> 02:03:14.320]  marshal law try to confiscate guns and whatnot and i'm gonna hold you over and give you the floor
[02:03:14.320 --> 02:03:18.320]  i'm gonna put you on hold because i want to cover this now and i want people to get this video out
[02:03:18.320 --> 02:03:22.720]  to everyone off of prison planet dot tv of the radio simulcast i want you to recap everything
[02:03:22.720 --> 02:03:26.800]  you're saying when we come back but i don't want to cut you short now we'll put it back on screen
[02:03:26.800 --> 02:03:35.840]  there is the imams international philanthropic organization number one funder carnegie corporation
[02:03:35.840 --> 02:03:41.600]  of new york number two rockefeller brothers number three rockefeller philanthropy uh number four
[02:03:41.600 --> 02:03:47.440]  rockefeller brothers fund now i went and looked at that last night and added up the amounts they
[02:03:47.440 --> 02:03:52.320]  say they've given so when i see rockefeller's number one if you add the three together it's bigger
[02:03:52.320 --> 02:03:57.840]  than the carnegie corporation for new york and in the 40s and 70s they had congressional hearings
[02:03:57.840 --> 02:04:03.360]  that we've read the quotes from here of the tax free foundations just search the term congressional
[02:04:03.360 --> 02:04:07.520]  and senate investigations of tax free foundations they got their minutes they said we're going to
[02:04:07.520 --> 02:04:11.760]  set up a world government we're going to finance world war one and world war two we're going to
[02:04:11.760 --> 02:04:15.920]  buy off the churches with the world council of churches we're going to buy off the muslims
[02:04:15.920 --> 02:04:21.200]  we're going to buy off the hinders and we're going to secretly finance them murdering each other
[02:04:21.200 --> 02:04:28.480]  and then we'll be the arbiter we'll be the referee of all of this posing as the people that are
[02:04:28.480 --> 02:04:34.720]  liberal and want peace and the carnegie endowment said contrary to stopping war our endowment for
[02:04:34.720 --> 02:04:40.640]  peace we will we will be the progenitors of war because war is the health of the state this is
[02:04:40.640 --> 02:04:47.280]  our full spectrum dominance control system by playing all sides and so yes and this imam may

[02:08:35.760 --> 02:08:41.680]  with jake and pa if you just joined us there's so much happening in this full spectrum dominance

[02:09:04.560 --> 02:09:09.920]  at prison planet dot tv in full living color so you can see what we're reading see the videos
[02:09:09.920 --> 02:09:16.320]  we're talking about you can experience it and live this ongoing education and awakening that i'm
[02:09:16.320 --> 02:09:21.760]  going through that my crew is going through that you're going through it's an a group experience
[02:09:21.760 --> 02:09:29.920]  and a symbiotic and is multifaceted multivariate and is interactive with us together now he brought
[02:09:29.920 --> 02:09:34.960]  up something that i noticed going back two years ago before he even got elected right right before
[02:09:34.960 --> 02:09:39.360]  he got elected going into the election it's almost two years in november in a couple months
[02:09:40.560 --> 02:09:45.920]  that they were building him up as a messianic god who would save everyone and end racism but i knew
[02:09:45.920 --> 02:09:52.240]  the big tax-free foundations fund racism and social division tribalism is what the sociologist and
[02:09:52.240 --> 02:09:58.000]  anthropologist actually call it the psych warfare chiefs and that he would not deliver he had the
[02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:03.200]  very same advisors that he would actually accelerate the tyranny every president it gets worse since
[02:10:03.200 --> 02:10:07.840]  kennedy since the full spectrum coup happened they were already in control but they really took control
[02:10:07.840 --> 02:10:13.920]  then they had their beachhead 1913 fellow reserve act and that they would build him up then destroy
[02:10:13.920 --> 02:10:21.840]  him politically anytime you criticize government-run health care wars torture secret police anything
[02:10:21.840 --> 02:10:27.680]  they're doing you're a racist they would invoke that anytime you disagree with any of his policies
[02:10:27.680 --> 02:10:33.280]  and he's just a front man on harvard teleprompter reading lawyer though you know smarter than bush
[02:10:33.280 --> 02:10:40.320]  the last puppet and that they were building up to reinvoke oklahoma city and the patriot movement
[02:10:40.320 --> 02:10:46.400]  and staged terror attacks to be blamed on us including in that spectrum and claiming we're
[02:10:46.400 --> 02:10:52.400]  all white al-qaeda and saying if you don't like corrupt government you're you uh i saw a uh seeing
[02:10:52.400 --> 02:10:57.440]  in peace with potok and he was saying a lot of black groups are becoming sovereign citizens
[02:10:57.440 --> 02:11:01.920]  and refusing to go through the system little do they know they're following a white supremacist
[02:11:01.920 --> 02:11:06.880]  ideology well what does that have to do with it this is oh my gosh black people are getting into
[02:11:06.880 --> 02:11:11.200]  this and of course there's a spectrum of sovereign citizen groups there's people that are hardcore
[02:11:11.200 --> 02:11:17.440]  accurate and then kooks out there that are filing fake papers but but on this piece they go this one
[02:11:17.440 --> 02:11:24.720]  family fired filed paperwork and stole a house and then it went on to say their house always here
[02:11:24.720 --> 02:11:30.960]  a woman has kidnapped a child amber alerts and it says cps ordered the woman to turn her child in
[02:11:30.960 --> 02:11:41.040]  and she's disappeared so they are always invoking this and and yes uh obama better know that either
[02:11:41.040 --> 02:11:46.320]  an attempted assassination they've already primed the pump with some of these or a real op where
[02:11:46.320 --> 02:11:52.640]  they kill him dead in a hammer and it is going to be hellish and it will cause race riots no doubt
[02:11:52.640 --> 02:11:57.280]  it will cause total false flag demonization of anybody that criticizes government and they'll
[02:11:57.280 --> 02:12:04.000]  use him as the sacrificial lamb to ram through their entire agenda so pray for obama's safety
[02:12:05.520 --> 02:12:11.440]  pray for his safety every day because you've already seen well they said on the scene in
[02:12:11.440 --> 02:12:16.800]  peace yeah these people are cop killers too and then gave no evidence yeah that alex jones he
[02:12:16.800 --> 02:12:25.200]  supports cop killing mm-hmm saying the opposite that they just they've got that they want to
[02:12:25.200 --> 02:12:33.280]  sick the government and the enforcers on us and so jake finish your point okay well basically
[02:12:34.160 --> 02:12:39.520]  i don't believe obama is a muslim i don't believe that he believes in god i think he's one of these
[02:12:39.520 --> 02:12:45.440]  illuminati you know shape-shifting devil worshiping sellouts i mean he's a puppet and i believe
[02:12:45.440 --> 02:12:50.800]  that's what he is but nonetheless he's a nihilistic front man who loves to party and use drugs he
[02:12:50.800 --> 02:12:57.360]  admits it and is bisexual and reads off teleprompters i mean that they're just worldly scum when you
[02:12:57.360 --> 02:13:05.040]  look at actual globalists at the top they are very pious and cult-like and focused and all of them
[02:13:05.040 --> 02:13:10.880]  give money to luciferian groups and they hate humanity and want to kill people uh and and
[02:13:10.880 --> 02:13:18.880]  obama doesn't have those characteristics he's a literal front man the well basically my point is
[02:13:18.880 --> 02:13:25.200]  they're starting to really focus on you know people's opinion of him being a muslim and with
[02:13:25.200 --> 02:13:30.320]  all this tension that they've raised between the muslim and non-muslim communities they're setting
[02:13:30.320 --> 02:13:37.120]  up the perfect scenario to pull this type of staged event and you know blame it on a militia
[02:13:37.120 --> 02:13:44.400]  group that's nothing but a cia front you know let's be clear if you're a poker game with a
[02:13:44.400 --> 02:13:50.800]  card shark and he's got 10 cards in there ace of spades you name it it doesn't mean he's going
[02:13:50.800 --> 02:13:57.200]  to play the queen of diamonds you know this manchurian candidate it doesn't mean that or the queen
[02:13:57.200 --> 02:14:02.720]  of hearts it doesn't mean that just because it's in the sleeve just remember it's in the arsenal
[02:14:02.720 --> 02:14:08.080]  and it does clearly look like they are preparing that and are looking at green lighting it go ahead
[02:14:08.080 --> 02:14:15.840]  well that's basically my point with that and then you know if they did actually go through with it
[02:14:15.840 --> 02:14:20.560]  you know that would be the perfect excuse to have their martial law and confiscate guns and whatnot
[02:14:21.360 --> 02:14:27.600]  now the second point that i did want to make another thing that i kind of see that the globalist
[02:14:27.600 --> 02:14:34.240]  did and actually uh jessie ventura did a conspiracy show on this on the harp weather
[02:14:34.240 --> 02:14:40.000]  uh radio transmitter and basically with pakistan now you had that general on a couple weeks ago
[02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:45.600]  and he explained how you know the intel that you know many people are reporting was in the wiki
[02:14:45.600 --> 02:14:52.320]  leaks uh exposure you know was basically exposing the fact that our government has
[02:14:52.320 --> 02:14:58.720]  been working inside pakistan to you know destabilize the country and you burn russia you flood
[02:14:58.720 --> 02:15:05.520]  pakistan they can do it with the jet streams over the pole the 1997 army briefing with the
[02:15:05.520 --> 02:15:13.520]  secretary of defense william cohen uh april 28th uh 1997 he said we have weather weapons and tectonic
[02:15:13.520 --> 02:15:17.760]  weapons they have heart facilities everywhere i have the director of harp on he admitted they
[02:15:17.760 --> 02:15:24.160]  can even ignite the atmosphere and yes they can also use weather weapons to terrify people to accept
[02:15:24.160 --> 02:15:32.480]  carbon taxes go ahead correct well i do feel that you know it is kind of too much of a coincidence
[02:15:32.480 --> 02:15:38.080]  that right after the wiki leaks exposure exposure you do have the massive flooding in pakistan
[02:15:38.080 --> 02:15:43.920]  and why would they do that why would they do that well to bankrupt them further to be under the
[02:15:43.920 --> 02:15:51.280]  control of the imf and world bank exactly and not only that but it furthers the if furthers help
[02:15:51.280 --> 02:15:57.840]  in destabilizing the country which makes it easier for them to try to overtake and take control of
[02:15:57.840 --> 02:16:04.720]  because obviously they know by the way that they don't need harp to cause flooding with i've had the
[02:16:04.720 --> 02:16:10.400]  father of weather weapons on declassified ben livingston with eight modern aircraft he can make
[02:16:10.960 --> 02:16:16.800]  you know during the hurricane season a mega hurricane or kill it or weaken it with aircraft
[02:16:16.800 --> 02:16:21.920]  they can go in during the monsoon and hit them and hit them hard they can do it outside their
[02:16:21.920 --> 02:16:26.640]  airspace but we have aircraft all over their airspace so they don't need to use their high
[02:16:26.640 --> 02:16:33.760]  tech weapons they've got low tech cloud seating well that may be true well i'm in either way i do
[02:16:33.760 --> 02:16:39.520]  feel you know these floods are being man manipulated i don't believe it's just a natural course of
[02:16:39.520 --> 02:16:45.600]  reality um in my experience with these new world order people because i have had direct experience
[02:16:45.600 --> 02:16:52.080]  with it and i do know exactly what they're trying to do i realized there's no such thing as coincidences
[02:16:52.080 --> 02:16:57.280]  and i definitely think because their covert operations were exposed well now they got to
[02:16:57.280 --> 02:17:01.600]  hit them with an environmental operation i hear you i gotta jump though i need to get to other
[02:17:01.600 --> 02:17:07.200]  callers good points i understand their full spectrum dominance so well from years of deep
[02:17:07.200 --> 02:17:15.120]  research that i can lay their in bed at about midnight think of something horrible because i
[02:17:15.120 --> 02:17:19.520]  know their mind like hameed ghoul said i read their mind because i literally that's what a good
[02:17:19.520 --> 02:17:24.320]  general does is you put yourself in their place you think like them i could think of something
[02:17:24.320 --> 02:17:30.560]  horrible go in and search it and find mainstream news and it's almost always brand new it's almost
[02:17:30.560 --> 02:17:37.680]  like because it's gone into the ether because it's now being done it's like four or five guys
[02:17:37.680 --> 02:17:41.040]  invented radio the same week and rolled it out in different parts of the world
[02:17:41.040 --> 02:17:47.360]  you're up the united states other areas because it's just that level of understanding
[02:17:48.880 --> 02:17:53.200]  and it's the same thing the most horrible things you can imagine they're doing it
[02:17:53.200 --> 02:17:57.760]  if you can think of it they're doing it and if they've got a weapon system they're going to use it
[02:17:58.720 --> 02:18:03.280]  these people are brazen they're bold they're aggressive they're hyper dominant the most
[02:18:03.280 --> 02:18:09.120]  hyper dominant thing you can do is kill your enemies wipe them out exterminate let's go to
[02:18:09.120 --> 02:18:14.880]  nathan in oklahoma thanks for holding thanks alex for taking me um i have a couple i'll get right
[02:18:14.880 --> 02:18:20.080]  to the point um i have a couple things the first thing i'll tell you about the history of my town
[02:18:20.080 --> 02:18:27.600]  i live in katoos oklahoma and uh within the past couple months uh we have had a couple of police
[02:18:27.600 --> 02:18:35.840]  officers get caught for pushing drugs through the town and also uh the county clerk or city hall clerk
[02:18:35.840 --> 02:18:42.000]  that you know deals with the tickets and is that the feds that caught them because when they do that
[02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:47.200]  they'll send good feds in to bust them and then bring bad feds in later to consolidate and make
[02:18:47.200 --> 02:18:56.480]  sure all the money goes to them right and um so that happened and uh so in the case of paper on
[02:18:56.480 --> 02:19:03.280]  wednesday august 11 2010 uh we have a new police chief that is going to be in office on the 28th
[02:19:03.280 --> 02:19:11.840]  and uh our mayor of course appoints the chief and in the paper our mayor also uh tells the
[02:19:12.720 --> 02:19:20.080]  paper pretty much what they're going to say and uh so in the paper uh mayor rito lamkin she said
[02:19:20.080 --> 02:19:25.920]  about this new police chief he is very qualified um and then in the paper he says our nature comes
[02:19:25.920 --> 02:19:32.160]  to the position from the cheque nation enterprises where he has worked 10 years with security
[02:19:32.160 --> 02:19:38.560]  internal investigation and audits and the mayor here has the training and ability to spot illegal
[02:19:38.560 --> 02:19:44.960]  activity because he's been watching alfred on a day-to-day basis at the casino and uh previously
[02:19:44.960 --> 02:19:49.600]  she had not wanted nothing to do with the casino yeah so now you're going to have casino security
[02:19:49.600 --> 02:19:55.360]  heads as your police chief the casino gulag economy is that what you're saying yes well the

[02:24:31.440 --> 02:24:37.440]  asking where you're going it's all about training you and more and more they're hiring private
[02:24:37.440 --> 02:24:43.520]  security people to be police chiefs i've seen this trend and so basically they're going to run
[02:24:43.520 --> 02:24:51.200]  society like max keiser has said like a casino so you're seeing in your town you're going to have
[02:24:51.200 --> 02:24:58.000]  now basically a security pit boss as your police chief keeping you in line and making sure that the
[02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:04.960]  house the government the parasite system gets all that juicy blood right well uh like i was
[02:25:04.960 --> 02:25:09.600]  reading in the paper though it said the key word would be where he works 10 years with
[02:25:09.600 --> 02:25:15.040]  security now anyone in the casino can work with security what he actually did in the casino
[02:25:15.040 --> 02:25:19.760]  was where you had to go through security to get to the lost and found which is what he where he
[02:25:19.760 --> 02:25:26.080]  was working apparently and so now uh he tells the paper though that's new chief he says i have
[02:25:26.080 --> 02:25:31.600]  training in homicide and major crimes investigations terrorism and street gangs through the council
[02:25:31.600 --> 02:25:38.400]  on law enforcement education and training and also received extensive training through the
[02:25:38.400 --> 02:25:44.320]  federal emergency management agency yeah the feds are putting anybody in that's a fema minion
[02:25:44.320 --> 02:25:50.560]  and most of these new police chiefs are sent by this federal council where they promise more federal
[02:25:50.560 --> 02:25:58.080]  funds if they appoint who they want almost every police chief is either not from the area
[02:25:58.080 --> 02:26:05.440]  federally funded or even better they're foreigners they're not even born here and and and so they're
[02:26:05.440 --> 02:26:11.200]  putting their personnel in place a few months ago i had that british member of parliament on
[02:26:11.200 --> 02:26:20.160]  one and he said that most of the cps heads and cps agents are now former eastern block
[02:26:20.160 --> 02:26:24.400]  they grew up having government take kids they don't even hardly speak english they just want
[02:26:24.400 --> 02:26:28.880]  the money and they get bonuses for more kids so they just come take your kids it's foreigners

[02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:57.360]  admittedly of the force compulsory service they now have in legislation uh to have giant youth
[02:35:57.360 --> 02:36:02.480]  cores also part of cyber security so it's the government bankrupting everything and then forcing
[02:36:02.480 --> 02:36:08.720]  most of the youth into government controlled jobs right and i have been online and i've looked at this
[02:36:08.720 --> 02:36:15.280]  in my state and listed under uh south carolina in americorps we already have a 10 month full-time
[02:36:15.280 --> 02:36:21.040]  residential program for men and women between the ages of 18 and 24 in exchange for their services
[02:36:21.040 --> 02:36:25.440]  americorps members earn an education award that can be used to pay for college or to pay back
[02:36:25.440 --> 02:36:31.440]  qualified student loans and they've got a subdivision called secure core which going back even 11 years
[02:36:31.440 --> 02:36:40.880]  ago trains them to take on the american people as spies it's a cia recruiting front i went in
[02:36:40.880 --> 02:36:48.400]  to sign up for this it asked me for my social security number my age and whether or not i was
[02:36:48.400 --> 02:36:57.920]  a veteran i am a veteran and uh i also fell for this entire 9 11 thing the h1 in onescare i just
[02:36:57.920 --> 02:37:04.080]  woke up within the last couple of months and i am so p o'd i joined the regulators i joined the
[02:37:04.080 --> 02:37:09.680]  tea party movement i've joined the patriotic resistance i've been spending my full time on
[02:37:09.680 --> 02:37:16.560]  this because i had them shoot up my daughter with poison and when that happened this was personal
[02:37:16.560 --> 02:37:21.920]  this became personal for me and now i'm checking into this what do you think about now i've been
[02:37:21.920 --> 02:37:27.040]  Michelle that's that's that's the way when they want to microwave you at the checkpoints and the
[02:37:27.040 --> 02:37:31.840]  naked body scanners when they want to put deadly poison in your daughter they are assaulting you
[02:37:31.840 --> 02:37:38.000]  and you're having a normal response you're angry you're focused and nothing can stop an angry mama
[02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:42.480]  and i'm telling you all of us are in this fight together but what was your final question
[02:37:42.480 --> 02:37:47.840]  um my final question is um first of all i think they're going to put rick perry in there
[02:37:48.720 --> 02:37:52.800]  he's a builder burger and now they've got him fighting obama in the news as far as the mexicans
[02:37:52.800 --> 02:38:00.880]  go but anyway um with uh ufo's i've been going on looking at ufo's since about uh july of this
[02:38:00.880 --> 02:38:05.280]  year just really looking at him and they've got the most spectacular pictures we've ever seen in
[02:38:05.280 --> 02:38:12.320]  the past 60 years i really think that perhaps i don't know in 2012 when the zion olympics occurred
[02:38:12.320 --> 02:38:16.560]  in london we might have a big ufo thing but i just want everybody to be really aware that
[02:38:16.560 --> 02:38:22.240]  that technology that they've been keeping hidden from us at area 51 for the past 60 years is going
[02:38:22.240 --> 02:38:27.120]  to be coming in to use for this false black technology i hear you michelle i gotta jump
[02:38:27.120 --> 02:38:33.520]  but that's actually declassified project bluebeam fake alien invasions and now mainstream news says
[02:38:33.520 --> 02:38:39.360]  church hill says they're real the aliens are coming and it's it's i believe it's a fraud uh
[02:38:39.360 --> 02:38:45.840]  uh i'm going to get to joe ronnie andrew delta i'll try to get to all of you before the show ends
[02:38:45.840 --> 02:38:53.280]  but i've got a bunch of news i've got a hit on now and the first thing is the financial news okay
[02:38:57.600 --> 02:39:03.280]  let me go ahead and get into this news here morgan stanley says government defaults inevitable
[02:39:04.160 --> 02:39:08.960]  investors will face defaults on government bonds given the burden of aging populations the difficulty
[02:39:08.960 --> 02:39:13.600]  of securing more tax revenue according to morgan stanley the communist chinese government saying
[02:39:13.600 --> 02:39:23.680]  the same thing us new home sales sink to lowest pace on record new home sales lowest on record
[02:39:23.680 --> 02:39:30.320]  existing homes lowest level since 1968 durable goods orders rose far less than expected
[02:39:31.200 --> 02:39:35.920]  stock market plunge and the plunge protection team came up pumped it back up to 10 000 today
[02:39:35.920 --> 02:39:41.200]  like let's check where it is right now guys dowell faces bouncy ride to 5 000 top strategists tell c
[02:39:41.200 --> 02:39:50.000]  nbc economy caught in depression not recession c nbc now here's a key article from the economic
[02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:54.720]  collapse excellent blog you can link through to the reserve accumulation international monetary
[02:39:54.720 --> 02:40:00.800]  stability act directly on the imf zone website understand this is this is them saying it now
[02:40:00.800 --> 02:40:05.440]  we told you years ago they're going to be called s dr's they're going to be based on s dr's this
[02:40:05.440 --> 02:40:11.520]  is the global private banks issuing their own fiat peer to peer computer to computer bank to bank
[02:40:12.960 --> 02:40:20.400]  digital currency that will be backed up with your carbon taxes go read this a global tax
[02:40:20.400 --> 02:40:27.120]  to these private crooks and they don't care what you think they're doing it and the article goes on
[02:40:27.120 --> 02:40:32.240]  sometimes there are things that are so shocking that you just do not want to report them unless
[02:40:32.240 --> 02:40:36.400]  they're completely and totally documented over the past few years there have been uh many rumors
[02:40:36.400 --> 02:40:41.760]  no not rumors document in fact about a coming global currency but at times it has been difficult
[02:40:41.760 --> 02:40:45.040]  to pin down evidence that plans for such a currency are actually in the works because
[02:40:45.040 --> 02:40:48.080]  you're not going to get a physical one you're still going to have your regional currency just
[02:40:48.080 --> 02:40:54.480]  like real id acts a global id card but it's locally has its local packaging it says texas on it
[02:40:54.480 --> 02:40:59.120]  it says albuquerque new mexico you know it says new york on it they even have it down to the city
[02:40:59.120 --> 02:41:04.000]  you live in now but it's globally standardized it's like they got 12 different versions of sports
[02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:10.880]  illustrated it's still sports illustrated ladies and gentlemen okay so so they control your currency
[02:41:10.880 --> 02:41:16.880]  you have this global currency above it over the past years there have been many rumors about a
[02:41:16.880 --> 02:41:20.880]  coming global currency but at times it has been difficult to pin down evidence that plans for
[02:41:20.880 --> 02:41:25.360]  such a currency are actually in the works not anymore a paper entitled reserve accumulation
[02:41:25.360 --> 02:41:30.400]  international monetary stability by the strategy policy review department of the imf recommends
[02:41:30.400 --> 02:41:36.960]  that the world adopt a global currency called the bangkor or the bangkor b a n c o r and the
[02:41:36.960 --> 02:41:40.560]  global central bank be established to administer the currency it's already been set up they've
[02:41:40.560 --> 02:41:46.320]  been trading these for years the report is dated april 13th 2010 and a full copy can be read here
[02:41:46.320 --> 02:41:52.000]  and fortunately this is not hype and it's not rumor this is very it's a serious proposal and
[02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:55.920]  it's an official document for one of the mega powerful institutions that is actually running
[02:41:55.920 --> 02:42:03.760]  the world economy and it goes on continuing here ron paul calls for audit of us gold reserves kit
[02:42:03.760 --> 02:42:10.000]  co exclusive he's in an interview with them and said the gold is missing they won't say where it is
[02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:14.480]  he's going to call for congress to demand an audit and then watch the bankers say oh we don't want
[02:42:14.480 --> 02:42:19.040]  to look at the gold don't look at the gold that'll further expose them even though their puppet
[02:42:19.040 --> 02:42:23.760]  congress won't pass the audit if they tried to they probably did a nuke or something and say
[02:42:23.760 --> 02:42:27.680]  ron paul done it i mean you know i'm not kidding these are criminals these are hardcore crooks
[02:42:27.680 --> 02:42:33.200]  who who are relying on completing their swindle by putting in a hardcore police state to suppress
[02:42:33.200 --> 02:42:40.640]  you all right uh i want to get into jfk and a few other key tidbits but i wanted to briefly for
[02:42:40.640 --> 02:42:45.680]  about four minutes bring ten anerson up because gold rocketed 50 plus dollars the globalists
[02:42:45.680 --> 02:42:50.160]  tried to drive it down it rocketed right back up this week and i haven't even asked to have
[02:42:50.160 --> 02:42:54.080]  it i wanted to get him on and ask him on air i'm sending him a text message he said sure he'd come
[02:42:54.080 --> 02:42:58.640]  on the owner of genesis the owner of modest resources the most trusted name in precious metals
[02:43:00.080 --> 02:43:03.600]  he's got the best deals out there i don't even know if he could still offer that smoking deal he
[02:43:03.600 --> 02:43:08.880]  had last week or if he ran out but all his deals are always very very competitive and he can deliver
[02:43:08.880 --> 02:43:13.840]  it right to you most other companies aren't even 30 years in the business so they can't even hold
[02:43:13.840 --> 02:43:18.720]  on to good deals you're paying major premiums not with ted uh with these radio specials i can
[02:43:18.720 --> 02:43:22.880]  guarantee you these are smoking deals ted with all this happening in the economy give us your

[02:43:37.600 --> 02:43:42.080]  the they're just talking about the united states defaulting on the government debt and they're
[02:43:42.080 --> 02:43:48.400]  not saying it like it will could happen they're saying that the defaults are inevitable and that
[02:43:48.400 --> 02:43:51.840]  means that the interest rates here in the united states are going to go up we're going to lose our
[02:43:52.400 --> 02:43:59.360]  triple a rating in our bonds and it's just going to be incredibly crushing to the budget at the at

[02:48:08.240 --> 02:48:12.160]  agent is saying let's play part of this clip going to break and i'll come back and comment on it here
[02:48:12.160 --> 02:48:22.880]  is 63 president john f kennedy is gunned down in dallas officially lee harvey oswald fired the fatal
[02:48:22.880 --> 02:48:28.400]  shots from the texas book depository but now a local man's got history in the crosshairs
[02:48:30.480 --> 02:48:38.080]  did lee harvey oswald kill president john f kennedy no had nothing to do with it former fbi agent
[02:48:38.080 --> 02:48:44.240]  don adams from summit county says thousands of national archives prove the warring commission was
[02:48:44.240 --> 02:48:50.240]  was nothing but a bunch of liars the korean war veteran entered the fbi september 1962
[02:48:50.240 --> 02:48:55.360]  he was assigned to thomas phil georgia where he began investigating a man named joseph adams
[02:48:55.360 --> 02:49:00.560]  miltear he was reported to be one of the most violent men in the country a friend of miltears
[02:49:00.560 --> 02:49:06.960]  william somerset who was also an fbi informant said miltear was threatening jfk and somerset was
[02:49:06.960 --> 02:49:11.840]  telling them that he was really radical and he was saying bad things about what they wanted to
[02:49:11.840 --> 02:49:18.320]  kennedy agent adams completed the miltear investigation and a week later shots rang out in
[02:49:18.320 --> 02:49:29.840]  dallas it devastated me and i thought to myself what did i do wrong his boss said find miltear
[02:49:29.840 --> 02:49:35.520]  i said goodbye to my partner he never said a word to me about anything about miltear that he knew
[02:49:35.520 --> 02:49:41.040]  him or anything many years later don learned that agents contacted his partner who told them miltear
[02:49:41.040 --> 02:49:46.640]  wasn't georgia essentially eliminating him as a suspect and that shocked me when i saw that
[02:49:46.640 --> 02:49:52.560]  document because i knew it was an outright lie then when adams finally captured miltear days later
[02:49:52.560 --> 02:49:58.640]  he says his supervisor prohibited him from conducting a proper interrogation miltear was
[02:49:58.640 --> 02:50:05.840]  released and agent adams transferred and where did i go but to dallas texas he remembers seeing this
[02:50:05.840 --> 02:50:10.880]  a brooder film for the very first time and all of a sudden i saw the present go like this with his
[02:50:10.880 --> 02:50:15.920]  hands and i said how and i said he was shot and he was shot in the throat the minute that you have
[02:50:15.920 --> 02:50:22.080]  a frontal shot oswald can't be the shooter because this came from the grassy knoll and oswald was in
[02:50:22.080 --> 02:50:29.040]  texas school book depository the warrant commission said three shots were fired but don counted 11
[02:50:29.600 --> 02:50:37.040]  the agent said to me don uh be careful what you say and how you say it because the warrant
[02:50:37.040 --> 02:50:42.960]  commission is here and they've already ruled that oswald is the shooter and there were no shots
[02:50:42.960 --> 02:50:48.480]  from the front the army veteran wondered how oswald fired three shots in seven and a half

[02:54:17.920 --> 02:54:21.680]  county is making claims regarding the assassination of president john f kennedy they go beyond
[02:54:21.680 --> 02:54:28.640]  conspiracy theories it's not been conspiracy it's been fact congress found in 79 that it was a
[02:54:28.640 --> 02:54:33.760]  conspiracy don adam speaking clearly and concisively when describing the events of
[02:54:33.760 --> 02:54:39.120]  november 22nd 63 the day president kennedy was killed and he doesn't waver from his position
[02:54:39.120 --> 02:54:44.080]  that lee harvey oswald did not kill president john f kennedy and alice in fact says adam's
[02:54:44.080 --> 02:54:48.160]  he says he has the fbi documents to prove it let's finish up with this clip here it is
[02:54:48.160 --> 02:54:56.400]  say it because the warrant commission is here and they've already ruled that oswald
[02:54:56.400 --> 02:55:02.480]  is the shooter and there were no shots from the front the army veteran wondered how oswald fired
[02:55:02.480 --> 02:55:07.760]  three shots in seven and a half seconds from a bolt action rifle i'm gonna tell you something
[02:55:07.760 --> 02:55:12.880]  right now guys there's no way in the world oswald shot that weapon and boy i mean i was really
[02:55:12.880 --> 02:55:19.680]  cautioned in don eventually retired from the fbi never thinking twice about miltear until 1992
[02:55:19.680 --> 02:55:25.600]  when he saw a picture in this book which he says positively places miltear in dalis the day of the
[02:55:25.600 --> 02:55:31.200]  shooting joseph adam's miltear looking at the presidential car moments before the president
[02:55:31.200 --> 02:55:36.320]  was killed at the national archives and records administration don found many reports missing
[02:55:36.320 --> 02:55:43.360]  or manipulated including his file on miltear from 63 everything that i had done was gone everything
[02:55:43.360 --> 02:55:49.840]  was gone but the most startling discovery was a tape recording captured by miami intelligence
[02:55:49.840 --> 02:55:58.160]  officers november 9th 1963 just weeks before dalis miltear is talking to the informant
[02:55:58.160 --> 02:56:16.160]  williams somerset the fbi headquarters and secret service both had that tape within days
[02:56:16.160 --> 02:56:21.520]  which are to stop the president from traveling instantly but they didn't and he says he was
[02:56:21.520 --> 02:56:26.480]  jubilant bragging to somerset you thought i was kidding when i said he would be killed from a window
[02:56:26.480 --> 02:56:32.640]  with a high-powered rifle despite all of that miltear was never even mentioned in the war and
[02:56:32.640 --> 02:56:39.520]  commission report when hoover set up the propaganda in the fbi don't embarrass the fbi that was his
[02:56:39.520 --> 02:56:45.440]  rules and you didn't so they ordered everything put into the archives and to be forgotten about it
[02:56:45.440 --> 02:56:51.360]  but don can't forget and hope something is done before the truth is buried forever i mean when
[02:56:51.360 --> 02:56:55.760]  we die off when we're gone there's not going to be anybody's going to stay here and tell you these
[02:56:55.760 --> 02:57:05.200]  things i hope the truth gets told whatever it is all right folks susan strafford fox 8 news
[02:57:05.200 --> 02:57:10.400]  we're gonna be interviewing him very soon but the issue is we have the deathbed confession
[02:57:10.400 --> 02:57:18.400]  of e howard haunt cia black op commander for assassination of leaders worldwide and he it
[02:57:18.400 --> 02:57:26.080]  had come out in court hearings before it was involved in dalas he denied it but when he went public
[02:57:26.080 --> 02:57:31.520]  it was planned in miami they were going to kill him in chicago a black secret service agent blew
[02:57:31.520 --> 02:57:38.960]  the whistle so they couldn't do it they killed him in dalas and i've interviewed the widow uh the uh
[02:57:38.960 --> 02:57:49.040]  well they were all basically common law mary but the mistress long time mistress um of lbj who was
[02:57:49.040 --> 02:57:55.760]  on record to be her uh his um mistress point is i always at the end of the show try to
[02:57:55.760 --> 02:57:59.760]  frustratedly get all this data out and then i kind of seize up because there's so much of it
[02:58:00.400 --> 02:58:06.640]  the point is they killed him dead in a hammer they did it in plain view i mean they shot him
[02:58:06.640 --> 02:58:10.560]  from the front you can see the blood and him shot in the neck then they blow the top of his head off
[02:58:11.200 --> 02:58:18.320]  and the dalas doctor said he'd been shot in the neck and all the witnesses saw the plumes of smoke
[02:58:18.320 --> 02:58:22.640]  then they killed the witnesses that saw the men at the grass you know the rivals boom boom boom
[02:58:23.920 --> 02:58:30.000]  we even know who all the assassins were that were there course it can hit men you name it
[02:58:30.000 --> 02:58:35.280]  because the cia likes to be able to deny they had hit men they had mafia they had white supremacists
[02:58:35.280 --> 02:58:39.440]  they had anti-communist they had hit teams everywhere in the u.s army down the street ready
[02:58:39.440 --> 02:59:09.280]  to kill kim if he got away
