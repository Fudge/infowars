[00:00:13.815 --> 00:00:20.504]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:00:20.504 --> 00:00:22.246]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:00:30.402 --> 00:00:34.549]  Ladies and gentlemen, hard to believe it's already Friday.
[00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:36.973]  Simply amazing, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:36.973 --> 00:00:39.217]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:00:39.217 --> 00:00:41.561]  We're going to be here live for the next four hours.
[00:00:41.561 --> 00:00:43.264]  I'm coming to you from Seattle.
[00:00:44.577 --> 00:00:57.784]  Which has been hit by chemical, narco-terrorism warfare by the big agri-companies, by the big pharma companies, by the globalists, where you have one of the biggest drug addict populations in the world.
[00:00:57.784 --> 00:01:11.112]  Wherever so-called liberal social engineers are in control, New York, Chicago, Seattle, you have giant homeless populations, you have a lot of working poor people, and their operating system is
[00:01:12.375 --> 00:01:17.660]  Hardcore leftists, anti-American, pro-Islamic ideology.
[00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:23.244]  Now everywhere I go, I'd say 60-70% of people know who I am.
[00:01:23.244 --> 00:01:26.667]  And a lot of Japanese and a lot of Asian folks particularly are fans.
[00:01:26.667 --> 00:01:30.290]  I'm talking about Japanese Americans, Chinese Americans.
[00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:31.832]  But when it comes to white
[00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:42.195]  Men, white professional men, but also white working class men, it's about 50-50.
[00:01:42.195 --> 00:01:45.316]  People saying, F you, go to hell.
[00:01:45.316 --> 00:01:48.598]  And this has probably happened, I don't know, 30 times since I've been here.
[00:01:48.598 --> 00:01:49.878]  They'll walk by and say, F you.
[00:01:49.878 --> 00:01:56.782]  Or they'll point and laugh, like I'm in junior high and that supposedly gets to me and hurts me because they're a peer pressure group controlled by peer pressure and fake news.
[00:01:57.802 --> 00:02:04.104]  But I decided the next guy to come by and scream FU and stuff and I was going to run over to him and say, no, no, no, do an interview.
[00:02:04.104 --> 00:02:07.305]  Well, that guy said FU and wouldn't talk to me.
[00:02:07.305 --> 00:02:09.065]  And I said, well, you have no intellectual debate.
[00:02:09.065 --> 00:02:16.348]  Then I'm walking back and a guy comes over and starts bumping his chest into me and says, I'm going to throw hot coffee in your face.
[00:02:16.348 --> 00:02:17.128]  He has it in a thermos.
[00:02:18.362 --> 00:02:22.183]  He unscrews it and then throws it in my face.
[00:02:22.183 --> 00:02:32.765]  And when I say that the people that tend to be on the front lines of globalist operation are goblins, I call them translucent skin goblins because they could be black, Hispanic or white.
[00:02:32.765 --> 00:02:34.566]  They have super white skin.
[00:02:34.566 --> 00:02:39.727]  They're always goblin shaped and they always jibber and giggle and revel.
[00:02:40.407 --> 00:02:44.429]  You know, we have all these tapes where they go, I love Satan, I love killing babies, I love killing my children.
[00:02:44.429 --> 00:02:46.330]  You know, we can put a compilation together.
[00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.371]  And I call it goblining.
[00:02:48.371 --> 00:02:53.374]  And you notice in politics now, they say the swamp, or they say the goblin's nest.
[00:02:53.374 --> 00:02:56.075]  This has come into the nomenclature, it's come into the vernacular.
[00:02:56.075 --> 00:03:00.978]  And this just happened about an hour, what, about an hour and 15 minutes ago, Zimmerman?
[00:03:00.978 --> 00:03:05.460]  Michael is, you know, the camera guy, so he went down there with me.
[00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.422]  And I was experiencing all of this.
[00:03:09.754 --> 00:03:15.802]  And then right after I get attacked, a guy's filming me, and I walk over and I say, would you like to have some words with us?
[00:03:15.802 --> 00:03:16.623]  Very nicely.
[00:03:16.623 --> 00:03:19.587]  He goes, I don't talk to effing Nazis.
[00:03:19.587 --> 00:03:22.732]  So see, this is the most dumbed down population ever.
[00:03:22.732 --> 00:03:23.893]  They're just like Nazis.
[00:03:24.534 --> 00:03:36.298]  Where you literally just demonize, first, alt-right, Hillary creates the term, she's God, then they connect white supremacists to that, then you connect it to all whites, all conservatives, all libertarians, all free marketeers.
[00:03:36.298 --> 00:03:39.679]  And I've had folks celebrating that they plunged the stock market yesterday.
[00:03:39.679 --> 00:03:41.920]  We started the show out and I said every newspaper I saw...
[00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.591]  I've been out and around town yesterday morning.
[00:03:44.591 --> 00:03:49.615]  At least nine newspapers said, the stock market's going to plunge, the economy's dead, Trump's horrible.
[00:03:49.615 --> 00:03:53.598]  And I said, it's a concerted talking point to plunge the economy.
[00:03:53.598 --> 00:04:08.448]  Well, they plunged the stock market yesterday with the hoax that the head of his economic commission, Mr. Cohen, known as a whiz-bang at free market systems, they'd help, you know, turn on the Chinese economy, that he had resigned.
[00:04:08.448 --> 00:04:09.309]  Well, guess what?
[00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:10.690]  It was a hoax.
[00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.191]  So this is where we live.
[00:04:13.206 --> 00:04:17.069]  This is the system we have with people cheerleading their own destruction.
[00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:18.311]  But here's the big news today.
[00:04:19.144 --> 00:04:23.166]  We had attacks in Barcelona, killing 15 people, injuring over 200 now.
[00:04:23.166 --> 00:04:25.907]  And the number's going up of dead, unfortunately.
[00:04:25.907 --> 00:04:27.248]  We had another seaside attack.
[00:04:27.248 --> 00:04:28.349]  How do you pronounce the name?
[00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:30.009]  I don't have my computer open.
[00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:33.531]  Another seaside town had a bunch of folks they tried to run over.
[00:04:33.531 --> 00:04:36.673]  One cop shot down four jihadis who were also armed.
[00:04:36.673 --> 00:04:42.356]  And nowhere in USA Today, New York Times, I've got them all right here, will they call it an Islamic attack.
[00:04:42.356 --> 00:04:44.537]  They won't even call it terror until deep in the articles.
[00:04:45.658 --> 00:04:52.287]  Okay, so that's their systems of deception and control as the leftists attack me in a terror attack.
[00:04:52.287 --> 00:04:58.676]  These are bullies, that's why they're allied with radical Islam, because they're bullying thugs who want to dominate everyone and who want to control your kids.
[00:04:59.833 --> 00:05:01.234]  Why is the fungus?
[00:05:01.234 --> 00:05:02.315]  Why is the mold?
[00:05:02.315 --> 00:05:04.056]  Why is the yeast taking over?
[00:05:04.056 --> 00:05:05.037]  What is going on?
[00:05:05.037 --> 00:05:05.777]  What has changed?
[00:05:30.073 --> 00:05:31.514]  We only have a limited supply of this.
[00:05:31.514 --> 00:05:32.534]  I want to get your reviews.
[00:05:32.534 --> 00:05:33.494]  I want to hear what you have to say.
[00:05:33.494 --> 00:05:34.955]  For me, it's been incredible.
[00:05:34.955 --> 00:05:39.477]  MycoZX, antifungal, antifungus, anti-yeast.
[00:05:39.477 --> 00:05:40.197]  Get it today.
[00:05:40.197 --> 00:05:40.697]  Limited run.
[00:05:40.697 --> 00:05:42.198]  It'll be months till we get more.
[00:05:42.198 --> 00:05:46.840]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.201]  I cannot sell something unless it helps somebody.
[00:05:50.201 --> 00:05:52.522]  And you can't support an organization that isn't fighting hard.
[00:05:52.522 --> 00:05:54.423]  Look at the response we're getting.
[00:05:54.423 --> 00:05:55.883]  We're changing the world together.
[00:05:55.883 --> 00:05:56.884]  You are the InfoWar.
[00:05:56.884 --> 00:05:57.644]  God bless you all.
[00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:04.793]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:06:04.793 --> 00:06:07.654]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[00:06:07.654 --> 00:06:09.656]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[00:06:09.656 --> 00:06:14.659]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.
[00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:16.760]  Research across the board is clear.
[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.041]  In fact, it's certified.
[00:06:18.041 --> 00:06:23.165]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[00:06:23.165 --> 00:06:26.527]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warrants.
[00:06:26.667 --> 00:06:30.029]  That your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[00:06:30.029 --> 00:06:33.031]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[00:06:33.031 --> 00:06:36.734]  It's loaded with good halogen iodides of the bad halogen fluoride.
[00:06:36.734 --> 00:06:43.639]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:51.144]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver and more.

[00:08:01.381 --> 00:08:14.471]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:08:14.471 --> 00:08:15.952]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:25.359 --> 00:08:31.406]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am very honored to be with you live on this Global Friday Worldwide Transmission.
[00:08:31.406 --> 00:08:32.768]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:08:33.999 --> 00:08:36.640]  We have massive Islamic terror attack.
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:38.320]  ISIS took responsibility yesterday.
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:43.622]  It happened before yesterday's broadcast even began, but the media ignored it for much of the morning.
[00:08:43.622 --> 00:08:56.466]  We now know it's 15 dead, hundreds wounded, and then there was another attack in Cambrius on the coastline at a beach town, frequented by Americans as well, where they tried to run over people with another automobile.
[00:08:56.466 --> 00:09:03.508]  Islamists jumped out, screaming Allah Akbar, trying to shoot people, and one police officer shot all four of them down.
[00:09:04.008 --> 00:09:04.168]  I think?
[00:09:20.345 --> 00:09:28.074]  None of it said Islamic terror attack, but right next to it, it said right wing attack from Charlottesville, Virginia.
[00:09:28.074 --> 00:09:35.783]  So we'll never hear about the one woman that died and how every conservative or every gun owner or every libertarian, you murdered her.
[00:09:35.783 --> 00:09:37.005]  You are a Klan member.
[00:09:37.005 --> 00:09:38.527]  You are a devil.
[00:09:38.527 --> 00:09:39.988]  And literally here in Seattle.
[00:09:40.959 --> 00:09:47.862]  This morning I was walking to a local famous bakery to get some pastries for my family, by myself and my camera guy.
[00:09:47.862 --> 00:09:50.543]  I don't bring my kids out here, obviously.
[00:09:50.543 --> 00:09:53.364]  These vicious frothing leftists.
[00:09:53.364 --> 00:09:59.947]  And they just immediately saw me, and I was doing a live feed about Barcelona and how the media was covering it up.
[00:10:00.347 --> 00:10:02.849]  And they began just going, F-U, F-U.
[00:10:02.849 --> 00:10:09.415]  So I told everybody, the next guy that walks by and says, F-U, I'm going to walk over to him or run over to him and say, hey, tell us something on camera.
[00:10:09.415 --> 00:10:11.357]  That guy said, F-U, F-U, and left.
[00:10:11.357 --> 00:10:14.279]  But another guy comes over, starts bumping into me.
[00:10:15.436 --> 00:10:16.077]  Over and over again.
[00:10:30.636 --> 00:10:38.502]  And just, it's this reveling in their weakness, reveling in their cowardice, reveling in their goblin-likeness.
[00:10:38.502 --> 00:10:40.003]  It's why people call it the Swamp.
[00:10:40.003 --> 00:10:42.625]  Well, it's populated with the goblin creatures.
[00:10:42.625 --> 00:10:48.469]  So that video is going viral on InfoWars.com right now.
[00:10:48.469 --> 00:10:51.151]  And I've had other folks tell me they want to kill me.
[00:10:51.151 --> 00:10:53.953]  And then they say, F you Nazi.
[00:10:53.953 --> 00:10:55.835]  And I saw another guy riding behind us, he stopped.
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:57.300]  to go.
[00:11:16.465 --> 00:11:27.291]  That literally form a false relationship with you, and then you have little alone celebrations in your little dank apartments on heroin, almost starving to death, just with roaches crawling on the walls.
[00:11:27.291 --> 00:11:29.373]  But it's okay, you've got Colbert.
[00:11:29.373 --> 00:11:32.514]  He's cool, he's good-looking, he's sharp, he's smart.
[00:11:32.514 --> 00:11:35.536]  He's a teleprompter character like Max Hedrum.
[00:11:35.536 --> 00:11:36.857]  He's literally just a creation.
[00:11:36.857 --> 00:11:43.240]  And then you've got the other actors posing as journalists who are really fake news, lying about what I say and what I do.
[00:11:44.699 --> 00:11:46.320]  And so it's very, very sad.
[00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:52.885]  I mean, actually, when he threw the coffee on me, luckily it's cold outside, so it burned at first, but, you know, dissipated in a second.
[00:11:52.885 --> 00:11:53.866]  I actually felt sorry.
[00:11:53.866 --> 00:11:55.026]  I was like, look at you!
[00:11:55.026 --> 00:11:56.868]  Look what a little goblin you are!
[00:11:56.868 --> 00:12:03.132]  And a lot of it was disgust, but also sadness that it's always the same.
[00:12:03.132 --> 00:12:05.374]  And it's not the obesity that makes him a goblin.
[00:12:05.374 --> 00:12:07.715]  They're very goblin-like.
[00:12:07.715 --> 00:12:09.577]  And always, like, they do this wiggle.
[00:12:11.894 --> 00:12:17.122]  This little wiggle thing they do, and then they smell, they always have bad breath and they're in this, the women are in this.
