[00:00.000 --> 00:13.520]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex
[00:13.520 --> 00:37.840]  Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones ladies and gentlemen
[00:37.840 --> 00:47.280]  it is Monday the third day of December 2012 I am Alex Jones your host and we are only 17 and a half
[00:47.280 --> 00:55.200]  days out from the planet Nabooru smashing into the planet and killing everyone according to
[00:56.320 --> 00:59.280]  a lot of people out there that are what I would call
[00:59.280 --> 01:10.240]  fantasy fantasy fans who then go out and give conspiracy theorist a bad name and that is what
[01:10.240 --> 01:16.000]  happens there are a lot of people that don't trust what the system says so then they just believe
[01:16.000 --> 01:23.680]  whatever they make up like they're controlling reality it's actually a step down from even what
[01:23.680 --> 01:29.600]  the new world order is engaged in they try to take reality and then distort it so that you're in
[01:29.600 --> 01:35.920]  their control system but the people always saying that you know the earth's going to end at this day
[01:36.720 --> 01:44.320]  and the earth's going to end on that day amazing so we've got a bunch of news on that today and
[01:44.320 --> 01:49.680]  then of course the bad news we knew it was coming but the editor of the New Yorker magazine doesn't
[01:49.680 --> 01:55.360]  get more any insider than that with the Democratic Party he's saying Hillary is going to run for
[01:55.360 --> 02:02.400]  president in four years so that'll come quicker than you know and I am not looking forward to
[02:02.400 --> 02:08.560]  Hillary I guess that's kind of what Porter Stansbury is saying the word is there's going to be so
[02:08.560 --> 02:12.640]  much oil money the government's going to have us now being the biggest to producer of oil in the
[02:12.640 --> 02:18.160]  world that government's going to control that and be able to give drilling rights and other things
[02:18.160 --> 02:24.720]  to certain insiders that because of that executive power over all those goodies that Putin's had and
[02:25.280 --> 02:32.640]  we've seen Saudi Arabia have and we've seen the leader the dear leader of Venezuela have that
[02:32.640 --> 02:39.520]  it's going to be used to basically get a third term for Obama kind of like what Teddy Roosevelt did
[02:40.480 --> 02:44.880]  and we know they've been they've had a congressman introduce legislation so Obama could run for a
[02:44.880 --> 02:49.680]  third time and there's so much election fraud they probably put up another corpse political
[02:49.680 --> 02:56.320]  corpse to run up against him that if it's not Obama for a third term it'll basically be Hillary
[02:56.320 --> 03:01.840]  so that will be her let me see one term two term three terms Obama's getting a fourth term
[03:01.840 --> 03:06.080]  and those were all really Clinton terms so the Clintons are entering their fourth term right now
[03:06.080 --> 03:15.520]  Obama is basically a Clinton frontman and so now yeah that'll be a fifth term for the Clintons so
[03:15.520 --> 03:19.920]  very interesting you know George Herbert Walker Bush for a great extent was pretty much president
[03:20.560 --> 03:24.880]  in both Reagan administrations especially if a Reagan got shot then he had his term that was three
[03:24.880 --> 03:31.200]  terms for George Herbert Walker Bush and then his son got two terms so that's five terms for the
[03:31.200 --> 03:36.800]  Bushes I think that's enough I don't think we need Jeb Bush or anybody and again their puppets are
[03:36.800 --> 03:41.920]  the globalists but even though they're puppets the bureaucracies that build up around them and the
[03:41.920 --> 03:49.360]  insiders even within a corrupt centralized system it's bad to have one group of criminal managers
[03:49.360 --> 03:54.720]  in there too long I think it's good to rearrange deck chairs and the Titanic myself just because
[03:54.720 --> 04:00.800]  of the aesthetics of it maybe light a cigar and Hillary is not lighting a cigar Clinton
[04:00.800 --> 04:06.320]  is busy her husband using those so it just kind of gives us a new enemy a new puppet
[04:07.040 --> 04:12.000]  and but when it's these entrenched criminals that know where all the bodies are buried politically
[04:12.000 --> 04:17.280]  they can really get pretty much anything they want done Bob Costas has always been a sniveling
[04:17.280 --> 04:24.400]  new world order minion and he used a editorial calling for restrictions on the guns as his
[04:24.400 --> 04:30.640]  pretext to push it blaming the second amendment that another one of their NFL spoiled brat reported
[04:30.640 --> 04:39.120]  drughead punks killed himself and his girlfriend that we should all have to turn our guns in
[04:39.120 --> 04:46.880]  how about you go to the river sticks and cross over to hell Costas you little sniveling demon
[04:46.880 --> 04:52.000]  you little elitist with your NFL propaganda machine selling us all your new older garbage
[04:52.800 --> 04:57.040]  I mean if that doesn't make you boycott the NFL nothing will we'll be right back
[04:57.040 --> 04:58.240]  back
[05:00.240 --> 05:07.920]  sodium fluoride in the body reduces IQ and increases cancers unfortunately fluoride and

[08:21.280 --> 08:29.920]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[08:31.440 --> 08:37.520]  what we're talking about here is right and wrong right and wrong a new world order
[08:42.800 --> 08:50.480]  a new world order do you like the new world order do you like losing all your basic rights and
[08:50.480 --> 08:57.200]  liberties like your currency being revalued you like a private world government running the
[08:57.200 --> 09:03.840]  uan announcing a hundred trillion and new global taxes they want you like the mega banks exempt
[09:03.840 --> 09:10.560]  from all laws and taxes the u bureaucrats exempt from taxes they hoist and foist on their own
[09:10.560 --> 09:20.880]  people well that's the model of the world that we are going into by the way we need to get uh the
[09:20.880 --> 09:29.760]  lead singer and founder of who's a listener of uh well the group you were just playing ministry on
[09:29.760 --> 09:36.160]  because he thinks the world is going to end december 21st 2012 and i know there's a lot of
[09:36.160 --> 09:41.120]  reasons people think that there's also kind of a romanticism about the end of the world i don't
[09:41.120 --> 09:46.320]  think it's very romantic and uh i'm going to publish an article either this afternoon or tomorrow
[09:46.880 --> 09:53.200]  with paul watson what that means is paul records me talking and then he goes and does his own
[09:53.200 --> 09:59.600]  research and adds to it uh and then we put an article together uh dealing with the reasons
[09:59.600 --> 10:04.720]  and the proof that the world is not going to be ending and obviously now that the uh the the
[10:04.720 --> 10:15.520]  hype over this uh is starting to really reach a crescendo and so um what does the doomsday
[10:15.520 --> 10:21.280]  clock say according to pacific time uh we've got uh how many days left of the in the world 17
[10:21.920 --> 10:30.080]  17 days of 17 days six hours 49 minutes 33 seconds uh but that is in that time zone so it
[10:30.080 --> 10:36.080]  you know it it varies uh when they say the nibiru is going to crash into us others say the galaxy
[10:36.080 --> 10:40.800]  is going to flip on its edge or there's going to be a pulse shift or any of that uh so i will
[10:40.800 --> 10:46.640]  be talking about that later in the broadcast because dooma that's the russian congress begs tv
[10:46.640 --> 10:52.160]  stations not to encourage into the world hysteria scientists assert there will be no end of the
[10:52.160 --> 10:58.560]  world well at least not then and so i'm going to do some reports this week too talking about why
[10:58.560 --> 11:04.160]  this is a hoax and it won't be the end of the world but real things that could end the world in fact i
[11:04.160 --> 11:09.840]  keep intending i was even going to make a film about this year's ago and got started on it but
[11:09.840 --> 11:16.960]  just so busy with the tv show and uh the films uh that we do daily and the research and the radio
[11:16.960 --> 11:21.680]  show i never got around to it but uh here we are so i'm going to make a uh report this week on that
[11:21.680 --> 11:30.960]  subject also we've got a bunch of uh big stuff this week on the radio broadcast john bown and
[11:30.960 --> 11:36.640]  crew have taken the entire ron paul farewell address and added news articles and video clips
[11:37.200 --> 11:46.000]  to it backing up everything ron paul uh talks about and so now it is a film on its own
[11:46.000 --> 11:54.960]  with his uh 58 his 48 minute speech and then change uh it is going to be powerful i don't know what
[11:54.960 --> 12:01.200]  we're going to call it we're going to premiere it uh wednesday night on the nightly news seven
[12:01.200 --> 12:09.280]  o'clock central info wars news dot com and then i will also uh play excerpts of it for the tv
[12:09.280 --> 12:18.560]  viewers and radio listeners here on well alec shone's live that's what we call uh the weekday radio
[12:18.560 --> 12:26.160]  show uh 11 a.m to 2 p.m central when i got in to talk radio 17 years ago and then got syndicated
[12:26.160 --> 12:34.720]  i don't know in 1997 late 1997 we had to go with the name of the show and the way arbitron works at
[12:34.720 --> 12:37.600]  the time is you want to have your name in the name of the show because that's what people
[12:37.600 --> 12:42.800]  in here and so then uh if you want to show ratings for your affiliates you've got to do that so it's
[12:42.800 --> 12:48.720]  called the alec shone show but affiliates now you know send us what they want me to plug in
[12:48.720 --> 12:57.600]  little promo pieces uh and uh i think the consensus is the radio show is called info wars and that's
[12:57.600 --> 13:06.240]  what i wanted to call it 17 years ago um but it just basically ended up becoming the alec shone show
[13:06.240 --> 13:12.240]  and then we call it on prism planet dot tv or info wars news dot com if you go there just a fact
[13:12.240 --> 13:18.400]  to it we call the three hour radio show each day alec shone's live because it is the live show uh
[13:18.400 --> 13:24.240]  some nights the the tv show is live a lot of nights uh it is a bunch of interviews and research
[13:24.240 --> 13:29.600]  and news we shoot and then that's taped but then we'll come back live and then some nights it is
[13:29.600 --> 13:36.880]  entirely uh entirely live or entirely taped as you have seen we are planning more live stuff
[13:36.880 --> 13:40.480]  in the future and we're nailing down satellite information and file sharing
[13:41.200 --> 13:48.080]  information and different things to try to get it on more cable and tv so that's exciting i'm kind
[13:48.080 --> 13:55.920]  of shag weighing off here uh in almost a corporate minutes of the info wars operation here this is
[13:55.920 --> 14:01.920]  my brain tends to just idle off into whatever whatever area that i focus and consciously look
[14:01.920 --> 14:07.680]  into i think we're all that way but um i think it's also a form of procrastination as i sit here
[14:07.680 --> 14:13.360]  looking at over 200 news articles all of which are incredibly important so let me just do this
[14:13.360 --> 14:21.040]  let me just give you a smattering of what's coming up here vatican introduces new security measures
[14:21.040 --> 14:33.440]  as the vatican leak scandal intensifies and it is microchip tracker IDs and if the vatican is accepting
[14:34.880 --> 14:41.760]  microchip identification no wonder discover and mastercard and visa are all going to thumb
[14:41.760 --> 14:46.560]  print paying or soon you won't even be able to pay with a card or if you do they're going to demand
[14:46.560 --> 14:52.720]  fingerprint certification and then they'll just segue into pure face scan and thumb print you'll
[14:52.720 --> 14:57.600]  pay with your face or your hand i seem to have heard of that someplace but you can argue either
[14:57.600 --> 15:03.040]  the bible is true and is actually starting to happen or you could argue it's really good science
[15:03.040 --> 15:09.280]  fiction you know written in the last 2000 plus years of the new testament old testament 3000
[15:09.280 --> 15:17.040]  plus years uh much of it and uh that bad guys went and read it and said this is a great idea but
[15:17.040 --> 15:24.160]  you can't argue that it's happening certainly certainly is certainly is happening also i saw
[15:24.160 --> 15:31.680]  a story today out of the london telegraph dealing with the their irs her majesty's revenue and customs
[15:31.680 --> 15:37.200]  is what it's called it's modeled our irs is modeled after that as pretty much the exact same rules and
[15:37.200 --> 15:45.280]  i walked into a dawn's salazar and curtain demo and i said uh you know guys that the irs is doing
[15:45.280 --> 15:50.480]  this now under patreon at compliance and it's a total violation your fourth amendment i said just
[15:50.480 --> 15:57.520]  go look up the fact that the irs is watching people's bank accounts through through through
[15:57.520 --> 16:02.480]  know your customer and suspicious transaction reports but that's just the the surface there
[16:02.480 --> 16:06.320]  they're dialed into your bank accounts it's part of why there's so much fraud you've got government
[16:06.320 --> 16:11.280]  agents stealing data for themselves selling it to mafia grips you name it they give unlimited
[16:11.280 --> 16:16.960]  fake uh well not fake the real but they give it to fake identities uh tax ID numbers to
[16:16.960 --> 16:22.000]  get tax returns and things sometimes tens of millions per household uh no one gets in trouble
[16:22.000 --> 16:27.440]  because it's being fenced into mafia grips i mean you don't think when they have you know some some
[16:27.440 --> 16:32.640]  homes getting 80 plus million dollars or 10 million dollars and you saw those reports a few months ago
[16:32.640 --> 16:36.480]  so you don't think that when no one's being prosecuted just because they want to let the
[16:36.480 --> 16:42.400]  family keep that money that's being fenced through mafia into mega banks that launder the money
[16:43.200 --> 16:48.320]  you don't think the 500 billion dollars a year in narcotics money going through the us
[16:49.280 --> 16:54.400]  it's over a trillion worldwide every year yeah the united states uses about half the drugs in
[16:54.400 --> 17:01.120]  the world and we're five percent of the population wow that is illegal drugs uh we are just absolutely
[17:01.120 --> 17:05.600]  bombed out of our brains on average we drink more alcohol than anybody in the world even the russians
[17:07.040 --> 17:14.640]  on average now uh but side issue is just little factoids there for you uh continuing uh here
[17:14.640 --> 17:19.840]  with the mafia government uh lock your doors and prepare to defend your family that's a new
[17:19.840 --> 17:24.720]  article by michael schneider from economic collapse blog we have up at info wars dot com and he says
[17:24.720 --> 17:29.920]  do you think that's an alarmist headline well i am not the one saying this yeah that's right i
[17:29.920 --> 17:36.960]  came out last week that is the um county attorney and people uh there in san Bernadito
[17:36.960 --> 17:41.920]  shame the government can't protect you protect protect yourself the city attorney of a san
[17:41.920 --> 17:46.800]  Bernadito California told citizens and it's a good article i want to tie it into no the world's
[17:46.800 --> 17:54.000]  not going to end december 21st but but but the the good in the world the justice in the world
[17:54.000 --> 18:01.200]  is dying the death of a trillion cuts and there are many many tens of billions of cuts into this
[18:01.200 --> 18:06.640]  process and it's only going to get worse until we stop being so decadent i think that's the
[18:06.640 --> 18:14.800]  central point that ron paul made during his speech uh some of the other news here veteran
[18:14.800 --> 18:24.160]  journalist describes sexual assault rape at the hands of tsa caron kaplan uh she's the editor uh one
[18:24.160 --> 18:29.600]  of the editors over there at the journal of nature and has been there 20 years and is highly respected
[18:30.480 --> 18:35.600]  yeah when people go in your pants and in your body it's it's it's rape but it's to keep you
[18:35.600 --> 18:40.800]  safe from al qaeda the government publicly runs and is giving libya in syria uh by the way uh
[18:40.800 --> 18:47.040]  uh maybe i need a document cam shot on this right over here's a good spot um i think we decided on
[18:47.040 --> 18:53.120]  this area as the document cam shot we've got to change the studio around a little bit um street
[18:53.120 --> 19:03.360]  artists behind statorical nypd drone hosters arrested and uh free speech is the is the absolute
[19:03.360 --> 19:09.760]  most protected thing and doing it physically is is the paramount and and the person to get
[19:09.760 --> 19:16.160]  attention went with their friends and put a few of these up in the poster kiosks uh over government
[19:16.160 --> 19:22.240]  propaganda that the government uses our tax money against us in new york uh and they've arrested them
[19:23.360 --> 19:27.600]  um they have uh now uh arrested the street artist
[19:31.360 --> 19:39.440]  and it shows an image of a drone and it says nypd and it shows the drone firing a missile
[19:39.440 --> 19:45.200]  and a running family and it's those it's those uh illegal alien crossing signs they they have
[19:45.200 --> 19:48.880]  i think that was a joke till i saw some in arizona because the illegals are running across the

[26:54.800 --> 27:02.960]  road trying to pull over to get it it was already gone but the point is i saw undoubtedly a global
[27:02.960 --> 27:08.080]  hawk it would look like stall speeds because those are supposedly jet engines in it and i've been
[27:08.080 --> 27:12.720]  in sessons my dad's a pilot you see when assesses flying into the wind it's going like 60 miles an
[27:12.720 --> 27:18.880]  hour this is going a little faster maybe a hundred and i looked at it i'm like that's a global hawk
[27:18.880 --> 27:23.920]  and i got to the office typed it in yeah that's a unmarked white global hawk uh i've seen a highway
[27:23.920 --> 27:28.960]  department drone i got it on tape pulled over and it was able to get it on tape and find the controller

[28:01.440 --> 28:07.360]  mq-9 reaper drone off without permission from the control tower a minute later he
[28:07.360 --> 28:15.120]  yanked the wrong lever of his control killing the engine without realizing why and now the 8.9
[28:15.120 --> 28:18.800]  million dollar aircraft belly flopped and then it just goes through all these other
[28:19.680 --> 28:25.440]  crashes of drones and drones over denver almost colliding with aircraft i mean let me tell you

[29:13.200 --> 29:16.560]  that's why when 9 11 happened and i said they were clearly remote control aircraft people
[29:16.560 --> 29:22.240]  are like they don't have that technology folks they had drones in world war two but i digress

[34:35.200 --> 34:43.040]  to have proven the artist's point months after forensics teams and a counterterrorism unit
[34:43.040 --> 34:49.440]  that's that's from a press release from the police department unit was spotted on the scene
[34:49.440 --> 35:01.120]  the nypd last wednesday successfully tracked down and arrested the 29-year-old art school vandal

[35:08.560 --> 35:19.280]  in iraq it's not the first time the nypd has overreacted unsanctioned public art earlier
[35:19.280 --> 35:25.280]  this year the department arrested a 50-year-old gentleman after he illuminated the streets of
[35:25.280 --> 35:33.120]  williamsburg brooklyn with harmless led pattern made from plastic i-heart new york shopping bags
[35:33.120 --> 35:40.160]  yeah all over the world street art is honored and even even political graffiti back to the time of
[35:40.160 --> 35:49.520]  roam you didn't touch it but they they hate this idea of street art they hate the idea that it will
[35:49.520 --> 35:58.000]  be written on the walls the prophets write it on the subway walls what song is that there's a famous
[35:58.000 --> 36:05.600]  song where and it's written that it will be written on the subway walls it'll pop my head in a moment
[36:05.600 --> 36:12.160]  the point is that's why we've had i don't know six seven contest to go and put just little
[36:13.600 --> 36:14.560]  posters up
[36:17.440 --> 36:22.240]  the sounds of silence simon and garfunkel maybe we should go out to break with just that section
[36:22.240 --> 36:28.000]  of you guys can find it thank you my brain's all over the place today my point is is that
[36:28.000 --> 36:35.600]  that this can bring down the new world order people really pay attention to even just a normal
[36:36.560 --> 36:39.440]  you know office paper size print out
[36:41.840 --> 36:48.800]  what is this eight by ten people really pay attention to this with something like read the
[36:48.800 --> 36:56.080]  insert on vaccines it's poisonous and there were hundreds of local tv stations around the country
[36:56.080 --> 37:01.200]  freaking out and calling us when our listeners hung those up all over the nation a few years ago
[37:01.200 --> 37:08.000]  they're in the fake flu crisis and and reporters from dallas and chicago and new york and and
[37:08.000 --> 37:12.080]  everywhere in between would call me and say are you afraid you're going to be arrested for telling
[37:12.080 --> 37:18.320]  people to do this lying and saying vaccines are poisonous and i'd say no i mean it's my first
[37:18.320 --> 37:25.760]  amendment it says they have somerosol mercury in them it says on the insert it can cause neurological
[37:25.760 --> 37:32.960]  disorders all i'm doing is saying if people through free association agree with what i'm saying
[37:34.160 --> 37:39.520]  whoever shoots the best video of these posters being hung up that way it's on cyberspace
[37:39.520 --> 37:43.920]  and physically that way we cover full spectrum we're we're physically getting people to do
[37:43.920 --> 37:50.240]  stuff to wake folks up but we're also then physically uploading it you know shooting video of it
[37:50.240 --> 37:55.440]  uploading it people are then seeing it and going out and becoming physical it's using the internet
[37:55.440 --> 38:01.840]  to get people back out there in the real world and i'll say to the reporters to the point if i
[38:01.840 --> 38:05.520]  didn't have time to call them all back so i just gave a standard you know info to my crew and they
[38:05.520 --> 38:10.640]  would talk to them and end up being recorded and put on local news around the country about well
[38:10.640 --> 38:15.200]  have you read an insert and a lot of the newscast they would go we actually did what info wars.com
[38:15.200 --> 38:20.160]  recommended and it's true it says it can cause cancer neurological disorders or even death
[38:21.200 --> 38:26.400]  turns out the signs though you can debate whether they're legal to hang uh we're actually
[38:26.400 --> 38:32.400]  telling the truth you know some of the reports were positive it's like the obama joker poster
[38:32.400 --> 38:37.840]  contest which by the way i'm bringing back i want to launch a second one uh in the new year
[38:37.840 --> 38:43.120]  here with new posters we design we'll have a contest on the best poster but also we'll have
[38:43.120 --> 38:47.440]  a contest because he is dictator obama now on every front we're going to go over that coming up today
[38:51.440 --> 38:56.320]  and we're going to have a contest of putting obama posters up again even though he's a puppet

[39:04.400 --> 39:13.040]  command center the law is dead to a great extent and and if we roll over to this take over katie
[39:13.040 --> 39:20.960]  bar the door you think things are bad you ain't seen nothing yet as they say so we have this report
[39:20.960 --> 39:28.160]  here uh and it goes on to anti-terrorism arrest of people i heart new york that'll get you arrested

[39:36.240 --> 39:42.160]  forged instrument and grand larceny possession of stolen property for his spree last september
[39:43.920 --> 39:48.160]  this happened a couple months ago with an additional charge of weapons possession
[39:48.160 --> 39:54.800]  after officers not servants allegedly found an unloaded 22 caliber revolver under his bed during
[39:54.800 --> 40:01.440]  the raid yeah i can't have a a gun in new york buddy as for the drones themselves the nypd has
[40:01.440 --> 40:06.720]  still not received any plans to use aerial robotic enforcers that's not true the faa's authorized it
[40:06.720 --> 40:11.920]  and they're moving forward with it as documented use of drones by local police in texas fox news
[40:11.920 --> 40:18.160]  it goes on from there uh there you go and uh they're proliferating everywhere it's the militarization
[40:18.160 --> 40:25.520]  of america and that's why this weekend this weekend drones to take over the skies of austin i'm
[40:25.520 --> 40:29.920]  going to have my crew retweet this article from last friday because i should have plugged it
[40:29.920 --> 40:36.960]  november 29 announcing the first ever info wars drone mob and video contest if i don't
[40:36.960 --> 40:41.920]  tweet this during the next break we remind me to have the crew do it oh my tweets are mine
[40:41.920 --> 40:47.040]  sometimes i kind of dictate them uh and by the way we need to get our twitter numbers up i got to
[40:47.040 --> 40:51.520]  twitter late and we're more of a conservative libertarian audience who's not known for tweeting
[40:51.520 --> 40:55.520]  and twitter i told charlie sheen i said you got to get a twitter account he got one he got eight
[40:55.520 --> 40:59.840]  million users so how was the guy got charlie sheen to get a quick i said men you i go you're always
[40:59.840 --> 41:06.640]  going to tmz to get the word out or something or me i said do it through twitter literally we had
[41:06.640 --> 41:11.200]  that conversation i'm not name dropping it just did happen and he flew in this big private jet to
[41:11.200 --> 41:14.880]  pick me up i'm like charlie you don't need to fly out here to pick me up when i come out to your house
[41:14.880 --> 41:19.520]  he lands this wide-body jet i get on and we have this big discussion about twitter and he went and
[41:19.520 --> 41:25.760]  set up his twitter but that's how charlie sheen got on twitter true story uh but um i need to still
[41:25.760 --> 41:29.760]  tweet those some of those photos but never even got around you know why because i got a droid it
[41:29.760 --> 41:34.400]  didn't work very well i'd not use it i guess i'm used to apple and then we moved and then the droid
[41:34.400 --> 41:39.760]  is in a box somewhere in the storage building so that's where all those great photos are but some
[41:39.760 --> 41:47.200]  really great photos but i'm not really a gossip show so i'll shut up now um drones to take over
[41:47.200 --> 41:54.640]  the skies of austin announcing the first ever info wars drone mob and video contest info wars is
[41:54.640 --> 42:01.440]  announcing the first ever drone mob event on saturday december 8th 2012 at zhulker park
[42:02.080 --> 42:07.200]  2010 barton springs road in austin texas and today we'll get out a map of where i think we're going
[42:07.200 --> 42:14.160]  to meet up and everything yeah yeah yeah 2100 barton springs road in austin texas we're going to
[42:14.160 --> 42:20.400]  do it out in that big field in the big zhulker field by the river out there by the soccer fields
[42:20.400 --> 42:25.600]  and there's no f a regulations below 400 feet and so everybody out there we're going to invite
[42:25.600 --> 42:30.480]  local businesses that are drone operators out there in fact i've got that guy's card somewhere
[42:30.480 --> 42:35.040]  that was working for the highway department um you guys dig that out because i don't know where it's
[42:35.040 --> 42:40.720]  at now and i want to call and invite him out i want to invite everybody out to operate there are
[42:40.720 --> 42:46.320]  c aircraft folks but the difference is police departments are getting these with cameras to
[42:46.320 --> 42:52.080]  watch us and they're bragging that they're using satellites to surveil us to enforce property taxes
[42:52.080 --> 42:58.160]  and environmental rules you've seen those ads where they go tom we do know where you are you live at
[42:58.160 --> 43:02.240]  and then it shows the satellite zooming in on his house the point is is that now they've got
[43:02.240 --> 43:07.760]  switchblade drones that they put a pound of plastic explosive in the nose of them and then
[43:07.760 --> 43:12.720]  fly them out you know to go into your front door and then you've got all the big high tech drones
[43:12.720 --> 43:19.760]  and reapers and the rest of them and this is the robot takeover rollout is why i talk so much about
[43:19.760 --> 43:26.000]  it this is the globalist program of domination and so drones are being pushed as fanciful but it's
[43:26.000 --> 43:31.680]  going to be ground robots undersea robots uh they're now talking about robot fish that are going to
[43:31.680 --> 43:36.240]  be in the lakes used by the police to surveil you to swim up to your house and watch you that
[43:36.240 --> 43:41.600]  was mainstream news last week they only cost about a thousand dollars and can go around for days so
[43:41.600 --> 43:47.520]  solar powered and then come back they can program a robot fish it's about four feet long it it goes
[43:47.520 --> 43:54.800]  out silently with a little tail motion comes up to your house with cameras videotapes what you're
[43:54.800 --> 44:00.800]  doing audio scissors as well and goes down the line surveilling backyards for pot plants whatever
[44:00.800 --> 44:05.680]  the case is homeland security grants this is in the news last week and we're going to pay to have
[44:05.680 --> 44:11.360]  police launching these into rivers and streams and all over the country per state they're getting
[44:11.360 --> 44:17.760]  in states like texas is more than 20 gun boats with high powered full auto machine guns to be on
[44:17.760 --> 44:22.960]  lakes and rivers not just the borders so it's just a full rollout yeah there it is robo cop
[44:22.960 --> 44:29.360]  homeland security adds underwater drones to their arsenal of robots based on fish yeah there it is
[44:29.360 --> 44:36.000]  there's the robo tuna unmanned underwater vehicle and and then you can go read what the police are
[44:36.000 --> 44:41.680]  calling for its cameras and the rest of it and i may come down there you know my children look at
[44:41.680 --> 44:46.960]  me every week and they go you know you even work on saturday now and it's not that they're guilting
[44:46.960 --> 44:52.320]  me though it really is we have a lot of fun together uh playing laser tag in the yard and
[44:52.320 --> 44:58.560]  going fishing and going hiking and painting and wrestling and so that's why I decided to go ahead

[47:33.920 --> 47:43.200]  of these and we normally put about seventy thousand uh on the street but within a day we
[47:43.200 --> 47:52.960]  sold out of the twenty something thousand we were holding back uh to sell in bulk and then
[47:52.960 --> 47:57.360]  uh had the five thousand we're holding back for any new subscriptions that came in this month
[47:58.080 --> 48:03.040]  so what i did is luckily a truck hadn't delivered ten thousand to san antonio yet
[48:03.040 --> 48:08.560]  so i pulled that truck and didn't distribute in san antonio i was going to start that as a test
[48:09.120 --> 48:14.240]  because people really are waking up down in san antonio or they're hungry for it uh and then i
[48:14.240 --> 48:18.080]  ended up there was five thousand hadn't been delivered yet in austin so i pulled those so
[48:18.080 --> 48:22.400]  now i have an additional five thousand but they're going so fast the ten thousand sold out over the

[56:13.040 --> 56:18.400]  from the kansas city bass writer jason whitlock with whom i do not always agree but who today
[56:18.400 --> 56:24.960]  said it's so well that we may as well just quote or paraphrase from the end of his article our current
[56:24.960 --> 56:30.720]  gun culture whitlock wrote ensures that more and more domestic disputes will end in the ultimate
[56:30.720 --> 56:36.800]  tragedy and that more convenience store confrontations over loud music coming from a car will leave
[56:36.800 --> 56:43.600]  more teenage boys bloodied and dead handguns do not enhance our safety they exacerbate our flaws
[56:43.600 --> 56:49.200]  tempt us to escalate arguments and bait us into embracing confrontation rather than avoiding it
[56:49.200 --> 56:55.200]  in the coming days javon belcher's actions and their possible connection to football will be
[56:55.200 --> 57:02.160]  analyzed who knows but here wrote jason whitlock is what i believe if javon belcher didn't possess

[57:43.600 --> 57:50.000]  i need to have my guns taken hey listen great cities like new york and chicago where they've

[01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:12.160]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:21.120]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:26.960]  by the way when somebody wants to ban your guns they are your absolute enemy because once they
[01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:31.840]  get the guns they've got the military and police train that the founding fathers are bad and all
[01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:39.280]  the rest of it they're coming after us and this world is ruled by violence as bob dillam was saying
[01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:46.960]  in the last segment and so we need the physical threat of defense to hold back the ravenous
[01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:52.560]  criminals on the street but also government and as it becomes evident that government can't and
[01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:59.040]  won't protect you in hurricane sandy or katrina as people see disarm populations murdered in africa
[01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:04.080]  and and you name it and people are about malice tongue taking the guns and killing everybody
[01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:08.160]  and saying political power grows out of barrel the gun people are out buying guns that's why
[01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:13.360]  this article i'm going to cover later lock your doors prepare to defend your family and that's what
[01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:18.240]  the police are starting to say because they live in the real world despite all the brainwashing
[01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:23.920]  the globalists give them all the federalization the longer police are police statistically
[01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:26.960]  the better they get on average because they start living in the real world
[01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:36.000]  they start becoming reassured when there's a robbery going on and the guy jumps over somebody's
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:40.960]  fence and the cop can't find him in the dark and a citizen says put your hands up and the cops able
[01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:46.640]  to arrest them police are living in the real world and so that's why i've seen national
[01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:54.160]  studies we've had uh jack mclam on about this we've also had that ahead of gunners of america on
[01:01:54.160 --> 01:02:01.120]  about it larry pratt i mean i've seen national studies in polls of police or 98 or pro gun well
[01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:05.600]  i mean they're around guns all day they're not afraid of guns anymore and that's how we're
[01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:09.280]  going to beat these people and if we beat them on guns and we're getting close we beat them on
[01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:14.000]  everything and i need to do a special report on this sometimes uh in fact before the year ends
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:18.160]  i'm going to do a special report that we're winning the war against tyranny in that one area
[01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:25.120]  but folks you win in one area and and and we ever overturn them in any area they fall
[01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:33.360]  so we are winning the gun war you do a report on that that is essential that i do that
[01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:39.280]  that and uh also a new report on the end of the world being a hoax uh but it could happen this
[01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:44.480]  particular this is the end of the world is just a total hoax but it could happen so i want to look
[01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:51.360]  at real threats and when we come back i'm going to give the number out on bob costes you know it
[01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:55.840]  sounds like oh don't be mean to bob costes people really become friends with their football commentators
[01:02:55.840 --> 01:03:00.880]  i got a lot of heat last year day one when i said you know the whole university heads were
[01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:06.400]  involved in the cover-up because it came on the local news wasn't national uh and you know they're
[01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:16.800]  running kids out of uh pedophile valley uh there at penn state uh black sunshine what's the real
[01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:24.480]  name of it's sonny valley a black sunshine valley devil valley satanic valley of course it's hooked
[01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:28.720]  into politicians and people of course it turned out it was hooked into homeland security of course
[01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:41.520]  it's hooked into all sorts of sooty groups i mean sandusky was raping children inside of the facility
[01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:46.640]  in front of people at you know in the middle of the day in public places
[01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:57.680]  and that showed right there oh my gosh this was covered up from the mid nineties it fit the mo
[01:03:57.680 --> 01:04:03.200]  of how they run these charities of of disadvantaged at-risk kids so nobody will believe them and
[01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:09.440]  we've seen this over and over again all over the world the globalist want power so they can
[01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:14.640]  do bad things maybe it's kill young women a lot of them are into that maybe it's kill young men
[01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:22.320]  like uh john wane gasey uh maybe it's hurt little children but they crave the power
[01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:31.440]  so they can do the crime and exempt themselves under national security and so that's why i get mad
[01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:37.280]  at the churches trying to act like they're on a high horse after somebody's sexual activities
[01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:43.360]  that are consensual with adults because it's all this obsession over that and never over the real
[01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:48.800]  abuse and and bad things and and killing that's going on you know they'll never touch the stuff
[01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:53.520]  that synthia mckinney and congress would expose and then half the time those preachers are the
[01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:58.640]  biggest freaks out there there's just total hypocrites is my issue we'll be right back stay with us

[01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:42.240]  times two different guys came over both times doing their their behavioral and analysis you become
[01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:49.040]  tsa with a two week course you take another eight hour course and you can now read minds and they
[01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:54.400]  decide if you get to fly now they decide if you're bad it's it's just bestowing themselves
[01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:59.760]  guys you go back in the proper room real quick there when you first come in there's a magic wand
[01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:05.120]  somebody mailed me because i used to do this joke with a pen and i'd say al gore waves his magic
[01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:09.760]  wand and says he invented the internet tsa waves their magic wand and says they've got to stick
[01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:15.120]  their hands down your pants it's against the law but they wave it and so now oh i had an eight hour
[01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:21.680]  course um smiling or frowning or sweating or not sweating or being talkative being friendly
[01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:24.960]  these are in the police training manuals too that umland security gives them
[01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:28.240]  police are all nodding their heads you've all been in the meetings you've been giving
[01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:33.920]  if someone avoids you or someone smiles at you or someone is nice to you and so many times i've
[01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:39.120]  walked up to cops and hey how's it going nice night huh well i'm waiting you know with my wife
[01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:43.440]  and the kids are in the bathroom this just happened a few weeks ago and the cops started
[01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:49.360]  looking at me and then they even knew who i was one of them's like you're alex jones and like
[01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:55.840]  there was this kind of paranoid i guess but oh yeah here it is i was mailed this i was mailed
[01:11:55.840 --> 01:12:02.240]  this by a listener and it says uh man bear pig al gore's magic wand wave it a couple of times
[01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:10.560]  and you shave the earth co2 problem and i forget who it was but it was i was lord montan i think
[01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:15.760]  yeah it was lord montan and he was in studio like six months ago and this has just been mailed to me
[01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:25.200]  me so it was sitting down the floor and he's like uh what is this i'm like oh it's just a
[01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:30.160]  wand someone mailed me let's not uh let's not look at that it just looked like total fruit
[01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:39.040]  basket land uh but um here it is and so you go take an eight hour course and you can now
[01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:44.240]  read minds tell them someone's lying which just means they get to now say i've chosen you can't
[01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:52.720]  fly i've chosen you can't fly and the and the really fun part about it is i've told the story
[01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:59.200]  of flying back to texas last year and the guy was like come with me you're getting a a pat down
[01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:04.560]  because you don't have to fly this is my administrative exactly what was my administrative
[01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:08.080]  right and he was smiling and he said he goes hi listen to your show i listened yesterday
[01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:15.440]  and i was just like i mean i kind of took it the way the guy was acting that i looked like
[01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:20.400]  maryland munroe or something to him you know the way maryland munroe would look to me and uh it
[01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:26.720]  was just this country so far gone but it's run by psych warfare people so it's all about what can
[01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:31.200]  we get them to accept because if they take us a million miles into bizarre tyranny even if we
[01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:39.440]  fight back 500 000 miles we're still there so it's like tying 15 bowling balls to somebody
[01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:45.360]  even if they're the best swimmer in the world you know you chain to shackles 15 big bowling balls
[01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:51.280]  to felps the olympic swimmer you know greatest ever and throw him off into the atlantic ocean
[01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:57.840]  folks he's dead felps is going to the bottom and so they put like a hundred bowling balls on us
[01:13:57.840 --> 01:14:01.600]  and we're trying to get them off and they're going oh there's no bowling balls we're like
[01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:04.400]  yeah they're announcing world government they're announcing that they're going to shut down the
[01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:10.560]  major roads and double our power prices and have all these new taxes and here's your own documents
[01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:14.240]  where you admit this is your plan to make us dependent on the state because you're scared of
[01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:19.920]  the free market wealth that socialist collectivists want to wreck wealth the general public because
[01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:24.480]  it's all about control because you're very nasty people no no we're not setting any of that up crazy
[01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:31.440]  person everything's fine just go to sleep it's like in 2001 space odyssey where they're talking to
[01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:41.040]  howl and they know he's lying to him it's like no i no doctor i i don't know about that problem i
[01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:45.520]  i don't know what you're talking about it's like when an employee you've caught him lying to you
[01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:49.760]  five or six times you've caught him like in the sixth time and you know they're lying and they
[01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:56.560]  still lie and they're lying smiling at you lying to your face and you're just looking at them and
[01:14:56.560 --> 01:15:03.840]  or it's like a neighbor you catch lying to you i mean at a certain point you know out of my life
[01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:11.360]  well i can't see finally i've grown up to the point where people act weird act strange act envious act
[01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:17.360]  bizarre act neurotic they're out of my life not that i'm perfect it's just that the luxury in my life
[01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:25.120]  is not being around people that act weird i'm just not there i'm looking up into the stars into the
[01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:31.840]  universe into science into discovery into things i want to do i live an empowered incredibly exciting
[01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:37.840]  full life and i'm not like up here bragging i do i want you to stop caring what people think about
[01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:43.600]  you stop uh caring about approval from the establishment because it's all a distortion
[01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:50.640]  and start caring about what makes sense to your gut and that is what everything good flows from and
[01:15:51.520 --> 01:16:02.080]  i don't know how i got off into this whole story of um the point is is that oh yeah people go well
[01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:05.840]  i know the government runs al-qaeda now that's admitted but it just people aren't ready to hear
[01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:10.320]  it well they better be ready to hear it because they're going to use this to take everything we've
[01:16:10.320 --> 01:16:14.160]  got they want to get rid of the bill of rights the constitution they're doing a darn good job of it
[01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:20.160]  with a wrecking ball right now the president is saying he's above the law on the military
[01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:28.320]  taxes regulations power plants the tsa says they don't have to go before congressional
[01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:33.120]  committees that they're above the law uh they're saying they're above the law on the internet
[01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:39.120]  censorship and control and the order's secret and congress can't see it i mean congress should be
[01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:44.160]  impeaching obama right now but the special interests that are financing the heads of the
[01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:49.600]  committees are the same ones financing obama and the same ones financing mit romney so they've got
[01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:57.280]  it's like a craps table where you buy you put money on every single space
[01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:02.640]  if the payout isn't set right the house is going to lose money
[01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:09.200]  you basically can't lose
[01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:18.000]  they got money on every single space it'd be like a roulette wheel if you pick red and black and
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:25.360]  every number or it'd be like if you bought lottery tickets with every conceivable prefects of the
[01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:32.160]  of the that's what they've done because and you're like well that's more money in the world
[01:17:32.160 --> 01:17:37.280]  that's what they've done they've created $1,500 trillion and they have simply taken control
[01:17:37.280 --> 01:17:43.600]  of the entire planet because they get us to accept the fraud they come in here with a magic
[01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:49.280]  federal reserve new world order one same group of banks worldwide and they go we give ourselves
[01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:56.160]  $50 trillion we give ourselves $100 trillion but to give it value they then make us operate
[01:17:56.160 --> 01:18:04.160]  and work i mean people's daughters will go out girls that should be marrying into great families
[01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:10.400]  should be writing novels should be owning stores should be doctors the cream of america goes out
[01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:19.360]  to elite bars and restaurants and lines up to be picked up by a rich man and they're not
[01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:26.080]  prostitutes they just get given money that's what america does because it's all based on a fraud
[01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:33.200]  and i don't want my daughter is growing up in a world like that i want to turn things back
[01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:41.040]  towards the light and it's all a magic wand it's all a fraud the only people they bust for

[01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:55.760]  of that down and more on what's happening with the tsa another veteran journalist calling it rape
[01:24:56.400 --> 01:25:02.240]  and that's exactly what it is but uh before i get back into the bob costa situation in the
[01:25:02.240 --> 01:25:06.240]  second amendment and come back and take your calls in the long segment uh joe rogan who
[01:25:06.240 --> 01:25:12.400]  i've known since like 1998 uh number one i think he's a really smart guy don't agree with all his
[01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:19.280]  political views obviously nor he he i he doesn't agree with everything i do but he's just a really
[01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:24.480]  nice guy i've known him known him for like 14 years now uh and i only get to see him a few times a
[01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:29.760]  year when i'm out in la or when he's uh it comes through austin and he's been so busy with his
[01:25:29.760 --> 01:25:35.200]  podcast multiple tv shows ufc and everything that he's been hard to get on the radio you know just
[01:25:35.200 --> 01:25:39.040]  because when you start doing this stuff a lot like he's doing now it i turned out most interviews
[01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:45.040]  you just get burned out but he said yeah come on out to the show got to eat and stuff and let's do
[01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:50.240]  an interview and so i went over there went and saw the show with uh i took david or tease marcos
[01:25:50.240 --> 01:25:57.360]  morales and rob dude did camera and uh we went over there and here's the best interview i've ever
[01:25:57.360 --> 01:26:04.320]  done with joe it did the hands down it's powerful uh because i talked to him before and after uh
[01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:12.240]  you know his uh peace and so that is going to be airing thursday or friday we'll air a radio
[01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:18.720]  version because obviously uh it's it's it's it's not not all the king's english uh and then we'll
[01:26:18.720 --> 01:26:24.080]  have an uncensored version for prism planet dot tv but we can warn people uh up front uh for that
[01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:28.960]  not that it matters but i've got to just say that because i'm on broadcast radio uh there's not too
[01:26:28.960 --> 01:26:34.080]  much but there's some of it now the point is i think profanity is bob costas saying the gun
[01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:40.240]  did the murder not the nfl player to me that's profanity uh people saying the family is arcane
[01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:45.680]  and bad and the state should get rid of the family as textbooks teach uh at all the major colleges
[01:26:45.680 --> 01:26:53.840]  just go look for yourself uh for uh the government uh systems of social workers that's profane
[01:26:55.040 --> 01:27:01.360]  putting vaccines and kids full of cancer viruses that's profane not the uh old english word for
[01:27:01.360 --> 01:27:06.960]  poo poo uh but just some of my own humor there that is coming up but but here's a quick clip
[01:27:06.960 --> 01:27:14.000]  from his podcast a few weeks ago uh a listener sent us where uh one of the guys he has on the
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:18.160]  show one of the guys that goes on the road i met him pretty nice guy he was talking about ritual
[01:27:18.160 --> 01:27:23.120]  is a good thing they ought to go join the masons things sarcastic really saying let's go infiltrate
[01:27:23.120 --> 01:27:29.360]  and find out what they're up to but i mean thanksgiving is a ritual uh reading your children
[01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:34.400]  books at night and saying their prayers is a ritual humans do like ritual see now all ritual
[01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:38.400]  turns into something bad church is a ritual and then they make the joke they know alex is going
[01:27:38.400 --> 01:27:44.080]  to get mad at us saying this and i understand the the joke is of a caricature of alex jones not
[01:27:44.080 --> 01:27:50.240]  what i really stand for uh but uh it's pretty darn funny it's the best joe rogan imitation i've
[01:27:50.240 --> 01:27:55.520]  ever seen him do and he does a great one of joe idas but i think in this he really is a master
[01:27:55.520 --> 01:27:59.520]  at this and he's getting better uh so here's a short clip from the joe rogan experience
[01:27:59.520 --> 01:28:03.760]  i have to go to the masonic lodge and be like i want to become a freemason and then they do
[01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:08.960]  like background checks on you and so we become masons yes let's do it i think it'd be a blast
[01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:13.440]  what do you think is good about being a mason i think ceremony is people are going nuts right now
[01:28:13.440 --> 01:28:21.040]  in front of the computer these shills these new world order shills where is the alex jones hotline
[01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:30.240]  number i need to call rogan has publicly admitted on his show that he is amazing he has
[01:28:30.240 --> 01:28:37.840]  done control on who talks about how wonderful it is to be amazing and spreading propaganda
[01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:43.520]  disinformation about masons being about geometry they're about control
[01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:50.800]  they're about taking your soul please gentlemen i'm not gonna stand for it
[01:28:54.640 --> 01:28:56.960]  man that is spot on i think those are actual quotes
[01:28:56.960 --> 01:29:02.240]  you know i'm in a big discovery channel show i haven't seen it yet but people tell me it's
[01:29:02.240 --> 01:29:06.800]  it's it's it's good i need to watch secrets of secret societies you think i would i'm in a
[01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:12.160]  couple episodes of that you think i would watch that but again i don't like joe rogan because
[01:29:12.160 --> 01:29:15.360]  he's a celebrity i like him because he's my friend for the long time and let me tell you
[01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:22.640]  that's the look for joe he's wearing a astronaut outfit an orange astronaut launch outfit with a

[01:34:14.720 --> 01:34:20.880]  here all right briefly and then i'll go to phone calls on the whole mason thing and i've always
[01:34:20.880 --> 01:34:28.640]  explained this it does a massive disservice to just get up on air and say the masons of the
[01:34:28.640 --> 01:34:33.520]  illuminati and their devil worshipers and they're going to kill you and they're the ones doing
[01:34:33.520 --> 01:34:41.600]  everything because about half our founding fathers were scottish free masons blue lodge
[01:34:41.600 --> 01:34:51.920]  people and that went back to sholomon's temple just to boil this down simply when
[01:34:52.880 --> 01:34:59.680]  knowledge was power just like knowledge is power today the formula to create diesel the formula
[01:34:59.680 --> 01:35:06.960]  to crack the atom the formula you know to make coca-cola taste so good well it's it's cocaine
[01:35:06.960 --> 01:35:17.360]  it's the same thing how to build buildings geometry how to construct things how to create
[01:35:17.360 --> 01:35:26.000]  a royal arch that was the most prestigious thing rock stars in every culture going back
[01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:31.600]  more than 5 000 years have been the people who were the master builders of the pharaohs and the
[01:35:31.600 --> 01:35:38.240]  babeloneans and the chinese the chin and countless others that was the real sign architecture and
[01:35:38.240 --> 01:35:45.120]  you didn't just give that science up to anybody so they had mystery schools that were private colleges
[01:35:45.120 --> 01:35:51.840]  put out by the priest class generally affiliated with the royal dynasty who also taught agriculture
[01:35:51.840 --> 01:35:56.400]  and propaganda and manipulation and they taught people how to make the public superstitious and
[01:35:56.400 --> 01:36:00.480]  tell them the sun wouldn't come back if they didn't give them more power and then the priest would
[01:36:00.480 --> 01:36:04.640]  say of the booga god is mad at you the sun isn't going to come back because they've been marking down
[01:36:04.640 --> 01:36:11.520]  when the eclipse would come so there's a lot of superstition a lot of occultic occultic just
[01:36:11.520 --> 01:36:16.160]  means hidden and that's where all of this comes out of and that's where the illuminati comes out
[01:36:16.160 --> 01:36:22.080]  of too but that's just history and so george washington was a mason but he was a great man
[01:36:22.960 --> 01:36:30.000]  i'm a lot of my ancestors have been masons you judge a tree by its fruits now that said
[01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:36.720]  one of my great uncles told my dad when he was a kid don't join the masons and he was a high level
[01:36:36.720 --> 01:36:44.160]  mason as high as you could get because so much organized crime uses the masonic secret system
[01:36:44.160 --> 01:36:50.560]  and the good old boy network to be able to get away with murder and i mean murder and i won't get
[01:36:50.560 --> 01:36:56.320]  off into all of it but texas was founded by masons most of my ancestors were masons and these were
[01:36:56.320 --> 01:37:02.560]  good people uh you know who you know one of my ancestors they wanted to be the treasurer of texas
[01:37:02.560 --> 01:37:07.440]  and he wouldn't do it because he saw it as potentially immoral but david errs but the point is
[01:37:09.280 --> 01:37:14.480]  that masonry itself and george washington wrote letters at the time about this and they're on
[01:37:14.480 --> 01:37:19.040]  the library congress website is typing george washington letters on illuminati there's a bunch
[01:37:19.040 --> 01:37:25.840]  of them how they threw france and the jackabins were taking over masonry and were illuminati
[01:37:25.840 --> 01:37:30.720]  and that they wanted to create hell on earth and that's what they want they want hell on earth burning
[01:37:30.720 --> 01:37:37.840]  cities raping everybody uh just death destruction held and want to pull down all the governments
[01:37:37.840 --> 01:37:42.240]  to then have a reign of terror and then build their new government which is an absolute tyranny
[01:37:42.240 --> 01:37:47.760]  after they destroyed the society and and and the the illuminati talked about how they used the masons
[01:37:47.760 --> 01:37:53.520]  who were upset about tyranny to actually help take over governments and then and then they would
[01:37:53.520 --> 01:38:01.360]  take them out uh as well so that's what's going on with this and and when you just come out and say
[01:38:01.360 --> 01:38:07.120]  masons are devil worshipers then people who are third degree master masons are all the way up to
[01:38:07.120 --> 01:38:12.160]  32nd degree and then of course the honorary degree of 33 it actually goes above that
[01:38:15.040 --> 01:38:20.240]  they don't know all this and yes the illuminati has taken over masonry you can argue where it
[01:38:20.240 --> 01:38:26.880]  came from the different branches of it it predates christianity it predates judaism it predates
[01:38:27.600 --> 01:38:36.320]  islam it is the old-time religion and it is at its base luciferian but
[01:38:38.160 --> 01:38:44.160]  that was overtaken and christianized and then just uses a fraternity of engineering and science
[01:38:44.160 --> 01:38:51.680]  where you went and shared mathematics and things it was the british masonic lodges with scientists
[01:38:51.680 --> 01:38:55.760]  that discovered vitamin c they didn't know what it was they just called it a factor in
[01:38:57.200 --> 01:39:02.400]  in uh citrus fruits and that's why they called the british limies and that's why they became a
[01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:07.200]  global dominant power with their navies because the french and spanish and others said all your
[01:39:07.200 --> 01:39:12.640]  superstitious drinking those limes you know when you're in your in your grog two parts water one part
[01:39:12.640 --> 01:39:22.480]  rum it's an old story the point is i said i'd go to your calls so much of the masonic lodge is the
[01:39:22.480 --> 01:39:28.720]  enlightenment is even the protestant reformation which no one can deny there was a lot of tyranny
[01:39:28.720 --> 01:39:33.440]  in the vatican and a lot of corruption there anything that's old over time starts becoming
[01:39:33.440 --> 01:39:39.440]  corrupt but then they simply overthrew that and set up their own system so it's just it's it's
[01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:46.240]  anything that gets too old becomes corrupt that's just it's called entropy and i'm oversimplifying
[01:39:46.240 --> 01:39:52.080]  all of this but you're not going to reach out to masons and get them to wake up to the illuminati
[01:39:52.080 --> 01:39:56.000]  by just saying you're a devil worshiper i know you go in there and cut the heads off of goats and
[01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:04.400]  rape kids that's not going on at 99.9 of masonic lodges masonic lodges are only a screening system
[01:40:04.400 --> 01:40:09.680]  for an upper society and you'll have lodges that are mainly scientific or lodges that are
[01:40:09.680 --> 01:40:16.080]  burrs or you'd have lodges you know that were military in order because here's the deal people
[01:40:16.080 --> 01:40:20.480]  that are successful don't just want to hang around with anybody because as soon as you become
[01:40:20.480 --> 01:40:25.920]  successful you immediately find out people want to get around you they call it's scraping on acquaintance
[01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:32.720]  in england so that they can claim you've done something bad to give themselves notoriety or
[01:40:32.720 --> 01:40:42.320]  so they can try to blackmail you or so they can try to uh suck off of you so whether it's low level
[01:40:42.320 --> 01:40:49.360]  success or high level success there are more and more elite pathways and it's all based on trust
[01:40:49.360 --> 01:40:55.840]  but at the very upper end of that it's all about trust in some really bad stuff see low level and
[01:40:55.840 --> 01:41:01.760]  i'm not talking about masonic stuff here i'm talking about business life fraternities organizations
[01:41:01.760 --> 01:41:10.560]  groups that's why i always feel so sorry for people who attack me or people that have scraped
[01:41:10.560 --> 01:41:16.880]  an acquaintance been on the show a few times stuff like that who then go out and and and make it their
[01:41:16.880 --> 01:41:26.240]  whole life to demonize alex jones i get sad but not in the way they think i get sad because i realize
[01:41:26.240 --> 01:41:33.920]  man that person is never going to be let into any polite society that's why david gergen when he when
[01:41:33.920 --> 01:41:38.800]  i told him i'd stuck in the bohemian grove he said you're not gentlemanly and i don't appreciate
[01:41:38.800 --> 01:41:43.040]  that you did that you made an agreement and i went no and he goes oh you're the guy that
[01:41:43.040 --> 01:41:47.920]  crashed it then he knew who i was and turned red and got my face and he said you're not a gentleman
[01:41:48.480 --> 01:41:54.960]  you're not you're gonna pay for that in polite society it was your blackball boy oh i'm happy
[01:41:54.960 --> 01:42:00.720]  to be blackballed by super upper crust carl rove of five administrations four definitely
[01:42:02.720 --> 01:42:11.200]  that's one thing but when you see people don't get this you blackball yourself in business or life
[01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:16.000]  and and and there's all these losers and they wonder why they're losers chief amongst losers are
[01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:22.880]  their lazy or they're envious of someone who's successful i've discovered that i've always
[01:42:22.880 --> 01:42:30.480]  been successful because i genuinely admire the strong i genuinely admire the beautiful i genuinely
[01:42:30.480 --> 01:42:38.480]  admire the handsome i genuinely and i admire the intelligent i genuinely want people to be
[01:42:38.480 --> 01:42:50.160]  successful and i found that is the one of the only prerequisites in life for success on the path
[01:42:50.160 --> 01:42:57.200]  of being a good guy the light side now the dark side you've got to have all those skills
[01:42:59.680 --> 01:43:03.280]  but then you've also got to know how to twist things and do all these bad things
[01:43:03.280 --> 01:43:06.880]  because you'll get shut down as well but but i see these people over the years that attack
[01:43:06.880 --> 01:43:12.880]  me and why about me and and i and i and i and don't they know that all they've done is blackballed
[01:43:12.880 --> 01:43:19.200]  themselves i never have to say a word about anybody to anybody i don't gossip to anybody i
[01:43:19.200 --> 01:43:27.280]  don't have time to gossip people that are successful immediately look into someone
[01:43:27.840 --> 01:43:34.160]  before they associate with them in any way it's like a bird will test a perch before it jumps up on
[01:43:34.160 --> 01:43:44.640]  it and we as patriots need to not have our culture and our society poisoned by cognitive dissonance
[01:43:44.640 --> 01:43:55.840]  sold by people like cast sunstein who said we'll go out and pose as alternative media conspiracy
[01:43:55.840 --> 01:44:02.240]  theorist and just fight with each other all day and that's done so that there's no society there
[01:44:02.240 --> 01:44:08.800]  that's done so that it is just a morass of infighting and mindlessness and most people
[01:44:08.800 --> 01:44:13.840]  that play part in this they're not even actively conscious of it the globalists just know their
[01:44:13.840 --> 01:44:18.480]  psychology and know who they are and that's what the illuminati's doing is taking the mystery school
[01:44:18.480 --> 01:44:24.720]  knowledge of egypt babalon israel and all these other ancient cultures roman greek
[01:44:25.520 --> 01:44:31.120]  and they teach this at the higher levels of secret societies you're not in a real secret
[01:44:31.120 --> 01:44:38.160]  society even if you're a 32nd degree mason because those are not just porch masons in their degrees
[01:44:38.160 --> 01:44:47.200]  they're porch masons in the lodge that they're in itself you know a police officer lodge or
[01:44:47.200 --> 01:44:55.200]  a plumber's lodge or a doctor's lodge you're not in an elite lodge if you're in a Yale lodge
[01:44:55.760 --> 01:44:57.680]  you are worshiping satan
[01:45:01.280 --> 01:45:07.200]  if you are in one of the big main national lodges yeah everybody there's 32nd degree
[01:45:07.200 --> 01:45:13.760]  or 33rd degree and then there's degrees above that so it's all about compartmentalization so see
[01:45:13.760 --> 01:45:18.960]  it's good to be upstanding and be in good society and to be known as someone that can be trusted
[01:45:18.960 --> 01:45:25.760]  that's where everything opens up to you because oh that guy doesn't try to burn people that guy is
[01:45:25.760 --> 01:45:32.800]  nice that guy is willful and strong and stands what he believes in but he's not twisted and just
[01:45:32.800 --> 01:45:38.960]  trying to bring people down for no reason that's called being honorable and in the power structures
[01:45:38.960 --> 01:45:44.560]  of the world secret societies as well all the way up to a certain level it's very moral people
[01:45:44.560 --> 01:45:50.480]  and that's what you'll find the devil's carriage as i've said many times is pulled by the good
[01:45:51.120 --> 01:45:57.280]  but the good who don't have the full picture that's why awareness of this and how this really works
[01:45:57.280 --> 01:46:04.640]  will allow the the the power structure to be removed because their own minions who think
[01:46:04.640 --> 01:46:08.880]  they're doing something for the greater good or who have been compartmentalized or twisted
[01:46:08.880 --> 01:46:17.920]  will see the full design and then understand where this road ultimately leads because all of the
[01:46:20.080 --> 01:46:25.120]  gentlemanliness and friendliness and and and and and the fact that you can be counted on as a
[01:46:25.120 --> 01:46:33.440]  journalist and not you know destroy your sources the fact that you can be counted on that will
[01:46:33.440 --> 01:46:41.360]  lead you automatically into success in life and then once you've hit that level there's a ceiling
[01:46:41.360 --> 01:46:46.480]  because then there's actual dark controllers above that and they will use people that are
[01:46:46.480 --> 01:46:52.320]  trusted that they can trust around them very evil people will actually be surrounded by good people
[01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:58.080]  generally i've discovered because they know that's who they can trust but all those people
[01:46:58.080 --> 01:47:07.280]  are compartmentalized you understand and so we do a disservice by attacking
[01:47:08.800 --> 01:47:14.880]  fraternal organizations and things like that because then the masons and people get attacked
[01:47:14.880 --> 01:47:18.800]  and they think well we're just raising money for school kids we're just helping in the community
[01:47:18.800 --> 01:47:24.000]  we're just helping do this and that how dare you say that about us and then that discredits
[01:47:25.680 --> 01:47:29.120]  everything else we're talking about so that's where i stand on the masons and i've gone over
[01:47:29.120 --> 01:47:32.960]  but we still got over an hour and 10 minutes to take calls we come back i will go directly to your
[01:47:32.960 --> 01:47:39.200]  calls and then calls throughout the third hour 800-25-99-231 kathy and phil and fred and brad and
[01:47:39.200 --> 01:47:44.960]  tony and many others we're going to get to you you see winning is all about having a superior
[01:47:44.960 --> 01:47:49.680]  culture people always say the globalists say there are no superior cultures and i go okay so
[01:47:49.680 --> 01:47:55.760]  i can't make cultural judgments about what type of food i like i can't make cultural judgments
[01:47:55.760 --> 01:48:01.040]  just just about what attracts me what type of woman attracts me i can't make cultural judgments
[01:48:01.040 --> 01:48:07.600]  about what type of laws i like i mean can i say the Aztecs were wrong to sacrifice tens of thousands
[01:48:07.600 --> 01:48:13.120]  every year to their gods i think that was really a degenerate culture that really fell apart can
[01:48:13.120 --> 01:48:18.800]  i say the nazis had a bad culture oh of course that's a bad culture you see they want to demonize
[01:48:18.800 --> 01:48:22.800]  the farming culture and call it backwards and stupid they want to demonize a hunting culture
[01:48:22.800 --> 01:48:26.880]  like we just want to kill things no we have a thing in our brain that we're supposed to go out
[01:48:26.880 --> 01:48:30.000]  and hunt animals it's not about the killing them in fact sometimes you're sitting there and you've
[01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:35.200]  killed you go well i better butcher this and eat it it's it's something you need to do it's it's
[01:48:35.200 --> 01:48:40.880]  it's a bestial and it's not bad to be animalistic at a level because you're meant to be like that
[01:48:40.880 --> 01:48:45.040]  you have the higher order on top of it in fact if you don't have your animal stuff fulfilled
[01:48:45.040 --> 01:48:51.600]  you're not going to have the higher stuff fulfilled but here's a victory everybody i know in the left
[01:48:51.600 --> 01:48:57.520]  all over this country is discovering firearms they're going out they're shooting them women
[01:48:57.520 --> 01:49:01.840]  are discovering single women how great it is to have a firearm women on average are better shots
[01:49:01.840 --> 01:49:12.480]  than men did you know that women are going hunting women are getting into real feminine power not
[01:49:12.480 --> 01:49:18.880]  the fake cia feminism see they always create a counterfeit of it and there's all these shows
[01:49:18.880 --> 01:49:23.280]  now on television i've been noticing when i analyze it where the women are living up in you know
[01:49:23.280 --> 01:49:29.760]  montana or or or or alaska and they're so happy statistically and i'm not saying everybody needs
[01:49:29.760 --> 01:49:35.280]  to go out live in the woods it's just that all the switches start getting flicked in men and women
[01:49:35.280 --> 01:49:40.800]  when you're living like we live for all these eons before here's the chronicle that has written
[01:49:40.800 --> 01:49:47.680]  cover stories on me repeatedly incredible lies i mean lawsuit city of i wanted to i'd own them no
[01:49:47.680 --> 01:49:53.040]  doubt hands down but i don't care because bad breath is good press in the final equation because
[01:49:53.040 --> 01:49:56.720]  i'm not just thinking about myself i want to get the word out the chronicle is now been having

[01:50:36.400 --> 01:50:41.600]  this is how we beat them we take the human culture and we stack it up against the globalist
[01:50:41.600 --> 01:50:45.520]  artificial culture because they have to have an artificial culture to dehumanize you or you won't
[01:50:45.520 --> 01:50:50.400]  go along with their system so all you've got to do is try to rediscover your humanity you'll win

[01:56:08.160 --> 01:56:18.080]  uh good afternoon alex um i was having coffee when bob costas started his gun grab mess and i
[01:56:18.080 --> 01:56:26.480]  immediately turned it off and ran for my second cup and uh it reminded me of a gun protest that
[01:56:26.480 --> 01:56:34.320]  was going on i think i saw it online and a chubby fella was standing next to someone protesting guns
[01:56:34.320 --> 01:56:41.840]  and he had his own little sign and it had a drawing of a big spoon on it that you eat with
[01:56:42.560 --> 01:56:49.680]  and it said this spoon made me fat and i thought it was hilarious and that's it that's it guys get
[01:56:49.680 --> 01:56:55.920]  me bob costas address i want everyone to mail them spoons with that we're going to launch a protest
[01:56:56.720 --> 01:57:03.760]  on bob costas but also the nfl because if they fired hank williams jr for saying that obama was
[01:57:03.760 --> 01:57:11.360]  turning into a tyrant when he is then i want bob costas to apologize that's all i want to not say
[01:57:11.360 --> 01:57:16.480]  my guns are the fault in this country not everybody's rich like you costas can have bodyguards and
[01:57:16.480 --> 01:57:21.600]  he's on record having bodyguards that's a great idea i want to get uh a watson or one of the
[01:57:21.600 --> 01:57:29.200]  watson's or one of our crew uh to come up with an idea a thousand dollar prize as well i'm sure
[01:57:29.200 --> 01:57:34.240]  there are lots of little things uh whoever videotapes in the next week you writing your letter
[01:57:34.240 --> 01:57:40.960]  nothing threatening and sending him your open letter to bob costas for the best letter shooting a
[01:57:40.960 --> 01:57:46.480]  video of you putting a spoon with the letter to mail it to bob costas we're going to launch that
[01:57:46.480 --> 01:57:52.480]  contest and we're going to mail spoons to bob costas that is that is a fantastic idea ma'am
[01:57:52.480 --> 01:57:59.280]  well it's not mine it was something i saw and it was just so hilarious and i said that's exactly
[01:57:59.920 --> 01:58:06.400]  the analogy yeah guns causing crime is like spoons making people fat right and speaking of food can
[01:58:06.400 --> 01:58:10.000]  i can i add this sure switzerland has a lowest crime rate in europe you can look up the crime
[01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:14.960]  statistics from the e they have total armaments everywhere i'm sorry go ahead ma'am so you know
[01:58:14.960 --> 01:58:20.000]  guess what else they're going to use our gmo corn for instead of fuel that's and all what
[01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:26.720]  what making plastics well you know it must be good for you yeah they can they can have gmo
[01:58:26.720 --> 01:58:32.000]  corn produce anything chemicals they can make corn basically grow gasoline they can make it grow
[01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:37.680]  hiv virus they can make it they can i mean that's that's pharmacological crops yum yum yum we'll

[02:00:57.520 --> 02:01:02.320]  chicago folks for folks to wake up out there and i know they are starting to wake up uh let's go
[02:01:02.320 --> 02:01:08.240]  ahead and talk to phil you're on the air how you doing that i wanted to talk about this
[02:01:08.240 --> 02:01:14.080]  bob costas thing i want to start off by saying i played football myself and it's a great game
[02:01:14.080 --> 02:01:22.480]  and there's a lot of things we can learn about life from playing football uh but the nfl uh
[02:01:22.480 --> 02:01:27.040]  they've been pushing not not only there's gun control thing with bob costas but every time
[02:01:27.040 --> 02:01:33.040]  you watch a game they're always pushing the wars pushing the military uh salute the service i mean
[02:01:33.040 --> 02:01:38.000]  it's great it's great you say okay we acknowledge no it's great on the surface but it's domestic
[02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:43.760]  psiop operations north korea has pro military stuff at their events it is it is when they
[02:01:43.760 --> 02:01:48.960]  have a touchdown they cut to the troops create a pavlovian thing where you salivate when you see
[02:01:48.960 --> 02:01:55.600]  troops while they're flushing the troops down the toilet exactly and and you can you watch it so i
[02:01:55.600 --> 02:01:59.840]  hope we want to thank them for keeping us safe everything is keeping us safe keeping us safe
[02:01:59.840 --> 02:02:06.400]  keeping us safe rather than you know you know what i mean it's it's basically teaching us that
[02:02:06.400 --> 02:02:12.560]  that the military it's like the rock stars and uh we're supposed to worship the military rather
[02:02:12.560 --> 02:02:19.440]  than rather than showing thanks for service it's more like worship worship military but it's only
[02:02:19.440 --> 02:02:26.720]  worship to accept the policy of the new world order global war exactly but and but last night
[02:02:26.720 --> 02:02:31.440]  when when i saw that blockbox this thing and asked i'm i almost i almost shut the house the game
[02:02:31.440 --> 02:02:35.520]  i mean i love watching no no you should shut it off listen you they know because they track you
[02:02:35.520 --> 02:02:41.200]  with the tvo and all those systems you're being watched what you're doing everyone should boycott
[02:02:41.200 --> 02:02:45.520]  football because of this listen if you don't get hardcore with them they're going to get hardcore
[02:02:45.520 --> 02:02:50.720]  with us they're going to take our guns they mean business it's look they kicked hank williams jr
[02:02:50.720 --> 02:02:56.560]  off monday night football because of his political speech it's time for us to boycott them i'm telling
[02:02:56.560 --> 02:03:00.320]  you turn off the game and tell other people to do it or you're going to lose your guns
[02:03:00.320 --> 02:03:07.040]  you got to get hardcore with these people how much do you want your guns of course we need our guns
[02:03:07.040 --> 02:03:14.080]  it's our last check on government but the thing is we need our football more well i play football
[02:03:14.080 --> 02:03:19.440]  and i want to watch it played at the highest level and i learned myself i know i'm sorry sir i know
[02:03:19.440 --> 02:03:24.800]  you're addicted but but but my point is is that you have to break the addiction you have to really
[02:03:24.800 --> 02:03:30.400]  make sacrifices like the forebearers dragging you know 100 miles a big gun with their shoes coming
[02:03:30.400 --> 02:03:37.120]  off in a blood trail behind them uh from ticonderoga you've got to make the sacrifice of turning off
[02:03:37.120 --> 02:03:41.760]  that brainwashing thing it's not that football is bad it's like you go to your church and then
[02:03:41.760 --> 02:03:46.560]  they put government propaganda into it it's not that there isn't something still good in the service
[02:03:46.560 --> 02:03:52.080]  you've got to leave that church because they become a government operation lacing cyanide into the
[02:03:52.080 --> 02:03:59.360]  message you've got to leave them is the only way to reform them do you understand that i understand
[02:03:59.360 --> 02:04:05.440]  it also pays my bills too so i mean it pays my way through school and it pays no listen listen
[02:04:05.440 --> 02:04:11.440]  listen i got the first year college football player yes sir well i understand at that level
[02:04:11.440 --> 02:04:17.680]  it's your profession and all of us have to make decisions in our profession uh you know like well
[02:04:17.680 --> 02:04:23.040]  if i go all the way on something i won't even be on the air so you know then i'll i'll i'll get out
[02:04:23.040 --> 02:04:28.720]  as much as i can i mean but i don't even go with that system anymore i just i can never really did
[02:04:28.720 --> 02:04:33.680]  but you do have to think about what you're saying so someone can't use it against you
[02:04:33.680 --> 02:04:37.360]  because that's one thing they do they also distort things but then you can't let that make you over
[02:04:37.360 --> 02:04:43.920]  second guess as well oh god bless you sir i'm it's actually formed in my head i'm announcing a boycott

[02:09:35.920 --> 02:09:42.000]  the biggest propaganda event out there is nfl and and and now if the spokesman of it is going
[02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:48.800]  to demonize our precious god-given human right civil right constitutional right we have to boycott
[02:09:48.800 --> 02:09:55.760]  them listen whenever the host of monday night football the guy that introduced it hank williams
[02:09:55.760 --> 02:10:02.160]  junior said that obama is becoming a dictator along with both parties are just horrible
[02:10:03.760 --> 02:10:09.680]  and obama was becoming and is becoming on so many fronts whether it's handing over the
[02:10:09.680 --> 02:10:14.560]  u the the internet to the un or shutting down our coal power plants and and exempting general
[02:10:14.560 --> 02:10:20.400]  electric outside of congress or saying nato in the un's over our military or signing statements and
[02:10:20.400 --> 02:10:28.160]  india and and and signing a secret cyber security directive and saying congress can't see it congress
[02:10:28.160 --> 02:10:32.800]  or the bosses they make the laws the purse strings the check on the balance of the president and he
[02:10:32.800 --> 02:10:43.600]  said that and folks he said that on fox news he didn't say that on the nfl broadcast and they
[02:10:43.600 --> 02:10:51.840]  dropped his contract now bob costas and i will guarantee you he got approval for that that
[02:10:51.840 --> 02:10:58.880]  is a the image of a sniveling establishment propagandists gets up there and you want my guns
[02:10:58.880 --> 02:11:05.040]  pal i don't like you for the rest of my life and i already don't watch football except when my

[02:11:09.840 --> 02:11:17.120]  never be any football on in my house as long as i'm alive until the nfl is not fully in the hands
[02:11:17.120 --> 02:11:21.760]  of the globalist as a propaganda tool don't you know in north korea and communist china and in

[02:12:12.960 --> 02:12:18.800]  gonna that's what i choose see at least he's honest about it you're going to lose the second
[02:12:18.800 --> 02:12:23.760]  amendment you're going to lose it all unless you start taking it personal we're the majority
[02:12:23.760 --> 02:12:30.480]  constitutional libertarian types every actuary out there we're about 55 60 of the country but we
[02:12:30.480 --> 02:12:37.760]  don't exercise any of our power we just we just let ourselves be run over i'm calling and i'm calling
[02:12:37.760 --> 02:12:41.200]  on you to help me i'm going to press release out today but i'm calling the media to help us out
[02:12:41.200 --> 02:12:49.040]  there the patriot media out there we've got to call for a boycott of the nfl and believe me it'll
[02:12:49.040 --> 02:12:54.960]  hurt them if just five percent of viewers tune it out if we can get governors of america behind this
[02:12:55.520 --> 02:13:02.240]  if we can get the nra it's over folks the nfl will apologize for taking a tragic event
[02:13:02.240 --> 02:13:08.880]  and some reportedly drugged up spoiled brat 25 year old punk who kills himself and his girlfriend
[02:13:09.520 --> 02:13:14.720]  and because he's out of his mind we are we need to turn our guns in so if somebody commits a
[02:13:14.720 --> 02:13:18.320]  crime with a knife do i have to turn my butcher knives in england's actually calling for that
[02:13:19.120 --> 02:13:23.920]  if somebody robs a bank in my city do i go to jail too that's that's authoritarian
[02:13:25.040 --> 02:13:30.160]  hey cops shoot innocent people all the time do we take all the government's guns oh no no no
[02:13:30.160 --> 02:13:34.000]  no predators bomb the wrong people all the time in their drone war
[02:13:35.520 --> 02:13:40.400]  oh no no they don't get rid of that oh the the military tortures people to death so we shut
[02:13:40.400 --> 02:13:46.640]  down the whole military i'm sick of this idea the highest crime is new york and chicago because
[02:13:46.640 --> 02:13:52.560]  they've taken the people's guns same thing la's dr conyan laws everywhere they take the guns more
[02:13:52.560 --> 02:14:00.000]  crime more crime more crime a street artist put up it's in the new york daily news put up posters
[02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:05.840]  showing you know a drone attacking pedestrians tastefully done just a cut cut away of a family
[02:14:05.840 --> 02:14:11.280]  with the drones flying over them they arrested him and are charging him with felonies because
[02:14:11.280 --> 02:14:16.400]  when they broke in his house he had a 22 revolver you'd be crazy to live in new york city and i'd
[02:14:16.400 --> 02:14:23.600]  have a gun you'd be out of your mind to live in chicago and not have a gun in fact i want to go
[02:14:23.600 --> 02:14:27.440]  up to chicago and see all their great museums in the history i've been there before i want to drive
[02:14:27.440 --> 02:14:32.320]  up there in my rv broadcast from there but i'm like wait i look at states and it's not illinois
[02:14:32.320 --> 02:14:37.920]  itself but it's a city do i like to park my rv outside chicago and then drive in and then will
[02:14:37.920 --> 02:14:43.760]  i be with my children and not have a gun i mean it's just it's incredible that we put up with this
[02:14:44.800 --> 02:14:49.920]  by the way speaking of chicago then i'm going to your phone calls every week at least i'm
[02:14:49.920 --> 02:14:55.680]  going to start plugging on the sunday show so twice a week our sunday affiliates and our weekday
[02:14:55.680 --> 02:15:01.200]  affiliates during the week and we've got over 140 am and fm affiliates now we're getting three or four
[02:15:01.200 --> 02:15:06.400]  a week sometimes more and some of these are 50 000 waters and stuff like bankersfield california
[02:15:06.400 --> 02:15:11.280]  turns us on this week i think covers the whole state it's got huge ratings already the fact
[02:15:11.280 --> 02:15:16.320]  that we're exploding like this is an absolute godsend okay and i'm gonna do the best job i can up here
[02:15:17.920 --> 02:15:22.560]  but i've been on and off chicago a few times over the years at a huge response but you know
[02:15:22.560 --> 02:15:29.360]  you're on a few years the station goes sports or the station sells i mean i was on um a fellow
[02:15:29.360 --> 02:15:37.680]  station in chicago was a wjjg like in 1998 99 and that thing had so many lizards it was probably
[02:15:37.680 --> 02:15:42.640]  like 30 of our audience back then you know the 30 or so affiliates i think i had more than that
[02:15:42.640 --> 02:15:46.400]  back then because i actually went to about 100 and went back down for a while the point is uh
[02:15:46.400 --> 02:15:54.080]  that i wanted to plug and every week i'll have a station in focus wckg chicago dot com wckg chicago
[02:15:54.080 --> 02:16:02.560]  dot com and everybody should go to that site you can also get their free iphone smartphone apps
[02:16:02.560 --> 02:16:10.560]  and hear all their shows and get their podcast and support them sponsor them uh 15 30 am wckg
[02:16:10.560 --> 02:16:14.960]  let's say you listen in chicago or illinois let's say you're listening to the free iphone app i've
[02:16:14.960 --> 02:16:18.720]  got you're listening to the audio streams or watching the streams at prison planet dot tv
[02:16:18.720 --> 02:16:27.440]  it doesn't matter tell five people a day about am 15 30 wckg covers all of chicago absolutely
[02:16:27.440 --> 02:16:32.800]  fantastic we're on there with man cal uh he's on the morning now i got a tv show getting huge
[02:16:32.800 --> 02:16:36.560]  ratings there there's someone casting his radio show that's really the model for the night time
[02:16:36.560 --> 02:16:41.360]  show that's where we're going so i've had some national networks talk to me and swear up and down
[02:16:41.360 --> 02:16:47.440]  that i wouldn't have to be censored or pre approved uh that guy was approached and offered the deal
[02:16:47.440 --> 02:16:51.440]  and i just said i don't believe it i think down the road you try to restrict me that they want me
[02:16:51.440 --> 02:16:57.760]  to do like a two hour show late at night like imus in the morning and it was just immediately
[02:16:57.760 --> 02:17:02.080]  going to be put on to millions of people but i'm just like i can't quit the daytime show that i
[02:17:02.080 --> 02:17:08.080]  mean i just cannot work all the time so i don't think the crew even knew about that but there
[02:17:08.080 --> 02:17:14.000]  i've thrown that out there i was approached by sci-fi and a couple others i mean i just you know
[02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:18.400]  leventura was told by true tv he'd be allowed to do whatever he wanted by the first season it
[02:17:18.400 --> 02:17:22.240]  already started second season they were censoring shows third season they totally took it and
[02:17:22.240 --> 02:17:29.840]  butchered it one side and down the other but wckg chicago dot com uh and if you're a local uh
[02:17:29.840 --> 02:17:37.440]  business there want to call their manager and sponsor the broadcast 6304263538 and we are going
[02:17:37.440 --> 02:17:44.480]  to plug every single affiliate we've got every week it'll be a new station in focus i need to
[02:17:44.480 --> 02:17:49.280]  do two or three a week though we'll never get through 140 affiliates a year yeah that should
[02:17:49.280 --> 02:17:55.120]  be our goal that that that that we maybe we should have like two or three stations twice
[02:17:55.120 --> 02:17:59.520]  a week in focus real fast but i'll have to pre write it up or i'll start blabbing about it for

[02:25:19.360 --> 02:25:23.600]  establishment of religion or prohibiting free exercise thereof or the press or the people's
[02:25:23.600 --> 02:25:28.400]  right to peaceably assemble for a redress of grievance but they are running it all over
[02:25:28.400 --> 02:25:33.680]  and i got news bob kosten i guarantee he was told to say that shut up and leave my rights alone
[02:25:33.680 --> 02:25:40.960]  you little authoritarian pig go ahead yeah alex it's it's uh it's our fault and it's not it's
[02:25:40.960 --> 02:25:47.680]  not his fault i mean i go for it would do away with people should not watch nfl football obviously
[02:25:47.680 --> 02:25:54.240]  because the powers that be have said go ahead and do this but listen we can solve these problems it
[02:25:54.240 --> 02:26:01.200]  is right there in that document it is in our laws you know we can do our do our uh you know don't
[02:26:01.200 --> 02:26:06.240]  watch football but what we need to do is attack these people where they live and breathe and i
[02:26:06.240 --> 02:26:12.000]  have a solution to the tsa problem i'd like to challenge people to go out and and do this
[02:26:12.880 --> 02:26:19.280]  the tsa is violating our fourth amendment rights i think we can all agree on that and line doesn't
[02:26:19.280 --> 02:26:23.600]  saying we can't film them and acting like drama queens like we've done like you don't like me
[02:26:23.600 --> 02:26:30.000]  sticking my hands in your wife's pants and into her body uh why are you with al qaeda no the criminal
[02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:36.080]  government you work for runs al qaeda publicly you little scumbag i'm sorry go ahead right
[02:26:36.080 --> 02:26:42.880]  so here's the answer here's the solution people you're listening do this i'm doing this there is
[02:26:42.880 --> 02:26:51.920]  a thing called a quo ronto it's a writ and the tsa is under contract to each of these airports
[02:26:51.920 --> 02:26:58.240]  throughout our country the airport and the airport authorities are the people that are responsible
[02:26:58.240 --> 02:27:03.760]  that's right you can sue the airport authority there's more than one way to skin a cat when they
[02:27:03.760 --> 02:27:10.080]  violate your rights and they claim this immunity it's a fraud take it to court challenge it take it
[02:27:10.080 --> 02:27:17.600]  to court and issue issue a writ of quo ronto and sue them and take away their franchises but
[02:27:17.600 --> 02:27:23.600]  this uh city of uh the county of albany i was watching your video on uh on that officer and
[02:27:24.480 --> 02:27:31.360]  bravo but the that the who was the guy standing there tell us the airport that's already had
[02:27:31.360 --> 02:27:36.800]  and i see people in that viral youtube video that jason mermas and crew shot for us and i see them
[02:27:36.800 --> 02:27:40.800]  in that video people like this is private property of course they can deny it no it's not
[02:27:40.800 --> 02:27:46.880]  you're operating it as a public commons where the bill of rights and constitution operates and if any
[02:27:46.880 --> 02:27:54.400]  tax money goes to the building of the facility you cannot stop filming they can call it their
[02:27:54.400 --> 02:28:01.520]  policy all day long it's incredible how they're they're trying to tell people they can't videotape
[02:28:01.520 --> 02:28:07.920]  their own backyards now and and he tells the cop in wink setting he says i want his id and and jason
[02:28:07.920 --> 02:28:11.600]  mermas is going i'm jason mermas and he goes i don't believe that get it for me wink wink and the
[02:28:11.600 --> 02:28:15.760]  cop's like if i don't think he's doing something wrong i don't have probable cause i can't ask
[02:28:15.760 --> 02:28:21.040]  for it yes police can demand your id that mean you have to have one you can't be arrested for failure
[02:28:21.040 --> 02:28:27.360]  id if it's not on you but they can ask you who you are and ask for it to see if it's there if they
[02:28:27.360 --> 02:28:31.520]  believe that you're involved in the commission of a crime it's called probable cause and then
[02:28:31.520 --> 02:28:36.640]  they've got to be able to say in court what the probable cause was or what the reasonable suspicion
[02:28:36.640 --> 02:28:42.800]  was that's the bare minimum but uh it's just you pull up to a checkpoint and cops want to see your
[02:28:42.800 --> 02:28:49.040]  id and smell for alcohol that's not reasonable suspicion that's hey dragnet nazi germany we're
[02:28:49.040 --> 02:28:53.440]  going to check everybody listen we got to start seeing bob costas and these people not as liberals

[02:33:02.400 --> 02:33:07.280]  the lowest taxes and the most freedom we produced most of the world's wealth we were those wild and
[02:33:07.280 --> 02:33:14.480]  crazy americans who came here through slavery and through adversity and as sharecroppers and as
[02:33:14.480 --> 02:33:23.040]  inventors and as swashbucklers and freebooters as trailblazers and so we're hit with chemical
[02:33:23.040 --> 02:33:27.120]  warfare the wild science are admits it they sit back and poison us we're now brain damage
[02:33:27.120 --> 02:33:33.360]  stumbling around in the haze but we've still got that vestigial second amendment laid down as an
[02:33:33.360 --> 02:33:38.880]  emergency sentry against tyranny and people know instinctively it's happening so they're out there
[02:33:38.880 --> 02:33:43.360]  buying three four five million guns a month ammo they're training they're getting ready

[02:33:57.440 --> 02:34:01.920]  collectivism's a way to enslave us but what do you do once they've already shipped all the jobs out
[02:34:01.920 --> 02:34:09.040]  and maybe before did they just starve these are all the debates we have to have but at least recognize
[02:34:09.040 --> 02:34:15.520]  that the collectivism was done to hurt people and disenfranchise them and reduce them down to absolute
[02:34:15.520 --> 02:34:21.600]  dependency and so when bob costes comes out and looks in the camera and says it's time to get
[02:34:21.600 --> 02:34:27.520]  rid of the handguns that's going to be the attack the second amendment they're going after the
[02:34:27.520 --> 02:34:32.080]  handguns and the rifles obama has said it in the debates the attorney general has said it
[02:34:32.080 --> 02:34:38.000]  they're coming and they've said they're going to do it outside of law we say that again alert

[02:35:03.680 --> 02:35:08.720]  helicopters flying over and police with machine guns oh they're going to have guns so they can

[02:35:17.520 --> 02:35:22.560]  hate the fact that we know them we see them we understand we've been taken over by foreign banks
[02:35:22.560 --> 02:35:27.040]  and that message is spreading so they're like hey have the nfl come out and call for their guns to
[02:35:27.040 --> 02:35:34.320]  be taken and if we don't stand up and and say this is tyranny they fired hank williams jr
[02:35:35.040 --> 02:35:42.160]  for telling the truth god blessing they fired him on another show he talked about it and he was
[02:35:42.160 --> 02:35:54.640]  fired after decades what 15 years of my football gone are you ready for some football you know
[02:35:54.640 --> 02:35:58.560]  and of course they've made what money i football paid anyway so that's a good thing less people

[02:40:24.880 --> 02:40:30.640]  means they're gonna be uh that means they're gonna be living to be old man doesn't it yeah hey i wanted
[02:40:30.640 --> 02:40:35.120]  that on that jovan belcher thing uh if you want to look behind the curtain really see what's going
[02:40:35.120 --> 02:40:41.120]  on here uh friend of mine was in kansas city sports radio and he told me that this belcher
[02:40:41.120 --> 02:40:47.760]  has been suffering from uh extreme headaches from uh uh concussions and i think this is just
[02:40:47.760 --> 02:40:51.760]  a smoke screen to get us talking about the second amendment from what's really going on he killed
[02:40:51.760 --> 02:40:57.520]  himself because of the headaches just like jr say i did here about a year ago and he just he
[02:40:57.520 --> 02:41:04.000]  couldn't handle it anymore unfortunately he didn't have the maturity just to uh take himself out and
[02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:10.640]  why do you have to take out somebody else but i think this is the the big the big story is going
[02:41:10.640 --> 02:41:14.800]  to be the concussions you talked about the us flushing the troops down the drain i think the
[02:41:14.800 --> 02:41:21.120]  nfl is flushing the guys down the drain with the head injuries you know i agree with you and they've
[02:41:21.120 --> 02:41:26.560]  had every manner of distractions over the concussions like the bounties with the saints and all the
[02:41:26.560 --> 02:41:31.440]  rest of it it is quite a soap opera i'll admit i don't watch football anymore but i kind of follow
[02:41:31.440 --> 02:41:36.160]  the soap opera of the whole the whole thing a little bit you know i'm driving in the car going
[02:41:36.160 --> 02:41:40.240]  to the channels i'll kind of follow it a bit or when family's over we watch a game sometimes and i
[02:41:40.240 --> 02:41:44.480]  could sit there and enjoy a game i mean i just being bombarded by propaganda during the ads
[02:41:45.040 --> 02:41:51.520]  is upsetting uh and i'm sick of it but but all that is again in fact i want to say something
[02:41:51.520 --> 02:41:55.920]  here on air i don't want to say i went off half cocked but i thought of what you're saying this
[02:41:55.920 --> 02:42:01.040]  morning and i meant to come on air and say that but what happens is i get on air in about 90
[02:42:01.040 --> 02:42:04.880]  percent of my iq goes out the window i mean that happens to everybody because there's so much happening
[02:42:04.880 --> 02:42:10.480]  that i kind of just automatically segment what i was going to say and what i meant to get up for
[02:42:10.480 --> 02:42:16.400]  today and say is this this guy had a bunch of concussions he was admittedly on psychotropic
[02:42:16.400 --> 02:42:21.840]  drugs uh the psychotropic are admitted to make you have psychotic breaks and not have impulse
[02:42:21.840 --> 02:42:29.600]  control so this is a story of gladiators that are brain damaged on deadly psychotropic drugs
[02:42:29.600 --> 02:42:35.840]  drugs that are known to cause violent outbreak psychotic behavior megalomaniacal behavior it's
[02:42:35.840 --> 02:42:41.520]  all on the prozac and that whole family of drug inserts they knew this in the trials in 1981 with
[02:42:41.520 --> 02:42:47.520]  Eli Lilly and prozac they'd had trials for three years before a massive increase it was a 17 fold
[02:42:47.520 --> 02:42:53.360]  increase in statistical suicide uh so there it is chiefs linebacker struggled with head injuries
[02:42:53.360 --> 02:42:58.080]  alcohol and painkillers before he snapped and killed girlfriends so yeah i'll guarantee you he was
[02:42:58.080 --> 02:43:03.200]  on prozac and or some of those same type of drugs probably out of his mind and i call him insecure
[02:43:03.200 --> 02:43:08.800]  i call him a murderer you don't know when you're brain damaging on a bunch of drugs so yeah uh
[02:43:08.800 --> 02:43:13.680]  i mean i guess we can say well he's a product of this just like the soldiers you can't really blame
[02:43:13.680 --> 02:43:18.240]  many times who serve six seven eight nine tours and are on prozac uh kind of like the guy that
[02:43:18.240 --> 02:43:24.400]  went killed 18 afghans turned out he was on those drugs as i predicted it's the same thing uh but
[02:43:24.400 --> 02:43:30.480]  but no it's not the it's not the drugs it's not the concussions to blame it's it's not even him
[02:43:30.480 --> 02:43:35.520]  to blame it's the second amendment inanimate firearm and that's what makes me so mad so i
[02:43:35.520 --> 02:43:42.080]  will put that in my point my issue is the scapegoating of the second amendment by the nfl do you agree
[02:43:42.080 --> 02:43:46.880]  we've got to get angry about this to make a big deal out of it oh yeah i'd like to make a t-shirt
[02:43:46.880 --> 02:43:51.120]  that says uh you think no cold brown simpson wishes she had a concealed carry permit and a
[02:43:51.120 --> 02:43:55.920]  ruger lc9 at her hip when she saw oj that night oh my gosh i'm gonna take that and put it in the
[02:43:55.920 --> 02:44:03.680]  report you callers just are geniuses exactly yeah i mean you got the knife and they they think oj
[02:44:03.680 --> 02:44:10.640]  did it who knows uh the point is is that uh boy you know it'd been really nice there in los angeles
[02:44:10.640 --> 02:44:14.800]  where they've disarmed the people i mean you know somebody comes up to me with a knife number one
[02:44:14.800 --> 02:44:20.480]  i know how to fight them a little bit uh but number two uh you know what most of the time i'm packing
[02:44:20.480 --> 02:44:24.880]  that's like oh you brought a knife to a gunfight that's gonna work out well i'm sorry go ahead
[02:44:26.800 --> 02:44:31.200]  oh that's fine but yeah i look over on simpson and uh was it wrong golden i think it'd either
[02:44:31.200 --> 02:44:35.440]  have been carrying we'd have had a we'd avoided six months of bad television at least though
[02:44:36.080 --> 02:44:41.680]  but it would have turned out a heck of a lot different you're an absolute genius okay thank
[02:44:41.680 --> 02:44:47.600]  you so much great points these callers uh let's talk to michael in kentucky you're on the year welcome
[02:44:47.600 --> 02:44:51.280]  Alex yes sir
[02:44:53.200 --> 02:45:02.880]  bob costes is a minion he is a joker sitting in a jester suit at the coliseum while roam is falling
[02:45:02.880 --> 02:45:09.760]  apart just waiting and helping our country to fall down by saying these stupid comments
[02:45:10.800 --> 02:45:15.680]  yes absolutely and believe me they may try to go at the guns they're bold they're they're saying
[02:45:15.680 --> 02:45:20.000]  the un runs our military they're saying obama could shut down the internet without congressional law
[02:45:20.560 --> 02:45:25.440]  uh that would be unconstitutional uh they're doing it all and they are planning to try to ban
[02:45:25.440 --> 02:45:30.720]  semi-autos they're going to start with registering and they're going to go out and and and burn and
[02:45:30.720 --> 02:45:34.640]  scare people and have shootouts with people they're going to start a civil war and they're
[02:45:34.640 --> 02:45:38.800]  going to sit back while the police and military get destroyed and that's the globalist plan
[02:45:38.800 --> 02:45:44.560]  is to have us kill each other does that little i agree but we have to now go after costes so the
[02:45:44.560 --> 02:45:46.800]  other minions won't follow orders you understand
[02:45:49.440 --> 02:45:55.920]  Steve quail was on your show this summer and he said something uh quite quite interesting
[02:45:56.720 --> 02:46:03.760]  and uh i know you've heard of a kentucky long rifle before alice we are the pioneer state kentucky
[02:46:03.760 --> 02:46:15.120]  and if the globalist come out hard you see kentucky fall you know they're coming out hard i hear you
[02:46:15.120 --> 02:46:20.800]  good old kentucky long rifle of course i know what that is you're talking about uh baby crocket and
[02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:31.600]  all right let's uh let's go ahead now and uh talk to jack in michigan jack you ready to
[02:46:31.600 --> 02:46:35.760]  turn your guns in because the nfl said so it's manly turn your guns in
[02:46:37.040 --> 02:46:42.880]  have them all after they get my bullets anyways i wanted to call just because the sport listened
[02:46:42.880 --> 02:46:48.400]  to uh talk radio they were ranting and raving about gun culture with the nfl and i had to get
[02:46:48.400 --> 02:46:53.680]  on the phone you know point out that the one thing common to all this is the uh pharmaceutical
[02:46:53.680 --> 02:46:58.640]  drugs and why aren't they being blamed and after that phone call they said well we can't look at the
[02:46:58.640 --> 02:47:05.760]  drugs and the alcohol we have to look at the person so it clearly is their chance to go after the guns
[02:47:05.760 --> 02:47:09.440]  yeah yeah they're not going after concussions they're not going after prescription drugs
[02:47:09.440 --> 02:47:19.280]  they're going after our guns and again hank williams jr fired fired for saying it on another
[02:47:19.280 --> 02:47:28.000]  network this is during the football game well i i truly believe the nfl is a globalist controlled
[02:47:28.000 --> 02:47:34.320]  network to get control of the uh sports junkies and the other they're feeling you're saying you're
[02:47:34.320 --> 02:47:43.040]  saying espn people were regurgitating this oh yeah they were regurgitating over and over and over
[02:47:43.040 --> 02:47:48.720]  again how you know there's a culture of guns in the nfl and it's all these guns and they all
[02:47:48.720 --> 02:47:55.200]  have these guns and they're all you know without no no no no what it is see that it's not the gun
[02:47:55.200 --> 02:48:01.920]  culture there's a gangster thug life culture in the nfl there's a there's a pit bull you know
[02:48:02.640 --> 02:48:11.760]  all that stuff it's a thug culture well and you know it was just funny until i pointed out a
[02:48:11.760 --> 02:48:16.240]  pharmaceuticals could be the issue here let's look at that then it was no no no let's just
[02:48:16.240 --> 02:48:20.080]  look at the uh person it's all about the individual well let me tell you something it
[02:48:20.080 --> 02:48:24.400]  isn't gonna fly with football fans most of them are constitutionalist or libertarians
[02:48:24.400 --> 02:48:28.000]  i mean you know i mean trendies don't even like watching simulated combat
[02:48:28.960 --> 02:48:33.920]  and so this is not going to go over well listen i'm coming out against the nfl full time now
[02:48:33.920 --> 02:48:38.320]  i should have done it a long time it is on it is on let me tell you something they get
[02:48:38.320 --> 02:48:42.720]  away they don't get slapped down on this they're going to go all the way they are they are they've
[02:48:42.720 --> 02:48:46.960]  got a hundred yard drive against us and we've got to smash them and hold them right where they are
[02:48:46.960 --> 02:48:52.080]  to use an nfl analogy good to hear from you chad in kentucky a lot of calls from kentucky
[02:48:52.080 --> 02:48:59.120]  go ahead you're on the air hey alex uh let's listen to you but uh coming on the guns one thing
[02:48:59.120 --> 02:49:03.600]  that i was thinking about they've been doing a lot of studies with these nfl players and their
[02:49:03.600 --> 02:49:09.440]  concussions what if they did something with the ptsd and the soldiers and then made you when you
[02:49:09.440 --> 02:49:14.720]  registered for a gun had to fill out if you've had a concussion or looked at your medical history
[02:49:14.720 --> 02:49:18.880]  no no no no that's the plan they're going to medicalize everything and just say it's not
[02:49:18.880 --> 02:49:23.520]  if you're a felon now we'll just say you've got a mental problem and they want to now diagnose

[03:00:34.880 --> 03:00:41.280]  salvo for obama and and the coming after our guns what do you say to that well i just want to say
[03:00:41.280 --> 03:00:47.280]  that i talk with a um full board colonel who'd retired from the infantry and he was saying
[03:00:47.280 --> 03:00:53.680]  that they were having problems in afghanistan in iraq because when they first started to win and
[03:00:53.680 --> 03:00:59.200]  get the guns they could find them in the house but the uh the people that were getting their
[03:00:59.200 --> 03:01:05.040]  guns these figured out if they had an ak-47 they could bury it in the ground and dig it up and then
[03:01:05.040 --> 03:01:12.640]  it'll still fire and i'm just wondering if a lot of people in america have their m 16s or whatever
[03:01:12.640 --> 03:01:17.280]  version of that and look at the days he's growing in the spring to bears go potty in the woods

[03:01:29.360 --> 03:01:32.960]  and and that's part of the plan they're going to launch the police the military against us
[03:01:32.960 --> 03:01:37.200]  and that's to wipe them out and us they'll do it i mean they're you know they want it
[03:01:38.400 --> 03:01:42.240]  i'm sorry go ahead so the globalists hate us so bad they want to really take their time with
[03:01:42.240 --> 03:01:47.200]  the reeducation camps and the mass arrests and the forced labor and the torturing our kids
