[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.000 --> 00:27.680]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:27.680 --> 00:34.200]  Things are really getting beyond surreal right now. They've had the FBI come out and say
[00:34.200 --> 00:42.560]  that police saying, hey, let's burn down. Dorner's cabin aren't really saying, let's
[00:42.560 --> 00:48.440]  burn down his cabin. Burn that house down, burn it down, burn it down.
[00:48.440 --> 00:56.200]  We've got now four different scanner clips of this being said. And they just say, no,
[00:56.200 --> 01:00.460]  you didn't see that. It's literally a Jedi mind trick. These aren't the droids you're
[01:00.460 --> 01:08.080]  looking for, move along. And it just shows how crazy things have gotten, where the Congress
[01:08.080 --> 01:14.040]  insider trades gets caught engaging in incredible crimes and just says, well, it's not crime
[01:14.040 --> 01:19.480]  when we do it.
[01:19.480 --> 01:23.840]  And I see the globalists exempting themselves from taxes, the president exempting himself
[01:23.840 --> 01:29.600]  from the Constitution, openly violating it, openly carrying out fast and furious, openly
[01:29.600 --> 01:37.800]  caught lying, openly putting our military under NATO control. And now, in New York State,
[01:37.800 --> 01:42.200]  they've passed the laws. In Missouri, they're trying to pass them. In Washington State,
[01:42.200 --> 01:46.120]  in Oregon, I mean, this is off the charts.
[01:46.120 --> 01:52.940]  They have bills to physically make you turn them in. This is from the Gateway Pundit directly
[01:52.940 --> 01:58.360]  from the Missouri bill. The Democratic bill in Missouri removed the assault weapon or
[01:58.360 --> 02:03.320]  large capacity magazine from the state of Missouri. That's part one of the bill. Render
[02:03.320 --> 02:06.920]  the assault weapon permanently inoperable, that's spiking it.
[02:06.920 --> 02:12.200]  Or surrender the assault weapon or large capacity magazine to the appropriate law enforcement
[02:12.200 --> 02:19.160]  agency for destruction, subject to the specific agency regulations. Outlaw the importation,
[02:19.160 --> 02:23.640]  possession, purchase, sale. And I went and looked, that is what they're proposing.
[02:23.640 --> 02:27.920]  Here's another one. Washington State bill would make almost all gun owners criminals,
[02:27.920 --> 02:33.800]  banning almost all guns, SB 5737. But meanwhile, they're saying, we don't want your guns, we
[02:33.800 --> 02:36.760]  don't want your guns. That's why it blew up at Piers Morgan. He's like, nobody wants to
[02:36.760 --> 02:37.760]  take your guns.
[02:37.760 --> 02:41.360]  Really, you got a whole bunch of bills introduced to do it. You've called for the abolition
[02:41.360 --> 02:47.400]  the UN has. Obama did as a state senator, stop talking to me like I'm a two-year-old.
[02:47.400 --> 02:55.000]  Do you understand you filthy con artist? I'm sick of your crap. I'm sick of it. I'm sick
[02:55.000 --> 02:59.400]  of it, okay? I'm not under some trance where you burn things down and tell me you didn't
[02:59.400 --> 03:01.200]  burn them down.
[03:01.200 --> 03:10.120]  We have the stinking flare footage of them at Waco killing everybody. We have the Delta
[03:10.120 --> 03:13.520]  Force orders to go in and kill them, came out in Congress. But they get on the news
[03:13.520 --> 03:18.600]  and say, the Davidians burned themselves up. And now they're all on tape saying, burn him
[03:18.600 --> 03:23.000]  up, burn the mother effer up, burn that house down, burn it down, get the gas, shut the
[03:23.000 --> 03:27.040]  burners, the burners are shit, the house is on fire.
[03:27.040 --> 03:34.960]  And I've got the sheriff of the Big Bear area on video coming up saying, hey, we didn't
[03:34.960 --> 03:41.120]  essentially intentionally set any fires. I wonder who would work with cops if you're
[03:41.120 --> 03:44.880]  robbing a bank, had big bags of money over your shoulder, wearing a little mask. And
[03:44.880 --> 03:47.840]  they got their guns on you and they say, hey, stop, freeze.
[03:47.840 --> 03:52.240]  You go, no, I'm not robbing the bank. I'm not a robber. They'd probably say, you're
[03:52.240 --> 03:56.640]  right, he's not. Actually, they wouldn't, but if you were wearing a uniform, they might.
[03:56.640 --> 04:01.720]  If you had like a mustache and a bald head and were the square jawed cop and said, I'm
[04:01.720 --> 04:06.480]  not robbing the bank. Well, let us hope you load that money up then. I mean, it is just
[04:06.480 --> 04:18.160]  getting ridiculous. It is preposterous. It is absolutely balderdash, cockamamie, horsemaner,
[04:18.160 --> 04:21.440]  baloney, fraudulent trash.
[04:21.440 --> 04:25.160]  And it's the same everywhere. People are delusional about their kids. They're delusional about
[04:25.160 --> 04:29.400]  their health. They're delusional about their paycheck. We're delusional about the dollar
[04:29.400 --> 04:35.600]  and the inflation and the doubling the national debt under Obama. And it's just going to go
[04:35.600 --> 04:41.320]  absolutely off the tracks. In fact, the train's already off the tracks. It just hasn't gone
[04:41.320 --> 04:44.340]  over the edge of the cliff yet. It's already gone off. And it's like, oh, you know where
[04:44.340 --> 04:49.920]  that's going? I mean, just get ready, strap yourselves in because the country has gone
[04:49.920 --> 04:52.560]  collectively insane like every other culture has.
[04:52.560 --> 04:56.720]  And I believe it's going to get 10 times worse before it gets better. It is going to just
[04:56.720 --> 05:05.800]  absolutely go into Bonkerville. If you want an American company with American products

[07:13.880 --> 07:19.240]  globally as one of the most impressive police states on earth. This film conclusively proves

[07:24.400 --> 07:28.560]  documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all
[07:28.560 --> 07:33.480]  powerful shadow state. Police state four chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic
[07:33.480 --> 07:39.520]  has fallen. Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship, body scammers,

[08:21.120 --> 08:27.720]  through Friday, we are here live. Ladies and gentlemen, 12 noon at three p.m. Eastern.
[08:27.720 --> 08:32.240]  And of course, we also have the Sunday show four to six p.m. and info wars nightly news
[08:32.240 --> 08:39.440]  every evening at seven o'clock Central Standard Time transmitted out to all the subscribers
[08:39.440 --> 08:43.840]  at prison planet dot TV and info wars news dot com.
[08:43.840 --> 08:50.960]  OK, wow. Another over the top, insane amount of news. I've got today's economic bombshell
[08:50.960 --> 08:56.480]  news, dovetailing with the news from yesterday about inflation worldwide ticking up very,
[08:56.480 --> 09:04.000]  very quickly because of countries all in a race to devalue their their currencies. This
[09:04.000 --> 09:07.840]  is being globally orchestrated and the G20 admits it.
[09:07.840 --> 09:14.760]  Davos is admitted and it only helps a select group of insiders in the monopoly crime syndicate.
[09:14.760 --> 09:19.120]  We're going to be getting into that. We have Dr. Corey Gold coming on. He's a talk show
[09:19.120 --> 09:26.400]  host, one on two of our affiliates out in California, KSCO and one other. And he actually
[09:26.400 --> 09:30.940]  lives in the area of Big Bear and he's actually been going there and talking to other witnesses
[09:30.940 --> 09:31.940]  and people.
[09:31.940 --> 09:38.460]  And he's going to be able to give us a report on that coming up in about one hour. Joseph
[09:38.460 --> 09:44.440]  Farah of World Net Daily, WND.com will be joining us because, let me tell you, when
[09:44.440 --> 09:49.060]  he got on air before the election, instead of Obama gets in total hammer down, they will
[09:49.060 --> 09:50.240]  confiscate the guns.
[09:50.240 --> 09:56.240]  They will start a civil war. They will try to arrest us. I was like, okay, Joe. Yeah,
[09:56.240 --> 10:00.960]  that is a possibility. Sure, it's going that direction, but I'm still thinking he was being
[10:00.960 --> 10:09.540]  a little apocalyptic. He is dead on and he's in DC. He's got his ear right to the ground.
[10:09.540 --> 10:14.840]  He knows what is afoot. So Joseph Farah will be joining us to talk about what's going on
[10:14.840 --> 10:21.760]  in Bonkerville, Cuckoo, Cocoa Puffville, crazy land that the United States is becoming.
[10:21.760 --> 10:26.440]  But it's not just here. All over the world, Western governments are just disconnected
[10:26.440 --> 10:30.720]  and getting more and more decadent and thinking everybody's believing their propaganda. Now,
[10:30.720 --> 10:34.440]  I'm going to get to this later in the hour.
[10:34.440 --> 10:39.560]  But obviously, you've seen the FBI on TV saying, they don't mean burn it down when they say
[10:39.560 --> 10:45.520]  burn that house down. But burn that house down. Burn down that cabin. Burn it down.
[10:45.520 --> 10:50.920]  Get the gas, bring it in. Okay, set the burners. Okay, the fire is set. Okay, it's on fire.
[10:50.920 --> 10:58.200]  I mean, now I've got like five clips, different clips of them talking about burn that house
[10:58.200 --> 11:03.200]  down. And the news is like burn that house down does not mean burn that house down.
[11:03.200 --> 11:08.180]  And it's just entering a whole new zone of they're so undisciplined. If you're gonna
[11:08.180 --> 11:13.240]  burn the guy up cuz he's already killed four people and injured two others and just killed
[11:13.240 --> 11:16.840]  a sheriff's deputy and you don't want him to get out alive, you don't want to have more
[11:16.840 --> 11:19.080]  people die getting in there.
[11:19.080 --> 11:24.080]  In the past, they burned the guy up, that's standard procedure. But the sheep-like public's
[11:24.080 --> 11:29.960]  not supposed to know that at Waco and everywhere else, Gordon Call case, so many others, they
[11:29.960 --> 11:36.960]  burn you up. They don't go in when you're in there. They burn you up. This is the tactics.
[11:36.960 --> 11:40.760]  And I guess as they try to confiscate guns more and more nationwide, I've got that big
[11:40.760 --> 11:47.200]  stack of news. We're just gonna see houses burned up and he burned himself up or we don't
[11:47.200 --> 11:48.200]  know why it burned up.
[11:48.200 --> 11:52.560]  And you can even have the cops in the future pouring the gasoline on the house. In the
[11:52.560 --> 11:57.120]  case of Randy Weaver, it was caught on film, it's on YouTube. Just type in chopper tries
[11:57.120 --> 12:02.800]  to burn out Randy Weaver. It has the big bladder, that's what they call it, a big bucket with
[12:02.800 --> 12:07.360]  another rope going up that they just pull and it releases gasoline on the top of your
[12:07.360 --> 12:08.360]  house.
[12:08.360 --> 12:12.400]  Then they fire a flare into it. You got guys hanging out the helicopter with a flare and
[12:12.400 --> 12:16.520]  they've got the bladder and they're gonna burn his house down with the little kids inside
[12:16.520 --> 12:21.160]  of it. You're gonna stand up to us? We shot your kid in the back and then shot your wife
[12:21.160 --> 12:22.160]  in the head.
[12:22.160 --> 12:29.880]  And now you're hiding out inside, so we're gonna shoot you cuz we're such men. Lon Horiuchi,
[12:29.880 --> 12:36.280]  the ATF sniper, yes. And because the news didn't follow orders to pull out, they got
[12:36.280 --> 12:38.480]  it on tape and they couldn't burn him out.
[12:38.480 --> 12:45.400]  But this is getting crazy now in this country where you could have them burning it down,
[12:45.400 --> 12:50.280]  lighting the match, doing it. You see them with the match and the gasoline, but that
[12:50.280 --> 12:55.260]  is not what that looks like. Now, well, okay, these are not the droids we're looking for.
[12:55.260 --> 12:57.200]  Move along, move along.
[12:57.200 --> 13:02.200]  This is what we're talking about, and we're gonna be getting into all of that. Also, CNN
[13:02.200 --> 13:09.800]  panel says Dorner's alleged murder spree is exciting, like Denzel Washington movie. And
[13:09.800 --> 13:14.940]  I've seen this on infoawards.com, on prisonplanet.com, there's a minority of people in there.
[13:14.940 --> 13:19.960]  On YouTube, it's about half the people are like, how dare you, you establishment shill,
[13:19.960 --> 13:25.400]  you are scum, you have sold out, kill pigs and more pigs. Kill, kill, kill, let's burn
[13:25.400 --> 13:30.240]  them out. Let's kill them, kill their families, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill. It's all
[13:30.240 --> 13:35.040]  over Facebook, all over Twitter, CBS News reported on it three days ago like, it's kind
[13:35.040 --> 13:36.040]  of reasonable.
[13:36.040 --> 13:43.480]  The police are corrupt and they're racist, so let's kill them. And it just adds to the
[13:43.480 --> 13:48.020]  twilight zone. You've got the cops shooting innocent people in cars that don't even match
[13:48.020 --> 13:53.640]  the description and arrogant and delusional and disconnected from reality. And then you've
[13:53.640 --> 13:58.280]  got people that think the sense of justice against this haywire system is let's kill
[13:58.280 --> 13:59.440]  cops' families.
[13:59.440 --> 14:05.280]  That's a really good idea, beyond even what the immoral police are doing. I mean, this
[14:05.280 --> 14:11.200]  is a country that is demon possessed. And see, folks are always like, well, which side
[14:11.200 --> 14:15.440]  do you take? Are you for this government or that government, this religion or that religion,
[14:15.440 --> 14:20.620]  this sect or that sect? Look, more often than not, it's that it's all bad. And it's different
[14:20.620 --> 14:24.840]  variants of it. The reason the police are dangerous is more and more they're militarized,
[14:24.840 --> 14:28.080]  more and more they're paranoid, more and more they're arrogant, and more and more they're
[14:28.080 --> 14:29.080]  trained.
[14:29.080 --> 14:31.480]  When they wanna search your car and you go, well, Fourth Amendment officer, what's your
[14:31.480 --> 14:37.020]  probable cause? Get out of here, you extremist, I've heard of that. That if you're a real
[14:37.020 --> 14:42.720]  American sensible, know what the country's founded on, know your rights, you're the enemy.
[14:42.720 --> 14:48.240]  And the system is maneuvering us into a confrontation with the police that is designed to cause
[14:48.240 --> 14:52.840]  a civil war in this country, that they're gonna try to trigger ahead of the economic
[14:52.840 --> 14:53.840]  collapse.
[14:53.840 --> 14:57.160]  So they don't get blamed for the economic collapse, of course, they know they've already
[14:57.160 --> 15:02.220]  engineered to consolidate power. See, I heard a talk show last night on 90.1 as I was driving
[15:02.220 --> 15:08.840]  home about 10 at night from work. And the talk show was from Australia. It's a pretty
[15:08.840 --> 15:12.840]  good show, I've heard it before, but it's aired local. And I heard him going, I disagree
[15:12.840 --> 15:19.360]  with Alex Jones. The martial law will be because of an economic collapse, not a civil war caused
[15:19.360 --> 15:20.360]  by gun confiscation.
[15:20.360 --> 15:25.240]  Let me explain something to you again, okay? These are complex issues, but they're also
[15:25.240 --> 15:31.640]  simple at the same time. They want to trigger a civil war as a political distraction from
[15:31.640 --> 15:36.540]  the foreign robber barons destroying the economy to consolidate it and to break the public
[15:36.540 --> 15:43.280]  and make us poor as a political tool. It's in the 112 point IMF plan leaked to the BBC
[15:43.280 --> 15:46.700]  in March of 2002 that I printed a transcript of.
[15:46.700 --> 15:50.800]  And the articles in my book, Descent into Tyranny, that's available to read as an ebook
[15:50.800 --> 15:57.080]  at prisonplanet.tv and is online. And that we wrote another article on Monday about banks
[15:57.080 --> 16:02.920]  want global rioting for global civil war and civil war in the US. The next issue of the
[16:02.920 --> 16:09.280]  magazine coming out is going to cover this. It's more than one thing can go on, it's like
[16:09.280 --> 16:13.620]  in science, part of a theory can be right from one area, part of another theory can
[16:13.620 --> 16:16.200]  be correct and then unify those fields.
[16:16.200 --> 16:22.560]  The system wants a civil war, they're gonna call terrorism. The feds against the terrorists
[16:22.560 --> 16:28.320]  who are the states, libertarians, constitutionalist, conservatives, veterans, Christians, gun owners,
[16:28.320 --> 16:33.380]  born again Christians, official Homeland Security documents. Remember Janet Reno on 60 minutes
[16:33.380 --> 16:38.680]  in 1995 said, pull the clip up, we've played it before.
[16:38.680 --> 16:43.160]  Christians who believe in the second coming of Christ are cults, are cult members and
[16:43.160 --> 16:49.780]  are the greatest threat. Now where are Christians who believe in the second coming of Christ
[16:49.780 --> 16:55.900]  doing anything? They're the most law abiding, goody two shoes, neurotically good people
[16:55.900 --> 16:58.440]  out there, on record, everybody knows that.
[16:58.440 --> 17:03.280]  But we're the terrorists, ladies and gentlemen, we're the people. We're the people who work
[17:03.280 --> 17:07.580]  17 hours a day, we're the people that go to church, we're the people that pay all the
[17:07.580 --> 17:14.000]  fake taxes and bow down to the system. And we're the terror, no, no, what we are is the
[17:14.000 --> 17:19.160]  milk cow, the slave out in the barn, who they don't want getting uppity and who they want
[17:19.160 --> 17:25.760]  to be able to absolutely feed off of to the 10th power.
[17:25.760 --> 17:31.400]  So we've got that news, and we've got all the drone news, and we've got just absolutely
[17:31.400 --> 17:35.440]  insane stuff going on that we're gonna be breaking down here today. But when we come
[17:35.440 --> 17:42.260]  back, the top stories of the day, all up at infowars.com. And I'm taking this Gateway
[17:42.260 --> 17:45.200]  Pundit article from drudgereport.com.
[17:45.200 --> 17:49.920]  And the Before It's News article about Erie County, New York sheriff says he won't confiscate
[17:49.920 --> 17:54.320]  guns, and protesters vowed to disobey New York gun law. We're gonna play that video
[17:54.320 --> 17:58.640]  and audio of them in the Capitol really getting in their face. This is very exciting. They're
[17:58.640 --> 18:03.200]  refusing to turn in their guns. Washington State bill will outlaw almost all gun owners
[18:03.200 --> 18:04.680]  make them criminals.
[18:04.680 --> 18:09.380]  In Missouri, it says, part three of the bill, and this is what they say they have the votes
[18:09.380 --> 18:14.560]  to pass right now. Surrender the assault weapon or large capacity magazine to the appropriate
[18:14.560 --> 18:19.520]  law enforcement agency for destruction, subject to any specific agency regulations. And it
[18:19.520 --> 18:25.800]  just says, this gives them a blank check law where the agency, the state police of Missouri
[18:25.800 --> 18:28.320]  decide what an assault weapon is.
[18:28.320 --> 18:32.000]  It's that blank check bill like the Obama healthcare bill just says, we can do anything
[18:32.000 --> 18:38.800]  we want. Death panels, raise any taxes you want. They're now talking about new taxes
[18:38.800 --> 18:45.200]  when you go to the doctor, a fee at the doctor in Obamacare. My dad's involved in the medical
[18:45.200 --> 18:50.160]  field, involved in management, and he was showing me the bills to line up with the feds.
[18:50.160 --> 18:54.560]  Like I meant to cover it last week. It's happening all over the country. The states are lining
[18:54.560 --> 19:02.960]  up with the feds to get fees on every doctor or dentist visit that goes, get this, to pay
[19:02.960 --> 19:07.520]  government employee pension funds.
[19:07.520 --> 19:15.000]  I mean, when you go to the doctor, you will pay a fee on top of things to pay for giant
[19:15.000 --> 19:21.400]  million dollar retirements. Yeah, I was reading about government employees, just like low
[19:21.400 --> 19:27.960]  level government people who are quote, security, not even federal law enforcement. Docs and
[19:27.960 --> 19:32.600]  things are getting $160,000 a year, and it's not even a degreed thing, but people with
[19:32.600 --> 19:34.760]  degrees are working at the grocery store.
[19:34.760 --> 19:41.920]  It is crazy. It is crazy. And they are just gonna jack, I saw the federal unions yesterday.
[19:41.920 --> 19:47.760]  We read the headline, Obama federal pay increase is not enough. Reminded me of the illegal
[19:47.760 --> 19:51.440]  alien who got the free government paid for a kidney in Chicago last month and said, it
[19:51.440 --> 19:57.120]  isn't enough. I want all the medication free. Yeah, but Americans don't get anything free
[19:57.120 --> 20:01.160]  except a SWAT team taking our houses. We don't pay property tax.
[20:01.160 --> 20:05.360]  Your freedoms are on the line. The second amendment is in danger. How soon before your
[20:05.360 --> 20:10.200]  freedoms are taken away, what can you not live without? What is your greatest dependency?
[20:10.200 --> 20:15.640]  Is it your guns? Is it your home? No, it's food. It all boils down to the food supply.
[20:15.640 --> 20:20.400]  Tyrannical governments control people by controlling their food supply. Don't be dependent. Be
[20:20.400 --> 20:25.120]  self-sufficient. Don't wait for the government to feed you, feed yourself. I can warn you,
[20:25.120 --> 20:30.080]  but I can't feed you. Do like Alex has done and get a supply of food from eFoods Direct.

[22:30.480 --> 22:34.680]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from
[22:34.680 --> 22:38.920]  counterfeit and carting to a private bank, having it lead back at interest, forcing taxes
[22:38.920 --> 22:43.040]  to service debt. This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing
[22:43.040 --> 22:46.320]  the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing
[22:46.320 --> 22:51.040]  army. Hi, Ted Anderson. I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.

[24:24.640 --> 24:29.800]  We don't want your guns. Nobody wants to confiscate them. We've just got bills introduced
[24:29.800 --> 24:34.840]  in all 50 states to confiscate them, have the Democratic Party leadership at every state
[24:34.840 --> 24:42.280]  promoting them. And we just banned most of your semi-autos and your magazines above ten
[24:42.280 --> 24:46.800]  rounds and police are pulling over veterans and people with no criminal records in New
[24:46.800 --> 24:52.600]  York and taking them to jail and charging them with five felonies. Oh, you got five
[24:52.600 --> 24:54.960]  magazines above ten round?
[24:54.960 --> 25:00.800]  That's five felonies. And the government's saying good, good gun owners. We got video
[25:00.800 --> 25:06.440]  that's coming up at the State House at their little Bloomberg run program. He's the guy
[25:06.440 --> 25:11.240]  that set it all up, put his money into it. The Safe Streets Act and the Mayors Against
[25:11.240 --> 25:15.680]  Violence, they're in Albany. This video's coming up in audio for radio listeners. It's
[25:15.680 --> 25:17.680]  powerful audio.
[25:17.680 --> 25:21.680]  And the folks that shot it put Rolling Stones to it so people will say, don't play music
[25:21.680 --> 25:26.480]  under it, we wanna hear it. It's the only video we got, so I'm gonna play it. And the
[25:26.480 --> 25:30.160]  government, if you listen to him carefully, he's like, good. They're like, we're not turning
[25:30.160 --> 25:31.160]  our guns.
[25:31.160 --> 25:34.600]  And the government's like, we're coming then, cuz it's the government owners. They see those
[25:34.600 --> 25:39.280]  people, they know their law about it, they know they're good, and they're not. And they're
[25:39.280 --> 25:45.780]  like, our food is saying it's not gonna be our slave anymore. Our property, our slaves
[25:45.780 --> 25:52.540]  are saying that they're not gonna turn firearms in. See, they already see you as slaves.
[25:52.540 --> 25:56.320]  That's the arrogance of government. They've said the message is government be arrogant,
[25:56.320 --> 26:03.580]  be in their face, flaunt things, lie to them publicly, doesn't matter how arrogant it is.
[26:03.580 --> 26:07.860]  They are a foreign military power. The globalists have taken America over. The hundreds and
[26:07.860 --> 26:11.920]  hundreds of sheriffs that have stepped up and said, this is unconstitutional from New
[26:11.920 --> 26:20.240]  York to Kentucky, from Texas, to Alabama, to Florida, to California, to Michigan, to
[26:20.240 --> 26:22.240]  Washington state.
[26:22.240 --> 26:27.640]  The hundreds, it's over 200 now. They're just simply being loyal to the republic. They're
[26:27.640 --> 26:35.760]  not collaborators with the globalists, and those aren't words. Guys, will you print me
[26:35.760 --> 26:41.200]  the history of French collaborators, the Vici French? Print me the encyclopedia, please,
[26:41.200 --> 26:42.880]  on Vici French collaborators.
[26:42.880 --> 26:46.880]  I mean, I know their definition, but I wanna read it to people so they understand it. This
[26:46.880 --> 26:51.080]  has been done when the Soviets used to take over. All those, was it 15 or so countries
[26:51.080 --> 26:56.000]  they ended up taking over with the Soviet Union? They would come in, usually not invade.
[26:56.000 --> 26:58.720]  They would put their political group in, have them take over.
[26:58.720 --> 27:02.680]  And then when the public tried to throw them out, they would then roll in Soviet tanks
[27:02.680 --> 27:10.740]  to back them up. Or the Soviets would start a civil war and claim that some group was
[27:10.740 --> 27:14.160]  being abused, so they had to invade. That's the tactics you see in the Middle East now,
[27:14.160 --> 27:16.520]  claiming Libya did something, Syria did something.
[27:16.520 --> 27:20.880]  So the good guys have to be invade backed by the West. And the good guys, as General
[27:20.880 --> 27:25.680]  Boykin, former head of Special Forces, has gone public, is Al-Qaeda. General Boykin's
[27:25.680 --> 27:30.480]  pointing out that our government's funding Al-Qaeda. And I know I've been saying that
[27:30.480 --> 27:35.880]  for years, but now General Boykin's saying, you see, you either wake up to how much trouble
[27:35.880 --> 27:42.340]  we're in or we lose everything. And the system is promoting, via Homeland Security, people
[27:42.340 --> 27:45.900]  that will do what they're told and enjoy lying to positions of power.
[27:45.900 --> 27:50.300]  And I just wanna tell everybody, this is all up at infowars.com right now. Missouri Democrats
[27:50.300 --> 27:57.700]  introduced legislation to confiscate firearms, gives gun owners 90 days to turn in weapons.
[27:57.700 --> 28:02.140]  This is officially posted by the Democratic Party of Missouri. Now again, when you call
[28:02.140 --> 28:07.020]  and say you don't want this, they're gonna say, doesn't exist. Because you're like, well,
[28:07.020 --> 28:09.980]  it's a military tactic.
[28:09.980 --> 28:13.380]  At Waco, when they're ramming the tanks in and setting it on fire, they were broadcasting,
[28:13.380 --> 28:15.900]  this is not an assault, come out with your hands up. They come out with their hands up
[28:15.900 --> 28:28.860]  on flare, they shoot them. It's the same thing, we're not taking your guns. Here's Morgan,
[28:28.860 --> 28:32.420]  I believe in the Second Amendment, even though previously he said he didn't.
[28:32.420 --> 28:36.880]  I believe you have a right to own guns, properly controlled, locked up at a shooting range.
[28:36.880 --> 28:43.020]  You can go shoot at a couple times a year. With cops on the range standing over you,
[28:43.020 --> 28:46.460]  hen packing you the whole time. He believes you have that right. They already took all
[28:46.460 --> 28:52.540]  the full auto, semi-auto. Now they want the bolt action and the single shot, all guns
[28:52.540 --> 28:53.540]  taken in Australia.
[28:53.540 --> 28:59.100]  It's been done everywhere else the exact same way over and over and over again. And they're
[28:59.100 --> 29:02.460]  in a rush to get this done because they're going to implode everything and they wanna
[29:02.460 --> 29:07.380]  start a civil war over the gun confiscation. They're gonna keep arresting veterans in these
[29:07.380 --> 29:09.020]  states where they've banned the guns.
[29:09.020 --> 29:12.700]  They're gonna keep arresting people for their magazines until people fight back and they're
[29:12.700 --> 29:16.640]  going to be called terrorists on the news. And they're then going to start trying to
[29:16.640 --> 29:22.340]  come and arrest patriots and talk show hosting people, hoping folks start fighting them,
[29:22.340 --> 29:25.220]  giving us no other choice.
[29:25.220 --> 29:30.580]  So the civil war will be the reason for the total collapse, you see. They wanna blame
[29:30.580 --> 29:36.220]  internal groups and then the feds will reorganize and declare an emergency and they'll fix things.
[29:36.220 --> 29:44.180]  Well, man, Obama really took over like Lincoln. You can see the whole scripted deal. But we're
[29:44.180 --> 29:47.980]  here blowing the whistle on it. We may be able to stop them. We'll be right back with
[29:47.980 --> 29:49.900]  the gun confiscation plan.

[33:07.140 --> 33:37.020]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[33:37.020 --> 33:41.860]  All right, we have coming up Dr. Corey Gold joining us, the Joseph Farah. Towards the
[33:41.860 --> 33:44.580]  end of the third hour, I'm gonna play a bunch of clips from the State of the Union. I got
[33:44.580 --> 33:48.700]  to some of them yesterday, but not all of them. And we've got like 16 clips. I don't
[33:48.700 --> 33:52.380]  know if I can get to all of them today, but I'll play quite a few of them. Just amazing.
[33:52.380 --> 33:56.660]  The president saying, look, if you don't do cybersecurity, I'll do an executive order.
[33:56.660 --> 34:01.380]  And the cybersecurity bill, he couldn't pass. Total open surveillance without warrants,
[34:01.380 --> 34:07.380]  what they're already doing, they just want it legalized. And tracking of everything and
[34:07.380 --> 34:11.780]  the government being able to shut everything off and just absolutely the type of stuff
[34:11.780 --> 34:13.900]  that dictators would love.
[34:13.900 --> 34:17.620]  And then, if Congress won't bring in carbon taxes and shut down all the industries to
[34:17.620 --> 34:22.660]  save the earth, of course, I'll just act. And they're just getting everybody used to
[34:22.660 --> 34:26.960]  things are gonna get bad in America. I just need to be able to act. If I was a dictator,
[34:26.960 --> 34:31.620]  I could fix all this, but the Republicans won't work with me. Really, you got your Obamacare
[34:31.620 --> 34:35.780]  passed written by the insurance companies to raise taxes on basically everybody that
[34:35.780 --> 34:40.020]  gets a paycheck, the payroll taxes, and all the other taxes.
[34:40.020 --> 34:44.820]  And the economy's shutting down, all the numbers are there. And you're telling us though your
[34:44.820 --> 34:49.380]  number one thing you want is to get us jobs. I'm gonna get back into the attack on the
[34:49.380 --> 34:53.860]  Second Amendment. And then I'm gonna open the phones up too, so you can give us your
[34:53.860 --> 34:57.700]  take on all this and I'll get into Dorner as well.
[34:57.700 --> 35:03.860]  And just the new blatant lie, when we say burn down, the FBI is saying on CNN. When
[35:03.860 --> 35:09.540]  we say burn it down or burn that house down, that does not mean that. In fact, they're
[35:09.540 --> 35:14.660]  not really saying that. And we have five different clips, I'm gonna play three of them, but they're
[35:14.660 --> 35:17.660]  linked up at infoawars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[35:17.660 --> 35:22.240]  And if you're a good patriot and then not a conspiracy theorist, they didn't set that
[35:22.240 --> 35:28.180]  on fire, don't question them. In fact, if you saw police in devil outfits with gasoline
[35:28.180 --> 35:33.260]  cans, pouring it on there, lighting it on fire in red pajamas, you didn't see that.
[35:33.260 --> 35:37.980]  Doesn't matter what you see, okay? I mean, Bill Clinton didn't have sex with that woman
[35:37.980 --> 35:43.700]  Monica Lewinsky, he told the truth. That was all a lie later when it came out that he supposedly
[35:43.700 --> 35:44.700]  lied.
[35:44.700 --> 35:48.220]  No, no, no, no, Bill Clinton doesn't lie. There's no insider trading in Congress, even
[35:48.220 --> 35:53.100]  though they admit there is. There's no UN running giant child kidnapping rings, white
[35:53.100 --> 35:58.260]  slavery rings. Even though it's all admitted, it's not happening. The government is good,
[35:58.260 --> 36:02.120]  your pension funds are safe, the dollar is safe, the economy is strong.
[36:02.120 --> 36:07.700]  We left the recession four years ago, okay? I mean, the government says so. I mean, you
[36:07.700 --> 36:14.560]  know things are better now than they were four years ago. You know things are great.
[36:14.560 --> 36:19.140]  And you also know Easter bunnies are real and Santa Claus is real. Here's a little piece
[36:19.140 --> 36:25.060]  of news. Injection-free vaccination delivered live viruses without a refrigerator. Ray Kurzweil
[36:25.060 --> 36:30.180]  reports on scientist being funded by Bill Gates who developed a little vaccine system
[36:30.180 --> 36:36.460]  that's little sugar needles that punch into your skin delivering live virus.
[36:36.460 --> 36:41.260]  Nothing like that, little specialties. Those are the cancer virus type generally, that's
[36:41.260 --> 36:47.300]  your favorite. And Bill Gates, he runs programs like this in India and 65,000 kids get polio
[36:47.300 --> 36:52.700]  and a bunch of them die. It's a minor footnote. I mean, it's no big deal. It's no big deal.
[36:52.700 --> 36:58.700]  Nothing to worry about, Mr. Gopher. It's not a plastic explosive or anything. All right,
[36:58.700 --> 37:06.380]  excuse me, I'm quoting Caddyshack. It's just becoming unbelievable.
[37:06.380 --> 37:10.620]  You know Bill Gates' dad ran Planned Parenthood as a famous eugenicist. He's still alive.
[37:10.620 --> 37:13.420]  And Bill Gates is a eugenicist. He can pull the clips up saying he wants to reduce the
[37:13.420 --> 37:21.580]  world population and says vaccines are to do it. But you know what? Never mind all that.
[37:21.580 --> 37:26.380]  He says he wants to kill you, Prince Philip, Ted Turner, Prince Charles, they all say it.
[37:26.380 --> 37:33.540]  I've got new articles out where top globalists are saying fight terrorism by reducing population.
[37:33.540 --> 37:36.740]  Be like Satan saying he was gonna destroy the whole Earth and then bring peace cuz now
[37:36.740 --> 37:42.020]  there will be peace when everything's dead. I mean, it's just all entering cuckoo land.
[37:42.020 --> 37:50.820]  Well, it's not entering, it's beyond cuckoo land. Cuckoo land and beyond. Bonkerville,
[37:50.820 --> 37:56.060]  think I coined that, Bonkersville. And I laugh about it sometimes even though it's so horrific
[37:56.060 --> 38:03.260]  because it's so ridiculous when you're awake and the general public has this auto response,
[38:03.260 --> 38:13.820]  this conditioned, learned helplessness, normalcy bias, mass Stockholm syndrome, Overton window,
[38:13.820 --> 38:20.060]  cowardly crime stop, 1984.
[38:20.060 --> 38:26.420]  You guys bring me that box of Fruit Lips in there. It's in the shipping department. Because
[38:26.420 --> 38:29.940]  the guys were saying, look at this, we bought this, I meant to show it. Because now they've
[38:29.940 --> 38:35.940]  got Orwellian doublethink on it, it says one plus one equals five on the side. And it's
[38:35.940 --> 38:39.220]  not even a joke, they try to explain how it really does equal that.
[38:39.220 --> 38:45.180]  It's just like this culture of pretty soon, the freedom will be to say two plus two equals
[38:45.180 --> 38:49.700]  four. And they're just mopping up freedom of speech, mopping up, putting their control
[38:49.700 --> 38:55.860]  grids in, hiring lots of military people who, quote, wanna be heroes in the homeland and
[38:55.860 --> 39:00.060]  really believe they're fighting terrorists everywhere when they work for the terrorist.
[39:00.060 --> 39:06.220]  Federal government's gone, folks, it's openly run by the globalist. Toll-free number to
[39:06.220 --> 39:15.780]  join us, 800-259-9231. Ladies and gentlemen, here it is, the Fruit Loops Kellogg's box
[39:15.780 --> 39:21.020]  that one of the crews saw and said they had to buy it so I could show people.
[39:21.020 --> 39:25.980]  And it says Kellogg's Fruit Loops, nothing like delicious GMO, all the colored dyes you
[39:25.980 --> 39:30.020]  need, all the high fructose corn syrup you need, everything your child needs to then
[39:30.020 --> 39:35.260]  go on a sugar high and then crash and be in a bad mood. And the answer is Ritalin Prozac
[39:35.260 --> 39:36.740]  and a bunch of other drugs.
[39:36.740 --> 39:43.260]  But here you go, part of this nutritious breakfast, one plus one equals five. That's right, it
[39:43.260 --> 39:47.460]  explains it all for your kids, a little math lesson there on this side. And look, you could
[39:47.460 --> 39:51.900]  be like Toucan Sam as well. And you'd probably grow a tumor that looks like Toucan Sam's
[39:51.900 --> 39:54.740]  nose if you eat enough high fructose corn syrup.
[39:54.740 --> 39:58.660]  And the GMO that's in there, certainly those are the rats. I can actually show you rats
[39:58.660 --> 40:04.700]  that grow these giant toucan pus snouts from the GMO if you think I'm joking. Pull up GMO
[40:04.700 --> 40:07.980]  rats for people who think I'm joking. Find one that's got the big elephant nose. Hey,
[40:07.980 --> 40:13.700]  look right here, it's got vitamin D, potassium, protein, fiber, and calcium.
[40:13.700 --> 40:18.740]  And all the dyes you need and the GMO you need plus the eight ounces of milk equals
[40:18.740 --> 40:22.760]  one plus one equals five. Of course, they don't tell you the milk's actually giving
[40:22.760 --> 40:28.380]  you all the nutrients basically. You add the Froot Loops, you will go Froot Loops. Again,
[40:28.380 --> 40:32.060]  your kid will be a screwed up sugar high person not getting the minerals and vitamins they
[40:32.060 --> 40:33.140]  need.
[40:33.140 --> 40:36.980]  And then they'll have behavioral problems and they'll jack them up on drugs and stuff
[40:36.980 --> 40:44.580]  through the new freedom initiative and then they will be as insane as Toucan Sam. All
[40:44.580 --> 40:49.500]  right, actually, I'm a conspiracy theorist, GMO is good for you. And they didn't burn
[40:49.500 --> 40:54.660]  down that cabin and they really did do the bin Laden raid.
[40:54.660 --> 40:59.060]  It's real, it's real folks, it's all real. No one on the ship saw the body and that's
[40:59.060 --> 41:02.460]  now confirmed and they fired most people on the ship, set them up so they'd be discredited.
[41:02.460 --> 41:06.580]  And the Navy SEALs helicopter blew up that day and then the others who were speaking
[41:06.580 --> 41:10.020]  out their helicopter all blew up and they think someone put a bomb on board. I've talked
[41:10.020 --> 41:12.780]  to one of the Navy SEALs whose friend died.
[41:12.780 --> 41:17.740]  But they think Al Qaeda put a bomb on the helicopter and that someone in the Pentagon
[41:17.740 --> 41:22.820]  works with Al Qaeda and had them all cram onto a helicopter for a fake mission saving
[41:22.820 --> 41:26.380]  people. Turned out it was all fake and they thought something was going on cuz they never
[41:26.380 --> 41:31.380]  done an operation like that and the helicopter blew up but the Navy SEALs think Al Qaeda
[41:31.380 --> 41:39.260]  did it. Yeah, I remember those headlines back from 9-11, top FBI agents think Al Qaeda had
[41:39.260 --> 41:43.780]  a mole in the Justice Department because Al Qaeda was always one step ahead of them.
[41:43.780 --> 41:50.380]  Yeah, they got a mole inside, the globalists run the FBI and run the CIA and run Al Qaeda.
[41:50.380 --> 41:54.280]  You're compartmentalized, you haven't figured that out yet? It's full spectrum dominance.
[41:54.280 --> 41:58.460]  If you've got this multi trillion global empire op, you've got to have an excuse to invade
[41:58.460 --> 42:03.220]  so you train and equip the groups that you then go fight. And only the commanders of
[42:03.220 --> 42:05.980]  Al Qaeda know they're double and triple agents.
[42:05.980 --> 42:10.700]  They're double agents working for the globalist and then they also are working for their own
[42:10.700 --> 42:16.420]  people and themselves. Triple agents, mercenary agents, but you don't have a full spectrum
[42:16.420 --> 42:20.380]  brain because you weren't taught to have one. You were taught to have a one dimensional,
[42:20.380 --> 42:24.340]  not even a two dimensional, not a three dimensional, certainly not a fourth or fifth dimensional
[42:24.340 --> 42:28.620]  awareness system. And that is why you are slaves.
[42:28.620 --> 42:32.380]  And I'm here to tell you folks, you can all break out of it if you learn how to study
[42:32.380 --> 42:38.020]  this stuff. Okay, I got so much I gotta get to. Let's start getting to these clips. Again,
[42:38.020 --> 42:43.820]  I'm gonna get more into this with Joseph Farah when he comes on. Missouri introduced his
[42:43.820 --> 42:49.200]  legislation to make you turn your guns in. Up at infoawards.com and drudgereport.com
[42:49.200 --> 42:51.500]  also was originally posted the Gateway Pundit article.
[42:51.500 --> 42:57.180]  I've got an MO boiling it down with a whole list of states doing similar things. Washington,
[42:57.180 --> 43:04.980]  California, Washington State bill would make almost all gun owners criminals. And California
[43:04.980 --> 43:11.660]  now, the police run checkpoints. We've probably posted 20 articles last two weeks, where you
[43:11.660 --> 43:17.260]  drive up on major roads and they go, we're just doing a safety search of the vehicle.
[43:17.260 --> 43:21.660]  But those who say it like that, it's all right. Violates the Fourth Amendment, Fifth Amendment,
[43:21.660 --> 43:27.020]  federally funded Tenth Amendment, and people with no criminal records. Remember, you're
[43:27.020 --> 43:29.380]  the remain target, you're the food.
[43:29.380 --> 43:35.140]  You're gonna make the good prisoners at the factories prisons. The new prisons are for
[43:35.140 --> 43:39.180]  the gun owners. And we're like, all right, get out of the vehicle, I'm gonna search it.
[43:39.180 --> 43:44.580]  The veteran, highly decorated one case, runs a big charity for veterans that hurt. Later
[43:44.580 --> 43:48.420]  when he's arrested, he's like, well, I run a veterans group, I have no criminal record,
[43:48.420 --> 43:49.420]  I'm highly decorated.
[43:49.420 --> 43:54.340]  They're like, buddy, you're who we want in jail, okay? I mean, you understand, you're
[43:54.340 --> 43:58.220]  the food, you're the enemy, you're done, you've helped build the empire, we're spiking you
[43:58.220 --> 44:03.900]  like that cannon. They want all the guns spiked in Missouri? You gotta spike them, fill them,
[44:03.900 --> 44:10.140]  ruin them, go in and show them, so it's worthless, this is on record, or you turn them in.
[44:10.140 --> 44:14.660]  And the troops, you're a weapon, you're to be spiked. They're gonna take your rights,
[44:14.660 --> 44:17.740]  they're gonna declare you mentally ill, they're gonna take everything you've got until you
[44:17.740 --> 44:19.940]  say you're crooks, we don't buy what you do.
[44:19.940 --> 44:24.940]  You're crooks, we know you're crooks, we know the government is illegitimate. If we don't
[44:24.940 --> 44:30.080]  start doing that, there's no future, ladies and gentlemen, okay? You've got to get out
[44:30.080 --> 44:36.900]  of your trance. So we're gonna get more into that. And they illegally search the vehicles
[44:36.900 --> 44:43.340]  and go, what is this? You got five 30 round mags, well, I didn't even know that law gone
[44:43.340 --> 44:44.340]  to effect yet.
[44:44.340 --> 44:47.060]  I gotta turn those in, those are illegal. Don't even say what you do with them, just
[44:47.060 --> 44:51.180]  they're illegal, all right? Handcuffs, boom, your life's over, five felonies, and that
[44:51.180 --> 44:57.220]  jury will sit there and salute and go, 20 years in prison, yeah, just yeah. And when
[44:57.220 --> 45:01.180]  their house gets taken cuz the property taxes, their neighbors will be good, take that house.
[45:01.180 --> 45:06.420]  Just destroy America, ruin everything, shut the power plants down, raise the taxes, bankrupt
[45:06.420 --> 45:11.620]  everything. Yeah, raise taxes on the poor and say you didn't, and the poor will beg
[45:11.620 --> 45:13.220]  you to take all their paychecks.
[45:13.220 --> 45:26.580]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, more, I mean, it is just over the top. Holy Toledo, I mean, just Calgon,
[45:26.580 --> 45:40.020]  take me away, I mean, it's just, and I'm the crazy one. I'm just gonna let this speak for
[45:40.020 --> 45:47.220]  itself. This is a CNN panel, this is up at infowars.com, Dorner's alleged murder spree
[45:47.220 --> 45:49.540]  exciting like Denzel Washington movie.
[45:49.540 --> 45:53.620]  And it's a long clip, the guy before that says you can go watch it, Breitbart broke
[45:53.620 --> 45:57.380]  it. Well, I guess they broke it on CNN, they're proud of it, I don't think they hid it. He's
[45:57.380 --> 46:01.140]  like, well, there's a lot of corrupt cops, people like this. Yeah, let's tie up people
[46:01.140 --> 46:04.780]  at cabins for two days, no food or water.
[46:04.780 --> 46:09.660]  Let's shoot cops, daughters, people are like, yeah, kill their family. I mean, just this
[46:09.660 --> 46:16.620]  country, folks, the Germans were much more moral, and I've studied it, than we are today
[46:16.620 --> 46:20.780]  in the 30s, deceived by Hitler and all the rest of it, and didn't even believe there
[46:20.780 --> 46:26.140]  were death camps everywhere. People thought the Germans were being naive, they were hyper
[46:26.140 --> 46:27.340]  naive.
[46:27.340 --> 46:30.660]  Eisenhower didn't believe they were really naive and would make him go look at stuff
[46:30.660 --> 46:37.580]  and they didn't believe it. There's famous film footage of that, and now I realize, folks,
[46:37.580 --> 46:44.860]  people are so cowardly, they would cheer, blowing babies brains out 110%. If they thought
[46:44.860 --> 46:47.660]  it would keep them from having their brains blown out, they don't get the fact that you
[46:47.660 --> 46:52.340]  stand up to tyranny or you get your brains blown out. You stand up or you become a slave.
[46:52.340 --> 46:58.980]  They think, literally, greasing the skids for tyranny, begging for it, begging for tyranny,
[46:58.980 --> 47:02.980]  that the tyranny is gonna be nice to them. You know when freedom fails, the best men
[47:02.980 --> 47:08.100]  rot in filthy jails and those that cried, appease, appeased, are hung by those they
[47:08.100 --> 47:09.100]  tried to please.
[47:09.100 --> 47:14.580]  I mean, this country, and I love America, it's a lot of great people, but it's either
[47:14.580 --> 47:19.100]  totally demonic or really hardcore getting better and more closer to God than waking
[47:19.100 --> 47:20.100]  up.
[47:20.100 --> 47:30.380]  The traffic, the boss, the baby, the dog, that does it. Calgon, take me away.
[47:30.380 --> 47:36.500]  Lose your cares in the luxury of a Calgon bath. Calgon softens the water to leave skin
[47:36.500 --> 47:43.220]  feeling silky smooth as it lifts your spirits. The soft, luxurious, fragrant world of Calgon.
[47:43.220 --> 47:47.820]  I love it. I love the fluoride water in Prozac.
[47:47.820 --> 47:54.420]  Anyways, getting back to what I was saying. Let me just get back to what I was saying
[47:54.420 --> 48:02.460]  here. The people that aren't waking up are just getting deeper and deeper into craziness.
[48:02.460 --> 48:07.820]  Countries go collectively insane. The world is going collectively insane right now. And
[48:07.820 --> 48:11.620]  we've had such wealth and everything for so long, we've become totally decadent.
[48:11.620 --> 48:18.980]  Now let's go to the CNN panel. This individual glamorizing, well, let's play the clip. Here
[48:18.980 --> 48:19.980]  it is.
[48:19.980 --> 48:23.020]  There's no waste here, though. I mean, this has been an important public conversation
[48:23.020 --> 48:28.060]  that we've had about police brutality, about police corruption, about state violence. And
[48:28.060 --> 48:31.860]  they were even talking about making him the first domestic drone target. I mean, this
[48:31.860 --> 48:32.860]  is serious business here.
[48:32.860 --> 48:36.140]  I don't think it's been a waste of time at all. And as far as Dorner himself goes, he's
[48:36.140 --> 48:40.500]  been like a real life superhero to many people. Now don't get me wrong, what he did was awful
[48:40.500 --> 48:44.820]  killing innocent people is bad. But when you read his manifesto, when you read the message
[48:44.820 --> 48:47.020]  that he left, he wasn't entirely crazy.
[48:47.020 --> 48:50.460]  He had a plan and a mission here. And many people aren't rooting for him to kill innocent
[48:50.460 --> 48:55.220]  people. They're rooting for somebody who was wronged to get a kind of revenge against the
[48:55.220 --> 48:59.060]  system. It's almost like watching Django Unchained in real life. It's kind of exciting.
[48:59.060 --> 49:03.580]  Yeah, that's enough. And when there were a whole bunch of machete attacks that I predicted,
[49:03.580 --> 49:08.060]  they were only a little local things like man killed machete, man hacked up outside
[49:08.060 --> 49:12.300]  movie theater. It was like six or seven cases, but I was right about machete causing that.
[49:12.300 --> 49:16.300]  But the media didn't report on it, so I'm wrong. And same thing with Django and all
[49:16.300 --> 49:17.300]  this stuff.
[49:17.300 --> 49:22.480]  And it's meant, again, divide and conquer in this country. And it makes me so incredibly
[49:22.480 --> 49:27.020]  frustrated that we're all being nailed to the wall by the globalists. And they're trying
[49:27.020 --> 49:33.400]  to play us off against each other, but also making the perception of anything from a liberal
[49:33.400 --> 49:35.060]  perspective than violence is okay.
[49:35.060 --> 49:39.140]  Cuz he liked Obama, he was for gun control, so it's okay. By the way, I've analyzed what
[49:39.140 --> 49:45.580]  this guy did. He didn't have actually that much training and didn't do a very good job.
[49:45.580 --> 49:53.520]  And they're now admitting that of evading and all the rest of this stuff. By the way,
[49:53.520 --> 49:58.680]  if anybody with real training ever wanted to kill police, it's pretty easy to do.
[49:58.680 --> 50:04.100]  You go to the police station and you wait till there's a shift change. And I'm not letting
[50:04.100 --> 50:10.140]  out any secrets here that real people trained in this type of stuff would not already know,
[50:10.140 --> 50:11.140]  okay?
[50:11.140 --> 50:17.700]  I mean, if Dorner wanted to kill 50 cops, there's a way to do it. And again, the point
[50:17.700 --> 50:25.940]  is that he was a anti-gun buffoon. And I believe from the research, this was a real case, at
[50:25.940 --> 50:30.700]  least part of it. The way the police acted hysterical, pity partying, shooting innocent
[50:30.700 --> 50:36.700]  people, it was a PR disaster for them. But they did find IDs on the Mexican border and
[50:36.700 --> 50:42.360]  up at the house. But they're such congenital liars, you don't know if any of that's true.
[50:42.360 --> 50:48.780]  So maybe he was an innocent guy. I mean, who knows? Maybe he's like Django, I mean, a hero.
[50:48.780 --> 50:54.540]  I mean, everybody knows Django kills the, what is it, Japanese police captain's daughter.
[50:54.540 --> 51:00.780]  I mean, that's heroic. He was racist, obviously. I mean, sarcastic. We'll be right back.

[54:20.600 --> 54:31.080]  million bullets in FEMA camps, highway checkpoints, but open borders. We'll die for the system.
[54:31.080 --> 54:39.960]  Little piece of me, little piece of you. Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. I know we got
[54:39.960 --> 54:43.920]  callers and we got a guest coming up, but I haven't even gotten to the sheriff's department
[54:43.920 --> 54:49.160]  when the sheriff there in the Big Bear area when he says that we didn't usually set the
[54:49.160 --> 54:53.320]  fire. He like totally looks down. I mean, it's like when your kid like, did you open
[54:53.320 --> 54:56.300]  the whole package of cookies and eat all 20 of them?
[54:56.300 --> 55:01.480]  They got cookies all over their face. No, I didn't. They looked down. He looks down.
[55:01.480 --> 55:06.360]  We did not burn it on purpose. No. And when Bill Clinton didn't have sex with that lady
[55:06.360 --> 55:13.400]  and Obama loves poor people too. Yeah. Yeah. He's a nice man. Let's go ahead and play the
[55:13.400 --> 55:18.040]  sheriff last night saying, because he's asked by the mumbling reporter, he can't really
[55:18.040 --> 55:21.560]  hear it. You know, did you guys initially set the fire? Here it is.
[55:21.560 --> 55:26.080]  I can tell you that it was not on purpose. We did not intentionally burn down that cabin
[55:26.080 --> 55:33.660]  to get Mr. Dorner out. The tear gas canisters that we used. First off, we used a presence
[55:33.660 --> 55:39.620]  when we showed up. Secondly, we used a cold tear gas. Then we used sec. The next tier
[55:39.620 --> 55:48.020]  gas was that that was pyrotechnic does generate a lot of heat. We had introduced those canisters
[55:48.020 --> 55:52.520]  into the residents and a fire erupted along with the gasoline. Right. Because I know you're
[55:52.520 --> 55:54.800]  following special forces tactics.
[55:54.800 --> 56:02.240]  That's enough from him. That's enough from him. Standard procedure. Dump fuel, fire,
[56:02.240 --> 56:06.280]  incendiary. If you're in an open military zone, you see is a flamethrower, incinerated
[56:06.280 --> 56:11.880]  weapons bombs. But if it's public, oh, dump the fuel, then use a burner, then say it's
[56:11.880 --> 56:14.760]  a fire. Now let's go to some of these clips. I don't have time to play them on, so we'll
[56:14.760 --> 56:18.820]  get a few of your calls and the guests coming up. But let's go ahead and play just randomly
[56:18.820 --> 56:19.820]  guys.
[56:19.820 --> 56:42.520]  You got so many clips. Here's one. All right, again, we apologize for the expletive. That's
[56:42.520 --> 57:11.720]  get the gas. Burn it down. I don't know. And again, the unbaped version is on info
[57:11.720 --> 57:16.760]  wars dot com. All right, we're going to go. We're going to go forward with the plan with
[57:16.760 --> 57:18.760]  the with the burner.
[57:18.760 --> 57:38.440]  Like we talked about. We have a fire. We were in charge. We're killing him. We're in charge.
[57:38.440 --> 57:44.640]  That's what it's all about. I'm in charge. I've arrived. I'm a movie star. I'm a I'm
[57:44.640 --> 57:45.640]  a government guard.
[57:45.640 --> 57:56.520]  The Ghostbusters say no and die. That's enough. The point is, is that when you hear it without
[57:56.520 --> 58:00.000]  the beach, it's even clearer. We have to beep it for radio. They're like, burn that mother
[58:00.000 --> 58:04.120]  bleep her down. Burn it down. What do you make of that?
[58:04.120 --> 58:09.240]  It could be just bravado talk. I mean, obviously, there's multiple rounds being exchanged at
[58:09.240 --> 58:15.040]  that particular time. You have an officer down, two officers down at that point. And
[58:15.040 --> 58:19.840]  stop right there. That's good. I want to play it earlier because the CNN after a day after
[58:19.840 --> 58:24.400]  we broke it and drugs report pushed it out there, then they were forced to OK.
[58:24.400 --> 58:27.520]  They're saying burn that mother ever down. They play it and they have the original clear
[58:27.520 --> 58:33.160]  footage because what we have a shot of a television by a listener and they play it. It's very
[58:33.160 --> 58:37.480]  clear. Well, that's just bravado saying burn that house down. But others say it doesn't
[58:37.480 --> 58:40.480]  mean burn the house down.
[58:40.480 --> 58:51.080]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.

[01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:25.760]  radio network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones. All right. I gave the number
[01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:30.920]  out kind of hog the time. We're gonna go to some of your calls now, and I promise we'll
[01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:34.280]  get to your calls. We're holding with Dr. Corey Goldswithers and Joseph Farris was about
[01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:37.960]  40 minutes in the next hour. And then I'm gonna get into some of the state of the union
[01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:42.960]  I didn't get into yesterday. Just it's all surreal right now. It's gotten so crazy. Let's
[01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:49.160]  go to Alex in Illinois has a death panel story. Welcome, Alex. Hey, Alex. Thanks for having
[01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:54.400]  me on the show. First of all, I just wanted to say before I got into my story, it was
[01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:59.880]  May Day, May 1st, 2011 when you woke me up. So thank you very much for that. Awesome.
[01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:05.400]  What I wanted to tell you about today is my mother. I was trying to get her to come on
[01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:11.360]  the show and tell her story, but she is a director of a cardiovascular unit in a hospital
[01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:18.240]  in Illinois. And they brought in a brand new group of doctors that they work with for heart
[01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:24.640]  attack victims and things like that. The new bioethics panel. Yeah, it's the brand new
[01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:29.040]  group of doctors they brought in right after Obamacare got brought in. There's one particular
[01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:35.200]  doctor who's almost causing my mom to lose her job because this guy is coming in and
[01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:42.680]  he let a a a 46 year old homeless guy who came in for heart treatment have a heart attack
[01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:46.680]  for 16 hours through the night because of his social status.
[01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:51.160]  He said, well, this is a 46 year old doctor than a completely different story. No, no,
[01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:55.600]  no. That's Bob. But that's liberal. And see, people don't get that they're getting rid
[01:01:55.600 --> 01:01:59.360]  of all the old doctors, basically telling them leave and the new officers are arriving.
[01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:05.880]  And these are medical officers of the socialist takeover. And they are horrible eugenicist
[01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:11.440]  environmentalists who are here to reduce population and believe in there's only so much. So Bill
[01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:16.920]  Gates says we've got to kill granny to hire 10 teachers and again, he'll end up firing
[01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:17.920]  your mother.
[01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:22.320]  So you either go on the offense against them or they will go on the offense against you.
[01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:26.960]  But no, this is going on everywhere. If they don't politically like you and you have insurance,
[01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:34.400]  they're going to kill you. They are officers now. They are in command and they enjoy the
[01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:39.040]  exercise of power. Go ahead. I'm sorry.
[01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:44.880]  That's the thing. They're loving. We should do what they say. Just like Linda Blair is
[01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:49.680]  in The Exorcist. I'm sorry. Go ahead, Alex. She's got the director of nursing, the director
[01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:55.200]  of quality care, her two direct supervisors backing her and the vice president, not of
[01:02:55.200 --> 01:03:01.000]  the hospital, but the vice president of marketing is threatening to fire her and is backing
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:07.760]  this doctor. And I told her, of course, you've got to let somebody have a heart attack and
[01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:08.760]  die.
[01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:14.760]  And of course, it's the homeless kind of day. It'll be you tomorrow. It all started this
[01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:21.600]  way in Germany. Oh, but it's liberal. It's liberal. I'm sorry. Go ahead.
[01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:26.840]  My question to you, Alex, is that she's thinking about pursuing potential legal action. Does
[01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:27.840]  she have a case with-
[01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:32.280]  Well, they'll circle the laggings just like the cops that torched Dornier. It's all about
[01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:35.280]  they're going to lie. They're going to get away with it. And each time they get away
[01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:40.480]  with more, they're going to do more. No, I mean, absolutely. I mean, the fact is they'll
[01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:43.880]  end up getting her because it's a cult and then they'll have their fun at the hospital.
[01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:48.320]  They always do. They take organs at hospitals, kill healthy people for organs. It's all over
[01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:49.320]  the country.
[01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:52.240]  I mean, it's a nightmare. I mean, my dad's a physician and warned me when I got my driver's
[01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:55.560]  license, don't sign your organ donor card. A lot of hospitals will kill you if you come
[01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:59.480]  in even hardly hurt. And then I didn't believe him. And then 60 minutes, like five years
[01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:03.800]  later, did a whole piece on it, mentioning the city where I lived. But you know what?
[01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:07.320]  Killing people for their organs is loving too. Why not just say, why shouldn't your
[01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:11.080]  mother just offer to join the cult and start killing people?
[01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:14.600]  I mean, is your mother an extremist?
[01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:16.680]  No, absolutely not. She is-
[01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:19.960]  She doesn't want to kill people. I mean, that's obviously some kind of fruitcake.
[01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:24.200]  No, this single event is causing her to wake up. And I finally started-
[01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:29.560]  No, no, your mother and you are bad people. Killing people is good.
[01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:32.640]  Well, Alex, I appreciate you allowing me on the show.
[01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:37.400]  No, no, seriously, let me just be serious with you, brother. Look, even if she threatens
[01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:40.040]  them, they don't care. They're used to always winning. They'll probably try to get rid of
[01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:42.120]  her and then blackball her and lie about her.
[01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:46.620]  The best thing is to go on the total offense, talk about everything she saw, what she did,
[01:04:46.620 --> 01:04:51.720]  the truth is the truth, call their bluff, put the whole thing out. And it's a bioethics
[01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:57.200]  death panel at that hospital. Either that or they're going to totally take over and
[01:04:57.200 --> 01:05:01.320]  start killing all of us.
[01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:05.520]  Your freedoms are on the line. The Second Amendment is in danger. How soon before your
[01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:10.360]  freedoms are taken away? What can you not live without? What is your greatest dependency?
[01:05:10.360 --> 01:05:15.840]  Is it your guns? Is it your home? No, it's food. It all boils down to the food supply.
[01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:20.580]  The radical governments control people by controlling their food supply. Don't be dependent.
[01:05:20.580 --> 01:05:25.280]  Be self-sufficient. Don't wait for the government to feed you. Feed yourself. I can warn you,
[01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:26.680]  but I can't feed you.

[01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:12.560]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:22.680]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:33.120]  All right, here are some of the latest headlines up at Infowars.com. Dorner Drones and the
[01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:37.920]  NDAA Secret Arrest Program. Kurt Nemo, Medals for Killing Women and Children. Majority of
[01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:42.640]  Americans support drone strikes. And some numbers I've seen show half the public supporting
[01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:47.720]  Dorner. They just love death and killing and to be slaves. New surveillance system tracks
[01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:53.480]  every moving object in the entire city. Gotta track the slaves. FBI mouthpiece suggests
[01:08:53.480 --> 01:08:56.680]  police were not yelling, burn it, burn it down.
[01:08:56.680 --> 01:09:00.120]  But then other police say, well, they just meant that cuz they were angry. Even though
[01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:04.120]  we have six, now what is it, six different clips of them saying burn him, kill him, burn
[01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:09.720]  him down, burn that house down. Burn that house down does not mean that. You understand
[01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:16.360]  these are not the droids you're looking for? Move along. Also, it says expert combat terrorism
[01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:18.920]  with highly drastic population control.
[01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:24.360]  And the Pentagon actually has a paper out agreeing humans are terror. The establishment
[01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:31.560]  needs everything you've got to save you, of course. Police ludicrously claim Dorner cabin
[01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:36.200]  fire was not intentional, full report there. Kill anyone you want, law has been abandoned
[01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:40.280]  in America. Mike Adams calls that satire, it's a great article, but it's not really
[01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:41.280]  satire.
[01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:45.960]  I mean, yeah, you can't cuz you're a lowly slave. Obama wants to secretly kill, put our
[01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:51.920]  troops under you in. Congress wants to insider trade. They wanna burn down Dorner and then
[01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:55.840]  lie and say they didn't. They wanna shoot innocent people in vehicles that don't even
[01:09:55.840 --> 01:10:01.760]  match his description. That's fine. Government is king, government is God, government is
[01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:02.760]  everything.
[01:10:02.760 --> 01:10:06.760]  The founding fathers are bad. FEMA actually teaches it. In my film Road to Tyranny, I
[01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:11.440]  have footage of them teaching police the founding fathers are evil. I have footage of squad
[01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:16.040]  card checkpoints where they find a pocket constitution of one of my listeners and arrest
[01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:22.440]  her and start hyperventilating like they had found just Satan himself in her trunk.
[01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:30.880]  I've gotta play that clip again sometime. This is the bizaroid weirdness that is going
[01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:38.520]  on. This is the over the top cuckoo land world we've entered. Now, Dr. Corey Gold joins us.
[01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:41.680]  We're gonna get to your calls in the second half of this hour all over the map. He can
[01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:44.120]  talk about it, fake outbreaks.
[01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:49.240]  Piers Morgan and Dorner, big supporter of him, Moron Dorner, media manipulation. He's
[01:10:49.240 --> 01:10:54.720]  a syndicated talk show host. He out of KSC, one of our great affiliates there in California.
[01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:58.560]  We're also on that station at Sister Station. And then Joseph Farah joins us a little bit
[01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:03.220]  in the next hour for about 30 minutes or so to talk about the total tyranny we're seeing.
[01:11:03.220 --> 01:11:07.980]  But he lives right down the hill from where all this happened. He's got a lot of contacts
[01:11:07.980 --> 01:11:14.680]  in the media there. So I called him and asked him to do as much research as he could on
[01:11:14.680 --> 01:11:21.400]  this and to give us a report on what's happening and what is going on in the area.
[01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:25.880]  So I'm gonna give you the floor for the balance of this segment, all the few points to throw
[01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:31.320]  in. But to break down your take on what's happening, your take on the public, many of
[01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:38.580]  them praising him, large numbers. CNN host praising him, CNN panel members, and the police
[01:11:38.580 --> 01:11:41.120]  acting like crazy people as well.
[01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:47.040]  I mean, this is out of control. And what you really think went on here, Dr. Corey Gold,
[01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:51.200]  again, received his doctorate in dental surgery from the University of California, San Francisco
[01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:55.200]  in 88. Prior to that, he received a bachelor's degree in biology. He's one of the biggest
[01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:59.780]  vitamin mineral developers, the most successful in the country, product developers, with a
[01:11:59.780 --> 01:12:04.760]  minor in chemistry from California State University, Fullerton, and received a bachelor's degree
[01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:07.360]  in dental sciences from the University of California, San Francisco.
[01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:10.880]  And he has a bunch of other medical degrees as well. I won't get into all those, but he's
[01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:17.240]  one of the major formulators of things like the products that he has, like Polymer Plus
[01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:24.360]  available, I should add, at Infowars.com or InfowarsHealth.com, but that's a side issue
[01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:25.360]  today.
[01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:28.840]  Dr. Gold, give us your report. You're there in the area, you live there. You're a syndicated
[01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:33.080]  talk show host out of California. You've got the sources, what is going on?
[01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:37.560]  Well, I'm sad to say that I was only about five miles away from the first killing of
[01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:41.640]  the Cal State Fullerton coach that was the daughter of one of the police gentlemen involved
[01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:45.640]  in this whole problem. And I've had a bird's eye view. I know most of the people here in
[01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:50.520]  the media. And if you listen to talk radio here in Southern California, in Southern California
[01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:56.380]  leans as far left as you can possibly lean. They were screaming up and down for gun control.
[01:12:56.380 --> 01:13:00.140]  They were screaming up and down for drones in the air to protect us from people like
[01:13:00.140 --> 01:13:05.160]  Christopher Dorner. They were screaming for the military to be brought in. There's one
[01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:10.560]  guy, there's one guy who's in a population of 30 million people and they were crying
[01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:17.500]  for the military to be brought onto the streets to keep us safe. It was insane over here.
[01:13:17.500 --> 01:13:23.080]  And the amount of police activity in Southern California was just intense. People were,
[01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:29.520]  they were almost like purposely keeping you, the average population nervous on purpose.
[01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:34.240]  They just send squads of cars like almost seemingly in every direction and they were
[01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:40.680]  stopping the freeways. It was almost like the entire city was being kept on hyper alert,
[01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:44.840]  like we're being invaded by Japan or China or something. And there was one guy, of course,
[01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:51.600]  he was a dangerous, crazy person loose somewhere. And what was interesting was, and I, you know,
[01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:57.360]  I saw the fire from where we live and we were watching it on TV as well. And it was happening
[01:13:57.360 --> 01:14:05.680]  right literally minutes before Barack Obama walked on to do the state of the union address.
[01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:09.440]  It was almost like the opening act for the state of the union. It was like, it could
[01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:16.600]  not have been time better. There is this crazy ex veteran, Christopher Dorner, who's killing
[01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:21.200]  people, running around as a menace. And then all of a sudden you have President Obama walk
[01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:28.400]  on to the, to the floor of the house of representatives talking about gun control and the use of drones.
[01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:32.960]  I mean, he didn't say drones in his state of the union, but we all know that he's for
[01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:37.720]  drones. He's expect, we all say that Bush is bad. I mean, Obama has expanded the use
[01:14:37.720 --> 01:14:41.200]  of drones. Like Bush was a, a piker in the use of drones.
[01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:48.240]  Dr. Gold, I got to stop you. You just convinced me this may be staged, even though the M O
[01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:54.080]  he's an Obama supporter. He's an anti gun guy. It makes the cops look bad, but the way
[01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:57.840]  it was all perfectly scripted because no one watches the state of the union anymore. It's
[01:14:57.840 --> 01:15:05.920]  a big joke. No one watches CNN, MSNBC, perfectly scripted where that happened right up to where
[01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:06.920]  Obama was on.
[01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:13.040]  So everyone would watch him. Wow. That again, it's the scripting. That's always the sign.
[01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:18.240]  What's your gut on this? You know, I think Dorner was a loose screw.
[01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:23.240]  Do I think he was manipulated? I don't know. The timing on it was, you couldn't have a
[01:15:23.240 --> 01:15:29.560]  Hollywood production that was timed any better than literally the cabin on fire. The villain
[01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:34.760]  burned to death, you know, going out, killing cops on his way out. As the president of United
[01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:38.120]  States walks on, they're telling us that he can keep us safe by putting drones in the
[01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:43.800]  air, by taking more of your tax dollar, by growing the government, by having more foreign
[01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:44.800]  wars.
[01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:48.000]  And of course, taking your guns. I mean, it was almost like, you know, like you couldn't
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:52.760]  have a Spielberg script any better.
[01:15:52.760 --> 01:15:57.940]  I'm just speechless right now. What about the police shooting up innocent people that
[01:15:57.940 --> 01:16:03.840]  didn't even match the description and now saying they didn't burn him out?
[01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:08.100]  Well about that, I think they kept the average police person such on edge. They thought every
[01:16:08.100 --> 01:16:12.880]  person in every pickup truck might have been Christopher Dorner. I don't know if those
[01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:16.200]  people did it on purpose. My guess is they were just so frightened that they started
[01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:21.520]  shooting because it's put into their head that, you know, the evil axis that had landed
[01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:26.040]  in Southern California. What he's talking about is that there were two women delivering
[01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:31.460]  newspapers and the police shot at them multiple times thinking they might be Christopher Dorner
[01:16:31.460 --> 01:16:34.760]  and they were just two women delivering newspapers in the morning and they really shot up their
[01:16:34.760 --> 01:16:39.140]  vehicle pretty bad. I don't know if that was connected or not or just, you know, police
[01:16:39.140 --> 01:16:40.640]  that were scared of what was happening.
[01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:45.120]  No, no, they did. And then there was other cases as well of this mass insanity. What
[01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:47.540]  do you think about the fire?
[01:16:47.540 --> 01:16:52.280]  My personal opinion is they burned the place down. It's not the first time we've seen the
[01:16:52.280 --> 01:16:56.500]  US government use those tactics. And it won't be the last time we've seen the US government
[01:16:56.500 --> 01:16:57.500]  use those tactics.
[01:16:57.500 --> 01:17:02.360]  Now, we talked to you yesterday. You said you were talking to locals, talking to others.
[01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:04.880]  What other tidbits do you have on this?
[01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:09.600]  Well, you know, one thing it is, is that the media out here has made Christopher Dorner
[01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:14.080]  a celebrity. And there were people rooting for Christopher Dorner because he was fighting
[01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:19.840]  back against evil police, almost once again, pitting civilians against the police, trying
[01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:21.340]  to create that divide.
[01:17:21.340 --> 01:17:26.880]  You can't trust anybody. Blacks against white, whites against Japanese, police against, you
[01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:33.160]  know, the average citizen, us against Russia, you know, the divide and conquer type of mentality.
[01:17:33.160 --> 01:17:36.840]  And people were saying that the police deserved it. It was like almost like a game show going
[01:17:36.840 --> 01:17:41.900]  on. It was like a reality show playing out in Southern California. And some people were
[01:17:41.900 --> 01:17:47.360]  sad to see it end because it was kind of like a suspenseful game.
[01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:53.200]  What is your take on Obama and all the legislation introduced to actually physically ban guns
[01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:58.320]  and make you turn them in in places like Missouri, in places like California is moving towards
[01:17:58.320 --> 01:18:04.440]  that legislation, Washington State? I mean, this is going to cause a confrontation.
[01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:10.960]  Well, yes, I think that if President Obama had his way and could get away with it, they
[01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:15.360]  would confiscate all the weapons in the United States of America. That's what I think. I
[01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:20.160]  think he's taking a stepwise approach because he knows he can't do that. So he's getting
[01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:23.900]  what he can.
[01:18:23.900 --> 01:18:29.200]  Is Obama worse than you thought he'd be? No, I actually did think this is what Barack
[01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:36.560]  Obama's administration would be like when he ran. And it's coming through to fruition
[01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:42.040]  and it's scary. It's scary. And what's worse is I don't know where we go next after Obama.
[01:18:42.040 --> 01:18:46.280]  Where's America going to turn three and a half years from now? That's just a scary thought.
[01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:51.120]  Did you see his State of the Union where he said over and over again, if Congress won't
[01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:53.280]  act, I'll just do it? I mean, whoa.
[01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:56.720]  Right. Yeah. Why do we need Congress for? In fact, we could save their salaries according
[01:18:56.720 --> 01:19:01.160]  to Barack Obama. We don't even need them. We could just do a cost cutting save right
[01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:05.500]  there. Hey, if you don't want to do what I want you to do, I'll just do it anyway. So
[01:19:05.500 --> 01:19:09.480]  you might as well go ahead. But if you don't, I'll just go ahead by fiat. I'll do some executive
[01:19:09.480 --> 01:19:13.920]  order. I'll just do it through my legislative power that I have.
[01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:18.720]  Yeah, they'll say it's a conspiracy theory that mothers ever breastfed, that water didn't
[01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:25.220]  have fluoride in it, and that you don't water your plants with Bronco, and that there was
[01:19:25.220 --> 01:19:29.000]  ever even a Congress. And I'm not even joking. They're getting to that point now where they
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:33.600]  just ball face lie to us on purpose to get us used to it.
[01:19:33.600 --> 01:19:37.160]  Well, no one trusts the government. I mean, look at the statistics right now of people
[01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:40.240]  who actually trust the US government who are US citizens. It's very low.
[01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:44.480]  Well, they're extremists. They're bad people. They should worship the government. We come
[01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:50.600]  back. I want to ask you about Dorner and people that are praising him. I mean, it's just it's
[01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:55.440]  a lot of people. People people I've run into are mad at me that I that I don't want to
[01:19:55.440 --> 01:20:01.560]  go kill people's daughters and things. It's just beyond bizarre. We'll be right back.
[01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:05.760]  Your freedoms are on the line. The Second Amendment is in danger. How soon before your
[01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:10.600]  freedoms are taken away? What can you not live without? What is your greatest dependency?
[01:20:10.600 --> 01:20:16.080]  Is it your guns? Is it your home? No, it's food. It all boils down to the food supply.
[01:20:16.080 --> 01:20:21.280]  Tyrannical governments control people by controlling their food supply. Don't be dependent. Be self
[01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:25.520]  sufficient. Don't wait for the government to feed you. Feed yourself. I can warn you,

[01:22:59.840 --> 01:23:04.600]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the bestselling book Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:10.400]  I want you to know some very important information. In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested
[01:23:10.400 --> 01:23:14.680]  that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could
[01:23:14.680 --> 01:23:20.160]  obtain this world-class healer. Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around
[01:23:20.160 --> 01:23:24.600]  the world to keep people healthy. Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in

[01:23:57.720 --> 01:23:59.440]  It's the only one you've got.
[01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:13.440]  Day after day, alone on a hill. A man with a foolish grin. A man with a foolish grin
[01:24:13.440 --> 01:24:19.440]  is keeping perfectly still. Nobody wants to listen to him. He thinks Bill Clinton's a
[01:24:19.440 --> 01:24:34.440]  person. Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here back live. Your calls are coming up. And I've
[01:24:34.440 --> 01:24:40.440]  got to air this while Dr. Gold's on with us. I'll do it in the next segment. New York State
[01:24:40.440 --> 01:24:45.440]  resistance, I mean all the big gun groups, the citizens, they're having rallies every
[01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:49.440]  couple days. They're going into the committee rooms saying, look, you're not getting our
[01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:53.440]  guns. And the government's bowing up but then getting scared. I mean, the government is
[01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:57.440]  a bunch of crooks that see us as their food. And they've already gotten us an incredible
[01:24:57.440 --> 01:25:01.440]  debt that's not our debt, most of it, and they want to clamp down. History follows this
[01:25:01.440 --> 01:25:08.440]  exact pattern. We're going to talk about that coming up with Dr. Gold as well. But I asked
[01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:11.440]  you yesterday when we talked to you, well, I told through my producer that, hey, let's
[01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:16.440]  just not get him on about the Dorner thing. I want to get into some of the news you've
[01:25:16.440 --> 01:25:20.440]  been covering in medical and health stuff. And you sent me a whole stack of stories about
[01:25:20.440 --> 01:25:25.440]  the proliferation of school lunches not being allowed first in Chicago, where the mafia
[01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:28.440]  don runs things, now proliferating all over the country.
[01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:31.440]  Where all this is going, the craziness, the drugging of the kids, we're going to get into
[01:25:31.440 --> 01:25:36.440]  some of that medical news here in a moment. But briefly in this short segment, what do
[01:25:36.440 --> 01:25:43.440]  you think about, really, because I saw it grassroots, it's real, huge support for Dorner,
[01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:49.440]  such hatred of the corrupt establishment that people would cheer on killing cops' family.
[01:25:49.440 --> 01:25:54.440]  I mean, that's even beyond what the corrupt police are doing. And it really shows this
[01:25:54.440 --> 01:25:57.440]  country's ready to blow in my view, your take on that.
[01:25:57.440 --> 01:26:02.440]  Yeah, you have to question anybody who gets any type of enjoyment or support somebody
[01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:09.440]  who kills somebody's daughter as a revenge. Somebody who would do that, I don't know where
[01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:13.440]  the mindset is. Here's a nice girl, she's a coach at Cal State Fullerton basketball
[01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:20.440]  team. Her father happens to be a police officer. And they murder her. And there's a large segment
[01:26:20.440 --> 01:26:24.440]  of the population that says, that will show him. And I can't even understand that group
[01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:29.440]  of people. And yet there was a group of people, and you could look on Facebook and Twitter,
[01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:34.440]  you could even listen on the media calling in, which were kind of rooting for him as
[01:26:34.440 --> 01:26:37.440]  the vigilante, like he was somehow representing them by-
[01:26:37.440 --> 01:26:42.440]  Oh yeah, I've been, I've never gotten this much heat probably on any issue. And it shocks
[01:26:42.440 --> 01:26:48.440]  me, because I usually see stuff coming a mile away, that I'm some type of bootlicking, cop-loving,
[01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:52.440]  I mean, a piece of garbage here. I don't like what the police are being turned into. I don't
[01:26:52.440 --> 01:26:58.440]  like where this country's going. But the lowest of the low target people's families. I mean,
[01:26:58.440 --> 01:27:03.440]  that's an old rule, don't mess with people's families. If you got a problem, come to me.
[01:27:03.440 --> 01:27:06.440]  Don't go after somebody's family.
[01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:11.440]  Yeah, and a number of radio stations, even the biggest radio station here in Southern
[01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:17.440]  California, there was a debate, or whether or not it was a racial issue going on here,
[01:27:17.440 --> 01:27:23.440]  because they were describing Christopher Dorner as a 270 pound African American person, and
[01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:26.440]  showing his picture. And there was a large number of people here in Southern California
[01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:30.440]  said, this is racial, this is racial profiling, this is stereotypical.
[01:27:30.440 --> 01:27:34.440]  Yeah, you can't even say the description of someone. So I guess it's kind of political
[01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:38.440]  correctness that they pulled over the white guy, little skinny white guy, let him go,
[01:27:38.440 --> 01:27:42.440]  then rammed his car and shot him up. Maybe that's good. Maybe to show we're not racist,
[01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:46.440]  we should have maybe 10,000 white people a day killed in California.
[01:27:46.440 --> 01:27:50.440]  Well, and what's interesting is, is he was out there saying, this is me, I'm Christopher
[01:27:50.440 --> 01:27:55.440]  Dorner, I have my 20 page manifesto, here's the reason I'm taking these actions, and his
[01:27:55.440 --> 01:28:00.440]  mind. And yet when you say, this is the person who says he's doing it, this is the person
[01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:04.440]  we have on videotape. There are people out here calling radio shows saying that was a
[01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:08.440]  racist activity, just reporting who he was, and he admits who he is.
[01:28:08.440 --> 01:28:13.440]  Meanwhile, a CNN panel member was talking about how this is great, like Django.
[01:28:13.440 --> 01:28:16.440]  Right, Django won't change.
[01:28:16.440 --> 01:28:22.440]  I mean, the system, like you said, is trying to create division at every level, and I just
[01:28:22.440 --> 01:28:25.440]  hope people wake up to this and say no to it.
[01:28:25.440 --> 01:28:30.440]  And one of the reasons I think he was so lionized is who did he support? He supported gun control,
[01:28:30.440 --> 01:28:34.440]  although he was killing people with guns. I love how when people are shooting people
[01:28:34.440 --> 01:28:38.440]  with guns and they're telling you take guns away from you. Second thing is he was supporting
[01:28:38.440 --> 01:28:43.440]  Piers Morgan, he was supporting the crazies of the crazies on the media.
[01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:47.440]  So we're now supposed to turn our attention away now that he's gone to those people to
[01:28:47.440 --> 01:28:50.440]  be our saviors, the Piers Morgan to save us all.
[01:28:50.440 --> 01:28:56.440]  Yeah, Piers Morgan, who sat on a show with Bissinger and Huntsman's daughter, they all
[01:28:56.440 --> 01:28:59.440]  agreed I should be killed and they want to kill me. And oh, that's funny, though. Can
[01:28:59.440 --> 01:29:05.440]  you imagine if you or I said kill somebody? I mean, we would be arrested within a day.
[01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:10.440]  There's a huge double standard what's going on when President Bush was in office, there
[01:29:10.440 --> 01:29:15.440]  were literally, the news were telling us every day how many people were dying in Iraq and
[01:29:15.440 --> 01:29:19.440]  in Afghanistan and around the world, and they were demonizing him.
[01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:22.440]  Today, we don't hear that yet we're having deaths of American soldiers all over the place
[01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:25.440]  because it's Obama's war now, so it's good death.
[01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:31.440]  Not a war, a peace action in Libya, Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq and Mali, and that's peace.
[01:29:31.440 --> 01:29:32.440]  Right.
[01:29:32.440 --> 01:29:38.440]  That's peace, carpet bombing areas of Tripoli and other areas. How dare you? That man deserves
[01:29:38.440 --> 01:29:44.440]  more peace prizes. I say every bomb he drops, every drone attack on a family, he should
[01:29:44.440 --> 01:29:49.440]  get another peace prize. I say with inflation, a trillion peace prizes.
[01:29:49.440 --> 01:29:56.440]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.

[01:33:02.440 --> 01:33:10.440]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over
[01:33:10.440 --> 01:33:19.440]  the mind of man. Thomas Jefferson. It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:19.440 --> 01:33:25.440]  What do you need a semi-automatic weapon for? The only reason I think you need it is Pierce,
[01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:30.440]  challenge Alex Jones to a boxing match, show up with a semi-automatic that you got legally
[01:33:30.440 --> 01:33:36.440]  and pop them. I'd love to see that. In uniform.
[01:33:36.440 --> 01:33:43.440]  Oh, yeah. She's like, ooh, Pierce, you wear the uniform when you do it. He's like, yeah,
[01:33:43.440 --> 01:33:49.440]  yeah. Can't say how many times I've been in a demonstration or covering an event and my
[01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:53.440]  camera's off and somebody punches me in the arm and grabs my shirt. I turn around, they
[01:33:53.440 --> 01:33:56.440]  look at me, they go, when we take over, you and your family are dead.
[01:33:56.440 --> 01:34:02.440]  I'm like, oh, you're real powerful. Oh, let me guess, you're here with the police. They'll
[01:34:02.440 --> 01:34:05.440]  be the fake liberal activist leaders and the police are there to back them up. Don't even
[01:34:05.440 --> 01:34:08.440]  know why they've been told to back them up, but it's under orders. Trying to get me to
[01:34:08.440 --> 01:34:15.440]  punch them in the nose so they can take me to jail. And then they also set me up and
[01:34:15.440 --> 01:34:17.440]  do stuff like kill Michelle Malkin.
[01:34:17.440 --> 01:34:21.440]  So I get blamed for it behind me going, kill Michelle Malkin, kill Michelle Malkin. I knew
[01:34:21.440 --> 01:34:26.440]  it was a setup, cuz an hour after I left, before it was even on YouTube or on the news,
[01:34:26.440 --> 01:34:31.440]  the Denver Post calls me, that was at the DNC in 08. And they go, Mr. Jones, we heard
[01:34:31.440 --> 01:34:35.440]  you said kill Michelle Malkin. And I went, that was like, I looked at my watch, I go,
[01:34:35.440 --> 01:34:38.440]  that was like an hour ago, an hour ago.
[01:34:38.440 --> 01:34:42.440]  This is a setup. I did not say that. There were guys behind me who weren't with me screaming
[01:34:42.440 --> 01:34:47.440]  it. Can you prove they weren't with you? And I was like, what? Then 10 minutes later, Extra
[01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:50.440]  already had my number. We'd like to drop by and do an interview with you about what you
[01:34:50.440 --> 01:34:55.440]  did. And then they came by. I met them at the apartment we'd rented, cuz the hotels
[01:34:55.440 --> 01:34:56.440]  were all full.
[01:34:56.440 --> 01:35:00.440]  They show up, the guy laughs at me, leaves, they put on the news. Alex claims he didn't
[01:35:00.440 --> 01:35:04.440]  say killer. And I was trying to show the guy the video on our camera. Thank God it got
[01:35:04.440 --> 01:35:09.440]  out. The guy that fills in for Rush Limbaugh came out and said I said it. I'm already digressing.
[01:35:09.440 --> 01:35:14.440]  See, I'm having flashbacks to things that have gone on. The point is, is that they all,
[01:35:14.440 --> 01:35:15.440]  I'm not exaggerating.
[01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:22.440]  I've probably been told by so-called leftists 20 times that they wanna kill me. And it's
[01:35:22.440 --> 01:35:26.440]  a standard deal. See, they fantasize about when they've got the guns and everything you
[01:35:26.440 --> 01:35:31.440]  produce is theirs. They're authoritarians. There isn't left and right when you really
[01:35:31.440 --> 01:35:33.440]  get down to it. There's freedom and there's slavery.
[01:35:33.440 --> 01:35:37.440]  The Nazis were called socialist, but the media calls them fascist. Same thing in the final
[01:35:37.440 --> 01:35:44.440]  equation. It's just different ways you arrange deck chairs on the Titanic. It makes me sick.
[01:35:44.440 --> 01:35:48.440]  I'm so tired of it. I wanna go to Dr. Gold. I got your calls. We're loaded. I got a bunch
[01:35:48.440 --> 01:35:51.440]  of health news. I got Joseph Farah coming up briefly.
[01:35:51.440 --> 01:35:57.440]  We are listeners supported here. And for TV viewers, we'll roll some of this video. We
[01:35:57.440 --> 01:36:01.440]  carry the pro one best gravity fed filter, stainless steel out there. You're gonna find
[01:36:01.440 --> 01:36:06.440]  anywhere with a new pro one system that cuts out the hydrofluorosolic acid, not just the
[01:36:06.440 --> 01:36:07.440]  fluoride.
[01:36:07.440 --> 01:36:11.440]  We've got the new Obama choker tyrant shirt with the come and take it on the back. Best
[01:36:11.440 --> 01:36:17.440]  seller info war store.com. We've got all the other books and videos and strategic relocation
[01:36:17.440 --> 01:36:22.440]  and why the tyrants want your guns. By the way, the local newspaper published a deal
[01:36:22.440 --> 01:36:25.440]  about how my magazine shouldn't be allowed on the streets of Austin. I forgot to get
[01:36:25.440 --> 01:36:26.440]  that article and cover that.
[01:36:26.440 --> 01:36:30.440]  I'm gonna cover that next hour. See, I can't even keep track of this anymore. The point
[01:36:30.440 --> 01:36:35.440]  is these people and they say, and I bet Alex says this just proves that liberals are authoritarians,
[01:36:35.440 --> 01:36:39.440]  but we don't want your magazine on the streets of Austin. We need people to not allow his
[01:36:39.440 --> 01:36:41.440]  magazine on the streets of Austin.
[01:36:41.440 --> 01:36:45.440]  I mean, this is just amazing and they're trying to get them off the streets. People are stealing
[01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:50.440]  them, covering them up, throwing them away. The establishment is because I put 60 plus
[01:36:50.440 --> 01:36:54.440]  thousand on the streets of Austin, 20,000 on the streets of San Antonio. The point is
[01:36:54.440 --> 01:36:59.440]  these people are authoritarian demons and the second of them is there to protect us
[01:36:59.440 --> 01:37:00.440]  from them.
[01:37:00.440 --> 01:37:06.440]  So info war store.com, ladies and gentlemen. And lastly, I love polymer so much. I'm gonna
[01:37:06.440 --> 01:37:11.440]  be honest with you. I approached Dr. Corey Gold. He's not here to infomercial today,
[01:37:11.440 --> 01:37:16.440]  but it is a sponsor and it's awesome. This is the best energy drink out there with the
[01:37:16.440 --> 01:37:22.440]  bee pollen and all the other trace minerals and vitamins and vitamin A, B1, B3, B6, B12
[01:37:22.440 --> 01:37:24.440]  and just huge dosages.
[01:37:24.440 --> 01:37:31.440]  Vitamin D3, a small amount, 75 milligrams of naturally occurring green tea based caffeine
[01:37:31.440 --> 01:37:37.440]  and some other stuff in it. And it only has a tiny amount of sugar in it to make it sweet.
[01:37:37.440 --> 01:37:42.440]  And I can't take regular energy drinks. This stuff is amazing. And he said, well, it's
[01:37:42.440 --> 01:37:46.440]  funny. You say you like polymer so much and would like to endorse it. We're coming out
[01:37:46.440 --> 01:37:51.440]  with one that has extra antioxidants in the New Zealand. What is it? Current blackberry.
[01:37:51.440 --> 01:37:57.440]  I forget. The point is, I like the old fashioned kind with the berry burst flavor.
[01:37:57.440 --> 01:38:06.440]  Polymers is powered by bioavailable superoxide. I'm gonna have him break it all down with
[01:38:06.440 --> 01:38:10.440]  this. Here in just a moment. The point is, is that it's awesome and it's all available
[01:38:10.440 --> 01:38:13.440]  at info wars health dot com.

[01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:30.440]  this, but Doc, tell us a little bit about polymers plus and some of the other products
[01:38:30.440 --> 01:38:34.440]  you formulated that are available at info wars health dot com.
[01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:38.440]  Well, the best, you know, you've been talking a lot on your show about what's happening
[01:38:38.440 --> 01:38:43.440]  with the medical systems. I got stacks of stacks of things that will go over at some
[01:38:43.440 --> 01:38:50.440]  other point of newspapers admitting that literally a thousand people a week die from medical
[01:38:50.440 --> 01:38:54.440]  errors, not from being really sick and dying in the hospital, but from errors and different
[01:38:54.440 --> 01:38:58.440]  things that are going on in the way our food chain is being degraded.
[01:38:58.440 --> 01:39:02.440]  Look at all. Go to drudge report dot com right now and look at how much they're finding
[01:39:02.440 --> 01:39:07.440]  out that horse meat is all over the food chain right now. But supposedly the government's
[01:39:07.440 --> 01:39:11.440]  protecting you from horse meat, but it's literally everywhere and it's filled with dangerous
[01:39:11.440 --> 01:39:17.440]  horse drugs. It is. And we now know that there's actually pharmaceutical drugs in the water
[01:39:17.440 --> 01:39:21.440]  supply of 26 major cities and probably the rest as well.
[01:39:21.440 --> 01:39:26.440]  So what we're advocating is do things to protect yourself. Go out there and take things that
[01:39:26.440 --> 01:39:31.440]  will, you know, help boost your immune system and give yourself the vitamins and minerals
[01:39:31.440 --> 01:39:35.440]  and essential fatty acids that you need. And one of the products that you talked about
[01:39:35.440 --> 01:39:41.440]  that's available at infowarsteam.com is Polymers Plus. And Polymers Plus is a product that
[01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:46.440]  we talked about for a long time and came out with in like mind here. And the ingredient
[01:39:46.440 --> 01:39:51.440]  you were talking about was called superoxide dismutase. And that's a really very powerful
[01:39:51.440 --> 01:39:56.440]  antioxidant. And I know it sounds scary. Superoxide dismutase sounds like something like, you
[01:39:56.440 --> 01:40:00.440]  know, from a James Bond movie, but it's really something that your body makes itself. Your
[01:40:00.440 --> 01:40:05.440]  body makes three different types of antioxidants to protect yourself. The most important one
[01:40:05.440 --> 01:40:09.440]  that your body makes every single day is superoxide dismutase. And this is a product that contains
[01:40:09.440 --> 01:40:14.440]  a bioavailable form of it so your body can use it. And that's what's important. So when
[01:40:14.440 --> 01:40:18.440]  you have an immune reaction, you need to fight off something. You have those.
[01:40:18.440 --> 01:40:22.440]  Tell us about the berry, why it's so supercharged. What type of berry is that?
[01:40:22.440 --> 01:40:28.440]  It's New Zealand blackcurrant. And that's a very powerful antioxidant source. As certain
[01:40:28.440 --> 01:40:31.440]  fruits and vegetables we know have a lot of antioxidants.
[01:40:31.440 --> 01:40:34.440]  But there is one product better, Froot Loops is more healthy.
[01:40:34.440 --> 01:40:38.440]  Well, Froot Loops, because it has the word fruit in it. So of course, it's got to be
[01:40:38.440 --> 01:40:43.440]  good for you because it has the word fruit in it. But no, Froot Loops is bad.
[01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:44.440]  I'm joking. I'm sorry.
[01:40:44.440 --> 01:40:48.440]  Because somebody's going to listen and go, Dr. Gold says to eat Froot Loops. No, don't
[01:40:48.440 --> 01:40:52.440]  eat Froot Loops. But you know, there's certain foods that have strong antioxidants. Your
[01:40:52.440 --> 01:40:57.440]  body needs antioxidants, especially nowadays. I mean, look at what's coming at us every
[01:40:57.440 --> 01:41:01.440]  time you breathe, every time you drink water, every time you take food. You don't know
[01:41:01.440 --> 01:41:04.440]  what's in it. So your body has to be prepared to deal with it.
[01:41:04.440 --> 01:41:10.440]  And Polymers Plus and the Alex Pack as well, which is a complete daily source of nutrition
[01:41:10.440 --> 01:41:15.440]  from the Omega oils to the calcium magnesium sources to the 90 essential nutrients that
[01:41:15.440 --> 01:41:19.440]  people need for life. All can be found at InfowarsTeam.com.
[01:41:19.440 --> 01:41:24.440]  But what we're doing is we're simply trying to go back to say, we need to eat things that
[01:41:24.440 --> 01:41:29.440]  eat things that make sense. And we need to get our nutrition. That's vitamins, minerals,
[01:41:29.440 --> 01:41:33.440]  essential oils. And you're not getting it in the fast food line. You're not getting
[01:41:33.440 --> 01:41:36.440]  it from the can that you're eating. You're not getting it in the things that the schools
[01:41:36.440 --> 01:41:37.440]  are giving your children.
[01:41:37.440 --> 01:41:43.440]  But the government says that genetically modified organisms are good for me. And they say aspartame
[01:41:43.440 --> 01:41:47.440]  and sodium fluoride is good for me. And they wouldn't lie to me. They never lied to us.
[01:41:47.440 --> 01:41:48.440]  They didn't burn down Dorner's Cabin.
[01:41:48.440 --> 01:41:53.440]  You know, that's one that I got a bone to pick with. I mean, they are there are certain
[01:41:53.440 --> 01:41:57.440]  things that they tell us that we need to do that are so backwards that it makes your mind
[01:41:57.440 --> 01:42:01.440]  blow. And you have to ask yourself, why do they say that? Are they just that naive or
[01:42:01.440 --> 01:42:05.440]  are they that diabolical? I like to think naive, you probably go diabolical, but whatever
[01:42:05.440 --> 01:42:10.440]  reason is, it's bad. And we're not getting the things we need from our diet. Every, every
[01:42:10.440 --> 01:42:14.440]  person intuitively knows that. They know that when they go through the drive through, they
[01:42:14.440 --> 01:42:17.440]  know that when they see the food that looks funny in the store, like why does it have
[01:42:17.440 --> 01:42:21.440]  that great color to that fruit? It's been sitting there six weeks and it still looks
[01:42:21.440 --> 01:42:25.440]  brand new and delicious. Why is that thing have a three year shelf life when it's something
[01:42:25.440 --> 01:42:30.440]  that in real life would go bad in three weeks? All those things are bad for you. And we know
[01:42:30.440 --> 01:42:33.440]  it. We know it. They're cheap foods and we know it.
[01:42:33.440 --> 01:42:38.440]  Well, that's like super size me. All the other hamburger brands under glass rotted. It didn't
[01:42:38.440 --> 01:42:43.440]  ever rot. It's eternal. Oh yeah. I mean, when you, when you look at a Twinkie and it says
[01:42:43.440 --> 01:42:47.440]  this, I'll put it in your, you know, your kit in case there's a earthquake is a last
[01:42:47.440 --> 01:42:52.440]  forever. Nothing. You know, food is degrades over time. And if you put it, if you cut a
[01:42:52.440 --> 01:42:56.440]  good apple up and you stick it outside, you come back an hour, an hour later, it's gray
[01:42:56.440 --> 01:42:59.440]  and there's a reason it's degrading right from, right from that very moment.
[01:42:59.440 --> 01:43:04.440]  It's oxidizing. It's alive. Exactly. And you want living food and you don't want food that's
[01:43:04.440 --> 01:43:10.440]  synthetic and you want to avoid GMOs. I don't want food that's been hybrid with an insect.
[01:43:10.440 --> 01:43:15.440]  You know what? I think you're being an extremist. I saw where they're coming out with insect
[01:43:15.440 --> 01:43:20.440]  viruses engineered into the food to forcibly give us vaccines, but, and that these things
[01:43:20.440 --> 01:43:24.440]  are already in the food chain. I think that's great to have Bill Gates forcing viruses into
[01:43:24.440 --> 01:43:30.440]  me through my food. And I just sure as dad ran Planned Parenthood. Sure. He's a eugenicist.
[01:43:30.440 --> 01:43:34.440]  I think he's a loving person. And would you like to take time out to apologize to the
[01:43:34.440 --> 01:43:39.440]  establishment and come on, you know, you want genetically modified insect viruses in your
[01:43:39.440 --> 01:43:42.440]  food, Dr. Gold, just admit it. It's normal.
[01:43:42.440 --> 01:43:45.440]  I can't even do that because somebody will cut this up and say that I said that, but
[01:43:45.440 --> 01:43:51.440]  I'm so opposed to that. My God, they're saying it's natural to take a beetle and to put it
[01:43:51.440 --> 01:43:56.440]  onto a, uh, to an era corn. And somehow that's nature's way of making things that that's
[01:43:56.440 --> 01:44:00.440]  not nature's way. No, you're an extremist. Stop right now. Yeah, I am extremist. They're
[01:44:00.440 --> 01:44:05.440]  probably waiting outside my door right now, but you know, they're openly having conversations
[01:44:05.440 --> 01:44:06.440]  right now.
[01:44:06.440 --> 01:44:11.440]  You know, it might be in the best interest of the public. We added lithium to the water
[01:44:11.440 --> 01:44:15.440]  because where there's lithium in the water and higher concentrations, people are happier
[01:44:15.440 --> 01:44:20.440]  and people shouldn't have sad emotions and people shouldn't react negatively to bad events
[01:44:20.440 --> 01:44:24.440]  happening to them. And if we just gave everybody lithium in the water supply, people wouldn't
[01:44:24.440 --> 01:44:28.440]  care when you confiscate their guns or when they didn't have food or when they're, you
[01:44:28.440 --> 01:44:32.440]  know, when things weren't going right for them and don't people need to be happy. Isn't
[01:44:32.440 --> 01:44:36.440]  that the ultimate role of government to make sure that everybody's happy. So wouldn't lithium
[01:44:36.440 --> 01:44:37.440]  be good in your water?
[01:44:37.440 --> 01:44:42.440]  Sounds a lot of freedom to me. They're having these discussions in these these councils,
[01:44:42.440 --> 01:44:46.440]  the same councils that said that abortion was loving are now talking about putting lithium
[01:44:46.440 --> 01:44:50.440]  in your water to keep you happy. Well, also, since we last talked now, it's it's starting
[01:44:50.440 --> 01:44:55.440]  in Denver and other cities, not just Chicago, where parents can't pack their kids' lunches.
[01:44:55.440 --> 01:45:00.440]  I think that's totally reasonable. These these parents are there to provide a child to the
[01:45:00.440 --> 01:45:07.440]  state to be raised, to be part of the greater system. And you sent you sent an email. You'd
[01:45:07.440 --> 01:45:12.440]  like to talk about that. I mean, would you like I mean, that is extreme. You think parents
[01:45:12.440 --> 01:45:16.440]  should be able to pack lunches? Whoa, whoa.
[01:45:16.440 --> 01:45:21.440]  Yeah, I get this crazy notion that I'm the parent and the school is there to teach my
[01:45:21.440 --> 01:45:27.440]  children, but I'm the parent. And I know I'm crazy because nowadays there there's two reasons
[01:45:27.440 --> 01:45:32.440]  why the schools, in my opinion, are confiscating school lunches. One is power is that we get
[01:45:32.440 --> 01:45:37.440]  your parents are not your power at your parents. We can control money. You got it. That's number
[01:45:37.440 --> 01:45:42.440]  two. If we can make all the kids eat school lunches, we just get more money from the government
[01:45:42.440 --> 01:45:46.440]  that we can go out to our friends and we can decide where this money goes. More kickbacks
[01:45:46.440 --> 01:45:52.440]  on the horse meat. You got it. So if we decide that all people have to eat government lunches,
[01:45:52.440 --> 01:45:56.440]  that means got bigger government programs, bigger tax increases that we can feed the
[01:45:56.440 --> 01:46:00.440]  children the foods we want them to be fed. And we'll show you who's in charge of your
[01:46:00.440 --> 01:46:05.440]  children. Yeah, the new report is North Carolina school officials. Those are not servants.
[01:46:05.440 --> 01:46:09.440]  They're officials. And we're civilians here in the military occupation. Let's go to some
[01:46:09.440 --> 01:46:13.440]  other news here. What's some of the other medical and health news you've got for us?
[01:46:13.440 --> 01:46:18.440]  There's a big stack of it here. Yeah, one of my favorite ones and it makes me crazy
[01:46:18.440 --> 01:46:23.440]  that no one grabs upon this. There was a and your group has it there. It's a USA Today
[01:46:23.440 --> 01:46:29.440]  article that says between 50,000 and 100,000 people die every single year in the United
[01:46:29.440 --> 01:46:35.440]  States from medical accidents. Okay, these are not people that were sick and died. These
[01:46:35.440 --> 01:46:41.440]  were people who died from medical accidents. That's roughly 1000 a week on the low side.
[01:46:41.440 --> 01:46:47.440]  Could you imagine if three people died from taking a vitamin? If three people die from
[01:46:47.440 --> 01:46:51.440]  taking a vitamin, the government was shut down every vitamin store in America because
[01:46:51.440 --> 01:46:55.440]  three people would die from a vitamin. What about the death panels now where they're confirming?
[01:46:55.440 --> 01:47:00.440]  Well, you know what? You're 65. You don't get that eye surgery now. Even if you have
[01:47:00.440 --> 01:47:05.440]  the insurance, they're going to say we don't authorize it. And now the payroll tax is going
[01:47:05.440 --> 01:47:10.440]  up. The nightmare of the total government takeover, your medical records to the IRS.
[01:47:10.440 --> 01:47:17.440]  I mean, it is all beyond bizarro what we're putting up with. And these idiot Obama supporters
[01:47:17.440 --> 01:47:22.440]  really thought they were going to get something free. Well, I think some people would justify
[01:47:22.440 --> 01:47:26.440]  in their head. Well, if we kill these old people, there'll be more money for us. Therefore,
[01:47:26.440 --> 01:47:31.440]  we can get another a second Obama phone or maybe an Obama iPad or something like that
[01:47:31.440 --> 01:47:35.440]  that we can have now if we get rid of all these people. I bet you there's a certain
[01:47:35.440 --> 01:47:39.440]  group of the population that would say if we increased abortions and got rid of everybody
[01:47:39.440 --> 01:47:43.440]  over age 70, if they were told they would get an extra $5,000 a year benefit, they say
[01:47:43.440 --> 01:47:48.440]  that was a great idea. Oh, no, no, no. They've got a big bioethicist group coming out, as
[01:47:48.440 --> 01:47:54.440]  you know, saying kill babies up to age three if you want. And then now they've got globalist
[01:47:54.440 --> 01:48:00.440]  out saying expert combat terrorism with highly drastic population control. Just get rid of
[01:48:00.440 --> 01:48:05.440]  people and then you won't have any problems. I mean, I mean, this is wild authoritarians.
[01:48:05.440 --> 01:48:09.440]  But as long as they call themselves liberal, we just fall down and do whatever they say.
[01:48:09.440 --> 01:48:14.440]  And the last time we heard this logic train going down the track, it was Adolf Hitler.
[01:48:14.440 --> 01:48:18.440]  And Adolf Hitler was talking about, well, you know, these people are mentally incapable.
[01:48:18.440 --> 01:48:21.440]  Will this kill them? And these people are a drain on society.
[01:48:21.440 --> 01:48:27.440]  It started with bioethics, death panels that first started in 1934 Germany. For those that
[01:48:27.440 --> 01:48:32.440]  don't know, there's many documentaries and books on on record. And they take your kid
[01:48:32.440 --> 01:48:36.440]  and they made bad grades by like 38. It got so bad. First, it was the mentally retarded.
[01:48:36.440 --> 01:48:39.440]  Then it was the deformed. Then it was, you know, if you had a cleft foot and then it
[01:48:39.440 --> 01:48:42.440]  was, oh, we're taking junior for testing. And it would be like, oh, your son died of
[01:48:42.440 --> 01:48:46.440]  a heart attack. They'd given these death receipts.
[01:48:46.440 --> 01:48:49.440]  And they and they justified it, saying at the end of the day, we're just going to have
[01:48:49.440 --> 01:48:54.440]  smart, able, intelligent, physically fit people. We're going to remove from the gene pool everything
[01:48:54.440 --> 01:48:59.440]  that we don't like. And eventually that became everything but a very small subset. And here
[01:48:59.440 --> 01:49:02.440]  we are today saying, you know, the government's taking more and more control, but it's for
[01:49:02.440 --> 01:49:07.440]  your own good. And I can't think of a single program in the United States that was ever
[01:49:07.440 --> 01:49:11.440]  taken over by the government that's better than it was when it was private and the government
[01:49:11.440 --> 01:49:16.440]  did it for more effectively and more cost effectively and more efficiently, nothing.
[01:49:16.440 --> 01:49:20.440]  So I can't see why people would want to turn more power over to the government.
[01:49:20.440 --> 01:49:25.440]  By the way, here's the Austin Chronicle that I've talked to people on the inside do not
[01:49:25.440 --> 01:49:30.440]  like the fact we're putting 60 plus thousand free 60 page color glossy magazines on the
[01:49:30.440 --> 01:49:35.440]  street to wake up the socialist and globalist around here. And I've talked to people who
[01:49:35.440 --> 01:49:39.440]  say that their liberal parents and stuff who aren't liberals are getting very, very upset
[01:49:39.440 --> 01:49:43.440]  about this and are upset that it's so well done.
[01:49:43.440 --> 01:49:47.440]  They actually published a letter to the editor saying, I've noticed the stacks of free copies
[01:49:47.440 --> 01:49:51.440]  of the Alex Jones fear mongering rag info wars have popped up everywhere around town
[01:49:51.440 --> 01:49:58.440]  from Dragon's Lair to Pluckers. Anyhow, but not surprising as Austin is his home turf.
[01:49:58.440 --> 01:50:03.440]  What is surprising is how many storefronts are so readily willing to distribute extremist
[01:50:03.440 --> 01:50:07.440]  literature on the premises. Let's face it, that's all info wars is. And it sure isn't
[01:50:07.440 --> 01:50:13.440]  helping bring the bitter political divide. They want to make us all submit a bridge the
[01:50:13.440 --> 01:50:16.440]  bitter political divide we've all had to deal with.
[01:50:16.440 --> 01:50:20.440]  So we need to submit and there'll be peace. I encourage anyone with a similar mind or
[01:50:20.440 --> 01:50:25.440]  just a working one to offer polite feedback to establishments handing out this derisive
[01:50:25.440 --> 01:50:30.440]  crap. Of course, free speech goes both ways. And if info wars is your bag, well, let me
[01:50:30.440 --> 01:50:34.440]  know and grab your free copies before Obama overturns the First Amendment.
[01:50:34.440 --> 01:50:40.440]  Jay Davis. So he's saying get rid of our free speech, shut us down, burn our books.
[01:50:40.440 --> 01:50:45.440]  But it doesn't exist. We're conspiracy theorists, Dr. Gold.
[01:50:45.440 --> 01:50:49.440]  You are. No, no, I mean, I mean, we are so bad.
[01:50:49.440 --> 01:50:54.440]  I mean, you know, we think they want to take our speech, but they do.
[01:50:54.440 --> 01:50:59.440]  But we're still crazy because we say they do because they have freedom of speech as long.
[01:50:59.440 --> 01:51:05.440]  It's all an agreement. Introducing pro wine. All of your filtration in one system portable
[01:51:05.440 --> 01:51:10.440]  on the go. No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[01:51:10.440 --> 01:51:15.440]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to ninety five percent of hydro
[01:51:15.440 --> 01:51:20.440]  fluorescent acid. Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white
[01:51:20.440 --> 01:51:25.440]  ceramic with new aqua medics, advanced media for removal of fluoride and other
[01:51:25.440 --> 01:51:30.440]  heavy metals, all in one filter element. It is the only one that does it. And out of the gates,
[01:51:30.440 --> 01:51:35.440]  we have a discounted at 10 percent off with promo code water. This is the only system
[01:51:35.440 --> 01:51:40.440]  that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides,
[01:51:40.440 --> 01:51:45.440]  chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosolic acid, the most
[01:51:45.440 --> 01:51:51.440]  common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands and sodium hexafluorosilicate.

[01:52:01.440 --> 01:52:07.440]  Hi there. My name is Frank Bates. What I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble.
[01:52:07.440 --> 01:52:12.440]  I just created a free video presentation at one two three cover up dot com that
[01:52:12.440 --> 01:52:17.440]  exposes the electricity monopolies and government agencies for what they really are. Incompetent
[01:52:17.440 --> 01:52:22.440]  line crooks that are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally
[01:52:22.440 --> 01:52:27.440]  high. Some have called this a conspiracy. Others have called it a cover up and you
[01:52:27.440 --> 01:52:32.440]  will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy goes. My video at
[01:52:32.440 --> 01:52:37.440]  one two three cover up dot com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them
[01:52:37.440 --> 01:52:42.440]  and how you can beat them to watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart
[01:52:42.440 --> 01:52:47.440]  patriots have already seen in the last three months. Go to one two three cover up dot com and discover
[01:52:47.440 --> 01:52:52.440]  one weird trick to slash your power bill and protect your home. Go watch my video
[01:52:52.440 --> 01:52:57.440]  now at one two three cover up dot com before they force me to shut it down.
[01:52:57.440 --> 01:53:02.440]  Again, that's one two three cover up dot com. It's time for a home security quiz.
[01:53:02.440 --> 01:53:07.440]  Answer this. What effective home security device is smaller than a coffee cup fakes out burglars
[01:53:07.440 --> 01:53:12.440]  into thinking someone is home at your house while you're away, plugs into any wall outlet, is
[01:53:12.440 --> 01:53:17.440]  recommended by many police departments and sells for less than thirty five dollars. Yes,
[01:53:17.440 --> 01:53:22.440]  it's fake TV. This year, about one in every 50 U.S. homes will have a break in
[01:53:22.440 --> 01:53:27.440]  with burglars usually picking the easy target, a dark house that looks like no one is
[01:53:27.440 --> 01:53:32.440]  home. Fake TV is a small electronic security device that makes it look like someone is home
[01:53:32.440 --> 01:53:37.440]  watching TV by simulating the light from a real TV. It's like a lamp on a timer, but
[01:53:37.440 --> 01:53:42.440]  far more convincing. And for only thirty four ninety five, fake TV could be the difference between
[01:53:42.440 --> 01:53:47.440]  coming home to a secure house or one that's been ransacked. Go to fake TV dot com
[01:53:47.440 --> 01:53:52.440]  or call one eight seven seven five fake TV. That's eight seven seven five
[01:53:52.440 --> 01:53:57.440]  three two five three eight eight or go to fake TV dot com Fake TV,
[01:53:57.440 --> 01:54:26.440]  the burglar deterrent.
[01:54:26.440 --> 01:54:31.440]  You know, I'm jamming in next hour because Joseph Farah is only joining us for about thirty five minutes.
[01:54:31.440 --> 01:54:37.440]  I need to get to the Obama State of the Union as well. Your calls are just too much to cover here, but
[01:54:37.440 --> 01:54:42.440]  the news is just getting so crazy. The system is trying to create racial division. The CBS
[01:54:42.440 --> 01:54:47.440]  for reporting parents complain about school ad, excluding whites from tutoring program, saying
[01:54:47.440 --> 01:54:52.440]  it's for black students only. And see, that's the political correctness.
[01:54:52.440 --> 01:54:57.440]  But then it's not that they actually want to give black people something extra. They want the state to
[01:54:57.440 --> 01:55:02.440]  fully absorb blacks because that's the group they've been targeting with eugenics from day one.
[01:55:02.440 --> 01:55:07.440]  It's not like, oh, we want to give you some free goodies. No, we want your kids all the time.
[01:55:07.440 --> 01:55:12.440]  I say that's a great idea to be excluded. They want the kids in school year
[01:55:12.440 --> 01:55:17.440]  round and they want them to like eight at night. That's the globalist model where the parents have to
[01:55:17.440 --> 01:55:22.440]  succeed. But this is so perfect now. Hey, that's racist. We want our kids at your school
[01:55:22.440 --> 01:55:27.440]  nonstop. Dr. Gold, your take on that. And then we're going to take some phone calls. You
[01:55:27.440 --> 01:55:32.440]  know, it's interesting. They've created this division where
[01:55:32.440 --> 01:55:37.440]  groups believe that they need extra help. And I and yet on the other hand, they don't want to be called
[01:55:37.440 --> 01:55:42.440]  less than. The reality is, is that every group and every people they work hard will do
[01:55:42.440 --> 01:55:47.440]  well. There's brilliant white people, brilliant black people, brilliant Asian people. And we just got to let those
[01:55:47.440 --> 01:55:52.440]  people do their thing. But we create this horrible culture for that group
[01:55:52.440 --> 01:55:57.440]  that they feel that they need this and they don't. And, you know, I thought it was
[01:55:57.440 --> 01:56:02.440]  interesting how Bill Cosby was demonized, was demonized for saying,
[01:56:02.440 --> 01:56:07.440]  hey, listen to my own group of people, your husband, stay with your wives, be
[01:56:07.440 --> 01:56:12.440]  fathers and kids go to school and put value on education. And
[01:56:12.440 --> 01:56:17.440]  that was considered to be with a turncoat on his own group for saying, you know, we should have
[01:56:17.440 --> 01:56:22.440]  husbands and wives staying together. Parents should be parents and kids should get education. And
[01:56:22.440 --> 01:56:27.440]  he was demonized by the mainstream for that, which makes me crazy.
[01:56:27.440 --> 01:56:32.440]  Punching up info wars dot com for people watching at prison planet dot tv. Missouri Democrats call for gun
[01:56:32.440 --> 01:56:37.440]  confiscation. The legislation has been introduced. The denial is over. And I count six
[01:56:37.440 --> 01:56:42.440]  other states with similar legislation. But then they say, we're not coming for your guns. You've just got to
[01:56:42.440 --> 01:56:47.440]  physically turn them in. Dr. Corey Gold joining us, advisor at info wars health dot com,
[01:56:47.440 --> 01:56:52.440]  syndicated radio host. What do you think is going to happen if they keep pushing this gun confiscation? I mean, it's
[01:56:52.440 --> 01:56:57.440]  clear. I think they want to start a civil war in this country. They're already billing Obama as the next Lincoln.
[01:56:57.440 --> 01:57:02.440]  Yeah. And there's talk now even on talk radio about, you know, should Obama,
[01:57:02.440 --> 01:57:07.440]  you know, he has such a big job to do. Should there be a third term for Barack Obama?
[01:57:07.440 --> 01:57:12.440]  Oh, yeah. Yeah. And if you don't want that, you're racist, too. And maybe we'll get
[01:57:12.440 --> 01:57:17.440]  around it by electing his wife, but let him really be in charge of everything because that would be still
[01:57:17.440 --> 01:57:22.440]  legal. So it's interesting to see where we're headed. You know, now Hillary Clinton's looking
[01:57:22.440 --> 01:57:27.440]  like she wants to make a comeback. So it's the same three or four families seeming to rule everything. Don't forget
[01:57:27.440 --> 01:57:32.440]  Janet Napolitano. Oh, yeah. Janet Napolitano. There'll be a Bush one and Bush two.
[01:57:32.440 --> 01:57:37.440]  Then you have Clinton one and you have Clinton two. Now we might have Obama one and
[01:57:37.440 --> 01:57:42.440]  Obama two. And yet, you know, people don't see. We know Obama has definitely taken a number two on us.
[01:57:42.440 --> 01:57:47.440]  Yeah, you're right. This is his second administration. I'm sorry. But
[01:57:47.440 --> 01:57:52.440]  I mean, it's bigger than that. It's bigger than that because he is just a puppet.
[01:57:52.440 --> 01:57:57.440]  But the way they can use him to create all this division, it is incredible to watch this
[01:57:57.440 --> 01:58:02.440]  unfold. And then he puts up Brennan, you know, for nomination right now who
[01:58:02.440 --> 01:58:07.440]  who was totally in favor of all these drones. And we know that we've had drones kill Americans
[01:58:07.440 --> 01:58:12.440]  on command, not by accident, but on command. The president of the United States ordering
[01:58:12.440 --> 01:58:17.440]  that, you know, our military to fire on Americans. Well, hey, that's what freedom is all about.
[01:58:17.440 --> 01:58:22.440]  We're going to come back to jam in some calls here for Julio. They've also been holding the longest
[01:58:22.440 --> 01:58:27.440]  Steve, Nick, Jason.
[01:58:27.440 --> 01:58:32.440]  And we'll also talk to Rob and others. Jason wants to talk about a drug
[01:58:32.440 --> 01:58:37.440]  commercially heard. Hey, I love the side effects for these prescription drugs. There aren't any side effects for the vitamins
[01:58:37.440 --> 01:58:42.440]  and minerals, folks. You are listening to

[01:58:52.440 --> 01:58:57.440]  The Second Amendment is in danger. How soon before your freedoms are taken away? What can you
[01:58:57.440 --> 01:59:02.440]  not live without? What is your greatest dependency? Is it your guns? Is it your home?
[01:59:02.440 --> 01:59:07.440]  No, it's food. It all boils down to the food supply. Tyrannical governments control
[01:59:07.440 --> 01:59:12.440]  people by controlling their food supply. Don't be dependent. Be self-sufficient. Don't wait for the

[01:59:57.440 --> 02:00:02.440]  GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:02.440 --> 02:00:07.440]  Big brother, mainstream
[02:00:07.440 --> 02:00:12.440]  media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so
[02:00:12.440 --> 02:00:17.440]  does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.440 --> 02:00:22.440]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.440 --> 02:00:27.440]  All
[02:00:27.440 --> 02:00:32.440]  right, let's jam in some phone calls and I'll get to the others that are holding too.
[02:00:32.440 --> 02:00:37.440]  I apologize. I'm out of control. Dr. Corey Gold's our guest here today.
[02:00:37.440 --> 02:00:42.440]  Let's talk to Jason in Tennessee and we'll go to Julio and others. Jason, you have a comment for Dr.
[02:00:42.440 --> 02:00:47.440]  Gold. Go ahead. Yeah, Alex. How are you doing today, buddy? Good, my friend. Go ahead.
[02:00:47.440 --> 02:00:52.440]  Good, good. Yeah, I haven't seen it before since a couple of weeks ago. I'm setting to work
[02:00:52.440 --> 02:00:57.440]  and I see a drug commercial come on TV. It was so out of it. I couldn't believe
[02:00:57.440 --> 02:01:02.440]  what I was hearing and I couldn't get the name of the drug or the name of the condition. But they said,
[02:01:02.440 --> 02:01:07.440]  do you ever laugh? Do you ever cry? You could have this condition.
[02:01:07.440 --> 02:01:12.440]  Ask your doctor if this pill is right for you. No, it's like signs that
[02:01:12.440 --> 02:01:17.440]  say, had trouble reading this? You have bad eyesight and it's blurred on purpose.
[02:01:17.440 --> 02:01:22.440]  Like having a heart attack come in to us so we can kill you. And it is this incredible deception.
[02:01:22.440 --> 02:01:27.440]  In fact, they have these psychological diagnostics. You ever get angry? You ever get upset? You ever get happy?
[02:01:27.440 --> 02:01:32.440]  Well, you're mentally ill and need serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Dr. Gold, I mean, these are just cold
[02:01:32.440 --> 02:01:37.440]  blooded companies shoving this down our throats. Well, they want us to believe that
[02:01:37.440 --> 02:01:42.440]  we should have a perfect life with no emotions or the emotions will always be happy. And they have these
[02:01:42.440 --> 02:01:47.440]  commercials that show these happy people doing happy people things, riding jet skis, taking
[02:01:47.440 --> 02:01:52.440]  Corvettes, walking on the beach, you know, living the lifestyle. And they want you to think that if you take their pill,
[02:01:52.440 --> 02:01:57.440]  that's somehow going to be your life. It's foolish to think so and that you could take a pill and that would make
[02:01:57.440 --> 02:02:02.440]  your life perfect. But they brainwash you into thinking that's what you need to do. We know what makes the establishment
[02:02:02.440 --> 02:02:07.440]  happy, stealing and endlessly lying and engaging in an almost satirical level corruption.
[02:02:07.440 --> 02:02:12.440]  Thank you, Jason. Do you ever flip out, Dr. Gold, just at how bizarre
[02:02:12.440 --> 02:02:17.440]  it's getting and that it's getting weirder and weirder? But see, we're the older generation now. The kids are growing
[02:02:17.440 --> 02:02:22.440]  up in this and the globalists say that they go, look, it doesn't matter if you don't buy what we're doing. We're
[02:02:22.440 --> 02:02:27.440]  here. It doesn't matter if it's absurd to you. We got your kids to where the kids get arrested for bubble guns.
[02:02:27.440 --> 02:02:32.440]  Oh, yeah. They actually you have a picture of a gun you can get thrown out of
[02:02:32.440 --> 02:02:37.440]  school, a picture of a gun like something that's out of a magazine. Kids are now being arrested for water guns.
[02:02:37.440 --> 02:02:42.440]  Oh, or expelled from school. Yeah, absolutely. No, no, no. One got arrested for brandishing
[02:02:42.440 --> 02:02:47.440]  a weapon last week. A water gun. Yeah. Well, you know,
[02:02:47.440 --> 02:02:52.440]  where where we go next with it, thinking probably the next thing is thinking about having a water gun is
[02:02:52.440 --> 02:02:57.440]  where you get arrested next. I had a doctor come up to me with a group of doctors saying, why do you do vitamins and
[02:02:57.440 --> 02:03:02.440]  minerals? There's no money in vitamins and minerals. The real money is in treating long term disease.
[02:03:02.440 --> 02:03:07.440]  And I just said, you are evil. Leave me. We are doctors. Our whole idea is to help people
[02:03:07.440 --> 02:03:12.440]  feel better and not be sick. It's not about what will get us the biggest return on our investment of going
[02:03:12.440 --> 02:03:17.440]  to. Well, that's why they got rid of the Hippocratic oath of Hippocrates, what, 15 years ago. Yeah.
[02:03:17.440 --> 02:03:22.440]  Yeah. Which is which was do no harm. Now it's like how do you find a way to make the most money
[02:03:22.440 --> 02:03:27.440]  off of a certain condition? How can you drain the insurance of that individual before
[02:03:27.440 --> 02:03:32.440]  they pass away? It's totally cold blooded. We're caught between the corrupt insurance
[02:03:32.440 --> 02:03:37.440]  companies and the government. We're in deep doo doo, as they say. Anyways, Julio in Illinois are on the air.
[02:03:37.440 --> 02:03:42.440]  A quick couple quick points. Number one, you mentioned GMOs
[02:03:42.440 --> 02:03:47.440]  earlier. It's funny. A couple weeks ago before the inauguration, I'm in D.C.
[02:03:47.440 --> 02:03:52.440]  covering a climate change conference for a documentary I'm doing. And I have a
[02:03:52.440 --> 02:03:57.440]  member of the United Nations. He works out in Africa telling me
[02:03:57.440 --> 02:04:02.440]  how wonderful drought resistant seeds are, how these type of seeds are going to
[02:04:02.440 --> 02:04:07.440]  help feed the world because of drought, because of human impacts, the climate change and how
[02:04:07.440 --> 02:04:12.440]  governments and private corporations like Monsanto are teaming together to help
[02:04:12.440 --> 02:04:17.440]  feed the world. Secondly, I was I was on a conference
[02:04:17.440 --> 02:04:22.440]  call yesterday with the C.F.R. and they're talking about climate change
[02:04:22.440 --> 02:04:27.440]  promoting carbon taxes. And I even asked the question about geoengineering
[02:04:27.440 --> 02:04:32.440]  and this guy from the C.F.R. admitted to me that that is something that they are looking into
[02:04:32.440 --> 02:04:37.440]  to help stop climate change. They're already doing it. They put a big report out a few years ago and admitted they're already
[02:04:37.440 --> 02:04:42.440]  doing it. That's called testing. See, when under U.S. code Title 50, Chapter 32
[02:04:42.440 --> 02:04:47.440]  subsection 1528 paragraph B, they can do lethal testing on you as
[02:04:47.440 --> 02:04:52.440]  long as it's testing. They can kill you. And I think that's reasonable. I think the government's
[02:04:52.440 --> 02:04:57.440]  saying, oh, my God, I think Dr. Corey Gold is an extremist. Don't go to mfallwarshealth.com
[02:04:57.440 --> 02:05:02.440]  Don't get polymers plus whatever you do.

[02:08:58.440 --> 02:09:08.440]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:09:08.440 --> 02:09:15.440]  Oh, yeah. The adventure is real, not simulated.
[02:09:15.440 --> 02:09:21.440]  The New World Order is real. The tyrant eugenicist globalist technocrats are real.
[02:09:21.440 --> 02:09:30.440]  But so are you. So am I. And so is Joseph Farah of World Net Daily and the Western Journalism Center.
[02:09:30.440 --> 02:09:34.440]  And he joins us in a moment. And then we're going to break down some of the State of the Union address.
[02:09:34.440 --> 02:09:40.440]  I didn't get to it all yesterday. The open dictatorial slagger that we're now seeing more and more.
[02:09:40.440 --> 02:09:44.440]  I also have several new affiliates I need to talk about and some stations in focus.
[02:09:44.440 --> 02:09:50.440]  But who knows? We'll get to it all. No rest for those that love liberty because the wicked never rest, do they?
[02:09:50.440 --> 02:09:55.440]  No rest for those of us that want to live in reality, not under the delusion of tyranny.
[02:09:55.440 --> 02:10:00.440]  Missouri Democrats introduced legislation to confiscate firearms. The bill is introduced.
[02:10:00.440 --> 02:10:07.440]  Remove the assault weapon in large capacity. Surrender the assault weapon in large capacity magazine to the appropriate law enforcement agency.
[02:10:07.440 --> 02:10:11.440]  And they may have the votes and the civil war will start.
[02:10:11.440 --> 02:10:18.440]  We've got footage I've even gotten to that's up on Infowars.com of the Constitution was basically storming the Capitol,
[02:10:18.440 --> 02:10:23.440]  shouting down the gun grabbers and committees and press conferences, saying you're not getting our guns and not backing off.
[02:10:23.440 --> 02:10:28.440]  And the cops in the Capitol can do nothing. We have the power and you're not getting our guns scum.
[02:10:28.440 --> 02:10:35.440]  I think Piers Morgan behind the scenes, I said, listen, I know you're coming for the guns and thank you for being out in the open about it.
[02:10:35.440 --> 02:10:39.440]  I said, you're a gangster and you're going to fail. I said that to him at the end of the interview.
[02:10:39.440 --> 02:10:46.440]  He said, that's it. I panic. Get out of here. And by the way, I talked to CNN producers two weeks ago when I went down to South Texas where Piers Morgan was at.
[02:10:46.440 --> 02:10:49.440]  They let me in the back door at the big gun shop.
[02:10:49.440 --> 02:10:58.440]  I was in firearms tactical, tactical firearms, and I went in and surprised Morgan. I had to promise to be polite.
[02:10:58.440 --> 02:11:03.440]  That video is online. But the producer, once the cameras were off, were, yes, you're right, it's the highest ratings we ever had.
[02:11:03.440 --> 02:11:10.440]  I want to get you back on, but certain people don't. Well, Morgan told me he didn't want to because I smashed his butt.
[02:11:10.440 --> 02:11:14.440]  And I haven't really been talking about that the last few weeks, but I wanted to ask Joseph Farah.
[02:11:14.440 --> 02:11:16.440]  I don't know what he's going to say. I haven't talked to him yet.
[02:11:16.440 --> 02:11:20.440]  I've talked to him on about all this stuff that's happening, gun confiscation bills in Washington state.
[02:11:20.440 --> 02:11:27.440]  I mean, it is all on. I mean, these people are out of control and folks are like, well, start a civil war.
[02:11:27.440 --> 02:11:32.440]  They want that civil war. They want to brand him as Lincoln. We're all the evil confederates.
[02:11:32.440 --> 02:11:36.440]  That's what they say on the news. The movie's all about Lincoln. This is the plan.
[02:11:36.440 --> 02:11:42.440]  I said it four years ago. I said it was a possibility, but they were fantasizing about it.
[02:11:42.440 --> 02:11:48.440]  You know, not all their utopian fantasy dreams of the utopia for tyrants comes true because free humanity stands up against them.
[02:11:48.440 --> 02:11:58.440]  But Joseph Farah of WorldNetDaily.com, WND.com, no need to go over your bio for our audience of wonderful liberty lovers.
[02:11:58.440 --> 02:12:06.440]  What do you make of best selling author, I should add, what do you make of just the hyper craziness we're seeing?
[02:12:06.440 --> 02:12:13.440]  Or do you not think things are kind of going into an even more bizarro alternate dimension almost?
[02:12:13.440 --> 02:12:18.440]  I mean, where do you think all of this is going right now, Joseph Farah of WorldNetDaily?
[02:12:18.440 --> 02:12:28.440]  Well, you know what I think this is all about? I mean, number one, you've got the, you know, the DHS stockpiling munitions and weapons.
[02:12:28.440 --> 02:12:34.440]  And you've got, you know, all the legislation that's being talked about, the confiscate guns.
[02:12:34.440 --> 02:12:40.440]  And really, I think it's about three things. One is intimidation. It's a trial balloon.
[02:12:40.440 --> 02:12:43.440]  I want to see what kind of resistance there is.
[02:12:43.440 --> 02:12:51.440]  And I thought one of the interesting things, I watched the State of the Union address, Alex, and I watched it on Bing.
[02:12:51.440 --> 02:12:55.440]  You know, Bing was measuring audience response.
[02:12:55.440 --> 02:13:03.440]  People were voting by the billions, by the way, on what they thought at various moments during the speech.
[02:13:03.440 --> 02:13:09.440]  The low point of his speech was when he talked about gun confiscation.
[02:13:09.440 --> 02:13:14.440]  And it wasn't just the Republicans and independents, it was the Democrats.
[02:13:14.440 --> 02:13:21.440]  Way, way down, it was like 75 percent negative overall.
[02:13:21.440 --> 02:13:30.440]  And the Democrats were, you know, negative far below the median line where it jumps from, you know, negative to positive.
[02:13:30.440 --> 02:13:38.440]  I thought that was very encouraging, but I think, you know, intimidation, trial balloon, they want to see what they can get away with.
[02:13:38.440 --> 02:13:45.440]  And the third thing is this is part of a long-term trend, and it's not just Obama.
[02:13:45.440 --> 02:13:53.440]  We can't just blame Obama or the Democrats, because we've been tracking this for years, and you know it, too,
[02:13:53.440 --> 02:13:59.440]  that what we're seeing is the militarization of the federal government domestically.
[02:13:59.440 --> 02:14:05.440]  This has been going on for as long as we've been doing WND, we've been doing stories about this.
[02:14:05.440 --> 02:14:11.440]  I remember in 96, 97, 98, you guys even carried some of the reports that we broke, what was it,
[02:14:11.440 --> 02:14:14.440]  Bresnahan was the writer, about all the Delta Force business.
[02:14:14.440 --> 02:14:15.440]  Exactly, exactly.
[02:14:15.440 --> 02:14:23.440]  But also we're talking about every agency of the federal government has police forces, armed police forces.
[02:14:23.440 --> 02:14:27.440]  Well, here's the deal, it was creepy and unconstitutional 16, 17 years ago.
[02:14:27.440 --> 02:14:34.440]  Now it's on Hyperwarp, and no exaggeration, several hundred times bigger than what it was.
[02:14:34.440 --> 02:14:37.440]  I mean, it is like a cancer racing.
[02:14:37.440 --> 02:14:39.440]  That's exactly right.
[02:14:39.440 --> 02:14:48.440]  And it's because, you know, it's because, look, Obama was very clear about where he stood on this when he ran for election the first time,
[02:14:48.440 --> 02:14:55.440]  and when he ran for election the second time, and he figures he's got nothing to lose, you know, he's termed out.
[02:14:55.440 --> 02:14:58.440]  And so he's going all the way with this.
[02:14:58.440 --> 02:15:02.440]  He wants a domestic security force just as big, just as strong as our military.
[02:15:02.440 --> 02:15:07.440]  That's what he said, nobody knew what he meant, nobody even listened to it really.
[02:15:07.440 --> 02:15:09.440]  But what does that mean?
[02:15:09.440 --> 02:15:12.440]  And I think we can see it now.
[02:15:12.440 --> 02:15:20.440]  You know, he wasn't really talking probably about creating one agency, it's all of the agencies together.
[02:15:20.440 --> 02:15:27.440]  And when you put them all together and you talk about the firepower that they have, it is pretty intimidating and pretty overwhelming.
[02:15:27.440 --> 02:15:29.440]  And it's not what our founders intended.
[02:15:29.440 --> 02:15:35.440]  By the way, is that a new slogan you guys used, the way to counteract 1984 is 1776?
[02:15:35.440 --> 02:15:36.440]  I just love that.
[02:15:36.440 --> 02:15:40.440]  Absolutely, it was a, actually I didn't coin that.
[02:15:40.440 --> 02:15:48.440]  I mean, I popularized it, but there was a economist, in fact he was formerly a top Canadian economist who came out to my Bilderberg protest,
[02:15:48.440 --> 02:15:50.440]  he just died a few years ago, I forget his name.
[02:15:50.440 --> 02:15:54.440]  Aaron knows that we asked him the name of the guy, he's actually in Endgame for a second.
[02:15:54.440 --> 02:15:56.440]  Well we don't care, we'll just steal it from him anyway.
[02:15:56.440 --> 02:15:58.440]  Exactly, but the point is I'll always digress.
[02:15:58.440 --> 02:16:05.440]  He said, Alex, have you ever thought the answer to the tyranny of 1984 is 1776?
[02:16:05.440 --> 02:16:08.440]  And it's a great play on words, you're right.
[02:16:08.440 --> 02:16:12.440]  It's beautiful because in a few words it tells us so much.
[02:16:12.440 --> 02:16:24.440]  The answer to tyranny, we don't need any new answers, we need the answers that emerged really for the first time in world history in 1776,
[02:16:24.440 --> 02:16:26.440]  in the colonies of this great country.
[02:16:26.440 --> 02:16:32.440]  It's what set us apart from every other country in the world, in the history of the world, and that's what we've got to get ourselves back to.
[02:16:32.440 --> 02:16:37.440]  It's so obvious, and the nice thing is I believe more and more people are seeing it,
[02:16:37.440 --> 02:16:47.440]  thanks in large part to your efforts, Alex, and other intrepid, independent media voices out there.
[02:16:47.440 --> 02:16:55.440]  You're right, and it was Jeremy Wright, filmmaker and economist, who I got to spend a few days with there at Boulderburg in 06 and drink a few beers with.
[02:16:55.440 --> 02:16:57.440]  Really nice guy, he coined that.
[02:16:57.440 --> 02:17:04.440]  Okay, now expanding on this, I just don't want to steal stuff posthumously, expanding on this,
[02:17:04.440 --> 02:17:08.440]  how do you think their power grab is going?
[02:17:08.440 --> 02:17:16.440]  Well, you know, I guess it depends on us really how it's going.
[02:17:16.440 --> 02:17:29.440]  If there is not real grassroots resistance emerging, even in the form of civil disobedience and so forth, then they're going to steamroll right over us.
[02:17:29.440 --> 02:17:38.440]  Look, I'm sure you're a shooter, I'm a shooter. I go to the range once or twice a week.
[02:17:38.440 --> 02:17:43.440]  They're rationing ammunition because the federal government is buying it all.
[02:17:43.440 --> 02:17:45.440]  What does that tell you?
[02:17:45.440 --> 02:17:57.440]  I mean, this is crazy, Alex, and I don't think it's because we bought so much ammunition and so many guns during the Christmas season.
[02:17:57.440 --> 02:18:06.440]  I think it's because of these DHS acquisitions and purchases and dozens and dozens of other government agencies.
[02:18:06.440 --> 02:18:13.440]  Oh yeah, every week it's like 21 million more, 50 million more, 10 million more, 300,000 more.
[02:18:13.440 --> 02:18:17.440]  I mean, it's up to 1.7 billion now in the last 15 months.
[02:18:17.440 --> 02:18:19.440]  And that's just DHS.
[02:18:19.440 --> 02:18:20.440]  That's just DHS.
[02:18:20.440 --> 02:18:21.440]  That's just DHS.
[02:18:21.440 --> 02:18:25.440]  We don't have the figures yet for when you add up all the other agencies.
[02:18:25.440 --> 02:18:30.440]  And what you've got here is essentially de facto gun control.
[02:18:30.440 --> 02:18:39.440]  It's de facto because if you don't have ammunition to fire, then what good is your gun?
[02:18:39.440 --> 02:18:44.440]  You know, I talked to somebody who's worked inside Barrett in Tennessee, I'll just leave it at that, the 50-cal,
[02:18:44.440 --> 02:18:49.440]  and they said the government will just buy whatever they make to drive the price up.
[02:18:49.440 --> 02:18:53.440]  And it was 5,000, then 8,000, then 10,000, then 15,000.
[02:18:53.440 --> 02:18:59.440]  I mean, you just won't be able to get it because the government will buy whatever they've got as a de facto ban.
[02:18:59.440 --> 02:19:02.440]  And whose money are they using to do that?
[02:19:02.440 --> 02:19:03.440]  Our money.
[02:19:03.440 --> 02:19:05.440]  Well, not really.
[02:19:05.440 --> 02:19:07.440]  They're just borrowing it.
[02:19:07.440 --> 02:19:10.440]  But in reality, it is our money.
[02:19:10.440 --> 02:19:16.440]  And that's a tragic irony here and something we're going to have to figure out.
[02:19:16.440 --> 02:19:19.440]  How do we stop that?
[02:19:19.440 --> 02:19:22.440]  I agree with you that it's up to us how this goes.
[02:19:22.440 --> 02:19:24.440]  I don't think it's going well for them, but they don't care.
[02:19:24.440 --> 02:19:30.440]  They're just committed and they've got some fantasy that he's going to be Abraham Lincoln and defeat everybody.
[02:19:30.440 --> 02:19:35.440]  These people are really like Hitler turning east into Russia.
[02:19:35.440 --> 02:19:38.440]  I think they're about to have their Waterloo.
[02:19:38.440 --> 02:19:44.440]  I was very encouraged by the response from the audience watching the State of the Union on that big thing.
[02:19:44.440 --> 02:19:47.440]  That was the absolute low point of his speech.
[02:19:47.440 --> 02:19:56.440]  By the way, the whole speech was bad and got negative response from almost almost all Democrats.
[02:19:56.440 --> 02:19:57.440]  Absolutely.
[02:19:57.440 --> 02:19:58.440]  Stay there. Joseph Farah is our guest.

[02:24:17.440 --> 02:24:21.440]  All right. Joseph Farrah is our guest. I heard that network. Adam is laughing really hard. I'm sorry.
[02:24:21.440 --> 02:24:25.440]  I just want. What are they not going to think of next?
[02:24:25.440 --> 02:24:29.440]  I mean, you know, I found myself laughing a lot more.
[02:24:29.440 --> 02:24:32.440]  Joseph Farrah of Roland Daily, because things are getting so crazy.
[02:24:32.440 --> 02:24:36.440]  What did you think of the whole Dorner situation?
[02:24:36.440 --> 02:24:41.440]  And then the police on now six different feeds saying, burn it down, burn the house down.
[02:24:41.440 --> 02:24:49.440]  And they're telling us that's not what that meant. It was reminding me of Waco.
[02:24:49.440 --> 02:24:54.440]  What kind of a diversion was that? What exactly can you translate?
[02:24:54.440 --> 02:25:00.440]  Burn it down. I don't get that exactly. This is a really peculiar thing.
[02:25:00.440 --> 02:25:05.440]  And one of the other things that struck me about the Dorner thing I wrote about this.
[02:25:05.440 --> 02:25:13.440]  You know, in his manifesto, he wrote about some people he really admired.
[02:25:13.440 --> 02:25:19.440]  And I noted that not one of those people, which includes both Barack and Michelle Obama,
[02:25:19.440 --> 02:25:24.440]  Piers Morgan, your buddy, Charlie Sheen and others.
[02:25:24.440 --> 02:25:32.440]  Out of all of the people he talked about who he liked, only Charlie Sheen actually tried to, you know, help the guy.
[02:25:32.440 --> 02:25:35.440]  Stop the guy. Talk him down.
[02:25:35.440 --> 02:25:43.440]  Now, you know, if there were a serial killer out there who said, I admire Alex Jones and Joseph Farrah,
[02:25:43.440 --> 02:25:51.440]  I think we'd be pretty quick out of the box to say, you know what, I want to distance myself from that.
[02:25:51.440 --> 02:25:53.440]  And, you know, here's a guy who-
[02:25:53.440 --> 02:25:59.440]  And what you're doing is wrong. Why didn't any of these 30 people or so come out and say, hey, buddy, don't do this?
[02:25:59.440 --> 02:26:07.440]  And can you imagine the reaction if it were that way? This guy loves the gun grabbers.
[02:26:07.440 --> 02:26:08.440]  And Obama.
[02:26:08.440 --> 02:26:16.440]  You know, but imagine if he admired Alex Jones and Joseph Farrah. What would be the media reaction to that?
[02:26:16.440 --> 02:26:21.440]  Well, what type of screwball thing is it that the citizens shouldn't have guns, but he's running around reportedly shooting people?
[02:26:21.440 --> 02:26:22.440]  It just shows-
[02:26:22.440 --> 02:26:33.440]  None of this makes any sense. Let me ask you a question. Do you believe that Barack Obama, let's just use Obama as the personification of gun grabbing.
[02:26:33.440 --> 02:26:40.440]  But, you know, let's think of him as the guy who represents the gun grabbing community out there.
[02:26:40.440 --> 02:26:49.440]  Do you really believe that Barack Obama believes that if you disarm the citizenry, that you're going to have less crime?
[02:26:49.440 --> 02:26:52.440]  No, it's all about authoritarian control.
[02:26:52.440 --> 02:27:04.440]  That's exactly right. It's about fomenting chaos and rebellion so that tyranny will, you know, succeed, arise. It's what all tyrants do.
[02:27:04.440 --> 02:27:09.440]  Do you agree that they want some type of civil war to paint conservatives, libertarians as terrorists?
[02:27:09.440 --> 02:27:12.440]  I think they want something very close to that.
[02:27:12.440 --> 02:27:13.440]  Yeah.
[02:27:13.440 --> 02:27:23.440]  And look, we're hearing calls, you know, everyone recognizes that the most dangerous place in the world right now, perhaps, is Chicago.
[02:27:23.440 --> 02:27:31.440]  You know, there are more people being killed in Chicago than in Afghanistan. So, what is the solution to that?
[02:27:31.440 --> 02:27:39.440]  People like Jesse Jackson and others are saying, well, DHS ought to go in there and solve this problem.
[02:27:39.440 --> 02:27:46.440]  What does that mean? This is exactly what they want. They want the federal government to answer the problem.
[02:27:46.440 --> 02:27:53.440]  So they create the problem and then they provide the solution, which is federal control over everyone.
[02:27:53.440 --> 02:28:03.440]  Yeah, they're trying to push people into a corner, staged up if they have to, and then basically have this big clash of civilizations against old Americans with the new socialist America.
[02:28:03.440 --> 02:28:06.440]  Let me briefly ask you, because I really want your opinion on this.
[02:28:06.440 --> 02:28:08.440]  What was your view of what happened with Piers Morgan?
[02:28:08.440 --> 02:28:10.440]  Give me your honest answer.
[02:28:10.440 --> 02:28:11.440]  You and Piers?
[02:28:11.440 --> 02:28:12.440]  Yeah.
[02:28:12.440 --> 02:28:13.440]  Well, you kicked his butt.
[02:28:13.440 --> 02:28:14.440]  Well, thank you.
[02:28:14.440 --> 02:28:22.440]  Ted Nugent, and if he's not going to have you back on again, you know what you should do? You should probably suggest to him, you know, listen, I know you're afraid to have me back on again.
[02:28:22.440 --> 02:28:26.440]  I know this guy, Farah, he's a pushover.
[02:28:26.440 --> 02:28:29.440]  Have him on now that the debate got control.
[02:28:29.440 --> 02:28:31.440]  No, he's probably afraid to have you on. No, that's the issue.
[02:28:31.440 --> 02:28:34.440]  No, they told me behind the scenes, I ran into him two weeks ago in Houston.
[02:28:34.440 --> 02:28:38.440]  His producers told me, oh, we had the highest ratings ever.
[02:28:38.440 --> 02:28:44.440]  Think, in two years of him, a flop, highest ratings ever, kept his ratings up for a week, but they're scared to have me back on.
[02:28:44.440 --> 02:28:47.440]  She said, we want you back on, but certain people don't.
[02:28:47.440 --> 02:28:50.440]  He told me, he said, I don't want to give you more attention.
[02:28:50.440 --> 02:28:52.440]  Like, he gives me attention.
[02:28:52.440 --> 02:28:54.440]  No, when I go on there, he gets attention.
[02:28:54.440 --> 02:29:03.440]  Well, the problem on this issue is, see, there is no intellectual, rational argument for gun control.
[02:29:03.440 --> 02:29:05.440]  I mean, what are you going to say?
[02:29:05.440 --> 02:29:08.440]  Are you going to say that it will reduce crime?
[02:29:08.440 --> 02:29:11.440]  All the statistical work has been done on this.
[02:29:11.440 --> 02:29:14.440]  The historical evidence is in.
[02:29:14.440 --> 02:29:16.440]  The verdict is in.
[02:29:16.440 --> 02:29:19.440]  I mean, it's just the opposite.
[02:29:19.440 --> 02:29:21.440]  And I believe Obama knows that.
[02:29:21.440 --> 02:29:24.440]  I believe, you know, maybe Piers Morgan doesn't know that.
[02:29:24.440 --> 02:29:26.440]  Maybe he's too stupid to understand that.
[02:29:26.440 --> 02:29:31.440]  But the people who are shaping this policy right now in this country, they know that.
[02:29:31.440 --> 02:29:35.440]  And it's really about fomenting chaos and civil strife.
[02:29:35.440 --> 02:29:36.440]  Absolutely.
[02:29:36.440 --> 02:29:40.440]  Let's come back and take a few calls for Joseph Farah and myself and the other side, and he's got to leave us.
[02:29:40.440 --> 02:29:42.440]  I'm going to break down some of the State of the Union.
[02:29:42.440 --> 02:29:44.440]  We have a clip of that coming up after the break.
[02:29:44.440 --> 02:29:50.440]  Stay with us.
[02:29:50.440 --> 02:30:01.440]  The Empire on the March, the Empire's on the Run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.440 --> 02:30:03.440]  Your freedoms are on the line.
[02:30:03.440 --> 02:30:05.440]  The Second Amendment is in danger.
[02:30:05.440 --> 02:30:07.440]  How soon before your freedoms are taken away?
[02:30:07.440 --> 02:30:09.440]  What can you not live without?
[02:30:09.440 --> 02:30:11.440]  What is your greatest dependency?
[02:30:11.440 --> 02:30:12.440]  Is it your guns?
[02:30:12.440 --> 02:30:13.440]  Is it your home?
[02:30:13.440 --> 02:30:14.440]  No, it's food.
[02:30:14.440 --> 02:30:16.440]  It all boils down to the food supply.
[02:30:16.440 --> 02:30:20.440]  Political governments control people by controlling their food supply.
[02:30:20.440 --> 02:30:21.440]  Don't be dependent.
[02:30:21.440 --> 02:30:22.440]  Be self-sufficient.
[02:30:22.440 --> 02:30:24.440]  Don't wait for the government to feed you.
[02:30:24.440 --> 02:30:25.440]  Feed yourself.
[02:30:25.440 --> 02:30:27.440]  I can warn you, but I can't feed you.
[02:30:27.440 --> 02:30:30.440]  Do like Alex has done and get a supply of food from eFoods Direct.

[02:31:06.440 --> 02:31:10.440]  then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[02:31:10.440 --> 02:31:14.440]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?

[02:33:03.440 --> 02:33:06.440]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:06.440 --> 02:33:11.440]  Some people say a man is made out of mud.
[02:33:11.440 --> 02:33:14.440]  A poor man's made out of muscle and blood.
[02:33:14.440 --> 02:33:17.440]  I've got a clip of Obama I want to play and then take a few of your calls.
[02:33:17.440 --> 02:33:21.440]  Joseph Farah's got to leave us then, and I'll get into the State of the Union in more calls.
[02:33:21.440 --> 02:33:24.440]  Really just an unbelievable State of the Union.
[02:33:24.440 --> 02:33:27.440]  It's so amazing that I don't even have words to describe it,
[02:33:27.440 --> 02:33:33.440]  but more and more I do think mainline conservatives are finally getting that the establishment,
[02:33:33.440 --> 02:33:36.440]  the big banks, the powers that be, they want a tyranny.
[02:33:36.440 --> 02:33:38.440]  They don't want a free market system.
[02:33:38.440 --> 02:33:42.440]  So I am hearing more and more of the big shows on radio admit that,
[02:33:42.440 --> 02:33:45.440]  okay, the government wants to destroy jobs, wants us dependent,
[02:33:45.440 --> 02:33:49.440]  and people are really getting that's not just a throwaway line,
[02:33:49.440 --> 02:33:51.440]  Joseph Farah of WorldNetDaily.
[02:33:51.440 --> 02:33:53.440]  This is really happening.
[02:33:53.440 --> 02:33:57.440]  So I do see the public really getting the fact that, you know,
[02:33:57.440 --> 02:34:00.440]  your low-level government folks and corporate people aren't bad,
[02:34:00.440 --> 02:34:03.440]  but up at the top it is a bunch of gangsters,
[02:34:03.440 --> 02:34:05.440]  and I just don't see them getting away with it.
[02:34:05.440 --> 02:34:08.440]  I want to play this clip, but what do you make of him saying,
[02:34:08.440 --> 02:34:10.440]  if they don't accept his green takeover,
[02:34:10.440 --> 02:34:13.440]  the shutting down of the power plants, all the rest of it,
[02:34:13.440 --> 02:34:15.440]  that he'll just act alone.
[02:34:15.440 --> 02:34:20.440]  I mean, isn't it time for Congress to move on so many fronts with articles of impeachment?
[02:34:20.440 --> 02:34:24.440]  Why is John Boehner sitting there just, you know,
[02:34:24.440 --> 02:34:26.440]  listening to that stoically,
[02:34:26.440 --> 02:34:32.440]  and the answer is that John Boehner and Barack Obama have a lot more in common
[02:34:32.440 --> 02:34:34.440]  than separates them.
[02:34:34.440 --> 02:34:35.440]  That's the problem.
[02:34:35.440 --> 02:34:37.440]  They're both establishment guys.
[02:34:37.440 --> 02:34:43.440]  They both recognize that they are on the side of the multinational corporation.
[02:34:43.440 --> 02:34:47.440]  By the way, there was one line in the speech, Alex,
[02:34:47.440 --> 02:34:49.440]  which I don't know if you caught.
[02:34:49.440 --> 02:34:50.440]  It went by very quickly.
[02:34:50.440 --> 02:34:52.440]  I didn't catch it the first time.
[02:34:52.440 --> 02:34:57.440]  Obama mentioned the pushing for the Trans-Pacific Trade Agreement.
[02:34:57.440 --> 02:35:01.440]  No, no, I did, and these new global job zones work.
[02:35:01.440 --> 02:35:06.440]  I've got to tell you, this is something that has to be stopped
[02:35:06.440 --> 02:35:10.440]  because this is the way that world government comes about,
[02:35:10.440 --> 02:35:17.440]  and every one of these so-called free trade agreements is anything but free trade.
[02:35:17.440 --> 02:35:18.440]  Every one of them has been a disaster.
[02:35:18.440 --> 02:35:21.440]  Oh, they're one-sided deals where only insiders can operate,
[02:35:21.440 --> 02:35:24.440]  as you and Dr. Corsi have really been at the head.
[02:35:24.440 --> 02:35:28.440]  WorldNetDaily has been at the very head of shooting down
[02:35:28.440 --> 02:35:31.440]  so many of these power grabs at the Napa superhighways,
[02:35:31.440 --> 02:35:32.440]  but it doesn't matter.
[02:35:32.440 --> 02:35:34.440]  They just come back again.
[02:35:34.440 --> 02:35:35.440]  That's right.
[02:35:35.440 --> 02:35:37.440]  It's the exact opposite of what our policy should be.
[02:35:37.440 --> 02:35:40.440]  Our policy should be, you know, the way the government used to raise money,
[02:35:40.440 --> 02:35:42.440]  through tariffs.
[02:35:42.440 --> 02:35:45.440]  We have foreigners pay our government bills,
[02:35:45.440 --> 02:35:48.440]  and it keeps the government bills under control that way,
[02:35:48.440 --> 02:35:50.440]  not direct taxation through the people,
[02:35:50.440 --> 02:35:55.440]  not borrowing money endlessly from banks and from foreign countries.
[02:35:55.440 --> 02:35:58.440]  Let them pay to get into your marketplace,
[02:35:58.440 --> 02:36:01.440]  and the other countries can do it as well.
[02:36:01.440 --> 02:36:05.440]  Well, plus, we can't compete with Al Gore running factories,
[02:36:05.440 --> 02:36:07.440]  literally, that have suicide nets around them.
[02:36:07.440 --> 02:36:08.440]  Exactly.
[02:36:08.440 --> 02:36:11.440]  And they work 18 hours a day, and it's not even helping the Chinese.
[02:36:11.440 --> 02:36:13.440]  It's like we're lowering down to their standard.
[02:36:13.440 --> 02:36:15.440]  I'll put an image up for TV viewers.
[02:36:15.440 --> 02:36:17.440]  I don't usually get into comedy, folks,
[02:36:17.440 --> 02:36:19.440]  but I'm doing it more and more or I'm going to go insane.
[02:36:19.440 --> 02:36:20.440]  So I've just got to have fun with this.
[02:36:20.440 --> 02:36:22.440]  I'm not going to be angry like I've always been,
[02:36:22.440 --> 02:36:25.440]  at least all the time, because my health, I can't do it.
[02:36:25.440 --> 02:36:28.440]  What is Boner, his real name, what is John Boner,
[02:36:28.440 --> 02:36:33.440]  what is he doing with like a flying saucered lazy Susan
[02:36:33.440 --> 02:36:36.440]  with salt and pepper shakers and drinks and things?
[02:36:36.440 --> 02:36:39.440]  I mean, I've never seen him where it looks like he's eating a steak or something.
[02:36:39.440 --> 02:36:42.440]  He has like some kind of weird high-tech,
[02:36:42.440 --> 02:36:45.440]  you know, like you'd see in a diner or something in the middle of the table.
[02:36:45.440 --> 02:36:49.440]  Did you notice that?
[02:36:49.440 --> 02:36:50.440]  What the hell?
[02:36:50.440 --> 02:36:52.440]  I wish I could see the TV.
[02:36:52.440 --> 02:36:54.440]  I'm not watching it right now.
[02:36:54.440 --> 02:36:56.440]  Well, just go look at the State of the Union,
[02:36:56.440 --> 02:36:59.440]  and then hiding in plain view, it's like, you know,
[02:36:59.440 --> 02:37:02.440]  they've got a rim up there, so they can have their glasses down below,
[02:37:02.440 --> 02:37:04.440]  but they always set them up on top,
[02:37:04.440 --> 02:37:09.440]  and then Boehner is sitting there with some giant silver thing,
[02:37:09.440 --> 02:37:11.440]  it looks like, with like salt and pepper shakers in it.
[02:37:11.440 --> 02:37:14.440]  I don't know, it's just weird.
[02:37:14.440 --> 02:37:17.440]  Everything's getting weirder by the minute.
[02:37:17.440 --> 02:37:18.440]  Unbelievable.
[02:37:18.440 --> 02:37:21.440]  Well, the real contrast in that speech,
[02:37:21.440 --> 02:37:24.440]  and I wish everyone could have watched it the way I did,
[02:37:24.440 --> 02:37:28.440]  which was on Bing, where you saw the public's reaction
[02:37:28.440 --> 02:37:32.440]  versus the reaction from inside the House and Senate,
[02:37:32.440 --> 02:37:34.440]  including both Republicans and Democrats,
[02:37:34.440 --> 02:37:38.440]  there was an awful lot of applauding going on by Republicans in there,
[02:37:38.440 --> 02:37:41.440]  and yet you look at the reaction of the American people,
[02:37:41.440 --> 02:37:43.440]  and it was just the opposite.
[02:37:43.440 --> 02:37:46.440]  They're wondering, what is all this applause about?
[02:37:46.440 --> 02:37:49.440]  We don't like the direction of the country right now,
[02:37:49.440 --> 02:37:54.440]  and they're applauding not just a continuation on this road,
[02:37:54.440 --> 02:37:58.440]  but an acceleration on this path to destruction.
[02:37:58.440 --> 02:38:02.440]  But they're just going to keep telling us the recession ended four years ago.
[02:38:02.440 --> 02:38:03.440]  Everything is wonderful.
[02:38:03.440 --> 02:38:05.440]  We've never been at war with Eurasia.
[02:38:05.440 --> 02:38:06.440]  The stock market is up.
[02:38:06.440 --> 02:38:08.440]  Big Brother loves you, which it's up,
[02:38:08.440 --> 02:38:11.440]  because it's got deflated, devalued dollars,
[02:38:11.440 --> 02:38:15.440]  and now they're admitting he's doubled the debt in the last four years.
[02:38:15.440 --> 02:38:16.440]  They're devaluing the dollar.
[02:38:16.440 --> 02:38:19.440]  I guess that's what they're getting the bullets ready for,
[02:38:19.440 --> 02:38:21.440]  is I guess they think when everything collapses,
[02:38:21.440 --> 02:38:23.440]  which is more and more looks like it's going to happen,
[02:38:23.440 --> 02:38:27.440]  they just think a 1.7 billion bullets is going to,
[02:38:27.440 --> 02:38:28.440]  what is that going to do?
[02:38:28.440 --> 02:38:35.440]  I can tell you how many off-the-record yet substantive sources
[02:38:35.440 --> 02:38:36.440]  have told me just that.
[02:38:36.440 --> 02:38:42.440]  I wish I could quote the people who were telling me,
[02:38:42.440 --> 02:38:44.440]  but you know how that is.
[02:38:44.440 --> 02:38:46.440]  As a journalist, you can't do it.
[02:38:46.440 --> 02:38:51.440]  But over and over again, that's what I'm hearing from military people,
[02:38:51.440 --> 02:38:57.440]  from intelligence experts, that they are expecting a total collapse,
[02:38:57.440 --> 02:39:01.440]  and that's what this armament by the federal government is all about.
[02:39:01.440 --> 02:39:03.440]  That's what the gun confiscation is all about.
[02:39:03.440 --> 02:39:12.440]  They want to be able to control it all, which to us means, of course, tyranny.
[02:39:12.440 --> 02:39:14.440]  And of course, they engineered the whole thing,
[02:39:14.440 --> 02:39:16.440]  and we're the ones pointing out that it was all leading to this,
[02:39:16.440 --> 02:39:19.440]  Ron Paul and others, but still, we're going to be the bad guys,
[02:39:19.440 --> 02:39:22.440]  even though we said, hey, this is being done on purpose.
[02:39:22.440 --> 02:39:24.440]  They're steering us towards an iceberg.
[02:39:24.440 --> 02:39:26.440]  Let's play this really chilling clip.
[02:39:26.440 --> 02:39:29.440]  He said this several times on cybersecurity, you name it,
[02:39:29.440 --> 02:39:35.440]  where if we don't basically go along,
[02:39:35.440 --> 02:39:38.440]  well, I mean, you saw the clips where he said on cybersecurity
[02:39:38.440 --> 02:39:41.440]  and other issues that he'll just do what he wants.
[02:39:41.440 --> 02:39:44.440]  I mean, again, here's that clip.
[02:39:44.440 --> 02:39:45.440]  I'm sorry.
[02:39:45.440 --> 02:39:47.440]  Go ahead, Joe.
[02:39:47.440 --> 02:39:52.440]  No, I was going to say, do you think he's going to be protecting your website
[02:39:52.440 --> 02:39:55.440]  and my website from cybersecurity attacks?
[02:39:55.440 --> 02:39:58.440]  I think his protection is going to be very selective.
[02:39:58.440 --> 02:40:01.440]  And let's face it, the federal government is no good at any of this anyway.
[02:40:01.440 --> 02:40:05.440]  They can't even protect the Defense Department's own computers.
[02:40:05.440 --> 02:40:10.440]  So now they're going to protect corporations' infrastructure?
[02:40:10.440 --> 02:40:13.440]  It makes no sense.
[02:40:13.440 --> 02:40:14.440]  Do we have that clip ready?
[02:40:14.440 --> 02:40:15.440]  Is it time now?
[02:40:15.440 --> 02:40:17.440]  Can we play it?
[02:40:17.440 --> 02:40:19.440]  No, no, I want to go to that clip.
[02:40:19.440 --> 02:40:20.440]  Here we go.
[02:40:20.440 --> 02:40:22.440]  Now, the good news is we can make meaningful progress on this issue
[02:40:22.440 --> 02:40:26.440]  while driving strong economic growth.
[02:40:26.440 --> 02:40:28.440]  I urge this Congress to get together,
[02:40:28.440 --> 02:40:31.440]  pursue a bipartisan market-based solution to climate change,
[02:40:31.440 --> 02:40:36.440]  like the one John McCain and Joe Lieberman worked on together a few years ago.
[02:40:36.440 --> 02:40:42.440]  But if Congress won't act soon to protect future generations, I will.
[02:40:42.440 --> 02:40:49.440]  I will direct my Cabinet to come up with executive actions
[02:40:49.440 --> 02:40:52.440]  we can take now and in the future to reduce pollution,
[02:40:52.440 --> 02:40:56.440]  prepare our communities for the consequences of climate change,
[02:40:56.440 --> 02:40:59.440]  and speed the transition to more sustainable sources of energy.
[02:40:59.440 --> 02:41:00.440]  That's enough.
[02:41:00.440 --> 02:41:04.440]  Now, the good news is we can make meaningful progress on this issue
[02:41:04.440 --> 02:41:07.440]  while driving strong economic growth.
[02:41:07.440 --> 02:41:10.440]  Another low point in the public reaction during that speech
[02:41:10.440 --> 02:41:14.440]  was when he hit the climate change soundbite.
[02:41:14.440 --> 02:41:16.440]  People don't believe this.
[02:41:16.440 --> 02:41:20.440]  They know it's a hoax, and they reacted.
[02:41:20.440 --> 02:41:24.440]  I'm talking about Democrats as well as Republicans and independents.
[02:41:24.440 --> 02:41:27.440]  They just voted negative, negative, negative,
[02:41:27.440 --> 02:41:31.440]  and his ratings during that whole part of the speech
[02:41:31.440 --> 02:41:33.440]  plummeted to the bottom of the pile.
[02:41:33.440 --> 02:41:35.440]  That and gun control.
[02:41:35.440 --> 02:41:40.440]  Those are two very, very unpopular themes, yet they keep on pushing them.
[02:41:40.440 --> 02:41:42.440]  Now, I think it's the same old thing,
[02:41:42.440 --> 02:41:46.440]  because what is this climate change thing all about?
[02:41:46.440 --> 02:41:49.440]  It's about only the government can take care of this, right?
[02:41:49.440 --> 02:41:54.440]  The government is personally going to have an imaginary problem.
[02:41:54.440 --> 02:41:56.440]  This one they didn't even create.
[02:41:56.440 --> 02:42:00.440]  They just invented it, and the answer, of course,
[02:42:00.440 --> 02:42:05.440]  is basically taking all the control of the means of production
[02:42:05.440 --> 02:42:08.440]  and everything out of the hands of ordinary people
[02:42:08.440 --> 02:42:12.440]  and putting it in the hands of the bureaucracy.
[02:42:12.440 --> 02:42:14.440]  Joseph Farah of Roll Net Daily is our guest.
[02:42:14.440 --> 02:42:16.440]  I'm going to let him go ahead and get back to the work he's got to do.
[02:42:16.440 --> 02:42:20.440]  We'll take a few calls and play some more clips from State of the Union coming up.
[02:42:20.440 --> 02:42:23.440]  Bringing jobs home means global centers for high-tech jobs,
[02:42:23.440 --> 02:42:27.440]  15 zones in the U.S., which they'll exempt from taxes and regulations,
[02:42:27.440 --> 02:42:29.440]  but only insiders get to be part of it.
[02:42:29.440 --> 02:42:32.440]  I mean, this is just the ultimate form of discrimination.
[02:42:32.440 --> 02:42:35.440]  Isn't that what globalism is, is picking winners and losers?
[02:42:35.440 --> 02:42:39.440]  So they want us to obsess on black and white or this group, that group,
[02:42:39.440 --> 02:42:43.440]  northern, southerner, westerner, while really it's about globalists
[02:42:43.440 --> 02:42:46.440]  who write the rules and then exempt themselves from it?
[02:42:46.440 --> 02:42:48.440]  I mean, it's so obvious.
[02:42:48.440 --> 02:42:54.440]  It's so obvious that they want to divide us at home and unite us around the world.
[02:42:54.440 --> 02:42:58.440]  You know, it's a total contradiction no matter how you look at it.
[02:42:58.440 --> 02:43:02.440]  But that's the path we're on,
[02:43:02.440 --> 02:43:10.440]  and it's up to the people to start to get it and start to resist.
[02:43:10.440 --> 02:43:12.440]  But, I mean, there's so many scandals in closing.
[02:43:12.440 --> 02:43:15.440]  We've got Fast and Furious, you've got Solyndra,
[02:43:15.440 --> 02:43:20.440]  you've got the military being told that they're under the control of NATO.
[02:43:20.440 --> 02:43:23.440]  In the U.N., you've got the government funding Al-Qaeda now
[02:43:23.440 --> 02:43:25.440]  and even General Boykin coming out against it.
[02:43:25.440 --> 02:43:29.440]  All this stuff going on, the purges at CENTCOM, purges everywhere.
[02:43:29.440 --> 02:43:33.440]  I mean, historically, it's got all the signs of teetering on the edge,
[02:43:33.440 --> 02:43:35.440]  but the Republicans don't want to push it over the edge
[02:43:35.440 --> 02:43:38.440]  because they're bought and paid for by the same gangsters.
[02:43:38.440 --> 02:43:44.440]  Let's not forget the targeted assassinations of American citizens.
[02:43:44.440 --> 02:43:50.440]  It starts with a guy who's obviously not popular with anybody in the American public,
[02:43:50.440 --> 02:43:53.440]  a guy who's got some unseemly connections.
[02:43:53.440 --> 02:43:58.440]  So you whack him and you get away with it.
[02:43:58.440 --> 02:44:06.440]  Well, the next thing you know, you can take out Alex Jones or somebody like us.
[02:44:06.440 --> 02:44:10.440]  The president is there.
[02:44:10.440 --> 02:44:14.440]  Do you think the Chris Kyle sniper getting killed that way,
[02:44:14.440 --> 02:44:16.440]  in all the different stories, a little suspicious,
[02:44:16.440 --> 02:44:21.440]  it's just really weird that that guy would get killed?
[02:44:21.440 --> 02:44:22.440]  Well, yeah.
[02:44:22.440 --> 02:44:25.440]  I mean, they had him surrounded.
[02:44:25.440 --> 02:44:31.440]  It's kind of reminiscent of, well, it might be a bit of a stretch,
[02:44:31.440 --> 02:44:37.440]  but Waco, Ruby Ridge back in the day,
[02:44:37.440 --> 02:44:42.440]  if government has all this force on its side,
[02:44:42.440 --> 02:44:46.440]  why does it have to resort to killing all the time?
[02:44:46.440 --> 02:44:48.440]  Why is that always the solution?
[02:44:48.440 --> 02:44:51.440]  Why not be able to take this guy alive?
[02:44:51.440 --> 02:44:52.440]  You're talking about Chris Dorner.
[02:44:52.440 --> 02:44:54.440]  It's just amazing.
[02:44:54.440 --> 02:44:56.440]  All right, well, we'll talk to you again soon.
[02:44:56.440 --> 02:44:58.440]  Joseph Farah, thanks for spending time with us.
[02:44:58.440 --> 02:44:59.440]  All right, God bless.
[02:44:59.440 --> 02:45:01.440]  There he goes, powerful interview with Joseph Farah.
[02:45:01.440 --> 02:45:03.440]  I want to jam in some phone calls now.
[02:45:03.440 --> 02:45:06.440]  We've got a bunch of clips here from the State of the Union.
[02:45:06.440 --> 02:45:10.440]  Bringing jobs home means global centers for high tech jobs,
[02:45:10.440 --> 02:45:14.440]  15 zones in the US, and it just goes on and on.
[02:45:14.440 --> 02:45:16.440]  If the Congress doesn't pass green tyranny, then he'll do it.
[02:45:16.440 --> 02:45:17.440]  We already covered that.
[02:45:17.440 --> 02:45:20.440]  Let's cut our energy in half in the next 20 years.
[02:45:20.440 --> 02:45:21.440]  That's a quote.
[02:45:21.440 --> 02:45:23.440]  I mean, let's cut our energy.
[02:45:23.440 --> 02:45:25.440]  China can have all at once.
[02:45:25.440 --> 02:45:26.440]  India can have all at once.
[02:45:26.440 --> 02:45:28.440]  Mexico can have all at once.
[02:45:28.440 --> 02:45:30.440]  We've got all these third world countries,
[02:45:30.440 --> 02:45:34.440]  but your energy's gonna be way more expensive.
[02:45:34.440 --> 02:45:36.440]  I mean, that will shut us down.
[02:45:36.440 --> 02:45:39.440]  I mean, it's a simple two plus two equals four.
[02:45:39.440 --> 02:45:41.440]  Transatlantic Euro Trade Partnership,
[02:45:41.440 --> 02:45:43.440]  that's Bilderberg, New World Order, UN.
[02:45:43.440 --> 02:45:46.440]  Protect the children, gun violence, this time is different.
[02:45:46.440 --> 02:45:48.440]  Overwhelming amount of Americans are coming together
[02:45:48.440 --> 02:45:51.440]  isn't actually what's true.
[02:45:51.440 --> 02:45:54.440]  The story about Sandy Hook victims who sang for Obama
[02:45:54.440 --> 02:45:58.440]  a week before, repeats the deserve a vote many times.
[02:45:58.440 --> 02:46:00.440]  I mean, it just goes on and on,
[02:46:00.440 --> 02:46:02.440]  but we're gonna get to that in a moment.
[02:46:02.440 --> 02:46:04.440]  Let's talk to Steve in Illinois.
[02:46:04.440 --> 02:46:05.440]  Steve, thanks for holding.
[02:46:05.440 --> 02:46:06.440]  You're a trooper.
[02:46:06.440 --> 02:46:07.440]  You're on the air.
[02:46:07.440 --> 02:46:08.440]  Welcome.
[02:46:08.440 --> 02:46:10.440]  Well, I don't mind it because I remember
[02:46:10.440 --> 02:46:12.440]  before you had an Infowars site.
[02:46:12.440 --> 02:46:15.440]  I've been following you that long.
[02:46:15.440 --> 02:46:19.440]  The thing is is that it's Morgental.
[02:46:19.440 --> 02:46:22.440]  He needs to change his tune from God Save the Queen
[02:46:22.440 --> 02:46:23.440]  to Yankee Doodle Dandy.
[02:46:23.440 --> 02:46:25.440]  We're not under British mandate,
[02:46:25.440 --> 02:46:28.440]  and he's not gonna enact any coercion acts
[02:46:28.440 --> 02:46:32.440]  or dangerous association acts
[02:46:32.440 --> 02:46:36.440]  or Bloody Trafalgar Square
[02:46:36.440 --> 02:46:40.440]  or Welsh Tony Pandy, Scottish Highland Clearances.
[02:46:40.440 --> 02:46:42.440]  I'm not gonna go through everything.
[02:46:42.440 --> 02:46:46.440]  But the point is, General Colin Pollups,
[02:46:46.440 --> 02:46:49.440]  he's inciting and agitating these Negroes
[02:46:49.440 --> 02:46:51.440]  by saying there's a black bane,
[02:46:51.440 --> 02:46:54.440]  what was it, dark bane of racism in the Republic?
[02:46:54.440 --> 02:46:55.440]  I remember you.
[02:46:55.440 --> 02:46:58.440]  You have been calling for about 15 years or 16 years.
[02:46:58.440 --> 02:47:02.440]  You always call in and talk about black people, right?
[02:47:02.440 --> 02:47:04.440]  You've been listening like 16 years, haven't you?
[02:47:04.440 --> 02:47:07.440]  Yes, I've been listening, well, yeah, a few years.
[02:47:07.440 --> 02:47:08.440]  Yeah, several years.
[02:47:08.440 --> 02:47:11.440]  Yeah, you haven't gotten into the show in a couple years.
[02:47:11.440 --> 02:47:13.440]  Well, that might be true.
[02:47:13.440 --> 02:47:14.440]  But the thing is-
[02:47:14.440 --> 02:47:17.440]  No, but I mean, the issue is it's not black, white, though.
[02:47:17.440 --> 02:47:21.440]  They're trying to organize that and get that stirred up.
[02:47:21.440 --> 02:47:25.440]  I mean, halfway I remember your phone calls.
[02:47:25.440 --> 02:47:26.440]  Go ahead and finish your point.
[02:47:26.440 --> 02:47:27.440]  No, no, no.
[02:47:27.440 --> 02:47:30.440]  Same thing with Jesse James Jackson Jr.
[02:47:30.440 --> 02:47:33.440]  He's the guy who's pleading insanity now
[02:47:33.440 --> 02:47:35.440]  to avoid federal prison
[02:47:35.440 --> 02:47:37.440]  because he was insane at the time of the crimes
[02:47:37.440 --> 02:47:39.440]  he hasn't been charged with, but he's going to be.
[02:47:39.440 --> 02:47:42.440]  But they have attacked the whites and-
[02:47:42.440 --> 02:47:45.440]  How many Pollups does Colin Powell have?
[02:47:45.440 --> 02:47:46.440]  Pardon?
[02:47:46.440 --> 02:47:47.440]  In his colon.
[02:47:47.440 --> 02:47:50.440]  Colin Powell, how many Pollups does he have?
[02:47:50.440 --> 02:47:53.440]  He needs a Squatty Potty, our new sponsor.
[02:47:53.440 --> 02:47:56.440]  Sir, let me ask you a question.
[02:47:56.440 --> 02:47:57.440]  Do you have a Squatty Potty?
[02:47:57.440 --> 02:48:00.440]  I don't want to check his stool specimen.
[02:48:00.440 --> 02:48:02.440]  That's enough.
[02:48:02.440 --> 02:48:04.440]  Folks, I'm sorry I've been screwing around
[02:48:04.440 --> 02:48:05.440]  and joking more and more on air.
[02:48:05.440 --> 02:48:07.440]  It's just I've reached a point.
[02:48:07.440 --> 02:48:09.440]  Get it off the screen.
[02:48:09.440 --> 02:48:10.440]  Get it off.
[02:48:10.440 --> 02:48:12.440]  Earlier I hear this ad on the network.
[02:48:12.440 --> 02:48:13.440]  I'm like, what is that?
[02:48:13.440 --> 02:48:15.440]  And then it turns into this big debate.
[02:48:15.440 --> 02:48:18.440]  Chris is like, it's actually quite healthy.
[02:48:18.440 --> 02:48:21.440]  It's hilarious.
[02:48:21.440 --> 02:48:24.440]  And invariably the camping stories begin.
[02:48:24.440 --> 02:48:27.440]  Look, the whole point here is this place is out of control.
[02:48:27.440 --> 02:48:30.440]  We have uploaded my visit to the biggest grocery store,
[02:48:30.440 --> 02:48:35.440]  excuse me, biggest gas station in the world.
[02:48:35.440 --> 02:48:38.440]  And it's an important piece and Piers Morgan appears
[02:48:38.440 --> 02:48:40.440]  and it is up at Infowars.com right now.
[02:48:40.440 --> 02:48:44.440]  See folks, the problem is you've heard Kevin Booth before
[02:48:44.440 --> 02:48:48.440]  who produced Bill Hicks say that I'm very funny in private.
[02:48:48.440 --> 02:48:50.440]  And I'm not saying I'm actually that funny.
[02:48:50.440 --> 02:48:52.440]  He thinks I'm funny.
[02:48:52.440 --> 02:48:54.440]  And Joe Rogan thinks I'm funny in private
[02:48:54.440 --> 02:48:55.440]  and has said I'm very funny.
[02:48:55.440 --> 02:48:56.440]  What's happening is I'm actually acting
[02:48:56.440 --> 02:48:58.440]  like I really do in real life here
[02:48:58.440 --> 02:49:01.440]  and this needs to stop right now.
[02:49:01.440 --> 02:49:04.440]  I just have kind of turned into like Daffy Duck or something.
[02:49:04.440 --> 02:49:05.440]  What's going on, dude?
[02:49:05.440 --> 02:49:08.440]  You're standing there like it's an important message.
[02:49:08.440 --> 02:49:11.440]  Is it a message from Klandathu?
[02:49:11.440 --> 02:49:13.440]  Is it important?
[02:49:13.440 --> 02:49:16.440]  It's for after the show.
[02:49:16.440 --> 02:49:20.440]  You like shooting the firearms yesterday, Joe?
[02:49:20.440 --> 02:49:22.440]  You won't get to shoot firearms much anymore
[02:49:22.440 --> 02:49:26.440]  if they have their way, but they don't want our guns.
[02:49:26.440 --> 02:49:28.440]  All right, enough of that.
[02:49:28.440 --> 02:49:31.440]  Nick in Pennsylvania, you're on the air, sir.
[02:49:31.440 --> 02:49:33.440]  Go ahead.
[02:49:33.440 --> 02:49:36.440]  Alex, first I wanted to say on this Valentine's Day,
[02:49:36.440 --> 02:49:40.440]  God bless you and your whole staff and all your guests.
[02:49:40.440 --> 02:49:42.440]  Thank you, sir.
[02:49:42.440 --> 02:49:46.440]  And also, it's a pleasure to talk to you.
[02:49:46.440 --> 02:49:48.440]  It's a pleasure to talk to you, my friend.
[02:49:48.440 --> 02:49:49.440]  Thank you.
[02:49:49.440 --> 02:49:52.440]  And I just wanted to say that,
[02:49:52.440 --> 02:49:56.440]  are you familiar with Gregor Mandel?
[02:49:56.440 --> 02:49:57.440]  You know, that kind of rings a bell.
[02:49:57.440 --> 02:49:58.440]  How do you...
[02:49:58.440 --> 02:50:01.440]  McGregor Mandel?
[02:50:01.440 --> 02:50:03.440]  Yeah, Gregor Mandel.
[02:50:03.440 --> 02:50:04.440]  No, tell me about it.
[02:50:04.440 --> 02:50:05.440]  Okay.
[02:50:05.440 --> 02:50:09.440]  Gregor Mandel was the pioneer research scientist
[02:50:09.440 --> 02:50:15.440]  that crossed pea plants and helped figure out DNA structure
[02:50:15.440 --> 02:50:16.440]  and that sort of thing.
[02:50:16.440 --> 02:50:17.440]  Oh, yes, I am aware of him.
[02:50:17.440 --> 02:50:18.440]  That's why it rung a bell.
[02:50:18.440 --> 02:50:20.440]  Yes, I remember reading about him.
[02:50:20.440 --> 02:50:21.440]  Okay.
[02:50:21.440 --> 02:50:24.440]  Well, I myself am a pioneer research scientist
[02:50:24.440 --> 02:50:26.440]  and I'm kind of like Gregor Mandel.
[02:50:26.440 --> 02:50:31.440]  And see, as far as the GMOs, this should not be going on.
[02:50:31.440 --> 02:50:34.440]  You don't mess around with DNA.
[02:50:34.440 --> 02:50:38.440]  And this, they don't realize the problems
[02:50:38.440 --> 02:50:39.440]  they're creating.
[02:50:39.440 --> 02:50:40.440]  Oh, you know what?
[02:50:40.440 --> 02:50:41.440]  I think they do.
[02:50:41.440 --> 02:50:42.440]  I've had their top scientists on.
[02:50:42.440 --> 02:50:43.440]  They admit they can change one thing,
[02:50:43.440 --> 02:50:46.440]  but then it randomly changes a bunch of other stuff
[02:50:46.440 --> 02:50:48.440]  and it's extremely dangerous.
[02:50:48.440 --> 02:50:49.440]  Absolutely.
[02:50:49.440 --> 02:50:50.440]  It is dangerous.
[02:50:50.440 --> 02:50:55.440]  And see, this is some of the things that mainstream media won't talk to you.
[02:50:55.440 --> 02:50:58.440]  And by the way, I thank you so much, Alex,
[02:50:58.440 --> 02:51:02.440]  for letting me talk to here an independent scientist
[02:51:02.440 --> 02:51:05.440]  that's against this evil science that they're doing.
[02:51:05.440 --> 02:51:10.440]  And one of the things that they're doing with this genetically modified stuff
[02:51:10.440 --> 02:51:14.440]  is they're telling, well, by doing this,
[02:51:14.440 --> 02:51:18.440]  we can spray less pesticides on the crops.
[02:51:18.440 --> 02:51:19.440]  And you know what?
[02:51:19.440 --> 02:51:21.440]  That is true.
[02:51:21.440 --> 02:51:27.440]  However, what they're not telling people is by doing what they're doing,
[02:51:27.440 --> 02:51:35.440]  the plant itself produces toxins that kill those pests.
[02:51:35.440 --> 02:51:40.440]  I read a Washington Post headline about farmers not creating enough safe zones
[02:51:40.440 --> 02:51:43.440]  for insects just a few months ago
[02:51:43.440 --> 02:51:46.440]  because they have to plant crops just for the insects to eat
[02:51:46.440 --> 02:51:50.440]  that aren't GMO with the BT because it grows its own poison
[02:51:50.440 --> 02:51:52.440]  so the bugs can't eat it, but then we're supposed to eat it
[02:51:52.440 --> 02:51:54.440]  and then wonder why all these disorders are happening.
[02:51:54.440 --> 02:51:56.440]  You're absolutely right.
[02:51:56.440 --> 02:51:57.440]  And that's what's so crazy.
[02:51:57.440 --> 02:52:01.440]  That's why everything has just become so insane.
[02:52:01.440 --> 02:52:05.440]  And when you're informed, you can't believe how nuts it's already gotten
[02:52:05.440 --> 02:52:09.440]  and you know it's just going to get crazier and crazier and crazier.
[02:52:09.440 --> 02:52:11.440]  And look, the elite know what they're doing.
[02:52:11.440 --> 02:52:14.440]  They've got underground seed vaults and bunkers and they're all dug in
[02:52:14.440 --> 02:52:17.440]  and they have their own non-GMO greenhouses
[02:52:17.440 --> 02:52:21.440]  and from the communist Chinese to the British royalty to the American elite.
[02:52:21.440 --> 02:52:25.440]  I've done whole pieces on that where they all are obsessed on non-GMO,
[02:52:25.440 --> 02:52:30.440]  all obsessed on pure water, rare earth minerals, I mean, all of it.
[02:52:30.440 --> 02:52:32.440]  They know what to do.
[02:52:32.440 --> 02:52:34.440]  I mean, this is a plan, sir.
[02:52:34.440 --> 02:52:36.440]  And see, so many scientists and doctors I have on, they go,
[02:52:36.440 --> 02:52:38.440]  I can't believe they know this.
[02:52:38.440 --> 02:52:40.440]  No, they're just stupid.
[02:52:40.440 --> 02:52:43.440]  I'm here to tell you, brother, they know exactly what they're doing.
[02:52:43.440 --> 02:52:47.440]  They are madmen.
[02:52:47.440 --> 02:52:50.440]  And when they release some horrible bioweapon,
[02:52:50.440 --> 02:52:52.440]  bi-action or whatever, they're not going to be able to put out a fake press release
[02:52:52.440 --> 02:52:54.440]  saying this didn't happen.
[02:52:54.440 --> 02:52:56.440]  The bioweapon isn't killing you.
[02:52:56.440 --> 02:52:58.440]  We didn't burn up Dorner.
[02:52:58.440 --> 02:53:00.440]  I didn't have sex with that woman.
[02:53:00.440 --> 02:53:02.440]  I'm a Nobel Peace Prize winner.
[02:53:02.440 --> 02:53:04.440]  This attack on Libya is not a war.
[02:53:04.440 --> 02:53:07.440]  Their baloney isn't going to work anymore.
[02:53:07.440 --> 02:53:10.440]  And my goal is for everybody to have a happier life,
[02:53:10.440 --> 02:53:15.440]  freer, more reality, live longer, have a great family.
[02:53:15.440 --> 02:53:17.440]  I don't care what color, religion.
[02:53:17.440 --> 02:53:20.440]  I don't think I have to lose something for you to gain.
[02:53:20.440 --> 02:53:22.440]  I know we can build the pie.
[02:53:22.440 --> 02:53:25.440]  I know we have unlimited potential.
[02:53:25.440 --> 02:53:27.440]  And I'm just so sick of it.
[02:53:27.440 --> 02:53:29.440]  And they're beating the racism drum
[02:53:29.440 --> 02:53:32.440]  and doing horrible things to white people now
[02:53:32.440 --> 02:53:37.440]  to try to get white people to hate other quote groups of other people.
[02:53:37.440 --> 02:53:39.440]  And it's the same thing back and forth.
[02:53:39.440 --> 02:53:42.440]  And it's desperate divide and conquer.
[02:53:42.440 --> 02:53:45.440]  While the real discrimination is the mega banks
[02:53:45.440 --> 02:53:48.440]  exempting themselves from all the taxes they put on us
[02:53:48.440 --> 02:53:50.440]  to destroy us financially
[02:53:50.440 --> 02:53:53.440]  and transferring our money to themselves in corporate welfare.
[02:53:53.440 --> 02:53:55.440]  That is the big sin.
[02:53:55.440 --> 02:53:59.440]  I'm going to go to Rob and Bob and Frank and Randy
[02:53:59.440 --> 02:54:01.440]  here in just a moment.
[02:54:01.440 --> 02:54:02.440]  But right now, let's start playing some of these clips.
[02:54:02.440 --> 02:54:03.440]  Here's clip one.
[02:54:03.440 --> 02:54:07.440]  Bringing jobs home means global centers for high-tech jobs,
[02:54:07.440 --> 02:54:09.440]  15 zones in the U.S.
[02:54:09.440 --> 02:54:13.440]  They don't tell you the same stuff that wrecked Jamaica, you name it.
[02:54:13.440 --> 02:54:18.440]  These are zones where no one else can operate.
[02:54:18.440 --> 02:54:21.440]  And the zones are exempt from taxes and regulations.
[02:54:21.440 --> 02:54:23.440]  Jamaica was a great place till they did this.
[02:54:23.440 --> 02:54:24.440]  It's happened everywhere.
[02:54:24.440 --> 02:54:26.440]  I mean, this is the globalist plan.
[02:54:26.440 --> 02:54:28.440]  It's not like this is my opinion.
[02:54:28.440 --> 02:54:30.440]  But he's acting like, hey, things are bad.
[02:54:30.440 --> 02:54:32.440]  Obamacare will give you free care.
[02:54:32.440 --> 02:54:34.440]  Raises your taxes on poor people.
[02:54:34.440 --> 02:54:35.440]  I promise, no taxes on poor people.
[02:54:35.440 --> 02:54:36.440]  That's why it raises it on you.
[02:54:36.440 --> 02:54:38.440]  I promise, this is a real good deal for you.
[02:54:38.440 --> 02:54:39.440]  You're having trouble swimming?
[02:54:39.440 --> 02:54:41.440]  Here, let me chop your legs off.
[02:54:41.440 --> 02:54:42.440]  I don't care about you.
[02:54:42.440 --> 02:54:43.440]  I really do.
[02:54:43.440 --> 02:54:46.440]  Here is that clip from the state of the destruction of America.
[02:54:46.440 --> 02:54:47.440]  Here it is.
[02:54:47.440 --> 02:54:52.440]  So tonight, I'm announcing the launch of three more of these manufacturing hubs,
[02:54:52.440 --> 02:54:56.440]  where businesses will partner with the Department of Defense and Energy
[02:54:56.440 --> 02:55:01.440]  to turn regions left behind by globalization into global centers of high-tech jobs.
[02:55:01.440 --> 02:55:06.440]  And I ask this Congress to help create a network of 15 of these hubs
[02:55:06.440 --> 02:55:11.440]  and guarantee that the next revolution in manufacturing is made right here in America.
[02:55:11.440 --> 02:55:13.440]  Okay, the next revolution.
[02:55:13.440 --> 02:55:17.440]  See, take your liberty, take your jobs, offer you more tyranny.
[02:55:17.440 --> 02:55:19.440]  Another step down as the solution.
[02:55:19.440 --> 02:55:20.440]  Let's go to clip three.
[02:55:20.440 --> 02:55:23.440]  Let's cut our energy in half in the next 20 years.
[02:55:23.440 --> 02:55:26.440]  Oh, man, yeah, that's a really good idea.
[02:55:26.440 --> 02:55:27.440]  Let's go to that clip.
[02:55:27.440 --> 02:55:29.440]  I'm also issuing a new goal for America.
[02:55:29.440 --> 02:55:34.440]  Let's cut in half the energy wasted by our homes and businesses over the next 20 years.
[02:55:34.440 --> 02:55:36.440]  He doesn't mean cut wasted.
[02:55:36.440 --> 02:55:39.440]  He means he's going to increase the prices and cut off your power, period,
[02:55:39.440 --> 02:55:40.440]  except for government districts.
[02:55:40.440 --> 02:55:42.440]  Look at that pinhead holder.
[02:55:42.440 --> 02:55:44.440]  We'll work with the states to do it.
[02:55:44.440 --> 02:55:47.440]  Those states with the best ideas to create jobs and lower energy bills
[02:55:47.440 --> 02:55:52.440]  by constructing more efficient buildings will receive federal support to help make it happen.
[02:55:52.440 --> 02:55:54.440]  That means if you're insiders, you get all the free cash.
[02:55:54.440 --> 02:55:55.440]  If you're not?
[02:55:55.440 --> 02:56:00.440]  America's energy sector is just one part of an aging infrastructure badly in need of repairs.
[02:56:00.440 --> 02:56:02.440]  Yeah, it's aging, so you won't let us build anything new.
[02:56:02.440 --> 02:56:07.440]  Look at the sullenness of Obama.
[02:56:07.440 --> 02:56:13.440]  He really loves lying to you and conning you and the fact that you're so willing to be conned.
[02:56:13.440 --> 02:56:16.440]  How do people like $22,000 a year get your payroll tax raised?
[02:56:16.440 --> 02:56:18.440]  He promised he wasn't going to raise your taxes,
[02:56:18.440 --> 02:56:22.440]  promised he wasn't going to come for your guns either, but it doesn't matter, suckers.
[02:56:22.440 --> 02:56:24.440]  You're like, what, is Romney good?
[02:56:24.440 --> 02:56:25.440]  No, the whole thing was rigged.
[02:56:25.440 --> 02:56:30.440]  I don't like the fighter in the Don King fight that took the dive any more than I like the fake winner.
[02:56:30.440 --> 02:56:31.440]  Got it?
[02:56:31.440 --> 02:56:34.440]  The whole thing's a load of malarkey.
[02:56:34.440 --> 02:56:38.440]  Let's go to comprehensive immigration reform, total legalization,
[02:56:38.440 --> 02:56:41.440]  and the Republicans are running the hoax that, well, the mandate's there,
[02:56:41.440 --> 02:56:44.440]  and then the illegals will be legalized and we'll vote to take our guns.
[02:56:44.440 --> 02:56:46.440]  But that's okay, because who needs them?
[02:56:46.440 --> 02:56:47.440]  The government's going to protect us.
[02:56:47.440 --> 02:56:49.440]  Here's that clip.
[02:56:49.440 --> 02:56:56.440]  Our economy is stronger when we harness the talents and ingenuity of striving, hopeful immigrants.
[02:56:56.440 --> 02:57:04.440]  And right now, leaders from the business, labor, law enforcement, faith communities,
[02:57:04.440 --> 02:57:09.440]  they all agree that the time has come to pass comprehensive immigration reform.
[02:57:09.440 --> 02:57:10.440]  The bandwagon.
[02:57:10.440 --> 02:57:11.440]  How's the time to do it?
[02:57:11.440 --> 02:57:13.440]  And he goes on, it's a long clip, I won't have time to play it.
[02:57:13.440 --> 02:57:15.440]  The time has come to take your guns, but he doesn't want your guns,
[02:57:15.440 --> 02:57:19.440]  even though we have all the bills introduced at the states and already passed in New York,
[02:57:19.440 --> 02:57:23.440]  arresting people for above-10-round mags, felony charges.
[02:57:23.440 --> 02:57:24.440]  I mean, it's on.
[02:57:24.440 --> 02:57:25.440]  It's on.
[02:57:25.440 --> 02:57:30.440]  But you're just supposed to, it's all right, though, it's all right.
[02:57:30.440 --> 02:57:34.440]  Let's go ahead and go to Transatlantic Euro Trade Partnership,
[02:57:34.440 --> 02:57:39.440]  which, again, is merging all these governments in one-sided deals, 50,000 pages long sometimes,
[02:57:39.440 --> 02:57:41.440]  where all these insiders are tax-exempt.
[02:57:41.440 --> 02:57:45.440]  Great idea for you and your family, the ultra-rich, to be tax-exempt,
[02:57:45.440 --> 02:57:49.440]  while raising taxes on people making $22,000 a year because it's liberal.
[02:57:49.440 --> 02:57:52.440]  It's like, wait a minute, he's black and it's liberal.
[02:57:52.440 --> 02:57:53.440]  But he lied.
[02:57:53.440 --> 02:57:54.440]  It's liberal.
[02:57:54.440 --> 02:57:56.440]  Shut up, racist.
[02:57:56.440 --> 02:57:58.440]  But you raised it on poor black families.
[02:57:58.440 --> 02:58:00.440]  It's liberal.
[02:58:00.440 --> 02:58:01.440]  You're murdering blacks all over Africa.
[02:58:01.440 --> 02:58:02.440]  It's liberal.
[02:58:02.440 --> 02:58:04.440]  You're murdering people all over the Middle East.
[02:58:04.440 --> 02:58:05.440]  It's liberal.
[02:58:05.440 --> 02:58:06.440]  Listen, it's liberal.
[02:58:06.440 --> 02:58:08.440]  Let's go to this clip, Transatlantic Euro Trade Partnership.
[02:58:08.440 --> 02:58:09.440]  Here it is.
[02:58:09.440 --> 02:58:13.440]  We intend to complete negotiations on a Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[02:58:13.440 --> 02:58:14.440]  Oh, yeah.
[02:58:14.440 --> 02:58:17.440]  And tonight I'm announcing that we will launch talks on a comprehensive
[02:58:17.440 --> 02:58:21.440]  Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with the European Union.
[02:58:21.440 --> 02:58:22.440]  Oh, yeah.
[02:58:22.440 --> 02:58:25.440]  A trade that is fair and free across the Atlantic,
[02:58:25.440 --> 02:58:27.440]  supports millions of good-paying American jobs.
[02:58:27.440 --> 02:58:28.440]  Oh, boy.
[02:58:28.440 --> 02:58:29.440]  Goody, goody.
[02:58:29.440 --> 02:58:32.440]  I'm sure that will be a good deal.
[02:58:32.440 --> 02:58:36.440]  I will not raise your taxes, not $1, not your payroll tax,
[02:58:36.440 --> 02:58:39.440]  not your Social Security tax, none of your taxes.
[02:58:39.440 --> 02:58:42.440]  I won't take your guns either.

[03:00:17.440 --> 03:00:24.440]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:24.440 --> 03:00:26.440]  All right, I appreciate you holding so long.
[03:00:26.440 --> 03:00:29.440]  Rob in New Hampshire, we're in overdrive for you.
[03:00:29.440 --> 03:00:31.440]  Rob, you're on the air. You want to talk about a fake outbreak?
[03:00:31.440 --> 03:00:33.440]  Go ahead, sir.
[03:00:33.440 --> 03:00:39.440]  Yeah, Alex, I just want to first thank you profusely for my people
[03:00:39.440 --> 03:00:44.440]  for the work and the words and the publicity you've put out there
[03:00:44.440 --> 03:00:47.440]  for sexually abused children.
[03:00:47.440 --> 03:00:51.440]  You do more on the national and now the global level
[03:00:51.440 --> 03:00:55.440]  of raising awareness than I could ever hope to do
[03:00:55.440 --> 03:00:57.440]  doing this full-time.
[03:00:57.440 --> 03:00:59.440]  Well, thank you. We're just trying to expose that most,
[03:00:59.440 --> 03:01:03.440]  a large portion of the ruling class are child abusers
[03:01:03.440 --> 03:01:07.440]  and that's why they want power so they can get away with hurting kids.
[03:01:07.440 --> 03:01:10.440]  Exactly, and I've got studies that would curl your hair.
[03:01:10.440 --> 03:01:13.440]  But listen, what I wanted to do is tell you, years ago,
[03:01:13.440 --> 03:01:18.440]  I did a study with a major university while I was a grad student.
[03:01:18.440 --> 03:01:22.440]  We examined what would happen to the transportation system
[03:01:22.440 --> 03:01:31.440]  if an outbreak or just word of an outbreak of smallpox was publicized.
[03:01:31.440 --> 03:01:37.440]  If the new CNN and everybody said, we've got three minor outbreaks
[03:01:37.440 --> 03:01:42.440]  of smallpox in O'Hare, at LAX, at Kennedy,
[03:01:42.440 --> 03:01:45.440]  what would happen to transportation?
[03:01:45.440 --> 03:01:49.440]  And clearly transportation was going to break down,
[03:01:49.440 --> 03:01:52.440]  truckers weren't going to come to work, warehouse workers.
[03:01:52.440 --> 03:01:56.440]  Things will totally lock down if that happens,
[03:01:56.440 --> 03:01:59.440]  and that's what they're gearing up for is to lock things down
[03:01:59.440 --> 03:02:03.440]  or they use that crisis or whatever to teach us to learn tyranny
[03:02:03.440 --> 03:02:05.440]  and to learn that it's good.
[03:02:05.440 --> 03:02:09.440]  Exactly, and bankers will be coming in and payroll starts.
[03:02:09.440 --> 03:02:16.440]  Everybody will be staying home and it would be a bigger effect
[03:02:16.440 --> 03:02:19.440]  than a nuclear blast in one of our cities.
[03:02:19.440 --> 03:02:25.440]  It's frightening the chain reaction it will have if they decide to do it.
[03:02:25.440 --> 03:02:27.440]  Well, the point is, we can all speculate.
[03:02:27.440 --> 03:02:31.440]  We're up like it's the end of the world, all over the planet.
[03:02:31.440 --> 03:02:35.440]  And the end of the world is the giant Ponzi scheme is coming to a head
[03:02:35.440 --> 03:02:38.440]  and they plan to use that crisis to bring us into even greater tyranny.
[03:02:38.440 --> 03:02:41.440]  And we're struggling a bit here on the gurney
[03:02:41.440 --> 03:02:44.440]  while the vampire is trying to put his little fangs into our neck
[03:02:44.440 --> 03:02:46.440]  and it's just time to wake up, folks.
[03:02:46.440 --> 03:02:48.440]  God bless you, good to hear from you.
[03:02:48.440 --> 03:02:50.440]  Frank in Nevada, you're on the air.
[03:02:50.440 --> 03:02:53.440]  You want to talk about Dorner and the LAPD, go ahead.
[03:02:53.440 --> 03:02:55.440]  Yes, hi, Alex.
[03:02:55.440 --> 03:02:58.440]  I just wanted to say I'm calling as a private citizen.
[03:02:58.440 --> 03:03:02.440]  I'm active duty military, but I just wanted to say that it's wonderful
[03:03:02.440 --> 03:03:05.440]  how you are exercising your constitutional freedoms.
[03:03:05.440 --> 03:03:07.440]  You are why we do what we do.
[03:03:07.440 --> 03:03:09.440]  Well, God bless you, sir.
[03:03:09.440 --> 03:03:11.440]  What else did you want to add today?
[03:03:11.440 --> 03:03:15.440]  Okay, well, everybody keeps saying that they can't understand why Dorner,
[03:03:15.440 --> 03:03:18.440]  they can't understand why Dorner, they can't understand why Dorner,
[03:03:18.440 --> 03:03:20.440]  and I think he was the perfect rogue agent.
[03:03:20.440 --> 03:03:23.440]  I think he accomplished exactly what he was supposed to.
[03:03:23.440 --> 03:03:29.440]  First off, whether you think he's vilified or justified, it doesn't matter.
[03:03:29.440 --> 03:03:34.440]  He was entitled under the Constitution to a right to a fair trial
[03:03:34.440 --> 03:03:36.440]  by a jury of his peers and due process.
[03:03:36.440 --> 03:03:39.440]  Whether you agree with him or not doesn't matter.
[03:03:39.440 --> 03:03:41.440]  And the precedent's now set for them to say,
[03:03:41.440 --> 03:03:45.440]  we're going to kill him, then kill him and say nothing happened.
[03:03:45.440 --> 03:03:50.440]  Okay, now look at what the LAPD did, okay?
[03:03:50.440 --> 03:03:51.440]  He was one of their own.
[03:03:51.440 --> 03:03:53.440]  They recruited him, they trained him.
[03:03:53.440 --> 03:03:58.440]  I'm sure his background with them got him the access he needed
[03:03:58.440 --> 03:04:00.440]  in the Naval Reserves to do what he did for them
[03:04:00.440 --> 03:04:05.440]  and to hone his skills into the killing machine that they said he was, okay?
[03:04:05.440 --> 03:04:07.440]  So it's all about them, okay?
[03:04:07.440 --> 03:04:09.440]  He snaps, okay?
[03:04:09.440 --> 03:04:11.440]  Supposedly he snaps, okay?
[03:04:11.440 --> 03:04:14.440]  And then he goes off the reservation, okay?
[03:04:14.440 --> 03:04:16.440]  Now, he's black, right?
[03:04:16.440 --> 03:04:18.440]  And I got nothing against black people, I don't.
[03:04:18.440 --> 03:04:20.440]  But he's black, okay?
[03:04:20.440 --> 03:04:25.440]  Most of your militia movements are primarily constituted of white members, okay?
[03:04:25.440 --> 03:04:26.440]  They're not going to support him.
[03:04:26.440 --> 03:04:28.440]  A black cop wants to go rogue and kill all the cops.
[03:04:28.440 --> 03:04:29.440]  They're going to say, knock yourself out.
[03:04:29.440 --> 03:04:31.440]  They're not going to get support from him.
[03:04:31.440 --> 03:04:33.440]  He's not an advocate of the Second Amendment,
[03:04:33.440 --> 03:04:35.440]  so the gun rights owners aren't going to support him
[03:04:35.440 --> 03:04:37.440]  because, God forbid, if they went after it,
[03:04:37.440 --> 03:04:39.440]  if they went killing gun rights owners, oh, they'd have it.
[03:04:39.440 --> 03:04:41.440]  So what's your bottom line?
[03:04:41.440 --> 03:04:43.440]  You think it's a sign-up?
[03:04:43.440 --> 03:04:45.440]  My bottom line, yeah, I believe it is a sign-up.
[03:04:45.440 --> 03:04:47.440]  I believe it because think about what they did.
[03:04:47.440 --> 03:04:48.440]  They crossed.
[03:04:48.440 --> 03:04:49.440]  They went out of their jurisdiction.
[03:04:49.440 --> 03:04:51.440]  They went into San Bernardino County,
[03:04:51.440 --> 03:04:53.440]  and even though San Bernardino had two officers that were down,
[03:04:53.440 --> 03:04:56.440]  one that was dead, okay,
[03:04:56.440 --> 03:04:58.440]  they weren't running around shooting up random.
[03:04:58.440 --> 03:04:59.440]  They weren't running around.
[03:04:59.440 --> 03:05:20.440]  I hear you. I hear you.
