[00:00.000 --> 00:24.080]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the Alex Jones show.
[00:24.080 --> 00:25.080]  I'm Harrison Smith.
[00:25.080 --> 00:29.960]  It's January 6, and Donald Trump has just begun speaking to the Stop the Steel March
[00:29.960 --> 00:30.960]  in Washington.
[00:30.960 --> 00:36.960]  Without any further ado, we go now to the President of the United States in Washington.
[00:36.960 --> 01:05.120]  We have hundreds of thousands of people here, and I just want them to be recognized by the
[01:05.120 --> 01:06.120]  fake news media.
[01:06.120 --> 01:12.600]  Turn your cameras, please, and show what's really happening out here, because these people
[01:12.600 --> 01:15.440]  are not going to take it any longer.
[01:15.440 --> 01:18.400]  They're not going to take it any longer.
[01:18.400 --> 01:19.400]  Go ahead.
[01:19.400 --> 01:20.400]  Turn your cameras, please.
[01:20.400 --> 01:21.400]  Would you show?
[01:21.400 --> 01:28.640]  They came from all over the world, actually, but they came from all over our country.
[01:28.640 --> 01:31.440]  I just really want to see what they do.
[01:31.440 --> 01:33.160]  I just want to see how they cover it.
[01:33.160 --> 01:39.800]  And I've never seen anything like it, but it would be really great if we could be covered
[01:39.800 --> 01:41.040]  fairly by the media.
[01:41.040 --> 01:45.880]  The media is the biggest problem we have, as far as I'm concerned, single biggest problem.
[01:45.880 --> 01:48.200]  The fake news and the big tech.
[01:48.200 --> 01:50.980]  Big tech is now coming into their own.
[01:50.980 --> 01:52.680]  We beat them four years ago.
[01:52.680 --> 01:53.680]  We surprised them.
[01:53.680 --> 01:57.440]  We took them by surprise, and this year they rigged an election.
[01:57.440 --> 02:00.200]  They rigged it like they've never rigged an election before.
[02:00.200 --> 02:05.560]  And by the way, last night, they didn't do a bad job either, if you notice.
[02:05.560 --> 02:09.040]  I'm honest, and I just, again, I want to thank you.
[02:09.040 --> 02:15.640]  It's just a great honor to have this kind of crowd and to be before you, and hundreds
[02:15.640 --> 02:22.720]  of thousands of American patriots are committed to the honesty of our elections and the integrity
[02:22.720 --> 02:25.120]  of our glorious republic.
[02:25.120 --> 02:31.080]  All of us here today do not want to see our election victory stolen by a bold and radical
[02:31.080 --> 02:36.520]  left Democrats, which is what they're doing, and stolen by the fake news media.
[02:36.520 --> 02:39.020]  That's what they've done and what they're doing.
[02:39.020 --> 02:40.320]  We will never give up.
[02:40.320 --> 02:41.760]  We will never concede.
[02:41.760 --> 02:42.760]  It doesn't happen.
[02:42.760 --> 02:48.160]  You don't concede when there's theft involved.
[02:48.160 --> 02:50.240]  Our country has had enough.
[02:50.240 --> 02:57.560]  We will not take it anymore, and that's what this is all about.
[02:57.560 --> 03:04.360]  And to use a favorite term that all of you people really came up with, we will stop the
[03:04.360 --> 03:05.360]  steal.
[03:05.360 --> 03:14.240]  Today, I will lay out just some of the evidence proving that we won this election and we won
[03:14.240 --> 03:15.600]  it by a landslide.
[03:15.600 --> 03:17.760]  This was not a close election.
[03:17.760 --> 03:22.280]  You know, I say sometimes jokingly, but there's no joke about it.
[03:22.280 --> 03:23.560]  I've been in two elections.
[03:23.560 --> 03:30.640]  I won them both, and the second one I won much bigger than the first, okay?
[03:30.640 --> 03:37.320]  Almost 75 million people voted for our campaign, the most of any incumbent president by far
[03:37.320 --> 03:47.120]  in the history of our country, 12 million more people than four years ago.
[03:47.120 --> 03:52.440]  And I was told by the real pollsters, we do have real pollsters, they know that we were
[03:52.440 --> 03:58.120]  going to do well and we were going to win, but I was told if I went from 63 million,
[03:58.120 --> 04:04.440]  which we had four years ago, to 66 million, there was no chance of losing.
[04:04.440 --> 04:13.160]  Well, we didn't go to 66, we went to 75 million, and they say we lost, we didn't lose.
[04:13.160 --> 04:18.320]  And by the way, does anybody believe that Joe had 80 million votes?
[04:18.320 --> 04:23.480]  Does anybody believe that?
[04:23.480 --> 04:27.000]  He had 80 million computer votes.
[04:27.000 --> 04:28.000]  It's a disgrace.
[04:28.000 --> 04:30.160]  There's never been anything like that.
[04:30.160 --> 04:32.960]  You could take third world countries, just take a look.
[04:32.960 --> 04:37.160]  Take third world countries, their elections are more honest than what we've been going
[04:37.160 --> 04:38.800]  through in this country.
[04:38.800 --> 04:40.240]  It's a disgrace.
[04:40.240 --> 04:41.560]  It's a disgrace.
[04:41.560 --> 04:46.240]  And when you look at last night, they're all running around like chickens with eggs,
[04:46.240 --> 04:47.240]  cuddles.
[04:47.240 --> 04:49.800]  Addressing the incredible crowds out in front of the White House, we'll be back in 60 seconds
[04:49.800 --> 04:54.640]  to continue this live broadcast, infowars.com, band.video, share this link folks, we'll be
[04:54.640 --> 04:59.840]  right back.
[04:59.840 --> 05:04.520]  Due to the COVID lockdown destroying the supply chain, many of the best selling products,
[05:04.520 --> 05:08.800]  InfoWars are no longer available, and I thought that pollen block might be gone forever,
[05:08.800 --> 05:14.520]  but after eight months, we got about 25% of the order we put in delivered to us.
[05:14.520 --> 05:16.640]  The rest they hope in a few months comes in.
[05:16.640 --> 05:22.440]  It's a proprietary system using specially fed quail and their eggs.
[05:22.440 --> 05:27.560]  It's very powerful when it comes to blocking seasonal irritants and a lot more, so get
[05:27.560 --> 05:32.440]  your pollen block back in stock at infowarsstore.com today.
[05:32.440 --> 05:36.080]  And by the way, activated charcoal toothpaste sold out for months is now back in stock as
[05:36.080 --> 05:37.080]  well.
[05:37.080 --> 05:40.760]  InfoWars products and influenza infowars, so get your pollen block and get your activated
[05:40.760 --> 05:43.160]  charcoal toothpaste at infowarsstore.com today.
[05:43.160 --> 05:48.600]  Again, our activated charcoal toothpaste doesn't have additives, it's concentrated, people love
[05:48.600 --> 05:52.440]  it, it's amazing, there's no toothpaste out there like it, and pollen block is a proprietary

[06:03.480 --> 06:04.960]  Welcome back folks, it's the Alex Jones Show.
[06:04.960 --> 06:11.760]  I'm Harrison Smith, we are watching live President Trump address the multitudes gathered in Washington
[06:11.760 --> 06:16.680]  D.C. for the stop the steel march without any further ado, the President of the United
[06:16.680 --> 06:17.680]  States.
[06:17.680 --> 06:21.560]  Because if Mike Pence does the right thing, we win the election.
[06:21.560 --> 06:31.360]  All he has to do, this is from the number one or certainly one of the top constitutional
[06:31.360 --> 06:33.280]  lawyers in our country.
[06:33.280 --> 06:37.960]  He has the absolute right to do it, we're supposed to protect our country, support our
[06:37.960 --> 06:44.000]  country, support our constitution and protect our constitution.
[06:44.000 --> 06:51.480]  States want to re-vote, the states got defrauded, they were given false information, they voted
[06:51.480 --> 06:58.360]  on it, now they want to re-certify, they want it back, all Vice President Pence has to do
[06:58.360 --> 07:06.240]  is send it back to the states to re-certify and we become president and you are the happiest
[07:06.240 --> 07:12.040]  people.
[07:12.040 --> 07:17.920]  And I actually, I just spoke to Mike, I said Mike that doesn't take courage, what takes
[07:17.920 --> 07:24.400]  courage is to do nothing, that takes courage and then we're stuck with the President who
[07:24.400 --> 07:29.460]  lost the election by a lot and we have to live with that for four more years, we're
[07:29.460 --> 07:31.200]  just not going to let that happen.
[07:31.200 --> 07:36.200]  Many of you have traveled from all across the nation to be here and I want to thank
[07:36.200 --> 07:40.400]  you for the extraordinary love, that's what it is, there's never been a movement like
[07:40.400 --> 07:48.760]  this ever, ever for the extraordinary love for this amazing country and this amazing
[07:48.760 --> 08:04.320]  movement, thank you.
[08:04.320 --> 08:08.480]  By the way this goes all the way back past the Washington Monument, do you believe this,
[08:08.480 --> 08:16.240]  look at this, that was, unfortunately they gave the press the prime seats, I can't stand
[08:16.240 --> 08:21.800]  there, now but you look at that behind, I wish they'd flipped those cameras and looked
[08:21.800 --> 08:27.880]  behind you, that is the most amazing sight, when they make a mistake you get to see it
[08:27.880 --> 08:37.360]  on television, amazing, amazing, all the way back and don't worry we will not take the
[08:37.360 --> 08:43.760]  name off the Washington Monument, we will cancel culture, you know they wanted to get
[08:43.760 --> 08:49.480]  rid of the Jefferson Memorial, either take it down or just put somebody else in there,
[08:49.480 --> 08:54.000]  I don't think that's going to happen, it damn well better not, although with this administration
[08:54.000 --> 08:59.760]  if this happens, it could happen, you'll see some really bad things happen, they'll knock
[08:59.760 --> 09:03.440]  out Lincoln too by the way, they've been taking his statue down, but then we signed
[09:03.440 --> 09:09.040]  a little law, you hurt our monuments, you hurt our heroes, you go to jail for ten years
[09:09.040 --> 09:16.280]  and everything stopped, you notice that, it stopped, it all stopped, and they could use
[09:16.280 --> 09:22.800]  Rudy back in New York City Rudy, they could use you, your city is going to hell, they
[09:22.800 --> 09:28.080]  want Rudy Giuliani back in New York, we'll get a little younger version of Rudy, is
[09:28.080 --> 09:33.920]  that okay Rudy, we're gathered together in the heart of our nation's capital for one
[09:33.920 --> 09:45.560]  very very basic and simple reason to save our democracy, you know most candidates on
[09:45.560 --> 09:49.920]  election evening, and of course this thing goes on so long, they still don't have any
[09:49.920 --> 09:55.200]  idea what the votes are, we still have congressional seats under review, they have no idea, they've
[09:55.200 --> 10:01.080]  totally lost control, they've used the pandemic as a way of defrauding the people in a proper
[10:01.080 --> 10:07.840]  election, but you know, you know when you see this and when you see what's happening,
[10:07.840 --> 10:12.320]  number one, they all say sir, we'll never let it happen again, I said that's good, but
[10:12.320 --> 10:16.840]  what about eight weeks ago, you know they try and get you to go, they say sir, in four
[10:16.840 --> 10:22.480]  years you're guaranteed, I said I'm not interested right now, do me a favor, go back eight weeks,
[10:22.480 --> 10:28.680]  I want to go back eight weeks, let's go back eight weeks, we want to go back and we want
[10:28.680 --> 10:32.640]  to get this right, because we're going to have somebody in there that should not be
[10:32.640 --> 10:39.440]  in there, and our country will be destroyed, and we're not going to stand for that, for
[10:39.440 --> 10:45.320]  years democrats have gotten away with election fraud, and weak republicans, and that's what
[10:45.320 --> 10:50.960]  they are, there's so many weak republicans, and we have great ones, Jim Jordan and some
[10:50.960 --> 10:56.560]  of these guys there out there fighting, the house guys are fighting, but it's incredible,
[10:56.560 --> 11:01.360]  many of the republicans I helped them get in, I helped them get elected, I helped Mitch
[11:01.360 --> 11:11.560]  get elected, I helped, I could name 24 of them, let's say, I won't bore you with it,
[11:11.560 --> 11:16.560]  and then all of a sudden you have something like this, it's like oh gee, maybe I'll talk
[11:16.560 --> 11:21.600]  to the president sometime later, now it's amazing, the weak republicans, the pathetic
[11:21.600 --> 11:26.560]  republicans, and that's what happens, if this happened to the democrats, they'd be hell
[11:26.560 --> 11:32.840]  all over the country going on, they'd be hell all over the country, but just remember this,
[11:32.840 --> 11:38.800]  you're stronger, you're smarter, you've got more going than anybody, and they try and
[11:38.800 --> 11:44.080]  demean everybody having to do with us, and you're the real people, you're the people
[11:44.080 --> 11:52.280]  that built this nation, you're not the people that tore down our nation, the weak republicans,
[11:52.280 --> 11:56.280]  and that's it, I really believe it, I think I'm going to use the term the weak republicans,
[11:56.280 --> 11:58.560]  you've got a lot of them, and you've got a lot of great ones, but you've got a lot of
[11:58.560 --> 12:04.400]  weak ones, they've turned a blind eye, even as democrats enacted policies that shipped
[12:04.400 --> 12:12.400]  away our jobs, weakened our military, threw open our borders, and put America last, did
[12:12.400 --> 12:18.000]  you see the other day where Joe Biden said, I want to get rid of the America first policy,
[12:18.000 --> 12:23.600]  what's that all about, how do you say I want to get rid of America first, even if you're
[12:23.600 --> 12:30.360]  going to do it, don't talk about it, unbelievable what we have to go through, what we have to
[12:30.360 --> 12:34.960]  go through, and you have to get your people to fight, and if they don't fight, we have
[12:34.960 --> 12:40.640]  to primary the hell out of the ones that don't fight, you primary them, we're going to let
[12:40.640 --> 12:47.040]  you know who they are, I can already tell you frankly, but this year using the pretext
[12:47.040 --> 12:53.600]  of the China virus and the scam of mail-in ballots, democrats attempted the most brazen
[12:53.600 --> 12:58.320]  and outrageous election theft, and there's never been anything like this, it's a pure
[12:58.320 --> 13:04.160]  theft in American history, everybody knows it, that election, our election was over at
[13:04.160 --> 13:10.560]  10 o'clock in the evening, we're leading Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia, by hundreds
[13:10.560 --> 13:16.520]  of thousands of votes, and then late in the evening or early in the morning, boom, these
[13:16.520 --> 13:31.040]  explosions of bullshit, and all of a sudden, all of a sudden it started to happen, all
[13:31.040 --> 13:52.320]  of a sudden the
[13:52.320 --> 13:57.500]  typical, well, I'd like to congratulate the victor, the victor. Who is the
[13:57.500 --> 14:01.600]  victor, Mitt? I'd like to congratulate. They don't go and look at the facts. Now,
[14:01.600 --> 14:05.920]  I don't know. He got, he got slaughtered, probably. Maybe it was okay. Maybe it was,
[14:05.920 --> 14:11.160]  that's what happened. But we look at the facts, and our election was so corrupt
[14:11.160 --> 14:14.920]  that in the history of this country, we've never seen anything like it. You can
[14:14.920 --> 14:20.360]  go all the way back. You know, America is blessed with elections all over the
[14:20.360 --> 14:23.840]  world. They talk about our elections. You know what the world says about us now?
[14:23.840 --> 14:27.960]  They say, we don't have free and fair elections. And you know what else? We don't
[14:27.960 --> 14:34.800]  have a free and fair press. Our media is not free. It's not fair. It suppresses
[14:34.800 --> 14:41.160]  thought. It suppresses speech. And it's become the enemy of the people. It's
[14:41.160 --> 14:46.000]  become the enemy of the people. It's a, it's the biggest problem we have in this
[14:46.000 --> 14:53.080]  country. No third world countries would even attempt to do what we caught them
[14:53.080 --> 14:58.760]  doing. And you'll hear about that in just a few minutes. Republicans are,
[14:58.760 --> 15:06.480]  Republicans are constantly fighting like a boxer with his hands tied behind his
[15:06.480 --> 15:13.680]  back. It's like a boxer. And we want to be so nice. We want to be so respectful
[15:13.680 --> 15:19.760]  of everybody, including bad people. And we're going to have to fight much harder.
[15:19.760 --> 15:25.920]  And Mike Pence is going to have to come through for us. And if he doesn't, that
[15:25.920 --> 15:33.080]  will be a sad day for our country because you're sworn to uphold our
[15:33.080 --> 15:41.640]  constitution. Now it is up to Congress to confront this egregious assault on our
[15:41.640 --> 15:46.200]  democracy. Donald Trump is giving it to Republicans and Democrats alike in
[15:46.200 --> 15:49.320]  defense of the Constitution. We have to go to a quick commercial break and see
[15:49.320 --> 15:53.400]  Alex Jones show. We'll be right back with more of Donald Trump live from
[15:53.400 --> 15:57.600]  outside the White House when we get back. Stay with us, folks. Right to try.
[15:57.600 --> 16:03.840]  Everybody know about the resistance, not video. The resistance, not video. The
[16:03.840 --> 16:10.480]  resistance, not video. The resistance, not video. The resistance, not video. The
[16:10.480 --> 16:19.360]  resistance, not video. Infowars.com. Newswars.com. Band.video. And hundreds of other
[16:19.360 --> 16:24.440]  URLs we've launched have been banned. That's why every month we launch a new
[16:24.440 --> 16:31.040]  URL before they ban it. But Soros and Bill Gates and the gloves are on our
[16:31.040 --> 16:38.120]  tail. But the new website is theresistance.video. The resistance.video.
[16:38.120 --> 16:43.200]  They're trying to block us because the truth is powerful and can defeat them. So
[16:43.200 --> 16:47.720]  the new URL that links right to Band.video and all of our videos and all of
[16:47.720 --> 16:50.520]  our documentaries and all the special reports and all the suppressed
[16:50.520 --> 16:55.520]  information is that the resistance, not video. Share the link. The resistance, not
[16:55.520 --> 17:00.600]  video. The resistance, not video. Mountain Patriot in Colorado. Thank you for
[17:00.600 --> 17:04.800]  holding. How you doing, Alex? Man, I'm just working as hard as I can. We're in
[17:04.800 --> 17:08.640]  such a critical time. Brother, how are you? I love you, man. I want to make a
[17:08.640 --> 17:13.280]  quick plug. That's DNA force. I love it. I've been using it quite a while and I
[17:13.280 --> 17:17.000]  just went, looked at the ingredients again the other day and I see that it
[17:17.000 --> 17:23.040]  contains cortisans, which according to some published studies that Dr. Merkula
[17:23.040 --> 17:29.200]  has cited, is an ionophore similar to hydroxychloroquine. And it helps
[17:29.200 --> 17:32.840]  channel the zinc into the cells. So people might want to take a look at
[17:32.840 --> 17:38.520]  that. All I know is with DNA force, we went out and looked at these high end
[17:38.520 --> 17:42.360]  products that they sell through doctor clinics that aren't prescription, but
[17:42.360 --> 17:45.400]  the doctors sell them like 300 bucks a bottle because there's a lot of expensive
[17:45.400 --> 17:48.680]  products and it's really only cost them like 50 bucks. And so we basically
[17:48.680 --> 17:52.440]  cloned two different top brands together and that's what produced this. So
[17:52.440 --> 17:57.200]  thanks. Thanks for the plug. 10 o'clock it was open, but I was gonna take a few
[17:57.200 --> 18:03.560]  days and I can say this. Since our election, you're listening to the Alex
[18:03.560 --> 18:08.280]  Jones show. Even these guys do what happened. They know what happened. They're
[18:08.280 --> 18:10.480]  saying, wow, Pennsylvania.
[18:15.840 --> 18:19.240]  We are live folks. It's the Alex Jones show. I'm Harrison Smith. We're watching
[18:19.240 --> 18:23.040]  President Trump address the multitudes out in front of the White House. Alex
[18:23.040 --> 18:26.960]  Jones will soon be leading a parade to the Capitol. But for now, we go back to
[18:26.960 --> 18:30.480]  the president of the United States who's laying out the evidence of the vote
[18:30.480 --> 18:36.280]  fraud. We set a record and we set a record with Hispanic with the black
[18:36.280 --> 18:38.680]  community. We set a record with everybody.
[18:40.840 --> 18:46.360]  Today we see a very important event, though, because right over there right
[18:46.360 --> 18:51.640]  there, we see the event going to take place and I'm going to be watching
[18:52.200 --> 18:56.400]  because history is going to be made. We're going to see whether or not we
[18:56.400 --> 19:01.520]  have great and courageous leaders or whether or not we have leaders that
[19:01.520 --> 19:06.520]  should be ashamed of themselves throughout history, throughout eternity.
[19:06.880 --> 19:11.840]  They'll be ashamed. And you know what? If they do the wrong thing, we should
[19:11.840 --> 19:18.360]  never ever forget that they did. Never forget. We should never ever forget
[19:19.080 --> 19:25.080]  with only three of the seven states in question. We win the presidency of the
[19:25.080 --> 19:31.240]  United States. And by the way, it's much more important today than it was 24
[19:31.240 --> 19:37.720]  hours ago because and don't I spoke to David Purdue. What a great person and
[19:37.720 --> 19:43.520]  Kelly Lefler, two great people. But it was a setup. And you know, I said,
[19:44.600 --> 19:51.480]  we have no backline anymore. The only backline, the only line of demarcation,
[19:51.480 --> 19:55.600]  the only line that we have is the veto of the president of the United
[19:55.600 --> 20:01.240]  States. So this is now what we're doing, a far more important election than it
[20:01.240 --> 20:07.920]  was two days ago. I want to thank the more than 140 members of the House.
[20:07.920 --> 20:12.840]  Those are warriors. They're over there working like you've never seen before
[20:12.840 --> 20:18.160]  studying, talking, actually going all the way back, studying the roots of the
[20:18.160 --> 20:23.480]  Constitution, because they know we have the right to send a bad vote that was
[20:23.480 --> 20:29.200]  illegally gotten. They gave these people bad things to vote for and they voted
[20:29.200 --> 20:32.840]  because what did they know? And then when they found out a few weeks later again,
[20:32.840 --> 20:37.600]  it took them four years to devise this screen. And the only unhappy person in
[20:37.600 --> 20:42.680]  the United States single most unhappy is Hillary Clinton, because she said, Why
[20:42.680 --> 20:47.400]  didn't you do this for me four years ago? Why didn't you do this for me four
[20:47.400 --> 20:53.800]  years ago? Change the votes, 10,000 in Michigan. You could have changed the whole
[20:53.800 --> 20:58.520]  thing, but she's not too happy. You don't see her anymore. What happened? Where's
[20:58.520 --> 21:05.640]  Hillary? Where is she? But I want to thank all of those congressmen and women.
[21:05.640 --> 21:11.720]  I also want to thank our 13 most courageous members of the U.S. Senate,
[21:11.720 --> 21:20.440]  Senator Ted Cruz, Senator Ron Johnson, Senator Josh Hawley, Kelly Lafler, and
[21:20.440 --> 21:27.920]  Kelly Lafler. I'll tell you, she's been so great. She worked so hard. So let's
[21:27.920 --> 21:30.960]  give her and David a little special hand, because it was rigged against them.
[21:30.960 --> 21:38.000]  Let's give her and David, Kelly Lafler, David Perdue. They fought a good race.
[21:38.000 --> 21:42.640]  They never had a shot. That equipment should never have been allowed to be
[21:42.640 --> 21:48.240]  used, and I was telling these people, don't let them use this stuff. Marjor,
[21:48.240 --> 21:53.840]  Blackburn, terrific person, Mike Braun, Indiana, Steve Daines, great guy, Bill
[21:53.840 --> 22:01.880]  Haggerty, John Kennedy, James Lienford, Cynthia Lums, Tommy Tuberville, the coach,
[22:01.880 --> 22:06.240]  and Roger Marshall. We want to thank them. Senators have stepped up. We want to
[22:06.240 --> 22:13.560]  thank them. I actually think, though, it takes again more courage not to step up,
[22:13.560 --> 22:17.240]  and I think a lot of those people are going to find that out, and you better
[22:17.240 --> 22:20.760]  start looking at your leadership, because your leadership has led you down the
[22:20.760 --> 22:26.040]  tubes. You know, we don't want to give $2,000 to people. We want to give them
[22:26.040 --> 22:30.320]  $600. Oh, great. How does that play politically? Pretty good. And this has
[22:30.320 --> 22:36.720]  nothing to do with politics, but how does it play politically? China destroyed
[22:36.720 --> 22:43.200]  these people. China destroyed them. Totally destroyed them. We want to give
[22:43.200 --> 22:50.360]  them $600, and they just wouldn't change. I said, give them $2,000. We'll pay it
[22:50.360 --> 22:56.680]  back. We'll pay it back fast. You already owe $26 trillion. Give them a couple of
[22:56.680 --> 23:03.400]  bucks. Let them live. Give them a couple of bucks. And some of the people here
[23:03.400 --> 23:08.400]  disagree with me on that, but I just say, look, you got to let people live. And how
[23:08.400 --> 23:11.920]  does that play, though? Okay, number one, it's the right thing to do, but how does
[23:11.920 --> 23:16.120]  that play politically? I think it's the primary reason. One of the primary
[23:16.120 --> 23:20.320]  reasons the other was just pure cheating. That was the primary, super primary
[23:20.320 --> 23:24.920]  reason. But you can't do that. You've got to use your head. As you know, the media
[23:24.920 --> 23:30.000]  has constantly asserted the outrageous lie that there was no evidence of widespread
[23:30.000 --> 23:34.440]  fraud. Do you ever see these people? While there is no evidence of fraud, or
[23:34.440 --> 23:38.120]  really? Well, I'm going to read you pages. I hope you don't get bored listening to it.
[23:38.120 --> 23:42.720]  Promise. Don't get bored listening to it. All those hundreds of thousands of people
[23:42.720 --> 23:49.720]  back there. Move them up, please. Yeah. All these people, don't get bored.
[23:49.720 --> 23:53.480]  Don't get angry at me because you're going to get bored because it's so much.
[23:53.480 --> 23:59.620]  The American people do not believe the corrupt, fake news anymore. They have
[23:59.620 --> 24:04.680]  ruined their reputation. But you know, it used to be that they'd argue with me. I'd
[24:04.680 --> 24:08.320]  fight. So I'd fight. They'd fight. I'd fight. They'd fight. Bop, bop. You'd believe me.
[24:08.320 --> 24:11.880]  You'd believe them. Somebody comes out. You know, they had their point of view. I
[24:11.880 --> 24:15.640]  had my point of view. But you'd have an argument. Now what they do is they go
[24:15.640 --> 24:21.800]  silent. It's called suppression. And that's what happens in a communist country.
[24:21.800 --> 24:26.960]  That's what they do. They suppress. You don't fight with them anymore unless it's
[24:26.960 --> 24:30.120]  a bad serve. They have a little bad story about me. They make it ten times worse
[24:30.120 --> 24:34.120]  and it's a major headline. But Hunter Biden, they don't talk about him. What
[24:34.120 --> 24:39.360]  happened to Hunter? Where's Hunter? Where is Hunter? They don't talk about him. Now
[24:39.360 --> 24:43.320]  watch. All the sets will go off. Well, they can't do that because they get good
[24:43.320 --> 24:49.640]  ratings. The ratings are too good. Now where's Hunter? You know? And how come Joe
[24:49.640 --> 24:55.360]  was allowed to give a billion dollars of money to get rid of the prosecutor in
[24:55.360 --> 25:00.440]  Ukraine? How does that happen? I'd ask you that question. How does that happen? Can
[25:00.440 --> 25:05.080]  you imagine if I said that? If I said that, it would be a whole different ball
[25:05.080 --> 25:11.720]  game. And how come Hunter gets three and a half million dollars from the mayor of
[25:11.720 --> 25:17.720]  Moscow's wife and gets hundreds of thousands of dollars to sit on an energy
[25:17.720 --> 25:23.080]  board even though he admits he has no knowledge of energy and millions of
[25:23.080 --> 25:27.920]  dollars up front? And how come they go into China and they leave with billions
[25:27.920 --> 25:32.000]  of dollars to manage? Have you managed money before? No, I haven't. Oh, that's
[25:32.000 --> 25:36.520]  good. Here's about three billion. No, they don't talk about that. No, we have a
[25:36.520 --> 25:42.280]  corrupt media. They've gone silent. They've gone dead. I now realize how good
[25:42.280 --> 25:47.960]  it was. If you go back 10 years, I realize how good, even though I didn't
[25:47.960 --> 25:52.840]  necessarily love them, I realize how good it was like a cleansing motion, right?
[25:52.840 --> 25:58.520]  But we don't have that anymore. We don't have a fair media anymore. It's
[25:58.520 --> 26:03.040]  suppression. And you have to be very careful with that. And they've lost all
[26:03.040 --> 26:08.600]  credibility in this country. We will not be intimidated into accepting the
[26:08.600 --> 26:15.360]  hoaxes and the lies that we've been forced to believe. Over the past several
[26:15.360 --> 26:21.480]  weeks, we've amassed overwhelming evidence about a fake election. This is the
[26:21.480 --> 26:26.200]  presidential election. Last night was a little bit better because of the fact
[26:26.200 --> 26:30.440]  that we had a lot of eyes watching one specific state, but they cheated like
[26:30.440 --> 26:36.440]  hell anyway. You have one of the dumbest governors in the United States. And you
[26:36.440 --> 26:40.200]  know when I was president of the United States, Donald Trump giving perhaps the
[26:40.200 --> 26:45.400]  most important speech of his entire presidency, and perhaps will change the
[26:45.400 --> 26:50.000]  course of history. He plans on laying out in detail the evidence of voter fraud
[26:50.000 --> 26:53.840]  will bring it all to you live on info wars dot com and banned on video on the
[26:53.840 --> 26:58.880]  other side folks don't go anywhere. You must guard your humanity. You must guard
[26:58.880 --> 27:04.040]  your children's humanity. You must guard the very genetic code of the planet. The
[27:04.040 --> 27:08.520]  globalists have set themselves up as the guardians of this world. They are the
[27:08.520 --> 27:12.680]  ones that are overriding every genetic system and poison the planet. They are
[27:12.680 --> 27:18.240]  the ones that are now engaged in genetic takeover of every human on earth to the
[27:18.240 --> 27:23.040]  GMO crops. And now they've moved on to their main target to madly with the
[27:23.040 --> 27:29.760]  mRNA vaccines, which are not vaccines. They are recombinant DNA from aborted
[27:29.760 --> 27:36.160]  cloned fetuses were then inserted into your genome to take over your body's
[27:36.160 --> 27:43.320]  systems. Go read the actual inserts for the mRNA vaccines and then remember
[27:43.320 --> 27:48.160]  you've been warned. This is the equivalent of an alien takeover. Whether it's
[27:48.160 --> 27:51.360]  interdimensional, whether it's little green men, the globalists are acting like
[27:51.360 --> 27:54.800]  another species that's overtaking us and overriding us. It's all the same in the
[27:54.800 --> 28:00.880]  end. Mr. Dictionary has a very simple definition of terrorism. Other
[28:00.880 --> 28:05.540]  dictionaries have some of those. Terrorism is the threat of force or action
[28:05.540 --> 28:12.080]  carrying out for a political or financial reason. It's basically scaring the hell
[28:12.080 --> 28:16.280]  out of people until you submit to them. That's exactly what all this overblown
[28:16.280 --> 28:21.280]  COVID-19 garbage is. You see the headlines are CNN, ABC News, doctors say it's
[28:21.280 --> 28:25.600]  worse than they ever thought. COVID more devastating than it ever imagined. They
[28:25.600 --> 28:29.840]  told us that two and a half million people would be dead just eight months
[28:29.840 --> 28:35.400]  ago within three months. Okay, it's a quarter million if you count all of the
[28:35.400 --> 28:39.880]  people that died of other things. We're talking 96% at co-probability. These are
[28:39.880 --> 28:43.440]  real numbers. These are real facts. This is the chicken little event. We're all
[28:43.440 --> 28:47.120]  running our houses, never coming out and are taught we're not essential. All the
[28:47.120 --> 28:51.680]  big box stores in Amazon take over the planet. You could stand up against it. This
[28:51.680 --> 28:56.800]  is slavery. It is not something you can pull up with and survive. Our
[28:56.800 --> 29:01.680]  activated charcoal toothpaste became a best-seller overnight because activated
[29:01.680 --> 29:05.240]  charcoal is already one of the top-selling fastest-growing toothpaste out there.
[29:05.240 --> 29:09.080]  The problem is a lot of the other over-the-counter ones have aspartame as
[29:09.080 --> 29:13.080]  their flavoring, very, very toxic, and also they have fluoride in it. This does
[29:13.080 --> 29:16.680]  not have the fluoride. It doesn't have the additives. This is a concentrate. It
[29:16.680 --> 29:20.280]  really is high quality. It's been sold out for months because of supply chain
[29:20.280 --> 29:24.540]  breakdowns with the whole COVID martial law garbage, but now it's back in stock.
[29:24.540 --> 29:30.720]  Info Wars, Dr. Jones Naturals, activated charcoal toothpaste. Now back in stock at
[29:30.720 --> 29:36.920]  infowarstore.com or call toll-free, triple-A-2-5-3-3-1-3-9. It also makes a great

[29:41.160 --> 29:44.960]  everybody, and it supports the info war. Activated charcoal from Dr. Jones

[29:56.480 --> 30:01.560]  Inflation is here and many experts believe hyperinflation could be coming, especially
[30:01.560 --> 30:05.800]  if the globalists are successful in killing the dollar. Tens of millions of
[30:05.800 --> 30:10.400]  Americans that were not awake are now beginning to store food. That's a good
[30:10.400 --> 30:15.320]  thing, but it's going to drive up prices and we're already beginning to see record sales
[30:15.320 --> 30:20.440]  once again. We the people understand it's up to us to protect ourselves. It's up
[30:20.440 --> 30:24.880]  to us to become self-sufficient. The globalists are waging seeds against us,
[30:24.880 --> 30:29.640]  trying to destroy our businesses, trying to bankrupt our families, our towns, our
[30:29.640 --> 30:34.520]  churches. That's why, while we still can, we've got to get prepared and get ready.
[30:34.520 --> 30:40.360]  Take advantage of a huge final mega sale before prices go up and prepare without
[30:40.360 --> 30:45.960]  dollars.com and save up to $850 off the highest quality storeable foods out
[30:45.960 --> 30:51.240]  there. You've got until Friday, January 8th to get your orders in and prepare
[30:51.240 --> 30:55.400]  without dollars.com and lock in the lowest prices out there on high quality
[30:55.400 --> 31:14.760]  storeable food. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[31:14.760 --> 31:30.680]  The Alex Jones show, because there is a war on for your mind.
[31:30.680 --> 31:35.520]  Just 11 days prior to the election, so think of what they did. No longer is
[31:35.520 --> 31:41.600]  their signature verification. Oh, that's okay. We want voter ID, by the way, but no
[31:41.600 --> 31:46.800]  longer is their signature verification. 11 days before the election, they say we
[31:46.800 --> 31:51.120]  don't want it. You know why they don't want it? Because they want to cheat. That's
[31:51.120 --> 31:55.720]  the only reason. Who would even think of that? We don't want to verify a signature.
[31:55.720 --> 32:02.720]  There were over 205,000 more ballots counted in Pennsylvania. Now think of
[32:02.720 --> 32:12.120]  this. You had 205,000 more ballots than you had voters. That means you had to
[32:12.120 --> 32:15.600]  where did they come from? You know where they came from? Somebody's imagination,
[32:15.600 --> 32:23.320]  whatever they needed. So in Pennsylvania, you had 205,000 more votes than you had
[32:23.320 --> 32:29.120]  voters. And it's the numbers actually much greater than that now. That was as of
[32:29.120 --> 32:36.240]  a week ago. And this is a mathematical impossibility unless you want to say it's
[32:36.240 --> 32:42.480]  a total fraud. So Pennsylvania was defrauded. Over 8,000 ballots in
[32:42.480 --> 32:47.480]  Pennsylvania were cast by people whose names and dates of birth match
[32:47.480 --> 32:54.600]  individuals who died in 2020 and prior to the election. Think of that. Dead
[32:54.600 --> 33:00.240]  people. Lots of dead people, thousands. And some dead people actually requested an
[33:00.240 --> 33:04.640]  application. That bothers me even more. Not only are they voting, they want an
[33:04.640 --> 33:10.720]  application to vote. One of them was 29 years ago died. It's incredible. Over
[33:10.720 --> 33:16.520]  14,000 ballots were cast by out-of-state voters. So these are voters that don't
[33:16.520 --> 33:22.800]  live in the state. And by the way, these numbers are what they call outcome
[33:22.800 --> 33:27.720]  determinative, meaning these numbers far surpass. I lost by a very little bit.
[33:27.720 --> 33:35.240]  These numbers are massive, massive. More than 10,000 votes in Pennsylvania were
[33:35.240 --> 33:41.200]  illegally counted even though they were received after election day. In other
[33:41.200 --> 33:46.840]  words, they were received after election day. Let's count them anyway. And what
[33:46.840 --> 33:51.960]  they did in many cases is they did fraud. They took the date and they moved it
[33:51.960 --> 33:57.520]  back so that it no longer is after election day. And more than 60,000
[33:57.520 --> 34:03.960]  ballots in Pennsylvania were reported, received back. They got back before
[34:03.960 --> 34:07.600]  they were ever supposedly mailed out. In other words, you got the ballot back
[34:07.600 --> 34:16.400]  before you mailed it. Which is also logically and logistically impossible,
[34:16.400 --> 34:20.760]  right? Think of that one. You got the ballot back. Let's send the ballot so
[34:20.760 --> 34:25.360]  they've already been sent. But we got the ballot back before they were sent. I
[34:25.360 --> 34:29.920]  don't think that's too good, right? 25,000 ballots in Pennsylvania were
[34:29.920 --> 34:35.920]  requested by nursing home residents all in a single giant batch, not legal,
[34:35.920 --> 34:41.040]  indicating an enormous illegal ballot harvesting operation. You're not allowed
[34:41.040 --> 34:45.640]  to do it against the law. The day before the election, the state of Pennsylvania
[34:45.640 --> 34:50.600]  reported the number of absentee ballots that had been sent out. Yet this
[34:50.600 --> 34:58.920]  number was suddenly and drastically increased by 400,000 people. It was
[34:58.920 --> 35:04.800]  increased, nobody knows where it came from, by 400,000 ballots one day after
[35:04.800 --> 35:09.320]  the election. It remains totally unexplained. They said, well, we can't
[35:09.320 --> 35:14.200]  figure that. Now, that's many, many times what it would take to overthrow the
[35:14.200 --> 35:20.200]  state. Just that one element. 400,000 ballots appeared from nowhere right
[35:20.200 --> 35:24.840]  after the election. By the way, Pennsylvania has now seen all of this.
[35:24.840 --> 35:29.480]  They didn't know because it was so quick. They had to vote. They voted. But now
[35:29.480 --> 35:34.840]  they see all this stuff. It's all come to life. Doesn't happen that fast. And
[35:34.840 --> 35:40.600]  they want to re-certify their votes. They want to re-certify. But the only way
[35:40.600 --> 35:44.280]  that can happen is if Mike Pence agrees to send it back.
[35:44.280 --> 35:50.280]  Mike Pence has to agree to send it back.
[36:02.280 --> 36:06.280]  And many people in Congress want to send back. And think of what you're doing.
[36:06.280 --> 36:09.480]  Let's say you don't do it. Somebody says, well, we have to obey the
[36:09.480 --> 36:13.600]  Constitution and you are. Because you're protecting our country and you're
[36:13.600 --> 36:17.680]  protecting the Constitution. So you are. But think of what happens.
[36:17.680 --> 36:21.680]  Let's say they're stiffs. And they're stupid people. And they say, well, we
[36:21.680 --> 36:25.120]  really have no choice. Even though Pennsylvania and other states
[36:25.120 --> 36:30.960]  want to redo their votes. They want to see the numbers. They already have the
[36:30.960 --> 36:34.960]  numbers. Go very quickly. And they want to redo their legislature.
[36:34.960 --> 36:38.400]  Because many of these votes were taken, as I said, because it wasn't approved by
[36:38.400 --> 36:41.840]  their legislature. You know? That in itself is legal. And then you
[36:41.840 --> 36:45.440]  have to scam. And that's all of the things that we're talking about.
[36:45.440 --> 36:50.080]  But think of this. If you don't do that, that means you will have
[36:50.080 --> 36:54.720]  a President of the United States for four years with his wonderful son.
[36:54.720 --> 37:00.560]  You will have a President who lost all of these states.
[37:00.560 --> 37:03.920]  Or you will have a President to put it another way
[37:03.920 --> 37:09.600]  who was voted on by a bunch of stupid people
[37:09.600 --> 37:13.600]  who lost all of these states. You will have an illegitimate President.
[37:13.600 --> 37:17.120]  That's what you'll have. And we can't let that happen.
[37:17.120 --> 37:21.440]  These are the facts that you won't hear from the fake news media.
[37:21.440 --> 37:25.520]  It's all part of the suppression effort. They don't want to talk about it.
[37:25.520 --> 37:28.880]  They don't want to talk about it. In fact, when I started talking about that,
[37:28.880 --> 37:32.960]  I guarantee you a lot of the television sets and a lot of those cameras went
[37:32.960 --> 37:37.760]  off. And that's a lot of cameras back there. But a lot of them went off.
[37:37.760 --> 37:42.480]  But these are the things you don't hear about. You don't hear what you just
[37:42.480 --> 37:45.120]  heard. I'm going to go over a few more states.
[37:45.120 --> 37:49.680]  But you don't hear it by the people who wanted to see you and demoralize you
[37:49.680 --> 37:56.160]  and control you, big tech media. Just like the suppression polls that said,
[37:56.160 --> 38:00.720]  we're going to lose Wisconsin by 17 points while we won Wisconsin.
[38:00.720 --> 38:04.560]  They don't have it that way because they lost just by a little sliver.
[38:04.560 --> 38:08.240]  But they had me down the day before Washington Post, ABC Poll,
[38:08.240 --> 38:13.520]  down 17 points. I called up a real pollster. I said, what is that?
[38:13.520 --> 38:18.080]  Sir, let's call this suppression poll. I think you're going to win Wisconsin, sir.
[38:18.080 --> 38:21.920]  I said, but why don't they make it four or five points? Because then people vote.
[38:21.920 --> 38:25.680]  But when you're down 17, they say, hey, I'm not going to waste my time.
[38:25.680 --> 38:31.440]  I love the president, but there's no way. Despite that, despite that, we won
[38:31.440 --> 38:36.080]  Wisconsin. It's going to see. I mean, you'll see.
[38:36.080 --> 38:41.040]  But that's called suppression because a lot of people, when they see that,
[38:41.040 --> 38:44.640]  it's very interesting this pollster said, sir, if you're down three, four, five
[38:44.640 --> 38:48.960]  people vote, when you go down 17, they say, let's save, let's go and have dinner,
[38:48.960 --> 38:53.600]  and let's watch the presidential defeat tonight on television, darling.
[38:53.600 --> 38:58.400]  And just like the radical left tries to blacklist you on social media,
[38:58.400 --> 39:02.880]  every time I put out a tweet, that's even if it's totally correct,
[39:02.880 --> 39:09.440]  totally correct, I get a flag. I get a flag. And they also don't let you get out.
[39:09.440 --> 39:13.040]  You know, on Twitter, it's very hard to come onto my account.
[39:13.040 --> 39:17.600]  It's very hard to get out of message. They don't let the message get out
[39:17.600 --> 39:22.080]  nearly like they should. But I've had many people say, I can't get on your Twitter.
[39:22.080 --> 39:26.080]  I don't care about Twitter. Twitter is bad news. They're all bad news.
[39:26.080 --> 39:29.360]  But you know what? If you want to get out of message,
[39:29.360 --> 39:32.880]  and if you want to go through big tech, social media,
[39:32.880 --> 39:36.480]  they are really, if you're a conservative, if you're a Republican, if you have a big
[39:36.480 --> 39:39.280]  voice, I guess they call it shadow ban, right?
[39:39.280 --> 39:44.240]  Shadow ban. They shadow ban you. And it should be illegal.
[39:44.240 --> 39:51.680]  I've been telling these Republicans, get rid of section 230.
[39:51.680 --> 39:55.920]  And for some reason, Mitch and the group, they don't want to put it in there.
[39:55.920 --> 40:00.640]  And they don't realize that that's going to be the end of the Republican Party
[40:00.640 --> 40:05.120]  as we know it, but it's never going to be the end of us, never.
[40:05.120 --> 40:11.120]  Let them get out. Let the weak ones get out. This is a time for strength.
[40:11.120 --> 40:15.600]  They also want to indoctrinate your children in school by teaching them
[40:15.600 --> 40:19.920]  things that aren't so. They want to indoctrinate your children.
[40:19.920 --> 40:24.480]  It's all part of the comprehensive assault on our democracy
[40:24.480 --> 40:28.000]  and the American people are finally standing up
[40:28.000 --> 40:32.080]  and saying, no, this crowd is, again, testament to it.
[40:32.080 --> 40:36.480]  I did no advertising. I did nothing. You do have some groups that are big supporters.
[40:36.480 --> 40:40.800]  I want to thank that, Amy and everybody. We have some incredible supporters,
[40:40.800 --> 40:44.560]  incredible, but we didn't do anything. We have pre-programmed commercial breaks,
[40:44.560 --> 40:48.400]  but we'll keep our interjections to an absolute minimum. We'll be right back in
[40:48.400 --> 40:52.080]  just a minute or so to hear more from the President of the United States
[40:52.080 --> 40:55.760]  live from the White House addressing the Save America March.
[40:55.760 --> 41:00.960]  Hey, Alex, how you doing, man? Is this the guy that called in about living defense?
[41:00.960 --> 41:05.040]  Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I've been trying to get a hold of you since Monday.
[41:05.040 --> 41:09.600]  When I heard you got that fresh shipment of living defense in from Utah,
[41:09.600 --> 41:13.280]  I said, man, I got to get on that show and give him an update.
[41:13.280 --> 41:18.560]  I said, if I ever get a chance to be on Alex Jones' show, I'm gonna tell the world
[41:18.560 --> 41:24.240]  about living defense and what it did for me personally. Now, look, I'm 64 years old going
[41:24.240 --> 41:30.880]  on 20 thanks to this info or store product. And by the way, I bought $800 worth the other night.
[41:30.880 --> 41:36.960]  So I'm doing what I can, brother. So what my convention is, why don't we start this new year
[41:36.960 --> 41:42.720]  all-pray with everybody getting a couple bottles of living defense? Now, you got to follow that up
[41:42.720 --> 41:47.840]  with the Microsoft VX. I learned that. So it's like God working is so amazing.
[41:47.840 --> 41:52.720]  We didn't know. We didn't spring your call. We had no idea. And I go to you a year later
[41:52.720 --> 41:58.880]  and you're telling me about living defense, living defense. The word apocalypse means
[41:59.520 --> 42:06.160]  the revealing of what was once hidden. And now that all the lies are being revealed,
[42:06.880 --> 42:14.640]  what will you do? We know that millions will do absolutely nothing. They will do whatever they
[42:14.640 --> 42:22.480]  are told as if obedience is a virtue. It is the Patriots of the world versus everybody else.
[42:23.680 --> 42:30.400]  I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States
[42:30.400 --> 42:37.520]  against all enemies, foreign and domestic, that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same,
[42:37.520 --> 42:44.000]  that I take this obligation freely without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion.
[42:44.000 --> 42:50.640]  And that I will well and faithfully discharge my duties as best as I can. So help me God.
[43:14.720 --> 43:19.040]  Restoratory function. It's amazing. Folks absolutely love it. And again,
[43:19.040 --> 43:23.680]  France has been shut down so we couldn't get it. Now a limited supply is back in stock.
[43:23.680 --> 43:30.080]  25% off at infowarstore.com. Pollen Block again is available in this one minute ad.
[43:30.080 --> 43:34.160]  I don't have time to tell you all about it. But believe me, I have really wanted it back in because
[43:34.160 --> 43:39.360]  it works naturally unlike some of the stuff that's over the counter that makes you all be speedy and
[43:39.360 --> 43:44.080]  irritable and gives you a headache. This is naturally occurring. It's the secret of how the quail
[43:44.640 --> 43:50.160]  don't have the seasonal distress. It's passed on somehow through their eggs to us. Chew up the
[43:50.160 --> 43:56.000]  pills. They taste great. It's available again infowarstore.com. Pollen Block. infowarstore.com.

[44:01.520 --> 44:07.120]  bankrupt you and your family and to make you so poor you're forced on to a universal guaranteed
[44:07.120 --> 44:12.080]  income or synoculations and you must pledge allegiance to the leftist global assistance.
[44:12.080 --> 44:17.840]  That's why it's important to pray to God, be politically active and get prepared for self-defense
[44:17.840 --> 44:23.440]  and to be able to store food and other emergency products that you and your family need so you're
[44:23.440 --> 44:27.360]  not dependent on the system. We have the best storeable food, the lowest price you're going to

[45:06.880 --> 45:20.320]  News. Analysis. Reports. It's the Alex Jones show. Welcome back folks. We go live directly to Donald
[45:20.320 --> 45:25.920]  Trump president of the United States addressing his supporters in Washington D.C. Signatures in
[45:26.800 --> 45:33.440]  Fulton County. They won't let us do it. The only reason they won't is because we'll find things
[45:33.440 --> 45:39.840]  in the hundreds of thousands. Why wouldn't they let us verify signatures in Fulton County?
[45:39.840 --> 45:45.600]  Which is known for being very corrupt. They won't do it. They go to some other county where you
[45:45.600 --> 45:52.640]  would live. I said that's not the problem. The problem is Fulton County. Home of Stacey Abrams.
[45:52.640 --> 45:57.360]  She did a good job. I congratulate her but it was done in such a way that we can't let this
[45:57.360 --> 46:03.600]  stuff happen. We won't have a country if it happens. As a result, Georgia's absentee ballot rejection
[46:03.600 --> 46:14.320]  rate was more than 10 times lower than previous levels because the criteria was so off. 48 counties
[46:14.320 --> 46:22.080]  in Georgia with thousands and thousands of votes rejected zero ballots. There wasn't one ballot.
[46:22.080 --> 46:27.440]  In other words, in a year in which more mail-in ballots were sent than ever before and more people
[46:27.440 --> 46:33.520]  were voting by mail for the first time, the rejection rate was drastically lower than it
[46:33.520 --> 46:40.320]  had ever been before. The only way this can be explained is if tens of thousands of illegitimate
[46:40.320 --> 46:45.760]  votes were added to the tally. That's the only way you can explain it. By the way, you're talking
[46:45.760 --> 46:52.640]  about tens of thousands. If Georgia had merely rejected the same number of unlawful ballots
[46:52.640 --> 46:59.840]  as in other years, there should have been approximately 45,000 ballots rejected far more
[46:59.840 --> 47:06.000]  than what we needed to win, just over 11,000. They should find those votes. They should absolutely
[47:06.000 --> 47:14.160]  find that. Just over 11,000 votes, that's all we need. They defrauded us out of a win in Georgia.
[47:14.160 --> 47:20.560]  And we're not going to forget it. There's only one reason the Democrats could possibly want to
[47:20.560 --> 47:27.520]  eliminate signature matching, oppose voter ID and stop citizenship confirmation. Are you a
[47:27.520 --> 47:33.040]  citizenship? You're not allowed to ask that question because they want to steal the election.
[47:33.920 --> 47:41.040]  The radical left knows exactly what they're doing. They're ruthless, and it's time that somebody did
[47:41.040 --> 47:47.600]  something about it. And Mike Pence, I hope you're going to stand up for the good of our Constitution
[47:47.600 --> 47:53.120]  and for the good of our country. And if you're not, I'm going to be very disappointed in you.
[47:53.120 --> 48:00.320]  I will tell you right now. I'm not hearing good stories. In Fulton County, Republican poll
[48:00.320 --> 48:07.520]  watchers were ejected, in some cases physically, from the room under the false pretense of a pipe
[48:07.520 --> 48:15.360]  burst. Water main burst, everybody leaned, which we now know was a total lie. Then election officials
[48:15.920 --> 48:21.600]  pulled boxes, Democrats, and sued cases of ballots out from under a table, your sort on
[48:21.600 --> 48:28.400]  television, totally fraudulent, and illegally scanned them for nearly two hours, totally unsupervised.
[48:29.120 --> 48:37.200]  Tens of thousands of votes, this act coincided with a mysterious vote dump of up to 100,000
[48:37.200 --> 48:44.960]  votes for Joe Biden, almost none for Trump. Oh, that sounds fair. That was at 1.34 a.m.
[48:46.560 --> 48:52.160]  The Georgia Secretary of State and pathetic governor of Georgia, although he says I'm a
[48:52.160 --> 48:57.120]  great president, you know, I sort of maybe have to change. He said the other day, yes, I don't,
[48:57.120 --> 49:03.600]  I disagree with president, but he's been a great president. Oh, good. Thank you very much. Because
[49:03.600 --> 49:10.400]  of him and others, your Brian Kemp, vote him the hell out of office, please. Well, his rates are
[49:10.400 --> 49:16.480]  so low, you know, his approval rating now, I think it just reads record low. They've rejected five
[49:16.480 --> 49:23.520]  separate appeals for an independent and comprehensive audit of signatures in Fulton County, even without
[49:23.520 --> 49:29.680]  an audit, the number of fraudulent ballots that we've identified across the state is staggering.
[49:29.680 --> 49:36.640]  Over 10,300 ballots in Georgia were cast by individuals whose names in dates of birth matched
[49:36.640 --> 49:44.960]  Georgia residents who died in 2020 and prior to the election. More than 2,500 ballots were cast by
[49:44.960 --> 49:52.400]  individuals whose names in dates of birth match incarcerated felons in Georgia prison, people
[49:52.400 --> 49:59.200]  who are not allowed to vote. More than 4,500 illegal ballots were cast by individuals who do not
[49:59.200 --> 50:06.400]  appear on the state's own voter rolls. Over 18,000 illegal ballots were cast by individuals
[50:06.400 --> 50:12.960]  who registered to vote using an address listed as vacant, according to the Postal Service.
[50:13.600 --> 50:21.760]  At least 88,000 ballots in Georgia were cast by people whose registrations were illegally
[50:21.760 --> 50:30.240]  backdated. 66,000 votes, each one of these is far more than we need. 66,000 votes in Georgia
[50:30.240 --> 50:36.400]  were cast by individuals under the legal voting age, and at least 15,000 ballots were cast by
[50:36.400 --> 50:42.160]  individuals who moved out of the state prior to November 3rd election. They say they moved right
[50:42.160 --> 50:46.480]  back. They moved right back. Oh, they moved out. They moved right back. Okay. They missed Georgia
[50:46.480 --> 50:52.720]  that much. I do. I love Georgia, but it's a corrupt system. Despite all of this, the margin
[50:53.360 --> 51:01.840]  in Georgia is only 11,779 votes. Each and every one of these issues is enough to give us
[51:03.680 --> 51:10.720]  a victory in Georgia, a big, beautiful victory. Make no mistake, this election was stolen from
[51:10.720 --> 51:16.720]  you, from me, and from the country, and not a single swing state has conducted a comprehensive
[51:16.720 --> 51:23.520]  audit to remove the illegal ballots. This should absolutely occur in every single contested state
[51:23.520 --> 51:31.120]  before the election is certified. In the state of Arizona, over 36,000 ballots were illegally cast
[51:31.120 --> 51:39.280]  by non-citizens. 2,000 ballots were returned with no address. More than 22,000 ballots were returned
[51:39.280 --> 51:44.400]  before they were ever supposedly mailed out. They returned, but we haven't mailed them yet.
[51:45.280 --> 51:52.480]  11,600 more ballots and votes were counted. More than there were actual voters. You see that?
[51:52.480 --> 52:00.640]  So you have more votes again than you have voters. 150,000 people registered in Mayacopa County
[52:00.640 --> 52:09.200]  after the registration deadline. 103,000 ballots in the county were sent for electronic adjudication
[52:09.200 --> 52:14.960]  with no Republican observers. In Claw County, Nevada, the accuracy settings on signature
[52:14.960 --> 52:23.520]  verification machines were purposely lowered before they were used to count over 130,000
[52:23.520 --> 52:30.400]  ballots. If you signed your name as Santa Claus, it would go through. There were also more than
[52:30.400 --> 52:41.760]  42,000 double votes in Nevada. Over 150,000 people were hurt so badly by what took place.
[52:41.760 --> 52:49.120]  And 1,500 ballots were cast by individuals whose names and dates of birth matched Nevada residents
[52:49.120 --> 52:56.640]  who died in 2020 prior to November 3rd election. More than 8,000 votes were cast by individuals
[52:56.640 --> 53:04.480]  who had no address and probably didn't live there. The margin in Nevada is down at a very low number.
[53:04.480 --> 53:09.840]  Any of these things would have taken care of the situation. We would have won Nevada also.
[53:09.840 --> 53:15.520]  Every one of these were going over. We win. In Michigan, quickly, the Secretary of State,
[53:15.520 --> 53:21.840]  a real great one, flooded the state with unsolicited mail-in ballot applications sent to every person
[53:21.840 --> 53:28.880]  on the rolls. Indirect violation of state law. More than 17,000 Michigan ballots were cast by
[53:28.880 --> 53:35.760]  individuals whose names and dates of birth matched people who were deceased. In Wayne County, that's
[53:35.760 --> 53:44.160]  a great one. That's Detroit. 174,000 ballots were counted without being tied to an actual registered
[53:44.160 --> 53:49.600]  voter. Nobody knows where they came from. Also, in Wayne County, poll watches observed.
[53:49.600 --> 53:57.360]  Canvassers rescanning batches of ballots over and over again, up to three or four or five times.
[53:57.360 --> 54:07.360]  In Detroit, turnout was 139 percent of registered voters. Think of that. So, you had 139 percent
[54:07.360 --> 54:14.080]  of the people in Detroit voting. This is in Michigan. Detroit, Michigan. A career employee of the
[54:14.080 --> 54:21.520]  Detroit. City of Detroit testified under penalty of perjury that she witnessed city workers
[54:21.520 --> 54:28.960]  coaching voters to vote straight Democrat while accompanying them to watch who they voted for.
[54:28.960 --> 54:35.360]  When a Republican came in, they wouldn't talk to him. The same worker was instructed not to ask
[54:35.360 --> 54:42.560]  for any voter ID and not to attempt to validate any signatures if they were Democrats. She also
[54:42.560 --> 54:49.200]  told to illegally and was told back date ballots received after the deadline and reports that
[54:49.200 --> 54:56.480]  thousands and thousands of ballots were improperly backdated. That's Michigan. Four witnesses have
[54:56.480 --> 55:02.800]  testified under penalty of perjury that after officials in Detroit announced the last votes
[55:03.360 --> 55:09.680]  had been counted, tens of thousands of additional ballots arrived without required envelopes.
[55:09.680 --> 55:16.720]  Every single one was for a Democrat. I got no votes. At 6.31 a.m. in the early morning
[55:16.720 --> 55:26.960]  hours after voting, it ended. Michigan suddenly reported 147,000 votes and astounding 94 percent
[55:26.960 --> 55:34.160]  went to Joe Biden, who campaigned brilliantly from his basement. Trump is laying out the numbers in
[55:34.160 --> 55:38.880]  black and white in front of the White House in Washington, D.C. We have to go to a quick commercial
[55:38.880 --> 55:43.440]  break. It'll be one minute long and we'll be back immediately with more of the president's speech.
[55:43.440 --> 55:49.840]  We'll be right back. Stay with us, please. Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[55:49.840 --> 55:55.680]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept. If you have a family member
[55:55.680 --> 56:01.120]  suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from
[56:01.120 --> 56:08.000]  InfoWarsStore.com. Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly
[56:08.000 --> 56:13.440]  lower blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque,
[56:13.440 --> 56:19.680]  and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[56:19.680 --> 56:26.960]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by
[56:26.960 --> 56:33.600]  increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells. It worked for my family and now I
[56:33.600 --> 56:40.080]  can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality. Get your
[56:40.080 --> 57:06.080]  ultimate fish oil for a friend's family member or yourself at InfoWarsStore.com.
[57:10.640 --> 57:14.160]  And that's who Klaus Schwab is. You might want to look into the guy that says they've watched
[57:14.800 --> 57:18.560]  the COVID-19 lockdowns to bankrupt you and make you poor. You might want to find out
[57:18.560 --> 57:24.640]  who this super villain is. He believes because he's hidden playing you and you're not speaking
[57:24.640 --> 57:28.320]  out against it that he has the right to do it to you. You might want to find out who he works for.
[57:28.320 --> 57:33.120]  He works directly for Prince Charles. He developed since the 80s the plan for global
[57:33.120 --> 57:39.680]  sustainability. That means worldwide NEO feudalism in his own works. So you might want to find out
[57:39.680 --> 57:43.280]  how he talks about using vaccines to sterilize you before you take those shots.
[57:43.280 --> 57:46.000]  You might just want to find out who this villain is. All right.
[57:50.240 --> 57:52.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[57:52.960 --> 58:12.560]  Welcome back folks. Second hour of the Alex Jones show has begun. We go live back to Donald Trump
[58:12.560 --> 58:18.160]  in front of the White House laying out in stark detail the hundreds of thousands of inconsistencies
[58:18.160 --> 58:23.600]  that have yet to been addressed by the mainstream media. President Trump going way down to 17,000
[58:24.160 --> 58:32.640]  and Biden going way up to 29,391. And that was very quick. A 12,000 vote switch all in
[58:32.640 --> 58:40.000]  Mr. Biden's favor. So I mean I could go on and on about this fraud that took place in every state
[58:40.720 --> 58:46.560]  and all of these legislatures want this back. I don't want to do it to you because I love you
[58:46.560 --> 58:52.960]  and it's freezing out here. But I could just go on forever. I can tell you this.
[59:06.080 --> 59:11.920]  So when you hear, when you hear, while there is no evidence to prove any wrongdoing,
[59:11.920 --> 59:16.720]  this is the most fraudulent thing anybody said. This is a criminal enterprise.
[59:17.680 --> 59:23.120]  This is a criminal enterprise. And the press will say, and I'm sure they won't put any of
[59:23.120 --> 59:28.960]  that on there because that's no good. Have you ever seen while there is no evidence to back
[59:28.960 --> 59:35.040]  President Trump's assertion, I could go on for another hour reading this stuff to you
[59:35.040 --> 59:39.600]  and telling you about it. There's never been anything like it. Think about it.
[59:39.600 --> 59:48.160]  Detroit had more votes than it had voters. Pennsylvania had 205,000 more votes than it had
[59:48.160 --> 59:53.280]  more. But you don't have to go any that between that. I think that's almost better than dead people
[59:53.280 --> 59:59.920]  if you think, right? More votes than they had voters and many other states also. It's a disgrace
[59:59.920 --> 1:00:07.120]  that the United States of America, tens of millions of people are allowed to go vote without so much
[1:00:07.120 --> 1:00:16.240]  as even showing identification. In no state is there any question or effort made to verify
[1:00:16.240 --> 1:00:23.200]  the identity, citizenship, residency or eligibility of the votes cast. The Republicans
[1:00:23.200 --> 1:00:26.560]  have to get tougher. You're not going to have a Republican party if you don't get tougher.
[1:00:27.200 --> 1:00:31.840]  They want to play so straight. They want to play so serious. The United States,
[1:00:31.840 --> 1:00:37.600]  the Constitution doesn't allow me to send them back to the states. Well, I say, yes, it does
[1:00:37.600 --> 1:00:42.720]  because the Constitution says you have to protect our country and you have to protect our Constitution
[1:00:42.720 --> 1:00:48.160]  and you can't vote on fraud. And fraud breaks up everything, doesn't it? When you catch somebody
[1:00:48.160 --> 1:00:55.840]  in a fraud, you're allowed to go by very different rules. So I hope Mike has the courage to do what
[1:00:55.840 --> 1:01:01.920]  he has to do. And I hope he doesn't listen to the rhinos and the stupid people that he's listening to.
[1:01:02.880 --> 1:01:08.960]  It is also widely understood that the voter rolls are crammed full of non-citizens, felons,
[1:01:08.960 --> 1:01:14.240]  and people who have moved out of state and individuals who are otherwise ineligible to vote.
[1:01:14.880 --> 1:01:20.080]  Yet Democrats oppose every effort to clean up their voter rolls. They don't want to clean them up.
[1:01:20.080 --> 1:01:26.480]  They're loaded. And how many people here know other people that when the hundreds of thousands
[1:01:26.480 --> 1:01:32.880]  and then millions of ballots got sent out, got three, four, five, six, and I heard one who got seven
[1:01:32.880 --> 1:01:41.760]  ballots? And then they say, you didn't quite make it, sir. We won in a landslide. This was a landslide.
[1:01:41.760 --> 1:01:50.000]  They said it's not American to challenge the election. This is the most corrupt election
[1:01:50.000 --> 1:01:54.640]  in the history, maybe of the world. You know, you could go third world countries, but I don't think
[1:01:54.640 --> 1:02:00.400]  they had hundreds of thousands of votes and they don't have voters for them. I mean, no matter
[1:02:00.400 --> 1:02:05.520]  where you go, nobody would think this. In fact, it's so egregious. It's so bad that a lot of people
[1:02:05.520 --> 1:02:12.160]  don't even believe it. It's so crazy that people don't even believe it. It can't be true. So they
[1:02:12.160 --> 1:02:18.960]  don't believe it. This is not just a matter of domestic politics. This is a matter of national
[1:02:18.960 --> 1:02:25.680]  security. So today, in addition to challenging the certification of the election, I'm calling on
[1:02:25.680 --> 1:02:32.640]  Congress and the state legislatures to quickly pass sweeping election reforms and you better do it
[1:02:32.640 --> 1:02:41.120]  before we have no country left. Today is not the end. It's just the beginning. With your help over
[1:02:41.120 --> 1:02:46.160]  the last four years, we've built the greatest political movement in the history of our country
[1:02:46.160 --> 1:02:50.080]  and nobody even challenged. We'll be right back, but it's the 62nd break and we return live from
[1:02:50.080 --> 1:02:53.920]  Washington, DC. It's infowords.com. This is the Alex Jones show. We'll be right back.
[1:02:56.480 --> 1:03:01.120]  Due to the COVID lockdown destroying the supply chain, many of the best selling products,
[1:03:01.120 --> 1:03:05.600]  infowords, are no longer available. And I thought that pollen block might be gone forever, but
[1:03:05.600 --> 1:03:11.840]  after eight months, we got about 25% of the order we put in delivered to us. The rest, they hope,
[1:03:11.840 --> 1:03:18.960]  in a few months comes in. It's a proprietary system using specially fed quail and their eggs.
[1:03:18.960 --> 1:03:24.400]  It's very powerful when it comes to blocking seasonal irritants and a lot more. So get your
[1:03:24.400 --> 1:03:30.560]  pollen block back in stock at infowarstore.com today. And by the way, activate a charcoal
[1:03:30.560 --> 1:03:34.240]  toothpaste sold out for months. It's now back in stock as well. They're great products and
[1:03:34.240 --> 1:03:38.400]  it funds the info war. So get your pollen block and get your activated charcoal toothpaste

[1:03:43.680 --> 1:03:47.920]  It's concentrated. People love it. It's amazing. There's no toothpaste out there like it.
[1:03:47.920 --> 1:03:52.000]  And pollen block is proprietary as well. You're back in stock infowarstore.com.
[1:03:52.000 --> 1:04:04.480]  Live from the info wars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:04:08.160 --> 1:04:11.920]  Trump is finishing up his remarks in front of the White House. At the same time,
[1:04:11.920 --> 1:04:17.680]  the joint session of the house has begun and we'll bring you both of these as they occur.
[1:04:17.680 --> 1:04:23.280]  We'll go back to Donald Trump as he finishes up and then we'll jump over to Mike Pence as he leads
[1:04:23.280 --> 1:04:29.280]  the Senate. We will stop the practice of universal unsolicited mail-in balloting.
[1:04:29.280 --> 1:04:34.400]  We will clean up the voter rolls that ensure that every single person who casts a vote
[1:04:34.400 --> 1:04:40.640]  is a citizen of our country, a resident of the state in which they vote, and their vote is cast
[1:04:40.640 --> 1:04:48.720]  in a lawful and honest manner. We will restore the vital civic tradition of in-person voting
[1:04:48.720 --> 1:04:55.280]  on election day so that voters can be fully informed when they make their choice. We will
[1:04:55.280 --> 1:05:03.200]  finally hold big tech accountable and if these people had courage and guts, they would get rid
[1:05:03.200 --> 1:05:12.880]  of Section 230, something that no other company, no other person in America in the world has.
[1:05:12.880 --> 1:05:19.840]  All of these tech monopolies are going to abuse their power and interfere in our elections
[1:05:20.560 --> 1:05:25.760]  and it has to be stopped and the Republicans have to get a lot tougher and so should the
[1:05:25.760 --> 1:05:32.160]  Democrats. They should be regulated, investigated, and brought to justice under the fullest extent of
[1:05:32.160 --> 1:05:38.080]  the law. They're totally breaking the law. Together we will drain the Washington swamp
[1:05:38.080 --> 1:05:43.680]  and we will clean up the corruption in our nation's capital. We have done a big job on it,
[1:05:43.680 --> 1:05:48.960]  but you think it's easy? It's a dirty business. It's a dirty business. You have a lot of bad
[1:05:48.960 --> 1:05:55.600]  people out there. Despite everything we've been through, looking out all over this country and
[1:05:55.600 --> 1:06:04.240]  seeing fantastic crowds, although this I think is our all-time record, I think you have 250,000
[1:06:04.240 --> 1:06:12.480]  people, 250,000 looking out at all the amazing patriots here today. I have never been more
[1:06:12.480 --> 1:06:18.400]  confident in our nation's future. Well, I have to say we have to be a little bit careful. That's a
[1:06:18.400 --> 1:06:23.680]  nice statement, but we have to be a little careful with that statement. If we allow this group of
[1:06:23.680 --> 1:06:30.560]  people to illegally take over our country because it's illegal when the votes are illegal, when the
[1:06:30.560 --> 1:06:37.040]  way they got there is illegal, when the states that vote are given false and fraudulent information,
[1:06:37.920 --> 1:06:43.920]  we are the greatest country on earth and we are headed and we're headed in the right direction.
[1:06:43.920 --> 1:06:48.400]  You know, the wall is built. We're doing record numbers at the wall. Now they want to take down
[1:06:48.400 --> 1:06:56.000]  the wall. Let's let everyone flow in. That's let everybody flow in. We did a great job in the
[1:06:56.000 --> 1:07:00.880]  wall. Remember the wall? They said it could never be done. One of the largest infrastructure projects
[1:07:00.880 --> 1:07:05.760]  we've ever had in this country and it's had a tremendous impact that we got rid of tax and
[1:07:05.760 --> 1:07:10.400]  release. We got rid of all of the stuff that we had to live with. But now the caravans,
[1:07:10.400 --> 1:07:15.280]  they think Biden's getting in. The caravans are forming again. They want to come in again and
[1:07:15.280 --> 1:07:22.160]  rip off our country. Can't let it happen. As this enormous crowd shows, we have truth
[1:07:22.160 --> 1:07:27.920]  and justice on our side. We have a deep and enduring love for America in our hearts. We
[1:07:27.920 --> 1:07:34.480]  love our country. We have overwhelming pride in this great country and we have it deep in our
[1:07:34.480 --> 1:07:42.080]  souls. Together we are determined to defend and preserve government of the people, by the people,
[1:07:42.080 --> 1:07:53.680]  and for the people. Our brightest days are before us. Our greatest achievements still wait. I think
[1:07:53.680 --> 1:07:59.440]  one of our great achievements will be election security because nobody until I came along
[1:08:00.000 --> 1:08:05.040]  had any idea how corrupt our elections were. And again, most people would stand there at
[1:08:05.040 --> 1:08:11.200]  nine o'clock in the evening and say, I want to thank you very much. And they go off to some other
[1:08:11.200 --> 1:08:17.200]  life. But I said something's wrong here. Something's really wrong. Can't have happened. And we fight.
[1:08:18.000 --> 1:08:22.640]  We fight like hell. And if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore.
[1:08:23.360 --> 1:08:31.040]  Our exciting adventures and boldest endeavors have not yet begun. My fellow Americans, for our
[1:08:31.040 --> 1:08:39.120]  movement, for our children, and for our beloved country. And I say this, despite all that's happened,
[1:08:39.120 --> 1:08:53.440]  the best is yet to come. So we're going to, we're going to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue. I love
[1:08:53.440 --> 1:09:00.080]  Pennsylvania Avenue. And we're going to the Capitol. And we're going to try and give, the
[1:09:00.080 --> 1:09:06.320]  Democrats are hopeless. They're never voting for anything. Not even one vote. But we're going to
[1:09:06.320 --> 1:09:13.360]  try and give our Republicans the weak ones, because the strong ones don't need any of our help.
[1:09:13.920 --> 1:09:20.640]  We're going to try and give them the kind of pride and boldness that they need to take back
[1:09:20.640 --> 1:09:28.560]  our country. So let's walk down Pennsylvania Avenue. I want to thank you all. God bless you.
[1:09:28.560 --> 1:09:33.920]  And God bless America. Thank you all for being here. This is incredible. Thank you very much.
[1:09:33.920 --> 1:09:39.200]  Donald Trump, President of the United States, finishes up his statements in front of the White
[1:09:39.200 --> 1:09:44.240]  House. At the same time, the joint session of Congress is started. We're going to take the
[1:09:44.240 --> 1:09:49.680]  audio of that now. And Alex Jones, at this moment, is leading the march towards the Capitol
[1:09:49.680 --> 1:09:57.440]  Building, where the Senate and Congress are joining together. Let's go to inside the chamber here.
[1:09:57.440 --> 1:10:06.400]  The report is
[1:10:27.760 --> 1:10:33.920]  that they're now making the words mother and father illegal in legislative bodies. Have you
[1:10:33.920 --> 1:10:40.000]  heard this? Nancy Pelosi has proposed that the words mother and father are illegal.
[1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:44.400]  So I got news for Nancy Pelosi. Donald Trump is here, daddy.
[1:10:47.280 --> 1:10:53.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, Trump said in his speech today, he said the Democrats are out to get us.
[1:10:53.840 --> 1:10:59.520]  They want to destroy us. They want for the globalist. They want to bring America down,
[1:10:59.520 --> 1:11:01.600]  but we're not going to let them do it.
[1:11:05.040 --> 1:11:12.160]  This new system is a military attack. And we need to understand we're under attack.
[1:11:12.160 --> 1:11:17.520]  We need to understand this is 21st century warfare and get on a war footing and not just
[1:11:17.520 --> 1:11:28.240]  take this country back, but take the whole world back from the communist Chinese USA, USA, USA,
[1:11:28.240 --> 1:11:39.600]  USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA.
[1:11:39.600 --> 1:11:45.680]  And so today we march to the Capitol because on this historic January 6th, 2021,
[1:11:45.680 --> 1:11:50.800]  we have to let our congressmen and women know and we have to let Mike Petch know they
[1:11:50.800 --> 1:11:56.400]  stole the election. We know they stole it. We're not going to accept it. Do the right thing,
[1:11:56.400 --> 1:12:02.080]  because there's a million of us here in DC telling you to and you have a constitutional
[1:12:02.080 --> 1:12:07.600]  and legal debt. You have to do it. It's your duty. It's your duty to send this election for being
[1:12:07.600 --> 1:12:09.360]  stolen. So they must do it.
[1:12:09.360 --> 1:12:21.680]  Let's walk down Pennsylvania. This is a live feed from Washington, DC. Right now,
[1:12:21.680 --> 1:12:28.640]  Alex Jones and our own sure speaking to a large crowd. At the same time in the Capitol building,
[1:12:28.640 --> 1:12:34.080]  the word is Mike Pence has rejected Trump's call. He has failed to show the courage that
[1:12:34.080 --> 1:12:40.960]  Donald Trump was attempting to imbue in him and has begun the counting of the electoral votes.
[1:12:42.960 --> 1:12:49.840]  At the same time, there's word that thousands of patriots have broken through the barriers
[1:12:49.840 --> 1:12:54.320]  around the Capitol and are now moving towards it to occupy. That's the word from Elijah Schaefer,
[1:12:54.320 --> 1:12:59.360]  who's on the ground. And Alex Jones continues to speak to this crowd. Let's go back to Alex Jones.
[1:12:59.360 --> 1:13:09.360]  In the great awakening, the great reset is triggering the great awakening. And the great
[1:13:09.360 --> 1:13:15.600]  awakening will trigger the great rebellion and the destruction of the new world order.
[1:13:18.960 --> 1:13:24.000]  We all know that our system has been corrupt for a long time. The whole
[1:13:24.000 --> 1:13:29.040]  world knows our system has been corrupt for a long time. And they've been waiting for Americans to
[1:13:29.040 --> 1:13:33.600]  stand up. And they've been waiting for Alito America to stand up and do the right thing,
[1:13:33.600 --> 1:13:39.120]  expose it, and then bring it to its knees for its ultimate defeat. And that's what we do,
[1:13:39.120 --> 1:13:46.480]  starting now in the year 2021. This is it, folks. Lada from Washington, DC. Mike Pence rejects
[1:13:46.480 --> 1:13:50.880]  Trump's call to overturn Biden election as patriots move towards the Capitol building.
[1:13:50.880 --> 1:13:56.640]  This is it, folks. We'll be back in just a few minutes with it live introducing info wars life

[1:14:20.480 --> 1:14:25.440]  system. The two formulas are different, but both are concentrates. And our first product got

[1:14:56.160 --> 1:14:59.840]  but I'm going to tell you all now if you haven't tried turbo force, you need to try it. I've tried
[1:14:59.840 --> 1:15:05.120]  turbo force with everything. Sometimes, you know, I went a little bit crazy. I put turbo force in my
[1:15:05.120 --> 1:15:09.280]  coffee. That was a crazy week. I don't remember sleeping. But as far as the products go, turbo
[1:15:09.280 --> 1:15:13.200]  force is my favorite. And all the info wars products are down to taking control your life,
[1:15:13.200 --> 1:15:19.200]  take control your health, not relying on other people to do it for you. Nobody wakes up in the
[1:15:19.200 --> 1:15:24.000]  morning and thinks I'm going to give that person over there a better life. I'm going to wake up
[1:15:24.000 --> 1:15:28.160]  today. You know, I'm going to spend my entire day trying to make that guy over there healthier,
[1:15:28.160 --> 1:15:31.840]  happier and richer. I'm going to make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend. I don't think that
[1:15:31.840 --> 1:15:35.120]  happens very often. It's never happened to me. I've never had anyone knock on my door and said,
[1:15:35.120 --> 1:15:38.880]  Tate, you're such a good guy. How can I improve your life in every single way? There's only one
[1:15:38.880 --> 1:15:42.720]  person who woke up and thought that and that was me. I woke up and thought, you know what? Okay,
[1:15:42.720 --> 1:15:45.760]  I want to take control of my life. I want to take control of my health. And that's why you need to
[1:15:45.760 --> 1:15:49.440]  go to info wars.com. Take control of your health right now and support the resistance. Don't buy
[1:15:49.440 --> 1:15:53.440]  into the group. Think don't drink the Kool-Aid drink the turbo force. Kool-Aid is bad. The turbo
[1:15:53.440 --> 1:15:59.520]  force is good. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:15:59.520 --> 1:16:14.400]  All right, welcome back to the Alex Jones show. My name is Harrison Smith. News pouring in from
[1:16:14.400 --> 1:16:19.040]  many different directions right now. Alex Jones and Owen Schreuer are live outside the Capitol
[1:16:19.040 --> 1:16:25.120]  addressing the crowd by bullhorn. Donald Trump has just finished up his speech. The Senate and the
[1:16:25.120 --> 1:16:31.520]  Congress are meeting right now to debate the objections breaking from Elijah Schaeffer.
[1:16:31.520 --> 1:16:35.840]  Patriots have stormed the Capitol building ground and are breaching federal barriers
[1:16:35.840 --> 1:16:41.040]  and police in the masses. No cell service, but video coming non lethal force in effect.
[1:16:41.040 --> 1:16:46.960]  Full unlawful assembly on display. Never seen anything like this insane thousands occupying
[1:16:46.960 --> 1:16:52.880]  and you see the video here of Patriots pushing against the Capitol city police as they move
[1:16:52.880 --> 1:16:58.480]  towards the Capitol building. Estimates upwards of a million Patriots right now have gathered
[1:16:58.480 --> 1:17:04.000]  for this and threaten to overwhelm the defenses of the Capitol building. From the election wizard
[1:17:04.000 --> 1:17:09.840]  on Twitter, 60 congressmen have just objected to the electoral votes from Arizona applause
[1:17:09.840 --> 1:17:15.040]  rung out in the halls of Congress. Vice President Mike Pence released this statement essentially
[1:17:15.680 --> 1:17:21.600]  abrogating the responsibility of rejecting or accepting the electoral votes. He says during
[1:17:21.600 --> 1:17:26.560]  the 130 years since the electoral count act was passed, Congress has without exception used these
[1:17:26.560 --> 1:17:30.640]  formal procedures to count the electoral votes every four years given the controversy surrounding
[1:17:30.640 --> 1:17:36.800]  this year's election. Some approach this year's quadrenal tradition with great expectation and
[1:17:36.800 --> 1:17:42.000]  others with dismissive disdain. Some believe as vice president I should be able to accept or reject
[1:17:42.000 --> 1:17:45.920]  electoral votes unilaterally. Others believe electoral votes should never be challenged in
[1:17:45.920 --> 1:17:50.320]  a joint session of Congress. After careful study of our Constitution, our laws, our history,
[1:17:50.320 --> 1:17:55.360]  I believe neither view is correct and essentially he says he's going to leave it up to the legislatures
[1:17:55.360 --> 1:18:00.800]  and he himself is not going to exert the unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes
[1:18:00.800 --> 1:18:06.160]  should be counted and which should not. While he says, quote, while my role as presiding officer
[1:18:06.160 --> 1:18:11.120]  is largely ceremonial, the role of the Congress is much different and the electoral count of 1887
[1:18:11.120 --> 1:18:16.160]  establishes a clear procedure to address election controversies when they arise during the count
[1:18:16.160 --> 1:18:23.200]  of the vote of the electoral college. Republicans have objected to accepting Arizona's electoral
[1:18:23.200 --> 1:18:28.880]  votes. Senator Ted Cruz and Representative Paul Gosar of Arizona objected to the counting of
[1:18:28.880 --> 1:18:35.360]  electoral votes from Arizona won by Joe Biden. So chaos abounds around the Capitol building.
[1:18:35.360 --> 1:18:40.720]  We are now getting a live feed as Alex Jones continues to lead the march towards the Capitol
[1:18:40.720 --> 1:18:46.160]  building and we are receiving video updates on the ground as it looks like patriots are
[1:18:46.160 --> 1:18:54.320]  threatening to overwhelm the security of the Capitol and break in. Let's go back to Alex Jones
[1:18:54.320 --> 1:19:01.280]  as he marches and we'll continue to get updates here. Again, this is unprecedented in American
[1:19:01.280 --> 1:19:14.880]  history. You can hear the police alarms going off as chaos reigns. Ambulance is moving towards the
[1:19:14.880 --> 1:19:20.160]  scene. You can see there on the right is the old post office building which is now the Trump hotel
[1:19:20.160 --> 1:19:26.080]  which has been a major gathering point for patriots ever since Trump got elected. They're
[1:19:26.080 --> 1:19:33.200]  moving now through Freedom Plaza. You can see this massive stream of humanity. Alex Jones,
[1:19:33.200 --> 1:19:39.600]  Oren Shroyer, Gregory's and others following behind as they march towards the Capitol building
[1:19:39.600 --> 1:19:45.440]  which is already under siege. He and Miles Chong teased out. There's just so many Trump supporters
[1:19:45.440 --> 1:19:51.280]  surrounding the Capitol and you see this massive humanity of as we say estimated a million people
[1:19:51.280 --> 1:19:57.760]  moving to surround the Capitol Oren Shroyer and Alex Jones now speaking through the bullhorn
[1:19:57.760 --> 1:19:59.200]  to the crowds who follow them.
[1:19:59.200 --> 1:20:02.800]  We're coming from all the Army traitors in Congress that have stabbed us in the back.
[1:20:02.800 --> 1:20:08.560]  You stabbed us in the back one too many times. We're coming with truth and justice and non-violent
[1:20:08.560 --> 1:20:20.960]  civil disobedience. This is history happening. We're not giving it to the globalist.
[1:20:20.960 --> 1:20:29.280]  We're never surrendering. This is our country. This is our country, not our corrupt politicians
[1:20:29.280 --> 1:20:35.520]  country. They work for us and it's time they got a friendly reminder who their boss is.
[1:20:35.520 --> 1:20:42.480]  The Communist Chinese and the globalist and Hollywood don't run this country and our
[1:20:42.480 --> 1:20:49.760]  children do not belong in a pedophile church. We will not accept the fact that election
[1:20:49.760 --> 1:20:54.720]  events are a molesting Joe Biden. That Chinese is turning his name into Joe Biden.
[1:20:54.720 --> 1:20:57.920]  We know where he belongs and it's not the White House.
[1:20:57.920 --> 1:21:00.240]  China Joe Biden is a child molester.
[1:21:00.960 --> 1:21:11.040]  China Joe, baby. China Joe has got to go. China Joe has got to go. China Joe has got to go.
[1:21:11.040 --> 1:21:16.960]  China Joe has got to go. China Joe has got to go. China Joe has got to go.
[1:21:41.040 --> 1:21:57.360]  So everybody knew what the rules were. People on both sides knew how to play the rules before
[1:21:57.360 --> 1:22:02.080]  the game started. Not getting somewhere in the process and saying, well, you don't think it's
[1:22:02.080 --> 1:22:08.560]  going to benefit you. So you try to go around the Constitution. That's not how our system works.
[1:22:08.560 --> 1:22:14.960]  It's gotten out of hand. And so President Trump has called this out and President Trump has stood
[1:22:14.960 --> 1:22:21.040]  up to it. So many of us have stood up to it. And in fact, over 100 of my colleagues, Madam
[1:22:21.040 --> 1:22:28.160]  Speaker, asked the Supreme Court to address this problem just a few weeks ago. And unfortunately,
[1:22:28.160 --> 1:22:33.440]  the court chose to punt. They didn't answer one way or the other. They didn't want to get to the
[1:22:33.440 --> 1:22:34.560]  middle of this discussion.
[1:22:34.560 --> 1:22:38.000]  House right now, but here is an update. As of less than a minute ago, Hill staffers have been told
[1:22:38.000 --> 1:22:43.600]  to evacuate the Madison building. Things are getting tenuous here as Trump supporters and
[1:22:43.600 --> 1:22:48.800]  patriots continue to pour towards the Capitol. Alex Jones himself at the head of a massive
[1:22:48.800 --> 1:22:53.760]  column of patriots moving now towards the United States Capitol building. We go back now to Steve
[1:22:53.760 --> 1:22:59.200]  Scalise, who inside the Capitol building is objecting to vote to counting the votes from Arizona.
[1:23:00.640 --> 1:23:05.520]  Every single Republican voted to reform the process. Every single Democrat voted against it.
[1:23:05.520 --> 1:23:14.720]  They don't want to fix this problem. But the Constitution is our guide. And it's time we
[1:23:14.720 --> 1:23:20.160]  start following the Constitution. It's time we get back to what our founding father said is the
[1:23:20.160 --> 1:23:26.480]  process for selecting electors. That's the legislatures in public view, not behind closed
[1:23:26.480 --> 1:23:31.280]  doors, not smoke filled rooms, not bullying somebody that might give you a better ruling.
[1:23:31.280 --> 1:23:37.120]  Let's get back to rule of law and follow the Constitution, Madam Speaker. And I yield back
[1:23:37.120 --> 1:23:38.080]  the balance of my time.
[1:23:39.200 --> 1:23:40.800]  Chairman's time has expired.
[1:23:41.840 --> 1:23:48.560]  At Steve Scalise addressing the Congressional House and objecting to the counting of votes,
[1:23:48.560 --> 1:23:52.960]  Trump supporters are storming the grounds of the Capitol building and have torn down fences,
[1:23:52.960 --> 1:23:58.000]  punches being thrown, mace being sprayed. This is an ongoing situation. Crowds continue to increase
[1:23:58.000 --> 1:24:05.600]  in size as they move towards the Capitol. This is coming from just various different streams.
[1:24:05.600 --> 1:24:10.480]  An evacuation order has been issued for the Madison building. Here you see the Trump supporters
[1:24:10.480 --> 1:24:18.080]  tearing down the fences as this mass of humanity moves towards the Capitol in defiance of the
[1:24:19.120 --> 1:24:24.320]  strictures and boundaries and perimeters being set up. This is a historic day, folks,
[1:24:24.320 --> 1:24:29.360]  for seeing things we have never seen in America before. And we'll bring it all to you up to the
[1:24:29.360 --> 1:24:37.200]  minute updates here on infowars.com, band.video. We are just monitoring all different feeds. We
[1:24:37.200 --> 1:24:42.560]  have our own feed here that's own Shroy with the bullhorn leading a massive column to greet the
[1:24:42.560 --> 1:24:47.440]  already huge crowds at the Capitol building that are threatening to break in. Evacuation
[1:24:47.440 --> 1:24:56.240]  orders being issued and the congressmen continue to object. This is incredible, folks. Stay with us.
[1:25:17.440 --> 1:25:27.040]  I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States
[1:25:27.040 --> 1:25:33.200]  against all enemies, foreign and domestic, that I will bear true faith and allegiance
[1:25:33.200 --> 1:25:39.840]  to the same, that I take this obligation freely without any mental reservation or purpose of
[1:25:39.840 --> 1:25:46.880]  evasion, and that I will well and faithfully discharge my duties as best as I can. So help me,
[1:25:46.880 --> 1:25:56.480]  God. infowars.com, band.video. Our activated charcoal toothpaste became a best-seller overnight
[1:25:56.480 --> 1:26:01.120]  because activated charcoal is already one of the top-selling fastest-growing toothpaste out there.
[1:26:01.120 --> 1:26:05.840]  The problem is a lot of the other over-the-counter ones have aspartame as their flavoring, very,
[1:26:05.840 --> 1:26:10.080]  very toxic, and also they have fluoride in it. This does not have the fluoride. It doesn't have
[1:26:10.080 --> 1:26:14.960]  the additives. This is a concentrated, it really is, high quality. It's been sold out for months
[1:26:14.960 --> 1:26:19.920]  because of supply chain breakdowns with the whole COVID martial law garbage, but now it's back in

[1:26:56.080 --> 1:27:02.000]  coming, especially if the globalists are successful in killing the dollar. Tens of millions of Americans
[1:27:02.000 --> 1:27:08.160]  that were not awake are now beginning to store food. That's a good thing, but it's going to drive up
[1:27:08.160 --> 1:27:14.160]  prices and we're already beginning to see record sales once again. We the people understand it's
[1:27:14.160 --> 1:27:19.600]  up to us to protect ourselves. It's up to us to become self-sufficient. The globalists are waging
[1:27:19.600 --> 1:27:25.200]  siege against us, trying to destroy our businesses, trying to bankrupt our families, our towns,
[1:27:25.200 --> 1:27:30.800]  our churches. That's why, while we still can, we've got to get prepared and get ready. Take

[1:28:16.160 --> 1:28:25.280]  This is a historic day, ladies and gentlemen. Incredible things happening. They're storming
[1:28:25.280 --> 1:28:31.680]  DC. Patriots are rushing and surrounding the Capitol. They're tearing down barriers. Police
[1:28:31.680 --> 1:28:37.840]  are struggling to maintain the crowd. Mace and punches being thrown back and forth. Two
[1:28:39.520 --> 1:28:44.400]  house buildings have been evacuated. The House Cannon Building and the House Madison Building
[1:28:44.400 --> 1:28:51.120]  have both been issued evacuation orders. Pence has said he cannot reject electoral votes outright,
[1:28:51.120 --> 1:28:57.760]  but the Congress themselves are objecting right now to the Arizona votes. Video's coming out
[1:28:58.720 --> 1:29:06.560]  over Twitter, and we'll bring you those just as soon as we can of the conflict, the combat
[1:29:06.560 --> 1:29:11.680]  actually going on, with the Capitol Police being pushed back, barriers being torn down,
[1:29:11.680 --> 1:29:17.600]  and Patriots waving Trump flags, American flags, Don't Tread on Me flags, the Gadsden flag all
[1:29:18.240 --> 1:29:23.360]  moving inexorably towards the Capitol Building. Alex Jones and Owen Schreuer are at the head of
[1:29:23.360 --> 1:29:28.080]  a second column of humanity moving towards the Capitol Building less than a mile away. Now,
[1:29:28.080 --> 1:29:33.520]  there's the evacuation order you see from the United States Capitol Police. Evacuate Madison
[1:29:33.520 --> 1:29:38.560]  Building due to police activity occupants should remain calm and move in a safe manner to the exits
[1:29:38.560 --> 1:29:43.920]  if nearby. Take annunciators on the way out, closed doors behind you, but do not lock proceed
[1:29:43.920 --> 1:29:48.880]  immediately to your designated assembly area and check in with your OEC. These are the orders
[1:29:48.880 --> 1:29:54.720]  being issued to the members of the House and anybody there in the Capitol Building, that's
[1:29:54.720 --> 1:30:00.720]  the Madison Building and the Cannon Building, both received evacuation orders as a consequence
[1:30:00.720 --> 1:30:07.840]  of this massive humanity that continues to blast their way through the flimsy barriers,
[1:30:07.840 --> 1:30:12.880]  preventing them from getting close to the Capitol. Incredible stuff, folks. Here we're seeing videos
[1:30:13.600 --> 1:30:19.680]  that are being transmitted to us minute by minute as we receive updates from people on the ground,
[1:30:19.680 --> 1:30:25.120]  independent journalists, and just regular people alike. Meanwhile, and here you see them pulling
[1:30:25.120 --> 1:30:29.440]  the barriers and the police struggling to pull it back. This is not Black Lives Matter, folks.
[1:30:29.440 --> 1:30:36.000]  This is not Antifa. These are Patriots and perhaps they've finally boiled over. You see the air
[1:30:36.000 --> 1:30:42.560]  filled with the mist of mace, the stinging gas that the police will be implementing and that is
[1:30:42.560 --> 1:30:48.480]  also being implemented against the police as Patriots, wow, receiving blows to the head from
[1:30:48.480 --> 1:30:54.240]  billy clubs, attempts to tear down barriers. But once again, folks, this is but a small fraction of
[1:30:54.240 --> 1:30:59.680]  the upwards of a million people that are now in Washington, D.C. with the vast majority of them
[1:30:59.680 --> 1:31:05.760]  just now moving towards the Capitol. We expect this situation to become ever more dire. Here we
[1:31:05.760 --> 1:31:12.320]  see once again moving past what looks like the Museum of Natural History, perhaps the Aaron
[1:31:12.320 --> 1:31:17.840]  Space Museum, closing in on the Capitol, a column of humanity being led by Alex Jones with his
[1:31:17.840 --> 1:31:23.840]  iconic bullhorn and Owen Schreuer next to him. The sheer number of people there makes it almost
[1:31:23.840 --> 1:31:29.920]  impossible to get signal out and that's the only thing really preventing us from getting completely
[1:31:29.920 --> 1:31:34.560]  live feeds right now, but we're getting them about as quickly as we can. Fights have broken out
[1:31:34.560 --> 1:31:39.760]  between police officers and Trump supporters in front of the Capitol. Right now, Jim Jordan is
[1:31:39.760 --> 1:31:46.080]  objecting to counting the electoral votes from Arizona. Let's go down to Jim Jordan and hear
[1:31:46.080 --> 1:31:55.440]  what he has to say. What if it's 10 states next time? What if it's 15? What if in 2024, 2028,
[1:31:55.440 --> 1:32:01.600]  it's 26 states? What if it's half the states doing in run around the Constitution clearly spells out?
[1:32:01.600 --> 1:32:09.760]  But we, we are the final check and balance. The authority rests with us, the United States
[1:32:09.760 --> 1:32:14.480]  Congress, the body closest to the American people, right where the founders wanted it.
[1:32:15.360 --> 1:32:21.360]  We should do our duty. We should object to and vote for this objection to the Arizona
[1:32:22.080 --> 1:32:25.440]  electors. Madam Chair, I yield back. Thank you.
[1:32:25.440 --> 1:32:31.280]  Thank you. That's Jim Jordan objecting and laying out his reasonings for object, for objection
[1:32:31.280 --> 1:32:36.640]  against this Arizona. So they go state by state to count the electors as of now. Only 12 have been
[1:32:36.640 --> 1:32:42.640]  counted. I believe that's just from Alaska. So Trump right now has those 12 electors. Biden's
[1:32:42.640 --> 1:32:48.160]  still at zero as he would be awarded the Arizona delegates, except there has been an objection.
[1:32:48.160 --> 1:32:54.240]  And now there's time for a debate. Adam Schiff now presenting what I'm sure it can be summarized as
[1:32:54.240 --> 1:33:01.840]  BS, American Nationalists on Twitter, asking President Trump to storm the Senate chamber.
[1:33:01.840 --> 1:33:08.560]  This day is young folks and who knows what will be, what the future holds for us. Again, Elijah
[1:33:08.560 --> 1:33:12.480]  Schaffer reports, patriots have stormed the Capitol building, ground and are breaching
[1:33:12.480 --> 1:33:17.280]  federal barriers and police en masse. No cell service, video income. Of course, we've seen
[1:33:17.280 --> 1:33:23.520]  that video. We played it for you here. Non-lethal force in effect. The barriers are continually
[1:33:23.520 --> 1:33:29.440]  being assaulted by the patriots as they move ever closer and surround an ever greater number.
[1:33:29.440 --> 1:33:34.880]  The Capitol building in Washington, D.C. punches mace being thrown. And again, the only thing
[1:33:34.880 --> 1:33:39.040]  preventing us from getting more videos right now is the fact that the sheer mass of humanity
[1:33:39.040 --> 1:33:44.320]  overloads the cell phone towers and it becomes impossible to get access to the Internet or even
[1:33:44.320 --> 1:33:49.760]  to call in. We're going to try to get the stream of Alex Jones and Owen Schreuer as they continue
[1:33:49.760 --> 1:33:53.680]  to approach. It looks like blood on the ground. I'm not sure if that's blood or something else,
[1:33:53.680 --> 1:33:58.240]  but it looked like a great deal of human blood on the ground in front of the police line.
[1:33:58.880 --> 1:34:04.560]  As police continue to lash out and attack there in full riot gear, full armor, patriots, no sign
[1:34:05.200 --> 1:34:10.160]  of stepping back or slowing down as they continue to push towards these police lines.
[1:34:10.160 --> 1:34:15.120]  Of course, inside this building right now, the debate rages. Adam Schiff presenting some sort of
[1:34:15.120 --> 1:34:20.800]  illiterate nonsense that we don't need to hear. Patriots storming the U.S. Capitol, an amazing
[1:34:20.800 --> 1:34:30.400]  video from The Real Hearstie via Kitty Boomhauer on Twitter. These are the people we rely on to
[1:34:30.400 --> 1:34:36.880]  get this up-to-date video because, folks, if you were watching Fox News or Newsmax or CNN,
[1:34:36.880 --> 1:34:43.440]  you would receive nothing but a bland feed of essentially nothing going on. Instead,
[1:34:43.440 --> 1:34:50.240]  we are giving you live, up-to-the-minute videos that are coming through over Twitter from the
[1:34:50.240 --> 1:34:56.720]  live independent reporters there on the ground. Thousands, hundreds of thousands of people
[1:34:56.720 --> 1:35:02.160]  right now moving towards the Capitol. The mass of humanity continues to grow as the police lash
[1:35:02.160 --> 1:35:09.600]  out. They're thin line of armored officers, a pitiful resistance against the literal tidal
[1:35:09.600 --> 1:35:16.480]  wave moving towards them. And we'll continue to monitor all of this and get more videos as well,
[1:35:16.480 --> 1:35:22.080]  folks. Guys, do we have a feed of Alex and Owen moving towards, or has that gone down because
[1:35:22.080 --> 1:35:30.320]  of the cell phones? This is all up-to-the-minute, folks. The crew is working frantically behind
[1:35:30.320 --> 1:35:36.160]  the scenes to get all of this up-to-date. Once again, this is coverage that you will not get
[1:35:36.160 --> 1:35:42.160]  anywhere else. And all of this broke out almost immediately following President Trump's statements.
[1:35:42.160 --> 1:35:50.880]  Is this the live feed of Alex and Owen? Can we hear them? And you see the crowd moving towards
[1:35:50.880 --> 1:35:56.880]  the Capitol now. Owen and Alex at the head of a column of humanity going to join the already
[1:35:56.880 --> 1:36:02.880]  hundreds, if not thousands of people now surrounding the Capitol and pushing ever closer. The Capitol
[1:36:02.880 --> 1:36:08.880]  has evacuated two buildings. The Cannon Building and the Madison Building have received evacuation
[1:36:08.880 --> 1:36:13.760]  orders, and the people inside have been told to move calmly, but swiftly towards the exit
[1:36:13.760 --> 1:36:22.320]  and to notify their superiors that they are safe, folks. This is truly incredible and we'll continue
[1:36:22.320 --> 1:36:30.560]  to keep you updated here. Looks like Chuck Schumer now. No, it's still Adam Schiff addressing the
[1:36:30.560 --> 1:36:37.600]  crowd. And do we have audio of that stream? If we can bring that up and hear what Owen and Alex are saying.
[1:37:01.040 --> 1:37:04.560]  Let's just wait.
[1:37:22.560 --> 1:37:26.000]  Surrounding Alex Jones and Owen Schreuer and the rest of the Info Wars crew as they move
[1:37:26.000 --> 1:37:30.880]  towards the Capitol. Here we see a view from inside the Capitol of staffers there moving
[1:37:30.880 --> 1:37:36.560]  down the stairs following that evacuation order. McConnell has said, quote, if we overrule them,
[1:37:36.560 --> 1:37:41.600]  we damage our Republic forever, folks. The Republic has been damaged. It now teeters on
[1:37:41.600 --> 1:37:46.800]  the brink of collapse. What we're witnessing here live is unprecedented in American history
[1:37:46.800 --> 1:37:59.360]  and Infowars.com is the only place bringing you these videos. Stay with us, folks.
[1:38:16.960 --> 1:38:24.080]  It is an IANA 4 similar to hydroxychloroquine and it helps channel the dink into the cells,
[1:38:24.080 --> 1:38:30.320]  so people might want to take a look at that. All I know is with DNA Force, we went out and
[1:38:30.320 --> 1:38:35.280]  looked at these high-end products that they sell through doctor clinics that aren't prescription,
[1:38:35.280 --> 1:38:38.720]  but the doctor itself like 300 bucks a bottle because there's a lot of expensive product
[1:38:38.720 --> 1:38:43.200]  in them. It's really only cost them like 50 bucks. And so we basically cloned two different top
[1:38:43.200 --> 1:38:46.880]  brands together, and that's what produced this. So thanks. Thanks for the plug.
[1:38:51.840 --> 1:38:56.640]  We are witnessing a perfect dichotomy of psychological warfare. The United Nations,
[1:38:56.640 --> 1:39:00.960]  the big corporations, the globalists, big tech and big farmer, all pushing. The cub is the most
[1:39:00.960 --> 1:39:06.400]  deadly thing in history, even though statistically it's a very weak flu or cold. But if you are
[1:39:06.400 --> 1:39:10.480]  deficient, then you can actually die from it. That's why you see somebody dying inside the nursing
[1:39:10.480 --> 1:39:16.160]  homes. Meanwhile, all these top scientists and researchers and former Pfizer head medical
[1:39:16.160 --> 1:39:20.960]  officers have come out and said that the COVID-19 vaccine, especially the mRNA ones,
[1:39:20.960 --> 1:39:25.200]  are basically bioweapons that are super deadly, and now they're having to resuscitate people that
[1:39:25.200 --> 1:39:29.600]  die basically when they take it just like newborn babies. They give vaccines,
[1:39:29.600 --> 1:39:32.640]  they have to resuscitate them all the time, or a lot of times they just let them die.
[1:39:32.640 --> 1:39:38.160]  And that's on the record. It does that. Guillain-Marais, narcolepsy, cancer, all these other diseases,
[1:39:38.160 --> 1:39:41.760]  but they tell you, save and effective. No one's getting hurt. It's a conspiracy theory. And then
[1:39:41.760 --> 1:39:46.320]  all the fine princess can kill you absolutely deadly. So they run from something that isn't
[1:39:46.320 --> 1:39:50.320]  dangerous towards something that is incredibly dangerous because the media says it's safe. They
[1:39:50.320 --> 1:39:57.200]  do it. Three, two, one. Here we go. It's back in stock. It's been sold out for over eight months.
[1:39:57.200 --> 1:40:00.800]  We couldn't get it because the lockdown pollen block is back in stock. Let me tell you a real
[1:40:00.800 --> 1:40:04.640]  book about it. But the power of quail egg concentrate pollen block acts differently.
[1:40:04.640 --> 1:40:08.000]  The traditional line of history means that it's clinically studied to alleviate seasonal distress
[1:40:08.000 --> 1:40:12.880]  symptoms by helping to clear signage passages and aiding respiratory function. It's amazing.
[1:40:12.880 --> 1:40:17.200]  Folks absolutely love it. And again, France has been shut down, so we couldn't get it.
[1:40:17.200 --> 1:40:24.800]  Now a limited supply is back in stock 25% off at infoworkstore.com. Pollen block again is available
[1:40:24.800 --> 1:40:28.720]  in this one minute ad. I don't have time to tell you all about it, but believe me, I have really
[1:40:28.720 --> 1:40:32.960]  wanted it back in because it works naturally unlike some of the stuff that's over the counter
[1:40:32.960 --> 1:40:38.480]  that makes you all be speedy and irritable and gives you a headache. This is naturally occurring.
[1:40:38.480 --> 1:40:43.280]  It's the secret of how the quail don't have the seasonal distress and it's passed on somehow
[1:40:43.280 --> 1:40:49.680]  through their eggs to us. You chew up the pills. They taste great. It's available again infoworkstore.com
[1:40:49.680 --> 1:40:56.320]  pollen block infoworkstore.com. The great reset is here. World government has openly been announced
[1:40:56.320 --> 1:41:01.520]  and its plan is to bankrupt you and your family and to make you so poor you're forced onto a
[1:41:01.520 --> 1:41:06.720]  universal guaranteed income or synoculations and you must pledge allegiance to the leftist
[1:41:06.720 --> 1:41:12.400]  globalist system. That's why it's important to pray to God, be politically active and get prepared
[1:41:12.400 --> 1:41:18.480]  for self-defense and to be able to store food and other emergency products that you and your family
[1:41:18.480 --> 1:41:22.720]  need so you're not dependent on the system. We have the best storeable food at the lowest price

[1:42:02.640 --> 1:42:20.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is truly incredible. Alex Jones and Owen Shroyer at the head of a
[1:42:20.720 --> 1:42:27.280]  column of patriots moving towards the area where Donald Trump has just completed his speech to the
[1:42:27.280 --> 1:42:33.600]  save America crowd there. My guest, upwards of a million people on the streets of Washington DC
[1:42:33.600 --> 1:42:38.160]  are already hundreds of thousands surrounding the Capitol where inside the debate rages over
[1:42:38.160 --> 1:42:44.320]  whether or not to accept the electoral votes from the state of Arizona. This is just the beginning
[1:42:44.320 --> 1:42:50.880]  and as the debate rages inside outside police are struggling to maintain the fury of the crowds as
[1:42:50.880 --> 1:42:56.960]  barricades are pulled down. Mace is sprayed back and forth punches being thrown by both sides in
[1:42:56.960 --> 1:43:05.040]  what looks like what looks to be a the beginning of something huge folks. We are receiving video
[1:43:05.040 --> 1:43:10.800]  updates from independent reporters on the ground and across the entire country as a rally at the
[1:43:10.800 --> 1:43:17.200]  Minnesota State House in St. Paul has surrounded the Capitol building there and again Alex Jones
[1:43:17.200 --> 1:43:23.520]  and Owen Shroyer moving towards that Capitol with the rest of this massive crowd which by the time
[1:43:23.520 --> 1:43:28.160]  Trump was still speaking had already surrounded the Capitol building. Two of the Capitol buildings
[1:43:28.160 --> 1:43:33.280]  have been evacuated the Madison building and the House Cannon building and both received evacuation
[1:43:33.280 --> 1:43:41.600]  orders and the staffers there have moved towards the exit as the Capitol police feel like they may
[1:43:41.600 --> 1:43:49.360]  not be able to maintain the security or integrity of their police line. Here we see applause taking
[1:43:49.360 --> 1:43:55.360]  place in the Senate we've heard from Jim Jordan we've heard from Steve Scalise now there's this
[1:43:55.360 --> 1:43:59.840]  scumbag which I think something that happened to him so now everybody's sad for him but let's not
[1:43:59.840 --> 1:44:04.480]  forget he's a traitorous scumbag in the end I can't remember his name but frankly I don't care to
[1:44:04.480 --> 1:44:09.680]  here you see in the bottom right hand of the screen the Capitol building staffers moving
[1:44:09.680 --> 1:44:14.400]  towards the exit clearly they don't seem distressed nobody's running they're all moving slowly
[1:44:14.400 --> 1:44:19.840]  looking at their phones or filming with their cameras but still this is an incredible event
[1:44:19.840 --> 1:44:24.720]  and once again it was a small fraction of a fraction of the total crowd that was already at
[1:44:24.720 --> 1:44:31.280]  this Capitol building when the conflict began and now the remainder of that huge almost unprecedented
[1:44:31.280 --> 1:44:39.040]  crowd is moving towards the Capitol as we speak as the debate rages inside. President Trump has
[1:44:39.040 --> 1:44:43.920]  apparently returned it to the White House that's the word that we're receiving from Washington he
[1:44:43.920 --> 1:44:48.000]  said he was going to go to the Capitol but it looks like he's gone to the White House instead
[1:44:48.000 --> 1:44:53.120]  many people on Twitter encouraging him to storm the Senate along with his supporters and what
[1:44:53.120 --> 1:45:00.320]  we're seeing here are the independent journalist videos as Trump supporters move once again
[1:45:00.320 --> 1:45:05.280]  inexorably towards the Capitol building the police seem to be scrambling running back and forth
[1:45:05.280 --> 1:45:11.840]  unsure which way to go and Trump flags waving American Wags Flaving waving Gadsden flags
[1:45:11.840 --> 1:45:23.600]  waving and the joyous you know upbeat atmosphere of the event earlier today has soured and turned
[1:45:23.600 --> 1:45:29.520]  to rage as the fury of Trump supporters and patriots crossing the United States overflows
[1:45:29.520 --> 1:45:38.160]  and expresses itself on the outside of the Capitol it looks like Ted Cruz is now addressing
[1:45:38.160 --> 1:45:44.240]  the House we'd like to get that feed as soon as possible an aerial view provided by Fox shows
[1:45:44.240 --> 1:45:53.440]  the massive and ever-growing crowd Alex Jones continuing to move towards the the Capitol there
[1:45:53.440 --> 1:45:59.600]  one of the only issues that's preventing us from getting more live feeds is the fact that the sheer
[1:45:59.600 --> 1:46:07.040]  number of people overloads the cell phone towers and internet connections become inconsistent at
[1:46:07.040 --> 1:46:14.400]  best but the massive crowd continues to grow a U.S. bomb squad battalion dispatch has arrived on the
[1:46:14.400 --> 1:46:19.120]  scene as well we're not sure if that's because of a reported bomb threat or whether they're just
[1:46:19.120 --> 1:46:24.160]  there as backup as it seems like the U.S. Capitol police are struggling to maintain
[1:46:25.040 --> 1:46:31.920]  their cohesion as more and more people surround the Capitol building and push towards those Senate
[1:46:31.920 --> 1:46:36.480]  and congressional chambers where as we speak objections are being made to the fraudulent
[1:46:36.480 --> 1:46:44.080]  vote that occurred in Arizona two buildings of the U.S. Capitol complex evacuated of course
[1:46:45.360 --> 1:46:50.480]  and once again it looks like the supply of videos has slowed down a bit we'll
[1:46:51.200 --> 1:46:57.440]  keep pulling them in as we can oh here we see Trump supporters are running as they move towards the
[1:46:57.440 --> 1:47:02.000]  Capitol it looks like these stands have already been erected for the supposed inauguration which
[1:47:02.000 --> 1:47:07.200]  should be happening on January 20th that's where you see some of the preparations being made outside
[1:47:07.200 --> 1:47:16.160]  the Capitol and now being torn down by angry Trump supporters this is a video from Drew Hernandez
[1:47:16.160 --> 1:47:22.000]  who is on the scene Elijah Schaefer on the scene Julio Rosas on the scene we see police officers
[1:47:22.000 --> 1:47:26.480]  falling down as they're pushed and being pulled up by their brethren Trump supporters scaling the
[1:47:26.480 --> 1:47:34.480]  scaffolding that's been erected to support the audience there during for the for the inauguration
[1:47:34.480 --> 1:47:41.440]  on January 20th looks like Ted Cruz has objected breaking now from hennedy.com Ted Cruz objects
[1:47:41.440 --> 1:47:47.680]  to Arizona's electoral college results Senate to debate so as we speak the Senate and the Congress
[1:47:47.680 --> 1:47:52.720]  are both in session it's a joint session of Congress they are deciding whether or not to accept
[1:47:52.720 --> 1:48:00.480]  the results that have been put forward to them which means that this is the deciding factor
[1:48:00.480 --> 1:48:06.240]  right now and they go alphabetical order Alaska has been decided 12 electoral votes went to Trump
[1:48:07.120 --> 1:48:11.440]  because of Alaska right now Biden sits at zero because as soon as Arizona came up
[1:48:11.440 --> 1:48:17.360]  the objections came in and now it's the time for argumentation and we may see what happens here of
[1:48:17.360 --> 1:48:24.320]  course Vice President Mike Pence was in a position to outright object and decide on his own based on
[1:48:24.320 --> 1:48:32.480]  some constitutional precedents set over a hundred years ago he has rejected that responsibility
[1:48:32.480 --> 1:48:38.000]  that obligation he said no I can't do that I have to leave it up to the legislature so now we have
[1:48:38.000 --> 1:48:46.320]  legislatures and senators arguing in favor or in opposition to the acceptance of the electoral
[1:48:46.320 --> 1:48:52.160]  slates that have been sent from these various states and once again we're seeing rallies all
[1:48:52.160 --> 1:49:00.240]  across the United States with a rally in Minnesota and elsewhere breaking up breaking off as well
[1:49:00.880 --> 1:49:07.840]  and again these videos coming out from outside the Capitol show a very thin police line heavily
[1:49:07.840 --> 1:49:15.360]  armored with the masks the SWAT helmets the SWAT shields full body armor carrying billy clubs
[1:49:15.360 --> 1:49:20.160]  that look to be about three feet long we're seeing Trump supporters taking hits on the head from those
[1:49:21.360 --> 1:49:28.400]  billy clubs and again this was as of 24 minutes ago and since then we've seen 24 minutes of rising
[1:49:29.520 --> 1:49:33.200]  aggression rising crowds more police building evacuations
[1:49:35.040 --> 1:49:42.320]  and the reaction from across the nation is largely excitement as far as I'm concerned
[1:49:42.320 --> 1:49:47.760]  this is again truly incredible and we'll continue to update and bring you more videos
[1:49:48.560 --> 1:49:53.360]  we're not exactly sure where Owen Schreuer and Alex Jones have arrived at this point they were
[1:49:53.360 --> 1:49:59.280]  about a mile away probably 20 minutes ago so they should be approaching the Capitol now
[1:49:59.280 --> 1:50:05.840]  problem is once again not only have the cell phone towers been overloaded by the sheer mass of
[1:50:05.840 --> 1:50:10.720]  humanity all of their cell phones attempting to get a piece of those networks and they inevitably
[1:50:10.720 --> 1:50:15.360]  go down that's to be expected but what I've noticed is that we haven't received a new video
[1:50:15.360 --> 1:50:21.440]  in about nine minutes and I wonder if there hasn't been some sort of shutdown of the cell network
[1:50:21.440 --> 1:50:26.960]  to prevent information from getting out but we continue to monitor the situation on every different
[1:50:26.960 --> 1:50:31.920]  front uh if you guys want to bring up this Fox news feed we can at least see oh here's a here's
[1:50:31.920 --> 1:50:37.600]  a shot from the back of the Capitol grounds shooting towards the place where the inauguration
[1:50:37.600 --> 1:50:44.320]  is set to commence on January 20th massive massive crowds again moving we see police running we see
[1:50:45.280 --> 1:50:52.080]  Capitol staffers evacuating as the Trump flags wave the American flags wave the Gadsden flags
[1:50:52.080 --> 1:50:58.400]  wave and the Patriots move ever closer we see police being helped away from the scene perhaps
[1:50:58.400 --> 1:51:04.080]  injured perhaps sprayed with mace perhaps friendly fire of mace from his own side getting back in
[1:51:04.080 --> 1:51:09.040]  his own eyes that's we've seen mostly mace being sprayed from the police lines but we've also seen
[1:51:09.040 --> 1:51:13.840]  mace being sprayed right back from the Trump supporters towards the police and this is an
[1:51:13.840 --> 1:51:19.680]  ongoing situation as the crowd continues to swell continues to surround the Capitol and
[1:51:19.680 --> 1:51:27.360]  the police are struggling to maintain it this is this is uh unprecedented ladies and gentlemen this
[1:51:27.360 --> 1:51:36.320]  is perhaps the focal point the changing point the fulcrum upon which the fate of the republic rests
[1:51:36.320 --> 1:51:43.280]  more senators and congressmen objecting police it looks like being escorted off perhaps injured
[1:51:43.280 --> 1:51:49.680]  being assisted by their fellow officers we don't know if they uh have received a blow to the face
[1:51:49.680 --> 1:51:55.520]  or if they've been maced we do know is that the washington establishment is scrambling any and
[1:51:55.520 --> 1:52:02.480]  all officers they have uh at their command in order to deal with this massive outpouring of
[1:52:02.480 --> 1:52:08.800]  anger fury and righteous ind indignation coming from the Trump supporters you can there see
[1:52:08.800 --> 1:52:15.040]  we have the uh fox news feed up and even they are having trouble maintaining the integrity of their
[1:52:15.040 --> 1:52:21.600]  signal and uh we see some of their videos glitching and fading out folks this is the alex joneshow
[1:52:21.600 --> 1:52:25.840]  my name is harrison smith because alex jonesow himself is on the scene and we will do our best
[1:52:25.840 --> 1:52:31.200]  to connect with him and oan shroyer and to see what is going on as patriots scale the scaffolding
[1:52:31.200 --> 1:52:38.080]  the barriers come down and the righteous fury of the american people overwhelms the pathetic
[1:52:38.080 --> 1:52:45.280]  structure of this corrupt system fox has betrayed president trump as i predicted they would they've
[1:52:45.280 --> 1:52:50.080]  always been part of the establishment and it's only going to get worse if they're able to keep
[1:52:50.080 --> 1:52:56.400]  trump from rightfully taking office for second term ontarian 20th the system is going to drop the
[1:52:56.400 --> 1:53:01.360]  hammer harder than ever on this republic they are going to explode gas prices they're going to shut
[1:53:01.360 --> 1:53:06.480]  down our coal power plants they're going to cut off the energy source to us so it's impossible for
[1:53:06.480 --> 1:53:11.280]  factories to go back here this is economic domination this is economic war we are being
[1:53:11.280 --> 1:53:16.480]  consolidated we're being taken over the democrats aren't mismanaging their blue cities and states
[1:53:16.480 --> 1:53:20.960]  they're consolidating power and control to bankrupt the population and bring them
[1:53:20.960 --> 1:53:26.480]  absolutely to heal and then consolidate ownership of all the infrastructure and property this is a
[1:53:26.480 --> 1:53:31.200]  monopolistic takeover that's what the great reset is clout swab and these other criminals
[1:53:31.200 --> 1:53:37.040]  admit it that's what social distancing is so your business is only a 25 for several more years
[1:53:37.040 --> 1:53:40.880]  no small businesses will be there this is a master plan say no
[1:53:40.880 --> 1:53:48.400]  the post industrial world that's what george herbert walker bush signed on to it the
[1:53:49.200 --> 1:53:58.080]  Rio de Janeiro agenda 21 conference back in 1992 now they've launched agenda 2030 which is a post
[1:53:58.080 --> 1:54:03.360]  industrial world plow swab the debauchery to the prime minister of Canada they're all on record saying

[1:54:10.960 --> 1:54:16.880]  the destruction of society as we know it it is making the population poor by designs we can be

[1:55:06.400 --> 1:55:12.080]  are up to the minute videos i mean this is just incredible looks like blood on the ground
[1:55:12.080 --> 1:55:19.280]  uh bare mace being sprayed some sort of other material being sprayed over the over the capital
[1:55:19.280 --> 1:55:26.720]  police going back and forth we have an update about the evacuation uh the the story is that
[1:55:26.720 --> 1:55:32.080]  a pipe bomb was recorded hence the evacuation of the two capital hill buildings although it's been
[1:55:32.080 --> 1:55:37.520]  all cleared now and uh congressional staffers or capital staffers are now reporting that they got
[1:55:37.520 --> 1:55:43.520]  the all clear in order to head back in so perhaps that evacuation was not as a response to the
[1:55:43.520 --> 1:55:50.160]  crowd which continues to hammer at and get in conflict with this thin line of of riot police
[1:55:50.160 --> 1:55:56.240]  fully armored up like medieval knights here in their full body armor their face masks their helmet
[1:55:56.240 --> 1:56:01.200]  and their massive billy club you can see them dragging trump supporters away from the other
[1:56:01.200 --> 1:56:08.240]  patriots as they arrest them arrest are being made uh billy clubs are being used riot shields are in
[1:56:08.240 --> 1:56:13.600]  place and pushing back uh in there you see the commander in the back issuing orders
[1:56:16.000 --> 1:56:24.080]  this is uh this is again completely unprecedented after a year or more of riots and
[1:56:24.080 --> 1:56:32.640]  uh cacophony from the left of uh antifa and black lives matter uh attacking police at every
[1:56:32.640 --> 1:56:40.240]  turn this is the first time that we've seen a similar reaction from the patriots as they
[1:56:40.240 --> 1:56:46.640]  surround and enclose the oh my god that's incredible a massive wooden cross has now
[1:56:46.640 --> 1:56:53.200]  been erected at the foot of the capital steps it's at least 20 feet tall uh truly incredible
[1:56:53.200 --> 1:56:57.680]  and that's that's real wood i mean you can tell from the weight as they uh leverage it up and into
[1:56:57.680 --> 1:57:04.240]  the stand that is not and it's not made out of styrofoam folks that's a heavy wooden cross
[1:57:04.240 --> 1:57:10.320]  being erected as a symbol of defiance to the satanist pedophile pedophile networks that
[1:57:10.320 --> 1:57:16.880]  are attempting at this very moment to overthrow our ability to govern ourselves and it looks like
[1:57:16.880 --> 1:57:22.320]  this is perhaps at the capital building at madison am i wrong in that this is uh wisk wisk
[1:57:22.320 --> 1:57:31.040]  concert where is it uh bethany where oh today is epiphany okay yeah yeah well hey uh symbolic
[1:57:31.040 --> 1:57:36.320]  significance there i believe that so right now we have all over america massive protests breaking
[1:57:36.320 --> 1:57:40.320]  out at capital buildings at states all over the place i believe that was a different one because
[1:57:40.320 --> 1:57:48.480]  i saw snow on the ground there which i believe is uh must have come from that's in front of the
[1:57:48.480 --> 1:57:54.320]  capital but that's not it's not the us capital that's not the american capital uh the the dc
[1:57:54.320 --> 1:58:01.840]  capital i think that is uh probably madison but we'll we'll figure that out uh los angeles as
[1:58:01.840 --> 1:58:08.880]  well as stop the steel rally lining the streets hundreds of trump supporters uh people cheering
[1:58:08.880 --> 1:58:14.480]  it on on twitter saying saying drag them out saying go into the capital building and drag the traders
[1:58:14.480 --> 1:58:21.440]  out as things continue to escalate here from julio rossus capitals uh capital please push the
[1:58:21.440 --> 1:58:27.040]  trump supporters back and use a lot of pepper spray as more videos are being posted by ham and
[1:58:27.040 --> 1:58:31.600]  other independent uh reporters now meanwhile if you're going to be watching something like
[1:58:31.600 --> 1:58:35.680]  fox news or cnn all you're going to see is one of two things where they're going to see
[1:58:35.680 --> 1:58:42.160]  a very uh wide shot of crowds somewhere in washington dc it looks like they've got a
[1:58:42.160 --> 1:58:47.760]  shot on freedom plaza as people slowly meander towards uh the capital city or you're going to
[1:58:47.760 --> 1:58:52.640]  see inside the senate chambers where the argumentation is now taking place on whether or not to accept
[1:58:52.640 --> 1:58:58.640]  the arizona electoral slate giving them to joe biden the objection has been made and in both the
[1:58:58.640 --> 1:59:04.560]  senate and the congress arguments are being made back and forth uh we heard that uh congresswoman
[1:59:04.560 --> 1:59:08.320]  uh bobert was interrupted and we're trying to figure out what that was about it looked like
[1:59:08.320 --> 1:59:13.440]  some contention there she was speaking and objecting and then she uh was forced to stop and sat
[1:59:13.440 --> 1:59:17.040]  down and was speaking up and we'll try to figure out what was going on there where the rules were
[1:59:17.040 --> 1:59:21.840]  violated whether she was prevented from presenting her case uh but we'll continue to bring all of
[1:59:21.840 --> 1:59:28.000]  this to you up to the minute and we'll get a live feed from the info wars crews there on the ground

[2:02:14.160 --> 2:02:22.240]  have been uh torn down and the people have moved on to that raised platform and are scaling the
[2:02:22.240 --> 2:02:29.360]  scaffolding that was set up previously for the inauguration that is to take place on january
[2:02:29.360 --> 2:02:33.840]  20th here we see the flash bangs and the gas grenades being launched over the heads of the

[2:03:09.200 --> 2:03:14.640]  which this massive wooden cross has been raised by christian patriots who are sick and tired of
[2:03:14.640 --> 2:03:22.720]  their heritage their religion their belief system being denigrated and uh desecrated by the satanic
[2:03:22.720 --> 2:03:32.080]  forces that have occupied our great country so in a symbol of defiance to the worldly secular
[2:03:32.080 --> 2:03:37.600]  ruling class a massive wooden cross has been erected in front of the capital building in the
[2:03:37.600 --> 2:03:46.960]  state of michigan as a protest erupt throughout the country as uh vice president mike pence has
[2:03:46.960 --> 2:03:54.320]  refused or rejected his responsibility or obligation to reject or determine exactly which
[2:03:54.960 --> 2:04:01.040]  electoral votes to consider now the debate continues to rage and it looks like yes they
[2:04:01.040 --> 2:04:05.120]  have gotten onto the balconies they've gone up the stairs the barricades have fallen the police
[2:04:05.120 --> 2:04:10.640]  have retreated although we continue to see clashes and perhaps they're just regrouping
[2:04:10.640 --> 2:04:18.240]  but this energy has to be maintained and here we see a view from earlier today during president
[2:04:18.240 --> 2:04:25.280]  trump's speech of just the innumerable trump supporters waving flags and they're in support
[2:04:25.280 --> 2:04:31.280]  of the president's and in defiance of what we're told was a completely fair election the most secure
[2:04:31.280 --> 2:04:36.240]  election of all time uh those lies no longer hold weight they no longer carry water with the vast
[2:04:36.240 --> 2:04:43.440]  majority of uh americans in this country let's go again do we have that feed from alex jones and
[2:04:43.440 --> 2:04:47.760]  and oan shroyer as they're they're live on the ground we'll bring you that uh just as soon as
[2:04:47.760 --> 2:04:51.200]  he gets back up here it is i don't know if we want to go to it quite yet though as i
[2:04:51.200 --> 2:05:04.080]  i think folks we are more aware of what's happened than they are right now they may be on the ground
[2:05:04.080 --> 2:05:07.840]  and we'll be getting their perspective just as soon as possible and they'll have information that we
[2:05:07.840 --> 2:05:14.080]  don't have but as of right now we have the luxury of having eyes in many places we're receiving videos
[2:05:14.080 --> 2:05:21.840]  updates and rumors and all sorts of stuff from various different corners all being uh aggregated
[2:05:21.840 --> 2:05:26.240]  here and then presented to you whereas if you're on the ground all you know is what you see for
[2:05:26.240 --> 2:05:31.680]  yourself uh since with the overloaded cell systems you're not going to be able to check twitter if
[2:05:31.680 --> 2:05:36.800]  you're there so we're actually probably more aware of what's going on as a whole surrounding the
[2:05:36.800 --> 2:05:41.200]  entire capital than alex jones and oan shroyer are themselves despite the fact that they're there
[2:05:41.200 --> 2:05:48.720]  uh on the ground and we can just hear the rolling chance of usa fight for trump
[2:05:51.440 --> 2:05:58.800]  incredible this crowd continues to swell uh what was it i mean i've lost track of time
[2:05:58.800 --> 2:06:05.680]  i think it was less than an hour ago uh an hour ago that president trump finished his speech in
[2:06:05.680 --> 2:06:10.240]  that massive crowd of hundreds of thousands probably upwards of a million people surrounding
[2:06:10.240 --> 2:06:15.840]  the washington monument and all the way to the white house uh finished watching that speech by
[2:06:15.840 --> 2:06:22.720]  president trump and moved towards the u.s capital and by the time that uh here we see an update from
[2:06:22.720 --> 2:06:27.120]  ilhan omar currently the capital buildings are locked down and everyone is sheltering in place
[2:06:27.120 --> 2:06:32.560]  hey so look that's where ilhan omar is everyone he's getting uh massive crowds yeah you can see
[2:06:32.560 --> 2:06:38.960]  those in the distance as they move towards capital and once again inside the capital building right
[2:06:38.960 --> 2:06:44.640]  now our uh a debate is raging as to whether or not to accept this fraudulent election
[2:06:46.080 --> 2:06:50.960]  on live tv newsmax reporter ordered to the capital basement due to a bomb threat near the rotunda
[2:06:50.960 --> 2:06:58.400]  again we think that was a not a legitimate threat as it was called all clear and the evacuation
[2:06:58.400 --> 2:07:04.320]  orders were rescinded trump supporters have been ordered to disperse but it doesn't look like they're
[2:07:04.320 --> 2:07:12.320]  going anywhere and we're seeing more and more uh destruction taking place rioters riders have
[2:07:12.320 --> 2:07:16.240]  entered a capital city police officer in front of the capital building you saw that video earlier
[2:07:16.240 --> 2:07:22.720]  of the police being helped away from the crowd uh by his compatriots we think that to me it looks
[2:07:22.720 --> 2:07:26.400]  like something got in his eyes it looks like perhaps he got pepper sprayed may have been friendly
[2:07:26.400 --> 2:07:31.040]  fire or it may have been owned here we have carolin breman viewed from inside the capital
[2:07:31.040 --> 2:07:37.760]  if people gather on the west front the capital is currently on lockdown massive crowds totally
[2:07:37.760 --> 2:07:45.840]  surrounding the capital angry trump supporters aware of the fraud cognizant of the betrayal
[2:07:45.840 --> 2:07:50.800]  that is being carried out of this very moment inside the capital building they continue to
[2:07:50.800 --> 2:08:00.400]  push forward reorganize regain footing and move ever forward once again folks the
[2:08:00.400 --> 2:08:06.880]  communication networks are completely overloaded with the sheer mass of people so getting any
[2:08:06.880 --> 2:08:12.240]  firsthand information about this is going to be difficult but we'll continue to bring
[2:08:12.240 --> 2:08:19.200]  uh as up to the minute updates as we possibly can protesters have breached police lines and are now
[2:08:19.200 --> 2:08:31.040]  on the steps of the us capital again the rolling cheers of usa usa us capital on lockdown now
[2:08:31.040 --> 2:08:38.960]  during the electoral vote count and as far as we know the vote count has stalled out at 12 for
[2:08:38.960 --> 2:08:45.600]  president trump and zero for president so-called president elect biden as they only got through
[2:08:45.600 --> 2:08:51.360]  alaska before arizona was up the objections came in and the debate began we don't know if this
[2:08:51.360 --> 2:08:59.200]  debate will be uh continued and carried on as lockdown continues or whether they may pause
[2:08:59.200 --> 2:09:08.000]  and try to reassess what exactly is going on and how to deal with it of course the congressman
[2:09:08.000 --> 2:09:12.960]  and women and senators i don't think are at much of a threat we know there's one thing they take
[2:09:12.960 --> 2:09:18.320]  very very seriously it is their own personal well-being and their own uh security there are tunnels
[2:09:18.320 --> 2:09:25.440]  of course uh crisscrossing like spider webs throughout all of dc and uh there's almost no
[2:09:25.440 --> 2:09:30.240]  risk of them having to try to escape through a crowd or having to bunker down in the capital
[2:09:30.240 --> 2:09:36.480]  building they have escape routes uh more than they need so again i do not think there's actually a
[2:09:36.480 --> 2:09:40.800]  bodily threat to anybody in the chambers at this moment they don't seem too concerned they're
[2:09:40.800 --> 2:09:47.760]  continuing to argue continuing to debate without so much as a look over their shoulder as to the
[2:09:47.760 --> 2:09:53.920]  doors being broke down or anything like that this is simply a massive protest that is refusing to
[2:09:53.920 --> 2:10:00.400]  stay quiet any longer that is making themselves known that is uh not stopping at the barricades not
[2:10:01.280 --> 2:10:05.840]  toutowing and adhering to the police who have betrayed us time and time again but instead
[2:10:05.840 --> 2:10:12.880]  are pushing forward to take over what is at the heart of it our building it's our as americans
[2:10:12.880 --> 2:10:18.880]  this building belongs to us this capital belongs to us and it is being stolen from us at this very
[2:10:18.880 --> 2:10:25.040]  minute live and the american people are attempting to prevent that from taking place once again i
[2:10:25.040 --> 2:10:30.240]  don't believe uh that people inside the capital building are concerned about this whatsoever at
[2:10:30.240 --> 2:10:34.320]  least in terms of their safety or anything like that uh if anything were to happen if the doors
[2:10:34.320 --> 2:10:38.880]  were to be to breach they would be evacuated rapidly they'd disappear into underground tunnels and be
[2:10:38.880 --> 2:10:44.880]  moved to a safe house far out of harm's way so we're too concerned for them and will continue to
[2:10:44.880 --> 2:10:51.120]  keep you updated and bring you videos just as soon as we get them hey everybody confused about

[2:15:45.600 --> 2:15:51.600]  bangs being fired over the front lines into the crowd of uh trump supporters but it seems like
[2:15:51.600 --> 2:15:58.240]  those attempts to prevent the onrush of patriots has failed these security barriers have fallen
[2:15:58.240 --> 2:16:04.400]  one by one and the capital is now being occupied and according to elijah schaefer destroyed by
[2:16:04.400 --> 2:16:09.440]  patriots we're seeing live feeds from fox news as the crowds continue to swell continue to grow
[2:16:09.440 --> 2:16:15.280]  the american flags continue to wave as the patriots move towards the united states capital building
[2:16:15.280 --> 2:16:20.720]  and continue to occupy it here we're seeing a live view from inside the capital building
[2:16:20.720 --> 2:16:27.840]  perhaps from a staffer as they look at the thin line the thin barrier of wood and glass separating
[2:16:27.840 --> 2:16:35.040]  them from hordes of angry americans us capital on total lockdown certification vote has been paused
[2:16:35.040 --> 2:16:40.960]  as protests continue to erupt the senate has adjourned abruptly mike vice president mike
[2:16:40.960 --> 2:16:45.520]  pence has been rushed off the senate senate floor trump supporters have breached the us
[2:16:45.520 --> 2:16:50.960]  capital building we're seeing images within the halls of congress and within the halls of the
[2:16:50.960 --> 2:16:57.120]  capital of trump supporters who have breached those doors two capital hill buildings have been
[2:16:57.120 --> 2:17:02.480]  evacuated by the uscp and we're also hearing that the private residences on capital hill
[2:17:02.480 --> 2:17:08.720]  are being evacuated as well senators the vice president the congressmen now no doubt making
[2:17:08.720 --> 2:17:14.080]  their way towards the security of the underground tunnels to escort them away from the threat of
[2:17:14.080 --> 2:17:20.640]  their supposed constituents angry furious and now venting that frustration on the system that has
[2:17:20.640 --> 2:17:25.440]  betrayed them time and time again this is just incredible folks are watching info wars sissy
[2:17:25.440 --> 2:17:30.720]  alex jones show alex jones is right now at the scene they're sort of on the edge we're receiving
[2:17:30.720 --> 2:17:36.240]  intermittent uh streams from them as the cell phone networks are overloaded and that and
[2:17:36.240 --> 2:17:41.680]  information becomes harder to come by what we know is that alex jones and oan shroyer are not at the
[2:17:41.680 --> 2:17:46.880]  head of this they are not the ones breaking into the capital but they they are there on the periphery
[2:17:46.880 --> 2:17:53.920]  watching this uh receiving this information in real time truly incredible dc is now in control
[2:17:53.920 --> 2:18:01.120]  of the patriots as an officer of the united states capital police radios the phrase we have lost
[2:18:01.120 --> 2:18:07.040]  control i repeat we have lost control protesters now inside the capital building those marble
[2:18:07.040 --> 2:18:11.920]  staircases being trod upon by patriots who are raising their hands showing they're peaceful
[2:18:11.920 --> 2:18:17.200]  yet they aren't going anywhere as one after another the security barriers have fallen
[2:18:18.320 --> 2:18:24.800]  vp mike pince evacuated from the capital building trump loyalists storm u.s capital tear gas deployed
[2:18:24.800 --> 2:18:29.600]  few arrests made the police have lost control barricades torn down buildings evacuated the
[2:18:29.600 --> 2:18:36.240]  press has been moved to the basement as they scramble to avoid the on press of millions uh at
[2:18:36.240 --> 2:18:42.400]  least i would say my estimation a million trump supporters having moved from throughout dc and
[2:18:42.400 --> 2:18:48.800]  are now converging on the capital this is revolution in progress this is a major historic moment in the
[2:18:48.800 --> 2:18:53.680]  history of the united states and is a privilege and an honor to be here sharing it with you
[2:18:53.680 --> 2:18:58.480]  and bringing you updates just as soon as possible we're getting information that you will not get
[2:18:58.480 --> 2:19:07.040]  anywhere else we are receiving videos and updates in a faster method than any other network mainstream
[2:19:07.040 --> 2:19:14.880]  or otherwise here we see okay now we have a a battalion of neon shirted police the the backup
[2:19:14.880 --> 2:19:20.880]  has been called they're moving slowly but surely towards the capital but it may be already too
[2:19:20.880 --> 2:19:27.200]  late the doors have been breached the patriots are inside the senate has ceased debating because
[2:19:27.200 --> 2:19:32.960]  of the vote has been uh paused the vote on certification has been paused and the entire
[2:19:32.960 --> 2:19:38.960]  building is being evacuated folks we've seen it for four years we've seen the anger of the left
[2:19:38.960 --> 2:19:45.520]  we saw it under cavanaugh as uh the the protesters who fell for the lie time after time again
[2:19:45.520 --> 2:19:53.120]  screech and claw impotently at the door we've seen six months or more of violent protest burning down
[2:19:53.120 --> 2:19:59.600]  entire cities aimless pointless destruction being wrought across the united states by liberal and
[2:19:59.600 --> 2:20:05.680]  communist agitators all to the point of trying to tear down our system now we see not the system
[2:20:05.680 --> 2:20:12.400]  fight back but those who love america fight back patriots now taking over the entire capital
[2:20:12.400 --> 2:20:19.040]  steps continuing to wave the american flag the gadson flag the tree of liberty flag the trump
[2:20:19.040 --> 2:20:24.880]  flag they've taken it over it is done this is what happens when americans rise up this is
[2:20:24.880 --> 2:20:32.960]  what happens when patriots do what the communists have been trying to do for so long uh again this
[2:20:32.960 --> 2:20:39.440]  is not an impotent pointless nonsense protest based off misinformation like the death of
[2:20:39.440 --> 2:20:45.360]  george floyd who killed himself with fentanyl or jacob blake who just yesterday was proven he was
[2:20:45.360 --> 2:20:51.600]  armed and dangerous when police rightfully took him down or the the lies of brett cavanaugh for
[2:20:51.600 --> 2:20:58.160]  four years we've seen the outrageous and yet impotent lashing out of lefdes throughout america
[2:20:58.160 --> 2:21:05.680]  and for the first time it seems after having shown patience of the that of angels the americans the
[2:21:05.680 --> 2:21:09.520]  trump supporters who've seen their lives destroyed they've seen their businesses shut down they've
[2:21:09.520 --> 2:21:15.280]  seen the lockdown perpetuated all across america destroying our economy surrendering to
[2:21:15.280 --> 2:21:23.680]  china over and over again stories that expose the corruption and the underselling of america
[2:21:23.680 --> 2:21:30.640]  to to communist china the other foreign powers have gone ignored have been suppressed have been
[2:21:30.640 --> 2:21:35.600]  shut down time and time again the american people have shrugged and taken the blows
[2:21:35.600 --> 2:21:42.160]  on the back without so much as a whimper in protest but finally they have pushed too far
[2:21:42.160 --> 2:21:46.080]  after stealing our last resort we always knew in the back of our minds in the back of our heads
[2:21:46.080 --> 2:21:51.040]  we had the numbers we had the will we could through the electoral process maintain some
[2:21:51.040 --> 2:21:57.440]  semblance of control over what is supposed to be our representative democracy our republic
[2:21:58.160 --> 2:22:03.680]  well they stole that from us they took away the final lifeline they destroyed the final pressure
[2:22:03.680 --> 2:22:09.360]  valve and now the rage of the american people overflows as patriots storm into the united

[2:22:50.720 --> 2:22:54.880]  donald trump one minute ago mike pence didn't have the courage to do what should have been

[2:27:07.600 --> 2:27:13.920]  the history is being made as we speak this just in as of less than a minute ago the
[2:27:13.920 --> 2:27:18.560]  intended door has now been reached capital police say trump protesters surge into the
[2:27:18.560 --> 2:27:24.000]  building that's going to disclose tv who shows an overhead shot of this massive crowd moving
[2:27:24.000 --> 2:27:29.920]  towards the capital we're seeing uh shots from inside now the trump protesters here's shots from
[2:27:29.920 --> 2:27:35.440]  inside now you can see the glass there in the wood door that i believe this is the eastern door
[2:27:35.440 --> 2:27:39.920]  of the capital and you can see the protesters asking the people inside hey push the door open
[2:27:39.920 --> 2:27:43.760]  push the door open and not even attempting to break the glass not attempting to cause
[2:27:44.480 --> 2:27:50.240]  trouble or to to cause damage but rather trying to get the people inside to act as patriots
[2:27:50.240 --> 2:27:55.760]  themselves open the door and put it into this farce of an election that we've been witness to
[2:27:55.760 --> 2:28:02.960]  this entire time truly incredible stuff uh darin j bd on twitter says the fbi should take a
[2:28:02.960 --> 2:28:08.720]  knee to show respect to the maga protesters and maybe if uh maybe if black lives matter was there
[2:28:08.720 --> 2:28:14.160]  the police would be on our side instead the police have fallen back the senate chambers have been
[2:28:14.160 --> 2:28:19.360]  evacuated the vote counting the certification of the electors has been suspended for the time being
[2:28:19.360 --> 2:28:22.960]  as they deal with the fact that protesters are now within the capital here we're seeing
[2:28:23.680 --> 2:28:30.480]  physical combat taking place inside the capital between the pillars mace being sprayed punches
[2:28:30.480 --> 2:28:35.840]  being thrown protesters going head to head with the capital city police who have fallen back to
[2:28:35.840 --> 2:28:41.280]  inside the building and are pretending and are attempting to prevent the onslaught the onrush
[2:28:41.280 --> 2:28:50.000]  of these trump protesters now before the debate was uh ceased mcconnell had said the election was
[2:28:50.000 --> 2:28:55.120]  not stolen as trump says mcconnell claims there was no massive collection of fraud mcconnell says
[2:28:55.120 --> 2:29:03.120]  congress can't make itself a board of elections uh amazing isn't it absolutely amazing the
[2:29:03.120 --> 2:29:10.720]  utter failure of the republicans to uh wield any sort of institutional power in at the behest of
[2:29:10.720 --> 2:29:18.720]  or to the benefit of their own people the election fraud as enumerated earlier today by donald trump
[2:29:18.720 --> 2:29:25.120]  is in the millions the provable provable ones is at least the hundreds of thousands he pointed out
[2:29:25.120 --> 2:29:31.760]  the hundreds of thousands of people in detroit in georgia in michigan and minnesota and elsewhere
[2:29:31.760 --> 2:29:38.160]  of non-registered voters of uh registered voters who you know more votes than registered voters in
[2:29:38.160 --> 2:29:44.800]  detroit you had 139 percent votes i mean this doesn't make any sense this is incredible this
[2:29:44.800 --> 2:29:51.200]  is nonsense and yet it goes unopposed by the republicans with the power to do anything about
[2:29:51.200 --> 2:29:58.960]  it they instead abrogate that power and refuse to exert their constitutional authority instead
[2:29:59.520 --> 2:30:04.160]  wanting to do anything they can to simply get rid of president trump so they can get back to the
[2:30:04.160 --> 2:30:10.080]  status quo back to business as usual which is of course the continual selling out of the american
[2:30:10.080 --> 2:30:16.720]  people the continual undermining of our heritage and our nation and the continual surrendering
[2:30:16.720 --> 2:30:22.320]  of everything we hold dear to those who would destroy us and make no bones about it this is
[2:30:22.320 --> 2:30:28.400]  from their own mouths we're seeing now on fox news and elsewhere just the sheer crowds
[2:30:30.080 --> 2:30:36.480]  all over the the capital steps waving stop the steel signs waving american flags for the
[2:30:36.480 --> 2:30:42.240]  for the time being at least the steel has been stopped we have uh uh no we're no longer counting
[2:30:42.240 --> 2:30:48.240]  the no longer counting the votes no longer uh debating the certification it has all
[2:30:48.880 --> 2:30:57.040]  ground to a halt it has all ceased to continue as the lawmakers and the other capitol hill staffers
[2:30:57.920 --> 2:31:02.880]  flee in fear of their safety two buildings of the us capital complex were evacuated
[2:31:02.880 --> 2:31:10.080]  uh flash bangs have been launched into the the uh trump protester lines the barricades are being
[2:31:10.080 --> 2:31:15.920]  torn down this is just another peaceful protest folks uh these trump supporters are just ideas
[2:31:15.920 --> 2:31:21.840]  after all i say that uh in jest obviously but uh you know if you really think about it so far
[2:31:21.840 --> 2:31:27.120]  nothing's been burnt down no innocent people have been uh knocked out and then kicked in the head
[2:31:27.120 --> 2:31:31.680]  while they lay on the on the pavement uh this is not scratched the surface of the type of violence
[2:31:31.680 --> 2:31:38.080]  chaos and destruction that we've seen rot across this entire nation for an entire year without
[2:31:38.080 --> 2:31:44.480]  the slightest hint of protest from the democrats in fact they support them they join them right now
[2:31:44.480 --> 2:31:50.320]  what we're seeing is not uh george soros funded this is not people trained by the communist
[2:31:50.320 --> 2:31:56.880]  chinese like black lives matter leaders admit to being this is a natural spontaneous event
[2:31:56.880 --> 2:32:02.160]  being carried out by trump supporters from all over the nation we also have incredible images
[2:32:02.160 --> 2:32:07.680]  of the michigan state house outside of which a massive wooden cross has been erected as a
[2:32:07.680 --> 2:32:14.400]  symbol of defiance to the satanic pedophile network that has slowly but surely captured
[2:32:14.400 --> 2:32:20.080]  each and every institution that governs this once great nation truly incredible stuff do we still
[2:32:20.080 --> 2:32:27.360]  have that feed from alex jones alex jones alex jones and i'm sure are live on the scene we're
[2:32:27.360 --> 2:32:33.200]  having trouble uh getting connected to them because of the overwhelming number of people has
[2:32:34.160 --> 2:32:40.240]  as i said overwhelmed the cellular networks absolutely massive scenes inside the capital
[2:32:40.240 --> 2:32:47.280]  building of protesters making their way up and down the marble staircases as of four minutes ago
[2:32:47.280 --> 2:32:53.920]  we see somebody videoing down the down the staircases out the windows as they see these
[2:32:53.920 --> 2:33:01.280]  patriots move towards them they then turn and run to safety as we said before although things have
[2:33:01.280 --> 2:33:06.320]  escalated since then i don't believe that any of our representatives are actually themselves at
[2:33:06.320 --> 2:33:13.920]  risk of physical injury there's enough planning and uh you know things in place so preparations
[2:33:13.920 --> 2:33:19.760]  have been made to where those people can very rapidly evacuate and get out into the tunnels
[2:33:19.760 --> 2:33:27.280]  beneath the streets of washington dc where they can be secreted away ferried away to safety i don't
[2:33:27.280 --> 2:33:32.960]  have too much fear for this becoming bloody or violent unless of course the police start to
[2:33:34.560 --> 2:33:39.040]  clash back and and push back here we're seeing i mean just incredible images folks this is a day
[2:33:39.040 --> 2:33:44.960]  that will go down in history we're seeing uh protesters they're scaling the very walls of
[2:33:44.960 --> 2:33:54.640]  the capital scaling the scaffolding that uh once was uh erected to uh for the inauguration on january
[2:33:54.640 --> 2:34:02.000]  20th and yes we're seeing images here that will go down in history this is a major moment in america
[2:34:02.000 --> 2:34:06.320]  whether it will come to anything or not i guess we'll have to just wait and see and we'll continue
[2:34:06.320 --> 2:34:13.120]  to bring you updates as we get them again two of the capital buildings were evacuated earlier because
[2:34:13.120 --> 2:34:20.320]  of apparently the threat of a pipe bomb that uh has been withdrawn those buildings no longer have
[2:34:20.320 --> 2:34:27.040]  that stand down order issued or that evacuation order rather issued but it seems like the residential
[2:34:27.040 --> 2:34:33.040]  buildings around capital hill are being evacuated and the senate and congress themselves have been
[2:34:33.040 --> 2:34:40.160]  evacuated and are no longer taking part in the debate for the certification of votes here we see
[2:34:40.160 --> 2:34:45.760]  a protester holding a riot shield that he probably got from a police officer windows being broken
[2:34:45.760 --> 2:34:54.320]  and tentatively here we go the patriots moving in towards moving into the capital building this
[2:34:54.320 --> 2:35:03.760]  is incredible folks there you go using the riot shield to bash through the windows of the capital
[2:35:03.760 --> 2:35:12.560]  using large pieces of wood that were no doubt there uh for the for the scaffolding and yeah
[2:35:12.560 --> 2:35:16.640]  we're seeing patriots move in they've surrounded the capital building they've broken through the
[2:35:16.640 --> 2:35:24.960]  barriers they're now breaking the windows and making their way into the capital building uh from the
[2:35:24.960 --> 2:35:32.160]  dc police from the uh now now that my god now the protesters have gotten their hands on fire
[2:35:32.160 --> 2:35:38.080]  extinguishers and are spraying them at the people the congressional staffers and media members of
[2:35:38.080 --> 2:35:43.200]  the media who are attempting to film them they're getting a face full of fire extinguisher gas
[2:35:43.200 --> 2:35:48.800]  uh as police continue to radio and we heard over the radio from the us capital police
[2:35:48.800 --> 2:35:56.240]  we have lost control repeat we have lost control control now ceded to the patriots who have breached
[2:35:56.240 --> 2:36:03.360]  the capital and are moving ever more you know ever farther into this capital building people
[2:36:03.360 --> 2:36:08.640]  dressed as pioneers people carrying riot shields that have been stripped from the capital city
[2:36:08.640 --> 2:36:18.320]  police uh mega hats confederate flags american flags gads and flags again mostly people mostly
[2:36:18.320 --> 2:36:24.800]  peaceful i have to say i haven't seen any attacks i haven't seen any uh vicious uh lashing out at
[2:36:24.800 --> 2:36:29.840]  innocent people i've seen nothing but tearing down of barriers the breaking of windows and the
[2:36:29.840 --> 2:36:36.640]  moving ever forward inexorably towards the heart of the republic the capital building which has
[2:36:36.640 --> 2:36:42.000]  long been under the occupation of globalist forces this is truly incredible stuff folks and we'll bring
[2:36:42.000 --> 2:36:50.960]  you up to date uh updates as we get into stay with us mountain patriot in colorado thank you for
[2:36:50.960 --> 2:36:55.920]  holding how you doing alex man i'm just working as hard as i can we're in such a critical time
[2:36:55.920 --> 2:37:02.000]  brother how are you i love you man i want to uh make a quick plug that dna force i love it i've
[2:37:02.000 --> 2:37:06.960]  been using it quite a while and i just went looked at the ingredients again the other day and i see
[2:37:06.960 --> 2:37:14.080]  that it contains quercetin which according to some published studies that dr mercola has cited
[2:37:14.800 --> 2:37:21.840]  is an ionophore similar to hydroxychloroquine and it helps channel the zinc into the cells so
[2:37:21.840 --> 2:37:27.920]  people might want to take a look at that all i know is with dna force we went out and looked at
[2:37:27.920 --> 2:37:32.720]  these high-end products that they sell through doctor clinics that aren't prescription but the
[2:37:32.720 --> 2:37:36.240]  doctor sells like 300 bucks a bottle because there's a lot of expensive product and it's
[2:37:36.240 --> 2:37:41.440]  really only cost them like 50 bucks and so we basically cloned two different top brands together
[2:37:41.440 --> 2:37:44.080]  and that's what produced this so thanks thanks for the plug
[2:37:48.640 --> 2:37:52.960]  the pope came out yesterday and announced a global government corporate alliance to
[2:37:52.960 --> 2:37:57.840]  redistribute wealth and create a planetary universal income which of course the united
[2:37:57.840 --> 2:38:01.920]  nations and global corporations will control through the apps on your phone and finally a chip
[2:38:01.920 --> 2:38:08.800]  under your skin it's all now completely official part of the un great reset of the debauchery and
[2:38:08.800 --> 2:38:13.600]  claus schwaub all officially written about in hundreds of books by schwaub and rock n feller
[2:38:13.600 --> 2:38:19.280]  foundation all the rest of them at 10 to 21 20 30 it's here and only gets worse like being fed
[2:38:19.280 --> 2:38:26.320]  into a wood chipper or a meat grinder until you reject it all and the rejection starts with
[2:38:26.320 --> 2:38:31.920]  realizing it's spiritual battle diverse evil and stopping abortion we must start valuing
[2:38:31.920 --> 2:38:37.920]  human life again we must start saying that we are not expendable that we are not disposable
[2:38:37.920 --> 2:38:45.120]  that we are essential until we do that we are all slaves we must stand up and declare our basic
[2:38:45.120 --> 2:38:53.760]  god given human rights now three two one here we go it's back in stock it's been sold out for
[2:38:53.760 --> 2:38:57.840]  over eight months we couldn't get it because the lockdown pollen block is back in stock let me tell
[2:38:57.840 --> 2:39:01.840]  you we'll talk about it but the power of quail egg concentrate pollen block acts differently

[2:41:50.160 --> 2:41:54.800]  supporters of president trump breached the us capital according to uh capital police officers
[2:41:54.800 --> 2:41:59.760]  yes that is happening cnn believe it or not uh we don't need to hear from the capital police when
[2:41:59.760 --> 2:42:04.000]  we see it with our own eyes trump supporters chase away the outnumbered capital police and
[2:42:04.000 --> 2:42:10.160]  throw objects at them uh we're seeing they're inside the capital and outside uh patriots
[2:42:10.160 --> 2:42:16.320]  swarming throughout we're gonna try to find uh try to find more information about this shooting
[2:42:16.320 --> 2:42:22.720]  that has been reported we don't know whether this is uh bullets being fired or whether this is
[2:42:22.720 --> 2:42:28.320]  tear gas canisters perhaps being fired ted cruz says violence is always unacceptable even when
[2:42:28.320 --> 2:42:34.080]  passions run highs uh run high here we do here we are iddo kief reports that a congressional aid
[2:42:34.080 --> 2:42:39.600]  says members were told to get under the chairs in the house chamber here we see my god we see uh
[2:42:39.600 --> 2:42:45.280]  members inside the senate chambers piling up furniture to block the doors as protesters
[2:42:45.280 --> 2:42:52.400]  move ever towards the center of our republic this is absolutely mind blowing they say they're
[2:42:52.400 --> 2:42:58.000]  shooting into the chamber so perhaps uh and that goes along with the the image that you're seeing
[2:42:58.000 --> 2:43:05.680]  here so perhaps they are uh the members of piled furniture to block the doors trump supporters
[2:43:05.680 --> 2:43:11.520]  outnumbering the capital police and driving them away throwing uh objects at them uh trump supporters
[2:43:11.520 --> 2:43:18.400]  scaling the walls of the capital breaking into the capital uh they've secured uh fire extinguishers
[2:43:18.400 --> 2:43:26.400]  and are uh blowing them in the face of the the capital hill uh staff there that's tempting to
[2:43:26.400 --> 2:43:34.720]  video or film what's going on this is incredible folks to okay yeah we already saw that i want to
[2:43:34.720 --> 2:43:41.680]  hear more about this uh the supposed shooting from disclose tv protesters are smashing the doors
[2:43:41.680 --> 2:43:45.920]  to the u.s. house chamber that's the image that we saw just a second ago of the furniture being
[2:43:45.920 --> 2:43:52.320]  piled up in a attempt to prevent or at least waylay or delay the breaking into the house chamber
[2:43:52.320 --> 2:43:57.680]  there uh u.s. senate chamber has been evacuated and senators are being taken to a secure location
[2:43:57.680 --> 2:44:03.120]  house members are being instructed to put on masks as tear gas is now inside the u.s. capital
[2:44:03.120 --> 2:44:11.840]  dome folks this is again unprecedented this is history being made as we speak uh via m e p
[2:44:11.840 --> 2:44:17.520]  fuller shots fired into the u.s. house chamber we don't know if that is an armed protester
[2:44:17.520 --> 2:44:23.280]  or if those are uh officers firing or if that's tear gas all we've heard is that shots are being
[2:44:23.280 --> 2:44:29.040]  fired into the u.s. house chamber as protesters are smashing the door to that house chamber and
[2:44:29.040 --> 2:44:36.800]  the representatives are piling furniture up to block that door uh again Elijah Schaefer
[2:44:36.800 --> 2:44:43.920]  inside Nancy Pelosi's office and they didn't even have time to sign out of their computers
[2:44:43.920 --> 2:44:51.440]  leaving the no doubt should be secured programs wide open for anybody and everybody to see okay
[2:44:51.440 --> 2:44:56.640]  it looks like those are police on either side of the door with guns so as the protesters are
[2:44:56.640 --> 2:45:00.720]  attempting to break down the door shots are being fired we don't know if that's uh if they're
[2:45:00.720 --> 2:45:08.400]  being fired into the cap into the uh uh chamber there but we definitely see at least three guns
[2:45:08.400 --> 2:45:15.200]  being leveled from inside the chamber to the door you know at the door firing at the protesters
[2:45:15.200 --> 2:45:22.800]  outside of that door folks this is this is history being made as we speak where this goes from here
[2:45:22.800 --> 2:45:29.600]  it is anybody's guess but it doesn't look like it will be calming down or uh ending anytime soon
[2:45:30.320 --> 2:45:36.080]  we're receiving updates from a variety of sources here as we continue to
[2:45:38.320 --> 2:45:45.920]  to monitor what is going on my god folks let's keep rolling some of these uh some of these videos
[2:45:45.920 --> 2:45:50.320]  Trump supporters again chasing away the Capitol Police the Capitol Police saying we've lost control
[2:45:50.320 --> 2:45:56.960]  uh hordes of Trump supporters now uh posted up on the front steps of the Capitol and you
[2:45:56.960 --> 2:46:03.120]  can see outside the Capitol hundreds of thousands of more Trump supporters moving ever towards this
[2:46:03.120 --> 2:46:08.320]  building this symbol of our once great country that has been occupied by globalist forces
[2:46:08.320 --> 2:46:13.040]  for at least as long as I have been alive and it seems like the patience of the American people
[2:46:13.040 --> 2:46:19.840]  and the patriots who have tried and time and time and time again to work within the system
[2:46:19.840 --> 2:46:25.200]  to behave themselves and trust that the system would serve those that serve themselves well
[2:46:25.200 --> 2:46:31.680]  time and time again we have been rejected and rebuffed and so now that spirit of American
[2:46:31.680 --> 2:46:38.240]  resistance the revolution upon which our country was founded is not dead yet and rears its
[2:46:38.880 --> 2:46:45.280]  powerful head as we are watching live these various flags the Betsy Ross flag the uh
[2:46:45.280 --> 2:46:50.000]  Episcopalian flag would you mind you guys mind throwing up that warning back on the screen
[2:46:50.000 --> 2:46:58.240]  once again we had a warning from the mayor of dc mariel bowser who I believe has issued a curfew
[2:46:58.240 --> 2:47:04.800]  is issued an emergency shutdown here it is mayor bowser issued citywide curfew for dc for Wednesday
[2:47:04.800 --> 2:47:10.000]  january 6 starting at 6 p.m until thursday january 7th at 6 a.m essential workers including
[2:47:10.000 --> 2:47:14.880]  healthcare personnel and media are exempt good luck enforcing that I don't remember
[2:47:14.880 --> 2:47:19.040]  such a curfew being issued for black lives matter are antifa when they're running around
[2:47:19.040 --> 2:47:24.320]  burning down historic churches attacking innocent people assaulting police officers here we see
[2:47:24.320 --> 2:47:30.880]  trump supporters not engaged in in meaningless pointless impotent violence but rather simply
[2:47:30.880 --> 2:47:35.600]  pushing past the police and into the capital building to make themselves known uh trump
[2:47:35.600 --> 2:47:39.760]  supporters chase way outnumbered capital police and throw objects at them this is julio rossus
[2:47:40.320 --> 2:47:44.480]  but again here you see trump supporters actually putting their bodies in front of the police and
[2:47:44.480 --> 2:47:47.840]  just saying hey just keep backing up we're not going to attack you we're not going to hurt you
[2:47:47.840 --> 2:47:54.320]  you are not our enemy uh yeah you don't see this type of behavior from the leftist when they
[2:47:54.880 --> 2:47:59.200]  get going you see a lot of uh attacks of innocent people you see a lot of uh burning
[2:47:59.200 --> 2:48:04.320]  things down you see destruction of valuable sometimes irreplaceable uh property I've seen
[2:48:04.320 --> 2:48:08.880]  no statues torn down here I've seen no egregious violence I've seen no violence really at all
[2:48:08.880 --> 2:48:18.240]  except for the occasional punch thrown or mace can being sprayed uh but we see which is more
[2:48:18.240 --> 2:48:26.080]  effective here guns drawn as we see uh at least three capital city security officers level their
[2:48:26.800 --> 2:48:33.840]  pistols over the furniture that's been piled in the in the uh congressional chamber what is it
[2:48:33.840 --> 2:48:40.080]  okay this is a protester now standing in the speaker's position I believe that's in the uh senate
[2:48:41.040 --> 2:48:46.240]  I believe that's the senate building I'm not mistaken for the senate chamber rather we see
[2:48:46.240 --> 2:48:51.760]  protesters reports of shots shots fired on Capitol Hill as more and more police rush from
[2:48:51.760 --> 2:48:58.320]  throughout the capital city to the capital building in an attempt to uh mitigate or or somehow prevent
[2:48:58.320 --> 2:49:06.960]  or uh do something to stand up against the on rush of Trump loyalists patriots and America
[2:49:06.960 --> 2:49:15.760]  firsters as we move towards the capital building into the capital building and then into the senate
[2:49:15.760 --> 2:49:23.040]  and congressional chamber absolutely incredible mayor bowser issuing a citywide curfew that I
[2:49:23.040 --> 2:49:29.040]  if I had to guess we will be ignored confirming other reports speaker Pelosi has requested the
[2:49:29.040 --> 2:49:33.520]  national guard troops to clear and secure the capital via request from the Capitol Police
[2:49:33.520 --> 2:49:38.960]  Board a DC government official tells me troops are on the way troops are on the way from Donald
[2:49:38.960 --> 2:49:43.120]  J. Trump please support our Capitol Police and law enforcement they're truly on our side of the
[2:49:43.920 --> 2:49:49.360]  on the side of our country stay peaceful that's the word from president trump support our Capitol
[2:49:49.360 --> 2:49:55.840]  police and law enforcement stay peaceful that ship may have sailed mr president armed standoff
[2:49:55.840 --> 2:50:01.520]  reported inside the Capitol building as of three minutes ago according to math matthew keys Trump
[2:50:01.520 --> 2:50:06.320]  supporters have gotten through the doors apparently into the house chamber poor reporter in the house

[2:50:36.000 --> 2:50:41.360]  about what we're enduring at the Capitol uh this from somebody who continuously showed support
[2:50:41.360 --> 2:50:48.000]  and encouragement for the riots that ravaged our country for months and months uh a different story

[2:55:50.080 --> 2:55:56.560]  the capital right now maybe even 100 it looks like people out here and
[2:55:59.280 --> 2:56:06.560]  yeah apparently so so back all right uh all right that's that's oan shroyer there they're on the
[2:56:06.560 --> 2:56:11.840]  scene in washington dc attempting to get a secure lines we can actually hear from then uninterrupted
[2:56:11.840 --> 2:56:17.360]  again the just sheer number of people is overwhelming the cell systems and we're having difficulty
[2:56:17.360 --> 2:56:22.400]  even getting in contact uh with people there but they're getting set up and will soon be able to
[2:56:22.400 --> 2:56:27.040]  give us live updates of what it's like on the street but again we actually have a better view
[2:56:27.040 --> 2:56:31.200]  from then because we're not relying on just what we can see in here we're actually getting it
[2:56:31.200 --> 2:56:36.960]  from a thousand different directions at once i repeat the defense department has just denied a
[2:56:36.960 --> 2:56:43.120]  request by dc officials to deploy the national guard to the us capital they have denied that request
[2:56:43.120 --> 2:56:48.560]  uh this is oh my god this is amazing all right so now we're seeing video of the protesters they
[2:56:48.560 --> 2:56:54.240]  seem to have commandeered a window washing platform and are raising themselves up to the
[2:56:54.240 --> 2:57:00.800]  second floor to perhaps breach the windows there trump flags waving american flags waving
[2:57:00.800 --> 2:57:06.880]  shots have been fired we have reports of one woman shot from a protester a female protester has been
[2:57:06.880 --> 2:57:14.400]  shot by the capital security presumably who is inside the uh house chamber their furniture piled
[2:57:14.400 --> 2:57:18.000]  up against the door there were protesters trying to get through that door shots were fired through
[2:57:18.000 --> 2:57:24.240]  the window of that door and seemingly struck a protester these are the unconfirmed reports
[2:57:24.240 --> 2:57:29.200]  that we were receiving from less than a minute ago and we'll continue to bring you updates
[2:57:29.200 --> 2:57:35.840]  as we get them folks this is the revolution and it's only going to be televised on info wars
[2:57:35.840 --> 2:57:40.880]  dot com i'm receiving updates from all sorts of info warriors through twitter and we're also
[2:57:40.880 --> 2:57:45.600]  simply uh grabbing whatever we can from everybody who's there including including elijah schafer
[2:57:45.600 --> 2:57:51.840]  julia uh julio rossus now we see heavily armed with assault rifles military style rifles body
[2:57:51.840 --> 2:57:57.680]  armor this is the capital police uh seemingly moving in towards the protesters i don't know if we
[2:57:57.680 --> 2:58:04.560]  can expect more violence or if things will perhaps come to a head soon but yes there are tens of
[2:58:04.560 --> 2:58:09.840]  thousands of trump supporters who have yet to enter the capital who have yet to attempt to
[2:58:10.480 --> 2:58:16.800]  breach the capital walls a massive american flag hanging outside of the capital uh scaling the
[2:58:16.800 --> 2:58:23.040]  walls using a window cleaning platform and again to me the most amazing images as of yet are the
[2:58:23.040 --> 2:58:30.240]  furniture piled against the interior door inside the chamber with at least three guards leveling
[2:58:30.240 --> 2:58:37.280]  their uh standard issue pistols through that door and apparently the report is shots have been
[2:58:37.280 --> 2:58:43.360]  fired and at least one protester has been hit folks this is absolutely incredible stay with us
[2:58:43.360 --> 2:58:51.760]  we'll bring you up to date all day this continues due to the covid lockdown destroying the supply

[3:00:12.320 --> 3:00:17.520]  using a window washing platform to raise themselves up to the second level and attempt to break through
[3:00:17.520 --> 3:00:25.920]  windows there this is absolutely unprecedented goings on at the us capital in washington dc we see
[3:00:25.920 --> 3:00:31.360]  their images of protesters lying on the ground with their hands splayed as standing over them
[3:00:31.360 --> 3:00:39.520]  with military rifles leveled are the the backup the well armored and well armed battalions of
[3:00:40.960 --> 3:00:46.800]  capital city police here you can see being you know laying down on the ground these protesters
[3:00:46.800 --> 3:00:51.280]  it's peaceful protest folks mostly peaceful uh trump supporters are just an idea i think you're
[3:00:51.280 --> 3:00:57.520]  aware of that the senate is expected to go back into a session in an alternative session shortly
[3:00:57.520 --> 3:01:03.200]  according to c-span that's the update by ian myles chong i believe we have on shorter back on the
[3:01:03.200 --> 3:01:07.600]  line we had we got cut off there earlier but i think he can hear me oh and are you there
[3:01:08.480 --> 3:01:14.880]  oh he's gonna get okay yeah so the the cellular networks are in constant flux here as we continue
[3:01:14.880 --> 3:01:20.400]  to try to get reports from the ground the videos that are being uploaded are coming intermittently
[3:01:20.400 --> 3:01:25.040]  and we're bringing to those to you just the minute that we get them the second that we get them in
[3:01:25.040 --> 3:01:33.360]  many cases uh trump uh trump has tweeted out his his disappointment in uh pince people uh
[3:01:33.360 --> 3:01:41.120]  posting these videos of the protesters absolutely surrounding and uh slam okay uh bloody woman on
[3:01:41.120 --> 3:01:48.960]  a stretcher right now on msnbc that was three minutes ago by maria hino hinoe jose uh omg
[3:01:48.960 --> 3:01:53.520]  bloody woman on a stretcher right now so that must have been the woman who was shot the tweet from
[3:01:53.520 --> 3:01:57.680]  president trump please support our capital police and law enforcement here we're seeing video from
[3:01:57.680 --> 3:02:04.560]  once again inside the senate chamber you can see the members of the uh of the congress crouching
[3:02:04.560 --> 3:02:12.000]  behind walls hiding after as as gunshots ring out although what has been reported so far is
[3:02:12.000 --> 3:02:18.160]  the only shots that have been fired are from the capital city police out through the door of this
[3:02:18.160 --> 3:02:23.440]  chamber uh at the protesters who are attempting to get in here we see the bloody stretcher and a
[3:02:23.440 --> 3:02:28.800]  woman oh my gosh being uh um oh my god but putting pressure on a wound it looked like
[3:02:28.800 --> 3:02:33.120]  we heard reports you a shot in the arm that looked like she was shot in the chest perhaps the collar
[3:02:33.120 --> 3:02:40.880]  bone but absolutely covered in blood as she's rushed away from the capital this may be the first
[3:02:40.880 --> 3:02:46.160]  casualty of the second american revolution this woman who is presumably oh my god and they're
[3:02:46.160 --> 3:02:53.680]  pumping her wow they're pumping her uh chest that means she was most likely unresponsive uh that woman
[3:02:53.680 --> 3:03:00.640]  may have died or at least sustained a critical energy oh and oh and's on the line now oh and you're
[3:03:00.640 --> 3:03:06.080]  there we're seeing images live images of protesters inside the uh the congressional chamber and we
[3:03:06.080 --> 3:03:11.680]  just saw a very disturbing video of a young woman being wheeled away blood all over her chest her
[3:03:11.680 --> 3:03:18.080]  chest being palpitated by the first responders there it did not look good for her uh you're on
[3:03:18.080 --> 3:03:23.760]  you're on the air now on so uh well we've gotten to a location now where i should be able to talk
[3:03:23.760 --> 3:03:28.080]  without getting interrupted um let me just walk through my day real quick and we can kind of give
[3:03:28.080 --> 3:03:32.960]  you an update uh or or we can go back and forth with the latest update i'm on air right now so
[3:03:32.960 --> 3:03:38.720]  basically okay this is historic the city is going under martial law we caught and people
[3:03:38.720 --> 3:03:42.320]  block of tears with what this is and the footage that first started the storming but then triggered
[3:03:42.320 --> 3:03:49.920]  all this so so alex is going to be breaking that down momentarily um we got to the trump
[3:03:49.920 --> 3:03:54.960]  rally today about 8 a.m there are probably about half a million people there that we could see
[3:03:54.960 --> 3:03:59.920]  the entire washington monument was filled i mean unlike anything we've ever seen half a
[3:03:59.920 --> 3:04:05.360]  million i would say conservatively trump spoke the whole crowd was there till about 2 p.m we
[3:04:05.360 --> 3:04:09.840]  then marched to the capital where it looks like maybe half the crowd has gathered at least 100
[3:04:09.840 --> 3:04:13.680]  thousand people here have surrounded the capital more than a hundred they have maybe even gone
[3:04:13.680 --> 3:04:21.120]  on the war cut all ads on the war room go commercial free uh as soon as uh they can go
[3:04:21.120 --> 3:04:25.680]  commercial free on all shows commercial free i'm telling you folks this is historic they declared
[3:04:25.680 --> 3:04:30.880]  basically martial law they're sending in a national guard it's absolutely insane all because
[3:04:30.880 --> 3:04:36.880]  anti-fub the minute trump announced he was going to come speak anti-fub dressed up like patriot with
[3:04:36.880 --> 3:04:42.160]  knee pads and and and arm pads attacked the police to stage the trigger event so they said so they
[3:04:42.160 --> 3:04:47.680]  triggered this stampede we have the witnesses we have the first and right now i mean again it's
[3:04:47.680 --> 3:04:51.680]  we're on one side of the capital so we can't see both sides but on this side alone there's
[3:04:51.680 --> 3:04:55.920]  probably about a hundred thousand people they've taken the capital grounds they've surrounded
[3:04:55.920 --> 3:05:02.800]  the building itself they're on the actual building uh a structure also as you know that they've gotten
[3:05:02.800 --> 3:05:09.040]  in so this is all developing right now but at least a million people in dc many of which are
[3:05:09.040 --> 3:05:13.840]  surrounding the capital many of which are just still roaming the street and it's going to be
[3:05:13.840 --> 3:05:18.880]  interesting to see what happens at night at 6 p.m but i mean this is crazy i mean we literally own
[3:05:18.880 --> 3:05:25.040]  these streets right now there is not a block uh within the white house or the capital uh or the
[3:05:25.040 --> 3:05:30.240]  supreme court or anything where there's not at least 10 000 100 000 a quarter million truck
[3:05:30.240 --> 3:05:35.920]  supporters and so you know it's it's so it's so tough to really put this into perspective because
[3:05:35.920 --> 3:05:41.280]  here's the deal we're not violent revolutionaries but they've taken our country our country is
[3:05:41.280 --> 3:05:47.120]  occupied and and you can debate all day long what the appropriate response is the point is we finally
[3:05:47.120 --> 3:05:51.440]  have a response and we haven't had any fight in our congress we haven't had any fight in our
[3:05:51.440 --> 3:05:55.440]  legislatures and so this is what's going to happen is we the people are going to have to fight again
[3:05:55.440 --> 3:06:00.560]  we did not come here as violent revolutionaries but the history is definitely being made right
[3:06:00.560 --> 3:06:06.080]  now i don't know if today is the turning point uh that will change the course of american history
[3:06:06.080 --> 3:06:11.600]  or if this is just the the nexus of the beginning of we the people taking our country back but i
[3:06:11.600 --> 3:06:17.120]  mean honestly it's hard it's hard to really put into words it's hard to really vocalize what exactly
[3:06:17.120 --> 3:06:23.200]  i'm witnessing i mean the images will maybe do it justice but uh we're gonna have to see what comes
[3:06:23.200 --> 3:06:28.560]  of this and again we've just been on the ground leading rallies leading marches doing speeches
[3:06:28.560 --> 3:06:33.280]  and it eventually all culminated here at the capital which again i'd say at least a hundred
[3:06:33.280 --> 3:06:37.440]  thousand people i'm looking at on one side of the capital and this isn't even the side they
[3:06:37.440 --> 3:06:43.280]  breached this is the side of the inauguration um stage that they have set up which has also been
[3:06:43.280 --> 3:06:48.640]  taken by trump supporters they've unveiled massive american flags they've put up trump flags on the
[3:06:48.640 --> 3:06:53.200]  scaffolding i mean everywhere you look the whole building surrounded by american flags trump flags
[3:06:53.200 --> 3:06:59.520]  people chaining usa quite frankly it was it gave me chills and good to be seeing this uh but there's
[3:06:59.520 --> 3:07:05.680]  no there's definitely going to be our course out here there's no doubt that the democrats here at
[3:07:05.680 --> 3:07:16.080]  least locally are going to be using this to okay uh yes we are skipping all breaks where um
[3:07:17.280 --> 3:07:21.120]  you're you're breaking up just a little bit there maybe if we can resecure that connection we can
[3:07:21.120 --> 3:07:27.040]  come back to you just let me give you a quick update here uh hundreds of protesters now inside the
[3:07:27.040 --> 3:07:32.400]  us capital building at least one woman has been shot she may be the first casualty of the second
[3:07:32.400 --> 3:07:38.320]  american revolution a woman looked like she was in at least a critical condition uh a first
[3:07:38.320 --> 3:07:44.080]  responder ems worker palpitating her heart as she was rushed off the scene on a gurney
[3:07:44.080 --> 3:07:48.880]  uh blood pouring out from a wound that looked to be in her chest perhaps her collarbone all the
[3:07:48.880 --> 3:07:54.720]  reports say she was shot in the arm the report is that this was a bullet fired through the door of
[3:07:54.720 --> 3:08:00.320]  the chamber uh the congressional chamber the furniture piled up there as protesters tried
[3:08:00.320 --> 3:08:07.440]  to breach we have uh many uh videos many images of people inside senate offices apparently baked
[3:08:07.440 --> 3:08:13.680]  alaska is inside uh one of the office of popular youtube streamer live streamer the crowds continue
[3:08:13.680 --> 3:08:21.840]  to grow a curfew has been issued for six p.m by the mayor of dc nancy plosie has requested the
[3:08:21.840 --> 3:08:26.320]  national guard come in to clear out the capital but that request has been denied by the pentagon
[3:08:26.320 --> 3:08:32.800]  uh protesters roaming the rooms of the u.s capital on live stream uh with complete abandoned
[3:08:32.800 --> 3:08:39.040]  complete access to any information uh they require because this happened so fast that
[3:08:39.040 --> 3:08:45.520]  the senators and congressmen were not able to actually uh do anything to my god i'm seeing
[3:08:45.520 --> 3:08:51.360]  this image again of this woman i mean the blood is everywhere i think that woman's dead i i honestly
[3:08:51.360 --> 3:08:59.920]  think uh this woman has been severely injured if not uh if not killed this is um this is serious
[3:08:59.920 --> 3:09:04.480]  folks president trump in a tweet says i'm asking for everybody at the u.s capital to remain peaceful
[3:09:04.480 --> 3:09:10.160]  no violence this is following a woman having been shot we have people inside the capital in the
[3:09:10.160 --> 3:09:16.720]  marble staircases uh climbing the walls from within uh waving trump flags standing at the
[3:09:16.720 --> 3:09:23.040]  speaker's position in the senate and congressional chambers at least one person shot that's the
[3:09:23.040 --> 3:09:29.040]  woman that we saw on screen hundreds of protesters now within the capital people are responding to
[3:09:29.040 --> 3:09:35.680]  this in almost predictable ways you have people such as uh eric erickson uh yeah eric erickson
[3:09:35.680 --> 3:09:40.320]  saying shoot the protesters wave the rules impeach wave the rules convict wave the rules deny the
[3:09:40.320 --> 3:09:44.880]  ability to run for election again which of course was their plan anyway and all along here we're
[3:09:44.880 --> 3:09:50.480]  seeing images of the security officers firing uh are we so we're not doing breaks anymore i can
[3:09:50.480 --> 3:09:59.920]  ignore that that break clock are we still alive i so as far as i know we're still alive okay all
[3:09:59.920 --> 3:10:05.040]  right yeah we're skipping all breaks uh all day today this is a historic moment and we need to be
[3:10:05.040 --> 3:10:12.240]  live uh without the interruptions that are pre-programmed by uh our radio station affiliates
[3:10:12.240 --> 3:10:15.920]  so we'll keep going through any and all breaks and i'll continue to be here until we get
[3:10:16.480 --> 3:10:21.280]  set up with a say a secure connection to the info wars team that's on the ground there in
[3:10:21.280 --> 3:10:25.600]  washington dc including alex jones and oan shroyer as soon as we get that up and running
[3:10:25.600 --> 3:10:30.480]  uh they will take over and let us know exactly what's going on again we're just getting updates
[3:10:30.480 --> 3:10:37.920]  from all around so eric erickson uh a blue checkmark on twitter uh advocating to simply shoot
[3:10:37.920 --> 3:10:42.880]  all of the protesters to wave the rules impeach wave the rules convict wave the rules deny the
[3:10:42.880 --> 3:10:49.120]  ability to run for election ever again uh which of course this is this is a reaction right they
[3:10:49.120 --> 3:10:54.640]  they riot for an entire year they burn down entire american cities they murder over 30 people
[3:10:54.640 --> 3:11:00.000]  they shoot down trump protesters in cold blood but if you dare to simply put up your hand in
[3:11:00.000 --> 3:11:05.920]  protest to them uh then you're an evil nazi on the other hand if you start to protest if you
[3:11:05.920 --> 3:11:11.760]  start to uh gather in mass and uh and break down doors and and uh and storm the capital
[3:11:11.760 --> 3:11:16.640]  building you deserve to be shot you deserve to be murdered your entire uh political uh
[3:11:16.640 --> 3:11:21.680]  party and everyone involved deserve to be barred forever from uh holding office this is
[3:11:21.680 --> 3:11:27.520]  what's at stake ladies and gentlemen this is what is being decided right now don trump says i am
[3:11:27.520 --> 3:11:31.120]  asking for everyone at the u.s capital to remain peaceful no violence remember we are the party
[3:11:31.120 --> 3:11:35.200]  of law and order respect the law and our great men and women in blue the problem with that mr
[3:11:35.200 --> 3:11:42.480]  president is that we have we have for four years and we've been abused for four years we've tried
[3:11:42.480 --> 3:11:47.280]  to remain peaceful we've tried to remain law-abiding for the last years our cities were burned around
[3:11:47.280 --> 3:11:52.480]  us as we were locked inside of our own homes as criminals were given complete abandon as time
[3:11:52.480 --> 3:11:58.640]  after time antifa and black lives matter protesters were arrested in violent acts and then released
[3:11:58.640 --> 3:12:03.200]  the next day to perform them again time and time again we have tried to be the party of law and
[3:12:03.200 --> 3:12:09.120]  order we have tried to respect the status quo the laws the system as we wish to uphold it instead
[3:12:10.080 --> 3:12:13.680]  we've been disappointed we've been betrayed we've been stabbed in the back
[3:12:13.680 --> 3:12:20.320]  literally many times now perhaps the patients has run out and we're seeing images here on the
[3:12:20.320 --> 3:12:28.240]  screen of this woman who was shot who was taken out on the on the um uh um gurney that we saw earlier
[3:12:28.240 --> 3:12:34.320]  she is not looking responsive we see people there attempting to put pressure on the wound we saw the
[3:12:34.320 --> 3:12:39.120]  aftermath of this as she's wheeled away from the store my god this is brutal folks this is
[3:12:39.120 --> 3:12:48.880]  incredibly brutal wow this is absolutely incredible but uh again once again what you're seeing from
[3:12:48.880 --> 3:12:56.640]  the left is they want uh total authoritarianism they want a complete shutdown of any and all
[3:12:56.640 --> 3:13:03.360]  ability for trump supporters or conservatives to stand up for ourselves so far the only violence
[3:13:03.360 --> 3:13:08.320]  that has been committed this day has been against the protesters who are there we just saw a
[3:13:08.320 --> 3:13:13.040]  protester shot uh i would not be surprised if we soon receive reports that she's passed away
[3:13:13.040 --> 3:13:17.120]  that was a brutal shot it looked like right to her chest these were people trying to get in
[3:13:17.120 --> 3:13:23.520]  through the door of the uh chamber and apparently she was shot by a security guard that's the reports
[3:13:23.520 --> 3:13:27.360]  that we're hearing on the ground these are unconfirmed for this is uh all the information
[3:13:27.360 --> 3:13:33.680]  that we have so far once again you have to think about the fact that for six months and for years
[3:13:33.680 --> 3:13:38.960]  before that how many times did we see leftist try to tear down the doors of the capitol building
[3:13:38.960 --> 3:13:45.360]  we saw leftists uh during the kavanaugh hearings attempting to tear down the door can you imagine
[3:13:45.360 --> 3:13:51.440]  if one of these protesters unarmed peaceful attempting to simply open a door is shot at
[3:13:51.440 --> 3:13:58.800]  point blank in cold blood by one of these one of these uh capital police this is egregious this
[3:13:58.800 --> 3:14:05.360]  is unacceptable tear gas now being deployed within the capital uh this is shocking and astonishing
[3:14:05.360 --> 3:14:11.120]  and again uh the only violence i have seen perpetrated so far beyond uh you know one or two
[3:14:11.120 --> 3:14:16.400]  you know punches in in return for a punch thrown by a police officer the only violence i have seen
[3:14:16.400 --> 3:14:22.880]  has been the cold blooded point blank shooting of a woman in the chest by the capital city the
[3:14:22.880 --> 3:14:29.360]  capital police rather this is uh this is disturbing and of course the leftists are saying just shoot
[3:14:29.360 --> 3:14:33.520]  them all you know if you dare protest against us we can protest we can burn your city down for a
[3:14:33.520 --> 3:14:38.960]  year and a half we can do you know for a year uh for four years we can just um obstruct everything
[3:14:38.960 --> 3:14:43.520]  we can destroy everything we can murder people in cold blood vice magazine will uh give us a
[3:14:43.520 --> 3:14:50.880]  uh a good 30 minute documentary in order to air our views to smear the dead man to call him racist
[3:14:50.880 --> 3:14:55.760]  in a bigot in a nazi in order to justify his death that's the reaction you get if you are a
[3:14:55.760 --> 3:15:00.720]  protester on the left you get complete carte blanche even if you're caught in the act even if
[3:15:00.720 --> 3:15:05.040]  you resist arrest even if you attack police officers you'll be taking to the prosecutor who
[3:15:05.040 --> 3:15:11.760]  takes their orders from the Soros funded organizations to let you go immediately punish you not at all
[3:15:11.760 --> 3:15:18.640]  and allow you the very next day to go out and destroy and uh cavort once again so
[3:15:21.120 --> 3:15:26.400]  tables have turned if you're a republican if you are a conservative if you actually protest in an
[3:15:26.400 --> 3:15:32.560]  effective and aggressive way in the exact same way that has been protested for the last year
[3:15:33.120 --> 3:15:38.400]  you apparently deserve to be shot down in cold blood even though you're unarmed even though
[3:15:38.400 --> 3:15:44.080]  you're peaceful even though as we've heard time and time again hey things can be replaced stuff
[3:15:44.080 --> 3:15:52.720]  can be replaced well you'll be shot down cold dead your blood spilling on the floor of the capital
[3:15:52.720 --> 3:15:59.680]  this is this is absolutely incredible absolutely unbelievable hundreds of protesters now in the
[3:15:59.680 --> 3:16:06.080]  u.s capital tear gas uh being spread looks like we're getting uh more updates protesters now
[3:16:06.080 --> 3:16:10.640]  on the highest floor on the house floor rifling through lawmakers desks it'll be interesting
[3:16:10.640 --> 3:16:16.160]  to see what information it comes from this people are already investigating the uh things that are
[3:16:16.160 --> 3:16:22.800]  being found on stuff like the nancy polices computer and of course on the right people on
[3:16:22.800 --> 3:16:28.720]  twitter are now reposting uh tweets from people like alexander akasio-cortez who says the whole
[3:16:28.720 --> 3:16:33.200]  point of protesting is make people uncomfortable activists take that discomfort with the status
[3:16:33.200 --> 3:16:38.400]  quo and advocate for concrete policy changes popular support often starts small and grows
[3:16:38.400 --> 3:16:42.720]  to folks who complain protests demands make others uncomfortable that's the point
[3:16:43.520 --> 3:16:49.760]  mm-hmm and the double standard rises again if the democrats didn't have a double standard they
[3:16:49.760 --> 3:16:55.360]  wouldn't have standards at all mylo yinopolis writes on twitter quote all i need now is alex
[3:16:55.360 --> 3:17:00.880]  jones in the speaker's chair alex jones oan shroyer and the info wars crew is not currently
[3:17:00.880 --> 3:17:05.920]  inside the capital i don't believe they're even on the capital grounds i think they're in a secure
[3:17:05.920 --> 3:17:12.160]  building uh just a little ways away overlooking all of this chaos going on and attempting and
[3:17:12.160 --> 3:17:18.960]  trying and uh striving to set up a more secure uh phone line and video line so we can be taking
[3:17:18.960 --> 3:17:23.440]  their feed and hearing from them on the ground what exactly is happening once again eric erickson
[3:17:23.440 --> 3:17:29.520]  on twitter has been deleted it's got 715 likes that he says shoot the protesters wave the rules
[3:17:29.520 --> 3:17:33.600]  impeach wave the rules convict wave the rules deny the ability to run for election again of course
[3:17:33.600 --> 3:17:39.200]  this is standard for uh the democrats they have said time and time again as this election has
[3:17:39.200 --> 3:17:43.520]  wound down the moment don trump is out of office they'll be prosecuting him they'll be prosecuting
[3:17:43.520 --> 3:17:47.600]  anybody that supported him they'll be sending to jail anybody that dared to support the president
[3:17:47.600 --> 3:17:52.400]  of the united states that in and of itself is a greater threat to the american system and the
[3:17:52.400 --> 3:18:00.720]  republic as fragile as it is that uh sentiment the those uh expressions are more of a threat to
[3:18:00.720 --> 3:18:06.400]  our system and our country than this protest ever could be once the system itself starts
[3:18:06.400 --> 3:18:12.080]  persecuting people politically starts prosecuting people for their political views starts punishing
[3:18:12.080 --> 3:18:17.120]  people with the full uh weight and force of the state behind them because of their differing
[3:18:17.120 --> 3:18:22.560]  political views that is the death of the republic from ted cruz he says quote those
[3:18:22.560 --> 3:18:26.560]  storming the capital need to stop now the constitution protects peaceful protest but
[3:18:26.560 --> 3:18:30.320]  violence from the left or right is always wrong i've not seen any violence i've not seen any
[3:18:30.320 --> 3:18:34.960]  violence from the protesters yet am i wrong can the crew tell me have i seen have i seen
[3:18:34.960 --> 3:18:39.280]  violence from the protesters they've broken a few windows they've torn down some barriers
[3:18:40.080 --> 3:18:44.320]  i've seen one or two throw uh you know throw a punch here there but they usually get you know
[3:18:44.320 --> 3:18:48.720]  that i think all those people have been sort of arrested and and pulled away i've seen no
[3:18:49.280 --> 3:18:54.800]  violence on behalf of the protesters only being committed against them so ted cruz can tell the
[3:18:54.800 --> 3:19:01.040]  police officers don't shoot peaceful protesters how about the police don't gun down innocent
[3:19:01.040 --> 3:19:06.000]  protesters who are unarmed because that's what's happening right now that's what's just happened
[3:19:06.720 --> 3:19:13.120]  and we've not received an update yet of that young woman who was shot point blank through a window
[3:19:13.120 --> 3:19:20.480]  by the capital city police that's what we're seeing now and we're seeing uh rifle armed terrified
[3:19:20.480 --> 3:19:26.640]  looking police officers capital officers uh keeping people down like hostages there in the uh
[3:19:27.520 --> 3:19:34.000]  in or near the rotunda but yes leftists advocating to shoot the protesters while being
[3:19:34.960 --> 3:19:42.240]  presented with their own sentiments from earlier this year saying that uh protests are good you're
[3:19:42.240 --> 3:19:48.080]  supposed to be uncomfortable you're supposed to be uncomfortable crowd continues to increase in size
[3:19:48.800 --> 3:19:56.480]  we'll continue to bring you updates videos images and information as we get it my god
[3:19:58.240 --> 3:20:02.480]  the images of this gunshot victim are truly harrowing
[3:20:04.960 --> 3:20:09.360]  hard drives says from nicole arbor hard drives from offices in the capital have been taken
[3:20:09.360 --> 3:20:15.280]  by citizens this is bananas so looks like the people who have been able to successfully break
[3:20:15.280 --> 3:20:22.880]  into uh senate offices and congressional offices uh did so with such swiftness that the protesters
[3:20:22.880 --> 3:20:29.520]  there were i'm sorry the uh the staffers and congressmen and senators there were unable to
[3:20:29.520 --> 3:20:35.360]  even grab their information grab their papers or even shut down their computers so now unlocked
[3:20:35.360 --> 3:20:40.960]  and open to anybody those computers are being accessed by the protesters who themselves are
[3:20:40.960 --> 3:20:46.640]  gathering information downloading hard drives or stealing the hard drives outright uh we can
[3:20:46.640 --> 3:20:51.760]  expect to see the fallout from this continue on for a very long time but i remind you again
[3:20:51.760 --> 3:21:00.240]  after a year of complete chaos a year of protest a year of literally tens of thousands of violent
[3:21:00.240 --> 3:21:06.400]  riots with dozens of murders uh i mean just trillions of dollars worth of damage maybe not
[3:21:06.400 --> 3:21:12.800]  truly but many many billions of dollars worth of damage to american cities we've heard time and
[3:21:12.800 --> 3:21:18.880]  time again how valuable uh protests are how good protests are how antifa is only an idea how black
[3:21:18.880 --> 3:21:25.120]  lives matter is uh simply a set of beliefs that if you don't believe you're racist uh and we've
[3:21:25.120 --> 3:21:30.240]  watched silently because we always knew that the end of the day we had our vote we always knew
[3:21:30.240 --> 3:21:34.640]  that when it came right down to it the american system was powerful enough flexible enough
[3:21:36.800 --> 3:21:46.480]  good enough to maintain and we knew that if we just trusted and exerted our rights as members of
[3:21:46.480 --> 3:21:53.920]  a republican citizens of this democracy that we could regain our footing and get back on track well
[3:21:53.920 --> 3:21:59.520]  that vote has been stolen from us if you're wondering what is inspiring the overwhelming
[3:22:01.440 --> 3:22:06.320]  activity that we're seeing here at the capital as trump supporters move into the capital building
[3:22:06.960 --> 3:22:13.680]  and start to destroy things it's that that last release valve has been taken destroyed perverted
[3:22:13.680 --> 3:22:21.760]  and prevented from being accessed and used by the people who for so long have patiently stood by and
[3:22:21.760 --> 3:22:27.040]  watch their country literally burned around them now i haven't seen any of these protesters tear
[3:22:27.040 --> 3:22:33.120]  down statues i haven't seen any of these protesters commit violence i haven't seen any of them attack
[3:22:33.120 --> 3:22:38.080]  police in fact quite to the contrary i've seen police retreating with trump protesters standing
[3:22:38.080 --> 3:22:44.400]  in front of the police officers holding up their hands preventing other protesters from doing anything
[3:22:44.400 --> 3:22:49.760]  untoward this just in from disclos.tv dc mayor bowser is asking again to deploy the national
[3:22:49.760 --> 3:22:56.800]  guard pentagon is considering it but concerned about uniformed troops in the capital that would
[3:22:56.800 --> 3:23:04.960]  be a major major major step in the history of america to have the united states army occupy
[3:23:04.960 --> 3:23:11.280]  the capital now nothing like this in as far as i know has ever occurred in the history of the united
[3:23:11.280 --> 3:23:17.440]  states this is a utterly unique situation an unprecedented situation that we are now watching
[3:23:17.440 --> 3:23:22.720]  live and of course if you are not watching info wars you may be getting your information from
[3:23:22.720 --> 3:23:29.120]  one of the mainstream sources in which case you are just now hearing that quote police draw guns
[3:23:29.120 --> 3:23:39.200]  inside us congress to protect to protect lawmakers okay the reality is guns were drawn
[3:23:39.200 --> 3:23:44.640]  a standoff ensued and an unarmed protester was shot in the chest and has now been evacuated
[3:23:44.640 --> 3:23:51.680]  and from all appearances is in critical condition at least with her heart her chest being palpitated
[3:23:51.680 --> 3:23:56.800]  by the emergency responder as she's wheeled away on a gurney blood pouring forth from that wound
[3:23:58.320 --> 3:24:04.480]  this is the up-to-date information one woman in critical condition thank god oh my god all right
[3:24:04.480 --> 3:24:09.280]  i thought she was dead i thought for sure this woman had died it's still touch and go obviously
[3:24:09.280 --> 3:24:13.920]  critical condition means anything could happen but this is the update from bno news on twitter one
[3:24:13.920 --> 3:24:19.280]  woman in critical condition after being shot in the chest at the us capital truly incredible
[3:24:20.400 --> 3:24:26.480]  truly incredible and we're seeing images of this event come across and once again
[3:24:28.560 --> 3:24:34.000]  just just imagine just imagine folks if this had been a leftist antifa black lives matter first of
[3:24:34.000 --> 3:24:39.520]  all the police would have backed down the police would have kneeled the police would have joined
[3:24:39.520 --> 3:24:47.360]  them no doubt on the behest of their corrupt crooked city government instead gunshots fired
[3:24:48.080 --> 3:24:56.000]  bullets shot at the peaceful protesters and one woman now in critical condition thank god
[3:24:56.000 --> 3:25:01.840]  we're praying for her because i thought for sure from that image that she would not not make it
[3:25:01.840 --> 3:25:06.000]  woman who was trying to breach the doors inside the us capital was shot in the neck by the capital
[3:25:06.000 --> 3:25:13.120]  police she's since been brought out of the building on a stretcher this is this is absolutely absurd
[3:25:13.120 --> 3:25:19.680]  and we're hearing uh we're hearing calls from the republic and you know it's almost it i don't know
[3:25:21.760 --> 3:25:23.280]  i don't want to say anything i shouldn't say
[3:25:26.080 --> 3:25:30.560]  this just in that georgia and kansas capital buildings have been stormed by protesters so
[3:25:30.560 --> 3:25:37.120]  now it sounds like uh the state capital buildings have been stormed by protesters it's amazing isn't
[3:25:37.120 --> 3:25:44.320]  it that uh again after after six months eight months an entire year of protest by antifa and
[3:25:44.320 --> 3:25:48.800]  black lives matter you ask a democratic lawmaker about it he says i never even heard of such a
[3:25:48.800 --> 3:25:53.040]  thing what is this defund the police i've never heard anybody say defund the police that's what
[3:25:53.040 --> 3:26:00.880]  bernie sanders said jerry nadler and tifa is just an idea right it's conspiracy theory uh meanwhile
[3:26:00.880 --> 3:26:07.360]  we are about two hours into this insanity going on in the capital building and already republican
[3:26:07.360 --> 3:26:13.200]  lawmakers are condemning their own supporters telling them uh that they're at fault that they're
[3:26:13.200 --> 3:26:18.240]  the ones being violent while the only violence that i've seen perpetrated thus far have been
[3:26:18.240 --> 3:26:24.400]  flash bangs fired into the trump crowds and a woman shot in the chest and neck area who is
[3:26:24.400 --> 3:26:29.200]  now in critical condition after being fired upon point blank while she was trying to open a door
[3:26:29.200 --> 3:26:39.680]  into the congressional chamber it's uh it's an illustration isn't it it's an example of the
[3:26:39.680 --> 3:26:45.520]  two different approaches now again for a year the patriots have put up with the chaos they've put
[3:26:45.520 --> 3:26:51.920]  up with the destruction they have held their tongue kept their guns holstered kept their weapons
[3:26:52.720 --> 3:27:00.720]  at their side and allowed the literal i mean communist agitators funded paid for by foreigners
[3:27:00.720 --> 3:27:06.560]  trained by chinese communists and they've been allowed to perpetrate the most egregious violence
[3:27:06.560 --> 3:27:13.200]  all over the united states for a year and it seems like finally after having been robbed of their
[3:27:13.200 --> 3:27:19.760]  their last release that that final chance of we can we can at least vote we at least have our vote
[3:27:19.760 --> 3:27:25.840]  you know all that got robbed from them and was in the process of being robbed from them today
[3:27:25.840 --> 3:27:33.920]  when all of this chaos broke out i'm serious i don't think there's i have not seen violence from
[3:27:33.920 --> 3:27:38.480]  the from the protest i've seen them tear down barriers i've seen them break windows i've seen
[3:27:38.480 --> 3:27:44.800]  them uh push and shove at cops i've seen one guy throw a punch at a cop after the cop punched him
[3:27:44.800 --> 3:27:51.280]  i've seen mace being sprayed in both directions i've seen a mere percentage of a percentage of
[3:27:51.280 --> 3:27:58.240]  the violence we saw on nearly a daily basis starting in about march of last year and continuing
[3:27:58.240 --> 3:28:04.160]  all the way through the summer with tens of thousands of riots a large portion of which
[3:28:04.160 --> 3:28:09.760]  were not just violent but deadly at the hands of protesters who were never caught never punished
[3:28:09.760 --> 3:28:17.760]  and never even addressed or acknowledged by their constituent or by their representatives again
[3:28:17.760 --> 3:28:22.800]  from disclose dot tv urgent uh pull it back up virginia national guard and 200 state troopers
[3:28:22.800 --> 3:28:28.320]  are now being deployed to washington dc so while the pentagon has denied uh the
[3:28:28.320 --> 3:28:34.320]  dc mayor and nancy plosie they've denied sending
[3:28:36.400 --> 3:28:42.160]  sending soldiers into the capital it looks like the virginia national guard and 200 state troopers
[3:28:42.160 --> 3:28:46.960]  are now being deployed to washington dc we've heard reports of georgia and kansas state houses
[3:28:46.960 --> 3:28:54.000]  both having been occupied both having been attacked and we're seeing uh live view on fox news and other
[3:28:54.000 --> 3:29:00.160]  places of heavily armed heavily armored police officers moving towards the u.s capital
[3:29:01.760 --> 3:29:07.200]  and again that woman who was shot is in critical condition as of now uh and again and now we're
[3:29:07.200 --> 3:29:17.920]  also seeing from kim dunne on twitter the tunnels that were used to to bring uh bring up so it looks
[3:29:17.920 --> 3:29:30.240]  like uh this is i mean this is just mind-blowing folks um i'm having trouble uh getting a good
[3:29:30.240 --> 3:29:35.840]  grip on exactly what's going on uh from bno news large number of police and swat vehicles
[3:29:35.840 --> 3:29:40.960]  are moving towards washington dc right now and we actually have a video of the police officer
[3:29:40.960 --> 3:29:46.640]  shooting the woman inside united states capital building and again just imagine folks if on the
[3:29:46.640 --> 3:29:52.720]  first day of black lives matter rallies uh the black lives matter riots uh one of their protesters
[3:29:52.720 --> 3:29:58.800]  who was unarmed a woman was shot at point blank range in the chest by a police officer would
[3:29:58.800 --> 3:30:04.960]  we ever hear the end of it would this not be an example of the tyranny of the fascism that they
[3:30:04.960 --> 3:30:13.040]  love to uh to portray uh the violence and destruction taking place the u.s capital must
[3:30:13.040 --> 3:30:16.880]  stop this is a tweet by mike pence the violence and destruction taking place the u.s capital
[3:30:16.880 --> 3:30:21.360]  must stop and it must stop now anybody involved must respect law enforcement officers and immediately
[3:30:21.360 --> 3:30:26.400]  leave the building you continue to say peaceful protest is a right of every american but this
[3:30:26.400 --> 3:30:30.400]  attack on our capital will not be tolerated and those involved will be prosecuted to the fullest
[3:30:30.400 --> 3:30:35.760]  extent of the law wouldn't that be a change wouldn't that be something new protesters prosecuted
[3:30:35.760 --> 3:30:42.240]  how many how many hundreds of thousands of people have been arrested in places like in
[3:30:42.240 --> 3:30:50.000]  teeth uh places like um portland washington minnesota michigan have been taken to the
[3:30:50.000 --> 3:30:56.640]  prosecutor released that very day to be out on the street committing the same crime being arrested
[3:30:56.640 --> 3:31:02.720]  once again the very next day time and time again this has occurred but i wouldn't doubt it i wouldn't
[3:31:02.720 --> 3:31:10.080]  put it past them you know that the way our country is right now the full force and weight of every
[3:31:10.080 --> 3:31:18.000]  single system every single law enforcement agency will be brought to bear and they will
[3:31:18.000 --> 3:31:21.920]  attempt to make an example out of anybody and everybody involved in this
[3:31:21.920 --> 3:31:31.440]  where we go from here is hard to tell hard to say
[3:31:33.600 --> 3:31:38.080]  trump encouraging his supporters to stay peaceful which they have they absolutely have
[3:31:38.800 --> 3:31:44.080]  once again no i didn't see any people attacking police i didn't see them throwing rocks or bricks
[3:31:44.080 --> 3:31:54.160]  at the police as we saw in places like chicago throughout the summer who's this uh representative
[3:31:54.160 --> 3:32:00.080]  david trone says i'm safe we've been evacuated let me be clear we will not be stopped by this
[3:32:00.080 --> 3:32:05.440]  lawless intimidation that's how you got here isn't it lawless intimidation isn't that what
[3:32:05.440 --> 3:32:10.400]  brought us to this point the lawlessness and intimidation being exerted by black lives matter
[3:32:10.400 --> 3:32:19.760]  in antifa were the better part of a year and once again i mean if this were the democrats doing it
[3:32:20.880 --> 3:32:25.520]  we would see exactly the same images that we see here today and the democrats would be out
[3:32:25.520 --> 3:32:31.200]  there saying trump supporters don't exist that's a fiction of your imagination that's what gerry
[3:32:31.200 --> 3:32:38.160]  nadler said said antifa is a fiction a part of your imagination it's a fiction it's a lie it
[3:32:38.160 --> 3:32:44.240]  doesn't exist it's a right-wing conspiracy theory that's what he said about antifa months and months
[3:32:44.240 --> 3:32:48.480]  after the riots had begun and continued on a daily basis he said it doesn't exist
[3:32:50.400 --> 3:32:55.760]  kaylan mckinney at president trump's directive the national guard okay all right so he's so
[3:32:55.760 --> 3:33:04.560]  president trump is sending the national guard now he never sent it for uh for antifa okay we
[3:33:04.560 --> 3:33:09.840]  have owens shroyer now overlooking the u.s capital massive crowds over his shoulder
[3:33:09.840 --> 3:33:16.160]  uh jet one two three four doing a quick audio check let me know whenever um he can hear me
[3:33:16.160 --> 3:33:23.840]  owen can you read it say we now go all right um all right folks so we have owens shroyer and the
[3:33:23.840 --> 3:33:28.080]  info wars crew in washington dc overlooking the u.s capital we now go live to owens shroyer in
[3:33:28.080 --> 3:33:35.760]  washington dc ladies and gentlemen owens shroyer here for info wars dot com and i'm really not quite
[3:33:35.760 --> 3:33:42.400]  sure how to tell you the history that we're witnessing here today other than for you to just see
[3:33:42.400 --> 3:33:50.400]  the actual images of millions of patriots rallying for trump today chanting usa
[3:33:50.400 --> 3:34:00.720]  a capital building where they have now breached the grounds and are now surrounding the capital
[3:34:00.720 --> 3:34:06.960]  building now these are the types of events that go down in history this january sixth
[3:34:06.960 --> 3:34:15.360]  2021 will no doubt go down in american history now what will that history say about today we're
[3:34:15.360 --> 3:34:19.440]  here fighting for president trump we're here fighting for our elections we're here fighting
[3:34:19.440 --> 3:34:26.880]  for the republic we want to use this day as we're seeing all the traders in the republican party
[3:34:26.880 --> 3:34:33.360]  and congress everywhere stab us in the back we all know trump won we all know they stole it we saw
[3:34:33.360 --> 3:34:38.080]  the hundreds of thousands of illegal ballots they gave biden the victory in georgia come in at six
[3:34:38.080 --> 3:34:43.680]  a.m they counted for weeks we saw the hundred thousand ballots that came in for biden in michigan
[3:34:43.680 --> 3:34:54.160]  at six a.m they gave him we all saw it happen and they want to tell us oh no that didn't happen
[3:34:54.160 --> 3:34:58.560]  that's not happening kind of like when they go on air when there's burning buildings behind them
[3:34:58.560 --> 3:35:02.160]  and they say this is a peaceful protest but there's burning buildings behind them
[3:35:04.160 --> 3:35:10.160]  a peaceful protest nothing has been burned but then people apparently have been shot inside the
[3:35:10.160 --> 3:35:15.600]  capital now we're still getting intel on what that is we've gotten to a safe location because it was
[3:35:15.600 --> 3:35:20.000]  just too crazy out there on the streets but and that was capital police that's probably false
[3:35:20.000 --> 3:35:24.320]  that's the left probably we're going to later and tell us probably false what's false the shooting
[3:35:24.320 --> 3:35:28.560]  inside well there was i mean a woman came out in a gurney bleeder so i don't know who we don't
[3:35:28.560 --> 3:35:33.680]  know who did it point is this crazy point is i'm again this is just in there there's video now
[3:35:33.680 --> 3:35:41.440]  right now and pence is now taking place so now pence has also betrayed president donald trump so
[3:35:42.240 --> 3:35:48.400]  trump is now a man on a on a mountain by himself and he has we the people fighting for him by the way
[3:35:48.400 --> 3:35:53.760]  the police just confirmed one woman was shot the leg inside the capital so we've had one person shot
[3:35:53.760 --> 3:36:00.800]  but again they breached the building and they got in while they were voting to either certify
[3:36:00.800 --> 3:36:05.200]  or debate whether they were going to certify for biden or not and that's when it happened
[3:36:06.000 --> 3:36:12.640]  and so all hell is broken loose they have the underground tunnels which we told you they were
[3:36:12.640 --> 3:36:19.200]  going to do yesterday and in fact they did do yesterday so look we want freedom we want liberty
[3:36:19.200 --> 3:36:24.160]  and when the government fears the people we have that now we don't want them to feel that there's
[3:36:24.160 --> 3:36:30.160]  a violent revolution coming but we want them to know that we the people are not going to stand
[3:36:30.160 --> 3:36:34.400]  for their treason and we the people are not going to stand for rigged elections now
[3:36:35.200 --> 3:36:39.600]  people can debate all day long we are skipping this break we're continuing live through the
[3:36:39.600 --> 3:36:44.720]  breaks on info wars dot com and band dot video the live streams are continuing the radio stations
[3:36:44.720 --> 3:36:49.120]  may be going to break now but we'll be right back on the other side but stay with us if you're online
[3:36:49.120 --> 3:36:53.360]  because the the streams will continue and we go back to own shroyer live outside of the capital
[3:36:53.360 --> 3:36:57.840]  our elections has been completely violated what is the appropriate response well you can debate it
[3:36:57.840 --> 3:37:03.920]  all day long but the response we've seen today is millions of trump supporters rallying in dc
[3:37:05.040 --> 3:37:09.200]  listening to trump speak listening to others speak they were here yesterday all night as well
[3:37:10.080 --> 3:37:16.080]  and then today coming to the capital and breaching the grounds now we have eyewitness testimony
[3:37:17.040 --> 3:37:24.080]  that says it looks like there were agent provocateurs who actually started the breaching
[3:37:24.080 --> 3:37:28.320]  procedure but because there were so many trump supporters around it was just like a flood of
[3:37:28.320 --> 3:37:34.960]  momentum oh somebody's coming in oh the barrier went down oh now we're just all going in led to
[3:37:34.960 --> 3:37:40.880]  at least one person getting shot and then just all hell breaking loose and last night there was
[3:37:40.880 --> 3:37:46.880]  already some tensions between the local police here and trump supporters because they initiated
[3:37:46.880 --> 3:37:52.000]  a curfew said you can't go to bars you can't go to restaurants so people are just out in the streets
[3:37:52.000 --> 3:37:55.680]  because they got nowhere else to go so they're out in the streets and then the police come in
[3:37:55.680 --> 3:38:01.200]  to try to shut them down rush them uh bull rush them arrest people and so that caused tension last
[3:38:01.200 --> 3:38:09.120]  night and then i think that spilled over to today we are capturing this history for you right now
[3:38:09.120 --> 3:38:15.120]  live on info wars and it's really just an incredible thing because i don't think these people are going
[3:38:15.120 --> 3:38:23.600]  anywhere this crowd has been holding now for at least an hour and they have the building completely
[3:38:23.600 --> 3:38:32.400]  surrounded now it is cold out here and it looks uh to me now like people are gathering around
[3:38:32.400 --> 3:38:37.520]  the different entrances of the capital so it looks like what where the crowd used to be
[3:38:37.520 --> 3:38:44.720]  completely dispersed around it it now looks like there is a a funnel if you will a surge
[3:38:44.720 --> 3:38:48.880]  of people going into a side entrance and then a surge of people over here but as you can see
[3:38:49.440 --> 3:38:56.640]  the inauguration stage that has been set up has been completely overwhelmed so they have hung
[3:38:56.640 --> 3:39:01.680]  obviously what is it looks like about a hundred foot long american flag you've got trunk flags
[3:39:01.680 --> 3:39:06.560]  everywhere american flags everywhere so we just want to send a peaceful message to the globalist
[3:39:06.560 --> 3:39:11.840]  to the chinese who own half of our congress and then mike pence and the congress members hey we voted
[3:39:11.840 --> 3:39:17.360]  for donald trump he won the election you know it you better do the right thing and not certify the
[3:39:17.360 --> 3:39:23.360]  fake vote for biden because then it gets even worse hey it's one thing to have to deal with the theft
[3:39:23.360 --> 3:39:30.240]  of our election it's another thing to now have to deal with we have a compromised foreign agent
[3:39:30.240 --> 3:39:37.600]  criminal who is wanted in the country of ukraine he is a wanted felon in the country of ukraine
[3:39:37.600 --> 3:39:44.400]  doing business deals in china his son in russia kazakhstan i ran all over the globe so that he
[3:39:44.400 --> 3:39:49.200]  can sell us out so we don't want to get to that point again you can debate what is the proper
[3:39:49.200 --> 3:39:54.240]  response to two billion dollars in property damage with no with no law and then them stealing our
[3:39:54.240 --> 3:39:59.440]  election you can debate that this is the response we see but now the debate will become if truly
[3:39:59.440 --> 3:40:03.040]  pence is going to stab us in the back with the rest of congress now the debate is what do you do
[3:40:03.040 --> 3:40:07.840]  with a foreign agent as president of the united states that is an illegitimate unelected president
[3:40:07.840 --> 3:40:14.000]  but a stolen president and quite frankly folks i got to be honest here we're we've been on the streets
[3:40:14.000 --> 3:40:24.960]  all day the energy the it's hard to even know what to say or how to handle it and i know that alex

[3:43:04.640 --> 3:43:09.680]  shot on the capital grounds is in critical condition five others including a law enforcement officer
[3:43:09.680 --> 3:43:17.120]  has have also been sent to a hospital uh the entire national guard in washington dc has been activated
[3:43:17.120 --> 3:43:24.240]  and from this is uh unconfirmed but it does say that protesters are engaging us secret service
[3:43:24.240 --> 3:43:31.520]  hand to hand combat again that's uh unconfirmed i'm not sure if that's a troll post or not
[3:43:31.520 --> 3:43:35.600]  mike pence has said the violence and destruction taking place the us capital must stop and it must
[3:43:35.600 --> 3:43:39.680]  stop now anybody involved must respect law enforcement officers and immediately leave the
[3:43:39.680 --> 3:43:44.080]  building this attack on our capital will not be tolerated and those involved will be prosecuted
[3:43:44.080 --> 3:43:54.400]  to the fullest extent of the law absolutely incredible stuff akim jeffrey says members plan to
[3:43:54.400 --> 3:44:00.480]  return and certify the electoral college members from both parties applaud but first they're still
[3:44:00.480 --> 3:44:04.960]  clearing the capital the media is calling the riot an insurrection
[3:44:07.200 --> 3:44:10.880]  yeah wouldn't it be wouldn't it be amazing to be a democrat wouldn't it be wouldn't it just be
[3:44:10.880 --> 3:44:14.160]  absolutely amazing if we were the mainstream media and we could sit here with all of this
[3:44:14.160 --> 3:44:18.720]  going on with people being shot with the capital building broken into and we could just sit here
[3:44:18.720 --> 3:44:26.000]  and go well a small peaceful gathering of trump supporters occurred earlier today it was nothing
[3:44:26.000 --> 3:44:31.600]  really to see no one was hurt nothing really happened it was just regular americans expressing
[3:44:31.600 --> 3:44:37.440]  their right to protest and if you dare to oppose this and all of this talk of sitting in the
[3:44:37.440 --> 3:44:44.880]  national guard is clear evidence of tyranny and you know the fascism that is slowly gripping
[3:44:44.880 --> 3:44:51.920]  our entire country and if you don't support this you are a racist and you want innocent people to
[3:44:51.920 --> 3:44:57.600]  be murdered by police we don't have the luxury of being able to ignore reality here we have to
[3:44:58.240 --> 3:45:03.200]  face it as it comes and so we're bringing you everything that we hear and see up to date
[3:45:04.880 --> 3:45:09.840]  the capital the washington state capital building an olympia washington also has a large crowd
[3:45:09.840 --> 3:45:15.920]  gathered outside of it with people saying quote we go down swinging and again the media after having
[3:45:15.920 --> 3:45:22.480]  been after having ignored a year's worth of rioting after having downplayed the violence
[3:45:22.480 --> 3:45:26.640]  the destruction the chaos that has been wrought on the american people for the better part
[3:45:26.640 --> 3:45:33.120]  of a year as decent americans were shut down locked down imprisoned in their own homes and forced
[3:45:33.120 --> 3:45:40.240]  to shut down their businesses for the sake of covid-19 and we're told the riots were not riots
[3:45:40.240 --> 3:45:47.520]  they were protests the destruction wasn't destruction it was speech and now after less
[3:45:47.520 --> 3:45:54.160]  than two hours of pushback from the right they're calling it an insurrection they're calling in the
[3:45:54.160 --> 3:46:02.320]  national guard they're advocating for every one of the protesters to be shot and they are freaking
[3:46:02.320 --> 3:46:08.320]  out completely i guess this was to be expected now again we've had a bird's eye view of all of this
[3:46:08.320 --> 3:46:15.440]  and now they're saying from zero hedge explosive device found at r&c dnc has been evacuated
[3:46:18.160 --> 3:46:20.800]  i'm not sure where those exactly are if those are parts of the
[3:46:22.320 --> 3:46:27.040]  capital building or if those are nearby buildings
[3:46:28.960 --> 3:46:32.640]  at least one woman has been shot she's fighting for her life in critical condition
[3:46:32.640 --> 3:46:38.960]  the video of that firing which we played on air not too long ago has been expunged from twitter
[3:46:38.960 --> 3:46:43.680]  twitter has hidden the account that posted it and the video itself has been taken down
[3:46:45.280 --> 3:46:49.040]  we're saying a reporter is having a panic attack because they're locked in the capital without
[3:46:49.040 --> 3:46:53.520]  any police protection and we hear and feel rumblings underneath us this is scary folks
[3:46:53.520 --> 3:46:56.720]  especially after being labeled the enemy for some four years
[3:46:56.720 --> 3:47:09.840]  we'll keep bringing you updates here this is info wars.com we're going commercial free completely
[3:47:11.440 --> 3:47:16.160]  by the way more people posting and tagging me in these types of posts remember when dims were
[3:47:16.160 --> 3:47:22.320]  allowed to protest inside the rotunda then one of them cornered jeff flake in an elevator yeah good
[3:47:22.320 --> 3:47:34.240]  times right say our vote our turn hashtag our vote our turn more protesters breaking into congressional
[3:47:34.240 --> 3:47:45.920]  offices senatorial offices and uh destroying or taking information and hard drives that look like
[3:47:45.920 --> 3:47:52.800]  this um this video of the woman being shot is being re uploaded as far as i can tell it looks
[3:47:52.800 --> 3:47:59.680]  like she was shot through the door the it looks like it's shot through the uh through the window
[3:48:00.720 --> 3:48:06.800]  of that door my god ladies and gentlemen once again we have alex jones and owens shroyer are
[3:48:06.800 --> 3:48:12.480]  there on the scene they're they're getting themselves set up so we can get a solid uh
[3:48:12.480 --> 3:48:18.720]  stream from them and we can hear uh owens live right now and we have him uh
[3:48:18.720 --> 3:48:25.040]  all right ladies and gentlemen info wars is live on the scene sirens behind us uh flares have been
[3:48:25.040 --> 3:48:30.640]  shot in the air the capital has been greece a lady has been shot by capital police and uh i mean
[3:48:30.640 --> 3:48:35.120]  this is this is just history in the making and quite frankly this lady getting shot is only
[3:48:35.120 --> 3:48:39.920]  going to make people even matter because uh it's just going to show the double standard again
[3:48:39.920 --> 3:48:45.920]  and it's just going to show the double standard again that we have to witness so much here which is
[3:48:47.760 --> 3:48:52.480]  two billion dollars in property damage this summer no arrests no one held accountable
[3:48:52.480 --> 3:48:56.960]  oh but we go into the capital and the lady gets shot nobody will even know her name
[3:48:56.960 --> 3:49:02.240]  but if somebody overdoses on fentanyl in milwaukee it causes two billion dollars in property damage
[3:49:03.120 --> 3:49:06.560]  we're still getting intel people are still outside the capital this is a developing story
[3:49:06.560 --> 3:49:12.880]  in a developing situation a turning point perhaps in u.s history and in world history and i'm not
[3:49:12.880 --> 3:49:19.920]  even sure uh how to even describe this i think the images and the story look there's a communist
[3:49:19.920 --> 3:49:23.600]  chinese takeover with the new world order of the country they're trying to steal the election they're
[3:49:23.600 --> 3:49:27.120]  trying to bankrupt the nation they're telling us the country shouldn't even exist they're telling us
[3:49:27.120 --> 3:49:32.080]  the word mother and father can't exist this is a communist takeover and everybody knows it and so
[3:49:32.080 --> 3:49:36.880]  the america is starting to push back and zgp and everybody else seems to know you're the one starting
[3:49:36.880 --> 3:49:41.120]  all this not us and you're the ones that are going to pay just like etlar and just like all the rest
[3:49:41.120 --> 3:49:46.160]  of scumbags and and you know this is this is what happens this is the result this is like if you
[3:49:46.160 --> 3:49:50.480]  don't if you don't deal with a cancer and you have cancer and you don't deal with it until it's too
[3:49:50.480 --> 3:49:55.600]  late they basically only have one shot and that's just a chemotherapy radiate the hell out of you
[3:49:55.600 --> 3:50:00.080]  and then hope you can survive that's what we're going through we've had a cancer in this country
[3:50:00.080 --> 3:50:06.320]  for decades we've had a communist chinese takeover for decades we've been occupied by tyrants for
[3:50:06.320 --> 3:50:10.960]  decades and we've been ignoring it and that's why we've had a background at the show the last week
[3:50:10.960 --> 3:50:15.920]  of the capital red clouds going over it we should put that background up because there it is folks
[3:50:15.920 --> 3:50:20.000]  a foreign takeover of our country that was so powerful successful because it was freer than
[3:50:20.000 --> 3:50:24.880]  other nations the freedom is what makes us have money and be prosperous and now it's draining out
[3:50:24.880 --> 3:50:28.720]  it's like all the blue cities and all the blue states so more of our crew got here we got more
[3:50:28.720 --> 3:50:32.400]  of our better equipment we're going to recognize some of that before we start the fourth hour
[3:50:32.400 --> 3:50:36.320]  we're going to hand this back over to harrison smith but we'll be back co-hosting in the fourth
[3:50:36.320 --> 3:50:43.040]  hour to say great job the crew and war rooms coming up as well so we're going to be hosting all of
[3:50:43.040 --> 3:50:48.000]  that today and a lot more we're going to host right through the next hour right into the war
[3:50:48.000 --> 3:50:51.840]  room and so much more and remember we have to have our own communications to get this out
[3:50:51.840 --> 3:50:56.640]  they say they're going to march at six o'clock uh the the national guard and a bunch of police
[3:50:56.640 --> 3:51:01.040]  and they've already been throwing fat flashbangs and crowds to attack those peaceful patriots down
