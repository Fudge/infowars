[00:00.000 --> 00:26.000]  I'm not here to ruin the work of Jesus Christ.
[00:26.000 --> 00:46.000]  This is Savannah Hernandez for Action 7 News.
[00:46.000 --> 00:52.000]  I'm here in downtown Austin, Texas where behind me, Stephen Crowder is asking residents here
[00:52.000 --> 00:57.000]  if Black Lives Matter is a domestic terrorist organization or he's arguing his Change My
[00:57.000 --> 00:59.000]  Mind segment with locals here.
[00:59.000 --> 01:03.000]  Now as you guys can see behind me as well, there is quite a few people that live in Austin
[01:03.000 --> 01:04.000]  that I've already talked to.
[01:04.000 --> 01:07.000]  So I wanted to do my own man on the screen here and ask people what they've been thinking
[01:07.000 --> 01:11.000]  about the BLM protests that have ravaged our city and how city council...
[01:11.000 --> 01:25.000]  It's similar to Antifa being a terrorist organization, similar to the KKK being a terrorist organization.
[01:25.000 --> 01:26.000]  It's all racial.
[01:26.000 --> 01:28.000]  It's all one race fighting another race at the end of the day.
[01:28.000 --> 01:30.000]  There's two sides to every argument.
[01:30.000 --> 01:32.000]  I'm trying to understand you.
[01:32.000 --> 01:35.000]  I've seen and heard the things why Black Lives Matter.
[01:35.000 --> 01:41.000]  When I look at you, I look at him, look at her, look at him, look at him, I don't see male, female,
[01:41.000 --> 01:42.000]  Black Lives Matter.
[01:42.000 --> 01:43.000]  I see energy.
[01:43.000 --> 01:45.000]  It still is a valued point.
[01:45.000 --> 01:50.000]  But at the same time, with any good idea, there's always people who step in and corrupt it.
[01:50.000 --> 01:51.000]  I'm wearing a mask.
[01:51.000 --> 01:53.000]  Please wear a mask to protect those around you.
[01:53.000 --> 01:55.000]  It's not just about you.
[01:55.000 --> 01:57.000]  Matter of fact, it really isn't at all right now.
[01:57.000 --> 01:58.000]  So please wear a f***ing mask.
[01:58.000 --> 02:00.000]  Thank you for listening.
[02:00.000 --> 02:01.000]  First follow-up...
[02:01.000 --> 02:05.000]  Black Lives Matter!
[02:05.000 --> 02:06.000]  The Zippers line, damn it.
[02:06.000 --> 02:08.000]  You can't even cover your f***ing face.
[02:08.000 --> 02:10.000]  You're not coming out of here.
[02:10.000 --> 02:11.000]  Shut up!
[02:11.000 --> 02:14.000]  After that, I'm just going to shut up.
[02:14.000 --> 02:18.000]  Last night, people were both testing if any of them were insulated.
[02:18.000 --> 02:19.000]  I'm sorry.
[02:19.000 --> 02:21.000]  We're glad you tried to hear that.
[02:21.000 --> 02:25.000]  Tray my phone, my phone, my GCD and no more Phyllis D.
[02:25.000 --> 02:27.000]  I give them chance and chance and chance again.
[02:27.000 --> 02:29.000]  I even told many friends.
[02:29.000 --> 02:32.000]  Could you ask us to stop disrupting so we can keep having discussions?
[02:32.000 --> 02:33.000]  I think that's productive.
[02:33.000 --> 02:36.000]  The reason that I'm not going to is because this narrative is dangerous
[02:36.000 --> 02:39.000]  and this narrative got Garrett Foster murdered.
[02:39.000 --> 02:42.000]  You know what you're doing and if you don't, then you need to...
[02:42.000 --> 02:45.000]  The F***ing bastard said he did it.
[02:45.000 --> 02:46.000]  You weren't there.
[02:46.000 --> 02:47.000]  So you're not telling me what you're doing.
[02:47.000 --> 02:51.000]  The F***ing bastard said he did have an AK-47 and the guy was writing for Uber.
[02:51.000 --> 02:52.000]  So I'm sorry.
[02:52.000 --> 02:55.000]  I didn't have anything to do with Garrett Foster being killed.
[02:55.000 --> 02:56.000]  So I want to say this.
[02:56.000 --> 03:00.000]  Because of that, I think we might set up shop and I actually think that that's a valid self-defense,
[03:00.000 --> 03:01.000]  that shooting right there.
[03:01.000 --> 03:04.000]  If someone storms your car and you're being booted while you're in your car
[03:04.000 --> 03:06.000]  and someone comes up with an AK-47 aiming it in.
[03:06.000 --> 03:09.000]  A lot of my looms carry you down when they go on the side
[03:09.000 --> 03:12.000]  and stand in the mirror when they leave track of all the good guys.
[03:12.000 --> 03:13.000]  I give them a sign.
[03:13.000 --> 03:14.000]  I give them a sign.
[03:14.000 --> 03:15.000]  Just for you.
[03:15.000 --> 03:16.000]  I give them a sign.
[03:16.000 --> 03:17.000]  Just for you.
[03:20.000 --> 03:21.000]  Oh my gosh.
[03:21.000 --> 03:26.000]  I give them a sign.
[03:26.000 --> 03:52.000]  I give them a sign.
[03:52.000 --> 04:21.000]  I give them a sign.
[04:21.000 --> 04:47.000]  I give them a sign.
[04:47.000 --> 05:13.000]  I give them a sign.
[05:13.000 --> 05:39.000]  I give them a sign.
[05:39.000 --> 06:01.000]  I give them a sign.
[06:09.000 --> 06:38.000]  I give them a sign.
[06:38.000 --> 07:04.000]  I give them a sign.
[07:04.000 --> 07:31.000]  I give them a sign.
[07:31.000 --> 07:46.000]  I give them a sign.
[07:46.000 --> 07:58.000]  I give them a sign.
[07:58.000 --> 08:23.000]  I give them a sign.
[08:23.000 --> 08:49.000]  I give them a sign.
[08:49.000 --> 09:15.000]  I give them a sign.
[09:15.000 --> 09:41.000]  I give them a sign.
[09:41.000 --> 10:07.000]  I give them a sign.
[10:07.000 --> 10:33.000]  I give them a sign.
[10:33.000 --> 10:59.000]  I give them a sign.
[10:59.000 --> 11:25.000]  I give them a sign.
[11:25.000 --> 11:51.000]  I give them a sign.
[11:51.000 --> 12:17.000]  I give them a sign.
[12:17.000 --> 12:43.000]  I give them a sign.
[12:43.000 --> 13:12.000]  I give them a sign.
[13:12.000 --> 13:15.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're live.
[13:15.000 --> 13:17.000]  89 days out from the election.
[13:17.000 --> 13:21.000]  I'm your host Alex Jones, August 5th, 2020 on this Monday edition.
[13:21.000 --> 13:24.000]  And the name of the video that you just saw that's extremely powerful
[13:24.000 --> 13:31.000]  as opposed to the Band-Aid video is Why Is Big Tech So Afraid of This Report?
[13:31.000 --> 13:34.000]  It only has 123,000 views.
[13:34.000 --> 13:37.000]  It needs to have about 10 million views to save lives.
[13:37.000 --> 13:43.000]  By the way, it's very frustrating to see the public's unbelievable ignorance.
[13:43.000 --> 13:48.000]  I used to go out and do a little man on the street bit, like Jay walking,
[13:48.000 --> 13:52.000]  where I would give people the scientific name for salt.
[13:52.000 --> 13:57.000]  And I would say, don't we need to ban and then give the scientific name for salt.
[13:57.000 --> 14:02.000]  And almost everyone would say, yes, we need to ban it, including one guy had a chemistry degree.
[14:02.000 --> 14:05.000]  He said from Cornell, when I confronted him with that,
[14:05.000 --> 14:09.000]  and then Dan McAdoo did a similar report.
[14:09.000 --> 14:14.000]  You can also give out the scientific name for H2O.
[14:14.000 --> 14:16.000]  And it sounds very toxic.
[14:16.000 --> 14:19.000]  And most people will say that water needs to be banned.
[14:19.000 --> 14:25.000]  Of course, I didn't invent that it was Penn and Teller back in, like, 1999.
[14:25.000 --> 14:28.000]  I had a TV show that was on HBO.
[14:28.000 --> 14:30.000]  But boy, it was HBO different back then.
[14:30.000 --> 14:33.000]  And they went out and were debunking Man Made Global Warming.
[14:33.000 --> 14:35.000]  Well, if we're going to ban carbon dioxide, let's ban.
[14:35.000 --> 14:41.000]  And then they would give the scientific name for water.
[14:41.000 --> 14:45.000]  It's a dihydrogen monoxide.
[14:45.000 --> 14:46.000]  Sounds pretty scary.
[14:46.000 --> 14:48.000]  The scientific name of salt.
[14:48.000 --> 14:50.000]  I looked that up to you guys.
[14:50.000 --> 14:52.000]  Actually, print me off the scientific name for water and salt.
[14:52.000 --> 14:54.000]  I'm going to actually show that when we come back.
[14:54.000 --> 15:00.000]  OK, I am sweating like a pig because I was out on the Austin streets for a couple hours.
[15:00.000 --> 15:03.000]  Not to have it with Steven Crowder, and I just got back.
[15:03.000 --> 15:04.000]  I got on the show late.
[15:04.000 --> 15:05.000]  I apologize to the crew.
[15:05.000 --> 15:07.000]  Very stressful for them when I show up.
[15:07.000 --> 15:09.000]  Five minutes into the show already beginning.
[15:09.000 --> 15:12.000]  But we had important reports and promos to run.
[15:12.000 --> 15:15.000]  And so I've got all these articles to go over, all this huge news.
[15:15.000 --> 15:20.000]  But I was already thinking about just coming in here today and talking about solutions
[15:20.000 --> 15:22.000]  and what you think solutions are to where we are.
[15:22.000 --> 15:24.000]  What you think the globalists are going to pull next.
[15:24.000 --> 15:25.000]  And just take your phone calls.
[15:25.000 --> 15:26.000]  We're going to do that.
[15:26.000 --> 15:27.000]  We're going to take phone calls today.
[15:27.000 --> 15:28.000]  Open Line Wednesday.
[15:28.000 --> 15:31.000]  And we're going to take a ton of your calls.
[15:31.000 --> 15:35.000]  First-time callers, people that agree, people that disagree, long-time callers.
[15:35.000 --> 15:38.000]  Just stay free for all of calls.
[15:38.000 --> 15:46.000]  When we come back, I will give out that toll-free number for you to call in on this Wednesday
[15:46.000 --> 15:47.000]  transmission.
[15:47.000 --> 15:52.000]  And then we have all the other incredible news here where they're now Democrat cities are
[15:52.000 --> 15:53.000]  announcing in states.
[15:53.000 --> 15:54.000]  They're going to set up checkpoints.
[15:54.000 --> 15:59.000]  Make sure you follow the COVID rules and that's getting you ready for the forced inoculations.
[15:59.000 --> 16:07.000]  States cracking down on social gatherings says CNN because Fauci says if we don't, we'll
[16:07.000 --> 16:13.000]  see further surges in coronavirus positives because they're only ramping up the testing
[16:13.000 --> 16:19.000]  and because the tests have been designed at the Wuhan lab, it turns out, to be completely
[16:19.000 --> 16:20.000]  fraudulent.
[16:20.000 --> 16:26.000]  They cook the whole thing up offshore in a Communist dictatorship with Fauci, Bill Gates,
[16:26.000 --> 16:32.000]  and the Chai comms to be directed by the UN as a giant planetary power grab.
[16:32.000 --> 16:37.000]  And now it's all over the news that indeed Bill Gates has developed digital tattoos under
[16:37.000 --> 16:39.000]  your skin and so has Google.
[16:39.000 --> 16:44.000]  And they're deploying them at the airports next year where you'll have to have it to be
[16:44.000 --> 16:45.000]  able to travel.
[16:45.000 --> 16:48.000]  Oh, and then soon to leave your house or go in a grocery store.
[16:48.000 --> 16:52.000]  And the contact tracers work for Bill and Bill Gates and the Clintons and they're going
[16:52.000 --> 16:54.000]  to come to your house and make sure you're inoculated.
[16:54.000 --> 16:57.000]  Yes, we're now inside the mark of the beast.
[16:57.000 --> 16:58.000]  Resist to be enslaved.
[16:58.000 --> 17:02.000]  There are many reasons that the globalist launch this planetary lockdown.
[17:02.000 --> 17:06.000]  The number one reason is it serves every one of their purposes.
[17:06.000 --> 17:11.000]  We've gone over those purposes many times here on air.
[17:11.000 --> 17:16.000]  The cashless society, the surveillance system, global government, medical tyranny forced
[17:16.000 --> 17:17.000]  inoculation.
[17:17.000 --> 17:24.000]  But the most important facet is it teaches us that we are obsolete, that we are non-essential
[17:24.000 --> 17:31.000]  as we begin to witness automation computers and robots take over the jobs that people
[17:31.000 --> 17:33.000]  once had by design.
[17:33.000 --> 17:38.000]  This isn't like it's some advancement that we just fell into.
[17:38.000 --> 17:43.000]  It's been preplanned, organized globally and it's extremely predatory.
[17:43.000 --> 17:49.000]  And through governmental actuaries and tax programs and regulations, the central banks
[17:49.000 --> 17:55.000]  that control it all are able to pick the winners and the losers and consolidate power.
[17:55.000 --> 18:21.000]  This is the truest form of technocracy fascism.
[18:21.000 --> 18:25.000]  You called this an attack.
[18:25.000 --> 18:28.000]  Are you confident that this was an attack and not an accident?
[18:28.000 --> 18:33.000]  Well, it seemed like it, based on the explosion, I've met with some of our great generals and
[18:33.000 --> 18:35.000]  they just seemed to feel that it was.
[18:35.000 --> 18:43.000]  This was not some kind of a manufacturing explosion type of event.
[18:43.000 --> 18:48.000]  This seems to be, according to them, they would know better than I would, but they seemed
[18:48.000 --> 18:50.000]  to think it was an attack.
[18:50.000 --> 18:53.000]  It's a bomb of some kind, yes.
[18:53.000 --> 18:58.000]  Now, many times Trump comes out and tells you it's a bomb before the intelligence agencies
[18:58.000 --> 19:03.000]  come out and say it because he's allowed to declassify whatever he wants under the National
[19:03.000 --> 19:05.000]  Security Act of 1947.
[19:05.000 --> 19:09.000]  Just like the president can give people pardons, that's what we do.
[19:09.000 --> 19:14.000]  We the people elect someone who has an ace in the hole, an ace of spades card to play.
[19:14.000 --> 19:18.000]  And the left always acts like the president doesn't have that power.
[19:18.000 --> 19:21.000]  The president can do whatever he wants as long as we don't impeach him.
[19:21.000 --> 19:22.000]  It's up to us.
[19:22.000 --> 19:26.000]  And if we the people's Congress believes what he's done is wrong, and we can prove that
[19:26.000 --> 19:28.000]  it was bad, then he can be removed.
[19:28.000 --> 19:31.000]  But he's not above the law.
[19:31.000 --> 19:35.000]  He represents we the people and our law.
[19:35.000 --> 19:42.000]  Now, first they said fireworks, then they said no, it was a munitions facility.
[19:42.000 --> 19:46.000]  And we've had munitions facilities blow up in the United States before.
[19:46.000 --> 19:49.000]  Now, they've had a couple in Houston blow up.
[19:49.000 --> 19:53.000]  They had one time an ammonia nitrate ship blow up, a fertilizer, and it was 10 times
[19:53.000 --> 19:54.000]  better than this.
[19:54.000 --> 19:57.000]  I mean, it was a mushroom cloud at 50,000 feet.
[19:57.000 --> 20:01.000]  It just blew up dozens of square miles completely destroyed.
[20:01.000 --> 20:04.000]  So this stuff goes on.
[20:04.000 --> 20:07.000]  But in the Middle East, you know, there's a lot of terrorism that goes on.
[20:07.000 --> 20:15.000]  And Beirut's got a lot of Islamic slash Christian infighting going on there in Lebanon.
[20:15.000 --> 20:22.000]  Trump would not say that unless the military had intel that if terrorists are going to target
[20:22.000 --> 20:24.000]  something, that's what you want to target.
[20:24.000 --> 20:28.000]  You want to target an explosives or fireworks factory because then all you got to do is get
[20:28.000 --> 20:34.000]  a hanger need to go off inside close proximity to high explosives.
[20:34.000 --> 20:43.000]  It will cause a chain reaction on an atomic or hydrogen nuclear, thermonuclear, but one
[20:43.000 --> 20:46.000]  with TNT type effect.
[20:46.000 --> 20:48.000]  We've got overhead shots of this.
[20:48.000 --> 20:51.000]  You can see the port of your TV Bureau before.
[20:51.000 --> 20:55.000]  You can see after, looks like a giant asteroid hit it.
[20:55.000 --> 20:59.000]  But you notice those buildings still stood up to the blast.
[20:59.000 --> 21:04.000]  The Oklahoma City building had columns in the back blown out, but not in the front because
[21:04.000 --> 21:05.000]  there were bombs inside.
[21:05.000 --> 21:07.000]  The fuel truck was just a distraction.
[21:07.000 --> 21:10.000]  Continuing, now look at this headline.
[21:10.000 --> 21:15.000]  A country that depends on its imports to survive has officially lost its main seaport amid
[21:15.000 --> 21:18.000]  famine, COVID-19 and economic collapse.
[21:18.000 --> 21:22.000]  Well, it's not the economic collapse caused by COVID.
[21:22.000 --> 21:26.000]  It's an economic collapse and famine caused by the hysteria.
[21:26.000 --> 21:30.000]  But yeah, people are starving to death all over the world now.
[21:30.000 --> 21:34.000]  We wear our masks because we're heroes and keep the economy going.
[21:34.000 --> 21:39.000]  Beirut explosion leaves up to 200,000 homeless, similar to Hiroshima, says their governor.
[21:39.000 --> 21:43.000]  But notice, you never hear about the COVID-19 deaths in statistics.
[21:43.000 --> 21:46.000]  It's always, oh, this old lady died or this child died.
[21:46.000 --> 21:51.000]  Then you learn the child had a brain tumor and cancer and was on death's doorstep and
[21:51.000 --> 21:53.000]  they just test them and say they had COVID.
[21:53.000 --> 21:58.000]  They get the extra $53,000 or $52,000 that they get.
[21:58.000 --> 22:00.000]  And that's all come out, but they don't care.
[22:00.000 --> 22:04.000]  And the very cities that sent sick people into nursing homes to actually get some death
[22:04.000 --> 22:08.000]  numbers, it was over 40% until they stopped giving out the numbers down Michigan.
[22:08.000 --> 22:14.000]  Now, New York, now Pennsylvania, California, they're not releasing nursing home deaths.
[22:14.000 --> 22:15.000]  That's criminal.
[22:15.000 --> 22:19.000]  But that's what Venezuela does when they were up to 2,000 a week starving to death.
[22:19.000 --> 22:22.000]  They made it illegal to release death certificates.
[22:22.000 --> 22:24.000]  It was about five years ago.
[22:24.000 --> 22:27.000]  So that's just how the Commies do it, is they just don't give me the numbers anymore.
[22:27.000 --> 22:32.000]  Come like the media won't report on the 20-something people killed a day on the weekend in Chicago,
[22:32.000 --> 22:33.000]  black on black.
[22:33.000 --> 22:38.000]  And now, over the last two years, Trump isn't in control of the Justice Department.
[22:38.000 --> 22:42.000]  The Democrats are, they will not release the latest crime statistics on black on white crime.
[22:42.000 --> 22:45.000]  The oldest statistics are 10 to 1.
[22:45.000 --> 22:48.000]  The newer ones that have come out at city level are 12 to 1.
[22:48.000 --> 22:52.000]  Another thing is black folks, still most black people on average aren't racist out hunting
[22:52.000 --> 22:55.000]  white people, but there is a certain element of black people that have been encouraged
[22:55.000 --> 22:59.000]  by whites and others to go out and attack white people randomly.
[22:59.000 --> 23:01.000]  And you've seen that in the videos that are coming out.
[23:01.000 --> 23:06.000]  So people know what's going on and they know what happens to them when they get assaulted.
[23:06.000 --> 23:11.000]  And black people in black neighborhoods know that now the thugs just have free reign
[23:11.000 --> 23:14.000]  because the cops are slow rolling because they don't want to get put in prison.
[23:14.000 --> 23:16.000]  If God forbid, they do something.
[23:16.000 --> 23:19.000]  I mean, they called the police on George Floyd.
[23:19.000 --> 23:20.000]  Black people did.
[23:20.000 --> 23:24.000]  And he was obviously on meth and fentanyl, which was in a system.
[23:24.000 --> 23:27.000]  Enough fentanyl to kill two men his size.
[23:27.000 --> 23:32.000]  And he is horrified panic attacking.
[23:32.000 --> 23:35.000]  It's very frightening to see what people are like when they're mixing.
[23:35.000 --> 23:37.000]  I guess speedball is what they call it.
[23:37.000 --> 23:39.000]  And then those frightening dash cam still images.
[23:39.000 --> 23:42.000]  I watched the whole tape and he's like, I'm scared.
[23:42.000 --> 23:43.000]  Sit with me.
[23:43.000 --> 23:44.000]  I'm having claustrophobia.
[23:44.000 --> 23:48.000]  I can't breathe when he's outside, when he's inside the vehicle.
[23:48.000 --> 23:50.000]  Before he says, lay me down street.
[23:50.000 --> 23:52.000]  Then a crowd shows up to attack the cop.
[23:52.000 --> 23:56.000]  The cops not thinking normally putting your foot on one karate will make somebody pass out.
[23:56.000 --> 23:58.000]  It won't kill him generally.
[23:58.000 --> 24:02.000]  And then he just had a heart attack right there and died from all the drugs in his system.
[24:02.000 --> 24:04.000]  Those cops knew him.
[24:04.000 --> 24:06.000]  I've never seen police kiss somebody's ass like this.
[24:06.000 --> 24:08.000]  I mean, he was like, he was just a baby.
[24:08.000 --> 24:10.000]  They were, oh, I'll sit with you.
[24:10.000 --> 24:11.000]  Okay.
[24:11.000 --> 24:12.000]  Okay.
[24:12.000 --> 24:13.000]  All right.
[24:13.000 --> 24:14.000]  All right.
[24:14.000 --> 24:15.000]  It goes on and on and on and on.
[24:15.000 --> 24:18.000]  So let me tell you who killed him.
[24:18.000 --> 24:21.000]  The chai comms that shipped in that fentanyl.
[24:21.000 --> 24:24.000]  And I guess a dad not being at home when he was a little kid.
[24:24.000 --> 24:29.000]  And drug addiction and the people in the black owned shop.
[24:29.000 --> 24:35.000]  When he was in there causing trouble and passing fake hundred dollar bills.
[24:35.000 --> 24:36.000]  Why did it?
[24:36.000 --> 24:40.000]  It's like an antifilady was attacking some lady, some white lady, a white lady's attack on the white lady.
[24:40.000 --> 24:43.000]  And the white woman stabs her in the chest.
[24:43.000 --> 24:45.000]  And the woman goes, police, get over here and help me.
[24:45.000 --> 24:47.000]  You say, kill the police.
[24:47.000 --> 24:48.000]  You say, you don't want the police.
[24:48.000 --> 24:53.000]  And then as soon as somebody stabs your fat ass, as you're a physically attacking them,
[24:53.000 --> 24:54.000]  you don't know what to do.
[24:54.000 --> 24:58.000]  Hey, a little news flash to all you tough guy, antifuzz and all you thugs and criminals.
[24:58.000 --> 25:01.000]  Hard work and regular people are the folks that will kill you in a fight.
[25:01.000 --> 25:03.000]  Like this little business lady.
[25:03.000 --> 25:04.000]  Somebody's trying to assault her.
[25:04.000 --> 25:06.000]  She's going to kill you.
[25:06.000 --> 25:07.000]  She's not looking for trouble.
[25:07.000 --> 25:08.000]  She'll kill you.
[25:08.000 --> 25:13.000]  And that's what people are going to find out is, I mean, if I was that woman and more people are in my face,
[25:13.000 --> 25:15.000]  boom, I'll stab you too.
[25:15.000 --> 25:16.000]  And I'll teach my daughters.
[25:16.000 --> 25:17.000]  People are assaulting you.
[25:17.000 --> 25:19.000]  Stab them.
[25:19.000 --> 25:20.000]  Shoot them.
[25:20.000 --> 25:27.000]  I mean, this is not acceptable for people to thug out and attack whoever they want.
[25:27.000 --> 25:29.000]  And the woman's leaving me alone back off.
[25:29.000 --> 25:30.000]  And the other woman's trying to hit her.
[25:30.000 --> 25:33.000]  So she stabbed her in the chest.
[25:33.000 --> 25:34.000]  That woman's lucky.
[25:34.000 --> 25:37.000]  The woman didn't know what she was doing.
[25:37.000 --> 25:42.000]  So all you got to do with the knife folks is everything is speed.
[25:42.000 --> 25:43.000]  Everything is speed.
[25:43.000 --> 25:47.000]  Just like you can take a dowel and you're a kid, a little stick and cut other branches with it.
[25:47.000 --> 25:48.000]  It's how fast you're swinging.
[25:48.000 --> 25:51.000]  All you do is just right through those guts.
[25:51.000 --> 25:53.000]  And anybody out there is going to leave you alone.
[25:53.000 --> 25:57.000]  Their guts have got about a seven inch cut at them and the guts start coming out.
[25:57.000 --> 25:59.000]  They'll live, but they're going to leave you alone real quick.
[25:59.000 --> 26:04.000]  Now if you want to kill them, right in the carotid, just bam, you're dead.
[26:04.000 --> 26:05.000]  Bye-bye.
[26:05.000 --> 26:07.000]  You know, a lot of people like to shank people.
[26:07.000 --> 26:09.000]  Stab, stab, stab, stab, stab.
[26:09.000 --> 26:11.000]  And that's usually if you're assaulting somebody and they're on you.
[26:11.000 --> 26:12.000]  Yeah, that's what you do.
[26:12.000 --> 26:13.000]  They usually get off you pretty quick.
[26:13.000 --> 26:15.000]  I've been stabbed a couple of times.
[26:15.000 --> 26:16.000]  People have started it.
[26:16.000 --> 26:20.000]  But, you know, that's just how it works, ladies and gentlemen.
[26:20.000 --> 26:22.000]  And anyways, I'm digressing.
[26:22.000 --> 26:24.000]  Let me give the number out.
[26:24.000 --> 26:26.000]  877-789-2539.
[26:26.000 --> 26:28.000]  877-789-Alex.
[26:28.000 --> 26:30.000]  877-789-2539.
[26:30.000 --> 26:34.000]  And we'll get you up and on the air on this live Wednesday edition.
[26:34.000 --> 26:37.000]  877-789-2539.
[26:37.000 --> 26:39.000]  We've got a ton of news to cover.
[26:39.000 --> 26:44.000]  NYC imposed COVID checkpoints to enforce quarantine order.
[26:44.000 --> 26:50.000]  It's like they wouldn't let families see their parents and others in nursing homes.
[26:50.000 --> 26:53.000]  So they kill them quietly and get all that money.
[26:53.000 --> 26:55.000]  A bunch of dirty murder and criminals.
[26:55.000 --> 26:56.000]  We don't stand up to them.
[26:56.000 --> 26:57.000]  That makes us accomplices.
[26:57.000 --> 26:59.000]  The people are awakening.
[26:59.000 --> 27:02.000]  They're taking control of their own environment.
[27:02.000 --> 27:04.000]  Cell phones are an amazing tool.
[27:04.000 --> 27:06.000]  Really, they're a supercomputer that's handheld.
[27:06.000 --> 27:10.000]  But big tech, large corporations, hackers, governments, foreign governments,
[27:10.000 --> 27:15.000]  the CHICOMS especially, are using this to steal your data, to share your data,
[27:15.000 --> 27:19.000]  to be able to rig markets when they're able to scoop up billions of people's data
[27:19.000 --> 27:24.000]  that can actually predict on record what's going to happen in mass movements.
[27:24.000 --> 27:31.000]  Cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates their AI takeover.
[27:31.000 --> 27:32.000]  In their own words, they admit it.
[27:32.000 --> 27:37.000]  So I've been selling privacy pouches and pocket pockets and things like that for more than a decade.
[27:37.000 --> 27:39.000]  And now the units have gotten really lightweight.
[27:39.000 --> 27:40.000]  They're faraday cages.
[27:40.000 --> 27:42.000]  They just look like a cloth envelope.
[27:42.000 --> 27:44.000]  They work absolutely great.
[27:44.000 --> 27:49.000]  And it just gives you that security to have power over your data and power over your identity
[27:49.000 --> 27:52.000]  when you are traveling and don't want big brother to know what you're up to
[27:52.000 --> 27:53.000]  because it's not their business.

[28:57.000 --> 29:06.000]  Been on air in 26 years. Starting about 24 years ago, I began to get calls from major Hollywood directors, producers, actors.
[29:06.000 --> 29:09.000]  They wanted to meet with me and they said, what is your formal education?
[29:09.000 --> 29:12.000]  And I said, well really, nothing but a few years of college.
[29:12.000 --> 29:18.000]  Well, how are you one of the best science fiction or cultural writers we've ever heard?
[29:18.000 --> 29:22.000]  The stuff you come up with is just unbelievable.
[29:22.000 --> 29:26.000]  We'd like you to be in movies. We'd like you to write with us. We'd like you to do voiceovers.
[29:26.000 --> 29:31.000]  You're just a Renaissance man. Folks know I was in some movies and Harry Shearer made statements like that and a lot of others.
[29:31.000 --> 29:32.000]  I'm not bragging.
[29:32.000 --> 29:37.000]  I kept explaining to them. I said, do you understand I didn't come up with any of this?
[29:37.000 --> 29:44.000]  I'm reading globalist MIT white papers and futurist documents and they would just laugh at me and say, oh no way.
[29:44.000 --> 29:48.000]  Then I would give them the documents. They would get very, very scared.
[29:48.000 --> 29:52.000]  The next time I saw them in a few months would say, man, you're right. This is dystopic.
[29:52.000 --> 30:08.000]  Folks, I didn't make any of this up. Okay? It's real. It's real.
[30:23.000 --> 30:26.000]  Give me back my bullets.
[30:30.000 --> 30:32.000]  Give me back my bullets.
[30:32.000 --> 30:58.000]  Oh, the real civil war starts.
[31:02.000 --> 31:12.000]  All right, let's get into it.
[31:12.000 --> 31:26.000]  I was telling Steven Crowder just about an hour and a half ago or less that, hey, they have a city council proposal in the budget to blow up the police station with plastic explosives.
[31:26.000 --> 31:34.000]  And, you know, Crowder thought I was making it up and then I had a former Austin police officer, one of our security guys there, and he said, no, it's real.
[31:34.000 --> 31:37.000]  And we were pulling it up for him. He says, my God, this is insane.
[31:37.000 --> 31:46.000]  He scrolled down. There's the m4s.com article. It's got a copy of the proposed budget right there. You can't make this up, okay?
[31:46.000 --> 31:53.000]  Two city council members said maybe we shouldn't abolish all police so they went to their houses and basically threatened to kill them.
[31:53.000 --> 32:02.000]  Soros just got his top guy put in as the city attorney who says he's a communist and the police shouldn't even exist.
[32:02.000 --> 32:05.000]  I mean, that's on the news. Great faith.
[32:05.000 --> 32:08.000]  People go, well, Alex, I thought you got a problem with the police.
[32:08.000 --> 32:19.000]  I had a problem with Clinton and Bush had them being trained by the 80-year-old Southern Primary Law Center to say, we're getting ready for a war.
[32:19.000 --> 32:27.000]  The gun owners, and we're going to confiscate the guns and we need armored vehicles to fight the constitutional terrorist.
[32:27.000 --> 32:38.000]  Now, what happened was all that training, sitting the police down, and we've shown these manuals, we've shown video here countless times.
[32:38.000 --> 32:43.000]  He wrote the Mayak reports where they said, you know, Ron Paul's a terrorist and I'm a terrorist and Chuck Baldwin's a terrorist.
[32:43.000 --> 32:49.000]  Remember all those? Where they said the U.N. will take control of the police departments, strong cities.
[32:49.000 --> 32:53.000]  I mean, people used to hear me on the radio talking about this and they thought there's no way that's true.
[32:53.000 --> 32:55.000]  Now it's all over the news.
[32:55.000 --> 33:06.000]  And the U.N. says what treatments we can have for COVID-19 and the U.N. is in the news lecturing U.S. kids now about cigarettes and they're in the news lecturing about partying.
[33:06.000 --> 33:13.000]  Because the U.N. is like your daddy now. Oh, get dads out of the house, but you got the U.N.s, your daddy now.
[33:13.000 --> 33:19.000]  You just wake up the world government, but what am I getting out here?
[33:19.000 --> 33:24.000]  I'm going to go down to the city council and I'm serious.
[33:24.000 --> 33:31.000]  This week or next week, let's have a rally and let's call for the city council building to be blown up.
[33:31.000 --> 33:36.000]  That's crazy. Let me tell you, that city council is what's non-essential.
[33:36.000 --> 33:41.000]  That city council is run by the globalist. That city council, that building is just a building.
[33:41.000 --> 33:48.000]  But the left's always about blowing. I've seen some of the news about we need to blow up all old plantation houses.
[33:48.000 --> 33:52.000]  What the hell does that mean?
[33:52.000 --> 33:59.000]  I saw where the Deadpool actor was in the news going, eight years ago I got married and the Carolinas had an old plantation.
[33:59.000 --> 34:03.000]  I apologize.
[34:03.000 --> 34:09.000]  The same people don't own it that owned it 170 years ago, but it's all the virtues signaling.
[34:09.000 --> 34:14.000]  So they're saying we officially want to blow up the police department.
[34:14.000 --> 34:20.000]  Well, I want it put on the city council during citizens communications that they're all obsolete.
[34:20.000 --> 34:26.000]  They're all non-essential. And since they say we're obsolete and our businesses are non-essential and the police are non-essential,
[34:26.000 --> 34:34.000]  then I want these cops out of here. And when I'm done with my three minutes, oh, I'm sorry, they don't physically let you in the building anymore, do they?
[34:34.000 --> 34:38.000]  That's the lockdown. That's the new system where you can't get into government. They're separated from you.
[34:38.000 --> 34:44.000]  But imagine if I stayed there and ran up and grabbed the microphone and took over, they'd go, police arrest him.
[34:44.000 --> 34:49.000]  Oh, now the police are essential.
[34:49.000 --> 34:56.000]  So I think we really should call for Adler to be recalled. And I call for him to be thrown out of the W.
[34:56.000 --> 35:02.000]  He's up living on the top penthouse. And I call for the W to be boycotted until he's gone.
[35:02.000 --> 35:10.000]  And I call for people to start going in the W and making scenes in there every Friday and Saturday night
[35:10.000 --> 35:20.000]  until Adler has his ass thrown out of there because he's non-essential. He's an un-American, globalist, riding Shycombe Dingeling.
[35:20.000 --> 35:24.000]  Excuse me. And we show.
[35:24.000 --> 35:35.000]  So I've had enough, ladies and gentlemen. I've absolutely had enough.
[35:35.000 --> 35:44.000]  Imagine the arrogance of these people to tell us that police are non-essential everywhere so they can take the budget
[35:44.000 --> 35:50.000]  and give it to their commie groups and they admit in all these blue cities, oh, we're going to give money to Antifa
[35:50.000 --> 35:56.000]  to be overwatched for the city and we're going to give money to all our pals and all these groups like Ilhan Omar
[35:56.000 --> 36:03.000]  says we're going to abolish the Minneapolis police and then we're going to create a new group under her.
[36:03.000 --> 36:11.000]  Because that woman can't build a civilization because the minute she comes from pirate-slaver stock,
[36:11.000 --> 36:16.000]  most of African pirate-slavers, it's the Somalis that sold more black people than anybody else on earth,
[36:16.000 --> 36:23.000]  that particular tribe, why she's part white. But you notice they weren't just selling black slaves,
[36:23.000 --> 36:27.000]  they were grabbing people all over the Caribbean, all over the Mediterranean, excuse me.
[36:27.000 --> 36:33.000]  Later they brought them to the Caribbean, all over the Mediterranean. And so she's a ruler.
[36:33.000 --> 36:42.000]  She believes she has a right to rule you. She's better than you. You're cattle. You're slaves to her.
[36:42.000 --> 36:47.000]  And so as soon as she gets there, she then starts trying to take over.
[36:47.000 --> 36:52.000]  She didn't want to build anything. She wants to siphon off millions of dollars for multiple husbands
[36:52.000 --> 37:01.000]  and multiple campaign companies because she's a crook. It's what a pirate does. It's what a slaver does.
[37:01.000 --> 37:07.000]  You notice when they wore all that Koota Kenti stuff, they got on their knees.
[37:07.000 --> 37:15.000]  The senators picked that particular symbol of African royalty from that particular area of the east coast of northern Africa.
[37:15.000 --> 37:26.000]  And it was the actual ruling class that sold black slaves as far away as the Pacific Ocean,
[37:26.000 --> 37:33.000]  as far away as Indonesia, and then they would sell slaves for silk.
[37:33.000 --> 37:44.000]  And so the wealth of one of those woven silk scarves would be the equivalent of like $20 million that's estimated today in money.
[37:44.000 --> 37:54.000]  And so the very scarf they wear, that's why you can go to the Pacific Islands everywhere and they test people's blood.
[37:54.000 --> 38:06.000]  And it's a mix of Asians and Africans and some Caucasian because the Islamic slave traders, or at least 1400 years,
[38:06.000 --> 38:20.000]  they didn't really get going for about 200, sold white slaves, black slaves, and other slaves from the Mediterranean all over the Pacific Ocean.
[38:20.000 --> 38:27.000]  They didn't go as far as Hawaii. That's why you see the natives in Hawaii. They're not part African.
[38:27.000 --> 38:32.000]  But you go to other areas of the Pacific Ocean, I mean, you get off and there's islands of black people everywhere.
[38:32.000 --> 38:44.000]  Where the hell do you think they came from? They got loaded up by the Somalis and they got shipped over a thousand years ago.
[38:44.000 --> 38:48.000]  You know, some of the most interesting stuff I ever read, I got into it for about four years.
[38:48.000 --> 38:50.000]  I've been into a lot of different history back when I had time.
[38:50.000 --> 38:53.000]  About four years, I got into British naval histories.
[38:53.000 --> 38:57.000]  I read some French and Portuguese naval histories going back 500, 600 years too.
[38:57.000 --> 39:02.000]  And these were just letters translated into these volumes of books and it was describing.
[39:02.000 --> 39:10.000]  And I mean, you talk about captain's logs of like, there's this British ship and they come up on 10 pirate ships and there's the chief
[39:10.000 --> 39:15.000]  and he's like five feet tall and he's Asian and he's got all these giant Africans.
[39:15.000 --> 39:19.000]  He's bred with other Asians that are just humongous Samoans as big as the rock.
[39:19.000 --> 39:25.000]  And they get in this giant fight and the descriptions of it are just unbelievable.
[39:25.000 --> 39:29.000]  Like they'll run swords all the way through when the guys keep fighting.
[39:29.000 --> 39:35.000]  And it's like, oh, ordered to go into these waters filled with Arabic slave traders.
[39:35.000 --> 39:41.000]  We're sure to run into, you know, their African slave soldiers racing for the attack.
[39:41.000 --> 39:45.000]  And then it's just like, I mean, just like all these black slaves attacking.
[39:45.000 --> 39:49.000]  I mean, it's just like white people are the only people ever did this.
[39:49.000 --> 39:55.000]  Are you joking me? Ilhan Omar is a slave master. She loves it.

[43:55.000 --> 44:24.000]  Take action now and fund the info war.
[44:24.000 --> 44:44.000]  It's estimated by mainline historians that over a million Spanish were kidnapped over a 500 year period out of Spain, which was a Germanic stock.
[44:44.000 --> 45:00.000]  There was three kingdoms and taken to North Africa, trans shipped across land to Somalia and sold in the Pacific to the Pacific Islanders who had a slave culture.
[45:00.000 --> 45:06.000]  That's why you go to Pacific Islands, you'll have the royalty that are these little guys that run everything that are Asian.
[45:06.000 --> 45:11.000]  And then you've got all the warrior class that are bred with Asians and blacks.
[45:11.000 --> 45:20.000]  And I mean, this is the world, folks, and the public is so ignorant about what Samoans are or any of this.
[45:20.000 --> 45:26.000]  And so that was just warfare.
[45:26.000 --> 45:34.000]  And by the way, you called it slavery, not defending the institution, but I mean, you know, the warrior class was owned by the king, but they were proud of themselves and taken care of.
[45:34.000 --> 45:42.000]  But the Hessians in Prussia that didn't serve them didn't get abolished till the 1880s in Prussia.
[45:42.000 --> 45:50.000]  And the Hessian soldiers wore big blue uniforms and black fancy hessian boots, and they but they were owned by the king of Prussia.
[45:50.000 --> 46:03.000]  And a bunch of them got brought over here to fight us during the war for independence, but they got here and saw the freedom and saw the communities and for the first time ever, half of them ran off, half of them ran off.
[46:03.000 --> 46:18.000]  And that's why the US was not a big German population was mainly Dutch and British and Scottish and Irish until the colonies until the Germans came over here and ran off by the hundreds of thousands.
[46:18.000 --> 46:28.000]  They kept bringing them over and they were just instantly run off, which had never happened before because they'd always been in a caste system in Europe where you've got the royalty and then you do what you're told and you do this.
[46:28.000 --> 46:36.000]  They got here and people were like, the women, the men, everybody's like, hey, be with us. Come on, come on right now. It was like, yeah, I'm done.
[46:36.000 --> 46:45.000]  So again, this is the reality. Do German Americans who go back to the Hessians that came over here, do they have chips on their shoulders and oh, they were slaves in Germany or whatever?
[46:45.000 --> 46:54.000]  Or the Russians were serfs on the land? You were owned, you were on the land? No. Not a chip on the shoulder, but they teach you because you have slavery in your background.
[46:54.000 --> 47:01.000]  You're a bad person. What the hell does that even mean? Everyone in every culture had slavery, every place.
[47:01.000 --> 47:16.000]  Oh, you're trying to lessen the problems of it. No, I'm not. The globalists have slave camps in China today with people working harder than slaves ever worked up to 18 hours a day, forced abortions, living in containers, being forced drugged.
[47:16.000 --> 47:27.000]  China is more evil than anything anyone's ever thought of on a mass scale to their own people.
[47:27.000 --> 47:39.000]  And Nike and Apple are at the bloody trough lecturing us, an open free society about how we suck.
[47:39.000 --> 47:46.000]  It's an obscene joke. It's the Democrats in a lip lock with the chai comms. It's the Democrats literally selling us out of the chai comms.
[47:46.000 --> 47:54.000]  And then of course they're telling us we're all racist and we only need to kill each other and we need to have race riots because they've been caught selling us out to China and they're panicking.
[47:54.000 --> 48:02.000]  They were flooding us with fentanyl. They were flooding us with all the poisonous Chinese drugs that have been found to be tainted.
[48:02.000 --> 48:12.000]  They got caught and you wonder why Biden and all of them look like demonic crones because that's the type of garbage.
[48:12.000 --> 48:18.000]  That's the type of filth that would sell their own country out.
[48:18.000 --> 48:28.000]  And you sit there and you watch a bunch of basketball players taking care of better than any king ever was with tens of millions of dollars in their bank accounts and with everything.
[48:28.000 --> 48:35.000]  And they take a knee but they won't say a damn word about China because one manager says, yeah, China ought to let us have free speech.
[48:35.000 --> 48:39.000]  That manager gets in trouble.
[48:39.000 --> 48:46.000]  But then these people come out there and they kneel there in the anthem and talk smack about it because we're all supposed to hate our country.
[48:46.000 --> 48:54.000]  And it's literally the Chinese government funding it and all these people are schmucks, but it's not the basketball players are the problem.
[48:54.000 --> 49:04.000]  It's the cowardly scumbag owners of those teams who all just go along with the globalist agenda.
[49:04.000 --> 49:15.000]  I'm going to go to break, come back and I'm going to go to Craig, Jim, Brandon, Mike, Nicholas, Wilde, Joe, Carlos, John, David, many others on this Wednesday edition.
[49:15.000 --> 49:20.000]  But since I mentioned this earlier, let me hit this right now.
[49:20.000 --> 49:28.000]  I talked about hydrogen monoxide.
[49:28.000 --> 49:38.000]  Now, since 1983, they've had April Fool's Day edition of major publications come out and say we should ban hydrogen monoxide.
[49:38.000 --> 49:51.000]  The majority of people agree because it sounds scary like other dangerous toxic things like carbon monoxide that will kill you.
[49:51.000 --> 50:04.000]  That's how they've now listed other things that are just like water needed for life on this earth as evil is because the public is so fabulously ignorant.
[50:04.000 --> 50:12.000]  Carbon dioxide is one of the four building blocks of life, sunlight, water, oxygen, carbon dioxide.
[50:12.000 --> 50:22.000]  Carbon monoxide is totally different, but they have officially listed carbon dioxide that plants live off of as evil.
[50:22.000 --> 50:31.000]  That way they can say all carbon is bad and Bill Gates and others say we are going to lower the level of it down to zero.
[50:31.000 --> 50:38.000]  And the whole planet would be dedicated to that. And that's how alien and sick and crazy this is.
[50:38.000 --> 50:48.000]  So here it is. Hydrogen monoxide is the water molecule. Oxygen, hydrogen, and hydrogen.
[50:48.000 --> 50:54.000]  But the majority of people in interviews we've done, pen and teller have done, newspapers done polls,
[50:54.000 --> 51:05.000]  when they say for the earth we demand hydrogen monoxide and it happens. It's just like on average cops kill 14 innocent black men a year.
[51:05.000 --> 51:16.000]  The average person thinks there's an epidemic of cops killing black people. It's extremely rare and police are twice as likely per capita to kill whites and blacks.
[51:16.000 --> 51:21.000]  And that's because they're not scared to carry out their duty and they still make mistakes, but it's just crazy.
[51:21.000 --> 51:25.000]  So what is the scientific name of water? Dihydrogen monoxide.
[51:25.000 --> 51:29.000]  I guarantee you talk to your friends and family, you go, we demand hydrogen monoxide for the earth.
[51:29.000 --> 51:32.000]  They'll say, yep, I'm a virtue second order. Let's do it.
[51:32.000 --> 51:39.000]  You also tell people, man, sodium chloride is really causing a problem. We need to do something about it.
[51:39.000 --> 51:44.000]  That's table salt.
[51:44.000 --> 52:03.000]  Now you laugh at that, but that's not funny because they're banding carbon dioxide folks just like they can tell you that the hydrogen monoxide is bad.
[52:03.000 --> 52:06.000]  So that's the real deficit we have here with reality.
[52:06.000 --> 52:09.000]  Okay, let me just say this and we're going to bring them back.
[52:09.000 --> 52:18.000]  I've got a lot more. I've got some huge news on the explosion and what Trump had to say and we'll cover that at six after and then we'll go right to your calls.
[52:18.000 --> 52:25.000]  Major power came out and said that they believe the Iranians are running that facility.
[52:25.000 --> 52:29.000]  That major power has a history of blowing up weapons depots in the Middle East.
[52:29.000 --> 52:33.000]  It looks like what Trump said is right again. That is coming up next hour.
[52:33.000 --> 52:37.000]  But first off, we fund this operation because you buy products from us.
[52:37.000 --> 52:46.000]  We've got the best air filtration, four-stage ion filter that's $200, $300 less than the exact same filter from other companies who just put a three times, four times markup on it.
[52:46.000 --> 52:49.000]  They are selling those at cost only for another week.
[52:49.000 --> 52:54.000]  Lexapur Breeze available for just $149. It's unbelievable to get at that cost.
[52:54.000 --> 53:02.000]  Also, we don't have store-wide free shipping anymore because we're bringing in a bunch of money, but none of it is there to actually fund the operation.
[53:02.000 --> 53:08.000]  Of course, we're selling a lot of product at those prices, but there's no money to actually fund things, so there's no real extra cash there.
[53:08.000 --> 53:17.000]  So you can still get 50% to 60% off of the best-selling products, double-patriot points in your next order, and these specials will have to end very, very soon.
[53:17.000 --> 53:22.000]  It's the Reopen America back-to-school special.
[53:22.000 --> 53:33.000]  60% off, 50% off, all our best-sellers, double-patriot points, bodies, Living Defense, Vazelbeats, Faribault Force, Vita Mineral Fusion, Rain Force Plus, and those are all selling out, so we've got to stop that soon.
[53:33.000 --> 53:41.000]  Survival Shield X2, Survival Shield X3, Lung Cleanse, Ultra 12, DNA Force Plus, these are all just game changers, folks.
[53:41.000 --> 53:46.000]  Winter Sun Plus, so that's so good for your immunity with the purest, best-vitamin D3 and vitamin K for better absorption.
[53:46.000 --> 53:57.000]  Chill Force, 50% off, Superfumal Vitality, 50% off, Hydrogen Selenium, 50% off, they send away 50% off, and depending on your physiology and your metabolic system and what you might be deficient in,
[53:57.000 --> 54:06.000]  you should try all of these because it'll see what's better for you because you can go take some synthetic multivitamin that you don't even absorb, and it can actually be bad for your liver.
[54:06.000 --> 54:14.000]  This stuff's all organic, this stuff's all pure. I mean, like, our selenium is from the mustard seed, pure concentrate, the strongest one out there.
[54:14.000 --> 54:20.000]  But you need to be careful when you take it because it'll give you so much energy, at least it does me, that it's just insane.
[54:20.000 --> 54:27.000]  Same thing with X2 or X3, just so many of us are deficient in that key compound, that essential compound, that essential element.
[54:27.000 --> 54:32.000]  I'd either, when you finally get it at the atomic level, it's just such a game changer, it could be a little crazy.
[54:32.000 --> 54:39.000]  But just take advantage of all that, infowarstore.com, while you still can, and again, I would just say, with all the craziness going on,
[54:39.000 --> 54:44.000]  they're scourable food, they're shipping within two to four weeks now, they have it in stock, it's the highest quality, infowarstore.com.
[54:44.000 --> 55:10.000]  But right back, stay with us.
[55:10.000 --> 55:19.000]  It's absolutely out of control, but people now understand that evil was always real, it is spiritual, and it was just waiting to make its move,
[55:19.000 --> 55:22.000]  building beneath the surface, and now it's emerged.
[55:22.000 --> 55:30.000]  That's why when I ask listeners and viewers for your prayer, I mean it, I'm praying for America, I'm praying for you, and I know the power of prayer is real, and God hears it.
[55:30.000 --> 55:37.000]  We need to come together and pray for an even greater awakening, pray for Donald Trump to be protected, pray for him to win a landslide,
[55:37.000 --> 55:43.000]  and pray for the people under deception of the globalist to awaken and join us in liberty and freedom.
[55:43.000 --> 55:47.000]  God bless you all, please pray for him for us as well.
[55:47.000 --> 55:58.000]  Americans have had freedom for so long, and most Americans were born into such docile times compared to the rest of history, that we really have a blind spot for tyranny.
[55:58.000 --> 56:08.000]  We don't appreciate the American way, truth, justice, due process, the right to self-defense, private property, because we've had it so long, and we just think that's how the rest of the world is.
[56:08.000 --> 56:18.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, the Renaissance, the social contract that's 500 years old to try to build up humanity, and try to believe in humanity, and to try to empower the weak as well as the strong,
[56:18.000 --> 56:22.000]  is something the West invented, and that's what made our modern world.
[56:22.000 --> 56:30.000]  That's now been hijacked by the technocrats, by the globalists, who say humans are ugly and bad for the earth, and we need to be cold and dumbed down,
[56:30.000 --> 56:37.000]  and put into subgroups that the elites dominate, manipulate, and command, even if we're even lucky enough to stay alive.
[56:37.000 --> 56:45.000]  And that's what COVID-19 is, a global UN revolution against free humanity, against your family, against prosperity, and against your future.
[56:45.000 --> 56:48.000]  If you don't stand up and fight, you deserve what you get.
[56:48.000 --> 56:53.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[56:59.000 --> 57:07.000]  Coming up, your phone calls, and Benjamin Netanyahu talking about the explosion, talking about that facility.
[57:07.000 --> 57:11.000]  Sometimes the news clips just speak for themselves. Here's Biden.
[57:11.000 --> 57:20.000]  President, your opponent in this election, President Trump has made your mental state a campaign topic.
[57:20.000 --> 57:32.000]  And when asked in June, if you've been tested for cognitive decline, you've responded that you're constantly tested in effect because you're in situations like this on the campaign trail.
[57:32.000 --> 57:36.000]  But please clarify, specifically, have you taken a cognitive test?
[57:36.000 --> 57:38.000]  No, I haven't taken a test.
[57:38.000 --> 57:41.000]  Why the hell would I take a test?
[57:41.000 --> 57:47.000]  Come on, man. That's like saying you, before you got in this program, you take a test where you're taking cocaine or not.
[57:47.000 --> 57:49.000]  What do you think, huh?
[57:49.000 --> 57:59.000]  What do you say to President Trump who brags about his test and makes your mental state an issue for voters?
[57:59.000 --> 58:05.000]  Well, if he can't figure out the difference between an elephant and a lion, I don't know what the hell he's talking about.
[58:05.000 --> 58:18.000]  Did you watch that? Look, come on, man. I know you're trying to goad me, but I mean, I'm so forward looking to have an opportunity to sit with the president or stand with the president in debates.
[58:18.000 --> 58:20.000]  There are going to be plenty of time.
[58:20.000 --> 58:21.000]  But all of a sudden it's going to.
[58:21.000 --> 58:27.000]  And by the way, as I joke with him, you know, I shouldn't say it. I'm going to say something I probably shouldn't say.
[58:27.000 --> 58:43.000]  But anyway, I am, I am very willing to let the American public judge my physical mental field, my physical as well as my mental fitness and to, you know, to make a judgment about who I am.
[58:43.000 --> 58:47.000]  The entertainment value of watching these people crash and burn is delicious.
[58:47.000 --> 58:51.000]  Off of my porch.
[58:51.000 --> 58:58.000]  Developing today, the husband of L.A. County, D.A. Jackie Lacey is facing charges following this March 2nd incident.
[58:58.000 --> 59:06.000]  Black Lives Matter protesters knocked on the door and David Lacey answered it while waving the gun through California Attorney General's office.
[59:06.000 --> 59:09.000]  He's in charge of the case due to the conflict of interest.
[59:09.000 --> 59:12.000]  He's been charged with three counts of assault with a firearm.
[59:12.000 --> 59:19.000]  Jackie Lacey later apologized saying that her husband was acting out of fear after she had received death threats.
[59:19.000 --> 59:23.000]  When people first started talking about diversity, I was a little apprehensive.
[59:23.000 --> 59:28.000]  But when I realized it just meant hiring a bunch of different colors of people who agree with me, I was all in.
[59:28.000 --> 59:31.000]  Every job should be 50% women.
[59:31.000 --> 59:32.000]  I don't know if every job...
[59:32.000 --> 59:34.000]  Do you have one with diversity, Osama?
[59:34.000 --> 59:35.000]  No, I'm just saying that...
[59:35.000 --> 59:37.000]  Anyone else here have a problem with diversity?
[59:37.000 --> 59:40.000]  There's no biological difference between men and women.
[59:40.000 --> 59:42.000]  Very diverse guys, great work.
[59:42.000 --> 59:48.000]  I pledge to fill every position other than mine with the most diverse staff of people who agree with me in the history of Silicon Valley.
[59:48.000 --> 59:50.000]  The attack needs to censor speech more.
[59:50.000 --> 59:52.000]  I'll just tweet another picture of the stuff.
[59:52.000 --> 59:53.000]  Actually, let me get in the middle of this puppy.
[59:53.000 --> 59:55.000]  Kamma 3 say I'm with her.
[59:55.000 --> 1:00:01.000]  We have black guys that hate Trump, brown guys that hate Trump, Asians that hate Trump, women that hate Trump, LGBT who hate Trump.
[1:00:01.000 --> 1:00:06.000]  Our main export at Diversity Corp is the right opinions, but said by a black guy.
[1:00:06.000 --> 1:00:07.000]  Russia Gate.
[1:00:07.000 --> 1:00:09.000]  Yeah, just do the other one too, if you don't mind.
[1:00:09.000 --> 1:00:11.000]  Scientists should never be questioned.
[1:00:11.000 --> 1:00:13.000]  Didn't you ask for a resume?
[1:00:13.000 --> 1:00:15.000]  You asked for my 23 and me and my clothes on Trump.
[1:00:15.000 --> 1:00:18.000]  My interview was just him asking me if I had ever had sex with a woman.
[1:00:18.000 --> 1:00:20.000]  Hey, what does the plus stand for an LGBT?
[1:00:20.000 --> 1:00:22.000]  You think we get like a plus that hates Trump?
[1:00:22.000 --> 1:00:24.000]  I was like, yeah, I made out with a chick once in college.
[1:00:24.000 --> 1:00:26.000]  And then he said, okay, that's good enough.
[1:00:26.000 --> 1:00:31.000]  Okay, Twitter just hired four new chick coders and I'm thinking we need to up the heat with a new slogan. Any ideas?
[1:00:31.000 --> 1:00:35.000]  Uh, what about, we don't make anything, but we are multicultural doing it.
[1:00:35.000 --> 1:00:37.000]  Cold that wasn't written by the white devil.
[1:00:37.000 --> 1:00:39.000]  Uh, Lesbo, you have any ideas?
[1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:41.000]  Uh, no, I wouldn't really classify myself as gay.
[1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:44.000]  Can you take pride in our work?
[1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:46.000]  Hey, can we get a Colombian coder?
[1:00:46.000 --> 1:00:53.000]  You know, I make it look easy, but it takes a lot of effort to put together a broad group of people with the exact same stance on every social and political issue.
[1:00:53.000 --> 1:00:55.000]  Beauty is a social construct.
[1:00:55.000 --> 1:00:57.000]  Not sure what we do here, to be honest.
[1:00:57.000 --> 1:00:59.000]  Mainly brag about diversity on social media.
[1:00:59.000 --> 1:01:01.000]  The only thing I like about you two is how different you are.
[1:01:01.000 --> 1:01:03.000]  We're actually pretty similar, man.
[1:01:03.000 --> 1:01:07.000]  Every morning he gives us a list of what he calls the right opinions.
[1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:10.000]  Revealing that neutrality will end the world.
[1:01:10.000 --> 1:01:12.000]  I'm pretty sure they did repeal that.
[1:01:12.000 --> 1:01:14.000]  Diversity is our strength.
[1:01:17.000 --> 1:01:19.000]  Mary, have a seat, please.
[1:01:19.000 --> 1:01:22.000]  What's this I hear about you liking an Andrew Dice clay tweet?
[1:01:22.000 --> 1:01:24.000]  Yes, my favorite comedian.
[1:01:24.000 --> 1:01:25.000]  You're fired.
[1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:28.000]  On Lebanon, you called this an attack.
[1:01:28.000 --> 1:01:32.000]  Uh, are you confident that this was an attack and not an accident?
[1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:39.000]  Well, it seemed like it, based on the explosion, I met with some of our great generals and they just seemed to feel that it was.
[1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:47.000]  This was not a, uh, some kind of a, uh, manufacturing, uh, explosion type of event.
[1:01:47.000 --> 1:01:54.000]  This was a, uh, seems to be, according to them, they would know better than I would, but they seemed to think it was a, uh, attack.
[1:01:54.000 --> 1:01:55.000]  It was.
[1:01:55.000 --> 1:02:01.000]  A lot of you are probably already very familiar with these terms about to introduce, but some folks aren't.
[1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:03.000]  So, for those that aren't, here they are.
[1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:05.000]  Activated charcoal.
[1:02:05.000 --> 1:02:09.000]  And then another term, enamel safe.
[1:02:09.000 --> 1:02:16.000]  Activated charcoal is the fastest growing type of toothpaste for a good reason.
[1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:17.000]  It really, really works.
[1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:32.000]  Well, we've come up with the best activated charcoal toothpaste with no fillers, the cleanest type, the highest quality, with a bunch of high quality and central oils and other ingredients known and documented to do amazing things for your oral hygiene and your overall health in your mouth.
[1:02:32.000 --> 1:02:37.000]  It's so critical and it makes your teeth look really white and really, really clean and it's good for your gums.
[1:02:37.000 --> 1:02:42.000]  But on top of that, it doesn't have any ingredients that are known to hurt enamel.
[1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:47.000]  I've gone out before and gotten toothpaste that really made my teeth clean, but eroded enamel up the top.
[1:02:47.000 --> 1:02:52.000]  So I got into really safe, healthy types of toothpaste and that's what this is.
[1:02:52.000 --> 1:03:20.000]  It's available at infowarstore.com.
[1:03:20.000 --> 1:03:23.000]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, into hour number two.
[1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:27.000]  We're going to go to every caller that is on the board.
[1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:32.000]  David and John and Carlos and Joe and Wilde and Nicholas and Mike and Brandon and Jim and Craig.
[1:03:32.000 --> 1:03:35.000]  I am Alex Jones, your host.
[1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:43.000]  And while the news is insane, we'll be covering a lot of it, but I'm going to go to your phone call series the second, but this is not broken in the news yet.
[1:03:43.000 --> 1:03:50.000]  I've asked some of the intrepid writers at infowarstore.com and newswarstore.com to put this out.
[1:03:50.000 --> 1:04:06.000]  Turns out in 2018, the ongoing prime minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, talked about Iran and Hezbollah building missiles at a factory in Beirut
[1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:16.000]  and supplying Hezbollah with the missiles hitting Israel and they went on to say that they were going to destroy the ambitious project,
[1:04:16.000 --> 1:04:20.000]  warning the enemies to be careful.
[1:04:20.000 --> 1:04:22.000]  Now, that's ABC News.
[1:04:22.000 --> 1:04:31.000]  We've got the media making fun of Trump for saying he talked to the generals and they said it looks like somebody targeted and blew it up.
[1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:35.000]  Well, they had the satellites, folks, and guaranteed that was being looked at at the time.
[1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:41.000]  And so they they can see the signature and I'm sure had intel.
[1:04:41.000 --> 1:04:44.000]  And so Trump knows that they're going to say, oh, Trump's full of it later.
[1:04:44.000 --> 1:04:46.000]  It'll come out that Israel probably blew it up.
[1:04:46.000 --> 1:04:50.000]  There were a bunch of explosions a few weeks ago when I ran at weapons facilities.
[1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:57.000]  Remember Netanyahu also showed it at the UN and talked about it.
[1:04:57.000 --> 1:05:03.000]  So when Trump says looks like somebody blew this up, the generals tell me he didn't just say in that unless they told him that.
[1:05:03.000 --> 1:05:08.000]  But let's go ahead and hear from Benjamin Netanyahu two years ago.
[1:05:08.000 --> 1:05:11.000]  Hezbollah.
[1:05:11.000 --> 1:05:13.000]  Listen to this.
[1:05:13.000 --> 1:05:22.000]  Hezbollah is deliberately using the innocent people of Beirut as human shields.
[1:05:22.000 --> 1:05:36.000]  They've placed three of these missile conversion sites along Beirut's International Airport.
[1:05:36.000 --> 1:05:42.000]  Here's a picture that's worth a thousand missiles.
[1:05:42.000 --> 1:05:47.000]  Here's Beirut's International Airport.
[1:05:47.000 --> 1:05:49.000]  Here's the first missile site.
[1:05:49.000 --> 1:05:57.000]  It's in the Uzzi neighborhood on the water's edge a few blocks away from the runway.
[1:05:57.000 --> 1:05:59.000]  Here's the second site.
[1:05:59.000 --> 1:06:01.000]  It's underneath a soccer stadium.
[1:06:01.000 --> 1:06:03.000]  That's the soccer stadium.
[1:06:03.000 --> 1:06:06.000]  Two blocks away.
[1:06:06.000 --> 1:06:09.000]  And here's the third site.
[1:06:09.000 --> 1:06:17.000]  It's adjacent to the airport itself right next to it.
[1:06:17.000 --> 1:06:26.000]  Okay, so I would look at Israel as being who's behind us.
[1:06:26.000 --> 1:06:28.000]  And of course no one is saying that.
[1:06:28.000 --> 1:06:32.000]  No one is talking about that because Israel is so politicized.
[1:06:32.000 --> 1:06:35.000]  Whether you're for Israel or against Israel or neutral in Israel.
[1:06:35.000 --> 1:06:42.000]  Israel has a long history of blowing up nuclear reactors, weapons sites, conventional bomb sites in the Middle East,
[1:06:42.000 --> 1:06:48.000]  whether it be in Iran, whether it be in Iraq, whether it be in Lebanon, whether it be in Syria, whether it be in Egypt.
[1:06:48.000 --> 1:06:52.000]  And so I think it's fair to say, yeah, let's roll that again when it first explodes.
[1:06:52.000 --> 1:06:58.000]  That huge shockwave that Israel probably did a missile or had somebody put a bomb in there.
[1:06:58.000 --> 1:07:00.000]  And you see the first explosion go off.
[1:07:00.000 --> 1:07:02.000]  It looks like a nuclear explosion.
[1:07:02.000 --> 1:07:10.000]  And then once it causes a chain reaction with all of the explosives inside that facility, you can see it setting off.
[1:07:10.000 --> 1:07:12.000]  Whatever it hits, it hits some smaller munitions at first.
[1:07:12.000 --> 1:07:14.000]  They start popping off.
[1:07:14.000 --> 1:07:23.000]  And then, boom, chain reaction, maybe it hit the actual plastic explosives locker where they're taking the raw explosive and putting it into the missiles.
[1:07:23.000 --> 1:07:29.000]  And it's major.
[1:07:29.000 --> 1:07:30.000]  And they say that was what?
[1:07:30.000 --> 1:07:33.000]  A thousand times bigger than the West Texas.
[1:07:33.000 --> 1:07:40.000]  It wasn't in West Texas, it was West fertilizer company up by Wakeup, north of Wakeup.
[1:07:40.000 --> 1:07:44.000]  And that thing killed a whole bunch of people and devastated things for miles around.
[1:07:44.000 --> 1:07:51.000]  Imagine 1,000 times more powerful.
[1:07:51.000 --> 1:07:58.000]  So, headline, Israel's fingerprints all over Beirut explosion.
[1:07:58.000 --> 1:08:06.000]  Or Benjamin Netanyahu threatened to bomb Beirut missile site in 2018.
[1:08:06.000 --> 1:08:07.000]  Because he goes on.
[1:08:07.000 --> 1:08:09.000]  I remember Aaron, that speech that you anyway.
[1:08:09.000 --> 1:08:11.000]  And he said, it's in the news.
[1:08:11.000 --> 1:08:14.000]  He said, I'm warning you, you better stop.
[1:08:14.000 --> 1:08:16.000]  Well, two years later, it's been hit.
[1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:19.000]  And it's not even in the media that he did that.
[1:08:19.000 --> 1:08:21.000]  Listeners send us emails.
[1:08:21.000 --> 1:08:23.000]  Rob Duke goes to the emails all day long.
[1:08:23.000 --> 1:08:25.000]  And the listener pointed that out.
[1:08:25.000 --> 1:08:27.000]  So I'm glad we got a tip.
[1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:29.000]  I keep sending those to showtipsinforewords.com.
[1:08:29.000 --> 1:08:30.000]  So here you go.
[1:08:30.000 --> 1:08:32.000]  Okay, I'm done for now.
[1:08:32.000 --> 1:08:37.000]  It just went viral.
[1:08:37.000 --> 1:08:38.000]  Let's go ahead.
[1:08:38.000 --> 1:08:41.000]  That article is going up on infowars.com.
[1:08:41.000 --> 1:08:44.000]  Very, very soon.
[1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:52.000]  Netanyahu threatened to target weapons site in 2018.
[1:08:52.000 --> 1:08:54.000]  I guess the article is out now.
[1:08:54.000 --> 1:08:56.000]  That's not the headline I gave, but whatever I give up.
[1:08:56.000 --> 1:09:00.000]  Netanyahu warned of Hezbollah missile site in Beirut warehouse.
[1:09:00.000 --> 1:09:05.000]  2018 footage of Israeli Prime Minister services that for tragedy.
[1:09:05.000 --> 1:09:09.000]  I mean, Netanyahu threatened, you can read the articles.
[1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:12.000]  There's transcripts threatened to attack it.
[1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:14.000]  But it's okay.
[1:09:14.000 --> 1:09:16.000]  You know, we have articles that I love the crew.
[1:09:16.000 --> 1:09:17.000]  They're great.
[1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:19.000]  But it's kind of like evident.
[1:09:19.000 --> 1:09:23.000]  It seems.
[1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:26.000]  It seems that they're counting flu deaths as COVID deaths.
[1:09:26.000 --> 1:09:29.000]  No, they officially admit they are six months ago.
[1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:31.000]  And it's in all the wraps.
[1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:32.000]  And I see headlines.
[1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:35.000]  We always think, oh, it seems we want to be journalists.
[1:09:35.000 --> 1:09:37.000]  We always want to not be sure.
[1:09:37.000 --> 1:09:43.000]  It seems that sick people were sent into nursing homes against regulations
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:44.000]  and it killed them.
[1:09:44.000 --> 1:09:45.000]  No, no, no, they did.
[1:09:45.000 --> 1:09:46.000]  It happened.
[1:09:46.000 --> 1:09:48.000]  It happened.
[1:09:48.000 --> 1:09:49.000]  Yeah, there it is.
[1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:51.000]  Fox News.
[1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:53.000]  It's nothing against the crew.
[1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:54.000]  I'm just going to do everything on air now.
[1:09:54.000 --> 1:09:55.000]  All communication this way.
[1:09:55.000 --> 1:10:04.000]  Because, you know, I see headlines out there, like, not just from us, like,
[1:10:04.000 --> 1:10:10.000]  you know, Epstein claimed he founded, helped found the Clinton Foundation.
[1:10:10.000 --> 1:10:14.000]  He was on record doing it.
[1:10:14.000 --> 1:10:20.000]  You know, some claim Bill Gates was saying,
[1:10:20.000 --> 1:10:22.000]  you know, he's photographed, he's on record doing it.
[1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:24.000]  They were in business together.
[1:10:24.000 --> 1:10:28.000]  And so all I'm saying is, the globalists keep us in this position
[1:10:28.000 --> 1:10:31.000]  where we're always like, you know, there's a world government.
[1:10:31.000 --> 1:10:33.000]  Well, we say there's not.
[1:10:33.000 --> 1:10:35.000]  Do what the world government says.
[1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:38.000]  And we're always just, like, arguing with them if the world government exists or not.
[1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:41.000]  Or arguing them if convicted pedophiles are running drag queen story time
[1:10:41.000 --> 1:10:44.000]  where it's all on record and we never get to, hey, you're lying.
[1:10:44.000 --> 1:10:45.000]  We know what you're doing.
[1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:48.000]  You're in trouble.
[1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:50.000]  You know, the left says abolish the police department.
[1:10:50.000 --> 1:10:52.000]  How about we abolish their leftist programs?
[1:10:52.000 --> 1:10:57.000]  How about we abolish their agencies, their groups that have destroyed society?
[1:10:57.000 --> 1:10:59.000]  How about we cut off all their funding for the homeless
[1:10:59.000 --> 1:11:03.000]  that just pays them to be on drugs and lay around all day?
[1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:04.000]  How about we set the narrative?
[1:11:04.000 --> 1:11:10.000]  How about we go on the offensive?
[1:11:10.000 --> 1:11:13.000]  I may put it like a computer program into our servers
[1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:15.000]  where we can't even say the word seems.
[1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:20.000]  You know, the left's banning all these other terms.
[1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:21.000]  It doesn't seem.
[1:11:21.000 --> 1:11:22.000]  It doesn't appear.
[1:11:22.000 --> 1:11:23.000]  We're under martial law.
[1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:26.000]  They're now tightening the tourniquet around our neck.
[1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:27.000]  They're strangling us.
[1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:29.000]  The noose is going around our neck.
[1:11:29.000 --> 1:11:32.000]  And now they're announcing permanent lockdowns and checkpoints
[1:11:32.000 --> 1:11:34.000]  and enforceable injections and world government.
[1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:37.000]  And I sit there and I tell people this.
[1:11:37.000 --> 1:11:41.000]  By Stephen Crowder today, I'm looking at him and I'm talking to him, interviewing me.
[1:11:41.000 --> 1:11:45.000]  And I go, you know, Bill Gates does have companies developing
[1:11:45.000 --> 1:11:50.000]  injectable microchips to make sure you're vaccinated.
[1:11:50.000 --> 1:11:53.000]  But then he knows Bill Gates has come out and said that's not true.
[1:11:53.000 --> 1:11:54.000]  Well, that's what they do.
[1:11:54.000 --> 1:11:55.000]  They go, hey, here's the companies.
[1:11:55.000 --> 1:11:57.000]  We're going to do it officially.
[1:11:57.000 --> 1:12:00.000]  MIT, Rice University, Google, all of it.
[1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:03.000]  But then they go, oh, Bill Gates doesn't want you to have chips out of the skin.
[1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:07.000]  And then the USA today the next day goes, you're going to have a chip under your skin.
[1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:10.000]  And then we play this game where we're always like stuck in gear.
[1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:12.000]  Given out of gear.
[1:12:12.000 --> 1:12:14.000]  It's all mind control.
[1:12:14.000 --> 1:12:17.000]  It doesn't work on me.
[1:12:17.000 --> 1:12:20.000]  Other than pissing me off.
[1:12:20.000 --> 1:12:22.000]  And that's why they question the tech.
[1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:23.000]  I've always noticed media matters.
[1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:25.000]  I can say the sky is blue and I'll have this whole article.
[1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:30.000]  Jones is completely discredited saying the sky is blue and saying that fish live in the ocean.
[1:12:30.000 --> 1:12:31.000]  No such thing.
[1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:36.000]  It's because they have to take whatever's popular and true and known two plus two equals four
[1:12:36.000 --> 1:12:38.000]  and say it doesn't to confuse people.
[1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:42.000]  So everyone's scared to say two plus two equals four.
[1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:50.000]  Over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over.
[1:12:50.000 --> 1:12:52.000]  That if us just speak of the truth, land it out.
[1:12:52.000 --> 1:12:54.000]  We're all unstable.
[1:12:54.000 --> 1:12:56.000]  Attention radio listeners.
[1:12:56.000 --> 1:13:01.000]  There are a lot of reasons to get an Alex Jones plastic mask at infowarstore.com.
[1:13:01.000 --> 1:13:03.000]  You can wear them out to political events.
[1:13:03.000 --> 1:13:04.000]  You can trigger live darts.
[1:13:04.000 --> 1:13:10.000]  But one of the biggest reasons is it's a great conversation starter at any costume party
[1:13:10.000 --> 1:13:12.000]  or at Halloween.
[1:13:12.000 --> 1:13:16.000]  But on top of that, they admit that wearing these masks does absolutely nothing to protect
[1:13:16.000 --> 1:13:18.000]  you from COVID-19 or anything else.
[1:13:18.000 --> 1:13:22.000]  It's total virtues signaling to show that you're prepared for the force inoculations
[1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:25.000]  and contact tracing of their openly announcing.
[1:13:25.000 --> 1:13:27.000]  It's an act of submission.
[1:13:27.000 --> 1:13:30.000]  It's an act of like putting a burqa on your head and bowing down.
[1:13:30.000 --> 1:13:34.000]  But a big reason to wear these is then into stores when people ask you why you're wearing
[1:13:34.000 --> 1:13:40.000]  a Halloween mask, say it's just as useless as the stupid cloth mask that you're wearing.
[1:13:40.000 --> 1:13:44.000]  And the M95 mask only control what's coming in, not what's going out.
[1:13:44.000 --> 1:13:46.000]  So they quote spread COVID-19.
[1:13:46.000 --> 1:13:48.000]  They don't protect from it.
[1:13:48.000 --> 1:13:50.000]  So again, it's a great way to throw it back in these control freak spaces.
[1:13:50.000 --> 1:13:53.000]  You buy one for 9.95 and get four more free.
[1:13:53.000 --> 1:14:04.000]  At cost info or store.com Vicky Gibbs, 57 year old lesbian preacher in Houston went in with
[1:14:04.000 --> 1:14:08.000]  a cough, got intubated and then died.
[1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:13.000]  And as soon as I saw her face, as soon as I saw the report, I said, watch it'll be innovation.
[1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:15.000]  We know what's going to happen.
[1:14:15.000 --> 1:14:18.000]  It's a blue city, same story yet again.
[1:14:18.000 --> 1:14:20.000]  And they say her heart gave out.
[1:14:20.000 --> 1:14:25.000]  If you put somebody on a breathing tube of COVID-19 as a death sentence, it's on record
[1:14:25.000 --> 1:14:28.000]  when everyone you know before they go to the hospital and get killed.
[1:14:28.000 --> 1:14:31.000]  Why are almost all the deaths happening in blue cities and blue states?
[1:14:31.000 --> 1:14:36.000]  It's because they intubate them, putting a tube in their lungs and COVID-19 is causing
[1:14:36.000 --> 1:14:38.000]  an autoimmune response.
[1:14:38.000 --> 1:14:43.000]  And if you do that with oxygen, the doctors are on record saying it will kill you.
[1:14:43.000 --> 1:14:48.000]  But all these doctors in blue cities and blue states follow their orders.
[1:14:48.000 --> 1:14:52.000]  And the minute I saw this report today, I knew what I would be reading.
[1:14:52.000 --> 1:14:55.000]  Don't end up like Vicky Gibbs or everyone.
[1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:02.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:15:02.000 --> 1:15:05.000]  My eyes are blind, but I can see.
[1:15:05.000 --> 1:15:33.000]  My eyes are blind, but I can see.
[1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:36.000]  Look at these deadlines.
[1:15:36.000 --> 1:15:40.000]  Europe pushing for more lockdowns despite beating back COVID-19.
[1:15:40.000 --> 1:15:44.000]  Well, because there's record numbers, because almost all the tests are fake.
[1:15:44.000 --> 1:15:46.000]  They admit that, but it doesn't care.
[1:15:46.000 --> 1:15:50.000]  The shifting of goalposts reveals the lockdowns aren't just about the virus.
[1:15:50.000 --> 1:15:54.000]  No, they're about permanent control and martial law.
[1:15:54.000 --> 1:15:58.000]  NYC to impose COVID checkpoints to enforce quarantine order.
[1:15:58.000 --> 1:16:00.000]  It's all on infowars.com.
[1:16:00.000 --> 1:16:06.000]  Meanwhile, survey, Americans think coronavirus has killed 30 million people in the U.S.
[1:16:06.000 --> 1:16:11.000]  225 times higher than actual figure.
[1:16:11.000 --> 1:16:16.000]  And I guess you just cynically decide to hate all these people and you just start feeding on them.
[1:16:16.000 --> 1:16:18.000]  I just can't do that.
[1:16:18.000 --> 1:16:24.000]  But then I've got to engage all these dumbed-down idiots being led by psychotic, globalist killers.
[1:16:24.000 --> 1:16:26.000]  And I don't want to say I'm depressed. I'm not depressed.
[1:16:26.000 --> 1:16:31.000]  I'm so pissed that I think I'm just saying this. I'm going to leave.
[1:16:31.000 --> 1:16:35.000]  You know, I tried to take off a few weeks here and there, but I didn't really take off.
[1:16:35.000 --> 1:16:37.000]  And it's not that I can't handle the news.
[1:16:37.000 --> 1:16:44.000]  It's just that maybe I'll go out the street, maybe I'll go over to the W and protest where the mayor lives.
[1:16:44.000 --> 1:16:50.000]  Maybe I'll go to Bart Springs and climb over the fence without doing a COVID-19 test and swimming the creek.
[1:16:50.000 --> 1:16:58.000]  You know, maybe I'll just physically go out there and not submit to these people and do reports on the street.
[1:16:58.000 --> 1:17:05.000]  I can sit here and just weed the chronicle of the takeover of civilization and pure evil by psychotics that are out to get everybody.
[1:17:05.000 --> 1:17:12.000]  But really, you watch the public getting into their own enslavement and all the lazy neuroticness of people unable to get anything done.
[1:17:12.000 --> 1:17:19.000]  And it just makes me wonder, man, why didn't God just tell us all?
[1:17:19.000 --> 1:17:27.000]  See, here's the deal. Bill Gates plays God, so he thinks we need to be killed because we're such lazy scum, but he's worse than us.
[1:17:27.000 --> 1:17:35.000]  So I would respect him if he slit his own throat, blew his own head off on national television, but he doesn't do that.
[1:17:35.000 --> 1:17:42.000]  He's horrible, degenerate, filthy, lying, anti-human piece of trash, one of the worst examples of our people,
[1:17:42.000 --> 1:17:47.000]  and then he looks at us and hates us because he hates himself. I don't hate people.
[1:17:47.000 --> 1:18:01.000]  I'm just sick of all day knowing about this stuff and watching how ridiculous it gets and that babbling, brain-dead, dumbass lawyer,
[1:18:01.000 --> 1:18:13.000]  Joe Biden stumbling around, emblematically, that's what rules over us with all these candy-ass butt-kissers that sit there and play along with this lunatic asylum.
[1:18:13.000 --> 1:18:18.000]  All right, listen, I've made you hold long enough. I said I was to take calls. I want to hear from you.
[1:18:18.000 --> 1:18:24.000]  I thank you. You thank me. Let's suspense with the pleasantries. Let's just get to your point.
[1:18:24.000 --> 1:18:28.000]  And here's the thing I've been going through with this telos phone system for years.
[1:18:28.000 --> 1:18:38.000]  So today's going to be a new day. When I go for a caller, when I say their name, we hit the button, and it goes shh.
[1:18:38.000 --> 1:18:43.000]  So they don't hear me saying their name. So the new thing I'm going to do is I'm going to say their name once,
[1:18:43.000 --> 1:18:48.000]  and then I'm going to say it again, and we go to it the second time. And we are going to defeat this.
[1:18:48.000 --> 1:18:54.000]  We can just defeat this. It's one thing. I love calls. The part I hate is the connecting with them.
[1:18:54.000 --> 1:18:59.000]  And the hello, hello, hello. So we're going to do this right now.
[1:18:59.000 --> 1:19:06.000]  We got Jim. We got Brandon. We got Mike. We got Nicholas. We got Wild. We got Joe. We got Carlos. We got John. We got David.
[1:19:06.000 --> 1:19:11.000]  I love Carlos. He's a longtime regular caller. I'm going to stop bitching and be a whiny ass.
[1:19:11.000 --> 1:19:16.000]  Maybe I just won't be here for a few weeks. Maybe I'll just quit and leave. I'm serious. I'm not f-
[1:19:16.000 --> 1:19:22.000]  I just, man, I tell you, I don't want to be around it anymore. Carlos and Canada, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[1:19:22.000 --> 1:19:29.000]  Thank you, Alex. I watched your program on Saturday, a very special program with Dr. Pashinik,
[1:19:29.000 --> 1:19:37.000]  and very important, very relevant. And there was an aspect of his conversation, which I wanted to address with you today,
[1:19:37.000 --> 1:19:41.000]  and also to provide solutions, because that's what is really needed.
[1:19:41.000 --> 1:19:49.000]  I will take about 30 seconds to read something that is familiar, but which has four little words at the end,
[1:19:49.000 --> 1:19:57.000]  and which are very short words, but they're very important, and are addressed specifically to President Trump.
[1:19:57.000 --> 1:19:59.000]  It reads like this,
[1:20:27.000 --> 1:20:35.000]  Well, and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter.
[1:20:35.000 --> 1:20:44.000]  So help me God. Two letters, four letters, two letters, and three letters.
[1:20:44.000 --> 1:20:52.000]  So help me God means that if you betray the words that you have just uttered beforehand,
[1:20:52.000 --> 1:21:02.000]  freely, without any mental reservation and purpose of evasion, then you, sir, are in the domain of the President of the United States of America.
[1:21:02.000 --> 1:21:08.000]  And you, madam, sir, who took office cannot deny the protection of the American people,
[1:21:08.000 --> 1:21:17.000]  lest the President of the United States remind you, so help you God.
[1:21:17.000 --> 1:21:24.000]  And so has Trump faithfully executed the office to which he swore before God?
[1:21:24.000 --> 1:21:30.000]  All the people, all the governors, people that have said that you cannot do this, they won't do this,
[1:21:30.000 --> 1:21:35.000]  they will not protect the American people, forcing the President to threaten to bring in the military,
[1:21:35.000 --> 1:21:43.000]  who are not fulfilling their office, 80 days before an election, who are playing around with the voting rights of Americans,
[1:21:43.000 --> 1:21:50.000]  personal, one person, one vote, personal representation, put your signature, your John Hancock.
[1:21:50.000 --> 1:21:55.000]  Yeah, we're having our whole birth right no matter what color we are, we're being robbed right now, that's why I'm pissed.
[1:21:55.000 --> 1:22:01.000]  Exactly, and that is why they're entering the domain of the four little words in that oath.
[1:22:01.000 --> 1:22:11.000]  There is a governor in Illinois, Governor Jay Pritzker, who said, oh no, you cannot bring the military here, no, no, no way, we're not going to have that.
[1:22:11.000 --> 1:22:18.000]  Believe me, the President has every authority to do it, it's called the Insurrection Act, and it requires that.
[1:22:18.000 --> 1:22:23.000]  And by the way, what the Democrats and the Globalists are doing is insurrection against the country.
[1:22:23.000 --> 1:22:27.000]  People go, Jones is for martial law, they've already created their own martial law, they're ignoring the law,
[1:22:27.000 --> 1:22:34.000]  they're ignoring the Constitution, that's martial law, so the President needs to come back in and enforce the Bill of Rights right now.
[1:22:34.000 --> 1:22:46.000]  Exactly, so it is because, as I think I mentioned to you before, and you know, Dr. Peschenik failed to, I think, not failed, but he didn't mention something very important.
[1:22:46.000 --> 1:23:00.000]  And that is that what's happening to the United States today, you and I discussed this before, is being conducted by the interests of international financiers who do not care what happens to destroy a country at all.
[1:23:00.000 --> 1:23:05.000]  As long as the country depends and comes back, hat in hand.
[1:23:05.000 --> 1:23:12.000]  Well, yeah, no, no, no, no, stay there, Carlos, because they don't care, they want to destroy you and make you independent, they want to destroy real economies.
[1:23:12.000 --> 1:23:17.000]  This whole COVID thing is about destroying people that are self-sufficient, that's what this is.
[1:23:17.000 --> 1:23:20.000]  We're all learning to go under welfare right now.
[1:23:20.000 --> 1:23:29.000]  That is right, and if you remember, the Senate was given a very, very good warning about this by Paul Werberg, an international financier.
[1:23:29.000 --> 1:23:37.000]  When we talk about that, we come back, two more minutes Carlos, we really appreciate you calling Carlos a smart cookie, about the place we're at in society in history.
[1:23:37.000 --> 1:23:39.000]  And again, folks, I apologize if I get down on air.
[1:23:39.000 --> 1:23:42.000]  The show's not an act, the media says it's an act, it's the opposite of that.
[1:23:42.000 --> 1:23:44.000]  What you see on air is what's going on, okay?
[1:23:44.000 --> 1:23:48.000]  And I'll try to tough it out, I'll get the nasty mood and I apologize.
[1:23:48.000 --> 1:23:50.000]  I'm really pissed, I know you are too.
[1:23:50.000 --> 1:23:54.000]  I'm at my breaking point now, I'm telling you, we're right back, stay with us.
[1:23:54.000 --> 1:24:07.000]  States cracking down on social gatherings says CNN, because Fauci says if we don't, we'll see further surges in coronavirus positives.
[1:24:07.000 --> 1:24:16.000]  Because they're only ramping up the testing, and because the tests have been designed at the Wuhan lab, it turns out, to be completely fraudulent.
[1:24:16.000 --> 1:24:28.000]  They cook the whole thing up, offshore, in a Communist dictatorship, with Fauci, Bill Gates, and the Chai comms, to be directed by the UN as a giant planetary power grab.
[1:24:28.000 --> 1:24:41.000]  And now, it's all over the news that indeed Bill Gates has developed digital tattoos under your skin, and so has Google, and they're deploying them at the airports next year, where you'll have to have it to be able to travel,
[1:24:41.000 --> 1:24:50.000]  and then soon to leave your house or go in a grocery store, and the contact tracers work for Bill Gates and the Clintons, and they're going to come to your house and make sure you're inoculated.
[1:24:50.000 --> 1:25:16.000]  Yes, we're now inside the Mark of the Beast, resist to be enslaved.

[1:26:57.000 --> 1:27:17.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:27:17.000 --> 1:27:27.000]  We've been trained to put up being slaves of our kids killed right in front of us. The governors brag about keeping babies alive and taking their organs.
[1:27:27.000 --> 1:27:37.000]  The good news is we've been very blessed to have InfoWars. We've been very blessed to counter the globalists.
[1:27:37.000 --> 1:27:48.000]  We've been trained to put up being slaves of our kids killed right in front of us. We've been very blessed to have InfoWars. We've been very blessed to have InfoWars.
[1:27:48.000 --> 1:28:11.000]  We've been trained to put up being slaves of our kids killed right in front of us. We've been very blessed to have InfoWars.
[1:28:11.000 --> 1:28:20.000]  And then, you know, the Clintons run the contact tracers and get the money. Like, Texas gave billions of dollars to a company that part of it goes to Bill Clinton.
[1:28:20.000 --> 1:28:26.000]  My tax money. Governor Abbott gave it to a Google company that gives part of the money to Chelsea Clinton.
[1:28:26.000 --> 1:28:31.000]  And it's just like, you can't get them out of your lives, man.
[1:28:31.000 --> 1:28:50.000]  So, you know, we've just gone too far. We've gone too far putting up with this politically. And I'm not saying we should offensively get violent, but my brain and my genes, my cells are saying, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill.
[1:28:50.000 --> 1:28:57.000]  I mean, they're killing us. Bill Gates is coming with a weapon to kill us slowly and laugh about it.
[1:28:57.000 --> 1:29:04.000]  I mean, he's on TV laughing how it's going to make us sick and laughing how we're in a depression and it pisses me off and you need to get pissed.
[1:29:04.000 --> 1:29:09.000]  I don't care what he does to me. I just want him off of our back.
[1:29:09.000 --> 1:29:16.000]  I don't even want harm against Bill Gates because he doesn't exist. He's a gateway to hell.
[1:29:16.000 --> 1:29:25.000]  He's a wormhole. He's a crack in the fabric of time that a demon is looking through. That's all he is.
[1:29:25.000 --> 1:29:33.000]  He's already judged. He's already done. But you need to reject him because when you submit to him, you become him.
[1:29:33.000 --> 1:29:38.000]  And that's just it. I feel the people separating right now and dividing ourselves.
[1:29:38.000 --> 1:29:46.000]  And that's why I try to make it about sex or race or where you're from because that's all they've got because they know it's really a spiritual thing.
[1:29:46.000 --> 1:29:51.000]  At least to be positive and thank God we should just pray and put it on God. I tell myself that. I'm not preaching at you.
[1:29:51.000 --> 1:29:56.000]  That's why I talk about myself on air because all the way I know how to interface this is how I'm dealing with it.
[1:29:56.000 --> 1:30:00.000]  And I know you're dealing with it the same way. So I'm going to shut up. I said I'd go to your calls and I apologize.
[1:30:00.000 --> 1:30:03.000]  Getting callers on or not getting there. But I know a little bit better job these days.
[1:30:03.000 --> 1:30:10.000]  Carlos is making some great points. Solution. Trump has less than 12 weeks. 89 days left. What do you think? Carlos, finish your points.
[1:30:10.000 --> 1:30:26.000]  Well, I think that the president of the United States, this is entering the phase where now you're in the so help me God aspect of the oath of office that a lot of governors, congressmen, senators have taken.
[1:30:26.000 --> 1:30:37.000]  You cannot allow the individual person in the street to start thinking of affecting a citizen's arrest or taking the law in his or her own hands.
[1:30:37.000 --> 1:30:49.000]  This is past the point. This is where the president of the United States, John F. Kennedy, invoked insurrection act in 1962. President Lyndon Johnson, President George Herbert Walker Bush did as well.
[1:30:49.000 --> 1:30:56.000]  So these are giant problems that if the country doesn't act as a nation, it dies. It's a country level event.
[1:30:56.000 --> 1:31:06.000]  Yes. Well, you know, black lives matter. The point has been made. Police brutality has been recognized. All the rest is poetry. What these people are doing is terrorism.
[1:31:06.000 --> 1:31:15.000]  The point has been made. How much are they going to hammer to the nail to the ground? I mean, come on, it's finished. We understand.
[1:31:15.000 --> 1:31:22.000]  Police have gotten the message. How far do you want to take this? You're taking this now all the way to Stalin. Come on, let's get real.
[1:31:22.000 --> 1:31:36.000]  OK, so I think it's time in the next 80 days where the American people, there's a very good line, you know, in the movie The Patriot, which a lot of Americans should watch soon. Mel Gibson is running up the hill. The flag falls.
[1:31:36.000 --> 1:31:46.000]  He picks it up. They're over the ridge. The British are winning. And he waves his flag to let everybody know. Wait a second. It's not over until it's over.
[1:31:46.000 --> 1:32:01.000]  There's always the last few little words. So help me, God. And at that point, it turns around and victory is there. Why? Because all of a sudden, running away from reality doesn't pay.
[1:32:01.000 --> 1:32:06.000]  There is that little virtue that defines the Patriot, that defines America.
[1:32:06.000 --> 1:32:19.000]  I totally agree with you. And that's cute. You said that dropping the flag and running, people have gotten away forever with deserting responsibility and still living off what forebearers put in the gas tank.
[1:32:19.000 --> 1:32:28.000]  Now it's all gone. Now running makes you less safe. I think people now are starting to realize that's why I'm physically, like, constantly can't stop thinking about what am I going to do physically?
[1:32:28.000 --> 1:32:40.000]  I might say I'm going to do something violent. I'm saying my body is like, I need to go out and confront people. I need to get really aggressive, Carlos. I mean, my cells are like, just like driving me to do something.
[1:32:40.000 --> 1:33:02.000]  So when you have communist agitators, these people were spoken about two years ago, three years ago, when they were invited to do what they did in Ukraine. What it surprises me is that they haven't yet started putting snipers on roofs and killing people like they did in Kiev.
[1:33:02.000 --> 1:33:15.000]  But let me tell you this, okay? It's the message clear now. The president of the United States has 80 days in which he has to remind people that this is the domain of which he's the president.
[1:33:15.000 --> 1:33:24.000]  He was given the mandate, the hammers of hell will fall on you unless you break faith with your oath and with your country.
[1:33:24.000 --> 1:33:35.000]  This is the domain because what I see is essentially from President Obama onward, who basically said on 90 days, we're going to get rid of this fool.
[1:33:35.000 --> 1:33:48.000]  A constitutional professor saying that? Please, give me a break. No, this is the moment of truth. And if President Trump is elected again, of course, I think he should be.
[1:33:48.000 --> 1:33:57.000]  At this stage of the game, he has to understand that so help me God are the words that rule from his office onward.
[1:33:57.000 --> 1:34:08.000]  I agree with you, Carlos. Thank you so much for the call. I spent a lot of time with Carlos. Now we'll get to everybody. 877-789-Alex. 877-789-2539.
[1:34:08.000 --> 1:34:11.000]  Let's talk to David in California. Thanks for holding, David. I appreciate you.
[1:34:11.000 --> 1:34:13.000]  Hey, how are you doing, Alex?
[1:34:13.000 --> 1:34:23.000]  Man, I've never felt like this. I feel enraged. I feel sick. I feel angry. I just feel like war. It's a bad feeling.
[1:34:23.000 --> 1:34:31.000]  Well, you're not alone in that fight. It's an honor to talk to you. I've been trying to talk to you for a while.
[1:34:31.000 --> 1:34:34.000]  God bless you for putting up with me, brother. What's on your mind?
[1:34:34.000 --> 1:34:45.000]  Oh, it's on my mind. First of all, I just want to listen to the reason why I started listening to you a few years back, about six, seven years ago, was that the Holy Ghost led me to you.
[1:34:45.000 --> 1:34:53.000]  And the message was when the first words that I heard come out your mouth was that the golden life is to have eternal life.
[1:34:53.000 --> 1:35:00.000]  And this is what I always know in all my life. And this is what I always try to explain and spread the message and let people understand and let the Holy Ghost do the rest of the work.
[1:35:00.000 --> 1:35:07.000]  So I just want your listeners to know that's the reason why I listened to you. I was led to you by the Holy Ghost, so I know I'm in the right place.
[1:35:07.000 --> 1:35:11.000]  Describe that process. What was that like?
[1:35:11.000 --> 1:35:23.000]  That process is just when the Holy Ghost is speaking to you, it always gives us confirmation. And the confirmation was that when I heard about you and I said, well, let me check this guy out.
[1:35:23.000 --> 1:35:31.000]  Let me go onto YouTube and check him out. So when I first turned to you, the first thing I heard you say was that the golden life is to have eternal life.
[1:35:31.000 --> 1:35:38.000]  That's my golden life. And that's actually my golden life. And I was just speaking in reference to what you were saying that day.
[1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:46.000]  And I knew I was in the right place because that's what I've experienced all my life. You have to be spiritually entombed with God.
[1:35:46.000 --> 1:35:51.000]  And it's just so much honor to speak to you.
[1:35:51.000 --> 1:35:58.000]  Honor to talk to you, sir. So what do you think is about to happen? Is everybody can tell we're at a major crossroads?
[1:35:58.000 --> 1:36:18.000]  Yes, sir, we are. What's about to happen, what I think is we're basically like a few of you callers this past week has been calling in and saying that we basically have to go through this to get to heaven, to get to the great testament of men and women to see who's on the right side.
[1:36:18.000 --> 1:36:26.000]  And if you're putting up with this with all this evil stuff and the people who are putting up with this, they're going to be the ones who's going to be on the evil side.
[1:36:26.000 --> 1:36:40.000]  As far as what we got to go through as spiritual and godly people is knowing that what's to come and understanding that and having to deal with that and fighting with the people that's not on our side.
[1:36:40.000 --> 1:36:43.000]  We just have to accept that and move on.
[1:36:43.000 --> 1:36:50.000]  Powerful testimony, David. On the other side, tell us about your comments on vaccines and exposing the lives and more calls with everybody.
[1:36:50.000 --> 1:36:54.000]  Please stay with us. Jim, Mike, Nicholas, Wild, Joe and others.
[1:36:54.000 --> 1:37:08.000]  A lot of you have been listening for more than 20 years. And if you go back to those shows, we laid out the AI takeover plan, the tracking of cell phones, how programmed master computers would manipulate control society,
[1:37:08.000 --> 1:37:15.000]  how they'd be able to not just predict large groups of human movements and activities, but even predict what individuals would do.
[1:37:15.000 --> 1:37:30.000]  And then once you can predict what individuals were going to be doing, you can add stimuli through the AI systems, through the computers, through digital billboards, through face scanning, through the social credit score to control people and make them act like you wanted to.
[1:37:30.000 --> 1:37:39.000]  But when we cover that, the media would attack us and say, we were making it up. It was a conspiracy theory, even though it was in the actual corporate level blueprint documents.
[1:37:39.000 --> 1:37:47.000]  Well, the next level of the blueprint documents explained to us that they are setting up this control system to make humans obsolete and phase us out.
[1:37:47.000 --> 1:37:54.000]  And it's something about a thousand times crazier than what Hitler planned. So we might want to dismantle the system now.
[1:37:54.000 --> 1:38:03.000]  America and the world should have never been closed. It was all based on WHO, Bill and Melinda Gates, Fauci NIH lives.
[1:38:03.000 --> 1:38:16.000]  But now here we are already into August and they're trying to keep our stores, our factories, our schools, our parks closed. It is outrageous.

[1:38:55.000 --> 1:39:02.000]  It was in the Telecommunications Act of 1996 that all new cell phones would track your GPS location.
[1:39:02.000 --> 1:39:07.000]  I read from the federal law and listeners couldn't believe me because that was un-American.
[1:39:07.000 --> 1:39:13.000]  Now the media admits that almost every app and every company that are on Apple and on Droids.
[1:39:13.000 --> 1:39:24.000]  Don't just track your location but your surfing history, where you go, who you talk to, your relationships and they all share the data with each other of what you're doing on the apps as well.
[1:39:24.000 --> 1:39:36.000]  Including having apps turn on and listen to what you're saying just like Siri or Alexa do and then putting databases, transcripts of everything you say into those systems to be saved forever.
[1:39:36.000 --> 1:39:41.000]  Your phone is spying on you and companies are generating secret surveillance scores based on information.
[1:39:41.000 --> 1:39:44.000]  This is the Global Chinese Communist Social Credit Score.

[1:40:10.000 --> 1:40:25.000]  In January 2016, I went to VA Hospital out here in Boyce and I was in there until June and one of the only things that got me through that ordeal was listening to info wars three hours a day and I kept hearing Dr. Group and all you guys talking about living defense.
[1:40:25.000 --> 1:40:26.000]  Let me tell you something, man.
[1:40:26.000 --> 1:40:33.000]  I had an internal digestive problem and I stumbled with it for about five or six years and the doctors, they tried every test.
[1:40:33.000 --> 1:40:35.000]  Nobody could figure out what it is.
[1:40:35.000 --> 1:40:41.000]  And then every day when I kept hearing you and Dr. Group and those commercials, I said, you know what, I'm going to get me some of that freaking living defense.
[1:40:41.000 --> 1:40:46.000]  Now, I wasn't supposed to have any nutritionals because they don't want you to have a stuff, but I ordered it, had it shipped to me.
[1:40:46.000 --> 1:40:48.000]  I got it, I hid it from the nurses.
[1:40:48.000 --> 1:40:49.000]  I started taking it, man.
[1:40:49.000 --> 1:40:51.000]  That stuff changed my life.
[1:40:51.000 --> 1:40:52.000]  It saved my life.
[1:40:52.000 --> 1:41:06.000]  Alex Jones and info wars saved my life.
[1:41:06.000 --> 1:41:26.000]  Well, you've got your diamonds and you've got your pretty clothes and the chauffeur drives your car.
[1:41:26.000 --> 1:41:36.000]  The economy is going into a global depression.
[1:41:36.000 --> 1:41:38.000]  People are starving to death everywhere.
[1:41:38.000 --> 1:41:43.000]  In the West, Americans owe 21 billion in back rent.
[1:41:43.000 --> 1:41:48.000]  Up to half of small businesses that have closed will never reopen.
[1:41:48.000 --> 1:41:57.000]  It just makes me sick to watch them say it's COVID doing it when it's the lockdown that did it and everything they have put out about it's been a lie.
[1:41:57.000 --> 1:42:01.000]  And then Dr. Gates decides who can be on the Internet and who can't.
[1:42:01.000 --> 1:42:05.000]  We just wake up in this nightmare and it gets worse and worse.
[1:42:05.000 --> 1:42:07.000]  And I was downtown today.
[1:42:07.000 --> 1:42:10.000]  Stephen Crowder, we're going back to your calls right now.
[1:42:10.000 --> 1:42:13.000]  Back to David.
[1:42:13.000 --> 1:42:19.000]  And no one was around by the police station that they've announced they want to blow up the city council.
[1:42:19.000 --> 1:42:22.000]  In the budget.
[1:42:22.000 --> 1:42:27.000]  And Owen pulls up the armored vehicle.
[1:42:27.000 --> 1:42:30.000]  Going USA USA as he pulls up.
[1:42:30.000 --> 1:42:33.000]  It's like an empty street out there.
[1:42:33.000 --> 1:42:38.000]  And all of a sudden these women boil out of the shadows white women.
[1:42:38.000 --> 1:42:43.000]  And like wagons with dogs and stuff and they go F you and F America.
[1:42:43.000 --> 1:42:45.000]  And I'm like but you live off America.
[1:42:45.000 --> 1:42:50.000]  Why do you want to fail as he goes F you and all these homeless boil out of go F America F America.
[1:42:50.000 --> 1:42:57.000]  And I could have got out and got footage of it but it was so sick that I just I just drove off and came to the office.
[1:42:57.000 --> 1:43:02.000]  He was driving around and he brought the car so I could get it and he he left with the security guys.
[1:43:02.000 --> 1:43:07.000]  And it was just.
[1:43:07.000 --> 1:43:11.000]  It was it was the craziness of how.
[1:43:11.000 --> 1:43:16.000]  If you're an old person and you don't pay your income tax they'll take your house and throw you out of your house.
[1:43:16.000 --> 1:43:20.000]  If you're a homeless person you get all this free stuff and then you hate the country.
[1:43:20.000 --> 1:43:24.000]  But it's homeless people didn't used to say we hate America.
[1:43:24.000 --> 1:43:30.000]  The Democrats have successfully made it the operating system to know they're part of a foreign power.
[1:43:30.000 --> 1:43:32.000]  China ships from the fentanyl.
[1:43:32.000 --> 1:43:33.000]  Hollywood hates America.
[1:43:33.000 --> 1:43:34.000]  They're in the club.
[1:43:34.000 --> 1:43:35.000]  They're the winners.
[1:43:35.000 --> 1:43:47.000]  And now all these leftist and homeless people and weirdos know they're part of the team like an army of zombies to defecate everywhere and shoot up with needles and and then we're defeated by it.
[1:43:47.000 --> 1:44:00.000]  It's like an army of zombies Joe Biden's a zombie Hillary's a zombie Maxine Waters is a zombie figure of the house Nancy Pelosi is a zombie.
[1:44:00.000 --> 1:44:01.000]  But it's on purpose.
[1:44:01.000 --> 1:44:08.000]  It's like yeah you think you're so strong you're ruled by zombies.
[1:44:08.000 --> 1:44:11.000]  I mean I was downtown folks.
[1:44:11.000 --> 1:44:15.000]  And there were drug addicts laying on the ground with sores all over them.
[1:44:15.000 --> 1:44:18.000]  It smelled so bad.
[1:44:18.000 --> 1:44:23.000]  And it was like something out of a movie they're like crawling around the corner and there's feces everywhere.
[1:44:23.000 --> 1:44:27.000]  And it's just like what happened to where I live.
[1:44:27.000 --> 1:44:30.000]  Overnight.
[1:44:30.000 --> 1:44:42.000]  Because the Democrats run the drugs and they get the left to pass higher money for homeless and they get that homeless check and they take it and they sell them the fentanyl on top of it.
[1:44:42.000 --> 1:44:49.000]  The city council of Austin except for one or two members are drug dealing psychotic murderers.
[1:44:49.000 --> 1:44:52.000]  They caught him running human trafficking you name it.
[1:44:52.000 --> 1:44:56.000]  I mean that that's all this is folks is a total criminal takeover.
[1:44:56.000 --> 1:44:57.000]  I'm going to shut up.
[1:44:57.000 --> 1:44:58.000]  I'm sorry.
[1:44:58.000 --> 1:45:03.000]  David in California get into vaccines and what else you were talking about sir.
[1:45:03.000 --> 1:45:04.000]  Thank you.
[1:45:04.000 --> 1:45:05.000]  Yes sir.
[1:45:05.000 --> 1:45:07.000]  First of all I'm a black Trump supporter.
[1:45:07.000 --> 1:45:08.000]  Also I'm an ex felon.
[1:45:08.000 --> 1:45:10.000]  I'm from the area where you grew up at.
[1:45:10.000 --> 1:45:11.000]  I'm from Texas.
[1:45:11.000 --> 1:45:13.000]  I went to Westwood junior high.
[1:45:13.000 --> 1:45:16.000]  I'm from Dallas Texas the Plano area.
[1:45:16.000 --> 1:45:24.000]  And like I said I understood what you and also I want to just speak about the vaccines a little bit when I was incarcerated back in 2000 and 2001.
[1:45:24.000 --> 1:45:29.000]  I was not able to make the role unless I took the hepatitis A and B vaccine shot.
[1:45:29.000 --> 1:45:36.000]  And I was forced to take it and I just want the listeners to know that before any vaccine is released to the public.
[1:45:36.000 --> 1:45:38.000]  It's always testing inside the penitentiary.
[1:45:38.000 --> 1:45:46.000]  I guarantee you right now this people already have the vaccine for COVID-19 to make parole all before they release out of the penitentiary in TDC.
[1:45:46.000 --> 1:45:48.000]  TDCJ facilities.
[1:45:48.000 --> 1:45:49.000]  I guarantee it.
[1:45:49.000 --> 1:45:53.000]  Also to fight against this where we at now about kids going to school.
[1:45:53.000 --> 1:46:03.000]  They can compare the numbers the flu numbers to kids being infected with the flu influenza flu with the flu influenza virus every single year.
[1:46:03.000 --> 1:46:09.000]  And just put those numbers up versus the fact of the 2019 and 2020 numbers which it doesn't even add up.
[1:46:09.000 --> 1:46:13.000]  It doesn't make any sense because they're saying kids right now are still being infected by the flu.
[1:46:13.000 --> 1:46:15.000]  What happened to the COVID-19?
[1:46:15.000 --> 1:46:18.000]  I don't understand how you guys are able to distinguish that the difference.
[1:46:18.000 --> 1:46:23.000]  Sir, you're absolutely right. I wish the American people understood stuff like you do.
[1:46:23.000 --> 1:46:26.000]  They're saying this has an infection rate and death rate.
[1:46:26.000 --> 1:46:28.000]  Three quarters.
[1:46:28.000 --> 1:46:31.000]  It's one quarter of what the flu is.
[1:46:31.000 --> 1:46:33.000]  And that's with inflated numbers.
[1:46:33.000 --> 1:46:39.000]  And then they admit that they're counting all these other people that died of something else.
[1:46:39.000 --> 1:46:41.000]  I mean it's just a giant fraud.
[1:46:41.000 --> 1:46:43.000]  It doesn't mean there isn't real pneumonia.
[1:46:43.000 --> 1:46:44.000]  It doesn't mean people don't really die.
[1:46:44.000 --> 1:46:45.000]  That's always happening.
[1:46:45.000 --> 1:46:47.000]  And so it's just crazy how they're saying it's never going to end.
[1:46:47.000 --> 1:46:49.000]  David, thank you so much. Good to hear from you.
[1:46:49.000 --> 1:46:51.000]  All right. Again, I really appreciate callers holding.
[1:46:51.000 --> 1:46:53.000]  Jim in Kentucky, then Mike and others.
[1:46:53.000 --> 1:46:55.000]  Jim, welcome, sir.
[1:46:55.000 --> 1:46:59.000]  Yes, I'd like you to go ahead and throw away our cell phones.
[1:46:59.000 --> 1:47:02.000]  We don't need them. Get our landlines back.
[1:47:02.000 --> 1:47:05.000]  Go ahead and get rid of our computers. We don't need those.
[1:47:05.000 --> 1:47:07.000]  We'll go back old school.
[1:47:07.000 --> 1:47:09.000]  Old school is the only school.
[1:47:09.000 --> 1:47:14.000]  And then for you having your hate, you might want to take some yoga classes
[1:47:14.000 --> 1:47:19.000]  to understand the more angry they make you, the more they control you.
[1:47:19.000 --> 1:47:22.000]  There ain't no sense of getting mad and it's going to change nothing.
[1:47:22.000 --> 1:47:24.000]  Sir, I know that. I agree with you.
[1:47:24.000 --> 1:47:28.000]  I pray to not get it. It's not even angry. I'm sick of it.
[1:47:28.000 --> 1:47:30.000]  I'm sick of looking at them.
[1:47:30.000 --> 1:47:34.000]  It's not even, I'm just, it's discussed. How do I deal with disgust then?
[1:47:34.000 --> 1:47:37.000]  Well, you got to just relax. You got to relax.
[1:47:37.000 --> 1:47:43.000]  You think clear your body's under less stress when you relax.
[1:47:43.000 --> 1:47:46.000]  No, I agree with you, but one reason we've been effective is I am upset
[1:47:46.000 --> 1:47:49.000]  and get people out of their comfort zone. There's got to be a balance.
[1:47:49.000 --> 1:47:52.000]  Because I, you know, I mean...
[1:47:52.000 --> 1:47:57.000]  And he was on the front line. I'll guarantee it was as cool as Joe Montana.
[1:47:57.000 --> 1:47:59.000]  Who are you talking about?
[1:47:59.000 --> 1:48:03.000]  George Washington, our founding father, when he was battling the British
[1:48:03.000 --> 1:48:07.000]  and we kept losing and losing and losing. He didn't get mad if you,
[1:48:07.000 --> 1:48:10.000]  you know what I mean? He kept cool like Joe Montana.
[1:48:10.000 --> 1:48:14.000]  Damn, it looks like it's over, okay? Cold Joe's there.
[1:48:14.000 --> 1:48:18.000]  Joe doesn't get angry. Joe pulls it out.
[1:48:18.000 --> 1:48:22.000]  There was so many victories he had where it looked like it was impossible.
[1:48:22.000 --> 1:48:26.000]  You got to get that Joe Montana attitude. Stay cool.
[1:48:26.000 --> 1:48:28.000]  Well, I do. I mean, I don't ever give up.
[1:48:28.000 --> 1:48:33.000]  I'm just particularly feeling really nasty right now and really pissed off at these people.
[1:48:33.000 --> 1:48:37.000]  And I agree with you. I've got to somehow just give it to God and be cool about it.
[1:48:37.000 --> 1:48:41.000]  But I can't let them eat me up. I mean, here's the problem.
[1:48:41.000 --> 1:48:43.000]  They deserve to be dealt with physically for what they've done,
[1:48:43.000 --> 1:48:46.000]  but I know that they'll set it up and hurt us if we do that.
[1:48:46.000 --> 1:48:49.000]  What are you doing when people are assaulting you and Bill Gates is coming with a poison vaccine
[1:48:49.000 --> 1:48:53.000]  and he admits it's going to hurt you and we know a bunch of ignorant people are going to get hurt by it.
[1:48:53.000 --> 1:48:57.000]  I as a man, and I've never been somebody that shoots my mouth open about physical stuff
[1:48:57.000 --> 1:49:01.000]  and being honest with the audience, I feel physically angry towards these people.
[1:49:01.000 --> 1:49:05.000]  I'm not hating them. I want to get them off our back. Do you understand what I'm saying?
[1:49:05.000 --> 1:49:09.000]  Yes, but if you get rid of your cell phone, then you don't have no Bill Gates.
[1:49:09.000 --> 1:49:13.000]  You get rid of your computer. You have no Bill Gates. You lose his control.
[1:49:13.000 --> 1:49:17.000]  No, you're right. We have to, exactly. And it's a balance.
[1:49:17.000 --> 1:49:20.000]  Who's going to be on the grid and off the grid? I agree with you, though.
[1:49:20.000 --> 1:49:23.000]  This whole thing's a trap. Now, the technology's bad.
[1:49:23.000 --> 1:49:26.000]  It's that they've set it up as a trap, like a fish trap.
[1:49:26.000 --> 1:49:30.000]  Fish will swim into something to get food, but they're scared to swim out.
[1:49:30.000 --> 1:49:34.000]  It's psychological. And so now we're in the trap. What do we do?
[1:49:34.000 --> 1:49:39.000]  You live without the cell phone before the cell phone. Get your landline back.
[1:49:39.000 --> 1:49:43.000]  Okay, no more cell phones. No more being tracked.
[1:49:43.000 --> 1:49:46.000]  You don't need to know or talk to anybody till you get home.
[1:49:46.000 --> 1:49:48.000]  They'll just wait like they did before.
[1:49:48.000 --> 1:49:52.000]  Well, it was so fun, too. We talk about meetups, where we're going to meet on Saturday night
[1:49:52.000 --> 1:49:55.000]  or Wednesday night, or we'll meet at church, we'll meet at this hamburger place.
[1:49:55.000 --> 1:49:59.000]  It was fun because everyone was there, and that was the scene.
[1:49:59.000 --> 1:50:02.000]  And I'd have a little notepad even when I was a teenager.
[1:50:02.000 --> 1:50:07.000]  I had phone numbers and girls and stuff or whatever, but I knew hundreds of numbers.
[1:50:07.000 --> 1:50:11.000]  I mean, I knew hundreds of numbers, and now it does it all for you, and you're right.
[1:50:11.000 --> 1:50:13.000]  All of it dehumanizes us.
[1:50:13.000 --> 1:50:18.000]  Look at the couples that are fighting on the cell phones because they're talking to each other too much.
[1:50:18.000 --> 1:50:22.000]  A problem happens at home. The guy can't get home. He's got a word.
[1:50:22.000 --> 1:50:24.000]  Knowing that problem, it makes them angry.
[1:50:24.000 --> 1:50:29.000]  No, you're absolutely right. It totally screws up couples that she tells you what's going on
[1:50:29.000 --> 1:50:34.000]  and you tell her what's going on instead of like the fun of not seeing her until you get home
[1:50:34.000 --> 1:50:36.000]  and the mystery of it, you know?
[1:50:36.000 --> 1:50:42.000]  And you can't take care of it until you get home anyway. That's the whole thing.
[1:50:42.000 --> 1:50:45.000]  Well, you're a smart philosopher, Jim. What else should we do?
[1:50:45.000 --> 1:50:52.000]  Well, I think if we go ahead and blow off Bill Gates and start protesting at Pfizer,
[1:50:52.000 --> 1:50:56.000]  start protesting at these places where the vaccines are being made.
[1:50:56.000 --> 1:50:59.000]  Give them hell. We got a lot of people who are unemployed.
[1:50:59.000 --> 1:51:03.000]  Let's use those people as an army to protest at these positions.
[1:51:03.000 --> 1:51:06.000]  They won't know how to handle that.
[1:51:06.000 --> 1:51:10.000]  Protests applause these mansions. She won't know how to handle it.
[1:51:10.000 --> 1:51:15.000]  Protest at the problem where they're causing the problem.
[1:51:15.000 --> 1:51:19.000]  Let us take it to them now. They've been attacking us.
[1:51:19.000 --> 1:51:22.000]  Now it's time for us to pack full force.
[1:51:22.000 --> 1:51:26.000]  Well, you don't sound too yoga-ed out now, brother, but out here, you're not hateful.
[1:51:26.000 --> 1:51:28.000]  You're not angry. You're just taking action.
[1:51:28.000 --> 1:51:30.000]  That's the spirit we have to have in your damn right.
[1:51:30.000 --> 1:51:32.000]  You're absolutely right, brother.
[1:51:32.000 --> 1:51:34.000]  All right. We'll be right back.
[1:51:34.000 --> 1:51:37.000]  The next hour of Warrior Calls, I'm with Stoyer at Savannah Hernandez.
[1:51:37.000 --> 1:51:53.000]  We're taking about the age studio and then another special guest.
[1:52:08.000 --> 1:52:12.000]  Talk about psychotic, talk about creepy, talk about crazy,
[1:52:12.000 --> 1:52:18.000]  but they need an event like COVID-19 to teach a mammal to wear some covering over its nose,
[1:52:18.000 --> 1:52:23.000]  over its breathing tubes to set the precedent for the forced inoculations,
[1:52:23.000 --> 1:52:29.000]  for the GMO, for the 5G, and for all the things that they admit will end our humanity as we know it.
[1:52:29.000 --> 1:52:31.000]  That's why this is so evil.
[1:52:31.000 --> 1:52:38.000]  The whole agenda for cashless society, global government, UN control, getting us all into debt,
[1:52:38.000 --> 1:52:40.000]  getting rid of local government.
[1:52:40.000 --> 1:52:45.000]  Think about all the facets of it, the censorship, the surveillance.
[1:52:45.000 --> 1:52:48.000]  I have never been so concerned about what's going on.
[1:52:48.000 --> 1:52:51.000]  This is all martial law prepping, martial law training,
[1:52:51.000 --> 1:52:54.000]  and now they have activated the most criminal elements to deep state,
[1:52:54.000 --> 1:52:59.000]  and Pelosi is bragging they're going to remove the president illegally with COG.
[1:52:59.000 --> 1:53:01.000]  They're not going to remove the president with COG.
[1:53:01.000 --> 1:53:04.000]  They're going to remove the president, 25th Amendment or impeachment,
[1:53:04.000 --> 1:53:06.000]  but they're saying they're going to do it.
[1:53:06.000 --> 1:53:09.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, they are putting this in every newspaper in the country
[1:53:09.000 --> 1:53:13.000]  and legitimizing the fact that if he contests the election in any way,
[1:53:13.000 --> 1:53:16.000]  when they say by default they are, they're going to pull this.
[1:53:16.000 --> 1:53:18.000]  This is maximum, maximum alert.
[1:53:18.000 --> 1:53:20.000]  This is emergency alert.
[1:53:20.000 --> 1:53:22.000]  Yes, they've censored the Patriots off most of the internet,
[1:53:22.000 --> 1:53:25.000]  but banned our video is still there, the radio show is still there,
[1:53:25.000 --> 1:53:28.000]  and yes, we're getting about five times the traffic we were getting before the ban to the actual sites,
[1:53:28.000 --> 1:53:32.000]  but we need to get this message to other people outside of our audience.
[1:53:32.000 --> 1:53:36.000]  So tell everyone now about the martial law plan and the plan to get rid of Trump.
[1:53:36.000 --> 1:53:39.000]  It's all posted at banned.video. Please.
[1:53:39.000 --> 1:53:41.000]  We can defeat these people if you take action.
[1:53:41.000 --> 1:54:02.000]  You are the answer. Please, please, please.
[1:54:02.000 --> 1:54:06.000]  You know, I think that's part of it is no one will really write about all this.
[1:54:06.000 --> 1:54:09.000]  I mean, I studied the globalist writings and I knew they were planning all this,
[1:54:09.000 --> 1:54:13.000]  but to actually see them implemented all and to know it's about to get a lot worse.
[1:54:13.000 --> 1:54:16.000]  Here's the thing, we've gone off the edge of the cliff.
[1:54:16.000 --> 1:54:18.000]  Everything else was the buildup to that.
[1:54:18.000 --> 1:54:23.000]  And I just pray to God to heal this land and for the world to wake up and say no,
[1:54:23.000 --> 1:54:25.000]  because the road we're going down is so horrible.
[1:54:25.000 --> 1:54:30.000]  But every time I look at my three-year-old daughter or my other children,
[1:54:30.000 --> 1:54:37.000]  I marvel that people would join Satan willingly and would be so stupid.
[1:54:37.000 --> 1:54:40.000]  I think that's really what upsets me the most.
[1:54:40.000 --> 1:54:47.000]  And I just feel like I need to renaissance what I'm doing,
[1:54:47.000 --> 1:54:52.000]  and I need to get aggressive in a nonviolent way.
[1:54:52.000 --> 1:54:56.000]  That means right up to the edge of that,
[1:54:56.000 --> 1:55:01.000]  to put the fear of God into these scumbags that are doing this to us.
[1:55:01.000 --> 1:55:06.000]  I mean, Bill Gates is saying, I'm coming with a vaccine that's going to kill and hurt a bunch of people,
[1:55:06.000 --> 1:55:08.000]  and they're going to take it.
[1:55:08.000 --> 1:55:11.000]  Imagine if I said, hey, I cooked something up in my garage, Gates,
[1:55:11.000 --> 1:55:13.000]  I'm going to come stick an evil in you and make you take it.
[1:55:13.000 --> 1:55:15.000]  They'd have SWAT teams attacking you, and they should.
[1:55:15.000 --> 1:55:20.000]  But this little crazy man, he's paid everybody off because he wants in my body
[1:55:20.000 --> 1:55:24.000]  and he hangs out with a child molester, Jeffrey Epstein.
[1:55:24.000 --> 1:55:27.000]  You know one of molest children, folks, he's into the blackmail of scientists.
[1:55:27.000 --> 1:55:32.000]  He wants power over humans to turn us into a frankened food
[1:55:32.000 --> 1:55:35.000]  with their DNA vaccine that changes your cells.
[1:55:35.000 --> 1:55:37.000]  You know, I was telling Stephen Crowder this today, he's a smart guy.
[1:55:37.000 --> 1:55:40.000]  He goes, really, they've got a vaccine that changes your DNA.
[1:55:40.000 --> 1:55:42.000]  And I said, yes, Stephen, they do.
[1:55:42.000 --> 1:55:45.000]  It's like when I'd say they were having animal human clones 20 years ago.
[1:55:45.000 --> 1:55:47.000]  It's in the mainline literature.
[1:55:47.000 --> 1:55:51.000]  Now people go, oh my God, it's true, but let's just move on from it.
[1:55:51.000 --> 1:55:54.000]  Like there's three million Uighurs in death camps.
[1:55:54.000 --> 1:55:58.000]  Like, oh, there's three million in death camps, but 14 black guys got killed by cops.
[1:55:58.000 --> 1:56:01.000]  Let's obsess over that and burn the country down.
[1:56:01.000 --> 1:56:03.000]  And then meanwhile, they're killing millions of blacks in abortion.
[1:56:03.000 --> 1:56:05.000]  We don't care about that.
[1:56:05.000 --> 1:56:07.000]  14 black guys died.
[1:56:07.000 --> 1:56:09.000]  It's just all a sick joke.
[1:56:19.000 --> 1:56:21.000]  So your calls were shut up.
[1:56:24.000 --> 1:56:27.000]  Mike in California, thanks for holding on to here.
[1:56:28.000 --> 1:56:30.000]  Alex, I love you.
[1:56:30.000 --> 1:56:33.000]  I've been listening to you for every single day for years now.
[1:56:33.000 --> 1:56:39.000]  And I discovered you from Davis, Spain, and from Billy Corgan interviews, actually.
[1:56:39.000 --> 1:56:42.000]  And then I started checking you out and I got woken up.
[1:56:42.000 --> 1:56:44.000]  I just want plugged really quick.
[1:56:44.000 --> 1:56:49.000]  X2, turbo force, the real red pill.
[1:56:49.000 --> 1:56:52.000]  And then I just took DNA force for the first time and it was amazing.
[1:56:52.000 --> 1:56:55.000]  So anyways, I'm locked and loaded.
[1:56:55.000 --> 1:56:57.000]  I got a point for you here today.
[1:56:57.000 --> 1:57:09.000]  The first point I wanted to make is back in 1908, there was a meeting between intelligence and press people called the Empire Press Corps back in 1908.
[1:57:09.000 --> 1:57:14.000]  This was a globalist consortium where they basically said, okay, this is what we need to do.
[1:57:14.000 --> 1:57:21.000]  We need to control the narrative airtight and we need to control all the media in order to do that.
[1:57:21.000 --> 1:57:31.000]  And then so you look at that back in 1908, and then you look at Julian Huxley, who you mentioned a couple days ago on the show,
[1:57:31.000 --> 1:57:34.000]  talking about the globalist plan.
[1:57:34.000 --> 1:57:41.000]  And what makes me bring this up is that you have to supplant the word globalist with Satan.
[1:57:41.000 --> 1:57:45.000]  Because this isn't a man that's doing this, obviously.
[1:57:45.000 --> 1:57:49.000]  I mean, we're talking 1908, we're talking Julian Huxley was saying that back in the 40s.
[1:57:49.000 --> 1:57:52.000]  You know, this is such a long period of time.
[1:57:52.000 --> 1:57:55.000]  This is taking control of these people.
[1:57:55.000 --> 1:57:56.000]  Right.
[1:57:56.000 --> 1:57:57.000]  I totally agree with you.
[1:57:57.000 --> 1:58:00.000]  I use the term globalist because that's what they were calling themselves 60 years ago.
[1:58:00.000 --> 1:58:03.000]  They want global government so you can't escape.
[1:58:03.000 --> 1:58:05.000]  Globalism is just to get the control.
[1:58:05.000 --> 1:58:08.000]  Planetary rule is just for the control.
[1:58:08.000 --> 1:58:10.000]  What comes after it is pure Satanism.
[1:58:10.000 --> 1:58:11.000]  You're absolutely right.
[1:58:11.000 --> 1:58:12.000]  No, you're right.
[1:58:12.000 --> 1:58:14.000]  And you and you have been on it.
[1:58:14.000 --> 1:58:18.000]  And I'm talking to the Godfather who woke me up.
[1:58:18.000 --> 1:58:19.000]  Let me tell you this.
[1:58:19.000 --> 1:58:21.000]  I'm not the Godfather or anything.
[1:58:21.000 --> 1:58:23.000]  I'm just somebody that doesn't want to be a slave.
[1:58:23.000 --> 1:58:24.000]  But I don't need to.
[1:58:24.000 --> 1:58:25.000]  But here's the thing.
[1:58:25.000 --> 1:58:27.000]  People need to know this is all been out there before.
[1:58:27.000 --> 1:58:29.000]  But now we're going to live through it.
[1:58:29.000 --> 1:58:30.000]  What do you think of that?
[1:58:30.000 --> 1:58:32.000]  Well, no, so that's my point.
[1:58:32.000 --> 1:58:35.000]  My next point was you had a guest on recently.
[1:58:35.000 --> 1:58:36.000]  Hold on.
[1:58:36.000 --> 1:58:38.000]  We got Owen Schreuer and Savannah Hernandez coming in.
[1:58:38.000 --> 1:58:39.000]  They're going to cover stuff.
[1:58:39.000 --> 1:58:40.000]  But we're going to get to everybody.
[1:58:40.000 --> 1:58:41.000]  Mike will finish up with you.
[1:58:41.000 --> 1:58:44.000]  Nicholas Wild and Joe will get to everyone of you before the sour ends.
[1:58:44.000 --> 1:58:46.000]  And then another guest host is coming up.
[1:58:46.000 --> 1:58:47.000]  Who's doing the fourth hour today?
[1:58:47.000 --> 1:58:48.000]  Let me tell you who's doing that.
[1:58:48.000 --> 1:58:49.000]  John Rattlemore.
[1:58:49.000 --> 1:58:52.000]  Oh, that'll be good.
[1:58:52.000 --> 1:58:56.000]  The reasons that the globalist launch this planetary lockdown.
[1:58:56.000 --> 1:59:00.000]  The number one reason is it serves every one of their purposes.
[1:59:00.000 --> 1:59:05.000]  We've gone over those purposes many times here on air.
[1:59:05.000 --> 1:59:09.000]  The cashless society, the surveillance system, global government, medical
[1:59:09.000 --> 1:59:11.000]  tyranny, forced inoculation.
[1:59:11.000 --> 1:59:15.000]  But the most important facet is it teaches us that we are obsolete,
[1:59:15.000 --> 1:59:21.000]  obsolete, that we are non-essential as we begin to witness automation
[1:59:21.000 --> 1:59:27.000]  computers and robots take over the jobs that people once had by design.
[1:59:27.000 --> 1:59:31.000]  This isn't like it's some advancement that we just fell into.
[1:59:31.000 --> 1:59:34.000]  It's been preplanned, organized globally.
[1:59:34.000 --> 1:59:36.000]  And it's extremely predatory.
[1:59:36.000 --> 1:59:41.000]  And through governmental actuaries and tax programs and regulations,
[1:59:41.000 --> 1:59:45.000]  the central banks that control it all are able to pick the winners
[1:59:45.000 --> 1:59:48.000]  and the losers and consolidate power.
[1:59:48.000 --> 1:59:52.000]  This is the truest form of technocracy fascism.
[1:59:56.000 --> 2:00:02.000]  This program contains language and sequences some viewers may find disturbing.
[2:00:02.000 --> 2:00:06.000]  The nation and all of our freedoms hang by a thread.
[2:00:06.000 --> 2:00:09.000]  And the military apparatus of this country is about to be handed over to
[2:00:09.000 --> 2:00:14.000]  SCUM, more beholden to SCUM, the Russian SCUM.
[2:00:20.000 --> 2:00:22.000]  Listen, please listen.
[2:00:22.000 --> 2:00:27.000]  If you don't, if you won't, if you fail to understand,
[2:00:27.000 --> 2:00:31.000]  then the same incredible terror that's menacing me will strike at you!
[2:00:31.000 --> 2:00:35.000]  The function of all life is survival.
[2:00:35.000 --> 2:00:40.000]  Sleep, sleep, sleep.
[2:00:43.000 --> 2:00:45.000]  They're coming, they're coming!
[2:00:45.000 --> 2:00:47.000]  Help, help! They're coming!
[2:00:47.000 --> 2:00:49.000]  They're coming! Listen to me!
[2:00:49.000 --> 2:00:51.000]  Listen, help me!
[2:00:51.000 --> 2:00:54.000]  Your next, please, please, your next, they're in danger.
[2:00:54.000 --> 2:00:56.000]  Please, listen to me, it's something terrible.
[2:00:56.000 --> 2:00:58.000]  Please, your next, here they are!
[2:00:58.000 --> 2:01:00.000]  They're already here!
[2:01:00.000 --> 2:01:02.000]  Help, your next!
[2:01:02.000 --> 2:01:04.000]  They're coming, they're coming!
[2:01:04.000 --> 2:01:05.000]  Sleep.
[2:01:05.000 --> 2:01:06.000]  The seed is planted.
[2:01:06.000 --> 2:01:09.000]  Sleep, sleep.
[2:01:09.000 --> 2:01:11.000]  Terror grows.
[2:01:11.000 --> 2:01:12.000]  Elizabeth, wake up!
[2:01:12.000 --> 2:01:14.000]  I'll get you when you sleep!
[2:01:14.000 --> 2:01:15.000]  Sit up!
[2:01:15.000 --> 2:01:19.000]  Invasion of the body snatchers.
[2:01:19.000 --> 2:01:21.000]  All of a sudden, they're growing like parasites.
[2:01:21.000 --> 2:01:23.000]  Is it contagious?
[2:01:23.000 --> 2:01:25.000]  It's real, it's real, it's real.
[2:01:25.000 --> 2:01:26.000]  It looked right at me.
[2:01:26.000 --> 2:01:27.000]  You need to get out.
[2:01:27.000 --> 2:01:29.000]  You're looking at it as if it was human or was not human.
[2:01:29.000 --> 2:01:34.000]  Now, the classic fear begins to grow.
[2:01:34.000 --> 2:01:36.000]  We're being cornered.
[2:01:36.000 --> 2:01:40.000]  In a modern masterpiece of science fiction.
[2:01:40.000 --> 2:01:42.000]  Ibarricating the street.
[2:01:42.000 --> 2:01:45.000]  Invasion of the body snatchers.
[2:01:45.000 --> 2:01:48.000]  Elizabeth, don't go walking dead!
[2:01:48.000 --> 2:02:11.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[2:02:11.000 --> 2:02:16.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[2:02:16.000 --> 2:02:19.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, there is so much to cover
[2:02:19.000 --> 2:02:21.000]  and so many calls to get to.
[2:02:21.000 --> 2:02:24.000]  Let's finish up with Mike in California.
[2:02:24.000 --> 2:02:26.000]  And then we will get to Savannah Hernandez
[2:02:26.000 --> 2:02:29.000]  and I'll ensure that they're in studio with us here in just a moment.
[2:02:29.000 --> 2:02:31.000]  Mike, I'm finishing up your points on spiritual war.
[2:02:31.000 --> 2:02:32.000]  It's taking place.
[2:02:32.000 --> 2:02:35.000]  That is exactly what's going on.
[2:02:35.000 --> 2:02:37.000]  Yeah, thank you.
[2:02:37.000 --> 2:02:42.000]  So, you had a guess on a few...
[2:02:42.000 --> 2:02:43.000]  You're a little muffled now.
[2:02:43.000 --> 2:02:46.000]  Move your hand away from the telephone.
[2:02:46.000 --> 2:02:47.000]  Okay.
[2:02:47.000 --> 2:02:48.000]  Can you hear me okay now?
[2:02:48.000 --> 2:02:49.000]  I hear you better.
[2:02:49.000 --> 2:02:50.000]  Yeah, go ahead.
[2:02:50.000 --> 2:02:51.000]  Okay.
[2:02:51.000 --> 2:02:53.000]  So, you had a guess on a couple of weeks ago named Bishop Gators.
[2:02:53.000 --> 2:02:54.000]  Yeah, he's a good guy.
[2:02:54.000 --> 2:02:55.000]  People like him.
[2:02:55.000 --> 2:02:56.000]  Oh, awesome.
[2:02:56.000 --> 2:02:57.000]  Yeah.
[2:02:57.000 --> 2:03:01.000]  So, I listened to a podcast with him a couple of days ago with a doctor.
[2:03:01.000 --> 2:03:04.000]  And he was talking about this nanotechnical...
[2:03:04.000 --> 2:03:06.000]  Bill Gates wants to inject in everybody.
[2:03:06.000 --> 2:03:09.000]  That's going to be communicating with Wi-Fi towers and everything.
[2:03:09.000 --> 2:03:11.000]  And it's called Hydrogeo.
[2:03:11.000 --> 2:03:18.000]  And he was breaking down that Hydrogeo, translated in Latin, literally translates to Lucifer.
[2:03:18.000 --> 2:03:24.000]  And it actually is going to change your DNA and turn you into a Luciferian being.
[2:03:24.000 --> 2:03:26.000]  So, I mean...
[2:03:26.000 --> 2:03:27.000]  Sir, I was telling...
[2:03:27.000 --> 2:03:37.000]  I was telling even Crowder this today, Bill Gates on record on PBS shows says we're developing
[2:03:37.000 --> 2:03:41.000]  this nanotech that's injected into you Hydrogeo is this one part of it.
[2:03:41.000 --> 2:03:43.000]  And so, when they give you the vaccine, it's got it.
[2:03:43.000 --> 2:03:45.000]  So, it's little micro crystals.
[2:03:45.000 --> 2:03:47.000]  It's so miniaturized, the chips now.
[2:03:47.000 --> 2:03:49.000]  It has record that you took the shot.
[2:03:49.000 --> 2:03:50.000]  That's the digital tattoos.
[2:03:50.000 --> 2:03:53.000]  But then Gates will come out and say, oh, it's not true, even though it's funny.
[2:03:53.000 --> 2:03:57.000]  Look at this official social distancing sign.
[2:03:57.000 --> 2:03:58.000]  666.
[2:03:58.000 --> 2:04:00.000]  All that is is six degrees of separation.
[2:04:00.000 --> 2:04:03.000]  It's this mathematics code that we're all connected to each other.
[2:04:03.000 --> 2:04:04.000]  666.
[2:04:04.000 --> 2:04:05.000]  So, they talk about Margaret the Beast.
[2:04:05.000 --> 2:04:08.000]  All of this is the same thing over and over again.
[2:04:08.000 --> 2:04:11.000]  The bar code operates off of 666.
[2:04:11.000 --> 2:04:14.000]  The computer codes are all 666.
[2:04:14.000 --> 2:04:15.000]  And so, yes.
[2:04:15.000 --> 2:04:21.000]  And then Gates has patents where once you've had the vaccine, you have a digital tattoo.
[2:04:21.000 --> 2:04:25.000]  First phase is a bracelet or an iPhone app that proves you've had it.
[2:04:25.000 --> 2:04:27.000]  And now Singapore and China are doing it.
[2:04:27.000 --> 2:04:30.000]  And now the Democrats are announcing it for school kids to go to school.
[2:04:30.000 --> 2:04:33.000]  You'll have a bracelet showing that you've had it.
[2:04:33.000 --> 2:04:37.000]  And this is all official from Rice University, from MIT.
[2:04:37.000 --> 2:04:41.000]  And they say on their own promos, Bill Gates funded us to develop this.
[2:04:41.000 --> 2:04:42.000]  We have it.
[2:04:42.000 --> 2:04:43.000]  Then we cover it.
[2:04:43.000 --> 2:04:48.000]  They come out in the news and say it's not real.
[2:04:48.000 --> 2:04:53.000]  So, so then what I did was I read the Bible every single night, right?
[2:04:53.000 --> 2:04:56.000]  And I'm praying to God and I'm getting right with God.
[2:04:56.000 --> 2:04:59.000]  Like, you know, you say it all the time, get right with God.
[2:04:59.000 --> 2:05:03.000]  This is a time for everyone to be obeying God diligently reading the Bible.
[2:05:03.000 --> 2:05:08.000]  So I was reading the Bible after I listened to that Larry Gator's podcast.
[2:05:08.000 --> 2:05:10.000]  I think it was last night.
[2:05:10.000 --> 2:05:13.000]  And I just happened to be, I read a Psalm every night.
[2:05:13.000 --> 2:05:16.000]  Now I happen to be on Psalm number 37.
[2:05:16.000 --> 2:05:24.000]  And Psalm number 37 begins with don't fret because of evil doers for they will be cut down like the grass.
[2:05:24.000 --> 2:05:30.000]  And so that really, that touched my spirit because I wasn't afraid.
[2:05:30.000 --> 2:05:38.000]  And I wasn't feeling like this need for me to do anything that pray to God and give up to God.
[2:05:38.000 --> 2:05:40.000]  God is the one who's going to go fight the battle.
[2:05:40.000 --> 2:05:42.000]  You know, think about Gideon with 300 men.
[2:05:42.000 --> 2:05:45.000]  They faced an army of over a million men.
[2:05:45.000 --> 2:05:54.000]  Think about, you know, when the Israelites were about to go off to war,
[2:05:54.000 --> 2:05:56.000]  God would go and fight the battle for him.
[2:05:56.000 --> 2:06:00.000]  Like when the Egyptians were closing in, hailstones were coming down on him.
[2:06:00.000 --> 2:06:04.000]  And the wagons, the wheels were coming off of the carts and stuff like that.
[2:06:04.000 --> 2:06:07.000]  God goes and fights the battles for us.
[2:06:07.000 --> 2:06:09.000]  That's something that we need to get in tune with.
[2:06:09.000 --> 2:06:11.000]  I know a lot of your audience is Christian.
[2:06:11.000 --> 2:06:16.000]  We need to start really getting in tune with the fact that God is going to go before us and fight this battle.
[2:06:16.000 --> 2:06:19.000]  We're not going to have to take this shot from Bill Gates.
[2:06:19.000 --> 2:06:21.000]  We're not going to have to take this death shot.
[2:06:21.000 --> 2:06:23.000]  Trump is going to get reelected.
[2:06:23.000 --> 2:06:25.000]  We're going to emerge victorious.
[2:06:25.000 --> 2:06:28.000]  And the wicked are going to perish like the grass.
[2:06:28.000 --> 2:06:32.000]  And, you know, that was the message that I just wanted to convey today.
[2:06:32.000 --> 2:06:33.000]  All right. God bless you.
[2:06:33.000 --> 2:06:36.000]  And I hear what you're saying, Mike, but trust in God, type your cammo,
[2:06:36.000 --> 2:06:41.000]  or Hunter S. Thompson, pray to God, but Roy from the Rocks, but I hear you, I think if we do the right thing, God will give us Providence.
[2:06:41.000 --> 2:06:45.000]  Owen Schreuer, Sven Hernandez, what do you think about the spiritual battle?
[2:06:45.000 --> 2:06:50.000]  Well, every time that we go out, it's like a drift is on.
[2:06:50.000 --> 2:06:52.000]  Yeah, they turned it on now. Go ahead.
[2:06:52.000 --> 2:06:57.000]  Well, I think it's very apparent, the spiritual battle, when we go out and you just have a trump hat on
[2:06:57.000 --> 2:07:01.000]  or a trump shirt or anything, or an infowars shirt, and it just triggers a reaction.
[2:07:01.000 --> 2:07:06.000]  Like I went out in the armored truck today and I wasn't saying anything controversial.
[2:07:06.000 --> 2:07:13.000]  Really, I was just laying out facts about the Communist Chinese and people just drive by and they just flick me off and they just say F you.
[2:07:13.000 --> 2:07:15.000]  That's that's not a human thing.
[2:07:15.000 --> 2:07:18.000]  Well, when you would say USA, they would do it.
[2:07:18.000 --> 2:07:21.000]  That's another triggering are an American flag.
[2:07:21.000 --> 2:07:29.000]  It's just all these triggering symbols that they've been taught are evil and they just have a program condition response, but that's not a human thing.
[2:07:29.000 --> 2:07:32.000]  It's not human to respond that way.
[2:07:32.000 --> 2:07:36.000]  It's not human to not be able to think for yourself and think logically and not be hateful.
[2:07:36.000 --> 2:07:38.000]  They really all act as one though.
[2:07:38.000 --> 2:07:46.000]  It is. It's a demonic frequency that they're all operating on and the first initial reaction driven by hate is just it's always violent.
[2:07:46.000 --> 2:07:48.000]  It's always vitriolic.
[2:07:48.000 --> 2:07:50.000]  And yeah, that's just one example.
[2:07:50.000 --> 2:07:57.000]  I mean, look, I don't I'm not proud of the fact I have to go out and report news in an armored truck because I have people to come up and, you know, try to stab me.
[2:07:57.000 --> 2:08:00.000]  But that's that's how it is.
[2:08:00.000 --> 2:08:02.000]  So that's what we do now.
[2:08:02.000 --> 2:08:05.000]  Savannah completely agree, Alex.
[2:08:05.000 --> 2:08:08.000]  I mean, you can't even go out on the street without being attacked anymore.
[2:08:08.000 --> 2:08:10.000]  And you call this a spiritual battle.
[2:08:10.000 --> 2:08:12.000]  And I think that's exactly what this is.
[2:08:12.000 --> 2:08:14.000]  We're seeing degeneracy in the streets.
[2:08:14.000 --> 2:08:19.000]  We're seeing the LGBTQ whole entire initiative being pushed on children.
[2:08:19.000 --> 2:08:21.000]  Oh, yeah, it's not about Oh, let us get married.
[2:08:21.000 --> 2:08:23.000]  Now it's about we're going to teach your kid.
[2:08:23.000 --> 2:08:28.000]  Exactly. We have Black Lives Matter painted across our town as well, our city as well.
[2:08:28.000 --> 2:08:31.000]  And we're constantly getting all of this stuff pushed in our faces.
[2:08:31.000 --> 2:08:34.000]  And notice the more we submit and then they want everything.
[2:08:34.000 --> 2:08:37.000]  Exactly. Exactly, Alex.
[2:08:37.000 --> 2:08:38.000]  What do you think it's going?
[2:08:38.000 --> 2:08:40.000]  You know, Alex, I really don't know.
[2:08:40.000 --> 2:08:46.000]  I mean, I've been in politics now for what about two years ever since I started working here and watching all of this unfold.
[2:08:46.000 --> 2:08:47.000]  I don't know where it's going.
[2:08:47.000 --> 2:08:53.000]  I'm really hoping that we've swung so far left that people start waking up and we go right again.
[2:08:53.000 --> 2:08:58.000]  People start realizing that we've come so far that we, you know, need to go back and that's what ends up.
[2:08:58.000 --> 2:09:00.000]  And you were hired to work just on the shows.
[2:09:00.000 --> 2:09:01.000]  You did a great job.
[2:09:01.000 --> 2:09:05.000]  But I would call it your radicalization, your education, seeing it from the inside.
[2:09:05.000 --> 2:09:06.000]  We're not exaggerating.
[2:09:06.000 --> 2:09:07.000]  Exactly.
[2:09:07.000 --> 2:09:09.000]  And that's the thing too, Alex.
[2:09:09.000 --> 2:09:14.000]  I went out on the street and I actually experienced all of the things that you talk about on the show.
[2:09:14.000 --> 2:09:16.000]  And I actually saw them for myself.
[2:09:16.000 --> 2:09:22.000]  I don't like coming on air and talking about things that I haven't experienced, which is why I go out and I go and protest for police lies,
[2:09:22.000 --> 2:09:25.000]  which is why I've gone and talked to Ntifa and VLM members.
[2:09:25.000 --> 2:09:31.000]  And when we say that these people are hateful, vitriolic and degenerate, we're not exaggerating in the slightest.
[2:09:31.000 --> 2:09:33.000]  Well, why'd you have to make that girl cry like that?
[2:09:33.000 --> 2:09:34.000]  No, she hit you.
[2:09:34.000 --> 2:09:36.000]  All she did was attack you and assault you.
[2:09:36.000 --> 2:09:37.000]  Why'd you have to make her cry?
[2:09:37.000 --> 2:09:38.000]  And then it's larping, though.
[2:09:38.000 --> 2:09:39.000]  I'm not badgering.
[2:09:39.000 --> 2:09:40.000]  As soon as you hit her back, she starts crying.
[2:09:40.000 --> 2:09:41.000]  It's like, yeah.
[2:09:41.000 --> 2:09:45.000]  It's like when the Antifa attacks the lady and they stab her, they're like, yeah, we fight back.
[2:09:45.000 --> 2:09:46.000]  Police?
[2:09:46.000 --> 2:09:47.000]  Oh, where are the police?
[2:09:47.000 --> 2:09:48.000]  Defund the police.
[2:09:48.000 --> 2:09:49.000]  Oh, I need the police.
[2:09:49.000 --> 2:09:57.000]  I'm really, really proud of the Dr. Jones naturals, activated charcoal, naturally fluoride free, mouthwash and toothpaste.
[2:09:57.000 --> 2:10:05.000]  And if you don't know what activated charcoal does, ladies and gentlemen, it naturally, in a clean way, strips away the toxins, the impurities, the plaque.

[2:10:34.000 --> 2:10:40.000]  Over a year ago, I tried charcoal toothpaste for major brand and thought it was amazing.
[2:10:40.000 --> 2:10:42.000]  And I went to my dad and people said, I would like to put out a charcoal toothpaste.
[2:10:42.000 --> 2:10:45.000]  It doesn't have all the silica and all these fillers and a very strong toothpaste.

[2:12:01.000 --> 2:12:07.000]  Let me tell you how it went.
[2:12:07.000 --> 2:12:11.000]  All right, Owen Schreuer and Savannah Hernandez here right at the shotgun with Alex Jones, your host.
[2:12:11.000 --> 2:12:13.000]  And Owen has breaking news right now.
[2:12:13.000 --> 2:12:23.000]  That's right, Alex, the president of the United States, who they have once before called the InfoWars president, has just tweeted out,
[2:12:23.000 --> 2:12:28.000]  big news, the political crime of the century is unfolding.
[2:12:28.000 --> 2:12:34.000]  Obama-Biden illegally spied on the Trump campaign before and after the election.
[2:12:34.000 --> 2:12:36.000]  Trees in.
[2:12:36.000 --> 2:12:44.000]  Yeah, that's the Sally Yates acting attorney general at the time hearing where she's changing her story around a bunch.
[2:12:44.000 --> 2:12:50.000]  But if Durham and them don't act, or this other Texas special investigator, what does it matter?
[2:12:50.000 --> 2:12:55.000]  It's like Tucker Carlson says, this becomes like this theater of political porn where we hear about it.
[2:12:55.000 --> 2:13:05.000]  Oh, two weeks, you know, I mean, well, I hope that the president has a true desire and will to have justice come through here with the trees
[2:13:05.000 --> 2:13:07.000]  and from Obama and the others.
[2:13:07.000 --> 2:13:10.000]  Maybe Durham doesn't, maybe Bill Barr doesn't, but I hope at least the president does.
[2:13:10.000 --> 2:13:12.000]  Well, there is some positive news.
[2:13:12.000 --> 2:13:15.000]  She threw coming under the bus and said he went rogue.
[2:13:15.000 --> 2:13:19.000]  Well, and they're all going to end up throwing Obama under the bus if they haven't already.
[2:13:19.000 --> 2:13:22.000]  I'd say the consolation prize is Obama looks really scared.
[2:13:22.000 --> 2:13:24.000]  The scandal-free president.
[2:13:24.000 --> 2:13:27.000]  The scandal-free president, they said.
[2:13:27.000 --> 2:13:29.000]  The scandal-free president.
[2:13:29.000 --> 2:13:31.000]  Yeah, not so much anymore.
[2:13:31.000 --> 2:13:33.000]  There he is.
[2:13:33.000 --> 2:13:35.000]  This is going.
[2:13:35.000 --> 2:13:45.000]  Well, I hope before the election, I expect that President Trump has a few October surprises up his sleeve.
[2:13:45.000 --> 2:13:53.000]  If he really is in this like he does his own business deals, and you can kind of read about it in the art of the deal then,
[2:13:53.000 --> 2:14:00.000]  he knows what they did to him in October of 2016 when they released the Billy Bush tape and they did some other shenanigans.
[2:14:00.000 --> 2:14:03.000]  I don't think President Trump had anything to do with Julian Assange,
[2:14:03.000 --> 2:14:08.000]  but Assange did come out with the WikiLeaks that showed Hillary Clinton and the Podestas do the spirit cooking,
[2:14:08.000 --> 2:14:10.000]  Satanic stuff that they were involved in.
[2:14:10.000 --> 2:14:14.000]  So those were the two October surprises from 2016.
[2:14:14.000 --> 2:14:20.000]  Now that Trump has been involved in politics for four years, he's not dumb.
[2:14:20.000 --> 2:14:25.000]  He understands the October surprise, and my guess is he's going to have an October surprise of his own.
[2:14:25.000 --> 2:14:33.000]  And maybe that's, you know, we get to see Biden getting the perp walk for illegally spying or for the Ukraine gate or for the.
[2:14:33.000 --> 2:14:36.000]  They're not going to arrest Biden during the middle of an election.
[2:14:36.000 --> 2:14:40.000]  So they got plenty on the chai-com angle.
[2:14:40.000 --> 2:14:43.000]  The Democrats being chai-com agents is to get Chinese money.
[2:14:43.000 --> 2:14:50.000]  You've got to actually have a chai-com in your office so they can destroy them all for espionage with the communist Chinese right now.
[2:14:50.000 --> 2:14:55.000]  The problem is so many Republicans were involved, to a lesser extent, but still involved, that they don't want to upset the apple cart.
[2:14:55.000 --> 2:15:00.000]  They want the Democrats to just give up, but they're not. Savannah, what do you think is going to happen to this election?
[2:15:00.000 --> 2:15:05.000]  Well, Alex, it's very interesting to see too that Joe Biden has been hiding for the past couple of months.
[2:15:05.000 --> 2:15:09.000]  They're now saying that there should be no debates between Joe Biden and President Trump.
[2:15:09.000 --> 2:15:16.000]  And of course, the whole way that Joe Biden is going to win this election or try to is by hiding, is by staying out of plain sight,
[2:15:16.000 --> 2:15:22.000]  is by staying out of the news media because every single time he gets on air, he says something new and crazy,
[2:15:22.000 --> 2:15:26.000]  and people just realize more and more how much his mind has deteriorated.
[2:15:26.000 --> 2:15:32.000]  So, I mean, I don't see how Donald Trump could lose just because he's going up against Joe Biden,
[2:15:32.000 --> 2:15:37.000]  but I really don't know because, you know, back in 2016, everyone was saying the same thing about Donald Trump winning.
[2:15:37.000 --> 2:15:39.000]  So now they couldn't say how he's going to win.
[2:15:39.000 --> 2:15:43.000]  Well, clearly he's a placeholder and they'll probably try to remove him or something.
[2:15:43.000 --> 2:15:46.000]  They wanted to do it once he got in office, but now they know he's deteriorating too fast.
[2:15:46.000 --> 2:15:51.000]  He could probably die and they just say, well, he's in hiding as a terrorist. He can't come out or something.
[2:15:51.000 --> 2:15:58.000]  I mean, we're about to see spectacular garbage because everything the New World Order has done is failing right now,
[2:15:58.000 --> 2:16:02.000]  but they still have the power of the media and the purse, so they think they can get away with it.
[2:16:02.000 --> 2:16:05.000]  So this is spectacularly dangerous.
[2:16:05.000 --> 2:16:09.000]  Yeah, the fake pandemic isn't going over how they wanted it to.
[2:16:09.000 --> 2:16:15.000]  They're fake hate crimes of Jussie Smollett and Bubba Wallace both failed.
[2:16:15.000 --> 2:16:22.000]  It's now, I mean, it's not going to reach enough eyes, but the George Floyd arrest has been made public
[2:16:22.000 --> 2:16:25.000]  and people are going to see, wow, the media lied about that too.
[2:16:25.000 --> 2:16:30.000]  And you know what, Owen, can I just jump in real quick because the body cam footage did come out for George Floyd yesterday
[2:16:30.000 --> 2:16:37.000]  and we have a local BLM leader. His name is King here and he's the one where I always go to his events and somehow get attacked.
[2:16:37.000 --> 2:16:42.000]  He actually talked with Steven Crowder yesterday, but he came up to me and he was asking me about George Floyd
[2:16:42.000 --> 2:16:46.000]  and I said, well, did you watch the body cam footage? And he said, what body cam footage?
[2:16:46.000 --> 2:16:49.000]  And I was like, it was released today. George Floyd himself asked to lie on the ground.
[2:16:49.000 --> 2:16:55.000]  He didn't believe me and three other people around me said, George Floyd did not ask to be put on the ground.
[2:16:55.000 --> 2:16:57.000]  George Floyd was not on drugs.
[2:16:57.000 --> 2:17:02.000]  It's very sad. He's bombed out of his brain saying, I can't breathe, I'm dying in the back of the car.
[2:17:02.000 --> 2:17:09.000]  So we have the evidence now, Alex, about this George Floyd case to completely debunk everything that BLM has been marching for.
[2:17:09.000 --> 2:17:14.000]  But these BLM leaders are so set in their way that they refuse to even watch this body cam footage.
[2:17:14.000 --> 2:17:17.000]  They refuse to even educate themselves on what actually happened.
[2:17:17.000 --> 2:17:27.000]  You see, here's why they get so mad. It's a psychological just defense mechanism that they have where imagine a guinea pig in a cage.
[2:17:27.000 --> 2:17:31.000]  The only thing a guinea pig is ever going to eat in that cage is whatever you feed him.
[2:17:31.000 --> 2:17:36.000]  So you could be having a big filet mignon dinner and then you give him a little scrap of cilantro on the top or something.
[2:17:36.000 --> 2:17:38.000]  And so that's all the guinea pig gets.
[2:17:38.000 --> 2:17:44.000]  These BLM people, these Antifa people are guinea pigs in the cage of the fake news.
[2:17:44.000 --> 2:17:50.000]  So they're only going to get what they're given. They never saw the George Floyd tape. They'll never see the George Floyd tape.
[2:17:50.000 --> 2:17:52.000]  But it's worse than that. They want to be delusional.
[2:17:52.000 --> 2:17:57.000]  But it's a defense mechanism. They don't want to know they've been fooled. They don't want to know they've been tricked.
[2:17:57.000 --> 2:18:03.000]  They don't want to think that they're still the slaves. And so they just have a defense mechanism to deny all the evidence,
[2:18:03.000 --> 2:18:07.000]  which, by the way, this was going on when Harriet Tubman was doing the Underground Railroad as well.
[2:18:07.000 --> 2:18:08.000]  I mean, she wrote about this.
[2:18:08.000 --> 2:18:16.000]  But here's the problem. We talk about the dumb minions all day long and the same BLM guy at Stephen Crowder's video that you shot at some man on video
[2:18:16.000 --> 2:18:20.000]  where he goes, well, your information is hurtful, so I'm not going to allow you to have speech.
[2:18:20.000 --> 2:18:25.000]  Crowder's out there trying to have his interviews and get people disagreeing with him.
[2:18:25.000 --> 2:18:30.000]  He goes, no, I'm not letting a discourse happen. No, that's authoritarian. That's what's dangerous.
[2:18:30.000 --> 2:18:38.000]  Exactly. And again, Antifa, the Antifa members and the people in their group are the biggest fascists in this country.
[2:18:38.000 --> 2:18:42.000]  They're, again, like you said, Alex, they're authoritarian. They try to shut down free speech.
[2:18:42.000 --> 2:18:45.000]  They try to shut down our ability to go and protest ourselves.
[2:18:45.000 --> 2:18:50.000]  I mean, that's all these people do. They don't want freedom of speech. They don't want this to be America.
[2:18:50.000 --> 2:18:53.000]  They want this to be Communist China. We've seen that again and again.
[2:18:53.000 --> 2:18:58.000]  I actually have an inside person at these protests who is telling me that the Maoist organization here in Austin, Texas
[2:18:58.000 --> 2:19:05.000]  has been circulating my photos around because they want everyone to know who I am so they can come and silence me at protests
[2:19:05.000 --> 2:19:07.000]  or silence me from reporting from now on.
[2:19:07.000 --> 2:19:09.000]  Now, these are un-American dangerous scum.
[2:19:09.000 --> 2:19:14.000]  Yeah. And, you know, as well, there's another organization called Peace in Austin,
[2:19:14.000 --> 2:19:17.000]  and I just did another report you can find on Action 7 about them.
[2:19:17.000 --> 2:19:21.000]  They're called Peace in Austin. They're an Antifa group who are trying to make spike strips.
[2:19:21.000 --> 2:19:25.000]  They had a building and supply drive the other day that I went to.
[2:19:25.000 --> 2:19:28.000]  They're trying to make spike strips. They're trying to make riot shields.
[2:19:28.000 --> 2:19:30.000]  They're trying to make all of these dangerous weapons.
[2:19:30.000 --> 2:19:37.000]  And, again, they're trying to disguise themselves as peace in Austin when, again, that's not what they are at all.
[2:19:37.000 --> 2:19:42.000]  Well, and just like Soros funded Ukraine earlier, Carlis talked about that.
[2:19:42.000 --> 2:19:45.000]  They had snipers on roof shooting people.
[2:19:45.000 --> 2:19:49.000]  And so now they're saying their next move, Antifa, is to do that.
[2:19:49.000 --> 2:19:54.000]  And our acquiescence, our bowling down the big corporations, our bowling down the sitcoms,
[2:19:54.000 --> 2:19:58.000]  our bowling down the left and letting them take over the universities has elicited this.
[2:19:58.000 --> 2:20:02.000]  Our acquiescence has done this 40 seconds to bring them back with calls.
[2:20:02.000 --> 2:20:05.000]  What do we do, Owen, to stop bowling down?
[2:20:05.000 --> 2:20:11.000]  Well, here's what local leadership and law enforcement needs to understand is that exact paradigm,
[2:20:11.000 --> 2:20:14.000]  it applies to how they handle Antifa and these local militants.
[2:20:14.000 --> 2:20:17.000]  Yeah, the police bow down to BLM and that and all that. It works.
[2:20:17.000 --> 2:20:22.000]  And so, and so, but if you were a conservative or something, you got out, you got her ass for not having max
[2:20:22.000 --> 2:20:24.000]  or you had people arrested for opening the businesses.
[2:20:24.000 --> 2:20:30.000]  But if you have a BLM protest and you burn and loot and the police are told to stand down, then guess what?
[2:20:30.000 --> 2:20:33.000]  They keep coming back. They keep trying to get riled up. They keep getting worse.
[2:20:33.000 --> 2:20:35.000]  And then it doesn't even matter what happened to George Floyd.
[2:20:35.000 --> 2:20:37.000]  It never mattered what happened to George Floyd.
[2:20:37.000 --> 2:20:40.000]  You allowed them to behave like that in the, in the outset.
[2:20:40.000 --> 2:20:43.000]  And so now they just assume that's what they can do whenever they want.
[2:20:43.000 --> 2:20:48.000]  That's right. We'll be back with calls and a lot more to stay with us.
[2:20:48.000 --> 2:20:53.000]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[2:20:53.000 --> 2:20:59.000]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients and stress, you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients,
[2:20:59.000 --> 2:21:02.000]  amino acids, vitamins and minerals needed daily.
[2:21:02.000 --> 2:21:07.000]  That's why Infawars Life created the powerful vitamin mineral fusion formula,

[2:22:19.000 --> 2:22:24.000]  That's why folks are taking back control of their lives with these little Faraday cages
[2:22:24.000 --> 2:22:28.000]  that you can put your cell phones in that knock out the ability of the cell towers
[2:22:28.000 --> 2:22:31.000]  to ping at every few seconds and track your location.
[2:22:31.000 --> 2:22:35.000]  This is the only way to have your privacy and people are taking their privacy back
[2:22:35.000 --> 2:22:40.000]  and it's very, very exciting. They're at $19.95 apiece at InfawarsStore.com
[2:22:40.000 --> 2:22:44.000]  We've ordered even more. A huge shipment's coming in next week, so get yours now
[2:22:44.000 --> 2:22:48.000]  and be part of the movement to cut Big Brother off.
[2:22:48.000 --> 2:22:59.000]  Human Freedom. The Wild Wild West. The Renaissance. America. Human Liberty.
[2:22:59.000 --> 2:23:07.000]  The West built all the freedom, all the choices, all the empowerment we see.
[2:23:07.000 --> 2:23:13.000]  The general population has been programmed that submission to tyranny brings them prosperity
[2:23:13.000 --> 2:23:18.000]  because the last 50 years under psychotic globalist control, they have taught us
[2:23:18.000 --> 2:23:26.000]  by successive approximation to bow down and each time be given a reward, a treat.
[2:23:26.000 --> 2:23:30.000]  That's like training wild pigs to come eat out of your hand and finally,
[2:23:30.000 --> 2:23:35.000]  one day you lead them into the barn and close the door and butcher them.
[2:23:35.000 --> 2:23:42.000]  We're now reaching that point in societal development where submission is death,
[2:23:42.000 --> 2:24:09.000]  where submission is the human species being destroyed forever on the altar of Satan.
[2:24:09.000 --> 2:24:16.000]  Resistance to Tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones.
[2:24:16.000 --> 2:24:19.000]  You know, I'm going to butcher this to try to make it quick so I get the calls
[2:24:19.000 --> 2:24:22.000]  and get the commentary from Savannah Hernandez and Owen Schreuer,
[2:24:22.000 --> 2:24:28.000]  who hosts the War Room coming up at 3 o'clock central today after John Rabaport comes up in the next hour.
[2:24:28.000 --> 2:24:32.000]  I want to get to some of these callers that have been patiently holding like Joe and Wild
[2:24:32.000 --> 2:24:38.000]  and Nicholas and a few of the others there that have just been calling in Jefferson, Jason, others.
[2:24:38.000 --> 2:24:45.000]  We study how British Navy brought in opium out of India and out of Afghanistan
[2:24:45.000 --> 2:24:48.000]  and got the Chinese ports corrupted.
[2:24:48.000 --> 2:24:52.000]  China made it illegal and then over about 100 years they took over China
[2:24:52.000 --> 2:24:55.000]  and they broke China up into different zones.
[2:24:55.000 --> 2:25:00.000]  The French would occupy one, the Americans another, the Dutch another, the British another.
[2:25:00.000 --> 2:25:05.000]  And the Chinese government admits, oh, we're doing it back to you because you did it to us.
[2:25:05.000 --> 2:25:07.000]  That's why they shipped the fentanyl in or whatever.
[2:25:07.000 --> 2:25:12.000]  But when you see the homeless all laid out, drugged out, and you see hundreds of thousands of deaths from it a year,
[2:25:12.000 --> 2:25:15.000]  I mean, that's what's happening to America, but it's bigger than that.
[2:25:15.000 --> 2:25:17.000]  They have cell phones.
[2:25:17.000 --> 2:25:22.000]  So the homeless can sit there and grill, lay out, do whatever, get all their welfare money
[2:25:22.000 --> 2:25:25.000]  that the Democrats manage for them and take a slice of.
[2:25:25.000 --> 2:25:31.000]  And so people are just opting out and then becoming this political tool, this political weapon.
[2:25:31.000 --> 2:25:40.000]  And it really just shows you the paradox of an open, free, wealthy society creates these spoiled brats that don't want to do anything.
[2:25:40.000 --> 2:25:43.000]  And America does use more drugs than any other country in the world.
[2:25:43.000 --> 2:25:47.000]  And I just wonder, is such a selfish nation or even meant to survive?
[2:25:47.000 --> 2:25:50.000]  You want to comment on that, Savannah?
[2:25:50.000 --> 2:25:54.000]  Alex, like I said, I've just been sitting back and watching all of this,
[2:25:54.000 --> 2:26:00.000]  but the destruction of America that has happened just over the past couple of years watching this has been so sad to see.
[2:26:00.000 --> 2:26:02.000]  And I hope that we can come back from it.
[2:26:02.000 --> 2:26:04.000]  And, you know, like you said, we're so selfish.
[2:26:04.000 --> 2:26:06.000]  We deserve to be in this spot.
[2:26:06.000 --> 2:26:09.000]  And I mean, I really, I don't know, Owen.
[2:26:09.000 --> 2:26:21.000]  Well, the NBA players are the kind of epitome, I think, of this where an NBA athlete makes more money than any other athlete on the planet for average salary.
[2:26:21.000 --> 2:26:26.000]  Now, that's because there's, you know, maybe only 12 guys on the team, but they're making on average about five million a year.
[2:26:26.000 --> 2:26:31.000]  That's for the worst player, the bench guy who doesn't even step on the floor once all season.
[2:26:31.000 --> 2:26:33.000]  He's making millions of dollars.
[2:26:33.000 --> 2:26:38.000]  And then they're all going to take a knee when if they could have filled arenas,
[2:26:38.000 --> 2:26:43.000]  aside from, you know, the Spike Lee's or whoever who can afford the court side seats every night,
[2:26:43.000 --> 2:26:50.000]  the combined wealth of the entire audience probably equal one of these players.
[2:26:50.000 --> 2:26:57.000]  And then they're going to take a knee in the national anthem and pretend to be oppressed until Americans to feel oppressed.
[2:26:57.000 --> 2:27:05.000]  As you have millionaire black athletes and millionaire black entertainers who all make money in this supposed white supremacist society,
[2:27:05.000 --> 2:27:08.000]  they've loaded their bank accounts with tens of millions of dollars.
[2:27:08.000 --> 2:27:10.000]  And then we're just supposed to accept it.
[2:27:10.000 --> 2:27:15.000]  And then when you actually, if you wanted to be like, oh, okay, black lives matter, what is this about?
[2:27:15.000 --> 2:27:21.000]  Sounds kind of good. And then you actually do the research like we're going to get rid of the family and communism is the way it's like,
[2:27:21.000 --> 2:27:27.000]  you know, like Marcellus Wiley did a Fox Sports host of a show.
[2:27:27.000 --> 2:27:29.000]  He said, you know, I looked into black lives matter.
[2:27:29.000 --> 2:27:31.000]  They're against everything I stand for.
[2:27:31.000 --> 2:27:32.000]  They're against the family.
[2:27:32.000 --> 2:27:34.000]  They want to end the nuclear family. I'm a father.
[2:27:34.000 --> 2:27:35.000]  I'm a proud father.
[2:27:35.000 --> 2:27:36.000]  He's got daughters.
[2:27:36.000 --> 2:27:40.000]  He's like, no, I don't want them to grow up thinking the nuclear family is bad.
[2:27:40.000 --> 2:27:42.000]  No, I don't want them to thinking I'm bad because I'm a father.
[2:27:42.000 --> 2:27:46.000]  You know, that's not, I'm paraphrasing, but I never played that clip.
[2:27:46.000 --> 2:27:47.000]  That was really powerful.
[2:27:47.000 --> 2:27:48.000]  What's the name of that clip?
[2:27:48.000 --> 2:27:49.000]  It's Marcellus Wiley.
[2:27:49.000 --> 2:27:52.000]  He's on the Marcell in the NBA TV or whatever.
[2:27:52.000 --> 2:27:53.000]  It's Fox Sports one.
[2:27:53.000 --> 2:27:54.000]  I don't know what the name of the show is.
[2:27:54.000 --> 2:27:55.000]  Say it again.
[2:27:55.000 --> 2:27:56.000]  And they'll pull it up.
[2:27:56.000 --> 2:27:57.000]  Talks about black lives matter.
[2:27:57.000 --> 2:27:58.000]  What was it?
[2:27:58.000 --> 2:27:59.000]  Yeah, it's Marcellus Wiley.
[2:27:59.000 --> 2:28:00.000]  I would say black lives matter.
[2:28:00.000 --> 2:28:01.000]  Yeah, there there.
[2:28:01.000 --> 2:28:02.000]  There's that for next time.
[2:28:02.000 --> 2:28:03.000]  We're only a few minutes.
[2:28:03.000 --> 2:28:05.000]  I want to go to a few calls here, but you're absolutely right.
[2:28:05.000 --> 2:28:08.000]  Well, but here's the thing, Alex, you got to understand he's on Fox Sports one,
[2:28:08.000 --> 2:28:12.000]  which is kind of like an up and coming sports station, it's been around for maybe 10 years
[2:28:12.000 --> 2:28:13.000]  now.
[2:28:13.000 --> 2:28:15.000]  You wouldn't be allowed to say that on Sports Center.
[2:28:15.000 --> 2:28:17.000]  Oh, the ESPN, I read the transcripts.
[2:28:17.000 --> 2:28:19.000]  It is like America sucks.
[2:28:19.000 --> 2:28:20.000]  China's good.
[2:28:20.000 --> 2:28:24.000]  In fact, just the other day, I covered this on the war room yesterday.
[2:28:24.000 --> 2:28:29.000]  You guys may be able to find the tweet, but Sports Center, which is ESPN's, you know,
[2:28:29.000 --> 2:28:34.000]  top tier show, Sports Center put out a tweet and they, and they always do this now.
[2:28:34.000 --> 2:28:39.000]  They can look at it and they have black lives matter capitalized every time, black lives matter
[2:28:39.000 --> 2:28:42.000]  capitalized, and they never capitalized the national anthem.
[2:28:42.000 --> 2:28:46.000]  So, so they're literally putting these photos, right?
[2:28:46.000 --> 2:28:50.000]  Now, we'll never capitalize white because it's bad.
[2:28:50.000 --> 2:28:52.000]  Always capitalizes black as if that helps black people.
[2:28:52.000 --> 2:28:57.000]  This is evil mega corporations that own slave camps in China just saying, don't attack us.
[2:28:57.000 --> 2:28:58.000]  We represent black people.
[2:28:58.000 --> 2:29:01.000]  It's the most insane expropriation.
[2:29:01.000 --> 2:29:05.880]  Like, you know, I saw a story where this guy's white daughter died and they gave her heart to a black guy
[2:29:05.880 --> 2:29:09.680]  I'm like, oh, that's cultural appropriation. No, that's just humans, you know taking care of each other
[2:29:09.680 --> 2:29:11.680]  But imagine that Savannah
[2:29:12.200 --> 2:29:19.760]  Definitely Alex and you know, we talked about to the NBA players and China infiltrating just all of these organizations and
[2:29:20.560 --> 2:29:23.920]  Alex, I mean, that's exactly it. And I'm sorry, you know, this morning was so long
[2:29:23.920 --> 2:29:29.000]  So I I'm kind of blank today, but you are not blank. I'm a little bit
[2:29:29.000 --> 2:29:33.800]  I'm a little bit blank today, Alex, but you know, you were out there yesterday covering Steven Crowder and
[2:29:34.360 --> 2:29:39.240]  Yesterday and then today just covering all of this BLM nonsense here in the city of Austin and
[2:29:39.480 --> 2:29:45.920]  It's just been so disheartening to watch and see and I really hope and pray for our country every single day because people have
[2:29:45.920 --> 2:29:50.600]  Just strayed so far from the traditional family from religion from God
[2:29:50.600 --> 2:29:54.200]  We've allowed China to overtake our country and like you said, too, you know
[2:29:54.200 --> 2:29:59.960]  People are distracted right now by Uncle Ben and Aunt Gemma Maya because it's cultural appropriation. It's bad
[2:29:59.960 --> 2:30:02.640]  You know, they use a black person, but they're completely
[2:30:03.400 --> 2:30:07.440]  Distracted from the fact that like you said, there's still concentration camps in China
[2:30:07.600 --> 2:30:11.920]  China is overtaking Hong Kong people who are actually fighting for democracy over there
[2:30:11.920 --> 2:30:17.800]  And you went to Hong Kong America. Yes, you you sent me over there and I when I talked to those people they love Donald Trump
[2:30:17.800 --> 2:30:23.720]  They love America because they truly understand what it means to be oppressed to have their freedoms taken away to have their freedom of speech
[2:30:23.720 --> 2:30:25.720]  taken away to
[2:30:25.800 --> 2:30:32.840]  Experience police brutality the people here in America have it easy compared to the people in Hong Kong because they're fighting against China
[2:30:32.960 --> 2:30:37.360]  This oppressive regime which is trying to enslave people that disappears people in the street
[2:30:37.360 --> 2:30:42.680]  The people in Portland are acting like that's what's taught and what's happening to them. Okay. It's not they have no idea
[2:30:42.800 --> 2:30:50.520]  What it really means to be oppressed by authoritarianism like the people in Hong Kong do but see but that's why this is such a just offensive joke
[2:30:50.520 --> 2:30:53.760]  Because they act like they're social justice warriors
[2:30:53.760 --> 2:31:00.640]  They act like they're fighting the good fight and then but if you try to actually engage in linear logic and just follow down a thought pattern
[2:31:00.720 --> 2:31:02.720]  It's I okay. Well again
[2:31:02.720 --> 2:31:09.720]  China which controls the NBA controls most of your television controls most of the internet you see controls Hollywood
[2:31:09.720 --> 2:31:16.720]  I mean, China's controlling all this stuff. They're the ones with the slave labor camps. They're the one with the child labor force
[2:31:16.720 --> 2:31:23.160]  They're the one with the dissident camps. That's not in America. Oh, well, so it's just like China's literally behind all of it
[2:31:23.160 --> 2:31:28.840]  It's like Alex. I was telling you this during the break. I'm sitting in front of the Google headquarters in the Info Wars armored truck
[2:31:29.200 --> 2:31:31.840]  On the PA and there's Caddy corner to me
[2:31:31.840 --> 2:31:36.200]  There's a big construction crew going on and I'm just I'm just sitting there on the PA talking about China
[2:31:36.240 --> 2:31:42.600]  How they have the slave labor how they have the child labor and I'm just blasting Google for letting China run Google
[2:31:42.600 --> 2:31:49.960]  And I have liberals driving by and they flick me off and say F you and it's like you're the ones that are the social justice warriors
[2:31:49.960 --> 2:31:55.360]  You're the bleeding hard liberals. Where are you on China? It's just it just because they don't care
[2:31:55.360 --> 2:31:57.360]  They think they're part of the establishment
[2:31:57.360 --> 2:32:02.560]  And they just follow that we're the good guys. You're the bad guy and it's just some weird power trip where it's like
[2:32:02.560 --> 2:32:09.080]  Oh, I feel good. I just flicked off a conservative. I just flicked off a Trump supporter. I'm fighting the good fight
[2:32:09.080 --> 2:32:14.120]  It's like no, you're a clown in a face mask breathing in your own toxic
[2:32:14.120 --> 2:32:21.880]  No, I didn't ask you a question says what do you think of the NBA corruption? You did a great great breakdown of what's happening
[2:32:22.800 --> 2:32:25.120]  It's hurting the NBA. It's hurting the NFL
[2:32:25.120 --> 2:32:30.200]  It's hurting all these groups that do this, but still they do it because they're bought and paid for there's an agenda
[2:32:30.200 --> 2:32:31.520]  In this country, right?
[2:32:31.520 --> 2:32:37.400]  And I mean like you said to all of their ratings completely crashed after they came out in protest and then again, too
[2:32:37.400 --> 2:32:42.680]  Who was the one NBA player who has made headlines who has made big ways? It was the one in me a player
[2:32:42.680 --> 2:32:46.120]  I don't know his name, but he then he hurt his knee and they celebrated that Jonathan Isaac
[2:32:46.160 --> 2:32:52.360]  The national anthem Jonathan Isaac and his jerseys went to like top sales. Yeah, and why then you heard is me and then you deserve it
[2:32:53.280 --> 2:32:55.400]  No, yeah, and why did he make top sales?
[2:32:55.400 --> 2:33:02.520]  Why was he making headlines and ways because he stood up for America and I think it was I can't remember but back in the
[2:33:03.320 --> 2:33:05.320]  a while back it was during the Olympics
[2:33:05.320 --> 2:33:11.560]  He was a wrestler. He held up the American flag and he waved it and then everyone was demonizing him for it
[2:33:11.560 --> 2:33:14.920]  And he was like I didn't know that standing up for America and waving an American flag
[2:33:15.120 --> 2:33:18.680]  Would be a political statement and we've gone to that point now
[2:33:18.680 --> 2:33:20.760]  I mean we big because they're getting rid of the country folks
[2:33:20.760 --> 2:33:27.240]  It's here and that means everything and that means replacing it with global government contact tracers world ID
[2:33:27.280 --> 2:33:31.280]  This is the rollout of the world ID. They plan to collapse America. They plan to bring it up

[2:34:46.660 --> 2:34:50.380]  Been on air in 26 years starting about 24 years ago
[2:34:50.380 --> 2:34:55.300]  I began to get calls from major Hollywood directors producers actors
[2:34:55.300 --> 2:34:58.900]  They wanted to meet with me and they said what is your formal education?
[2:34:58.900 --> 2:35:03.780]  And I said well really nothing but a few years of college. They said well, how are you one of the best?
[2:35:04.540 --> 2:35:10.180]  Science fiction or cultural writers. We've ever heard the stuff you come up with is just
[2:35:10.900 --> 2:35:15.580]  Unbelievable we'd like to be in movies. We'd like you to write with us. We'd like you to do voiceovers
[2:35:15.580 --> 2:35:20.860]  You're just a renaissance man that folks know I was in some movies and Harry Shearer makes statements like that a lot of others
[2:35:20.860 --> 2:35:26.640]  I'm not bragging I kept explaining to them. I said do you understand I didn't come up with any of this
[2:35:26.780 --> 2:35:31.620]  I'm reading globalist MIT white papers and futurist documents
[2:35:31.820 --> 2:35:36.020]  And they would just laugh me and say oh no way then I would give them the documents
[2:35:36.020 --> 2:35:40.780]  They would get very very scared the next time I saw them in a few months and say man, you're right
[2:35:40.780 --> 2:35:45.740]  This is just hoping folks. I didn't make any of this up. Okay. It's real. It's real
[2:35:47.100 --> 2:35:52.300]  The BBC is state-run media in the UK and they've come out with a detailed article
[2:35:52.620 --> 2:35:55.500]  It's linked on info wars comm saying
[2:35:56.260 --> 2:36:00.180]  You will have to have forced inoculations multiple times a year
[2:36:00.580 --> 2:36:03.820]  To be able to travel robots will scan you when you land

[2:36:11.540 --> 2:36:15.220]  The Microsoft website now officially has announced the digital tattoo
[2:36:15.620 --> 2:36:21.980]  We exposed this six months ago how Bill Gates was funding it and they had hundreds of news articles attacking and saying it wasn't true
[2:36:22.180 --> 2:36:27.820]  This is a tactic to use first they announce it. We say it's a bad idea. They say that's crazy. We didn't do it
[2:36:27.900 --> 2:36:33.980]  They introduced the idea to you then they come back and announce it again thinking you have no memory. This is a criminal
[2:36:33.980 --> 2:36:38.540]  Takeover. This is the line in the sand. We must say no
[2:36:38.540 --> 2:36:46.540]  We must expose the fraud of COVID-19. This entire house of evil is built on. I'm Alex Jones never surrendered a tyranny in full words dot com

[2:38:17.740 --> 2:38:21.620]  But right now you have been holding as true troopers as great Americans
[2:38:21.620 --> 2:38:28.540]  I want to thank Nicholas Wilde and Joe for holding so let's go ahead and go to Nicholas in New Jersey here on the air
[2:38:28.540 --> 2:38:30.540]  Thank you
[2:38:30.780 --> 2:38:35.900]  Hey Alex, I had an info wars product question before my actual question. Yes, sir. Go ahead
[2:38:35.900 --> 2:38:40.700]  I was just wondering if you guys have like an adrenal support supplement
[2:38:40.700 --> 2:38:45.700]  You know cuz America has adrenal fatigue really bad like overall, so I was just believe me. I've got it
[2:38:45.700 --> 2:38:48.340]  I finally hit the wall man, even the supplement self of me
[2:38:48.340 --> 2:38:52.860]  I got a room to take them all a DNA force cleans out your cells. It supports adrenal support
[2:38:53.660 --> 2:38:59.660]  X2 does it. I mean basically selenium does it you got to know that I'm the one that forgets to take my vitamins
[2:38:59.660 --> 2:39:01.420]  Then I get tired like I'm today
[2:39:01.420 --> 2:39:03.420]  but I would take I
[2:39:04.100 --> 2:39:07.900]  Would take the X2 of the X3 I would take vitamin
[2:39:07.900 --> 2:39:15.740]  B12 ultra 12. I mean those are all the things of the baseline so that no matter how much caffeine you get
[2:39:15.740 --> 2:39:17.980]  It doesn't work anymore if you don't have the bottom in D3
[2:39:17.980 --> 2:39:23.020]  You don't have the bottom and B12 you don't have I mean obviously you can take turbo force
[2:39:23.700 --> 2:39:28.140]  But that's not supporting the adrenals itself. It's ordering them to pump more stuff out
[2:39:28.620 --> 2:39:33.820]  But it works really great. So that's a really really good question. I would say that
[2:39:33.820 --> 2:39:37.620]  I've said it's the one I mentioned. What do you think Owen?
[2:39:38.380 --> 2:39:40.580]  Yeah, that's interesting point you make about the turbo force
[2:39:40.580 --> 2:39:45.500]  I was wondering why I get like 10 to 13 hours of energy when I drink the turbo force
[2:39:45.500 --> 2:39:48.980]  I guess it makes sense because I'm loaded up on the vitamin B's and C's and everything else
[2:39:48.980 --> 2:39:53.620]  No, no, it's in there too. That's why it helps some but it's still ordering your body to produce the stuff
[2:39:53.900 --> 2:40:00.940]  Yeah, I think that definitely the nascent iodine just to kind of kick everything into gear at just just on the
[2:40:00.940 --> 2:40:05.780]  outset, there's so many great things in the DNA Force Plus, but yeah, Owen was bald till he took it
[2:40:07.060 --> 2:40:09.060]  I'm joking folks
[2:40:09.700 --> 2:40:15.060]  If you want the hair bio PCA the bio 10 and the bio PCA is good for your hair
[2:40:15.580 --> 2:40:19.660]  But you know for adrenal sport, honestly, if you're a if you're a man or even a woman
[2:40:19.660 --> 2:40:23.860]  I mean super male vitality has so many things that that are just gonna at the very least
[2:40:24.100 --> 2:40:26.740]  Give you that same kind of drive and energy every day
[2:40:26.740 --> 2:40:32.340]  If I had to recommend one thing I'd say DNA Force Plus because it's got the PQQ the CoQ 10 and a bunch of other things
[2:40:32.340 --> 2:40:35.900]  They go in and clean out the cells and I'm saying all this and remembering that a
[2:40:36.700 --> 2:40:38.700]  week ago I cleaned off the
[2:40:38.860 --> 2:40:41.660]  Desk here it's dirty again of my all my little things here
[2:40:42.260 --> 2:40:45.700]  And I need to put them back on her because I forget to take them myself
[2:40:46.340 --> 2:40:48.700]  But does answer question Nicholas?
[2:40:49.260 --> 2:40:53.180]  No, no, but I wanted to ask a real question of you know after that
[2:40:53.180 --> 2:40:56.300]  I was just saying you know just for the adrenal thing because I would you know I would like to support
[2:40:56.300 --> 2:41:01.820]  So I mean the adrenal support thing because you know some some products out there are called adrenal support other companies have
[2:41:01.980 --> 2:41:05.140]  All the stuff we put out one way or another supports your adrenals
[2:41:05.140 --> 2:41:09.580]  I mean, I would say that I would say the ultra 12. I would say that the iodine it have you taken those
[2:41:10.660 --> 2:41:14.020]  No, I haven't I just got the privacy pouch. I was just asking about the supplements
[2:41:14.020 --> 2:41:16.660]  I just figured cuz you know adrenaline is like pretty much like Jesus Jews
[2:41:16.660 --> 2:41:19.820]  You could you know, so you might threaten your family you could lift up a car or something
[2:41:19.820 --> 2:41:23.980]  That's really powerful energy and I just figure adrenal support would be critical in these times
[2:41:23.980 --> 2:41:27.620]  No, you're absolutely right and and what's what I said real sport. I don't just think of the
[2:41:29.300 --> 2:41:33.820]  I think a glandular support and again, I'm not one of the experts here. I have experts at the Zonar products
[2:41:34.020 --> 2:41:38.540]  If I had to take one thing it'd be x2 x3 or it'd be that it'd be the DNA force
[2:41:38.860 --> 2:41:42.940]  So Nicholas, what's your point on COVID coming the Carrington event?
[2:41:43.660 --> 2:41:47.380]  Yeah, that's what I wanted to know like if you if you maybe had any insight on that
[2:41:47.380 --> 2:41:49.020]  I wondered if they were
[2:41:49.020 --> 2:41:54.620]  Gonna get behind maybe a natural rhythm or like a natural event like a Carrington event, you know
[2:41:54.620 --> 2:41:58.620]  Like the coronal mass ejection. I figured that might be the that's why the moniker is what it is
[2:41:58.620 --> 2:42:03.140]  You know the coronal mass ejection is the Carrington event and when it happened in 1859
[2:42:03.140 --> 2:42:08.740]  It it knocked out all the communications and electricity and I wonder maybe that's the 5g connection that they want to
[2:42:09.100 --> 2:42:12.100]  get behind the momentum of an a natural event and then
[2:42:12.660 --> 2:42:16.300]  Everybody thinks it's a bio attack or something and then they rush to get the vaccines
[2:42:16.300 --> 2:42:19.940]  And then they won't even be able to leave like the 5g grid. It'll be like a shock collar
[2:42:20.180 --> 2:42:23.900]  And what you're saying is from your own research your own gut level
[2:42:25.220 --> 2:42:30.820]  That the the poles are shifting that's happening that's proven and a lot of crazy stuff's going on
[2:42:30.820 --> 2:42:34.740]  We know the earth gets hit by asteroids and comets a lot more often than they had said previously
[2:42:34.740 --> 2:42:41.100]  And you're absolutely right the establishment is acting like they are scared to death and are stirring around trying to lock us down
[2:42:41.100 --> 2:42:47.060]  Ahead of something big and I totally agree with you. What do you think? Oh, and what do you think Savannah?
[2:42:48.020 --> 2:42:54.140]  Well, if you look through human history, there's always cycles. I know that we've covered these cycles here whether it's just
[2:42:54.820 --> 2:42:57.460]  Recent recorded history or even ancient recorded history
[2:42:58.180 --> 2:43:00.740]  So there's always cycles and I mean we won't go too
[2:43:01.420 --> 2:43:02.860]  Esoteric or deep into this stuff
[2:43:02.860 --> 2:43:07.060]  But I mean we know very little at least we're told very little about ancient civilization
[2:43:07.060 --> 2:43:13.860]  We know wars always start during sunspots and then we know depression start during I guess Wall Street follows that my yeah
[2:43:13.860 --> 2:43:16.460]  My response to Nicholas would be that absolutely
[2:43:16.980 --> 2:43:23.340]  There is a class of elite that has access to history that they don't allow the general public to have and they are probably
[2:43:23.500 --> 2:43:26.140]  Trying to plan events around that whether it's a
[2:43:26.660 --> 2:43:30.860]  Why are all the billionaires building armored bunkers with with runways the middle of nowhere?
[2:43:31.060 --> 2:43:35.820]  It's not because of COVID folks and they'll make the reasoning is oh, you can't tell humans all this
[2:43:35.820 --> 2:43:40.220]  They'll go into a panic. It's really just so they can get prepared before the rest of us
[2:43:40.980 --> 2:43:42.500]  And they want to tell us lockdown
[2:43:42.500 --> 2:43:48.140]  I said I guess when some bio-weapon gets released or like you said some supercarriage in event hits and a bunch people
[2:43:48.540 --> 2:43:51.260]  Physically get ill from it. What do you think? Alex?
[2:43:51.260 --> 2:43:52.860]  I'm not well versed on this type of stuff
[2:43:52.860 --> 2:43:58.820]  But I would say to anyone who's like me continue listening to Alex Jones because he's constantly talking about this type of stuff and
[2:43:59.180 --> 2:44:04.420]  Also selling storable foods to help with this type of stuff, you know preparedness. That's a very important thing
[2:44:04.420 --> 2:44:07.780]  So that's one reason I'm mad at myself is it a selfish level?
[2:44:07.780 --> 2:44:11.460]  I want to just move to the middle of nowhere with my kids and just not do this anymore
[2:44:11.460 --> 2:44:13.980]  It's not because I'm afraid of the globalist. I feel guilty
[2:44:14.740 --> 2:44:19.100]  That I that I'm staying in a major city. I just feel like that. How do you feel?
[2:44:20.060 --> 2:44:24.340]  Same Alex, you know after living here in Austin, Texas, especially and watching the
[2:44:25.500 --> 2:44:32.260]  deterioration of our city with the homelessness with all of the people coming here destroying small businesses destroying
[2:44:32.260 --> 2:44:37.860]  People's livelihoods. That's right. You only got out of school a few years ago. We were in San Antonio, right?
[2:44:37.860 --> 2:44:42.900]  Mm-hmm, and and so that's deteriorated too, but Austin. I mean it Austin's falling apart, right?
[2:44:42.900 --> 2:44:46.460]  I mean you want like two three years. This is the first time I've lived somewhere, you know
[2:44:46.460 --> 2:44:50.540]  I'm paying bills. I'm living on my own and for the first time I'm living by myself
[2:44:50.620 --> 2:44:54.780]  And I had to move out of my old apartment because the homelessness was getting so bad
[2:44:54.780 --> 2:44:58.300]  I had to go and buy a gun because I don't feel safe living in my own city
[2:44:58.300 --> 2:45:04.340]  Anymore because there's people knocking on my door. There's homeless people going through my trash can at night
[2:45:04.340 --> 2:45:12.180]  It's terrifying so to see the deterioration of these big cities and how this is spread across America and no one's really doing anything about
[2:45:12.180 --> 2:45:13.700]  What's causing it?
[2:45:13.700 --> 2:45:16.300]  I mean, it's the catering to the homeless. Yeah
[2:45:16.980 --> 2:45:20.500]  Exactly in our mayor allowing people to camp in the streets
[2:45:21.060 --> 2:45:25.740]  We're enabling this every single day and you know, it's only gonna keep getting worse
[2:45:25.740 --> 2:45:30.020]  We're gonna turn into like, you know, Joe Rogan's move to the Texas. I'm not gonna say where but where do you think he's gonna move?
[2:45:30.340 --> 2:45:36.660]  That's kind of like an impar stressed back. He goes. I'm looking for Yoda goes. Oh Yoda not far. I'll take you to him, but
[2:45:37.660 --> 2:45:40.980]  Alice I heard you had an incident with some bum piss today
[2:45:41.900 --> 2:45:42.940]  well
[2:45:42.940 --> 2:45:45.820]  Yeah, Stephen Crowder is hanging over this this bridge
[2:45:46.140 --> 2:45:51.980]  There's all these homeless down there and there's like needles and feces everywhere. He goes that smells like bum piss
[2:45:51.980 --> 2:45:56.860]  I go and I know the smell and it makes me sick of it. It's actually the smell is of
[2:45:58.900 --> 2:46:05.020]  Dust mites and they're and they're extra man. It's like musty or something. Yeah, and I started almost throwing up just
[2:46:05.900 --> 2:46:07.400]  Wrenching in the street
[2:46:07.400 --> 2:46:11.580]  Yeah, I was on camera, right? It was a sight. It wasn't fake. I mean, he's like, I know
[2:46:11.580 --> 2:46:14.660]  I mean, you took a big whiff of bum piss and it wasn't good for you
[2:46:14.940 --> 2:46:17.300]  But it's not just the bump. I mean, let me tell you something
[2:46:17.300 --> 2:46:24.340]  I went to Skid Row in LA a few years ago. It was horrific. It was horrible. It was I saw stuff. I've never imagined you see concentration camp footage
[2:46:24.340 --> 2:46:31.180]  It's terrible, but those people aren't like demonically possessed. I mean, these are like people going with like you can see their
[2:46:31.700 --> 2:46:36.980]  Spine they're so skinny on heroin and then it's a tranny. It's so it's like a skeleton tranny going
[2:46:37.940 --> 2:46:40.780]  At you with flies all over their genitals hanging out
[2:46:41.980 --> 2:46:45.620]  But but now we're going by doorways and there's like people like vampire movies like
[2:46:45.620 --> 2:46:52.820]  Wiggling and dirt with sores all over their body and piles of needles and it's just like what the hell is this?
[2:46:52.820 --> 2:46:53.740]  No, it's out of control
[2:46:53.740 --> 2:46:59.060]  Actually, I shot a special about three years ago where I went into the woods and just found so many heaps of trash
[2:46:59.060 --> 2:47:04.060]  And you know, there's actually homeless people here that actually do care about the city and love the city and they hate to see what's happening
[2:47:04.060 --> 2:47:08.860]  A lot of them are better in bottom of the hill, but it's the new class of the which have been butched in but you know, Alex
[2:47:08.860 --> 2:47:10.340]  I'll tell you this
[2:47:10.340 --> 2:47:15.780]  And maybe the crew can find this in the in the final minute here when I moved here five years ago
[2:47:15.940 --> 2:47:21.860]  It was it was the top city Austin was considered the top city to move to one of the top cities to live in no matter
[2:47:21.860 --> 2:47:28.540]  What travel guide or web, you know travel site you had it was like Austin was always top one or two or top five guaranteed
[2:47:28.540 --> 2:47:34.220]  And that's when I moved here. I've been here five years. There is no way Austin is top in these lists again
[2:47:34.220 --> 2:47:41.780]  There there is no way that I would would tell people to to move there's literally homeless under every overpass
[2:47:41.780 --> 2:47:46.780]  This is footage that I shot about two or three years ago when it really started to get out of control here
[2:47:46.780 --> 2:47:51.140]  And it's sad because I've witnessed it with my own two eyes living here five years Austin
[2:47:51.580 --> 2:47:54.780]  Which was really on the rise in the industry still booming and you know
[2:47:54.780 --> 2:47:58.780]  The the nice leftist liberal companies are all coming here to destroy our infrastructure
[2:47:58.780 --> 2:48:03.860]  But now I mean Austin is going the way of LA and unless there's a drastic pivot the other direction
[2:48:03.860 --> 2:48:06.140]  It's uh, it's not going to be pleasant sadly
[2:48:06.140 --> 2:48:13.500]  And that was the red pill for me to just actually watching our Democrat mayor take a beautiful city and completely ruin it and incentivize it
[2:48:13.860 --> 2:48:18.100]  Exactly I fly around with shane stunner this helicopter. There's the garbage like this everywhere
[2:48:18.100 --> 2:48:23.340]  Yeah, but guys to fly over what I talked to the homeless what they do is they just go grit dumpsters of trash
[2:48:23.340 --> 2:48:26.860]  And they take it back there and they sift through it for what they want and then they just leave it there
[2:48:28.060 --> 2:48:29.500]  so
[2:48:29.500 --> 2:48:34.900]  But mayor Adler doesn't have you try to cut a two inch tree in your backyard there or like you have a chicken in the wrong area
[2:48:34.900 --> 2:48:36.900]  You know, yeah
[2:48:37.140 --> 2:48:42.440]  Americans have had freedom for so long and most Americans were born into such
[2:48:42.820 --> 2:48:47.220]  Dossall times compared to the rest of history that we really have a blind spot for tyranny
[2:48:47.540 --> 2:48:50.020]  We don't appreciate the American way truth
[2:48:50.500 --> 2:48:52.500]  Justice due process the right to self-defense
[2:48:52.980 --> 2:48:57.120]  Private property because we've had it so long and we just think that's how the rest of the world is
[2:48:57.120 --> 2:49:00.040]  Ladies and gentlemen the Renaissance the social contract
[2:49:00.080 --> 2:49:06.840]  That's 500 years old to try to build up humanity and try to believe in humanity and to try to empower the weak as well
[2:49:06.840 --> 2:49:11.120]  It's a strong is something the West invented and that's what made our modern world
[2:49:11.320 --> 2:49:18.320]  That's now been hijacked by the technocrats by the globalist who say humans are ugly and bad for the earth that we need to be cold and
[2:49:18.600 --> 2:49:25.760]  Dumped down and put into subgroups that the elites dominate manipulate and command if we're even lucky enough to stay alive
[2:49:25.760 --> 2:49:29.220]  And that's what COVID-19 is a global UN
[2:49:30.120 --> 2:49:36.780]  Revolution against free humanity against your family against prosperity and against your future if you don't stand up and fight you deserve what you get a
[2:49:38.200 --> 2:49:45.040]  Lot of you are probably already very familiar with these terms about introduced, but some folks aren't so those that aren't here
[2:49:45.040 --> 2:49:47.040]  They are activated charcoal
[2:49:48.280 --> 2:49:51.220]  And then another term enamel safe
[2:49:51.220 --> 2:49:57.420]  Activated charcoal is the fastest growing type of toothpaste for a good reason
[2:49:57.660 --> 2:50:04.420]  It really really works what we've come up with the best activated charcoal toothpaste with no fillers the cleanest time the highest quality
[2:50:04.420 --> 2:50:11.300]  With a bunch of high quality and central oils and other ingredients known and documented to do amazing things for your oral hygiene

[2:50:18.540 --> 2:50:26.060]  But on top of that it doesn't have any ingredients that are known to hurt an am I've got up before got toothpaste that really made my teeth clean
[2:50:26.060 --> 2:50:33.260]  But eroded an amel of the top so I got into really safe healthy types of toothpaste and that's what this is
[2:50:33.260 --> 2:50:36.140]  It's available at info or store.com
[2:50:39.180 --> 2:50:42.380]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:50:42.380 --> 2:50:44.860]  Alex Jones show
[2:50:52.940 --> 2:50:54.940]  Michael Obama not run for president
[2:50:56.060 --> 2:51:03.060]  My serious I talked to that caller the whole segment's gone. It's okay to call her great points, but wild in Wisconsin
[2:51:03.060 --> 2:51:04.900]  You're on the air with
[2:51:04.900 --> 2:51:06.820]  Savannah
[2:51:06.820 --> 2:51:08.340]  Hernandez
[2:51:08.340 --> 2:51:10.340]  And Owen stroyer go ahead
[2:51:10.340 --> 2:51:17.180]  Hi Alice Savannah and a big O. I have a spicy toward a milanesa for y'all
[2:51:17.980 --> 2:51:23.060]  As broadcasted orators you've all undeniably mastered the human tongue
[2:51:23.340 --> 2:51:26.220]  So I was wondering landing if you heard of the
[2:51:26.860 --> 2:51:35.020]  Senagora or an Indian dot not feather have a yoga technique of the curry mudra. That's k h e
[2:51:35.700 --> 2:51:36.740]  see a
[2:51:36.740 --> 2:51:38.260]  ri
[2:51:38.260 --> 2:51:44.100]  Face and you D are the master is always the students. So no, I've not heard of this. Tell me about this Taoism
[2:51:45.740 --> 2:51:51.060]  It's a yoga technique and with adrena chrome DMT stuff astral stuff and CIA
[2:51:51.740 --> 2:51:53.740]  Classification of the same being so hot right now
[2:51:54.060 --> 2:52:00.900]  The Senagora tongue technique is according to Wikipedia quote the practice carried out of curling the tip of the tongue of the
[2:52:01.180 --> 2:52:06.260]  Back into the mouth until it reaches above the soft palate and into the nasal cavity
[2:52:06.260 --> 2:52:08.260]  Yeah, that's also a practice of
[2:52:08.700 --> 2:52:13.780]  Qui gong or chi gong, which is Taoism or Taoism. I actually practice that for a year
[2:52:13.780 --> 2:52:15.780]  You stick your tongue up in your sinuses
[2:52:15.780 --> 2:52:18.540]  So there's a bunch of things you do but one of the things it
[2:52:18.660 --> 2:52:25.620]  It's to it's to basically have the the Tao or the the one or God flow through you and there's a bunch of different yoga techniques
[2:52:27.140 --> 2:52:31.300]  Yes, basically basically, but yes the tongue to the top of the mouth is
[2:52:31.300 --> 2:52:38.180]  Is is is well versed in history to be a way to be connected to God or the Creator
[2:52:39.100 --> 2:52:41.100]  Enlighten yourself if you will
[2:52:41.860 --> 2:52:46.980]  It's fair to say Hillary Clinton not doing that. No, she does the cheat code, which is well
[2:52:47.380 --> 2:52:49.540]  We know about that. We'll just keep it at that
[2:52:49.660 --> 2:52:53.460]  But while that's what you're talking about right is putting the tongue on the top and Anna
[2:52:53.460 --> 2:52:58.420]  What do we do with our time centering your avat gravity? That was about us. I don't know Alex
[2:52:58.420 --> 2:53:03.380]  No comment on that one. I I have not um looked into this type of
[2:53:04.420 --> 2:53:06.420]  practice
[2:53:07.220 --> 2:53:11.540]  She's got a little terrifying little syphilis or a little lesion there
[2:53:14.100 --> 2:53:20.740]  Yeah, her girlfriends don't want her to uh, thank you wild go down on earning that was a wild call joe in arkansas
[2:53:21.140 --> 2:53:23.140]  come on down
[2:53:23.140 --> 2:53:29.540]  Okay, thank you Alex. Yeah, you asked for people to call with their solutions and I think this is the good
[2:53:30.180 --> 2:53:34.740]  common sense legal constitutional american solution to the present crisis
[2:53:35.380 --> 2:53:37.380]  Okay, I think the democrat party clearly
[2:53:38.180 --> 2:53:43.540]  Has now become a criminal organization in insurrection against the country. It's not all not all legitimate
[2:53:43.700 --> 2:53:48.580]  I agree. I mean they're like a psychotic group of lunatics. They're even worse than criminals like lunatics
[2:53:48.580 --> 2:53:55.060]  So the constitution says that one of the functions of the militia is to suppress
[2:53:55.940 --> 2:54:01.060]  Insurrection and it says that the president is commander-in-chief of the militia
[2:54:01.380 --> 2:54:07.220]  And I understand the state laws generally define the militia as basically all the patriotic citizens
[2:54:07.620 --> 2:54:11.140]  Particularly the able-bodied men between 18 and 45
[2:54:11.140 --> 2:54:19.300]  So I think president trump ought to get thousands of letters asking him to appoint alex jones as national
[2:54:19.940 --> 2:54:21.940]  militia captain. Oh, yeah
[2:54:21.940 --> 2:54:28.100]  Authorized him to work with the military. I'm 46 though. I'm retired. I'm 11 militia now to put down this inconvenient
[2:54:29.940 --> 2:54:31.380]  Uh, no, but I hear what you're saying brother
[2:54:31.380 --> 2:54:34.020]  I mean the truth is they think the nation states outdated
[2:54:34.420 --> 2:54:37.140]  They're replacing it with a nightmare globalist system
[2:54:37.140 --> 2:54:42.340]  Where the elites fly around in private jets and have huge private states and then where they fund everybody to take
[2:54:42.420 --> 2:54:45.140]  Fitton until they die. Yeah, but let's be clear here alex
[2:54:45.140 --> 2:54:50.420]  I mean human freedom is destined to go worldwide eventually. I mean there's going to be struggles implied
[2:54:50.420 --> 2:54:56.660]  That's this is a war against them. But but but it's a war that when the global system of human freedom goes into place
[2:54:57.220 --> 2:55:00.660]  They've already set up the global system of enslavement. So that's all they're trying to do
[2:55:00.740 --> 2:55:05.540]  They're getting ahead of the global freedom with their global enslavement. No, I totally agree. I totally agree
[2:55:05.540 --> 2:55:07.540]  And that's what the democrats are in on
[2:55:07.940 --> 2:55:10.900]  Well, you can teach us techniques with your tongue to defeat
[2:55:11.940 --> 2:55:17.780]  I can I I haven't practiced Qigong for uh, some time show us how to be one with god real quick
[2:55:19.300 --> 2:55:24.100]  It's it takes it takes months. It took me months to master this people laugh at it. It's pretty goofy
[2:55:24.100 --> 2:55:28.020]  I'm not gonna lie, but uh, you will you will open your chakras and
[2:55:28.580 --> 2:55:30.580]  Starface where he goes like
[2:55:30.580 --> 2:55:37.860]  To the girl, there's like a bug going out and just like grabs it. Oh, not quite not exactly
[2:55:38.340 --> 2:55:43.460]  No, you're uh, your sensei would be correcting your tongue movements if that was going
[2:55:46.500 --> 2:55:50.900]  America and the world should have never been closed. It was all based on
[2:55:51.460 --> 2:55:52.740]  WHO
[2:55:52.740 --> 2:55:55.540]  Billa Melinda Gates Fauci NIH lies

[2:57:06.340 --> 2:57:11.780]  You said the Khmer Rouge did it or they were against it. No, they were practicing
[2:57:12.660 --> 2:57:16.260]  Taoism that made them kill 30% of the republic. Well, we better not do it then
[2:57:17.460 --> 2:57:20.020]  No, that's what they wanted them to stop doing
[2:57:20.980 --> 2:57:21.940]  Oh

[2:57:46.100 --> 2:57:50.740]  You took a big fat whiff a bum piss. That is how he started his day. Okay?
[2:57:50.740 --> 2:57:56.500]  That's how you started your day and your chi was all off. You didn't do the Wim Hof method. You didn't smell the flowers
[2:57:56.500 --> 2:58:04.020]  You took a big fat fentanyl laced whiff of of urine down in the slums here in austin now
[2:58:04.660 --> 2:58:09.300]  And your chi is all off. Alex. I'm not exaggerating. I think we have footage of it
[2:58:09.860 --> 2:58:13.620]  We do dust might infested alex jones this morning
[2:58:14.100 --> 2:58:19.620]  No, but I mean the woman's like wriggling around the corner and she's like super vampire white skin like
[2:58:20.100 --> 2:58:24.260]  Rattles all over not good every seminary and she says like needles on a finger
[2:58:24.260 --> 2:58:30.660]  You know, she saw you and she started just crawling away and she had sores all over her legs from head to toe
[2:58:30.900 --> 2:58:34.020]  And you know all the crew was like, oh, like are you okay?
[2:58:34.020 --> 2:58:36.020]  Like we didn't even see her. We're like, oh
[2:58:36.020 --> 2:58:38.020]  Like a vampire like
[2:58:38.020 --> 2:58:42.420]  Yeah, and then if this other guy just popped out of a random door on the side of the the building as well
[2:58:42.420 --> 2:58:44.420]  And we were just like where are we right now?
[2:58:44.420 --> 2:58:48.340]  What's going on in the house? Yeah, and the dude looked like what are you doing here?
[2:58:49.060 --> 2:58:51.940]  Exactly. He was like, why are y'all here? We're like, why are you here?
[2:58:51.940 --> 2:58:56.020]  Exactly. He was like, why are y'all here? We're like, why are you guys like an eel just came out of a hole?
[2:58:56.980 --> 2:59:01.700]  And I was just like, why are we in downtown Austin right now smelling smelling piss at 9 a.m
[2:59:01.700 --> 2:59:05.780]  This is not how I want to start my day, but it was good. It was good foot. We're not normally doing that
[2:59:05.780 --> 2:59:08.580]  But it was steven Crowder's like come meet us at the capitol so we get there
[2:59:09.140 --> 2:59:11.220]  And he's not there he goes. Oh, we're meeting on 6th street now
[2:59:11.620 --> 2:59:16.260]  Alex wanted to take him to the most homeless ridden nastiest parts of Austin. No, no, that was his idea
[2:59:16.500 --> 2:59:20.820]  He wanted but yeah, you showed him the best parts though. You're like, this is what democrat leadership looks like
[2:59:20.820 --> 2:59:26.580]  There actually is a nice there's actually a nice little river walk here in Austin, but it's completely defiled now
[2:59:26.740 --> 2:59:30.980]  It's just the defaced and defiled and there's a nice little home now
[2:59:31.380 --> 2:59:35.940]  Well, the weirdest thing especially la how many of the homeless people they give hormones to
[2:59:36.580 --> 2:59:41.060]  So you'll see a half naked man with huge breasts now with flies all over them
[2:59:41.620 --> 2:59:47.620]  I'm not kidding. No, I remember the stories because I I do not why the hormone look I I want to be clear
[2:59:47.620 --> 2:59:53.460]  No, no, no, I'm sitting there in in skid row. I can't do an interview and I didn't and they move real slow
[2:59:53.540 --> 2:59:55.540]  I see smoke wriggling around in this
[2:59:55.860 --> 2:59:56.580]  tent
[2:59:56.580 --> 2:59:58.100]  So there's these two
[2:59:58.100 --> 3:00:03.700]  Transsexual men. I remember this story. Yeah, and then so I move away all of a sudden I go I turn around and they're going like
[3:00:04.420 --> 3:00:06.420]  Wriggling around. No, I'm not joking
[3:00:06.500 --> 3:00:09.780]  I'm not joking literally and I look down and it's this
[3:00:10.500 --> 3:00:15.620]  Starving black dude, you can see your spine and the skin looked like melted black candle wax
[3:00:15.620 --> 3:00:22.420]  Like like Adam was worse than a zombie movie with and I look down wearing a skirt with flies all over the genitals
[3:00:22.500 --> 3:00:24.500]  And this is like one second. I like
[3:00:25.380 --> 3:00:28.180]  And I was like that was good row and I'm with these off-duty police
[3:00:28.180 --> 3:00:31.700]  We hired the ones we're like running back in the car at this point. That was skid row
[3:00:32.180 --> 3:00:36.980]  Dude, I've told the story not to be gross folks. No, I I've never seen anything like it
[3:00:37.460 --> 3:00:41.380]  Because it's one thing to see somebody with flies all over them like in some war zone or something
[3:00:41.380 --> 3:00:45.540]  This is someone literally on heroin or fentanyl
[3:00:46.340 --> 3:00:48.340]  Coming towards me like a demon
[3:00:50.340 --> 3:00:55.300]  With with on hormones and heroin. I say here's the problem is we do live in such a prosperous
[3:00:55.860 --> 3:01:01.540]  Society that we shouldn't have that in our society. We don't have that. We have no one has that footage
[3:01:02.100 --> 3:01:06.740]  We have so much in this country. We shouldn't have to deal with that, but it's it's all self-destructed. Yeah, look at this
[3:01:06.740 --> 3:01:11.700]  Well, that's a nice throne. These are real images. I mean, you can't make this stuff up
[3:01:11.860 --> 3:01:14.500]  And this is exactly what's coming to Austin, Texas. Alex. I watched the
[3:01:15.140 --> 3:01:18.580]  2 p.m. Somebody shoot it goes on for hundreds of square miles. It just goes on for miles
[3:01:18.660 --> 3:01:22.100]  We've only got like two blocks of that in Austin right now right now. Give me no
[3:01:23.140 --> 3:01:24.980]  Are you joking? There's like homeless camps everywhere?
[3:01:25.300 --> 3:01:31.940]  Yeah, but I mean like that though like the war like the worst of the worst the drug addicts like the crack down
[3:01:31.940 --> 3:01:36.660]  And you see there's all these new escalades and like you drive by with police. They're like if you're the police
[3:01:36.660 --> 3:01:40.740]  What are you doing? There's a city council doesn't leave it alone. No, I liked your idea actually that you had earlier
[3:01:40.820 --> 3:01:44.820]  I mean, why don't we of course again? They don't do it now. Everything's digital, but it's like, yeah
[3:01:44.980 --> 3:01:46.980]  If we went into city council
[3:01:47.380 --> 3:01:51.620]  During whatever hearing they were having and we just took the mic and started making a scene
[3:01:52.580 --> 3:01:57.060]  Get the police up here immediately. We need the police. But you just said to fund the police
[3:01:57.060 --> 3:02:01.620]  I thought wait, so what are you gonna do? Oh, are you gonna come kick me out yourself? I doubt that
[3:02:02.100 --> 3:02:06.500]  No, I'm gonna start I'm gonna start legally going after the WF. I mean, we need to start pushing back
[3:02:07.700 --> 3:02:11.940]  Um, let's play. What's the name of the sportscaster that laid it out really good a while back never aired it
[3:02:12.340 --> 3:02:16.420]  Marcellus Wiley. Yeah, let's go ahead and roll this. Here's the Marcellus Wiley folks
[3:02:17.380 --> 3:02:20.820]  But Marcellus, I'm gonna start with you. Yeah, is this a good idea?
[3:02:20.820 --> 3:02:30.180]  Uh, it's not a good idea. Um, I do want to give the players credit for their flex to even get this to be more than just an idea
[3:02:30.260 --> 3:02:34.900]  But something that's going to be in reality. I give the players that but
[3:02:35.860 --> 3:02:42.500]  There's a problem with when you start to go down this road of the freedom of expression freedom of speech and
[3:02:43.380 --> 3:02:46.420]  How much social space is allowed for those who don't support
[3:02:46.420 --> 3:02:53.220]  In that same space and that's where I wonder where this is going to go in terms of identity politics
[3:02:53.300 --> 3:02:55.300]  We know what identity politics does
[3:02:55.860 --> 3:03:00.020]  Uh, it divides and it polarizes no matter how you want to look at it
[3:03:00.100 --> 3:03:08.100]  That's just the effect of it no matter how great the intentions are and we all know the road to hell is paved with good intentions
[3:03:08.340 --> 3:03:11.860]  So it's an interesting play right here. I don't know how many people
[3:03:11.860 --> 3:03:18.740]  Really look into the mission statement of black lives matter, but I did and when you look into it, there's a couple things that jumped out
[3:03:19.540 --> 3:03:27.540]  To me and I'm a black man who's been black and my life has mattered since 1974 and this organization was founded in 2013
[3:03:27.860 --> 3:03:33.060]  I'm proud of you, but I've been fighting this fight for me and for others a lot longer
[3:03:33.540 --> 3:03:36.340]  Two things my family structure is so
[3:03:36.340 --> 3:03:41.220]  So vital and important to me not only the one I grew up in but the one I'm trying to create right now
[3:03:41.620 --> 3:03:45.220]  Being a father and a husband. That's my mission in life right now
[3:03:46.260 --> 3:03:50.500]  How do I reconcile that what I just told you with this mission statement that says
[3:03:51.060 --> 3:03:54.340]  Quote we dismantle the patriarchal practice
[3:03:54.980 --> 3:04:01.940]  We disrupt the western prescribed nuclear family structure requirement when I know statistics when I know my reality forget statistics
[3:04:01.940 --> 3:04:06.900]  I knew this before I even went to Columbia and saw these same statistics that I'm going to read to you right now
[3:04:07.540 --> 3:04:13.540]  That children from single-parent homes versus two-parent homes the children from the single-parent homes
[3:04:13.620 --> 3:04:19.380]  This is in 1995. I was reading this five times more likely to commit suicide six times more likely to be in poverty
[3:04:19.620 --> 3:04:22.580]  nine times more likely to drop out of high school 10 times more likely to abuse
[3:04:22.900 --> 3:04:30.260]  Chemical substances 14 times more likely to commit rape 20 times more likely to end up in prison and 32 times more likely to run away from home
[3:04:30.260 --> 3:04:36.820]  I knew that you know why I knew it because a lot of my friends didn't have family structures that were nuclear like mine
[3:04:37.140 --> 3:04:39.140]  And they found themselves
[3:04:39.140 --> 3:04:44.100]  Outside of their dreams and goals and aspirations. So when I see that
[3:04:44.660 --> 3:04:47.620]  Or as a mission statement for black lives matter
[3:04:47.940 --> 3:04:53.300]  It makes me scratch my head when I also see their mission is to eradicate white supremacy
[3:04:54.820 --> 3:04:58.180]  In 2020 white supremacy is the mission
[3:04:58.180 --> 3:05:01.060]  That's a lot of digging through minutia right there
[3:05:01.300 --> 3:05:07.140]  I am on a show that I'm hosting along with another black guy who is hosting Whitney who replaced another black guy
[3:05:07.460 --> 3:05:11.540]  And that's just one example of it. So I understand I respect your space
[3:05:11.860 --> 3:05:17.460]  I respect what you're protesting for but will you respect others who don't support that same protest?
[3:05:17.940 --> 3:05:23.540]  So you rarely see a hole in one 100 perfectly developed three minutes, but that was it. You notice the key he said
[3:05:23.540 --> 3:05:27.460]  I was black before you said you represent me and you own me now
[3:05:27.620 --> 3:05:32.260]  No, I've been around before you came around and I don't agree with what you're doing and what you're saying is the worst thing for people
[3:05:32.500 --> 3:05:34.500]  period Savannah
[3:05:35.140 --> 3:05:41.540]  Well, I just I've seen this too. I worked in urban and youth development in st. Louis. I've seen the difference between
[3:05:42.100 --> 3:05:46.340]  Uh kids in high school and and this is in st. Louis. I mean these are 99 black kids
[3:05:46.340 --> 3:05:50.900]  I'm talking about who had parents in their home cracking the whip on them to do their homework
[3:05:50.900 --> 3:05:56.500]  They ended up going to college. They ended up creating businesses versus unfortunately the ones that would would go up
[3:05:56.980 --> 3:06:01.460]  Filtering from their aunt's house to their grandma's house to maybe their friend's house is drug dealing
[3:06:01.860 --> 3:06:03.860]  They had a lot of problems. They got in trouble
[3:06:04.260 --> 3:06:08.660]  And and and and black look that's the thing black lives matters a nice slogan and they know it
[3:06:08.740 --> 3:06:13.300]  That's why they go with it. This has nothing to do with black lives. Yeah, they don't represent anybody's lives
[3:06:13.300 --> 3:06:17.620]  They represent destroying you Savannah. It's all about division just like over run free just came forward
[3:06:17.620 --> 3:06:24.100]  She's a black what millionaire billionaire billionaire and she said that you know, if you're white you still have an advantage
[3:06:24.340 --> 3:06:29.460]  It's all about keeping the black and people down by giving them this victim hood mentality and making them think that they
[3:06:29.620 --> 3:06:34.020]  Aren't equal in society and saying you got to do with Oprah who works with bill gates
[3:06:34.260 --> 3:06:37.380]  She's in that secret eugenics kill the black people movement. Yep. All right
[3:06:37.460 --> 3:06:42.420]  You got big reports a fan dot videos of nernandez. I'll enjoy her coming up his own show 3 p.m
[3:06:42.740 --> 3:06:44.740]  Don't report for it
[3:06:44.740 --> 3:06:48.180]  Let's go to one in Connecticut. You're on the air. Thanks for holding
[3:06:49.220 --> 3:06:51.220]  I sure can sir. Thank you
[3:06:51.220 --> 3:06:56.580]  Before I start man, I just wanted to talk to you go and it's a pleasure to be talking right now
[3:06:57.140 --> 3:06:59.140]  Sir, it's an honor to talk to you brother
[3:06:59.140 --> 3:07:01.140]  I'm a new brand Connecticut and
[3:07:01.140 --> 3:07:02.740]  I just want to plug in
[3:07:02.740 --> 3:07:08.900]  I'm a truck driver and two before that have changed the way I drive me and me and my my brothers that drive
[3:07:08.900 --> 3:07:14.580]  A couple of us. We are Hispanics Cubans Puerto Ricans. We used to be on
[3:07:15.300 --> 3:07:20.580]  Monster and and red bull and all that and I have lost weight because I stopped drinking all that sugar
[3:07:20.660 --> 3:07:22.900]  And I just want to thank you for that man. Well, brother
[3:07:23.060 --> 3:07:27.620]  We put more in this than any other long-term high quality energy powder there is
[3:07:28.100 --> 3:07:30.420]  So this this was designed on one of the top guys in the country
[3:07:30.420 --> 3:07:32.820]  He didn't want his name on it because obviously the political issues
[3:07:32.820 --> 3:07:35.540]  But we had to pay a lot of money for this formulation just for the design of it
[3:07:35.540 --> 3:07:39.460]  And we believe it is the best strongest but healthiest energy out there
[3:07:39.540 --> 3:07:43.940]  And you're saying that it's made your life better. So that means a lot to me. Thank you to all your truck drivers. We love you

[3:08:42.740 --> 3:08:50.100]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[3:09:04.020 --> 3:09:08.020]  If you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[3:09:08.020 --> 3:09:15.300]  You're listening to the alex jones show and now your host john rapaport
[3:09:21.620 --> 3:09:24.660]  Okay, here we go. We've got a bunch of stories to cover today
[3:09:25.940 --> 3:09:33.380]  Going to see if we can get them all in first a couple of comments about the bay root bombing. These are actually questions
[3:09:33.380 --> 3:09:37.300]  Because it's still very early here
[3:09:37.940 --> 3:09:42.740]  But you'll notice that many reports in the mainstream are talking about huge quantities
[3:09:43.380 --> 3:09:47.140]  Of ammonium nitrate stored at the dock at the port
[3:09:48.020 --> 3:09:50.020]  which blew up
[3:09:50.820 --> 3:09:55.860]  So in my 1995 book on the oklahoma city bombing
[3:09:55.860 --> 3:10:02.820]  Of course the story there was supposedly that rider truck parked at the curb
[3:10:03.780 --> 3:10:09.460]  Was filled with barrels of ammonium nitrate which were set off in an explosion
[3:10:11.060 --> 3:10:13.540]  But that was called an anfo bomb
[3:10:14.340 --> 3:10:18.340]  Which means ammonium nitrate plus fuel oil
[3:10:19.540 --> 3:10:21.540]  And it wasn't just
[3:10:21.540 --> 3:10:26.660]  Fuel oil and a barrel here and ammonium nitrate there. It was a mix
[3:10:27.780 --> 3:10:29.780]  significant mix
[3:10:30.820 --> 3:10:35.860]  So i am hearing nothing about fuel oil in the bay root situation
[3:10:37.300 --> 3:10:39.300]  That's number one
[3:10:40.180 --> 3:10:46.260]  Number two when i spoke with an explosive expert i spoke with several at the time in 1995
[3:10:46.260 --> 3:10:54.260]  About the oklahoma city bombing. He said look if this scenario is correct about
[3:10:55.860 --> 3:11:01.140]  Barrels of ammonium nitrate and fuel oil in the rider truck
[3:11:02.340 --> 3:11:05.620]  These would have to be hooked up by debt cord
[3:11:07.060 --> 3:11:12.500]  Very precisely all the barrels so that they ignite all at once
[3:11:12.500 --> 3:11:15.860]  To get a sustained shock wave
[3:11:16.740 --> 3:11:20.020]  Otherwise you're going to end up with fertilizer all over the street
[3:11:22.500 --> 3:11:26.180]  So the idea of tons and tons of
[3:11:26.820 --> 3:11:30.580]  Ammonium nitrate stored in the port at bay root
[3:11:31.700 --> 3:11:34.820]  I have questions about whether that would be
[3:11:35.700 --> 3:11:36.820]  ignited
[3:11:36.820 --> 3:11:38.820]  all at once
[3:11:38.820 --> 3:11:40.820]  in an explosion
[3:11:40.820 --> 3:11:42.820]  Unless there was some connection
[3:11:44.100 --> 3:11:47.700]  Internal connection hooking all of this substance up
[3:11:49.380 --> 3:11:55.860]  Or if there was some exterior force of sufficient heat perhaps
[3:11:56.820 --> 3:11:58.820]  To blow it up all at once
[3:12:00.340 --> 3:12:05.060]  Fireworks i think you can forget about that which has been promoted a bit
[3:12:05.060 --> 3:12:10.740]  There are questions here about what's happened there serious questions
[3:12:11.940 --> 3:12:15.860]  I would never accept on surface the idea that it's just
[3:12:16.580 --> 3:12:18.820]  Ammonium nitrate and it all blew up
[3:12:20.180 --> 3:12:22.180]  I'm not buying that
[3:12:22.420 --> 3:12:27.380]  Much more investigation here by independent experts is needed
[3:12:28.580 --> 3:12:30.580]  Okay, so let's go to kovat now
[3:12:30.580 --> 3:12:39.860]  Reopening the economies i've been warning for months now that this is a game
[3:12:42.420 --> 3:12:45.220]  We're reopening the economy terrific whatever but
[3:12:46.100 --> 3:12:53.300]  Now we're seeing an escalation of cases so we may have to shut it down again certain states etc etc etc
[3:12:53.860 --> 3:12:55.860]  This is a game they play
[3:12:55.860 --> 3:13:01.780]  Opening the economy escalation of case numbers therefore we have to shut it down again
[3:13:02.900 --> 3:13:05.860]  This is a con. This is a hustle. This is a hoax
[3:13:06.660 --> 3:13:07.460]  Because
[3:13:08.180 --> 3:13:17.060]  There are not escalating case numbers. There's the fabrication of escalating case numbers, which is very easy to do
[3:13:17.380 --> 3:13:22.100]  I've explained at least six or seven different ways it's being done
[3:13:22.100 --> 3:13:30.020]  And therefore it becomes a very viable strategy for relocking down and repunishing
[3:13:30.660 --> 3:13:32.660]  the population
[3:13:32.660 --> 3:13:36.340]  wreaking more economic havoc and destroying more lives
[3:13:36.740 --> 3:13:39.300]  to invent new case numbers
[3:13:40.340 --> 3:13:42.340]  in other words
[3:13:43.140 --> 3:13:45.140]  The serial progression of
[3:13:46.180 --> 3:13:48.180]  reopening economy
[3:13:48.180 --> 3:13:50.180]  escalating case numbers
[3:13:50.180 --> 3:13:52.180]  Have to shut it down
[3:13:52.180 --> 3:13:54.180]  That's not connected
[3:13:54.740 --> 3:13:56.740]  The news media
[3:13:56.740 --> 3:13:58.740]  Make it sound like it's all connected
[3:13:58.740 --> 3:14:03.700]  But that's their job is to take these items that have no meaning
[3:14:04.420 --> 3:14:11.140]  In relationship to each other and wash over the viewer and they can think that it's all connected. It's not
[3:14:12.180 --> 3:14:14.180]  And you have to understand that
[3:14:15.060 --> 3:14:17.300]  And that's even assuming of course that a new
[3:14:17.300 --> 3:14:24.420]  virus was discovered in the first place in China or anywhere else, which I've disputed with evidence for months now
[3:14:25.300 --> 3:14:28.740]  But going into the world where people are convinced
[3:14:29.460 --> 3:14:32.420]  That there is some sort of virus
[3:14:34.180 --> 3:14:39.220]  Still you have an enormous amount of fabrication and invention of case numbers
[3:14:39.700 --> 3:14:45.700]  The PCR test fits out false positives like coins in a real case
[3:14:45.700 --> 3:14:48.260]  Like coins in a rig slot machine
[3:14:49.140 --> 3:14:54.980]  Etc. Etc. And I'll get to the main cgc fabrication of case number
[3:14:55.940 --> 3:14:57.940]  In a little bit here
[3:14:57.940 --> 3:15:00.980]  So keep this in mind don't fall for this con
[3:15:02.180 --> 3:15:06.980]  Oh, we tried to reopen the economy, but you see escalating case numbers prevented it. No
[3:15:08.180 --> 3:15:10.180]  Not true. It's a lie
[3:15:10.180 --> 3:15:18.980]  They're fabricating the case numbers in order to lock down again because locking down an economic destruction
[3:15:19.780 --> 3:15:22.900]  Is in fact the whole point of this
[3:15:23.860 --> 3:15:25.860]  insane and
[3:15:25.860 --> 3:15:27.860]  inhuman exercise
[3:15:28.420 --> 3:15:30.420]  That's it in a nutshell
[3:15:32.260 --> 3:15:34.820]  So let's stay here in the world of
[3:15:37.460 --> 3:15:39.460]  Insanity where
[3:15:39.460 --> 3:15:41.460]  Most people assume
[3:15:41.700 --> 3:15:46.020]  That a new virus has been discovered and it's at loose in the world
[3:15:48.180 --> 3:15:51.300]  If you make that assumption which I don't but if you do
[3:15:52.260 --> 3:15:53.380]  then
[3:15:53.380 --> 3:15:56.900]  How is immunity really attained?
[3:15:58.420 --> 3:16:02.740]  And I've been listening to experts and reading experts on all sides of this
[3:16:04.020 --> 3:16:06.900]  for months now and have come to
[3:16:06.900 --> 3:16:16.020]  Really the only reasonable conclusion about the gaining of immunity on a mass basis
[3:16:17.700 --> 3:16:22.980]  And you can boil it down way down to something that needs no technical
[3:16:23.860 --> 3:16:25.860]  language or gibberish or
[3:16:26.580 --> 3:16:28.580]  gobbledygook to understand
[3:16:29.620 --> 3:16:31.620]  And that is
[3:16:31.620 --> 3:16:40.340]  You attain natural immunity through exposure to germ? Everybody exposure to the germ
[3:16:40.900 --> 3:16:42.740]  That's it
[3:16:42.740 --> 3:16:48.980]  That's the way it would be done if in fact there were a new virus loose in the world
[3:16:49.620 --> 3:16:51.620]  Nothing else works
[3:16:52.340 --> 3:16:54.340]  That works
[3:16:57.300 --> 3:16:59.300]  It's called nature
[3:16:59.300 --> 3:17:06.500]  It's called nature folks. Everything else is a diversion, a distraction and a
[3:17:07.380 --> 3:17:09.380]  delusion
[3:17:09.380 --> 3:17:13.540]  The containment measures, the lockdowns, the mask, the distancing
[3:17:14.340 --> 3:17:20.100]  These do not in any way produce mass immunity to a virus
[3:17:20.980 --> 3:17:22.980]  They postpone in fact
[3:17:23.780 --> 3:17:27.220]  Attaining mass natural immunity to a virus
[3:17:27.220 --> 3:17:29.220]  That's what is going on
[3:17:30.340 --> 3:17:32.340]  With all of these recommendations
[3:17:33.140 --> 3:17:38.180]  I've got more details on the other side of the break about this. It's very important to understand
[3:17:38.660 --> 3:17:40.660]  The subject of natural immunity
[3:17:41.060 --> 3:17:48.660]  We'll be back. I'm really really proud of the Dr. Jones naturals activated charcoal naturally fluoride free mouthwash and toothpaste
[3:17:49.060 --> 3:17:53.460]  And if you don't know what activated charcoal does ladies and gentlemen, it naturally in a clean way
[3:17:53.460 --> 3:18:00.980]  Strips away the toxins, the impurities, the plaque, and it doesn't damage the enamel. That's really important

[3:18:31.780 --> 3:18:34.580]  And I went to my dad people said I would like to put out a charcoal toothpaste

[3:19:37.620 --> 3:19:39.620]  It's not as popular
[3:19:39.620 --> 3:19:47.780]  Ah, anyways, it's all at info more store.com another part of the great awakening that's taking place is people that haven't even been religious or christian
[3:19:48.340 --> 3:19:53.940]  Now see how evil is out in the open how hundreds of churches have been burned in europe and the us
[3:19:54.420 --> 3:19:57.540]  Hundreds of christian icons have been burned destroyed
[3:19:58.180 --> 3:20:02.500]  Jesuses have had their heads cut off all over the country all over the philippines all over europe
[3:20:02.900 --> 3:20:06.180]  Virgin Mary's are getting torn down. I mean crosses are being torn down
[3:20:06.180 --> 3:20:11.220]  It's absolutely out of control, but people now understand that evil was always real
[3:20:11.540 --> 3:20:15.460]  It is spiritual and it was just waiting to make its move
[3:20:15.940 --> 3:20:21.220]  Building beneath the surface and now it's emerged. That's why when I ask listeners and viewers for your prayer. I mean it
[3:20:21.220 --> 3:20:22.340]  I'm praying for america
[3:20:22.340 --> 3:20:25.940]  I'm praying for you and I know the power prayer is real and god hears it
[3:20:26.340 --> 3:20:31.460]  We need to come together and pray for even greater awakening pray for donald trump to be protected
[3:20:31.460 --> 3:20:38.980]  Pray for him to win a landslide and pray for the people under deception of the globalist to awaken and join us in liberty and freedom
[3:20:39.220 --> 3:20:41.220]  God bless you all. Please pray for him for us as well
[3:20:46.020 --> 3:20:48.660]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[3:20:48.660 --> 3:20:50.660]  So
[3:21:01.300 --> 3:21:03.860]  Okay here on the other side of the break john rafferport
[3:21:04.660 --> 3:21:09.380]  He's talking about how people attain natural immunity on a mass basis
[3:21:10.340 --> 3:21:12.340]  And it's through exposure
[3:21:12.340 --> 3:21:16.180]  To a germ if indeed there is a germ loose in the world
[3:21:16.180 --> 3:21:18.180]  That's it
[3:21:19.460 --> 3:21:23.060]  Everything else is complete diversion distraction and nonsense
[3:21:24.260 --> 3:21:27.860]  Now if you want to listen to mainstream reports get a load of this
[3:21:30.260 --> 3:21:36.020]  11 weeks after the onset of the pandemic according to mainstream
[3:21:37.620 --> 3:21:42.180]  There were 30,000 cases worldwide in 99 countries
[3:21:42.180 --> 3:21:45.940]  So if you believe that then you believe
[3:21:46.900 --> 3:21:51.220]  That the spread was explosive completely out of control
[3:21:51.940 --> 3:21:56.580]  In terms of the reach and the extent of this germ
[3:21:57.460 --> 3:22:00.020]  Therefore there would be no way to stop it
[3:22:01.620 --> 3:22:08.020]  Therefore if you try to contain it by locking people down isolating them in their homes
[3:22:08.020 --> 3:22:12.260]  They have to wear masks. They have to distance etc etc etc
[3:22:13.940 --> 3:22:18.900]  Huge numbers of those people are already percolating the virus in their body
[3:22:19.700 --> 3:22:21.700]  Too late
[3:22:21.700 --> 3:22:23.700]  Can't contain it can't stop it
[3:22:23.700 --> 3:22:27.940]  But if you isolate them then you simply postpone the day
[3:22:27.940 --> 3:22:30.420]  When you let them out of jail and then
[3:22:31.140 --> 3:22:36.660]  The virus would begin to re-escalate and jump and spread all over the place
[3:22:36.660 --> 3:22:38.660]  Again
[3:22:38.660 --> 3:22:42.340]  So that doesn't work at all. None of the containment measures work
[3:22:43.060 --> 3:22:48.900]  Again what works is natural exposure of everybody period
[3:22:49.780 --> 3:22:56.420]  So if you accept the mainstream idea, which I do not but I visit that world in order to
[3:22:56.900 --> 3:22:58.900]  Point out its internal
[3:22:59.620 --> 3:23:01.620]  illogic and inconsistency
[3:23:01.620 --> 3:23:07.380]  If you buy the pandemic idea and the virus spreading idea
[3:23:08.580 --> 3:23:10.580]  There's only one thing to conclude
[3:23:12.500 --> 3:23:17.540]  Open the economy completely never lock it down forget distancing forget masks
[3:23:18.260 --> 3:23:20.260]  Expose the entire population
[3:23:21.300 --> 3:23:23.300]  And be done with it
[3:23:23.300 --> 3:23:25.300]  Period
[3:23:25.300 --> 3:23:27.300]  If that had been done
[3:23:27.300 --> 3:23:29.300]  People would be talking about it
[3:23:29.300 --> 3:23:32.020]  Another flu season. That's what they were saying
[3:23:32.660 --> 3:23:36.180]  Oh, yeah, we had a pretty severe flu season and etc etc
[3:23:36.180 --> 3:23:43.620]  Of course, nobody locked down anybody. Everybody went to work. The economy kept rolling, but you see that's not the
[3:23:44.820 --> 3:23:50.260]  Operation that's not the covert up. That's not what the globalists are really after
[3:23:50.820 --> 3:23:57.700]  What the Rockefeller Gates globalists are really after is destroying the world in order to save the world
[3:23:57.700 --> 3:24:00.740]  wrecking the economies in order to bring in a new
[3:24:01.460 --> 3:24:04.260]  Technocratic fascism. That's what they're really all about
[3:24:05.700 --> 3:24:09.460]  Okay, okay, okay and moving right along here
[3:24:11.700 --> 3:24:15.460]  Under reported in the press in America, certainly
[3:24:16.660 --> 3:24:19.460]  We have the fact that last weekend
[3:24:20.660 --> 3:24:23.700]  Protests or one protest
[3:24:23.700 --> 3:24:27.140]  In Berlin was attended by
[3:24:27.700 --> 3:24:31.700]  Estimates vary, but I would peg it at somewhere between
[3:24:32.500 --> 3:24:36.500]  300,000 and 500,000 people in one place
[3:24:37.700 --> 3:24:39.700]  In Berlin
[3:24:39.700 --> 3:24:42.660]  Protesting the entire operation
[3:24:43.700 --> 3:24:46.660]  Of the destruction of the economy
[3:24:47.700 --> 3:24:51.140]  The lockdowns all of the measures that were taken
[3:24:51.140 --> 3:24:53.940]  The lockdowns all of the measures
[3:24:54.660 --> 3:24:56.660]  that have
[3:24:56.660 --> 3:25:00.500]  Put Germany as well as just about every other country in the world
[3:25:01.540 --> 3:25:03.540]  Teetering on the edge of collapse
[3:25:04.500 --> 3:25:06.500]  That's what this protest was about
[3:25:07.300 --> 3:25:13.140]  Of course in certain mainstream outlets, they will say well 17,000 we think maybe that much
[3:25:13.780 --> 3:25:16.740]  Absolutely not absolutely not
[3:25:17.540 --> 3:25:19.540]  And this was a peaceful
[3:25:19.540 --> 3:25:21.540]  Demonstration
[3:25:21.540 --> 3:25:27.540]  On the part of between three to five hundred thousand people in one place in Berlin
[3:25:29.540 --> 3:25:32.660]  And from what I have been hearing
[3:25:33.540 --> 3:25:36.820]  Reports of multiple clashes with the police
[3:25:37.540 --> 3:25:39.540]  Are not true
[3:25:39.540 --> 3:25:42.340]  In fact, the police in many cases
[3:25:43.540 --> 3:25:47.540]  We're helping the demonstrators get organized get put in place
[3:25:47.540 --> 3:25:50.540]  Uh adequately and so on and so forth
[3:25:52.540 --> 3:25:57.540]  People were not wearing masks by and large they were not distancing they were all together
[3:25:57.540 --> 3:26:00.540]  They were saying absolutely no to all of this
[3:26:00.540 --> 3:26:06.540]  Well naturally the mainstream media are not going to highlight this because
[3:26:06.540 --> 3:26:09.540]  It's a breakout it's a breakthrough
[3:26:10.540 --> 3:26:13.540]  It's evidence that massive numbers of people
[3:26:13.540 --> 3:26:17.540]  Are saying no we don't want this we're not going to stand for it
[3:26:18.540 --> 3:26:21.540]  We understand this is fascism brutality
[3:26:22.540 --> 3:26:24.540]  Totalitarian state
[3:26:25.540 --> 3:26:27.540]  Being carried out against us
[3:26:28.540 --> 3:26:30.540]  Under the cover story
[3:26:31.540 --> 3:26:32.540]  Of a virus
[3:26:33.540 --> 3:26:37.540]  Under the cover story of a pandemic under the false narrative
[3:26:37.540 --> 3:26:39.540]  Waking up time folks
[3:26:39.540 --> 3:26:40.540]  Waking up time
[3:26:43.540 --> 3:26:48.540]  So let's get to the CDC definition of a COVID-19 case
[3:26:49.540 --> 3:26:52.540]  I mentioned this last week and it bears repeating
[3:26:55.540 --> 3:26:57.540]  If you read the April
[3:26:58.540 --> 3:26:59.540]  2020
[3:27:00.540 --> 3:27:01.540]  CDC
[3:27:01.540 --> 3:27:06.540]  Spaghetti what I would call spaghetti definition of a COVID-19 case
[3:27:07.540 --> 3:27:10.540]  Because it has five sets of criteria
[3:27:11.540 --> 3:27:18.540]  It's this or that if this that you know one of those ridiculous complex things
[3:27:19.540 --> 3:27:21.540]  You come out with the understanding
[3:27:22.540 --> 3:27:25.540]  That virtually anybody can be carried out
[3:27:25.540 --> 3:27:33.540]  You come out with the understanding that virtually anybody can be diagnosed as COVID-19
[3:27:34.540 --> 3:27:37.540]  Without any kind of test whatsoever
[3:27:38.540 --> 3:27:39.540]  That's right
[3:27:40.540 --> 3:27:42.540]  As ridiculous as the tests are
[3:27:43.540 --> 3:27:46.540]  You don't even need them to make the diagnosis
[3:27:47.540 --> 3:27:48.540]  For example
[3:27:50.540 --> 3:27:52.540]  Chills and fever
[3:27:52.540 --> 3:27:54.540]  Or cough
[3:27:55.540 --> 3:27:56.540]  If taken together
[3:27:58.540 --> 3:28:00.540]  Where the person is said to be
[3:28:01.540 --> 3:28:03.540]  In contact with a
[3:28:04.540 --> 3:28:05.540]  Cohort
[3:28:06.540 --> 3:28:07.540]  Which is at risk
[3:28:08.540 --> 3:28:11.540]  As pronounced by public health authorities
[3:28:12.540 --> 3:28:16.540]  If you satisfy those conditions you could be diagnosed as COVID-19
[3:28:17.540 --> 3:28:18.540]  Chills and fever
[3:28:19.540 --> 3:28:20.540]  Or a cough
[3:28:20.540 --> 3:28:21.540]  Or a cough
[3:28:23.540 --> 3:28:25.540]  Huh? What? Who? Did? What?
[3:28:26.540 --> 3:28:27.540]  That's right
[3:28:28.540 --> 3:28:30.540]  No test of any kind
[3:28:32.540 --> 3:28:34.540]  So with all the fiddling and diddling
[3:28:35.540 --> 3:28:36.540]  That we've been
[3:28:37.540 --> 3:28:38.540]  Describing
[3:28:39.540 --> 3:28:40.540]  For weeks and actually months now
[3:28:41.540 --> 3:28:42.540]  About how the
[3:28:43.540 --> 3:28:45.540]  Case numbers are being cooked and faked
[3:28:46.540 --> 3:28:47.540]  And so on and so forth
[3:28:47.540 --> 3:28:49.540]  Here you have it embedded
[3:28:50.540 --> 3:28:51.540]  In the very definition
[3:28:52.540 --> 3:28:54.540]  The official definition by the CDC
[3:28:55.540 --> 3:28:56.540]  Of a COVID-19 case
[3:28:57.540 --> 3:28:58.540]  It's engraved and sewn
[3:28:59.540 --> 3:29:00.540]  It's institutionalized
[3:29:01.540 --> 3:29:03.540]  It becomes available to any
[3:29:04.540 --> 3:29:06.540]  Medical personnel to use
[3:29:07.540 --> 3:29:08.540]  On a patient
[3:29:09.540 --> 3:29:10.540]  In an office
[3:29:11.540 --> 3:29:12.540]  In a hospital
[3:29:13.540 --> 3:29:14.540]  In a nursing home
[3:29:14.540 --> 3:29:17.540]  And then of course it becomes part of the count
[3:29:18.540 --> 3:29:19.540]  The official count
[3:29:20.540 --> 3:29:21.540]  Of case numbers
[3:29:22.540 --> 3:29:23.540]  Death numbers
[3:29:24.540 --> 3:29:25.540]  Which is trumpeted
[3:29:26.540 --> 3:29:27.540]  By the media
[3:29:28.540 --> 3:29:29.540]  24-7 to scare the population
[3:29:30.540 --> 3:29:32.540]  And make them afraid to go into lockdown mode
[3:29:33.540 --> 3:29:36.540]  Distancing mode, mask mode, etc, etc, etc
[3:29:37.540 --> 3:29:38.540]  Which prolongs
[3:29:40.540 --> 3:29:41.540]  The economic devastation
[3:29:41.540 --> 3:29:44.540]  So that is the CDC definition
[3:29:45.540 --> 3:29:47.540]  Of a COVID-19 case
[3:29:48.540 --> 3:29:50.540]  Which is stunning
[3:29:51.540 --> 3:29:54.540]  If you would just give it a few moments of thought
[3:29:56.540 --> 3:29:57.540]  Okay
[3:29:58.540 --> 3:29:59.540]  Next up
[3:30:01.540 --> 3:30:03.540]  The director of the CDC Robert Redfield
[3:30:05.540 --> 3:30:08.540]  Story today that I've run on no more fake news
[3:30:08.540 --> 3:30:10.540]  Details has sorted past
[3:30:12.540 --> 3:30:14.540]  Now keep in mind that Redfield is now
[3:30:15.540 --> 3:30:16.540]  The director of the CDC
[3:30:17.540 --> 3:30:18.540]  Their main business activity
[3:30:19.540 --> 3:30:21.540]  Is promoting and selling vaccines
[3:30:22.540 --> 3:30:24.540]  Which will apply certainly to
[3:30:25.540 --> 3:30:26.540]  The COVID-19 vaccine
[3:30:27.540 --> 3:30:28.540]  Whenever it is approved
[3:30:29.540 --> 3:30:30.540]  For use
[3:30:31.540 --> 3:30:33.540]  And he is also a key member
[3:30:34.540 --> 3:30:35.540]  Of the White House
[3:30:35.540 --> 3:30:37.540]  Coronavirus Task Force
[3:30:38.540 --> 3:30:39.540]  Vicky Gibbs
[3:30:40.540 --> 3:30:41.540]  57-year-old
[3:30:42.540 --> 3:30:44.540]  Lesbian preacher in Houston
[3:30:45.540 --> 3:30:46.540]  Went in with a cough
[3:30:47.540 --> 3:30:48.540]  Got intubated
[3:30:49.540 --> 3:30:50.540]  And then died
[3:30:51.540 --> 3:30:52.540]  And as soon as I saw her face
[3:30:53.540 --> 3:30:54.540]  As soon as I saw the report
[3:30:55.540 --> 3:30:56.540]  I said watch it'll be innovation
[3:30:57.540 --> 3:30:58.540]  We know what's gonna happen
[3:30:59.540 --> 3:31:00.540]  It's a blue city
[3:31:01.540 --> 3:31:02.540]  Same story yet again
[3:31:02.540 --> 3:31:04.540]  And they say her heart gave out
[3:31:05.540 --> 3:31:07.540]  If you put somebody on a breathing tube
[3:31:08.540 --> 3:31:09.540]  With COVID-19 as a death sentence
[3:31:10.540 --> 3:31:11.540]  It's on record
[3:31:12.540 --> 3:31:13.540]  Before they go to the hospital and get killed
[3:31:14.540 --> 3:31:15.540]  Why are almost all the deaths
[3:31:16.540 --> 3:31:17.540]  Happening in blue cities and blue states
[3:31:18.540 --> 3:31:19.540]  It's because they intubate them
[3:31:20.540 --> 3:31:21.540]  Putting a tube in their lungs
[3:31:22.540 --> 3:31:23.540]  And COVID-19 is causing an autoimmune response
[3:31:24.540 --> 3:31:25.540]  And if you do that with oxygen
[3:31:26.540 --> 3:31:27.540]  The doctors are on record saying
[3:31:28.540 --> 3:31:29.540]  It will kill you
[3:31:29.540 --> 3:31:31.540]  All these doctors in blue cities and blue states
[3:31:32.540 --> 3:31:33.540]  Follow their orders
[3:31:34.540 --> 3:31:35.540]  And the minute I saw this report today
[3:31:36.540 --> 3:31:37.540]  I knew what I would be reading
[3:31:38.540 --> 3:31:40.540]  Don't end up like Vicky Gibbs or everyone
[3:31:41.540 --> 3:31:42.540]  There are a lot of signs
[3:31:43.540 --> 3:31:44.540]  That people are really waking up
[3:31:45.540 --> 3:31:46.540]  To the new world order in global government
[3:31:47.540 --> 3:31:48.540]  But one of the biggest is
[3:31:49.540 --> 3:31:50.540]  Privacy pouches
[3:31:51.540 --> 3:31:52.540]  I've been selling these for more than 10 years
[3:31:53.540 --> 3:31:54.540]  In the old days
[3:31:55.540 --> 3:31:56.540]  They weren't 100% effective
[3:31:56.540 --> 3:31:58.540]  They didn't wait fair day cages
[3:31:59.540 --> 3:32:00.540]  That small phones and even large cell phones
[3:32:01.540 --> 3:32:02.540]  Fit into very very comfortably
[3:32:03.540 --> 3:32:04.540]  And then slip right into your pocket
[3:32:05.540 --> 3:32:06.540]  And these things work great
[3:32:07.540 --> 3:32:08.540]  That way you're not tracked
[3:32:09.540 --> 3:32:10.540]  You're not traced by government
[3:32:11.540 --> 3:32:12.540]  By big corporations, by big tech
[3:32:13.540 --> 3:32:14.540]  By hackers, by criminals
[3:32:15.540 --> 3:32:16.540]  They're selling your data
[3:32:17.540 --> 3:32:18.540]  They're using it against you
[3:32:19.540 --> 3:32:20.540]  AI uses this to be able to predict the future
[3:32:21.540 --> 3:32:22.540]  Manipulate markets
[3:32:23.540 --> 3:32:24.540]  It's critical that everyone

[3:32:26.540 --> 3:32:27.540]  Plus we have a good unit
[3:32:28.540 --> 3:32:29.540]  And it's also a good price
[3:32:30.540 --> 3:32:31.540]  We have it in 4 different colors
[3:32:32.540 --> 3:32:33.540]  It's the privacy pockets

[3:32:36.540 --> 3:32:37.540]  People are really waking up

[3:32:40.540 --> 3:32:41.540]  That folks are aware of this
[3:32:42.540 --> 3:32:43.540]  And are now using these

[3:35:01.540 --> 3:35:02.540]  And we're back here
[3:35:03.540 --> 3:35:04.540]  Talking about Robert Redfield
[3:35:05.540 --> 3:35:06.540]  So he's also a key member
[3:35:07.540 --> 3:35:09.540]  Of the White House Coronavirus Task Force
[3:35:09.540 --> 3:35:10.540]  As well as the head of the CDC
[3:35:12.540 --> 3:35:13.540]  And as everybody knows
[3:35:14.540 --> 3:35:15.540]  The task force is intent
[3:35:16.540 --> 3:35:17.540]  On bringing a vaccine
[3:35:18.540 --> 3:35:19.540]  For COVID-19 to market
[3:35:20.540 --> 3:35:21.540]  So he is in a key position
[3:35:23.540 --> 3:35:24.540]  To promote that vaccine
[3:35:27.540 --> 3:35:28.540]  Well, I ran into
[3:35:30.540 --> 3:35:31.540]  This guy way back in the day
[3:35:32.540 --> 3:35:33.540]  When I was writing my first book
[3:35:34.540 --> 3:35:35.540]  Azink
[3:35:36.540 --> 3:35:37.540]  And followed part of his career
[3:35:37.540 --> 3:35:38.540]  When he was in the army
[3:35:39.540 --> 3:35:40.540]  Doing research
[3:35:41.540 --> 3:35:42.540]  On an AIDS vaccine
[3:35:45.540 --> 3:35:46.540]  He was a joke
[3:35:47.540 --> 3:35:48.540]  He still is a joke
[3:35:49.540 --> 3:35:50.540]  And the army knew about it
[3:35:51.540 --> 3:35:52.540]  And today I published an article
[3:35:53.540 --> 3:35:54.540]  With a long letter
[3:35:55.540 --> 3:35:56.540]  Excerpts from the letter
[3:35:57.540 --> 3:35:58.540]  Sent to congressman
[3:35:59.540 --> 3:36:00.540]  Henry Waxman
[3:36:01.540 --> 3:36:02.540]  This is years ago
[3:36:03.540 --> 3:36:04.540]  About Redfield
[3:36:04.540 --> 3:36:06.540]  And his preposterous
[3:36:07.540 --> 3:36:08.540]  Handling of that research
[3:36:09.540 --> 3:36:10.540]  On a purported AIDS vaccine
[3:36:11.540 --> 3:36:12.540]  Where he was accused
[3:36:13.540 --> 3:36:14.540]  Of faking data
[3:36:15.540 --> 3:36:16.540]  Massaging data
[3:36:17.540 --> 3:36:18.540]  Corrupting data
[3:36:19.540 --> 3:36:20.540]  Etc etc etc
[3:36:21.540 --> 3:36:22.540]  In order to push the idea
[3:36:23.540 --> 3:36:24.540]  Of that AIDS vaccine
[3:36:25.540 --> 3:36:26.540]  The army investigators
[3:36:27.540 --> 3:36:28.540]  Were aware of this
[3:36:29.540 --> 3:36:30.540]  And they made it known
[3:36:31.540 --> 3:36:32.540]  But finally
[3:36:32.540 --> 3:36:33.540]  He let him off the hook
[3:36:35.540 --> 3:36:36.540]  And then began his rise
[3:36:38.540 --> 3:36:39.540]  To political power
[3:36:40.540 --> 3:36:41.540]  As a medical bureaucrat
[3:36:42.540 --> 3:36:43.540]  And this is the guy
[3:36:44.540 --> 3:36:45.540]  Who is standing next to Fauci
[3:36:46.540 --> 3:36:47.540]  In the forefront
[3:36:48.540 --> 3:36:49.540]  Of pushing a COVID-19 vaccine
[3:36:50.540 --> 3:36:51.540]  On the population
[3:36:53.540 --> 3:36:54.540]  Trust him then
[3:36:55.540 --> 3:36:56.540]  Absolutely not
[3:36:57.540 --> 3:36:58.540]  Trust him now
[3:36:59.540 --> 3:37:00.540]  You'd be crazy too
[3:37:00.540 --> 3:37:01.540]  He just warning
[3:37:02.540 --> 3:37:03.540]  Understand
[3:37:04.540 --> 3:37:05.540]  What this guy did years ago
[3:37:06.540 --> 3:37:07.540]  In relation to a vaccine
[3:37:08.540 --> 3:37:10.540]  And now the position that he is in
[3:37:12.540 --> 3:37:13.540]  To be able to
[3:37:15.540 --> 3:37:16.540]  Promote, sell
[3:37:17.540 --> 3:37:18.540]  Even possibly mandate
[3:37:19.540 --> 3:37:20.540]  A vaccine for COVID-19
[3:37:21.540 --> 3:37:22.540]  To the public
[3:37:23.540 --> 3:37:24.540]  And of course
[3:37:25.540 --> 3:37:26.540]  I should mention that the
[3:37:27.540 --> 3:37:28.540]  Task forces favor company
[3:37:28.540 --> 3:37:29.540]  Because there are a number of them
[3:37:30.540 --> 3:37:31.540]  Testing these vaccines right now
[3:37:32.540 --> 3:37:33.540]  Seems to be Moderna
[3:37:36.540 --> 3:37:37.540]  Moderna
[3:37:40.540 --> 3:37:41.540]  This is a company
[3:37:42.540 --> 3:37:43.540]  A very small company
[3:37:44.540 --> 3:37:45.540]  That's never brought a drug
[3:37:46.540 --> 3:37:47.540]  Or a vaccine
[3:37:48.540 --> 3:37:49.540]  Or any product to the market
[3:37:50.540 --> 3:37:51.540]  Ever before
[3:37:52.540 --> 3:37:53.540]  Ever ever ever
[3:37:55.540 --> 3:37:56.540]  And yet
[3:37:56.540 --> 3:37:57.540]  They have garnered
[3:37:58.540 --> 3:37:59.540]  Roughly
[3:38:00.540 --> 3:38:01.540]  Half a billion
[3:38:02.540 --> 3:38:03.540]  Dollars in federal money for research
[3:38:04.540 --> 3:38:05.540]  Half a billion
[3:38:08.540 --> 3:38:09.540]  Fauci likes them
[3:38:10.540 --> 3:38:12.540]  The task force seems to like them
[3:38:13.540 --> 3:38:14.540]  Why?
[3:38:15.540 --> 3:38:16.540]  Because Moderna
[3:38:17.540 --> 3:38:18.540]  Is pushing an RNA vaccine
[3:38:19.540 --> 3:38:21.540]  A technology which has never been
[3:38:22.540 --> 3:38:23.540]  Licensed for public use before
[3:38:23.540 --> 3:38:24.540]  And could it gain
[3:38:25.540 --> 3:38:26.540]  The market now
[3:38:28.540 --> 3:38:30.540]  Why hasn't it gained any approval
[3:38:31.540 --> 3:38:32.540]  Or certification before
[3:38:33.540 --> 3:38:34.540]  People have tried
[3:38:35.540 --> 3:38:36.540]  The answer is obvious
[3:38:37.540 --> 3:38:39.540]  Because it's caused serious problems
[3:38:40.540 --> 3:38:41.540]  And volunteers
[3:38:42.540 --> 3:38:43.540]  In clinical trials
[3:38:44.540 --> 3:38:45.540]  Mostly under the heading
[3:38:46.540 --> 3:38:47.540]  Of autoimmune response
[3:38:48.540 --> 3:38:50.540]  Which means the body basically attacks itself
[3:38:50.540 --> 3:38:51.540]  As if
[3:38:52.540 --> 3:38:54.540]  The body were an enemy of the body
[3:38:56.540 --> 3:38:57.540]  And yet
[3:38:59.540 --> 3:39:01.540]  These people want to foist an RNA vaccine
[3:39:02.540 --> 3:39:03.540]  On the public
[3:39:04.540 --> 3:39:05.540]  As manufactured by Moderna
[3:39:09.540 --> 3:39:10.540]  There is another hidden motive
[3:39:11.540 --> 3:39:12.540]  For Bill Gates and Fauci
[3:39:13.540 --> 3:39:14.540]  And others behind this
[3:39:15.540 --> 3:39:17.540]  Once they can get RNA testing
[3:39:17.540 --> 3:39:18.540]  Approved
[3:39:19.540 --> 3:39:20.540]  And enter the marketplace
[3:39:21.540 --> 3:39:22.540]  For the first time
[3:39:23.540 --> 3:39:24.540]  Then
[3:39:25.540 --> 3:39:26.540]  They broke in the ice
[3:39:27.540 --> 3:39:28.540]  Then they can say
[3:39:29.540 --> 3:39:31.540]  We can now use this for any vaccine
[3:39:32.540 --> 3:39:33.540]  And why is that important to them?
[3:39:34.540 --> 3:39:36.540]  Because the manufacturing process
[3:39:37.540 --> 3:39:38.540]  Is much quicker and easier
[3:39:39.540 --> 3:39:40.540]  And cheaper
[3:39:41.540 --> 3:39:42.540]  So for the next
[3:39:43.540 --> 3:39:44.540]  50 vaccine available
[3:39:44.540 --> 3:39:45.540]  Viruses that they claim
[3:39:46.540 --> 3:39:48.540]  To have discovered out of the blue
[3:39:49.540 --> 3:39:50.540]  They can immediately turn around
[3:39:51.540 --> 3:39:52.540]  And say, well, we can have a vaccine
[3:39:53.540 --> 3:39:54.540]  Ready in three or four months
[3:39:55.540 --> 3:39:56.540]  Bang bang bang bang bang
[3:39:57.540 --> 3:39:58.540]  Because it's going to be an RNA vaccine
[3:39:59.540 --> 3:40:00.540]  And we can make it very quickly
[3:40:01.540 --> 3:40:03.540]  And that means they want to continually
[3:40:04.540 --> 3:40:05.540]  Shoot up people
[3:40:06.540 --> 3:40:07.540]  With all manner of toxic
[3:40:08.540 --> 3:40:09.540]  Elements and substances
[3:40:10.540 --> 3:40:11.540]  From here on into the future
[3:40:11.540 --> 3:40:13.540]  And if you really want to get
[3:40:14.540 --> 3:40:15.540]  Technical about it
[3:40:16.540 --> 3:40:17.540]  Not science fiction
[3:40:18.540 --> 3:40:19.540]  But technical
[3:40:20.540 --> 3:40:21.540]  You would be talking about nano-vaccine
[3:40:22.540 --> 3:40:23.540]  The implantation
[3:40:24.540 --> 3:40:25.540]  Of tiny, tiny, tiny particles
[3:40:26.540 --> 3:40:27.540]  That have been found
[3:40:28.540 --> 3:40:29.540]  By researchers in Italy
[3:40:30.540 --> 3:40:31.540]  I reported on this
[3:40:32.540 --> 3:40:33.540]  And I'm going to talk about it
[3:40:34.540 --> 3:40:35.540]  And I'm going to talk about it
[3:40:36.540 --> 3:40:37.540]  And I'm going to talk about it
[3:40:38.540 --> 3:40:39.540]  And I'm going to talk about it
[3:40:39.540 --> 3:40:40.540]  I reported on this
[3:40:41.540 --> 3:40:42.540]  To be contaminating already
[3:40:43.540 --> 3:40:45.540]  Many, many mainstream vaccines
[3:40:46.540 --> 3:40:47.540]  By the biggest manufacturers
[3:40:48.540 --> 3:40:49.540]  In the world
[3:40:50.540 --> 3:40:51.540]  Here you would have
[3:40:52.540 --> 3:40:53.540]  Nanoparticles intentionally placed
[3:40:54.540 --> 3:40:55.540]  In vaccines
[3:40:56.540 --> 3:40:57.540]  That would function in the body
[3:40:59.540 --> 3:41:00.540]  As both
[3:41:01.540 --> 3:41:02.540]  Broadcasters of data
[3:41:03.540 --> 3:41:04.540]  From the body out
[3:41:05.540 --> 3:41:06.540]  And receivers of data
[3:41:06.540 --> 3:41:07.540]  Or instructions
[3:41:08.540 --> 3:41:09.540]  Into the body and the brain
[3:41:11.540 --> 3:41:12.540]  That is the holy grail
[3:41:13.540 --> 3:41:14.540]  Of nano-research
[3:41:15.540 --> 3:41:16.540]  To be able to do this
[3:41:17.540 --> 3:41:18.540]  In other words
[3:41:19.540 --> 3:41:22.540]  To have a real-time surveillance
[3:41:23.540 --> 3:41:24.540]  Of every human
[3:41:25.540 --> 3:41:26.540]  From inside that human's body
[3:41:28.540 --> 3:41:29.540]  Okay
[3:41:30.540 --> 3:41:31.540]  And also to
[3:41:32.540 --> 3:41:34.540]  Broadcast and plant instructions
[3:41:34.540 --> 3:41:36.540]  From the outside to that human
[3:41:37.540 --> 3:41:39.540]  Through these nano-sensors in the body
[3:41:41.540 --> 3:41:42.540]  Thereby
[3:41:44.540 --> 3:41:45.540]  Changing behavior
[3:41:46.540 --> 3:41:47.540]  Changing response
[3:41:48.540 --> 3:41:49.540]  To stimuli
[3:41:50.540 --> 3:41:51.540]  Changing all sorts of
[3:41:52.540 --> 3:41:53.540]  Factors
[3:41:54.540 --> 3:41:55.540]  About humans
[3:41:56.540 --> 3:41:57.540]  That's where this is going
[3:41:58.540 --> 3:41:59.540]  That's what it's all about
[3:42:01.540 --> 3:42:02.540]  Because the vaccine
[3:42:02.540 --> 3:42:03.540]  Is a convenient excuse
[3:42:05.540 --> 3:42:06.540]  For injecting
[3:42:07.540 --> 3:42:08.540]  Or spraying
[3:42:09.540 --> 3:42:10.540]  Depending upon the root of transmission
[3:42:13.540 --> 3:42:14.540]  All manner of substances
[3:42:15.540 --> 3:42:16.540]  Into the body
[3:42:17.540 --> 3:42:18.540]  Under the false heading of
[3:42:19.540 --> 3:42:20.540]  It's wonderful for you
[3:42:21.540 --> 3:42:22.540]  It'll heal, it'll prevent
[3:42:23.540 --> 3:42:24.540]  All kinds of good things will happen
[3:42:25.540 --> 3:42:26.540]  And you must have it
[3:42:27.540 --> 3:42:28.540]  Of course, because
[3:42:29.540 --> 3:42:30.540]  This is a way to gain control
[3:42:30.540 --> 3:42:31.540]  Because
[3:42:32.540 --> 3:42:33.540]  This is a way to gain immunity
[3:42:34.540 --> 3:42:35.540]  To COVID-19
[3:42:36.540 --> 3:42:37.540]  Horror story, horror story, horror story
[3:42:38.540 --> 3:42:39.540]  Solution, solution, solution
[3:42:40.540 --> 3:42:41.540]  Understand?
[3:42:42.540 --> 3:42:43.540]  Get this
[3:42:44.540 --> 3:42:45.540]  This is
[3:42:46.540 --> 3:42:47.540]  The holy grail of medical dictatorship
[3:42:49.540 --> 3:42:50.540]  To have control of the population
[3:42:51.540 --> 3:42:52.540]  To such a degree
[3:42:53.540 --> 3:42:54.540]  That a vaccine can be
[3:42:55.540 --> 3:42:56.540]  Literally sold to 7 billion people
[3:42:57.540 --> 3:42:58.540]  As being necessary
[3:42:58.540 --> 3:42:59.540]  And people will line up
[3:43:00.540 --> 3:43:01.540]  Around the block
[3:43:02.540 --> 3:43:03.540]  A dozen times
[3:43:04.540 --> 3:43:05.540]  In order to just get it
[3:43:06.540 --> 3:43:07.540]  And believe that they are now protected
[3:43:08.540 --> 3:43:09.540]  From something
[3:43:10.540 --> 3:43:11.540]  When that is obviously not the case
[3:43:12.540 --> 3:43:13.540]  And to return to what I was saying
[3:43:14.540 --> 3:43:15.540]  At the top here
[3:43:16.540 --> 3:43:17.540]  Of this hour
[3:43:19.540 --> 3:43:20.540]  If you go into the insane world
[3:43:21.540 --> 3:43:22.540]  Where so many people believe
[3:43:23.540 --> 3:43:24.540]  That there is this unique virus
[3:43:25.540 --> 3:43:26.540]  Loose in the world
[3:43:26.540 --> 3:43:27.540]  And get immunity from that
[3:43:28.540 --> 3:43:29.540]  Forget about the whole idea
[3:43:30.540 --> 3:43:31.540]  Of vaccination
[3:43:32.540 --> 3:43:33.540]  Even if you buy vaccination theory
[3:43:34.540 --> 3:43:35.540]  Which I don't
[3:43:36.540 --> 3:43:37.540]  Because conventional researchers
[3:43:38.540 --> 3:43:39.540]  Are now reporting
[3:43:40.540 --> 3:43:41.540]  That so-called immunity
[3:43:42.540 --> 3:43:43.540]  From COVID-19
[3:43:44.540 --> 3:43:45.540]  Which they measure
[3:43:46.540 --> 3:43:47.540]  In terms of antibody response
[3:43:48.540 --> 3:43:49.540]  Wanes and declines very quickly
[3:43:50.540 --> 3:43:51.540]  In people
[3:43:52.540 --> 3:43:53.540]  Therefore, we're not even talking
[3:43:53.540 --> 3:43:54.540]  About a one-shot vaccine
[3:43:55.540 --> 3:43:56.540]  For the population
[3:43:57.540 --> 3:43:58.540]  We're talking about something
[3:43:59.540 --> 3:44:00.540]  On the order of the flu vaccine
[3:44:01.540 --> 3:44:02.540]  That would have to have boosters
[3:44:03.540 --> 3:44:04.540]  Every year. Are you kidding?
[3:44:05.540 --> 3:44:06.540]  It's not even vaguely doable
[3:44:07.540 --> 3:44:08.540]  You're going to inoculate
[3:44:09.540 --> 3:44:10.540]  Or somehow inflict a vaccine
[3:44:11.540 --> 3:44:12.540]  On 7 billion people every year
[3:44:13.540 --> 3:44:14.540]  Forget it
[3:44:16.540 --> 3:44:17.540]  In addition to the fact of
[3:44:18.540 --> 3:44:19.540]  How is the flu vaccine working out
[3:44:20.540 --> 3:44:21.540]  As a comparison
[3:44:21.540 --> 3:44:22.540]  Here, according to official statistics
[3:44:23.540 --> 3:44:24.540]  At any rate, we're talking about
[3:44:25.540 --> 3:44:26.540]  Millions of cases all over the world
[3:44:27.540 --> 3:44:28.540]  And hundreds of thousands of deaths
[3:44:29.540 --> 3:44:30.540]  So that's not working at all
[3:44:32.540 --> 3:44:33.540]  And why would we expect anything
[3:44:34.540 --> 3:44:35.540]  Different from a conventional
[3:44:37.540 --> 3:44:38.540]  Or otherwise COVID-19 vaccine
[3:44:39.540 --> 3:44:40.540]  So as far as the, you know,
[3:44:43.540 --> 3:44:44.540]  Dumb to down conventional hope
[3:44:45.540 --> 3:44:46.540]  Of attaining immunity
[3:44:47.540 --> 3:44:48.540]  To COVID-19 from a vaccine
[3:44:48.540 --> 3:44:50.540]  Forget about it, it's ridiculous
[3:44:51.540 --> 3:44:52.540]  It's insane, it doesn't add up
[3:44:53.540 --> 3:44:54.540]  It's meaningless
[3:44:56.540 --> 3:44:57.540]  It's a pipe dream
[3:44:58.540 --> 3:44:59.540]  A twisted pipe dream
[3:45:00.540 --> 3:45:01.540]  Even in conventional terms
[3:45:06.540 --> 3:45:07.540]  This is what happens, you see
[3:45:08.540 --> 3:45:09.540]  And I'll wrap it up here
[3:45:10.540 --> 3:45:11.540]  When you visit the insane world
[3:45:13.540 --> 3:45:14.540]  Where people are absolutely convinced
[3:45:15.540 --> 3:45:16.540]  That a virus is a disease
[3:45:16.540 --> 3:45:17.540]  And they're absolutely convinced
[3:45:18.540 --> 3:45:19.540]  That a virus is loose in the world
[3:45:20.540 --> 3:45:21.540]  And is killing all kinds of people
[3:45:22.540 --> 3:45:23.540]  When you look at that closely
[3:45:24.540 --> 3:45:25.540]  There's all kinds of insane
[3:45:26.540 --> 3:45:27.540]  Contradictions in that viewpoint
[3:45:28.540 --> 3:45:29.540]  It doesn't need anything
[3:45:29.540 --> 3:45:45.540]  We're done
