[00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.995]  I'm out here doing the work of Jesus Christ.
[00:00:44.682 --> 00:00:46.864]  This is Savannah Hernandez for Action 7 News.
[00:00:46.864 --> 00:00:59.514]  I'm here in downtown Austin, Texas, where behind me, Steven Crowder is asking residents here if Black Lives Matter is a domestic terrorist organization, or he's arguing his Change My Mind segment with locals here.
[00:00:59.514 --> 00:01:11.244]  Now, as you guys can see behind me as well, there is quite a few people that live in Austin that I've already talked to, so I wanted to do my own man on the street here and ask people what they've been thinking about the BLM protests that have ravaged our city, and how city council died.
[00:01:11.244 --> 00:01:13.066]  It started out as a peaceful protest.
[00:01:13.786 --> 00:01:18.989]  And then after those few days, it became very violent, and that's when I believe it became a terrorist organization.
[00:01:18.989 --> 00:01:25.053]  In a sense, it's similar to Antifa being a terrorist organization, similar to the KKK being a terrorist organization.
[00:01:25.053 --> 00:01:25.693]  It's all racial.
[00:01:25.693 --> 00:01:28.535]  It's all one race fighting another race at the end of the day.
[00:01:28.535 --> 00:01:30.696]  There's two sides to every argument.
[00:01:30.696 --> 00:01:32.797]  I'm trying to understand.
[00:01:32.797 --> 00:01:35.619]  I've seen and heard the things why black lives matter.
[00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:41.962]  When I look at you, when I look at him, look at her, look at him, look at him, I don't see male, female, black, white, Hispanic.
[00:01:41.962 --> 00:01:42.863]  I see energy.
[00:01:43.583 --> 00:01:44.604]  I'm wearing a mask.
[00:01:44.604 --> 00:01:47.808]  Please wear a mask to protect those around you.
[00:01:47.808 --> 00:01:50.330]  It's not just about you.
[00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.973]  Matter of fact, it really isn't at all right now.
[00:01:52.973 --> 00:01:54.194]  So please wear a f***ing mask.
[00:01:54.194 --> 00:01:55.676]  Thank you for listening.
[00:01:55.676 --> 00:01:58.939]  First of all, it's Black Lives Matter!
[00:02:05.169 --> 00:02:06.450]  The zipper's unbuttoned, b****.
[00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:13.475]  You can't even cover your d**k and cover your face and that's how dumb a d**k is?
[00:02:13.475 --> 00:02:14.315]  Shut up!
[00:02:14.315 --> 00:02:20.660]  Last night people protesting in Minneapolis escalated mass demonstrations.
[00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.642]  We're left beside tear gas.
[00:02:29.224 --> 00:02:32.066]  Could you ask us to stop disrupting so we can keep having discussions?
[00:02:32.066 --> 00:02:33.067]  I think that's productive.
[00:02:33.067 --> 00:02:39.331]  The reason that I'm not going to is because this narrative is dangerous, and this narrative got Garret Foster murdered.
[00:02:39.331 --> 00:02:41.873]  You know what you're doing, and if you don't, then you need to leave.
[00:02:47.498 --> 00:02:51.461]  The police report says that he did have an AK-47 and the guy was riding for Uber.
[00:02:51.461 --> 00:02:52.742]  So I'm sorry.
[00:02:52.742 --> 00:02:55.685]  I didn't have anything to do with Garret Foster being killed.
[00:02:55.685 --> 00:02:57.767]  But just because of that, I think we might set up shop.
[00:02:57.767 --> 00:03:01.270]  And I actually think that that's a valid self-defense, not shooting right there.
[00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:06.035]  If someone storms your car and you're being booted while you're in your car, and someone comes up with an AK-47 aiming at you...
[00:03:19.614 --> 00:03:23.576]  Oh my gosh, look at their new song.
[00:04:00.053 --> 00:04:01.935]  Kill yourself!
[00:04:01.935 --> 00:04:05.479]  Kill yourself, man!
[00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:06.481]  Kill yourself!
[00:04:06.481 --> 00:04:08.623]  I'll have them announced to me!
[00:04:08.623 --> 00:04:12.187]  I'll have them announced to me!
[00:04:12.187 --> 00:04:13.709]  Kill yourself!
[00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:14.970]  Listen to me, man.
[00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.535]  Be sure to come to your next location, and we'll be there.
[00:04:21.059 --> 00:04:22.580]  Is that not a problem?
[00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.200]  Is that not a problem?
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.962]  Of course it's not, because y'all scaring me.
[00:05:00.643 --> 00:05:03.305]  I have never been so concerned about what's going on.
[00:05:03.305 --> 00:05:14.553]  This is all martial law prepping, martial law training, and now they have activated the most criminal elements, the deep state, and Pelosi is bragging they're going to remove the President illegally with COG.
[00:05:14.553 --> 00:05:15.994]  You cannot remove the President with COG.
[00:05:15.994 --> 00:05:20.937]  You can't remove the President, 25th Amendment or impeachment, but they're saying they're going to do it.
[00:05:20.937 --> 00:05:29.423]  Ladies and gentlemen, they are putting this in every newspaper in the country and legitimizing the fact that if he contests the election in any way, when they say by default they are,
[00:05:30.023 --> 00:05:31.104]  They're going to pull this.
[00:05:31.104 --> 00:05:33.706]  This is maximum, maximum alert.
[00:05:33.706 --> 00:05:34.947]  This is emergency alert.
[00:05:34.947 --> 00:05:38.910]  Yes, they've censored the Patriots off most of the internet, but Band-Odd Video is still there.
[00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:40.071]  The radio show is still there.
[00:05:40.071 --> 00:05:44.354]  And yes, we're getting about five times the traffic we were getting before the ban to the actual sites.
[00:05:44.354 --> 00:05:48.037]  But we need to get this message to other people outside of our audience.
[00:05:48.037 --> 00:05:52.160]  So tell everyone now about the Marshall Law Plan and the plan to get rid of Trump.
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.342]  It's all posted at Band-Odd Video.
[00:05:54.342 --> 00:05:56.063]  Please, we can defeat these people.
[00:05:56.063 --> 00:05:58.185]  If you take action, you are the answer.
[00:05:58.185 --> 00:05:59.606]  Please, please, please.
[00:06:27.905 --> 00:06:36.553]  There is a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example.
[00:06:36.553 --> 00:06:51.186]  Alex Jones, the far-right conspiracy theorist who is apparently... Alex Jones!
[00:06:51.186 --> 00:06:52.327]  Scum!
[00:06:52.327 --> 00:06:53.548]  Russian scum!
[00:07:02.346 --> 00:07:04.127]  Reputation's amazing.
[00:07:04.127 --> 00:07:05.467]  I will not let you down.
[00:07:05.467 --> 00:07:08.509]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[00:07:28.421 --> 00:07:36.512]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones.
[00:07:36.512 --> 00:07:37.733]  Move, bitch!
[00:07:37.733 --> 00:07:38.754]  Get out the way!
[00:07:40.578 --> 00:07:46.744]  We pledge allegiance to one flag, and that flag is the American flag.
[00:07:46.744 --> 00:07:50.987]  Infowars helped fuel the rumor that President Obama is an ISIS supporter.
[00:07:50.987 --> 00:07:54.671]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning.
[00:07:54.671 --> 00:07:56.132]  I will not let you down.
[00:07:56.132 --> 00:07:59.275]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[00:07:59.275 --> 00:08:00.436]  And I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[00:08:01.857 --> 00:08:03.577]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones.
[00:08:03.577 --> 00:08:08.660]  This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States.
[00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:11.241]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:08:11.241 --> 00:08:12.242]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:08:15.686 --> 00:08:19.390]  Over the past few weeks, we've heard a lot about the drug hydroxychloroquine.
[00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:20.111]  It's called hydroxychloroquine.
[00:08:20.111 --> 00:08:20.671]  Hydroxychloroquine.
[00:08:20.671 --> 00:08:22.513]  Hydroxychloroquine.
[00:08:22.513 --> 00:08:24.015]  Hydroxychloroquine.
[00:08:24.015 --> 00:08:25.256]  Hydroxychloroquine.
[00:08:25.256 --> 00:08:26.478]  Hydroxychloroquine.
[00:08:26.478 --> 00:08:27.539]  Hydroxychloroquine.
[00:08:27.539 --> 00:08:28.900]  Hydroxychloroquine.
[00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:29.841]  Hydroxychloroquine.
[00:08:29.841 --> 00:08:30.682]  Hydroxychloroquine.
[00:08:30.682 --> 00:08:32.084]  It is called hydroxychloroquine.
[00:08:32.084 --> 00:08:32.944]  Hydroxychloroquine.
[00:08:32.944 --> 00:08:34.206]  Hydroxychloroquine.
[00:08:34.206 --> 00:08:35.647]  Hydroxychloroquine.
[00:08:35.647 --> 00:08:36.088]  Try it.
[00:08:37.743 --> 00:08:39.304]  Yes, try it if you like it.
[00:08:39.304 --> 00:08:43.828]  And if you're worried about the side effects, just remember, Donald Trump is a doctor.
[00:08:43.828 --> 00:08:45.109]  I'm not a doctor.
[00:08:45.109 --> 00:08:46.249]  Okay, my mistake.
[00:08:46.249 --> 00:08:50.433]  How do you calibrate being enthusiastic and not playing doctor?
[00:08:50.433 --> 00:08:52.794]  Because I want people to live.
[00:08:52.794 --> 00:08:55.516]  And I'm seeing people dying.
[00:08:55.516 --> 00:08:59.299]  And I've seen people that are going to die without it.
[00:08:59.299 --> 00:09:00.400]  What?
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.181]  We've got the treatment.
[00:09:02.181 --> 00:09:03.902]  We're gonna cure it.
[00:09:03.902 --> 00:09:05.864]  We're gonna... What?
[00:09:07.486 --> 00:09:09.287]  He was just making that shit up?
[00:09:09.287 --> 00:09:10.528]  I feel good about it.
[00:09:10.528 --> 00:09:19.013]  Turns out, actual doctors do not suggest taking hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 because there is no evidence yet to suggest it protects against the virus.
[00:09:19.013 --> 00:09:21.275]  I don't think we could definitively say it works.
[00:09:21.275 --> 00:09:30.681]  Not only was Fauci mocking President Trump for talking about it, but you had Governor Whitmer in Michigan threatening physicians, I'll take your license if you prescribe hydroxychloroquine.
[00:09:31.869 --> 00:09:35.812]  And telling pharmacists, don't fill any prescriptions for hydroxychloroquine.
[00:09:35.812 --> 00:09:44.580]  And while many on the left are using the coronavirus outbreak to attack President Trump, one Democrat state lawmaker is crediting him with saving her life.
[00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:50.785]  If President Trump had not talked about this, it would not be something that's accessible for anyone to be able to get that right now.
[00:09:50.785 --> 00:09:57.731]  Because I did have a difficult time even that day obtaining the medication because of an order that was put down in my state.
[00:09:57.731 --> 00:09:58.492]  It saved my life.
[00:09:58.672 --> 00:10:05.096]  I want to tell you about a 96-year-old man in Florida who said one night, I don't think I'm going to make it.
[00:10:05.096 --> 00:10:06.096]  I feel very weak.
[00:10:06.096 --> 00:10:07.497]  The end is coming.
[00:10:07.497 --> 00:10:08.097]  I'm coughing.
[00:10:08.097 --> 00:10:08.918]  I'm short of breath.
[00:10:08.918 --> 00:10:10.679]  I can't get up from the couch.
[00:10:10.679 --> 00:10:15.742]  The next day, he was on hydroxychloroquine and antibiotics per his cardiologist.
[00:10:15.742 --> 00:10:16.902]  He got up the next day.
[00:10:16.902 --> 00:10:18.003]  He was fine.
[00:10:18.003 --> 00:10:19.544]  This man is my father.
[00:10:19.544 --> 00:10:21.625]  Hydroxychloroquine.
[00:10:21.625 --> 00:10:26.248]  Why is any network running these press conferences where he keeps talking about
[00:10:27.228 --> 00:10:33.291]  An unproven drug that might work for malaria, might work for lupus, doesn't work for this.
[00:10:33.291 --> 00:10:36.092]  A lot of people would say, follow the money.
[00:10:36.092 --> 00:10:44.315]  There's got to be some sort of financial tie to someone somewhere that has the president pushing this repeatedly.
[00:10:44.315 --> 00:10:48.177]  Turns out he has a financial stake in the company that makes the drug.
[00:10:49.053 --> 00:10:49.853]  Of course he does.
[00:10:49.853 --> 00:10:51.634]  The press, honestly, is out of control.
[00:10:51.634 --> 00:10:53.655]  The level of dishonesty is out of control.
[00:10:53.655 --> 00:10:59.998]  They pulled the video of doctors in lab coats talking about coronavirus research, and they hid that video from the public.
[00:10:59.998 --> 00:11:01.979]  This is just a lot of misinformation.
[00:11:01.979 --> 00:11:03.780]  We don't want a drug pusher for president.
[00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:10.863]  Gene Robinson, you write in the Washington Post, the one word that proves why President Trump should not be president, what is it?
[00:11:11.687 --> 00:11:13.068]  Hydroxychloroquine.
[00:11:13.068 --> 00:11:14.369]  Hydroxychloroquine.
[00:11:14.369 --> 00:11:21.353]  Experts say there isn't enough clinical data to show it's effective for coronavirus, and it has some serious side effects.
[00:11:21.353 --> 00:11:26.877]  The terrible publicity this drug has received just relentlessly over the past three weeks.
[00:11:26.877 --> 00:11:29.179]  This is a crackpot cure.
[00:11:29.179 --> 00:11:30.259]  This is snake oil.
[00:11:30.259 --> 00:11:32.000]  We've got the treatment.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.501]  We're gonna cure it.
[00:11:33.501 --> 00:11:38.284]  Do you think that has made physicians hesitant to try it as a therapy?
[00:11:38.284 --> 00:11:40.466]  No, I think physicians go with what works.
[00:11:40.746 --> 00:11:44.469]  Anecdotal evidence straight from patients' mouths are attesting to its success.
[00:11:44.469 --> 00:11:46.331]  And here's what I consider to be the secret weapon.
[00:11:46.331 --> 00:11:49.153]  Hydroxychloroquine.
[00:11:49.153 --> 00:11:51.375]  I don't think we can definitively say it works.
[00:11:51.375 --> 00:11:55.058]  Well, add my name to those personal accounts, because I am feeling better.
[00:11:55.058 --> 00:11:57.841]  You guys saved my life, and you know you did.
[00:12:00.433 --> 00:12:03.294]  If I could cover my face with my hands, I would.
[00:12:03.294 --> 00:12:06.636]  You're prescribing it, and it is working for COVID-19 patients.
[00:12:06.636 --> 00:12:12.899]  Every patient I've prescribed it to has been very, very ill, and within 8 to 12 hours, they were basically symptom-free.
[00:12:12.899 --> 00:12:16.340]  And so, clinically, I am seeing a resolution.
[00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:17.481]  There's treatment.
[00:12:17.481 --> 00:12:18.561]  That's what we're here to tell you.
[00:12:18.561 --> 00:12:19.902]  It's incredibly effective.
[00:12:19.902 --> 00:12:21.423]  This virus has a cure.
[00:12:21.423 --> 00:12:23.904]  It's called hydroxychloroquine, zinc, and zitromax.
[00:12:24.104 --> 00:12:29.310]  You're going to come on here and talk about how this is a good treatment, when doctors have said, no it's not.
[00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:34.115]  What the problem is, in a lot of those studies, they did very, very high doses, massive doses.
[00:12:34.115 --> 00:12:35.917]  Big tech censored science.
[00:12:35.917 --> 00:12:38.881]  Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube took the video down.
[00:12:39.141 --> 00:12:45.446]  They pulled the video of doctors in lab coats talking about coronavirus research, and they hid that video from the public.
[00:12:45.446 --> 00:12:55.113]  I tell all of you doctors that are sitting down and watching Americans die, you're like the good Nazi, the good what, the good Germans that watch Jews get killed and do not speak up.
[00:12:55.113 --> 00:12:56.234]  I believe I'm one of them.
[00:12:56.234 --> 00:13:04.401]  There are many thousands of physicians who have been silenced for telling the American people the good news about the situation, that we can manage the virus.
[00:13:04.401 --> 00:13:07.203]  You can kill me, you can do whatever, but I'm not going to let Americans die.
[00:13:12.336 --> 00:13:14.117]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're live.
[00:13:14.117 --> 00:13:16.918]  89 days out from the election.
[00:13:16.918 --> 00:13:18.018]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:13:18.018 --> 00:13:20.700]  August 5th, 2020, on this Monday edition.
[00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:31.544]  And the name of the video that you just saw that's extremely powerful, as opposed to the banned-out video, is, Why is Big Tech So Afraid of This Report?
[00:13:31.544 --> 00:13:32.364]  It only has 123,000 views.
[00:13:32.364 --> 00:13:36.906]  It needs to have about 10 million views to save lives.
[00:13:36.906 --> 00:13:38.187]  By the way, it's very frustrating
[00:13:40.097 --> 00:13:43.698]  To see the public's unbelievable ignorance.
[00:13:43.698 --> 00:13:51.602]  I used to go out and do a little man-on-the-street bit, like jaywalking, where I would give people the scientific name for salt.
[00:13:51.602 --> 00:13:56.564]  And I would say, don't we need to ban, and then give the scientific name for salt.
[00:13:56.564 --> 00:13:59.265]  And almost everyone would say, yes, we need to ban it.
[00:13:59.265 --> 00:14:03.766]  Including one guy had a chemistry degree, he said from Cornell.
[00:14:03.766 --> 00:14:07.268]  When I confronted him with that, Lee Ann McAdoo did a similar report.
[00:14:08.766 --> 00:14:15.556]  You can also give out the scientific name for H2O, and it sounds very toxic.
[00:14:15.556 --> 00:14:18.440]  And most people will say that water needs to be banned.
[00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:20.724]  Of course, I didn't invent that.
[00:14:20.724 --> 00:14:22.046]  It was Penn and Teller.
[00:14:23.424 --> 00:14:27.525]  Back in like 1999, I had a TV show that was on HBO.
[00:14:27.525 --> 00:14:29.485]  But boy, was HBO different back then.
[00:14:29.485 --> 00:14:32.746]  And they went out and were debunking man-made global warming.
[00:14:32.746 --> 00:14:41.548]  We're saying, well, if we're going to ban carbon dioxide, let's ban... And then they would give the scientific name for water.
[00:14:41.548 --> 00:14:45.249]  It's a dihydrogen monoxide.
[00:14:45.249 --> 00:14:46.610]  Sounds pretty scary.
[00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:47.450]  Scientific name is salt.
[00:14:48.732 --> 00:14:49.412]  Looked that up too.
[00:14:49.412 --> 00:14:52.053]  Guys, actually print me off a sign of a name for water and salt.
[00:14:52.053 --> 00:14:54.833]  I'm gonna actually show that when we come back.
[00:14:54.833 --> 00:15:00.414]  Okay, I am sweating like a pig because I was out on the Austin streets for a couple hours.
[00:15:00.414 --> 00:15:01.674]  Much of it with Steven Crowder.
[00:15:01.674 --> 00:15:03.054]  I just got back.
[00:15:03.054 --> 00:15:04.155]  I got on the show late.
[00:15:04.155 --> 00:15:05.555]  I apologize to the crew.
[00:15:05.555 --> 00:15:09.095]  Very stressful for them when I show up five minutes into the show already beginning.
[00:15:09.095 --> 00:15:12.496]  But we had important reports and promos to run.
[00:15:12.496 --> 00:15:15.276]  And so I've got all these articles to go over, all this huge news.
[00:15:15.276 --> 00:15:18.357]  But I was already thinking about just coming in here today and talking about
[00:15:19.957 --> 00:15:20.377]  We're good to go.
[00:15:42.159 --> 00:15:46.602]  A toll-free number for you to call in on this Wednesday transmission.
[00:15:46.602 --> 00:15:55.009]  And then we have all the other incredible news here, where they're now, Democrat cities are announcing, and states, they're going to set up checkpoints.
[00:15:55.009 --> 00:15:59.272]  Make sure you follow the COVID rules, and that's getting you ready for the forced inoculations.
[00:15:59.272 --> 00:16:11.202]  States cracking down on social gatherings, says CNN, because Fauci says if we don't, we'll see further surges in coronavirus positives.
[00:16:11.482 --> 00:16:20.466]  Because they're only ramping up the testing, and because the tests have been designed at the Wuhan lab, it turns out, to be completely fraudulent.
[00:16:20.466 --> 00:16:30.791]  They cook the whole thing up, offshore, in a communist dictatorship, with Fauci, Bill Gates, and the CHICOMS, to be directed by the UN as a giant planetary
[00:16:31.351 --> 00:16:45.396]  Power grab and now it's all over the news that indeed Bill Gates has developed digital tattoos under your skin and so is Google and they're deploying them at the airports next year where you'll have to have it to be able to travel.
[00:16:45.396 --> 00:16:54.559]  Oh and then soon to leave your house or go in a grocery store and the contact tracers work for Bill and Melinda Gates and the Clintons and they're gonna come to your house and make sure you're inoculated.
[00:16:54.559 --> 00:16:57.180]  Yes we're now inside the mark of the beast.
[00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:58.320]  Resist or be enslaved.
[00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:02.904]  The reasons that the globalists launch this planetary lockdown.
[00:17:02.904 --> 00:17:07.087]  The number one reason is it serves every one of their purposes.
[00:17:07.087 --> 00:17:11.551]  We've gone over those purposes many times here on air.
[00:17:11.551 --> 00:17:17.616]  The cashless society, the surveillance system, global government, medical tyranny, forced inoculation.
[00:17:17.616 --> 00:17:23.842]  But the most important facet is it teaches us that we are obsolete, that we are non-essential.
[00:17:24.767 --> 00:17:37.916]  As we begin to witness automation computers and robots take over the jobs that people once had by design, this isn't like it's some advancement that we just fell into.
[00:17:37.916 --> 00:17:43.300]  It's been pre-planned, organized globally, and it's extremely predatory.
[00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:54.488]  And through governmental actuaries and tax programs and regulations, the central banks that control it all are able to pick the winners and the losers and consolidate power.
[00:17:55.071 --> 00:18:02.117]  This is the truest form of technocracy fascism.
[00:18:02.117 --> 00:18:04.759]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:18:20.875 --> 00:18:24.279]  On Lebanon, you called this an attack.
[00:18:24.279 --> 00:18:27.844]  Are you confident that this was an attack and not an accident?
[00:18:27.844 --> 00:18:30.187]  Well, it seemed like it, based on the explosion.
[00:18:30.187 --> 00:18:34.492]  I've met with some of our great generals, and they just seemed to feel that it was.
[00:18:34.492 --> 00:18:39.257]  This was not some kind of a manufacturing
[00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:46.754]  Now, many times Trump comes out and tells you it's a bomb before the intelligence agencies come out and say it.
[00:18:46.754 --> 00:18:50.476]  Because he's allowed to declassify whatever he wants under the National Security Act of 1947.
[00:18:50.476 --> 00:18:52.917]  Just like the President can
[00:19:07.435 --> 00:19:08.356]  Give people pardons.
[00:19:08.356 --> 00:19:09.177]  That's what we do.
[00:19:09.177 --> 00:19:14.661]  We the people elect someone who has an ace in the hole, an ace of spades card to play.
[00:19:14.661 --> 00:19:18.184]  And the left always acts like the president doesn't have that power.
[00:19:18.184 --> 00:19:21.027]  The president can do whatever he wants as long as we don't impeach him.
[00:19:21.027 --> 00:19:21.767]  It's up to us.
[00:19:21.767 --> 00:19:28.313]  And if we the people's congress believes what he's done is wrong, and we can prove it was bad, then he can be removed.
[00:19:28.313 --> 00:19:31.055]  But he's not above the law.
[00:19:31.055 --> 00:19:32.977]  He represents we the people and our law.
[00:19:35.077 --> 00:19:38.820]  Now, first they said fireworks.
[00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:42.783]  Then they said no, it was a munitions facility.
[00:19:42.783 --> 00:19:46.286]  And we've had munitions facilities blow up in the United States before.
[00:19:46.286 --> 00:19:49.088]  Well, they've had a couple in Houston blow up.
[00:19:49.088 --> 00:19:53.752]  They had one time an ammonium nitrate ship blow up, a fertilizer, and it was ten times bigger than this.
[00:19:53.752 --> 00:19:56.614]  I mean, it was a mushroom cloud at 50,000 feet.
[00:19:56.614 --> 00:19:59.696]  It just blew up.
[00:19:59.696 --> 00:20:01.438]  Dozens of square miles completely were destroyed.
[00:20:01.438 --> 00:20:02.959]  So, this stuff goes on.
[00:20:04.315 --> 00:20:07.158]  But in the Middle East, you know, there's a lot of terrorism that goes on.
[00:20:07.158 --> 00:20:15.066]  And Beirut's got a lot of Islamic slash Christian infighting going on there in Lebanon.
[00:20:15.066 --> 00:20:20.272]  And Trump would not say that unless the military had intel that
[00:20:21.997 --> 00:20:24.138]  If terrorists are going to target something, that's what you want to target.
[00:20:24.138 --> 00:20:34.663]  You want to target an explosives or fireworks factory because then all you got to do is get a hand grenade to go off inside close proximity to high explosives.
[00:20:34.663 --> 00:20:47.009]  It will cause a chain reaction on an atomic or hydrogen nuclear, thermonuclear, but one with TNT type effect.
[00:20:47.009 --> 00:20:48.950]  We've got overhead shots of this.
[00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:50.731]  You can see the port of your TV viewer before.
[00:20:51.715 --> 00:20:56.037]  You can see after, looks like a giant asteroid hit it.
[00:20:56.037 --> 00:20:59.618]  But you notice those buildings still stood up to the blast.
[00:20:59.618 --> 00:21:05.241]  The Oklahoma City building had columns in the back blown out, but not in the front because there were bombs inside.
[00:21:05.241 --> 00:21:07.702]  The fuel truck was just a distraction.
[00:21:07.702 --> 00:21:10.443]  Continuing though, look at this headline.
[00:21:10.443 --> 00:21:17.706]  A country that depends on its imports to survive has officially lost its main seaport amid famine, COVID-19, and economic collapse.
[00:21:18.561 --> 00:21:22.025]  Well, it's not the economic collapse caused by COVID.
[00:21:22.025 --> 00:21:26.710]  It's an economic collapse and famine caused by the hysteria.
[00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:30.134]  Yeah, people are starving to death all over the world now.
[00:21:30.134 --> 00:21:33.919]  We wear our masks because we're heroes and keep the economy going.
[00:21:33.919 --> 00:21:38.504]  Beirut explosion leaves up to 300,000 homeless, similar to Hiroshima, says their governor.
[00:21:39.775 --> 00:21:43.516]  But notice, you never hear about the COVID-19 deaths in statistics.
[00:21:43.516 --> 00:21:53.500]  It's always, oh, this old lady died, or this child died, and you learn the child had a brain tumor and cancer and was on death's doorstep, and they just test them and say they had COVID.
[00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:56.001]  They get the extra $53,000 or $52,000 that they get, and that's all come out, but they don't care.
[00:22:00.438 --> 00:22:07.183]  In the very cities that sent sick people into nursing homes to actually get some death numbers, it was over 40% until they stopped giving out the numbers.
[00:22:07.183 --> 00:22:14.388]  Now Michigan, now New York, now Pennsylvania, California, they're not releasing nursing home deaths.
[00:22:14.388 --> 00:22:15.489]  That's criminal.
[00:22:15.489 --> 00:22:16.710]  But you know, that's what Venezuela does.
[00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:22.975]  When they were up to 2,000 a week starving to death, they made it illegal to release death certificates.
[00:22:22.975 --> 00:22:24.295]  It was about five years ago.
[00:22:24.295 --> 00:22:25.656]  So that's just how the commies do it.
[00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:27.731]  They just don't give you the numbers anymore.
[00:22:27.731 --> 00:22:33.576]  Kinda like the media won't report on the 20-something people killed a day on the weekend in Chicago, black on black.
[00:22:33.576 --> 00:22:33.876]  And now...
[00:22:35.074 --> 00:22:35.294]  Of course.
[00:23:05.314 --> 00:23:07.156]  When they get assaulted.
[00:23:07.156 --> 00:23:12.681]  And black people in black neighborhoods know that now the thugs just have free reign because the cops are slow rolling.
[00:23:12.681 --> 00:23:14.823]  Because they don't want to get put in prison.
[00:23:14.823 --> 00:23:16.925]  If God forbid they do something, we don't.
[00:23:16.925 --> 00:23:19.087]  I mean, they called the police on George Floyd.
[00:23:19.087 --> 00:23:21.029]  Black people did.
[00:23:21.029 --> 00:23:24.693]  And he was obviously on meth and fentanyl, which was in his system.
[00:23:24.693 --> 00:23:27.916]  Enough fentanyl to kill two men his size.
[00:23:27.916 --> 00:23:30.298]  And he is horrified, panic attacking.
[00:23:32.683 --> 00:23:37.165]  It's very frightening to see what people are like when they're mixing, I guess speed balling is what they call it.
[00:23:37.165 --> 00:23:39.166]  And those frightening dash cam still images.
[00:23:39.166 --> 00:23:42.007]  I watched the whole tape and he's like, I'm scared.
[00:23:42.007 --> 00:23:42.847]  Sit with me.
[00:23:42.847 --> 00:23:43.847]  I'm having claustrophobia.
[00:23:43.847 --> 00:23:48.209]  I can't breathe when he's outside, when he's inside the vehicle.
[00:23:48.209 --> 00:23:49.790]  Before he says, lay me down on the street.
[00:23:50.711 --> 00:23:52.171]  Then a crowd shows up to attack the cop.
[00:23:52.171 --> 00:23:53.452]  The cop's not thinking.
[00:23:53.452 --> 00:23:57.053]  Normally, putting your foot on one karate will make somebody pass out.
[00:23:57.053 --> 00:23:58.754]  It won't kill them, generally.
[00:23:58.754 --> 00:24:02.795]  And then he just had a heart attack right there and died from all the drugs in his system.
[00:24:02.795 --> 00:24:04.616]  Those cops knew him.
[00:24:04.616 --> 00:24:06.696]  I've never seen police kiss somebody's ass like this.
[00:24:06.696 --> 00:24:09.017]  I mean, it was like he was just a baby.
[00:24:09.017 --> 00:24:10.618]  They were, oh, I'll sit with you.
[00:24:10.618 --> 00:24:12.078]  OK, OK.
[00:24:12.078 --> 00:24:12.858]  All right, all right.
[00:24:12.858 --> 00:24:15.679]  It goes on and on and on and on.
[00:24:15.679 --> 00:24:17.280]  So let me tell you who killed him.
[00:24:19.053 --> 00:24:21.696]  It was the Chi-Coms that shipped in that fentanyl.
[00:24:21.696 --> 00:24:24.658]  And I guess the dad not being at home when he was a little kid.
[00:24:24.658 --> 00:24:25.879]  And drug addiction.
[00:24:25.879 --> 00:24:29.203]  And the people in the black owned shop.
[00:24:29.203 --> 00:24:35.589]  When he was in there causing trouble and passing fake $100 bills.
[00:24:35.589 --> 00:24:38.992]  It's like an Antifa lady was attacking some lady, some white lady.
[00:24:38.992 --> 00:24:40.533]  A white lady's attacking another white lady.
[00:24:40.533 --> 00:24:41.574]  And the white woman stabs her.
[00:24:42.492 --> 00:24:43.612]  In the chest.
[00:24:43.612 --> 00:24:45.893]  And the woman goes, police, get over here and help me.
[00:24:45.893 --> 00:24:47.113]  You say kill the police.
[00:24:47.113 --> 00:24:48.934]  You say you don't want the police.
[00:24:48.934 --> 00:24:54.256]  And then as soon as somebody stabs your fat ass, because you're physically attacking them, you don't know what to do.
[00:24:54.256 --> 00:24:58.537]  Hey, little newsflash to all you tough guy, anti-fuzz, and all you thugs and criminals.
[00:24:58.537 --> 00:25:01.798]  Hard-working, regular people are the folks that will kill you in a fight.
[00:25:01.798 --> 00:25:03.599]  Like this little business lady.
[00:25:03.599 --> 00:25:06.339]  Somebody's trying to assault her, she's going to kill you.
[00:25:06.339 --> 00:25:07.740]  She's not looking for trouble, she'll kill you.
[00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:15.404]  And that's what people are going to find out is, I mean, if I was that woman and more people are in my face, boom, I'll stab you too.
[00:25:15.404 --> 00:25:19.607]  And I'll teach my daughters, people are assaulting you, stab them.
[00:25:19.607 --> 00:25:20.687]  Shoot them.
[00:25:20.687 --> 00:25:24.630]  I mean, this is not acceptable for people to thug out and attack whoever they want.
[00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:29.252]  And the woman's, leave me alone, back off.
[00:25:29.252 --> 00:25:33.175]  And the other woman's trying to hit her, so she stabbed her in the chest.
[00:25:33.175 --> 00:25:34.996]  That woman's lucky, that woman didn't know what she was doing.
[00:25:37.688 --> 00:25:42.369]  It's all you got to do with a knife, folks, is everything is speed.
[00:25:42.369 --> 00:25:43.249]  Everything is speed.
[00:25:43.249 --> 00:25:47.550]  Just like you can take a dowel in your kid, a little stick, and cut other branches with it.
[00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:48.750]  It's how fast you're swinging.
[00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:51.411]  All you do is just... right through those guts.
[00:25:51.411 --> 00:25:57.052]  And anybody out there is going to leave you alone when their guts have got about a 7-inch cut in them, and the guts start coming out.
[00:25:57.052 --> 00:25:58.652]  They'll live, but they're going to leave you alone real quick.
[00:25:58.652 --> 00:26:02.453]  Now, if you want to kill them... Right in the carotid.
[00:26:02.453 --> 00:26:02.813]  Bam!
[00:26:02.813 --> 00:26:04.133]  You're dead.
[00:26:04.133 --> 00:26:04.453]  Bye-bye.
[00:26:06.015 --> 00:26:07.636]  You know, a lot of people like to shank people.
[00:26:07.636 --> 00:26:09.357]  Stab, stab, stab, stab, stab.
[00:26:09.357 --> 00:26:11.579]  And that's usually if you're assaulting someone and they're on you.
[00:26:11.579 --> 00:26:12.340]  Yeah, that's what you do.
[00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:13.981]  They usually get off you pretty quick.
[00:26:13.981 --> 00:26:15.402]  I've been stabbed a couple times.
[00:26:15.402 --> 00:26:20.185]  People have started it, but... You know, that's just how it works, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:26:20.185 --> 00:26:22.547]  And... Anyways, I'm digressing.
[00:26:22.547 --> 00:26:23.348]  Let me give the number out.
[00:26:26.078 --> 00:26:27.199]  877-789-2539.
[00:26:27.199 --> 00:26:28.579]  877-789-Alex.
[00:26:28.579 --> 00:26:30.179]  877-789-2539.
[00:26:30.179 --> 00:26:35.300]  And we'll get you up and on the air on this live Wednesday edition.
[00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:35.540]  877-789-2539.
[00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:39.621]  We've got a ton of news to cover.
[00:26:39.621 --> 00:26:44.582]  NYC imposed COVID checkpoints to enforce quarantine order.
[00:26:44.582 --> 00:26:46.663]  Just like they wouldn't let families see their
[00:26:47.930 --> 00:26:53.091]  Parents and others in nursing homes, so they kill them quietly and get all that money.
[00:26:53.091 --> 00:26:55.352]  Bunch of dirty, murdered criminals.
[00:26:55.352 --> 00:26:57.652]  We don't stand up to them, so that makes us accomplices.
[00:26:57.652 --> 00:26:59.172]  The people are awakening.
[00:26:59.172 --> 00:27:01.893]  They're taking control of their own environment.
[00:27:01.893 --> 00:27:03.973]  Cell phones are an amazing tool.
[00:27:03.973 --> 00:27:06.314]  Really, they're a supercomputer that's handheld.
[00:27:06.314 --> 00:27:15.676]  But big tech, large corporations, hackers, governments, foreign governments, the Chai Coms especially, are using this to steal your data, to share your data.
[00:27:15.956 --> 00:27:24.525]  To be able to rig markets when they're able to scoop up billions of people's data, they can actually predict on record what's going to happen in mass movements.
[00:27:24.525 --> 00:27:31.272]  Cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates their AI takeover.
[00:27:31.272 --> 00:27:32.713]  In their own words, they admit it.
[00:27:32.713 --> 00:27:37.118]  Show, I've been selling privacy pouches and locket pockets and things like that for more than a decade.
[00:27:37.598 --> 00:27:39.539]  And now the units have gotten really lightweight.
[00:27:39.539 --> 00:27:40.619]  They're Faraday cages.
[00:27:40.619 --> 00:27:42.319]  They just look like a cloth envelope.
[00:27:42.319 --> 00:27:44.300]  They work absolutely great.
[00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:53.442]  And it just gives you that security to have power over your data and power over your identity when you are traveling and don't want Big Brother to know what you're up to because it's none of their business.

[00:28:59.195 --> 00:28:59.515]  We're good.
[00:29:18.436 --> 00:29:22.217]  The stuff you come up with is just unbelievable.
[00:29:22.217 --> 00:29:23.217]  We'd like you to be in movies.
[00:29:23.217 --> 00:29:24.477]  We'd like you to write with us.
[00:29:24.477 --> 00:29:26.418]  We'd like you to do voiceovers.
[00:29:26.418 --> 00:29:27.638]  You're just a renaissance man.
[00:29:27.638 --> 00:29:31.239]  Folks know I was in some movies and Harry Shearer made statements like that and a lot of others.
[00:29:31.239 --> 00:29:32.539]  I'm not bragging.
[00:29:32.539 --> 00:29:33.580]  And I kept explaining to them.
[00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:35.540]  I said, do you understand?
[00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:37.641]  I didn't come up with any of this.
[00:29:37.641 --> 00:29:41.982]  I'm reading globalist MIT white papers and futurist documents.
[00:29:41.982 --> 00:29:44.902]  And they would just laugh at me and say, oh, no way.
[00:29:44.902 --> 00:29:46.703]  Then I would give them the documents.
[00:29:46.703 --> 00:29:47.943]  They would get very, very scared.
[00:29:48.285 --> 00:29:52.350]  You know, the next time I saw him in a few months, I'd say, man, you're right, this is dystopic.
[00:29:52.350 --> 00:29:55.073]  Folks, I didn't make any of this up, okay?
[00:29:55.073 --> 00:30:00.460]  It's real, it's real.
[00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:03.124]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:30.063]  Give me back my bullets.
[00:30:30.063 --> 00:30:32.204]  Give me back my bullets.
[00:30:32.204 --> 00:30:34.045]  That was a real civil war, Sarge.
[00:31:04.578 --> 00:31:12.043]  Alright, let's get into it.
[00:31:12.043 --> 00:31:26.011]  I was telling Steven Crowder just about an hour and a half ago, or less, that hey, they have a city council proposal in the budget to blow up the police station with plastic explosives.
[00:31:26.906 --> 00:31:29.887]  And you know, Crowder thought I was making it up.
[00:31:29.887 --> 00:31:33.567]  Then I had a former Austin police officer, one of our security guys there, and he said, no, it's real.
[00:31:33.567 --> 00:31:35.227]  And we were pulling it up for him.
[00:31:35.227 --> 00:31:37.448]  He's just, my God, this is insane.
[00:31:37.448 --> 00:31:39.368]  He scrolled down, there's the Infowars.com article.
[00:31:39.368 --> 00:31:42.249]  It's got a copy of the proposed budget right there.
[00:31:42.249 --> 00:31:46.229]  Can't make this up, okay?
[00:31:46.229 --> 00:31:50.510]  Two city council members said, maybe we shouldn't abolish all police.
[00:31:50.510 --> 00:31:53.631]  So they went to their houses and basically threatened to kill him.
[00:31:53.631 --> 00:31:55.271]  Soros just got his top guy.
[00:31:56.459 --> 00:32:02.003]  Put in as the city attorney who says he's a communist and the police shouldn't even exist.
[00:32:02.003 --> 00:32:03.644]  I mean, that's on the news.
[00:32:03.644 --> 00:32:05.346]  Straight faced.
[00:32:05.346 --> 00:32:07.948]  People go, Alex, I thought you got a problem with the police.
[00:32:07.948 --> 00:32:19.916]  I had a problem when Clinton and Bush had them being trained by the ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center to say, we're getting ready for a war.
[00:32:19.916 --> 00:32:25.821]  The gun owners and we're going to confiscate the guns and we need armored vehicles to fight the constitutional terrorist.
[00:32:28.015 --> 00:32:38.243]  Now what happened was, all that training, sitting the police down, and we've shown these manuals, we've shown video here countless times.
[00:32:38.243 --> 00:32:43.608]  He wrote the MIAC reports where they said, you know, Ron Paul's a terrorist, and I'm a terrorist, and Chuck Baldwin's a terrorist.
[00:32:43.608 --> 00:32:46.010]  Remember all those?
[00:32:46.010 --> 00:32:46.850]  Where they said the U.N.
[00:32:46.850 --> 00:32:49.412]  will take control of the police departments, strong cities.
[00:32:49.412 --> 00:32:53.736]  I mean, people used to hear me on the radio talking about this, and they thought, there's no way that's true.
[00:32:53.736 --> 00:32:54.657]  Now it's all over the news.
[00:32:56.209 --> 00:32:56.669]  And the U.N.
[00:32:56.669 --> 00:33:01.032]  says what treatments we can have for COVID-19, and the U.N.'
[00:33:01.012 --> 00:33:02.713]  's in the news lecturing U.S.
[00:33:02.713 --> 00:33:07.596]  kids now about cigarettes, and they're in the news lecturing about partying, because the U.N.'
[00:33:07.576 --> 00:33:09.517]  's like your daddy now.
[00:33:09.517 --> 00:33:12.159]  Oh, get dads out of the house, but you got the U.N.'
[00:33:12.139 --> 00:33:14.020]  's your daddy now.
[00:33:14.020 --> 00:33:15.761]  You just wake up the world government.
[00:33:15.761 --> 00:33:20.003]  But what am I getting at here?
[00:33:20.003 --> 00:33:23.566]  I'm going to go down to the city council, and I'm serious.
[00:33:24.685 --> 00:33:31.490]  This week or next week, let's have a rally and let's call for the city council building to be blown up.
[00:33:31.490 --> 00:33:33.051]  That's crazy!
[00:33:33.051 --> 00:33:36.094]  Let me tell you, that city council is what's not essential.
[00:33:36.094 --> 00:33:38.496]  That city council's run by the globalists.
[00:33:38.496 --> 00:33:41.758]  That city council, that building's just a building.
[00:33:41.758 --> 00:33:48.223]  The left's always about blowing... I've seen some of the news about, we need to blow up all old plantation houses.
[00:33:48.223 --> 00:33:49.404]  What the hell does that mean?
[00:33:52.233 --> 00:33:59.699]  I saw where the Deadpool actor was in the news going, 8 years ago I got married in the Carolinas in an old plantation.
[00:33:59.699 --> 00:34:03.663]  I apologize.
[00:34:03.663 --> 00:34:08.066]  The same people don't own it that owned it 170 years ago.
[00:34:08.066 --> 00:34:09.547]  It's all the virtues signaling.
[00:34:09.547 --> 00:34:14.672]  So they're saying we officially want to blow up the police department.
[00:34:14.672 --> 00:34:16.873]  Well I want it put on the city council.
[00:34:18.033 --> 00:34:28.761]  Citizens Communications that they're all obsolete, they're all non-essential, and since they say we're obsolete, and our business is non-essential, and the police are non-essential, then I want these cops out of here!
[00:34:28.761 --> 00:34:34.525]  And when I'm done with my three minutes, oh I'm sorry, they don't physically let you in the building anymore, do they?
[00:34:34.525 --> 00:34:38.828]  That's the lockdown, that's the new system where you can't get into government, they're separated from you.
[00:34:38.828 --> 00:34:43.051]  But imagine if I stayed there and ran up and grabbed the microphone and took over, they'd go, Police!
[00:34:43.051 --> 00:34:44.211]  Arrest him!
[00:34:44.211 --> 00:34:46.233]  Oh, now the police are essential.
[00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:54.403]  So I think we really should call for Adler to be recalled.
[00:34:54.403 --> 00:34:58.446]  And I call for him to be thrown out of the W. He's up living on the top penthouse.
[00:34:58.446 --> 00:35:02.268]  And I call for the W to be boycotted until he's gone.
[00:35:02.268 --> 00:35:08.793]  And I call for people to start going in the W and making scenes in there.
[00:35:08.793 --> 00:35:12.655]  Every Friday and Saturday night till Adler has his ass thrown out of there.
[00:35:12.655 --> 00:35:14.436]  Because he's not essential.
[00:35:14.436 --> 00:35:18.219]  He's an un-American, globalist, riding Chai Com ding-a-ling.
[00:35:24.555 --> 00:35:26.338]  I've had enough, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:35:26.338 --> 00:35:35.690]  I've absolutely had enough.
[00:35:35.690 --> 00:35:37.792]  Imagine the arrogance of these people.
[00:35:38.752 --> 00:36:07.513]  to tell us that police are non-essential everywhere so they can take the budget and give it to their commie groups and they admit in all these blue cities, oh we're going to give money to Antifa to be overwatch for the city and we're going to give money to all our pals and all these groups like Ilhan Omar says we're going to abolish the Minneapolis police and then we're going to create a new group under her because that woman can't build a civilization because the minute
[00:36:09.446 --> 00:36:11.767]  She comes from pirate slaver stock.
[00:36:11.767 --> 00:36:13.248]  Most of Africa isn't pirate slavers.
[00:36:13.248 --> 00:36:16.670]  It's the Somalis that sold more black people than anybody else on earth.
[00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:17.551]  That particular tribe.
[00:36:17.551 --> 00:36:19.812]  That's why she's part white.
[00:36:19.812 --> 00:36:23.594]  But you notice, they weren't just selling black slaves.
[00:36:23.594 --> 00:36:25.675]  They were grabbing people all over the Caribbean.
[00:36:25.675 --> 00:36:27.817]  All over the Mediterranean, excuse me.
[00:36:27.817 --> 00:36:29.558]  Later they brought them to the Caribbean.
[00:36:29.558 --> 00:36:31.959]  All over the Mediterranean.
[00:36:31.959 --> 00:36:33.100]  And so she's a ruler.
[00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:35.821]  She believes she has a right to rule you.
[00:36:35.821 --> 00:36:36.642]  She's better than you.
[00:36:36.642 --> 00:36:37.502]  You're cattle.
[00:36:37.502 --> 00:36:38.383]  You're slaves to her.
[00:36:42.967 --> 00:36:45.908]  And so as soon as she gets there, she then starts trying to take over.
[00:36:45.908 --> 00:36:48.988]  She doesn't want to build anything.
[00:36:48.988 --> 00:36:54.429]  She wants to siphon off millions of dollars for multiple husbands and multiple campaign companies.
[00:36:54.429 --> 00:36:55.830]  Because she's a crook.
[00:36:55.830 --> 00:36:58.230]  It's what a pirate does.
[00:36:58.230 --> 00:37:01.811]  It's what a slaver does.
[00:37:01.811 --> 00:37:05.232]  You notice when they wore all that Tutankhamen stuff.
[00:37:06.243 --> 00:37:27.934]  They got on their knees, the Senators picked that particular symbol of African royalty from that particular area of the East Coast of Northern Africa, and it was the actual ruling class that sold black slaves as far away as the Pacific Ocean, as far away as Indonesia,
[00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:33.504]  And then they would sell slaves for silk.
[00:37:33.504 --> 00:37:45.400]  And so the wealth of one of those woven silk scarves would be the equivalent of like $20 million, it's estimated, today in money.
[00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:46.862]  And so the very scarf they wear
[00:37:49.141 --> 00:38:16.597]  That's why you can go to the Pacific Islands everywhere and they test people's blood and it's a mix of Asians and Africans and some Caucasian because the Islamic slave traders for at least 1400 years, they didn't really get going for about 200, sold white slaves, black slaves and other slaves from the Mediterranean all over
[00:38:18.643 --> 00:38:20.964]  The Pacific Ocean.
[00:38:20.964 --> 00:38:23.204]  They didn't go as far as Hawaii.
[00:38:23.204 --> 00:38:24.865]  That's why you see the natives in Hawaii.
[00:38:24.865 --> 00:38:27.726]  They're not part African.
[00:38:27.726 --> 00:38:32.608]  But you go to other areas of the Pacific Ocean, I mean, you get off and there's islands of black people everywhere.
[00:38:32.608 --> 00:38:34.588]  Where the hell do you think they came from?
[00:38:34.588 --> 00:38:42.711]  They got loaded up by the Somalis and they got shipped over a thousand years ago.
[00:38:44.787 --> 00:38:48.390]  You know, some of the most interesting stuff I ever read, I got into it for about four years.
[00:38:48.390 --> 00:38:49.971]  I've been into a lot of different history back when I had time.
[00:38:49.971 --> 00:38:53.294]  For about four years, I got into British naval histories.
[00:38:53.294 --> 00:38:57.797]  I read some French and Portuguese naval histories going back 500, 600 years, too.
[00:38:57.797 --> 00:39:01.701]  And these were just letters translated into these volumes of books, and it was describing
[00:39:02.341 --> 00:39:20.336]  And I mean, you talk about captain's logs of like, there's this British ship, and they come up on ten pirate ships, and there's the chief, and he's like five feet tall, and he's Asian, and he's got all these giant Africans he's bred with other Asians that are just humongous Samoans as big as The Rock.
[00:39:20.336 --> 00:39:25.241]  And they get in this giant fight, and the descriptions of it are just unbelievable.
[00:39:25.241 --> 00:39:27.903]  Like, they'll run swords all the way through them, and the guys will keep fighting.
[00:39:29.252 --> 00:39:35.598]  It's like, uh, ordered to go into these waters filled with, with Arabic slave traders.
[00:39:35.598 --> 00:39:40.983]  We're sure to run into, to, uh, you know, their African slave soldiers racing for the attack.
[00:39:40.983 --> 00:39:45.608]  And then it's just like, I mean, just like all these black slaves attacking.
[00:39:45.608 --> 00:39:48.811]  I mean, it's just like white people are the only people ever did this.
[00:39:48.811 --> 00:39:50.913]  Are you joking me?
[00:39:50.913 --> 00:39:52.915]  Ilhan Omar is a slave master.
[00:39:52.915 --> 00:39:53.576]  She loves it.
[00:39:57.043 --> 00:40:00.005]  America and the world should have never been closed.
[00:40:00.005 --> 00:40:06.528]  It was all based on WHO, Bill and Melinda Gates, Fauci, NIH lies.
[00:40:06.528 --> 00:40:16.693]  But now, here we are, already into August, and they're trying to keep our stores, our factories, our schools, our parks closed.
[00:40:16.693 --> 00:40:18.254]  It is outrageous.

[00:41:18.219 --> 00:41:19.680]  It doesn't have all the fillers.
[00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:21.282]  It is amazing.
[00:41:21.282 --> 00:41:23.383]  Folks have loved the other toothpaste that he's developed.
[00:41:23.383 --> 00:41:26.506]  If you like those, you're really going to love this.

[00:42:10.234 --> 00:42:16.840]  Where did it come from?

[00:42:58.112 --> 00:43:00.173]  August 2020 is here.
[00:43:00.173 --> 00:43:03.574]  It's less than 90 days out from the historic election.
[00:43:03.574 --> 00:43:19.180]  The CHICOMS, the EU, Hollywood, the Democratic Party, and the blue states and blue cities are all battling to keep America shut down and to destroy free speech as well to ensure their final takeover of the United States by removing President Donald John Trump.
[00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:21.341]  At InfoWars, we're fighting back harder than ever.
[00:43:21.621 --> 00:43:25.163]  So your word of mouth and your prayer is key for the transmission.

[00:43:36.051 --> 00:43:41.995]  50-60% off all of our top sellers and double patriot points at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:43:41.995 --> 00:43:45.598]  Get your Chill Force, Winter Sun Plus, DNA Force Plus, Ultra 12,
[00:43:46.318 --> 00:43:48.500]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:20.641]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:44:20.641 --> 00:44:24.422]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:44:24.422 --> 00:44:44.528]  It's estimated by mainline historians that over a million Spanish were kidnapped over a 500 year period out of Spain, which was a Germanic stock area.
[00:44:44.528 --> 00:44:45.348]  It was three kingdoms.
[00:44:46.678 --> 00:45:00.309]  And taken to North Africa, trans-shipped across land to Somalia, and sold in the Pacific to the different Pacific Islanders who had a slave culture.
[00:45:00.309 --> 00:45:10.077]  That's why you go to the Pacific Islands, you'll have the royalty that are these little guys that run everything that are Asian, and then you've got all the warrior class that are bred with Asians and blacks.
[00:45:10.911 --> 00:45:19.958]  And I mean, this is the world, folks, and the public is so ignorant about what Samoans are, or any of this.
[00:45:19.958 --> 00:45:25.662]  And so, that was just warfare.
[00:45:25.662 --> 00:45:34.649]  And by the way, you called it slavery, not defending the institution, but I mean, you know, the warrior class was owned by the king, but they were proud of themselves and taken care of, just like the Hessians.
[00:45:36.112 --> 00:45:41.795]  In Prussia, that didn't, serfdom didn't get abolished until the 1880s in Prussia.
[00:45:41.795 --> 00:45:50.239]  And the Hessian soldiers wore big blue uniforms and black fancy Hessian boots, and they were owned by the King of Prussia.
[00:45:50.239 --> 00:46:01.264]  And a bunch of them got brought over here to fight us during the war for independence, but they got here and saw the freedom, and saw all the communities, and for the first time ever, half of them ran off.
[00:46:01.264 --> 00:46:02.044]  Half of them ran off.
[00:46:03.473 --> 00:46:05.476]  And that's why the U.S.
[00:46:05.476 --> 00:46:07.279]  was not a big German population.
[00:46:07.279 --> 00:46:10.565]  It was mainly Dutch and British and Scottish and Irish.
[00:46:11.494 --> 00:46:18.237]  Until, from the colonies, until the Germans came over here and ran off by the hundreds of thousands.
[00:46:18.237 --> 00:46:21.098]  They kept bringing them over, and they would just instantly run off.
[00:46:21.098 --> 00:46:25.240]  Which had never happened before, because they'd always been in a caste system in Europe.
[00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:27.982]  Where you've got the royalty, and then you do what you're told, and you do this.
[00:46:27.982 --> 00:46:32.204]  They got here, and people were like, the women, the men, everybody was like, hey, be with us!
[00:46:32.204 --> 00:46:32.864]  Come on!
[00:46:32.864 --> 00:46:34.004]  Come on right now!
[00:46:34.004 --> 00:46:34.945]  They were like, yeah, I'm done!
[00:46:36.724 --> 00:46:38.165]  Again, this is the reality.
[00:46:38.165 --> 00:46:45.128]  Do German-Americans who go back to the Hessians that came over here, do they have chips on their shoulders that, oh, they were slaves in Germany or whatever?
[00:46:45.128 --> 00:46:47.849]  Or the Russians were serfs on the land?
[00:46:47.849 --> 00:46:49.070]  You were owned, you were on the land?
[00:46:49.070 --> 00:46:50.250]  No.
[00:46:50.250 --> 00:46:55.613]  Not a chip on the shoulder, but they teach you because you have slavery in your background, you're a bad person.
[00:46:55.613 --> 00:46:57.073]  What the hell does that even mean?
[00:46:57.073 --> 00:47:00.155]  Everyone in every culture had slavery.
[00:47:00.155 --> 00:47:00.615]  Every place.
[00:47:01.681 --> 00:47:03.883]  Oh, you're trying to lessen the problems of it.
[00:47:03.883 --> 00:47:04.903]  No, I'm not!
[00:47:04.903 --> 00:47:16.511]  The globalists have slave camps in China today with people working harder than slaves ever worked, up to 18 hours a day, forced abortions, living in containers, being forced drugged.
[00:47:16.511 --> 00:47:22.235]  China is more evil than anything anyone's ever thought of on a mass scale.
[00:47:22.235 --> 00:47:23.196]  To their own people!
[00:47:27.293 --> 00:47:34.395]  And Nike and Apple are at the bloody trough lecturing us, an open free society, about how we suck?
[00:47:39.591 --> 00:47:40.752]  It's an obscene joke.
[00:47:40.752 --> 00:47:43.953]  It's the Democrats in a lip lock with the CHICOMS.
[00:47:43.953 --> 00:47:46.655]  It's the Democrats literally selling us out of the CHICOMS.
[00:47:46.655 --> 00:47:50.617]  And then of course they're telling us we're all racist and we all need to kill each other and we need to have race riots.
[00:47:50.617 --> 00:47:54.679]  Because they've been caught selling us out to China and they're panicking.
[00:47:54.679 --> 00:47:56.660]  They were flooding us with fentanyl.
[00:47:56.660 --> 00:48:02.563]  They were flooding us with all the poisonous Chinese drugs that have been found to be tainted.
[00:48:02.563 --> 00:48:04.284]  They got caught and you wonder why.
[00:48:05.889 --> 00:48:17.978]  Biden and all of them look like demonic crones because that's the type of garbage, that's the type of filth that would sell their own country out.
[00:48:17.978 --> 00:48:26.525]  And you sit there and you watch a bunch of basketball players taken care of better than any king ever was with tens of millions of dollars in their bank accounts.
[00:48:27.526 --> 00:48:40.093]  And with everything, and they take a knee, but they won't say a damn word about China, because if one manager says, yeah, China ought to let us have free speech, that manager gets in trouble.
[00:48:40.093 --> 00:48:51.339]  But then these people come out there, and they kneel, they're in the anthem, and talk smack about it, because we're all supposed to hate our country, and it's literally the Chinese government funding it, and all these people are schmucks.
[00:48:51.339 --> 00:48:54.681]  But it's not the basketball players who are the problem.
[00:48:54.681 --> 00:48:56.702]  It's the cowardly scumbag,
[00:48:58.402 --> 00:49:03.785]  Owners of those teams who all just go along with the globalist agenda.
[00:49:03.785 --> 00:49:14.752]  I'm going to go to break, come back, and I'm going to go to Craig, Jim, Brandon, Mike, Nicholas, Wild, Joe, Carlos, John, David, many others on this Wednesday edition.
[00:49:14.752 --> 00:49:20.616]  But since I mentioned this earlier, let me hit this right now.
[00:49:20.616 --> 00:49:23.358]  I talked about by hydrogen monoxide.
[00:49:28.336 --> 00:49:38.438]  Now, since 1983, they've had April Fool's Day edition of major publications come out and say we should ban hydrogen monoxide.
[00:49:38.438 --> 00:49:51.262]  The majority of people agree because it sounds scary like other dangerous toxic things like carbon monoxide that'll kill you.
[00:49:51.262 --> 00:49:52.362]  That's how they've now listed
[00:49:56.454 --> 00:50:05.057]  Other things that are just like water needed for life on this earth as evil is because the public is so fabulously ignorant.
[00:50:05.057 --> 00:50:09.298]  Carbon dioxide is one of the four building blocks of life.
[00:50:09.298 --> 00:50:12.299]  Sunlight, water, oxygen, carbon dioxide.
[00:50:12.299 --> 00:50:14.400]  Carbon monoxide is totally different.
[00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:22.523]  But they have officially listed carbon dioxide that plants live off of as evil.
[00:50:22.523 --> 00:50:24.503]  That way they can say all carbon is bad.
[00:50:24.503 --> 00:50:25.584]  And Bill Gates and others say
[00:50:26.513 --> 00:50:30.818]  We are going to lower the level of it down to zero.
[00:50:30.818 --> 00:50:33.080]  Well, the whole planet would be dead if they did that.
[00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:37.745]  And that's how alien and sick and crazy this is.
[00:50:37.745 --> 00:50:38.866]  So here it is.
[00:50:38.866 --> 00:50:45.052]  Our hydrogen monoxide is the water molecule.
[00:50:45.052 --> 00:50:47.895]  Oxygen, hydrogen, and hydrogen.
[00:50:47.895 --> 00:50:49.057]  But the majority of people
[00:50:50.274 --> 00:50:50.934]  I think?
[00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:20.660]  It's just crazy.
[00:51:20.660 --> 00:51:21.341]  Here's another one.
[00:51:21.341 --> 00:51:22.742]  What is the scientific name of water?
[00:51:22.742 --> 00:51:25.363]  Dihydrogen monoxide.
[00:51:25.363 --> 00:51:29.185]  But I guarantee you, you talk to your friends and family, you go, we need to ban dihydrogen monoxide for the earth.
[00:51:29.185 --> 00:51:32.287]  They'll say, yep, I'm a virtuous ignorant, let's do it.
[00:51:32.287 --> 00:51:36.930]  You also tell people, man, sodium chloride is really causing a problem.
[00:51:36.930 --> 00:51:39.191]  We need to do something about it.
[00:51:39.191 --> 00:51:44.635]  That's table salt.
[00:51:44.635 --> 00:51:47.877]  Now you laugh at that, but that's not funny.
[00:51:47.877 --> 00:51:48.237]  Because...
[00:51:57.415 --> 00:52:02.499]  They're banning carbon dioxide, folks, just like they can tell you that dihydrogen monoxide is bad.
[00:52:02.499 --> 00:52:06.062]  So, that's the real deficit we have here with reality.
[00:52:06.062 --> 00:52:08.044]  Okay, let me just say this and we'll go to break and come back.
[00:52:08.044 --> 00:52:10.026]  I've got a lot more.
[00:52:10.026 --> 00:52:19.093]  I've got some huge news on the explosion and what Trump had to say and we'll cover that at 6 after and then we'll go rise your calls.
[00:52:19.093 --> 00:52:19.834]  Major power
[00:52:21.701 --> 00:52:25.371]  Came out and said that they believe the Iranians are running that facility.
[00:52:25.371 --> 00:52:28.359]  That major power has a history of blowing up weapons depots in the Middle East.
[00:52:29.417 --> 00:52:30.999]  Looks like what Trump said is right again.
[00:52:30.999 --> 00:52:32.820]  That is coming up next hour.
[00:52:32.820 --> 00:52:36.624]  But first off, we fund this operation because you buy products from us.
[00:52:36.624 --> 00:52:40.288]  And we've got the best air filtration, four-stage ion filter.
[00:52:40.288 --> 00:52:46.334]  That's $200, $300 less than the exact same filter from other companies, who just put a three times, four times markup on it.
[00:52:46.334 --> 00:52:48.896]  They are selling those at cost, but only for another week.
[00:52:48.896 --> 00:52:51.459]  Luxapir Breeze available for just $149.
[00:52:51.459 --> 00:52:53.000]  It's unbelievable to get at that cost.
[00:52:54.072 --> 00:53:02.179]  Also, we don't have store-to-ride free shipping anymore, because we're bringing in a bunch of money, but none of it is there to actually fund the operation.
[00:53:02.179 --> 00:53:08.764]  Of course, we're selling a lot of products at those prices, but there's no money to actually fund things, so there's no real extra cash there.
[00:53:08.764 --> 00:53:13.288]  So, you can still get 50 to 60 percent off of the best-selling products.
[00:53:13.288 --> 00:53:15.570]  Double Patriot points for your next order.
[00:53:15.570 --> 00:53:17.732]  And these specials will have to end very, very soon.
[00:53:17.732 --> 00:53:21.375]  It's the Reopen America Back-to-School Special.
[00:53:23.350 --> 00:53:33.279]  50% off, 50% off all our best sellers, double Patriot points, bodies, Living Defense, Vasil Beach, Faribault Forest, Vitamineral Fusion, RainForce Plus, and those are all selling out, so I've got to stop that soon.
[00:53:33.279 --> 00:53:40.465]  Survival Shield X2, Survival Shield X3, Lung Cleanse, Ultra 12, DNA Force Plus, these are all just game changers, folks.
[00:53:40.845 --> 00:53:47.209]  Winter sun plus, so that's so good for your immunity with the purest, best vitamin D3 and vitamin K for better absorption, take it out of the tongue.
[00:53:47.209 --> 00:53:47.810]  Chill force, 50% off.
[00:53:47.810 --> 00:53:49.631]  Superfemale vitality, 50% off.
[00:53:49.631 --> 00:53:51.232]  Biodiversity, 50% off.
[00:53:51.232 --> 00:53:52.132]  Extendo-life, 50% off.
[00:53:52.132 --> 00:53:55.354]  And depending on your physiology and your metabolic system and what you might be...
[00:53:56.355 --> 00:53:56.736]  I don't
[00:54:15.435 --> 00:54:19.920]  You need to be careful when you take it because it'll give you so much energy, at least it does me, that it's just insane.
[00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:21.141]  Same thing with X2 or X3.
[00:54:21.141 --> 00:54:27.248]  Just so many of us are deficient in that key compound, that essential compound, that essential element, iodine.
[00:54:27.248 --> 00:54:30.432]  When you finally get it at the atomic level, it's such a game changer.
[00:54:30.432 --> 00:54:31.132]  It can be a little crazy.
[00:54:32.013 --> 00:54:41.485]  But just take advantage of all that in full war store calm while you still can and again I would just say with all the crazies going on I gets horrible food They're shipping within two to four weeks now.
[00:54:41.485 --> 00:54:42.146]  They have it in stock.
[00:54:42.146 --> 00:54:44.008]  It's the highest quality in full war store.
[00:54:44.008 --> 00:54:47.432]  Calm the right back stay with us another part of the greater
[00:54:49.986 --> 00:54:50.327]  I don't
[00:55:04.906 --> 00:55:05.246]  We're good to go.
[00:55:22.546 --> 00:55:25.329]  That's why when I ask listeners and viewers for your prayer, I mean it.
[00:55:25.329 --> 00:55:26.410]  I'm praying for America.
[00:55:26.410 --> 00:55:27.271]  I'm praying for you.
[00:55:27.271 --> 00:55:30.434]  And I know the power of prayer is real and God hears it.
[00:55:30.434 --> 00:55:33.437]  We need to come together and pray for an even greater awakening.
[00:55:33.437 --> 00:55:35.839]  Pray for Donald Trump to be protected.
[00:55:35.839 --> 00:55:43.387]  Pray for him to win in a landslide and pray for the people under deception of the globalists to awaken and join us in liberty and freedom.
[00:55:43.387 --> 00:55:44.067]  God bless you all.
[00:55:44.067 --> 00:55:45.269]  Please pray for him for us as well.
[00:55:47.503 --> 00:55:58.309]  Americans have had freedom for so long, and most Americans were born into such docile times compared to the rest of history, that we really have a blind spot for tyranny.
[00:55:58.309 --> 00:56:07.535]  We don't appreciate the American way, truth, justice, due process, the right to self-defense, private property, because we've had it so long, and we just think that's how the rest of the world is.
[00:56:07.895 --> 00:56:22.045]  Ladies and gentlemen, the renaissance, the social contract that's 500 years old to try to build up humanity and try to believe in humanity and try to empower the weak as well as the strong is something the West invented and that's what made our modern world.
[00:56:22.045 --> 00:56:36.276]  That's now been hijacked by the technocrats, by the globalists who say humans are ugly and bad for the earth and we need to be culled and dumbed down and put into subgroups that the elites dominate, manipulate and command if we're even lucky enough to stay alive.
[00:56:36.716 --> 00:56:38.397]  And that's what COVID-19 is.
[00:56:38.397 --> 00:56:45.101]  A global UN revolution against free humanity, against your family, against prosperity, and against your future.
[00:56:45.101 --> 00:56:51.045]  If you don't stand up and fight, you deserve what you get.
[00:56:51.045 --> 00:56:53.647]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:56:59.977 --> 00:57:07.720]  Coming up, your phone calls and Benjamin Netanyahu talking about the explosion, talking about that facility.
[00:57:07.720 --> 00:57:10.422]  Sometimes the news clips just speak for themselves.
[00:57:10.422 --> 00:57:11.102]  Here's Biden.
[00:57:13.826 --> 00:57:19.988]  President, your opponent in this election, President Trump, has made your mental state a campaign topic.
[00:57:19.988 --> 00:57:31.693]  And when asked in June if you've been tested for cognitive decline, you've responded that you're constantly tested, in effect, because you're in situations like this on the campaign trail.
[00:57:31.693 --> 00:57:36.235]  But please clarify, specifically, have you taken a cognitive test?
[00:57:36.235 --> 00:57:37.955]  No, I haven't taken a test.
[00:57:37.955 --> 00:57:40.937]  Why the hell would I take a test?
[00:57:40.937 --> 00:57:41.637]  Come on, man!
[00:57:42.327 --> 00:57:46.909]  That's like saying you, before you got in this program, you take a test where you're taking cocaine or not.
[00:57:46.909 --> 00:57:48.809]  What do you think, huh?
[00:57:48.809 --> 00:57:49.269]  Are you a junkie?
[00:57:49.269 --> 00:57:59.053]  What do you say to President Trump who brags about his test and makes your mental state an issue for voters?
[00:57:59.053 --> 00:57:59.313]  Well...
[00:58:00.234 --> 00:58:05.436]  If he can't figure out the difference between an elephant and a lion, I don't know what the hell he's talking about.
[00:58:05.436 --> 00:58:06.256]  Did you watch that?
[00:58:06.256 --> 00:58:07.756]  Look, come on, man.
[00:58:07.756 --> 00:58:18.300]  I know you're trying to goad me, but I mean, I'm so forward-looking to have an opportunity to sit with the president or stand with the president in debates.
[00:58:18.300 --> 00:58:19.900]  There's gonna be plenty of time.
[00:58:19.900 --> 00:58:22.521]  And by the way, as I joke with him, you know,
[00:58:24.080 --> 00:58:24.740]  I shouldn't say it.
[00:58:24.740 --> 00:58:27.441]  I'm going to say something I probably shouldn't say.
[00:58:27.441 --> 00:58:43.125]  Anyway, I am very willing to let the American public judge my physical as well as my mental fitness and to make a judgment about who I am.
[00:58:43.125 --> 00:58:45.766]  The entertainment value of watching these people crash and burn is delicious.
[00:58:45.766 --> 00:58:49.027]  Get off of my porch.
[00:58:49.027 --> 00:58:50.067]  Can you tell Jackie...
[00:58:51.018 --> 00:58:53.179]  Developing today, the husband of L.A.
[00:58:53.179 --> 00:58:53.819]  County D.A.
[00:58:53.819 --> 00:58:58.341]  Jackie Lacy is facing charges following this March 2nd incident.
[00:58:58.341 --> 00:59:04.484]  Black Lives Matters protesters knocked on the door and David Lacy answered it while waving the gun.
[00:59:04.484 --> 00:59:09.527]  California Attorney General's office is in charge of the case due to the conflict of interest.
[00:59:09.527 --> 00:59:12.528]  He's been charged with three counts of assault with a firearm.
[00:59:12.528 --> 00:59:18.611]  Jackie Lacy later apologized saying that her husband was acting out of fear after she had received death threats.
[00:59:19.400 --> 00:59:22.822]  When people first started talking about diversity, I was a little apprehensive.
[00:59:22.822 --> 00:59:28.204]  But when I realized it just meant hiring a bunch of different colors of people who agree with me, I was all in.
[00:59:28.204 --> 00:59:29.665]  Every job should be 50% women.
[00:59:29.665 --> 00:59:33.786]  Well, I don't know if every job... Do you have a problem with diversity, Osama?
[00:59:33.786 --> 00:59:36.988]  No, I'm just saying that... Anyone else here have a problem with diversity?
[00:59:36.988 --> 00:59:39.769]  There's no biological difference between men and women.
[00:59:39.969 --> 00:59:41.510]  Very diverse guys, great work.
[00:59:41.510 --> 00:59:48.016]  I pledge to fill every position other than mine with the most diverse staff of people who agree with me in the history of Silicon Valley.
[00:59:48.016 --> 00:59:50.358]  Big tech needs to censor speech more.
[00:59:50.358 --> 00:59:52.139]  Alright, let's tweet another picture of the staff.
[00:59:52.139 --> 00:59:53.561]  Actually, let me get in the middle of this puppy.
[00:59:53.561 --> 00:59:55.162]  Camera 3, say I'm with her.
[00:59:55.162 --> 01:00:01.367]  We have black guys that hate Trump, brown guys that hate Trump, Asians that hate Trump, women that hate Trump, LGBT who hate Trump.
[01:00:01.367 --> 01:00:06.171]  Our main export at Diversity Corp is the right opinions, but said by a black guy.
[01:00:06.171 --> 01:00:07.272]  Russia gate.
[01:00:07.272 --> 01:00:08.153]  Yeah, just do the other one too.
[01:00:09.289 --> 01:00:11.731]  Scientists should never be questioned.
[01:00:11.731 --> 01:00:13.052]  He didn't even ask for my resume.
[01:00:13.052 --> 01:00:14.993]  He asked for my 23andMe and my thoughts on Trump.
[01:00:14.993 --> 01:00:18.236]  My interview was just him asking me if I had ever had sex with a woman.
[01:00:18.236 --> 01:00:20.097]  Hey, what does the plus stand for in LGBT?
[01:00:20.097 --> 01:00:22.099]  You think we get like a plus that hates Trump?
[01:00:22.099 --> 01:00:24.461]  I was like, yeah, I made out with a chick once in college.
[01:00:24.461 --> 01:00:26.703]  And then he said, okay, that's good enough.
[01:00:26.703 --> 01:00:30.546]  Okay, Twitter just hired four new shit coders, and I'm thinking we need to up the heat with a new slogan.
[01:00:30.546 --> 01:00:31.346]  Any ideas?
[01:00:31.346 --> 01:00:34.949]  Uh, what about, we don't make anything, but we are multicultural doing it.
[01:00:35.029 --> 01:00:37.634]  A code that wasn't written by the white devil.
[01:00:37.634 --> 01:00:39.417]  Uh, Lesbo, you have any ideas?
[01:00:39.417 --> 01:00:41.320]  No, I wouldn't really classify myself as gay.
[01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:43.444]  We take pride in our work.
[01:00:44.485 --> 01:00:45.966]  Hey, can we get a Colombian coder?
[01:00:45.966 --> 01:00:53.171]  You know, I make it look easy, but it takes a lot of effort to put together a broad group of people with the exact same stance on every social and political issue.
[01:00:53.171 --> 01:00:55.173]  Beauty is a social construct.
[01:00:55.173 --> 01:00:57.174]  Not sure what we do here, to be honest.
[01:00:57.174 --> 01:00:59.636]  Mainly brag about diversity on social media.
[01:00:59.636 --> 01:01:01.417]  What I like about you two is how different you are.
[01:01:01.417 --> 01:01:03.139]  We're actually pretty similar, man.
[01:01:03.139 --> 01:01:07.062]  Every morning he gives us a list of what he calls the right opinions.
[01:01:07.062 --> 01:01:10.044]  Revealing that neutrality will end the world.
[01:01:10.044 --> 01:01:11.945]  I'm pretty sure they did repeal that.
[01:01:11.945 --> 01:01:12.946]  Diversity is our strength.
[01:01:17.352 --> 01:01:18.833]  Larry, have a seat please.
[01:01:18.833 --> 01:01:22.134]  What's this I hear about you liking an Andrew Dice Clay tweet?
[01:01:22.134 --> 01:01:23.535]  Yes, my favorite comedian.
[01:01:23.535 --> 01:01:25.316]  You're fired.
[01:01:25.316 --> 01:01:28.717]  On Lebanon, you called this an attack.
[01:01:28.717 --> 01:01:32.279]  Are you confident that this was an attack and not an accident?
[01:01:32.279 --> 01:01:34.640]  Well, it seemed like it based on the explosion.
[01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:38.922]  I've met with some of our great generals and they just seemed to feel that it was.
[01:01:38.922 --> 01:01:43.704]  This was not some kind of a manufacturing
[01:01:44.970 --> 01:01:51.033]  A lot of you are probably already very familiar with these terms I'm about to introduce, but some folks aren't.
[01:01:51.033 --> 01:01:52.874]  So, for those that aren't, here they are.
[01:01:52.874 --> 01:01:54.235]  Activated charcoal.
[01:01:54.235 --> 01:01:56.236]  And then another term, enamel safe.
[01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:16.603]  Activated charcoal is the fastest growing type of toothpaste for a good reason.
[01:02:16.603 --> 01:02:17.584]  It really, really works.
[01:02:17.584 --> 01:02:32.311]  Well, we've come up with the best activated charcoal toothpaste with no fillers, the cleanest type, the highest quality, with a bunch of high quality essential oils and other ingredients known and documented to do amazing things for your oral hygiene and your overall health and your mouth.
[01:02:32.311 --> 01:02:37.114]  It's so critical and it makes your teeth look really white and really, really clean and it's good for your gums.
[01:02:37.734 --> 01:02:42.337]  But on top of that, it doesn't have any ingredients that are known to hurt enamel.
[01:02:42.337 --> 01:02:47.580]  I've gone out before and gotten toothpaste that really made my teeth clean, but eroded enamel up the top.
[01:02:47.580 --> 01:02:52.523]  So I got into really safe, healthy types of toothpaste, and that's what this is.
[01:02:52.523 --> 01:02:54.645]  It's available at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:03:20.518 --> 01:03:23.060]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, into hour number two.
[01:03:23.060 --> 01:03:27.463]  We're going to go to every caller that is on the board.
[01:03:27.463 --> 01:03:32.686]  David and John and Carlos and Joe and Wild and Nicholas and Mike and Brandon and Jim and Craig.
[01:03:32.686 --> 01:03:34.908]  I am Alex Jones, your host.
[01:03:34.908 --> 01:03:39.471]  And while the news is insane, we'll be covering a lot of it, but I'm going to go to your phone calls here in just a second.
[01:03:39.471 --> 01:03:42.452]  But this is not broken in the news yet.
[01:03:42.452 --> 01:03:48.877]  I've asked some of the intrepid writers at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com to put this out.
[01:03:50.029 --> 01:04:09.622]  Turns out in 2018, the ongoing Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, talked about Iran and Hezbollah building missiles at a factory in Beirut and supplying Hezbollah with the missiles hitting Israel.
[01:04:09.622 --> 01:04:18.008]  And they went on to say that they were going to destroy the ambitious project, warning the enemies to be careful.
[01:04:20.489 --> 01:04:22.429]  Now, that's ABC News.
[01:04:22.429 --> 01:04:31.691]  We've got the media making fun of Trump for saying he talked to the generals and they said it looks like somebody targeted and blew it up.
[01:04:31.691 --> 01:04:35.252]  Well, they have the satellites, folks, and guaranteed that was being looked at at the time.
[01:04:35.252 --> 01:04:41.493]  And so they can see the signature and I'm sure had intel.
[01:04:41.493 --> 01:04:45.774]  And so Trump knows that they're going to say, oh, Trump's full of it, let it all come out, that Israel probably blew it up.
[01:04:45.774 --> 01:04:49.495]  There were a bunch of explosions a few weeks ago in Iran at weapons facilities.
[01:04:50.353 --> 01:04:56.897]  Remember, Netanyahu also showed it at the UN and talked about it.
[01:04:56.897 --> 01:05:02.041]  Now when Trump says, looks like somebody blew this up, the generals tell me, he didn't just say that unless they told him that.
[01:05:02.041 --> 01:05:08.905]  But let's go ahead and hear from Benjamin Netanyahu two years ago.
[01:05:08.905 --> 01:05:13.128]  Hezbollah, listen to this.
[01:05:13.128 --> 01:05:18.312]  Hezbollah is deliberately using the innocent people of Beirut
[01:05:19.508 --> 01:05:36.517]  As human shields, they've placed three of these missile conversion sites along Beirut's International Airport.
[01:05:36.517 --> 01:05:42.561]  Here's a picture that's worth a thousand missiles.
[01:05:42.561 --> 01:05:46.923]  Here's Beirut's International Airport.
[01:05:46.923 --> 01:05:48.264]  Here's the first missile site.
[01:05:49.508 --> 01:05:57.670]  It's in the Uzay neighborhood, on the water's edge, a few blocks away from the runway.
[01:05:57.670 --> 01:05:59.811]  Here's the second site.
[01:05:59.811 --> 01:06:01.551]  It's underneath a soccer stadium.
[01:06:01.551 --> 01:06:03.932]  That's the soccer stadium.
[01:06:03.932 --> 01:06:06.713]  Two blocks away.
[01:06:06.713 --> 01:06:09.674]  And here's the third site.
[01:06:09.674 --> 01:06:17.596]  It's adjacent to the airport itself, right next to it.
[01:06:17.596 --> 01:06:18.176]  Okay, so...
[01:06:22.665 --> 01:06:26.555]  I would look at Israel as being who's behind this.
[01:06:26.555 --> 01:06:28.359]  And of course, no one is saying that.
[01:06:28.359 --> 01:06:29.562]  No one is talking about that.
[01:06:30.418 --> 01:06:32.299]  Because Israel is so politicized.
[01:06:32.299 --> 01:06:48.445]  Whether you're for Israel or against Israel or neutral on Israel, Israel has a long history of blowing up nuclear reactors, weapon sites, conventional bomb sites in the Middle East, whether it be in Iran, whether it be in Iraq, whether it be in Lebanon, whether it be in Syria, whether it be in Egypt.
[01:06:48.445 --> 01:06:58.029]  And so I think it's fair to say, yeah, let's roll that again when it first explodes, that huge shockwave, that Israel probably detonated a missile or had somebody put a bomb in there.
[01:06:58.029 --> 01:06:59.570]  And you see the first explosion go off.
[01:07:00.984 --> 01:07:02.245]  It looks like a nuclear explosion.
[01:07:02.245 --> 01:07:10.491]  And then once it causes a chain reaction with all of the explosives inside that facility, you can see it setting off.
[01:07:10.491 --> 01:07:12.833]  Whenever it hits, it hits some smaller munitions at first.
[01:07:12.833 --> 01:07:14.054]  They start popping off.
[01:07:14.054 --> 01:07:15.595]  And then, BABOOM!
[01:07:15.595 --> 01:07:16.575]  Chain reaction, baby.
[01:07:16.575 --> 01:07:23.400]  It hit the actual plastic explosives locker where they're taking the raw explosive and putting it into the missiles.
[01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:25.682]  And it's...major.
[01:07:29.326 --> 01:07:40.169]  And they said that was what, a thousand times bigger than the West Texas, wasn't in West Texas, the name of it was West Fertilizer Company up by Waco, north of Waco.
[01:07:40.169 --> 01:07:44.250]  And that thing killed a whole bunch of people and devastated things for miles around.
[01:07:44.250 --> 01:07:51.412]  Imagine 1,000 times more powerful.
[01:07:51.412 --> 01:07:56.534]  So, headline, Israel's fingerprints all over Beirut explosion.
[01:07:58.567 --> 01:08:05.631]  Or Benjamin Netanyahu threatened to bomb Beirut missile site in 2018.
[01:08:05.631 --> 01:08:14.295]  As he goes on, I remember Aaron, that speech that the UN gave, and he said, it's in the news, he said, I'm warning you, you better stop.
[01:08:14.295 --> 01:08:19.838]  Well, two years later, it's been hit, and it's not even in the media that he did that.
[01:08:19.838 --> 01:08:26.041]  Listeners sent us emails, Rob Dugas sent us emails all day long, and the listener pointed that out, so I'm glad we got a tip.
[01:08:27.005 --> 01:08:28.766]  Keep sending those to ShowTipsInfoWars.com.
[01:08:28.766 --> 01:08:29.306]  There you go.
[01:08:29.306 --> 01:08:30.827]  Okay, I'm done for now.
[01:08:30.827 --> 01:08:37.111]  It just went viral.
[01:08:37.111 --> 01:08:37.772]  Let's go ahead.
[01:08:37.772 --> 01:08:43.976]  That article is going up on InfoWars.com very, very soon.
[01:08:43.976 --> 01:08:46.317]  That Yahoo threatened to target weapons site in 2018.
[01:08:52.389 --> 01:08:54.449]  I guess the article is out now.
[01:08:54.449 --> 01:08:56.710]  That's not the headline I gave, but whatever, I give up.
[01:08:56.710 --> 01:08:59.850]  Netanyahu warned of Hezbollah missile site in Beirut warehouse.
[01:08:59.850 --> 01:09:05.051]  2018 footage of Israeli Prime Minister services after tragedy.
[01:09:05.051 --> 01:09:12.173]  I mean, Netanyahu threatened, you can read the articles, there's transcripts, threatened to attack it.
[01:09:12.173 --> 01:09:14.413]  But it's okay.
[01:09:14.413 --> 01:09:20.314]  You know, we have articles out, I love the crew, they're great, but it's kind of like, evident, it seems,
[01:09:23.402 --> 01:09:26.803]  It seems that they're counting flu deaths as COVID deaths.
[01:09:26.803 --> 01:09:29.964]  No, they officially admit they are six months ago.
[01:09:29.964 --> 01:09:31.625]  And it's in all the reps.
[01:09:31.625 --> 01:09:32.925]  And I see headlines.
[01:09:32.925 --> 01:09:35.526]  We always think, oh, it seems we want to be journalists.
[01:09:35.526 --> 01:09:38.107]  We always want to not be sure.
[01:09:38.107 --> 01:09:44.029]  It seems that sick people were sent into nursing homes against regulations and it killed them.
[01:09:44.029 --> 01:09:44.649]  No, no, no.
[01:09:44.649 --> 01:09:46.050]  It happened.
[01:09:46.050 --> 01:09:48.390]  It happened.
[01:09:48.390 --> 01:09:49.371]  Yeah, there it is.
[01:09:49.371 --> 01:09:49.791]  Fox News.
[01:09:51.523 --> 01:09:52.484]  It's nothing against the crew.
[01:09:52.484 --> 01:09:53.745]  I'm just to do everything on air now.
[01:09:53.745 --> 01:09:55.205]  All communication this way.
[01:09:55.205 --> 01:10:10.255]  Because... You know, I see headlines out there like, not just from us, like... Epstein claimed he founded, helped found the Clinton Foundation.
[01:10:10.255 --> 01:10:14.258]  He was on record doing it.
[01:10:14.258 --> 01:10:17.700]  You know, some claim Bill Gates was...
[01:10:19.793 --> 01:10:20.554]  Daniel Jeffrey Epstein.
[01:10:20.554 --> 01:10:23.075]  No, he's photographed, he's on record doing it.
[01:10:23.075 --> 01:10:24.657]  They're in business together.
[01:10:24.657 --> 01:10:31.522]  And so all I'm saying is, the globalists keep us in this position where we're always like, you know, there's a world government.
[01:10:31.522 --> 01:10:32.782]  Well, we say there's not.
[01:10:32.782 --> 01:10:34.684]  Dun-da-dun, do what the world government says.
[01:10:34.684 --> 01:10:38.086]  And we're always just like, arguing with them if the world government exists or not.
[01:10:38.086 --> 01:10:42.549]  Or arguing with them if convicted pedophiles are running Drag Queen Storytime, where it's all on record.
[01:10:42.549 --> 01:10:45.812]  And we never get to, hey, you're lying, we know what you're doing, you're in trouble.
[01:10:47.995 --> 01:10:50.576]  You know, the left says abolish the police department.
[01:10:50.576 --> 01:10:52.776]  How about we abolish their leftist programs?
[01:10:52.776 --> 01:10:57.318]  How about we abolish their agencies, their groups that have destroyed society?
[01:10:57.318 --> 01:11:03.179]  How about we cut off all their funding for the homeless that just pays them to be on drugs and lay around all day?
[01:11:03.179 --> 01:11:04.519]  How about we set the narrative?
[01:11:04.519 --> 01:11:10.741]  How about we go on the offensive?
[01:11:10.741 --> 01:11:15.242]  And they put in like a computer program into our servers where we can't even say the word seems.
[01:11:15.242 --> 01:11:17.303]  You know, the left's banning all these other terms.
[01:11:20.509 --> 01:11:21.589]  It doesn't seem.
[01:11:21.589 --> 01:11:22.509]  It doesn't appear.
[01:11:22.509 --> 01:11:23.950]  We're under martial law.
[01:11:23.950 --> 01:11:26.450]  They're now tightening the tourniquet around our neck.
[01:11:26.450 --> 01:11:27.831]  They're strangling us.
[01:11:27.831 --> 01:11:29.591]  The noose is going around our neck.
[01:11:29.591 --> 01:11:34.552]  And now they're announcing permanent lockdowns and checkpoints and enforceable injections and world government.
[01:11:34.552 --> 01:11:37.733]  And I sit there and I tell people this.
[01:11:37.733 --> 01:11:41.314]  Like Steven Crowder today, I'm looking at him and I'm talking to him, interviewing him.
[01:11:41.314 --> 01:11:47.715]  And he interviewed me and I go, you know, Bill Gates does have companies developing injectable microchips to make sure you're vaccinated.
[01:11:50.196 --> 01:11:52.597]  But that he knows Bill Gates has come out and said that's not true.
[01:11:52.597 --> 01:11:53.817]  Well, that's what they do.
[01:11:53.817 --> 01:11:57.098]  They go, hey, here's the companies, we're going to do it officially.
[01:11:57.098 --> 01:12:00.199]  MIT, Rice University, Google, all of it.
[01:12:00.199 --> 01:12:03.261]  But then they go, oh, Bill Gates doesn't want you to have chips under the skin.
[01:12:03.261 --> 01:12:07.522]  And then USA Today the next day goes, you're going to have a chip under your skin.
[01:12:07.522 --> 01:12:10.883]  And then we play this game where we're always like stuck in gear.
[01:12:10.883 --> 01:12:11.984]  In and out of gear.
[01:12:11.984 --> 01:12:14.304]  It's all mind control.
[01:12:14.304 --> 01:12:17.185]  It doesn't work on me.
[01:12:17.185 --> 01:12:18.986]  Other than pissing me off.
[01:12:20.782 --> 01:12:21.983]  That's why they question the tech.
[01:12:21.983 --> 01:12:23.485]  I've always noticed media matters.
[01:12:23.485 --> 01:12:25.547]  I can say the sky is blue and they'll have this whole article.
[01:12:25.547 --> 01:12:28.971]  Jones is completely discredited saying the sky is blue.
[01:12:28.971 --> 01:12:30.132]  Saying that fish live in the ocean.
[01:12:30.132 --> 01:12:31.193]  No such thing.
[01:12:31.193 --> 01:12:41.063]  Because they have to take whatever's popular and true and known, 2 plus 2 equals 4, and say it doesn't to confuse people so everyone's scared to say 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[01:12:42.592 --> 01:12:43.332]  Over.
[01:12:43.332 --> 01:12:44.372]  And over.
[01:12:44.372 --> 01:12:45.373]  And over.
[01:12:45.373 --> 01:12:46.353]  And over.
[01:12:46.353 --> 01:12:47.313]  And over.
[01:12:47.313 --> 01:12:48.273]  And over.
[01:12:48.273 --> 01:12:49.233]  And over.
[01:12:49.233 --> 01:12:50.294]  And over.
[01:12:50.294 --> 01:12:50.514]  And over.
[01:12:50.514 --> 01:12:53.954]  And if us is speaking the truth, laying it out, we're all unstable.
[01:12:53.954 --> 01:12:54.394]  Oh God!
[01:12:54.394 --> 01:12:55.015]  Oh no!
[01:12:55.015 --> 01:12:55.995]  Oh no!
[01:12:55.995 --> 01:13:01.556]  There are a lot of reasons to get an Alex Jones plastic mask at Infowarstore.com.
[01:13:01.556 --> 01:13:03.196]  You can wear them out to political events.
[01:13:03.196 --> 01:13:04.757]  You can trigger lib darts.
[01:13:04.757 --> 01:13:11.478]  But one of the biggest reasons is it's a great conversation starter at any costume party or at Halloween.
[01:13:12.025 --> 01:13:18.290]  But on top of that, they admit that wearing these masks does absolutely nothing to protect you from COVID-19 or anything else.
[01:13:18.290 --> 01:13:24.876]  It's total virtue signaling to show that you're prepared for the forced inoculations and contact tracing that they're openly announcing.
[01:13:24.876 --> 01:13:26.678]  It's an act of submission.
[01:13:26.678 --> 01:13:30.121]  It's an act of like putting a burka on your head and bowing down.
[01:13:30.121 --> 01:13:34.985]  But a big reason to wear these is then into stores when people ask you why you're wearing a Halloween mask, say,
[01:13:35.450 --> 01:13:39.853]  It's just as useless as the stupid cloth mask that you're wearing.
[01:13:39.853 --> 01:13:43.656]  And the M95 mask only controls what's coming in, not what's going out.
[01:13:43.656 --> 01:13:45.737]  So they quote, spread COVID-19.
[01:13:45.737 --> 01:13:47.238]  They don't protect from it.
[01:13:47.238 --> 01:13:50.180]  So again, it's a great way to throw it back at these control freaks' faces.
[01:13:50.180 --> 01:13:52.842]  You buy one for $9.95, you get four more free.
[01:13:52.842 --> 01:13:53.823]  They're at cost.
[01:13:53.823 --> 01:13:55.244]  Infowarestore.com.
[01:13:56.618 --> 01:14:08.167]  Vicki Gibbs, 57-year-old lesbian preacher in Houston, went in with a cough, got intubated, and then died.
[01:14:08.167 --> 01:14:13.512]  And as soon as I saw her face, as soon as I saw the report, I said, watch, it'll be intubation.
[01:14:13.512 --> 01:14:14.853]  We know what's gonna happen.
[01:14:14.853 --> 01:14:16.254]  It's a blue city.
[01:14:16.254 --> 01:14:17.475]  Same story yet again.
[01:14:17.475 --> 01:14:19.456]  And they say her heart gave out.
[01:14:20.417 --> 01:14:25.279]  If you put somebody on a breathing tube of COVID-19 as a death sentence, it's on record.
[01:14:25.279 --> 01:14:28.001]  Warn everyone you know before they go into the hospital and get killed.
[01:14:28.001 --> 01:14:31.602]  Why are almost all the deaths happening in blue cities and blue states?
[01:14:31.602 --> 01:14:38.546]  It's because they intubate them, putting a tube in their lungs, and COVID-19 is causing an autoimmune response.
[01:14:38.546 --> 01:14:42.668]  And if you do that with oxygen, the doctors are on record saying it will kill you.
[01:14:43.328 --> 01:14:47.993]  But all these doctors in blue cities and blue states follow their orders.
[01:14:47.993 --> 01:14:52.056]  And the minute I saw this report today, I knew what I would be reading.
[01:14:52.056 --> 01:14:59.384]  Don't end up like Vicki Gibbs or everyone.
[01:14:59.384 --> 01:15:02.026]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:15:15.805 --> 01:15:19.027]  My eyes are blind, but I can see.
[01:15:19.027 --> 01:15:25.411]  Haha, the sun no longer sets me free.
[01:15:25.411 --> 01:15:36.297]  Look at these deadlines.
[01:15:36.297 --> 01:15:40.820]  Europe pushing for more lockdowns despite beating back COVID-19.
[01:15:40.820 --> 01:15:43.722]  Oh, because there's record numbers, because almost all the tests are fake.
[01:15:44.892 --> 01:15:46.172]  They admit that, but it doesn't care.
[01:15:46.172 --> 01:15:50.633]  The shifting of goalposts reveals the lockdowns aren't just about the virus.
[01:15:50.633 --> 01:15:51.894]  No!
[01:15:51.894 --> 01:15:54.954]  They're about permanent control and martial law.
[01:15:54.954 --> 01:15:58.635]  NYC to impose COVID checkpoints to enforce quarantine order.
[01:15:58.635 --> 01:16:00.716]  It's all on InfoWars.com.
[01:16:00.716 --> 01:16:02.236]  Meanwhile, survey.
[01:16:02.236 --> 01:16:06.377]  Americans think coronavirus has killed 30 million people in the U.S.
[01:16:06.377 --> 01:16:07.698]  225 times higher than the actual figure.
[01:16:11.308 --> 01:16:16.031]  And I guess you just cynically decide to hate all these people and you just start feeding on them.
[01:16:16.031 --> 01:16:18.313]  I just can't do that.
[01:16:18.313 --> 01:16:24.277]  But then I've got to engage all these dumbed down idiots being led by psychotic globalist killers.
[01:16:24.277 --> 01:16:25.478]  And I don't want to say I'm depressed.
[01:16:25.478 --> 01:16:26.359]  I'm not depressed.
[01:16:26.359 --> 01:16:31.842]  I'm so pissed that I think I'm just, I'm not just saying this, I'm going to leave.
[01:16:31.842 --> 01:16:35.605]  You know, I tried to take off a few weeks earlier, but I didn't really take off.
[01:16:35.605 --> 01:16:37.566]  And it's not that I can't handle the news.
[01:16:37.566 --> 01:16:38.087]  It's just that
[01:16:39.926 --> 01:16:41.047]  Maybe I'll go out the street.
[01:16:41.047 --> 01:16:44.909]  Maybe I'll go over to the W and protest where the mayor lives.
[01:16:44.909 --> 01:16:51.314]  Maybe I'll go to Barton Springs and climb over the fence without doing a COVID-19 test and swim in the creek.
[01:16:51.314 --> 01:16:57.498]  Maybe I'll just physically go out there and not submit to these people and do reports on the street.
[01:16:58.553 --> 01:17:05.015]  I could sit here and just read the chronicle of the takeover of civilization and pure evil by psychotics that are out to get everybody.
[01:17:05.015 --> 01:17:11.916]  But really, you watch the public getting into their own enslavement and all the lazy neuroticness of people unable to get anything done.
[01:17:11.916 --> 01:17:16.137]  And it just makes me wonder, man!
[01:17:16.137 --> 01:17:19.958]  Why doesn't God just kill us all?
[01:17:19.958 --> 01:17:20.679]  See, here's the deal.
[01:17:20.679 --> 01:17:24.520]  Bill Gates plays God, so he thinks we need to be killed because we're such lazy scum.
[01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:25.720]  But he's worse than us!
[01:17:27.585 --> 01:17:34.888]  So I would respect him if he slid his own throat, blew his own head off on national television, but he doesn't do that.
[01:17:34.888 --> 01:17:45.812]  He's horrible, degenerate, filthy, lying, anti-human piece of trash, one of the worst examples of our people, and then he looks at us and hates us because he hates himself.
[01:17:45.812 --> 01:17:47.993]  I don't hate people.
[01:17:47.993 --> 01:17:55.216]  I'm just sick of all day knowing about this stuff and watching how ridiculous it gets and that
[01:17:56.243 --> 01:18:06.111]  Babbling, brain-dead, dumbass lawyer, Joe Biden stumbling around emblematically, that's what rules over us.
[01:18:06.111 --> 01:18:13.376]  With all these candy-ass butt-kissers that sit there and play along with this lunatic asylum.
[01:18:13.376 --> 01:18:15.378]  All right, listen.
[01:18:15.378 --> 01:18:16.439]  I've made you hold long enough.
[01:18:16.439 --> 01:18:17.460]  I said I was going to take calls.
[01:18:17.460 --> 01:18:18.961]  I want to hear from you.
[01:18:18.961 --> 01:18:19.541]  I thank you.
[01:18:19.541 --> 01:18:20.042]  You thank me.
[01:18:20.042 --> 01:18:21.743]  Let's dispense with the pleasantries.
[01:18:21.743 --> 01:18:22.704]  Let's just get to your point.
[01:18:24.690 --> 01:18:27.952]  And here's the thing I've been going through with this Telos phone system for years.
[01:18:27.952 --> 01:18:31.453]  So don't, today's gonna be a new day.
[01:18:31.453 --> 01:18:36.416]  When I go for a caller, when I say their name, we hit the button.
[01:18:36.416 --> 01:18:40.378]  And it goes, so they don't hear me saying their name.
[01:18:40.378 --> 01:18:42.859]  So the new thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna say their name once.
[01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:46.121]  And then I'm going to say it again, and we go to it the second time.
[01:18:46.121 --> 01:18:48.262]  And we are going to defeat this.
[01:18:48.262 --> 01:18:51.123]  Oh, if we can just defeat this, this one thing.
[01:18:51.123 --> 01:18:52.043]  I love calls.
[01:18:52.043 --> 01:18:54.084]  The part I hate is the connecting with them.
[01:18:54.084 --> 01:18:55.005]  And the, hello?
[01:18:55.005 --> 01:18:55.625]  Hello?
[01:18:55.625 --> 01:18:56.085]  Hello?
[01:18:56.085 --> 01:18:59.867]  So we're going to do this right now.
[01:18:59.867 --> 01:19:00.567]  We got Jim.
[01:19:00.567 --> 01:19:01.287]  We got Brandon.
[01:19:01.287 --> 01:19:01.887]  We got Mike.
[01:19:01.887 --> 01:19:02.528]  We got Nicholas.
[01:19:02.528 --> 01:19:03.408]  We got Wilde.
[01:19:03.408 --> 01:19:04.108]  We got Joe.
[01:19:04.108 --> 01:19:04.869]  We got Carlos.
[01:19:04.869 --> 01:19:05.549]  We got John.
[01:19:05.549 --> 01:19:06.289]  We got David.
[01:19:06.289 --> 01:19:06.949]  I love Carlos.
[01:19:06.949 --> 01:19:08.550]  He's a longtime regular caller.
[01:19:08.550 --> 01:19:10.211]  I'm going to stop bitching and be a whiny ass.
[01:19:11.104 --> 01:19:12.204]  Maybe I just won't be here for a few weeks.
[01:19:12.204 --> 01:19:13.705]  Maybe I'll just quit and leave.
[01:19:13.705 --> 01:19:16.786]  I'm serious.
[01:19:16.786 --> 01:19:19.367]  Man, I tell you, I don't want to be around it anymore!
[01:19:19.367 --> 01:19:21.048]  Carlos in Canada, you're on the air.
[01:19:21.048 --> 01:19:22.848]  Go ahead.
[01:19:22.848 --> 01:19:24.649]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:19:24.649 --> 01:19:32.212]  I watched your program on Saturday, a very special program with Dr. Pashinyak, and very important, very relevant.
[01:19:32.212 --> 01:19:40.855]  And there was an aspect of his conversation which I wanted to address with you today, and also to provide solutions, because that's what is really needed.
[01:19:42.040 --> 01:19:58.028]  I will take about 30 seconds to read something that is familiar, but which has four little words at the end, and which are very short words, but they're very important, and are addressed specifically to President Trump.
[01:19:58.028 --> 01:19:59.629]  It reads like this.
[01:19:59.629 --> 01:20:10.855]  I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:20:11.567 --> 01:20:16.271]  That I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same.
[01:20:16.271 --> 01:20:25.158]  That I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion.
[01:20:25.158 --> 01:20:35.025]  And that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter.
[01:20:35.025 --> 01:20:38.608]  So help me God.
[01:20:38.608 --> 01:20:40.750]  Two letters, four letters,
[01:20:41.601 --> 01:20:44.062]  Two letters and three letters.
[01:20:44.062 --> 01:21:08.989]  The so help me God means that if you betray the words that you have just uttered beforehand freely without any mental reservation and purpose of evasion then you sir are in the domain of the President of the United States of America and you madam sir who took office cannot deny the protection of the American people lest
[01:21:09.676 --> 01:21:17.700]  The President of the United States reminds you, so help you God.
[01:21:17.700 --> 01:21:24.424]  And so has Trump faithfully executed the office to which he swore before God?
[01:21:24.424 --> 01:21:38.131]  All the people, all the governors, people that have said that you cannot do this, they won't do this, they will not protect the American people, forcing the President to threaten to bring in the military who are not fulfilling their office.
[01:21:38.131 --> 01:21:39.192]  80 days before an election.
[01:21:39.554 --> 01:21:46.357]  We're having our whole birthright no matter what color we are.
[01:21:46.357 --> 01:21:51.579]  We're being robbed right now.
[01:21:51.579 --> 01:21:55.121]  That's why I'm pissed.
[01:21:55.121 --> 01:21:55.921]  Exactly.
[01:21:55.921 --> 01:22:01.543]  And that is why they're entering the domain of the four little words in that oath.
[01:22:01.543 --> 01:22:05.125]  There is a governor in Illinois, Governor Jay Pritzker.
[01:22:05.686 --> 01:22:08.648]  Who said, oh no, you cannot bring the military here.
[01:22:08.648 --> 01:22:09.328]  No, no, no way.
[01:22:09.328 --> 01:22:11.009]  We're not going to have that.
[01:22:11.009 --> 01:22:14.412]  Believe me, the president has every authority to do it.
[01:22:14.412 --> 01:22:22.797]  It's called the Insurrection Act, and it requires that... And by the way, what the Democrats and the globalists are doing is insurrection against the country.
[01:22:22.797 --> 01:22:24.518]  People call Joneses for martial law.
[01:22:24.518 --> 01:22:26.239]  They've already created their own martial law.
[01:22:26.239 --> 01:22:27.220]  They're ignoring the law.
[01:22:27.220 --> 01:22:28.741]  They're ignoring the Constitution.
[01:22:28.741 --> 01:22:29.922]  That's martial law.
[01:22:29.922 --> 01:22:33.084]  So the president needs to come back in and enforce the Bill of Rights right now.
[01:22:34.275 --> 01:22:35.055]  Exactly.
[01:22:35.055 --> 01:22:55.804]  So, it is because, as I think I mentioned to you before, and you know, Dr. Pyshennik failed to, I think, not failed, but he didn't mention something very important, and that is that what's happening to the United States today, we, you and I discussed this before, is being conducted by the interest of international financiers
[01:22:56.252 --> 01:23:00.554]  Who do not care what happens to destroy a country at all.
[01:23:00.554 --> 01:23:06.217]  As long as the country depends and comes back, hat in hand.
[01:23:06.217 --> 01:23:06.938]  Stay there, Carlos.
[01:23:06.938 --> 01:23:08.639]  It's not that they don't care.
[01:23:08.639 --> 01:23:10.500]  They want to destroy you and make you independent.
[01:23:10.500 --> 01:23:12.040]  They want to destroy real economies.
[01:23:12.040 --> 01:23:15.902]  This whole COVID thing is about destroying people that are self-sufficient.
[01:23:15.902 --> 01:23:17.143]  That's what this is.
[01:23:17.143 --> 01:23:20.265]  We're all learning to go under welfare right now.
[01:23:20.265 --> 01:23:20.725]  That's right.
[01:23:21.215 --> 01:23:28.609]  And if you remember, the Senate was given a very, very good warning about this by Paul Warburg, an international financier.
[01:23:34.454 --> 01:23:36.677]  About the place we're at in society and history.
[01:23:36.677 --> 01:23:39.219]  And again, folks, I apologize if I get down on air.
[01:23:39.219 --> 01:23:40.080]  The show's not an act.
[01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:41.202]  The media says it's an act.
[01:23:41.202 --> 01:23:42.363]  It's the opposite of that.
[01:23:42.363 --> 01:23:44.325]  What you see on air is what's going on, okay?
[01:23:44.325 --> 01:23:45.987]  And I'll try to tough it out.
[01:23:45.987 --> 01:23:47.929]  I get in a nasty mood and I apologize.
[01:23:47.929 --> 01:23:49.011]  It's just, I'm really pissed.
[01:23:49.011 --> 01:23:49.731]  I know you are too.
[01:23:49.731 --> 01:23:51.213]  And I'm just, I'm at my breaking point, man.
[01:23:51.213 --> 01:23:51.934]  I'm telling you.
[01:23:51.934 --> 01:23:52.555]  We'll be right back.
[01:23:52.555 --> 01:23:52.815]  Stay with us.
[01:23:54.779 --> 01:24:07.008]  States cracking down on social gatherings, says CNN, because Fauci says if we don't, we'll see further surges in coronavirus positives.
[01:24:07.008 --> 01:24:16.014]  Because they're only ramping up the testing, and because the tests have been designed at the Wuhan lab, it turns out, to be completely fraudulent.
[01:24:16.014 --> 01:24:23.240]  They cook the whole thing up, offshore, in a communist dictatorship, with Fauci, Bill Gates, and the CHICOMS,
[01:24:25.801 --> 01:24:40.949]  And now it's all over the news that indeed Bill Gates has developed digital tattoos under your skin, and so has Google, and they're deploying them at the airports next year, where you'll have to have it to be able to travel.
[01:24:40.949 --> 01:24:49.714]  Oh, and then soon to leave your house or go in a grocery store, and the contact tracers work for Bill and Melinda Gates and the Clintons, and they're going to come to your house and make sure you're inoculated.
[01:24:50.094 --> 01:24:52.736]  Yes, we're now inside the Mark of the Beast.
[01:24:52.736 --> 01:24:54.778]  Resist or be enslaved.
[01:24:54.778 --> 01:24:56.420]  It's finally here.

[01:27:16.282 --> 01:27:21.406]  Look, ladies and gentlemen, we've been trained to put up with being slaves and have our kids killed right in front of us.
[01:27:21.406 --> 01:27:24.029]  Governors brag about keeping babies alive and taking their organs.
[01:27:25.302 --> 01:27:27.724]  And the good news is we've been very blessed to have InfoWars.
[01:27:27.724 --> 01:27:30.726]  We've been very blessed to counter the globalists.
[01:27:30.726 --> 01:27:33.188]  But man, there's nothing like seeing the sheep in their mask.
[01:27:33.188 --> 01:27:36.271]  And there's nothing like... I was out at like 6 a.m.
[01:27:36.271 --> 01:27:37.692]  this morning going for a hike.
[01:27:37.692 --> 01:27:39.673]  And I was driving to where I was going to go on the Greenbelt.
[01:27:39.673 --> 01:27:43.917]  And I saw people in neighborhoods where there's no one out at 6 a.m.
[01:27:43.917 --> 01:27:44.377]  in the morning.
[01:27:44.377 --> 01:27:45.838]  And I'm drinking coffee driving.
[01:27:45.838 --> 01:27:48.020]  And there's like a guy with a mask on and his dog.
[01:27:48.020 --> 01:27:50.021]  And there's no one out for like two miles.
[01:27:50.021 --> 01:27:52.523]  And then I see another person wearing a mask in the dark.
[01:27:59.520 --> 01:28:01.240]  You can say, well, just let them wear their mask.
[01:28:01.240 --> 01:28:02.961]  No, it's all about the lie.
[01:28:02.961 --> 01:28:03.941]  It's all about the lockdown.
[01:28:03.941 --> 01:28:05.581]  It's about the contact tracing.
[01:28:05.581 --> 01:28:07.502]  It's about the digital tracking.
[01:28:07.502 --> 01:28:11.442]  It's about the forced inoculation.
[01:28:11.442 --> 01:28:15.803]  And then, you know, the Clintons run the contact tracers and get the money.
[01:28:15.803 --> 01:28:20.304]  Like, Texas gave billions of dollars to a company that part of it goes to Bill Clinton.
[01:28:20.304 --> 01:28:25.865]  My tax money, Governor Abbott gave it to a Google company that gives part of the money to Chelsea Clinton.
[01:28:25.865 --> 01:28:28.986]  I mean, it's just like, you can't get them out of your lives, man!
[01:28:31.621 --> 01:28:35.993]  So, you know, we've just gone too far.
[01:28:35.993 --> 01:28:37.998]  We've gone too far putting up with this politically.
[01:28:39.028 --> 01:28:50.951]  And I'm not saying we should offensively get violent, but my brain and my genes, my cells are saying kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill.
[01:28:50.951 --> 01:28:52.311]  I mean, they're killing us.
[01:28:52.311 --> 01:28:57.633]  Bill Gates is coming with a weapon to kill us slowly and laugh about it.
[01:28:57.633 --> 01:29:04.715]  And he's on TV laughing how it's going to make us sick and laughing how we're in a depression and it pisses me off and you need to get pissed.
[01:29:04.715 --> 01:29:05.695]  I don't care what he does to me.
[01:29:07.799 --> 01:29:09.901]  I just want him off of our back.
[01:29:09.901 --> 01:29:13.124]  I don't even want harm against Bill Gates, because he doesn't exist.
[01:29:13.124 --> 01:29:16.407]  He's a gateway to hell.
[01:29:16.407 --> 01:29:18.830]  He's a wormhole.
[01:29:18.830 --> 01:29:23.034]  He's a crack in the fabric of time that a demon is looking through.
[01:29:23.034 --> 01:29:25.336]  That's all he is.
[01:29:25.336 --> 01:29:26.257]  He's already judged.
[01:29:26.257 --> 01:29:27.318]  He's already done.
[01:29:27.318 --> 01:29:31.682]  But you need to reject him, because when you submit to him, you become him.
[01:29:33.968 --> 01:29:34.688]  And that's just it.
[01:29:34.688 --> 01:29:38.150]  I feel the people separating right now and dividing ourselves.
[01:29:38.150 --> 01:29:46.174]  And that's why I try to make it about sex or race or where you're from, because that's all they've got, because they know it's really a spiritual thing.
[01:29:46.174 --> 01:29:47.475]  We should be positive and thank God.
[01:29:47.475 --> 01:29:49.316]  We should just pray and put it on God.
[01:29:49.316 --> 01:29:50.156]  I tell myself that.
[01:29:50.156 --> 01:29:51.157]  I'm not preaching at you.
[01:29:51.157 --> 01:29:55.499]  That's why I talk about myself on air, because, I mean, the only way I know how to interface this is how I'm dealing with it.
[01:29:56.363 --> 01:29:58.364]  I know you're dealing with the same way, so I'm going to shut up.
[01:29:58.364 --> 01:30:00.165]  I said I'd go to your calls, and I apologize.
[01:30:00.165 --> 01:30:01.366]  Getting callers on and not getting everybody.
[01:30:01.366 --> 01:30:04.167]  I'm doing a little bit better job these days, but Carlos is making some great points.
[01:30:04.167 --> 01:30:07.689]  Solution, Trump has less than 12 weeks, 89 days left.
[01:30:07.689 --> 01:30:08.509]  What do you think, Carlos?
[01:30:08.509 --> 01:30:09.970]  Finish your points.
[01:30:09.970 --> 01:30:25.978]  Well, I think that the President of the United States, it's now, this is entering the phase where now you're in the, so help me God, aspect of the oath of office that a lot of governors, congressmen, senators have taken.
[01:30:26.502 --> 01:30:37.046]  You cannot allow the individual person in the street to start thinking of affecting a citizen's arrest or taking the law in his or her own hands.
[01:30:37.046 --> 01:30:38.287]  This is past the point.
[01:30:38.287 --> 01:30:48.871]  This is where the President of the United States, John F. Kennedy, invoked the Insurrection Act in 1962, President Lyndon Johnson, President George Herbert Walker Bush did as well.
[01:30:48.871 --> 01:30:53.512]  These are giant problems that if the country doesn't act as a nation, it dies.
[01:30:53.512 --> 01:30:55.013]  It's a country-level event.
[01:30:56.215 --> 01:30:58.917]  Yes, well, you know, black lives matter.
[01:30:58.917 --> 01:31:00.258]  The point has been made.
[01:31:00.258 --> 01:31:02.780]  Police brutality has been recognized.
[01:31:02.780 --> 01:31:04.261]  All the rest is poetry.
[01:31:04.261 --> 01:31:06.302]  What these people are doing is terrorism.
[01:31:06.302 --> 01:31:07.583]  The point has been made.
[01:31:07.583 --> 01:31:11.186]  How much are they going to hammer to the nail to the ground?
[01:31:11.186 --> 01:31:12.927]  I mean, come on, it's finished.
[01:31:12.927 --> 01:31:15.048]  We understand.
[01:31:15.048 --> 01:31:16.730]  Police have gotten the message.
[01:31:16.730 --> 01:31:18.491]  How far do you want to take this?
[01:31:18.491 --> 01:31:20.732]  You're taking this now all the way to Stalin?
[01:31:20.732 --> 01:31:23.054]  Come on, let's get real, OK?
[01:31:23.054 --> 01:31:25.316]  So I think it's time in the next 80 days
[01:31:26.109 --> 01:31:33.953]  Where the American people, there's a very good line, you know, in the movie The Patriot, which a lot of Americans should watch soon.
[01:31:33.953 --> 01:31:35.713]  Mel Gibson is running up the hill.
[01:31:35.713 --> 01:31:36.554]  The flag falls.
[01:31:36.554 --> 01:31:37.574]  He picks it up.
[01:31:37.574 --> 01:31:38.535]  They're over the ridge.
[01:31:38.535 --> 01:31:40.355]  The British are winning.
[01:31:40.355 --> 01:31:44.177]  And he waves his flag to let everybody know, wait a second.
[01:31:44.177 --> 01:31:45.778]  It's not over until it's over.
[01:31:45.778 --> 01:31:49.359]  There's always the last few little words.
[01:31:49.359 --> 01:31:51.380]  So help me God.
[01:31:51.380 --> 01:31:55.042]  And at that point, it turns around and victory's there.
[01:31:55.720 --> 01:31:56.261]  Why?
[01:31:56.261 --> 01:32:01.307]  Because, all of a sudden, running away from reality doesn't pay.
[01:32:01.307 --> 01:32:06.173]  There is that little virtue that defines the patriot, that defines America.
[01:32:06.818 --> 01:32:19.062]  I totally agree with you, and that's key what you said, that dropping the flag and running, people have gotten away forever with deserting responsibility and still living off what forebearers put in the gas tank.
[01:32:19.062 --> 01:32:19.962]  Now it's all gone.
[01:32:19.962 --> 01:32:21.322]  Now running makes you less safe.
[01:32:21.322 --> 01:32:27.884]  I think people now are starting to realize, that's why I'm physically, like constantly can't stop thinking about what am I going to do physically?
[01:32:27.884 --> 01:32:29.345]  And I'm not saying I'm going to do something violent.
[01:32:29.345 --> 01:32:30.585]  I'm saying my body is like,
[01:32:31.065 --> 01:32:32.606]  I need to go out and confront people.
[01:32:32.606 --> 01:32:34.708]  I need to get really aggressive, Carlos.
[01:32:34.708 --> 01:32:39.792]  I mean, my cells are, like, just, like, driving me to do something.
[01:32:39.792 --> 01:32:54.424]  Well, when you have communist agitators, these people were spoken about two years ago, three years ago, when they were invited to do what they did in Ukraine.
[01:32:54.424 --> 01:32:58.748]  You know, what surprises me is that they haven't yet started putting snipers on roofs.
[01:32:59.082 --> 01:33:02.505]  And killing people like they did in Kiev.
[01:33:02.505 --> 01:33:04.526]  But let me tell you this, okay?
[01:33:04.526 --> 01:33:06.388]  It's the message clear now.
[01:33:06.388 --> 01:33:15.074]  The President of the United States has 80 days in which he has to remind people that this is the domain of which he's the President.
[01:33:15.074 --> 01:33:17.196]  He was given the mandate.
[01:33:17.196 --> 01:33:24.001]  The hammers of hell will fall on you unless you break faith with your oath and with your country.
[01:33:24.485 --> 01:33:35.168]  This is the domain, because what I see is essentially from President Obama onward, who basically said on 90 days, we're going to get rid of this fool.
[01:33:35.168 --> 01:33:38.169]  A constitutional professor saying that?
[01:33:38.169 --> 01:33:40.209]  Please, give me a break.
[01:33:40.209 --> 01:33:43.030]  No, this is the moment of truth.
[01:33:43.030 --> 01:33:52.653]  And if President Trump is elected again, of course, I think he should be, at this stage of the game, he has to understand that, so help me God,
[01:33:53.109 --> 01:33:58.050]  Are the words that rule from his office on words.
[01:33:58.050 --> 01:33:59.030]  I agree with you, Carlos.
[01:33:59.030 --> 01:34:00.111]  Thank you so much for the call.
[01:34:00.111 --> 01:34:01.431]  I spend a lot of time with Carlos now.
[01:34:01.431 --> 01:34:02.111]  We'll get to everybody.
[01:34:02.111 --> 01:34:04.232]  877-789-ALEX.
[01:34:04.232 --> 01:34:05.112]  877-789-2539.
[01:34:05.112 --> 01:34:09.353]  Let's talk to David in California.
[01:34:09.353 --> 01:34:10.053]  Thanks for holding, David.
[01:34:10.053 --> 01:34:11.813]  I appreciate you.
[01:34:11.813 --> 01:34:13.234]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[01:34:13.234 --> 01:34:13.574]  Oh, man.
[01:34:13.574 --> 01:34:16.314]  I just, I feel, I've never felt like this.
[01:34:16.314 --> 01:34:17.115]  I feel enraged.
[01:34:17.115 --> 01:34:17.715]  I feel sick.
[01:34:17.715 --> 01:34:18.795]  I feel angry.
[01:34:18.795 --> 01:34:20.976]  I just feel like, I mean, I just feel like war.
[01:34:20.976 --> 01:34:22.516]  I just, it's a bad feeling.
[01:34:23.735 --> 01:34:26.596]  Well, you're not alone in that fight.
[01:34:26.596 --> 01:34:27.817]  It's an honor to talk to you.
[01:34:27.817 --> 01:34:31.178]  I've been trying to talk to you for a while.
[01:34:31.178 --> 01:34:32.458]  God bless you for putting up with me, brother.
[01:34:32.458 --> 01:34:34.339]  What's on your mind?
[01:34:34.339 --> 01:34:35.119]  Oh, what's on my mind?
[01:34:35.119 --> 01:34:36.760]  First of all, I just want to listen to the note.
[01:34:36.760 --> 01:34:45.723]  The reason why I started listening to you a few years back, about six, seven years ago, was that the Holy Ghost led me to you.
[01:34:45.723 --> 01:34:52.366]  And the message was, when the first words that I heard come out your mouth, was that the goal in life is to have eternal life.
[01:34:53.123 --> 01:34:55.284]  And this is what I always know in all my life.
[01:34:55.284 --> 01:35:00.787]  And this is what I always try to explain and spread the message and let people understand and let the Holy Ghost do the rest of the work.
[01:35:00.787 --> 01:35:04.969]  So I just want your listeners to know that's the reason why I listen to you.
[01:35:04.969 --> 01:35:07.931]  I was led to you by the Holy Ghost, so I know I'm in the right place.
[01:35:07.931 --> 01:35:09.012]  Describe that process.
[01:35:09.012 --> 01:35:12.473]  What was that like?
[01:35:12.473 --> 01:35:15.415]  That process is just when the Holy Ghost is speaking to you,
[01:35:15.891 --> 01:35:19.192]  It always gives us confirmation.
[01:35:19.192 --> 01:35:23.714]  And the confirmation was that when I heard about you and I said, well, let me check this guy out.
[01:35:23.714 --> 01:35:25.854]  Let me go onto YouTube and check him out.
[01:35:25.854 --> 01:35:31.356]  So when I first turned to you, the first thing I heard you say was that the goal in life is to have eternal life.
[01:35:31.356 --> 01:35:32.997]  That's my goal in life.
[01:35:32.997 --> 01:35:35.078]  And that's actually my goal in life.
[01:35:35.078 --> 01:35:38.479]  And I was just speaking in reference to what you were saying that day.
[01:35:38.479 --> 01:35:43.421]  And I knew I was in the right place because that's what I've experienced all my life.
[01:35:43.421 --> 01:35:44.501]  You have to be spiritually
[01:35:44.932 --> 01:35:45.692]  Yes sir, we are.
[01:35:45.692 --> 01:35:56.739]  What's about to happen, what I think is, we're basically, like a few of you callers this past week has been calling in and saying that we basically have to go through this to get to heaven, to get to the great testament of man.
[01:36:15.111 --> 01:36:15.371]  I think so.
[01:36:34.990 --> 01:36:40.433]  And understanding that and having to deal with that and then fighting with the people that's not on our side.
[01:36:40.433 --> 01:36:43.015]  We just have to accept that and move on.
[01:36:43.015 --> 01:36:44.116]  Powerful testimony, David.
[01:36:44.116 --> 01:36:49.499]  On the other side, tell us about your comments on vaccines exposing lives and more calls.
[01:36:49.499 --> 01:36:50.380]  Everybody, please stay with us.
[01:36:50.380 --> 01:36:52.321]  Jim, Mike, Nicholas, Wild, Joe and others.
[01:36:54.096 --> 01:36:56.698]  A lot of you have been listening for more than 20 years.
[01:36:56.698 --> 01:37:09.486]  And if you go back to those shows, we laid out the AI takeover plan, the tracking of cell phones, how programmed master computers would manipulate control society, how they'd be able to not just predict,
[01:37:10.286 --> 01:37:10.806]  I think?
[01:37:30.037 --> 01:37:34.039]  But when we cover that, the media would attack us and say we were making it up.
[01:37:34.039 --> 01:37:39.281]  It was a conspiracy theory, even though it was in the actual corporate-level blueprint documents.
[01:37:39.281 --> 01:37:47.144]  Well, the next level of the blueprint documents explained to us that they are setting up this control system to make humans obsolete and phase us out.
[01:37:47.144 --> 01:37:50.965]  And it's something about a thousand times crazier than what Hitler planned.
[01:37:50.965 --> 01:37:53.006]  So we might want to dismantle the system now.
[01:37:54.210 --> 01:37:57.172]  America and the world should have never been closed.
[01:37:57.172 --> 01:38:03.695]  It was all based on WHO, Bill and Melinda Gates, Fauci, NIH lies.
[01:38:03.695 --> 01:38:13.860]  But now, here we are, already into August, and they're trying to keep our stores, our factories, our schools, our parks closed.
[01:38:13.860 --> 01:38:15.421]  It is outrageous.
[01:38:16.021 --> 01:38:30.158]  Well, we have launched a new big sale titled Reopen America Back to School Special 50 to 60% off all of our top sellers and double patriot points at InfoWarscore.com.
[01:38:30.158 --> 01:38:33.462]  And despite the fact that our ultimate turmeric formula bodies is selling out,
[01:38:33.962 --> 01:38:36.906]  We still have it at 50% off, but for a limited time.
[01:38:36.906 --> 01:38:40.830]  Living Defense, which is beyond probiotics, 50% off.
[01:38:40.830 --> 01:38:46.757]  Vazo Beets, amazing concentrated beet extract with all of its benefits, selling out, so 50% off.
[01:38:46.757 --> 01:38:50.181]  And so much more at infowarestore.com.
[01:38:50.181 --> 01:38:52.264]  And your purchase funds The Info War, a true 360 win.
[01:38:54.904 --> 01:39:01.889]  It was in the Telecommunications Act of 1996 that all new cell phones would track your GPS location.
[01:39:01.889 --> 01:39:07.312]  I read from the federal law and listeners couldn't believe me because that was un-American.
[01:39:07.312 --> 01:39:24.043]  Now the media admits that almost every app and every company that are on Apple and on Droids don't just track your location, but your surfing history, where you go, who you talk to, your relationships, and they all share the data with each other of what you're doing on the apps as well,
[01:39:24.804 --> 01:39:25.364]  I think so.
[01:39:54.946 --> 01:40:02.457]  One of our best-selling products is Living Defense, and it's been sold out for over four months because it's hard to source the ingredients that are organic.
[01:40:02.457 --> 01:40:08.646]  We've got a limited supply right now, but it's selling out fast, and I want those of you that haven't experienced Living Defense to get it for yourself.
[01:40:08.646 --> 01:40:10.108]  Here's just part of one testimonial.
[01:40:10.328 --> 01:40:12.991]  Look, in January 2016, I went in a hospital.
[01:40:12.991 --> 01:40:16.494]  I went in a VA hospital out here in Boise, and I was in there until June.
[01:40:16.494 --> 01:40:25.763]  And one of the only things that got me through that ordeal was listening to InfoWars three hours a day, and I kept hearing Dr. Group and all you guys talking about living defense.
[01:40:25.763 --> 01:40:26.664]  Let me tell you something, man.
[01:40:26.764 --> 01:40:33.610]  I had an internal digestive problem and I suffered with it for about five or six years and the doctors, they tried every test.
[01:40:33.610 --> 01:40:35.091]  Nobody could figure out what it is.
[01:40:35.091 --> 01:40:39.094]  And then every day when I kept hearing you and Dr. Group and those commercials, I said, you know what?
[01:40:39.094 --> 01:40:41.276]  I'm going to get me some of that freaking Living Defense.
[01:40:41.276 --> 01:40:46.160]  Now, I wasn't supposed to have any nutritionals because they don't want you to have that stuff, but I ordered it, had it shipped to me.
[01:40:46.160 --> 01:40:46.700]  I got it.
[01:40:46.700 --> 01:40:47.941]  I hid it from the nurses.
[01:40:47.941 --> 01:40:48.982]  I started taking it.
[01:40:48.982 --> 01:40:51.024]  Man, that stuff changed my life.
[01:40:51.024 --> 01:40:51.965]  It saved my life.
[01:40:51.965 --> 01:40:54.667]  Alex Jones and InfoWars saved my life.
[01:40:57.654 --> 01:41:00.259]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[01:41:14.781 --> 01:41:20.905]  The economy's going into a global depression.
[01:41:20.905 --> 01:41:25.468]  People are starving to death everywhere.
[01:41:25.468 --> 01:41:31.171]  In the West, Americans owe 21 billion in back rent.
[01:41:42.955 --> 01:41:47.999]  Up to half of small businesses that have closed will never reopen.
[01:41:47.999 --> 01:41:57.625]  It just makes me sick to watch them say it's COVID doing it, when it's the lockdown that did it, and everything they have put out about it's been a lie.
[01:41:57.625 --> 01:42:01.588]  And then Dr. Gates decides who can be on the internet and who can't.
[01:42:01.588 --> 01:42:05.390]  We just wake up in this nightmare, and it gets worse and worse.
[01:42:05.390 --> 01:42:08.252]  And I was downtown today with Steven Crowder.
[01:42:08.252 --> 01:42:10.074]  We're going back to your calls right now.
[01:42:10.074 --> 01:42:10.594]  Back to David.
[01:42:13.604 --> 01:42:19.666]  And no one was around by the police station that they've announced they want to blow up the city council.
[01:42:19.666 --> 01:42:22.787]  In the budget.
[01:42:22.787 --> 01:42:27.308]  And Owen pulls up the armored vehicle.
[01:42:27.308 --> 01:42:30.329]  Going USA, USA as he pulls up.
[01:42:30.329 --> 01:42:33.710]  There's like an empty street out there.
[01:42:33.710 --> 01:42:38.052]  And all of a sudden these women boil out of the shadows, white women.
[01:42:38.052 --> 01:42:41.253]  Had like wagons with dogs and stuff and they go F you and F America.
[01:42:42.346 --> 01:42:44.047]  And I'm like, but you live off America.
[01:42:44.047 --> 01:42:44.868]  Why do you want it to fail?
[01:42:44.868 --> 01:42:45.808]  He goes, F you!
[01:42:45.808 --> 01:42:49.951]  And all these homeless boil out and go, F America, F America.
[01:42:49.951 --> 01:42:57.315]  And I could have got out and got footage of it, but it was so sick that I just, I just drove off and came to the office.
[01:42:57.315 --> 01:43:00.197]  He was driving around and he brought the car so I could get it.
[01:43:00.197 --> 01:43:01.357]  He left with the security guys.
[01:43:01.357 --> 01:43:08.582]  And it was just, it was, it was the craziness of how
[01:43:11.308 --> 01:43:16.390]  If you're an old person and you don't pay your income tax, they'll take your house and throw you out of your house.
[01:43:16.390 --> 01:43:20.471]  If you're a homeless person, you get all this free stuff and then you hate the country.
[01:43:20.471 --> 01:43:23.932]  But it's homeless people didn't used to say we hate America.
[01:43:23.932 --> 01:43:29.894]  The Democrats have successfully made it the operating system to know they're part of a foreign power.
[01:43:29.894 --> 01:43:38.257]  China ships them the fentanyl, Hollywood hates America, they're in the club, they're the winners, and now all these leftist and homeless people and weirdos
[01:43:39.364 --> 01:43:47.652]  No, they're part of the team, like an army of zombies to defecate everywhere and shoot up with needles, and then we're defeated by it?
[01:43:47.652 --> 01:43:49.213]  It's like an army of zombies.
[01:43:49.213 --> 01:43:50.534]  Joe Biden's a zombie.
[01:43:50.534 --> 01:43:51.875]  Hillary's a zombie.
[01:43:51.875 --> 01:43:53.277]  Maxine Waters is a zombie.
[01:43:53.277 --> 01:44:00.403]  The Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, is a zombie.
[01:44:00.403 --> 01:44:01.544]  But it's on purpose.
[01:44:01.544 --> 01:44:03.946]  It's like, yeah, you think you're so strong?
[01:44:03.946 --> 01:44:05.488]  You're ruled by zombies.
[01:44:08.188 --> 01:44:15.653]  I mean, I was downtown, folks, and there were drug addicts laying on the ground with sores all over them.
[01:44:15.653 --> 01:44:17.114]  It smelled so bad.
[01:44:17.114 --> 01:44:19.436]  And it was like something out of a movie.
[01:44:19.436 --> 01:44:23.579]  They're like quarreling around the corner, and there's feces everywhere.
[01:44:23.579 --> 01:44:27.381]  And it's just like, what happened to where I live?
[01:44:27.381 --> 01:44:28.262]  Overnight!
[01:44:28.262 --> 01:44:32.125]  Because the Democrats run the drugs.
[01:44:33.254 --> 01:44:42.059]  And they get the left to pass higher money for homeless, and they get that homeless check, and they take it, and they sell them the fentanyl on top of it.
[01:44:42.059 --> 01:44:49.583]  The City Council of Austin, except for one or two members, are drug-dealing, psychotic murderers.
[01:44:49.583 --> 01:44:52.604]  They caught them running human trafficking, you name it.
[01:44:52.604 --> 01:44:55.746]  I mean, that's all this is, folks, is a total criminal track record.
[01:44:55.746 --> 01:44:58.207]  All right, I'm gonna shut up, I'm sorry.
[01:44:58.207 --> 01:45:02.630]  David in California, get into vaccines, and what else you were talking about, sir, thank you.
[01:45:03.786 --> 01:45:04.766]  Yes, sir.
[01:45:04.766 --> 01:45:06.607]  First of all, I'm a black Trump supporter.
[01:45:06.607 --> 01:45:07.887]  Also, I'm an ex-felon.
[01:45:07.887 --> 01:45:10.228]  I'm from the area where you grew up at.
[01:45:10.228 --> 01:45:10.888]  I'm from Texas.
[01:45:10.888 --> 01:45:12.829]  I went to Westwood Junior High.
[01:45:12.829 --> 01:45:16.130]  I'm from Dallas, Texas, the Plano area.
[01:45:16.130 --> 01:45:17.990]  And like I said, it's an honor to speak with you.
[01:45:17.990 --> 01:45:20.671]  And also, I want to just speak about the vaccines a little bit.
[01:45:20.671 --> 01:45:29.254]  When I was incarcerated back in 2000 and 2001, I was not able to make parole unless I took the hepatitis A and B vaccine shot.
[01:45:30.382 --> 01:45:38.665]  And I was forced to take it and I just want the listeners to know that before any vaccine is released to the public, it's always tested inside the penitentiary.
[01:45:38.665 --> 01:45:48.308]  I guarantee you right now there's people already have the vaccine for COVID-19 to make parole or before they release it out of the penitentiary and TDCJ facilities.
[01:45:48.308 --> 01:45:49.409]  I guarantee you.
[01:45:49.409 --> 01:45:53.110]  Also to fight against this where we're at now about kids going to school.
[01:45:53.110 --> 01:45:57.972]  They can compare the numbers, the flu numbers to kids being infected with the fluenza.
[01:45:59.019 --> 01:46:00.720]  It's all, sir, you're absolutely right.
[01:46:00.720 --> 01:46:04.063]  I wish the American people understood stuff like you do.
[01:46:04.063 --> 01:46:06.705]  They're saying this has an infection rate and death rate three-quarters
[01:46:28.496 --> 01:46:39.223]  It's one quarter of what the flu is, and that's with inflated numbers, and then they admit that they're counting all these other people that died of something else.
[01:46:39.223 --> 01:46:41.184]  I mean, it's just a giant fraud.
[01:46:41.184 --> 01:46:42.464]  It doesn't mean there isn't real pneumonia.
[01:46:42.464 --> 01:46:43.805]  It doesn't mean people don't really die.
[01:46:43.805 --> 01:46:44.986]  That's always happening.
[01:46:44.986 --> 01:46:47.508]  And so it's just crazy how they're saying it's never going to end.
[01:46:47.508 --> 01:46:48.528]  David, thank you so much.
[01:46:48.528 --> 01:46:50.069]  Good to hear from you.
[01:46:50.069 --> 01:46:50.429]  All right.
[01:46:50.429 --> 01:46:51.890]  Again, I really appreciate callers holding.
[01:46:51.890 --> 01:46:53.851]  Jim in Kentucky, then Mike and others.
[01:46:53.851 --> 01:46:54.512]  Jim, welcome, sir.
[01:46:55.612 --> 01:46:59.994]  Yes, I'd like you to go ahead and throw away our cell phones.
[01:46:59.994 --> 01:47:00.675]  We don't need them.
[01:47:00.675 --> 01:47:02.916]  Get our landlines back.
[01:47:02.916 --> 01:47:05.057]  Go ahead and get rid of our computers.
[01:47:05.057 --> 01:47:05.998]  We don't need those.
[01:47:05.998 --> 01:47:08.019]  We'll go back old school.
[01:47:08.019 --> 01:47:10.080]  Old school's the only school.
[01:47:10.080 --> 01:47:18.865]  As in for you having your hate, you might want to take some yoga classes to understand the more angry they make you, the more they control you.
[01:47:19.775 --> 01:47:21.156]  There ain't no sense in getting mad.
[01:47:21.156 --> 01:47:22.277]  That ain't gonna change nothing.
[01:47:22.277 --> 01:47:23.418]  Sir, I know that.
[01:47:23.418 --> 01:47:24.538]  I agree with you.
[01:47:24.538 --> 01:47:26.880]  I pray to not get... It's not even angry.
[01:47:26.880 --> 01:47:28.261]  I'm sick of it.
[01:47:28.261 --> 01:47:30.242]  I'm sick of looking at him.
[01:47:30.242 --> 01:47:31.924]  It's not even... I'm just... It's disgust.
[01:47:31.924 --> 01:47:34.345]  How do I deal with disgust then?
[01:47:34.345 --> 01:47:36.267]  Well, you gotta just relax.
[01:47:36.267 --> 01:47:37.728]  You gotta relax.
[01:47:37.728 --> 01:47:42.391]  You think clear, your body's under less stress when you relax.
[01:47:43.100 --> 01:47:47.641]  No, I agree with you, but one reason we've been effective is I am upset to get people out of their comfort zone.
[01:47:47.641 --> 01:47:48.762]  There's got to be a balance.
[01:47:48.762 --> 01:47:54.344]  Because I, you know, I mean... And he was on the front line.
[01:47:54.344 --> 01:47:56.604]  I'll guarantee you it was as cool as Joe Montana.
[01:47:56.604 --> 01:47:57.445]  Who are you talking about?
[01:47:57.445 --> 01:47:58.105]  Joe Montana.
[01:47:59.167 --> 01:48:05.411]  George Washington, our founding father, when he was battling the British, and we kept losing and losing and losing.
[01:48:05.411 --> 01:48:07.512]  He didn't get mad if you, you know what I mean?
[01:48:07.512 --> 01:48:08.573]  He kept cool.
[01:48:08.573 --> 01:48:10.054]  Like Joe Montana.
[01:48:10.054 --> 01:48:12.195]  Game looks like it's over, okay?
[01:48:12.195 --> 01:48:13.796]  Cole Joe's there.
[01:48:13.796 --> 01:48:16.158]  Joe doesn't get angry.
[01:48:16.158 --> 01:48:18.079]  Joe pulls it out.
[01:48:18.079 --> 01:48:22.602]  There was so many victories he had where it looked like it was impossible.
[01:48:22.602 --> 01:48:24.783]  You got to get that Joe Montana attitude.
[01:48:26.045 --> 01:48:26.746]  Well, I do.
[01:48:26.746 --> 01:48:28.569]  I mean, I don't ever give up.
[01:48:28.569 --> 01:48:32.775]  I just particularly feel really nasty right now and really pissed off at these people.
[01:48:32.775 --> 01:48:33.817]  And I agree with you.
[01:48:33.817 --> 01:48:38.083]  I've got to somehow just give it to God and be cool about it because I can't let them eat me up.
[01:48:38.083 --> 01:48:38.944]  I mean, here's the problem.
[01:48:40.956 --> 01:48:45.697]  They deserve to be dealt with physically for what they've done, but I know they'll set it up and hurt us if we do that.
[01:48:45.697 --> 01:48:53.259]  What do you do when people are assaulting you, and Bill Gates is coming with a poison vaccine, and he admits it's going to hurt you, and we know a bunch of ignorant people are going to get hurt by it?
[01:48:53.259 --> 01:49:00.761]  I, as a man, and I've never been somebody that shoots my mouth open about physical stuff, I'm being honest with the audience, I feel physically angry towards these people.
[01:49:00.761 --> 01:49:03.742]  I'm not hating them, I want to get them off our back.
[01:49:03.742 --> 01:49:05.342]  Do you understand what I'm saying?
[01:49:05.342 --> 01:49:08.623]  Yes, but if you get rid of your cell phones, then you don't have no Bill Gates.
[01:49:09.147 --> 01:49:11.969]  You get rid of your computer, you have no Bill Gates.
[01:49:11.969 --> 01:49:13.430]  You lose his control.
[01:49:13.430 --> 01:49:14.111]  No, you're right.
[01:49:14.111 --> 01:49:16.353]  We have to... Exactly.
[01:49:16.353 --> 01:49:17.234]  And it's a balance.
[01:49:17.234 --> 01:49:19.055]  Who's gonna be on the grid and off the grid?
[01:49:19.055 --> 01:49:20.216]  I agree with you, though.
[01:49:20.216 --> 01:49:21.817]  This whole thing's a trap.
[01:49:21.817 --> 01:49:22.958]  Not that technology's bad.
[01:49:22.958 --> 01:49:25.440]  It's that they've set it up as a trap.
[01:49:25.440 --> 01:49:26.481]  Like a fish trap.
[01:49:26.481 --> 01:49:30.404]  Fish will swim into something to get food, but they're scared to swim out.
[01:49:30.404 --> 01:49:32.145]  It's psychological.
[01:49:32.145 --> 01:49:33.807]  And so now we're in the trap.
[01:49:33.807 --> 01:49:35.228]  What do we do?
[01:49:35.228 --> 01:49:37.690]  You lived without the cell phone before the cell phone.
[01:49:38.462 --> 01:49:40.026]  Get your landline back.
[01:49:40.026 --> 01:49:40.307]  Okay?
[01:49:40.307 --> 01:49:41.630]  No more cell phones.
[01:49:41.630 --> 01:49:42.693]  No more being tracked.
[01:49:43.720 --> 01:49:47.063]  You don't need to know or talk to anybody until you get home.
[01:49:47.063 --> 01:49:48.184]  They'll just wait like they did before.
[01:49:48.184 --> 01:49:49.244]  Well, it was so fun, too.
[01:49:49.244 --> 01:49:55.870]  We'd talk about meet-ups, where we're gonna meet on Saturday night or Wednesday night, or we'll meet at church, we'll meet at this hamburger place.
[01:49:55.870 --> 01:50:00.033]  It was fun because everyone was there, and that was the scene.
[01:50:00.033 --> 01:50:02.555]  And I'd have like a little notepad, even when I was a teenager.
[01:50:02.555 --> 01:50:07.358]  I had phone numbers of girls and stuff or whatever, but I knew hundreds of numbers.
[01:50:07.358 --> 01:50:10.541]  I mean, I knew hundreds of numbers, and now it does it all for you.
[01:50:10.541 --> 01:50:12.883]  And you're right, all of it dehumanizes us.
[01:50:13.592 --> 01:50:18.315]  Look at the couples that are fighting on the cell phones because they're talking to each other too much.
[01:50:18.315 --> 01:50:21.116]  A problem happens at home, the guy can't get home.
[01:50:21.116 --> 01:50:22.036]  He's got to work.
[01:50:22.036 --> 01:50:24.638]  Knowing that problem, it makes him angry.
[01:50:24.638 --> 01:50:26.039]  No, you're absolutely right.
[01:50:26.039 --> 01:50:30.301]  It totally screws up couples that she tells you what's going on and you tell her what's going on.
[01:50:30.301 --> 01:50:33.763]  Instead of like, the fun of not seeing her until you get home.
[01:50:33.763 --> 01:50:36.724]  And the mystery of it, you know?
[01:50:36.724 --> 01:50:39.025]  And you can't take care of him until you get home anyway.
[01:50:39.025 --> 01:50:39.826]  That's the whole thing.
[01:50:42.540 --> 01:50:43.841]  Well, you're a smart philosopher, Jim.
[01:50:43.841 --> 01:50:45.762]  What else should we do?
[01:50:45.762 --> 01:50:56.849]  Well, I think if we go ahead and blow off Bill Gates and start protesting at Pfizer, start protesting at these places where the vaccines are being mated.
[01:50:56.849 --> 01:50:57.869]  Give them hell!
[01:50:57.869 --> 01:50:59.971]  We got a lot of people who are unemployed.
[01:50:59.971 --> 01:51:04.133]  Let's use those people as an army to protest at these positions.
[01:51:04.133 --> 01:51:07.335]  They won't know how to handle that.
[01:51:07.335 --> 01:51:09.396]  Protest at Pelosi's mansion.
[01:51:09.396 --> 01:51:10.637]  She won't know how to handle it.
[01:51:22.701 --> 01:51:25.162]  Well, you don't sound too yoga'd out now, brother, but I hear you.
[01:51:25.162 --> 01:51:26.463]  You're not hateful.
[01:51:26.463 --> 01:51:27.123]  You're not angry.
[01:51:27.123 --> 01:51:28.184]  You're just taking action.
[01:51:28.184 --> 01:51:29.325]  That's the spirit we have to have.
[01:51:29.325 --> 01:51:29.905]  You're damn right.
[01:51:29.905 --> 01:51:31.526]  You're absolutely right, brother.
[01:51:32.662 --> 01:51:33.965]  All right.
[01:51:33.965 --> 01:51:34.746]  We'll be right back.
[01:51:34.746 --> 01:51:36.029]  The next hour, Warrior Calls.
[01:51:36.029 --> 01:51:39.356]  Edward Stroyer and Savannah Hernandez are kicking butt in studio.
[01:51:39.356 --> 01:51:41.140]  And then, another special guest.
[01:51:43.584 --> 01:52:00.255]  Whether you believe in evolution in the modern theory or not, the globalist controllers do, and they constantly write about and talk about how they want to create a global crisis or a group of crises that force humans to, quote, evolve in a new, better way.
[01:52:00.255 --> 01:52:03.397]  Now, when you study how they actually want you to evolve, if you believe in that,
[01:52:03.917 --> 01:52:08.100]  It is to stop having children and merge with silicon bodies and a post-human future.
[01:52:08.100 --> 01:52:09.561]  Talk about psychotic.
[01:52:09.561 --> 01:52:10.842]  Talk about creepy.
[01:52:10.842 --> 01:52:11.762]  Talk about crazy.
[01:52:11.762 --> 01:52:28.773]  But they need an event like COVID-19 to teach a mammal to wear some covering over its nose, over its breathing tubes, to set the precedent for the forced inoculations, for the GMO, for the 5G, and for all the things that they admit will end our humanity as we know it.
[01:52:29.093 --> 01:52:30.536]  That's why this is so evil.
[01:52:30.536 --> 01:52:39.349]  Their whole agenda for a cashless society, global government, UN control, getting us all into debt, getting rid of local government.
[01:52:39.349 --> 01:52:40.772]  Think about all the facets of it.
[01:52:40.772 --> 01:52:42.695]  The censorship, the surveillance.
[01:52:44.907 --> 01:52:47.589]  I have never been so concerned about what's going on.
[01:52:47.589 --> 01:52:58.836]  This is all martial law prepping, martial law training, and now they have activated the most criminal elements, the deep state, and Pelosi is bragging they're going to remove the President illegally with COG.
[01:52:58.836 --> 01:53:00.457]  You cannot remove the President with COG.
[01:53:00.457 --> 01:53:05.220]  You can't remove the President, 25th Amendment or impeachment, but they're saying they're going to do it.
[01:53:05.220 --> 01:53:13.706]  Ladies and gentlemen, they are putting this in every newspaper in the country and legitimizing the fact that if he contests the election in any way, when they say by default they are,
[01:53:14.286 --> 01:53:15.386]  They're going to pull this.
[01:53:15.386 --> 01:53:17.987]  This is maximum, maximum alert.
[01:53:17.987 --> 01:53:19.207]  This is emergency alert.
[01:53:19.207 --> 01:53:23.168]  Yes, they've censored the Patriots off most of the internet, but Banned.Video is still there.
[01:53:23.168 --> 01:53:24.348]  The radio show is still there.
[01:53:24.348 --> 01:53:28.549]  And yes, we're getting about five times the traffic we were getting before the ban to the actual sites.
[01:53:28.549 --> 01:53:32.310]  But we need to get this message to other people outside of our audience.
[01:53:32.310 --> 01:53:36.430]  So tell everyone now about the Marshall Law Plan and the plan to get rid of Trump.
[01:53:36.430 --> 01:53:38.611]  It's all posted at Banned.Video.
[01:53:38.611 --> 01:53:40.311]  Please, we can defeat these people.
[01:53:40.311 --> 01:53:42.452]  If you take action, you are the answer.
[01:53:42.452 --> 01:53:43.852]  Please, please, please.
[01:53:47.071 --> 01:53:49.682]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:53:56.640 --> 01:53:57.861]  You found it.
[01:53:57.861 --> 01:53:59.881]  The tip of the spear.
[01:53:59.881 --> 01:54:02.442]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:02.442 --> 01:54:06.263]  You know I think that's part of it is no one were really right about all this.
[01:54:06.263 --> 01:54:13.165]  I mean I studied the globalist writings and I knew they were planning all this but to actually see them implement it all and to know it's about to get a lot worse.
[01:54:13.165 --> 01:54:13.946]  Here's the thing.
[01:54:13.946 --> 01:54:16.086]  We've gone off the edge of the cliff.
[01:54:16.086 --> 01:54:17.467]  Everything else was the build-up to that.
[01:54:18.667 --> 01:54:25.250]  And I just pray to God to heal this land and for the world to wake up and say no, because the road we're going down is so horrible.
[01:54:25.250 --> 01:54:37.136]  But every time I look at my three-year-old daughter or my other children, I marvel that people would join Satan willingly and would be so stupid.
[01:54:37.136 --> 01:54:40.898]  I think that's really what upsets me the most.
[01:54:40.898 --> 01:54:47.241]  And I just feel like I need to renaissance what I'm doing.
[01:54:47.241 --> 01:54:48.102]  And I need to get aggressive.
[01:54:50.140 --> 01:54:51.881]  In a non-violent way.
[01:54:51.881 --> 01:54:56.024]  That means right up to the edge of that.
[01:54:56.024 --> 01:55:00.828]  To put the fear of God into these scumbags that are doing this to us.
[01:55:00.828 --> 01:55:06.592]  I mean, Bill Gates is saying, I'm coming with a vaccine that's gonna kill and hurt a bunch of people, and you're gonna take it.
[01:55:07.619 --> 01:55:12.143]  Well, imagine if I said, hey, I cooked something up in my garage, Gates, I'm gonna come stick a needle in you, make you take it.
[01:55:12.143 --> 01:55:13.685]  They'd have SWAT teams attacking you.
[01:55:13.685 --> 01:55:14.506]  And they should.
[01:55:14.506 --> 01:55:21.833]  But this little crazy man, he's paid everybody off because he wants in my body, and he hangs out with a child molester, Jeffrey Epstein!
[01:55:23.643 --> 01:55:24.903]  He doesn't want to molest children, folks.
[01:55:24.903 --> 01:55:27.084]  He's into the blackmail of scientists.
[01:55:27.084 --> 01:55:34.407]  He wants power over humans to turn us into a frankenfood with their DNA vaccine that changes your cells.
[01:55:34.407 --> 01:55:38.208]  And, again, I was telling Steven Crowder this today, he's a smart guy, and he goes, really?
[01:55:38.208 --> 01:55:40.849]  They've got a vaccine that changes your DNA?
[01:55:40.849 --> 01:55:42.490]  And I said, yes, Steven, they do.
[01:55:42.490 --> 01:55:45.691]  It's like when I tell you they were having animal-human clones 20 years ago.
[01:55:45.691 --> 01:55:47.172]  It's in the mainline literature.
[01:55:47.172 --> 01:55:49.893]  Now people go, oh my God, it's true, but let's just move on from it.
[01:55:51.667 --> 01:55:53.808]  Like there's 3 million Uyghurs in death camps.
[01:55:53.808 --> 01:55:58.829]  Like, oh there's 3 million in death camps, but 14 black guys got killed by cops.
[01:55:58.829 --> 01:56:00.910]  Let's obsess over that and burn the country down.
[01:56:00.910 --> 01:56:03.431]  And then meanwhile they're killing millions of blacks in abortion laws.
[01:56:03.431 --> 01:56:04.491]  We don't care about that!
[01:56:04.491 --> 01:56:06.392]  14 black guys died.
[01:56:06.392 --> 01:56:19.536]  This is all a sick joke!
[01:56:19.536 --> 01:56:20.596]  Kill your calls and shut up.
[01:56:24.540 --> 01:56:28.501]  Mike in California, thanks for holding it on the air.
[01:56:28.501 --> 01:56:29.881]  Alex, I love you.
[01:56:29.881 --> 01:56:39.044]  Um, I've been listening to you for every single day for years now, and, um, I discovered you from, uh, Dave Mustaine and from Billy Corgan interviews, actually.
[01:56:39.044 --> 01:56:41.924]  And then I started checking you out and I got woken up.
[01:56:41.924 --> 01:56:48.826]  Um, I just want to plug really quick, uh, X2, um, Turbo Force, uh, the real red pill.
[01:56:48.826 --> 01:56:52.027]  And then I just took DNA Force for the first time and it was amazing.
[01:56:52.027 --> 01:56:53.287]  So, um, anyways,
[01:56:53.826 --> 01:56:54.547]  I'm locked and loaded.
[01:56:54.547 --> 01:56:57.468]  I got a point for you here today.
[01:56:57.468 --> 01:57:08.415]  First point I wanted to make is back in 1908, there was a meeting between intelligence and press people called the Empire Press Corps back in 1908.
[01:57:08.415 --> 01:57:13.799]  This was a globalist consortium where they basically said, okay, this is what we need to do.
[01:57:13.799 --> 01:57:21.184]  We need to control the narrative airtight and we need to control all the media in order to do that.
[01:57:21.184 --> 01:57:22.484]  And then so you look at that back in 1908,
[01:57:24.085 --> 01:57:34.034]  And then you look at Julian Huxley, who you mentioned a couple days ago on the show, you know, talking about the globalist plan.
[01:57:34.034 --> 01:57:41.760]  And what makes me bring this up is that you have to supplant the word globalist with Satan.
[01:57:41.760 --> 01:57:44.743]  Because this isn't a man that's doing this, obviously.
[01:57:44.743 --> 01:57:46.184]  I mean, we're talking 1908.
[01:57:46.184 --> 01:57:48.266]  We're talking Julian Huxley was saying that back in the 40s.
[01:57:48.266 --> 01:57:49.667]  You know, this is
[01:57:50.515 --> 01:57:52.217]  Such a long period of time.
[01:57:52.217 --> 01:57:55.400]  This is Satan controlling these people, right?
[01:57:55.400 --> 01:57:56.642]  No, I totally agree with you.
[01:57:56.642 --> 01:58:00.126]  I use the term globalist because that's what they were calling themselves 60 years ago.
[01:58:00.126 --> 01:58:02.869]  They want global government so you can't escape.
[01:58:02.869 --> 01:58:05.652]  Globalism is just to get the control.
[01:58:05.652 --> 01:58:07.894]  Planetary rule is just for the control.
[01:58:07.894 --> 01:58:09.516]  What comes after it is pure Satanism.
[01:58:09.516 --> 01:58:10.136]  You're absolutely right.
[01:58:11.010 --> 01:58:11.651]  No, you're right.
[01:58:11.651 --> 01:58:17.675]  And you, and you have been on it, and you're... I'm talking to the godfather here who woke me up.
[01:58:17.675 --> 01:58:19.677]  Brother, let me tell you this.
[01:58:19.677 --> 01:58:21.619]  I'm not the godfather or anything.
[01:58:21.619 --> 01:58:23.800]  I'm just somebody that doesn't want to be a slave.
[01:58:23.800 --> 01:58:24.881]  Here's the thing.
[01:58:24.881 --> 01:58:27.283]  People need to know, this has all been out there before.
[01:58:27.283 --> 01:58:28.624]  But now we're going to live through it.
[01:58:28.624 --> 01:58:29.225]  What do you think of that?
[01:58:30.416 --> 01:58:31.756]  Well, no, so that's my point.
[01:58:31.756 --> 01:58:35.137]  So my next point was, um, you had a guest on recently.
[01:58:35.137 --> 01:58:35.478]  Hold on.
[01:58:35.478 --> 01:58:37.738]  We got, we got Owen Schroeder and Savannah Hernandez coming in.
[01:58:37.738 --> 01:58:39.539]  They're going to cover stuff, but we'll get to everybody.
[01:58:39.539 --> 01:58:41.960]  Mike, we'll finish up with you, Nicholas, Wild, and Joe.
[01:58:41.960 --> 01:58:44.080]  We'll get to every one of you before this hour ends.
[01:58:44.080 --> 01:58:45.641]  And then another guest host is coming up.
[01:58:45.641 --> 01:58:47.321]  Who's doing the fourth hour today?
[01:58:47.321 --> 01:58:48.442]  Let me tell you who's doing that.
[01:58:48.442 --> 01:58:49.222]  John Rappaport.
[01:58:49.222 --> 01:58:52.563]  Oh, that'll be good.
[01:58:52.563 --> 01:58:55.944]  The reasons that the globalists launch this planetary lockdown.
[01:58:56.721 --> 01:59:00.925]  The number one reason is it serves every one of their purposes.
[01:59:00.925 --> 01:59:05.388]  We've gone over those purposes many times here on air.
[01:59:05.388 --> 01:59:11.453]  The cashless society, the surveillance system, global government, medical tyranny, forced inoculation.
[01:59:11.453 --> 01:59:25.625]  But the most important facet is it teaches us that we are obsolete, that we are non-essential as we begin to witness automation computers and robots take over the jobs that people once had
[01:59:26.107 --> 01:59:27.708]  By design.
[01:59:27.708 --> 01:59:31.750]  This isn't like it's some advancement that we just fell into.
[01:59:31.750 --> 01:59:34.872]  It's been pre-planned, organized globally.
[01:59:34.872 --> 01:59:37.133]  And it's extremely predatory.
[01:59:37.133 --> 01:59:48.920]  And through governmental actuaries and tax programs and regulations, the central banks that control it all are able to pick the winners and the losers and consolidate power.
[01:59:48.920 --> 01:59:52.022]  This is the truest form of technocracy fascism.
[01:59:56.607 --> 02:00:03.071]  This program contains language and sequences some viewers may find disturbing.
[02:00:03.071 --> 02:00:06.393]  The nation and all of our freedoms hang by a thread!
[02:00:06.393 --> 02:00:09.995]  And the military apparatus of this country is about to be handed over to scum!
[02:00:09.995 --> 02:00:12.397]  For beholden to scum!
[02:00:12.397 --> 02:00:13.097]  Russian scum!
[02:00:13.097 --> 02:00:13.998]  Listen.
[02:00:13.998 --> 02:00:22.743]  Please listen.
[02:00:22.743 --> 02:00:24.344]  If you don't, if you won't,
[02:00:25.370 --> 02:00:31.035]  If you fail to understand, then the same incredible terror that's menacing me will strike at you!
[02:00:31.035 --> 02:00:35.178]  The function of all life is survival.
[02:00:35.178 --> 02:00:37.180]  Sleep.
[02:00:37.180 --> 02:00:39.141]  Sleep.
[02:00:39.141 --> 02:00:40.603]  Sleep.
[02:00:40.603 --> 02:00:41.103]  Oh my God!
[02:00:41.103 --> 02:00:41.683]  Oh my God!
[02:00:41.683 --> 02:00:42.024]  Oh my God!
[02:00:42.024 --> 02:00:42.804]  Lock the door!
[02:00:42.804 --> 02:00:43.285]  Lock the door!
[02:00:43.285 --> 02:00:44.186]  They're coming!
[02:00:44.186 --> 02:00:45.346]  They're coming!
[02:00:45.346 --> 02:00:46.047]  Help!
[02:00:46.047 --> 02:00:46.768]  Help!
[02:00:46.768 --> 02:00:47.728]  They're coming!
[02:00:47.728 --> 02:00:48.449]  They're coming!
[02:00:48.449 --> 02:00:49.390]  Listen to me!
[02:00:49.390 --> 02:00:49.710]  Listen!
[02:00:51.764 --> 02:00:52.404]  Alex, please!
[02:00:52.404 --> 02:00:53.025]  Please!
[02:00:53.025 --> 02:00:54.585]  Your legs are in danger!
[02:00:54.585 --> 02:00:55.486]  Please, listen to me!
[02:00:55.486 --> 02:00:56.666]  It's something terrible!
[02:00:56.666 --> 02:00:57.927]  Please!
[02:00:57.927 --> 02:00:59.508]  Your legs are in the air!
[02:00:59.508 --> 02:01:01.989]  They're already here!
[02:01:01.989 --> 02:01:02.649]  Alex, your legs!
[02:01:02.649 --> 02:01:03.270]  They're coming!
[02:01:03.270 --> 02:01:04.350]  They're coming!
[02:01:04.350 --> 02:01:05.171]  Sleep.
[02:01:05.171 --> 02:01:06.331]  The seed is planted.
[02:01:06.331 --> 02:01:08.292]  Sleep.
[02:01:08.292 --> 02:01:09.213]  Sleep.
[02:01:09.213 --> 02:01:10.433]  Terror grows.
[02:01:10.433 --> 02:01:12.554]  Elizabeth, wake up!
[02:01:12.554 --> 02:01:14.135]  We'll get you when you sleep!
[02:01:14.135 --> 02:01:15.796]  Sit up!
[02:01:15.796 --> 02:01:17.957]  Invasion of the Body Snatchers.
[02:01:19.435 --> 02:01:21.637]  All of a sudden they're growing like parasites.
[02:01:21.637 --> 02:01:23.940]  Is it contagious?
[02:01:23.940 --> 02:01:26.082]  It looked right at me.
[02:01:26.082 --> 02:01:26.903]  You need to get out!
[02:01:26.903 --> 02:01:28.625]  You're looking at it as if it was human.
[02:01:28.625 --> 02:01:31.488]  It was not human.
[02:01:31.488 --> 02:01:34.571]  Now, the classic fear begins to grow.
[02:01:34.571 --> 02:01:36.373]  We're being cornered!
[02:01:36.373 --> 02:01:40.156]  In a modern masterpiece of science fiction.
[02:02:06.764 --> 02:02:11.768]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:02:11.768 --> 02:02:16.292]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:02:16.292 --> 02:02:21.196]  Ladies and gentlemen, there is so much to cover and so many calls to get to.
[02:02:21.196 --> 02:02:28.802]  Let's finish up with Mike in California, and then we will get to Savannah Hernandez and Owen Schroer that are in studio with us here in just a moment.
[02:02:28.802 --> 02:02:32.125]  Mike, finishing up your points on spiritual war that's taking place.
[02:02:32.125 --> 02:02:33.466]  That is exactly what's going on.
[02:02:35.222 --> 02:02:36.723]  Yeah, thank you.
[02:02:36.723 --> 02:02:43.286]  So, you had a guest on a few... You're a little muffled now.
[02:02:43.286 --> 02:02:46.048]  Move your hand away from the telephone.
[02:02:46.048 --> 02:02:48.029]  Okay, can you hear me okay now?
[02:02:48.029 --> 02:02:49.870]  I hear you better, yeah, go ahead.
[02:02:49.870 --> 02:02:53.551]  Okay, so you had a guest on a couple weeks ago named Bishop Gators.
[02:02:53.551 --> 02:02:54.532]  Yeah, he's a good guy.
[02:02:54.532 --> 02:02:55.332]  People like him.
[02:02:55.332 --> 02:02:56.073]  Oh, awesome.
[02:02:56.073 --> 02:03:00.275]  Yeah, so I listened to a podcast with him a couple days ago with a doctor.
[02:03:00.876 --> 02:03:10.840]  And he was talking about this nanotechnology that Bill Gates wants to inject in everybody, that's going to be communicating with Wi-Fi towers and everything, and it's called Hydrogel.
[02:03:10.840 --> 02:03:23.165]  And he was breaking down that Hydrogel, translated in Latin, literally translates to Lucifer, and it actually is going to change your DNA and turn you into a Luciferian being.
[02:03:23.165 --> 02:03:27.807]  So, I mean, what we're trying to do... Sir, I was telling... I was telling...
[02:03:28.729 --> 02:03:41.373]  Steven Crowder this today, Bill Gates on record on PBS shows says we're developing this nanotech that's injected into you, hydrogels, this one part of it.
[02:03:41.373 --> 02:03:45.734]  And so when they give you the vaccine, it's got it, so it's little micro-crystals.
[02:03:45.734 --> 02:03:49.335]  It's so miniaturized, the chips now, it has record that you took the shot.
[02:03:49.335 --> 02:03:50.595]  That's the digital tattoos.
[02:03:50.595 --> 02:03:53.556]  But then Gates will come out and say, oh, it's not true, even though he's funding it.
[02:03:53.556 --> 02:03:55.797]  Look at this official social distancing sign.
[02:03:57.983 --> 02:03:58.683]  666.
[02:03:58.683 --> 02:04:00.444]  All that is is six degrees of separation.
[02:04:00.444 --> 02:04:02.545]  It's this mathematic code that we're all connected to each other.
[02:04:02.545 --> 02:04:02.865]  666.
[02:04:02.865 --> 02:04:05.407]  So they talk about Margaret the Beast.
[02:04:05.407 --> 02:04:08.308]  All of this is the same thing over and over again.
[02:04:08.308 --> 02:04:11.230]  The barcode operates off of 666.
[02:04:11.230 --> 02:04:12.550]  The computer codes are all 666.
[02:04:12.550 --> 02:04:20.295]  And so yes, and then Gates has patents where once you've had the vaccine, you have a digital tattoo
[02:04:21.295 --> 02:04:21.355]  So...
[02:04:49.352 --> 02:04:53.375]  So then what I did was, I read the Bible every single night, right?
[02:04:53.375 --> 02:04:59.339]  And I'm praying to God, and I'm getting right with God, like, you know, you say it all the time, get right with God.
[02:04:59.339 --> 02:05:03.302]  This is a time for everyone to be obeying God, diligently reading the Bible.
[02:05:03.302 --> 02:05:09.667]  So I was reading the Bible after I listened to that Larry Gators podcast, I think it was last night.
[02:05:10.393 --> 02:05:24.425]  And I just happen to be, I read a psalm every night, now I happen to be on psalm number 37, and psalm number 37 begins with, don't fret because of evildoers, for they will be cut down like the grass.
[02:05:24.425 --> 02:05:35.374]  And so, that really, that touched my spirit because I wasn't afraid, and I wasn't feeling like this need for me
[02:05:36.127 --> 02:05:36.608]  We're good to go.
[02:05:50.390 --> 02:05:54.131]  The Israelites were about to go off to war.
[02:05:54.131 --> 02:06:04.494]  God would go and fight the battle for them, like when the Egyptians were closing in, hailstones were coming down on them and the wagons, the wheels were coming off of the carts and stuff like that.
[02:06:04.494 --> 02:06:06.895]  God goes and fights the battles for us.
[02:06:06.895 --> 02:06:09.035]  That's something that we need to get in tune with.
[02:06:09.035 --> 02:06:11.236]  I know a lot of your audience is Christian.
[02:06:11.236 --> 02:06:15.917]  We need to start really getting in tune with the fact that God is going to go before us and fight this battle.
[02:06:15.917 --> 02:06:17.558]  We're not going to have to take this shot.
[02:06:18.038 --> 02:06:19.119]  From Bill Gates.
[02:06:19.119 --> 02:06:21.741]  We're not going to have to take this death shot.
[02:06:21.741 --> 02:06:23.622]  Trump is going to get re-elected.
[02:06:23.622 --> 02:06:25.584]  We're going to emerge victorious.
[02:06:25.584 --> 02:06:29.326]  And the wicked are going to perish like the grass.
[02:06:29.326 --> 02:06:32.428]  And you know, that was the message that I just wanted to convey today.
[02:06:32.428 --> 02:06:32.729]  All right.
[02:06:32.729 --> 02:06:33.749]  God bless you.
[02:06:33.749 --> 02:06:34.830]  And I hear what you're saying, Mike.
[02:06:34.830 --> 02:06:37.092]  But trust in God, Tiger Canmolar.
[02:06:37.092 --> 02:06:39.173]  Hunter S. Thompson, pray to God that we're away from the rocks.
[02:06:39.173 --> 02:06:39.614]  But I hear you.
[02:06:39.614 --> 02:06:41.855]  I think if we do the right thing, God will give us providence.
[02:06:41.855 --> 02:06:44.177]  Owens Troyer, Sven Hernandez, what do you think about the spiritual battle?
[02:06:45.831 --> 02:06:50.367]  Well, every time that, uh, we go out, it's like, uh, the script is on.
[02:06:50.367 --> 02:06:51.170]  Yeah, they turned it on now.
[02:06:51.170 --> 02:06:51.351]  Go ahead.
[02:06:52.503 --> 02:07:01.811]  Well, I think it's very apparent, the spiritual battle, when we go out and you just have a Trump hat on, or a Trump shirt or anything, or an InfoWars shirt, and it just triggers a reaction.
[02:07:01.811 --> 02:07:13.881]  Like, I went out in the armored truck today, and I wasn't saying anything controversial, really, I was just laying out facts about the Communist Chinese, and people just drive by and they just flick me off and they just say, F you.
[02:07:13.881 --> 02:07:16.003]  That's not a human thing.
[02:07:16.003 --> 02:07:17.965]  Well, when you would say USA, they would do it.
[02:07:18.505 --> 02:07:21.207]  Yeah, that's another triggering or an American flag.
[02:07:21.207 --> 02:07:28.471]  It's just all these triggering symbols that they've been taught are evil and they just have a programmed conditioned response.
[02:07:28.471 --> 02:07:29.611]  But that's not a human thing.
[02:07:29.611 --> 02:07:32.693]  It's not human to respond that way.
[02:07:32.693 --> 02:07:36.715]  It's not human to not be able to think for yourself and think logically and not be hateful.
[02:07:36.715 --> 02:07:38.056]  They really all act as one though.
[02:07:38.656 --> 02:08:03.007]  It is, it's a demonic frequency that they're all operating on, and the first initial reaction, driven by hate, is just, it's always violent, it's always vitriolic, and, uh, yeah, that's just one example why we, I mean, look, I don't, I'm not proud of the fact I have to go out and report news in an armored truck because I have people that come up and, you know, try to stab me, but, uh, that's, that's it, how it is, so, that's what we do now.
[02:08:03.007 --> 02:08:03.347]  Savannah?
[02:08:04.411 --> 02:08:12.803]  I completely agree Alex, I mean you can't even go out on the street without being attacked anymore and you call this a spiritual battle and I think that's exactly what this is.
[02:08:12.803 --> 02:08:19.493]  We're seeing degeneracy in the streets, we're seeing the LGBTQ whole entire initiative being pushed on children.
[02:08:19.873 --> 02:08:21.676]  Oh yeah, it's not about, oh let us get married.
[02:08:21.676 --> 02:08:23.298]  Now it's about, we're going to teach your kid.
[02:08:23.298 --> 02:08:23.778]  Exactly.
[02:08:23.778 --> 02:08:31.148]  We have Black Lives Matter painted across our town as well, our city as well, and we're constantly getting all of this stuff pushed in our faces.
[02:08:31.148 --> 02:08:34.612]  And notice the more we submit, then they want everything.
[02:08:34.612 --> 02:08:36.335]  Exactly, exactly Alex.
[02:08:36.335 --> 02:08:37.857]  Where do you think it's going?
[02:08:38.629 --> 02:08:39.889]  You know, Alex, I really don't know.
[02:08:39.889 --> 02:08:46.331]  I mean, I've been in politics now for, what, about two years, ever since I started working here and watching all of this unfold.
[02:08:46.331 --> 02:08:47.372]  I don't know where it's going.
[02:08:47.372 --> 02:08:58.515]  I'm really hoping that we've swung so far left that people start waking up and we go right again and people start realizing that we've come so far that we, you know, need to go back and that's what ends up happening.
[02:08:58.515 --> 02:09:00.316]  And you were hired to work just on the shows.
[02:09:00.316 --> 02:09:03.657]  You did a great job, but I wouldn't call it your radicalization, your education.
[02:09:03.657 --> 02:09:06.138]  Seeing it from the inside, we're not exaggerating.
[02:09:07.102 --> 02:09:09.544]  Exactly, and that's the thing too, Alex.
[02:09:09.544 --> 02:09:16.270]  I went out on the street and I actually experienced all of the things that you talk about on the show, and I actually saw them for myself.
[02:09:16.270 --> 02:09:25.619]  I don't like coming on air and talking about things that I haven't experienced, which is why I go out and I go and protest for police lives, which is why I've gone and talked to Antifa and BLM members.
[02:09:25.619 --> 02:09:30.804]  And when we say that these people are hateful, vitriolic, and degenerate, we're not exaggerating in the slightest.
[02:09:31.274 --> 02:09:33.496]  Well, why'd you have to make that girl cry like that?
[02:09:33.496 --> 02:09:34.477]  No, she hit you.
[02:09:34.477 --> 02:09:36.719]  All she did was attack you and assault you.
[02:09:36.719 --> 02:09:37.740]  Why'd you have to make her cry?
[02:09:37.740 --> 02:09:38.760]  And then it's LARPing, though.
[02:09:38.760 --> 02:09:39.121]  I'm a bad person.
[02:09:39.121 --> 02:09:40.762]  As soon as you hit her back, she starts crying.
[02:09:40.762 --> 02:09:41.283]  It's like, yeah.
[02:09:41.283 --> 02:09:43.865]  It's like when the antifa attacks somebody and they stab her.
[02:09:43.865 --> 02:09:45.706]  They're like, yeah, we fight back.
[02:09:45.706 --> 02:09:46.367]  Police!
[02:09:46.367 --> 02:09:47.648]  Oh, where are the police?
[02:09:47.648 --> 02:09:48.489]  Defund the police!
[02:09:48.489 --> 02:09:49.290]  I need the police!
[02:09:50.103 --> 02:09:57.306]  I'm really, really proud of the Dr. Jones Naturals activated charcoal, naturally fluoride-free mouthwash and toothpaste.
[02:09:57.306 --> 02:10:07.711]  And if you don't know what activated charcoal does, ladies and gentlemen, it naturally, in a clean way, strips away the toxins, the impurities, the plaque, and it doesn't damage the enamel.
[02:10:07.711 --> 02:10:08.871]  That's really important.

[02:10:34.401 --> 02:10:39.403]  Over a year ago, I tried Charcoal Toothpaste from a major brand and thought it was amazing.
[02:10:39.403 --> 02:10:44.085]  And I went to my dad and people said, I would like to put out a Charcoal Toothpaste that doesn't have all this silicate and all these fillers in it.
[02:10:44.085 --> 02:10:45.485]  Very strong toothpaste.

[02:11:53.694 --> 02:11:56.315]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:12:05.450 --> 02:12:11.441]  Alright, Owen Schroer and Savannah Hernandez here at Shotgun with Alex Jones, your host.
[02:12:11.441 --> 02:12:13.045]  And Owen has breaking news right now.
[02:12:13.939 --> 02:12:15.100]  That's right, Alex.
[02:12:15.100 --> 02:12:24.728]  The President of the United States, who they have once before called the Infowars President, has just tweeted out, Big news!
[02:12:24.728 --> 02:12:28.591]  The political crime of the century is unfolding.
[02:12:28.591 --> 02:12:34.535]  Obama-Biden illegally spied on the Trump campaign before and after the election.
[02:12:34.535 --> 02:12:35.536]  Treason!
[02:12:35.536 --> 02:12:40.941]  Yeah, that's the Sally Yates acting Attorney General at the time hearing.
[02:12:42.037 --> 02:12:44.118]  Where she's changing her story around a bunch.
[02:12:44.118 --> 02:12:50.282]  But if Durham and them don't act, or the Southern Texas Special Investigator, what does it matter?
[02:12:50.282 --> 02:12:57.406]  It's like Tucker Carlson says, this becomes like this theater of political porn, where we hear about it, ooh, two weeks, you know?
[02:12:57.406 --> 02:12:57.606]  I mean...
[02:12:58.106 --> 02:13:06.654]  Well, I hope that the President has a true desire and will to have justice come through here with the treason from Obama and the others.
[02:13:06.654 --> 02:13:10.417]  Maybe Durham doesn't, maybe Bill Barr doesn't, but I hope at least the President does.
[02:13:10.417 --> 02:13:12.579]  Well, there is some positive news.
[02:13:12.579 --> 02:13:15.181]  She threw Comey under the bus and said he went rogue.
[02:13:15.181 --> 02:13:18.324]  Well, and they're all going to end up throwing Obama under the bus if they haven't already.
[02:13:18.324 --> 02:13:22.308]  I'll tell you, the consolation prize is Obama looks really scared when I see him.
[02:13:22.308 --> 02:13:23.329]  Scandal-free President!
[02:13:23.809 --> 02:13:26.691]  The scandal-free president, they said.
[02:13:26.691 --> 02:13:28.532]  The scandal-free president.
[02:13:28.532 --> 02:13:31.473]  Yeah, not so much anymore.
[02:13:31.473 --> 02:13:32.134]  There he is.
[02:13:32.134 --> 02:13:35.355]  So where do you think all this is going?
[02:13:35.355 --> 02:13:44.741]  Well, I hope before the election, I expect that President Trump has a few October surprises up his sleeve.
[02:13:44.741 --> 02:13:52.045]  If he really is in this like he does his own business deals, and you can kind of read about it in the art of the deal, then
[02:13:53.001 --> 02:13:59.486]  He knows what they did to him in October of 2016 when they released the Billy Bush tape and they did some other shenanigans.
[02:14:00.506 --> 02:14:10.488]  I don't think President Trump had anything to do with Julian Assange, but Assange did come out with the WikiLeaks that showed Hillary Clinton and the Podestas do the spirit cooking, satanic stuff that they were involved in.
[02:14:10.488 --> 02:14:13.249]  So those were the two October surprises from 2016.
[02:14:13.249 --> 02:14:20.371]  Now that Trump has been involved in politics for four years, he's not dumb.
[02:14:20.371 --> 02:14:29.193]  He understands the October surprise, and my guess is he's going to have an October surprise of his own, and maybe that's, you know, we get to see Biden getting the perp walk.
[02:14:29.853 --> 02:14:33.354]  For illegally spying or for the Ukraine gate or for the China gate?
[02:14:33.354 --> 02:14:33.735]  I don't know.
[02:14:33.735 --> 02:14:37.136]  They're not going to arrest Biden during the middle of an election.
[02:14:37.136 --> 02:14:42.018]  Listen, they got plenty on the Chai Com angle, the Democrats being Chai Com agents.
[02:14:42.018 --> 02:14:46.280]  Because to get Chinese money, you've got to actually have a Chai Com in your office.
[02:14:46.280 --> 02:14:49.821]  So they can destroy them all for espionage with the Communist Chinese right now.
[02:14:49.821 --> 02:14:55.844]  The problem is so many Republicans were involved, to a lesser extent, but still involved, that they don't want to upset the apple cart.
[02:14:55.844 --> 02:14:57.624]  They want the Democrats to just give up, but they're not.
[02:14:57.624 --> 02:14:59.165]  Savannah, what do you think is going to happen in this election?
[02:15:00.489 --> 02:15:05.450]  Well, Alex, it's very interesting to see, too, that Joe Biden has been hiding for the past couple of months.
[02:15:05.450 --> 02:15:09.472]  They're now saying that there should be no debates between Joe Biden and President Trump.
[02:15:09.472 --> 02:15:18.294]  And, of course, the whole way that Joe Biden is going to win this election, or try to, is by hiding, is by staying out of plain sight, is by staying out of the news media.
[02:15:18.294 --> 02:15:26.497]  Because every single time he gets on air, he says something new and crazy, and people just realize more and more how much his mind has deteriorated.
[02:15:26.497 --> 02:15:30.078]  So, I mean, I don't see how Donald Trump could lose.
[02:15:30.719 --> 02:15:32.804]  Um, just because he's going up against Joe Biden.
[02:15:32.804 --> 02:15:37.275]  But I really don't know because, you know, back in 2016, everyone was saying the same thing about Donald Trump winning, so.
[02:15:38.277 --> 02:15:39.577]  No, they couldn't see how he's going to win.
[02:15:39.577 --> 02:15:43.719]  Well, clearly he's a placeholder, and they'll probably try to remove him or something.
[02:15:43.719 --> 02:15:46.980]  They wanted to do it once he got in office, but now they know he's deteriorating too fast.
[02:15:46.980 --> 02:15:51.521]  He could probably die, and they'd just say, well, he's in hiding as a terrorist, he can't come out or something.
[02:15:51.521 --> 02:16:02.705]  I mean, we're about to see spectacular garbage, because everything the New World Order's done is failing right now, but they still have the power of the media and the purse, so they think they can get away with it.
[02:16:02.705 --> 02:16:04.526]  So this is spectacularly dangerous.
[02:16:05.353 --> 02:16:09.338]  Yeah, the fake pandemic isn't going over how they wanted it to.
[02:16:09.338 --> 02:16:14.904]  Their fake hate crimes of Jussie Smollett and Bubba Wallace both failed.
[02:16:14.904 --> 02:16:24.675]  It's not going to reach enough eyes, but the George Floyd arrest has been made public and people are going to see, wow, the media lied about that too.
[02:16:24.855 --> 02:16:37.162]  And you know what, Owen, can I just jump in real quick because the body cam footage did come out for George Floyd yesterday and we have a local BLM leader, his name is King here, and he's the one where I always go to his events and somehow get attacked.
[02:16:37.162 --> 02:16:44.226]  He actually talked with Steven Crowder yesterday, but he came up to me and he was asking me about George Floyd and I said, well, did you watch the body cam footage?
[02:16:44.226 --> 02:16:45.946]  And he said, what body cam footage?
[02:16:45.946 --> 02:16:47.287]  And I was like, it was released today.
[02:16:47.287 --> 02:16:49.528]  George Floyd himself asked to lie on the ground.
[02:16:49.528 --> 02:16:50.349]  He didn't believe me.
[02:16:50.989 --> 02:16:55.372]  And three other people around me said, George Floyd did not ask to be put on the ground.
[02:16:55.372 --> 02:16:56.592]  George Floyd was not on drugs.
[02:16:56.592 --> 02:16:57.873]  It's very sad.
[02:16:57.873 --> 02:17:02.936]  He's bombed out of his brain saying, I can't breathe, I'm dying in the back of the car.
[02:17:02.936 --> 02:17:09.579]  So we have the evidence now, Alex, about this George Floyd case to completely debunk everything that BLM has been marching for.
[02:17:09.579 --> 02:17:14.162]  But these BLM leaders are so set in their way that they refuse to even watch this body cam footage.
[02:17:14.162 --> 02:17:16.903]  They refuse to even educate themselves on what actually happened.
[02:17:16.903 --> 02:17:19.146]  Yeah, but see, here's why they get so mad.
[02:17:19.146 --> 02:17:23.993]  It's a psychological, uh, just defense mechanism that they have where...
[02:17:25.197 --> 02:17:27.258]  Imagine a guinea pig in a cage.
[02:17:27.258 --> 02:17:31.720]  The only thing a guinea pig is ever going to eat in that cage is whatever you feed him.
[02:17:31.720 --> 02:17:36.823]  So you could be having a big filet mignon dinner and then you give him a little scrap of, you know, cilantro on the top or something.
[02:17:36.823 --> 02:17:38.423]  And so that's all the guinea pig gets.
[02:17:38.423 --> 02:17:44.566]  These BLM people, these Antifa people, are guinea pigs in the cage of the fake news.
[02:17:44.566 --> 02:17:46.367]  So they're only going to get what they're given.
[02:17:46.367 --> 02:17:48.688]  They never saw the George Floyd tape.
[02:17:48.688 --> 02:17:50.009]  They'll never see the George Floyd tape.
[02:17:50.009 --> 02:17:50.809]  But it's worse than that.
[02:17:50.809 --> 02:17:51.730]  They want to be delusional.
[02:17:52.290 --> 02:17:53.472]  But it's a defense mechanism.
[02:17:53.472 --> 02:17:55.314]  They don't want to know they've been fooled.
[02:17:55.314 --> 02:17:57.056]  They don't want to know they've been tricked.
[02:17:57.056 --> 02:17:59.759]  They don't want to think that they're still the slaves.
[02:17:59.759 --> 02:18:03.344]  And so they just have a defense mechanism to deny all the evidence.
[02:18:03.344 --> 02:18:07.048]  Which, by the way, this was going on when Harriet Tubman was doing the Underground Railroad as well.
[02:18:07.048 --> 02:18:08.330]  I mean, she wrote about this.
[02:18:08.330 --> 02:18:09.131]  But here's the problem.
[02:18:10.247 --> 02:18:20.312]  We talk about the dumb minions all day long, and the same BLM guy at Steven Crowder's video that you shot, where he goes, well, your information is hurtful, so I'm not going to allow you to have speech.
[02:18:20.312 --> 02:18:24.895]  Crowder's out there trying to have his interviews and get people disagreeing with him.
[02:18:24.895 --> 02:18:27.216]  He goes, no, I'm not letting a discourse happen.
[02:18:27.216 --> 02:18:27.817]  That's good.
[02:18:27.817 --> 02:18:29.257]  No, that's authoritarian.
[02:18:29.257 --> 02:18:30.018]  That's what's dangerous.
[02:18:30.717 --> 02:18:31.357]  Exactly.
[02:18:31.357 --> 02:18:38.122]  And again, Antifa, the Antifa members and the people in their group are the biggest fascists in this country.
[02:18:38.122 --> 02:18:40.623]  They're, again, like you said, Alex, they're authoritarian.
[02:18:40.623 --> 02:18:42.324]  They try to shut down free speech.
[02:18:42.324 --> 02:18:45.546]  They try to shut down our ability to go and protest ourselves.
[02:18:45.546 --> 02:18:47.347]  That's, I mean, that's all these people do.
[02:18:47.347 --> 02:18:48.688]  They don't want freedom of speech.
[02:18:48.688 --> 02:18:50.029]  They don't want this to be America.
[02:18:50.029 --> 02:18:51.550]  They want this to be communist China.
[02:18:51.550 --> 02:18:52.730]  We've seen that again and again.
[02:18:52.730 --> 02:19:00.135]  I actually have an inside person at these protests who was telling me that the Maoist organization here in Austin, Texas has been circulating my photos around.
[02:19:00.495 --> 02:19:07.046]  Because they want everyone to know who I am so they can come and silence me at protests or silence me from reporting from now on.
[02:19:07.046 --> 02:19:08.769]  These are un-American dangerous scum.
[02:19:09.520 --> 02:19:17.667]  Yeah, and you know, as well, there's another organization called Peace in Austin, and I just did another report you can find on Action 7 about them.
[02:19:17.667 --> 02:19:18.889]  They're called Peace in Austin.
[02:19:18.889 --> 02:19:20.090]  They're an Antifa group.
[02:19:20.090 --> 02:19:21.551]  They're trying to make spike strips.
[02:19:21.551 --> 02:19:25.615]  They had a building and supply drive the other day that I went to.
[02:19:25.615 --> 02:19:36.685]  They're trying to make spike strips, they're trying to make riot shields, they're trying to make all these dangerous weapons, and again, they're trying to disguise themselves as Peace in Austin, when again, that's not what they are at all.
[02:19:37.708 --> 02:19:43.013]  Well, and just like Soros funded Ukraine, earlier caller Carlos talked about that.
[02:19:43.013 --> 02:19:45.275]  They had snipers on roofs shooting people.
[02:19:45.275 --> 02:19:48.978]  And so now they're saying their next move, Antifa, is to do that.
[02:19:48.978 --> 02:19:58.647]  And our acquiescence, our bowing down the big corporations, our bowing down the shycoms, our bowing down the left, and letting them take over the universities has elicited this.
[02:19:58.647 --> 02:20:00.929]  Our acquiescence has done this.
[02:20:00.929 --> 02:20:02.590]  40 seconds to break, come back with calls.
[02:20:02.590 --> 02:20:04.592]  What do we do, Owen, to stop bowing down?
[02:20:05.745 --> 02:20:14.408]  Well here's what local leadership and law enforcement needs to understand, is that exact paradigm, it applies to how they handle Antifa.
[02:20:14.408 --> 02:20:17.449]  Yeah the police bowed down to BLM and that only made it worse.
[02:20:17.449 --> 02:20:22.371]  And so, and so, but if you were a conservative or something, you got out, you got harassed for not having masks.
[02:20:22.791 --> 02:20:30.819]  Or you had people arrested for opening the businesses, but if you have a BLM protest, and you burn and loot, and the police are told to stand down, then guess what?
[02:20:30.819 --> 02:20:36.244]  They keep coming back, they keep trying to get riled up, they keep getting worse, and then it doesn't even matter what happened to George Floyd.
[02:20:36.244 --> 02:20:37.805]  It never mattered what happened to George Floyd.
[02:20:37.805 --> 02:20:43.551]  You allowed them to behave like that in the outset, and so now they just assume that's what they can do whenever they want.
[02:20:43.551 --> 02:20:43.951]  That's right.
[02:20:43.951 --> 02:20:45.473]  We'll be back with calls and a lot more.
[02:20:45.473 --> 02:20:45.833]  Stay with us.
[02:20:48.416 --> 02:20:53.260]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[02:20:53.260 --> 02:21:02.186]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients, and stress, you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals needed daily.
[02:21:02.186 --> 02:21:07.530]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula.

[02:21:48.722 --> 02:22:04.577]  We are selling more privacy pockets a day than we were previously selling in a month because of the Clinton Foundation running the contact tracing and admittedly with Google and Apple tracking all Americans on their phones even if you hopped out of it or get rid of the apps.
[02:22:04.577 --> 02:22:10.923]  People realize these criminal groups are surveilling you and selling your data and using it to control your life.
[02:22:11.483 --> 02:22:11.904]  We're good.
[02:22:28.266 --> 02:22:28.947]  Human freedom.
[02:22:28.947 --> 02:22:29.907]  The wild, wild west.
[02:22:29.907 --> 02:22:30.347]  The renaissance.
[02:22:30.347 --> 02:22:30.768]  America.
[02:22:30.768 --> 02:22:31.308]  Human liberty.
[02:22:59.335 --> 02:23:07.382]  The West built all the freedom, all the choices, all the empowerment we see.
[02:23:07.382 --> 02:23:13.748]  The general population has been programmed that submission to tyranny brings them prosperity.
[02:23:13.748 --> 02:23:25.258]  Because the last 50 years under psychotic globalist control, they have taught us by successive approximation to bow down and each time be given a reward, a treat.
[02:23:26.374 --> 02:23:35.661]  That's like training wild pigs to come eat out of your hand and finally one day you lead them into the barn and close the door and butcher them.
[02:23:35.661 --> 02:23:42.086]  We're now reaching that point in societal development where submission is death.
[02:23:42.086 --> 02:23:51.212]  Where submission is the human species being destroyed forever on the altar of Satan.
[02:23:51.212 --> 02:23:53.894]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:24:09.415 --> 02:24:13.436]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:24:13.436 --> 02:24:16.336]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:24:16.336 --> 02:24:28.178]  You know, I'm gonna butcher this and try to make it quick so I get the calls and get the commentary from Savannah Hernandez and Owen Schroyer who host the War Room coming up at three o'clock central today after John Rappaport comes up in the next hour.
[02:24:28.178 --> 02:24:36.580]  I want to get to some of these callers that have been patiently holding like Joe and Wilde and Nicholas and a few of the others there that have just been calling in Jefferson, Chase and others.
[02:24:38.288 --> 02:24:48.550]  We study how British Navy brought in opium out of India and out of Afghanistan and got the Chinese ports corrupted.
[02:24:48.550 --> 02:24:54.752]  China made it illegal and then over about a hundred years they took over China and they broke China up into different zones.
[02:24:54.752 --> 02:24:59.453]  The French would occupy one, the Americans another, the Dutch another, the British another.
[02:25:00.916 --> 02:25:05.340]  And the Chinese government admits, oh, we're doing it back to you because you did it to us.
[02:25:05.340 --> 02:25:07.222]  That's why they ship the fentanyl in or whatever.
[02:25:07.222 --> 02:25:13.927]  But when you see the homeless all laid out, drugged out, and you see the hundreds of thousands of deaths from it a year, I mean, that's what's happening to America.
[02:25:13.927 --> 02:25:14.988]  But it's bigger than that.
[02:25:14.988 --> 02:25:16.610]  They have cell phones.
[02:25:16.610 --> 02:25:24.977]  So the homeless can sit there and grill, lay out, do whatever, get all their welfare money that the Democrats manage for them and take a slice of.
[02:25:24.977 --> 02:25:26.699]  And so people are just opting out.
[02:25:28.106 --> 02:25:40.057]  And then becoming this political tool, this political weapon, and it really just shows you the paradox of an open, free, wealthy society creates these spoiled brats that don't want to do anything.
[02:25:40.057 --> 02:25:46.342]  And America does use more drugs than any other country in the world, and I just wonder, as such a selfless nation, are we even meant to survive?
[02:25:46.342 --> 02:25:49.005]  Do you want to comment on that, Savannah?
[02:25:50.367 --> 02:26:08.519]  Alex, like I said, I've just been sitting back and watching all of this, but the destruction of America that has happened just over the past couple of years watching this has been so sad to see, and I hope that we can come back from it, and you know, like you said, we're so selfish, we deserve to be in this spot, and I mean, I really, I don't know.
[02:26:08.519 --> 02:26:08.760]  Owen?
[02:26:09.684 --> 02:26:21.613]  Well, the NBA players are the kind of epitome, I think, of this, where an NBA athlete makes more money than any other athlete on the planet per average salary.
[02:26:21.613 --> 02:26:26.016]  Now, that's because there's, you know, maybe only 12 guys on the team, but they're making on average about $5 million a year.
[02:26:26.016 --> 02:26:30.940]  That's for the worst player, the bench guy, who doesn't even step on the floor once all season.
[02:26:30.940 --> 02:26:33.461]  He's making millions of dollars.
[02:26:33.461 --> 02:26:34.923]  And then they're all going to take a knee
[02:26:35.916 --> 02:26:49.359]  When if they could have filled arenas, aside from, you know, the Spike Lees or whoever who can afford the courtside seats every night, the combined wealth of the entire audience probably wouldn't equal one of these players.
[02:26:50.253 --> 02:27:05.159]  And then they're going to take a knee in the National Anthem and pretend to be oppressed and tell Americans to feel oppressed as you have millionaire black athletes and millionaire black entertainers who all make money in this supposed white supremacist society.
[02:27:05.159 --> 02:27:09.741]  They've loaded their bank accounts with tens of millions of dollars and then we're just supposed to accept it.
[02:27:10.521 --> 02:27:15.125]  And then when you actually, if you wanted to be like, huh, okay, Black Lives Matter, what is this about?
[02:27:15.125 --> 02:27:16.185]  Hmm, sounds kind of good.
[02:27:16.185 --> 02:27:18.427]  And then you actually do the research, like Marcellus Wiley.
[02:27:18.427 --> 02:27:21.750]  We're going to get rid of the family and communism is the way to go.
[02:27:21.750 --> 02:27:25.353]  Yeah, like Marcellus Wiley did, Fox Sports.
[02:27:26.417 --> 02:27:27.298]  I never played that clip.
[02:27:27.298 --> 02:27:28.239]  That was really powerful.
[02:27:28.239 --> 02:27:29.200]  What's the name of that clip?
[02:27:48.701 --> 02:27:49.921]  It's Marcellus Wiley.
[02:27:49.921 --> 02:27:52.562]  He's on, uh... Marcellus... NBA TV or whatever.
[02:27:52.562 --> 02:27:53.443]  It's Fox Sports 1.
[02:27:53.443 --> 02:27:54.343]  I don't know what the name of the show is.
[02:27:54.343 --> 02:27:54.763]  Fox Sports, yeah.
[02:27:54.763 --> 02:27:55.964]  Say it again, and they'll pull it up.
[02:27:55.964 --> 02:27:57.324]  Talks about Black Lives Matter.
[02:27:57.324 --> 02:27:57.704]  What was it?
[02:27:57.704 --> 02:28:00.985]  Yeah, it's Marcellus Wiley... Destroys Black Lives Matter.
[02:28:00.985 --> 02:28:02.806]  Yeah, there's the, uh... Yeah, get that for next time.
[02:28:02.806 --> 02:28:03.606]  It's only a few minutes.
[02:28:03.606 --> 02:28:05.187]  I want to go to a few calls here, but you're absolutely right.
[02:28:05.447 --> 02:28:06.327]  Well, but here's the thing, Alex.
[02:28:06.327 --> 02:28:06.988]  You gotta understand.
[02:28:06.988 --> 02:28:10.609]  He's on Fox Sports 1, which is kind of like an up-and-coming sports station.
[02:28:10.609 --> 02:28:13.030]  It's been around for maybe 10 years now.
[02:28:13.030 --> 02:28:14.991]  You wouldn't be allowed to say that on SportsCenter.
[02:28:14.991 --> 02:28:17.412]  Oh, but ESPN, I read the transcripts.
[02:28:17.412 --> 02:28:20.714]  It is like, America sucks, China's good.
[02:28:20.714 --> 02:28:21.034]  In fact,
[02:28:21.294 --> 02:28:41.956]  Just the other day, I covered this on the War Room yesterday, you guys may be able to find the tweet, but SportsCenter, which is ESPN's top tier show, SportsCenter put out a tweet, and they always do this now, you can look it up, and they have Black Lives Matter capitalized every time, Black Lives Matter capitalized, and they never capitalize the National Anthem.
[02:28:42.276 --> 02:28:56.427]  So, so, they're literally putting these... Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[02:29:12.335 --> 02:29:12.975]  Definitely, Alex.
[02:29:12.975 --> 02:29:20.180]  And you know, we talked about, too, the NBA players and China infiltrating just all of these organizations.
[02:29:20.180 --> 02:29:22.162]  And Alex, I mean, that's exactly it.
[02:29:22.162 --> 02:29:27.966]  And I'm sorry, you know, this morning was so long, so I'm kind of blank today, but... You are not blank!
[02:29:28.326 --> 02:29:33.770]  I'm a little bit, I'm a little bit blank today Alex, but you know... You were out there yesterday covering Steven Crowder and today.
[02:29:33.770 --> 02:29:48.182]  Yes, we were out there yesterday and then today just covering all of this BLM nonsense here in the city of Austin and it's just been so disheartening to watch and see and I really hope and pray for our country every single day because people have just strayed so far from the traditional family
[02:29:48.742 --> 02:29:53.024]  From religion, from God, we've allowed China to overtake our country.
[02:29:53.024 --> 02:29:59.647]  And like you said, too, you know, people are distracted right now by Uncle Ben and Aunt Jemimiah because it's cultural appropriation.
[02:29:59.647 --> 02:30:01.787]  It's bad, you know, they use a black person.
[02:30:01.787 --> 02:30:07.910]  But they're completely distracted from the fact that, like you said, there's still concentration camps in China.
[02:30:07.910 --> 02:30:09.591]  China is overtaking Hong Kong.
[02:30:09.591 --> 02:30:12.012]  People who are actually fighting for democracy over there.
[02:30:12.012 --> 02:30:12.812]  That's right, you went to Hong Kong.
[02:30:13.973 --> 02:30:27.780]  Yes, you sent me over there and when I talk to those people, they love Donald Trump, they love America because they truly understand what it means to be oppressed, to have their freedoms taken away, to have their freedom of speech taken away, to experience police brutality.
[02:30:27.780 --> 02:30:37.665]  The people here in America have it easy compared to the people in Hong Kong because they're fighting against China, this oppressive regime which is trying to enslave people that disappears people in the street.
[02:30:37.665 --> 02:30:40.567]  The people in Portland are acting like that's what's happening to them.
[02:30:40.987 --> 02:30:41.707]  Okay, it's not.
[02:30:41.707 --> 02:30:47.550]  They have no idea what it really means to be oppressed by authoritarianism, like the people in Hong Kong do.
[02:30:47.550 --> 02:30:51.532]  But see, but that's why this is such a, just, offensive joke.
[02:30:51.532 --> 02:31:10.382]  Because they act like they're social justice warriors, they act like they're fighting the good fight, and then, but if you try to actually engage in linear logic and just follow down a thought pattern, it's like, okay, well, again, China, which controls the NBA, controls most of your television, controls most of the internet you see, controls Hollywood, I mean,
[02:31:10.822 --> 02:31:12.683]  China's controlling all of this stuff.
[02:31:12.683 --> 02:31:14.883]  They're the ones with the slave labor camps.
[02:31:14.883 --> 02:31:17.124]  They're the one with the child labor force.
[02:31:17.124 --> 02:31:18.965]  They're the one with the dissident camps.
[02:31:18.965 --> 02:31:20.965]  That's not in America at all.
[02:31:20.965 --> 02:31:23.186]  So it's just like China's literally behind all of it.
[02:31:23.186 --> 02:31:24.907]  It's like, Alex, I was telling you this during the break.
[02:31:24.907 --> 02:31:28.888]  I'm sitting in front of the Google headquarters in the Infowars armored truck.
[02:31:29.858 --> 02:31:30.778]  Because they don't care.
[02:31:30.778 --> 02:31:32.619]  They think they're part of the establishment.
[02:31:57.865 --> 02:31:58.285]  I mean, I guess.
[02:31:58.285 --> 02:32:00.707]  They just follow that we're the good guys, you're the bad guys.
[02:32:00.707 --> 02:32:03.648]  And it's just some weird power trip where it's like, oh, I feel good.
[02:32:03.648 --> 02:32:05.810]  I just flicked off a conservative.
[02:32:05.810 --> 02:32:07.831]  I just flicked off a Trump supporter.
[02:32:07.831 --> 02:32:09.832]  I'm fighting the good fight.
[02:32:09.832 --> 02:32:15.035]  It's like, no, you're a clown in a face mask, breathing in your own toxic fumes like a slave.
[02:32:15.035 --> 02:32:15.315]  No, I agree.
[02:32:15.315 --> 02:32:16.736]  So then you said, you're blank.
[02:32:16.736 --> 02:32:17.857]  Well, I didn't really ask you a question.
[02:32:17.857 --> 02:32:19.437]  I said, what do you think of the NBA corruption?
[02:32:19.437 --> 02:32:21.899]  You had a great, great breakdown of what's happening.
[02:32:23.280 --> 02:32:29.383]  It's hurting the NBA, it's hurting the NFL, it's hurting all these groups that do this, but still they do it because they're bought and paid for.
[02:32:29.383 --> 02:32:31.404]  There's an agenda in this country.
[02:32:31.404 --> 02:32:36.746]  Right, and I mean, like you said too, all of their ratings completely crashed after they came out in protest.
[02:32:36.746 --> 02:32:41.749]  And then again too, who was the one NBA player who has made headlines, who has made big waves?
[02:32:41.749 --> 02:32:44.130]  It was the one NBA player, I don't know his name, but he was the one.
[02:32:44.130 --> 02:32:46.431]  And then he hurt his knee and they celebrated that.
[02:32:46.431 --> 02:32:47.191]  Yeah, Jonathan Isaac.
[02:32:47.191 --> 02:32:50.153]  Jonathan Isaac and his jerseys went to like top sales.
[02:32:50.153 --> 02:32:50.733]  Yeah, and why is that?
[02:32:50.733 --> 02:32:52.374]  And then he hurt his knee and they said, you deserve it.
[02:32:54.341 --> 02:32:55.502]  And why did he make top sales?
[02:32:55.502 --> 02:32:57.003]  Why was he making headlines in ways?
[02:32:57.003 --> 02:32:59.465]  Because he stood up for America.
[02:32:59.465 --> 02:33:06.411]  And I think it was, I can't remember, but back in the, a while back, it was during the Olympics.
[02:33:06.411 --> 02:33:07.792]  He was a wrestler.
[02:33:07.792 --> 02:33:11.615]  He held up the American flag and he waved it and then everyone was demonizing him for it.
[02:33:11.615 --> 02:33:15.058]  And he was like, I didn't know that standing up for America and waving an American flag
[02:33:15.538 --> 02:33:17.439]  Would be a political statement.
[02:33:17.439 --> 02:33:18.859]  And we've gotten to that point now.
[02:33:18.859 --> 02:33:20.900]  Yeah, because they're getting rid of the country, folks.
[02:33:20.900 --> 02:33:21.640]  It's here.
[02:33:21.640 --> 02:33:22.961]  And that means everything.
[02:33:22.961 --> 02:33:26.582]  And that means replacing it with global government contact tracers.
[02:33:26.582 --> 02:33:27.702]  World ID.
[02:33:27.702 --> 02:33:29.563]  This is the rollout of the World ID.
[02:33:29.563 --> 02:33:30.743]  They plan to collapse America.
[02:33:30.743 --> 02:33:31.624]  They plan to bring it down.
[02:33:31.624 --> 02:33:34.224]  All right, I promise, when we come back, they've been troopers.
[02:33:34.224 --> 02:33:36.665]  Nicholas, Wilde, Joe.
[02:33:36.665 --> 02:33:37.446]  They are awesome.
[02:33:37.446 --> 02:33:38.326]  And y'all get free t-shirts.
[02:33:38.326 --> 02:33:39.566]  Get your address.
[02:33:39.566 --> 02:33:40.507]  We're gonna go to you too, though.
[02:33:40.507 --> 02:33:42.127]  And then Jefferson and Jeff.
[02:33:42.127 --> 02:33:42.627]  Stay with us.
[02:33:42.627 --> 02:33:43.268]  We'll be right back.

[02:34:43.660 --> 02:34:45.982]  Other systems, just don't compare.
[02:34:49.462 --> 02:34:55.723]  Twenty-four years ago, I began to get calls from major Hollywood directors, producers, actors.
[02:34:55.723 --> 02:34:56.923]  They wanted to meet with me.
[02:34:56.923 --> 02:34:59.344]  And they said, what is your formal education?
[02:34:59.344 --> 02:35:01.484]  And I said, well, really, nothing but a few years of college.
[02:35:01.484 --> 02:35:08.106]  They said, well, how are you one of the best science fiction or cultural writers we've ever heard?
[02:35:08.106 --> 02:35:11.886]  The stuff you come up with is just unbelievable.
[02:35:11.886 --> 02:35:12.906]  We'd like you to be in movies.
[02:35:12.906 --> 02:35:14.147]  We'd like you to write with us.
[02:35:14.147 --> 02:35:15.607]  We'd like you to do voiceovers.
[02:35:16.087 --> 02:35:17.227]  You're just a renaissance man.
[02:35:17.227 --> 02:35:20.908]  And folks know I was in some movies and Harry Shearer makes statements like that and a lot of others.
[02:35:20.908 --> 02:35:21.588]  I'm not bragging.
[02:35:21.588 --> 02:35:27.309]  And I kept explaining to them, I said, do you understand I didn't come up with any of this?
[02:35:27.309 --> 02:35:32.250]  I'm reading globalist MIT white papers and futurist documents.
[02:35:32.250 --> 02:35:34.570]  And they would just laugh at me and say, oh, no way.
[02:35:34.570 --> 02:35:36.370]  Then I would give them the documents.
[02:35:36.370 --> 02:35:40.851]  They would get very, very scared the next time I saw them in a few months and say, man, you're right.
[02:35:40.851 --> 02:35:42.031]  This is dystopic.
[02:35:42.031 --> 02:35:44.752]  Folks, I didn't make any of this up, OK?
[02:35:44.752 --> 02:35:45.392]  It's real.
[02:35:45.392 --> 02:35:45.812]  It's real.
[02:35:47.654 --> 02:36:02.252]  The BBC is state-run media in the UK and they've come out with a detailed article that's linked on Infowars.com saying you will have to have forced inoculations multiple times a year to be able to travel.
[02:36:02.252 --> 02:36:04.535]  Robots will scan you when you land.
[02:36:04.535 --> 02:36:06.817]  You will have a digital tattoo under your skin.
[02:36:07.578 --> 02:36:11.983]  To be able to enter the country, but it's going to be so easy and so cool and so fun.
[02:36:11.983 --> 02:36:16.027]  The Microsoft website now officially has announced the digital tattoo.
[02:36:16.027 --> 02:36:17.608]  We exposed this six months ago.
[02:36:17.608 --> 02:36:22.613]  Now Bill Gates was funding it and they had hundreds of news articles attacking us saying it wasn't true.
[02:36:22.613 --> 02:36:23.935]  This is a tactic they used.
[02:36:24.255 --> 02:36:25.215]  First, they announce it.
[02:36:25.215 --> 02:36:26.296]  We say it's a bad idea.
[02:36:26.296 --> 02:36:27.176]  They say, that's crazy.
[02:36:27.176 --> 02:36:28.356]  We didn't do it.
[02:36:28.356 --> 02:36:29.537]  They introduce the idea to you.
[02:36:29.537 --> 02:36:33.078]  Then they come back and announce it again, thinking you have no memory.
[02:36:33.078 --> 02:36:35.358]  This is a criminal takeover.
[02:36:35.358 --> 02:36:37.479]  This is the line in the sand.
[02:36:37.479 --> 02:36:38.699]  We must say no.
[02:36:38.699 --> 02:36:43.601]  We must expose the fraud of COVID-19 that this entire house of evil is built on.
[02:36:43.601 --> 02:36:44.481]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:36:44.481 --> 02:36:45.642]  Never surrender to tyranny.
[02:36:45.642 --> 02:36:46.302]  Infowars.com.
[02:36:47.936 --> 02:36:55.284]  Snowden and others taught us how mobile phones are constantly spying on us.
[02:36:55.284 --> 02:37:02.152]  Not just tracking and recording our GPS location, but recording audio and video as well.
[02:37:02.152 --> 02:37:03.793]  With or without a battery.
[02:37:04.574 --> 02:37:10.662]  Now, with the InfoWars Privacy Pouch, you can go dark wherever you choose.
[02:37:10.662 --> 02:37:11.524]  Excellent.

[02:37:21.717 --> 02:37:32.483]  Government agencies, identity thieves, tech giants, and now contact tracers are all tracking your every move through your mobile phone.

[02:37:51.185 --> 02:37:53.803]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:38:04.867 --> 02:38:12.013]  Alright, I'm going to host a little bit in the next hour, then John Redford's taking over, but Marcellus Wiley was on fire almost a month ago now, and I never played it.
[02:38:12.013 --> 02:38:14.575]  I'm glad that Owen Troyer, coming up with a war room at 3 p.m.
[02:38:14.575 --> 02:38:16.476]  today, who's riding shotgun with us, brought that up.
[02:38:16.476 --> 02:38:22.161]  We'll play that at the start of the next hour, but right now, you have been holding as true troopers, as great Americans.
[02:38:22.161 --> 02:38:25.123]  I want to thank Nicholas Wilde and Joe for holding.
[02:38:25.123 --> 02:38:28.145]  So let's go ahead and go to Nicholas in New Jersey.
[02:38:28.145 --> 02:38:28.646]  You're on the air.
[02:38:28.646 --> 02:38:28.906]  Thank you.
[02:38:31.192 --> 02:38:35.386]  Hey Alex, I had an InfoWars product question before my actual question.
[02:38:35.386 --> 02:38:35.948]  Yes sir, go ahead.
[02:38:37.208 --> 02:38:44.635]  I was just wondering if you guys have like an adrenal support supplement, you know, because America has adrenal fatigue really bad, like overall.
[02:38:44.635 --> 02:38:45.776]  Believe me, I've got it.
[02:38:45.776 --> 02:38:47.377]  I finally hit the wall, man.
[02:38:47.377 --> 02:38:48.318]  Even the supplements help me.
[02:38:48.318 --> 02:38:49.899]  I've got to remember to take them all.
[02:38:49.899 --> 02:38:51.641]  DNA Force cleans out your cells.
[02:38:51.641 --> 02:38:54.043]  It supports adrenal support.
[02:38:54.043 --> 02:38:55.764]  X2 does it.
[02:38:55.764 --> 02:38:57.346]  I mean, basically, selenium does it.
[02:38:57.346 --> 02:38:57.826]  You've got to know.
[02:38:57.826 --> 02:39:01.830]  In fact, I'm the one that forgets to take my vitamins and then I get tired like I am today.
[02:39:01.830 --> 02:39:02.510]  But I would take...
[02:39:04.400 --> 02:39:06.941]  I would take the X2 or the X3.
[02:39:06.941 --> 02:39:12.282]  I would take vitamin B12, Ultra 12.
[02:39:12.282 --> 02:39:23.106]  I mean, those are all the things that are the baseline, so that no matter how much caffeine you get, it doesn't work anymore if you don't have the vitamin D3, you don't have the vitamin B12, you don't have... I mean, obviously, you can take Turbo Force.
[02:39:24.087 --> 02:39:29.009]  But that's not supporting the adrenals itself, it's ordering them to pump more stuff out.
[02:39:29.009 --> 02:39:30.730]  But it works really great.
[02:39:30.730 --> 02:39:33.131]  So that's a really, really good question.
[02:39:33.131 --> 02:39:37.113]  I would say that... I'd say it's the one I mentioned.
[02:39:37.113 --> 02:39:38.794]  What do you think, Owen?
[02:39:38.794 --> 02:39:40.634]  Yeah, that's an interesting point you make about the turbo force.
[02:39:40.634 --> 02:39:45.577]  I was wondering why I get like 10 to 13 hours of energy when I drink the turbo force.
[02:39:45.577 --> 02:39:48.978]  I guess it makes sense because I'm loaded up on the vitamin B's and C's and everything else.
[02:39:48.978 --> 02:39:49.959]  No, no, it's in there too.
[02:39:49.959 --> 02:39:50.739]  That's why it helps some.
[02:39:50.739 --> 02:39:52.560]  But it's still ordering your body to produce the...
[02:39:53.370 --> 02:40:01.502]  Yeah, I think definitely the nascent iodine just to kind of kick everything into gear just on the outset.
[02:40:01.502 --> 02:40:03.645]  There's so many great things in the DNA Force Plus.
[02:40:03.645 --> 02:40:05.908]  Yeah, Owen was bald until he took it.
[02:40:05.908 --> 02:40:07.550]  Now he's got that Elvis hair.
[02:40:07.550 --> 02:40:08.372]  I'm joking, folks.
[02:40:10.184 --> 02:40:12.585]  If you want the hair, Bio PCA.
[02:40:12.585 --> 02:40:15.967]  The Bio 10 and the Bio PCA is good for your hair.
[02:40:15.967 --> 02:40:26.813]  But you know, for adrenal sport, honestly, if you're a man or even a woman, I mean, super male vitality has so many things that are just going to, at the very least, give you that same kind of drive and energy every day.
[02:40:26.813 --> 02:40:33.837]  If I had to recommend one thing, I'd say DNA Force Plus, because it's got the PQQ, the CoQ10, and a bunch of other things that go in and clean out the cells.
[02:40:33.837 --> 02:40:35.678]  And I'm saying all this and remembering that
[02:40:36.988 --> 02:40:39.611]  A week ago I cleaned off the desk here.
[02:40:39.611 --> 02:40:42.474]  It's dirty again by all my little things here.
[02:40:42.474 --> 02:40:46.698]  And I need to put them back on because I forget to take them myself.
[02:40:46.698 --> 02:40:48.721]  But does that answer your question, Nicholas?
[02:40:49.713 --> 02:40:52.074]  No, no, but I wanted to ask a real question.
[02:40:52.074 --> 02:41:01.097]  You know, after that, I was just saying, you know, just for the adrenal thing, because I, you know, I would like to support, so, I mean, the adrenal support thing, because, you know... Yeah, some products out there are called adrenal support.
[02:41:01.097 --> 02:41:02.517]  Other companies have.
[02:41:02.517 --> 02:41:05.498]  All the stuff we put out, one way or another, supports your adrenals.
[02:41:05.498 --> 02:41:08.980]  I mean, I would say that, I would say the Ultra 12, I would say that the iodine.
[02:41:08.980 --> 02:41:09.620]  Have you taken those?
[02:41:11.047 --> 02:41:11.488]  No, I haven't.
[02:41:11.488 --> 02:41:12.669]  I just got the Privacy Pouch.
[02:41:12.669 --> 02:41:14.071]  I was just asking about the supplements.
[02:41:14.071 --> 02:41:16.714]  I just figured, because, you know, adrenaline is like, pretty much like Jesus juice.
[02:41:16.714 --> 02:41:19.818]  You could, you know, if somebody threatened your family, you could lift up a car or something.
[02:41:19.818 --> 02:41:20.960]  That's really powerful energy.
[02:41:20.960 --> 02:41:24.184]  And I just figured adrenal support would be critical in these times.
[02:41:24.184 --> 02:41:26.066]  No, you're absolutely right.
[02:41:26.066 --> 02:41:27.669]  And when I say adrenal support, I don't just think of the...
[02:41:29.401 --> 02:41:30.002]  I don't think so.
[02:41:49.321 --> 02:41:50.081]  We're good to go.
[02:42:12.873 --> 02:42:19.060]  Everybody thinks it's a bio attack or something and then they rush to get the vaccines and then they won't even be able to leave like the 5G grid.
[02:42:19.060 --> 02:42:20.662]  It'll be like a shot collar.
[02:42:20.662 --> 02:42:23.846]  And what you're saying is from your own research, your own gut level.
[02:42:25.812 --> 02:42:27.713]  The polls are shifting.
[02:42:27.713 --> 02:42:28.373]  That's happening.
[02:42:28.373 --> 02:42:29.433]  That's proven.
[02:42:29.433 --> 02:42:30.853]  And a lot of crazy stuff's going on.
[02:42:30.853 --> 02:42:35.375]  And we know the Earth gets hit by asteroids and comets a lot more often than they had said previously.
[02:42:35.375 --> 02:42:36.155]  And you're absolutely right.
[02:42:36.155 --> 02:42:43.937]  The establishment is acting like they are scared to death and are scurrying around trying to lock us down ahead of something big.
[02:42:43.937 --> 02:42:45.437]  And I totally agree with you.
[02:42:45.437 --> 02:42:46.378]  What do you think, Owen?
[02:42:46.378 --> 02:42:47.118]  What do you think, Savannah?
[02:42:48.424 --> 02:42:51.046]  Well, if you look through human history, there's always cycles.
[02:42:51.046 --> 02:42:58.590]  I know that we've covered these cycles here, whether it's just recent recorded history or even ancient recorded history.
[02:42:58.590 --> 02:43:07.135]  So there's always cycles, and I mean, we won't go too esoteric or deep into this stuff, but I mean, we know very little, at least we're told very little about ancient civilization.
[02:43:07.135 --> 02:43:13.319]  We know wars always start during sunspots, and we know depressions start during... I mean, I guess Wall Street follows that.
[02:43:13.559 --> 02:43:31.490]  Yeah, my response to Nicholas would be that absolutely there is a class of elite that has access to history that they don't allow the general public to have, and they are probably trying to plan events around that, whether it's... Yeah, why are all the billionaires building armored bunkers with runways in the middle of nowhere?
[02:43:31.490 --> 02:43:32.951]  It's not because of COVID, folks.
[02:43:32.951 --> 02:43:37.693]  And they'll make the reasoning as, oh, you can't tell humans all this, they'll go into a panic.
[02:43:37.693 --> 02:43:40.235]  It's really just so they can get prepared before the rest of us.
[02:43:41.408 --> 02:43:49.845]  And they want to tell us lockdown, so I guess when some bio-weapon gets released, or like you said, some Super Carrington event hits and a bunch of people physically get ill from it.
[02:43:49.845 --> 02:43:50.265]  What do you think?
[02:43:51.095 --> 02:43:59.081]  Alex, I'm not well-versed on this type of stuff, but I would say to anyone who's like me, continue listening to Alex Jones because he's constantly talking about this type of stuff.
[02:43:59.081 --> 02:44:02.224]  And also selling storable foods to help with this type of stuff.
[02:44:02.224 --> 02:44:03.325]  You know, preparedness.
[02:44:03.325 --> 02:44:04.666]  That's a very important thing.
[02:44:04.666 --> 02:44:11.831]  Well, that's one reason I'm mad at myself is, at a selfish level, I want to just move to the middle of nowhere with my kids and just not do this anymore.
[02:44:11.831 --> 02:44:13.472]  It's not because I'm afraid of the globalists.
[02:44:13.472 --> 02:44:17.836]  I feel guilty that I'm staying in a major city.
[02:44:17.836 --> 02:44:18.636]  I just feel like that.
[02:44:18.636 --> 02:44:19.117]  How do you feel?
[02:44:20.399 --> 02:44:20.919]  Same, Alex.
[02:44:20.919 --> 02:44:34.565]  You know, after living here in Austin, Texas, especially, and watching the deterioration of our city with the homelessness, with all of the people coming here, destroying small businesses, destroying people's livelihoods.
[02:44:34.565 --> 02:44:35.165]  That's right.
[02:44:35.165 --> 02:44:36.926]  You only got out of school a few years ago.
[02:44:36.926 --> 02:44:38.286]  We were in San Antonio, right?
[02:44:38.286 --> 02:44:38.786]  Mm-hmm.
[02:44:38.786 --> 02:44:40.187]  And so that's deteriorated, too.
[02:44:40.187 --> 02:44:42.408]  But Austin, I mean, Austin's falling apart.
[02:44:42.788 --> 02:44:43.068]  Right.
[02:44:43.068 --> 02:44:44.589]  I mean, you want what, like two, three years?
[02:44:44.589 --> 02:44:46.310]  This is the first time I've lived somewhere.
[02:44:46.310 --> 02:44:47.231]  You know, I'm paying bills.
[02:44:47.231 --> 02:44:48.232]  I'm living on my own.
[02:44:48.232 --> 02:44:51.054]  And for the first time, I'm living by myself.
[02:44:51.054 --> 02:44:54.996]  And I had to move out of my old apartment because the homelessness was getting so bad.
[02:44:54.996 --> 02:44:58.399]  I had to go and buy a gun because I don't feel safe living in my own city.
[02:44:59.219 --> 02:45:02.242]  Uh, anymore because there's people knocking on my door.
[02:45:02.242 --> 02:45:04.444]  There's homeless people going through my trash can at night.
[02:45:04.444 --> 02:45:05.205]  It's terrifying.
[02:45:05.205 --> 02:45:12.612]  So, to see the deterioration of these big cities and how this is spread across America and no one's really doing anything about it.
[02:45:12.612 --> 02:45:13.373]  What's causing it?
[02:45:13.373 --> 02:45:15.755]  I mean, it's the catering to the homeless.
[02:45:16.181 --> 02:45:17.502]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:45:17.502 --> 02:45:21.425]  And our mayor allowing people to camp in the streets.
[02:45:21.425 --> 02:45:23.907]  We're enabling this every single day.
[02:45:23.907 --> 02:45:25.928]  And, you know, it's only going to keep getting worse.
[02:45:25.928 --> 02:45:28.350]  We're going to turn into... Well, it's like, you know, Joe Rogan's moving to Texas.
[02:45:28.350 --> 02:45:30.832]  I'm not going to say where, but where do you think he's going to move?
[02:45:30.832 --> 02:45:33.194]  It's kind of like an Empire Strikes Back.
[02:45:33.194 --> 02:45:34.055]  He goes, I'm looking for Yoda.
[02:45:34.055 --> 02:45:35.776]  He goes, oh, Yoda not far.
[02:45:35.776 --> 02:45:36.576]  I'll take you to him.
[02:45:36.576 --> 02:45:41.020]  But, uh... Alex, I heard you had an incident with some bum piss today.
[02:45:42.284 --> 02:45:46.487]  Well, yeah, Steven Crowder's hanging over this bridge.
[02:45:46.487 --> 02:45:50.630]  There's all these homeless down there, and there's like needles and feces everywhere.
[02:45:50.630 --> 02:45:52.151]  He goes, that smells like bum piss.
[02:45:52.151 --> 02:45:55.554]  I go, and I know the smell, and it makes me sick.
[02:45:55.554 --> 02:46:01.659]  It's actually, the smell is of dust mites and their excrement.
[02:46:01.659 --> 02:46:02.940]  It's like musty or something?
[02:46:02.940 --> 02:46:05.301]  Yeah, and I started almost throwing up.
[02:46:05.301 --> 02:46:06.863]  Retching in the street.
[02:46:07.830 --> 02:46:09.254]  This was on camera, right?
[02:46:09.254 --> 02:46:09.815]  It was a sightseeing.
[02:46:09.815 --> 02:46:10.598]  It wasn't fake.
[02:46:10.598 --> 02:46:14.668]  He's like... No, I mean, you took a big whiff of bum piss and it wasn't good for ya.
[02:46:15.370 --> 02:46:16.391]  But it's not just the bump.
[02:46:16.391 --> 02:46:17.832]  I mean, let me tell you something.
[02:46:17.832 --> 02:46:19.053]  I went to Skid Row in L.A.
[02:46:19.053 --> 02:46:19.713]  a few years ago.
[02:46:19.713 --> 02:46:20.374]  It was horrific.
[02:46:20.374 --> 02:46:20.994]  It was horrible.
[02:46:20.994 --> 02:46:23.076]  I saw stuff I'd never imagined.
[02:46:23.076 --> 02:46:24.417]  You see concentration camp footage.
[02:46:24.417 --> 02:46:24.897]  It's terrible.
[02:46:24.897 --> 02:46:27.639]  But those people aren't, like, demonically possessed.
[02:46:27.639 --> 02:46:32.403]  I mean, these are, like, people going... You can see their spine.
[02:46:32.403 --> 02:46:34.044]  They're so skinny on heroin.
[02:46:34.044 --> 02:46:35.265]  And then it's a tranny.
[02:46:35.265 --> 02:46:40.849]  So it's like a skeleton tranny going... ...at you with flies all over their genitals hanging out.
[02:46:42.369 --> 02:46:53.256]  But now we're going by doorways and there's like people like vampire movies like wriggling in dirt with sores all over their body and piles of needles and it's just like, what the hell is this?
[02:46:53.256 --> 02:46:53.956]  It's out of control.
[02:46:53.956 --> 02:46:59.160]  Actually, I shot a special about three years ago where I went into the woods and just found so many heaps of trash.
[02:46:59.160 --> 02:47:04.103]  And you know, there's actually homeless people here that actually do care about the city and love the city and they hate to see what's happening.
[02:47:04.103 --> 02:47:08.246]  A lot of them are veterans, a lot of them are mentally ill, but it's the new class of the... Which have been bust in.
[02:47:08.246 --> 02:47:09.867]  But you know, Alex, I'll tell you this.
[02:47:11.059 --> 02:47:14.121]  And maybe the crew can find this in the final minute here.
[02:47:14.121 --> 02:47:17.884]  When I moved here five years ago, it was the top city.
[02:47:17.884 --> 02:47:25.349]  Austin was considered the top city to move to, one of the top cities to live in, no matter what travel guide or web, you know, travel site you had.
[02:47:25.349 --> 02:47:28.572]  It was like Austin was always top one or two or top five guaranteed.
[02:47:29.232 --> 02:47:30.153]  And that's when I moved here.
[02:47:30.153 --> 02:47:31.313]  I've been here five years.
[02:47:31.313 --> 02:47:34.735]  There is no way Austin is topping these lists again.
[02:47:34.735 --> 02:47:39.237]  There is no way that I would tell people to move to Austin.
[02:47:39.237 --> 02:47:42.199]  There's literally homeless under every overpass.
[02:47:42.199 --> 02:47:46.921]  This is footage that I shot about two or three years ago when it really started to get out of control here.
[02:47:46.921 --> 02:47:50.904]  And it's sad because I've witnessed it with my own two eyes, living here five years, Austin
[02:47:51.884 --> 02:47:58.930]  Uh, which was really on the rise and the industry's still booming and, you know, the nice leftist liberal companies are all coming here to destroy our infrastructure.
[02:47:58.930 --> 02:48:06.217]  But now, I mean, Austin is going the way of L.A., and unless there's a drastic pivot the other direction, it's, uh, it's not going to be pleasant, sadly.
[02:48:06.217 --> 02:48:12.682]  And that was the red pill for me, too, just actually watching our Democrat mayor take a beautiful city and completely ruin it.
[02:48:12.682 --> 02:48:13.463]  And incentivize it.
[02:48:13.903 --> 02:48:14.383]  Exactly.
[02:48:14.383 --> 02:48:16.685]  Well, I fly around with Shane Stoddard in his helicopter.
[02:48:16.685 --> 02:48:18.486]  There's garbage like this everywhere.
[02:48:18.486 --> 02:48:18.926]  Yeah.
[02:48:18.926 --> 02:48:20.167]  Like, I used to fly over woods.
[02:48:20.167 --> 02:48:21.188]  Well, I talk to the homeless.
[02:48:21.188 --> 02:48:28.452]  What they do is they just go dumpsters of trash, and they take it back there, and they sift through it for what they want, and then they just leave it there.
[02:48:28.452 --> 02:48:31.174]  So... But Mayor Adler doesn't address that.
[02:48:31.174 --> 02:48:33.355]  But if you try to cut a two-inch tree in your backyard, they arrest you.
[02:48:33.355 --> 02:48:35.697]  Or, like, you have a chicken in the wrong area, you don't address that.
[02:48:37.176 --> 02:48:47.980]  Americans have had freedom for so long, and most Americans were born into such docile times compared to the rest of history, that we really have a blind spot for tyranny.
[02:48:47.980 --> 02:48:57.203]  We don't appreciate the American way, truth, justice, due process, the right to self-defense, private property, because we've had it so long, and we just think that's how the rest of the world is.
[02:48:57.563 --> 02:49:11.725]  Ladies and gentlemen, the renaissance, the social contract that's 500 years old to try to build up humanity and try to believe in humanity and try to empower the weak as well as the strong is something the West invented and that's what made our modern world.
[02:49:11.725 --> 02:49:25.928]  That's now been hijacked by the technocrats, by the globalists who say humans are ugly and bad for the Earth and we need to be culled and dumped down and put into subgroups that the elites dominate, manipulate and command if we're even lucky enough to stay alive.
[02:49:26.388 --> 02:49:28.090]  And that's what COVID-19 is.
[02:49:28.090 --> 02:49:34.776]  A global UN revolution against free humanity, against your family, against prosperity, and against your future.
[02:49:34.776 --> 02:49:38.520]  If you don't stand up and fight, you deserve what you get.
[02:49:38.520 --> 02:49:43.704]  A lot of you are probably already very familiar with these terms I'm about to introduce, but some folks aren't.
[02:49:43.704 --> 02:49:46.107]  So, for those that aren't, here they are.
[02:49:46.107 --> 02:49:48.789]  Activated charcoal.
[02:49:48.789 --> 02:49:51.352]  And then another term, enamel safe.
[02:49:52.927 --> 02:49:59.472]  Activated charcoal is the fastest growing type of toothpaste for a good reason.
[02:49:59.472 --> 02:50:00.452]  It really, really works.
[02:50:00.452 --> 02:50:15.403]  Well, we've come up with the best activated charcoal toothpaste with no fillers, the cleanest type, the highest quality, with a bunch of high quality essential oils and other ingredients known and documented to do amazing things for your oral hygiene and your overall health and your mouth.
[02:50:15.403 --> 02:50:19.966]  It's so critical and it makes your teeth look really white and really, really clean and it's good for your gums.
[02:50:20.606 --> 02:50:21.887]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:50:53.127 --> 02:50:56.748]  Hi Alex, Savannah and Big O. I have a spicy torta milanesa for y'all.
[02:50:56.748 --> 02:50:57.728]  As broadcasted orators,
[02:51:20.632 --> 02:51:23.734]  You've all undeniably mastered the human tongue.
[02:51:23.734 --> 02:51:33.819]  So I was wondering, Landon, if you've heard of the Senagora, or in Indian, dot-not-feather, half-a-yoga technique of Pikari Mudra.
[02:51:33.819 --> 02:51:40.262]  That's K-H-E-C-A-R-I, space M-U-D-R-A.
[02:51:40.262 --> 02:51:42.864]  Well, the master is always the student, so I've not heard of this.
[02:51:42.864 --> 02:51:43.404]  Tell me about it.
[02:51:43.404 --> 02:51:45.985]  Is this Taoism?
[02:51:45.985 --> 02:51:47.186]  Uh, it's a yoga technique.
[02:51:47.680 --> 02:52:00.932]  And with adrenochrome, DMT stuff, astral stuff, and CIA declassification of the same being so hot right now, the Cernigora tongue technique is according to Wikipedia, quote, the practice carried out of curling the tip of the tongue of the
[02:52:01.519 --> 02:52:06.583]  Back into the mouth until it reaches above the soft palate and into the nasal cavity.
[02:52:06.583 --> 02:52:11.888]  Yeah, that's also a practice of Kui Gong or Chi Gong, which is Taoism or Taoism.
[02:52:11.888 --> 02:52:14.150]  I actually practiced that for a year straight.
[02:52:14.150 --> 02:52:15.991]  You stick your tongue up into your sinuses?
[02:52:15.991 --> 02:52:26.861]  So there's a bunch of things you do, but one of the things, it's to basically have the Tao or the One or God flow through you, and there's a bunch of different yoga techniques and body techniques.
[02:52:27.421 --> 02:52:28.742]  Yes, basically.
[02:52:28.742 --> 02:52:29.162]  Basically.
[02:52:29.162 --> 02:52:39.125]  But yes, the tongue to the top of the mouth is well-versed in history to be a way to be connected to God or the Creator.
[02:52:39.125 --> 02:52:42.306]  Enlighten yourself, if you will.
[02:52:42.306 --> 02:52:44.667]  It's fair to say Hillary Clinton's not doing that.
[02:52:44.667 --> 02:52:48.769]  No, she does the cheat code, which is, well, we know about that.
[02:52:48.769 --> 02:52:49.549]  We'll just keep it at that.
[02:52:50.097 --> 02:52:51.458]  But wow, that's what you're talking about, right?
[02:52:51.458 --> 02:52:53.440]  Is putting the tongue on the top of the mouth.
[02:52:53.440 --> 02:52:54.441]  Savannah, what do we do with our tongue?
[02:52:54.441 --> 02:52:55.802]  Centering your gravity.
[02:52:55.802 --> 02:52:56.983]  Tell us about this.
[02:52:56.983 --> 02:52:58.565]  I don't know, Alex.
[02:52:58.565 --> 02:53:00.066]  No comment on that one.
[02:53:00.066 --> 02:53:04.791]  I have not looked into this type of practice.
[02:53:04.791 --> 02:53:07.453]  Look at Hillary's tongue.
[02:53:07.453 --> 02:53:08.874]  She's got a little... Terrifying.
[02:53:08.874 --> 02:53:10.696]  A little syphilis sore on her.
[02:53:10.696 --> 02:53:11.577]  A little lesion there.
[02:53:14.244 --> 02:53:17.966]  Yeah, her girlfriends don't want her to go down on earnings.
[02:53:17.966 --> 02:53:19.086]  That was a wild call.
[02:53:19.086 --> 02:53:21.247]  Joe in Arkansas!
[02:53:21.247 --> 02:53:23.628]  Come on down!
[02:53:23.628 --> 02:53:25.309]  Okay, thank you, Alex.
[02:53:25.309 --> 02:53:34.853]  Yeah, you asked for people to come up with their solutions, and I think this is the good, common-sense, legal, constitutional American solution to the present crisis.
[02:53:34.853 --> 02:53:37.474]  Okay, I think the Democrat Party, clearly,
[02:53:38.460 --> 02:53:44.145]  ...has now become a criminal organization and insurrection against the country is not a legitimate... Oh, I agree.
[02:53:44.145 --> 02:53:46.206]  I mean, they're like a psychotic group of lunatics.
[02:53:46.206 --> 02:53:47.908]  They're even worse than criminal.
[02:53:47.908 --> 02:53:49.749]  They're like lunatics.
[02:53:49.749 --> 02:54:01.598]  So, the Constitution says that one of the functions of the militia is to suppress insurrection, and it says that the president is commander-in-chief of the militia.
[02:54:01.598 --> 02:54:07.283]  And I understand the state laws generally define the militia as basically all the patriotic citizens
[02:54:07.811 --> 02:54:08.391]  Oh yeah.
[02:54:08.391 --> 02:54:10.152]  I'm 46 though, I'm retired.
[02:54:10.152 --> 02:54:12.912]  I'm not living in the militia now.
[02:54:12.912 --> 02:54:13.672]  How convenient.
[02:54:30.283 --> 02:54:31.644]  No, but I hear what you're saying, brother.
[02:54:31.644 --> 02:54:34.606]  I mean, the truth is, they think the nation-state's outdated.
[02:54:34.606 --> 02:54:43.332]  They're replacing it with a nightmare globalist system, where the elites fly around in private jets and have huge private estates, and then where they fund everybody to take fentanyl until they die.
[02:54:43.936 --> 02:54:45.176]  Yeah, but let's be clear here, Alex.
[02:54:45.176 --> 02:54:48.798]  I mean, human freedom is destined to go worldwide eventually.
[02:54:48.798 --> 02:54:50.518]  I mean, there's going to be struggles and plight.
[02:54:50.518 --> 02:54:52.279]  This is a war against that.
[02:54:52.279 --> 02:54:59.782]  But it's a war that when the global system of human freedom goes into place, they've already set up the global system of enslavement.
[02:54:59.782 --> 02:55:00.802]  So that's all they're trying to do.
[02:55:00.802 --> 02:55:03.823]  They're getting ahead of the global freedom with their global enslavement.
[02:55:03.823 --> 02:55:04.263]  No, I totally agree.
[02:55:04.263 --> 02:55:05.064]  That's globalism.
[02:55:05.064 --> 02:55:05.944]  I totally agree.
[02:55:05.944 --> 02:55:08.125]  And that's what the Democrats are in on.
[02:55:08.125 --> 02:55:10.926]  But you can teach us techniques with your tongue to defeat it.
[02:55:12.919 --> 02:55:16.110]  I haven't practiced Qigong for some time.
[02:55:16.110 --> 02:55:17.816]  Can you show us how to be one with God real quick?
[02:55:19.797 --> 02:55:21.299]  It takes months.
[02:55:21.299 --> 02:55:22.740]  It took me months to master this.
[02:55:22.740 --> 02:55:23.541]  People laugh at it.
[02:55:23.541 --> 02:55:25.062]  It's pretty goofy, I'm not going to lie.
[02:55:25.062 --> 02:55:28.065]  But you will open your chakras.
[02:55:28.065 --> 02:55:36.172]  Is that like Starface where he goes like... to the girl?
[02:55:36.172 --> 02:55:37.293]  Not quite.
[02:55:37.293 --> 02:55:40.335]  Not exactly.
[02:55:40.335 --> 02:55:43.859]  Your sensei would be correcting your tongue movements if that was going on.
[02:55:46.684 --> 02:55:49.626]  America and the world should have never been closed.
[02:55:49.626 --> 02:55:56.171]  It was all based on WHO, Bill and Melinda Gates, Fauci, NIH lies.
[02:55:56.171 --> 02:56:06.339]  But now, here we are, already into August, and they're trying to keep our stores, our factories, our schools, our parks closed.
[02:56:06.339 --> 02:56:08.501]  It is outrageous.
[02:56:08.501 --> 02:56:10.623]  Well, we have launched a new big sale.
[02:56:11.363 --> 02:56:11.604]  I don't
[02:56:26.423 --> 02:56:29.366]  We still have it at 50% off, but for a limited time.
[02:56:29.366 --> 02:56:33.311]  Living Defense, which is beyond probiotics, 50% off.
[02:56:33.311 --> 02:56:39.218]  Vazo Beets, amazing concentrated beet extract with all of its benefits, selling out, so 50% off.
[02:56:39.218 --> 02:56:42.642]  And so much more at infowarestore.com.
[02:56:42.642 --> 02:56:44.744]  And your purchase funds The Info War, a true 360 win.
[02:56:57.833 --> 02:56:59.154]  Qigong!
[02:56:59.154 --> 02:57:03.638]  You're with the... Welcome to the Qigong Hour.
[02:57:03.638 --> 02:57:04.919]  Don't arrest me, China.
[02:57:04.919 --> 02:57:07.141]  A guy calls in, he goes, have you heard of this?
[02:57:07.141 --> 02:57:10.184]  You say the Khmer Rouge did it, or they were against it?
[02:57:10.184 --> 02:57:13.707]  No, they were practicing Taoism.
[02:57:13.707 --> 02:57:15.429]  That made them kill 30% of the Republic.
[02:57:15.429 --> 02:57:17.591]  Well, we better not do it then.
[02:57:17.591 --> 02:57:20.073]  No, that's what they wanted them to stop doing.
[02:57:21.318 --> 02:57:21.979]  Oh!
[02:57:21.979 --> 02:57:23.301]  Yeah.
[02:57:23.301 --> 02:57:27.065]  That was the religious practice that was getting banned, that you couldn't do.
[02:57:27.065 --> 02:57:28.687]  Oh, so you trotted out?
[02:57:28.687 --> 02:57:28.947]  I did.
[02:57:28.947 --> 02:57:30.289]  I'll give you your tongue.
[02:57:32.967 --> 02:57:41.712]  You have to place your tongue perfectly on the top of the palate of your mouth in the right place to center your chi.
[02:57:41.712 --> 02:57:43.353]  I'm gonna smell homelessness.
[02:57:43.353 --> 02:57:44.413]  You center your chi.
[02:57:44.413 --> 02:57:46.094]  No, that throws the chi off, Alex.
[02:57:46.094 --> 02:57:46.695]  See?
[02:57:46.695 --> 02:57:48.576]  This is why your chi is so off today.
[02:57:48.576 --> 02:57:51.737]  You took a big, fat whiff of bum piss.
[02:57:51.737 --> 02:57:52.818]  That is how he started his day.
[02:57:53.038 --> 02:57:55.899]  Okay, that's how you started your day, and your chi was all off.
[02:57:55.899 --> 02:58:10.046]  You didn't do the Wim Hof method, you didn't smell the flowers, you took a big fat fentanyl-laced whiff of urine down in the slums here in Austin now, and your chi is all off, Alex.
[02:58:10.046 --> 02:58:12.908]  I'm not exaggerating, I think we have footage of it.
[02:58:12.908 --> 02:58:13.728]  We do.
[02:58:13.728 --> 02:58:16.750]  Dust mite infested Alex Jones this morning.
[02:58:17.270 --> 02:58:23.852]  No, but I mean, the woman's like wriggling around the corner, and she's like super vampire white skin with like brothels all over.
[02:58:23.852 --> 02:58:24.292]  It's not good.
[02:58:24.292 --> 02:58:25.312]  Like every seminar.
[02:58:25.312 --> 02:58:26.773]  And she's just like needles on her face.
[02:58:26.773 --> 02:58:28.473]  She's like a vampire.
[02:58:28.473 --> 02:58:34.175]  She saw you and she started just crawling away, and she had sores all over her legs from head to toe.
[02:58:34.175 --> 02:58:37.416]  And you know, all the crew was like, oh, are you okay?
[02:58:37.416 --> 02:58:38.156]  We didn't even see her.
[02:58:38.156 --> 02:58:39.917]  We're like, oh, like a vampire.
[02:58:41.417 --> 02:58:47.841]  Yeah, and then this other guy just popped out of a random door on the side of the building as well, and we were just like, where are we right now?
[02:58:47.841 --> 02:58:49.402]  What's going on in Austin?
[02:58:49.402 --> 02:58:51.403]  And the dude looked like, what are you doing here?
[02:58:52.190 --> 02:58:52.671]  Exactly!
[02:58:52.671 --> 02:58:53.592]  He was like, why are y'all here?
[02:58:53.592 --> 02:58:54.713]  And we're like, why are you guys here?
[02:58:54.713 --> 02:58:56.195]  It was like an eel just came out of a hole.
[02:58:56.195 --> 02:59:01.882]  And I was just like, why are we in downtown Austin right now smelling piss at 9am?
[02:59:01.882 --> 02:59:03.243]  This is not how I want to start my day.
[02:59:03.243 --> 02:59:03.904]  But it was good.
[02:59:03.904 --> 02:59:04.485]  It was good footage.
[02:59:04.485 --> 02:59:08.149]  We're not normally doing that, but it was Steven Crowder's like, come meet us at the Capitals.
[02:59:08.149 --> 02:59:09.951]  We get there, and he's not there.
[02:59:09.951 --> 02:59:11.333]  He goes, oh, we're meeting on 6th Street now.
[02:59:11.833 --> 02:59:15.375]  Alex wanted to take him to the most homeless ridden, nastiest parts of Austin.
[02:59:15.375 --> 02:59:16.656]  No, no, that was his idea.
[02:59:16.656 --> 02:59:18.997]  He wanted, but yeah, you showed him the best parts though.
[02:59:18.997 --> 02:59:21.058]  You're like, this is what Democrat leadership looks like.
[02:59:21.058 --> 02:59:26.682]  There actually is a nice, there's actually a nice little river walk here in Austin, but it's completely defiled now.
[02:59:26.682 --> 02:59:29.743]  It's just defaced and defiled and the homeless have taken it over.
[02:59:29.743 --> 02:59:31.524]  There's a nice little homeless walk now.
[02:59:31.524 --> 02:59:36.767]  Well, the weirdest thing, especially LA, how many of the homeless people they give hormones to.
[02:59:36.767 --> 02:59:39.369]  So you'll see a half-naked man with huge breasts now.
[02:59:39.969 --> 02:59:41.771]  With flies all over them.
[02:59:41.771 --> 02:59:42.611]  I'm not kidding.
[02:59:42.611 --> 02:59:44.092]  No, I remember the stories.
[02:59:44.092 --> 02:59:45.273]  Because I do not.
[02:59:45.273 --> 02:59:46.374]  Why the hormones?
[02:59:46.374 --> 02:59:47.775]  Look, I want to be clear.
[02:59:47.775 --> 02:59:48.536]  No, no, no.
[02:59:48.536 --> 02:59:52.239]  I'm sitting there in skid row like trying to do an interview.
[02:59:52.239 --> 02:59:52.599]  And I didn't.
[02:59:52.599 --> 02:59:53.680]  And then they move real slow.
[02:59:53.680 --> 02:59:56.803]  I see somebody wriggling around in this tent.
[02:59:56.803 --> 02:59:59.225]  There's these two transsexual men.
[02:59:59.225 --> 03:00:00.586]  I remember this story.
[03:00:00.586 --> 03:00:01.967]  And then so I move away.
[03:00:01.967 --> 03:00:03.769]  All of a sudden I turn around and they're going like.
[03:00:04.189 --> 03:00:04.849]  Wriggling around?
[03:00:04.849 --> 03:00:06.090]  Is that what you're going to call it?
[03:00:06.090 --> 03:00:06.611]  No, I'm not joking.
[03:00:06.611 --> 03:00:07.732]  I'm not joking.
[03:00:07.732 --> 03:00:11.575]  Literally, and I look down, and it's this starving black dude.
[03:00:11.575 --> 03:00:16.438]  You can see his spine, and the skin looked like melted black candle wax.
[03:00:16.438 --> 03:00:18.300]  Like Adam was worse than a zombie movie.
[03:00:18.300 --> 03:00:22.683]  And I look down, wearing a skirt with flies all over the genitals.
[03:00:22.683 --> 03:00:25.565]  And this is like one second, I'm like, and I smell it.
[03:00:25.565 --> 03:00:26.366]  And I was like, I just started running.
[03:00:26.366 --> 03:00:26.986]  That was Skid Row.
[03:00:26.986 --> 03:00:29.028]  And I'm with these off-duty police we hired.
[03:00:29.028 --> 03:00:30.969]  We're like running back to the car at this point.
[03:00:30.969 --> 03:00:31.710]  That was Skid Row?
[03:00:32.290 --> 03:00:35.073]  Dude, I've told the story, not to be gross, folks.
[03:00:35.073 --> 03:00:37.595]  I've never seen anything like it.
[03:00:37.595 --> 03:00:41.740]  Because it's one thing to see somebody with flies all over them, like in some war zone or something.
[03:00:41.740 --> 03:00:47.645]  This is someone, literally on heroin or fentanyl, coming towards me like a demon.
[03:00:50.504 --> 03:00:52.905]  With, with, with, on hormones and heroin.
[03:00:52.905 --> 03:00:58.467]  I say here's the problem is we do live in such a prosperous society that we shouldn't have that in our society.
[03:00:58.467 --> 03:00:59.707]  No one has that!
[03:00:59.707 --> 03:01:02.228]  We have so much in this country.
[03:01:02.228 --> 03:01:06.290]  We have so much in this country we shouldn't have to deal with that, but it's, it's all self-destructive.
[03:01:06.290 --> 03:01:06.790]  Yeah, look at this!
[03:01:07.841 --> 03:01:08.622]  Well, that's a nice throne.
[03:01:08.622 --> 03:01:09.803]  These are real images.
[03:01:09.803 --> 03:01:11.966]  I mean, you can't make this stuff up.
[03:01:11.966 --> 03:01:13.888]  And this is exactly what's coming to Austin, Texas.
[03:01:13.888 --> 03:01:15.670]  Alex, I watched it at 2 p.m.
[03:01:15.670 --> 03:01:16.331]  Somebody shooting.
[03:01:16.331 --> 03:01:17.613]  It goes on for hundreds of square miles.
[03:01:17.613 --> 03:01:18.794]  It just goes on for miles.
[03:01:18.794 --> 03:01:21.277]  We've only got like two blocks of that in Austin right now.
[03:01:21.277 --> 03:01:21.858]  Right now.
[03:01:21.858 --> 03:01:23.260]  Give it a couple years.
[03:01:23.260 --> 03:01:23.880]  Are you joking?
[03:01:23.880 --> 03:01:25.042]  There's like homeless camps everywhere.
[03:01:25.362 --> 03:01:37.246]  Yeah, but I mean like that though, like the worst of the worst, the drug addicts, like the crackdown on- And you see there's all these new Escalades, and like you drive by with police and they're like, F you to the police, what are you doing?
[03:01:37.246 --> 03:01:38.946]  The city council doesn't leave it alone.
[03:01:38.946 --> 03:01:51.650]  No, I liked your idea actually that you had earlier, I mean, why don't we, of course again they don't do it now, everything's digital, but it's like yeah, if we went into city council during whatever hearing they were having and we just took the mic and started making a scene,
[03:01:52.731 --> 03:01:54.452]  Get the police up here immediately!
[03:01:54.452 --> 03:01:57.353]  We need the police, but you just said defund the police!
[03:01:57.353 --> 03:01:59.573]  I thought, wait, so what are you gonna do?
[03:01:59.573 --> 03:02:01.054]  Oh, are you gonna come kick me out yourself?
[03:02:01.054 --> 03:02:02.294]  I doubt that!
[03:02:02.294 --> 03:02:07.856]  No, I'm gonna start, I'm gonna start legally going after the W. I mean, we need to start pushing back.
[03:02:07.856 --> 03:02:11.518]  Um, let's play, what's the name of the sportscaster that laid it out really good a while back?
[03:02:11.518 --> 03:02:12.438]  I never heard it.
[03:02:12.438 --> 03:02:13.578]  Marcellus Wiley.
[03:02:13.578 --> 03:02:15.099]  Yeah, let's go ahead and roll this.
[03:02:15.099 --> 03:02:17.700]  Here's a Marcellus Wiley, folks.
[03:02:17.700 --> 03:02:18.900]  Marcellus, I'm gonna start with you.
[03:02:18.900 --> 03:02:19.761]  Yeah.
[03:02:19.761 --> 03:02:20.821]  Is this a good idea?
[03:02:22.416 --> 03:02:23.917]  Ah, it's not a good idea.
[03:02:23.917 --> 03:02:33.143]  I do want to give the players credit for their flex to even get this to be more than just an idea, but something that's going to be in reality.
[03:02:33.143 --> 03:02:34.865]  I give the players that.
[03:02:34.865 --> 03:02:46.493]  But there's a problem when you start to go down this road of the freedom of expression, freedom of speech, and how much social spaces allow for those who don't support
[03:02:47.193 --> 03:02:48.334]  In that same space.
[03:02:48.334 --> 03:02:51.617]  And that's where I wonder where this is going to go.
[03:02:51.617 --> 03:02:53.419]  In terms of identity politics.
[03:02:53.419 --> 03:02:56.822]  We know what identity politics does.
[03:02:56.822 --> 03:02:58.623]  It divides and it polarizes.
[03:02:58.623 --> 03:03:01.866]  No matter how you want to look at it, that's just the effect of it.
[03:03:01.866 --> 03:03:04.608]  No matter how great the intentions are.
[03:03:04.608 --> 03:03:08.432]  And we all know the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
[03:03:08.432 --> 03:03:10.854]  So, it's an interesting play right here.
[03:03:10.854 --> 03:03:11.955]  I don't know how many people
[03:03:12.435 --> 03:03:15.524]  Really look into the mission statement of Black Lives Matter.
[03:03:15.524 --> 03:03:16.487]  But I did.
[03:03:16.487 --> 03:03:18.794]  And when you look into it, there's a couple things that jump out.
[03:03:19.625 --> 03:03:20.466]  To me.
[03:03:20.466 --> 03:03:25.169]  And I'm a black man who's been black and my life has mattered since 1974.
[03:03:25.169 --> 03:03:28.011]  And this organization was founded in 2013.
[03:03:28.011 --> 03:03:29.372]  I'm proud of you.
[03:03:29.372 --> 03:03:33.656]  But I've been fighting this fight for me and for others a lot longer.
[03:03:33.656 --> 03:03:34.636]  Two things.
[03:03:34.636 --> 03:03:38.199]  My family structure is so vital, important to me.
[03:03:38.199 --> 03:03:41.822]  Not only the one I grew up in, but the one I'm trying to create right now.
[03:03:41.822 --> 03:03:45.265]  Being a father and a husband, that's my mission in life right now.
[03:03:46.468 --> 03:03:55.136]  How do I reconcile that, what I just told you, with this mission statement that says, quote, we dismantle the patriarchal practice.
[03:03:55.136 --> 03:03:58.980]  We disrupt the Western prescribed nuclear family structure requirement.
[03:03:58.980 --> 03:04:06.947]  When I know statistics, when I know my reality, forget statistics, I knew this before I even went to Columbia and saw these same statistics that I'm going to read to you right now.
[03:04:07.668 --> 03:04:11.969]  That children from single-parent homes versus two-parent homes.
[03:04:11.969 --> 03:04:16.210]  The children from the single-parent homes, this is in 1995 I was reading this.
[03:04:16.210 --> 03:04:18.071]  Five times more likely to commit suicide.
[03:04:18.071 --> 03:04:19.751]  Six times more likely to be in poverty.
[03:04:19.751 --> 03:04:21.512]  Nine times more likely to drop out of high school.
[03:04:21.512 --> 03:04:23.952]  Ten times more likely to abuse chemical substances.
[03:04:23.952 --> 03:04:25.933]  Fourteen times more likely to commit rape.
[03:04:25.933 --> 03:04:28.013]  Twenty times more likely to end up in prison.
[03:04:28.013 --> 03:04:30.294]  And thirty-two times more likely to run away from home.
[03:04:30.894 --> 03:04:31.754]  I knew that.
[03:04:31.754 --> 03:04:32.775]  You know why I knew it?
[03:04:32.775 --> 03:04:43.139]  Because a lot of my friends didn't have family structures that were nuclear like mine, and they found themselves outside of their dreams and goals and aspirations.
[03:04:43.139 --> 03:04:49.621]  So when I see that, or as a mission statement for Black Lives Matter, it makes me scratch my head.
[03:04:49.621 --> 03:04:55.024]  When I also see their mission is to eradicate white supremacy.
[03:04:55.024 --> 03:04:58.245]  In 2020, white supremacy is the mission.
[03:04:59.376 --> 03:05:01.457]  That's a lot of digging through minutiae right there.
[03:05:01.457 --> 03:05:07.639]  I am on a show that I'm hosting along with another black guy who is hosting with me, who replaced another black guy.
[03:05:07.639 --> 03:05:09.840]  And that's just one example of it.
[03:05:09.840 --> 03:05:12.021]  So I understand, I respect your space.
[03:05:12.021 --> 03:05:14.302]  I respect what you're protesting for.
[03:05:14.302 --> 03:05:18.244]  But will you respect others who don't support that same protest?
[03:05:18.244 --> 03:05:22.105]  You rarely see a hole-in-one 100% perfectly developed three minutes, but that was it.
[03:05:22.105 --> 03:05:23.566]  You know it's the key, he said.
[03:05:24.690 --> 03:05:27.716]  I was black before you said you represent me and you own me now.
[03:05:27.716 --> 03:05:32.586]  No, I've been around before you came around and I don't agree with what you're doing and what you're saying is the worst thing for people.
[03:05:32.586 --> 03:05:33.027]  Period.
[03:05:33.027 --> 03:05:33.808]  Savannah?
[03:05:33.808 --> 03:05:33.949]  Owen?
[03:05:35.305 --> 03:05:37.186]  Well, I just, I've seen this too.
[03:05:37.186 --> 03:05:39.608]  I worked in urban and youth development in St.
[03:05:39.608 --> 03:05:40.108]  Louis.
[03:05:40.108 --> 03:05:44.632]  I've seen the difference between kids in high school, and this is in St.
[03:05:44.632 --> 03:05:51.316]  Louis, I mean these are 99% black kids I'm talking about, who had parents in their home cracking the whip on them to do their homework.
[03:05:51.316 --> 03:05:52.457]  They ended up going to college.
[03:05:52.457 --> 03:06:02.004]  They ended up creating businesses versus, unfortunately, the ones that would go up filtering from their aunt's house to their grandma's house to maybe their friend's house who's drug dealing.
[03:06:02.004 --> 03:06:03.024]  They had a lot of problems.
[03:06:03.024 --> 03:06:03.785]  They got in trouble.
[03:06:04.445 --> 03:06:06.447]  And look, that's the thing.
[03:06:06.447 --> 03:06:08.928]  Black Lives Matter is a nice slogan, and they know it.
[03:06:08.928 --> 03:06:10.049]  That's why they go with it.
[03:06:10.049 --> 03:06:11.650]  This has nothing to do with black lives.
[03:06:11.650 --> 03:06:13.411]  Yeah, they don't represent anybody's lives.
[03:06:13.411 --> 03:06:14.972]  They represent destroying you, Savannah.
[03:06:14.972 --> 03:06:17.734]  It's all about division, just like Oprah Winfrey just came forward.
[03:06:17.734 --> 03:06:19.996]  She's a black, what, millionaire, billionaire.
[03:06:20.196 --> 03:06:20.797]  Yeah, billionaire.
[03:06:20.797 --> 03:06:24.520]  And she said that, you know, if you're white, you still have an advantage.
[03:06:24.520 --> 03:06:31.125]  It's all about keeping the black people down by giving them this victimhood mentality and making them think that they aren't equal in society.
[03:06:31.125 --> 03:06:34.428]  And saying you got to do with Oprah, who works with Bill Gates.
[03:06:34.428 --> 03:06:37.210]  She's in that secret eugenics, kill the black people movement.
[03:06:37.210 --> 03:06:37.511]  All right.
[03:06:37.511 --> 03:06:39.913]  You got big reports, fanned out videos of Ann Hernandez.
[03:06:39.913 --> 03:06:42.995]  Owen Sawyer coming up on his own show, 3 p.m.
[03:06:42.995 --> 03:06:43.676]  on Upwork's Red Hood.
[03:06:45.529 --> 03:06:47.270]  Let's go to Juan in Connecticut.
[03:06:47.270 --> 03:06:47.751]  You're on the air.
[03:06:47.751 --> 03:06:48.491]  Thanks for holding.
[03:06:48.491 --> 03:06:50.833]  Sir, it's an honor to talk to you, brother.
[03:07:01.301 --> 03:07:02.761]  I just want to plug in.
[03:07:02.761 --> 03:07:07.182]  I'm a truck driver and two of the fours have changed the way I drive.
[03:07:07.182 --> 03:07:10.103]  Me and my brothers that drive, there's a couple of us.
[03:07:10.103 --> 03:07:13.804]  We're all Hispanics, Cubans, Puerto Ricans.
[03:07:13.804 --> 03:07:21.766]  We used to be on Monster and Red Bull and all that and I have lost weight because I stopped drinking all that sugar and I just want to thank
[03:07:21.866 --> 03:07:22.426]  Thank you for that man.
[03:07:45.575 --> 03:07:50.780]  Allergies, dander, asthma, germs, toxins.
[03:07:50.780 --> 03:07:55.085]  There are many reasons why we need to think about what is really in the air around us.
[03:07:55.085 --> 03:07:59.529]  We may not be able to stop breathing, but we can control what's in the air we breathe.
[03:07:59.529 --> 03:08:07.297]  The revolutionary Alexa Pure Breeze air filtration system is a powerful ally in the fight against the dangerous toxins and viruses in the air.
[03:08:07.918 --> 03:08:15.563]  Powerful, quiet, and effective, the Breathe uses a four-step purification process to help you breathe easier and cleaner.
[03:08:15.563 --> 03:08:23.669]  Similar systems could cost hundreds to even thousands of dollars, but the Alexa Pure Breathe air purification is the best and most affordable bar none.
[03:08:24.489 --> 03:08:32.553]  The breeze and the ion cluster patented technology used in the system eliminate up to 99.97% of airborne contaminants.

[03:08:37.935 --> 03:08:40.196]  Don't keep breathing toxic or dangerous air.
[03:08:40.196 --> 03:08:46.780]  Get this special today at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:08:46.780 --> 03:08:49.401]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:09:01.201 --> 03:09:08.747]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:09:08.747 --> 03:09:11.709]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:09:11.709 --> 03:09:19.756]  And now, your host, John Rappaport.
[03:09:19.756 --> 03:09:22.618]  Okay, here we go.
[03:09:22.618 --> 03:09:24.660]  We've got a bunch of stories to cover today.
[03:09:26.027 --> 03:09:29.008]  Going to see if we can get them all in.
[03:09:29.008 --> 03:09:31.829]  First, a couple of comments about the Beirut bombing.
[03:09:31.829 --> 03:09:38.130]  These are actually questions, because it's still very early here.
[03:09:38.130 --> 03:09:48.933]  But you'll notice that many reports in the mainstream are talking about huge quantities of ammonium nitrate stored at the dock at the port, which blew up.
[03:09:50.974 --> 03:10:11.221]  So, in my 1995 book on the Oklahoma City bombing, of course, the story there was supposedly that a rider truck parked at the curb was filled with barrels of ammonium nitrate, which were set off in an explosion.
[03:10:11.221 --> 03:10:18.304]  But that was called an ANFO bomb, which means ammonium nitrate plus fuel oil.
[03:10:19.708 --> 03:10:25.992]  And it wasn't just fuel oil in a barrel here and ammonium nitrate there.
[03:10:25.992 --> 03:10:30.934]  It was a mix, significant mix.
[03:10:30.934 --> 03:10:37.498]  So I am hearing nothing about fuel oil in the Beirut situation.
[03:10:37.498 --> 03:10:40.320]  That's number one.
[03:10:40.320 --> 03:10:49.345]  Number two, when I spoke with an explosive expert, I spoke with several at the time in 1995 about the Oklahoma City bombing, he said, look,
[03:10:50.396 --> 03:11:16.869]  If this scenario is correct about barrels of ammonium nitrate and fuel oil in the Ryder truck, these would have to be hooked up by det cord very precisely, all the barrels, so that they ignite all at once to get a sustained shock wave.
[03:11:16.869 --> 03:11:20.011]  Otherwise, you're going to end up with fertilizer all over the street.
[03:11:22.595 --> 03:11:49.786]  So the idea of tons and tons of ammonium nitrate stored in the port at Beirut, I have questions about whether that would be ignited all at once in an explosion, unless there was some connection, internal connection, hooking all of this substance up, or
[03:11:50.655 --> 03:12:00.442]  If there was some exterior force of sufficient heat, perhaps, to blow it up all at once.
[03:12:00.442 --> 03:12:06.607]  Fireworks, I think you can forget about that, which has been promoted a bit.
[03:12:06.607 --> 03:12:09.729]  There are questions here about what's happened there.
[03:12:09.729 --> 03:12:12.171]  Serious questions.
[03:12:12.171 --> 03:12:18.876]  I would never accept on surface the idea that it's just ammonium nitrate and it all blew up.
[03:12:20.342 --> 03:12:22.604]  I'm not buying that.
[03:12:22.604 --> 03:12:28.709]  Much more investigation here by independent experts is needed.
[03:12:28.709 --> 03:12:34.354]  Okay, so let's go to COVID now.
[03:12:34.354 --> 03:12:36.435]  Reopening the economies.
[03:12:36.435 --> 03:12:39.958]  I've been warning for months now that this is a game.
[03:12:39.958 --> 03:12:43.902]  We're reopening the economy.
[03:12:43.902 --> 03:12:44.422]  Terrific.
[03:12:44.422 --> 03:12:44.762]  Whatever.
[03:12:46.241 --> 03:12:51.322]  Now we're seeing an escalation of cases, so we may have to shut it down again.
[03:12:51.322 --> 03:12:53.963]  Certain states, etc, etc, etc.
[03:12:53.963 --> 03:12:57.564]  This is a game they play.
[03:12:57.564 --> 03:13:04.646]  Opening the economy, escalation of case numbers, therefore we have to shut it down again.
[03:13:04.646 --> 03:13:05.646]  This is a con.
[03:13:05.646 --> 03:13:06.566]  This is a hustle.
[03:13:06.566 --> 03:13:08.387]  This is a hoax.
[03:13:08.387 --> 03:13:08.827]  Because
[03:13:09.821 --> 03:13:12.943]  There are not escalating case numbers.
[03:13:12.943 --> 03:13:19.045]  There's the fabrication of escalating case numbers, which is very easy to do.
[03:13:19.045 --> 03:13:25.248]  I've explained at least six or seven different ways it's being done.
[03:13:25.248 --> 03:13:38.895]  And therefore, it becomes a very viable strategy for re-locking down and re-punishing the population, wreaking more economic havoc and destroying more lives.
[03:13:39.648 --> 03:13:43.452]  To invent new case numbers.
[03:13:43.452 --> 03:13:54.982]  In other words, the serial progression of reopening economy, escalating case numbers, have to shut it down.
[03:13:54.982 --> 03:13:57.424]  That's not connected.
[03:13:57.424 --> 03:14:05.992]  The news media make it sound like it's all connected, but that's their job, is to take these items that have no meaning
[03:14:07.310 --> 03:14:13.155]  In relationship to each other and wash over the viewer and make him think that it's all connected.
[03:14:13.155 --> 03:14:14.976]  It's not.
[03:14:14.976 --> 03:14:17.998]  And you have to understand that.
[03:14:17.998 --> 03:14:28.326]  And that's even assuming, of course, that a new virus was discovered in the first place in China or anywhere else, which I've disputed with evidence for months now.
[03:14:28.326 --> 03:14:35.352]  But going into the world where people are convinced that there is some sort of virus,
[03:14:37.168 --> 03:14:42.889]  Still, you have an enormous amount of fabrication and invention of case numbers.
[03:14:42.889 --> 03:14:51.091]  The PCR test spits out false positives like coins in a rigged slot machine, etc, etc.
[03:14:51.091 --> 03:14:58.033]  And I'll get to the main CDC fabrication of case number in a little bit here.
[03:14:58.033 --> 03:14:59.234]  So keep this in mind.
[03:14:59.234 --> 03:15:01.094]  Don't fall for this con.
[03:15:02.364 --> 03:15:06.805]  Oh, we tried to reopen the economy, but you see escalating case numbers prevented it.
[03:15:06.805 --> 03:15:09.145]  No, not true.
[03:15:09.145 --> 03:15:10.786]  It's a lie.
[03:15:10.786 --> 03:15:28.509]  They're fabricating the case numbers in order to lock down again, because locking down and economic destruction is, in fact, the whole point of this insane and inhuman exercise.
[03:15:28.509 --> 03:15:29.869]  That's it, in a nutshell.
[03:15:32.378 --> 03:15:48.365]  So let's stay here in the world of insanity where most people assume that a new virus has been discovered and it's at loose in the world.
[03:15:48.365 --> 03:15:56.928]  If you make that assumption, which I don't, but if you do, then how is immunity really attained?
[03:15:58.598 --> 03:16:17.902]  And I've been listening to experts and reading experts on all sides of this for months now, and have come to really the only reasonable conclusion about the gaining of immunity on a mass basis.
[03:16:17.902 --> 03:16:28.264]  And you can boil it down, way down, to something that needs no technical language or gibberish or gobbledygook to understand.
[03:16:29.801 --> 03:16:37.524]  And that is, you attain natural immunity through exposure to the germ.
[03:16:37.524 --> 03:16:41.026]  Everybody, exposure to the germ.
[03:16:41.026 --> 03:16:42.826]  That's it.
[03:16:42.826 --> 03:16:49.749]  That's the way it would be done if, in fact, there were a new virus loose in the world.
[03:16:49.749 --> 03:16:52.450]  Nothing else works.
[03:16:52.450 --> 03:16:57.453]  That works.
[03:16:57.453 --> 03:16:58.413]  It's called nature.
[03:17:00.290 --> 03:17:02.292]  It's called nature, folks.
[03:17:02.292 --> 03:17:09.457]  Everything else is a diversion, a distraction, and a delusion.
[03:17:09.457 --> 03:17:21.126]  The containment measures, the lockdowns, the masks, the distancing, these do not in any way produce mass immunity to a virus.
[03:17:21.126 --> 03:17:27.271]  They postpone, in fact, attaining mass natural immunity to a virus.
[03:17:28.095 --> 03:17:34.017]  That's what is going on with all of these recommendations.
[03:17:34.017 --> 03:17:37.238]  I've got more details on the other side of the break about this.
[03:17:37.238 --> 03:17:41.100]  It's very important to understand the subject of natural immunity.
[03:17:41.832 --> 03:17:42.612]  We'll be back.
[03:17:42.612 --> 03:17:49.816]  I'm really, really proud of the Dr. Jones Naturals activated charcoal, naturally fluoride-free mouthwash and toothpaste.
[03:17:49.816 --> 03:18:00.222]  And if you don't know what activated charcoal does, ladies and gentlemen, it naturally, in a clean way, strips away the toxins, the impurities, the plaque, and it doesn't damage the enamel.
[03:18:00.222 --> 03:18:01.363]  That's really important.
[03:18:01.363 --> 03:18:02.944]  Support The Info War.

[03:18:23.550 --> 03:18:26.911]  I believe you're gonna like this as much as the other toothpaste, maybe even more.
[03:18:26.911 --> 03:18:31.912]  Over a year ago, I tried Charcoal Toothpaste from a major brand and thought it was amazing.
[03:18:31.912 --> 03:18:36.594]  And I went to my dad and people said, I would like to put out a Charcoal Toothpaste that doesn't have all this silicate and all these fillers in it.
[03:18:36.594 --> 03:18:37.994]  Very strong toothpaste.
[03:18:37.994 --> 03:18:39.535]  You've never used anything like it.
[03:18:39.535 --> 03:18:42.735]  Get yours at m4store.com right now.
[03:18:42.735 --> 03:18:45.496]  Just during the break, I went and got a delicious cup.
[03:18:45.496 --> 03:18:46.637]  My second cup of the day.
[03:18:46.637 --> 03:18:47.517]  It's really strong.
[03:18:47.517 --> 03:18:51.438]  I shouldn't do this because all work and no play makes Jack a really aggressive boy.
[03:18:53.255 --> 03:18:55.017]  Yes folks, we've been selling it 10 years.
[03:19:13.817 --> 03:19:14.277]  It's not as popular
[03:19:40.115 --> 03:19:40.235]  Ha!
[03:19:40.235 --> 03:19:42.177]  Anyways, it's all at infowarestore.com.
[03:20:03.005 --> 03:20:03.626]  We're good to go.
[03:20:18.638 --> 03:20:21.419]  That's why when I ask listeners and viewers for your prayer, I mean it.
[03:20:21.419 --> 03:20:22.499]  I'm praying for America.
[03:20:22.499 --> 03:20:23.379]  I'm praying for you.
[03:20:23.379 --> 03:20:25.960]  And I know the power of prayer is real and God hears it.
[03:20:25.960 --> 03:20:29.521]  We need to come together and pray for an even greater awakening.
[03:20:29.521 --> 03:20:31.921]  Pray for Donald Trump to be protected.
[03:20:31.921 --> 03:20:39.463]  Pray for him to win in a landslide and pray for the people under deception of the globalists to awaken and join us in liberty and freedom.
[03:20:39.463 --> 03:20:40.164]  God bless you all.
[03:20:40.164 --> 03:20:41.344]  Please pray for him for us as well.
[03:20:46.132 --> 03:21:01.362]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:21:01.362 --> 03:21:09.367]  Okay, here on the other side of the break, John Rappaport is talking about how people attain natural immunity on a mass basis.
[03:21:10.487 --> 03:21:17.432]  And it's through exposure to a germ, if indeed there is a germ loose in the world.
[03:21:17.432 --> 03:21:19.613]  That's it.
[03:21:19.613 --> 03:21:24.396]  Everything else is complete diversion, distraction and nonsense.
[03:21:24.396 --> 03:21:30.400]  Now, if you want to listen to mainstream reports, get a load of this.
[03:21:30.400 --> 03:21:36.024]  Eleven weeks after the onset of the pandemic, according to mainstream,
[03:21:37.680 --> 03:21:44.024]  There were 30,000 cases worldwide in 99 countries.
[03:21:44.024 --> 03:21:59.113]  So if you believe that, then you believe that the spread was explosive, completely out of control in terms of the reach and the extent of this cure.
[03:21:59.113 --> 03:22:03.216]  Therefore, there would be no way to stop it.
[03:22:03.216 --> 03:22:03.756]  Therefore,
[03:22:04.289 --> 03:22:13.254]  If you try to contain it by locking people down, isolating them in their homes, they have to wear masks, they have to distance, etc.
[03:22:13.254 --> 03:22:13.654]  etc.
[03:22:13.654 --> 03:22:15.955]  etc.
[03:22:15.955 --> 03:22:21.638]  Huge numbers of those people are already percolating the virus in their body.
[03:22:21.638 --> 03:22:23.199]  Too late.
[03:22:23.199 --> 03:22:24.120]  Can't contain it.
[03:22:24.120 --> 03:22:24.880]  Can't stop it.
[03:22:25.512 --> 03:22:40.386]  But if you isolate them, then you simply postpone the day when you let them out of jail and then the virus would begin to re-escalate and jump and spread all over the place again.
[03:22:40.386 --> 03:22:42.048]  So that doesn't work at all.
[03:22:42.048 --> 03:22:44.731]  None of the containment measures work.
[03:22:44.731 --> 03:22:50.236]  Again, what works is natural exposure of everybody, period.
[03:22:51.477 --> 03:23:15.613]  So if you accept the mainstream idea, which I do not, but I visit that world in order to point out its internal illogic and inconsistency, if you buy the pandemic idea and the virus spreading idea, there's only one thing to conclude.
[03:23:15.613 --> 03:23:20.636]  Open the economy completely, never lock it down, forget distancing, forget masks,
[03:23:21.377 --> 03:23:26.139]  Expose the entire population and be done with it.
[03:23:26.139 --> 03:23:28.460]  Period.
[03:23:28.460 --> 03:23:33.402]  If that had been done, people would be talking about another flu season.
[03:23:33.402 --> 03:23:35.503]  That's what they would be saying.
[03:23:35.503 --> 03:23:38.924]  Oh yeah, we had a pretty severe flu season, etc, etc.
[03:23:38.924 --> 03:23:41.605]  Of course, nobody locked down anybody.
[03:23:41.605 --> 03:23:42.766]  Everybody went to work.
[03:23:42.766 --> 03:23:44.566]  The economy kept rolling.
[03:23:44.566 --> 03:23:48.168]  But you see, that's not the operation.
[03:23:48.723 --> 03:23:50.504]  That's not the covert op.
[03:23:50.504 --> 03:23:53.745]  That's not what the globalists are really after.
[03:23:53.745 --> 03:24:02.428]  What the Rockefeller-Gage globalists are really after is destroying the world in order to save it.
[03:24:02.428 --> 03:24:07.370]  Wrecking the economies in order to bring in a new technocratic fascism.
[03:24:07.370 --> 03:24:10.372]  That's what they're really all about.
[03:24:10.372 --> 03:24:11.332]  Okay.
[03:24:11.332 --> 03:24:11.812]  Okay.
[03:24:11.812 --> 03:24:12.332]  Okay.
[03:24:12.332 --> 03:24:13.893]  And moving right along here.
[03:24:16.354 --> 03:24:37.927]  Under-reported in the press, in America certainly, we have the fact that last weekend protests, or one protest in Berlin, was attended by, estimates vary, but I would peg it at somewhere between 300,000 and 500,000 people in one place in Berlin.
[03:24:43.962 --> 03:25:04.594]  Protesting the entire operation of the destruction of the economy, the lockdowns, all of the measures that have put Germany, as well as just about every other country in the world, teetering on the edge of collapse.
[03:25:04.594 --> 03:25:07.456]  That's what this protest was about.
[03:25:07.456 --> 03:25:13.219]  Of course, in certain mainstream outlets, they will say, well, 17,000, we think maybe that much
[03:25:13.903 --> 03:25:15.543]  Absolutely not.
[03:25:15.543 --> 03:25:17.764]  Absolutely not.
[03:25:17.764 --> 03:25:29.906]  And this was a peaceful demonstration on the part of between three to five hundred thousand people in one place in Berlin.
[03:25:29.906 --> 03:25:39.727]  And from what I have been hearing, reports of multiple clashes with the police are not true.
[03:25:39.727 --> 03:25:42.488]  In fact, the police, in many cases,
[03:25:43.211 --> 03:25:53.380]  We're helping the demonstrators get organized, get put in place adequately, and so on and so forth.
[03:25:53.380 --> 03:25:55.842]  People were not wearing masks, by and large.
[03:25:55.842 --> 03:25:57.144]  They were not distancing.
[03:25:57.144 --> 03:25:58.285]  They were all together.
[03:25:58.285 --> 03:26:01.768]  They were saying absolutely no to all of this.
[03:26:01.768 --> 03:26:08.914]  Well, naturally, the mainstream media are not going to highlight this because it's a breakout.
[03:26:08.914 --> 03:26:09.755]  It's a breakthrough.
[03:26:11.221 --> 03:26:17.845]  It's evidence that massive numbers of people are saying, no, we don't want this.
[03:26:17.845 --> 03:26:20.646]  We're not going to stand for it.
[03:26:20.646 --> 03:26:39.457]  We understand this is fascism, brutality, totalitarian state being carried out against us under the cover story of a virus, under the cover story of a pandemic, under the false narrative
[03:26:43.186 --> 03:26:45.147]  Waking up time, folks.
[03:26:45.147 --> 03:26:48.709]  Waking up time.
[03:26:48.709 --> 03:26:54.913]  So let's get to the CDC definition of a COVID-19 case.
[03:26:54.913 --> 03:27:00.936]  I mentioned this last week and it bears repeating.
[03:27:00.936 --> 03:27:02.657]  If you read the April 2020 CDC
[03:27:08.037 --> 03:27:18.584]  Uh, spaghetti, what I would call spaghetti definition of a COVID-19 case, because it has five sets of criteria.
[03:27:18.584 --> 03:27:26.409]  It's this or that, if this, that, you know, one of those ridiculous, complex things.
[03:27:26.409 --> 03:27:36.436]  You come out with the understanding that virtually anybody can be diagnosed as COVID-19 without any kind of test.
[03:27:37.159 --> 03:27:38.900]  Whatsoever.
[03:27:38.900 --> 03:27:41.182]  That's right.
[03:27:41.182 --> 03:27:48.308]  As ridiculous as the tests are, you don't even need them to make the diagnosis.
[03:27:48.308 --> 03:28:06.523]  For example, chills and fever or cough, if taken together where the person is said to be in contact with a cohort
[03:28:07.185 --> 03:28:13.328]  Which is at risk, as pronounced by public health authorities.
[03:28:13.328 --> 03:28:18.791]  If you satisfy those conditions, you could be diagnosed as COVID-19.
[03:28:18.791 --> 03:28:23.653]  Chills and fever or a cough.
[03:28:23.653 --> 03:28:24.194]  Huh?
[03:28:24.194 --> 03:28:24.674]  What?
[03:28:24.674 --> 03:28:25.154]  Who?
[03:28:25.154 --> 03:28:25.514]  It?
[03:28:25.514 --> 03:28:26.595]  What?
[03:28:26.595 --> 03:28:28.476]  That's right.
[03:28:28.476 --> 03:28:32.738]  No test of any kind.
[03:28:32.738 --> 03:28:36.540]  So with all the fiddling and diddling that we've been
[03:28:37.438 --> 03:28:47.644]  Describing for weeks and actually months now about how the test case numbers are being cooked and faked and so on and so forth.
[03:28:47.644 --> 03:28:58.370]  Here you have it embedded in the very definition, the official definition by the CDC of a COVID-19 case.
[03:28:58.370 --> 03:29:00.090]  It's engraved in stone.
[03:29:00.090 --> 03:29:02.412]  It's institutionalized.
[03:29:02.412 --> 03:29:04.453]  It becomes available to any
[03:29:05.345 --> 03:29:15.153]  Medical personnel to use on a patient, in an office, in a hospital, in a nursing home, anywhere.
[03:29:15.153 --> 03:29:19.256]  And then, of course, it becomes part of the count.
[03:29:19.256 --> 03:29:32.807]  The official count of case numbers, death numbers, which is trumpeted by the media 24-7 to scare the population and make them afraid to go into lockdown mode.
[03:29:33.467 --> 03:29:43.789]  distancing mode, mask mode, etc, etc, etc, which prolongs the economic devastation.
[03:29:43.789 --> 03:29:58.452]  So that is the CDC definition of a COVID-19 case, which is stunning, if you would just give it a few moments of thought.
[03:29:58.452 --> 03:30:00.512]  Okay, next up,
[03:30:03.288 --> 03:30:07.572]  The Director of the CDC, Robert Redfield.
[03:30:07.572 --> 03:30:12.696]  Story today that I've run on No More Fake News.
[03:30:12.696 --> 03:30:16.679]  Details his sordid past.
[03:30:16.679 --> 03:30:20.783]  Now keep in mind that Redfield is now the Director of the CDC.
[03:30:20.783 --> 03:30:28.309]  Their main business activity is promoting and selling vaccines, which will apply certainly to
[03:30:29.355 --> 03:30:35.568]  The COVID-19 vaccine whenever it is approved for use.
[03:30:35.568 --> 03:30:40.358]  And he is also a key member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force.
[03:30:42.048 --> 03:30:53.138]  Vicki Gibbs, 57-year-old lesbian preacher in Houston, went in with a cough, got intubated, and then died.
[03:30:53.138 --> 03:30:58.943]  And as soon as I saw her face, as soon as I saw the report, I said, watch, it'll be intubation.
[03:30:58.943 --> 03:31:00.284]  We know what's gonna happen.
[03:31:00.284 --> 03:31:01.686]  It's a blue city.
[03:31:01.686 --> 03:31:02.907]  Same story yet again.
[03:31:02.907 --> 03:31:04.888]  And they say her heart gave out.
[03:31:05.849 --> 03:31:10.790]  If you put somebody on a breathing tube of COVID-19 as a death sentence, it's on record.
[03:31:10.790 --> 03:31:13.431]  Warn everyone you know before they go into the hospital and get killed.
[03:31:13.431 --> 03:31:17.032]  Why are almost all the deaths happening in blue cities and blue states?
[03:31:17.032 --> 03:31:23.974]  It's because they intubate them, putting a tube in their lungs, and COVID-19 is causing an autoimmune response.
[03:31:23.974 --> 03:31:28.095]  And if you do that with oxygen, the doctors are on record saying it will kill you.
[03:31:28.775 --> 03:31:33.437]  But all these doctors in blue cities and blue states follow their orders.
[03:31:33.437 --> 03:31:37.478]  And the minute I saw this report today, I knew what I would be reading.
[03:31:37.478 --> 03:31:41.580]  Don't end up like Vicki Gibbs or everyone.
[03:31:41.580 --> 03:31:46.222]  There are a lot of signs that people are really waking up to the new world order and global government.
[03:31:46.222 --> 03:31:49.343]  But one of the biggest is privacy pouches.
[03:31:49.343 --> 03:31:52.244]  I've been selling these for more than 10 years.
[03:31:52.244 --> 03:31:54.325]  In the old days, they weren't 100% effective.
[03:31:54.325 --> 03:31:55.185]  Now they are.
[03:31:55.185 --> 03:31:57.946]  They're little bitty, lightweight Faraday cages that
[03:31:58.146 --> 03:31:58.686]  I think so.
[03:32:21.195 --> 03:32:23.818]  Well, I gotta tell you, normally we probably sold a couple hundred a month.
[03:32:23.818 --> 03:32:27.362]  We're selling upwards of a thousand of these a day.
[03:32:27.362 --> 03:32:29.544]  Plus, we have a good unit and it's also a good price.

[03:33:45.316 --> 03:33:48.699]  It's less than 90 days out from the historic election.
[03:33:48.699 --> 03:34:04.313]  The CHICOMS, the EU, Hollywood, the Democratic Party, and the blue states and blue cities are all battling to keep America shut down and to destroy free speech as well to ensure their final takeover of the United States by removing President Donald John Trump.
[03:34:04.313 --> 03:34:06.475]  At InfoWars, we're fighting back harder than ever.

[03:35:00.622 --> 03:35:05.085]  And we're back here talking about Robert Redfield.
[03:35:05.085 --> 03:35:13.189]  So he is also a key member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, as well as the head of the CDC.
[03:35:13.189 --> 03:35:20.874]  And as everybody knows, the task force is intent on bringing a vaccine for COVID-19 to market.
[03:35:20.874 --> 03:35:26.737]  So he is in a key position to promote that vaccine.
[03:35:28.038 --> 03:35:35.784]  Well, I ran into this guy way back in the day when I was writing my first book, AIDS, Inc.
[03:35:35.784 --> 03:35:46.411]  and followed part of his career when he was in the Army doing research on an AIDS vaccine.
[03:35:46.411 --> 03:35:48.153]  He was a joke.
[03:35:48.153 --> 03:35:50.394]  He still is a joke.
[03:35:50.394 --> 03:35:52.696]  And the Army knew about it.
[03:35:52.696 --> 03:35:56.979]  And today I published an article with a long letter, excerpts from the letter,
[03:35:58.090 --> 03:36:23.853]  Sent to Congressman Henry Waxman, this is years ago, about Redfield and his preposterous handling of that research on a purported AIDS vaccine, where he was accused of faking data, massaging data, corrupting data, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, in order to push the idea of that AIDS vaccine.
[03:36:25.086 --> 03:36:29.989]  The Army investigators were aware of this and they made it known.
[03:36:29.989 --> 03:36:41.797]  But finally, the Army let him off the hook and then began his rise to political power as a medical bureaucrat.
[03:36:41.797 --> 03:36:50.142]  And this is the guy who is standing next to Fauci in the forefront of pushing a COVID-19 vaccine on the population.
[03:36:53.715 --> 03:36:55.096]  Trust him then?
[03:36:55.096 --> 03:36:56.517]  Absolutely not.
[03:36:56.517 --> 03:36:58.018]  Trust him now?
[03:36:58.018 --> 03:37:01.380]  You'd be crazy to.
[03:37:01.380 --> 03:37:03.181]  Heed this warning.
[03:37:03.181 --> 03:37:21.934]  Understand what this guy did years ago in relation to a vaccine and now the position that he is in to be able to promote, sell, even possibly mandate a vaccine for COVID-19 to the public.
[03:37:23.746 --> 03:37:38.252]  And of course, I should mention that the task force's favorite company, because there are a number of them testing these vaccines right now, seems to be Moderna.
[03:37:38.252 --> 03:37:42.154]  Moderna?
[03:37:42.154 --> 03:37:52.338]  This is a company, a very small company, that's never brought a drug or vaccine or any product to the market ever before.
[03:37:53.576 --> 03:37:56.758]  Ever, ever, ever.
[03:37:56.758 --> 03:38:05.442]  And yet, they have garnered roughly half a billion dollars in federal money for research.
[03:38:05.442 --> 03:38:09.183]  Half a billion.
[03:38:09.183 --> 03:38:11.604]  Fauci likes them.
[03:38:11.604 --> 03:38:14.266]  The task force seems to like them.
[03:38:14.266 --> 03:38:15.826]  Why?
[03:38:15.826 --> 03:38:19.348]  Because Moderna is pushing an RNA vaccine.
[03:38:20.265 --> 03:38:31.210]  A technology which has never been licensed for public use before and could gain the market now.
[03:38:31.210 --> 03:38:35.572]  Why hasn't it gained any approval or certification before?
[03:38:35.572 --> 03:38:36.592]  People have tried.
[03:38:36.592 --> 03:38:44.916]  The answer is obvious because it's caused serious problems in volunteers in clinical trials.
[03:38:46.698 --> 03:38:59.746]  Mostly under the heading of autoimmune response, which means the body basically attacks itself as if the body were an enemy of the body.
[03:38:59.746 --> 03:39:12.053]  And yet, these people want to foist an RNA vaccine on the public as manufactured by Moderna.
[03:39:12.053 --> 03:39:13.614]  There is another hidden motive
[03:39:14.443 --> 03:39:18.986]  for Bill Gates and Fauci and others behind this.
[03:39:18.986 --> 03:39:31.075]  Once they can get RNA technology approved and into the marketplace for the first time, then they've broken the ice.
[03:39:31.075 --> 03:39:35.338]  Then they can say, we can now use this for any vaccine.
[03:39:35.338 --> 03:39:37.540]  And why is that important to them?
[03:39:37.540 --> 03:39:42.303]  Because the manufacturing process is much quicker and easier and cheaper.
[03:39:43.971 --> 03:39:57.258]  So for the next 50 vaccine viruses that they claim to have discovered out of the blue, they can immediately turn around and say, well, we can have a vaccine ready in three or four months.
[03:39:57.258 --> 03:40:03.581]  Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, because it's going to be an RNA vaccine and we can make it very quickly.
[03:40:03.581 --> 03:40:11.846]  And that means they want to continually shoot up people with all manner of toxic elements and substances
[03:40:12.552 --> 03:40:16.395]  From here on into the future.
[03:40:16.395 --> 03:40:30.363]  And if you really want to get technical about it, not science fiction, but technical, you would be talking about nano vaccine.
[03:40:30.363 --> 03:40:39.129]  The implantation of tiny, tiny, tiny particles that have been found by researchers in Italy
[03:40:40.160 --> 03:40:50.367]  I reported on this, to be contaminating already many, many mainstream vaccines by the biggest manufacturers in the world.
[03:40:50.367 --> 03:41:03.555]  Here you would have nanoparticles intentionally placed in vaccines that would function in the body as both broadcasters of data
[03:41:04.207 --> 03:41:12.113]  From the body out and receivers of data or instructions into the body and the brain.
[03:41:12.113 --> 03:41:16.477]  That is the holy grail of nano research.
[03:41:16.477 --> 03:41:18.698]  To be able to do this.
[03:41:18.698 --> 03:41:20.580]  In other words.
[03:41:20.580 --> 03:41:27.946]  To have a real-time surveillance of every human from inside that human's body.
[03:41:27.946 --> 03:41:30.888]  Okay?
[03:41:30.888 --> 03:41:31.749]  And also to
[03:41:33.592 --> 03:41:58.982]  Broadcast and plant instructions from the outside to that human through these nanosensors in the body, thereby changing behavior, changing response to stimuli, changing all sorts of factors about humans.
[03:41:58.982 --> 03:42:01.463]  That's where this is going.
[03:42:01.463 --> 03:42:02.824]  That's what it's all about.
[03:42:03.942 --> 03:42:16.071]  Because the vaccine is a convenient excuse for injecting or spraying depending upon the route of transmission.
[03:42:16.071 --> 03:42:19.453]  All manner of substances into the body
[03:42:20.311 --> 03:42:28.036]  Under the false heading of, it's wonderful for you, it'll heal, it'll prevent, all kinds of good things will happen.
[03:42:28.036 --> 03:42:34.980]  And you must have it, of course, because this is a way to gain immunity to COVID-19.
[03:42:34.980 --> 03:42:39.602]  Horror story, horror story, horror story, solution, solution, solution.
[03:42:39.602 --> 03:42:40.943]  Understand?
[03:42:40.943 --> 03:42:43.785]  Get this?
[03:42:43.785 --> 03:42:47.747]  This is the Holy Grail of medical dictatorship.
[03:42:48.740 --> 03:43:11.410]  To have control of the population to such a degree that a vaccine can be literally sold to 7 billion people as being necessary, where people will line up around the block a dozen times in order to just get it and believe that they are now protected from something, when that is obviously not the case.
[03:43:11.410 --> 03:43:15.932]  And to return to what I was saying at the top here of this hour,
[03:43:18.152 --> 03:43:28.257]  If you go into the insane world where so many people believe that there is this unique virus loose in the world, and how do you gain immunity from that?
[03:43:28.257 --> 03:43:35.820]  Forget about the whole idea of vaccination, even if you buy vaccination theory, which I don't.
[03:43:35.820 --> 03:43:47.306]  Because conventional researchers are now reporting that so-called immunity from COVID-19, which they measure in terms of antibody response,
[03:43:47.998 --> 03:43:52.059]  Wanes and declines very quickly in people.
[03:43:52.059 --> 03:43:56.941]  Therefore, we're not even talking about a one-shot vaccine for the population.
[03:43:56.941 --> 03:44:02.442]  We're talking about something on the order of the flu vaccine that would have to have boosters every year.
[03:44:02.442 --> 03:44:03.422]  Are you kidding?
[03:44:03.422 --> 03:44:05.603]  It's not even vaguely doable.
[03:44:05.603 --> 03:44:12.625]  You're going to inoculate or somehow inflict a vaccine on 7 billion people every year?
[03:44:12.625 --> 03:44:13.085]  Forget it!
[03:44:14.835 --> 03:44:20.916]  In addition to the fact of how is the flu vaccine working out as a comparison?
[03:44:20.916 --> 03:44:30.039]  Every year, according to official statistics, at any rate, we're talking about millions of cases all over the world and hundreds of thousands of deaths.
[03:44:30.039 --> 03:44:32.599]  So that's not working at all.
[03:44:32.599 --> 03:44:38.921]  And why would we expect anything different from a conventional or otherwise COVID-19 vaccine?
[03:44:40.274 --> 03:44:51.359]  So as far as the, you know, dumbed-down conventional hope of attaining immunity to COVID-19 from a vaccine, forget about it.
[03:44:51.359 --> 03:44:52.219]  It's ridiculous.
[03:44:52.219 --> 03:44:53.339]  It's insane.
[03:44:53.339 --> 03:44:54.420]  It doesn't add up.
[03:44:54.420 --> 03:44:58.101]  It's meaningless.
[03:44:58.101 --> 03:44:59.942]  It's a pipe dream.
[03:44:59.942 --> 03:45:02.463]  A twisted pipe dream.
[03:45:02.463 --> 03:45:08.325]  Even in conventional terms.
[03:45:08.325 --> 03:45:09.826]  This is what happened, you see.
[03:45:10.475 --> 03:45:12.518]  And I'll wrap it up here.
[03:45:12.518 --> 03:45:22.631]  When you visit the insane world where people are absolutely convinced that a virus is loose in the world and it's killing all kinds of people.
[03:45:22.631 --> 03:45:28.138]  When you look at that closely, there's all kinds of insane contradictions in that viewpoint.
[03:45:28.138 --> 03:45:30.221]  It doesn't mean anything.
[03:45:30.221 --> 03:45:30.662]  We're done.
