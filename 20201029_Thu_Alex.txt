[00:00.000 --> 00:26.600]  Four more years of Georgia, Georgia, we are going to find ourselves in a position where
[00:26.600 --> 00:34.000]  President Trump's devastation, devastation of Joe Biden.
[00:34.000 --> 00:40.240]  He has secured an even bigger landslide victory that I'm now just going to call it.
[00:40.240 --> 00:46.840]  Trump is going to win bigger than he won in 2016 in the Electoral College.
[00:46.840 --> 00:49.840]  He might even win the popular vote, though that's the state where they've got so much
[00:49.840 --> 00:52.120]  election fraud going on.
[00:52.120 --> 01:02.680]  We have put together, I think, the most extensive and inclusive voter fraud organization in
[01:02.680 --> 01:05.480]  the history of American politics.
[01:05.480 --> 01:10.400]  As Biden supporters nudge towards their man's rally, they're goaded by President Trump's
[01:10.400 --> 01:17.880]  most loyal.
[01:17.880 --> 01:20.920]  But just as sure as the sun came up this morning and it'll set this evening, you can
[01:20.920 --> 01:27.000]  bet your bottom, Benjamin Franklin, or your bottom, George Washington, or your bottom,
[01:27.000 --> 01:32.320]  Thomas Jefferson, you can bet your bottom, Greenback, that they're going to contest
[01:32.320 --> 01:37.160]  it and have the states start breaking up and just have the biggest fiasco you've ever
[01:37.160 --> 01:38.160]  seen.
[01:38.160 --> 01:39.320]  They already said the last election was illegitimate.
[01:39.320 --> 01:42.480]  I believe he knows he's an illegitimate president.
[01:42.480 --> 01:43.480]  He knows.
[01:43.480 --> 01:50.200]  He knows that there were a bunch of different reasons why the election turned out the way
[01:50.200 --> 01:51.200]  it did.
[01:51.200 --> 01:54.720]  And now they're saying if Trump fights them doing that, he's contesting the election.
[01:54.720 --> 01:57.120]  And they're saying you're not allowed to contest.
[01:57.120 --> 02:00.120]  We contested four years ago with no evidence.
[02:00.120 --> 02:02.800]  Now we're going to contest, but you can't fight back.
[02:02.800 --> 02:06.960]  President Trump is deepening the threat of a constitutional crisis after the November
[02:06.960 --> 02:07.960]  election.
[02:07.960 --> 02:12.480]  He has refused to promise that he'll leave office peacefully if defeated.
[02:12.480 --> 02:17.160]  And once he is out of office, the senators can't help him, even if they're Republicans
[02:17.160 --> 02:22.280]  may obtain a majority in the Senate, he's going to be in the hands of the courts.
[02:22.280 --> 02:24.520]  And it does appear that there's going to be plenty to follow up.
[02:24.520 --> 02:27.880]  He'll be, if he's not in prison, he'll be in the courts for years.
[02:27.880 --> 02:34.800]  So I really believe that Donald Trump is stonewalling on taking effective measures to prevent our
[02:34.800 --> 02:38.000]  electoral system because he wants Russian help.
[02:38.000 --> 02:39.760]  Like he'd take Chinese help.
[02:39.760 --> 02:42.400]  He'd take help from Albanian folks singers.
[02:42.400 --> 02:47.600]  He is desperate to win, and by the way, if he doesn't win in 2020, you're going to see
[02:47.600 --> 02:51.160]  the ugliest departure from the White House in American history.
[02:51.160 --> 02:55.800]  And folks, they're going to hit, listen to this prediction and maybe you'll stop them
[02:55.800 --> 03:01.240]  from doing it, but they're going to hit the infrastructure, the power grid, the cell phones
[03:01.240 --> 03:03.480]  and not just the internet.
[03:03.480 --> 03:05.840]  And they're going to say that the Russians did it.
[03:05.840 --> 03:09.600]  Whereas if you actually hear what the NSA and the CIA and the Director of National tells
[03:09.600 --> 03:14.720]  us to sing, and I know it's true because we have industrial level defense systems that
[03:14.720 --> 03:19.160]  we use that are amongst the largest companies in the world.
[03:19.160 --> 03:20.160]  And it's all Chinese.
[03:20.160 --> 03:24.360]  I mean, Russia, it doesn't even just doesn't even gauge.
[03:24.360 --> 03:30.480]  China is not hiding the fact that they are hammering the living snot out of US companies.
[03:30.480 --> 03:34.840]  And so NSA comes out and says, warning all Americans, we're being hit by communist Chinese
[03:34.840 --> 03:37.360]  millions are having their identity stolen a day.
[03:37.360 --> 03:38.360]  Watch out.
[03:38.360 --> 03:39.360]  Check your cards.
[03:39.360 --> 03:40.360]  Cancel them immediately.
[03:40.360 --> 03:41.520]  We're having a problem.
[03:41.520 --> 03:42.520]  Beware.
[03:42.520 --> 03:44.200]  They're hacking into home appliances.
[03:44.200 --> 03:45.200]  Beware.
[03:45.200 --> 03:46.200]  They're hacking into the cell towers.
[03:46.200 --> 03:47.200]  Beware.
[03:47.200 --> 03:52.200]  And then you get this article out of AP, US, when they say US, they mean Democrats, Russian
[03:52.200 --> 03:55.000]  hackers targeting state local networks.
[03:55.000 --> 03:57.800]  Oh, yes, the Russians.
[03:57.800 --> 03:59.840]  The Russians, they're the ones.
[03:59.840 --> 04:02.400]  No, it's the chikoms.
[04:02.400 --> 04:05.360]  And of course the Russians are probing things and doing that.
[04:05.360 --> 04:06.360]  Everyone is.
[04:06.360 --> 04:08.440]  And Russia is an adversary at many levels.
[04:08.440 --> 04:11.880]  No one will ever deny that we're an adversary with them or an adversary with us.
[04:11.880 --> 04:16.240]  But China is the big thousand pound bully.
[04:16.240 --> 04:20.800]  I'll work as hard for those who don't support me as those should do, including those chumps
[04:20.800 --> 04:23.000]  of the microphone out there.
[04:23.000 --> 04:28.440]  Look, when I talk about the Democratic Party, I don't mean the evil chikom globalist operatives
[04:28.440 --> 04:29.440]  that run it.
[04:29.440 --> 04:32.720]  I mean, the average Democrat out there is either a Stockholm syndrome woman that just
[04:32.720 --> 04:38.240]  is totally scared of what they're told, or it's a sniveling pedophile degenerate type
[04:38.240 --> 04:39.240]  that hates America.
[04:39.240 --> 05:00.760]  They're just stupid, very stupid people.
[05:00.760 --> 05:04.960]  There are many references in the Holy Bible to the mustard seed.
[05:04.960 --> 05:05.960]  And why is that?
[05:05.960 --> 05:10.760]  It's one of the tiniest seeds out there, but a giant tree like bush grows from it that
[05:10.760 --> 05:14.280]  produces more mustard seeds.
[05:14.280 --> 05:18.400]  Mustard was known by the ancients around the world to have amazing health effects.
[05:18.400 --> 05:19.400]  They didn't know why.
[05:19.400 --> 05:24.560]  Well, with modern science, we know it's one of the purest, cleanest, organic forms of
[05:24.560 --> 05:26.060]  selenium.
[05:26.060 --> 05:33.920]  We have bio true selenium sold out for months back in stock at infowarsstore.com at 50% off
[05:33.920 --> 05:37.800]  store ride free shipping and triple patriot points.
[05:37.800 --> 05:44.760]  Bio true selenium at infowarsstore.com is an amazing product, and it's even more amazing
[05:44.760 --> 05:46.560]  in that it funds our operation.
[05:46.560 --> 05:49.520]  But if you don't know about selenium, research it.
[05:49.520 --> 05:53.680]  It is an essential nutrient in the body that you've actually have to have.
[05:53.680 --> 06:19.160]  It's back in stock 50% off triple patriot points at infowarsstore.com and with free
[06:19.160 --> 06:22.280]  shipping.
[06:22.280 --> 06:28.360]  In short days until the most historic election in world history, I'm Alex Jones coming to
[06:28.360 --> 06:33.120]  you from deep in the heart of Texas and defiance of globalist tyranny and censorship.
[06:33.120 --> 06:36.040]  Very proud and honored to be here today.
[06:36.040 --> 06:37.680]  Wow.
[06:37.680 --> 06:39.600]  Talk about the worm turning.
[06:39.600 --> 06:47.640]  I got some very interesting phone calls last night from individuals at the highest levels
[06:47.640 --> 06:50.560]  of corporate governance in the world.
[06:50.560 --> 06:52.040]  You know, I've gotten calls from the president.
[06:52.040 --> 06:54.240]  I've gotten calls from it's not about how important I am.
[06:54.240 --> 06:58.400]  It's about how important this information is, but I got some very high level corporate
[06:58.400 --> 07:00.120]  governance calls.
[07:00.120 --> 07:05.280]  I got super high level media calls right before I went on air, and they're all basically
[07:05.280 --> 07:09.760]  telling me the same thing, but Chinese communists are being rolled up.
[07:09.760 --> 07:12.880]  The Democrat networks that sold the country out are in deep trouble and there's a total
[07:12.880 --> 07:18.520]  panic happening right now inside the power structure as many people that weren't Chai
[07:18.520 --> 07:24.520]  Com agents, but went along with it, decided to flip sides over to America.
[07:24.520 --> 07:28.680]  So we are living in incredible times, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm just extremely honored
[07:28.680 --> 07:29.680]  to be here.
[07:29.680 --> 07:30.680]  It does not mean we're out of the woods.
[07:30.680 --> 07:34.960]  It does not mean the deep state won't set off a nuke or something and blow Trump up.
[07:34.960 --> 07:38.480]  I mean, anything is possible.
[07:38.480 --> 07:43.240]  If I was them, I wouldn't do this, but if I was them, it doesn't mean if I was them,
[07:43.240 --> 07:44.240]  I would do this.
[07:44.240 --> 07:46.760]  It means knowing their psychology, knowing their background, knowing what they're capable
[07:46.760 --> 07:51.980]  of, when they fail, they don't tend to give up because they haven't been held accountable.
[07:51.980 --> 07:55.920]  They would hit the power grid of the stock market, which you saw happening yesterday
[07:55.920 --> 07:57.440]  and the power grid is getting hit.
[07:57.440 --> 08:00.960]  Lots of power out of just lots of hacking going on the NSA confirms that.
[08:00.960 --> 08:06.920]  So this country is under 21st century war and we're under the whole COVID hysteria that
[08:06.920 --> 08:11.760]  was launched in China, launched by our media, Macron has announced another even more draconian
[08:11.760 --> 08:15.920]  lockdown where all restaurants are completely closed, businesses are completely closed unless
[08:15.920 --> 08:17.560]  you're a mega corporation.
[08:17.560 --> 08:18.560]  You stay open.
[08:18.560 --> 08:20.760]  Governor Newsom is announcing similar things.
[08:20.760 --> 08:26.480]  The Democrats and the globalist collaborators worldwide are bringing us under total siege
[08:26.480 --> 08:28.240]  and martial law.
[08:28.240 --> 08:29.580]  We have all of that.
[08:29.580 --> 08:38.000]  We have huge Hunter Biden, Burisma, Ukraine treason, Russia treason, China treason news
[08:38.000 --> 08:39.760]  breaking.
[08:39.760 --> 08:47.640]  We have massive election fraud news confirmed FBI actually arresting people, folks being
[08:47.640 --> 08:50.880]  brought in for questioning all across the country.
[08:50.880 --> 08:54.760]  They're catching with Democrats red handed.
[08:54.760 --> 09:02.480]  It is a operation like shooting fish in a barrel because Democrats are so corrupt, so
[09:02.480 --> 09:06.960]  evil, so out of control that you just randomly go anywhere with a hidden camera.
[09:06.960 --> 09:11.160]  You're engaged in criminal activity and bragging about because criminals love to brag for
[09:11.160 --> 09:12.480]  whatever reason.
[09:12.480 --> 09:15.120]  So there you go.
[09:15.120 --> 09:16.120]  That's all coming up.
[09:16.120 --> 09:21.200]  We have a bunch of big guests as well on the transmission.
[09:21.200 --> 09:24.840]  Ted Nugent is going to be popping in towards the last half hour of the next hour.
[09:24.840 --> 09:31.200]  Carlos Zapata very well spoken smart Patriot leader veteran with a associate of his.
[09:31.200 --> 09:36.640]  He thinks we should really meet Terry Raposa will be joining us in the third hour and Matt
[09:36.640 --> 09:41.480]  Bracken former Navy SEAL amazing political analyst and bestselling author will also
[09:41.480 --> 09:46.080]  be joining us coming up the fourth hour ahead of the war room of the one, the only Owen
[09:46.080 --> 09:47.080]  Schreuer.
[09:47.080 --> 09:50.760]  And then of course, we have info wars.
[09:50.760 --> 09:53.800]  Election countdown seven to nine PM central live as well.
[09:53.800 --> 09:58.520]  There is so much to get into, you know, my hair isn't even combed.
[09:58.520 --> 10:04.840]  I didn't even put on a sports jacket and a button up shirt because I respect the show
[10:04.840 --> 10:12.760]  like I normally do because I was so busy right up until we went live with just huge breaking
[10:12.760 --> 10:13.760]  news.
[10:13.760 --> 10:18.320]  So normally a talk show host sits in their studio for 20, 30 minutes just focusing before
[10:18.320 --> 10:19.320]  they go live.
[10:19.320 --> 10:23.480]  I do that as well, but I had no chance that I'm not complaining.
[10:23.480 --> 10:27.960]  I'm just trying to reset here with all the data I've gotten all the intel I've gotten.
[10:27.960 --> 10:33.240]  You notice I came out yesterday and I said that Hunter Biden laptop and other criminal
[10:33.240 --> 10:39.240]  info has been given over 40 major media institutions and that a lot of them never get it because
[10:39.240 --> 10:44.960]  the UPS, the FedEx, the USPS is being broken into the data is being stolen and that's
[10:44.960 --> 10:51.120]  being officially confirmed by the security companies and the security inside of major
[10:51.120 --> 10:52.280]  shipping companies.
[10:52.280 --> 10:59.960]  Told you that at 1110 yesterday, 10 minutes into the show, Tucker Carlson let us show
[10:59.960 --> 11:05.760]  with it last night that they're breaking into their stuff and stealing their mail and that
[11:05.760 --> 11:10.560]  they're grabbing all the data of of course I'm just letting you know here that we're
[11:10.560 --> 11:12.720]  not making stuff up around here.
[11:12.720 --> 11:19.800]  Now the magnitude of the information I have is so massive that I'm not choking right
[11:19.800 --> 11:30.120]  now in here, I am processing it, but let's just say it's crazy town right now and there
[11:30.120 --> 11:34.480]  are all these people that went along with the system, they knew it was criminal but
[11:34.480 --> 11:37.600]  they were scared of it and they thought that if they just went along with it they'd be
[11:37.600 --> 11:38.600]  safe.
[11:38.600 --> 11:43.000]  Now all these followers that have been going along with the system because they thought
[11:43.000 --> 11:46.680]  it was going to win are panicking and we've reached that point of tipping.
[11:46.680 --> 11:54.360]  We're like in the old images of the ancient battles with the Romans, you know, battling
[11:54.360 --> 12:00.200]  the Egyptians or the Babylonians, babbling the Israelites or so many examples of that
[12:00.200 --> 12:08.920]  are Allied forces fighting the Nazis in Normandy, there's a point where the tide turns and the
[12:08.920 --> 12:15.800]  other army starts getting pushed back and then as they get routed they begin to flee
[12:15.800 --> 12:21.360]  and we've passed the tipping point where it was right there on the nice edge the last
[12:21.360 --> 12:26.160]  few years and now it's collapsing in on the enemy.
[12:26.160 --> 12:33.080]  Now they're going to pull some crazy stuff, you can bet your bottom green back on that
[12:33.080 --> 12:39.440]  and I'd be praying to Jesus as much as you can Yahweh, Jehovah, whatever name you pray
[12:39.440 --> 12:42.680]  to, we all know the Holy Spirit, the same God, the God of life, the God of Genesis,
[12:42.680 --> 12:48.720]  the God of Abraham, the God of justice, but this is a historic planet alignment and I
[12:48.720 --> 12:57.640]  mean that not literally but metaphysically, allegorically that the planets are aligning
[12:57.640 --> 13:02.880]  right now and folks have choose what side they're on and there were those that got threatened
[13:02.880 --> 13:08.920]  and those that got intimidated that got scared and joined the Sauron, another archetypal
[13:08.920 --> 13:14.120]  name for the devil, but there are those of us that chose to not go down that path and
[13:14.120 --> 13:19.400]  so all I can tell you is the battle is now on and it's an intense time.
[13:19.400 --> 13:23.440]  I'm going to come back and I'm going to choose what I'm going to hit first because there's
[13:23.440 --> 13:28.280]  so much so the real broadcast will start when we come back in four minutes but let me just
[13:28.280 --> 13:30.200]  do this or we won't be here.
[13:30.200 --> 13:35.920]  It's a funny phenomenon when we have the biggest traffic to infowars.com and newswars.com and
[13:35.920 --> 13:40.920]  band.video and electionnight.news, the uncensored link right now, you can find all those censored
[13:40.920 --> 13:43.000]  videos.
[13:43.000 --> 13:46.520]  We don't even sell enough product to fund our operation, it's crazy.
[13:46.520 --> 13:50.400]  It's the diehard listeners that buy the product to keep this on the air less than 1% of our
[13:50.400 --> 13:55.040]  audience and we love you and you are the folks that do it all, just as important as I am
[13:55.040 --> 13:57.240]  or anybody out there on the front lines.
[13:57.240 --> 13:58.240]  It's just crazy.
[13:58.240 --> 14:02.800]  We have record traffic, record bandwidth bills, you know, we're talking an extra 10 million
[14:02.800 --> 14:08.080]  views a week now at band.video on top of the 6-7 million we were getting, that's expensive
[14:08.080 --> 14:09.080]  and I'm not complaining.
[14:09.080 --> 14:12.280]  I'm just telling you, we're in the fight, we've proven our worthiness, we've proven
[14:12.280 --> 14:17.680]  that we won't back down and that we need to stay in the fight very humbly and I humbly
[14:17.680 --> 14:21.840]  ask you to go to infowars.com and take advantage of Black Friday in October.
[14:21.840 --> 14:24.440]  It ends in like three days.
[14:24.440 --> 14:30.640]  It's got to end because a lot of this stuff is going to sell out.
[14:30.640 --> 14:34.840]  Vitamin mineral fusion, free shipping, triple patriot points, 25% off, so good for your

[15:51.160 --> 15:55.520]  I get asked all the time by listeners and by the media, what am I most proud of when
[15:55.520 --> 15:59.920]  it comes to the show, and it's the fact that InvoWars more than 25 years ago doing basic
[15:59.920 --> 16:04.920]  research with what the club of Rome and the CFR and others were actually saying, developed
[16:04.920 --> 16:09.520]  the hypothesis that the Communist China had been set up to take our jobs and transfer
[16:09.520 --> 16:14.120]  them to China and then make us economically destitute and position us into debt, well
[16:14.120 --> 16:19.080]  now China owns the debt, now China owns Hollywood, all the one side of trading deals, it turns
[16:19.080 --> 16:24.320]  out our analysis was absolutely dead on, but again it wasn't that hard, the CFR and others
[16:24.320 --> 16:29.960]  admitted what they were doing, but still others didn't want to focus on that issue, we did,
[16:29.960 --> 16:33.600]  and you focused on it by supporting us at InvoWars.
[16:33.600 --> 16:37.520]  So when you go to infowarsstore.com and get all the great supplements, books, T-shirts,
[16:37.520 --> 16:41.640]  films, water filtration, air filtration, all of it, you're funding the organization that
[16:41.640 --> 16:45.560]  literally helped make up the world what's really happening, so that's a big accomplishment
[16:45.560 --> 16:51.120]  for all of you, I want to thank you for your support.
[16:51.120 --> 16:56.400]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left, it can be very stressful dealing
[16:56.400 --> 17:02.000]  with facts you refuse to accept, if you have a family member suffering from this degenerative
[17:02.000 --> 17:08.240]  mental condition, buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from infowarsstore.com, studies have
[17:08.240 --> 17:14.200]  suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease
[17:14.200 --> 17:19.800]  triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide a soothing reduction
[17:19.800 --> 17:24.560]  in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[17:24.560 --> 17:31.200]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function
[17:31.200 --> 17:35.800]  by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[17:35.800 --> 17:41.560]  It worked for my family, and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual
[17:41.560 --> 17:44.400]  facts that pertain to reality.
[17:44.400 --> 17:53.840]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself at infowarsstore.com.
[17:53.840 --> 18:08.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:08.520 --> 18:13.320]  Every major data stream, both public and panel, and on the street confirms Trump is about
[18:13.320 --> 18:16.760]  to win in a gigantic landslide.
[18:16.760 --> 18:22.840]  Enemy forces controlling the corporate show, because there is a war on your mind.
[18:22.840 --> 18:32.080]  Enemy forces controlling the mainstream media, the corporate establishment PR firms are going
[18:32.080 --> 18:36.840]  to say that Trump has lost and or that it's a contested election with mail-in ballots,
[18:36.840 --> 18:41.320]  and they're going to try to confuse the public and launch riots that are hundreds of times
[18:41.320 --> 18:42.760]  bigger than what you've already seen.
[18:42.760 --> 18:43.760]  But that is going to fail.
[18:43.760 --> 18:50.880]  And I'm your host, Alex Jones, on this live Thursday, October 29, 2020 transmission, four
[18:50.880 --> 18:55.280]  and a half days until election day, and we're going to be here seven days a week right through.
[18:55.280 --> 19:03.040]  We're going to be here on election night covering it, and I am predicting that it'll be overwhelming.
[19:03.040 --> 19:08.240]  The numbers will be clear that Trump has won, but the media will say that it's not clear,
[19:08.240 --> 19:11.920]  and again, it's going to contest, and the Clintons still running things that Obama are
[19:11.920 --> 19:13.760]  going to contest.
[19:13.760 --> 19:18.440]  Trump is going to come out to be smart and say, no, I've clearly won, because 97 percent
[19:18.440 --> 19:19.440]  has been counted.
[19:19.440 --> 19:23.880]  The courts have ruled these other ballots are illegal, and at that point, it's going
[19:23.880 --> 19:30.880]  to come to a stalemate until the Supreme Court rules against it, probably.
[19:30.880 --> 19:39.520]  But every day the Dems have to stir up trouble and to foment unrest after November 3 is going
[19:39.520 --> 19:45.840]  to be a day of extreme peril for this country.
[19:45.840 --> 19:50.840]  But yes, the numbers are coming out that mail-in balloting will not prevent a Trump presidency.
[19:50.840 --> 19:53.120]  We'll be covering some of that coming up.
[19:53.120 --> 19:56.960]  What the early voting numbers tell us is that the majority is Republican.
[19:56.960 --> 19:59.600]  It's a landslide, and those numbers are confirmed.
[19:59.600 --> 20:04.160]  Historic, 31 percent of black voters intend to cast their vote for President Trump in
[20:04.160 --> 20:05.440]  the latest poll.
[20:05.440 --> 20:08.240]  Other polls show as high as 40 percent.
[20:08.240 --> 20:15.240]  Meanwhile, Texas voter for Audar Harris County launches 24-hour voting as FBI investigates,
[20:15.240 --> 20:24.080]  picks up the Biden campaign official, took him into custody, reportedly Dallas Jones.
[20:24.080 --> 20:28.360]  That is all coming up.
[20:28.360 --> 20:32.760]  But let me hit really the big news here, and I'm going to come back and expand on what
[20:32.760 --> 20:36.800]  I see unfolding.
[20:36.800 --> 20:47.120]  The globalist CHICOM networks are controlled by multinational corporations, major banking
[20:47.120 --> 20:52.680]  and industrial and military institutions at the end of World War II began to put Mao
[20:52.680 --> 20:58.840]  Sik-Tung into power, there was a civil war inside the U.S. military between the Army
[20:58.840 --> 21:07.040]  and the newly created CIA, and that's where the real hatred of the Army and the CIA started.
[21:07.040 --> 21:09.360]  It's well documented.
[21:09.360 --> 21:15.160]  And so the Army that's had its corruption problems, but at least as loyal as the country,
[21:15.160 --> 21:24.120]  the U.S. is its milk cow, as its creature, I'm not going to say it's perfect, but its
[21:24.120 --> 21:30.440]  history is very belligerent, the outside groups want to come in and take it over.
[21:30.440 --> 21:35.760]  And in China, that's why it's called the John Burt's Society.
[21:35.760 --> 21:41.120]  He was an Army officer, but he and others got captured and tortured to death by CIA forces
[21:41.120 --> 21:50.240]  working with Mao Sik-Tung against Shen Kai-shek, and so by 49, the big globalist British intel
[21:50.240 --> 21:53.680]  Rockefeller crime sin to get Mao Sik-Tung into power.
[21:53.680 --> 21:58.120]  It took Mao a good 20 years to get control of the nation, and at that point, the Rockefellers
[21:58.120 --> 22:04.120]  came in with the industry, with the factories, with tens of billions of dollars of U.S. taxpayer
[22:04.120 --> 22:08.560]  money and built up communist red China to what it is today.
[22:08.560 --> 22:09.560]  That's all part of mainline history.
[22:09.560 --> 22:13.120]  That's not even hidden.
[22:13.120 --> 22:18.560]  And so U.S. Congress would pay to ship millions of rifles to Shen Kai-shek in the south of
[22:18.560 --> 22:19.560]  China.
[22:19.560 --> 22:26.000]  They would show up without firing pins, and that was the CIA.
[22:26.000 --> 22:28.680]  It doesn't mean everybody that was ever in the CIA is bad themselves.
[22:28.680 --> 22:35.840]  It means the CIA set up in 1947 of the National Security Act was a globalist coup at the top,
[22:35.840 --> 22:40.680]  and so it's been working its national interest forever to build up a world government.
[22:40.680 --> 22:43.400]  And so that's why I go back to history, because those that don't know history are doomed to
[22:43.400 --> 22:45.040]  repeat it.
[22:45.040 --> 22:51.200]  When I say communist China, I don't mean the hardworking, amazing, smart, industrious,
[22:51.200 --> 22:52.440]  incredible people of China.
[22:52.440 --> 22:59.720]  I mean, they're good folks, as Joe Biden says, but he says the communist party are good folks.
[22:59.720 --> 23:06.240]  They're horrible monsters put in power to suppress and control and enslave, then, the
[23:06.240 --> 23:15.160]  700 million Chinese people, now 1.45 billion, 1 billion, 450 million people, and that's
[23:15.160 --> 23:17.000]  what they've been doing.
[23:17.000 --> 23:21.960]  And so I can announce to you on October 29, 2020, that Trump's going to win it on landslide,
[23:21.960 --> 23:24.680]  but you've got to get everybody you know to vote, because they're going to try to block
[23:24.680 --> 23:26.360]  that landslide with fraud.
[23:26.360 --> 23:32.320]  But America has woken up, the world has woken up, the, quote, minorities have woken up to
[23:32.320 --> 23:38.400]  the fact that Democrats think they own them, and this is a huge sea change and a turning
[23:38.400 --> 23:46.680]  of the tide, a turning of the worm with four days, 12 hours, 34 minutes, 18 seconds left.
[23:46.680 --> 23:53.680]  And my intel is that, here's the big announcement, communist Chinese forces that are a sock puppet
[23:53.680 --> 23:54.680]  of the globalist.
[23:54.680 --> 23:58.200]  The globals look at their hands dirty, they put the money into China, and then China uses
[23:58.200 --> 24:02.480]  its operatives and its payoffs in Hollywood and the media and the US debt and all of it
[24:02.480 --> 24:04.520]  to control things.
[24:04.520 --> 24:07.280]  But the Chinese are basically giving up right now.
[24:07.280 --> 24:11.120]  The communist Chinese operatives have been ceasing a lot of their operations, they've
[24:11.120 --> 24:16.240]  been pulling their horns in, and they've not been making payments the last few weeks,
[24:16.240 --> 24:20.320]  as this Hunter Biden stuff comes out, to their high level operatives.
[24:20.320 --> 24:24.320]  That's why you see Dianne Feinstein, who's been a Chinese agent for 30 years, groveling
[24:24.320 --> 24:27.120]  to the Republican leader of the Senate.
[24:27.120 --> 24:31.560]  That's why you see more and more of them going, okay, we're not going to really push Biden
[24:31.560 --> 24:32.560]  stepping back.
[24:32.560 --> 24:36.760]  You've got the AOC's and the Ilhan Omar's, the America haters, they're too dumb to know
[24:36.760 --> 24:37.760]  what's going on.
[24:37.760 --> 24:41.320]  You've still got the Democrat base that hates America, trained to hate the country.
[24:41.320 --> 24:47.480]  But the leadership that was just bought off, and we're basically double agents, they are
[24:47.480 --> 24:53.920]  now capitulating, and there is a route taking place, and a full on collapse, and the command
[24:53.920 --> 24:58.280]  control operations of the CHICOM Globalist Takeover in America, because it's globalist
[24:58.280 --> 25:04.440]  forces using China as its catchpaw to take over the United States and Europe and other
[25:04.440 --> 25:05.440]  areas.
[25:05.440 --> 25:09.760]  And the Chinese influence is still incredible, the communist influence is still very dangerous,
[25:09.760 --> 25:12.480]  but its back is being broken.
[25:12.480 --> 25:19.760]  Right now the back is breaking today, and the gloves are off, and all the people that
[25:19.760 --> 25:27.560]  got their covers blown in the Office of Personnel Management Act are now having their vengeance,
[25:27.560 --> 25:33.040]  and they're just revenge for America against these globalists, and their networks are being
[25:33.040 --> 25:35.320]  destroyed right now.
[25:35.320 --> 25:39.200]  And I can tell you that some of the networks that were preparing with weapons, and were
[25:39.200 --> 25:43.920]  preparing to carry out terror attacks, there's networks I'm sure that I've been discovered,
[25:43.920 --> 25:47.160]  but a lot of networks have been discovered and have been dealt with.
[25:47.160 --> 25:50.400]  And that's what really scares the globalists, is that finally there's people under Trump's
[25:50.400 --> 25:52.720]  command that are not playing games.
[25:52.720 --> 25:58.200]  But I can tell you, they're not just killing jihadis or MS-13 and burying them in the desert.
[25:58.200 --> 26:02.720]  CHICOM operatives, as we speak, are disappearing.
[26:02.720 --> 26:06.880]  And I don't like that, but when you've got a foreign government attacking you and you're
[26:06.880 --> 26:11.160]  ganged up on, that's war, and then the rule of law goes out the window, because they're
[26:11.160 --> 26:13.800]  not citizens, and that's how this works.
[26:13.800 --> 26:18.000]  And so, I'm an expert on police states, I'm an expert on Posse Comintatas, I've interviewed
[26:18.000 --> 26:19.520]  all the experts, I've made films about it.
[26:19.520 --> 26:23.320]  I saw the Democrats wanting to take control of our government and our military and our
[26:23.320 --> 26:26.240]  police to use it against us, and I said, you will not do that.
[26:26.240 --> 26:29.240]  But now it's being used against them, which is still incredibly dangerous.
[26:29.240 --> 26:32.240]  But it's not as dangerous as letting the CHICOMs over to the country.
[26:32.240 --> 26:35.400]  So I can tell you, America, once again, is rising.
[26:35.400 --> 26:39.200]  The enemy is collapsing, they're panicking, they're scared, they don't know what to do.
[26:39.200 --> 26:42.360]  They've got tricks up their sleeves, though, we'll talk about those when we come back.
[26:42.360 --> 26:44.600]  We're not out of the woods yet, but we are really kicking ass.
[26:44.600 --> 26:47.080]  I want to salute you all for supporting this operation.
[26:47.080 --> 26:48.760]  You are the resistance.
[26:48.760 --> 26:54.280]  I once saw a bumper sticker that read, if you want your children to listen to you, whisper.
[26:54.280 --> 26:56.120]  And it's true.
[26:56.120 --> 27:00.640]  A lot of times, if somebody's shouting and yelling, even if what they're talking about
[27:00.640 --> 27:03.320]  is important, people tend to tune it out.
[27:03.320 --> 27:04.320]  You know why I know that?
[27:04.320 --> 27:09.880]  Because I'm Alex Jones, and I've been pretty obnoxious over the years because I'm worried
[27:09.880 --> 27:14.800]  about the New World Order, and I read about all their plans to lock down civilization,
[27:14.800 --> 27:18.320]  start the third world, and then enslave the first world.
[27:18.320 --> 27:23.320]  So I've been really, really loud and really, really aggressive, and we've had a big effect.
[27:23.320 --> 27:28.200]  But now it's time to think about every different angle and every different way we can get people
[27:28.200 --> 27:31.600]  to think for themselves before it's too late.
[27:31.600 --> 27:37.120]  The lockdown, the social distancing, the mask is meant to end human civilization.
[27:37.120 --> 27:41.160]  We are under a civilization collapse weapon.
[27:41.160 --> 27:42.880]  So this is live and death.
[27:42.880 --> 27:48.560]  Please share infowars.com and band on video and watch our live election coverage.
[27:48.560 --> 27:54.800]  Infowars has been reporting on the dark, unpleasant truths of big government corruption for over
[27:54.800 --> 27:55.800]  two decades.
[27:55.800 --> 28:03.680]  It is why they attack us, and it is why we are now the most banned broadcast in the world.
[28:03.680 --> 28:08.560]  The Hunter Biden hard drive scandal is merely the tip of the iceberg.
[28:08.560 --> 28:13.840]  Evil has infested governments everywhere, but the evil establishment is censoring content
[28:13.840 --> 28:16.480]  across all media platforms.
[28:16.480 --> 28:20.560]  They blocked you from sharing banned.video on social media.
[28:20.560 --> 28:28.080]  So go to electionnight.news and share it like your lives depended on it.
[28:28.080 --> 28:35.360]  Go to electionnight.news to find the truth about COVID, vaccines, Bill Gates, and Big
[28:35.360 --> 28:36.360]  Pharma.
[28:36.360 --> 28:43.760]  Go to electionnight.news to find all the information the crooked establishment is most afraid of.
[28:43.760 --> 28:48.880]  Go to electionnight.news and share now.
[28:48.880 --> 28:54.080]  Much of the time on big issues and societal developments, info wars is many, many years
[28:54.080 --> 29:00.080]  ahead, and almost all the time, we are tomorrow's news today, but there's a blind spot that
[29:00.080 --> 29:01.080]  info wars has.
[29:01.080 --> 29:03.760]  I've noticed that really informed people have this as well.
[29:03.760 --> 29:07.320]  I know a lot of you tuning in are some of the most formidable out there, so I want you
[29:07.320 --> 29:11.680]  to be retrospective and kind of examine yourself, because that's what I do every day.
[29:11.680 --> 29:17.680]  This Hunter Biden laptop is important, but the new audio confirmed to be him, where he
[29:17.680 --> 29:22.600]  admits he works under the Communist Chinese spy sheaf, he should be arrested right now.
[29:22.600 --> 29:29.560]  That is so huge, that is hiding in plain view, and it's getting almost no attention.
[29:29.560 --> 29:32.000]  We have to get that information out to everybody.
[29:32.000 --> 29:37.800]  It's all posted on infowars.com, so many other major patriotic sites, but we need to get
[29:37.800 --> 29:41.080]  it out to everybody and remember that we know all of this.
[29:41.080 --> 29:44.600]  We knew it a long time ago, so when it breaks now, we kind of go, okay, tell us that we
[29:44.600 --> 29:45.600]  didn't know.
[29:45.600 --> 29:51.480]  The point is now it's documented, now it's proven.
[29:51.480 --> 29:58.480]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[29:58.480 --> 30:16.760]  The historic moment we're living in is over the top, incredible.
[30:16.760 --> 30:22.240]  They say the whole lifetimes like the twinkling of an eye, out, out, brief candle, as Shakespeare
[30:22.240 --> 30:30.080]  said, but the next few days, the next few weeks are just a twinkle and a twinkle of
[30:30.080 --> 30:36.800]  an eye, and it's so huge and so amazing, and America is waking up, there's a global corporate
[30:36.800 --> 30:41.240]  government that's authoritarian and abusing us, and that it's using China and suppressing
[30:41.240 --> 30:46.000]  the Chinese people, and the Hong Kong people, the Taiwanese, and the Muslims, and the Christians,
[30:46.000 --> 30:50.800]  and the Buddhists, and humanity's really getting it, and even the big CEOs of the big tech
[30:50.800 --> 30:56.040]  companies themselves that are just front men are scared and are trying to figure out what
[30:56.040 --> 31:01.360]  they should do because they know they've been involved in espionage now, and they know that
[31:01.360 --> 31:04.640]  it's not going to be the way they thought it was.
[31:04.640 --> 31:08.320]  The New World Order will be defeated.
[31:08.320 --> 31:16.120]  The question is, will George Herbert Walker's Rockefeller New World Order kill billions
[31:16.120 --> 31:20.480]  of people in the process of trying to hang on by his fingernails?
[31:20.480 --> 31:25.280]  Because I've told the globalist, not as the spokesperson for the resistance, but just
[31:25.280 --> 31:30.880]  as somebody that can read the tea leaves as good as anybody, that the globalists could
[31:30.880 --> 31:37.040]  give up now and even keep a lot of their wealth and not be mischievous, and join team human,
[31:37.040 --> 31:42.480]  carbon, and they won't have to be destroyed.
[31:42.480 --> 31:45.560]  I have no desire to destroy these people.
[31:45.560 --> 31:49.640]  I do have a desire to get them off my back, and I will get them off my back, even if I
[31:49.640 --> 31:53.640]  die in the process.
[31:53.640 --> 31:55.220]  And they've figured that out now.
[31:55.220 --> 31:57.240]  They don't have the spirit.
[31:57.240 --> 32:00.120]  They don't have Abraham's blessing.
[32:00.120 --> 32:02.920]  They have Satan's blessing, and that's not a blessing.
[32:02.920 --> 32:03.920]  That's a curse.
[32:03.920 --> 32:09.720]  I'm not going to preach, let me get to the big news right now.
[32:09.720 --> 32:12.760]  Look at this stack of incredible news right here.
[32:12.760 --> 32:16.200]  I probably got 25 articles here.
[32:16.200 --> 32:18.200]  That's just dead reckoning that stack.
[32:18.200 --> 32:22.720]  It's going to be an overhead shot on this for TV viewers, because this is part of the
[32:22.720 --> 32:26.200]  sea change you're going to start seeing at every level, because the worm is turned, the
[32:26.200 --> 32:28.320]  tide is turning.
[32:28.320 --> 32:33.920]  Video, Twitter's Dorsey admits censorship mob rule is used on platform and congressional
[32:33.920 --> 32:38.560]  testimony yesterday, and says it's wrong.
[32:38.560 --> 32:40.960]  That's the worm turning.
[32:40.960 --> 32:44.560]  Howly, Senator, time for talk is past.
[32:44.560 --> 32:48.280]  It's time for Congress to take away Big Tech's special immunity.
[32:48.280 --> 32:53.320]  That brings us to this next article from infowars.com with the video and the audio.
[32:53.320 --> 32:58.840]  Joe Rogan debunks claims he spread anti-vascular conspiracy theories.
[32:58.840 --> 33:02.720]  He posted a video that I sent him yesterday, just one of many clips that we'll play in
[33:02.720 --> 33:03.720]  a moment.
[33:03.720 --> 33:10.440]  It's now got three plus million views, and just since last night on his Instagram, where
[33:10.440 --> 33:15.760]  Bill Gates is on CBS News saying 80% got sick that took one vaccine, and he goes on in the
[33:15.760 --> 33:22.120]  longer clip to say 100% got sick, and I'll show you that, but what are they going to
[33:22.120 --> 33:29.360]  do, because they had Bloomberg, they had Reuters, they had Forbes, they had the New York Times,
[33:29.360 --> 33:32.960]  they had Vanity Fair, they had the kitchen sink.
[33:32.960 --> 33:37.840]  I mean, so many, I can't even read them all, thousands is what comes up.
[33:37.840 --> 33:42.840]  You type in Joe Rogan, Alex Jones, Spotify, saying, Jones is insane.
[33:42.840 --> 33:46.520]  He claimed kids are getting polio from a polio vaccine with no proof.
[33:46.520 --> 33:51.360]  I showed AP article, oh, and the UN press really submitting it.
[33:51.360 --> 33:55.280]  Jones claims 80% got sick from vaccines, a total liar.
[33:55.280 --> 34:01.760]  Well, on that very show, we show the articles in the clips, so Joe's like, give me that
[34:01.760 --> 34:02.760]  clip.
[34:02.760 --> 34:03.760]  I said, here it is.
[34:03.760 --> 34:11.960]  He puts it out, and it'll have more viewers in 24 hours than the number one cable show
[34:11.960 --> 34:15.960]  Tucker Carlson does, and we're not in competition, it just shows how the truth is powerful.
[34:15.960 --> 34:20.240]  Of them saying, Bill Gates didn't say 80% got sick, even though the damn study shows
[34:20.240 --> 34:21.960]  it with his vaccine trial.
[34:21.960 --> 34:22.960]  And there it is admitted.
[34:22.960 --> 34:24.960]  They go, we got to de-platform Jones.
[34:24.960 --> 34:28.200]  He's telling outrageous lies when they know damn true.
[34:28.200 --> 34:29.200]  It's real.
[34:29.200 --> 34:30.200]  Incredible.
[34:30.200 --> 34:31.520]  Look at this.
[34:31.520 --> 34:37.760]  Joe Rogan debunks claims he spread anti-vaxxer conspiracy theories, and it goes on to say
[34:37.760 --> 34:41.360]  they call for de-platforming of Jones, and Jones should not have a voice, because he
[34:41.360 --> 34:45.400]  said 80% of participants had side effects.
[34:45.400 --> 34:48.800]  Let's go ahead and roll the clip they hope you don't see.
[34:48.800 --> 34:51.680]  DERNA vaccines sound concerning.
[34:51.680 --> 34:52.920]  We looked.
[34:52.920 --> 34:59.640]  After the second dose, at least 80% of participants experienced a systemic side effect, ranging
[34:59.640 --> 35:03.200]  from severe chills to fevers.
[35:03.200 --> 35:08.080]  So are these vaccines safe?
[35:08.080 --> 35:15.720]  Well the FDA not being pressured will look hard at that.
[35:15.720 --> 35:22.320]  The FDA is the gold standard of regulators, and their current guidance on this, if they
[35:22.320 --> 35:26.880]  stick with that, is very, very appropriate.
[35:26.880 --> 35:32.760]  And the side effects were not super severe.
[35:32.760 --> 35:37.720]  That is, it didn't cause permanent health problems for the same thing.
[35:37.720 --> 35:38.720]  Some folks just died.
[35:38.720 --> 35:41.600]  Moderna did have to go with a fairly high dose.
[35:41.600 --> 35:47.400]  So the other just died, but it's okay.
[35:47.400 --> 35:52.040]  To get the antibodies, here we clearly need a vaccine that works in the upper age range,
[35:52.040 --> 35:55.120]  because they're most at risk of that.
[35:55.120 --> 36:00.600]  And doing that so that you amp it up so it works in older people, and yet you don't have
[36:00.600 --> 36:01.600]  side effects.
[36:01.600 --> 36:13.080]  If we have one in 10,000 side effects, that's way more 700,000 people who will suffer from
[36:13.080 --> 36:14.080]  that.
[36:14.080 --> 36:21.320]  So really understanding the safety at gigantic scale across all age ranges, pregnant, male,
[36:21.320 --> 36:27.320]  female, undernourished, existing comorbidities, it's very, very hard.
[36:27.320 --> 36:33.840]  And that actual decision of, okay, let's go and give this vaccine to the entire world,
[36:33.840 --> 36:38.720]  governments will have to be involved, because there will be some risk and indemnification
[36:38.720 --> 36:43.200]  needed before that can be decided on.
[36:43.200 --> 36:50.040]  There will be some risk, there will be money needed, there will be liability protection.
[36:50.040 --> 36:53.920]  And I was just talking to Joe Rogan earlier, you go read the comments, the views even higher
[36:53.920 --> 36:57.560]  than that now, higher than 3 million plus.
[36:57.560 --> 37:01.800]  And every comment is, who is Bill Gates, why is he my doctor, and people are researching
[37:01.800 --> 37:05.960]  him now and finding out his depopulation statements, how he wants to depopulate people.
[37:05.960 --> 37:10.320]  It's like, well, you want to depopulate me, but now you control my health department,
[37:10.320 --> 37:11.840]  and you control the UN.
[37:11.840 --> 37:14.360]  I mean, this is so ridiculous.
[37:14.360 --> 37:19.160]  He's a crazy mad scientist in a lab coat with an injector.
[37:19.160 --> 37:20.160]  But look at these headlines.
[37:20.160 --> 37:24.560]  So, why do they want the Spotify interview banned, both number one on iTunes, number
[37:24.560 --> 37:29.800]  one on YouTube, number one all time of all categories on Spotify?
[37:29.800 --> 37:31.880]  Spotify.
[37:31.880 --> 37:36.360]  Number one thing ever is Alex Jones and Tim Dillon on Joe Rogan episode one, five, five,
[37:36.360 --> 37:38.960]  five, and that's in two days.
[37:38.960 --> 37:42.280]  Somebody pulled it internally, sabotaged, but it's been put back up.
[37:42.280 --> 37:45.480]  Still number one above Kanye West.
[37:45.480 --> 37:46.960]  Same thing on every other platform.
[37:46.960 --> 37:50.680]  That's why they're angry because truth is popular.
[37:50.680 --> 37:55.160]  That last part where they go, oh, Jones claimed in some trials, 100% got sick.
[37:55.160 --> 38:00.680]  This is out of the federal medical registry Atlanta business journal has it for the CDC's
[38:00.680 --> 38:01.680]  based.
[38:01.680 --> 38:04.480]  100% of Moderna vaccine participants suffered side effects.
[38:04.480 --> 38:07.880]  Just zoom in on that, please, for TV viewers.
[38:07.880 --> 38:10.480]  Okay, so that's what I'm covering.
[38:10.480 --> 38:12.680]  And what's crazy is this is all hidden in plain view.
[38:12.680 --> 38:13.680]  Here's Bloomberg.
[38:13.680 --> 38:14.680]  Spotify is on employees.
[38:14.680 --> 38:16.680]  Fred about Alex Jones appearing on Joe Rogan.
[38:16.680 --> 38:23.560]  And it says, I falsely claim with no evidence, 80% got sick in one test, 100% in another.
[38:23.560 --> 38:24.560]  Okay.
[38:24.560 --> 38:28.160]  Spotify reportedly won't take action after podcaster Joe Rogan interviewed by far right
[38:28.160 --> 38:30.560]  conspiracy theorist, Alex Jones.
[38:30.560 --> 38:31.800]  You talk about the fear.
[38:31.800 --> 38:36.160]  The spokesperson for YouTube came out last night and said, well, Jones is allowed because
[38:36.160 --> 38:39.360]  that's on YouTube too, Joe Rogan for now.
[38:39.360 --> 38:40.880]  Jones is allowed to be on an interview.
[38:40.880 --> 38:42.200]  We can't ban who people interview.
[38:42.200 --> 38:45.320]  We just ban Jones.
[38:45.320 --> 38:46.320]  See how that works?
[38:46.320 --> 38:48.680]  If you ban one person, then you got to ban everybody.
[38:48.680 --> 38:50.000]  And they're now, they're all mad about that.
[38:50.000 --> 38:51.640]  So my phone rang off the hook.
[38:51.640 --> 38:54.920]  All these other big talk show hosts that are on YouTube going, well, I didn't think I could
[38:54.920 --> 38:55.920]  have you on.
[38:55.920 --> 38:58.720]  Will you please come on?
[38:58.720 --> 39:00.040]  Think about that.
[39:00.040 --> 39:03.120]  They just heard there was censorship, so they didn't do it, even though that wasn't what
[39:03.120 --> 39:05.360]  was happening.
[39:05.360 --> 39:08.800]  That's enslavement.
[39:08.800 --> 39:12.720]  Joe Rogan finds a loophole and Spotify, Alex Jones ban a loophole.
[39:12.720 --> 39:14.320]  So they're like, oh, there's loopholes.
[39:14.320 --> 39:16.640]  We need to ban Jones and ban nationalists.
[39:16.640 --> 39:21.640]  We censor them all together as a cartel, then they go to Congress and say, none of that's
[39:21.640 --> 39:22.640]  going on.
[39:22.640 --> 39:29.040]  But now that that's not working, Jack Dorsey and Mark Zuckerberg say, oh, it's our employees
[39:29.040 --> 39:30.040]  doing it.
[39:30.040 --> 39:31.040]  It's mob rule.
[39:31.040 --> 39:35.600]  We've got that coming up and come back, but that just shows how they are in headlong flight
[39:35.600 --> 39:36.600]  right now.
[39:36.600 --> 39:37.600]  All right.
[39:37.600 --> 39:40.720]  We're going to come back, get into the election, get into the latest 100 Biden, get the number
[39:40.720 --> 39:41.720]  out.
[39:41.720 --> 39:42.720]  Take your calls.
[39:42.720 --> 39:43.720]  It's Ted Nugent and so much more.
[39:43.720 --> 39:44.720]  The country is happening.
[39:44.720 --> 39:47.720]  Praise God.
[39:47.720 --> 39:48.720]  Election 2020 is here.
[39:48.720 --> 39:54.840]  And whether Trump wins or loses, we have all won by exposing the common Chinese, by exposing
[39:54.840 --> 39:59.880]  the globalist, by exposing the pedophile rings, by exposing the fact this is really a fight
[39:59.880 --> 40:01.880]  between good versus evil.
[40:01.880 --> 40:05.960]  Now, I'm personally a Christian and I believe in God and I know God's real and I've experienced
[40:05.960 --> 40:06.960]  it in my life.
[40:06.960 --> 40:08.920]  Believe you don't believe in God.
[40:08.920 --> 40:11.360]  It's important to recognize that there is good in this world.
[40:11.360 --> 40:12.360]  There is evil.
[40:12.360 --> 40:16.680]  And there are people out there that want to do you harm because they enjoy doing that.
[40:16.680 --> 40:22.080]  And what I see happening across the spectrum of different political views is people finally
[40:22.080 --> 40:23.080]  get that.
[40:23.080 --> 40:26.680]  They finally understand that they're not being naive anymore.
[40:26.680 --> 40:32.480]  Don't ever project your decency and your goodness onto other people until they've proven what
[40:32.480 --> 40:35.800]  they stand for and who they are, or you're going to get hurt.
[40:35.800 --> 40:38.720]  But those of you out there that have done your own research and discovered who's good
[40:38.720 --> 40:43.000]  and who is faithful, will then come together with those organizations and support them
[40:43.000 --> 40:44.000]  like InfoWars.
[40:44.000 --> 40:48.240]  Because without your support, InfoWars would not exist.
[40:48.240 --> 40:51.080]  Something huge has happened in the last two weeks.
[40:51.080 --> 40:57.180]  Remember when Hunter Biden's laptop first broke and all of Big Tech in concert from
[40:57.180 --> 41:02.200]  Twitter to Facebook to YouTube, Google, all worked to block it?
[41:02.200 --> 41:06.560]  They didn't deny that it was real, they just wouldn't let anybody even talk about the
[41:06.560 --> 41:11.920]  story or link to major newspapers or even the House and Senate committees that were
[41:11.920 --> 41:12.920]  looking at it.
[41:12.920 --> 41:18.960]  Well, now fast forward as the fire hose information comes out and more tapes get released to them,
[41:18.960 --> 41:19.960]  more audio.
[41:19.960 --> 41:24.280]  With Hunter admitting he was a Communist Chinese agent, we're not trying to censor any more.
[41:24.280 --> 41:28.960]  Not because they're good people, but because this trizan effect boomeranged on their traitorous
[41:28.960 --> 41:32.360]  butts last time just a few weeks ago.
[41:32.360 --> 41:35.760]  And so now they know that trying to suppress it only makes it bigger, just like they've
[41:35.760 --> 41:38.480]  done with InfoWars in Bandai video.
[41:38.480 --> 41:39.480]  It's truly amazing.
[41:39.480 --> 41:43.600]  So keep telling the truth, the Lord works in mysterious ways, amazing things are happening
[41:43.600 --> 41:48.160]  and these Communist Chinese agents are going to pay.
[41:48.160 --> 41:53.280]  The miraculous properties of turmeric have been admired and even worshiped for thousands
[41:53.280 --> 41:55.080]  of years by ancient civilizations.
[41:55.080 --> 41:58.960]  But with modern science, we know why turmeric is so popular.
[41:58.960 --> 42:03.760]  It's antioxidant effect, it's anti-inflammatory effect.
[42:03.760 --> 42:05.960]  Everything it does is simply amazing.
[42:05.960 --> 42:09.520]  And most turmeric's out there are simply food products.
[42:09.520 --> 42:12.600]  They're 3 to 5% curcuminoid.
[42:12.600 --> 42:20.800]  But we have bodies ultimate turmeric formula with a 95% curcuminoid level and we have other
[42:20.800 --> 42:25.040]  organic products in there that accelerated and bring it into the cells of the body.
[42:25.040 --> 42:28.720]  It's been sold out for months, it's back in stock and despite that, bodies ultimate

[42:35.600 --> 42:37.920]  points at InfoWarsStore.com.
[42:37.920 --> 42:40.200]  It's bodies ultimate turmeric formula.

[42:45.720 --> 42:48.000]  and you can't lose, it funds the InfoWars.
[42:48.000 --> 42:54.720]  In January and February of the year 2020, the Communist super state China working through
[42:54.720 --> 43:00.800]  the United Nations told the world how we are now supposed to live our lives after COVID.
[43:00.800 --> 43:06.480]  Permanent social distancing, permanent mask, apps to track everywhere we go and what we
[43:06.480 --> 43:12.160]  do contact tracers coming to our doors with the police and dragging us away.
[43:12.160 --> 43:17.920]  This is the authoritarian medical tyranny takeover and it's never going to end until
[43:17.920 --> 43:20.520]  we start standing up and saying no.
[43:20.520 --> 43:26.160]  Lee Fauci and the WHO and the Communist Chinese are all over the news saying the lockdowns
[43:26.160 --> 43:28.280]  are permanent.
[43:28.280 --> 43:33.280]  Bill Gates said at least 10 years last week until restrictions are raised.
[43:33.280 --> 43:38.400]  By then we'll all be totally and completely trained to live under slavery and it will
[43:38.400 --> 43:39.440]  never end.
[43:39.440 --> 43:42.080]  This is the authoritarian takeover.
[43:42.080 --> 43:43.760]  Everyone must resist.
[43:43.760 --> 43:45.160]  Everyone must speak up.
[43:45.160 --> 43:50.920]  Everyone must say no now.
[43:50.920 --> 44:07.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[44:07.440 --> 44:08.440]  Welcome back.
[44:08.440 --> 44:09.440]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[44:09.440 --> 44:10.440]  I tend to open the phones up next hour.
[44:10.440 --> 44:15.120]  I'll give the number up before we end this hour so get ready to hear from you.
[44:15.120 --> 44:18.800]  But President Trump has been proven right again.
[44:18.800 --> 44:19.800]  Obviously he's the president.
[44:19.800 --> 44:20.800]  He isn't a liar.
[44:20.800 --> 44:21.800]  He gets a lot of key intel.
[44:21.800 --> 44:25.920]  That's why having a president actually working for you is a really powerful thing instead
[44:25.920 --> 44:29.880]  of working against you for the globalist and with the Chai comms and others.
[44:29.880 --> 44:34.120]  He was briefed immediately by Homeland Security that has the threat fusion centers and gets
[44:34.120 --> 44:41.720]  all the memos out of the police department that in Philly, Philadelphia, PA, the deputy
[44:41.720 --> 44:43.520]  police chief ordered a stand down.
[44:43.520 --> 44:48.440]  Well, you could see the cops in their riot gear having firebombs thrown at them and run
[44:48.440 --> 44:54.520]  over by cars running from thugs who didn't even outnumber them.
[44:54.520 --> 44:56.440]  Obviously the police were told to stand down.
[44:56.440 --> 45:00.880]  Even though they lowered standards for police and, you know, I'm sorry, nothing against
[45:00.880 --> 45:03.240]  women, but on average, you know, women can't fight as good as men.
[45:03.240 --> 45:06.760]  You had a bunch of women getting run over and killed.
[45:06.760 --> 45:09.440]  But we could tell that there was a stand down.
[45:09.440 --> 45:18.120]  Now, Fox 29 News has gotten the directive from the Philly police executive team and they've
[45:18.120 --> 45:24.400]  gotten the proof that the police commissioner, Melvin Singleton ordered a stand down.
[45:24.400 --> 45:30.720]  Now, you think the police wanted to run when one of their officers got run over and then
[45:30.720 --> 45:31.720]  a mob came after them?
[45:31.720 --> 45:38.600]  No, they were ordered to by Black Lives Matter deputy police chief, deputy commissioner.
[45:38.600 --> 45:39.600]  Really evil.
[45:39.600 --> 45:43.840]  But see, that's the cities are ordering that these are blue cities that want to be an example
[45:43.840 --> 45:47.960]  of lawlessness to collapse the whole country and Democrats control most cities.
[45:47.960 --> 45:49.960]  The UN has been part of this.
[45:49.960 --> 45:55.920]  Soros is funding getting district attorneys in and all of them in place.
[45:55.920 --> 45:59.200]  Hundreds and hundreds of sheriffs and district attorneys and county attorneys and more than
[45:59.200 --> 46:07.000]  20 state attorney generals have been fully financed by George Soros to do this now.
[46:07.000 --> 46:12.120]  And then you'll do anything for law and order, you'll capitulate to them.
[46:12.120 --> 46:15.120]  So here's President Trump talking about it yesterday in the media, a tactic, even though
[46:15.120 --> 46:18.160]  you could see it on tape, now confirmed with the police memo.
[46:18.160 --> 46:19.160]  Here it is.
[46:19.160 --> 46:25.160]  Can you comment on the latest police meeting in Philadelphia and the other state?
[46:25.160 --> 46:27.840]  It's a terrible thing.
[46:27.840 --> 46:34.200]  What I'm witnessing is terrible and frankly that the mayor or whoever it is that's allowing
[46:34.200 --> 46:42.200]  people to riot and loot and not stop them is also just a horrible thing.
[46:42.200 --> 46:43.800]  I saw the event.
[46:43.800 --> 46:44.800]  Everybody did.
[46:44.800 --> 46:45.800]  It was on television.
[46:45.800 --> 46:48.240]  It was a terrible event.
[46:48.240 --> 46:50.640]  I guess that's being looked at very strongly.
[46:50.640 --> 46:55.680]  We have federal, the federal government is looking at it also, but the rioting in Philadelphia,
[46:55.680 --> 46:56.680]  you have to stop it.
[46:56.680 --> 46:57.680]  They have to stop it.
[46:57.680 --> 47:03.320]  It's a local thing, as you know, we're not, we don't send unless we're asked.
[47:03.320 --> 47:06.200]  If they ask, if they ask for help, we'll be there very quickly.
[47:06.200 --> 47:07.200]  That's good.
[47:07.200 --> 47:08.200]  So you know this Trump is new.
[47:08.200 --> 47:09.200]  They obviously stood down.
[47:09.200 --> 47:13.080]  You can watch the video like anybody could, but now it's confirmed.
[47:13.080 --> 47:14.480]  They do it everywhere.
[47:14.480 --> 47:19.440]  Meanwhile, radical left preparing to overthrow election as Biden scandal escalates.
[47:19.440 --> 47:22.640]  We've got all the articles on infowars.com with the Democratic Party saying they're
[47:22.640 --> 47:27.680]  going to storm the White House if Trump doesn't concede in five days.
[47:27.680 --> 47:33.520]  Meanwhile, Vietnamese Baptist Church burned in Philadelphia during Black Lives Matter
[47:33.520 --> 47:34.520]  riots.
[47:34.520 --> 47:36.440]  We'll put that on screen for TV viewers.
[47:36.440 --> 47:37.440]  How nice.
[47:37.440 --> 47:41.760]  Van full of explosives discovered in Philly on third night of rioting.
[47:41.760 --> 47:46.200]  That full video is up on infowars.com if you want to see it.
[47:46.200 --> 47:51.520]  Meanwhile, New York Times reporter slams conservative media for seeking to draw attention to Philly
[47:51.520 --> 47:52.520]  riots.
[47:52.520 --> 47:53.520]  That's right.
[47:53.520 --> 47:54.520]  It's racist to show that.
[47:54.520 --> 48:00.240]  You got a black guy running around the knife trying to stab a black cop and two white cops.
[48:00.240 --> 48:03.880]  They shooting and then everybody riots and burns everything down and then it's white
[48:03.880 --> 48:04.880]  people's fault.
[48:04.880 --> 48:05.880]  Just absolutely.
[48:05.880 --> 48:10.240]  See, I don't want to feel good watching black folks act like this and go, oh, I'm superior.
[48:10.240 --> 48:13.080]  This is globalist brainwashing was real leadership of those communities.
[48:13.080 --> 48:14.080]  This wouldn't be happening.
[48:14.080 --> 48:19.200]  It's the mayor and the police chief and the Democrats and the media that push this behavior
[48:19.200 --> 48:23.680]  who they think black people are bad and they think they get black people to riot and do
[48:23.680 --> 48:25.160]  this to bring the country down.
[48:25.160 --> 48:28.280]  The truth is, that's why black folks in record numbers are voting for Trump because they
[48:28.280 --> 48:31.280]  see through this.
[48:31.280 --> 48:39.000]  They have found a bunch of young idiot thugs led by white anti-families and I'm not trying
[48:39.000 --> 48:40.000]  to blame white people.
[48:40.000 --> 48:41.400]  I'm saying what happens.
[48:41.400 --> 48:42.480]  We have the documents.
[48:42.480 --> 48:47.440]  This is led by Soros, damn it, to turn this country against each other.
[48:47.440 --> 48:48.440]  It's disgusting and it's sick.
[48:48.440 --> 48:53.120]  It's like a video I saw of a black guy looting and then another black guy steals his car
[48:53.120 --> 48:54.600]  so he calls the police.
[48:54.600 --> 48:57.960]  What do you think happens when rule of law collapses?
[48:57.960 --> 49:00.120]  Everything falls apart, dumbasses.
[49:00.120 --> 49:04.960]  You might get some stuff for free for a day, but then you don't have a job for a year.
[49:04.960 --> 49:10.520]  And sometimes the welfare stops showing up.
[49:10.520 --> 49:14.400]  The real enemies, the New York Times, oh, it's so bad they're drawing attention.
[49:14.400 --> 49:21.240]  Idaho left a shutter BSU campus, coffee shop owned by fiancee of paralyzed cop site, anti-cop
[49:21.240 --> 49:28.080]  sentiment when they found out that the coffee shop was owned partly by disabled cop.
[49:28.080 --> 49:29.080]  They shut it down.
[49:29.080 --> 49:30.720]  The university agrees.
[49:30.720 --> 49:31.720]  Cops are bad.
[49:31.720 --> 49:36.920]  You know, I got a guy that has security for me that was a SWAT team guy in California
[49:36.920 --> 49:39.560]  and then he does CrossFit training here in Austin.
[49:39.560 --> 49:42.920]  The head of CrossFit is a patriot, I'm told, but nationally, but locally they said, oh,
[49:42.920 --> 49:44.320]  you're a retired police officer.
[49:44.320 --> 49:47.320]  Get your stuff and get out of here.
[49:47.320 --> 49:48.760]  Talk about discrimination, folks.
[49:48.760 --> 49:53.880]  I had a major Texas bank that I've been with 20 years tell me a month ago, they said, we
[49:53.880 --> 49:54.880]  don't want to do business with you.
[49:54.880 --> 49:57.080]  We want you to get rid of your business account here.
[49:57.080 --> 50:02.920]  They said, by the way, your children have tutmo accounts here, that's college funds.
[50:02.920 --> 50:06.760]  We don't want anything to do with your family.
[50:06.760 --> 50:08.760]  Get your stuff and get out of here.
[50:08.760 --> 50:14.480]  And once they have a casual society, it's going to be for everybody, ladies and gentlemen.
[50:14.480 --> 50:18.280]  That's why conservatives and patriots and nationalists must look where we give our money,
[50:18.280 --> 50:23.240]  where we shop, where we stay, what we do, and only make sure it's patriots and Christians.
[50:23.240 --> 50:26.480]  You know, you can be a black Christian, you can be a white Christian, you can be whatever.
[50:26.480 --> 50:29.800]  You better respect Christianity at least, you better respect America.
[50:29.800 --> 50:33.080]  And so when the left says they don't want our business, good, hang a sign out front
[50:33.080 --> 50:37.640]  your business that you don't like America.
[50:37.640 --> 50:40.960]  Maybe it's a symbol you pissed on the flag or something so we could stay the hell away
[50:40.960 --> 50:41.960]  from you.
[50:41.960 --> 50:43.880]  Because we're the producers, you're not.
[50:43.880 --> 50:51.400]  When we're sick of your ass, France, three killed by attacker shouting Allah Akbar and
[50:51.400 --> 50:56.280]  suspected terrorist attack at Nice Church, where they already had the big truck of death
[50:56.280 --> 50:57.280]  attack.
[50:57.280 --> 51:02.800]  Form a Malaysian PM, Muslims have a right to be angry and kill millions of French people.
[51:02.800 --> 51:03.800]  Yes.
[51:03.800 --> 51:06.560]  Come get your welfare paid for and kill French people.
[51:06.560 --> 51:07.560]  Video.
[51:07.560 --> 51:12.040]  Belgian boy thrown downstairs during brutal beating by foreign suspect who we now learn
[51:12.040 --> 51:15.160]  is a Islamic, of course.
[51:15.160 --> 51:16.320]  It's just total war.
[51:16.320 --> 51:19.160]  I've got white people getting thrown in front of trains in New York.
[51:19.160 --> 51:21.120]  I've got white people getting shot and killed.
[51:21.120 --> 51:22.120]  It's all over the Internet.
[51:22.120 --> 51:23.800]  World star hip hop celebrates it.
[51:23.800 --> 51:28.160]  If the KKK out of sight celebrate and kill them black people, I'd call for people to
[51:28.160 --> 51:29.160]  be arrested.
[51:29.160 --> 51:30.160]  That's not free speech.
[51:30.160 --> 51:32.320]  That's that's that's called for crime.
[51:32.320 --> 51:35.080]  But oh, when the black people do it, it's cute and it's funny.
[51:35.080 --> 51:38.760]  It's sick and it's evil.
[51:38.760 --> 51:43.400]  Our story from news wars.com Iced force to release hundreds of criminally legals due
[51:43.400 --> 51:47.000]  to COVID people with sex crimes, raping children.
[51:47.000 --> 51:48.000]  You name it.
[51:48.000 --> 51:49.000]  All right.
[51:49.000 --> 51:51.200]  I'm going to give the number out.
[51:51.200 --> 51:52.200]  I want to take your calls.
[51:52.200 --> 51:55.360]  I want to get into the latest election news, latest under Biden news.
[51:55.360 --> 52:00.440]  I haven't even hit our top stories yet, plus I have a compilation of really evil stuff
[52:00.440 --> 52:06.440]  that our new Lord and master and King and doctor, our rapist, he wants to rape us with
[52:06.440 --> 52:07.440]  force inoculations.
[52:07.440 --> 52:11.120]  The rest of our mask, the rest of our lives, Bill Gates, that's coming up, but the toll
[52:11.120 --> 52:16.240]  free number to join us on air first time callers today, and putting those that we didn't get
[52:16.240 --> 52:18.200]  on air three or four callers were left on hold.

[52:31.760 --> 52:37.840]  On this subject, you can talk about something secondarily, but first, humor me.
[52:37.840 --> 52:39.400]  Listen to me carefully, please.
[52:39.400 --> 52:42.240]  How are the globalists going to strike back when they know they're losing and their Chai

[52:47.080 --> 52:49.160]  You've seen all the big arrests happen around the country.
[52:49.160 --> 52:53.600]  For every arrest you see, there's a lot more behind the scenes.
[52:53.600 --> 52:54.800]  How are they going to strike back?
[52:54.800 --> 52:55.800]  What's the race in the hole?
[52:55.800 --> 52:57.400]  We got to watch our six.
[52:57.400 --> 52:58.560]  What is our six?

[55:05.040 --> 55:15.040]  The great awakening is here, go to banned.video, download the videos and share.
[55:15.040 --> 55:33.640]  Support the information war at infowarstore.com and never give up the fight.
[55:33.640 --> 55:43.280]  I want us to sink in, I want us to sink in real good and to everybody listening including
[55:43.280 --> 55:44.780]  my own brain.
[55:44.780 --> 55:49.720]  This lockdown is incredibly sinister and has already started on 2 million people to death.
[55:49.720 --> 55:54.080]  It is designed to incrementally be slowly tightened down around our necks.
[55:54.080 --> 55:57.720]  They are never going to release it.
[55:57.720 --> 56:01.920]  That's why Trump coming out and saying we cannot quote beat the virus by staying locked
[56:01.920 --> 56:02.920]  up.
[56:02.920 --> 56:08.920]  It's not as deadly as they said it's so important because this is a UN bill gates globalist
[56:08.920 --> 56:15.640]  deployed corporate takeover where their businesses are all essential but our businesses aren't.
[56:15.640 --> 56:18.880]  This is destroying the world economy by design.
[56:18.880 --> 56:23.760]  This is economic warfare, this is war crime and now they are coming with the attempted
[56:23.760 --> 56:24.760]  force of noctuation.
[56:24.760 --> 56:29.840]  The gates pushing, you know what that is, that violates the Geneva Convention, the Nuremberg
[56:29.840 --> 56:32.600]  Code and so much more.
[56:32.600 --> 56:33.600]  Please spread the words.
[56:33.600 --> 56:42.000]  Please tell folks about Band-Aught Video and the facts that are posted there.
[56:42.000 --> 56:52.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[56:52.000 --> 56:55.120]  Alright your calls are coming up.
[56:55.120 --> 57:02.880]  Let's start with the next segment, 877-789-2539, so much to break down, so much to cover.
[57:02.880 --> 57:08.840]  Wow, our intel, if you can see it happening, Chinese agents getting arrested all over
[57:08.840 --> 57:15.240]  the US, globalist agents in deep trouble, truly an amazing time to be alive, giant new
[57:15.240 --> 57:19.800]  news dropping on the Hunter Biden scandal and the Joe Biden situation.
[57:19.800 --> 57:26.360]  I wanted to air this special report about the more aggressive COVID approach, the lockdown
[57:26.360 --> 57:30.800]  being expanded worldwide, he's only going to get more intense until we say no.
[57:30.800 --> 57:34.280]  It's never going to be released, the masks never go away, the force of inculations are
[57:34.280 --> 57:39.440]  coming, the lockdown of society, the corporate takeover is here until we start saying no,
[57:39.440 --> 57:41.720]  this is the new revolution here it is.
[57:41.720 --> 57:48.920]  The last 30 years told us they would use the fear of a deadly virus to take control and
[57:48.920 --> 57:53.520]  basically bring in permanent martial law, and now they have the big tech in place, now
[57:53.520 --> 57:57.600]  they have the contact tracing in place, now they have the excuse to make you all get used
[57:57.600 --> 58:01.440]  to getting permission to leave your house, it's happening.
[58:01.440 --> 58:04.760]  Every day, your COVID-19 test result was positive.
[58:04.760 --> 58:10.280]  People like Melissa Thomas are chasing some of America's newest cases of the coronavirus.
[58:10.280 --> 58:15.880]  They hang up on us, they challenge our authority, in many cases they tell us that they know
[58:15.880 --> 58:18.280]  better how to take care of their families.
[58:18.280 --> 58:25.160]  We are immediately with Dr. Ocaranza's assistance, we are issuing health orders that are delivered
[58:25.160 --> 58:30.480]  by a police officer and a public health official to their domicile.
[58:30.480 --> 58:34.560]  We spoke to residents who are frustrated that the situation has not improved in the more
[58:34.560 --> 58:36.960]  than 200 days we've been on this pandemic.
[58:36.960 --> 58:41.280]  It's really frustrating when someone who's been locked down themselves of their own
[58:41.280 --> 58:47.640]  volition, then somehow they get COVID and it's because out in the world, not everyone
[58:47.640 --> 58:52.400]  is acting that way, and so, yeah, it is really frustrating.
[58:52.400 --> 59:19.000]  Totally states.
[59:19.000 --> 59:33.000]  It's how the government are going to enforce the rules if people don't obey them.
[59:33.000 --> 59:41.000]  Well, there have been sanctions, arrests, stopping of people doing...
[59:41.000 --> 59:44.000]  Give me an example of what you might be arrested for.
[59:44.000 --> 59:54.000]  Well, we have seen people arrested for meeting up, two friends meeting up in Sicily from Rome and Milan.
[59:54.000 --> 1:00:04.000]  This is the video that raised questions about how New York City is enforcing social distancing.
[1:00:04.000 --> 1:00:17.000]  Look, look, look. He ain't even doing that. He's violent. He ain't even doing that.
[1:00:17.000 --> 1:00:19.000]  That's a powerful fire.
[1:00:19.000 --> 1:00:27.000]  This live stream video of the Tampa, Florida church service has ignited outrage, showing a crowd in sanctuary.
[1:00:27.000 --> 1:00:30.000]  The church, saying they should be considered an essential service.
[1:00:30.000 --> 1:00:38.000]  People are going totally crazy. As the president said, he wants to get everybody body back worshiping God come Easter Sunday. That needs to happen.
[1:00:38.000 --> 1:00:46.000]  President Trump has now changed that timeline and that pastor now arrested for failing to follow the stay-at-home order in his county.
[1:00:46.000 --> 1:00:50.000]  I'm not against the police. I'm against them being given an unconstitutional order.
[1:00:50.000 --> 1:00:58.000]  And then again, depending on the test, 90% of the positives, it turns out, with a quick reaction 15-minute test are false positives.
[1:00:58.000 --> 1:01:06.000]  Did you hear that? I'm going to show you the headlines. 90% in a study done in New York of positives were false.
[1:01:06.000 --> 1:01:10.000]  Didn't mean 90% of the tests were positive was less than 10%.
[1:01:10.000 --> 1:01:15.000]  But remember the meat packing plants were 3,000 people and 2,000 people that was in the Associated Press as well.
[1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:21.000]  Look it up. Thousands would be tested. None of them were sick and they'd find half of them.
[1:01:21.000 --> 1:01:26.000]  Or a third of, depending on the plant had COVID-19 because they didn't.
[1:01:26.000 --> 1:01:30.000]  This is the perfect thing. Testing goes up. Numbers of COVID go up.
[1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:36.000]  They go, oh, we've got to shut down. COVID numbers are up. But morbidity goes down and down and down.
[1:01:36.000 --> 1:01:42.000]  We were told it was going to be 5% and 4% and 3% of the public was going to die.
[1:01:46.000 --> 1:01:52.000]  There are many references in the Holy Bible to the mustard seed. And why is that?
[1:01:52.000 --> 1:01:59.000]  It's one of the tiniest seeds out there, but a giant tree like bush grows from it that produces more mustard seeds.
[1:01:59.000 --> 1:02:04.000]  Mustard was known by the ancients around the world to have amazing health effects.
[1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:12.000]  They didn't know why. Well, with modern science, we know it's one of the purest, cleanest, organic forms of selenium.
[1:02:12.000 --> 1:02:23.000]  We have bio-true selenium sold out for months back in stock at InfoWarsStore.com at 50% off, store-wide free shipping, and triple-patriot points.
[1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:33.000]  Bio-true selenium at InfoWarsStore.com is an amazing product and it's even more amazing in that it funds our operation.
[1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:39.000]  But if you don't know about selenium, research it. It is an essential nutrient in the body that you actually have to have.
[1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:45.000]  It's back in stock 50% off, triple-patriot points at InfoWarsStore.com and with free shipping.
[1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:18.000]  I'm going to lay out why the UN, why Gates launched the COVID hysteria and how it's about corporate governance and the perfect plan.
[1:03:18.000 --> 1:03:24.000]  I'm going to stand up and walk around and lay out some maps of the world to discuss it and talk about it.
[1:03:24.000 --> 1:03:28.000]  But I'm going to your phone calls for the rest of the hour as well. I'm going to them right now.
[1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:42.000]  I am and Matt are up first and then Robert and Peter and Lydia, Jim and many, many others, 877-789-2539 on this live Thursday, October 29 transmission.
[1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:49.000]  Now, if you just joined us, I'll get to all the newest breaking news at the bottom of the hour, as I said, but I want to get to your calls right now.
[1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:59.000]  I ask callers, if the deep states in trouble, if they're getting rolled up, if Chinese Communist agents, the Democratic Party are getting arrested in big raids every day, but it's not getting a lot of news coverage.
[1:03:59.000 --> 1:04:07.000]  If the pedophile rings are getting busted and the nexium cult and Gisling Maxwell and all these folks are getting arrested and convicted.
[1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:14.000]  How are they going to strike back? I can tell you, I've had, I don't tell you this to brag.
[1:04:14.000 --> 1:04:22.000]  I have high level people calling telling me that the worms turned, that the enemy's collapsing, that they're fleeing, and I've seen the evidence myself.
[1:04:22.000 --> 1:04:31.000]  Doesn't mean we're out of the woods, but because, you know, you can be in an ancient battle 3000, 2000 years ago, 500 years ago, and you don't have radar.
[1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:38.000]  You don't have satellites. You don't have drones. You don't have aircraft. You don't have people with binoculars on top hills with radio telling you what's going on.
[1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:48.000]  You think you've routed an enemy of 5000 troops. You've got 10,000 troops, but all of a sudden you find out they were an expeditionary force and around the hill comes 20,000.
[1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:56.000]  I mean, the enemy's got some aces up their sleeves. You can bet that, but they're acting like they're in full on total panic.
[1:04:56.000 --> 1:05:02.000]  Silicon Valley says censorship wrong, instead of denying it, they say that it's their employees doing it and mobs.
[1:05:02.000 --> 1:05:06.000]  I mean, they're really passing the buck. Now you're seeing lots of signs of this.
[1:05:06.000 --> 1:05:11.000]  So let's go to I am in Florida. I am welcome.
[1:05:11.000 --> 1:05:13.000]  Hey, Alex.
[1:05:13.000 --> 1:05:15.000]  Welcome.
[1:05:15.000 --> 1:05:19.000]  Well, hey, perfect segue. And God bless you. We all wish you well.
[1:05:19.000 --> 1:05:20.000]  Thank you.
[1:05:20.000 --> 1:05:27.000]  And, you know, being on the defensive seat, being put in a posture of having to explain yourself is obvious.
[1:05:27.000 --> 1:05:36.000]  And just to segue to Joe Rogan and the Rockefeller report, the annual report from 2010 that you guys were spending some time on.
[1:05:36.000 --> 1:05:43.000]  That report itself does exist, but only at this point in a archive document.
[1:05:43.000 --> 1:05:48.000]  They went and pulled it on their official website about three to four months ago.
[1:05:48.000 --> 1:05:58.000]  And I documented that. And if you go there live now, it's completely doctored. The operation lockstep chapter is not even there, Alex.
[1:05:58.000 --> 1:06:04.000]  You know, I noticed that Google is a worthless search engine. Now you've got to use duck duck go give actually have it right here.
[1:06:04.000 --> 1:06:12.000]  Give people an example of where they actually find the real one where it talks about the global police state shut down a society, but they even brag over shutting down society.
[1:06:12.000 --> 1:06:16.000]  It's good for the earth. We're vertically integrating. I mean, this is martial law.
[1:06:16.000 --> 1:06:30.000]  It's two succinctly different documents. They went in there and it's just an obvious kind of cover up and, you know, plausible deniability because they are the original launchers of these types of, you know, the scenarios that go live.
[1:06:30.000 --> 1:06:33.000]  I mean, the Rockefellers put Hitler in power and bragged about it.
[1:06:33.000 --> 1:06:40.000]  And they funded the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for those that don't know. So I don't have it in front of me, but I believe you. Where do people find the real document?
[1:06:40.000 --> 1:06:47.000]  Well, they're both archived on the Internet. I'm not going to give a source necessarily because I don't want to be wrong here on live live radio.
[1:06:47.000 --> 1:06:56.000]  But I know everybody in our camp, you know, from the many years of research, even all the people doing heavy Q research, they're going to be able to easily.
[1:06:56.000 --> 1:07:02.000]  I'm sure they all have screenshots. I mean, I have the original one right here for TV viewers. Go ahead and overshot this place.
[1:07:02.000 --> 1:07:13.000]  But if you go to Rockefeller's website now and you pull up the 2010 annual report, they have added a brand new one that they wrote this year, guaranteed.
[1:07:13.000 --> 1:07:19.000]  I hear you, brother, a world of tighter top down government control and more authoritarian.
[1:07:19.000 --> 1:07:28.000]  There it is. That's the one. That's the real leadership with limited innovations and growing citizen pushback. That's where we are.
[1:07:28.000 --> 1:07:33.000]  Yes, sir. That's exactly the topic you're asking people to talk about right now.
[1:07:33.000 --> 1:07:38.000]  No, I noticed it wasn't Jamie's fault. Jamie uses Google. He should use Duck Duck Go. It's a lot better.
[1:07:38.000 --> 1:07:44.000]  Yeah. And, you know, he had you in the hot seat being a fact checker and not so much a friend and just look at you.
[1:07:44.000 --> 1:07:49.000]  We're all we're we're we are all right now in a lot of ways more so than ever.
[1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:59.000]  That should have been a more of a given and he seems so resistant still and very much trying to appeal to the mainstream.
[1:07:59.000 --> 1:08:05.000]  No, Joe, I can tell you Joe did that all on purpose. Didn't tell me he was going to do it. So it would be real.
[1:08:05.000 --> 1:08:08.000]  And he figured that everything I was saying would be true and he did it on purpose.
[1:08:08.000 --> 1:08:11.000]  And he did great. He did great. It really did.
[1:08:11.000 --> 1:08:16.000]  You know, I'll tell you this, I'm not complaining, but I had a wisdom tooth cracked right down the middle that abscess.
[1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:21.000]  You know, that and it was it had broken the day before it was hurting like hell during the interviews.
[1:08:21.000 --> 1:08:24.000]  And then I started, you know, he had a bottle of whiskey there and I started drinking it.
[1:08:24.000 --> 1:08:29.000]  He was he was sober October. And so, you know, he was kind of grumpy Joe.
[1:08:29.000 --> 1:08:32.000]  But I mean, I mean, Joe did a great job. I think he would have me on.
[1:08:32.000 --> 1:08:35.000]  Look at how they're calling for him to be the platform as he had me on.
[1:08:35.000 --> 1:08:37.000]  I mean, these other outlets won't even do it.
[1:08:37.000 --> 1:08:42.000]  The timing is beautiful. It's great. We wish you well Alex and continue.
[1:08:42.000 --> 1:08:44.000]  I am. We love you. Thanks for the call.
[1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:47.000]  Nick and Connecticut. Thanks for holding your own here. Go ahead, Nick.
[1:08:47.000 --> 1:08:49.000]  Hey, Alex, do you hear me good?
[1:08:49.000 --> 1:08:50.000]  Yes, sir.
[1:08:50.000 --> 1:08:52.000]  All right. Thanks for taking my call out.
[1:08:52.000 --> 1:09:01.000]  I'm all I'm calling today because I'm a night crew stock worker for a grocery store and I got suspended for not wearing a mask.
[1:09:01.000 --> 1:09:04.000]  And I was just wondering what do you think I should do about it?
[1:09:04.000 --> 1:09:05.000]  Do you think I should bow down?
[1:09:05.000 --> 1:09:09.000]  We have guests on that again, you're doing heavy labor. You're there.
[1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:13.000]  Nobody's there. They make you wear the mask. It's a sign of occult control.
[1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:17.000]  Federal and state law says if you have asthma or anxiety, they can't make you wear it.
[1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:20.000]  I don't know what to say about it, brother, but it's just wrong.
[1:09:20.000 --> 1:09:22.000]  And that's what I'm going to cover at the bottom of the hour.
[1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:24.000]  This is corporate governance.
[1:09:24.000 --> 1:09:26.000]  So it doesn't matter what the federal or state government does.
[1:09:26.000 --> 1:09:29.000]  The bureaucracy is doing it. The corporations are.
[1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:37.000]  And that's where we need government and citizens to come in and make them know we're aware and stop the corporate executives that just call a lawyer.
[1:09:37.000 --> 1:09:40.000]  And the lawyer tells them, do whatever the UN says and you'll be safe.
[1:09:40.000 --> 1:09:43.000]  Well, no, then the lockdown never ends and your company goes bankrupt.
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:46.000]  So these businesses aren't thinking three dimensionally.
[1:09:46.000 --> 1:09:48.000]  They're acting like little lemmings and they're idiots.
[1:09:48.000 --> 1:09:51.000]  So we've got to educate them.
[1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:54.000]  I totally agree, Alex. You know, I mean, everyone has a mask on the door.
[1:09:54.000 --> 1:09:58.000]  I mean, it's just, it's so sickening that I'm the only one that refused to put it on.
[1:09:58.000 --> 1:10:01.000]  I mean, everyone's got the little diapers on and everything, you know what I mean?
[1:10:01.000 --> 1:10:06.000]  I've got other videos, seven mothers forcibly removed from school board meeting for refusing to wear a mask.
[1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:12.000]  Now Democrats say, wear them in your homes. In England, they say in signs, look away from someone.
[1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:15.000]  Don't look people on the eyes. It's all cult programming.
[1:10:15.000 --> 1:10:18.000]  It's all cult brainwashing, Alex. I totally agree.
[1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:19.000]  I totally agree.
[1:10:19.000 --> 1:10:23.000]  And notice the left wants to fire all the cops. They want the cops to enforce this.
[1:10:23.000 --> 1:10:25.000]  The cops are enforcing this are the problem.
[1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:27.000]  God bless you. Thank you, Nick.
[1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:30.000]  All right, let's go and take another call. Let's talk to Matt in California.
[1:10:30.000 --> 1:10:32.000]  Matt, thanks for holding. Go ahead.
[1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:33.000]  Hey, Alex, you hear me okay?
[1:10:33.000 --> 1:10:34.000]  Yes, sir.
[1:10:34.000 --> 1:10:37.000]  It is a pleasure to talk to you, sir. Thank you so much.
[1:10:37.000 --> 1:10:38.000]  I know you.
[1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:40.000]  I love you too.
[1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:41.000]  Go ahead.
[1:10:41.000 --> 1:10:43.000]  Anyway, I know. Yeah, we're living on time anyway.
[1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:50.000]  I'm an airline pilot. I can't say who I fly for obviously, but you know, everybody I fly with all the other pilots.
[1:10:50.000 --> 1:10:52.000]  We are so sick of wearing the mask.
[1:10:52.000 --> 1:10:55.000]  You know, we have to wear it walking around the terminal just to put on the show.
[1:10:55.000 --> 1:11:00.000]  But as soon as that door closes, everybody, you know, we're all taking our mask off because it's absolutely ridiculous.
[1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:05.000]  I mean, I would love to be proud of the company I work for and if they were to come out and say, hey, you know what, wear a mask.
[1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:07.000]  It's optional. You got to walk through the terminal.
[1:11:07.000 --> 1:11:09.000]  We're in the mask because you're in that state, whatever.
[1:11:09.000 --> 1:11:14.000]  I mean, I think that's ridiculous too, obviously, but it's just, it's such a joke.
[1:11:14.000 --> 1:11:19.000]  What do you think of Bill Gates now saying 10 years before the mask comes off and others say forever?
[1:11:19.000 --> 1:11:21.000]  I mean, obviously it's a power grab.
[1:11:21.000 --> 1:11:25.000]  Obviously, yeah, obviously a power grab trying to scare everybody into it.
[1:11:25.000 --> 1:11:34.000]  And I really think another part of it too is this whole thing was basically, you know, COVID-19 released to freak everybody out,
[1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:37.000]  cause a mask hysteria like we've been talking about, like you've been talking about,
[1:11:37.000 --> 1:11:42.000]  to cause everybody on November 3rd to turn around and go, oh, how great is my life then, blah, blah, blah.
[1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:47.000]  And the media has tried to twist that to say, oh, this is all Trump's fault to cause them.
[1:11:47.000 --> 1:11:50.000]  Oh man, it's so clear. I'm going to hold you over because you've been holding since yesterday.
[1:11:50.000 --> 1:11:51.000]  We called you back.
[1:11:51.000 --> 1:11:59.000]  This is all run into your holes and then Bill Gates rolls out with his work from home software and chicken little and society's over.
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:01.000]  And the media is all it's Trump's fault.
[1:12:01.000 --> 1:12:05.000]  The country's in trouble because of COVID that people see through it.
[1:12:05.000 --> 1:12:14.000]  So it's going to backfire when I come back, man, I want to ask you where you think that's going next and how you think the establishment is going to strike back because America gets it.
[1:12:14.000 --> 1:12:15.000]  The world gets it.
[1:12:15.000 --> 1:12:20.000]  People may be complying with the mask here and there, but now as they learn, it's forever.
[1:12:20.000 --> 1:12:25.000]  Now as they learn it's a permanent shutdown for their small businesses, people are saying no.
[1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:31.000]  And so they've already had federal and state courts across the country say it's unconstitutional to make you wear a mask or do social distancing.
[1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:39.000]  So be like the church's businesses, put up a sign saying we don't follow their rules and have people sign a form when they come in waving liability.
[1:12:39.000 --> 1:12:44.000]  That's what free associates is all about and get out of this leftist cult of fear run by lawyers.
[1:12:44.000 --> 1:12:50.000]  I get asked all the time by listeners and by the media, what am I most proud of when it comes to the show?
[1:12:50.000 --> 1:12:57.000]  And it's the fact that info war is more than 25 years ago doing basic research with what the club of Rome and the CFR and others were actually saying.
[1:12:57.000 --> 1:13:07.000]  Develop the hypothesis that the communist China had been set up to take our jobs and transfer them to China and then make us economically destitute and position us into debt.
[1:13:07.000 --> 1:13:12.000]  Well, now China owns the debt, now China owns Hollywood, all the one side of trading deals.
[1:13:12.000 --> 1:13:15.000]  It turns out our analysis was absolutely dead on.
[1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:22.000]  But again, it wasn't that hard. The CFR and others admitted what they were doing, but still others didn't want to focus on that issue.
[1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:27.000]  We did. And you focused on it by supporting us at info wars.
[1:13:27.000 --> 1:13:33.000]  So when you go to infowarstore.com and get all the great supplements, books, t-shirts, films, water filtration, air filtration, all of it,
[1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:38.000]  you're funding the organization that literally helped make up the world what's really happening.
[1:13:38.000 --> 1:13:43.000]  So that's a big accomplishment for all of you. I want to thank you for your support.
[1:14:09.000 --> 1:14:14.000]  It's a woman's design shirt. My wife really likes it. She sent me this gift. It's pretty cute. Here it is.
[1:14:14.000 --> 1:14:20.000]  And it's just, you know, it's a little historic thing. I think Trump's gonna win, but if Biden's able to steal it, we'll be probably shut down pretty quick.
[1:14:20.000 --> 1:14:28.000]  So it'll be historic thing to have. You'll only be able to fight them in the third dimension on the street with graffiti, with handbills you hand out and with noncompliance,
[1:14:28.000 --> 1:14:36.000]  not paying taxes and pulling your kids out of the schools and just making it a full time job to expose and fight and obstruct the criminal foreign takeover of America.
[1:14:36.000 --> 1:14:42.000]  We've gotten to that point. Biden's for nursing home. I hope to retire Biden. That'd be a collector's item. Get it while you still can.
[1:14:42.000 --> 1:14:44.000]  We're not ordering more. infowarstore.com
[1:14:44.000 --> 1:15:07.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:15:07.000 --> 1:15:17.000]  Cyrus Jones from 1810 to 1913. Made his great-grandchildren believe you could live to 103.
[1:15:17.000 --> 1:15:23.000]  103 is forever when you're just a little kid.
[1:15:23.000 --> 1:15:37.000]  So, so Cyrus Jones live forever.
[1:15:37.000 --> 1:15:44.000]  All right, finishing up again, your host Alex Jones here with Matt in California, an airline pilot talking about the mask, the BS.
[1:15:44.000 --> 1:15:47.000]  Remember, it was gonna be for a few months. Now it's forever.
[1:15:47.000 --> 1:15:56.000]  I would start that conversation up with people and just bring this up. I know it's killed air travel. I know they're putting people on these no fly lists that pull their mask down to eat.
[1:15:56.000 --> 1:16:08.000]  It's just, it's just absolutely disgusting. You know, how about folks when they get on the plane, the flight attendants and the captain and the copilot just decide to not go along with things.
[1:16:08.000 --> 1:16:15.000]  Americans used to be known for not following edicts. It's time to just stop complying.
[1:16:15.000 --> 1:16:23.000]  Have you seen the numbers Matt put out by the International Airline Association that you've got a one in 23,000 chance of getting covered on an airplane?
[1:16:23.000 --> 1:16:28.000]  It's so rare. And that's why I think, you know, we're talking about how the globalists come back to make things worse.
[1:16:28.000 --> 1:16:36.000]  And I think really it's going to, you know, all the things that we want as Americans to do again, to travel around our country and around the world freely, be able to go to a store, go to a restaurant.
[1:16:36.000 --> 1:16:40.000]  I mean, it's ridiculous here in California. I got to wear a mask to walk through a restaurant.
[1:16:40.000 --> 1:16:43.000]  Once I sit down, then I take the mask off and I'm sitting around all these other people.
[1:16:43.000 --> 1:16:46.000]  It's all just compliance training. It's all slave training.
[1:16:46.000 --> 1:16:55.000]  It absolutely is. You know, and actually this last weekend, I've been trying to call a week, but anyway, this last weekend was with one of the pro-Trump caravans in Seal Beach, California.
[1:16:55.000 --> 1:17:02.000]  And everybody there, all the Patriot Americans, all they all agree that the mask is completely BF. Nobody was even wearing a mask at that.
[1:17:02.000 --> 1:17:06.000]  We all felt safe and free. And it was interesting, just the observation real quick.
[1:17:06.000 --> 1:17:14.000]  You know, we got flipped off maybe by a half a dozen people. There was so much support for Trump in Seal Beach and Norsemore, California.
[1:17:14.000 --> 1:17:22.000]  But the only people that flipped us off were always these white liberals who had an infel who was living in his mom's basement that came out to call us racists.
[1:17:22.000 --> 1:17:32.000]  The car in front of me was full of, it was an Asian guy driving, African American on the right seat, and then Hispanic woman that was waving an American flag and he called them racists.
[1:17:32.000 --> 1:17:37.000]  I mean, it's just so clear, the brainwashing, and it's just so sad to watch too.
[1:17:37.000 --> 1:17:41.000]  What do they do when they lose in five days?
[1:17:41.000 --> 1:17:48.000]  I hit the panic button completely, and I really think, you know, coming full circle back around either something else is going to come out.
[1:17:48.000 --> 1:17:56.000]  That's going to be way worse because we never saw here in the U.S. people falling down, dying in the streets like we saw with the videos coming from China.
[1:17:56.000 --> 1:18:09.000]  I mean, I thought it was obviously all BS, but I really think something else is going to happen that either it could be way worse than COVID or some other kind of hysteria that's going to be even worse driving us to get back in our home.
[1:18:09.000 --> 1:18:12.000]  Matt, you just read my mind. Thanks for the call. That's what I was going to cover next.
[1:18:12.000 --> 1:18:20.000]  Economic collapse, financial manipulation, a new war. That's all in the cards. They're going to try a race riot. That's already going on, but here's what they're going to do.
[1:18:20.000 --> 1:18:21.000]  This is Fox News.
[1:18:21.000 --> 1:18:28.000]  Coronavirus mutations spreads across Europe report a new wave of lockdowns and businesses closings.
[1:18:28.000 --> 1:18:36.000]  I predicted eight months ago there'll always be new mutations, always a new reason to be locked down under the globalist system.
[1:18:36.000 --> 1:18:41.000]  This is it. It's martial law. It's what tyrants always crave. And yes, of course, now it's here.
[1:18:41.000 --> 1:18:46.000]  And if one person could die, we got a lockdown civilization and starved tens of millions.
[1:18:46.000 --> 1:18:50.000]  This is fundamentally a war on logic.
[1:18:50.000 --> 1:18:53.000]  All right, let's go to Jim in California than Lydia.
[1:18:53.000 --> 1:18:58.000]  Oh, no, Lydia in the UK first. Lydia in the UK. Thanks for holding. Go ahead.
[1:18:58.000 --> 1:19:01.000]  Hello, Alex. Can you hear me?
[1:19:01.000 --> 1:19:03.000]  Yes, I can. Thanks for calling.
[1:19:03.000 --> 1:19:06.000]  It's a great honor to be on your show.
[1:19:06.000 --> 1:19:17.000]  I'm calling from the north of England, Yorkshire, to be exact. And lockdown is in tier two here.
[1:19:17.000 --> 1:19:25.000]  Basically, the radio stations are pumping out propaganda 24-7.
[1:19:25.000 --> 1:19:30.000]  Oh, I know they are. It's like, we need permanent lockdowns. Don't have sex without a mask.
[1:19:30.000 --> 1:19:35.000]  I've seen signs. Don't look at people in the eyes. I mean, it's crazy.
[1:19:35.000 --> 1:19:41.000]  Do you think that's crazy? There's literally signs saying how far two meters is.
[1:19:41.000 --> 1:19:47.000]  So it's like, oh, it's two lions or, oh, it's the size of an average rugby player.
[1:19:47.000 --> 1:19:49.000]  It's like, do they think we're stupid? You know?
[1:19:49.000 --> 1:19:53.000]  Well, what it is, this is a societal power grab all over the US.
[1:19:53.000 --> 1:19:57.000]  Mayor Lightfoot and others dress up as superheroes and talk about COVID.
[1:19:57.000 --> 1:20:02.000]  I mean, these are people that want to run our lives who found a way to be in control and make us children.
[1:20:02.000 --> 1:20:05.000]  I mean, that's it. These are just raving criminals.
[1:20:05.000 --> 1:20:11.000]  Oh, you're absolutely correct. You've always spoke out for the truth and I have great respect for that.
[1:20:11.000 --> 1:20:18.000]  And unfortunately, any building you go now or any vehicle or any motor transport, you have to wear a mask.
[1:20:18.000 --> 1:20:23.000]  And next is going to be, you've got to have the inoculation and the certificate on your smartphone.
[1:20:23.000 --> 1:20:25.000]  And that's what they're setting up.
[1:20:25.000 --> 1:20:28.000]  Track and trace app. It's disgusting. And they've actually...
[1:20:28.000 --> 1:20:31.000]  That's right. They're already rolling that out there. And again, they're using businesses.
[1:20:31.000 --> 1:20:34.000]  It's not the government. The government just goes, oh, businesses need to do it.
[1:20:34.000 --> 1:20:39.000]  So when you go in a restaurant, they're demanding it. So you've got to have a phone to go to a restaurant and be tracked.
[1:20:39.000 --> 1:20:44.000]  Yeah. My recommendation for anyone with that, if you want to avoid getting the smartphone tag,
[1:20:44.000 --> 1:20:49.000]  what you do is you take a brick phone and say you do not have a cellular device.
[1:20:49.000 --> 1:20:52.000]  Or what you do is write a fake name and a fake number.
[1:20:52.000 --> 1:20:57.000]  No, I agree. But that's just the beta testing. They're coming in with a world ID on the phones.
[1:20:57.000 --> 1:20:59.000]  We must resist it now.
[1:20:59.000 --> 1:21:02.000]  Anything else, Lydia, from the UK?
[1:21:02.000 --> 1:21:07.000]  What else is happening in the UK?
[1:21:07.000 --> 1:21:14.000]  Well, at the moment, in the UK, we're seeing my boyfriend lives in a different county.
[1:21:14.000 --> 1:21:17.000]  And his place has been put down into tier three lockdown.
[1:21:17.000 --> 1:21:23.000]  So if I was to meet up with him, we'd be both charged 3,000 pounds sterling.
[1:21:23.000 --> 1:21:29.000]  That's the way to make the general public criminals but illegal aliens coming in over the channel in boats.
[1:21:29.000 --> 1:21:31.000]  Totally legal.
[1:21:31.000 --> 1:21:34.000]  They're being pumped in throughout the whole lockdown.
[1:21:34.000 --> 1:21:38.000]  Well, yeah, you're being invaded while you're locked down. That's how it works.
[1:21:38.000 --> 1:21:40.000]  Yeah, it's an EU invasion. It's a UN invasion.
[1:21:40.000 --> 1:21:44.000]  That's why Nigel Farage tries to go show it. They threaten to arrest him because the government is criminal.
[1:21:44.000 --> 1:21:47.000]  Boy, is it Boris Johnson a disappointment?
[1:21:47.000 --> 1:21:50.000]  Oh, it's such a disappointment. I am so disappointed in him.
[1:21:50.000 --> 1:21:55.000]  Like, the other day, he was questioned about feeding the public's children.
[1:21:55.000 --> 1:22:06.000]  Like, businesses are going down, people are closing down. He stumbled and did not know how to answer about the children of our working classes to be fed.
[1:22:06.000 --> 1:22:08.000]  It's disgusting.
[1:22:08.000 --> 1:22:11.000]  It's just like the many others.
[1:22:11.000 --> 1:22:14.000]  It's insane. Thank you so much, ma'am, for the call. We're going to come back.
[1:22:14.000 --> 1:22:20.000]  I'm going to hit some important intel on the coronavirus, on the fraud and where it's all going.
[1:22:20.000 --> 1:22:28.000]  And then I'll go back to your phone calls ahead of Ted Nugent joining us. We'll continue with Peter and New Hampshire and Jim and so many others.
[1:22:28.000 --> 1:22:31.000]  And what's coming up in just five days, they're going to contest the election.
[1:22:31.000 --> 1:22:37.000]  The question is, how long will they be able to get away with that? Well, we're going to find out separately.
[1:22:37.000 --> 1:22:48.000]  Now back in stock, bodies, ultimate turmeric formula, 95% of humanoid, all the things it does for your body, your immune system, your antioxidants, anti-inflammatory.
[1:22:48.000 --> 1:22:53.000]  It's the best turmeric. I think you're going to find out there. And it funds the InfoWare, so you can't lose.
[1:22:53.000 --> 1:22:55.000]  It's back in stock.
[1:22:55.000 --> 1:23:02.000]  InfoWareStore.com, InfoWareStore.com, or AAA-253-3139.
[1:23:02.000 --> 1:23:10.000]  Joint support, nobility support, flexibility support, inflammation support, turmeric root extract, 95% of humanoid,
[1:23:10.000 --> 1:23:19.000]  Oswalin, serratin extract, organic, spearmint, sage, lemon balm, and thyme leaves, and peppering from black pepper.
[1:23:19.000 --> 1:23:24.000]  It's an amazing product. And we have Biotrus selenium, 50% off free shipping.
[1:23:24.000 --> 1:23:28.000]  Purple Patriot points as well. Back in stock. That'll be our big sale next week, but it's already launched.
[1:23:28.000 --> 1:23:33.000]  But the Black Friday comes in October, and all the other items, big discounts, that ends in a few days.
[1:23:33.000 --> 1:23:37.000]  So take advantage of those now and get great t-shirts to spread the word. Thank you for being with us on air.
[1:23:37.000 --> 1:23:42.000]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[1:23:42.000 --> 1:23:47.000]  As I take this announcement, we were exactly 14 days out from the election.
[1:23:47.000 --> 1:23:52.000]  And the globalist-controlled Democrats know that America has woken up to them and turned against them.
[1:23:52.000 --> 1:23:55.000]  The whole planet is in a huge populace for alignment.
[1:23:55.000 --> 1:24:05.000]  And so they've openly said, we need to go to pure authoritarianism, not just censorship, but physically attacking and arresting anyone that doesn't submit to our agenda.
[1:24:05.000 --> 1:24:11.000]  And they're on record saying that once they remove Trump, they are going to persecute Trump's base,
[1:24:11.000 --> 1:24:14.000]  and going to try to prosecute us and put us all in prison.
[1:24:14.000 --> 1:24:19.000]  This is what all the old Clintonistas are saying. It's what the Obama bots are saying.
[1:24:19.000 --> 1:24:23.000]  It's what Keith Overman's saying. It's what Nancy Pelosi's saying.
[1:24:23.000 --> 1:24:27.000]  This is their stated criminal authoritarian intent.
[1:24:27.000 --> 1:24:31.000]  And they intend to keep the lockdowns going forever and forced inoculations.
[1:24:31.000 --> 1:24:36.000]  Trump is trying to end the lockdowns and is saying vaccines will be voluntary.
[1:24:36.000 --> 1:24:42.000]  Donald Trump or die. You've got to get Trump in. Everybody get out there and vote and tell your family to vote now.
[1:24:53.000 --> 1:24:57.000]  Now it's easier than ever to have Band.Video on your iPhone.
[1:24:57.000 --> 1:25:01.000]  Simply go to Band.Video with your Safari browser.
[1:25:01.000 --> 1:25:04.000]  Then you click the share button at the bottom of the screen.
[1:25:04.000 --> 1:25:07.000]  When the menu comes up, you simply click add to home screen.
[1:25:07.000 --> 1:25:12.000]  It will then ask you to name the app. I suggest Band.Video.
[1:25:12.000 --> 1:25:17.000]  You will now have Band.Video app on your home screen, despite the fact that Tim Cook tried to stop it.
[1:25:17.000 --> 1:25:26.000]  The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action, you can override them, have the app, and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[1:25:26.000 --> 1:25:30.000]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons below.
[1:25:30.000 --> 1:25:57.000]  On your email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube, however you want, be sure to share Band.Video.
[1:26:01.000 --> 1:26:12.000]  Don't just track your location, but your surfing history, where you go, who you talk to, your relationships, and they all share the data with each other of what you're doing on the apps as well.
[1:26:12.000 --> 1:26:24.000]  Including having apps turn on and listen to what you're saying, just like Siri or Alexa do, and then putting databases, transcripts of everything you say into those systems to be saved forever.
[1:26:24.000 --> 1:26:29.000]  Your phone is spying on you and companies are generating secret surveillance scores based on information.
[1:26:29.000 --> 1:26:32.000]  This is the Global Chinese Communist Social Credit Score.
[1:26:32.000 --> 1:27:00.000]  Get your protection privacy pockets at infowarstore.com and cut Big Brother off dead in his filthy tracks, infowarstore.com.
[1:27:02.000 --> 1:27:15.000]  I've got my apps together, I'm gonna walk all over you.
[1:27:15.000 --> 1:27:17.000]  Give me back my bullets.
[1:27:17.000 --> 1:27:23.000]  They want to make it where you can't work.
[1:27:23.000 --> 1:27:24.000]  They want to make you obsolete.
[1:27:24.000 --> 1:27:27.000]  They got to get you to stay in your house so the robots can take over.
[1:27:27.000 --> 1:27:28.000]  Don't do it.
[1:27:28.000 --> 1:27:31.000]  Speak up and say no, stop being timid.
[1:27:31.000 --> 1:27:39.000]  Ted Nugent's popping in for about 20 minutes, then I'll continue with your calls next segment, but I'm going to your calls here in a moment.
[1:27:39.000 --> 1:27:40.000]  So stay with us.
[1:27:40.000 --> 1:27:43.000]  Again, I'm your host Alex Jones, but let's go ahead and hit this now.
[1:27:43.000 --> 1:27:48.000]  I was going to get up and do a whole shot with maps up on the wall, but I think I'll do a special report on it.
[1:27:48.000 --> 1:27:49.000]  It's so important.
[1:27:49.000 --> 1:27:55.000]  And I've already harped on most of this, but people just think of the US government being the federal government.
[1:27:55.000 --> 1:27:56.000]  Now that's the federal government.
[1:27:56.000 --> 1:28:02.000]  They have a federal system, meaning the feds don't have all the power, you think a federal system means the feds have the power, it doesn't.
[1:28:02.000 --> 1:28:08.000]  The federal government means it's broken up between local and national, the separation of powers with checks and balances.
[1:28:08.000 --> 1:28:19.000]  But multinational corporations in the UN have come in all over the world in different types of governments, and they've taken control of them, all except communist governments.
[1:28:19.000 --> 1:28:24.000]  Because the UN is communist in nature, so it supports communist governments, it doesn't try to overthrow them.
[1:28:24.000 --> 1:28:32.000]  But here in the US, they're going to oversee our election and AOC and the rest of the squad want the end of the UN to tell us who's really being elected.
[1:28:32.000 --> 1:28:38.000]  And the UN's taking control of police departments and all these blue cities are basically UN run.
[1:28:38.000 --> 1:28:45.000]  So the UN comes out and says, oh, next fall and winter's lockdown will be bigger.
[1:28:45.000 --> 1:28:50.000]  Hell, they told us what they were going to do.
[1:28:50.000 --> 1:28:52.000]  Think about that.
[1:28:52.000 --> 1:28:54.000]  And so now they're here.
[1:28:54.000 --> 1:28:56.000]  This is the end of freedom.
[1:28:56.000 --> 1:29:05.000]  This is a takeover, a medical takeover, but instead of UN troops, it's the UN with big corporations saying, oh, we're protecting you from a virus.
[1:29:05.000 --> 1:29:12.000]  It doesn't matter every facet of what they say, it's giantly exaggerated, hundreds of times a huge lie, a fraud.
[1:29:12.000 --> 1:29:20.000]  They just need enough lemmings that are stupid to believe that, oh, the doctors are here to help me and give in to it.
[1:29:20.000 --> 1:29:26.000]  Yeah, there's articles out about AOC wearing tens of thousands of dollars of clothing, but then she says anybody that's wealthy is bad.
[1:29:26.000 --> 1:29:28.000]  I mean, it's all a sick joke.
[1:29:28.000 --> 1:29:33.000]  I've got a big report I'm going to hit at the end of this segment that's extremely informative.
[1:29:33.000 --> 1:29:40.000]  Man exposes weather channel fake news by wandering in the live shot.
[1:29:40.000 --> 1:29:47.000]  And there's the weatherman out there acting like it's 100 mile an hour winds when it's more like 10 mile an hour winds.
[1:29:47.000 --> 1:29:52.000]  And somebody just wanders in like it's no big deal wearing their stupid face diaper mask.
[1:29:52.000 --> 1:29:59.000]  And boy, do they pan the camera out of there quick because they know it's all a fraud.
[1:29:59.000 --> 1:30:05.000]  Turns out for $35 an hour out in California, they've got photo shoot rooms that look like the inside of a private jet.
[1:30:05.000 --> 1:30:11.000]  So everyone can pay $35 to go pose for two minutes like they're in a private jet.
[1:30:11.000 --> 1:30:14.000]  Fake it till you make it, huh?
[1:30:14.000 --> 1:30:19.000]  Everything on the left is about fraud and about lies and about hoaxes.
[1:30:19.000 --> 1:30:21.000]  Disgusting.
[1:30:21.000 --> 1:30:22.000]  And their people love it.
[1:30:22.000 --> 1:30:23.000]  They all buy into it.
[1:30:23.000 --> 1:30:27.000]  Bigger the scam, the more they love it, though they become bigger smucks by the minute.
[1:30:27.000 --> 1:30:29.000]  All right, who's up next here?
[1:30:29.000 --> 1:30:32.000]  Who's been holding the longest?
[1:30:32.000 --> 1:30:36.000]  That'd be Robert in Seattle, a once great city.
[1:30:36.000 --> 1:30:38.000]  Go ahead, Robert.
[1:30:38.000 --> 1:30:40.000]  Can you hear me?
[1:30:40.000 --> 1:30:42.000]  Yes, sir.
[1:30:42.000 --> 1:30:48.000]  So I think there's going to be some kind of major false flag before the election.
[1:30:48.000 --> 1:30:52.000]  With the way they got us cooped up with the mask, the viruses.
[1:30:52.000 --> 1:30:56.000]  I also believe the Luciferian agenda is at hand.
[1:30:56.000 --> 1:31:04.000]  And the fact that they put these masks on our face so that we can't look each other in the eyes of God's creation.
[1:31:04.000 --> 1:31:05.000]  And also the fact.
[1:31:05.000 --> 1:31:06.000]  Oh, yeah.
[1:31:06.000 --> 1:31:07.000]  I mean, it's like you're dirty.
[1:31:07.000 --> 1:31:08.000]  You're bad.
[1:31:08.000 --> 1:31:10.000]  It covers who's made the image of God.
[1:31:10.000 --> 1:31:13.000]  Absolutely occulting to symbol a bond, a symbol of slavery.
[1:31:13.000 --> 1:31:22.000]  But what I would like to bring up is I did not vote for Trump to share because I could not morally vote for someone who's going to force me to take a vaccine.
[1:31:22.000 --> 1:31:24.000]  He said it numerous times.
[1:31:24.000 --> 1:31:31.000]  There's also been leaked documents how the army is preparing 500 million mRNA based vaccines.
[1:31:31.000 --> 1:31:34.000]  That is taking the God in out of your body.
[1:31:34.000 --> 1:31:36.000]  You cannot connect with God anymore.
[1:31:36.000 --> 1:31:38.000]  I'm a spiritually man.
[1:31:38.000 --> 1:31:39.000]  I know you are.
[1:31:39.000 --> 1:31:43.000]  I don't know why he's promoting his vaccine.
[1:31:43.000 --> 1:31:47.000]  But everyone needs to repent because what's coming?
[1:31:47.000 --> 1:31:48.000]  You've got one choice.
[1:31:48.000 --> 1:31:51.000]  You're going to live on your feet or die on your knees.
[1:31:51.000 --> 1:31:57.000]  And when they come to your door to pump this vaccine into your body, you said it, no one said it.
[1:31:57.000 --> 1:32:02.000]  Better stand by your word that you're going to go out and ablaze the bullet because that's how it's the only way you're going to get away.
[1:32:02.000 --> 1:32:04.000]  Well, let me let me be clear.
[1:32:04.000 --> 1:32:05.000]  Can I say something?
[1:32:05.000 --> 1:32:08.000]  Can I say something?
[1:32:08.000 --> 1:32:10.000]  I'm on air fighting every day, so this doesn't happen.
[1:32:10.000 --> 1:32:14.000]  So I'm not going to go out in the blaze of glory just waiting for them to come with a gun.
[1:32:14.000 --> 1:32:19.000]  So I could shoot idiot college kids that are coming to try to give me a forced inoculation with some cop.
[1:32:19.000 --> 1:32:22.000]  I'm going to go out politically and fight it as hard as I can.
[1:32:22.000 --> 1:32:27.000]  And I'm not going to wait at my house to die if I ever decide to go on the offense.
[1:32:27.000 --> 1:32:29.000]  So let's explain those battle rules.
[1:32:29.000 --> 1:32:32.000]  It's always here like when the U.N. comes, I'm going to wait at home for them.
[1:32:32.000 --> 1:32:34.000]  No, that's not what I'm going to do.
[1:32:34.000 --> 1:32:37.000]  Trump has not said anywhere we're going to have forced inoculation.
[1:32:37.000 --> 1:32:39.000]  He said it should be voluntary.
[1:32:39.000 --> 1:32:45.000]  And to take it away from Fauci and Gates that want to keep us locked down for years, the vaccine, he said warp speed.
[1:32:45.000 --> 1:32:46.000]  I agree.
[1:32:46.000 --> 1:32:47.000]  Some of us have been co-opted.
[1:32:47.000 --> 1:32:50.000]  He did that to get control of the situation.
[1:32:50.000 --> 1:32:51.000]  Doesn't mean I agree with it.
[1:32:51.000 --> 1:32:56.000]  A lot of folks have misrepresented that I support inoculation or I support forced inoculation.
[1:32:56.000 --> 1:32:57.000]  I do not.
[1:32:57.000 --> 1:32:58.000]  I get what Trump's doing.
[1:32:58.000 --> 1:32:59.000]  It doesn't mean I agree with it.
[1:32:59.000 --> 1:33:02.000]  I see the psychology and you see you see Gates is mad.
[1:33:02.000 --> 1:33:07.000]  Fauci's mad because they wanted to keep things locked down for years until their mRNA vaccine comes out.
[1:33:07.000 --> 1:33:08.000]  It's even more deadly.
[1:33:08.000 --> 1:33:12.000]  And so Trump has said it's voluntary and it's if you want it.
[1:33:12.000 --> 1:33:16.000]  And old people are probably the ones that should take it because they're hit by COVID.
[1:33:16.000 --> 1:33:17.000]  Those are quotes, sir.
[1:33:17.000 --> 1:33:19.000]  I'm going to ask you politely and I really appreciate you, Robert.
[1:33:19.000 --> 1:33:23.000]  Where is Trump saying it's a forced inoculation?
[1:33:23.000 --> 1:33:25.000]  Because boy, if he says that, I'm against Trump right now.
[1:33:25.000 --> 1:33:26.000]  Please tell me where it is.
[1:33:26.000 --> 1:33:28.000]  He just said it would be.
[1:33:28.000 --> 1:33:30.000]  He's going to have the nearest military.
[1:33:30.000 --> 1:33:33.000]  Military excuse me, but back off your memory.
[1:33:33.000 --> 1:33:34.000]  My head said it working right here.
[1:33:34.000 --> 1:33:36.000]  You sound over driven.
[1:33:36.000 --> 1:33:39.000]  Tell me where Trump said not he's gonna.
[1:33:39.000 --> 1:33:43.000]  Where did he say it's forced inoculation?
[1:33:43.000 --> 1:33:44.000]  Okay.
[1:33:44.000 --> 1:33:45.000]  His word.
[1:33:45.000 --> 1:33:50.000]  It'll be powerfully distributed distributed by the military.
[1:33:50.000 --> 1:33:53.000]  Why is it we need the military to give us a vaccine?
[1:33:53.000 --> 1:33:55.000]  You can go to your doctor and get it.
[1:33:55.000 --> 1:33:58.000]  Why do why does the military need to be involved?
[1:33:58.000 --> 1:34:01.000]  That sounds pretty forced to me.
[1:34:01.000 --> 1:34:05.000]  That is the he did say that and Boris Johnson has said that.
[1:34:05.000 --> 1:34:07.000]  They're talking about trying to force it over there.
[1:34:07.000 --> 1:34:08.000]  And I'm totally against it.
[1:34:08.000 --> 1:34:12.000]  And he said that because that's under his command saying NIH won't be in
[1:34:12.000 --> 1:34:13.000]  control of it.
[1:34:13.000 --> 1:34:15.000]  So it's not whatever vaccine they've got.
[1:34:15.000 --> 1:34:20.000]  And that's all him killing the idea upfront because he knows how sales work by
[1:34:20.000 --> 1:34:21.000]  not being available.
[1:34:21.000 --> 1:34:24.000]  More people want it by saying it's about to be available.
[1:34:24.000 --> 1:34:27.000]  It demystifies it and then he controls the distribution.
[1:34:27.000 --> 1:34:30.000]  And that way, if you've got to get it all over the country, whoever wants it,
[1:34:30.000 --> 1:34:31.000]  the military takes care of it.
[1:34:31.000 --> 1:34:34.000]  It's not all these special interests with all these other vaccines.
[1:34:34.000 --> 1:34:35.000]  That's what Trump's doing.
[1:34:35.000 --> 1:34:37.000]  Does not mean I agree with that.
[1:34:37.000 --> 1:34:41.000]  Well, I didn't vote for him because I believe he told me that.
[1:34:41.000 --> 1:34:42.000]  I appreciate your call.
[1:34:42.000 --> 1:34:44.000]  Listen, that's great.
[1:34:44.000 --> 1:34:47.000]  Joe Biden is for forced inoculation and permanent mask and permanent
[1:34:47.000 --> 1:34:48.000]  lockdown.
[1:34:48.000 --> 1:34:49.000]  And that's your vote, brother.
[1:34:49.000 --> 1:34:50.000]  And I respect you.
[1:34:50.000 --> 1:34:51.000]  I really appreciate your call.
[1:34:51.000 --> 1:34:52.000]  Okay.
[1:34:52.000 --> 1:34:54.000]  Let's talk to Peter in New Hampshire.
[1:34:54.000 --> 1:34:55.000]  Peter, go ahead.
[1:34:55.000 --> 1:34:56.000]  How are you doing out?
[1:34:56.000 --> 1:34:57.000]  Good, brother.
[1:34:57.000 --> 1:35:01.000]  So I'm a university student to answer your question of how the left is going
[1:35:01.000 --> 1:35:03.000]  to respond to Donald Trump winning the election.
[1:35:03.000 --> 1:35:07.000]  I think they're going to incite as much unrest and riots as they can.
[1:35:07.000 --> 1:35:10.000]  And I think it's going to be interesting to see what goes on at the
[1:35:10.000 --> 1:35:14.000]  university because these kids, they get their information exclusively from
[1:35:14.000 --> 1:35:18.000]  Instagram and Twitter and who controls those sites, big tech and those
[1:35:18.000 --> 1:35:20.000]  influencers controlled by the left.
[1:35:20.000 --> 1:35:25.000]  So these kids post things like we can have disagreements, but if you're a racist,
[1:35:25.000 --> 1:35:26.000]  you'll die.
[1:35:26.000 --> 1:35:31.000]  And that's the easiest way to dismiss any kind of opposition to what they
[1:35:31.000 --> 1:35:32.000]  believe in.
[1:35:32.000 --> 1:35:36.000]  We have organizations on campus that will go up to you and say, oh, give me
[1:35:36.000 --> 1:35:40.000]  your email so I can send you some unsolicited emails about, you know,
[1:35:40.000 --> 1:35:42.000]  riots and protests happening everywhere.
[1:35:42.000 --> 1:35:45.000]  They scheduled protests out front of Mr. Connell's house.
[1:35:45.000 --> 1:35:49.000]  And I'm going to be really interested to see what they're going to do on the
[1:35:49.000 --> 1:35:52.000]  university level.
[1:35:52.000 --> 1:35:53.000]  I agree, brother.
[1:35:53.000 --> 1:35:56.000]  And, you know, I'm very troubled like the last caller by Trump taking control
[1:35:56.000 --> 1:35:59.000]  of the vaccine situation, but I understand why he's doing it.
[1:35:59.000 --> 1:36:00.000]  I think it's still dangerous.
[1:36:00.000 --> 1:36:05.000]  What do you think about Trump controlling the vaccine?
[1:36:05.000 --> 1:36:10.000]  Well, it's going to have to be, I think it's going to have to be strictly up
[1:36:10.000 --> 1:36:13.000]  to the people, but that's what Trump said.
[1:36:13.000 --> 1:36:14.000]  They're going to have the U.N.
[1:36:14.000 --> 1:36:15.000]  Row without him.
[1:36:15.000 --> 1:36:17.000]  Bill Gates of Trump doesn't control it.
[1:36:17.000 --> 1:36:19.000]  The caller get that?
[1:36:19.000 --> 1:36:22.000]  Yeah, I don't think he understands the idea that the left wants to put
[1:36:22.000 --> 1:36:26.000]  stuff in the vaccine that you don't want in your body.
[1:36:26.000 --> 1:36:28.000]  They want to put microchips in it.
[1:36:28.000 --> 1:36:29.000]  Absolutely.
[1:36:29.000 --> 1:36:32.000]  He's saying no to the Gates vaccine with the classic vaccine,
[1:36:32.000 --> 1:36:34.000]  which is still a lesser of two evils and I don't agree with,
[1:36:34.000 --> 1:36:36.000]  but I get what Trump's doing.
[1:36:36.000 --> 1:36:37.000]  Doesn't mean I agree with it.
[1:36:37.000 --> 1:36:38.000]  Thank you so much, Peter.
[1:36:38.000 --> 1:36:42.000]  We love you.
[1:36:42.000 --> 1:36:44.000]  China is open.
[1:36:44.000 --> 1:36:46.000]  America is closed.
[1:36:46.000 --> 1:36:49.000]  And in the European Union where the people are revolting trying to get out
[1:36:49.000 --> 1:36:53.000]  of the authoritarian tyranny, they're also under even greater levels
[1:36:53.000 --> 1:36:54.000]  of lockdown.
[1:36:54.000 --> 1:36:55.000]  It's very simple.
[1:36:55.000 --> 1:36:59.000]  Where authoritarians already have complete control of Communist China,
[1:36:59.000 --> 1:37:02.000]  oh, there's no more lockdowns and their heroes and the U.N.
[1:37:02.000 --> 1:37:04.000]  says they're the example for assault.
[1:37:04.000 --> 1:37:07.000]  After all, that's where the virus came from.
[1:37:07.000 --> 1:37:09.000]  After all, that's where the fear mongering came from.
[1:37:09.000 --> 1:37:14.000]  The lockdown came from, but that was a weapon, a psychological hysteria,
[1:37:14.000 --> 1:37:20.000]  a chicken little syndrome being created that was to be aimed at us
[1:37:20.000 --> 1:37:26.000]  and used to invoke our fear and have us go into a stampede of mass hysteria.
[1:37:26.000 --> 1:37:30.000]  And so far, it's been incredibly successful.
[1:37:30.000 --> 1:37:33.000]  Until just the last few weeks as across the world,
[1:37:33.000 --> 1:37:37.000]  humanity awakens in the fact that COVID-19 is a giant U.N.
[1:37:37.000 --> 1:37:41.000]  Communist Chinese world government power grab.
[1:37:41.000 --> 1:37:44.000]  I once saw a bumper sticker that read,
[1:37:44.000 --> 1:37:47.000]  if you want your children to listen to you, whisper.
[1:37:47.000 --> 1:37:49.000]  And it's true.
[1:37:49.000 --> 1:37:52.000]  A lot of times if somebody's shouting and yelling,
[1:37:52.000 --> 1:37:56.000]  even of what they're talking about is important, people tend to tune it out.
[1:37:56.000 --> 1:37:57.000]  You know why I know that?
[1:37:57.000 --> 1:37:59.000]  Because I'm Alex Jones.
[1:37:59.000 --> 1:38:04.000]  And I've been pretty obnoxious over the years because I'm worried about the New World Order
[1:38:04.000 --> 1:38:07.000]  and I read about all their plans to lockdown civilization,
[1:38:07.000 --> 1:38:11.000]  start the third world and then enslave the first world.
[1:38:11.000 --> 1:38:14.000]  So I've been really, really loud and really, really aggressive
[1:38:14.000 --> 1:38:19.000]  and we've had a big effect, but now it's time to think about every different angle
[1:38:19.000 --> 1:38:24.000]  and every different way we can get people to think for themselves before it's too late.
[1:38:24.000 --> 1:38:30.000]  The lockdown, social distancing, the mask has been to end human civilization.
[1:38:30.000 --> 1:38:34.000]  We are under a civilization collapse weapon.
[1:38:34.000 --> 1:38:39.000]  So this is Life and Death. Please share in FullWars.com and Bandai Video
[1:38:39.000 --> 1:39:08.000]  to watch our live election coverage.
[1:39:09.000 --> 1:39:11.800]  Here we are at the U.S.
[1:39:11.800 --> 1:39:13.800]  The U.S.
[1:39:13.800 --> 1:39:19.600]  Aluminium Tumoric Formula with a 95% cucumber-noyed level.
[1:39:19.600 --> 1:39:24.600]  And we have other organic products in there that accelerated and bring into the cells of the body.
[1:39:24.600 --> 1:39:27.600]  It's been sold out for months. It's back in stock in spite that.
[1:39:27.600 --> 1:39:34.600]  Body's Ultimate Tumoric Formula at infowarstore.com is 50% off with free shipping

[1:39:42.720 --> 1:39:47.960]  Much of the time on big issues and societal developments, info wars is many, many years
[1:39:47.960 --> 1:39:53.960]  ahead and almost all the time we are tomorrow's news today, but there's a blind spot that
[1:39:53.960 --> 1:39:54.960]  info wars has.
[1:39:54.960 --> 1:39:57.720]  I've noticed that really informed people have this as well.
[1:39:57.720 --> 1:40:01.120]  I know a lot of you tuning in are some of the most conformable out there, so I want
[1:40:01.120 --> 1:40:05.560]  you to be retrospective and kind of examine yourself because that's what I do every day.
[1:40:05.560 --> 1:40:11.840]  This hunter by laptop is important, but the new audio confirmed to be him, where he admits
[1:40:11.840 --> 1:40:16.480]  he works under the communist Chinese spy sheaf, he should be arrested right now.
[1:40:16.480 --> 1:40:23.440]  That is so huge, that is hiding in plain view and it's getting almost no attention.
[1:40:23.440 --> 1:40:28.120]  We have to get that information out to everybody, it's all posted on info wars.com, so many
[1:40:28.120 --> 1:40:33.400]  other major patriotic sites, but we need to get it out to everybody and remember that
[1:40:33.400 --> 1:40:37.600]  we know all of this, we knew it a long time ago, so when it breaks down we kind of go
[1:40:37.600 --> 1:40:45.560]  okay tell us what we didn't know, the point is now it's documented, now it's proven.
[1:40:45.560 --> 1:40:54.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:40:54.240 --> 1:40:59.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government coverups.
[1:40:59.000 --> 1:41:05.880]  You want to stop tyranny, well so does he, live from the info wars.com studios, it's
[1:41:05.880 --> 1:41:09.520]  Alex Jones.
[1:41:09.520 --> 1:41:13.480]  Well this is the national anthem of rock and roll world wide stranglehold with the one
[1:41:13.480 --> 1:41:18.720]  the only Ted Nugent, but nobody plays the Star Spangled Banner better on electric guitar
[1:41:18.720 --> 1:41:23.120]  than Ted Nugent, even better in my view than Jimi Hendrix, and he joins us for the next
[1:41:23.120 --> 1:41:27.680]  20 minutes or so, I'm going to be on his great show coming up next Monday on the eve of
[1:41:27.680 --> 1:41:32.920]  the election, so much coming up, I'm going to be co-host with Joe Rogan election night
[1:41:32.920 --> 1:41:38.160]  as well, he's now a full board Trump supporter folks, people are really waking up, Ted Nugent,
[1:41:38.160 --> 1:41:43.920]  the Motor City madman, very honored to have him, it's emblematic, we've got polls, 35-40
[1:41:43.920 --> 1:41:47.440]  percent of black Americans going to vote, Trump, people like Joe Rogan that were liberals
[1:41:47.440 --> 1:41:52.120]  voting for Trump, just because Biden's so bad, the riots all over the country, Democrats
[1:41:52.120 --> 1:41:56.520]  defending it, all these chai-com agents getting busted, Hunter Biden, what in the hell's
[1:41:56.520 --> 1:41:59.240]  going on Ted Nugent, thanks for joining us.
[1:41:59.240 --> 1:42:03.160]  Well TruthLogic and Common Sense is celebrated right here with Uncle Ted and Alex Jones,
[1:42:03.160 --> 1:42:09.680]  a big salute and God bless you Alex, because the common sense that we swan dive in and
[1:42:09.680 --> 1:42:14.920]  breaststroke up those raging rapids every day is alive and well across this great country,
[1:42:14.920 --> 1:42:19.760]  so yeah there's a lot of bad and ugly, but you just identified there is a great awakening
[1:42:19.760 --> 1:42:25.360]  taking place, I know Joe Rogan, he's a dear friend and I set the world record podcast with
[1:42:25.360 --> 1:42:31.000]  him on a three and a half hour orgy of TruthLogic and Common Sense, but I'd like to start on
[1:42:31.000 --> 1:42:36.960]  this wonderful October day by celebrating that I'm a happy, happy bow and arrow son
[1:42:36.960 --> 1:42:41.680]  of a bitch, I'm having a great hunting season up here in Michigan, just shared a campfire
[1:42:41.680 --> 1:42:46.320]  and this is really important Alex, I just shared another campfire like I do every week
[1:42:46.320 --> 1:42:51.920]  in September, October, November, December with heroes of America, cops and teachers
[1:42:51.920 --> 1:42:57.400]  and hardware store operators, farmers and ranchers, heroes of the military, this month
[1:42:57.400 --> 1:43:04.400]  I have spent campfires with Army, Navy, Air Force, the Coast Guard, the Marine Corps and
[1:43:04.400 --> 1:43:11.280]  talk about salt to the earth special dedicated warriors for US constitutionally declared
[1:43:11.280 --> 1:43:17.320]  freedom, there is an amazing wake up taking place because these people who have always
[1:43:17.320 --> 1:43:21.880]  been in the asset column have come to realize that if you're an asset, that's not good
[1:43:21.880 --> 1:43:27.680]  enough, you have to chastise and scold and educate the people in your life at church
[1:43:27.680 --> 1:43:31.760]  and school, at the workplace, at the bowling alley, at the barbecue, at the deer camp,
[1:43:31.760 --> 1:43:32.760]  at the rifle range.
[1:43:32.760 --> 1:43:37.240]  Because, let me say this, because when you are engaged, exactly, because when you're
[1:43:37.240 --> 1:43:42.080]  an asset, these globalists want to make you their slave, you have to stand up for yourself
[1:43:42.080 --> 1:43:45.120]  as well, I mean I think that's what you're getting at right now.
[1:43:45.120 --> 1:43:50.880]  Absolutely, my point being is that I think the Marxists have done us a great favor by
[1:43:50.880 --> 1:43:55.160]  showing that the ultimate representative of the Democrat Party, which there doesn't exist
[1:43:55.160 --> 1:44:00.440]  anymore by the way, it's not a Democrat Party, it's a Marxist gang.
[1:44:00.440 --> 1:44:04.640]  Thank God for Joe Biden, this is perfect, this is waking up people that were sitting
[1:44:04.640 --> 1:44:09.680]  on the fence, independents, even some of the old guard denial-ridden Democrats that there
[1:44:09.680 --> 1:44:17.040]  is no Democrat Party, that Joe Biden is the manifestation of runaway criminal corruption,
[1:44:17.040 --> 1:44:23.280]  abuse of power, and treading, trampling on we the people, the Constitution, the Bill
[1:44:23.280 --> 1:44:25.200]  of Rights, and freedom overall.
[1:44:25.200 --> 1:44:32.320]  So yes, we can thank the enemy for being so stupid that they're not hiding it anymore.
[1:44:32.320 --> 1:44:37.600]  Instead of saying we demand a common sense gun safety reform, what they actually meant
[1:44:37.600 --> 1:44:41.800]  is what Joe Biden and Beto O'Rourke said, they're coming to take your guns, now they
[1:44:41.800 --> 1:44:42.800]  admit it.
[1:44:42.800 --> 1:44:48.160]  Thank God for a brief spasm of honesty because they're so stupid they don't know they're
[1:44:48.160 --> 1:44:50.000]  pissing off the best of the best.
[1:44:50.000 --> 1:44:53.080]  I think you just answered my question, why would they say suddenly, hell yes, we want
[1:44:53.080 --> 1:44:58.280]  to confiscate your guns, and you call it stupidity, I agree, but I think lying never
[1:44:58.280 --> 1:45:01.960]  got them there, so they're trying to be out of the open, I mean, why do you think they're
[1:45:01.960 --> 1:45:07.920]  being so honest about hating America, hating capitalism, hating freedom, just doing horrible
[1:45:07.920 --> 1:45:11.560]  things, like how do we produce so much, I agree, there's so many great people in this
[1:45:11.560 --> 1:45:15.320]  country where race color agreed, but how do we produce so much scum, I guess it's been
[1:45:15.320 --> 1:45:18.640]  good people been putting up with them, and so it's really our fault, I'm not saying your
[1:45:18.640 --> 1:45:22.400]  fault or other folks that work around the clock, but the average person like you said
[1:45:22.400 --> 1:45:26.400]  that works hard to the asset column, they now get, hey, sorry, that ain't enough, you're
[1:45:26.400 --> 1:45:30.200]  going to have to go on the offense against these people and put them back in their place.
[1:45:30.200 --> 1:45:35.320]  Yeah, there's been a lot of shrugged shoulders in my lifetime, I certainly have never shrugged
[1:45:35.320 --> 1:45:41.040]  mine, Atlas, I've always been an activist, I've been a hellraiser, you know, Alex, I'm
[1:45:41.040 --> 1:45:45.200]  just a goofy guitar player, I think it's important to repeat that I never went to college because
[1:45:45.200 --> 1:45:50.280]  I was too busy learning stuff, the important stuff, and I wouldn't allow myself to be brainwashed
[1:45:50.280 --> 1:45:55.960]  by the Marxist regime coming out of the beatniks into the hippy world of dope droolers.
[1:45:55.960 --> 1:46:01.520]  My point being is that around my campfires, this is a microcosm, Alex, this is the heart
[1:46:01.520 --> 1:46:08.360]  and soul of America, and so many of my hunting buddies have admitted they've never registered,
[1:46:08.360 --> 1:46:13.080]  they've never voted, but they're the first ones to piss and moan and squawk.
[1:46:13.080 --> 1:46:20.760]  We have, we talked about it before, huntthevote.org, we have registered at huntthevote.org, more
[1:46:20.760 --> 1:46:26.080]  than a quarter of a million of licensed hunters across this country that have never voted
[1:46:26.080 --> 1:46:30.440]  before, Alex, and they believe in God's family, country, freedom, life, liberty, pursuit of
[1:46:30.440 --> 1:46:35.080]  happiness, but they don't do anything about it, now they're doing something about it,
[1:46:35.080 --> 1:46:39.640]  and being at the Trump rallies, I realize that's a captive audience, but my goodness,
[1:46:39.640 --> 1:46:47.000]  the sheer volume, the passion, the energy, the fight, the fire, it is, I've seen a lot
[1:46:47.000 --> 1:46:53.320]  of that in my lifetime, but in 2020, because the other side is so vicious, so evil, so
[1:46:53.320 --> 1:46:58.320]  criminal, so corrupt, and by the way, I don't give a damn what their motive is.
[1:46:58.320 --> 1:47:03.200]  If I see a man with an arm caught in a firebomb in it, I'm going to shoot him two times in
[1:47:03.200 --> 1:47:08.040]  the chest, I don't need to know why he wants to burn my house down, I just know I need
[1:47:08.040 --> 1:47:09.040]  to stop.
[1:47:09.040 --> 1:47:12.640]  I totally agree, I just want to understand why they're going against their own self-interest
[1:47:12.640 --> 1:47:16.600]  and trying to destroy the greatest country's ever been, I mean, these people are true idiots.
[1:47:16.600 --> 1:47:24.480]  Well, who could not study but a brief snapshot of any historical moment and scene where Marxism
[1:47:24.480 --> 1:47:29.040]  and communism and tyranny and slave driving and slave ownership, that's really what the
[1:47:29.040 --> 1:47:32.680]  Democrat Party has turned into, they were always the party of the Klan, now they're
[1:47:32.680 --> 1:47:36.120]  coming out, they just think because they're not wearing sheets over their heads that we
[1:47:36.120 --> 1:47:37.880]  don't recognize them.
[1:47:37.880 --> 1:47:43.880]  So I'm telling you, I'm just a guitar player, but I can sniff out truth logic and common
[1:47:43.880 --> 1:47:48.360]  sense like a backstrap on the hoof and the swamps of Michigan and the wilds of Texas,
[1:47:48.360 --> 1:47:53.160]  and I see a great prognosis, we've known each other for a number of years and it's never
[1:47:53.160 --> 1:47:59.480]  been uglier than it is now, however, there is a wake-up call happening and I believe
[1:47:59.480 --> 1:48:03.800]  that the voters are finally getting their head out of their ass, they're voting God's
[1:48:03.800 --> 1:48:11.840]  family, country, freedom, independence, law and order, Alex, it's 2020 and law and order
[1:48:11.840 --> 1:48:15.400]  is controversial, it's like Planet of the Cuckoo's Nest.
[1:48:15.400 --> 1:48:19.640]  It is, you were on like a year ago, and I've known you about 15 years, but you were on
[1:48:19.640 --> 1:48:23.560]  about a year ago and you predicted this big awakening now happening, but the numbers are
[1:48:23.560 --> 1:48:28.320]  in, I've got articles on m4s.com linked to all the latest polls, I'll have the early
[1:48:28.320 --> 1:48:33.040]  voting numbers tell us, normally it's Democrats do early voting, but it's Republicans way
[1:48:33.040 --> 1:48:39.280]  ahead all over the country, massively up to 20 points ahead, more Republicans voting
[1:48:39.280 --> 1:48:44.720]  early voting than Democrats, so that certainly reverses the trend, historic 31% of black voters
[1:48:44.720 --> 1:48:50.600]  that tend to cast their votes for Trump in new polls, but the reports of Democrat election
[1:48:50.600 --> 1:48:54.480]  fraud are pouring in, that's their secret weapon.
[1:48:54.480 --> 1:49:01.200]  You know, I think it can be really zeroed in on the synopsis of the cultural deprivation
[1:49:01.200 --> 1:49:07.680]  we've witnessed in expansion over the years, is ultimately represented by the cruelty,
[1:49:07.680 --> 1:49:14.520]  the dishonesty, the scamming of a group that call themselves black lives matter, when their
[1:49:14.520 --> 1:49:21.280]  actual agenda is against black lives, they actually encourage genocide, they encourage
[1:49:21.280 --> 1:49:26.840]  about Planned Parenthood's slaughter of black children, they literally ignore the black
[1:49:26.840 --> 1:49:31.800]  on black slaughter in Chicago and elsewhere, while they're somehow claiming that all those
[1:49:31.800 --> 1:49:36.400]  people burning down the cities and trashing and looting Philadelphia and Portland and
[1:49:36.400 --> 1:49:42.040]  Seattle, somehow that that's benefiting the black business owners that they're killing
[1:49:42.040 --> 1:49:48.680]  and looting, so I gotta tell you, if you smoke enough dope, if you buy enough propaganda
[1:49:48.680 --> 1:49:53.560]  from the mainstream propaganda ministry and the academia in Hollywood, if you pay attention
[1:49:53.560 --> 1:49:59.360]  to that long enough, you are so brain dead that you actually think killing a retired
[1:49:59.360 --> 1:50:05.280]  cop in St. Louis, killing a retired black police officer in St. Louis proves that you
[1:50:05.280 --> 1:50:09.840]  think black lives matter, I'm telling you, the next thing the Democrats are gonna do
[1:50:09.840 --> 1:50:13.960]  is they're gonna find John Wayne Gacy to control the children's schoolyard.
[1:50:13.960 --> 1:50:18.920]  I agree, so let me ask this before we go to break and do a few more seconds with Ted
[1:50:18.920 --> 1:50:23.240]  Nugent here, we really appreciate his time, Uncle Ted, what are they gonna do when they
[1:50:23.240 --> 1:50:24.240]  lose?
[1:50:24.240 --> 1:50:28.000]  I think Trump's gonna win on a landslide even bigger than last time, but they're gonna
[1:50:28.000 --> 1:50:32.040]  go crazy and try to burn the country down, and the Blue City mayors are ordering police
[1:50:32.040 --> 1:50:36.560]  to stand down as we've now confirmed Trump was right in Philadelphia, what do we do?
[1:50:36.560 --> 1:50:39.000]  Call in the National Guard?
[1:50:39.000 --> 1:50:45.440]  You know, Alex, I know how I control my home and my property, and that is that everybody
[1:50:45.440 --> 1:50:52.880]  knows that if you provide a life-threatening scenario to my family that I'll cut you in
[1:50:52.880 --> 1:50:59.200]  half, and I haven't had to cut anybody in half because they know I will, and again I'm
[1:50:59.200 --> 1:51:05.240]  just a guitar player, I not only wrote Wango Tango, I actually meant it, I'm just a guy,
[1:51:05.240 --> 1:51:09.120]  I'm like a farmer with a bad tractor.
[1:51:09.120 --> 1:51:13.040]  Well, you say that, you're a pretty, pretty intimidating caveman guy in person, I mean,
[1:51:13.040 --> 1:51:16.840]  you definitely got some, some, some, some, the right stuff there, Ted, but America's
[1:51:16.840 --> 1:51:19.000]  full of it, like I said, full of the right stuff.
[1:51:19.000 --> 1:51:23.120]  Well, you know we are, and I gotta tell you, I think there's something going on behind the
[1:51:23.120 --> 1:51:29.120]  scenes because when you tell the heroes of law enforcement, only the term applies to
[1:51:29.120 --> 1:51:30.120]  those who are...
[1:51:30.120 --> 1:51:31.120]  Stay there, we gotta come back two minutes later.
[1:51:31.120 --> 1:51:34.360]  It's all record, it's not disputed, it was rolled out more than eight months ago in
[1:51:34.360 --> 1:51:38.680]  common to China, now it's in Europe, now it's the United States, Canada, and the most
[1:51:38.680 --> 1:51:41.200]  other industrial parts of the planet.
[1:51:41.200 --> 1:51:46.800]  Every restaurant you go into, even small mom and pops, have QR codes for you to supposedly
[1:51:46.800 --> 1:51:50.920]  check their menu, and they really get upset if you ask for a paper menu, but of course
[1:51:50.920 --> 1:51:51.920]  they have them.
[1:51:51.920 --> 1:51:52.920]  Now, what are they saying there?
[1:51:52.920 --> 1:51:57.160]  Well, you gotta have a cell phone to come to their establishment, and that you can't
[1:51:57.160 --> 1:52:01.720]  have a piece of paper because, oh, everybody's diseased and, you know, we're spreading terms.
[1:52:01.720 --> 1:52:05.600]  It's absolutely asinine, they can throw away the little one sheet papers if they actually
[1:52:05.600 --> 1:52:06.600]  believe that.
[1:52:06.600 --> 1:52:11.600]  Now, what this really is, is a contact tracing database, again, this is admitted that everyone's
[1:52:11.600 --> 1:52:16.000]  being habituated into scanning to be part of, so in the future, everywhere you go is
[1:52:16.000 --> 1:52:17.000]  tracked officially.
[1:52:17.000 --> 1:52:20.280]  Now, your cell phone's already tracking, you already have home assistants watching and
[1:52:20.280 --> 1:52:24.160]  listening to you in your house, but now this is officially rolling the sound where you
[1:52:24.160 --> 1:52:28.440]  won't buy or sell, have a job, get on an airplane without it, and Bill Gates even admits it,
[1:52:28.440 --> 1:52:33.080]  so think about that, folks, and we'll look out.
[1:52:33.080 --> 1:52:35.920]  Something huge has happened in the last two weeks.
[1:52:35.920 --> 1:52:42.000]  Remember when Hunter Biden's laptop first broke, and all of Big Tech, in concert from
[1:52:42.000 --> 1:52:48.000]  Twitter to Facebook to YouTube, Google, all worked to block it, they didn't deny that
[1:52:48.000 --> 1:52:53.080]  it was real, they just wouldn't let anybody even talk about the story or link to major
[1:52:53.080 --> 1:52:57.720]  newspapers or even the House and Senate committees that were looking at it.
[1:52:57.720 --> 1:53:03.160]  Well, now fast forward as the fire hose of information comes out and more tapes get released
[1:53:03.160 --> 1:53:07.800]  to more audio, with Hunter admitting he was a Communist Chinese agent, we're not trying
[1:53:07.800 --> 1:53:08.800]  to censor it anymore.
[1:53:08.800 --> 1:53:13.800]  Not because they're good people, but because this TriXan effect boomeranged on their traitorous
[1:53:13.800 --> 1:53:18.520]  butts last time, just a few weeks ago, and so now they know they're trying to suppress
[1:53:18.520 --> 1:53:23.320]  it, only makes it bigger, just like they've done with InfoWars in Band-Aught Video.
[1:53:23.320 --> 1:53:27.680]  It's truly amazing, so keep telling the truth, the Lord works in mysterious ways, amazing
[1:53:27.680 --> 1:53:35.000]  things are happening and these Communist Chinese agents are going to pay.
[1:53:35.000 --> 1:54:01.840]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:54:01.840 --> 1:54:19.280]  It's got to scare the Democrats at a core level, well first I'll finish the point you
[1:54:19.280 --> 1:54:22.960]  made when we got interrupted by the break, you were talking about sitting around these
[1:54:22.960 --> 1:54:27.360]  campfires with law enforcement and military people and how they're shifting from just
[1:54:27.360 --> 1:54:29.920]  doing their job to realizing the war is on.
[1:54:29.920 --> 1:54:34.360]  Yeah, you know, I think there's something going on that's out of our reach, no matter
[1:54:34.360 --> 1:54:41.760]  how many connections we may have and how we enter the inner circle of Donald Trump's regime
[1:54:41.760 --> 1:54:45.880]  right now, which I genuflect at the altar of this great man.
[1:54:45.880 --> 1:54:50.360]  He is just pulling off miracle after miracle, he's really touching the heart and soul and
[1:54:50.360 --> 1:54:55.000]  representing the heart and soul of the best American families out there, just praise God
[1:54:55.000 --> 1:54:56.000]  for that.
[1:54:56.000 --> 1:54:58.960]  This is one of those divine intervention moments like the founding fathers, believe me when
[1:54:58.960 --> 1:55:03.920]  I tell you that, but my point is is that the cruelty, the viciousness, the criminality,
[1:55:03.920 --> 1:55:11.520]  the arson, the eluding, the savagery, the demonisy of the left in Philadelphia and Portland,
[1:55:11.520 --> 1:55:18.160]  Seattle and Atlanta and Minneapolis, when the liberal punks told the sheep dogs to back
[1:55:18.160 --> 1:55:22.960]  off, not protect the sheep and welcome the wolves, that's really what those idiots have
[1:55:22.960 --> 1:55:26.720]  done in those cities as they burned to the ground and innocent lives are lost and families
[1:55:26.720 --> 1:55:27.720]  are destroyed.
[1:55:27.720 --> 1:55:34.480]  I believe that when Donald Trump wins, that that will end, that when you try to loop,
[1:55:34.480 --> 1:55:36.320]  we will stop you from looting.
[1:55:36.320 --> 1:55:42.920]  Again, Alex, I've been hanging out with sheriffs and state troopers and I have great conversations
[1:55:42.920 --> 1:55:48.400]  with the Secret Service and the FBI and the different agents at these rallies and I see
[1:55:48.400 --> 1:55:53.960]  a twinkle in their eye because I think when we get this great commander in chief reelected,
[1:55:53.960 --> 1:55:58.920]  we're just not going to allow looting and arson and the destruction of our great cities.
[1:55:58.920 --> 1:56:00.600]  We're just not going to allow it.
[1:56:00.600 --> 1:56:02.640]  And here, here's an example of Alex.
[1:56:02.640 --> 1:56:05.240]  I was born in Detroit, 1948.
[1:56:05.240 --> 1:56:10.440]  Right now, the great Detroit chief of police, James Craig, he is a hero of mine.
[1:56:10.440 --> 1:56:14.520]  He's a fellow Detroiters, a black chief of police in the motor city.
[1:56:14.520 --> 1:56:18.760]  He told me he will not let arsonists burn.
[1:56:18.760 --> 1:56:21.280]  He will not let statues topple.
[1:56:21.280 --> 1:56:25.880]  He will not let punks graffiti family businesses.
[1:56:25.880 --> 1:56:29.640]  This chief of police in Detroit, James Craig, is a real sheepdog.
[1:56:29.640 --> 1:56:35.400]  He's a real law enforcement hero and you notice that nobody's burning jack diddly in the motor
[1:56:35.400 --> 1:56:37.840]  city because of this great law enforcement hero.
[1:56:37.840 --> 1:56:38.840]  That's right.
[1:56:38.840 --> 1:56:42.920]  We've got this other deputy of police in Philadelphia who green lit it.
[1:56:42.920 --> 1:56:45.840]  Why do you think the Democrats are doing that, hoping it causes a chain reaction to blame
[1:56:45.840 --> 1:56:46.840]  Trump?
[1:56:46.840 --> 1:56:51.160]  You know, again, be very careful of my friend Alex Jones.
[1:56:51.160 --> 1:56:56.080]  You might have an aneurysm if you try to figure out any logic.
[1:56:56.080 --> 1:56:58.080]  There is no logic behind it.
[1:56:58.080 --> 1:56:59.080]  No, you're right.
[1:56:59.080 --> 1:57:00.080]  We should just oppose it.
[1:57:00.080 --> 1:57:01.080]  I just don't get why they do it.
[1:57:01.080 --> 1:57:02.080]  It doesn't make sense.
[1:57:02.080 --> 1:57:04.720]  And it will never make sense.
[1:57:04.720 --> 1:57:06.280]  So here's how we handle it.
[1:57:06.280 --> 1:57:07.600]  I know you respect your elders.
[1:57:07.600 --> 1:57:10.720]  I'm going to be 70 years a few weeks.
[1:57:10.720 --> 1:57:13.920]  Here's how you handle it.
[1:57:13.920 --> 1:57:20.840]  When old Yeller saves the child from the snake in the coyote and he brings you the newspaper,
[1:57:20.840 --> 1:57:23.120]  give old Yeller a biscuit.
[1:57:23.120 --> 1:57:27.840]  When old Yeller foams at the mouth, shoot him between the eyes.
[1:57:27.840 --> 1:57:33.520]  I mean, it's old Yeller, good old Yeller biscuit foaming at the mouth, old Yeller bullet.
[1:57:33.520 --> 1:57:35.720]  I don't care why he's foaming at the mouth.
[1:57:35.720 --> 1:57:39.360]  I don't know how he got the rabies, but I'm going to have to shoot the son of a bitch.
[1:57:39.360 --> 1:57:40.360]  Are you with me?
[1:57:40.360 --> 1:57:45.520]  Exactly, we need to stop playing games, even listening to them and trying to just stand
[1:57:45.520 --> 1:57:46.520]  up to them.
[1:57:46.520 --> 1:57:47.520]  Absolutely.
[1:57:47.520 --> 1:57:49.640]  And I think that's what's about to happen again.
[1:57:49.640 --> 1:57:50.640]  Here's an example.
[1:57:50.640 --> 1:57:51.640]  I can't.
[1:57:51.640 --> 1:57:52.640]  I don't have to fantasize.
[1:57:52.640 --> 1:57:59.160]  Detroit Chief of Police Warrior James Craig has made that stand.
[1:57:59.160 --> 1:58:06.480]  No arson, no looting, no graffiti, no riots, no Black Lives Matter marches and destroying
[1:58:06.480 --> 1:58:08.800]  their own neighborhoods.
[1:58:08.800 --> 1:58:13.080]  He studied the great Detroit Chief of Police, James Craig.
[1:58:13.080 --> 1:58:15.200]  That's how you do that.
[1:58:15.200 --> 1:58:19.400]  And I wrote this forward in a great book by the great Sheriff Joe Arpaio, and it's out
[1:58:19.400 --> 1:58:25.400]  right now, Sheriff Joe Arpaio, an American legend, by the book in his own words, he will
[1:58:25.400 --> 1:58:35.200]  tell you how he would stop arson and looting and savagery by simply demanding law and order.
[1:58:35.200 --> 1:58:40.680]  Back in 60 seconds, 60 seconds, 10 news, and stay with us.
[1:58:40.680 --> 1:58:46.040]  There are many references in the Holy Bible to the mustard seed, and why is that?
[1:58:46.040 --> 1:58:50.640]  It's one of the tiniest seeds out there, but a giant tree like bush grows from it that
[1:58:50.640 --> 1:58:54.160]  produces more mustard seeds.
[1:58:54.160 --> 1:58:58.320]  Mustard was known by the ancients around the world to have amazing health effects.
[1:58:58.320 --> 1:58:59.320]  They didn't know why.
[1:58:59.320 --> 1:59:04.680]  Well, with modern science, we know it's one of the purest, cleanest, organic forms of
[1:59:04.680 --> 1:59:05.960]  selenium.
[1:59:05.960 --> 1:59:14.200]  We have bio-true selenium sold out for months back in stock at infowarsstore.com at 50% off,
[1:59:14.200 --> 1:59:17.720]  store-wide free shipping, and triple-patriot points.
[1:59:17.720 --> 1:59:24.680]  Biotrue selenium at infowarsstore.com is an amazing product, and it's even more amazing
[1:59:24.680 --> 1:59:29.440]  in that it funds our operation, but if you don't know about selenium, research it.
[1:59:29.440 --> 1:59:33.600]  It is an essential nutrient in the body that you've actually have to have.
[1:59:33.600 --> 1:59:38.360]  It's back in stock 50% off, triple-patriot points at infowarsstore.com, and with free
[1:59:38.360 --> 1:59:52.040]  shipping.
[1:59:52.040 --> 1:59:56.280]  We are now four and a half days out from the most historic election in world history, a
[1:59:56.280 --> 2:00:01.360]  referendum for Americanism versus globalism, communism versus freedom.
[2:00:01.360 --> 2:00:07.920]  I'm Alex Jones, this is the Info War, and Ted Nugent is our guest.
[2:00:07.920 --> 2:00:14.640]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of
[2:00:14.640 --> 2:00:15.640]  the Info War.
[2:00:15.640 --> 2:00:21.640]  All right, Ted Nugent's got so many great websites, and Facebook accounts, and Spirit
[2:00:21.640 --> 2:00:27.280]  of the Wild, and Campfire, and everything, just go to TedNugent.com, and you'll find
[2:00:27.280 --> 2:00:28.280]  everything there.
[2:00:28.280 --> 2:00:29.280]  It's amazing.
[2:00:29.280 --> 2:00:33.160]  I personally bought some of the gear, bought some of the ammo in the store, loved it.
[2:00:33.160 --> 2:00:35.960]  Just a great guy, and it's great to support him, and the great work he does across the
[2:00:35.960 --> 2:00:36.960]  country.
[2:00:36.960 --> 2:00:41.040]  Because even Trump has said, in Michigan and other key areas, it was Ted Nugent, did thousands
[2:00:41.040 --> 2:00:45.400]  of events, thousands over the years, building up, getting people registered, and he was
[2:00:45.400 --> 2:00:46.400]  talking about that.
[2:00:46.400 --> 2:00:50.880]  I don't want him to repeat that here in a moment, but for folks that just joined us,
[2:00:50.880 --> 2:00:54.040]  I don't want to have instant gratification civilization.
[2:00:54.040 --> 2:00:58.720]  I see Trump doing five, six rallies a day, being attacked, being lied about, losing over
[2:00:58.720 --> 2:01:05.840]  a billion dollars, as they harass his businesses, all the persecution, and I'm 47, and I can
[2:01:05.840 --> 2:01:09.720]  barely handle the attacks I'm under, and they're not one-tenth the attacks he's under, and
[2:01:09.720 --> 2:01:11.440]  I just have to have admiration.
[2:01:11.440 --> 2:01:16.800]  It's not envy, it's not jealousy, it's admiration, it's such a good trait, that's such a good
[2:01:16.800 --> 2:01:20.880]  feeling to say, man, I really admire him to see what he's done, and you were talking
[2:01:20.880 --> 2:01:21.880]  about that.
[2:01:21.880 --> 2:01:26.080]  This is founding father type stuff, the fact that God gave us President Trump during this
[2:01:26.080 --> 2:01:29.920]  time to challenge these maggots, and the example of him versus them.
[2:01:29.920 --> 2:01:33.760]  Ted, spend a few minutes, because I know this is something we should talk about praising
[2:01:33.760 --> 2:01:35.360]  President Trump as an example.
[2:01:35.360 --> 2:01:40.400]  Well, I've been so honored and humbled to spend time with the great man.
[2:01:40.400 --> 2:01:45.160]  There's something very spiritual about this crazy guy, I mean, I say crazy, he's crazy
[2:01:45.160 --> 2:01:49.000]  like you, he's crazy like me, he's crazy like this welder, I know down the road that no
[2:01:49.000 --> 2:01:53.400]  matter what welding job you have, he shows up early and he welds something that'll never
[2:01:53.400 --> 2:01:58.800]  break and then he goes to his next welding job and he leaves a paper trail of high energy,
[2:01:58.800 --> 2:02:06.840]  of positive spirit, just the energy from this president, you know, like the founding fathers
[2:02:06.840 --> 2:02:13.360]  define the history of slavery and tyranny and kings and emperors and despots, that was
[2:02:13.360 --> 2:02:20.000]  divine intervention, Alex, and I witnessed this great commander-in-chief, Donald J. Trump,
[2:02:20.000 --> 2:02:25.520]  and he goes from rally and rally and he gets up there with piss and vinegar and vim and
[2:02:25.520 --> 2:02:29.880]  vigor, and I'm a high energy guy, I mean, I get on stage and I'll rock your face.
[2:02:29.880 --> 2:02:33.160]  But could you do five shows a day, I mean, it's pretty amazing.
[2:02:33.160 --> 2:02:39.360]  No, I did three concerts back-to-back, three two-hour shows in London, 1979, we kept selling
[2:02:39.360 --> 2:02:42.480]  them out and I wanted to go home the next day, so we did all three in the same day.
[2:02:42.480 --> 2:02:43.480]  Yeah.
[2:02:43.480 --> 2:02:47.520]  And I got to admit, I was much younger back then, but I'll be 72 now and he's got a few
[2:02:47.520 --> 2:02:52.600]  years on me, you should see the sparkle in this man's eye.
[2:02:52.600 --> 2:03:00.960]  Here's the bottom line, the most admirable attribute of a human being is believability.
[2:03:00.960 --> 2:03:07.040]  If you believe this man, you believe he believes in what he says and that he represents your
[2:03:07.040 --> 2:03:11.600]  beliefs, that identifies President Donald J. Trump.
[2:03:11.600 --> 2:03:17.920]  This man just wants to renegotiate global contracts to benefit the United States.
[2:03:17.920 --> 2:03:20.960]  He wants the United States to be the winner.
[2:03:20.960 --> 2:03:24.840]  He wants to have fair deals and he wants to have fair trade.
[2:03:24.840 --> 2:03:31.480]  He wants to benefit the United States of America because this is the last best place.
[2:03:31.480 --> 2:03:38.200]  If we turn it over to the freaks like Pelosi and Biden and Harris, if we turn it over to
[2:03:38.200 --> 2:03:42.280]  them, we are Venezuela overnight.
[2:03:42.280 --> 2:03:45.120]  I totally agree, but let's talk about that magic quality.
[2:03:45.120 --> 2:03:46.120]  It's true.
[2:03:46.120 --> 2:03:49.600]  You've got it more than I do and I've got some charisma because I believe in what I'm
[2:03:49.600 --> 2:03:54.720]  doing, but you've got a lot of charisma on air, even more in person.
[2:03:54.720 --> 2:03:57.720]  Trump, I've met you a few times, I've met Trump.
[2:03:57.720 --> 2:03:59.440]  Trump is wife, it's even more.
[2:03:59.440 --> 2:04:02.440]  It's like, like you said, sparkle in the eye, you can't fake this.
[2:04:02.440 --> 2:04:04.400]  What the hell's this guy got going on?
[2:04:04.400 --> 2:04:10.480]  Well, number one, he believes, he sees the threats to the American dream.
[2:04:10.480 --> 2:04:19.120]  He sees the oath violating by elected employees who have turned the corner into criminality
[2:04:19.120 --> 2:04:25.800]  from Obama to Holder to Lynch to Lois Lerner to Adam Schiff, Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton.
[2:04:25.800 --> 2:04:27.960]  We go right down the list of these gang bangers.
[2:04:27.960 --> 2:04:33.640]  I mean, it's MS-13, Black Lives Matter, Antifa and the Democrat Party.
[2:04:33.640 --> 2:04:39.200]  So he's dialed in an omission against evil and he's jacked right into the power cord.
[2:04:39.200 --> 2:04:45.080]  You know, when I hunt, it's samurai, it's out of body, I think I've become real close
[2:04:45.080 --> 2:04:51.720]  to Bruce Lee when I turned from the loudmouth, high-energy, flame-throwing guitar player
[2:04:51.720 --> 2:04:59.200]  into Cochise, sitting bull, Geronimo, crazy horse with my bow and arrow and I worked the
[2:04:59.200 --> 2:05:02.000]  edge of that swamp, I improvised, adapt and overcome.
[2:05:02.000 --> 2:05:06.080]  I learned that from the US Marine Corps heroes, the Navy Seals and the Army Rangers that
[2:05:06.080 --> 2:05:07.080]  I get to train with.
[2:05:07.080 --> 2:05:09.400]  There's a higher level of awareness.
[2:05:09.400 --> 2:05:16.200]  Trump's got it because he sees the threats to America and he's going to use every maneuver,
[2:05:16.200 --> 2:05:21.720]  every trick, every law he can to stop the Marxist.
[2:05:21.720 --> 2:05:23.720]  It's that critical.
[2:05:23.720 --> 2:05:28.120]  He's saving his family from the wolves.
[2:05:28.120 --> 2:05:29.120]  That's his motivation.
[2:05:29.120 --> 2:05:33.080]  And as he said, they don't hate me, they hate you, they've got to get through me.
[2:05:33.080 --> 2:05:34.080]  He is in the zone.
[2:05:34.080 --> 2:05:38.680]  If there's a zone within the zone, and I've never praised anybody like this, folks, but
[2:05:38.680 --> 2:05:39.920]  we need to thank God for Trump.
[2:05:39.920 --> 2:05:45.840]  We really need to thank our lucky stars and we need to appreciate it because my God, imagine
[2:05:45.840 --> 2:05:50.600]  if we wouldn't have had Trump with these other weak Republicans where we'd be, Ted Nugent.
[2:05:50.600 --> 2:05:59.040]  Hey, Alex, let me, let me expound on the ultimate sucker punch, the counter punch, the double
[2:05:59.040 --> 2:06:04.240]  tap to solar plexus that Donald Trump and we, the people have at our disposal.
[2:06:04.240 --> 2:06:08.800]  I hear Rush Limbaugh, who I have great admiration for, people will call and go, well, what else
[2:06:08.800 --> 2:06:10.320]  can we do but vote?
[2:06:10.320 --> 2:06:12.320]  And Rush was kind of stumbling.
[2:06:12.320 --> 2:06:15.600]  He didn't really know what else you can do but vote, but get other people to vote, get
[2:06:15.600 --> 2:06:16.600]  other people to vote.
[2:06:16.600 --> 2:06:17.600]  No, no, no.
[2:06:17.600 --> 2:06:18.600]  Here's what you do.
[2:06:18.600 --> 2:06:19.600]  You call your mayor.
[2:06:19.600 --> 2:06:21.000]  You call your governor.
[2:06:21.000 --> 2:06:23.920]  You call your congressman and your senator, your alderman.
[2:06:23.920 --> 2:06:29.000]  You call your elected employees every day and go, I support President Trump.
[2:06:29.000 --> 2:06:32.560]  I support law and order.
[2:06:32.560 --> 2:06:34.560]  I support law enforcement.
[2:06:34.560 --> 2:06:36.920]  Ted, I've got to interrupt you because what you said is the key.
[2:06:36.920 --> 2:06:38.520]  I almost started the show with this.
[2:06:38.520 --> 2:06:42.040]  We see college students expelled for saying they support Trump.
[2:06:42.040 --> 2:06:43.520]  We see people fired for it.
[2:06:43.520 --> 2:06:44.520]  They want to intimidate us.
[2:06:44.520 --> 2:06:46.440]  No, we have to wear the colors.
[2:06:46.440 --> 2:06:47.440]  We have to say it loud.
[2:06:47.440 --> 2:06:51.600]  I drive up and down the major roads in Austin almost every weekend in an armored vehicle
[2:06:51.600 --> 2:06:54.480]  because the left of taxes, most people cheer us.
[2:06:54.480 --> 2:06:57.680]  But I, and I just talk about Trump and how we're proud of Trump and proud of America.
[2:06:57.680 --> 2:07:00.960]  We have to exercise that in their damn face.
[2:07:00.960 --> 2:07:02.120]  In their fate.
[2:07:02.120 --> 2:07:07.880]  But again, leave a mark with your elected employees and tell them that you support Donald
[2:07:07.880 --> 2:07:08.880]  Trump.
[2:07:08.880 --> 2:07:14.560]  Drive them batty from we the people's perspective, the people who employ the senator.
[2:07:14.560 --> 2:07:15.640]  We employ the governor.
[2:07:15.640 --> 2:07:17.360]  We employ the mayor.
[2:07:17.360 --> 2:07:19.960]  But we need to tell them what their marching orders are.
[2:07:19.960 --> 2:07:23.040]  And that is that we support the Constitution, the Bill of Rights.
[2:07:23.040 --> 2:07:24.360]  We support the First Amendment.
[2:07:24.360 --> 2:07:29.080]  We want the Google punks to quit censoring us and denying us our First Amendment rights
[2:07:29.080 --> 2:07:31.080]  in the new electronic town square.
[2:07:31.080 --> 2:07:36.560]  But if you don't express that to your elected employees, they don't think you exist.
[2:07:36.560 --> 2:07:38.280]  Well, that's more good news.
[2:07:38.280 --> 2:07:40.320]  Finally, they've sued Google.
[2:07:40.320 --> 2:07:41.320]  Antitrust actions.
[2:07:41.320 --> 2:07:43.000]  They're going after the rest of them.
[2:07:43.000 --> 2:07:45.320]  And now Twitter and others are saying, oh, our employees did it.
[2:07:45.320 --> 2:07:46.320]  It's not us.
[2:07:46.320 --> 2:07:48.600]  So I see that as a good sign right now.
[2:07:48.600 --> 2:07:52.000]  You know, I love what Ted Cruz is doing.
[2:07:52.000 --> 2:07:54.880]  He's putting their feet to the flames.
[2:07:54.880 --> 2:07:56.760]  But you see the response from those people.
[2:07:56.760 --> 2:07:57.880]  Those people are stone.
[2:07:57.880 --> 2:07:59.200]  They're zombies.
[2:07:59.200 --> 2:08:01.240]  They're absolute freaks.
[2:08:01.240 --> 2:08:07.560]  They will crush your First Amendment rights hour after hour and then look starey-eyed
[2:08:07.560 --> 2:08:10.040]  into the camera and go, I'm not censoring.
[2:08:10.040 --> 2:08:14.240]  I'm not suppressing when that's all they do is censor and suppress.
[2:08:14.240 --> 2:08:16.040]  This is a great opportunity.
[2:08:16.040 --> 2:08:22.840]  But again, Alex, if the citizenry does not speak up in a consistent and adamant fashion,
[2:08:22.840 --> 2:08:27.680]  then when our elected employees represent us, it falls on deaf ears because they don't
[2:08:27.680 --> 2:08:28.680]  think they really represent us.
[2:08:28.680 --> 2:08:29.680]  No, you're totally right.
[2:08:29.680 --> 2:08:33.480]  We got to put, we got a lot of fire under their ass demonstrating for their offices.
[2:08:33.480 --> 2:08:34.480]  Call them every day.
[2:08:34.480 --> 2:08:35.480]  Get active.
[2:08:35.480 --> 2:08:36.480]  Every day.
[2:08:36.480 --> 2:08:37.480]  Absolutely.
[2:08:37.480 --> 2:08:38.480]  Drive them nuts.
[2:08:38.480 --> 2:08:39.480]  Ted Nugent.
[2:08:39.480 --> 2:08:40.480]  TedNugent.com.
[2:08:40.480 --> 2:08:44.160]  Ted, I'm on your show the night before the election.
[2:08:44.160 --> 2:08:45.760]  Love to have you pop back in next week.
[2:08:45.760 --> 2:08:48.960]  Say hi to your wonderful wife and the rest of the crew.
[2:08:48.960 --> 2:08:50.800]  Again, people can visit TedNugent.com.
[2:08:50.800 --> 2:08:53.480]  You've got great ways to help people get engaged right there.
[2:08:53.480 --> 2:08:54.880]  We've got 30 seconds left.
[2:08:54.880 --> 2:08:55.880]  Final comment.
[2:08:55.880 --> 2:08:58.240]  Bottom line, I'm having a great hunting season.
[2:08:58.240 --> 2:09:03.880]  Happy hunting season of the hunting family of this country, but everybody go to huntthevote.org.
[2:09:03.880 --> 2:09:09.360]  Huntthevote.org because not only is November 3 important, but every election after that
[2:09:09.360 --> 2:09:13.320]  and we have to be registered and vote God's Family, Country, Law and Order.
[2:09:13.320 --> 2:09:17.280]  My name is Ted Nugent and I give it damn and I vote.
[2:09:17.280 --> 2:09:18.280]  Damn right.
[2:09:18.280 --> 2:09:19.280]  All right, Ted, we love you.
[2:09:19.280 --> 2:09:21.000]  Talk to you soon, my friend.
[2:09:21.000 --> 2:09:22.000]  Live it up, Alistair.
[2:09:22.000 --> 2:09:23.000]  Got speed?
[2:09:23.000 --> 2:09:24.000]  Absolutely.
[2:09:24.000 --> 2:09:27.340]  I tell you, I think of those sleeping giants awakening, but is it enough or is it a day
[2:09:27.340 --> 2:09:28.340]  late, no, it's short.
[2:09:28.340 --> 2:09:31.240]  I don't think it is, but the enemy is going to stage some false flags and more.
[2:09:31.240 --> 2:09:33.840]  We've got special guests coming up on the other side.
[2:09:33.840 --> 2:09:34.840]  You'll want to stay with us.
[2:09:34.840 --> 2:09:38.800]  Carlos Zapata and a special guest stay with us.
[2:09:38.800 --> 2:09:42.760]  I get asked all the time by listeners and by the media, what am I most proud of?
[2:09:42.760 --> 2:09:47.160]  When it comes to the show and it's the fact that Info Wars more than 25 years ago, doing
[2:09:47.160 --> 2:09:52.440]  basic research with what the club of Rome and the CFR and others were actually saying,
[2:09:52.440 --> 2:09:56.680]  developed the hypothesis that the communist China had been set up to take our jobs and
[2:09:56.680 --> 2:10:01.280]  transfer them to China and then make us economically destitute and position us into debt.
[2:10:01.280 --> 2:10:05.440]  Well, now China owns the debt, now China owns Hollywood, all the one side of trading
[2:10:05.440 --> 2:10:06.440]  deals.
[2:10:06.440 --> 2:10:11.040]  It turns out our analysis was absolutely dead on, but again, it wasn't that hard.
[2:10:11.040 --> 2:10:15.960]  The CFR and others admitted what they were doing, but still others didn't want to focus
[2:10:15.960 --> 2:10:16.960]  on that issue.
[2:10:16.960 --> 2:10:17.960]  We did.
[2:10:17.960 --> 2:10:20.760]  And you focused on it by supporting us at Info Wars.
[2:10:20.760 --> 2:10:25.120]  So when you go to infowarstore.com and get all the great supplements, books, t-shirts,
[2:10:25.120 --> 2:10:29.280]  films, water filtration, air filtration, all of it, you're funding the organization that
[2:10:29.280 --> 2:10:31.840]  literally helped make up the world what's really happening.
[2:10:31.840 --> 2:10:33.840]  So that's a big accomplishment for all of you.
[2:10:33.840 --> 2:10:38.840]  I want to thank you for your support.
[2:10:38.840 --> 2:10:43.960]  President 2020 is here and whether Trump wins or loses, we have all won by exposing the
[2:10:43.960 --> 2:10:49.920]  communist Chinese, by exposing the globalist, by exposing the pedophile rings, by exposing
[2:10:49.920 --> 2:10:52.960]  the fact this is really a fight between good versus evil.
[2:10:52.960 --> 2:10:57.040]  Now I'm personally a Christian and I believe in God and I know God's real and I've experienced
[2:10:57.040 --> 2:10:58.040]  it in my life.
[2:10:58.040 --> 2:11:01.760]  But even if you don't believe in God, it's important to recognize that there is good
[2:11:01.760 --> 2:11:03.160]  in this world, there is evil.
[2:11:03.160 --> 2:11:07.760]  And there are people out there that want to do you harm because they enjoy doing that.
[2:11:07.760 --> 2:11:13.160]  And what I see happening across the spectrum, whatever political views, is people finally
[2:11:13.160 --> 2:11:17.760]  get that, they finally understand that they're not being naive anymore.
[2:11:17.760 --> 2:11:23.600]  Don't ever project your decency and your goodness onto other people until they've proven what
[2:11:23.600 --> 2:11:26.880]  they stand for and who they are or you're going to get hurt.
[2:11:26.880 --> 2:11:30.040]  But those of you out there that have done your own research and discovered who's good
[2:11:30.040 --> 2:11:34.120]  and who is faithful will then come together with those organizations and support them
[2:11:34.120 --> 2:11:35.120]  like info wars.
[2:11:35.120 --> 2:11:41.960]  Because without your support, info wars would not exist.
[2:11:41.960 --> 2:11:48.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:11:48.600 --> 2:11:58.920]  Alright, Carlos Zapata a few months ago, welcome back to the Alex Jones show in Shasta, California,
[2:11:58.920 --> 2:11:59.920]  just got upset.
[2:11:59.920 --> 2:12:02.920]  You're declaring war on us, you lock us down but you aren't locked down.
[2:12:02.920 --> 2:12:05.080]  That's siege, we're not going to put up with it.
[2:12:05.080 --> 2:12:10.360]  And now Bill Gates says it's 10 years, Ewan says it's forever and Europe's totally locked
[2:12:10.360 --> 2:12:11.360]  down.
[2:12:11.360 --> 2:12:12.520]  They're down trying to bring it here.
[2:12:12.520 --> 2:12:15.040]  This is war.
[2:12:15.040 --> 2:12:18.520]  Carlos Zapata is joining us, they've written a bunch of national articles demonizing him,
[2:12:18.520 --> 2:12:20.040]  they're really scared of him because he's a leader.
[2:12:20.040 --> 2:12:25.480]  And he wanted to bring on Terry Raposa, who is promoting the state of Jefferson.
[2:12:25.480 --> 2:12:27.720]  So I've been aware of the history for a long time.
[2:12:27.720 --> 2:12:29.560]  He can fill us in on that.
[2:12:29.560 --> 2:12:35.360]  You can find Carlos Zapata at Carlos underscore Zapata underscore one and on Instagram at
[2:12:35.360 --> 2:12:40.840]  Carlos dot Zapata dot 90 and we'll tell you where you can find Terry Raposa, R-A-P-O-Z-A
[2:12:40.840 --> 2:12:41.840]  as info as well.
[2:12:41.840 --> 2:12:46.600]  This is a shorter segment, long segment coming up gentlemen, but thanks for being here and
[2:12:46.600 --> 2:12:50.200]  tell us why you, because I know last time I said I wanted to get Terry on, I'm familiar
[2:12:50.200 --> 2:12:54.880]  with some of his work, but how exciting this is a way to save California in the West Coast
[2:12:54.880 --> 2:12:55.880]  from the Chai comms.
[2:12:55.880 --> 2:12:57.440]  So you guys have got the floor.
[2:12:57.440 --> 2:13:01.720]  Your view on what's currently happening state of Jefferson, the election, where you want
[2:13:01.720 --> 2:13:02.720]  to go.
[2:13:02.720 --> 2:13:03.720]  Thanks for joining us.
[2:13:03.720 --> 2:13:04.720]  Yeah.
[2:13:04.720 --> 2:13:05.720]  Thanks Alex.
[2:13:05.720 --> 2:13:08.800]  Thanks for having me back on and I'm glad Terry's here with me today.
[2:13:08.800 --> 2:13:09.800]  He's got a lot of good information.
[2:13:09.800 --> 2:13:12.600]  I think you'll like a lot of what he says, but we've been busy up here.
[2:13:12.600 --> 2:13:15.520]  You know, when people said, Hey, keep fighting the fight.
[2:13:15.520 --> 2:13:16.960]  We went to work and did just that.
[2:13:16.960 --> 2:13:19.720]  We've been taking the fight to the enemy every single day.
[2:13:19.720 --> 2:13:25.360]  Not only on social media, but also here, you know, in the halls of our own chambers at
[2:13:25.360 --> 2:13:30.840]  our port supervisors meetings in churches, we've been meeting in businesses.
[2:13:30.840 --> 2:13:34.120]  We've been getting together a lot of good patriots and getting ready for this money.
[2:13:34.120 --> 2:13:35.760]  And by the way, they're scared in DC.
[2:13:35.760 --> 2:13:39.760]  They have folks that know big national articles about the rebellion in Northern California
[2:13:39.760 --> 2:13:42.400]  and how you're bad and how no one's following the orders.
[2:13:42.400 --> 2:13:43.400]  Now you're bad.
[2:13:43.400 --> 2:13:44.400]  Right.
[2:13:44.400 --> 2:13:45.400]  Yeah.
[2:13:45.400 --> 2:13:49.320]  You know, somehow we have become that, that pointy tip of the spear in this fight, which
[2:13:49.320 --> 2:13:53.200]  I think last time we talked, Alex last couple of times, you know, I was a little bit reluctant
[2:13:53.200 --> 2:13:57.320]  to, to take that on, but we have taken that on because we built such a fantastic team
[2:13:57.320 --> 2:14:01.440]  up here and whoever knew that Northern California would be an example for the rest of the country
[2:14:01.440 --> 2:14:02.440]  to follow.
[2:14:02.440 --> 2:14:05.960]  But we're getting calls from people all over the country and the world, you know, who are
[2:14:05.960 --> 2:14:09.200]  watching what we're doing and want to support what we're doing and do what we're doing
[2:14:09.200 --> 2:14:10.880]  in their own towns.
[2:14:10.880 --> 2:14:16.040]  So hopefully this is a big movement that we'll talk about that next segment.
[2:14:16.040 --> 2:14:17.040]  Let's get in.
[2:14:17.040 --> 2:14:20.720]  Now your view on the politics, what's unfolding, all the incredible things.
[2:14:20.720 --> 2:14:24.400]  My intel from the highest levels is the Chinese networks are being rolled up.
[2:14:24.400 --> 2:14:25.400]  They're panicking.
[2:14:25.400 --> 2:14:26.800]  They're actually in flight right now.
[2:14:26.800 --> 2:14:29.880]  I'm not saying we're going to win the election for sure, but really good news coming out
[2:14:29.880 --> 2:14:32.920]  that the Democrats are being cut off from their funding.
[2:14:32.920 --> 2:14:36.200]  I think they got caught with their pants down and they don't know what to do.
[2:14:36.200 --> 2:14:38.080]  And people are waking up.
[2:14:38.080 --> 2:14:41.280]  People are absolutely seeing this for what it is for what we've been saying, what we've
[2:14:41.280 --> 2:14:45.960]  been warning them of for the last six months, year, year and a half, you know, now it's
[2:14:45.960 --> 2:14:51.520]  coming to fruition in a very real way and, you know, if you watch the Tucker Carlson
[2:14:51.520 --> 2:14:53.400]  interview the other day, I thought that was fantastic.
[2:14:53.400 --> 2:14:57.840]  I thought that if after that you still believe that you should vote for Biden, then you have
[2:14:57.840 --> 2:15:02.480]  no business having any kind of say into what our country does because you clearly have
[2:15:02.480 --> 2:15:07.160]  lost all your patriotism or any care for anything American.
[2:15:07.160 --> 2:15:08.960]  So what do you think, Terry?
[2:15:08.960 --> 2:15:10.600]  Well, I think a lot of it is local.
[2:15:10.600 --> 2:15:13.480]  I think it's the same way that we fought the revolution.
[2:15:13.480 --> 2:15:17.520]  And I know that you had my good friend, Chris Ham Hall on, not too long ago.
[2:15:17.520 --> 2:15:21.520]  And Chris Ham is actually, I think, the greatest proponent for the Constitution in the United
[2:15:21.520 --> 2:15:24.720]  States maybe in all the world.
[2:15:24.720 --> 2:15:30.120]  Point being is that when you look at what we need to do is we need to have a restoration.
[2:15:30.120 --> 2:15:31.440]  This isn't a revolution, folks.
[2:15:31.440 --> 2:15:32.440]  It's a restoration.
[2:15:32.440 --> 2:15:35.200]  We already have God-given rights, unalienable rights.
[2:15:35.200 --> 2:15:36.200]  We have those rights.
[2:15:36.200 --> 2:15:39.440]  And what we're doing is trying to regain those rights.
[2:15:39.440 --> 2:15:41.200]  They're protected by the Constitution.
[2:15:41.200 --> 2:15:45.240]  And Alex, as you said a hundred times, everybody's pounding on this.
[2:15:45.240 --> 2:15:49.400]  Everybody's trying to pounce on our Constitution and say, well, you know, it's a living document.
[2:15:49.400 --> 2:15:51.080]  It's this, that, or the other.
[2:15:51.080 --> 2:15:54.960]  But I think, and I think this is something Carl Sy would like to express, we really have
[2:15:54.960 --> 2:15:56.560]  found the silver bullet.
[2:15:56.560 --> 2:15:59.000]  And it's a very simple thing.
[2:15:59.000 --> 2:16:05.120]  The silver bullet, basically, is how we get rid of all this crap all at once.
[2:16:05.120 --> 2:16:06.280]  And I think we found that.
[2:16:06.280 --> 2:16:08.640]  And we found it in the people.
[2:16:08.640 --> 2:16:11.520]  And if I may, I could break it down for you.
[2:16:11.520 --> 2:16:12.520]  Yes, start getting into it.
[2:16:12.520 --> 2:16:13.520]  So it's we the people.
[2:16:13.520 --> 2:16:15.440]  That's why it says the Declaration of Independence.
[2:16:15.440 --> 2:16:17.200]  We stop complying, recognize our rights.
[2:16:17.200 --> 2:16:18.200]  It's game over.
[2:16:18.200 --> 2:16:19.200]  Yes, sir.
[2:16:19.200 --> 2:16:20.200]  And that's the whole thing.
[2:16:20.200 --> 2:16:21.200]  So what do we have to do?
[2:16:21.200 --> 2:16:22.200]  We have three things in this silver bullet.
[2:16:22.200 --> 2:16:23.960]  This is, this solves everything.
[2:16:23.960 --> 2:16:26.760]  First of all, without representation, nothing matters, period.
[2:16:26.760 --> 2:16:30.320]  If you're not represented and you don't have your article for section for United States
[2:16:30.320 --> 2:16:35.920]  constitutional position, you are not going to have any kind of say in your government.
[2:16:35.920 --> 2:16:38.120]  Number two, protect the Second Amendment.
[2:16:38.120 --> 2:16:39.160]  Not the Second Amendment.
[2:16:39.160 --> 2:16:40.680]  We can't protect the rest.
[2:16:40.680 --> 2:16:45.440]  We've seen what people like Newsom have done, the mayor of Michigan, et cetera, et cetera.
[2:16:45.440 --> 2:16:51.480]  And number three, when we elect these people, we've got to give them the opportunity to
[2:16:51.480 --> 2:16:53.320]  give them adequate apportionment.
[2:16:53.320 --> 2:16:57.840]  That means that they are able to represent the people who elect them and are accountable
[2:16:57.840 --> 2:17:02.840]  to them and not have a situation like we have in California with the state government where
[2:17:02.840 --> 2:17:09.800]  we have one million people for every state senator and 500,000 for every assemblyman.
[2:17:09.800 --> 2:17:13.440]  We have to have a position to where they're accountable to us, but we also have to give
[2:17:13.440 --> 2:17:17.960]  them a position like maybe one for every 5,000 and a senator for every 10,000 or one for
[2:17:17.960 --> 2:17:21.640]  every county to where people can actually get to their elected officials.
[2:17:21.640 --> 2:17:25.640]  Their elected officials have the opportunity to hear them, and the elected officials must
[2:17:25.640 --> 2:17:33.000]  be accountable to the people and also accountable legally to their oath of office, the United
[2:17:33.000 --> 2:17:39.360]  States Constitution, the state constitution, and also to any laws and not exempt from any
[2:17:39.360 --> 2:17:44.080]  of this qualified immunity, not exempt from anything, but they are in a position where
[2:17:44.080 --> 2:17:46.120]  they are accountable to the same laws we are.
[2:17:46.120 --> 2:17:48.520]  If we do those three things, they're simple.
[2:17:48.520 --> 2:17:53.440]  And Carlos, my friend here, what he represented was every man, a young man who has a business,
[2:17:53.440 --> 2:17:57.960]  a young man who's out there and who's fighting the fight, cares about his family, cares about
[2:17:57.960 --> 2:18:00.400]  his community, cares about his country, fought for his country.
[2:18:00.400 --> 2:18:01.400]  Sure.
[2:18:01.400 --> 2:18:06.120]  And listen, I'm happy to get into federalist systems and all these other systems, and it's
[2:18:06.120 --> 2:18:09.680]  important to rediscover what we are and who we are, the fact that the UN is trying to come
[2:18:09.680 --> 2:18:12.880]  in and say it controls the whole government, the fact that we're under a multinational
[2:18:12.880 --> 2:18:13.880]  system.
[2:18:13.880 --> 2:18:15.920]  We have to rediscover our rights and then enforce them.
[2:18:15.920 --> 2:18:19.400]  But the bigger issue is the state of Jefferson, we're supposed to get a big overview.
[2:18:19.400 --> 2:18:21.840]  How that could start, the history of that, it's fascinating.
[2:18:21.840 --> 2:18:26.200]  I mean, a little bit of time on the state of Jefferson and the move for a long time
[2:18:26.200 --> 2:18:27.200]  to split California.
[2:18:27.200 --> 2:18:29.720]  This was back to the 30s and 40s.
[2:18:29.720 --> 2:18:36.080]  Well, actually, it was, but back in 1941, that movement there, that was about money,
[2:18:36.080 --> 2:18:40.520]  because that was before a court case called Reynolds v. Sims culminated from a number
[2:18:40.520 --> 2:18:44.320]  of court cases in where we did have adequate representation.
[2:18:44.320 --> 2:18:49.720]  The senators at that time were divided up by county, which means that each county had
[2:18:49.720 --> 2:18:55.840]  a senator, and each particular county had an assemblyman based upon population.
[2:18:55.840 --> 2:18:58.640]  Now, that's the same as what we have in the federal government.
[2:18:58.640 --> 2:19:03.520]  As we know, we can have big states like California with 40 million people and a small state like
[2:19:03.520 --> 2:19:08.880]  Wyoming was 700,000, they both have two senators, and the House of Representatives was based
[2:19:08.880 --> 2:19:16.880]  upon the population, and that's where we were prior to 1964, before Reynolds v. Sims.
[2:19:16.880 --> 2:19:23.040]  So in essence, what happens with that is that it works off the federal model of government.
[2:19:23.040 --> 2:19:27.680]  Having those two senators for every state was Madison's idea.
[2:19:27.680 --> 2:19:32.200]  He's saying, you know, hey, we've got to make sure these smaller townships are represented
[2:19:32.200 --> 2:19:36.440]  as well as the larger cities at the time, like New York, Charleston, and Boston.
[2:19:36.440 --> 2:19:46.320]  So two senators as a balance for state and the House of Representatives based on population.
[2:19:46.320 --> 2:19:49.280]  Our assembly was capped in 1862 at 80.
[2:19:49.280 --> 2:19:52.680]  We had 417,000 people.
[2:19:52.680 --> 2:19:55.160]  Our senate was capped at 40.
[2:19:55.160 --> 2:20:02.120]  Since that time, we have gained approximately 40 million people with about one more assemblyman
[2:20:02.120 --> 2:20:04.880]  or one more state senator added.
[2:20:04.880 --> 2:20:10.520]  Now the court system, and I'll leave it with this, the court system at that time had 55
[2:20:10.520 --> 2:20:11.520]  courts.
[2:20:11.520 --> 2:20:13.280]  We now have 2,500 courts.
[2:20:13.280 --> 2:20:19.600]  So I think, as you said before, Alex, and rightly so, the court system's out of control.
[2:20:19.600 --> 2:20:20.600]  It's corrupt.
[2:20:20.600 --> 2:20:26.360]  And it now has a larger position than the other particular branches of government.
[2:20:26.360 --> 2:20:28.360]  All right, gentlemen, fascinating stuff.
[2:20:28.360 --> 2:20:32.160]  Let's get into what's happening in politics, the election, the lockdown, your horrible
[2:20:32.160 --> 2:20:36.200]  evil governor that the Texas governor follows orders from straight ahead.
[2:20:36.200 --> 2:20:37.200]  I want this to sink in.
[2:20:37.200 --> 2:20:42.240]  I want this to sink in real good and to everybody listening, including my own brain.
[2:20:42.240 --> 2:20:46.920]  This lockdown is incredibly sinister and has already starved over 2 million people to death.
[2:20:46.920 --> 2:20:51.560]  It is designed to incrementally be slowly tightened down around our necks.
[2:20:51.560 --> 2:20:55.200]  They are never going to release it.
[2:20:55.200 --> 2:20:59.400]  That's why Trump coming out and saying we cannot, quote, beat the virus by staying locked
[2:20:59.400 --> 2:21:00.400]  up.
[2:21:00.400 --> 2:21:01.400]  We have to get herd immunity.
[2:21:01.400 --> 2:21:06.360]  It's not as deadly as they said it's so important because this is a UN, Bill Gates, globalist
[2:21:06.360 --> 2:21:08.360]  deployed corporate takeover.
[2:21:08.360 --> 2:21:13.160]  So their businesses are all essential, but our businesses aren't.
[2:21:13.160 --> 2:21:16.360]  This is destroying the world economy by design.
[2:21:16.360 --> 2:21:18.000]  This is economic warfare.
[2:21:18.000 --> 2:21:20.040]  This is war crime.
[2:21:20.040 --> 2:21:23.200]  And now they're coming with the attempted forced inoculations that Gates is pushing.
[2:21:23.200 --> 2:21:25.040]  Well, you know what that is.
[2:21:25.040 --> 2:21:30.120]  That violates the Geneva Convention, the Nuremberg Code, and so much more.
[2:21:30.120 --> 2:21:31.360]  Please spread the words.
[2:21:31.360 --> 2:21:36.000]  Please tell folks about Band-Aught Video and the facts that are posted there.
[2:21:36.000 --> 2:21:41.800]  Global wars has been reporting on the dark, unpleasant truths of big government corruption
[2:21:41.800 --> 2:21:43.680]  for over two decades.
[2:21:43.680 --> 2:21:45.840]  It is why they attack us.
[2:21:45.840 --> 2:21:51.080]  And it is why we are now the most banned broadcast in the world.
[2:21:51.080 --> 2:21:56.000]  The Hunter Biden hard drive scandal is merely the tip of the iceberg.
[2:21:56.000 --> 2:22:01.240]  Evil has infested governments everywhere, but the evil establishment is censoring content
[2:22:01.240 --> 2:22:03.920]  across all media platforms.
[2:22:03.920 --> 2:22:07.960]  They blocked you from sharing Band-Aught Video on social media.
[2:22:07.960 --> 2:22:15.480]  So go to electionnight.news and share it like your lives depended on it.
[2:22:15.480 --> 2:22:22.760]  Go to electionnight.news to find the truth about COVID, vaccines, Bill Gates, and Big
[2:22:22.760 --> 2:22:23.760]  Pharma.
[2:22:23.760 --> 2:22:31.160]  Go to electionnight.news to find all the information the crooked establishment is most afraid of.
[2:22:31.160 --> 2:22:35.160]  Go to electionnight.news and share now.
[2:23:01.160 --> 2:23:11.520]  See how the power grab works?
[2:23:11.520 --> 2:23:15.240]  So when you hear them saying Trump is surrendering and his chief of staff is surrendering to
[2:23:15.240 --> 2:23:19.180]  coronavirus, when they say we just have to learn to live with it and boost our immunity
[2:23:19.180 --> 2:23:24.640]  with things like vitamin D, C, and of course, zinc, that's the reality.
[2:23:24.640 --> 2:23:26.040]  That's not fear mongering.
[2:23:26.040 --> 2:23:30.320]  That's not giving in to the power grab and the endless fear of the new world order.
[2:23:30.320 --> 2:23:33.960]  They create a problem to which there is no solution, but they are again the people that
[2:23:33.960 --> 2:23:39.080]  said they're going to be in charge.
[2:23:39.080 --> 2:23:43.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:23:43.080 --> 2:23:59.920]  All right, if you type in Alex Jones or Joe Rogan into a Google search engine news, look
[2:23:59.920 --> 2:24:01.880]  at over a thousand articles the last day.
[2:24:01.880 --> 2:24:04.040]  It's not about bragging.
[2:24:04.040 --> 2:24:06.800]  It's about how scared they are of the truth.
[2:24:06.800 --> 2:24:11.240]  Despite them not letting it trend on YouTube, it has over 7 million views, over 5 million
[2:24:11.240 --> 2:24:15.040]  views on iTunes, and close to that on Spotify.
[2:24:15.040 --> 2:24:21.000]  It's number one biggest ever on Spotify against podcasts have been on Spotify six years.
[2:24:21.000 --> 2:24:24.680]  And it's online to have more than the Elon Musk interview within a week.
[2:24:24.680 --> 2:24:28.120]  My last interview has 25 million views on YouTube alone.
[2:24:28.120 --> 2:24:32.800]  Now folks, that's me with a broken wisdom tooth feeling like crap just covering the truth.
[2:24:32.800 --> 2:24:35.120]  It's not that I'm that good.
[2:24:35.120 --> 2:24:36.800]  People are looking for the truth.
[2:24:36.800 --> 2:24:38.920]  They just know what's straight, just like Carlos Zapata.
[2:24:38.920 --> 2:24:39.920]  Okay.
[2:24:39.920 --> 2:24:42.400]  That's my last speech where everybody agreed with.
[2:24:42.400 --> 2:24:43.400]  We're being enslaved.
[2:24:43.400 --> 2:24:44.400]  We're being pushed around.
[2:24:44.400 --> 2:24:45.760]  Got millions of views online.
[2:24:45.760 --> 2:24:46.760]  They got scared of it.
[2:24:46.760 --> 2:24:50.120]  And so what I'm trying to say is don't ever get scared of the billionaires and all the
[2:24:50.120 --> 2:24:52.680]  power and the system trying to crush you.
[2:24:52.680 --> 2:24:55.440]  People resonate with the truth, but they've got to see leadership.
[2:24:55.440 --> 2:24:59.360]  That's why there's a war on men all over the world because historically and genetically
[2:24:59.360 --> 2:25:03.480]  it's men that lead the fight and speak up and say no to what's happening.
[2:25:03.480 --> 2:25:05.880]  We got to get slapped down up front.
[2:25:05.880 --> 2:25:09.480]  But the good news is Carlos Zapata never gives public speeches.
[2:25:09.480 --> 2:25:14.400]  He's a veteran patriot, millions of millions of views, people love him in California, catalyzing
[2:25:14.400 --> 2:25:15.400]  a national movement.
[2:25:15.400 --> 2:25:17.120]  And it's the same thing for you.
[2:25:17.120 --> 2:25:20.000]  Are you the next Carlos Zapata, the next Alex Jones?
[2:25:20.000 --> 2:25:24.040]  You just simply have to go do the right thing, ladies and gentlemen, and know that that's
[2:25:24.040 --> 2:25:25.040]  what you did.
[2:25:25.040 --> 2:25:29.200]  And maybe it wakes up a thousand people, maybe it wakes up a million people, but it's happening.
[2:25:29.200 --> 2:25:32.680]  Carlos, you've got your guest here, Terry Raposa.
[2:25:32.680 --> 2:25:37.400]  Let's get into the current politics, the world, the globalist strategy, what you expect him
[2:25:37.400 --> 2:25:39.320]  to do with this election.
[2:25:39.320 --> 2:25:43.760]  You're obviously losing early voting shows, huge Republican advantage.
[2:25:43.760 --> 2:25:46.120]  I think they're going to lose big, but they're going to contest it.
[2:25:46.120 --> 2:25:47.120]  They said they are.
[2:25:47.120 --> 2:25:50.640]  What are you guys worried about and what are strategies nationwide?
[2:25:50.640 --> 2:25:51.640]  That is what worries me.
[2:25:51.640 --> 2:25:55.760]  You know, we're sitting here talking about this early on today, Alex.
[2:25:55.760 --> 2:25:58.080]  There's no way that we lose this election legitimately.
[2:25:58.080 --> 2:26:03.320]  I mean, if you look at the numbers, you look at nationwide what's going on, not only, you
[2:26:03.320 --> 2:26:07.760]  know, in the more conservative states, we're talking about even here in California.
[2:26:07.760 --> 2:26:11.480]  I mean, Trump rallies are selling out, there's people waiting for hours and hours and hours
[2:26:11.480 --> 2:26:16.480]  overnight in line to go to these things, you know, there's a 96 mile long Trump parade
[2:26:16.480 --> 2:26:17.480]  in Arizona.
[2:26:17.480 --> 2:26:21.240]  You know, so when they start to tell me that Biden's winning the polls, you got to start
[2:26:21.240 --> 2:26:26.040]  calling bullshit and know that that BS is not going to end when the election votes are
[2:26:26.040 --> 2:26:27.040]  counted.
[2:26:27.040 --> 2:26:28.040]  That's when it's really going to start.
[2:26:28.040 --> 2:26:31.160]  We're going to have a fight for identity of Florida country at that point.
[2:26:31.160 --> 2:26:32.160]  I totally agree.
[2:26:32.160 --> 2:26:35.280]  The real fight starts in five days.
[2:26:35.280 --> 2:26:36.280]  That it really does.
[2:26:36.280 --> 2:26:37.280]  Yeah.
[2:26:37.280 --> 2:26:38.280]  But now this is the easy part.
[2:26:38.280 --> 2:26:39.280]  We're winning.
[2:26:39.280 --> 2:26:40.280]  We've already won this thing, Alex.
[2:26:40.280 --> 2:26:44.120]  The only reason that they could win, the thing that keeps me up at night and makes me scared
[2:26:44.120 --> 2:26:47.880]  and nervous is that there's a thing called fraud, the thing that they are well familiar
[2:26:47.880 --> 2:26:48.880]  with.
[2:26:48.880 --> 2:26:51.400]  And there's one thing that liberal does well is they legislate well.
[2:26:51.400 --> 2:26:57.840]  And when I say legislate, I mean, they litigate well, that they have a very strong team of
[2:26:57.840 --> 2:27:00.280]  attorneys who are able to game this system.
[2:27:00.280 --> 2:27:02.280]  And they have the media back them up with the lies.
[2:27:02.280 --> 2:27:06.520]  They have the media who backs them up, which we don't have, you know, here we are running
[2:27:06.520 --> 2:27:11.600]  into our caves, trying to get people to listen to us, you know, and that they're parading
[2:27:11.600 --> 2:27:15.080]  as if they're the majority, they're certainly not.
[2:27:15.080 --> 2:27:18.040]  That's a great point about the media, you know, and when you look at all this, it's
[2:27:18.040 --> 2:27:23.880]  really going to be taken back locally, state, fed, oh my, and a good example of that is
[2:27:23.880 --> 2:27:24.880]  what Carlos did.
[2:27:24.880 --> 2:27:31.360]  It's kind of like Lions and Tigers and Bears, oh my, Carlos spoke in Chasta County.
[2:27:31.360 --> 2:27:36.640]  He spoke for two minutes, three minutes, when he was done, by the time, time passed
[2:27:36.640 --> 2:27:40.800]  a couple of weeks, what, 25 million people saw that?
[2:27:40.800 --> 2:27:43.400]  Because again, it's the type of thing we have to fight locally.
[2:27:43.400 --> 2:27:47.400]  If we don't start understanding that, that's, that's what we have to do.
[2:27:47.400 --> 2:27:51.320]  We have to do it in our local government, our local boards of supervisors, our local
[2:27:51.320 --> 2:27:52.320]  commissioners.
[2:27:52.320 --> 2:27:58.200]  It's bottom up pressure, it's bottom up pressure, the pressure that we have put on our local
[2:27:58.200 --> 2:28:03.600]  government here, it has won the day, Alex, I mean, we are making progress.
[2:28:03.600 --> 2:28:07.920]  We were supposed to move back into this tyrannical purple tier, we're supposed to close our businesses
[2:28:07.920 --> 2:28:08.920]  here last weekend.
[2:28:08.920 --> 2:28:13.160]  We ended up staying in the red tier, which, listen, I say that's the boss, the entire
[2:28:13.160 --> 2:28:19.280]  tier system, a tyrannical system altogether anyway, but you know, that little victory
[2:28:19.280 --> 2:28:22.880]  that we got to be able to stay in the red tier because the state allowed us to, and
[2:28:22.880 --> 2:28:25.880]  I hate to even say those words, allowed us to, but
[2:28:25.880 --> 2:28:29.240]  But the point is they knew you weren't going to comply, so they didn't want to give you
[2:28:29.240 --> 2:28:30.240]  the victory.
[2:28:30.240 --> 2:28:34.720]  Our local officials went and took the credit, our local officials went out, Leonard Modi
[2:28:34.720 --> 2:28:37.760]  and Mary Rickard, they went out and said, oh, it's all, it's all connections up in Sacramento
[2:28:37.760 --> 2:28:39.320]  that helped us along.
[2:28:39.320 --> 2:28:42.000]  I go connections, so now you have connections, right?
[2:28:42.000 --> 2:28:46.400]  After we put you to the fire, we put your feet to the fire and we put this upward pressure
[2:28:46.400 --> 2:28:47.400]  on you.
[2:28:47.400 --> 2:28:49.520]  Now you want to go and take credit for what we're doing, right?
[2:28:49.520 --> 2:28:51.560]  Well, you know, whatever it takes, I guess, right?
[2:28:51.560 --> 2:28:53.120]  But that's a microcosm.
[2:28:53.120 --> 2:28:57.000]  They want you to see it as a privilege to have your own business open.
[2:28:57.000 --> 2:28:58.280]  These are crazy people.
[2:28:58.280 --> 2:29:03.000]  Can you imagine that, you know, these people have not signed a paycheck in their lives.
[2:29:03.000 --> 2:29:06.160]  You know, they haven't worked an honest day's work in their life, you know.
[2:29:06.160 --> 2:29:10.440]  And Carlos, I agree with you as bad as it is, that's the good news is, they're so disconnected
[2:29:10.440 --> 2:29:12.240]  from reality, that's why they're going to lose.
[2:29:12.240 --> 2:29:15.920]  I mean, don't they know their paycheck comes from your business?
[2:29:15.920 --> 2:29:21.360]  It does, and they claim, and listen to this, our CEO at Shasta County, Matt Pontes, claims
[2:29:21.360 --> 2:29:23.960]  that we lose money from the government, right?
[2:29:23.960 --> 2:29:28.080]  So what he says, he says, we get more money from the state promised to us than we would
[2:29:28.080 --> 2:29:29.080]  if businesses were open.
[2:29:29.080 --> 2:29:32.080]  But I think that's a very short-sighted plan.
[2:29:32.080 --> 2:29:33.080]  Maybe this year, that's the case.
[2:29:33.080 --> 2:29:37.600]  Oh yeah, we're going into debt for generations, exactly.
[2:29:37.600 --> 2:29:43.160]  But long-term, I mean, my kid who runs a lemonade stand knows better, you know, I mean, he's
[2:29:43.160 --> 2:29:47.200]  got more business with than that to know that you can't sustain that for much longer than
[2:29:47.200 --> 2:29:48.200]  this year.
[2:29:48.200 --> 2:29:50.520]  If at all, we can't even afford it this year.
[2:29:50.520 --> 2:29:54.360]  So what happens when they say Trump didn't win, the Democrats said they're going to have
[2:29:54.360 --> 2:29:57.800]  states break, whether they say they're going to have California secede in the New York
[2:29:57.800 --> 2:30:00.080]  Times reported John Podesta war games?
[2:30:00.080 --> 2:30:03.840]  We go back to California again, all politics is local.
[2:30:03.840 --> 2:30:07.520]  What does California do to stand up and say that's not the case when the legislature says
[2:30:07.520 --> 2:30:08.520]  that Trump isn't legitimate?
[2:30:08.520 --> 2:30:13.200]  Well, the thing is, is that if California secedes, that's the best news we ever had,
[2:30:13.200 --> 2:30:19.240]  because we can file for an Article 4, Section 3, a state split, the state of Jefferson,
[2:30:19.240 --> 2:30:23.560]  just like West Virginia did, West Virginia didn't need the state's permission because
[2:30:23.560 --> 2:30:27.400]  there was no state to go to Virginia has seceded from the union.
[2:30:27.400 --> 2:30:30.680]  So in essence, if slow down, that's important, exactly.
[2:30:30.680 --> 2:30:35.360]  Once they say they're not part of the union, it becomes liquefied and you have home rule
[2:30:35.360 --> 2:30:37.520]  under common law and you can split off.
[2:30:37.520 --> 2:30:38.520]  Right.
[2:30:38.520 --> 2:30:42.360]  And that would be paradise for us with Article 4, Section 3, and specifically states the
[2:30:42.360 --> 2:30:48.560]  United States Constitution that a state can be created within a state with the blessing
[2:30:48.560 --> 2:30:54.000]  with a simple one vote of the state legislative body and the Congress of the United States.
[2:30:54.000 --> 2:30:57.040]  The president doesn't have to sign off on it, nor does the governor.
[2:30:57.040 --> 2:31:01.480]  In essence, we would skip the state process, the legislative position in the state and
[2:31:01.480 --> 2:31:06.520]  move directly toward the federal government and say, okay, Congress, we don't want to
[2:31:06.520 --> 2:31:07.520]  leave.
[2:31:07.520 --> 2:31:08.520]  We don't want to take a star off the flag.
[2:31:08.520 --> 2:31:09.520]  We want to add one.
[2:31:09.520 --> 2:31:11.000]  You know, that's the gig.
[2:31:11.000 --> 2:31:15.120]  And before the program's over, I have a two minute little thing I'd like to read on that.
[2:31:15.120 --> 2:31:16.200]  But go ahead, do it right now.
[2:31:16.200 --> 2:31:18.000]  Go ahead and tell us about that, Terry.
[2:31:18.000 --> 2:31:19.000]  All right.
[2:31:19.000 --> 2:31:21.280]  Well, I'll wait because it might take three minutes.
[2:31:21.280 --> 2:31:22.280]  All right.
[2:31:22.280 --> 2:31:23.280]  Keep going.
[2:31:23.280 --> 2:31:24.280]  Big picture here, though.
[2:31:24.280 --> 2:31:26.080]  This is a historic moment, right, guys?
[2:31:26.080 --> 2:31:27.080]  Big picture.
[2:31:27.080 --> 2:31:31.680]  It's got to be a fast track that we've been wanting to do since 1941, Alex, this could
[2:31:31.680 --> 2:31:32.680]  actually fast track.
[2:31:32.680 --> 2:31:34.920]  So if California talks about the seating, that's great.
[2:31:34.920 --> 2:31:38.160]  We win, you know, and we take all the money and resources with us.
[2:31:38.160 --> 2:31:39.600]  So that's what they don't understand.
[2:31:39.600 --> 2:31:43.480]  They think that they're going to succeed from the union and all of a sudden has the same
[2:31:43.480 --> 2:31:48.680]  economic fortitude that they have now, and they will not at all because if you know anything
[2:31:48.680 --> 2:31:52.120]  about the state of California, we hold the resources, we have the water.
[2:31:52.120 --> 2:31:55.680]  And what people don't know is we have a ton of gold up here that is still unmind.
[2:31:55.680 --> 2:31:59.760]  And if they don't succeed, how about we arrest the governor?
[2:31:59.760 --> 2:32:03.560]  We now have a support statement expressing that.
[2:32:03.560 --> 2:32:06.880]  And I, again, I have several different laws the governor's broken.
[2:32:06.880 --> 2:32:10.280]  Everybody's saying, you know, hey, let's, let's, let's sue the guy, let's sue the son
[2:32:10.280 --> 2:32:11.280]  of a bitch.
[2:32:11.280 --> 2:32:12.280]  Okay.
[2:32:12.280 --> 2:32:13.280]  Here's the deal.
[2:32:13.280 --> 2:32:14.280]  Let's sue the son of a bitch.
[2:32:14.280 --> 2:32:15.400]  He's broken the law.
[2:32:15.400 --> 2:32:17.040]  And I think we've been barking up the wrong tree.
[2:32:17.040 --> 2:32:20.520]  I think we have to go after this governor on the way he's broken the law.
[2:32:20.520 --> 2:32:25.760]  Time late code section 1324, the United States code specifically states that you cannot harbor
[2:32:25.760 --> 2:32:27.480]  or shield an illegal alien.
[2:32:27.480 --> 2:32:29.560]  What the hell is a sanctuary state?
[2:32:29.560 --> 2:32:33.560]  Article one, section eight, clause three of the United States Constitution, excuse me,
[2:32:33.560 --> 2:32:38.640]  clause four, specifically states that we as states gave the federal government jurisdiction
[2:32:38.640 --> 2:32:42.400]  over naturalization, over immigration.
[2:32:42.400 --> 2:32:46.080]  You know, he, he is sure he's a rogue governor when he, when he, when he, when he doesn't
[2:32:46.080 --> 2:32:49.040]  follow the federal system, he's no longer a governor.
[2:32:49.040 --> 2:32:50.040]  He's a rogue agent.
[2:32:50.040 --> 2:32:51.040]  He's a pirate.
[2:32:51.040 --> 2:32:52.040]  Yeah.
[2:32:52.040 --> 2:32:53.040]  He's done that.
[2:32:53.040 --> 2:32:54.400]  He's made illegal trade agreements with China.
[2:32:54.400 --> 2:32:59.000]  He's colluded with different states to obviously he's illegal as hell.
[2:32:59.000 --> 2:33:00.640]  What about the good old fashioned recall?
[2:33:00.640 --> 2:33:03.720]  I mean, he's got to be incredibly unpopular that he's got it.
[2:33:03.720 --> 2:33:04.720]  Yeah.
[2:33:04.720 --> 2:33:05.720]  Well, what do we have?
[2:33:05.720 --> 2:33:06.720]  Right.
[2:33:06.720 --> 2:33:07.720]  I think we need 1.4 million votes, right?
[2:33:07.720 --> 2:33:10.720]  And say another 600,000 because of the repeat signatures, right?
[2:33:10.720 --> 2:33:11.720]  The recall.
[2:33:11.720 --> 2:33:13.640]  The recall is a, is a good idea.
[2:33:13.640 --> 2:33:18.280]  The problem with a recall is, is that he has broken the law folks.
[2:33:18.280 --> 2:33:19.280]  He has.
[2:33:19.280 --> 2:33:20.280]  No, I got it.
[2:33:20.280 --> 2:33:21.280]  Okay.
[2:33:21.280 --> 2:33:23.880]  Let's come back and talk about California because that's the big first commie domino
[2:33:23.880 --> 2:33:24.880]  to fall.
[2:33:24.880 --> 2:33:25.880]  And I agree.
[2:33:25.880 --> 2:33:26.880]  We shouldn't just give the state over.
[2:33:26.880 --> 2:33:27.880]  We should take it back.
[2:33:27.880 --> 2:33:34.960]  We'll be right back with Carlos Sopada and his guests.
[2:33:34.960 --> 2:33:40.520]  We're only here on air facing the globalist onsots, the DMC funded lawsuits and everything
[2:33:40.520 --> 2:33:41.700]  that's happening because of you.
[2:33:41.700 --> 2:33:46.600]  We built the only truly multimedia independent radio TV, print, film organization in the
[2:33:46.600 --> 2:33:49.040]  world that promotes the truth against the globalist.
[2:33:49.040 --> 2:33:50.320]  We've had a devastating effect.
[2:33:50.320 --> 2:33:51.680]  We're a national treasure.
[2:33:51.680 --> 2:33:53.840]  You're a national treasure for supporting us.
[2:33:53.840 --> 2:33:57.320]  And so go get a t-shirt, go get a historic t-shirt.
[2:33:57.320 --> 2:33:58.320]  We've got a funny one.
[2:33:58.320 --> 2:34:00.240]  That's the Biden groping a woman.
[2:34:00.240 --> 2:34:01.480]  It's a woman's design shirt.
[2:34:01.480 --> 2:34:02.480]  My wife really likes it.
[2:34:02.480 --> 2:34:03.480]  She sent me this gift.
[2:34:03.480 --> 2:34:04.480]  It's pretty cute.
[2:34:04.480 --> 2:34:05.480]  Here it is.
[2:34:05.480 --> 2:34:06.480]  And it just, you know, it's a little historic thing.
[2:34:06.480 --> 2:34:09.880]  I think Trump's not a win, but if Biden's able to steal it, we'll be probably shut down
[2:34:09.880 --> 2:34:10.880]  pretty quick.
[2:34:10.880 --> 2:34:11.880]  So it'll be historic thing to have.
[2:34:11.880 --> 2:34:15.880]  You'll only be able to fight them in the third dimension on the street with graffiti, with
[2:34:15.880 --> 2:34:20.280]  handbills you hand out and with non-compliance, not paying taxes and pulling your kids out
[2:34:20.280 --> 2:34:25.320]  of the schools and just making it a full-time job to expose and fight and obstruct the criminal
[2:34:25.320 --> 2:34:27.080]  foreign takeover of America.
[2:34:27.080 --> 2:34:28.280]  We've gotten to that point.
[2:34:28.280 --> 2:34:29.280]  Biden's we're nursing home.
[2:34:29.280 --> 2:34:30.440]  I hope to retire Biden.
[2:34:30.440 --> 2:34:31.440]  That'd be a collector's item.
[2:34:31.440 --> 2:34:32.440]  Get it while you still can.
[2:34:32.440 --> 2:34:33.440]  We're not ordering more.
[2:34:33.440 --> 2:34:39.880]  Go to infowarstore.com as I take this announcement, we were exactly 14 days out from the election.
[2:34:39.880 --> 2:34:44.280]  The globalist controlled Democrats know that America has woken up to them and turned against
[2:34:44.280 --> 2:34:45.280]  them.
[2:34:45.280 --> 2:34:47.920]  The whole planet is a huge populist realignment.
[2:34:47.920 --> 2:34:52.880]  And so they've openly said, we need to go to pure authoritarianism, not just censorship
[2:34:52.880 --> 2:34:58.360]  but physically attacking and arresting anyone that doesn't submit to our agenda.
[2:34:58.360 --> 2:35:02.720]  And they're on record saying that once they remove Trump, they are going to persecute
[2:35:02.720 --> 2:35:07.320]  Trump's base and going to try to prosecute us and put us all in prison.
[2:35:07.320 --> 2:35:10.400]  This is what all the old Clintonistas are saying.
[2:35:10.400 --> 2:35:12.680]  It's what the Obama bots are saying.
[2:35:12.680 --> 2:35:14.080]  It's what Keith Overman's saying.
[2:35:14.080 --> 2:35:16.800]  It's what Nancy Pelosi's saying.
[2:35:16.800 --> 2:35:21.000]  This is their stated criminal authoritarian intent.
[2:35:21.000 --> 2:35:24.640]  And they intend to keep the lockdowns going forever and force denoculations.
[2:35:24.640 --> 2:35:29.000]  Trump is trying to end the lockdowns and the same vaccines will be voluntary.
[2:35:29.000 --> 2:35:30.400]  Donald Trump or die.
[2:35:30.400 --> 2:35:32.440]  We've got to get Trump in.
[2:35:32.440 --> 2:35:36.040]  Everybody get out there and vote and tell your family to vote now.
[2:35:36.040 --> 2:35:41.120]  The miraculous properties of turmeric have been admired and even worshiped for thousands
[2:35:41.120 --> 2:35:42.640]  of years by ancient civilizations.
[2:35:42.640 --> 2:35:46.840]  But with modern science, we know why turmeric is so popular.
[2:35:46.840 --> 2:35:48.680]  It's antioxidant effect.
[2:35:48.680 --> 2:35:51.640]  It's anti-inflammatory effect.
[2:35:51.640 --> 2:35:53.840]  Everything it does is simply amazing.
[2:35:53.840 --> 2:35:57.440]  And most turmerics out there are simply food products.
[2:35:57.440 --> 2:36:07.160]  They're 3 to 5% curcuminoid, but we have bodies ultimate turmeric formula with a 95% curcuminoid
[2:36:07.160 --> 2:36:08.160]  level.

[2:36:45.280 --> 2:36:50.280]  It goes together very well with our bodies ultimate turmeric formula that is taken as
[2:36:50.280 --> 2:36:54.640]  a powdered capsule and absorbed in the stomach and intestines.
[2:36:54.640 --> 2:36:58.800]  This is absorbed under the tongue into the bloodstream and then the remaining also is
[2:36:58.800 --> 2:37:00.360]  then absorbed by the stomach.
[2:37:00.360 --> 2:37:02.960]  So it's more of an intense delivery system.

[2:37:13.680 --> 2:37:17.880]  For me, they're both amazing for their anti-inflammatory action and so much more.

[2:37:38.960 --> 2:37:54.080]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:37:54.080 --> 2:37:55.880]  Welcome back Alex Jones here.
[2:37:55.880 --> 2:37:57.720]  Pretty buddy that's read a history book.
[2:37:57.720 --> 2:38:01.320]  You know, there's always groups trying to take you over and sometimes the government
[2:38:01.320 --> 2:38:02.760]  trying to take you over is better than your government.
[2:38:02.760 --> 2:38:03.760]  It's coming around.
[2:38:03.760 --> 2:38:04.760]  Why fight that?
[2:38:04.760 --> 2:38:06.440]  But globalism, communism, the chai comms.
[2:38:06.440 --> 2:38:07.440]  This is not good.
[2:38:07.440 --> 2:38:12.080]  We'd like Venezuela or Nazi Germany or North Korea if this ends up happening.
[2:38:12.080 --> 2:38:13.080]  This is authoritarianism.
[2:38:13.080 --> 2:38:16.640]  Carlos Zapata, activist out in California.
[2:38:16.640 --> 2:38:18.920]  And Terry Repose, another activist, really smart guys.
[2:38:18.920 --> 2:38:22.520]  I heard with us, Terry, you were going to get into a little two, three minute breakdown.
[2:38:22.520 --> 2:38:23.720]  You wanted to cover dealing with this.
[2:38:23.720 --> 2:38:24.720]  Go ahead.
[2:38:24.720 --> 2:38:28.520]  Well, I think the thing is, is what we have to do, I was, it's amazing what you can do
[2:38:28.520 --> 2:38:32.360]  with a couple of buddies sitting in front of a fireplace having beer.
[2:38:32.360 --> 2:38:35.360]  But what we did is we decided to figure out how we're going to do this.
[2:38:35.360 --> 2:38:36.800]  We need a unity is what we need.
[2:38:36.800 --> 2:38:38.240]  We need unity.
[2:38:38.240 --> 2:38:42.840]  And how do we take 23 counties that have signed declarations to withdraw from the state of
[2:38:42.840 --> 2:38:46.400]  California due to lack of representation and dilution of vote?
[2:38:46.400 --> 2:38:47.400]  How do we find that unity?
[2:38:47.400 --> 2:38:50.360]  And how do we find unity for all the counties of California?
[2:38:50.360 --> 2:38:55.640]  So we came up with this young man named Steve Baird and I sat down and we put this together.
[2:38:55.640 --> 2:38:57.440]  So I'm going to read it to you real quick.
[2:38:57.440 --> 2:39:03.280]  11 score and eight years ago, Providence brought together the brightest minds of an age to forge
[2:39:03.280 --> 2:39:09.800]  a lasting legacy, which we in our prosperity are privileged to call our Constitution honoring
[2:39:09.800 --> 2:39:12.960]  a millennia of foundational principles of natural law.
[2:39:12.960 --> 2:39:18.360]  Our founding fathers developed a Republican system of government that is endured more
[2:39:18.360 --> 2:39:20.600]  than two and a quarter centuries.
[2:39:20.600 --> 2:39:25.280]  The Northern California counties of Jefferson as a pledge to Almighty God do declare our
[2:39:25.280 --> 2:39:30.960]  unity with the United States of America and intend with our blood, treasure and sacred
[2:39:30.960 --> 2:39:35.560]  honor to remain with the nation we hold most dear.
[2:39:35.560 --> 2:39:41.800]  No seditious actions by elements within California or its separatist legislature will deter us
[2:39:41.800 --> 2:39:47.760]  from remaining a strong and ardent people living within the greatest nation ever designed.
[2:39:47.760 --> 2:39:53.240]  For how could we as a free people not wish to remain active participants in our representative
[2:39:53.240 --> 2:39:59.880]  form of government, a republic created not to suppress but to serve the people and bind
[2:39:59.880 --> 2:40:05.480]  the government as a nation, our sacred documents codified by the laws of God secure man's
[2:40:05.480 --> 2:40:12.360]  unalienable rights to life, liberty and property and the ability to protect the same.
[2:40:12.360 --> 2:40:18.080]  No man or form of government may ever state claim to those tenants which have been ordained
[2:40:18.080 --> 2:40:21.640]  by him.
[2:40:21.640 --> 2:40:28.920]  Make known that one hint of seditious behavior by a self stylized protectorate of an ignorant
[2:40:28.920 --> 2:40:33.800]  people will be met with swift and unrelenting support of our nation.
[2:40:33.800 --> 2:40:39.160]  The people of the counties bound together under the name of Jefferson are wholly engaged
[2:40:39.160 --> 2:40:48.320]  in remaining one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all.
[2:40:48.320 --> 2:40:53.840]  And that says it all on what we're going to do if they secede from the United States.
[2:40:53.840 --> 2:40:59.080]  And so for listeners, I want people to understand this, and most listeners get this, but some
[2:40:59.080 --> 2:41:00.080]  may not.
[2:41:00.080 --> 2:41:03.680]  China is taking over Hong Kong and Taiwan right now by force.
[2:41:03.680 --> 2:41:07.480]  The globalists by fighting the collapse of Latin America are trying to take us over through
[2:41:07.480 --> 2:41:09.080]  UN action.
[2:41:09.080 --> 2:41:13.620]  And so that's where this is, that there's not movements in California and other states
[2:41:13.620 --> 2:41:17.360]  that when these takeovers are attempted, we have a counter movement, they'll win.
[2:41:17.360 --> 2:41:20.800]  But if there's a counter movement already in place, people will obviously want to stay
[2:41:20.800 --> 2:41:21.960]  in the republic.
[2:41:21.960 --> 2:41:23.880]  This will instantly stop them.
[2:41:23.880 --> 2:41:27.400]  And so what you're doing is God's work, because I know the UN has said they want to break
[2:41:27.400 --> 2:41:29.560]  up the U.S. starting with California.
[2:41:29.560 --> 2:41:33.280]  This is an official plan, and people 10 years ago would laugh at that a year ago.
[2:41:33.280 --> 2:41:34.280]  People don't laugh now.
[2:41:34.280 --> 2:41:35.800]  They see the countries in trouble.
[2:41:35.800 --> 2:41:42.360]  So what you guys are doing is a very good, defensive, forward looking operation, though,
[2:41:42.360 --> 2:41:44.600]  to say no and deny the globalists.
[2:41:44.600 --> 2:41:46.000]  This is very important work.
[2:41:46.000 --> 2:41:49.920]  Well, I think the thing is, is that the cross pollinating with people like the Freedom
[2:41:49.920 --> 2:41:55.440]  Angels, our good friends, JC and Chris Ann Hall, Peggy Hall down in Orange County, there's
[2:41:55.440 --> 2:41:56.440]  so many great people.
[2:41:56.440 --> 2:42:00.560]  Dr. Cordy Williams, a young man who was a Marine, who's now a doctor, great people,
[2:42:00.560 --> 2:42:05.040]  Carlos, you know, and we're finding all these great young people that are understanding,
[2:42:05.040 --> 2:42:09.160]  hey, you know, we need to bond together.
[2:42:09.160 --> 2:42:12.080]  You know, frankly, people say, well, you know, I've lost a lot of my liberty.
[2:42:12.080 --> 2:42:13.640]  No, you've lost all your liberty.
[2:42:13.640 --> 2:42:17.920]  I'd like somebody to name one thing that the government doesn't control at this time,
[2:42:17.920 --> 2:42:22.280]  whether it be the food you eat, the water you use, the gas you use.
[2:42:22.280 --> 2:42:26.000]  We have to all start thinking about taking over our cities, our counties, and if the
[2:42:26.000 --> 2:42:32.040]  UN takes over our state, we have a right to secede because it's not representation, but
[2:42:32.040 --> 2:42:33.600]  it has the taxation.
[2:42:33.600 --> 2:42:37.440]  Carlos Zapata, other points about the election, about Trump, what you're predicting is about
[2:42:37.440 --> 2:42:38.440]  to happen.
[2:42:38.440 --> 2:42:39.440]  Absolutely.
[2:42:39.440 --> 2:42:40.440]  You know, I mean, this is nothing new, right?
[2:42:40.440 --> 2:42:43.520]  This has been done in Vermont, Kentucky, Maine, West Virginia.
[2:42:43.520 --> 2:42:45.440]  I mean, the mechanism is there for us to be able to do this.
[2:42:45.440 --> 2:42:47.480]  But yeah, let's move on to what's going on now, Alex.
[2:42:47.480 --> 2:42:49.560]  I say Trump wins in the last slide.
[2:42:49.560 --> 2:42:53.840]  I say the battle starts when the Democrats contest the election.
[2:42:53.840 --> 2:42:56.760]  And I think that it goes to the Supreme Court, which is great, right?
[2:42:56.760 --> 2:43:01.440]  We have a great new Supreme Court justice there, who I think will see things our way.
[2:43:01.440 --> 2:43:06.200]  But I do not think that the battle will be won in the halls of the Supreme Court or even
[2:43:06.200 --> 2:43:10.200]  the halls of Congress or at the White House, it's going to be on the streets.
[2:43:10.200 --> 2:43:11.200]  That's right.
[2:43:11.200 --> 2:43:14.240]  The communist forces have been wound up and are ready, and sure, they're not formidable
[2:43:14.240 --> 2:43:19.280]  individually, but the stand down of blue city mayors empowers them as a domino effect.
[2:43:19.280 --> 2:43:21.200]  How do you stop that?
[2:43:21.200 --> 2:43:24.600]  Employ the insurrection acts sent in federal troops to commandeer those cities that are
[2:43:24.600 --> 2:43:27.200]  no longer under state control?
[2:43:27.200 --> 2:43:33.040]  You know, the number one weapon that the left has historically, Alex, is destabilization,
[2:43:33.040 --> 2:43:34.040]  destabilization.
[2:43:34.040 --> 2:43:38.160]  They will destabilize our, our, our societies, they'll destabilize our businesses, which
[2:43:38.160 --> 2:43:42.440]  they've already done with this whole COVID hoax, and, and they will continue to do this,
[2:43:42.440 --> 2:43:46.840]  you know, uh, from our schools to, to where we shop to where we live.
[2:43:46.840 --> 2:43:51.240]  So if we think for one second that we don't have a fight ahead of us, you are dead wrong.
[2:43:51.240 --> 2:43:52.640]  We're prepared here, Alex.
[2:43:52.640 --> 2:43:53.640]  We have people we can call.
[2:43:53.640 --> 2:43:57.800]  We have people who we're training, who, uh, I mean, we have food supplies.
[2:43:57.800 --> 2:43:58.800]  We have water.
[2:43:58.800 --> 2:44:02.760]  We have everything we need to survive and to fight a war against these idiots, because
[2:44:02.760 --> 2:44:06.240]  they think they're going to come over here and tell us what to do after we won a legitimate
[2:44:06.240 --> 2:44:08.440]  election and they want to illegitimize that.
[2:44:08.440 --> 2:44:11.440]  Uh, they have to be clear when you say you have food and water, they're trying to cut
[2:44:11.440 --> 2:44:16.600]  that off with COVID as the cover for a siege, an international UN run siege.
[2:44:16.600 --> 2:44:19.740]  They admit to make us hate Trump, but it's backfired.
[2:44:19.740 --> 2:44:22.240]  People know that Trump and the Republicans didn't do this.
[2:44:22.240 --> 2:44:23.240]  What are folks saying?
[2:44:23.240 --> 2:44:27.840]  Cause I've read the national news stories, uh, in, in very fair and political and a bunch
[2:44:27.840 --> 2:44:31.880]  of places really demonizing Northern California for how radical it is.
[2:44:31.880 --> 2:44:33.280]  But I know a lot of liberals that used to live there.
[2:44:33.280 --> 2:44:34.280]  I know a psychologist.
[2:44:34.280 --> 2:44:35.280]  I know a psychiatrist.
[2:44:35.280 --> 2:44:37.440]  I know a medical doctor.
[2:44:37.440 --> 2:44:39.040]  I know a lawyer that lives there.
[2:44:39.040 --> 2:44:40.240]  They're all super listers now.
[2:44:40.240 --> 2:44:41.440]  They weren't listers years ago.
[2:44:41.440 --> 2:44:42.920]  I knew them through family.
[2:44:42.920 --> 2:44:44.680]  They're all more rabid than I am now.
[2:44:44.680 --> 2:44:50.440]  I mean, I really think they've triggered an awakening here of vestigial energies and,
[2:44:50.440 --> 2:44:52.640]  and, and, and instincts people had.
[2:44:52.640 --> 2:44:56.520]  Well, it's all theoretical when you're sitting in a college classroom getting brainwashed,
[2:44:56.520 --> 2:45:00.480]  but once you go out out into the real world and you see it wraps you under attack, you
[2:45:00.480 --> 2:45:01.480]  have a choice to make.
[2:45:01.480 --> 2:45:04.680]  And I think that's what's happened now, Alex, is our backs to the wall.
[2:45:04.680 --> 2:45:09.720]  We've been attacked in a very real way to where if we don't fight back, we will not
[2:45:09.720 --> 2:45:10.720]  survive.
[2:45:10.720 --> 2:45:14.440]  We will be wards of the state for the rest of our lives.
[2:45:14.440 --> 2:45:18.440]  We will be enslaved to people such as Gavin Newsom for the rest of our lives.
[2:45:18.440 --> 2:45:22.360]  So, so we're fighting at this point and people are behind us and you're right.
[2:45:22.360 --> 2:45:26.800]  I have left his friends who have left the Democratic Party now and have joined.
[2:45:26.800 --> 2:45:30.840]  And this is not about Republican or Democrats or evil on both sides.
[2:45:30.840 --> 2:45:31.840]  This is about liberty.
[2:45:31.840 --> 2:45:32.840]  It's about human sovereignty.
[2:45:32.840 --> 2:45:34.840]  That's what it is.
[2:45:34.840 --> 2:45:36.400]  It's absolutely about sovereignty.
[2:45:36.400 --> 2:45:37.400]  It's about freedom.
[2:45:37.400 --> 2:45:40.080]  It sounds so cliche, but that's what we're fighting for every single day, Alex.
[2:45:40.080 --> 2:45:42.240]  I think that's why it's a unifying message.
[2:45:42.240 --> 2:45:44.920]  This is not a separatist message like they would have you believe.
[2:45:44.920 --> 2:45:45.920]  This is actually a...
[2:45:45.920 --> 2:45:46.920]  No, no.
[2:45:46.920 --> 2:45:47.920]  The globalists want to break the country up.
[2:45:47.920 --> 2:45:48.920]  You want to unify it.
[2:45:48.920 --> 2:45:49.920]  Yeah.
[2:45:49.920 --> 2:45:50.920]  We're galvanized, you know?
[2:45:50.920 --> 2:45:51.920]  I mean, this is great.
[2:45:51.920 --> 2:45:52.920]  We're stronger than ever.
[2:45:52.920 --> 2:45:56.200]  You come up here to Haman County, Shasta County, Siski County, and he's Northern, Northern
[2:45:56.200 --> 2:45:59.840]  counties in Northern California, and you're not going to overrun us.
[2:45:59.840 --> 2:46:01.760]  There's pioneer blood that runs through our veins.
[2:46:01.760 --> 2:46:02.760]  Because I've read it.
[2:46:02.760 --> 2:46:06.000]  Even the news is pissed that no one's wearing the damn mask anymore.
[2:46:06.000 --> 2:46:08.200]  Almost all the businesses are open to saying, screw you.
[2:46:08.200 --> 2:46:09.200]  Why would we?
[2:46:09.200 --> 2:46:10.200]  Well, why would I?
[2:46:10.200 --> 2:46:13.440]  The only thing a mask does is tell them who they can control.
[2:46:13.440 --> 2:46:16.200]  There's less people wearing masks now, Alex.
[2:46:16.200 --> 2:46:17.480]  Up here, I'm seeing less and less.
[2:46:17.480 --> 2:46:21.640]  For a while, I saw a little spike where people were wearing them everywhere, and now I think
[2:46:21.640 --> 2:46:23.600]  people are starting to realize it.
[2:46:23.600 --> 2:46:26.400]  And if they are wearing a mask, you can see the embarrassment in their eyes when they
[2:46:26.400 --> 2:46:29.720]  see people like me, and you can see the cowardice, and you can see...
[2:46:29.720 --> 2:46:30.720]  I agree.
[2:46:30.720 --> 2:46:31.720]  We're out of time.
[2:46:31.720 --> 2:46:32.720]  Carlos, a pod of Terry, repose.
[2:46:32.720 --> 2:46:33.720]  Great to have you on.
[2:46:33.720 --> 2:46:34.720]  Thank you so much, gentlemen.
[2:46:34.720 --> 2:46:35.720]  Thank you.
[2:46:35.720 --> 2:46:36.720]  All right.
[2:46:36.720 --> 2:46:41.920]  Now, we got Matt Bracken coming up, but I promised callers, Jim, Thomas, Wendy, Matt,
[2:46:41.920 --> 2:46:44.200]  Mark, Emanuel, Brian, and Stephen.
[2:46:44.200 --> 2:46:45.200]  So you've been holding the longest.
[2:46:45.200 --> 2:46:49.200]  Whoever's been holding the longest, I'm going to go right to you, Stephen, in Florida.
[2:46:49.200 --> 2:46:50.360]  We start to next hour.
[2:46:50.360 --> 2:46:51.360]  Great guest.
[2:46:51.360 --> 2:46:55.560]  Great to have the local view versus the international and national view separately.
[2:46:55.560 --> 2:46:59.320]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[2:46:59.320 --> 2:47:02.240]  And even though we're turning the corner in a lot of ways, M4s is not turning the corner.
[2:47:02.240 --> 2:47:03.240]  We need financial support.
[2:47:03.240 --> 2:47:08.900]  Plus, I'm selling things you need, books, films, documentaries, air filtration, water
[2:47:08.900 --> 2:47:10.160]  filtration, storeable food.
[2:47:10.160 --> 2:47:12.520]  It's all the best you're going to find at the lowest price.
[2:47:12.520 --> 2:47:15.400]  And by that, there's always something better that costs five times more of it.
[2:47:15.400 --> 2:47:18.920]  For good price stuff that's high quality, we got it.
[2:47:18.920 --> 2:47:20.680]  It's all there.
[2:47:20.680 --> 2:47:22.280]  We have two new items.
[2:47:22.280 --> 2:47:23.280]  Back in stock.
[2:47:23.280 --> 2:47:25.480]  This will be next week's sale, but I'm launching it now.
[2:47:25.480 --> 2:47:29.880]  We have bio tricillinium that's essential for electrochemical activity, the body, immunity,
[2:47:29.880 --> 2:47:30.880]  everything.
[2:47:30.880 --> 2:47:37.280]  Back in stock, 50% off, M4store.com, triple page, three points reshipping, and bodies.
[2:47:37.280 --> 2:47:42.440]  Ultimate turmeric formula, 95% humanoid, other than competitors have a three to 5%.
[2:47:42.440 --> 2:47:44.440]  This is amazingly strong.
[2:47:44.440 --> 2:47:45.440]  People are blown away.
[2:47:45.440 --> 2:47:47.960]  My wife got some great benefits for her joints and stuff.
[2:47:47.960 --> 2:47:50.720]  She plays a lot of competitive sports with normal turmeric.
[2:47:50.720 --> 2:47:52.720]  She's like, my God, this is way better.
[2:47:52.720 --> 2:47:53.720]  Why?
[2:47:53.720 --> 2:47:54.720]  I said, it's concentrate, sweetheart.
[2:47:54.720 --> 2:47:57.280]  So now she's addicted to it for two years.
[2:47:57.280 --> 2:48:01.520]  She's ultimate turmeric formula, back in stock, 50% off, triple page, three points, free
[2:48:01.520 --> 2:48:06.680]  shipping, M4store.com, ultra 12, great for immune system, high quality B12 under the
[2:48:06.680 --> 2:48:11.720]  tongue, 50% off, vitamin refusion discounted, but it's going to sell out.
[2:48:11.720 --> 2:48:16.240]  Take advantage of these sales right now while you still can and fund the M4.
[2:48:16.240 --> 2:48:20.720]  And of course, get an arrest Bill Gates and Fauci shirt, M4store.com as well.
[2:48:20.720 --> 2:48:25.200]  Back in two minutes and right to your calls.
[2:48:25.200 --> 2:48:28.560]  Degenerative dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[2:48:28.560 --> 2:48:32.920]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[2:48:32.920 --> 2:48:37.600]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them
[2:48:37.600 --> 2:48:42.120]  a bottle of ultimate fish oil from infowarsstore.com.
[2:48:42.120 --> 2:48:46.920]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower
[2:48:46.920 --> 2:48:52.660]  blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque and provide
[2:48:52.660 --> 2:48:58.640]  a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[2:48:58.640 --> 2:49:05.280]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function
[2:49:05.280 --> 2:49:09.880]  by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[2:49:09.880 --> 2:49:15.640]  It worked for my family and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual
[2:49:15.640 --> 2:49:18.480]  facts that pertain to reality.
[2:49:18.480 --> 2:49:26.160]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member or yourself at infowarsstore.com.
[2:49:26.160 --> 2:49:32.160]  I once saw a bumper sticker that read, if you want your children to listen to you, whisper
[2:49:32.160 --> 2:49:33.160]  and it's true.
[2:49:33.160 --> 2:49:38.000]  A lot of times if somebody's shouting and yelling, even if what they're talking about
[2:49:38.000 --> 2:49:40.680]  is important, people tend to tune it out.
[2:49:40.680 --> 2:49:41.680]  You know why I know that?
[2:49:41.680 --> 2:49:47.240]  Because I'm Alex Jones and I've been pretty obnoxious over the years because I'm worried
[2:49:47.240 --> 2:49:52.120]  about the New World Order and I read about all their plans to lock down civilization,
[2:49:52.120 --> 2:49:55.680]  start the third world and then enslave the first world.
[2:49:55.680 --> 2:49:59.880]  So I've been really, really loud and really, really aggressive and we've had a big effect
[2:49:59.880 --> 2:50:05.240]  but now it's time to think about every different angle and every different way we can get
[2:50:05.240 --> 2:50:08.920]  people to think for themselves before it's too late.
[2:50:08.920 --> 2:50:14.480]  The lockdown, the social distancing, the mask is meant to end human civilization.
[2:50:14.480 --> 2:50:20.240]  We are under a civilization collapse weapon so this is live and death.
[2:50:20.240 --> 2:50:29.080]  Please share at infowars.com and band our video and watch our live election coverage.
[2:50:29.080 --> 2:50:45.280]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:50:45.280 --> 2:50:46.280]  We are back live, folks.
[2:50:46.280 --> 2:50:47.280]  Big stuff's going down.
[2:50:47.280 --> 2:50:54.360]  When I laid out some positive news for the first hour, we're on the march sleeping.
[2:50:54.360 --> 2:50:56.360]  It's unbelievable what's going down.
[2:50:56.360 --> 2:51:01.360]  You know, I don't give you positive news unless that's the case.
[2:51:01.360 --> 2:51:05.480]  All right, let's go to some phone calls.
[2:51:05.480 --> 2:51:07.480]  Appreciate folks holding so patiently.
[2:51:07.480 --> 2:51:11.280]  Brian, I know Steve's, no, no, no, Brian's first and Steve.
[2:51:11.280 --> 2:51:13.280]  Brian in Washington, thanks for holding.
[2:51:13.280 --> 2:51:14.280]  You're on the air.
[2:51:14.280 --> 2:51:15.280]  Hey, how's it going?
[2:51:15.280 --> 2:51:16.280]  That was a quick phone call.
[2:51:16.280 --> 2:51:17.280]  I'm fired.
[2:51:17.280 --> 2:51:18.280]  I'm talking to you, brother.
[2:51:18.280 --> 2:51:19.280]  Thanks for holding.
[2:51:19.280 --> 2:51:20.280]  Go ahead.
[2:51:20.280 --> 2:51:21.280]  Hey, really appreciate it.
[2:51:21.280 --> 2:51:26.560]  It's helped me appreciate my life on biologists for eight years.
[2:51:26.560 --> 2:51:32.600]  I wanted to get a few subjects such as Trump and why he gave power to the governor to march.
[2:51:32.600 --> 2:51:35.760]  What's the best way to get these people out of office?
[2:51:35.760 --> 2:51:39.800]  Give them power to do what they want and let them do what they want and expose themselves
[2:51:39.800 --> 2:51:43.760]  to the pirates that wake the people up and they get out when they vote.
[2:51:43.760 --> 2:51:48.880]  So I believe this is a step ahead strategy to allow them to expose themselves and so
[2:51:48.880 --> 2:51:53.280]  that we can see the enemy and so that we, the people, can target the enemy and get them
[2:51:53.280 --> 2:51:54.400]  out of office.
[2:51:54.400 --> 2:51:57.320]  I want to know what you thought about that.
[2:51:57.320 --> 2:52:01.320]  That's what Trump does 30% of the time.
[2:52:01.320 --> 2:52:02.920]  I mean, I have to dead, dead reckon it.
[2:52:02.920 --> 2:52:03.920]  That's not an exact statement.
[2:52:03.920 --> 2:52:05.440]  It's dead reckoning.
[2:52:05.440 --> 2:52:11.440]  Trump on guns or Trump on COVID will let them do what they want just to expose what they're
[2:52:11.440 --> 2:52:12.440]  doing.
[2:52:12.440 --> 2:52:13.440]  And I don't do that.
[2:52:13.440 --> 2:52:16.240]  I mean, Trump's smarter than I am, obviously, in many ways.
[2:52:16.240 --> 2:52:18.960]  So I'm not going to, I'm not going to say he's bad.
[2:52:18.960 --> 2:52:20.440]  I'm going to say I wouldn't do it that way.
[2:52:20.440 --> 2:52:22.120]  I would just frontal attack.
[2:52:22.120 --> 2:52:23.120]  But that's what I do.
[2:52:23.120 --> 2:52:24.920]  It's kind of like, you know, bam, bam, bam.
[2:52:24.920 --> 2:52:28.360]  And Trump does a lot of frontal attacks too, but he does do that.
[2:52:28.360 --> 2:52:33.320]  My problem is you let tyrants get into office, then they engage in tyranny and get rid of
[2:52:33.320 --> 2:52:38.560]  the real voting and then you can never get rid of them versus violence without violence.
[2:52:38.560 --> 2:52:42.920]  And so the idea of that, I think we have enough examples of what the globalists on the left
[2:52:42.920 --> 2:52:49.280]  do than giving them another chance to wreck everything, but Trump has done that like letting
[2:52:49.280 --> 2:52:50.280]  the riots happen.
[2:52:50.280 --> 2:52:55.000]  Because that was an adjupropt, an adjupropt is a Soviet term that they just codified a
[2:52:55.000 --> 2:53:00.760]  program that was already well known in every society of have a group go out, stir up problems,
[2:53:00.760 --> 2:53:05.080]  have the cops over respond, and then say there's been a big police state crackdown.
[2:53:05.080 --> 2:53:10.280]  And so they tried an adjupropt on Trump and the police and the police didn't respond.
[2:53:10.280 --> 2:53:14.880]  But see, you cannot respond to the adjupropt, then when the real riot hits, they bring down
[2:53:14.880 --> 2:53:20.760]  the whole government, the whole system, and then they take over because it kills confidence
[2:53:20.760 --> 2:53:21.760]  in the system.
[2:53:21.760 --> 2:53:24.000]  So it's a very dangerous game.
[2:53:24.000 --> 2:53:30.080]  And you know, just because people are provocaturing something doesn't mean you don't arrest them.
[2:53:30.080 --> 2:53:32.600]  So I probably would have not done what Trump did.
[2:53:32.600 --> 2:53:35.560]  I probably would have sent folks in to stop these riots.
[2:53:35.560 --> 2:53:39.040]  You could say though, well, it made people wake up and it made people wake up to how
[2:53:39.040 --> 2:53:41.400]  bad Soros is, okay, still, I get it.
[2:53:41.400 --> 2:53:42.960]  I don't do that.
[2:53:42.960 --> 2:53:43.960]  I'm not the president.
[2:53:43.960 --> 2:53:46.920]  Maybe that's why I'm not going to be the president.
[2:53:46.920 --> 2:53:48.400]  But that's what Trump did.
[2:53:48.400 --> 2:53:53.240]  So is that good or evil that Trump let the riots go on because the state stood down?
[2:53:53.240 --> 2:53:56.880]  That's their jurisdiction, because he knew they were going to set him up when he did
[2:53:56.880 --> 2:53:57.880]  that.
[2:53:57.880 --> 2:54:01.480]  I mean, it is kind of the folks' fault in those cities that elected these people.
[2:54:01.480 --> 2:54:02.640]  So again, I'm not attacking Trump.
[2:54:02.640 --> 2:54:05.240]  I kind of see why he's right.
[2:54:05.240 --> 2:54:06.400]  But is there a third rail?
[2:54:06.400 --> 2:54:11.480]  Is there a way to do it that's not go in and cause a big problem, but also not let it happen?
[2:54:11.480 --> 2:54:12.960]  I think you arrest the leaders.
[2:54:12.960 --> 2:54:18.760]  The answer is the Justice Department does its job when racketeering powerful leadership,
[2:54:18.760 --> 2:54:21.920]  when billionaires are funding criminal activity, you arrest them.
[2:54:21.920 --> 2:54:25.560]  You don't go crack heads of meth heads and give them the war on the streets they want.
[2:54:25.560 --> 2:54:26.560]  You arrest the leadership.
[2:54:26.560 --> 2:54:27.880]  I think I just answered the question.
[2:54:27.880 --> 2:54:28.880]  What do you think?
[2:54:28.880 --> 2:54:29.880]  Yeah, much agreed.
[2:54:29.880 --> 2:54:35.360]  I should step ahead of it, ahead of time, shut it down right away.
[2:54:35.360 --> 2:54:39.520]  And that Robert guy, he said he was a man of Christ and stuff, but he's got so much
[2:54:39.520 --> 2:54:40.520]  room to do him.
[2:54:40.520 --> 2:54:44.960]  People need to remember that we are bringing the kingdom of God in Earth as it is in heaven.
[2:54:44.960 --> 2:54:45.960]  We win.
[2:54:45.960 --> 2:54:49.920]  We need more righteous men to stand up and speak out and stop staring.
[2:54:49.920 --> 2:54:55.280]  These globalists, Marxists, communists, thugs that are trying to plunk us and to lose on
[2:54:55.280 --> 2:54:56.280]  our freedoms.
[2:54:56.280 --> 2:55:00.480]  And if we all just put our foot down and spoke out, it would end just like others.
[2:55:00.480 --> 2:55:01.480]  No, I agree with you.
[2:55:01.480 --> 2:55:02.480]  God bless you.
[2:55:02.480 --> 2:55:03.480]  We're out of time.
[2:55:03.480 --> 2:55:04.480]  Thank you so much.
[2:55:04.480 --> 2:55:08.120]  I want to judge other Christians because that turns to another denomination.
[2:55:08.120 --> 2:55:09.720]  That's all they do all day.
[2:55:09.720 --> 2:55:14.800]  But you know, Christ wasn't there telling people how to keep their toenails trimmed perfectly.
[2:55:14.800 --> 2:55:17.680]  He was saying the Pharisees tell you how you're evil all day, but they don't stand up against
[2:55:17.680 --> 2:55:18.680]  the main corruption.
[2:55:18.680 --> 2:55:20.400]  I'm going to fight the main corruption.
[2:55:20.400 --> 2:55:21.840]  I've got a relationship with God.
[2:55:21.840 --> 2:55:25.160]  It doesn't mean I'm perfect, doesn't mean I don't have a conscience, but I don't need
[2:55:25.160 --> 2:55:29.160]  other men telling me how I'm bad all day so they can be above me.
[2:55:29.160 --> 2:55:34.280]  No, that's Satanism.
[2:55:34.280 --> 2:55:38.440]  There are many references in the Holy Bible to the mustard seed.
[2:55:38.440 --> 2:55:39.440]  And why is that?
[2:55:39.440 --> 2:55:44.240]  It's one of the tiniest seeds out there, but a giant tree like bush grows from it that
[2:55:44.240 --> 2:55:47.760]  produces more mustard seeds.
[2:55:47.760 --> 2:55:51.880]  Mustard was known by the ancients around the world to have amazing health effects.
[2:55:51.880 --> 2:55:52.880]  They didn't know why.
[2:55:52.880 --> 2:55:58.060]  Well, with modern science, we know it's one of the purest, cleanest, organic forms of
[2:55:58.060 --> 2:55:59.560]  selenium.
[2:55:59.560 --> 2:56:07.800]  We have bio-true selenium sold out for months back in stock at infowarsstore.com at 50% off,
[2:56:07.800 --> 2:56:11.280]  store-rived free shipping, and triple-patriot points.
[2:56:11.280 --> 2:56:18.280]  Bio-true selenium at infowarsstore.com is an amazing product, and it's even more amazing
[2:56:18.280 --> 2:56:19.880]  in that it funds our operation.
[2:56:19.880 --> 2:56:23.040]  But if you don't know about selenium, research it.
[2:56:23.040 --> 2:56:27.200]  It is an essential nutrient in the body that you actually have to have.
[2:56:27.200 --> 2:56:31.960]  It's back in stock at 50% off, triple-patriot points, and infowarsstore.com, and with free
[2:56:31.960 --> 2:56:33.460]  shipping.
[2:56:33.460 --> 2:56:41.280]  The only one that can judge me is the Tim of the Spear.
[2:56:41.280 --> 2:56:44.120]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[2:56:44.120 --> 2:56:47.520]  Only God can judge.
[2:56:47.520 --> 2:56:48.520]  Final judgment.
[2:56:48.520 --> 2:56:51.840]  All right, let's race through your phone calls here, folks holding.
[2:56:51.840 --> 2:56:54.520]  Let's talk to Stephen in Florida, Stephen.
[2:56:54.520 --> 2:56:55.520]  Thanks for holding.
[2:56:55.520 --> 2:56:57.880]  Yeah, thank you, Alex.
[2:56:57.880 --> 2:57:02.360]  Okay, here's my take on the election situation.
[2:57:02.360 --> 2:57:07.360]  And first of all, I want to say to everyone out there, please support infowars by buying
[2:57:07.360 --> 2:57:09.360]  the great products Alex has.
[2:57:09.360 --> 2:57:14.160]  Alex, you are the mocking-jay of this movement, and everyone that's seen the Hunger Games
[2:57:14.160 --> 2:57:15.600]  knows exactly what I'm saying.
[2:57:15.600 --> 2:57:17.400]  That's why you've been attacked so much.
[2:57:17.400 --> 2:57:21.720]  You've been shooting your fiery arrows of truth at Capitol City at the heart of the
[2:57:21.720 --> 2:57:24.960]  beast for years, and you've been proven right.
[2:57:24.960 --> 2:57:29.480]  So I just want to tell everyone, support what you're doing, because your products are the
[2:57:29.480 --> 2:57:30.480]  real deal.
[2:57:30.480 --> 2:57:34.280]  Well, let me just say this, because I sit up here, and I can't stand listening to myself,
[2:57:34.280 --> 2:57:35.280]  and I try to do a good job.
[2:57:35.280 --> 2:57:40.120]  I tell the truth, but I'm obnoxious because I'm exhausted, but we literally are seen by
[2:57:40.120 --> 2:57:41.720]  the enemy as the Tim of the Spear.
[2:57:41.720 --> 2:57:43.600]  We are seen as the mocking-jay.
[2:57:43.600 --> 2:57:49.000]  We are seen as the populace they fear, and so they want our head, and a lot of listeners
[2:57:49.000 --> 2:57:52.080]  get that support of this, but I'm just saying, we're a signet.
[2:57:52.080 --> 2:57:55.640]  They're like a standard, a Roman standard the enemy wants to capture.
[2:57:55.640 --> 2:57:56.640]  They really do.
[2:57:56.640 --> 2:57:57.640]  Yes, sir.
[2:57:57.640 --> 2:58:01.040]  Now, here's what I want to say about this situation.
[2:58:01.040 --> 2:58:05.280]  I want to modify a statement I made about a month ago on your show.
[2:58:05.280 --> 2:58:10.360]  Remember, if you remember, I said, I did not think we were going to even have an election,
[2:58:10.360 --> 2:58:15.200]  and your crew had actually put up a graphics to go along with my call that you played over
[2:58:15.200 --> 2:58:16.200]  and over.
[2:58:16.200 --> 2:58:17.840]  Well, here's what I want to say.
[2:58:17.840 --> 2:58:20.780]  I think we are going to make it to the election.
[2:58:20.780 --> 2:58:25.840]  My concern is what I'm calling 77 days of chaos.
[2:58:25.840 --> 2:58:32.560]  That is the period between post-election and the inauguration, because the way these people
[2:58:32.560 --> 2:58:39.240]  operate, I see them, along with the Chai comms, who are waiting in the wings that have troops
[2:58:39.240 --> 2:58:45.400]  in the above our northern and our southern borders now that's been proven, waiting to
[2:58:45.400 --> 2:58:49.120]  do a red dawn 2.0.
[2:58:49.120 --> 2:58:54.600]  I think that they're going to not stop at wreaking total chaos, and I agree with what
[2:58:54.600 --> 2:58:56.320]  Mike Adams just said.
[2:58:56.320 --> 2:59:01.280]  He has intel showing that these people are actually going to be provocateurs disguising
[2:59:01.280 --> 2:59:08.320]  themselves as Trump supporters, patriots, military, and police, supporting what Trump's
[2:59:08.320 --> 2:59:12.320]  doing, but actually carrying out false flag terrorist attacks.
[2:59:12.320 --> 2:59:13.320]  I totally agree.
[2:59:13.320 --> 2:59:17.760]  The main thing left is economic collapse, war, and false flag, and false flag is the
[2:59:17.760 --> 2:59:22.440]  big one, I totally agree with you, and I just, I just why we're winning right now, but that
[2:59:22.440 --> 2:59:26.400]  makes me think, my God, what are they about to pull in their desperation?
[2:59:26.400 --> 2:59:32.360]  Yeah, because I just see them wanting to cause a totally chaotic situation, because that's
[2:59:32.360 --> 2:59:38.360]  the last, for lack of a better term, Trump card, to stop him from getting in and finishing
[2:59:38.360 --> 2:59:41.440]  up what he started in 2016.
[2:59:41.440 --> 2:59:45.840]  Can you believe how real, Steve, how real Trump is, I mean, I mean, I'm not trying to
[2:59:45.840 --> 2:59:51.800]  like kiss somebody's ass here, but I mean, my God, what he does at 74, it's just insane.
[2:59:51.800 --> 2:59:53.800]  Thanks for the call, Steve.
[2:59:53.800 --> 3:00:01.040]  Now, we're 82 days out, so I guess he's right, 77 days.
[3:00:01.040 --> 3:00:05.840]  That is a math wrong, when I said 79 days of hell, it's 77 days of hell, it's 78 days
[3:00:05.840 --> 3:00:11.160]  of hell, whatever, there's 77 days of hell coming after the election.
[3:00:11.160 --> 3:00:14.960]  I just one day was like checking my, see, that shows you that don't listen to me.
[3:00:14.960 --> 3:00:18.240]  The callers like 77 days, like, was that right?
[3:00:18.240 --> 3:00:24.240]  I think technically it's 78 days, we actually look at it, but it varies, huh?
[3:00:24.240 --> 3:00:29.400]  Okay, let's talk to Emmanuel in California.
[3:00:29.400 --> 3:00:30.400]  Thanks for calling.
[3:00:30.400 --> 3:00:31.400]  Hey, Alex.
[3:00:31.400 --> 3:00:37.200]  I just want to say thank God for this moment in time and history, you know, for our Lord
[3:00:37.200 --> 3:00:41.960]  Jesus Christ, our Savior, for giving us knowledge, you know, thank you for the products as well.
[3:00:41.960 --> 3:00:43.360]  I really enjoy them.
[3:00:43.360 --> 3:00:47.520]  I appreciate you, brother Rolier, because of you, I mean it.
[3:00:47.520 --> 3:00:55.320]  And this election, this pivotal point, and all of eternity before eternity, we're seeing
[3:00:55.320 --> 3:00:59.760]  the spiritual blindness of the world, the reason why these people so diluted is because
[3:00:59.760 --> 3:01:06.320]  they're spiritually dead, there's no knowledge of God, there's no God in our culture.
[3:01:06.320 --> 3:01:09.920]  You're right, Emmanuel, these people literally, and you look at people that don't have God,
[3:01:09.920 --> 3:01:15.240]  I look at real Christians, they're like electric, black, white, or brown, they're like electric.
[3:01:15.240 --> 3:01:19.440]  You look at people that aren't loving God, they look dead, there's nothing there.
[3:01:19.440 --> 3:01:24.480]  Yeah, there's no light in their eyes, but what I want to get on with the election is
[3:01:24.480 --> 3:01:32.240]  that I think Trump is unstoppable, I think Trump is such a godsend for this country to
[3:01:32.240 --> 3:01:36.800]  give us this grace and mercy for the last four years, because I think just as much as
[3:01:36.800 --> 3:01:46.560]  2020 accelerated, we're going to see 2021 to 2025 accelerate even faster, and China is
[3:01:46.560 --> 3:01:53.440]  just, they're so reckless, so brute in what they want to do, how they're getting in Central
[3:01:53.440 --> 3:01:58.320]  America, they're going into Canada and buying up all these businesses, they're setting,
[3:01:58.320 --> 3:02:03.040]  they set their first form based off in Africa, military based in Africa.
[3:02:03.040 --> 3:02:10.080]  This country, if the US goes into civil war and we become so distracted in fighting ourselves,
[3:02:10.080 --> 3:02:13.600]  I think that gives China such an open playing field to do whatever they want,
[3:02:14.160 --> 3:02:17.120]  grab any sources they want, and it was just really,
[3:02:17.120 --> 3:02:20.160]  Emmanuel, I totally agree with you, God bless her.
[3:02:20.160 --> 3:02:24.560]  Let me play a short little gift that's out there of a bunch of SJW women, mainly white women,
[3:02:24.560 --> 3:02:28.480]  the blue and pink hair, I don't care your hair's blue or pink, but it's all unnatural,
[3:02:28.480 --> 3:02:33.840]  they all want to just, I'm into abortion, I'm into death, I love China, I hate America,
[3:02:33.840 --> 3:02:38.560]  and China would just line them up and shoot them, they're just so stupid, they're just
[3:02:38.560 --> 3:03:05.600]  rebelling against their own providence, here it is.
[3:03:05.600 --> 3:03:08.400]  All right, let's go to Wendy in Pennsylvania, thanks for holding, welcome.
[3:03:10.400 --> 3:03:13.840]  Hello, Alex. Thanks for calling, go ahead, thank you.
[3:03:14.720 --> 3:03:21.680]  My name is Wendy Seminario, and I would like for you to please bring up my profile picture
[3:03:21.680 --> 3:03:25.200]  on Facebook. Well, I don't know if we have the time to do that, we're not really into
[3:03:25.200 --> 3:03:28.880]  giving last names, because you know why? People can call in and say there's somebody else,
[3:03:29.520 --> 3:03:33.120]  or you can call in and say you're George Jones and you're not, but we really appreciate you
[3:03:33.120 --> 3:03:39.280]  calling, what do you want to tell folks about today? Okay, well, if you bring up my profile
[3:03:39.280 --> 3:03:47.120]  picture, I have learned that profile pictures are not censored on Facebook, and so my last
[3:03:47.120 --> 3:03:53.040]  profile picture was up for weeks with a picture of the fan.video site on it. Oh, I get it, and I'm
[3:03:53.040 --> 3:03:55.920]  being a jerk and complaining, you get it, some folks calling and trying to say there's somebody
[3:03:55.920 --> 3:04:00.160]  else, I get it, you're saying profile pictures aren't censored on Facebook, so you can make
[3:04:00.160 --> 3:04:04.720]  your profile, that's a smart point, wow, make it whatever you want, like band.video or election
[3:04:04.720 --> 3:04:11.040]  night.news. I would like for you to bring it up, so you can actually see it. We'll try,
[3:04:11.040 --> 3:04:24.880]  just what's your name again? Wendy W. E. N. D. Y. Seminario S. E. M. I. N. E. R. I. O.
[3:04:25.520 --> 3:04:29.840]  Wendy Seminario, all right, we'll pull that up, and we'll probably make an ad out of this,
[3:04:29.840 --> 3:04:33.360]  because it's really important, getting around censors, tell folks what you've been doing.
[3:04:34.080 --> 3:04:38.000]  Yeah, this is a great way to get a whole lot of truth out, imagine if all the Patriots
[3:04:38.000 --> 3:04:44.000]  have something similar during this critical time. You found a critical hole in the enemy's
[3:04:44.000 --> 3:04:50.400]  defenses, tell us how you discovered it, tell us what you did. I don't know, I just thought of it,
[3:04:50.400 --> 3:04:55.600]  and I thought it was a great idea. Well, okay, the reason I thought of it, I was the one that called
[3:04:55.600 --> 3:05:02.800]  the other day, and I hadn't been on Facebook, and so I actually put a site on Facebook, and I was
[3:05:02.800 --> 3:05:09.360]  censored, and I was told that if I did it again, I could lose my account. And I was so, I was so
[3:05:09.360 --> 3:05:14.080]  upset, I was like, okay, how do I get around this? And I put it up as my profile picture,
[3:05:14.080 --> 3:05:19.040]  and it's been up for weeks, and they have not censored me. Well, that's beautiful,
[3:05:19.040 --> 3:05:24.000]  yeah, because the AI has trouble reading pictures, so they hate memes. And so instead of giving up,
[3:05:24.000 --> 3:05:26.960]  you found a way around it, which is the essence of victory.
[3:05:28.000 --> 3:05:30.640]  Yes, thank you so much for all you're doing, Alex.
[3:05:30.640 --> 3:05:33.920]  No, no, you're awesome, Wendy, thank you, sorry, I didn't understand it first,
[3:05:33.920 --> 3:05:38.080]  and I trust you, you sound awesome. We've had people before call and said they're another person's
[3:05:38.080 --> 3:05:43.120]  name, and then the poor person, you know, gets a problem. Look, Matt and Thomas,
[3:05:46.960 --> 3:05:50.080]  we're gonna take your calls, and then Matt Bracken's gonna take over. I don't want to
[3:05:50.080 --> 3:05:54.080]  cut into Matt, but I promise to get all your calls. So Thomas and Denver and Matt,
[3:05:54.080 --> 3:05:57.040]  we're gonna come to you, and then halfway in the segment, we'll hand the baton to Matt Bracken
[3:05:57.040 --> 3:06:03.040]  of enemiesfarndomestic.com. Thomas says that COVID is the globalist agenda to restructure,
[3:06:03.040 --> 3:06:07.920]  absolutely, it's their admitted reset. We've got to get that word out, the folks will talk to you,
[3:06:07.920 --> 3:06:12.000]  and then Matt with Trump vaccine COVID madness, one of my biggest problems with Trump is to
[3:06:12.000 --> 3:06:15.840]  promote the vaccine. I know what he's doing, I know Bill Gates is pissed, I understand what
[3:06:15.840 --> 3:06:20.800]  Trump's doing, I still don't agree with it. And then listeners, I see him online saying,
[3:06:20.800 --> 3:06:26.240]  Jones agrees with forced inculations. That's false witness, that's not true. We'll be right back,
[3:06:26.240 --> 3:06:36.640]  stay with us. I get asked all the time by the listeners, by the media, what am I most proud of
[3:06:36.640 --> 3:06:41.280]  when it comes to the show, and it's the fact that info war is more than 25 years ago doing basic
[3:06:41.280 --> 3:06:46.480]  research with what the club of Rome and the CFR and others were actually saying, developed the
[3:06:46.480 --> 3:06:51.680]  hypothesis that communist China had been set up to take our jobs and transfer them to China,
[3:06:51.680 --> 3:06:56.320]  and then make us economically destitute and position us into debt. Well, now China owns the
[3:06:56.320 --> 3:07:01.520]  debt, now China owns Hollywood, all the one side of trading deals. It turns out our analysis was
[3:07:01.520 --> 3:07:06.800]  absolutely dead on, but again, it wasn't that hard, the CFR and others admitted what they were doing,
[3:07:06.800 --> 3:07:13.600]  but still others didn't want to focus on that issue. We did, and you focused on it by supporting us
[3:07:13.600 --> 3:07:18.080]  at info wars. So when you go to infowarstore.com and get all the great supplements, books,
[3:07:18.080 --> 3:07:23.040]  t-shirts, films, water filtration, air filtration, all of it, you're funding the organization that
[3:07:23.040 --> 3:07:27.040]  literally helped make up the world what's really happening. So that's a big accomplishment for
[3:07:27.040 --> 3:07:34.640]  all of you. I want to thank you for your support. Election 2020 is here, and whether Trump wins or
[3:07:34.640 --> 3:07:40.720]  loses, we have all won by exposing the communist Chinese, by exposing the globalist, by exposing
[3:07:40.720 --> 3:07:47.280]  the pedophile rings, by exposing the fact this is really a fight between good versus evil. Now,
[3:07:47.280 --> 3:07:50.800]  I'm personally a Christian and I believe in God, and I know God's real and I've experienced it in
[3:07:50.800 --> 3:07:55.600]  my life, but even if you don't believe in God, it's important to recognize that there is goodness
[3:07:55.600 --> 3:07:59.760]  world, there is evil, and there are people out there that want to do you harm because they enjoy
[3:07:59.760 --> 3:08:06.400]  doing bad. And what I see happening across the spectrum of different political views is people
[3:08:06.400 --> 3:08:12.240]  finally get that, they finally understand that they're not being naive anymore. Don't ever project
[3:08:12.240 --> 3:08:18.240]  your decency and your goodness onto other people until they've proven what they stand for and who
[3:08:18.240 --> 3:08:22.320]  they are, or you're going to get hurt. But those of you out there have done your own research and
[3:08:22.320 --> 3:08:26.800]  discovered who's good and who is faithful will then come together with those organizations and
[3:08:26.800 --> 3:08:31.440]  support them like Info Wars, because without your support, Info Wars would not exist.
[3:08:56.800 --> 3:09:00.640]  In Denver and then Matt, Ohio, go ahead, call her from Denver, Tomas, go ahead.
[3:09:01.360 --> 3:09:07.280]  Tomas in Denver, Abercudabra, how are you Alex? I love it, man, no call ever said Abercudabra.
[3:09:07.280 --> 3:09:12.880]  Man, I'm here, brother, I'm glad to be on air with you. Hey, I was born on the land called Denver,
[3:09:12.880 --> 3:09:18.240]  Colorado, and I'm a man who's free, down with the communists. I called to share the solution to
[3:09:18.240 --> 3:09:23.680]  the mass, to the vaccines, to even your court issues. I was, you've helped me throughout the years.
[3:09:23.680 --> 3:09:28.480]  I watched you for 12 years, first time caller. It's not about the coronavirus, it's about the
[3:09:28.480 --> 3:09:33.680]  crown virus. Man is king here. When another man tries to force you to put on a mask,
[3:09:34.560 --> 3:09:39.120]  you should identify that man. When you've been to court, Alex, you've never identified any man in
[3:09:39.120 --> 3:09:44.560]  that court. You never made a man provide you with valid state issue driver license, a judge,
[3:09:44.560 --> 3:09:49.920]  a prosecutor, a cop, anyone that they're doing it by contract. This is the law of the sea.
[3:09:49.920 --> 3:09:55.120]  You know that the occult is best hidden in plain sight. It's the law of the sea. It's the law of
[3:09:55.120 --> 3:09:58.800]  the sea. Well, I agree. A lot of the system tricks you into waving your rights. So, and I agree,
[3:09:58.800 --> 3:10:04.720]  wearing the mask, taking the contact tracing. This is a takeover. And they use an all cap
[3:10:04.720 --> 3:10:10.960]  text called dog Latin to get everybody's consent. You are consenting to wear the mask.
[3:10:10.960 --> 3:10:15.840]  You never identify the man that takes jurisdiction over you. Require that they provide you idea if
[3:10:15.840 --> 3:10:20.000]  they want to take jurisdiction over you. Make them hold the obligation of the language that they use
[3:10:20.000 --> 3:10:25.120]  as well as the benefit. No, you're right, because it's the bad guys that wear masks. They're literally
[3:10:25.120 --> 3:10:31.840]  putting us into like a eyes wide shut cult. He's a person, Alex. Mask equals person. They want you
[3:10:31.840 --> 3:10:37.200]  in person when you do commerce. They're restricting the commerce. These people are not. Exactly.
[3:10:37.200 --> 3:10:41.360]  Nobody can go to court. Nobody can face their accusers now. You can't face them. They're wearing
[3:10:41.360 --> 3:10:46.160]  a mask. This is really, they know what they're doing. You're right. Next time you're in court,
[3:10:46.160 --> 3:10:50.560]  make every person in that court provides. No, they don't even have court now. I can't even get
[3:10:50.560 --> 3:10:54.960]  into court when I need stuff now. Exactly. That's what's happening because man is king and they know
[3:10:54.960 --> 3:10:59.680]  that man is walking this earth again. I walk in the creator's law statutes and codes are for the
[3:10:59.680 --> 3:11:03.600]  legal side. No, I agree. They're they're panicking because we the people woke up and they're shutting
[3:11:03.600 --> 3:11:09.200]  down our rightful systems. Beautiful point, Thomas. Amazing. Call me back again. Matt,
[3:11:09.200 --> 3:11:13.680]  in Ohio, then Matt Bracken takes over. Matt, go ahead. Hey, how's it going? How's it going,
[3:11:13.680 --> 3:11:18.000]  Mr. Jones? Man, I am just living in the middle of insane asylum. I mean, it's just
[3:11:18.000 --> 3:11:23.120]  good stuff's happening. Bad stuff's happening. It's just crazy. I enjoyed your podcast the other
[3:11:23.120 --> 3:11:26.800]  day of Rogan and how does that ask you before I get to my point? What time will you be on
[3:11:26.800 --> 3:11:31.680]  with Rogan on Monday? I should say, I mean, you know, I just wanted to come on a little bit,
[3:11:31.680 --> 3:11:34.640]  but Joe's like come on the whole time, but we're going to be having our own live coverage. So I'll
[3:11:34.640 --> 3:11:39.440]  be here part of the time. I'm on with Ted Nugent. I'm on with drinking roast podcast. So I'm going
[3:11:39.440 --> 3:11:44.480]  to be running around doing a lot of stuff that day. It's crazy. Within three miles of each other,
[3:11:44.480 --> 3:11:48.640]  there's all these big podcasting facilities set up. We were here first. It's like a
[3:11:48.640 --> 3:11:52.640]  black hole. We drew everybody into us, but we're going to be doing a lot of stuff election night
[3:11:52.640 --> 3:11:58.160]  coverage, brother. So you're going to be on Crowder too. Crowder's show. Yes, I'm going to be on
[3:11:58.160 --> 3:12:03.680]  Crowder too. You're paying attention. Yeah, that's awesome. I can't wait for that. I love when
[3:12:03.680 --> 3:12:10.640]  you're on Crowder too. I had a crack tooth that day, which is horrible pain. I got a compound
[3:12:10.640 --> 3:12:15.280]  fracture hurt less when I was like 16. And I mean, this tooth broke the day before I was on Joe's
[3:12:15.280 --> 3:12:19.360]  show. He was doing sober October. I said, give me a bottle of whiskey, which they had a huge room
[3:12:19.360 --> 3:12:24.000]  of whiskey. Literally, Joe's a big whiskey guy. And I like bang that back. So I didn't do the best
[3:12:24.000 --> 3:12:28.400]  job, but it made the tooth they go away. The tooth's pulled down. So I'm good, but beautiful,
[3:12:28.400 --> 3:12:31.920]  brother. What else is going on? That was the best. I thought that was the best podcast I've
[3:12:31.920 --> 3:12:35.760]  watched out of all the words I've watched with you, to be honest. And I think you should get
[3:12:35.760 --> 3:12:40.800]  Tim Dillon on your show sometime. You two, honestly, were very entertaining together.
[3:12:40.800 --> 3:12:45.520]  You know, you know, Tim is really, really, really smart. What about Trump vaccine and COVID madness?
[3:12:46.400 --> 3:12:50.080]  Yeah, well, that's what I was going to call about. Sorry about that. I ain't talking in a minute.
[3:12:50.080 --> 3:12:56.160]  But about the Gavi, did you see back in, I think it was about June, he came out and donated money
[3:12:56.160 --> 3:13:02.160]  towards the Gavi foundation, which Bill and Melinda Gates had a hand in. So that's what had me,
[3:13:02.160 --> 3:13:06.400]  you know, confused about Trump. Well, he cut off a bunch of their funding. But yeah, one of the
[3:13:06.400 --> 3:13:11.520]  foundations he funded does help them. Absolutely. Trump did that. Yeah. Yeah. So that's what has
[3:13:11.520 --> 3:13:15.680]  me concerned is because I was pushing this operation warp speed in a vaccine, you know,
[3:13:15.680 --> 3:13:19.920]  because I do want to vote for Trump. I know Biden's evil, but that's just the thing that kind of
[3:13:19.920 --> 3:13:24.240]  scared me from. I don't agree. But did you notice how pissed Gates got about it and said,
[3:13:24.240 --> 3:13:29.120]  don't take that vaccine, take nine. He's taking power away from them. Doesn't mean I agree with it.
[3:13:29.120 --> 3:13:31.200]  But what I predicted Trump was doing is what he's doing.
[3:13:32.240 --> 3:13:35.760]  It's just a very dangerous game. Like, like you said, though, you know, I just hope Trump doesn't,
[3:13:35.760 --> 3:13:39.440]  I think Trump doesn't know what he's doing. He's paying plan 40 chest. Oh, listen,
[3:13:39.440 --> 3:13:44.960]  Trump betrays us. He does force inoculations. I'll turn against him in T minus zero seconds.
[3:13:44.960 --> 3:13:50.560]  Oh, bam. Just like that. God bless you, man. All right. Matt Bracken takes over enemies,
[3:13:50.560 --> 3:13:56.560]  foreign domestic.com Matt Bracken, then Owen shore in the war room in T minus 35 minutes.
[3:14:00.400 --> 3:14:06.720]  Matt Bracken, go ahead, sir. All right. Hey, wow, Alex, what great guests are your audience is
[3:14:06.720 --> 3:14:12.160]  amazing. The last Matt was so on point and he follows the show. I mean, he's dialed in.
[3:14:12.960 --> 3:14:18.240]  So even with this media blackout against, you know, the big story, the, the, uh,
[3:14:18.240 --> 3:14:25.280]  Bob Alinsky story, we're just working around it. They say on the internet that, um, that any kind
[3:14:25.280 --> 3:14:32.160]  of of a blockage is just worked around like an organic plant, just working around an obstacle,
[3:14:32.160 --> 3:14:36.400]  putting its way. And I think that's what's happening. You know, while we're talking about
[3:14:36.400 --> 3:14:44.080]  that forced vaccine, the way that I look at it, Trump is pushing warp speed because he has to.
[3:14:44.080 --> 3:14:50.080]  If he doesn't get reelected, it doesn't, nothing else will matter. If a vaccine comes out of it,
[3:14:50.080 --> 3:14:56.640]  that's, that actually works. Okay, fine. But I don't see Trump ever making a mandatory vaccine.
[3:14:57.280 --> 3:15:03.200]  You know, he, um, he was the first thing he did when he got in was get rid of the account,
[3:15:03.200 --> 3:15:10.160]  Obamacare mandate. That was really the guts of Obamacare. The fact that you had to pay for it.
[3:15:10.160 --> 3:15:15.840]  It was right on your, on your tax forms. You had to pay for it. First thing right off,
[3:15:15.840 --> 3:15:22.240]  he tore out that mandate. I don't see him as a mandate guy. You know, while Biden is doing his,
[3:15:22.240 --> 3:15:29.680]  his little, uh, his, his little, uh, traveling show in the circles, you know, with 20 or 30 people
[3:15:29.680 --> 3:15:37.120]  way socially distanced in circles, Trump is making masks optional. So more and more people,
[3:15:37.120 --> 3:15:41.360]  I just saw the last one that he had, half the people weren't wearing masks at all. And they're
[3:15:41.360 --> 3:15:47.520]  definitely not socially distancing. This is a signal that he believes we are, are actually
[3:15:47.520 --> 3:15:52.720]  turning the corner on this coronavirus. We have to do it like Sweden and just work your way through
[3:15:52.720 --> 3:15:59.760]  it. The absolute worst thing to do is go the Australia route, 111 days of lockdown. All that
[3:15:59.760 --> 3:16:05.200]  does is, is put the virus on ice. And when you declare a lockdown over, it just starts right
[3:16:05.200 --> 3:16:10.720]  up where it was. The only way to get through this thing is to get through it. And I think
[3:16:10.720 --> 3:16:17.040]  after Trump is reelected, if he's reelected, you know, they'll still be working on the vaccine,
[3:16:17.040 --> 3:16:22.640]  but I think it's going to be completely optional. And Trump usually when he talks about the vaccine,
[3:16:23.200 --> 3:16:30.240]  he also in the same, in the same paragraph talks about the, um, medicinals and the fact that,
[3:16:30.240 --> 3:16:36.320]  that, uh, you know, the virus is probably attenuating and we're going to have to just learn to live
[3:16:36.320 --> 3:16:42.480]  with it like we have with every virus. You know, we, we, we can't just a lockdown society. All that
[3:16:42.480 --> 3:16:49.040]  does is crush the economy. And absolutely, if he tried to do forced vaccines, that would be one
[3:16:49.040 --> 3:16:54.800]  of the most sure ways of kicking off a shooting civil war that I can imagine. Because the way
[3:16:54.800 --> 3:16:58.880]  that they would do it, obviously they're not going to go house to house, you know, with doctors and
[3:16:58.880 --> 3:17:05.840]  SWAT teams and needles. They're going to say you can't enter your bank without your vaccine ID card,
[3:17:05.840 --> 3:17:11.920]  or you can't, you know, your AT, your ATM card won't work unless you've got the, uh, you know,
[3:17:11.920 --> 3:17:17.520]  the vaccine symbol on it, you know, that, that's computer readable. That's an absolute red line
[3:17:17.520 --> 3:17:22.880]  in our country. That's the logo. So I don't think we need to worry about a Trump vaccine. It's never
[3:17:22.880 --> 3:17:31.360]  going to happen. Biden, maybe, and we'll continue this on the other side. Something huge has happened
[3:17:31.360 --> 3:17:37.760]  in the last two weeks. Remember when Hunter Biden's laptop first broke and all of big tech
[3:17:38.400 --> 3:17:45.200]  in concert from Twitter to Facebook to YouTube, Google, all worked to block it. They didn't deny
[3:17:45.200 --> 3:17:51.040]  that it was real. They just wouldn't let anybody even talk about the story or link to major newspapers
[3:17:51.040 --> 3:17:57.040]  or even the House and Senate committees that we're looking at. Well, now fast forward as the
[3:17:57.760 --> 3:18:02.640]  fire hose of information comes out and more tapes get released and more audio with Hunter admitting
[3:18:02.640 --> 3:18:07.120]  he was a Communist Chinese agent. We're not trying to censor it anymore. Not because they're good
[3:18:07.120 --> 3:18:13.600]  people, but because this cryzan effect boomeranged on their traitorous butts last time just a few
[3:18:13.600 --> 3:18:17.920]  weeks ago. And so now they know that trying to suppress it only makes it bigger, just like they've
[3:18:17.920 --> 3:18:23.440]  done with Info Wars in Band-Aid video. It's truly amazing. So keep telling the truth. The Lord works
[3:18:23.440 --> 3:18:27.840]  in mysterious ways. Amazing things are happening and these Communist Chinese agents are going to pay.
[3:18:29.360 --> 3:18:35.760]  Are you sick and tired of your calm, peaceful life? Are you sleeping too well at night? Is your city too
[3:18:35.760 --> 3:18:44.800]  safe? Well, not anymore. Introducing Democrats. Politicians so incompetent they'll fill your
[3:18:44.800 --> 3:18:52.880]  neighborhood with riots, looting, rampant violence and even homelessness. The secret is a special
[3:18:52.880 --> 3:18:59.920]  blend of corruption and good old-fashioned stupidity. No more pesky law and order. When Democrats are
[3:18:59.920 --> 3:19:06.880]  in charge, nobody's safe. Simply vote for Democrats, sit back and watch your neighborhood burn to the
[3:19:06.880 --> 3:19:13.760]  ground. But wait, vote for Democrats now and bill include rolling blackouts, election fraud,
[3:19:13.760 --> 3:19:20.960]  cancel culture, taxes and more taxes. Democrats bringing chaos right to your front door.
[3:19:29.520 --> 3:19:34.960]  Much of the time on big issues and societal developments, Info Wars is many, many years
[3:19:34.960 --> 3:19:41.200]  ahead and almost all the time we are tomorrow's news today. But there's a blind spot that Info
[3:19:41.200 --> 3:19:45.360]  Wars has and I've noticed that really informed people have this as well. I know a lot of you
[3:19:45.360 --> 3:19:49.360]  tuning in are some of the most performable out there so I want you to be retrospective
[3:19:49.360 --> 3:19:54.880]  and kind of examine yourself because that's what I do every day. This Hunter Byte laptop is important
[3:19:54.880 --> 3:20:00.880]  but the new audio confirmed to be him where he admits he works under the Communist Chinese spy
[3:20:00.880 --> 3:20:08.560]  chief. He should be arrested right now. That is so huge that is hiding in plain view and it's getting
[3:20:08.560 --> 3:20:14.640]  almost no attention. We have to get that information out to everybody. It's all posted on InfoWars.com,
[3:20:14.640 --> 3:20:20.640]  so many other major patriotic sites but we need to get it out to everybody and remember that we
[3:20:20.640 --> 3:20:25.200]  know all of this. We knew it a long time ago so when it breaks down we kind of go okay tell us
[3:20:25.200 --> 3:20:39.840]  that we didn't know. The point is now it's documented, now it's proven. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:20:39.840 --> 3:20:59.920]  Live from Austin, Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones and now your host Matt Bracken.
[3:20:59.920 --> 3:21:12.000]  During this segment I want to talk a little bit about the Tony Bobolinski situation but I want
[3:21:12.000 --> 3:21:18.320]  to throw in a few insights that I really haven't seen anywhere. Tony Bobolinski if you've seen
[3:21:18.320 --> 3:21:25.680]  the picture of him in uniform he was definitely a buff Chad back in the day in the 90s in college.
[3:21:25.680 --> 3:21:33.520]  You know he looks like he's been eating pretty well lately but when he was in college he was
[3:21:33.520 --> 3:21:42.160]  a walk on to the wrestling team at Penn State okay a walk on no scholarship tried out for the team
[3:21:42.160 --> 3:21:50.640]  and made it. The guy is a stud all right certified. When he got commissioned into the Navy I haven't
[3:21:50.640 --> 3:21:57.040]  seen that he was in NROTC Penn State does have a naval ROTC program. I haven't seen that he might
[3:21:57.040 --> 3:22:02.480]  have been some form of a direct commission which I don't quite understand how that happened but
[3:22:03.200 --> 3:22:11.280]  he did his four years in the Navy like I did after I went to UVA in the 70s NROTC.
[3:22:11.280 --> 3:22:21.360]  He went from college to the to the Navy's nuclear power training command. This requires a little
[3:22:21.360 --> 3:22:28.720]  bit of explanation. If you are a pretty smart guy in college NROTC or at one of the academies
[3:22:29.360 --> 3:22:36.720]  you know you've got a 3.5 or so average and you've kept your nose clean physically you're
[3:22:36.720 --> 3:22:42.480]  doing everything that you've you know you've got to do you're in great shape you get a choice of
[3:22:42.480 --> 3:22:47.280]  whether you want to go into submarines or you have the good eyes you can fly fly planes.
[3:22:48.560 --> 3:22:57.360]  If you are a guy that's got like 1600 math SATs who's who's got a 4.0 and is taking advanced
[3:22:57.360 --> 3:23:05.440]  calculus in college upon commissioning the Navy is going to actively steer you into one of their
[3:23:05.440 --> 3:23:13.840]  true brainiac communities which is either going to be related to cryptography or nuclear power
[3:23:15.680 --> 3:23:20.800]  because they know that guys like this like Tony Bobalinsky they probably aren't going to spend
[3:23:20.800 --> 3:23:26.320]  a career in the Navy. They're not trying to cultivate them necessarily for the 20-year career
[3:23:26.320 --> 3:23:31.760]  while they've got this brainiac for the four years at least they're going to put you somewhere
[3:23:31.760 --> 3:23:39.600]  where they can harness that brain power and for Tony Bobalinsky that was the nuclear power training
[3:23:39.600 --> 3:23:45.680]  command within with a above top secret clearance or to top secret clearance with an emphasis on
[3:23:45.680 --> 3:23:54.480]  nuclear secrets. He's very read into operational security and keeping secrets and he's obviously
[3:23:54.480 --> 3:24:01.760]  a very very smart guy. He's made enough money in the last 15 years since graduating from college
[3:24:02.560 --> 3:24:09.680]  that he attracted the attention of the the Biden crime family because they needed somebody who
[3:24:09.680 --> 3:24:15.920]  actually had a proven track record in setting up you know these international business deals
[3:24:15.920 --> 3:24:20.560]  that could actually do it because they had no idea what they're doing. They're literally
[3:24:20.560 --> 3:24:27.040]  you know strap hanging on Air Force One or Air Force Two into places like the Ukraine
[3:24:27.680 --> 3:24:34.800]  and seeking out corrupt officials to take their money but for the China deal they needed to raise
[3:24:34.800 --> 3:24:40.320]  this to a higher level of professionalism and that's where Tony Bobalinsky came in.
[3:24:41.040 --> 3:24:48.880]  This guy is nobody's fool. He is not going to be taken for a ride even with this media blackout
[3:24:48.880 --> 3:24:56.880]  going on. Now it's been mentioned that you know the lost documents of Tucker Carlson being FedExed
[3:24:56.880 --> 3:25:04.560]  I presume FedEx from the east coast to LA. It looks like they were intercepted by the FBI
[3:25:05.600 --> 3:25:13.040]  who has portals along the way under the Patriot Act. They're watching the bloody package they want
[3:25:13.040 --> 3:25:20.640]  by its tracking document and can divert it at any point as if it was containing anthrax or
[3:25:20.640 --> 3:25:27.920]  bomb making materials. There's already a system, a protocol. So the question will be this diversion
[3:25:27.920 --> 3:25:33.200]  is it going to show up officially? Will it be you know time stamped into the FBI system or is
[3:25:33.200 --> 3:25:40.160]  this some sort of a rogue operation? It's going to be hard for the FBI or Department of Homeland
[3:25:40.160 --> 3:25:47.600]  Security to say we had nothing to do with it because using that system to grab that package
[3:25:47.600 --> 3:25:53.120]  obviously they don't have people in the line watching packages to send a message to have that
[3:25:53.120 --> 3:26:00.560]  tracking number diverted for inspection is going to require some kind of document electronic
[3:26:00.560 --> 3:26:07.520]  documentation. So we'll see how this all plays out but you have to think of this in terms of a
[3:26:07.520 --> 3:26:12.960]  type of a poker game where you don't show all your cards at once. There's a method that was
[3:26:12.960 --> 3:26:20.080]  perfected by Andrew Breitbart then later Steve Bannon and the Project Veritas guys
[3:26:21.040 --> 3:26:27.600]  where you put up an incriminating video or an incriminating document against your adversaries
[3:26:27.600 --> 3:26:34.240]  to get a reaction, to go them into denying that it's real, knowing that you have five more cards
[3:26:34.240 --> 3:26:40.800]  to play. This as they learn this game it forces them to just shut up and not make denials just
[3:26:40.800 --> 3:26:46.160]  like the Bidens haven't made any denials because they know there's many more cards to be played in
[3:26:46.160 --> 3:26:52.480]  this deck. You know that that Bob Linsky, Carlson and others are going to have more evidence to
[3:26:52.480 --> 3:27:00.000]  produce in the coming days. So if you're the deep state actor working hand in glove with the Bidens
[3:27:00.000 --> 3:27:06.480]  the corrupt FBI officials that hid Hunter Biden's laptop during the impeachment, right,
[3:27:06.480 --> 3:27:12.560]  when it could have exonerated the president, they hid it, sat on it even while the president,
[3:27:12.560 --> 3:27:18.000]  the legitimate president of the United States was being impeached over bogus Ukraine charges,
[3:27:18.640 --> 3:27:27.680]  the FBI hid it. So are there now FBI people willing to open the Fox, the Fox News package
[3:27:27.680 --> 3:27:33.120]  to get the documents? Why would they do that? Allegedly there are copies. Well you do that so
[3:27:33.120 --> 3:27:40.720]  that you can see what are all the cards in the deck. What's the bottom, the lowest bid, the final
[3:27:40.720 --> 3:27:47.360]  card? You know you want to know what is the worst damage that we have to prepare for. That's why
[3:27:47.360 --> 3:27:53.440]  it's valuable to intercept something like this. It's not to just destroy it because everybody
[3:27:53.440 --> 3:27:59.680]  would assume there's copies, electronic copies. It's so that you know what your adversary has in
[3:27:59.680 --> 3:28:05.440]  store for you so that you can do your most effective form of damage control. That's what's
[3:28:05.440 --> 3:28:13.200]  going on there. What's really amazing to me is that is that we are seeing a Soviet level news
[3:28:13.200 --> 3:28:19.920]  blackout. I saw something today and I actually made a meme out of it. It's just a chart showing
[3:28:19.920 --> 3:28:28.160]  the minutes that have been aired on Tony Bobolinski's revelations in the last three days.
[3:28:29.040 --> 3:28:43.680]  And Fox News and Fox Business have aired a couple hours total, but ABC, CNN, NBC, MSNBC, NPR, none,
[3:28:43.680 --> 3:28:52.400]  zero, not a minute. I mean this is really going full Soviet. Facebook, Twitter, they're doing
[3:28:52.400 --> 3:28:58.240]  all they can to throttle it and suppress it and prevent people from seeing it. So now on Twitter
[3:28:59.360 --> 3:29:04.400]  you can go to the New York Post and post a link, but the New York Post itself is still locked out
[3:29:04.400 --> 3:29:09.360]  of Twitter. So this is going to be a real litmus test for our country going forward.
[3:29:09.360 --> 3:29:16.400]  The journalists who refused to even mention the name Tony Bobolinski are going to in the future
[3:29:16.400 --> 3:29:23.520]  be branded like with a scarlet letter and sort of like collaborators, you know, with deep state
[3:29:23.520 --> 3:29:31.360]  intelligence collaborators. It's gotten so bad now that Glenn Greenwald, who founded the Intercept,
[3:29:31.360 --> 3:29:38.560]  a website called the Intercept, it's his website. He now lives in Brazil though and the paper
[3:29:38.560 --> 3:29:45.440]  is edited, not paper, but the website is edited and put out of New York. He was not allowed
[3:29:45.440 --> 3:29:54.000]  to produce, to publish an article about this media blackout on Tony Bobolinski on the Intercept,
[3:29:54.000 --> 3:30:01.280]  which he founded. I've seen this before where the creator of a website will give the password
[3:30:01.280 --> 3:30:07.360]  keys to somebody else eventually and they fall out. And the originator of a website is locked
[3:30:07.360 --> 3:30:12.400]  out of his own website. Apparently that happened to Glenn Greenwald. So he had, he's quit the
[3:30:12.400 --> 3:30:18.320]  Intercept, which is his own ship. And so that he can write about this episode outside of the,
[3:30:18.320 --> 3:30:25.040]  of the Intercept. We really are in full Soviet days. And we'll, we'll continue this thread
[3:30:25.040 --> 3:30:43.520]  on the other side of the commercials, but there's a lot more to talk about. The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[3:30:43.520 --> 3:30:56.240]  Infowars has been banned, arrested, attacked and threatened because we are effective.
[3:30:57.760 --> 3:31:04.080]  The great awakening is here. Go to banned.video, download the videos and share.
[3:31:04.080 --> 3:31:15.200]  Support the information war at infowarstore.com. And never give up the fight.
[3:31:15.200 --> 3:31:33.680]  I want us to sink in. I want to sink in real good and to everybody listening, including
[3:31:33.680 --> 3:31:39.280]  my own brain. This lockdown is incredibly sinister and has already started with 2 million people
[3:31:39.280 --> 3:31:45.520]  to death. It is designed to incrementally be slowly tightened down around our necks. They are never
[3:31:45.520 --> 3:31:51.840]  going to release it. That's why Trump coming out and saying we cannot quote beat the virus by
[3:31:51.840 --> 3:31:56.960]  staying locked up. We have to get herd immunity. It's not as deadly as they said it's so important
[3:31:56.960 --> 3:32:03.200]  because this is a UN Bill Gates globalist deployed corporate takeover where their businesses are all
[3:32:03.200 --> 3:32:09.120]  essential but our businesses aren't. This is destroying the world economy by design.
[3:32:09.120 --> 3:32:14.480]  This is economic warfare. This is war crime. And now they're coming with the attempted force
[3:32:14.480 --> 3:32:19.680]  inoculations that Gates is pushing. Well you know what that is. That violates the Geneva Convention,
[3:32:19.680 --> 3:32:26.560]  the Nuremberg Code and so much more. Please spread the words. Please tell folks about banned.video
[3:32:26.560 --> 3:32:32.480]  and the facts that are posted there. The miraculous properties of turmeric have been
[3:32:32.480 --> 3:32:38.000]  admired and even worshiped for thousands of years by ancient civilizations. With modern science we
[3:32:38.000 --> 3:32:45.280]  know why turmeric is so popular. It's antioxidant effect. It's anti-inflammatory effect. Everything
[3:32:45.280 --> 3:32:52.000]  it does is simply amazing. And most turmerics out there are simply food products. They're 3 to 5%
[3:32:53.040 --> 3:33:01.280]  curcuminoid. But we have bodies ultimate turmeric formula with a 95% curcuminoid level.
[3:33:01.280 --> 3:33:05.520]  And then we have other organic products in there that accelerate it and bring it into the cells
[3:33:05.520 --> 3:33:10.160]  of the body. It's been sold out for months. It's back in stock. And despite that, bodies ultimate
[3:33:10.160 --> 3:33:17.600]  turmeric formula at infowarstore.com is 50% off with free shipping and triple patriot points
[3:33:17.600 --> 3:33:23.040]  at infowarstore.com. It's bodies ultimate turmeric formula. If you haven't tried it,
[3:33:23.040 --> 3:33:28.240]  learn why it's got thousands of five-star reviews at infowarstore.com. And you can't lose. It funds
[3:33:28.240 --> 3:33:36.000]  the infowar. In January and February of the year 2020, the communist super state China working
[3:33:36.000 --> 3:33:41.840]  through the United Nations told the world how we are now supposed to live our lives after COVID.
[3:33:41.840 --> 3:33:48.480]  Permanent social distancing, permanent mask, apps that track everywhere we go, and what we do,
[3:33:48.480 --> 3:33:55.520]  contact tracers come into our doors with the police and dragging us away. This is the authoritarian
[3:33:55.520 --> 3:34:01.680]  medical tyranny takeover. And it's never going to end until we start standing up and saying no.
[3:34:01.680 --> 3:34:07.920]  Already Fauci and the WHO and the communist Chinese are all over the news saying the lockdowns are
[3:34:08.480 --> 3:34:15.200]  permanent. Bill Gates said at least 10 years last week until restrictions are raised. By then we'll
[3:34:15.200 --> 3:34:21.360]  all be totally and completely trained to live under slavery and it will never end. This is the
[3:34:21.360 --> 3:34:27.680]  authoritarian takeover. Everyone must resist. Everyone must speak up. Everyone must say no now.
[3:34:27.680 --> 3:34:57.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones with
[3:34:57.200 --> 3:35:10.800]  Matt Bracken. I'd like to mention a poem here. I recommend getting print and copies of types
[3:35:10.800 --> 3:35:17.360]  of books that might be made unavailable in the future if Biden wins, which means Kamala Harris
[3:35:17.360 --> 3:35:26.960]  will be president by Easter. No matter what happens if Biden wins, whether he quits because of his
[3:35:26.960 --> 3:35:34.080]  senility or he quits because of the corruption charges that are coming against him, he's gone.
[3:35:34.080 --> 3:35:39.040]  All he is is a placeholder, a Trojan horse. So don't even think in terms of President Biden.
[3:35:39.680 --> 3:35:47.520]  No matter what, if he wins, it's Kamala Harris. And don't think that it'll save us that he's
[3:35:47.520 --> 3:35:54.240]  impeached over corruption. That'll be just as well for the Democrats because it doesn't matter how
[3:35:54.240 --> 3:35:59.040]  Kamala Harris gets to become president. They're going to pack the Supreme Court,
[3:35:59.040 --> 3:36:04.880]  Venezuela style, and that's the last free election we'll ever have. So what's really
[3:36:04.880 --> 3:36:11.840]  going on? You're pulling back from a national and American view and then going further out
[3:36:11.840 --> 3:36:17.680]  to seeing a global view. Probably one of the most important things that I've seen in the last
[3:36:17.680 --> 3:36:25.360]  couple of weeks is a term which would have gotten you banned on Facebook or Twitter a couple of
[3:36:25.360 --> 3:36:32.880]  months ago because it was like a conspiracy theory by paranoid right-wingers. Now they're just
[3:36:32.880 --> 3:36:38.000]  throwing the mask off and saying, what do you mean you can't say it? We're proud of it. It's
[3:36:38.000 --> 3:36:44.560]  called the Great Reset. It's on the cover of Time Magazine where they're rebuilding the world.
[3:36:44.560 --> 3:36:52.320]  There's a guy named Klaus Schwab who's a hancho at the World Economic Forum. That's the Davos gang
[3:36:52.320 --> 3:36:59.920]  very closely aligned with the Bilderbergers and Illuminists and the rest of that super globalist
[3:36:59.920 --> 3:37:07.120]  crowd. So who is really running this? Is this a corporate takeover of the world or is it the
[3:37:07.120 --> 3:37:13.360]  chai comms that are taking over the world? Actually, it's both. It's a synthesis. That's what
[3:37:13.360 --> 3:37:23.360]  we're seeing the tech giants, Zuckerberg and the rest, they're very happy going along with a Chinese
[3:37:23.360 --> 3:37:30.160]  style social credit system because this is for them the Great Reset. This is the synthesis
[3:37:30.160 --> 3:37:39.920]  between global corporatism and communism. Keep in mind, communist China in the old-fashioned sense of
[3:37:39.920 --> 3:37:45.840]  the term isn't really even a communist country anymore. They don't believe in Marxism, Leninism.
[3:37:45.840 --> 3:37:51.920]  There's Chinese billionaires right and left. Their factory workers are in the worst conditions
[3:37:51.920 --> 3:37:59.760]  anywhere on the planet. So it's not as if we're talking about red Chinese, Marxist, Leninist style.
[3:38:00.400 --> 3:38:06.640]  They're just a fascist, corporatist country now with the greatest level of repression of any major
[3:38:06.640 --> 3:38:16.000]  country on the planet. Jack Dorsey, Zuckerberg, Google, YouTube, they're happy to see Chinese
[3:38:16.000 --> 3:38:24.160]  social control coming to the entire world. It means nobody will be able to defy them at all.
[3:38:24.160 --> 3:38:32.320]  Anybody who does just won't be allowed to go on the internet. You'll just be shut out of PayPal,
[3:38:32.320 --> 3:38:38.400]  shut out of PayPal, shut out step by step. Like Alex said, you'll go into your bank and they're
[3:38:38.400 --> 3:38:44.560]  going to say, bad comrade, get out. We don't want you or your family. This is really full Soviet.
[3:38:45.360 --> 3:38:50.080]  It's like the Tony Bobolinsky litmus test I was talking about in the last segment.
[3:38:50.800 --> 3:39:00.560]  When you have every network other than Fox and Fox Business not giving one second to the Tony
[3:39:00.560 --> 3:39:07.680]  Bobolinsky story. They went out with its Russian disinformation and they just stuck with that story.
[3:39:07.680 --> 3:39:14.400]  They never budged, even though Bobolinsky has got all the receipts. He's got the phone conversations,
[3:39:14.400 --> 3:39:21.760]  the recordings, the documents, the meetings. These Soviet media people won't even ask Biden,
[3:39:21.760 --> 3:39:29.120]  have you ever met Tony Bobolinsky? They're fully protecting him. They are in full Soviet mode.
[3:39:29.120 --> 3:39:36.160]  Absolutely, they would say, the sky is green if headquarters told them to say the sky is green.
[3:39:37.120 --> 3:39:44.720]  The next day, they would say, the sky is purple. They would never say they had said anything else.
[3:39:44.720 --> 3:39:54.320]  It's exactly like Soviet media probed and isvestia during that era. Their idea is that if this news
[3:39:54.320 --> 3:40:02.480]  is only restricted to Fox and conservative talk shows and alternate internet like info wars,
[3:40:02.480 --> 3:40:08.240]  it won't matter because they think two-thirds of the country will never hear about it. That'll be
[3:40:08.240 --> 3:40:17.120]  enough for them to drag Biden across the line. I wonder if this is true or are we really networking
[3:40:17.120 --> 3:40:25.680]  around this type of censorship? At the grassroots level, are people sharing Tucker Carlson's videos
[3:40:25.680 --> 3:40:31.600]  and other news about this? Or are there really two-thirds of the country that don't know who
[3:40:31.600 --> 3:40:38.000]  Tony Bobolinsky is, that are still going to vote for Biden? It makes me wonder because this is
[3:40:38.000 --> 3:40:46.080]  really a seminal moment. This is a turning point really in human history. We're going to see if
[3:40:46.080 --> 3:40:52.000]  Biden wins, he'll be gone by Easter one way or the other. Kamala Harris will be president.
[3:40:52.000 --> 3:40:58.560]  They're going to pack the Supreme Court. Absolutely, it's going to happen. With 50 senators, that's
[3:40:58.560 --> 3:41:03.600]  all they need. If they have 50 senators, so they need to pick up a couple seats. Remember though,
[3:41:03.600 --> 3:41:09.040]  just like with president at the presidential level, they'll be doing the same amount of
[3:41:09.040 --> 3:41:15.280]  ballot stuffing and cheating to get a couple of senators in. If they have 50 senators,
[3:41:15.280 --> 3:41:21.520]  then the vice president for now, Kamala Harris, is the 51, she's the deciding vote.
[3:41:22.240 --> 3:41:30.000]  They'll make D.C. and Puerto Rico states, then they'll have 54 senators. They're going to pack
[3:41:30.000 --> 3:41:36.400]  the Supreme Court and that's all she wrote. Because just like in Venezuela, they won't ever
[3:41:36.400 --> 3:41:42.240]  need to have another fair election. They'll come after the guns. Kamala Harris has said,
[3:41:42.240 --> 3:41:50.000]  within 100 days, she's going to ban semi-automatic rifles. And if the Congress doesn't give her a
[3:41:50.000 --> 3:41:56.720]  law along those lines, she's going to do it by executive order. Now, this obviously is a lunatic
[3:41:56.720 --> 3:42:04.240]  idea. All it's going to do is instigate a kinetic civil war. But I don't know if you would
[3:42:05.680 --> 3:42:11.920]  ascribe Kamala Harris to being just a useful idiot, a person who really believes she can
[3:42:11.920 --> 3:42:19.040]  politically do these things, or is she deep down more on the Bolshevik end, where they believe
[3:42:19.040 --> 3:42:24.960]  in the saying, the worse, the better. And they're not satisfied with just a political takeover of
[3:42:24.960 --> 3:42:31.920]  the country. What they want is to absolutely wreck any chance of the American Republic rebuilding
[3:42:31.920 --> 3:42:39.280]  ever. Just like in Venezuela, Venezuelans went to the polls the first time with Hugo Chavez.
[3:42:39.280 --> 3:42:45.040]  He won, and conservatives thought that's okay in four years. He'll wreck the country,
[3:42:45.040 --> 3:42:49.120]  they'll be so unpopular, they'll vote us back in. There was no second chance.
[3:42:50.400 --> 3:42:55.440]  See, Hugo Chavez packed the Venezuelan Supreme Court, just like they're planning to do here.
[3:42:56.240 --> 3:43:02.000]  And after that, every law that Hugo Chavez wanted passed, passed immediately, and their
[3:43:02.000 --> 3:43:08.800]  Supreme Court backed it up. These included disarming the Venezuelans. So this is going
[3:43:08.800 --> 3:43:15.840]  to be coming, if Biden wins, Kamala Harris will be the president early in the spring.
[3:43:16.480 --> 3:43:21.280]  They're going to come after the guns. And you won't be able to complain about it because
[3:43:21.280 --> 3:43:26.640]  if you do, you're going to be shut out of social media for hate. They'll pass all kind of new hate
[3:43:26.640 --> 3:43:32.320]  speech laws and laws for the preservation of civil order. So you're not going to be able to
[3:43:32.320 --> 3:43:38.320]  say anything that in their definition disturbs the social order. And when they start doing
[3:43:38.320 --> 3:43:44.560]  selected gun confiscation raids, anybody who resists will be branded as a terrorist.
[3:43:45.200 --> 3:43:52.000]  Every law set up to prevent terrorism in our country will be turned against patriots
[3:43:52.000 --> 3:43:58.640]  who refuse to go along with gun confiscation. This is absolutely the plan. They are following
[3:43:58.640 --> 3:44:04.560]  the Venezuela playbook to the letter. They don't mind that the country is starving.
[3:44:04.560 --> 3:44:13.200]  They don't mind that the country is in shambles because they will be impermanently at the
[3:44:13.200 --> 3:44:20.240]  top of the pyramid. Even if the pyramid is a wasteland below them, they will be at the very
[3:44:20.240 --> 3:44:26.480]  top. Every state will mirror California. You'll have homeless, you'll have riots,
[3:44:27.520 --> 3:44:33.520]  you'll have looting, and there will be nothing that anyone can do about it because those in
[3:44:33.520 --> 3:44:39.760]  charge are living in mansions inside of gated communities with full security. They'll be
[3:44:39.760 --> 3:44:45.920]  traveling by helicopter and armored limousine past all of the homeless camps and tent cities.
[3:44:45.920 --> 3:44:53.840]  It won't bother them a bit because all of the special privileges will be given to the political
[3:44:53.840 --> 3:45:00.640]  class and to the police that protect them. As we can see with the FBI today, there are plenty
[3:45:00.640 --> 3:45:06.320]  of corrupt officials who are willing to sell out their country as long as they can be on what they
[3:45:06.320 --> 3:45:13.280]  see as the winning side, the side in permanent power. I'm happy to talk to you and maybe we'll
[3:45:13.280 --> 3:45:21.200]  talk again after the election. It's just in a few days. We're only here on air facing the
[3:45:21.200 --> 3:45:25.680]  globalist onslaught, the DMC-funded lawsuits, and everything that's happening because of you. We
[3:45:25.680 --> 3:45:30.960]  built the only truly multi-media independent radio TV print film organization in the world
[3:45:30.960 --> 3:45:34.880]  that promotes the truth against the globalist. We've had a devastating effect. We're a national
[3:45:34.880 --> 3:45:39.920]  treasure. You're a national treasure for supporting us. And so go get a t-shirt. Go get a historic
[3:45:39.920 --> 3:45:45.280]  t-shirt. We've got a funny one that's the Biden groping a woman. It's a woman's design shirt.
[3:45:45.280 --> 3:45:48.880]  My wife really likes it. She sent me this gift. It's pretty cute. Here it is. And it just, you
[3:45:48.880 --> 3:45:52.560]  know, it's a little historic thing. I think Trump's gonna win, but if Biden's able to steal it,
[3:45:52.560 --> 3:45:56.320]  we'll be probably shut down pretty quick. So it'll be historic thing to have. You'll only be able
[3:45:56.320 --> 3:46:00.880]  to fight them in the third dimension on the street with graffiti, with handbills you hand out,
[3:46:00.880 --> 3:46:05.760]  and with non-compliance, not paying taxes, and pulling your kids out of the schools, and just
[3:46:05.760 --> 3:46:10.800]  making it a full-time job to expose and fight and obstruct the criminal foreign takeover of America.
[3:46:10.800 --> 3:46:15.040]  We've gotten to that point. Biden's for nursing home. I hope to retire Biden. That'd be a collector's
[3:46:15.040 --> 3:46:20.640]  item. Get it while you still can. We're not ordering more. infowarstore.com. As I take this
[3:46:20.640 --> 3:46:26.320]  announcement, we were exactly 14 days out from the election, and the globalist-controlled Democrats
[3:46:26.880 --> 3:46:31.360]  know that America has woken up to them and turned against them. The whole planet is a huge,
[3:46:31.360 --> 3:46:36.800]  populous realignment. And so they've openly said, we need to go to pure authoritarianism,
[3:46:36.800 --> 3:46:42.160]  not just censorship, but physically attacking and arresting anyone that doesn't submit to our
[3:46:42.160 --> 3:46:47.120]  agenda. And they're on record saying that once they remove Trump, they are going to persecute
[3:46:47.120 --> 3:46:53.760]  you, Trump's base, and going to try to prosecute us and put us all in prison. This is what all the
[3:46:53.760 --> 3:46:58.880]  old Clintinesas are saying. It's what the Obama bots are saying. It's what Keith Overman's saying.
[3:46:58.880 --> 3:47:04.800]  It's what Nancy Pelosi's saying. This is their stated criminal authoritarian intent,
[3:47:05.760 --> 3:47:09.760]  and they intend to keep the lockdowns going forever and forced inoculations. Trump is
[3:47:09.760 --> 3:47:15.680]  trying to end the lockdowns, and the sick vaccines will be voluntary. Donald Trump or die.
[3:47:15.680 --> 3:47:19.520]  We've got to get Trump in. Everybody get out there and vote and tell your family to vote now.
