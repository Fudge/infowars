[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:20.840]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[00:20.840 --> 00:29.280]  welcome to the alex jones show i'm david night and joining us now is alex jones
[00:29.280 --> 00:35.720]  alex of course folks david thank you david is going to be on showing the
[00:35.720 --> 00:39.320]  operation today for the next three hours then of course in the fourth hour of one
[00:39.320 --> 00:42.880]  of the other great crew members that taking over now we've expanded to the
[00:42.880 --> 00:45.880]  fourth hour then of course there's the nightly news seven o'clock central i'm
[00:45.880 --> 00:52.200]  joining you via audio skype from the mountains in south texas i'll just leave
[00:52.200 --> 00:57.640]  it at that but we are down here let's just say investigating things slash also
[00:57.640 --> 01:01.840]  getting some rnr because all work and no play makes alex jones completely
[01:01.840 --> 01:06.760]  insane and not just a dull boy but we are here investigating a whole bunch of
[01:06.760 --> 01:10.800]  different stuff but as i sit here with this little cafe off the side of the
[01:10.800 --> 01:15.720]  highway i noticed they've got a couple fake owls sitting out to keep a birds
[01:15.720 --> 01:19.360]  from coming and roosting that's kind of what the second amendment is for
[01:19.360 --> 01:24.800]  criminals and bad people in government is it's a warning but we have teeth you
[01:24.800 --> 01:31.800]  know we have beaks we have claws we have talons we're not prey animals to be fed
[01:31.800 --> 01:36.920]  on so that's kind of how my brain works without allegory a couple days ago we
[01:36.920 --> 01:39.480]  were just going to do a shoot in front of google as we were downtown and i
[01:39.480 --> 01:45.000]  thought this is their headquarters of their rollout in austin for fiber and a
[01:45.000 --> 01:48.120]  bunch of other stuff and they always claim they're open to the public let's go
[01:48.120 --> 01:52.320]  walk in with a camera and the people they're doing an event also the google
[01:52.320 --> 01:57.000]  people freaked out said get out call the police on us and we just did this to
[01:57.000 --> 02:01.600]  illustrate that google's surveilling everyone but that we're not supposed to
[02:01.600 --> 02:07.160]  surveil them openly and publicly and this one event you obviously won't save
[02:07.160 --> 02:13.280]  the world but it just puts a spotlight back on google and big brother and what's
[02:13.280 --> 02:16.520]  happening i mean google drives around with its cars taking photos of your
[02:16.520 --> 02:20.120]  house grabbing your passcodes breaking into what you're doing and then if you
[02:20.120 --> 02:24.440]  supposedly criticize it you know you're a horrible person so anything you see
[02:24.440 --> 02:27.680]  already coming up the next segment to kind of talk a little bit about it with
[02:27.680 --> 02:30.960]  david night then at the bottom of the hour he's gonna be back with david and
[02:30.960 --> 02:34.720]  we're gonna air that piece the video is simultaneously of your radio listener
[02:34.720 --> 02:39.840]  we'll go up on info wars dot com but that said david i know you're gonna be
[02:39.840 --> 02:44.520]  covering a lot of news today there's a lot of really important articles that
[02:44.520 --> 02:51.760]  are key to all this on info wars dot com right now here's one of them by steve
[02:51.760 --> 02:55.440]  Watson i think should be red linked i think we should do a nightly news report
[02:55.440 --> 02:58.640]  on this we should make a big focus on this just like drudge focused on
[02:58.640 --> 03:02.160]  pointing out that government has bodyguards but we don't mean everybody
[03:02.160 --> 03:06.240]  already knows that but we really push that as a meme and now we've got people
[03:06.240 --> 03:09.360]  in presidential debates bringing it up we've got articles every day about it
[03:09.360 --> 03:15.880]  it's it's really a meme that's that's gaining a lot of steam gaining a lot of
[03:15.880 --> 03:19.840]  power we have you know james woods calling for obama to go up to secret
[03:19.840 --> 03:25.000]  service i mean it really is our crescendo of us collectively showing our
[03:25.000 --> 03:30.320]  power and beating a drum harmonically until it brings down brings down the
[03:30.320 --> 03:34.520]  house and here's another example iceland is the answer for the world they were
[03:34.520 --> 03:39.840]  told they owed something like eighty five ninety billion dollars to go back to the
[03:39.840 --> 03:43.640]  time six years ago during the banker bailout at the end of 2008 globally they
[03:43.640 --> 03:47.080]  just arrested their finance ministers got all the documents and found that they
[03:47.080 --> 03:51.000]  owed about four billion dollars or less in fact some estimates were less than a
[03:51.000 --> 03:55.480]  billion but the point is they debated a billion four billion was the max some
[03:55.480 --> 03:57.960]  estimates was low as eight hundred million the point is eight million to four
[03:57.960 --> 04:02.360]  billion they've paid back several billion of it now with interest and they've
[04:02.360 --> 04:06.800]  now arrested 26 corrupt bankers that were involved in the scam it turns out
[04:06.800 --> 04:12.720]  the head finance minister had signed the government on to big british swiss and
[04:12.720 --> 04:16.880]  u.s. banks debt that wasn't theirs and why is that important it's the exact same
[04:16.880 --> 04:23.320]  model here in the United States in Greece in Spain in Portugal in Italy
[04:23.320 --> 04:28.080]  where the number is normally above 90% of the debt that we're signed on to is
[04:28.080 --> 04:33.280]  not ours just like we have 19 trillion of debt that's u.s. debt but even signed on
[04:33.280 --> 04:36.640]  to way more other international obligations things that aren't our
[04:36.640 --> 04:40.200]  debts and then the bankers that basically haunt show all this they're able
[04:40.200 --> 04:45.200]  to get full control over society so there is that extremely important article
[04:45.200 --> 04:48.480]  up on info wars dot com David take us out on the comeback and hit a few other
[04:48.480 --> 04:52.760]  articles but there's a lot of positive things happening right now we're gonna

[06:10.280 --> 06:14.080]  this key urn that has been traditionally used by civilizations for

[08:19.920 --> 08:25.380]  Alex Jones show on this Friday October 23rd 2015 I'm David Knight joining me in
[08:25.380 --> 08:30.900]  studio is Anthony Gucci arty and also joining us on outside the studio is
[08:30.900 --> 08:35.820]  Alex Jones Alex that's right gentlemen I'm gonna hand the baton over to you
[08:35.820 --> 08:39.660]  gentlemen in just a minute or two and then of course we have this Google
[08:39.660 --> 08:44.820]  report coming up that is somewhat entertaining also informative but really
[08:44.820 --> 08:51.180]  holds the seed in it to the take down of the globalist if we physically begin to
[08:51.180 --> 08:55.260]  take action in even peaceful ways putting our bodies against the gears of
[08:55.260 --> 08:59.660]  big brother big brother will grind to the mud like so other so many other
[08:59.660 --> 09:03.780]  tyrannies of the past first I want to get people some of the bad news today and
[09:03.780 --> 09:06.940]  obviously you're gonna get into the Benghazi hearings yesterday you're gonna
[09:06.940 --> 09:10.860]  get into the economic news you're gonna get into a huge amount of stuff here
[09:10.860 --> 09:15.140]  today but here's why they're trying to censor our free speech because it is
[09:15.140 --> 09:19.940]  effective two articles on info wars.com that gives us a good news this is the
[09:19.940 --> 09:23.860]  bad news Arizona high school bans patriotic gear from football game can't
[09:23.860 --> 09:26.820]  have American flags things like that it's seen as hurtful seen as racist
[09:26.820 --> 09:30.420]  yesterday we have major groups student groups calling for getting rid of Thomas
[09:30.420 --> 09:34.900]  Jefferson statues this this is the cultural Marxism that we face then
[09:34.900 --> 09:40.420]  another article here this already happens with iPhones where if you try to type
[09:40.420 --> 09:43.420]  words that are politically incorrect into it it basically won't let you type
[09:43.420 --> 09:46.780]  it that's been going on for a couple years over and over again changes the
[09:46.780 --> 09:51.740]  word for you can't even type cuss words it changes you know the f word to duck
[09:51.740 --> 09:55.860]  things like that and you can say well that's okay no that is prior restraint
[09:55.860 --> 09:59.900]  of free speech and as the essence of tyranny here's another article
[09:59.900 --> 10:07.140]  Silicon Valley expert says use pop-ups to shame people who make offensive posts
[10:07.140 --> 10:11.140]  with which means you're being surveilled again in real time being controlled a
[10:11.140 --> 10:17.900]  very very serious situation now getting in to the good news I mentioned it a
[10:17.900 --> 10:21.420]  little bit earlier Silicon Valley you know trying to restrict free speech and
[10:21.420 --> 10:25.740]  things like that because they're aware of what's happened in Iceland and the
[10:25.740 --> 10:30.300]  globalists are very afraid of Iceland a country of 400,000 people had a debt
[10:30.300 --> 10:33.620]  between 800 million and 4 billion depending on which independent outside
[10:33.620 --> 10:37.540]  group looked at it the globalists were saying it was close to 100 billion that
[10:37.540 --> 10:41.220]  they owed you know just absolutely ridiculous then that got reduced out of
[10:41.220 --> 10:46.660]  10 they said no we're not doing it they found out their finance minister had
[10:46.660 --> 10:50.900]  signed them on to foreign debts that weren't even theirs and made money off
[10:50.900 --> 10:54.660]  the fees so they've already arrested six or seven of them and convicted them in
[10:54.660 --> 10:59.700]  the last six seven years since 2008 they're the only country to stand up in
[10:59.700 --> 11:03.140]  unilateral we say this debt isn't ours it's a fraud instead of just arguing that
[11:03.140 --> 11:07.380]  the debts are untenable like Nigeria you know we'll get a billion dollar loan
[11:07.380 --> 11:12.020]  into paying a hundred billion dollars on it over 30 40 years it's not a real debt
[11:12.020 --> 11:15.620]  it's beyond loan sharking and they control the finance ministers that
[11:15.620 --> 11:18.740]  manipulate the countries in the collapse so no one else has ever said no in
[11:18.740 --> 11:22.460]  modern history but the Russians to a certain extent through the oligarchs
[11:22.460 --> 11:28.460]  out and now of course Iceland so the headline today Iceland has now sent 26
[11:28.460 --> 11:33.540]  corrupt bankers to prison 74 years of sentences for high-level fraudsters
[11:33.540 --> 11:38.140]  US and rest of Europe bailed theirs out that article needs to be red linked by
[11:38.140 --> 11:45.300]  Steve Watson at the top of the page that needs to be pushed out everywhere
[11:45.300 --> 11:51.620]  because this is the model to take us out of this 15 years yet again to the
[11:51.620 --> 11:55.180]  crisis in Syria for five years orchestrated by the globalist and NATO
[11:55.180 --> 11:58.780]  funding al-Qaeda known as al-Nuzra now change the name to ISIS to confuse the
[11:58.780 --> 12:02.740]  public Turkey says Russian effort against jihadist in Syria will drive
[12:02.740 --> 12:06.940]  100,000 more illegal migrants into Europe Turkey is staging the illegals
[12:06.940 --> 12:11.940]  and they're mainly jihadist supporters that couldn't take over Syria they came
[12:11.940 --> 12:15.380]  in to take over Syria as the new population as they took over major
[12:15.380 --> 12:20.540]  cities this has been admitted most are military aged men they've got fake
[12:20.540 --> 12:26.580]  passports they're now being segwayed into Europe out of Turkey into Hungary
[12:26.580 --> 12:30.180]  into Romania then into Austria then into Germany then into France then into
[12:30.180 --> 12:34.940]  Spain then into Portugal then into Sweden then into the rest that is in the
[12:34.940 --> 12:39.420]  UK taking over the tunnel again two days ago shutting down the tunnel under
[12:39.420 --> 12:43.380]  the English Channel because thousands were pouring in hijacking trucks hijacking
[12:43.380 --> 12:49.500]  drains raping murder and killing you cannot exaggerate how insane this is and
[12:49.500 --> 12:52.940]  they have the nerve to claim the Russians trying to stabilize Syria and
[12:52.940 --> 12:57.060]  trying to control the borders and blocking people getting into Turkey it's
[12:57.060 --> 13:01.460]  going to cause the refugee crisis so this is the massive bait and switch that
[13:01.460 --> 13:06.780]  we're seeing now shifting gears back to you guys and handing the baton over this
[13:06.780 --> 13:13.300]  Google piece is is fun it's it's it's it's interesting I don't claim you know
[13:13.300 --> 13:16.980]  that it's going to save the world as I said earlier and it's Google headquarters
[13:16.980 --> 13:22.220]  in Austin and it just illustrates how the individuals there wanted their
[13:22.220 --> 13:25.180]  privacy that work at Google and the private group that was having an event
[13:25.180 --> 13:28.100]  I have nothing against them but I was simply trying to illustrate Google's
[13:28.100 --> 13:33.980]  tracking everything you do watching you and listening to you and so we were
[13:33.980 --> 13:38.340]  simply there to draw attention to it and if more people whether it's Walmart or
[13:38.340 --> 13:41.980]  whether it's McDonald's or whether it's Coca-Cola or whether it's Monsanto or
[13:41.980 --> 13:44.860]  whether it's any of these globalist corporations that give money to the
[13:44.860 --> 13:49.020]  anti-gun agenda and other garbage that's why we're angry Google does as well
[13:49.020 --> 13:52.780]  we're going to come and we're going to confront you just in a friendly way and
[13:52.780 --> 13:58.100]  the other good news is it just illustrates how like the police are in
[13:58.100 --> 14:01.540]  many areas the country they call the police on us and they go look your
[14:01.540 --> 14:04.460]  door is open you say it's over the public you have a sign saying you can't
[14:04.460 --> 14:08.620]  have a camera you got to tell him now that that you're not open to the public
[14:08.620 --> 14:11.980]  and that and that he can't have a camera and then everybody goes no no no now
[14:11.980 --> 14:16.460]  you can come in or not against this lady we're there pulling this
[14:16.460 --> 14:21.340]  uncomfortable stunt to illustrate things for her and for others inside so that's
[14:21.340 --> 14:27.220]  coming up at the bottom of the hour but again ladies and gentlemen this is what
[14:27.220 --> 14:32.380]  it's all about I intend to go to people's houses and ask if I can put a
[14:32.380 --> 14:35.460]  camera in their home next week they're gonna flip out and say of course you
[14:35.460 --> 14:39.660]  can also just let me put in your house for free let me sell the data and then
[14:39.660 --> 14:44.420]  I'll show them Samsung articles on an iPad or maybe on a Samsung computer
[14:44.420 --> 14:48.260]  Samsung tablet how they're watching and listening to you and admitting and saying
[14:48.260 --> 14:53.060]  I did this to illustrate this for you show you understand we're also gonna go
[14:53.060 --> 14:56.220]  to different pro open border people's houses and say we're here with a moving
[14:56.220 --> 15:00.740]  van we're here to move in we're migrants let me in pay for my food and board or
[15:00.740 --> 15:04.140]  your racist and I may bring a pregnant woman and claims she's gonna have the
[15:04.140 --> 15:07.860]  baby right there in their house because we've got to illustrate how ridiculous
[15:07.860 --> 15:11.140]  this is then I'm gonna call the news when the cops show up I'm gonna say these
[15:11.140 --> 15:14.500]  are racist they must let me in their house to live here of course that's
[15:14.500 --> 15:18.420]  ridiculous but I have to illustrate the absurdity by being completely absurd
[15:18.420 --> 15:23.460]  gentlemen excellent job Anthony and David continue breaking down the
[15:23.460 --> 15:26.980]  information and of course I'll be back popping in Sunday then of course back
[15:26.980 --> 15:30.900]  with you Monday with David night co-hosting the transmission also be
[15:30.900 --> 15:33.780]  filing reports from the road if you're watching or listening to this
[15:33.780 --> 15:38.380]  transmission ladies and gentlemen the bottom line is you are the resistance so
[15:38.380 --> 15:42.180]  take action against the globalist today thank you Alex I'm really looking
[15:42.180 --> 15:45.500]  forward to seeing that video of you storming Google and of course we have
[15:45.500 --> 15:50.340]  Anthony Gutiarty with us because he was with Alex he's gonna be telling us what
[15:50.340 --> 15:53.740]  happened from his perspective as he was there we've got a piece to play for you
[15:53.740 --> 15:58.820]  at the bottom of the hour and this is all very very important and let me tell
[15:58.820 --> 16:02.580]  you why this is important Alex gave you examples of it he said well I'm gonna go
[16:02.580 --> 16:06.620]  around and ask people if I can put a camera in their home at that point I'll
[16:06.620 --> 16:10.540]  do it for free you know you'll just have a free camera there but then of course if
[16:10.540 --> 16:15.660]  you did that at that point Alex would own that video he could put it up on our
[16:15.660 --> 16:19.460]  website he could put it on fun YouTube he could put it on cable whatever he could
[16:19.460 --> 16:23.660]  also turn that information over to the government and that's what the government
[16:23.660 --> 16:28.060]  has been working toward for a very long time with the support of the companies
[16:28.060 --> 16:32.500]  involved in collecting information on you they all say that information belongs
[16:32.500 --> 16:37.100]  to them so they can share it with the government that's what CISPA has been
[16:37.100 --> 16:41.140]  about from the very beginning now we've fought this battle multiple times under
[16:41.140 --> 16:46.900]  multiple names the idea and of course CISPA stands for a cyberspace
[16:46.900 --> 16:51.380]  information sharing protection act they've taken the P out I think it was
[16:51.380 --> 16:56.020]  because they started asking well who exactly is this protecting well that
[16:56.020 --> 17:00.260]  would be protecting the corporations from any liability of you suing them
[17:00.260 --> 17:04.060]  because they turn over the information that they're collecting on you to the
[17:04.060 --> 17:09.940]  government and so now we have a the newest instantiation of CISPA which is
[17:09.940 --> 17:14.980]  now CISPA they just took the P out and that is moving forward there's an article
[17:14.980 --> 17:19.660]  up on info wars.com these 83 senators just voted to expand surveillance did
[17:19.660 --> 17:24.380]  your senators vote to empower big brother because that's precisely what this is
[17:24.380 --> 17:30.020]  why should you be concerned about this of course we just had the anniversary of
[17:30.020 --> 17:35.780]  of back to the future the 2015 a couple of days ago that was a day in the movie
[17:35.780 --> 17:38.940]  that they went forward to the future so a lot of people were talking to the
[17:38.940 --> 17:42.740]  writers about this and the writer said hey of course in the future they ask
[17:42.740 --> 17:45.980]  him what do you see things going another 30 years in the future he goes well of
[17:45.980 --> 17:50.220]  course there'll be nothing like privacy but that's fine we'll just you know we'll
[17:50.220 --> 17:54.060]  just all know that everything that we do will be public knowledge everywhere I
[17:54.060 --> 17:58.260]  don't really have a problem with that he said well I do because it can be
[17:58.260 --> 18:03.380]  misconstrued it can be used against you it can even be used to blackmail our
[18:03.380 --> 18:07.660]  elected officials our high elected officials there's questions about what's
[18:07.660 --> 18:10.660]  going on with Joe Biden why didn't he run against Hillary Clinton many people
[18:10.660 --> 18:14.980]  believe that the Clinton war machine was threatening his past present and
[18:14.980 --> 18:19.500]  future reputation that was an article by Paul Joseph Watson at info wars.com
[18:19.500 --> 18:23.980]  yesterday we know that they've collected information on multiple Supreme Court
[18:23.980 --> 18:30.060]  justices there was an amazing reversal by the Chief Justice Roberts on Obamacare
[18:30.060 --> 18:33.620]  first writing an opinion against Obamacare saying you don't have any
[18:33.620 --> 18:38.900]  constitutional authority to go inside a state and make people buy a product from
[18:38.900 --> 18:44.020]  a corporation of course they don't and then he wrote the other side abruptly
[18:44.020 --> 18:47.140]  just before they released the opinion so we have this strange thing we not only
[18:47.140 --> 18:50.860]  flip-flop but he wrote both the consenting and dissenting opinions many
[18:50.860 --> 18:55.020]  people I'm one of them believe that he was blackmailed so that's the situation
[18:55.020 --> 18:59.500]  that we're faced with when you can blackmail individual leaders I mean we
[18:59.500 --> 19:02.620]  have to worry about this constantly you have to worry about this with the
[19:02.620 --> 19:06.620]  speakers races coming up but this is another way that it applies directly to
[19:06.620 --> 19:11.340]  you and of course this is a a news item that was up on info wars.com just
[19:11.340 --> 19:15.660]  yesterday the UK goes full or well government to take children away from
[19:15.660 --> 19:19.740]  parents if they think they might become radicalized how do you think they might
[19:19.740 --> 19:24.060]  define radicalized well that's completely arbitrary isn't it we've
[19:24.060 --> 19:28.580]  seen people who voted for Ron Paul and had a sticker on their car that they
[19:28.580 --> 19:34.260]  voted for Ron Paul labeled as potential radicals so this can be used to destroy
[19:34.260 --> 19:38.100]  your family can be used to take your freedoms tell us Anthony when we come
[19:38.100 --> 19:41.860]  back we're going to talk about what's coming up at the bottom of the hour we
[19:41.860 --> 19:46.940]  have Alex storming Google because that's where the information is being
[19:46.940 --> 19:50.780]  collected as much if not more so than by the NSA stay with us we'll be right
[19:50.780 --> 19:53.020]  back
[20:00.460 --> 20:06.220]  earthquake floods winter storms prolonged power outages or war each of us
[20:06.220 --> 20:10.220]  have had that moment when we recognize that we need to be better prepared we
[20:10.220 --> 20:13.420]  typically do the same thing we start with food storage then we address the
[20:13.420 --> 20:17.700]  need for water but have you considered heat storage I'm talking about staying
[20:17.700 --> 20:21.980]  warm in the cold here are some things for you to consider how will I keep my
[20:21.980 --> 20:26.020]  family warm the standard answers are firewood coal or propane but the problem
[20:26.020 --> 20:30.460]  with that if you need to be on the move is you can't take it with you another
[20:30.460 --> 20:34.380]  concern there may come a time when you need to stay warm without smoke like in
[20:34.380 --> 20:38.460]  times of war there may even come a time when you can't burn fuel the answers
[20:38.460 --> 20:43.400]  may be simpler and less costly than you think for these answers go to Fortress

[24:09.460 --> 24:16.500]  I wish your buck was still silver it was back. Welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm
[24:16.500 --> 24:22.540]  David Knight on this Friday October 23rd 2015 we are going to have the Alex
[24:22.540 --> 24:26.020]  Storming Google and Anthony Gutierrez was there he's going to tell us about
[24:26.020 --> 24:31.500]  that in the next segment and that's very important because we just had the Senate
[24:31.500 --> 24:39.060]  vote to move forward the cyberspace internet sharing act that is CISA it
[24:39.060 --> 24:43.860]  was put to us many times as CISPO we had people like Aaron Schwartz saying this
[24:43.860 --> 24:48.900]  isn't a good idea of course he died opposing it I think that there was a
[24:48.900 --> 24:54.180]  very suspicious circumstances there nobody in his family or his fiancee
[24:54.180 --> 24:58.140]  believed that he was suicidal they said that he was looking at a long jail
[24:58.140 --> 25:03.460]  sentence and he just couldn't handle it nevertheless he had turned down some
[25:03.460 --> 25:07.620]  very minor penalties that were put out there for plea bargaining by the
[25:07.620 --> 25:13.380]  prosecutor just before he quote-unquote committed suicide but now after many
[25:13.380 --> 25:17.700]  tries they're putting CISA forward we have an article on info wars.com these
[25:17.700 --> 25:23.740]  83 senators voted to expand surveillance in a very underhanded devious way as a
[25:23.740 --> 25:26.900]  matter of fact we'll explain how it'll work who are some of the senators that
[25:26.900 --> 25:29.940]  are running of course you can take a look at that article on info wars.com and
[25:29.940 --> 25:32.500]  see if your senator is on there but let's look at some of the people who are
[25:32.500 --> 25:37.500]  running for president how did they vote Ted Cruz voted to turn over the
[25:37.500 --> 25:40.940]  information turn over your information to the government and to give
[25:40.940 --> 25:46.100]  corporations liability protection for doing that we also had Graham and Rubio
[25:46.100 --> 25:49.100]  which have supported this in the past they did not vote but we know
[25:49.100 --> 25:54.260]  precisely how they would have voted we had those voting against it senator Paul
[25:54.260 --> 26:01.100]  and senator Sanders voted against this only about 14 I believe because there
[26:01.100 --> 26:06.060]  were several that 83 voted for it there were several that were out that did not
[26:06.060 --> 26:11.180]  vote but of the 14 that voted against it senator Paul and senator Sanders voted
[26:11.180 --> 26:14.980]  against it running for president again you can see how your senator voted
[26:14.980 --> 26:18.700]  whether they voted to betray your privacy or not the interesting thing
[26:18.700 --> 26:23.620]  about this as well is that the companies who really stand to benefit from this in
[26:23.620 --> 26:28.260]  terms of liability standpoint companies like Apple Twitter Facebook Google have
[26:28.260 --> 26:32.420]  come out against the bill in recent days now some of them I think really do
[26:32.420 --> 26:37.980]  oppose it but many of them do not many of them are coming out simply because they
[26:37.980 --> 26:42.860]  want to win the confidence of their customers back people don't trust these
[26:42.860 --> 26:47.180]  companies that are collecting all this information on us and then freely turning
[26:47.180 --> 26:52.100]  it over to the government who can label us as extremist and do things as I
[26:52.100 --> 26:56.300]  mentioned in the last segment like take away your children take away your
[26:56.300 --> 26:59.660]  children because your political views don't tell me that they're not going to
[26:59.660 --> 27:02.940]  do that that's what they've been working on for a very long time
[27:02.940 --> 27:08.780]  geospatial intelligence human domain analytics activity based intelligence
[27:08.780 --> 27:11.940]  all of this information that they're collecting on you they're breaking you
[27:11.940 --> 27:16.020]  down they're mapping you down to the individual level they used to do it
[27:16.020 --> 27:20.100]  regionally then they used to now they're down to the individual because they have
[27:20.100 --> 27:24.540]  that kind of technology so they map out where you are physically but they also
[27:24.540 --> 27:28.500]  map out where you are politically religiously and in any other way that
[27:28.500 --> 27:31.900]  they may be interested in looking at you and then what they do is they put this
[27:31.900 --> 27:38.460]  into their algorithm to see if maybe you pop up can you understand how dangerous
[27:38.460 --> 27:43.140]  that is when you've got a computer program pointing the finger at you and
[27:43.140 --> 27:46.820]  what's the logical conclusion after that well the logical conclusion is you
[27:46.820 --> 27:51.100]  get a SWAT team raid perhaps at your house perhaps if you're startled by it
[27:51.100 --> 27:55.380]  and you make some move that someone on the SWAT team who has heavily covered
[27:55.380 --> 27:59.820]  in body armor takes that as a threat to their personal safety then they feel
[27:59.820 --> 28:04.580]  entitled and they're increasingly being held legally entitled to shoot and kill
[28:04.580 --> 28:09.580]  you that's where we're headed with this that's the kind of insane world that
[28:09.580 --> 28:14.220]  we're looking at this is very much like Terry Gilliam's Brazil where this guy's
[28:14.220 --> 28:19.140]  name pops up because mistakenly it goes from buttold to tuttle because a fly
[28:19.140 --> 28:23.220]  drops down into the printer and changes the way that it prints out they raid
[28:23.220 --> 28:27.500]  the wrong person and they take him away and he's ultimately killed that's the
[28:27.500 --> 28:32.180]  way we are headed with this and that's the problem with corporations who
[28:32.180 --> 28:35.780]  collect your information and then turn this over that has been the basis of
[28:35.780 --> 28:39.940]  most of the illegal surveillance in the United States the idea that this
[28:39.940 --> 28:43.020]  information that is collected by the phone company or by the internet
[28:43.020 --> 28:46.700]  companies doesn't belong to you it belongs to them and they don't need a
[28:46.700 --> 28:50.180]  search warrant to turn it over to the government they just the government ask
[28:50.180 --> 28:54.700]  the corporations and the corporations say well sure here it is because I don't
[28:54.700 --> 28:58.860]  want to lose my telephone monopoly or I don't want to have any problems with the
[28:58.860 --> 29:03.740]  government just to protect this person over here so they don't have to get a
[29:03.740 --> 29:07.860]  search warrant they're constantly looking for ways that they can go around the
[29:07.860 --> 29:12.580]  Constitution go around your due process rights and this is just one more of
[29:12.580 --> 29:17.900]  those just like civil asset forfeiture stealing your property not charging you
[29:17.900 --> 29:23.660]  with a crime not finding you guilty but taking your property and saying hey it's
[29:23.660 --> 29:27.180]  a civil action so you don't get the presumption of innocence you don't have
[29:27.180 --> 29:29.940]  to have a court trial we don't have to find you guilty we just take your
[29:29.940 --> 29:33.740]  property and you can try to get it back if you want but you'll have to sue us in
[29:33.740 --> 29:37.180]  civil court you'll have to hire a lawyer to do it that's the kind of
[29:37.180 --> 29:41.740]  perversion of the Constitution that these 83 senators have just signed on to
[29:41.740 --> 29:45.380]  and they've been fine with civil asset forfeiture as well for decades stay with
[29:45.380 --> 29:50.580]  us when we come back Alex Storms Google we're on the March the Empire's on the
[29:50.580 --> 30:00.260]  run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network after the release of numerous
[30:00.260 --> 30:04.500]  videos showing questionable Planned Parenthood practices multiple facilities
[30:04.500 --> 30:08.820]  have been raided Reuters reports Texas officials rated several Planned
[30:08.820 --> 30:12.780]  Parenthood facilities on Thursday and a move that comes days after the state
[30:12.780 --> 30:16.860]  Republican leaders bar the women's health group from receiving state Medicaid
[30:16.860 --> 30:21.140]  money the inspector general's office declined to comment but its agents were
[30:21.140 --> 30:24.900]  seen on local news reports entering a Planned Parenthood facility in San
[30:24.900 --> 30:29.220]  Antonio Texas said it would launch a probe of Planned Parenthood after the
[30:29.220 --> 30:33.300]  release of videos in July by anti-abortion activist group Center for
[30:33.300 --> 30:37.100]  Medical Progress in which a Planned Parenthood official is seen talking
[30:37.100 --> 30:41.620]  about transactions involving fetal tissue and speaking on a personal note
[30:41.620 --> 30:45.660]  Planned Parenthood continues to say that the videos were edited which they were
[30:45.660 --> 30:49.860]  much like you would edit a state of a union address down to a few sound bites
[30:49.860 --> 30:53.780]  but that doesn't mean that they were taken out of context you can find more

[33:11.860 --> 33:19.260]  wars dot com frontline report it's Alex Jones welcome back to the Alex Jones
[33:19.260 --> 33:23.500]  show I'm David Knight and joining me in this segment is Anthony Gucci Artie he
[33:23.500 --> 33:26.820]  was a I guess we could call you a co-conspirator with Alex
[33:26.820 --> 33:31.460]  Storming Google I haven't seen this video I'm anxious to see it as a brilliant
[33:31.460 --> 33:36.460]  idea it's exactly what we need to do we need to get in their face and we need to
[33:36.460 --> 33:40.860]  illustrate the double standard the incredible double standard and this is
[33:40.860 --> 33:47.580]  coming just as we had the Senate vote to pass the cyber information sharing act
[33:47.580 --> 33:51.660]  this is something that is going to allow corporations to violate your
[33:51.660 --> 33:55.460]  privacy giving any information that they collect on you and of course they're
[33:55.460 --> 33:58.660]  collecting everything on you constantly companies like Facebook are
[33:58.660 --> 34:01.660]  collecting information on you even when you're not on their site they're going
[34:01.660 --> 34:05.060]  to now be able to turn that information over to the federal government without
[34:05.060 --> 34:10.660]  any liability issues from you you can't sue them when they violate your
[34:10.660 --> 34:14.860]  privacy so this is where we are and it was passed by the Senate the House has
[34:14.860 --> 34:18.460]  already passed an earlier version of this all they have to do at this point is
[34:18.460 --> 34:23.700]  reconcile these two versions and get Obama to sign it so folks it's a done
[34:23.700 --> 34:29.740]  deal people like Aaron Schwartz said he gave his life fighting this he repealed
[34:29.740 --> 34:34.660]  this multiple times but they are relentless they keep coming back time
[34:34.660 --> 34:40.060]  and time again repackaging it sometimes not even repackaging it I mean they had
[34:40.060 --> 34:43.860]  a minor change in the name and they got it through but it's still the same bill
[34:43.860 --> 34:47.140]  and of course the White House says the administration is committed to continue
[34:47.140 --> 34:52.660]  working with stakeholders to address remaining concerns that would be people
[34:52.660 --> 34:59.260]  like Google people like Facebook because you don't have a say anymore in your
[34:59.260 --> 35:03.180]  government the Constitution is not an issue they could care less what you
[35:03.180 --> 35:09.220]  think you're not a stakeholder just like you're not involved in the Trans-Pacific
[35:09.220 --> 35:12.100]  or Trans-Atlantic partnerships that they're creating you're not a
[35:12.100 --> 35:16.900]  stakeholder you don't have a stake in this country's future anymore it's just
[35:16.900 --> 35:20.420]  the corporations who work with the Republican and Democrat leadership to
[35:20.420 --> 35:25.860]  do whatever they want to to you their slave so Alex got right in their face
[35:25.860 --> 35:29.660]  and we're talking about it before we do real quickly we have a supermail
[35:29.660 --> 35:32.660]  vitality that is back in stock I want to let you know about the other specials
[35:32.660 --> 35:38.260]  we have 15% off of ancient defense 10% off of the complete info wars select

[35:49.100 --> 35:52.340]  supermail vitality is back it's been out of stock for a while let me read you a
[35:52.340 --> 35:55.700]  couple of reviews you can see the reviews for yourself on a site it's a
[35:55.700 --> 35:58.740]  good way to determine if the product is right for you here's a couple of the
[35:58.740 --> 36:04.580]  reviews Chris in Dallas Texas says fantastic product I bought it for more
[36:04.580 --> 36:08.620]  use at the more for use of the gym which I can see it increases my energy and
[36:08.620 --> 36:12.860]  strength results outside the gym and in better two thumbs up also it lifts
[36:12.860 --> 36:17.540]  moods and gives mental energy as well as physical another review here by Tom and
[36:17.540 --> 36:21.660]  Baton Rouge Louisiana says I was a couch potato I woke up I moved my family to a
[36:21.660 --> 36:25.300]  farm shortly after moving in I need to put up a fence found the ground to be
[36:25.300 --> 36:29.380]  solid clay on my fence line I was going to rent an auger for $150 instead I
[36:29.380 --> 36:35.380]  took supermail and using a manual post hole digger I dropped 26 inch posts three
[36:35.380 --> 36:39.700]  feet into the ground in less than three hours I feel like Superman well there
[36:39.700 --> 36:42.860]  you go that's a couple of reviews so you can take a look at this see what you
[36:42.860 --> 36:46.940]  think about the product again it is something that sells out very quickly
[36:46.940 --> 36:51.700]  it's now back in stock order yours today and get it before it sells out that
[36:51.700 --> 36:57.100]  supermail vitality well Anthony you went with Alex to go to Google and this is
[36:57.100 --> 37:01.620]  very important that people understand what is going on especially in light of
[37:01.620 --> 37:06.620]  syssa just passing it's very important for people understand that but Alex had
[37:06.620 --> 37:10.900]  a great brainstorm tell us how this this came up because this is classic Alex
[37:10.900 --> 37:14.020]  Jones well you have to think about first of all whether it's the new syspa
[37:14.020 --> 37:18.340]  adaptation or the TPP or the variations of syspa that were conceived years and
[37:18.340 --> 37:22.980]  years ago over and over again we see a complete attack on our ability to have
[37:22.980 --> 37:26.140]  any form of privacy and if you talked about it years ago if you talked about
[37:26.140 --> 37:30.860]  the idea that Google was indexing your search results for marketing material
[37:30.860 --> 37:33.740]  that Facebook was making most of its money selling marketing selling
[37:33.740 --> 37:36.660]  marketing material to third-party companies you would be called crazy you
[37:36.660 --> 37:39.780]  would be called a conspiracy theorist paranoid absolutely or if that apps
[37:39.780 --> 37:43.340]  were tracking things as they admit in the terms of service but now of course
[37:43.340 --> 37:48.100]  that is accepted it is accepted but the problem is we aren't actually raising
[37:48.100 --> 37:51.100]  more awareness over this issue and aren't fighting back and that's how things
[37:51.100 --> 37:55.380]  like the syssa CISA the syspa adaptation you were just talking about are being
[37:55.380 --> 37:59.980]  passed things like the dark act things like the TPP if we don't continue to
[37:59.980 --> 38:04.260]  raise the alarm and do something about it they will win at every turn and this
[38:04.260 --> 38:08.260]  is not I I'm I'm saying this is not a direct lead attack on Google it's attack
[38:08.260 --> 38:12.540]  on the idea that our privacy is being invaded by a number of conglomerate of
[38:12.540 --> 38:16.380]  companies and it's important to raise the alarm on that it's also important to
[38:16.380 --> 38:20.380]  start discussions about things like this article from the MIT technology review
[38:20.380 --> 38:26.340]  why self-driving cars must be programmed to kill and it talks about how ethically
[38:26.340 --> 38:30.860]  we have to be willing to kill ourselves with driverless vehicles in order to
[38:30.860 --> 38:35.500]  save others and of course it doesn't bring up the idea that perhaps you know
[38:35.500 --> 38:38.980]  someone is illegally running in the street or two people are illegally
[38:38.980 --> 38:41.860]  running in the street I guess we better run into the barrier and kill ourselves
[38:41.860 --> 38:45.220]  right it can't make those types of decisions for us but I'm not even
[38:45.220 --> 38:49.380]  against the technology driverless cars could present a powerful solution in
[38:49.380 --> 38:52.500]  the future in some ways if we were able to figure these things out but instead
[38:52.500 --> 38:56.740]  we're sitting around like human slugs not questioning anything downloading all
[38:56.740 --> 39:00.220]  the apps that track everything we do going on Facebook downloading all those
[39:00.220 --> 39:04.820]  plugins and doing everything on a daily basis with no regard for information
[39:04.820 --> 39:09.900]  being tracked and taken and the Google HQ down in Austin even says we're going
[39:09.900 --> 39:14.740]  to record you everything you do here will be recorded in video and audio yeah
[39:14.740 --> 39:18.100]  so Alex said hey I'm gonna go in and record you guys how do you like that
[39:18.100 --> 39:22.660]  that's amazing of course you're talking about self-driving cars yeah it would be
[39:22.660 --> 39:26.340]  great if you had the option to do that if you wanted to go on autopilot for a
[39:26.340 --> 39:30.140]  while they had the technology but it's a beard for a complete control of
[39:30.140 --> 39:33.220]  transportation and that's the way a lot of this stuff is I mean we're looking at
[39:33.220 --> 39:37.140]  corporations collecting our information I look at it and I think most people look
[39:37.140 --> 39:41.260]  at that and say okay fine they map out my preferences so that they can send me
[39:41.260 --> 39:44.940]  targeted ads and that's maybe a nuisance sometimes but I'm not really
[39:44.940 --> 39:49.460]  worried about it but it gets really sinister when they combine it with CISA
[39:49.460 --> 39:53.500]  and they pass that information on the government that then puts it into their
[39:53.500 --> 39:58.620]  algorithm to identify you as a threat what are their criteria are their errors
[39:58.620 --> 40:02.780]  in the program this is something that is very very dangerous for us just like
[40:02.780 --> 40:06.020]  we're talking about you know errors in a self-driving car there's gonna be errors
[40:06.020 --> 40:09.580]  in an algorithm that's going to be looking to see if people are terrorist
[40:09.580 --> 40:13.660]  or not so that's some the false positives the the potential for damage the
[40:13.660 --> 40:18.060]  potential for abuse by people who love political power this is what we need to
[40:18.060 --> 40:22.100]  be very much afraid of but Alex did a great job of going like I said it's
[40:22.100 --> 40:25.940]  classic Alex Jones get right in their face illustrate it by putting yourself
[40:25.940 --> 40:28.780]  there because we can talk about the absurdity of it but when you put yourself
[40:28.780 --> 40:33.620]  there in the physical situation that's when it really hits home let's watch
[40:33.620 --> 40:41.780]  that video here we go absolutely all we can't videotape in here don't worry
[40:41.780 --> 40:45.780]  we're already streaming a lot of you won't stop our transmission
[40:52.780 --> 40:58.420]  now a lot of times people ask me why do confrontational things I don't do as
[40:58.420 --> 41:02.420]  much as I used to it's because the globalists are confronting us they're
[41:02.420 --> 41:07.940]  getting in our face they're doing things to us and they're taking our data and
[41:07.940 --> 41:11.900]  it's time we just give them a little bit of the aggressiveness they give us to
[41:11.900 --> 41:17.300]  illustrate how what they do is hidden hand what they do is digital the real
[41:17.300 --> 41:21.780]  power in this world is still and we'll get even more powerful in the future
[41:21.780 --> 41:26.820]  physical as less people get physical as less people deal in third dimension and
[41:26.820 --> 41:29.900]  use their mind for fourth and fifth dimension thinking what we're doing
[41:29.900 --> 41:33.180]  right now is where it's all at let's go in
[41:33.180 --> 41:40.460]  hello ma'am Alex Jones how are you doing good go this was like an exciting
[41:40.460 --> 41:44.180]  event tonight how you doing Alex Jones info wars.com and her visiting our
[41:44.180 --> 41:49.540]  buddies at Google what are you guys about to do here tonight allow recording in
[41:49.540 --> 41:52.940]  here well but Google told me in an update that it uses the camera and
[41:52.940 --> 41:57.300]  microphone was to be in my house just one second I mean you don't allow
[41:57.300 --> 41:59.660]  recording in here but she got her camera right there on the computer that
[41:59.660 --> 42:04.980]  Google says it uses to watch people I'm a little confused by that I mean we got
[42:04.980 --> 42:07.940]  everybody getting roped in here and then we're just here with a camera I mean
[42:07.940 --> 42:13.700]  Google's got its cameras on all our computers we use Google watching us I
[42:13.700 --> 42:17.340]  mean just explain that to me how can he say we shouldn't have a camera in here
[42:17.340 --> 42:21.900]  when Google is all about selling our data and and interviews I'm sorry you
[42:21.900 --> 42:24.660]  just listen to us inside our houses without asking and try to take our cars
[42:24.660 --> 42:29.780]  over it is that all the lobby government to take our cars away anyway so we're
[42:29.780 --> 42:34.300]  just here with a camera Google has phones you know dialing in watching us
[42:34.300 --> 42:38.620]  listening to us I mean I'm really trying to figure this out let's go look at some
[42:38.620 --> 42:44.860]  of the food over here here we go absolutely all we can't videotape in
[42:44.860 --> 42:48.140]  here don't worry we're already streaming a live you won't stop our
[42:48.140 --> 42:53.260]  transmission anyways we're here inside Google invitation only Google doesn't
[42:53.260 --> 42:56.660]  tell you it's invitation only when they hack into your house and watch and track
[42:56.660 --> 43:02.340]  everything you're doing look we got lots of private event oh oh please don't
[43:02.340 --> 43:05.900]  touch our equipment I'm not gonna touch your Google well ma'am don't touch me
[43:05.900 --> 43:11.940]  please I don't want to well I need you to not touch me okay but isn't a
[43:11.940 --> 43:14.660]  private event it's Google watching and listening inside here I do not work for
[43:14.660 --> 43:19.820]  Google you shouldn't be touching me that's assault actually well I need a
[43:19.820 --> 43:24.220]  police officer to tell me that she need to go ahead and have them call good yeah
[43:24.220 --> 43:28.300]  do that go ahead so again Google trespasses on us tracks and listens
[43:28.300 --> 43:32.580]  everything we do we come here and what did I say the response would be we're
[43:32.580 --> 43:38.300]  polite we're nice and this is how Google ropes in all the whole community and
[43:38.300 --> 43:41.020]  gives a little free cheese and stuff like you do a mouse before it gets on the
[43:41.020 --> 43:45.900]  trap and slams the door shut but just like we've had all the NSA whistleblowers
[43:45.900 --> 43:50.780]  on we're gonna continue to expose the public front of the NSA come on let's
[43:50.780 --> 43:55.060]  go back outside now one of our latest additions to info war season introducing
[43:55.060 --> 43:59.300]  self now just pointed out some key humet or human intelligence when he was
[43:59.300 --> 44:03.580]  inside so we're gonna go back in and show everybody Michael Zimmerman when
[44:03.580 --> 44:06.580]  we were inside just now I noticed a sign on the window that says when you're in
[44:06.580 --> 44:09.980]  this building everything that goes on here is going to be recorded for this
[44:09.980 --> 44:13.460]  this event so you're on camera no matter where you are in the Google building
[44:13.460 --> 44:18.620]  and they'll they'll capture you on camera but they're mad at us come show us
[44:18.620 --> 44:22.020]  the sign exactly come show us a sign here we go around to the really upset
[44:22.020 --> 44:29.660]  now and just mr. Zimmerman please point this out to us ma'am we are back we
[44:29.660 --> 44:34.260]  appreciate you real quick I was here to see the sign this says that everybody's
[44:34.260 --> 44:39.260]  being filmed in here by Google just like they feel me inside your house so what
[44:39.260 --> 44:42.860]  would the issue be with us in here filming nothing against your event ma'am
[44:42.860 --> 44:48.260]  sorry the Google spider has caught you but notice of the public film and
[44:48.260 --> 44:51.580]  videotape is presently being shot in this location all areas in this event are
[44:51.580 --> 44:55.220]  likely to be filmed for the least part of the evisceration now that's that's
[44:55.220 --> 44:59.060]  from Google ladies and gentlemen so so that's what goes on thank you Google
[44:59.060 --> 45:04.660]  fiber see it on info wars dot com and on the Google platform YouTube because we
[45:04.660 --> 45:10.860]  use the enemy's platforms against them thank you Eric Schmidt is Google CEO if
[45:10.860 --> 45:14.180]  you have something that you don't want anyone to know maybe you shouldn't be
[45:14.180 --> 45:18.020]  doing it in the first place there's what I call the creepy line I would argue
[45:18.020 --> 45:22.100]  that in planting things in your brain is a is beyond the creepy line I didn't
[45:22.100 --> 45:28.780]  take yes at least for the moment until the technology gets better we didn't ask
[45:28.780 --> 45:34.620]  for this it was Trojan horse not just with Google but into all the cars the
[45:34.620 --> 45:39.100]  other PC systems the Apple systems you name it they get together in these big
[45:39.100 --> 45:42.820]  giant corporate board meetings with governmental leaders this stuff's been
[45:42.820 --> 45:47.380]  declassified over the last 50 years this has been happening with DARPA and other
[45:47.380 --> 45:52.260]  agencies and they decide the future we've built this artificiality that has
[45:52.260 --> 45:59.660]  so many positive angles to it but overall the screen time the television
[45:59.660 --> 46:05.780]  watching lowering our IQ causing brain damage this is not debatable and so while
[46:05.780 --> 46:09.060]  they were building the Trojan horse while they were putting their grid in
[46:09.060 --> 46:12.940]  place which is now basically in place for this AI takeover and that's in
[46:12.940 --> 46:17.820]  Google's own words founded 16 years ago they met and said listen we're not just
[46:17.820 --> 46:21.300]  building a search engine we're not just working with DARPA and in to tell the CIA
[46:21.300 --> 46:26.260]  this is like in wire magazine now that I was told this by NSA insiders like 14
[46:26.260 --> 46:30.420]  years ago now it's in the news oh we set out to build an artificially
[46:30.420 --> 46:35.100]  intelligent system that interfaces with billions of humans in lifetime and that
[46:35.100 --> 46:40.900]  basically humans are now nodes or eyeballs or or robot droids or drones of
[46:40.900 --> 46:46.460]  Google when Google is allowed to get past laws other people can't Google has
[46:46.460 --> 46:50.380]  this government relationship with NASA you name it nobody else has because it
[46:50.380 --> 46:54.980]  is really a governmental institution and I don't want to single Google out
[46:54.980 --> 47:00.260]  Google compared to like Apple which is even bigger and some of these other
[47:00.260 --> 47:04.940]  globalist corporations is actually our nice guys compared and I don't just say
[47:04.940 --> 47:07.740]  that because you know I don't want to mess with Google that's just the truth
[47:07.740 --> 47:12.500]  that they understand keep the web free keep it somewhat open while they grow
[47:12.500 --> 47:19.220]  to get their data to be able to become a sentient AI system and many scientists
[47:19.220 --> 47:22.580]  believe and we'll put the articles up here on screen that Google has already
[47:22.580 --> 47:28.260]  actually become sentient and has transcended IBM and it's deep blue and
[47:28.260 --> 47:31.500]  it's other systems take your destiny in your hands and don't let these people
[47:31.500 --> 47:35.940]  control your future and dominate who you are discover what's really happening
[47:35.940 --> 47:40.620]  and realize that everything you do the energy you expend is being sucked off
[47:40.620 --> 47:45.020]  by these people to build their their castle in the clouds to build their
[47:45.020 --> 47:48.700]  world and you're not supposed to have any part of that that's a load of crap
[47:48.700 --> 47:52.460]  we're going to expose what's happening and we're going to buy our actions
[47:52.460 --> 47:56.540]  change what these groups are doing we're gonna reach out to the executives of
[47:56.540 --> 47:59.500]  these companies we're gonna reach out to their children their wives their
[47:59.500 --> 48:03.860]  husbands we're going to lay out an alternative to this program that's
[48:03.860 --> 48:08.220]  based on free will and I assure you if you take action and get involved in
[48:08.220 --> 48:12.460]  that discussion and creating that reality these systems will fall they're
[48:12.460 --> 48:16.660]  scared of you and they know once humanity is unchained they're not gonna
[48:16.660 --> 48:19.500]  be able to have their control of the future and play God and that's what
[48:19.500 --> 48:23.860]  they're scared of but this fight's been played out in this universe many times
[48:23.860 --> 48:29.300]  believe that and 999 times out of a thousand they failed and that's why
[48:29.300 --> 48:32.980]  they're so scared they've gotten better at what they do but in the end they
[48:32.980 --> 48:37.580]  will fall is the street okay we're welcome inside well thank you you're

[49:59.540 --> 50:04.380]  resistance and I'm David Knight here in the studio with Anthony Gutiarty you
[50:04.380 --> 50:08.260]  were with Alex what was that like at Anthony you know everyone's allowed to
[50:08.260 --> 50:12.100]  track us and tell us what we can and can't do and if you're doing something
[50:12.100 --> 50:14.660]  wrong then you shouldn't be doing it in the first place we're allowed to track
[50:14.660 --> 50:17.100]  that we're allowed to look at your search results we're like to look at
[50:17.100 --> 50:21.100]  everything you do yeah we can't go in and film something yeah it's a silly
[50:21.100 --> 50:25.140]  little stunt but it's demonstrating a higher point which is that we are being
[50:25.140 --> 50:29.060]  looked at we're being targeted by big big brother operations CISPA like bills
[50:29.060 --> 50:33.820]  passing every single day the TPP but if we do anything oh yeah fight back in
[50:33.820 --> 50:37.300]  any way we're crazy it's people are even afraid to talk to other human beings on
[50:37.300 --> 50:40.340]  the street these days it's funny to see the reaction of the Google employees
[50:40.340 --> 50:43.620]  when Alex stuck a camera mic in their face it's kind of like when Tom Mabe did
[50:43.620 --> 50:46.420]  that with a boom mic they don't want to think about the fact they're being
[50:46.420 --> 50:50.740]  followed we'll be right back I'm gonna cover what actually happened with CISPA
[50:50.740 --> 50:53.820]  as well as what happened in Iceland stay with us we'll be right back thank

[53:01.380 --> 53:05.740]  largest private news and research network in the world and I paid for this
[53:05.740 --> 53:10.540]  airtime because I have an important message to the American people there's
[53:10.540 --> 53:16.100]  a change coming that the government isn't telling you about this change has
[53:16.100 --> 53:21.420]  deep implications for life in America from where you shop to the doctors you
[53:21.420 --> 53:26.220]  visit and the family you want to protect look I've made predictions like this
[53:26.220 --> 53:32.780]  before thing is I was right then too a few years ago I warned that housing
[53:32.780 --> 53:39.260]  prices would collapse they did before that I warned that dot-com companies
[53:39.260 --> 53:45.940]  would crash they did those who listened had a chance to save themselves but this
[53:45.940 --> 53:49.980]  has nothing to do with the stock market this will affect us all you can watch
[53:49.980 --> 53:55.460]  the video for free right now by going to dollardanger.com again that's
[53:55.460 --> 54:08.980]  dollardanger.com
[54:08.980 --> 54:12.980]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight your host on this Friday
[54:12.980 --> 54:19.220]  October 23rd 2015 of course we just saw the video where Alex Jones and he was
[54:19.220 --> 54:23.340]  accompanied by Anthony Gutiarty went to the Google headquarters and stuck a
[54:23.340 --> 54:27.060]  microphone in their face with a camera and you could see the employees pulling
[54:27.060 --> 54:30.580]  back very uncomfortable that I'm not going to say anything that's the reaction
[54:30.580 --> 54:35.860]  you always get from people when you do this and of course we've shown the the
[54:35.860 --> 54:40.020]  prank that comedian Tom Maeve did we actually talked to him about this prank
[54:40.020 --> 54:45.420]  where he dressed up in typical Secret Service attire puts on sunglasses he
[54:45.420 --> 54:50.180]  puts on like a men-in-black suit you know but he's carrying a boom mic and
[54:50.180 --> 54:54.300]  headphones and people are having private conversations setting in the park
[54:54.300 --> 54:58.380]  setting on a bench or whatever standing on sidewalks and he walks up to them you
[54:58.380 --> 55:01.580]  can see that right there he walks up to them as this guy's talking on the phone
[55:01.580 --> 55:05.900]  and he sticks this microphone in their face like get out of here what are you
[55:05.900 --> 55:10.300]  doing this guy's running and Tom Maeve is chasing him down the street as he's
[55:10.300 --> 55:14.940]  talking on the phone you don't realize however when the government is doing it
[55:14.940 --> 55:21.220]  with your device just as Alex went into Google and puts the camera and the
[55:21.220 --> 55:25.220]  microphone in the guy's face the guy has got a laptop in front of him now of
[55:25.220 --> 55:28.700]  course that laptop has got a camera and a microphone in it but he doesn't think
[55:28.700 --> 55:33.540]  about it because it's in a laptop so it's just fine just fine he doesn't think
[55:33.540 --> 55:37.500]  about that at all and of course his employer as well as Facebook and other
[55:37.500 --> 55:41.020]  sites that he goes to all the time they can grab that information and they can
[55:41.020 --> 55:44.780]  pass it on to the government and the government can use that information any
[55:44.780 --> 55:49.100]  way they want to they can misconstrue it they they can blackmail you with it
[55:49.100 --> 55:54.540]  they can imply that you're something that you're not that's the danger of all
[55:54.540 --> 55:59.420]  of this people need to go back and ask themselves why we required search
[55:59.420 --> 56:03.140]  warrants from the government people need to ask themselves why we had
[56:03.140 --> 56:08.460]  privacy why we had private property maybe these are concepts we shouldn't
[56:08.460 --> 56:13.460]  throw under the bus maybe we ought to understand how they still apply even
[56:13.460 --> 56:17.620]  though we have different technology we have to understand that just because of
[56:17.620 --> 56:23.220]  technology changes human nature doesn't change private property and the idea
[56:23.220 --> 56:28.060]  that you would have search warrants were there to protect us from the evil human
[56:28.060 --> 56:32.220]  nature that is in everyone that gets brought out when there's no constraints
[56:32.220 --> 56:36.580]  on their power that's why we have it there and the problem is human nature
[56:36.580 --> 56:42.220]  hasn't stopped human nature hasn't changed because we have got this these
[56:42.220 --> 56:46.340]  these new devices it doesn't mean that it's all over then everything is fine
[56:46.340 --> 56:51.700]  somehow these phones changed our government for the better no the power
[56:51.700 --> 56:56.260]  that they present to the government has changed the government for the worse
[56:56.260 --> 57:02.540]  power always consolidates power corrupts and this is a lot more power in the
[57:02.540 --> 57:08.140]  hands of very few people and it is making them worse we need these protections
[57:08.140 --> 57:12.500]  like search warrants like privacy like private property we need these now more
[57:12.500 --> 57:18.260]  than ever more than ever the technology is threatening us in a way that has
[57:18.260 --> 57:22.380]  never been threatening before and these things that we are now jettisoning and
[57:22.380 --> 57:26.780]  and saying we don't need them because we have this new technology because
[57:26.780 --> 57:31.020]  everything has changed no we need it even more that's the sad thing about it and
[57:31.020 --> 57:36.260]  again if you want to know who just betrayed your privacy the 83 senators
[57:36.260 --> 57:41.460]  who dead people who are running for president people like Ted Cruz and we
[57:41.460 --> 57:46.500]  know that Marco Rubio and and Lindsey Graham are completely on board with this
[57:46.500 --> 57:51.460]  type of invasion of your privacy CISA they have spoken in favor of it they
[57:51.460 --> 57:54.500]  did not vote for it because they didn't they weren't there they didn't vote at
[57:54.500 --> 57:58.820]  all the only two presidential candidates who voted against this or Rand Paul and
[57:58.820 --> 58:03.820]  Bernie Sanders and I have issues of Bernie Sanders for certain I don't agree
[58:03.820 --> 58:07.780]  with everything that Rand Paul does either we have to support people issue by
[58:07.780 --> 58:12.140]  issue and we have to say when they do the right thing at a boy you did the
[58:12.140 --> 58:17.300]  right thing and we have to hold these other 83 senators feet to the fire
[58:17.300 --> 58:21.160]  because this is now a done deal you're not a stakeholder they're gonna ram this
[58:21.160 --> 58:23.980]  thing through when we come back and of course in the fourth hour we're gonna be
[58:23.980 --> 58:27.420]  talking to Abby Johnson we come back we're gonna talk about what's up with
[58:27.420 --> 58:31.580]  the Planned Parenthood video leak this latest one came out of the House
[58:31.580 --> 58:36.140]  Committee and Planned Parenthood is very upset about a raw video I thought they

[01:00:31.300 --> 01:00:36.300]  presidential race some interesting revelations we have an incredibly
[01:00:36.300 --> 01:00:42.620]  interesting article about who jeb bush has his favorite comic book characters
[01:00:42.620 --> 01:00:47.020]  I mean don't you want to know the comic book characters that jeb bush likes
[01:00:47.020 --> 01:00:52.500]  we're going to talk about the low level that this has sunk to but we're also
[01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:55.780]  going to talk about what happened with Benghazi yesterday we're going to talk
[01:00:55.780 --> 01:00:59.660]  about what's going on with planned parenthood investigation we have abbey
[01:00:59.660 --> 01:01:04.700]  johnson a former planned parenthood employee actually she was a manager at
[01:01:04.700 --> 01:01:08.300]  one of the planned parenthoods became a whistleblower she's going to be with us
[01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:11.900]  in the fourth hour and there's an interesting revelation that came out
[01:01:11.900 --> 01:01:16.420]  today in the House committee that is investigating the planned parenthood
[01:01:16.420 --> 01:01:21.300]  videos that were done by the undercover investigation that was done by the
[01:01:21.300 --> 01:01:25.340]  center for medical progress and of course the line of defense that planned
[01:01:25.340 --> 01:01:31.940]  parenthood came back with was these are deceptively edited videos so the house
[01:01:31.940 --> 01:01:36.420]  it was investigating what appeared to be very clearly if you watch the videos
[01:01:36.420 --> 01:01:41.860]  it certainly they were skirting the law in terms of partial birth abortion they
[01:01:41.860 --> 01:01:47.540]  were skirting the law in terms of soliciting body parts and procuring
[01:01:47.540 --> 01:01:52.260]  body parts for the for stem cell express and other companies like that so
[01:01:52.260 --> 01:01:54.900]  that appeared to be what was in the videos but they said no no no they
[01:01:54.900 --> 01:01:59.060]  deceptively edited so the house committee that is investigating this said
[01:01:59.060 --> 01:02:03.700]  well give us the raw footage so they gave the raw footage to the house and
[01:02:03.700 --> 01:02:09.020]  then an abortion group said oh wait a minute you don't release that raw
[01:02:09.020 --> 01:02:12.860]  footage why would they not want to release the raw footage I thought it
[01:02:12.860 --> 01:02:17.820]  was deceptively edited I thought it was just a hoax the raw footage should
[01:02:17.820 --> 01:02:22.660]  exonerate Planned Parenthood if that was true but they were very adamant not to
[01:02:22.660 --> 01:02:27.300]  let that go out now we learn from Politico that complete raw footage from
[01:02:27.300 --> 01:02:31.980]  the Planned Parenthood video surfaced Thursday on a conservative website got
[01:02:31.980 --> 01:02:36.900]  news whose editor said he'd gotten it from a house staffer despite lawmakers
[01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:41.060]  pledge to keep it confidential editor Charles Johnson released the full foot
[01:02:41.060 --> 01:02:46.140]  footage on Thursday after the National Abortion Federation got a temporary
[01:02:46.140 --> 01:02:49.940]  restraining order a day earlier prohibiting any dissemination Johnson
[01:02:49.940 --> 01:02:54.500]  said he would quote contest any unconstitutional prior restraint of
[01:02:54.500 --> 01:03:00.300]  speech good for him now they point out that the also that the person who is
[01:03:00.300 --> 01:03:06.100]  chairing this is Jason Chafetz who at one point was in the race for house
[01:03:06.100 --> 01:03:10.700]  speaker to replace John Boehner and quite frankly I don't even know what's
[01:03:10.700 --> 01:03:14.580]  going on with that would like to get somebody to talk to us about that this
[01:03:14.580 --> 01:03:19.140]  in the Congress that send the conservative caucus there to tell us what's
[01:03:19.140 --> 01:03:22.180]  going on because we have this motion that was put on the floor to vacate the
[01:03:22.180 --> 01:03:26.860]  chair nothing was ever done about that that was before recess Boehner didn't
[01:03:26.860 --> 01:03:32.020]  have the vote so he came back and after he checked off his bucket list item of
[01:03:32.020 --> 01:03:35.740]  meeting the Pope he knew that he was on the bucket list as far as being a house
[01:03:35.740 --> 01:03:38.740]  speaker goes because he didn't have the votes to stay in there to defeat that
[01:03:38.740 --> 01:03:42.900]  motion he said he was going to resign they had multiple candidates that came
[01:03:42.900 --> 01:03:47.980]  up but when John Boehner's candidate number two Kevin McCarthy stood up at
[01:03:47.980 --> 01:03:51.060]  the meeting where they were going to hold the vote stood up and said I'm
[01:03:51.060 --> 01:03:55.300]  withdrawing from the candidacy John Boehner just stopped the election isn't
[01:03:55.300 --> 01:03:59.420]  that interesting isn't it great to be the king isn't it great to be the
[01:03:59.420 --> 01:04:04.340]  dictator isn't it great to say hey my candidate just bowed out so we're gonna
[01:04:04.340 --> 01:04:08.300]  just stop the election we got two other candidates here but the guy that I like
[01:04:08.300 --> 01:04:14.020]  is not there so we're going to just stop this well anyway they're now saying
[01:04:14.020 --> 01:04:19.140]  that they're going to investigate and see who leaked the information but I think
[01:04:19.140 --> 01:04:24.420]  it's very fascinating that this is raw footage that again Planned Parenthood
[01:04:24.420 --> 01:04:29.660]  and the abortionists don't want this raw footage to get out either they put in
[01:04:29.660 --> 01:04:33.940]  injunctions to try to keep the edited footage from being in there I think if
[01:04:33.940 --> 01:04:38.140]  you look at this footage it's not that heavily edited you can see what's going
[01:04:38.140 --> 01:04:42.220]  on it is very clear I think the people many people I've seen Jesse Ventura say
[01:04:42.220 --> 01:04:46.100]  ah that's a bunch of garbage but then he admitted that he hadn't seen the tapes
[01:04:46.100 --> 01:04:51.180]  in Louisiana Bobby Jindal actually said to the people who are protesting their
[01:04:51.180 --> 01:04:54.460]  cuts on Planned Parenthood he said he set up a screen to show it to the
[01:04:54.460 --> 01:04:59.820]  protesters because they don't look stay with us we'll be right back less than a
[01:04:59.820 --> 01:05:03.580]  week after the overnight upgrade to Tesla cars making them capable of
[01:05:03.580 --> 01:05:07.660]  autonomous driving multiple videos have surfaced of the cars trying to throw
[01:05:07.660 --> 01:05:12.300]  their human drivers under the bus literally in one video the car begins
[01:05:12.300 --> 01:05:16.380]  beeping as another car approaches then rapidly swerves into what would have been
[01:05:16.380 --> 01:05:20.420]  a head-on collision if the driver hadn't reacted quickly to jerk the wheel back
[01:05:20.420 --> 01:05:25.820]  to the right Tesla says auto-steers just a beta release if you use it and your
[01:05:25.820 --> 01:05:30.660]  car crashes they deny all responsibility releasing buggy software that causes
[01:05:30.660 --> 01:05:34.580]  your computer to crash is far different than releasing buggy software that can
[01:05:34.580 --> 01:05:39.220]  crash your car with you in it and kill other people on the highway and ask
[01:05:39.220 --> 01:05:43.540]  yourself why would the government that normally is fanatic about safety allow
[01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:48.860]  this on the road because nothing is more important for them than to get
[01:05:48.860 --> 01:05:52.860]  control of your transportation even if it means a few of us will be smashed

[01:08:21.260 --> 01:08:25.100]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight on this Friday October 23rd
[01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:29.820]  2015 one of the things that we have to be concerned about of course and
[01:08:29.820 --> 01:08:34.460]  technology is always a two-edged sword and there's good aspects to it there's
[01:08:34.460 --> 01:08:40.460]  bad aspects to it I would be not opposed to self-driving cars and principle I am
[01:08:40.460 --> 01:08:45.580]  opposed however when the CEO of Uber says that he's going to use it to end
[01:08:45.580 --> 01:08:51.980]  car ownership because I know that Uber is getting a pass getting a double standard
[01:08:51.980 --> 01:08:56.260]  treatment that is highly favorable compared to what traditional taxi
[01:08:56.260 --> 01:09:00.580]  companies have been receiving in terms of government regulation in terms of
[01:09:00.580 --> 01:09:04.300]  taxation in terms of what they have to pay for a taxi medallion you understand
[01:09:04.300 --> 01:09:10.980]  as we shot that report talking to a taxi drivers in Washington DC in New York you
[01:09:10.980 --> 01:09:15.540]  have to pay half million dollars for a taxi medallion Uber drivers aren't paying
[01:09:15.540 --> 01:09:19.860]  that the Uber drivers are not having to get their cars inspected every six
[01:09:19.860 --> 01:09:25.620]  months they don't have a special enforcement arm of the police that is
[01:09:25.620 --> 01:09:31.140]  focused simply on taxi drivers that will basically give them massive fines if
[01:09:31.140 --> 01:09:34.980]  their cars even dirty that's what we're told in Washington DC that's what the
[01:09:34.980 --> 01:09:40.500]  taxi driver told us I'm all for a free market but what we have here is crony
[01:09:40.500 --> 01:09:44.360]  capitalism you had companies that were called
[01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:48.860]  jitney taxi companies that were tried once upon a time these were minority
[01:09:48.860 --> 01:09:54.260]  owned taxi companies the professional taxi companies the unionized taxi
[01:09:54.260 --> 01:09:57.860]  companies whatever you want to call them the established taxi companies that
[01:09:57.860 --> 01:10:01.180]  had the business licenses would were reluctant to go into a lot of the
[01:10:01.180 --> 01:10:04.540]  minority communities because they thought it was too dangerous or the
[01:10:04.540 --> 01:10:08.340]  fairs are not lucrative enough and so people in minority communities who
[01:10:08.340 --> 01:10:13.020]  didn't have cars needed taxis so a lot of entrepreneurs in the minority
[01:10:13.020 --> 01:10:15.780]  community started what they called jitney taxi companies these were
[01:10:15.780 --> 01:10:20.700]  unlicensed they didn't have all of the regulation that the regular taxi
[01:10:20.700 --> 01:10:26.020]  companies did and they cracked down on them very hard because you see the
[01:10:26.020 --> 01:10:30.260]  government wanted to create this symbiotic relationship with the highly
[01:10:30.260 --> 01:10:34.380]  regulated taxi companies with the unions and so forth and so on to control it to
[01:10:34.380 --> 01:10:39.100]  get a large kickback so they didn't want a free market but now they're bending
[01:10:39.100 --> 01:10:45.340]  out of the way to establish a free market for uber giving them essentially a
[01:10:45.340 --> 01:10:49.820]  free market like they crack down on the jitney taxi companies why is that well
[01:10:49.820 --> 01:10:53.940]  because Travis Kalalnik and uber and these other companies but especially uber
[01:10:53.940 --> 01:10:59.140]  is set up with the government they are operating on the same page they want to
[01:10:59.140 --> 01:11:03.940]  get rid of private ownership of car and cars and they understand that uber is
[01:11:03.940 --> 01:11:09.140]  their way to do it and of course uber is going to get rid of that dude in the car
[01:11:09.140 --> 01:11:13.540]  with you that's what he said that's his words exactly says once I do that then
[01:11:13.540 --> 01:11:17.820]  my service is going to be incredibly cheap and I will make private ownership
[01:11:17.820 --> 01:11:22.180]  of cars go away they don't want you to have freedom of movement they want don't
[01:11:22.180 --> 01:11:25.900]  want you to have freedom of transportation they want to control and
[01:11:25.900 --> 01:11:30.580]  track your movements and they're going to do that even if you retain your
[01:11:30.580 --> 01:11:33.740]  ownership of your car they're going to do that with the equipment that they put
[01:11:33.740 --> 01:11:39.140]  in your car because they're going to require that your car talks to all these
[01:11:39.140 --> 01:11:45.140]  other cars we're only about a year to away from mandated talking cars and when
[01:11:45.140 --> 01:11:47.900]  I mean mandated talking cars they're going to be talking to each other it's
[01:11:47.900 --> 01:11:52.020]  called vehicle-to-vehicle communication and they're going to be communicating
[01:11:52.020 --> 01:11:55.260]  with each other they're going to be communicating to listening stations are
[01:11:55.260 --> 01:11:58.060]  going to be communicating to the government and to your insurance company
[01:11:58.060 --> 01:12:02.860]  to tell them how you're driving so they can increase the fines increase the
[01:12:02.860 --> 01:12:07.940]  insurance fees to you so they can basically price you out of a car and say
[01:12:07.940 --> 01:12:12.100]  you know it's you don't want any more of these fines do you we'll just get rid
[01:12:12.100 --> 01:12:15.940]  of your car and you can drive around in a Nuber taxi and then we will control all
[01:12:15.940 --> 01:12:19.660]  of your transportation so that's where this is going this is going to a
[01:12:19.660 --> 01:12:24.100]  control grid to track everything that you're doing so that's why I don't like
[01:12:24.100 --> 01:12:28.860]  the technology it isn't going to be presented as an option for you in the
[01:12:28.860 --> 01:12:34.100]  long term it is going to be presented as a way to push you out of your car to
[01:12:34.100 --> 01:12:38.460]  take away your freedom of movement I I'm part of the generation the Postal
[01:12:38.460 --> 01:12:45.060]  Award to generation that grew up seeing cars as the essence of individual
[01:12:45.060 --> 01:12:49.020]  freedom you know see the USA and your Chevrolet there's Dinah Shore singing
[01:12:49.020 --> 01:12:52.980]  that that's what I grew up with that's what we experienced the kind of freedom
[01:12:52.980 --> 01:12:56.420]  that comes from mobility the freedom to live in the suburbs or the country if we
[01:12:56.420 --> 01:13:01.860]  want to and commute into the city but of course the the environmentalists don't
[01:13:01.860 --> 01:13:04.820]  like that so you have to get rid of that you're gonna have to get rid of that
[01:13:04.820 --> 01:13:08.660]  car we don't like the suburbs we don't like urban sprawl we don't like all
[01:13:08.660 --> 01:13:11.580]  these other factors so we're going to take that choice away from you but we're
[01:13:11.580 --> 01:13:15.060]  going to do it in the name of something that is benevolent well it's not really
[01:13:15.060 --> 01:13:18.980]  that benevolent as you may have heard with the news breaks that we did well
[01:13:18.980 --> 01:13:22.860]  there's been some issues with the self-driving updates that were done by
[01:13:22.860 --> 01:13:26.340]  Tesla Tesla's the first one to actually put this out of course the equipment is
[01:13:26.340 --> 01:13:30.140]  being put in all the cars now they had all the equipment put in the subsystems
[01:13:30.140 --> 01:13:34.540]  tested forward-looking radar and that sort of thing into their car system so it
[01:13:34.540 --> 01:13:37.620]  was just a software update they did it about a week ago now we've already had
[01:13:37.620 --> 01:13:43.460]  multiple instances of people putting up on the internet places where this went
[01:13:43.460 --> 01:13:47.940]  crazy you can see that they're playing some b-roll right there of a Tesla car
[01:13:47.940 --> 01:13:52.300]  trying to the other guy as he's going along there if you hear the audio it's
[01:13:52.300 --> 01:13:56.500]  going beep beep beep beep beep and the car is coming towards him and the car jerks
[01:13:56.500 --> 01:14:00.700]  the wheel into the path of the oncoming car but he grabs it and pulls it back
[01:14:00.700 --> 01:14:05.500]  yeah let's play the audio on that so people can hear that on the radio go
[01:14:05.500 --> 01:14:15.180]  ahead this is great great technology he's driving along enjoying this
[01:14:15.180 --> 01:14:22.180]  technology that's that's a that's a reporter and isn't that great now
[01:14:22.180 --> 01:14:26.540]  that's not the guy that just had the car try to throw him and the path of the
[01:14:26.540 --> 01:14:30.820]  oncoming vehicle but as they point on Tesla comes back and says the latest
[01:14:30.820 --> 01:14:34.340]  autopilot release is a hands-on experience to give drivers more
[01:14:34.340 --> 01:14:38.100]  confidence behind the wheel to increase their safety on the road to make
[01:14:38.100 --> 01:14:42.780]  more to a driving more enjoyable now look at this I got are you kidding me
[01:14:42.780 --> 01:14:47.700]  are the people driving these 70,000 to a hundred thousand dollar automobiles are
[01:14:47.700 --> 01:14:52.940]  these student drivers do they need more hands-on experience to drive down the
[01:14:52.940 --> 01:14:57.300]  road and the highway come on that is the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen
[01:14:57.300 --> 01:15:01.900]  the other thing that's ridiculous about this is that Tesla says that this is a
[01:15:01.900 --> 01:15:06.100]  beta release and use it at your own risk and if you have an accident you're
[01:15:06.100 --> 01:15:10.900]  responsible not us let me tell you something beta releases for software are
[01:15:10.900 --> 01:15:14.900]  one thing where you crash and lose your data but you know this is we're talking
[01:15:14.900 --> 01:15:18.580]  about people's lives here being at stake I think they're going to have some
[01:15:18.580 --> 01:15:23.180]  criminal liability if they crash this thing but just as Anthony Gucci already
[01:15:23.180 --> 01:15:27.020]  pointed out earlier there's this MIT technology review of talking yet again
[01:15:27.020 --> 01:15:32.100]  and this just came out yesterday why self-driving cars must be programmed to
[01:15:32.100 --> 01:15:37.500]  kill yeah we need to solve an impossible ethical dilemma of algorithmic
[01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:44.860]  morality algorithmic morality computer morality we have abdicated so many
[01:15:44.860 --> 01:15:51.420]  things to computers now why not abdicate our morality our choice and see that's
[01:15:51.420 --> 01:15:56.820]  goes back to what we're talking about in the first hour about CISA just passed
[01:15:56.820 --> 01:16:01.180]  in the Senate is already passed in the house and of course Obama is going to
[01:16:01.180 --> 01:16:05.380]  sign it when they turn that information over to the government you're going to
[01:16:05.380 --> 01:16:10.900]  have an algorithm that is going to flag you as a terrorist send out a SWAT team
[01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:16.900]  possibly start a prosecution of you you're returning everything over to our
[01:16:16.900 --> 01:16:22.420]  computers to the government and we don't have any freedom that we're restraining
[01:16:22.420 --> 01:16:26.500]  for ourselves but of course everybody in the tech business is cheering this on
[01:16:26.500 --> 01:16:31.460]  look at the way Wired magazine puts this out their headline obviously drivers
[01:16:31.460 --> 01:16:37.700]  are already abusing Tesla's autopilot so you see it's it's not that it's a bad
[01:16:37.700 --> 01:16:43.140]  idea it's not that you shouldn't be beta testing stuff on the streets with human
[01:16:43.140 --> 01:16:48.260]  drivers no it's the drivers who are abusing the software program poor
[01:16:48.260 --> 01:16:52.940]  software program poor Tesla isn't that a shame and of course one of these people
[01:16:52.940 --> 01:16:58.980]  in Miami took a video he says that his auto self-driving car was driving 75 in
[01:16:58.980 --> 01:17:02.740]  a 60 mile an hour zone and he was pulled over by the Florida Highway Patrol and he
[01:17:02.740 --> 01:17:06.020]  showed the speeding tickets that he got well they're going to be giving you
[01:17:06.020 --> 01:17:08.420]  speeding tickets all the time because they're going to have the black box
[01:17:08.420 --> 01:17:12.740]  recorders they're going to have the v2v communication and they're going to be
[01:17:12.740 --> 01:17:16.380]  passing that information on to the highway patrol of course they won't need
[01:17:16.380 --> 01:17:20.980]  highway patrol anymore but they're going to be passing that information on now I
[01:17:20.980 --> 01:17:28.020]  want to just go back and recall an older article that was out it was in 2015 it
[01:17:28.020 --> 01:17:33.740]  was earlier this year talking about researchers hacking the same model car
[01:17:33.740 --> 01:17:37.500]  but of course they said don't worry this is also a wide magazine don't worry
[01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:43.260]  Tesla's already patched that vulnerability well as long as you've got
[01:17:43.260 --> 01:17:46.700]  the capability of a computer driving your cars as long as you've got all these
[01:17:46.700 --> 01:17:50.260]  systems that were there and of course why did they do they they hacked a Tesla
[01:17:50.260 --> 01:17:55.540]  model s because it's got all the controls built in there so that you can
[01:17:55.540 --> 01:18:00.060]  drive the car as we just saw with their most recent update so you can get an
[01:18:00.060 --> 01:18:04.900]  update that makes the car a self-driving autonomous car or you can get an update
[01:18:04.900 --> 01:18:10.420]  from a hacker that drives you anywhere they want off the cliff and to the side
[01:18:10.420 --> 01:18:14.540]  of a mountain whatever you know when we talked about this with Michael Hastings
[01:18:14.540 --> 01:18:19.180]  everybody said you crazy conspiracy theorists nobody could or would do that
[01:18:19.180 --> 01:18:23.660]  well it's that wasn't that long ago that was only a couple of years ago that was
[01:18:23.660 --> 01:18:29.340]  2013 that Michael Hastings died and we said you know he was being investigated
[01:18:29.340 --> 01:18:32.620]  we didn't even know at the time it was it was ridiculous the way they were
[01:18:32.620 --> 01:18:37.060]  talking about how the engine had been ejected at a right angle when he crashed
[01:18:37.060 --> 01:18:40.140]  into a tree they told us he was driving a hundred miles an hour but everybody
[01:18:40.140 --> 01:18:45.300]  that knew him said he drove like a granny and then it came out that he was
[01:18:45.300 --> 01:18:52.020]  being investigated by the FBI of course we knew that he had made enemies within
[01:18:52.020 --> 01:18:57.060]  the military community when he was doing reporting but we knew that we'd learned
[01:18:57.060 --> 01:19:00.900]  that he was doing an investigation he was on the run he told all his friends I
[01:19:00.900 --> 01:19:05.700]  need to disappear for a while and then we see that car crash that happened and
[01:19:05.700 --> 01:19:09.300]  quite frankly I don't think that the car blew up when it hit the tree either I
[01:19:09.300 --> 01:19:13.260]  think there was multiple things involved in my opinion somebody was making that
[01:19:13.260 --> 01:19:16.940]  car drive a hundred miles an hour and I think that there was a detonation of a
[01:19:16.940 --> 01:19:21.060]  bomb that caused that engine to continue down the same path it was and then the
[01:19:21.060 --> 01:19:27.180]  car came to a relatively gentle rest against a tree the gas tank was never
[01:19:27.180 --> 01:19:30.780]  involved it you can see the pictures of it it wasn't burning from there it was
[01:19:30.780 --> 01:19:35.220]  burning from where he was and it didn't smash into a car there's just a an
[01:19:35.220 --> 01:19:39.660]  article a week or two ago the same model Mercedes a couple of teenagers were
[01:19:39.660 --> 01:19:43.700]  out driving they hit a tree it cut their car in half that didn't happen with
[01:19:43.700 --> 01:19:48.300]  Michael Hastings that's the potential for abuse yet another example of how we
[01:19:48.300 --> 01:19:52.060]  could give this kind of power to the government to corporations it can be
[01:19:52.060 --> 01:19:55.500]  abused by evil people stay with us when we come back we're going to talk about

[01:23:05.140 --> 01:23:08.020]  us have had that moment when we recognize that we need to be better
[01:23:08.020 --> 01:23:12.020]  prepared we typically do the same thing we start with food storage then we
[01:23:12.020 --> 01:23:16.420]  address the need for water but have you considered heat storage I'm talking about
[01:23:16.420 --> 01:23:20.660]  staying warm in the cold here are some things for you to consider how will I
[01:23:20.660 --> 01:23:24.660]  keep my family warm the standard answers are firewood coal or propane but the
[01:23:24.660 --> 01:23:28.500]  problem with that if you need to be on the move is you can't take it with you
[01:23:28.500 --> 01:23:32.860]  another concern there may come a time when you need to stay warm without smoke
[01:23:32.860 --> 01:23:37.060]  like in times of war there may even come a time when you can't burn fuel the
[01:23:37.060 --> 01:23:41.980]  answers may be simpler and less costly than you think for these answers go to

[01:24:08.540 --> 01:24:12.140]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight as we were talking in the
[01:24:12.140 --> 01:24:17.420]  last segment when we have bad people and we will always have bad people in every
[01:24:17.420 --> 01:24:21.140]  line of work it makes it all the more important for us to have a legal
[01:24:21.140 --> 01:24:25.660]  framework that protects us all that's why we have the Bill of Rights and of
[01:24:25.660 --> 01:24:30.020]  course there's good cops and there's bad cops we had Frank Cervico talks about
[01:24:30.020 --> 01:24:34.260]  that quite a bit he says the test of the system is does it protect you from the
[01:24:34.260 --> 01:24:39.140]  bad cops can it purge the bad cops look at this story that's up on infowars.com
[01:24:39.140 --> 01:24:44.660]  a police officer fine for driving without a license for 25 years 25 years he
[01:24:44.660 --> 01:24:50.460]  didn't have a license say that's the kind of above-the-law attitude that we
[01:24:50.460 --> 01:24:54.580]  see frequently but let me play something for you that's from a good cop
[01:24:54.580 --> 01:24:59.860]  this is from the Bradford County Sheriff Gordon Smith talking about the
[01:24:59.860 --> 01:25:03.500]  Bill of Rights talking about the protections of our fundamental rights
[01:25:03.500 --> 01:25:08.900]  to keep and own arms talking about open carry in Florida here's a slip we have
[01:25:08.900 --> 01:25:18.980]  Sheriff Gordon Smith Bradford County Sheriff Gordon Gordon Smith Sheriff of
[01:25:18.980 --> 01:25:21.900]  Bradford County I'd like to come before you say thank you for allowing me to
[01:25:21.900 --> 01:25:24.980]  speak briefly I had a prepared speech I want to speak from the heart and keep it
[01:25:24.980 --> 01:25:29.860]  short I call this crime prevention 101 Bill because any law enforcement worth
[01:25:29.860 --> 01:25:35.140]  their grain of salt knows that criminals pick soft targets easy targets to rob
[01:25:35.140 --> 01:25:39.620]  rape and pilfer and there's something wrong with that because when they call
[01:25:39.620 --> 01:25:42.740]  9-1-1 they have to have a way to defend themselves between them making that
[01:25:42.740 --> 01:25:48.260]  phone call and the police arriving there and I'll tell you this any crowd I go
[01:25:48.260 --> 01:25:52.500]  to I'd rather know who's got the gun than guessing who's got the gun and 790
[01:25:52.500 --> 01:25:56.540]  statute with the concealed permit that you have to have says you must display
[01:25:56.540 --> 01:26:01.180]  upon law enforcement officer officer asking you your concealed weapons and
[01:26:01.180 --> 01:26:06.140]  your driver's license so when I see that person carrying a weapon on their side
[01:26:06.140 --> 01:26:10.460]  ones they got to have a permit so it means our law-abiding lawful citizen of
[01:26:10.460 --> 01:26:14.900]  the state of Florida I believe in the right of a person to protect themselves
[01:26:14.900 --> 01:26:20.100]  and their family the way they best feel comfortable some people don't like guns
[01:26:20.100 --> 01:26:24.300]  I'm okay with that get a can of wasp spray if it works for you what I'm
[01:26:24.300 --> 01:26:31.380]  telling you is I want to be clear there are no factual or rational reasons to
[01:26:31.380 --> 01:26:37.180]  oppose open carry we can what if it the death we can give scenarios but 45 other
[01:26:37.180 --> 01:26:42.620]  states give us a model look at those areas you can make up all the stories
[01:26:42.620 --> 01:26:49.020]  you want to but there are no factual reasons to oppose if you believe in
[01:26:49.020 --> 01:26:54.740]  America our Constitution and love the people of Florida allow our law-abiding
[01:26:54.740 --> 01:26:59.180]  citizens to choose how they protect themselves and their family and I will
[01:26:59.180 --> 01:27:03.140]  speak as the sheriff could representing the heartbeat of Florida that's where
[01:27:03.140 --> 01:27:07.460]  Bradford County is right between Jacksonville and Gainesville you look
[01:27:07.460 --> 01:27:10.460]  around and I can tell you I've been all over this state there's some cops with
[01:27:10.460 --> 01:27:15.260]  guns that probably don't need them I'm gonna speak loud and I'm gonna speak
[01:27:15.260 --> 01:27:18.380]  clear about it I don't know about my other sheriff's but I can tell you as
[01:27:18.380 --> 01:27:21.620]  Bradford County sheriff I go on the record for open carry it's the best
[01:27:21.620 --> 01:27:26.300]  thing for the state of Florida thank you thank you sheriff Gordon well good for
[01:27:26.300 --> 01:27:29.860]  him good for him and let me tell you something and that showed this clip of
[01:27:29.860 --> 01:27:33.740]  this article that I have right here 3d printing used to make a real handgun
[01:27:33.740 --> 01:27:38.580]  handheld railgun which fires for plasma projectiles at 560 miles per hour take a
[01:27:38.580 --> 01:27:42.360]  look at that picture see that picture that's what's going to happen if you go
[01:27:42.360 --> 01:27:48.380]  to gun prohibition that's going to be the meth equivalent of the truck war
[01:27:48.380 --> 01:27:53.100]  in the in the gun prohibition wars okay people are going to make their own
[01:27:53.100 --> 01:27:56.820]  weapons they're going to make all kinds of crazy stuff you may wind up with a
[01:27:56.820 --> 01:28:00.420]  lot more dangerous firearms on the street than you have right now to those
[01:28:00.420 --> 01:28:04.820]  of you who are afraid of guns just understand that understand that with
[01:28:04.820 --> 01:28:09.620]  alcohol prohibition we got far more dangerous forms of alcohol after
[01:28:09.620 --> 01:28:13.220]  prohibition the same thing has happened with the war on drugs things like meth
[01:28:13.220 --> 01:28:18.020]  that people had not dreamed of that is made possible by your prohibition
[01:28:18.020 --> 01:28:21.500]  environment and so if you want to prohibit firearms you're going to wind up
[01:28:21.500 --> 01:28:26.580]  with things like these homemade 3d printing guns a railgun whatever people
[01:28:26.580 --> 01:28:31.260]  are going to use their their ingenuity to create whatever they wish and of
[01:28:31.260 --> 01:28:36.100]  course there's going to be a huge huge profit motive like there is in any black
[01:28:36.100 --> 01:28:40.740]  market so it's good to see a sheriff like that sheriff there Bradford County
[01:28:40.740 --> 01:28:45.180]  Sheriff Gordon Smith in Florida speaking in favor of open carry I like what he
[01:28:45.180 --> 01:28:48.540]  had to say he said there's some police officers who shouldn't be owning guns
[01:28:48.540 --> 01:28:54.300]  and that's absolutely true we need good people in office that's why I said so
[01:28:54.300 --> 01:28:58.980]  many times don't focus so much into the exclusion of everything else on the
[01:28:58.980 --> 01:29:03.940]  presidential race you need to get good people in at the local level especially
[01:29:03.940 --> 01:29:08.340]  at the sheriff's office level you need to get people in at the state
[01:29:08.340 --> 01:29:13.300]  legislature at the state House at the state Senate to make sure that you're
[01:29:13.300 --> 01:29:16.940]  going they're going to stand for your rights against any federal incursions we
[01:29:16.940 --> 01:29:20.540]  have a massive bureaucracy at the federal level I don't think most
[01:29:20.540 --> 01:29:25.340]  presidential candidates certainly I don't see anybody on either party that I
[01:29:25.340 --> 01:29:29.220]  think is going to be able to stand up and dismantle this massive bureaucracy
[01:29:29.220 --> 01:29:34.140]  at least not without help at the state and local level that's why you need to
[01:29:34.140 --> 01:29:38.180]  focus there however when we come back we're going to talk about what's going
[01:29:38.180 --> 01:29:42.860]  on with this massive distraction we call the presidential election stay with
[01:29:42.860 --> 01:29:45.460]  us we'll be right back
[01:29:47.020 --> 01:29:54.060]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[01:29:54.060 --> 01:29:56.340]  network
[01:29:58.060 --> 01:30:03.140]  do you know what it means to be an American it's more than a flag it's more
[01:30:03.140 --> 01:30:07.220]  than knowing the star-spangled banner it's knowing the Constitution it's
[01:30:07.220 --> 01:30:11.460]  understanding those rights and fighting for them our country is falling apart
[01:30:11.460 --> 01:30:15.740]  because people have forgotten to fight to stand up in the face of tyranny and do
[01:30:15.740 --> 01:30:19.820]  the right thing it's putting your life on the line to protect your country from
[01:30:19.820 --> 01:30:23.820]  enemies both foreign and domestic the Bill of Rights is what the people are
[01:30:23.820 --> 01:30:28.940]  entitled to against every government and no government should refuse or rest on
[01:30:28.940 --> 01:30:33.740]  inference so the Tree of Liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the

[01:33:21.820 --> 01:33:26.340]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight your host yesterday Alex
[01:33:26.340 --> 01:33:32.900]  talked to a scientist about his newest water filter this is Dr. Evan Coslow he
[01:33:32.900 --> 01:33:37.780]  talked to about the Alexa Pure Pro that we're now carrying at infowarsstore.com
[01:33:37.780 --> 01:33:43.460]  a very interesting and a bit different approach to gravity feed water filters
[01:33:43.460 --> 01:33:49.340]  here's a video of partial video of that that interview yesterday right down why
[01:33:49.340 --> 01:33:54.500]  you're so proud of these filters well I mean this the Alexa Pure is really a
[01:33:54.500 --> 01:33:59.060]  culmination of all of my experience it was posed to me as an extremely
[01:33:59.060 --> 01:34:03.900]  challenging project they wanted a product that would actually operate
[01:34:03.900 --> 01:34:07.700]  without any electricity they had no pressure you have to do it all by
[01:34:07.700 --> 01:34:12.380]  gravity and they needed they really effectively said we need everything
[01:34:12.380 --> 01:34:18.780]  imaginable to be removed efficiently way higher than 99% and so the result was
[01:34:18.780 --> 01:34:24.580]  it was it's an extreme challenge worked on it for quite a long time and
[01:34:24.580 --> 01:34:28.740]  basically what we've done is we created a the only filter to my knowledge
[01:34:28.740 --> 01:34:36.620]  that hits all three it will remove effectively all the major metals all the
[01:34:36.620 --> 01:34:42.060]  major non-metal such as fluoride it will take out all known microbiological
[01:34:42.060 --> 01:34:47.700]  threats including viral bacterial and zest and it will take out organic
[01:34:47.700 --> 01:34:52.340]  chemicals of pretty much everything with without exception it's a very very
[01:34:52.340 --> 01:34:56.060]  powerful device I don't believe that there's anything else out there in the
[01:34:56.060 --> 01:34:59.740]  world that can do that especially under gravity flow conditions they fit and
[01:34:59.740 --> 01:35:03.620]  finish are fantastic no no compromise was made on the quality of the
[01:35:03.620 --> 01:35:09.500]  construction so I mean it's really a remarkable achievement on their part and
[01:35:09.500 --> 01:35:13.700]  I feel very proud actually to be part of the team that put that together what's
[01:35:13.700 --> 01:35:18.460]  your view overall on fluoride well okay so we actually tested against both the
[01:35:18.460 --> 01:35:22.460]  fluoride ion and the fluorosilicate that you mentioned which is the additive
[01:35:22.460 --> 01:35:27.460]  that people put into water under federal control and basically we remove both
[01:35:27.460 --> 01:35:32.700]  them with equal efficiency so we wanted to be sure that no matter how fluoride
[01:35:32.700 --> 01:35:37.100]  is added to the water can be intercepted and removed so that's how we've dealt
[01:35:37.100 --> 01:35:40.580]  with that all I can tell you is that we tested against all known fluoride
[01:35:40.580 --> 01:35:45.020]  chemicals that are added to water the new ones and the old ones and we remove
[01:35:45.020 --> 01:35:49.180]  them all of equal efficiency as your belief that this is the best gravity-fed
[01:35:49.180 --> 01:35:53.660]  filter of the design out there available to the public without a doubt I mean
[01:35:53.660 --> 01:35:58.700]  most these gravity flow filters are at best simple particulate filters they
[01:35:58.700 --> 01:36:03.220]  remove dirt and debris sediment they're not going to be capable of
[01:36:03.220 --> 01:36:07.460]  intercepting a viral particle to the degree we're talking quantitative
[01:36:07.460 --> 01:36:10.940]  reduction below detection you know one can touch that kind of capability well
[01:36:10.940 --> 01:36:16.220]  I'm impressed and I want to thank you so much for your time today it is the
[01:36:16.220 --> 01:36:22.900]  Lexapure Pro family of water filtration systems available discounted exclusively
[01:36:22.900 --> 01:36:28.940]  at info wars store.com I want to thank Mr. Redhawk for allowing us to be part of
[01:36:28.940 --> 01:36:34.500]  the launch of this it's on sale right now for their main unit $177 leading
[01:36:34.500 --> 01:36:37.980]  competitors that aren't even as good or more than that and they've also got this
[01:36:37.980 --> 01:36:46.220]  is the survival spring type straw system for survival that is an absolute must
[01:36:46.220 --> 01:36:54.700]  have okay and again that is the new Alexa Pro Alexa Pure Pro filter and that
[01:36:54.700 --> 01:37:01.100]  is available at info wars store.com so gravity-fed water filtration system it
[01:37:01.100 --> 01:37:05.380]  will filter out bacteria viruses fluoride disinfectants volatile organic
[01:37:05.380 --> 01:37:09.460]  contaminants and hormones that is something that is very important you
[01:37:09.460 --> 01:37:12.820]  know if you're if you're in the city you have there's a lot of things that you
[01:37:12.820 --> 01:37:15.780]  have to worry about you have to worry about fluoride you have to also worry
[01:37:15.780 --> 01:37:18.980]  about things like chlorine in your drinking water you want to get that
[01:37:18.980 --> 01:37:24.500]  filtered out before you drink it but if you're in the country as I am I also want
[01:37:24.500 --> 01:37:28.940]  to make sure that I get things like agricultural runoff things like glyphosate
[01:37:28.940 --> 01:37:33.140]  things like hormones that they're feeding the agricultural that they're
[01:37:33.140 --> 01:37:36.140]  feeding the animals that sort of thing I want to make sure that I don't have that
[01:37:36.140 --> 01:37:39.820]  in my groundwater so we use that and one of the things I like about this I'm
[01:37:39.820 --> 01:37:45.500]  gonna pick up one of these because it has a filter capacity of 5,000 gallons
[01:37:45.500 --> 01:37:49.300]  that's an amazing amount of time that filter is going to last and again as he
[01:37:49.300 --> 01:37:53.340]  pointed out that is something that you want to have if you've got a power down
[01:37:53.340 --> 01:37:56.820]  situation you don't want to lose your water filtration system like you would
[01:37:56.820 --> 01:38:00.260]  with some of these reverse osmosis filters or something that require
[01:38:00.260 --> 01:38:04.980]  electricity to operate you want to have something that's very simple that is
[01:38:04.980 --> 01:38:09.260]  gravity-fed again you can get that at info wars store.com that is the Alexa
[01:38:09.260 --> 01:38:14.660]  Pure Pro filter that's the gravity-fed water filter brand-new filter and that
[01:38:14.660 --> 01:38:18.260]  was the scientists who designed it that Alex was talking to yesterday Dr. Evan
[01:38:18.260 --> 01:38:23.500]  Coslow now I want to talk about something that I think is very important
[01:38:23.500 --> 01:38:27.900]  we spend a lot of time talking about the presidential race and it's important
[01:38:27.900 --> 01:38:31.180]  to understand where the people are going as I've mentioned before you need to
[01:38:31.180 --> 01:38:34.940]  think nationally think globally understand where the agendas are
[01:38:34.940 --> 01:38:39.820]  understand who the players are but still act locally as much as you can we
[01:38:39.820 --> 01:38:46.700]  played a clip from a sheriff in Florida who was very much pro-gun a strong
[01:38:46.700 --> 01:38:51.460]  advocate for people having open carry speaking at a city council meeting where
[01:38:51.460 --> 01:38:55.700]  he was sheriff it's important to get people like that in office locally
[01:38:55.700 --> 01:39:00.180]  they're going to have a lot of power to protect your rights so get those people
[01:39:00.180 --> 01:39:04.940]  in work with them identify those kinds of people but understand too that if we
[01:39:04.940 --> 01:39:09.980]  want to try to divide and conquer the federal government and that's one of
[01:39:09.980 --> 01:39:12.660]  the things that we need to be working at that was the founders design you know
[01:39:12.660 --> 01:39:16.380]  when I talk about the presidential race when I talk about the speaker race I
[01:39:16.380 --> 01:39:21.020]  had somebody send me a note on Twitter and said do you really need a leader to
[01:39:21.020 --> 01:39:25.500]  save you and protect you David and it's like no I certainly don't but they
[01:39:25.500 --> 01:39:30.460]  understand how powerful divide and conquer is and we need to divide and
[01:39:30.460 --> 01:39:34.020]  conquer the federal government that's what the founders who wrote the
[01:39:34.020 --> 01:39:37.660]  Constitution were concerned about you understand that they divided the
[01:39:37.660 --> 01:39:43.460]  federal government into three opposing parts and they also divided power
[01:39:43.460 --> 01:39:48.540]  between the federal government the state and the people people having things
[01:39:48.540 --> 01:39:52.860]  like elections which they've now rigged but also things like jury
[01:39:52.860 --> 01:39:56.500]  nullification which we need to take back the understanding of there are
[01:39:56.500 --> 01:40:01.260]  different mechanisms that people would have to directly affect their freedom and
[01:40:01.260 --> 01:40:04.420]  so we need to understand that the founders were concerned more than
[01:40:04.420 --> 01:40:10.500]  anything about the consolidation of power into the center so they divided that
[01:40:10.500 --> 01:40:15.820]  power between the federal state and local and people and they also divided
[01:40:15.820 --> 01:40:20.580]  the federal government itself and now though we have a situation where there's
[01:40:20.580 --> 01:40:25.020]  been a consolidation in Washington one of the things that we can do is to try
[01:40:25.020 --> 01:40:30.380]  to make sure that we don't have a monolithic leadership in Washington that
[01:40:30.380 --> 01:40:35.460]  is that all of the leaders of both parties whether it's in Congress or
[01:40:35.460 --> 01:40:38.900]  whether it's the president or whether it's even the Supreme Court which we
[01:40:38.900 --> 01:40:44.140]  don't have any direct election control of but we need to make sure that the
[01:40:44.140 --> 01:40:48.300]  people who are in the presidency at least and in the Congress are not all
[01:40:48.300 --> 01:40:53.780]  working toward the same unified goals how do we do that well we do it by
[01:40:53.780 --> 01:40:57.540]  getting rid of people like John Boehner who is on the same page as Nancy
[01:40:57.540 --> 01:41:02.700]  Pelosi on the really big issues the big issues that are going to completely
[01:41:02.700 --> 01:41:09.220]  alter our economy completely alter our sovereignty our national borders open
[01:41:09.220 --> 01:41:13.540]  and open borders the new trade agreements that are being negotiated
[01:41:13.540 --> 01:41:17.380]  that they tell us have been finished but we here we are weeks after they tell us
[01:41:17.380 --> 01:41:21.420]  they've been finished they still won't show them to us now as Boehner is
[01:41:21.420 --> 01:41:26.820]  stepping down we had Kevin McCarthy that he offered and Kevin McCarthy set step
[01:41:26.820 --> 01:41:29.420]  down so Boehner said that's it we're gonna have the election until I get
[01:41:29.420 --> 01:41:33.220]  somebody that I like well it looks like the person he wants is Paul Ryan or I
[01:41:33.220 --> 01:41:38.300]  think we ought to call him Paul Ryan O because he is a rhino and we see that
[01:41:38.300 --> 01:41:43.380]  the White House the White House likes Paul Rhino why do they like Paul Rhino
[01:41:43.380 --> 01:41:48.580]  well the president said he believes Congressman Rhino is someone who has
[01:41:48.580 --> 01:41:52.580]  given considerable thought to the significant issues that must be worked
[01:41:52.580 --> 01:41:57.820]  through in Congress and the White House Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz
[01:41:57.820 --> 01:42:02.220]  said this specifically they singled him out for working with the
[01:42:02.220 --> 01:42:05.940]  administration to grant the Obama administration Trans Pacific Trade
[01:42:05.940 --> 01:42:12.140]  Authority and his efforts to work with them on open borders you see they can
[01:42:12.140 --> 01:42:17.180]  have their differences they can keep up this facade of the left right paradigm
[01:42:17.180 --> 01:42:22.140]  but when it comes to what they're really after they have a common agenda
[01:42:22.140 --> 01:42:24.900]  whether you're talking about the Democrat leadership or the Republican
[01:42:24.900 --> 01:42:30.740]  leadership they want a consolidation of global governance Senator Sessions who
[01:42:30.740 --> 01:42:36.860]  took the time to look at the agreement said we're creating a transnational
[01:42:36.860 --> 01:42:41.980]  institution here with these treaties that will be able to write this without
[01:42:41.980 --> 01:42:44.540]  our approval without any further involvement from us and of course it's
[01:42:44.540 --> 01:42:48.460]  going to be presented to the Congress and they will not be allowed to make any
[01:42:48.460 --> 01:42:51.820]  amendments or any changes it'll be a straight up or down vote it'll be
[01:42:51.820 --> 01:42:57.300]  accelerated they'll bypass all the usual processes that would stop a bill
[01:42:57.300 --> 01:43:01.420]  possibly from getting through that's something that Paul Ryan has already
[01:43:01.420 --> 01:43:03.860]  worked with the White House to make sure it's going to happen that was a trade
[01:43:03.860 --> 01:43:07.820]  promotion authority the TPA and of course with that in place they can get
[01:43:07.820 --> 01:43:14.740]  the TPP the TTIP the TISA the trade and services agreement so there's all these
[01:43:14.740 --> 01:43:19.020]  different agreements that can be put in for the next six years because people
[01:43:19.020 --> 01:43:23.460]  like Paul Ryan worked with the Obama administration to make sure that we
[01:43:23.460 --> 01:43:28.340]  didn't have a constitutional process to approve treaties and we know that once
[01:43:28.340 --> 01:43:31.260]  this treaty is approved from what Senator Sessions told us they can change
[01:43:31.260 --> 01:43:35.060]  anything about the treaty that they want to isn't that amazing they can add
[01:43:35.060 --> 01:43:37.980]  anybody under the treaty that they want to as well we're told we have to have
[01:43:37.980 --> 01:43:41.340]  this because we need protection from China well China could be added the day
[01:43:41.340 --> 01:43:45.620]  after they approve this treaty China could be added to the TPP and they could
[01:43:45.620 --> 01:43:50.340]  change anything about it and of course it's going to create it's going to
[01:43:50.340 --> 01:43:54.580]  elevate the corporations who wrote this to the level of government of course
[01:43:54.580 --> 01:43:57.380]  they're already really above government because they're the ones who wrote it
[01:43:57.380 --> 01:44:00.020]  they're the ones who are telling our senators that they can't talk about it so
[01:44:00.020 --> 01:44:05.660]  we need somebody like Paul Ryan who is going to toe the line that Nancy Pelosi
[01:44:05.660 --> 01:44:10.100]  and John Boehner have been doing and of course they have shown that they don't
[01:44:10.100 --> 01:44:13.140]  really care for the process either because one of the ways that you ram
[01:44:13.140 --> 01:44:17.260]  this through just like we see with these trade agreements you want to make sure
[01:44:17.260 --> 01:44:20.420]  that you don't have to go through the constitutional process of setting up a
[01:44:20.420 --> 01:44:24.260]  treaty and when you're somebody operating a speaker like Nancy Pelosi did
[01:44:24.260 --> 01:44:27.900]  like John Boehner did you want to make sure that you don't get encumbered by
[01:44:27.900 --> 01:44:32.100]  all the constitutional requirements all the legal requirements to get a bill
[01:44:32.100 --> 01:44:36.740]  passed you just want to make people do what you say and punish them if they
[01:44:36.740 --> 01:44:42.420]  don't do that because that could delay their agenda so we have a tyranny that
[01:44:42.420 --> 01:44:46.220]  is being run by people the leadership of both parties are not really very
[01:44:46.220 --> 01:44:49.740]  different again to illustrate this again we have two house Democrats one from
[01:44:49.740 --> 01:44:54.380]  California one from New York saying they support Paul Ryan Nancy Pelosi is kind
[01:44:54.380 --> 01:44:59.260]  of indirectly thrown her support to him we see Pew polling however saying that
[01:44:59.260 --> 01:45:06.180]  at least 93% of the GOP electorate opposes Paul Ryan on immigration because
[01:45:06.180 --> 01:45:10.500]  he has been open borders for his entire career going all the way back to the
[01:45:10.500 --> 01:45:17.540]  point when he was a staffer working for Jack Kemp and of course even Ann
[01:45:17.540 --> 01:45:23.340]  Coulter came out and said you know he's he's part of the Kemp boys because
[01:45:23.340 --> 01:45:27.300]  that's where he got his start in politics working for Jack Kemp this is a
[01:45:27.300 --> 01:45:31.500]  story that was on the drudge report save us from Paul Ryan and the Kemp boys
[01:45:31.500 --> 01:45:34.900]  she says by now there's been approximately a million studies on the
[01:45:34.900 --> 01:45:40.460]  effects of Jack Kemp's enterprise zones of his empowerment zones and of
[01:45:40.460 --> 01:45:45.300]  Obama's version the promise zones the conclusion every single penny has been
[01:45:45.300 --> 01:45:49.700]  wasted businesses game the system they relocate shops from just outside the
[01:45:49.700 --> 01:45:53.660]  zone to just within it or they take tax credits for doing nothing that they
[01:45:53.660 --> 01:45:56.860]  weren't already planning to do the principal result of Kemp's enterprise
[01:45:56.860 --> 01:46:01.380]  zones was to double HUD's budget so that's where Paul Ryan got his start but
[01:46:01.380 --> 01:46:06.020]  of course Jack Kemp and others were also about open borders and open
[01:46:06.020 --> 01:46:10.820]  immigration and this isn't something about any particular demographic group
[01:46:10.820 --> 01:46:15.500]  we see that it's different demographic groups that are being used in Europe as
[01:46:15.500 --> 01:46:21.340]  well it's all about the clowered and piven strategy we see that Sweden is on
[01:46:21.340 --> 01:46:25.620]  the verge of economic collapse because they've had massive immigration for a
[01:46:25.620 --> 01:46:30.620]  number of years we see that rape in Sweden is at epidemic proportions one
[01:46:30.620 --> 01:46:35.940]  out of four women in Sweden they believe are going to be statistically will be
[01:46:35.940 --> 01:46:40.460]  raped and yet I think it's kind of ironic that even with that kind of
[01:46:40.460 --> 01:46:46.940]  statistic that you've got Julian Assange they're coming after him for an
[01:46:46.940 --> 01:46:51.020]  alleged rape in Sweden of all places where they tolerate this they can they
[01:46:51.020 --> 01:46:54.860]  won't change the policies for open borders even though 25% of the women
[01:46:54.860 --> 01:46:58.700]  are likely to get raped there based on their statistics they won't do anything
[01:46:58.700 --> 01:47:04.140]  about open borders to change that but they will spend years surrounding Julian
[01:47:04.140 --> 01:47:09.100]  Assange they will spend millions of dollars trying to capture him out of the
[01:47:09.100 --> 01:47:14.340]  Ecuadorian embassy there and of course we know that that was just a setup we
[01:47:14.340 --> 01:47:17.420]  know that was because he blew the whistle on criminal actions by the
[01:47:17.420 --> 01:47:22.180]  government nevertheless that's the open border issue to have global governance
[01:47:22.180 --> 01:47:27.420]  they have to destroy individual national sovereignty they have to turn it into an
[01:47:27.420 --> 01:47:33.180]  illusion and of course Paul Ryan said as many Democrats have said America is it
[01:47:33.180 --> 01:47:38.420]  really so much a physical country as it is just an idea and of course he's
[01:47:38.420 --> 01:47:42.740]  changing what's behind that idea now the saddest thing about this is that the
[01:47:42.740 --> 01:47:47.780]  House Freedom Caucus which we've been told is going to be the as the Washington
[01:47:47.780 --> 01:47:51.300]  Post puts it the hard line conservatives it looks like they're not
[01:47:51.300 --> 01:47:55.060]  taking a hard line anymore looks like they're not going to fight against this
[01:47:55.060 --> 01:47:59.380]  kind of dictatorial speakership that we have seen from the Republican and
[01:47:59.380 --> 01:48:03.940]  Democrat leadership they're not going to fight against someone who is a full-out
[01:48:03.940 --> 01:48:09.700]  open globalist who wants open borders who wants this corporate trade agreement
[01:48:09.700 --> 01:48:13.120]  that's being pushed through I know they're saying that they're going to
[01:48:13.120 --> 01:48:19.500]  possibly support Paul Ryan and except for a few like Louis Gohmert who says
[01:48:19.500 --> 01:48:24.420]  he is not going to support him and of course Paul Ryan's conditions for doing
[01:48:24.420 --> 01:48:29.060]  this is that they cannot throw him out he wants them to get rid of the very
[01:48:29.060 --> 01:48:34.220]  motion that is being used to push out John Boehner the vacate the chair motion
[01:48:34.220 --> 01:48:38.500]  he wants that taken off the table he's not going to make any promises about
[01:48:38.500 --> 01:48:41.500]  what he will do to conservatives and of course the reason that the
[01:48:41.500 --> 01:48:46.460]  conservatives are pushing back on this is like I just point out 93% of the GOP
[01:48:46.460 --> 01:48:51.140]  voters oppose Paul Ryan on open borders that's what he has defined himself on
[01:48:51.140 --> 01:48:56.980]  and the GOP voters don't like that that's why the GOP voters voted in a
[01:48:56.980 --> 01:49:02.660]  majority in the GOP and yet they betrayed them and so it really is a test at
[01:49:02.660 --> 01:49:07.180]  this moment is there anyone in Washington left who is going to pay any
[01:49:07.180 --> 01:49:12.340]  attention to the voters that's the thing you need to keep in mind when you
[01:49:12.340 --> 01:49:16.900]  look at the presidential election they want you to focus strictly and solely on
[01:49:16.900 --> 01:49:21.420]  the presidential election as if electing one guy is going to change
[01:49:21.420 --> 01:49:25.700]  everything for you it simply isn't and you have to understand when you look at
[01:49:25.700 --> 01:49:29.580]  the promises that these people are making that they have carefully crafted
[01:49:29.580 --> 01:49:34.300]  their position papers for the most part you'll see that that they're talking
[01:49:34.300 --> 01:49:38.220]  about exactly the same issues in exactly the same ways whether they're
[01:49:38.220 --> 01:49:41.460]  Republicans or Democrats they've got the Republican issues they've got the
[01:49:41.460 --> 01:49:46.620]  Democrat issues and they're talking to the voters with these consultants that
[01:49:46.620 --> 01:49:50.380]  have put this together they're selling they're closing the deal that's why I'm
[01:49:50.380 --> 01:49:53.700]  concerned about Donald Trump as I've said many times he's got some great
[01:49:53.700 --> 01:49:56.620]  position papers that he's put out there I don't agree with everything that's in
[01:49:56.620 --> 01:50:00.180]  the position papers but he's put out very detailed position papers the question
[01:50:00.180 --> 01:50:05.940]  is do you think you can trust him to deliver on these position papers or
[01:50:05.940 --> 01:50:11.540]  he's is he just closing a deal with you take a look at this article Donald
[01:50:11.540 --> 01:50:16.500]  Trump's speeches are at fourth grade levels as a study and I looked at that
[01:50:16.500 --> 01:50:19.380]  and I thought I'm surprised that it's that high I guess it shows how far
[01:50:19.380 --> 01:50:23.020]  educational standards have dropped since I've been in elementary school they go
[01:50:23.020 --> 01:50:26.900]  on and say that Bernie Sanders comes in at the highest level when they test
[01:50:26.900 --> 01:50:29.940]  these things out they say he comes in at the tenth grade level this is
[01:50:29.940 --> 01:50:35.180]  according to a Flesher Kincaid readability test they say that Abraham
[01:50:35.180 --> 01:50:39.740]  Lincoln was at an 11th grade level and the founders like George Washington were
[01:50:39.740 --> 01:50:45.820]  postgraduate they were at the 17th grade level I guess that's why people don't
[01:50:45.820 --> 01:50:51.300]  understand the basic principles of individual liberty anymore maybe they
[01:50:51.300 --> 01:50:54.540]  lost them when they lost their vocabulary but it's a deliberate

[01:54:11.980 --> 01:54:15.780]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Iyer host on this Friday October
[01:54:15.780 --> 01:54:21.940]  23rd 2015 I was going to continue on with some presidential candidate updates but
[01:54:21.940 --> 01:54:25.500]  I think I'm going to take a diversion here as we're talking about open borders
[01:54:25.500 --> 01:54:29.940]  and open immigration with Paul Ryan I want you to understand I want you to
[01:54:29.940 --> 01:54:35.780]  contact your congressman I want you to put some backbone in them because this
[01:54:35.780 --> 01:54:39.900]  is something that is going to happen before the presidential race this is
[01:54:39.900 --> 01:54:44.140]  nearly as important as a presidential race if you think the presidential race
[01:54:44.140 --> 01:54:48.620]  is important this is the person who is third in line in power after the
[01:54:48.620 --> 01:54:51.820]  president the vice president the speaker of the house would become president so
[01:54:51.820 --> 01:54:56.020]  it's a very high office there's a lot of power in that office there's power to
[01:54:56.020 --> 01:55:01.020]  make change and there's power to make change in a very bad way and that's the
[01:55:01.020 --> 01:55:05.100]  way Paul Ryan is going to use that power we've already seen that he is for open
[01:55:05.100 --> 01:55:10.220]  borders we've already seen that he is for enacting massive sovereignty destroying
[01:55:10.220 --> 01:55:16.260]  trade agreements without doing the treaty process that's in the Constitution and
[01:55:16.260 --> 01:55:19.860]  I want you to take a look at how this works we've mentioned Sweden look at
[01:55:19.860 --> 01:55:24.180]  this headline Sweden almost triples refugee estimates as their system
[01:55:24.180 --> 01:55:29.780]  buckles remember we talked about Cloward and Piven that is the socialist the
[01:55:29.780 --> 01:55:35.220]  couple of socialists who said we can remake our society but first we need to
[01:55:35.220 --> 01:55:39.380]  destroy it you always hear that right of course that was the line that Robert
[01:55:39.380 --> 01:55:44.940]  Redford's character had in the Captain America movie so we're going to destroy
[01:55:44.940 --> 01:55:48.900]  the system so we can rebuild it the way we want it well you had a couple of
[01:55:48.900 --> 01:55:53.060]  socialists said that we want a socialist system so let's do a couple of things
[01:55:53.060 --> 01:55:56.700]  number one we will create huge entitlement programs and then we'll
[01:55:56.700 --> 01:56:00.580]  expand the number of people that qualify for those entitlement programs and one
[01:56:00.580 --> 01:56:04.180]  of the ways that you do that is by opening up the borders completely so
[01:56:04.180 --> 01:56:07.620]  that's being done to Europe it's being done to North America at the same time
[01:56:07.620 --> 01:56:11.740]  and we see that it is now having the effect where the place where you have
[01:56:11.740 --> 01:56:16.420]  the largest socialist welfare states Sweden for example they're the first
[01:56:16.420 --> 01:56:19.940]  ones to start buckling and they're buckling under the weight of this
[01:56:19.940 --> 01:56:25.180]  uncontrolled open border you cannot support a system where everybody can
[01:56:25.180 --> 01:56:30.260]  come to your country and get a free education free housing all these other
[01:56:30.260 --> 01:56:33.060]  entitlements that people are putting out there we're going to talk about Bernie
[01:56:33.060 --> 01:56:36.900]  Sanders I think we need to start calling him Bernie Sanders Nista
[01:56:36.900 --> 01:56:42.540]  he had a video we're going to talk about that a little bit back in 1985 where
[01:56:42.540 --> 01:56:47.660]  he had gone down to Nicaragua and looked at the socialist paradise that was
[01:56:47.660 --> 01:56:50.940]  being created there by the Sandinistas and he had nothing but good things to
[01:56:50.940 --> 01:56:54.780]  say about it so we're going to look at what Bernie Sanders had to say in 1985
[01:56:54.780 --> 01:57:00.740]  about the Sandinistas and we're going to see how Bernie sander Nista failed to
[01:57:00.740 --> 01:57:05.540]  realize what was really going on there and still 30 years later doesn't
[01:57:05.540 --> 01:57:10.740]  understand what's going on with socialism he's still clueless but take a
[01:57:10.740 --> 01:57:14.380]  look at this as well Sweden on the verge of collapse as illegal immigrants
[01:57:14.380 --> 01:57:17.980]  surge into the country and of course that was an article on info wars.com
[01:57:17.980 --> 01:57:23.180]  from Curt Nimo and then look at this article we had a Swedish school killer
[01:57:23.180 --> 01:57:27.580]  posed for a photo midway through a murder spree now this is a guy goes into a
[01:57:27.580 --> 01:57:33.380]  school he doesn't have a gun but he's got a mask and a sword and he's chopping
[01:57:33.380 --> 01:57:37.820]  people up in the school but in between as he's going from classroom to classroom
[01:57:37.820 --> 01:57:41.820]  he stops and because he's got a mask and he's got a sword or some blood on the
[01:57:41.820 --> 01:57:46.260]  students thought that it was fake blood they thought it was kind of cool so they
[01:57:46.260 --> 01:57:50.460]  actually posed with him for pictures you know how they shot how they stopped
[01:57:50.460 --> 01:57:58.460]  this guy he was shot isn't that interesting maybe maybe we should have
[01:57:58.460 --> 01:58:03.740]  mask control and sword control right that's what the liberals would say isn't
[01:58:03.740 --> 01:58:08.300]  it interesting that he was stopped by someone with a gun he was stopped by the
[01:58:08.300 --> 01:58:14.220]  school police who shot him with a gun yeah see that's the whole point when
[01:58:14.220 --> 01:58:17.980]  you've got somebody who's got a sword or somebody who's just bigger than you are
[01:58:17.980 --> 01:58:22.340]  especially if you're a woman that's the way you equalize things is with a gun
[01:58:22.340 --> 01:58:27.260]  guns can be used to defend people not just to attack people that's what that
[01:58:27.260 --> 01:58:30.580]  situation in Sweden shows and we can see Cloward and Piven operating
[01:58:30.580 --> 01:58:33.820]  unfortunately throughout their society stay with us when we come back we're
[01:58:33.820 --> 01:58:36.660]  going to cover more news and we're going to talk about Bernie sand or these

[02:00:25.740 --> 02:00:31.860]  today again we have a couple of key articles Iceland has now sent 26 corrupt
[02:00:31.860 --> 02:00:36.660]  bankers to prison you'll find that on info wars.com as well as Silicon Valley
[02:00:36.660 --> 02:00:42.460]  experts use suggest using pop-ups to shame people who are making offensive
[02:00:42.460 --> 02:00:47.380]  posts hey did you know you're being racist right now things like that that's
[02:00:47.380 --> 02:00:54.180]  what they're wargaming and of course that is a part of the shaming society
[02:00:54.180 --> 02:00:58.540]  that's what makes people like Donald Trump so popular the fact that he's
[02:00:58.540 --> 02:01:02.460]  pushing it back against this kind of political correctness we all understand
[02:01:02.460 --> 02:01:07.820]  by now that it is a tool of social control we all understand by now that
[02:01:07.820 --> 02:01:12.220]  the computers are a tool of social control the internet is a tool of social
[02:01:12.220 --> 02:01:16.140]  control and we also need also need to understand that everything that we're
[02:01:16.140 --> 02:01:18.900]  doing just as these Silicon Valley experts are pointing out they are
[02:01:18.900 --> 02:01:22.140]  watching everything that you are typing everything that you're doing on the
[02:01:22.140 --> 02:01:25.700]  computer as you're doing it in real time that information is now going to be
[02:01:25.700 --> 02:01:33.180]  shared with the government the Senate passed CISA today 83 senators voted to
[02:01:33.180 --> 02:01:38.220]  approve information sharing and give legal protection to the corporations that
[02:01:38.220 --> 02:01:42.220]  turn your private information that they're collecting about you turn that
[02:01:42.220 --> 02:01:46.740]  over to the government without you being able to take any legal action against
[02:01:46.740 --> 02:01:52.380]  that so now it's been formalized Google Facebook all of them they are collecting
[02:01:52.380 --> 02:01:56.100]  information for the NSA they're collecting it for the government which
[02:01:56.100 --> 02:01:59.860]  will then take a look at it in the same kind of ways that these Silicon Valley
[02:01:59.860 --> 02:02:04.420]  experts are suggesting take a look at it and say well you know I think that I
[02:02:04.420 --> 02:02:09.420]  don't like what you're typing here so it may be a lot more insidious than a
[02:02:09.420 --> 02:02:14.580]  pop-up you may not get a pop-up on your screen what you may have is a pop-up of
[02:02:14.580 --> 02:02:18.300]  a SWAT team at your house because that's the way they're going to use this
[02:02:18.300 --> 02:02:22.620]  information that's what we need to be aware of you need to understand that
[02:02:22.620 --> 02:02:26.020]  when they talk about people who are being racist people who are they talk
[02:02:26.020 --> 02:02:30.860]  about being extremists people that they need to track using this information
[02:02:30.860 --> 02:02:34.900]  sharing they're going to track radical extremists and when people in America
[02:02:34.900 --> 02:02:39.180]  look at that they say oh you mean those radical jihadis who want to chop people's
[02:02:39.180 --> 02:02:43.300]  heads off it's like no no not really that's not the way it's being used in
[02:02:43.300 --> 02:02:50.260]  Europe we just had a week or two ago the strong cities network announced at the
[02:02:50.260 --> 02:02:53.820]  United Nations along with the Department of Justice and the current
[02:02:53.820 --> 02:02:57.980]  Attorney General and that's coming out of Europe it's coming from a think tank
[02:02:57.980 --> 02:03:01.380]  in Europe they're going to be the ones who are going to be monitoring that and
[02:03:01.380 --> 02:03:06.500]  they're going to be looking at what they call dangerous radical extremists and
[02:03:06.500 --> 02:03:10.060]  let me under let me tell you who they think the dangerous radical extremists
[02:03:10.060 --> 02:03:14.060]  are straight out of the Southern Poverty Law Center playbook except it's coming
[02:03:14.060 --> 02:03:20.580]  from Europe there it's anybody who is anti-immigration anti-Islam see when
[02:03:20.580 --> 02:03:24.900]  they're talking about radical extremists they're not talking about the people who
[02:03:24.900 --> 02:03:29.060]  run around chopping heads off no the radical extremists are the people who
[02:03:29.060 --> 02:03:34.340]  are afraid or concerned about that that's what they're going to be using this
[02:03:34.340 --> 02:03:37.700]  for that's what the strong cities network is about that the United Nations is
[02:03:37.700 --> 02:03:44.660]  targeting people who are opposed to the open borders like Paul Ryan and Obama
[02:03:44.660 --> 02:03:49.340]  and Boehner and Pelosi and the rest of them are feeding us and of course we
[02:03:49.340 --> 02:03:53.220]  can include in that group Bernie Sanders Bernie Sanders has just hired a
[02:03:53.220 --> 02:03:59.020]  dreamer as one of his what the person who's going to be doing the outreach to
[02:03:59.020 --> 02:04:04.700]  Hispanic voters this is a person who came here he's an illegal immigrant he
[02:04:04.700 --> 02:04:09.060]  is a dreamer he helped to organize the dream organizations he went to school in
[02:04:09.060 --> 02:04:13.300]  New York and he went to pass the bar and they said wait a minute you can't you
[02:04:13.300 --> 02:04:16.980]  can't be on the bar here in New York you're not a citizen and then they
[02:04:16.980 --> 02:04:20.540]  thought better about it and they said now this alright you don't have to be you
[02:04:20.540 --> 02:04:24.220]  know I have to actually respect the law in New York to be a lawyer so now we
[02:04:24.220 --> 02:04:27.900]  formalize that we all kind of we all kind of suspected that didn't weigh
[02:04:27.900 --> 02:04:31.860]  anybody that kind of dealings with legal system but they formalize that and
[02:04:31.860 --> 02:04:36.740]  said no you can be a lawyer and have absolutely no respect for whatever laws
[02:04:36.740 --> 02:04:41.300]  you don't like so they made him part of the bar he then helped to set up the
[02:04:41.300 --> 02:04:47.580]  dreamers group and now he is going to be Bernie Sanders outreach to Latino
[02:04:47.580 --> 02:04:51.020]  voters stay with us when we come back we're going to talk about Bernie
[02:04:51.020 --> 02:04:58.780]  Sander Nista and his outreach to the Nicaraguans we'll be right back after
[02:04:58.780 --> 02:05:02.940]  the release of numerous videos showing questionable Planned Parenthood practices
[02:05:02.940 --> 02:05:07.860]  multiple facilities have been rated Reuters reports Texas officials rated
[02:05:07.860 --> 02:05:11.700]  several Planned Parenthood facilities on Thursday and a move that comes days
[02:05:11.700 --> 02:05:15.740]  after the state Republican leaders bar the women's health group from receiving
[02:05:15.740 --> 02:05:20.100]  state Medicaid money the inspector general's office declined to comment but
[02:05:20.100 --> 02:05:23.700]  its agents were seen on local news reports entering a Planned Parenthood
[02:05:23.700 --> 02:05:27.700]  facility in San Antonio Texas said it would launch a probe of Planned
[02:05:27.700 --> 02:05:32.340]  Parenthood after the release of videos in July by anti-abortion activist group
[02:05:32.340 --> 02:05:36.260]  center for medical progress in which a Planned Parenthood official is seen
[02:05:36.260 --> 02:05:41.140]  talking about transactions involving fetal tissue and speaking on a personal
[02:05:41.140 --> 02:05:45.100]  note Planned Parenthood continues to say that the videos were edited which they
[02:05:45.100 --> 02:05:49.380]  were much like you would edit a state of a union address down to a few sound
[02:05:49.380 --> 02:05:53.260]  bites but that doesn't mean that they were taken out of context you can find

[02:08:14.780 --> 02:08:19.780]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm David Knight on this October 23rd 2015.
[02:08:19.780 --> 02:08:24.700]  I'll be your host today and again in the fourth hour we're going to have a Planned
[02:08:24.700 --> 02:08:30.220]  Parenthood whistleblower Abby Johnson join us in the fourth hour we just had
[02:08:30.220 --> 02:08:35.780]  Planned Parenthood get very concerned they tried to stop the raw footage from
[02:08:35.780 --> 02:08:39.460]  being released remember they said that the footage from the Planned Parenthood
[02:08:39.460 --> 02:08:45.660]  clinics showing them conspiring to get baby parts conspiring to do partial birth
[02:08:45.660 --> 02:08:48.660]  abortions they said oh that's heavily edited that's not really true that's
[02:08:48.660 --> 02:08:51.700]  dishonest well the House committee that was investigating it because they're
[02:08:51.700 --> 02:08:56.300]  looking at possibly cutting the funding for this kind of activity they said
[02:08:56.300 --> 02:09:01.660]  send us the raw footage so this abortion group the this federation this
[02:09:01.660 --> 02:09:06.420]  abortion federation said we are going to stop you they got an injunction to
[02:09:06.420 --> 02:09:12.420]  stop that from being released to the public nevertheless it was leaked by a
[02:09:12.420 --> 02:09:18.900]  staffer you would think that if it really was heavily edited that they would
[02:09:18.900 --> 02:09:22.340]  want that to get out wouldn't you but actually what it's going to show is
[02:09:22.340 --> 02:09:26.340]  probably something that is even far worse as people take a look at it and
[02:09:26.340 --> 02:09:30.780]  in spite of the fact that they got an injunction they still had a conservative
[02:09:30.780 --> 02:09:34.180]  news site put that out saying I'm not going to have an injunctioning that's
[02:09:34.180 --> 02:09:38.580]  going to be a prior restraint of my first amendment rights good for him also
[02:09:38.580 --> 02:09:43.220]  breaking in news on info wars.com Iceland has now sent 26 corrupt bankers to
[02:09:43.220 --> 02:09:47.780]  prison 74 years of sentences and this is for high-level people this is not
[02:09:47.780 --> 02:09:52.100]  people at the bottom they say this brings to 26 bankers now behind bars in
[02:09:52.100 --> 02:09:57.700]  Iceland with most being CEOs of large financial institutions rather than low
[02:09:57.700 --> 02:10:02.660]  level traders. Let me read you what Iceland's president said he said why
[02:10:02.660 --> 02:10:07.620]  are banks considered to be the holy churches of the modern economy why are
[02:10:07.620 --> 02:10:11.420]  private banks not like airlines and telecommunication companies and allowed
[02:10:11.420 --> 02:10:15.740]  to go bankrupt if they've been run in an irresponsible way the theory that you
[02:10:15.740 --> 02:10:22.260]  have to bail out banks is a theory that you allow bankers to enjoy is a theory
[02:10:22.260 --> 02:10:26.140]  that you allow bankers to enjoy for their own profit for their own success then
[02:10:26.140 --> 02:10:30.940]  you let ordinary people bear their failure through taxes and austerity.
[02:10:30.940 --> 02:10:35.900]  People in enlightened democracies are not going to accept that in the long run
[02:10:35.900 --> 02:10:39.620]  and then he added we were wise enough talking about Iceland we were wise
[02:10:39.620 --> 02:10:44.060]  enough not to follow the traditional prevailing orthodoxies of the Western
[02:10:44.060 --> 02:10:47.820]  financial world in the last 30 years we introduced currency controls we let
[02:10:47.820 --> 02:10:52.540]  banks fail we provided support for the poor we didn't introduce austerity
[02:10:52.540 --> 02:10:57.620]  measures like you're seeing in Europe but again in this article I point out
[02:10:57.620 --> 02:11:02.940]  Congress gave American banks a $700 billion bailout that was tarp remember
[02:11:02.940 --> 02:11:10.500]  that do you remember when the Obama administration gave a pass to HSBC when
[02:11:10.500 --> 02:11:14.500]  they were caught money laundering after they had been a four second time that
[02:11:14.500 --> 02:11:17.700]  already been put on probation being caught doing it they caught him a second
[02:11:17.700 --> 02:11:21.860]  time they gave him a small slap on the wrist a very small fine that amounted
[02:11:21.860 --> 02:11:25.700]  to a couple of days profits a few days profits but of course they said at the
[02:11:25.700 --> 02:11:29.580]  time it wouldn't really do us any good to pull this bank's charter and it
[02:11:29.580 --> 02:11:33.060]  wouldn't be in the public interest to do that we wouldn't want to put anybody in
[02:11:33.060 --> 02:11:35.900]  jail for that that wouldn't be in the public interest and everybody said oh
[02:11:35.900 --> 02:11:41.780]  and Eric Holder's Department of Justice in the Obama administration bankers are
[02:11:41.780 --> 02:11:46.820]  too big to jail they're not only too big to fail like we saw with tarp but they're
[02:11:46.820 --> 02:11:53.380]  too big to jail and we subsequently learned that HSBC even had its own
[02:11:53.380 --> 02:11:58.540]  dedicated window for money laundering for the Sinaloa cartel remember all this
[02:11:58.540 --> 02:12:03.100]  panic about El Chapo escaping from prison he was the guy who was head of the
[02:12:03.100 --> 02:12:10.540]  Sinaloa cartel and HSBC gave them their own private window to launder money
[02:12:10.540 --> 02:12:14.380]  nothing in the United States to be done about that and of course let's understand
[02:12:14.380 --> 02:12:17.740]  that the Republicans aren't going to be any better this is not something that is
[02:12:17.740 --> 02:12:24.380]  simply an Obama administration issue yes Eric Holder had his position with his
[02:12:24.380 --> 02:12:28.540]  his cronies and on Wall Street they kept his desk for him and he went right back
[02:12:28.540 --> 02:12:32.260]  to the law firm that worked for these big banks yes I know that's true but it's
[02:12:32.260 --> 02:12:36.860]  also true on the Republican side as well they're not going to put these guys in
[02:12:36.860 --> 02:12:42.100]  jail but they did in Iceland and that's the way you stop it see if you don't
[02:12:42.100 --> 02:12:47.300]  prosecute the bad people whether they're people in the NSA or whether they're
[02:12:47.300 --> 02:12:50.540]  people in the State Department like Hillary Clinton or whether they're the
[02:12:50.540 --> 02:12:55.260]  big bankers if you don't when people break the law if you don't punish them if
[02:12:55.260 --> 02:13:00.860]  you don't purge that out of the system the system owns it the system itself
[02:13:00.860 --> 02:13:05.980]  becomes corrupt and that's the problem that we have now we have massive massive
[02:13:05.980 --> 02:13:11.220]  corruption in the United States because of the people at top who are allowing
[02:13:11.220 --> 02:13:15.380]  this who are enabling this because they will not take any action against people
[02:13:15.380 --> 02:13:19.420]  fortunately in Iceland they are doing it and one of the reasons that works is
[02:13:19.420 --> 02:13:23.940]  because it's a small country because the government is closer to the people and
[02:13:23.940 --> 02:13:29.660]  again if we're going to continue to think that we are going to reform
[02:13:29.660 --> 02:13:34.340]  Washington from the inside I think that is delusional it is going to have to be
[02:13:34.340 --> 02:13:38.740]  done from the outside if it's done at all it may be too late to get it done but
[02:13:38.740 --> 02:13:43.060]  we have to try to cut it off on the outside we have to try to get control of
[02:13:43.060 --> 02:13:48.260]  the smaller controllable blocks and exercise our constitutional authority
[02:13:48.260 --> 02:13:55.660]  now I want to talk about Bernie Sanders and this 1985 video that has surfaced
[02:13:55.660 --> 02:13:59.860]  about him going to South America before I do real quickly I want to let you know
[02:13:59.860 --> 02:14:04.220]  that we have 15% off of ancient defense for a limited time right now at info

[02:14:34.080 --> 02:14:36.980]  kind of results that they've gotten here's a couple for ancient defense
[02:14:36.980 --> 02:14:41.340]  KK and Burbank California said I'm a disabled combat veteran I've been getting
[02:14:41.340 --> 02:14:45.740]  good results since you started selling this supplement another one is Billy Bob
[02:14:45.740 --> 02:14:51.580]  from Ponce PR I'm not sure where that private I'm not sure where PR is but
[02:14:51.580 --> 02:14:55.420]  anyway Puerto Rico that's Puerto Rico says I've tried many so-called products
[02:14:55.420 --> 02:15:00.060]  for years none of the others are as pure and as strong as ancient defense so
[02:15:00.060 --> 02:15:04.020]  again you can take a look at the reviews on our sites for all of our products and
[02:15:04.020 --> 02:15:10.740]  again ancient defense is 15% off at info warslife.com now as we're
[02:15:10.740 --> 02:15:14.620]  talking about the bankers ignoring the laws and getting away with it as we're
[02:15:14.620 --> 02:15:19.860]  talking about them being able to rig the LIBOR market being able to launder
[02:15:19.860 --> 02:15:25.940]  money for drug dealers for terrorist organizations as HSBC was doing and
[02:15:25.940 --> 02:15:29.860]  get away with it because they're too big to jail that is a kind of corruption
[02:15:29.860 --> 02:15:34.340]  that destroys the country but it's also a kind of corruption that can destroy the
[02:15:34.340 --> 02:15:39.820]  country at the bottom level as well if we ignore the law at every level then it
[02:15:39.820 --> 02:15:43.440]  really does destroy the country a good example of this I think is Bernie
[02:15:43.440 --> 02:15:48.060]  Sanders new campaign manager one of his not campaign manager but his outreach
[02:15:48.060 --> 02:15:54.700]  manager to the Latino vote this is someone whose name is Cesar Vargas he
[02:15:54.700 --> 02:16:00.500]  is an illegal alien who went to school and became a lawyer got a law degree in
[02:16:00.500 --> 02:16:03.700]  New York and then he applied for the bar and they said no you can't be a lawyer
[02:16:03.700 --> 02:16:09.100]  in New York you're not a citizen in New York and you have thumbed your nose at
[02:16:09.100 --> 02:16:13.220]  the immigration laws then your entire life not applied to become a citizen
[02:16:13.220 --> 02:16:16.740]  you're not tried to follow the rules when it comes to that why should we let
[02:16:16.740 --> 02:16:22.740]  you be a lawyer well he said that's racist I guess whatever he told them
[02:16:22.740 --> 02:16:29.900]  they then repeal that and they admitted him to the bar here's a guy who is not
[02:16:29.900 --> 02:16:35.900]  even a legal citizen but they admitted him to the bar so when you own that kind
[02:16:35.900 --> 02:16:40.420]  of corruption it shows itself in many different ways this is another way for
[02:16:40.420 --> 02:16:44.740]  example amnesty beneficiaries could claim more than $35,000 in tax
[02:16:44.740 --> 02:16:47.640]  benefits in the first year remember the story from earlier this year in
[02:16:47.640 --> 02:16:53.500]  Breitbart this is all the way back in February and that was the IRS saying you
[02:16:53.500 --> 02:16:57.620]  know we're going to let you file for previous years and they don't really
[02:16:57.620 --> 02:17:03.220]  follow that too closely they documented this article massive instances of fraud
[02:17:03.220 --> 02:17:07.620]  have been documented by people filing false claims but essentially what that
[02:17:07.620 --> 02:17:11.860]  does is offer financial incentive for people to come here from outside of the
[02:17:11.860 --> 02:17:15.860]  country say not only can you come here but we're going to give you 30 up to
[02:17:15.860 --> 02:17:23.180]  $35,000 and back tax benefits just file some paperwork and you'll be able to
[02:17:23.180 --> 02:17:27.180]  vote you can vote for Hillary or Bernie depending on which one of them you like
[02:17:27.180 --> 02:17:33.340]  I guess and that's the way you take down countries because you cannot keep the
[02:17:33.340 --> 02:17:37.780]  country running if you have an entitlement program and open borders either
[02:17:37.780 --> 02:17:41.900]  one of those can destroy a country both of them together will destroy a country
[02:17:41.900 --> 02:17:47.580]  very quickly and you know earlier in the show we were talking about the SISBA
[02:17:47.580 --> 02:17:53.260]  right passing in the Senate Bernie Sanders to his credit was one of only
[02:17:53.260 --> 02:17:59.660]  the two only two senators running for president that worked against SISA the
[02:17:59.660 --> 02:18:03.980]  other being Rand Paul I agree with Bernie Sanders on that and I agree with
[02:18:03.980 --> 02:18:08.180]  what he said when he went to Nicaragua about our foreign policy remember what
[02:18:08.180 --> 02:18:11.500]  was happening at the time we had Iran Contra we had Ronald Reagan and Oliver
[02:18:11.500 --> 02:18:16.780]  North selling weapon parts to Iran because they had our state-of-the-art
[02:18:16.780 --> 02:18:20.540]  fighter jets they needed spare parts so they were secretly selling them parts
[02:18:20.540 --> 02:18:26.620]  using that money to run a covert war that they didn't want to get congressional
[02:18:26.620 --> 02:18:31.100]  approval from in Central America running a war against the Sandinistas the
[02:18:31.100 --> 02:18:37.220]  communists in Nicaragua also funding that by running the crack cocaine trade
[02:18:37.220 --> 02:18:44.780]  that Gary Webb exposed and Dark Alliance so that was a lot of very evil
[02:18:44.780 --> 02:18:50.780]  policies by the Reagan administration by the CIA by Oliver North and at the time
[02:18:50.780 --> 02:18:54.860]  as this stuff was starting to come out people like Bernie Sanders were very
[02:18:54.860 --> 02:18:58.260]  upset about that many other people that weren't socialists were upset about that
[02:18:58.260 --> 02:19:04.060]  but just because these guys were acting as criminals doesn't mean that the
[02:19:04.060 --> 02:19:09.580]  Sandinistas were good guys either they were horrible as a matter of fact the
[02:19:09.580 --> 02:19:14.860]  guy that Bernie goes down to take a look at eventually is driven out of office by
[02:19:14.860 --> 02:19:20.740]  a coalition of libertarians conservatives and communists the communists
[02:19:20.740 --> 02:19:26.980]  even threw him out when he was taken out of office Daniel Ortega at the beginning
[02:19:26.980 --> 02:19:31.180]  of his communist revolution had taken a lot of private property they'd taken
[02:19:31.180 --> 02:19:35.420]  billions of dollars worth of private property from individual individuals as
[02:19:35.420 --> 02:19:40.860]  well as corporations days before he left office being thrown out by even
[02:19:40.860 --> 02:19:45.020]  communists he decided that taking private property wasn't a good idea he was
[02:19:45.020 --> 02:19:50.140]  going to make it private again except it became his private property his and
[02:19:50.140 --> 02:19:53.380]  his fellow conspirators when we come back we're going to look at what Bernie
[02:19:53.380 --> 02:19:58.420]  Sandinista said about Daniel Ortega
[02:19:58.420 --> 02:20:04.300]  Newmana the true pioneer of healthy storable foods and preparedness products

[02:24:06.340 --> 02:24:10.900]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight I want to play for you this
[02:24:10.900 --> 02:24:16.740]  clip that surfaced from 30 years ago Bernie Sandernista who went to Nicaragua
[02:24:16.740 --> 02:24:21.820]  and this is his impression of the Sandernista's let's play this clip and
[02:24:21.820 --> 02:24:25.940]  we'll comment on it as a socialist the word socialism does not frighten me and
[02:24:25.940 --> 02:24:28.900]  I think it's probably fair to say that the Nicaraguan government is primarily
[02:24:28.900 --> 02:24:33.500]  a socialist government how do you find the sincerity of Sandernista leaders I
[02:24:33.500 --> 02:24:37.620]  was impressed now obviously I will be attacked by every editorial writer in
[02:24:37.620 --> 02:24:44.140]  the free press for being a dumb duke maybe I am I was impressed by their
[02:24:44.140 --> 02:24:47.380]  intelligence and by their sincerity these are not political hacks you know
[02:24:47.380 --> 02:24:52.300]  these are not political hacks you know yeah they're not political and he's
[02:24:52.300 --> 02:24:55.900]  going to tell you how he knows they're not political hacks I'm gonna play this
[02:24:55.900 --> 02:25:01.980]  next clip for you and it basically boils down to the way Bernie Sanders
[02:25:01.980 --> 02:25:07.140]  identifies with these people and I have to tell you that that's what's behind the
[02:25:07.140 --> 02:25:12.300]  support for Bernie Sanders people who like Bernie Sanders because he seems to
[02:25:12.300 --> 02:25:16.620]  be like them they're not looking at his policies they're not looking at what the
[02:25:16.620 --> 02:25:20.620]  policies have done to places like Nicaragua that he thought was such a
[02:25:20.620 --> 02:25:24.580]  great idea 30 years on we can see what happened in that country it's got a long
[02:25:24.580 --> 02:25:28.140]  history we can look at how socialism failed there we can look at how it failed
[02:25:28.140 --> 02:25:32.780]  in the Soviet Union in China everywhere else that it's been tried but of course
[02:25:32.780 --> 02:25:36.940]  it's going to be different now Bernie calls it democratic socialism but let's
[02:25:36.940 --> 02:25:41.340]  play the rest of this clip about how he knows that these people are not political
[02:25:41.340 --> 02:25:45.940]  hacks I was impressed by Father of the Scoto and and if he is a very gentle
[02:25:45.940 --> 02:25:49.180]  very loving man he's familiar with Burlington for money had a niece who
[02:25:49.180 --> 02:25:53.140]  graduated he knows me he knows he's from Vermont actually who's now working for
[02:25:53.140 --> 02:25:59.820]  the guy and he's gentle what Tega is an impressive guy Ernesto Cardinal is a
[02:25:59.820 --> 02:26:03.340]  funny-looking guy he's gray hair and he really does remind you of a hippie I
[02:26:03.340 --> 02:26:11.380]  mean Ernesto and in fact you know we talk he's very strongly in the poetry he
[02:26:11.380 --> 02:26:15.860]  is very proud of the fact that they are now teaching poetry not only the
[02:26:15.860 --> 02:26:20.500]  peasants and the workers but in the in the military in the police department a
[02:26:20.500 --> 02:26:25.140]  very impressive guy yeah yeah you know he's got this white he's kind of like a
[02:26:25.140 --> 02:26:29.660]  hippie you know he's kind of like Bernie Sanders 30 years later kind of like
[02:26:29.660 --> 02:26:34.640]  doc from back to the future except he hasn't been to the future he hasn't
[02:26:34.640 --> 02:26:40.220]  learned anything in the past 30 years unlike doc okay we're still using the
[02:26:40.220 --> 02:26:43.860]  same old playbook and the amazing thing about it is you hear what he said about
[02:26:43.860 --> 02:26:47.740]  poetry you know these guys are great I mean he's an old guy you know he's a
[02:26:47.740 --> 02:26:54.100]  gentleman he looks like a hippie there's a somebody that I know that's went to
[02:26:54.100 --> 02:26:57.340]  school in Vermont that's working for him all of this is about personal
[02:26:57.340 --> 02:27:02.460]  identification there's absolutely no discernment about the policies that are
[02:27:02.460 --> 02:27:06.780]  there and of course Daniel Ortega as I mentioned in the last segment he did a
[02:27:06.780 --> 02:27:11.940]  massive is basically a massive kleptocracy wasn't even about socialism
[02:27:11.940 --> 02:27:16.420]  I mean he was he wasn't a political hack okay he was thrown out by not only
[02:27:16.420 --> 02:27:20.500]  conservatives but Kong a communist who threw him out of the government there
[02:27:20.500 --> 02:27:26.660]  in Nicaragua and look at his ally that he made common cause with the other
[02:27:26.660 --> 02:27:31.620]  revolutions in Central America look at Venezuela Hugo Chavez remember it's
[02:27:31.620 --> 02:27:34.900]  about a year ago that Bloomberg was bragging about the fact that Wall
[02:27:34.900 --> 02:27:38.180]  Street the people that Bernie Sanders loves to talk about Bernie Sanders will
[02:27:38.180 --> 02:27:42.500]  talk about Wall Street but he won't talk about the Federal Reserve but when he
[02:27:42.500 --> 02:27:46.060]  talks about Wall Street he doesn't mention the fact that Hugo Chavez's
[02:27:46.060 --> 02:27:52.460]  communist socialist Venezuela paradise that he loved so much gave 700% return
[02:27:52.460 --> 02:27:56.140]  on investment to the Wall Street bankers and they were bragging on Bloomberg
[02:27:56.140 --> 02:28:00.980]  about how these guys these guys here they understand that their first
[02:28:00.980 --> 02:28:05.220]  responsibility is to the bankers to their sovereign debt to the bankers
[02:28:05.220 --> 02:28:09.420]  that's why the people have to go to another country to get food water and
[02:28:09.420 --> 02:28:12.780]  medicine that was in the very same article that they're talking about the
[02:28:12.780 --> 02:28:17.100]  fact that they are giving them a 700% return on investment in that same
[02:28:17.100 --> 02:28:22.020]  Bloomberg article they're talking about the privation of the people that is
[02:28:22.020 --> 02:28:26.060]  socialism eventually you run out of other people's money eventually you run
[02:28:26.060 --> 02:28:31.420]  out of the lies and 30 years on Bernie Sanders still can't see this he was
[02:28:31.420 --> 02:28:35.980]  infatuated by these guys because they look like hippies they taught poetry I
[02:28:35.980 --> 02:28:41.220]  mean we're laughing about this my son Travis who works here he said that yeah
[02:28:41.220 --> 02:28:45.740]  it makes me feel better if the police are can can spout poetry to me while
[02:28:45.740 --> 02:28:48.780]  they're beating me you know for their communist revolution I mean the police
[02:28:48.780 --> 02:28:53.820]  and the military were being taught poetry by this guy I'm sure that it was
[02:28:53.820 --> 02:28:59.380]  mandatory just like Mao's cultural revolution that's precisely the problem
[02:28:59.380 --> 02:29:03.340]  let's look at some of the economic policies as well we're told that we're
[02:29:03.340 --> 02:29:07.300]  going to solve all this by increasing the minimum wage well you know we have
[02:29:07.300 --> 02:29:12.780]  this article here goodbye middle classes by Michael Schneider 51% of all
[02:29:12.780 --> 02:29:18.660]  American workers make less than $30,000 a year 38% of them make less than 20,000
[02:29:18.660 --> 02:29:23.660]  a year when you look at things like the Obamacare mandate everything for the
[02:29:23.660 --> 02:29:27.940]  Bernie Sanders socialists is anti-choice everything is a mandate
[02:29:27.940 --> 02:29:31.900]  everything must be run by government including things like health care and so
[02:29:31.900 --> 02:29:36.700]  what they do is they charge the poorest people not a 2.5% penalty but they
[02:29:36.700 --> 02:29:41.060]  charge the people making minimum wage a 5% penalty stay with us we'll be right
[02:29:41.060 --> 02:29:54.060]  back we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[02:29:54.060 --> 02:29:56.620]  network
[02:29:58.060 --> 02:30:02.100]  Hillary Clinton will testify in front of the Benghazi committee and of course
[02:30:02.100 --> 02:30:06.340]  she's gonna try and spin this as just partisan politics but let's look at the
[02:30:06.340 --> 02:30:10.980]  facts they lied one of the first moves the Obama administration made after
[02:30:10.980 --> 02:30:15.100]  the Benghazi attack was to contact YouTube in an apparent attempt to blame
[02:30:15.100 --> 02:30:19.060]  the attack on an obscure pastor John video this is according to state
[02:30:19.060 --> 02:30:23.140]  department documents obtained by judicial watch later the administration
[02:30:23.140 --> 02:30:26.460]  famously claimed the attack was provoked by another YouTube video
[02:30:26.460 --> 02:30:30.980]  innocence of Muslims made by an Egyptian-born filmmaker while they were
[02:30:30.980 --> 02:30:35.620]  plotting an enormous lie on the public former Navy SEAL David Ubin was still
[02:30:35.620 --> 02:30:40.020]  trapped on the roof of the Benghazi annex for 20 hours the Obama
[02:30:40.020 --> 02:30:43.980]  administration later jailed the filmmaker behind innocence of Muslims in
[02:30:43.980 --> 02:30:47.460]  fact he was the only man who's been captured and imprisoned in the
[02:30:47.460 --> 02:30:51.780]  aftermath of the Benghazi terrorist attack what difference at this point

[02:33:03.540 --> 02:33:14.740]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the Alex Jones show welcome
[02:33:14.740 --> 02:33:18.420]  back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight your host you may have been
[02:33:18.420 --> 02:33:23.900]  following Leanne McAdoo she just began a liver flush and she's been posting some
[02:33:23.900 --> 02:33:27.420]  videos about her experience with that as well as some information about some
[02:33:27.420 --> 02:33:33.620]  recipes that she's using to make her healthier she's pretty good shape but
[02:33:33.620 --> 02:33:39.020]  she's getting healthier we had Dr. Group in talking to Alex Jones recently about
[02:33:39.020 --> 02:33:43.060]  liver shield which can help you with that process here's a video of that
[02:33:43.060 --> 02:33:46.900]  interview some excerpts from that interview
[02:33:54.420 --> 02:34:00.620]  and when you eat all these toxins if you ate McDonald's nuggets 20 years ago
[02:34:00.620 --> 02:34:06.780]  that had plasticizers in them your gallbladder and your liver doesn't know
[02:34:06.780 --> 02:34:09.980]  what to do so the liver basically excretes that into the gallbladder and
[02:34:09.980 --> 02:34:16.500]  it holds it just Google gallbladder stones and it's disgusting but you need
[02:34:16.500 --> 02:34:21.820]  to look at it and when you finally get filled up with these it burst or it gets
[02:34:21.820 --> 02:34:26.180]  infected they've got to remove it and we'll scroll through these there's even
[02:34:26.180 --> 02:34:30.860]  grosser ones like let's scroll down on average they're green or black if they're
[02:34:30.860 --> 02:34:37.740]  black they're really old and toxic they're generally green and this stuff's
[02:34:37.740 --> 02:34:43.260]  meant to be passed out of you but we eat such artificial food that it doesn't
[02:34:43.260 --> 02:34:49.780]  these are way beyond kidney stones you name it you also have liver stones and
[02:34:49.780 --> 02:34:54.540]  medical doctors won't tell you on average hey flush your liver they'll just say
[02:34:54.540 --> 02:34:58.100]  hey your liver's sick it's gonna get progressively worse we're gonna get you
[02:34:58.100 --> 02:35:04.140]  on a list for a liver transplant it is unbelievable we're showing these
[02:35:04.140 --> 02:35:08.020]  disgusting images so about a year and a half ago Anthony Goosey already just
[02:35:08.020 --> 02:35:12.180]  said man I just have a doctor grips liver cleanse the one he recommends and
[02:35:12.180 --> 02:35:16.740]  he's developing this proprietary stuff he's testing on himself right now you
[02:35:16.740 --> 02:35:22.060]  really got to do it the results are dramatic after six days and I'm like no
[02:35:22.060 --> 02:35:26.180]  way no way I'm doing it I don't believe that there's giant black or green balls
[02:35:26.180 --> 02:35:31.100]  in my gallbladder I'm this how ignorant I am how does the apple cider vinegar
[02:35:31.100 --> 02:35:36.460]  organic with the oxy powder and with the liver trucks over to six day cleanse how
[02:35:36.460 --> 02:35:40.420]  does it then when you take the olive oil at the end lay on your side for an hour
[02:35:40.420 --> 02:35:44.900]  as you go to sleep why does it then have the gallbladder release what you
[02:35:44.900 --> 02:35:49.780]  should do and this is what our proprietary research led us to do back
[02:35:49.780 --> 02:35:54.380]  starting in the early 90s when we were looking at the best ways to cleanse the
[02:35:54.380 --> 02:35:59.540]  liver was to develop an herbal formula that contains herbs that will help
[02:35:59.540 --> 02:36:04.100]  soften or break down these globules or these stones in the liver and the gall
[02:36:04.100 --> 02:36:08.740]  bladder and that's really what the first five days is for that's where you mix
[02:36:08.740 --> 02:36:12.260]  the bottle of liver shield you pour the whole bottle in a gallon of distilled
[02:36:12.260 --> 02:36:18.500]  water and then you drink four eight ounce glasses a day of that for five days at
[02:36:18.500 --> 02:36:22.340]  the same time though you're also using the apple cider vinegar and that's gonna
[02:36:22.340 --> 02:36:28.860]  be the the liver flush kit that we put together exclusively for info wars you
[02:36:28.860 --> 02:36:34.220]  know viewers and the people that want to support the you know the info war so
[02:36:34.220 --> 02:36:37.540]  basically that you want you to do that for five days and of course you want to
[02:36:37.540 --> 02:36:40.420]  eat fairly healthy you don't want to be putting a bunch of chemicals and toxins
[02:36:40.420 --> 02:36:46.060]  into your body but then on day five is when you actually do the olive oil and
[02:36:46.060 --> 02:36:50.780]  when you you do epsom salts and the epsom salts that you drink will
[02:36:50.780 --> 02:36:58.020]  actually help relax the the bile duct and make it a lot more elastic so any of
[02:36:58.020 --> 02:37:03.420]  the stones can pass through there or the globules the toxic globules and then
[02:37:03.420 --> 02:37:07.620]  when you lay on your you drink the olive oil you lay on your right side where
[02:37:07.620 --> 02:37:12.380]  because your liver is on the right side and those or that heavy oil ends up
[02:37:12.380 --> 02:37:16.140]  absorbing down through your intestinal lining and going into the liver and it
[02:37:16.140 --> 02:37:20.980]  kind of works like oil pulling which is a big thing now it was on Dr. Ross with
[02:37:20.980 --> 02:37:25.660]  the coconut oil where you swish it in your mouth and oil has an affinity for
[02:37:25.660 --> 02:37:30.140]  toxic substances and absorbs some of those and when you do the liver cleanse
[02:37:30.140 --> 02:37:36.580]  you will actually form also little oil globulates as well so the reason why you
[02:37:36.580 --> 02:37:41.540]  take during the ox the flush the liver flush the reason why you take oxy powder
[02:37:41.540 --> 02:37:45.540]  at the same time is because you want to be able to flush that out of the system
[02:37:45.540 --> 02:37:50.500]  because when the liver dumps all those toxic balls and rocks and all that toxic
[02:37:50.500 --> 02:37:53.740]  buildup that's been in there for years and years and years you want to have
[02:37:53.740 --> 02:37:58.740]  something to flush it out of the intestines again liver shield is now

[02:38:52.940 --> 02:38:57.860]  wars life.com now as we were talking about in the last segment of course
[02:38:57.860 --> 02:39:05.060]  Bernie Sandronista being in love with the socialism that he saw down in
[02:39:05.060 --> 02:39:09.580]  Nicaragua loving it I think largely because he said you know these guys
[02:39:09.580 --> 02:39:15.300]  are not hacks they look like me I mean they're poets they do they do
[02:39:15.300 --> 02:39:19.180]  poetry and and they're kind of like hippies so you know these are good guys
[02:39:19.180 --> 02:39:25.260]  these are authentic guys and making the mistake I think of hard core falling for
[02:39:25.260 --> 02:39:30.180]  this left-right paradigm that just because our foreign policy in Nicaragua
[02:39:30.180 --> 02:39:34.380]  was abhorrent and I agree with Bernie Sanders on that we talked about that the
[02:39:34.380 --> 02:39:39.620]  Iran-Contra situation the crack cocaine war that was coming in exposed by Gary
[02:39:39.620 --> 02:39:43.580]  Webb and Dark Alliance yes that was very evil but that doesn't make the
[02:39:43.580 --> 02:39:48.620]  Sandinistas good guys they were horrible guys there weren't two good groups the
[02:39:48.620 --> 02:39:54.380]  Contras were bad and so were the Sandinistas yet 30 years later Bernie
[02:39:54.380 --> 02:39:58.940]  Sanders hasn't learned anything still pushing this left-right paradigm many of
[02:39:58.940 --> 02:40:03.020]  his followers are still following in that left-right paradigm just because they
[02:40:03.020 --> 02:40:07.700]  don't like policies by the Republicans that means that Bernie and the
[02:40:07.700 --> 02:40:12.220]  diametrically opposed socialists must be right no it's not right when you're
[02:40:12.220 --> 02:40:17.580]  going to go in and say we're going to all become wealthy by increasing the
[02:40:17.580 --> 02:40:22.460]  minimum wage for the poorest people first of all we know what happens when
[02:40:22.460 --> 02:40:27.540]  you increase minimum wage it has a it trickles through the system it creates
[02:40:27.540 --> 02:40:32.980]  inflation it does not create more wealth any more than quantitative easing
[02:40:32.980 --> 02:40:37.460]  creates more wealth it's essentially quantitative easing for those people who
[02:40:37.460 --> 02:40:40.780]  are part of the working class but as I also pointed out just before we went to
[02:40:40.780 --> 02:40:46.780]  break their policies of mandates and everything boils down to a mandate the
[02:40:46.780 --> 02:40:51.420]  only thing Democrats are pro-choice on Democrats like Bernie Sanders and
[02:40:51.420 --> 02:40:54.780]  Hillary Clinton the only thing that they're pro-choice on is your choice to
[02:40:54.780 --> 02:40:58.060]  kill your children how they're going to be schooled whether or not they're
[02:40:58.060 --> 02:41:02.380]  going to get vaccines how they're going to get health insurance all of that is
[02:41:02.380 --> 02:41:06.700]  mandated and to be run eventually by the government and a good example of it are
[02:41:06.700 --> 02:41:11.780]  these penalties that are going up it's going to be 695 dollars or two and a
[02:41:11.780 --> 02:41:14.980]  half percent of your income now understand that works out to be about
[02:41:14.980 --> 02:41:21.740]  the same at $28,000 and guess what that is the federal poverty level for a
[02:41:21.740 --> 02:41:26.020]  family of five this is a article again that I was quoting from by Michael
[02:41:26.020 --> 02:41:30.540]  Schneider and he points out that 38% of all Americans make less than 20,000 a
[02:41:30.540 --> 02:41:35.900]  year if you were making minimum wage today you would be making less than 20,000
[02:41:35.900 --> 02:41:41.740]  a year you'd be making about 14 $15,000 if you still had a 40 hour work week you
[02:41:41.740 --> 02:41:47.900]  might have seen that cut down to 30 hours because of Obamacare mandates your
[02:41:47.900 --> 02:41:51.700]  employer may have cut your hours down but let's say that you're getting 40 hours
[02:41:51.700 --> 02:41:55.620]  and you're making minimum wage you're not going to be paying two and a half
[02:41:55.620 --> 02:42:00.060]  percent you're not going you're going to be paying that 695 dollars anybody that
[02:42:00.060 --> 02:42:03.820]  makes more than 28,000 they're going to be paid two and a half percent so if
[02:42:03.820 --> 02:42:08.940]  you're making $100,000 you're going to pay $2,500 as an Obamacare penalty if you
[02:42:08.940 --> 02:42:12.820]  don't have insurance but the people who can least afford to get the insurance
[02:42:12.820 --> 02:42:16.620]  who are on the bottom end of this they're going to be paying a penalty of
[02:42:16.620 --> 02:42:21.460]  five percent if they're making minimum wage how's that working out for you that
[02:42:21.460 --> 02:42:28.140]  socialist compassion that's where we see this going all the time I just want to
[02:42:28.140 --> 02:42:32.380]  reiterate again the theme that we see happening over and over again in the
[02:42:32.380 --> 02:42:38.740]  news and that is the just ignoring the law and what that does to our system
[02:42:38.740 --> 02:42:44.500]  many people can't really understand what is at stake in the Benghazi hearings
[02:42:44.500 --> 02:42:48.300]  they can't understand what's going on with Hillary Clinton's emails because
[02:42:48.300 --> 02:42:53.220]  they're too invested in her personally just like Bernie Sanders couldn't really
[02:42:53.220 --> 02:42:57.740]  see past the fact that these guys were poetry spouting hippies but they were
[02:42:57.740 --> 02:43:02.900]  also authoritarian murderers okay we're stealing people's property who were
[02:43:02.900 --> 02:43:06.700]  keeping it for themselves but he couldn't see past the facade he still
[02:43:06.700 --> 02:43:11.100]  can't 30 years later people can't understand what's going on with Hillary
[02:43:11.100 --> 02:43:15.660]  Clinton's emails because they're too invested in partisan politics are too
[02:43:15.660 --> 02:43:22.500]  invested in the person so to help you understand this let's think of this so
[02:43:22.500 --> 02:43:25.860]  that you can see this objectively let's think of this in the abstract let's
[02:43:25.860 --> 02:43:30.700]  let's make up an imaginary country let's pretend there's some country called
[02:43:30.700 --> 02:43:36.660]  Canada that you've never heard of okay what would happen if they deleted
[02:43:36.660 --> 02:43:41.340]  emails the government officials they're deleted emails what would happen in
[02:43:41.340 --> 02:43:46.300]  Canada well let's take a look at this what if there was a place called British
[02:43:46.300 --> 02:43:51.780]  Columbia and what if the Premier there maybe named Christie Clark routinely
[02:43:51.780 --> 02:43:57.580]  thwarted information request freedom of information quest sometimes triple
[02:43:57.580 --> 02:44:02.580]  deleting emails you know to make sure that they're completely gone well they
[02:44:02.580 --> 02:44:07.620]  just might call for more changes to an embedded culture that discourages written
[02:44:07.620 --> 02:44:12.140]  documentation and record keeping this is from the globe and mail in Canada you
[02:44:12.140 --> 02:44:15.420]  know that place you've never heard of the provincial government they said
[02:44:15.420 --> 02:44:20.300]  either quote willfully or negligently fails to produce documents and evades
[02:44:20.300 --> 02:44:25.340]  personal accountability by relying on only verbal responses to information
[02:44:25.340 --> 02:44:29.180]  request they won't put anything in writing in one case a senior aid lied
[02:44:29.180 --> 02:44:32.500]  under oath even though they're doing it verbally they lie even though they're
[02:44:32.500 --> 02:44:37.500]  under oath they lie they lied to commission investigators about his role
[02:44:37.500 --> 02:44:42.980]  in deleting emails that were the subject of an information request in response to
[02:44:42.980 --> 02:44:46.340]  government on Thursday accepted the resignation of that aid at the center of
[02:44:46.340 --> 02:44:50.500]  the investigation imagine that if somebody lied under oath if somebody
[02:44:50.500 --> 02:44:55.420]  obstructed justice they would at least be fired they ought to be going to jail
[02:44:55.420 --> 02:44:58.340]  but they would at least be fired can you imagine imaginary country like that
[02:44:58.340 --> 02:45:03.900]  certainly wouldn't be America so in some other countries like Iceland they jail
[02:45:03.900 --> 02:45:07.580]  the bankers when they steal from the people and in Canada they kind of get
[02:45:07.580 --> 02:45:12.420]  upset if you delete emails and do cover-ups they point out in specific
[02:45:12.420 --> 02:45:16.740]  cases they fail to tell the truth under oath and they have now been referred to
[02:45:16.740 --> 02:45:22.460]  the RCMP the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in other words it's a crime to
[02:45:22.460 --> 02:45:29.660]  commit perjury to obstruct justice do you remember Richard Nixon remember
[02:45:29.660 --> 02:45:33.660]  Hillary Clinton was part of the team that was investigating Richard Nixon now
[02:45:33.660 --> 02:45:40.860]  she's become Richard Nixon just like Barack Obama has they say that mr. Ms.
[02:45:40.860 --> 02:45:45.860]  Denham who is investigating this has done a very good job exposing the culture
[02:45:45.860 --> 02:45:51.500]  of deception which is delete delete delete that's what the investigators said
[02:45:51.500 --> 02:45:55.700]  here they said that their conduct was reprehensible and understand too that
[02:45:55.700 --> 02:46:01.060]  what Hillary Clinton is saying when she says oh these aren't classified
[02:46:01.060 --> 02:46:05.300]  documents so we've talked about that that in it of itself is a lie many of
[02:46:05.300 --> 02:46:10.660]  these documents are born classified that's what the fellow who set up the
[02:46:10.660 --> 02:46:13.780]  rules he's retired now but he was setting up the rules for how the
[02:46:13.780 --> 02:46:16.020]  government handles classified information he says when you have
[02:46:16.020 --> 02:46:20.100]  confidential communications between heads of state between the Secretary of
[02:46:20.100 --> 02:46:24.380]  State and other heads of state that is born classified you don't have to wait
[02:46:24.380 --> 02:46:30.900]  for it to get a stamp so she knows that she knows that there are some things on
[02:46:30.900 --> 02:46:36.180]  her server that are classified but nevertheless understand that NSA
[02:46:36.180 --> 02:46:39.500]  whistleblower Thomas Drake and I've interviewed him pointed out that he'd
[02:46:39.500 --> 02:46:45.860]  been prosecuted for and persecuted really for having unclassified as well as
[02:46:45.860 --> 02:46:49.500]  classified documents the classified documents he had were documents that
[02:46:49.500 --> 02:46:54.340]  should not have been classified there were things like know your enemy make
[02:46:54.340 --> 02:46:59.860]  sure you back up your work what if these types of duck and cover instructional
[02:46:59.860 --> 02:47:03.820]  documents they should not have been classified but he was prosecuted
[02:47:03.820 --> 02:47:10.220]  for having unclassified documents on his computer as well of course they dropped
[02:47:10.220 --> 02:47:14.500]  those charges the day he was to go to trial it was simply an outright
[02:47:14.500 --> 02:47:20.460]  persecution nevertheless that is precisely what Hillary Clinton is saying
[02:47:20.460 --> 02:47:24.260]  there's nothing at all to see here move along we don't have anything at all as
[02:47:24.260 --> 02:47:28.420]  a matter of fact they're complaining about the fact that so much money has
[02:47:28.420 --> 02:47:31.660]  been spent on this investigation they say Benghazi investigation just keeps
[02:47:31.660 --> 02:47:35.620]  going on and on and on it's going on longer than the JFK investigation and
[02:47:35.620 --> 02:47:39.180]  it's like well yeah you know we never got any answers on the JFK investigation
[02:47:39.180 --> 02:47:43.020]  either unfortunately maybe it should have gone longer but here's this article
[02:47:43.020 --> 02:47:47.420]  points out that the feds have sent more on origami condoms and fat lesbian
[02:47:47.420 --> 02:47:50.060]  studies than on the Benghazi committee and you know when I looked at this I
[02:47:50.060 --> 02:47:55.180]  thought they'd left a comma off in between origami and condoms but there's
[02:47:55.180 --> 02:47:59.780]  abs and there must be something called origami condoms I don't know I'll leave
[02:47:59.780 --> 02:48:04.860]  that to Howard Stern to explore that but when it comes to fat lesbians I can
[02:48:04.860 --> 02:48:07.580]  understand why they would want to study fat lesbians because we've got most of
[02:48:07.580 --> 02:48:10.620]  the people in the federal government most of the departments under Obama are
[02:48:10.620 --> 02:48:14.420]  being run by fat lesbians but maybe they could save some money and just ask
[02:48:14.420 --> 02:48:18.260]  Hillary Clinton and Janet Napolitano why they're fat
[02:48:18.260 --> 02:48:22.660]  nevertheless Harry Reid is demanding that the Republican National Committee
[02:48:22.660 --> 02:48:28.540]  reimburse the government for the cost of the investigation so we shouldn't be
[02:48:28.540 --> 02:48:35.980]  concerned about things like having classified documents on your server we
[02:48:35.980 --> 02:48:41.460]  just had CIA director Brennan have his emails hacked I guess we shouldn't be
[02:48:41.460 --> 02:48:45.100]  concerned about that either does that that's not really matter why should we
[02:48:45.100 --> 02:48:50.220]  be concerned about Brennan's emails it's no big deal do you think maybe that the
[02:48:50.220 --> 02:48:54.340]  CIA director is a target do you think maybe the Secretary of State is a high
[02:48:54.340 --> 02:48:59.940]  value target for state actors he got his emails hacked by a teenager a teenager
[02:48:59.940 --> 02:49:05.300]  broken and got the CIA director's emails he stole his password three times
[02:49:05.300 --> 02:49:10.220]  before he shut down his this this teenager stole the CIA director's
[02:49:10.220 --> 02:49:14.300]  password three times before the CIA director in frustration shut down his
[02:49:14.300 --> 02:49:19.980]  account say that's why this is important it's important when we have a
[02:49:19.980 --> 02:49:26.340]  Secretary of State who flaunts the law who keeps the stuff secret for the same
[02:49:26.340 --> 02:49:30.940]  reason that the people in Canada were keeping the stuff secret because they
[02:49:30.940 --> 02:49:34.220]  were deleting any information that people were requesting they didn't had
[02:49:34.220 --> 02:49:38.420]  things that they wanted to hide but they also created security risks as we
[02:49:38.420 --> 02:49:41.900]  pointed out before we have this national religion of national security
[02:49:41.900 --> 02:49:46.460]  everything must be sacrificed for national security except Hillary Clinton's
[02:49:46.460 --> 02:49:50.620]  career that's where we are now there's some real questions that have been raised
[02:49:50.620 --> 02:49:54.100]  about Benghazi questions that we need to get answers to for instance let's take
[02:49:54.100 --> 02:49:59.100]  a look at this flashback Broadwell said the Benghazi attacks were aimed at
[02:49:59.100 --> 02:50:06.260]  illegal CIA prison and of course this was the mistress of David Petraeus who
[02:50:06.260 --> 02:50:10.940]  was a eventually became a CIA director this is Paula Broadwell she was also a
[02:50:10.940 --> 02:50:16.420]  lieutenant colonel she served under General Petraeus as they say and she said
[02:50:16.420 --> 02:50:20.860]  on October 26th after the attacks on September 11th she told an alumni
[02:50:20.860 --> 02:50:24.560]  symposium at the University of Denver that the CIA was running a prison at the
[02:50:24.560 --> 02:50:28.460]  consulate she says I don't know if a lot of you have heard this but the CIA
[02:50:28.460 --> 02:50:33.500]  annex had actually taken a couple of Libyan militia members prisoner and they
[02:50:33.500 --> 02:50:36.580]  think the attack on the consulate was an effort to try to get these prisoners
[02:50:36.580 --> 02:50:42.500]  back so that's one part of it the other part of it is the arms trade that was
[02:50:42.500 --> 02:50:46.780]  going we had multiple people talk about the arms deals that were being run out
[02:50:46.780 --> 02:50:51.540]  of there but of course Hillary Clinton throws Stevens Ambassador Stevens under
[02:50:51.540 --> 02:50:55.660]  the bus even as he's dead even as they drug him through the streets she drags
[02:50:55.660 --> 02:50:59.020]  his reputation to the through the street saying he's responsible hunters

[02:54:05.660 --> 02:54:10.100]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show we were just talking about how Hillary is
[02:54:10.100 --> 02:54:15.260]  escaping justice of course we don't want to look too closely as to what might
[02:54:15.260 --> 02:54:19.340]  have been happening in Benghazi the arms trade was been multiple
[02:54:19.340 --> 02:54:23.780]  investigations talking about that outside of the House committee we shouldn't
[02:54:23.780 --> 02:54:28.460]  look at that we shouldn't look at the hidden emails and she throws now the
[02:54:28.460 --> 02:54:33.900]  ambassador Christopher Stevens under the bus post posthumously he says we're
[02:54:33.900 --> 02:54:37.820]  really counting on Chris to guide us and to give us information on the ground
[02:54:37.820 --> 02:54:44.060]  in other words he failed not me and now as more evidence of the fact that we
[02:54:44.060 --> 02:54:49.660]  don't ever seem to be able to prosecute wrongdoing with officials here in this
[02:54:49.660 --> 02:54:55.860]  country this just came out CNN reports former IRS official lowest learner will
[02:54:55.860 --> 02:55:02.140]  not face charges for targeting political groups there you go exactly what we were
[02:55:02.140 --> 02:55:05.860]  talking about we began the show by talking about the fact that Iceland is
[02:55:05.860 --> 02:55:11.580]  jailing 26 CEOs mostly of banks not lower-level officials not scapegoats at
[02:55:11.580 --> 02:55:17.140]  the bottom but CEOs who tried to defraud the people but of course in America
[02:55:17.140 --> 02:55:22.380]  they're not only too big to fail they're too big to jail but even an IRS official
[02:55:22.380 --> 02:55:27.620]  who does the kind of things that Nixon was impeached for remember he was using
[02:55:27.620 --> 02:55:32.940]  IRS against his political enemies lowest learner is not going to face charges for
[02:55:32.940 --> 02:55:38.420]  targeting people for their political affiliation that's the kind of country
[02:55:38.420 --> 02:55:43.580]  that we live in of course when asked about whether or not asked about her
[02:55:43.580 --> 02:55:47.180]  criminal of the FBI's criminal investigation into her this is the way
[02:55:47.180 --> 02:55:51.100]  Hillary Clinton responded on the Benghazi inquiries yesterday
[02:55:51.100 --> 02:55:55.420]  he said or said that quote the American people are sick and tired of hearing about
[02:55:55.420 --> 02:56:01.940]  your damn emails but there are a lot of people who are not including FBI
[02:56:01.940 --> 02:56:06.060]  officials looking into whether national security was compromised because of this
[02:56:06.060 --> 02:56:10.300]  server and this is this is something else that is very yeah just just laugh
[02:56:10.300 --> 02:56:16.420]  about that sounds just like this pen doesn't it yeah that's the way you get
[02:56:16.420 --> 02:56:19.980]  rid of all the problems you just laugh them off as if there was any controlling
[02:56:19.980 --> 02:56:24.740]  legal authority here remember when Al Gore said that everybody was amazed yeah
[02:56:24.740 --> 02:56:27.780]  there's no legal controlling legal authority here well certainly there
[02:56:27.780 --> 02:56:31.980]  isn't any controlling legal authority anymore in America and look at how Hillary
[02:56:31.980 --> 02:56:36.940]  is using this she's the victim she just laughs off any criminal investigations
[02:56:36.940 --> 02:56:41.820]  and of course Obama pours cold water on any criminal investigations in advance
[02:56:41.820 --> 02:56:45.580]  essentially saying well I'm sure that there wasn't anything to that they're
[02:56:45.580 --> 02:56:50.580]  still investigating that's unprecedented for a president to come in and say I'm
[02:56:50.580 --> 02:56:53.700]  sure they're not going to find anything as they're still conducting the
[02:56:53.700 --> 02:56:57.580]  investigation of course it was called on that by some former FBI officials but
[02:56:57.580 --> 02:57:03.500]  Hillary is using the Benghazi hearings to do fundraising on her Twitter account
[02:57:03.500 --> 02:57:11.020]  look at this the Clinton Foundation is a slush fund absolutely a slush fund this
[02:57:11.020 --> 02:57:15.060]  is from Isabel Vincent she says the Clinton Foundation's finances are so
[02:57:15.060 --> 02:57:19.100]  messy that the nation's most influential charity watchdog put it on its watch
[02:57:19.100 --> 02:57:25.020]  list of problematic non-profits last month the Clinton's mega charity put
[02:57:25.020 --> 02:57:28.460]  in more than a hundred and forty million dollars in grants and pledges and
[02:57:28.460 --> 02:57:34.540]  they only gave out nine million dollars let's do the math on that you take in a
[02:57:34.540 --> 02:57:37.340]  hundred and forty million and you give out nine million are you really a
[02:57:37.340 --> 02:57:43.980]  charity they say a good charity is going to give 75 percent of its money to the
[02:57:43.980 --> 02:57:48.820]  people that they're supposed to help now what does the Clinton Foundation do they
[02:57:48.820 --> 02:57:53.620]  don't give 75 percent they have a lot more overhead than 25 percent they give
[02:57:53.620 --> 02:58:00.460]  out six and a half percent they have 94 and a half percent of the money goes to
[02:58:00.460 --> 02:58:05.740]  administration to travel to salaries to bonuses with the fattest payouts going
[02:58:05.740 --> 02:58:10.900]  to family friends they say so chad charity navigator which rates non-profits
[02:58:10.900 --> 02:58:15.300]  refused to rate the Clinton Foundation because it's a typical business model
[02:58:15.300 --> 02:58:19.340]  does not meet our criteria then the Washington Post reports after that
[02:58:19.340 --> 02:58:23.660]  there's another 26 million dollars that they didn't even report so now if you
[02:58:23.660 --> 02:58:29.620]  redo the math that means that they are only giving out five and a half percent
[02:58:29.620 --> 02:58:34.780]  not 75 percent like a legitimate charity would stay with us we'll be right back
[02:58:34.780 --> 02:58:37.180]  with a fourth hour
[02:58:37.180 --> 02:58:52.740]  you are listening to GCN visit GCN live comm today and it's that type of
[02:58:52.740 --> 02:58:56.580]  behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true
[02:58:56.580 --> 02:59:00.660]  nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children

[02:59:14.380 --> 02:59:17.980]  wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous
[02:59:17.980 --> 02:59:22.180]  psychotropic drugs working with my team we set out to find the best formula with
[02:59:22.180 --> 02:59:25.660]  the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take we

[03:00:10.140 --> 03:00:16.900]  fix bayonets we are now entering overdrive with your host alex jones
[03:00:16.900 --> 03:00:22.620]  broadcasting live from the front lines if you are receiving this transmission you
[03:00:22.620 --> 03:00:26.700]  are the resistance
[03:00:26.700 --> 03:00:30.100]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night and we're doing this is our
[03:00:30.100 --> 03:00:33.380]  fourth hour of the news wrap-up we're also going to have at the bottom of the
[03:00:33.380 --> 03:00:38.300]  hour abbey johnson a planned parenthood whistleblowers used to be a manager here
[03:00:38.300 --> 03:00:42.980]  in texas of a planned parenthood facility she knows them from the inside
[03:00:42.980 --> 03:00:48.660]  out and as we pointed out earlier in the show the planned parenthood crowd is
[03:00:48.660 --> 03:00:53.580]  very upset that some raw videos have leaked out of a house investigation
[03:00:53.580 --> 03:00:57.980]  committee this is the committee chaired by jason chaifetz who was also one of
[03:00:57.980 --> 03:01:02.860]  those in the running for the house speakership to replace john bainer they
[03:01:02.860 --> 03:01:05.980]  were looking at these planned parenthood videos that were done by the
[03:01:05.980 --> 03:01:10.180]  center for medical progress and of course planned parenthood said well these
[03:01:10.180 --> 03:01:14.980]  things have been dishonestly and deceptively edited so the committee
[03:01:14.980 --> 03:01:19.140]  said give us the raw footage we'll take a look at that so the abortionists
[03:01:19.140 --> 03:01:22.260]  replied and of course this is the national abortion federation they got a
[03:01:22.260 --> 03:01:27.300]  temporary restraining order said no no no you better not let that stuff get out
[03:01:27.300 --> 03:01:32.940]  nevertheless it did leak somebody in a house staffer apparently leaked this to
[03:01:32.940 --> 03:01:38.140]  a conservative website got news the editor ignored the injunction and said
[03:01:38.140 --> 03:01:44.100]  I will contest any unconstitutional prior restraint of speech so they have he
[03:01:44.100 --> 03:01:49.940]  has now put out the unedited raw footage and so the question is why would they
[03:01:49.940 --> 03:01:55.020]  object to that if there's not anything that is incriminating I want to take a
[03:01:55.020 --> 03:01:59.780]  look in this hour before we get to abby johnson's interview at the bottom of the
[03:01:59.780 --> 03:02:05.940]  hour I want to take a look also at this issue of the $750 pill is it corporate
[03:02:05.940 --> 03:02:10.980]  greed is it excessive regulation or is it both this is an article by mary ruart
[03:02:10.980 --> 03:02:15.660]  someone in that I knew from the libertarian party she ran for office
[03:02:15.660 --> 03:02:18.080]  multiple times in libertarian party she's somebody who worked in the
[03:02:18.080 --> 03:02:21.220]  pharmaceutical industry I think she has an interesting take on that and there's
[03:02:21.220 --> 03:02:26.700]  been an update on this story as well so we're going to talk about what has come
[03:02:26.700 --> 03:02:30.060]  up with that in the next segment but first I want to go back to this story
[03:02:30.060 --> 03:02:34.980]  that just broke on CNN about a former IRS official lowest learner they say she
[03:02:34.980 --> 03:02:38.940]  will not be charged this is what CNN is reporting there'll be no charges against
[03:02:38.940 --> 03:02:45.020]  former IRS official lowest learner or anyone else at the agency said the
[03:02:45.020 --> 03:02:50.420]  Justice Department in a letter yeah Obama's Justice Department the same
[03:02:50.420 --> 03:02:56.460]  people that would not take any action against banks that were laundering money
[03:02:56.460 --> 03:03:02.300]  for drug dealers and terrorists multiple times caught doing that they would not
[03:03:02.300 --> 03:03:07.700]  take any action against the banks who are rigging the LIBOR rate okay that's
[03:03:07.700 --> 03:03:14.460]  the London interbank exchange rate that is used to set up all as an index to
[03:03:14.460 --> 03:03:18.220]  set up interest rates and to adjust your variable rate interest I mean if you've
[03:03:18.220 --> 03:03:21.420]  got something like a credit card if you've got a home loan that is set up as
[03:03:21.420 --> 03:03:27.580]  a variable rate loan it's based on the LIBOR rates and they're not they were
[03:03:27.580 --> 03:03:32.700]  manipulating that to make money in London criminally manipulating that but of
[03:03:32.700 --> 03:03:36.460]  course nobody's going to go to jail for that nobody's going to go to jail for
[03:03:36.460 --> 03:03:40.860]  targeting people at the IRS either they say they found substantial evidence of
[03:03:40.860 --> 03:03:45.740]  mismanagement of poor judgment of institutional inertia leading to the
[03:03:45.740 --> 03:03:51.140]  belief by many tax-exempt applicants that the IRS targeted them based on their
[03:03:51.140 --> 03:03:56.340]  political viewpoints but poor management is not a crime says the Justice
[03:03:56.340 --> 03:04:01.620]  Department well evidently if you know the right people nothing is a crime in
[03:04:01.620 --> 03:04:06.860]  America anymore that's really what we're seeing here this is nothing but
[03:04:06.860 --> 03:04:12.180]  criminals getting away with it we just heard Hillary Clinton laughing about the
[03:04:12.180 --> 03:04:16.980]  FBI investigating her and understand that the government as I mentioned before
[03:04:16.980 --> 03:04:22.860]  they prosecuted an NSA whistleblower Thomas Drake and they said that he had
[03:04:22.860 --> 03:04:28.260]  classified documents on his private server they said he had unclassified
[03:04:28.260 --> 03:04:33.060]  documents on his private server they came after him it was a baloney
[03:04:33.060 --> 03:04:38.020]  prosecution but nevertheless that would have been a crime if he had really done
[03:04:38.020 --> 03:04:42.620]  that and people have been prosecuted for that but it depends on what level you
[03:04:42.620 --> 03:04:45.220]  are in the government because that's the kind of corrupt government we have say
[03:04:45.220 --> 03:04:57.260]  with us we'll be right back to talk about this $750 pill
[03:04:57.260 --> 03:05:02.220]  after the release of numerous videos showing questionable Planned Parenthood
[03:05:02.220 --> 03:05:05.220]  practices multiple facilities have been raided
[03:05:05.220 --> 03:05:09.500]  Reuters reports Texas officials rated several Planned Parenthood facilities
[03:05:09.500 --> 03:05:13.860]  on Thursday and a move that comes days after the state Republican leaders bar
[03:05:13.860 --> 03:05:17.660]  the women's health group from receiving state Medicaid money the inspector
[03:05:17.660 --> 03:05:21.700]  general's office declined to comment but its agents were seen on local news
[03:05:21.700 --> 03:05:26.220]  reports entering a Planned Parenthood facility in San Antonio Texas said it
[03:05:26.220 --> 03:05:29.860]  would launch a probe of Planned Parenthood after the release of videos in
[03:05:29.860 --> 03:05:34.500]  July by anti-abortion activist group Center for Medical Progress in which a
[03:05:34.500 --> 03:05:38.540]  Planned Parenthood official is seen talking about transactions involving
[03:05:38.540 --> 03:05:43.260]  fetal tissue and speaking on a personal note Planned Parenthood continues to say
[03:05:43.260 --> 03:05:46.980]  that the videos were edited which they were much like you would edit a state
[03:05:46.980 --> 03:05:50.980]  of a union address down to a few sound bites but that doesn't mean that they
[03:05:50.980 --> 03:05:57.620]  were taken out of context you can find more reports on info wars.com

[03:08:05.500 --> 03:08:12.980]  information war continues it's alex jones and the GCN radio network
[03:08:15.260 --> 03:08:19.060]  welcome back to the alex joneshaw and david night this is our fourth hour the
[03:08:19.060 --> 03:08:22.140]  news wrap-up at the bottom of the hour we're going to be talking to Planned
[03:08:22.140 --> 03:08:26.980]  Parenthood whistleblower abbey johnson she was a former manager to Planned
[03:08:26.980 --> 03:08:31.300]  Parenthood facility we're gonna talk to her about the latest revelations and
[03:08:31.300 --> 03:08:35.820]  of course the fact that Planned Parenthood is very upset now that the raw videos
[03:08:35.820 --> 03:08:42.100]  have been leaked from a house committee investigating the the videos that were
[03:08:42.100 --> 03:08:46.020]  put out by the Center for Medical Progress I had to look it up it's such a
[03:08:46.020 --> 03:08:50.900]  generic name and it was brilliant for them to use that name because they look
[03:08:50.900 --> 03:08:54.180]  like a medical organization but always such a generic name I always have to
[03:08:54.180 --> 03:08:57.620]  look it up whenever I mention it but the Center for Medical Progress did the
[03:08:57.620 --> 03:09:01.060]  undercover videos they said oh they're heavily edited and then the raw
[03:09:01.060 --> 03:09:05.100]  videos they were concerned would get out so they got a court injunction but they
[03:09:05.100 --> 03:09:11.740]  have leaked out nevertheless going back to the Clinton Benghazi committee
[03:09:11.740 --> 03:09:16.180]  hearing of course many people this is unfolded over such a long period of time
[03:09:16.180 --> 03:09:22.020]  that just like the IRS investigations of Lois Lerner what the IRS is doing
[03:09:22.020 --> 03:09:25.620]  targeting political groups that's now been thrown out by the Justice Department
[03:09:25.620 --> 03:09:28.780]  they say she's not going to be charged and nobody else that the IRS is going to
[03:09:28.780 --> 03:09:34.420]  be charged either they let these investigations drag out for a very
[03:09:34.420 --> 03:09:39.100]  very long time and people start to forget the startling elements of these
[03:09:39.100 --> 03:09:44.340]  things when they first broke just like we forget the timeline of Benghazi we
[03:09:44.340 --> 03:09:50.660]  forget that Hillary Clinton and the Justice the State Department came up
[03:09:50.660 --> 03:09:54.820]  with multiple explanations for what had happened there we got a different
[03:09:54.820 --> 03:10:00.420]  explanation every day for several days they charged a filmmaker and put him in
[03:10:00.420 --> 03:10:05.940]  jail saying that he had incited the riot absolute nonsense but that's the
[03:10:05.940 --> 03:10:11.260]  level they will go to she will lie to the face of the people whose family died
[03:10:11.260 --> 03:10:16.900]  there in order to cover up what really happened there she will throw the former
[03:10:16.900 --> 03:10:20.860]  ambassador who died and was drugged through the streets she will throw him
[03:10:20.860 --> 03:10:25.780]  under the bus now saying well we were like relying on him to help us with
[03:10:25.780 --> 03:10:30.340]  information to help us with information about security no no they knew what was
[03:10:30.340 --> 03:10:35.740]  going on there and it was also part of an arms trade that was going on there but
[03:10:35.740 --> 03:10:41.900]  of course now there's no question that Libya has become a terrorist arms
[03:10:41.900 --> 03:10:47.020]  bizarre thanks to our failed foreign policy of Obama and the Secretary of
[03:10:47.020 --> 03:10:52.260]  State but she just laughs this off one of the things that came out of the
[03:10:52.260 --> 03:10:56.620]  hearing yesterday I thought it was interesting what what drudge noticed
[03:10:56.620 --> 03:11:01.900]  and he had this up at the top of the drudge report one of the things that he
[03:11:01.900 --> 03:11:05.780]  thought was most significant about it was Hillary Clinton's coughing fit let's
[03:11:05.780 --> 03:11:09.500]  listen to what happened as they were asking her questions he said maybe this
[03:11:09.500 --> 03:11:13.540]  brings up some serious questions about her health maybe that's the most
[03:11:13.540 --> 03:11:18.220]  interesting thing to come out of these hearings this is in Europe commanded a
[03:11:18.220 --> 03:11:22.180]  missile cruiser a missile destroyer a tanker he served in Vietnam in the Persian
[03:11:22.180 --> 03:11:35.020]  Gulf excuse me you need some water madam if anybody in the audience knows
[03:11:35.020 --> 03:11:44.940]  Heimlich maneuver please remain seated would you like to take this goes on for
[03:11:44.940 --> 03:11:48.140]  quite some time we won't play the rest of it here because people turning out on
[03:11:48.140 --> 03:11:51.940]  the radio kind of wonder what's going on with somebody just coughing and
[03:11:51.940 --> 03:11:56.060]  silence there but of course the questioner a Democrat was covering for her
[03:11:56.060 --> 03:12:00.700]  on that as well he just started monologuing about whatever to fill
[03:12:00.700 --> 03:12:05.060]  time so people wouldn't notice that she couldn't talk at all so I think that was
[03:12:05.060 --> 03:12:08.140]  a pretty pretty interesting development the drudge thought it was
[03:12:08.140 --> 03:12:11.860]  interesting said maybe that's the most interesting thing to come out of the
[03:12:11.860 --> 03:12:16.380]  Benghazi hearings because they are essentially stonewalling there as they
[03:12:16.380 --> 03:12:20.900]  have everywhere else with the IRS frauds with the prosecutions the non
[03:12:20.900 --> 03:12:26.300]  prosecutions of banks everywhere by the mayor Putin is saying it says that the
[03:12:26.300 --> 03:12:32.060]  US is using terrorists as a battering ram to overthrow disliked regimes of
[03:12:32.060 --> 03:12:35.020]  course he of course they are we've been saying that for a long time and it's
[03:12:35.020 --> 03:12:39.900]  good that he is saying this it's good that we have people on the world stage
[03:12:39.900 --> 03:12:44.620]  pointing out that we are using terrorists as surrogates he certainly knows
[03:12:44.620 --> 03:12:50.420]  that he saw us using al-Qaeda against Russia in Afghanistan they were called
[03:12:50.420 --> 03:12:57.420]  a Mujahadzine remember back in Reagan's time they created them they
[03:12:57.420 --> 03:13:02.380]  equipped them against the Russians they then eventually became al-Qaeda someone
[03:13:02.380 --> 03:13:06.380]  bin Laden was one of their guys they've also used Islamic terrorists to attack
[03:13:06.380 --> 03:13:12.860]  Russia via the Chechnya Islamists and they moved those same Chechens the same
[03:13:12.860 --> 03:13:18.340]  Chechen Islamic jihadis they moved to Syria we had an interview with one of
[03:13:18.340 --> 03:13:22.340]  the leaders go public just about three weeks ago I think it was where he was
[03:13:22.340 --> 03:13:27.460]  talking about how they had relocated them the CIA and others had relocated
[03:13:27.460 --> 03:13:32.980]  them from using them against Russia into Syria so that's precisely what they're
[03:13:32.980 --> 03:13:36.940]  doing and Putin has another article from Putin that's on that was on info wars
[03:13:36.940 --> 03:13:40.900]  calm that's Mikhail Phelan you can check out the details on that Putin also
[03:13:40.900 --> 03:13:46.100]  says there's no need to distinguish between moderate and other terrorists are
[03:13:46.100 --> 03:13:50.420]  they're really moderate terrorist I don't think so I think that they're all
[03:13:50.420 --> 03:13:54.660]  terrorists except we have to understand and this is finally starting to come out
[03:13:54.660 --> 03:13:59.700]  that the United States is using all of these people as surrogates and has for a
[03:13:59.700 --> 03:14:05.940]  very long time let's go to health news at this moment that we've had a lot of
[03:14:05.940 --> 03:14:09.180]  back-and-forth saying that it was a market failure remember when we had that
[03:14:09.180 --> 03:14:14.140]  guy who was a young hedge fund manager made a lot of money decided he'd buy a
[03:14:14.140 --> 03:14:17.620]  pharmaceutical company touring pharmaceuticals his name he would the
[03:14:17.620 --> 03:14:21.340]  CEO was Martin Screlli I think is the way you pronounce his last name
[03:14:21.340 --> 03:14:25.980]  nevertheless he bought this pharmaceutical company that had a very old drug
[03:14:25.980 --> 03:14:31.020]  that was now that it's its patent had expired and they were selling this drug
[03:14:31.020 --> 03:14:39.140]  for $13.50 per pill and he raised the price to $750 a pill the pill was
[03:14:39.140 --> 03:14:45.020]  Dariprem and it's being used at the moment for people who are struggling
[03:14:45.020 --> 03:14:51.740]  with AIDS and so that 5,000% increase in the price of that drug many people said
[03:14:51.740 --> 03:14:55.580]  how you know look at this this is what happens when you have unbridled
[03:14:55.580 --> 03:15:00.780]  capitalism this kind of greed well Mary Ruart writes the column and she says a
[03:15:00.780 --> 03:15:06.500]  $750 pill is it corporate greed or is it excessive regulation or is it both now
[03:15:06.500 --> 03:15:10.100]  she is someone who is a she's a libertarian writer and activist she's
[03:15:10.100 --> 03:15:15.260]  also been a pharmaceutical researcher so she knows what happens inside the FDA
[03:15:15.260 --> 03:15:19.540]  and she points out that touring pharmaceuticals has had a de facto
[03:15:19.540 --> 03:15:24.980]  monopoly courtesy of the ever-increasing cost of gaining FDA approval both for
[03:15:24.980 --> 03:15:29.940]  new drugs over a billion dollars and 11 years and for generics any generic
[03:15:29.940 --> 03:15:34.940]  company could make this drug Dariprem this patent expired decades ago however
[03:15:34.940 --> 03:15:39.380]  the FDA would require that the company demonstrate that its pill released the
[03:15:39.380 --> 03:15:44.940]  drug into the bloodstream at the same rate as the original Dariprem so
[03:15:44.940 --> 03:15:48.340]  coupled with the cost of setting up FDA approved manufacturing facilities for
[03:15:48.340 --> 03:15:52.420]  their drug a turnaround time of a couple of years or so due to regulatory red
[03:15:52.420 --> 03:15:57.780]  tape and the expensive clinical trials a generic company would need to commit to
[03:15:57.780 --> 03:16:02.420]  spending many millions perhaps tens of millions of dollars even with the
[03:16:02.420 --> 03:16:06.980]  special exemption that the FDA gives drugs that have a small or an orphan
[03:16:06.980 --> 03:16:12.780]  patient population she says FDA mandated drug development both new and generic
[03:16:12.780 --> 03:16:17.300]  virtually eliminates competition I see that's the question we look at this you
[03:16:17.300 --> 03:16:23.860]  say this guy was able to raise the price from 1350 to $750 a pill a 5,000
[03:16:23.860 --> 03:16:28.820]  percent increase why was he able to do that where are the other companies that
[03:16:28.820 --> 03:16:33.220]  are coming out with drugs and she points out well you don't have a free market
[03:16:33.220 --> 03:16:40.100]  when you have excessive regulation by the FDA so the FDA has enacted a certain
[03:16:40.100 --> 03:16:44.740]  kind of drug prohibition haven't they we have the DEA which says you can't take
[03:16:44.740 --> 03:16:49.980]  recreational drugs hallucinogenics or whatever they just have prohibited it
[03:16:49.980 --> 03:16:53.460]  like they did alcohol prohibition except without the constitutional amendment
[03:16:53.460 --> 03:16:57.180]  of course because we don't really need the Constitution anymore we just say
[03:16:57.180 --> 03:17:03.980]  it's make it so but the FDA has gone the other direction the FDA says everything
[03:17:03.980 --> 03:17:09.180]  is prohibited for medical use unless expressly permitted so you have to get
[03:17:09.180 --> 03:17:13.980]  even special permission if you have a fatal disease in order to use it you
[03:17:13.980 --> 03:17:17.740]  can't experiment be part of an experimental program even if you're
[03:17:17.740 --> 03:17:22.620]  going to die the FDA does not allow that except under some circumstances you can
[03:17:22.620 --> 03:17:25.820]  beg them for permission and perhaps they'll let you be part of a program but
[03:17:25.820 --> 03:17:30.380]  you can't make that determination on your own see that's the other side of
[03:17:30.380 --> 03:17:35.260]  drug prohibition the idea and this is pervasive throughout the government the
[03:17:35.260 --> 03:17:38.420]  idea that everything is prohibited unless expressly permitted that we have no
[03:17:38.420 --> 03:17:44.620]  rights we only have government granted privileges well now there's a new twist
[03:17:44.620 --> 03:17:49.780]  on this this is reported by occupied Democrats and they're looking at this
[03:17:49.780 --> 03:17:55.660]  and they say well the price gouging pharmaceutical CEO who is tried to raise
[03:17:55.660 --> 03:18:00.700]  this by 5,000 percent it looks like now he's going to be undercut by another
[03:18:00.700 --> 03:18:05.660]  company a San Diego based company announced that it will sell this drug
[03:18:05.660 --> 03:18:12.500]  dereprim as low as $99 for a 100 pill supply they say yeah that's right it's
[03:18:12.500 --> 03:18:18.980]  just over a dollar per pill so not only are they going to cut down this this
[03:18:18.980 --> 03:18:23.780]  pill that he wanted to sell for $750 but he was selling it for decades at 1350
[03:18:23.780 --> 03:18:27.740]  and nobody went into competition with him now these people are saying they're
[03:18:27.740 --> 03:18:34.940]  going to do it at $1 a pill and I find that very interesting because it just
[03:18:34.940 --> 03:18:39.220]  shows that unless you get this kind of attention and I still have questions
[03:18:39.220 --> 03:18:43.820]  based on what Mary Ruart wrote she's very knowledgeable about the pharmaceutical
[03:18:43.820 --> 03:18:47.660]  industry based on what she wrote is this going to be something like the
[03:18:47.660 --> 03:18:52.380]  McDonald's announcement that they're going to go to natural whole foods to
[03:18:52.380 --> 03:18:57.180]  know antibiotics and their meat to grain fed beef and that sort of thing but
[03:18:57.180 --> 03:19:01.020]  oh yeah if you read the fine print that's going to be years maybe decades
[03:19:01.020 --> 03:19:04.620]  down the road that's not something that's going to happen right away this might
[03:19:04.620 --> 03:19:10.180]  be a PR campaign by this particular company I don't know how long it's going
[03:19:10.180 --> 03:19:14.740]  to take them to get approval for this they may be able to expedite that but
[03:19:14.740 --> 03:19:20.220]  that's precisely the issue if you have a true free market somebody can come in
[03:19:20.220 --> 03:19:24.100]  and create the pill and sell it for whatever they can manufacture it for at
[03:19:24.100 --> 03:19:28.460]  1350 they were making a huge profit if these people can do it for a dollar but
[03:19:28.460 --> 03:19:32.780]  you have to have a free market when the socialists like Bernie Sanders say that
[03:19:32.780 --> 03:19:37.220]  capitalism has failed I would say we haven't tried it we don't have a free
[03:19:37.220 --> 03:19:42.140]  market we have crony capitalism and we have a highly regulated market and most
[03:19:42.140 --> 03:19:47.180]  of those regulations are put on by the pharmaceutical companies they want the
[03:19:47.180 --> 03:19:51.100]  FDA to have those kind of restrictions on there because they want to keep
[03:19:51.100 --> 03:19:55.140]  competition out of their market stay with us we'll be right back and we'll

[03:24:05.780 --> 03:24:10.060]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight your host this hour coming
[03:24:10.060 --> 03:24:14.340]  up in the next segment we'll be talking to a Planned Parenthood whistleblower
[03:24:14.340 --> 03:24:20.220]  Abby Johnson and of course if you haven't heard the news the CNN is
[03:24:20.220 --> 03:24:25.940]  announcing that Lois Lerner and nobody at the IRS will be charged for targeting
[03:24:25.940 --> 03:24:30.380]  political groups that's because we've got a government by criminals and for
[03:24:30.380 --> 03:24:34.020]  criminals you know Hillary Clinton one of the things that came out in the
[03:24:34.020 --> 03:24:36.940]  Benghazi trial just day was the fact that she says I didn't even have a
[03:24:36.940 --> 03:24:43.140]  computer in my State Department office she says most my work was done on most
[03:24:43.140 --> 03:24:46.860]  the work was not done on emails with my closest aides with officials in the
[03:24:46.860 --> 03:24:49.460]  State Department officials in the rest of the world as well as a White House
[03:24:49.460 --> 03:24:53.820]  and people around the world in other words world world world ignore the email
[03:24:53.820 --> 03:24:59.380]  issues here look of course they don't use emails remember when we were in at
[03:24:59.380 --> 03:25:05.580]  Bilderberg in Copenhagen and we saw Ed Balls who was the shadow Chancellor of
[03:25:05.580 --> 03:25:11.020]  the Exchequer that would be essentially we don't have shadow people put in
[03:25:11.020 --> 03:25:15.460]  particular offices here in the United States but if the Republicans who are
[03:25:15.460 --> 03:25:20.700]  out of office if they wanted to put up an opposition or shadow secretary of the
[03:25:20.700 --> 03:25:24.660]  Treasury that would be the equivalent position well Ed Balls chose up to
[03:25:24.660 --> 03:25:30.060]  Bilderberg and he's got a carry-on luggage bag that he's wheeling through
[03:25:30.060 --> 03:25:34.740]  there that is full of papers now you look at this and you say well you know
[03:25:34.740 --> 03:25:38.180]  why doesn't Ed Ball just put all that on a little tiny laptop you know or an
[03:25:38.180 --> 03:25:41.580]  iPad or something you know he could could have his notes there he could show
[03:25:41.580 --> 03:25:45.980]  people he might even impress his fellow Bilderberg attendees with some kind of
[03:25:45.980 --> 03:25:50.980]  really cool PowerPoint display or something right no these people don't
[03:25:50.980 --> 03:25:55.380]  like to put stuff on computers because they get hacked so they walk around
[03:25:55.380 --> 03:26:00.780]  with their little suitcases full of paperwork and as he was trying to come
[03:26:00.780 --> 03:26:05.260]  in they were asking him for his for his credentials he couldn't find his
[03:26:05.260 --> 03:26:09.660]  credentials and he starts going through his bag and my wife was there taking
[03:26:09.660 --> 03:26:13.020]  pictures of him and he's fumbling and all this stuff is falling out of his
[03:26:13.020 --> 03:26:18.420]  suitcase you can see he's got an entire suitcase filled with paper documents for
[03:26:18.420 --> 03:26:22.340]  his co-conspirators at Bilderberg and that's the way this works you know I
[03:26:22.340 --> 03:26:26.660]  mean why should we be concerned for example of the CIA when somebody hacks
[03:26:26.660 --> 03:26:31.940]  the directors emails and takes a look at what he's gotten of course he's got a
[03:26:31.940 --> 03:26:34.540]  lot of personal emails that are there but listen to something that came out of
[03:26:34.540 --> 03:26:38.700]  one of these emails one of the things attached to these emails was
[03:26:38.700 --> 03:26:44.060]  communication that was reflecting government communications and he says
[03:26:44.060 --> 03:26:49.180]  everyone we spoke with on the ground in Afghanistan this is a memo from Lewis
[03:26:49.180 --> 03:26:52.700]  Tucker who is a minority staff director for the Senate Intelligence Committee
[03:26:52.700 --> 03:26:57.140]  vice chairman Christopher Kitt Bond okay so these are people who are working on
[03:26:57.140 --> 03:27:02.180]  the Senate Intelligence Committee and he sends an email to direct CIA director
[03:27:02.180 --> 03:27:07.340]  John Brennan and this email is hacked by a teenager and this is what's attached
[03:27:07.340 --> 03:27:11.500]  to the email everyone we spoke with on the ground in Afghanistan and Pakistan
[03:27:11.500 --> 03:27:16.900]  confessed that they know of no overall US government strategy for the region
[03:27:16.900 --> 03:27:22.820]  rather we observed quality individuals serving judiciously in their own lanes
[03:27:22.820 --> 03:27:27.180]  ungoverned by a coordinated comprehensive strategy in other words nobody
[03:27:27.180 --> 03:27:32.500]  knows what's going on here we don't have any strategy in Afghanistan or in
[03:27:32.500 --> 03:27:36.980]  Pakistan well they don't need a strategy they don't need a goal their only
[03:27:36.980 --> 03:27:42.420]  strategy their only goal is endless war endless war for the military industrial
[03:27:42.420 --> 03:27:46.940]  complex it's interesting that we see them confessing this but of course they
[03:27:46.940 --> 03:27:50.220]  only do that privately that's one of the reasons why they try to hide everything
[03:27:50.220 --> 03:27:53.980]  that's one of the reasons why they have their own separate servers you can only
[03:27:53.980 --> 03:27:58.820]  imagine what was on some of the 30,000 emails that were deleted by
[03:27:58.820 --> 03:28:03.060]  Hillary Clinton and maybe they will find those maybe they won't certainly looks
[03:28:03.060 --> 03:28:06.540]  like the Obama administration doesn't want the FBI to look they're sending out
[03:28:06.540 --> 03:28:11.380]  all kinds of signals saying that and of course they're giving the IRS a pass on
[03:28:11.380 --> 03:28:16.860]  something that is orders of magnitude greater than what Richard Nixon was
[03:28:16.860 --> 03:28:23.900]  impeached for so we now have a criminal kleptocracy that allows anything to go
[03:28:23.900 --> 03:28:28.060]  if you are well connected enough and one of the ways that they do this of course
[03:28:28.060 --> 03:28:31.500]  is by spending information in the media a good example of this is a story about
[03:28:31.500 --> 03:28:35.940]  UK Ebola nurse Kaffir key this is the British nurse that was given a clean
[03:28:35.940 --> 03:28:39.260]  bill of health she had contracted Ebola while she was treating people in Africa
[03:28:39.260 --> 03:28:44.020]  she was given a clean bill of health last January then she had a relapse nine
[03:28:44.020 --> 03:28:47.860]  months later news organizations all over the world were talking about she
[03:28:47.860 --> 03:28:53.060]  nearly died about a week ago and then she began to get better she's now in a
[03:28:53.060 --> 03:28:56.540]  serious condition but she was in critical condition she almost died she got
[03:28:56.540 --> 03:29:02.660]  meningitis and the news about that was hey she never really was cleared of
[03:29:02.660 --> 03:29:07.780]  Ebola and as they started talking to scientists they said yeah we found that
[03:29:07.780 --> 03:29:11.980]  there was a case of sexual transmission of Ebola because it hides out in sexual
[03:29:11.980 --> 03:29:16.460]  organs it hid out in a man's semen he transmitted it to a woman nine seven
[03:29:16.460 --> 03:29:20.780]  months later she subsequently died they found it in a doctor's eye but this is
[03:29:20.780 --> 03:29:25.340]  the way CNN spends it they say UK Ebola nurse was suffering from meningitis not
[03:29:25.340 --> 03:29:30.740]  from a relapse in other words they say the meningitis was caused by Ebola but
[03:29:30.740 --> 03:29:34.980]  not by the virus itself that's kind of like saying nobody ever died of Ebola
[03:29:34.980 --> 03:29:39.260]  they died of dehydration or they died of a heart attack but they didn't die from
[03:29:39.260 --> 03:29:43.780]  Ebola that's what they're telling us and yet the reality that they don't want
[03:29:43.780 --> 03:29:48.060]  you to see is that the Ebola continued to say what it's gonna be right back we're
[03:29:48.060 --> 03:29:56.580]  on the march the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[03:29:57.820 --> 03:30:01.980]  Hillary Clinton will testify in front of the Benghazi committee and of course
[03:30:01.980 --> 03:30:06.220]  she's gonna try and spin this as just partisan politics but let's look at the
[03:30:06.220 --> 03:30:10.980]  facts they lied one of the first moves the Obama administration made after the
[03:30:10.980 --> 03:30:15.460]  Benghazi attack was to contact YouTube in an apparent attempt to blame the attack
[03:30:15.460 --> 03:30:19.900]  on an obscure pastor John video this is according to State Department documents
[03:30:19.900 --> 03:30:24.100]  obtained by judicial watch later the administration famously claimed the
[03:30:24.100 --> 03:30:28.620]  attack was provoked by another YouTube video innocence of Muslims made by an
[03:30:28.620 --> 03:30:32.780]  Egyptian-born filmmaker while they were plotting an enormous lie on the public

[03:33:07.060 --> 03:33:09.580]  mind
[03:33:10.660 --> 03:33:14.820]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight your host and joining us
[03:33:14.820 --> 03:33:20.260]  now is Abby Johnson a planned parent-bed whistleblower and I appreciate you
[03:33:20.260 --> 03:33:24.380]  coming on right you just got off of a plane Abby I appreciate you coming here
[03:33:24.380 --> 03:33:30.500]  to the studio on such short short notice and and fighting traffic getting here
[03:33:30.500 --> 03:33:34.180]  just in the nick of time and she just walked into the studio right now and I
[03:33:34.180 --> 03:33:39.740]  want to ask her to comment on what's going on here in Texas because in Texas
[03:33:39.740 --> 03:33:45.220]  we've had the attorney general as well as the governor they've rated several
[03:33:45.220 --> 03:33:49.620]  planned parenthood organizations looking for records doing an investigation
[03:33:49.620 --> 03:33:53.540]  imagine that doing an investigation of criminal actions you're not going to see
[03:33:53.540 --> 03:33:57.580]  that happening from the federal government so I want to ask her to
[03:33:57.580 --> 03:34:00.780]  comment on that because it's not happening just here in Texas this is
[03:34:00.780 --> 03:34:04.540]  something is happening in multiple states before we do I just want to go back
[03:34:04.540 --> 03:34:08.340]  we ran out of time at the the last segment talking about the way CNN was
[03:34:08.340 --> 03:34:13.060]  spinning this Ebola thing and this is very important to understand we had a
[03:34:13.060 --> 03:34:18.780]  caller who called in last week and said you have to understand Ebola is a virus
[03:34:18.780 --> 03:34:23.780]  it's not going to ever really truly leave your system and we learned because of
[03:34:23.780 --> 03:34:29.700]  the relapse of this nurse nine months after she was given the okay we learned
[03:34:29.700 --> 03:34:35.060]  that of course it can hide out in your in your eye it can hide out in your
[03:34:35.060 --> 03:34:38.780]  central nervous system which is where it hit out in this nurse it can hide out in
[03:34:38.780 --> 03:34:46.140]  the sexual reproductive organs and has been passed on and fatally passed on to
[03:34:46.140 --> 03:34:50.620]  someone else in Africa so this is something that people should be concerned
[03:34:50.620 --> 03:34:54.220]  about they should know how this works and yet the government and especially
[03:34:54.220 --> 03:34:57.180]  mainstream media does not want you to know that so they spin it with this
[03:34:57.180 --> 03:35:01.540]  headline and say well she was suffering from meningitis it wasn't a relapse I'm
[03:35:01.540 --> 03:35:05.980]  sorry but you know it was from Ebola and they admitted that it was from Ebola and
[03:35:05.980 --> 03:35:09.540]  listen to how they report it in the body of the article they say the UK nurse is
[03:35:09.540 --> 03:35:15.660]  suffering meningitis caused by Ebola not the virus itself say doctors I mean
[03:35:15.660 --> 03:35:19.660]  talk about doublespeak and this is what the UK health officials said they said
[03:35:19.660 --> 03:35:25.420]  it was an unusual late comp a complication yeah a late complication like
[03:35:25.420 --> 03:35:29.500]  nine months after she was given the go-ahead and said she was completely
[03:35:29.500 --> 03:35:34.300]  clear and allowed to treat other people that's what they don't want you to see
[03:35:34.300 --> 03:35:39.100]  that's why this they've had such a cavalier attitude about spreading this
[03:35:39.100 --> 03:35:44.780]  to the population even to the extent that this nurse Casey Hickox who was who
[03:35:44.780 --> 03:35:49.380]  went to Africa to treat patients there came back in New Jersey she was
[03:35:49.380 --> 03:35:53.260]  quarantined by Chris Christie now she is suing Chris Christie for quarantining
[03:35:53.260 --> 03:35:57.740]  her and I guess my question would be if you're concerned about people's health if
[03:35:57.740 --> 03:36:01.020]  you don't want people to get Ebola why wouldn't you quarantine yourself as a
[03:36:01.020 --> 03:36:05.180]  courtesy to other people as a concern to other people she goes to Africa to help
[03:36:05.180 --> 03:36:09.460]  people with Ebola why wouldn't she try to keep that from spreading here why
[03:36:09.460 --> 03:36:13.020]  wouldn't she voluntarily quarantine herself I it's absolutely amazing to
[03:36:13.020 --> 03:36:15.540]  me it's one of the first times I've ever seen Chris Christie get something right
[03:36:15.540 --> 03:36:21.220]  and he is sued for doing it so here we go let's go to what's happening with
[03:36:21.220 --> 03:36:24.780]  Planned Parenthood and thank you for joining us Abby Johnson of course you've
[03:36:24.780 --> 03:36:28.860]  been a viewer manager at Planned Parenthood yep and we've talked before
[03:36:28.860 --> 03:36:34.260]  about how you saw things developing at Planned Parenthood just recap that
[03:36:34.260 --> 03:36:39.580]  briefly for people sure yeah a couple things one they implemented an abortion
[03:36:39.580 --> 03:36:43.300]  quota for us and actually doubled the number of abortions that we were
[03:36:43.300 --> 03:36:47.380]  supposed to be selling to women every month so that was the first thing the
[03:36:47.380 --> 03:36:52.660]  second thing though what what really caused me to leave was seeing a live
[03:36:52.660 --> 03:36:58.060]  ultrasound guided abortion procedure take place where I saw a 13 week old baby
[03:36:58.060 --> 03:37:03.940]  fighting and struggling for his life at the hands of the abortionist and I left
[03:37:03.940 --> 03:37:07.180]  in Planned Parenthood sued me because apparently they think it's legal to
[03:37:07.180 --> 03:37:12.820]  become pro-life but they they lost and and now I'm just doing everything I can
[03:37:12.820 --> 03:37:18.260]  to expose what's taking place inside of these abortion clinics not just Planned
[03:37:18.260 --> 03:37:21.460]  Parenthood but certainly Planned Parenthood since they are our largest
[03:37:21.460 --> 03:37:25.300]  abortion chain sure sure and so what you saw there was that they were clearly
[03:37:25.300 --> 03:37:30.500]  operating for profit they were pushing you to push procedures on people and
[03:37:30.500 --> 03:37:33.580]  one of the things that we've seen in these undercover videos is that they are
[03:37:33.580 --> 03:37:38.860]  pushing women to sign these releases so that they can acquire parts that they've
[03:37:38.860 --> 03:37:42.700]  already talked to stem express and other people to know what it is that they
[03:37:42.700 --> 03:37:47.460]  want in terms of we weren't even we weren't even honest about you know what
[03:37:47.460 --> 03:37:53.060]  we were really doing I mean I would I would you know I was being paid so for
[03:37:53.060 --> 03:37:59.340]  every woman that I got to consent to to participate in this research I got paid
[03:37:59.340 --> 03:38:06.300]  20 bucks so that certainly lends itself to manipulative or coercive language oh
[03:38:06.300 --> 03:38:10.620]  yeah you incentivize sure I mean yeah yeah oh you want to do this this is
[03:38:10.620 --> 03:38:15.300]  nothing it's gonna help save the lives of other people when in actuality we
[03:38:15.300 --> 03:38:20.060]  know that fetal tissue hasn't had any major medical breakthroughs since the
[03:38:20.060 --> 03:38:23.340]  inception of the research so and they can do stem cell research on adults
[03:38:23.340 --> 03:38:26.620]  themselves yes they don't need to have the baby stem that's right and there
[03:38:26.620 --> 03:38:31.980]  actually have been significant medical breakthroughs because of adult themselves
[03:38:31.980 --> 03:38:36.620]  which is always harvested in an ethical way mm-hmm and of course that would
[03:38:36.620 --> 03:38:39.620]  there's this article here why I didn't cover it in the news but a blood test
[03:38:39.620 --> 03:38:43.100]  that allows couples to screen out what they call abnormalities this is a
[03:38:43.100 --> 03:38:47.700]  Spanish firm I genomics has made a compatibility test it costs about 1800
[03:38:47.700 --> 03:38:53.340]  pounds it's available in Britain so I guess you can if it's abnormalities or
[03:38:53.340 --> 03:38:57.660]  if it's maybe hair color you want a different baby with a different hair
[03:38:57.660 --> 03:39:01.060]  color different sex or whatever just just have an abortion yeah there's a
[03:39:01.060 --> 03:39:06.820]  little Aryan to me little Hitler Hitler ask yeah me designer babies getting what
[03:39:06.820 --> 03:39:11.540]  you want exactly that's that's where this is essentially going to lead and of
[03:39:11.540 --> 03:39:14.900]  course we have seen that in the history of Planned Parenthood as well we've
[03:39:14.900 --> 03:39:19.460]  seen that it was targeted to certain groups targeted to the black community of
[03:39:19.460 --> 03:39:23.100]  course that was Margaret Singer was very clear about that I want to get your
[03:39:23.100 --> 03:39:26.380]  comment before we talk about what's going on here in the state of Texas about
[03:39:26.380 --> 03:39:31.660]  this recent article from Politico talking about how the raw video has now
[03:39:31.660 --> 03:39:35.140]  been leaked out of a house committee and they were telling everybody hey don't
[03:39:35.140 --> 03:39:38.900]  pay any attention to these videos from the Center for Medical Progress don't
[03:39:38.900 --> 03:39:42.820]  pay any attention to that because those have been heavily edited and yet they
[03:39:42.820 --> 03:39:50.380]  don't want the raw footage out there if they've got nothing to hide then who
[03:39:50.380 --> 03:39:54.780]  cares right why why go to these extreme lengths to make sure that the videos
[03:39:54.780 --> 03:39:59.180]  don't come out if everything they're doing is to help the general public
[03:39:59.180 --> 03:40:02.340]  through the research I mean and that that's kind of the thing I mean I guess
[03:40:02.340 --> 03:40:05.260]  I worked in Planned Parenthood media for a while but I mean I've just been
[03:40:05.260 --> 03:40:10.300]  thinking the whole time why don't they just come out and say yeah we do this
[03:40:10.300 --> 03:40:15.860]  yep we do it yep we have cavalier conversations about aborting babies at
[03:40:15.860 --> 03:40:20.660]  dinner yep that is absolutely what we do and and that's part of our work and
[03:40:20.660 --> 03:40:24.740]  and we're proud of it because we are proud to perform abortions I mean that's
[03:40:24.740 --> 03:40:28.020]  really what they should just come out and stay instead of trying to hide it and
[03:40:28.020 --> 03:40:32.660]  suppress it and you know make all of these excuses just come on out with it I
[03:40:32.660 --> 03:40:36.020]  mean if you're really proud of what you do if you really believe abortion is
[03:40:36.020 --> 03:40:40.380]  this great service if you really believe that that harvesting fetal tissue from
[03:40:40.380 --> 03:40:44.700]  these aborted babies is a good thing and just own it and be proud of it yeah
[03:40:44.700 --> 03:40:49.660]  yeah some of them do actually and it's actually that's actually really creepy
[03:40:49.660 --> 03:40:53.420]  when you when you see that happen talk to us about what's going on here in the
[03:40:53.420 --> 03:40:56.380]  state of Texas of course this is something that's going on in multiple
[03:40:56.380 --> 03:40:59.700]  states we're not seeing any real investigation at the federal level in
[03:40:59.700 --> 03:41:04.460]  spite of the fact this committee is looking at these videos that's the only
[03:41:04.460 --> 03:41:06.900]  thing that we've seen in of course that's Republican committee who's doing that
[03:41:06.900 --> 03:41:11.340]  the Justice Department is not doing any investigation to see if they violated
[03:41:11.340 --> 03:41:18.420]  US law by by negotiating for for organ parts or if they are performing late
[03:41:18.420 --> 03:41:21.700]  term abortions as we see in these videos because they want more fully
[03:41:21.700 --> 03:41:25.540]  developed body parts those would all be violations of existing law they're
[03:41:25.540 --> 03:41:28.620]  just they're starting to look at that in the House committee but they're not the
[03:41:28.620 --> 03:41:31.620]  the Obama administration the Department of Justice are not looking at that but
[03:41:31.620 --> 03:41:35.020]  we do have some states that are looking at that tell us about Texas yeah it's
[03:41:35.020 --> 03:41:38.340]  been really exciting actually you know we had already defunded in the state of
[03:41:38.340 --> 03:41:42.500]  Texas we had already defunded Planned Parenthood of 29 million dollars but
[03:41:42.500 --> 03:41:47.340]  there was still like two and a half million left and you know we just kept
[03:41:47.340 --> 03:41:51.580]  being told we just can't pull it CMS will come in and you know they'll shut
[03:41:51.580 --> 03:41:55.700]  down your whole Medicaid program but but certainly there has to be some
[03:41:55.700 --> 03:42:01.020]  allowance for a state to say you're breaking the law we don't want you as
[03:42:01.020 --> 03:42:05.580]  part of our Medicaid program right but you've got to have pretty solid evidence
[03:42:05.580 --> 03:42:10.700]  that they are breaking the law so the office of the investigator journalist
[03:42:10.700 --> 03:42:15.580]  by the way we have a new IG Stuart Bowen amazing man really on top of this and
[03:42:15.580 --> 03:42:19.060]  it's not just that he's you know I'm pro-life so I want to shut down Planned
[03:42:19.060 --> 03:42:24.900]  Parenthood he's like I I want to make sure that we are being responsible with
[03:42:24.900 --> 03:42:30.380]  taxpayer dollars here in the state of Texas and he's really going about it
[03:42:30.380 --> 03:42:35.980]  the right way you know he started looking at we've got three whistleblower
[03:42:35.980 --> 03:42:41.180]  lawsuits mine is is one of them from from former Planned Parenthood workers
[03:42:41.180 --> 03:42:48.380]  stating Medicaid fraud very I mean serious Medicaid fraud if we if if my
[03:42:48.380 --> 03:42:52.740]  case goes to court and we win the affiliate that I worked with Planned
[03:42:52.740 --> 03:42:56.180]  Parenthood Gulf Coast they're going to be fined about 600 million dollars wow
[03:42:56.180 --> 03:43:02.620]  this is big money okay and this is our money mm-hmm and so you know basically
[03:43:02.620 --> 03:43:08.340]  the the OIG said look we're gonna we're gonna look into this you know we have
[03:43:08.340 --> 03:43:12.460]  the videos showing this but but we need some we need some hard proof and these
[03:43:12.460 --> 03:43:16.820]  former clinic workers have that hard proof and so they've been looking
[03:43:16.820 --> 03:43:23.980]  through you know our complaint our allegations our cases and and then they
[03:43:23.980 --> 03:43:27.940]  finally they went in there they stepped foot in there and said we're taking the
[03:43:27.940 --> 03:43:32.900]  records we need and a surprise surprise the only affiliate that wasn't
[03:43:32.900 --> 03:43:36.780]  cooperative was Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast and that happened out of Houston
[03:43:36.780 --> 03:43:41.460]  that happens to be where all three of the former employees came from so they
[03:43:41.460 --> 03:43:43.900]  don't want to be cooperative they don't they don't want us to see what's going
[03:43:43.900 --> 03:43:46.700]  on in there so you say they weren't cooperative what did they do well they
[03:43:46.700 --> 03:43:51.260]  were trying to prevent the OIG from getting the records but I mean they have
[03:43:51.260 --> 03:43:54.620]  the power they're they're part of the Medicaid contract so they have the power
[03:43:54.620 --> 03:43:57.900]  to get whatever they want and of course that that's that's legitimate if it's
[03:43:57.900 --> 03:44:02.780]  part of if somebody accuses them of wrongdoing it would be negligent on the
[03:44:02.780 --> 03:44:06.060]  part of the Attorney General not to investigate it absolutely you know and
[03:44:06.060 --> 03:44:10.820]  so that's what we see repeatedly yet they talk about this as if they're being
[03:44:10.820 --> 03:44:14.900]  targeted unfairly unjustly we heard the same thing about the videos themselves
[03:44:14.900 --> 03:44:18.340]  oh you know they came in they lied to people about this I think it's like no
[03:44:18.340 --> 03:44:22.900]  if you have it's not entrapment if somebody has said something is
[03:44:22.900 --> 03:44:26.860]  happening here and you do an undercover investigation the FBI does that kind of
[03:44:26.860 --> 03:44:29.980]  stuff all the time and it's not entrapment if somebody says hey there's a
[03:44:29.980 --> 03:44:34.500]  crime being committed here you need to investigate this then it's legitimate to
[03:44:34.500 --> 03:44:39.580]  go in and do an undercover investigation even if you represent yourself as
[03:44:39.580 --> 03:44:42.940]  that's the only way that they do most of these investigations and so that kind of
[03:44:42.940 --> 03:44:48.020]  investigation going in and looking at the records of an organization once
[03:44:48.020 --> 03:44:51.940]  they've been accused of wrongdoing that's a legitimate thing to do but the
[03:44:51.940 --> 03:44:56.980]  left is and the apologists for Planned Parenthood are going apoplectic about
[03:44:56.980 --> 03:45:02.220]  this oh poor Planned Parenthood yeah yeah poor billion dollar nonprofit yeah
[03:45:02.220 --> 03:45:06.620]  and I mean that's just what's so disingenuous about the whole thing is
[03:45:06.620 --> 03:45:10.100]  Planned Parenthood they they love to play the victim they need to play the
[03:45:10.100 --> 03:45:15.020]  victim in order to keep their support going you know we're just always trying
[03:45:15.020 --> 03:45:20.420]  to to to shut them down and you know poor us and we're always a target yeah
[03:45:20.420 --> 03:45:25.220]  you are always a target because you're killing babies and you are always a
[03:45:25.220 --> 03:45:28.740]  target because you're giving substandard health care to women who come into your
[03:45:28.740 --> 03:45:33.260]  facilities and you are a target because you continue to promote and participate
[03:45:33.260 --> 03:45:37.180]  in the legal activity yeah you better believe you're absolutely a target and
[03:45:37.180 --> 03:45:41.260]  you're gonna continue to be a target until we can find enough evidence to shut
[03:45:41.260 --> 03:45:44.660]  you down permanently. You're talking about substandard health care I mean one of
[03:45:44.660 --> 03:45:48.340]  the things that came to light in these undercover videos is the fact that they
[03:45:48.340 --> 03:45:53.180]  would encourage the women to have a breached birth so they could get a
[03:45:53.180 --> 03:45:58.180]  better quote-unquote specimen as they term the baby yeah I mean and that's not
[03:45:58.180 --> 03:46:02.380]  all I mean look we've got we have where I run an organization for abortion clinic
[03:46:02.380 --> 03:46:08.420]  workers so that they can leave and find hope and find healing and find a life
[03:46:08.420 --> 03:46:13.380]  affirming job away from the abortion industry and you know the things that
[03:46:13.380 --> 03:46:17.820]  these workers are coming out and telling us that's going on inside the clinics
[03:46:17.820 --> 03:46:22.100]  there was an inspection that we just got every every six months we'll do a
[03:46:22.100 --> 03:46:25.980]  public information request and and ask for the inspection reports because those
[03:46:25.980 --> 03:46:32.060]  are public record so the inspectors that go into these abortion clinics and we
[03:46:32.060 --> 03:46:37.900]  get inspections back all the time that say they are not properly sterilizing
[03:46:37.900 --> 03:46:42.300]  instruments these are instruments are going inside a woman that are being
[03:46:42.300 --> 03:46:47.940]  used woman to woman they are not being properly sterilized and this may be a
[03:46:47.940 --> 03:46:51.660]  problem that continues to happen year after year yet these abortion clinics
[03:46:51.660 --> 03:46:57.700]  are still allowed to stay open I mean they are putting women at very serious
[03:46:57.700 --> 03:47:04.220]  risk and very serious danger and look at the way the the the Planned Parenthood
[03:47:04.220 --> 03:47:08.340]  Apologist reacted to the laws that that would try to correct that type of
[03:47:08.340 --> 03:47:11.340]  situation yeah they said oh you're just doing that because you don't want us to
[03:47:11.340 --> 03:47:15.620]  have abortions and they're not concerned about women's health it came out at the
[03:47:15.620 --> 03:47:20.180]  time that is about that time that Joan Rivers died having plastic surgery and
[03:47:20.180 --> 03:47:24.460]  they pointed out that if those same standards had been applied to where she
[03:47:24.460 --> 03:47:28.180]  was having plastic surgery then that wouldn't have happened to her she would
[03:47:28.180 --> 03:47:31.020]  have survived though you know they would have the kind of oversight that they
[03:47:31.020 --> 03:47:35.140]  needed with that but they're not concerned about women's health they're
[03:47:35.140 --> 03:47:38.540]  just concerned about having more abortions and you could see it from
[03:47:38.540 --> 03:47:44.260]  their resistance to this legislation oh yeah I mean and it was so pathetic is
[03:47:44.260 --> 03:47:48.100]  that these clinics they can't even keep up with the very minimum standards that
[03:47:48.100 --> 03:47:53.460]  that are in place right now but they say that they care about women they're not
[03:47:53.460 --> 03:47:56.460]  even properly sterilizing their instruments but they're trying to
[03:47:56.460 --> 03:48:00.860]  convince me that they care about women I mean gosh you've got women coming in
[03:48:00.860 --> 03:48:05.740]  there who are HIV positive who have other sexually transmitted I mean serious
[03:48:05.740 --> 03:48:10.140]  diseases and they're not even properly cleaning the instruments that are going
[03:48:10.140 --> 03:48:14.900]  inside one woman and the next I mean that's disgusting they don't have we
[03:48:14.900 --> 03:48:18.420]  just got one inspection back they're all of their life-saving equipment their
[03:48:18.420 --> 03:48:23.180]  airway equipment all of that the defibrillator all that had not been
[03:48:23.180 --> 03:48:29.260]  inspected since 2010 I mean God forbid a woman actually needed it they pull it
[03:48:29.260 --> 03:48:33.580]  out doesn't even work I mean I'm telling you these clinics they are so they are
[03:48:33.580 --> 03:48:38.020]  is such poor care for women and they're not even providing the services that
[03:48:38.020 --> 03:48:40.820]  they say they're providing they're saying that they're providing all this
[03:48:40.820 --> 03:48:45.460]  comprehensive care for women that's ridiculous they are not providing half of
[03:48:45.460 --> 03:48:50.540]  the care that probably they're not providing 75% of the care that their
[03:48:50.540 --> 03:48:55.820]  apologists are saying that they do and if you try to tell them that oh I mean
[03:48:55.820 --> 03:49:00.700]  they just they can't stand they can't take it they cannot take you trying to
[03:49:00.700 --> 03:49:04.020]  shut down their precious Planned Parenthood even though there are better
[03:49:04.020 --> 03:49:08.140]  providers for them to go and see exactly when they're talking about women's
[03:49:08.140 --> 03:49:11.260]  health and that's the line they always come back if you cut funding for Planned
[03:49:11.260 --> 03:49:15.260]  Parenthood you're going to be cutting funding for women's health but again we
[03:49:15.260 --> 03:49:17.980]  go back to it and we say are you we're concerned about women's health we want
[03:49:17.980 --> 03:49:20.900]  to make sure that their that their equipment is up to date that they have
[03:49:20.900 --> 03:49:25.060]  all these other things that in case something goes wrong they say oh you
[03:49:25.060 --> 03:49:28.380]  just want to stop abortions because they know that's why they're supporting
[03:49:28.380 --> 03:49:34.020]  Planned Parenthood. Yeah it was interesting the NARAL or NAF or one of
[03:49:34.020 --> 03:49:39.420]  the pro-abortion groups came out not too long ago they said it was like this
[03:49:39.420 --> 03:49:44.540]  this shocking pro-lifer is trying to shut down the abortion industry and I
[03:49:44.540 --> 03:49:49.100]  thought is that really shocking because yeah that is exactly what we're trying
[03:49:49.100 --> 03:49:53.980]  to do and you know I don't I don't want to cut women's health care I want to
[03:49:53.980 --> 03:49:57.980]  make sure women are getting proper health care and and comprehensive
[03:49:57.980 --> 03:50:01.300]  health care when they do go to a medical office and they're not going to get that
[03:50:01.300 --> 03:50:04.660]  at Planned Parenthood they're going to get dirty instruments they're going to
[03:50:04.660 --> 03:50:07.700]  get they're not even going to be seen by a doctor I mean a doctor in the building
[03:50:07.700 --> 03:50:10.820]  if you go to Planned Parenthood for health care you know I want to make
[03:50:10.820 --> 03:50:13.860]  sure that women are getting the best care here in the state of Texas alone
[03:50:13.860 --> 03:50:20.220]  there are only 35 Planned Parenthood clinics there are almost 5,000 providers
[03:50:20.220 --> 03:50:24.260]  for the Texas women's health program where women can go to receive health care
[03:50:24.260 --> 03:50:28.340]  at no cost I mean we really don't need Planned Parenthood in the state of Texas
[03:50:28.340 --> 03:50:32.660]  I mean we have said that over and over again our legislators have proven it we
[03:50:32.660 --> 03:50:36.980]  do not need these clinics in our state. Stay with us when we come back we're
[03:50:36.980 --> 03:50:40.820]  talking about Planned Parenthood and government subsidies and of course it's
[03:50:40.820 --> 03:50:45.220]  not just federal subsidies even state subsidies it's also local subsidies and
[03:50:45.220 --> 03:50:48.180]  we'll talk about a good example that when we come back we're talking to Abby

[03:54:10.860 --> 03:54:15.060]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show our final segment we have Abby Johnson
[03:54:15.060 --> 03:54:19.220]  with us she's a Planned Parenthood whistleblower former manager at a Planned
[03:54:19.220 --> 03:54:23.780]  Parenthood facility in Houston and I want to talk to her about funding at the
[03:54:23.780 --> 03:54:27.140]  local level before we do I just want to let you know that we have super mail
[03:54:27.140 --> 03:54:32.580]  vitality back in stock and we also have 15% off of ancient defense as well as

[03:54:47.020 --> 03:54:52.460]  ancient defense and super mail vitality is back in stock now Abby as we were
[03:54:52.460 --> 03:54:55.580]  talking about efforts to try to limit funding and of course it's been done at
[03:54:55.580 --> 03:55:00.780]  the state level here in Texas there's also heavy subsidies at the local level
[03:55:00.780 --> 03:55:04.940]  I think people aren't aware of Austin is a very good example tell us what's going
[03:55:04.940 --> 03:55:09.260]  on here in Austin with local subsidy of Planned Parenthood yeah Austin is you
[03:55:09.260 --> 03:55:13.060]  know they have before they've they funded Planned Parenthood locally before and
[03:55:13.060 --> 03:55:16.660]  then they then they stop now they're back to doing it and other thing I think
[03:55:16.660 --> 03:55:23.860]  people don't realize is there's a building downtown in Austin the rent for
[03:55:23.860 --> 03:55:28.300]  a building like this for the square footage would probably go for you know
[03:55:28.300 --> 03:55:34.060]  I don't know maybe four to five thousand a month the city of Austin for years for
[03:55:34.060 --> 03:55:38.980]  at least 20 30 years has been renting that building to Planned Parenthood for
[03:55:38.980 --> 03:55:47.340]  a dollar a year I mean it's a huge subsidy yeah absolutely and then you know
[03:55:47.340 --> 03:55:52.020]  part of our local taxes they want that to go to Planned Parenthood and you know
[03:55:52.020 --> 03:55:56.940]  I mean I have to say I remember when we were moving to this area and we were
[03:55:56.940 --> 03:56:01.060]  looking at you know where we wanted to buy a house one of the things that we
[03:56:01.060 --> 03:56:06.100]  looked at was you know is the local government there giving subsidies to
[03:56:06.100 --> 03:56:09.660]  Planned Parenthood that time when we moved here Travis County was the city of
[03:56:09.660 --> 03:56:15.940]  Austin was and so we we ended up moving intentionally moved more north into
[03:56:15.940 --> 03:56:20.460]  Williamson County because we didn't want any of our money going to to Planned
[03:56:20.460 --> 03:56:23.660]  Parenthood at the local level and I think people need to pay attention to
[03:56:23.660 --> 03:56:26.380]  that people need to start paying attention that where is your local money
[03:56:26.380 --> 03:56:31.180]  going is it going to fund things like the abortion industry and here in Austin
[03:56:31.180 --> 03:56:34.780]  it is I think most people wouldn't even think to look for that yeah you know how
[03:56:34.780 --> 03:56:37.540]  the system works because you worked at a Planned Parenthood most people wouldn't
[03:56:37.540 --> 03:56:42.220]  even imagine that they're getting a several thousand square foot facility
[03:56:42.220 --> 03:56:47.700]  for a dollar a year in Austin that is absolutely amazing and that shows just
[03:56:47.700 --> 03:56:53.260]  how much how politically correct connected they are that people would
[03:56:53.260 --> 03:56:57.260]  give them this kind of subsidy and I think a lot of people even people that
[03:56:57.260 --> 03:57:01.620]  might support abortion many libertarians would look at this and say wait a minute
[03:57:01.620 --> 03:57:06.540]  why are we giving these people that much of a subsidy right for their business I
[03:57:06.540 --> 03:57:10.180]  mean the same type of thing we look at with sports stadiums where you got these
[03:57:10.180 --> 03:57:14.180]  multi-billionaires come in with their sports team and you build a billion dollar
[03:57:14.180 --> 03:57:18.300]  stadium for them I mean we see this kind of crony capitalism at every level and
[03:57:18.300 --> 03:57:20.820]  certainly it's there with Planned Parenthood I think a lot of people need
[03:57:20.820 --> 03:57:24.700]  to look at that at the local level so we're going to be talking tonight on the
[03:57:24.700 --> 03:57:29.180]  nightly news Leanne McAdoo is going to be talking about the Texas raids of a
[03:57:29.180 --> 03:57:33.900]  Planned Parenthood there's also going to be an extended version of Alex
[03:57:33.900 --> 03:57:39.540]  storming Google that's don't miss that video because it's absolutely priceless
[03:57:39.540 --> 03:57:44.060]  to see the expression on people's faces when you put a camera and a microphone
[03:57:44.060 --> 03:57:48.500]  in their face even the guy who has a laptop in front of him with a camera and
[03:57:48.500 --> 03:57:53.700]  a microphone he doesn't think about it until Alex does that that is essentially
[03:57:53.700 --> 03:57:58.380]  what is happening to all of us we're all being recorded all the time by Google
[03:57:58.380 --> 03:58:02.860]  and that information now with the passage of CISA is going to be turned over to
[03:58:02.860 --> 03:58:06.780]  the government as the government wishes that's what you need to be afraid of
[03:58:06.780 --> 03:58:10.860]  thank you so much for joining us Abby Johnson Planned Parenthood whistleblower
[03:58:10.860 --> 03:58:14.320]  join us tonight at 7 central 8 p.m. Eastern Leanne McAdoo will be doing the
