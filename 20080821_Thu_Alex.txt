[01:50.880 --> 01:56.640]  least the beginnings of what could bring them into some type of justice for their criminal

[02:07.760 --> 02:15.000]  talking about that today as well but I want to take a lot of your phone calls any issue any
[02:15.000 --> 02:21.160]  subject any discussion you would like to have give a question a comment or a point you'd like to
[02:21.160 --> 02:27.720]  make or a particular news item never watch Washington Journal on C-SPAN of course the host
[02:27.720 --> 02:31.160]  aren't like me they hardly talk they just sit there and listen to you for a minute or so and
[02:31.160 --> 02:36.600]  then hang up on you maybe that's the only way for us to take a lot of calls on this show is for
[02:36.600 --> 02:43.960]  me to just sit there and say nothing and go thank you caller maybe I'll I don't think I can do that
[02:43.960 --> 02:47.280]  because the callers are gonna ask me questions and then I'm gonna want to elaborate I'm gonna
[02:47.280 --> 02:54.360]  try to keep my my my answers down to 30 seconds how's that sound short answer theater here we'll
[02:54.360 --> 03:05.720]  see what happens 1-800-259-9231 1-800-259-9231 and we'll get you up and on the air
[03:05.720 --> 03:15.520]  of course our vaunted websites are info wars.com prisonplanet.com and prisonplanet.tv as well
[03:15.520 --> 03:21.480]  as info wars.net and jonesreport.com I was on Tom Martino's radio show till 40 after today and
[03:21.480 --> 03:27.840]  then raced from my house over to the studio and I they took like I don't know four or five
[03:27.840 --> 03:31.920]  phone calls while I was on every caller agreed including a police officer that called in and
[03:31.920 --> 03:37.880]  others about government sponsored terror and how they're federalizing the police now the shadow
[03:37.880 --> 03:43.280]  government is basically eating the rest of the country so I just wanted to briefly break down
[03:43.280 --> 03:48.640]  continue government why the new world order likes it why they're setting it up and we will
[03:48.640 --> 03:56.160]  break that down on the other side of this quick break and then go to your phone calls at 1-800-259-9231
[03:56.160 --> 04:01.600]  and I really have been getting better and better at actually taking the calls and going to them
[04:01.600 --> 04:06.440]  quickly I'd say five six an hour when I'm taking them that's not very quick is it so I'm going to
[04:06.440 --> 04:11.440]  try to I've done it a few times successfully we'll see if one of those is those days I know we
[04:11.440 --> 04:18.760]  always get unlimited phone calls 1-800-259-9231 you know I even have my own phone system here in
[04:18.760 --> 04:23.360]  my own office and if I open it up and give the number out once you can open it for five seconds
[04:23.360 --> 04:30.760]  and 20 phone calls will come in or more you we've opened it for like 30 seconds before and had
[04:30.760 --> 04:36.880]  like 3040 overwhelming the system we only have five phone lines actually six at Genesis so
[04:36.880 --> 04:44.280]  1-800-259-9231 and what you can do is when you hear somebody hang up that's your chance to dial in
[04:44.280 --> 04:48.520]  real fast but by taking more of your calls it gives us a chance to actually get to them all in
[04:48.520 --> 04:52.400]  fact I'm just going to come to your calls right when we get back and I'll get to continue government
[04:52.400 --> 05:00.880]  at the bottom of the hour stay with us

[13:21.320 --> 13:22.980]  woke up to all this stuff after
[13:22.980 --> 13:24.800]  seven plus years of
[13:24.800 --> 13:26.980]  uh... throwing it back in my face about how
[13:26.980 --> 13:29.920]  all it can never be you know nine eleven can have been inside job i i could
[13:29.920 --> 13:31.700]  never believe my own government ball up
[13:31.700 --> 13:34.540]  so it takes many many years in cases but
[13:34.540 --> 13:37.920]  uh... there are success stories and it feels good every time it works so keep up
[13:37.920 --> 13:38.680]  the good work
[13:38.680 --> 13:40.920]  i hear you and i appreciate your call
[13:40.920 --> 13:42.640]  james great point yell
[13:42.640 --> 13:45.320]  what would happen

[13:49.760 --> 13:51.480]  millions
[13:51.480 --> 13:53.840]  if you went to
[13:53.840 --> 13:56.620]  the local toy store ordered
[13:56.620 --> 14:00.800]  slave mart or the police state target stores
[14:00.800 --> 14:04.160]  and you marched in there and you bought one of those little three dollar boxes of
[14:04.160 --> 14:07.100]  whatever they cost up by for my children a couple bucks
[14:07.100 --> 14:11.120]  a whole box of chalk red chalk blue chalk green chalk pink chalk
[14:11.120 --> 14:13.640]  white chalk

[14:26.300 --> 14:29.620]  pictures for people
[14:29.620 --> 14:34.280]  and it's really a great idea and i've never consciously thought of doing that
[14:34.280 --> 14:37.100]  that is thought of telling listeners to do it i just keep seeing
[14:37.100 --> 14:40.800]  sidewalk chalk pop up in austin with political messages i see all of the
[14:40.800 --> 14:44.320]  web people take photos of it
[14:44.320 --> 14:47.800]  and yes it's very very very effective good job james

[15:04.880 --> 15:08.960]  but uh... anyway i was i just had uh... about two things i wanted to mention
[15:08.960 --> 15:10.640]  uh... real quick to you
[15:10.640 --> 15:13.320]  uh... excuse me one of the question
[15:13.320 --> 15:14.480]  and that is
[15:14.480 --> 15:18.080]  if you thought about having another info or as money bomb anytime in the near
[15:18.080 --> 15:21.720]  future because i have to spend that money first i mean i've got the office
[15:21.720 --> 15:23.880]  i'm i'm trying to hire people
[15:23.880 --> 15:27.800]  i'm trying to buy cameras and hook them up and build a studio
[15:27.800 --> 15:30.680]  uh... and so i'm just trying to get that first
[15:30.680 --> 15:32.240]  mission done
[15:32.240 --> 15:35.160]  instead of just piling up by you know some money
[15:35.160 --> 15:38.840]  now now now now that money's all for the tv show and for the and for the new
[15:38.840 --> 15:41.800]  office and things we could have done without your listeners
[15:41.800 --> 15:45.520]  uh... i do have some other projects and and if it looks like we start running
[15:45.520 --> 15:46.840]  out of that money
[15:46.840 --> 15:48.960]  i've already spent about sixty thousand of it
[15:48.960 --> 15:53.360]  uh... then i will ask for more and i do need to see that money's all earmarked
[15:53.360 --> 15:54.420]  for that mission
[15:54.420 --> 15:57.880]  i do need people to keep buying the books and videos and materials
[15:57.880 --> 16:00.080]  not just because it supports us but because
[16:00.080 --> 16:02.080]  he gets the word out like
[16:02.080 --> 16:03.280]  fabled enemies
[16:03.280 --> 16:07.320]  but you can now pre-order they'll be shipping in just ten days now

[16:10.320 --> 16:12.920]  but yes we will probably in the future
[16:12.920 --> 16:14.920]  uh... do uh... a money bomb
[16:14.920 --> 16:15.840]  that's great
[16:15.840 --> 16:19.840]  alec uh... on uh... george norris show coast to coast with what you're well
[16:19.840 --> 16:21.240]  familiar course
[16:21.240 --> 16:26.280]  uh... about a year ago maybe a little longer he had a guest on name a fellow
[16:26.280 --> 16:28.840]  named stewart swerdlow it's uh...
[16:28.840 --> 16:32.760]  it's a russian name an ethnic russian name it's it's sb
[16:32.760 --> 16:34.600]  e d
[16:34.600 --> 16:39.400]  or e rd l o w i believe or something like that's where it's swerdlow
[16:39.400 --> 16:43.920]  swerdlow and i was wondering if you had heard of project bluebeam as anybody
[16:43.920 --> 16:47.080]  mentioned that are you found that yes i have heard of your secret government
[16:47.080 --> 16:49.240]  programs and they are real
[16:49.240 --> 16:53.160]  to create fake flying saucer phenomenon and i happen to be driving home last
[16:53.160 --> 16:54.200]  night
[16:54.200 --> 16:57.480]  and uh... heard coast to coast and where he had the guest on
[16:57.480 --> 17:01.200]  who for four years running has these you fake ufo contest
[17:01.200 --> 17:04.200]  that can fool police fool anybody
[17:04.200 --> 17:07.000]  and they're talking about for a few hundred bucks you can fool
[17:07.000 --> 17:08.920]  you know uh... folks
[17:08.920 --> 17:13.120]  you can fool people and show yes there are government programs declassified
[17:13.120 --> 17:15.060]  to project to jesus
[17:15.060 --> 17:17.880]  with holograms included a mohammed
[17:17.880 --> 17:22.520]  uh... that was all declassified in nineteen ninety four
[17:22.520 --> 17:26.800]  remember seeing it in of all places i think popular mechanics
[17:26.800 --> 17:31.440]  as they call them a laser holograms here with the laser uh... faster than that
[17:31.440 --> 17:34.120]  technology of holographic imaging
[17:34.120 --> 17:38.760]  and i believe that it would be uh... uh... basically transmitted a projected
[17:38.760 --> 17:41.160]  through a satellite of the means of
[17:41.160 --> 17:45.160]  amplification in order to create a really large holographic image in the
[17:45.160 --> 17:49.040]  sky that could be seen by perhaps millions of people are even uh... you
[17:49.040 --> 17:50.320]  know they will
[17:50.320 --> 17:53.360]  one half of the world for how well that's right and the phoenix lights are
[17:53.360 --> 17:54.360]  clearly
[17:54.360 --> 17:58.400]  just some amateurs uh... with holographic smaller lasers and you can see
[17:58.400 --> 17:59.760]  those are holograms
[17:59.760 --> 18:04.240]  uh... and then and then we've had this this thing three football fields long
[18:04.240 --> 18:05.960]  drifting over dentin north of dallas
[18:05.960 --> 18:09.440]  uh... and i mean i had family that saw a gigantic flying saucer
[18:09.440 --> 18:13.600]  uh... but uh... talk to a lot of folks before that happened to see the giant
[18:13.600 --> 18:14.840]  blimp
[18:14.840 --> 18:18.040]  and that's really what it is is like some big blimp they lower down
[18:18.040 --> 18:19.840]  and shine some lights on
[18:19.840 --> 18:22.400]  and i thought we would have looked at and they say it looks fake it doesn't
[18:22.400 --> 18:24.960]  really look it moves around like a blimp
[18:24.960 --> 18:28.680]  uh... and i'm not saying there aren't aliens folks i just don't get into it
[18:28.680 --> 18:34.120]  we know there's government programs for fake ufo's and jesus and everything else
[18:34.120 --> 18:37.880]  and uh... it's part of the it's a project in the russians have talked about
[18:37.880 --> 18:38.820]  this
[18:38.820 --> 18:40.280]  in fact
[18:40.280 --> 18:43.120]  uh... was about four years ago they had a
[18:43.120 --> 18:45.040]  annual i have to watch
[18:45.040 --> 18:48.080]  online some of it they've been having every year for a long time
[18:48.080 --> 18:50.320]  since shoemaker levy
[18:50.320 --> 18:52.880]  when they saw that plunge into uh...
[18:52.880 --> 18:54.680]  saturn
[18:54.680 --> 18:56.340]  that giant comment
[18:56.340 --> 18:59.600]  and then that once of all prove that giant objects don't hit every million
[18:59.600 --> 19:01.440]  years they're hitting every couple hundred years
[19:01.440 --> 19:03.180]  just like what hit in
[19:03.180 --> 19:05.480]  no hundred years ago inside barrier that
[19:05.480 --> 19:07.720]  destroyed thousands of square miles
[19:07.720 --> 19:11.600]  uh... was a uh... some of the asteroid or comet that blew up
[19:11.600 --> 19:13.240]  vaporized uh...
[19:13.240 --> 19:16.080]  and and so basically the same effect as a nuclear weapon
[19:16.080 --> 19:20.080]  with an airburst uh... type phenomenon
[19:20.080 --> 19:23.120]  so they're having global conferences and they said
[19:23.120 --> 19:25.920]  uh... publicly uh...
[19:25.920 --> 19:29.440]  it was the global union conference in russia i'll whatever year it was it was
[19:29.440 --> 19:30.400]  in russia now
[19:30.400 --> 19:31.760]  and it was proposed
[19:31.760 --> 19:34.800]  but yes this could you know five s for world government
[19:34.800 --> 19:37.360]  in the name of shooting down asteroids
[19:37.360 --> 19:40.980]  anything that's a outside threat they said well aliens is even better

[19:43.400 --> 19:46.160]  uh... that is certainly being looked at there certainly with the pope coming
[19:46.160 --> 19:47.960]  out and saying aliens are real and
[19:47.960 --> 19:49.760]  everybody else saying it's real
[19:49.760 --> 19:53.400]  something is going on there getting people ready for something

[24:20.400 --> 24:25.560]  angles directions to grab that brings up topics that we would never get to here
[24:25.560 --> 24:30.800]  on the show but it's the catch 22 I'm gonna get to everybody I've got to have
[24:30.800 --> 24:35.400]  brevity I'm talking to myself there Alex stop it be brief
[24:35.400 --> 24:41.640]  Bill in Texas you're on the air go ahead yes my wife works for a old folks
[24:41.640 --> 24:45.920]  home that just recently got bought out and they had this meeting where they're
[24:45.920 --> 24:51.400]  gonna start doing random drug testing and they said now if you if you come
[24:51.400 --> 24:54.920]  positive from one of our drug tests we're gonna put you on the no work list
[24:54.920 --> 24:58.360]  and you'll never be able to work again in the United States that's what they're
[24:58.360 --> 25:03.800]  telling their employees and and a lot of those a lot of those are false
[25:03.800 --> 25:08.000]  positives and see all this sounds good but then you're allowed to come up
[25:08.000 --> 25:12.200]  positive for the hundreds of government prescription drugs they push that are
[25:12.200 --> 25:15.960]  even more deadly than most illegal drugs and certainly you know employees that
[25:15.960 --> 25:20.880]  are drug heads are a problem but yes once they start putting you in databases
[25:20.880 --> 25:25.960]  that's a whole nother level and I'm not worried about her flunking but the idea
[25:25.960 --> 25:29.000]  that they're threatening this no work list and is there actually such a list
[25:29.000 --> 25:33.040]  yes they have databases of everything they're run by private contractors it's
[25:33.040 --> 25:37.000]  all criminal it's all hooked into the government they want this info in there
[25:37.000 --> 25:42.800]  it's a it is a new form of slavery just like there's over a million people on
[25:42.800 --> 25:47.440]  the no-fly list and they admit that 99.99% of no connection to terrorists
[25:47.440 --> 25:51.600]  everyone's gonna be put on a list and then you're gonna have to go through
[25:51.600 --> 25:55.280]  government approval to get off of it which will then train you to be
[25:55.280 --> 25:59.640]  registered in book as a trusted traveler trusted worker that was all announced by
[25:59.640 --> 26:06.600]  Homeland Security this is total prison grid well it's like I got turned down
[26:06.600 --> 26:12.120]  for one of those instant FFL checks and now I got to find out how come and it's
[26:12.120 --> 26:15.520]  like well we and I asked a guy how do you do this and he goes I don't know now
[26:15.520 --> 26:19.800]  they're just training you and then see suddenly all these years with the
[26:19.800 --> 26:23.280]  instant check which is a registration and don't let them tell you it isn't the
[26:23.280 --> 26:25.720]  gun shops don't want you to know that because they want to just go along with
[26:25.720 --> 26:28.880]  it and have the second amendment destroyed it's pathetic they think
[26:28.880 --> 26:32.880]  towering is the way to go now let's just be honest the power to regulate and
[26:32.880 --> 26:37.760]  track is the power to destroy and now I'm talking to famous UT football players
[26:37.760 --> 26:42.320]  who are you know from the from the 60s and Daryl Royal championship teams in
[26:42.320 --> 26:47.000]  the 70s and business owners and car dealership owners and restauranteers who
[26:47.000 --> 26:50.360]  can't buy guns and have no criminal record and it's I mean it's not just
[26:50.360 --> 26:54.040]  people calling me in emails it's people I know it's people who are
[26:54.040 --> 26:59.160]  upstanding members of the community I mean it is it's just it's it's it's
[26:59.160 --> 27:04.800]  everywhere it's tyranny it is it we have sown the whirlwind ladies and gentlemen
[27:04.800 --> 27:08.720]  we have sown the win we are reaping the whirlwind and they are going to rape
[27:08.720 --> 27:14.200]  the daylights out of us until we say no and the last thing I have is I used to
[27:14.200 --> 27:18.360]  work in radio and just prepping for a one-hour show I don't see how you do a
[27:18.360 --> 27:22.320]  four-hour I just don't it's a lot of work well the enemy's doing so much evil
[27:22.320 --> 27:26.680]  it's not hard my friend I appreciate your call are you kidding I do a bunch of
[27:26.680 --> 27:30.000]  interviews every day too and then people say you need to do this you need to do
[27:30.000 --> 27:33.360]  that then I'm accused of running the Patriot community when I don't even
[27:33.360 --> 27:37.360]  run my own balancing my own checkbook people think I'm like omnipresent no I
[27:37.360 --> 27:42.400]  just bust my butt let's go ahead and talk to Ian in Florida Ian you're on the
[27:42.400 --> 27:48.400]  air yeah I was going good sir yeah I'm wondering if you watched any of the
[27:48.400 --> 27:52.520]  NIST report they did on the webcast this morning I know I didn't watch the
[27:52.520 --> 27:57.920]  propaganda cast but we are lining up to tomorrow and next week Professor Stephen
[27:57.920 --> 28:04.920]  Jones and of course engineer Kevin Ryan and architect and engineer folks from
[28:04.920 --> 28:09.680]  that organization well I don't know anyone who watched it was it was pretty
[28:09.680 --> 28:13.920]  blatantly pretty much they came to the fact that thermal expansion caused the
[28:13.920 --> 28:18.120]  building to collapse so fire and the steel expanded and it caused the building
[28:18.120 --> 28:22.120]  to collapse yeah you have a bunker building one of the strongest in the
[28:22.120 --> 28:28.680]  country with three sets of structures in it built as a CIA command base the
[28:28.680 --> 28:34.000]  state command base and the city command base and then magically then they did
[28:34.000 --> 28:38.040]  they lie again and say that a third of the building was kept out I know they
[28:38.040 --> 28:44.800]  just set a fire knocked out well they're knocked out but stress one certain
[28:44.800 --> 28:48.540]  column that and then that made the whole building perfectly symmetrically
[28:48.540 --> 28:52.320]  collapsed but they were running simulations and the simulation didn't
[28:52.320 --> 28:56.160]  even go to the video and they cut the simulation off before it even collapsed
[28:56.160 --> 29:00.640]  because it started collapsing forward and instead of imploding and I work in
[29:00.640 --> 29:04.680]  computer graphics and I know a bit about simulations and it's pretty hard if you
[29:04.680 --> 29:11.320]  use an actual physics the budget so well their computer models said that the
[29:11.320 --> 29:19.080]  entire Antarctic this year I was going to melt and that the entire Arctic was
[29:19.080 --> 29:24.160]  going to melt and instead Antarctic got 33% bigger and the Antarctic got bigger
[29:24.160 --> 29:28.680]  so you know like just Al Gore says so so it must be true maybe Al Gore will tell
[29:28.680 --> 29:31.320]  us that the fire made the building fall too maybe they'll tell us infinite the
[29:31.320 --> 29:34.120]  internet maybe he'll tell us the Russians it's not gonna attack Georgia maybe
[29:34.120 --> 29:37.400]  they'll tell us mercury isn't vaccines or that it is and it's good for us maybe
[29:37.400 --> 29:41.720]  they'll tell us that Iraq had WMD's and artificial sweeteners are safe for you
[29:41.720 --> 29:44.320]  to eat and maybe they'll tell you all these kids around us aren't dying of
[29:44.320 --> 29:48.560]  cancers and maybe they'll tell us that oh there's news out major study what's
[29:48.560 --> 29:55.680]  causing diabetes the shots we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones
[29:55.680 --> 30:03.560]  and the GCN radio network our beloved Republic is on her knees the forces of

[33:48.080 --> 33:54.120]  the free world is this a free world that they're setting up no it's a prison
[33:54.120 --> 34:03.620]  one
[34:24.120 --> 34:43.120]  I see a woman in the night with a baby in her hand
[34:43.120 --> 34:50.120]  There's a no street light near a garbage can
[34:50.120 --> 34:54.120]  Now she puts the kid away, she's gonna get a hit
[34:54.120 --> 34:57.120]  She hates her life and what she's gonna do
[34:57.120 --> 35:01.120]  Ain't just one more kid, then I'll never go to school
[35:01.120 --> 35:06.120]  Never get to fall in love, never get to be cool
[35:06.120 --> 35:09.120]  Keep on rockin' in the free world
[35:09.120 --> 35:12.120]  Think about how wicked it is that the criminals have on our government
[35:12.120 --> 35:20.120]  Ship and narcotics in and push the deadly legal drugs on our population
[35:20.120 --> 35:29.120]  And then set their agents upon us to imprison us for our weaknesses
[35:29.120 --> 35:36.120]  For our addictions that they feed and push and sell
[35:36.120 --> 35:41.120]  And it's all about brand naming
[35:41.120 --> 35:51.120]  The war on terror is really the war on freedom
[35:51.120 --> 35:56.120]  Operation Iraqi freedom is really the war on sovereignty
[35:56.120 --> 36:01.120]  It's a genocide war
[36:01.120 --> 36:06.120]  Have you noticed Budweiser now has come out with new bottles and new beer?
[36:06.120 --> 36:10.120]  They're calling it Budweiser American Aval
[36:10.120 --> 36:13.120]  American Pride
[36:13.120 --> 36:17.120]  For the homeless man
[36:17.120 --> 36:22.120]  We got a kinder, gentler machine gun hand
[36:22.120 --> 36:24.120]  Kindler, gentler machine gun hand
[36:24.120 --> 36:28.120]  We got the poppin' stores and toilet paper
[36:28.120 --> 36:32.120]  Got a styrofoam, poppin' store deals on land
[36:32.120 --> 36:36.120]  Don't a man of the people says keep open line
[36:36.120 --> 36:42.120]  There's a problem with the new American Ale brand by Budweiser
[36:42.120 --> 36:44.120]  They never called it American Ale
[36:44.120 --> 36:48.120]  They never called it American, it was just American
[36:48.120 --> 36:54.120]  But now that it's not American, they're going to call it American
[36:54.120 --> 37:01.120]  The big lie, do I care if Budweiser is owned by a Dutch company? No
[37:01.120 --> 37:03.120]  Does it matter?
[37:03.120 --> 37:06.120]  Our roads are being taken over, yes
[37:06.120 --> 37:11.120]  Our ports, our schools, our governments
[37:11.120 --> 37:16.120]  There's an example to all of you yuppies that just can't get it
[37:16.120 --> 37:18.120]  And just can't understand what it is
[37:18.120 --> 37:21.120]  There's the lie, the big lie, right there
[37:21.120 --> 37:25.120]  The minute they take it over, the minute it's not American Ale anymore
[37:25.120 --> 37:28.120]  You know Budweiser for years isn't even real beer
[37:28.120 --> 37:32.120]  They just create an alcoholic syrup that tastes like beer and shoot it into water
[37:32.120 --> 37:34.120]  You know how fresh it is and you go out and buy it
[37:34.120 --> 37:38.120]  Again, it's all frauds, it's all lies, we can't have anything real anymore
[37:38.120 --> 37:42.120]  Not the name, not where it's from, not what it is
[37:42.120 --> 37:51.120]  It's not even beer, it's just a syrup, pop drink with some liquor in it
[37:51.120 --> 37:55.120]  I got a report here I want to get to later about, as we've already seen in studies
[37:55.120 --> 38:04.120]  That massive links to the inoculations and diabetes in children
[38:04.120 --> 38:07.120]  And I just hear it all over talk radio, all over the streets
[38:07.120 --> 38:11.120]  I see the actual numbers as cancer explodes everywhere
[38:11.120 --> 38:17.120]  And I'm just so sad when I hear these parents crying and weeping and begging
[38:17.120 --> 38:20.120]  And trying to save their little three and four and five year olds
[38:20.120 --> 38:26.120]  Dying of cancer, dying of the bioweapon attack, dying from the GMO food
[38:26.120 --> 38:29.120]  Dying from the plagues that are upon us
[38:29.120 --> 38:33.120]  And they're not going to listen to me, they're not going to wake up, they're not going to turn it around
[38:33.120 --> 38:38.120]  That goes for people to work for the government, FBI agents kids are dying, cops kids are dying
[38:38.120 --> 38:42.120]  You're not going to listen, you've got to get hurt real bad by your masters
[38:42.120 --> 38:46.120]  You've got to go to absolute rock bottom before you turn around, don't you?
[38:46.120 --> 38:51.120]  Or maybe not, I mean I have been doing interviews again, I've cut back lately trying to finish some films
[38:51.120 --> 38:54.120]  To only three or four a week, I've been doing a couple of day again
[38:54.120 --> 38:59.120]  And I'm on adversarial radio shows, I'm on neutral radio programs
[38:59.120 --> 39:02.120]  I'm on radio shows that are on my side
[39:02.120 --> 39:07.120]  And almost every caller calls in and agrees with me
[39:07.120 --> 39:12.120]  Police officers call in who the hosts know and say he's telling the truth, we're being federalized
[39:12.120 --> 39:17.120]  I didn't believe it, it's true, there really are provocateurs
[39:17.120 --> 39:20.120]  The stuff he's saying is accurate
[39:20.120 --> 39:27.120]  You see, we can turn it around if we're just man and woman enough to admit what we've turned into
[39:27.120 --> 39:29.120]  What we've become
[39:29.120 --> 39:31.120]  And I'm the best messenger, do I have all the answers?
[39:31.120 --> 39:33.120]  Am I obnoxious, do I make mistakes?
[39:33.120 --> 39:35.120]  Undoubtedly
[39:35.120 --> 39:38.120]  Do I like having to be the mouthpiece here
[39:38.120 --> 39:41.120]  And to have all the attention on me, do I like the danger it brings?
[39:41.120 --> 39:45.120]  Absolutely not, but I am committed to this and I care about each and every one of you out there
[39:45.120 --> 39:48.120]  Do I get angry at you?
[39:48.120 --> 39:50.120]  Do we get angry with each other?
[39:50.120 --> 39:52.120]  Is society falling apart?
[39:52.120 --> 39:59.120]  Yes, does it make it tough on everybody? Police, citizens, firefighters, school teachers?
[39:59.120 --> 40:03.120]  It's tough on all of us, we're all in this together against a few thousand globalists
[40:03.120 --> 40:07.120]  To control the world's currency issuance and liquidity
[40:07.120 --> 40:13.120]  And they are building a very, very bad world, a selfish world only for them
[40:13.120 --> 40:16.120]  And it's time to break the chains, the mental chains
[40:19.120 --> 40:25.120]  Now, briefly, and then I'm going to go to Raphael, Lindsay, Sherry, Clayton and others
[40:27.120 --> 40:29.120]  What is continuity of government?
[40:29.120 --> 40:37.120]  It is modern, scientifically packaged and crafted and tested
[40:39.120 --> 40:41.120]  Martial law
[40:41.120 --> 40:47.120]  But it's more than just total federalization, complete takeover of local communities
[40:49.120 --> 40:53.120]  It is a takeover of the tyrannical government itself
[40:53.120 --> 41:00.120]  It is a further centralizing from the states to the feds, from the feds to Homeland Security
[41:00.120 --> 41:09.120]  From Homeland Security to private international contracting bodies and the president
[41:09.120 --> 41:15.120]  It is the complete and total domination and takeover of the United States
[41:15.120 --> 41:24.120]  And it's been done in every other major nation
[41:24.120 --> 41:28.120]  The shadow government dominated and took over Japan and never relinquished control
[41:28.120 --> 41:32.120]  The shadow government took over South Korea and never relinquished control
[41:32.120 --> 41:38.120]  The shadow global government took control of Germany and Europe and never relinquished control
[41:38.120 --> 41:41.120]  The shadow government has taken control of the United States
[41:41.120 --> 41:48.120]  And is expanding that control and removing the last checks and balances to open dictatorship
[41:48.120 --> 41:54.120]  Of the elite, of the oligarchs
[41:54.120 --> 42:00.120]  And then you study who runs Northcom, you study who runs the defense contractors
[42:00.120 --> 42:05.120]  You study who controls the council on foreign relations
[42:05.120 --> 42:17.120]  And it is made up of European, British, Israeli and US banks and financial institutions
[42:17.120 --> 42:22.120]  Who are now in control of this nation
[42:22.120 --> 42:32.120]  And at the highest levels they are openly putting in British officers, Israeli officers, Dutch officers, German officers
[42:32.120 --> 42:37.120]  At the highest levels of the continuity of government system
[42:37.120 --> 42:48.120]  And handing over authority to private contractors which are fully and wholly owned subsidiaries of foreign governments and corporations
[42:48.120 --> 42:53.120]  You see, once you get federal control, then you can take control of the federal government
[42:53.120 --> 42:56.120]  That's why the new order loves centralization
[42:56.120 --> 43:01.120]  That's why they'll work with a communist dictator, a fascist dictator, a racial dictator
[43:01.120 --> 43:05.120]  They'll work with anyone who centralizes
[43:05.120 --> 43:12.120]  Because once they've centralized, they can focus their intelligence arms, private, corporate government
[43:12.120 --> 43:20.120]  Into those already centralized systems and gain full control
[43:20.120 --> 43:22.120]  And that has now happened
[43:22.120 --> 43:26.120]  We have to come to grips with the fact that our nation is completely dominated
[43:26.120 --> 43:35.120]  By what China was 150 years ago through the turn of the 20th century
[43:35.120 --> 43:48.120]  We are subdivided, we are controlled, we are being sold off on the auction block globally right now
[43:48.120 --> 43:54.120]  The NSA spies on whoever they want, whenever they want for economic gain and espionage on the people
[43:54.120 --> 43:59.120]  They spy on the mayors, the governors, the legislatures, the congress, the parliaments
[43:59.120 --> 44:01.120]  This has all been admitted
[44:01.120 --> 44:09.120]  They have hit teams to murder anyone in high positions of power that tries to expose them
[44:09.120 --> 44:15.120]  And the global ruling elite are social engineers and have believed in eugenics for 140 plus years
[44:15.120 --> 44:18.120]  And are carrying out in mass against us now
[44:18.120 --> 44:29.120]  They are murdering us, they are killing us, and no one else that I know of understands the paradigm to the level that we on this show do
[44:29.120 --> 44:35.120]  And that is the one reason they have not killed us
[44:35.120 --> 44:41.120]  Is because they don't want to underline and highlight an exclamation point, everything we're saying
[44:41.120 --> 44:49.120]  We don't want our words glowing like brightest neon in the dead of this tyrannical darkness
[44:49.120 --> 44:55.120]  Does that mean they won't try to implant me with cancer or run me over or kill me or set me up if they can?
[44:55.120 --> 44:57.120]  Undoubtedly
[44:57.120 --> 45:03.120]  Do I barricade doors as a security precaution when I'm out of my home? Absolutely
[45:03.120 --> 45:05.120]  Do I do that out of fear?
[45:05.120 --> 45:12.120]  Do I do that out of understanding enemy operations?
[45:12.120 --> 45:16.120]  This is very serious waters we're in
[45:16.120 --> 45:21.120]  And I do everything I do out of love of the people
[45:21.120 --> 45:23.120]  And a spirit of self-preservation
[45:23.120 --> 45:26.120]  By preserving the nation and by preserving your liberty
[45:26.120 --> 45:32.120]  I preserve my liberty and my children and families' liberty
[45:32.120 --> 45:39.120]  The only line is what matters, my tribe, my people, and we are all connected to each other
[45:39.120 --> 45:47.120]  I understand that life is transitory for the individual, but it is eternal in the species
[45:47.120 --> 45:57.120]  It has a potential to be, and that is, as sure as life, as sure as death, that we have the potential to people, the stars
[45:57.120 --> 46:13.120]  We have the potential to metamorphosize into wonderful things if we do not allow the destructive technocrats that are destroying the original creation to build their own monstrous system in their image
[46:13.120 --> 46:20.120]  We need to become more wise, we need to study our technologies and let them grow more slowly and be more cautious
[46:20.120 --> 46:24.120]  And not let our species be overtaken and destroyed
[46:24.120 --> 46:29.120]  It is the greatest danger we face, the elite are criminally insane
[46:29.120 --> 46:35.120]  They are highly intelligent, but they are criminally insane and have dwelt too long in the darkness
[46:35.120 --> 46:41.120]  Let's go to your phone calls. Rafael in New York, you're on the air
[46:41.120 --> 46:43.120]  Yes, how are you doing Alex?
[46:43.120 --> 46:44.120]  Good
[46:44.120 --> 46:50.120]  I just want to tell you I'm a great fan, I want to thank you and Jason for opening my eyes
[46:50.120 --> 47:02.120]  I was blind just like everyone else, until I saw loose change, I just want to thank you for opening my eyes, it was an eye-opening experience
[47:02.120 --> 47:05.120]  Well thank you, is there anything on your mind?
[47:05.120 --> 47:13.120]  Yes, I just want to talk briefly about the NIST, their propaganda proposal they just had this morning
[47:13.120 --> 47:24.120]  There's a lot of questions in the proposal, obviously they say the buildings went down again because of the fires, which is ridiculous
[47:24.120 --> 47:30.120]  One of your info wars reporters was caught off, I don't know if you know about this
[47:30.120 --> 47:32.120]  No, what happened?
[47:32.120 --> 47:47.120]  One of your info wars reporter was asking a question about how can you say there was no demolition or explosives in the building if there was no metal to investigate
[47:47.120 --> 47:49.120]  There was no metal actually to investigate
[47:49.120 --> 47:51.120]  Why did they cover up the crime scene?
[47:51.120 --> 47:58.120]  Right, so your reporter was asking a very valid question and of course he got caught off
[47:58.120 --> 48:03.120]  How did he get caught off? Did they cut the feed or did somebody cut his mic off?
[48:03.120 --> 48:13.120]  Someone cut his mic off and it was very, I mean they cut him off totally, it was very unprofessional
[48:13.120 --> 48:29.120]  Of course the professor, I think his name was Sudar, obviously gave a false answer, it was a terrible answer to the question and it's just unbelievable how we keep getting cut off for asking valid questions
[48:29.120 --> 48:36.120]  Well I didn't watch this, was the person physically there or was it part of the web conference they were taking calls or questions from the internet?
[48:36.120 --> 48:46.120]  The reporter was physically there, they were also taking web questions but he was physically there, he physically asked the question and they cut his question, he was the only reporter to get his question cut off
[48:46.120 --> 48:54.120]  Of course, now they said they were with info wars?
[48:54.120 --> 49:01.120]  Yes, well that's what he said, I forget his name but he did say I am a reporter for infowars.com
[49:01.120 --> 49:11.120]  Probably Luke Rodowski or somebody, we need to whoever that was have them call into the show, if it's one of our people they'll have a hotline number call in
[49:11.120 --> 49:25.120]  Let me guess, what did, by the way those on NIST are all top thermite explosives experts, there's only maybe 20 of them in the world or less and it just so happens they're all working at NIST, very interesting
[49:25.120 --> 49:31.120]  And involved in the reports as well and involved in government black ops projects, no big deal
[49:31.120 --> 49:38.120]  Now let me guess, I bet he claimed falsely that all the evidence was studied, the steel wasn't hauled away, did he say something like that?
[49:38.120 --> 49:56.120]  Yeah, also he said he was open that they were open to all possibilities but later on he contradicted himself by saying they didn't even see a reason to investigate thermite in the buildings because it was impossible
[49:56.120 --> 49:58.120]  Oh yes, impossible
[49:58.120 --> 50:07.120]  Which is crazy, I have all the multiple samples with it and video of gouts of it pouring out burning seconds before it collapses as they ignite
[50:07.120 --> 50:09.120]  Yes, unbelievable
[50:09.120 --> 50:16.120]  And you have the police saying get back, we're blowing it up with a countdown, we're not saying the police were involved, they were just told everybody back, it's coming down
[50:16.120 --> 50:18.120]  Yes, I know
[50:18.120 --> 50:26.120]  And BBC caught announcing how it fell, exactly how it fell before and then now admitting that Reuters put that out internally that it had already collapsed with a false start
[50:26.120 --> 50:32.120]  Just like they reported that Lee Harvey Oswald, before he'd been captured or his name was in the news, well they got the time zones off, that happens
[50:32.120 --> 50:42.120]  You know these black op guys make mistakes, they're not perfect, they reported in New Zealand, Australian and other papers that Lee Harvey Oswald shot Kennedy and this is a fact before he was even captured
[50:42.120 --> 50:45.120]  No big deal though, huh?
[50:45.120 --> 51:01.120]  No big deal, the government loves you, they wouldn't hurt you, people that have power and rule the earth aren't evil, they don't want power, they're not cunning, they won't hurt you, they're good, they've never lied to you
[51:01.120 --> 51:08.120]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country
[51:08.120 --> 51:12.120]  The enemy struck America on September 11th, but who is the enemy?
[51:12.120 --> 51:14.120]  Bin Laden, this is his MO
[51:14.120 --> 51:17.120]  We have to look to the Middle East, we have to look to Osama Bin Laden
[51:17.120 --> 51:24.120]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States
[51:24.120 --> 51:31.120]  Some US investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the US
[51:31.120 --> 51:35.120]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained

[53:02.120 --> 53:03.120]  What's up Bonnie
[53:03.120 --> 53:07.120]  Well I got a question about those shielded secure sleeves from Identity Stronghold
[53:07.120 --> 53:12.120]  Yeah, the sleeves that block us from stealing account numbers from the new credit cards with RFID chips
[53:12.120 --> 53:13.120]  What about them?
[53:13.120 --> 53:17.120]  Well I mentioned them to our friends and they went in for purchasing the secure sleeves
[53:17.120 --> 53:24.120]  Oh Bonnie, if everyone starts hearing about the secure sleeve, it will destroy our plan to steal credit card numbers at the mall with my new RFID reader
[53:24.120 --> 53:28.120]  I know, but these are our friends Clyde, they promised not to tell anyone else
[53:28.120 --> 53:31.120]  I guess you're right, that's what friends are for I suppose
[53:31.120 --> 53:36.120]  Tell them they can get a 5 pack of secure sleeves that will fit credit cards and driver's licenses for 1995
[53:36.120 --> 53:42.120]  And Identity Stronghold also has a 3 pack of secure sleeves for passport books for 1495

[55:44.120 --> 55:47.120]  Let's go ahead and talk to Lindsay in Idaho
[55:47.120 --> 55:49.120]  Lindsay you're on the air
[55:49.120 --> 55:50.120]  Good day Alex, how are you?
[55:50.120 --> 55:51.120]  Good sir
[55:51.120 --> 55:54.120]  I like your caller that mentioned
[55:54.120 --> 55:56.120]  about doing things with the chalk
[55:56.120 --> 55:57.120]  Yes sir
[55:57.120 --> 55:58.120]  And you said that was interesting
[55:58.120 --> 56:00.120]  You know something different
[56:00.120 --> 56:03.120]  Here's one for you and this came about
[56:03.120 --> 56:05.120]  There was a viewer not too long ago
[56:05.120 --> 56:07.120]  that was found out your site was censored
[56:07.120 --> 56:09.120]  like in London or something of that nature
[56:09.120 --> 56:11.120]  on the computer, on the internet
[56:11.120 --> 56:14.120]  And I wondered, I wonder if I go to
[56:14.120 --> 56:16.120]  my little library here in town
[56:16.120 --> 56:20.120]  They have about 8 terminals and punch in infowars
[56:20.120 --> 56:22.120]  if it would come up or if it would be filtered
[56:22.120 --> 56:23.120]  if you will
[56:23.120 --> 56:25.120]  I went down there, punched it up
[56:25.120 --> 56:28.120]  Nope, it came on the screen and it dawned on me
[56:28.120 --> 56:30.120]  I left it on the screen and I went to
[56:30.120 --> 56:32.120]  there's about three other ones that were open
[56:32.120 --> 56:35.120]  and punched up your site and just left it on the screen
[56:35.120 --> 56:38.120]  for other people that would sit down next
[56:38.120 --> 56:39.120]  That's the first thing they'd see now
[56:39.120 --> 56:41.120]  whether they look at it or not
[56:41.120 --> 56:43.120]  made no difference, but there it was
[56:43.120 --> 56:44.120]  another way of spreading things
[56:44.120 --> 56:45.120]  Good job
[56:45.120 --> 56:46.120]  What do you think of that, Alex?
[56:46.120 --> 56:48.120]  It's awesome, I've done that myself
[56:48.120 --> 56:51.120]  I've been at the Mac Store picking up one of our home computers
[56:51.120 --> 56:53.120]  They say it's ready and you go pick it up
[56:53.120 --> 56:55.120]  and it's not ready or there's some huge line
[56:55.120 --> 56:57.120]  and I'll just go around like 20 terminals
[56:57.120 --> 57:00.120]  also with the local Patriot stations
[57:00.120 --> 57:02.120]  like 90.1
[57:02.120 --> 57:04.120]  and the times I've been, say, in a circuit city
[57:04.120 --> 57:06.120]  or a Best Buy
[57:06.120 --> 57:09.120]  I would just obnoxiously turn all the radios on to it
[57:09.120 --> 57:12.120]  or if I'm in a rent car, I'll put it on to that
[57:12.120 --> 57:15.120]  I mean, absolutely, I've done similar things
[57:15.120 --> 57:16.120]  Well, that's like I'm saying
[57:16.120 --> 57:19.120]  if you just think of the millions of libraries
[57:19.120 --> 57:22.120]  with the millions of public terminals available
[57:22.120 --> 57:24.120]  if people just went, left it on
[57:24.120 --> 57:26.120]  and again, whether somebody wants to come on
[57:26.120 --> 57:28.120]  and look at it, all of a sudden they see it
[57:28.120 --> 57:30.120]  or ignore it and go on to some other
[57:30.120 --> 57:32.120]  mindless news, that's their business
[57:32.120 --> 57:34.120]  but there it is and it's an interesting way
[57:34.120 --> 57:36.120]  of kind of spreading the site
[57:36.120 --> 57:38.120]  Absolutely, or just printing out little cards
[57:38.120 --> 57:40.120]  even little paper cards
[57:40.120 --> 57:42.120]  I've done a little bit more than that
[57:42.120 --> 57:44.120]  I went and printed out a bunch of
[57:44.120 --> 57:47.120]  on my printer
[57:47.120 --> 57:50.120]  www.infowars.com
[57:50.120 --> 57:53.120]  you go down the road, all the time you see little
[57:53.120 --> 57:56.120]  survey stakes with garage sale signs
[57:56.120 --> 57:58.120]  or whatever, people see these
[57:58.120 --> 58:00.120]  and so randomly, I'll just
[58:00.120 --> 58:02.120]  tack these on there and just put them up and down the road
[58:02.120 --> 58:03.120]  here and there
[58:03.120 --> 58:04.120]  That's awesome, yeah
[58:04.120 --> 58:06.120]  and you can also, just for the newspaper
[58:06.120 --> 58:09.120]  the free newspapers are out when you walk into a restaurant
[58:09.120 --> 58:12.120]  it doesn't even have to be fancy hard cards
[58:12.120 --> 58:14.120]  you can do like, I don't know, 10, 15, however many
[58:14.120 --> 58:16.120]  normal cards go on the face
[58:16.120 --> 58:17.120]  of a normal piece of paper
[58:17.120 --> 58:19.120]  you just cut those up, Lindsay paper
[58:19.120 --> 58:21.120]  probably cost you about half a cent
[58:21.120 --> 58:24.120]  per card or less, I don't know how much a whole sheet of paper is
[58:24.120 --> 58:26.120]  and then you just drop those around
[58:26.120 --> 58:28.120]  with whatever website or radio show
[58:28.120 --> 58:30.120]  or information you want and if everybody starts
[58:30.120 --> 58:31.120]  doing things like that
[58:31.120 --> 58:33.120]  the new order will come down, if not
[58:33.120 --> 58:35.120]  and we're in deep trouble
[58:35.120 --> 58:37.120]  I appreciate your call, Lindsay, keep it up
[58:37.120 --> 58:40.120]  Sherry, Clayton and others, stay with us

[58:53.120 --> 58:55.120]  along with hundreds of my fellow troops
[58:55.120 --> 58:58.120]  I went to ground Sierra and we knew what to do
[58:58.120 --> 59:00.120]  or at least we thought we did
[59:00.120 --> 59:03.120]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film
[59:03.120 --> 59:05.120]  that finally gives first responders a platform
[59:05.120 --> 59:07.120]  to tell their story
[59:07.120 --> 59:12.120]  Whitman, EPA director on the AT
[59:12.120 --> 59:16.120]  made a statement that the air was safe to breathe
[59:16.120 --> 59:19.120]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth
[59:19.120 --> 59:21.120]  as brave souls throughout the world
[59:21.120 --> 59:23.120]  take action against their global masters
[59:23.120 --> 59:25.120]  He had his hand over the radio
[59:25.120 --> 59:27.120]  while he was getting a countdown
[59:27.120 --> 59:29.120]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1
[59:29.120 --> 59:32.120]  and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
[59:32.120 --> 59:35.120]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide

[1:00:12.120 --> 1:00:14.120]  Well, so does he
[1:00:14.120 --> 1:00:18.120]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network
[1:00:18.120 --> 1:00:21.120]  and now, live from Austin, Texas
[1:00:21.120 --> 1:00:26.120]  Alex Jones
[1:00:26.120 --> 1:00:29.120]  Jason Burmes just popped in
[1:00:29.120 --> 1:00:30.120]  to the studio
[1:00:30.120 --> 1:00:32.120]  He heard the caller
[1:00:32.120 --> 1:00:34.120]  Raphael in New York
[1:00:34.120 --> 1:00:36.120]  who was watching live on TV
[1:00:36.120 --> 1:00:37.120]  on the internet feed
[1:00:37.120 --> 1:00:39.120]  They missed how the towers collapsed
[1:00:39.120 --> 1:00:41.120]  Fairy Tale number 10
[1:00:41.120 --> 1:00:45.120]  They've had scores of different disinformation
[1:00:45.120 --> 1:00:49.120]  They've changed their story on no six times now
[1:00:49.120 --> 1:00:51.120]  This is the sixth news story
[1:00:51.120 --> 1:00:54.120]  and then there's been scores of subplots
[1:00:54.120 --> 1:00:56.120]  They were explaining how the towers fell
[1:00:56.120 --> 1:00:58.120]  and how the Easter Bunny and the Leprechauns
[1:00:58.120 --> 1:01:00.120]  and the Kibler Elves were in their chewing
[1:01:00.120 --> 1:01:02.120]  with termites on the metal
[1:01:02.120 --> 1:01:05.120]  And a fellow popped by the office
[1:01:05.120 --> 1:01:08.120]  and we said, yes, you can say you're with infowars
[1:01:08.120 --> 1:01:10.120]  as a freelance reporter
[1:01:10.120 --> 1:01:12.120]  and then NIST called here
[1:01:12.120 --> 1:01:13.120]  Burmes just informed me
[1:01:13.120 --> 1:01:15.120]  he said, God, Tray, was there answering the phone
[1:01:15.120 --> 1:01:16.120]  our skeleton crew
[1:01:16.120 --> 1:01:18.120]  and said, yes, that guy is our reporter
[1:01:18.120 --> 1:01:20.120]  and so he got into the NIST report
[1:01:20.120 --> 1:01:22.120]  and asked the question, did a great job
[1:01:22.120 --> 1:01:25.120]  now we need that fellow to call into the show
[1:01:25.120 --> 1:01:29.120]  so that is just fabulous
[1:01:29.120 --> 1:01:33.120]  Don't forget, we had Anthony Yasha
[1:01:33.120 --> 1:01:35.120]  who's even worked at Genesis
[1:01:35.120 --> 1:01:37.120]  with a desk
[1:01:37.120 --> 1:01:38.120]  he lives at Minneapolis, St. Paul
[1:01:38.120 --> 1:01:39.120]  that's where Genesis is
[1:01:39.120 --> 1:01:42.120]  and Burnsville suburb
[1:01:42.120 --> 1:01:44.120]  and Ted doesn't have press passes
[1:01:44.120 --> 1:01:45.120]  and he said, can I have one?
[1:01:45.120 --> 1:01:48.120]  and they said, yeah, just make one
[1:01:48.120 --> 1:01:51.120]  and then Anthony reports for us
[1:01:51.120 --> 1:01:53.120]  his footage is in Truth Rising
[1:01:53.120 --> 1:01:54.120]  and he said, can I have a press pass?
[1:01:54.120 --> 1:01:55.120]  said, yeah, just make one
[1:01:55.120 --> 1:01:57.120]  we need to make a standard one ourselves
[1:01:57.120 --> 1:02:00.120]  he's just giving orders to armies that don't exist
[1:02:00.120 --> 1:02:03.120]  and Secret Service bullied us
[1:02:03.120 --> 1:02:07.120]  and had two meetings with Ted and demanded
[1:02:07.120 --> 1:02:09.120]  that he say that Anthony was a liar
[1:02:09.120 --> 1:02:10.120]  and never worked for us
[1:02:10.120 --> 1:02:12.120]  or didn't have authorization, never press pass
[1:02:12.120 --> 1:02:14.120]  and they want to charge him with false documents
[1:02:14.120 --> 1:02:16.120]  and some type of espionage
[1:02:16.120 --> 1:02:17.120]  is what they told him
[1:02:17.120 --> 1:02:18.120]  I mean, this is insane
[1:02:18.120 --> 1:02:21.120]  the guy has a desk at Genesis
[1:02:21.120 --> 1:02:23.120]  and it's not enough
[1:02:23.120 --> 1:02:27.120]  I'm already digressing
[1:02:27.120 --> 1:02:29.120]  and I said I'm taking your calls
[1:02:29.120 --> 1:02:32.120]  but good job to the Info Warrior, we salute you
[1:02:32.120 --> 1:02:33.120]  I guess when Aaron gets in
[1:02:33.120 --> 1:02:35.120]  he was up until three in the morning
[1:02:35.120 --> 1:02:37.120]  he'll have the guy's name and info
[1:02:37.120 --> 1:02:42.120]  I couldn't talk to him when he was here
[1:02:42.120 --> 1:02:45.120]  let's go ahead and take another call here
[1:02:45.120 --> 1:02:48.120]  Sherry in Texas, welcome Sherry
[1:02:48.120 --> 1:02:50.120]  hey Alex, how are you doing?
[1:02:50.120 --> 1:02:51.120]  I'm doing pretty good Sherry
[1:02:51.120 --> 1:02:53.120]  really good show today so far
[1:02:53.120 --> 1:02:54.120]  thank you
[1:02:54.120 --> 1:02:55.120]  I was just going to say
[1:02:55.120 --> 1:02:57.120]  yeah, we have to band together
[1:02:57.120 --> 1:02:59.120]  against the New World War
[1:02:59.120 --> 1:03:01.120]  because they like to use
[1:03:01.120 --> 1:03:04.120]  they like to draw the racial lines
[1:03:04.120 --> 1:03:06.120]  they like to use the left-right paradigm
[1:03:06.120 --> 1:03:07.120]  to throw us off track
[1:03:07.120 --> 1:03:09.120]  off the real issues
[1:03:09.120 --> 1:03:13.120]  and it's happening over and over and over again
[1:03:13.120 --> 1:03:15.120]  just in the last few months
[1:03:15.120 --> 1:03:19.120]  also, I've been trying to tell people here
[1:03:19.120 --> 1:03:22.120]  they really are pointing to your kids
[1:03:22.120 --> 1:03:23.120]  they're right
[1:03:23.120 --> 1:03:26.120]  and they're like, well, how do you know that?
[1:03:26.120 --> 1:03:28.120]  and I'm like, okay, let's look at the evidence
[1:03:28.120 --> 1:03:30.120]  they already have iris scanners
[1:03:30.120 --> 1:03:32.120]  at Raleigh High School
[1:03:32.120 --> 1:03:34.120]  right down the road from where you live
[1:03:34.120 --> 1:03:37.120]  they have iris scanners scanning all your kids
[1:03:37.120 --> 1:03:39.120]  little irises
[1:03:39.120 --> 1:03:40.120]  and the government admits
[1:03:40.120 --> 1:03:42.120]  it's training them for the prison society
[1:03:42.120 --> 1:03:45.120]  exactly, you know, it's the, you know
[1:03:45.120 --> 1:03:48.120]  a well-earned untruth of our new prison planet
[1:03:48.120 --> 1:03:50.120]  it really is
[1:03:50.120 --> 1:03:52.120]  and I remember 10, 12 years ago
[1:03:52.120 --> 1:03:54.120]  reading federal documents on air
[1:03:54.120 --> 1:03:55.120]  they were going to put retina scanners
[1:03:55.120 --> 1:03:57.120]  thumb scanners in, cameras
[1:03:57.120 --> 1:03:58.120]  and the parents would laugh
[1:03:58.120 --> 1:04:00.120]  but see, because we warned them
[1:04:00.120 --> 1:04:01.120]  now they're not laughing
[1:04:01.120 --> 1:04:03.120]  yeah, and our ACT scores
[1:04:03.120 --> 1:04:06.120]  last year at TISC were the lowest they've ever been
[1:04:06.120 --> 1:04:08.120]  but they're learning how to be prisoners
[1:04:08.120 --> 1:04:10.120]  exactly, they're learning how to be stupid
[1:04:10.120 --> 1:04:11.120]  dumb-down sheep
[1:04:11.120 --> 1:04:13.120]  and, you know, there's a petition now
[1:04:13.120 --> 1:04:17.120]  to lower the drinking age from 21 to 18
[1:04:17.120 --> 1:04:19.120]  yeah, we don't need that
[1:04:19.120 --> 1:04:21.120]  you know, I had always, I had always
[1:04:21.120 --> 1:04:23.120]  when I was young said, yeah, lower it
[1:04:23.120 --> 1:04:25.120]  now I realize what a horrible driver I was
[1:04:25.120 --> 1:04:26.120]  when I was 16
[1:04:26.120 --> 1:04:29.120]  I realize how lucky I am to be alive
[1:04:29.120 --> 1:04:31.120]  and I never even got that much into alcohol
[1:04:31.120 --> 1:04:32.120]  but, you know, might have gotten drunk
[1:04:32.120 --> 1:04:33.120]  four or five times a year
[1:04:33.120 --> 1:04:34.120]  and that was dangerous
[1:04:34.120 --> 1:04:36.120]  I rode around with drunks
[1:04:36.120 --> 1:04:38.120]  and now that I have children
[1:04:38.120 --> 1:04:40.120]  I'm like, I don't know
[1:04:40.120 --> 1:04:42.120]  a lot of that's just personal responsibility
[1:04:42.120 --> 1:04:44.120]  I just more and more think alcohol
[1:04:44.120 --> 1:04:45.120]  is really a bad thing
[1:04:45.120 --> 1:04:47.120]  but, at the same time, they use it
[1:04:47.120 --> 1:04:49.120]  they'll never get rid of it
[1:04:49.120 --> 1:04:50.120]  they'll just use it for tyranny
[1:04:50.120 --> 1:04:52.120]  so I certainly don't want prohibition
[1:04:52.120 --> 1:04:53.120]  that increases alcoholism
[1:04:53.120 --> 1:04:55.120]  good to hear from you, Sherry
[1:04:55.120 --> 1:04:57.120]  Grey Points, Clayton, Philly

[1:05:04.120 --> 1:05:05.120]  of American history
[1:05:05.120 --> 1:05:08.120]  a terrorist act of war against this country
[1:05:08.120 --> 1:05:11.120]  the enemies struck America on September 11th
[1:05:11.120 --> 1:05:12.120]  but who is the enemy?
[1:05:12.120 --> 1:05:13.120]  bin Laden
[1:05:13.120 --> 1:05:14.120]  this is his MO
[1:05:14.120 --> 1:05:16.120]  we have to look to the Middle East
[1:05:16.120 --> 1:05:18.120]  we have to look to Osama bin Laden
[1:05:18.120 --> 1:05:20.120]  fabled enemies is the first 9-11 film
[1:05:20.120 --> 1:05:21.120]  to take a close look
[1:05:21.120 --> 1:05:23.120]  at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks
[1:05:23.120 --> 1:05:25.120]  inside the United States
[1:05:25.120 --> 1:05:27.120]  some US investigators believe that there are
[1:05:27.120 --> 1:05:29.120]  Israelis, again, very much engaged
[1:05:29.120 --> 1:05:31.120]  in spying in and on the US
[1:05:31.120 --> 1:05:34.120]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens
[1:05:34.120 --> 1:05:35.120]  have been detained
[1:05:35.120 --> 1:05:37.120]  bin Laden's connections to the CIA
[1:05:37.120 --> 1:05:39.120]  the hijackers ties to the FBI
[1:05:39.120 --> 1:05:40.120]  the Saudi Arabian connection
[1:05:40.120 --> 1:05:42.120]  the Israeli intelligence network
[1:05:42.120 --> 1:05:43.120]  warnings and war games

[1:08:21.120 --> 1:08:23.120]  slave training grid
[1:08:23.120 --> 1:08:25.120]  that I'll be in the middle of
[1:08:25.120 --> 1:08:27.120]  trying to expose any provocateur, police or feds
[1:08:27.120 --> 1:08:29.120]  posing as anarchists
[1:08:29.120 --> 1:08:31.120]  or foundation hired anarchists
[1:08:31.120 --> 1:08:34.120]  that are being bev-wacked and protected by the police
[1:08:34.120 --> 1:08:36.120]  we've caught them red-handed being housed by them
[1:08:36.120 --> 1:08:39.120]  and caught them staging violence
[1:08:39.120 --> 1:08:41.120]  and you will be defeated
[1:08:41.120 --> 1:08:43.120]  we may actually stop them this year
[1:08:43.120 --> 1:08:45.120]  there will be a self-fulfilling prophecy
[1:08:45.120 --> 1:08:47.120]  there wasn't any provocateur attacks
[1:08:47.120 --> 1:08:49.120]  you didn't get to, you know, there was no riots
[1:08:49.120 --> 1:08:51.120]  yeah, because we stopped them
[1:08:51.120 --> 1:08:53.120]  we are changed
[1:08:53.120 --> 1:08:55.120]  Denver stopped them, we are changed Colorado
[1:08:55.120 --> 1:08:57.120]  but we'll see what happens, that is in the future
[1:08:57.120 --> 1:08:59.120]  we will, we shall see as they say
[1:08:59.120 --> 1:09:01.120]  let's go ahead
[1:09:01.120 --> 1:09:03.120]  and go to Philly in Denver
[1:09:03.120 --> 1:09:05.120]  Philly, welcome
[1:09:05.120 --> 1:09:07.120]  thank you Alex, how are you doing today? good
[1:09:07.120 --> 1:09:09.120]  I'm a 911 visibility member
[1:09:09.120 --> 1:09:11.120]  as well as we are changed Colorado
[1:09:11.120 --> 1:09:13.120]  and if anyone out there doesn't believe
[1:09:13.120 --> 1:09:15.120]  we are in a police state, you are sadly misguided
[1:09:15.120 --> 1:09:17.120]  man, cops almost every day in Denver
[1:09:17.120 --> 1:09:19.120]  are almost beating people to death for no reason
[1:09:19.120 --> 1:09:21.120]  well, yeah, let me give you
[1:09:21.120 --> 1:09:23.120]  a little reconnaissance that we had going on yesterday
[1:09:23.120 --> 1:09:25.120]  we went down to Nancy Pelosi
[1:09:25.120 --> 1:09:27.120]  her highness had a book signing
[1:09:27.120 --> 1:09:29.120]  and the federal presence
[1:09:29.120 --> 1:09:31.120]  was just unbelievable
[1:09:31.120 --> 1:09:33.120]  also, you know, they had the officers in blue down there
[1:09:33.120 --> 1:09:35.120]  they had about 20 of them
[1:09:35.120 --> 1:09:37.120]  they had about 15 feds with ear buds
[1:09:37.120 --> 1:09:39.120]  you know, shaven heads
[1:09:39.120 --> 1:09:41.120]  then we also had another
[1:09:41.120 --> 1:09:43.120]  some sort of security crew that I couldn't identify
[1:09:43.120 --> 1:09:45.120]  but they were there as well
[1:09:45.120 --> 1:09:47.120]  the room that we were in for the book signing
[1:09:47.120 --> 1:09:49.120]  was completely rimmed
[1:09:49.120 --> 1:09:51.120]  I kid you, not completely rimmed
[1:09:51.120 --> 1:09:53.120]  with security feds and police
[1:09:53.120 --> 1:09:55.120]  they had cops on different levels
[1:09:55.120 --> 1:09:57.120]  of the building
[1:09:57.120 --> 1:09:59.120]  that we were in, it's the tattered cover
[1:09:59.120 --> 1:10:01.120]  they had, we have two levels
[1:10:01.120 --> 1:10:03.120]  well, that's why the government staged the terror attacks
[1:10:03.120 --> 1:10:05.120]  because they have to
[1:10:05.120 --> 1:10:07.120]  have an excuse to act like
[1:10:07.120 --> 1:10:09.120]  it's for terrorism
[1:10:09.120 --> 1:10:11.120]  but really, it's because they're criminals
[1:10:11.120 --> 1:10:13.120]  they know they're getting ready to do things
[1:10:13.120 --> 1:10:15.120]  where people are going to hate them even more
[1:10:15.120 --> 1:10:17.120]  so that's why they staged the terror attacks
[1:10:17.120 --> 1:10:19.120]  well, it was pretty ramped up
[1:10:19.120 --> 1:10:21.120]  I was myself shocked to see
[1:10:21.120 --> 1:10:23.120]  how many security
[1:10:23.120 --> 1:10:25.120]  feds and cops were there
[1:10:25.120 --> 1:10:27.120]  just for this lady, Nancy Pelosi
[1:10:27.120 --> 1:10:29.120]  and then some of our changing members
[1:10:29.120 --> 1:10:31.120]  tried to ask questions and they were just
[1:10:31.120 --> 1:10:33.120]  summarily escorted out to the street
[1:10:33.120 --> 1:10:35.120]  oh, you don't ask questions of a god
[1:10:35.120 --> 1:10:37.120]  oh, no
[1:10:37.120 --> 1:10:39.120]  I mean, they can only have rigged questions
[1:10:39.120 --> 1:10:41.120]  I mean, even cable companies
[1:10:41.120 --> 1:10:43.120]  Comcast was having some public hearing
[1:10:43.120 --> 1:10:45.120]  about restricting
[1:10:45.120 --> 1:10:47.120]  websites you can visit
[1:10:47.120 --> 1:10:49.120]  and basically shutting the web down in their area
[1:10:49.120 --> 1:10:51.120]  and then they paid homeless people
[1:10:51.120 --> 1:10:53.120]  to come sit in the audience
[1:10:53.120 --> 1:10:55.120]  so that citizens couldn't come into the city hall
[1:10:55.120 --> 1:10:57.120]  I mean, this is the type of stuff that's going on now
[1:10:57.120 --> 1:10:59.120]  they're not playing games
[1:10:59.120 --> 1:11:01.120]  they know they're out of control
[1:11:01.120 --> 1:11:03.120]  they know they're going against our will
[1:11:03.120 --> 1:11:05.120]  and they're making a move
[1:11:05.120 --> 1:11:07.120]  they act like they're having a party
[1:11:07.120 --> 1:11:09.120]  it's a good time, it's on our nickel
[1:11:09.120 --> 1:11:11.120]  so they're just having a good time ramping up
[1:11:11.120 --> 1:11:13.120]  this whole police state act
[1:11:13.120 --> 1:11:15.120]  additionally, if you were to come into
[1:11:15.120 --> 1:11:17.120]  to listen to her speak, they went through your backpack
[1:11:17.120 --> 1:11:19.120]  that was, you know
[1:11:19.120 --> 1:11:21.120]  your slave pack
[1:11:21.120 --> 1:11:23.120]  it goes on the back of a slave
[1:11:23.120 --> 1:11:25.120]  I was there with Ellen
[1:11:25.120 --> 1:11:27.120]  they wouldn't allow any of his cameras
[1:11:27.120 --> 1:11:29.120]  in the building
[1:11:29.120 --> 1:11:31.120]  we had some changers in the group
[1:11:31.120 --> 1:11:33.120]  like Rob and Turtle
[1:11:33.120 --> 1:11:35.120]  they had hidden cams
[1:11:35.120 --> 1:11:37.120]  hopefully they got some footage
[1:11:37.120 --> 1:11:39.120]  I don't know if they did or not
[1:11:39.120 --> 1:11:41.120]  look, you got all the big minions
[1:11:41.120 --> 1:11:43.120]  coming in, all the
[1:11:43.120 --> 1:11:45.120]  all the ringwraiths coming into town
[1:11:45.120 --> 1:11:47.120]  they're going to have their little Darth Vader men
[1:11:47.120 --> 1:11:49.120]  scaring around acting like the people are evil
[1:11:49.120 --> 1:11:51.120]  but it's there to suppress free speech
[1:11:51.120 --> 1:11:53.120]  it's not to protect them physically
[1:11:53.120 --> 1:11:55.120]  they know the story, they have no threat
[1:11:55.120 --> 1:11:57.120]  it's all about advertising
[1:11:57.120 --> 1:11:59.120]  don't protest, don't come to events
[1:11:59.120 --> 1:12:01.120]  stay in your house, watch the television
[1:12:01.120 --> 1:12:03.120]  take your flu shot
[1:12:03.120 --> 1:12:05.120]  just die, just die
[1:12:05.120 --> 1:12:07.120]  go home and die, America
[1:12:07.120 --> 1:12:09.120]  and don't let the gods
[1:12:09.120 --> 1:12:11.120]  you can't take their thunder, they got to get up there
[1:12:11.120 --> 1:12:13.120]  and spew pablum
[1:12:13.120 --> 1:12:15.120]  when I was listening to Nancy Pelosi
[1:12:15.120 --> 1:12:17.120]  I thought the top of my head was going to blow off
[1:12:17.120 --> 1:12:19.120]  she has no intellect, I was thumbing through her book
[1:12:19.120 --> 1:12:21.120]  which I did not buy
[1:12:21.120 --> 1:12:23.120]  and it's just garbage
[1:12:23.120 --> 1:12:25.120]  she's just another daughter of a mob boss
[1:12:25.120 --> 1:12:27.120]  it's who they are
[1:12:27.120 --> 1:12:29.120]  she's very charming, she puts on a nice front
[1:12:29.120 --> 1:12:31.120]  but totally bought and paid for by the corporatocracy
[1:12:31.120 --> 1:12:33.120]  and we just
[1:12:33.120 --> 1:12:35.120]  I was joking to
[1:12:35.120 --> 1:12:37.120]  some of the changers saying that
[1:12:37.120 --> 1:12:39.120]  I thought I was at a skinhead convention
[1:12:39.120 --> 1:12:41.120]  with all the shaved heads in the room with the ear buds
[1:12:41.120 --> 1:12:43.120]  and they all just got back from Iraq
[1:12:43.120 --> 1:12:45.120]  and now they've got a new enemy
[1:12:45.120 --> 1:12:47.120]  the American people
[1:12:47.120 --> 1:12:49.120]  well, I look forward to meeting you next week
[1:12:49.120 --> 1:12:51.120]  God bless you, take care
[1:12:51.120 --> 1:12:53.120]  let's go ahead now and go to Elliott in Ohio
[1:12:53.120 --> 1:12:55.120]  then Steve, Matt and others
[1:12:55.120 --> 1:12:57.120]  Elliott, you're on the air
[1:12:57.120 --> 1:12:59.120]  I got a couple tips for people
[1:12:59.120 --> 1:13:01.120]  just how to spread the information
[1:13:01.120 --> 1:13:03.120]  recently
[1:13:03.120 --> 1:13:05.120]  I haven't got on my Facebook or my MySpace
[1:13:05.120 --> 1:13:07.120]  I didn't even create either of them
[1:13:07.120 --> 1:13:09.120]  my friends thought I needed them
[1:13:09.120 --> 1:13:11.120]  but I realized that
[1:13:11.120 --> 1:13:13.120]  it could be used as a tool
[1:13:13.120 --> 1:13:15.120]  I've read how
[1:13:15.120 --> 1:13:17.120]  MySpace is the Trojan horse of the internet
[1:13:17.120 --> 1:13:19.120]  and as is Facebook, I mean StumbleUpon
[1:13:19.120 --> 1:13:21.120]  I Google, they're all the same things
[1:13:21.120 --> 1:13:23.120]  but you can create groups on them
[1:13:23.120 --> 1:13:25.120]  and you can invite people to your group
[1:13:25.120 --> 1:13:27.120]  so what I did was I made a group
[1:13:27.120 --> 1:13:29.120]  9-11 was an inside job
[1:13:29.120 --> 1:13:31.120]  that's like 102 people
[1:13:31.120 --> 1:13:33.120]  so far seven have joined
[1:13:33.120 --> 1:13:35.120]  and I wrote up a little discussion topic
[1:13:35.120 --> 1:13:37.120]  two
[1:13:37.120 --> 1:13:39.120]  two-party system equals one party system
[1:13:39.120 --> 1:13:41.120]  and I got a bunch of quotes
[1:13:41.120 --> 1:13:43.120]  from CFR members Carol Quigley
[1:13:43.120 --> 1:13:45.120]  and David Rockfellage memoirs
[1:13:45.120 --> 1:13:47.120]  just stuff to get the people
[1:13:47.120 --> 1:13:49.120]  you know, stirred
[1:13:49.120 --> 1:13:51.120]  maybe start thinking about some things
[1:13:51.120 --> 1:13:53.120]  and also
[1:13:53.120 --> 1:13:55.120]  the gentleman that you had on
[1:13:55.120 --> 1:13:57.120]  just a little bit ago
[1:13:57.120 --> 1:13:59.120]  where I work, like there is
[1:13:59.120 --> 1:14:01.120]  two computers, I can only use one
[1:14:01.120 --> 1:14:03.120]  I share with the manager
[1:14:03.120 --> 1:14:05.120]  I also just leave info, war.com
[1:14:05.120 --> 1:14:07.120]  some of the articles that I'm reading
[1:14:07.120 --> 1:14:09.120]  I just leave it up there
[1:14:09.120 --> 1:14:11.120]  he thinks it's all, you know, craziness
[1:14:11.120 --> 1:14:13.120]  but I just keep doing it
[1:14:13.120 --> 1:14:15.120]  see what could happen
[1:14:15.120 --> 1:14:17.120]  also there's a local
[1:14:17.120 --> 1:14:19.120]  paper, it's called
[1:14:19.120 --> 1:14:21.120]  Street Bob from Cincinnati
[1:14:21.120 --> 1:14:23.120]  helping out the homeless because they're the vendors
[1:14:23.120 --> 1:14:25.120]  they sell it, they
[1:14:25.120 --> 1:14:27.120]  you buy it for a dollar, they get 75 cents on it
[1:14:27.120 --> 1:14:29.120]  and then 25 cents goes to the
[1:14:29.120 --> 1:14:31.120]  publishing company, but I called up the editor
[1:14:31.120 --> 1:14:33.120]  and he says
[1:14:33.120 --> 1:14:35.120]  I can write for
[1:14:35.120 --> 1:14:37.120]  I mean, I wouldn't get paid any money
[1:14:37.120 --> 1:14:39.120]  but he says, depending on what I write
[1:14:39.120 --> 1:14:41.120]  like as I was saying, would you mind if I talked about
[1:14:41.120 --> 1:14:43.120]  Federal Reserve, the New World Order
[1:14:43.120 --> 1:14:45.120]  the reason why poor people are poor
[1:14:45.120 --> 1:14:47.120]  and he was like, sure, yeah, just send me
[1:14:47.120 --> 1:14:49.120]  just send me some information
[1:14:49.120 --> 1:14:51.120]  papers and even some big ones
[1:14:51.120 --> 1:14:53.120]  that will let you
[1:14:53.120 --> 1:14:55.120]  write alternative information
[1:14:55.120 --> 1:14:57.120]  and
[1:14:57.120 --> 1:14:59.120]  you know, there's some distant people in my family
[1:14:59.120 --> 1:15:01.120]  that live here in Austin who think vaccines
[1:15:01.120 --> 1:15:03.120]  are wonderful when I'm a medical doctor
[1:15:03.120 --> 1:15:05.120]  and they let her write big things in the Austin
[1:15:05.120 --> 1:15:07.120]  America States one about how wonderful it is
[1:15:07.120 --> 1:15:09.120]  but you know, that's a paper that wants to spew propaganda
[1:15:09.120 --> 1:15:11.120]  but vice versa
[1:15:11.120 --> 1:15:13.120]  you know, they'll have community leaders write things, you know, that are against it
[1:15:13.120 --> 1:15:15.120]  so
[1:15:15.120 --> 1:15:17.120]  absolutely, I mean
[1:15:17.120 --> 1:15:19.120]  to the editor, all of this, just any crack
[1:15:19.120 --> 1:15:21.120]  in the enemy's electronic
[1:15:21.120 --> 1:15:23.120]  Berlin Wall
[1:15:23.120 --> 1:15:25.120]  is great and remember, people are listening to us
[1:15:25.120 --> 1:15:27.120]  like they never have before
[1:15:27.120 --> 1:15:29.120]  and Congress has an 11%, 9%
[1:15:29.120 --> 1:15:31.120]  excuse me, it's gone down, 9% approval rating
[1:15:31.120 --> 1:15:33.120]  in the last Gallup poll a few months ago
[1:15:33.120 --> 1:15:35.120]  I mean, let Nancy Pelosi
[1:15:35.120 --> 1:15:37.120]  spew her lies, everybody hates her, nobody likes
[1:15:37.120 --> 1:15:39.120]  her, nobody likes Bush
[1:15:39.120 --> 1:15:41.120]  I mean, you may be able to fill a stadium
[1:15:41.120 --> 1:15:43.120]  with a bunch of Obama bots or McCain bots
[1:15:43.120 --> 1:15:45.120]  but I mean, that's still
[1:15:45.120 --> 1:15:47.120]  a minority of Kool-Aid drinking idiots
[1:15:47.120 --> 1:15:49.120]  that probably don't even know
[1:15:49.120 --> 1:15:51.120]  basically what country they're in
[1:15:51.120 --> 1:15:53.120]  I appreciate your call
[1:15:53.120 --> 1:15:55.120]  let's go ahead and go to
[1:15:55.120 --> 1:15:57.120]  Steve in Denver
[1:15:57.120 --> 1:15:59.120]  Steve, you're on the air
[1:15:59.120 --> 1:16:01.120]  thanks a lot Alex for everything you've been
[1:16:01.120 --> 1:16:03.120]  doing, we really appreciate it, I'm looking forward to
[1:16:03.120 --> 1:16:05.120]  meeting you, shaking your hand, looking you square in the eye
[1:16:05.120 --> 1:16:07.120]  and telling you how much I appreciate
[1:16:07.120 --> 1:16:09.120]  the work you've been doing for everybody
[1:16:09.120 --> 1:16:11.120]  I know it's kind of tough at times but hanging there man
[1:16:11.120 --> 1:16:13.120]  a lot of stuff going on here, you know
[1:16:13.120 --> 1:16:15.120]  sure
[1:16:15.120 --> 1:16:17.120]  you know, I was hoping to see if we could
[1:16:17.120 --> 1:16:19.120]  find a way to motivate some of the people
[1:16:19.120 --> 1:16:21.120]  who are already informed to
[1:16:21.120 --> 1:16:23.120]  apply some collective pressure on
[1:16:23.120 --> 1:16:25.120]  Congress, maybe
[1:16:25.120 --> 1:16:27.120]  try to get as many as 5 million contacts
[1:16:27.120 --> 1:16:29.120]  going in the week of the anniversary of the
[1:16:29.120 --> 1:16:31.120]  7th anniversary of 9-11
[1:16:31.120 --> 1:16:33.120]  demanding a new investigation because you know
[1:16:33.120 --> 1:16:35.120]  Alex, as much as we're doing
[1:16:35.120 --> 1:16:37.120]  so many good things to get visibility
[1:16:37.120 --> 1:16:39.120]  and inform people, you know, I don't really think
[1:16:39.120 --> 1:16:41.120]  we're having any effect on the government inside
[1:16:41.120 --> 1:16:43.120]  the inside Capitol Hill
[1:16:43.120 --> 1:16:45.120]  Are you kidding, they're having to have NIST reports lying
[1:16:45.120 --> 1:16:47.120]  countering us, they're having to
[1:16:47.120 --> 1:16:49.120]  have violent radicalization
[1:16:49.120 --> 1:16:51.120]  acts in Congress, trying to talk about
[1:16:51.120 --> 1:16:53.120]  restricting free speech and how we're taking over
[1:16:53.120 --> 1:16:55.120]  and how dangerous we are and how we're al-Qaeda
[1:16:55.120 --> 1:16:57.120]  I mean, ridiculous stuff that only discredits
[1:16:57.120 --> 1:16:59.120]  them more, we're having a huge
[1:16:59.120 --> 1:17:01.120]  effect sir, believe me
[1:17:01.120 --> 1:17:03.120]  we're having a gigantic effect
[1:17:03.120 --> 1:17:05.120]  Well, is there any way we could post
[1:17:05.120 --> 1:17:07.120]  each one of these people up on a
[1:17:07.120 --> 1:17:09.120]  website, that's what we're looking at doing right now
[1:17:09.120 --> 1:17:11.120]  having some serious answers
[1:17:11.120 --> 1:17:13.120]  questions to them posed as to
[1:17:13.120 --> 1:17:15.120]  are you in support of the Council on Foreign Relations
[1:17:15.120 --> 1:17:17.120]  the Federal Reserve Board
[1:17:17.120 --> 1:17:19.120]  the current wars and the outsourcing
[1:17:19.120 --> 1:17:21.120]  of our economy, you know, there's so many different questions
[1:17:21.120 --> 1:17:23.120]  we could ask, but I want to hold these guys accountable
[1:17:23.120 --> 1:17:25.120]  before the election comes, Alex, because
[1:17:25.120 --> 1:17:27.120]  you know, the reality is I
[1:17:27.120 --> 1:17:29.120]  I don't think anybody is looking
[1:17:29.120 --> 1:17:31.120]  at them personally from the standpoint
[1:17:31.120 --> 1:17:33.120]  of the voters and what they represent
[1:17:33.120 --> 1:17:35.120]  and holding them
[1:17:35.120 --> 1:17:37.120]  No, I hear you, we have a shadow government
[1:17:37.120 --> 1:17:39.120]  that do nothing puppets
[1:17:39.120 --> 1:17:41.120]  that run nothing
[1:17:41.120 --> 1:17:43.120]  now and I appreciate your call, I mean the key
[1:17:43.120 --> 1:17:45.120]  is letting Congress know that we know
[1:17:45.120 --> 1:17:47.120]  they're blackmailed and they're puppets
[1:17:47.120 --> 1:17:49.120]  and the continuity of governments running everything
[1:17:49.120 --> 1:17:51.120]  that's really the key is exposing the shadow government
[1:17:51.120 --> 1:17:53.120]  that stage the terror attacks as a pretext
[1:17:53.120 --> 1:17:55.120]  to activate their shadow government
[1:17:55.120 --> 1:17:57.120]  and absorb what little left
[1:17:57.120 --> 1:17:59.120]  of sovereignty and
[1:17:59.120 --> 1:18:01.120]  accountability and elected officials
[1:18:01.120 --> 1:18:03.120]  that still had any power
[1:18:03.120 --> 1:18:05.120]  I mean, now we're pretty much under the grid
[1:18:05.120 --> 1:18:07.120]  there's just some free speech left and now they're moving
[1:18:07.120 --> 1:18:09.120]  to shut that down
[1:18:09.120 --> 1:18:11.120]  but the enemy is very weak
[1:18:11.120 --> 1:18:13.120]  during this period because now they are revealing
[1:18:13.120 --> 1:18:15.120]  themselves
[1:18:15.120 --> 1:18:17.120]  now on the subject, this is key
[1:18:17.120 --> 1:18:19.120]  on the subject of writing
[1:18:19.120 --> 1:18:21.120]  and calling Congress
[1:18:21.120 --> 1:18:23.120]  generally
[1:18:23.120 --> 1:18:25.120]  when you give them millions of phone calls, they just hire
[1:18:25.120 --> 1:18:27.120]  more SWAT teams and more police and get more scared
[1:18:27.120 --> 1:18:29.120]  because they know we know that they're criminals
[1:18:29.120 --> 1:18:31.120]  when they see a 9% approval rating and everybody
[1:18:31.120 --> 1:18:33.120]  hates them and their lives don't work anymore
[1:18:33.120 --> 1:18:35.120]  they just go build camps, build
[1:18:35.120 --> 1:18:37.120]  yes, yes, okay, I'm going to steal more money
[1:18:37.120 --> 1:18:39.120]  protect me executive branch
[1:18:39.120 --> 1:18:41.120]  I'll be criminal, I've been involved with you
[1:18:41.120 --> 1:18:43.120]  okay, let's go for broke, shut them down
[1:18:43.120 --> 1:18:45.120]  I mean, a lot of members of Congress are like
[1:18:45.120 --> 1:18:47.120]  okay, martial law, fine, just give me power
[1:18:47.120 --> 1:18:49.120]  okay, you know, don't indict me
[1:18:49.120 --> 1:18:51.120]  don't let them get me, don't let grand juries get me
[1:18:51.120 --> 1:18:53.120]  at the states, we need martial law
[1:18:53.120 --> 1:18:55.120]  to protect our criminal activity
[1:18:57.120 --> 1:18:59.120]  see, as long as they don't have total martial law
[1:18:59.120 --> 1:19:01.120]  they're not invincible, they can be punished
[1:19:01.120 --> 1:19:03.120]  by the justice
[1:19:03.120 --> 1:19:05.120]  but once the full corporatocracy is in control
[1:19:05.120 --> 1:19:07.120]  they're a lot safer, they think
[1:19:07.120 --> 1:19:09.120]  once they're tracking you to track all of us
[1:19:09.120 --> 1:19:11.120]  they think they're safe and all these big Denver
[1:19:11.120 --> 1:19:13.120]  events and the rest of it in Minneapolis
[1:19:13.120 --> 1:19:15.120]  are police state training grids to practice
[1:19:15.120 --> 1:19:17.120]  more of this in the future and to get better
[1:19:17.120 --> 1:19:19.120]  at suppressing and controlling and keeping the slaves
[1:19:19.120 --> 1:19:21.120]  away from the demigods
[1:19:21.120 --> 1:19:23.120]  but
[1:19:23.120 --> 1:19:25.120]  but it does work when they're about to pass amnesty
[1:19:25.120 --> 1:19:27.120]  and they keep it secret to let them know
[1:19:27.120 --> 1:19:29.120]  that you're not going to support them in the next election
[1:19:29.120 --> 1:19:31.120]  but
[1:19:31.120 --> 1:19:33.120]  then they race with electronic machines
[1:19:33.120 --> 1:19:35.120]  to put them into place to block you from that
[1:19:35.120 --> 1:19:37.120]  but then it becomes more obvious that
[1:19:37.120 --> 1:19:39.120]  no one likes them, no one supports them
[1:19:39.120 --> 1:19:41.120]  but they keep winning, you see
[1:19:41.120 --> 1:19:43.120]  so now there's that crisis, that's what I had to have
[1:19:43.120 --> 1:19:45.120]  martial law, there's that crisis where we're going
[1:19:45.120 --> 1:19:47.120]  we'll wait, you got 9% approval rating
[1:19:47.120 --> 1:19:49.120]  but you're winning, what's going on
[1:19:49.120 --> 1:19:51.120]  they're like, shut up, we have officers
[1:19:51.120 --> 1:19:53.120]  with weapons
[1:19:53.120 --> 1:19:55.120]  you understand, I mean, that's the system we've reached here
[1:19:55.120 --> 1:19:57.120]  it's that flash point when we finally go
[1:19:57.120 --> 1:19:59.120]  oh my god, it really is martial law
[1:19:59.120 --> 1:20:01.120]  it really is tyranny
[1:20:01.120 --> 1:20:03.120]  it is a big idea
[1:20:03.120 --> 1:20:05.120]  a new world order
[1:20:05.120 --> 1:20:07.120]  in the near future
[1:20:07.120 --> 1:20:09.120]  earth is dominated by a powerful
[1:20:09.120 --> 1:20:11.120]  world government
[1:20:11.120 --> 1:20:13.120]  it's known as the builder bird
[1:20:13.120 --> 1:20:15.120]  couldn't their objective be world domination?
[1:20:15.120 --> 1:20:17.120]  for thousands of years
[1:20:17.120 --> 1:20:19.120]  their dark order grew
[1:20:19.120 --> 1:20:21.120]  now as they hail the birth
[1:20:21.120 --> 1:20:23.120]  of the new world order, their great dream
[1:20:23.120 --> 1:20:25.120]  of exterminating 80%
[1:20:25.120 --> 1:20:27.120]  of humanity is at hand

[1:20:39.120 --> 1:20:41.120]  the builder bird is making great progress
[1:20:41.120 --> 1:20:43.120]  for the world government
[1:20:43.120 --> 1:20:45.120]  most people have no idea, they're not after money
[1:20:45.120 --> 1:20:47.120]  they have all the money they need, they're after power

[1:22:39.120 --> 1:22:41.120]  they have accumulated the power they have
[1:22:41.120 --> 1:22:43.120]  established the poisoning of the masses

[1:24:25.120 --> 1:24:27.120]  thanks for calling
[1:24:27.120 --> 1:24:29.120]  as I mentioned regarding yesterday
[1:24:29.120 --> 1:24:31.120]  when you're talking to good old Paul Watson there
[1:24:31.120 --> 1:24:33.120]  regarding about the state of affairs
[1:24:33.120 --> 1:24:35.120]  we're having in the UK
[1:24:35.120 --> 1:24:37.120]  as mentioned obviously about the
[1:24:37.120 --> 1:24:39.120]  we call them bin police in the UK
[1:24:39.120 --> 1:24:41.120]  but obviously Paul mentioned enforcement
[1:24:41.120 --> 1:24:43.120]  police digging through your trash
[1:24:43.120 --> 1:24:45.120]  tracking you, arresting you
[1:24:45.120 --> 1:24:47.120]  yeah I just thought I was asking
[1:24:47.120 --> 1:24:49.120]  what's it like in the US
[1:24:49.120 --> 1:24:51.120]  do you have those the same type of people
[1:24:51.120 --> 1:24:53.120]  like Gendry and garbage in England
[1:24:53.120 --> 1:24:55.120]  no no they're just now starting it
[1:24:55.120 --> 1:24:57.120]  you're a few years ahead of us with the Enviro police
[1:24:57.120 --> 1:24:59.120]  but yes they're going to create 10 million
[1:24:59.120 --> 1:25:01.120]  manned burgades
[1:25:01.120 --> 1:25:03.120]  tattletale squads
[1:25:03.120 --> 1:25:05.120]  animal ID, premise society
[1:25:05.120 --> 1:25:07.120]  harassment forces just hellish
[1:25:07.120 --> 1:25:09.120]  parasites being turned loose
[1:25:09.120 --> 1:25:11.120]  in my hometown we have like a local event
[1:25:11.120 --> 1:25:13.120]  like a beach festival, it's like a free
[1:25:13.120 --> 1:25:15.120]  like a pop event where I've like unsigned bands
[1:25:15.120 --> 1:25:17.120]  that come to my hometown
[1:25:17.120 --> 1:25:19.120]  and it's just amazing how
[1:25:19.120 --> 1:25:21.120]  the editorial even my hometown's been now
[1:25:21.120 --> 1:25:23.120]  because every year you could be able
[1:25:23.120 --> 1:25:25.120]  to take beer and lager
[1:25:25.120 --> 1:25:27.120]  or whatever we call it in the UK
[1:25:27.120 --> 1:25:29.120]  down to the main beach and listen to the free music
[1:25:29.120 --> 1:25:31.120]  and they've even stopped that now
[1:25:31.120 --> 1:25:33.120]  they've even put enforcement, they've had that much security
[1:25:33.120 --> 1:25:35.120]  at my hometown
[1:25:35.120 --> 1:25:37.120]  that's just become absolutely
[1:25:37.120 --> 1:25:39.120]  horrendous
[1:25:39.120 --> 1:25:41.120]  it's all slave training
[1:25:41.120 --> 1:25:43.120]  it's all, I mean seeing adults
[1:25:43.120 --> 1:25:45.120]  being bossed around like their children
[1:25:45.120 --> 1:25:47.120]  it's letting you know
[1:25:47.120 --> 1:25:49.120]  you have no dignity, you're a slave
[1:25:49.120 --> 1:25:51.120]  yep and also
[1:25:51.120 --> 1:25:53.120]  I've written daily mail today actually
[1:25:53.120 --> 1:25:55.120]  that in UK schools
[1:25:55.120 --> 1:25:57.120]  and even in my son's primary school
[1:25:57.120 --> 1:25:59.120]  in the UK they've even got CCTV cameras
[1:25:59.120 --> 1:26:01.120]  and actual playground and I can't believe
[1:26:01.120 --> 1:26:03.120]  they're even going to put them in the classrooms
[1:26:03.120 --> 1:26:05.120]  in the toilets, I mean this is absolutely
[1:26:05.120 --> 1:26:07.120]  and this will all be used against them
[1:26:07.120 --> 1:26:09.120]  for petty stuff to throw the book at them
[1:26:09.120 --> 1:26:11.120]  and get them into the system, I appreciate your call
[1:26:11.120 --> 1:26:13.120]  let's talk to Ramey in Oklahoma
[1:26:13.120 --> 1:26:15.120]  Ramey, welcome
[1:26:15.120 --> 1:26:17.120]  Hi Ramey
[1:26:17.120 --> 1:26:19.120]  Hey Alex, I was just calling
[1:26:19.120 --> 1:26:21.120]  I'm a nurse in Oklahoma City
[1:26:21.120 --> 1:26:23.120]  in one of the big hospitals
[1:26:23.120 --> 1:26:25.120]  and what they're doing
[1:26:25.120 --> 1:26:27.120]  there with their vaccines
[1:26:27.120 --> 1:26:29.120]  is almost like forced inoculation
[1:26:29.120 --> 1:26:31.120]  you go in
[1:26:31.120 --> 1:26:33.120]  you're admitted
[1:26:33.120 --> 1:26:35.120]  they have on your schedule
[1:26:35.120 --> 1:26:37.120]  pneumovax and flu vaccine
[1:26:37.120 --> 1:26:39.120]  and these poor people don't know
[1:26:39.120 --> 1:26:41.120]  you go in, you say
[1:26:41.120 --> 1:26:43.120]  okay you need this shot, here you go
[1:26:43.120 --> 1:26:45.120]  they're like okay, you know
[1:26:45.120 --> 1:26:47.120]  they're using the trust and authority of the medical system
[1:26:47.120 --> 1:26:49.120]  and then a lot of places
[1:26:49.120 --> 1:26:51.120]  are trying to refuse care if adults
[1:26:51.120 --> 1:26:53.120]  haven't had vaccines
[1:26:53.120 --> 1:26:55.120]  because there's trillions of dollars in the drug companies
[1:26:55.120 --> 1:26:57.120]  absolutely
[1:26:57.120 --> 1:26:59.120]  they are lobbying the medical associations
[1:26:59.120 --> 1:27:01.120]  the medical companies
[1:27:01.120 --> 1:27:03.120]  paying them bounties to do this
[1:27:03.120 --> 1:27:05.120]  and the news is announcing it's the law
[1:27:05.120 --> 1:27:07.120]  children have to have them, there's no law
[1:27:07.120 --> 1:27:09.120]  again, it's just like Russia didn't attack Georgia
[1:27:09.120 --> 1:27:11.120]  it's just all giant hoaxes
[1:27:11.120 --> 1:27:13.120]  and lies, that's why we're in so much trouble folks
[1:27:13.120 --> 1:27:15.120]  and then they tried to order
[1:27:15.120 --> 1:27:17.120]  all the police, firemen and medical workers
[1:27:17.120 --> 1:27:19.120]  remember five years ago to take smallpox
[1:27:19.120 --> 1:27:21.120]  they ordered 14 million first responders
[1:27:21.120 --> 1:27:23.120]  and they all said basically no
[1:27:23.120 --> 1:27:25.120]  so
[1:27:25.120 --> 1:27:27.120]  the 4000 that did take it, a bunch died
[1:27:27.120 --> 1:27:29.120]  so see, they're just bringing this
[1:27:29.120 --> 1:27:31.120]  tearing again
[1:27:31.120 --> 1:27:33.120]  yep, it was the vaccines that woke me up
[1:27:33.120 --> 1:27:35.120]  because I was pregnant with the
[1:27:35.120 --> 1:27:37.120]  son
[1:27:37.120 --> 1:27:39.120]  and after you do so much research and you realize
[1:27:39.120 --> 1:27:41.120]  hey, the government must know about this
[1:27:41.120 --> 1:27:43.120]  you know, then you kind of put two and two together
[1:27:43.120 --> 1:27:45.120]  and realize, yeah they do know
[1:27:45.120 --> 1:27:47.120]  they just don't want to do anything about it
[1:27:47.120 --> 1:27:49.120]  because it's being done on purpose
[1:27:49.120 --> 1:27:51.120]  and then you find actual documents from the
[1:27:51.120 --> 1:27:53.120]  20s and 30s where they developed
[1:27:53.120 --> 1:27:55.120]  the cancer viruses
[1:27:55.120 --> 1:27:57.120]  they found out most cancer was communicable
[1:27:57.120 --> 1:27:59.120]  we'll put it in the shots, then we'll own the hospitals
[1:27:59.120 --> 1:28:01.120]  we'll own the cancer systems
[1:28:01.120 --> 1:28:03.120]  the doctors and people below will never know
[1:28:03.120 --> 1:28:05.120]  it's all compartmentalized
[1:28:05.120 --> 1:28:07.120]  and now there's all these plagues upon us
[1:28:07.120 --> 1:28:09.120]  and it's almost all of it
[1:28:09.120 --> 1:28:11.120]  is from the vaccines and GMO food
[1:28:11.120 --> 1:28:13.120]  and now they're saying, oh the ignorant Africans
[1:28:13.120 --> 1:28:15.120]  they won't, this is BBC
[1:28:15.120 --> 1:28:17.120]  and other publications, they won't take the shots anymore
[1:28:17.120 --> 1:28:19.120]  they run into the woods
[1:28:19.120 --> 1:28:21.120]  and they go, oh we've engineered potatoes and rice
[1:28:21.120 --> 1:28:23.120]  that have the vaccines in them
[1:28:23.120 --> 1:28:25.120]  we'll feed it to them
[1:28:25.120 --> 1:28:27.120]  we're going to do that to us
[1:28:27.120 --> 1:28:29.120]  this is just incredibly dastardly
[1:28:29.120 --> 1:28:31.120]  people are just really brainwashed
[1:28:31.120 --> 1:28:33.120]  especially the people I work with at the hospital
[1:28:33.120 --> 1:28:35.120]  you try to talk to them
[1:28:35.120 --> 1:28:37.120]  about stuff and they just
[1:28:37.120 --> 1:28:39.120]  they act like you're crazy
[1:28:39.120 --> 1:28:41.120]  well that's because they're a good person
[1:28:41.120 --> 1:28:43.120]  and so they can't imagine
[1:28:43.120 --> 1:28:45.120]  that they're doing anything wrong
[1:28:45.120 --> 1:28:47.120]  at your hospital, whenever they check a woman in
[1:28:47.120 --> 1:28:49.120]  do they sit there and ask her
[1:28:49.120 --> 1:28:51.120]  oh is everything okay at home, you got a good family environment
[1:28:51.120 --> 1:28:53.120]  while they type it into the health department database
[1:28:53.120 --> 1:28:55.120]  or does the nurse typing
[1:28:55.120 --> 1:28:57.120]  I didn't even know that's going into database
[1:28:57.120 --> 1:28:59.120]  yes we know and especially
[1:28:59.120 --> 1:29:01.120]  like the old people that come in
[1:29:01.120 --> 1:29:03.120]  you have to check if you suspect abuse
[1:29:03.120 --> 1:29:05.120]  or even if they're not old just anybody
[1:29:05.120 --> 1:29:07.120]  do you suspect abuse
[1:29:07.120 --> 1:29:09.120]  and then that automatically goes
[1:29:09.120 --> 1:29:11.120]  to their database
[1:29:11.120 --> 1:29:13.120]  to investigate
[1:29:13.120 --> 1:29:15.120]  I'm going with my wife to have children
[1:29:15.120 --> 1:29:17.120]  and I go there because I know the doctor
[1:29:17.120 --> 1:29:19.120]  she's a patriot but the rest of them
[1:29:19.120 --> 1:29:21.120]  and they go, oh please take this file downstairs
[1:29:21.120 --> 1:29:23.120]  and I go, oh sure, I'm weak at my wife
[1:29:23.120 --> 1:29:25.120]  and then it's, is he hurting you
[1:29:25.120 --> 1:29:27.120]  because again, they don't even let
[1:29:27.120 --> 1:29:29.120]  the woman know because we want to snatch your baby
[1:29:29.120 --> 1:29:31.120]  hun and then a woman you know
[1:29:31.120 --> 1:29:33.120]  they might have had a fight two weeks before it's over
[1:29:33.120 --> 1:29:35.120]  the child will be with the pedophile
[1:29:35.120 --> 1:29:37.120]  rape gangs that day
[1:29:37.120 --> 1:29:39.120]  that's how America operates
[1:29:39.120 --> 1:29:41.120]  the evil is just totally ingrained everywhere
[1:29:41.120 --> 1:29:43.120]  you know, stay there, I've got a mini
[1:29:43.120 --> 1:29:45.120]  guest coming up but I want to come back to you about
[1:29:45.120 --> 1:29:51.120]  this database from others that don't know
[1:29:51.120 --> 1:29:53.120]  we're on the march
[1:29:53.120 --> 1:29:55.120]  the empire's on the run
[1:29:55.120 --> 1:30:01.120]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[1:30:01.120 --> 1:30:03.120]  a day unlike any other
[1:30:03.120 --> 1:30:05.120]  in the long course of American history
[1:30:05.120 --> 1:30:08.120]  a terrorist act of war against this country
[1:30:08.120 --> 1:30:11.120]  the enemy struck America on September 11th
[1:30:11.120 --> 1:30:13.120]  but who is the enemy?
[1:30:13.120 --> 1:30:15.120]  this is his MO
[1:30:15.120 --> 1:30:17.120]  we have to look to the Middle East
[1:30:17.120 --> 1:30:19.120]  we have to look to Osama bin Laden
[1:30:19.120 --> 1:30:21.120]  fabled enemies is the first 9-11 film
[1:30:21.120 --> 1:30:23.120]  to take a close look at the terrorist ties
[1:30:23.120 --> 1:30:25.120]  to intelligence networks inside the United States
[1:30:25.120 --> 1:30:27.120]  some US investigators believe that
[1:30:27.120 --> 1:30:29.120]  there are Israelis again very much engaged
[1:30:29.120 --> 1:30:31.120]  in spying in and on the US
[1:30:31.120 --> 1:30:33.120]  I'm aware that some Israeli
[1:30:33.120 --> 1:30:35.120]  citizens have been detained
[1:30:35.120 --> 1:30:37.120]  in Laden's connections to the CIA
[1:30:37.120 --> 1:30:39.120]  the hijackers ties to the FBI

[1:34:09.120 --> 1:34:11.120]  well I appreciate that Alex
[1:34:11.120 --> 1:34:13.120]  you're one of the good guys
[1:34:13.120 --> 1:34:15.120]  and
[1:34:15.120 --> 1:34:17.120]  sometimes
[1:34:17.120 --> 1:34:19.120]  sometimes the condolences
[1:34:19.120 --> 1:34:21.120]  hurt more than
[1:34:21.120 --> 1:34:23.120]  the thing that we're dealing with
[1:34:23.120 --> 1:34:25.120]  oh I'm sorry well these folks have been wondering
[1:34:25.120 --> 1:34:27.120]  where you are so that's why we bring it up
[1:34:27.120 --> 1:34:29.120]  but you're back now
[1:34:29.120 --> 1:34:31.120]  yep getting off
[1:34:31.120 --> 1:34:33.120]  that subject I know it's a tough one for you
[1:34:33.120 --> 1:34:35.120]  Steve
[1:34:35.120 --> 1:34:37.120]  what's happened to you Ronald this over a month ago
[1:34:37.120 --> 1:34:39.120]  I know
[1:34:39.120 --> 1:34:41.120]  things things have
[1:34:41.120 --> 1:34:43.120]  gone really goofy one of the things that's
[1:34:43.120 --> 1:34:45.120]  happened in the
[1:34:45.120 --> 1:34:47.120]  media is that
[1:34:47.120 --> 1:34:49.120]  we've had some softening of the concern
[1:34:49.120 --> 1:34:51.120]  for the food situation by
[1:34:51.120 --> 1:34:53.120]  pointing out the fact that we're going to have a bumper
[1:34:53.120 --> 1:34:55.120]  crop and that the impact
[1:34:55.120 --> 1:34:57.120]  of the flooding in the Midwest was not
[1:34:57.120 --> 1:34:59.120]  as severe as what they thought and all this
[1:34:59.120 --> 1:35:01.120]  let me point
[1:35:01.120 --> 1:35:03.120]  something out and
[1:35:03.120 --> 1:35:05.120]  those of you that I know
[1:35:05.120 --> 1:35:07.120]  that a lot of you that are listeners
[1:35:07.120 --> 1:35:09.120]  here take notes from
[1:35:09.120 --> 1:35:11.120]  time to time you might want to take notes on this
[1:35:11.120 --> 1:35:13.120]  remember
[1:35:13.120 --> 1:35:15.120]  remember this
[1:35:15.120 --> 1:35:17.120]  all of the issues with
[1:35:17.120 --> 1:35:19.120]  regard to the cost of
[1:35:19.120 --> 1:35:21.120]  food are related
[1:35:21.120 --> 1:35:23.120]  to investors investing
[1:35:23.120 --> 1:35:25.120]  in your sustenance
[1:35:25.120 --> 1:35:27.120]  and making huge
[1:35:27.120 --> 1:35:29.120]  profits from it
[1:35:29.120 --> 1:35:31.120]  let's just go down very very quickly
[1:35:31.120 --> 1:35:33.120]  I don't want to take a lot of time on this but just
[1:35:33.120 --> 1:35:35.120]  just for the sake of you listeners that
[1:35:35.120 --> 1:35:37.120]  haven't put the dots together here
[1:35:37.120 --> 1:35:39.120]  oil prices
[1:35:39.120 --> 1:35:41.120]  based on the fact that
[1:35:41.120 --> 1:35:43.120]  investors are investing
[1:35:43.120 --> 1:35:45.120]  in the oil before it gets to you
[1:35:45.120 --> 1:35:47.120]  and that's what keeps the prices up
[1:35:47.120 --> 1:35:49.120]  ethanol the mandate
[1:35:49.120 --> 1:35:51.120]  by the US Congress
[1:35:51.120 --> 1:35:53.120]  to take our food and turn it into fuel
[1:35:53.120 --> 1:35:55.120]  as inefficient as it is
[1:35:55.120 --> 1:35:57.120]  is based on investors
[1:35:57.120 --> 1:35:59.120]  making huge profits on doing that
[1:35:59.120 --> 1:36:01.120]  subsidies to farms
[1:36:01.120 --> 1:36:03.120]  now a lot of the farmers
[1:36:03.120 --> 1:36:05.120]  are being you know I read articles
[1:36:05.120 --> 1:36:07.120]  all the time Alex about the fact that
[1:36:07.120 --> 1:36:09.120]  that the farmers
[1:36:09.120 --> 1:36:11.120]  are making a windfall profit
[1:36:11.120 --> 1:36:13.120]  that is pure garbage
[1:36:13.120 --> 1:36:15.120]  the farmers are going out of business
[1:36:15.120 --> 1:36:17.120]  as a result of these
[1:36:17.120 --> 1:36:19.120]  subsidies that are being paid to large
[1:36:19.120 --> 1:36:21.120]  agricorps and just land
[1:36:21.120 --> 1:36:23.120]  investors like Ted Turner and some of those guys
[1:36:23.120 --> 1:36:25.120]  have thousands of acres
[1:36:25.120 --> 1:36:27.120]  that are being paid subsidies not to grow on
[1:36:27.120 --> 1:36:29.120]  what they wouldn't grow on anyway
[1:36:29.120 --> 1:36:31.120]  and that is boosting
[1:36:31.120 --> 1:36:33.120]  food costs investors
[1:36:33.120 --> 1:36:35.120]  are investing now in water
[1:36:35.120 --> 1:36:37.120]  worldwide
[1:36:37.120 --> 1:36:39.120]  and particularly in the United States
[1:36:39.120 --> 1:36:41.120]  they're buying up water rights land over
[1:36:41.120 --> 1:36:43.120]  aquifers that
[1:36:43.120 --> 1:36:45.120]  in the in the state of a
[1:36:45.120 --> 1:36:47.120]  worldwide three-year worldwide
[1:36:47.120 --> 1:36:49.120]  famine well that's what T. Boone's Pickens
[1:36:49.120 --> 1:36:51.120]  is doing I mean they're snatching up
[1:36:51.120 --> 1:36:53.120]  everything real
[1:36:53.120 --> 1:36:55.120]  everything they can get their hands on that's connected
[1:36:55.120 --> 1:36:57.120]  with food you see
[1:36:57.120 --> 1:36:59.120]  in any marketing situation Alex
[1:36:59.120 --> 1:37:01.120]  you've got to sit and you've got a
[1:37:01.120 --> 1:37:03.120]  circumstance where investors
[1:37:03.120 --> 1:37:05.120]  look at needs
[1:37:05.120 --> 1:37:07.120]  and the greatest need
[1:37:07.120 --> 1:37:09.120]  provides the greatest opportunity to invest
[1:37:09.120 --> 1:37:11.120]  food
[1:37:11.120 --> 1:37:13.120]  is the greatest basic need that we've got
[1:37:13.120 --> 1:37:15.120]  as human beings on this planet
[1:37:15.120 --> 1:37:17.120]  and in a situation
[1:37:17.120 --> 1:37:19.120]  where we're in the third year of a worldwide
[1:37:19.120 --> 1:37:21.120]  famine the two most
[1:37:21.120 --> 1:37:23.120]  populated countries in the world
[1:37:23.120 --> 1:37:25.120]  India and China
[1:37:25.120 --> 1:37:27.120]  just broke off relations
[1:37:27.120 --> 1:37:29.120]  with the United States with regard to
[1:37:29.120 --> 1:37:31.120]  the negotiations over food
[1:37:31.120 --> 1:37:33.120]  embargoes and
[1:37:33.120 --> 1:37:35.120]  and all of the restrictions
[1:37:35.120 --> 1:37:37.120]  on importing
[1:37:37.120 --> 1:37:39.120]  exporting of foods because
[1:37:39.120 --> 1:37:41.120]  the United States was trying to use our food
[1:37:41.120 --> 1:37:43.120]  to control those
[1:37:43.120 --> 1:37:45.120]  countries as much as they could
[1:37:45.120 --> 1:37:47.120]  and it's not going to work
[1:37:47.120 --> 1:37:49.120]  but the fact is that
[1:37:49.120 --> 1:37:51.120]  water
[1:37:51.120 --> 1:37:53.120]  in a famine environment is
[1:37:53.120 --> 1:37:55.120]  more precious than gold and all of these
[1:37:55.120 --> 1:37:57.120]  investors are investing like crazy
[1:37:57.120 --> 1:37:59.120]  Mr. Bush Mr.
[1:37:59.120 --> 1:38:01.120]  Reverend Moon and
[1:38:01.120 --> 1:38:03.120]  you mentioned Pickens
[1:38:03.120 --> 1:38:05.120]  and Buffett all of these
[1:38:05.120 --> 1:38:07.120]  huge huge money people
[1:38:07.120 --> 1:38:09.120]  are going after water more
[1:38:09.120 --> 1:38:11.120]  intently than they ever ever
[1:38:11.120 --> 1:38:13.120]  went. He just brought up Colorado
[1:38:13.120 --> 1:38:15.120]  Texas and Mexico most of the water
[1:38:15.120 --> 1:38:17.120]  just a complete scam
[1:38:17.120 --> 1:38:19.120]  well what we did on our
[1:38:19.120 --> 1:38:21.120]  radio program a couple times and
[1:38:21.120 --> 1:38:23.120]  on the internet
[1:38:23.120 --> 1:38:25.120]  is we tried to put out the message to
[1:38:25.120 --> 1:38:27.120]  farmers or ex-farmers or people
[1:38:27.120 --> 1:38:29.120]  that own land in the west where
[1:38:29.120 --> 1:38:31.120]  it requires irrigation and people have
[1:38:31.120 --> 1:38:33.120]  water rights please do not
[1:38:33.120 --> 1:38:35.120]  sell to these
[1:38:35.120 --> 1:38:37.120]  investors sell to your neighbors
[1:38:37.120 --> 1:38:39.120]  the farmers that are trying to keep things going
[1:38:39.120 --> 1:38:41.120]  your water rights
[1:38:41.120 --> 1:38:43.120]  the problem is
[1:38:43.120 --> 1:38:45.120]  is that the
[1:38:45.120 --> 1:38:47.120]  water issue is just absolutely
[1:38:47.120 --> 1:38:49.120]  horrendous in the time of famine the last
[1:38:49.120 --> 1:38:51.120]  thing is of course my pet peeve
[1:38:51.120 --> 1:38:53.120]  commodities investors
[1:38:53.120 --> 1:38:55.120]  you know Alex as well as I do
[1:38:55.120 --> 1:38:57.120]  that the farmers are not
[1:38:57.120 --> 1:38:59.120]  making the money investors are going in
[1:38:59.120 --> 1:39:01.120]  and buying the food
[1:39:01.120 --> 1:39:03.120]  holding it and selling it to foreign nations
[1:39:03.120 --> 1:39:05.120]  for cheap American dollars
[1:39:05.120 --> 1:39:07.120]  but you see
[1:39:07.120 --> 1:39:09.120]  no matter what the reason
[1:39:09.120 --> 1:39:11.120]  is that those prices are going up
[1:39:11.120 --> 1:39:13.120]  and you see it doesn't well they just reported
[1:39:13.120 --> 1:39:15.120]  they just reported that inflation
[1:39:15.120 --> 1:39:17.120]  is double what the fed quote
[1:39:17.120 --> 1:39:19.120]  thought it would be with even their cook numbers
[1:39:19.120 --> 1:39:21.120]  it's really about 14-15% but Steve
[1:39:21.120 --> 1:39:23.120]  you're always saying it's horrible food
[1:39:23.120 --> 1:39:25.120]  because of
[1:39:25.120 --> 1:39:27.120]  prices going up dollar devaluation
[1:39:27.120 --> 1:39:29.120]  I just say have it
[1:39:29.120 --> 1:39:31.120]  as an insurance policy that
[1:39:31.120 --> 1:39:33.120]  lasts more than 10 years
[1:39:33.120 --> 1:39:35.120]  because regardless the world is getting more
[1:39:35.120 --> 1:39:37.120]  dangerous not safer
[1:39:37.120 --> 1:39:39.120]  and with the crazy stuff
[1:39:39.120 --> 1:39:41.120]  with Russia and Georgia
[1:39:41.120 --> 1:39:43.120]  and Iran and elections and terrorism
[1:39:43.120 --> 1:39:45.120]  and criminal government
[1:39:45.120 --> 1:39:47.120]  I mean people are crazy
[1:39:47.120 --> 1:39:49.120]  if they don't get horrible food
[1:39:49.120 --> 1:39:51.120]  they don't have a choice at this point Alex
[1:39:51.120 --> 1:39:53.120]  it's just absolutely
[1:39:53.120 --> 1:39:55.120]  is no choice
[1:39:55.120 --> 1:39:57.120]  what's happening right now
[1:39:57.120 --> 1:39:59.120]  it doesn't make any difference if we had
[1:39:59.120 --> 1:40:01.120]  the greatest bumper crop
[1:40:01.120 --> 1:40:03.120]  the world has ever seen in every country
[1:40:03.120 --> 1:40:05.120]  right now that is starving
[1:40:05.120 --> 1:40:07.120]  if all of a sudden it turned around and by October
[1:40:07.120 --> 1:40:09.120]  a miracle
[1:40:09.120 --> 1:40:11.120]  happened and we had a huge bumper crop
[1:40:11.120 --> 1:40:13.120]  it would not make one bit of difference
[1:40:13.120 --> 1:40:15.120]  to the families in America
[1:40:15.120 --> 1:40:17.120]  that right now can't afford food
[1:40:17.120 --> 1:40:19.120]  and it wouldn't make any difference to the families
[1:40:19.120 --> 1:40:21.120]  that tomorrow will not be able
[1:40:21.120 --> 1:40:23.120]  to afford food because those prices are going to keep going up
[1:40:23.120 --> 1:40:25.120]  because these
[1:40:25.120 --> 1:40:27.120]  investors are not going to
[1:40:27.120 --> 1:40:29.120]  stop investing and that
[1:40:29.120 --> 1:40:31.120]  will tie up any excess that they have
[1:40:31.120 --> 1:40:33.120]  it will go into
[1:40:33.120 --> 1:40:35.120]  corn ethanol and all of this kind of stuff
[1:40:35.120 --> 1:40:37.120]  so the cast
[1:40:37.120 --> 1:40:39.120]  is set but really very simply
[1:40:39.120 --> 1:40:41.120]  you know as well as I do
[1:40:41.120 --> 1:40:43.120]  Alex that before
[1:40:43.120 --> 1:40:45.120]  up until about six months ago
[1:40:45.120 --> 1:40:47.120]  we were talking always about preparing
[1:40:47.120 --> 1:40:49.120]  for the future having it
[1:40:49.120 --> 1:40:51.120]  two, three, four years ahead
[1:40:51.120 --> 1:40:53.120]  for when things got really goofy
[1:40:53.120 --> 1:40:55.120]  well things are really goofy and now
[1:40:55.120 --> 1:40:57.120]  what we're talking about
[1:40:57.120 --> 1:40:59.120]  is telling people
[1:40:59.120 --> 1:41:01.120]  the average housewife
[1:41:01.120 --> 1:41:03.120]  right now that barely can afford
[1:41:03.120 --> 1:41:05.120]  working full time to help her husband
[1:41:05.120 --> 1:41:07.120]  earn enough money to pay for the
[1:41:07.120 --> 1:41:09.120]  gas and the food
[1:41:09.120 --> 1:41:11.120]  is in a situation where she
[1:41:11.120 --> 1:41:13.120]  literally
[1:41:13.120 --> 1:41:15.120]  if they will get involved with this low moisture
[1:41:15.120 --> 1:41:17.120]  high nutrition bulk food
[1:41:17.120 --> 1:41:19.120]  and start using it
[1:41:19.120 --> 1:41:21.120]  they literally can buy
[1:41:21.120 --> 1:41:23.120]  their food for this year at half
[1:41:23.120 --> 1:41:25.120]  the cost of last year's food
[1:41:25.120 --> 1:41:27.120]  and you're saying even
[1:41:27.120 --> 1:41:29.120]  you're saying even get freeze dried food now
[1:41:29.120 --> 1:41:31.120]  and eat it because it's so
[1:41:31.120 --> 1:41:33.120]  inexpensive compared to what's in the store
[1:41:33.120 --> 1:41:35.120]  that then you can save money
[1:41:35.120 --> 1:41:37.120]  it's half the cost of last year's groceries Alex
[1:41:37.120 --> 1:41:39.120]  half the cost
[1:41:39.120 --> 1:41:41.120]  of last year's groceries
[1:41:41.120 --> 1:41:43.120]  and the main thing that people
[1:41:43.120 --> 1:41:45.120]  can do by doing that we've got
[1:41:45.120 --> 1:41:47.120]  I get emails all the time
[1:41:47.120 --> 1:41:49.120]  about families that right now
[1:41:49.120 --> 1:41:51.120]  can't afford the groceries and they say
[1:41:51.120 --> 1:41:53.120]  we believe what Alex is saying
[1:41:53.120 --> 1:41:55.120]  we believe what you're saying
[1:41:55.120 --> 1:41:57.120]  but what do we do
[1:41:57.120 --> 1:41:59.120]  we can't afford food now let alone put it ahead
[1:41:59.120 --> 1:42:01.120]  if they will get involved in using this
[1:42:01.120 --> 1:42:03.120]  they can
[1:42:03.120 --> 1:42:05.120]  save enough to actually
[1:42:05.120 --> 1:42:07.120]  provide for their family right now
[1:42:07.120 --> 1:42:09.120]  and also buy some ahead
[1:42:09.120 --> 1:42:11.120]  while it's still available
[1:42:11.120 --> 1:42:13.120]  Steve let me ask you a question
[1:42:13.120 --> 1:42:15.120]  do you have any stories about Costco
[1:42:15.120 --> 1:42:17.120]  only letting you buy one thing or rice or Walmart
[1:42:17.120 --> 1:42:19.120]  are they really running out of rice
[1:42:21.120 --> 1:42:23.120]  well very simply
[1:42:23.120 --> 1:42:25.120]  that rationing is the result
[1:42:25.120 --> 1:42:27.120]  of the food that is being
[1:42:27.120 --> 1:42:29.120]  shipped out of the country
[1:42:29.120 --> 1:42:31.120]  you see just because our farmers
[1:42:31.120 --> 1:42:33.120]  are growing rice doesn't mean
[1:42:33.120 --> 1:42:35.120]  that it stays here
[1:42:35.120 --> 1:42:37.120]  it used to be illegal for anybody
[1:42:37.120 --> 1:42:39.120]  to not illegal
[1:42:39.120 --> 1:42:41.120]  but it wasn't allowed
[1:42:41.120 --> 1:42:43.120]  for people that
[1:42:43.120 --> 1:42:45.120]  didn't have a use for the rice
[1:42:45.120 --> 1:42:47.120]  to buy up huge quantities of it
[1:42:47.120 --> 1:42:49.120]  it had to be a milling company
[1:42:49.120 --> 1:42:51.120]  or a food processing company
[1:42:51.120 --> 1:42:53.120]  that could actually take delivery
[1:42:53.120 --> 1:42:55.120]  they've opened that up so anybody can buy it
[1:42:55.120 --> 1:42:57.120]  and then they buy it and then brag about the fact
[1:42:57.120 --> 1:42:59.120]  that they're going to wait until it doubles in price
[1:42:59.120 --> 1:43:01.120]  in the world market and then sell it
[1:43:01.120 --> 1:43:03.120]  to whoever the highest bidder is
[1:43:03.120 --> 1:43:05.120]  that takes it right out of the country
[1:43:05.120 --> 1:43:07.120]  and so we have no reserve anymore
[1:43:07.120 --> 1:43:09.120]  Alex we have no reserve
[1:43:09.120 --> 1:43:11.120]  that's the basis
[1:43:11.120 --> 1:43:13.120]  our poor people eat top ramen
[1:43:13.120 --> 1:43:15.120]  and noodles and spaghetti
[1:43:15.120 --> 1:43:17.120]  and things like that
[1:43:17.120 --> 1:43:19.120]  that's made from wheat flour
[1:43:19.120 --> 1:43:21.120]  when they ration wheat flour
[1:43:21.120 --> 1:43:23.120]  rice worldwide
[1:43:23.120 --> 1:43:25.120]  is short by 70%
[1:43:25.120 --> 1:43:27.120]  here's an example
[1:43:27.120 --> 1:43:29.120]  a couple months ago I went to
[1:43:29.120 --> 1:43:31.120]  Monja Pizza
[1:43:31.120 --> 1:43:33.120]  and it said our prices
[1:43:33.120 --> 1:43:35.120]  have gone up 25% or something on the wall
[1:43:35.120 --> 1:43:37.120]  was a sign
[1:43:37.120 --> 1:43:39.120]  that our flour cost has
[1:43:39.120 --> 1:43:41.120]  doubled
[1:43:41.120 --> 1:43:43.120]  and now I've seen similar signs in other restaurants
[1:43:43.120 --> 1:43:45.120]  so it's really happening
[1:43:45.120 --> 1:43:47.120]  do you know that the coating on Kentucky fried chicken
[1:43:47.120 --> 1:43:49.120]  the
[1:43:49.120 --> 1:43:51.120]  seasoned flour base that they put on it
[1:43:51.120 --> 1:43:53.120]  is four times
[1:43:53.120 --> 1:43:55.120]  what it was last year at this time
[1:43:55.120 --> 1:43:57.120]  I went into
[1:43:57.120 --> 1:43:59.120]  a Kentucky fried chicken and all of a sudden
[1:43:59.120 --> 1:44:01.120]  to get one of these big buckets is $42
[1:44:01.120 --> 1:44:03.120]  $42
[1:44:03.120 --> 1:44:05.120]  and I said what happened
[1:44:05.120 --> 1:44:07.120]  you know it used to be
[1:44:07.120 --> 1:44:09.120]  in the teens they said hey
[1:44:09.120 --> 1:44:11.120]  the cost of the seasoned flour
[1:44:11.120 --> 1:44:13.120]  that we get from our warehouse
[1:44:13.120 --> 1:44:15.120]  and Kentucky fried chicken has gone up
[1:44:15.120 --> 1:44:17.120]  400%
[1:44:17.120 --> 1:44:19.120]  it's just
[1:44:19.120 --> 1:44:21.120]  and it's constantly going up
[1:44:21.120 --> 1:44:23.120]  now we've had a little bit of a break
[1:44:23.120 --> 1:44:25.120]  in terms of the
[1:44:25.120 --> 1:44:27.120]  the fuel situation
[1:44:27.120 --> 1:44:29.120]  a lot of states
[1:44:29.120 --> 1:44:31.120]  of the cost of fuel
[1:44:31.120 --> 1:44:33.120]  of gasoline
[1:44:33.120 --> 1:44:35.120]  is going down just a little bit
[1:44:35.120 --> 1:44:37.120]  this will not happen
[1:44:37.120 --> 1:44:39.120]  cannot happen
[1:44:39.120 --> 1:44:41.120]  and will not happen in the future
[1:44:41.120 --> 1:44:43.120]  with regard to food
[1:44:43.120 --> 1:44:45.120]  because of all of this investment
[1:44:45.120 --> 1:44:47.120]  Alex it's very simple
[1:44:47.120 --> 1:44:49.120]  all of the investors are making huge
[1:44:49.120 --> 1:44:51.120]  windfall profits
[1:44:51.120 --> 1:44:53.120]  at the same time the farmers
[1:44:53.120 --> 1:44:55.120]  that are raising the meat now
[1:44:55.120 --> 1:44:57.120]  the U.S. Department of Agriculture just came out with a statement
[1:44:57.120 --> 1:44:59.120]  that
[1:44:59.120 --> 1:45:01.120]  meat and poultry
[1:45:01.120 --> 1:45:03.120]  are going to be very very cost
[1:45:03.120 --> 1:45:05.120]  well
[1:45:05.120 --> 1:45:07.120]  they're going to be their cost
[1:45:07.120 --> 1:45:09.120]  is going to go up tremendously
[1:45:09.120 --> 1:45:11.120]  within this next year
[1:45:11.120 --> 1:45:13.120]  and the reason for that
[1:45:13.120 --> 1:45:15.120]  is our producers
[1:45:15.120 --> 1:45:17.120]  can't afford to buy
[1:45:17.120 --> 1:45:19.120]  the corn to feed the cattle
[1:45:19.120 --> 1:45:21.120]  can't afford to buy the feed
[1:45:21.120 --> 1:45:23.120]  because
[1:45:23.120 --> 1:45:25.120]  those producers are not being subsidized
[1:45:25.120 --> 1:45:27.120]  and then meanwhile I've been listening to Derry Brownfield
[1:45:27.120 --> 1:45:29.120]  who's an expert on this used to run the cattleman's association
[1:45:29.120 --> 1:45:31.120]  run a major stockyard in Kansas City
[1:45:31.120 --> 1:45:33.120]  yep
[1:45:33.120 --> 1:45:35.120]  they have you know him well
[1:45:35.120 --> 1:45:37.120]  they have taken over the beef association
[1:45:37.120 --> 1:45:39.120]  ten years ago everything's run by the big agribusiness
[1:45:39.120 --> 1:45:41.120]  they're waging a war right now
[1:45:41.120 --> 1:45:43.120]  to drive down cattle prices
[1:45:43.120 --> 1:45:45.120]  while they're actually going to get record prices
[1:45:45.120 --> 1:45:47.120]  when it actually gets to the store
[1:45:47.120 --> 1:45:49.120]  so it's a huge consolidation happening
[1:45:49.120 --> 1:45:51.120]  oh absolutely
[1:45:51.120 --> 1:45:53.120]  the farmers that are producing
[1:45:53.120 --> 1:45:55.120]  our food are just being
[1:45:55.120 --> 1:45:57.120]  squeezed out of the picture completely
[1:45:57.120 --> 1:45:59.120]  and so the only hope
[1:45:59.120 --> 1:46:01.120]  that a family has
[1:46:01.120 --> 1:46:03.120]  you know
[1:46:03.120 --> 1:46:05.120]  we talk about they
[1:46:05.120 --> 1:46:07.120]  a lot of families think well they won't let this happen
[1:46:07.120 --> 1:46:09.120]  they won't they will fix it
[1:46:09.120 --> 1:46:11.120]  they will have to do something
[1:46:11.120 --> 1:46:13.120]  why on earth would anybody
[1:46:13.120 --> 1:46:15.120]  with half a brain
[1:46:15.120 --> 1:46:17.120]  think that they
[1:46:17.120 --> 1:46:19.120]  will fix a problem
[1:46:19.120 --> 1:46:21.120]  that they intentionally created that's profitable to them
[1:46:21.120 --> 1:46:23.120]  it ain't gonna happen
[1:46:23.120 --> 1:46:25.120]  Alex it ain't gonna happen
[1:46:25.120 --> 1:46:27.120]  so what has to happen
[1:46:27.120 --> 1:46:29.120]  is that
[1:46:29.120 --> 1:46:31.120]  the people like you
[1:46:31.120 --> 1:46:33.120]  and like me
[1:46:33.120 --> 1:46:35.120]  and the other families out there
[1:46:35.120 --> 1:46:37.120]  are going to have to take control
[1:46:37.120 --> 1:46:39.120]  of their
[1:46:39.120 --> 1:46:41.120]  their life situation
[1:46:41.120 --> 1:46:43.120]  food is life
[1:46:43.120 --> 1:46:45.120]  and so any of you
[1:46:45.120 --> 1:46:47.120]  that are in a situation
[1:46:47.120 --> 1:46:49.120]  where you can still afford to set aside
[1:46:49.120 --> 1:46:51.120]  a little bit or have some assets
[1:46:51.120 --> 1:46:53.120]  that aren't being totally eaten up just by
[1:46:53.120 --> 1:46:55.120]  your very existence
[1:46:55.120 --> 1:46:57.120]  please
[1:46:57.120 --> 1:46:59.120]  whether you work with JMS
[1:46:59.120 --> 1:47:01.120]  or E-Foods Direct or whether you work with somebody else
[1:47:01.120 --> 1:47:03.120]  I don't care
[1:47:03.120 --> 1:47:05.120]  you've got to get food in
[1:47:05.120 --> 1:47:07.120]  the best food to get in
[1:47:07.120 --> 1:47:09.120]  is not freeze-dried
[1:47:09.120 --> 1:47:11.120]  is not canned
[1:47:11.120 --> 1:47:13.120]  the best food is
[1:47:13.120 --> 1:47:15.120]  low moisture
[1:47:15.120 --> 1:47:17.120]  high nutrition bulk foods
[1:47:17.120 --> 1:47:19.120]  that you can buy at half the cost
[1:47:19.120 --> 1:47:21.120]  of last year's groceries
[1:47:21.120 --> 1:47:23.120]  and you start living on that right now
[1:47:23.120 --> 1:47:25.120]  and then
[1:47:25.120 --> 1:47:27.120]  in addition to that you buy as much ahead
[1:47:27.120 --> 1:47:29.120]  as fast as you can because
[1:47:29.120 --> 1:47:31.120]  every single family in this country
[1:47:31.120 --> 1:47:33.120]  at some point in the very near future
[1:47:33.120 --> 1:47:35.120]  will get to the point where they can only afford
[1:47:35.120 --> 1:47:37.120]  their bare groceries
[1:47:37.120 --> 1:47:39.120]  and then after that many families
[1:47:39.120 --> 1:47:41.120]  already are in a situation
[1:47:41.120 --> 1:47:43.120]  where they can afford to buy food right now
[1:47:43.120 --> 1:47:45.120]  I get emails all the time
[1:47:45.120 --> 1:47:47.120]  I hope things
[1:47:47.120 --> 1:47:49.120]  aren't this bad but regardless
[1:47:49.120 --> 1:47:51.120]  you really should get prepared
[1:47:51.120 --> 1:47:53.120]  and take control of their lives
[1:47:53.120 --> 1:47:55.120]  not let the criminal government have control of their lives
[1:47:55.120 --> 1:47:57.120]  now you've got a free brochure
[1:47:57.120 --> 1:47:59.120]  we've also got a free audio CD
[1:47:59.120 --> 1:48:01.120]  people are calling it but they shouldn't wait
[1:48:01.120 --> 1:48:03.120]  I like those little two month supply boogie packs
[1:48:03.120 --> 1:48:05.120]  I've got some of those at the office
[1:48:05.120 --> 1:48:07.120]  then as you know I bought
[1:48:07.120 --> 1:48:09.120]  what is it four one year supplies from you
[1:48:09.120 --> 1:48:11.120]  but then I get part of it to family
[1:48:11.120 --> 1:48:13.120]  and I frankly should have more
[1:48:13.120 --> 1:48:15.120]  but the bottom line here is this lasts more than 10 years
[1:48:15.120 --> 1:48:17.120]  in climate control
[1:48:17.120 --> 1:48:19.120]  it is what's the right word
[1:48:19.120 --> 1:48:21.120]  dehydrated
[1:48:21.120 --> 1:48:23.120]  and it's just really high quality food
[1:48:23.120 --> 1:48:25.120]  you're the longest continually operating company
[1:48:25.120 --> 1:48:27.120]  in the nation and you're also a sponsor
[1:48:27.120 --> 1:48:29.120]  and make this show possible
[1:48:29.120 --> 1:48:31.120]  so we just appreciate you
[1:48:31.120 --> 1:48:33.120]  Steve give folks the phone number
[1:48:33.120 --> 1:48:35.120]  give them the website
[1:48:35.120 --> 1:48:37.120]  okay it's
[1:48:37.120 --> 1:48:39.120]  800-409-5633
[1:48:39.120 --> 1:48:41.120]  800-409-5633
[1:48:41.120 --> 1:48:43.120]  and some sweet little
[1:48:43.120 --> 1:48:45.120]  Arkansas gals will answer that telephone
[1:48:45.120 --> 1:48:47.120]  and
[1:48:47.120 --> 1:48:49.120]  get you hooked up to get
[1:48:49.120 --> 1:48:51.120]  a packet of information
[1:48:51.120 --> 1:48:53.120]  those of you that aren't computer capable
[1:48:53.120 --> 1:48:55.120]  you'll have a packet of information
[1:48:55.120 --> 1:48:57.120]  with the CDs
[1:48:57.120 --> 1:48:59.120]  and some of the lectures where I you know
[1:48:59.120 --> 1:49:01.120]  I'm screaming and hollering making a fool of myself
[1:49:01.120 --> 1:49:03.120]  but that's okay
[1:49:03.120 --> 1:49:05.120]  and on efoodsdirect.com
[1:49:05.120 --> 1:49:07.120]  you can listen to things
[1:49:07.120 --> 1:49:09.120]  and right now we have cataloged
[1:49:09.120 --> 1:49:11.120]  we have cataloged over 200 articles
[1:49:11.120 --> 1:49:13.120]  on just what's happening
[1:49:13.120 --> 1:49:15.120]  that will
[1:49:15.120 --> 1:49:17.120]  support what Alex keeps telling you guys
[1:49:17.120 --> 1:49:19.120]  and what the message that we try
[1:49:19.120 --> 1:49:21.120]  to get across
[1:49:21.120 --> 1:49:23.120]  this is not a marketing operation
[1:49:23.120 --> 1:49:25.120]  anymore is it Alex
[1:49:25.120 --> 1:49:27.120]  it's just a survival operation
[1:49:27.120 --> 1:49:29.120]  we're trying to save lives for Pete's sake
[1:49:29.120 --> 1:49:31.120]  well I mean I think it's important people to have
[1:49:31.120 --> 1:49:33.120]  affordable food I hope things aren't as bad as

[1:52:13.120 --> 1:52:15.120]  that 9-11 was a stage
[1:52:15.120 --> 1:52:17.120]  it was engineered by you
[1:52:17.120 --> 1:52:19.120]  David Rockefeller the fallout or commission to see it far
[1:52:19.120 --> 1:52:21.120]  they said I had a shadow
[1:52:21.120 --> 1:52:23.120]  the day that we stop asking questions
[1:52:23.120 --> 1:52:25.120]  is the day that we have allowed the seeds
[1:52:25.120 --> 1:52:27.120]  of justice to grow at our own door
[1:52:27.120 --> 1:52:29.120]  7 years after
[1:52:29.120 --> 1:52:31.120]  the attacks of September 11
[1:52:31.120 --> 1:52:33.120]  a global awakening has taken place
[1:52:33.120 --> 1:52:35.120]  an inside job
[1:52:35.120 --> 1:52:37.120]  how dare you
[1:52:37.120 --> 1:52:39.120]  I don't know what you're talking about
[1:52:39.120 --> 1:52:41.120]  Justin and Joe it's 9-11
[1:52:41.120 --> 1:52:43.120]  if you know that there's treason going on
[1:52:43.120 --> 1:52:45.120]  you can be held accountable for treason yourself
[1:52:45.120 --> 1:52:47.120]  all hell is breaking loose on 6th avenue
[1:52:47.120 --> 1:52:49.120]  and if the government has not told the truth
[1:52:49.120 --> 1:52:51.120]  in 5 years we will be here
[1:52:51.120 --> 1:52:53.120]  on the 10th anniversary of that
[1:53:01.120 --> 1:53:03.120]  I am at a gathering of friends
[1:53:03.120 --> 1:53:05.120]  minding my own business
[1:53:05.120 --> 1:53:07.120]  when one of our buddies Bob walks up to me
[1:53:07.120 --> 1:53:09.120]  very concerned he says wow
[1:53:09.120 --> 1:53:11.120]  have you seen the gasoline prices lately
[1:53:11.120 --> 1:53:13.120]  and I said oh of course they're high
[1:53:13.120 --> 1:53:15.120]  he says yeah he says what am I going to do
[1:53:15.120 --> 1:53:17.120]  I've got a truck there's no way
[1:53:17.120 --> 1:53:19.120]  in this market I really need the truck
[1:53:19.120 --> 1:53:21.120]  for my job it uses more gas
[1:53:21.120 --> 1:53:23.120]  than I can afford I've got to find a way
[1:53:23.120 --> 1:53:25.120]  to come up with some extra money
[1:53:25.120 --> 1:53:27.120]  I got a wife with 4 kids at home I don't know what to do
[1:53:27.120 --> 1:53:29.120]  I said Bob relax I know what to do
[1:53:29.120 --> 1:53:31.120]  call efoodsdirect.com
[1:53:31.120 --> 1:53:33.120]  or go up on the web at efoodsdirect.com

[1:53:43.120 --> 1:53:45.120]  you can take the savings from that
[1:53:45.120 --> 1:53:47.120]  offset the cost of your fuel
[1:53:47.120 --> 1:53:49.120]  and use it to buy more inexpensive food
[1:53:49.120 --> 1:53:51.120]  to hedge against tomorrow's increasing food prices
[1:53:51.120 --> 1:53:53.120]  why don't you do that Bob
[1:53:53.120 --> 1:53:55.120]  he said efoodsdirect.com
[1:53:55.120 --> 1:53:57.120]  I said yep call him at 1-800-409-5633
[1:53:57.120 --> 1:53:59.120]  that's 800-409-5633
[1:53:59.120 --> 1:54:01.120]  do it now
[1:54:07.120 --> 1:54:09.120]  we're going to call Laney back up
[1:54:09.120 --> 1:54:11.120]  right before
[1:54:11.120 --> 1:54:13.120]  we get
[1:54:13.120 --> 1:54:15.120]  Mark Dyson
[1:54:15.120 --> 1:54:17.120]  with his new book
[1:54:17.120 --> 1:54:19.120]  I'm going to have Bermas in here later
[1:54:19.120 --> 1:54:21.120]  he's watched the news report
[1:54:21.120 --> 1:54:23.120]  read their new baloney
[1:54:23.120 --> 1:54:25.120]  we're going to have him in later in the next hour
[1:54:25.120 --> 1:54:27.120]  going over that
[1:54:27.120 --> 1:54:29.120]  he's in there studying right now
[1:54:29.120 --> 1:54:31.120]  I've always had a load of baloney
[1:54:31.120 --> 1:54:33.120]  how the towers and building 7
[1:54:33.120 --> 1:54:35.120]  supposedly fell
[1:54:35.120 --> 1:54:37.120]  so we're going to be going over that
[1:54:37.120 --> 1:54:39.120]  I want to get that lady back on he says he's a nurse
[1:54:39.120 --> 1:54:41.120]  up in
[1:54:41.120 --> 1:54:43.120]  Arkansas and I already know this
[1:54:43.120 --> 1:54:45.120]  and have already experienced it and know it's a fact
[1:54:45.120 --> 1:54:47.120]  but it's good to hear it from a nurse about how
[1:54:47.120 --> 1:54:49.120]  you go into a hospital it's a prison
[1:54:49.120 --> 1:54:51.120]  you're being surveilled you're being set up
[1:54:51.120 --> 1:54:53.120]  you're being entrapped they want your children
[1:54:53.120 --> 1:54:55.120]  does that mean the doctors and nurses are evil?
[1:54:55.120 --> 1:54:57.120]  no it's just a compartmentalized culture
[1:54:57.120 --> 1:54:59.120]  that they've incrementally turned up
[1:54:59.120 --> 1:55:01.120]  so that's coming up but for this segment
[1:55:01.120 --> 1:55:03.120]  and part of the next
[1:55:03.120 --> 1:55:05.120]  I bring you Ted Anderson
[1:55:05.120 --> 1:55:07.120]  yes we're having some of the sponsors on
[1:55:07.120 --> 1:55:09.120]  having had them on in about a month
[1:55:09.120 --> 1:55:11.120]  having a Stevens group in more than a month
[1:55:11.120 --> 1:55:13.120]  and I wanted to
[1:55:13.120 --> 1:55:15.120]  have Ted on because
[1:55:15.120 --> 1:55:17.120]  there are shortages in gold and silver
[1:55:17.120 --> 1:55:19.120]  it's all over mainstream news
[1:55:19.120 --> 1:55:21.120]  but it dropped and then we know the big central banks
[1:55:21.120 --> 1:55:23.120]  went in and pounded it
[1:55:23.120 --> 1:55:25.120]  and tried to drive it down
[1:55:25.120 --> 1:55:27.120]  but now it's going back up silver and gold
[1:55:27.120 --> 1:55:29.120]  going back up quite a bit today
[1:55:29.120 --> 1:55:31.120]  and they told you all that's it for gold forever
[1:55:31.120 --> 1:55:33.120]  just like they said last summer at the end of the summer it goes down
[1:55:33.120 --> 1:55:35.120]  the fall starts it goes right back up
[1:55:35.120 --> 1:55:37.120]  and to see it as high as it was this summer
[1:55:37.120 --> 1:55:39.120]  portends really high
[1:55:39.120 --> 1:55:41.120]  at least in the past
[1:55:41.120 --> 1:55:43.120]  for this winter
[1:55:43.120 --> 1:55:45.120]  for this fall and winter
[1:55:45.120 --> 1:55:47.120]  and then you've got all the fundamentals of inflation
[1:55:47.120 --> 1:55:49.120]  only increasing at record levels
[1:55:49.120 --> 1:55:51.120]  that's AP headline
[1:55:51.120 --> 1:55:53.120]  dollar devaluation
[1:55:53.120 --> 1:55:55.120]  currency devaluation
[1:55:55.120 --> 1:55:57.120]  that the Fed is only intensifying
[1:55:57.120 --> 1:55:59.120]  so I wanted to have Ted up with the gold and silver shortages
[1:55:59.120 --> 1:56:01.120]  and even though shortages are going
[1:56:01.120 --> 1:56:03.120]  it's been months since he could even get silver dollars
[1:56:03.120 --> 1:56:05.120]  that were reasonable
[1:56:05.120 --> 1:56:07.120]  and they were always like $28, $29 a piece
[1:56:07.120 --> 1:56:09.120]  and then
[1:56:09.120 --> 1:56:11.120]  because they also have collector value
[1:56:11.120 --> 1:56:13.120]  well Ted finally got some
[1:56:13.120 --> 1:56:15.120]  at a reasonable price and he's got them right now today
[1:56:15.120 --> 1:56:17.120]  but Ted tell us
[1:56:17.120 --> 1:56:19.120]  about the KITCO news and other news
[1:56:19.120 --> 1:56:21.120]  oh yeah KITCO right now has the very front page
[1:56:21.120 --> 1:56:23.120]  is talking about the demand for their bullion products
[1:56:23.120 --> 1:56:25.120]  is so high that right now they've delayed deliveries
[1:56:25.120 --> 1:56:27.120]  on everything
[1:56:27.120 --> 1:56:29.120]  matter of fact they're even going to charge a fee
[1:56:29.120 --> 1:56:31.120]  if you try to break the trade with them
[1:56:31.120 --> 1:56:33.120]  if you can't get it quick enough
[1:56:33.120 --> 1:56:35.120]  right now Reuters has a headline out there
[1:56:35.120 --> 1:56:37.120]  American Eagle gold coins are gone
[1:56:37.120 --> 1:56:39.120]  not available in the marketplace
[1:56:39.120 --> 1:56:41.120]  I can't believe that gold coin is gone
[1:56:41.120 --> 1:56:43.120]  now let's talk about free market here, supply and demand
[1:56:43.120 --> 1:56:45.120]  everyone's grabbing gold
[1:56:45.120 --> 1:56:47.120]  snatching it with both hands and silver greedily
[1:56:47.120 --> 1:56:49.120]  because people are smart worldwide
[1:56:49.120 --> 1:56:51.120]  gold purchasing is at record levels
[1:56:51.120 --> 1:56:53.120]  but gold has been dropping
[1:56:53.120 --> 1:56:55.120]  I mean come on
[1:56:55.120 --> 1:56:57.120]  well that's a manipulation
[1:56:57.120 --> 1:56:59.120]  we know that it's like a rubber band right now
[1:56:59.120 --> 1:57:01.120]  I can't wait to see what happens when it cracks loose here
[1:57:01.120 --> 1:57:03.120]  on the other end
[1:57:03.120 --> 1:57:05.120]  the IMF chief
[1:57:05.120 --> 1:57:07.120]  talked about how the United States
[1:57:07.120 --> 1:57:09.120]  banks, I mean high profile
[1:57:09.120 --> 1:57:11.120]  banks are going to be failing
[1:57:11.120 --> 1:57:13.120]  he says that the worst is yet to come
[1:57:13.120 --> 1:57:15.120]  we haven't even seen the worst
[1:57:15.120 --> 1:57:17.120]  Merrill Lynch Wachovia go ahead
[1:57:17.120 --> 1:57:19.120]  I mean that's what's going on right now
[1:57:19.120 --> 1:57:21.120]  I mean we've seen like the countrywide
[1:57:21.120 --> 1:57:23.120]  and all this other stuff fall apart here in the last few months
[1:57:23.120 --> 1:57:25.120]  but the worst is yet to come
[1:57:25.120 --> 1:57:27.120]  that means the Wells Fargo
[1:57:27.120 --> 1:57:29.120]  is the Chase Manhattan
[1:57:29.120 --> 1:57:31.120]  Bank of America is in trouble
[1:57:31.120 --> 1:57:33.120]  yeah all of that stuff and it's
[1:57:33.120 --> 1:57:35.120]  right knocking on our door right now
[1:57:35.120 --> 1:57:37.120]  yes gold and silver is going up obviously
[1:57:37.120 --> 1:57:39.120]  they've manipulated the futures market
[1:57:39.120 --> 1:57:41.120]  not the physicals
[1:57:41.120 --> 1:57:43.120]  nobody wants to sell the physicals
[1:57:43.120 --> 1:57:45.120]  there's not enough supply
[1:57:45.120 --> 1:57:47.120]  you're right about the silver dollars
[1:57:47.120 --> 1:57:49.120]  they're 28 dollars a piece
[1:57:49.120 --> 1:57:51.120]  they did come back with silver down to 21
[1:57:51.120 --> 1:57:53.120]  I picked up a bunch of them for 18 dollars
[1:57:53.120 --> 1:57:55.120]  and 70 cents
[1:57:55.120 --> 1:57:57.120]  and this little group of silver dollars
[1:57:57.120 --> 1:57:59.120]  you know right at 13
[1:57:59.120 --> 1:58:01.120]  now we're almost 14 dollars an ounce silver
[1:58:01.120 --> 1:58:03.120]  this stuff is going to go up like crazy
[1:58:03.120 --> 1:58:05.120]  and so I'm
[1:58:05.120 --> 1:58:07.120]  right now I can't say that there's a better buy
[1:58:07.120 --> 1:58:09.120]  in the marketplace those silver dollars
[1:58:09.120 --> 1:58:11.120]  Alex I couldn't get supply
[1:58:11.120 --> 1:58:13.120]  in the spring
[1:58:13.120 --> 1:58:15.120]  18 dollars and 70 cents is a great price
[1:58:15.120 --> 1:58:17.120]  for silver dollars
[1:58:17.120 --> 1:58:19.120]  so you're shelling them for what you bought them
[1:58:19.120 --> 1:58:21.120]  yeah right now at this particular time it's
[1:58:21.120 --> 1:58:23.120]  you know silver well silver right now
[1:58:23.120 --> 1:58:25.120]  is 14 dollars
[1:58:25.120 --> 1:58:27.120]  18 dollars I mean they're normally
[1:58:27.120 --> 1:58:29.120]  21 bucks that's what I'm carrying them for
[1:58:29.120 --> 1:58:31.120]  so yeah right now this price is just
[1:58:31.120 --> 1:58:33.120]  yeah we're just doing the math there Ted
[1:58:33.120 --> 1:58:35.120]  yeah I mean understand folks the silver dollars
[1:58:35.120 --> 1:58:37.120]  are more than what spots silver is
[1:58:37.120 --> 1:58:39.120]  the Ted is shelling them to you for what he's getting them for
[1:58:39.120 --> 1:58:41.120]  we'll be right back

[1:58:53.120 --> 1:58:55.120]  in the long course of American history
[1:58:55.120 --> 1:58:57.120]  a terrorist act of war
[1:58:57.120 --> 1:58:59.120]  against this country
[1:59:07.120 --> 1:59:09.120]  fabled enemies is the first

[1:59:11.120 --> 1:59:13.120]  ties to intelligence networks
[1:59:13.120 --> 1:59:15.120]  inside the United States
[1:59:15.120 --> 1:59:17.120]  some US investigators believe that there are
[1:59:17.120 --> 1:59:19.120]  Israelis again very much engaged
[1:59:19.120 --> 1:59:21.120]  in spying in and on the US
[1:59:21.120 --> 1:59:23.120]  I'm aware that some Israeli

[2:00:39.120 --> 2:00:41.120]  which is another draft they say with doublespeak
[2:00:41.120 --> 2:00:43.120]  and we have a huge expert
[2:00:43.120 --> 2:00:45.120]  on the anthrax attacks coming on
[2:00:45.120 --> 2:00:47.120]  with our Ted
[2:00:47.120 --> 2:00:49.120]  to continue with the golden silver offer
[2:00:49.120 --> 2:00:51.120]  you have well yeah I mean here's
[2:00:51.120 --> 2:00:53.120]  what I'm talking about you said is there any margin
[2:00:53.120 --> 2:00:55.120]  of profit in there there's a little tiny bit
[2:00:55.120 --> 2:00:57.120]  in there that's why I wouldn't say no I'm not selling
[2:00:57.120 --> 2:00:59.120]  for exactly what I paid 70 cents
[2:00:59.120 --> 2:01:01.120]  yeah I mean it's nothing but
[2:01:01.120 --> 2:01:03.120]  you know here's the thing
[2:01:03.120 --> 2:01:05.120]  the silver dollars
[2:01:05.120 --> 2:01:07.120]  if you didn't call it and say this is the
[2:01:07.120 --> 2:01:09.120]  Alex Jones special
[2:01:09.120 --> 2:01:11.120]  my silver dollars are marked right now at
[2:01:11.120 --> 2:01:13.120]  $21 a piece
[2:01:13.120 --> 2:01:15.120]  a lot getting them elsewhere for that
[2:01:15.120 --> 2:01:17.120]  and that's a fair price for him it really is honestly
[2:01:17.120 --> 2:01:19.120]  and this $18 and 70
[2:01:19.120 --> 2:01:21.120]  cents I was able to go into one of my
[2:01:21.120 --> 2:01:23.120]  also okay fine I'll sell you these bags
[2:01:23.120 --> 2:01:25.120]  and and I was able to just
[2:01:25.120 --> 2:01:27.120]  get him at a blowout price and
[2:01:27.120 --> 2:01:29.120]  and I dropped the price down quite a bit
[2:01:29.120 --> 2:01:31.120]  for everybody to get involved in
[2:01:31.120 --> 2:01:33.120]  I mean everybody should right now take advantage
[2:01:33.120 --> 2:01:35.120]  of $13 silver because silver
[2:01:35.120 --> 2:01:37.120]  right now is almost $14
[2:01:37.120 --> 2:01:39.120]  and obviously with the manipulation
[2:01:39.120 --> 2:01:41.120]  going on and when this thing springs back
[2:01:41.120 --> 2:01:43.120]  I'm going to see 18 to $22 silver again
[2:01:43.120 --> 2:01:45.120]  Chad you're never
[2:01:45.120 --> 2:01:47.120]  dead on you're never sure you're sure

[2:01:49.120 --> 2:01:51.120]  watching what's going on in the economy
[2:01:51.120 --> 2:01:53.120]  and all this other stuff I mean I can't tell you
[2:01:53.120 --> 2:01:55.120]  that this is going to happen today or tomorrow
[2:01:55.120 --> 2:01:57.120]  but I'm telling you right now
[2:01:57.120 --> 2:01:59.120]  major major banks are going to be failing
[2:01:59.120 --> 2:02:01.120]  the Federal Reserve system is going to be
[2:02:01.120 --> 2:02:03.120]  no I mean I've been having you on for
[2:02:03.120 --> 2:02:05.120]  about 10 11 years
[2:02:05.120 --> 2:02:07.120]  and you have never heard you this sure
[2:02:07.120 --> 2:02:09.120]  and then I I mean look at all the inflation
[2:02:09.120 --> 2:02:11.120]  I I mean look at how the golden silver
[2:02:11.120 --> 2:02:13.120]  is running out and they can't hold it down
[2:02:13.120 --> 2:02:15.120]  I agree with you I just
[2:02:15.120 --> 2:02:17.120]  well when you can buy on a dip like this
[2:02:17.120 --> 2:02:19.120]  I mean they I mean usually I'm not you know
[2:02:19.120 --> 2:02:21.120]  you're never quite sure because you know silver's
[2:02:21.120 --> 2:02:23.120]  at $18 just rose from
[2:02:23.120 --> 2:02:25.120]  $16 there's always can be a correction
[2:02:25.120 --> 2:02:27.120]  but this thing is ridiculous what they did
[2:02:27.120 --> 2:02:29.120]  here and they pushed it down too far
[2:02:29.120 --> 2:02:31.120]  the dollars dropping again right now
[2:02:31.120 --> 2:02:33.120]  the head of the IMF bank is
[2:02:33.120 --> 2:02:35.120]  saying that there's worse trouble coming than what we've
[2:02:35.120 --> 2:02:37.120]  seen in the past they're saying depression
[2:02:37.120 --> 2:02:39.120]  yeah I mean what do you need
[2:02:39.120 --> 2:02:41.120]  to have and the handwriting is on the wall

[2:08:07.120 --> 2:08:11.080]  there's a war on for your mind
[2:08:11.080 --> 2:08:17.040]  to intimidate and terrorize the thousands of people they plan to cram
[2:08:17.040 --> 2:08:22.240]  inside the secret FEMA camp that we exposed in Denver they have removed the
[2:08:22.240 --> 2:08:27.280]  big signs that say electro shock devices in use and they've taken down the razor
[2:08:27.280 --> 2:08:37.320]  wire on top of the tall 12-foot fences they have inside the warehouse well the
[2:08:37.320 --> 2:08:44.040]  Austin camp and here 57 they didn't so a kindler gentler secret camp and I love
[2:08:44.040 --> 2:08:47.440]  how the Denver police lied about its existence at first I mean even if you're
[2:08:47.440 --> 2:08:50.440]  for these camps you shouldn't lie about it mark dies is almost at about three

[2:08:59.840 --> 2:09:02.400]  said years ago on this show they got picked up internationally that the
[2:09:02.400 --> 2:09:05.800]  anthrax attacks were an inside job we'll get his latest analysis with the new
[2:09:05.800 --> 2:09:10.640]  info that cover-ups just imploding for them even mainstream news is saying the
[2:09:10.640 --> 2:09:13.920]  FBI is covering up I mean no one's buying with the new order selling
[2:09:13.920 --> 2:09:17.600]  Raimi we had to cut her off as we had a guest on earlier and I wanted her to be
[2:09:17.600 --> 2:09:24.200]  able to finish up before we go to mark dies again I have had my three children
[2:09:24.200 --> 2:09:27.560]  in the local hospital because I know the doctor she's a patriot fan of the show
[2:09:27.560 --> 2:09:32.960]  and I just statistically didn't want to try to go with a midwife and home even
[2:09:32.960 --> 2:09:36.240]  though they're great and it was good to my instinct said do that because my son
[2:09:36.240 --> 2:09:39.920]  was over 10 pounds my wife with a natural childbirth after a day and a half of
[2:09:39.920 --> 2:09:43.400]  labor his heart rate started going down and we went ahead and she had a
[2:09:43.400 --> 2:09:47.160]  cesarean so she's had those ever since once you have one you got to have more
[2:09:47.160 --> 2:09:55.320]  and but but I learned right off the bat though that the nurses would sit there
[2:09:55.320 --> 2:09:59.000]  with a terminal hooked up to the wall this is one of the nicer hospitals it's
[2:09:59.000 --> 2:10:03.000]  really bad at the city ones is a private one hooked up to the wall and I
[2:10:03.000 --> 2:10:05.920]  noticed it was a health department code and they were just and I already knew
[2:10:05.920 --> 2:10:10.680]  they were doing some of this but I had no idea six years ago when I first learned
[2:10:10.680 --> 2:10:16.200]  about this that I learned then at the spot that they sit there and say do you
[2:10:16.200 --> 2:10:19.440]  have enough food do you have enough money if you say no I'd like some more
[2:10:19.440 --> 2:10:23.400]  money it's like your parents got to help you out with money you know women feel
[2:10:23.400 --> 2:10:27.040]  secure they feel safe oh this is my nurse she's helping me no you say you
[2:10:27.040 --> 2:10:31.080]  don't have enough money CPS is coming your kids are probably gone they asked
[2:10:31.080 --> 2:10:34.440]  how you fight with your husband you have a good stable relationship tell me the
[2:10:34.440 --> 2:10:38.800]  truth honey do you feel safe with him well no he's never hit me well I mean do
[2:10:38.800 --> 2:10:44.560]  you guys do you guys fight well yeah oh your kids are gone kids are gone and see
[2:10:44.560 --> 2:10:48.720]  no one's telling you this no one's telling you that quote the school
[2:10:48.720 --> 2:10:51.760]  counselor and elementary and middle school is asking if you spank your
[2:10:51.760 --> 2:10:54.720]  children it's not illegal to but they still take your kids it's like there's
[2:10:54.720 --> 2:10:57.320]  no lot of take vaccines but they'll take them if you don't you know give them a
[2:10:57.320 --> 2:11:01.600]  lot of times if you're ignorant and I learned and then they'd always you know
[2:11:01.600 --> 2:11:04.000]  I learned the first time when it was because I asked my wife later she said
[2:11:04.000 --> 2:11:11.800]  oh you run this file down to the floor beneath me and my instinct said mmm so I
[2:11:11.800 --> 2:11:14.480]  left and I came back I said what was the head nurse asking well she asked
[2:11:14.480 --> 2:11:18.000]  do we have a good home environment and based and then she kept pressing and I
[2:11:18.000 --> 2:11:21.160]  remember her kind of predatorily looking at me the power trip of the evil the
[2:11:21.160 --> 2:11:25.360]  setup the betrayal the wickedness you know they don't tell you a judge jury of
[2:11:25.360 --> 2:11:28.960]  a right to you know counsel they don't tell you this is a law enforcement
[2:11:28.960 --> 2:11:34.880]  operation through the eugenics family court but then the second time they said
[2:11:34.880 --> 2:11:38.240]  hopefully different nurse take the file down and the third time then I found out
[2:11:38.240 --> 2:11:41.600]  it's all over the nation hooked into the health departments that are federalized
[2:11:41.600 --> 2:11:47.160]  and then they take the blood for 35 years and worldwide in the West ship it
[2:11:47.160 --> 2:11:51.840]  to international DNA databases they now admit that a decade after I told you it's
[2:11:51.840 --> 2:11:56.320]  all public I mean this is just a criminal operation all designed so I wanted
[2:11:56.320 --> 2:12:00.680]  to go to a nurse in a hospital where she was saying that now when you come in
[2:12:00.680 --> 2:12:03.680]  they just come in with and just say oh it's part of your course and being in the
[2:12:03.680 --> 2:12:06.960]  hospital we give you all these vaccines oh it's part of the you know it's all
[2:12:06.960 --> 2:12:13.640]  being inculcated like it's the law and I wanted to Rami in Arkansas the nurse be
[2:12:13.640 --> 2:12:18.480]  able to have some comments on this yeah Alex so cool in the city but that's okay
[2:12:18.480 --> 2:12:23.680]  okay I'm sorry they oh I'm sorry go ahead that's okay but yeah they just put it
[2:12:23.680 --> 2:12:27.720]  on the med list people half the time don't know you know that it's a vaccine
[2:12:27.720 --> 2:12:31.880]  if it's for what or you know same way with the meds most the people don't
[2:12:31.880 --> 2:12:36.120]  don't know what meds they're getting don't know why it's just it's a sad
[2:12:36.120 --> 2:12:42.240]  situation and and I've been doing nursing for my whole adult life and I'm
[2:12:42.240 --> 2:12:46.600]  starting to get really sad about it and maybe look for something else to do well
[2:12:46.600 --> 2:12:51.000]  every profession is being taken over by the New World Order spy grid the
[2:12:51.000 --> 2:12:54.800]  pharmacist the doctors the dentist everything now do you work in around the
[2:12:54.800 --> 2:13:00.000]  birthing wing no I don't give it are you aware of the health department
[2:13:00.000 --> 2:13:04.160]  computers yes you know the computers hooked into the health department tell
[2:13:04.160 --> 2:13:10.580]  me about those well I do know that you know like I said we have to check do
[2:13:10.580 --> 2:13:16.120]  we suspect abuse yes or no what kind and then there's a bunch of options they
[2:13:16.120 --> 2:13:21.920]  can choose from you have to put down if you interviewed the patient alone or
[2:13:21.920 --> 2:13:25.880]  with their spouse or family member whoever it might be you know just so
[2:13:25.880 --> 2:13:31.520]  they can put that in perspective a little bit yeah so that so that even if
[2:13:31.520 --> 2:13:35.880]  the woman says no they can still come see PS if she said no because the man
[2:13:35.880 --> 2:13:43.480]  was there yes yes and I do know you know if you come into ER and the doctor
[2:13:43.480 --> 2:13:48.680]  whoever sees you suspect anything that it's a law they have to call DHS now
[2:13:48.680 --> 2:13:52.520]  now folks it's totally predatory and women think they're getting quote free
[2:13:52.520 --> 2:13:56.520]  health care when they go to city things as they're poor you better sell your
[2:13:56.520 --> 2:13:59.960]  cars have your grandparents give you money you do not want to take government
[2:13:59.960 --> 2:14:04.200]  money especially if you've got white children they get $400,000 on the open
[2:14:04.200 --> 2:14:08.400]  market adopting amount and you were literally headed into basically a pack
[2:14:08.400 --> 2:14:12.800]  of bank robbers if you've got a blonde-haired blue-eyed child it is it
[2:14:12.800 --> 2:14:19.360]  is it is just hell force sorry go ahead I'm just gonna say I'm sure I'm in some
[2:14:19.360 --> 2:14:23.360]  database because when I had my son I told him absolutely no
[2:14:23.360 --> 2:14:28.880]  hept B vaccine when I first went in I was against him getting the vitamin K
[2:14:28.880 --> 2:14:33.920]  shot because there have been problems with that I understand there's there can
[2:14:33.920 --> 2:14:37.800]  be some problems when they do some of those newborn screenings yeah it's killed
[2:14:37.800 --> 2:14:42.120]  a bunch of babies the vitamin K almost killed who's the famous actor from the
[2:14:42.120 --> 2:14:49.920]  right stuff oh the one that had the Heparin yeah twin yeah yeah yeah Dennis
[2:14:49.920 --> 2:14:54.800]  Quaid yeah yeah so I'm sure you know automatically when I told the nurse that

[2:15:00.080 --> 2:15:05.080]  they bring in the black off devil the case worker because you dare question

[2:16:04.960 --> 2:16:09.160]  hour thank you so much mark dice you've got a new edition you sold out of the
[2:16:09.160 --> 2:16:14.560]  last one a new edition of your excellent book the resistance manifesto this one
[2:16:14.560 --> 2:16:20.320]  has a gray cover I have one here in my hot little hands and it is just a great
[2:16:20.320 --> 2:16:25.440]  read powerful and compelling as I said about the first one welcome to the
[2:16:25.440 --> 2:16:30.280]  airwaves oh thank you and and I think what I want to do is is help everybody
[2:16:30.280 --> 2:16:34.520]  understand what's going on today by taking a look back at history I think in
[2:16:34.520 --> 2:16:39.440]  order to understand the situation or or even a mechanism today we look at how
[2:16:39.440 --> 2:16:43.920]  it was created the systems that are behind it so later on I want to quote
[2:16:43.920 --> 2:16:49.120]  some writings from Adam Weissop himself so I'm not just going to be saying what
[2:16:49.120 --> 2:16:52.200]  the New World Order is doing what the Illuminati is doing I'm just going to be
[2:16:52.200 --> 2:16:56.480]  reading quotes from the founder of the Illuminati or that the credited founder
[2:16:56.480 --> 2:17:01.240]  Adam Weissop from other Illuminati writers Alice Bailey Helena Blavatsky who
[2:17:01.240 --> 2:17:06.040]  wrote the secret doctrine which was Adolf Hitler's favorite book and and even
[2:17:06.040 --> 2:17:09.280]  some interesting quotes from the founder of the Church of Satan from Anton
[2:17:09.280 --> 2:17:15.280]  Leve which will just prove to show that he is an evil evil sinister man that
[2:17:15.280 --> 2:17:19.960]  that really lies about his true intentions and even his philosophical and
[2:17:19.960 --> 2:17:25.240]  religious belief it's all about deception and the ultimate power to hurt the
[2:17:25.240 --> 2:17:28.880]  innocent in the week it's their pleasure their relish before we do that mark
[2:17:28.880 --> 2:17:33.760]  you're a big part of truth rising such an important film I want to get your take
[2:17:33.760 --> 2:17:39.200]  on truth rising oh just absolutely amazing I mean I must have watched the
[2:17:39.200 --> 2:17:44.200]  film probably four or five times and it's it's unlike anything that that you've
[2:17:44.200 --> 2:17:47.280]  ever done or that anybody's ever done and I think it's going to do two things
[2:17:47.280 --> 2:17:51.080]  not only does it educate but it motivates as well and I know that there's going
[2:17:51.080 --> 2:17:55.040]  to be a lot of people out there now that that can see how easy that how
[2:17:55.040 --> 2:17:58.960]  compelling how energizing it is to get in these people's faces now that
[2:17:58.960 --> 2:18:02.920]  everybody has a YouTube channel they could post this video no two or three
[2:18:02.920 --> 2:18:06.640]  years ago before YouTube or before Google video it'd be very difficult to get
[2:18:06.640 --> 2:18:10.840]  this information out to the masses but now we can throw it up on YouTube you
[2:18:10.840 --> 2:18:15.280]  can go to these people's book signings their campaign stops their dinners
[2:18:15.280 --> 2:18:20.360]  whatever they whatever they do that has access given to the public and confront
[2:18:20.360 --> 2:18:24.520]  them and bring your friends bring multiple cameras I've been hearing a lot
[2:18:24.520 --> 2:18:28.320]  of stuff now about cameras that broadcast wirelessly to the web so that if they do
[2:18:28.320 --> 2:18:32.040]  competent get the camera that the the information the video is going to get
[2:18:32.040 --> 2:18:37.280]  out anyway so this is amazing and I know that we've had a tremendous effect on
[2:18:37.280 --> 2:18:42.520]  them and I mean my god I just I can't give enough praises to not only truth
[2:18:42.520 --> 2:18:45.560]  rising the film and then everybody who put it together but everybody that was
[2:18:45.560 --> 2:18:49.800]  that was in it for everybody that was risking their you know risking their
[2:18:49.800 --> 2:18:53.360]  behind getting out there and getting in everybody's faces and I mean it's some
[2:18:53.360 --> 2:18:57.200]  of the best footage that that I've ever seen things you won't even find on the
[2:18:57.200 --> 2:19:02.960]  the Fox News you know greatest sports tragedies or the most compelling video
[2:19:02.960 --> 2:19:06.680]  you know I mean it's exciting to watch and and I also want to urge everybody
[2:19:06.680 --> 2:19:11.320]  to to not just email people Google links you know to get the DVD give it out to
[2:19:11.320 --> 2:19:14.920]  people it's one thing to get an email from somebody and say hey look at this
[2:19:14.920 --> 2:19:17.480]  video and they have to sit there on the computer but it's another thing if you
[2:19:17.480 --> 2:19:21.240]  actually give them a DVD or a book no your book I love your new book well
[2:19:21.240 --> 2:19:25.080]  that's just you you're a big part of the film and so as we are changing on 11

[2:25:16.400 --> 2:25:20.080]  want to just start off by reading a quote from Adam Weissop founder of the
[2:25:20.080 --> 2:25:24.080]  Illuminati and this was this was discovered back in the late 1700s some
[2:25:24.080 --> 2:25:27.920]  people think that the Illuminati is some fictional creation that it doesn't even
[2:25:27.920 --> 2:25:32.640]  exist but it in history and in history books and in encyclopedia is it admits
[2:25:32.640 --> 2:25:36.720]  that it was a real organization it's disputed by some quote-unquote scholars
[2:25:36.720 --> 2:25:41.400]  as to whether it really continues to exist but this was their plans written
[2:25:41.400 --> 2:25:47.280]  over 230 years ago that were discovered in 1786 and then published for
[2:25:47.280 --> 2:25:52.160]  everybody to read for their own eyes and just let's just read this and see if it
[2:25:52.160 --> 2:25:56.760]  rings true today this is 230 years ago that I'm Weissop wrote this by this
[2:25:56.760 --> 2:26:00.440]  plan which we shall direct all of mankind in this manner and by the simplest
[2:26:00.440 --> 2:26:05.760]  means we shall set all in motion and in flames the occupants must be so allotted
[2:26:05.760 --> 2:26:10.320]  and contrived that we in secret influence all political transactions I've
[2:26:10.320 --> 2:26:14.680]  considered everything and so prepared it and if the order shall this day go into
[2:26:14.680 --> 2:26:21.040]  ruin I shall in a year reestablish it more brilliant than ever there must be
[2:26:21.040 --> 2:26:24.840]  not a single purpose whichever comes into sight that is ambiguous and that
[2:26:24.840 --> 2:26:29.400]  betrays our aims against religion in the state one must speak sometimes in one
[2:26:29.400 --> 2:26:33.120]  way and sometimes another but never to contradict ourselves and so that with
[2:26:33.120 --> 2:26:37.680]  respect to our true way of thinking we may be impenetrable this can be done in
[2:26:37.680 --> 2:26:42.000]  no other way than by secret associations by which the degrees and in silence
[2:26:42.000 --> 2:26:46.640]  possess themselves of the government in the states and make of those means for
[2:26:46.640 --> 2:26:51.040]  this purpose the order will for its own sake and therefore certainly place
[2:26:51.040 --> 2:26:55.280]  every man in a situation for which he will be most effective the pupils are
[2:26:55.280 --> 2:26:59.640]  can try our can convince that the order will rule the world and every member
[2:26:59.640 --> 2:27:03.480]  therefore becomes a ruler
[2:27:03.480 --> 2:27:06.600]  now that's adam wife up himself two hundred thirty years ago
[2:27:06.600 --> 2:27:08.860]  and this is before television before
[2:27:08.860 --> 2:27:13.280]  uh... mass media before anything in the in the debate they understood the power
[2:27:13.280 --> 2:27:17.160]  of shaping public opinions and and i'm just gonna go on here
[2:27:17.160 --> 2:27:20.720]  by establishing reading societies and subscription libraries and taking these
[2:27:20.720 --> 2:27:23.680]  under our direction and supplying them through our labors
[2:27:23.680 --> 2:27:26.880]  we may turn the public mind which way we will
[2:27:26.880 --> 2:27:30.640]  in like manner we must obtain influence in the military academy this might be of
[2:27:30.640 --> 2:27:35.000]  certain consequence the printing houses bookseller shops chapters
[2:27:35.000 --> 2:27:38.840]  in short all offices which have any effect either informing
[2:27:38.840 --> 2:27:39.960]  or managing
[2:27:39.960 --> 2:27:42.240]  and in directing the mind of man
[2:27:42.240 --> 2:27:45.680]  painting and engraving are highly worth our care
[2:27:45.680 --> 2:27:50.320]  we get all the literary journals we take care by well-timed pieces
[2:27:50.320 --> 2:27:53.460]  uh... to make citizens and princes a little more noticed
[2:27:53.460 --> 2:27:56.120]  for their certain little
[2:27:56.120 --> 2:27:59.680]  so they knew two hundred thirty years ago the power of controlling the media
[2:27:59.680 --> 2:28:01.120]  and they wrote
[2:28:01.120 --> 2:28:05.120]  plain and simple their plans down for everybody to see all these quotes are
[2:28:05.120 --> 2:28:06.960]  are fully admitted legitimate
[2:28:06.960 --> 2:28:10.680]  uh... by historians and they're they're found in several books several hundred
[2:28:10.680 --> 2:28:14.200]  years old and i reprint them in the resistance manifesto
[2:28:14.200 --> 2:28:18.280]  and so anybody that just doubt that even such an organization exists for that
[2:28:18.280 --> 2:28:22.040]  there are there are plans to control the media to control political institutions
[2:28:22.040 --> 2:28:23.560]  just needs to look at their own
[2:28:23.560 --> 2:28:27.120]  throne writing so this is just me saying this this is just
[2:28:27.120 --> 2:28:30.240]  alex jones saying this is what they're doing if you look at their own
[2:28:30.240 --> 2:28:31.480]  documents their own
[2:28:31.480 --> 2:28:34.920]  publicly released writings you can just see for yourselves
[2:28:34.920 --> 2:28:37.920]  uh... what what their plans are now that was in an earlier phase they want to
[2:28:37.920 --> 2:28:40.920]  just credit government take it over now they have the government
[2:28:40.920 --> 2:28:43.200]  they're on the further phase of destroying
[2:28:43.200 --> 2:28:45.560]  independent relationships families
[2:28:45.560 --> 2:28:48.400]  destroying the basic building blocks of society which they said they would do
[2:28:48.400 --> 2:28:50.040]  later
[2:28:50.040 --> 2:28:54.040]  yeah i don't know that's that's a writing from adam wiss often from uh...
[2:28:54.040 --> 2:28:58.240]  Xavier bonds whack what one of the other fellow members of of the original
[2:28:58.240 --> 2:28:59.800]  the very in a luminati
[2:28:59.800 --> 2:29:03.520]  and they go on to say that they're planning to destroy christianity to
[2:29:03.520 --> 2:29:04.400]  replace
[2:29:04.400 --> 2:29:05.880]  all government
[2:29:05.880 --> 2:29:07.400]  uh... to use
[2:29:07.400 --> 2:29:10.280]  uh... feminism to break down society
[2:29:10.280 --> 2:29:13.280]  and you know for some people that think that the illuminati was uh...
[2:29:13.280 --> 2:29:16.960]  just a free-thinking organization of men that were fighting uh... the other
[2:29:16.960 --> 2:29:20.400]  depression of the church really just need to understand and investigate it
[2:29:20.400 --> 2:29:24.520]  what a dirt bag adam wiss often was impregnated sister-in-law he
[2:29:24.520 --> 2:29:26.160]  uh... tried to kill her

[2:29:36.120 --> 2:29:37.120]  powder that they would
[2:29:37.120 --> 2:29:40.000]  blow in people's face that would blind them or kill them
[2:29:40.000 --> 2:29:42.000]  uh... they had gasses that they would
[2:29:42.000 --> 2:29:45.800]  uh... in fact inject into people's houses to kill them
[2:29:45.800 --> 2:29:48.920]  uh... they had counterfeiting tools stay there stay there let's talk more

[2:34:16.760 --> 2:34:22.760]  as a friend and as a colleague and that he's here with us today
[2:34:22.760 --> 2:34:24.760]  the resistance manifesto
[2:34:24.760 --> 2:34:27.760]  I continue
[2:34:27.760 --> 2:34:31.760]  covering some more of Adam Weissop's evil deeds they had
[2:34:31.760 --> 2:34:35.760]  they had found black op tools a collection of hundreds of
[2:34:35.760 --> 2:34:38.760]  seals because back then people would have wax
[2:34:38.760 --> 2:34:41.760]  seals in a seal that they would stamp on an envelope or a letter
[2:34:41.760 --> 2:34:45.760]  to prove that it wasn't open and prove that it had come from that person so
[2:34:45.760 --> 2:34:49.760]  these individuals had procured various methods for faking these
[2:34:49.760 --> 2:34:54.760]  they had pestilent vapors that they would inject into people's homes so that they would die
[2:34:54.760 --> 2:35:01.760]  there was a sheet containing information about a T for procuring abortions and such
[2:35:01.760 --> 2:35:05.760]  and so for anybody that thinks that they were an enlightenment group of gentlemen
[2:35:05.760 --> 2:35:08.760]  it was a gentleman's club fighting the oppression of the church
[2:35:08.760 --> 2:35:14.760]  doesn't fully understand that and the same goes with Anton Levet the founder of the church of Satan
[2:35:14.760 --> 2:35:20.760]  a lot of people think that he's just a atheistic Satanist and it's just a different world
[2:35:20.760 --> 2:35:25.760]  philosophy but let's let's see what Anton Levet himself has to say about his hopes
[2:35:25.760 --> 2:35:29.760]  for the Satanic Bible and and then what's found in his authorized biography
[2:35:29.760 --> 2:35:33.760]  written by his second wife so you know somebody anybody can write a biography
[2:35:33.760 --> 2:35:38.760]  about somebody this is the authorized biography so that means his his ex-wife
[2:35:38.760 --> 2:35:44.760]  for his is really his widow approved this book his estate approved it and she
[2:35:44.760 --> 2:35:49.760]  wrote this book so it goes on here on page 216 of his authorized
[2:35:49.760 --> 2:35:54.760]  biography to say that investigators no matter how objective they may be may
[2:35:54.760 --> 2:35:58.760]  become disturbed by the increasing number of Satanic Bible founded crime scenes
[2:35:58.760 --> 2:36:03.760]  and in the personal effects of mass murderers it may be that Levet's Satanic thought
[2:36:03.760 --> 2:36:08.760]  can release forces within unstable people other they are not able to control
[2:36:08.760 --> 2:36:12.760]  Anton maintains that he isn't really concerned about accusations of people killing people
[2:36:12.760 --> 2:36:16.760]  named Satan he swears that each time he reads of a new killing spree his only
[2:36:16.760 --> 2:36:23.760]  reaction is what 22 people is that all he goes on to say there will undoubtedly
[2:36:23.760 --> 2:36:27.760]  be more Satanic motivated murders and crimes in the sense that the Satanic Bible
[2:36:27.760 --> 2:36:33.760]  tells you you don't have to take any more expletive and he goes on to say
[2:36:33.760 --> 2:36:37.760]  here that the only way that I would like to help is Levet here are the only way
[2:36:37.760 --> 2:36:39.760]  that he would like to help the great majority of people in the same way that
[2:36:39.760 --> 2:36:44.760]  Carl Panzram serial killer quote reformed people who tried to reform him it
[2:36:44.760 --> 2:36:49.760]  would be most mercifully to help them by relieving them of the stress in the life
[2:36:49.760 --> 2:36:52.760]  that they seem to hate so much people should be happy that I'm not a
[2:36:52.760 --> 2:36:57.760]  humanitarian or I would be the most diabolical mass murderer of the world
[2:36:57.760 --> 2:37:01.760]  has ever known that's that's coming from Anton Levet from his own mouth that he
[2:37:01.760 --> 2:37:06.760]  he wants people to use his book he hopes that the panic philosophies will
[2:37:06.760 --> 2:37:10.760]  encourage people to destroy one another in an interview in newsweek back in
[2:37:10.760 --> 2:37:15.760]  1971 shortly after the church of satan was founded and his book the
[2:37:15.760 --> 2:37:19.760]  panic bible was published he admitted that one of his goals this is in a
[2:37:19.760 --> 2:37:23.760]  newsweek article of one of his goals was the creation of a police state in
[2:37:23.760 --> 2:37:26.760]  which weak people were weeded out and they quote achievement oriented
[2:37:26.760 --> 2:37:31.760]  leadership were permitted to pursue the mysteries of black magic and some
[2:37:31.760 --> 2:37:35.760]  people say that Anton Levet and that quote Satanists don't really worship
[2:37:35.760 --> 2:37:39.760]  Satan that they're atheists but it's interesting that Anton Levet in his
[2:37:39.760 --> 2:37:44.760]  own authorized biography talks about using prayer to try to help with a
[2:37:44.760 --> 2:37:48.760]  child of what I believe it was one of his girlfriends Jane Jane Mansfield
[2:37:48.760 --> 2:37:53.760]  she had a little boy that was injured in an accident and so he got his fellow
[2:37:53.760 --> 2:37:58.760]  Satan worshippers together and they prayed to Satan asking for Satan to
[2:37:58.760 --> 2:38:03.760]  help the little boy get well and recover which is very strange considering
[2:38:03.760 --> 2:38:07.760]  the the founder of the the current high priest of the church of Satan Peter
[2:38:07.760 --> 2:38:12.760]  Gilmore who I interviewed said that Satanists don't believe in religious
[2:38:12.760 --> 2:38:17.760]  nonsense yet here we have Anton Levet in his own authorized biography admitting
[2:38:17.760 --> 2:38:22.760]  that they have prayed to Satan to try to bestow blessings and and help
[2:38:22.760 --> 2:38:26.760]  somebody but you know they they insult people who want to pray and believe in
[2:38:26.760 --> 2:38:31.760]  God and ask for Jesus blessings but apparently he thinks it's okay and not
[2:38:31.760 --> 2:38:35.760]  hypocritical to to ask for Satan's help and Peter Gilmore the current high
[2:38:35.760 --> 2:38:40.760]  priest of the church of Satan described the satanic church as quote
[2:38:40.760 --> 2:38:44.760]  the organization is a cabal a shadowy underground network of like-minded
[2:38:44.760 --> 2:38:48.760]  individuals who work to lever against the inertia of the world towards
[2:38:48.760 --> 2:38:54.760]  ends favorable to Satanism Levet used Orwell 1984 model for a cell
[2:38:54.760 --> 2:38:59.760]  system in which each member didn't have awareness of exactly who else might
[2:38:59.760 --> 2:39:03.760]  be involved and then if we get into some teachings from Alistair Crowley again
[2:39:03.760 --> 2:39:08.760]  who some some satanic apologists think that he was just it another
[2:39:08.760 --> 2:39:14.760]  enlightenment of the author and a fellow a truth seeker if you actually
[2:39:14.760 --> 2:39:18.760]  read his books not only the one in theory magic and theory and practice where
[2:39:18.760 --> 2:39:22.760]  he describes instructions on how to give human sacrifices and says that the
[2:39:22.760 --> 2:39:27.760]  best spiritual victim is an innocent male child of it by by sacrificing this
[2:39:27.760 --> 2:39:31.760]  child because it has an innocent pure soul that you somehow gather its
[2:39:31.760 --> 2:39:35.760]  energy he sees he says that openly in one of his books in one of his most
[2:39:35.760 --> 2:39:42.760]  famous books the book of the law he goes on to say that he is the god that
[2:39:42.760 --> 2:39:46.760]  this god that was dictating this book to him apparently he says
[2:39:46.760 --> 2:39:51.760]  compassion is the vice of kings stamp down the wretched in the week this is
[2:39:51.760 --> 2:39:55.760]  the law of the strong this is our law and the joy of the world now let it be
[2:39:55.760 --> 2:39:59.760]  understood if the body of the king dissolve he shall remain in ecstasy
[2:39:59.760 --> 2:40:05.760]  forever he says note let it be now known and first understood that i am the
[2:40:05.760 --> 2:40:09.760]  god of war and vengeance worship me with blood and fire worship me with
[2:40:09.760 --> 2:40:15.760]  swords and spears this is my command he goes on to say i will give i will
[2:40:15.760 --> 2:40:20.760]  give of their flesh to eat sacrifice cattle little and big after a child
[2:40:20.760 --> 2:40:25.760]  kill and torture i'm reading directly from the book here kill and torture
[2:40:25.760 --> 2:40:29.760]  spare not be upon them the best blood is out of the moon shortly then the
[2:40:29.760 --> 2:40:34.760]  flesh of a child or the dropping of the host of heaven then of enemies then of
[2:40:34.760 --> 2:40:38.760]  a priest or the worshipers and then he goes on to say that he wants to pack
[2:40:38.760 --> 2:40:44.760]  the eyes out of jesus he cursed them with my hawk's head i pack the eyes out
[2:40:44.760 --> 2:40:48.760]  of jesus as he hangs from across so these this isn't just me saying that
[2:40:48.760 --> 2:40:52.760]  these are a bunch of evil despicable people if you just read their own
[2:40:52.760 --> 2:40:56.760]  words in their own books that are published they just admit it
[2:40:56.760 --> 2:41:00.760]  well they also talk about how they con their own members they talk about
[2:41:00.760 --> 2:41:05.760]  how we tell the idiots that it's really white and black magic are the same
[2:41:05.760 --> 2:41:09.760]  and and and then these morons come in and we tell them we don't really
[2:41:09.760 --> 2:41:13.760]  believe in all this evil so we can then feed on them look at how dumb they are
[2:41:13.760 --> 2:41:17.760]  it's all about the more deceptive you can be the more innocent you can hurt
[2:41:17.760 --> 2:41:20.760]  and it is a satanic world system running things and they believe they get more
[2:41:20.760 --> 2:41:24.760]  power and that's why dying corn howlbert and run giant child kidnapping rings
[2:41:24.760 --> 2:41:28.760]  and they'll make a big deal in the news about some degenerate rock star and
[2:41:28.760 --> 2:41:32.760]  you know vietnam raping ten-year-old girls which is horrible but then
[2:41:32.760 --> 2:41:36.760]  grandstand how they're good all day and they build up a giant anti-kidnapping
[2:41:36.760 --> 2:41:41.760]  global system which is really designed to enter polls so they can kidnap who they want
[2:41:41.760 --> 2:41:44.760]  you're right now and i've heard you say this many times and and i know that
[2:41:44.760 --> 2:41:49.760]  there are some some atheist listeners out there but this this core people
[2:41:49.760 --> 2:41:53.760]  this this core group of the so-called enlightened ones this Illuminati they believe
[2:41:53.760 --> 2:41:57.760]  in a spiritual world they believe in spiritual laws they believe in a god or
[2:41:57.760 --> 2:42:01.760]  two gods or a force that manifests itself in in two different forms
[2:42:01.760 --> 2:42:05.760]  and so they are trying to keep everybody away from this power away from the
[2:42:05.760 --> 2:42:09.760]  spiritual laws so that they can use it themselves and albert pike admits this
[2:42:09.760 --> 2:42:13.760]  in morals and dogma morals and dogma some people might have heard these quotes
[2:42:13.760 --> 2:42:16.760]  you know on the internet you hear people talking about these things but when i was investigating this
[2:42:16.760 --> 2:42:19.760]  i thought it was so ridiculous i never believed that somebody to write such a thing
[2:42:19.760 --> 2:42:22.760]  so i went out i bought all the books so these quotes that i'm reading to you
[2:42:22.760 --> 2:42:25.760]  aren't just off of some website that i pulled that have been
[2:42:25.760 --> 2:42:30.760]  you know copied and pasted over over dozens and dozens of pages these quotes
[2:42:30.760 --> 2:42:35.760]  i am pulling directly out of the books i own these books i own morals and dogma
[2:42:35.760 --> 2:42:39.760]  where albert pike says that masonry like all religions and
[2:42:39.760 --> 2:42:43.760]  and mysteries conceals reading right from the book conceals
[2:42:43.760 --> 2:42:47.760]  it's secrets from all except the adepts and the sages or the elect and he goes on
[2:42:47.760 --> 2:42:50.760]  to say how much he loves lucifer i want you to get into that in a moment
[2:42:50.760 --> 2:42:55.760]  meanwhile mason's going to their halls all of them and albert pike hanging in it
[2:42:55.760 --> 2:42:58.760]  and if you tell them you're really worshipping lucifer it'll be fighting words
[2:42:58.760 --> 2:43:03.760]  they've never read the writings of the books that he himself published
[2:43:03.760 --> 2:43:08.760]  so this is also part of the bigger joke that their own members don't know what they're part of
[2:43:08.760 --> 2:43:12.760]  yeah of course none of the lower level members and you know when i first started
[2:43:12.760 --> 2:43:15.760]  investigating this i couldn't believe that's a huge organization will be full of
[2:43:15.760 --> 2:43:19.760]  satan worshippers but then you find out that the three lower levels you know
[2:43:19.760 --> 2:43:22.760]  somebody gets to a master mason you think oh that's a that's some high level
[2:43:22.760 --> 2:43:26.760]  mason that's just the third level they're not even in the lodger that's the third
[2:43:26.760 --> 2:43:29.760]  step they're still considered porch mason they haven't even been told about the
[2:43:29.760 --> 2:43:33.760]  higher levels of mystery so nobody's going to find this this quote-unquote
[2:43:33.760 --> 2:43:37.760]  uh... you know brought royal secret or the secret doctrine until they get up to
[2:43:37.760 --> 2:43:41.760]  the to the high levels and then they're going to be chosen to be awarded with
[2:43:41.760 --> 2:43:44.760]  this knowledge and in his own book he says that not only
[2:43:44.760 --> 2:43:47.760]  that they can seal the truth from their own members this is in his own words he
[2:43:47.760 --> 2:43:51.760]  says that they use quote false explanations and and misinterpretations
[2:43:51.760 --> 2:43:55.760]  of the symbols to mislead those who deserve to be misled and to conceal the
[2:43:55.760 --> 2:44:00.760]  truth which it called light from them to draw them further away from it and then
[2:44:00.760 --> 2:44:03.760]  later on he goes on to say yeah lucifer the lightbearer strange and mysterious
[2:44:03.760 --> 2:44:07.760]  name to give to the spirit of darkness lucifer the son of more of the morning
[2:44:07.760 --> 2:44:11.760]  is that he who bears the light doubt it not doubt it not with an explanation
[2:44:11.760 --> 2:44:14.760]  point so you can just draw your own conclusions as to whether they're
[2:44:14.760 --> 2:44:18.760]  luciferian and look now again we're talking manly peahall abert pike the
[2:44:18.760 --> 2:44:22.760]  former heads of global masonry tell the listeners this is all footnote in your
[2:44:22.760 --> 2:44:26.760]  book there was this manifesto uh... the new addition but but for mason's who
[2:44:26.760 --> 2:44:30.760]  might be listening i had a lot of family were mason's they weren't bad people
[2:44:30.760 --> 2:44:34.760]  they were lower level but some that did become high level told my dad you know
[2:44:34.760 --> 2:44:38.760]  one of his uh... grandfather one of his great uncle said do not join us
[2:44:38.760 --> 2:44:42.760]  with the higher levels it is not what you're told because texas alone start
[2:44:42.760 --> 2:44:46.760]  state big into mason's is not saying george washington's bad it's not saying
[2:44:46.760 --> 2:44:50.760]  they didn't understand that this is how the evil controls good people by saying
[2:44:50.760 --> 2:44:55.760]  oh it's a fraternal order of good but at the top it's bad uh... and and and
[2:44:55.760 --> 2:44:58.760]  has been bottom line taken over by these people give the mason's out there
[2:44:58.760 --> 2:45:03.760]  listening to footnotes again well you can go to page three twenty one and
[2:45:03.760 --> 2:45:07.760]  morris and dogma where he admits that lucifer bears the lights uh... in the
[2:45:07.760 --> 2:45:11.760]  book he admits that free masonry is a religion a lot of the free mason's
[2:45:11.760 --> 2:45:15.760]  will deny and even the head of the lodge that you can history channel denies
[2:45:15.760 --> 2:45:19.760]  that free masonry is a religion uh... in albert pike's book which is the bible
[2:45:19.760 --> 2:45:23.760]  of free masonry contains all the rituals for all the different levels
[2:45:23.760 --> 2:45:27.760]  uh... when the book was originally published a hundred years ago upon the
[2:45:27.760 --> 2:45:30.760]  death it said this right on the book upon the death of a member the book needed
[2:45:30.760 --> 2:45:33.760]  to be returned up to the lodge because they didn't want that getting out
[2:45:33.760 --> 2:45:38.760]  and and having people understand that and so it is a religion uh... they go on
[2:45:38.760 --> 2:45:41.760]  here he says in the in the twenty-eighth degree in the night of the sun
[2:45:41.760 --> 2:45:45.760]  or the prince of death that the true word of the mason is to be found concealed
[2:45:45.760 --> 2:45:49.760]  in and in a profound meeting of the ineffable name of deity which the name
[2:45:49.760 --> 2:45:53.760]  was lost by and various precautions were taken to conceal it
[2:45:53.760 --> 2:45:57.760]  okay so they're they're hiding the actual truth he admits it right there in the
[2:45:57.760 --> 2:46:01.760]  book on page one of four and one of five that they have concealed and that the
[2:46:01.760 --> 2:46:04.760]  word concealed is emphasized in the original i have the original book
[2:46:04.760 --> 2:46:08.760]  it's it's emphasized they can feel the secrets from all except the adept in
[2:46:08.760 --> 2:46:12.760]  the pages so just because somebody's a third-level master mason and they
[2:46:12.760 --> 2:46:15.760]  they go and they help the children and they they run around to do different
[2:46:15.760 --> 2:46:18.760]  community events doesn't mean that they're bad it's just like if you go to a
[2:46:18.760 --> 2:46:22.760]  a fraternity party or if you work for a business if the chief comes up to the
[2:46:22.760 --> 2:46:26.760]  top level or are doing all sorts of crimes or if the the frat boys up
[2:46:26.760 --> 2:46:30.760]  upstairs in the in the belt in the bedrooms are are dealing coke or
[2:46:30.760 --> 2:46:33.760]  raping somebody doesn't mean that you're bad because you're there but you need to
[2:46:33.760 --> 2:46:36.760]  be aware of this that they are lying to you that they're doing this knowingly
[2:46:36.760 --> 2:46:40.760]  and willingly that this is a power structure and some of the Illuminati
[2:46:40.760 --> 2:46:45.760]  writings such as Alice Bailey admits this freely now we have we have some people
[2:46:45.760 --> 2:46:48.760]  that write about the Illuminati and these these enlightenment groups trying to
[2:46:48.760 --> 2:46:51.760]  expose them but we have some people that write about them to spread their
[2:46:51.760 --> 2:46:55.760]  message and these books are hidden in plain view they're given to high level
[2:46:55.760 --> 2:46:59.760]  members the skull and bones leaders and in the such where they go on to say
[2:46:59.760 --> 2:47:03.760]  here's a here's Alice Bailey in her book externalization of the hierarchy where
[2:47:03.760 --> 2:47:06.760]  she freely admits the members of the hierarchy are to be seen at the
[2:47:06.760 --> 2:47:09.760]  custodians of the divine plan the spiritual hierarchy the planet and the
[2:47:09.760 --> 2:47:14.760]  ability of mankind to to contact its members and to work in cooperation with
[2:47:14.760 --> 2:47:17.760]  them in the existence of the greater hierarchy of spiritual energies of
[2:47:17.760 --> 2:47:21.760]  which our tiny planetary sphere is part as it goes on to say that the fact that
[2:47:21.760 --> 2:47:25.760]  the hierarchy consists of hundreds of thousands today though still denied by
[2:47:25.760 --> 2:47:28.760]  the orthodox the general public is familiar with the idea of the existence of
[2:47:28.760 --> 2:47:32.760]  the mysteries and either goldly accept the massive futile and idiotic
[2:47:32.760 --> 2:47:36.760]  information handed out today by many who fight against it and spread this in
[2:47:36.760 --> 2:47:39.760]  the spread of this teaching so there they're admitting that there is this
[2:47:39.760 --> 2:47:43.760]  the secret group and later on it goes on to say that they have it fully
[2:47:43.760 --> 2:47:47.760]  infiltrated the churches there will be an implicated work of the masses
[2:47:47.760 --> 2:47:50.760]  trained by the spiritual and minded people the world working with the
[2:47:50.760 --> 2:47:54.760]  churches whenever possible under an enlightened clergy to accept the fact
[2:47:54.760 --> 2:47:58.760]  that of the approaching spiritual energy focused on the spiritual hierarchy
[2:47:58.760 --> 2:48:02.760]  so if you just look in their own books you can understand this and this is all
[2:48:02.760 --> 2:48:06.760]  written up hundreds of years ago or fifty-eight years ago and so it makes
[2:48:06.760 --> 2:48:10.760]  things today seem a little bit more in place now we can understand we have
[2:48:10.760 --> 2:48:13.760]  Operation Mockingbird where they're controlling the media we have the
[2:48:13.760 --> 2:48:16.760]  Council on Foreign Relations the Trilateral Commission the Bilderberg group
[2:48:16.760 --> 2:48:21.760]  these private organizations now that that are quasi-governmental or that the
[2:48:21.760 --> 2:48:24.760]  public thinks are government organizations when if you just look back to
[2:48:24.760 --> 2:48:27.760]  Adam Weissop's writings two hundred and thirty years ago that they planned this
[2:48:27.760 --> 2:48:34.760]  and by the way we haven't even covered here today one of the chapters in this
[2:48:34.760 --> 2:48:39.760]  four hundred and fifty something page long book the resistance manifesto
[2:48:39.760 --> 2:48:44.760]  available at markdice.com what about people listening on AM and FM or people

[2:49:41.760 --> 2:49:45.760]  clear I'm gonna have to have you back up Mark in the next few weeks when I get
[2:49:45.760 --> 2:49:49.760]  back from Denver to to get into some of the other segments when we come back I
[2:49:49.760 --> 2:49:52.760]  want to bring Bermas in about the NIST report you're a big 9-11 truth or get
[2:49:52.760 --> 2:49:55.760]  some of your response to that some of what's in the book and also play this
[2:49:55.760 --> 2:50:01.760]  clip of Jerome Corsi you know denying 9-11 truth kind of backpedaling a bit
[2:50:01.760 --> 2:50:06.760]  on Hannity and Combs last night where I got brought up and we got this big guest
[2:50:06.760 --> 2:50:12.760]  Mr. Boyle, Professor Boyle coming up the last 52 minutes of the show but I want
[2:50:12.760 --> 2:50:15.760]  to we've got two little segments left with you Mark and I want to share this
[2:50:15.760 --> 2:50:19.760]  with Bermas because we're trying to condense so much under the show but
[2:50:19.760 --> 2:50:23.760]  your book I mean it really condenses it all I mean each chapter is super readable
[2:50:23.760 --> 2:50:27.760]  it's jam-packed with info this is the kind of book I like and I just want to
[2:50:27.760 --> 2:50:32.760]  commend you for doing such a great job and I just want to say too because I
[2:50:32.760 --> 2:50:35.760]  saw all these quotes I heard these allegations I didn't believe them I
[2:50:35.760 --> 2:50:38.760]  spent a lot of money on all these books and so I pulled out the quotes from
[2:50:38.760 --> 2:50:41.760]  your own authors I put my analysis I combined a bunch of mainstream news
[2:50:41.760 --> 2:50:45.760]  reports with it so instead of supporting these Hispanic authors and
[2:50:45.760 --> 2:50:48.760]  supporting the Church of Satan and going and buying the Titanic Bible or
[2:50:48.760 --> 2:50:51.760]  biography to see if what I'm telling you is true you know I just ask you to
[2:50:51.760 --> 2:50:55.760]  support me and get the manifesto and go to the library and read their books
[2:50:55.760 --> 2:50:59.760]  don't buy them okay we'll be right back we're gonna go live on prisonplanet.tv
[2:50:59.760 --> 2:51:01.760]  next segment.
[2:51:01.760 --> 2:51:06.760]  Today unlike any other in the long course of American history a terrorist act of
[2:51:06.760 --> 2:51:08.760]  war against this country.
[2:51:08.760 --> 2:51:10.760]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[2:51:10.760 --> 2:51:12.760]  But who is the enemy?
[2:51:12.760 --> 2:51:13.760]  bin Laden.
[2:51:13.760 --> 2:51:14.760]  This is his MO.
[2:51:14.760 --> 2:51:15.760]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[2:51:15.760 --> 2:51:17.760]  We have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[2:51:17.760 --> 2:51:21.760]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist
[2:51:21.760 --> 2:51:24.760]  ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[2:51:24.760 --> 2:51:28.760]  Some US investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much
[2:51:28.760 --> 2:51:31.760]  engaged in spying in and on the US.
[2:51:31.760 --> 2:51:35.760]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[2:51:35.760 --> 2:51:37.760]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA.
[2:51:37.760 --> 2:51:39.760]  The hijackers ties to the FBI.
[2:51:39.760 --> 2:51:40.760]  The Saudi Arabian connection.
[2:51:40.760 --> 2:51:42.760]  The Israeli intelligence network.
[2:51:42.760 --> 2:51:43.760]  Warnings in war games.
[2:51:43.760 --> 2:51:44.760]  The shadow government.
[2:51:44.760 --> 2:51:45.760]  And much much more.

[2:52:29.760 --> 2:52:33.760]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my day tonight with Rachel.

[2:53:01.760 --> 2:53:05.760]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors in maintaining
[2:53:05.760 --> 2:53:07.760]  high energy and vibrant health?
[2:53:07.760 --> 2:53:12.760]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 9 or higher.
[2:53:12.760 --> 2:53:17.760]  Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals and elements.
[2:53:17.760 --> 2:53:21.760]  This product is a one of a kind in its strength and effectiveness.
[2:53:21.760 --> 2:53:26.760]  Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline while
[2:53:26.760 --> 2:53:29.760]  helping you get rid of acid and regaining your health and energy.
[2:53:29.760 --> 2:53:35.760]  With just 10 drops, you can raise the pH level of the water you drink up to the pH of 10.
[2:53:35.760 --> 2:53:40.760]  Alkalizing water helps the body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen
[2:53:40.760 --> 2:53:41.760]  content of your body.
[2:53:41.760 --> 2:53:47.760]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline environment.

[2:53:55.760 --> 2:54:07.760]  The only thing that's real, the needle tears the hole.
[2:54:07.760 --> 2:54:13.760]  Shane Geiger, the M4Wars.com reporter that got his question asked at NIST and their big whitewash
[2:54:13.760 --> 2:54:16.760]  is going to be joining us in the next segment.
[2:54:16.760 --> 2:54:18.760]  We've got Jason Bermas in studio with us.
[2:54:18.760 --> 2:54:24.760]  We're streaming live right now on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[2:54:24.760 --> 2:54:26.760]  And we got Jason Bermas in studio with us.
[2:54:26.760 --> 2:54:28.760]  I'm going to miss Jason Bermas.
[2:54:28.760 --> 2:54:38.760]  He's been down here for, what, five plus months and we just really enjoy having him with us.
[2:54:38.760 --> 2:54:42.760]  And he's going to come back down and make another film with us next year.
[2:54:42.760 --> 2:54:45.760]  I've really gotten attached to having Bermie.
[2:54:45.760 --> 2:54:47.760]  He hates that nickname.
[2:54:47.760 --> 2:54:49.760]  Everybody needs to start using it.
[2:54:49.760 --> 2:54:53.760]  Here with us in town, but he'll be back with the M4Wars team.
[2:54:53.760 --> 2:54:59.760]  But we've got Mark Dice, who I want to have again on, talk about his book when I get back into town.
[2:54:59.760 --> 2:55:02.760]  But right now, I wanted to play some audio.
[2:55:02.760 --> 2:55:03.760]  The video is up on YouTube.
[2:55:03.760 --> 2:55:04.760]  We're going to get it posted.
[2:55:04.760 --> 2:55:06.760]  And they talk about me a bunch.
[2:55:06.760 --> 2:55:09.760]  They talk about his evil saying he wants to investigate 9-11.
[2:55:09.760 --> 2:55:11.760]  He does backpedal.
[2:55:11.760 --> 2:55:15.760]  He does say basically that it points towards inside job and he was on my show.
[2:55:15.760 --> 2:55:17.760]  So Jerome Corsi is backpedaling.
[2:55:17.760 --> 2:55:18.760]  It's all over the New York Times.
[2:55:18.760 --> 2:55:19.760]  You name it.
[2:55:19.760 --> 2:55:22.760]  They're really trying to attack him that way.
[2:55:22.760 --> 2:55:24.760]  So let's go ahead and play about a minute of this.
[2:55:24.760 --> 2:55:25.760]  Here it is.
[2:55:25.760 --> 2:55:29.760]  Last week, the Obama campaign released a 40-page manifesto criticizing the book.
[2:55:29.760 --> 2:55:33.760]  Joining us now to respond to these attacks is Jerome Corsi.
[2:55:33.760 --> 2:55:35.760]  I would propose that you've attacked Obama.
[2:55:35.760 --> 2:55:37.760]  You started the attacks.
[2:55:37.760 --> 2:55:40.760]  Here is some of the stuff that Obama has talked about.
[2:55:40.760 --> 2:55:41.760]  Sure.
[2:55:41.760 --> 2:55:43.760]  And some of the things that we've already covered a lot of this in your book.
[2:55:43.760 --> 2:55:45.760]  We've gone through some of the crazy things you've said.
[2:55:45.760 --> 2:55:46.760]  Right.
[2:55:46.760 --> 2:55:47.760]  That's all past.
[2:55:47.760 --> 2:55:49.760]  But some of the things you've said, for example, about John McCain.
[2:55:49.760 --> 2:55:52.760]  John McCain assumes a GOP frontrunner mantle.
[2:55:52.760 --> 2:55:56.760]  His little nose association with donors like George Soros and Theresa Hines carry.
[2:55:56.760 --> 2:55:58.760]  We're not talking about McCain tonight.
[2:55:58.760 --> 2:55:59.760]  Yes, I am.
[2:55:59.760 --> 2:56:00.760]  I'm talking about something.
[2:56:00.760 --> 2:56:01.760]  Well, that's good.
[2:56:01.760 --> 2:56:03.760]  But Alan, you know, I've got a bunch of friends who are emailing me saying,
[2:56:03.760 --> 2:56:06.760]  is there any way that I can get Senator Obama to attack their book?
[2:56:06.760 --> 2:56:10.760]  But you also said John McCain's personal fortune traces back to organized crime in America.
[2:56:10.760 --> 2:56:12.760]  You've really gone after John McCain?
[2:56:12.760 --> 2:56:14.760]  Look, I'm not voting for John McCain.
[2:56:14.760 --> 2:56:15.760]  I've attacked George W. Bush.
[2:56:15.760 --> 2:56:17.760]  Look at my last book, The Lake Rate USA.
[2:56:17.760 --> 2:56:19.760]  It became a New York Times bestseller, too.
[2:56:19.760 --> 2:56:22.760]  And, you know, Alan, I'm going to vote for Chuck Baldwin, the Constitution Party.
[2:56:22.760 --> 2:56:23.760]  I see.
[2:56:23.760 --> 2:56:29.760]  I wrote this book that I think the most dangerous candidate running so far left is Barack Obama.
[2:56:29.760 --> 2:56:32.760]  The Obama people have all pointed out some of the other things you've done.
[2:56:32.760 --> 2:56:35.760]  For example, you had a project that you were planning for January to expose what you call
[2:56:35.760 --> 2:56:38.760]  the government's analytical explanations about 9-11 attacks.
[2:56:38.760 --> 2:56:41.760]  Well, you know, Alan, they should have researched more of that article.
[2:56:41.760 --> 2:56:42.760]  It never got published.
[2:56:42.760 --> 2:56:45.760]  Well, but they never published it, but you wrote it.
[2:56:45.760 --> 2:56:49.760]  No, no, I wish if they had researched it, I withdrew the article because I was not convinced
[2:56:49.760 --> 2:56:50.760]  on the evidence.
[2:56:50.760 --> 2:56:51.760]  And you were on Alex Jones' show.
[2:56:51.760 --> 2:56:52.760]  You were discussing the findings of Stephen.
[2:56:52.760 --> 2:56:53.760]  Well, that's real physical.
[2:56:53.760 --> 2:56:54.760]  I didn't publish it.
[2:56:54.760 --> 2:56:55.760]  Let me just get the question off again.
[2:56:55.760 --> 2:56:56.760]  Sure.
[2:56:56.760 --> 2:56:57.760]  Go ahead, Alan.
[2:56:57.760 --> 2:56:59.760]  Of course, he's considered a hero of the 9-11 truth movement, and you were defending his
[2:56:59.760 --> 2:57:03.760]  claim that there was evidence the World Trade Center collapsed because of explosives inside
[2:57:03.760 --> 2:57:04.760]  the building.
[2:57:04.760 --> 2:57:05.760]  We didn't publish it, Alan.
[2:57:05.760 --> 2:57:06.760]  We would.
[2:57:06.760 --> 2:57:07.760]  But that's your belief, right?
[2:57:07.760 --> 2:57:08.760]  No, I withdrew the article.
[2:57:08.760 --> 2:57:12.760]  I published instead an article which they didn't, the Obama camp didn't find validating
[2:57:12.760 --> 2:57:13.760]  the findings.
[2:57:13.760 --> 2:57:18.760]  But look at what you said on Alex Jones' show, which is on tape, defending that position.
[2:57:18.760 --> 2:57:19.760]  Well, I investigated a lot of issues.
[2:57:19.760 --> 2:57:20.760]  I withdrew it.
[2:57:20.760 --> 2:57:21.760]  It never got published.
[2:57:21.760 --> 2:57:24.000]  Alex was interviewing me in the middle of research.
[2:57:24.000 --> 2:57:28.160]  And by the way, Alan, that research would not have supported this whole crazy idea that
[2:57:28.160 --> 2:57:29.840]  the government caused 9-11.
[2:57:29.840 --> 2:57:33.280]  It might have said that there was some evidence yet to look at and some questions to raise.
[2:57:33.280 --> 2:57:34.280]  You've also...
[2:57:34.280 --> 2:57:35.280]  I've never published anything in support of 9-11.
[2:57:35.280 --> 2:57:36.600]  But you said it on the Alex Jones show.
[2:57:36.600 --> 2:57:37.600]  You've also...
[2:57:37.600 --> 2:57:38.600]  You're misinterpreting that.
[2:57:38.600 --> 2:57:42.160]  I said I was looking at the evidence, Alan, and we didn't publish it.
[2:57:42.160 --> 2:57:45.440]  We were defending what Alex didn't publish it.
[2:57:45.440 --> 2:57:50.840]  Now I'm like Pastor Wright or something, but on Corsi.
[2:57:50.840 --> 2:57:51.840]  And it goes on and on.
[2:57:51.840 --> 2:57:52.840]  We'll play more of it later.
[2:57:52.840 --> 2:57:57.320]  We have an anthrax expert coming up with really bombshell info.
[2:57:57.320 --> 2:57:59.760]  I want to say bottom mark dice.
[2:57:59.760 --> 2:58:04.200]  We also have the reporter, Shane Geiger, Info Wars reporter, that really did a great job
[2:58:04.200 --> 2:58:06.400]  confronting this report today.
[2:58:06.400 --> 2:58:07.680]  It's all coming up.
[2:58:07.680 --> 2:58:08.680]  Stay with us.
[2:58:08.680 --> 2:58:12.400]  You are listening to GCN.
[2:58:12.400 --> 2:58:15.200]  All right, let's keep rolling.
[2:58:15.200 --> 2:58:16.840]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[2:58:16.840 --> 2:58:17.840]  Yeah, let's keep rolling.
[2:58:17.840 --> 2:58:20.880]  I want to talk to Dice now.
[2:58:20.880 --> 2:58:24.200]  Let me talk to Mark right now.
[2:58:24.200 --> 2:58:25.200]  Thanks.
[2:58:25.200 --> 2:58:26.200]  Hey, Mark.
[2:58:26.200 --> 2:58:27.200]  Yeah.
[2:58:27.200 --> 2:58:30.680]  Yeah, we're still on air right now at PrismPlanet.tv to let you know we're back live with a full
[2:58:30.680 --> 2:58:32.960]  AM and FM audience in one minute.
[2:58:32.960 --> 2:58:37.600]  Yeah, let me just get you on, not next week as I'm out of town, but the week after.
[2:58:37.600 --> 2:58:40.960]  And I do want to carry the resistance manifesto.
[2:58:40.960 --> 2:58:43.040]  Your first one was great, but this one's even better.
[2:58:43.040 --> 2:58:46.240]  So I need to talk to you about that today to get that nailed down, but just go ahead
[2:58:46.240 --> 2:58:50.000]  and mail me 200 of these bad boys.
[2:58:50.000 --> 2:58:52.280]  And I just want to really thank you for all you've done.
[2:58:52.280 --> 2:58:58.280]  I want you to come back and, you know, briefly comment on the 9-11 situation with Bermas.
[2:58:58.280 --> 2:59:03.080]  Then I want to get this other reporter up, Shane Geiger, who got into the NIST folks,
[2:59:03.080 --> 2:59:11.080]  and then make sure, John, that Trey has called Professor Boyle to move him to about 15 after.
[2:59:11.080 --> 2:59:12.080]  Okay.
[2:59:12.080 --> 2:59:13.080]  All right.
[2:59:13.080 --> 2:59:14.080]  Here we go, folks.
[2:59:14.080 --> 2:59:15.760]  Total transparency behind the scenes.
[2:59:15.760 --> 2:59:21.360]  We're coming back live with Bermie, Mark Dice, and of course, Shane Geiger.
[2:59:21.360 --> 2:59:22.760]  Stay with us.
[2:59:22.760 --> 2:59:39.440]  Watching War on Corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:59:39.440 --> 2:59:41.440]  Get ready for real talk radio.
[2:59:41.440 --> 2:59:47.320]  That's what this radio transmission has always been about, truly the original name of this
[2:59:47.320 --> 2:59:48.320]  radio show.
[2:59:48.320 --> 2:59:50.320]  It's also been called the final edition.
[2:59:50.320 --> 2:59:53.600]  Yeah, when I would do the last live show at a local station.
[2:59:53.600 --> 2:59:54.600]  Okay.
[2:59:54.600 --> 2:59:55.600]  We got Mark Dice with us.
[2:59:55.600 --> 2:59:56.600]  This is Van Festo.
[2:59:56.600 --> 2:59:57.600]  We're going to have him back on.
[2:59:57.600 --> 3:00:00.400]  Get it at markdice.com.
[3:00:00.400 --> 3:00:02.000]  I want to shift into 9-11.
[3:00:02.000 --> 3:00:07.320]  Bermas, what do you think of Mr. Corsi and what do you think Mark Dice, what we just
[3:00:07.320 --> 3:00:08.320]  heard with him?
[3:00:08.320 --> 3:00:09.800]  It's throwing me under the bus.
[3:00:09.800 --> 3:00:14.600]  Oh, he's definitely throwing you under the bus a wee bit, but also, you know, I think
[3:00:14.600 --> 3:00:16.000]  Combs is throwing you under the bus.
[3:00:16.000 --> 3:00:19.280]  He also was contacted by you, has been on the show.
[3:00:19.280 --> 3:00:22.880]  And you know, he's the little Democratic cheerleader there, they're a little sigh up on that end
[3:00:22.880 --> 3:00:24.280]  of the spectrum.
[3:00:24.280 --> 3:00:28.480]  And he just loves to use you to discredit people when in fact, Corsi a couple of times
[3:00:28.480 --> 3:00:31.320]  just try to say, look, I'm looking at the physicist's evidence.
[3:00:31.320 --> 3:00:35.360]  And of course he did have to back paddle and say, maybe there were some unanswered questions,
[3:00:35.360 --> 3:00:38.760]  but I'm saying that, you know, there's no way that the government helped cause 9-11.
[3:00:38.760 --> 3:00:43.520]  And by the way, Corsi says his publisher will quote, not let him come on the show when he's
[3:00:43.520 --> 3:00:44.520]  under contract.
[3:00:44.520 --> 3:00:47.920]  Well, I mean, you got snubbed on Geraldo the other day and other Fox news.
[3:00:47.920 --> 3:00:50.800]  Yeah, they drove me down there, had me sit there, well, that's why I've always refused
[3:00:50.800 --> 3:00:51.800]  to fly there.
[3:00:51.800 --> 3:00:55.600]  They're always trying to get me to fly to New York like it's some Murdoch joke.
[3:00:55.600 --> 3:00:58.960]  And the last guy I sent up there, the plane almost crashed, was like dropping 2000 feet
[3:00:58.960 --> 3:00:59.960]  in thunderstorms.
[3:00:59.960 --> 3:01:01.480]  And I'm sure that's a coincidence.
[3:01:01.480 --> 3:01:02.480]  Of course it is.
[3:01:02.480 --> 3:01:03.480]  Yeah.
[3:01:03.480 --> 3:01:06.160]  You've probably got some new old-order person down there on the witches hat and the thing
[3:01:06.160 --> 3:01:10.240]  like, ah, Saruman, that'll get you, Jones.
[3:01:10.240 --> 3:01:11.640]  Anyways, it's crazy.
[3:01:11.640 --> 3:01:13.120]  Mark Dice, final comments.
[3:01:13.120 --> 3:01:17.360]  I want to announce, and I'll do this when I'm back on your show in a couple of weeks
[3:01:17.360 --> 3:01:20.680]  for, you know, 9-11, the anniversary is coming up here in about three weeks, and for those
[3:01:20.680 --> 3:01:24.720]  who can't make it to New York or who can't go out to a local rally or who just want to
[3:01:24.720 --> 3:01:29.160]  get involved but don't know what to do, I want to just announce Operation Phone Mob.
[3:01:29.160 --> 3:01:35.040]  So I think on 9-11, it's a Thursday, details will be posted at markdice.com, I'll email
[3:01:35.040 --> 3:01:36.040]  that out to everybody.
[3:01:36.040 --> 3:01:39.680]  I think that we need to get hundreds of people to call into the radio talk shows on that
[3:01:39.680 --> 3:01:44.840]  day and let's get every single phone call to be one of us.
[3:01:44.840 --> 3:01:45.840]  Let's address the issues.
[3:01:45.840 --> 3:01:47.600]  And what do you think of Corsi?
[3:01:47.600 --> 3:01:49.800]  I mean, this is becoming a big issue.
[3:01:49.800 --> 3:01:54.120]  You know, there was some cross talk there between him and Colm, but he said, I don't
[3:01:54.120 --> 3:01:57.800]  know if people made it out that he said he's never written anything in support of the 9-11
[3:01:57.800 --> 3:02:04.200]  Truth Movement, so he's in a rough position, but again, he's got a lot of responsibility.
[3:02:04.200 --> 3:02:05.200]  He probably knows the truth.
[3:02:05.200 --> 3:02:11.680]  Yeah, he's the darling of the hardcore neocons, and then he's saying, he's looking at Evans
[3:02:11.680 --> 3:02:16.160]  of Inside Job, and they're saying he's delusional about the North American Union.
[3:02:16.160 --> 3:02:17.160]  You know what it is?
[3:02:17.160 --> 3:02:21.400]  It's almost like when Ron Paul was initially interviewed by student scholars, and he said
[3:02:21.400 --> 3:02:25.080]  he would support a new investigation, although he didn't believe that it would really tell
[3:02:25.080 --> 3:02:28.920]  the truth, and then he'd even have to backpedal from that position when he got bigger.
[3:02:28.920 --> 3:02:32.480]  Well, of course, he was able to come on your show, talk about thermite, but now that he's
[3:02:32.480 --> 3:02:36.480]  a New York Times number one bestseller, and he's on all these shows, it's time to back
[3:02:36.480 --> 3:02:40.120]  off a bit, because 9-11 Truth is just still too hot for some people.
[3:02:40.120 --> 3:02:43.960]  Oh yeah, they all know, they all know every single one of them.
[3:02:43.960 --> 3:02:47.280]  His book's already a bestseller at this point, I think he has nothing to lose.
[3:02:47.280 --> 3:02:51.400]  He should just come out hard-hitting and just state the facts.
[3:02:51.400 --> 3:02:55.800]  You know, I understand that his publisher's trying to backpedal and protect their financial
[3:02:55.800 --> 3:02:56.800]  neck.
[3:02:56.800 --> 3:03:00.400]  I mean, he's always asking to come on the show, because he knows my audience with a
[3:03:00.400 --> 3:03:04.120]  few other shows can push it up the New York Times bestseller list, and I think his book's
[3:03:04.120 --> 3:03:06.600]  important, and you know, he's being attacked or saying it's disinfo.
[3:03:06.600 --> 3:03:12.160]  No, they're not attacking him on the book itself, they're attacking him on North American
[3:03:12.160 --> 3:03:16.360]  Union or 9-11, and so that's another issue.
[3:03:16.360 --> 3:03:20.720]  Why aren't they attacking him on the issues the book covers, Bermie?
[3:03:20.720 --> 3:03:24.680]  Well, I mean, they got some of my new errors in there, and they blow them out of proportion
[3:03:24.680 --> 3:03:28.320]  for the book, but like you said, they don't want to address the main stuff.
[3:03:28.320 --> 3:03:33.160]  I mean, he does get in the SPP right after the discussion about you on Hannity and Combs,
[3:03:33.160 --> 3:03:35.400]  you know, securities and prosperity's partnership.
[3:03:35.400 --> 3:03:39.520]  So the guy's obviously very, very smart, he's very, very hip to what this movement's doing.
[3:03:39.520 --> 3:03:44.100]  I do hope he comes out a little stronger for 9-11 Truth, I don't expect it.
[3:03:44.100 --> 3:03:48.040]  His words can't be taken back, that interview with you is monumental, and should be played
[3:03:48.040 --> 3:03:49.040]  all over the place.
[3:03:49.040 --> 3:03:53.560]  I mean, let's be honest, without 9-11 Truth, we're never going to take this country back.
[3:03:53.560 --> 3:03:54.560]  They're going to keep staging more.
[3:03:54.560 --> 3:03:57.400]  Yeah, and he can vote for Chuck Baldwin all he wants.
[3:03:57.400 --> 3:04:01.160]  It's not going to help us, and Chuck Baldwin isn't admitted 9-11 Truth, or he knows all
[3:04:01.160 --> 3:04:03.280]  about the New World Order, so by the support of...
[3:04:03.280 --> 3:04:05.640]  That's a nexus point.
[3:04:05.640 --> 3:04:06.640]  Yeah, of course.
[3:04:06.640 --> 3:04:07.640]  Let's just go ahead and do it.
[3:04:07.640 --> 3:04:10.640]  Dr. Corsi denies 9-11 Truth, but supports 9-11 Truth Canada.
[3:04:10.640 --> 3:04:13.360]  Hey, Mark Dice, thanks for coming on with us.
[3:04:13.360 --> 3:04:14.360]  No problem.
[3:04:14.360 --> 3:04:15.360]  Good to have you.
[3:04:15.360 --> 3:04:16.880]  We'll have you back up in two weeks, we're going to have...
[3:04:16.880 --> 3:04:18.560]  There he goes, great guy.
[3:04:18.560 --> 3:04:23.720]  Mark Dice, resistancemanifesto.com, markdice.com, my website's infowars.com, Burma's, this is
[3:04:23.720 --> 3:04:24.720]  Burmy.com.
[3:04:24.720 --> 3:04:28.320]  We'll be right back with Derek and the whole crew.
[3:04:28.320 --> 3:04:29.320]  Stay with us.
[3:04:29.320 --> 3:04:30.320]  Oh, and we have a reporter.
[3:04:30.320 --> 3:04:34.160]  It's going to be, unlike any other, in the long course of American history, a terrorist
[3:04:34.160 --> 3:04:36.840]  act of war against this country.
[3:04:36.840 --> 3:04:38.840]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[3:04:38.840 --> 3:04:39.840]  Burmy.com, who is the enemy?
[3:04:39.840 --> 3:04:40.840]  Someone's probably going to go grab it.
[3:04:40.840 --> 3:04:41.840]  Bin Laden.
[3:04:41.840 --> 3:04:42.840]  These are his MOs.
[3:04:42.840 --> 3:04:43.840]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[3:04:43.840 --> 3:04:45.840]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[3:04:45.840 --> 3:04:50.840]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[3:04:50.840 --> 3:04:53.440]  networks inside the United States.
[3:04:53.440 --> 3:04:57.320]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis, again, very much engaged in
[3:04:57.320 --> 3:05:00.080]  spying in and on the U.S.
[3:05:00.080 --> 3:05:03.800]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[3:05:03.800 --> 3:05:09.240]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[3:05:09.240 --> 3:05:13.400]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much,
[3:05:13.400 --> 3:05:14.400]  much more.
[3:05:14.400 --> 3:05:15.400]  Fabled Enemies.

[3:07:10.440 --> 3:07:11.600]  and insomnia.

[3:07:36.640 --> 3:07:40.120]  We have Professor Francis A. Boyle joining us in about five minutes.
[3:07:40.120 --> 3:07:44.880]  By the way, I'm on in Toronto tonight for an hour with Richard Serra, I'm gonna plug
[3:07:44.880 --> 3:07:46.880]  that for the listeners, I wanna hear that.
[3:07:46.880 --> 3:07:51.800]  Francis Boyle with huge anthrax news in T-minus five minutes, finishing up with Jason Burmus.
[3:07:51.800 --> 3:07:54.880]  There's new film Fabled Enemies coming out in 10 days.
[3:07:54.880 --> 3:08:00.800]  See it at prisonplanet.tv first, pre-order the DVD now, ship sound September 1st.
[3:08:00.800 --> 3:08:05.920]  Going to Shane Geiger, I appreciate holding, Shane just popped by and said, can I say I'm
[3:08:05.920 --> 3:08:07.520]  an info wars freelance reporter?
[3:08:07.520 --> 3:08:11.560]  We said sure, they called and checked with NIST that he really was going.
[3:08:11.560 --> 3:08:15.400]  They had their little meeting, he got his question out and they shut him down.
[3:08:15.400 --> 3:08:21.600]  So just giving some background, Shane Geiger, tell listeners what happened, where this was,
[3:08:21.600 --> 3:08:23.800]  how you got the question in and what happened.
[3:08:23.800 --> 3:08:27.080]  Hi Alex, thanks so much for having me on the show.
[3:08:27.080 --> 3:08:28.080]  Oh thank you.
[3:08:28.080 --> 3:08:30.280]  Yeah, it's a pleasure.
[3:08:30.280 --> 3:08:39.040]  I was basically making some statements that were backed up, I mean this is fact, I was
[3:08:39.040 --> 3:08:45.440]  just stating what had been in the Twin Towers report, and then I stated some things about
[3:08:45.440 --> 3:08:53.080]  the back and forth between the Stephen Jones camp and NIST, Stephen Jones did a data quality
[3:08:53.080 --> 3:09:00.120]  assurance act request and NIST replied back in September of 2007 stating that they are
[3:09:00.120 --> 3:09:06.800]  unable to provide a full explanation of the total collapse, and they also stated that
[3:09:06.800 --> 3:09:10.640]  they did not conduct tests for explosive residues.
[3:09:10.640 --> 3:09:17.800]  Yeah, they won't do mathematic equations, they'll just show us video computer composites
[3:09:17.800 --> 3:09:22.480]  that any 14 year old with a case of hot pockets and jolt cola could make.
[3:09:22.480 --> 3:09:27.600]  Right, so this should sound very familiar to NIST because they were involved in the
[3:09:27.600 --> 3:09:35.200]  back and forth, and yet this was at the point in my questioning where I was basically shut
[3:09:35.200 --> 3:09:40.400]  down, and I had a few other things, I tried to get out after that, I'm very interested
[3:09:40.400 --> 3:09:49.080]  in the scientific method being applied to the research of all the 9-11 truthers and
[3:09:49.080 --> 3:09:51.080]  you know the other people who are looking at the results.
[3:09:51.080 --> 3:09:55.160]  Well describe where this was, how you were able to get to sound, I mean tell us the locale,
[3:09:55.160 --> 3:09:58.760]  tell us what it was like, tell us, you were there.
[3:09:58.760 --> 3:10:06.320]  Yeah we were in this 11 story nondescript building on the NIST campus, I'm glad it didn't
[3:10:06.320 --> 3:10:09.560]  collapse on us, it probably would have collapsed in about 2 or 3 seconds.
[3:10:09.560 --> 3:10:12.760]  Well if somebody would have put a big lighter up against it, it would have jumped a steel
[3:10:12.760 --> 3:10:15.480]  column, it would have just been perfect.
[3:10:15.480 --> 3:10:21.840]  Yeah well it was just kind of surreal, I was there among reporters from the AP, New York
[3:10:21.840 --> 3:10:30.360]  Times, Fox, the ZDF, which is the second station in Germany, I was actually talking
[3:10:30.360 --> 3:10:37.440]  after the event with somebody who's involved in the making of the third tower, so he's
[3:10:37.440 --> 3:10:43.600]  working with Mike Rudin of the BBC, so I got a lot of, it was really great to get some
[3:10:43.600 --> 3:10:49.440]  media contacts, thanks so much for that Alex, and I was just, I was surrounded by all these
[3:10:49.440 --> 3:10:59.360]  people who obviously have an axe to grind, these people were sort of in a standoffish
[3:10:59.360 --> 3:11:05.440]  and it was not really a friendly environment, in fact I think it was somewhat telling that
[3:11:05.440 --> 3:11:12.840]  as soon as I started calling NIST on these bare assertions, the lights actually went
[3:11:12.840 --> 3:11:18.800]  out in the room, so it was a little unfriendly from that second on.
[3:11:18.800 --> 3:11:19.800]  Oh.
[3:11:19.800 --> 3:11:24.760]  And the microphone started moving away from me as I was, you know, this was just totally
[3:11:24.760 --> 3:11:30.240]  ridiculous, you know, I travel halfway across the country to ask questions and I have to
[3:11:30.240 --> 3:11:36.400]  show up under the pretext of being a reporter when it's not enough to be a concerned U.S.
[3:11:36.400 --> 3:11:37.880]  citizen to show up here.
[3:11:37.880 --> 3:11:42.120]  Well you are an info wars reporter and you did a great job, now Bermas, you've been analyzing
[3:11:42.120 --> 3:11:45.400]  this, you've seen what happened, they're also backing away from their lives, we have the
[3:11:45.400 --> 3:11:49.040]  video, the front of the building has some windows knocked out, but they say in their
[3:11:49.040 --> 3:11:52.680]  report, a third of the building knocked out in the front, that's the south face actually,
[3:11:52.680 --> 3:11:56.480]  the south face of the building and we have the videos where there's a few windows blown
[3:11:56.480 --> 3:12:00.160]  out but we obviously see the guy walk into the building and then go up the escalator
[3:12:00.160 --> 3:12:03.840]  into the main lobby, so there's not, well I believe what they said was a quarter of
[3:12:03.840 --> 3:12:07.400]  the building or somewhere between 10 and 12 stories scooped out of the building while
[3:12:07.400 --> 3:12:12.360]  their new model has no scoop out and they don't even claim, oh so no new lines for old,
[3:12:12.360 --> 3:12:16.880]  yeah yeah, there's no scoop out, they don't even mention the quote on quote scoop out
[3:12:16.880 --> 3:12:18.880]  so they've retracted that statement.
[3:12:18.880 --> 3:12:23.160]  Now they're also saying it wasn't the fuel oil tanks and they're also saying, it's unbelievable
[3:12:23.160 --> 3:12:27.400]  what this actually comes to, well they're saying that although no other building has
[3:12:27.400 --> 3:12:32.840]  even come close to this kind of structural damage I guess from hundreds of degrees less
[3:12:32.840 --> 3:12:37.840]  than known fires, that's what they did, it was the thermal expansion of columns located
[3:12:37.840 --> 3:12:41.920]  near the center of the building, they're also claiming that that's why the rooftop,
[3:12:41.920 --> 3:12:45.920]  the line falls first, okay and then they say the facade falls with it.
[3:12:45.920 --> 3:12:51.040]  Now they say in the very beginning that they did test for explosives but later in the press
[3:12:51.040 --> 3:12:56.840]  conference they backtrack and Shane I believe is the one that talked about this, they backtracked
[3:12:56.840 --> 3:13:01.080]  and said, oh well we never even considered thermite, it's just such a ludicrous hypothesis
[3:13:01.080 --> 3:13:02.560]  that we never tested for it.
[3:13:02.560 --> 3:13:06.880]  Of course, then this guys all happen to be top experts in explosive thermite when no
[3:13:06.880 --> 3:13:10.480]  one else is, just so happens they're top experts.
[3:13:10.480 --> 3:13:15.160]  Yeah and you know the molten metal is never addressed, it's not addressed in this and
[3:13:15.160 --> 3:13:20.440]  now they're making it into a standards issue and saying that skyscrapers need to re-evaluate
[3:13:20.440 --> 3:13:25.560]  how they've been built, it's a total lie, plus this thing had a special bunker built
[3:13:25.560 --> 3:13:29.720]  inside of it to withstand nuclear attacks but magically you put a big lighter to it
[3:13:29.720 --> 3:13:30.720]  and it just can blabber.
[3:13:30.720 --> 3:13:36.080]  You know what's really upsetting is that again, this was New York's number one spook house
[3:13:36.080 --> 3:13:41.800]  located in the center of Manhattan, largest CIA base outside of Langley, Virginia, FBI,
[3:13:41.800 --> 3:13:46.640]  largest secret service office in the world, armored bunker and the office of emergency
[3:13:46.640 --> 3:13:47.640]  management.
[3:13:47.640 --> 3:13:49.920]  But now the building has a small fire, it's falling, I mean it's over.
[3:13:49.920 --> 3:13:54.080]  Well the office of emergency management was also hooked into the Pentagon 24-7, we show
[3:13:54.080 --> 3:13:58.840]  that in fabled enemies and it had blueprints of every single building in New York City
[3:13:58.840 --> 3:14:03.880]  and in fabled enemies we show you how immediately after the building collapsed the FBI set up
[3:14:03.880 --> 3:14:09.120]  teams with binoculars watching the rescue workers to make sure they didn't take anything
[3:14:09.120 --> 3:14:11.080]  out of that building that was incriminating.
[3:14:11.080 --> 3:14:15.560]  Now Jason, I want you to set up Info Wars reporter Shane Giger for 30 minutes tomorrow,
[3:14:15.560 --> 3:14:17.320]  you're sitting in for me as I get ready to go to Denver.
[3:14:17.320 --> 3:14:22.000]  We need to go to Professor Francis A. Boyle here in just a moment, do we have him?
[3:14:22.000 --> 3:14:23.520]  Yes, he's all set.
[3:14:23.520 --> 3:14:26.800]  Okay, good, I don't want to make him hold anymore, we just got overbooked today and his
[3:14:26.800 --> 3:14:28.200]  information is so important.
[3:14:28.200 --> 3:14:32.200]  Shane, let me set you up because you went to the census report for 30 minutes tomorrow
[3:14:32.200 --> 3:14:38.480]  at least with Jason, so let me have Trey and Jason right now call you and get that set
[3:14:38.480 --> 3:14:39.480]  up.
[3:14:39.480 --> 3:14:40.480]  Thank you Jason Bermas for that information.
[3:14:40.480 --> 3:14:41.480]  Thank you.
[3:14:41.480 --> 3:14:45.800]  All right, this is very, very serious issue, ladies and gentlemen I apologize, I was screwing
[3:14:45.800 --> 3:14:49.240]  around earlier here in the studio but Jason's about to leave town and been with us for five
[3:14:49.240 --> 3:14:53.000]  months so we're just having some fun, very, very dark times, very, very serious things
[3:14:53.000 --> 3:14:55.400]  that we are dealing with here.
[3:14:55.400 --> 3:14:57.680]  Thank you, Shane Giger, we'll talk to you tomorrow.
[3:14:57.680 --> 3:14:59.680]  It was a pleasure, Alex.
[3:14:59.680 --> 3:15:02.680]  Very bad, thank you, you can go through it all tomorrow with people.
[3:15:02.680 --> 3:15:05.920]  Okay, for the next 45 minutes I am very honored, we're going to skip a few of the breaks for
[3:15:05.920 --> 3:15:09.960]  PrisonPlanet.tv viewers and infoawards.com stream listeners because this is too important
[3:15:09.960 --> 3:15:12.760]  information and the time we have left.
[3:15:12.760 --> 3:15:18.240]  If I went over Professor Boyle's bio it would take hours but he's written international
[3:15:18.240 --> 3:15:22.960]  weapons, bio weapons conventions, he's been a top level analyst for the federal government
[3:15:22.960 --> 3:15:25.200]  in that capacity.
[3:15:25.200 --> 3:15:31.520]  He just goes on and on with his lengthy bio and last time he was on with us I guess about
[3:15:31.520 --> 3:15:35.560]  a year and a half ago an article that Steve Watson wrote about it was published in scores
[3:15:35.560 --> 3:15:39.920]  of newspapers and one of the largest magazines in the country and some foreign newspapers
[3:15:39.920 --> 3:15:44.560]  as well dealing with the fact that he was saying the anthrax was an inside job.
[3:15:44.560 --> 3:15:48.120]  Now I've got my mother-in-law that doesn't even believe my show calling up thinking the
[3:15:48.120 --> 3:15:51.440]  government did it, should we put on the list now I'm sure.
[3:15:51.440 --> 3:15:56.640]  Now I've got just all over everyone saying it's complete bull, mainstream media saying
[3:15:56.640 --> 3:16:00.600]  it's complete bull, you look at the whole story, they grabbed this other Patsy, put
[3:16:00.600 --> 3:16:04.760]  him in the hospital murdering clearly, then say that he was always who they knew did it
[3:16:04.760 --> 3:16:09.200]  while they persecuted Stephen Hadfield, we have this other guy Dr. Phillip Zack breaking
[3:16:09.200 --> 3:16:13.560]  in to the bio weapons lab when he didn't even work there not getting in trouble, still at
[3:16:13.560 --> 3:16:18.600]  another bio weapons lab, it's the most weaponized US anthrax ever seen, the FBI destroys the
[3:16:18.600 --> 3:16:25.480]  original samples so that they can't be proven and so they can claim that this Dr. Ivan's
[3:16:25.480 --> 3:16:30.440]  cooked it up in his bathtub or in a basement, just the miniaturization process takes over
[3:16:30.440 --> 3:16:35.320]  $100 million worth of equipment, it's the size of a gymnasium, it just goes on and on
[3:16:35.320 --> 3:16:38.840]  but we have a bio weapons expert on with us, sure I know you don't like talking about
[3:16:38.840 --> 3:16:43.320]  yourself but we're about to break, give us some of your background though and your expertise
[3:16:43.320 --> 3:16:48.080]  on this and your bold stance a year and a half ago that's now being echoed by people
[3:16:48.080 --> 3:16:52.520]  at Fort Dietrich saying Ivan's couldn't have done this and you know as the plot really
[3:16:52.520 --> 3:16:55.720]  thickens and as their cover up implodes.
[3:16:55.720 --> 3:17:04.720]  Right, well the day the technology on the dashel letter was revealed in the New York
[3:17:04.720 --> 3:17:13.800]  Times, I immediately called Marion Spike Bowman who is a high level counterintelligence official
[3:17:13.800 --> 3:17:22.640]  at the FBI and in fact it turns out was also the person who spiked the FBI's warrant for
[3:17:22.640 --> 3:17:27.880]  the Masawi computer but that's another issue.
[3:17:27.880 --> 3:17:30.560]  But before we go tell folks who you are.
[3:17:30.560 --> 3:17:39.680]  Well I, I'm getting to that, he knew me because I had drafted the United States biological
[3:17:39.680 --> 3:17:48.400]  weapons anti-terrorism act of 1989 that was passed unanimously by both houses of the United
[3:17:48.400 --> 3:17:54.200]  States Congress and signed into law by President Bush Sr.
[3:17:54.200 --> 3:18:01.600]  That legislation was the U.S. domestic implementing legislation for the Biological Weapons Convention
[3:18:01.600 --> 3:18:08.720]  and Mr. Bowman and I had met each other at a terrorism conference at the University of
[3:18:08.720 --> 3:18:12.120]  Michigan Law School.
[3:18:12.120 --> 3:18:21.240]  In any event, I told Mr. Bowman, this was in October of 2001 that the only people who
[3:18:21.240 --> 3:18:30.000]  had the capability to do this would be those individuals working at either United States
[3:18:30.000 --> 3:18:39.760]  government labs or private contractors and things of this nature and that it obviously
[3:18:39.760 --> 3:18:46.320]  seemed to me this was U.S. government related.
[3:18:46.320 --> 3:18:55.080]  He took the information down and said he would pass it on to the appropriate people handling
[3:18:55.080 --> 3:18:57.720]  the investigation I hung up.
[3:18:57.720 --> 3:19:03.360]  And then it occurred to me that I had a complete list of who all these people were and what
[3:19:03.360 --> 3:19:09.400]  these labs were going back to my work on the, getting the legislation through.
[3:19:09.400 --> 3:19:10.400]  Absolutely.
[3:19:10.400 --> 3:19:15.080]  We're gonna, we're gonna skip this break for stations out there and then just come right
[3:19:15.080 --> 3:19:20.880]  back in to the main segment in four minutes with our guest, a really top bioweapons expert
[3:19:20.880 --> 3:19:23.920]  helped write some of the major international treaties for the United States.
[3:19:23.920 --> 3:19:28.440]  Francis A. Boyle and we are continuing skipping this break.
[3:19:28.440 --> 3:19:31.880]  Okay, Mr. Boyle, continue.
[3:19:31.880 --> 3:19:33.600]  Oh, sure.
[3:19:33.600 --> 3:19:41.800]  So I called him back and I said, you know, I have a complete list here of when the program
[3:19:41.800 --> 3:19:49.640]  was in the public record and here's some of the names and some of the facilities and I
[3:19:49.640 --> 3:19:53.880]  went through, not all of it, but I went, you know, I went down the list.
[3:19:53.880 --> 3:19:58.600]  And I told him where he could get this list.
[3:19:58.600 --> 3:20:05.560]  And then I said, and it's also been reported this summer that the CIA was engaged in anthrax
[3:20:05.560 --> 3:20:07.680]  work as well.
[3:20:07.680 --> 3:20:13.360]  You could get the CIA list from the, from the CIA.
[3:20:13.360 --> 3:20:19.400]  And then, you know, we talked some more and he said, well, he, you know, the FBI was,
[3:20:19.400 --> 3:20:21.760]  was working with Fort Detrick.
[3:20:21.760 --> 3:20:29.760]  And I said, well, Fort Detrick could very well be the problem here that you had someone
[3:20:29.760 --> 3:20:37.720]  like a Timothy McVeigh who was once on the reservation and now off the reservation.
[3:20:37.720 --> 3:20:43.120]  So he said again, he would communicate this to the people in charge of the investigation.
[3:20:43.120 --> 3:20:47.200]  Instead, they ran around everywhere saying that it was somebody in a bathtub or in a
[3:20:47.200 --> 3:20:52.520]  bucket making it, and, and, and, and now we know the White House ordered Robert Mueller
[3:20:52.520 --> 3:20:59.160]  to say it was Iraq, that it was al-Qaeda, and boy, that really shows them being complicit.
[3:20:59.160 --> 3:21:00.160]  But please continue.
[3:21:00.160 --> 3:21:06.280]  Well, it was even worse than that, Alex, in that at that point, you know, I had assumed
[3:21:06.280 --> 3:21:12.480]  good faith on the part of the FBI in this investigation because, you know, it had killed
[3:21:12.480 --> 3:21:13.480]  several people.
[3:21:13.480 --> 3:21:19.960]  It had shut down the United States Congress, which I think was probably the greatest political
[3:21:19.960 --> 3:21:26.280]  crime ever inflicted on our republic and in its history.
[3:21:26.280 --> 3:21:35.120]  But then I read that the FBI had authorized the destruction of the U.S. government's Ames
[3:21:35.120 --> 3:21:40.440]  Strain collection in Ames, Iowa.
[3:21:40.440 --> 3:21:48.080]  Ames Strain was the strain responsible for U.S. bio warfare programs.
[3:21:48.080 --> 3:21:50.080]  Everyone knew that.
[3:21:50.080 --> 3:21:52.240]  And indeed, that's all now been confirmed.
[3:21:52.240 --> 3:21:55.680]  You can read it in today's New York Times as a story right in there.
[3:21:55.680 --> 3:22:00.800]  And of course, we all said this six and a half years ago, but we're still cooks.
[3:22:00.800 --> 3:22:01.800]  Right.
[3:22:01.800 --> 3:22:09.920]  So when I read the FBI had destroyed the entire Ames Strain collection in Ames, Iowa,
[3:22:09.920 --> 3:22:16.920]  I knew a cover-up was underway because you could have taken the FBI, legitimate scientific
[3:22:16.920 --> 3:22:27.320]  researchers could have taken that collection and used it to genetically reconstruct precisely
[3:22:27.320 --> 3:22:34.480]  where and when and how the weapon came from.
[3:22:34.480 --> 3:22:36.480]  And they destroyed it.
[3:22:36.480 --> 3:22:43.000]  This was clearly a federal crime in its own right, destruction of justice.
[3:22:43.000 --> 3:22:48.040]  So it was obvious that evidence all should have been preserved as evidence of a crime.
[3:22:48.040 --> 3:22:50.400]  I used to teach criminal law here.
[3:22:50.400 --> 3:22:56.200]  So it was obvious they were covering up and covering up ever since.
[3:22:56.200 --> 3:23:02.440]  Indeed, if you read today's New York Times, they also come up with this statement.
[3:23:02.440 --> 3:23:11.680]  They admit that Ivan's submitted a culture to them, which they promptly destroyed.
[3:23:11.680 --> 3:23:18.720]  So there you have yet again another instance of destruction of evidence, obstruction of
[3:23:18.720 --> 3:23:20.720]  justice by the FBI.
[3:23:20.720 --> 3:23:27.640]  And as hurriedly as they could, okay, we're going to come back in with some stations joining
[3:23:27.640 --> 3:23:30.520]  us to continue right now with our guests.
[3:23:30.520 --> 3:23:48.320]  Francis Boyle is a professor of international law at the University of Illinois College of
[3:23:48.320 --> 3:23:49.320]  Law.
[3:23:49.320 --> 3:23:51.880]  He's a graduate of the University of Chicago and Harvard Law School.
[3:23:51.880 --> 3:23:57.240]  He's also received a PhD in political science from Harvard University.
[3:23:57.240 --> 3:24:04.480]  And he has just had a bio, it's too long to go over, but he's written international
[3:24:04.480 --> 3:24:09.720]  bio weapons conventions for the federal government, advised Congress, written some of the biggest
[3:24:09.720 --> 3:24:11.800]  publications out there.
[3:24:11.800 --> 3:24:15.240]  The list just goes on and on.
[3:24:15.240 --> 3:24:21.720]  He's currently a member of the Nobel Prize for Governor George H. Ryan committee.
[3:24:21.720 --> 3:24:28.160]  Okay, continuing, sir, with the FBI covering up this evidence, covering up the original
[3:24:28.160 --> 3:24:33.920]  aim, strain, destroying them, then they find other samples that other people had that they
[3:24:33.920 --> 3:24:34.920]  gave them.
[3:24:34.920 --> 3:24:35.920]  They destroy it immediately.
[3:24:35.920 --> 3:24:39.400]  You're saying crimes, obstruction of justice.
[3:24:39.400 --> 3:24:40.600]  Why are they covering it up?
[3:24:40.600 --> 3:24:44.240]  Well, then we have the White House on Cipro, the Anthrax fighting antibiotic.
[3:24:44.240 --> 3:24:47.640]  Weeks before the Anthrax letter show up admitting that arrogantly.
[3:24:47.640 --> 3:24:50.040]  We have political enemies of the Bushes getting it.
[3:24:50.040 --> 3:24:52.920]  They use it as a smokescreen to pass the Patriot Act.
[3:24:52.920 --> 3:24:58.040]  They're pressuring the FBI, now public, ordering them to say al-Qaeda, al-CIA did it.
[3:24:58.040 --> 3:25:03.240]  I mean, this is the most open and shut case ever for the federal government, criminal
[3:25:03.240 --> 3:25:05.480]  elements of it, launching the Anthrax attack.
[3:25:05.480 --> 3:25:09.680]  Then you have the cover up, the Patsy's, I mean, break that down for us.
[3:25:09.680 --> 3:25:12.640]  Yeah, I think it's all clear.
[3:25:12.640 --> 3:25:19.880]  On the first weekend in November, I went out to Harvard where I was running a workshop
[3:25:19.880 --> 3:25:28.560]  on biological weapons, and I publicly stated at the time that in my opinion, my professional
[3:25:28.560 --> 3:25:34.600]  opinion, it was either elements of the United States government itself or contractors working
[3:25:34.600 --> 3:25:40.400]  for the United States government that was behind the Anthrax attack, and my colleague
[3:25:40.400 --> 3:25:48.200]  at the time, Professor Jonathan King of MIT, who runs their, who's a microbiologist and
[3:25:48.200 --> 3:25:56.840]  runs their electron microscope lab, independently said the exact same thing I did.
[3:25:56.840 --> 3:26:04.560]  And I gave interviews on Fox and the BBC and Pacifica saying this, you know, the first
[3:26:04.560 --> 3:26:06.520]  week in November.
[3:26:06.520 --> 3:26:16.040]  So, it's been very clear, and the reason is that for the FBI cover up, it would lead
[3:26:16.040 --> 3:26:26.880]  back to a secret covert illegal and criminal offensive biological weapons program involving
[3:26:26.880 --> 3:26:33.160]  Anthrax, and I say it's criminal because I was the person who drafted the statute making
[3:26:33.160 --> 3:26:35.680]  it a crime.
[3:26:35.680 --> 3:26:43.480]  And that's what's going on here, that's why all the lying and covering it up all along,
[3:26:43.480 --> 3:26:46.160]  and they're still doing it today.
[3:26:46.160 --> 3:26:54.800]  If you read the investigation, the press conference they heard earlier this week, by the FBI,
[3:26:54.800 --> 3:26:57.120]  it does not add up at all.
[3:26:57.120 --> 3:27:02.280]  If you read the article in Today's New York Times, it doesn't add up indeed.
[3:27:02.280 --> 3:27:14.160]  It appears from Today's New York Times, the FBI, for example, then set the investigation
[3:27:14.160 --> 3:27:22.680]  up by scientists in such a way that no one knew exactly what they were doing, and could
[3:27:22.680 --> 3:27:28.640]  not communicate with anyone else, and only communicated with the FBI, and only looked
[3:27:28.640 --> 3:27:34.720]  at samples provided to them by the FBI, and had to take on good faith from the FBI what
[3:27:34.720 --> 3:27:35.880]  the samples were.
[3:27:35.880 --> 3:27:45.160]  So, you have the case where the FBI completely controlled, dominated the scientific investigation,
[3:27:45.160 --> 3:27:46.160]  including the timing.
[3:27:46.160 --> 3:27:51.800]  Well, Dr. Boyle, I want to go through that, and as best we can piece together who exactly
[3:27:51.800 --> 3:27:56.680]  did it and why they did it, but when the main line public on the street at coffee shops
[3:27:56.680 --> 3:28:01.000]  are saying, can you believe the government launched the anthrax attack, they're in trouble.
[3:28:01.000 --> 3:28:03.960]  I mean, the words out, the White House was on the drug that fights it.
[3:28:03.960 --> 3:28:05.360]  The words out, it went to their enemies.
[3:28:05.360 --> 3:28:08.080]  The words out, they set this last guy up.
[3:28:08.080 --> 3:28:11.400]  I mean, I think we have a crisis of confidence here.
[3:28:11.400 --> 3:28:14.960]  Do you think the FBI knows just how ridiculous they look right now?
[3:28:14.960 --> 3:28:21.160]  Well, Alex, I think the important issue to realize now is this.
[3:28:21.160 --> 3:28:26.160]  You know, the FBI has been lying and covering up on this, at least since the time I called
[3:28:26.160 --> 3:28:39.120]  it a moment, but there is today in existence a stockpile of super weapons grade anthrax
[3:28:39.120 --> 3:28:48.320]  that is under the control of the original perpetrators of the anthrax attacks of October
[3:28:48.320 --> 3:28:55.760]  2001, and that stockpile can and will be used again.
[3:28:55.760 --> 3:29:06.640]  When their masters decide that it would be politically convenient to scare and terrorize
[3:29:06.640 --> 3:29:07.640]  the American people.
[3:29:07.640 --> 3:29:09.480]  All right, we're going to skip this break, too.
[3:29:09.480 --> 3:29:10.480]  Hold on.
[3:29:10.480 --> 3:29:11.480]  I just want the stations to know that.
[3:29:11.480 --> 3:29:13.320]  InfoWars.com listeners, we're going to continue.
[3:29:13.320 --> 3:29:14.840]  Everybody else, we'll be back in three minutes.
[3:29:14.840 --> 3:29:16.640]  Got to tune over to InfoWars.com.
[3:29:16.640 --> 3:29:19.240]  Here we go with Dr. Francis Boyle.
[3:29:19.240 --> 3:29:22.400]  Okay, Doc, I mean, that's the point I keep making.
[3:29:22.400 --> 3:29:26.640]  If they carried out the attacks and all the evidence, I mean, it's 100%, they did it,
[3:29:26.640 --> 3:29:30.880]  from motive to means, to the evidence, to the witnesses, to the CIPRO, all of it.
[3:29:30.880 --> 3:29:31.880]  It's ridiculous.
[3:29:31.880 --> 3:29:36.000]  A, what did they think they were doing because they haven't gotten away with it?
[3:29:36.000 --> 3:29:39.400]  I mean, this is really getting them more than even 9-11.
[3:29:39.400 --> 3:29:44.880]  And then B, getting into what you just mentioned, yes, they're still in power.
[3:29:44.880 --> 3:29:46.120]  They're still going.
[3:29:46.120 --> 3:29:50.400]  They could aerosolize this and say Al Qaeda did it and launch an attack on Iran.
[3:29:50.400 --> 3:29:51.400]  Please continue.
[3:29:51.400 --> 3:29:54.480]  Well, they could launch another attack on us.
[3:29:54.480 --> 3:30:01.280]  And including on Congress, the judiciary, the media, you know, the media is the...
[3:30:01.280 --> 3:30:02.760]  You think this was a beta test?
[3:30:02.760 --> 3:30:04.560]  Do you think this was a beta test?
[3:30:04.560 --> 3:30:05.560]  Army?
[3:30:05.560 --> 3:30:08.840]  Do you think that this was a beta test then?
[3:30:08.840 --> 3:30:09.840]  What do you mean by a beta test?
[3:30:09.840 --> 3:30:14.160]  The first anthrax attack was a beta test to see what the media would do, how Congress
[3:30:14.160 --> 3:30:15.680]  would respond?
[3:30:15.680 --> 3:30:23.360]  Well, I believe the first anthrax attack was designed to ram through the Patriot Act because
[3:30:23.360 --> 3:30:29.360]  Senator Daschle and Senator Lay were holding it up.
[3:30:29.360 --> 3:30:34.720]  And once the anthrax occurred, the attacks occurred, it rammed right through.
[3:30:34.720 --> 3:30:42.680]  Indeed, on the renewal of the USA Patriot Act, Senator Feingold was holding it up, and all
[3:30:42.680 --> 3:30:47.640]  of a sudden, out of nowhere, some white-powdered substance appeared at the...
[3:30:47.640 --> 3:30:49.640]  I think it was one of the Senate office buildings.
[3:30:49.640 --> 3:30:50.640]  Yeah, I remember that.
[3:30:50.640 --> 3:30:55.760]  There was an anthrax of scare, and then all of a sudden, the renewal of the Patriot Act
[3:30:55.760 --> 3:30:56.760]  went through.
[3:30:56.760 --> 3:30:57.760]  Now, that was not real anthrax.
[3:30:57.760 --> 3:30:58.760]  Well, I mean, this wasn't...
[3:30:58.760 --> 3:31:00.760]  It didn't have to be real anthrax this time.
[3:31:00.760 --> 3:31:01.760]  It's a reminder.
[3:31:01.760 --> 3:31:08.760]  Before your question on the media, I think the culprits here wanted to send a message
[3:31:08.760 --> 3:31:14.920]  to the news media as well, that if you really cover this story, you risk your lives.
[3:31:14.920 --> 3:31:16.280]  No, that's it.
[3:31:16.280 --> 3:31:19.920]  And then the people that did a story on the Bush daughters falling down drunk in Austin,
[3:31:19.920 --> 3:31:21.920]  the editor gets the first letter.
[3:31:21.920 --> 3:31:26.320]  I mean, so this is a thinly veiled threat to everyone.
[3:31:26.320 --> 3:31:30.360]  So I guess the perpetrators, that's why Congress goes along with the wars and goes along with
[3:31:30.360 --> 3:31:34.000]  all of it, because I've talked to people in Congress who probably are like, yeah, yeah,
[3:31:34.000 --> 3:31:35.000]  we know what happened.
[3:31:35.000 --> 3:31:39.000]  And I mean, do you agree that it's just an open mafia message that is what you're saying,
[3:31:39.000 --> 3:31:40.000]  and that Congress knows?
[3:31:40.000 --> 3:31:42.800]  I mean, they know who did it.
[3:31:42.800 --> 3:31:46.080]  I think, you know, people in Congress, I stay in touch with them.
[3:31:46.080 --> 3:31:49.760]  I've sent them my materials, you know, they're smart, intelligent people.
[3:31:49.760 --> 3:31:52.720]  I think they know who was responsible for this.
[3:31:52.720 --> 3:31:59.480]  I don't think they believe the Cock and Bull FBI explanation, but of course they're afraid.
[3:31:59.480 --> 3:32:01.360]  Their lives are on the line.
[3:32:01.360 --> 3:32:09.600]  I think what we have to do now is insist on a full-scale congressional investigation.
[3:32:09.600 --> 3:32:15.000]  Not some type of presidential commission cover up along the lines of the 9-11 report, but
[3:32:15.000 --> 3:32:20.720]  then the neo-concil probably just mail a hundred letters of anthrax, I guess the whole nation
[3:32:20.720 --> 3:32:21.720]  is kind of held hostage.
[3:32:21.720 --> 3:32:25.400]  We're going to come back to the full audience, recap that and get into your idea, your plan
[3:32:25.400 --> 3:32:30.080]  to deal with this and then cover any other evidence that backs up what you're saying
[3:32:30.080 --> 3:32:34.600]  with our guest, here we go.
[3:32:34.600 --> 3:32:41.720]  Dr. Francis Boyle, one of the former top bio-weapons experts for the federal government helped
[3:32:41.720 --> 3:32:49.240]  write some of the major bio-weapons conventions internationally for the United States.
[3:32:49.240 --> 3:32:54.040]  Day one, he tried to help with the investigation and found out who was really behind it.
[3:32:54.040 --> 3:32:58.680]  These are hardcore killers, and they'll do anything to scare you into submission after
[3:32:58.680 --> 3:33:03.880]  their little event, they pulled off on 9-11, they weren't done, they launched their anthrax
[3:33:03.880 --> 3:33:08.280]  attack and they did their dark winter scenario a few years before that congressional funded
[3:33:08.280 --> 3:33:16.600]  drill of massive anthrax spraying in Texas, in Oklahoma and martial law being declared.
[3:33:16.600 --> 3:33:20.200]  You better believe, ladies and gentlemen, they got private contractors ready to spray it
[3:33:20.200 --> 3:33:24.480]  on your cities and then they'll grab some guy with a beard and put him on TV and say
[3:33:24.480 --> 3:33:26.680]  he did it, it might even be a hologram.
[3:33:26.680 --> 3:33:33.760]  These guys are just, there's no end to what they'll do, and Dr. Boyle is our guest.
[3:33:33.760 --> 3:33:38.320]  During the last seven, you just started calling for a congressional investigation, the country
[3:33:38.320 --> 3:33:41.360]  is being held hostage by the real terrorist.
[3:33:41.360 --> 3:33:44.400]  You've got the floor, I'd like you to talk more about that and then go back into evidence
[3:33:44.400 --> 3:33:48.160]  because it's so voluminous, anything else you'd like to talk about.
[3:33:48.160 --> 3:33:56.040]  Right, well, we need hearings along the lines of what we had in the Watergate hearings
[3:33:56.040 --> 3:34:02.840]  under President Nixon, where we have open public hearings by a joint committee of Congress
[3:34:02.840 --> 3:34:11.360]  because this attack was designed to shut Congress down and to, which it did, it succeeded to
[3:34:11.360 --> 3:34:15.880]  the best of my knowledge of the first time in the history of our republic where Congress
[3:34:15.880 --> 3:34:19.640]  was actually shut down and rendered inoperative.
[3:34:19.640 --> 3:34:25.080]  The House went out of business, the Senate said it would stay in session, but with the
[3:34:25.080 --> 3:34:28.640]  House out of business, you can't do business.
[3:34:28.640 --> 3:34:34.920]  So this is a political crime of the first magnitude.
[3:34:34.920 --> 3:34:41.360]  The Supreme Court as well also shut down and the media were attacked, our fourth estate.
[3:34:41.360 --> 3:34:46.560]  Of course, the presidency and the executive branch was not attacked.
[3:34:46.560 --> 3:34:52.920]  I leave that to you to figure it out, but we do know the White House was on CIPRO.
[3:34:52.920 --> 3:34:58.120]  So that's really what we need, and maybe if there are open public hearings by Congress,
[3:34:58.120 --> 3:35:04.840]  you know, people put under oath with subpoena power, members of Congress then might feel
[3:35:04.840 --> 3:35:12.760]  some protection from further threats by the people currently under control of the anthrax.
[3:35:12.760 --> 3:35:21.360]  You also have to tie into this the large numbers of dead microbiologists that have appeared
[3:35:21.360 --> 3:35:31.600]  since around the summer before these events, when the New York Times revealed the existence
[3:35:31.600 --> 3:35:40.680]  of the covert anthrax weapons programs run by the CIA and Battelle, and that too is in
[3:35:40.680 --> 3:35:41.680]  the public record.
[3:35:41.680 --> 3:35:43.840]  Yeah, those are what keeps going.
[3:35:43.840 --> 3:35:51.160]  Ivan's is only the latest dead microbiologist, so you are correct.
[3:35:51.160 --> 3:35:57.360]  These culprits are playing for keeps, they are prepared to kill people, they've tried
[3:35:57.360 --> 3:35:59.840]  to kill people, I think they have killed people.
[3:35:59.840 --> 3:36:06.480]  Well, there's no doubt under PDD 51, the continuity of government system has taken over the government.
[3:36:06.480 --> 3:36:10.680]  Congress knows they were hit by a biological attack from the executive branch and the shadow
[3:36:10.680 --> 3:36:14.160]  government controlled by foreign agencies, foreign intelligence operations, British
[3:36:14.160 --> 3:36:20.480]  and Israeli predominantly, and they have now bullied the media and the Congress into full
[3:36:20.480 --> 3:36:23.080]  submission.
[3:36:23.080 --> 3:36:26.440]  They are hopping mad at the Russians for not submitting, God knows what they'll pull
[3:36:26.440 --> 3:36:33.280]  on them now, and we are to completely controlled by megalomaniacs who have limitless will,
[3:36:33.280 --> 3:36:39.560]  dark will, to do God knows what, Mr. Boyle, I mean I can't imagine a more nightmare scenario
[3:36:39.560 --> 3:36:44.840]  and it's so transparent because they want it to be transparent, don't they?
[3:36:44.840 --> 3:36:50.680]  Well, I think it's transparent for people who are really following what's going on and
[3:36:50.680 --> 3:36:55.960]  adding it up, but I don't think for the vast majority of the American people, I do think
[3:36:55.960 --> 3:37:02.360]  you are correcting your analysis that the presidential doctrine for continuity of government
[3:37:02.360 --> 3:37:09.800]  was put into effect on September 11th, and it's still in operation today, and that we
[3:37:09.800 --> 3:37:16.920]  do have, in fact, the secret government that is really running things behind the scenes,
[3:37:16.920 --> 3:37:23.400]  probably Cheney is in charge of it, and so there are really two governments out there,
[3:37:23.400 --> 3:37:26.000]  and that can account for a lot of anomalies.
[3:37:26.000 --> 3:37:34.160]  For example, what happened at the Minut Air Force Base with the nuclear cruise missiles,
[3:37:34.160 --> 3:37:40.240]  that decision to deploy those nuclear cruise missiles had to come directly from a chain
[3:37:40.240 --> 3:37:41.240]  of command.
[3:37:41.240 --> 3:37:47.920]  It was not a mistake, and with the continuity of government, then there are now two chains
[3:37:47.920 --> 3:37:55.200]  of command, so I think you can add up a lot of things by realizing that there's the open
[3:37:55.200 --> 3:38:01.280]  government and then there's the COG in operation, right?
[3:38:01.280 --> 3:38:06.600]  Mr. Boyle, a lot of people that don't understand history or the way subterfuge works, they
[3:38:06.600 --> 3:38:12.720]  wonder why you're alive, why I'm alive, why so many others are alive if this is all true,
[3:38:12.720 --> 3:38:15.520]  and I would just say it's because they don't want to validate what we've said, they don't
[3:38:15.520 --> 3:38:20.040]  want to put underline our words, they don't want to highlight what we've said and done,
[3:38:20.040 --> 3:38:23.720]  but I do feel the wings of death flapping about, I've been threatened, I've had all sorts of
[3:38:23.720 --> 3:38:27.800]  other stuff happen, a lot of other people have been killed, so it's not a joke to me,
[3:38:27.800 --> 3:38:33.480]  but I just think my lucky stars thank God every day, I'm still here, but what's your
[3:38:33.480 --> 3:38:38.680]  take on why other whistleblowers and other prominent people are still alive, if these
[3:38:38.680 --> 3:38:43.200]  guys are such murderers and such killers, why they haven't come after us?
[3:38:43.200 --> 3:38:51.000]  Well, Dr. Ivins is not alive, he joins the growing list of microbiologists who are now
[3:38:51.000 --> 3:38:55.320]  dead, I can't recall the last time I looked at that list, but it was somewhere in the
[3:38:55.320 --> 3:39:03.280]  area of 15 to 20 microbiologists who have died, it's a lot more than that, maybe 20 or
[3:39:03.280 --> 3:39:09.920]  something like that, if you look at it globally, it's like 20 in the U.S. being shot in the
[3:39:09.920 --> 3:39:17.040]  back of the head, being tortured to death, being drowned, it's hundreds worldwide, so
[3:39:17.040 --> 3:39:24.120]  they are I think disposing of people who directly know what's going on, I know Senator
[3:39:24.120 --> 3:39:33.960]  Wellstone disappeared too, so you know, I take it the reason others are around is that
[3:39:33.960 --> 3:39:38.520]  they don't really care, they have all the leaders of power, they're actually glad we're
[3:39:38.520 --> 3:39:43.000]  here saying they control the Congress and murder whoever they want, they enjoy it, and
[3:39:43.000 --> 3:39:47.880]  all the big guerrillas that work in Army Intelligence think it's real funny, they love their cocaine
[3:39:47.880 --> 3:39:51.880]  money, they love their houses in Maui, they love Butcher in this country, wide open, good
[3:39:51.880 --> 3:39:54.320]  job guys, please continue Dr. Boyle.
[3:39:54.320 --> 3:39:59.160]  Well I don't, you know I don't think they think we're very effective one way or the
[3:39:59.160 --> 3:40:02.080]  other, otherwise they would take us out, sure.
[3:40:02.080 --> 3:40:06.520]  It's just so, and they're just looting everything, this is only one little area of crimes they're
[3:40:06.520 --> 3:40:12.120]  committing, I mean I look at it doctor, they are just raping the country, the world end
[3:40:12.120 --> 3:40:19.400]  to end, and then I just can't believe we've gone this bad, do you ever pinch yourself
[3:40:19.400 --> 3:40:22.120]  when you're seeing these type things happen?
[3:40:22.120 --> 3:40:28.920]  Well, you know it could be the twilight of the American Republic, I hate to say that,
[3:40:28.920 --> 3:40:35.960]  you know I've been a lawyer since January 10, 1977, taking an oath to uphold the constitutional
[3:40:35.960 --> 3:40:43.600]  laws of the United States, as my father was before me, and it could be we're at the end
[3:40:43.600 --> 3:40:46.120]  of the line here for democracy in America.
[3:40:46.120 --> 3:40:51.040]  That's right, you're a top constitutional law scholar as well, we just can't cover all
[3:40:51.040 --> 3:40:53.360]  of your illustrious background.
[3:40:53.360 --> 3:40:58.840]  Let's go over more of the evidence, more areas with the curious case of Dr. Ivins, I mean
[3:40:58.840 --> 3:41:03.480]  the media you notice it was so hard to find that he died in government custody, and then
[3:41:03.480 --> 3:41:06.920]  supposedly he gets these pills while locked up when he was about to be released, and then
[3:41:06.920 --> 3:41:12.360]  this doctor that said he was crazy and subtle, these things turns out as a literal PCP head
[3:41:12.360 --> 3:41:17.480]  who isn't even a doctor and is some kind of stoolie bird, I mean it's just getting shoddier
[3:41:17.480 --> 3:41:18.480]  and shoddier.
[3:41:18.480 --> 3:41:24.240]  It is, I mean if you just read any of the accounts, I mean now surprisingly you even
[3:41:24.240 --> 3:41:32.440]  have people in the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, experts, microbiologists, former
[3:41:32.440 --> 3:41:39.920]  bio warfare people saying they don't believe Ivins did it, that's correct, that's how flimsy
[3:41:39.920 --> 3:41:49.320]  the cover-up has become, again just read today's New York Times, the more facts come out the
[3:41:49.320 --> 3:41:54.040]  harder it comes to explain any of these things.
[3:41:54.040 --> 3:42:01.640]  Why did they rush out and grab Ivins and killed him, and then made the ridiculous story up
[3:42:01.640 --> 3:42:05.600]  about oh he's been our main suspect for four years, when just a year ago they were saying
[3:42:05.600 --> 3:42:11.400]  the only suspect was Hatfield, I mean is that a total contempt for the public's memory or
[3:42:11.400 --> 3:42:12.880]  what is that?
[3:42:12.880 --> 3:42:23.000]  Well yeah I think so, I don't know if Ivins was killed one way or the other, but you
[3:42:23.000 --> 3:42:29.200]  know they first blamed it on Hatfield knowing he wasn't responsible, but that could stall
[3:42:29.200 --> 3:42:34.360]  and delay everything for a long time and see if they could get Hatfield to crack up and
[3:42:34.360 --> 3:42:41.240]  he didn't, you know he fought back, Ivins, so then they moved to him and they got him
[3:42:41.240 --> 3:42:48.520]  to crack up and either he was off by himself or we still don't know the circumstances one
[3:42:48.520 --> 3:42:54.000]  way or the other, so now they have a dead man and the dead man tells no tales so they
[3:42:54.000 --> 3:42:56.480]  just pinned it on the dead man, the dead microbiologist.
[3:42:56.480 --> 3:43:01.680]  Yeah it's easy, they have a dead defendant, talking about the FBI, they've always been
[3:43:01.680 --> 3:43:06.640]  hooked in with the mafia since their conception, they're in prohibition being paid off, so
[3:43:06.640 --> 3:43:13.480]  from their zenith or really birth I should say, from their genesis they have been mobsters
[3:43:13.480 --> 3:43:18.920]  and now, now I mean I've seen the FBI out on the streets in places, they're really scary
[3:43:18.920 --> 3:43:22.760]  people, I mean do you think the average FBI agent really understands they're working for
[3:43:22.760 --> 3:43:26.720]  basically a Gestapo organization?
[3:43:26.720 --> 3:43:34.760]  Well actually a Mr. Swearingen who had been an FBI agent and retired and was decorated
[3:43:34.760 --> 3:43:42.720]  wrote a book on the FBI and called it the American Gestapo repeatedly, he was a veteran
[3:43:42.720 --> 3:43:50.640]  FBI agent, I think that is correct, the last time we discussed the matter, I think I told
[3:43:50.640 --> 3:43:57.080]  you the two FBI agents, well an agent for the FBI and another for the FBI, CIA joint
[3:43:57.080 --> 3:44:03.560]  terrorism task force, showed up at my office, interrogated me for an hour, tried to get
[3:44:03.560 --> 3:44:13.000]  me to become an informant on my Arab and Muslim clients which would have violated their constitutional
[3:44:13.000 --> 3:44:18.720]  rights and my ethical obligations as an attorney, of course I refused to become an informant
[3:44:18.720 --> 3:44:25.240]  for the FBI but I did tell them that I was trying to cooperate with the FBI on the anthrax
[3:44:25.240 --> 3:44:33.440]  investigation and told them of my phone calls there to Mr. Bowman to try to do something
[3:44:33.440 --> 3:44:42.240]  on the anthrax investigation and then the FBI, CIA went out and put me on all the United
[3:44:42.240 --> 3:44:46.600]  States government's terrorist watch lists, every one of them, my lawyer says there are
[3:44:46.600 --> 3:44:51.680]  five or six of them and as far as he could figure out I'm on all of them, so that gives
[3:44:51.680 --> 3:44:59.640]  you a pretty good idea of what's going on here, one guy trying to help unravel the anthrax
[3:44:59.640 --> 3:45:03.360]  investigation gets put on the terrorist watch list.
[3:45:03.360 --> 3:45:08.320]  Well, you know I know it's all about power and who wins but there's no doubt that I'm
[3:45:08.320 --> 3:45:13.160]  trying to defend this country what's left of it, so are you and you know guys we don't
[3:45:13.160 --> 3:45:17.760]  expect you to quit the FBI or even stand up for the country but at least you can passively
[3:45:17.760 --> 3:45:22.680]  not join the evil, I mean is it that much fun to destroy America, I mean I don't understand
[3:45:22.680 --> 3:45:26.480]  the enjoyment, where do they find these people?
[3:45:26.480 --> 3:45:31.600]  Well there were, we have to remember there were some good solid FBI people there up in
[3:45:31.600 --> 3:45:34.960]  Minneapolis trying to get that warrant.
[3:45:34.960 --> 3:45:39.720]  But notice they're always off in a field office, I understand it's compartmentalized, yeah.
[3:45:39.720 --> 3:45:44.200]  But they tried, those in the field, Crowley and the rest of them tried very hard to get
[3:45:44.200 --> 3:45:51.400]  that warrant into Mussali's computer that very well could have unraveled 9-11 and that
[3:45:51.400 --> 3:45:58.640]  was killed by Marion Spike Bowman who was the same guy I was dealing with in good faith.
[3:45:58.640 --> 3:46:03.240]  And then by the way the FBI agents that blocked the anthrax and the 9-11 investigation even
[3:46:03.240 --> 3:46:08.280]  before, they all got record cash bonuses and those that tried to stop the attacks they
[3:46:08.280 --> 3:46:10.120]  got demoted.
[3:46:10.120 --> 3:46:17.560]  Right, the people who were in charge of the cover-ups on both 9-11 and the anthrax have
[3:46:17.560 --> 3:46:24.920]  all been promoted which indicates they've done what their masters wanted them to do.
[3:46:24.920 --> 3:46:33.480]  And I think the reason why, you know, eventually if we can unravel who was behind the anthrax
[3:46:33.480 --> 3:46:37.240]  attacks we're going to find out who really was behind 9-11.
[3:46:37.240 --> 3:46:44.440]  And that's why they're so desperate to cover everything up and lie about it.
[3:46:44.440 --> 3:46:47.360]  I know you have a lot of gravitas, sir, so you'd like to be very careful what you say,
[3:46:47.360 --> 3:46:51.240]  but do you think a person of interest needs to be looked at as this Philip Zach person
[3:46:51.240 --> 3:46:54.040]  or is he another red herring?
[3:46:54.040 --> 3:46:59.400]  I really don't know much about Mr. Zach, just what I've read in the public record, but
[3:46:59.400 --> 3:47:06.400]  certainly at the top of everyone's list should be Mr. Patrick who did this type of work for
[3:47:06.400 --> 3:47:12.800]  the CIA, and Ken Alebeck who did this type of work for the Soviet Union.
[3:47:12.800 --> 3:47:18.560]  Indeed, Alebeck has made statements in the public that are inconsistent and simply not
[3:47:18.560 --> 3:47:19.560]  true.
[3:47:19.560 --> 3:47:25.520]  Alebeck was brought over here by the CIA, so he's on their payroll, and Patrick was
[3:47:25.520 --> 3:47:31.520]  on the payroll, so I would, you know, certainly identify them at the top of the list.
[3:47:31.520 --> 3:47:37.040]  Alebeck wrote about and was over an accidental release, remember in the Soviet Union on that
[3:47:37.040 --> 3:47:38.040] ...
[3:47:38.040 --> 3:47:39.040]  Third law.
[3:47:39.040 --> 3:47:41.840]  Yeah, was it the Kamchakya Peninsula?
[3:47:41.840 --> 3:47:42.840]  Right.
[3:47:42.840 --> 3:47:43.840]  Yeah.
[3:47:43.840 --> 3:47:49.800]  Well, third law, which is in Central Russia, but you have to understand that it's just
[3:47:49.800 --> 3:47:53.280]  not Fort Detrick here that could have done this.
[3:47:53.280 --> 3:48:00.000]  The culture from what I can see came from Fort Detrick, but again, assuming any of this
[3:48:00.000 --> 3:48:07.000]  information coming out is correct, 25% of it came from Fort Detrick, and 75% of it came
[3:48:07.000 --> 3:48:14.120]  from the Dugway Proving Ground run by the Army and with the CIA and Battelle working
[3:48:14.120 --> 3:48:15.120]  there.
[3:48:15.120 --> 3:48:23.200]  So my guess is that the culture itself came from Fort Detrick, and then it was shipped
[3:48:23.200 --> 3:48:34.560]  out to Dugway to be weaponized, that is, to turn it into a trillion spores program, the
[3:48:34.560 --> 3:48:44.440]  aerosolization, the etiquette on the silica covering, which involved nanotechnology, and
[3:48:44.440 --> 3:48:47.920]  then the electrostatic charges.
[3:48:47.920 --> 3:48:49.640]  How ridiculous is it?
[3:48:49.640 --> 3:48:57.400]  I believe it was weaponized at Dugway, I don't believe it was weaponized at Fort Detrick,
[3:48:57.400 --> 3:48:58.400]  per se.
[3:48:58.400 --> 3:49:01.240]  How ridiculous is it for them to...
[3:49:01.240 --> 3:49:08.280]  So we have a team of people here working on this, it's not simply a question of one
[3:49:08.280 --> 3:49:11.440]  or two or three people.
[3:49:11.440 --> 3:49:16.240]  And that's why we have all these big top bio weapons scientists saying, you're claiming
[3:49:16.240 --> 3:49:23.400]  that Ivan's was able to make this in his basement, that he was able to get something and then
[3:49:23.400 --> 3:49:24.400]  weaponize it.
[3:49:24.400 --> 3:49:27.840]  You know, they're saying that's ridiculous because they know what it takes, don't they?
[3:49:27.840 --> 3:49:30.120]  Sure, it's completely preposterous.
[3:49:30.120 --> 3:49:35.040]  Even Mr. Spurtzel used to head up Fort Detrick said it can't be done.
[3:49:35.040 --> 3:49:43.840]  So I think both of these scientists involved in the investigation, like me, probably assume
[3:49:43.840 --> 3:49:48.360]  the FBI was dealing with them in good faith, but that simply isn't the case.
[3:49:48.360 --> 3:49:53.080]  Has this changed your view of the world working on this case, seeing this and seeing how the
[3:49:53.080 --> 3:49:55.080]  federal government's been behaving?
[3:49:55.080 --> 3:49:57.600]  No, not really.
[3:49:57.600 --> 3:50:05.800]  You know, I'm 58 years old, I've seen... going back to the Kennedy assassination, the two
[3:50:05.800 --> 3:50:11.640]  Kennedy assassinations and the King assassination, this doesn't surprise me at all.
[3:50:11.640 --> 3:50:16.920]  I was just saying because you said that you thought the FBI would do something, but I
[3:50:16.920 --> 3:50:18.680]  guess you weren't thinking they were involved.
[3:50:18.680 --> 3:50:22.720]  We're going to skip this break, too, with our guest to be back in the final segment.
[3:50:22.720 --> 3:50:26.480]  The only place to listen to the behind the scenes is the InfoWars.com stream.
[3:50:26.480 --> 3:50:30.040]  You've got to go over to the site and click on that screen, folks.
[3:50:30.040 --> 3:50:36.040]  Okay, Dr. Boyle, this has been an amazing interview and I just want you in the next
[3:50:36.040 --> 3:50:40.880]  six, seven minutes or so to cover any other key points, any other areas, any websites you
[3:50:40.880 --> 3:50:41.880]  want to plug.
[3:50:41.880 --> 3:50:42.880]  You've got the floor.
[3:50:42.880 --> 3:50:50.800]  Well, I have a book on the subject called BioWarsfare and Terrorism, Clarity Press, which
[3:50:50.800 --> 3:50:58.080]  you can read that sets out the case and the basic points that I'm making here today.
[3:50:58.080 --> 3:51:06.280]  Everything I'm saying in there has been confirmed by the latest revelations.
[3:51:06.280 --> 3:51:13.840]  In addition, since that book went to press, I have reviewed the Pentagon's report to Congress
[3:51:13.840 --> 3:51:23.160]  on their chemical and biological warfare programs, and it's very clear they are engaged in the
[3:51:23.160 --> 3:51:29.920]  development and use of anthrax as a weapon of warfare.
[3:51:29.920 --> 3:51:38.400]  It is also clear, if you read through there, the Pentagon in this BioWarsfare program is
[3:51:38.400 --> 3:51:48.120]  now testing, open-air testing, which is something that Congress passed a statute to prohibit,
[3:51:48.120 --> 3:51:56.960]  and yet there was put in there a presidential waiver, so we have to understand the stockpile
[3:51:56.960 --> 3:52:04.840]  of this superweapons-grade anthrax is still there, probably at Dugway or perhaps Battelle
[3:52:04.840 --> 3:52:12.520]  in Ohio, and waiting to be used again when the Pentagon and the CIA decide they want
[3:52:12.520 --> 3:52:15.080]  to terrorize the American people.
[3:52:15.080 --> 3:52:21.360]  Cheney has said, if there's another terrorist attack, he'll claim it on Iran.
[3:52:21.360 --> 3:52:26.920]  There's an election coming up that they're going to want to win for McCain, who's the
[3:52:26.920 --> 3:52:33.080]  one who's in the pocket of all the neoconservatives currently running the government and the continuity
[3:52:33.080 --> 3:52:34.080]  of government.
[3:52:34.080 --> 3:52:41.160]  So, there are a variety of occasions coming up for these people to use this anthrax and
[3:52:41.160 --> 3:52:48.400]  panic the American people either towards war, towards a police state, or towards electing
[3:52:48.400 --> 3:52:52.200]  the presidential candidate they want.
[3:52:52.200 --> 3:52:57.720]  Amazing, absolutely amazing, we've got a few stations that are about to join us when
[3:52:57.720 --> 3:53:04.120]  we come back out of this segment, so we're going to plug the book again, I want everybody
[3:53:04.120 --> 3:53:10.320]  out there to get it, because this is life and death, I mean, it is a military culture
[3:53:10.320 --> 3:53:16.440]  to sacrifice ponds, and they have just gotten way too fast and loose, it's not enough to
[3:53:16.440 --> 3:53:21.720]  kill a million two Iraqis, it's not enough to bomb Serbia into the Stone Age with DU,
[3:53:21.720 --> 3:53:26.560]  you know, they see us as absolute cattle folks, and this sick culture has got to be stopped.
[3:53:26.560 --> 3:53:31.360]  We're coming back live right now.
[3:53:31.360 --> 3:53:39.080]  Dr. Francis Boyle has a book out on the anthrax attacks, a scholarly detailed book that everyone
[3:53:39.080 --> 3:53:44.200]  needs to get and get out to their friends and family, this is life and death, we don't
[3:53:44.200 --> 3:53:47.280]  expose these people, they're going to use terror attacks to completely overthrow the
[3:53:47.280 --> 3:53:52.480]  country and have a continuity of government system that even dominates Congress, the old
[3:53:52.480 --> 3:53:57.600]  Bush has even taken authority away from Homeland Security to himself, it's unprecedented
[3:53:57.600 --> 3:54:02.120]  at dark times, and I don't take pleasure fighting these people, I know, I mean, it is, I don't
[3:54:02.120 --> 3:54:06.760]  even have fear, I just know, man, this is serious, I don't like messing with these people, but
[3:54:06.760 --> 3:54:13.920]  I have to, you can't give in to them, and Dr. Boyle, we just commend you, the old 5,000
[3:54:13.920 --> 3:54:20.000]  year old system of sacrificing pawns, going back to, you know, being invented in India.
[3:54:20.000 --> 3:54:25.040]  Generals will sacrifice a thousand, 10,000, 20,000 troops to draw an enemy in over a ridge
[3:54:25.040 --> 3:54:28.960]  thinking it's a larger force to then have their army behind the hill crush them, knowing
[3:54:28.960 --> 3:54:31.080]  it's going to kill their own force.
[3:54:31.080 --> 3:54:34.920]  In archery training, it's not just in the movie Braveheart, but it's historical cases
[3:54:34.920 --> 3:54:41.160]  of where different armies in Japan, in Europe proper, in Africa, you know, the Egyptians
[3:54:41.160 --> 3:54:46.960]  would fire on their own troops to kill some of the other troops, that's an idea, collateral
[3:54:46.960 --> 3:54:52.400]  damage, and it's nothing to the war planners running our country for the big banks to mail
[3:54:52.400 --> 3:54:56.720]  out some anthrax and kill some people, it's nothing for them to kill kids now, to kill
[3:54:56.720 --> 3:55:02.560]  a million two Iraqis, as I said, and we better realize that what's done to the Iraqis will
[3:55:02.560 --> 3:55:08.000]  be done to us, you report you so, Dr. Boyle, can you speak to that idea and then plug your
[3:55:08.000 --> 3:55:09.000]  book?
[3:55:09.000 --> 3:55:17.160]  Well, sure, I went to the University of Chicago with all these neo-conservatives, Wolfwoods
[3:55:17.160 --> 3:55:23.720]  was there, Chalabi, Khalil's, Dodd, Shilsky, all the rest of them, they were getting their
[3:55:23.720 --> 3:55:30.320]  PhDs and I was getting my undergraduate degree, later got my PhD from Harvard.
[3:55:30.320 --> 3:55:35.760]  I went through the exact same program that produced all these neo-cons, the political
[3:55:35.760 --> 3:55:44.480]  science department, Leo Strauss, the godfather of the neo-cons, his mentor and sponsor in
[3:55:44.480 --> 3:55:54.080]  Germany was Professor Karl Schmidt, who went on to become the most notorious Nazi law professor
[3:55:54.080 --> 3:56:02.600]  of that benighted era and justified every hideous atrocity the Nazis inflicted on anyone,
[3:56:02.600 --> 3:56:03.600]  including the Jews.
[3:56:03.600 --> 3:56:08.960]  So now his grandchildren are Alberti Gonzalez and Attorney General, the current Attorney
[3:56:08.960 --> 3:56:13.320]  General, Mukasey and John Yu.
[3:56:13.320 --> 3:56:18.880]  That's correct, we have to understand, Alex, that and they tried to train me to become
[3:56:18.880 --> 3:56:19.880]  one of these people.
[3:56:19.880 --> 3:56:25.000]  Don't you have the special PhD, the only one a year from Harvard, don't you have the Kissinger
[3:56:25.000 --> 3:56:26.000]  PhD?
[3:56:26.000 --> 3:56:31.840]  Yeah, I went through the same program that Kissinger did, indeed at the Center for International
[3:56:31.840 --> 3:56:36.640]  Affairs, they gave me Kissinger's old office, his file cabinets were sitting there when
[3:56:36.640 --> 3:56:37.640]  I moved in.
[3:56:37.640 --> 3:56:45.960]  But the point is, we have to understand these neo-conservatives then are in fact neo-Nazis
[3:56:45.960 --> 3:56:54.680]  and this is a neo-Nazi mentality that has taken over our government and these are the
[3:56:54.680 --> 3:57:03.080]  people making these decisions and that then gets back to why they have no problem unleashing
[3:57:03.080 --> 3:57:08.920]  an anthrax attack on the American people in Congress, indeed, they're anti-democratic.
[3:57:08.920 --> 3:57:13.120]  Professor Boyle, I can go into overdrive on this radio show, but I don't want to keep
[3:57:13.120 --> 3:57:18.840]  you, the show's over in one minute, but I want to extend the show for 10 minutes commercial
[3:57:18.840 --> 3:57:23.200]  free just for the internet streams, but that's hundreds of thousands listening on the internet
[3:57:23.200 --> 3:57:27.640]  and on tens of thousands later spread out on video.
[3:57:27.640 --> 3:57:30.960]  Can you do 10 more minutes right now just so you can finish this statement?
[3:57:30.960 --> 3:57:31.960]  Sure.
[3:57:31.960 --> 3:57:36.080]  Okay, we're going to go into overdrive, want to thank the Genesis Network and all the affiliates.
[3:57:36.080 --> 3:57:41.520]  If you go to infowars.com, only on those audio streams and prisonplanet.tv on the video,
[3:57:41.520 --> 3:57:45.440]  we're going to continue with an addendum, not just the anthrax attacks, but who they
[3:57:45.440 --> 3:57:51.960]  are, the mindset that allows them to engage in this type of behavior.
[3:57:51.960 --> 3:57:57.480]  And so, again, you need to go to one place, infowars.com, to click on those streams right
[3:57:57.480 --> 3:57:59.880]  now with Dr. Boyle.
[3:57:59.880 --> 3:58:04.400]  Don't forget my new film, Fabled Enemies, that I produced, the Jason Bermas is directed,
[3:58:04.400 --> 3:58:08.560]  you can pre-order it now, it comes out in 10 days, infowars.com as well.
[3:58:08.560 --> 3:58:12.160]  Great job everybody, stay with us, infowars.com.
[3:58:12.160 --> 3:58:13.160]  Thank you for this.
[3:58:13.160 --> 3:58:14.160]  You want to talk to the guest?
[3:58:14.160 --> 3:58:19.400]  No, I'm going to say bye to you and I am just going to, well, I need to go ahead and
[3:58:19.400 --> 3:58:24.160]  allow them to engage in this type of behavior.
[3:58:24.160 --> 3:58:29.640]  And so, again, you need to go to one place, infowars.com, to click on those streams right
[3:58:29.640 --> 3:58:32.040]  now with Dr. Boyle.
[3:58:32.040 --> 3:58:36.600]  Don't forget my new film, Fabled Enemies, that I produced, the Jason Bermas is directed,
[3:58:36.600 --> 3:58:40.880]  you can pre-order it now, it comes out in 10 days, infowars.com.
[3:58:40.880 --> 3:58:41.880]  Go ahead.
[3:58:41.880 --> 3:58:44.640]  Dr. Boyle, we're going to call you back in one minute.
[3:58:44.640 --> 3:58:57.700]  It's a day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[3:58:57.700 --> 3:58:59.200]  against this country.
[3:58:59.200 --> 3:59:03.720]  The enemies here, in the next few minutes, thank you John, you can go ahead and disconnect.
[3:59:03.720 --> 3:59:04.720]  Alright, take care.
[3:59:04.720 --> 3:59:09.320]  Yeah, I decided in the last minute to go to extra transmission, so things are a bit bumpy
[3:59:09.320 --> 3:59:13.720]  here, ladies and gentlemen, not too bumpy, they're just real, because I didn't want
[3:59:13.720 --> 3:59:17.560]  to cut him off of what he was saying, and that's the great luxury, I mean, are we talking
[3:59:17.560 --> 3:59:21.680]  to 2 million people right now in the M&F, and 60 plus affiliates, no, are we on the global
[3:59:21.680 --> 3:59:26.840]  shortwave and satellite, no, but we've got tens of thousands listening on the Internet,
[3:59:26.840 --> 3:59:30.920]  on the streams, and a lot of people watching at PrismPlanet.tv, and this will be magnified
[3:59:30.920 --> 3:59:34.640]  on the web later when people post it on YouTube and all the other sites.
[3:59:34.640 --> 3:59:41.000]  I would also encourage listeners, there's a lot of other up and coming video sites,
[3:59:41.000 --> 3:59:44.800]  like JustinTV and a lot of others I've been seeing, folks should take these clips and
[3:59:44.800 --> 3:59:50.360]  put those up there too, not just YouTube, because YouTube is starting to censor a lot
[3:59:50.360 --> 3:59:51.360]  more.
[3:59:51.360 --> 3:59:54.840]  Though it's the biggest community, and it's where you can reach more people and have
[3:59:54.840 --> 4:00:00.080]  more viral videos, posts there and on MySpaceVideos too, but then also duplicate it if you have
[4:00:00.080 --> 4:00:04.640]  the time, put some of these key clips on some of these other big up and coming video services
[4:00:04.640 --> 4:00:08.880]  that also have millions tuning into them and watching them, not hundreds of millions or
[4:00:08.880 --> 4:00:14.320]  billions like YouTube, hundreds of millions every day, every week, but billions total
[4:00:14.320 --> 4:00:15.320]  on YouTube.
[4:00:15.320 --> 4:00:20.280]  So that's still the key areas, but attack in that area, and also get into all of the
[4:00:20.280 --> 4:00:21.440]  other areas of the web.
[4:00:21.440 --> 4:00:23.240]  We're ready to go to Dr. Boyle.
[4:00:23.240 --> 4:00:27.160]  Okay, Dr. Boyle, I'm only going to keep you for T-minus 10 minutes.
[4:00:27.160 --> 4:00:32.160]  You have the floor completely, talk about your PhD with these guys, the mindsets being
[4:00:32.160 --> 4:00:37.760]  around them, this cold-blooded divorce from reality, divorce from conscience, this might
[4:00:37.760 --> 4:00:46.640]  make right survival of the fittest, this Nazi-type or Malthusian amalgamation that we're facing
[4:00:46.640 --> 4:00:47.640]  right now.
[4:00:47.640 --> 4:00:48.640]  Right.
[4:00:48.640 --> 4:00:53.680]  Well, as I was saying, I was trained to be a Neal conservative at the University of Chicago
[4:00:53.680 --> 4:01:00.360]  by Strauss's co-author and literary executor later, Joseph Cropsey.
[4:01:00.360 --> 4:01:06.320]  Strauss had just retired when I showed up there, but I went through the exact same program
[4:01:06.320 --> 4:01:11.160]  that produced all these Neal conservatives, and there are two books on them if you're
[4:01:11.160 --> 4:01:18.440]  interested by Professor Shadia Drury, D-R-U-R-Y, Leo Strauss and the American Right, and the
[4:01:18.440 --> 4:01:21.400]  political ideas of Leo Strauss.
[4:01:21.400 --> 4:01:27.120]  Professor Drury teaches political philosophy up in Canada, and she, to the best of my knowledge,
[4:01:27.120 --> 4:01:32.680]  she was never trained at the University of Chicago as I was, but I agree with everything
[4:01:32.680 --> 4:01:38.800]  Professor Drury says, these people are neo-Nazis.
[4:01:38.800 --> 4:01:44.960]  That comes directly from Strauss, who was trained by Schmidt, who was a Nazi.
[4:01:44.960 --> 4:01:50.160]  We still don't know why Schmidt was never prosecuted at Nuremberg or any of the subsequent
[4:01:50.160 --> 4:01:56.360]  proceedings influenced by Machiavelli, by Nietzsche, and Hobbes.
[4:01:56.360 --> 4:01:59.360]  Those are the main influences on the Neal conservatives.
[4:01:59.360 --> 4:02:05.800]  And then from there, I went to Harvard to get my PhD, and certainly don't send your
[4:02:05.800 --> 4:02:09.160]  children to the University of Chicago for any reason.
[4:02:09.160 --> 4:02:12.960]  They will simply brainwash them to become Neal conservatives.
[4:02:12.960 --> 4:02:18.560]  And then I went to Harvard to get my PhD in political science in the same program that
[4:02:18.560 --> 4:02:24.840]  produced Kissinger, Brzezinski, Huntington, and all the rest of these people.
[4:02:24.840 --> 4:02:35.520]  So again, more of the same type of Machiavellian-Hobbes thought, although not as direct a connection
[4:02:35.520 --> 4:02:40.920]  to Schmidt as the University of Chicago was.
[4:02:40.920 --> 4:02:49.320]  So these people are very bright, completely ruthless, unprincipled, and motivated by a
[4:02:49.320 --> 4:02:51.840]  Nazi-type philosophy.
[4:02:51.840 --> 4:02:56.360]  There's no other word to describe it, in my opinion.
[4:02:56.360 --> 4:03:02.640]  Continue, sir, I'm sitting back, listening to you.
[4:03:02.640 --> 4:03:08.920]  Well, you know, if you want to get a PhD in political science at Harvard, you have to
[4:03:08.920 --> 4:03:14.040]  know your Machiavelli backward forward, upside down, and in your sleep and by row.
[4:03:14.040 --> 4:03:21.000]  So that should give you a pretty good idea of Kissinger, a Machiavellian to the core,
[4:03:21.000 --> 4:03:23.200]  Brzezinski as well.
[4:03:23.200 --> 4:03:30.560]  As I said, people like Wilcovich, Chalabi, Kalilzd, Schulski, and the Neocons from Chicago.
[4:03:30.560 --> 4:03:36.280]  For that, you'd have to read Machiavelli-Hobbes and Nietzsche as well.
[4:03:36.280 --> 4:03:47.480]  And so many of the Neoconservatives today, both in the government, in academia, these
[4:03:47.480 --> 4:03:55.400]  news media pundits that get quoted, have all been trained in the same system.
[4:03:55.400 --> 4:04:02.520]  Alan Keyes, classmate of mine at Harvard, studied with Harvey Mansfield at Straussian.
[4:04:02.520 --> 4:04:08.320]  I could go on with Elizabeth Fukuyama, another Neoconservative.
[4:04:08.320 --> 4:04:16.920]  He wrote a review of Max Weber's The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism for the
[4:04:16.920 --> 4:04:19.280]  Sunday New York Times book review.
[4:04:19.280 --> 4:04:23.960]  They gave him the entire back page to do this on the 100th anniversary.
[4:04:23.960 --> 4:04:28.800]  And he analogized Weber to Carl Schmidt.
[4:04:28.800 --> 4:04:33.960]  And he didn't bother to mention anyone in this review that Schmidt was a Nazi.
[4:04:33.960 --> 4:04:40.680]  Indeed, it apparently did not matter to the New York Times that Fukuyama was referring
[4:04:40.680 --> 4:04:46.880]  to Schmidt the Nazi favorably without identifying as a Nazi, because the Sunday New York Times
[4:04:46.880 --> 4:04:51.680]  book review editor was a Neoconservative himself.
[4:04:51.680 --> 4:04:59.360]  And many of the people there at the New York Times, like Brooks, went through that program
[4:04:59.360 --> 4:05:00.960]  at the University of Chicago.
[4:05:00.960 --> 4:05:01.960]  Well, they see...
[4:05:01.960 --> 4:05:08.400]  Crystal, who studied on the New York Times, he studied with Harvey Mansfield at Straussian,
[4:05:08.400 --> 4:05:10.160]  Neoconservative at Harvard.
[4:05:10.160 --> 4:05:16.200]  So it's a very dangerous and incestuous situation.
[4:05:16.200 --> 4:05:24.280]  Bush himself made a speech at the American Enterprise Institute where he bragged that
[4:05:24.280 --> 4:05:32.960]  he had hired, I think it was somewhere between 20 and 25 Straussians in his administration.
[4:05:32.960 --> 4:05:39.920]  So all these people work in accordance with this neo-Nazi philosophy.
[4:05:39.920 --> 4:05:45.600]  So it doesn't surprise me that you would see the anthrax attack or anything else they're
[4:05:45.600 --> 4:05:46.600]  doing.
[4:05:46.600 --> 4:05:47.600]  They will stop at nothing.
[4:05:47.600 --> 4:05:52.560]  Well, they've said, we have power, we've got to maximize it, we've got to go for everything.
[4:05:52.560 --> 4:05:57.360]  And they totally control McCain, Barack Obama's controlled by a lot of the same people.
[4:05:57.360 --> 4:06:00.040]  Do you even see them giving up power?
[4:06:00.040 --> 4:06:01.840]  I don't think they want to, that's right.
[4:06:01.840 --> 4:06:02.840]  I think they want...
[4:06:02.840 --> 4:06:08.080]  You know, all the Neoconservatives now are working for McCain.
[4:06:08.080 --> 4:06:13.360]  This Randy Schooniman, his top foreign affairs advisor, was a director of the project for
[4:06:13.360 --> 4:06:19.200]  the New American Century, I'm sure your listeners know all about PNEC and what they're about.
[4:06:19.200 --> 4:06:24.040]  He was just until recently a lobbyist for Georgia.
[4:06:24.040 --> 4:06:27.680]  So they've all congregated around McCain and they're going to be...
[4:06:27.680 --> 4:06:34.520]  Let's briefly talk about that, George, I mean, is that another manifestation of their arrogance
[4:06:34.520 --> 4:06:38.400]  and why do we see so many Israelis picking up a Straussian view?
[4:06:38.400 --> 4:06:44.240]  I mean, they just believe in the philosophy of the Nazis, it's not even a racial thing,
[4:06:44.240 --> 4:06:46.480]  is it, per se, Aryan race?
[4:06:46.480 --> 4:06:50.640]  It's the system and the ideals of governing, correct?
[4:06:50.640 --> 4:07:01.640]  I think that's correct, that there was collaboration between the earlier Zionists and the Nazi regime
[4:07:01.640 --> 4:07:05.960]  to try to get Jews into Palestine.
[4:07:05.960 --> 4:07:13.320]  Ronnie Brenner has a book on that, if you want to read the correspondence itself.
[4:07:13.320 --> 4:07:22.160]  But in any event, yes, to get back to Georgia, even today, the Financial Times, the deputy
[4:07:22.160 --> 4:07:29.760]  defense minister of Georgia, admitted that when they attacked South Estonia, he noticed
[4:07:29.760 --> 4:07:30.760]  he's...
[4:07:30.760 --> 4:07:31.760]  This is a...
[4:07:31.760 --> 4:07:33.640]  He's incriminating himself here in aggression.
[4:07:33.640 --> 4:07:40.800]  This is in today's Financial Times, he said, but he didn't believe Russia would respond.
[4:07:40.800 --> 4:07:45.160]  But he's admitting that, yes, they unleashed the attack on South Estonia.
[4:07:45.160 --> 4:07:48.720]  Oh, that's huge news, I wasn't aware of that, give me the name of the story?
[4:07:48.720 --> 4:07:55.320]  It just came through Financial Times to bill the admits, miscalculating Russian reaction.
[4:07:55.320 --> 4:07:56.320]  Oh, my goodness.
[4:07:56.320 --> 4:08:01.960]  The deputy defense minister admitted it, that they launched the attack on South Estonia.
[4:08:01.960 --> 4:08:07.480]  Now, we have to understand that attack would not have been launched without the approval
[4:08:07.480 --> 4:08:08.480]  of the Bush administration.
[4:08:08.480 --> 4:08:10.320]  Well, we also don't just have neocons in NATO.
[4:08:10.320 --> 4:08:15.400]  We have the defense minister being Israeli, not even Georgian, their foreign minister.
[4:08:15.400 --> 4:08:20.080]  And the fact that they thought Russia wouldn't respond to a deadly sneak attack, and then
[4:08:20.080 --> 4:08:24.560]  now they're moving more missile systems in, they've yesterday kicked the ambassadors to
[4:08:24.560 --> 4:08:31.360]  NATO of Russia out, they didn't even do that after World War II and then into the Cuban
[4:08:31.360 --> 4:08:32.360]  missile crisis.
[4:08:32.360 --> 4:08:36.680]  I mean, this is getting to be unprecedented and they're saying Russia will pay, Cheney
[4:08:36.680 --> 4:08:41.160]  made statements about, he called the Russian president up and said, there will be a response
[4:08:41.160 --> 4:08:43.160]  to this and slam the phone down.
[4:08:43.160 --> 4:08:44.320]  That was in the mainstream news.
[4:08:44.320 --> 4:08:49.080]  I mean, it's scary when you get these type of nuts, I know they're very smart and controlled
[4:08:49.080 --> 4:08:54.560]  psychopaths, but at the same time, and they've codified it into a political science to give
[4:08:54.560 --> 4:08:57.560]  it some type of intellectual cover, they believe.
[4:08:57.560 --> 4:09:01.400]  So when you've got Carl Rove walking around saying, we control reality to newspaper writers
[4:09:01.400 --> 4:09:06.280]  and you will just report on the new reality we give you, I mean, we see this psychology,
[4:09:06.280 --> 4:09:08.480]  do you believe that they've gone into megalomania?
[4:09:08.480 --> 4:09:15.640]  Well, this is consistent with the, these people are sociopaths, you know, that's a regular
[4:09:15.640 --> 4:09:25.080]  position, you know, psychologist, psychiatrist, whatever, they function that way.
[4:09:25.080 --> 4:09:33.680]  But yeah, it's part of the neoconservative strategy here to basically resume a Cold War
[4:09:33.680 --> 4:09:41.120]  with Russia as they had against the Soviet Union, figuring that, you know, the best way
[4:09:41.120 --> 4:09:44.160]  to deal with them is to destroy them if they can't.
[4:09:44.160 --> 4:09:53.920]  So we've seen the, this promiscuous expansion of NATO right up to the border of Russia,
[4:09:53.920 --> 4:09:59.080]  despite the fact that when the Soviet Union collapsed, the Warsaw Pact collapsed, there
[4:09:59.080 --> 4:10:02.200]  was no reason at all for NATO to be around.
[4:10:02.200 --> 4:10:09.840]  Indeed, what happened was then the Bush Senior Administration, instead of dissolving NATO,
[4:10:09.840 --> 4:10:12.640]  decided to give NATO two new purposes.
[4:10:12.640 --> 4:10:16.760]  One, policing Eastern Europe, control and domination of Eastern Europe.
[4:10:16.760 --> 4:10:21.120]  And their first snack was funding people to attack the Serbs and start all that going.
[4:10:21.120 --> 4:10:27.240]  The opening shot of this was the war against Serbia, the bombing campaign against Serbia.
[4:10:27.240 --> 4:10:32.880]  Was this to be another snack, you know, to give that military system something to do?
[4:10:32.880 --> 4:10:35.640]  And obviously they thought the Russians wouldn't do what they've now done.
[4:10:35.640 --> 4:10:37.640]  Is this a big defeat of the neocons?
[4:10:37.640 --> 4:10:44.080]  And do you think this will generate more anger by them to have an outgoing victory?
[4:10:44.080 --> 4:10:49.680]  Well, I think they knew how the Russians would respond, because there were also reports
[4:10:49.680 --> 4:10:54.960]  of a large-scale Russian buildup in Russia, right over the border.
[4:10:54.960 --> 4:10:59.320]  So they fooled the Georgians and gave them bad intelligence?
[4:10:59.320 --> 4:11:01.200]  Well, they ordered the Georgians in there.
[4:11:01.200 --> 4:11:06.080]  I mean, the Georgian army is a subsidiary of the Pentagon and the Israeli Ministry of
[4:11:06.080 --> 4:11:07.080]  Defense.
[4:11:07.080 --> 4:11:09.800]  We've armed the clip, applied, trained these people.
[4:11:09.800 --> 4:11:10.800]  So I think...
[4:11:10.800 --> 4:11:16.680]  So this is meant to be an opening salvo in a new cold slash hot rush fire war.
[4:11:16.680 --> 4:11:20.440]  I believe so, at least a new cold war as they see it.
[4:11:20.440 --> 4:11:28.720]  And then immediately they rammed through the missile agreement with Poland.
[4:11:28.720 --> 4:11:32.560]  All along they had said, oh, well, this has nothing to do with Russia.
[4:11:32.560 --> 4:11:39.800]  But then they capitalized on the vilification of Russia to ram this thing through, and everyone's
[4:11:39.800 --> 4:11:40.800]  supporting it.
[4:11:40.800 --> 4:11:47.200]  It's part of the neocon strategy to resume the cold war with Russia, and if it risks
[4:11:47.200 --> 4:11:49.320]  getting hot, then so be it.
[4:11:49.320 --> 4:11:52.480]  And this leads us into rack and ruin.
[4:11:52.480 --> 4:11:55.360]  We hear the neocons are losing power and stalling.
[4:11:55.360 --> 4:11:58.520]  And I mean, what other elites are swarming around this new world order?
[4:11:58.520 --> 4:12:01.800]  Where do you see this going and closing?
[4:12:01.800 --> 4:12:02.800]  Well, it doesn't look very good.
[4:12:02.800 --> 4:12:10.280]  I think they're going to go all out to get McCain elected and continue the neocon agenda
[4:12:10.280 --> 4:12:12.760]  for another four to eight years.
[4:12:12.760 --> 4:12:14.320]  I'm a political independent.
[4:12:14.320 --> 4:12:18.320]  I'm not here trying to endorse Obama one way or the other.
[4:12:18.320 --> 4:12:21.960]  Just tell you the situation as I see it.
[4:12:21.960 --> 4:12:30.000]  And if that means provoking this crisis with Russia, and notice McCain has already shot
[4:12:30.000 --> 4:12:33.600]  up in the polls and has now come even if not ahead.
[4:12:33.600 --> 4:12:35.080]  We had his advisor a month ago.
[4:12:35.080 --> 4:12:40.160]  We had his advisor a month ago, McCain, say a new war would help McCain or a new 9-11.
[4:12:40.160 --> 4:12:41.160]  Wallah.
[4:12:41.160 --> 4:12:42.680]  That's correct.
[4:12:42.680 --> 4:12:49.600]  And remember, Carl Rove has already said on the 2002 campaign on the crisis against
[4:12:49.600 --> 4:12:52.600]  Iraq, you don't bring out a new product in August.
[4:12:52.600 --> 4:13:00.080]  Well, they did, but it's clear that all this is being orchestrated and in my opinion, very
[4:13:00.080 --> 4:13:09.200]  carefully with the McCain campaign to play to his strong suits as he sees it on defense
[4:13:09.200 --> 4:13:13.880]  and foreign affairs and Obama struggling to keep up.
[4:13:13.880 --> 4:13:21.160]  And indeed, on Georgia, Obama has become almost as bad as McCain.
[4:13:21.160 --> 4:13:29.520]  Indeed, his top foreign affairs advisor on Russia is a guy named McFall from the Hoover
[4:13:29.520 --> 4:13:33.920]  Institute out in Palo Alto.
[4:13:33.920 --> 4:13:41.200]  And the Hoover Institute is a well-known haven for neo-conservatives and right-wingers.
[4:13:41.200 --> 4:13:49.280]  So you even have the Russian policies of Obama being determined by one of these people,
[4:13:49.280 --> 4:13:50.280]  Brzezinski.
[4:13:50.280 --> 4:13:56.400]  Again, I went to the same PhD program at Harvard that produced Brzezinski.
[4:13:56.400 --> 4:14:01.440]  You know, he's made highly belligerent statements and compared Putin to Hitler.
[4:14:01.440 --> 4:14:07.520]  Yeah, and we've got Brzezinski advising Obama and Brzezinski advising McCain.
[4:14:07.520 --> 4:14:14.680]  Well, again, we have problems also in the Obama camp as well.
[4:14:14.680 --> 4:14:19.720]  There are some, I guess you'd say, people who are more liberal there.
[4:14:19.720 --> 4:14:22.960]  But the McCain campaign is fully neo-conservative.
[4:14:22.960 --> 4:14:32.200]  We would simply see a continuation and indeed an intensification of the Bush policies that
[4:14:32.200 --> 4:14:38.400]  have been a disaster both at home and abroad in the McCain administration.
[4:14:38.400 --> 4:14:44.760]  His lawyers giving him legal advice and running his legal strategy.
[4:14:44.760 --> 4:14:47.040]  They're all the federal society lawyers.
[4:14:47.040 --> 4:14:48.640]  We discussed that before, I believe.
[4:14:48.640 --> 4:14:49.640]  Absolutely.
[4:14:49.640 --> 4:14:50.640]  I've got to have you back up.
[4:14:50.640 --> 4:14:51.840]  I'm going to let you go here in just a moment.
[4:14:51.840 --> 4:14:55.360]  This is the fungal question.
[4:14:55.360 --> 4:15:02.440]  Looking at all of this, do you think things are going well for them or going badly for
[4:15:02.440 --> 4:15:04.120]  this crop of new world order managers?
[4:15:04.120 --> 4:15:06.640]  I mean, it seems to me a lot of people are waking up.
[4:15:06.640 --> 4:15:08.040]  A lot of people see what's happening.
[4:15:08.040 --> 4:15:12.600]  But then you have them making arrogant statements like it's a joke saying the 21st century nations
[4:15:12.600 --> 4:15:16.160]  don't invade other nations and then even smiling with smart ass looks.
[4:15:16.160 --> 4:15:20.200]  I mean, it's part of their philosophy rubbing it in and being over the top.
[4:15:20.200 --> 4:15:27.080]  Well, I think that we are seeing some desperation on the part of the neocons.
[4:15:27.080 --> 4:15:29.640]  I don't believe they're out of power or anything like that.
[4:15:29.640 --> 4:15:33.960]  There was some reshuffling, but they're still in power.
[4:15:33.960 --> 4:15:41.120]  But the fact that they are taking steps like the anthrax cover up, like what they did in
[4:15:41.120 --> 4:15:49.160]  Georgia, running over there to Poland and getting all of Europe upset, in my mind seems
[4:15:49.160 --> 4:15:55.520]  to indicate they are somewhat desperate and concerned about their position, which I think
[4:15:55.520 --> 4:16:01.360]  does give the rest of the American people an opening to try to stop them.
[4:16:01.360 --> 4:16:02.360]  I agree.
[4:16:02.360 --> 4:16:03.360]  Why are they?
[4:16:03.360 --> 4:16:08.600]  I keep saying last question, but the huge police state, the gearing up, the federalizing
[4:16:08.600 --> 4:16:13.600]  local departments, the secret camps all in the news now, the Democrats greedily voting
[4:16:13.600 --> 4:16:16.160]  for all those programs, you know, they want that power.
[4:16:16.160 --> 4:16:21.440]  I mean, for the real buildup I see against us, when we're servile going along with it
[4:16:21.440 --> 4:16:26.320]  all, what is it they're planning that's so horrible that they're gearing up militarily
[4:16:26.320 --> 4:16:29.240]  with a huge buildup for domestic suppression?
[4:16:29.240 --> 4:16:32.760]  I mean, is it just implosion of the economy through their greed or what?
[4:16:32.760 --> 4:16:36.640]  Well, I think that and also World War III.
[4:16:36.640 --> 4:16:45.400]  I mean, Bush himself, as you know, Putin last October flew to Iran, met with Iranian leaders
[4:16:45.400 --> 4:16:52.640]  and said he did not believe Iran was developing nuclear weapons, whereupon President Bush
[4:16:52.640 --> 4:16:58.360]  then called a press conference and publicly threatened World War III over Iran.
[4:16:58.360 --> 4:17:03.200]  I think the first time, certainly in my lifetime, where anyone has threatened World War III
[4:17:03.200 --> 4:17:09.240]  president publicly, now that threat was not directed at Iran because Iran is incapable
[4:17:09.240 --> 4:17:12.040]  of engaging in a World War III.
[4:17:12.040 --> 4:17:14.040]  It was directed at Russia.
[4:17:14.040 --> 4:17:20.800]  Well, take Mohammed Karzai, they're in a press conference and Bush is talking about
[4:17:20.800 --> 4:17:28.000]  how Iran is with al-Qaida in Afghanistan and of course Karzai knows how bad that plays
[4:17:28.000 --> 4:17:34.600]  to all the satellite TV networks where everyone over there knows the Wahhabis are Sunni, not
[4:17:34.600 --> 4:17:40.520]  Iranian Shiites, and that Iran is against the original organic Al-Caida or al-Qaida.
[4:17:40.520 --> 4:17:45.360]  I mean, that was like saying that, you know, Martin Luther King is Adolf Hitler, it was
[4:17:45.360 --> 4:17:49.760]  just complete opposites, and he said, excuse me, Mr. President, no, Iran is helping us.
[4:17:49.760 --> 4:17:53.200]  And Bush just said, no, they're not, they're with al-Qaida.
[4:17:53.200 --> 4:17:58.520]  And then even before the Senate, McCain a few months ago, the senator said, you know,
[4:17:58.520 --> 4:18:00.160]  isn't it true that Iran's al-Qaida?
[4:18:00.160 --> 4:18:01.160]  And he said, yes, that's true.
[4:18:01.160 --> 4:18:04.640]  I mean, it's just, and they always smile when they do it.
[4:18:04.640 --> 4:18:11.600]  It's just such, such disregard, arrogance, hatred of the public, just one-ton lying.
[4:18:11.600 --> 4:18:15.920]  I mean, it just, I've studied a lot of history, I know you have more so.
[4:18:15.920 --> 4:18:19.840]  I've just never seen something this over the top and shoddy.
[4:18:19.840 --> 4:18:25.120]  I mean, studying propagandists, and even Gerbil said it, you know, the propaganda needs to
[4:18:25.120 --> 4:18:30.640]  be slick, it doesn't need to be too over the top sometimes, or then you get discredited.
[4:18:30.640 --> 4:18:34.760]  It seems like they're going with just a muddy the waters to the point of people.
[4:18:34.760 --> 4:18:37.320]  I mean, it's, there's got to be some method to the madness.
[4:18:37.320 --> 4:18:38.320]  Do you see what I'm saying?
[4:18:38.320 --> 4:18:39.320]  It's just the lies.
[4:18:39.320 --> 4:18:45.560]  Well, there is, and again, today it was just reported on the wire services that the aircraft
[4:18:45.560 --> 4:18:51.680]  carrier task force under the Reagan, and it's all its support ships and some others, are
[4:18:51.680 --> 4:18:55.480]  now moving into place into the Arabian Sea.
[4:18:55.480 --> 4:18:59.400]  They will be arriving there about the third week in October, which will be right before
[4:18:59.400 --> 4:19:00.400]  the election.
[4:19:00.400 --> 4:19:08.480]  So, it does seem to me that there will or very well could be an attack upon Iran either
[4:19:08.480 --> 4:19:12.560]  before the election or after the election.
[4:19:12.560 --> 4:19:19.200]  And that very well could set off a conflict, a direct conflict with Russia.
[4:19:19.200 --> 4:19:26.360]  And it could be that what happened here in Georgia was a faint in order to tie Russia
[4:19:26.360 --> 4:19:34.880]  down in Georgia and vilify everyone against Russia over Georgia while they're preparing
[4:19:34.880 --> 4:19:41.680]  to attack Iran and risk setting off World War III, which President Bush has publicly
[4:19:41.680 --> 4:19:45.160]  stated he is prepared to do with respect to Russia.
[4:19:45.160 --> 4:19:46.160]  God help us.
[4:19:46.160 --> 4:19:47.160]  These people are going for broke.
[4:19:47.160 --> 4:19:50.080]  Well, Dr. Boyle, thank you, plug the book one more time.
[4:19:50.080 --> 4:19:55.760]  Well, they are going for broke, and we also have to understand then that Senator McCain
[4:19:55.760 --> 4:19:59.800]  has said that if there is a World War III, there will be a draft.
[4:19:59.800 --> 4:20:00.800]  Yes.
[4:20:00.800 --> 4:20:05.880]  So that, I think, is why we're also seeing the police state tactics, that they are going
[4:20:05.880 --> 4:20:07.240]  for broke.
[4:20:07.240 --> 4:20:13.920]  And if this does happen, you'll see massive resistance here in the United States of America,
[4:20:13.920 --> 4:20:20.400]  certainly to a draft and a collapsing economy, and they're fully prepared to set up their
[4:20:20.400 --> 4:20:21.400]  police state.
[4:20:21.400 --> 4:20:23.160]  Well, you said it.
[4:20:23.160 --> 4:20:24.480]  Tell us about the book one more time.
[4:20:24.480 --> 4:20:27.720]  Well, the book is Bio-Warfare and Terrorism.
[4:20:27.720 --> 4:20:28.720]  Okay, I want to...
[4:20:28.720 --> 4:20:30.360]  I didn't come out here to plug my book.
[4:20:30.360 --> 4:20:33.080]  I came out here to try to explain...
[4:20:33.080 --> 4:20:34.080]  No, I know, but...
[4:20:34.080 --> 4:20:38.440]  If I see it, I think, you know, the best of my assessment of the situation, what's going
[4:20:38.440 --> 4:20:39.440]  on here.
[4:20:39.440 --> 4:20:41.920]  No, I know you didn't come out to plug your book, but we need to get your book out.
[4:20:41.920 --> 4:20:45.640]  People need to read it, and that's why I keep wanting you to plug it, because people need
[4:20:45.640 --> 4:20:46.640]  to read that.
[4:20:46.640 --> 4:20:49.480]  And I want to get you back up in the next few weeks, because you're such an expert on
[4:20:49.480 --> 4:20:53.240]  all this, and I totally agree with your analysis, sir, and we're just honored to have you.
[4:20:53.240 --> 4:20:54.720]  Thank you so much, Dr. Boyle.
[4:20:54.720 --> 4:21:00.760]  Well, thanks a lot for having me on, and let's everyone out there go out and act upon the
[4:21:00.760 --> 4:21:04.600]  information that they received in the show.
[4:21:04.600 --> 4:21:05.600]  Thank you, sir.
[4:21:05.600 --> 4:21:06.600]  We'll talk to you soon.
[4:21:06.600 --> 4:21:07.600]  All right, thanks.
[4:21:07.600 --> 4:21:08.600]  Bye.
[4:21:08.600 --> 4:21:09.600]  There he goes.
[4:21:09.600 --> 4:21:10.600]  Bring in Burmese police.
[4:21:10.600 --> 4:21:11.960]  So, I want to say bye to Burmese.
[4:21:11.960 --> 4:21:12.960]  I'm about to leave.
[4:21:12.960 --> 4:21:18.720]  I do a few radio interviews tomorrow, and I got ready to gear it up to go to the DNC
[4:21:18.720 --> 4:21:19.720]  and cover that.
[4:21:19.720 --> 4:21:20.880]  You have to do an interview like that.
[4:21:20.880 --> 4:21:21.880]  It just freaks you out.
[4:21:21.880 --> 4:21:25.320]  I mean, these people are just psychopathic starting World War III.
[4:21:25.320 --> 4:21:28.320]  They're pure evil, and I know they set up martial law.
[4:21:28.320 --> 4:21:31.160]  I'm on a hit list, and they're just bastards, man.
[4:21:31.160 --> 4:21:35.320]  I just, I can't believe we have psychopathic demons running things, and the public's running
[4:21:35.320 --> 4:21:41.440]  around fornicating in the streets, but we got good people like Burmese, and he's going
[4:21:41.440 --> 4:21:46.080]  to be here, he's going to be here in town tomorrow.
[4:21:46.080 --> 4:21:48.960]  You're doing the Sunday show, and you're doing the show next week when I'm in Denver
[4:21:48.960 --> 4:21:55.640]  with live Collins and the rest of it, so Burmese, coming up next tomorrow and next week, what
[4:21:55.640 --> 4:21:57.560]  do we have to look forward to from you?
[4:21:57.560 --> 4:21:59.120]  We've got Gage, I think, tomorrow.
[4:21:59.120 --> 4:22:00.960]  I think we have Ryan on Monday.
[4:22:00.960 --> 4:22:05.320]  We're also going to be really picking apart this new World Trade Center 7 NIST report,
[4:22:05.320 --> 4:22:06.320]  obviously.
[4:22:06.320 --> 4:22:10.240]  All week at the DNC, we're going to have updates from yourself, Luke Radowski, and Jonathan
[4:22:10.240 --> 4:22:15.840]  from We Are Change Colorado, and of course, I'm going to be playing more teasers and trailers
[4:22:15.840 --> 4:22:19.960]  of the new film, Fabled Enemies, before it's released on September 1st, a little early
[4:22:19.960 --> 4:22:26.240]  for the PrismPlanet.tv subscribers on August 31st, but I've got a lot to do, and I just
[4:22:26.240 --> 4:22:29.840]  want to take this opportunity to thank you so much, Alex, for everything you've done
[4:22:29.840 --> 4:22:32.320]  for me, and allowing me.
[4:22:32.320 --> 4:22:34.120]  Hey, a trade just came in.
[4:22:34.120 --> 4:22:35.120]  Let's bring Tray in.
[4:22:35.120 --> 4:22:36.120]  Do you want to get on camera, Tray?
[4:22:36.120 --> 4:22:37.120]  Benjamin Fulford tomorrow.
[4:22:37.120 --> 4:22:42.640]  That's right, Benjamin Fulford of X-Forbes Magazine Editor, he's the one that got that
[4:22:42.640 --> 4:22:43.640]  Rockefeller interview.
[4:22:43.640 --> 4:22:44.640]  That'll be crazy.
[4:22:44.640 --> 4:22:46.080]  I'm right out of Japan.
[4:22:46.080 --> 4:22:47.080]  It should be interesting.
[4:22:47.080 --> 4:22:48.080]  I mean, I'm looking forward to it.
[4:22:48.080 --> 4:22:51.920]  You know, I'm open to other people, but anyway, you know, again, I want to just thank you
[4:22:51.920 --> 4:22:56.040]  for giving me the opportunity to come out here to make this other 9-11 film that a lot
[4:22:56.040 --> 4:23:00.040]  of people said that I didn't want to make or I was trying to cover up.
[4:23:00.040 --> 4:23:02.520]  So, you know, without you, I don't think Fabled Enemies could have been possible.
[4:23:02.520 --> 4:23:03.520]  Well, you've been with The Loose.
[4:23:03.520 --> 4:23:05.360]  The Loose changes only three years old, the original one.
[4:23:05.360 --> 4:23:06.520]  You've been involved with them two years.
[4:23:06.520 --> 4:23:07.520]  I mean, this is...
[4:23:07.520 --> 4:23:08.920]  A little bit, like three this summer.
[4:23:08.920 --> 4:23:09.920]  Yeah, yeah.
[4:23:09.920 --> 4:23:10.920]  So, well, okay.
[4:23:10.920 --> 4:23:11.920]  Give me the proper time for it.
[4:23:11.920 --> 4:23:12.920]  Yeah.
[4:23:12.920 --> 4:23:13.920]  I think it was three this summer.
[4:23:13.920 --> 4:23:14.920]  I think it was three this summer of 05.
[4:23:14.920 --> 4:23:18.480]  So, that's when I started to get involved, basically, that week.
[4:23:18.480 --> 4:23:21.160]  And I've been on this roller coaster ever since, and I've been, you know, researching
[4:23:21.160 --> 4:23:23.800]  since 2002, about six months after the attack.
[4:23:23.800 --> 4:23:24.800]  You know, I just...
[4:23:24.800 --> 4:23:26.000]  First video you saw was Road to Tyranny, right?
[4:23:26.000 --> 4:23:27.560]  Oh, first video that really scared me.
[4:23:27.560 --> 4:23:28.560]  You bet.
[4:23:28.560 --> 4:23:29.560]  That was...
[4:23:29.560 --> 4:23:33.200]  You know, I'd been researching 9-11 for probably about six weeks to two months, and I just
[4:23:33.200 --> 4:23:34.200]  want to know more and more.
[4:23:34.200 --> 4:23:39.720]  And I come across this guy named Alex Jones, and I find this 77-megabyte real media file,
[4:23:39.720 --> 4:23:43.880]  just totally choppy, audio is at a sink by like 20 seconds or whatever.
[4:23:43.880 --> 4:23:46.560]  And me and my roommate sat down and watched it, and I didn't want to do anything more
[4:23:46.560 --> 4:23:49.960]  than to prove you wrong on just about anything, and I wasn't able to do it.
[4:23:49.960 --> 4:23:54.120]  I was able to verify your information, and it really led me on this path to find out
[4:23:54.120 --> 4:23:55.120]  all the other stuff you talked about.
[4:23:55.120 --> 4:23:57.280]  And now your name's on an extermination list.
[4:23:57.280 --> 4:23:58.280]  Awesome.
[4:23:58.280 --> 4:24:01.480]  Well, I'm willing to have my name on that list because, you know, it's just like I say,
[4:24:01.480 --> 4:24:02.960]  if I'm not free and you're not free.
[4:24:02.960 --> 4:24:07.400]  No, I mean, we have murdering monster terrorist who put poison in vaccines that kill kids.
[4:24:07.400 --> 4:24:08.400]  I've had it, man.
[4:24:08.400 --> 4:24:09.640]  I've had it with you killing.
[4:24:09.640 --> 4:24:11.080]  I'm sick of you, Filth.
[4:24:11.080 --> 4:24:14.000]  We're going to bring you to justice, and Burmese, you're going to be sitting in this
[4:24:14.000 --> 4:24:15.000]  whole week.
[4:24:15.000 --> 4:24:19.440]  We're going to cut now into retransmission from today's show with all those huge guests
[4:24:19.440 --> 4:24:22.840]  that we had on.
[4:24:22.840 --> 4:24:26.040]  Great interview with Resist Manifesto, Mark Dice.
[4:24:26.040 --> 4:24:33.240]  We had our InfoWars reporter, Shane Geiger, who got into the NIST deal and made a stink
[4:24:33.240 --> 4:24:34.320]  and got shut down.
[4:24:34.320 --> 4:24:35.840]  From Texas to Maryland, Alex.
[4:24:35.840 --> 4:24:37.480]  And they turned the lights off on him.
[4:24:37.480 --> 4:24:38.480]  So that's coming up.
[4:24:38.480 --> 4:24:41.960]  We're going to cut into a rebroadcast where I was taking phone calls right now, and Burmese
[4:24:41.960 --> 4:24:45.560]  will be back live tomorrow, 11 to 3, and then Sunday, 4 to 6.
[4:24:45.560 --> 4:24:49.080]  He is a great guy, and we appreciate him, and pre-order fabled enemies now.
[4:24:49.080 --> 4:24:52.560]  It's going to be shipping in 10 days, the new film, and don't forget it'll be up on
[4:24:52.560 --> 4:24:53.560]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[4:24:53.560 --> 4:24:55.480]  Burmese deserves this film to be big.
[4:24:55.480 --> 4:24:59.920]  It's important, and it covers the really dangerous subjects of 9-11.
[4:24:59.920 --> 4:25:00.920]  Thank you for coming in, Burmese.
[4:25:00.920 --> 4:25:07.920]  Thank you.
