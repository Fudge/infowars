[00:00.000 --> 00:11.480]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.480 --> 00:19.040]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.040 --> 00:30.800]  Texas Alex Jones we're live ladies and gentlemen it is Tuesday the 31st day of
[00:30.800 --> 00:36.320]  August 2010 I hadn't had him on in years but I found it to be very informative
[00:36.320 --> 00:40.640]  and thought-provoking so we had him on last week Joel Scalson World Affairs
[00:40.640 --> 00:46.320]  brief he'll be joining us in the second and third hour today and we're going to
[00:46.320 --> 00:50.480]  have open phones with Joel Scalson joining us in the meantime we'll be
[00:50.480 --> 00:54.680]  covering all this important news like this headline of the London telegraph
[00:54.680 --> 01:05.400]  today Afghanistan bomb attacks killed 21 US soldiers in 48 hours 21 American
[01:05.400 --> 01:08.960]  troops have been killed in Afghanistan since Friday and one of the bloodiest
[01:08.960 --> 01:15.040]  periods of the summer so that situation over there is deteriorating very very
[01:15.040 --> 01:19.840]  quickly and of course there's more violence now popping up in Iraq why
[01:19.840 --> 01:24.720]  are we in these countries well not for the reasons you're told on the news for
[01:24.720 --> 01:30.920]  WMDs or then to spread democracy or to free the women women were the majority
[01:30.920 --> 01:36.760]  of college graduates and new doctors in Iraq and now most women have to wear the
[01:36.760 --> 01:42.480]  burkas and that's because the globalists like to put radical Islamist in power
[01:42.480 --> 01:47.360]  they don't want First World Arab and Muslim countries and that's the big
[01:47.360 --> 01:51.400]  dirty secret who do the Rockefellers the Ford Foundation fund they fund the
[01:51.400 --> 01:56.920]  low reconquista you know pick up your machete Robert Rodriguez they fund the
[01:56.920 --> 02:01.480]  radical Muslims they have been caught funding the white supremacist they've
[02:01.480 --> 02:07.440]  been caught funding every sectarian group pushing division and war and
[02:07.440 --> 02:12.320]  conflict so then the government in the media can play the part of the Arbiter
[02:12.320 --> 02:17.320]  the referee the good guy oh look at all the violence look at all the
[02:17.320 --> 02:22.600]  sectarian violence look at the radical Muslims look at the low reconquista look
[02:22.600 --> 02:26.960]  at all the border problems we've got to come in with the North American Union to
[02:26.960 --> 02:33.880]  fix all of these problems we'll be covering some of that today also I
[02:33.880 --> 02:41.800]  wondered this morning while woke up got on the computer at about 7 a.m. and saw
[02:41.800 --> 02:45.880]  that the drudge report had linked to to just a YouTube video that we'd posted
[02:45.880 --> 02:52.440]  that we'd linked to with this headline satellite spy satellite used on
[02:52.440 --> 02:57.320]  American citizens all Americans should have great pride and of course we love
[02:57.320 --> 03:00.040]  the drudge report I love the drudge report many years ago before they
[03:00.040 --> 03:04.680]  started linking to us every week because I noticed that he was breaking the mold
[03:04.680 --> 03:10.000]  in what you could call crossover alternative mainstream media millions of
[03:10.000 --> 03:14.400]  visitors a day probably the permanent news site period in the world if you had
[03:14.400 --> 03:20.520]  to pick one it's drudge report and he would link to BBC and foreign
[03:20.520 --> 03:26.840]  publications admitting world government and so that through Limbaugh and Beck
[03:26.840 --> 03:30.480]  and Hannity for a loop to where they've had to come out and admit okay there is a
[03:30.480 --> 03:36.080]  world government but you're still a kook if you criticize it you know it's a
[03:36.080 --> 03:39.640]  commie new world order it's not run by the big banks that own the Republicans in
[03:39.640 --> 03:43.400]  the Democrats so I was pleased to see that new link today and I wondered why
[03:43.400 --> 03:48.000]  he pulled it down and I found out why the video was about three and a half
[03:48.000 --> 03:53.200]  years old and again a listener just sent it to us it's been freshly posted up
[03:53.200 --> 04:00.880]  on YouTube but but that spurred me to think about something even more
[04:00.880 --> 04:04.680]  important we see this three and a half year old clip from Homeland Security
[04:04.680 --> 04:08.960]  back in 2007 when they were announcing oh we're gonna watch you with spy
[04:08.960 --> 04:15.200]  satellites to stop al-Qaeda and then now the reason this is back in the news and
[04:15.200 --> 04:19.360]  Steve Watson carton ammo and Paul Watson have written about it in the last few
[04:19.360 --> 04:24.120]  weeks is they're saying oh we're using the spy satellites and we're gonna use it
[04:24.120 --> 04:28.000]  to watch your farms your ranches we're gonna use it to make sure you don't build
[04:28.000 --> 04:34.080]  a shed or work shed or barn on your property under zoning they're getting
[04:34.080 --> 04:39.840]  rid of all the pretense that it's for shadowy neanderthals in caves that want
[04:39.840 --> 04:45.560]  to drink our blood and so I'm glad we posted this but but we're writing a new
[04:45.560 --> 04:50.760]  article to explain here they are three years ago saying it's for terrorism and
[04:50.760 --> 04:54.960]  then three and a half years later they're saying oh no it's for you the

[08:14.680 --> 08:21.400]  it is Tuesday the 31st day of August 2010 as I said in the last segment Joel

[08:25.760 --> 08:29.720]  last week and it just wasn't enough time to go over all of my questions that I

[08:43.040 --> 08:57.280]  1-800-259-9231 will get you up and on the air okay first thing I want to do is
[08:57.280 --> 09:01.040]  play this clip from three and a half years ago because I saw this when I was
[09:01.040 --> 09:04.760]  surfing around the web last week that had been reposted and I meant to get to
[09:04.760 --> 09:11.480]  it but I want to cover this issue now before I get into 21 US soldiers killed
[09:11.480 --> 09:15.200]  in the last 48 hours before I get into the latest economic information
[09:15.200 --> 09:22.880]  Bloomberg has the headline gold rallying to 1,500 as Soros bubble inflates
[09:22.880 --> 09:27.960]  that is all coming up in this hour and your phone calls but I wanted to play
[09:27.960 --> 09:31.960]  this clip with one of the deputy directors of Homeland Security three and
[09:31.960 --> 09:40.280]  a half years ago saying Americans should be proud of the fact that NSA and
[09:40.280 --> 09:46.160]  Pentagon satellites are being used to surveil the American people now when
[09:46.160 --> 09:52.240]  they announced this back in 2007 there was a big uproar and a lot of federal
[09:52.240 --> 09:56.720]  judges said that's completely illegal that was the same time that the warrantless
[09:56.720 --> 10:00.520]  wiretapping was coming out that was illegal and the torture was coming out
[10:00.520 --> 10:06.040]  that was illegal and so they backed off and said okay we're not going to have
[10:06.040 --> 10:10.360]  local police basically federalized in the fusion centers surveilling everyone
[10:10.360 --> 10:15.320]  but they went ahead with the training and did it this is in Greece Australia the
[10:15.320 --> 10:21.400]  UK Canada the US it's all the same thing so the issue here is here they are three
[10:21.400 --> 10:25.960]  years ago three and a half years ago saying this is for terrorist and then
[10:25.960 --> 10:31.520]  now we learn today that's all over the news in the last few weeks that oh you
[10:31.520 --> 10:37.240]  didn't pay the city fee to have a swimming pool you didn't get
[10:37.240 --> 10:42.320]  environmental approval or zoning approval to build that shed on your farm
[10:42.320 --> 10:49.380]  or to re-roof that house so they're using it and of course you've seen the
[10:49.380 --> 10:53.360]  famous Pennsylvania ad that came out this year where it shows them
[10:53.360 --> 10:58.280]  surveilling somebody with a satellite named Tom saying we know where you live
[10:58.280 --> 11:05.360]  Tom you owe us $4,000 Tom we're coming to get you Tom so they go from trying to
[11:05.360 --> 11:11.000]  unveil this the name of fighting al-CIA to al-Qaeda to now admitting it's for we
[11:11.000 --> 11:14.640]  the people here it is
[11:15.840 --> 11:20.880]  first there were eyes on the street and now there are eyes in the skies the
[11:20.880 --> 11:24.520]  director of national intelligence has given the go-ahead for the nation's spy
[11:24.520 --> 11:29.760]  satellites to be used regularly by US civilian agencies and law enforcement
[11:29.760 --> 11:33.400]  this is a development all Americans should have great pride in because it
[11:33.400 --> 11:38.200]  expands and uses a national technical systems which we've built for tens of
[11:38.200 --> 11:42.160]  billions of dollars over many decades spy satellites have primarily been used
[11:42.160 --> 11:46.480]  overseas to monitor things like war zones and terror training camps they've
[11:46.480 --> 11:51.160]  also been used domestically but sparingly during events including Super Bowl
[11:51.160 --> 11:55.360]  games presidential inaugurals and hurricanes homeland security officials
[11:55.360 --> 11:58.760]  say the satellites will now be used to protect borders and critical
[11:58.760 --> 12:04.400]  infrastructure which includes sports and looking at potential vulnerabilities and
[12:04.400 --> 12:09.640]  and threats as well as consequences of attacks next in line law enforcement
[12:09.640 --> 12:13.360]  agencies which are expected to start using them next year well they can
[12:13.360 --> 12:16.920]  provide crucial high-resolution images there are limits to what these
[12:16.920 --> 12:22.000]  satellites can do they can't see faces and they can't listen at least that's
[12:22.000 --> 12:25.840]  what the government claims but privacy groups worry that because there's so
[12:25.840 --> 12:29.760]  much we don't know about their capabilities they could be misused and
[12:29.760 --> 12:34.760]  we wouldn't even know it the question always comes down to what are the
[12:34.760 --> 12:39.960]  standards are their checks and balances and is this a power that we would trust
[12:39.960 --> 12:45.720]  the executive branch to use without any outside scrutiny or oversight or
[12:45.720 --> 12:49.880]  controlling homeland security officials insist that they are subject to a great
[12:49.880 --> 12:54.360]  amount of oversight and review but in many ways this is just one more case of
[12:54.360 --> 12:58.560]  the government figuring it out as it goes in the war on terror Kelly arena
[12:58.560 --> 13:04.720]  CNN Washington they're not figuring anything out as they go they pre
[13:04.720 --> 13:09.360]  meditatively lied to you about taking your baby's blood at birth of your 38
[13:09.360 --> 13:13.640]  years old or younger you had your blood secretly taken whether you live in
[13:13.640 --> 13:17.600]  England the United States Australia New Zealand Canada it's a global program
[13:17.600 --> 13:22.160]  most European nations Western European nations they lied to you and said they
[13:22.160 --> 13:26.200]  weren't saving your naked body scan images we could read the homeland
[13:26.200 --> 13:30.920]  security purchase orders and it's stated they're designed to save all your images
[13:30.920 --> 13:36.200]  and attach it to your name and social security number and drivers license and
[13:36.200 --> 13:42.320]  passport they're databaseing your biometric body scan and training you to
[13:42.320 --> 13:46.800]  accept this form of tyranny the government isn't figuring this out as
[13:46.800 --> 13:51.480]  they go member bush getting up four years ago and saying we do not spy on
[13:51.480 --> 13:56.240]  Americans without warrants I promise you turns out he signed all the orders for
[13:56.240 --> 14:02.800]  unlimited spying without warrants they lie to you as a matter of course remember
[14:02.800 --> 14:06.840]  they promised that the trillions of dollars in the bailout would only be
[14:06.840 --> 14:12.600]  800 billion then it turned out to be tens of trillions they promised it would
[14:12.600 --> 14:18.040]  be immediately to unlock the mortgage situation none of the money went to that
[14:18.040 --> 14:22.120]  the next day October 4th they said we're spending none of it on that and
[14:22.120 --> 14:26.800]  we're not going to tell Congress where the money's going and for more than 60
[14:26.800 --> 14:31.840]  years Congress has requested to know where the US gold supply is no one's
[14:31.840 --> 14:35.400]  allowed to inspect it no one's allowed to look at it because under the Federal
[14:35.400 --> 14:40.240]  Reserve Act it's under the private banks control now Ron Paul is no doubt risking
[14:40.240 --> 14:47.480]  his life saying he wants an audit of Fort Knox and other gold deposits
[14:47.480 --> 14:54.720]  depositories you don't hear Glenn Beck calling for a audit of the gold do you
[14:54.720 --> 14:59.240]  you don't care hear him calling for an audit of the Fed if he started doing
[14:59.240 --> 15:03.200]  stuff like that he wouldn't be on Fox News very long and I'd be supporting him
[15:03.200 --> 15:07.080]  and I'm not here trying to attack Glenn Beck I'm just pointing out that he
[15:07.080 --> 15:15.440]  doesn't go one-tenth as far as he should with the amazing power that he has
[15:15.440 --> 15:20.120]  because they know that the American people have awakened they know that
[15:20.120 --> 15:25.760]  Ron Paul and many others had become focal points for a huge movement to
[15:25.760 --> 15:29.160]  seriously challenge the left-right paradigm and the Republican and
[15:29.160 --> 15:35.960]  Democratic parties and the system brought in Glenn Beck and others to co-op
[15:35.960 --> 15:40.080]  that at that key moment they've been very successful by the way the reason I
[15:40.080 --> 15:44.160]  raised that it's it's it's in my stack I'm gonna cover it after the bottom of
[15:44.160 --> 15:50.160]  the hour break Ron Paul has put out an editorial that was published in major
[15:50.160 --> 15:54.560]  newspapers across the country including the New York Times of all places they
[15:54.560 --> 15:59.880]  went with it because they think it'll drive a wedge between Republicans and
[15:59.880 --> 16:05.000]  Democrats and for the left-right paradigm it'll actually do the opposite
[16:05.000 --> 16:08.760]  and they're they're scared of Glenn Beck right now bringing the Republicans
[16:08.760 --> 16:13.160]  into the power structure they're they're back into control the power
[16:13.160 --> 16:18.800]  structure but the point is you read Ron Paul's editorial he explains that he's
[16:18.800 --> 16:22.680]  against Obama and he's against the Republican leadership because if you
[16:22.680 --> 16:28.080]  look at their voting records not their rhetoric look at what they do not what
[16:28.080 --> 16:33.320]  they say government grows when Republicans are in almost as fast as it
[16:33.320 --> 16:37.240]  does when Obama's gotten into office in fact previously government would grow
[16:37.240 --> 16:41.600]  even faster under Republicans than it would under Democrats if you look at
[16:41.600 --> 16:50.320]  the statistics but now under Obama all those rules have been broken I mean you
[16:50.320 --> 16:54.120]  would imagine that it would be Democrats with their tax and spin system that
[16:54.120 --> 16:57.920]  would actually create the biggest deficits and things but if you look at
[16:57.920 --> 17:02.200]  the averages normally Republicans tend to get even more big government through
[17:02.200 --> 17:06.160]  because conservatives go to sleep but now under Obama with the government
[17:06.160 --> 17:12.840]  takeover of health care with expanding these wars expanding the size of the
[17:12.840 --> 17:18.320]  federal government he has tripled the size of government in only a year and a
[17:18.320 --> 17:24.560]  half an office when George W. Bush only doubled it a little more than doubled
[17:24.560 --> 17:28.760]  you can go pull up the statistics on that but Obama has spent more money than
[17:28.760 --> 17:34.160]  all presidents before him combined that's George W. Bush back to George
[17:34.160 --> 17:42.280]  Washington it's really such big numbers it's hard to even get your mind around
[17:42.280 --> 17:49.160]  this but going back to the satellite issue spy satellites used to control
[17:49.160 --> 17:55.720]  American citizens Curt Nimo did a boil-down story on this today showing
[17:55.720 --> 18:04.520]  how all these mainstream publications are promoting how great it is that the
[18:04.520 --> 18:12.680]  environmental agencies and law enforcement agencies are now basically
[18:12.680 --> 18:18.240]  you know skipping all of the mid-moves and going right to the endgame where
[18:18.240 --> 18:22.520]  they're just coming right out and saying we're going to use this for
[18:22.520 --> 18:27.440]  everything we're going to use this and we're going to issue pupils government
[18:27.440 --> 18:32.480]  jerseys they've got to wear basically prisoner shirts that have RFID tracking
[18:32.480 --> 18:36.080]  them in real time and yes we're putting up microphones to track you on the
[18:36.080 --> 18:41.360]  street corners and yes we've got mobile x-ray vans that drive around x-raying
[18:41.360 --> 18:46.280]  your house from a distance I mean I knew 14 years ago I'd seen Pentagon
[18:46.280 --> 18:54.800]  purchase orders for domestic helicopters with x-ray high-powered x-ray systems
[18:54.800 --> 19:00.600]  mounted to them not just infrared but x-ray but but now it's in Forbes telling
[19:00.600 --> 19:04.840]  you how great it is and there's the health issues from this there's the
[19:04.840 --> 19:12.840]  privacy issues yesterday I was pretty nasty in the three hours very negative
[19:12.840 --> 19:20.720]  because it's just disgust me how bonafide and naked this tyranny is by any
[19:20.720 --> 19:28.280]  measurement by any yardstick by any historical perspective and it's racing
[19:28.280 --> 19:35.840]  in its growth and it's our tax money doing it as we go bankrupt and Mexico is
[19:35.840 --> 19:42.200]  descending into absolute hell every day it gets more insane and our government
[19:42.200 --> 19:46.520]  won't use the spy satellites to take care of that in fact our government's
[19:46.520 --> 19:51.440]  funding many of the massacres that are going on down there it's all coming up
[19:51.440 --> 19:56.280]  I'll get into the economy next and a bunch of global warming news what they've
[19:56.280 --> 20:01.760]  been caught red-handed more fraud their house of cards is coming down as many
[20:01.760 --> 20:05.280]  people know ever since president Nixon took us off the gold standard the US
[20:05.280 --> 20:08.760]  dollar has been evaluating what people don't know however is how this directly
[20:08.760 --> 20:12.400]  affects your personal finances is there a way to prevent your portfolios from
[20:12.400 --> 20:16.560]  losing value the answer to all of this is gold and silver they've both maintained
[20:16.560 --> 20:21.480]  their purchasing power for 6,000 years if you had had $100,000 in cash and
[20:21.480 --> 20:27.360]  $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them both until now your cash
[20:27.360 --> 20:32.160]  would actually have the buying power of only $4,800 but your gold and silver
[20:32.160 --> 20:36.200]  would have the buying power of $3,000,000 the answer to protecting your assets is

[24:09.520 --> 24:17.040]  I fell into a burning ring of fire I went down down down and the flames were high
[24:17.040 --> 24:22.000]  let's look at the economic news here's a Bloomberg headline out this morning
[24:22.000 --> 24:31.640]  gold rallying to 1,500 as Soros's bubble inflates and every time I've seen
[24:31.640 --> 24:36.040]  Bloomberg make a prediction like this it's come true and it isn't that gold
[24:36.040 --> 24:42.720]  is really going up it's that paper currencies worldwide are being devalued
[24:42.720 --> 24:49.480]  basically in concert investors are accumulating enough bullion to fill
[24:49.480 --> 24:56.280]  Switzerland's vaults twice over as gold's most accurate forecasters say the
[24:56.280 --> 25:01.480]  longest rally in at least nine decades has further to go no matter what the
[25:01.480 --> 25:08.400]  economy holds analysts raised their 2011 forecast more than for any other
[25:08.400 --> 25:15.960]  precious metal in the past two months predicting a tenth annual advance data
[25:15.960 --> 25:21.840]  compiled by Bloomberg shows the most widely held option of gold futures
[25:21.840 --> 25:31.720]  traded in New York for 1,500 an ounce by December did you hear that the most
[25:31.720 --> 25:38.080]  widely held option this is what the market's betting on on gold futures
[25:38.080 --> 25:48.520]  traded in New York is for 1,500 an ounce by December or an 18% more than the
[25:48.520 --> 25:59.760]  record 1,266 50 cents gold is up more than 13 dollars today and it's a market
[25:59.760 --> 26:06.760]  fundamental that as the Federal Reserve announces quantitative easing and a move
[26:06.760 --> 26:13.640]  towards global SDR is another layer of digital cashless currency amongst the
[26:13.640 --> 26:21.800]  banks based on carbon taxes based on carbon credits backed up by faltering
[26:21.800 --> 26:29.480]  currencies and as governments start monetizing their debt when the treasury
[26:29.480 --> 26:34.160]  issues bonds and governments and institutions and individuals don't buy
[26:34.160 --> 26:40.600]  all of them or in some cases even half of them the Federal Reserve comes in and
[26:40.600 --> 26:48.800]  creates more currency to buy its own debt and so to put this in layman's terms
[26:48.800 --> 26:52.120]  because I'm a layman myself I just I've been studying it for a long time but all
[26:52.120 --> 26:57.440]  the technical terms you know even a sometimes even escaped me though I try
[26:57.440 --> 27:04.200]  to understand it it's very simple it's kind of like saying Vegas is 2 to 1 for
[27:04.200 --> 27:10.840]  this football team at the Super Bowl or Vegas has got odds for this team to win
[27:10.840 --> 27:19.640]  and generally almost always the house wins that's why if you bet for the
[27:19.640 --> 27:25.560]  underdog and win you end up making a lot more money there's not a very big
[27:25.560 --> 27:31.400]  spread of profit if you bet for who Vegas is saying is going to win the
[27:31.400 --> 27:38.880]  Super Bowl so the majority of the money now on Wall Street in the futures
[27:38.880 --> 27:55.400]  market for December coming up in three months is on gold going up 18% and they
[27:55.400 --> 27:59.600]  talk about it only increasing in value after that in fact give me a document
[27:59.600 --> 28:04.600]  cam shot I'll I'll show people this article here today we can put it on
[28:04.600 --> 28:09.880]  screen I know you were earlier gold rallying to 1,500 as Soros bubble
[28:09.880 --> 28:14.240]  inflates and every time I talk about gold I get emails every time I talk about
[28:14.240 --> 28:19.240]  the stock market saying well I'm not in gold so I don't care or I'm not in the
[28:19.240 --> 28:23.800]  stock market so I don't care well almost every major corporation company in
[28:23.800 --> 28:30.920]  this country that produces jobs and pays taxes and pays for the infrastructure
[28:30.920 --> 28:37.720]  is in the stock market and that's how they're funding themselves and the big
[28:37.720 --> 28:43.560]  canary in the coal mine there's many unemployment numbers housing starts
[28:43.560 --> 28:49.360]  inflation numbers those are always important but the real canary in the
[28:49.360 --> 29:02.080]  coal mine is always gold gold and the fact that the majority or in their words
[29:02.080 --> 29:07.880]  the most widely held the most popular option on gold futures traded in New
[29:07.880 --> 29:20.680]  York is $1,500 an ounce by December so we're talking about three months from
[29:20.680 --> 29:26.280]  now it's the end of August September October November three months from now
[29:26.280 --> 29:31.880]  three months in one day technically will be into the month of December and
[29:31.880 --> 29:37.520]  Wall Street who it's all an insider game is saying it's gonna be 1500 an
[29:37.520 --> 29:44.560]  ounce so we'll continue to discuss the economy on the other side then I'm
[29:44.560 --> 29:53.280]  gonna get into the carbon taxing crowd we're on the March the Empire's on the
[29:53.280 --> 30:01.720]  run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network this is Alex Jones with five good

[33:10.120 --> 33:20.120]  resistance you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[33:20.120 --> 33:27.160]  it happens more and more I did hours of research Sunday night hours of research
[33:27.160 --> 33:32.400]  Monday morning about 30 minutes of scanning back over the news before I
[33:32.400 --> 33:40.040]  went live yesterday and then I got so upset and so overwhelmed by everything
[33:40.040 --> 33:47.040]  that yesterday overall I was pretty negative and defeatist and angry you
[33:47.040 --> 33:55.000]  know that feeling of almost like being dirty is like I don't mean dirty
[33:55.000 --> 34:03.160]  sexually or dirty like mud on your hands or mud on your feet I mean cloudy
[34:03.160 --> 34:09.320]  like you have ashes in your mouth just I guess you call it depression I don't
[34:09.320 --> 34:14.720]  really get depressed I get angry and disgusted and it's like a dark cloud is
[34:14.720 --> 34:19.520]  hanging over my head and I'm like why are public schools nationwide all over
[34:19.520 --> 34:29.160]  the country making children wear RFID tracker chips why is the government
[34:29.160 --> 34:33.840]  taking babies blood secretly at birth and lying about it why are they scanning
[34:33.840 --> 34:39.280]  our naked bodies at airports and saving it why does the CIA admit that they
[34:39.280 --> 34:46.960]  put out fake Bin Laden videos and there's no congressional investigation why
[34:46.960 --> 34:50.720]  are they putting naked body scanners in mobile trucks and federal and state
[34:50.720 --> 34:55.640]  courthouses why have foreign offshore banks stolen over 28 trillion dollars
[34:55.640 --> 35:03.600]  according to Bloomberg in the first year since the banker bailout oh yeah we
[35:03.600 --> 35:10.320]  haven't gotten new numbers in about eight months it was 28 trillion in January
[35:10.320 --> 35:18.440]  they don't even release the raw numbers anymore when I realize and and really
[35:18.440 --> 35:25.120]  consciously focus and I know I say this all the time because I'm dumbfounded I'm
[35:25.120 --> 35:31.120]  dumbfounded I can't believe that we're in this much tyranny and that it's
[35:31.120 --> 35:36.120]  accelerating this fast I see where it's going and every day I say on the
[35:36.120 --> 35:40.160]  broadcast because this is all I think about I look at my innocent children
[35:40.160 --> 35:46.760]  little bitty sweet children and how good they are and how full of creativity
[35:46.760 --> 35:55.960]  and love and curiosity they are and I think about how corrupt this world is
[35:55.960 --> 36:06.440]  and it just makes me so angry and so disgusted that I can't even describe it
[36:08.000 --> 36:12.880]  and then I become speechless you know that's what that's what happens then I
[36:12.880 --> 36:18.840]  have trouble even doing the radio broadcast because it's a painful process
[36:18.840 --> 36:24.960]  for me this isn't entertainment it's not fun sometimes I screw around and joke
[36:24.960 --> 36:30.800]  around and it's kind of good to get into that mindset sometimes so I'm not so
[36:30.800 --> 36:39.320]  stressed out and all work and no play you'll make anybody dull but at the same
[36:39.320 --> 36:44.160]  time when I do screw around or getting a good mood I feel guilty later because I
[36:44.160 --> 36:49.800]  realize how much trouble as a society we're really in I mean the globalist in
[36:49.800 --> 36:55.320]  their own records that we've linked to and reported on say they want to
[36:55.320 --> 37:05.560]  destroy our economy by design and they're doing it and they're shipping
[37:05.560 --> 37:11.080]  the narcotics in and murdering their competition that's what the Mexico
[37:11.080 --> 37:20.920]  Wars about and they're cold-blooded the globalist enjoy killing and if we don't
[37:20.920 --> 37:26.160]  wake up to that and realize that we have a global corporate tyranny dominating
[37:26.160 --> 37:29.800]  our nation and almost every other nation on earth and if we don't become more
[37:29.800 --> 37:37.200]  sophisticated and realize their systems of control 99% of us are going to be
[37:37.200 --> 37:41.720]  adversely affected by the changes happening in the world so many of you
[37:41.720 --> 37:47.440]  who are compartmentalized need to wake up and realize that you are under attack
[37:47.440 --> 37:51.480]  I mean here's an example and then I'm getting back into the economy but but
[37:51.480 --> 38:06.000]  here's an example just yesterday we had had articles written at info wars dot
[38:06.000 --> 38:18.480]  com repeatedly and when I talk about this I don't want to just come on air and
[38:18.480 --> 38:23.640]  talk about it and then have it just be some background chatter I mean I listen
[38:23.640 --> 38:29.440]  to rebroadcast of my show sometimes and sometimes it's very fluent it's very
[38:29.440 --> 38:35.200]  clear it's very eloquent it's filled with truth and charisma and other times
[38:35.200 --> 38:42.440]  I'm sitting there barking out kind of just chirping out statistics and numbers
[38:42.440 --> 38:50.120]  and incredible facts and truth but still I don't pause to illustrate just how
[38:50.120 --> 38:58.680]  massive the news and information is and I don't feel worthy to even be bringing
[38:58.680 --> 39:06.120]  you this information it's so incredible and I don't think the average bureaucrat
[39:06.120 --> 39:11.480]  or media minion who goes along with all of this fully understands just how
[39:11.480 --> 39:18.120]  murderous the globalist are and how dangerous this situation is
[39:18.120 --> 39:28.440]  tyranny is not fun and it ends in mass murder and death
[39:28.440 --> 39:36.040]  world war two conservatively killed about 64 million people on all sides and our
[39:36.040 --> 39:42.000]  government brags that they put pole pod into power who killed 30% of Cambodia's
[39:42.000 --> 39:49.080]  population conservatively Mao Zedong who the Chinese say killed 84 million 85
[39:49.080 --> 39:56.920]  million the US government says about 64 million so you better get this straight
[39:56.920 --> 40:02.120]  the globalist like to wipe out large groups of people to reorganize society
[40:02.120 --> 40:06.720]  to secure their ill-gotten gains and they're getting ready to pull similar
[40:06.720 --> 40:12.280]  things here in the United States this depression is only the beginning and that
[40:12.280 --> 40:18.480]  isn't what I think that's what I know that's not my opinion that's the
[40:18.480 --> 40:27.000]  historical fact do you get that do you understand that but I thought about those
[40:27.000 --> 40:31.640]  articles last week out of the hundreds of books I've read and Aaron Dykes has
[40:31.640 --> 40:35.240]  read out of the hundreds and hundreds of white papers we've read out of the
[40:35.240 --> 40:39.440]  hundreds of articles that Kurt Nemo Paul Watson Steve Watson Aaron Dykes and
[40:39.440 --> 40:44.960]  myself and and and other writers for info wars have written over the years I
[40:44.960 --> 40:52.280]  didn't even know that for more than 20 years the Rockefeller Foundation had
[40:52.280 --> 40:57.080]  released hundreds and hundreds of different documents bragging how they
[40:57.080 --> 41:01.600]  developed the tetanus vaccine with the female hormone added to sterilize
[41:01.600 --> 41:07.040]  women I knew about the UN program when they got caught doing it in the 90s but
[41:07.040 --> 41:10.880]  I didn't know that and then Rob do found a bunch of others on the Rockefeller
[41:10.880 --> 41:15.720]  Foundation site they're the ones putting this out they're proud of it with even
[41:15.720 --> 41:20.360]  more stuff they're putting in the vaccines I mean we have them red-handed
[41:20.360 --> 41:24.160]  and then I get disgusted with myself laying in bed last night at midnight
[41:24.160 --> 41:30.800]  thinking you've had those documents for a week you've posted a couple articles
[41:30.800 --> 41:38.120]  about it last night I was late to my grandmother's 85th birthday party we
[41:38.120 --> 41:43.400]  had one Sunday and Monday different family coming into town because I
[41:43.400 --> 41:48.920]  couldn't leave my office I was there reading these documents I mean what is
[41:48.920 --> 41:54.600]  the normal response what am I supposed to do I don't want to sell advertising I
[41:54.600 --> 42:00.520]  don't care about changing the oil in my car I don't care about dressing nice
[42:00.520 --> 42:04.960]  I don't care about being well known in the media I don't have all these petty
[42:04.960 --> 42:09.880]  rivalries and things I mean I we all do to a certain extent but those those
[42:09.880 --> 42:15.680]  areas in me my ego is dissipating I actually kind of need my ego we all do
[42:15.680 --> 42:27.000]  to propel ourselves forward and I'm losing it because the reality of my
[42:27.000 --> 42:34.520]  food my water the vaccines being poisoned and having all the proof the
[42:34.520 --> 42:39.360]  proof they're drugging the water and food the proof they're adding bio weapons
[42:39.360 --> 42:43.160]  to the vaccines the proof they're designing pharmacological crops and
[42:43.160 --> 42:50.640]  pharmacological chimera fish and pigs and other meat products designed to
[42:50.640 --> 42:55.040]  brain damage us give us cancer and sterilizes I mean it doesn't get any
[42:55.040 --> 43:01.240]  more heavy than that have you seen the end of the famous 1950s body snatchers
[43:01.240 --> 43:07.680]  guys pull up the end the end of a body snatchers the end of the original body
[43:07.680 --> 43:13.920]  snatchers I guarantee it's on YouTube it's not the one in the 70s you know
[43:13.920 --> 43:17.560]  where she's in the park in DC and says is that you and then her friends been
[43:17.560 --> 43:23.040]  turned into one and he he hisses at her not that one it's it's the one where the
[43:23.040 --> 43:26.840]  doctor sees the town get taken over so he's running through the hills his wife
[43:26.840 --> 43:31.120]  gets turned into one she falls asleep now she's after him he's running through
[43:31.120 --> 43:35.920]  the hills he runs out on the highway from Bakersfield and he this truck almost
[43:35.920 --> 43:39.360]  runs over him and he climbs up in the back of the truck and it's the it's the
[43:39.360 --> 43:44.520]  pod people it's the pods and they're going into LA and he's screaming you're
[43:44.520 --> 43:51.200]  in danger they're everywhere runs for your lives but this hidden pod people
[43:51.200 --> 43:57.200]  carried on the solar winds by meteorites landing and taking over this is a group
[43:57.200 --> 44:02.120]  of scientific elites who've cold-bloodily decided to scientifically conquer
[44:02.120 --> 44:06.360]  society they say oh dictators didn't have it right we'll do it by stealth and
[44:06.360 --> 44:09.760]  with science we'll drug the food and water dumb them down put stuff in the
[44:09.760 --> 44:15.240]  vaccines this is in the 20s now I've got all their documents from the 50s 60s
[44:15.240 --> 44:20.960]  and 70s where they were planning it now they're doing it and it literally I
[44:20.960 --> 44:27.080]  should be running around in traffic I'm not saying do that I'm saying that's
[44:27.080 --> 44:32.120]  what that's the normal response screaming we're in danger they're taking over
[44:32.120 --> 44:41.760]  warn everyone I mean people should be on hunger strikes banner hangs state houses
[44:41.760 --> 44:45.320]  should have millions of people around them in throngs everyone should be
[44:45.320 --> 44:49.480]  freaking out but we've only discovered they're putting poisons in the water and
[44:49.480 --> 44:54.600]  food after they hit us the public's already been hit by this stuff they're
[44:54.600 --> 45:02.000]  already being inculcated into the brain damage they're already being inculcated
[45:02.000 --> 45:07.080]  into the mind control they're already brain damage that's why they can't get
[45:07.080 --> 45:13.240]  upset it's why they're listening to me now they can go find the documents they've
[45:13.240 --> 45:16.520]  even heard about it on mainstream news like oh we want to put lithium in your
[45:16.520 --> 45:27.160]  water and maybe we should sterilize people because we're already drugged now
[45:27.160 --> 45:33.080]  let me get back into the economy here it's the same thing on the economy we
[45:33.080 --> 45:39.320]  know they're starting to monetize the debt that is print money we know they've
[45:39.320 --> 45:43.600]  made this decision they're openly announcing the global government the
[45:43.600 --> 45:46.840]  new global digital currency the bandcore that everything else is going to be
[45:46.840 --> 45:52.640]  based on this is official IMF and I've got to sit here and watch Glenn Beck and
[45:52.640 --> 45:59.240]  Rush Limbaugh make fun of me look it's not funny when it's in the mainstream
[45:59.240 --> 46:03.240]  news and the drudge reports even linking to it and you guys are still running
[46:03.240 --> 46:07.240]  around denying it because you spent years saying it didn't exist we don't have
[46:07.240 --> 46:14.280]  time to screw around anymore I want Glenn Beck to talk about what's in the
[46:14.280 --> 46:18.520]  vaccines I want him to talk about the naked body scanners I want him to tell
[46:18.520 --> 46:23.880]  his audience to do more than just vote for Republicans look I just want my
[46:23.880 --> 46:30.200]  country and humanity back I mean look at this Bloomberg headline gold rallying
[46:30.200 --> 46:37.520]  to 1,500 is Soros bubble inflates and it goes on to say that the the most
[46:37.520 --> 46:42.600]  widely held options on gold futures traded in New York are one thousand five
[46:42.600 --> 46:48.680]  hundred dollars an ounce or eighteen percent higher by December three months
[46:48.680 --> 46:52.760]  from now gold's up over thirteen dollars today and they go on to say either a
[46:52.760 --> 46:57.120]  swift economic recovery or a further dismal economic performance should bring
[46:57.120 --> 47:02.320]  new buyers into the market said Eugene Weinberg an analyst with Commons Bank
[47:02.320 --> 47:06.760]  AG Frankfurt who was the most accurate forecaster in the first quarter and
[47:06.760 --> 47:15.000]  expects the metal to rise as high as one thousand four hundred next year he says
[47:15.000 --> 47:18.520]  a stronger economy would create more of a jewelry demand if the economy stays
[47:18.520 --> 47:21.720]  weaker gets worse than investors will be looking for a safe haven and they go
[47:21.720 --> 47:26.480]  through either way you slice it but I'm gonna shut up and bring Ted Anderson up
[47:26.480 --> 47:30.400]  then I'm gonna get into Ron Paul questions whether there's gold at Fort Knox
[47:30.400 --> 47:35.360]  and the New York Fed this is a big deal been covering it since last week it's
[47:35.360 --> 47:38.920]  now getting mainstream news attention since Kitko interviewing we're gonna
[47:38.920 --> 47:42.400]  get him back on soon to give us the inside scoop but we know all the gold
[47:42.400 --> 47:46.600]  was stolen and sold into Europe we've got the pieces of intel on that but
[47:46.600 --> 47:51.280]  imagine Congress isn't allowed to find out where the gold's at we just trust the
[47:51.280 --> 47:57.040]  bankers so Ron Paul needs to stay out of airplanes I mean he is really has a
[47:57.040 --> 48:02.440]  lot of courage he came out three months ago and said the CIA has had a coup
[48:02.440 --> 48:08.760]  d'etat in America and deals the drugs I mean you want courage it's Ron Paul but
[48:08.760 --> 48:13.880]  I digress Ted I haven't even asked you today when I called you to come on you
[48:13.880 --> 48:18.040]  bought a bunch of gold when it was sixty seventy dollars lower did you run out of
[48:18.040 --> 48:23.320]  that gold when you bought it when gold was lower and what's today special I
[48:23.320 --> 48:28.800]  know I still have some of those items Alex we have the Frank at 270 they're
[48:28.800 --> 48:33.040]  trading closer to 275 right now we have the British sovereign at 340 they're
[48:33.040 --> 48:38.640]  closer to 345 walking Liberty halves at 975 those ones are trading well into the
[48:38.640 --> 48:43.680]  $10 a piece we do have bags of junk sober we have you know the US single we
[48:43.680 --> 48:48.240]  even have some buffaloes but you're talking about yeah the jewelry the jewelry
[48:48.240 --> 48:54.000]  for India alone is going to go up from 400 trunk tons last year 480 this year
[48:54.000 --> 48:58.400]  they're expecting to see it at about 625 I mean the demand for gold is going up
[48:58.400 --> 49:04.320]  like you said Soros you know just last January Soros Soros was a seller in
[49:04.320 --> 49:09.840]  gold calling gold one of the the asset bubbles of all time and now he's a buyer
[49:09.840 --> 49:15.280]  he's talking about $1,500 gold there's so much going on in the marketplace
[49:15.280 --> 49:19.840]  right now you're talking about the government knowing that we're running
[49:19.840 --> 49:24.040]  into a crisis not only do they know that we're running into a crisis they
[49:24.040 --> 49:30.040]  published a document on July 27th that says that they're expecting a crisis to
[49:30.040 --> 49:39.280]  the magnitude of what occurred in Argentina in Brazil just recently in Greece they're
[49:39.280 --> 49:46.280]  pinning us to that too hey Ted Ted you're a microphone's cutting out there is it
[49:46.280 --> 49:50.200]  well it's probably my voice it's actually my voice was the microphone okay
[49:50.200 --> 49:55.520]  but recap what you were saying well I'm just saying that the government knows
[49:55.520 --> 50:00.160]  that we have problems they just they're they're aware of it they published a
[50:00.160 --> 50:05.440]  document on July 27th that point set out it's called the federal debt and risk of
[50:05.440 --> 50:10.920]  financial crises and people need to get this document they can get it for free
[50:10.920 --> 50:14.320]  we will mail it to you or you could actually take a look at it on the
[50:14.320 --> 50:19.080]  internet I don't care look the point is the government engineered the crisis of
[50:19.080 --> 50:23.640]  course they know what's going on we have the IMF World Bank documents so people
[50:23.640 --> 50:27.440]  need to call and get the free reported they want but I wouldn't screw around on
[50:27.440 --> 50:33.200]  that I get Frank's I'd get sovereigns I get buffalos you've got excellent deals
[50:33.200 --> 50:39.720]  on all of them amazing deals on silver tell them it's the radio special 800 686

[53:56.480 --> 54:12.400]  six nine again eight hundred nine zero two six nine six nine
[54:12.400 --> 54:18.880]  okay ladies and gentlemen so you see all this media hype demonizing gold I've
[54:18.880 --> 54:22.240]  been watching it for eight nine years as it went from two hundred and sixty
[54:22.240 --> 54:28.040]  bucks an ounce to one thousand two hundred and sixty something and now the
[54:28.040 --> 54:34.280]  most widely held future option for the month of December is fifteen hundred
[54:34.280 --> 54:41.440]  dollars an ounce so that's how the insiders are betting on gold going to
[54:41.440 --> 54:47.840]  fifteen hundred dollars an ounce but meanwhile I hear Kramer telling people
[54:47.840 --> 54:52.520]  invest in stocks that might give you two three four percent increase a year if
[54:52.520 --> 54:56.640]  you're lucky forget investing in gold where you can quadruple your money
[54:56.640 --> 55:00.840]  Ted yeah you know but there's a lot of motivation there because he handles
[55:00.840 --> 55:05.080]  stocks he's sitting there by Wall Street he's he's so much caught into that
[55:05.080 --> 55:10.160]  insider side of things that you know he you know is his benefits from selling
[55:10.160 --> 55:14.360]  stocks but I can tell you gold hit twelve hundred and fifty dollars an ounce
[55:14.360 --> 55:18.840]  Alex that puts us ten dollars away from the market peak from the last one I
[55:18.840 --> 55:24.240]  expect that gold will be trading much higher than the last market peak before
[55:24.240 --> 55:29.240]  we even hit October and we're only in August right now August 31st and being
[55:29.240 --> 55:34.360]  ten dollars behind the market peak that's pretty darn strong I again I would
[55:34.360 --> 55:38.840]  I would bet that George Soros is actually going to be right this time you
[55:38.840 --> 55:43.000]  know I mean he's a billionaire for a reason he's got the inside information I
[55:43.000 --> 55:47.280]  don't know why he was so influenced in the beginning of this year to tell
[55:47.280 --> 55:50.720]  people to get out of gold and that it was overinflated but he's reversed his
[55:50.720 --> 55:55.840]  his position you know 180 degrees and and he's saying buy and he's buying it
[55:55.840 --> 55:59.640]  himself and he's expecting gold hit fifteen hundred dollars an ounce I'm
[55:59.640 --> 56:03.800]  so suspecting that he'll be right I mean the lowest prediction in that article
[56:03.800 --> 56:08.320]  that drudge is pointing toward over at Bloomberg is thirteen hundred and fifty
[56:08.320 --> 56:11.480]  dollars an ounce and that's a hundred dollars higher from where we are I mean
[56:11.480 --> 56:16.600]  why wouldn't people buy gold coins that you have massively discounted that you
[56:16.600 --> 56:21.680]  bought back when gold was sixty seventy dollars lower a month ago why wouldn't
[56:21.680 --> 56:27.320]  they then get all those savings pass forward and then have all of this upside
[56:27.320 --> 56:30.840]  if they were getting it for an investment I get gold and silver as an
[56:30.840 --> 56:36.120]  emergency backup because I know the history of Germany and Zimbabwe and
[56:36.120 --> 56:41.400]  Europe and this country with devaluations of currency and I know that
[56:41.400 --> 56:45.600]  it's a great hedge against economic uncertainty and that's why Bloomberg says
[56:45.600 --> 56:49.920]  most people are getting into it and then I've got all this other news
[56:49.920 --> 56:55.960]  Ron Paul questions whether there's gold at Fort Knox New York and the Fed that's
[56:55.960 --> 57:00.200]  out of the Hill newspaper he first talked to Kitco last Wednesday we covered
[57:00.200 --> 57:04.960]  it then but here's Ron Paul coming right out and talking about the emperors new
[57:04.960 --> 57:09.600]  clothes and saying where is all the gold because the Federal Reserve fights
[57:09.600 --> 57:15.160]  kicking and screaming to never allow anybody to see that gold Ted well you
[57:15.160 --> 57:18.480]  know it just only makes sense that we audited it it's just one of those other
[57:18.480 --> 57:22.240]  things that the Federal Reserve wants to have secrecy they want to be able to
[57:22.240 --> 57:26.120]  move and move in a direction whichever they choose and they never want to be
[57:26.120 --> 57:30.000]  exposed and of course we the citizens of the United States should know how much
[57:30.000 --> 57:34.920]  gold is there they confiscated it from us in 1933 that's why it's that's right
[57:34.920 --> 57:40.560]  place for any Americans that think that government isn't tyrannical Roosevelt
[57:40.560 --> 57:45.000]  said give me all your gold I'm gonna give you paperback and a year later
[57:45.000 --> 57:48.680]  basically doubled the price of an announce and it turned out that the
[57:48.680 --> 57:53.320]  Firestone family and others had set up secret purchasing arms in Europe just
[57:53.320 --> 57:57.640]  trying to buy their own gold back and they got prosecuted that's how these
[57:57.640 --> 58:03.000]  bankers scam people so they hoarded our gold what was left they've already sold
[58:03.000 --> 58:08.320]  to themselves at discounted prices we need to be able to look at our gold and
[58:08.320 --> 58:12.960]  then arrest the Federal Reserve bank people I mean it's it's so simple Ted
[58:12.960 --> 58:16.920]  yeah it's so upside down though it's crazy call for the offer man I tell you
[58:16.920 --> 58:24.720]  now's the time to be doing it and the numbers 800 686 2237 again 1-800

[01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:47.520]  topics with Joel and take calls interspersed throughout the extended
[01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:51.200]  interview with him coming up also we're gonna be talking about control of food
[01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:56.120]  supply to be handed over to Department of Homeland Security and this is
[01:00:56.120 --> 01:01:02.320]  directly out of s5-10 deceptively titled the food safety and modernization act
[01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:07.160]  I'm gonna be talking more about that but getting back into financial news this
[01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:12.320]  is Bloomberg talking to top analysts they say the most accurate analyst predicts
[01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:15.680]  that it's gonna be one thousand four hundred dollars announced by the end of
[01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:21.480]  this year but the most widely held future option on gold is 1500 by
[01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:27.360]  December or an 18 percent increase and they go on to admit this is because the
[01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:30.440]  federal government has announced that they're gonna allow the private
[01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:34.920]  Federal Reserve to start monetizing the debt that's what happened in Weimar
[01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:39.560]  Republic Germany it's what happened in Zimbabwe it's what's happening all
[01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:48.520]  over the planet in fact in my wallet I've actually got a Zimbabwe and note
[01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:54.160]  that I'm a British media guy was here doing an interview for a magazine with
[01:01:54.160 --> 01:02:02.000]  me it's in here somewhere here it is and he was here and he gave me this in
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:07.840]  fact I'll show folks a document cam shot of this this is the Reserve Bank of
[01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:21.320]  Zimbabwe and that is a 50 million or no 50 trillion excuse me 50 trillion
[01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:27.800]  dollar note and currently this is what you need to go out and basically buy a
[01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:33.280]  small meal so if you want to go into one of their restaurants and have a bowl
[01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:41.840]  of rice and maybe some beef stew and a glass of Pepsi you need is that 50
[01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:49.640]  trillion or 500 trillion 50 trillion you need a 50 trillion dollar note these
[01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:53.200]  British reporters are actually over there doing a report on it and they said
[01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:58.480]  you could you could buy a small meal with this now this is how inflation works
[01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:02.160]  and they've done it in Argentina this is what these bankers do they inflate the
[01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:06.080]  money to buy real assets while they're in control then they leave you holding
[01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:10.960]  the bag and tell you with tax money you've got to pay all this off just like
[01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:14.800]  Obama has spent more than all presidents before him combined as bad as
[01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:19.240]  George W. Bush was as you go towards the end of this it accelerates and I've
[01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:23.640]  got other financial news again Ron Paul saying where's the missing gold India's
[01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:28.760]  growth rate is 8.8 as our growth rate stalls at 1.6 homeless up 50% in New

[01:09:46.660 --> 01:09:50.660]  That from the original Body Snatchers back in the 1950s.
[01:09:50.660 --> 01:09:56.660]  And no, we're not saying aliens are real or pod people are coming to get us.
[01:09:56.660 --> 01:10:02.660]  But that's the feeling I have a lot when I'm reading a Rockefeller Foundation document
[01:10:02.660 --> 01:10:06.660]  about how they did develop vaccines,
[01:10:06.660 --> 01:10:12.660]  where it's a tetanus pathogen with a female hormone added to it
[01:10:12.660 --> 01:10:16.660]  to sterilize the woman from 1968.
[01:10:16.660 --> 01:10:22.660]  And we link to those at infowars.com on the Rockefeller Foundation website.
[01:10:22.660 --> 01:10:24.660]  They're proud of this.
[01:10:24.660 --> 01:10:26.660]  And then I've got mainstream news articles from the 90s,
[01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:32.660]  where the UN was caught sterilizing women with these vaccines.
[01:10:32.660 --> 01:10:34.660]  And then I get John P. Holdren's book,
[01:10:34.660 --> 01:10:38.660]  about what science are about drugging the water supply.
[01:10:38.660 --> 01:10:40.660]  And then we discover they're already testing it.
[01:10:40.660 --> 01:10:44.660]  And you tell people this and it sounds crazy.
[01:10:44.660 --> 01:10:48.660]  Just like 15 years ago, when I got secret documents from a nurse,
[01:10:48.660 --> 01:10:54.660]  that all children at birth had their blood taken for a secret eugenics database.
[01:10:54.660 --> 01:10:57.660]  That's now declassified last two years.
[01:10:57.660 --> 01:11:03.660]  There is a giant secret overarching program run by what the establishment calls
[01:11:03.660 --> 01:11:07.660]  the scientific dictatorship.
[01:11:07.660 --> 01:11:10.660]  The final revolution to end the family,
[01:11:10.660 --> 01:11:15.660]  to remake man in an image of their choosing.
[01:11:15.660 --> 01:11:20.660]  Now, I've got a lot of subjects I want to discuss in the next hour
[01:11:20.660 --> 01:11:22.660]  and 50 minutes with Joel Skelson.
[01:11:22.660 --> 01:11:25.660]  We also have loaded phone lines, and he can talk on any issue.
[01:11:25.660 --> 01:11:27.660]  It's been many years since I had him on.
[01:11:27.660 --> 01:11:29.660]  I had him on last week.
[01:11:29.660 --> 01:11:32.660]  It had been many years since he'd been on when I had him on last week.
[01:11:32.660 --> 01:11:36.660]  And I wanted to have him on for an extended interview
[01:11:36.660 --> 01:11:40.660]  to cover a bunch of issues quickly, to get his take, his view,
[01:11:40.660 --> 01:11:43.660]  because it's thought-provoking and insightful on a host of issues,
[01:11:43.660 --> 01:11:51.660]  and to also take your comments or questions at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:11:51.660 --> 01:11:53.660]  And so he was on with us a few weeks ago.
[01:11:53.660 --> 01:11:56.660]  He is back with us today.
[01:11:56.660 --> 01:12:00.660]  And of course, he is the editor of World Affairs Brief.
[01:12:00.660 --> 01:12:04.660]  He, of course, is the nephew of Cleon Skelson,
[01:12:04.660 --> 01:12:06.660]  who wrote two best-selling books,
[01:12:06.660 --> 01:12:09.660]  exposing the whole globalist system, the whole New World Order system,
[01:12:09.660 --> 01:12:12.660]  that was really a seminal work that led to Nundair Call of Conspiracy
[01:12:12.660 --> 01:12:14.660]  and many others.
[01:12:14.660 --> 01:12:17.660]  He's, of course, served as a fighter pilot for the U.S. Marine Corps
[01:12:17.660 --> 01:12:22.660]  during Vietnam, and, of course, has also been a writer and researcher
[01:12:22.660 --> 01:12:25.660]  speaking widely around the United States and the world,
[01:12:25.660 --> 01:12:28.660]  very accurately exposing the globalist agenda.
[01:12:28.660 --> 01:12:33.660]  World Affairs Brief.com is his website, and he joins us now.
[01:12:33.660 --> 01:12:35.660]  Joel, good to have you here with us.
[01:12:35.660 --> 01:12:37.660]  Thank you, Alex. It's good to be with you.
[01:12:37.660 --> 01:12:41.660]  I must say I was surprised at the overwhelming response.
[01:12:41.660 --> 01:12:44.660]  I was getting a World Affairs Brief after our interview.
[01:12:44.660 --> 01:12:49.660]  It just seems like people are hungry to make sense of some of the contradictions
[01:12:49.660 --> 01:12:50.660]  that are out there.
[01:12:50.660 --> 01:12:52.660]  There's just an awful lot of disinformation,
[01:12:52.660 --> 01:12:56.660]  a lot of problem-internation floating on the web,
[01:12:56.660 --> 01:13:01.660]  and people listen, I think, to your show to get some understanding about that.
[01:13:01.660 --> 01:13:05.660]  Well, we have a wide spectrum of guests and ideas here,
[01:13:05.660 --> 01:13:08.660]  but at the end of the day, we've been pretty accurate about forecasting
[01:13:08.660 --> 01:13:12.660]  where society's going, and I concur with much of your analysis
[01:13:12.660 --> 01:13:14.660]  and breakdown of society.
[01:13:14.660 --> 01:13:16.660]  I want to move through a lot of news with you today,
[01:13:16.660 --> 01:13:20.660]  but last time you were on, we ran out of time
[01:13:20.660 --> 01:13:24.660]  getting into one section of the World Affairs Brief you did a month or two ago,
[01:13:24.660 --> 01:13:27.660]  dealing with the dark side of law enforcement in the military
[01:13:27.660 --> 01:13:31.660]  and how Iraq and Afghanistan were being used as laboratories
[01:13:31.660 --> 01:13:36.660]  to find people that will do bad things.
[01:13:36.660 --> 01:13:38.660]  The majority of our military and police are great people.
[01:13:38.660 --> 01:13:41.660]  I meet them all the time. I run into them.
[01:13:41.660 --> 01:13:45.660]  Literally every time a police car drives by when I'm walking my dog
[01:13:45.660 --> 01:13:48.660]  or I'm in a coffee shop or walk out of a restaurant
[01:13:48.660 --> 01:13:52.660]  and police come over and they're oath keepers, they're patriots.
[01:13:52.660 --> 01:13:56.660]  They laugh at us 10 years ago, but they heard us talk about this stuff,
[01:13:56.660 --> 01:13:59.660]  and now 10 years later, they've seen it all come true,
[01:13:59.660 --> 01:14:03.660]  so they're really paying attention now, so I know they're good men and women.
[01:14:03.660 --> 01:14:08.660]  But for every 10 good officers, they find that sociopath,
[01:14:08.660 --> 01:14:13.660]  that psychopath, that control freak who's attracted to power,
[01:14:13.660 --> 01:14:17.660]  and they recruit them, and I've been aware of this from my own research
[01:14:17.660 --> 01:14:20.660]  and also studying other authoritarian systems like the Nazis and others
[01:14:20.660 --> 01:14:24.660]  and the Communists, but you say you've got a lot of sources
[01:14:24.660 --> 01:14:26.660]  and have done some of your own research on it,
[01:14:26.660 --> 01:14:29.660]  so I'd like you to spend the balance of this segment on that.
[01:14:29.660 --> 01:14:32.660]  Then we'll spend a segment on whatever issue you think is most important,
[01:14:32.660 --> 01:14:35.660]  and then I've got a bunch of questions I want to throw at you
[01:14:35.660 --> 01:14:39.660]  on a laundry list of issues, and then phone calls, Joel.
[01:14:39.660 --> 01:14:44.660]  Great. You're referring to my article commenting on Top Secret America,
[01:14:44.660 --> 01:14:48.660]  the hidden world growing beyond control of Washington Post,
[01:14:48.660 --> 01:14:53.660]  but as I point out, whenever a shield for the government
[01:14:53.660 --> 01:14:58.660]  puts out a supposed expose about government, it's a cover, it's a diversion,
[01:14:58.660 --> 01:15:02.660]  because what they will reveal will be enticing, will be interesting,
[01:15:02.660 --> 01:15:06.660]  and they do drop a few secrets here and there, nothing harmful to the system.
[01:15:06.660 --> 01:15:11.660]  So what was totally missing from this whole eight-part series on Top Secret America
[01:15:11.660 --> 01:15:15.660]  was anything of substance about what is being done in secret,
[01:15:15.660 --> 01:15:20.660]  the difference between what I call the white side of government and the black side.
[01:15:20.660 --> 01:15:24.660]  And increasingly, what's been happening in the United States
[01:15:24.660 --> 01:15:28.660]  is the black side has been growing by leaps and bounds
[01:15:28.660 --> 01:15:31.660]  just to recap for your listeners.
[01:15:31.660 --> 01:15:36.660]  In every law enforcement agency of the United States federal government,
[01:15:36.660 --> 01:15:41.660]  whether it is the DEA, the CIA, the FBI, the INS, ICE,
[01:15:41.660 --> 01:15:43.660]  the Immigration and Custom Enforcement,
[01:15:43.660 --> 01:15:46.660]  there are good guys, white side people,
[01:15:46.660 --> 01:15:49.660]  the type of people that you are mentioning and talking about,
[01:15:49.660 --> 01:15:51.660]  the type of people we expect to be in there,
[01:15:51.660 --> 01:15:54.660]  and they still recruit for that side, specifically.
[01:15:54.660 --> 01:15:57.660]  They like to recruit a lot of Mormons, for example,
[01:15:57.660 --> 01:15:59.660]  who have been returned missionaries, clean cut.
[01:15:59.660 --> 01:16:02.660]  They make good, naive government supporters,
[01:16:02.660 --> 01:16:04.660]  they come into the CIA and the FBI,
[01:16:04.660 --> 01:16:07.660]  and they make good believers because they're taught religiously
[01:16:07.660 --> 01:16:10.660]  to support their government and to support law and order.
[01:16:10.660 --> 01:16:14.660]  But you know, that could be a fault when you refuse to see
[01:16:14.660 --> 01:16:17.660]  what you see and what happens in government.
[01:16:17.660 --> 01:16:22.660]  And so there's an increasingly active dark side of every organization.
[01:16:22.660 --> 01:16:26.660]  I'm convinced now, Alex, that the dark side of government,
[01:16:26.660 --> 01:16:30.660]  because of the increase in the use of private military contractors
[01:16:30.660 --> 01:16:35.660]  to breed and cull out and to recruit unprincipled people,
[01:16:35.660 --> 01:16:38.660]  has grown to be larger than the white side
[01:16:38.660 --> 01:16:41.660]  on every one of these organizations now.
[01:16:41.660 --> 01:16:43.660]  And that's a scary thought.
[01:16:43.660 --> 01:16:45.660]  They're bigger than the white side now.
[01:16:45.660 --> 01:16:50.660]  And it's becoming increasingly difficult to hide the activities of dark side.
[01:16:50.660 --> 01:16:54.660]  Now, that's one of the reasons why I think Top Secret America was written,
[01:16:54.660 --> 01:16:57.660]  was to hide behind the excuse of overgrowth,
[01:16:57.660 --> 01:17:01.660]  over complexity, over 2,000 private military contractors
[01:17:01.660 --> 01:17:05.660]  dealing with hundreds of federal agencies,
[01:17:05.660 --> 01:17:08.660]  dealing with no names that we don't understand,
[01:17:08.660 --> 01:17:12.660]  that are hidden behind multiple layers in the government.
[01:17:12.660 --> 01:17:15.660]  But I'm convinced this whole thing is a charade
[01:17:15.660 --> 01:17:19.660]  to make sure that people have an excuse to be able to write this office.
[01:17:19.660 --> 01:17:22.660]  Well, we can't understand it. It's just too complex now.
[01:17:22.660 --> 01:17:26.660]  And that was the purpose of the Washington Post article.
[01:17:26.660 --> 01:17:31.660]  Well, they say 854,000 spies.
[01:17:31.660 --> 01:17:36.660]  But if you look at InfraGuard, the clergy response teams,
[01:17:36.660 --> 01:17:40.660]  the Protestants, the Catholics, the Mormons, the rabbis,
[01:17:40.660 --> 01:17:44.660]  they have all, as part of a nine-year-old program now,
[01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:48.660]  been infiltrated and taught when the martial law comes,
[01:17:48.660 --> 01:17:50.660]  tell them go to the FEMA camps.
[01:17:50.660 --> 01:17:52.660]  I mean, this is in the documents that we got
[01:17:52.660 --> 01:17:54.660]  three years before it was mainstream news.
[01:17:54.660 --> 01:17:57.660]  Then they had mainstream newscasts with preachers going,
[01:17:57.660 --> 01:18:01.660]  during martial law, the enemy of the government is the people.
[01:18:01.660 --> 01:18:03.660]  Not the people are the government,
[01:18:03.660 --> 01:18:06.660]  and the government serves them in the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:18:06.660 --> 01:18:09.660]  And so there is this giant complex of control.
[01:18:09.660 --> 01:18:12.660]  And even though a lot of it's been secret,
[01:18:12.660 --> 01:18:14.660]  we've gotten a lot of the different pieces of it
[01:18:14.660 --> 01:18:17.660]  from good people inside government.
[01:18:17.660 --> 01:18:19.660]  And then later, the establishment comes out
[01:18:19.660 --> 01:18:21.660]  and kind of hides it in plain view
[01:18:21.660 --> 01:18:23.660]  and puts their own spin on it.
[01:18:23.660 --> 01:18:25.660]  But this isn't the American way.
[01:18:25.660 --> 01:18:27.660]  This is more like the East Germans to have,
[01:18:27.660 --> 01:18:29.660]  you know, secretly controlling the churches
[01:18:29.660 --> 01:18:35.660]  and recruiting executives to serve as spies.
[01:18:35.660 --> 01:18:38.660]  And then you look at the architecture, Joel,
[01:18:38.660 --> 01:18:41.660]  the whole thing is pointed at gun owners, conservatives,
[01:18:41.660 --> 01:18:44.660]  libertarians, returning veterans,
[01:18:44.660 --> 01:18:47.660]  as the Mayak and Homeland Security reports show.
[01:18:47.660 --> 01:18:51.660]  None of it is pointed, except for PR purposes on the surface,
[01:18:51.660 --> 01:18:55.660]  at Muslims, at Al-Ciatis.
[01:18:55.660 --> 01:18:57.660]  Absolutely correct.
[01:18:57.660 --> 01:18:59.660]  One of the things we have to understand, however,
[01:18:59.660 --> 01:19:04.660]  is that this program of integrating naive church people
[01:19:04.660 --> 01:19:07.660]  into the system is informal at best.
[01:19:07.660 --> 01:19:11.660]  It is not knit together in a closed, completely numbered,
[01:19:11.660 --> 01:19:15.660]  call one, two, three, and this is guaranteed to happen.
[01:19:15.660 --> 01:19:17.660]  They're heading that way in the future.
[01:19:17.660 --> 01:19:20.660]  But we're actually quite a long way off from that.
[01:19:20.660 --> 01:19:22.660]  We're still in the building process of seeing
[01:19:22.660 --> 01:19:25.660]  who can be snookered into supporting these
[01:19:25.660 --> 01:19:27.660]  without having any warning signals go up.
[01:19:27.660 --> 01:19:29.660]  And it isn't uniform.
[01:19:29.660 --> 01:19:31.660]  You can't make the case, for example,
[01:19:31.660 --> 01:19:34.660]  that, you know, all the fundamentalist Christian leaders
[01:19:34.660 --> 01:19:36.660]  or Protestant leaders are into this.
[01:19:36.660 --> 01:19:37.660]  It's only a small percentage.
[01:19:37.660 --> 01:19:38.660]  No, exactly.
[01:19:38.660 --> 01:19:41.660]  It's a beta test to then see who will take the bait,
[01:19:41.660 --> 01:19:43.660]  who will go along with it,
[01:19:43.660 --> 01:19:46.660]  and to find out who sees it and who resist it.
[01:19:46.660 --> 01:19:47.660]  Exactly.
[01:19:47.660 --> 01:19:48.660]  Joel, stay there.
[01:19:48.660 --> 01:19:50.660]  Stop that and finish your comments.
[01:19:50.660 --> 01:19:51.660]  It's very astute.
[01:19:51.660 --> 01:19:53.660]  And we want to get more of your views on this
[01:19:53.660 --> 01:19:55.660]  than a host of other issues.
[01:19:55.660 --> 01:20:24.660]  With Joel Scalson, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:20:25.660 --> 01:20:27.660]  Thank you very much.
[01:20:56.660 --> 01:21:00.660]  Again, 800-876-2966.
[01:21:00.660 --> 01:21:03.660]  The question is, where should the American people
[01:21:03.660 --> 01:21:05.660]  draw their line in the sand?
[01:21:05.660 --> 01:21:06.660]  What have we got?
[01:21:06.660 --> 01:21:08.660]  A republic or a monarchy?
[01:21:08.660 --> 01:21:11.660]  A republic is based on a constitution
[01:21:11.660 --> 01:21:12.660]  which protects minority rights.
[01:21:12.660 --> 01:21:14.660]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[01:21:14.660 --> 01:21:16.660]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:21:16.660 --> 01:21:18.660]  So they think they own our land.
[01:21:18.660 --> 01:21:19.660]  They think they own our water.
[01:21:19.660 --> 01:21:22.660]  Children, our education, our money.
[01:21:22.660 --> 01:21:26.660]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[01:21:26.660 --> 01:21:28.660]  Somebody's going to ask you what you did
[01:21:28.660 --> 01:21:30.660]  during the Patriot Uprising.
[01:21:30.660 --> 01:21:31.660]  You have been warned.
[01:21:31.660 --> 01:21:32.660]  We have the facts.
[01:21:32.660 --> 01:21:33.660]  We have the Constitution.
[01:21:33.660 --> 01:21:34.660]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[01:21:34.660 --> 01:21:35.660]  We have common law.
[01:21:35.660 --> 01:21:37.660]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:21:37.660 --> 01:21:39.660]  and I'm so excited to be able to offer you
[01:21:39.660 --> 01:21:40.660]  Don't Tread on Me,
[01:21:40.660 --> 01:21:41.660]  Rise of the Republic.
[01:21:41.660 --> 01:21:42.660]  Tear any is upon us,
[01:21:42.660 --> 01:21:44.660]  but liberty and the sleeping giant
[01:21:44.660 --> 01:21:46.660]  that is the American people is rising.
[01:21:46.660 --> 01:21:48.660]  A new tool in the Info War.
[01:21:48.660 --> 01:21:49.660]  Don't Tread on Me.
[01:21:49.660 --> 01:21:51.660]  Order it at infowars.com
[01:21:51.660 --> 01:21:53.660]  or prisonplanet.com
[01:21:53.660 --> 01:21:56.660]  or call toll-free 888-253-3139
[01:21:56.660 --> 01:22:00.660]  and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[01:22:00.660 --> 01:22:02.660]  Have you ever felt like the United States government
[01:22:02.660 --> 01:22:04.660]  knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[01:22:04.660 --> 01:22:07.660]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures,
[01:22:07.660 --> 01:22:08.660]  frozen bank accounts,
[01:22:08.660 --> 01:22:10.660]  confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[01:22:10.660 --> 01:22:12.660]  It makes me wonder if the U.S. citizen
[01:22:12.660 --> 01:22:14.660]  will ever again have the right to life, liberty,
[01:22:14.660 --> 01:22:16.660]  and the pursuit of happiness.
[01:22:16.660 --> 01:22:19.660]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act,
[01:22:19.660 --> 01:22:22.660]  the IRS Revenue ruling 6045 of 1984,
[01:22:22.660 --> 01:22:24.660]  and the Trading with the Enemy Act
[01:22:24.660 --> 01:22:27.660]  and Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933,
[01:22:27.660 --> 01:22:29.660]  some precious metal holdings are subject
[01:22:29.660 --> 01:22:30.660]  to government intervention.
[01:22:30.660 --> 01:22:31.660]  For this reason,
[01:22:31.660 --> 01:22:33.660]  Midas Resources has prepared a report
[01:22:33.660 --> 01:22:36.660]  explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[01:22:36.660 --> 01:22:38.660]  Whether if you have any intention of trading
[01:22:38.660 --> 01:22:39.660]  with Midas Resources or not,
[01:22:39.660 --> 01:22:41.660]  I have instructed my representatives
[01:22:41.660 --> 01:22:42.660]  to give this report out free.
[01:22:42.660 --> 01:22:46.660]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:46.660 --> 01:22:48.660]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[01:22:48.660 --> 01:22:52.660]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:52.660 --> 01:22:55.660]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[01:22:55.660 --> 01:23:21.660]  1-800-686-2237.
[01:23:26.660 --> 01:23:28.660]  From the smallest to the largest systems,

[01:23:55.660 --> 01:24:24.660]  That's 1-877-99-BurkyWaterFilters.com
[01:24:24.660 --> 01:24:27.660]  Okay, Joel.
[01:24:27.660 --> 01:24:29.660]  It's key what you said here, though,
[01:24:29.660 --> 01:24:30.660]  because that's what they're doing.
[01:24:30.660 --> 01:24:32.660]  That's how I got this from preachers,
[01:24:32.660 --> 01:24:34.660]  is they tell the preachers,
[01:24:34.660 --> 01:24:36.660]  hey, would you like to get some federal funding
[01:24:36.660 --> 01:24:38.660]  to just be on the lookout for al-Qaeda?
[01:24:38.660 --> 01:24:41.660]  They have the same program for truck drivers
[01:24:41.660 --> 01:24:44.660]  and people in critical infrastructure or infra-guard.
[01:24:44.660 --> 01:24:46.660]  And you come down, the FBI pays for it,
[01:24:46.660 --> 01:24:48.660]  puts you in a hotel for the weekend.
[01:24:48.660 --> 01:24:51.660]  The first 10 minutes, they show al-Qaeda training videos.
[01:24:51.660 --> 01:24:53.660]  Then they cut to,
[01:24:53.660 --> 01:24:55.660]  is your neighbor spanking their kid?
[01:24:55.660 --> 01:24:57.660]  Do you smell marijuana?
[01:24:57.660 --> 01:24:59.660]  You know, is this person a patriot?
[01:24:59.660 --> 01:25:03.660]  I mean, we've gotten footage that people shot at these meetings.
[01:25:03.660 --> 01:25:05.660]  And the founding fathers were terrorists.
[01:25:05.660 --> 01:25:07.660]  I mean, I actually have video of this.
[01:25:07.660 --> 01:25:10.660]  And so they find out who buys into it.
[01:25:10.660 --> 01:25:13.660]  So 90% leave disgusted,
[01:25:13.660 --> 01:25:17.660]  but they find the 10% that either like the tyranny
[01:25:17.660 --> 01:25:19.660]  or are gullible.
[01:25:19.660 --> 01:25:22.660]  But as you said, just like it took them decades
[01:25:22.660 --> 01:25:26.660]  to make the dark side as big or bigger than the light side,
[01:25:26.660 --> 01:25:31.660]  now they're trying to take over any area of influence
[01:25:31.660 --> 01:25:33.660]  and convert it to the dark side.
[01:25:33.660 --> 01:25:36.660]  How long till they convert?
[01:25:36.660 --> 01:25:39.660]  Well, this is awfully hard to document
[01:25:39.660 --> 01:25:42.660]  because as I say, there is a great deal of
[01:25:42.660 --> 01:25:45.660]  signing documents saying that you won't reveal anything
[01:25:45.660 --> 01:25:47.660]  about what you're showing at these presentations.
[01:25:47.660 --> 01:25:49.660]  So it's very difficult to get people to talk.
[01:25:49.660 --> 01:25:52.660]  I can tell you that psychologically,
[01:25:52.660 --> 01:25:54.660]  they're really playing up in Christianity
[01:25:54.660 --> 01:25:57.660]  by making it a beleaguered profession
[01:25:57.660 --> 01:26:01.660]  or a beleaguered religion so that they induce people
[01:26:01.660 --> 01:26:04.660]  to want to get the protection of government.
[01:26:04.660 --> 01:26:07.660]  That's how they've duped in an awful lot
[01:26:07.660 --> 01:26:11.660]  of what used to be very, very conservative religious people,
[01:26:11.660 --> 01:26:15.660]  whether it was Fallwell or Dobson or many of those other people
[01:26:15.660 --> 01:26:19.660]  who got to buy into supporting the Republican establishment.
[01:26:19.660 --> 01:26:22.660]  Even though they were being betrayed by the Republican establishment
[01:26:22.660 --> 01:26:23.660]  during the Bush year,
[01:26:23.660 --> 01:26:28.660]  that elicitation of the concept that you can't be mainstream,
[01:26:28.660 --> 01:26:31.660]  you can be protected, we won't criticize you.
[01:26:31.660 --> 01:26:33.660]  We'll give you good press.
[01:26:33.660 --> 01:26:35.660]  We'll make sure that good articles are written on you
[01:26:35.660 --> 01:26:37.660]  in time in Newsweek.
[01:26:37.660 --> 01:26:39.660]  And that's what they got good press.
[01:26:39.660 --> 01:26:41.660]  And believe me, a lot of those people,
[01:26:41.660 --> 01:26:47.660]  because our true side, as you know, Alex has very, very limited funding.
[01:26:47.660 --> 01:26:52.660]  And everybody's looking out for...
[01:26:52.660 --> 01:26:54.660]  And they find out when you take a hard-line stand
[01:26:54.660 --> 01:26:56.660]  that your funding kind of drives up.
[01:26:56.660 --> 01:26:58.660]  And that's one of the reasons why I'm really skeptical
[01:26:58.660 --> 01:27:01.660]  of what happened to the Tea Party when you have big-dollar people
[01:27:01.660 --> 01:27:05.660]  come in and start to finance things within the Tea Parties.
[01:27:05.660 --> 01:27:07.660]  They find out they're not on our side.
[01:27:07.660 --> 01:27:08.660]  It's foreign money coming in.
[01:27:08.660 --> 01:27:10.660]  It's money from the establishment trying to take over things.
[01:27:10.660 --> 01:27:15.660]  And that's what's happened in our religious views as well.
[01:27:15.660 --> 01:27:17.660]  But I can't tell you, in answer to your question,
[01:27:17.660 --> 01:27:19.660]  how far they've got along.
[01:27:19.660 --> 01:27:22.660]  I do know that they're making steady progress.
[01:27:22.660 --> 01:27:25.660]  And they're converting one person at a time.
[01:27:25.660 --> 01:27:29.660]  And it's just like that in the private military contractor.
[01:27:29.660 --> 01:27:31.660]  They're going through a sifting process.
[01:27:31.660 --> 01:27:33.660]  That's why this is not about to end.
[01:27:33.660 --> 01:27:36.660]  The story about cars that are threatening to throw out
[01:27:36.660 --> 01:27:39.660]  private military contractors within four months in Afghanistan
[01:27:39.660 --> 01:27:42.660]  so I can guarantee you will not happen.
[01:27:42.660 --> 01:27:44.660]  Absolutely will not happen.
[01:27:44.660 --> 01:27:48.660]  Whether or not he's even being sincere in saying this, I'm not sure.
[01:27:48.660 --> 01:27:51.660]  Because he may be doing it to protect his own survival
[01:27:51.660 --> 01:27:54.660]  within Afghanistan, which is growing in hatred
[01:27:54.660 --> 01:27:58.660]  against the sabotage of private military contractors.
[01:27:58.660 --> 01:28:01.660]  He even mentioned on one of the news shows
[01:28:01.660 --> 01:28:03.660]  that they've been involved in terrorism.
[01:28:03.660 --> 01:28:06.660]  And they're basically acting as a cover for the dark side
[01:28:06.660 --> 01:28:09.660]  of us DIA activities who do control their own set of terrorists
[01:28:09.660 --> 01:28:11.660]  for conflict creation.
[01:28:11.660 --> 01:28:14.660]  And the private military contractors are increasing
[01:28:14.660 --> 01:28:16.660]  and taking those roles.
[01:28:16.660 --> 01:28:18.660]  Because when they use military people to do it,
[01:28:18.660 --> 01:28:20.660]  they have too many whistleblowers.
[01:28:20.660 --> 01:28:23.660]  Exactly, it gives another membrane of deniability.
[01:28:23.660 --> 01:28:25.660]  But you just mentioned something key.
[01:28:25.660 --> 01:28:28.660]  Contractors staging their own terror attacks.
[01:28:28.660 --> 01:28:31.660]  They've caught British SAS operating as contractors
[01:28:31.660 --> 01:28:34.660]  and others dressed up as Muslims
[01:28:34.660 --> 01:28:36.660]  attacking our installations.
[01:28:36.660 --> 01:28:39.660]  And that's the reports that come out again and again and again.
[01:28:39.660 --> 01:28:43.660]  If you've got a trillion dollar a year global war machine,
[01:28:43.660 --> 01:28:46.660]  of course it's going to create the enemy.
[01:28:46.660 --> 01:28:49.660]  And if it has to stage its own attacks
[01:28:49.660 --> 01:28:54.660]  as a pretext to continue that war of global domination.
[01:28:54.660 --> 01:28:57.660]  Well, as we've talked about in our last interview,
[01:28:57.660 --> 01:29:01.660]  I think the motive is not simply the industrial military complex
[01:29:01.660 --> 01:29:04.660]  and gaining more riches and making people...
[01:29:04.660 --> 01:29:08.660]  That's always an inducement, to be sure, but it's not the main goal.
[01:29:08.660 --> 01:29:12.660]  I think the main goal is to create constant warfare
[01:29:12.660 --> 01:29:15.660]  for the purpose of rearranging the chess pieces
[01:29:15.660 --> 01:29:18.660]  on the world chess board of governments
[01:29:18.660 --> 01:29:20.660]  and working towards a new world order government.
[01:29:20.660 --> 01:29:22.660]  I know you agree with that.
[01:29:22.660 --> 01:29:25.660]  But we must lose sight of the fact
[01:29:25.660 --> 01:29:29.660]  that these more ethereal goals about creating conflict
[01:29:29.660 --> 01:29:32.660]  for the purpose of even larger wars
[01:29:32.660 --> 01:29:34.660]  and rearranging governments on the space of the world
[01:29:34.660 --> 01:29:35.660]  is what they're really after.
[01:29:35.660 --> 01:29:37.660]  All right, Joel, stay there. Long segment coming up.
[01:29:37.660 --> 01:29:39.660]  Let's continue to break this down.
[01:29:39.660 --> 01:29:41.660]  Take phone calls. Get into a host of subjects.
[01:29:41.660 --> 01:29:43.660]  Straight ahead. Stay with us.
[01:29:50.660 --> 01:29:54.660]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.660 --> 01:29:59.660]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[01:29:59.660 --> 01:30:01.660]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons
[01:30:01.660 --> 01:30:04.660]  you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:30:04.660 --> 01:30:08.660]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:30:08.660 --> 01:30:10.660]  Number two, our new energies are
[01:30:10.660 --> 01:30:14.660]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:30:14.660 --> 01:30:17.660]  It's true. Total government control of electricity
[01:30:17.660 --> 01:30:19.660]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:30:19.660 --> 01:30:22.660]  Number three, in some areas of the country,
[01:30:22.660 --> 01:30:24.660]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:30:24.660 --> 01:30:26.660]  And now, new socialist legislation
[01:30:26.660 --> 01:30:28.660]  is only compounding the problem.
[01:30:28.660 --> 01:30:31.660]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:30:31.660 --> 01:30:33.660]  Every year, thousands of families
[01:30:33.660 --> 01:30:35.660]  lose their power from weather-related onages.
[01:30:35.660 --> 01:30:37.660]  Number five, a solar power generator
[01:30:37.660 --> 01:30:40.660]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:30:40.660 --> 01:30:42.660]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators

[01:31:12.660 --> 01:31:14.660]  from eFoodsDirect.com.

[01:31:36.660 --> 01:31:39.660]  the crisis in the Gulf, and possible evacuations.

[01:31:59.660 --> 01:32:01.660]  When you're out on the road,
[01:32:01.660 --> 01:32:06.660]  the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:32:06.660 --> 01:32:08.660]  But if the unfortunate happens,
[01:32:08.660 --> 01:32:11.660]  you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:32:11.660 --> 01:32:15.660]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[01:32:15.660 --> 01:32:20.660]  where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:32:20.660 --> 01:32:24.660]  They so pride in every stitch,
[01:32:24.660 --> 01:32:28.660]  guarantee you love the way they fit.
[01:32:28.660 --> 01:32:31.660]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch
[01:32:31.660 --> 01:32:33.660]  where you need it most.
[01:32:33.660 --> 01:32:38.660]  Blue diamond gussets got it, others don't.
[01:32:38.660 --> 01:32:42.660]  We turned jeans inside out, diamond gusset jeans,
[01:32:42.660 --> 01:32:45.660]  made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:32:45.660 --> 01:32:47.660]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine
[01:32:47.660 --> 01:32:49.660]  gusset comfort with Kevlar protection,
[01:32:49.660 --> 01:32:52.660]  so you can ride all day with confidence.
[01:32:52.660 --> 01:32:54.660]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[01:32:54.660 --> 01:33:13.660]  Diamond gusset jeans got it, others don't.
[01:33:25.660 --> 01:33:29.660]  Okay, I got a lot of questions I want to throw at Joel Scalzen
[01:33:29.660 --> 01:33:33.660]  just to get his view on the mosque situation at Ground Zero,
[01:33:33.660 --> 01:33:36.660]  the Bloomberg saying that most analysts agree
[01:33:36.660 --> 01:33:40.660]  that gold's going to be $1,500 announced by December,
[01:33:40.660 --> 01:33:42.660]  what's happening with our economy,
[01:33:42.660 --> 01:33:45.660]  but also bigger issues like,
[01:33:45.660 --> 01:33:47.660]  what are they getting the chessboard ready for?
[01:33:47.660 --> 01:33:50.660]  If the globalists could have everything they wanted now,
[01:33:50.660 --> 01:33:53.660]  what type of world would they build from his research?
[01:33:53.660 --> 01:33:55.660]  What is their end game?
[01:33:55.660 --> 01:33:57.660]  I mean, I know what their end game is,
[01:33:57.660 --> 01:33:59.660]  but I want to get his perspective on that.
[01:33:59.660 --> 01:34:01.660]  I mean, I've got it right here from the UN.
[01:34:01.660 --> 01:34:04.660]  It's global population reduction,
[01:34:04.660 --> 01:34:07.660]  and the end of humanity as we know it.
[01:34:07.660 --> 01:34:12.660]  A total control freak wonderland
[01:34:12.660 --> 01:34:16.660]  where you've got basically a genetically engineered
[01:34:16.660 --> 01:34:20.660]  suboid servant class serving the global controllers,
[01:34:20.660 --> 01:34:22.660]  but we'll get Joel Scalzen's take on that.
[01:34:22.660 --> 01:34:24.660]  And yeah, it sounds like science fiction.
[01:34:24.660 --> 01:34:26.660]  It's the 21st century, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:34:26.660 --> 01:34:29.660]  This has been their plan for at least 100 years.
[01:34:29.660 --> 01:34:33.660]  Before we go back to Joel Scalzen of worldaffairsbrief.com,
[01:34:33.660 --> 01:34:38.660]  I wanted to let folks know this is the most popular, special we've ever done.
[01:34:38.660 --> 01:34:43.660]  We're offering five films for $9.95.
[01:34:43.660 --> 01:34:46.660]  Five of my documentary films.
[01:34:46.660 --> 01:34:49.660]  Well, one of the films is one I consulted on,
[01:34:49.660 --> 01:34:52.660]  but the point is it exposes the phony drug war,
[01:34:52.660 --> 01:34:54.660]  how we'd won the West.
[01:34:54.660 --> 01:34:58.660]  But Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terrorism,
[01:34:58.660 --> 01:35:02.660]  American dictators shattering the left-right paradigm,
[01:35:02.660 --> 01:35:05.660]  Aaron Russo's Reflections and Warnings,
[01:35:05.660 --> 01:35:08.660]  minor view with Aaron Russo to documentary,
[01:35:08.660 --> 01:35:11.660]  fabled enemies exposing the synthetic stage terror of 9-11,
[01:35:11.660 --> 01:35:13.660]  excellent Jason Burmese film,
[01:35:13.660 --> 01:35:17.660]  and how we'd won the West $9.95,
[01:35:17.660 --> 01:35:20.660]  and this special will end next week.
[01:35:20.660 --> 01:35:23.660]  So if you want to take advantage of it, infowars.com.
[01:35:23.660 --> 01:35:25.660]  We've got a bunch of other specials,
[01:35:25.660 --> 01:35:29.660]  where you buy one of Jesse Ventura's new book, American Conspiracies,
[01:35:29.660 --> 01:35:32.660]  and you get a free film of your choice,
[01:35:32.660 --> 01:35:35.660]  including the Obama Deception or Fall of the Republic.
[01:35:35.660 --> 01:35:39.660]  We've got a bunch of deals where you buy two of our latest DVDs,
[01:35:39.660 --> 01:35:40.660]  get one free.
[01:35:40.660 --> 01:35:42.660]  We've got deals where you can get t-shirts for $5.95.
[01:35:42.660 --> 01:35:44.660]  The things cost me at least $5.
[01:35:44.660 --> 01:35:48.660]  I just want to get these information warfare weapons out to people.
[01:35:48.660 --> 01:35:51.660]  Nothing is waking folks up like these documentaries.
[01:35:51.660 --> 01:35:55.660]  And of those five, I think the most powerful is Terror Storm.
[01:35:55.660 --> 01:35:59.660]  You're talking about more than 10 hours of powerful footage,
[01:35:59.660 --> 01:36:03.660]  $9.95, infowars.com,
[01:36:03.660 --> 01:36:08.660]  or call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[01:36:08.660 --> 01:36:11.660]  And thank you for your purchase of the books, the films, the t-shirts.
[01:36:11.660 --> 01:36:13.660]  We couldn't have this radio broadcast without you.
[01:36:13.660 --> 01:36:17.660]  Thank you for all of you out there that have prisonplanet.tv memberships.
[01:36:17.660 --> 01:36:19.660]  Again, it's $0.15 a day, $5.95 a month,
[01:36:19.660 --> 01:36:21.660]  get a yearly membership, get three months free.
[01:36:21.660 --> 01:36:24.660]  But this is the best deal we've ever offered.
[01:36:24.660 --> 01:36:28.660]  Five films, $9.95, that's basically at cost.
[01:36:28.660 --> 01:36:30.660]  I think we've done the math we make about...
[01:36:30.660 --> 01:36:32.660]  No, no, that's not true.
[01:36:32.660 --> 01:36:35.660]  Because I had to pay $6 a piece for that weed one in the West.
[01:36:35.660 --> 01:36:37.660]  I actually lose money on this. I'm sorry.
[01:36:37.660 --> 01:36:41.660]  I was counting it as one of my films, like $1.50 a piece or so.
[01:36:41.660 --> 01:36:43.660]  So the point is I'm losing money on this.
[01:36:43.660 --> 01:36:45.660]  I just want to get them out to people.
[01:36:45.660 --> 01:36:48.660]  $9.95, infowars.com.
[01:36:48.660 --> 01:36:52.660]  Okay, going back to Joel Scalson, great analyst and researcher,
[01:36:52.660 --> 01:36:57.660]  finish up with the point you were making before the break,
[01:36:57.660 --> 01:37:01.660]  and then whatever you think is most important today,
[01:37:01.660 --> 01:37:03.660]  then I want to take some phone calls.
[01:37:03.660 --> 01:37:06.660]  And when we start the next hour, I'll continue with calls,
[01:37:06.660 --> 01:37:10.660]  but I've got a laundry list of questions that I want to go over with you today,
[01:37:10.660 --> 01:37:12.660]  Joel Scalson.
[01:37:12.660 --> 01:37:15.660]  But what is most concerning you right now?
[01:37:15.660 --> 01:37:17.660]  What do you think is most important right now?
[01:37:17.660 --> 01:37:22.660]  It sounds like, going to break, you were hinting the co-opting of the Tea Party,
[01:37:22.660 --> 01:37:25.660]  which we know was founded by the Ron Paul movement.
[01:37:25.660 --> 01:37:27.660]  He wrote an editorial that was published yesterday.
[01:37:27.660 --> 01:37:33.660]  It's up on infowars.com saying that the Republicans are controlled
[01:37:33.660 --> 01:37:36.660]  by the very same globalist, where they have better rhetoric,
[01:37:36.660 --> 01:37:41.660]  they are the same people, and basically warning that Sarah Palin and Glenn Beck
[01:37:41.660 --> 01:37:48.660]  are bad news, and that they're not really giving people the truth.
[01:37:48.660 --> 01:37:51.660]  But Joel Scalson, what do you think is most important?
[01:37:51.660 --> 01:37:55.660]  Before I go into some of those big picture items, and it's very true,
[01:37:55.660 --> 01:38:02.660]  the co-opting of the resistance movement is the most important criteria for them right now.
[01:38:02.660 --> 01:38:04.660]  And I'll explain, I think, how they're doing that.
[01:38:04.660 --> 01:38:07.660]  But before we leave the secret America thing,
[01:38:07.660 --> 01:38:11.660]  I really want to take a few minutes to give some very good specifics to your audience
[01:38:11.660 --> 01:38:15.660]  about how they recruit people, how they operate within the dark side,
[01:38:15.660 --> 01:38:19.660]  how they get people to cross over from the white side to the dark side.
[01:38:19.660 --> 01:38:22.660]  Because I think this is fascinating to people, and they need to understand this
[01:38:22.660 --> 01:38:27.660]  when their children go into the military, or when they naively going to work for the FBI,
[01:38:27.660 --> 01:38:33.660]  or the CIA, or the DEA, how this process happens.
[01:38:33.660 --> 01:38:37.660]  Oftentimes we stay too general, and I want to give some specifics before we go on.
[01:38:37.660 --> 01:38:41.660]  I once had a friend of mine who happened to be a Mormon.
[01:38:41.660 --> 01:38:44.660]  A lot of Mormons are recruited into the CIA and the FBI,
[01:38:44.660 --> 01:38:47.660]  because they've got that clean cut image, and they are very pro-American,
[01:38:47.660 --> 01:38:49.660]  they are very patriotic.
[01:38:49.660 --> 01:38:53.660]  Well, he got assigned overseas, because a lot of Mormon return missionaries
[01:38:53.660 --> 01:38:57.660]  have these language skills, they speak all the languages of the world,
[01:38:57.660 --> 01:39:01.660]  and that's why they're very anxious to get them into the CIA.
[01:39:01.660 --> 01:39:05.660]  So he got assigned overseas, and he was at a hotel one night,
[01:39:05.660 --> 01:39:08.660]  and he got a knock on the door, and there was a very good looking woman,
[01:39:08.660 --> 01:39:11.660]  and she was there to offer her services.
[01:39:11.660 --> 01:39:16.660]  And he said, no, no, I don't do that kind of thing, I'm not introducing.
[01:39:16.660 --> 01:39:19.660]  She said, no, no, it's okay, it's already paid for.
[01:39:19.660 --> 01:39:21.660]  He said, well, paid for by who?
[01:39:21.660 --> 01:39:25.660]  And he said, you know, I eat the company, your agency.
[01:39:25.660 --> 01:39:27.660]  And he was kind of shocked.
[01:39:27.660 --> 01:39:31.660]  He just, oh, come on, you know, he said, no, no, it's all paid for, you know,
[01:39:31.660 --> 01:39:32.660]  can I come in?
[01:39:32.660 --> 01:39:35.660]  And he said, no, they shut the door on her.
[01:39:35.660 --> 01:39:38.660]  Well, the next morning he talked to some of his other cohorts,
[01:39:38.660 --> 01:39:41.660]  and they'd all had similar knocks on the door.
[01:39:41.660 --> 01:39:44.660]  And most of them had accepted.
[01:39:44.660 --> 01:39:48.660]  And he said, from that time on, his career went nowhere.
[01:39:48.660 --> 01:39:53.660]  Yeah, he could still say the CIA, but he was not getting promoted.
[01:39:53.660 --> 01:39:57.660]  He was not, in fact, he was hinted at in his annual review and said,
[01:39:57.660 --> 01:40:00.660]  well, you know, you're just going to kind of stay at the same level.
[01:40:00.660 --> 01:40:02.660]  And that was only the first test.
[01:40:02.660 --> 01:40:07.660]  And then we see skull and bones that founded CIA, homosexual type activity.
[01:40:07.660 --> 01:40:11.660]  And at Bohemian Grove, Nixon wouldn't protect, but he told Harper's magazine
[01:40:11.660 --> 01:40:15.660]  that basically to get involved in California politics,
[01:40:15.660 --> 01:40:18.660]  you got to go in there and have gay sex.
[01:40:18.660 --> 01:40:22.660]  And so if he would have had sex with that, you know, number 10 hooker,
[01:40:22.660 --> 01:40:24.660]  and I've never been in an intelligence agency,
[01:40:24.660 --> 01:40:30.660]  but I've had him send beautiful hookers at me, same deal, repeatedly.
[01:40:30.660 --> 01:40:36.660]  But side issue, the point is, then if you accept that, it gets worse and worse.
[01:40:36.660 --> 01:40:40.660]  Serpico, of course, the New York City narcotics detective,
[01:40:40.660 --> 01:40:44.660]  it was, hey, take this free diamond necklace, give it to your girlfriend.
[01:40:44.660 --> 01:40:45.660]  No, I'm not going to take it.
[01:40:45.660 --> 01:40:48.660]  And his partner slammed the brakes on and said,
[01:40:48.660 --> 01:40:50.660]  well, you're not going to be part of this team.
[01:40:50.660 --> 01:40:53.660]  But Joel, please continue.
[01:40:53.660 --> 01:40:57.660]  Yeah, what I'm trying to get at is that there are ways in which there's a corruption
[01:40:57.660 --> 01:41:01.660]  is always the issue that got to make sure that you're morally corruptible.
[01:41:01.660 --> 01:41:06.660]  Because they do not want, they like to have people who have a clean cut appearance
[01:41:06.660 --> 01:41:10.660]  who can fool other people, but they want to make sure that they're corruptible.
[01:41:10.660 --> 01:41:17.660]  And that's why in the military, a lot of the CIA now recruiters are military officers.
[01:41:17.660 --> 01:41:20.660]  They're basically taken aside by the CIA.
[01:41:20.660 --> 01:41:21.660]  They say, hey, you've done really well.
[01:41:21.660 --> 01:41:22.660]  We want you to recruit for us.
[01:41:22.660 --> 01:41:27.660]  They don't even have to be corrupt themselves, but they usually are.
[01:41:27.660 --> 01:41:32.660]  But generally speaking, they're meant to look out and taught how to psychologically profile
[01:41:32.660 --> 01:41:35.660]  people that they want to bring in undercover under the CIA.
[01:41:35.660 --> 01:41:38.660]  That's how Timothy Bovee got recruited.
[01:41:38.660 --> 01:41:42.660]  It's very interesting that Timothy Bovee, I'll tell this specific incident,
[01:41:42.660 --> 01:41:43.660]  that he was in the military.
[01:41:43.660 --> 01:41:46.660]  He was doing a lot of, really doing well.
[01:41:46.660 --> 01:41:47.660]  He had a lot of good reports.
[01:41:47.660 --> 01:41:49.660]  He was very people's oriented.
[01:41:49.660 --> 01:41:50.660]  He had a good leadership report.
[01:41:50.660 --> 01:41:54.660]  He got recruited into the CIA by one of his officers.
[01:41:54.660 --> 01:41:59.660]  And what they do, it's just like CIA sheep dipping people or calling them out of the service.
[01:41:59.660 --> 01:42:02.660]  They go to work for someone in the private sector.
[01:42:02.660 --> 01:42:07.660]  And in this case, but they're always missing for about a year or two.
[01:42:07.660 --> 01:42:08.660]  Timothy Bovee was missing.
[01:42:08.660 --> 01:42:11.660]  He had no contact with his family for over a year.
[01:42:11.660 --> 01:42:17.660]  And when he finally surfaced to show up to take a job at various private security companies,
[01:42:17.660 --> 01:42:23.660]  and the CIA has a lot of operators that deal with private security companies like Wackenhead
[01:42:23.660 --> 01:42:26.660]  and others that are essentially CIA fronts.
[01:42:26.660 --> 01:42:30.660]  That's how they get their agents and work their deals in the prison.
[01:42:30.660 --> 01:42:35.660]  That's how they put the screws on people in prisons because they can essentially get
[01:42:35.660 --> 01:42:38.660]  things done through these private agencies.
[01:42:38.660 --> 01:42:44.660]  And all of a sudden, his modus operandi changed.
[01:42:44.660 --> 01:42:49.660]  His report said that he couldn't be trusted to deal with other people.
[01:42:49.660 --> 01:42:50.660]  He'd fly off at the handle.
[01:42:50.660 --> 01:42:52.660]  He was very argumentative.
[01:42:52.660 --> 01:42:56.660]  If you gave him a specific assignment, yes, stand guard at this particular door.
[01:42:56.660 --> 01:42:57.660]  He'd do that just fine.
[01:42:57.660 --> 01:43:00.660]  But he was incapable of thinking for himself anymore.
[01:43:00.660 --> 01:43:02.660]  He had to be told everything.
[01:43:02.660 --> 01:43:09.660]  Now, that's at complete variance to what his record was in the military before he was recruited out.
[01:43:09.660 --> 01:43:12.660]  Now, some people suspect that during this two-year period,
[01:43:12.660 --> 01:43:20.660]  there'd be people that are being trained to do a suicide attack or something like he did at Oklahoma City Bombing,
[01:43:20.660 --> 01:43:24.660]  going to some form of drug therapy, mind control, and other things.
[01:43:24.660 --> 01:43:27.660]  Now, as I've studied the mind control issue, Alex,
[01:43:27.660 --> 01:43:33.660]  I don't believe they can take normal people and change them against their will,
[01:43:33.660 --> 01:43:38.660]  but they can take corruptible people under the influence of drugs and severe hospital type training
[01:43:38.660 --> 01:43:45.660]  and destabilize them to the point where they make them extremely subjective to hypnosis
[01:43:45.660 --> 01:43:47.660]  and to demands of leadership and control.
[01:43:47.660 --> 01:43:48.660]  Well, sure.
[01:43:48.660 --> 01:43:53.660]  But we know that Jolly and West, the number two mind control doctor under Ewing Cameron,
[01:43:53.660 --> 01:43:58.660]  even in the MKUltra congressional hearings, was with him from the time he was arrested
[01:43:58.660 --> 01:44:01.660]  till the time he was executed.
[01:44:01.660 --> 01:44:04.660]  And nobody in the mainstream media said,
[01:44:04.660 --> 01:44:08.660]  why is a top mind control doctor, McVeigh's psychiatrist?
[01:44:08.660 --> 01:44:10.660]  And you would watch him on the news.
[01:44:10.660 --> 01:44:12.660]  He was bombed out of his mind.
[01:44:12.660 --> 01:44:15.660]  I mean, I'm not a cop who's an expert on somebody on drugs,
[01:44:15.660 --> 01:44:19.660]  but you can look at somebody when their eyes are glassy and they're clearly on drugs.
[01:44:19.660 --> 01:44:23.660]  I mean, McVeigh in those 60-minute interviews looked like a drughead
[01:44:23.660 --> 01:44:27.660]  versus people that were near him in the jails.
[01:44:27.660 --> 01:44:29.660]  And I've interviewed some of them.
[01:44:29.660 --> 01:44:32.660]  And McVeigh was like, look, I was recruited into the CIA.
[01:44:32.660 --> 01:44:37.660]  We know he was videotaped at a demolition space a year and a half after he was supposedly out.
[01:44:37.660 --> 01:44:39.660]  We know that's confirmed.
[01:44:39.660 --> 01:44:44.660]  Of course, Terry Nichols has now signed a sworn affidavit that McVeigh said he was being set up.
[01:44:44.660 --> 01:44:50.660]  So instead of just mind control, clearly mind control and drugged, so he's incoherent once they've caught him.
[01:44:50.660 --> 01:44:58.660]  But he thought he was part of a larger operation to set up the white supremacist Southern Poverty Law Center run.
[01:44:58.660 --> 01:45:01.660]  It came out in federal documents and that he was being set up.
[01:45:01.660 --> 01:45:04.660]  And clearly he was then finally set up.
[01:45:04.660 --> 01:45:08.660]  So it's kind of like Lee Harvey Oswald, who we now know is admitted CIA.
[01:45:08.660 --> 01:45:09.660]  Right.
[01:45:09.660 --> 01:45:10.660]  And set up.
[01:45:10.660 --> 01:45:11.660]  But look at the pattern here.
[01:45:11.660 --> 01:45:16.660]  John Hinckley, the assassin of Ronald Reagan, disappeared for two years.
[01:45:16.660 --> 01:45:18.660]  His parents didn't know where he was.
[01:45:18.660 --> 01:45:29.660]  He surfaced on the once and that was to fulfill an appointment with a psychiatrist to set up his bona fide that someone who had mental problems which provided his defense.
[01:45:29.660 --> 01:45:36.660]  And he was world vision and so was the guy that shot, of course, the famous Beatle.
[01:45:36.660 --> 01:45:38.660]  So John Lennon.
[01:45:38.660 --> 01:45:39.660]  John Lennon, right.
[01:45:39.660 --> 01:45:45.660]  And they love to use missionary fronts as mind control camps because it's overseas.
[01:45:45.660 --> 01:45:46.660]  That's right.
[01:45:46.660 --> 01:45:52.660]  I mean, even going back to Jack Anderson, the follow on journalist, yellow journalist after Drew Pearson,
[01:45:52.660 --> 01:46:00.660]  Jack Anderson came home as a Mormon missionary, disappeared for two years, surfaced in China of all places.
[01:46:00.660 --> 01:46:02.660]  Didn't speak Chinese.
[01:46:02.660 --> 01:46:09.660]  But surfaced in China had undergone language training and then suddenly came out and went into the journalistic world working for Drew Pearson.
[01:46:09.660 --> 01:46:11.660]  Well, the guy was never active as a Mormon again.
[01:46:11.660 --> 01:46:13.660]  He had lost his principles.
[01:46:13.660 --> 01:46:14.660]  He was immoral.
[01:46:14.660 --> 01:46:17.660]  He had all these, you know, bad habits.
[01:46:17.660 --> 01:46:26.660]  But how do you just disappear, come out of China and then go work for Drew Pearson in a major Washington Marigold around the scenario?
[01:46:26.660 --> 01:46:34.660]  It's very interesting that later on in his life, he kind of had a bout of repentance that he told Howard Ruff,
[01:46:34.660 --> 01:46:37.660]  started to, you know, get to him about, you know, I've got to change.
[01:46:37.660 --> 01:46:39.660]  I've been at the black side for so many years.
[01:46:39.660 --> 01:46:41.660]  I've got to get out of this.
[01:46:41.660 --> 01:46:45.660]  I'm going to get killed and kind of had a mea culpa moment.
[01:46:45.660 --> 01:46:51.660]  And unfortunately, he never got out, even though he tried to turn around and tried to lead the dark side.
[01:46:51.660 --> 01:47:01.660]  He was, he never told tales about how he got to where he was and who was controlling him during the day.
[01:47:01.660 --> 01:47:06.660]  Who was feeding him information from the left when he was sabotaging Anastasia, the most of Nicaragua,
[01:47:06.660 --> 01:47:13.660]  and doing the hatchet job that people like, you know, the special reporters that work for the CIA do.
[01:47:13.660 --> 01:47:16.660]  As Drew Pearson used to do, he did a hatchet job on General Patton.
[01:47:16.660 --> 01:47:22.660]  He was the one who revealed the slapping incident. Come to find out, of course, Paul S. Allen,
[01:47:22.660 --> 01:47:27.660]  his partner in Washington, Maryland, used to be on the staff of General Patton.
[01:47:27.660 --> 01:47:31.660]  And he is suspected of having leaked the information to Pearson.
[01:47:31.660 --> 01:47:37.660]  And that's how John Paul S. Allen got a delete with Pearson later on after he, uh, Patton was killed.
[01:47:37.660 --> 01:47:40.660]  Uh, they did a hatchet job on Forest Hall.
[01:47:40.660 --> 01:47:48.660]  Uh, the admiral, you know, who was, uh, like MacArthur, trying to have a strong defense against Truman's, uh, sabotage.
[01:47:48.660 --> 01:47:54.660]  Forest Hall then ended up being thrown out of a window at Bethesda Naval Hospital and ruled a suicide.
[01:47:54.660 --> 01:47:58.660]  I mean, dark stuff in this government is just incredible.
[01:47:58.660 --> 01:48:01.660]  What we know is just the tip of the iceberg.
[01:48:01.660 --> 01:48:09.660]  And now we know it's a giant submerged iceberg and I agree with you that they've converted more than half of the people
[01:48:09.660 --> 01:48:15.660]  in these private and public bureaucracies, uh, into the dark side where they're compromised.
[01:48:15.660 --> 01:48:18.660]  And that's why I speak to them so often on air.
[01:48:18.660 --> 01:48:23.660]  And I point out, look, you're going to be destroyed at the end of this.
[01:48:23.660 --> 01:48:30.660]  And in every case in history, when these tyrannies fully come to power, which the systems attempting to do right now,
[01:48:30.660 --> 01:48:37.660]  the first group they wipe out are the people that brought them to power because you know where the bodies are buried
[01:48:37.660 --> 01:48:40.660]  and you understand how to overthrow them.
[01:48:40.660 --> 01:48:46.660]  And so you are in more danger than somebody who's on the light side, who's actually fighting the dark side.
[01:48:46.660 --> 01:48:53.660]  But once you've ever taken anything from the dark side, they then see it that they own you.
[01:48:53.660 --> 01:48:56.660]  It's almost like a spiritual principle.
[01:48:56.660 --> 01:48:59.660]  And I've seen more and more historians talk about this.
[01:48:59.660 --> 01:49:00.660]  I've experienced it.
[01:49:00.660 --> 01:49:03.660]  I have never done anything on the dark side.
[01:49:03.660 --> 01:49:11.660]  I have never compromised in any way, and it's almost like the globalists will demonize you and try to stop you,
[01:49:11.660 --> 01:49:16.660]  but they a lot of times don't physically come after you.
[01:49:16.660 --> 01:49:22.660]  I've seen them though really go after their minions if they ever try to wake up.
[01:49:22.660 --> 01:49:23.660]  It's really true.
[01:49:23.660 --> 01:49:24.660]  They are disposable.
[01:49:24.660 --> 01:49:31.660]  And I really, if any of those people are listening, I mean, there's hundreds of people out there who are demolition experts
[01:49:31.660 --> 01:49:33.660]  who have charges in the World Trade Center.
[01:49:33.660 --> 01:49:39.660]  There are hundreds and thousands of people who worked on underground military bases and other special prison camps
[01:49:39.660 --> 01:49:40.660]  that built these facilities.
[01:49:40.660 --> 01:49:44.660]  And believe me, it's amazing how well they keep the secret of what they're doing.
[01:49:44.660 --> 01:49:49.660]  Think of the Greenbrier and the underground bunker system that was built there.
[01:49:49.660 --> 01:49:56.660]  And literally they had hundreds and hundreds of workers building this very interesting underground bunker system.
[01:49:56.660 --> 01:49:59.660]  And the word simply did not leak out.
[01:49:59.660 --> 01:50:01.660]  It was just incredible how they did it.
[01:50:01.660 --> 01:50:04.660]  But we need whistleblowers to come forward.
[01:50:04.660 --> 01:50:11.660]  That's the reason, Alex, that they've gone to private military contractors rather than people in the military.
[01:50:11.660 --> 01:50:18.660]  They did it all through the 80s of trying to swear military people to secrecy, people who flew drugs in their helicopters down to South America
[01:50:18.660 --> 01:50:23.660]  during the Iran contra thing, who flew it back to main Arkansas.
[01:50:23.660 --> 01:50:31.660]  They had an open mic when Bill Clinton was on board and talking about how much money he was getting from the Arkansas bond fund
[01:50:31.660 --> 01:50:34.660]  and his relationship with the TIA.
[01:50:34.660 --> 01:50:35.660]  And he had an open mic.
[01:50:35.660 --> 01:50:38.660]  Didn't realize the pilots were hearing it.
[01:50:38.660 --> 01:50:41.660]  And of course the pilots had to be threatened to death to keep the secret.
[01:50:41.660 --> 01:50:43.660]  They eventually leak things out.
[01:50:43.660 --> 01:50:45.660]  We need more leakers if anybody's listening.
[01:50:45.660 --> 01:50:51.660]  Stay there. Let's come back and take calls and we'll get back into leakers and how we can bring this system down.
[01:50:51.660 --> 01:50:53.660]  Joel Scalsons, our guest. I'm Alex Jones.
[01:50:53.660 --> 01:50:55.660]  WorldofPrayersBrief.com.

[01:54:04.660 --> 01:54:07.660]  Joel Scalson, World Affairs Brief, is our guest.
[01:54:07.660 --> 01:54:09.660]  And we're going to be going to your phone calls here.
[01:54:09.660 --> 01:54:14.660]  I've got a bunch of other questions that I want to get Joel's expert take on.
[01:54:14.660 --> 01:54:16.660]  But I do before he leaves us.
[01:54:16.660 --> 01:54:19.660]  So remind me if I forget, Joel, sometime in the next hour.
[01:54:19.660 --> 01:54:29.660]  Let's get back into your ideas of how to get contractors or government people to safely be able to blow the whistle.
[01:54:29.660 --> 01:54:32.660]  Because they can have them sign agreements or whatever.
[01:54:32.660 --> 01:54:37.660]  There's no Nuremberg defense of just following orders, as you know.
[01:54:37.660 --> 01:54:41.660]  But they're fully aware of the fact that they're under surveillance.
[01:54:41.660 --> 01:54:44.660]  And they've got watchers watching the watchers.
[01:54:44.660 --> 01:54:50.660]  And that's why they spend, what, 500, 600, 700 billion on budget for Black Ops a year?
[01:54:50.660 --> 01:54:53.660]  A trillion plus on defense.
[01:54:53.660 --> 01:55:00.660]  A lot of it is economic saboteurs spying on other corporations than giving it to the Chinese.
[01:55:00.660 --> 01:55:02.660]  This is the globalist model.
[01:55:02.660 --> 01:55:04.660]  Bring the American people under control.
[01:55:04.660 --> 01:55:05.660]  So we'll talk more about that.
[01:55:05.660 --> 01:55:08.660]  But Jason, Michael, Paul, Christopher, Kenneth, you've been holding patiently.
[01:55:08.660 --> 01:55:10.660]  We're going to start getting to your calls right now.
[01:55:10.660 --> 01:55:12.660]  Jason and Indiana, you're on the air.
[01:55:12.660 --> 01:55:13.660]  Welcome.
[01:55:13.660 --> 01:55:14.660]  Hey, Alex.
[01:55:14.660 --> 01:55:16.660]  Hey, buddy.
[01:55:16.660 --> 01:55:24.660]  I think whatever religion or belief, we all need to pray every day for you and our country and the world.
[01:55:24.660 --> 01:55:26.660]  And even pray for our enemies.
[01:55:26.660 --> 01:55:32.660]  Because by praying for our enemies, we don't dump, it says in the Bible, like hot coals on our head.
[01:55:32.660 --> 01:55:35.660]  And I believe they believe in a spirit world.
[01:55:35.660 --> 01:55:38.660]  And I believe there's power and prayer.
[01:55:38.660 --> 01:55:42.660]  And I believe for every demon, there's two angels.
[01:55:42.660 --> 01:55:51.660]  And I also believe that we shouldn't fear them because it keeps us coming in a lower state.
[01:55:51.660 --> 01:55:53.660]  And I believe we're all energy.
[01:55:53.660 --> 01:56:05.660]  And I also believe that people should go to town meetings and fight for clean water and rights to be able to have a yard sale or build a shed or whatever.
[01:56:05.660 --> 01:56:14.660]  And I believe that we should contact store manufacturers and stuff and tell them to get good food on the shelves.
[01:56:14.660 --> 01:56:16.660]  Well, Jason, I appreciate your call.
[01:56:16.660 --> 01:56:20.660]  I want to get Joel's take on that, but you just raised a bunch of issues.
[01:56:20.660 --> 01:56:22.660]  They're trying to pass state laws.
[01:56:22.660 --> 01:56:27.660]  They have passed federal laws with multimillion dollar fines for garage sales.
[01:56:27.660 --> 01:56:28.660]  That's AP.
[01:56:28.660 --> 01:56:33.660]  They are swat teaming people selling vegetables on the side of the road.
[01:56:33.660 --> 01:56:43.660]  They are doing everything they can to train us to be slaves and to train the police that it's normal for them to treat us like slaves.
[01:56:43.660 --> 01:56:57.660]  And I do agree with you that just getting out and being heard and saying no to what's happening is a large part of defeating the system, Joel.
[01:56:57.660 --> 01:57:04.660]  Things about prayer, I think we do need the Lord's help.
[01:57:04.660 --> 01:57:09.660]  I am not one of those believers, however, that you can simply pray that the Lord will make evil, controlled people good.
[01:57:09.660 --> 01:57:15.660]  He will not interfere with their free agency to chew the aptose in the evil side.
[01:57:15.660 --> 01:57:23.660]  I pray most precipitously to try to get good people to wake up and to be able to see wolves and sheets closing.
[01:57:23.660 --> 01:57:27.660]  I don't think we can simply pray prayer. Then we have to pray in an inspired manner.
[01:57:27.660 --> 01:57:33.660]  We have to listen to the will of the Lord about what's appropriate to pray for and be guided by that.
[01:57:33.660 --> 01:57:37.660]  Joel, how do you deal with it psychologically or spiritually?
[01:57:37.660 --> 01:57:48.660]  Because one philosopher said when you stare into the abyss, be careful you don't become the abyss or someone else said, I forget who that when you dance with the devil, the devil doesn't change.
[01:57:48.660 --> 01:57:55.660]  He changes you. Just studying this every day and learning about the enemy and learning about their mind.
[01:57:55.660 --> 01:58:03.660]  I've gotten to the point, I've always been disgusted by it, but now it just gets worse and worse.
[01:58:03.660 --> 01:58:14.660]  As I learn how they operate and what they think and get inside their heads and can see what they're seeing, think what they're thinking, it really gets to me.
[01:58:14.660 --> 01:58:16.660]  How do you deal with that?
[01:58:16.660 --> 01:58:22.660]  Well, first of all, I think you have to realize that you can't let it get to you. You can't let it bother you.
[01:58:22.660 --> 01:58:28.660]  We have to do what we can do and I don't try, for example, to change people who I feel resistance from.
[01:58:28.660 --> 01:58:32.660]  I work with people who I sense that they feel that something's wrong.
[01:58:32.660 --> 01:58:35.660]  Stay there. Let's come back in one minute. Stay there. We've got to come back in 70 seconds.
[01:58:35.660 --> 01:58:39.660]  Finish up that point and we're going to continue with your phone calls. Stay with us.
[01:58:39.660 --> 01:58:48.660]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.

[02:00:05.660 --> 02:00:13.660]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.660 --> 02:00:22.660]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.660 --> 02:00:35.660]  Okay, got another hour with Joel Scalson and your phone calls. Have you just joined us? I had to ask Joel Scalson at World Affairs Brief researcher and analyst studying the globalist crime syndicate.
[02:00:35.660 --> 02:00:48.660]  How he deals with knowing all this information, because I try to not let it get to me, but it doesn't even weigh me down or wear me out.
[02:00:48.660 --> 02:00:56.660]  It more just disgusts me. It's kind of like I describe it as working, you know, around a bunch of rotten dead animals or something.
[02:00:56.660 --> 02:01:00.660]  It's just disgusting. I'm sick of it. And I'm sick of how outrageous it's gotten.
[02:01:00.660 --> 02:01:13.660]  And I know the globalists are trying to break our spirit, break our will, sell us on accepting anything and everything evil, making us capitulate, breaking our spirit, I guess is the word.
[02:01:13.660 --> 02:01:20.660]  But Joel, finish up your comment on that. You know, I fought this same battle for many, many years and I finally got a handle on it.
[02:01:20.660 --> 02:01:31.660]  I used to be very, very depressed because not only was I discovering more and more evil and more and more collusion between government and judges.
[02:01:31.660 --> 02:01:39.660]  Everybody, there's a great deal of involvement. But it's interesting that as I realized at some point, you know, I still have a life to live.
[02:01:39.660 --> 02:01:46.660]  I've still got a family to attend to. They're important things to do. You can't get borscht out of everything.
[02:01:46.660 --> 02:01:52.660]  So I've learned to compartmentalize it just like my father, who was the divorce attorney. He decided to leave it at the office.
[02:01:52.660 --> 02:02:00.660]  He did not bring it home. And you have to do that. But still, I don't walk around as a Pollyanna.
[02:02:00.660 --> 02:02:07.660]  I don't try to use positive thinking garbage to explain this stuff away. It's very real. It's very serious.
[02:02:07.660 --> 02:02:11.660]  But people need to realize because there's a lot of people on the fringe.
[02:02:11.660 --> 02:02:16.660]  I mean, my wife, for example, knows what I know, but she doesn't feel as passionate as I do about it.
[02:02:16.660 --> 02:02:27.660]  And I have to respect that. Most of your listeners are dealing with a spouse or friends or other people who just don't innately feel as passionate as you and I may feel about this.
[02:02:27.660 --> 02:02:34.660]  And we have to give them space. We have to not be too pushy on people and give them time to absorb this.
[02:02:34.660 --> 02:02:41.660]  And give them credible information. Wait till they sense that something's wrong. That, Alex, takes the frustration away.
[02:02:41.660 --> 02:02:48.660]  I've seen people literally destroy their marriages by going at this thing with a bludgeon, trying to hit people over the head and say,
[02:02:48.660 --> 02:02:54.660]  can't you see that this world is crumbling? I think we have to look at and take this as a test.
[02:02:54.660 --> 02:02:59.660]  We're all being tested at this world to see who's going to see, who's going to sense that something's wrong.
[02:02:59.660 --> 02:03:04.660]  And I try not to get in the way of people's blindness if they're willfully blind.
[02:03:04.660 --> 02:03:09.660]  I'm going after the people who sense that something's wrong that I can influence.
[02:03:09.660 --> 02:03:15.660]  Well, I agree with you on that issue. And plus, this is important, powerful info.
[02:03:15.660 --> 02:03:18.660]  If you try to push it on people, they automatically refuse.
[02:03:18.660 --> 02:03:22.660]  But if you just state, here's the facts. This is the way it is.
[02:03:22.660 --> 02:03:30.660]  And you know deep down that we're all in danger and society is unraveling by design
[02:03:30.660 --> 02:03:35.660]  so these globalists can build this nightmare system on its ashes.
[02:03:35.660 --> 02:03:42.660]  And 10 years ago, I would get 50-50 positive, 50% negative.
[02:03:42.660 --> 02:03:48.660]  Now, it's got to be 90% positive. I mean, people are really starting to wake up.
[02:03:48.660 --> 02:03:54.660]  That's why the system is injecting co-opted people, green horns.
[02:03:54.660 --> 02:03:59.660]  And that's how I see Glenn Beck is that one show I'll watch and it's all truth.
[02:03:59.660 --> 02:04:02.660]  The next show I watch, it's Neocon Lies.
[02:04:02.660 --> 02:04:06.660]  And he sells it like he really believes it a lot of the time.
[02:04:06.660 --> 02:04:12.660]  But I see people like Glenn Beck is basically a green horn that they're handling and using.
[02:04:12.660 --> 02:04:18.660]  Well, my view and I know quite a bit about Glenn and, in fact, his mentor
[02:04:18.660 --> 02:04:23.660]  and his conservative philosophy is my uncle, W. Clemskousen, who's a great mentor.
[02:04:23.660 --> 02:04:27.660]  But Glenn even saw things through rose-colored glasses.
[02:04:27.660 --> 02:04:33.660]  It took me two-solid until two years before he died, Alex, before I could convince him
[02:04:33.660 --> 02:04:37.660]  that, in fact, Bush was part of the problem and was not redeemable
[02:04:37.660 --> 02:04:39.660]  and that the Republicans were part of the problem.
[02:04:39.660 --> 02:04:42.660]  This is incredible. Stay there. You know, I'd forgotten that Glenn Beck says
[02:04:42.660 --> 02:04:49.660]  what woke him up was your uncle's book or books and seminal writing.
[02:04:49.660 --> 02:04:51.660]  So let's talk about that when we come back and then to the phone calls.
[02:04:51.660 --> 02:04:56.660]  I tell you, we should have been having Joel Scalson on years ago before all this.
[02:04:56.660 --> 02:05:20.660]  Uh, just time flies. Stay with us.
[02:05:26.660 --> 02:05:41.660]  Well, Marty, what do you have to say?
[02:05:41.660 --> 02:06:04.660]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:06:04.660 --> 02:06:08.660]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:06:08.660 --> 02:06:14.660]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:06:14.660 --> 02:06:19.660]  It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:06:19.660 --> 02:06:24.660]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:06:24.660 --> 02:06:28.660]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:06:28.660 --> 02:06:31.660]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:06:31.660 --> 02:06:35.660]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[02:06:35.660 --> 02:06:40.660]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:06:40.660 --> 02:06:45.660]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:06:45.660 --> 02:06:51.660]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:06:51.660 --> 02:06:59.660]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:06:59.660 --> 02:07:02.660]  Listen up, friends. This is Alex Jones with key information.
[02:07:02.660 --> 02:07:06.660]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.
[02:07:06.660 --> 02:07:09.660]  Don't be dependent on the government for you and your family.
[02:07:09.660 --> 02:07:14.660]  You need to get your own supply of high-quality, storeable foods from eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:07:14.660 --> 02:07:20.660]  They're the best company out there, the longest continually operating, with a ton of great food to choose from.

[02:07:22.660 --> 02:07:26.660]  Not some old, cruddy food they're selling you like some of the other guys.
[02:07:26.660 --> 02:07:30.660]  Try their new evacuation pack, a two-week supply of delicious, easy-to-fix food.
[02:07:30.660 --> 02:07:36.660]  It comes with all the equipment you need to prepare it with open talk of a strike on Iran the next three months.
[02:07:36.660 --> 02:07:39.660]  The crisis in the Gulf and possible evacuations.
[02:07:39.660 --> 02:07:41.660]  Get yourself and your family ready today.
[02:07:41.660 --> 02:07:43.660]  The place to go is eFoodsDirect.com.

[02:07:51.660 --> 02:08:00.660]  Again on the web, eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex or give them a call at 800-409-5633.
[02:08:22.660 --> 02:08:27.660]  Alright, let's go back to Joel Scalson.
[02:08:27.660 --> 02:08:34.660]  I hate to get back into Glenn back here on the show, but clearly you can see the media building him up for a fall,
[02:08:34.660 --> 02:08:39.660]  making Glenn and Sarah Palin the leaders of the Tea Party.
[02:08:39.660 --> 02:08:46.660]  And we know News Corp and Fox News is totally pro-New World Order.
[02:08:46.660 --> 02:08:51.660]  They've denied world government, made fun of it for decades.
[02:08:51.660 --> 02:08:53.660]  Now, everything we talked about has come true.
[02:08:53.660 --> 02:08:56.660]  Everything Cleon Scalson talked about has unfolded.
[02:08:56.660 --> 02:09:00.660]  Everything Joel Scalson for 30-something years has talked about has happened.
[02:09:00.660 --> 02:09:04.660]  Everything I've been talking about for 15 years is now out in the open.
[02:09:04.660 --> 02:09:13.660]  And Glenn Beck says, Cleon Scalson, you know, is his main political mentor, and I guess spiritual mentor.
[02:09:13.660 --> 02:09:19.660]  And, you know, we've got his nephew, author, and researcher on Joel Scalson right now.
[02:09:19.660 --> 02:09:26.660]  And meanwhile, he's saying, if you're a 9-11 truth or you're a scum of the earth, the army needs to be used against you.
[02:09:26.660 --> 02:09:30.660]  Ron Paul's money bomb might want to blow things up.
[02:09:30.660 --> 02:09:38.660]  And so I've really seen him, you know, go to the White House, get orders from Bush, come out and say there are no FEMA camps,
[02:09:38.660 --> 02:09:45.660]  no plans for camps, you know, I see him going, well, the Mayak reports out there, but it's not that bad.
[02:09:45.660 --> 02:09:48.660]  And then I hear him on another show tell the truth.
[02:09:48.660 --> 02:09:49.660]  Here's an example.
[02:09:49.660 --> 02:09:51.660]  Here's this new book, The Overton Window.
[02:09:51.660 --> 02:09:56.660]  There's a talk show host who gets the Mayak report from Homeland Security whistleblowers.
[02:09:56.660 --> 02:09:57.660]  That was Alex Jones on record.
[02:09:57.660 --> 02:09:58.660]  He knows that.
[02:09:58.660 --> 02:10:06.660]  And I, you know, this character, Mr. Bailey, about Alex Jones, you know, the same person, stops a nuke being detonated in LA.
[02:10:06.660 --> 02:10:09.660]  And the government is staging terror attacks.
[02:10:09.660 --> 02:10:14.660]  Then at the end of the book, Beck says, I don't believe government ever stages terror.
[02:10:14.660 --> 02:10:16.660]  This is fiction.
[02:10:16.660 --> 02:10:22.660]  But at the start of the book, he says it's faction that is fiction that talks about facts.
[02:10:22.660 --> 02:10:28.660]  So what double game is Glenn Beck pulling here?
[02:10:28.660 --> 02:10:32.660]  And you're saying, you know, quite a bit about him and a lot of inside baseball.
[02:10:32.660 --> 02:10:37.660]  And I know he has said that Cleon Scowles and your uncle, the author is the person that woke him up.
[02:10:37.660 --> 02:10:41.660]  And I know your uncle's books were excellent and worse seminal.
[02:10:41.660 --> 02:10:43.660]  You know, when did those books come out?
[02:10:43.660 --> 02:10:46.660]  How many decades ago, 30, 40, 50 years ago?
[02:10:46.660 --> 02:10:47.660]  That's right.
[02:10:47.660 --> 02:10:50.660]  The first naked communist and naked capitalist.
[02:10:50.660 --> 02:10:55.660]  And then, of course, he wrote the great, beautiful volume, the making of America, a real seminal work.
[02:10:55.660 --> 02:11:00.660]  His 5,000 year leap has gone to best teller status because of Glenn Beck recommending it.
[02:11:00.660 --> 02:11:05.660]  It's not quite as good, frankly, from my point of view as the making of America.
[02:11:05.660 --> 02:11:10.660]  But at least it's done its job in terms of getting people to be interested in the Constitution.
[02:11:10.660 --> 02:11:12.660]  And I think Glenn's done a great job about that.
[02:11:12.660 --> 02:11:14.660]  He certainly boosted the movement.
[02:11:14.660 --> 02:11:19.660]  But I think, Alex, what we're dealing with, with both Sarah Palin and Glenn Beck,
[02:11:19.660 --> 02:11:22.660]  we're dealing with people who are controllable.
[02:11:22.660 --> 02:11:25.660]  These are not evil people, per se.
[02:11:25.660 --> 02:11:27.660]  In fact, Glenn Beck is not.
[02:11:27.660 --> 02:11:31.660]  He's a very good person, but he's unstable and he's controllable.
[02:11:31.660 --> 02:11:35.660]  Sarah Palin is, to a certain extent, what I would call corruptible.
[02:11:35.660 --> 02:11:39.660]  She's been corrupted by the money that has been offered her, not only for the book deals,
[02:11:39.660 --> 02:11:45.660]  but for the air, for the private jet, for the handlers, all of this stuff that's being paid for.
[02:11:45.660 --> 02:11:52.660]  You know, she was just on her flat on her back financially as governor of Alaska
[02:11:52.660 --> 02:11:55.660]  until they offered her this deal that she couldn't refuse.
[02:11:55.660 --> 02:11:58.660]  Now, they've learned how to play Sarah Palin very, very smart.
[02:11:58.660 --> 02:12:03.660]  They have not told her, all right, we're in control, you're going to take orders from us.
[02:12:03.660 --> 02:12:09.660]  But they know how to play her, so to speak, so that they can convince her to do stupid things
[02:12:09.660 --> 02:12:14.660]  like endorse John McCain for Senate and other bad endorsements that she's made.
[02:12:14.660 --> 02:12:17.660]  Glenn Beck is a more complex character.
[02:12:17.660 --> 02:12:24.660]  He comes from an unstable background, alcoholism, drug abuse, some other things that I won't mention.
[02:12:24.660 --> 02:12:29.660]  He's come from a rock music background, makes him a little bit unstable.
[02:12:29.660 --> 02:12:31.660]  He shoots from the hip.
[02:12:31.660 --> 02:12:35.660]  This is a person who can be manipulated to a certain extent.
[02:12:35.660 --> 02:12:39.660]  Now, I don't believe he ever got any direct orders from Bush to deny FEMA camps.
[02:12:39.660 --> 02:12:46.660]  This was a very interesting case whereby he was actually condensed that, in fact, there were camps.
[02:12:46.660 --> 02:12:49.660]  And he even said so on the air on television.
[02:12:49.660 --> 02:12:52.660]  He said, tomorrow, and then he got turned around.
[02:12:52.660 --> 02:12:54.660]  Now, it wasn't the direct turnaround.
[02:12:54.660 --> 02:12:58.660]  You see, where somebody came and said to him, all right, you're going to do this and this and this.
[02:12:58.660 --> 02:13:01.660]  It was through the use of meags and the popular mechanics.
[02:13:01.660 --> 02:13:05.660]  These were his independent experts, they're anything but independent.
[02:13:05.660 --> 02:13:11.660]  They were recommended to him from his Fox sources, who is a controlled news organization, as you said.
[02:13:11.660 --> 02:13:16.660]  And it was through them explaining to them that, you know, you don't want to get on the air and explain this.
[02:13:16.660 --> 02:13:19.660]  This is going to embarrass you, and here's the real facts.
[02:13:19.660 --> 02:13:25.660]  And he did not have, and Glenn Becks continues to refuse to get alternative opinions.
[02:13:25.660 --> 02:13:28.660]  I mean, people have recommended that you need to talk to Joel Scowse.
[02:13:28.660 --> 02:13:33.660]  He's Clem's nephew, and he won't do it because I've criticized him, you know, before.
[02:13:33.660 --> 02:13:36.660]  He's got a very thin skin, and that's a problem.
[02:13:36.660 --> 02:13:39.660]  You know, when your ego gets too big and you won't take criticism,
[02:13:39.660 --> 02:13:43.660]  but I could help him out a lot if he would be willing to take that.
[02:13:43.660 --> 02:13:51.660]  But unfortunately, I think he's gone so far down the bridge down the river now in condemning conspiracy.
[02:13:51.660 --> 02:13:58.660]  I happen to know from private sources that he actually is beginning to believe that conspiracy really occurs.
[02:13:58.660 --> 02:14:00.660]  But he can't say so now.
[02:14:00.660 --> 02:14:03.660]  He knows that he'd lose his position on Fox News.
[02:14:03.660 --> 02:14:06.660]  And so he's in denial, and he talks himself out of it.
[02:14:06.660 --> 02:14:11.660]  You know, sincere people have this problem, Alex, is that they can't admit they were wrong many times.
[02:14:11.660 --> 02:14:18.660]  They actually have to screw up their mind and convince themselves that what they feel is not right.
[02:14:18.660 --> 02:14:20.660]  And that's what Glenn Becks is.
[02:14:20.660 --> 02:14:22.660]  Well, yeah, George Arwell called that crime stop.
[02:14:22.660 --> 02:14:28.660]  If you're having a thought, you know, Big Brother is saying that he's always been at war with East Asia.
[02:14:28.660 --> 02:14:33.660]  But just yesterday, the news said that Big Brother had never been at war with East Asia.
[02:14:33.660 --> 02:14:37.660]  It's crime stop that when you realize that this is propaganda,
[02:14:37.660 --> 02:14:41.660]  you convince yourself that no, that's just a conspiracy theory.
[02:14:41.660 --> 02:14:51.660]  But I mean, the reports are, you know, that his mother died mysteriously, probably suicide, all these other weird family problems.
[02:14:51.660 --> 02:14:57.660]  You know, then he allows himself to be videotaped saying he fake cries on TV.
[02:14:57.660 --> 02:15:06.660]  And I mean, I see him and nobody's perfect as somebody who they're really building up to be the leader
[02:15:06.660 --> 02:15:10.660]  of the patriot movement because it was already there because of myself, Ron Paul,
[02:15:10.660 --> 02:15:15.660]  you know, your uncle, yourself and thousands of other prominent, you know, real people.
[02:15:15.660 --> 02:15:20.660]  And that the system was losing credibility, just denying that any of this exists.
[02:15:20.660 --> 02:15:27.660]  So here comes Glenn Beck and he'll cover some of it, but then discredit what's real.
[02:15:27.660 --> 02:15:33.660]  I mean, FEMA camps under Top Off 1 and 2, under the Emergency Centers Act,
[02:15:33.660 --> 02:15:39.660]  under all the military urban warfare drills, under the civilian inmate labor camp program,
[02:15:39.660 --> 02:15:44.660]  and by the way, I sent this to him in the month that he was hyping that he thought it was real
[02:15:44.660 --> 02:15:47.660]  and that he was going to be covering.
[02:15:47.660 --> 02:15:52.660]  And I mailed it to Fox. We had our listeners email him, you know, the Army's own admissions
[02:15:52.660 --> 02:15:58.660]  that they can turn sports stadiums into camps in two hours, that they do drills for shutting down cities.
[02:15:58.660 --> 02:16:05.660]  I sent him their own admissions. I sent him the 12 civilian inmate labor camp program areas.
[02:16:05.660 --> 02:16:11.660]  I sent him Rex 84 documents, Miami Herald congressional hearings.
[02:16:11.660 --> 02:16:17.660]  And I then predicted that it was a sucker punch the week before.
[02:16:17.660 --> 02:16:24.660]  I said, I believe he's going to come out and point at two fake camps that I exposed more than a decade ago.
[02:16:24.660 --> 02:16:31.660]  And he did it. And I thought that I was like psychic and could just get in his brain later.
[02:16:31.660 --> 02:16:36.660]  I found out from high level Fox news people who are actually patriots. I'll just leave it at that.
[02:16:36.660 --> 02:16:40.660]  One's a household name and others an executive that Glenn Beck.
[02:16:40.660 --> 02:16:48.660]  Glenn Beck for years has at least one producer at sometimes five people listening to all my shows,
[02:16:48.660 --> 02:16:53.660]  all my films, and that Glenn Beck literally is obsessed with Alex Jones.
[02:16:53.660 --> 02:16:57.660]  And this is from high level people. And it's just, it's creepy Joel.
[02:16:57.660 --> 02:17:06.660]  And I now I realize his job is basically to take my message, make it palatable and neocon and sell it to people.
[02:17:06.660 --> 02:17:10.660]  And yes, he has two FBI retired agents that protect him.
[02:17:10.660 --> 02:17:14.660]  I've got that from another high level source. He's totally scared of the public.
[02:17:14.660 --> 02:17:19.660]  And he is starting to actually know this is all real, but you're right.
[02:17:19.660 --> 02:17:25.660]  He now he's gone too far. I mean, I guess he it's a very complex issue.
[02:17:25.660 --> 02:17:31.660]  It's just it's creepy to have him writing a book where I'm basically the hero under a pseudonym.
[02:17:31.660 --> 02:17:33.660]  But then at the end of the book, he says it isn't real.
[02:17:33.660 --> 02:17:37.660]  I mean, is that a cry for help him saying, look, you know, I know this is real.
[02:17:37.660 --> 02:17:39.660]  I'm not bad or what is it?
[02:17:39.660 --> 02:17:43.660]  Well, you know, I think we have to understand that Glenn's a weak person.
[02:17:43.660 --> 02:17:50.660]  He himself admits he's a weak person and the establishment really loves to use that. Sarah Palin is a weak person.
[02:17:50.660 --> 02:17:52.660]  She's dynamic and she's beautiful.
[02:17:52.660 --> 02:17:57.660]  And she has all of those things that make it a good manipulated ploy for people.
[02:17:57.660 --> 02:18:00.660]  But I'm convinced that they're maintaining Palin.
[02:18:00.660 --> 02:18:03.660]  They gave her her position on Fox News to increase her exposure.
[02:18:03.660 --> 02:18:07.660]  They could dump Glenn Beck any time they wanted to, if they would.
[02:18:07.660 --> 02:18:12.660]  But I think they like having a fallible foil out there in front of the people.
[02:18:12.660 --> 02:18:17.660]  Because at once, in terms of credible independence, Glenn Beck doesn't get a lot of traction
[02:18:17.660 --> 02:18:21.660]  because it is goofy nature and is sticking his tongue out and making pictures.
[02:18:21.660 --> 02:18:24.660]  You know, they don't put anybody well-spoken on Fox.
[02:18:24.660 --> 02:18:31.660]  When they want to talk about the birther issue and its birth certificate, the CIA background of Obama,
[02:18:31.660 --> 02:18:34.660]  they don't put someone credible who has facts.
[02:18:34.660 --> 02:18:38.660]  They put someone like the former military doctor in there, he didn't know what he was talking about,
[02:18:38.660 --> 02:18:45.660]  he didn't know the difference between a birth certificate and a certification of live birth from a live.
[02:18:45.660 --> 02:18:51.660]  That's what they're dealing with. They're putting up false heroes in front of us to divert public
[02:18:51.660 --> 02:18:54.660]  from those that would really do a good job.
[02:18:54.660 --> 02:18:58.660]  And I think that's what the Tea Party people have to realize is happening to them.
[02:18:58.660 --> 02:19:00.660]  Why do you think they're so concerned?
[02:19:00.660 --> 02:19:02.660]  And again, this isn't an ego trip, folks.
[02:19:02.660 --> 02:19:08.660]  I mean, the websites are bigger than Limbaugh and bigger than Sean Hannity and Glenn Beck's combined.
[02:19:08.660 --> 02:19:12.660]  Just one of my sites. We do reach millions of people every day now.
[02:19:12.660 --> 02:19:18.660]  But I tell you, that's creepy, and it makes me see how weak I am and how fallible I am
[02:19:18.660 --> 02:19:24.660]  and the responsibility I've got, Joel, because I never intended to be having this big of an effect.
[02:19:24.660 --> 02:19:32.660]  And few things shake me up, but it's a little creepy to know that Glenn Beck's got people listening to this show right now.
[02:19:32.660 --> 02:19:35.660]  Well, you know, at least...
[02:19:35.660 --> 02:19:40.660]  Well, there's a difference between people like Rush Limbaugh and O'Reilly and Hannity.
[02:19:40.660 --> 02:19:43.660]  These people are actually on the other side of my opinion.
[02:19:43.660 --> 02:19:45.660]  They're just playing the conservative.
[02:19:45.660 --> 02:19:50.660]  Glenn Beck is sincerely on our side, but he's manipulated. That's my basic treatment.
[02:19:50.660 --> 02:19:53.660]  I tend to agree with you more and more. I've really been studying Beck.
[02:19:53.660 --> 02:19:57.660]  Let's come back into those calls, we promised we would, and a bunch of other issues.
[02:19:57.660 --> 02:20:26.660]  This website's worldaffairsbrief.com.
[02:20:27.660 --> 02:20:55.660]  This website's worldaffairsbrief.com.
[02:20:55.660 --> 02:21:05.660]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[02:21:05.660 --> 02:21:10.660]  Tyranny is here. The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:21:10.660 --> 02:21:12.660]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:21:12.660 --> 02:21:18.660]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:21:18.660 --> 02:21:25.660]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:21:25.660 --> 02:21:31.660]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:21:31.660 --> 02:21:35.660]  At least state 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[02:21:35.660 --> 02:21:39.660]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:21:39.660 --> 02:21:45.660]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:21:45.660 --> 02:21:49.660]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:21:49.660 --> 02:21:52.660]  The police state isn't coming. It's here.

[02:22:00.660 --> 02:22:06.660]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the US dollar has been devaluating.
[02:22:06.660 --> 02:22:10.660]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[02:22:10.660 --> 02:22:13.660]  Is there a way to prevent your portfolios from losing value?
[02:22:13.660 --> 02:22:15.660]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[02:22:15.660 --> 02:22:18.660]  They have both maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[02:22:18.660 --> 02:22:26.660]  If you had had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them both until now,
[02:22:26.660 --> 02:22:30.660]  your cash would actually have the buying power of only $4,800.
[02:22:30.660 --> 02:22:34.660]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3 million.
[02:22:34.660 --> 02:22:36.660]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.

[02:24:14.660 --> 02:24:17.660]  Okay, I said I'd get to your calls as we're all over the map here,
[02:24:17.660 --> 02:24:21.660]  but it's always an informative and enlightening conversation with Joel Scalston.
[02:24:21.660 --> 02:24:23.660]  Let's at least get to these five callers.
[02:24:23.660 --> 02:24:26.660]  Michael in Texas, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:24:26.660 --> 02:24:29.660]  Hey folks, thanks for taking the call.
[02:24:29.660 --> 02:24:32.660]  Alex, first of all, I just want to let you know, I feel your pain.
[02:24:32.660 --> 02:24:37.660]  Sometimes when I'm listening to the program and I hear, I almost have tears in my eyes,
[02:24:37.660 --> 02:24:45.660]  because this is a natural human emotion to be angry and to want to warn your fellow man.
[02:24:45.660 --> 02:24:49.660]  You have outgoing love and concern for people.
[02:24:49.660 --> 02:24:54.660]  So don't you ever feel bad that you're getting angry or animated about this?
[02:24:54.660 --> 02:25:02.660]  It's the dumbed-down, drugged-up, fluoridated society that has just turned into zombies
[02:25:02.660 --> 02:25:05.660]  that is the antithesis of what we should be.
[02:25:05.660 --> 02:25:10.660]  Well, Michael, it's just that when I talk about being upset about this stuff,
[02:25:10.660 --> 02:25:16.660]  it's just getting worse, because everything we talked about is true and worse.
[02:25:16.660 --> 02:25:20.660]  Because I've studied history, I've studied these scientific dictators.
[02:25:20.660 --> 02:25:25.660]  I know their program, but to really see it now moving so quickly,
[02:25:25.660 --> 02:25:31.660]  and I guess it's that I have children, eight years old, six and two,
[02:25:31.660 --> 02:25:36.660]  and every time I look at them, I think about how dangerous this world is,
[02:25:36.660 --> 02:25:42.660]  and I just wish other people would realize how dangerous this is.
[02:25:42.660 --> 02:25:46.660]  Carlson, can you comment to that for new listeners out there who tune in
[02:25:46.660 --> 02:25:51.660]  and may be wondering if this world government is real or if it is real?
[02:25:51.660 --> 02:25:53.660]  Maybe it's a good thing.
[02:25:53.660 --> 02:25:58.660]  Well, intrinsically, there's nothing wrong with government at any level
[02:25:58.660 --> 02:26:03.660]  that defends fundamental rights in a proper way and is limited by constitutional government.
[02:26:03.660 --> 02:26:08.660]  You could do that at a federal level, at a state level, or even at a world level.
[02:26:08.660 --> 02:26:12.660]  But that isn't where they're headed. There is a conspiracy for world government.
[02:26:12.660 --> 02:26:15.660]  I can assure people I've got the evidence to back that up,
[02:26:15.660 --> 02:26:20.660]  and there is a major movement to project that.
[02:26:20.660 --> 02:26:28.660]  And frankly, they're making progress, but we are winning right now the information war
[02:26:28.660 --> 02:26:32.660]  in good portion because of your work, Alex.
[02:26:32.660 --> 02:26:38.660]  I mean, over 35% of Americans doubt whether the President of the United States is an actual,
[02:26:38.660 --> 02:26:40.660]  is eligible to run for office.
[02:26:40.660 --> 02:26:42.660]  30 some percent.
[02:26:42.660 --> 02:26:44.660]  But we know he's not. I mean, forget the...
[02:26:44.660 --> 02:26:49.660]  Well, our staff don't believe the government story on 9-11.
[02:26:49.660 --> 02:26:53.660]  And yet, so the establishment's very, very worried about where we're going.
[02:26:53.660 --> 02:26:56.660]  Now, that's why I believe, Alex, that they're going to pull a war on us
[02:26:56.660 --> 02:27:00.660]  to bring people into line, to make people forget about their doubts.
[02:27:00.660 --> 02:27:05.660]  War someday is going to be the big stick that's going to knock people over the head
[02:27:05.660 --> 02:27:06.660]  and bring them into line.
[02:27:06.660 --> 02:27:09.660]  I agree with you, but I want to get a final comment from Michael,
[02:27:09.660 --> 02:27:16.660]  but finishing up on that topic, there's no doubt he gave up his citizenship
[02:27:16.660 --> 02:27:20.660]  to become an Indonesian citizen and took the name Barry Sataro.
[02:27:20.660 --> 02:27:25.660]  And now, Wayne Madsen, you were on with him right after him last week,
[02:27:25.660 --> 02:27:30.660]  and Wayne Madsen got the other school certificate with another name.
[02:27:30.660 --> 02:27:38.660]  I mean, this guy's got more names than a South American drug lord.
[02:27:38.660 --> 02:27:43.660]  I mean, he's bottom line. Who is Barack Obama from your research?
[02:27:43.660 --> 02:27:49.660]  Well, Barack Obama, in my opinion, was someone who was born and raised in a leftist environment.
[02:27:49.660 --> 02:27:53.660]  And at some point, he got brought into the New World Order.
[02:27:53.660 --> 02:27:59.660]  And I think it was through a CIA offer when he was at Occidental College.
[02:27:59.660 --> 02:28:01.660]  And then he went on, Columbia was a ruse.
[02:28:01.660 --> 02:28:07.660]  I think he was working under cover for the CIA and occasionally attending from there on.
[02:28:07.660 --> 02:28:12.660]  But at some point, you take a leftist and he still acted a part of a leftist,
[02:28:12.660 --> 02:28:16.660]  but he'd been bought and sold, and the proof of that, of course, when they make him wealthy.
[02:28:16.660 --> 02:28:22.660]  I mean, how does the fourth rate attorney, who, by the way, lost his license in 2008,
[02:28:22.660 --> 02:28:28.660]  gave up his license because to avoid charges that he had lied on his bar association application.
[02:28:28.660 --> 02:28:33.660]  I mean, this guy's a fraud from the very beginning, but the real sign is when they make him wealthy,
[02:28:33.660 --> 02:28:40.660]  you know the fourth rate lawyer working for community services isn't going to make enough to buy a $9 million property
[02:28:40.660 --> 02:28:45.660]  in Hawaii or a $1.5 billion house in Chicago.
[02:28:45.660 --> 02:28:51.660]  This guy's been co-opted, and I think he's a controlled entity.
[02:28:51.660 --> 02:28:55.660]  There's no doubt about that. Anything else, Michael, in Texas?
[02:28:55.660 --> 02:28:58.660]  Oh, yeah. My son is 10 years old now.
[02:28:58.660 --> 02:29:03.660]  I was woken up because I saw him damaged by these MMR vaccines.
[02:29:03.660 --> 02:29:06.660]  And one of these autistic, I mean, he's a wonderful little guy,
[02:29:06.660 --> 02:29:09.660]  but I have the same feelings you have, Alex.
[02:29:09.660 --> 02:29:12.660]  You look at your children every day and just say, what if, what if.
[02:29:12.660 --> 02:29:18.660]  But the question I would have, and I'll hang up if you can comment on it, is how do we get through to people
[02:29:18.660 --> 02:29:22.660]  that appear to be waking up?
[02:29:22.660 --> 02:29:25.660]  In other words, people in America are very superficial.
[02:29:25.660 --> 02:29:28.660]  They don't dig in, and there's a lot of truth mixed with error.
[02:29:28.660 --> 02:29:32.660]  Let's say Glenn Beck, for example, talks about the Constitution.
[02:29:32.660 --> 02:29:35.660]  Right there, people who believe in the Constitution automatically think,
[02:29:35.660 --> 02:29:39.660]  we'll see outside with him because he talks about the Constitution.
[02:29:39.660 --> 02:29:44.660]  How do we get through to people and show them that there's really no difference between
[02:29:44.660 --> 02:29:48.660]  who's behind the scenes in the Democratic and Republican...
[02:29:48.660 --> 02:29:50.660]  Stay there. Let's get Joel Scouse's take.
[02:29:50.660 --> 02:29:54.660]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.660 --> 02:30:00.660]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.660 --> 02:30:04.660]  You may be arrested, and your subjects to other police action.
[02:30:04.660 --> 02:30:09.660]  Tarani is here. The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:30:09.660 --> 02:30:12.660]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:30:12.660 --> 02:30:17.660]  The United States has now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:30:17.660 --> 02:30:22.660]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps,
[02:30:22.660 --> 02:30:24.660]  now being expanded nationwide.
[02:30:24.660 --> 02:30:30.660]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old powerful shadow state.
[02:30:30.660 --> 02:30:34.660]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[02:30:34.660 --> 02:30:38.660]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:30:38.660 --> 02:30:44.660]  Body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:30:44.660 --> 02:30:48.660]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:30:48.660 --> 02:30:51.660]  The police state isn't coming. It's here.

[02:31:00.660 --> 02:31:05.660]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system
[02:31:05.660 --> 02:31:08.660]  with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions,
[02:31:08.660 --> 02:31:11.660]  yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs system
[02:31:11.660 --> 02:31:16.660]  and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[02:31:16.660 --> 02:31:21.660]  My name is Mario Safaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:31:21.660 --> 02:31:25.660]  Not only does the Silver Lungs system produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions,
[02:31:25.660 --> 02:31:29.660]  it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed
[02:31:29.660 --> 02:31:33.660]  to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[02:31:33.660 --> 02:31:41.660]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin and orally for the digestive system.

[02:33:10.660 --> 02:33:14.660]  Well, Joel Scalzen is our guest worldaffairsbrief.com
[02:33:14.660 --> 02:33:17.660]  and valuable information to other and subscribe to it.
[02:33:17.660 --> 02:33:24.660]  And I tell you, I really do agree with his analysis and his breakdown on so many subjects,
[02:33:24.660 --> 02:33:25.660]  especially on the Glenn Beck thing.
[02:33:25.660 --> 02:33:31.660]  The way Glenn Beck is so erratic and is always changing his views.
[02:33:31.660 --> 02:33:35.660]  But I do see him drifting towards more and more truth.
[02:33:35.660 --> 02:33:39.660]  I want to answer that caller's question about how do you reach out to people
[02:33:39.660 --> 02:33:45.660]  to know the difference between a Sarah Palin kind of Republicanoid awakening,
[02:33:45.660 --> 02:33:49.660]  just like Keith Oberman was exposing tyranny when Bush was in,
[02:33:49.660 --> 02:33:52.660]  but as soon as Obama's in, he's now supporting it.
[02:33:52.660 --> 02:33:57.660]  How do we stop this two-party tag teaming?
[02:33:57.660 --> 02:34:02.660]  But first, going into a break, you said you think Limbaugh and Hannity,
[02:34:02.660 --> 02:34:04.660]  that they're actually dark side.
[02:34:04.660 --> 02:34:06.660]  Give us your view on that.
[02:34:06.660 --> 02:34:11.660]  Well, the way that I make that decision, I look at how they handle the conspiracy issue.
[02:34:11.660 --> 02:34:14.660]  It's one thing to doubt conspiracy.
[02:34:14.660 --> 02:34:18.660]  I mean, we don't know, none of us know everything that's going on behind the scenes
[02:34:18.660 --> 02:34:20.660]  in the dark side of government.
[02:34:20.660 --> 02:34:25.660]  So there's a big black hole of information because the government is keeping it secret.
[02:34:25.660 --> 02:34:28.660]  So it's one thing to say, you know, I really have doubts about this and this,
[02:34:28.660 --> 02:34:30.660]  and I have doubts about that.
[02:34:30.660 --> 02:34:33.660]  But that's not what Hannity and O'Reilly or Limbaugh do not.
[02:34:33.660 --> 02:34:38.660]  Now, Limbaugh used to, before he made his first big $3 million contract in his radio career,
[02:34:38.660 --> 02:34:41.660]  he used to be pro-conspiracy, used to talk about it openly.
[02:34:41.660 --> 02:34:45.660]  He made that contract, and the next day, he wasn't just saying,
[02:34:45.660 --> 02:34:47.660]  you know, I'm not sure about conspiracy anymore.
[02:34:47.660 --> 02:34:52.660]  You could tell he hated it, and he was going to denigrate and excoriate any person
[02:34:52.660 --> 02:34:55.660]  who brought that subject up, and he proceeded to do so.
[02:34:55.660 --> 02:34:58.660]  The same thing happens with Hannity and O'Reilly.
[02:34:58.660 --> 02:35:01.660]  Yeah, they've got that constant smirk on their face that, to me,
[02:35:01.660 --> 02:35:05.660]  is an indication that there's not a legitimate sincerity.
[02:35:05.660 --> 02:35:10.660]  But that smirk really turns to total disgust, total denigration
[02:35:10.660 --> 02:35:13.660]  when they start to talk to anybody who's got conspiracy.
[02:35:13.660 --> 02:35:16.660]  They're not satisfied to merely say, hey, you brought up some good points.
[02:35:16.660 --> 02:35:18.660]  They won't even let them finish a sentence.
[02:35:18.660 --> 02:35:21.660]  And that means that they've bought into the concept,
[02:35:21.660 --> 02:35:24.660]  which I believe is part of the media conspiracy,
[02:35:24.660 --> 02:35:27.660]  that we must denigrate this issue of conspiracy,
[02:35:27.660 --> 02:35:30.660]  so that no one dares bring that up.
[02:35:30.660 --> 02:35:36.660]  So that none dare call a conspiracy, so that once the global system emerges
[02:35:36.660 --> 02:35:40.660]  after they've built it, you know, just like a giant ship built in a hangar,
[02:35:40.660 --> 02:35:43.660]  it opens up and outslides the ship into the harbor.
[02:35:43.660 --> 02:35:45.660]  They've now launched the world government.
[02:35:45.660 --> 02:35:49.660]  They're now in the BBC, Times of London, AP, Time Magazine,
[02:35:49.660 --> 02:35:53.660]  saying world government's the answer to all your problems,
[02:35:53.660 --> 02:35:56.660]  and it's exactly what Cleon Scalson said 50 years ago.
[02:35:56.660 --> 02:35:58.660]  It's what you said 30 years ago.
[02:35:58.660 --> 02:36:00.660]  It's what I said 15 years ago.
[02:36:00.660 --> 02:36:02.660]  It's what Ron Paul said 30 years ago.
[02:36:02.660 --> 02:36:06.660]  It's a private global banking cartel through fractional reserve banking
[02:36:06.660 --> 02:36:08.660]  dominating the globe.
[02:36:08.660 --> 02:36:12.660]  And we said that carbon tax was a fraud to fund the world government.
[02:36:12.660 --> 02:36:15.660]  They now admit it's to fund the world government.
[02:36:15.660 --> 02:36:21.660]  So what are Limbaugh and Hannity going to do whenever Hannity has Dick Morris on,
[02:36:21.660 --> 02:36:26.660]  and Dick Morris says they were conspiracy theories about the one world currency
[02:36:26.660 --> 02:36:29.660]  and the new world order and the plan to destroy America,
[02:36:29.660 --> 02:36:35.660]  but now they're not and Hannity in that video clip look completely freaked out
[02:36:35.660 --> 02:36:41.660]  and every time he has guest on now, they're now agreeing with us
[02:36:41.660 --> 02:36:45.660]  back is talking about world government and things at least partially.
[02:36:45.660 --> 02:36:52.660]  So it looks like a catch 22 of the establishment continues to just brazenly deny all this
[02:36:52.660 --> 02:36:54.660]  after it's out in the open.
[02:36:54.660 --> 02:36:57.660]  It's gone to completely politically discredit them.
[02:36:57.660 --> 02:37:01.660]  So I think they're putting their toe in the water with Glenn Beck.
[02:37:01.660 --> 02:37:05.660]  And I think with somebody who's real like Andrew Napolitano from my research,
[02:37:05.660 --> 02:37:10.660]  they're starting to put their whole foot in and it's almost like they're starting
[02:37:10.660 --> 02:37:13.660]  to hedge their bets thinking they may lose.
[02:37:13.660 --> 02:37:14.660]  Go ahead.
[02:37:14.660 --> 02:37:18.660]  Well, I think they have the war card they're going to play in order.
[02:37:18.660 --> 02:37:22.660]  So they may give a little bit on the conspiracy admit a little bit,
[02:37:22.660 --> 02:37:28.660]  but they will never go all the way and admit that this is really real and really a threat.
[02:37:28.660 --> 02:37:32.660]  I'll tell you why conspiracy is so important for the media to denigrate.
[02:37:32.660 --> 02:37:39.660]  This is going to be the primal issue that they're going to use to institute wholesale roundup
[02:37:39.660 --> 02:37:41.660]  of dissidents someday.
[02:37:41.660 --> 02:37:45.660]  When this war occurs, when there's a preemptive nuclear strike on America by Russian China,
[02:37:45.660 --> 02:37:47.660]  our leaders are going to come out of their bunkers.
[02:37:47.660 --> 02:37:53.660]  And believe me, they built brand new, very deep underground bunkers in the Washington, D.C. area.
[02:37:53.660 --> 02:37:56.660]  So that they hit the green bar and hit other places, they still have their bunkers,
[02:37:56.660 --> 02:38:00.660]  but they'll come out of their bunkers which are not being built for terrorist attack.
[02:38:00.660 --> 02:38:02.660]  The Russians deceived us.
[02:38:02.660 --> 02:38:04.660]  We didn't realize this was going to happen.
[02:38:04.660 --> 02:38:05.660]  We're innocent.
[02:38:05.660 --> 02:38:07.660]  Just like 9-11, we were ignorant.
[02:38:07.660 --> 02:38:11.660]  Don't fire us. We're the only ones capable of running this new government.
[02:38:11.660 --> 02:38:17.660]  But they will convince America in the panic of having major destruction in this country
[02:38:17.660 --> 02:38:23.660]  that they must give rebuilding power to a militarized world government.
[02:38:23.660 --> 02:38:28.660]  And when that war is prosecuted, all with the patriotism and knee-jerk reaction,
[02:38:28.660 --> 02:38:33.660]  getting behind government just like in World War II, even though our own government was instigated,
[02:38:33.660 --> 02:38:35.660]  starting a lot of this,
[02:38:35.660 --> 02:38:38.660]  they're going to have to deal with dissident.
[02:38:38.660 --> 02:38:41.660]  They're going to have to deal with the Joel Scowls and the Alex Joneses
[02:38:41.660 --> 02:38:46.660]  who say our government knew in advance this was a conspiracy to bring war upon us
[02:38:46.660 --> 02:38:48.660]  to force us into a new world order.
[02:38:48.660 --> 02:38:50.660]  And they will say, mark my words,
[02:38:50.660 --> 02:38:55.660]  those people who believe that our government conspired to do this are traitors.
[02:38:55.660 --> 02:38:57.660]  They're being unfaithful to our troops.
[02:38:57.660 --> 02:38:59.660]  They're not supporting our troops.
[02:38:59.660 --> 02:39:01.660]  We need to lock them up.
[02:39:01.660 --> 02:39:06.660]  The issue of conspiracy must always be made and evil in this society
[02:39:06.660 --> 02:39:09.660]  to justify locking people up.
[02:39:09.660 --> 02:39:14.660]  But if it's a Muslim conspiracy, that can exist because they control those decoys.
[02:39:14.660 --> 02:39:18.660]  It's that government and big corporations can't stage events,
[02:39:18.660 --> 02:39:22.660]  and that's why they hate 9-11 Truth so much in all its variants,
[02:39:22.660 --> 02:39:27.660]  because it introduces the idea that Gulf of Tonkin was staged, which is admitted,
[02:39:27.660 --> 02:39:30.660]  and Operation Ajax was staged.
[02:39:30.660 --> 02:39:37.660]  Once people start seeing things for what they really are and who stands to gain,
[02:39:37.660 --> 02:39:41.660]  that could potentially, if 9-11 Truth became completely mainstream,
[02:39:41.660 --> 02:39:46.660]  take away this globalist nuclear sneak attack.
[02:39:46.660 --> 02:39:51.660]  And the reason I agree with you, Joel, studying the entire geopolitical constellation
[02:39:51.660 --> 02:39:55.660]  is when you read the State Department memorandums,
[02:39:55.660 --> 02:39:57.660]  when you read the Pentagon training,
[02:39:57.660 --> 02:40:01.660]  when you read NLEO 9, when I've talked to colonels and generals
[02:40:01.660 --> 02:40:05.660]  who are now retired and JAG officers here on the air,
[02:40:05.660 --> 02:40:11.660]  they on record, this is public, and they have video games, countless games out
[02:40:11.660 --> 02:40:15.660]  with the same script, the same plot,
[02:40:15.660 --> 02:40:21.660]  that America is going to be nuked by domestic terrorists working with the Russians or Chinese.
[02:40:21.660 --> 02:40:25.660]  So they'll nuke us, blame it on the Russians, or let the Russians do it,
[02:40:25.660 --> 02:40:29.660]  and then blame it on Joel Scalson, or Alex Jones.
[02:40:29.660 --> 02:40:34.660]  And in these video games, they torture the patriots, it's wonderful, it's so much fun.
[02:40:34.660 --> 02:40:40.660]  But to make a long story short, they are getting the military ready
[02:40:40.660 --> 02:40:43.660]  for the United States to be devastated,
[02:40:43.660 --> 02:40:48.660]  and for I-4 NATO UN troops to occupy us,
[02:40:48.660 --> 02:40:51.660]  and you see Henry Kissinger and others saying,
[02:40:51.660 --> 02:40:55.660]  all we need is the right major crisis, and the people of the United States
[02:40:55.660 --> 02:41:00.660]  will accept the New World Order, they will accept United Nations troops on the streets of America.
[02:41:00.660 --> 02:41:06.660]  And so because I realize they need a bold, devastating stroke
[02:41:06.660 --> 02:41:10.660]  to really re-engineer the United States into the ultimate army
[02:41:10.660 --> 02:41:13.660]  and to roll out their secret weapons and take over the planet
[02:41:13.660 --> 02:41:17.660]  with the Anglo-American establishment duking it out with the Chinese and Russians,
[02:41:17.660 --> 02:41:22.660]  that that is exactly the type of thing they will do, is nuke major cities
[02:41:22.660 --> 02:41:25.660]  and use it to totally take over.
[02:41:25.660 --> 02:41:31.660]  And absolutely, that's when they're going to send teams to arrest tens of thousands of Americans
[02:41:31.660 --> 02:41:33.660]  who they know are patriots.
[02:41:33.660 --> 02:41:37.660]  And that's when we're going to have to defend ourselves if it comes to that.
[02:41:37.660 --> 02:41:42.660]  Well, and unfortunately, they're not going to allow people to prepare for that.
[02:41:42.660 --> 02:41:45.660]  That's why I have not believed that there'll ever be any domestic cares
[02:41:45.660 --> 02:41:47.660]  of using nuclear weapons.
[02:41:47.660 --> 02:41:50.660]  In fact, it's a lot of disinformation about loose nukes going around.
[02:41:50.660 --> 02:41:54.660]  In fact, the suitcase nukes are the most guarded prized possessions,
[02:41:54.660 --> 02:41:58.660]  the jewels of weaponry within the Soviet Union, the continuing Soviets,
[02:41:58.660 --> 02:42:00.660]  and the United States government.
[02:42:00.660 --> 02:42:02.660]  They have not been led with this.
[02:42:02.660 --> 02:42:05.660]  That was simply an excuse to be able to allow the government to romp around
[02:42:05.660 --> 02:42:09.660]  and, you know, and foment the terrorist threat image.
[02:42:09.660 --> 02:42:13.660]  But if they were to allow a loose nuke to go off of small one, for example,
[02:42:13.660 --> 02:42:15.660]  what would the American people want to do?
[02:42:15.660 --> 02:42:17.660]  They want to prepare against nuclear radiation,
[02:42:17.660 --> 02:42:20.660]  and our government does not want people prepared for this.
[02:42:20.660 --> 02:42:24.660]  They want us held hostage to this great preemptive nuclear strike
[02:42:24.660 --> 02:42:27.660]  that they're planning on unleashing upon us,
[02:42:27.660 --> 02:42:29.660]  so that there's a maximum panic.
[02:42:29.660 --> 02:42:32.660]  That's why I want to explain to the last show, you know,
[02:42:32.660 --> 02:42:35.660]  when I was hired by an architectural firm,
[02:42:35.660 --> 02:42:40.660]  high security firm to design nuclear prefab abolish all just for Pakistan,
[02:42:40.660 --> 02:42:42.660]  the government in Pakistan nixed it.
[02:42:42.660 --> 02:42:48.660]  They said, we do not want anybody marketing private fallout shelters in Pakistan.
[02:42:48.660 --> 02:42:50.660]  The same policy as the U.S. government.
[02:42:50.660 --> 02:42:53.660]  We do not want anybody prepared for nuclear war.
[02:42:53.660 --> 02:42:56.660]  Why? Because they know it's coming.
[02:42:56.660 --> 02:42:58.660]  They're preparing.
[02:42:58.660 --> 02:43:00.660]  You know, why not the American people?
[02:43:00.660 --> 02:43:04.660]  Well, we know that there were cases in the 60s, 70s, and 80s
[02:43:04.660 --> 02:43:07.660]  where the establishment wanted to have a nuclear war,
[02:43:07.660 --> 02:43:11.660]  and they talked about how they could get even greater control over society.
[02:43:11.660 --> 02:43:15.660]  I mean, that's the only way they're really going to end our free society
[02:43:15.660 --> 02:43:20.660]  and really try to get our guns is by a catastrophic psychological wound
[02:43:20.660 --> 02:43:23.660]  so that we will accept this new tyranny.
[02:43:23.660 --> 02:43:27.660]  And Joel, do you believe that 9-11 was a beta test
[02:43:27.660 --> 02:43:32.660]  for a massive controlled nuclear strike?
[02:43:32.660 --> 02:43:34.660]  Well, I don't think it was a beta test.
[02:43:34.660 --> 02:43:37.660]  I think it was a prelude to preparing the nation for it,
[02:43:37.660 --> 02:43:40.660]  or to see how much they could be manipulated with the terror strike.
[02:43:40.660 --> 02:43:46.660]  I mean, if they could pull off 9-11 and subvert all of the truth that came out
[02:43:46.660 --> 02:43:49.660]  about government involvement and explosives involved in the world,
[02:43:49.660 --> 02:43:51.660]  if they could subvert that,
[02:43:51.660 --> 02:43:54.660]  they knew that they could pull off a major preemptive nuclear strike
[02:43:54.660 --> 02:43:58.660]  and subvert the information that I have and put out on my website
[02:43:58.660 --> 02:44:00.660]  on how they had been covering for the Russians,
[02:44:00.660 --> 02:44:03.660]  how they had been continuing to allow Russia to build up
[02:44:03.660 --> 02:44:06.660]  and transfer technology to Russia and China,
[02:44:06.660 --> 02:44:08.660]  knowing that they're going to someday attack.
[02:44:08.660 --> 02:44:11.660]  I mean, they have to be able to cover up this information.
[02:44:11.660 --> 02:44:12.660]  They did it in World War II.
[02:44:12.660 --> 02:44:15.660]  They built up Hitler's forces in Krupp and Tyson
[02:44:15.660 --> 02:44:17.660]  and in the other German military firms.
[02:44:17.660 --> 02:44:19.660]  Yeah, that's the MO.
[02:44:19.660 --> 02:44:21.660]  And they successfully covered that up.
[02:44:21.660 --> 02:44:23.660]  So they're practicing, shall we say,
[02:44:23.660 --> 02:44:25.660]  on how good can we cover things up?
[02:44:25.660 --> 02:44:28.660]  How can we use the controlled media to do that?
[02:44:28.660 --> 02:44:30.660]  And they've got a real problem with the Internet,
[02:44:30.660 --> 02:44:32.660]  with the alternative media.
[02:44:32.660 --> 02:44:33.660]  We're getting stronger.
[02:44:33.660 --> 02:44:35.660]  We're getting a lot more adherence.
[02:44:35.660 --> 02:44:39.660]  Haven't you written a paper, in fact, I remember reading it years ago,
[02:44:39.660 --> 02:44:42.660]  about safe places in the United States?
[02:44:42.660 --> 02:44:43.660]  That's right.
[02:44:43.660 --> 02:44:46.660]  In fact, I have a new third edition coming out
[02:44:46.660 --> 02:44:48.660]  in a couple of months of what is called
[02:44:48.660 --> 02:44:51.660]  Strategic Relocation North American Guide to Safe Places.
[02:44:51.660 --> 02:44:54.660]  Where do you think the safest place in North America is?
[02:44:54.660 --> 02:44:56.660]  I mean, I know being in Central Texas,
[02:44:56.660 --> 02:45:00.660]  we're a major target of nukes,
[02:45:00.660 --> 02:45:02.660]  but if the globalists are launching the attack,
[02:45:02.660 --> 02:45:04.660]  will they want to destroy our own military,
[02:45:04.660 --> 02:45:07.660]  or will it just be the major cities to reduce population?
[02:45:07.660 --> 02:45:09.660]  No, they'll actually go after the military,
[02:45:09.660 --> 02:45:10.660]  almost exclusively.
[02:45:10.660 --> 02:45:13.660]  That's why I predict there's only about 15 major cities
[02:45:13.660 --> 02:45:14.660]  that will be destroyed.
[02:45:14.660 --> 02:45:17.660]  They don't want to destroy all the population.
[02:45:17.660 --> 02:45:21.660]  They want to harness that abject panic
[02:45:21.660 --> 02:45:23.660]  in favor of the new world order and rebuilding
[02:45:23.660 --> 02:45:24.660]  and going after this,
[02:45:24.660 --> 02:45:27.660]  and prosecuting this patriotic war afterwards.
[02:45:27.660 --> 02:45:29.660]  So they want to kill the old military,
[02:45:29.660 --> 02:45:30.660]  bring in the foreign troops,
[02:45:30.660 --> 02:45:34.660]  hype up the new conscripts to go under UN globalist control.
[02:45:34.660 --> 02:45:37.660]  So obviously you're saying Fort Hood's a prime target
[02:45:37.660 --> 02:45:40.660]  for the globalist controlled strike.
[02:45:40.660 --> 02:45:41.660]  Yeah, it certainly is.
[02:45:41.660 --> 02:45:44.660]  Every major military base is going to be a target,
[02:45:44.660 --> 02:45:47.660]  as well as many of the underground bases that they know about.
[02:45:47.660 --> 02:45:51.660]  And there's going to be some devastation,
[02:45:51.660 --> 02:45:52.660]  but people can survive it.
[02:45:52.660 --> 02:45:53.660]  It's very, very survivable.
[02:45:53.660 --> 02:45:56.660]  The Russians intend to survive this and continue to work.
[02:45:56.660 --> 02:45:59.660]  And so people ought not to believe the propaganda
[02:45:59.660 --> 02:46:01.660]  about absolute, I mean,
[02:46:01.660 --> 02:46:04.660]  there's going to be a tremendous devastation,
[02:46:04.660 --> 02:46:06.660]  nothing else from the EMP strike.
[02:46:06.660 --> 02:46:09.660]  When do you believe the globalists are going to pull the strings
[02:46:09.660 --> 02:46:12.660]  on their Chinese and Russian minions?
[02:46:12.660 --> 02:46:14.660]  Well, as you said, they don't control them.
[02:46:14.660 --> 02:46:15.660]  They've built them up.
[02:46:15.660 --> 02:46:18.660]  I mean, when do you see this conflict being planned?
[02:46:18.660 --> 02:46:23.660]  I say that my best prediction is that it's only a 50% chance
[02:46:23.660 --> 02:46:26.660]  by the midway in this decade, 2015,
[02:46:26.660 --> 02:46:28.660]  about a 90% chance by the end of this decade.
[02:46:28.660 --> 02:46:31.660]  I frankly think it's going to take longer to pull off
[02:46:31.660 --> 02:46:36.660]  just because the Russian or China especially isn't ready yet.
[02:46:36.660 --> 02:46:40.660]  So 2020, you see NORAD standing down
[02:46:40.660 --> 02:46:43.660]  and hundreds of nukes raining down on the military.
[02:46:43.660 --> 02:46:47.660]  I see that there's a 90% probability in that time frame
[02:46:47.660 --> 02:46:49.660]  that that's where that strike is going to come.
[02:46:49.660 --> 02:46:51.660]  So we do have time to prepare.
[02:46:51.660 --> 02:46:54.660]  It isn't a panic situation, but people, you know,
[02:46:54.660 --> 02:46:56.660]  yes, we fight for liberty.
[02:46:56.660 --> 02:46:59.660]  We have to realize that we've got to be prepared for a takedown.
[02:46:59.660 --> 02:47:01.660]  In other words, it isn't enough.
[02:47:01.660 --> 02:47:03.660]  Just go blindly optimistic.
[02:47:03.660 --> 02:47:05.660]  Well, look at the globalists.
[02:47:05.660 --> 02:47:06.660]  Look at NAFTA and GATT.
[02:47:06.660 --> 02:47:07.660]  Look at the family.
[02:47:07.660 --> 02:47:10.660]  Everything they do is to destroy this Christian nation.
[02:47:10.660 --> 02:47:13.660]  That's their number one mission, and I tend to agree with you.
[02:47:13.660 --> 02:47:16.660]  I think they're going to blow the living daylights out of this country.
[02:47:16.660 --> 02:47:20.660]  And I mean, all the evidence shows they're building towards that.
[02:47:20.660 --> 02:47:23.660]  You know, it's amazing, Alex, how many in my former career
[02:47:23.660 --> 02:47:25.660]  as a high security architect, how many
[02:47:25.660 --> 02:47:28.660]  were doing jobs in Colorado and the Denver and Aspen in Colorado
[02:47:28.660 --> 02:47:31.660]  and how many times contrary to say, oh, did you know about it?
[02:47:31.660 --> 02:47:33.660]  Did you help design that bunker system for that house over there?
[02:47:33.660 --> 02:47:37.660]  He's ex-DIA and he's ex-FBI.
[02:47:37.660 --> 02:47:40.660]  And, you know, these people who've been deep into government
[02:47:40.660 --> 02:47:43.660]  in the dark side, they know this attack is coming.
[02:47:43.660 --> 02:47:45.660]  They're building bunker things and they're retreats
[02:47:45.660 --> 02:47:48.660]  out in Colorado and other ski resorts in Utah and things.
[02:47:48.660 --> 02:47:55.660]  And the contractors know about it, but the American people don't.
[02:47:55.660 --> 02:47:58.660]  Yeah, I mean, people keep saying the new world order will never win.
[02:47:58.660 --> 02:47:59.660]  They'll never get our guns.
[02:47:59.660 --> 02:48:00.660]  Oh, yeah?
[02:48:00.660 --> 02:48:04.660]  Once they blast the military bases and the infrastructure into dust
[02:48:04.660 --> 02:48:07.660]  and you'll be begging for food when the UN troops roll in.
[02:48:07.660 --> 02:48:12.660]  Let me just point out, Alex, I'm not really on board
[02:48:12.660 --> 02:48:15.660]  that I really think they're going to bring in UN troops.
[02:48:15.660 --> 02:48:19.660]  I think it's counterproductive to their whipping up major enthusiasm
[02:48:19.660 --> 02:48:21.660]  to get us into the new world order.
[02:48:21.660 --> 02:48:25.660]  I think we have outright rebellion if they try to occupy it.
[02:48:25.660 --> 02:48:27.660]  First of all, I think they're going to have enough
[02:48:27.660 --> 02:48:32.660]  private military contractors' thugs to be able to do whatever people control.
[02:48:32.660 --> 02:48:34.660]  No, no, I mean, I agree with you.
[02:48:34.660 --> 02:48:37.660]  But reading the Army documents, I'm sure you've seen these,
[02:48:37.660 --> 02:48:39.660]  but if you want them, I'll send them to you.
[02:48:39.660 --> 02:48:41.660]  They are training to bring in UN troops.
[02:48:41.660 --> 02:48:43.660]  Have you seen the deals they've signed to bring in
[02:48:43.660 --> 02:48:47.660]  Mexican and Canadian troops during terror attacks in the U.S.?
[02:48:47.660 --> 02:48:50.660]  I mean, they're openly at West Point teaching them
[02:48:50.660 --> 02:48:52.660]  that foreign troops are going to operate here.
[02:48:52.660 --> 02:48:55.660]  But we have to remember there's a difference between all the foreign troop training.
[02:48:55.660 --> 02:48:59.660]  A lot of that is to get information and military technology
[02:48:59.660 --> 02:49:02.660]  spread around to our future enemies' thugs.
[02:49:02.660 --> 02:49:07.660]  But I happen to know from my source that the Russians do not intend to occupy here.
[02:49:07.660 --> 02:49:09.660]  The Chinese do not.
[02:49:09.660 --> 02:49:15.660]  They don't want to get tangled up with millions of civilians with weapons here on that.
[02:49:15.660 --> 02:49:20.660]  But I frankly don't think it's necessary to bring in foreign troops.
[02:49:20.660 --> 02:49:23.660]  In fact, it would be counterproductive to convincing Americans to go along
[02:49:23.660 --> 02:49:27.660]  with the benevolence of the New World Order if they saw the New World Order.
[02:49:27.660 --> 02:49:29.660]  No, no, I mean, I agree they're converting.
[02:49:29.660 --> 02:49:32.660]  I mean, they have more troops in Afghanistan and Iraq
[02:49:32.660 --> 02:49:34.660]  that are mercenaries than they do regular military.
[02:49:34.660 --> 02:49:35.660]  Right.
[02:49:35.660 --> 02:49:36.660]  Joe, I agree with that.
[02:49:36.660 --> 02:49:40.660]  I'm just saying, in all the training, I mean, it's public that they're saying
[02:49:40.660 --> 02:49:45.660]  they want to use NATO slash UN to help us during emergencies.
[02:49:45.660 --> 02:49:46.660]  So they're certain.
[02:49:46.660 --> 02:49:49.660]  You're to send me some of those because I'd like to analyze that just to see.
[02:49:49.660 --> 02:49:52.660]  Let's carry on that for a future discussion.
[02:49:52.660 --> 02:49:54.660]  Alex, when I've had a chance to see that, can we do that?
[02:49:54.660 --> 02:49:55.660]  Absolutely.
[02:49:55.660 --> 02:49:57.660]  Let's try to jam in a few final calls.
[02:49:57.660 --> 02:49:59.660]  This is really gone quickly here.
[02:49:59.660 --> 02:50:00.660]  Let's talk to Paul in Ohio.
[02:50:00.660 --> 02:50:02.660]  You're on the air with Joel Scalson.
[02:50:02.660 --> 02:50:04.660]  Go ahead.
[02:50:04.660 --> 02:50:07.660]  Hey, Paul, you're on the air, buddy.
[02:50:07.660 --> 02:50:08.660]  Yeah, he's gone.
[02:50:08.660 --> 02:50:11.660]  Christopher, California, quick question.
[02:50:11.660 --> 02:50:13.660]  Hey, what's up, Alex?
[02:50:13.660 --> 02:50:14.660]  Can you guys hear me?
[02:50:14.660 --> 02:50:15.660]  Yes, I can.
[02:50:15.660 --> 02:50:16.660]  All right, cool.
[02:50:16.660 --> 02:50:18.660]  I'm excited to talk to Joel.
[02:50:18.660 --> 02:50:20.660]  I was glad to hear that he's going to be on the show.
[02:50:20.660 --> 02:50:23.660]  I have a call here from Joel and I saw a few questions for you.
[02:50:23.660 --> 02:50:27.660]  Joel, is it true that you said that I've been in a few of the
[02:50:27.660 --> 02:50:30.660]  Council for National Policy meetings and they're dull.
[02:50:30.660 --> 02:50:32.660]  There's never anything sinister going on there.
[02:50:32.660 --> 02:50:35.660]  There's no influential government policy being made there,
[02:50:35.660 --> 02:50:39.660]  that they're rather dull and that there's no conspiratial,
[02:50:39.660 --> 02:50:43.660]  there's no conspiratial activity and that they're not secretive,
[02:50:43.660 --> 02:50:45.660]  even though they refuse to release any of their meetings.
[02:50:45.660 --> 02:50:47.660]  All right, we got to go to break, but we'll come back.
[02:50:47.660 --> 02:50:51.660]  There's a left-wing CFR-funded conspiracy theory that says
[02:50:51.660 --> 02:50:54.660]  some group called the CMP runs everything.
[02:50:54.660 --> 02:51:00.660]  And it's a total diversion, but we'll talk about it on the other side.
[02:51:00.660 --> 02:51:02.660]  No one likes foreclosure.
[02:51:02.660 --> 02:51:05.660]  You won't say, think, or even consider foreclosure with
[02:51:05.660 --> 02:51:07.660]  zerodebtguarantee.com.
[02:51:07.660 --> 02:51:08.660]  Why?
[02:51:08.660 --> 02:51:12.660]  Because zerodebtguarantee.com guarantees to stop your foreclosure
[02:51:12.660 --> 02:51:15.660]  for at least two years with no payments, no bankruptcy,
[02:51:15.660 --> 02:51:16.660]  and no negotiating.
[02:51:16.660 --> 02:51:18.660]  Thinking loan modification?
[02:51:18.660 --> 02:51:19.660]  That still keeps you in default.
[02:51:19.660 --> 02:51:22.660]  Zero debt in 90 days is the only proven system that keeps you
[02:51:22.660 --> 02:51:25.660]  in your house for as long as you want to stay while making
[02:51:25.660 --> 02:51:28.660]  it possible to even get clear title to your house.
[02:51:28.660 --> 02:51:31.660]  No, we are not investors, bankers, attorneys, or real estate agents.
[02:51:31.660 --> 02:51:34.660]  We are a group of people just like you that are sick and tired
[02:51:34.660 --> 02:51:37.660]  of the housing crash, and we've helped thousands avoid foreclosure

[02:51:57.660 --> 02:52:00.660]  Guarantee to stop foreclosure.
[02:52:28.660 --> 02:52:32.660]  We have the facts.
[02:52:32.660 --> 02:52:33.660]  We have the Constitution.
[02:52:33.660 --> 02:52:34.660]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:52:34.660 --> 02:52:35.660]  We have common law.
[02:52:35.660 --> 02:52:37.660]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen,
[02:52:37.660 --> 02:52:39.660]  and I'm so excited to be able to offer you.
[02:52:39.660 --> 02:52:40.660]  Don't tread on me.
[02:52:40.660 --> 02:52:41.660]  Rise the Republic.
[02:52:41.660 --> 02:52:44.660]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant
[02:52:44.660 --> 02:52:46.660]  that is the American people is rising.
[02:52:46.660 --> 02:52:48.660]  A new tool in the Info War.
[02:52:48.660 --> 02:52:49.660]  Don't tread on me.
[02:52:49.660 --> 02:52:52.660]  Order it at infowars.com, or prisonplanet.com,
[02:52:52.660 --> 02:52:56.660]  or call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[02:52:56.660 --> 02:53:00.660]  And support independent, patriotic, liberty films.
[02:53:26.660 --> 02:53:29.660]  And see if you qualify for a reduction by up to 75%.
[02:53:29.660 --> 02:53:32.660]  Number to call is 800-902-6969.
[02:53:32.660 --> 02:53:35.660]  Again, the IRS is now accepting reduced settlements
[02:53:35.660 --> 02:53:37.660]  from consumers who owe back taxes
[02:53:37.660 --> 02:53:39.660]  in response to the decline in today's economy.
[02:53:39.660 --> 02:53:41.660]  If you are struggling with $10,000
[02:53:41.660 --> 02:53:43.660]  or more in back taxes to the IRS,
[02:53:43.660 --> 02:53:45.660]  you now may be eligible for a dramatic reduction
[02:53:45.660 --> 02:53:48.660]  by up to 75% and save thousands of dollars
[02:53:48.660 --> 02:53:49.660]  for free information.
[02:53:49.660 --> 02:53:50.660]  And to see if you qualify,
[02:53:50.660 --> 02:53:53.660]  call the open phone line into American Tax Settlement now.
[02:53:53.660 --> 02:53:56.660]  800-902-6969.
[02:53:56.660 --> 02:53:58.660]  800-902-6969.
[02:53:58.660 --> 02:54:01.660]  Again, 800-902-6969.
[02:54:01.660 --> 02:54:04.660]  Big John.
[02:54:04.660 --> 02:54:07.660]  Big John.
[02:54:07.660 --> 02:54:10.660]  Every morning at the mine, you could see him arrive.
[02:54:10.660 --> 02:54:13.660]  He stood six foot six and waited 245,
[02:54:13.660 --> 02:54:15.660]  kind of broad at his shoulder and narrowed the head.
[02:54:15.660 --> 02:54:17.660]  This is key what just got brought up.
[02:54:17.660 --> 02:54:20.660]  And I'm glad it got brought up by the caller.
[02:54:20.660 --> 02:54:22.660]  We're almost out of time.
[02:54:22.660 --> 02:54:24.660]  I wanted to go into overdrive with Joel Scalson,
[02:54:24.660 --> 02:54:26.660]  but I don't know if he could stay with us.
[02:54:26.660 --> 02:54:28.660]  I get these emails the last few years,
[02:54:28.660 --> 02:54:30.660]  you know, you're part of the CMP,
[02:54:30.660 --> 02:54:32.660]  you're part of a secret right-wing group
[02:54:32.660 --> 02:54:34.660]  more powerful than the CFR.
[02:54:34.660 --> 02:54:35.660]  So I went and researched it
[02:54:35.660 --> 02:54:37.660]  and found out the Hunt Brothers were involved in stuff
[02:54:37.660 --> 02:54:40.660]  and it looked like a right-wing attempt
[02:54:40.660 --> 02:54:42.660]  to get the government back from the globalist.
[02:54:42.660 --> 02:54:45.660]  And then it got taken over by the globalist.
[02:54:45.660 --> 02:54:49.660]  But then I noticed it was big foundation money
[02:54:49.660 --> 02:54:53.660]  and like Mother Jones and Rolling Stone
[02:54:53.660 --> 02:54:55.660]  were promoting it.
[02:54:55.660 --> 02:54:58.660]  And that's what the White House regulations are.
[02:54:58.660 --> 02:55:00.660]  Cass Sunstein says,
[02:55:00.660 --> 02:55:02.660]  we've now got the London Independent admitting
[02:55:02.660 --> 02:55:05.660]  the government is infiltrating conspiracy culture
[02:55:05.660 --> 02:55:09.660]  and posing to then attack real people.
[02:55:09.660 --> 02:55:12.660]  And, you know, I hear Joel laughing during the break
[02:55:12.660 --> 02:55:14.660]  when I asked him about this,
[02:55:14.660 --> 02:55:16.660]  but here's Joel for two hours exposing
[02:55:16.660 --> 02:55:19.660]  the Republican takeover of the Patriot movement.
[02:55:19.660 --> 02:55:21.660]  And then a caller calls in and says,
[02:55:21.660 --> 02:55:22.660]  because I've heard it all,
[02:55:22.660 --> 02:55:24.660]  you know, will you tell me about the CMP
[02:55:24.660 --> 02:55:26.660]  and then are you part of it?
[02:55:26.660 --> 02:55:29.660]  Joel, tell us about this.
[02:55:29.660 --> 02:55:33.660]  Well, I was part of the original CMP starting.
[02:55:33.660 --> 02:55:35.660]  I was there as chairman of the conservative
[02:55:35.660 --> 02:55:36.660]  national committee.
[02:55:36.660 --> 02:55:38.660]  So I have first day of information
[02:55:38.660 --> 02:55:40.660]  about how it began there.
[02:55:40.660 --> 02:55:42.660]  I was working as executive editor
[02:55:42.660 --> 02:55:45.660]  of conservative digest under Richard Bigary
[02:55:45.660 --> 02:55:49.660]  working with Howard Phillips, who's a real patriot.
[02:55:49.660 --> 02:55:53.660]  And frankly, we were making really headway
[02:55:53.660 --> 02:55:57.660]  in stopping the compromises
[02:55:57.660 --> 02:55:59.660]  the Reagan administration was involved in
[02:55:59.660 --> 02:56:02.660]  under the influence of Vice President George Bush.
[02:56:02.660 --> 02:56:04.660]  And so the CMP was started, in fact,
[02:56:04.660 --> 02:56:06.660]  just like to blunt our movement,
[02:56:06.660 --> 02:56:09.660]  just like the Tea Party movement is being blunted today.
[02:56:09.660 --> 02:56:11.660]  You had your big name Republicans move in
[02:56:11.660 --> 02:56:15.660]  and start to, like Bob Dole and Newt Gingrich
[02:56:15.660 --> 02:56:17.660]  and others came in and tried to basically
[02:56:17.660 --> 02:56:19.660]  water down our movement,
[02:56:19.660 --> 02:56:22.660]  which was to have a no compromise strategy in there.
[02:56:22.660 --> 02:56:27.660]  And so the CMP became, frankly,
[02:56:27.660 --> 02:56:31.660]  kind of a mimic of what the left was doing.
[02:56:31.660 --> 02:56:34.660]  But they had no conspiracy or tendencies except,
[02:56:34.660 --> 02:56:36.660]  and that's why they kept these things secret,
[02:56:36.660 --> 02:56:38.660]  because they wanted some heavy hitters in there
[02:56:38.660 --> 02:56:41.660]  and they charged a whale of money,
[02:56:41.660 --> 02:56:44.660]  one or $2,000 a year to be a member of the CMP.
[02:56:44.660 --> 02:56:46.660]  They did have some secrecy,
[02:56:46.660 --> 02:56:50.660]  but it wasn't anything that was conspiratorial in nature.
[02:56:50.660 --> 02:56:54.660]  Their basic movement was to co-opt our attempts
[02:56:54.660 --> 02:56:57.660]  to put some spying into the Republican Party
[02:56:57.660 --> 02:57:00.660]  and their resistance to the compromises of the Reagan administration.
[02:57:00.660 --> 02:57:02.660]  Yeah, but, Joel, then there's the spin
[02:57:02.660 --> 02:57:05.660]  that the CMP runs the whole world now.
[02:57:05.660 --> 02:57:06.660]  Joel.
[02:57:11.660 --> 02:57:13.660]  Joel, you still there?
[02:57:15.660 --> 02:57:17.660]  That was weird.
[02:57:17.660 --> 02:57:19.660]  Let's try to get Joel back on.
[02:57:19.660 --> 02:57:21.660]  It's a total distraction.
[02:57:21.660 --> 02:57:26.660]  It's like we have other Gaston who've talked about it,
[02:57:26.660 --> 02:57:28.660]  because it's interesting to see how they control
[02:57:28.660 --> 02:57:30.660]  the right wing and the left wing,
[02:57:30.660 --> 02:57:32.660]  but it's like saying the CFR runs everything
[02:57:32.660 --> 02:57:34.660]  when it really does have a lot of power
[02:57:34.660 --> 02:57:36.660]  and affects a lot of the laws,
[02:57:36.660 --> 02:57:39.660]  but they themselves are just errand boys that do it.
[02:57:39.660 --> 02:57:42.660]  You know, this interview has been really good with Joel Scalson.
[02:57:42.660 --> 02:57:44.660]  Maybe we should go into overdrive, guys.
[02:57:44.660 --> 02:57:46.660]  We haven't done that in a while.
[02:57:46.660 --> 02:57:48.660]  You guys want to go into overdrive?
[02:57:48.660 --> 02:57:50.660]  We ready to do that?
[02:57:50.660 --> 02:57:53.660]  Let's get Joel back on and see if you can go into overdrive.
[02:57:53.660 --> 02:57:55.660]  Joel, your phone got cut out there
[02:57:55.660 --> 02:57:57.660]  or something disconnected you?
[02:57:57.660 --> 02:57:59.660]  Yeah, something happened.
[02:57:59.660 --> 02:58:02.660]  Hey, listen, will you do 20 more minutes with us
[02:58:02.660 --> 02:58:04.660]  to talk about a few other issues?
[02:58:04.660 --> 02:58:06.660]  Okay, listen.
[02:58:06.660 --> 02:58:08.660]  We're going to go into overdrive, listeners,
[02:58:08.660 --> 02:58:10.660]  and that means it will be internet only.
[02:58:10.660 --> 02:58:12.660]  That's actually not true, because the network
[02:58:12.660 --> 02:58:14.660]  sends out this fourth hour on satellite,
[02:58:14.660 --> 02:58:16.660]  because I do it occasionally live still.
[02:58:16.660 --> 02:58:18.660]  So if you're a station, you'll be able to continue
[02:58:18.660 --> 02:58:20.660]  to listen to us, actually.
[02:58:20.660 --> 02:58:22.660]  I forgot that when we do overdrive now,
[02:58:22.660 --> 02:58:24.660]  it's actually on the birds and on the radio stations.
[02:58:24.660 --> 02:58:26.660]  I quit doing four hours a day a few months ago
[02:58:26.660 --> 02:58:28.660]  just because I'm working on the TV show we're developing
[02:58:28.660 --> 02:58:30.660]  and everything else.
[02:58:30.660 --> 02:58:33.660]  I mean, but occasionally, I will do the fourth hour.
[02:58:33.660 --> 02:58:35.660]  We'll do part of it right now.
[02:58:35.660 --> 02:58:38.660]  Keep listening one place, infowars.com with Joel Scalson.
[02:58:38.660 --> 02:58:40.660]  He'll be able to finish up about the CMV.
[02:58:42.660 --> 02:58:44.660]  You are listening to GCN.
[02:58:44.660 --> 02:59:00.660]  This is Alex Jones with 5 Good Reasons You Should Consider Buying a Solar Power Generator.
[02:59:15.660 --> 02:59:17.660]  And now, new socialist legislation
[02:59:17.660 --> 02:59:19.660]  is only compounding the problem.
[02:59:19.660 --> 02:59:22.660]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:59:22.660 --> 02:59:24.660]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power
[02:59:24.660 --> 02:59:26.660]  from weather-related onages.
[02:59:26.660 --> 02:59:28.660]  Number five, a solar power generator
[02:59:28.660 --> 02:59:31.660]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:59:31.660 --> 02:59:33.660]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators
[02:59:33.660 --> 02:59:36.660]  offered by Solutions from Science, one of my old sponsors.
[02:59:36.660 --> 02:59:40.660]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:59:40.660 --> 02:59:42.660]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:59:42.660 --> 02:59:44.660]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:59:44.660 --> 02:59:46.660]  So go to mysolarbackup.com
[02:59:46.660 --> 02:59:50.660]  or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:59:51.660 --> 02:59:54.660]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[02:59:54.660 --> 02:59:58.660]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:04.660 --> 03:00:06.660]  Big brother, mainstream media.
[03:00:06.660 --> 03:00:08.660]  Government cover us.
[03:00:08.660 --> 03:00:09.660]  You want answers?
[03:00:09.660 --> 03:00:11.660]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:11.660 --> 03:00:15.660]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[03:00:30.660 --> 03:00:33.660]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are in overdrive
[03:00:33.660 --> 03:00:35.660]  into the fourth hour.
[03:00:35.660 --> 03:00:37.660]  We are live with Joel Scowleson
[03:00:37.660 --> 03:00:41.660]  at worldaffairsbrief.com, we'll be able to continue with Christopher, Matt,
[03:00:41.660 --> 03:00:43.660]  Kenneth, Jeanie, and Steve.
[03:00:43.660 --> 03:00:45.660]  At least those calls.
[03:00:45.660 --> 03:00:49.660]  But we are going to end the live transmission,
[03:00:49.660 --> 03:00:53.660]  come up in about 30 minutes, and it will go back into rebroadcast.
[03:00:53.660 --> 03:00:55.660]  In fact, I'm glad he's staying with us another 30 minutes
[03:00:55.660 --> 03:00:59.660]  because I want to get into where he sees the economy going,
[03:00:59.660 --> 03:01:03.660]  what he thinks about $50 a ounce gold,
[03:01:03.660 --> 03:01:06.660]  and some other questions I've got for Joel Scowleson.
[03:01:06.660 --> 03:01:10.660]  But your line cut out when the fellow,
[03:01:10.660 --> 03:01:12.660]  you were trying to finish your answer,
[03:01:12.660 --> 03:01:15.660]  and I brought the question out about this conservative group
[03:01:15.660 --> 03:01:18.660]  that was trying to keep the Republican Party conservative,
[03:01:18.660 --> 03:01:22.660]  kind of like the Tea Party growing out of Ron Paul is today.
[03:01:22.660 --> 03:01:24.660]  And I know a lot of good people were in there early on,
[03:01:24.660 --> 03:01:27.660]  but then it became more of an establishment deal.
[03:01:27.660 --> 03:01:31.660]  But I've seen globalist publications
[03:01:31.660 --> 03:01:37.660]  try to claim that the CMP is really like the CFR.
[03:01:37.660 --> 03:01:39.660]  Yeah, absolutely not true.
[03:01:39.660 --> 03:01:44.660]  It started out with some real Goldwater type Republicans
[03:01:44.660 --> 03:01:46.660]  trying to be more conservative than Reagan.
[03:01:46.660 --> 03:01:50.660]  But it quickly got, as I say, infiltrated by the establishment Republicans
[03:01:50.660 --> 03:01:52.660]  because these people had money.
[03:01:52.660 --> 03:01:56.660]  And anybody who's got money and can project their point of view,
[03:01:56.660 --> 03:01:58.660]  that establishment's really worried.
[03:01:58.660 --> 03:02:01.660]  So they got that infiltrated and they stopped that.
[03:02:01.660 --> 03:02:04.660]  It's become a very lackluster organization
[03:02:04.660 --> 03:02:07.660]  that really doesn't do anything except collect fees.
[03:02:07.660 --> 03:02:12.660]  Well, I mean, again, here you are exposing conspiracies,
[03:02:12.660 --> 03:02:14.660]  exposing the New World Order.
[03:02:14.660 --> 03:02:17.660]  And then you have a private group that meets
[03:02:17.660 --> 03:02:20.660]  to try to keep the Republican Party conservative.
[03:02:20.660 --> 03:02:24.660]  And it turns into this whole other conspiracy theory
[03:02:24.660 --> 03:02:28.660]  put out by the Rolling Stone who makes fun of things
[03:02:28.660 --> 03:02:30.660]  like the New World Order.
[03:02:30.660 --> 03:02:31.660]  It's ridiculous.
[03:02:31.660 --> 03:02:36.660]  But regardless, I've never been part of the CMP,
[03:02:36.660 --> 03:02:39.660]  know almost nothing about it.
[03:02:39.660 --> 03:02:43.660]  Today it seems more like a vestigial thing,
[03:02:43.660 --> 03:02:46.660]  kind of like the Tea Party will be in 20 years
[03:02:46.660 --> 03:02:49.660]  if the globalists are successful at taking it over.
[03:02:49.660 --> 03:02:50.660]  What's your view on that?
[03:02:50.660 --> 03:02:51.660]  Yeah, precisely.
[03:02:51.660 --> 03:02:54.660]  It's just going to get watered down more and more
[03:02:54.660 --> 03:02:58.660]  as the Tea Party will with establishment Republican support
[03:02:58.660 --> 03:03:00.660]  of establishment Republican candidates.
[03:03:00.660 --> 03:03:01.660]  And that's all the CMP does.
[03:03:01.660 --> 03:03:04.660]  Now, I never was able to afford the membership dues.
[03:03:04.660 --> 03:03:05.660]  I was never formally a member,
[03:03:05.660 --> 03:03:07.660]  but I was there during the insipid meetings.
[03:03:07.660 --> 03:03:09.660]  And so I knew the people.
[03:03:09.660 --> 03:03:11.660]  And boy, it was amazing to sit there with Howard Fellows
[03:03:11.660 --> 03:03:13.660]  and Richard Vigory and point out, you know,
[03:03:13.660 --> 03:03:15.660]  I was kind of a novice in Washington to see
[03:03:15.660 --> 03:03:17.660]  who the big wigs were and who the infiltrators were.
[03:03:17.660 --> 03:03:20.660]  And it was a real education.
[03:03:20.660 --> 03:03:21.660]  Absolutely.
[03:03:21.660 --> 03:03:23.660]  And Howard Phillips has been fighting
[03:03:23.660 --> 03:03:25.660]  the New World Order forever.
[03:03:25.660 --> 03:03:26.660]  That's right.
[03:03:26.660 --> 03:03:28.660]  And very straight shooter.
[03:03:28.660 --> 03:03:30.660]  Well, you know, that's who should,
[03:03:30.660 --> 03:03:33.660]  I mean, if Fox News was for real, it'd be Joel Scalzen.
[03:03:33.660 --> 03:03:35.660]  It'd be Howard Phillips, very well-spoken.
[03:03:35.660 --> 03:03:37.660]  It'd be Ron Paul.
[03:03:37.660 --> 03:03:41.660]  But I think them moving with Judge Andrew Napolitano,
[03:03:41.660 --> 03:03:43.660]  they just know there's two higher ratings associated
[03:03:43.660 --> 03:03:47.660]  with, you know, with true constitutional views.
[03:03:47.660 --> 03:03:50.660]  I mean, look at him, within his show being two weeks old
[03:03:50.660 --> 03:03:53.660]  on Fox Business, it had more viewers in a weekend
[03:03:53.660 --> 03:03:56.660]  than all other shows combined.
[03:03:56.660 --> 03:03:58.660]  I mean, he should instantly have a show on Fox,
[03:03:58.660 --> 03:04:00.660]  but you don't see that happening.
[03:04:00.660 --> 03:04:03.660]  No, he's very, very credible, and that's what they don't want.
[03:04:03.660 --> 03:04:05.660]  They don't want credible spokesmen on our side
[03:04:05.660 --> 03:04:07.660]  of the spectrum.
[03:04:07.660 --> 03:04:09.660]  Well, then why are they letting him dominate
[03:04:09.660 --> 03:04:12.660]  with a once-a-week show on Fox Business?
[03:04:12.660 --> 03:04:14.660]  Well, he's still having to be careful.
[03:04:14.660 --> 03:04:16.660]  I mean, he said some real truthful things,
[03:04:16.660 --> 03:04:18.660]  but you know that he hasn't got into
[03:04:18.660 --> 03:04:22.660]  real deep conspiracy theory, in fact.
[03:04:22.660 --> 03:04:24.660]  Yeah, I'll just keep my mouth shut,
[03:04:24.660 --> 03:04:26.660]  but I've talked to him off air.
[03:04:26.660 --> 03:04:28.660]  He's for real. He knows...
[03:04:28.660 --> 03:04:30.660]  No, he is. He absolutely is,
[03:04:30.660 --> 03:04:33.660]  but I think he's been told there are limits.
[03:04:33.660 --> 03:04:35.660]  All right, we're going to come back
[03:04:35.660 --> 03:04:36.660]  and go to Christopher, Matt, Kenneth,
[03:04:36.660 --> 03:04:38.660]  Jenny, and Steve, and then I'm going to ask
[03:04:38.660 --> 03:04:40.660]  a few important questions of Joel Scalzen,
[03:04:40.660 --> 03:04:43.660]  World's Affairs, brief.com.
[03:04:43.660 --> 03:04:45.660]  Our websites are infowars.com
[03:04:45.660 --> 03:04:47.660]  and prismplanet.tv.
[03:04:47.660 --> 03:04:49.660]  We'll be right back after this break.
[03:04:49.660 --> 03:04:51.660]  We're in live overdrive with Joel Scalzen.
[03:04:51.660 --> 03:04:53.660]  Very interesting and informative stuff.
[03:04:53.660 --> 03:05:16.660]  Stay with us.
[03:05:23.660 --> 03:05:25.660]  In America, the Trilateral Commission
[03:05:25.660 --> 03:05:27.660]  would control the world.
[03:05:27.660 --> 03:05:29.660]  Invisible Empire Chronicles,
[03:05:29.660 --> 03:05:31.660]  how men of power and influence
[03:05:31.660 --> 03:05:33.660]  have worked in stealth for centuries
[03:05:33.660 --> 03:05:35.660]  to establish an oppressive world government.
[03:05:35.660 --> 03:05:37.660]  I believe, first of all, that we now need
[03:05:37.660 --> 03:05:39.660]  nothing short of a world constitution
[03:05:39.660 --> 03:05:41.660]  for the global financial system.
[03:05:41.660 --> 03:05:43.660]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[03:05:43.660 --> 03:05:45.660]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite
[03:05:45.660 --> 03:05:47.660]  and then everyone else.
[03:05:47.660 --> 03:05:49.660]  And I got news for you. You're everyone else.
[03:05:49.660 --> 03:05:51.660]  Invisible Empire.
[03:05:51.660 --> 03:05:53.660]  We'll be right back after this break.
[03:06:21.660 --> 03:06:23.660]  Our goal, of course, is to have everybody die
[03:06:23.660 --> 03:06:25.660]  after 120.
[03:06:25.660 --> 03:06:27.660]  I don't care if it's 150 or 200, whatever it is.
[03:06:27.660 --> 03:06:29.660]  We have the capacity, we have the knowledge
[03:06:29.660 --> 03:06:31.660]  to get you well beyond 100.
[03:06:31.660 --> 03:06:33.660]  Everybody, when they die past 120,
[03:06:33.660 --> 03:06:35.660]  should only have two pieces of paper
[03:06:35.660 --> 03:06:37.660]  in your health chart.
[03:06:37.660 --> 03:06:39.660]  A birth certificate and a death certificate.
[03:06:39.660 --> 03:06:41.660]  If you have a four-inch thick health chart
[03:06:41.660 --> 03:06:43.660]  full of all these surgeries and all these diseases,
[03:06:43.660 --> 03:06:45.660]  you're dying.
[03:06:45.660 --> 03:06:47.660]  You're dying.
[03:06:47.660 --> 03:06:49.660]  You're dying.
[03:06:49.660 --> 03:06:51.660]  And with all these surgeries and all these diseases,
[03:06:51.660 --> 03:06:53.660]  your doctor has failed you, the system has failed you.
[03:06:53.660 --> 03:06:55.660]  People when they think of health,
[03:06:55.660 --> 03:06:57.660]  well, I'm not going to run to the doctor,
[03:06:57.660 --> 03:06:59.660]  I can do this myself.
[03:06:59.660 --> 03:07:01.660]  Just like when you're going to lay towel in your house.
[03:07:01.660 --> 03:07:03.660]  Is everybody call a contractor now and all they say,
[03:07:03.660 --> 03:07:05.660]  I'm going to run to Home Depot and price some tile there.
[03:07:05.660 --> 03:07:07.660]  Hey, it's MZ.
[03:07:07.660 --> 03:07:09.660]  That's the beginning of an inspiring and masterful health
[03:07:09.660 --> 03:07:11.660]  lecture by Dr. Joel Wallach.
[03:07:11.660 --> 03:07:13.660]  Like Alex Jones,
[03:07:13.660 --> 03:07:15.660]  doc has been subject to ridicule by mainstream forces
[03:07:15.660 --> 03:07:17.660]  just for telling the truth.
[03:07:17.660 --> 03:07:23.300]  hear the Deadly Recipes lecture, listen to it in full at DeadlyRecipes.com and please
[03:07:23.300 --> 03:07:27.940]  help us spread the message of the real and simple way to fix healthcare in America.
[03:07:27.940 --> 03:07:28.940]  Remember, DeadlyRecipes.com.
[03:07:28.940 --> 03:07:31.940]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[03:07:31.940 --> 03:07:35.620]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold
[03:07:35.620 --> 03:07:36.620]  IRAs?
[03:07:36.620 --> 03:07:40.740]  They've been available since 1986 yet the financial industry won't recognize the value
[03:07:40.740 --> 03:07:42.420]  of gold for your retirement.
[03:07:42.420 --> 03:07:45.900]  Gold is outperformed paper investments yet no word about IRAs.
[03:07:45.900 --> 03:07:50.780]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement call 800-686-2237.
[03:07:50.780 --> 03:07:56.500]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns call 800-686-2237.
[03:07:56.500 --> 03:08:00.500]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[03:08:00.500 --> 03:08:15.860]  This is our land.
[03:08:15.860 --> 03:08:25.860]  These are our people, the workers, the strikers, the builders.
[03:08:25.860 --> 03:08:28.860]  These are our people.
[03:08:28.860 --> 03:08:31.860]  Who are they?
[03:08:31.860 --> 03:08:41.860]  They are the dark armies, the dark murdering armies whose only honor is atrocities.
[03:08:41.860 --> 03:08:51.860]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:08:51.860 --> 03:08:58.860]  You're listening to the Alex Jolley Show.
[03:08:58.860 --> 03:09:01.860]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:09:01.860 --> 03:09:05.860]  Joe Scalson of worldaffairsbrief.com is our guest.
[03:09:05.860 --> 03:09:07.860]  What an amazing discussion we've had today.
[03:09:07.860 --> 03:09:10.860]  Now I said I'd go back to Christopher with his CMP stuff.
[03:09:10.860 --> 03:09:13.860]  Then we're going to go to Kenneth, Steve, Jeanie, and Paul.
[03:09:13.860 --> 03:09:17.860]  Then I've got a few final questions for Joe Scalson who's been very gracious with his time today.
[03:09:17.860 --> 03:09:21.860]  You can subscribe to the worldaffairsbrief at worldaffairsbrief.com.
[03:09:21.860 --> 03:09:26.860]  Okay, let's go ahead now and go to Kenneth in Michigan.
[03:09:26.860 --> 03:09:28.860]  You're on the air. Go ahead.
[03:09:28.860 --> 03:09:29.860]  Hey, Alex.
[03:09:29.860 --> 03:09:30.860]  Hey, buddy.
[03:09:30.860 --> 03:09:37.860]  Yes, the other day you read an article on a GROTC program.
[03:09:37.860 --> 03:09:45.860]  I wanted to tell you that I was in an GROTC program right after 9-11.
[03:09:45.860 --> 03:09:48.860]  I know exactly what you're talking about.
[03:09:48.860 --> 03:09:52.860]  They're turning these kids into fucking robots.
[03:09:52.860 --> 03:09:54.860]  You know what I'm saying?
[03:09:54.860 --> 03:10:04.860]  That's what really woke me up because they had 11 general orders, right?
[03:10:04.860 --> 03:10:07.860]  You know what the general orders are for military people?
[03:10:07.860 --> 03:10:08.860]  Yes.
[03:10:08.860 --> 03:10:10.860]  Well, they're supposedly a 12.
[03:10:10.860 --> 03:10:13.860]  They wouldn't give us.
[03:10:13.860 --> 03:10:24.860]  And the 12th order I found out was to not follow illegal orders that go contrary to the Constitution.
[03:10:24.860 --> 03:10:27.860]  You understand what I'm saying?
[03:10:27.860 --> 03:10:28.860]  Yes.
[03:10:28.860 --> 03:10:33.860]  I mean, for those that don't know, and I appreciate your call, Kenneth, I've got to move quick here.
[03:10:33.860 --> 03:10:38.860]  They are fully federalizing local police, the threat fusion centers, the public schools,
[03:10:38.860 --> 03:10:45.860]  and under federal legislation, they are going in and turning kindergarten into junior ROTC.
[03:10:45.860 --> 03:10:51.860]  And then they, by high school, they threaten them to sign up for the military or they'll be arrested.
[03:10:51.860 --> 03:10:53.860]  It's all color of law.
[03:10:53.860 --> 03:10:58.860]  And it's part of this complete federalization of society.
[03:10:58.860 --> 03:11:01.860]  Joel Scalson, any comments on that?
[03:11:01.860 --> 03:11:10.860]  Well, you know, I tried for years in the military to get the government and I was an officer in the Marine Corps to try to say and define what is an illegal order.
[03:11:10.860 --> 03:11:11.860]  They refused to do so.
[03:11:11.860 --> 03:11:19.860]  They give lip service to the fact, you know, speaking of oath keepers and other things of what would be an illegal order, but they continue to drum into you.
[03:11:19.860 --> 03:11:23.860]  You shall assume that there are no illegal orders and you follow orders.
[03:11:23.860 --> 03:11:30.860]  And that's the kind of mentality they're putting into these new conscripts.
[03:11:30.860 --> 03:11:37.860]  That is the type of mentality and to just turn your children over to army recruiters when they're in kindergarten.
[03:11:37.860 --> 03:11:45.860]  I mean, is this a mark of a free society to have 180 troops at one school in Alaska?
[03:11:45.860 --> 03:11:47.860]  That's just one example.
[03:11:47.860 --> 03:11:52.860]  Literally, quote, training the children to accept a military presence.
[03:11:52.860 --> 03:11:55.860]  I mean, that's acclimation, Joel.
[03:11:55.860 --> 03:12:00.860]  Yeah, it's inappropriate and, you know, it isn't widespread.
[03:12:00.860 --> 03:12:05.860]  Certainly, these are exceptions right now, but they are a trend that we can see continuing someday in the future.
[03:12:05.860 --> 03:12:06.860]  Absolutely.
[03:12:06.860 --> 03:12:07.860]  Kenneth, interesting points.
[03:12:07.860 --> 03:12:09.860]  Let's talk to Stephen Oklahoma.
[03:12:09.860 --> 03:12:11.860]  Steve, you're on the air.
[03:12:11.860 --> 03:12:12.860]  Alex, how are you doing?
[03:12:12.860 --> 03:12:13.860]  Good.
[03:12:13.860 --> 03:12:14.860]  Good to see you.
[03:12:14.860 --> 03:12:19.860]  You had mentioned way earlier in the show something about being a whistleblower.
[03:12:19.860 --> 03:12:22.860]  You guys actually touched on that at one point in time.
[03:12:22.860 --> 03:12:29.860]  Yeah, no, we were talking about getting whistleblowers to go forward about not just the MIAC report and other things,
[03:12:29.860 --> 03:12:31.860]  but government drug dealing.
[03:12:31.860 --> 03:12:32.860]  That's happening.
[03:12:32.860 --> 03:12:38.860]  And Joel was saying that's why they're trying to convert over to contractors because they found it's easier to control them
[03:12:38.860 --> 03:12:42.860]  and to have a nest of dark side criminals.
[03:12:42.860 --> 03:12:43.860]  Right.
[03:12:43.860 --> 03:12:50.860]  Well, I used to work for one of the major defense firms and I had a TSSDI clearance.
[03:12:50.860 --> 03:12:57.860]  And the problem is you signed a huge stack of papers stating that you won't even breathe.
[03:12:57.860 --> 03:13:00.860]  You're not even supposed to be able to tell your wife you actually have a clearance.
[03:13:00.860 --> 03:13:03.860]  I mean, you're not supposed to tell anybody.
[03:13:03.860 --> 03:13:12.860]  And if you even breathe, they scare you so bad thinking that you can't say anything for 40 years or something like that,
[03:13:12.860 --> 03:13:18.860]  that you have to be really, really, really careful about even thinking about saying stuff like that.
[03:13:18.860 --> 03:13:20.860]  Well, look, here's the deal.
[03:13:20.860 --> 03:13:26.860]  Whether it's a security clearance or a nondisclosure thing or any of that in private business or government,
[03:13:26.860 --> 03:13:31.860]  if something is illegal or immoral, the contracts don't count.
[03:13:31.860 --> 03:13:34.860]  And that goes back to the Nuremberg defense if I was just following orders.
[03:13:34.860 --> 03:13:36.860]  Let's get Joel Scalson's take.
[03:13:36.860 --> 03:13:38.860]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[03:13:38.860 --> 03:13:39.860]  There is law.
[03:13:39.860 --> 03:13:43.860]  There are laws that basically protect people, but they aren't being enforced by the judges.
[03:13:43.860 --> 03:13:44.860]  That's the problem.
[03:13:44.860 --> 03:13:46.860]  They will take you down.
[03:13:46.860 --> 03:13:52.860]  And that's why in my call to whistleblowers, what I'm calling for is come and do it privately.
[03:13:52.860 --> 03:13:54.860]  Talk anonymously.
[03:13:54.860 --> 03:13:56.860]  You can trust us to keep the secret.
[03:13:56.860 --> 03:14:01.860]  What I'm saying is that we need to at least know the information because then we can go and ferret it out
[03:14:01.860 --> 03:14:04.860]  and we can expose things even if we don't have to tell your name.
[03:14:04.860 --> 03:14:08.860]  Well, that's why they're scared of things like WikiLeaks, whether it's control or not.
[03:14:08.860 --> 03:14:09.860]  Exactly.
[03:14:09.860 --> 03:14:10.860]  Exactly.
[03:14:10.860 --> 03:14:14.860]  They're afraid of the truth alone coming out even if we don't and can't say the source.
[03:14:14.860 --> 03:14:18.860]  But the mainstream media gets away with it all the time saying, we have an anonymous source.
[03:14:18.860 --> 03:14:19.860]  I'm not allowed to reveal it.
[03:14:19.860 --> 03:14:25.860]  We can do the same game, but we need whistleblowers to come out and say it in a timely manner.
[03:14:25.860 --> 03:14:30.860]  I mean, we've got people coming off the grassy knoll admitting that they were working for both the CIA and mafia
[03:14:30.860 --> 03:14:33.860]  and shot President Kennedy, but they were right before their death.
[03:14:33.860 --> 03:14:39.860]  You know, and it's very difficult to make use of that information 40 years after the fact.
[03:14:39.860 --> 03:14:40.860]  Absolutely.
[03:14:40.860 --> 03:14:44.860]  It's all coming out on a separate issue before we go back to calls.
[03:14:44.860 --> 03:14:47.860]  Mexican massacre investigator found dead.
[03:14:47.860 --> 03:14:53.860]  The local investigator who was looking into the 72 immigrants from Central and South America,
[03:14:53.860 --> 03:14:58.860]  who the drug cartels were killing because they didn't have money to pay them off.
[03:14:58.860 --> 03:15:02.860]  Arizona Sheriff says the Border Patrol is pulling out of Southern Arizona.
[03:15:02.860 --> 03:15:08.860]  CNS News Brewer condemns report to UN mentioning Arizona law.
[03:15:08.860 --> 03:15:11.860]  Mexicans fear cartels are winning.
[03:15:11.860 --> 03:15:14.860]  And it just goes on from there.
[03:15:14.860 --> 03:15:18.860]  My intel from former DEA agents and others is Los Zetas.
[03:15:18.860 --> 03:15:24.860]  And we said this six years ago before it all started was being trained by the CIA.
[03:15:24.860 --> 03:15:26.860]  They're quote, former Mexican military.
[03:15:26.860 --> 03:15:34.860]  They're really been sheep dipped to attack the other four cartels to five cartels that don't pay their cuts to the big globalist banks,
[03:15:34.860 --> 03:15:40.860]  just like the fart gorilla are being attacked in Columbia for not laundering their money through the stock market.
[03:15:40.860 --> 03:15:41.860]  That's even in Reuters.
[03:15:41.860 --> 03:15:46.860]  And that this whole thing is a destabilization program to knock out their competition,
[03:15:46.860 --> 03:15:56.860]  to have the border crisis be so bad that we will accept the North American Union as the SPP document state as the so-called solution.
[03:15:56.860 --> 03:16:01.860]  Jules Galson, A, what is the situation in Mexico from your research?
[03:16:01.860 --> 03:16:03.860]  B, what do you think's behind it?
[03:16:03.860 --> 03:16:05.860]  Well, you've really covered that very, very well.
[03:16:05.860 --> 03:16:09.860]  First of all, there is an official drug pipeline connected with Mexico.
[03:16:09.860 --> 03:16:15.860]  The trucks that are sealed on the Mexican side of the border that come across to San Diego have drugs in.
[03:16:15.860 --> 03:16:16.860]  The dogs go wild.
[03:16:16.860 --> 03:16:18.860]  They can smell the drugs on them.
[03:16:18.860 --> 03:16:21.860]  And every time a DEA agent goes up to try to say, can we break the seal?
[03:16:21.860 --> 03:16:23.860]  Can we block this?
[03:16:23.860 --> 03:16:25.860]  Washington says no.
[03:16:25.860 --> 03:16:26.860]  You cannot intervene.
[03:16:26.860 --> 03:16:33.860]  So there is a real Mexican-US CIA drug pipeline going on.
[03:16:33.860 --> 03:16:37.860]  You're absolutely right, because these drug wars are involving competitors.
[03:16:37.860 --> 03:16:41.860]  There will always be competitors trying to get in on this very lucrative trade.
[03:16:41.860 --> 03:16:46.860]  And there's always infighting going on with people trying to take a bigger cut.
[03:16:46.860 --> 03:16:48.860]  The CIA always having to discipline.
[03:16:48.860 --> 03:16:52.860]  And they use the Mexican mafia, essentially, to do that, discipline to them.
[03:16:52.860 --> 03:16:57.860]  And that's what explains the Mexican troops coming across the border in support of drug.
[03:16:57.860 --> 03:17:03.860]  Those are mostly, you know, U.S. approved drug shipments that are coming across.
[03:17:03.860 --> 03:17:10.860]  But sometimes, because Mexico is so corrupt, the Mexican military itself is bought off by the competing people with higher money,
[03:17:10.860 --> 03:17:12.860]  and that's why the U.S. has a problem with it.
[03:17:12.860 --> 03:17:16.860]  They don't know which Mexican troops coming across the border are their own boys,
[03:17:16.860 --> 03:17:18.860]  or which ones are belonging to the other cartels.
[03:17:18.860 --> 03:17:24.860]  But you're absolutely right about the last comment that this whole thing is allowed to fester and get worse,
[03:17:24.860 --> 03:17:33.860]  because the solution to the Hegelian conflict will be we have to have a joint military protected regime across the border,
[03:17:33.860 --> 03:17:36.860]  and it'll be part of the North American Union.
[03:17:36.860 --> 03:17:39.860]  I'm not sure they're going to get there, but that's where they're in.
[03:17:39.860 --> 03:17:48.860]  Well said, Joel Scalson. I totally agree with you, and we were able with our sources to predict all this before these flare-ups the last five years.
[03:17:48.860 --> 03:17:53.860]  And my concern is, is that it's degenerating, and Mexico's a failed state,
[03:17:53.860 --> 03:17:59.860]  and it's going to generate more of these desperate people who I don't blame wanting to come here.
[03:17:59.860 --> 03:18:04.860]  But once they get here, they're being used as tools by the Ford Foundation,
[03:18:04.860 --> 03:18:09.860]  William Melinda Gates, their own record funding, this whole Osloan movement.
[03:18:09.860 --> 03:18:13.860]  Absolutely right. And they're funding LaRossa and other radical groups as well.
[03:18:13.860 --> 03:18:18.860]  They want this conflict between the Mexican Americans so that they can say,
[03:18:18.860 --> 03:18:23.860]  well, we need another comprehensive entity that will feed increased illegal immigration all the while.
[03:18:23.860 --> 03:18:30.860]  Of course, they won't stop the fence, or build the fence, which would, in fact, stop 95 percent of it immediately,
[03:18:30.860 --> 03:18:34.460]  and take all of the pressure, most of the pressure off the border.
[03:18:34.460 --> 03:18:35.460]  That's right.
[03:18:35.460 --> 03:18:36.460]  Real fast.
[03:18:36.460 --> 03:18:38.060]  Jeannie in Texas, you're on the air.
[03:18:38.060 --> 03:18:39.060]  Hi, Joel.
[03:18:39.060 --> 03:18:40.060]  Hi, Alex.
[03:18:40.060 --> 03:18:41.060]  Hi, Joel.
[03:18:41.060 --> 03:18:42.620]  I'm going to talk very quickly.
[03:18:42.620 --> 03:18:45.220]  My husband's been unemployed for a year and a half.
[03:18:45.220 --> 03:18:46.980]  He just got a job a week ago.
[03:18:46.980 --> 03:18:48.340]  We don't know if it's permanent yet.
[03:18:48.340 --> 03:18:53.460]  But the reason I'm calling is to let y'all know that I did call the labor force of Statistics
[03:18:53.460 --> 03:18:58.580]  Bureau because I wanted to know where they get that 9.7% of unemployment.
[03:18:58.580 --> 03:19:01.780]  And I told him that my husband is not eligible for unemployment.
[03:19:01.780 --> 03:19:05.820]  All these construction workers, though, you know, were not being counted.
[03:19:05.820 --> 03:19:13.860]  And anyway, he told me that the Statistics Bureau pays the U.S. Census to conduct a current
[03:19:13.860 --> 03:19:18.420]  population survey on 60,000 households, if you can believe that.
[03:19:18.420 --> 03:19:20.180]  I feel that's not accurate.
[03:19:20.180 --> 03:19:26.020]  And also, he said, oh, in construction, it's 15.9% unemployment.
[03:19:26.020 --> 03:19:28.740]  I just want people to know what people are hurting.
[03:19:28.740 --> 03:19:30.980]  They're not telling the truth of how many people are...
[03:19:30.980 --> 03:19:37.380]  Jeannie, stay there.
[03:19:37.380 --> 03:19:39.340]  Afraid to answer it?
[03:19:39.340 --> 03:19:41.340]  Afraid to answer your door?
[03:19:41.340 --> 03:19:45.540]  Did you know that debt settlement, bankruptcy, and attorneys will cost you about 10 times
[03:19:45.540 --> 03:19:48.660]  more than you would legally be required to pay creditors?
[03:19:48.660 --> 03:19:50.820]  These are not ways to help you get out of debt.
[03:19:50.820 --> 03:19:52.860]  They are expensive payment plans.
[03:19:52.860 --> 03:19:56.940]  And if you're in debt already, does it make sense to load yourself up with another payment
[03:19:56.940 --> 03:19:57.940]  plan?
[03:19:57.940 --> 03:20:02.100]  Zero debt in 90 days gets you out of debt in 90 days, guaranteed.

[03:20:31.980 --> 03:20:32.980]  Gold.
[03:20:32.980 --> 03:20:35.020]  It's like nothing else on earth.
[03:20:35.020 --> 03:20:39.460]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the industrial age to the space age, gold
[03:20:39.460 --> 03:20:41.260]  has weathered the test of time.
[03:20:41.260 --> 03:20:45.620]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[03:20:45.620 --> 03:20:49.740]  According to the World Gold Council in the US Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[03:20:49.740 --> 03:20:54.220]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common sense alternative to
[03:20:54.220 --> 03:20:58.100]  a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.
[03:20:58.100 --> 03:21:02.780]  Midas Resources is proud to offer the hard-hitting report that arms you with the truth you need
[03:21:02.780 --> 03:21:07.060]  to protect you and your family from the Fed's plans for your hard-earned money.

[03:21:27.820 --> 03:21:32.140]  Call Midas today at 800-686-2237.
[03:21:32.140 --> 03:21:37.020]  The question is where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[03:21:37.020 --> 03:21:38.020]  What have we got?
[03:21:38.020 --> 03:21:40.420]  A republic or a monarchy?
[03:21:40.420 --> 03:21:44.340]  A republic is based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[03:21:44.340 --> 03:21:48.520]  Not democracy, not mob rule, two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[03:21:48.520 --> 03:21:53.220]  Well they think they own our land, they think they own our water, children, our education,
[03:21:53.220 --> 03:21:54.220]  our money.
[03:21:54.220 --> 03:21:58.300]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[03:21:58.300 --> 03:22:01.820]  Somebody's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot uprising.
[03:22:01.820 --> 03:22:02.820]  You are being warned.
[03:22:02.820 --> 03:22:04.060]  We have the facts.
[03:22:04.060 --> 03:22:05.220]  We have the constitution.
[03:22:05.220 --> 03:22:06.220]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[03:22:06.220 --> 03:22:07.220]  We have common law.
[03:22:07.220 --> 03:22:11.580]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm so excited to be able to offer you.
[03:22:11.580 --> 03:22:12.580]  Don't tread on me.
[03:22:12.580 --> 03:22:13.580]  Rise of the Republic.
[03:22:13.580 --> 03:22:18.260]  No tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[03:22:18.260 --> 03:22:20.060]  A new tool in the Info War.
[03:22:20.060 --> 03:22:21.060]  Don't tread on me.
[03:22:21.060 --> 03:22:29.180]  Order it at infowars.com or prisonplanet.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139 and support
[03:22:29.180 --> 03:22:32.580]  independent patriotic liberty films.
[03:22:32.580 --> 03:22:35.340]  Thousands of Americans are facing evacuation.
[03:22:35.340 --> 03:22:40.540]  If you or any of your loved ones might need to evacuate, you must do it yourselves.
[03:22:40.540 --> 03:22:43.260]  Please don't procrastinate until they do it for you.
[03:22:43.260 --> 03:22:46.940]  Remember the terrible conditions of those that didn't get out for Katrina.
[03:22:46.940 --> 03:22:54.740]  Go right now to efoodsdirect.com slash alex or call 800-409-5633 for information on the
[03:22:54.740 --> 03:22:56.980]  new evacuation pack.
[03:22:56.980 --> 03:23:02.420]  It contains two weeks of delicious, easy-to-fix food along with the equipment to prepare it.
[03:23:02.420 --> 03:23:06.180]  It's packed in a rugged heavy-duty tote for transport.
[03:23:06.180 --> 03:23:09.780]  Evacuations are looming with the storms and the Gulf oil catastrophe.
[03:23:09.780 --> 03:23:15.180]  No matter where you live, wildfires, earthquakes, floods and storms must be escaped.
[03:23:15.180 --> 03:23:18.820]  Don't be like a deer frozen in the headlights of oncoming disaster.
[03:23:18.820 --> 03:23:23.900]  At least prepare yourself with this two-week evacuation pack from efoodsdirect.com.
[03:23:23.900 --> 03:23:41.340]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com slash alex.
[03:23:41.340 --> 03:23:46.900]  Well I tell you, the time has just flown by which old scowls are joining us today.
[03:23:46.900 --> 03:23:55.700]  Jeannie was bringing up the unemployment statistics, most economists agree it's over 22% and so
[03:23:55.700 --> 03:24:03.140]  so much of what they're doing skewed but that was one of my final questions for Joel Scoulson.
[03:24:03.140 --> 03:24:05.580]  What is your take on these cook numbers?
[03:24:05.580 --> 03:24:08.940]  Well they're absolutely cook, for example she mentioned that they admitted to her that
[03:24:08.940 --> 03:24:15.540]  the construction unemployment was 15%, it's over 30% in the construction industry and that's
[03:24:15.540 --> 03:24:20.420]  being very generous, I mean literally anybody and I've got a son in the construction industry
[03:24:20.420 --> 03:24:26.140]  and there's only 25% that he can find that have jobs remaining and if it weren't for
[03:24:26.140 --> 03:24:30.180]  of course all of the stimulus money flowing out there wouldn't be a lot of construction
[03:24:30.180 --> 03:24:35.820]  in the major road crews which are pretty full right now because of the stimulus money.
[03:24:35.820 --> 03:24:40.420]  But you see an ongoing rotting though, you don't see it plunging, you see it rotting.
[03:24:40.420 --> 03:24:44.420]  That's right, I do not believe that it's in the best interest of the establishment to
[03:24:44.420 --> 03:24:50.140]  let this thing fall, that would only engender a great deal of mechanisms to have change
[03:24:50.140 --> 03:24:52.980]  and they don't want that, they want people to stay the course.
[03:24:52.980 --> 03:24:58.340]  I think they've got a tremendous amount of ability to inflate still, you've got to remember
[03:24:58.340 --> 03:25:03.780]  that we've got a basis of over $200 trillion that have been monetized so far so the $3 trillion
[03:25:03.780 --> 03:25:09.980]  they threw at the bailout was only 1.5% inflation of the money supply, that's not hyperinflation.
[03:25:09.980 --> 03:25:14.980]  I spent this entire week's world affairs brief explaining to people why it's almost
[03:25:14.980 --> 03:25:20.220]  impossible to have hyperinflation without the structure in the government to inject
[03:25:20.220 --> 03:25:24.180]  money directly into the pocketbooks of consumers which we don't have.
[03:25:24.180 --> 03:25:30.780]  They did it twice now with stimulus bills of $180 billion and it was directly inflationary.
[03:25:30.780 --> 03:25:33.940]  But to get the hyperinflation you've got to have that going on every single month in
[03:25:33.940 --> 03:25:34.940]  increasing expenditure.
[03:25:34.940 --> 03:25:41.140]  But we are starting to go down that road, well the injection is happening in what I
[03:25:41.140 --> 03:25:45.500]  call the speculative economy, that's the one that are getting the injections from it,
[03:25:45.500 --> 03:25:50.100]  that's not particularly inflationary because there's only about a 20% overlap with the
[03:25:50.100 --> 03:25:51.100]  real economy.
[03:25:51.100 --> 03:25:56.620]  That's right, so the ultra rich are sucking up most of this while propping up their system.
[03:25:56.620 --> 03:26:00.540]  They're speculating, they're running into forex in the commodities and derivatives markets
[03:26:00.540 --> 03:26:06.180]  and spending that money and earning 5 to 15% on it whereas we're stuck in the real economy
[03:26:06.180 --> 03:26:07.700]  making 1.5% of that.
[03:26:07.700 --> 03:26:11.700]  And that's why they want carbon taxes, that's why all the big banks fund those because it's
[03:26:11.700 --> 03:26:14.900]  the false economy waging war against the real economy.
[03:26:14.900 --> 03:26:22.860]  Jeannie, I'm sorry it's so tough on you, they want to use poverty as a tool of control and
[03:26:22.860 --> 03:26:27.420]  we've got to get this economy going again and we can only do that by cutting taxes
[03:26:27.420 --> 03:26:31.980]  and cutting defense spending and cutting welfare but I'm glad to hear your husband
[03:26:31.980 --> 03:26:33.860]  got a job Jeannie.
[03:26:33.860 --> 03:26:37.300]  Thank you and I just want people to know in the world that people are still hurting,
[03:26:37.300 --> 03:26:42.180]  I mean I'm actually collecting unemployment, I have a job but they cut hours, the check
[03:26:42.180 --> 03:26:45.140]  I have coming on the 8th has 14 hours on it.
[03:26:45.140 --> 03:26:50.300]  So I want people to know, I call this bureau because I didn't feel it was honest and people
[03:26:50.300 --> 03:26:54.420]  like my husband weren't being counted and I'm just sick of it.
[03:26:54.420 --> 03:26:59.700]  You heard Joel and I've seen those numbers as well, over 30% for construction workers,
[03:26:59.700 --> 03:27:00.700]  God bless you.
[03:27:00.700 --> 03:27:04.660]  One last call quickly for Joel Scalson, Paul in Ohio, you're on the air.
[03:27:04.660 --> 03:27:10.700]  Yeah, this is Paul from Ohio and I just wanted to tell you that fluoride is pretty bad but
[03:27:10.700 --> 03:27:13.420]  fluoride withdraw is even worse Alex.
[03:27:13.420 --> 03:27:19.980]  I lived through it and I just had a relative that just lived through it and they've got
[03:27:19.980 --> 03:27:23.860]  a weapon there, all they've got to do is take the fluoride out of the water and you're going
[03:27:23.860 --> 03:27:27.780]  to have a lot of crazy people, what do you think of that?
[03:27:27.780 --> 03:27:32.900]  I appreciate your call, Joel I never got to that but have you seen all these Rockefeller
[03:27:32.900 --> 03:27:38.220]  Foundation documents where they admit they developed vaccines to sterilize people and
[03:27:38.220 --> 03:27:42.940]  now they're on the news promoting lithium in the water to make us submit, what's your
[03:27:42.940 --> 03:27:44.740]  view on that?
[03:27:44.740 --> 03:27:50.260]  Well there's a real backlash against fluoride now in the water supply, I don't think they're
[03:27:50.260 --> 03:27:55.220]  going to get to the point of putting mood-altering drugs into the water side but you know you
[03:27:55.220 --> 03:27:59.700]  can't really trust what they do, even the chlorine is bad for people especially in the
[03:27:59.700 --> 03:28:04.940]  heavy doses they put it in to make sure that they do shock treatment on it, frankly I don't
[03:28:04.940 --> 03:28:08.460]  think anybody ought to be drinking the water, the public water supply.
[03:28:08.460 --> 03:28:14.180]  I totally agree with you, worldaffairsbrief.com, you've got a new one coming out in two days
[03:28:14.180 --> 03:28:18.900]  folks can go there and subscribe, Joel Scalson thanks for spending close to two and a half
[03:28:18.900 --> 03:28:23.660]  hours with us, I'm going to give you a call a little bit later today about some research
[03:28:23.660 --> 03:28:27.260]  we're working on together, I really appreciate your insight and you're spending time with
[03:28:27.260 --> 03:28:28.260]  us.
[03:28:28.260 --> 03:28:31.300]  Likewise Alex, always a pleasure, God bless you.
[03:28:31.300 --> 03:28:33.860]  We're going to go to break here in a moment and come back with rebroadcast where I was
