[02:59.940 --> 03:04.940]  coming out and saying that's the scuttlebutt they're being told pass open

[03:52.220 --> 03:57.260]  driver over as illegal alien they are released into Valhalla not a citizen not
[03:57.260 --> 04:01.580]  a milk cow not a blood bag the vampire government sees citizens as blood bags
[04:01.580 --> 04:08.740]  and the open border illegal aliens as kind of Renfield servants of Nosferatu
[04:08.740 --> 04:13.220]  and this whole takedown of the Republic of course they will become blood bags as
[04:13.220 --> 04:17.900]  well as soon as they've helped do their job but their Renfield helpers who can
[04:17.900 --> 04:24.220]  come out during the day Obama may soon legalize millions of illegal aliens by
[04:24.220 --> 04:29.940]  executive dictate so we'll be covering what the hordes of Renfield servants are
[04:29.940 --> 04:36.700]  up to coming up also we're gonna get into the economy big poll confidence
[04:36.700 --> 04:42.620]  waning an Obama us outlook his polls just continue to fall like a shooting
[04:42.620 --> 04:49.060]  star into the Gulf of Mexico and we'll also get into the latest situation with
[04:49.060 --> 04:54.100]  Iran war right on the horizon with the provocation of the Iranian saying
[04:54.100 --> 04:57.820]  they're gonna run the Israeli Gaza but blockade and the Israelis seem gonna
[04:57.820 --> 05:05.500]  start boarding Iranian ships he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on
[05:05.500 --> 05:09.260]  the GCN radio network
[05:15.580 --> 05:20.620]  judge Andrew Napolitano coming up the next hour then rest of her mountain or
[05:20.620 --> 05:30.100]  Christopher Moncton Jack McClam your phone calls 1-800-259-9231
[05:32.980 --> 05:38.300]  okay let me just read to you from the top of the different stacks I have here
[05:38.300 --> 05:43.980]  in front of me today obviously you know obama fires McChrystal selects betray us
[05:43.980 --> 05:50.460]  to oversee opium fields in Afghanistan that's curtain emos headline at prison
[05:50.460 --> 05:56.780]  planet.com and info wars.com and it's now public in the last year in the BBC and
[05:56.780 --> 06:02.500]  Fox News and the Associated Press that yes our forces even help cultivate the
[06:02.500 --> 06:08.060]  opium because if they don't grow it and ship it out to America Al Qaeda will and
[06:08.060 --> 06:12.380]  they'll get the money so that's a great new spin that's how dumb the
[06:12.380 --> 06:18.660]  establishment thinks the public is that Al Qaeda isn't a CIA front that the
[06:18.660 --> 06:23.060]  Mujahideen wasn't created by Zabigniew Brzezinski in 79 to attack the Russians
[06:23.060 --> 06:31.380]  to elicit their invasion. It's all part of the record and so understand this is
[06:31.380 --> 06:36.300]  a very important article and that really is why we're there is to get control of
[06:36.300 --> 06:43.220]  those key pipeline regions for Unicol and others that's why we have Mohammed
[06:43.220 --> 06:51.300]  Karzai the former Unicol executive being the LFE quasi dictator of Afghanistan
[06:51.300 --> 06:55.060]  his brother on record the New York Times even admits this is the top narcotics
[06:55.060 --> 07:04.340]  trafficker in the nation works closely with NATO US and British forces and so
[07:04.340 --> 07:09.180]  now obama fires McChrystal selects betray us to oversee opium fields in
[07:09.180 --> 07:13.180]  Afghanistan I've done some research more research on McChrystal he was a
[07:13.180 --> 07:19.140]  special fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations before he was given a
[07:19.140 --> 07:23.820]  really high-level command when he was taken out of special forces and he is a
[07:23.820 --> 07:31.060]  globalist new world order all the way he was instrumental in the cover-up of the
[07:31.060 --> 07:37.420]  murder of Pat Tillman the big NFL star who was the poster boy for recruitment
[07:37.420 --> 07:43.180]  joining his brother in the army and being part of the Rangers and then
[07:43.180 --> 07:47.260]  riding home about the opium production and how the war was a fraud now he
[07:47.260 --> 07:52.020]  couldn't wait to get home and speak out against the war and black ops said that
[07:52.020 --> 07:55.180]  gets in the way of mission you are collateral damage and they claimed he'd
[07:55.180 --> 07:59.660]  fought al-Qaeda up a hill and valiantly defeated him turned out there wasn't any
[07:59.660 --> 08:03.860]  al-Qaeda or Taliban for you know hundreds of miles in any direction
[08:03.860 --> 08:08.300]  literally and that they'd gotten up close shot him up close he'd hid behind a
[08:08.300 --> 08:13.020]  rock and bagged and pleaded and even tried to get on a CB and they knew full
[08:13.020 --> 08:15.780]  well they they walked up claiming they were gonna give him aid and then shot
[08:15.780 --> 08:20.340]  him three times in the head at point blank range so he was murdered and we've
[08:20.340 --> 08:25.540]  talked to the family and they believe that and they're on record you know
[08:25.540 --> 08:28.980]  saying it's covered up so everybody's putting McChrystal up there like some
[08:28.980 --> 08:35.460]  big giant wondrous hero who was going to save our society and he wanted more
[08:35.460 --> 08:40.460]  troops and he wanted to win the mission and Obama just couldn't handle a real
[08:40.460 --> 08:47.620]  warrior and was uncomfortable with him in meetings they had
[08:48.220 --> 08:53.660]  McChrystal was chosen to play the hawkish end of the spectrum and call for
[08:53.660 --> 09:00.020]  60,000 troops so Obama could play the other end of the false choice and say
[09:00.020 --> 09:05.900]  only 30,000 now Obama had already sent 45,000 that there was literally no
[09:05.900 --> 09:10.380]  fanfare on that and then it was a false debate about so the left would be pro
[09:10.380 --> 09:14.860]  war well we're with Obama he only wants 30 and
[09:14.860 --> 09:21.220]  McChrystal wants 60,000 it's these theatrical events and two weeks ago they
[09:21.220 --> 09:25.140]  had the stunt about a trillion dollars in lithium that's in the country and of
[09:25.140 --> 09:29.500]  course that was in reports in the 80s that was in a World Bank report in 2003
[09:29.500 --> 09:34.900]  but it's that false idea of you're gonna get some of the Iraqi oil American
[09:34.900 --> 09:40.580]  people yeah you're gonna get some of the banker bailout money too right and you're
[09:40.580 --> 09:45.500]  going to get some of the lithium money I guess maybe they'll take the lithium and
[09:45.500 --> 09:48.580]  put it in your water that they've had studies to do that it's a toxic
[09:48.580 --> 09:51.300]  tranquilizer but other than that that's the only way you're getting any of the
[09:51.300 --> 09:58.300]  Afghan lithium is in your water so sit down and shut up so it's all just being
[09:58.300 --> 10:09.580]  it's all being sold and pushed perpetually as you as diversions to keep
[10:09.580 --> 10:14.220]  you that small dwindling number of people that support it to feel like you
[10:14.220 --> 10:18.260]  have some skin in the game and that you're part of the soap opera that is
[10:18.260 --> 10:24.700]  Afghanistan so Obama is horrible George W. Bush is horrible Mitt Romney is
[10:24.700 --> 10:27.100]  terrible
[10:28.100 --> 10:35.020]  McChrystal is horrible globalist CFR go read the CFR website I mean he is a
[10:35.020 --> 10:39.820]  senior fellow they took him out of special forces when he was a colonel
[10:39.820 --> 10:46.220]  sending to school there for several years and he is a CFR specialist a
[10:46.220 --> 10:53.260]  globalist a New World Order right now it is true that they love mr. PhD from the
[10:53.260 --> 10:59.540]  Woodrow Wilson New World Order to school a globalist school Betrayus general
[10:59.540 --> 11:04.140]  Betrayus who does have seizures in public hey but that didn't stop Julius
[11:04.140 --> 11:11.220]  Caesar from conquering the known world he is their little heir apparent and
[11:11.220 --> 11:16.620]  you've got to ask yourself why did McChrystal do what he did and he's not
[11:16.620 --> 11:26.780]  stupid in talking to a phony neoliberal trendy publication like Rolling Stone
[11:26.780 --> 11:35.340]  they knew exactly what they were doing his aid knew McChrystal knew and so he
[11:35.340 --> 11:41.660]  is a real warrior compared to the person having seizures who's never been in
[11:41.660 --> 11:46.500]  combat Betrayus of course the globalist don't like a fourth-generation West
[11:46.500 --> 11:50.420]  Pointer who was in the Delta Force previously and sleeps four hours a
[11:50.420 --> 11:54.460]  night and eats one meal a day and runs seven miles a day I mean they do not
[11:54.460 --> 11:59.420]  like that they would like to have Elena Kagan in a field marshal outfit with
[11:59.420 --> 12:04.740]  that giant jowl beneath her chin and then she can come up and undo a spicket on
[12:04.740 --> 12:08.740]  the bottom of it and pour pour cream gravy out on chicken fried steaks I
[12:08.740 --> 12:15.540]  mean that's their idea of a general is a pot-bellied woman who's about four
[12:15.540 --> 12:22.300]  foot nine with a jowl full of cream gravy and so yes they're uncomfortable and
[12:22.300 --> 12:26.740]  yes the aid and you know McChrystal talked about how uncomfortable Obama and
[12:26.740 --> 12:30.700]  these little mobster Chicago criminals are because they're not disciplined
[12:30.700 --> 12:35.420]  they're running around snorting cocaine partying you know
[12:35.420 --> 12:40.540]  carousing in Chicago getting their homes and cars and apartments paid for by
[12:40.540 --> 12:43.980]  BP and Goldman Sachs you know they're hanging out with Blagojevic they're a
[12:43.980 --> 12:48.580]  bunch of undisciplined teleprompter reading Harvard Crooks Harvard lawyers
[12:48.580 --> 12:53.100]  the same delicate geniuses that brought you derivatives so of course they hate
[12:53.100 --> 12:56.540]  someone who runs seven miles a day and sleeps four hours a night and runs
[12:56.540 --> 12:59.500]  around in the middle of the night stabbing and killing people in special
[12:59.500 --> 13:03.140]  forces I mean they don't like BB guns ladies and gentlemen they don't like
[13:03.140 --> 13:06.580]  rifles they don't like they're afraid of anything I've talked about
[13:06.580 --> 13:12.620]  domesticated female reporter here with Chris Matthews to interview me and she
[13:12.620 --> 13:16.900]  saw a firearm here in the in my studio in case anybody tries to bust in here and
[13:16.900 --> 13:21.860]  go postal on me we're not gonna just get down on our knees and beg no God helps
[13:21.860 --> 13:24.460]  those that helps themselves and the woman could started hyperventilating and
[13:24.460 --> 13:41.820]  crying and couldn't breathe literally this is the pre-programmed brainwashing
[13:41.820 --> 13:47.200]  that this is the imperial conditioning that they put minions of the
[13:47.200 --> 13:54.500]  dehumanization through so we don't know why McCrystal's gone he did a great job
[13:54.500 --> 13:59.100]  increasing opium production he did a great job angering the Pakistanis and
[13:59.100 --> 14:03.780]  Afghans to create an actual resistance so the Pentagon has a pretext for the
[14:03.780 --> 14:09.900]  fiat for the forever war the never-ending war you know that'll definitely go into
[14:09.900 --> 14:15.300]  several decades in Afghanistan a perfect system to dump trillions of
[14:15.300 --> 14:19.780]  armament sales into every decade hundreds of billions a year of oil and
[14:19.780 --> 14:23.780]  gas to be extracted 500 billion a year in opium I mean he was doing a pretty
[14:23.780 --> 14:32.900]  good job for him so maybe it is just thin-skinned you know Obama according to
[14:32.900 --> 14:40.820]  Wayne Madsen who I really trust Obama bathhouse Hussein Barry sitaro I mean it
[14:40.820 --> 14:46.860]  it just may be thin-skinned that they didn't like hearing some candid
[14:46.860 --> 14:50.900]  discussions about themselves but you've got to remember that it doesn't matter
[14:50.900 --> 15:02.580]  Betrayus is a globalist McCrystal the opium pimp is a globalist on record and even army
[15:02.580 --> 15:06.380]  coroners went public and said there was a cover-up and then all evidence showed
[15:06.380 --> 15:10.300]  foul play and murder I mean that's in the army report because there were army
[15:10.300 --> 15:18.460]  doctors who refused to go along with the falsification of General McCrystal and
[15:18.460 --> 15:23.380]  and he was in command he was the man who would have given the order to pull the
[15:23.380 --> 15:29.540]  trigger on Pat Tillman who'd gone from their dream poster boy to get all the
[15:29.540 --> 15:32.940]  young 18-year-olds out of high school to enlist for the meat grinder to
[15:32.940 --> 15:38.260]  somebody that was saying I'm not gonna grow smack I'm not gonna grow juice for
[15:38.260 --> 15:42.660]  people's veins I'm not gonna be part of this fake war I'm coming home he'd
[15:42.660 --> 15:47.420]  written letters to anti-war people to his family he was coming home and they
[15:47.420 --> 15:54.140]  said no you're not you're coming home in a pine box in my wings upon my chest
[15:54.140 --> 16:06.300]  tell my mom I done my best McCrystal ordered the whacking of the soldier tell
[16:06.300 --> 16:13.020]  my mom I done my best so I'm done talking about it it's a diversion the oil
[16:13.020 --> 16:17.400]  situation is horrible is devastating is obviously a false flag and he
[16:17.400 --> 16:22.260]  way you look at it they gave the orders to Anadarko and to Halliburton BP did
[16:22.260 --> 16:26.340]  that they knew would cause an eruption the engineers are on record who were
[16:26.340 --> 16:30.540]  took the orders and tried to refuse they had problems for two months the
[16:30.540 --> 16:35.220]  well had already ruptured that's all come out now we told you about it three
[16:35.220 --> 16:41.460]  weeks ago from the reports from the Coast Guard but the last week it's come
[16:41.460 --> 16:48.420]  out mainstream news Reuters BBC AP and yeah it's a big deal but it itself is a
[16:48.420 --> 16:52.260]  diversion from the Iran situation we'll give you the latest developments on
[16:52.260 --> 16:57.060]  that front when we return after this quick break I'm Alex Jones this is the
[16:57.060 --> 17:12.980]  GCN radio network GCN live.com
[17:12.980 --> 17:26.860]  welcome my friends coming up Judge Andrew Napolitano on a
[17:26.860 --> 17:31.740]  host of issues I'll be sure to bring this up with him Obama set to legalize
[17:31.740 --> 17:37.100]  millions of illegal aliens by executive dictate that's right stroke of the
[17:37.100 --> 17:42.540]  pen law the land kind of cool as Bogala said and this is what he's doing on the
[17:42.540 --> 17:47.700]  carbon taxes is what he's doing on the oil spill it's what he's doing on every
[17:47.700 --> 17:52.980]  front seizing the auto industry the bank situation so get ready for that will
[17:52.980 --> 18:02.980]  the prostrate to a Congress stand up to him that is coming up very very serious
[18:02.980 --> 18:07.740]  treason I mean that is treason if that isn't treason I don't know what is now
[18:07.740 --> 18:11.220]  you know the former head of massage calling for a strike on Iran you know
[18:11.220 --> 18:16.380]  that Benjamin Netanyahu the Israeli prime minister is calling for it so
[18:16.380 --> 18:22.620]  they're going to intensify the blockade of Gaza and that if anyone tries to get
[18:22.620 --> 18:26.940]  through it they're going to get rougher with them they're going to intensify
[18:26.940 --> 18:34.580]  their response they were too easy too lenient a month ago or so and continuing
[18:34.580 --> 18:39.140]  with that Iran of course is officially going to send a blockade busting ship to
[18:39.140 --> 18:46.620]  Gaza they say it is a set to leave today other ships left yesterday this is a
[18:46.620 --> 18:52.220]  whole bunch of other ships from Scotland and Ireland and France and Spain
[18:52.220 --> 19:02.620]  and Morocco and Iran all steaming all deciling all sailing towards the coast
[19:02.620 --> 19:07.900]  Iran said it would send a blockade busting ship carrying aid and pro-Palestinian
[19:07.900 --> 19:11.860]  activists to Gaza feeling concerned in Israel were commandos were training for
[19:11.860 --> 19:17.300]  another possible confrontation at sea and then if the Iranians fire on them
[19:17.300 --> 19:22.140]  it's the Israelis will sink the ship and it will be a giant international issue
[19:22.140 --> 19:27.700]  perfect springboard and Israel has three German-made dolphin subs with nuclear
[19:27.700 --> 19:34.860]  tip cruise missiles in the Persian Gulf openly this is going back two weeks ago
[19:34.860 --> 19:37.940]  in the times of London and herettes and Jerusalem post saying they may
[19:37.940 --> 19:42.900]  preemptively nuke any day and the Israeli Air Force is training for bombing
[19:42.900 --> 19:47.140]  raids on hundreds of military sites anything that could support the program
[19:47.140 --> 19:53.260]  the nuclear program whether you believe it's peaceful or not power plants water
[19:53.260 --> 19:59.940]  treatment plants roads naval forces military forces army forces militia
[19:59.940 --> 20:03.460]  forces and of course two years ago the US battle plan was released by the
[20:03.460 --> 20:08.180]  Pentagon including nuclear-tipped bunker busters they said well don't worry this
[20:08.180 --> 20:13.500]  isn't your granddaddy's nukes dropped on Hiroshima Nakasaki a bombs this isn't
[20:13.500 --> 20:19.500]  your uncle's hydrogen bombs this is modern smaller low yield but of course
[20:19.500 --> 20:23.620]  they do release giant plumes of radioactive waste ejected into the
[20:23.620 --> 20:28.380]  atmosphere and then raining back down to the jet stream across the world and if
[20:28.380 --> 20:37.380]  you live anywhere in California Nevada Arizona New Mexico Texas if you look at
[20:37.380 --> 20:41.060]  the jet streams that come out of the Middle East and they go around the
[20:41.060 --> 20:46.460]  world what what happens in Iran and Iraq dumps directly in generally the jet
[20:46.460 --> 20:50.380]  stream varies from day-to-day but but generally dumps in right over New
[20:50.380 --> 20:56.980]  Mexico and Texas the toxic waste coming out of China all of their dirty
[20:56.980 --> 21:02.020]  factories that have zero emissions controls rain down mainly in Texas it's
[21:02.020 --> 21:06.620]  interesting look at the jet stream that that goes right across the Europe Western
[21:06.620 --> 21:12.140]  Europe Central Europe Eastern Europe into the Middle East and then into
[21:12.140 --> 21:20.540]  Central Asia across China goes then right across the ocean blue the Pacific
[21:20.540 --> 21:26.580]  and then rains down on us isn't that nice so all of you good ol boys out there
[21:26.580 --> 21:33.220]  that are saying nuke nuke nuke green glass parking lot kill kill kill kill kill me
[21:33.220 --> 21:39.980]  some our rainers our rainier's Iranians well you're going to get what you want
[21:39.980 --> 21:45.660]  then you're you and your family will get to breathe all of the deadly fallout
[21:45.660 --> 21:51.380]  that will go up into the atmosphere at 30,000 feet and then come lovingly down
[21:51.380 --> 21:58.060]  into your cities hmm a lot of people think there's so many allergies in
[21:58.060 --> 22:04.780]  central Texas because of all of the plant and floral life around here we're
[22:04.780 --> 22:08.700]  supposed to the capital but of allergies but really that's exacerbated and
[22:08.700 --> 22:13.660]  causing many doctors believe analogous believe by the fact that the toxic trade
[22:13.660 --> 22:20.820]  wins come from all over I mean there's a bunch of different layers of bands around
[22:20.820 --> 22:28.420]  the globe of of the jet streams but the particular jet stream that goes right
[22:28.420 --> 22:32.420]  across some of those toxic areas in the world range down right on me where why
[22:32.420 --> 22:38.100]  do I live here why do I let my family breathe this I don't have moved to
[22:38.100 --> 22:43.500]  Montana maybe I will move the entire operation of Montana
[22:43.500 --> 22:46.940]  we'll be right back stay where this ladies and gentlemen your phone calls
[22:46.940 --> 23:04.300]  are straight ahead get up stand up stand up for your right
[23:04.300 --> 23:20.680]  all right let me get some more of the top news we'll be going back into in more
[23:20.680 --> 23:23.860]  detail throughout the day when Lord Moncton joins us judge Andrew and
[23:23.860 --> 23:31.600]  Paul Otano officer Jack McClam and others you know about maple wood or may
[23:31.600 --> 23:35.460]  wood to lay off all city employees dismantled police department that's
[23:35.460 --> 23:40.500]  out of the LA Times but all over the country hundreds and hundreds of
[23:40.500 --> 23:45.220]  counties and cities are laying off half of their police or more they're
[23:45.220 --> 23:49.460]  announcing they're not going to fix roads or sidewalks anymore but they're
[23:49.460 --> 23:53.940]  going to raise taxes what's wrong with this picture how did the cities get in
[23:53.940 --> 23:58.820]  a financial situation where now your taxes go up but then you don't get any
[23:58.820 --> 24:05.900]  of the government services because the cities were sold derivatives by the
[24:05.900 --> 24:09.940]  central banks who are now making record profits this is a financial takeover
[24:09.940 --> 24:15.140]  they are treacherous larceness criminals and in so many cases you now see
[24:15.140 --> 24:20.900]  sheriffs and mayors saying buy guns arm yourselves in Ohio and other states
[24:20.900 --> 24:27.180]  because in one city they have a hundred and forty plus sheriff's deputies in one
[24:27.180 --> 24:31.540]  county and they were cutting them down to 44 and of those 44 most were
[24:31.540 --> 24:40.940]  administrative or at the jail and three were designated as the shift one
[24:40.940 --> 24:47.340]  deputy per shift in the entire county all the rest for bureaucracy all the
[24:47.340 --> 24:52.420]  rest for government compliance all the rest to write tickets and suck off you
[24:52.420 --> 24:58.660]  zero service and at least the sheriff in that town said you better buy guns we
[24:58.660 --> 25:04.260]  are not allowed to help you we're only allowed to feed and the bankers have done
[25:04.260 --> 25:07.900]  this to hundreds of third world nations that's why their third world the
[25:07.900 --> 25:13.420]  bankers don't want you having an engine of financial stability and
[25:13.420 --> 25:18.300]  independence they want to control you and the business insider reports
[25:18.300 --> 25:23.780]  doigt's bank u.s. financial conditions just collapsed back to crisis levels
[25:23.780 --> 25:28.700]  financial conditions appear to have worsened substantially in recent
[25:28.700 --> 25:33.100]  quarters based on our update of the broad index of us financial variables
[25:33.100 --> 25:36.980]  presented earlier this year by the u.s. monetary policy forum in the wake of our
[25:36.980 --> 25:40.860]  recent developments in Europe increased stress in financial markets has pushed
[25:40.860 --> 25:46.620]  that index halfway back to its immediate post Lehman crisis lows that's how to
[25:46.620 --> 25:54.820]  doigt's bank Peter hoppers comments biggest bank in Germany and they go
[25:54.820 --> 25:59.260]  through the 25 financial institutions most likely to default and it all will
[25:59.260 --> 26:05.020]  be consolidated down to one or two mega central banks Goldman Sachs JPMorgan
[26:05.020 --> 26:08.940]  Chase which of course on the stock in the Federal Reserve Bank of England the
[26:08.940 --> 26:14.820]  German central bank the European Union central bank and they finance all the
[26:14.820 --> 26:20.700]  fake green economy behavior they finance all the new carbon taxes you
[26:20.700 --> 26:28.460]  notice that Australia got a new leader yesterday and she swore the last guy got
[26:28.460 --> 26:31.460]  thrown out because of his carbon tax and they admitted on the news that the
[26:31.460 --> 26:35.860]  cattle farmers and sheep farmers would not be allowed to use the land anymore
[26:35.860 --> 26:40.380]  in over half the country remember those newscasts we played where the newscasts
[26:40.380 --> 26:46.300]  were saying it was good they said yes generations of farmers lived on this
[26:46.300 --> 26:49.340]  land but they're no longer allowed to use it because all of this area is off
[26:49.340 --> 26:54.820]  limits because of the carbon footprint of cows and sheep's flatulence this is
[26:54.820 --> 27:05.060]  siege shutting down society and she swears she swears that she will ram it
[27:05.060 --> 27:14.420]  through you know on a separate issue I don't like to just get up here and bash
[27:14.420 --> 27:19.980]  police because if we just do that cops that are good and aren't going along with
[27:19.980 --> 27:27.980]  the police state thuggish goonish directives they're being given then
[27:27.980 --> 27:33.380]  psychologically feel alienated from the population of the country and so tend to
[27:33.380 --> 27:39.820]  gravitate into the gang psychosis that many police are under and that the
[27:39.820 --> 27:53.380]  system coaxes them to join but every day without looking I see mainstream media
[27:53.380 --> 28:00.180]  video this one out of a New York courthouse of the cops beating up a
[28:00.180 --> 28:04.940]  quote army veteran of iraq they always had that because they don't know what to
[28:04.940 --> 28:08.740]  do it's like worship the police worship the military of course when you're
[28:08.740 --> 28:11.540]  actually in trouble as a copper in the form of a member of the military they're
[28:11.540 --> 28:14.700]  not going to help you the system isn't but they point out that the cop beats
[28:14.700 --> 28:20.260]  him in the head of the billy club for literally no reason and then charges him
[28:20.260 --> 28:27.420]  the video is up on info wars.com charges him with attacking the cop and then the
[28:27.420 --> 28:32.060]  cop lied and filed fake police reports other cops filed it with them but
[28:32.060 --> 28:39.300]  strangely the New York courthouse actually released the video and told the
[28:39.300 --> 28:45.060]  truth so I guess that's good I mean but but I've seen this over and over again
[28:45.060 --> 28:52.540]  I've had cops arrest me and then lie and talk about falsely charging me in front
[28:52.540 --> 28:58.100]  of me laughing at me but they're not doing it probably because I told them
[28:58.100 --> 29:04.700]  very calmly okay I'm gonna sue you you're not gonna get away with this I
[29:04.700 --> 29:09.100]  mean I guess because I'm a media person they they think twice but they get some
[29:09.100 --> 29:13.780]  average schmo out there I want more and more of them I mean it is standard
[29:13.780 --> 29:20.540]  procedure for police to frame folks I mean they'll even do it when they know
[29:20.540 --> 29:25.300]  there's a camera rolling now and that's a scary thing and it undermines the
[29:25.300 --> 29:29.340]  entire history of police in this country and it does create an us against them
[29:29.340 --> 29:33.980]  mentality and police need to speak out against this and this needs to be
[29:33.980 --> 29:39.860]  ostracized this type of behavior needs to be completely off limits but instead
[29:39.860 --> 29:43.900]  how many squad car videos have you seen or audio have you heard where the cops
[29:43.900 --> 29:49.420]  are so comfortable in their fraud that they they on the tape talk about how
[29:49.420 --> 29:52.780]  they're gonna frame somebody where they'll run into a woman or run into a
[29:52.780 --> 29:59.260]  man and run into somebody on the bike okay this guy's dead we're gonna say he
[29:59.260 --> 30:03.940]  pulled out in front of me okay or oh I just ran into the back of this lady I'm
[30:03.940 --> 30:08.020]  gonna go ahead and arrest her for DWI now she didn't drink in but we're gonna
[30:08.020 --> 30:13.940]  say she is all right okay and the argument is you know you're on the cop
[30:13.940 --> 30:17.740]  side or you're on the you know the cops are outgunned and everybody's out to get
[30:17.740 --> 30:21.820]  us this is what they say internally so we've got to go ahead and cut some
[30:21.820 --> 30:29.460]  corners well that's how you become Nazi Germany and yeah police have a tough
[30:29.460 --> 30:32.860]  job I certainly wouldn't want it but you mean you can't just stop start framing
[30:32.860 --> 30:37.820]  people so I'd like you to go watch the video up on info wars calm it's New
[30:37.820 --> 30:44.580]  York City cop beats war veterans senseless the headline should be cop
[30:44.580 --> 30:50.540]  caught framing man he beats because on the local newscast they admit and the
[30:50.540 --> 30:55.740]  police are now charging the cop the grand jury is that they he beats the guy
[30:55.740 --> 30:59.700]  up for no reason hitting them in the head with a billy club over and over the
[30:59.700 --> 31:04.340]  and over again in fact let's just play the news clip because I forget how many
[31:04.340 --> 31:07.580]  times they say he hit him let's go ahead and play this news clip and I'm gonna go
[31:07.580 --> 31:13.460]  to your phone calls it's just what do we do about this as a society here it is
[31:13.460 --> 31:17.780]  confrontation plays out while security cameras roll a police officer repeatedly
[31:17.780 --> 31:21.940]  hits a man with his baton the class reportedly happened after Iraq war
[31:21.940 --> 31:25.900]  veteran Walter Harvan ignored police officer David London's request for an
[31:25.900 --> 31:31.580]  ID tempers flare after Harvan pushes London the video shows London repeatedly
[31:31.580 --> 31:36.140]  hitting Harvan ultimately delivering nearly 20 blows the videotape was shown
[31:36.140 --> 31:40.620]  Friday at the start of London's criminal trial the incident happened in 2008
[31:40.620 --> 31:45.780]  Harvan has found a $35 million federal civil rights suit against London and the
[31:45.780 --> 31:49.860]  New York Police Department London is also accused of lying about the beating
[31:49.860 --> 31:53.980]  prosecutors say he submitted reports saying Harvan had repeatedly kicked and
[31:53.980 --> 32:00.300]  punched the officers however the videotape tells a different story yeah
[32:00.300 --> 32:06.180]  all the black iran war vet does is the cop starts jumping on him and grabbing
[32:06.180 --> 32:09.740]  by the shoulders in the arms and the guy literally just pulls his hands away
[32:09.740 --> 32:16.180]  which is an instinct to do and it's like the police go good I've got a reason to
[32:16.180 --> 32:20.660]  beat this guy in the head with a baton I mean you can kill people punching them
[32:20.660 --> 32:24.580]  folks what is it with cops just especially New York cops you've seen the
[32:24.580 --> 32:29.300]  footage of them beating the guy for like five minutes in the legs bloody just
[32:29.300 --> 32:35.100]  for fun beating him and beating him and beating him and beating him and beating
[32:35.100 --> 32:39.860]  him and beating him I mean ladies and gentlemen I mean if somebody really
[32:39.860 --> 32:43.100]  hits you in the head harm of the billy club one time there's a good chance it's
[32:43.100 --> 32:47.580]  gonna kill you and you see these cops hauling off with all the force they got
[32:47.580 --> 32:52.940]  but it is usually wimp cops I mean it usually is little scrawny or potbelly
[32:52.940 --> 32:57.220]  cops who do this and I guess they just get scared hey if you're scared of
[32:57.220 --> 33:00.820]  everything and want to beat somebody with a billy club because they talk back to
[33:00.820 --> 33:04.060]  you shouldn't be a cop I mean you really they really shouldn't be hiring all
[33:04.060 --> 33:07.340]  these wimps because most the time when they when you see somebody shot in the
[33:07.340 --> 33:11.540]  back by a cop where you see a cop beating somebody to death or half to death
[33:11.540 --> 33:15.340]  it's some weakling and look I'm not here against you know people who aren't
[33:15.340 --> 33:21.340]  strong but I mean don't be a cop okay I mean if you're just scared to death so
[33:21.340 --> 33:26.260]  scared you're gonna beat people for no reason and shoot them because you got
[33:26.260 --> 33:33.380]  something to prove we do not need people with Napoleonic complexes as police who
[33:33.380 --> 33:41.420]  got something to prove all right I'm done talking about it
[33:41.420 --> 33:48.340]  oh let's go to your phone calls let's talk to Annie in Oregon Annie you're on
[33:48.340 --> 33:53.220]  the air thanks for holding hi Alex I'm just very sorry to say that we only
[33:53.220 --> 33:57.820]  found you two months ago but very glad that we finally found you and we're
[33:57.820 --> 34:02.060]  busy listening to your archive shows I'm glad that you're having Jesse Ventura on
[34:02.060 --> 34:06.420]  tomorrow and as you know I'm sure you are aware of that Jesse's conspiracy
[34:06.420 --> 34:11.420]  theory show just kind of suddenly disappeared after True TV had some major
[34:11.420 --> 34:16.260]  advertising campaigns promoting it and I called True TV back in I think March or
[34:16.260 --> 34:19.700]  April and I asked what happened to the show and I received a very unusual
[34:19.700 --> 34:25.260]  response from the gal and the gal started whispering on the phone she
[34:25.260 --> 34:28.700]  whispered and she says do you want me to tell you what we're supposed to tell
[34:28.700 --> 34:32.820]  everyone or do you want me to tell you what we've been told and I said well how
[34:32.820 --> 34:38.100]  about both so in a whisper she says that well we're supposed to tell everyone
[34:38.100 --> 34:42.980]  that calls that his season is over and I said oh only after five episodes and
[34:42.980 --> 34:47.580]  she says yeah but she says actually it's been pulled we can't show it on reruns
[34:47.580 --> 34:51.220]  it's been pulled from the internet and she says we've all been laid off and
[34:51.220 --> 34:54.620]  we're going to be gone within 30 days well I
[34:54.620 --> 35:00.460]  know ma'am listen I it's good to have you here as a new listener but you may
[35:00.460 --> 35:05.820]  have missed the show and also there's a lot of rumors that go around in big
[35:05.820 --> 35:12.340]  organizations and people answering the phone I'm surprised you could get
[35:12.340 --> 35:17.180]  somebody at a major network on the phone they have hundreds of different
[35:17.180 --> 35:22.700]  programs you know dozens and dozens of shows I would guess 40 50 different
[35:22.700 --> 35:30.220]  shows maybe a hundred other shows they're doing in reruns and the way
[35:30.220 --> 35:35.100]  television works and by the way the lady that told you that if she did is
[35:35.100 --> 35:44.580]  mistaken is that you have production houses that make TV shows okay for
[35:44.580 --> 35:51.500]  television and then it and then it gets picked up now Jesse Ventura show and he
[35:51.500 --> 35:55.740]  was on a few months ago to announce it here has been picked up for another eight
[35:55.740 --> 36:02.820]  part season it wasn't five parts it was eight parts and it got record ratings
[36:02.820 --> 36:06.620]  on the true network the highest ratings of any new show they've ever had formerly
[36:06.620 --> 36:12.620]  court TV and it's the number one reality TV network there's four or five of them
[36:12.620 --> 36:19.420]  out there and Ventura show got record ratings it got roughly four times the
[36:19.420 --> 36:25.220]  viewers of say Chris Matthews and if you come it together in the aggregate more
[36:25.220 --> 36:32.700]  than 20 million people watched each episode around 1.8 to 1.9 watched it as
[36:32.700 --> 36:38.020]  it premiered and then each show aired more than 20 times again and Aaron was
[36:38.020 --> 36:46.540]  just telling me he saw it about a month ago in replace so people will also
[36:46.540 --> 36:51.820]  operators at places will also get real smart mouth with people and and make
[36:51.820 --> 36:57.260]  stuff up so but you know I'll ask Jesse about the show tomorrow but you see I'm
[36:57.260 --> 37:02.380]  a consultant on the show and I don't know everything about it and you know I
[37:02.380 --> 37:06.500]  just simply answer questions or they they run people by me and I give them my
[37:06.500 --> 37:13.660]  feedback on them I mean that's basically it and I'm really not supposed to you
[37:13.660 --> 37:19.820]  know talk much more about the show as a consultant on it and also someone who
[37:19.820 --> 37:26.140]  appears on it but but no the show is in full production with a somewhat larger
[37:26.140 --> 37:32.580]  budget not a lot bigger and it is one of their top shows and the president of the
[37:32.580 --> 37:41.060]  network is extremely excited about it and that's all I'm gonna say and see I
[37:41.060 --> 37:45.500]  take a phone call and that just completely threw me for a loop because
[37:45.500 --> 37:53.220]  well Ventura didn't expect the last eight episodes to air because you know
[37:53.220 --> 37:56.380]  in every case he comes out and discovers global warming is a complete fraud and
[37:56.380 --> 38:03.340]  criminal operation for eugenics or he finds out that harp is a weapon and the
[38:03.340 --> 38:07.260]  show is extremely popular and nothing like this has ever been allowed to air
[38:07.260 --> 38:14.260]  on television but the system is struggling to stay in the game to stay
[38:14.260 --> 38:20.060]  relevant I mean that's why Chris Matthews and MSNBC all they talk about
[38:20.060 --> 38:23.580]  more than half their programming is bashing tea partiers and conspiracy
[38:23.580 --> 38:28.140]  theorist and anti-new order people I chief amongst them I mean just they're
[38:28.140 --> 38:32.820]  talking about me every day now in MSNBC because they're scared they know my
[38:32.820 --> 38:36.580]  info is powerful they know we have more listeners and viewers on the web than
[38:36.580 --> 38:40.340]  all of MSNBC combined go look at the numbers they are a paper tiger it's a
[38:40.340 --> 38:44.860]  joke Rush Limbaugh's got 22 million listeners conservatively that's on
[38:44.860 --> 38:48.740]  rated stations that are in Arbitron he's got a lot of affiliates that don't
[38:48.740 --> 38:54.420]  subscribe to the book so it's not counted his internet and other media
[38:54.420 --> 38:58.980]  aggregates show about two million internet listeners a week so that's 24
[38:58.980 --> 39:07.020]  million Sean Hannity 12 million George Norrie 16 million Michael Savage 12
[39:07.020 --> 39:14.180]  million this show conservatively 2 million on rated MNFM stations that's a
[39:14.180 --> 39:19.220]  conservative it's more like five okay but let's just say two okay another
[39:19.220 --> 39:24.620]  million and a half to 2 million on the internet exponentially growing every
[39:24.620 --> 39:31.740]  week listening I mean Chris Matthews is a joke his top shows at 500,000 it's a
[39:31.740 --> 39:38.140]  joke but see they put on these big airs and they sit there with fancy
[39:38.140 --> 39:42.380]  teleprompters and fancy sets and and and have all these big star-studded
[39:42.380 --> 39:49.340]  guests it's all a joke having a Nobel Prize is a joke it I mean it's like
[39:49.340 --> 39:52.740]  almost like being a convicted child molester now you've got Al Gore this
[39:52.740 --> 39:57.860]  liar caught lying in climategate you've got the war criminal Henry Kissinger
[39:57.860 --> 40:03.660]  with one and having a show on MSNBC is like having a syndicated show on five
[40:03.660 --> 40:09.300]  radio stations see with talk radio you may have three or four choices in a big
[40:09.300 --> 40:13.420]  city one or two in a small town and there's only three or four networks so
[40:13.420 --> 40:18.340]  you've got an audience for talk radio of conservatively a hundred million
[40:18.340 --> 40:23.220]  Americans divided between four or five networks we're the smallest of the five
[40:23.220 --> 40:28.380]  see that's conservative dividing up a hundred million listeners then you've
[40:28.380 --> 40:38.260]  got cable with 500 plus channels it's a joke it's a mirage it's a hoax okay
[40:38.260 --> 40:48.060]  Annie I appreciate your call but that person if you did talk to him told you a
[40:48.060 --> 40:52.300]  load of feathers poppy-duck
[40:52.300 --> 41:08.540]  I don't know if they want me to mention the name of their publication but it's
[41:08.540 --> 41:13.340]  one of the most popular in England magazines it's the equivalent of the
[41:13.340 --> 41:21.340]  British Maxim and I walk out during the three-minute break and boy I tell you
[41:21.340 --> 41:24.780]  that music is fitting I didn't intend to play that Bob Marley song where he's
[41:24.780 --> 41:28.660]  talking about the Babylon system is the vampire sucking the blood of the
[41:28.660 --> 41:32.820]  children dry and I walk out and they've got up on the computer screen along in
[41:32.820 --> 41:37.300]  telegraph headline big money to be made in the adoption trade and they said do
[41:37.300 --> 41:42.260]  you know about this this writer and I said no and he said well do you know
[41:42.260 --> 41:46.220]  about them allotting babies before they're even born for CPS to take them
[41:46.220 --> 41:50.060]  and and and I said well yes I've had members of the British Parliament on that
[41:50.060 --> 41:57.580]  goes on here but you know here are mainstream writers and the photographer
[41:57.580 --> 42:01.900]  you know saying that they're having their awakening right now I mean look
[42:01.900 --> 42:07.540]  when my dad who's a physician told me when I was 15 don't sign the organ donor
[42:07.540 --> 42:11.860]  card the word is some some hospitals will kill you if you come in from a car
[42:11.860 --> 42:14.980]  wreck and are viable because they're gonna get your organs and I rolled my
[42:14.980 --> 42:18.620]  eyes and didn't believe him and then a decade later or so there was a big
[42:18.620 --> 42:22.100]  national news story about him literally not giving people treatment to get their
[42:22.100 --> 42:28.060]  organs and their eyes and their blood to literally a sanguiate suck them dry
[42:28.060 --> 42:32.620]  there are criminal guilds operating everywhere and they do it through
[42:32.620 --> 42:40.620]  government and corporate deniability you know through these I mean it's kind of
[42:40.620 --> 42:43.540]  like Goldman Sachs and other selling derivatives but then having their
[42:43.540 --> 42:49.340]  subsidiary insurance company certify it is good and so they just legitimize this
[42:49.340 --> 42:55.740]  whole thing and like with like these groups of criminals mashed together but
[42:55.740 --> 43:01.620]  I was just reading this article in the last minute about a young lady has a
[43:01.620 --> 43:06.620]  child and was horrified to receive a letter that told her before she was
[43:06.620 --> 43:14.020]  even gonna have the child that they were gonna take the baby and then they
[43:14.020 --> 43:18.580]  should and then it comes out internal documents that they just have quotas well
[43:18.580 --> 43:22.060]  remember the state senator up in Georgia who we had on who was about to
[43:22.060 --> 43:26.700]  release all the documents about how they actually have headhunting quotas for
[43:26.700 --> 43:31.060]  even five six seven eight-year-old blonde-haired blue-eyed girls green-eyed
[43:31.060 --> 43:34.700]  dark hair oh you there could be six hundred grand for those and they're in
[43:34.700 --> 43:38.780]  the schools and they've got their operators who get kickbacks the
[43:38.780 --> 43:42.060]  principals the nurses and they'll call your little first-grade daughter in and
[43:42.060 --> 43:45.260]  they'll they'll look on her knees and if she's got a scuff from running in the
[43:45.260 --> 43:52.100]  playground she will be grabbed by the CPS network and will be delivered to the
[43:52.100 --> 43:56.340]  pedophile people that want her one within just a few weeks that's how they
[43:56.340 --> 44:00.620]  were meaning it's all real the pedophiles like go to the grocery store and
[44:00.620 --> 44:04.500]  it's like we're tomatoes or potatoes they just get us off the shelf and they
[44:04.500 --> 44:10.140]  send men in uniforms to get us off the shelf for them we are nothing but meat
[44:10.140 --> 44:14.740]  to them we're nothing but animals where we're fed on and they can and and it's
[44:14.740 --> 44:18.140]  just like young women would get in the car with Ted Bundy over and over again
[44:18.140 --> 44:21.340]  he was driving a nice cute little Volkswagen non-threatening he picked
[44:21.340 --> 44:24.580]  it because it was yellow he was wearing a little suit he would act real
[44:24.580 --> 44:27.460]  friendly to him and they couldn't believe five hours later they were in a
[44:27.460 --> 44:30.460]  shack with him electrocuting and biting bloody chunks out of him and
[44:30.460 --> 44:34.260]  torturing him because he had a short haircut and was well spoken and going to
[44:34.260 --> 44:39.980]  law school and you know he'd torture him for a few hours and kill him and it's
[44:39.980 --> 44:42.860]  the same thing I mean you know the government grows the opium in Afghanistan
[44:42.860 --> 44:46.420]  dying core Halliburton are on record running giant child kidnapping rings
[44:46.420 --> 44:50.100]  even comes out the Chicago Tribune no one stops them everywhere the UN goes
[44:50.100 --> 44:54.140]  they're caught running giant child kidnapping rings snuff films production
[44:54.140 --> 45:00.860]  opium cocaine shipments just total evil and so when the guys asked me during the
[45:00.860 --> 45:06.100]  break they said you know about this yes I know all about it and you know it's
[45:06.100 --> 45:10.500]  taking me a lot to be able to face up just how evil all this is but the longer
[45:10.500 --> 45:14.580]  we're naive the worse it's gonna get it's kind of like Jews and others that
[45:14.580 --> 45:17.980]  were able to flee Germany the few that could who would tell people look they
[45:17.980 --> 45:21.020]  got labor camps they're working people to death they're killing people they're
[45:21.020 --> 45:24.740]  shooting them in pits people said all Hitler's not doing that shut up
[45:24.740 --> 45:29.180]  conspiracy theorist oh yeah people that said there were La Cosa Nostra until 54
[45:29.180 --> 45:40.040]  we're called conspiracy theorist big brother mainstream media government
[45:40.040 --> 45:47.660]  cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio
[45:47.660 --> 45:55.100]  network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones well we're into hour number
[45:55.100 --> 45:59.860]  two he's with us for 30 minutes running us from the Fox business studios he has
[45:59.860 --> 46:05.700]  the number one show on Fox business with its premiere the number one show
[46:05.700 --> 46:10.620]  because he's the hardest-hitting contributor on Fox television he's the
[46:10.620 --> 46:16.100]  one guy that I can agree with 99% of the time I don't agree with myself hardly
[46:16.100 --> 46:19.060]  99% of the time I'll I'll tune into something I said a week ago and kind of
[46:19.060 --> 46:23.180]  go I didn't mean the way that sounded but Judge Andrew Napolitano is just
[46:23.180 --> 46:27.980]  amazing multi-time best-selling author former federal judge constitutional
[46:27.980 --> 46:32.060]  lawyer he's with us for 30 minutes to talk about Elena Kagan the more we
[46:32.060 --> 46:35.300]  learn about her openly anti-gun she praises what Robert Bork called the
[46:35.300 --> 46:38.820]  worst judge in the world this Israeli judge who calls for judges to be
[46:38.820 --> 46:42.900]  activist to restrict free speech she calls for restricting free speech
[46:42.900 --> 46:48.820]  Obama using executive orders to try to ram through carbon taxes and on the
[46:48.820 --> 46:52.820]  coal plants now he wants to do it we've got eight senators telling us that's in
[46:52.820 --> 46:56.860]  Fox News and Reuters and other publications that he may use an executive
[46:56.860 --> 47:01.860]  order to legalize all the illegals which is pretty unconstitutional so we're
[47:01.860 --> 47:05.540]  going to talk about it all with Judge Andrew Napolitano judge good to have
[47:05.540 --> 47:08.740]  you here with us pleasure to be here Alex thank you for the kind things you
[47:08.740 --> 47:13.460]  said you actually promoted me I'm a former life tenured state judge judge
[47:13.460 --> 47:18.700]  how about a grand UN judge they you know Kagan Kagan would like to have us under
[47:18.700 --> 47:23.020]  UN control she said so you know it's frightening to hear that she has said
[47:23.020 --> 47:27.460]  those things and one can only hope that they were the musings of a young lawyer
[47:27.460 --> 47:32.020]  because if she still holds those ideas that we should have judges like they
[47:32.020 --> 47:37.700]  do in Europe who can outlaw certain types of speech and compel compel certain
[47:37.700 --> 47:41.500]  types of economic activities that authority comes nowhere from the
[47:41.500 --> 47:45.460]  Constitution you and I have criticized George Bush who claimed that he got
[47:45.460 --> 47:48.500]  authority as president from some source he wouldn't say what the source was
[47:48.500 --> 47:52.420]  other than the Constitution it was absurd and almost every time he claimed
[47:52.420 --> 47:57.180]  that the court itself knocked him down now we have a would-be and probably will
[47:57.180 --> 48:01.300]  be member of the court who was claiming that the court has authority from some
[48:01.300 --> 48:05.140]  source other than the Constitution and that they should use it according to
[48:05.140 --> 48:11.540]  their political predilections this and this alone is enough to to block her
[48:11.540 --> 48:16.460]  from being confirmed but the Democrats have 59 senators I'm sure she'll get in
[48:16.460 --> 48:21.460]  no matter what she said well what about the quote from her 93 law review where
[48:21.460 --> 48:26.940]  she publicly wrote that if we don't like speech we will quote disappear it and
[48:26.940 --> 48:31.380]  now Obama openly announces the internet electronic kill switch under
[48:31.380 --> 48:36.620]  cybersecurity the FCC proposes black boxes in our homes that filter what we
[48:36.620 --> 48:41.740]  can see and that tracks everything we're doing I mean you talk about the bottom
[48:41.740 --> 48:44.580]  falling out that you've always warned about as a constitutional law scholar
[48:44.580 --> 48:49.740]  that once you go over that threshold that there's nothing there underpinning
[48:49.740 --> 48:54.820]  it historically we always accelerate into tyranny what's your take on her
[48:54.820 --> 48:59.380]  confirmation and will she get confirmed we've seen national polls of less than
[48:59.380 --> 49:05.620]  38% support her and and what do you say about Obama's move to openly take over
[49:05.620 --> 49:09.620]  the internet all right a couple things first of all the concept of a box in the
[49:09.620 --> 49:16.620]  house rings of the Chinese government and rings of George Orwell's 1984 and it
[49:16.620 --> 49:20.860]  is inconceivable that that could be constitutional under the law because the
[49:20.860 --> 49:25.820]  the threshold of your house makes you the the king of your castle and if the
[49:25.820 --> 49:30.100]  Constitution is going to be followed the government can't enter directly
[49:30.100 --> 49:34.540]  physically or constructively without a search warrant from a judge that's the
[49:34.540 --> 49:38.060]  law I don't know that she would uphold it that way but I believe that the
[49:38.060 --> 49:42.300]  majority of the Supreme Court will secondly regrettably unfortunately I
[49:42.300 --> 49:46.500]  believe that she will be conferred simply confirmed simply because she is the
[49:46.500 --> 49:52.140]  nominee of a of a Democratic president and the Democrats have 59 votes in the
[49:52.140 --> 49:57.660]  Senate they don't care what she says she will of course tickle their ivories when
[49:57.660 --> 50:02.780]  she says progressive things that's with an uppercase T and progressive like you
[50:02.780 --> 50:07.460]  have just quoted her as having said because the Democrats don't believe in
[50:07.460 --> 50:10.340]  freedom and many Republicans are in the same boat the big government crowd
[50:10.340 --> 50:16.020]  doesn't believe in freedom they believe in power and in conformity let's get
[50:16.020 --> 50:19.340]  back into that when we return and I want to talk more about your TV show
[50:19.340 --> 50:24.340]  because this is so important I mean Liberty is what is most popular the
[50:24.340 --> 50:29.500]  message that Andrew Napolitano is putting out is winning in the court of
[50:29.500 --> 50:42.340]  ideas big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers
[50:42.340 --> 50:50.380]  well so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from
[50:50.380 --> 50:56.700]  Austin Texas Alex Jones we're gonna be skipping this network right coming up
[50:56.700 --> 50:59.980]  so judge Andrew Napolitano have plenty of time with us he's with us until the
[50:59.980 --> 51:05.500]  bottom of the hour he just finished taping his show that will air Saturday
[51:05.500 --> 51:11.620]  on the Fox Business Channel it premiered last week to the highest ratings
[51:11.620 --> 51:17.100]  of any show on the Fox Business Network and my friends I mean I've said I can
[51:17.100 --> 51:20.580]  find no fault with judge Andrew Napolitano I mean he exposes the world
[51:20.580 --> 51:24.740]  government he exposes the false left-right paradigm he stands up to the
[51:24.740 --> 51:30.980]  Bill of Rights and Constitution no matter you know how politically
[51:30.980 --> 51:36.340]  incorrect it is and he is just such a great researcher and a fighter for
[51:36.340 --> 51:41.260]  Liberty and the fact that out of the gates his show is number one what does
[51:41.260 --> 51:46.020]  that say Chris Matthews can't get any viewers you know why does Fox News have
[51:46.020 --> 51:50.060]  conservatively five to ten times depending on the show the viewers of
[51:50.060 --> 51:54.620]  Chris Matthews on MSNBC it's because no one wants to hear establishments
[51:54.620 --> 52:01.060]  status socialist globalist lies and propaganda and you know compared to the
[52:01.060 --> 52:06.660]  rest of Fox News I mean judge Andrew Napolitano is you know like Glenn Beck
[52:06.660 --> 52:10.020]  and the rest of Fox is like Chris Matthews I mean I'm sorry if I had to use
[52:10.020 --> 52:15.460]  the analogy here and so that he's got top ratings when I knew it was gonna
[52:15.460 --> 52:18.460]  happen I mean I told him off here last time I was on I said watch you're gonna
[52:18.460 --> 52:23.060]  be number one I said guaranteed because the people are hungry and so talk
[52:23.060 --> 52:28.460]  about the success and we're gonna get into Obama's increasingly imperial
[52:28.460 --> 52:33.740]  presidency that according to my research is is exceeding anything we've ever
[52:33.740 --> 52:38.780]  seen in this country but first the second show coming up this Saturday tell
[52:38.780 --> 52:44.060]  people about it and what the success of your transmission means well the success
[52:44.060 --> 52:46.940]  for a transmission means a couple things it means that you can take a show
[52:46.940 --> 52:52.220]  from the internet and bring it to the TV screen it means that there is a first
[52:52.220 --> 52:59.300]  out there for a focus on the government that has a bias in favor of human
[52:59.300 --> 53:03.580]  liberty but believes that the individual is greater than the state that the
[53:03.580 --> 53:07.620]  individual has natural rights and in the mortal soul and the government is just
[53:07.620 --> 53:12.420]  an artificial creation based on fear and force that the Constitution means
[53:12.420 --> 53:16.820]  what it says that that government is best which governs least that the people
[53:16.820 --> 53:19.620]  are entitled to a constitute to a government that stays within the
[53:19.620 --> 53:23.300]  confines of the Constitution and that the Constitution was written to keep the
[53:23.300 --> 53:28.660]  backs off the people now none of those is a radical argument those are words
[53:28.660 --> 53:33.260]  for the most part from founding fathers and statesmen throughout the country
[53:33.260 --> 53:37.500]  unfortunately they don't resonate to the government they resonate to people who
[53:37.500 --> 53:42.420]  watch the government which is why I refer to myself here seriously and half
[53:42.420 --> 53:46.860]  and just on the show as a night watchman my job is to watch the government
[53:46.860 --> 53:51.860]  undercover of darkness and report to whoever wants to watch the show when
[53:51.860 --> 53:55.140]  the government steals liberty and when the government steals property and as
[53:55.140 --> 53:59.300]  you know Alex and you've been a pioneer here governments of both political
[53:59.300 --> 54:03.380]  parties I should say government of the one big government party with its
[54:03.380 --> 54:08.100]  Republican branch and its Democratic branch steal liberty and steal property
[54:08.100 --> 54:14.300]  every day when I attacked the Bush administration for this you know there are
[54:14.300 --> 54:18.500]  a lot of Republicans who kept their noses out of joint this morning when we
[54:18.500 --> 54:24.420]  taped our show for this weekend congressman Dana Rorobacker a right
[54:24.420 --> 54:28.460]  down the middle conservative Republican from Southern California former
[54:28.460 --> 54:34.180]  speechwriter for Ronald Reagan looked at me and said almost all Republicans in
[54:34.180 --> 54:38.820]  the House of Representatives now believe that the war in Iraq was a mistake
[54:38.820 --> 54:43.340]  that it was unlawful that it was immoral that it wasn't worth the lives
[54:43.340 --> 54:49.660]  lost or the trillions that will be spent now that is newsworthy that he would
[54:49.660 --> 54:55.140]  say it it is newsworthy that so many Republicans would change their mind it
[54:55.140 --> 54:58.980]  is newsworthy that people are starting to recognize that the government at
[54:58.980 --> 55:04.580]  almost all levels is out of control and there is a need for the Alex Jones show
[55:04.580 --> 55:09.340]  and for free to watch to remind people and when they know where to go they
[55:09.340 --> 55:13.980]  will go to listen to what the government is doing to them well there's no
[55:13.980 --> 55:18.980]  doubt that on a level playing field where the ideas of the Constitution the
[55:18.980 --> 55:24.020]  Bill of Rights our founders common sense when it's given a level playing field
[55:24.020 --> 55:31.060]  we win every time it's like in a last year Super Bowl team playing a group of
[55:31.060 --> 55:38.300]  five-year-old Pee Wee you know football players and that's why Obama is openly
[55:38.300 --> 55:41.900]  coming out the FCC the Federal Trade Commission and this isn't just on
[55:41.900 --> 55:46.940]  freedom watch or info wars.com now ladies and gentlemen it's now in the AP in
[55:46.940 --> 55:51.260]  the Financial Times of London Obama to have kill switch government to have
[55:51.260 --> 55:55.260]  black box in house that watches everything you do and filters what you
[55:55.260 --> 56:00.300]  can see government to have megaphone government to have behavior placement I
[56:00.300 --> 56:05.380]  mean this is bona fide tyranny this is proposed by the Republicans favorite
[56:05.380 --> 56:11.560]  Democrat Joe Lieberman of Connecticut under the guise of well if we are
[56:11.560 --> 56:16.700]  attacked if the power grid is attacked if the internet is attacked the
[56:16.700 --> 56:21.420]  president has to have the power to turn it off before the attackers can get the
[56:21.420 --> 56:25.980]  power is not hooked up to the internet precisely there's so much ill logic in
[56:25.980 --> 56:30.900]  there but put aside the illogic what about the Constitution what about if I
[56:30.900 --> 56:36.060]  want my laptop turned off I'll turn it off what about the fact that the laptop
[56:36.060 --> 56:41.140]  is just a modern way to exercise my freedom of speech and the whole purpose
[56:41.140 --> 56:44.860]  of the First Amendment according to Justice William Brennan one of the most
[56:44.860 --> 56:49.300]  liberal appointees of the 20th century is to keep the government out of the
[56:49.300 --> 56:54.180]  business of deciding what I read and what I watch and what I hear and presumes
[56:54.180 --> 56:58.660]  that the individual is competent to decide what to read watch here and say
[56:58.660 --> 57:02.740]  there is absolutely no authority under the Constitution whether under the
[57:02.740 --> 57:08.060]  under the guise of public safety or not and the government has always used
[57:08.060 --> 57:12.820]  public safety as the excuse to steal our liberties for the government to control
[57:12.820 --> 57:16.700]  the internet oh how the government would love to have the power over the
[57:16.700 --> 57:20.860]  internet that the Chinese government has over the internet there the internet
[57:20.860 --> 57:25.860]  has been the greatest tool of the exchange of ideas and of the search for
[57:25.860 --> 57:29.780]  truth since the invention of the printing press they can't control the
[57:29.780 --> 57:35.620]  printing press so they want to control the internet and expanding on that they
[57:35.620 --> 57:39.260]  know they can't compete with our ideas that's why Cass Sunstein the regulations
[57:39.260 --> 57:44.620]  are that's why the FCC's diversity czar praises censorship of Hugo Chavez I
[57:44.620 --> 57:49.340]  mean I think Americans need to realize that we're dealing with bona fide
[57:49.340 --> 57:56.580]  despots and tyrants here and we see Obama you know as bad as Bush was as bad
[57:56.580 --> 58:01.500]  as Clinton was it's just a progression but now because they're know there's
[58:01.500 --> 58:07.980]  awake a huge awakening happening they are accelerating their takeover and we
[58:07.980 --> 58:14.220]  see him federalizing the auto industry federalizing the banks we see him now
[58:14.220 --> 58:19.020]  according to eight senators and Fox News and others are reporting that Obama
[58:19.020 --> 58:23.260]  plans to sign an executive order legalizing all the illegal aliens for
[58:23.260 --> 58:26.740]  those that aren't a constitutional lawyer like yourself for a former top
[58:26.740 --> 58:30.460]  state judge the judge Andrew Napolitano will you explain to them because for my
[58:30.460 --> 58:37.900]  layman research the president executes law and the legislative passes it that
[58:37.900 --> 58:44.060]  is treason that is a act of sedition against our republic to have the
[58:44.060 --> 58:49.780]  president say that I'm gonna launch a war without Congress's approval I'm
[58:49.780 --> 58:54.860]  gonna legalize foreigners I mean can you speak to that sure sure I can speak
[58:54.860 --> 58:58.780]  to the president is taking a note to uphold the Constitution and the laws
[58:58.780 --> 59:04.060]  when the president does things like intimidate the bondholders of GM and
[59:04.060 --> 59:07.980]  Chrysler during their bankruptcies to break the law intimidate the banks to
[59:07.980 --> 59:13.100]  accept tarp monies that they don't want intimidate BP to cough up 58 20
[59:13.100 --> 59:16.860]  billion dollar flush fund that his political appointee can distribute
[59:16.860 --> 59:21.980]  however he wants intimidate insurance company executives not to raise
[59:21.980 --> 59:26.100]  premiums until the law that prohibits the raise comes into effect he is
[59:26.100 --> 59:32.980]  effectively writing laws himself that is on its face unconstitutional because
[59:32.980 --> 59:37.580]  the Constitution says only the Congress can write laws and not the president
[59:37.580 --> 59:42.540]  the flip side of this is when he says we haven't heard this out of his mouth but
[59:42.540 --> 59:45.980]  we've heard it from people around him and they're not denying it which is why
[59:45.980 --> 59:52.260]  Fox and other outlets are reporting it he is considering a blanket amnesty of
[59:52.260 --> 59:56.820]  all illegals in the country the last time we had an amnesty was in the Reagan
[59:56.820 --> 01:00:02.380]  administration it was done by the Congress only the Congress can do this by
[01:00:02.380 --> 01:00:06.860]  changing the law does the Congress have the power to change the law yes does the
[01:00:06.860 --> 01:00:11.900]  president have the power to change the law no so what could he do well he could
[01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:18.460]  with the stroke of a pen stop all arrests and stop all deportations now
[01:00:18.460 --> 01:00:23.700]  that would have the practical effect of saying to illegals you can say you can
[01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:29.460]  stay here the legal effect of that however is to frustrate federal law
[01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:33.780]  which says that illegals are not supposed to stay here they're supposed to go
[01:00:33.780 --> 01:00:38.860]  through the process of becoming legal and effectively is the opposite and so
[01:00:38.860 --> 01:00:43.900]  he's aiding and abetting lawbreakers because he's violating the law that the
[01:00:43.900 --> 01:00:49.220]  Congress has passed and and so isn't that treason no it's not treason under
[01:00:49.220 --> 01:00:54.940]  the Constitution but it is such an egregious failure to perform his duties
[01:00:54.940 --> 01:00:58.740]  that in my opinion it would be an impeachable offense I mean which is
[01:00:58.740 --> 01:01:04.820]  worse for Bill Clinton to lie under oath about sex with an intern or for Barack
[01:01:04.820 --> 01:01:09.220]  Obama to admit openly I don't like those laws so I'm not going to enforce them
[01:01:09.220 --> 01:01:14.100]  now a lot of presidents have done that George Bush once signed a law making it
[01:01:14.100 --> 01:01:20.020]  a crime for federal agents to read your mail before you do without a search warrant
[01:01:20.020 --> 01:01:24.140]  at the very moment that he signed the law he looked in the cameras and said I
[01:01:24.140 --> 01:01:28.260]  have no intention of enforcing this now at that point he's violating his oath
[01:01:28.260 --> 01:01:33.140]  because he took an oath to uphold the law President Obama if he does this
[01:01:33.140 --> 01:01:38.300]  nonsense this monstrosity of trying to grant amnesty to everybody that is here
[01:01:38.300 --> 01:01:43.340]  will effectively be doing the same thing I would argue that the violation of the
[01:01:43.340 --> 01:01:49.580]  oath the public acknowledgment of the failure to perform his job as president
[01:01:49.580 --> 01:01:54.540]  is far more a grounds for impeachment than what Clinton said he did with the
[01:01:54.540 --> 01:02:00.380]  intern under oath very well said I would imagine you're aware of this case but
[01:02:00.380 --> 01:02:06.340]  it's been in the Salt Lake City papers Nat Hentoff has written about it for the
[01:02:06.340 --> 01:02:11.660]  Redding Eagle Philadelphia man indicted for using right to free speech and I
[01:02:11.660 --> 01:02:14.780]  saw this a few months ago but now they're going ahead with the three
[01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:19.220]  felonies and the party's been charged for he was watching an unemployment
[01:02:19.220 --> 01:02:26.300]  debate about getting rid of his benefits and his quote is that are you
[01:02:26.300 --> 01:02:33.140]  crazy are you all insane no checks equals no food for me do you get it and
[01:02:33.140 --> 01:02:41.180]  he sent it as an email and under the telecommunications act of 1996 under
[01:02:41.180 --> 01:02:49.980]  section 1934 he did utilize a telecommunications device whether or
[01:02:49.980 --> 01:02:53.860]  not communication ensued without disclosing his identity it was his email
[01:02:53.860 --> 01:02:58.380]  and with the intent to annoy abuse threaten and harass any person who
[01:02:58.380 --> 01:03:01.780]  received the communication and it says he would serve the three counts
[01:03:01.780 --> 01:03:06.660]  concurrently as much as 30 years federally in prison for sent for calling
[01:03:06.660 --> 01:03:13.780]  the senator insane I would think that a federal judge would not permit such a
[01:03:13.780 --> 01:03:17.940]  prosecution I'm convinced absolutely that the third circuit court of appeals
[01:03:17.940 --> 01:03:22.380]  which is the federal appeals court that covers Pennsylvania would invalidate it
[01:03:22.380 --> 01:03:29.460]  that court particularly has a tradition of being very pro-individual against the
[01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:32.380]  government when it comes to express of sure but what does this say about the
[01:03:32.380 --> 01:03:38.220]  mindset of the people that are in these federal positions these federal
[01:03:38.220 --> 01:03:43.420]  prosecutors I mean now I mean that's an example of how they can pass a law and
[01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:48.020]  then not use it till 14 years later it's like well below the law is unconstitutionally
[01:03:48.020 --> 01:03:52.260]  vague and quite frankly Alex there are Supreme Court opinions that say
[01:03:52.260 --> 01:03:58.380]  that the Congress cannot stop you from annoying or offensive speech because the
[01:03:58.380 --> 01:04:02.180]  First Amendment protects annoying or offensive speech and the Supreme Court
[01:04:02.180 --> 01:04:06.700]  for all of all of the wacky things that it's done you know it's it allowed
[01:04:06.700 --> 01:04:13.140]  slavery it allowed abortion it allows prosecutions of of crimes that should
[01:04:13.140 --> 01:04:18.860]  exist today by a nine-to-nothing vote gave federal prosecutors the greatest
[01:04:18.860 --> 01:04:24.580]  rebuke that they have ever had in modern times when it found unconstitutional
[01:04:24.580 --> 01:04:29.900]  their favorite tool their favorite weapon which is the honest services law
[01:04:29.900 --> 01:04:34.860]  that law allowed federal prosecutors to prosecute even people who did the right
[01:04:34.860 --> 01:04:41.300]  thing if they harbored in their mind a desire to benefit from it themselves the
[01:04:41.300 --> 01:04:46.620]  mayor of Newark New Jersey went to jail because he had sex with a real estate
[01:04:46.620 --> 01:04:51.940]  agent that the city hired to sell city property did she sell the city property
[01:04:51.940 --> 01:04:57.580]  at market rates yes did the city lose a nickel yes but because the mayor had sex
[01:04:57.580 --> 01:05:01.420]  with her he was convicted by a federal prosecutor who's now the governor of
[01:05:01.420 --> 01:05:05.900]  New Jersey and by a federal jury in Newark for violating the honest services
[01:05:05.900 --> 01:05:09.620]  law he was more interested in sex than he was in a professional relationship
[01:05:09.620 --> 01:05:12.860]  well that's a thought crime I mean that's that's controlling who we can
[01:05:12.860 --> 01:05:16.060]  associate with the Supreme Court today with everybody from Ruth Bader
[01:05:16.060 --> 01:05:20.580]  Ginsburg to Antonin Scalia and the other seven in between agreeing invalidated
[01:05:20.580 --> 01:05:27.540]  that and said to the feds you cannot use language creatively to prosecute people
[01:05:27.540 --> 01:05:32.740]  you must use statutory language narrowly now at the risk of getting too into the
[01:05:32.740 --> 01:05:37.300]  weeds I make this argument for you Alex because I am convinced that this
[01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:40.660]  prosecution about which you have rightly complained and which you have
[01:05:40.660 --> 01:05:44.780]  wonderfully exposed in Philadelphia what never to occur and if it does occur
[01:05:44.780 --> 01:05:48.860]  will be thrown out at the appellate level especially especially after this
[01:05:48.860 --> 01:05:53.460]  case came down today but we should not even have people in a position of power
[01:05:53.460 --> 01:05:57.900]  in a position to decide who gets indicted and who gets prosecuted who have a
[01:05:57.900 --> 01:06:02.620]  mindset that they can use the power of the government to punish speech because
[01:06:02.620 --> 01:06:06.300]  if anything is sacrosanct in this country is that you could say anything you
[01:06:06.300 --> 01:06:10.340]  want anytime you want anywhere you want about anybody in the government that's
[01:06:10.340 --> 01:06:15.380]  what so that's what's so incredible about this is that we see countless videos of
[01:06:15.380 --> 01:06:19.260]  police beating somebody up and then charging the person they've beat up with
[01:06:19.260 --> 01:06:24.500]  assaulting them you see countless you know videos of police going to the wrong
[01:06:24.500 --> 01:06:28.940]  house and killing somebody shawawa we see countless videos of police all over
[01:06:28.940 --> 01:06:33.180]  the country pulling a motorcycler over who has a camera mounted on his head
[01:06:33.180 --> 01:06:38.260]  because he's video taping him's a YouTube video and indicting him for
[01:06:38.260 --> 01:06:43.420]  wiretapping when there's no reasonable perception of privacy I mean more and
[01:06:43.420 --> 01:06:50.460]  more the government is really showing us that they want to be tyrants that this
[01:06:50.460 --> 01:06:55.020]  is real tyranny but the good news is and it's evidence by your show being the
[01:06:55.020 --> 01:06:59.180]  number one show out of the gates on the Fox Business Network with its first
[01:06:59.180 --> 01:07:04.180]  premiere is that the sleeping giant is awakening I cannot stress enough judge
[01:07:04.180 --> 01:07:07.260]  Andrew DePolitano and for all the listeners out there I want you to
[01:07:07.260 --> 01:07:09.700]  briefly comment on this because we're almost out of time that when we say
[01:07:09.700 --> 01:07:13.660]  there's an awakening happening I don't think the system even understands how
[01:07:13.660 --> 01:07:19.020]  big this is I think I think you're right and and I've been privileged to come
[01:07:19.020 --> 01:07:23.340]  along at the right time my show Freedom Watch which can be seen on the Fox
[01:07:23.340 --> 01:07:29.700]  Business Network 10 a.m. and 8 p.m. these are Eastern times on Saturday 7 p.m.
[01:07:29.700 --> 01:07:35.220]  and 11 p.m. Eastern on Sunday has sort of captured the crest of a wave if you
[01:07:35.220 --> 01:07:38.860]  ask people Ron Paul told me this and he's right do you want to take care of
[01:07:38.860 --> 01:07:41.420]  yourself or you want the government to take care of you do you want to make
[01:07:41.420 --> 01:07:44.660]  decisions on your own or do you want the government to make decisions for you do
[01:07:44.660 --> 01:07:47.220]  you want to be able to think as you please and say what you think and
[01:07:47.220 --> 01:07:50.020]  publish what you say or do you want the government to interfere with that when
[01:07:50.020 --> 01:07:54.620]  you put things to people like that almost everyone comes down on the side of
[01:07:54.620 --> 01:07:58.460]  freedom and that's what's made Freedom Watch successful that's what's made you
[01:07:58.460 --> 01:08:03.420]  successful and that's what's made the government fearful well there's nothing
[01:08:03.420 --> 01:08:07.380]  better the few times in my life when I've had a chance to go for a hike a week
[01:08:07.380 --> 01:08:11.180]  long hike where you've got the backpack on you got your tent you've got your
[01:08:11.180 --> 01:08:15.420]  food and just to go out there and to rely on yourself and it's really an
[01:08:15.420 --> 01:08:19.620]  analogy of that I mean I don't want a bunch of distant bureaucrats who happen
[01:08:19.620 --> 01:08:23.100]  to be crooks nine times out of ten running my life it's so fundamental
[01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:26.900]  they've bankrupted our society they've launched all these illegal wars Bush
[01:08:26.900 --> 01:08:30.620]  three weeks ago was out giving speeches about how he ordered torture meanwhile
[01:08:30.620 --> 01:08:35.460]  they sent people to prison who followed those orders I mean this is tyranny and
[01:08:35.460 --> 01:08:40.180]  I keep saying that I mean folks do you know where tyranny leads and I think
[01:08:40.180 --> 01:08:44.740]  God's given us a chance I think you know history is giving us a chance judge and
[01:08:44.740 --> 01:08:48.940]  I want you to speak to this we are at a crossroads and if good people like
[01:08:48.940 --> 01:08:53.220]  yourself and Ron Paul and many others but also just the rank and file folks out
[01:08:53.220 --> 01:08:57.780]  there stand up as leaders speak up point out the Emperor is wearing no
[01:08:57.780 --> 01:09:02.300]  clothes and rebuke this evil like Hitler should have been rebuked like
[01:09:02.300 --> 01:09:06.940]  Stalin should have been rebuked or Mao Zedong before they really got going we
[01:09:06.940 --> 01:09:10.620]  have a chance to avert a historical disaster because there's no doubt
[01:09:10.620 --> 01:09:14.980]  studying history that if we don't take America back right now America won't
[01:09:14.980 --> 01:09:19.540]  lead us into the 21st century worldwide for liberty America will lead the way
[01:09:19.540 --> 01:09:24.500]  into a new dark age of despotism that dwarfs anything ever seen in the
[01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:27.900]  history of man I am reading a terrific book it's the second time I've read it
[01:09:27.900 --> 01:09:33.860]  in my life it's Hayek's HAYK FA Hayek's The Road to Serfdom it was written in
[01:09:33.860 --> 01:09:39.980]  1944 and it describes how Europe descended into serfdom as people like
[01:09:39.980 --> 01:09:45.260]  Mussolini and Hitler were popularly elected against legitimate opponents and
[01:09:45.260 --> 01:09:49.060]  the public and the government gave them all the power that they had it is
[01:09:49.060 --> 01:09:55.500]  eerily eerily reminiscent eerily predictive because it was written 65
[01:09:55.500 --> 01:10:01.380]  years ago of exactly what's happening today central planning by bureaucrats
[01:10:01.380 --> 01:10:06.180]  not even by popularly elected officials but by bureaucrats the decision that
[01:10:06.180 --> 01:10:12.220]  power is more in is more in the spotlight than liberty the decision that
[01:10:12.220 --> 01:10:17.220]  individuals should not be able to make choices for themselves look we have to
[01:10:17.220 --> 01:10:22.060]  be on the watch for the loss of liberty it doesn't happen overnight it happens
[01:10:22.060 --> 01:10:26.500]  slowly and it happens gradually and whenever anyone sees the loss of
[01:10:26.500 --> 01:10:30.020]  liberty whether it's a cop preventing someone from taking a picture of what
[01:10:30.020 --> 01:10:33.780]  the cop is doing or whether it's a prosecutor prosecuting someone for
[01:10:33.780 --> 01:10:38.180]  speaking the truth whether it's a judge compromising liberty or whether it's a
[01:10:38.180 --> 01:10:42.020]  public an elected official compromising liberty it must be shouted from the
[01:10:42.020 --> 01:10:46.500]  rooftops they can send it to me at Fox News and I'll get it on the air and they
[01:10:46.500 --> 01:10:50.020]  can send it to you at info wars and you'll get it on the air and it all
[01:10:50.020 --> 01:10:53.940]  makes sense well what about Obama people will see the truth what about Obama
[01:10:53.940 --> 01:10:59.140]  yesterday he weaseled into his speech about our democracy is about
[01:10:59.140 --> 01:11:04.420]  institutions not about individuals and individuals basically he said get in the
[01:11:04.420 --> 01:11:09.380]  way of America when we're not a democracy we're a republic can you speak to
[01:11:09.380 --> 01:11:13.940]  that disgusting statement oh sure I mean he believes that we are a democracy and
[01:11:13.940 --> 01:11:17.380]  he believes that we are not even a democracy of individuals but a
[01:11:17.380 --> 01:11:21.700]  democracy of groups he believes in collectivism which is that the groups to
[01:11:21.700 --> 01:11:26.180]  which we belong have rights we don't have rights as individuals and whichever
[01:11:26.180 --> 01:11:30.180]  group speaks the loudest can take its claim on the government he does not
[01:11:30.180 --> 01:11:34.100]  believe in natural rights he does not believe that the individual is greater
[01:11:34.100 --> 01:11:37.300]  than the government and he believes in a progressive form of government which is
[01:11:37.300 --> 01:11:40.420]  that the government knows best that would be the same government that told
[01:11:40.420 --> 01:11:44.740]  BP to drill in 5,000 feet instead of 500 feet even though nobody had ever
[01:11:44.740 --> 01:11:47.780]  monitored a wellhead that exploded at that depth
[01:11:47.780 --> 01:11:51.620]  that would be the same government that relied on an inaccurate computer
[01:11:51.620 --> 01:11:55.620]  models when they set out the process for BP filling out its forms
[01:11:55.620 --> 01:11:59.220]  for the for the permits that would be the same government that said to BP don't
[01:11:59.220 --> 01:12:03.220]  worry about liability the maximum you'll ever have to spend is 75 million
[01:12:03.220 --> 01:12:05.620]  dollars. Judge Andrew we are out of time

[01:13:36.740 --> 01:13:40.340]  father quotes diverse between a democracy and a republic and why the
[01:13:40.340 --> 01:13:45.380]  media always says democracy and why it's so important to expose that
[01:13:45.380 --> 01:13:48.660]  and i know you know that but the general public doesn't now they're ready to
[01:13:48.660 --> 01:13:51.780]  listen the awakening is on i mean look at judge
[01:13:51.780 --> 01:13:55.220]  anor napolitano he is a great guy he's anti new world order
[01:13:55.220 --> 01:13:59.220]  he's had me on his show despite the fact he's been given national criticism for
[01:13:59.220 --> 01:14:02.820]  it
[01:14:02.820 --> 01:14:06.020]  he was just inviting me in the future on his television program
[01:14:06.020 --> 01:14:10.660]  and he's judge anor napolitano is the closest thing to alex jones on national
[01:14:10.660 --> 01:14:15.060]  television and he's very well spoken very intelligent
[01:14:15.060 --> 01:14:19.140]  he's hardcore and of course he's got number one ratings
[01:14:19.140 --> 01:14:23.220]  i'll guarantee you they give him his own show on regular fox he will beat
[01:14:23.220 --> 01:14:29.460]  glenbeck within six months guaranteed i mean i was telling him a month ago
[01:14:29.460 --> 01:14:31.620]  actually about two three months ago i knew he was getting the show because he
[01:14:31.620 --> 01:14:34.660]  told me you know in confidence
[01:14:34.660 --> 01:14:37.940]  and i said it's going to be top ratings and he said well we just hope to
[01:14:37.940 --> 01:14:40.580]  you know do okay and i said no you're going to be number one
[01:14:40.580 --> 01:14:44.820]  it's like i told ventura i said your show is going to be number one on true
[01:14:44.820 --> 01:14:50.020]  network true tv it was number one number one
[01:14:50.020 --> 01:14:55.300]  number one show on the network that never had happened out of the gates
[01:14:55.300 --> 01:14:58.500]  number one new show in their history why
[01:14:58.500 --> 01:15:02.340]  because ladies and gentlemen if the times of india
[01:15:02.340 --> 01:15:05.620]  is reporting that their own government admits sodium fluoride
[01:15:05.620 --> 01:15:09.460]  is causing retardation and bone cancer nationwide
[01:15:09.460 --> 01:15:13.380]  in decade-long studies that's not going to be on cnn
[01:15:13.380 --> 01:15:17.140]  or msnbc or even fox i'm going to take the
[01:15:17.140 --> 01:15:21.620]  prestigious publication and i'm going to break that electronic berlin wall
[01:15:21.620 --> 01:15:26.420]  i'm going to read where it's conclusively hurting people
[01:15:26.420 --> 01:15:31.220]  now i already knew that but the point is is that now it's in mainstream news
[01:15:31.220 --> 01:15:34.020]  indian children blinded crippled by fluoride and water
[01:15:34.020 --> 01:15:40.340]  government university studies show conclusively this is the real issue
[01:15:40.340 --> 01:15:43.540]  i don't care about being called a kook i don't care about being laughed at i
[01:15:43.540 --> 01:15:47.380]  i mean you think 12 years ago when i would go expose the cps with bounties to
[01:15:47.380 --> 01:15:50.580]  kidnap kids that i cared of the media called me a nut and a liar
[01:15:50.580 --> 01:15:54.900]  or when i 13 years ago exposed that at birth all us children have blood taken
[01:15:54.900 --> 01:15:59.300]  for a pentagon bio weapons database now all of that's been declassified
[01:15:59.300 --> 01:16:03.540]  you think i care about being laughed at it'd be like if i had a neighbor
[01:16:03.540 --> 01:16:09.860]  who i had seen hit a woman on the head and drag her into his basement
[01:16:09.860 --> 01:16:12.660]  you know let's see at a storm cellar outside and i saw him hit a woman on the
[01:16:12.660 --> 01:16:15.460]  head uh you know when i got home from work at
[01:16:15.460 --> 01:16:19.300]  midnight this is hypothetical and i saw the woman screaming or get hit on the
[01:16:19.300 --> 01:16:22.900]  head and drug in and i called the cops and let's say he was the mayor
[01:16:22.900 --> 01:16:26.820]  there's actually been cases like this and so people didn't want to believe they
[01:16:26.820 --> 01:16:29.620]  and the cops said there's no way that mayor johnson
[01:16:29.620 --> 01:16:34.580]  mayor john doe did this and i would still know i saw him kill the woman
[01:16:34.580 --> 01:16:38.340]  i would go break in to prove it
[01:16:39.460 --> 01:16:43.780]  i mean i'm just being honest with you and so i don't care if cops come to my
[01:16:43.780 --> 01:16:46.980]  door if i saw the mayor kill a woman and and tell
[01:16:46.980 --> 01:16:50.020]  me i'm a kook and a nut i don't care if the cops started
[01:16:50.020 --> 01:16:53.220]  threatening me because the mayor ordered him to in that hypothetical world
[01:16:53.220 --> 01:16:57.140]  it's the same thing how am i supposed to know all of this
[01:16:57.140 --> 01:17:01.620]  and then not tell you perception is not reality
[01:17:01.620 --> 01:17:04.500]  as the globalist have brainwashed and taught the population
[01:17:04.500 --> 01:17:08.420]  perception is not reality if you give put a blindfold on somebody and they're
[01:17:08.420 --> 01:17:11.700]  perceiving darkness and they walk off the edge of a 50 story building they're
[01:17:11.700 --> 01:17:15.380]  going to die or if you give somebody some lsd
[01:17:15.380 --> 01:17:18.500]  and they're hallucinating that they're flying on a magic carpet and they jump
[01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:20.980]  off a 50 story building they're going to die folks
[01:17:20.980 --> 01:17:25.140]  just because they have the perception that they are on a
[01:17:25.140 --> 01:17:28.420]  magic carpet does not mean they're on a magic carpet
[01:17:28.420 --> 01:17:34.020]  it doesn't exist they're hallucinating it's a chemical reaction in the brain
[01:17:34.020 --> 01:17:37.700]  and there's also cultural peer pressure hallucinations
[01:17:37.700 --> 01:17:40.980]  where the Aztecs thought it was cool to sacrifice people every day
[01:17:40.980 --> 01:17:45.940]  when the sun came up when the sun went down the nazis had a cultural hallucination
[01:17:45.940 --> 01:17:49.620]  that they were doing good killing off
[01:17:49.620 --> 01:17:54.100]  uh jews and seventh day adventists and gypsies
[01:17:54.100 --> 01:18:00.980]  and other groups and and christian scientists
[01:18:00.980 --> 01:18:04.580]  they had a cultural peer pressure hallucination
[01:18:04.580 --> 01:18:08.820]  see humans are like dogs we're very pack oriented and when we see the alpha
[01:18:08.820 --> 01:18:11.380]  leaders the guys reading off teleprompters on
[01:18:11.380 --> 01:18:14.980]  chris mathews you know oh well the alpha dog who looks sharp and
[01:18:14.980 --> 01:18:16.980]  is well spoken says something it must be true
[01:18:16.980 --> 01:18:20.020]  no that will destroy you in this high tech society
[01:18:20.020 --> 01:18:22.740]  just like it would destroy you a thousand years ago
[01:18:22.740 --> 01:18:28.580]  in the valley that is mexico city today or 65 years ago with atolf hitler
[01:18:28.580 --> 01:18:33.060]  or 60 years ago with stallin or 50 years ago with malice tongue
[01:18:33.060 --> 01:18:37.220]  you must be willing to tell the truth and expose the emperors wearing no clothes
[01:18:37.220 --> 01:18:40.340]  so i'm going to your calls but i do want to have a little pit stop here and ask

[01:25:43.700 --> 01:25:47.300]  quitting just before the center left labor party was to dump him in the
[01:25:47.300 --> 01:25:50.580]  internal ballot in less than three years after a stunning election victory
[01:25:50.580 --> 01:25:54.100]  well we need to throw this new crone out who wants to
[01:25:54.100 --> 01:25:56.820]  literally have the climate cops they have now in australia
[01:25:56.820 --> 01:26:01.460]  what they're trying to set up here who just merciless control freaks

[01:26:08.900 --> 01:26:11.700]  control freak criminals they must be held at bay
[01:26:11.700 --> 01:26:14.820]  and they know full well carbon dioxide's what plants breathe
[01:26:14.820 --> 01:26:19.060]  they pick something that is non-toxic that everyone is releasing
[01:26:19.060 --> 01:26:22.420]  so they have an excuse to be involved in every facet of your life
[01:26:22.420 --> 01:26:26.580]  it is the control freaks valhalla it is their
[01:26:26.580 --> 01:26:30.740]  dream of all dreams it is their greatest
[01:26:30.740 --> 01:26:35.620]  paramount goal to run your life as every control freak degenerate
[01:26:35.620 --> 01:26:40.740]  and history has wanted to do andrew in california you're on the air welcome
[01:26:40.740 --> 01:26:44.660]  alex two years ago dr paul craig robert said
[01:26:44.660 --> 01:26:47.780]  as long as the dollar is pegged to china's currency
[01:26:47.780 --> 01:26:53.140]  the u.s economy is okay but when china decouples from the dollar
[01:26:53.140 --> 01:26:59.380]  watch out and over the weekend china depeg the u1 from the dollar
[01:26:59.380 --> 01:27:03.380]  i think it'd be interesting to hear what dr roberts has to say
[01:27:03.380 --> 01:27:07.780]  well they are moving further into the baskets so they are kind of
[01:27:07.780 --> 01:27:11.460]  creeping towards the exit so everyone doesn't stand here you're
[01:27:11.460 --> 01:27:13.620]  been in a movie and the credits are about to roll and
[01:27:13.620 --> 01:27:17.700]  the first few get up and others want to race them out and so china
[01:27:17.700 --> 01:27:21.140]  and others start creeping for the door but then the bankers go oh yeah we're
[01:27:21.140 --> 01:27:23.780]  going to bring the euro down because they control it all and china goes oh
[01:27:23.780 --> 01:27:26.900]  maybe we're with the dollar and then and then the euro goes back up and they
[01:27:26.900 --> 01:27:30.820]  start bringing the dollar down so it's all a control and the g20 admits this
[01:27:30.820 --> 01:27:35.540]  a control lowering of all the currencies basically simultaneously but
[01:27:35.540 --> 01:27:38.340]  i mean in the aggregate it's simultaneous they lower the euro they lower the
[01:27:38.340 --> 01:27:41.140]  dollar they lower the pound they lower the dollar they lower the euro
[01:27:41.140 --> 01:27:45.540]  you know they lower eastern european currencies they lower the yon the end
[01:27:45.540 --> 01:27:49.540]  they've been trying to get the chinese to up their currency
[01:27:49.540 --> 01:27:53.620]  and so yes the beginning of the end has begun
[01:27:53.620 --> 01:27:57.700]  we must blame the bankers blame the culprits identify them as criminals
[01:27:57.700 --> 01:28:01.140]  not your local bank that's been consolidated by this but jp morgan
[01:28:01.140 --> 01:28:06.260]  chase goldman sacks you know the top kingpins people that put obama in and
[01:28:06.260 --> 01:28:10.100]  control mit romney uh the fact that they're pushing him now is a hard
[01:28:10.100 --> 01:28:14.260]  conservative on fox uh o'reilly is i mean this is a guy who wrote
[01:28:14.260 --> 01:28:18.420]  the socialist health care and masters uses this is them i mean
[01:28:18.420 --> 01:28:21.540]  might as well leave a brock obama and i mean mit romney
[01:28:21.540 --> 01:28:25.140]  again he's good-looking like obama so it must be okay
[01:28:25.140 --> 01:28:29.060]  and again they make you hate bush so obama looks good they make you hate obama
[01:28:29.060 --> 01:28:32.980]  so mit romney looks good uh you know elected ron paul elected
[01:28:32.980 --> 01:28:36.420]  judge andrew napolitano these are people that have never straight off their
[01:28:36.420 --> 01:28:40.100]  core values who've all you want someone who's steadfast
[01:28:40.100 --> 01:28:43.300]  even if someone isn't perfect some of these people are not perfect
[01:28:43.300 --> 01:28:46.500]  as long as you know they're steadfast you know what you can expect
[01:28:46.500 --> 01:28:50.500]  but i mean yes for those that don't understand
[01:28:50.500 --> 01:28:55.060]  the basic economics all we have left is the dollar and it's being devalued at an
[01:28:55.060 --> 01:28:58.500]  accelerated rate but still people don't notice in months and years
[01:28:58.500 --> 01:29:02.260]  and when the dollar finally goes it could be an explosive
[01:29:02.260 --> 01:29:06.740]  depression a complete collapse which is exactly what the bankers want they've
[01:29:06.740 --> 01:29:10.020]  got us completely leveraged but the bankers have always said even at
[01:29:10.020 --> 01:29:13.460]  davos and other public statements they want to control
[01:29:13.460 --> 01:29:16.900]  collapse of western society as they designed it but they've done such a
[01:29:16.900 --> 01:29:21.940]  good job in poll axing our society that that it's
[01:29:21.940 --> 01:29:25.300]  starting to unravel a little faster than they thought and
[01:29:25.300 --> 01:29:29.220]  as in dame you know the black hole so deadly that it's sucking them in and
[01:29:29.220 --> 01:29:33.300]  sucking their minions in and sucking in mid-level minions who were like
[01:29:33.300 --> 01:29:37.460]  i was promised i'd be part of this i was i thought i was a ruling elite
[01:29:37.460 --> 01:29:40.340]  and the uh upper level they're saying well you weren't
[01:29:40.340 --> 01:29:46.180]  ha ha walk the plank and so that's where this is going anything else
[01:29:46.180 --> 01:29:49.380]  that's it all right god bless you yeah let's get him on about
[01:29:49.380 --> 01:29:52.900]  uh i did see china moving more away from the dollar over the weekend i didn't

[01:30:53.460 --> 01:30:57.700]  and uh montan refused to take the architects and engineers dvd
[01:30:57.700 --> 01:31:01.220]  he claimed they are not scientists he doesn't believe it he won't watch the
[01:31:01.220 --> 01:31:04.260]  dvd i know he's not coming out about 9 11
[01:31:04.260 --> 01:31:08.260]  but if you could get this information to him through the back channels

[01:31:20.020 --> 01:31:23.700]  pulled by the post office up there they were listed
[01:31:23.700 --> 01:31:27.620]  as one of the post offices that had these clandestine
[01:31:27.620 --> 01:31:33.780]  interrogation sorting rooms and uh the city of lake forest told me that no
[01:31:33.780 --> 01:31:37.460]  building permits had been pulled but of course that doesn't mean they weren't
[01:31:37.460 --> 01:31:40.340]  building something it is totally clandestine
[01:31:40.340 --> 01:31:43.940]  well they admit i mean i have mainstream news articles that they build
[01:31:43.940 --> 01:31:48.500]  interrogation rooms for the employees and to surveil the people in the sorting
[01:31:48.500 --> 01:31:52.660]  centers in these but it's secondarily we have news articles
[01:31:52.660 --> 01:31:56.260]  where they admit they will also use these facilities
[01:31:56.260 --> 01:32:00.740]  for forced inoculation centers so i mean that's on record
[01:32:00.740 --> 01:32:04.820]  yes indeed but at least no no permits had been pulled recently

[01:33:22.980 --> 01:33:27.460]  a revolutionary and truth is popular man um just like you said
[01:33:27.460 --> 01:33:31.380]  it's a chemical reaction in the brain dude uh it's horrible when
[01:33:31.380 --> 01:33:35.140]  complete strangers listen to you and believe you but your family does not
[01:33:35.140 --> 01:33:38.740]  and i have two points um one was about the police thing you were saying
[01:33:38.740 --> 01:33:42.500]  earlier how they not all police are bad but you got those ones that are
[01:33:42.500 --> 01:33:46.420]  programmed um back in march my last time i called
[01:33:46.420 --> 01:33:50.500]  in your show uh i had a show in sonoma county california
[01:33:50.500 --> 01:33:54.900]  in fairfield yeah bohemian grove character oh my god man those police
[01:33:54.900 --> 01:33:58.980]  there uh i had an argument with the promoter on the on the cell phone
[01:33:58.980 --> 01:34:03.380]  i came out of the store and sherif and highway patrol are waiting for me
[01:34:03.380 --> 01:34:08.580]  um i told them you know that if i wasn't a part of a criminal investigation and
[01:34:08.580 --> 01:34:11.060]  if i wasn't being charged with anything that they didn't have the right to
[01:34:11.060 --> 01:34:13.780]  identify me they didn't have the right to why were they waiting on you because
[01:34:13.780 --> 01:34:17.860]  you talked about the satanic rituals uh because i was basically
[01:34:17.860 --> 01:34:20.820]  i guess talking at an escalator level to this promoter because he wouldn't pay
[01:34:20.820 --> 01:34:23.860]  me and i was pissed off and i walk out of the store and they're there waiting
[01:34:23.860 --> 01:34:28.500]  for me somebody called the cops on me while i was in the store buying things
[01:34:28.500 --> 01:34:33.460]  um so i'm sorry to i'm i'm sorry to hear that and i appreciate your call

[01:34:52.820 --> 01:34:56.820]  australian prime minister vows that she will put
[01:34:56.820 --> 01:35:05.780]  our people under siege she will bring them to heal
[01:35:05.780 --> 01:35:10.580]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups

[01:35:36.980 --> 01:35:43.300]  if you have to pick one man uh who is the nemesis or the polar opposite
[01:35:43.300 --> 01:35:47.620]  whereas algor symbolizes fraud lack of integrity
[01:35:47.620 --> 01:35:52.980]  man bear pig uh selling nafta and gat selling globalism selling the
[01:35:52.980 --> 01:35:57.220]  industrialization he is a swindler he is a carnival
[01:35:57.220 --> 01:36:01.860]  barker who sells every uh projection and con game and
[01:36:01.860 --> 01:36:06.660]  fraud under the sun you have lord montan on the other side
[01:36:06.660 --> 01:36:10.900]  integrity focus documented because i've done a lot of research on global warming
[01:36:10.900 --> 01:36:14.420]  and anthropogenic global warming and the neo feudalist move and
[01:36:14.420 --> 01:36:18.100]  how this system will cause untold hundreds of millions of starve
[01:36:18.100 --> 01:36:23.060]  montan has the incredible research news site where he documents at all
[01:36:23.060 --> 01:36:26.020]  uh and we'll go over that with him today we'll talk about the new
[01:36:26.020 --> 01:36:29.540]  australian prime minister one is thrown out
[01:36:29.540 --> 01:36:33.460]  for his global carbon tax that's the main thing that australian cited
[01:36:33.460 --> 01:36:38.980]  then like shark teeth another scallywag rolls forward saying that's our number
[01:36:38.980 --> 01:36:43.140]  one agenda neo feudalism uh we'll talk about uh gore and what
[01:36:43.140 --> 01:36:46.100]  he's up to and we'll talk about how the un's trying to
[01:36:46.100 --> 01:36:48.900]  reorganize their global tax it's all coming up
[01:36:48.900 --> 01:36:52.260]  lord montan good to have you here with us it's a real pleasure to be back with
[01:36:52.260 --> 01:36:55.700]  you and god bless america absolutely god bless uh
[01:36:55.700 --> 01:36:58.900]  england everybody who's fighting for liberty against the e u takeover
[01:36:58.900 --> 01:37:02.900]  uh lord montan uh out of the gates what's most important in your mind
[01:37:02.900 --> 01:37:06.900]  i think well the thing that broke today is the news that
[01:37:06.900 --> 01:37:10.660]  kevin rudd the prime minister of australia who was swept to office
[01:37:10.660 --> 01:37:14.100]  on us on the one central pledge that he was going to
[01:37:14.100 --> 01:37:20.180]  introduce cap and trade or cap and tax uh has failed to do so
[01:37:20.180 --> 01:37:24.660]  and the left of his party has staged a coup against him
[01:37:24.660 --> 01:37:28.980]  and dislodged him as prime minister appointing somebody in his stead
[01:37:28.980 --> 01:37:32.260]  who will still not be able to get cap and tax through
[01:37:32.260 --> 01:37:37.700]  but he has failed because he was over ambitious and he's now the second
[01:37:37.700 --> 01:37:41.780]  australian politician to have lost office
[01:37:41.780 --> 01:37:45.540]  because of his belief naive as it is
[01:37:45.540 --> 01:37:49.060]  in the global warming scare the first one of course was malcolm turnbull
[01:37:49.060 --> 01:37:52.740]  the former leader of the opposition to kevin rudd who was
[01:37:52.740 --> 01:37:57.460]  turfed out by his own party because he had wanted to go along with rudd's
[01:37:57.460 --> 01:38:00.740]  emissions trading scheme so he got the boot
[01:38:00.740 --> 01:38:04.260]  tony abbot took over from him and that was several months ago
[01:38:04.260 --> 01:38:07.700]  and now rudd himself has got the boot once again
[01:38:07.700 --> 01:38:13.380]  because of his naive enthusiasm for what is now the collapsed scientific
[01:38:13.380 --> 01:38:17.300]  notion that the world is doomed because we've added a tiny fraction of extra
[01:38:17.300 --> 01:38:22.100]  co2 to the atmosphere well lord mongton uh you force them
[01:38:22.100 --> 01:38:25.380]  to now admit that we haven't been heating in 15 years
[01:38:25.380 --> 01:38:30.020]  we've been cooling for a decade they've been caught in premeditated fraud
[01:38:30.020 --> 01:38:34.180]  uh i don't really think these people are naive the leadership knows
[01:38:34.180 --> 01:38:39.940]  this is just a giant new uh taxing scheme and a way for government
[01:38:39.940 --> 01:38:44.500]  to quote end our industrialized society and deliver humanity
[01:38:44.500 --> 01:38:48.580]  into the hands of this despotic elite as feudal serfs
[01:38:48.580 --> 01:38:52.740]  i think it's quite worth worth remembering how it is that they concealed
[01:38:52.740 --> 01:38:56.660]  for as long as they did the fact that since the turn of the millennium on the
[01:38:56.660 --> 01:39:01.220]  first of january 2001 the trend of global temperatures
[01:39:01.220 --> 01:39:05.540]  has been a downtrend not a very significant downtrend but it certainly
[01:39:05.540 --> 01:39:09.380]  hasn't been an uptrend and as you rightly pointed out a moment ago
[01:39:09.380 --> 01:39:13.460]  for about 15 years there's now been barely significant
[01:39:13.460 --> 01:39:16.900]  global warming how did these facts eventually come to light
[01:39:16.900 --> 01:39:19.860]  well the bbc got in touch with me after the climate
[01:39:19.860 --> 01:39:24.260]  case scandal broke and they said what questions would i put
[01:39:24.260 --> 01:39:29.300]  if i were interviewing uh dr jones who ran this unit whose emails leaked all
[01:39:29.300 --> 01:39:32.740]  over the world and he's the one that compiles one of these global
[01:39:32.740 --> 01:39:36.340]  temperature data sets that tells us where the temperature is going up or
[01:39:36.340 --> 01:39:40.500]  down worldwide and so the bbc took my question
[01:39:40.500 --> 01:39:44.260]  and put them to professor jones and one of those questions was
[01:39:44.260 --> 01:39:47.540]  have we or have we not had a global cooling trend since the
[01:39:47.540 --> 01:39:51.140]  turn of the millennium lord montan got to interrupt you we'll come back and
[01:39:51.140 --> 01:40:02.900]  and uh get to the punchline on this straight ahead
[01:40:02.900 --> 01:40:06.980]  from his central texas command center deep behind enemy lines
[01:40:06.980 --> 01:40:10.740]  the information war continues it's alex jones
[01:40:10.740 --> 01:40:14.580]  and the gcn radio network
[01:40:14.580 --> 01:40:21.780]  well he is a tireless voice exposing the fact that anthropogenic
[01:40:21.780 --> 01:40:25.940]  or man-made global warming is a manifest fraud
[01:40:25.940 --> 01:40:29.700]  and we're getting an important update he joins us every month or two
[01:40:29.700 --> 01:40:33.220]  and we really appreciate his time lord christopher montan third viscount of
[01:40:33.220 --> 01:40:36.820]  montan and brentley of course the chief one of the chief
[01:40:36.820 --> 01:40:41.220]  advisors to margaret thatcher a journalist a scientist and vener
[01:40:41.220 --> 01:40:45.700]  and he is with us for the balance of the hour uh we have routed for now
[01:40:45.700 --> 01:40:48.900]  the carbon taxers in the court of public opinion but they're still
[01:40:48.900 --> 01:40:52.420]  implementing through states counties cities regions
[01:40:52.420 --> 01:40:55.140]  uh their carbon tax we're going to talk about how they've regrouped
[01:40:55.140 --> 01:40:59.460]  how they're deceptively counter-striking how they're changing their nomenclature
[01:40:59.460 --> 01:41:03.300]  with new lies for old they've also got some
[01:41:03.300 --> 01:41:07.380]  organized counter strikes on montan with straw men
[01:41:07.380 --> 01:41:13.300]  uh manufactured attacks so we're gonna let him defend himself on that front
[01:41:13.300 --> 01:41:16.500]  uh but uh out of the cage you probably don't want to talk about this because
[01:41:16.500 --> 01:41:20.660]  you're a gentleman but it is in fox news it isn't the associated press the
[01:41:20.660 --> 01:41:24.020]  orgonian that reportedly al gore whose wife is now
[01:41:24.020 --> 01:41:29.780]  leaving him uh was with this masseuse and there are
[01:41:29.780 --> 01:41:32.500]  crazies who make stuff up but we have no evidence of that
[01:41:32.500 --> 01:41:35.860]  and it sounds like him i mean he just looks like a pervert i'm sorry i mean if
[01:41:35.860 --> 01:41:40.180]  i saw him in a dark alley you wouldn't expect me to go there because i try to
[01:41:40.180 --> 01:41:44.420]  confine myself to uh the science and economics of this question
[01:41:44.420 --> 01:41:49.220]  what we can say is that al gore whether he lied to his wife or not i have the
[01:41:49.220 --> 01:41:52.740]  faintest idea nor am i interested what he has done
[01:41:52.740 --> 01:41:56.580]  is lie over and over again to the american people and the people of the
[01:41:56.580 --> 01:42:00.820]  world for great personal profit about the global warming
[01:42:00.820 --> 01:42:04.100]  scare but if it does come out that he did this to this
[01:42:04.100 --> 01:42:08.740]  al baby if you're listening to this i've now been trying to get you to debate
[01:42:08.740 --> 01:42:12.980]  with me on international television on global warming for nearly
[01:42:12.980 --> 01:42:17.060]  four years every broadcast i do i make the same
[01:42:17.060 --> 01:42:23.220]  challenge step up to the plate or go away into your collapsing arm chair forever
[01:42:23.220 --> 01:42:27.460]  leave the field free for us real men and so far
[01:42:27.460 --> 01:42:31.780]  al baby you haven't shown the courage of your convictions
[01:42:31.780 --> 01:42:34.740]  and the only conviction you're eventually going to get is a criminal
[01:42:34.740 --> 01:42:39.300]  conviction for racketeering under the federal recurse statute
[01:42:39.300 --> 01:42:42.820]  absolutely because there's clear evidence of that this could be completely
[01:42:42.820 --> 01:42:47.860]  made up uh that he groped this woman uh though i tend to believe it just at a
[01:42:47.860 --> 01:42:51.140]  gut level regardless going there i mean i've made that
[01:42:51.140 --> 01:42:54.980]  very plain to you that that's not what i do what i do is the science of the
[01:42:54.980 --> 01:42:57.300]  economics and the science of the economics say
[01:42:57.300 --> 01:43:02.420]  that al goh is wrong he's running scared fewer and fewer people are listening
[01:43:02.420 --> 01:43:05.860]  to him he now charges a fee the singapore government paid him a few
[01:43:05.860 --> 01:43:10.820]  months ago a fee of three hundred thousand dollars to make one
[01:43:10.820 --> 01:43:16.100]  rambling disappointing diffuse speech about global warming nobody
[01:43:16.100 --> 01:43:20.180]  except the singaporean government would now pay that kind of fee to him
[01:43:20.180 --> 01:43:24.900]  but he is a busted flush as far as global warming is concerned
[01:43:24.900 --> 01:43:28.260]  nobody takes him seriously on that subject anymore
[01:43:28.260 --> 01:43:31.460]  and indeed nobody now takes the official bodies on this
[01:43:31.460 --> 01:43:35.380]  seriously the official scientific bodies who have seen this as a way of
[01:43:35.380 --> 01:43:38.980]  making enormous money in rent seeking subsidies
[01:43:38.980 --> 01:43:42.500]  from taxpayers then they're all discredited now
[01:43:42.500 --> 01:43:45.700]  they've all passed from being scientific bodies to mere
[01:43:45.700 --> 01:43:49.940]  self-serving political pressure groups they too are now discredited we have
[01:43:49.940 --> 01:43:54.100]  just this week the united nations climate panel
[01:43:54.100 --> 01:43:57.300]  which is an enormous and growing bureaucracy
[01:43:57.300 --> 01:44:00.260]  which has just announced that this time because of the criticism that it's
[01:44:00.260 --> 01:44:03.140]  been terribly one-sided in its previous report
[01:44:03.140 --> 01:44:07.380]  it's going to widen the number of scientists it gets writing its next
[01:44:07.380 --> 01:44:10.020]  report but it's not actually going to widen
[01:44:10.020 --> 01:44:13.780]  their opinions it's still only going to choose those who believe
[01:44:13.780 --> 01:44:17.620]  the line which it wishes to pedal they're still not going to ask the real
[01:44:17.620 --> 01:44:21.140]  scientists who've done the real work showing what complete nonsense
[01:44:21.140 --> 01:44:24.580]  the official line actually is
[01:44:25.380 --> 01:44:32.340]  now lord mongton i want to go back to al gore and criminal prosecutions
[01:44:32.340 --> 01:44:35.380]  and then i want to look at how they're regrouping how they're trying to
[01:44:35.380 --> 01:44:38.980]  counter strike yeah and get your forecast
[01:44:38.980 --> 01:44:41.620]  you know as the leading general against these eugenicists
[01:44:41.620 --> 01:44:45.380]  of where you see them striking next but but going back to criminal
[01:44:45.380 --> 01:44:49.300]  prosecutions where are we on pochari where are we on
[01:44:49.300 --> 01:44:52.020]  uh... jones you got cut off on the break
[01:44:52.020 --> 01:44:55.220]  uh... earlier uh... when i had indeed let's do jones first of all
[01:44:55.220 --> 01:44:59.220]  um... he has been exonerated by the house of commons no surprises there
[01:44:59.220 --> 01:45:02.900]  because our parliament is the most true believing of half-witted
[01:45:02.900 --> 01:45:06.980]  um... credulous believers in this new religion of global warming
[01:45:06.980 --> 01:45:09.860]  and they were not prepared to admit that they got it wrong
[01:45:09.860 --> 01:45:13.540]  by finding him wrong so they they of course um uh washed their hands of it
[01:45:13.540 --> 01:45:17.620]  and said he was a splendid fellow really which he isn't he had destroyed
[01:45:17.620 --> 01:45:21.220]  data and procured the destruction of data from other scientists
[01:45:21.220 --> 01:45:25.060]  in a series of emails none of which is denied
[01:45:25.060 --> 01:45:29.300]  uh... for the sake of avoiding getting anyone to check his figures and see
[01:45:29.300 --> 01:45:33.540]  just how much they were simply made up so uh... the fact that the house of
[01:45:33.540 --> 01:45:37.300]  commons looked the other way is a very good indication of how the political
[01:45:37.300 --> 01:45:42.100]  establishment worldwide is not yet willing to admit what a colossal
[01:45:42.100 --> 01:45:45.140]  mistake it made it's just like dbt all over again
[01:45:45.140 --> 01:45:48.660]  however there is of course the splendid mr kuchinelli
[01:45:48.660 --> 01:45:51.540]  at in uh... virginia the attorney general there
[01:45:51.540 --> 01:45:56.340]  who is busy uh... chasing after uh... professor man
[01:45:56.340 --> 01:46:00.580]  at the uh... penn state university to find out whether
[01:46:00.580 --> 01:46:05.300]  he for the sake of getting grants had in any way been improperly handling or
[01:46:05.300 --> 01:46:10.100]  using or processing official data and that inquiry is still very much
[01:46:10.100 --> 01:46:16.260]  continuing pachori was being investigated by the uk charity commission
[01:46:16.260 --> 01:46:20.180]  for having filed bogus account three years in the row in a charity in the
[01:46:20.180 --> 01:46:24.020]  uk of which he is the sole trustee and if the trustees whose job it is to
[01:46:24.020 --> 01:46:28.020]  file correct account the charity commission likewise part of the
[01:46:28.020 --> 01:46:32.580]  establishment has now said well actually we're not going to go
[01:46:32.580 --> 01:46:36.420]  after him we're not even going to ask him to produce accounts for the year in
[01:46:36.420 --> 01:46:40.020]  which irregularities were approved by the complainant
[01:46:40.020 --> 01:46:43.540]  we're going to make him produce accounts for two uh...
[01:46:43.540 --> 01:46:47.460]  for a year that was two years later than the year in which the problem arose
[01:46:47.460 --> 01:46:51.540]  so clearly the most extraordinary lengths are being gone to
[01:46:51.540 --> 01:46:55.140]  by the public authorities worldwide to cover up
[01:46:55.140 --> 01:46:58.260]  the the defalcations and the criminalities
[01:46:58.260 --> 01:47:03.940]  of the likes of al gore and pachori and they're not actually going to go after
[01:47:03.940 --> 01:47:06.980]  any of these people because these people are part of the same establishment
[01:47:06.980 --> 01:47:09.540]  that ought to be going after them and bringing them to book
[01:47:09.540 --> 01:47:13.220]  well lord mongton what do we do then with this quandary
[01:47:13.220 --> 01:47:16.260]  uh... or this paradox of government
[01:47:16.260 --> 01:47:22.100]  stands to have the biggest increase in tax funding in human history yes a new
[01:47:22.100 --> 01:47:27.140]  form of total feudalism and serfdom is openly being established so how can the
[01:47:27.140 --> 01:47:30.980]  government that is the beneficiary robber class
[01:47:30.980 --> 01:47:35.380]  the new kings and queens you know the new global lords of the people
[01:47:35.380 --> 01:47:39.540]  how then can this uh... group ever judge
[01:47:39.540 --> 01:47:43.060]  their own uh... minions their own operatives
[01:47:43.060 --> 01:47:47.060]  if they're cutting off their own a new global religion and funding mechanism
[01:47:47.060 --> 01:47:50.740]  well there you're asking one of the oldest questions in the history of the
[01:47:50.740 --> 01:47:56.180]  philosophy of government and in latin it was quisk custodian ipso's custodian
[01:47:56.180 --> 01:48:00.580]  who will watch over those who are supposed to be watching over us
[01:48:00.580 --> 01:48:03.620]  who will be the policeman of the policemen
[01:48:03.620 --> 01:48:07.460]  and that's one of the most difficult questions to answer however
[01:48:07.460 --> 01:48:11.540]  in a democracy which you still have in america and we don't have
[01:48:11.540 --> 01:48:16.500]  here in in europe because we are now governed by unelected commissars
[01:48:16.500 --> 01:48:20.100]  uh... but you still have a congress and the only people who can make laws for
[01:48:20.100 --> 01:48:22.820]  you are your elected congressman and senators
[01:48:22.820 --> 01:48:26.260]  under article one section one of your constitution three
[01:48:26.260 --> 01:48:30.180]  magic words will tell you what to do with these wretches
[01:48:30.180 --> 01:48:35.780]  vote them out well that brings me to my next issue
[01:48:35.780 --> 01:48:41.140]  uh... how they're regrouping worldwide uh... they they seem to double down in
[01:48:41.140 --> 01:48:44.820]  england double down in the united states double down
[01:48:44.820 --> 01:48:49.060]  in australia when one crook gets thrown out
[01:48:49.060 --> 01:48:52.980]  the establishment uh... especially the parliamentary system
[01:48:52.980 --> 01:48:57.140]  tends to put an even more extreme person in but here in the u.s. every
[01:48:57.140 --> 01:49:00.580]  incumbent and everyone who's seen as an establishment candidate in all the
[01:49:00.580 --> 01:49:06.100]  off-year elections and primaries are being defeated by giant record margins
[01:49:06.100 --> 01:49:09.860]  and the people are so angry that we've never had a political realignment
[01:49:09.860 --> 01:49:12.660]  where it was against the entire political system
[01:49:12.660 --> 01:49:16.900]  since seventeen seventy six uh... and other political scientists agree with me
[01:49:16.900 --> 01:49:20.980]  the polls show it usually one party's in favor another is out of favor
[01:49:20.980 --> 01:49:24.820]  this is a total realignment against the entire system
[01:49:24.820 --> 01:49:27.940]  and the system is coming in with obama saying well i'll just restrict your
[01:49:27.940 --> 01:49:31.460]  free speech i'll just put in chinese style net censorship
[01:49:31.460 --> 01:49:35.380]  i'll put black boxes in your house uh... will will make it illegal
[01:49:35.380 --> 01:49:38.820]  uh... as cast sunstein has said at the white house to say i don't believe in
[01:49:38.820 --> 01:49:41.380]  anthropogenic global warming i mean they are
[01:49:41.380 --> 01:49:44.820]  instead of backing off they're throwing the gauntlet down and saying
[01:49:44.820 --> 01:49:49.140]  i am tyranus i'm coming after you that's right however
[01:49:49.140 --> 01:49:53.620]  the republicans are beginning to respond to this they've begun to realize that
[01:49:53.620 --> 01:49:56.420]  the tea party movement is directed as much of them
[01:49:56.420 --> 01:50:01.220]  as it is at the democrat telling both parties to raise their game
[01:50:01.220 --> 01:50:05.540]  the democrats are resorting to insult and as you say to
[01:50:05.540 --> 01:50:09.460]  uh... police state measures taking away uh... your fifth amendment not your
[01:50:09.460 --> 01:50:12.900]  fifth amendment right the first amendment right to free speech
[01:50:12.900 --> 01:50:17.300]  by saying uh... that you you won't in future be allowed to say that global
[01:50:17.300 --> 01:50:19.780]  warming isn't a problem that kind of thing
[01:50:19.780 --> 01:50:23.700]  is intolerable in a free society and there is
[01:50:23.700 --> 01:50:27.380]  absolutely no way obama is going to get away with that because the republicans
[01:50:27.380 --> 01:50:31.620]  are beginning at last to wake up i've spent a lot of time in congress over
[01:50:31.620 --> 01:50:34.500]  the last year talking to members of both houses testifying in front of
[01:50:34.500 --> 01:50:37.380]  committees of congress and one of the things that's become quite apparent
[01:50:37.380 --> 01:50:40.340]  is that the republicans who weren't first a year ago saying well
[01:50:40.340 --> 01:50:43.300]  we're very happy to argue this on the economics because it makes no sense to
[01:50:43.300 --> 01:50:45.620]  do anything about this even if the problem is as big as the
[01:50:45.620 --> 01:50:49.620]  u.s. entities we can all see that but we don't think we dare get into the science
[01:50:49.620 --> 01:50:53.620]  now i said to the very bluntly i said look you don't get into the science
[01:50:53.620 --> 01:50:57.700]  the other side will simply say ah but the planet is at risk
[01:50:57.700 --> 01:51:01.540]  and therefore whatever the economic cost whatever the economic damage
[01:51:01.540 --> 01:51:04.740]  we have to save the planet and therefore you have to deal with the
[01:51:04.740 --> 01:51:08.500]  science otherwise however sensible your economic argument the other side will
[01:51:08.500 --> 01:51:11.300]  the science is the key because it takes the moral
[01:51:11.300 --> 01:51:15.780]  high ground away from them and shows them to eat premeditated fraudsters
[01:51:15.780 --> 01:51:19.620]  and that is the point which the republicans have now got very very firmly
[01:51:19.620 --> 01:51:23.940]  on board there are now many senior figures in both houses are not going to name
[01:51:23.940 --> 01:51:27.780]  names who's not fair to them they will go public as and when they think it right
[01:51:27.780 --> 01:51:31.860]  who are very clearly understanding that the science
[01:51:31.860 --> 01:51:36.260]  doesn't add up anymore that they have failed and failed and failed again
[01:51:36.260 --> 01:51:39.460]  on the other side to produce convincing argument
[01:51:39.460 --> 01:51:42.740]  and they are now not going to tolerate
[01:51:42.740 --> 01:51:45.700]  any form of cap and trade and they've made that quite plain to the democrats
[01:51:45.700 --> 01:51:48.900]  which is right lord montan stay there stay there we got to go to break come
[01:51:48.900 --> 01:51:51.700]  back and tell us more of what the insiders told you and
[01:51:51.700 --> 01:51:56.660]  how you see the uh eugenesis the feudalist the feudal lords are striking
[01:51:56.660 --> 01:52:00.420]  back at us on the other side
[01:52:02.340 --> 01:52:05.860]  a real shift in opinion on the republican side
[01:52:05.860 --> 01:52:10.020]  uh of course the tea party movement doesn't believe in the global warming nonsense
[01:52:10.020 --> 01:52:14.180]  and now the republicans are beginning to realize that they have to tackle the
[01:52:14.180 --> 01:52:17.300]  science they can't ignore it they have to take the moral
[01:52:17.300 --> 01:52:20.260]  high ground away from these creeps and they're
[01:52:20.260 --> 01:52:23.140]  beginning to do it they're beginning to get into the science they're beginning
[01:52:23.140 --> 01:52:25.780]  to ask questions of the administration that the administration
[01:52:25.780 --> 01:52:29.780]  either can't answer or is answering in a way which we can easily prove to be
[01:52:29.780 --> 01:52:33.220]  dishonest and that has begun to make them realize
[01:52:33.220 --> 01:52:36.980]  that this is a gigantic global fraud and they don't like the smell of it and
[01:52:36.980 --> 01:52:41.700]  they're not going to pass cap and trade even if the oil spill goes on being
[01:52:41.700 --> 01:52:44.180]  terrible and makes a mess of the coastline there
[01:52:44.180 --> 01:52:48.180]  they're not going to give in just because of that that is not a good excuse
[01:52:48.180 --> 01:52:52.820]  for rushing for cap and trade so um they're going to stand very firm on this
[01:52:52.820 --> 01:52:56.420]  and there will be no nonsense and if obama tries to reintroduce cap and trade
[01:52:56.420 --> 01:53:01.300]  in the senate he will fail again but he's doing the same thing now it's
[01:53:01.300 --> 01:53:06.020]  been confirmed the white house is not uh retracting it
[01:53:06.020 --> 01:53:09.060]  just like two weeks before but the white house admitted it
[01:53:09.060 --> 01:53:12.740]  they said uh you know we're going to sue arizona
[01:53:12.740 --> 01:53:16.260]  and then later the white house admitted that now he's saying he's going to sign
[01:53:16.260 --> 01:53:19.860]  an executive order to just open up the borders completely which
[01:53:19.860 --> 01:53:24.500]  literally is an act of treason against our sovereignty and he's now promised
[01:53:24.500 --> 01:53:31.060]  to have the epa implement a whole group of carbon taxes
[01:53:31.060 --> 01:53:36.740]  by dictatorial executive edict i know the more he does this and the more the
[01:53:36.740 --> 01:53:40.340]  people who listen to your show and the others who point out what's going on
[01:53:40.340 --> 01:53:44.100]  hear this and talk to one another about it the more certainly it is that in the
[01:53:44.100 --> 01:53:48.900]  midterm election he will perhaps more or less certainly lose the house and the
[01:53:48.900 --> 01:53:52.900]  way he's going he could even lose the senate as well that'll be harder i think
[01:53:52.900 --> 01:53:56.100]  but he's certainly no longer going to have control of congress
[01:53:56.100 --> 01:54:00.740]  and therefore he is increasingly being driven back on the realization
[01:54:00.740 --> 01:54:04.420]  that his days of passing grand legislative projects like healthcare
[01:54:04.420 --> 01:54:08.340]  reform are over cap and trade is not going to go through the
[01:54:08.340 --> 01:54:11.140]  senate and that therefore he will have to
[01:54:11.140 --> 01:54:15.220]  increasingly try to rule by decree because that's what an executive order
[01:54:15.220 --> 01:54:18.820]  is uh however executive orders are not legislation
[01:54:18.820 --> 01:54:23.380]  they can be reversed by the next incoming president overnight
[01:54:23.380 --> 01:54:26.580]  and all the republicans have to do is to say that whoever they choose as
[01:54:26.580 --> 01:54:29.460]  president every single one of these executive
[01:54:29.460 --> 01:54:33.460]  high-handed executive orders will simply be cancelled by a single executive
[01:54:33.460 --> 01:54:37.700]  order nullifying the lot and that will be the end of that
[01:54:37.700 --> 01:54:42.260]  so the fact that he can't now control congress means that he's becoming
[01:54:42.260 --> 01:54:45.780]  increasingly desperate and the more desperate he becomes the more he will
[01:54:45.780 --> 01:54:49.780]  lash out because he is very petulant i mean he's behaved if you look at the way
[01:54:49.780 --> 01:54:53.780]  he he dismissed general mccrystal who's a very good general
[01:54:53.780 --> 01:54:58.260]  and put in um a general patrice who is a formidable general so at least we've
[01:54:58.260 --> 01:55:02.980]  now got another very good general on the spot but that kind of behavior
[01:55:02.980 --> 01:55:07.300]  is calculated to demoralize your troops on the ground
[01:55:07.300 --> 01:55:11.460]  okay so the general made some incautious remarks which weren't very polite about
[01:55:11.460 --> 01:55:14.900]  the administration just get used to it obama you're
[01:55:14.900 --> 01:55:18.580]  in politics that he sometimes even your own troops are going to say things that
[01:55:18.580 --> 01:55:22.260]  maybe they shouldn't say but if you go around sacking them
[01:55:22.260 --> 01:55:26.100]  just because they exercise their right of free speech and you're the commander
[01:55:26.100 --> 01:55:29.540]  in chief well yes you have the constitutional power
[01:55:29.540 --> 01:55:34.100]  to do that but the electorate has the constitutional power to do it to you
[01:55:34.100 --> 01:55:37.620]  so obama because of that action against the military
[01:55:37.620 --> 01:55:41.220]  because of these threats of making executive orders because of your
[01:55:41.220 --> 01:55:45.780]  utter failure to deal with the bp oils bill in an efficient way
[01:55:45.780 --> 01:55:50.180]  you sir are going to be dismissed by your commander in chief
[01:55:50.180 --> 01:55:53.700]  which is the voters of the united states of america
[01:55:53.700 --> 01:55:58.100]  we're gonna get into bp after the break but briefly how is the un regrouping
[01:55:58.100 --> 01:56:02.420]  uh i mean we know they're trying to get cap and trade in at an even regional
[01:56:02.420 --> 01:56:07.060]  level having the bureaucracy come in and in one case get the city of austin
[01:56:07.060 --> 01:56:10.660]  to more than triple power prices in the next three years
[01:56:10.660 --> 01:56:16.340]  uh to pay some nebulous organization uh but uh when we come back
[01:56:16.340 --> 01:56:20.260]  but go ahead and get started now how are they internationally regrouping right
[01:56:20.260 --> 01:56:25.220]  now oh that's a very interesting one yes we'll certainly do with that when we come back
[01:56:25.220 --> 01:56:29.220]  and then specifically uh how we counter them with lord montan
[01:56:29.220 --> 01:56:32.660]  in the in the 30 seconds we've got left tell tell folks some of the material
[01:56:32.660 --> 01:56:37.140]  that we'll learn at your website right here the the most important things we do
[01:56:37.140 --> 01:56:41.700]  are a series of scientific papers which come out of regular intervals
[01:56:41.700 --> 01:56:45.540]  going at all written in plain language so that a layman can understand it
[01:56:45.540 --> 01:56:50.580]  explaining why on various aspects the science of climate change is not a problem
[01:56:50.580 --> 01:56:54.900]  and it's science and public policy dot or g
[01:56:54.900 --> 01:56:58.340]  it's important to learn the science and you'll understand the type of frauds
[01:56:58.340 --> 01:57:01.700]  that we're talking about law chris from montan's our guests i'm alex jones
[01:57:01.700 --> 01:57:06.980]  info wars dot com is our website stay with us
[01:57:10.900 --> 01:57:14.100]  science and public policy dot org

[01:57:34.900 --> 01:57:38.420]  move quickly now through some of the points that we foreshadowed
[01:57:38.420 --> 01:57:41.940]  but first off i just want to commend you here on air
[01:57:41.940 --> 01:57:46.020]  because you are a testament of somebody for close to two decades
[01:57:46.020 --> 01:57:49.780]  who tirelessly recognize a threat before others
[01:57:49.780 --> 01:57:54.660]  stood up against them and went only on the facts and have
[01:57:54.660 --> 01:57:58.260]  uh... not single-handedly but if you have to give the credit to one person
[01:57:58.260 --> 01:58:02.580]  devastated this true threat to human civilization
[01:58:02.580 --> 01:58:08.340]  exploration of society and so from my family to yours i commend you
[01:58:08.340 --> 01:58:12.020]  so can you briefly speak about the satisfaction you must have
[01:58:12.020 --> 01:58:15.140]  for others uh... you know out there so they can realize the satisfaction they
[01:58:15.140 --> 01:58:19.300]  can have by taking action against evil i mean it's got to be satisfying
[01:58:19.300 --> 01:58:22.500]  to go from a voice in the wilderness to sing
[01:58:22.500 --> 01:58:28.820]  uh... this massive uh... turning of the tide a and then b
[01:58:28.820 --> 01:58:33.540]  our work isn't done though how satisfying would it be to see the people
[01:58:33.540 --> 01:58:37.140]  promoting world government and now they have to admit that they are trying to
[01:58:37.140 --> 01:58:42.660]  set this up to see them fully routed and fully defeated please speak to that
[01:58:42.660 --> 01:58:46.580]  yes certainly first of all you're very kind that's too kind
[01:58:46.580 --> 01:58:50.500]  um... i'm one of the johnny come lately in this i've only been really active in
[01:58:50.500 --> 01:58:55.620]  the last three or four years in in uh... trying to expose this because i came
[01:58:55.620 --> 01:59:00.100]  under unexpectedly savage attack four years ago when i first
[01:59:00.100 --> 01:59:03.620]  went public with a major article in a british sunday newspaper the sunday
[01:59:03.620 --> 01:59:07.940]  telegraph and the international climate extremist left
[01:59:07.940 --> 01:59:12.420]  began a vicious series of attacks on me in newspapers on the blogosphere all
[01:59:12.420 --> 01:59:15.460]  over the place and i thought this was very strange because
[01:59:15.460 --> 01:59:19.460]  all i'd done was a a quiet quite large article it's got a certain amount of
[01:59:19.460 --> 01:59:22.900]  prominence the uh... the website of the newspaper
[01:59:22.900 --> 01:59:26.420]  actually crashed because 127 thousand people tried to access it in two hours
[01:59:26.420 --> 01:59:30.900]  after it was published so it was very popular but even so this very extreme
[01:59:30.900 --> 01:59:34.260]  reaction i'd never seen this before
[01:59:34.260 --> 01:59:38.820]  so i looked at the point of science on which they were trying to attack me
[01:59:38.820 --> 01:59:42.180]  and wherever they were trying to attack me most viciously
[01:59:42.180 --> 01:59:46.660]  they were trying to beat people away from understanding the point that i was
[01:59:46.660 --> 01:59:50.020]  making it they were trying to confuse they were desperate they wanted to set a
[01:59:50.020 --> 01:59:54.020]  precedent that anyone that spoke up would be torn apart anybody who was a
[01:59:54.020 --> 01:59:58.580]  professor would lose their tenure but but but going back sir
[01:59:58.580 --> 02:00:02.420]  i mean you're not kind to yourself i've i've seen writings of you
[02:00:02.420 --> 02:00:06.260]  20 plus years ago fighting the fake environmental movement
[02:00:06.260 --> 02:00:09.700]  20 plus years ago fighting the international communist movement
[02:00:09.700 --> 02:00:14.660]  see i see that as one contiguous uh... system yes you've been particularly
[02:00:14.660 --> 02:00:17.620]  vocal on the anthropogenic global warming fraud
[02:00:17.620 --> 02:00:20.900]  because it's come to the fore in the last four years but correct me if i'm
[02:00:20.900 --> 02:00:25.540]  wrong you've been battling this very same gaggle for decades
[02:00:25.540 --> 02:00:28.740]  oh certainly yes i mean i've been battling against for instance the
[02:00:28.740 --> 02:00:33.140]  the european dictatorship uh... we no longer have democracy in europe now i've
[02:00:33.140 --> 02:00:37.140]  been fighting that for 20 or 30 years i've been fighting communism i was one
[02:00:37.140 --> 02:00:39.460]  of those who played a small part in bringing the
[02:00:39.460 --> 02:00:43.540]  Berlin Wall down uh... because i worked for Margaret Thatcher and i knew
[02:00:43.540 --> 02:00:47.300]  Ron Reagan as well and you know we we we did that
[02:00:47.300 --> 02:00:52.900]  and i i was very honored to be a tiny tiny cog in in in the great governmental
[02:00:52.900 --> 02:00:56.180]  machine of Margaret Thatcher for four years in number 10 Downing Street
[02:00:56.180 --> 02:00:59.700]  um... but it's gotta be satisfying i mean it's gotta be satisfying
[02:00:59.700 --> 02:01:03.860]  well uh... satisfying is is the wrong word i think what is what is nice is how
[02:01:03.860 --> 02:01:06.900]  many kind people write to me out of the blue
[02:01:06.900 --> 02:01:10.660]  saying they've seen some vicious attack on me somewhere by the international
[02:01:10.660 --> 02:01:13.860]  climate extremist movement and they say that the fact that you're
[02:01:13.860 --> 02:01:16.980]  still here after all these attacks on you
[02:01:16.980 --> 02:01:20.340]  tells us you must be doing something right and you mustn't think that these
[02:01:20.340 --> 02:01:23.540]  people represent uh... how general how people generally think
[02:01:23.540 --> 02:01:26.980]  uh... and a lot of people are very very kind in getting in touch just a short
[02:01:26.980 --> 02:01:31.780]  email here or there saying you know we are so grateful that you
[02:01:31.780 --> 02:01:34.980]  are standing up and speaking out because somebody's got to
[02:01:34.980 --> 02:01:38.580]  and and you're using your platform you know they're they're very sweet about it
[02:01:38.580 --> 02:01:41.860]  and it may it may it makes a lot of difference that because it's actually
[02:01:41.860 --> 02:01:45.060]  quite hard being in the firing line all the time
[02:01:45.060 --> 02:01:48.820]  and having the most unspeakable things done by people who ought to know better
[02:01:48.820 --> 02:01:52.020]  in journalism in academia and elsewhere and so
[02:01:52.020 --> 02:01:56.180]  uh... i i am very grateful to you and to others who do speak the occasional kind
[02:01:56.180 --> 02:02:00.420]  word because it cheers me up no end but uh... again it's not just about talking
[02:02:00.420 --> 02:02:04.020]  about lord montan today i'm just holding you up because you deserve it
[02:02:04.020 --> 02:02:07.140]  as somebody who has gone through the fire and come out better
[02:02:07.140 --> 02:02:10.500]  on the other side i mean this is a giant criminal
[02:02:10.500 --> 02:02:14.340]  premeditated seizure of all of human society
[02:02:14.340 --> 02:02:19.860]  and you are traveling i mean i'm i'm i'm pretty young and i'm i'm in good shape
[02:02:19.860 --> 02:02:23.620]  and i get exhausted when i fly around a bunch of places i mean you have been to
[02:02:23.620 --> 02:02:27.060]  the four corners of the earth i have watched your labors
[02:02:27.060 --> 02:02:31.540]  and i have seen you devastate the enemy and so i just can't help but at a very
[02:02:31.540 --> 02:02:35.220]  instinctive primitive level someone who's fighting against people who
[02:02:35.220 --> 02:02:37.620]  literally want to cut the resources off to my family
[02:02:37.620 --> 02:02:40.980]  and who i know are a bunch of eugenics control freak
[02:02:40.980 --> 02:02:46.260]  population reducers all i can do is say uh you know hail lord montan we
[02:02:46.260 --> 02:02:49.460]  appreciate you well bless you that's very very kind
[02:02:49.460 --> 02:02:52.420]  i mean that is the most satisfying part about it that
[02:02:52.420 --> 02:02:57.140]  wherever i go very large crowds turn up i mean i did a tour of australia earlier
[02:02:57.140 --> 02:03:00.100]  this year which played i think a small part in
[02:03:00.100 --> 02:03:05.220]  in bringing kevin rudd down um because he was so stupid i did offer to go and
[02:03:05.220 --> 02:03:08.580]  see him and explain why the climate isn't the trouble he thinks it is but he
[02:03:08.580 --> 02:03:12.580]  he wouldn't see me um but i mean huge audiences turned up
[02:03:12.580 --> 02:03:17.140]  everywhere thousands at a time and and they came from out of the bush they
[02:03:17.140 --> 02:03:21.060]  came from out of these the towns and cities they came from out of the mines
[02:03:21.060 --> 02:03:24.660]  and they just came and you know the miners in particular in new castle which
[02:03:24.660 --> 02:03:28.740]  was the the mining district just north of Sydney they came in in huge numbers
[02:03:28.740 --> 02:03:32.180]  we'd booked a you know medium-sized room in the town hall we had to jack
[02:03:32.180 --> 02:03:35.780]  jack that in and go for the main town hall building that wasn't big enough so
[02:03:35.780 --> 02:03:39.300]  we took over the gallery and there were still people in line outside when i
[02:03:39.300 --> 02:03:43.700]  started talking um wonderful crowd now we found australia
[02:03:43.700 --> 02:03:48.820]  is just on fire with liberty really waking up to canada the us england
[02:03:48.820 --> 02:03:52.500]  europe this is so exciting now uh in the time we've got left
[02:03:52.500 --> 02:03:55.060]  finishing up that question i asked for the break
[02:03:55.060 --> 02:03:59.140]  specifically what is their international stratagem
[02:03:59.140 --> 02:04:04.420]  to deceptively uh try to because we know these people never give up
[02:04:04.420 --> 02:04:06.740]  to try to force through this global tax
[02:04:06.740 --> 02:04:10.420]  well what they're going to do is to continue to address the argument from
[02:04:10.420 --> 02:04:14.820]  now on more or less exclusively to the governing class
[02:04:14.820 --> 02:04:18.580]  the people who are doing this are no longer going to try to get the support
[02:04:18.580 --> 02:04:22.020]  of the public they know that we have won the argument as far as the public
[02:04:22.020 --> 02:04:26.340]  concert the general public no longer buys global warming period
[02:04:26.340 --> 02:04:29.700]  they've had enough of it they don't want to be bored with it anymore
[02:04:29.700 --> 02:04:34.100]  you'll see it less and less often now in even the most extreme left-wing media
[02:04:34.100 --> 02:04:38.020]  they're just all realizing the public are simply tired
[02:04:38.020 --> 02:04:42.660]  of hearing people crying wolf so they're now addressing themselves
[02:04:42.660 --> 02:04:46.980]  very quietly and very furtively and very invisibly
[02:04:46.980 --> 02:04:51.380]  to the governing class worldwide i've just come back from bon for instance
[02:04:51.380 --> 02:04:54.660]  where there's yet another conference in preparation for the
[02:04:54.660 --> 02:04:58.900]  cancun climate change treaty which will be
[02:04:58.900 --> 02:05:02.420]  the next step in the in the road towards world government
[02:05:02.420 --> 02:05:06.980]  unelected world government of course and it was quite clear what was going on
[02:05:06.980 --> 02:05:11.300]  there the u.n officials and the the odd scientists murmuring into the ears of
[02:05:11.300 --> 02:05:14.900]  international delegates one by one to persuade them this is all
[02:05:14.900 --> 02:05:18.100]  absolutely terrible of course i was there too murmuring into the other
[02:05:18.100 --> 02:05:21.700]  area of the delegates and interestingly this time around
[02:05:21.700 --> 02:05:25.300]  for instance a delegate from a leading southern african country
[02:05:25.300 --> 02:05:29.540]  when i said to him now the trouble is even if the u.n's right on the science
[02:05:29.540 --> 02:05:33.220]  economically that the stupidest possible way to do with this
[02:05:33.220 --> 02:05:36.660]  is interfering in the right of countries particularly poor countries
[02:05:36.660 --> 02:05:40.260]  to emit as much carbon dioxide by using fossil fuels as they need to lift their
[02:05:40.260 --> 02:05:43.620]  people out of poverty he said why have you chosen to speak to me i thought i'd
[02:05:43.620 --> 02:05:46.180]  speak to all sorts of delegates you're just the next one of us
[02:05:46.180 --> 02:05:49.940]  he said well i've been saying exactly what you're saying you're so right
[02:05:49.940 --> 02:05:54.500]  the idea of trying to curb co2 we all know our own scientists tells
[02:05:54.500 --> 02:05:57.540]  it makes no difference to the climate he said the thing that makes the
[02:05:57.540 --> 02:06:01.140]  difference is to adapt to any climate change that might result in whatever
[02:06:01.140 --> 02:06:05.300]  direction it might result as and when we need to he said that's going to be so
[02:06:05.300 --> 02:06:08.580]  much cheaper and more efficient and of course that's the correct point
[02:06:08.580 --> 02:06:11.940]  well look at the sun right now they're now saying that well look at the sun
[02:06:11.940 --> 02:06:15.780]  right now first it heated up now it's cooling off now nasa says
[02:06:15.780 --> 02:06:19.380]  they believe from their studies of course they can't know a hundred percent
[02:06:19.380 --> 02:06:23.380]  that it's about to go wild what does suv's
[02:06:23.380 --> 02:06:28.180]  or a family having a high calorie diet have to do with the sun
[02:06:28.180 --> 02:06:32.100]  well of course nothing whatever this is just more scare stories it's very
[02:06:32.100 --> 02:06:34.580]  difficult to tell which way the sun is going to go next
[02:06:34.580 --> 02:06:38.340]  we simply don't know enough about it and to try to pretend otherwise
[02:06:38.340 --> 02:06:41.940]  is futile it did go through a very quiet period for three years
[02:06:41.940 --> 02:06:46.660]  now it seems to be quite agitated again but whether it stays agitated or not
[02:06:46.660 --> 02:06:49.380]  or just collapses back at the quietude in a few years time
[02:06:49.380 --> 02:06:53.380]  it's anybody's guess right nobody is able to predict yet
[02:06:53.380 --> 02:06:56.980]  which way the sun is going to go if you look at the forecast from the leading
[02:06:56.980 --> 02:07:00.020]  solar physicist they're all over the place they don't disagree they don't
[02:07:00.020 --> 02:07:04.580]  agree with one another yet again there is no consensus because there can't be
[02:07:04.580 --> 02:07:08.420]  because our information on just about every aspect of the climate
[02:07:08.420 --> 02:07:14.020]  is so woefully incomplete it's incredible the tireless christopher
[02:07:14.020 --> 02:07:20.020]  montan joins us i now want to get into bp off air i asked
[02:07:20.020 --> 02:07:23.620]  your view on bp and it was basically very similar to mine
[02:07:23.620 --> 02:07:28.420]  and what the majority of americans are saying when they call and talk radio in
[02:07:28.420 --> 02:07:33.220]  polls but i mean it's still incredible to have a video
[02:07:33.220 --> 02:07:39.140]  of senator kyle this week saying obama told him behind closed doors
[02:07:39.140 --> 02:07:43.140]  he's leaving the border open 20 plus thousand dead just mexico's collapsed
[02:07:43.140 --> 02:07:47.860]  officially yeah so that everyone is terrorized
[02:07:47.860 --> 02:07:52.340]  into just granting them amnesty that's a form of terrorism of holding a sausage
[02:07:52.340 --> 02:07:55.860]  and that's what senator kyle said that he admitted he's holding a sausage
[02:07:55.860 --> 02:08:00.500]  same thing on the oil and and very early on i've warned people because i know
[02:08:00.500 --> 02:08:03.620]  they're mo that they were blocking the berms
[02:08:03.620 --> 02:08:06.820]  blocking the barges not taking the dutch or the
[02:08:06.820 --> 02:08:09.940]  norwegian giant tankers that can scoop it all up
[02:08:09.940 --> 02:08:13.140]  if they would have been allowed to go there early now it's spread out
[02:08:13.140 --> 02:08:16.660]  and still it's in the news every day where they won't let people block the
[02:08:16.660 --> 02:08:19.540]  estuaries they won't let them put the berms up
[02:08:19.540 --> 02:08:23.620]  and obama came out and said cap and trade is the answer
[02:08:23.620 --> 02:08:29.780]  i mean this is this is terrorism they are allowing it to get worse it is it is a
[02:08:29.780 --> 02:08:33.940]  false flag in that in that they are blocking any real
[02:08:33.940 --> 02:08:37.860]  relief that i mean it is very strange that the
[02:08:37.860 --> 02:08:41.620]  various methods that are available to bring this to an end very quickly are
[02:08:41.620 --> 02:08:45.540]  not being adopted particularly the use of super tankers with
[02:08:45.540 --> 02:08:49.540]  with the enormous pumps that they have on board they can just go along
[02:08:49.540 --> 02:08:53.300]  literally vacuuming this stuff off the surface of the ocean
[02:08:53.300 --> 02:08:56.260]  and you can run it once you've taken it out with a pump you can run it through
[02:08:56.260 --> 02:09:00.020]  what's called a centrifuge which will separate out the seawater
[02:09:00.020 --> 02:09:03.140]  and leave you with the crude oil which you then put straight into the tanks
[02:09:03.140 --> 02:09:05.860]  and then you take it along to the refinery it's perfectly good oil
[02:09:05.860 --> 02:09:09.300]  nothing wrong with it oil and water don't mix all you want to do is separate
[02:09:09.300 --> 02:09:12.660]  them by a centrifuge and you you can use the oil and put the water back at the
[02:09:12.660 --> 02:09:15.940]  sea and they're not doing it they're not doing
[02:09:15.940 --> 02:09:19.700]  it because i think obama wanted to do what the
[02:09:19.700 --> 02:09:23.140]  left often do they want to teach the oil industry a lesson
[02:09:23.140 --> 02:09:27.060]  and say well you've made this mess we're not going to allow it to be cleaned up
[02:09:27.060 --> 02:09:31.060]  so that everybody sees what a big mess it is now that may sound
[02:09:31.060 --> 02:09:34.820]  a little bit extreme but look at it this way
[02:09:34.820 --> 02:09:38.420]  there are methods they could have used to put an end to this
[02:09:38.420 --> 02:09:42.420]  a long time ago there are methods they could certainly be using to protect the
[02:09:42.420 --> 02:09:45.780]  estuary to protect the shoreline and yet
[02:09:45.780 --> 02:09:48.900]  somehow quite a lot of it that ought to be happening
[02:09:48.900 --> 02:09:52.100]  isn't happening and and you know there are stories emerging from all the way
[02:09:52.100 --> 02:09:56.100]  along the coastline that the obvious measures are not being taken out to
[02:09:56.100 --> 02:09:58.500]  some extent this may be just members of the public
[02:09:58.500 --> 02:10:01.860]  thinking things can be done no they're blocking them no they're blocking them
[02:10:01.860 --> 02:10:05.540]  that is the thing there seems to be an actual obstruction
[02:10:05.540 --> 02:10:09.780]  and again one has to put the other side and say maybe there are operational
[02:10:09.780 --> 02:10:12.980]  reasons but i'll tell you this for free i don't think
[02:10:12.980 --> 02:10:18.740]  that we are being let into the secret of how this is being run or why it's being
[02:10:18.740 --> 02:10:21.780]  run the way it is and again in a democracy call me old
[02:10:21.780 --> 02:10:24.260]  fashion but i think when something like this happens
[02:10:24.260 --> 02:10:29.460]  there should be daily briefings in detail about what is being done and what is
[02:10:29.460 --> 02:10:32.420]  not being done and why it is or is not being done
[02:10:32.420 --> 02:10:36.340]  and i don't think we're getting the frankness not so much from BP
[02:10:36.340 --> 02:10:40.740]  as from Obama and his administration as i would expect in a democracy
[02:10:40.740 --> 02:10:44.260]  and part of the reason for this is that the mainstream media of course are all
[02:10:44.260 --> 02:10:47.860]  rooting for Obama and they don't want to bring their hero down
[02:10:47.860 --> 02:10:52.100]  by showing how useless he is at the crisis or as it may be
[02:10:52.100 --> 02:10:55.380]  how much he's trying to exploit the crisis now i i hesitate to say that
[02:10:55.380 --> 02:11:00.100]  that is what he is trying to do but i am unhappy at the course of events
[02:11:00.100 --> 02:11:02.660]  and it certainly raises that question in one's mind
[02:11:02.660 --> 02:11:05.860]  well lord mongton i mean i don't know if you probably haven't seen the video but
[02:11:05.860 --> 02:11:10.420]  it's got hundreds of thousands of years senator kyle is also put out a statement
[02:11:10.420 --> 02:11:13.860]  that yes he was in a meeting with obama and obama said i'm not going to stop the
[02:11:13.860 --> 02:11:16.340]  crime i'm not going to put troops down there
[02:11:16.340 --> 02:11:21.380]  that we have foreigners they've shut down national parks 80 and 100 miles into
[02:11:21.380 --> 02:11:26.740]  arizona i mean it is warzone bedlam and obama said i like that
[02:11:26.740 --> 02:11:31.060]  i want that to continue so i get amnesty i mean he told a senator this
[02:11:31.060 --> 02:11:36.420]  and we know the chief of staff manuel says on wall street journal television
[02:11:36.420 --> 02:11:40.900]  don't let a good crisis go to waste so this is their modus operandi it i mean
[02:11:40.900 --> 02:11:44.820]  this is what they do well it's certainly worrying and i would
[02:11:44.820 --> 02:11:48.820]  think that if president obama actually said to the senator what the senator
[02:11:48.820 --> 02:11:52.340]  reports him as having said and again i was there so i don't know whether it was
[02:11:52.340 --> 02:11:56.020]  true but i have no reason to suppose the senator isn't telling the truth
[02:11:56.020 --> 02:12:01.300]  then i think there's certainly a stateable case that obama is has committed
[02:12:01.300 --> 02:12:05.060]  high treason and should be removed from office immediately
[02:12:05.060 --> 02:12:08.180]  if he is actually saying right we're going to let the borders down and let
[02:12:08.180 --> 02:12:12.020]  everybody come pouring in knowing that there are laws in place and people in
[02:12:12.020 --> 02:12:15.940]  place that are supposed to stop that happening if he wants to change the law
[02:12:15.940 --> 02:12:19.300]  on immigration he has to go to congress to do it
[02:12:19.300 --> 02:12:22.580]  he can't do that by executive order and if he tries
[02:12:22.580 --> 02:12:25.860]  he'll have to he'll have to resign but it's even more than that kyle said he
[02:12:25.860 --> 02:12:30.340]  was in the meeting and obama said we we're not gonna let this crisis go away
[02:12:30.340 --> 02:12:34.340]  the murder i mean it's it's i mean mexico is a failed state i'm sure you've
[02:12:34.340 --> 02:12:37.860]  seen 22 i mean it's a tragedy what's been going on there
[02:12:37.860 --> 02:12:42.020]  um and of course people want to to escape it and they want to escape to their
[02:12:42.020 --> 02:12:44.740]  their kindlier neighbor to the north all of that
[02:12:44.740 --> 02:12:47.700]  one understands and and indeed one sympathizes
[02:12:47.700 --> 02:12:54.340]  but uh it is not for the president to uh make executive orders nullifying
[02:12:54.340 --> 02:12:58.100]  acts of congress indeed it's against the constitution for him to do absolutely
[02:12:58.100 --> 02:13:02.500]  we're running out of time and uh the one of the biggest subjects is how their
[02:13:02.500 --> 02:13:06.420]  counters striking at you it really is the i mean now
[02:13:06.420 --> 02:13:10.260]  who's come to the fore as you know the leader of the anti
[02:13:10.260 --> 02:13:14.580]  man-made global warming uh fraud uh and so we're going to go to break but you've
[02:13:14.580 --> 02:13:17.300]  got about two minutes down that we'll come back in the final segment
[02:13:17.300 --> 02:13:20.340]  uh and have you go over this breakdown their latest
[02:13:20.340 --> 02:13:24.980]  uh manufactured assault on you lord montan right eight months ago i made a
[02:13:24.980 --> 02:13:30.740]  rather well-known speech in st paul minnesota to a businessman's audience
[02:13:30.740 --> 02:13:34.580]  to the minnesota free market institute in which i explained
[02:13:34.580 --> 02:13:38.020]  my doubts about the science of climate change and economics
[02:13:38.020 --> 02:13:42.100]  and also i tacked on a four-minute segment which has been very widely viewed i
[02:13:42.100 --> 02:13:44.820]  think two and a half million people on the main website and another two and a
[02:13:44.820 --> 02:13:47.700]  half million scattered over the internet have seen this peroration
[02:13:47.700 --> 02:13:51.460]  where i set out the world government plans of the un quoting from the actual
[02:13:51.460 --> 02:13:54.260]  treaty draft of september the 15th last year treated
[02:13:54.260 --> 02:13:56.740]  draft for copenhagen which failed i'm glad to say
[02:13:56.740 --> 02:14:00.260]  but uh that speech has attracted so much attention
[02:14:00.260 --> 02:14:04.100]  that whoever it is that's behind this global warming scare seems to have
[02:14:04.100 --> 02:14:08.500]  decided that they wanted me to be personally discredited
[02:14:08.500 --> 02:14:12.980]  because of that particular speech and so a professor at a bible college in
[02:14:12.980 --> 02:14:15.940]  minnesota called the thomas university a professor
[02:14:15.940 --> 02:14:20.260]  abraham who is not even a climate scientist a professor of fluid mechanics
[02:14:20.260 --> 02:14:23.540]  or something um in the engineering department
[02:14:23.540 --> 02:14:30.100]  decided to do an 83 minute show uh slideshow with uh him talking over 150
[02:14:30.100 --> 02:14:34.420]  in slides which he's put out all over the internet and all the climate extremist
[02:14:34.420 --> 02:14:38.580]  websites are running it uh basically saying that everything i said was
[02:14:38.580 --> 02:14:42.660]  nonsense from start to finish and it's very detailed and it's very vicious
[02:14:42.660 --> 02:14:45.780]  you know he accuses me of misrepresentation of making stuff
[02:14:45.780 --> 02:14:48.900]  lord montan when we come back and and maybe i twist your arm unless you have
[02:14:48.900 --> 02:14:51.700]  another show coming up for five minutes to the next hour so you
[02:14:51.700 --> 02:14:54.900]  so you have 10 minutes i'm gonna try to give you the floor because you've got
[02:14:54.900 --> 02:14:58.660]  this big paper coming out that we'll post at info wars dot com as soon as it's
[02:14:58.660 --> 02:15:03.860]  out where you go through and just document the straw man baloney
[02:15:03.860 --> 02:15:07.220]  lord christopher montan's our guest i'm alex jones
[02:15:07.220 --> 02:15:21.620]  before you slip into unconsciousness i'd like to have another kiss
[02:15:21.620 --> 02:15:29.540]  um
[02:15:29.540 --> 02:15:32.420]  science and public policy don or gives the website lord montan in the
[02:15:32.420 --> 02:15:36.900]  interest of time uh go through this assault
[02:15:36.900 --> 02:15:39.700]  because it's another example of understanding their tactics and we can
[02:15:39.700 --> 02:15:43.940]  actually use their assaults to illustrate uh the deception
[02:15:43.940 --> 02:15:46.900]  uh and it can be quite informative so you've got the floor break down what
[02:15:46.900 --> 02:15:49.940]  happened well thank you very much yes uh professor abraham
[02:15:49.940 --> 02:15:54.420]  from the saint thomas bible college in uh minnesota
[02:15:54.420 --> 02:15:58.020]  decided that he would produce this uh very long
[02:15:58.020 --> 02:16:02.420]  83 minutes with 115 slides attempt at a rebattle
[02:16:02.420 --> 02:16:06.660]  of my talk in saint thomas uh in uh st paul minnesota
[02:16:06.660 --> 02:16:10.340]  eight months ago which has gone viral all over the web
[02:16:10.340 --> 02:16:14.420]  and he wanted to tear this down because i don't know whether he's working with
[02:16:14.420 --> 02:16:18.180]  the people who are driving the scare who try to discredit anyone who dares to
[02:16:18.180 --> 02:16:21.620]  suggest there might be another side story or whether he did it on his own back
[02:16:21.620 --> 02:16:27.380]  i don't know however i wrote to him uh about two weeks ago and i said look
[02:16:27.380 --> 02:16:31.860]  here are several hundred questions about what you've said
[02:16:31.860 --> 02:16:37.620]  questions about why you have misstated what i said passed on those
[02:16:37.620 --> 02:16:42.420]  misstatements to scientists elsewhere got them to attack the misstatements
[02:16:42.420 --> 02:16:46.580]  and then printed their attacks on me as though they were attacking my words and
[02:16:46.580 --> 02:16:50.180]  not his words and they've done he's also got his own
[02:16:50.180 --> 02:16:53.700]  mathematics wrong he doesn't know any of the science of climate change
[02:16:53.700 --> 02:16:56.980]  and all of that he says you know i'm the professor here mungtons of layman he
[02:16:56.980 --> 02:17:00.180]  doesn't know what he's talking about he's paid by the denialist industry he's
[02:17:00.180 --> 02:17:03.700]  paid by fossil fuel industries which i'm not but that's what he says
[02:17:03.700 --> 02:17:06.740]  the whole thing is lies from start to finish what's interesting about this
[02:17:06.740 --> 02:17:11.220]  one though is that uh i have provided an unusually
[02:17:11.220 --> 02:17:16.100]  detailed refutation point by point of every single one of the
[02:17:16.100 --> 02:17:20.740]  several hundred lies and i mean several hundred deliberate falsehoods
[02:17:20.740 --> 02:17:24.580]  that abraham has perpetrated this man is a liar
[02:17:24.580 --> 02:17:27.940]  a cheat i mean he makes al goh look like a saint
[02:17:27.940 --> 02:17:32.820]  he's utterly utterly corrupt that is not a man who deserves to hold any
[02:17:32.820 --> 02:17:38.180]  academic office whatsoever and what he did was deliberately to
[02:17:38.180 --> 02:17:41.780]  divorce his talk from mine so that unless you were watching my talk at the
[02:17:41.780 --> 02:17:44.900]  same time as his you wouldn't realize how clever his
[02:17:44.900 --> 02:17:47.860]  lies were it took him months to put this together
[02:17:47.860 --> 02:17:51.620]  and it took me a week to write him an 84 page letter
[02:17:51.620 --> 02:17:55.220]  with several hundred i think it's 450 questions in it
[02:17:55.220 --> 02:17:58.660]  and it's that letter which i'm going to let you have on your website in a few
[02:17:58.660 --> 02:18:02.740]  days time i'm going to let him have one more chance because i'm very fair to
[02:18:02.740 --> 02:18:06.420]  people when they do this sort of thing to reply properly but so far
[02:18:06.420 --> 02:18:09.780]  his reply says nothing more than the following
[02:18:09.780 --> 02:18:14.500]  this is my 84 page letter that i sent to me says i'm replying to your letter
[02:18:14.500 --> 02:18:17.540]  on behalf of myself and on behalf of father dennis
[02:18:17.540 --> 02:18:20.980]  beef who is the president of the university who might also written
[02:18:20.980 --> 02:18:25.380]  complaining about abraham and asking for him to be investigated
[02:18:25.380 --> 02:18:30.420]  and uh father dennis beef is washing his hands a bit just like punctious pilot
[02:18:30.420 --> 02:18:34.500]  and the university therefore is not going to investigate any of this
[02:18:34.500 --> 02:18:38.260]  and abraham simply says i stand by my original position
[02:18:38.260 --> 02:18:42.180]  so let's have a look at abraham's original position the first thing that
[02:18:42.180 --> 02:18:45.300]  struck me as odd is that he didn't even tell me he was doing this in eight
[02:18:45.300 --> 02:18:48.660]  months time and time again in his attack on me he says well
[02:18:48.660 --> 02:18:52.260]  he doesn't even tell us what his sources are at no time did he lift the phone or
[02:18:52.260 --> 02:18:54.900]  send me an email and ask me what my sources were
[02:18:54.900 --> 02:18:59.300]  that's what an academic would normally do so there's clear bad faith there
[02:18:59.300 --> 02:19:05.460]  bad faith also in abraham's failure to let me know he was going to do this
[02:19:05.460 --> 02:19:08.740]  before he published it so that i would have the chance to publish
[02:19:08.740 --> 02:19:12.980]  a contemporaneous and detailed refutation no he wanted to get a clear
[02:19:12.980 --> 02:19:15.780]  run of it so that he could get all the left-wing
[02:19:15.780 --> 02:19:20.180]  websites to to tear down my reputation other than the newspaper blogs over
[02:19:20.180 --> 02:19:23.780]  here saying i am the fallen idol of the climate skeptics this kind of thing
[02:19:23.780 --> 02:19:28.500]  there was also malice i mean the but they always do those hoaxes they always
[02:19:28.500 --> 02:19:31.300]  say yeah i mean they just i mean they've
[02:19:31.300 --> 02:19:34.020]  said that the ice caps completely melted i mean they
[02:19:34.020 --> 02:19:38.500]  hold a thing and what he says is he says you know uh this man is guilty of slight of hand
[02:19:38.500 --> 02:19:41.940]  fabrication uh shady well stay there back in one minute lord
[02:19:41.940 --> 02:19:47.620]  montan yeah stay back uh stay there till we come back
[02:19:54.340 --> 02:19:58.260]  we are now in the hour number four on this thursday edition lord montan will
[02:19:58.260 --> 02:20:01.300]  be with us about 15 after because it's important to be able to finish what he
[02:20:01.300 --> 02:20:04.900]  was covering recapping for stations who just joined us
[02:20:04.900 --> 02:20:08.900]  they had a university professor hydrologist i guess
[02:20:08.900 --> 02:20:12.980]  write this straw man attack they got a lot of um collectivist
[02:20:12.980 --> 02:20:16.500]  uh parasite coverage saying that he'd been
[02:20:16.500 --> 02:20:20.820]  discredited but then when you look at the the slideshow
[02:20:20.820 --> 02:20:24.340]  none of it is what lord christopher montan has ever said at science and
[02:20:24.340 --> 02:20:27.860]  public policy dot org and when he talks about world
[02:20:27.860 --> 02:20:30.180]  government being announced that's all over the news
[02:20:30.180 --> 02:20:33.860]  so lord montan in this segment the next you've got the floor
[02:20:33.860 --> 02:20:37.700]  run through the straw man attack he used the tactics he used
[02:20:37.700 --> 02:20:41.780]  right so first of all we've dealt with bad faith where he didn't tell me he was
[02:20:41.780 --> 02:20:45.780]  doing this and the the absolute academic rule if you're going to attack
[02:20:45.780 --> 02:20:49.220]  somebody particularly by accusing him of misrepresentation
[02:20:49.220 --> 02:20:54.180]  and dodgy data and and straw men and slice of hand and other things he's
[02:20:54.180 --> 02:20:58.740]  held at me then it's very important you let the the the person know you're
[02:20:58.740 --> 02:21:01.060]  going to do this so that he can mount a reply
[02:21:01.060 --> 02:21:04.100]  at more or less the same time that he didn't do
[02:21:04.100 --> 02:21:08.260]  and that on its own would be an offense for which he would be dismissed from a
[02:21:08.260 --> 02:21:11.460]  real university but then he only belongs to this
[02:21:11.460 --> 02:21:14.980]  half-assed catholic bible college whose president
[02:21:14.980 --> 02:21:20.260]  father dennis j d whose email address is djdease
[02:21:20.260 --> 02:21:26.820]  at st thomas dot edu that's djdease at st thomas
[02:21:26.820 --> 02:21:32.020]  dot edu and now the honor of lord montan is in question i i dare say
[02:21:32.020 --> 02:21:36.420]  i want everyone who is listening to that take that email address down and
[02:21:36.420 --> 02:21:41.860]  write to father d telling him that he must investigate the matters i have
[02:21:41.860 --> 02:21:45.300]  drawn to his attention but doesn't he know that you've i mean to interrupt but
[02:21:45.300 --> 02:21:48.660]  i want you to get into that you've routed all these other fraudulent
[02:21:48.660 --> 02:21:51.140]  professors and that he's picked a fight with a
[02:21:51.140 --> 02:21:55.140]  quite large dragon i don't think he's realized yet
[02:21:55.140 --> 02:21:59.060]  i think he thinks he can get away with this but i'm already talking to some
[02:21:59.060 --> 02:22:02.900]  of the university's largest funders and they are going to start cutting off
[02:22:02.900 --> 02:22:06.500]  funding unless he gets on and gets off his bottom and does his job as president
[02:22:06.500 --> 02:22:10.100]  of the university and has this man abraham hold up in front of a
[02:22:10.100 --> 02:22:14.180]  committee of his peers to examine whether or not i am telling the truth or he
[02:22:14.180 --> 02:22:16.500]  is telling the truth okay well let's go through the laundry list let's get to
[02:22:16.500 --> 02:22:19.940]  go all right let's have a look at what he does first of all he says i'm the
[02:22:19.940 --> 02:22:23.380]  professor here montan's a layman being paid by
[02:22:23.380 --> 02:22:28.260]  fossil fuel interest well no i'm not i received no payment whatsoever
[02:22:28.260 --> 02:22:31.940]  for my talk at st paul minnesota the one that he's attacking before
[02:22:31.940 --> 02:22:35.300]  i don't receive any payment from fossil fuel interest
[02:22:35.300 --> 02:22:41.460]  and all of that was simply a lie uh but apparently in this bible college lying
[02:22:41.460 --> 02:22:45.140]  is part of what they regard as their christian mission i've already written
[02:22:45.140 --> 02:22:48.020]  to the bishop about it but of course the bishop likewise these days
[02:22:48.020 --> 02:22:50.980]  probably so busy sorting out the problems with little boys that he hasn't
[02:22:50.980 --> 02:22:54.340]  got time to deal with this one i haven't had a reply from the bishop
[02:22:54.340 --> 02:22:59.700]  um but abraham starts off by uh he can't even get his own math
[02:22:59.700 --> 02:23:04.340]  right time and time again he gets his sums wrong and then blames me
[02:23:04.340 --> 02:23:08.180]  then he tells the main thing that's that's really serious about it is lie
[02:23:08.180 --> 02:23:13.220]  after lie after lie after lie what he does is he keeps on saying that i've
[02:23:13.220 --> 02:23:18.100]  said things about work by scientists which i haven't in fact said he then
[02:23:18.100 --> 02:23:21.460]  gets on to the scientist because i said monkton said this about you what do you
[02:23:21.460 --> 02:23:24.820]  think of that the scientist said that guy monkton's absolutely terrible i never
[02:23:24.820 --> 02:23:28.500]  said anything of the kind and then he repeats that in his talk
[02:23:28.500 --> 02:23:33.060]  and he has an example he falsely led this is abraham this pretty little man from
[02:23:33.060 --> 02:23:36.660]  support minnesota falsely led a third party scientist david hathaway who's a
[02:23:36.660 --> 02:23:41.140]  solar physicist to believe that i had misrepresented hathaway as having
[02:23:41.140 --> 02:23:46.340]  suggested that variations in the sun play a dominant role in climate
[02:23:46.340 --> 02:23:49.700]  which you've never said that you've just said that you just said it's known to be
[02:23:49.700 --> 02:23:53.140]  a you ever said it i absolutely never because i've interviewed you well hold
[02:23:53.140 --> 02:23:55.540]  on hold on i want to back i'm never interviewed you you probably
[02:23:55.540 --> 02:24:00.420]  15 20 times i've read most your stuff yeah you're always saying no one knows
[02:24:00.420 --> 02:24:04.260]  about the climate and for them to claim that they know when it's so complex as
[02:24:04.260 --> 02:24:07.780]  asinine and but but i mean this is so egregious to go get
[02:24:07.780 --> 02:24:12.660]  other preeminent people to attack you by misrepresenting your words this is
[02:24:12.660 --> 02:24:16.980]  not what he's done it's outrageous and abraham knew
[02:24:16.980 --> 02:24:19.780]  that i had not in this talk that he said he was
[02:24:19.780 --> 02:24:23.620]  attacking i had not cited any opinion of hathaway
[02:24:23.620 --> 02:24:29.540]  whatsoever i had shown a graph by him i had drawn my own conclusion from that
[02:24:29.540 --> 02:24:33.380]  graph not in any way attributing my conclusion to hathaway
[02:24:33.380 --> 02:24:37.780]  and i had then cited the conclusion of an eminent
[02:24:37.780 --> 02:24:41.460]  pair of scientists cafeta and west to the effect that two-thirds of
[02:24:41.460 --> 02:24:45.060]  the recent level warming was solar that was not stay there stay there stay
[02:24:45.060 --> 02:24:48.260]  there we're coming right back
[02:24:48.900 --> 02:24:56.820]  ease the t-rex of political talk alex jones on the gcm radio network
[02:24:56.820 --> 02:25:01.220]  now we're now eight minutes into this fourth and final hour today i'll be
[02:25:01.220 --> 02:25:05.220]  back of course tomorrow 11 a.m to 3 p.m central 12 9 to 4 p.m eastern
[02:25:05.220 --> 02:25:08.580]  back sunday live 4 to 6 p.m abbreviated sunday broadcast
[02:25:08.580 --> 02:25:11.700]  there's so much news and information we're going to cover news and take your
[02:25:11.700 --> 02:25:13.780]  calls if your lord christopher montan leaves us
[02:25:13.780 --> 02:25:17.140]  jack mclam is popping in about the bp situation as well
[02:25:17.140 --> 02:25:20.820]  lord montan um we've got an 80-plus page
[02:25:20.820 --> 02:25:24.660]  uh breakdown that you sent him two weeks ago he won't respond
[02:25:24.660 --> 02:25:27.620]  and so i guess you're starting an opening salvo here you said in the next
[02:25:27.620 --> 02:25:31.940]  few days one more chance you're going to publish it we're going to put it up on
[02:25:31.940 --> 02:25:36.260]  info wars dot com and and and i understand you're flabbergasted
[02:25:36.260 --> 02:25:41.380]  by uh just the complete fabrication but sometimes they say hitler said the
[02:25:41.380 --> 02:25:44.340]  bigger the lie the more they'll believe it but also the bigger the lie the
[02:25:44.340 --> 02:25:47.940]  faster it'll fall so just run over some of the other deceptions
[02:25:47.940 --> 02:25:51.700]  let's just take one example he said that i had misrepresented
[02:25:51.700 --> 02:25:56.420]  the work of dr david david barba who's a climate researcher
[02:25:56.420 --> 02:26:00.180]  now there's just one problem with that i had not cited
[02:26:00.180 --> 02:26:05.380]  that researchers work at any point in my talk nor indeed have i ever done so
[02:26:05.380 --> 02:26:10.020]  he just made it up then he did he said that i had
[02:26:10.020 --> 02:26:15.300]  conducted and then misrepresented the results of a google scholar search for
[02:26:15.300 --> 02:26:18.100]  scientific papers containing all the words global
[02:26:18.100 --> 02:26:22.580]  climate and change between 2004 and 2007
[02:26:22.580 --> 02:26:25.940]  abraham also alleged that the quantity of scientific papers retrieved in the
[02:26:25.940 --> 02:26:29.940]  search i said it was 539 had been a complete
[02:26:29.940 --> 02:26:34.660]  fabrication he's accusing me of a lie uh because he says there were there were
[02:26:34.660 --> 02:26:40.020]  far more than that now abraham knew when he get when he said his lie
[02:26:40.020 --> 02:26:44.020]  because i had said so in the talk he was commenting on and made clear in the
[02:26:44.020 --> 02:26:48.020]  relevant slide that the search hadn't been done by me
[02:26:48.020 --> 02:26:52.820]  it had been done by uh clas martin schulte a very distinguished researcher
[02:26:52.820 --> 02:26:56.980]  mr schulte mr schulte's search results had been reported in 2006
[02:26:56.980 --> 02:27:00.740]  in a peer reviewed journal from which i had quite legitimately and accurately
[02:27:00.740 --> 02:27:05.380]  cited a key result the database searched was not google scholar
[02:27:05.380 --> 02:27:09.380]  but the isi web of science database the search was not for
[02:27:09.380 --> 02:27:13.620]  all of the words global climate and change but for the exact phrase
[02:27:13.620 --> 02:27:17.300]  global climate change because that phrase is a standard one used in searches
[02:27:17.300 --> 02:27:23.540]  of this kind the search period hadn't been 2004 to 2007 but 2004 to mid-february
[02:27:23.540 --> 02:27:27.460]  2007 which makes a difference the number of papers so basically he just made up
[02:27:27.460 --> 02:27:31.780]  whatever he wanted and that contrary to the allegation of complete fabrication
[02:27:31.780 --> 02:27:37.300]  mr schulte's search had indeed retrieved 539 scientific papers and not the
[02:27:37.300 --> 02:27:42.100]  several thousand that abraham's google scholar search had turned up on a
[02:27:42.100 --> 02:27:46.980]  completely different subject so he had got wrong the database we
[02:27:46.980 --> 02:27:50.980]  searched the search term we used the period over which the search was
[02:27:50.980 --> 02:27:56.020]  conducted everything uh that had been plainly and accurately
[02:27:56.020 --> 02:28:00.100]  stated in my talk he he just lies about it
[02:28:00.100 --> 02:28:03.780]  and then says that i am guilty of a complete fabrication
[02:28:03.780 --> 02:28:08.180]  well sir you know the british is even more intense
[02:28:08.180 --> 02:28:13.540]  stronger but under u.s law the definition of defamation libel or slander
[02:28:13.540 --> 02:28:18.260]  is premeditatedly manufacturing lies about someone
[02:28:18.260 --> 02:28:23.140]  to damage them and this this just from the preliminary here and it goes on and
[02:28:23.140 --> 02:28:26.500]  on sounds like it fits the very definition of that
[02:28:26.500 --> 02:28:30.100]  i mean i think we are going to be looking at a legal case
[02:28:30.100 --> 02:28:34.740]  if we we can't get a a any sense out of the president of the university who
[02:28:34.740 --> 02:28:38.660]  again if you're listening to this i want you to email this creeper for president
[02:28:38.660 --> 02:28:44.020]  father dennis j d that's dj dea s for sugar e
[02:28:44.020 --> 02:28:49.700]  at st thomas dot edu dj dea s for sugar e at
[02:28:49.700 --> 02:28:55.460]  st thomas dot edu and tell him to do his job this is an assault on you i mean
[02:28:55.460 --> 02:28:59.300]  this is an assault on you to to to create this scurrilous
[02:28:59.300 --> 02:29:03.220]  list of fiction and then say it's real i mean run through some more of it
[02:29:03.220 --> 02:29:07.220]  yes here's another one he said that i'd misrepresented the findings in a paper
[02:29:07.220 --> 02:29:12.180]  by dr leude keegwin now in fact i had merely reproduced a graph by
[02:29:12.180 --> 02:29:16.500]  dr keegwin showing that there was evidence that in that
[02:29:16.500 --> 02:29:21.380]  graph the medieval war period had been warmer than the president
[02:29:21.380 --> 02:29:26.020]  and um... but everyone admits that everyone admits
[02:29:26.020 --> 02:29:30.100]  that going back to the uh... maximum back in the start of the bronze age what
[02:29:30.100 --> 02:29:32.980]  eight thousand years ago that was going on i mean look
[02:29:32.980 --> 02:29:36.020]  the even the mainstream media admits you've been right about
[02:29:36.020 --> 02:29:39.700]  the cooling for nine years i mean you've overturned their entire fraud
[02:29:39.700 --> 02:29:44.660]  here's another wonderful one he abraham falsely represented me as having
[02:29:44.660 --> 02:29:48.740]  misrepresented the results of a paper by noon et al
[02:29:48.740 --> 02:29:53.380]  although abraham knew when he told this lie in his talk
[02:29:53.380 --> 02:29:57.860]  that i had correctly reproduced a graph from that paper
[02:29:57.860 --> 02:30:02.660]  which was about antarctica and abraham then also knew that a comment on the
[02:30:02.660 --> 02:30:06.740]  internet from one of the authors of the paper to the effect that the arctic is
[02:30:06.740 --> 02:30:10.500]  today warming rapidly had no bearing whatsoever on my use of a
[02:30:10.500 --> 02:30:13.300]  graph from that paper which was demonstrating the reality of the
[02:30:13.300 --> 02:30:16.580]  medieval war period in antarctica this guy
[02:30:16.580 --> 02:30:20.580]  abraham knows so little climate science he can't even tell the difference
[02:30:20.580 --> 02:30:25.300]  between the medieval war period of the president or the antarctic and the arctic
[02:30:25.300 --> 02:30:29.540]  that's how louis so he was he was floating around at thousand year
[02:30:29.540 --> 02:30:32.740]  multi-thousand year five hundred year intervals
[02:30:32.740 --> 02:30:37.140]  not even knowing where he was and not even knowing the difference exactly
[02:30:37.140 --> 02:30:40.260]  not even knowing the difference wait he didn't even know what the medieval
[02:30:40.260 --> 02:30:43.460]  warm period when they had grapes in england he doesn't appear to have
[02:30:43.460 --> 02:30:46.900]  understood that at all because i was citing a paper that was looking at
[02:30:46.900 --> 02:30:51.060]  that period he then gets hold of one of the authors and finds on their website
[02:30:51.060 --> 02:30:54.900]  a statement about the arctic today well that has nothing to do with the
[02:30:54.900 --> 02:30:59.220]  antarctic in the medieval warm period a thousand years ago the antarctic is is
[02:30:59.220 --> 02:31:02.980]  the southern and the arctics the north he didn't even know that he didn't even
[02:31:02.980 --> 02:31:07.300]  know that um and he stands excuse me my my six
[02:31:07.300 --> 02:31:10.980]  year old knows that lord mongdon that's right i wrote to him and i gave him a
[02:31:10.980 --> 02:31:14.660]  copy of of or at least the president of the university gave him a copy of my
[02:31:14.660 --> 02:31:18.420]  letter to the president of the university pointing that one out and he stands by
[02:31:18.420 --> 02:31:25.140]  his position that's what he says when he says i stand by my position he's
[02:31:25.140 --> 02:31:29.780]  standing by all these lies i'm sorry but that one blew me away
[02:31:29.780 --> 02:31:33.380]  he doesn't know i could go on and on and on and on there are so i mean there are
[02:31:33.380 --> 02:31:36.980]  literally hundreds of these and what i've done is i've done a very long
[02:31:36.980 --> 02:31:40.660]  letter it's 84 pages long to abraham himself
[02:31:40.660 --> 02:31:44.020]  which he hasn't replied to except to say he stands by his position
[02:31:44.020 --> 02:31:47.540]  he stands by all these lies even though it's plain and absurd that they're
[02:31:47.540 --> 02:31:50.100]  like it's quite clear that they're lies
[02:31:50.100 --> 02:31:54.260]  um and of course this discredits him utterly
[02:31:54.260 --> 02:31:58.020]  in the eyes of his colleagues in the eyes of academia generally
[02:31:58.020 --> 02:32:02.020]  and he's about to be made a big fool of and turn about fair play i mean you are
[02:32:02.020 --> 02:32:06.420]  a uh foreignable uh intellect if you've done your research i mean
[02:32:06.420 --> 02:32:09.780]  you're one of the few people who's going to be addressing the world federation
[02:32:09.780 --> 02:32:14.820]  of scientists who is a layman uh and i think this guy has no idea
[02:32:14.820 --> 02:32:19.060]  that he's got a tiger by the tail i i think he has every every idea of that
[02:32:19.060 --> 02:32:22.900]  now which is why he's he's i think on legal advice
[02:32:22.900 --> 02:32:26.580]  he's decided not to pick himself any further in you see if he admits he got it
[02:32:26.580 --> 02:32:29.460]  wrong i'd be willing to say fine admit you've
[02:32:29.460 --> 02:32:32.260]  got it wrong put up a you know take this now this is being
[02:32:32.260 --> 02:32:36.580]  broadcast on the university's web server and every slide has been imprinted
[02:32:36.580 --> 02:32:40.020]  no i know i saw it i saw it a few weeks ago and i've ignored it just
[02:32:40.020 --> 02:32:43.860]  because i mean i've seen the these people lie continually and yeah i mean
[02:32:43.860 --> 02:32:47.460]  the i mean he ought to get hired by reason why this one's interesting
[02:32:47.460 --> 02:32:50.500]  is that this is clearly a lot of money has been spent
[02:32:50.500 --> 02:32:54.340]  on this and it wasn't his money somebody has backed this
[02:32:54.340 --> 02:32:58.260]  and somebody has organized it and it's been very artfully done so if you first
[02:32:58.260 --> 02:33:01.300]  look at it oh my god what a complete lunatic monkey he doesn't know the
[02:33:01.300 --> 02:33:05.140]  first thing about anything it's only when you've seen my letter to
[02:33:05.140 --> 02:33:08.180]  abraham which just goes through it point by point by an
[02:33:08.180 --> 02:33:12.420]  exerable point that you see just what a liar this man is
[02:33:12.420 --> 02:33:17.300]  and just how very foolish the president of the university father djd
[02:33:17.300 --> 02:33:21.300]  is not to investigate the matter and if you're listening to this
[02:33:21.300 --> 02:33:26.260]  and you want to help out here and get the truth to be to register once again
[02:33:26.260 --> 02:33:32.100]  in academia then email djdeas for sugar at st
[02:33:32.100 --> 02:33:37.860]  thomas dot edu that sdthomas.edu well also lord
[02:33:37.860 --> 02:33:40.660]  monk didn't get a story out about this in the next few days and we'll put the
[02:33:40.660 --> 02:33:44.340]  phone numbers up there because because i know
[02:33:44.340 --> 02:33:48.020]  the standard of libel slander defamation because i'm a radio host
[02:33:48.020 --> 02:33:50.820]  yeah and when i first got into radio i had to you know sit there with lawyers
[02:33:50.820 --> 02:33:54.260]  and we taught all this uh in in in quite a few little classes
[02:33:54.260 --> 02:33:58.980]  yeah but the fact if their lawyers telling them to not retract
[02:33:58.980 --> 02:34:02.180]  their lawyers not telling them the right thing if they
[02:34:02.180 --> 02:34:05.700]  premeditatedly lied about you the only hope they've got
[02:34:05.700 --> 02:34:10.340]  is to reverse and apologize if they keep it out there
[02:34:10.340 --> 02:34:14.500]  uh they are going to be sunk well they are indeed and
[02:34:14.500 --> 02:34:17.860]  i'm just waiting to i'm giving them every chance because
[02:34:17.860 --> 02:34:21.220]  the courts don't like this to be a sort of political football
[02:34:21.220 --> 02:34:25.380]  so what i like to do is and because i i have had to sue for libel on two or three
[02:34:25.380 --> 02:34:28.980]  occasions before i've always succeeded i've never lost you set him a tort
[02:34:28.980 --> 02:34:32.100]  letter basically you're you're you know i haven't i haven't yet i mean that's
[02:34:32.100 --> 02:34:35.300]  what your letter is saying i have these questions i'd be grateful if you'd
[02:34:35.300 --> 02:34:38.260]  answer and in the meantime please take it off the web
[02:34:38.260 --> 02:34:42.500]  they haven't done that because what i'm doing is i'm creating a paper trail
[02:34:42.500 --> 02:34:45.700]  where the judge will look you say look i've behaved on the whole pretty
[02:34:45.700 --> 02:34:49.620]  reasonably uh the other side hasn't and if the other
[02:34:49.620 --> 02:34:54.420]  side in those circumstances had lied had had these lies
[02:34:54.420 --> 02:34:58.660]  fairly drawn to its attention had had a month to get these lies put straight
[02:34:58.660 --> 02:35:03.300]  and had simply refused to tackle it at all then that's the point at which the
[02:35:03.300 --> 02:35:07.940]  judge will award enormous damages now as you know under the freedom of
[02:35:07.940 --> 02:35:11.220]  speech convention uh the the constitutional amendment
[02:35:11.220 --> 02:35:15.460]  um you can say what you like about somebody but if you stray
[02:35:15.460 --> 02:35:20.820]  into fact and you state facts that are not true and then draw from those
[02:35:20.820 --> 02:35:24.420]  facts conclusion about somebody's character which are strongly adverse to
[02:35:24.420 --> 02:35:27.780]  that person that even in american law is libel
[02:35:27.780 --> 02:35:32.340]  look you can't say a public figure is a murderer if they're not
[02:35:32.340 --> 02:35:36.980]  that's right and uh this is this is much more serious than that because it's
[02:35:36.980 --> 02:35:40.100]  going to my professional reputation it's saying i've gone around the world
[02:35:40.100 --> 02:35:42.820]  making these speeches and essentially the whole thing's made up it's all
[02:35:42.820 --> 02:35:44.980]  nonsense i don't know what i'm talking about or where i do know what i talk
[02:35:44.980 --> 02:35:48.900]  about i'm lying if you can't get nastier than that
[02:35:48.900 --> 02:35:53.940]  and for him simply to refuse to answer my letter because he basically can't i mean
[02:35:53.940 --> 02:35:56.580]  it's an unanswerable letter as you'll see when you see it
[02:35:56.580 --> 02:36:01.060]  it's very detailed but it's very interesting it's actually worth
[02:36:01.060 --> 02:36:04.420]  dipping into it it's not a thing to be read in one go it's too long for that
[02:36:04.420 --> 02:36:08.420]  but it's worth just dipping into it and seeing the staggering
[02:36:08.420 --> 02:36:12.740]  dishonesty and i've got all the pictures of my slides and his slides and
[02:36:12.740 --> 02:36:16.980]  reply and his statements about me and then my questions to him
[02:36:16.980 --> 02:36:20.740]  about why he says the things he said and in those questions
[02:36:20.740 --> 02:36:23.940]  i convey the information that makes it very plain to the reader
[02:36:23.940 --> 02:36:28.020]  exactly how it is and how frequently he has simply lied
[02:36:28.020 --> 02:36:31.540]  all right lord mongton amazing we'll have to watch the aftermath of this
[02:36:31.540 --> 02:36:35.380]  we look forward to getting your paper and publishing it at info wars dot com
[02:36:35.380 --> 02:36:39.620]  keep up the great work your integrity has been proven in spades uh we are
[02:36:39.620 --> 02:36:43.220]  routing the enemy god bless you thank you very much and god bless you too and god
[02:36:43.220 --> 02:37:13.060]  bless america all right we'll be back
[02:37:13.220 --> 02:37:24.900]  we got jack mclean popping in with some key intel on bp
[02:37:24.900 --> 02:37:28.260]  i had a caller call me what two three days ago saying jack mclean's on his
[02:37:28.260 --> 02:37:32.100]  show on genesis saying he has sources he has a lot in the police and military
[02:37:32.100 --> 02:37:34.020]  because police and military is the new world order
[02:37:34.020 --> 02:37:38.900]  he's had for more than 25 years now saying that the
[02:37:38.900 --> 02:37:42.660]  bureau land management went on board and did an inspection and
[02:37:42.660 --> 02:37:45.540]  planted a bomb on it and blew it up i know that
[02:37:45.540 --> 02:37:49.460]  blm was there i know a strange unauthorized
[02:37:49.460 --> 02:37:53.540]  alteration was made that wasn't permitted and wasn't kosher
[02:37:53.540 --> 02:37:57.540]  now the word they used uh wasn't regulation and wasn't a standard part
[02:37:57.540 --> 02:38:01.060]  and then it happened and then i did a search on it and found some
[02:38:01.060 --> 02:38:05.380]  a guy with an oil company saying it i think zimmerman oil and and and some
[02:38:05.380 --> 02:38:10.020]  other sites saying it so we'll talk to him because i respect jack mclean
[02:38:10.020 --> 02:38:14.500]  uh and uh get his intel on that front right now let's go to michael taylor
[02:38:14.500 --> 02:38:17.860]  michael kate mason and others michael you're on the air
[02:38:17.860 --> 02:38:23.940]  from canada welcome michelle michelle i can't read i'm
[02:38:23.940 --> 02:38:28.260]  go ahead that's okay one of i know my name um just want to let you know i've
[02:38:28.260 --> 02:38:31.060]  been a subscriber to your site and listener for about three years my
[02:38:31.060 --> 02:38:34.820]  brother woke me up by uh saying the word bill de berg and one search led to
[02:38:34.820 --> 02:38:37.220]  another but anyway i'm looking forward to your chemtrail
[02:38:37.220 --> 02:38:40.980]  film too um i was hoping to speak to uh
[02:38:40.980 --> 02:38:45.780]  uh mr uh mongton but anyway it is about um
[02:38:45.780 --> 02:38:49.860]  the uh carbon uh credit and all that stuff
[02:38:49.860 --> 02:38:54.020]  in british columbia our trader provincial premier
[02:38:54.020 --> 02:38:58.500]  gordon cambell uh who was a an attendee at bill de berg this year with peter
[02:38:58.500 --> 02:39:01.940]  mansbridge arbor and so was so was general mccrystal by
[02:39:01.940 --> 02:39:05.540]  the way nice yes actually i read that this
[02:39:05.540 --> 02:39:09.940]  morning um anyways he imposed a provincial
[02:39:09.940 --> 02:39:13.780]  carbon tax on us uh about a year and a half ago or so
[02:39:13.780 --> 02:39:17.940]  now what i'm curious about is i i know that he may be up for um
[02:39:17.940 --> 02:39:21.540]  uh federal leadership uh going to bill de berg as did
[02:39:21.540 --> 02:39:25.300]  steven harper but what i'm interested in your take on this
[02:39:25.300 --> 02:39:31.140]  is what do you think his uh ultimate plan is other than that are they going
[02:39:31.140 --> 02:39:35.380]  to increase do you think the um carbon tax because this whole carbon
[02:39:35.380 --> 02:39:38.740]  thing and the recycling and the whole green movement is really sickening out
[02:39:38.740 --> 02:39:42.020]  here with all the tree hunters and everything we have right
[02:39:42.020 --> 02:39:47.060]  or do you think they're looking at a a federal carbon tax prior to um the
[02:39:47.060 --> 02:39:50.900]  global carbon tax and what let me tell you i mean it varies region to region i
[02:39:50.900 --> 02:39:54.820]  study this all the time but if i tell you specifically everything about canada
[02:39:54.820 --> 02:39:58.020]  you know more than i do though i i i read the canadian news
[02:39:58.020 --> 02:40:02.180]  i know that multiple states namely the one you're talking about
[02:40:02.180 --> 02:40:07.380]  uh did put this tax in locally that they are adding new gas taxes they are
[02:40:07.380 --> 02:40:11.380]  adding new home inspection rules the eu was announced that you won't be
[02:40:11.380 --> 02:40:15.540]  allowed to have single family dwellings period within nine years
[02:40:15.540 --> 02:40:18.740]  within six years they won't be able to be given new permits i mean this is
[02:40:18.740 --> 02:40:23.620]  this controls everything uh and so take austin
[02:40:23.620 --> 02:40:28.580]  they can't get the congress to pass it uh even with their oil spill so obama
[02:40:28.580 --> 02:40:33.220]  says he's just going to implement it by executive order uh in austin the city
[02:40:33.220 --> 02:40:38.500]  council uh has gotten a u n award i mean was in the u n announced on the floor
[02:40:38.500 --> 02:40:43.700]  two months ago praising austin when they passed 2.6 billion in taxes on us
[02:40:43.700 --> 02:40:48.420]  has nothing to do they just say it's green your power bill went up it's green
[02:40:48.420 --> 02:40:51.460]  uh so they're going to rape us every angle they can
[02:40:51.460 --> 02:40:56.820]  uh tracker boxes in our cars that taxes england's already starting it
[02:40:56.820 --> 02:41:00.340]  texas is already paying drivers to be part of a test program to do it
[02:41:00.340 --> 02:41:04.020]  so i mean they're just gonna the sky's the limit whatever they can pass they're
[02:41:04.020 --> 02:41:07.700]  going to do they're going to throw every bit of mud they can against the wall
[02:41:07.700 --> 02:41:10.740]  and know that some of it's going to stick and they never stop
[02:41:10.740 --> 02:41:14.580]  i mean that's the thing about these crooks two
[02:41:14.580 --> 02:41:20.020]  two different uh prime ministers have been thrown out in in uh
[02:41:20.020 --> 02:41:24.340]  excuse me in australia one just in england over this and the next person
[02:41:24.340 --> 02:41:28.020]  that comes in whether it's australia england uh the
[02:41:28.020 --> 02:41:30.820]  prime minister of canada you know three four years ago before he was prime
[02:41:30.820 --> 02:41:34.100]  minister he would criticize carbon taxes now he's for it
[02:41:34.100 --> 02:41:38.180]  i mean look at the new labor leader uh over in england
[02:41:38.180 --> 02:41:42.340]  uh you know he supports it look at the new tori who's the prime minister
[02:41:42.340 --> 02:41:47.060]  he supports carbon tax uh this is what the globalists want this is their whole
[02:41:47.060 --> 02:41:51.140]  program and so i don't know i i mean it it's just whatever they can get
[02:41:51.140 --> 02:41:54.980]  they're going to do that's exactly what they've done with the hst
[02:41:54.980 --> 02:41:58.820]  here as well as harmonized sales tax we've already got a municipal tax
[02:41:58.820 --> 02:42:02.580]  provincial tax uh federal tax now this hst what it's
[02:42:02.580 --> 02:42:06.340]  going to do is give the corporation's power to tax everything this is
[02:42:06.340 --> 02:42:09.940]  restaurants everything you buy everything you eat to survive
[02:42:09.940 --> 02:42:13.860]  and they're going to pass on the savings to us of course
[02:42:13.860 --> 02:42:18.740]  of course my my you know what but this is what we're doing here and again michelle
[02:42:18.740 --> 02:42:22.580]  what does james bond said a goldfinger he says do you expect me to talk
[02:42:22.580 --> 02:42:26.580]  no mr bond i expect you to die this is about shutting us down
[02:42:26.580 --> 02:42:30.660]  bankrupting us and then coming in with the soft kill weapons
[02:42:30.660 --> 02:42:34.420]  i appreciate your call michelle i've got my call this way across the room on a
[02:42:34.420 --> 02:42:37.860]  big computer screen and i guess my eyesight's failing me so i apologize for

[02:45:35.140 --> 02:45:38.740]  the last 15 years and he's been out there for more than two decades
[02:45:38.740 --> 02:45:42.020]  most highly decorated police officer in phoenix arizona history
[02:45:42.020 --> 02:45:48.180]  of course also a military veteran uh and uh he joins us uh today
[02:45:48.180 --> 02:45:51.460]  back in the days of the newsletter he was one of the icons out there you know
[02:45:51.460 --> 02:45:54.020]  before there was the computers warning police and military
[02:45:54.020 --> 02:45:57.540]  with his operation vampire killer 2000 other publications
[02:45:57.540 --> 02:46:01.460]  and he has the sources now he was the first to report on this now i've
[02:46:01.460 --> 02:46:04.740]  separately seen a gentleman with zimmerman oil talking about it
[02:46:04.740 --> 02:46:08.100]  i've seen other news articles out there by a bunch of publications
[02:46:08.100 --> 02:46:12.260]  uh you know saying this is the word but i wanted to go specifically to jack
[02:46:12.260 --> 02:46:16.260]  mclam you know after we see this footage out of phoenix arizona
[02:46:16.260 --> 02:46:21.060]  of senator kyle and i talked with us with lord montan last hour
[02:46:21.060 --> 02:46:24.420]  coming out and saying look i was in a private meeting with obama
[02:46:24.420 --> 02:46:28.020]  president obama and he told me i'm gonna leave the border open as a way to hold
[02:46:28.020 --> 02:46:30.900]  the american people hostage with all the crime and murder down there
[02:46:30.900 --> 02:46:34.740]  so they'll pass amnesty which is just legalization
[02:46:34.740 --> 02:46:41.060]  and that's what they're doing uh so yeah they'll let a crisis go to uh
[02:46:41.060 --> 02:46:43.860]  you know they won't let a good crisis go to waste we know they're blocking all
[02:46:43.860 --> 02:46:49.620]  the oil skimmers blocking the estuary dams blocking the sand berms i mean
[02:46:49.620 --> 02:46:53.460]  out there actually blocking it so we know they're blocking it premeditatedly
[02:46:53.460 --> 02:46:56.980]  and using a crisis so they're now aiding and abetting and
[02:46:56.980 --> 02:47:01.060]  becoming uh part of the event so that's the same thing is staging it
[02:47:01.060 --> 02:47:05.220]  and we know they gave anna darko and halliburton the orders that's in the
[02:47:05.220 --> 02:47:09.220]  coast guard testimony from the people on board to do things that aren't done on
[02:47:09.220 --> 02:47:13.780]  oil rigs that they knew would blow up but more and more the evidence is that
[02:47:13.780 --> 02:47:16.500]  there may that there was an unscheduled change
[02:47:16.500 --> 02:47:19.540]  two hours before something that wasn't authorized
[02:47:19.540 --> 02:47:23.700]  and now we'll get that intel from officer jack mclam from his
[02:47:23.700 --> 02:47:26.420]  sources that obviously will go unnamed because they don't want to get a bullet
[02:47:26.420 --> 02:47:28.660]  in the head that's what he told me during the break
[02:47:28.660 --> 02:47:32.660]  jack good to have you on with us good to be on with you alex thanks for all you
[02:47:32.660 --> 02:47:35.860]  do for god and country well i try and thank you sir
[02:47:35.860 --> 02:47:39.220]  okay as much as you can tell us because you've been saying this since
[02:47:39.220 --> 02:47:43.380]  really early on that you were the first what did your intel sources and
[02:47:43.380 --> 02:47:46.740]  federal law enforcement local police and military tell you about what's really
[02:47:46.740 --> 02:47:51.780]  going on in the gulf well it's uh all stage
[02:47:51.780 --> 02:47:59.060]  it's all stage they had um as you said very strange the bureau of land
[02:47:59.060 --> 02:48:03.460]  management on their two hours before the bomb went off
[02:48:03.460 --> 02:48:06.740]  and um they they were doing a very
[02:48:06.740 --> 02:48:10.740]  uncharacteristic inspection of an oil rig
[02:48:10.740 --> 02:48:14.420]  which the bureau of land management doesn't do
[02:48:14.420 --> 02:48:18.100]  and uh then two hours after they left the bomb went off
[02:48:18.100 --> 02:48:23.860]  blew up the oil rig you know so it was all a false flag operation
[02:48:23.860 --> 02:48:30.900]  to help the uh the oil barons make more money
[02:48:30.900 --> 02:48:35.620]  and stop the finding of oil in these offshore
[02:48:35.620 --> 02:48:39.140]  uh oil rig because they're monopoly men just like bp gets 80 percent of the
[02:48:39.140 --> 02:48:41.940]  alaskan oil right and of course they're the big carbon tax
[02:48:41.940 --> 02:48:44.980]  pushers but was this a military source a police source
[02:48:44.980 --> 02:48:48.340]  was it one source multiple sources i mean give us an idea
[02:48:48.340 --> 02:48:52.820]  it was multiple sources and and let me get my timeline right when did you
[02:48:52.820 --> 02:48:58.340]  first start getting this intel oh about a month ago
[02:48:58.340 --> 02:49:05.060]  yeah about a month ago and um all all the people that uh i talked to and
[02:49:05.060 --> 02:49:10.260]  contacted and they contacted me are scared to death
[02:49:10.260 --> 02:49:18.740]  um of being executed if they if anybody finds out that they talk to me about it
[02:49:18.740 --> 02:49:22.020]  yeah and as you say zack Zimmerman
[02:49:22.020 --> 02:49:26.420]  are the is the one that put out that the bureau of land management did an
[02:49:26.420 --> 02:49:32.660]  uncharacteristic surprise inspection the day the oil rig blew up
[02:49:32.660 --> 02:49:37.860]  and they were on that oil rig the the bureau of land management doesn't do
[02:49:37.860 --> 02:49:42.580]  oil rig inspections but they were on this one in two hours after they left it
[02:49:42.580 --> 02:49:47.380]  blew up so these uh sources that have
[02:49:47.380 --> 02:49:52.020]  contacted me believe that uh it was all a false flag
[02:49:52.020 --> 02:49:58.340]  operation to also fill the the concentration camps
[02:49:58.340 --> 02:50:02.020]  they they're talking about picking up 40 to 50
[02:50:02.020 --> 02:50:05.380]  thousand people and putting them in these
[02:50:05.380 --> 02:50:09.300]  halliburton concentration now i saw that i see
[02:50:09.300 --> 02:50:12.180]  and again then that's all sold like after katrina as if it's a good thing i
[02:50:12.180 --> 02:50:15.780]  remember seeing that a month ago and then they did deploy the military and
[02:50:15.780 --> 02:50:18.820]  now the epa is talking about evacuating some areas
[02:50:18.820 --> 02:50:23.220]  and they're now calling it tilt uh roiders and others are reporting that
[02:50:23.220 --> 02:50:26.420]  people are getting sick two of the workers have died
[02:50:26.420 --> 02:50:30.820]  a captain's committed suicide so we know they've been lying about the toxicity
[02:50:30.820 --> 02:50:35.860]  right uh but but my intel is they are at least exacerbating this
[02:50:35.860 --> 02:50:39.060]  to get their carbon tax pass and now obama
[02:50:39.060 --> 02:50:44.260]  berry sataro uh is out promoting that it's also a smoke screen for the iran
[02:50:44.260 --> 02:50:47.860]  attack they've got geared up but specifically um
[02:50:47.860 --> 02:50:51.220]  you know you have broken many government documents
[02:50:51.220 --> 02:50:55.060]  in the past literally hundreds of times the the phoenix memo
[02:50:55.060 --> 02:50:58.660]  back in 98 saying patriots and gun owners were terrorist
[02:50:58.660 --> 02:51:02.020]  uh you know just a new version of that we got from law enforcement last year
[02:51:02.020 --> 02:51:05.940]  mayak and homeland security reports uh so i mean jack you have broken a lot of
[02:51:05.940 --> 02:51:09.620]  key news and we respect your your your sources but i mean any
[02:51:09.620 --> 02:51:13.540]  other details that they can uh that your sources gave you i mean were
[02:51:13.540 --> 02:51:16.660]  these eyewitnesses or were they told by other law enforcement
[02:51:16.660 --> 02:51:19.860]  or i mean i mean give us as much specifics as you can well
[02:51:19.860 --> 02:51:24.660]  they just said that they were in meetings where this was talked about
[02:51:24.660 --> 02:51:32.660]  blowing up this oil rig and um of course the oil barons are part of the
[02:51:32.660 --> 02:51:38.900]  communist zionist uh controllers of our nation today and they were in
[02:51:38.900 --> 02:51:41.380]  meetings talking about they were going to boil
[02:51:41.380 --> 02:51:47.700]  blow this thing up so we had wachovia who is owned by well
[02:51:47.700 --> 02:51:51.140]  fargo bank sell two and a half million shares
[02:51:51.140 --> 02:51:58.340]  two weeks before it blew up swiss bank ubs sold two million shares 97 percent
[02:51:58.340 --> 02:52:05.460]  of their stock and wachovia sold 98 percent of their bp stock
[02:52:05.460 --> 02:52:10.020]  and golden sacks sold 44 percent of their bp stock
[02:52:10.020 --> 02:52:17.460]  and uh tony hayward the ceo of bp that's been on the news a lot today
[02:52:17.460 --> 02:52:23.300]  sold all of his stock 1.4 million worth of bp stock just a couple weeks before
[02:52:23.300 --> 02:52:29.060]  the bomb went off so it's the same as 9 11 brother i thought it was 33 percent
[02:52:29.060 --> 02:52:32.820]  but then i already had sold even more later and in goldman sacks sold 44
[02:52:32.820 --> 02:52:38.100]  percent of their stocks right uh but uh
[02:52:38.100 --> 02:52:43.540]  now when you talk about israel uh involvement uh i i hadn't really i mean
[02:52:43.540 --> 02:52:47.700]  federal government blm i mean this whole combine of interest
[02:52:47.700 --> 02:52:50.500]  uh wanting to push for but i do see it as a distraction
[02:52:50.500 --> 02:52:54.820]  as israel and u.s forces do openly say they made nuke iran
[02:52:54.820 --> 02:52:57.300]  and boy that's just going to be terrible and then the iranians say they're
[02:52:57.300 --> 02:53:00.980]  going to try to break the gaza blockade which is insane
[02:53:00.980 --> 02:53:05.220]  and uh i mean i mean we don't want war here we want all these sides to
[02:53:05.220 --> 02:53:09.380]  to stop what they're doing so so you specifically talked
[02:53:09.380 --> 02:53:14.660]  to sources uh law enforcement military who were in meetings
[02:53:14.660 --> 02:53:18.500]  when they were talking about government blew it up or may have blown it up
[02:53:18.500 --> 02:53:22.980]  yeah or or they were in meetings talking about how they were going to blow it up
[02:53:22.980 --> 02:53:27.300]  uh how they were going to this was before it happened
[02:53:27.300 --> 02:53:33.620]  and uh so halliburton was on that oil rig just hours before it blew up and the
[02:53:33.620 --> 02:53:38.340]  bureau of land management was there too so one of those
[02:53:38.340 --> 02:53:42.500]  organizations planted the bomb on the oil rig
[02:53:42.500 --> 02:53:46.180]  according to my sources
[02:53:48.580 --> 02:53:52.740]  wow i wish those sources could um i would think they'd be in more danger
[02:53:52.740 --> 02:53:57.700]  not speaking out i mean i i mean i can't imagine government or corporate espionage
[02:53:57.700 --> 02:54:00.900]  groups having more than three or four people in a meeting where this would be
[02:54:00.900 --> 02:54:04.180]  discussed that's something you'd keep compartmentalized so
[02:54:04.180 --> 02:54:09.700]  oh yes it's definitely compartmentalized but i have contacts i had a
[02:54:09.700 --> 02:54:14.980]  top secret clearance during the vietnam war and was back on the secret
[02:54:14.980 --> 02:54:20.740]  intel basis and made a lot of contact with intel people weren't you in
[02:54:20.740 --> 02:54:24.420]  cambodia no i never went to camp oh no that was that
[02:54:24.420 --> 02:54:27.780]  that was a butch paul was in black ops in cambodia that's right
[02:54:27.780 --> 02:54:32.020]  yeah no i i wanted to uh i was
[02:54:32.020 --> 02:54:39.460]  17 18 years of age when i was uh i've enlisted when i was 17
[02:54:39.460 --> 02:54:47.940]  and i was the first american 16 year old that was taken by the navy divers and
[02:54:47.940 --> 02:54:51.540]  taught to use scuba gear and certified in scuba gear in
[02:54:51.540 --> 02:54:56.500]  washington district of criminals and uh so i went to my
[02:54:56.500 --> 02:55:01.780]  uh recruiter and i told him that i was certified in
[02:55:01.780 --> 02:55:06.020]  scuba gear by the navy divers that wanted to be part of the udt the
[02:55:06.020 --> 02:55:10.100]  underwater demolition team they they're called the field today that's jesse
[02:55:10.100 --> 02:55:14.180]  ventura yeah yeah and uh they said the recruiter says
[02:55:14.180 --> 02:55:18.740]  sure signed here so i was stupid enough to sign up
[02:55:18.740 --> 02:55:22.660]  and then they put me back in these intel bases in the jungles
[02:55:22.660 --> 02:55:27.940]  with a top secret clearance and and it helped because i met a lot of people
[02:55:27.940 --> 02:55:31.220]  that were no jack we know that i mean you had the premier organization police
[02:55:31.220 --> 02:55:33.380]  and military against the new world order and all these sources
[02:55:33.380 --> 02:55:37.140]  yeah i just this is pretty big i mean i i mean i believe you have these sources
[02:55:37.140 --> 02:55:41.380]  and you i mean it's just it's amazing uh to be here talking to you and you're
[02:55:41.380 --> 02:55:48.420]  saying you've got multiple sources uh who who i mean one source to be specific
[02:55:48.420 --> 02:55:52.340]  who said they were in on a meeting when the government was discussing uh
[02:55:52.340 --> 02:55:58.180]  sabotaging it with an explosive or two people or do you have people two people
[02:55:58.180 --> 02:56:01.460]  or or okay and you have uh and you said other sources
[02:56:01.460 --> 02:56:06.180]  i mean do you have any other intel from what people generally in law enforcement
[02:56:06.180 --> 02:56:11.940]  think well um i was called the other day
[02:56:11.940 --> 02:56:15.540]  and uh was told i was going to get an email
[02:56:15.540 --> 02:56:21.620]  and i got an email that chaney and bush and halliburton purchased
[02:56:21.620 --> 02:56:25.460]  purchased a oil cleaning firm two weeks before the
[02:56:25.460 --> 02:56:30.260]  blow up of the oil platform boots and coats you know that that's confirmed
[02:56:30.260 --> 02:56:35.060]  right and uh so i i'm getting some good information
[02:56:35.060 --> 02:56:41.540]  it's just uh and then now we have a scared bp insider
[02:56:41.540 --> 02:56:46.260]  predicted that uh it was blown up on purpose
[02:56:46.260 --> 02:56:50.180]  you know we have denis whitney now he didn't give us
[02:56:50.180 --> 02:56:54.100]  his name but we went and traced his ip address
[02:56:54.100 --> 02:56:57.940]  back to denis whitney so he may end up dead
[02:56:57.940 --> 02:57:02.260]  but he's well that's not too good to talk yeah he's really scared
[02:57:02.260 --> 02:57:07.220]  okay well we'll try to be the insider and he said that uh
[02:57:07.220 --> 02:57:11.700]  that it was blown up on purpose a false flag operation
[02:57:11.700 --> 02:57:15.220]  okay well they can also ip spoof so we'll have to look into that wow
[02:57:15.220 --> 02:57:18.980]  uh jack mclam is our guest this is just getting
[02:57:18.980 --> 02:57:23.780]  crazier by the moment um well there's no doubt we're going into
[02:57:23.780 --> 02:57:26.500]  tyranny they're openly talking about shutting the web off
[02:57:26.500 --> 02:57:29.620]  or openly talking about arresting dissidents they've got
[02:57:29.620 --> 02:57:32.660]  southern property law center reports the southern property law center called
[02:57:32.660 --> 02:57:36.100]  him by my first name they said oh alex isn't calling for violence
[02:57:36.100 --> 02:57:39.060]  but what he's saying will cause his followers to
[02:57:39.060 --> 02:57:43.460]  i mean they must really be concerned about us uh if they're trying to demonize
[02:57:43.460 --> 02:57:45.940]  us i mean jack we've never called for violence have we
[02:57:45.940 --> 02:57:50.180]  no i haven't called for violence and you haven't either alex
[02:57:50.180 --> 02:57:55.460]  and uh so um but the southern poverty pimp law center
[02:57:55.460 --> 02:57:59.620]  is a communist Zionist led organization
[02:57:59.620 --> 02:58:05.380]  and they hate america just like the adl hates america and they want to see it
[02:58:05.380 --> 02:58:10.980]  destroyed so they're doing everything they can to destroy you me and
[02:58:10.980 --> 02:58:18.180]  everybody they can to that's trying to help save america
[02:58:18.180 --> 02:58:22.340]  yeah jack my whole issue on that front is um
[02:58:22.340 --> 02:58:25.620]  i know what the southern property law center and adl are bad guys
[02:58:25.620 --> 02:58:28.580]  i don't think that i mean to use the term zionist i don't think everybody that
[02:58:28.580 --> 02:58:30.980]  believes israel has a right to exist though
[02:58:30.980 --> 02:58:34.100]  is part of the overall new world order operation i mean there are
[02:58:34.100 --> 02:58:38.900]  different variants and different groups out there that's true alex very true
[02:58:38.900 --> 02:58:42.580]  yeah i mean i i mean that's another issue though is that
[02:58:42.580 --> 02:58:47.860]  uh but i know betray us is bad news general betray us and known as betray us
[02:58:47.860 --> 02:58:51.620]  but this other guy micristal it was fingered as the one that covered up the
[02:58:51.620 --> 02:58:53.780]  pat tillman murder we know that was a murder
[02:58:53.780 --> 02:58:56.660]  that's right i mean it's come out that it was a cover up the line the army
[02:58:56.660 --> 02:59:01.060]  coroners have said it was a murder yeah so we have that going on shot shot of
[02:59:01.060 --> 02:59:03.780]  the distance they came up and shot him three times in the head to make sure he
[02:59:03.780 --> 02:59:08.660]  was dead uh but then you expand on that
[02:59:08.660 --> 02:59:13.220]  micristal is bilderberg attendee he is a cfr fellow
[02:59:13.220 --> 02:59:17.220]  and so things must not be going well if a top globalist like micristal
[02:59:17.220 --> 02:59:21.300]  is removed by uh... obama do you think that was just thin skin
[02:59:21.300 --> 02:59:24.100]  or uh... what's the info you got on that front
[02:59:24.100 --> 02:59:27.220]  well i think that uh... from what i'm hearing
[02:59:27.220 --> 02:59:31.540]  that micristal couldn't be trusted you know he was
[02:59:31.540 --> 02:59:35.860]  he was fighting with america and uh...
[02:59:35.860 --> 02:59:41.380]  against the globalist and so even though he was a cfr
[02:59:41.380 --> 02:59:46.260]  and other other connections uh... they say he couldn't be trusted
[02:59:46.260 --> 02:59:50.900]  and uh... betray us uh... general betray us
[02:59:50.900 --> 02:59:57.620]  can be trusted one hundred percent they say yeah i wonder if
[02:59:57.620 --> 03:00:00.420]  he didn't say the right thing at bilderberg you know he was just there
[03:00:00.420 --> 03:00:04.340]  three weeks ago it's on record right uh... that general micristal
[03:00:04.340 --> 03:00:09.380]  uh stanley micristal was there yeah and then meanwhile they said he fainted i
[03:00:09.380 --> 03:00:14.420]  i've seen people have seizures uh betray us clearly had a seizure
[03:00:14.420 --> 03:00:20.020]  that's true that's true well they're they're scared of micristal
[03:00:20.020 --> 03:00:24.020]  and so they've gotten rid of him and he may end up dead
[03:00:24.020 --> 03:00:27.620]  according to my sources well yeah he was in the delta force they don't actually
[03:00:27.620 --> 03:00:30.660]  like real warriors they like uh people that are having seizures
[03:00:30.660 --> 03:00:34.020]  that's right yeah they like fainters not fighters stay there
[03:00:34.020 --> 03:00:37.940]  uh let's come back and and of course your websites uh we'll plug that too stay
[03:00:37.940 --> 03:00:43.540]  with us
[03:00:43.540 --> 03:00:47.780]  jack mick lamb dot or g i asked jack as he's a big teddy bear he's a really
[03:00:47.780 --> 03:00:50.660]  nice guy i asked him i said why don't you give this
[03:00:50.660 --> 03:00:54.260]  bp insider that sent you an email's name out
[03:00:54.260 --> 03:00:58.820]  and uh he said well because the his name was on the ip address and the
[03:00:58.820 --> 03:01:01.220]  government reads all the email that comes into my office
[03:01:01.220 --> 03:01:04.420]  which of course they do they will know what law enforcement military thing and
[03:01:04.420 --> 03:01:07.540]  that's why if you're gonna send an email folks you need to send it from a dummy
[03:01:07.540 --> 03:01:11.540]  account uh or something else uh and so that's a good
[03:01:11.540 --> 03:01:14.180]  point jack made that he's trying to protect that person
[03:01:14.180 --> 03:01:17.140]  but who knows that could have been a spoof name as well there's all sorts of
[03:01:17.140 --> 03:01:20.420]  tricks uh on the web when we've gotten law
[03:01:20.420 --> 03:01:25.940]  enforcement military uh intel type stuff we first call make phone calls
[03:01:25.940 --> 03:01:31.620]  confirm it's accurate and then we erase all the material
[03:01:31.620 --> 03:01:35.540]  you know the communications we received believe me you get an fbi document
[03:01:35.540 --> 03:01:39.300]  you call the fbi agents names up with a control number they start freaking
[03:01:39.300 --> 03:01:42.980]  out and then you know it's real plus you know how to read this stuff after a
[03:01:42.980 --> 03:01:47.140]  while and tell if it's real uh but we'll continue to investigate uh this
[03:01:47.140 --> 03:01:50.740]  overall but officer jack mclam is our guest
[03:01:50.740 --> 03:01:54.900]  don't forget my websites are info wars dot com and prison planet dot tv
[03:01:54.900 --> 03:01:57.700]  and don't think it's because you're awake to what's happening your friends and
[03:01:57.700 --> 03:02:02.660]  family are they're ready to be awakened now is the time and it's life and death
[03:02:02.660 --> 03:02:08.900]  that we expose this system uh jack i mean america finally
[03:02:08.900 --> 03:02:13.140]  realizes we're going into tyranny and you've got all these corrupt special
[03:02:13.140 --> 03:02:16.100]  interests that are just in a free for all looting this country and other
[03:02:16.100 --> 03:02:20.420]  nations uh i just uh hope people pray for this
[03:02:20.420 --> 03:02:25.220]  nation i hope they do too i ask them every day on my show
[03:02:25.220 --> 03:02:31.460]  to pray for the nation yeah let me say something alec i'm uh
[03:02:31.460 --> 03:02:37.380]  really happy that you said what you did about there's a lot of good jews out
[03:02:37.380 --> 03:02:42.740]  there and i have five
[03:02:42.740 --> 03:02:48.260]  uh website written by millions and millions of jews
[03:02:48.260 --> 03:02:53.700]  against the communist zionist we have jews versus zionist
[03:02:53.700 --> 03:02:59.220]  dot wordpress dot com we've got jews against zionist dot com
[03:02:59.220 --> 03:03:05.300]  jews not zionist dot org and so millions and millions of jews have gotten
[03:03:05.300 --> 03:03:09.620]  together to stand up and talk against the communist zionist
[03:03:09.620 --> 03:03:16.260]  who are have been in control of israel since 1948 and are still in control of
[03:03:16.260 --> 03:03:21.380]  them today and are causing all the wars and causing all the violence over
[03:03:21.380 --> 03:03:26.180]  there they created hamas 20 years ago to bomb them
[03:03:26.180 --> 03:03:30.740]  regularly every few weeks and they created the hamas
[03:03:30.740 --> 03:03:35.300]  organization to bomb them so that they could destroy the balance jack here's
[03:03:35.300 --> 03:03:38.820]  my issue though uh is that i've run into
[03:03:38.820 --> 03:03:42.260]  different groups that say catholics are all evil and run everything or jews are
[03:03:42.260 --> 03:03:44.820]  all evil and run everything i'm just trying to fight the new
[03:03:44.820 --> 03:03:47.540]  world order and trying to get everybody together
[03:03:47.540 --> 03:03:50.740]  against the new world order one of those sites you mentioned makes up out
[03:03:50.740 --> 03:03:55.860]  landish things that are a hundred false uh about me and so
[03:03:55.860 --> 03:03:58.980]  you know that's my issue is criticizing israel and some of the
[03:03:58.980 --> 03:04:01.620]  different veins of zionism because for me in the research
[03:04:01.620 --> 03:04:05.460]  there's a lot of different flavors of it uh you know that's one thing
[03:04:05.460 --> 03:04:09.060]  and we have guests on to do that uh you know my only other issue is
[03:04:09.060 --> 03:04:12.820]  is that i've seen from the camp that thinks literally israel
[03:04:12.820 --> 03:04:16.980]  is blz bob uh i've seen a lot of dishonesty
[03:04:16.980 --> 03:04:20.580]  from you know those crowds and just just you know just amazing
[03:04:20.580 --> 03:04:24.820]  stuff but there's no doubt israel is pushing to start a war with iran
[03:04:24.820 --> 03:04:29.140]  and i am firmly against that and i'm firmly against all this aid to all
[03:04:29.140 --> 03:04:32.580]  these foreign countries i believe in what george washington said i ran out of

[03:08:32.020 --> 03:08:36.180]  you've got an 80 plus page uh breakdown that you sent him two weeks ago
[03:08:36.180 --> 03:08:39.380]  he won't respond and so i guess you're starting an opening
[03:08:39.380 --> 03:08:42.180]  salvo here you said the next few days one more chance
[03:08:42.180 --> 03:08:47.620]  you're going to publish it we're going to put it up on infowars.com and and i
[03:08:47.620 --> 03:08:51.780]  understand you're flabbergasted by uh just the complete
[03:08:51.780 --> 03:08:55.380]  fabrication but sometimes they say hitler said the bigger the lie the more
[03:08:55.380 --> 03:08:58.660]  they'll believe it but also the bigger the lie the faster it'll fall
[03:08:58.660 --> 03:09:02.340]  so just run over some of the other deceptions let's just take one example
[03:09:02.340 --> 03:09:06.020]  he said that i had misrepresented the work of
[03:09:06.020 --> 03:09:09.860]  dr david david barba who's a climate researcher now
[03:09:09.860 --> 03:09:13.220]  there's just one problem with that i had not cited
[03:09:13.220 --> 03:09:18.500]  that researchers work at any point in my talk nor indeed have i ever done so
[03:09:18.500 --> 03:09:23.060]  he just made it up then he did he said that i had
[03:09:23.060 --> 03:09:28.420]  conducted and then misrepresented the results of a google scholar search for
[03:09:28.420 --> 03:09:32.740]  scientific papers containing all the words global climate and change
[03:09:32.740 --> 03:09:38.100]  between 2004 and 2007 abraham also alleged that the quantity of scientific
[03:09:38.100 --> 03:09:41.620]  papers retrieved in the search i said it was 539
[03:09:41.620 --> 03:09:46.020]  had been a complete fabrication he's accusing me of a lie
[03:09:46.020 --> 03:09:49.300]  uh because he says there was there were far more than that now
[03:09:49.300 --> 03:09:53.060]  abraham knew when he get when he said his lie
[03:09:53.060 --> 03:09:57.060]  because i had said so in the talk he was commenting on and made clear in the
[03:09:57.060 --> 03:10:01.140]  relevant slide that the search hadn't been done by me
[03:10:01.140 --> 03:10:05.860]  it had been done by uh class martin schilder a very distinguished researcher
[03:10:05.860 --> 03:10:10.100]  mr schilder's search results had been reported in 2006
[03:10:10.100 --> 03:10:13.860]  in a peer reviewed journal from which i had quite legitimately and accurately
[03:10:13.860 --> 03:10:18.500]  cited a key result the database searched was not google scholar
[03:10:18.500 --> 03:10:22.500]  but the isi web of science database the search was not for
[03:10:22.500 --> 03:10:26.740]  all of the words global climate and change but for the exact phrase
[03:10:26.740 --> 03:10:30.020]  global climate change because that phrase is a standard one used in
[03:10:30.020 --> 03:10:33.060]  searches of the kind the search period hadn't been
[03:10:33.060 --> 03:10:37.700]  2004 to 2007 but 2004 to mid february 2007
[03:10:37.700 --> 03:10:40.580]  which makes a difference the number of papers so basically he just made up
[03:10:40.580 --> 03:10:44.900]  whatever he wanted and but contrary to the allegation of complete fabrication
[03:10:44.900 --> 03:10:50.420]  mr schilder's search had indeed retrieved 539 scientific papers and not the
[03:10:50.420 --> 03:10:54.660]  several thousand that abraham's google scholar search had turned
[03:10:54.660 --> 03:10:58.820]  up on a completely different subject so he had got wrong
[03:10:58.820 --> 03:11:02.340]  the database we searched the search term we used
[03:11:02.340 --> 03:11:06.100]  the period over which the search was conducted everything
[03:11:06.100 --> 03:11:09.860]  uh that had been plainly and accurately stated
[03:11:09.860 --> 03:11:15.540]  in my talk he he just lies about it and then says that i am guilty of a
[03:11:15.540 --> 03:11:20.500]  complete fabrication well sir you know the british is even more
[03:11:20.500 --> 03:11:25.620]  intense stronger but under u.s law the definition of defamation libel or
[03:11:25.620 --> 03:11:31.300]  slander is premeditatedly manufacturing lies about someone
[03:11:31.300 --> 03:11:36.820]  to damage them and this this just from the preliminary here he goes on and on
[03:11:36.820 --> 03:11:41.300]  sounds like it fits the very definition of that i mean i think we are going to
[03:11:41.300 --> 03:11:46.100]  be looking at a legal case if we we can't get us a any sense
[03:11:46.100 --> 03:11:49.300]  out of the president of the university who again if you're listening to this i
[03:11:49.300 --> 03:11:51.780]  want you to email this creeper for president
[03:11:51.780 --> 03:11:57.060]  father dennis j d that's dj d e a s for sugar e
[03:11:57.060 --> 03:12:02.740]  at st thomas dot edu dj d e a s for sugar e at
[03:12:02.740 --> 03:12:08.500]  st thomas dot edu and tell him to do his job this is an assault on you i mean
[03:12:08.500 --> 03:12:13.700]  this is an assault on you to to to create this scurrilous list of fiction
[03:12:13.700 --> 03:12:16.340]  and then say it's real i mean run through some more of it
[03:12:16.340 --> 03:12:20.260]  yes here's another one he said that i'd misrepresented the findings in a paper
[03:12:20.260 --> 03:12:25.620]  by dr leudt keegwin now in fact i had merely reproduced a graph by dr
[03:12:25.620 --> 03:12:29.540]  keegwin showing that there was evidence that in that
[03:12:29.540 --> 03:12:34.420]  graph the medieval war period had been warmer than the president
[03:12:34.420 --> 03:12:40.900]  and um but everyone admits that everyone admits that going back to the
[03:12:40.900 --> 03:12:44.500]  maxim back in the start of the bronze age what eight thousand years ago
[03:12:44.500 --> 03:12:48.180]  that was going on i mean look the even the mainstream media admits you've been
[03:12:48.180 --> 03:12:52.100]  right about the cooling for nine years i mean you've overturned their entire
[03:12:52.100 --> 03:12:54.260]  fraud here's another wonderful one
[03:12:54.260 --> 03:12:57.700]  he abraham falsely represented me as having
[03:12:57.700 --> 03:13:01.780]  misrepresented the results of a paper by noon et al
[03:13:01.780 --> 03:13:06.420]  although abraham knew when he told this lie in his talk
[03:13:06.420 --> 03:13:10.900]  that i had correctly reproduced a graph from that paper
[03:13:10.900 --> 03:13:15.700]  which was about antarctica and abraham then also knew that a comment on the
[03:13:15.700 --> 03:13:19.780]  internet from one of the authors of the paper to the effect that the arctic is
[03:13:19.780 --> 03:13:23.540]  today warming rapidly had no bearing whatsoever on my use of a
[03:13:23.540 --> 03:13:26.340]  graph from that paper which was demonstrating the reality of the
[03:13:26.340 --> 03:13:31.060]  medieval war period in antarctica this guy abraham knows so little
[03:13:31.060 --> 03:13:33.620]  climate science he can't even tell the difference
[03:13:33.620 --> 03:13:38.340]  between the medieval war period in the present or the antarctic and the arctic
[03:13:38.340 --> 03:13:42.580]  that's how louis so he was he was floating around at thousand year
[03:13:42.580 --> 03:13:45.780]  multi thousand year five hundred year intervals
[03:13:45.780 --> 03:13:50.180]  not even knowing where he was and not even knowing the difference exactly
[03:13:50.180 --> 03:13:53.540]  not even knowing the difference when he didn't even know what the medieval warm
[03:13:53.540 --> 03:13:56.980]  period when they had grapes in england he doesn't appear to have understood that
[03:13:56.980 --> 03:14:01.620]  at all because i was citing a paper that was looking at that period he then
[03:14:01.620 --> 03:14:05.060]  gets hold of one of the authors and finds on their website a statement about the
[03:14:05.060 --> 03:14:08.020]  arctic today well that has nothing to do with the
[03:14:08.020 --> 03:14:12.500]  antarctic in the medieval war period a thousand years ago the an arctic is is the
[03:14:12.500 --> 03:14:16.020]  southern and the arctic's the north he didn't even know that he didn't even
[03:14:16.020 --> 03:14:20.420]  know that um and he stands excuse me my my six
[03:14:20.420 --> 03:14:24.100]  year old knows that lord mongden that's right i wrote to him and i gave him a
[03:14:24.100 --> 03:14:27.700]  copy of of at least the president of the university gave him a copy of my
[03:14:27.700 --> 03:14:31.300]  letter to the president of the university pointing that one out and he stands
[03:14:31.300 --> 03:14:34.820]  by his position the arctic and the arctic are the same
[03:14:34.820 --> 03:14:38.980]  i mean that's what he says when he says i stand by my position he's standing by
[03:14:38.980 --> 03:14:42.900]  all these lies i'm sorry but that one blew me away
[03:14:42.900 --> 03:14:46.180]  he doesn't know i mean i could go on and on and on and on there are so i mean
[03:14:46.180 --> 03:14:49.860]  there are literally hundreds of these and what i've done is i've done a very
[03:14:49.860 --> 03:14:53.700]  long letter it's 84 pages long to abraham himself
[03:14:53.700 --> 03:14:57.060]  which he hasn't replied to except to say he stands by his position
[03:14:57.060 --> 03:15:00.580]  he stands by all these lies even though it's plain and absurd that they're
[03:15:00.580 --> 03:15:05.060]  lied it's quite clear that they're lies um and of course
[03:15:05.060 --> 03:15:08.900]  this discredits him utterly in the eyes of his colleagues
[03:15:08.900 --> 03:15:13.060]  in the eyes of academia generally and he's about to be made a big fool of
[03:15:13.060 --> 03:15:15.940]  and turn about fair play i mean you are a
[03:15:15.940 --> 03:15:20.180]  formidable intellect if you've done your research i mean you're one of the few
[03:15:20.180 --> 03:15:23.780]  people who's going to be addressing the world federation of scientists
[03:15:23.780 --> 03:15:27.860]  who is a layman uh and i think this guy has no idea
[03:15:27.860 --> 03:15:32.100]  that he's got a tiger by the tail i i think he has every every idea of that
[03:15:32.100 --> 03:15:36.020]  now which is why he's he's i think on legal advice
[03:15:36.020 --> 03:15:39.700]  he's decided not to pick himself any further in you see if he admits he got it
[03:15:39.700 --> 03:15:43.300]  wrong i'd be willing to say fine admit you've got it wrong
[03:15:43.300 --> 03:15:47.060]  put up a you know take this that this is being broadcast on the university's
[03:15:47.060 --> 03:15:51.460]  web server and every slide has the imprint of no i know i saw it i saw it a
[03:15:51.460 --> 03:15:54.660]  few weeks ago and i've ignored it just because i mean i've seen the
[03:15:54.660 --> 03:15:58.580]  these people lie continually and yeah i mean i mean he ought to get hired by
[03:15:58.580 --> 03:16:02.820]  reason why this one's interesting is that this is clearly a lot of money has
[03:16:02.820 --> 03:16:05.780]  been spent on this and it wasn't his money
[03:16:05.780 --> 03:16:09.860]  somebody has backed this and somebody has organized it and it's been very
[03:16:09.860 --> 03:16:12.980]  artfully done so if you first look at you think oh my god what a complete
[03:16:12.980 --> 03:16:15.860]  lunatic monkey he doesn't know the first thing about anything
[03:16:15.860 --> 03:16:20.180]  it's only when you've seen my letter to abraham which just goes through it point
[03:16:20.180 --> 03:16:25.460]  by point by inexorable point that you see just what a liar this man is
[03:16:25.460 --> 03:16:30.340]  and just how very foolish the president of the university for the djd
[03:16:30.340 --> 03:16:34.340]  is not to investigate the matter and if you're listening to this
[03:16:34.340 --> 03:16:39.300]  and you want to help out here and get the truth to be to register once again
[03:16:39.300 --> 03:16:44.740]  in academia then email djdeas for sugar e at
[03:16:44.740 --> 03:16:50.980]  st thomas dot edu sdthomas.edu well also lord
[03:16:50.980 --> 03:16:54.020]  montan get a story out about this in the next few days and we'll put the phone
[03:16:54.020 --> 03:16:59.300]  numbers up there because because i know the standard of libel slander
[03:16:59.300 --> 03:17:02.740]  defamation because i'm a radio host yeah and when i first got into radio i had
[03:17:02.740 --> 03:17:05.300]  to you know sit there with lawyers and we taught all this
[03:17:05.300 --> 03:17:09.940]  in in in quite a few little classes yeah but the fact if their lawyers telling
[03:17:09.940 --> 03:17:13.540]  them to not retract their lawyers not telling them the
[03:17:13.540 --> 03:17:16.980]  right thing if they premeditatedly lied about you
[03:17:16.980 --> 03:17:21.300]  the only hope they've got is to reverse and apologize
[03:17:21.300 --> 03:17:25.620]  if they keep it out there uh they are going to be sunk
[03:17:25.620 --> 03:17:30.020]  well they are indeed and i'm just waiting to i'm giving them every chance
[03:17:30.020 --> 03:17:34.260]  because the courts don't like this to be a sort of political football
[03:17:34.260 --> 03:17:38.260]  so what i like to do is and because i i have had to sue for libel on two or
[03:17:38.260 --> 03:17:41.140]  three occasions before i've always succeeded i've never lost
[03:17:41.140 --> 03:17:44.740]  you said him a tort letter basically you're you know i haven't i haven't yet
[03:17:44.740 --> 03:17:47.780]  but i mean that's what your letter is saying i have these questions i'm
[03:17:47.780 --> 03:17:51.380]  grateful if you'd answer and in the meantime please take it off the web
[03:17:51.380 --> 03:17:55.540]  they haven't done that because what i'm doing is i'm creating a paper trail
[03:17:55.540 --> 03:17:58.820]  where a judge will look you'll say look i've behaved on the whole pretty
[03:17:58.820 --> 03:18:02.740]  reasonably uh the other side hasn't and if the other
[03:18:02.740 --> 03:18:07.460]  side in those circumstances had lied had been had had the lies
[03:18:07.460 --> 03:18:11.780]  fairly drawn to its attention had had a month to get these lies put straight
[03:18:11.780 --> 03:18:16.340]  and had simply refused to tackle it at all then that's the point at which the
[03:18:16.340 --> 03:18:20.980]  judge will award enormous damages now as you know under the freedom of
[03:18:20.980 --> 03:18:24.340]  speech convention uh the the constitutional amendment
[03:18:24.340 --> 03:18:28.580]  um you can say what you like about somebody but if you stray
[03:18:28.580 --> 03:18:32.500]  into fact and you state facts that are not true
[03:18:32.500 --> 03:18:36.260]  and then draw from those facts conclusion about somebody's character
[03:18:36.260 --> 03:18:40.900]  which are strongly adverse to that person that even in american law is liable
[03:18:40.900 --> 03:18:45.460]  look you can't say a public figure is a murderer if they're not
[03:18:45.460 --> 03:18:49.380]  that's right and uh this is this is much more serious than that
[03:18:49.380 --> 03:18:52.820]  because it's going to my professional reputation it's saying i've gone around
[03:18:52.820 --> 03:18:55.620]  the world making these speeches and essentially the whole thing's made up
[03:18:55.620 --> 03:18:57.940]  it's all nonsense i don't know what i'm talking about or where i do know what i
[03:18:57.940 --> 03:19:02.020]  talk about i'm lying if you can't get nastier than that
[03:19:02.020 --> 03:19:07.060]  and for him simply to refuse to answer my letter because he basically can't i mean
[03:19:07.060 --> 03:19:09.700]  it's an unanswerable letter as you'll see when you see it
[03:19:09.700 --> 03:19:14.180]  it's very detailed but it's very interesting it's actually worth
[03:19:14.180 --> 03:19:17.540]  dipping into it it's not a thing to be read in one go it's too long for that
[03:19:17.540 --> 03:19:21.540]  but it's worth just dipping into it and seeing the staggering
[03:19:21.540 --> 03:19:25.860]  dishonesty and i've got all the pictures of my slides and his slides and
[03:19:25.860 --> 03:19:31.060]  reply and his statements about me and then my questions to him about why he
[03:19:31.060 --> 03:19:33.780]  says the things he says and in those questions
[03:19:33.780 --> 03:19:37.060]  i convey the information that makes it very plain to the reader
[03:19:37.060 --> 03:19:41.060]  exactly how it is and how frequently he has simply lied
[03:19:41.060 --> 03:19:44.580]  all right lord montan amazing we'll have to watch the aftermath of this

[03:24:37.380 --> 03:24:40.820]  uh i had a caller call me what two three days ago saying jack mclean's on his
[03:24:40.820 --> 03:24:44.660]  show on jenesis saying he has sources he has a lot in the police and military
[03:24:44.660 --> 03:24:46.580]  because police and military against the new world order
[03:24:46.580 --> 03:24:51.460]  these have for more than 25 years now saying that the
[03:24:51.460 --> 03:24:55.220]  bureau land management went on board and did an inspection and
[03:24:55.220 --> 03:24:58.100]  planted a bomb on it and blew it up i know that
[03:24:58.100 --> 03:25:02.020]  blm was there i know a strange unauthorized
[03:25:02.020 --> 03:25:06.100]  alteration was made that wasn't permitted and wasn't kosher
[03:25:06.100 --> 03:25:10.100]  now the word they used wasn't regulation and wasn't a standard part
[03:25:10.100 --> 03:25:13.620]  and then it happened and then i did a search on it and found some
[03:25:13.620 --> 03:25:17.940]  a guy with an oil company saying it i think zimmerman oil and and and some
[03:25:17.940 --> 03:25:22.660]  other sites saying it so we'll talk to him because i respect jack mclean
[03:25:22.660 --> 03:25:27.460]  uh and get his intel on that front right now let's go to michael taylor michael
[03:25:27.460 --> 03:25:30.420]  kate mason and others michael you're on the air
[03:25:30.420 --> 03:25:36.660]  from canada welcome michelle michelle i can't read i can go
[03:25:36.660 --> 03:25:40.180]  ahead that's okay one of i know my name um just
[03:25:40.180 --> 03:25:42.820]  want to let you know i've been a subscriber to your site and listener for
[03:25:42.820 --> 03:25:45.300]  about three years my brother woke me up by uh
[03:25:45.300 --> 03:25:48.580]  saying the word bill de berg and one search led to another but anyway i'm
[03:25:48.580 --> 03:25:53.540]  looking forward to your chemtrail film too um i was hoping to speak to uh
[03:25:53.540 --> 03:26:00.580]  uh mr uh mongton but anyway it is about um the carbon
[03:26:00.580 --> 03:26:04.100]  uh credit and all that stuff in british columbia
[03:26:04.100 --> 03:26:08.100]  our trader provincial premier gordon cambell
[03:26:08.100 --> 03:26:12.020]  uh who was a an attendee at bill de berg this year with peter mansbridge arbor
[03:26:12.020 --> 03:26:16.180]  and so is so is general mccrystal by the way
[03:26:16.180 --> 03:26:20.340]  nice yes actually i read that this morning um anyways
[03:26:20.340 --> 03:26:26.340]  he imposed a provincial carbon tax on us uh about a year and a half ago or so
[03:26:26.340 --> 03:26:30.820]  now what i'm curious about is i i know that he may be up for um
[03:26:30.820 --> 03:26:35.380]  federal leadership uh going to bill de berg as did steven harper
[03:26:35.380 --> 03:26:38.900]  but what i'm interested in your take on this is
[03:26:38.900 --> 03:26:43.220]  what do you think his uh ultimate plan is other than that
[03:26:43.220 --> 03:26:47.460]  are they going to increase do you think the um carbon tax because this whole
[03:26:47.460 --> 03:26:50.740]  carbon thing and the recycling and the whole green movement is really
[03:26:50.740 --> 03:26:54.580]  sickening out here with all the tree hunters and everything we have right
[03:26:54.580 --> 03:26:59.940]  or do you think they're looking at a federal carbon tax prior to the global
[03:26:59.940 --> 03:27:03.700]  carbon tax and what let me tell you i mean it varies region to region i study
[03:27:03.700 --> 03:27:07.380]  this all the time but if i tell you specifically everything about canada
[03:27:07.380 --> 03:27:10.580]  you know more than i do though i i i read the canadian news
[03:27:10.580 --> 03:27:14.740]  i know that multiple states uh namely the one you're talking about
[03:27:14.740 --> 03:27:19.940]  uh did put this tax in locally that they are adding new gas taxes they are
[03:27:19.940 --> 03:27:24.020]  adding new home inspection rules the eu was announced that you won't be
[03:27:24.020 --> 03:27:26.500]  allowed to have single family dwellings period
[03:27:26.500 --> 03:27:30.500]  within nine years within six years they won't be able to be given new permits
[03:27:30.500 --> 03:27:36.260]  i mean this is this controls everything uh and so take austin
[03:27:36.260 --> 03:27:40.500]  they can't get the congress to pass it uh even with their oil spill
[03:27:40.500 --> 03:27:44.260]  so obama says he's just going to implement it by executive order
[03:27:44.260 --> 03:27:49.300]  uh in austin the city council uh has gotten a un award i mean it was in the
[03:27:49.300 --> 03:27:52.980]  un announced on the floor two months ago praising austin
[03:27:52.980 --> 03:27:56.260]  when they passed 2.6 billion in taxes on us
[03:27:56.260 --> 03:28:00.980]  has nothing to do they just say it's green your power bill went up it's green
[03:28:00.980 --> 03:28:04.020]  uh so they're going to rape us every angle they can
[03:28:04.020 --> 03:28:09.380]  uh tracker boxes in our cars that texas england's already starting it
[03:28:09.380 --> 03:28:12.980]  texas is already paying drivers to be part of a test program to do it
[03:28:12.980 --> 03:28:16.660]  so i mean they're just gonna disguise the limit whatever they can pass they're
[03:28:16.660 --> 03:28:20.260]  going to do they're going to throw every bit of mud they can against the wall
[03:28:20.260 --> 03:28:23.300]  and know that some of it's going to stick and they never stop
[03:28:23.300 --> 03:28:27.140]  i mean that's the thing about these crooks two
[03:28:27.140 --> 03:28:31.700]  two different uh prime ministers have been thrown out in
[03:28:31.700 --> 03:28:35.780]  in um excuse me in australia one just in england over this
[03:28:35.780 --> 03:28:39.460]  and the next person that comes in whether it's australia england
[03:28:39.460 --> 03:28:43.220]  uh the prime minister of canada you know three four years ago before he was
[03:28:43.220 --> 03:28:46.660]  prime minister he would criticize carbon taxes now he's for it
[03:28:46.660 --> 03:28:50.740]  i mean look at the new labor leader uh over in england
[03:28:50.740 --> 03:28:54.900]  uh you know he supports it look at the new tori who's the prime minister
[03:28:54.900 --> 03:28:59.700]  he supports carbon tax uh this is what the globalist want this is their whole
[03:28:59.700 --> 03:29:03.300]  program and so i don't know i mean it's just whatever
[03:29:03.300 --> 03:29:07.620]  they can get they're going to do that's exactly what they've done with the hst
[03:29:07.620 --> 03:29:10.580]  here as well as harmonized sales tax we've already got a
[03:29:10.580 --> 03:29:15.220]  municipal tax provincial tax uh federal tax now this hst what it's
[03:29:15.220 --> 03:29:18.980]  going to do is give the corporation's power to tax everything this is
[03:29:18.980 --> 03:29:22.660]  restaurants everything you buy everything you eat to survive
[03:29:22.660 --> 03:29:26.500]  and they're going to pass on the savings to us of course
[03:29:26.500 --> 03:29:30.660]  of course my my you know what but this is what we're doing here and again

[03:32:05.140 --> 03:32:08.980]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric

[03:32:12.340 --> 03:32:15.140]  how much power your electric company allows you to have
[03:32:15.140 --> 03:32:18.100]  it's true total government control of electricity
[03:32:18.100 --> 03:32:21.620]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three
[03:32:21.620 --> 03:32:25.220]  in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[03:32:25.220 --> 03:32:29.140]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[03:32:29.140 --> 03:32:32.660]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[03:32:32.660 --> 03:32:35.780]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related

[03:36:10.740 --> 03:36:14.100]  back in the days of the newsletter he was one of the icons out there you know
[03:36:14.100 --> 03:36:16.660]  before there was a computer is warning police and military
[03:36:16.660 --> 03:36:20.100]  with his operation vampire killer two thousand other publications
[03:36:20.100 --> 03:36:24.020]  and he has the sources now he was the first to report on this now i've
[03:36:24.020 --> 03:36:27.380]  separately seen a gentleman with zimmerman oil talking about it
[03:36:27.380 --> 03:36:30.740]  i've seen other news articles out there by a bunch of publications
[03:36:30.740 --> 03:36:34.820]  uh... you know saying this is the word but i wanted to go specifically to jack
[03:36:34.820 --> 03:36:38.020]  mclam you know after we see this footage out of phoenix
[03:36:38.020 --> 03:36:41.780]  arizona of senator kyle s and i talked to this with lord
[03:36:41.780 --> 03:36:45.940]  montan last hour coming out and saying look i was in a private
[03:36:45.940 --> 03:36:49.940]  meeting with obama president obama and he told me i'm only the border open
[03:36:49.940 --> 03:36:52.820]  as a way to hold the american people hostage with all the crime and murder
[03:36:52.820 --> 03:36:57.300]  down there so they'll pass amnesty which is just legalization
[03:36:57.300 --> 03:37:02.580]  and that's what they're doing uh... so yeah they'll let a crisis go to
[03:37:02.580 --> 03:37:05.620]  uh... you know they won't let a good crisis go to waste
[03:37:05.620 --> 03:37:08.500]  we know they're blocking all the oil skimmers blocking the
[03:37:08.500 --> 03:37:12.180]  estuary dams blocking the sand berms i mean
[03:37:12.180 --> 03:37:16.100]  out there actually blocking it so we know they're blocking it premeditatedly
[03:37:16.100 --> 03:37:19.540]  and using a crisis so they're now aiding in a bedding and and
[03:37:19.540 --> 03:37:23.620]  becoming uh... part of the event so that's the same thing is staging it
[03:37:23.620 --> 03:37:27.860]  and we know they gave anna darko and haliburton the orders that's in the
[03:37:27.860 --> 03:37:31.780]  coast guard testimony from the people on board to do things that aren't done on
[03:37:31.780 --> 03:37:36.420]  oil rigs that they knew would blow up but more and more the evidence is that
[03:37:36.420 --> 03:37:39.060]  there may that there was an unscheduled change
[03:37:39.060 --> 03:37:42.100]  two hours before something that wasn't authorized
[03:37:42.100 --> 03:37:45.300]  and now we'll get that intel from officer jack mclam
[03:37:45.300 --> 03:37:48.740]  from his sources that obviously will go unnamed because they don't want to get a
[03:37:48.740 --> 03:37:51.060]  bullet in the head that's what he told me during the break
[03:37:51.060 --> 03:37:54.500]  uh... jack good to have you on with us good to be on with you alex
[03:37:54.500 --> 03:37:58.420]  thanks for all you do for god and country well i try and thank you sir
[03:37:58.420 --> 03:38:02.660]  okay as much as you can tell us as you've been saying this is really early on
[03:38:02.660 --> 03:38:05.940]  that you were the first what did your intel sources and
[03:38:05.940 --> 03:38:09.300]  federal law enforcement local police and military tell you about what's really
[03:38:09.300 --> 03:38:14.340]  going on in the gulf well it's uh... all state
[03:38:14.340 --> 03:38:18.900]  it's all state they had uh... as you said
[03:38:18.900 --> 03:38:24.260]  very strange the bureau of land management on their two hours before the
[03:38:24.260 --> 03:38:29.300]  bomb went off and uh... they they were doing a very
[03:38:29.300 --> 03:38:33.300]  uncharacteristic inspection of an oil rig
[03:38:33.300 --> 03:38:36.980]  which the bureau of land management doesn't do
[03:38:36.980 --> 03:38:42.420]  and uh... then two hours after they left the bomb went off blew up the oil rig
[03:38:42.420 --> 03:38:46.420]  you know so it was all a false flag operation
[03:38:46.420 --> 03:38:50.340]  to help the uh...
[03:38:50.340 --> 03:38:56.580]  the oil barons make more money and stop the finding of oil
[03:38:56.580 --> 03:39:01.060]  in these offshore oil rig because they're monopoly men just like bp gets
[03:39:01.060 --> 03:39:04.180]  eighty percent of the alaskan oil right and of course they're the big carbon
[03:39:04.180 --> 03:39:06.980]  tax pushers but was this a military source of police
[03:39:06.980 --> 03:39:09.940]  source was it one source multiple sources i mean
[03:39:09.940 --> 03:39:14.980]  give us an idea it was multiple sources and and let me get my timeline right
[03:39:14.980 --> 03:39:17.220]  when did you first start getting this intel
[03:39:17.220 --> 03:39:22.980]  oh about a month ago yeah about a month ago
[03:39:22.980 --> 03:39:28.900]  and uh... all all the people that uh... i talked to and contacted and they
[03:39:28.900 --> 03:39:32.820]  contacted me are scared to death
[03:39:32.820 --> 03:39:36.660]  uh... of of being executed if they
[03:39:36.660 --> 03:39:41.300]  if anybody finds out that they talked to me about it
[03:39:41.300 --> 03:39:45.140]  yeah and as you say zack Zimmerman are the
[03:39:45.140 --> 03:39:48.500]  is the one that put out that the bureau of land management
[03:39:48.500 --> 03:39:52.100]  did an uncharacteristic surprise inspection
[03:39:52.100 --> 03:39:57.700]  the day the oil rig blew up and they were on that oil rig the
[03:39:57.700 --> 03:40:02.900]  the bureau of land management doesn't do oil rig inspections but they were on
[03:40:02.900 --> 03:40:06.740]  this one and two hours after they left it blew up
[03:40:06.740 --> 03:40:11.780]  so these uh... sources that have contacted me
[03:40:11.780 --> 03:40:17.060]  believe that uh... it was all a false flag operation to
[03:40:17.060 --> 03:40:20.900]  also fill the the concentration camps
[03:40:20.900 --> 03:40:24.580]  they they're talking about picking up 40 to 15
[03:40:24.580 --> 03:40:27.940]  thousand people and putting them in these
[03:40:27.940 --> 03:40:31.860]  hella Burton concentration now i saw that i see
[03:40:31.860 --> 03:40:35.060]  again then that's all sold like after Katrina as if it's a good thing i remember
[03:40:35.060 --> 03:40:39.300]  seeing that a month ago and then they did deploy the military and now the EPA is
[03:40:39.300 --> 03:40:43.140]  talking about evacuating some areas and they're now calling it tilt
[03:40:43.140 --> 03:40:46.820]  uh... uh... roiders and others are reporting that people are getting sick
[03:40:46.820 --> 03:40:51.060]  two of the workers have died a captain's committed suicide
[03:40:51.060 --> 03:40:54.980]  so we know they've been lying about the toxicity right uh... but but uh...
[03:40:54.980 --> 03:40:58.500]  my intel is they are at least exacerbating this
[03:40:58.500 --> 03:41:01.620]  to get their carbon tax pass and now obama
[03:41:01.620 --> 03:41:06.820]  Barry Sotaro is out promoting that it's also a smoke screen for the iran
[03:41:06.820 --> 03:41:10.420]  attack they've got geared up but specifically
[03:41:10.420 --> 03:41:13.780]  you know you have broken many government documents
[03:41:13.780 --> 03:41:17.620]  in the past literally hundreds of times the the phoenix memo
[03:41:17.620 --> 03:41:21.220]  back in 98 saying patriots and gun owners were terrorist
[03:41:21.220 --> 03:41:24.580]  uh... you know just a new version of that we got from law enforcement last year
[03:41:24.580 --> 03:41:28.500]  mayak and homeland security reports uh... so i mean jack you have broken a lot of
[03:41:28.500 --> 03:41:32.180]  key news and we respect your your your sources but i mean any
[03:41:32.180 --> 03:41:36.340]  other details that they can uh... that your sources gave you i mean were these
[03:41:36.340 --> 03:41:39.220]  eyewitnesses or were they told by other law enforcement
[03:41:39.220 --> 03:41:41.860]  or i mean i mean give us as much specifics as you can
[03:41:41.860 --> 03:41:45.300]  well they just said that they were in meetings
[03:41:45.300 --> 03:41:49.780]  where this was talked about blowing up this oil rig
[03:41:49.780 --> 03:41:57.220]  and uh... of course the oil barons are part of the communist Zionist
[03:41:57.220 --> 03:42:00.740]  uh... controllers of our nation today
[03:42:00.740 --> 03:42:05.220]  and they were in meetings talking about they were going to blow this thing up
[03:42:05.220 --> 03:42:11.540]  so we had wachovia who is owned by welfar go bank
[03:42:11.540 --> 03:42:16.260]  sell two and a half million shares two weeks before it blew up
[03:42:16.260 --> 03:42:22.500]  swiss bank ubs sold two million shares 97 percent of their stock and
[03:42:22.500 --> 03:42:28.020]  wachovia sold 98 percent of their bp stock
[03:42:28.020 --> 03:42:32.580]  and goldman sacks sold 44 percent of their bp stock
[03:42:32.580 --> 03:42:37.940]  and uh... tony hayward the ceo of bp that's
[03:42:37.940 --> 03:42:44.580]  that on the news a lot today sold all of his stock 1.4 million worth of bp stock
[03:42:44.580 --> 03:42:47.700]  just a couple weeks before the bomb went off
[03:42:47.700 --> 03:42:51.940]  so it's the same as 9-11 brother i thought it was 33 percent but then i
[03:42:51.940 --> 03:42:55.780]  already had sold even more later and then goldman sacks sold 44 percent of
[03:42:55.780 --> 03:43:00.740]  their stock right uh... but uh...
[03:43:00.740 --> 03:43:04.660]  now when you talk about israel involvement uh...
[03:43:04.660 --> 03:43:08.580]  i hadn't really i mean federal government blm i mean this whole
[03:43:08.580 --> 03:43:13.140]  combine of interest uh wanting to push for but i do see it as a distraction
[03:43:13.140 --> 03:43:17.380]  as israel and u.s forces do openly say they may nuke iran
[03:43:17.380 --> 03:43:20.020]  and why that's just going to be terrible and then the iranians say they're going
[03:43:20.020 --> 03:43:23.540]  to try to break the gaza blockade which is insane
[03:43:23.540 --> 03:43:27.860]  and that i mean i mean we don't want war here we want all these sides to
[03:43:27.860 --> 03:43:32.020]  to stop what they're doing so so you specifically talked
[03:43:32.020 --> 03:43:37.300]  to sources uh... law enforcement military who were in meetings
[03:43:37.300 --> 03:43:41.140]  when they were talking about government blew it up or may have blown it up
[03:43:41.140 --> 03:43:45.620]  yes or or they were in meetings talking about how they were going to blow it up
[03:43:45.620 --> 03:43:49.860]  uh... how they were going to this was before it happened
[03:43:49.860 --> 03:43:54.180]  and uh... so halliburton was on that oil rig
[03:43:54.180 --> 03:43:59.220]  just hours before it blew up in the bureau of land management was there too
[03:43:59.220 --> 03:44:03.700]  so one of those organizations planted the bomb
[03:44:03.700 --> 03:44:11.060]  on the oil rig according to my sources
[03:44:11.060 --> 03:44:15.300]  well i wish those sources could uh... i would think they'd be in more danger
[03:44:15.300 --> 03:44:16.740]  not speaking out
[03:44:16.740 --> 03:44:20.980]  i mean uh... i mean i can't imagine government or corporate espionage groups
[03:44:20.980 --> 03:44:24.340]  having more than three or four people in a meeting where this would be discussed
[03:44:24.340 --> 03:44:26.740]  that's something you'd keep compartmentalized so
[03:44:26.740 --> 03:44:32.260]  oh yes it's definitely compartmentalized but i have contacts i had a
[03:44:32.260 --> 03:44:38.020]  top secret clearance during the vietnam war and was back on the secret intel
[03:44:38.020 --> 03:44:42.740]  basis and made a lot of contact with intel people
[03:44:42.740 --> 03:44:47.700]  weren't you in cambodia no i never went to camp oh no that was that that was a
[03:44:47.700 --> 03:44:50.980]  butch paul was in black ops in cambodia that's right yeah
[03:44:50.980 --> 03:44:56.900]  no i i wanted to uh... i was seventeen eighteen years of age
[03:44:56.900 --> 03:45:02.020]  when i was uh... i've enlisted when i was seventeen
[03:45:02.020 --> 03:45:07.140]  and i was the first american sixteen year old
[03:45:07.140 --> 03:45:12.340]  that was taken by the navy divers and taught to use scuba gear and
[03:45:12.340 --> 03:45:16.660]  certified in scuba gear in washington district of criminals
[03:45:16.660 --> 03:45:23.540]  and uh... so i went to my uh... recruiter and i told him that i was
[03:45:23.540 --> 03:45:27.700]  certified in scuba gear by the navy divers and wanted to be part of the
[03:45:27.700 --> 03:45:32.180]  udt the underwater demolition team they they're called the fields today
[03:45:32.180 --> 03:45:37.380]  that's jesse ventura yeah yeah and uh... they said the recruiter says sure
[03:45:37.380 --> 03:45:41.220]  signed here so i was stupid enough to sign up
[03:45:41.220 --> 03:45:45.300]  and then they put me back in these intel bases in the jungle
[03:45:45.300 --> 03:45:50.580]  with a top secret clearance and and it helped because i met a lot of people
[03:45:50.580 --> 03:45:53.540]  that were no jack we know that i mean you've had the premier organization
[03:45:53.540 --> 03:45:55.940]  police and military against the new world order and all these sources
[03:45:55.940 --> 03:45:59.700]  yeah i just this is pretty big i mean i i mean i believe you have these sources
[03:45:59.700 --> 03:46:02.340]  and you brought i mean it's just it's amazing
[03:46:02.340 --> 03:46:06.500]  uh... to be here talking to you and you're saying you've got multiple sources
[03:46:06.500 --> 03:46:10.180]  uh... who who i mean one source
[03:46:10.180 --> 03:46:13.540]  to be specific who said they were in on a meeting when the government was
[03:46:13.540 --> 03:46:16.820]  discussing uh... sabotaging it with an explosive
[03:46:16.820 --> 03:46:20.740]  or two people or do you have people two people
[03:46:20.740 --> 03:46:24.100]  or or okay and you have and you said other sources
[03:46:24.100 --> 03:46:28.260]  i mean do you have any other intel from what people generally in law
[03:46:28.260 --> 03:46:33.140]  enforcement think well uh... i was called the other
[03:46:33.140 --> 03:46:38.180]  day and uh... was told i was going to get an email
[03:46:38.180 --> 03:46:42.340]  and i got an email that cheney and bush
[03:46:42.340 --> 03:46:46.580]  and hallowbert and purchase purchased a oil cleaning firm
[03:46:46.580 --> 03:46:51.700]  two weeks before the blow up of the oil platform boots and could you know that
[03:46:51.700 --> 03:46:55.140]  that's confirmed yeah right and uh... so
[03:46:55.140 --> 03:46:58.980]  i i'm getting some good information it's just uh...
[03:46:58.980 --> 03:47:05.700]  and then now we have a scared bp insider predicted
[03:47:05.700 --> 03:47:09.780]  that uh... it was blown up on purpose you know
[03:47:09.780 --> 03:47:12.820]  we have denise whitney now he didn't give us
[03:47:12.820 --> 03:47:16.660]  his name but we went and traced his ip address
[03:47:16.660 --> 03:47:20.580]  back to denise whitney so he may end up dead
[03:47:20.580 --> 03:47:24.900]  but he's well that's not too good to talk yeah he's really scared
[03:47:24.900 --> 03:47:29.860]  okay well we'll try to be p insider and he said that uh...
[03:47:29.860 --> 03:47:34.340]  that it was blown up on purpose a false flag operation
[03:47:34.340 --> 03:47:37.780]  okay well they can also ip spoof so we'll have to look into that wow
[03:47:37.780 --> 03:47:41.540]  uh... jack mclam is our guest this is just getting
[03:47:41.540 --> 03:47:46.340]  crazier by the moment um well there's no doubt we're going into
[03:47:46.340 --> 03:47:49.060]  tyranny they're openly talking about shutting the web off
[03:47:49.060 --> 03:47:52.180]  they're openly talking about arresting dissidents they've got
[03:47:52.180 --> 03:47:55.300]  southern property law center reports the southern property law center called me
[03:47:55.300 --> 03:47:58.660]  by my first name they said oh alex isn't calling for violence
[03:47:58.660 --> 03:48:01.620]  but what he's saying will cause his followers to
[03:48:01.620 --> 03:48:04.660]  i mean they must really be concerned about us
[03:48:04.660 --> 03:48:07.380]  uh... if they're trying to demonize us i mean jack we've never called for
[03:48:07.380 --> 03:48:08.500]  violence have we
[03:48:08.500 --> 03:48:12.740]  no i haven't called for violence and you haven't either alex
[03:48:12.740 --> 03:48:18.020]  and uh so uh but the southern poverty pimp law center
[03:48:18.020 --> 03:48:22.180]  is a communist zionist led organization
[03:48:22.180 --> 03:48:27.940]  and they hate america just like the adl hates america and they want to see it
[03:48:27.940 --> 03:48:30.820]  destroyed so they're doing everything they
[03:48:30.820 --> 03:48:35.380]  can to destroy you me and everybody they can
[03:48:35.380 --> 03:48:40.740]  to that's trying to help save america
[03:48:40.740 --> 03:48:44.980]  yeah jack my whole issue on that front is um
[03:48:44.980 --> 03:48:48.180]  i know what the southern property law center and adl are bad guys
[03:48:48.180 --> 03:48:51.140]  i don't think that i mean to use the term zionist i don't think everybody that
[03:48:51.140 --> 03:48:53.620]  believes israel has a right to exist though
[03:48:53.620 --> 03:48:56.660]  is part of the overall new order operation i mean there are
[03:48:56.660 --> 03:49:00.500]  different variants and different groups out there that's true alex very
[03:49:00.500 --> 03:49:01.460]  true
[03:49:01.460 --> 03:49:05.140]  yeah i mean that's another issue though is that
[03:49:05.140 --> 03:49:10.420]  uh but i know betray us is bad news general betray us and known as betray us
[03:49:10.420 --> 03:49:14.180]  but this other guy micristal it was fingered as the one that covered up the
[03:49:14.180 --> 03:49:16.340]  pat tillman murder we know that was a murder
[03:49:16.340 --> 03:49:19.220]  that's right i mean it's come out that it was a cover up the line the army
[03:49:19.220 --> 03:49:23.220]  corners have said it was a murder yeah so we have that going on shot
[03:49:23.220 --> 03:49:26.100]  shot at a distance they came up and shot him three times in the head to make
[03:49:26.100 --> 03:49:27.380]  sure he was dead
[03:49:27.380 --> 03:49:31.060]  uh but then you expand on that
[03:49:31.060 --> 03:49:35.780]  uh micristal is builder bergatt indy he is a cfr fellow
[03:49:35.780 --> 03:49:39.780]  and so things must not be going well if a top globalist like micristal
[03:49:39.780 --> 03:49:43.860]  is removed by uh obama do you think that was just thin skin
[03:49:43.860 --> 03:49:49.060]  or uh what's the info you got on that front well i think that uh for what i'm
[03:49:49.060 --> 03:49:52.980]  hearing that micristal couldn't be trusted
[03:49:52.980 --> 03:49:56.900]  you know he was he was siding with america
[03:49:56.900 --> 03:50:03.940]  and um against the globalist and so even though he was a cfr
[03:50:03.940 --> 03:50:08.820]  and other other connections uh they say he couldn't be trusted
[03:50:08.820 --> 03:50:15.060]  and uh betray us uh general betray us can be trusted 100
[03:50:15.060 --> 03:50:20.180]  percent they say yeah i wonder if
[03:50:20.180 --> 03:50:23.220]  he didn't say the right thing at builder berg you know he was just there three
[03:50:23.220 --> 03:50:26.980]  weeks ago it's on record right uh the general micristal
[03:50:26.980 --> 03:50:32.180]  stanley micristal was there yeah and then meanwhile they said he fainted i i've
[03:50:32.180 --> 03:50:36.980]  seen people have seizures uh betray us clearly had a seizure
[03:50:36.980 --> 03:50:41.620]  that's true that's true so they're they're scared of
[03:50:41.620 --> 03:50:46.740]  micristal and so they've gotten rid of him and he may end up dead
[03:50:46.740 --> 03:50:50.260]  according to my sources well yeah he was in the delta force they don't actually
[03:50:50.260 --> 03:50:53.780]  like real warriors they like uh people that are having seizures that's right
[03:50:53.780 --> 03:50:58.100]  yeah they like fainters not fighters stay there uh let's come back and of

[03:54:09.700 --> 03:54:12.260]  guy i asked him i said why don't you give this
[03:54:12.260 --> 03:54:15.860]  pp inside of it sent you an email's name out
[03:54:15.860 --> 03:54:20.420]  and uh he said well because the his name was on the ip address and the
[03:54:20.420 --> 03:54:22.820]  government reads all the email that comes into my office
[03:54:22.820 --> 03:54:25.460]  which of course they do they won't know what law enforcement military are
[03:54:25.460 --> 03:54:28.660]  thinking that's why if you're gonna send an email folks you need to send it from
[03:54:28.660 --> 03:54:32.820]  a dummy account uh or something else uh and so
[03:54:32.820 --> 03:54:35.780]  that's a good point jack made that he's trying to protect that person
[03:54:35.780 --> 03:54:38.820]  but who knows that could have been a spoof name as well there's all sorts of
[03:54:38.820 --> 03:54:42.100]  tricks uh on the web when we've gotten law
[03:54:42.100 --> 03:54:47.540]  enforcement military uh intel type stuff we first call make phone calls
[03:54:47.540 --> 03:54:53.300]  confirm it's accurate and then we erase all the material
[03:54:53.300 --> 03:54:57.300]  you know the communications we received believe me you get an fbi document you
[03:54:57.300 --> 03:55:01.780]  call the fbi agents names up with a control number they start freaking out
[03:55:01.780 --> 03:55:04.900]  and then you know it's real plus you know how to read this stuff after a while
[03:55:04.900 --> 03:55:08.020]  and tell if it's real uh but we'll continue to investigate
[03:55:08.020 --> 03:55:12.340]  this uh overall but officer jack mclam is our guest
[03:55:12.340 --> 03:55:16.500]  don't forget my websites are info wars dot com and prison planet dot tv
[03:55:16.500 --> 03:55:19.300]  and don't think it's because you're awake to what's happening your friends and
[03:55:19.300 --> 03:55:22.580]  family are they're ready to be awakened now is the
[03:55:22.580 --> 03:55:26.260]  time and it's life and death that we expose this system
[03:55:26.260 --> 03:55:30.500]  uh jack uh i mean america finally
[03:55:30.500 --> 03:55:34.820]  realizes we're going into tyranny and you got all these corrupt special
[03:55:34.820 --> 03:55:37.700]  interests that are just in a free for all looting this country and other
[03:55:37.700 --> 03:55:42.020]  nations uh i just uh hope people pray for this
[03:55:42.020 --> 03:55:45.380]  nation i hope they do too i ask them every day
[03:55:45.380 --> 03:55:51.540]  on my show to pray for the nation yeah let me say something alex
[03:55:51.540 --> 03:55:58.260]  i'm uh really happy that you said what you did about there's a lot of good
[03:55:58.260 --> 03:56:04.900]  jews out there and i have five uh
[03:56:04.900 --> 03:56:11.220]  website written by millions and millions of jews against the communist
[03:56:11.220 --> 03:56:15.620]  zionist we have jews versus zionist dot
[03:56:15.620 --> 03:56:20.820]  wordpress.com we've got jews against zionist.com
[03:56:20.820 --> 03:56:26.900]  jews not zionist.org and so millions and millions of jews have gotten
[03:56:26.900 --> 03:56:31.220]  together to stand up and talk against the communist zionists
[03:56:31.220 --> 03:56:37.940]  who are have been in control of israel since 1948 and are still in control of
[03:56:37.940 --> 03:56:42.980]  them today and are causing all the wars and causing all the violence over
[03:56:42.980 --> 03:56:47.860]  there they created hamas 20 years ago to bomb them
[03:56:47.860 --> 03:56:51.780]  regularly every few weeks and they created the
[03:56:51.780 --> 03:56:55.860]  hamas organization to bomb them so that they could destroy the
[03:56:55.860 --> 03:57:00.420]  balance jack here's my issue though uh is that i've run into
[03:57:00.420 --> 03:57:03.860]  different groups that say catholics are all evil and run everything or jews are
[03:57:03.860 --> 03:57:07.380]  all evil and run everything i'm just trying to fight the new world order
[03:57:07.380 --> 03:57:10.260]  and trying to get everybody together against the new world order and one of
[03:57:10.260 --> 03:57:14.260]  those sites you mentioned makes up outlandish things that are 100
[03:57:14.260 --> 03:57:18.420]  percent false uh about me and so you know that's my
[03:57:18.420 --> 03:57:22.180]  issue is criticizing israel and some of the different veins of zionism because
[03:57:22.180 --> 03:57:25.140]  for me and the research there's a lot of different flavors of it
[03:57:25.140 --> 03:57:28.820]  uh you know that's one thing and we have guests on the do that
[03:57:28.820 --> 03:57:32.900]  uh you know my only other issue is is that i've seen from the camp that
[03:57:32.900 --> 03:57:38.900]  thinks literally israel is b lz bob uh i've seen a lot of dishonesty uh from
[03:57:38.900 --> 03:57:42.900]  you know those crowds and just just you know just amazing stuff but
[03:57:42.900 --> 03:57:47.460]  there's no doubt israel is pushing to start a war with iran and i am firmly
[03:57:47.460 --> 03:57:52.020]  against that and i'm firmly against all this aid to all these foreign countries
[03:57:52.020 --> 03:57:55.300]  i believe in what george washington said i ran out of time for taylor
