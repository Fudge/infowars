[00:00.000 --> 00:11.520]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.520 --> 00:19.080]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.080 --> 00:33.040]  Texas Alex Jones everybody knows that we fire and forget we move forward we
[00:33.040 --> 00:37.120]  aim at the target we pull the trigger we move on to the next target that's
[00:37.120 --> 00:40.640]  attacking tyranny waging war on corruption crashing through lies and
[00:40.640 --> 00:47.160]  disinformation one month ago I called Paul Watson and I got all my reporters in
[00:47.160 --> 00:52.920]  a room and I said here's a UN and here's a CDC report and here are major
[00:52.920 --> 00:59.160]  medical journals saying Ebola was confirmed to be somewhat airborne two
[00:59.160 --> 01:04.480]  years ago in 2012 and it's clearly mutated here that the mainstream
[01:04.480 --> 01:11.680]  documents on that and it is replicating and spreading at ten times the
[01:11.680 --> 01:16.360]  previous worst outbreak six years ago I said I'm no medical doctor or
[01:16.360 --> 01:21.580]  virologist but I'm reading what all the top ones say as an analyst this is going
[01:21.580 --> 01:26.280]  to be a gigantic outbreak on top of what's already happened and it's
[01:26.280 --> 01:31.680]  clearly somewhat airborne it's just stating longer and we were attacked let
[01:31.680 --> 01:38.080]  me not exaggerate a month ago let me not exaggerate by tens of thousands of
[01:38.080 --> 01:44.000]  publications AP attacked as others did that was in thousands of publications
[01:44.000 --> 01:48.760]  alone you could type in info wars.com Ebola and see the stuff from a month
[01:48.760 --> 01:52.080]  ago Paul Watson's doing a video on it he's doing a report on it we're gonna
[01:52.080 --> 01:56.360]  do a special report Sunday it's not about defending info wars it's about
[01:56.360 --> 02:02.200]  understanding our propaganda works we presented documents we presented fact
[02:02.200 --> 02:08.240]  we tried to warn people and we said it may not end up you know infecting the
[02:08.240 --> 02:13.360]  rest of the world but it is gonna ravage Africa you know what the headline
[02:13.360 --> 02:18.360]  today is on drugs from the New York Times so so now the New York Times said
[02:18.360 --> 02:22.640]  it it's true just like the New York Times three weeks after we proved with
[02:22.640 --> 02:30.960]  video and the city manager of Kingsville of McAllen and video where the
[02:30.960 --> 02:37.440]  Border Patrol told us to go our ice whistleblower we went and showed the
[02:37.440 --> 02:40.920]  Border Patrol loading them on buses and giving them vouchers the illegals we
[02:40.920 --> 02:46.520]  broke that and we were attacked people said it was it true and we took the
[02:46.520 --> 02:55.200]  mainline documentation and we put it in articles and it went viral pun intended
[02:55.200 --> 03:00.280]  and then we got attacked just like they said three years ago we were lying there
[03:00.280 --> 03:03.400]  were no domestic surveillance drones even though we were covering local
[03:03.400 --> 03:06.960]  newspaper articles just like they said there were no death panels in Obamacare
[03:06.960 --> 03:11.000]  just like they said that we weren't funding Al Qaeda in Syria now it's
[03:11.000 --> 03:18.440]  admitted the truth is my show is not radical I get radically upset I try to
[03:18.440 --> 03:22.920]  get people to wake up I jump around naturally because I'm upset that's not a
[03:22.920 --> 03:27.480]  manipulation that I get up here and get upset but it works because people are in
[03:27.480 --> 03:32.000]  a coma and it's time for folks out there to get out of their comfort zones and
[03:32.000 --> 03:38.360]  realize we're in danger and here's the headline out of the New York Times what
[03:38.360 --> 03:42.840]  we're afraid to say about Ebola and they talked to the virologist in the
[03:42.840 --> 03:52.440]  World Health Organization and they say it's going airborne there you go so
[03:52.440 --> 04:00.040]  we're gonna have Paul Watson and my reporters put together articles showing
[04:00.040 --> 04:04.840]  videos and the articles where we said this one month ago and we're attacked
[04:04.840 --> 04:15.640]  there it is August 4th 2014 Paul Joseph Watson and let's scroll back down he
[04:15.640 --> 04:20.080]  wrote that two days after I told him to's let's go back to the top CDC
[04:20.080 --> 04:26.440]  concerned about airborne transmission of Ebola virus federal agency directs
[04:26.440 --> 04:30.240]  airline staff prevent spread of infectious material through the air
[04:30.240 --> 04:34.120]  Obama then signed an executive order saying for any respiratory illness you
[04:34.120 --> 04:37.560]  can be detained and the media said oh well that was just a reassurance of
[04:37.560 --> 04:42.400]  Bush's order but it expanded it to any respiratory problem not just specific
[04:42.400 --> 04:49.200]  known pathogens so we broke it we were right it's confirmed it was confirmed
[04:49.200 --> 04:52.800]  then we're gonna break it all down because now they're saying it's
[04:52.800 --> 04:58.440]  uncontainable I don't know if that's true we're gonna report
[04:58.440 --> 05:02.560]  after consulting top doctors nutritionists pharmacists and others we
[05:02.560 --> 05:08.040]  have developed what I believe is the ultimate non GMO organic super male

[10:25.400 --> 10:30.840]  dot com and info wars dot com right now a month ago
[10:30.840 --> 10:38.200]  or back on august 4th paul watson wrote the article
[10:38.200 --> 10:40.920]  because i called my reporters in and i called him on the phone
[10:40.920 --> 10:45.800]  he's in england we're here in austin texas and i said hey
[10:45.800 --> 10:50.040]  i've got a stack of government reports cdc
[10:50.040 --> 10:55.960]  u.n. world health organization reports i've got mainline medical journals 2012
[10:55.960 --> 11:03.560]  saying that clearly monkeys to pigs in african studies
[11:03.560 --> 11:10.680]  has been transferring the virus through the air
[11:10.680 --> 11:13.320]  and i said i want articles written about this so
[11:13.320 --> 11:15.720]  watson did write an article and for tv viewers
[11:15.720 --> 11:19.400]  we'll put that article up on screen also print me another copy of that guys
[11:19.400 --> 11:23.320]  thank you cdc concerned about airborne transmission
[11:23.320 --> 11:26.920]  of a bolivirus federal agency directs airline staff to prevent
[11:26.920 --> 11:31.640]  spread of infectious material through the air
[11:32.360 --> 11:34.600]  now
[11:35.240 --> 11:38.040]  drudge
[11:39.080 --> 11:45.720]  carried links at the time to the actual studies
[11:45.720 --> 11:54.520]  but drudge also linked some of our articles and info wars dot com
[11:54.520 --> 12:01.320]  then literally thousands of publications ap you name it which is then
[12:01.320 --> 12:05.240]  in tens of thousands of publications when ap puts it out
[12:05.240 --> 12:09.800]  came out and said there is no airborne Ebola everything's fine
[12:09.800 --> 12:12.840]  don't listen to alex jones don't listen to matt drudge
[12:12.840 --> 12:17.560]  when all we were doing was writing articles or linking to articles
[12:17.560 --> 12:22.040]  that had been written two years ago in prestigious scientific virology
[12:22.040 --> 12:25.400]  publications about the fact that it was becoming airborne
[12:25.400 --> 12:28.360]  not super airborne where it drifts around like
[12:28.360 --> 12:32.760]  anthrax in the air and can live for years
[12:33.400 --> 12:37.240]  but airborne enough that if it gets in spit or mucus
[12:37.240 --> 12:40.840]  it can float through the air and you can get it and now it takes weeks to show
[12:40.840 --> 12:45.480]  up so it spreads because it doesn't get identified
[12:46.200 --> 12:50.200]  and there is the myth article the most destructive myths about a bolivirus
[12:50.200 --> 12:54.760]  debunked a bolivirus is airborne waterborne or spreads through casual
[12:54.760 --> 13:01.160]  contact that was in the huffington post
[13:02.600 --> 13:07.160]  and they and many others attacked us in a whole bunch of stories
[13:07.160 --> 13:10.680]  that that but look at drudge being irresponsible look at alex jones look at
[13:10.680 --> 13:14.360]  info wars they're fear mongering
[13:14.360 --> 13:17.720]  and saying it's mutating and saying that it's becoming airborne
[13:17.720 --> 13:25.000]  we didn't say that we were up info wars wrote articles
[13:25.000 --> 13:32.840]  linking to the mainline medical studies and clearly Ebola is more aggressive
[13:32.840 --> 13:37.080]  now at the time it was already 10 times a
[13:37.080 --> 13:39.640]  month ago back on august 4th over a month ago
[13:39.640 --> 13:45.640]  10 times the previous number of people getting infected at the rate it was
[13:45.640 --> 13:50.920]  now it's way over that there's almost 3 000 dead right now
[13:50.920 --> 13:57.320]  there's over 250 mutations they've confirmed as it spreads across africa
[13:59.960 --> 14:03.960]  and the media has been whitewashing it i remember numbers uh two years ago that
[14:03.960 --> 14:08.120]  there were more than 200 000 rebels attacking the Assad regime
[14:08.120 --> 14:12.200]  and that most of them were al-qaeda affiliated
[14:12.200 --> 14:16.440]  65 was the number the media put out it's more like 95 percent now we know
[14:16.440 --> 14:20.040]  today i saw an article the cia says there's
[14:20.040 --> 14:24.760]  thousands thousands and thousands and thousands why
[14:24.760 --> 14:32.040]  13 000 isis people in syria 13 000 there were hundreds of thousands and then
[14:32.040 --> 14:36.680]  half of them or so went into iraq the other half have stayed in syria to loot
[14:36.680 --> 14:39.720]  they ran out of stuff to loot in syria so they went into iraq i mean it's just
[14:39.720 --> 14:43.800]  constant whitewashing now here's the headline today
[14:43.800 --> 14:48.920]  doc warns of airborne obola and it's not info wars dot com
[14:48.920 --> 14:53.960]  it's the precious new york times
[14:54.440 --> 15:00.840]  and here is the story here are some of the headlines
[15:00.840 --> 15:06.760]  obola is devouring everything in its path could it lead to Liberia's collapse washington post
[15:06.760 --> 15:10.680]  the daily beast obola's terrifying evolution i thought it wasn't evolving i
[15:10.680 --> 15:13.640]  thought i was a liar obola virus biological war in
[15:13.640 --> 15:17.400]  Liberia bbc obola outpaces global response
[15:17.400 --> 15:20.600]  world health organization says new york times and here's the new york times
[15:20.600 --> 15:23.000]  article
[15:24.440 --> 15:28.440]  where they basically break down the fact that
[15:28.440 --> 15:34.520]  it's starting to go airborne it's it's not crawling now it's starting to walk
[15:34.520 --> 15:38.920]  and then if it runs it'll turn to the flash
[15:38.920 --> 15:42.520]  and remember what dr peonka at the biology department at ut the ugenesis
[15:42.520 --> 15:45.480]  said about how soon the airborne obola would come
[15:45.480 --> 15:49.320]  and wipes the earth clean of the human scourge and that he and his family were
[15:49.320 --> 15:52.120]  ready to die i made a film about it it's called
[15:52.120 --> 15:59.880]  end game end game blueprint for global enslavement
[15:59.880 --> 16:04.360]  three hours long 30 minutes of it's really three or four films
[16:04.360 --> 16:08.600]  but 30 minutes of it as chapters is on airborne obola
[16:08.600 --> 16:11.960]  so i made the film eight years ago it's evergreen
[16:11.960 --> 16:15.560]  for the folks that know what that means that means it gets more alive
[16:15.560 --> 16:20.120]  and doesn't die and gets more important that film
[16:20.120 --> 16:24.760]  fbi comes out synthetic biological could reduce our population
[16:24.760 --> 16:28.360]  synthetic biology has been quietly inserted into the food supply
[16:28.360 --> 16:31.960]  i was so concerned and to give them credit the fbi was so concerned by end
[16:31.960 --> 16:35.720]  game they went and interviewed peonka then he
[16:35.720 --> 16:39.560]  was on the news and went i don't want anybody to die man
[16:39.560 --> 16:43.080]  they came to him and they said you're over the biology department
[16:43.080 --> 16:46.440]  and some of your graduate students have responded to mr jones we have their
[16:46.440 --> 16:50.120]  open letters here saying that all humans need to die
[16:50.120 --> 16:53.720]  do you have any knowledge of anyone in the lab with access to deadly
[16:53.720 --> 16:56.680]  biologicals that might be considering using them
[16:56.680 --> 17:01.800]  now now that's a normal behavior of the fbi that's what you're supposed to do
[17:01.800 --> 17:05.080]  you're supposed to when you got people over biology departments
[17:05.080 --> 17:09.080]  talking about stuff how about how wonderful it's me when everybody dies
[17:09.080 --> 17:12.760]  you need to go visit them and they did go visit them because i guess they love
[17:12.760 --> 17:15.720]  their children i'll guarantee you though they got reprimanded
[17:15.720 --> 17:19.480]  little bird told me they got called off that real quick so
[17:19.480 --> 17:25.960]  that's what's going on here ladies and gentlemen it's 12 monkeys for real

[17:51.400 --> 17:55.080]  to detain anyone with a respiratory illness and it's because of abola and
[17:55.080 --> 17:58.120]  they claim abola could be going airborne well

[18:03.400 --> 18:11.240]  i'm lying well paul watson's article link to the cdc statements

[18:27.080 --> 18:30.840]  you tell that when the when the when the head of the world health organization's
[18:30.840 --> 18:34.360]  virology department comes out and says a hundred thousand will have it
[18:34.360 --> 18:37.960]  in africa by december and now they've got other virologists saying
[18:37.960 --> 18:43.960]  five million will die i don't know but i know the black plague killed at least
[18:43.960 --> 18:47.160]  a third of europe an estimated 10 million
[18:47.160 --> 18:52.360]  back at the time when there was only 30 million people in all of europe
[18:52.360 --> 18:56.200]  those are estimate numbers some say as high as half i just say a third
[18:56.200 --> 19:00.200]  it's a low number i go with the low number i know the swine flu killed tens of
[19:00.200 --> 19:04.680]  millions in 1918 i don't know i don't know
[19:04.680 --> 19:08.920]  there's a wash the post hundred thousand cases
[19:09.560 --> 19:12.040]  see they're already saying it could be a hundred thousand
[19:12.040 --> 19:15.480]  20 000 or a hundred thousand that's the headline see
[19:15.480 --> 19:20.680]  we were very conservative but we were first we pointed out the analysis and

[23:58.760 --> 24:14.920]  Alex Jones here back live well he warned everybody that they were
[24:14.920 --> 24:17.880]  going to put armored vehicles on the streets and we're federalizing police
[24:17.880 --> 24:20.280]  and we're going to use homeland security against
[24:20.280 --> 24:24.120]  conservatives libertarians gun owners and veterans it broke here
[24:24.120 --> 24:27.960]  six years ago with the secret documents that i received by the state police in
[24:27.960 --> 24:33.880]  Missouri and a federal marshal from california
[24:33.880 --> 24:37.960]  i can say that now in both cases because one of them is retired
[24:37.960 --> 24:42.760]  and the other state police officer uh did not get in trouble even though they
[24:42.760 --> 24:47.720]  were able to discover that he had sent it in fact he got promoted after getting
[24:47.720 --> 24:50.040]  in trouble that's another thing everybody's so scared of
[24:50.040 --> 24:55.000]  being a whistleblower people end up admiring that
[24:55.000 --> 24:58.280]  that's why we need more people to stand up and tell the truth
[24:58.280 --> 25:02.600]  but now it's mainstream news that homeland security is treasonously
[25:02.600 --> 25:06.600]  pointed at the american people look at this article from yesterday
[25:06.600 --> 25:10.280]  adan Salazar wrote it when i saw this i couldn't believe it and i went and
[25:10.280 --> 25:14.360]  watched the local newscast firefighters ordered to remove
[25:14.360 --> 25:19.640]  american flag stickers days before 9 11 off their private lockers
[25:19.640 --> 25:23.240]  and the fire chief said it would be offensive to other firefighters
[25:23.240 --> 25:26.520]  who weren't americans
[25:26.520 --> 25:30.360]  marywood firefighters were disciplined hues
[25:30.360 --> 25:36.840]  rossack and shirlo surulo and one other were all
[25:36.840 --> 25:43.560]  put on leave unpaid leave sent home because they refused to take the
[25:43.560 --> 25:47.160]  little american flag stickers uh off of their
[25:47.160 --> 25:50.520]  lockers because they had been told they were
[25:50.520 --> 25:55.320]  offensive there's your political correctness ladies and gentlemen
[25:55.320 --> 26:00.200]  you can't have an american flag on your locker
[26:02.600 --> 26:05.000]  but
[26:05.880 --> 26:12.360]  you can demonize the founding fathers and army training manuals
[26:12.360 --> 26:17.640]  it's just bizarro land our government openly is funding al-qaeda calling an
[26:17.640 --> 26:22.120]  ISIS and it's now going to give billions not 500 million
[26:22.120 --> 26:25.800]  to them and congress is about to give the money to obama
[26:25.800 --> 26:28.760]  to then go arm the rebels that are attacking Assad
[26:28.760 --> 26:34.760]  who were made up mainly of the Saudi arabian qatari jihadis
[26:34.760 --> 26:39.640]  and i've had former state department officials on cia operas from the army
[26:39.640 --> 26:45.880]  on kernels generals or they're all on record
[26:45.880 --> 26:50.680]  saying that yes the main force is al qaeda
[26:50.680 --> 26:56.600]  and we we defeat them by arming them that's how stupid they think everyone
[26:56.600 --> 27:01.000]  is and we dare
[27:01.240 --> 27:07.800]  we dared back in early august to beat the drum for a week
[27:07.800 --> 27:13.720]  because i said i want to focus on abola going airborne according to the cdc
[27:13.720 --> 27:16.440]  and the world health organization and that they think it's going to go really
[27:16.440 --> 27:21.160]  airborne because it's it's it's it's airborne somewhat now but it's weak
[27:21.160 --> 27:25.320]  but it's becoming airborne they believe it's becoming airborne
[27:25.320 --> 27:28.840]  and then we get attacked for that that we're fair mongers no we're not
[27:28.840 --> 27:33.320]  we link to the cdc documents we link to the virology reports
[27:33.320 --> 27:37.400]  we link to it we didn't say it
[27:37.400 --> 27:43.960]  it's like when the new york times calls matt drudge a uh tabloid person when he
[27:43.960 --> 27:48.040]  links to the new york times and he links to dur spiegel it just we're just
[27:48.040 --> 27:52.840]  linking to the reports info wars takes them and writes an article around it
[27:52.840 --> 27:56.520]  oh and here's seven reports that it appears abola's going airborne
[27:56.520 --> 28:01.800]  two years ago now it's spreading this top virologist says he thinks it'll kill
[28:01.800 --> 28:09.480]  five million people there's been estimates you can pull them up
[28:09.480 --> 28:14.200]  of three billion dying if abola goes completely airborne
[28:14.200 --> 28:18.760]  meaning you know floating around for hours or days or even weeks
[28:18.760 --> 28:23.560]  you can have anthrax on the ground for 50 years and it gets out
[28:26.040 --> 28:30.760]  i don't know but now the new york times today says
[28:30.760 --> 28:35.320]  what we're afraid to say about abola and then it goes into the fact that's
[28:35.320 --> 28:38.600]  turning into an epidemic a pandemic that nothing's
[28:38.600 --> 28:42.760]  happened like this in decades anywhere in the world
[28:42.760 --> 28:47.000]  and that scientists and doctors believe that it may be beginning to go
[28:47.000 --> 28:51.320]  airborne and it says that right here in the article
[28:53.000 --> 28:57.480]  and drudge has the headline doc warrants of airborne abola
[28:57.480 --> 29:01.720]  so that's what's in the new york times today do i get an apology from any of
[29:01.720 --> 29:06.120]  these publications no of course not here's another headline black market in
[29:06.120 --> 29:10.840]  blood serum emerging amid abola outbreak
[29:13.000 --> 29:17.080]  and then we have the graphs on the spread of it and the british study
[29:17.080 --> 29:21.480]  the one in telegraph millions more at risk for abola outbreak british study
[29:21.480 --> 29:24.840]  finds they have computers tracking the spread so far
[29:24.840 --> 29:27.880]  and it's estimating millions are going to get it basically
[29:27.880 --> 29:33.240]  and when we come back virologist it's too late abola will kill five million
[29:33.240 --> 29:38.120]  experts says virus will infect entire population of african countries
[29:38.120 --> 29:41.880]  paul joseph watson reporting for info wars dot com in that article
[29:41.880 --> 29:45.160]  we're gonna tweet that out again right now we'll come back break it down stay

[33:50.840 --> 33:54.120]  then it's attacked nationwide even though we're linking to the exact same
[33:54.120 --> 33:58.120]  statements another story up on drudge mad science
[33:58.120 --> 34:03.720]  genetically modified micro humans to be framed

[34:08.040 --> 34:10.920]  folks that's already going on where they grow the little embryos but then add
[34:10.920 --> 34:14.760]  some animal DNA to it so they claim it's not a human it doesn't have rights
[34:14.760 --> 34:18.040]  mad science genetically modified micro humans
[34:18.040 --> 34:23.880]  to be farmed for drug testing by 2017 so we're going to look at this article and
[34:23.880 --> 34:29.080]  then go to our guest syrian girl reporting from Australia
[34:29.080 --> 34:31.960]  on her inside scoop she's been joining us for over a year
[34:31.960 --> 34:35.400]  almost really happening in syria and obama's statements
[34:35.400 --> 34:39.000]  but before we go any further and finish up with this article virologist
[34:39.000 --> 34:41.880]  it's too late Ebola will kill five million people
[34:41.880 --> 34:45.480]  experts says virus will infect entire population of african countries
[34:45.480 --> 34:48.280]  and the london telegraph is saying their models
[34:48.280 --> 34:52.520]  british models show millions will be infected a top german virologist has
[34:52.520 --> 34:55.320]  caused shockwaves by asserting that it's too late
[34:55.320 --> 34:59.000]  to halt the spread of Ebola in syria leone and liberia
[34:59.000 --> 35:03.080]  and that five million people will die noting that efforts should now be
[35:03.080 --> 35:06.760]  focused on stopping the transmission of the virus to other countries
[35:06.760 --> 35:13.240]  Jonas Schmidt of the Bernhardt Institute for Tropical Medicine in
[35:13.240 --> 35:15.320]  Hamburg one of the most prestigious in the world
[35:15.320 --> 35:18.840]  told germany's deutch well that's one of their top publications
[35:18.840 --> 35:22.760]  that hope is all but lost for the inhabitants of syria leone well yeah
[35:22.760 --> 35:26.040]  their their their leaders said they're preparing to collapse and that'll kill
[35:26.040 --> 35:29.560]  a lot of people in of itself and liberia and the virus will only
[35:29.560 --> 35:32.920]  burn itself out when it is infected the entire population and killed five
[35:32.920 --> 35:36.600]  million people close quote the right time to get this epidemic
[35:36.600 --> 35:39.320]  under control in these countries has been missed
[35:39.320 --> 35:46.200]  said schmidt the time was in may and june now it's too late
[35:46.200 --> 35:49.960]  i would expect to have the washington post new york times cannot say that we
[35:49.960 --> 35:53.560]  made all this up and we're not linking to the main german publications
[35:53.560 --> 35:58.120]  but this is being said i was hoping it was hype a few months ago i said that
[35:58.120 --> 36:02.040]  on august 4th when paul watson wrote the article about virologist worried it's
[36:02.040 --> 36:05.720]  gone airborne and we said hey we hope this is you know gets
[36:05.720 --> 36:08.920]  contained but it was already 10 times when any previous
[36:08.920 --> 36:12.840]  Ebola outbreak had been something happened folks we went investigated
[36:12.840 --> 36:16.600]  there it was in the medical literature that they believe it was going airborne
[36:16.600 --> 36:20.600]  it's starting to walk it's not it was crawling
[36:20.600 --> 36:27.160]  then walking if it starts running they're saying there's 200 mutations of it now
[36:27.160 --> 36:30.440]  before there was only a few dozen mutations it's going crazy
[36:30.440 --> 36:35.160]  it's been manipulated clearly it may mutate and burn itself out
[36:35.160 --> 36:39.000]  i don't know i'm not a virologist but i do the research
[36:39.000 --> 36:43.720]  we've been proven right yet again what am i doing
[36:43.720 --> 36:48.280]  i'm getting my guts cleaned out taking oxy powder from info wars life dot com
[36:48.280 --> 36:52.600]  i'm taking nasa and iodine x2 to clear out my blood stream
[36:52.600 --> 36:58.760]  i am taking colloidal silver but not just for the Ebola even though they
[36:58.760 --> 37:01.640]  brought Ebola patients now a fourth one to Atlanta
[37:01.640 --> 37:05.640]  i'm doing this because there's a bunch of weird airborne
[37:05.640 --> 37:08.840]  stuff killing people in hospitals all over the country including three members
[37:08.840 --> 37:11.720]  of my family there's all sorts of flesh eating bacteria now
[37:11.720 --> 37:16.200]  this stuff's all coming at once where the mutations and the toxic genetic
[37:16.200 --> 37:19.160]  manipulation all of it is starting to come to a new
[37:19.160 --> 37:22.920]  flashpoint and we see times in history where you won't just get black
[37:22.920 --> 37:27.400]  plague popping up you'll get something else popping up at the same time
[37:27.400 --> 37:30.840]  i got scared this year when my uncle my grand uncle my cousin all died in these
[37:30.840 --> 37:34.360]  texas from the same mystery illness that the hospital doctors told us
[37:34.360 --> 37:38.040]  was scaring them and killing members of the staff and everybody knows around
[37:38.040 --> 37:40.440]  the office i've been doing everything i can
[37:40.440 --> 37:44.360]  from working out more to drinking more water to going to sleep earlier
[37:44.360 --> 37:48.200]  having my kids do it because i'm getting ready for this winter
[37:48.200 --> 37:51.160]  i'm getting ready folks just like in the old times they said you know don't go
[37:51.160 --> 37:53.880]  outside with your shoes off you'll catch your death or whatever
[37:53.880 --> 37:57.160]  all they knew was you went out and got cold it would lower your immune system
[37:57.160 --> 38:00.760]  i mean it's time to really try to get healthy and yes we sell products that
[38:00.760 --> 38:04.040]  aren't silver bullets
[38:04.520 --> 38:08.760]  pun intended with with the silver bullet coil silver we have but
[38:08.760 --> 38:12.600]  are obviously better across the board to boost your immune system
[38:12.600 --> 38:16.200]  and to try to get sunlight try to drink purified water
[38:16.200 --> 38:21.000]  infowarslife.com now we're going to go to syrian girl here in just a moment
[38:21.000 --> 38:25.720]  but before we do that i saw welden hinson
[38:25.720 --> 38:29.000]  and i saw jacari jackson welden hinson runs
[38:29.000 --> 38:32.680]  the shipping department and a lot of the marketing stuff does a great job
[38:32.680 --> 38:35.880]  and of course jacari is one of our great reporters and investigative journalists
[38:35.880 --> 38:39.000]  but they just so happened to both be wearing what i believe is the best
[38:39.000 --> 38:43.400]  second amendment shirt ever made the last one i had the concept for and that
[38:43.400 --> 38:48.360]  kade designed our great graphics guy um was the best to that point in my view
[38:48.360 --> 38:52.280]  a lot of people agree it was our best seller this one is even better
[38:52.280 --> 38:56.520]  you got to go to info or store.com to see it it says molon lobby with an
[38:56.520 --> 38:59.880]  american flag draped downwards in gray
[38:59.880 --> 39:06.360]  with the bronze gold uh 300 spartan helmet with 250 caliber
[39:06.360 --> 39:11.960]  two scale bullets crossed with 1776 and info wars dot com under it with a
[39:11.960 --> 39:17.480]  special forces style gray american flag on the left arm
[39:17.480 --> 39:20.440]  and let's cut to jacari jackson and welden hinson
[39:20.440 --> 39:23.880]  because i just haven't taken one of these home yet in two weeks and washed it
[39:23.880 --> 39:26.920]  and worn it yet or a sports jacket on there but i'm gonna be wearing one of
[39:26.920 --> 39:30.520]  these this i believe is the best second amendment
[39:30.520 --> 39:34.120]  shirt i've ever seen now tastes differ i didn't tell you guys what i was about
[39:34.120 --> 39:35.800]  to do i just said i want people to see the shirts
[39:35.800 --> 39:39.080]  watching on television radio listeners go to info or store.com and they can
[39:39.080 --> 39:42.760]  link through and see it there and see the back of the shirt
[39:42.760 --> 39:45.480]  i don't know if it's your favorite ever i just noticed you're both wearing them
[39:45.480 --> 39:48.680]  today do you what do you think of this shirt jacari
[39:48.680 --> 39:51.800]  i really like the last one but this one i think you like said you stepped it up
[39:51.800 --> 39:54.760]  and not so the the flag in the background definitely helps
[39:54.760 --> 39:57.480]  and you know people get it you know they see the the image the icon
[39:57.480 --> 40:00.600]  the iconography it's a very powerful image a very simple image
[40:00.600 --> 40:03.560]  that people can get and understand and it's a very attractive shirt i was
[40:03.560 --> 40:06.440]  actually wearing this at a restaurant just a few minutes ago and the guy
[40:06.440 --> 40:08.920]  came up to me just started talking to me you know because he recognized the
[40:08.920 --> 40:11.720]  shirt he thought was an interesting shirt and we had a conversation because
[40:11.720 --> 40:15.240]  of this this is also a a conversation piece.
[40:15.240 --> 40:18.760]  It's awesome and we're lucky that a jacari and welden
[40:18.760 --> 40:23.400]  look like calvin kline models so i'm gonna go take some photos for the
[40:23.400 --> 40:26.440]  website to promote it if you guys feel like it because
[40:26.440 --> 40:29.080]  those shirts are awesome i wish i looked that good at them
[40:29.080 --> 40:32.840]  welden give us your take on the shirt here this is again just off the cuff
[40:32.840 --> 40:35.640]  this is how we fund our operation this is for sure going to be the best one we
[40:35.640 --> 40:39.560]  we've ever had we just got this in the store last week we designed it
[40:39.560 --> 40:42.440]  took a little longer than the other ones we knew you liked the 50 cal that's
[40:42.440 --> 40:45.800]  one of your favorite guns alex so we put the 50 cal bullets on it
[40:45.800 --> 40:49.640]  and we're excited to put this one out i think everyone's
[40:49.640 --> 40:53.640]  going to really like it so well by concept i'm like i want american flag on
[40:53.640 --> 40:56.520]  the arm and i want some bullets crossed under it
[40:56.520 --> 41:01.000]  with it looking face forward and then kade really designed it he is so good
[41:01.000 --> 41:04.120]  i think this one really has kind of a special forces feel to it
[41:04.120 --> 41:08.520]  it's going to be great when part of our maiden 1776 product line this is made in
[41:08.520 --> 41:11.720]  america the shirts made in america all the graphics were printed right here in
[41:11.720 --> 41:14.920]  america so support the info war that's another good

[41:53.880 --> 41:56.360]  just really happened because i was over here uh
[41:56.360 --> 41:59.320]  near this radio studio and alex saw me with the shirt i said hey come in here
[41:59.320 --> 42:02.120]  and show off the the new shirt the new hat we got all the gear we have the
[42:02.120 --> 42:06.440]  belt buckles all this at info warshop.com and that's how we fund the
[42:06.440 --> 42:09.400]  info war not taking tax money like rachel madow
[42:09.400 --> 42:12.040]  you know people need to keep checking back we've got a lot more american made
[42:12.040 --> 42:15.560]  products coming in moan lobby hats we got the beanies that just went up of
[42:15.560 --> 42:20.520]  course uh jacaris got we sold out of the moan lobby brass but we didn't fully
[42:20.520 --> 42:24.680]  print the whole number we were we printed 250s out of 500 of the brass one
[42:24.680 --> 42:28.040]  so we have another 250 coming and then they're gone yeah that's what we did
[42:28.040 --> 42:32.120]  those just came in the last 250 of the brass moan lobby buckles
[42:32.120 --> 42:34.840]  uh you know we kind of overwhelm the manufacturer because they do make them
[42:34.840 --> 42:39.160]  handmade here in america veteran owned and they are veteran own yes
[42:39.160 --> 42:42.200]  and um actually people need to you know keep checking back because we got a
[42:42.200 --> 42:45.080]  lot more stuff coming up before the holidays that's right i mean we are
[42:45.080 --> 42:48.760]  just working as hard as we can to have everything made in america we're
[42:48.760 --> 42:51.880]  working and we're not perfect you know the dash cams are made in china but
[42:51.880 --> 42:55.160]  that's why they're so inexpensive and work so well we have the lowest price on
[42:55.160 --> 42:59.480]  the dash cam and it's private label to info wars lowest price you'll find
[42:59.480 --> 43:03.160]  lower than amazon absolutely so there is stuff from china but
[43:03.160 --> 43:06.120]  we're we're we're putting our money where our mouth is we're moving towards
[43:06.120 --> 43:09.960]  american made and i mean a normal american made golf shirt would be 60 to
[43:09.960 --> 43:13.320]  $80 we have it for 40 it costs us like 25 a
[43:13.320 --> 43:15.240]  piece it's absolutely true we could buy the same
[43:15.240 --> 43:18.360]  golf shirt from china for five dollars when we started moving most of our
[43:18.360 --> 43:22.600]  products over to american made we definitely saw price increase uh so
[43:22.600 --> 43:25.400]  we're hoping to change that you know we need to we need to support more american
[43:25.400 --> 43:28.920]  made manufacturers and that'll drive down the price once it moves back here
[43:28.920 --> 43:31.960]  absolutely well it's all the regulations and red tape you can't compete
[43:31.960 --> 43:35.720]  that's right it's done by design so we do have shirts from Mexico and Honduras
[43:35.720 --> 43:38.600]  and stuff that are half the price if you make the choice to get them then you
[43:38.600 --> 43:42.200]  spread the word that way but we do offer american made ones now and
[43:42.200 --> 43:45.080]  more to come absolutely gentlemen thank you so
[43:45.080 --> 43:48.680]  much great job thank you hey real quick jacari and and
[43:48.680 --> 43:51.960]  welden what do you make of like top horologists saying five million will
[43:51.960 --> 43:55.080]  die uh now in Africa i mean this is crazy well you
[43:55.080 --> 43:58.120]  know when we first started talking about this you know months ago you know is
[43:58.120 --> 44:01.560]  all scare tactics fear mongering all this but we were just looking at the
[44:01.560 --> 44:04.600]  tell the tape we were looking at what these top experts were saying
[44:04.600 --> 44:08.200]  the people who study this the people who live this information day in and day out
[44:08.200 --> 44:11.320]  and like you said you know we research it but we talk to the people who you know
[44:11.320 --> 44:14.520]  live it and they say you know this is definitely a concern uh people coming
[44:14.520 --> 44:17.080]  in like you said uh the people going into Atlanta
[44:17.080 --> 44:20.360]  other places as well and people want to find out you know what's going on at
[44:20.360 --> 44:23.080]  least i want to find out what's going on because i don't want to get caught with
[44:23.080 --> 44:26.280]  you know my pants down so to speak we have this big epidemic and now it's
[44:26.280 --> 44:29.080]  like oh oops sorry we started bringing people in you didn't know about it
[44:29.080 --> 44:33.160]  and now it's here i think the key is for everyone to stay informed and and be
[44:33.160 --> 44:36.680]  prepared and you know there's a lot of things you can do we need you know
[44:36.680 --> 44:39.640]  people need to focus on that kind of stuff being prepared and educated on
[44:39.640 --> 44:43.800]  exactly we're not fear mongering we're cutting edge raising the alarm like
[44:43.800 --> 44:47.720]  paul revere yeah absolutely yeah it's like uh
[44:47.720 --> 44:50.280]  when we got to Ferguson like oh you guys are fear mongering the police aren't
[44:50.280 --> 44:53.480]  out there doing this is like police have to put sniper dots on people's chest
[44:53.480 --> 44:56.520]  you know that's not fear mongering that's telling people what's going on you know
[44:56.520 --> 44:59.080]  there's plenty of good police out there but you don't want to see these kind of
[44:59.080 --> 45:02.680]  tactics well then the feds blamed them when they gave them the training
[45:02.680 --> 45:05.320]  oh yeah they gave them they gave them the big tanks they gave them the training
[45:05.320 --> 45:09.400]  the m-rap vehicles the heavy armor that was federal training to put the laser
[45:09.400 --> 45:12.760]  on yeah and then they and then they say oh we gave it to them but we didn't know
[45:12.760 --> 45:15.880]  they were going to do it the sound cannons oh yeah and they said well
[45:15.880 --> 45:18.840]  you're not supposed to use it for a peaceful protester that's like an
[45:18.840 --> 45:21.800]  active shooter situation they give them the stuff knowing how they're going to
[45:21.800 --> 45:25.080]  use it and then when they use like oh shame on you for using it that way they
[45:25.080 --> 45:28.360]  sent them to federal training centers and train them oh yeah it's all
[45:28.360 --> 45:31.320]  standardized the uniform is a federal grant
[45:31.320 --> 45:34.840]  the training is a federal grant all of its federal yeah
[45:34.840 --> 45:38.360]  oh yeah and it's such a joke because we were out there in Ferguson
[45:38.360 --> 45:41.160]  and the the only report I regret we didn't do
[45:41.160 --> 45:44.840]  was to show how close the uh martial law center was
[45:44.840 --> 45:48.200]  to the uh where the things were taking place on uh West Florette uh

[46:22.840 --> 46:27.720]  support now joining us from australia
[46:27.720 --> 46:30.680]  is syrian girl she goes by that her name is now known
[46:30.680 --> 46:35.080]  she's been on national australian uh television
[46:35.080 --> 46:38.040]  uh and syrian girl comes from a former ruling class family
[46:38.040 --> 46:41.720]  that was deposed by the bathis coup and thrown out by Assad's father
[46:41.720 --> 46:45.720]  so and they're and they're also suiting folks but they don't like al qaeda
[46:45.720 --> 46:48.760]  obviously she's a hundred percent syrian to the core and activists and
[46:48.760 --> 46:51.640]  career student uh and her opinion of the syrian
[46:51.640 --> 46:55.560]  government i have no illusion to my in any government around the world
[46:55.560 --> 46:58.920]  and her twitter handle is partisan girl
[46:58.920 --> 47:04.040]  youtube syrian girl partisan youtube.com forward slash syrian girl partisan
[47:04.040 --> 47:06.920]  i want to get her breakdown because she's been on with this for over a year
[47:06.920 --> 47:12.280]  and a half now how time flies since early 2013
[47:12.280 --> 47:15.400]  and everything she said turned out to be incredibly accurate she has sources
[47:15.400 --> 47:18.440]  inside syria obama says no boots in the ground even though
[47:18.440 --> 47:21.720]  there are boots in the ground he says he's going to give
[47:21.720 --> 47:26.360]  billions of dollars uh to the quote rebels to fight the bad rebels when we
[47:26.360 --> 47:29.720]  know the rebels will just fight Assad and the government
[47:29.720 --> 47:34.520]  uh and so i want to get her view on this because it's so bizarre
[47:34.520 --> 47:37.400]  to see them using the public's ignorance about the players
[47:37.400 --> 47:40.440]  to actually launch a new war in syria they couldn't get a year ago
[47:40.440 --> 47:43.880]  because our military said no we're not going to be the air force of al qaeda
[47:43.880 --> 47:47.400]  well a year later changed the name to isis and they claim you've got to stop
[47:47.400 --> 47:53.000]  isis by arming isis syrian girl thank you so much for joining us
[47:53.000 --> 47:56.600]  thanks so much for having me again alex i just want to
[47:56.600 --> 47:59.800]  reiterate what you said you know it's it's not about
[47:59.800 --> 48:03.400]  the syrian government i have no illusions as you said in any government
[48:03.400 --> 48:07.240]  around the world but at a time where your borders are being breached
[48:07.240 --> 48:11.160]  you have nobody to turn to but your army to defend you and that's where i'm
[48:11.160 --> 48:14.920]  coming from with my family my grandfather was
[48:14.920 --> 48:19.080]  deposed from power but we were never really kicked out of the country
[48:19.080 --> 48:22.280]  i just want to i'm sorry to get that wrong i mean i mean you left the country
[48:22.280 --> 48:25.720]  you left the country yes we did but thank you for you know your
[48:25.720 --> 48:29.480]  introduction and i want to like uh talk about
[48:29.480 --> 48:33.640]  obama's recent speech and everything surrounding that
[48:33.640 --> 48:39.400]  you know last time i was here a year ago we were facing the same scenario
[48:39.400 --> 48:42.920]  of syria being possibly attacked only at that time
[48:42.920 --> 48:46.680]  the excuse that was being used was chemical weapons
[48:46.680 --> 48:50.520]  and it seems that the um there's only three
[48:50.520 --> 48:54.280]  sort of options that the u.s government will use as an excuse for war
[48:54.280 --> 48:59.080]  either its regime change wmds or chemical weapons whatever you want to call it
[48:59.080 --> 49:02.680]  or back to the good old faithful fighting terrorism bit
[49:02.680 --> 49:07.000]  and it seems that the fighting terrorism bit is the easiest one to sell
[49:07.000 --> 49:10.280]  um and they think that we have goldfish memories that we haven't
[49:10.280 --> 49:14.360]  noticed that for the last three years they've been supporting al-qaeda in libya
[49:14.360 --> 49:19.240]  and syria and wherever else and the the biggest irony as well
[49:19.240 --> 49:22.440]  is that even though the the groups that they're supporting have been burning
[49:22.440 --> 49:26.680]  and tearing down churches obama recently met with
[49:26.680 --> 49:30.680]  christian minorities syrian minorities and tried to win them over
[49:30.680 --> 49:34.840]  and in that conference he actually admitted the asset has been protecting
[49:34.840 --> 49:38.440]  christians for the last few years so
[49:38.440 --> 49:43.320]  it's it's quite funny but most of the government officials that attended that
[49:43.320 --> 49:47.640]  conference got booed off the stage by the syrian christians who asked
[49:47.640 --> 49:51.240]  obama in that case then why have you been supporting these so-called
[49:51.240 --> 49:55.240]  you know moderate rebels um last year when i was
[49:55.240 --> 49:58.600]  here on your show i said that the chemical weapons
[49:58.600 --> 50:02.200]  were a deterrent and now that they're gone
[50:02.200 --> 50:05.640]  would leave us open for an attack and i also said
[50:05.640 --> 50:09.960]  that the u.s government wouldn't attack syria until they were gone
[50:09.960 --> 50:14.920]  and i think that that proved to be true i also
[50:14.920 --> 50:20.440]  said that the syrian air defenses were quite strong and that would prevent a
[50:20.440 --> 50:24.760]  u.s airstrike and of course at the time dempsi was saying that
[50:24.760 --> 50:29.000]  we can't have air strikes against syria we can only have kinetic strikes which
[50:29.000 --> 50:33.000]  means launching missiles from boats and it seems now
[50:33.000 --> 50:39.400]  that the isis terrorists have been taking out syrian air defenses
[50:39.400 --> 50:43.320]  in the northeast of the country in takba airbase
[50:43.320 --> 50:47.240]  and i tweeted out days before takba airbase fell to isis
[50:47.240 --> 50:51.480]  that as soon as the airbase falls and that means that syria's air defenses
[50:51.480 --> 50:54.040]  fall with it then we're going to start hearing about
[50:54.040 --> 50:58.600]  the u.s uh government and obama saying he wants to attack syria and that is
[50:58.600 --> 51:02.920]  exactly what's happened you know i run like interestingly around the same
[51:02.920 --> 51:06.360]  time was when the two american journalists were beheaded
[51:06.360 --> 51:10.040]  and obama is basically using the fact that isis
[51:10.040 --> 51:13.960]  killed these two journalists to whip up support for war and to
[51:13.960 --> 51:18.200]  you know get people really angry um but interestingly the family
[51:18.200 --> 51:21.880]  of these uh of soclov one of the journalists that was killed
[51:21.880 --> 51:25.240]  said that the moderate rebels that obama is trying to help
[51:25.240 --> 51:29.880]  actually sold foley to isis
[51:29.880 --> 51:34.680]  it's uh a real shock um it is and i had colonel schaefer on
[51:34.680 --> 51:38.040]  who was at capitol hill that day just a few days ago
[51:38.040 --> 51:41.480]  and he said look it's way over 65 percent of the rebels
[51:41.480 --> 51:45.160]  that are really al-qaeda and of course we're not demonizing
[51:45.160 --> 51:49.320]  sunnis here that are 79 of islam you yourself are our
[51:49.320 --> 51:54.360]  our sunni uh it's it's that this Saudi arabian back group
[51:54.360 --> 51:58.200]  literally is there to to deindustrialize and shut down any country
[51:58.200 --> 52:01.320]  and when i said you got your family got kicked out of the country i meant that
[52:01.320 --> 52:06.120]  as a paraphrase of saying you aren't allies with Assad
[52:06.120 --> 52:09.000]  when you are defending the regime and the army
[52:09.000 --> 52:13.000]  because uh i mean that just adds to your credibility
[52:13.000 --> 52:17.160]  um and it shows how accurate you've been the last few years
[52:17.160 --> 52:23.080]  speaking out well i have no personal gain and my family has no personal gain
[52:23.080 --> 52:26.440]  in this position it's just uh frankly just
[52:26.440 --> 52:29.720]  observing the truth and observing the news for for
[52:29.720 --> 52:33.720]  not just the last three years but the last few decades and even
[52:33.720 --> 52:37.880]  before september 11 so it's all part of the
[52:37.880 --> 52:41.000]  the wider plot of everything and of course i was
[52:41.000 --> 52:44.440]  also an avid watcher of your show i'd like to say that
[52:44.440 --> 52:48.840]  and when i was a teenager um so that helped me wake up to
[52:48.840 --> 52:52.600]  everything i was going on in the world and really opened my eyes to all the
[52:52.600 --> 52:57.160]  agendas um and really i i guess i would like to
[52:57.160 --> 53:01.080]  just go back to um the story of the two journalists who were beheaded
[53:01.080 --> 53:05.720]  yes and the media's reaction um to it which i thought was really jarring
[53:05.720 --> 53:09.720]  because um so many syrians have been beheaded by these
[53:09.720 --> 53:13.480]  al-qaeda groups for the last three years and syrian soldiers as well
[53:13.480 --> 53:17.560]  um the media's reaction to these two men being beheaded was
[53:17.560 --> 53:23.240]  outrage but um when time magazine and and they asked people not to watch it
[53:23.240 --> 53:28.200]  they censored images of sort of to get people's imagination going but
[53:28.200 --> 53:33.000]  then if you look at last year time magazine gave an award
[53:33.000 --> 53:37.880]  for journalists photographs and videotape of a syrian soldier being beheaded
[53:37.880 --> 53:41.000]  and that was one of like time magazine's top 10
[53:41.000 --> 53:45.320]  images so that's the kind of treatment that you get as a syrian you know we're
[53:45.320 --> 53:49.320]  seen as subhuman sheep to the slaughter and it's just a great story to what
[53:49.320 --> 53:52.760]  just get beheaded but nothing to be outraged about
[53:52.760 --> 53:57.800]  um i don't think the u.s like with the history of what's happening
[53:57.800 --> 54:00.680]  i don't think anybody should take seriously the idea that they really
[54:00.680 --> 54:04.120]  wanted to want to fight isis i think it's an excuse
[54:04.120 --> 54:07.880]  to intervene in syria to keep the chaos going and to eventually
[54:07.880 --> 54:12.600]  balcony syria into different pieces you know if they really really wanted to
[54:12.600 --> 54:15.720]  fight isis then they would stop their ally and
[54:15.720 --> 54:19.560]  NATO member turkey from giving isis refuge
[54:19.560 --> 54:23.400]  on the syrian-turkish border they not only give them refuge they give them
[54:23.400 --> 54:26.680]  medical treatment and they allow them through the border
[54:26.680 --> 54:29.720]  no turkey actually came out and said i'm not going to take part
[54:29.720 --> 54:33.400]  in allowing my airways to be used against isis and that's because there's so
[54:33.400 --> 54:37.640]  many isis individuals inside turkey now that turkey's afraid that they're
[54:37.640 --> 54:41.400]  going to start causing problems and of course turkey has an agenda to support
[54:41.400 --> 54:44.600]  isis um
[54:44.600 --> 54:47.560]  the turkish government war room leaks actually
[54:47.560 --> 54:50.440]  have the turkish government officials on record
[54:50.440 --> 54:53.960]  saying they would like to use isis in a false flag operation to start a war with
[54:53.960 --> 54:58.280]  syria that was last year so again you know one of the
[54:58.280 --> 55:02.920]  u.s's allies in the region israel has been giving medical aid
[55:02.920 --> 55:07.240]  to the fsa and jabhat al-nusra on the syrian-golan heights border
[55:07.240 --> 55:10.120]  and actually netanyahu went and visited them
[55:10.120 --> 55:14.520]  and these jabhat al-nusra rebels actually kidnapped
[55:14.520 --> 55:19.240]  u.n peacekeepers recently on the israeli border the filipino ones
[55:19.240 --> 55:22.760]  where was the international condemnation for that and interestingly
[55:22.760 --> 55:27.880]  qatar another u.s ally has influenced enough with jabhat al-nusra
[55:27.880 --> 55:31.560]  to actually get these u.n officials out so
[55:31.560 --> 55:34.600]  the fact is we haven't really heard about jabhat al-nusra anymore which was one
[55:34.600 --> 55:37.240]  of the other groups that the u.s said were terrorists
[55:37.240 --> 55:42.680]  and the interesting part about that is the fact that the fsa who we are
[55:42.680 --> 55:45.480]  calling the moderate rebels came out and said you know
[55:45.480 --> 55:49.880]  we have no problem with jabhat al-nusra we are
[55:49.880 --> 55:53.080]  still fighting alongside them and they're not you know
[55:53.080 --> 55:56.040]  it's fine so that's why you don't really hear about it anymore because now
[55:56.040 --> 55:59.560]  there's some kind of a little bit of friction between fsa and isis
[55:59.560 --> 56:03.800]  however the fsa is still working with alongside isis
[56:03.800 --> 56:07.800]  in arsal on the lebanese border you wouldn't hear that but i would suggest
[56:07.800 --> 56:11.400]  anybody check out uh poll joseph what's an article
[56:11.400 --> 56:15.400]  which i was you know partly a source for describing example
[56:15.400 --> 56:19.320]  about how the moderate rebels are working with isis and are still working
[56:19.320 --> 56:23.160]  with them and how some of the fsa battalions that moderate rebels
[56:23.160 --> 56:27.240]  have defected to isis have sold weapons to isis and of course
[56:27.240 --> 56:32.600]  have sold american journalists to isis so if they really really wanted to fight
[56:32.600 --> 56:35.800]  isis they wouldn't be helping these group of people
[56:35.800 --> 56:38.760]  that have been defecting and selling weapons to isis
[56:38.760 --> 56:42.040]  and they wouldn't be trying to undermine the syrian army
[56:42.040 --> 56:46.280]  who are the only force capable of fighting isis in the entire region
[56:46.280 --> 56:50.440]  you're right of course the rocky army was dismantled and if you just joined us
[56:50.440 --> 56:54.360]  syrian girl is joining us from australia there's a little bit of a delay
[56:54.360 --> 57:00.120]  and that's exactly what colonel shaffer said who was in congress two days ago
[57:00.120 --> 57:04.280]  when he joined us briefing members of congress saying you should join with
[57:04.280 --> 57:10.280]  Assad and the army and offer to clear out isis if you
[57:10.280 --> 57:15.400]  really want to get rid of him he said arming any of the rebels arms al qaeda
[57:15.400 --> 57:19.080]  they're basically all al qaeda they've just changed the name to confuse the
[57:19.080 --> 57:22.600]  public i don't see how the establishment is
[57:22.600 --> 57:25.560]  going to get away with this one way or another and
[57:25.560 --> 57:29.960]  what will the army do what will the Assad regime do
[57:29.960 --> 57:33.800]  when u.s aircraft or nato aircraft start bombing
[57:33.800 --> 57:37.960]  how will they sell bombing Assad forces or the Assad forces
[57:37.960 --> 57:42.520]  fire on the coalition aircraft because they're there giving air cover and
[57:42.520 --> 57:47.240]  arming the rebels that are clearly going to be attacking the government
[57:47.240 --> 57:53.160]  you're that's an excellent question no um first of all like any patriot would
[57:53.160 --> 57:57.960]  we could we all reject any breach of syrian sovereignty no matter what
[57:57.960 --> 58:02.520]  excuse whether it be fighting isis or you know fighting
[58:02.520 --> 58:08.840]  purple dragons but um syria uh is going to take any airstrike against us
[58:08.840 --> 58:12.600]  without permission as an aggression of this stated that
[58:12.600 --> 58:17.240]  openly the um syria has been telling the un about the terror threat
[58:17.240 --> 58:21.080]  for the last three years and they actually agreed to the resolution against
[58:21.080 --> 58:23.320]  isis and they said they were ready to work
[58:23.320 --> 58:26.520]  with any nation who legitimately wants to fight isis
[58:26.520 --> 58:29.960]  so long as they respect syrian sovereignty and coordinate
[58:29.960 --> 58:32.920]  with syria that's right and obama's saying he won't do that
[58:32.920 --> 58:35.960]  this is incredible we'll be back in one minute with the second hour
[58:35.960 --> 58:41.320]  the scottish john joins us in studio thank you for listening to gcf
[58:41.320 --> 58:45.160]  info wars dot com has the article gcn live
[58:45.160 --> 58:49.320]  mainstream german news it's too late a ball will kill five million
[58:49.320 --> 58:52.520]  you've heard about the essential qualities of iodine when it comes to
[58:52.520 --> 58:55.960]  your well-being and you've read the opinions of top experts regarding

[1:00:41.320 --> 1:00:45.240]  the info a lot of these citizen activists you know are better known by
[1:00:45.240 --> 1:00:49.560]  their original internet handles and he's scottish and will give us his breakdown
[1:00:49.560 --> 1:00:53.880]  onto the scottish independent movement that is causing people in catalonia
[1:00:53.880 --> 1:00:57.240]  spain to want to break away it's causing people in texas to talk about it
[1:00:57.240 --> 1:01:00.840]  the new york times an article about that yesterday saying that it's encouraging
[1:01:00.840 --> 1:01:04.840]  this movement all over the world i think scotland should be able to be separate
[1:01:04.840 --> 1:01:07.960]  from the uk but there's some pitfalls to it as well
[1:01:07.960 --> 1:01:11.880]  that vote's coming up next thursday we'll break that down
[1:01:11.880 --> 1:01:18.840]  going back to our guest known as syrian girl continuing with with where you see
[1:01:18.840 --> 1:01:22.680]  all this going i mean what do you expect to unfold now
[1:01:22.680 --> 1:01:26.120]  that we're going to stop the rebels by arming them but they're the good rebels
[1:01:26.120 --> 1:01:30.040]  are not al-qaeda and our own military knows that's not true
[1:01:30.040 --> 1:01:33.720]  our own military generals and kernels and others that i've talked to on and off
[1:01:33.720 --> 1:01:37.960]  record are very upset about this it's all about a pipeline
[1:01:37.960 --> 1:01:42.040]  that's going to run up through syria with natural gas and cut off russia
[1:01:42.040 --> 1:01:46.520]  okay great but america won't even make money off that plus it's immoral
[1:01:46.520 --> 1:01:50.520]  it's blocking free market stuff if they want to have a pipeline pay
[1:01:50.520 --> 1:01:54.200]  Assad pay the government pay the people for using it
[1:01:54.200 --> 1:01:57.800]  i mean you just can't send al-qaeda in to blow up all the churches
[1:01:57.800 --> 1:02:02.520]  because they'll let you have a pipeline it's so immoral
[1:02:02.520 --> 1:02:05.880]  well absolutely about the pipeline i mean that that's going to be the region
[1:02:05.880 --> 1:02:09.240]  that runs right through the isis controlled areas right now and the
[1:02:09.240 --> 1:02:12.680]  idea is just to keep that area destabilized and definitely and cut up
[1:02:12.680 --> 1:02:16.200]  syria into lots of different pieces so that you can never have like a viable
[1:02:16.200 --> 1:02:21.240]  state there that you can with stability that you can run a pipeline through
[1:02:21.240 --> 1:02:24.360]  you know the syrian firm said that isis doesn't need any more airstrikes the
[1:02:24.360 --> 1:02:28.360]  syrian air force can take care of that but what we really need is for the
[1:02:28.360 --> 1:02:32.280]  money flow and the training to stop and what this
[1:02:32.280 --> 1:02:36.440]  obama's mission now it's just going to strengthen isis and
[1:02:36.440 --> 1:02:40.840]  make it sort of a continuous thing you know
[1:02:40.840 --> 1:02:44.360]  and it's very dangerous as well because the russians and the chinese have come
[1:02:44.360 --> 1:02:47.800]  out and said you can't do this without a un resolution this is a breach of
[1:02:47.800 --> 1:02:52.520]  sovereignty and things might escalate if a syrian
[1:02:52.520 --> 1:02:57.800]  air force shoots down an american plane or the american plane shoots some
[1:02:57.800 --> 1:03:02.200]  syrian army as well you know this could actually escalate as it did last year
[1:03:02.200 --> 1:03:06.920]  with with some kind of a world war three scenario where iran and israel and
[1:03:06.920 --> 1:03:11.320]  and russia gets involved um you know people don't want that we don't want
[1:03:11.320 --> 1:03:15.400]  that you know we've already suffered enough war we wanted to see things over
[1:03:15.400 --> 1:03:19.160]  you know we want to protect our sovereignty and our borders
[1:03:19.160 --> 1:03:23.000]  and i i did want to mention as well just
[1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:27.880]  totally changing the subject a little bit but on my channel the
[1:03:27.880 --> 1:03:32.040]  conversations of the journalists that was beheaded
[1:03:32.040 --> 1:03:35.400]  sulklov in the leaked syrian electronic army
[1:03:35.400 --> 1:03:41.480]  emails reveal that uh one of the the uh insurgent the american insurgent
[1:03:41.480 --> 1:03:45.880]  matthew van dyke who went to fight in libya actually told him that he had
[1:03:45.880 --> 1:03:50.440]  information that the syrian rebels actually had chemical weapons and used
[1:03:50.440 --> 1:03:53.960]  them in a lepo and sulklov was interested in writing a story
[1:03:53.960 --> 1:03:58.360]  about this before he was kidnapped you'd find details about that on my channel
[1:03:58.360 --> 1:04:02.920]  but just goes to show you that um you know any any excuse would
[1:04:02.920 --> 1:04:06.760]  would do and the the u.s. just wants a war and
[1:04:06.760 --> 1:04:10.680]  this instability in that region no matter which side they're on and
[1:04:10.680 --> 1:04:14.200]  no matter who they're bombing it doesn't matter if they're not on any side
[1:04:14.200 --> 1:04:17.720]  just so long as they're they're in there selling weapons
[1:04:17.720 --> 1:04:21.720]  and you know creating the chaos me me allah him thank you so much for spending

[1:08:09.800 --> 1:08:23.960]  and the gcn radio network
[1:08:25.000 --> 1:08:29.320]  i'm looking at this headline and it really upsets me
[1:08:29.320 --> 1:08:34.200]  because i remember reading about this in the bbc
[1:08:34.200 --> 1:08:38.680]  when i was first on radio in 1996
[1:08:38.760 --> 1:08:42.840]  and i would go on air and and read the bbc news articles and people wouldn't
[1:08:42.840 --> 1:08:45.960]  believe me because back then nobody was reading uk news
[1:08:45.960 --> 1:08:48.920]  and i'm not saying it's wonderful or perfect but it would have more
[1:08:48.920 --> 1:08:52.520]  interesting things in it about how they were already growing little human
[1:08:52.520 --> 1:08:57.000]  embryos but mixing them with cow dna so they didn't have any
[1:08:57.000 --> 1:09:00.920]  rights because there were laws in the uk and the us
[1:09:00.920 --> 1:09:04.520]  and a lot of other countries china basically has none it's the leader in
[1:09:04.520 --> 1:09:07.160]  all this hong kong makes it glow in the dark
[1:09:07.160 --> 1:09:10.600]  cats you could buy 20 years ago i would cover things like that and people
[1:09:10.600 --> 1:09:14.280]  wouldn't believe it or goats that are part spider that create body armor
[1:09:14.280 --> 1:09:17.000]  people still don't believe that that's probably been in the news
[1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:23.000]  let's not exaggerate 10 000 times but this story we're going to cover later
[1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:26.440]  mad science genetically modified micro humans
[1:09:26.440 --> 1:09:33.080]  to be farmed for drug testing by 2017 so within just four years
[1:09:33.080 --> 1:09:36.840]  three years now wow it's going to go into full production
[1:09:36.840 --> 1:09:39.800]  and you know this is already going on to where they just grow these little
[1:09:39.800 --> 1:09:43.720]  humans and then use their
[1:09:44.200 --> 1:09:48.600]  different stem cells you name it or take the little organs out and they grow
[1:09:48.600 --> 1:09:52.520]  them larger this is the end of humanity this is having no value
[1:09:52.520 --> 1:09:56.360]  on the human species not to mention all the things it's going to give rise to
[1:09:56.360 --> 1:09:59.720]  and i remember in the bbc they had scientists in
[1:09:59.720 --> 1:10:03.800]  1996 talking about how they'd already successfully grown human embryos
[1:10:03.800 --> 1:10:07.400]  inside cow uteruses and they were doing it inside the cow
[1:10:07.400 --> 1:10:11.080]  uteruses and had the uteruses alive outside of cows
[1:10:11.080 --> 1:10:15.720]  trying to figure out how to create artificial wombs well they've done it
[1:10:15.720 --> 1:10:22.200]  and our article links to the patents and links to the announcements by the
[1:10:22.200 --> 1:10:25.400]  companies and our story is up on drudge report
[1:10:25.400 --> 1:10:30.680]  hey alex not to not to be sensational but micro humans is codeword for babies
[1:10:30.680 --> 1:10:34.920]  micro humans is codeword for babies you're right
[1:10:34.920 --> 1:10:38.360]  it is codeword in fact that was the thing back at the time is they were
[1:10:38.360 --> 1:10:41.960]  going to grow embryos which is code for baby
[1:10:41.960 --> 1:10:45.320]  and it's all part of this dehumanization once you have thanks for
[1:10:45.320 --> 1:10:48.920]  pointing that out once you've dehumanized it had
[1:10:48.920 --> 1:10:54.360]  54 million abortions since roe v wade uh once you have death panels for old
[1:10:54.360 --> 1:10:58.600]  people and oh yeah the veterans are on death panels too with the v a
[1:10:58.600 --> 1:11:04.440]  then it's oh micro humans and and yes indeed it is babies
[1:11:04.440 --> 1:11:09.160]  it is little people and they just spin it to their little though
[1:11:09.160 --> 1:11:12.040]  it's kind of like we're putting up microphones in every major city to
[1:11:12.040 --> 1:11:15.960]  listen to your conversations but they can also hear gunshots so they're gunshot
[1:11:15.960 --> 1:11:21.240]  detectors it's all spin developers of artificial
[1:11:21.240 --> 1:11:25.880]  micro humans or mini gm humans close quote in the patent
[1:11:25.880 --> 1:11:29.480]  are hoping to release their technology on the market by 2017
[1:11:29.480 --> 1:11:33.240]  no this isn't a sci-fi joke scientists are developing artificial humans in the
[1:11:33.240 --> 1:11:36.360]  same vein as gm plants with the hope that these
[1:11:36.360 --> 1:11:40.200]  creations will replace the need for using animals in laboratory testing see
[1:11:40.200 --> 1:11:46.360]  oh so that and of course pita and others support this
[1:11:46.360 --> 1:11:52.280]  see how that works oh we don't do animal testing we just do human testing
[1:11:52.280 --> 1:11:56.360]  artificial humans will be farmed close quote this is them saying
[1:11:56.360 --> 1:11:58.600]  with
[1:11:59.320 --> 1:12:03.560]  intersecting organs that can be used in drug test speed up the process of fd
[1:12:03.560 --> 1:12:07.480]  and other government regulatory approvals and supposedly without damaging
[1:12:07.480 --> 1:12:12.200]  rats or other animals currently using laboratories the gm humans will contain
[1:12:12.200 --> 1:12:17.000]  smartphone size microchips that will be programmed to replace up to 10
[1:12:17.000 --> 1:12:22.040]  major human organs this is just this particular company
[1:12:22.040 --> 1:12:27.880]  this is really very old uh technology and the article then links through uh to
[1:12:27.880 --> 1:12:30.920]  all of the announcements by the companies themselves
[1:12:30.920 --> 1:12:35.400]  and uh this report by christina sarich is
[1:12:35.400 --> 1:12:39.720]  up on info wars dot com a great job getting that story out it's also originally
[1:12:39.720 --> 1:12:44.440]  appeared in natural society this yardage website
[1:12:44.440 --> 1:12:50.520]  so there you have it my friends this is how long this has been going on but when
[1:12:50.520 --> 1:12:54.120]  i first read the articles about it the patents about it in the mid 90s and
[1:12:54.120 --> 1:12:58.120]  late 90s it was always but don't worry we've changed their genetic
[1:12:58.120 --> 1:13:02.840]  code one percent so it's not a human so it's not under the law
[1:13:02.840 --> 1:13:07.720]  now this is what we know is going on just like three years ago we told you big
[1:13:07.720 --> 1:13:10.040]  companies were coming out big pharma to make
[1:13:10.040 --> 1:13:16.120]  you have microchips tiny microchips inside all of the prescription drugs
[1:13:16.120 --> 1:13:19.720]  that you then swallow that they then track you with well don't worry
[1:13:19.720 --> 1:13:23.160]  now all the big manufacturers are coming out with this
[1:13:23.160 --> 1:13:26.760]  fizer merc you name it and it's all over the news
[1:13:26.760 --> 1:13:29.640]  three years ago when we reported it one of the big companies sent us a letter and
[1:13:29.640 --> 1:13:33.640]  said we're going to sue you if you say it's an edible
[1:13:33.640 --> 1:13:38.520]  microchip and they said we want you to use a different term
[1:13:38.520 --> 1:13:41.880]  or and i said go ahead and sue me and they backed off but they didn't want
[1:13:41.880 --> 1:13:45.080]  an early backlash they wanted to have their rollout for it
[1:13:45.080 --> 1:13:50.920]  so everyone accepted it so don't call it babies are to be farmed
[1:13:50.920 --> 1:13:55.560]  to be medically tested on because the headline should be
[1:13:55.560 --> 1:14:01.960]  babies to be farmed for medical testing babies to be grown in labs to be
[1:14:01.960 --> 1:14:06.360]  tortured to death oh but all the beautiful
[1:14:06.360 --> 1:14:10.200]  Hollywood stars they all want the stem cells and the rest of them for themselves
[1:14:10.200 --> 1:14:15.240]  i guess they're not speaking out just don't test on a bunny rabbit or a rat
[1:14:15.240 --> 1:14:18.360]  by the way i don't like animal testing i try to buy stuff that hadn't been tested
[1:14:18.360 --> 1:14:22.680]  on animals but when you talk about just oh
[1:14:22.680 --> 1:14:27.960]  little little micro little little and it's the equivalent of basically selling
[1:14:27.960 --> 1:14:31.320]  them for meat at the butcher that's what we've been
[1:14:31.320 --> 1:14:35.240]  brought down to does anybody feel safe when the little ones aren't safe
[1:14:35.240 --> 1:14:38.920]  does anybody think this won't all come back on us does anybody not think we're
[1:14:38.920 --> 1:14:42.360]  living in a science fiction movie where we buy all these apple goods and they
[1:14:42.360 --> 1:14:47.160]  have suicide nets around the buildings forced abortions 18 hour work days
[1:14:47.160 --> 1:14:50.680]  where they literally have blood on the components because they work their
[1:14:50.680 --> 1:14:53.800]  fingers to the bone
[1:14:53.880 --> 1:14:57.000]  and there's been studies out we've covered it where apple could pay
[1:14:57.000 --> 1:15:01.560]  two dollars more per iphone or other device and the people
[1:15:01.560 --> 1:15:05.080]  would be living like kings but they don't want to create a real economy for
[1:15:05.080 --> 1:15:09.160]  humans they're just using humans while foxcom
[1:15:09.160 --> 1:15:14.040]  prepares to replace all 15 million of their workers by 2016 with robots and
[1:15:14.040 --> 1:15:16.840]  they announced that two years ago just a month ago
[1:15:16.840 --> 1:15:20.520]  they had one of their factories go total robot no humans robots work on
[1:15:20.520 --> 1:15:25.080]  robots work on robots oh there's no cps there
[1:15:25.080 --> 1:15:29.320]  the they chain their kids up if they have kids on power poles or light poles
[1:15:29.320 --> 1:15:33.000]  outside and they defecate on the ground and then they wait
[1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:36.680]  till dad or mom comes back with enough food to eat once
[1:15:36.680 --> 1:15:41.480]  and live in shipping containers and we're going to compete with that
[1:15:41.480 --> 1:15:45.240]  we need to pay chinese workers more money
[1:15:45.240 --> 1:15:47.560]  you go away i thought you're against the minimum wage that's not what we're
[1:15:47.560 --> 1:15:51.800]  talking about they artificially create a wage so low the kids
[1:15:51.800 --> 1:15:55.160]  are by the way you think i'm joking type in chinese children
[1:15:55.160 --> 1:15:58.840]  chained up to to light poles and you'll just see shots of little kids lying
[1:15:58.840 --> 1:16:03.080]  the streets outside the factories chained three-year-olds
[1:16:03.080 --> 1:16:06.920]  urinating on the ground that's what you're competing against
[1:16:06.920 --> 1:16:12.680]  that's nafta that's gat that's the new world order ladies and gentlemen
[1:16:12.680 --> 1:16:16.360]  oh but here they can put regulations in where your kids playing in the park when
[1:16:16.360 --> 1:16:20.120]  they're 11 we're going to take them see how that works
[1:16:20.120 --> 1:16:24.600]  now for the rest of the hour shifting gears to something that could be a
[1:16:24.600 --> 1:16:27.400]  solution to the new world order i want to try to explain something that's very
[1:16:27.400 --> 1:16:31.560]  complex and as simplistic as the form as i can
[1:16:31.560 --> 1:16:36.200]  the globalists want to create three mega regions with 10 subregions
[1:16:36.200 --> 1:16:40.280]  destroy the original sovereignty of each country and replace it with a regional
[1:16:40.280 --> 1:16:43.800]  government that then only deals with sub districts within the
[1:16:43.800 --> 1:16:48.600]  original area so i want cultural racial religious
[1:16:48.600 --> 1:16:51.320]  or historical states not because they're they're
[1:16:51.320 --> 1:16:54.680]  perfect but because next to the globalist synthetic
[1:16:54.680 --> 1:17:00.440]  new world order blob it's a firewall or a doubt i would love to see texas at this
[1:17:00.440 --> 1:17:03.400]  point secede from the union and form its own republic
[1:17:03.400 --> 1:17:07.000]  and control our own borders we would be wealthy beyond our wildest dreams
[1:17:07.000 --> 1:17:09.720]  america's already gone it's already been taken over by the globalist
[1:17:09.720 --> 1:17:13.560]  we could re-establish the republic here in texas and then
[1:17:13.560 --> 1:17:16.920]  set up a new state federation with other states as it went
[1:17:16.920 --> 1:17:19.560]  i'm sorry america's already captured by the globalist and we could get the
[1:17:19.560 --> 1:17:22.520]  republic back i would want to do it but at this point i'm all for texas's
[1:17:22.520 --> 1:17:25.720]  secession that's why the feds ran underground kooky
[1:17:25.720 --> 1:17:29.640]  groups early on to make the idea look bad so no one would accept it
[1:17:29.640 --> 1:17:33.000]  now it's more popular than ever major polls show a majority of texas want us
[1:17:33.000 --> 1:17:35.880]  to see it right now scotland's actually doing it
[1:17:35.880 --> 1:17:40.280]  and is set to vote next week the queen has said don't you dare do it and freaked
[1:17:40.280 --> 1:17:43.800]  out about it uh the prime minister oh my gosh
[1:17:43.800 --> 1:17:48.680]  look i'm i've got scottish british you name it german background i don't have a
[1:17:48.680 --> 1:17:52.440]  dog in the fight i would be for uh welsh independence i would
[1:17:52.440 --> 1:17:55.880]  be for irish independence from the e u and the globalist
[1:17:55.880 --> 1:17:59.080]  i am for people being independent and when you've got something based on a
[1:17:59.080 --> 1:18:02.520]  culture and a history that is far better having the people
[1:18:02.520 --> 1:18:06.520]  control their oil and natural gas and and and and state
[1:18:06.520 --> 1:18:10.600]  properties of the people than the globalist and the transylvanian king and
[1:18:10.600 --> 1:18:13.560]  queen they literally are transylvanian nothing against romanians just
[1:18:13.560 --> 1:18:17.480]  they're not even german and so scottish john joins us we're
[1:18:17.480 --> 1:18:21.160]  going to go to break and come back with him and of course boy born to an irish
[1:18:21.160 --> 1:18:23.240]  mother and scottish father i won't read his whole
[1:18:23.240 --> 1:18:27.720]  bio growing up in scotland and then in ireland he then traveled the world and
[1:18:27.720 --> 1:18:31.480]  worked in manufacturing and in industry then he became an actor
[1:18:31.480 --> 1:18:35.960]  coming to texas moving back to london he's been all over the place
[1:18:35.960 --> 1:18:39.080]  uh but but working in the philippines he met a lot of texas that's why he moved
[1:18:39.080 --> 1:18:43.320]  here and i've just kind of boiled that down we're going to break in a moment
[1:18:43.320 --> 1:18:46.200]  but it's got to be over a decade i've run into you
[1:18:46.200 --> 1:18:49.480]  out of second amendment demonstrations property rights demonstrations
[1:18:49.480 --> 1:18:54.360]  scottish john and so now you're here uh you got a promo that runs with us
[1:18:54.360 --> 1:18:58.200]  talking about standing up against the new world order uh and
[1:18:58.200 --> 1:19:02.280]  how long have you been in austin i've been in austin 16 years alex
[1:19:02.280 --> 1:19:05.240]  and i first met you when you were showing your movie
[1:19:05.240 --> 1:19:09.000]  nine eleven wrote the tyranny so 12 years ago there you go
[1:19:09.000 --> 1:19:12.280]  yeah i just finished working for mike hanson at the time
[1:19:12.280 --> 1:19:15.960]  and we met in the alamo draught house that night down on there did we have a
[1:19:15.960 --> 1:19:20.120]  pint no we didn't it's like if we'd gone for a
[1:19:20.120 --> 1:19:24.680]  pint we'd probably still have been sitting there baby and then yakking
[1:19:24.680 --> 1:19:27.720]  oh man well anyways you're hearing me get all wound up and rant through all
[1:19:27.720 --> 1:19:30.840]  this news no i'm always exhausted after the show but that's what i did when we
[1:19:30.840 --> 1:19:33.160]  come back i'm gonna try to give you the floor
[1:19:33.160 --> 1:19:37.640]  to break down some of the basics of scotland what independence means
[1:19:37.640 --> 1:19:40.200]  they've now got big banks trying to pull their money out and stuff
[1:19:40.200 --> 1:19:44.600]  they try to do that to uh iceland as well but the vikings stood their ground
[1:19:44.600 --> 1:19:48.760]  and so i do support independence but the scots have got to watch out
[1:19:48.760 --> 1:19:51.400]  because the globalist will come back in other ways
[1:19:51.400 --> 1:19:54.840]  absolutely and and but but this is the way to go
[1:19:54.840 --> 1:19:58.200]  this is the way to get out of the new world order is a seed from it we'll be
[1:19:58.200 --> 1:20:02.040]  right back virtually anyone can hack your cell phone

[1:23:03.240 --> 1:23:05.800]  pretty bad I tried one world way and found it to be
[1:23:05.800 --> 1:23:09.320]  delicious after 10 weeks on one world way my wife commented
[1:23:09.320 --> 1:23:12.680]  you have more muscles in your leaner than when you were 20 years old

[1:23:17.160 --> 1:23:20.200]  and take two days off after being on one world way
[1:23:20.200 --> 1:23:23.320]  I rode 10 days in a row in over 100 degree heat
[1:23:23.320 --> 1:23:26.760]  and then I take another two servings of one world way and then work out at the
[1:23:26.760 --> 1:23:30.680]  gym for another hour and a half I just couldn't believe these results
[1:23:30.680 --> 1:23:34.520]  my normal muscle tightness and soreness after working out are virtually gone

[1:24:32.920 --> 1:24:50.680]  Canada well the New York Times came out here said all over the world
[1:24:50.680 --> 1:24:54.280]  billions are hit the streets in Catalonia and Spain you name it
[1:24:54.280 --> 1:24:58.200]  saying they want secession as well so the whole world's watching what's
[1:24:58.200 --> 1:25:02.600]  happening in Scotland from Texas to Spain
[1:25:02.600 --> 1:25:06.920]  it's happening and Scottish John is here tell us about that song why I wanted to
[1:25:06.920 --> 1:25:09.080]  air that tell us about the name Scottish John
[1:25:09.080 --> 1:25:12.840]  and then get into what's really happening with Scottish independence and you
[1:25:12.840 --> 1:25:16.600]  were telling me off air all the dirty tricks they're running
[1:25:16.600 --> 1:25:21.080]  trying to stop you guys from getting away from the UK
[1:25:21.080 --> 1:25:26.120]  why wouldn't you get away from England I mean it took England 500 600 years to
[1:25:26.120 --> 1:25:30.280]  finally conquer by force and then you can go back to
[1:25:30.280 --> 1:25:33.160]  Bannock burn and 1314 beating them for a while
[1:25:33.160 --> 1:25:37.880]  I mean this is I just can't believe that uh that that Scotland would ever be
[1:25:37.880 --> 1:25:40.920]  under the UK yeah well that song Alex is a song
[1:25:40.920 --> 1:25:44.840]  called letter from America by a couple of brothers called Craig and Charlie
[1:25:44.840 --> 1:25:49.960]  Reed and it was written in the 80s as a result of
[1:25:49.960 --> 1:25:53.720]  what was happening to industry back home as a result that fractures
[1:25:53.720 --> 1:25:58.840]  policies and we were losing all our jobs industry was being shut down and
[1:25:58.840 --> 1:26:01.880]  people in order to find a job were having to go
[1:26:01.880 --> 1:26:05.480]  wherever they could some people went to America
[1:26:05.480 --> 1:26:09.800]  I ended up going to the Philippines uh because the industry that I was in I
[1:26:09.800 --> 1:26:13.400]  could get work there because my industry in particular which was the textile
[1:26:13.400 --> 1:26:17.480]  industry was all being shipped out to the Far East where labor was very
[1:26:17.480 --> 1:26:21.000]  cheap but of course they needed people with experience and
[1:26:21.000 --> 1:26:24.840]  skill to so I ran a couple of factories out in Manila
[1:26:24.840 --> 1:26:29.480]  in the Philippines um I came back
[1:26:29.480 --> 1:26:33.320]  after two years of that and saw the explosion of
[1:26:33.320 --> 1:26:37.720]  unemployment figures and it's really shocking and basically this
[1:26:37.720 --> 1:26:41.640]  you know this was a specific plan to shut down manufacturing
[1:26:41.640 --> 1:26:45.080]  in Britain and now they've done it here yeah
[1:26:45.080 --> 1:26:48.520]  yeah that shocked me when I came here I guess like most people
[1:26:48.520 --> 1:26:52.440]  I thought America was different and now the robots are going to replace the
[1:26:52.440 --> 1:26:55.560]  people and the globalists say they've got a plan to just get rid of us
[1:26:55.560 --> 1:26:59.400]  yeah well yeah and I guess like most people
[1:26:59.400 --> 1:27:02.120]  when I started hearing the language like that years ago
[1:27:02.120 --> 1:27:06.120]  he's like ah crazy but when you think about it now
[1:27:06.120 --> 1:27:10.440]  no they have no need for us absolutely no need for us
[1:27:10.440 --> 1:27:15.160]  tell me about your t-shirt my t-shirt is uh it's just an acknowledgement of the
[1:27:15.160 --> 1:27:18.680]  Battle of Bannockburn uh it was a battle at Robert the
[1:27:18.680 --> 1:27:22.920]  Bruce one where Scotland gained independence
[1:27:22.920 --> 1:27:26.760]  uh of course William Wallace paved the way for that yeah and
[1:27:26.760 --> 1:27:30.360]  just just on that on that note William Wallace
[1:27:30.360 --> 1:27:33.960]  one of his famous victories with the the Battle of Stirling Bridge
[1:27:33.960 --> 1:27:38.200]  now in this shenanigans that's going on at home at the moment
[1:27:38.200 --> 1:27:42.920]  somebody spray painted a swastika on Stirling Bridge
[1:27:42.920 --> 1:27:47.400]  and that that is just disgusting that is unforgivable
[1:27:47.400 --> 1:27:51.000]  it's unconscionable to do something like that my god
[1:27:51.000 --> 1:27:56.680]  who do you think did it um that's debatable um well talk about
[1:27:56.680 --> 1:27:59.720]  talk about Scottish independence people that don't know why it's so important
[1:27:59.720 --> 1:28:03.000]  because it's already sending shock waves across the world yeah well
[1:28:03.000 --> 1:28:06.520]  what has happened to Scotland economically and socially has been as a
[1:28:06.520 --> 1:28:11.880]  result of Westminster's decisions and traditionally we've had a
[1:28:11.880 --> 1:28:15.800]  conservative or Tory government in Westminster which was never voted in
[1:28:15.800 --> 1:28:20.200]  by Scottish people there'd be very very few Scots who would vote for the Tory
[1:28:20.200 --> 1:28:24.040]  Party but because of the demographics of Britain as a whole
[1:28:24.040 --> 1:28:27.800]  two-thirds of the English the British population lives in the southeastern
[1:28:27.800 --> 1:28:32.520]  section of England so it's tilted in their favour
[1:28:32.520 --> 1:28:36.600]  for representation at Westminster now eventually
[1:28:36.600 --> 1:28:41.400]  they gave us what they call devolution in 1999
[1:28:41.400 --> 1:28:48.120]  you know sort of not real self-determining powers but just to keep us happy you
[1:28:48.120 --> 1:28:50.680]  know and then chuck a couple of sweeties at us as we'd like to see
[1:28:50.680 --> 1:28:53.400]  people that don't know that's why we have the Electoral College here as well
[1:28:53.400 --> 1:28:57.080]  you can't let the more popular states outvote the other states and then
[1:28:57.080 --> 1:29:00.440]  basically makes them their slaves yeah and and that's the same issue you're
[1:29:00.440 --> 1:29:03.640]  dealing with yeah and we always thought the Labour Party
[1:29:03.640 --> 1:29:07.320]  being against the Tories were our friends and of course we find out no
[1:29:07.320 --> 1:29:10.360]  that's not true the Labour Party were popular in Scotland
[1:29:10.360 --> 1:29:13.560]  because that was the only way they were going to retain enough seats in
[1:29:13.560 --> 1:29:16.760]  Westminster to maybe give them a chance to be in the government
[1:29:16.760 --> 1:29:20.680]  well we saw what happened when Tony Blair won for the Labour Party
[1:29:20.680 --> 1:29:23.800]  we kind of support I kind of supported him when he came on the scene
[1:29:23.800 --> 1:29:27.480]  I thought I understood what he was doing he was shifting the sort of Labour
[1:29:27.480 --> 1:29:31.000]  theme more to the centre because like we've got to do something to get the
[1:29:31.000 --> 1:29:35.800]  Tories out but it turns out no he was a shill
[1:29:35.800 --> 1:29:38.520]  absolute shill we're going to come back and talk about
[1:29:38.520 --> 1:29:41.880]  the big vote coming up next week with Scottish John and find out why he calls
[1:29:41.880 --> 1:29:44.520]  himself Scottish John and we'll open the phones up

[1:33:37.720 --> 1:33:41.800]  modern theme music here there's a lot of other news coming up in the next hour
[1:33:41.800 --> 1:33:47.240]  we're going to look at agenda 21 how the globalists destroy national sovereignty
[1:33:47.240 --> 1:33:50.520]  destroy any cultural sovereignty and bring in their plastic
[1:33:50.520 --> 1:33:54.440]  synthetic agenda 21 it's way past zoning
[1:33:54.440 --> 1:34:00.520]  it's unesco global governance down to the political correctness the speech
[1:34:00.520 --> 1:34:04.920]  the light bulbs the toilets the food the roads
[1:34:04.920 --> 1:34:08.360]  it's total global governance covertly being put into place
[1:34:08.360 --> 1:34:13.480]  and england the uk was a very strong wealthy rich people
[1:34:13.480 --> 1:34:19.560]  and so they use the english and others to then just expand this corporatist
[1:34:19.560 --> 1:34:24.280]  black nobility system that had come out of italy basically
[1:34:24.280 --> 1:34:27.720]  and then you had the norman invasion and that brought that imperialistic system
[1:34:27.720 --> 1:34:30.360]  to it and so it's not blaming the uk or the
[1:34:30.360 --> 1:34:34.680]  british people today they're coming to vestigial heart
[1:34:34.680 --> 1:34:41.320]  of this modern planetary program it's just like uh the fact that we see eugenics
[1:34:41.320 --> 1:34:44.680]  coming out of the uk it comes out of the sax cobert
[1:34:44.680 --> 1:34:49.320]  gophos a transylvanian bloodline we first talked about this in the mid 90s
[1:34:49.320 --> 1:34:52.680]  people thought we were crazy it's now mainstream news that
[1:34:52.680 --> 1:34:56.280]  the the british royalty isn't british they have the fake name
[1:34:56.280 --> 1:34:59.800]  winsor that's not their name it's sax cobert gophe
[1:34:59.800 --> 1:35:03.960]  and a bunch of other names and they're not even german they are from
[1:35:03.960 --> 1:35:07.000]  transylvania and are the direct descendants of
[1:35:07.000 --> 1:35:14.680]  vlad the impaler or count dragon count Dracula and that's why the
[1:35:14.680 --> 1:35:20.280]  old symbol for england you know before that i mean they didn't start fully
[1:35:20.280 --> 1:35:23.240]  coming over but a bunch of different houses you had the
[1:35:23.240 --> 1:35:26.920]  plantagenets and then the tutors i'm not gonna go through the whole issue
[1:35:26.920 --> 1:35:30.840]  but for a long time at least 500 years there's been this influence
[1:35:30.840 --> 1:35:35.160]  going on in england and i'm not bashing people from transylvania
[1:35:35.160 --> 1:35:39.960]  it's just that literally the world empire
[1:35:39.960 --> 1:35:45.240]  is goes directly back to count Dracula you cannot make something up this weird
[1:35:45.240 --> 1:35:49.080]  uh truth is stranger than fiction scottish john
[1:35:49.080 --> 1:35:52.360]  get into some of the history of scotland this vote coming up
[1:35:52.360 --> 1:35:56.520]  what some of the scams are that are getting pulled uh to try to
[1:35:56.520 --> 1:36:01.320]  keep you guys from going for independence yeah
[1:36:01.320 --> 1:36:08.360]  this is a this is an issue that is it's hard to to understand these
[1:36:08.360 --> 1:36:14.120]  these people who have treated scotland basically as a poor cousin for hundreds
[1:36:14.120 --> 1:36:17.400]  of years now all of a sudden when we want to leave
[1:36:17.400 --> 1:36:23.560]  they're begging us to stay and the promise in this all will give you
[1:36:23.560 --> 1:36:27.800]  more powers will give you this won't well why didn't you give us this before
[1:36:27.800 --> 1:36:31.880]  the reason we want to part from it is because of the way you've treated us
[1:36:31.880 --> 1:36:35.240]  historically you know well you owe it to your ancestors to be
[1:36:35.240 --> 1:36:38.440]  independent absolutely the blood that's been spilled on
[1:36:38.440 --> 1:36:45.560]  scottish soil over hundreds of years it's just it breaks my heart
[1:36:45.560 --> 1:36:49.080]  and the thing that i'm that i'm concerned about now is
[1:36:49.080 --> 1:36:52.520]  the way this campaign is being manipulated i was listening to some
[1:36:52.520 --> 1:36:56.520]  people in the the northern islands this morning
[1:36:56.520 --> 1:37:01.240]  they they had to do it by postal vote so they they voted over a week ago
[1:37:01.240 --> 1:37:05.160]  and what's happened since then they've heard and well i'm sorry i voted
[1:37:05.160 --> 1:37:09.320]  for no now i want to vote yes but it's too late
[1:37:09.320 --> 1:37:15.160]  there's also the bbc are complicit in in trying to screw this up they're
[1:37:15.160 --> 1:37:18.600]  i'm very disappointed in the bbc hallis the bbc that i knew when i was a
[1:37:18.600 --> 1:37:22.440]  younger man i had complete faith in they're supposed to be on bias because
[1:37:22.440 --> 1:37:26.920]  they're not supported by commercial interests it's paid for by the
[1:37:26.920 --> 1:37:30.680]  the licenced pair the british public but now
[1:37:30.680 --> 1:37:35.640]  they're they're they're in there they're up to their neck and dirty tricks
[1:37:35.640 --> 1:37:38.600]  what are some of the dirty tricks i mean we're hearing from the queen camera and
[1:37:38.600 --> 1:37:42.440]  all of them big banks are going to pull money out on and on and on yeah
[1:37:42.440 --> 1:37:45.960]  but but then you guys will get access to all your own oil and gas
[1:37:45.960 --> 1:37:49.720]  huge reserves of it trillions and trillions of pounds
[1:37:49.720 --> 1:37:54.440]  just ready to be you'll put into the treasury they can almost be like
[1:37:54.440 --> 1:37:57.320]  alaska where the citizens all get a check every year yeah
[1:37:57.320 --> 1:38:00.920]  well what the one of the things they've done is they brought on a so-called expert
[1:38:00.920 --> 1:38:04.120]  and say well you know there's not as much oil left as
[1:38:04.120 --> 1:38:07.320]  you scots think there is so it's going to run out
[1:38:07.320 --> 1:38:11.960]  in what well if we stayed with england it's going to run out anyway
[1:38:11.960 --> 1:38:15.240]  what difference does it make but one thing i found out yesterday
[1:38:15.240 --> 1:38:23.400]  there was a guy he's an ex ambassador to uh where is he um
[1:38:23.400 --> 1:38:27.400]  estonia somewhere like that uh not as bekistan he was an ex ambassador to as
[1:38:27.400 --> 1:38:32.120]  bekistan and it turned out that in 1999 when the
[1:38:32.120 --> 1:38:36.360]  devolution act was being signed over by the west minister parliament by
[1:38:36.360 --> 1:38:41.320]  tony blair the english government shifted the maritime line
[1:38:41.320 --> 1:38:45.080]  in the north sea off the scottish coast and it took away
[1:38:45.080 --> 1:38:48.920]  nine oil fields from scotland and this was done
[1:38:48.920 --> 1:38:51.880]  under the cover of darkness so it's being nobody knew you guys should demand it
[1:38:51.880 --> 1:38:56.600]  back well once you got your country back yes if we get a war with the fall
[1:38:56.600 --> 1:39:00.200]  because they're gonna want the scotland i know yeah it's about sheep imagine
[1:39:00.200 --> 1:39:03.800]  imagine fighting a war for about sheep eh yeah talk about pulling the wool over
[1:39:03.800 --> 1:39:08.120]  your eyes good on me yeah that was thatchert
[1:39:08.120 --> 1:39:13.640]  yeah but yeah it's it's sad to see the dirty tricks that are being played i was
[1:39:13.640 --> 1:39:17.640]  going to say yesterday i saw i saw a video yesterday there's
[1:39:17.640 --> 1:39:21.480]  a bunch of labor mp showed up in glasgole now marching through the center of the
[1:39:21.480 --> 1:39:25.400]  glasgole and there's a guy in a pedicap following him around and he was playing
[1:39:25.400 --> 1:39:30.200]  the seam tune to info wars on a big boombox really loud it was just
[1:39:33.320 --> 1:39:36.200]  giving them all giving them all a bunch of grief but it was they were all going
[1:39:36.200 --> 1:39:40.920]  to see all these no voters you know all these people these stupid no
[1:39:40.920 --> 1:39:45.080]  so i don't understand well explain so so how do you vote if you do want to have
[1:39:45.080 --> 1:39:49.320]  sovereignty you vote yes yes but they've confused it
[1:39:49.320 --> 1:39:53.080]  where people think you vote no oh did i say did i see the wrong thing there
[1:39:53.080 --> 1:39:57.480]  yeah that's it they're turning muddy the water so much and
[1:39:57.480 --> 1:40:01.560]  you'll see something on youtube for example and then you read the comments
[1:40:01.560 --> 1:40:04.680]  and the comments are like chalk and cheese and you think yourself well how
[1:40:04.680 --> 1:40:08.120]  do you take from what he just said so differently from someone else
[1:40:08.120 --> 1:40:11.400]  it'd be like you saying to me nelson mandela was white
[1:40:11.400 --> 1:40:14.840]  and i say no wait a minute i don't think so how could you well that's like
[1:40:14.840 --> 1:40:16.920]  obama's saying there's no boots on the ground
[1:40:16.920 --> 1:40:20.040]  when he just sent 1400 troops in the last month
[1:40:20.040 --> 1:40:23.640]  400 of them the day he says it over to fight
[1:40:23.640 --> 1:40:27.400]  supposedly isis and then he says that isis is an islamic
[1:40:27.400 --> 1:40:30.680]  i mean it's just lying to our face and i know they've done it for a while but
[1:40:30.680 --> 1:40:34.680]  now it's really getting intense what are some of the other dirty tricks
[1:40:34.680 --> 1:40:37.800]  go over some of the history of scotland for folks that don't know some of the
[1:40:37.800 --> 1:40:43.000]  basics well we just we just a country of
[1:40:43.000 --> 1:40:45.720]  people that just wanted to mind their own business
[1:40:45.720 --> 1:40:50.120]  historically we had the clans and we had a different
[1:40:50.120 --> 1:40:53.560]  kind of way of living than the english you know
[1:40:53.560 --> 1:40:57.800]  the sometimes yeah sometimes there'd be a skirmish between the clans but there
[1:40:57.800 --> 1:41:03.000]  was always a lot of respect uh one of the one of the dark incident
[1:41:03.000 --> 1:41:08.680]  clans or tribes yeah tribes basically yeah and
[1:41:08.680 --> 1:41:14.440]  we we fought the last jackabite campaign the famous bonnie prince charlie
[1:41:14.440 --> 1:41:19.640]  thing the second jackabite uprising in 1745 and
[1:41:19.640 --> 1:41:23.880]  and we lost that the english came in and carried out what they called the highland
[1:41:23.880 --> 1:41:27.160]  clearances which kind of scattered the scots all over the globe
[1:41:27.160 --> 1:41:31.640]  but just prior to that there was the famous battle in ireland by
[1:41:31.640 --> 1:41:35.080]  prince william of orange the the guy who came from holland
[1:41:35.080 --> 1:41:38.840]  and kind of got plonked on the vacant english throne at the time
[1:41:38.840 --> 1:41:43.480]  and this was a this was a religious war the protestant orange
[1:41:43.480 --> 1:41:47.880]  against king james's catholic troops and
[1:41:47.880 --> 1:41:51.560]  what what happened shortly after that was
[1:41:51.560 --> 1:41:55.400]  while they're trying to sort out all the business with the clans up in scotland
[1:41:55.400 --> 1:41:59.240]  stop us from wearing the tartan and badness from playing bagpipes and
[1:41:59.240 --> 1:42:03.800]  just trying to destroy our culture basically the all the clan chiefs were
[1:42:03.800 --> 1:42:06.360]  called to inverness which is a city in the north of
[1:42:06.360 --> 1:42:11.320]  scotland to pay their taxes now william of orange had set up
[1:42:11.320 --> 1:42:14.600]  this thing to where
[1:42:15.160 --> 1:42:20.760]  the mcdonald clan were coming over the highlands and because of the weather
[1:42:20.760 --> 1:42:24.600]  they were getting slowed down so they stopped at the campbell
[1:42:24.600 --> 1:42:28.040]  headquarters you know their camp and it was a scottish tradition
[1:42:28.040 --> 1:42:31.400]  if a different clan was visiting you showed them hospitality you put them
[1:42:31.400 --> 1:42:34.440]  up they fed them well what they did there was in the dark
[1:42:34.440 --> 1:42:39.080]  and night they slaughtered the mcdonald clan they murdered them in cold
[1:42:39.080 --> 1:42:44.200]  blood and that's just that's the kind of tricks
[1:42:44.200 --> 1:42:48.680]  that they've played against us over the years you know i'm not i'm not a
[1:42:48.680 --> 1:42:53.000]  really educated historian alex but uh just basically we've been a
[1:42:53.000 --> 1:42:55.800]  we've been a well it's the old saying well why did the sun never set on the
[1:42:55.800 --> 1:42:59.160]  british empire exactly because god wouldn't trust an englishman
[1:42:59.160 --> 1:43:03.480]  in the dark that's pretty funny yeah i mean i mean i'm
[1:43:03.480 --> 1:43:06.600]  welsh and everything but i'm a hind's 57 i don't have a dog in the fight i can
[1:43:06.600 --> 1:43:11.240]  just see the center of government manipulation the fraud
[1:43:11.240 --> 1:43:14.760]  systems that were brought into the uk that were brought into those you know
[1:43:14.760 --> 1:43:18.840]  islands is now the global system and people need to be aware of that exactly
[1:43:18.840 --> 1:43:22.280]  so it is a big defeat for the establishment
[1:43:22.280 --> 1:43:26.840]  if scotland breaks away in my view yeah there are some pitfalls because then
[1:43:26.840 --> 1:43:29.720]  you've got competing globalist arms you'll just have golden sacks come in
[1:43:29.720 --> 1:43:32.600]  there and try to take over your government and buy you off that way
[1:43:32.600 --> 1:43:37.240]  even slicker but still it's the self-determination
[1:43:37.240 --> 1:43:40.520]  of the fact that your country's been conquered for 300 years you want to get
[1:43:40.520 --> 1:43:43.160]  it back yeah and kind of the you know one of the
[1:43:43.160 --> 1:43:46.120]  tricks we'll play is there was an excellent example of this in the movie
[1:43:46.120 --> 1:43:49.000]  braveheart world long shanks is saying that well
[1:43:49.000 --> 1:43:52.360]  we'll offer such and such a clan chief we'll give them estates
[1:43:52.360 --> 1:43:55.640]  and lands and such and such an area you know just to break
[1:43:55.640 --> 1:44:00.600]  but further down the line you know he's going to come and murder that guy
[1:44:00.600 --> 1:44:05.640]  and what happened during my lifetime in my working life there when all the
[1:44:05.640 --> 1:44:09.320]  jobs were lost and the manufacturing industry just collapsed
[1:44:09.320 --> 1:44:13.320]  they were very clever in that they left a certain amount of people in work
[1:44:13.320 --> 1:44:17.880]  just to maintain the status quo so to speak they do it in phases
[1:44:17.880 --> 1:44:21.400]  yeah but to keep to keep those those people then
[1:44:21.400 --> 1:44:24.600]  they would zip it because they didn't want to lose their jobs
[1:44:24.600 --> 1:44:28.840]  you know so that's that's how they it's the old divide and conquer thing
[1:44:28.840 --> 1:44:31.080]  they know what they're doing well absolutely you got a bunch of notes
[1:44:31.080 --> 1:44:33.720]  let's run through your notes here you got like three pages of stuff you wrote
[1:44:33.720 --> 1:44:36.280]  here yeah well just looking at some of the things
[1:44:36.280 --> 1:44:39.960]  it's being discussed in this and i've watched the two live debates with
[1:44:39.960 --> 1:44:43.480]  salmon and allister darling what a name eh darling
[1:44:43.480 --> 1:44:48.520]  oh god eh a third of the scottish budget goes on
[1:44:48.520 --> 1:44:52.360]  healthcare now what does that what does that say about a country that a third of
[1:44:52.360 --> 1:44:56.440]  your budget has to go on healthcare why is that
[1:44:56.440 --> 1:45:00.040]  that's because people don't have jobs that pay them enough
[1:45:00.040 --> 1:45:03.800]  to maintain a decent level of health they're not even proper food
[1:45:03.800 --> 1:45:07.720]  you know that's well people start dying when you go under a national health
[1:45:07.720 --> 1:45:11.800]  service yeah absolutely ehm
[1:45:14.360 --> 1:45:17.960]  alex salmon and david cameron there's two cheeks on the same ass
[1:45:17.960 --> 1:45:22.520]  that's all i can say you know i'm not a big fan of alex salmon
[1:45:22.520 --> 1:45:27.480]  ehm i was never a never a big supporter of the the scottish national party to be
[1:45:27.480 --> 1:45:30.760]  honest when i was a younger man i supported the labor party
[1:45:30.760 --> 1:45:34.280]  of course when i got older and wiser i just realized
[1:45:34.280 --> 1:45:37.880]  naive you know but when you're younger what would the young people
[1:45:37.880 --> 1:45:40.920]  think about when they're not that interested in politics if you're a
[1:45:40.920 --> 1:45:43.240]  young man there's two things you're interested in
[1:45:43.240 --> 1:45:47.160]  let's not say them well that's women and maybe sport me i love to play
[1:45:47.160 --> 1:45:50.680]  football uh soccer as you all call it see with me i wasn't interested in sports
[1:45:50.680 --> 1:45:55.160]  it was just one thing i thought i'd clean it off you know
[1:45:55.160 --> 1:45:58.840]  yeah yeah now here's here's here's another thing
[1:45:58.840 --> 1:46:01.960]  i this isn't really to do with scottish independence but this is just another
[1:46:01.960 --> 1:46:06.520]  thing of of how these people work i remember when when maggie thatcher
[1:46:06.520 --> 1:46:11.800]  was uh it was prime minister he started privatizing all the national
[1:46:11.800 --> 1:46:15.000]  assets like the gas and the water and the electricity
[1:46:15.000 --> 1:46:19.880]  and they offered the british people shares you know you want to be a shareholder
[1:46:19.880 --> 1:46:23.160]  and all they want to be yuppies back then said oh yeah i want to buy shares
[1:46:23.160 --> 1:46:26.360]  oh look i'm a shareholder in bt a big deal
[1:46:26.360 --> 1:46:29.880]  you know but further down the line of course
[1:46:29.880 --> 1:46:33.880]  they're tempted into selling us because they're offered such a great price
[1:46:33.880 --> 1:46:36.760]  they'll sell them and they may be double their money but
[1:46:36.760 --> 1:46:40.200]  what happens then that ownership is then concentrated
[1:46:40.200 --> 1:46:43.880]  now what happened i'll give you one example that sticks in in my mind
[1:46:43.880 --> 1:46:49.800]  is southeast water authority in england was bought over by a french company
[1:46:49.800 --> 1:46:53.640]  now what can a government allows a foreign
[1:46:53.640 --> 1:46:57.160]  entity to buy something well that's it that's why
[1:46:57.160 --> 1:47:01.080]  the globalists want to have their own orchestrated breakaways in countries
[1:47:01.080 --> 1:47:05.000]  but then it goes under a new conglomerate if you if a country breaks
[1:47:05.000 --> 1:47:08.680]  away to its original state then it's based on culture
[1:47:08.680 --> 1:47:12.040]  it tends to have a chance of actually doing something better and this is all a
[1:47:12.040 --> 1:47:16.200]  big experiment but exactly the uk has already
[1:47:16.200 --> 1:47:19.880]  got 83 percent of its laws on record made by the eu
[1:47:19.880 --> 1:47:24.680]  that is literally goldman sacks jp morgan exactly so you're forced to secede
[1:47:24.680 --> 1:47:27.400]  just because even if you wanted to stay in the uk
[1:47:27.400 --> 1:47:31.000]  it's been conquered yeah and i and you know i really like nizel forage and
[1:47:31.000 --> 1:47:34.680]  ukip and the rest of them but you know they're even pro crown
[1:47:34.680 --> 1:47:38.680]  their argument is well it's better than the eu which is our new king and queen so
[1:47:38.680 --> 1:47:41.880]  i get that at a certain level but at the same time ukip's got to
[1:47:41.880 --> 1:47:44.600]  support you guys because they are the independence party
[1:47:44.600 --> 1:47:48.040]  and now all these other states want to get out of the eu in europe
[1:47:48.040 --> 1:47:51.160]  um and and what do you think of the rest of the world looking at scotland
[1:47:51.160 --> 1:47:54.280]  catalonian spain texas a bunch of other places
[1:47:54.280 --> 1:47:57.880]  are now wanting to secede watching what the scots are doing both part of them
[1:47:57.880 --> 1:48:01.080]  i mean what greater gift can a a human being have than the right of self
[1:48:01.080 --> 1:48:04.360]  determination now you just mentioned something there
[1:48:04.360 --> 1:48:08.360]  uh the the the ukip thing the scots the even
[1:48:08.360 --> 1:48:13.720]  even if scotland gets independence we're still going to be a part of the eu
[1:48:13.720 --> 1:48:17.560]  to me i don't make a lot of sense you know i've heard
[1:48:17.560 --> 1:48:20.920]  that there's supposed to be a referendum on that further down the line
[1:48:20.920 --> 1:48:25.720]  exactly you pull out you pull out of the of the uk then you pull out of the eu
[1:48:25.720 --> 1:48:29.160]  yeah we were we were lied to about it was the common
[1:48:29.160 --> 1:48:32.040]  market back then i don't mean it was they just said it was a trade deal yeah
[1:48:32.040 --> 1:48:35.480]  and did you get jobs from it no the jobs went away on
[1:48:35.480 --> 1:48:40.520]  we didn't know just like naftan get absolutely the farmers lost work
[1:48:40.520 --> 1:48:44.040]  you know same you know what different you know what yeah i mean
[1:48:44.040 --> 1:48:47.400]  it is just the same globalist mercantile scam look
[1:48:47.400 --> 1:48:51.320]  when england ran the colonies they wouldn't let us have manufactured goods
[1:48:51.320 --> 1:48:54.200]  we had to send it back to england and buy it back
[1:48:54.200 --> 1:48:57.720]  as a way to control people that was the main reason for the war wasn't even the
[1:48:57.720 --> 1:49:00.200]  taxes is that they wouldn't let us have industry
[1:49:00.200 --> 1:49:03.640]  this is how the globalist control things now they've just moved everything to
[1:49:03.640 --> 1:49:07.960]  china out of the us out of even mexico out of
[1:49:07.960 --> 1:49:11.720]  scotland out of ireland this is how they control they go oh you're going to be a
[1:49:11.720 --> 1:49:15.880]  service economy now yeah and then now that's not even
[1:49:15.880 --> 1:49:19.560]  working no it's specific well look we have to buy
[1:49:19.560 --> 1:49:23.240]  local we have to be sovereign we have to vote with our dollars doesn't mean any
[1:49:23.240 --> 1:49:26.040]  of us are perfect but that's how you grow an economy yeah
[1:49:26.040 --> 1:49:30.600]  you're familiar with the name chuck harter yes yeah well chuck harter made a
[1:49:30.600 --> 1:49:33.880]  very important point one thing i've wanted to get him on the show he's
[1:49:33.880 --> 1:49:37.400]  he's really the proto rush limbaugh there's three things that a society
[1:49:37.400 --> 1:49:42.920]  needs in order to thrive and that is manufacturing mining and agriculture
[1:49:42.920 --> 1:49:47.080]  and if you if you don't have those three things to a certain degree
[1:49:47.080 --> 1:49:50.920]  then you ain't going to survive and under globalism they don't want any country
[1:49:50.920 --> 1:49:54.120]  to have all three or even two of those absolutely because they want to the
[1:49:54.120 --> 1:49:58.680]  globalist control from outside with their deals who can get what yeah
[1:49:58.680 --> 1:50:01.880]  and this is what people in scotland need to realize now
[1:50:01.880 --> 1:50:05.720]  another interesting aspect of this is the voting age for this particular thing
[1:50:05.720 --> 1:50:09.960]  this referendum is being dropped to 16 years old
[1:50:09.960 --> 1:50:14.520]  i'm just hoping that they're wise enough and well enough informed
[1:50:14.520 --> 1:50:17.800]  that they're going to vote the right way well i've been seeing the news though
[1:50:17.800 --> 1:50:21.960]  that that targets young people it's all stay in the uk stay in the yeah it's a
[1:50:21.960 --> 1:50:24.920]  bunch of brainwashing you know i over the years i left
[1:50:24.920 --> 1:50:30.280]  scotland in uh in 1969 when my when my folks split up and i ended up in
[1:50:30.280 --> 1:50:35.640]  england and over the years as i was traveling up home to visit i could just
[1:50:35.640 --> 1:50:39.720]  see the industrial landscape deteriorating year after year
[1:50:39.720 --> 1:50:42.840]  and also in northern england look at sheffield absolutely
[1:50:42.840 --> 1:50:47.000]  absolutely yeah sheffield the steel industry that was a massive industry
[1:50:47.000 --> 1:50:50.440]  and sheffield years ago but they're not allowed to have any of it now and had to
[1:50:50.440 --> 1:50:54.760]  all move to india because of carbon taxes and india pays none and then the un
[1:50:54.760 --> 1:51:00.840]  head pechari made the money oh isn't that loving this hour brought to you by

[2:01:34.520 --> 2:01:38.040]  scottish john do you know who dale watson is yes
[2:01:38.040 --> 2:01:42.360]  dale gave me that nickname when i came to austin i i'd known dale i'd seen him
[2:01:42.360 --> 2:01:45.640]  play three times in london so i probably met dale
[2:01:45.640 --> 2:01:50.520]  either 95 or 96 and when i came to austin
[2:01:50.520 --> 2:01:54.920]  he used to get me up and sing with his band up at jenny's little longhorn
[2:01:54.920 --> 2:01:59.320]  and he just called me scottish john now when your hero
[2:01:59.320 --> 2:02:02.840]  dale wasn't my hero because of what he's done for country music
[2:02:02.840 --> 2:02:06.840]  you know i'm a country musician myself and what happened with country music in
[2:02:06.840 --> 2:02:10.840]  the 90s i thought that was the cia did that because it's
[2:02:10.840 --> 2:02:14.040]  horrible well they didn't like outlaw country they ruined it on purpose
[2:02:14.040 --> 2:02:17.880]  so that's why that's why i carry the name scottish john with a lot of pride
[2:02:17.880 --> 2:02:20.280]  because dale watson gave me that nickname
[2:02:20.280 --> 2:02:23.560]  very interesting i know i know welton knows him he people love him all over the

[2:12:25.880 --> 2:12:30.120]  as he was on the cell phone leaving the capital getting in his car
[2:12:30.120 --> 2:12:34.200]  two days ago and he said it's i said is it 65 percent of al-qaeda like we're
[2:12:34.200 --> 2:12:36.760]  told he goes no it's way above that and then i
[2:12:36.760 --> 2:12:39.720]  he said but classified i can't tell you so then i just talked a little bird
[2:12:39.720 --> 2:12:46.440]  later and it was 95 percent but the point is 95 percent congress has been
[2:12:46.440 --> 2:12:51.480]  briefed is al-qaeda now known as is or isl to confuse the public
[2:12:51.480 --> 2:12:57.000]  that is huge and now the non-radicals all were called

[2:13:00.520 --> 2:13:04.440]  and i'm afraid the whole building blew up
[2:13:04.440 --> 2:13:08.440]  nearly 50 senior commanders of a major coalition of islamic moderates
[2:13:08.440 --> 2:13:12.040]  opposed to isis and syria have been killed by an explosion at their secret

[2:13:28.440 --> 2:13:32.440]  to ever believe any of the intel they're giving the west isn't going right to is
[2:13:32.440 --> 2:13:36.440]  to make sure they get taken out saudi arabia runs ish
[2:13:36.440 --> 2:13:41.480]  with the west and they are not going to have anybody get in the way of that
[2:13:41.480 --> 2:13:46.120]  this war will be to mop up any rebels not controlled by al-qaeda
[2:13:46.120 --> 2:13:49.400]  and the public will be told it is to take out al-qaeda
[2:13:49.400 --> 2:13:55.880]  and that's jerome coursey that's colonel shaffer that's top generals on fox news

[2:14:24.040 --> 2:14:28.920]  what's happening because when you wonder why you can't have a light bulb or why

[2:16:41.080 --> 2:16:44.920]  it's in your elementary school all the way up to your postgraduate school
[2:16:44.920 --> 2:16:50.760]  and this is the idea is to create um regional alliances so it's about
[2:16:50.760 --> 2:16:57.160]  breaking down our our alliances our loyalty our connection with our national
[2:16:57.160 --> 2:17:01.320]  uh in identity and i think it's interesting that we're talking about
[2:17:01.320 --> 2:17:05.960]  freedom movements for uh for um for people around the world
[2:17:05.960 --> 2:17:11.160]  because the idea anything that destroys um the existing order
[2:17:11.160 --> 2:17:17.240]  is going to further ultimately agenda 21 because it's about destroying um
[2:17:17.240 --> 2:17:23.800]  and transforming what we consider to be normal and in order to do that it
[2:17:23.800 --> 2:17:28.680]  requires a tremendous transformation as elgor said it's a wrenching
[2:17:28.680 --> 2:17:32.840]  transformation so uh this is mental it's you know it's
[2:17:32.840 --> 2:17:37.880]  beyond bernay's this is way beyond bernay's way beyond skinner
[2:17:37.880 --> 2:17:41.960]  way beyond hegel this is absolutely taking us to a point where
[2:17:41.960 --> 2:17:46.680]  we are terrorized to the point where we are actually going to break with our
[2:17:46.680 --> 2:17:53.560]  old identity with our old uh alliances and rearrange the world in a sort of a
[2:17:53.560 --> 2:17:58.280]  regional um sort of new framework and this is what the
[2:17:58.280 --> 2:18:00.200]  goal is that's right they're bringing in the
[2:18:00.200 --> 2:18:04.520]  worldwide cascade of crises should we go into learn helplessness
[2:18:04.520 --> 2:18:08.920]  roll over and say just we'll do whatever you say just stop it
[2:18:08.920 --> 2:18:13.320]  yeah that's right and you know of course it's very effective because we are just
[2:18:13.320 --> 2:18:17.720]  you know we're not trained to deal with this level of stress
[2:18:17.720 --> 2:18:22.120]  and uh so you know whether it's a ebola or you're terrified you're going to get
[2:18:22.120 --> 2:18:25.400]  your head cut off when you're on the way to the grocery store
[2:18:25.400 --> 2:18:28.520]  you know or you're getting padded down like a common criminal when you want to
[2:18:28.520 --> 2:18:32.680]  fly and see grandma um this whole you know this entire
[2:18:32.680 --> 2:18:36.840]  way of destroying your ability to think clearly
[2:18:36.840 --> 2:18:41.480]  is a definite uh plan this is the way that we are
[2:18:41.480 --> 2:18:45.000]  you know that this is being determined is how
[2:18:45.000 --> 2:18:49.400]  the main way of thinking can be totally changed this is
[2:18:49.400 --> 2:18:52.840]  this is actually called second and third order change
[2:18:52.840 --> 2:18:57.080]  and this is part of the way that we're being uh propagandized and for folks that
[2:18:57.080 --> 2:18:58.760]  don't know we'll talk about when we come back
[2:18:58.760 --> 2:19:02.200]  they have their delphi technique they go to seminars none of this is even
[2:19:02.200 --> 2:19:05.480]  secret they all write books about how they're nudging us
[2:19:05.480 --> 2:19:08.600]  they're manipulating us and they're far from liberal
[2:19:08.600 --> 2:19:12.840]  thomas jefferson was a liberal uh you know valterra was a liberal
[2:19:12.840 --> 2:19:17.560]  these people are social engineers yeah that's right i mean you might call them
[2:19:17.560 --> 2:19:22.440]  radical reactionaries uh who are extremely conservative in what
[2:19:22.440 --> 2:19:26.760]  they're going to allow you to think you know they may pose themselves as being
[2:19:26.760 --> 2:19:31.960]  super you know liberal cool but in fact you know the progressive mindset
[2:19:31.960 --> 2:19:36.200]  is restrictive all right i'm gonna give you the floor for the

[2:24:25.720 --> 2:24:30.600]  get us to accept wars and turn on our guns in and tsa well the border is wide

[2:24:43.720 --> 2:24:46.520]  a very successful activist on communicating to people
[2:24:46.520 --> 2:24:50.600]  what we're facing rosa i want to get into the latest of what's unfolding but
[2:24:50.600 --> 2:24:54.440]  what is from your view traveling the country in the world
[2:24:54.440 --> 2:24:58.440]  this is not just in the u.s. is worldwide what is the state
[2:24:58.440 --> 2:25:02.360]  of their attempted takeover i see them panicking all over the news
[2:25:02.360 --> 2:25:05.880]  uh first trying to deny it now i'm trying to say it's good to be run by the
[2:25:05.880 --> 2:25:10.600]  un where is all this going well where it's going uh
[2:25:10.600 --> 2:25:15.320]  unless we stop it is of course you know unfortunately the reality of one world
[2:25:15.320 --> 2:25:19.160]  government or uh you know the clash of the titans
[2:25:19.160 --> 2:25:22.920]  um we're talking about full regionalization in
[2:25:22.920 --> 2:25:28.760]  you know as the lead up to to entire globalization totalitarian state and
[2:25:28.760 --> 2:25:32.440]  that's you know this is what the war on terror is about to
[2:25:32.440 --> 2:25:35.480]  you know create this perpetual war that we actually
[2:25:35.480 --> 2:25:38.920]  create our enemy and then you know continually
[2:25:38.920 --> 2:25:43.560]  fund and perpetuate that so that uh it actually
[2:25:43.560 --> 2:25:47.000]  pushes us into these mega regions which are then
[2:25:47.000 --> 2:25:52.520]  essentially fiefdoms princeton's uh you know that are going to be used as uh
[2:25:52.520 --> 2:25:56.920]  for totalitarian control so um that's the goal
[2:25:56.920 --> 2:26:00.920]  i think that uh as i travel around the country and around the world what i've
[2:26:00.920 --> 2:26:06.040]  seen is tremendous tremendous um rising in
[2:26:06.040 --> 2:26:09.640]  awareness and people who are actually working together
[2:26:09.640 --> 2:26:12.680]  to fight this and they understand it's local
[2:26:12.680 --> 2:26:16.200]  um that you know there's not really much that you're going to be doing about it
[2:26:16.200 --> 2:26:21.160]  internationally but you are in power locally if you take your power
[2:26:21.160 --> 2:26:24.680]  so uh what what you need to do is be very strong
[2:26:24.680 --> 2:26:29.160]  mentally and emotionally to withstand the tremendous
[2:26:29.160 --> 2:26:34.840]  power of uh social propaganda and behavioral modification that's coming
[2:26:34.840 --> 2:26:39.560]  at you from the press from your universities um
[2:26:39.560 --> 2:26:44.360]  in every small local organization uh you know talk about infiltration i mean
[2:26:44.360 --> 2:26:49.160]  you have major uh international groups you have local groups you have
[2:26:49.160 --> 2:26:52.760]  nonprofits this is all public private partnerships that are
[2:26:52.760 --> 2:26:56.200]  funded through your government and then work with
[2:26:56.200 --> 2:26:59.880]  you know for instance like the smart growth network uh which is a
[2:26:59.880 --> 2:27:03.800]  united nations agenda 21 sustainable development group
[2:27:03.800 --> 2:27:07.560]  which is funded and put together by the environmental protection agency the
[2:27:07.560 --> 2:27:10.920]  united states federal agency and then it includes
[2:27:10.920 --> 2:27:15.880]  lots of private partners like the american planning association
[2:27:15.880 --> 2:27:19.880]  um you know you've got a smart growth network you've got
[2:27:19.880 --> 2:27:23.880]  and then you've got universities in there so in other words what you're having
[2:27:23.880 --> 2:27:27.720]  what you see is clusters of groups that have a single
[2:27:27.720 --> 2:27:31.800]  focus and that is to change the way that you think
[2:27:31.800 --> 2:27:36.520]  and to disempower you while giving you the impression that this is making you a
[2:27:36.520 --> 2:27:40.280]  better human being so about creating the new man
[2:27:40.280 --> 2:27:44.360]  somebody who's you know giving back and thinking about
[2:27:44.360 --> 2:27:50.840]  others self-effacing ego destroying this is the concept that's being used
[2:27:50.840 --> 2:27:54.520]  throughout schools throughout local organization and this is what cults
[2:27:54.520 --> 2:27:57.720]  classically do with their brainwashed servants
[2:27:57.720 --> 2:28:02.600]  jim jones uh any of them they want these little mindless zombies
[2:28:02.600 --> 2:28:06.040]  that do whatever they're told while the elites fly around in jumbo jets with
[2:28:06.040 --> 2:28:11.480]  red carpets it is literal mind control yeah and you know here's the thing you
[2:28:11.480 --> 2:28:15.720]  don't expect it to come from a government agency
[2:28:15.720 --> 2:28:19.400]  i mean if you join jim jones you know you're like okay well it's kind of
[2:28:19.400 --> 2:28:23.640]  weird here and i'm often yana for a reason but no i mean you've got this
[2:28:23.640 --> 2:28:29.480]  stuff coming at you from noah from the you know oceanographic uh uh agency
[2:28:29.480 --> 2:28:35.080]  you've got it from the epa you got msnbc saying two plus two equals five
[2:28:35.080 --> 2:28:38.760]  and then our kids don't belong to us they're purposely trying to overwhelm
[2:28:38.760 --> 2:28:41.880]  us right now yeah and this is the thing is that you
[2:28:41.880 --> 2:28:46.360]  really i i can't emphasize this enough how you got to keep your sense of humor
[2:28:46.360 --> 2:28:51.560]  be able to step back from this and say hey man you know this is you know you
[2:28:51.560 --> 2:28:57.160]  cannot expect me to fall in line with this with this line that you're
[2:28:57.160 --> 2:29:00.760]  feeding me because uh you know this is something these
[2:29:00.760 --> 2:29:05.160]  are people who are truly trained and are uh are actually
[2:29:05.160 --> 2:29:10.920]  experts at changing the way that you think and behave and you know i can
[2:29:10.920 --> 2:29:14.840]  give you an example i mean this is you know this is these are orders of change
[2:29:14.840 --> 2:29:19.000]  that are determined and they're taught in universities this is organizational
[2:29:19.000 --> 2:29:22.840]  management and uh you know you might have the association
[2:29:22.840 --> 2:29:26.920]  for advancement of sustainability in higher education
[2:29:26.920 --> 2:29:31.800]  that's a group that is training uh professors no matter what oh yeah we have
[2:29:31.800 --> 2:29:35.240]  them right here in austin and it turns out they're cia i'm gonna come back to
[2:29:35.240 --> 2:29:38.520]  you to explain how they create this artificial spectrum
[2:29:38.520 --> 2:29:41.720]  where it looks like every institution is agreeing
[2:29:41.720 --> 2:29:45.160]  but it's all run by the same people it sounds like it's hard to defeat
[2:29:45.160 --> 2:29:49.320]  but knowing is 90 percent of the battle then it all is so clear we're on the

[2:33:36.680 --> 2:33:39.240]  ratified it kind of like we're not ratifying the carbon
[2:33:39.240 --> 2:33:44.520]  taxes obama says he'll just sign an executive order
[2:33:44.520 --> 2:33:48.680]  or he'll open the borders and then the un gives him the authority
[2:33:48.680 --> 2:33:52.280]  this is so incredible well the crew just came in with a cnn article we're

[2:33:56.600 --> 2:34:01.640]  david r wheeler who is a trader uh in the past in my view
[2:34:01.640 --> 2:34:05.160]  in the past few years as america's degenerated into a political and
[2:34:05.160 --> 2:34:07.560]  economic chaos it has become increasingly clear
[2:34:07.560 --> 2:34:10.600]  we'll be far better off if we apologize for our revolt
[2:34:10.600 --> 2:34:14.600]  against the crown and request to rejoin the united kingdom
[2:34:14.600 --> 2:34:18.360]  while it wasn't called the united kingdom them jackass excuse me
[2:34:18.360 --> 2:34:22.600]  it was called the british empire
[2:34:22.600 --> 2:34:27.640]  and it was incredibly corrupt and designed the first concentration camps
[2:34:27.640 --> 2:34:31.480]  that were then used against native americans
[2:34:31.480 --> 2:34:34.760]  see i actually have read hundreds of books on the british empire
[2:34:34.760 --> 2:34:38.920]  back when i had time i read history books every week i still do sometimes
[2:34:38.920 --> 2:34:43.160]  when i go on vacation or something i mean i'm really into it and i've seen
[2:34:43.160 --> 2:34:47.400]  all this british propaganda people always talk about the israel lobby
[2:34:47.400 --> 2:34:50.280]  manipulating us we're going to rose a quarry here in a moment
[2:34:50.280 --> 2:34:53.480]  and i don't like the fact that that's going on but there's the saudi arabian
[2:34:53.480 --> 2:34:57.480]  interest the chinese telling us what movies we can have and rea america is
[2:34:57.480 --> 2:35:00.440]  like just a joke now and i'm not saying that to bash the
[2:35:00.440 --> 2:35:03.640]  country i love the country we need to admit it
[2:35:03.640 --> 2:35:07.080]  all of this they set up the council on fine relations in 1922
[2:35:07.080 --> 2:35:11.480]  to anglophile as they call it with british intelligence new york
[2:35:11.480 --> 2:35:16.360]  it became the fad then to speak with an Atlantic accent like thirst and how
[2:35:16.360 --> 2:35:22.280]  oh that was people doing an affected british accent
[2:35:22.280 --> 2:35:24.600]  okay
[2:35:25.000 --> 2:35:28.200]  and you couldn't even get into high society unless you had like these
[2:35:28.200 --> 2:35:31.080]  connections or been on the mayflower and stuff like that they have all these
[2:35:31.080 --> 2:35:36.680]  societies okay and that really goes on and i'm not
[2:35:36.680 --> 2:35:40.280]  here bashing the british people they're great they're huge listeners
[2:35:40.280 --> 2:35:44.600]  the globalist parasites took it over because it was a great country
[2:35:44.600 --> 2:35:47.880]  just like the global issues america to carry out all their operations and then
[2:35:47.880 --> 2:35:50.440]  blame america for it in the end this is what the new
[2:35:50.440 --> 2:35:53.560]  old order is about but i see all these articles the
[2:35:53.560 --> 2:35:56.760]  boss in globe she is the declaration of independence
[2:35:56.760 --> 2:35:59.640]  illegal to say that we could overthrow a government
[2:35:59.640 --> 2:36:03.240]  they're fundamentally attacking the founding fathers not that they were
[2:36:03.240 --> 2:36:07.800]  perfect but because what they want to bring in is the opposite
[2:36:07.800 --> 2:36:12.280]  and when cnn has articles this is an interview it's a transcript
[2:36:12.280 --> 2:36:15.880]  david r wheeler lives in lexington kentucky where he is a freelance writer
[2:36:15.880 --> 2:36:20.120]  and journalist professor at asbury university
[2:36:20.120 --> 2:36:23.160]  got a tweet at him and say you know if this country was
[2:36:23.160 --> 2:36:25.880]  you know still a sovereign nation people like him would be up on trees and
[2:36:25.880 --> 2:36:28.440]  charges
[2:36:28.440 --> 2:36:33.960]  totally sick but but again what what was rosa quarry just saying 10 minutes ago
[2:36:33.960 --> 2:36:37.880]  it's about shocking us into submission just your kids belong to us two plus two
[2:36:37.880 --> 2:36:41.240]  equals five you didn't build your business we'd be better off under the
[2:36:41.240 --> 2:36:44.440]  queen of england england is in shambles just like we are
[2:36:44.440 --> 2:36:48.440]  because the globalists are sucking it dry deindustrializing it the rich
[2:36:48.440 --> 2:36:52.120]  government bureaucrats own steel plants in india
[2:36:52.120 --> 2:36:56.600]  and ordered the ones in sheffield shut down and then literally british ministers
[2:36:56.600 --> 2:37:00.920]  with pochari of the un who wrote the carbon tax
[2:37:00.920 --> 2:37:04.760]  literally then own the steel mills
[2:37:05.480 --> 2:37:09.880]  i mean it's just it's unbelievable rosa i'm ranting
[2:37:09.880 --> 2:37:13.640]  your books available in info or store.com
[2:37:13.640 --> 2:37:17.320]  and everybody should go there and get it and give it to everybody they know
[2:37:17.320 --> 2:37:20.680]  people should buy boxes of this we can beat these people as you said
[2:37:20.680 --> 2:37:24.200]  there's a global awakening right now but we got to go over the top
[2:37:24.200 --> 2:37:27.960]  because now even when we wake people up and we are fighting it all over you
[2:37:27.960 --> 2:37:31.000]  were getting into we went last year and talked to this ut professor
[2:37:31.000 --> 2:37:35.080]  about the agenda 21 uh office he has and smart growth
[2:37:35.080 --> 2:37:38.600]  and when i've gone to these conferences they laugh and admit it's a political
[2:37:38.600 --> 2:37:41.720]  takeover because they know the public is so ignorant
[2:37:41.720 --> 2:37:46.040]  the public's ignorance is their strength tyranny's strength is the public's
[2:37:46.040 --> 2:37:48.920]  ignorance and it's like light in darkness as we
[2:37:48.920 --> 2:37:52.520]  become informed and understand the conspiracy and that it's an
[2:37:52.520 --> 2:37:56.360]  open conspiracy and that it's an arrogant conspiracy we can bring it
[2:37:56.360 --> 2:38:00.040]  down but we have to realize it is a criminal enterprise
[2:38:00.040 --> 2:38:04.600]  rosa quarry you've got the floor yeah well you said it alex and i don't know
[2:38:04.600 --> 2:38:09.080]  if you happen to catch kissinger henry kissinger had a little
[2:38:09.080 --> 2:38:12.280]  article on the wall street journal about a week and a half ago where he was
[2:38:12.280 --> 2:38:15.080]  talking about the assembly of the new world order
[2:38:15.080 --> 2:38:18.680]  and he was talking about you know basically that
[2:38:18.680 --> 2:38:22.520]  well we haven't we've got economic integration globally
[2:38:22.520 --> 2:38:25.720]  you know these these people are globalists we've got economic
[2:38:25.720 --> 2:38:29.240]  integration globally but we haven't gone far enough
[2:38:29.240 --> 2:38:35.560]  you know we really need you know we really need to have a full global system
[2:38:35.560 --> 2:38:40.280]  and and the framework for that is already in place with the united nations
[2:38:40.280 --> 2:38:46.040]  you know so this is the structure is to you know where you've got the
[2:38:46.040 --> 2:38:50.120]  organization of the islamic states having a you know very powerful block
[2:38:50.120 --> 2:38:54.840]  and you know talking about isis isil whatever they're calling it this week
[2:38:54.840 --> 2:38:59.800]  you know this is about um empowering fundamental
[2:38:59.800 --> 2:39:03.000]  fundamentalists who are not going to allow
[2:39:03.000 --> 2:39:06.440]  dissent and this is you know what we're talking about like you know whether
[2:39:06.440 --> 2:39:10.280]  you're going to guiana with your with jim jones or whether you're going down
[2:39:10.280 --> 2:39:14.680]  to your city council and being uh be rated by your local
[2:39:14.680 --> 2:39:18.200]  neighborhood association that's not going to allow you to speak out against
[2:39:18.200 --> 2:39:21.480]  whatever thing they're throwing at you this week in your town
[2:39:21.480 --> 2:39:25.240]  it's about not allowing dissent it's about restriction
[2:39:25.240 --> 2:39:29.480]  of thought and there are people who actually have the nerve to call themselves
[2:39:29.480 --> 2:39:34.520]  thought leaders all over the world who are mainly out of universities and so
[2:39:34.520 --> 2:39:37.240]  called think tanks who are directing the
[2:39:37.240 --> 2:39:43.880]  corporatocracy this is agenda 21 is the um it's the blueprint to
[2:39:43.880 --> 2:39:50.120]  inventory and control all aspects of your life all human activity on the
[2:39:50.120 --> 2:39:53.720]  planet and so what that means is it requires
[2:39:53.720 --> 2:39:59.000]  continual assessment and inventory monitoring assessment
[2:39:59.000 --> 2:40:02.600]  and change and this is what your school systems are about that's what common
[2:40:02.600 --> 2:40:08.440]  core is really about it's about assessment analysis inventory and then
[2:40:08.440 --> 2:40:12.600]  management of populations so this is what we're dealing with now
[2:40:12.600 --> 2:40:16.920]  is it's pervading every aspect of our of our culture
[2:40:16.920 --> 2:40:22.200]  all around the world and anything that you know that destroys your your
[2:40:22.200 --> 2:40:26.840]  existing structure is a boon to this because it's about
[2:40:26.840 --> 2:40:31.240]  throwing you completely out of your your equilibrium
[2:40:31.240 --> 2:40:35.080]  and destroying any sense that you have that you have control
[2:40:35.080 --> 2:40:38.360]  it's about destroying our independence completely
[2:40:38.360 --> 2:40:43.240]  our individual concept of ourselves as individuals who have the right
[2:40:43.240 --> 2:40:49.160]  to resist to speak out to be strong and this is why it's so important for all
[2:40:49.160 --> 2:40:52.520]  of us to educate ourselves because if you
[2:40:52.520 --> 2:40:56.920]  don't know you're looking at it you can be going right along with it
[2:40:56.920 --> 2:41:01.480]  you'd be a good german all by yourself you know put on your little uniform and
[2:41:01.480 --> 2:41:04.120]  you don't even realize that you're part of the plan
[2:41:04.120 --> 2:41:08.680]  unless you have the background and the knowledge that you need to recognize
[2:41:08.680 --> 2:41:11.160]  what it is because they don't call it United Nations
[2:41:11.160 --> 2:41:14.760]  Agenda 21 when you're looking at it in your town
[2:41:14.760 --> 2:41:18.280]  you know so it might be your your climate action plan the way your
[2:41:18.280 --> 2:41:22.280]  universities are are taking control through clusters
[2:41:22.280 --> 2:41:27.480]  through innovation ownership through direction of your mind through
[2:41:27.480 --> 2:41:31.720]  through installing sustainable development principles in every
[2:41:31.720 --> 2:41:35.480]  aspect of your schooling and it's not about we're not talking about
[2:41:35.480 --> 2:41:39.000]  recycling and stuff here we're talking about actual
[2:41:39.000 --> 2:41:42.280]  the way that you think about yourself as a human being
[2:41:42.280 --> 2:41:46.280]  that you are destroying the planet and that any action that you take
[2:41:46.280 --> 2:41:52.920]  that is individual is simply too selfish your individual concept of
[2:41:52.920 --> 2:41:58.120]  yourself is destroying the planet and you know this
[2:41:58.120 --> 2:42:02.760]  this is really the way that this plan is forwarded
[2:42:02.760 --> 2:42:07.240]  so the individual itself is evil yeah that's right
[2:42:07.240 --> 2:42:11.000]  and so you know this is part of the whole third way concept you know that
[2:42:11.000 --> 2:42:14.040]  you've seen where you know you have to it's like the Hegelian
[2:42:14.040 --> 2:42:18.040]  dialectic where you have to look at you know free will is thought crime
[2:42:18.040 --> 2:42:21.640]  right and here you are anything that you're thinking about you know that
[2:42:21.640 --> 2:42:24.440]  goes against you know that's dissenting where you say hey
[2:42:24.440 --> 2:42:28.440]  wait a second you know let me ask a question here slow down
[2:42:28.440 --> 2:42:32.280]  you know what what's the rush what are we what are we doing here let's
[2:42:32.280 --> 2:42:36.120]  ask the question how can we have a sovereign state without a border that's
[2:42:36.120 --> 2:42:38.840]  controlled how can we you know teach our
[2:42:38.840 --> 2:42:41.640]  children mathematics when they when they're being
[2:42:41.640 --> 2:42:45.240]  inserting huge numbers of steps that have nothing to do with math
[2:42:45.240 --> 2:42:49.720]  what why are you know our public officials not really representing us
[2:42:49.720 --> 2:42:53.480]  these are the questions we need to be demanding answers to
[2:42:53.480 --> 2:42:57.640]  and the thing is is that when you when you join
[2:42:57.640 --> 2:43:02.280]  as an individual with others who are asking these questions who are demanding
[2:43:02.280 --> 2:43:05.880]  the answers then you have power when you're
[2:43:05.880 --> 2:43:09.160]  cowed when you're terrified when you're freaking out
[2:43:09.160 --> 2:43:13.560]  you are not thinking clearly and this is what you know the plan is
[2:43:13.560 --> 2:43:16.760]  designed to do is to destroy your equilibrium
[2:43:16.760 --> 2:43:22.280]  to panic you and also to make you accept a situation that you never would have
[2:43:22.280 --> 2:43:25.800]  accepted if it weren't for a tremendous chaotic
[2:43:25.800 --> 2:43:31.560]  crisis and CNN says we're in a crisis the answer is
[2:43:31.560 --> 2:43:34.600]  joining the crown
[2:43:36.040 --> 2:43:39.320]  right you too you too can be part of the huge
[2:43:39.320 --> 2:43:44.200]  regional global plan you know all you have to do is just go along
[2:43:44.200 --> 2:43:48.920]  and people don't want to resist because it's too difficult and it creates a
[2:43:48.920 --> 2:43:52.520]  sense of stress in them that they might not be accepted by their friends and
[2:43:52.520 --> 2:43:55.960]  their neighbors or they might you know they might get some kind of trouble
[2:43:55.960 --> 2:43:59.560]  so but you've got to really be courageous and you know
[2:43:59.560 --> 2:44:03.880]  hey what is the point of your life anyway if you're living as a slave or as
[2:44:03.880 --> 2:44:07.560]  some directed individual it's not really your life at all
[2:44:07.560 --> 2:44:11.000]  so I think and I think that your listeners obviously
[2:44:11.000 --> 2:44:14.280]  are people who are independent thinkers who are people who are
[2:44:14.280 --> 2:44:18.520]  looking clearly looking at the reality of what's going on
[2:44:18.520 --> 2:44:24.600]  and demanding you know that you know that answers be given them and that no
[2:44:24.600 --> 2:44:29.080]  activity be taken especially military activities you know this is
[2:44:29.080 --> 2:44:33.240]  we're talking about totalitarian control that's being put in place to control
[2:44:33.240 --> 2:44:37.400]  us this is what it's about like for instance the United States Army just
[2:44:37.400 --> 2:44:41.960]  put out a report I know you know about this on mega regions on mega cities and
[2:44:41.960 --> 2:44:45.960]  how they're they're saying we're not prepared to deal with
[2:44:45.960 --> 2:44:49.240]  hand-to-hand combat in cities in mega cities
[2:44:49.240 --> 2:44:53.480]  but this is the design this is okay so let's pump up the military
[2:44:53.480 --> 2:44:57.160]  let's give them all their robotics and their you know their drones and
[2:44:57.160 --> 2:45:00.200]  everything they need to fight us in New York City
[2:45:00.200 --> 2:45:04.280]  this is the concept so you know we're at this point where we're just
[2:45:04.280 --> 2:45:08.280]  reeling and this is the purpose of it this is the
[2:45:08.280 --> 2:45:11.560]  purpose of what's going on is public-private partnerships
[2:45:11.560 --> 2:45:16.760]  fascism and total globalization to remove our ability to have representative
[2:45:16.760 --> 2:45:19.320]  government
[2:45:20.200 --> 2:45:23.720]  continue breaking it down hey you know this is it
[2:45:23.720 --> 2:45:28.200]  and your university is part of it your you know your school system your local
[2:45:28.200 --> 2:45:32.120]  school system your local nonprofit your local
[2:45:32.120 --> 2:45:35.880]  neighborhood association you know you get invited to
[2:45:35.880 --> 2:45:41.880]  you know to go comment on you know horizon 2035 or whatever it is in your
[2:45:41.880 --> 2:45:45.480]  local town you know new york 2040 you know
[2:45:45.480 --> 2:45:50.200]  whatever the plans are northeast landscapes the byways that you know
[2:45:50.200 --> 2:45:54.840]  whatever the plans are the greenways the blueways these are all about
[2:45:54.840 --> 2:45:58.920]  inventorying and controlling your activity on the planet
[2:45:58.920 --> 2:46:03.640]  and about restricting your ability to get out into the rural and suburban
[2:46:03.640 --> 2:46:07.000]  areas and live freely if you want to live in the cities that's
[2:46:07.000 --> 2:46:10.680]  fine but your taxes are actually paying to construct
[2:46:10.680 --> 2:46:16.680]  nonprofit and for-profit low income and regular income
[2:46:16.680 --> 2:46:20.600]  buildings that are inside of your city center so that you will get in
[2:46:20.600 --> 2:46:25.240]  out of the rural and suburban areas on your so-called high speed rail that goes
[2:46:25.240 --> 2:46:29.560]  nowhere doesn't exist since your economy keeps you trapped
[2:46:29.560 --> 2:46:35.080]  in the center of a mega city region where now your military is going to be
[2:46:35.080 --> 2:46:41.080]  patrolling with drones and this is about control it's about literally about the
[2:46:41.080 --> 2:46:46.200]  blueprint for control of us all across the world
[2:46:46.200 --> 2:46:50.120]  so whatever your system is you need to ask whether it's local and your
[2:46:50.120 --> 2:46:53.800]  businesses and your schools you need to step back and say
[2:46:53.800 --> 2:46:58.280]  who is heading this up who is funding them
[2:46:58.280 --> 2:47:02.440]  is it the Rockefeller Foundation the Ford Foundation are they the private
[2:47:02.440 --> 2:47:05.800]  groups are they is it the EPA the department of
[2:47:05.800 --> 2:47:10.040]  transportation the HUD you know which agencies are
[2:47:10.040 --> 2:47:13.640]  paying for this they were all on the president's council on sustainable
[2:47:13.640 --> 2:47:19.000]  development this is a federal plan moving towards a full
[2:47:19.000 --> 2:47:24.680]  global plan this is the goal so we need to remove the blinders that we have
[2:47:24.680 --> 2:47:28.760]  stop being panic and start taking our power together
[2:47:28.760 --> 2:47:32.120]  educating ourselves is the most powerful thing that we can do
[2:47:32.120 --> 2:47:35.880]  because if you don't know what what the enemy looks like
[2:47:35.880 --> 2:47:40.280]  you're very likely to be going and volunteering your time
[2:47:40.280 --> 2:47:45.000]  for those groups the groups that are working against you
[2:47:45.640 --> 2:47:48.760]  and this is not something that can't be defeated
[2:47:48.760 --> 2:47:52.840]  once you educate the public once we expose the criminal conspiracy
[2:47:52.840 --> 2:47:56.600]  once people understand that when you're said they're talking to a major mayor
[2:47:56.600 --> 2:47:59.960]  like the mayor of Austin who is an agenda 21 model
[2:47:59.960 --> 2:48:05.800]  UN certified operative Austin is a model of their global takeover
[2:48:05.800 --> 2:48:10.360]  they all know full well it's a zoning tax takeover and not about a nice city
[2:48:10.360 --> 2:48:13.800]  they all know it's about insiders getting waivers and nobody else getting it
[2:48:13.800 --> 2:48:18.520]  they're sitting up there literally as organized crime and i'll say it
[2:48:18.520 --> 2:48:21.960]  knowing what they're doing with techniques and seminars
[2:48:21.960 --> 2:48:26.760]  they've gone to for decades to know how to make you feel small to laugh at you
[2:48:26.760 --> 2:48:31.240]  Lee laughing well flips off people that are there talking about agenda 21 we have
[2:48:31.240 --> 2:48:34.520]  video to make you feel desperate and powerless
[2:48:34.520 --> 2:48:38.120]  and to try to end citizens communication because the truth is
[2:48:38.120 --> 2:48:41.960]  they know that they've basically hijacked the city
[2:48:41.960 --> 2:48:46.360]  as a microcosm they know like bank robbers going into a bank
[2:48:46.360 --> 2:48:49.160]  and we're like going hey this isn't nice what you're doing it's really a
[2:48:49.160 --> 2:48:53.000]  haha nobody's robbing a bank keep them in the back tied up
[2:48:53.000 --> 2:48:56.520]  go on little kid get on out of the way they're conscious
[2:48:56.520 --> 2:49:01.400]  we're dealing with perps here this is a giant corporate organized crime
[2:49:01.400 --> 2:49:04.840]  uh cult it's a military operation
[2:49:04.840 --> 2:49:08.040]  yeah and this is you know this is the concept you know this is what you're
[2:49:08.040 --> 2:49:11.880]  talking about cults fundamentalism uh you know does not
[2:49:11.880 --> 2:49:15.640]  allow for any thinking outside of what is permitted
[2:49:15.640 --> 2:49:18.920]  and so you know this is what's so frightening i would say if you're going
[2:49:18.920 --> 2:49:22.920]  to talk about fear um about having uh you know
[2:49:22.920 --> 2:49:26.600]  infiltration in your government or your government participating with
[2:49:26.600 --> 2:49:31.080]  restricting uh you know you're the way of the way that you think or the way that
[2:49:31.080 --> 2:49:35.880]  your ability to express yourself is uh is allowed
[2:49:35.880 --> 2:49:38.360]  you know simply when you go to a public meeting
[2:49:38.360 --> 2:49:41.800]  you know in fact i just came from i was just in alaska
[2:49:41.800 --> 2:49:46.120]  and i was in kodiak alaska and their city council up there
[2:49:46.120 --> 2:49:51.080]  their borough council just said hey you know uh we have decorum rules so we
[2:49:51.080 --> 2:49:54.920]  don't want you questioning the motives of anyone sitting on this
[2:49:54.920 --> 2:49:58.600]  council that's not decorum rules that's that's show the style
[2:49:58.600 --> 2:50:02.200]  speech control hey this council is being paid off here's the evidence
[2:50:02.200 --> 2:50:05.400]  officer arrest that woman i see these videos all the time
[2:50:05.400 --> 2:50:08.600]  you don't come in here and say this is part of a un plan but you've got a un
[2:50:08.600 --> 2:50:11.720]  certified board member you're implementing it you're getting the grant
[2:50:11.720 --> 2:50:16.440]  under the treaty officer take that man out of here and we see the videos
[2:50:16.440 --> 2:50:19.320]  you stand up and say i don't want my daughter taught
[2:50:19.320 --> 2:50:22.680]  two plus two equals six i don't want fuzzy math
[2:50:22.680 --> 2:50:26.440]  officer take that man out of the pta and he's like i had my three minutes
[2:50:26.440 --> 2:50:31.000]  i don't like your tone officer arrest that man and the officer does it
[2:50:31.000 --> 2:50:34.840]  again it just it it because it is a criminal
[2:50:34.840 --> 2:50:40.040]  cult takeover of collectivist that don't build or make something
[2:50:40.040 --> 2:50:45.320]  they go and organize things set up fraud work together in robus and i used to
[2:50:45.320 --> 2:50:47.640]  think it was only the top one percent of the elite
[2:50:47.640 --> 2:50:51.320]  that knew the whole picture it's gotten so bad now with their training
[2:50:51.320 --> 2:50:54.920]  they all sit around and just laugh at their own events about us

[2:55:58.360 --> 2:56:01.400]  i know in austin all over they're building city funded
[2:56:01.400 --> 2:56:06.040]  200 square foot coffin apartments and then and then taxing people that have
[2:56:06.040 --> 2:56:09.240]  good size apartments before social engineering
[2:56:09.240 --> 2:56:12.600]  uh they are opening the borders up to drop down wages

[2:56:17.160 --> 2:56:20.520]  talking about is treason this is organized crime
[2:56:20.520 --> 2:56:24.600]  and the the shock is that of course it's organized by your own government
[2:56:24.600 --> 2:56:28.440]  it is a takeover this is not you're not going to see the tanks rolling down
[2:56:28.440 --> 2:56:30.840]  your street right away anything like that
[2:56:30.840 --> 2:56:33.480]  this is what it looks like when you get taken over
[2:56:33.480 --> 2:56:38.360]  and um you know the way to block it to stop it i don't know how much we can
[2:56:38.360 --> 2:56:41.640]  stop it if we don't join together and really become aware
[2:56:41.640 --> 2:56:45.240]  but you can anti-delphi meetings you can get the information
[2:56:45.240 --> 2:56:48.120]  out to your elected officials who you have elected
[2:56:48.120 --> 2:56:51.240]  you know what the thing is with your elected officials they don't always
[2:56:51.240 --> 2:56:55.160]  have to agree with you but if you show up down there with 200 people
[2:56:55.160 --> 2:56:58.440]  they're going to block whatever it is that they were going to do
[2:56:58.440 --> 2:57:02.760]  to you they will they will stop doing it because they want to stay in office
[2:57:02.760 --> 2:57:05.800]  and this is the only power that we have at this point
[2:57:05.800 --> 2:57:10.120]  is to you know we've got our legal power we are suing to stop a huge regional
[2:57:10.120 --> 2:57:15.320]  plan here in the san francisco bay area um that's our agenda 21 major
[2:57:15.320 --> 2:57:18.840]  regionalization plan uh you can do things like this too
[2:57:18.840 --> 2:57:23.000]  you go down you you uh you speak out you elect
[2:57:23.000 --> 2:57:27.000]  people who represent you you don't listen to controlled opposition you
[2:57:27.000 --> 2:57:31.560]  are the resistance you don't allow people to put words in your mouth or
[2:57:31.560 --> 2:57:35.080]  manipulate your children you expose these collaborators
[2:57:35.080 --> 2:57:39.320]  and this is something that you know if we this is where
[2:57:39.320 --> 2:57:43.800]  the rubber meets the road with mega regions with regionalization
[2:57:43.800 --> 2:57:47.800]  because that is the stepping stone as the big new brazinski said
[2:57:47.800 --> 2:57:52.040]  to full globalization so when you're in your town and you see these
[2:57:52.040 --> 2:57:55.880]  mega buildings getting built you know they're supposed to be so fabulous
[2:57:55.880 --> 2:58:00.200]  and groovy and have the coffee shop downstairs and your bus laying out in
[2:58:00.200 --> 2:58:03.080]  front and all your bikes and all that this is about
[2:58:03.080 --> 2:58:08.200]  concentration of populations it's about making it more crowded more
[2:58:08.200 --> 2:58:11.560]  hellish yeah just literally micromanaging
[2:58:11.560 --> 2:58:15.000]  surveilling everything we do that's an agenda 21
[2:58:15.000 --> 2:58:20.120]  total surveillance either resistance we can do it
