[00:00.000 --> 00:13.760]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex
[00:13.760 --> 00:38.200]  Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones welcome my friends
[00:38.200 --> 00:47.880]  welcome it is Thursday the ninth day of February 2012 and we are going to be live here for
[00:47.880 --> 00:54.920]  the next three hours Lord willing and Russia is threatening military intervention if the
[00:54.920 --> 01:02.760]  proxy armies out of the United States Israel England France and others continue to try
[01:02.760 --> 01:13.520]  to overthrow the Assad regime and it's not that I'm a fan of Assad but the globalists
[01:13.520 --> 01:19.840]  are not trying to bring freedom to that country and that would be dangerous enough and not
[01:19.840 --> 01:26.640]  constitutional and not our job they want to put jihadist Wahhabist Saudi Arabian al-Qaeda
[01:26.640 --> 01:33.960]  on record I mean it's in the news today another Reuters article a LA Times article I got a
[01:33.960 --> 01:42.560]  bunch of them where they admit it's al-Qaeda and the FAA is announcing 30,000 drones including
[01:42.560 --> 01:48.880]  weaponized drones over the American people and then I was on a Florida station 810 that
[01:48.880 --> 01:53.920]  were on there in Orlando or were number one again new ratings just came out it's happening
[01:53.920 --> 02:00.280]  a lot of stations now go from not even really showing up in that demographic number one
[02:00.280 --> 02:04.920]  but people are hungry for the truth and they were telling me that local news is saying
[02:04.920 --> 02:09.160]  oh yeah Homeland Security is going to have four drones to give you the traffic reports
[02:09.160 --> 02:14.240]  yeah I can't use the cameras that the feds put in that we're going to be for traffic
[02:14.240 --> 02:20.200]  that are hooked in everybody can see that all the newsrooms have I can't have a news chopper
[02:20.200 --> 02:24.400]  no no no Homeland Security wants you to see the traffic and of course they will give you
[02:24.400 --> 02:28.840]  feeds to acclimate you know it is the traffic but it's just to condition you to accept it
[02:28.840 --> 02:34.600]  our money being used and being turned against us it's a very elementary and now it's all
[02:34.600 --> 02:45.280]  out in the open it's now all out in the open it's not debatable they say yes we're going
[02:45.280 --> 02:50.440]  to use the military against you yes we'll kill citizens yes we'll secretly arrest you
[02:50.440 --> 02:58.360]  yes we'll use drones and by the way Washington Post LA Times again you can just type in
[02:58.360 --> 03:07.520]  drones now autonomous all of these major drone systems the predators reapers you name it
[03:07.520 --> 03:13.880]  the humans are controlling them from distance with satellites and other systems but the
[03:13.880 --> 03:17.760]  computers are watching and learning and now the computers are already flying better than
[03:17.760 --> 03:22.960]  the humans and they're even targeting and killing that's why the globalists are going
[03:22.960 --> 03:29.400]  to a robot army though that is a robot that is an autonomous AI robot a propeller driven
[03:29.400 --> 03:38.960]  or jet aircraft flying around 10,000 miles away killing people on its own is an AI hunter
[03:38.960 --> 03:46.840]  killer Skynet system and again I happen to see articles written by the original writer
[03:46.840 --> 03:53.480]  of the terminator they got all that from Pentagon future plans written in the 1970s where they
[03:53.480 --> 03:59.160]  call it a control grid on the ground and guess what they call it it's public you just type
[03:59.160 --> 04:05.920]  Pentagon documents Skynet it's I put a copy of it in my book to send a journey with the
[04:05.920 --> 04:11.000]  satellites and the drones and the ground robots guess what the Pentagon calls the global system
[04:11.000 --> 04:17.920]  they call the internet an internet a worldwide web guess what they call the airborne system
[04:17.920 --> 04:30.600]  Skynet yes Skynet Skynet see it's not the Pentagon imitating art it's art imitating
[04:30.600 --> 04:40.240]  the Pentagon Skynet Skynet and you pay for Skynet and again you're not going to have
[04:40.240 --> 04:46.040]  if they get their way you're not going to even have the average cop is going to be disarmed
[04:46.040 --> 04:51.360]  only having a taser and a robot 18 wheeler is going to pull up and robots are going to
[04:51.360 --> 04:56.160]  get out of the back and that's who's going to come in your house and kill you as if we're

[09:09.000 --> 09:13.640]  that gary francey is insane it needs to be on medication in the article they actually
[09:13.640 --> 09:19.160]  say that because because gary francey believes in a world government gee i just saw a un
[09:19.160 --> 09:23.920]  press release calling for global government and global taxes and it was in us newspapers
[09:23.920 --> 09:30.960]  on friday i've just got literally more than 50 world leaders prime ministers presidents

[10:03.120 --> 10:08.000]  drones over us the next 10 years and i was on a radio talk show this morning and while
[10:08.000 --> 10:12.760]  they were telling me about how local news is saying the drones are going to be for traffic
[10:12.760 --> 10:17.320]  to monitor traffic i went and searched what they said and sure enough all over the country
[10:17.320 --> 10:23.000]  for the sheep they're announcing yes pentagon drones and local police drones to monitor
[10:23.000 --> 10:27.720]  traffic just like the cameras you know 15 years ago were put up under homeland security
[10:27.720 --> 10:32.680]  before that was even publicly announced under the federal auspices of traffic we're going
[10:32.680 --> 10:37.280]  to monitor traffic they always they always have some little you know you touchy feely
[10:37.280 --> 10:46.640]  excuse for the pentagon setting up this total control grid but now it's all admitted using
[10:46.640 --> 10:54.400]  the military against the american people having us disappear into black holes it's all happening
[10:54.400 --> 11:00.880]  it's all happening like a bad nightmare and i've got stacks of news today i know you're
[11:00.880 --> 11:05.080]  seeing it on your news it's everywhere they're going yeah in europe england us they're going
[11:05.080 --> 11:09.960]  to start censoring speech you know it's just the thing to do and you don't have any privacy
[11:09.960 --> 11:18.400]  on the web and businesses everywhere are getting these fbi flyers that are on the fbi website
[11:18.400 --> 11:24.320]  where every business you can imagine is being called are people paying cash are people surfing
[11:24.320 --> 11:31.760]  the internet using aol or comcast it actually says in this fbi flyer in fact guys will you
[11:31.760 --> 11:35.240]  get me that copy they had on the nightly news last night when mike adams did they took my
[11:35.240 --> 11:40.160]  big stack of 30 plus flyers and and and because people won't believe this i've got a i've got
[11:40.160 --> 11:46.200]  a read from it where it says are they using comcast or aol that could be a proxy go ahead
[11:46.200 --> 11:50.440]  and call fbi get their license plate but don't let them know you're watching them they could
[11:50.440 --> 11:56.360]  be dangerous what and again it's like do they have a cell phone do they have blue jeans
[11:56.360 --> 12:01.540]  it actually says that in the flyers are they missing a finger do they have an american flag
[12:01.540 --> 12:06.120]  tattoo you're like well that's ridiculous that's everybody that's the point it's about
[12:06.120 --> 12:12.560]  a total culture of paranoia only trusting the skynet drones and the tsa checkpoints on
[12:12.560 --> 12:17.680]  highways and people groping your wife they're the threat the founding fathers shed it be

[13:21.080 --> 13:26.600]  a call i meant to tell you that and it it it it it goes into the article freaking out
[13:26.600 --> 13:36.680]  and links to an interview he did with me where he talked about how when he was a teenager
[13:36.680 --> 13:42.320]  and was listening to this show as he's a bit younger than i am so he was listening when
[13:42.320 --> 13:52.000]  i was like 25 and he was uh you know like 18 or something that his parents thought he
[13:52.000 --> 13:59.480]  was insane and put him on drugs and they use that clip and say see he's crazy no no this

[14:04.840 --> 14:10.080]  and the you know gary's quoted as saying i was worried about a new world order a casual
[14:10.080 --> 14:16.600]  society a banking takeover all of it's happening and so my parents drugged me so they use that
[14:16.600 --> 14:21.960]  quote to make it sound like he's crazy no what's crazy is that he was drugged because
[14:21.960 --> 14:28.400]  he was aware of this so they're implying i mean it's just amazing the the level of yellow
[14:28.400 --> 14:35.360]  journalism in the mouse that roared now you know it's incredible we've got an info wars

[24:05.440 --> 24:14.600]  We have a couple sources who have worked inside of a FEMA camp training center and they now
[24:14.600 --> 24:19.800]  admit they've trained the military for domestic operations of course and civilian inmate labor
[24:19.800 --> 24:28.200]  camp operators and of course that's that's even been in the wall street journal now but
[24:28.200 --> 24:32.000]  they've really increased the security they bug their eyes out at everyone that comes
[24:32.000 --> 24:38.320]  into the camp to do work and it's just all part of this delusion by the criminals and
[24:38.320 --> 24:45.600]  by the camp workers that everyone is a terrorist it's this crazed delusion that terrorists
[24:45.600 --> 24:51.720]  are under every table and you can't trust the public and that delusion has been given
[24:51.720 --> 24:56.640]  to you because you're actually the bad guys but that's how it works in history you got
[24:56.640 --> 25:01.480]  to know Nazis when their camps were clandestine and in the late 30s before they started becoming
[25:01.480 --> 25:06.840]  public you know we're walking around bugging their eyes at locals that were you know mowing
[25:06.840 --> 25:14.080]  their yard next to the camp or driving by or working on base and we've got the name
[25:14.080 --> 25:18.720]  of the base a lot of Intel I talked to the guy late last night I've talked to him before
[25:18.720 --> 25:22.840]  I checked it with his sources I have another source there and then I kind of just sent
[25:22.840 --> 25:27.280]  an email to a curtain MO who did an article this morning on it and that's up at info wars
[25:27.280 --> 25:33.360]  dot com with some of the photos we're going to get some more photos but you're not sure
[25:33.360 --> 25:39.920]  about us posting them all because they might identify who they are so we didn't they're
[25:39.920 --> 25:45.960]  going to send us more that they're sure of that we can show but that article is up on
[25:45.960 --> 25:56.520]  info wars dot com right now source exposes FEMA training camp in Missouri so disgusting
[25:56.520 --> 26:02.600]  and he talks about foreign troops on the base that are training the MPs for riot control
[26:02.600 --> 26:07.720]  and cracking Americans heads with batons and they've got what he believes is a rendition
[26:07.720 --> 26:14.440]  torture room they've got facilities to put people in the hole there and you can see the
[26:14.440 --> 26:19.520]  little little buildings where they have the individual cells that have barbed wire around
[26:19.520 --> 26:24.320]  them individually if you blow that photo up right there you see there's barbed wire facing
[26:24.320 --> 26:29.200]  both directions on the outside and then barbed wire fit fences facing both directions around
[26:29.200 --> 26:35.880]  each little building and it's a sprawling compound these guys kind of got shook up after
[26:35.880 --> 26:39.600]  I can't even tell the whole story in fact I can't even tell you everything they saw
[26:39.600 --> 26:45.080]  because it would give away who they are it's bad though man this country said so much trouble
[26:45.080 --> 26:49.800]  all you people that have been living in denial out there you're going to wake up later the
[26:49.800 --> 27:02.680]  only question is will it be too late it's so sick 30,000 most of them armed drones
[27:02.680 --> 27:06.240]  fox news was shown a few years ago it's like a flying saucer it's got a big turbine in
[27:06.240 --> 27:11.560]  it some number about 10 feet wide some about four feet and it's got these taser cannons
[27:11.560 --> 27:17.480]  they shoot at people it's like the taser shotgun but it shoots shoots you know there's not wires
[27:17.480 --> 27:23.280]  attached to it it's a self-contained shocker and this drone flies up and and face scans
[27:23.280 --> 27:29.080]  you and then shouts orders at you to get down on the ground and then if you don't it fires
[27:29.080 --> 27:37.080]  shotgun tasers at you and it also shows them firing gas at people tear gas and of course
[27:37.080 --> 27:42.520]  that's just to get you ready first it'll be that it'll be weaponized drones and for some
[27:42.520 --> 27:48.120]  reason they they think the public will accept robots in the sky because it's not the archetypal
[27:48.120 --> 27:53.200]  robot on its feet but the treaded and the leg robots they've also got robots that look
[27:53.200 --> 28:02.760]  like dogs without heads that are gas-powered just just type in ground robots and or combat
[28:02.760 --> 28:07.560]  robots and you'll see them there's hundreds of them they've shown the public and of course
[28:07.560 --> 28:11.720]  that stuff's 20 30 years old the classified stuff that I've been told about by multiple
[28:11.720 --> 28:17.800]  sources is just nightmarish and and mainly they're just big wheeled robots with guns
[28:17.800 --> 28:23.560]  all over them and hang grenade launchers and imagine again already in a whole bunch of
[28:23.560 --> 28:28.720]  states they got robot 18 wheelers robot cars on the roads with no humans on board but what
[28:28.720 --> 28:32.840]  I was told about 10 years ago by some Marines that I later confirmed or it's now 12 years
[28:32.840 --> 28:40.600]  ago time flies was they've got 18 wheelers or big treaded tanks that have a whole bunch
[28:40.600 --> 28:46.240]  of robots stacked up inside of them and it just pulls up ramp goes down off rolls the
[28:46.240 --> 28:51.600]  robots or off walks the robots and it's party time but the really little nasty little buggers
[28:51.600 --> 28:57.440]  they've got again are like spiders or treaded ones too and they're and they're small and
[28:57.440 --> 29:02.600]  they'll have one go up it's basically a hanger named with legs it walks up to your front
[29:02.600 --> 29:07.200]  door blows the door up and then another one comes up behind it and goes in with a camera
[29:07.200 --> 29:13.280]  on it or they can be autonomous and just kill any life form they come in contact with and
[29:13.280 --> 29:21.880]  then the little robot just comes in and kills you and it's all your tax money and they're
[29:21.880 --> 29:26.040]  putting cancer viruses in your vaccines and fluoride in your water I mean we are living
[29:26.040 --> 29:34.620]  in a science fiction crazy land 25 years ago they had robot rat cyborgs with brain ships
[29:34.620 --> 29:40.160]  that can carry explosives into your house oh yeah you didn't know about robo bomb rats
[29:40.160 --> 29:44.840]  just search it you'll pull it up they've got roaches 20 plus years ago with a microchip
[29:44.840 --> 29:52.120]  on the head and a tiny wireless camera 25 years ago we're on the march the empires on
[29:52.120 --> 30:02.520]  the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the

[34:02.100 --> 34:07.260]  doing to me and knowing what they're doing to you and then seeing the unconscious population
[34:07.260 --> 34:12.300]  starting to wake up a little but still going well he's right about some stuff but he's
[34:12.300 --> 34:19.060]  he's a cook no I'm not a cook okay I'm a red-blooded human being I'm an American but I'm a human
[34:19.060 --> 34:24.260]  being first and my country's under attack and I'm sick of it and let me tell you Time

[34:29.940 --> 34:36.140]  get rid of it they are treasonous traders and I know they're globalist guys will you
[34:36.140 --> 34:41.660]  print me the Cicero quote on the trader Cicero quote on the trader traders are the plague
[34:41.660 --> 34:46.260]  I want to read that quote or you put it on screen traders are the plague and if these
[34:46.260 --> 34:52.540]  people aren't traders then I don't know what they are if these people aren't traders then
[34:52.540 --> 34:59.540]  nobody is I mean it is disgusting and because they got all a bunch of fancy flim flam media
[34:59.540 --> 35:04.300]  with a bunch of fancy teleprompters and ten million dollar sets there's still some people
[35:04.300 --> 35:09.940]  that sit there watching this scum who practices acting real official and real authoritative
[35:09.940 --> 35:14.820]  and their appeal to authority the media analyst and all the rest of them in the so-called
[35:14.820 --> 35:21.260]  mainstream media who are a pack of crooks and because they have almost no viewers now
[35:21.260 --> 35:24.780]  because they have no credibility because they know you're starting to wake up to them they're
[35:24.780 --> 35:32.780]  now racing to start giant wars they're now racing to start giant wars because they know
[35:32.780 --> 35:39.780]  in a war you will shut up and go along with the police state in history war is the health
[35:39.780 --> 35:45.460]  of the authoritarian state we read you those breakdowns of that famous quote yesterday
[35:45.460 --> 35:49.780]  all right let me just do this why I get so hot I get in here I study the news and then
[35:49.780 --> 35:56.980]  I go on air and by the time I've gone over all this news I'm hotter than a pistol I mean
[35:56.980 --> 36:04.500]  where to start this is just so insane look at this headline in MSNBC okay reported by
[36:04.500 --> 36:13.780]  the Associated Press AP article posted in MSNBC now here's another MSNBC article attacking
[36:13.780 --> 36:20.620]  myself and Gary Franchi because we believe Al Qaeda is run by globalist we're bad men
[36:20.620 --> 36:24.740]  we're crazy we're evil we believe a global government's being founded by mega banks which
[36:24.740 --> 36:30.060]  is publicly happening on the world stage headlines you're up getting rid of all sovereignty transferring
[36:30.060 --> 36:36.540]  to private banks giant taxes raise people going homeless thousands of children a day
[36:36.540 --> 36:42.940]  being handed over to the state because the parents are starving in Greece alone just mega
[36:42.940 --> 36:50.260]  banks appointing the new prime ministers and presidents of Greece and Italy and other places
[36:50.260 --> 36:54.340]  everything we said happening exactly as we said with them announcing world government
[36:54.340 --> 37:00.780]  and they write an article in NBC saying we're insane that's because they have nothing but
[37:00.780 --> 37:07.980]  total hatred and contempt for you and your family they think you are a moron idiot and
[37:07.980 --> 37:13.500]  obviously you're not a moron idiot I mean local radio shows have more viewers than MSNBC
[37:13.500 --> 37:19.940]  I mean they're nothing but but again they still put this big front on with their Janet
[37:19.940 --> 37:26.940]  Napolitano Mr. Mathau all those people they got on there it's a joke Fox News a joke all
[37:26.940 --> 37:34.700]  of it you know I have somebody telling me oh I got a new Fox show and I want you know

[37:39.900 --> 37:46.940]  want to be part of it I just you people the whole thing is just a joke it's all a big
[37:46.940 --> 37:53.140]  joke it's all a big fraud all a big scam and and I know where this road leads I mean it
[37:53.140 --> 38:00.900]  leads into Nazi Germany type stuff Soviet Russia Pol Pot Cameroon Cambodia type stuff
[38:00.900 --> 38:07.420]  I mean it leads into the nastiest stinking technocratic Hades I can imagine and then
[38:07.420 --> 38:13.740]  some and it's just going to get crazier and sicker and the poverty and the police state
[38:13.740 --> 38:19.820]  and the secret police and all of the garbage and all the totes and all the control freaks
[38:19.820 --> 38:25.660]  give an unlimited power to run rough shot over us it's so humiliating and it's painful
[38:25.660 --> 38:30.860]  to watch our country and the world and all systems of freedom having its throat slit
[38:30.860 --> 38:36.020]  and butchered it's like watching a beautiful woman the most beautiful woman you can imagine
[38:36.020 --> 38:40.300]  having hundreds of cigarettes put out on her and then her lips cut off and her eyelids
[38:40.300 --> 38:45.300]  cut off and then her guts hacked out of her that's what it's like it makes me sick and
[38:45.300 --> 38:51.300]  I watch all these so-called men I see everywhere a bunch of soft pathetic want to be tough guys
[38:51.300 --> 38:58.260]  who make me want to throw up you scum excuse me the point is you're in you're in trances
[38:58.260 --> 39:02.540]  and you're in comas and that's your problem I shouldn't be angry at you I was once in
[39:02.540 --> 39:07.300]  a coma as well just now it's so obvious how could you not be awake and even those of
[39:07.300 --> 39:11.620]  you that are awake some of you say well what can we do or oh they'll get me if I speak
[39:11.620 --> 39:16.540]  out they're going to get you if you don't speak out you figured that out yet the scum
[39:16.540 --> 39:21.580]  is training us to accept their evil they're trying to corrupt everyone along to their
[39:21.580 --> 39:27.580]  system to accept it all right let me just read you the headlines do I have any discipline
[39:27.580 --> 39:34.780]  can I ever do this probably not Israel teams up with terror group to kill Iran's nuclear
[39:34.780 --> 39:42.700]  scientist US official tells NBC news five years after I told you this when it was on
[39:42.700 --> 39:47.900]  the front page of the White House website and got no coverage five years after I told
[39:47.900 --> 39:54.100]  you that it's al-Qaeda and they admit that they just throw it in your face and still
[39:54.100 --> 40:02.620]  have the same publication say Franchi and Irons saying for pointing this out same publication
[40:02.620 --> 40:07.100]  we're insane for being right they're mad at us for knowing what we're talking about they're
[40:07.100 --> 40:13.380]  mad at us and then right next to it right next to it they're admitting what we said
[40:13.380 --> 40:20.100]  is true this is what the system does this is what they think of us this is what they
[40:20.100 --> 40:27.860]  think of you Israel teams with terror group to kill Iran's nuclear scientist US official
[40:27.860 --> 40:35.820]  tells NBC news there's no one super PAC supporting Ron Paul is operated by 911 truth hey hey
[40:35.820 --> 40:43.300]  NBC Harats and Jerusalem post and UPI have all reported for at least a decade that Hamas
[40:43.300 --> 40:49.860]  was founded by Israel and that Israel quote runs fake al-Qaeda groups who they have bomb
[40:49.860 --> 40:55.260]  Israelis every time they want to take Israeli's rights does that mean there aren't real suicide
[40:55.260 --> 41:00.460]  bombers or a woman that goes on a bus and stabs 15 people no that goes on the point is most
[41:00.460 --> 41:06.220]  of these big events are stays I mean it's in the Israeli newspaper you're like oh you anti-Israel
[41:06.220 --> 41:11.860]  scum is Harats anti-Israel I mean if I walk outside the skies blue you're like you're
[41:11.860 --> 41:16.540]  against red you say it's blue I'm like well the sky's blue right now it's daytime blue
[41:16.540 --> 41:21.780]  blue you're pretty weird man I get angry and I go it's blue don't tell me it's red shut
[41:21.780 --> 41:26.820]  up conspiracy theorist I mean this mind game doesn't work on me doesn't work on you now
[41:26.820 --> 41:31.780]  again notice though they're saying Israel works with the when you read deeper the al-Qaeda
[41:31.780 --> 41:39.100]  terror group Israel England all of its run by the same new world order system and they
[41:39.100 --> 41:45.140]  created al-Qaeda the Pentagon's a big to Brzezinski created and used them against the Russians
[41:45.140 --> 41:52.020]  the Serbs against Gaddafi now against Syria I mean it's in the news that jihadis al-Qaeda
[41:52.020 --> 41:57.140]  and others are being brought in by the West on three fronts to attack the Syrian regime
[41:57.140 --> 42:05.540]  and and and again remember eight nine months ago when they were launching the war on Libya
[42:05.540 --> 42:08.980]  I told you where it would go and they even talked to you like you were a child and said
[42:08.980 --> 42:13.020]  this is not a war this is a kinetic action and we don't need congressional approval
[42:13.020 --> 42:19.620]  we have you in approval more treason do words still mean things yes they do I said treason
[42:19.620 --> 42:25.700]  real treason and Hillary at the time said we promised they'll never be anything military
[42:25.700 --> 42:30.820]  in Syria while they were funding these groups that are now got street battles going on all
[42:30.820 --> 42:35.540]  over the country and it's being reported and there's links to this they're now we told
[42:35.540 --> 42:40.900]  us this weeks ago now it's been reported oh there are Western NATO Israeli and other Arab
[42:40.900 --> 42:46.420]  state commandos in there and US troops right on the border arming and advising so they're
[42:46.420 --> 42:55.260]  attacking Syria through al-Qaeda proxies out of Saudi Arabia and now what we told you weeks
[42:55.260 --> 43:06.900]  ago is being admitted now it's being admitted Iran has sent in 15,000 of the special forces
[43:06.900 --> 43:10.780]  and the Russians have said they've got a military base there they've got a naval base they're
[43:10.780 --> 43:14.980]  putting spit snaps into the country they've been there and now it's going to be US troops
[43:14.980 --> 43:21.260]  fighting Russians I mean this is this is how this stuff escalates and you've got a bucket
[43:21.260 --> 43:28.820]  of cowardly trash like Hillary Clinton running all of this I mean they already tried to cause
[43:28.820 --> 43:35.780]  war with Russia on 888 and they have neo-congribs put articles out saying Jones must be a Russian
[43:35.780 --> 43:42.740]  spy that he doesn't want to have war with Russia how about I'm not a lunatic they're
[43:42.740 --> 43:47.540]  like we're patriotic Jones doesn't like America now I don't like the foreign banks that already
[43:47.540 --> 43:52.300]  conquered my country if there were Russian banks over here doing it you bet I'd be bashing
[43:52.300 --> 44:02.580]  Russians 24 7 the Russians are all surrounded being attacked by proxy wars and it's not
[44:02.580 --> 44:11.760]  even America attacking the Russians it's the bankers doing it the bankers the bankers they
[44:11.760 --> 44:16.180]  play us all off against each other I'm sick of it they're the ones taking my liberties
[44:16.180 --> 44:19.900]  they're the ones fighting the think tanks to write the laws they're the ones going after
[44:19.900 --> 44:24.780]  my republic they're the ones pushing torture and war they're the ones using my tax money
[44:24.780 --> 44:30.580]  and then having subsidiaries that make money off the drones they're the ones given the
[44:30.580 --> 44:36.700]  big grants to colleges to shift all the big scholarships into domestic spying and the
[44:36.700 --> 44:41.660]  rest of it and changing our culture from a industrial agrarian culture to a service
[44:41.660 --> 44:46.340]  culture and now into a prison culture they're the ones that have converted us to six million
[44:46.340 --> 44:51.460]  in prison world record they're the ones they're the criminals they're the scum they're the
[44:51.460 --> 44:56.460]  trash they're the outlander they're the foreigners they're the globalists that for reads our
[44:56.460 --> 45:02.140]  call us scum up there on CNN some foreigner Bilderberg trash called for world government
[45:02.140 --> 45:07.100]  batten out of the Constitution every week some foreign traders scum on New World Order
[45:07.100 --> 45:13.580]  CNN trash started by Ted Turner a eugenicist that talks about killing 90% of the population
[45:13.580 --> 45:20.060]  they're a bunch of sick crooks and they just perch up there all day like they're the officials
[45:20.060 --> 45:38.740]  they're the authorities they've got all the answers look at this us and Israel split on
[45:38.740 --> 45:44.540]  speed of Iran threat but they agree there's this threat so they got to be attacked here's
[45:44.540 --> 45:51.820]  another one Russia's Putin warns against outside interference they're foreign minister he says
[45:51.820 --> 45:57.220]  that the West is now a cult of violence using Muslim extremists in al-Qaeda to take over
[45:57.220 --> 46:03.740]  Libya Syria I mean it's true and you're like well you don't like the West using al-Qaeda
[46:03.740 --> 46:11.980]  you love Putin oh yeah yeah big big fan of that again it's a bunch of traders masquerading
[46:11.980 --> 46:16.700]  around like they're Americans they're a bunch of terrorists that run the Muslim extremist
[46:16.700 --> 46:21.420]  that's who all these Pentagon brass are all these think tanks scum these are terrorist
[46:21.420 --> 46:26.660]  folks they all know they all met dinner with a lockie and burlman they all sit up there
[46:26.660 --> 46:31.580]  with the with the four American leaders of al-Qaeda all from America of course they're
[46:31.580 --> 46:38.220]  from America al-Qaeda is run by the banks that run this country but the American people
[46:38.220 --> 46:42.020]  want to give up all their rights and be raped financially by the mega banks have all their
[46:42.020 --> 46:46.900]  private property taken because it's so much fun to hate Muslims and you're like well okay
[46:46.900 --> 46:52.220]  the Muslim extremists are run by the West no they're not you know guys will you put
[46:52.220 --> 46:57.740]  up the Newsweek cover the war against Christians Newsweek cover the war against Christians
[46:57.740 --> 47:02.980]  and it's not the globalist war against Christmas and Christianity or saying churches have got
[47:02.980 --> 47:08.900]  to sell day after pills and you know and support abortion and hire people of different religions
[47:08.900 --> 47:14.780]  and government totally getting involved in church which the First Amendment bans contrary
[47:14.780 --> 47:20.460]  to the inverted baloney about churches can't be involved in anything it's the opposite Congress
[47:20.460 --> 47:26.300]  and the government have no jurisdiction period they've got their big war but now because
[47:26.300 --> 47:31.060]  they're getting ready for a war with Iran they invoke oh after attacking Christians
[47:31.060 --> 47:37.180]  all day Christians are under attack from Muslims all over the world and so let's have a war
[47:37.180 --> 47:41.220]  with them and that's actually true the Muslims on average living on two dollars a day in
[47:41.220 --> 47:48.780]  the Middle East are killing each other constantly Shiite Sunni other groups and you bet sometimes
[47:48.780 --> 47:53.900]  they have riots just like just like the Catholics and the Protestants in New York getting fights
[47:53.900 --> 47:58.540]  or the Puerto Ricans and the black folks getting fights exactly absolutely it's going on and
[47:58.540 --> 48:02.340]  you bet they actually fund Wahabi is to come to power in places in North Africa where they
[48:02.340 --> 48:09.900]  actually are killing Christians that's actually in the Newsweek article again you just type
[48:09.900 --> 48:13.900]  in Newsweek cover the war on Christians it's all over the place on newsstands I bought
[48:13.900 --> 48:17.940]  a copy three four days ago forgot to bring into the offices at my house and it shows
[48:17.940 --> 48:22.420]  the face of Jesus a painting of Jesus with like blood spattered on on the ground from
[48:22.420 --> 48:27.340]  some riot and even in the article are like oh and Libya to the extremists now we're going
[48:27.340 --> 48:33.220]  after Christians and don't mention our criminal government put them in power there you see
[48:33.220 --> 48:37.900]  how that works you see how they operate here I bet I can find it right here oh there it
[48:37.900 --> 48:47.180]  is yep the war on Christians there it is Jesus's face with blood all over it oh look
[48:47.180 --> 48:56.380]  there they're killing our Lord they're desecrating him kill the Muslims kill the Arabs kill the
[48:56.380 --> 49:01.940]  brown people meanwhile the criminals that run our government absolutely hate Christianity
[49:01.940 --> 49:06.860]  and are telling churches now okay you've been 501c3 we violated the first amendment we're
[49:06.860 --> 49:10.980]  running your church now you're a charity not a church now you're going to teach abortion
[49:10.980 --> 49:14.660]  now you're going to hand out these pills and condoms now you're going to hire people that
[49:14.660 --> 49:18.820]  aren't Christian how's that sound but this in the war on Christianity though it's the
[49:18.820 --> 49:27.980]  Muslims and they use examples of basically gang fighting between Christians and Muslims
[49:27.980 --> 49:36.340]  around the world by the way the Muslims have always been very tolerant of other religions
[49:36.340 --> 49:43.620]  it's that you can't convert to Islam and then go back and Christianity predates Islam and
[49:43.620 --> 49:48.580]  Islam whether you agree with that or not says that it is an offshoot of Christianity and
[49:48.580 --> 49:54.500]  Judaism and worships the same God and they follow Moses and the whole nine yards ladies
[49:54.500 --> 49:58.860]  and gentlemen but they don't teach that in the media they say they want to kill Jesus
[49:58.860 --> 50:03.740]  that's what that article says they hate Jesus they want to get Jesus they want him they
[50:03.740 --> 50:09.500]  hate him that's what they teach that's what they teach on talk radio I hear the Christian
[50:09.500 --> 50:14.340]  radio stations and my point is the globalists want us to have World War three with the Muslims
[50:14.340 --> 50:19.060]  as Albert Pike and other globalists wrote so then they can demonize all religion and
[50:19.060 --> 50:23.220]  bring in this UN world religion where you're not allowed to actually have any beliefs you've
[50:23.220 --> 50:33.500]  got to follow this Gaia garbage which isn't even about the earth all right when I come
[50:33.500 --> 50:39.860]  back I'm gonna run through a box of the other news it's just when I read about 30,000 drones
[50:39.860 --> 50:42.540]  and of course they're gonna roll them out the non-threatening way all the military is
[50:42.540 --> 50:46.140]  just doing drills for overseas next oh now they're gonna be in America for you know they
[50:46.140 --> 50:51.420]  are for the citizens all the drones are for traffic that Reaper is for is for traffic
[50:51.420 --> 50:56.740]  direction and again they're lying to us using Pentagon tactics of deception because we're
[50:56.740 --> 51:01.620]  the enemy that's why you don't have a military involved domestically I've been telling you

[1:11:53.900 --> 1:11:58.740]  huge evidence of fraud i know lou likes to you know it you know probably not even cover
[1:11:58.740 --> 1:12:03.740]  that too much because you know it's been admitted in isle and admitted in other places the media
[1:12:03.740 --> 1:12:10.100]  uses it to say we're bad sports we're no we're not bad sports for watching a don king match
[1:12:10.100 --> 1:12:16.580]  and you know it's a rig boxing match i mean it's going on so i want to talk ron paul first
[1:12:16.580 --> 1:12:20.660]  here regardless as you know lou he's winning by getting the word out about liberty and
[1:12:20.660 --> 1:12:25.100]  building a platform for liberty in the future and despite them saying he can't win with that
[1:12:25.100 --> 1:12:30.100]  mantra he's he's he's he's doubled in almost every state or more the votes he got last
[1:12:30.100 --> 1:12:34.500]  time but overall what's your view of what's happening in this campaign right now well
[1:12:34.500 --> 1:12:38.860]  i thought one thing that happened very recently that that's maybe a symbol of other things
[1:12:38.860 --> 1:12:45.220]  is what happened at cpaq cpaq is an annual gathering of all the corrupt belway republican
[1:12:45.220 --> 1:12:52.580]  elites and consultants and the whole the whole gang there of the ruling aspects of the republican
[1:12:52.580 --> 1:12:58.700]  party they also allow young people to come and they have politicians speak in the last
[1:12:58.700 --> 1:13:02.700]  two years they have a each year they have a presidential straw poll and the last two
[1:13:02.700 --> 1:13:07.220]  years ron paul has won that straw poll overwhelmingly because of the young people he attracts to
[1:13:07.220 --> 1:13:12.340]  come to that meeting because he's going to speak there and because as always you know
[1:13:12.340 --> 1:13:16.420]  it's something that i've never seen in my whole lifetime duplicated he attracts young
[1:13:16.420 --> 1:13:22.740]  people in the most amazing way educates them and of course they they lay down in front
[1:13:22.740 --> 1:13:26.980]  of the in front of the railroad car for him and they go to these meetings and they've
[1:13:26.980 --> 1:13:32.700]  elected him in these straw polls well this cpaq very openly the card card in the head
[1:13:32.700 --> 1:13:35.980]  of it and and the other people associated with it say they don't want this to happen
[1:13:35.980 --> 1:13:42.300]  again so they're they're changing their voting system from a paper ballot to electronic voting
[1:13:42.300 --> 1:13:47.820]  so my guess is ron's not going to win this straw poll at cpaq this year in fact he's
[1:13:47.820 --> 1:13:51.380]  not going to be there speaking is going to be campaigning in main and the campaign i
[1:13:51.380 --> 1:13:57.180]  think very correctly decided that they did not want to put any energy and effort into
[1:13:57.180 --> 1:14:01.460]  into cpaq this time but they want to prevent him from winning and i guess they're going
[1:14:01.460 --> 1:14:04.780]  to prevent him from winning even though you'll get the number of votes are going to be a
[1:14:04.780 --> 1:14:08.220]  lot of young people there but you know how can you trust these people i i always think
[1:14:08.220 --> 1:14:12.860]  the same is true about any election and you mentioned avada iowa and other places that
[1:14:12.860 --> 1:14:18.420]  we are ready to be suspicious of but here we have a group of people politicians who
[1:14:18.420 --> 1:14:24.300]  are happy let's just take one example happy and anxious to kill a million people in iraq
[1:14:24.300 --> 1:14:30.980]  start a war against the country that never did anything to us to engage in immense property
[1:14:30.980 --> 1:14:35.780]  destruction the death of a million people the ethnic cleansing of many more millions
[1:14:35.780 --> 1:14:41.460]  the destruction of the christian communities in iraq that have existed un molested since
[1:14:41.460 --> 1:14:46.780]  the time of christ now are wiped out so the people are we supposed to think that the people
[1:14:46.780 --> 1:14:51.980]  have no trouble doing that or bailing out the banks or a million and one other crimes
[1:14:51.980 --> 1:14:57.260]  are we supposed to think that they actually would hesitate to steal an election so that's
[1:14:57.260 --> 1:15:01.540]  not proof that they're doing it of course but but let's not kid ourselves these are
[1:15:01.540 --> 1:15:05.180]  that these people are somehow morally above stealing an election where they're happy to
[1:15:05.180 --> 1:15:10.460]  start a war happy to take the engage in this vast program of redistribution where they
[1:15:10.460 --> 1:15:14.180]  take yes the productive and give it to the unproductive and so forth all the rest of
[1:15:14.180 --> 1:15:20.220]  the things that politicians do so well look at fast and furious daily sure me look at
[1:15:20.220 --> 1:15:24.540]  fast and furious caught shipping guns into mexico we say it's to blame the second amendment
[1:15:24.540 --> 1:15:29.260]  and then the memo comes out cbs news to blame the second amendment that's a false flag but
[1:15:29.260 --> 1:15:36.260]  let me raise this point nbc has the headline that israel works with terror group and you
[1:15:36.260 --> 1:15:42.140]  read it's an al-qaeda group to kill scientists in iran well bush was doing that as well and
[1:15:42.140 --> 1:15:45.820]  now they've given al-qaeda control of libya the even la times admits they're putting
[1:15:45.820 --> 1:15:53.500]  al-qaeda groups in via nato into syria so how can they freak out when people point out
[1:15:53.500 --> 1:15:58.620]  that our own government is is is even working with these groups out of saudi arabia i mean
[1:15:58.620 --> 1:16:05.420]  this is in the news now that they're this evil well al-qaeda we always have to remember
[1:16:05.420 --> 1:16:09.820]  and i'm not myself i'm sure what that is it's certainly an ideological tendency maybe it's
[1:16:09.820 --> 1:16:14.300]  more than that but it's the extent that it's an organized group it was founded and funded
[1:16:14.300 --> 1:16:19.020]  by the u.s. government in the war against the russians and afghanistan this is where
[1:16:19.020 --> 1:16:23.500]  osama bin laden came into it and all these similar people were being funded through
[1:16:23.500 --> 1:16:28.620]  pakistan and directly by the cia to fight the russians and then the one of the things
[1:16:28.620 --> 1:16:33.500]  the u.s. did in order to fight the russians was gather every what they would now refer
[1:16:33.500 --> 1:16:40.700]  to as islamic extremists into into that battle to go into afghanistan and and eventually
[1:16:40.700 --> 1:16:46.780]  of course they did toss out the russian so this whole group uh... has had cia connections
[1:16:46.780 --> 1:16:51.020]  from the very beginning and uh... so yeah they've been put into libya they're putting
[1:16:51.820 --> 1:16:57.580]  u.s. wants like any empire the romans had the rule uh... defeated emperor divide and
[1:16:57.580 --> 1:17:02.620]  conquer divide and rule divide and dominate and so that's the way empires work so they
[1:17:02.620 --> 1:17:07.420]  want to cause trouble because the more if people are peaceful and happy there's no room to make
[1:17:07.420 --> 1:17:13.340]  trouble so they want unrest they want war they want destruction because it enables them to
[1:17:13.340 --> 1:17:18.300]  take power and enrich themselves and all the rest of the things that empires do so yeah this is
[1:17:18.300 --> 1:17:22.540]  this is uh... they're getting rid of one way to look at what's happening to syria and the same
[1:17:22.540 --> 1:17:28.780]  thing in iraq they're getting rid of the last secular arab the last non-islamic uh... arab regime
[1:17:28.780 --> 1:17:34.380]  in the world syria i'm no fan of basad but what uh... on the other hand is what i think we can
[1:17:34.380 --> 1:17:41.020]  see from iraq there were the things can get worse and so uh... i know that the uh... al-qaeda groups
[1:17:41.020 --> 1:17:48.460]  the islamicist groups that are coming to power by the u.s. of nato uh... in syria want to ethnically
[1:17:48.460 --> 1:17:53.180]  cleanse all the christians out of syria again this is a country that's had very ancient christian
[1:17:53.180 --> 1:17:58.620]  communities to go back to the time of christ uh... they want to get them out maybe they'll murder
[1:17:58.620 --> 1:18:02.060]  them too but they certainly want to throw them out of their homes and push them out of the country
[1:18:02.060 --> 1:18:07.020]  the same with the minority alawites which is a uh... a muslim sect that the other muslims
[1:18:07.020 --> 1:18:12.300]  think of as heretical uh... that's what Assad belongs to they want to they want to kill them
[1:18:12.300 --> 1:18:15.180]  that's what they're saying they're going to put them up against the wall and shoot them the christians
[1:18:15.180 --> 1:18:19.340]  they're only going to ethnically cleanse them thanks a lot so uh... this is being promoted by
[1:18:19.340 --> 1:18:25.100]  the u.s. government uh... hillary clinton the warlord s and so forth calling on uh... more
[1:18:25.100 --> 1:18:29.980]  destruction the so-called syrian free army is entirely a creation of the u.s. and again
[1:18:29.980 --> 1:18:35.820]  this is a dictatorship this is not a this is not a and now it's escalating this is a bad government
[1:18:35.820 --> 1:18:41.340]  i'll agree but they're going to make it worse just as in libya well exactly and then newsweek
[1:18:41.340 --> 1:18:45.740]  comes out and says there's a war on christians everywhere they show it's western proxy groups
[1:18:45.740 --> 1:18:49.740]  that are killing the christians and you watch when the jihadis kill the christians they're
[1:18:49.740 --> 1:18:53.980]  going to spin that and say we got to have more wars the muslims are killing the christians
[1:18:53.980 --> 1:18:58.780]  all because the general public isn't paying attention and they say tsa's got to grow pure
[1:18:58.780 --> 1:19:05.260]  wife and take your baby's diaper off and give you a you know a uh... genital exam because of al-qaeda
[1:19:05.260 --> 1:19:11.980]  and you're like but you're running al-qaeda it's just amazing well this is this is this is the way
[1:19:11.980 --> 1:19:18.300]  of empires i mean pretty much uh... i think we can always assume in in the old british formulation
[1:19:18.300 --> 1:19:22.460]  that you shouldn't believe anything from the government until it's officially denied yes you
[1:19:22.460 --> 1:19:25.980]  can't really believe anything the government says these people and especially when you get into
[1:19:25.980 --> 1:19:31.180]  intelligence areas and military areas these people are professional liars i mean that's their job to
[1:19:31.180 --> 1:19:37.340]  lie to kill steel and so forth that's their that's their thing in life so uh... sometimes people from
[1:19:37.340 --> 1:19:42.540]  the government tell the truth we have this lieutenant colonel uh... with this uh...
[1:19:42.540 --> 1:19:46.300]  press of new article on afghanistan out in the armed forces journal so it happens
[1:19:46.300 --> 1:19:51.660]  but uh... i tell you what stay there lou former ron paul chief of staff head of the von mis institute

[1:24:05.900 --> 1:24:12.940]  about ron paul or other issues he is uh quite the brain pretty much a ron paul clone and that's
[1:24:12.940 --> 1:24:19.180]  a compliment or maybe ron paul's a lou rockwell clone doesn't matter does it we're of the same mind
[1:24:19.180 --> 1:24:28.700]  liberty and more of it and still more the toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231
[1:24:29.900 --> 1:24:36.300]  800-259-9231 well lou if there was ever a seal of approval that ron paul was the good guy
[1:24:36.300 --> 1:24:40.940]  it's the demonization the attacks the whole political system lining up against him the
[1:24:40.940 --> 1:24:45.660]  trendies uh in hollywood coming out against him but then so many other endorsements across the
[1:24:45.660 --> 1:24:51.740]  political spectrum it shows that liberty's rising but you know you say not you know not 100%
[1:24:51.740 --> 1:24:56.300]  proof of fraud i mean look he he doubled or more in every other caucus what he got four years ago
[1:24:56.300 --> 1:25:01.580]  except nevada we've shown the graphs exact results he got four years ago that's just him being too
[1:25:01.580 --> 1:25:06.620]  lazy to fix the machines exit polls not showing the same thing they've said the iowa caucuses are
[1:25:06.620 --> 1:25:10.940]  going to be thrown out but don't say what that means they admitted that they would drive the
[1:25:10.940 --> 1:25:15.740]  ballots in precincts where paul was winning and then never report them i mean there is evidence
[1:25:15.740 --> 1:25:20.780]  of fraud uh it's just that yeah if ron paul starts talking about it then i guess he has to keep
[1:25:20.780 --> 1:25:26.620]  moving forward but uh why do you think paul hasn't talked more about this well my guess is the
[1:25:26.620 --> 1:25:31.260]  first of all of course he's concentrating on the campaign he's working very hard in main right now
[1:25:31.260 --> 1:25:37.740]  where things are looking very very good um but i've you know he would have to have proof i'm sure
[1:25:37.740 --> 1:25:45.340]  he uh he feels he has to deal with it within the system as it is and uh if he had if he felt he
[1:25:45.340 --> 1:25:50.380]  had proof he would talk about it but he doesn't feel he has proof so therefore he he uh he doesn't
[1:25:50.380 --> 1:25:54.860]  talk about it and again he wants to always concentrate on the key issues he wants to talk
[1:25:54.860 --> 1:25:59.500]  about the cause of peace he wants to talk about the federal reserve he wants to talk about our
[1:25:59.500 --> 1:26:04.540]  civil liberties he wants to talk about government deficits and spending on all the various crimes
[1:26:04.540 --> 1:26:09.660]  that are going on and that's what he knows about that's what he wants to talk about and he always
[1:26:09.660 --> 1:26:14.460]  takes the high road this guy always and like anybody else in politics he always takes the
[1:26:14.460 --> 1:26:20.460]  high road so it's just not just not this is this is for other people to discuss uh ron is talking
[1:26:20.460 --> 1:26:24.860]  about the issues that matter not only to our country but to the whole world because this is a
[1:26:24.860 --> 1:26:32.300]  worldwide phenomenon of the of the increase of dictatorship and of corporatism of a fascist
[1:26:32.300 --> 1:26:38.300]  economic system and all the other horrible things of course the wars all the dead uh the people maimed
[1:26:38.300 --> 1:26:43.900]  and the diseases and starvation that are being promoted by the u.s uh as these are what they
[1:26:43.900 --> 1:26:49.740]  call sanctions um so that's you know that's what's he's okay i don't by the way i don't speak for
[1:26:49.740 --> 1:26:57.100]  ron uh in any sense uh but just my supposition that this is why he wants to take the somebody's
[1:26:57.100 --> 1:27:02.860]  always been his whole life he takes the high road well and sure there's not a hundred percent smoking
[1:27:02.860 --> 1:27:07.340]  gun we just know there's fraud and chicanery going on but that shouldn't keep people from
[1:27:07.340 --> 1:27:11.900]  getting out there and supporting him because because he still has a chance to win i mean he's
[1:27:11.900 --> 1:27:16.460]  coming in second place third place first place when he does they don't give it any attention
[1:27:16.460 --> 1:27:21.260]  but he's getting a lot of delegates and even politico i was reading today is saying this could
[1:27:21.260 --> 1:27:26.380]  get contested now because you know nobody's going to really have a majority of the delegates i am
[1:27:26.380 --> 1:27:30.700]  and a lot of people are going and becoming delegates so we're what could happen in the
[1:27:30.700 --> 1:27:36.140]  convention well first of all it's possible to win the nomination without ever having won a primary
[1:27:36.140 --> 1:27:41.340]  yes so he can accumulate he is accumulating delegates and there's all kinds of uh people
[1:27:41.340 --> 1:27:46.700]  i've talked to in in these recent elections ron paul people who were elected as delegates
[1:27:46.700 --> 1:27:51.260]  so uh they didn't have to vote for whoever wins you know centaur or whatever on the first ballot
[1:27:51.260 --> 1:27:56.860]  although there's even a question about that but in a contested convention then they're free at
[1:27:56.860 --> 1:28:00.860]  some point maybe it's after the first ballot sometimes it's after the second ballot they're
[1:28:00.860 --> 1:28:06.860]  free to vote their conscience and of course that's that's ron paul so um it is absolutely important
[1:28:06.860 --> 1:28:12.700]  to work for him to vote for him to help him out to donate to his cause because this is the cause
[1:28:12.700 --> 1:28:18.300]  of liberty this is the cause of our future this is the cause of if we care about the life that
[1:28:18.300 --> 1:28:22.140]  our kids and our grandkids and our future descendants are going to have we don't be
[1:28:22.140 --> 1:28:27.820]  going to be living in some kind of fascist wasteland we better support ron paul and they
[1:28:27.820 --> 1:28:35.260]  can't steal everything they only steal on the margin uh so uh absolutely even though we think
[1:28:35.260 --> 1:28:39.980]  the system is potentially entirely crooked or partially crooked but he still is having an
[1:28:39.980 --> 1:28:46.220]  effect uh the crowds he's drawing and everywhere he goes whether it's minnesota main or colorado
[1:28:46.220 --> 1:28:51.340]  or whatever he draws vast crowds and gingrich by the way draws nobody even though he's allegedly
[1:28:51.340 --> 1:28:56.140]  getting well that's the thing as i see ron paul stickers all over the country he's got all these
[1:28:56.140 --> 1:29:02.460]  celebrity endorsements congressional endorsements incredible support sometimes he has 20 000 people
[1:29:02.460 --> 1:29:08.300]  10 000 routinely small crowds are 6 000 and gingrich literally shows up and one person's there and
[1:29:08.300 --> 1:29:14.540]  it turns out they're paid 93 as uh the news reported of his twitter's are fake it's the same
[1:29:14.540 --> 1:29:21.740]  thing with romney i mean this is obviously it's a fraud but again i want to come back and get more
[1:29:21.740 --> 1:29:26.300]  into what you think we can do to get ron paul in there i want to hit some other news items get your
[1:29:26.300 --> 1:29:30.860]  view on where this world's going and take phone calls with lu rockwell and ask him where he sees
[1:29:30.860 --> 1:29:35.660]  the economy going he's really an expert in economics more than anything founding the
[1:29:35.660 --> 1:29:43.340]  ludavangmese institute um so that's all coming up but we are definitely seeing a huge awakening
[1:29:43.340 --> 1:29:47.260]  i don't want to ask you about that on the other side because people are getting angry
[1:29:47.260 --> 1:29:52.860]  i'm getting angrier we're not mincing words we're on the march the empire's on the run

[1:33:12.140 --> 1:33:21.420]  to see an explosion of catastrophe like nothing you've ever seen before watch closely as i open this
[1:33:21.420 --> 1:33:30.540]  door your door will be on the floor after this you'll be begging for more welcome to the
[1:33:32.060 --> 1:33:36.860]  all right lou rockwell's our guest at the end of the hour and then i've got an internal military
[1:33:36.860 --> 1:33:42.140]  source at a fema camp training base which the wall street journal admits they've built emergency
[1:33:42.140 --> 1:33:47.100]  centers and they army times admits they're training for civilian inmate labor camp guards
[1:33:47.100 --> 1:33:52.060]  and i have the emergency centers establishment act but it's a conspiracy theory even though
[1:33:52.060 --> 1:33:57.020]  i've been to the urban warfare drills and showed the military training to put americans in camps
[1:33:57.020 --> 1:34:03.900]  just last year we sent the crew to chicago and it showed local police with troops with roleplayers
[1:34:04.540 --> 1:34:09.180]  they got the girl scouts and boy scouts to be part of it's being handcuffed and taken into a
[1:34:09.180 --> 1:34:14.300]  to the sports stadium oh man the system just counts on us being ignorant i want to get into
[1:34:14.300 --> 1:34:19.340]  the economy more on ron paul lou rockwell but i mean you really are a intellect historically
[1:34:20.220 --> 1:34:24.860]  you understand history you've got a very interesting you know perspective on things
[1:34:24.860 --> 1:34:30.300]  that i respect and value but i'm really starting to get freaked out it's one thing to know all
[1:34:30.300 --> 1:34:35.340]  this tyranny is coming to see it repeat itself in history to have homeland security admit that
[1:34:35.340 --> 1:34:40.060]  they want to set up a tyranny to have all these flyers i just showed the listeners and viewers
[1:34:40.060 --> 1:34:45.180]  that the fbi has on their site saying if somebody pays with cash get their license number and report
[1:34:45.180 --> 1:34:51.820]  them uh if somebody's in an internet cafe using an internet proxy call the police on them uh i mean
[1:34:52.860 --> 1:35:01.900]  it's clearly to make everybody a suspect and now i was reading even in the new york times 63 billion
[1:35:01.900 --> 1:35:09.580]  for the f a a over the next four years they've passed the legislation and it says half the money
[1:35:10.140 --> 1:35:15.820]  is for a fleet of drones including reapers and predators that are armed i mean this is in the
[1:35:15.820 --> 1:35:22.220]  news and and then it's like i'm waking up in the twilight zone i'm watching fox news a clip on
[1:35:22.220 --> 1:35:29.900]  youtube and they've got a hovercraft unmanned thing that fires tasers at people i mean what
[1:35:29.900 --> 1:35:37.340]  more it's just and then the russians are putting spitsnets into syria uh the iranians are sending
[1:35:37.340 --> 1:35:43.420]  in their people hillary says it's war uh they just blew up libya and admit they've killed like 40
[1:35:43.420 --> 1:35:47.980]  thousand people they're lining them up they're torturing the french ambassador they've run al-qaeda
[1:35:47.980 --> 1:35:54.220]  flags up i mean it ruling elites we know go crazy from studying this do you think we've reached a
[1:35:54.220 --> 1:36:00.540]  nero or calligula or hitler invading russia moment where the anglo-american banking cartel
[1:36:00.540 --> 1:36:06.380]  has just gone completely bonkers because i mean they already started a war with russia on 888
[1:36:06.380 --> 1:36:12.460]  and backed off it just i'm freaked out i know i'm ranting sir what do you say to that well i think
[1:36:12.460 --> 1:36:17.820]  it's i i share you know i share your concern i think there's no question that the neoconservatives
[1:36:17.820 --> 1:36:24.140]  especially have got a crazy gene and uh they think that they can just start any war and uh
[1:36:24.140 --> 1:36:28.780]  it'll only have the effects that they hope it'll have and not you know spread so are they wanting
[1:36:28.780 --> 1:36:35.500]  to start with you know is is obama and hillary and of course these people are just really uh
[1:36:35.500 --> 1:36:40.140]  sticky sticky faces on the lapel of the oligarchy they're not really running things but they're the
[1:36:40.140 --> 1:36:46.620]  spokespeople uh the other they want to they want a regional war um they want destruction
[1:36:46.620 --> 1:36:51.580]  it enabled they all government always loves war because it suppresses internal dissent
[1:36:51.580 --> 1:36:55.820]  and it makes taxation easier and if you're questioning the government you're unpatriotic
[1:36:55.820 --> 1:37:01.260]  and and all the rest of it but i you know it is alarming and i've like you alex i've fought against
[1:37:01.260 --> 1:37:06.220]  this stuff all my life and i've worried about it and try to do what i could against it but the
[1:37:06.220 --> 1:37:11.580]  speed of it since 9 11 is really quite extraordinary the speed of it the increasing fascism that's
[1:37:11.580 --> 1:37:17.900]  worth we live in a roosevelt was our first fascist president that we we've had a mild fascism
[1:37:17.900 --> 1:37:23.900]  by other country standards but now it's becoming a tough fascism and uh in terms of our civil
[1:37:23.900 --> 1:37:28.300]  liberties in terms of you know overly admitting that they have the military arrest you and put
[1:37:28.300 --> 1:37:33.980]  you on a secret camp and uh and make the arrest secret have a secret trial secret torture and
[1:37:33.980 --> 1:37:39.500]  secret death penalty uh and this is what the government admits they admit to this you know
[1:37:39.500 --> 1:37:43.180]  we don't know what they're doing that they don't admit to listen i was talking to a guy
[1:37:43.180 --> 1:37:48.140]  who's given us good info in the past last night he's coming on the last 30 minutes today at a
[1:37:48.140 --> 1:37:55.180]  military base in missouri and the guy started crying on the phone and of course he can't say
[1:37:55.180 --> 1:38:01.020]  everything on air because it'll give away who he is but he says and we've got photos of this
[1:38:01.020 --> 1:38:06.140]  it's double barbed wire on the base with with barbed wire around each little building and he
[1:38:06.140 --> 1:38:12.780]  was telling me inside of these buildings they are actual torture centers i mean this country
[1:38:12.780 --> 1:38:17.340]  is in deep drop but look people say oh that's a conspiracy theory i've got congressman and
[1:38:17.340 --> 1:38:22.700]  senators saying we'll torture americans we want you to be scared you ask for a lawyer we say shut
[1:38:22.700 --> 1:38:28.620]  up you don't get a lawyer uh and and and saying they'll kill citizens i mean so it's not even
[1:38:28.620 --> 1:38:35.500]  debatable it's just that to talk to military people and others who were on this base and others
[1:38:35.500 --> 1:38:41.500]  and they're like no these are actual interrogation torture rooms i mean it's it's just a lawless
[1:38:41.500 --> 1:38:47.020]  criminal government law well i think is as murray rockport said the state is simply a gang of thieves
[1:38:47.020 --> 1:38:53.180]  writ large so there really is nothing beyond the government these people again they they kill they
[1:38:53.180 --> 1:39:00.780]  steal they lie as their normal their normal mo so uh although because nothing is beyond them it
[1:39:00.780 --> 1:39:04.460]  doesn't mean they're doing everything but if they're not doing something evil either they haven't
[1:39:04.460 --> 1:39:09.580]  thought of it or they don't think it's in their interest but they the u.s. government and any
[1:39:09.580 --> 1:39:13.980]  government is never going to say oh gee i can't do that because it's immoral well here's an example
[1:39:13.980 --> 1:39:19.420]  london guardian yesterday for sure london guardian yesterday they found a bunch of new black torture
[1:39:19.420 --> 1:39:26.460]  sites secret sites uh in europe and uh in iraq i mean they've got black sites everywhere and they've
[1:39:26.460 --> 1:39:32.380]  got rendition centers and u.s. aircraft flying folks out that's admitted well yeah and of course
[1:39:32.380 --> 1:39:37.100]  i mean they're people associated with national review for example back in the 1950s were advocating
[1:39:37.100 --> 1:39:43.980]  torture and this has always been a part of the sort of the conservative movement and uh of the
[1:39:43.980 --> 1:39:48.700]  people who want a unitary executive they're all they're all pro-torture they like torture
[1:39:48.700 --> 1:39:52.700]  and this is of course moving down into the there's always been a little bit of this in the local
[1:39:52.700 --> 1:39:58.380]  police but now it's it's much more overwhelming at all levels state police local police all these
[1:39:58.380 --> 1:40:05.100]  all these other armed agencies that exist at all levels of the government and then the drones i saw
[1:40:05.100 --> 1:40:11.740]  an alarming youtube recently a little tiny drones that are able to fly in in formation formation
[1:40:11.740 --> 1:40:16.220]  and of course these things can be blown up too so they're they're they're capable of killing but
[1:40:16.220 --> 1:40:20.940]  they're spy drones and they're the little tiny thing smaller than a hummingbird but here's an
[1:40:20.940 --> 1:40:26.780]  example of the twilight zone nature remember five years ago in dc activists said there were little
[1:40:26.780 --> 1:40:33.420]  bitty fake dragonflies flying around us and the news was these are crazy people and then one year
[1:40:33.420 --> 1:40:39.500]  later the very same washington post came out and said oh they were right the DARPA was testing
[1:40:39.500 --> 1:40:45.020]  surveillance dragonflies and they've got fake hummingbirds loo i mean it's it's just crazy
[1:40:46.300 --> 1:40:51.820]  well again there's nothing beyond them and you know they're they're their desire every government
[1:40:51.820 --> 1:40:57.020]  would love to be a totalitarian state and we're moving very quickly into that uh towards that
[1:40:57.020 --> 1:41:01.580]  they all they all have that ambition they would the u.s government like to control every dime you've
[1:41:01.580 --> 1:41:08.220]  got every dime you spend every everything about your children your home your community your church
[1:41:08.220 --> 1:41:14.620]  your business everything they want total control and they want uh they don't want anything standing
[1:41:14.620 --> 1:41:20.380]  between the naked individual in the state that's why they hate the state's rights it's why they hate
[1:41:20.380 --> 1:41:26.220]  churches it's why they hate businesses charities anything that might the people might be loyal to
[1:41:26.220 --> 1:41:30.940]  they hate families they don't want any people being loyal to anything except the federal government
[1:41:30.940 --> 1:41:35.180]  and its subsidiaries in the state and the local government they all were there all you mentioned
[1:41:35.180 --> 1:41:40.940]  this they hate god there the state has always been envious of god they'd like to return to the days
[1:41:40.940 --> 1:41:46.220]  of the pharaoh where the government was god that's that's their ideal but when they but they can't
[1:41:46.220 --> 1:41:51.660]  get away with that but uh they hate religion they hate it except if it's a worship of the state
[1:41:51.660 --> 1:41:56.620]  religion so these and that's their guy that's the whole that's the whole guy a global government
[1:41:56.620 --> 1:42:01.580]  thing they're setting up well okay let me raise this before we get into economy and then some calls i
[1:42:01.580 --> 1:42:06.940]  think it's really backfiring on them though the government health care the india a all you know
[1:42:06.940 --> 1:42:12.140]  the open admissions of of wanting to censor people all these different white house advisors not just
[1:42:12.140 --> 1:42:16.460]  cast sense team but others are saying i saw an article two weeks ago where they're like banned
[1:42:16.460 --> 1:42:23.420]  blogs that criticize electric cars because those are failing i mean they're so naked and brazen
[1:42:23.420 --> 1:42:30.540]  in their tyranny and in their wanton attempt to dominate us but it's backfiring i think they
[1:42:30.540 --> 1:42:37.900]  took americans decadence and laziness on average as a sign of cowardice and i think it's the opposite
[1:42:37.900 --> 1:42:43.020]  we've had it so good because liberty produced so much we got lazy but i'm telling you the sleeping
[1:42:43.020 --> 1:42:48.620]  giant is waking up right now and i saw a video out of houston where the cops go to a first amendment
[1:42:48.620 --> 1:42:53.740]  rally of some in the fetters who i know i've been down there to speak with them cock a shotgun and
[1:42:53.740 --> 1:42:59.020]  the people start howling and and so and you coward you scum and the cops all get scared back off
[1:42:59.020 --> 1:43:03.340]  they don't get it when they start pulling shotguns out we're not scared anymore just like we weren't
[1:43:03.340 --> 1:43:08.700]  scared of redcoats lou i don't think they understand it's not that we were scared of them we were just
[1:43:08.700 --> 1:43:12.860]  lazy do you see what i'm saying well there are no there are a number of reasons to be optimistic
[1:43:12.860 --> 1:43:17.580]  we know we mentioned the ron paul campaign but also the fact that more and more young people
[1:43:17.580 --> 1:43:22.460]  are waking up more and more americans are waking up and you know this does this does represent
[1:43:22.460 --> 1:43:27.580]  evil and also from an economic standpoint the u.s government is the biggest bureaucracy ever to
[1:43:27.580 --> 1:43:32.380]  exist in the history of the world by many magnitudes and one of the things we know about bureaucracy
[1:43:32.380 --> 1:43:37.180]  is because it's in unbelievably inefficient unbelievably screwed up and you know you just
[1:43:37.180 --> 1:43:40.940]  have to look at things like for example all the monuments the government builds to itself you
[1:43:40.940 --> 1:43:44.700]  can't even build a good-looking monument anymore they couldn't look at what happened and could
[1:43:44.700 --> 1:43:49.740]  train to look at every look at the you know they are able to kill a lot of people but that's about
[1:43:49.740 --> 1:43:53.980]  it that's about the only thing the government can do they mess up everything else so this is
[1:43:53.980 --> 1:43:59.020]  stirring opposition there is far more knowledgeable opposition today to what they're doing to the
[1:43:59.020 --> 1:44:05.580]  economy civil liberties the war and so forth for the first time there's been created you know a a
[1:44:05.580 --> 1:44:11.180]  non-left-wing anti-war movement of this country thanks to ron paul uh the first that existed
[1:44:11.180 --> 1:44:17.020]  in the in decades they fear this they hate it they want to suppress it but you know thanks to the
[1:44:17.020 --> 1:44:24.620]  internet and uh you know people like you the information gets out so um i think there's
[1:44:24.620 --> 1:44:30.140]  much new i i think the government is much weaker than it looks it looks to be an impregnable fortress
[1:44:30.140 --> 1:44:34.860]  with all these weapons it's over but they're not they're a small minority we are the majority
[1:44:34.860 --> 1:44:40.540]  i totally agree and they depend on our consent and if we don't give them our consent then they
[1:44:40.540 --> 1:44:45.180]  fall and so that's what they're afraid of and that's that's the weapon we have to use it the
[1:44:45.180 --> 1:44:49.740]  peaceful weapon we can't even killing people is the government's way that's not our way
[1:44:49.740 --> 1:44:55.420]  but if we withdraw our consent if we tell the truth about them they can be brought down they're
[1:44:55.420 --> 1:45:00.780]  actually in a weak position all over the world uh and also as we talked about earlier they're
[1:45:00.780 --> 1:45:06.460]  also crazy so yeah just like uh chuchescu or any of these people who've been in power for so many
[1:45:06.460 --> 1:45:11.420]  years uh it warps their brains it warps them morally too but it warps their intelligence
[1:45:11.420 --> 1:45:16.140]  it warps everything about them and they become less and less effective as they get delusional
[1:45:16.140 --> 1:45:20.620]  it's like any delusional it's like a first generation wealthy person who made their money
[1:45:20.620 --> 1:45:25.420]  is on target the next generation starts getting spoiled and decadent third generation total
[1:45:25.420 --> 1:45:31.820]  spoiled brats not living in reality and and 30 000 drones robots that's not going to protect them
[1:45:31.820 --> 1:45:37.340]  they're they're they're attempting to pile on all this all this garbage in an attempt to intimidate
[1:45:37.340 --> 1:45:42.220]  us well i mean take this thing where they're going into churches and saying uh obama you're
[1:45:42.220 --> 1:45:47.260]  going to hire people who you don't agree with religiously and attacking the the right of free
[1:45:47.260 --> 1:45:52.540]  association the first amendment the heart of it and saying you're going to sell morning after pills
[1:45:52.540 --> 1:45:56.460]  in your vending machines that was in the news and you're going to you know pay for people's
[1:45:56.460 --> 1:46:03.820]  contraception i mean that is that is 100 against the first amendment and they know it and it's
[1:46:03.820 --> 1:46:08.540]  what all the revolutions in europe were about well they always wanted they want to tame the church
[1:46:08.540 --> 1:46:14.700]  they want to tame religion they want to make it uh heal and do their bidding just like uh that's one
[1:46:14.700 --> 1:46:20.860]  of one of the terrible things when bush started his plan of funding uh so-called faith-based
[1:46:20.860 --> 1:46:25.340]  initiatives funding religious groups terrible terrible thing because of course they would
[1:46:25.340 --> 1:46:29.660]  they do that in order to control them not to help anybody out government is by the way never a
[1:46:29.660 --> 1:46:34.140]  charitable organization they don't when they give out welfare or when they give out subsidies or
[1:46:34.140 --> 1:46:37.900]  whatever not because they want to help people they want to control and of course enrich their
[1:46:37.900 --> 1:46:43.260]  buddies and enrich themselves so but this really this latest religious thing as you can see of
[1:46:43.260 --> 1:46:48.940]  course has had brought about a huge backlash rightly so it's not just contraception it's also
[1:46:48.940 --> 1:46:54.380]  as you mentioned a board of fashions and also sterilization operation and it's forcing and
[1:46:54.380 --> 1:46:59.260]  they're trying to make this crazy distinction between a church and a church hospital or or a
[1:46:59.260 --> 1:47:04.220]  church-run university but these are all religious institutions and they're none of the government's
[1:47:04.220 --> 1:47:10.220]  business and religion is far more powerful than the government by the way so uh my guess is obama
[1:47:10.220 --> 1:47:17.180]  is going to be forced to back down but i hope that this attempt this this all attempt to take over
[1:47:17.180 --> 1:47:22.380]  the church and make it to the government's bidding uh let me ask you a question it's gonna
[1:47:22.380 --> 1:47:26.540]  backfire yeah i agree with you and we're gonna go to calls and then get a comedy a little bit i
[1:47:26.540 --> 1:47:29.580]  wish i got to have you for 10 hours here but i already got to go soon but i want to get some of
[1:47:29.580 --> 1:47:35.820]  these calls clearly you know they're putting muslim extremists in that are killing christians
[1:47:35.820 --> 1:47:39.420]  and they're attacking christianity here in the united states more than any other religion
[1:47:39.420 --> 1:47:46.620]  why does the system worldwide from communist chinese to the soviets to hear why is it christians in
[1:47:46.620 --> 1:47:52.220]  particular that the system is so scared of real christianity not this christianoid new world
[1:47:52.220 --> 1:47:58.220]  order saying they've got going now well because we believe in separation of church and state and
[1:47:58.220 --> 1:48:03.180]  we think that the state that the state has no business control in the church the church would
[1:48:03.180 --> 1:48:07.900]  be an independent realm uh and it none of the government's business just like the family and
[1:48:07.900 --> 1:48:12.780]  business and so many other things christians the only ones who believe in separation of church
[1:48:12.780 --> 1:48:17.980]  and state no other religion believes in that so that's that's why because we think that we're not
[1:48:17.980 --> 1:48:23.660]  a subsidiary of the state we're not an ally of the state we have our you know our own far more
[1:48:23.660 --> 1:48:29.420]  important loyalties than to the the boobs in washington and the criminals in washington
[1:48:29.420 --> 1:48:34.220]  and that's why they hate christianity because we don't we don't believe that there ought to be union
[1:48:34.220 --> 1:48:40.540]  to church and state now now by the way here lou i guarantee we've got listeners out there on over
[1:48:40.540 --> 1:48:47.020]  100 am and fm stations that are going what do you mean it's the liberals it's the globalist
[1:48:47.020 --> 1:48:53.100]  that that was talking about church and state no they've inverted that and in your historian and
[1:48:53.100 --> 1:48:57.660]  actually not an idiot so you know this but a lot of new listeners are like what separates the
[1:48:57.660 --> 1:49:03.580]  church and state that's that bad thing obama uses no no no no it's that the government has no right
[1:49:03.580 --> 1:49:08.300]  in the jurisdiction of religion separation of church and state means the government isn't in
[1:49:08.300 --> 1:49:13.340]  your business but they've inverted it to say separation of church and state means the government
[1:49:13.340 --> 1:49:17.260]  is in the church i mean it's ridiculous of course they always turn everything around
[1:49:17.260 --> 1:49:22.540]  and they're always lying right so just separation of church and state i'll admit that that phrase
[1:49:22.540 --> 1:49:27.260]  can sometimes have unfortunate resonances for some people but we're exactly right what it means
[1:49:27.260 --> 1:49:32.380]  is the government has nothing to say about the church the church is an independent realm and
[1:49:32.380 --> 1:49:37.100]  again like like the businesses and families and communities ought to be independent of the state
[1:49:37.100 --> 1:49:43.820]  too but especially the church um and that that's what that means and whenever you have any kind
[1:49:43.820 --> 1:49:50.060]  of union between as is true say in islamic societies there's no good the state is and the
[1:49:50.060 --> 1:49:56.620]  religion are and you know are entirely in league um that's true in in other other religions too
[1:49:57.340 --> 1:50:02.220]  and i'm not attacking those other religions i'm just saying that's uh this is something about
[1:50:02.220 --> 1:50:07.580]  Christianity that um you know that there are things that belong to God and are none of Caesar's
[1:50:07.580 --> 1:50:12.700]  business this is this is what separation of church and state means so the state stays out of the
[1:50:13.740 --> 1:50:17.980]  the church of the state states like the devil so you don't want the you don't want the devil
[1:50:17.980 --> 1:50:25.100]  involved in the church's business well you're right and again the the deceptions are so ridiculous
[1:50:25.100 --> 1:50:28.620]  and so obvious once you're aware of them we have a new article out that just came out on
[1:50:28.620 --> 1:50:35.260]  prisonplanet.com and info wars.com by Steve Watson Paul campaign we're winning the battle for delegates
[1:50:35.260 --> 1:50:41.100]  GOP strategist predicts Ron Paul will be on the republican ticket and that's why the system is
[1:50:41.100 --> 1:50:46.860]  freaking out now uh coming after Ron Paul because he's going for a strategy for delegates
[1:50:46.860 --> 1:50:52.620]  and Ron Paul has got a statement out saying we are on track and and Ron Paul doesn't put uh you
[1:50:52.620 --> 1:50:57.660]  know perfume on a pig folks if he says that he believes they're on track to be able to force
[1:50:57.660 --> 1:51:03.500]  their way into the nomination and the system is freaking out you know we got to pray for Ron Paul
[1:51:03.500 --> 1:51:07.740]  too now he won't really talk about it on air one time he said well undoubtedly there's a physical
[1:51:07.740 --> 1:51:14.220]  danger but i'm telling you the if he starts to really win uh man i tell you they could really
[1:51:14.220 --> 1:51:19.340]  try something on him physical do you ever worry about that Lou? well sure i do but i i think that
[1:51:19.340 --> 1:51:25.420]  we do need to pray for him and and uh you know he's got good security and uh but absolutely we
[1:51:25.420 --> 1:51:30.700]  should we should pray for his his his victory as well as his well-being and his his continued good
[1:51:30.700 --> 1:51:34.780]  health and by the way i'd love to see that bicep race he talked about having a bicep race with
[1:51:34.780 --> 1:51:40.380]  his other candidates because he's an athlete and he could beat them all Romney and Santorum
[1:51:40.380 --> 1:51:46.300]  and Gingrich Gingrich of course but the rest of them too well we have to just realize the reason
[1:51:46.300 --> 1:51:51.660]  i raised that the type of arena that Ron Paul has stepped into you know we asked him to do this we
[1:51:51.660 --> 1:51:57.660]  demanded him to do this and then people say well his suit's too big or i wish he was younger or he
[1:51:57.660 --> 1:52:02.540]  should have said this folks you're not in the arena Ron Paul is running a race that i couldn't run as
[1:52:02.540 --> 1:52:08.300]  a young man okay so you haven't been there he's in the arena he's doing an incredible job and you
[1:52:08.300 --> 1:52:12.700]  know if he doesn't end up winning folks i don't want to hear a bunch of whining okay we've had
[1:52:12.700 --> 1:52:20.060]  incredible victories don't let yourself uh ever tell yourself that we're not winning when we are
[1:52:20.060 --> 1:52:24.940]  well you know i also there've been times in history when there's when there's been a
[1:52:24.940 --> 1:52:31.260]  revolutionary moment when young people are galvanized by a wise elder by a mentor and
[1:52:32.300 --> 1:52:37.020]  we see this kind of connection between Ron Paul and young people this is revolutionary
[1:52:37.020 --> 1:52:43.100]  and i think the Ron Paul movement is unstoppable ultimately unstoppable i don't know what's
[1:52:43.100 --> 1:52:47.500]  going to happen in terms of politics but intellectually in terms of a social movement
[1:52:47.500 --> 1:52:54.380]  this is the future so that's right absolutely we need to back him contribute to him to tell our
[1:52:54.380 --> 1:52:59.020]  friends about it read actually the best thing you can do for Ron Paul and don't feel like
[1:52:59.020 --> 1:53:05.020]  we're defeated if he doesn't win because again look at him getting 100 200 percent more support
[1:53:05.020 --> 1:53:11.260]  four years later the idea is growing that's what is so dynamic and that's why i've got sources inside
[1:53:11.260 --> 1:53:17.820]  Bilderberg since 2006 they've been scared of Ron Paul scared of the youth scared of the movement
[1:53:18.460 --> 1:53:22.700]  scared of the challenge to their two-party dictatorship let's go to matt in minnesota
[1:53:22.700 --> 1:53:28.300]  here on the air with lou rockwell go ahead hey lou uh i'm a over-the-road truck driver and i've
[1:53:28.300 --> 1:53:33.180]  been noticed they got that transportation bill they want to put more freight on the railways and uh
[1:53:34.380 --> 1:53:39.260]  jones was talking about the fema camps and uh everything's going to be uh on the trains
[1:53:39.260 --> 1:53:45.100]  located near the fema camps and all that and uh i just wanted to see what you the outcome on that
[1:53:45.100 --> 1:53:49.900]  would be if the well let me raise this to lou lou what do you make of it right out of atlas shrugged
[1:53:49.900 --> 1:53:54.860]  where obama shuts down the oil pipeline out of canada and bloomberg reported so that uh
[1:53:55.420 --> 1:54:01.340]  yeah his buddy uh warren buffett could make billions of dollars out of shipping the oil
[1:54:01.340 --> 1:54:07.100]  to the west coast to ships to china i mean that's right out of atlas shrugged and it's typical
[1:54:07.100 --> 1:54:11.820]  right i mean anytime uh when i had the the privilege of working for ron and washington
[1:54:11.820 --> 1:54:14.780]  one of the things that struck me and i'd known this intellectually before but it's
[1:54:14.780 --> 1:54:20.060]  hit me in the face to be there on capitol hill every time and the government does anything
[1:54:20.060 --> 1:54:24.060]  somebody's making a lot of money out of it everything they do no matter what they claim
[1:54:24.060 --> 1:54:27.820]  that they're helping the poor or you know preventing terrorism or whatever people are
[1:54:27.820 --> 1:54:32.540]  making vast dough out of it that's why there's a government so people can rip the rest of us off
[1:54:32.540 --> 1:54:38.620]  and so uh yeah this is this is this is typical it's not this not just began with obama of course
[1:54:38.620 --> 1:54:44.860]  but yeah he's he's enriching his pal uh uh in and his railroads by closing down the pipeline
[1:54:44.860 --> 1:54:49.500]  that's right so unbelievable has buffett stands to make many many billions of dollars
[1:54:49.500 --> 1:54:54.940]  by that decision i mean this is sabotage of our economy it's just it's incredible and the company
[1:54:54.940 --> 1:55:00.540]  that spent hundreds of millions of dollars building it it was more than hundreds of millions i think
[1:55:00.540 --> 1:55:04.860]  the number i saw was almost a billion bucks they're just out of luck finishing it i mean this is
[1:55:04.860 --> 1:55:10.460]  terrorism this is economic terrorism and we let these crooks sit there and do it lauren in texas

[1:55:44.140 --> 1:55:49.100]  everything i've i'm i'm a grunt on the ground on the front lines i'm there fighting the war with
[1:55:49.100 --> 1:55:56.940]  you guys and by analogies mr jones you are the general patent going after the neo-nazi whatever
[1:55:56.940 --> 1:56:04.380]  you got the fascist we need a new word for this that we're in we're making history every minute
[1:56:04.380 --> 1:56:09.820]  of every day the uh i'm always on the verge of tears i'm always on the verge of tearing the
[1:56:09.820 --> 1:56:14.300]  ground up from underneath me and bringing my house down around me well stop right there it's this
[1:56:14.300 --> 1:56:18.780]  type of energy you're responding to evil the way you should lou that's a great point when the
[1:56:18.780 --> 1:56:23.740]  history books are written regardless this is going to be recognized as a great tyranny i mean this
[1:56:23.740 --> 1:56:28.220]  is a great evil this they've launched all these illegal wars killing people they butchered our
[1:56:28.220 --> 1:56:33.420]  bill of rights i mean we're fighting a real tyranny we are fighting a tyranny and i think people are
[1:56:33.420 --> 1:56:38.700]  finally becoming like this gentleman energized they're becoming knowledgeable uh the ron paul
[1:56:38.700 --> 1:56:44.220]  movement is extremely unusual again i think unique in the fact that his followers are readers i mean
[1:56:44.220 --> 1:56:49.260]  they read books they learn they teach themselves they don't just buy what they hear from the mainstream
[1:56:49.260 --> 1:56:55.260]  media in fact they know it's full of lies and they uh they don't count on it they have alternative
[1:56:55.260 --> 1:57:01.900]  sources of information and they're mobilized i would say ron paul's already won for the long
[1:57:01.900 --> 1:57:06.060]  term i don't know what's going to happen at tampa i don't know what's going to happen in november
[1:57:06.060 --> 1:57:11.100]  but for the long term and i happen to think this is far more important than than than elections
[1:57:11.100 --> 1:57:15.820]  for the long term the uh intellectual movement that he started among young people all the young
[1:57:15.820 --> 1:57:22.140]  people he's energized and educated that is where the future is that's why we're going to win uh and
[1:57:22.140 --> 1:57:26.540]  yeah that's why the the establishment is scared to death that right there tells you we're winning
[1:57:27.100 --> 1:57:32.780]  yeah they are they're terrified and uh they're they're frightened i mean we see article after
[1:57:32.780 --> 1:57:37.420]  article about this and i think it's exactly true about uh how scared they are and they're right to
[1:57:37.420 --> 1:57:42.540]  be scared because of everything they do is based on a lie and everything they do is based on theft
[1:57:42.540 --> 1:57:47.340]  everything they do is based on tricking people so when ron paul comes along and says you know the
[1:57:47.340 --> 1:57:52.460]  federal emperor has got no clothes everybody opens their eyes they wait a minute that's right
[1:57:52.460 --> 1:57:57.420]  so he he's already changed so many millions of hearts and minds and not only in this country but

[1:58:02.780 --> 1:58:09.020]  and allied movement is what's going to overturn the tyranny uh this is why i'm optimistic uh despite

[2:00:56.540 --> 2:01:01.180]  rights they just signed a law last year they're going to give your kids shots and morning after pills
[2:01:03.340 --> 2:01:05.900]  small children 10 11 12 year olds
[2:01:05.900 --> 2:01:11.740]  morning after pills that kill people you know the fact that government is going to let these
[2:01:11.740 --> 2:01:17.900]  be in vending machines now and folks it's such a hardcore poison that you take it when you're
[2:01:17.900 --> 2:01:23.820]  pregnant it will kill the baby and then you've got to go through a miscarriage and they tell

[2:01:42.220 --> 2:01:46.780]  but you are going to make the decision but see in california and now the feds are trying to say
[2:01:46.780 --> 2:01:53.820]  yeah give the little kids morning after pills the state even though your child doesn't have consent
[2:01:53.820 --> 2:01:58.380]  informed consent just like you can't give a 12 year old liquor and say well they wanted it
[2:01:59.180 --> 2:02:02.700]  or perverts can't have sex with a 10 year old and say well they wanted it
[2:02:02.700 --> 2:02:06.700]  it they're not adults they can't make that decision
[2:02:08.940 --> 2:02:15.100]  that's called rape you pieces of trash like i'm just going to cover this right now teacher
[2:02:15.100 --> 2:02:20.300]  facing felony for giving student morning after pill police say a high school basketball coach
[2:02:20.300 --> 2:02:23.980]  is facing a felony charge for giving a morning after pill to a student who was worried that
[2:02:23.980 --> 2:02:29.500]  she was pregnant according to an arrest affidavit released today tracy lee steinberg what an idiot

[2:02:52.540 --> 2:02:58.220]  parenthood and got it it was filthy eugenicist she had unprotected sex with her boyfriend the

[2:03:03.980 --> 2:03:08.860]  how many great people are 16 and have a kid it's a blessing but you scum act like it's a horrible
[2:03:08.860 --> 2:03:23.340]  curse you filthy maggot excuse me continuing here um the student did not have a prescription for
[2:03:23.340 --> 2:03:28.300]  the medication which is required for females younger than 17 the student and her boyfriend
[2:03:28.300 --> 2:03:33.180]  then gave steinberg money for the medication the affidavit said you know i want to know why she could
[2:03:33.180 --> 2:03:38.140]  go to plan parenthood at 16 and have that happen they take 12 year olds 9 year olds i've seen some
[2:03:38.140 --> 2:03:43.820]  cases in europe and go and get them but you know for third trimester abortions the state is trying
[2:03:43.820 --> 2:03:48.700]  to take our children over maybe this basketball person's just a moron maybe she doesn't need
[2:03:48.700 --> 2:03:54.300]  life in prison i just get angry about dead babies i guess killing a baby is not a big deal i guess
[2:03:54.300 --> 2:03:58.940]  it's a good thing in america now i'm the extremist i want to apologize i'm being sarcastic
[2:04:01.020 --> 2:04:06.460]  but you see that dichotomy in texas where she's being arrested and indicted and should be
[2:04:08.860 --> 2:04:12.300]  but then in other states they're like yeah we're gonna get mourning after pills the 10 year olds
[2:04:12.300 --> 2:04:23.180]  god help us this is a 16 year old ladies and gentlemen 16 years old and the parents don't
[2:04:23.180 --> 2:04:27.740]  even get to try to influence their daughter not to kill the baby because some teacher made
[2:04:27.740 --> 2:04:31.580]  the decision and thought it was really cute to run off to plan parenthood and get the pill
[2:04:34.060 --> 2:04:39.340]  plan parenthood are nazis they created the nazis but because they're liberal and trendy
[2:04:39.340 --> 2:04:45.100]  all these idiots here in town have fundraisers for them it's just a big money-making scumbag operation
[2:04:46.300 --> 2:04:49.900]  the government claims they take your kid if you spank him even though it's not against the law
[2:04:49.900 --> 2:04:54.140]  but meanwhile they're trying to shove prozac and riddling down your kids and trying to chop them

[2:12:25.420 --> 2:12:30.860]  ron paul is operated by 911 truther they're like he's crazy he thinks there's a world government
[2:12:30.860 --> 2:12:36.060]  he's crazy he thinks the police state's coming i don't know just 30 000 drones army checkpoints tsa
[2:12:36.060 --> 2:12:41.420]  checkpoints in iowa you know just total takeover of society and since i saw it this morning they
[2:12:41.420 --> 2:12:47.420]  found an evil picture of him with ron paul and it you know it gets worse he goes on alex jones' show
[2:12:47.420 --> 2:12:51.820]  and uh he's politically active and they use an interview he did with me where he was talking
[2:12:51.820 --> 2:12:56.860]  about the police state because i was talking about russia if you didn't if you thought the
[2:12:56.860 --> 2:13:02.620]  government was corrupt or changing facts or involved in any type of evil they would grab you
[2:13:02.620 --> 2:13:07.820]  and put you on drugs and you hear this all the time i get emails going you need to be on meds
[2:13:07.820 --> 2:13:14.780]  you know you need to be on meds you're a coward and gary said his parents grabbed him and put him on
[2:13:14.780 --> 2:13:18.940]  you know drugs like they do a lot of kids oh your son's raising his hand too much your son's getting
[2:13:18.940 --> 2:13:23.900]  in fights on the playground put him on deadly drugs 20 of our population that are kids are on drugs
[2:13:23.900 --> 2:13:30.300]  so the idea is he's crazy too oh his parents were reasonable you know yeah there's no police state
[2:13:30.300 --> 2:13:35.180]  but if you think things we don't like we're gonna drug you and man now he's 30 something years old
[2:13:35.180 --> 2:13:39.580]  having an effect that it's just terrible and yeah he thinks they're setting up a world government
[2:13:39.580 --> 2:13:46.540]  even though the un called for it last week it doesn't work anymore that's why ms nbc has almost no
[2:13:46.540 --> 2:13:52.780]  viewers they have their biggest shows have a half million to 900 000 viewers their average show has
[2:13:52.780 --> 2:14:01.660]  about 100 000 viewers go look at info wars.com next to msnbc.com on alexa we've got over over
[2:14:01.660 --> 2:14:08.220]  it's like 14 times the traffic depending on which month you look at i mean they're a joke they're a
[2:14:08.220 --> 2:14:13.820]  joke they're a joke and now they're calling for web censorship and supporting sopa because they
[2:14:13.820 --> 2:14:18.940]  don't like drugs they don't like info wars they're scum and they know it i don't sit up here in a
[2:14:18.940 --> 2:14:23.900]  perfect suit acting all authoritative and going on reading all the teleprompter like i'm telling you
[2:14:23.900 --> 2:14:30.060]  absolute veritas they hate it that we're just bare knuckles in there smashing their guts out
[2:14:30.060 --> 2:14:35.020]  kicking their hind ends in the info war we're gonna go on doing it murdering drug dealing scum
[2:14:35.020 --> 2:14:39.900]  and media that defends it and msnbc that gets banger bailout money now joining us from his tv
[2:14:39.900 --> 2:14:45.660]  studios is the evil one gary franchi and his wicked super PAC they are really getting scared
[2:14:45.660 --> 2:14:51.100]  of ron paul and his delegate program to not try to win states but get enough delegates to win
[2:14:51.100 --> 2:14:55.980]  and they don't like this stratagem uh and they're very upset about it they're gonna pull out all
[2:14:55.980 --> 2:15:01.020]  the stops gary but i think it's backfiring when they go ron paul said oklahoma city was an inside
[2:15:01.020 --> 2:15:08.060]  job he's bad that only gets him more support gary alex thanks for having me on uh my question is
[2:15:08.060 --> 2:15:12.860]  what took him so long to uh look at my youtube channel and look at my websites i've been running
[2:15:12.860 --> 2:15:17.500]  this pack for months when now they decide to come out and do this you know they're a little behind
[2:15:17.500 --> 2:15:22.700]  the curve uh and that's why they're losing the battle for the info war that's why we're winning
[2:15:22.700 --> 2:15:27.900]  uh that you know alex we are directly over the target we're taking flak uh it's because we're
[2:15:27.900 --> 2:15:34.380]  we're winning i mean look i i put out a press release 48 hours ago stating that we are going
[2:15:34.380 --> 2:15:40.060]  to put exit pollers in states across the country to verify the fraud that's taking place oh i forgot
[2:15:40.060 --> 2:15:44.940]  i got interrupted i forgot they're so transparent they're like francy is going to prove the election
[2:15:44.940 --> 2:15:53.180]  fraud oh my gosh shut him down uh i'm exactly they go ahead and so you know we've got that
[2:15:53.180 --> 2:15:59.340]  action in place you know we're doing broadcast we have a we have a live media boycott mainstream
[2:15:59.340 --> 2:16:05.100]  media boycott in effect right now and instead of watching the primary returns that the mainstream
[2:16:05.100 --> 2:16:11.260]  media is is providing skewed results we're doing it right here from our studio's life our first
[2:16:11.260 --> 2:16:17.660]  broadcast else with 20 000 people tune in to boycott the mainstream media so we're poking we're poking
[2:16:17.660 --> 2:16:22.380]  at the beast and we're having an effect and they decide to come out and just do these smear tactics
[2:16:22.380 --> 2:16:27.980]  i'm actually honored that a Pulitzer prize-winning journalist would take the time to look into my
[2:16:27.980 --> 2:16:32.380]  my life and and the work yeah but uh he's Pulitzer prize winner because he's a globalist but
[2:16:32.380 --> 2:16:38.780]  the whore stream trader stream sympathizer to the new world order uh Nazi scumbag new world order
[2:16:38.780 --> 2:16:45.100]  trash uh prostitute uh sewer stream media i mean they're bleeding out here and they're and you're
[2:16:45.100 --> 2:16:48.460]  right they're coming after you because they're scared of that exit polling we're in when four
[2:16:48.460 --> 2:16:53.580]  percent of precincts were reporting they announced romney the winner even though poll showed he
[2:16:53.580 --> 2:16:57.580]  shouldn't have been the winner in nevada i mean we've proven the fraud went on we just don't know
[2:16:57.580 --> 2:17:03.420]  the details uh in iowa they're a bunch of scum well when you look at the the upward trend it's
[2:17:03.420 --> 2:17:09.180]  taking place right now every single state that has held a primary or a caucus ron paul is
[2:17:10.540 --> 2:17:15.340]  his support has grown so much and then when you look at the graph for nevada you're like wait a
[2:17:15.340 --> 2:17:21.260]  minute only a hundred extra people voted for ron paul yeah it's statistically exactly as it was
[2:17:21.260 --> 2:17:26.380]  four years ago though he's gotten a hundred percent two hundred percent in every other area it's
[2:17:26.380 --> 2:17:31.260]  always above a hundred there it's they use the same program they used last year or four years ago
[2:17:31.260 --> 2:17:36.940]  i also want to point out that my father and my mother they are my biggest supporters right now
[2:17:36.940 --> 2:17:41.260]  you know years ago when when i was running around telling people that there's a new world order and
[2:17:41.260 --> 2:17:46.860]  they're going to microchip people you know i i didn't i didn't understand completely what was what
[2:17:46.860 --> 2:17:51.580]  was taking place and sure they want to shut me up they want to put me on drugs and they want they
[2:17:51.580 --> 2:17:56.300]  want me to go and get a 40-hour-a-week job they want to pay my taxes and they want me to just be a
[2:17:56.300 --> 2:18:02.460]  submissive little slave in their system and i said no not anymore i'm going to investigate i'm

[2:25:24.460 --> 2:25:29.980]  if you're a radio listener i will get curtain ammo uh to post as the image of the day down at
[2:25:29.980 --> 2:25:36.220]  the bottom of info wars dot com janet dung beetle napolitano and i think when we address her again
[2:25:36.220 --> 2:25:43.260]  words or weapons and she deserves it she is janet dung beetle napolitano janet dung beetle
[2:25:43.260 --> 2:25:49.820]  napolitano and as far as i'm concerned they're all a bunch of dung beetles janet rino uh kagan
[2:25:50.460 --> 2:25:56.700]  um and they all they're all look like they come from the same vat of dung beetles so uh that's
[2:25:56.700 --> 2:26:02.380]  their new name well what do you think gary the dung beetle media they roll around big piles of you
[2:26:02.380 --> 2:26:08.700]  know what it on people i'm sorry but well you know they're all in bed with each other and uh it's
[2:26:08.700 --> 2:26:14.140]  a lot there is a lot of inbreeding in the media which i have to say though we we did put out a
[2:26:14.140 --> 2:26:22.540]  call for a cnn's dana bash to be reassigned and uh she caught a lot of flak after she was
[2:26:22.540 --> 2:26:27.100]  basically saying that dana dung beetle bash yeah she didn't want to see ron paul succeed
[2:26:27.100 --> 2:26:32.460]  she said it live on the air she's she's biasing in her reports we put out a call and she got
[2:26:32.460 --> 2:26:37.500]  reassigned to the santorum campaign because she couldn't do her work i mean look we're having an
[2:26:37.500 --> 2:26:42.700]  impact alex they're freaking out that they're trying everything in the book but the point of the
[2:26:42.700 --> 2:26:48.380]  matter is that you know what dung beetles eat i don't want to know else anyway well that's what
[2:26:48.380 --> 2:26:52.620]  that's what all of them eat i'm sorry i'm i'm not a control today i'm so angry i'm not being like
[2:26:52.620 --> 2:26:57.180]  a child i apologize i'll stop it so so we got a few minutes left gary you're awesome and again
[2:26:57.180 --> 2:27:02.860]  they're attacking you because they're scared yeah they look like i said i'm i'm surprised it took
[2:27:02.860 --> 2:27:08.300]  them this long to figure it out uh it's but it's because we are over the target we are going to
[2:27:08.300 --> 2:27:14.460]  be doing exit polling uh we are doing alternative broadcasts to combat their biased reporting
[2:27:15.100 --> 2:27:21.420]  and this is what needs to be done to win the election for ron paul i am look my opinions
[2:27:21.420 --> 2:27:27.260]  do not necessarily reflect ron paul i have to say that because i'm an individual i support ron paul
[2:27:27.260 --> 2:27:31.740]  and his constitutional fight for the white house and that's it that's why i formed the super pack
[2:27:31.740 --> 2:27:37.740]  so we could so we could go ahead and and support those matters so i mean that mainstream media
[2:27:37.740 --> 2:27:42.140]  wants to come out and try and paint me in low lantern society and and all the things i've done
[2:27:42.140 --> 2:27:48.460]  in the past you know let them try bring it on i i love it uh look they even they highlighted camp
[2:27:48.460 --> 2:27:54.620]  fema they put my trailer to their move to my movie that you're in in that article i i hope we get
[2:27:54.620 --> 2:27:59.100]  some more sales out of it i appreciate that oh yeah they act like we're bad for pointing out
[2:27:59.100 --> 2:28:04.860]  they're setting up a domestic security force to spy on people when it's all admitted yeah the the
[2:28:04.860 --> 2:28:10.300]  documentations there uh you know they they try to downplay it but you know we're we're putting
[2:28:10.300 --> 2:28:15.420]  a spotlight on it alex they're running like cockroaches by the way speaking of cockroaches
[2:28:15.420 --> 2:28:23.740]  we actually have some footage live the anonymous is hacked in uh to uh a national security meeting
[2:28:23.740 --> 2:28:31.180]  right now and we've got janet apolitano janet rino anilina kegan and others and and hillary uh
[2:28:31.180 --> 2:28:37.500]  we have caught footage of all of them uh in a homeland security meeting and uh they're they're
[2:28:37.500 --> 2:28:42.620]  actually having a feast at the meeting so uh this is some amazing footage we're showing it's
[2:28:42.620 --> 2:28:49.820]  actually dung beetles rolling piles of you know what all right that's enough gary you're doing a

[2:34:44.780 --> 2:34:50.220]  something well that's exactly what they do it's you know it's there they are the uh...
[2:34:50.220 --> 2:34:56.380]  the spin masters attempting to slander using name calling in fact when i had replied to
[2:34:56.380 --> 2:35:02.940]  deadman in my email i told him i said you know i don't i'm not somebody who likes labels i'm not
[2:35:02.940 --> 2:35:08.780]  someone who likes to to put people in a box and try to and try to separate them from the masses
[2:35:08.780 --> 2:35:12.700]  and i told him i think that's a major problem that we have in this country today and of course
[2:35:12.700 --> 2:35:17.260]  what does it do in the headline he puts me in a box and labels me and then he there's some
[2:35:17.260 --> 2:35:22.940]  exchange between me and him about the southern poverty law center i told him look i am proud
[2:35:22.940 --> 2:35:29.180]  to be listed on the southern poverty law center's website alongside ron paul alex jones and alike
[2:35:29.180 --> 2:35:33.420]  because you know what because we're doing great work oh yeah they act like all the southern
[2:35:33.420 --> 2:35:39.580]  poverty law center a discredited you know federal hit group says you're extreme like they control
[2:35:39.580 --> 2:35:46.540]  reality yeah and so with that being said they he did his best and you know whatever
[2:35:47.340 --> 2:35:52.860]  look what we're taking over the signal alex that like i said before this is the dying breath of
[2:35:52.860 --> 2:35:56.700]  the mainstream media and we're going to win this thing we're going to take it all the way
[2:35:56.700 --> 2:36:02.060]  and winner lose we're winning alex winner lose we are winning they can put out as many
[2:36:02.060 --> 2:36:08.060]  hit pieces as they want bring it on promote well i told politico a few years ago when the
[2:36:08.060 --> 2:36:12.620]  both political parties were attacking rand paul and i said don't you get it the more you attack
[2:36:12.620 --> 2:36:17.660]  him the higher his ratings go then bill clinton went to town and and and attacking he got six
[2:36:17.660 --> 2:36:24.540]  points or more expanding his margin of victory like sixteen points i said you're out of bullets
[2:36:24.540 --> 2:36:29.820]  the only way to defeat rand paul is for you to endorse him because you're so discredited don't
[2:36:29.820 --> 2:36:35.180]  you get it well i'm getting phone calls from family and friends today people opening up their
[2:36:35.180 --> 2:36:42.060]  email box and seeing my name in their you know msn dot com hotmail accounts so all this does is is
[2:36:42.060 --> 2:36:47.020]  further elevate me to a national level and people are going to start looking into the work that i'm
[2:36:47.020 --> 2:36:52.540]  doing and i hope that they will find some information that's going to cause them to ask questions to
[2:36:52.540 --> 2:36:58.380]  investigate the facts further i mean this only helps the cause alex no it does every time they
[2:36:58.380 --> 2:37:03.580]  demonize us and say don't watch camp fema it's crazy they say the government's you know training

[2:37:49.340 --> 2:37:50.460]  fema camp story
[2:37:50.460 --> 2:38:04.700]  uh folks we are kicking the new world order's teeth in but they're counter striking by controlling
[2:38:04.700 --> 2:38:12.700]  the infrastructure with a whole cornucopia a constellation a cocktail uh with a stratagem
[2:38:12.700 --> 2:38:21.660]  to begin to shut down free speech so it is absolutely essential to start getting the word out now
[2:38:22.220 --> 2:38:29.020]  and to use twitter facebook youtube and info wars dot com and prison planet dot com the
[2:38:29.020 --> 2:38:34.380]  information on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com it's time to use the twitter the facebook
[2:38:34.380 --> 2:38:41.500]  to youtube as conduits to get this information out to everybody the system isn't openly trying
[2:38:41.500 --> 2:38:46.060]  to sell web censorship i mean i read these articles every day twitter agrees the total
[2:38:46.060 --> 2:38:51.260]  censorship whenever the government asks uh facebook agrees to it youtube agrees to it
[2:38:51.980 --> 2:38:58.140]  in england they admit they're about to pass regulations to restrict the web canada the us
[2:39:01.020 --> 2:39:06.940]  i've got all these articles out today where the system admits they're doing this i mean we've got
[2:39:06.940 --> 2:39:16.220]  an article at info wars dot com that is so huge dhs to launch insurgent tracking drones inside
[2:39:16.220 --> 2:39:25.180]  america 30 000 of them in their words to track insurgents as if they need 30 000 drones for all
[2:39:25.180 --> 2:39:31.900]  the al qaeda who they work with and give control of libya i mean it's just bonkers it's for us
[2:39:31.900 --> 2:39:36.860]  it's always been for us and now they're in the news saying it's for right wingers it's for gun
[2:39:36.860 --> 2:39:43.420]  owners it's for anti-war people it's for amish it's for rural communities anybody that doesn't
[2:39:44.060 --> 2:39:50.140]  want to be a slave of the system they it's a corporate takeover of every facet of society
[2:39:53.660 --> 2:40:02.620]  now on this subject of femacamps in america curt nemo did a blurb on this but i'm gonna have him
[2:40:02.620 --> 2:40:08.620]  uh such a great prolific researcher and writer add more to this story because last night this
[2:40:08.620 --> 2:40:14.940]  information came in from a source that's given us info before that's been accurate and uh it was like
[2:40:16.620 --> 2:40:23.020]  nine o'clock at night and i at least wanted to be able to kiss my children on the forehead even
[2:40:23.020 --> 2:40:27.180]  though they were already asleep so i got home about 10 so i spent about 30 minutes on the phone
[2:40:27.180 --> 2:40:31.660]  with this fella did some checking uh with some satellite photo stuff through google and other
[2:40:31.660 --> 2:40:36.780]  systems and checked it with some other sources and checked it with a civilian inmate labor camp
[2:40:36.780 --> 2:40:42.700]  program and did confirm this is one of the training centers for that and that indeed uh the photos he
[2:40:42.700 --> 2:40:48.220]  sent us were accurate and again we're going to get more photos and post them uh once we can be sure
[2:40:48.220 --> 2:40:53.980]  that it doesn't reveal who our sources are but i can't tell you it's multiple sources military and
[2:40:53.980 --> 2:40:59.740]  others and they're pretty freaked out but let's be clear the federal government and i've played
[2:40:59.740 --> 2:41:06.060]  the clips has said india will kill citizens without warrants or even arrest no one will ever know where
[2:41:06.060 --> 2:41:11.740]  you went will put you in black sites it was in the news yesterday that in europe and iraq a headline
[2:41:11.740 --> 2:41:17.580]  london guardian more secret prisons found in fact put that in let's show folks that more secret
[2:41:17.580 --> 2:41:25.100]  prisons torture sites in romania torture sites in egypt torture sites in iraq and you've got
[2:41:25.100 --> 2:41:29.820]  lindsay graham saying of a citizen asked for a lawyer we say shut up you don't get one and then
[2:41:29.820 --> 2:41:37.100]  we cut in the video to the same debate and creepy uh laborman says we want americans to be scared
[2:41:37.100 --> 2:41:42.220]  we don't want you to know how we torture you i mean this is jeffrey dommer stuff in your face
[2:41:42.220 --> 2:41:47.260]  they need to do it openly so that everybody just thinks the crime is okay because an authority
[2:41:47.260 --> 2:41:52.140]  figure is doing it openly this is how tyrants do it just like it comes out the troops are growing
[2:41:52.140 --> 2:41:58.140]  opium the troops are getting upset they just have fox cnn bbc abc news all admit the troops are
[2:41:58.140 --> 2:42:03.580]  ordered to grow the opium in afghanistan and the troops are all made to stand around the news going
[2:42:03.580 --> 2:42:07.420]  yeah we don't like it what why are we on tv well because it's okay what you're doing
[2:42:08.300 --> 2:42:13.580]  heraldo says thank you for standing up for america yeah there it is raf helicopter death
[2:42:13.580 --> 2:42:18.380]  revelation leads to secret iraq detention camp they've got them all over the place read the
[2:42:18.380 --> 2:42:23.900]  army's reports will they torture you will they try to arrest you i don't know does the army's own
[2:42:23.900 --> 2:42:28.780]  report say that they rape children i mean i go read it you can't make this up with acid
[2:42:29.980 --> 2:42:36.540]  go read it just type in abu gaib army abuse report they call it abuse killing people beating
[2:42:36.540 --> 2:42:42.060]  people to death this is what we signed on to abortions it's just a procedure torturing a
[2:42:42.060 --> 2:42:47.100]  five-year-old kid it's just a procedure george bush saying he ordered torture in a book last year
[2:42:47.100 --> 2:42:51.660]  would order it again well why when your guys got caught doing it just send some to prison because
[2:42:51.660 --> 2:42:57.500]  it was illegal they tried to get laws passed saying they could torture they couldn't do that folks
[2:42:58.300 --> 2:43:03.340]  folks these are criminals openly saying they order torture because they like it now i'm
[2:43:03.340 --> 2:43:06.780]  going to go to our guests in this segment until the end of the show they'd be going i'll go into
[2:43:06.780 --> 2:43:10.220]  overdrive to to take some calls i gotta get to your calls i want to take your calls it's just
[2:43:10.220 --> 2:43:15.660]  there's so much info now they admit they've built emergency centers for civil unrest the john war
[2:43:15.660 --> 2:43:20.540]  defense authorization act they have the emergency centers establishment act that just admits what
[2:43:20.540 --> 2:43:24.780]  we already know has been built at old military bases you have the civilian and made labor camp
[2:43:24.780 --> 2:43:30.860]  program operating since the 70s declassified in 1996 i mean i'm giving you all the names
[2:43:30.860 --> 2:43:38.140]  you can go to department of defense websites and look this all up but talking to these guys what's
[2:43:38.140 --> 2:43:43.500]  creepy is is that they bug their eyes out at the workers at the base the foreign troop trainers
[2:43:43.500 --> 2:43:49.500]  that are training them in torture and riot control and all the rest of it they bug their eyes out
[2:43:49.500 --> 2:43:54.380]  at everybody and it's this attitude that criminals have of trying to intimidate everybody because
[2:43:54.380 --> 2:44:00.060]  they know what they're doing is super illegal at this base okay and we're going to break it down with
[2:44:00.060 --> 2:44:05.420]  our guests but the point is the killing of americans the camps the torture it's all out in the open
[2:44:05.420 --> 2:44:10.780]  so you can't deny these camps are there because they admit that they are setting them up they just
[2:44:10.780 --> 2:44:14.940]  don't want you to know where they are or the details because there's something about physically
[2:44:14.940 --> 2:44:24.140]  seeing it now again if you go to info wars.com source exposes fema training camp in missouri
[2:44:24.140 --> 2:44:31.100]  and it's training area 166 camp charlie mock internment facility that's what it is it's a
[2:44:31.100 --> 2:44:36.140]  little abu graib and they're building they're expanding and it's a big base we're going to tell

[2:44:55.580 --> 2:45:00.540]  you got the floor till we go to break tell everybody what you can about this facility
[2:45:00.540 --> 2:45:07.660]  and the the beefing up of security and everything that's going on there right now okay um basically
[2:45:07.660 --> 2:45:13.740]  well it's fort lennard wood missouri and um basically what's going on there is uh you know
[2:45:13.740 --> 2:45:18.220]  it's where they train all the mps and they've always trained them there this is they train the
[2:45:18.220 --> 2:45:26.380]  mps for all of the military that's navy or force army marine um and actually right about the same
[2:45:26.380 --> 2:45:33.900]  time as those kbr documents got released and the ndaa went through um that's an influx in military
[2:45:33.900 --> 2:45:38.860]  police training going on right now and that's actually the word on the base um is that uh
[2:45:38.860 --> 2:45:46.380]  they're recruiting more mps now than they would infantry or say any other uh branch of the army so
[2:45:47.020 --> 2:45:51.580]  for some reason or another they're training a lot more mps they're training them on mob tactics
[2:45:51.580 --> 2:45:56.700]  um and that's what they call them to is mob control so they don't want them to have a
[2:45:56.700 --> 2:46:02.060]  face like it's not a certain group that they're going after it's just mom and then i also overheard
[2:46:02.060 --> 2:46:07.660]  a comment of one of the trainees uh saying well wouldn't that whole be more aggressive or would
[2:46:07.660 --> 2:46:13.420]  be better on a man and he said not a woman or a man at this subject so you can kind of get the
[2:46:13.420 --> 2:46:21.500]  feel of what's going on there uh continued again it's fort lennard wood that's a typo in the article
[2:46:21.500 --> 2:46:27.180]  we turn out so much info that key things we seem to get wrong um that's not info worse fault that's
[2:46:27.180 --> 2:46:31.340]  us writing it up last night giving it to curt like idiots but i know it's fort lennard wood i
[2:46:31.340 --> 2:46:35.660]  was reading it myself going why is that wrong so we'll get we'll get the google maps photos up and
[2:46:35.660 --> 2:46:41.180]  get everything uh added to that but uh please continue yeah uh uh with the base and the rest of
[2:46:41.180 --> 2:46:45.740]  it okay well if you go into the base off the windmill entrance which is a town right at the
[2:46:45.740 --> 2:46:51.340]  south side of the post that and you turn right on indiana you take indiana until a hard corner
[2:46:51.340 --> 2:46:56.300]  which where it turns into south dakota avenue and right there on that corner is where the camp is
[2:46:57.020 --> 2:47:01.180]  um and it's just a training facility but it's a lot bigger than what the picture showed we
[2:47:01.180 --> 2:47:08.140]  we got more but we took 15 photos and only two of them came out so um early as all i can say is
[2:47:08.140 --> 2:47:16.380]  it's definitely creepy there's a lot of security uh and uh you know it's just nerve-wracking for sure
[2:47:18.860 --> 2:47:25.980]  only other thing i could say too is um if you look at the mp m os it was expanded with the
[2:47:25.980 --> 2:47:32.620]  ndaa and it was expanded because the prison the the camps will be ran by eight mp's basically is
[2:47:32.620 --> 2:47:42.540]  what i what i uh what i get back so okay continue sir continue breaking down the the
[2:47:42.540 --> 2:47:48.700]  because you made a lot of other points last night yeah um well you know uh there was about
[2:47:48.700 --> 2:47:53.900]  a hundred soldiers out there training and um they were training in baton tactics which would be
[2:47:53.900 --> 2:48:03.100]  like a night thick and um uh yeah they were being led by a uh a guy in a purple uniform uh my assumption
[2:48:03.100 --> 2:48:08.540]  is it's foreign military i couldn't tell you uh but just the attitude that they all had when
[2:48:08.540 --> 2:48:14.620]  they're training and it's it's definitely going to be for women and men and hopefully no children
[2:48:14.620 --> 2:48:22.780]  but you know you got to just assume the worst now expanding on this because i know you don't want
[2:48:22.780 --> 2:48:26.780]  to give up one of your sources but you were saying that your source on the base is saying that was a
[2:48:26.780 --> 2:48:32.060]  foreign trainer uh but specifically what about these buildings with barbed wire around them
[2:48:32.060 --> 2:48:36.220]  facing both directions with the barbed wire facing both directions on the outside yeah it's
[2:48:36.220 --> 2:48:40.700]  really weird because each little containment building has barbed wire on it which at the top
[2:48:40.700 --> 2:48:46.220]  of the fence you know it's a eight foot fence and at the top of it it has barbed wire facing
[2:48:46.220 --> 2:48:51.580]  both directions and then there's little pathways like cattle uh cattle chambers where they would
[2:48:51.580 --> 2:48:57.820]  like prod people through and they it almost reminds me of an old-time farm with uh padlocks on it you
[2:48:57.820 --> 2:49:02.300]  know where you would let your animals graze over here for a little bit and then when they ate the
[2:49:02.300 --> 2:49:07.180]  grass down you would open that gate up and push them into the next pad and so on and so forth but
[2:49:07.180 --> 2:49:11.740]  yeah so there's a fence around the whole thing with barbed wire both directions at the top and
[2:49:11.740 --> 2:49:17.580]  then every single little containment our confinement facility has barbed wire around it too so and
[2:49:17.580 --> 2:49:25.260]  then you know there's a guard tower every hundred feet it seems like but this is just this the pictures
[2:49:25.260 --> 2:49:31.020]  only show the training facility and there's even a bigger prison building that's concrete that's
[2:49:31.020 --> 2:49:37.420]  part of that training facility with bars and everything but you know there is there is actual
[2:49:37.420 --> 2:49:43.420]  camp and in the area you know we have three in Missouri so that's the one that you're seeing
[2:49:43.420 --> 2:49:49.420]  on the pictures is for the training well i mean it's admitted that they have the civilian m8 labor
[2:49:49.420 --> 2:49:54.860]  camp program where the army runs federal and state prisoners that then that was secret for decades
[2:49:54.860 --> 2:50:00.300]  so so this been secret programs they got rex 84 all of this but uh you were telling me though
[2:50:00.300 --> 2:50:04.860]  there's a lot more action there's construction going on what are they doing there at the base
[2:50:04.860 --> 2:50:11.100]  oh yeah just like you said there it's it's going to be a hub i believe a big hub for training
[2:50:11.100 --> 2:50:17.820]  just as it always has been with the mps you know and if you talk to soldiers that came from a battle
[2:50:17.820 --> 2:50:23.420]  zone you know most of the work on an occupation anyway like in iraq for instance most of the
[2:50:23.420 --> 2:50:29.660]  groundwork was done by mps so um but yeah they're training mps for home it's the way it feels to me
[2:50:29.660 --> 2:50:36.540]  another thing that i wanted to bring up too is if you just do a word search on internment and
[2:50:36.540 --> 2:50:41.980]  uh look up what that means it's either for to confine prisoners of war intern or confine
[2:50:41.980 --> 2:50:46.300]  prisoners of war or suspected terrorists that's the definition so well they're doing massive
[2:50:46.300 --> 2:50:52.060]  hiring everywhere they've got giant contracts with halliburton uh running them here in the us
[2:50:52.060 --> 2:50:57.340]  it's a massive hiring program hundreds of millions of dollars just to do the training yeah i know i
[2:50:57.340 --> 2:51:06.060]  thought i fell out crowning room has the contract has the united states been discovered in the bible
[2:51:06.060 --> 2:51:12.940]  where does islam fit in bible prophecy is the new world order world government these and other

[2:54:20.780 --> 2:54:25.020]  article we have a link to fort lindard wood i knew when i was reading and i was like that's a
[2:54:25.020 --> 2:54:31.260]  typo fort you know lindard but uh there it is and he's got links to all the government documents
[2:54:31.260 --> 2:54:37.100]  and past big breakdowns we've done but they admit they say they'll have the military arrest us
[2:54:37.100 --> 2:54:44.140]  they'll kill us and you did tell me some other stuff you haven't gotten to uh on air and it might
[2:54:44.140 --> 2:54:49.980]  be interesting to actually talk to your friend but um just describing how they're mean to everybody
[2:54:49.980 --> 2:54:56.860]  they bug their eyes out at you they flip out on people and you were saying that uh it wasn't like
[2:54:56.860 --> 2:55:01.420]  this in the past and that they're well i mean they're acting pretty suspicious oh yeah for sure
[2:55:01.420 --> 2:55:07.660]  it used to be an open post used to be able to just drive on to the post um but um yeah now you can't
[2:55:07.660 --> 2:55:11.580]  so they're gonna they're gonna ask you what you're doing it it's like you're leaving the country
[2:55:11.580 --> 2:55:16.780]  when you drive on to that place so or if you're coming back to the country i should say um and
[2:55:16.780 --> 2:55:21.420]  then and you know uh there are some there is some information i could give you but i i just can't
[2:55:21.420 --> 2:55:26.220]  because it was just in point who it wouldn't be a good thing but i would we do want to get
[2:55:26.220 --> 2:55:30.300]  you some more photo more videos because you haven't seen anything yet if you think well we
[2:55:30.300 --> 2:55:33.580]  everybody can drive over there right now in videotape but i don't think we should be so scared
[2:55:33.580 --> 2:55:38.380]  of these people i know you guys are involved so you can't be known and that's why you're aware of
[2:55:38.380 --> 2:55:44.460]  this uh well yeah and you can't just get on the base that's the thing but oh those photos are
[2:55:44.460 --> 2:55:50.700]  actually on the base yeah and with all the recent legislation and everything you know we're just
[2:55:50.700 --> 2:55:56.380]  we're just concerned about our tax dollars the constitution in our country so well look these
[2:55:56.380 --> 2:56:01.820]  are criminals okay the military is full of good people but but it's illegal to say they can kill
[2:56:01.820 --> 2:56:06.460]  citizens and secretly arrest us and put us in camps hey i'm with you they may pass laws all
[2:56:06.460 --> 2:56:12.860]  day saying it hitler passed laws saying that he was still hitler right right and you know and
[2:56:12.860 --> 2:56:16.460]  well you you kind of understand where i'm coming from because i remember the other day on here so
[2:56:16.460 --> 2:56:21.980]  you said look i got video cameras recording my house 24-7 if they think they're gonna come in
[2:56:21.980 --> 2:56:28.380]  somebody's gonna see it but i don't have that luxury i wish i did um but yeah we we all need to get
[2:56:28.380 --> 2:56:33.820]  together we all need to stand strong uh we need to get Ron Paul in office um we need well people
[2:56:33.820 --> 2:56:39.900]  that are serving this system need to ask themselves how did it get this far i mean now they admit it's
[2:56:39.900 --> 2:56:44.140]  for the american people it didn't for al-qaeda they now admit al-qaeda works for the criminals that run
[2:56:44.140 --> 2:56:49.260]  our government i mean will you just do anything these criminals say and the answer is no the vast
[2:56:49.260 --> 2:56:54.780]  majority of police and military have said no the problem is as you know the military goes through
[2:56:55.420 --> 2:57:01.100]  and gets the people that will follow the orders they go and test them and they pull them out
[2:57:01.100 --> 2:57:07.020]  and create cadres of those folks you're absolutely right and and you can bet on it that the military
[2:57:07.020 --> 2:57:13.020]  police will be our police on the street in this country so you can bet on it sir 12 years ago
[2:57:13.020 --> 2:57:17.500]  they would have the mps in san antonio from the air force bases out arresting people
[2:57:17.500 --> 2:57:23.020]  now it's everywhere i see newscast every week all over the country where you just pull up and
[2:57:23.020 --> 2:57:29.100]  there's mps with machine guns dragging people out of cars marines with barrettos on their sides
[2:57:29.100 --> 2:57:34.700]  and and they go oh we're doing a dwi check so the checkpoint's illegal and it's troops i mean it's
[2:57:34.700 --> 2:57:40.700]  just full out criminality it truly is and we're going to keep trying to uncover it every corner
[2:57:40.700 --> 2:57:47.420]  that we can and you'll always be our first contact um long time listener prison planet tv member
[2:57:47.420 --> 2:57:53.180]  ron paul supporter uh i support the constitution basically you're a terrorist yeah pretty much and
[2:57:53.180 --> 2:57:56.780]  you know it's a sad thing too i had to go to a republican meeting here the other day just so
[2:57:56.780 --> 2:58:02.220]  they let me vote when the caucus comes to missouri and march 17th and that's another joke too we had
[2:58:02.220 --> 2:58:07.900]  the primary here uh two days ago and it didn't count because it was scheduled too early but
[2:58:07.900 --> 2:58:11.980]  they spent ten million dollars to go ahead and hold the primary which it didn't count but they
[2:58:11.980 --> 2:58:15.660]  on the news it shows that form got all the delegates which they haven't even given out yet
[2:58:15.660 --> 2:58:20.940]  because march 17th is i know it's all pure fraud it's just total criminality i mean that's why

[3:01:21.020 --> 3:01:26.380]  of all the f-16s here at the base and going to complete drones oh no there will be no fighter
[3:01:27.100 --> 3:01:31.020]  craft or ground soldiers it'll all be robots controlled by the globalist that's what they
[3:01:31.020 --> 3:01:38.700]  wanted to humanize is the killing and the robots won't say no well i had uh uh called into a show
[3:01:38.700 --> 3:01:44.860]  today to discuss that but they were talking about fema camps uh this is a local iowa iowa show
[3:01:44.860 --> 3:01:49.820]  they were talking about camps when they were uh the the host was kind of railroad and this lady
[3:01:49.820 --> 3:01:55.900]  that was going around and talking about uh being uh locked up for two and a half years in a camp
[3:01:55.900 --> 3:02:04.700]  you know in the 40s when we were at war with uh the nazis and in uh japan and he was he was talking
[3:02:04.700 --> 3:02:10.300]  about how that was bad and but then he turned around and said that it was because we were fighting
[3:02:10.300 --> 3:02:15.420]  liberty or fighting tyranny that we had to do it and well i didn't really understand what he was
[3:02:15.420 --> 3:02:21.020]  talking about uh because it just basically talked himself into a circle but so he was on the air
[3:02:21.020 --> 3:02:25.900]  though had a little fema camp discussion hmm yeah that was just this morning so it's kind of ironic
[3:02:25.900 --> 3:02:30.860]  that gary franche was on today basically what happened was i popped in my camp fema and took
[3:02:30.860 --> 3:02:36.300]  some quick notes off the beginning of it and and you know told him i'm like this is this is you know
[3:02:36.300 --> 3:02:40.540]  this is not about racism this is about civil liberties and we shouldn't be doing this to anybody
[3:02:40.540 --> 3:02:47.260]  and uh you know he basically talked me off air after the show was over he kept me at the very end
[3:02:47.260 --> 3:02:51.020]  and and talked me about it but we didn't really have a lot of time to go into it on the air so
[3:02:51.020 --> 3:02:56.140]  i didn't really get to make my point but uh i was kind of confused because you know a big thing
[3:02:56.140 --> 3:03:01.900]  like that should be in the news and and the demorian register here has been just moms about it well
[3:03:01.900 --> 3:03:07.660]  it's not a surprise because jp well that's newsworthy what base um and i'll look it up that they were
[3:03:07.660 --> 3:03:13.580]  on air saying they're going all drone at what base uh that would be the demoin uh international guard
[3:03:13.580 --> 3:03:21.020]  base here in Des Moines on the south side and uh they they also had uh uh you know no no coverage
[3:03:21.020 --> 3:03:26.140]  of it in the morning register at all which is not surprising since it's largest shareholder
[3:03:26.140 --> 3:03:29.980]  shareholder is gannett which is well they're gonna make you're gonna they're gonna make everybody
[3:03:29.980 --> 3:03:34.220]  go to robot cars everything they're already announcing it uh thank you so much great points
