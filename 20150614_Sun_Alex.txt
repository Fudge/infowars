[00:00.000 --> 00:12.700]  We are on the March the Empire is on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[00:17.700 --> 00:23.340]  Well King George III or the would-be King George III has announced his
[00:23.340 --> 00:28.500]  presidential run he's announced today that he'll announce tomorrow which is
[00:28.500 --> 00:33.240]  the same thing and Hillary of course is officially announced today as if we
[00:33.240 --> 00:40.080]  needed any dinosaur media to tell us that that dropping was about to hit the
[00:40.080 --> 00:47.120]  ground and it's all how she's a grandma and someone who loves women it's Hillary
[00:47.120 --> 00:54.440]  it's Jeb just dumbing it down to the most mindless logo you could imagine and
[00:54.440 --> 01:02.380]  one of the producers of the show pointed out an article from Zoom creative
[01:02.380 --> 01:07.640]  showing the dumbing down of logos from the 70s until now great example of
[01:07.640 --> 01:14.620]  Starbucks being complex image of a goddess in the middle of two circles
[01:14.620 --> 01:21.620]  coffee tea spices Starbucks and then being dumbed down now to simply a green
[01:21.620 --> 01:28.920]  dot Hillary Jeb red state blue state what is the point of that to dumb the
[01:28.920 --> 01:34.400]  language down which is the Fabian Socialist admitted plan for this
[01:34.400 --> 01:38.800]  country according to George Orwell Eric Blair who was a member of the
[01:38.800 --> 01:41.680]  organization
[01:44.200 --> 01:50.920]  truly disgusting but I'm not going to digress off into that too much today
[01:50.920 --> 02:01.800]  I shot a video yesterday in the early afternoon saying that look this may not
[02:01.800 --> 02:06.920]  have been a false flag up in Dallas this homemade armored vehicle we were told
[02:06.920 --> 02:10.720]  attacking the police department they just be
[02:10.720 --> 02:16.600]  suicide by cop but more complex but I said if they come out and say he was a
[02:16.600 --> 02:23.880]  conspiracy theorist and a listener of this show you know it's a false flag
[02:23.880 --> 02:32.560]  99% and why is that because the whole narrative is patriots are gonna attack
[02:32.560 --> 02:36.280]  police departments with pipe bombs for about six years it's not a question of
[02:36.280 --> 02:44.280]  it but when it's going to happen and then when it starts to happen out of a
[02:44.280 --> 02:49.800]  clear blue sky in basic criminology research when it's never happened before
[02:49.800 --> 02:55.000]  you would go then and ask who's claimed this was going to happen they're one of
[02:55.000 --> 02:59.520]  the main suspects Southern Poverty Law Center federal government ADL and
[02:59.520 --> 03:04.600]  others are the ones putting out this propaganda sure enough they said it was a
[03:04.600 --> 03:17.320]  homemade armored truck no it wasn't no it wasn't and on top of it it's in raw
[03:17.320 --> 03:23.520]  story the usual suspects and others Dallas shooter was a conspiracy theorist
[03:23.520 --> 03:26.800]  who threatened to shoot up schools and churches reports really well that's
[03:26.800 --> 03:32.320]  illegal I wasn't he arrested you've got this two-time felon who couldn't even
[03:32.320 --> 03:36.040]  pay us bills and then this all happens and I'm not saying the police
[03:36.040 --> 03:40.920]  themselves were involved in false flag what you do is this guy's dead
[03:40.920 --> 03:45.440]  hypothetically then they have a special team foreign mercs you name it do it
[03:45.440 --> 03:50.480]  they then get out of the vehicle his body's in the van they call the people
[03:50.480 --> 03:55.840]  in him the orders to sniping blow the van up basically and the rest is history
[03:55.840 --> 04:00.000]  because they've done this before in other countries in Operation Gladio and
[04:00.000 --> 04:04.360]  others similar false flags but the fact that the narrative fits so perfectly
[04:04.360 --> 04:09.480]  now you've got Jade Helm coming this summer I've said many times it could be
[04:09.480 --> 04:14.040]  the cover for terror attacks that are staged and the people staging them get
[04:14.040 --> 04:18.360]  caught or busted they'll use the cover of Jade Helm claiming it was part of a
[04:18.360 --> 04:23.440]  drill and we've seen this on so many other terror attacks in this country and
[04:23.440 --> 04:28.880]  others seven seven nine eleven the list is long they'll claim a drill was going
[04:28.880 --> 04:32.520]  on the local police showed up in Oklahoma City two minutes after Terrence
[04:32.520 --> 04:37.000]  Gaking and others and said why are you in bomb gear ATF why are you all
[04:37.000 --> 04:43.600]  waiting did you know this was gonna happen why were you in the building and
[04:43.600 --> 04:48.320]  they went we knew something was happening it was a drill a drill and of
[04:48.320 --> 04:55.880]  course big they was told it was a drill and was shut up so the thing stinks it
[04:55.880 --> 05:04.840]  stinks bad now infowarslife.com check it out today I have set out to bring you

[05:22.200 --> 05:26.120]  because they don't ask all of the strictest toxicology tests there are

[06:22.560 --> 06:34.680]  resistance it's Alex Jones thank you so much for joining us on this Sunday hard
[06:34.680 --> 06:43.760]  to believe it's already the 14th day of June 2015 we're going to be live here
[06:43.760 --> 06:52.440]  for the next two hours as we are every Sunday four to six p.m. central standard
[06:52.440 --> 07:06.320]  time well where to start really is a big question where where to begin and I
[07:06.320 --> 07:12.720]  seem to say that at the beginning of every broadcast because it is so true
[07:12.720 --> 07:20.200]  first off the really good news the Trans Pacific partnership that's been
[07:20.200 --> 07:27.480]  developed for 10 years in secret by mega corporations worldwide will merge the
[07:27.480 --> 07:31.280]  North American Union that's been integrated by stealth ram through by
[07:31.280 --> 07:36.920]  stealth and the European Union also put in by fraud and secretly then to be
[07:36.920 --> 07:44.600]  unveiled later these these totalitarian systems are basically being finished up
[07:44.600 --> 07:50.240]  right now the good news is after 10 years of them trying to finagle this
[07:50.240 --> 07:57.200]  behind-the-scenes this corporate takeover you know they say God destroyed
[07:57.200 --> 08:03.360]  the world with water next time it's fire well in the past countries got taken
[08:03.360 --> 08:08.120]  over by military force now you get taken over by corporate fraud and long-term
[08:08.120 --> 08:14.280]  strategic systems well the really good news is getting to it is the TPP got
[08:14.280 --> 08:20.600]  shot down by a healthy margin in the house on Friday Nancy Pelosi had voted
[08:20.600 --> 08:24.200]  for it she ran back up and changed her vote when she saw that it was already
[08:24.200 --> 08:28.800]  defeated talk about the consummate coward so she can lie to her constituents
[08:28.800 --> 08:34.600]  and say that she didn't support it truly amazing the Republican leadership did
[08:34.600 --> 08:39.120]  not change their votes they are pressuring Obama to pressure the
[08:39.120 --> 08:47.240]  Democrats and it's truly nauseating it's illegal on its face it hands over our
[08:47.240 --> 08:52.280]  sovereignty three sections have been leaked by WikiLeaks it gives Obama total
[08:52.280 --> 08:57.360]  open borders total amnesty allows corporations to shut down any businesses
[08:57.360 --> 09:03.080]  they want or sue them it is dictatorship by a bunch of megacorporations
[09:03.080 --> 09:08.200]  they've already gone to the UN and tried to get and partially got diplomatic
[09:08.200 --> 09:12.200]  immunity for international brokerage firms I mean it's just new titles of
[09:12.200 --> 09:21.160]  nobility that's all it is above the law garbage and the articles by Curt
[09:21.160 --> 09:24.520]  Nemo upon info wars.com it's very important please get it out to everybody
[09:24.520 --> 09:28.840]  because we just had a big victory but they're coming back which is outrageous
[09:28.840 --> 09:35.040]  in and of itself we just voted it down they're gonna tag it on to a new piece
[09:35.040 --> 09:43.480]  of legislation globalist plan to ram through TAA next week which basically
[09:43.480 --> 09:48.840]  ties into the TPP that's that trade authority to allow him the fast track
[09:48.840 --> 09:55.920]  to allow the president to act as dictator. Senator Sessions warns TAA and TPA which
[09:55.920 --> 10:00.520]  are again part of the trans-specific partnership will undermine American
[10:00.520 --> 10:06.400]  workers no kidding oh but Al Gore told us on Larry King live that it was a good
[10:06.400 --> 10:13.680]  deal. Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions warns there will be another attempt in
[10:13.680 --> 10:23.200]  Congress on Tuesday to push through the TAA and fast track authority and it just
[10:23.200 --> 10:28.760]  goes on from there. If it happens it will empower the president to form a
[10:28.760 --> 10:33.800]  Pacific Union encompassing 40% of the world's economy and 12 nations each will
[10:33.800 --> 10:37.560]  be equal one vote once the union is formed foreign bureaucrats will be
[10:37.560 --> 10:41.840]  required to meet regularly to write the Commission's rules regulations and
[10:41.840 --> 10:46.120]  directives impacting American jobs wages and sovereignty session says in a
[10:46.120 --> 10:50.040]  statement posted on a Senate webpage yeah that's what we know from the three
[10:50.040 --> 10:54.080]  sections we've got is that it's like Obamacare it's pretty much open-ended
[10:54.080 --> 10:58.000]  it just says the Commission can do whatever it wants and your countries
[10:58.000 --> 11:04.920]  voted irrevocably to opt into this well that's a fraud too. Now who's supporting
[11:04.920 --> 11:12.720]  it the Republican and Democratic leadership Paul Ryan the trader there's
[11:12.720 --> 11:18.440]  no other word of describing on trade vote Obama must sway Democrats to salvage
[11:18.440 --> 11:22.320]  deal and again the Democrats are wrong about taking our guns they're wrong
[11:22.320 --> 11:25.600]  about opening our borders they're wrong about so many things but they're right
[11:25.600 --> 11:30.640]  the grassroots are about labeling GMO and they're right about not handing our
[11:30.640 --> 11:34.720]  power over to foreign corporations and having secret votes on it and not
[11:34.720 --> 11:41.000]  releasing the text of what's in it but that's the Democrat grassroots who else
[11:41.000 --> 11:46.880]  fought it the Republican grassroots the libertarian Tea Party but
[11:46.880 --> 11:50.000]  Democrats need to understand if you don't like the TPP you shouldn't like
[11:50.000 --> 11:54.840]  open borders because this is globalism don't you understand you think it's
[11:54.840 --> 11:59.280]  going to be votes for the Democratic Party so you get more free stuff because
[11:59.280 --> 12:03.120]  I get the class warfare it's the mega rich funding the class warfare to get
[12:03.120 --> 12:07.760]  rid of the middle class bring in a voting block game over and it won't matter
[12:07.760 --> 12:14.040]  because the power is already being transferred to international bodies the
[12:14.040 --> 12:17.640]  leading house supporter of trade legislation the Democrats drove to
[12:17.640 --> 12:23.480]  defeat this week said Sunday President Obama must sway his own party to save
[12:23.480 --> 12:27.440]  the measure well I've got clips we'll play it if we've got time later of
[12:27.440 --> 12:35.160]  Obama's radio address slash TV address and he's up there saying we got to
[12:35.160 --> 12:39.080]  ram it through it's so good for American workers
[12:40.720 --> 12:46.960]  truly sickening but the good news is they said it was inevitable they said
[12:46.960 --> 12:51.400]  they had a whole bunch extra votes it got shot down we've just got to maintain
[12:51.400 --> 12:56.720]  our vigilance and listen even if they try to pass the secret agreement that is
[12:56.720 --> 13:00.080]  they give the president the right to sign on to this blank check to a foreign
[13:00.080 --> 13:06.920]  shadowy corporate governmental dictatorship England the UK never got a
[13:06.920 --> 13:10.720]  vote in the late 80s early 90s with three different votes but the mass trick
[13:10.720 --> 13:15.200]  treaty and others they never got a vote to be brought into it they were told
[13:15.200 --> 13:21.320]  conspiracy theory there's no EU it doesn't exist and you're not going under
[13:21.320 --> 13:26.320]  it and don't worry about these meetings and you can't see the treaties and now
[13:26.320 --> 13:31.480]  over 80% of their laws on record get made by unelected bureaucrats in
[13:31.480 --> 13:37.400]  Brussels they're done they're pushing and they've got record members of
[13:37.400 --> 13:43.880]  parliament shedding it to have a vote to withdraw from the European Union because
[13:43.880 --> 13:49.200]  he wants you identify the stuff's going on anybody living who has half a brain
[13:49.200 --> 13:53.640]  in Europe remembers the EU started as a quote trade deal like NAFTA or GATT or
[13:53.640 --> 13:59.680]  TPP they're not trade deals they're takeovers and we now know they're
[13:59.680 --> 14:05.120]  takeovers so the public may be dumbed down to a certain extent but not this
[14:05.120 --> 14:14.240]  dumb so I salute the good Democrats who aren't insane I mean even even even the
[14:14.240 --> 14:19.440]  corrupt elites of this country I would imagine wouldn't want to sell out
[14:19.440 --> 14:24.240]  sovereignty and the source of their long-term power to international
[14:24.240 --> 14:29.880]  bureaucracies and mega corporations but they want that big giant payday now and
[14:29.880 --> 14:37.720]  they're given positions in the new global government but it is the most
[14:37.720 --> 14:43.480]  treacherous insanity I've ever heard of in history but it's done through
[14:43.480 --> 14:51.920]  corporate systems not military now later it's backed up militarily the feds
[14:51.920 --> 14:56.240]  enforce these international IMF rulings IMF rules against you through
[14:56.240 --> 15:01.280]  these treaties your business you don't comply here comes the SWAT team and by
[15:01.280 --> 15:04.680]  the way we know from the NRA that's talked to Republicans they've been able
[15:04.680 --> 15:10.200]  to see the secret sections there is gun restriction in the treaty as well 28
[15:10.200 --> 15:15.680]  sections cut down from 33 three have been leaked they're so draconian I can't
[15:15.680 --> 15:21.960]  believe it and that's why he got shot down last week is it got leaked Joe on
[15:21.960 --> 15:25.440]  Wednesday by WikiLeaks another section and it said yeah no the president is
[15:25.440 --> 15:30.040]  given any authority on borders immigrants corporations any hospitals
[15:30.040 --> 15:37.040]  it's got Obamacare in it worldwide I mean it is just crazy it allows foreign
[15:37.040 --> 15:41.080]  companies to come in and control our health care and to sue a city-owned
[15:41.080 --> 15:46.680]  hospital that's already there because it competes with a globalist corporate
[15:46.680 --> 15:53.120]  hospital they want to build I mean it's the it's not free market they show this
[15:53.120 --> 15:57.600]  free market what it is piracy and looting we're gonna be back stay with us on

[20:39.040 --> 20:46.280]  apocalypse assault vehicle of course I'm talking about the attack in the early
[20:46.280 --> 20:51.440]  morning hours Friday night in a Saturday morning in Dallas Texas against the
[20:51.440 --> 20:56.760]  police department and don't worry the Democrat run White House run media is
[20:56.760 --> 21:01.080]  already blaming quote conspiracy theorist that means anyone who questions
[21:01.080 --> 21:05.640]  known government liars anyone that understands this country's been taken
[21:05.640 --> 21:11.320]  over it looks bad with Jade Helm coming up you know I talked about I'm stirring
[21:11.320 --> 21:17.400]  up things staging events smoke screening it I'm not even saying the police are
[21:17.400 --> 21:20.920]  involved because it's it's I'm gonna explain how you can stage these things I
[21:20.920 --> 21:28.280]  wasn't sure it was staged a shot of video Saturday asking the question shot at
[21:28.280 --> 21:31.240]  the nursing home while visiting my grandmother some outsize the nursing
[21:31.240 --> 21:38.880]  home went out and shot it is the Dallas police attack a false flag I said
[21:38.880 --> 21:43.920]  probably not unless they complete the final piece of the narrative and blame
[21:43.920 --> 21:50.440]  conspiracy theorist quote info wars now happened you're like oh so anytime you're
[21:50.440 --> 21:57.520]  blamed it's staged no we've seen them staged up before and blame us over and
[21:57.520 --> 22:02.520]  over again I mean we can't be behind everything bad right it's a narrative
[22:02.520 --> 22:07.800]  there's never been people attacking police departments with pipe bombs and
[22:07.800 --> 22:11.200]  armored vehicles except for the weathermen and they're the folks that
[22:11.200 --> 22:18.680]  advise the White House on record it's not really ever happened and they keep
[22:18.680 --> 22:21.680]  saying it's imminent it's giant it's gonna happen get ready get ready and
[22:21.680 --> 22:25.600]  during Jade Helm they're doing drills just like this quote simulating illegal
[22:25.600 --> 22:29.920]  activities against police and others they've had multiple special forces
[22:29.920 --> 22:36.480]  people killed outside Fort Bragg doing stuff like this before look it up or they
[22:36.480 --> 22:40.080]  tell them it's a drill it turns out to not be a drill I don't know if this was
[22:40.080 --> 22:49.080]  staged but man it's looking bad so Joe Biggs and Jacarie Jackson didn't even
[22:49.080 --> 22:55.520]  have to be called Saturday morning at 7 a.m. I called Joe first the answer the
[22:55.520 --> 23:00.520]  phone and he said I'm already driving north Jacarie's already there we're
[23:00.520 --> 23:04.360]  going to different locations where the armored car got shot up the armored van
[23:04.360 --> 23:09.480]  and the police department Jacarie which is an armored van bigs the police
[23:09.480 --> 23:14.160]  department those reports are on info wars.com and prisonplanet.com so Joe
[23:14.160 --> 23:18.680]  Biggs will join us at the bottom of the next hour to give us his take but it's
[23:18.680 --> 23:23.440]  starting to really smell and there are real events like the guy with the bull
[23:23.440 --> 23:27.800]  does it running around running into things and you know the whole black
[23:27.800 --> 23:31.800]  lives matter thing being funded by Soros that then you know promotes with time
[23:31.800 --> 23:35.840]  magazine and Newsweek saying it's heroic to you know to attack police and fire
[23:35.840 --> 23:40.320]  bomb things I mean if I said that'd be arrested folks it's a call to action plus
[23:40.320 --> 23:44.720]  firebombing police is going to bring in a civil war the last thing we want only
[23:44.720 --> 23:49.080]  scum are promoting that and some people go Alex what are you doing not want to
[23:49.080 --> 23:54.200]  go to the police hey idiots the globalist want that number one that
[23:54.200 --> 23:58.000]  tells you it's bad number two intellectually think that over we don't
[23:58.000 --> 24:01.920]  want to attack our local governments it's the globalist that sees the federal
[24:01.920 --> 24:05.880]  government they're taking over we want the cities and counties and states
[24:05.880 --> 24:12.600]  controlled by people that support basic bill of rights and by being tricked in a
[24:12.600 --> 24:17.080]  fake civil war you know the way to protest and attack police they push to
[24:17.080 --> 24:21.800]  destabilize things creates a vacuum for the feds to come in themselves controlled
[24:21.800 --> 24:25.560]  by the globalist they've been taken over
[24:26.400 --> 24:29.880]  I said I'd cover that later I'm already ranting about it it's just so
[24:29.880 --> 24:37.160]  elementary it's so simple if George Soros is spending hundreds of millions
[24:37.160 --> 24:43.000]  33 million just in Ferguson alone groups connected to him running around with
[24:43.000 --> 24:47.920]  mall off cocktails and saying kill police do you think killing police is a
[24:47.920 --> 24:52.160]  good idea if George Soros is out there promoting and his destabilization this
[24:52.160 --> 24:57.280]  guy just overthrew Ukraine a year and a half ago he didn't play in games okay
[24:57.280 --> 25:02.400]  did the same thing there legitimate problems with the government funded
[25:02.400 --> 25:06.040]  street mobs to a firebomb attack the police over the government put
[25:06.040 --> 25:10.280]  dictators in now they're on the verge of war with Russia I've got that stack of
[25:10.280 --> 25:14.040]  news fact you know before I build a bird I'll hit build a bird next segment let
[25:14.040 --> 25:17.560]  me go ahead and cover the Russia situation right now okay go ahead get
[25:17.560 --> 25:25.480]  in that mi-6 recall secret agents from abroad for fear of uncover by Russia and
[25:25.480 --> 25:30.400]  China Russia's now gone offensive folks they're breaking into everything because
[25:30.400 --> 25:34.840]  they're surrounded Moscow has gained access to over one million classified
[25:34.840 --> 25:38.880]  files that contain details of secret intelligence techniques and information
[25:38.880 --> 25:45.200]  basically a list of spies so the the the Russians are penetrating mi-6 right
[25:45.200 --> 25:52.320]  now and undoubtedly done it before now if you know how British intelligence
[25:52.320 --> 25:55.640]  works that's probably on purpose and pure disinformation and the Russians know
[25:55.640 --> 25:59.920]  that and I'm not lionizing them either one is they're not over here trying to
[25:59.920 --> 26:04.480]  take my guns and and and trying to teach kids you know how to work little
[26:04.480 --> 26:09.200]  boys that were dresses the globalists have surrounded them they're trying to
[26:09.200 --> 26:13.760]  poke them into a confrontation so see I don't go to a bar and find some big
[26:13.760 --> 26:18.160]  really mean guy and go over to start poking him for no reason now if he comes
[26:18.160 --> 26:20.640]  over and tries to do something to me number one I'm not gonna be in a bar
[26:20.640 --> 26:23.920]  like that number two then I'll have to fight but I don't just go around
[26:23.920 --> 26:30.840]  looking for fights and that's not what America does that's what tyrants do and
[26:30.840 --> 26:34.800]  the ash heap of histories full of countries that go this direction and I
[26:34.800 --> 26:38.800]  meant to cover it on Friday and Thursday but Samantha Powers the US ambassador of
[26:38.800 --> 26:43.560]  the UN I saw the video of it in the morning on Thursday and I saw the
[26:43.560 --> 26:47.520]  transcript as she threatened Russians and we have the military to defeat you I
[26:47.520 --> 26:53.280]  mean if you had the military to defeat Russia you don't go taunt them and you
[26:53.280 --> 26:57.400]  don't send a woman who's never even the military I mean it was some female
[26:57.400 --> 27:01.040]  general who was a war hero and some great mathematician or something when
[27:01.040 --> 27:05.840]  you do it but the image of a civilian and a woman in a business suit
[27:05.840 --> 27:09.920]  threatening the Russians in organizing troops against them I mean this is the
[27:09.920 --> 27:19.960]  stuff that World War three's made out of it is an obscene image to the world and
[27:19.960 --> 27:23.480]  hey of the weirdo psychiatrist and psychologist at psych warfare think you

[35:46.040 --> 35:51.280]  know them as ISIS but we attacked Iraq for 9-11 you see how that worked Saudi
[35:51.280 --> 35:56.760]  Arabia had friends inside our government that they knew were ready to blame their
[35:56.760 --> 36:04.280]  enemy Iraq to take them out criminals in our government knew and bare minimum
[36:04.280 --> 36:10.760]  stood down that's former senator Graham that's current congressman Walter Jones
[36:10.760 --> 36:18.080]  and that's others in Congress that have read the 28 pages it came out in secret
[36:18.080 --> 36:25.240]  congressional testimony from the Pentagon because people in the Pentagon knew
[36:25.240 --> 36:31.120]  the truth and they don't like what happened and they tried to expose it
[36:31.120 --> 36:37.960]  see Bell Edmonds was a NSA translator for the FBI she got in this a intercepts
[36:37.960 --> 36:42.960]  and in the months before 9-11 she heard the whole thing the FBI do the whole
[36:42.960 --> 36:49.080]  thing that leaked back to the FBI field offices in Dallas Phoenix Minneapolis
[36:49.080 --> 36:53.440]  St. Paul other cities they try to stop the attacks you know it all came out that
[36:53.440 --> 36:58.320]  they were ordered to stand down so see we knew all this 14 years ago it came out
[36:58.320 --> 37:04.040]  that the FBI had their hands tied so I said hey which a cover-up and the media
[37:04.040 --> 37:10.280]  called me a traitor no I'm not a traitor I'm an American as American as it gets I
[37:10.280 --> 37:13.640]  don't want to sit here and look if you come here and you love Liberty you love
[37:13.640 --> 37:16.720]  free market you love guns in the Second Amendment and you got here when you were
[37:16.720 --> 37:20.040]  10 years old and you're a citizen now you're as American as I am whether you're
[37:20.040 --> 37:26.680]  from a Czech Republic or from from from China or Mexico but don't be a little
[37:26.680 --> 37:30.520]  globalist minion and tell me I'm not American because I say my government's
[37:30.520 --> 37:37.480]  done evil things and my government's been taken over because that's a fact but I
[37:37.480 --> 37:41.200]  don't want America to fail I don't want these criminals to take it over it is
[37:41.200 --> 37:46.200]  territorial for me because my family on both sides was on the Mayflower and my
[37:46.200 --> 37:50.600]  family on both sides was involved in 1776 big time and my family was involved
[37:50.600 --> 37:54.560]  more than anybody else basically you're gonna find in Texas and start in this
[37:54.560 --> 38:00.320]  state I mean it's sickening how much my family was involved I mean we're talking
[38:00.320 --> 38:05.840]  about detonators in that revolution and I'm a detonator in this one but not a
[38:05.840 --> 38:11.040]  revolution I want to restore our Republic I want a revolution I want to be
[38:11.040 --> 38:18.720]  the detonator for the restoration of the American Republic you want to have some
[38:18.720 --> 38:24.720]  UN style Truth and Reconciliation Commission so we'll have them Nuremberg style
[38:24.720 --> 38:31.720]  we'll restore this country's good name and we will actually promote and realize
[38:31.720 --> 38:37.640]  the true renaissance ideas that this country was the greatest expression of
[38:37.640 --> 38:41.920]  we're gonna come back play incredible confrontations with the head of NM Roth
[38:41.920 --> 38:48.320]  child reporters confronting them Bilderberg group minions had to get to

[39:05.280 --> 39:09.160]  the cops leave and got into Bilderberg hotel obviously a lot of intel could be
[39:09.160 --> 39:16.120]  there a lot of intel leaving at that about what goes on these criminal meetings
[39:16.120 --> 39:20.080]  and they freaked out and threw them out that's all coming up we're gonna break it
[39:20.080 --> 39:26.680]  down but before we do that let's go ahead and go to some video for TV viewers
[39:26.680 --> 39:31.520]  the radio audience audio from 2006 when I bullhorn the Bilderberg group in
[39:31.520 --> 39:39.680]  Canada and they basically got really upset about this this is audio my
[39:39.680 --> 39:44.440]  bullhorning put to the the Bilderberg members scurrying at the airport in

[48:43.160 --> 48:49.600]  again that's the end of my little speech I gave Bill Berber back in 2006 and then
[48:49.600 --> 48:56.840]  the late Richard C. Holbrook of the State Department came out to speak to us
[48:56.840 --> 49:01.520]  and I wish I wouldn't have yelled at him more because then he went that like ten
[49:01.520 --> 49:06.120]  feet away and turned away and walked away I was like good Holbrook get over and
[49:06.120 --> 49:12.720]  talk to me but get to understand these really are the folks trying to get rid
[49:12.720 --> 49:16.040]  of cash trying to get rid of local businesses
[49:16.040 --> 49:22.880]  Bilderberg set up the euro they set up NAFTA and GATT they set up the TPP are
[49:22.880 --> 49:26.800]  there other globalist meetings yes but David Rockefeller's the Big Ben
[49:26.800 --> 49:31.720]  Brzezinski Henry Kissinger it's come out in former German Chancellor's books
[49:31.720 --> 49:36.240]  like Men in Powers the political retrospective by Helmut Schmidt German
[49:36.240 --> 49:41.820]  Chancellor that though they make decisions at these these are the secret
[49:41.820 --> 49:48.840]  G7s these are the secret summits with corporate leaders deciding the future
[49:48.840 --> 49:58.160]  of our world deciding to give banks taxpayer money deciding to let them be
[49:58.160 --> 50:04.440]  too big to fail and to be one thing if we propped up big banks that were helping
[50:04.440 --> 50:09.400]  the economy they're not helping they're absolutely doing everything they can to
[50:09.400 --> 50:18.560]  consolidate control now Franco Barnaby the head of Rothschild worldwide one of
[50:18.560 --> 50:25.120]  the most powerful organizations in the world Franco Barnaby head of Rothschild
[50:25.120 --> 50:29.640]  Europe but that's really the head of the whole five systems and Bilderberg
[50:29.640 --> 50:34.080]  steering committee member one of the heads of Bilderberg was confronted at the
[50:34.080 --> 50:43.120]  train station in Innsbruck by info wars European reporters and here's part of
[50:43.120 --> 50:48.920]  this lengthy confrontation part of it's in German we're playing part of that's
[50:48.920 --> 50:53.240]  in English but the whole thing's up on info wars.com right now let's play a
[50:53.240 --> 51:00.000]  clip of that good we had just one statement for the press and I leave
[51:00.000 --> 51:08.120]  you alone is it's really that dangerous to talk about it there's no
[51:08.120 --> 51:15.880]  danger so why is it so strict there's no stick but then you can say just one
[51:15.880 --> 51:24.680]  sentence it was back it up five seconds it's no strict this is the head the
[51:24.680 --> 51:27.480]  private corporate head because the Rothschilds are too lazy to run their
[51:27.480 --> 51:31.960]  own empires now this is the guy that heads up basically the Rothschild Empire
[51:31.960 --> 51:36.800]  he goes there every year he basically runs Bilderberg under Etanian Davenillon
[51:36.800 --> 51:43.320]  the the the count I mean you can't make this up it's like the number two guy in
[51:43.320 --> 51:48.240]  Bilderberg Queen Beatrice used to be number two but now she still goes the
[51:48.240 --> 51:52.640]  head of the Netherlands she owns Dutch roll shell her wealth is a state secret
[51:52.640 --> 51:56.280]  probably worth a trillion dollars conservatively what she actually has
[51:56.280 --> 52:01.840]  is estimated a trillion tens of trillions leverage this guy is in there
[52:01.840 --> 52:08.080]  and he's not strict they did no danger they had helicopter gunships six miles
[52:08.080 --> 52:16.560]  away checkpoints everywhere 11 year old Austrian kids we playing in parks police
[52:16.560 --> 52:22.320]  would come talk to him six miles away but nothing important is happening let's
[52:22.320 --> 52:28.480]  go back to the club and then you can't say just one sentence to me well what
[52:28.480 --> 52:32.480]  should I say what should I say what the issues you talked about who you are I
[52:32.480 --> 52:38.760]  mean we find this out anyway so we got the list already so the list is is
[52:38.760 --> 52:47.560]  published yes there's no secret about this there's no secret about the
[52:47.560 --> 52:53.040]  why are you so silent about it then this doesn't back it up again back it up again
[52:53.040 --> 53:00.280]  for 40 years they said this doesn't exist it's big jokes conservative talk show
[53:00.280 --> 53:07.840]  hosts it's a made-up word no Bilderberg what is that a hamburger but then we've
[53:07.840 --> 53:13.040]  actually gotten documents out of it and others have and so now they're forced
[53:13.040 --> 53:18.360]  to admit it exists but now oh it's no big deal you're still the theorist there's
[53:18.360 --> 53:23.040]  no smoky room you're right this is not our grandpa's smoky room back to the
[53:23.040 --> 53:30.000]  head of the Rothschild Empire is published yes so there is no secret
[53:30.000 --> 53:36.680]  about this there's no secret about the why are you so silent about it then if
[53:36.680 --> 53:44.480]  there's no secret about it there's no secrecy about this then just one statement
[53:47.400 --> 53:53.160]  it pause again we forced them to admit it's real so the last few years they

[01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:30.600]  police detective I wonder if we're ever invited there that looks really beautiful

[01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:41.560]  gonna talk to our reporters from Austria I'm sure that at the end of this five
[01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:47.880]  harrowing days they're soused we'll see what they're up to there from the Alpine
[01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:56.080]  Kingdom the former Germanic stronghold of Austria straight ahead I'm Alex John
[01:04:56.080 --> 01:05:01.360]  stay with us the secret Bilderberg meeting might not be worthy of news
[01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:04.680]  coverage from the corporate media but it's certainly getting attention from
[01:05:04.680 --> 01:05:08.760]  the police military and intelligence services you've seen our reporters being
[01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:12.960]  harassed at checkpoints all week well now an exclusion zone has been secured
[01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:17.200]  around the entire interalpine hotel grounds trespassers face two weeks
[01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:22.040]  imprisonment and a hefty fine a 30-mile no-fly zone extends to drones planes
[01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:27.080]  paragliders even hang gliders the ban also extends to video and audio
[01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:31.680]  recordings made within and around the area apparently Bilderberg is so afraid
[01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:35.440]  of media coverage that police checkpoints miles away from the hotel
[01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:39.920]  aren't enough now info wars reporters on the ground say that Bilderberg has
[01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:44.280]  deployed a high-tech jamming system to shut down communications around the
[01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:48.800]  site this will effectively strangle media coverage of the event ensuring that
[01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:53.840]  over 130 heads of finance government and the corporate world are able to meet in
[01:05:53.840 --> 01:06:00.080]  total secrecy visit info wars.com for breaking Bilderberg coverage
[01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:13.440]  we now take you live to the central Texas commenced at her and the heart of
[01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:19.680]  the resistance rallying Patriots Worldwide
[01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:45.680]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:54.320]  we are back live coming a little bit late here in the second hour because I've
[01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:57.880]  been on the phone to Austria the last few minutes we can't get a Skype
[01:06:57.880 --> 01:07:01.720]  connection or to phone connection on our regular equipment I could be on my
[01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:08.920]  cell phone to get a final report Bilderberg a big globalist secret enclave
[01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:14.360]  meeting that set up the euro they've released those documents the BBC that
[01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:21.520]  has set up pretty much the modern state of the Western world just completed its
[01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:28.000]  meeting and we caught the globalist flying on their private jets you name it
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:35.120]  those videos are up on info wars.com and prison planet.com and it's by
[01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:40.880]  identifying the shadowy groups that control things like the TPP the
[01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:46.240]  Trans-Pacific Partnership that we can ignite the public's interest to start
[01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:53.640]  being concerned and caring about the real world here's an example we hear
[01:07:53.640 --> 01:07:58.960]  things like this football player or this basketball player could cement their
[01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:07.320]  place in history by winning this championship and it's oh my gosh it's
[01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:13.040]  history it's so important or the lead singer of the Foo Fighters this weekend
[01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:18.600]  as he did broke his leg falling off the stage but he came back out and finished
[01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:27.320]  it with another song he's now a legend in rock everybody's like whoa unbelievable
[01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:33.520]  okay great but see used to before the modern era and it's all been declassified
[01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:40.240]  it's all come out that the the nephew of Sigmund Freud Edward Bernays and others
[01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:45.680]  were hired by the department by the Department of War to change their names
[01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:53.880]  the Department of Defense and to sell us the current world we basically live
[01:08:53.880 --> 01:09:01.160]  under today and so we think of somebody winning a basketball game or winning a
[01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:09.200]  world series as epic as man we tribally had a victory this is important yeah
[01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:14.280]  maybe this point thousands of times I'll make it again but when we shoot down on
[01:09:14.280 --> 01:09:18.560]  the TPP that signs our sovereignty over to a bunch of globalists that are known
[01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:24.440]  for screwing every country they get a hold of seven ways to Sunday and then
[01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:31.080]  again and again so bad it's beyond comic book villain stuff comic book villains
[01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:35.280]  are just based on these people bond villains are based on these people Ian
[01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:39.560]  Fleming was MI6 he admitted that he said before he died specters basically real
[01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:42.640]  that's what runs the world these corporate boards he was talking about

[01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:29.520]  we're not children at a magic show we know you got a table with an invisible
[01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:34.000]  door in the top and you reach down the hat and the rabbit is inside a box do

[01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:58.720]  nightmare in this is epic legendary stuff going on a trillion times more
[01:11:58.720 --> 01:12:03.960]  important than the arrogant narcissist LeBron James running around on ego
[01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:11.880]  trips I'm all into celebrating humans and sports everything else but they
[01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:17.000]  misappropriate our energies the energies you have for cheering is for when your
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:25.080]  tribe wins not for when someone does a simulated combat maneuver the real
[01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:29.840]  world economy the human future is not about guys on a court throwing a ball
[01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:36.200]  in a hoop or guys on a vista hitting balls and I get basketball I get golf I
[01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:41.400]  like golf I like watching basketball the point is it isn't God it isn't our
[01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:47.800]  future it isn't what's important bad groups have seized control of our banks
[01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:51.560]  our government they are screwing us over they're getting ready to do it even
[01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:55.920]  more they think we're so pathetic and we're fighting back Bilderberg's in
[01:12:55.920 --> 01:12:59.520]  trouble all these other globalist groups under them are in trouble they're
[01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:05.080]  right at the top of the capstone are they the most elite group they're co-equal
[01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:10.640]  to a bunch of other organizations but it's all run by the same people most
[01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:16.880]  people in power are scared to even say their name we're willing to charge in
[01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:21.600]  and take them on head to head that's epic so I wanted on record whatever happens
[01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:25.040]  to me I took the field against these people I personally been to five of
[01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:29.120]  their events I personally send my reporters out to confront them and my
[01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:33.640]  name is signed like John Hancock John Hancock wasn't a narcissist when he
[01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:37.760]  signed his name five times bigger than George Washington's on the Declaration
[01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:41.120]  of Independence he knew they were coming after his family he knew they were
[01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:45.880]  coming after his treasure and his life and so he said you know what I'm gonna
[01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:50.880]  sign it big when I signed my own death warrant because it's either the life of
[01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:55.600]  my country or the death of my body and he signed it liberty or death that's
[01:13:55.600 --> 01:14:00.680]  what it's about so let me sign my name real big on 2015 Declaration of
[01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:08.720]  Independence Alex Jones baby that's my name and you know it I'll never be a
[01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:14.120]  parasite like you now we take you now live to us to Austria we're gonna come
[01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:17.520]  back in the next segment with more time but I got wound up here Paul Watson tell
[01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:21.000]  us what's coming up tell us what happened in this last day it seems more
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:24.760]  important than all the days before it at Bilderberg the five days you guys have
[01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:29.760]  been there well it was definitely the best day Alex in terms of the footage
[01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:33.440]  that we got in the confrontation so basically started off with us again
[01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:37.760]  driving up to the hotel past the checkpoint and it was the most lax day
[01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:41.160]  of all despite the fact that you know over a hundred Bilderberg members who
[01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:45.240]  were driving down the road we would literally drive past them didn't even
[01:14:45.240 --> 01:14:50.520]  check our IDs after days of harassment and ID checks and vehicle searches and
[01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:55.000]  bag searches they didn't even check us once which again illustrates the fact
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:59.000]  that they knew we weren't a physical threat to any of the Bilderberg as
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:03.800]  because we were right in their faces at the airport this was all a tactic designed
[01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:08.080]  to intimidate the media and prevent the media from going up there which is why
[01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:12.880]  apart from info wars RT was the only you know international media organization
[01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:17.960]  that was even there physically so it completely debunked the notion that this
[01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:23.400]  was to do with genuine security and they had police six miles away halfway up a
[01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:27.640]  mountain harassing us when today we could get right up to the Bilderberg
[01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:33.700]  members faces right at the entrance to the terminal building of the airport so
[01:15:33.700 --> 01:15:37.840]  that was the first thing of course then we went straight to the airport and it
[01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:42.360]  was a trickle at first but after a couple of hours it was literally a free-for-all
[01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:45.880]  and we can get into that after the break Paul your Skype is epic if you're a
[01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:50.800]  radio listener you got to go to info wars.com forward slash show info wars.com
[01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:55.840]  forward slash show to see the free video feeds from Austria and pass that link

[01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:07.920]  and it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop
[01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:12.460]  a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children
[01:16:12.460 --> 01:16:16.880]  focus all of our children are hit with modern mind control television music

[01:16:26.200 --> 01:16:29.800]  wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous

[01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:11.760]  info wars.com because the companies I've been approached by were not the
[01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:15.680]  highest quality and they weren't as affordable as they should be so I
[01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:20.320]  refused probably 30 40 firearms manufacturers over the years will then

[01:20:11.480 --> 01:20:14.480]  big brother
[01:20:14.480 --> 01:20:27.760]  mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he live
[01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:35.640]  from Austin, Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones
[01:20:38.480 --> 01:20:43.120]  I went in my whole round about sports figures and movie stars earlier now they're not important
[01:20:43.120 --> 01:20:48.280]  I'm not attacking them as individuals any celebration of you know human
[01:20:48.280 --> 01:20:53.440]  accomplishment I love is that we're told that's what's epic history no epic
[01:20:53.440 --> 01:20:58.200]  history is shooting down the TPP so far epic history is going and fronting the
[01:20:58.200 --> 01:21:02.840]  shadow government globalists that's what humans are supposed to do to not be
[01:21:02.840 --> 01:21:08.600]  slaves Paul Watson from Austria Bilderberg 2015 just ended I'd say we've
[01:21:08.600 --> 01:21:14.720]  got record Intel their TPP got shot down their entire agenda is in trouble
[01:21:14.720 --> 01:21:20.280]  please continue Paul Watson yeah so we got to the airport we were trying to
[01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:24.160]  find a good vantage zone and we decided the best place would just to be right
[01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:27.320]  there at the terminal entrance because many of them started to pull in as I
[01:21:27.320 --> 01:21:32.080]  said at first it was a trickle then it was a deluge and basically it was a
[01:21:32.080 --> 01:21:36.320]  free-for-all they didn't know where to pull in the police changed the location
[01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:40.320]  for where the cars were pulling in several times and so we were able to get
[01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:44.560]  right up on them ask them questions get right in their face as they were
[01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:48.760]  entering the hotel building but before that our friend Tillman who we're gonna
[01:21:48.760 --> 01:21:55.240]  speak to shortly hopefully he was able to go to the train station because some
[01:21:55.240 --> 01:21:59.240]  of them were traveling by train the ones that live in Italy in nearby countries
[01:21:59.240 --> 01:22:04.800]  as opposed to going to the airport so he had a confrontation with Franco
[01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:09.760]  Burnaby we played it we played it last hour yes it's the top story on info was
[01:22:09.760 --> 01:22:15.040]  who is the head of Rothschild in Europe former Italian telecommunications CEO
[01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:20.240]  and a steering committee member of the Bilderberg group so this is one of the
[01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:25.160]  top guys in Bilderberg didn't we see Robert Rubin soon yeah he was there too
[01:22:25.160 --> 01:22:30.080]  former Treasury Secretary yeah but this is one of the guys who decides what they
[01:22:30.080 --> 01:22:35.320]  discuss and who to invite so this is one of the key most influential people in
[01:22:35.320 --> 01:22:41.760]  Bilderberg Barnaby is a kingpin of kingpins yeah exactly so it was a 12
[01:22:41.760 --> 01:22:47.000]  minute conversation it wasn't a 10 22nd confrontation this was an actual
[01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:52.400]  conversation in which Burnaby basically said oh Bilderberg will put out a
[01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:55.720]  statement that will answer your question well no they won't put out a statement
[01:22:55.720 --> 01:23:00.800]  the only statement they put out was to say we welcome general interest in the
[01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:05.080]  conference which is completely ludicrous because they surrounded themselves
[01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:10.720]  with a ring of steel with 2,000 police with police on the mountain harassing as
[01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:16.920]  miles away so they helicopter gunships radar jamming I mean it was crazy
[01:23:16.920 --> 01:23:22.040]  exactly because they use the same security that they used for g7 it was
[01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:27.200]  obviously a complete overkill you could tell the police knew that within two or
[01:23:27.200 --> 01:23:32.320]  three days so it started to get more and more lax obviously the mountain police
[01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:34.880]  didn't know that because they were further away with the police that we
[01:23:34.880 --> 01:23:38.880]  dealt with you know some of them were cool some of them were mean to us but by
[01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:42.480]  the end of it they just really didn't give a damn as I said we went straight
[01:23:42.480 --> 01:23:46.360]  through the checkpoint on the last day as all the Bilderberg members were
[01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:51.560]  driving down they didn't even check our ID so it completely belies the notion
[01:23:51.560 --> 01:23:55.400]  that this was all necessary for the security of Bilderberg but remember it
[01:23:55.400 --> 01:23:59.240]  doesn't exist they still have publications writing articles Paul saying it
[01:23:59.240 --> 01:24:05.560]  doesn't even exist well the media in the past has harped on about the fact that
[01:24:05.560 --> 01:24:10.680]  it has no power and influence and for the first time I think this year there
[01:24:10.680 --> 01:24:14.800]  there have hardly been any news articles that try to claim that there's been a
[01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:20.240]  couple but in fact if you look at Jose Manuel Barroso the Prime Minister of
[01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:24.360]  Portugal former EU Commission head yesterday it was announced that he's
[01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:29.480]  been appointed as a steering committee member and in fact Sol SOL one of
[01:24:29.480 --> 01:24:35.520]  Portugal's major newspaper said that this appointment held equal importance
[01:24:35.520 --> 01:24:42.200]  and influence as his position at the EU Commission so again he's now a steering
[01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:46.880]  committee member he has equal or more power being a steering committer when
[01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:51.040]  a steering committee member like Franco Barnaby of the Rothschilds is as big as
[01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:55.960]  being EU president I mean this is ridiculous or bigger they even suggested
[01:24:55.960 --> 01:25:02.440]  that it was bigger so Tillman got the Barnaby confrontation which we go then
[01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:06.720]  we were at the airport they were actually going into the airport eating at the
[01:25:06.720 --> 01:25:11.400]  cafe in the departure lounge before you go through security where there's a
[01:25:11.400 --> 01:25:16.360]  flight deck observation where you can see the planes taking off a landing and
[01:25:16.360 --> 01:25:20.640]  they were just sitting there drinking coffee and both Tillman and Rob Dew were
[01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:24.720]  able to just walk up to them and have confrontations and conversations with
[01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:30.560]  them again so in comparison to previous years this and in particular this final
[01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:36.080]  day is the closest we've got to confronting Bilderberg members and
[01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:41.720]  having actual conversations with them and in the case of Barnaby he cited
[01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:46.120]  Chatham House rules if you actually read what Chatham House rules means it's
[01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:50.640]  you can say what happened but you can't say who said what but he claimed that
[01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:54.480]  because of these Chatham House rules he can say a word again a complete lie
[01:25:54.480 --> 01:25:59.640]  incorrect he's obviously paranoid about the fact that if he speaks out if he
[01:25:59.640 --> 01:26:03.600]  lets anything slip then he's not he's no longer going to be I mean let's face it
[01:26:03.600 --> 01:26:09.600]  you're you're getting in the face of global real corporate mafia dons and so
[01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:14.200]  you guys are very arrogant they're very arrogant you say you've got some of the
[01:26:14.200 --> 01:26:17.080]  local reporters that did some of this you want to interview somebody Paul you
[01:26:17.080 --> 01:26:20.440]  want to bring somebody in right now or who should I talk to next yeah we'll
[01:26:20.440 --> 01:26:24.360]  bring Rob Dew in for that interview in a moment but yeah they're arrogant I mean
[01:26:24.360 --> 01:26:29.040]  we Rob confronted another individual up there on the observation deck call
[01:26:29.040 --> 01:26:34.640]  Oscar Bronner who is the Austrian media mogul he owns Dersh Standard and he was
[01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:39.120]  traveling with Carl Savelda Bronner didn't say very much but Savelda was
[01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:44.600]  more chatty and in fact he said when Rob asked him his name he held up his name
[01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:51.160]  tag and said can you read so again complete arrogance everyone we confronted
[01:26:51.160 --> 01:26:56.600]  basically showed that arrogance so again we we got numerous confrontations they
[01:26:56.600 --> 01:27:02.360]  showed their arrogance and they've been exposed completely as TPP begins to
[01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:10.080]  crumble we've had more access than ever before at Bilderberg 2015 well it's just
[01:27:10.080 --> 01:27:15.760]  unprecedented and it's funny how we got the least amount of info because of all
[01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:19.080]  the security this time but then got the most at the end it just shows that
[01:27:19.080 --> 01:27:24.560]  perseverance is what matters it's what comes through I've got Joe Beggs coming
[01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:28.160]  in here to report to the next segments I want to get this rolling but great job
[01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:31.920]  guys you're going back to the UK tomorrow Rob do and Josh shows are coming back
[01:27:31.920 --> 01:27:35.600]  here to Austin Texas and we'll have more of the HD footage more of the
[01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:39.640]  confrontations going up in the morning I know you guys will try to stay up late
[01:27:39.640 --> 01:27:42.480]  it's like midnight there but just go ahead and go to bed get it up tomorrow
[01:27:42.480 --> 01:27:48.200]  great job there's still tons of stuff in info wars.com that just broke today but
[01:27:48.200 --> 01:27:51.320]  thank you so much Paul anything else you'd like to add before we briefly come
[01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:57.360]  back and talk to Rob do and that other reporter now just the fact that again the
[01:27:57.360 --> 01:28:00.800]  most paranoia was centered around the conference itself because they're
[01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:04.440]  desperate to avoid leaks from the conference they don't actually care
[01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:09.080]  about physical threats to Bilderberg as that's why it was such a ring of steel
[01:28:09.080 --> 01:28:12.160]  and encampment because they didn't want anyone getting caught. They care about the
[01:28:12.160 --> 01:28:16.040]  criminal meeting with the banking regulators meeting with the banks that
[01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:19.960]  have been indicted. And Rob will talk about this more but we went back to the
[01:28:19.960 --> 01:28:23.960]  hotel tonight where it was open though I know checkpoints we got in we were
[01:28:23.960 --> 01:28:27.600]  immediately kicked out and Rob can tell you more about that soon. And we played
[01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:30.240]  the footage of that we're going to break in 30 seconds we'll come back really
[01:28:30.240 --> 01:28:35.400]  hard to do and others and we've got Joe Biggs here to break down the media
[01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:40.160]  blaming conspiracy theorist if you slip on a banana peel it's conspiracy
[01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:44.120]  theorist for the attack on the Dallas police station it's all coming up you
[01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:47.640]  know we're those conspiracy theorists that go to the imaginary meeting with the
[01:28:47.640 --> 01:28:53.080]  troops and the helicopter and the thousands of police and the gunships and
[01:28:53.080 --> 01:28:56.880]  the radar jamming and the cell phone jamming yeah it's all imaginary it
[01:28:56.880 --> 01:29:02.720]  doesn't exist. Ladies and gentlemen you haven't really ever heard firearms
[01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:06.120]  manufacturers and sponsors on my syndicated radio show or the nightly
[01:29:06.120 --> 01:29:10.200]  news or the news website info wars.com because the companies I've been
[01:29:10.200 --> 01:29:14.720]  approached by were not the highest quality and they weren't as affordable as
[01:29:14.720 --> 01:29:19.480]  they should be so I refused probably 30-40 firearms manufacturers over the
[01:29:19.480 --> 01:29:24.440]  years will then about six months ago we get contacted by head down firearms

[01:33:18.240 --> 01:33:22.640]  immediately and say the Dallas police department attack was a false flag but
[01:33:22.640 --> 01:33:26.720]  joe begs went there and you add it to the information I have it doesn't look
[01:33:26.720 --> 01:33:32.400]  good we don't know who's false flagging but it's leaning that way and joe begs
[01:33:32.400 --> 01:33:36.640]  is combat veteran even the police chief of Dallas said that we thought people
[01:33:36.640 --> 01:33:41.720]  were shooting from an elevated position this story just does not add up we're
[01:33:41.720 --> 01:33:45.320]  gonna talk about about five minutes obviously if they're not on planes
[01:33:45.320 --> 01:33:49.000]  tomorrow I'll have them on to debrief what happened at belterberg we're
[01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:54.280]  limited on time right now but we've got Rob do now joining us who's been there
[01:33:54.280 --> 01:33:58.120]  since last Sunday and of course Josh Owens and they're talking to one of
[01:33:58.120 --> 01:34:01.640]  the local European reporters that got so many of these amazing interviews so
[01:34:01.640 --> 01:34:06.520]  Rob we got about five minutes finish up with what happened to you today overall
[01:34:06.520 --> 01:34:11.000]  belterberg news and tell us about this reporter that got so much footage sure
[01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:15.000]  well it was it was an amazing day today at the airport and we got a lot of
[01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:19.000]  footage and we met a guy at mr. Tillman who's a reporter from Germany and he
[01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:22.840]  said hey I've got a confrontation with Franco Barnaby let's check it out we
[01:34:22.840 --> 01:34:26.960]  went up we were editing it up in the cafe and that just as we had finished we
[01:34:26.960 --> 01:34:30.800]  were exporting it out and getting ready to upload it to YouTube and then ox walks
[01:34:30.800 --> 01:34:37.600]  in Roscoe Oscar Bronner Carl Svelta and Rudolph Shulton Rudolph Shulton and
[01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:41.280]  Carl Svelta are these big international bankers Oscar Bronner is the
[01:34:41.280 --> 01:34:45.160]  publisher for for the standard and I immediately saw Oscar Bronner because I
[01:34:45.160 --> 01:34:48.840]  recognized him and I said there he is Tillman was so quick on the draw he put
[01:34:48.840 --> 01:34:52.280]  his memory card back in his camera and was up before I could even get out of my
[01:34:52.280 --> 01:34:56.920]  chair confronting mr. Shulton and then I went up and confronted Oscar
[01:34:56.920 --> 01:34:59.760]  Bronner asking if he was gonna actually spill the beans on what really goes on
[01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:03.200]  in belterberg and I said you know you need to come clean otherwise people are
[01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:05.480]  gonna keep asking you questions about this and confronting you and he goes
[01:35:05.480 --> 01:35:11.200]  don't worry I am clean you know just in this typical Austrian bodaciousness that
[01:35:11.200 --> 01:35:14.040]  that I've been seeing from the cops here you know these people on the upper
[01:35:14.040 --> 01:35:16.360]  echelon just think they're better than everyone else and it's totally
[01:35:16.360 --> 01:35:21.440]  disgusting but I want to bring the over mention yeah exactly so here's mr.
[01:35:21.440 --> 01:35:26.240]  Tillman he actually I really respect what he did he's got a camera cost him
[01:35:26.240 --> 01:35:29.240]  about 80 euros but he was still able to get probably two of the biggest
[01:35:29.240 --> 01:35:33.960]  confrontations at belterberg so Tillman let me ask you a question how how did
[01:35:33.960 --> 01:35:36.600]  you feel when you were confronting these guys what what was going through your
[01:35:36.600 --> 01:35:41.200]  mind I mean yeah it went all pretty fast so it was actually by accident so I
[01:35:41.200 --> 01:35:45.880]  was actually wanted to pick up a friend at the airport at the train station and
[01:35:45.880 --> 01:35:51.160]  then a car from the inter-art and pulls up on me and there's a guy coming out who
[01:35:51.160 --> 01:35:56.440]  looks kind of familiar to me so I knew him because he walked out also 2011 in
[01:35:56.440 --> 01:36:02.880]  Switzerland so I knew I got a builder burger here so and I know at the app at
[01:36:02.880 --> 01:36:07.480]  the train station no one can protect him and he had no bodyguards no police he
[01:36:07.480 --> 01:36:12.800]  was totally coverless so I was I just thought okay let's let's attack him as
[01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:17.600]  long as possible so I really made like 12 minute footage and I also have a
[01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:21.440]  YouTube channel in Germany I confront politicians too so I'm used to this ever
[01:36:21.440 --> 01:36:25.720]  sad yeah I'd stay I'd stay on them so I'm telling your YouTube channel it's
[01:36:25.720 --> 01:36:29.960]  called burger back it's like German we are changed it's like my own project and
[01:36:29.960 --> 01:36:34.600]  I do this with a lower budget and a smaller camera but I confronted
[01:36:34.600 --> 01:36:37.720]  politicians from the Green Party the last a big heart you're having a big
[01:36:37.720 --> 01:36:42.560]  fact he's on mostly build a back because it's like an easy question to ask so yeah
[01:36:42.560 --> 01:36:45.960]  exactly and that's the thing he's doing it with a you know a smaller
[01:36:45.960 --> 01:36:49.680]  inexpensive camera but he's still confronting people and I tell you the
[01:36:49.680 --> 01:36:53.880]  Burnaby confrontation is big because it just shows how bodacious these guys
[01:36:53.880 --> 01:36:57.600]  these guys are at the end of the day and this was a Rothschild you bagged a
[01:36:57.600 --> 01:37:03.960]  Rothschild at Bilderberg because they now farm that out because they're so
[01:37:03.960 --> 01:37:08.120]  inbred they can hardly know the point is is that I mean this is one of the head
[01:37:08.120 --> 01:37:12.520]  globalist he's on the Bilderberg scaring committee this is a big deal so we
[01:37:12.520 --> 01:37:17.720]  salute you good job you actually confronted a major mafia don yeah and I
[01:37:17.720 --> 01:37:21.160]  think what's big is that he didn't take no for an answer he didn't back down he
[01:37:21.160 --> 01:37:24.760]  kept and he started preaching to him about what's going on at Bilderberg he
[01:37:24.760 --> 01:37:27.520]  did the same thing with mr. Shulton mr. Shulton didn't really want to talk to
[01:37:27.520 --> 01:37:30.800]  him but he just kept saying more and more and more and just letting him know
[01:37:30.800 --> 01:37:33.800]  that the people do not agree with what's going on a bill hey I don't think the
[01:37:33.800 --> 01:37:37.080]  Bilderbergs are too happy about TPP being in deep trouble and being voted down
[01:37:37.080 --> 01:37:40.680]  Friday I want you to get a full interview with him that will air when you get
[01:37:40.680 --> 01:37:44.440]  back this week we'll also debrief all you on air but this is one of the most
[01:37:44.440 --> 01:37:48.760]  successful Bilderbergs ever great job they've got to really be upset their
[01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:52.760]  agenda all over the places in so much trouble and they're now identified I
[01:37:52.760 --> 01:37:56.240]  mean once they're identified it's the beginning of the end we're not just
[01:37:56.240 --> 01:37:59.680]  obsessed with soccer players and football players it's the beginning of the
[01:37:59.680 --> 01:38:03.520]  end of this shadow corporate world government totally agree Alex and it
[01:38:03.520 --> 01:38:07.520]  was quite an ordeal dealing with these people all all day and all night and
[01:38:07.520 --> 01:38:10.760]  now we finally have some I think some peace and just getting these
[01:38:10.760 --> 01:38:13.960]  confrontations out in the open and letting people know what these people
[01:38:13.960 --> 01:38:17.360]  really think they think of us as kind of dirt this guy Oscar Bronner really
[01:38:17.360 --> 01:38:20.240]  didn't want to talk to me he was kind of looking down at me who are you with and
[01:38:20.240 --> 01:38:23.880]  then Carl Savelle that's taking pictures right in my face like I'm a
[01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:27.720]  criminal when he's one of the criminals here well con artists always have their
[01:38:27.720 --> 01:38:32.720]  bravado their hooks that's all they got and you know not all powerful people are
[01:38:32.720 --> 01:38:37.120]  scum like that but but these type of folks that work in these combines they
[01:38:37.120 --> 01:38:40.280]  have to stay in for the public if billerberg's all about hurting the public
[01:38:40.280 --> 01:38:44.840]  it's a eugenicist global plan they don't just discuss money there it's about the
[01:38:44.840 --> 01:38:49.480]  larger depopulation program their own documents have been ferried out they've
[01:38:49.480 --> 01:38:53.440]  been blown wide open they're in deep trouble I salute you all and Josh Owens
[01:38:53.440 --> 01:38:56.840]  if you guys have time tomorrow and aren't on a plane yet I want to interview
[01:38:56.840 --> 01:39:02.080]  you guys as well but regardless Tuesday in studio great job man I want to come
[01:39:02.080 --> 01:39:05.880]  in a job you've done all right we'll see you then all right thank you so much
[01:39:05.880 --> 01:39:09.240]  great job mr. Tellman good to meet you and there were so many other citizen
[01:39:09.240 --> 01:39:13.080]  journalists out there that are having a big effect I see it as more honorable
[01:39:13.080 --> 01:39:18.440]  when you're a citizen journalist with a hundred dollar camera or 80 euro camera
[01:39:18.440 --> 01:39:23.240]  or whatever it is then when you're a big horde out New York Times of Germany like
[01:39:23.240 --> 01:39:28.920]  this Bronner guy as Matt drudges always said every blogger every person with a
[01:39:28.920 --> 01:39:33.400]  camera every youtuber is just as important as the New York Times well the
[01:39:33.400 --> 01:39:37.840]  New York Times is so discredited we're more important we don't put on all these
[01:39:37.840 --> 01:39:43.520]  airs in an act we're here take an action you didn't see mainstream media getting
[01:39:43.520 --> 01:39:46.840]  up at seven in the morning or six in the morning drive to Dallas and cover the
[01:39:46.840 --> 01:39:52.000]  the events up there with the shooting we did because that's what real journalists
[01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:57.240]  used to do now media just waits for a press release from the police or from
[01:39:57.240 --> 01:40:01.640]  the government and regurgitates it all right Joe Biggs we only got about three
[01:40:01.640 --> 01:40:05.640]  minutes to break you'll have the next segment you and I both were like might
[01:40:05.640 --> 01:40:09.560]  be a crazy angry about something we'll see then they told us oh it was his own
[01:40:09.560 --> 01:40:13.720]  makeshift armored vehicle and oh well that's not true and then none of it adds
[01:40:13.720 --> 01:40:17.520]  up now the bullet angles I saw this on the news myself and I'm a shooter I know
[01:40:17.520 --> 01:40:21.880]  what stuff looks like but you're an expert combat vet multiple tours what do
[01:40:21.880 --> 01:40:26.320]  you make of the whole situation now they're in raw story saying that James
[01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:30.880]  Boulware was a conspiracy theorist by tomorrow morning you're gonna hear
[01:40:30.880 --> 01:40:34.760]  Alex Jones listener I said they keep saying people are gonna attack police
[01:40:34.760 --> 01:40:38.240]  departments with no history of this they're gonna blame the Patriots Jade
[01:40:38.240 --> 01:40:42.160]  Helms coming up I said if that narrative continues we know it may be staged
[01:40:42.160 --> 01:40:46.600]  well a lot of red lights are going off here Joe Biggs yeah yeah when I first
[01:40:46.600 --> 01:40:49.240]  got out there was kind of hard to tell you know I was looking at a lot of the
[01:40:49.240 --> 01:40:53.160]  evidence that I could listen to the different stories reading the different
[01:40:53.160 --> 01:40:55.640]  articles in the area most of the police weren't saying anything because they said
[01:40:55.640 --> 01:40:59.520]  the FBI was still conducting a an ongoing investigation they were still
[01:40:59.520 --> 01:41:02.760]  picking up evidence they were doing a lot of things like that and then we found
[01:41:02.760 --> 01:41:06.480]  out hey around three o'clock we're gonna allow you guys to select a number of you
[01:41:06.480 --> 01:41:10.360]  journalists we're gonna take your name the association that you work for and
[01:41:10.360 --> 01:41:14.080]  we're gonna bring in a reporter and a cameraman we're gonna allow you to walk
[01:41:14.080 --> 01:41:18.120]  through the crime scene to each individual spot where they're shooting the game
[01:41:18.120 --> 01:41:22.720]  and we're not saying the average cops are involved yeah let's be clear but one
[01:41:22.720 --> 01:41:26.840]  of the big things was what I noticed is we we got to the police vehicle that was
[01:41:26.840 --> 01:41:31.920]  fired upon now the police vehicle was facing the police department the front
[01:41:31.920 --> 01:41:36.560]  of the police department when you were showing photos you took on screen yeah
[01:41:36.560 --> 01:41:40.840]  when you look at the bullet holes that were at the front of the windshield now
[01:41:40.840 --> 01:41:45.480]  there were two officers in that vehicle there was a driver and a passenger now
[01:41:45.480 --> 01:41:49.360]  how they survived this you know like they say there's no atheists in Foxhole I'm
[01:41:49.360 --> 01:41:52.040]  pretty sure these guys didn't believe in God they found them really quick yeah
[01:41:52.040 --> 01:41:54.640]  we're not saying the attack was fake this could have killed somebody yeah
[01:41:54.640 --> 01:41:59.360]  barely missed them two of the rounds came right through the the windshield into
[01:41:59.360 --> 01:42:03.160]  where the driver would have been through there and out the back into the back seat
[01:42:03.160 --> 01:42:08.360]  now the the bolt holes in the windshield are high a couple low which means
[01:42:08.360 --> 01:42:11.400]  they would have had a straight you know triangulation going through but there
[01:42:11.400 --> 01:42:16.720]  was two that came from a high angle and then the two exit holes in the back of
[01:42:16.720 --> 01:42:19.960]  the seat where that fiberglass areas where they use protect you know from a
[01:42:19.960 --> 01:42:24.640]  passenger in the back where the very bottom so if this guy was standing up
[01:42:24.640 --> 01:42:27.680]  there's no way he could have shot around and then it kind of you know went
[01:42:27.680 --> 01:42:31.480]  down so the firing unless it's a magic bullet yeah unless it's a magic Dallas
[01:42:31.480 --> 01:42:35.800]  does have magic bullets apparently yeah I mean that one hit Kennedy like five
[01:42:35.800 --> 01:42:40.680]  times yeah the grassy know that fell out on damage on the stretcher yeah I mean
[01:42:40.680 --> 01:42:46.360]  these things there was either no cops in that car and that's a complete lie in
[01:42:46.360 --> 01:42:50.840]  the story or these are two of the luckiest men well the world I saw it this
[01:42:50.840 --> 01:42:53.800]  morning I don't have time to scramble and get it I just clicked though the
[01:42:53.800 --> 01:42:57.520]  police chief came out I've met him he's pretty nice guy he said that he thinks
[01:42:57.520 --> 01:43:00.360]  there might have been people up higher shooting we're coming right back when

[01:47:28.160 --> 01:47:58.120]  network waging war on corruption well if you go to Dallas as our reporters did physically jacari jackson will be in studio as well tomorrow we're going to break more of this down and you've got bullets coming in at the top of the car and then they go down at an angle and they're supposedly shot from gun ports that are basically at the same level as the police car so they should be going through with a flat trajectory you know there's a cover up and we'll have this by tomorrow the police chief saying we thought they were
[01:47:58.120 --> 01:48:21.120]  shooting from roofs so that shows the police department probably isn't involved in this they don't know what's going on and I'm not from my experience you don't see like departments staging false flags you see globalist organizations doing it giving an official narrative to the department then the van races away they first said that it was a you know something
[01:48:21.120 --> 01:48:39.120]  he'd made turns out he bought it on ebay you know he had no job and was bankrupt and it's a armored van that like police or others would use you can buy these on the civilian market might be a good vehicle for the enforce crew actually here's the headline worded unemployed mechanic
[01:48:39.120 --> 01:49:06.120]  bullware get money to buy zombie apocalypse assault vehicle families that attack or don't have money to pay for mental health care so he may just be a mental patient cut out of some other group and you add jade helm coming up with quote the military simulating illegal activities I'm not saying that's what's happening but they use drills as a cover and other weird stuff's going on Joe Biggs you've got the floor for the final eight minutes this is bombshell you got video and photos with your
[01:49:06.120 --> 01:49:20.120]  car will have it all in HD tomorrow for folks on the on the weekday show we're just codifying this now but at first we thought just other crazy nut it's starting to look suspicious you even said that yeah once you actually get out there and look at the evidence and you get you know boots on the ground and you're able to look
[01:49:20.120 --> 01:49:35.120]  at these different scenes it just doesn't add up and like I said the biggest thing is the trajectory of those bullets coming through it doesn't add up that this guy was shooting an assault rifle through these port holes in the side of a van van doesn't sit down you can't physically shoot down
[01:49:35.120 --> 01:49:47.120]  that angle issues on the roof I mean he would have had to have been like right there parked on the very front of the hood like just had driven right on the hood to be able to get that kind of an angle I know but I'm looking at the
[01:49:47.120 --> 01:50:04.120]  porch that wouldn't even be at that angle to shoot that way down I mean maybe they were saying that he was firing towards the police department and then I'm assuming at that point in time you heard the car come and then that's when he had turned around and apparently started you know shooting at
[01:50:04.120 --> 01:50:14.120]  the police vehicle but like I said once you get out there at first they brought us to the front of the police the police vehicle then they brought us to the front of the police department where it was just riddled with bullet holes all over the
[01:50:14.120 --> 01:50:28.120]  whole front and they said that is not reinforced it's not bulletproof whatsoever it went those rounds went through that into the front desk where there would have been you know like ladies that civilians working to process people you know help them at the front desk
[01:50:28.120 --> 01:50:42.120]  went through that and into other offices as well then they took us down to the next area where the bag that had the pipe bomb went off in the parking lot and you could see bits of screw PVC pipe all this different stuff it
[01:50:42.120 --> 01:50:56.120]  completely took out the front in a vehicle and smashed some windows and some surrounding vehicles and they brought us back around and then brought us to the left rear side of the police vehicle where you could see where the bullet went all say this
[01:50:56.120 --> 01:51:08.120]  them letting you in so quick does not add to it being a false flag but again the department's probably not involved in this when you look at staged events they'll have the cut out in the vehicle somebody else gets out before he gets caught
[01:51:08.120 --> 01:51:20.120]  or that they leave a dead body in the van later and then call on the tip to the police I mean I've seen this done in other countries I've seen it done here it may not be a false flag but it's just not adding up and part of your homework Joe as you can do it
[01:51:20.120 --> 01:51:30.120]  I saw that clip this morning it's on info wars in one of the articles the police chief gave a press conference he talked about believing there were other shooters up higher so the police are obviously noticing the same thing
[01:51:30.120 --> 01:51:44.120]  there's a bunch of apartment complexes and lofts that you can rent surrounding the police department right there so there's a lot of high vantage points for something like that to happen but like I said the police vehicle was facing the police station so that meant that
[01:51:44.120 --> 01:51:55.120]  shots had to have been fired from the police station to get that angle down at repeat what you told me earlier yet because I interrupt you explain the bullets are an angle we have the photos they're from up high
[01:51:55.120 --> 01:52:05.120]  that's even bigger the angle is from the department yes from the department I mean no explain it there's there's no way because the way the vehicle pulled up it was facing the front of the Dallas police department right there
[01:52:05.120 --> 01:52:19.120]  so the angle when you look at where the bullets come through through the windshield to where the driver would be sitting through the back seat and out the back you can see how the metal tore how it came from a high trajectory so it had to have been because the police vehicle was aiming
[01:52:19.120 --> 01:52:30.120]  pointing towards the front of the vehicle I would have had to have come from there you told me months ago that when you were in Iraq and Afghanistan that sometimes if you just got shot at once I don't remember the story we're out having a beer
[01:52:30.120 --> 01:52:40.120]  that you'd stop the Humvees and then you could once security got set up see the angle and pretty much find out where it came from to go find the people yeah I mean so so that's where your skill on this comes from but
[01:52:40.120 --> 01:52:50.120]  exactly anybody can see where bullets coming in yeah I mean what angle well I mean a lot of the reporters out there were asking some of those cupcake questions I mean I was just in awe of how stupid that entire thing went
[01:52:50.120 --> 01:53:01.120]  you know what do you think you're just some of the dumbest stuff and I'm sitting there saying that looks like a 308 maybe a 762 is like a 308 assault rifle or probably a collision of cough or something like that
[01:53:01.120 --> 01:53:09.120]  the guy would have had to been elevated and then one of the camera guys was an old Vietnam bit and he goes yeah that's what I was thinking too it had to have come from a high
[01:53:09.120 --> 01:53:15.120]  oh I forgot you went to a press conference as you get any questions in of why are the bullets coming in an angle from the top
[01:53:15.120 --> 01:53:25.120]  they wouldn't let us ask anything that didn't have to do with just the crime scene itself it had to be about actual that okay why are the bullets coming in from an angle
[01:53:25.120 --> 01:53:31.120]  as soon as anyone would ask something like that they said no no no we'll answer that another time they wouldn't ask anything like that they wouldn't answer anything
[01:53:31.120 --> 01:53:40.120]  for those that I know you could stick pencils in there and see the angle oh yeah I mean I could see it that's what they do I mean they let me get right close to it I looked at it it came from high up it had to have come from a
[01:53:40.120 --> 01:53:47.120]  high up they wouldn't let anybody in there I think notice notice the rot rally they're still not releasing any of that footage you're letting me out
[01:53:47.120 --> 01:53:54.120]  if the wake up you know not the rot roll the wake up thing yeah one of those being a walk rally you saw on Friday night with sniper rivals downtown
[01:53:54.120 --> 01:54:03.120]  yeah they were walking up and down the street with a yes these sniper rifles attached to their backpack and these are the same guys in green uniforms that we saw in Waco
[01:54:03.120 --> 01:54:08.080]  those are the ones that assaulted like it was Normandy on this Twin Peaks.
[01:54:08.080 --> 01:54:11.720]  And that was one of the questions I had before that, is it going to be handled the same way?
[01:54:11.720 --> 01:54:12.720]  And luckily-
[01:54:12.720 --> 01:54:15.080]  Somebody shoots, he just shoots the crowd.
[01:54:15.080 --> 01:54:16.080]  And then seal everything.
[01:54:16.080 --> 01:54:17.720]  Now, that's definitely a cover-up.
[01:54:17.720 --> 01:54:21.160]  But one of the things I did think was one of the most suspicious things was the fact
[01:54:21.160 --> 01:54:24.000]  that it was an ongoing crime scene.
[01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:28.320]  You're letting people outside come in that could possibly contaminate it.
[01:54:28.320 --> 01:54:30.920]  They could come back later and say, one of these reporters touched something.
[01:54:30.920 --> 01:54:34.800]  You see, I see it as they're not covering it up.
[01:54:34.800 --> 01:54:38.200]  So maybe it's true, but you're saying, and I get what you're saying, why let you into
[01:54:38.200 --> 01:54:39.200]  a crime scene?
[01:54:39.200 --> 01:54:44.120]  Yeah, because they had the FBI right there, the FBI crime scene investigators were on
[01:54:44.120 --> 01:54:45.120]  scene.
[01:54:45.120 --> 01:54:50.200]  They had these different devices out that measure the angles and all this stuff.
[01:54:50.200 --> 01:54:53.640]  And there was a, you know, shrapnel all over the ground, and we were just walking over
[01:54:53.640 --> 01:54:54.640]  it.
[01:54:54.640 --> 01:54:55.640]  The cops were like, oh, it's okay.
[01:54:55.640 --> 01:54:56.640]  Just walk over here.
[01:54:56.640 --> 01:54:59.400]  Just if you see a white piece of paper with a number on it, just don't step on that part.
[01:54:59.400 --> 01:55:03.240]  But we're walking through essentially contaminating a crime scene, and yet there's no problem
[01:55:03.240 --> 01:55:04.240]  with that.
[01:55:04.240 --> 01:55:07.440]  You know, anytime I've been to any kind of thing like this before, it takes days before
[01:55:07.440 --> 01:55:08.440]  they let you in.
[01:55:08.440 --> 01:55:12.520]  I thought that was one of the most suspicious things is that the day of they're bringing
[01:55:12.520 --> 01:55:14.640]  20, 30 people through.
[01:55:14.640 --> 01:55:18.480]  Well, part of it is the guys did.
[01:55:18.480 --> 01:55:20.000]  But no, I see what you're saying.
[01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.360]  See, I was thinking they're not covering it up.
[01:55:22.360 --> 01:55:23.360]  So maybe they're telling the truth.
[01:55:23.360 --> 01:55:24.360]  But I get your point.
[01:55:24.360 --> 01:55:26.200]  Why would they just let you in?
[01:55:26.200 --> 01:55:30.920]  But that kind of bodes towards it being real because everybody's, you know, reality is a
[01:55:30.920 --> 01:55:31.920]  lot more disjointed.
[01:55:31.920 --> 01:55:32.920]  I tell you, it's confusing.
[01:55:32.920 --> 01:55:35.960]  Well, I mean, what about the angle of these bullets?
[01:55:35.960 --> 01:55:36.960]  That's really suspicious.
[01:55:36.960 --> 01:55:37.960]  Yeah.
[01:55:37.960 --> 01:55:41.480]  I mean, we just remembered back this past Thanksgiving, we had a similar incident here
[01:55:41.480 --> 01:55:44.280]  in Austin, Texas, downtown of the police department.
[01:55:44.280 --> 01:55:45.280]  A guy came in.
[01:55:45.280 --> 01:55:47.560]  I had just gotten back with Jakari from Ferguson.
[01:55:47.560 --> 01:55:48.840]  It was in November.
[01:55:48.840 --> 01:55:50.280]  We had just gotten back and landed.
[01:55:50.280 --> 01:55:52.280]  I'm like, all right, I'm tired of being shot at.
[01:55:52.280 --> 01:55:56.160]  I need to go downtown on 6th Street, have a beer, relax, and just get away from all
[01:55:56.160 --> 01:55:57.160]  the gunfire.
[01:55:57.160 --> 01:55:59.720]  And some guy comes through and downtown Austin.
[01:55:59.720 --> 01:56:02.720]  And when I was just at the police department the other day, bullet holes rippled all across
[01:56:02.720 --> 01:56:05.440]  the front, hasn't been repaired.
[01:56:05.440 --> 01:56:08.080]  And you know, it's just, it's crazy.
[01:56:08.080 --> 01:56:10.240]  They still haven't repaired the police department?
[01:56:10.240 --> 01:56:11.240]  No.
[01:56:11.240 --> 01:56:12.240]  Not at all.
[01:56:12.240 --> 01:56:15.400]  It's all over the inside window when you go up and like hand them your ID to say, hey,
[01:56:15.400 --> 01:56:16.400]  I've gotten a ticket.
[01:56:16.400 --> 01:56:17.400]  I need to pay for this.
[01:56:17.400 --> 01:56:18.400]  This is who I am.
[01:56:18.400 --> 01:56:20.720]  Bullets all over their holes, all through there.
[01:56:20.720 --> 01:56:21.800]  What a country.
[01:56:21.800 --> 01:56:23.640]  And why is it all happening in Texas?
[01:56:23.640 --> 01:56:24.640]  Something's going on.
[01:56:24.640 --> 01:56:28.920]  You know, Jade Helm was labeled hostile and it seems funny ever since we came out with
[01:56:28.920 --> 01:56:34.560]  these documents saying that Jade Helm is or that Texas was hostile on the Jade Helm documents.
[01:56:34.560 --> 01:56:35.760]  Everything's been going crazy.
[01:56:35.760 --> 01:56:39.920]  Garland, you know, McKinney, the Dallas shootings, all these different things keep happening
[01:56:39.920 --> 01:56:40.920]  in Texas.
[01:56:40.920 --> 01:56:43.000]  Texas looks pretty hostile to me now.
[01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:46.240]  It looks like they're getting what they wanted.
[01:56:46.240 --> 01:56:49.560]  Well, we don't know what's happened here.
[01:56:49.560 --> 01:56:50.720]  It just doesn't add up.
[01:56:50.720 --> 01:56:54.600]  I mean, it's just really, because I saw your photos this morning before even got back.
[01:56:54.600 --> 01:56:58.040]  And it said an angle and I'm going, those are in angles.
[01:56:58.040 --> 01:57:01.360]  And then even the police chief saying we thought they might have been on roofs because they
[01:57:01.360 --> 01:57:02.680]  were coming in down at an angle.
[01:57:02.680 --> 01:57:05.800]  Yeah, they changed your story actually about that two or three times yesterday because
[01:57:05.800 --> 01:57:09.480]  my initial reports that I heard were, yeah, we think there's multiple shooters because
[01:57:09.480 --> 01:57:14.600]  a lot of the witnesses out there said that, hey, we heard multiple gunfire from different
[01:57:14.600 --> 01:57:15.600]  areas.
[01:57:15.600 --> 01:57:17.600]  We think there's probably four shooters.
[01:57:17.600 --> 01:57:20.920]  And then one of the guys yesterday is like, no, no, no, we just think this is a lone gunman.
[01:57:20.920 --> 01:57:23.720]  There's no one else, you know, but now they're changing it again.
[01:57:23.720 --> 01:57:31.240]  So this is bigger, I tell you, Joe, let's try to codify this into an article into a video.
[01:57:31.240 --> 01:57:34.000]  I need you and Jacarie who were there both here tomorrow.
