[00:00.000 --> 00:15.000]  The answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[00:30.000 --> 00:43.480]  everything's happy everything's good world war 3 cometh Syria is threatening to
[00:43.480 --> 00:48.480]  bomb the airport in Tel Aviv and Iran is pledging to wipe Israel off the map now
[00:48.480 --> 00:52.560]  you know why the United States is pulling back like we always do before
[00:52.560 --> 00:58.720]  Israel gets into another war big things happening Venezuela on fire at least
[00:58.720 --> 01:04.280]  seven shot dead by the dictatorship that has been holding on to power through
[01:04.280 --> 01:09.120]  staged elections the country has been in a state of collapse for more than a
[01:09.120 --> 01:13.520]  decade and of course President Trump has recognized the opposition leader
[01:13.520 --> 01:19.240]  yesterday accelerating the crisis Russia and others because they have bases of
[01:19.240 --> 01:25.400]  Venezuela have condemned the United States but quite frankly Trump's move
[01:25.400 --> 01:30.920]  is right Maduro clearly is a dictator and a horrible globalist backed up by
[01:30.920 --> 01:34.640]  Hollywood and others so too bad for the Russians if the Venezuelan people
[01:34.640 --> 01:38.980]  actually get control of their government yeah there's Trump's second
[01:38.980 --> 01:44.040]  on inauguration video actually it's actually it's Caracas who are up to a
[01:44.040 --> 01:51.280]  million people flooded the streets now all CNN would have to do is just show a
[01:51.280 --> 01:55.280]  photo from the day before when no one was in the streets and say look no one is in
[01:55.280 --> 01:59.080]  the streets of Caracas that's what they did back on
[01:59.080 --> 02:04.800]  inauguration day 2017 remember they just showed it when the mall had first
[02:04.800 --> 02:09.640]  opened and said no one was there not showing the record crowd but I just
[02:09.640 --> 02:14.240]  thought that was a good point to make now imagine the military to try to
[02:14.240 --> 02:19.200]  disperse everybody shot at least seven people dead wounding many others many
[02:19.200 --> 02:22.800]  others drug off to dungeons that are already basically full of people as the
[02:22.800 --> 02:28.040]  country completely collapses epic footage we're gonna have shots of the
[02:28.040 --> 02:34.360]  armored vehicles exploding we're gonna have shots of the people being shot so
[02:34.360 --> 02:38.040]  viewer discretion advised that is coming up in the next segment we'll look more
[02:38.040 --> 02:45.240]  at Israel after a couple days of blaming the Covington Catholic school kids of
[02:45.240 --> 02:52.440]  being horrible demons the media then said okay maybe they weren't but they're
[02:52.440 --> 02:56.200]  still evil because they were in red hats and they're white well now they've
[02:56.200 --> 03:00.720]  doubled down all over the place New York Times you name it MSNBC and they go
[03:00.720 --> 03:05.560]  you know what those kids are bad and black guys calling them cracker asses
[03:05.560 --> 03:10.280]  and saying will harvest your organs is actually a good thing and the old Native
[03:10.280 --> 03:14.280]  American wizard coming over and breathing his horrible breath in the
[03:14.280 --> 03:18.360]  kids face and beating a drum that was loving and good so the New York Times
[03:18.360 --> 03:22.200]  and others have decided that actually it's a wonderful thing kind of like
[03:22.200 --> 03:26.360]  they're a board member that said whites are subhuman goblins that live in holes
[03:26.360 --> 03:29.560]  on the ground and she can't wait till we're all exterminated at first they
[03:29.560 --> 03:34.800]  said oh yeah this is wrong and they said you know what it's free speech but as
[03:34.800 --> 03:39.000]  long as an Asian or a black person or somebody's talking like a Nazi it's okay
[03:39.000 --> 03:45.040]  because again they can't be racist they are the anointed God people unbelievable
[03:45.040 --> 03:48.600]  so that's all coming up Paul Joseph Watson has a big article on it New York
[03:48.600 --> 03:55.440]  Times runs defense for black anti-Semite hate group so we're gonna be looking at
[03:55.440 --> 04:01.960]  all of that meanwhile a representative Elon Omar smears Covington boys days
[04:01.960 --> 04:06.360]  after it's all proven to be fraud they were taunting five black men doing
[04:06.360 --> 04:12.480]  Nazi salutes and more Channing build that wall what an idiot I mean these
[04:12.480 --> 04:18.440]  people are just unbelievable she's one of our first Muslim members of Congress
[04:18.440 --> 04:21.520]  they have to all be women of course in the Muslim countries the women aren't in
[04:21.520 --> 04:24.960]  their government but that's okay here they will be because Islam is for women
[04:24.960 --> 04:32.840]  chopping your genitals off and putting you in slave pits oh the joys owed to the
[04:32.840 --> 04:38.960]  joy of it all also we have a bunch of big special guest joining us here today

[06:04.800 --> 06:14.760]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide
[06:14.760 --> 06:19.120]  it's alex jones
[06:21.760 --> 06:29.760]  it's January 24th 2019 it's Thursday this is the alex jones show the most
[06:29.760 --> 06:35.640]  banned demonized line about broadcast in the world for a good reason
[06:35.640 --> 06:39.960]  emergency transmission from deep in the heart of Texas US resistance is the
[06:39.960 --> 06:43.960]  global corporate combine empowered and funded by communist China how I was a
[06:43.960 --> 06:48.680]  big mega banks that set up communist China in 1949 the communist Chinese have
[06:48.680 --> 06:51.960]  taken control of US telecommunications infrastructure the
[06:51.960 --> 06:55.280]  communist Chinese control of Hollywood the communist Chinese to control the
[06:55.280 --> 06:59.160]  main universities this is all confirmed this is not a drill big tech and
[06:59.160 --> 07:02.520]  Silicon Valley is almost completely run by the communist Chinese government
[07:02.520 --> 07:06.880]  it officially becomes state-run Apple 100% Google is now making the
[07:06.880 --> 07:11.640]  transition and announcing a merger and total worldwide censorship they're now
[07:11.640 --> 07:15.880]  beta testing using me as the straw man a demonized version of Alex Jones to do
[07:15.880 --> 07:19.680]  that this is happening this is not like the other probes before that we're meant
[07:19.680 --> 07:24.400]  to get you used to probes and censorship so you would adapt to censorship by just
[07:24.400 --> 07:28.720]  putting up with it now this attack is thousands and thousands and thousands of
[07:28.720 --> 07:33.680]  times the magnitude of all previous attacks this is a tie-traded dose reverse
[07:33.680 --> 07:38.760]  psychological warfare operation using a depth overcome subversion paradigm
[07:38.760 --> 07:43.240]  manipulation in layman's terms they are manipulating the fact that we adapt to
[07:43.240 --> 07:47.920]  being oppressed we adapt to being pressed the low dosages of oppression now
[07:47.920 --> 07:53.000]  when the megaton hits us of the total takeover we try to adapt to the poison
[07:53.000 --> 07:58.440]  infusion instead of not knowing it's a lethal dose if we accept the dose total
[07:58.440 --> 08:02.520]  Internet of things integration of social score complete management control
[08:02.520 --> 08:07.080]  system it is the virtual reality AI platform system now attacking the
[08:07.080 --> 08:11.280]  United States with traders inside the major security agencies blocking Trump's
[08:11.280 --> 08:15.120]  resistance of the program and attempting to stop us from removing the tentacles
[08:15.120 --> 08:19.640]  of the chai con slash big tech begging combine emergency situation I have been
[08:19.640 --> 08:22.800]  chosen for destruction because I brought you this information and have been
[08:22.800 --> 08:27.400]  battering ramming it out as much as I can they want to double use me as they
[08:27.400 --> 08:32.040]  always do in any complex system of mathematical deception where every
[08:32.040 --> 08:36.360]  angle of my good is turned against us so they take what I've said things here
[08:36.360 --> 08:40.800]  built me into an insincere person in the straw man a person that cares about life
[08:40.800 --> 08:45.000]  and children as against these wars so they make me a herder of children and
[08:45.000 --> 08:49.040]  they build me into this lie to then set the distraction all their actions
[08:49.040 --> 08:54.080]  censoring all of you to make a debate about Alex Jones so even if I didn't sell
[08:54.080 --> 08:58.840]  out to them they now use me as an archetype to serve them by being the
[08:58.840 --> 09:03.680]  main distraction I am now captured by the enemy in the information warfare
[09:03.680 --> 09:33.360]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man Thomas Jefferson if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[09:33.360 --> 09:48.000]  we're ready a listener you've heard that promo before why they banned Alex Jones
[09:48.000 --> 09:53.000]  but a cool YouTube website I hate even plugs they probably go ban it dare you
[09:53.000 --> 09:57.360]  even talk about info wars you dirty Americans keep your mouth shut there's
[09:57.360 --> 10:04.480]  no first amendment that's a channel called cartoon intro info tunes on YouTube
[10:04.480 --> 10:07.520]  we got some more of those will be playing today really interesting we are a
[10:07.520 --> 10:14.920]  radio program that is TV as well at info wars.com forward slash show and it's
[10:14.920 --> 10:20.840]  not just something we need it's essential like oxygen or water if we don't
[10:20.840 --> 10:26.880]  have this we're dead in the water we've been banned off of every major social
[10:26.880 --> 10:33.960]  network banned off Roku banned off everything based on lies based on Alex
[10:33.960 --> 10:38.800]  Jones is on his radio show saying go to the Sandy Hook parents homes and arrest
[10:38.800 --> 10:48.120]  them a I never said that and B they have the lawyers for them currently going
[10:48.120 --> 10:52.520]  all over the Washington Post New York Times CNN saying get him off the air
[10:52.520 --> 10:55.560]  every time they pick a new thing to target to say take me off the air Roku
[10:55.560 --> 10:59.320]  last week said no he's been on with us eight years or seven years we already
[10:59.320 --> 11:02.920]  had an app on there or a platform some fans made a new one it went to the
[11:02.920 --> 11:07.920]  front page it was so popular in one day and all these George Soros and Democrat
[11:07.920 --> 11:10.640]  groups bragged that they started lobbying to take it down and Roku said no
[11:10.640 --> 11:15.320]  we're just an internet platform so you can get stuff from the internet on your
[11:15.320 --> 11:21.940]  television you know now they're producing some of their own programs and so the
[11:21.940 --> 11:25.520]  lawyers then contacted him and bragged in the Washington Post that they told
[11:25.520 --> 11:29.200]  him he's currently viciously attacking us he's currently sending people to our
[11:29.200 --> 11:33.720]  houses help us well that's not a free speech issue that's like saying a local
[11:33.720 --> 11:37.840]  radio host is telling people go rob the bank it's no longer free speech you're
[11:37.840 --> 11:42.480]  now calling for criminal action didn't do it but see they're doing it through my
[11:42.480 --> 11:49.880]  name and my voice notice the news never shows you where I did that so now they
[11:49.880 --> 11:52.960]  have these groups looking like the grassroots organizations contacting our
[11:52.960 --> 11:58.440]  affiliates saying did you know he's currently saying go do this and that
[11:58.440 --> 12:04.360]  things I never did so it's a false report it's it's it's the definition of
[12:04.360 --> 12:09.680]  defamation to cause harm they are saying things that aren't true and saying it's
[12:09.680 --> 12:14.320]  to get me off the air some of the lawyers there's a morning just the
[12:14.320 --> 12:17.440]  afternoon it's not something I want to do but obviously I'm gonna have to take
[12:17.440 --> 12:21.600]  action because imagine if someone was filing reports that you were doing
[12:21.600 --> 12:25.320]  something you weren't and you reached out to them and you shot all these videos
[12:25.320 --> 12:29.560]  and reports and their response is to complain to YouTube to have your videos
[12:29.560 --> 12:37.080]  taken down where you clarify so that's what this is and they're not gonna stop
[12:37.080 --> 12:43.200]  so I absolutely need your prayers I need your support I need your financial
[12:43.200 --> 12:47.160]  support because if they're able to shut us down this is the model for everybody
[12:47.160 --> 12:53.800]  else so we really are a Americana example that is on the front lines and
[12:53.800 --> 12:57.520]  without you we will be defeated and we got some big guests coming up today we
[12:57.520 --> 13:03.600]  have the lawyer for the Covington Catholic school kids joining us coming up
[13:03.600 --> 13:09.800]  just a couple segments we all show he's about to file a bunch of lawsuits which
[13:09.800 --> 13:13.520]  absolutely need to be done this is clear go to their houses go to their schools
[13:13.520 --> 13:16.720]  kill them shoot them murder them the people don't even take this off
[13:16.720 --> 13:21.320]  Twitter fact they're doubling down the New York Times is defending the black
[13:21.320 --> 13:24.600]  racist group that was there screaming racist names at him and saying it's a
[13:24.600 --> 13:27.960]  good thing they did just like the New York Times board member says whites are
[13:27.960 --> 13:33.480]  subhuman so you cannot make this up so that's all coming up and we have a
[13:33.480 --> 13:37.760]  bunch of other big guests as well we have this big Hollywood case of men being
[13:37.760 --> 13:43.200]  raped men being abused boys being abused and famous Hollywood individuals
[13:43.200 --> 13:46.840]  saying no one will believe you that's now mainstream news and we've got one of
[13:46.840 --> 13:49.960]  the investigative journalist and filmmakers who's been working with the
[13:49.960 --> 13:55.040]  writers the story to expose it coming on we'll be naming names of confirmed
[13:55.040 --> 14:01.240]  admitted pedophilia rings rape you name it that is now starting to come out
[14:01.240 --> 14:03.680]  about Hollywood so that's why they want to shut us off air but it's not gonna
[14:03.680 --> 14:10.000]  work that transmission will be going out with Gabe Hoffman and Robert Barnes the
[14:10.000 --> 14:18.120]  lawyer for many of the Kentucky Catholic schoolboys I'll be here Katie Hopkins
[14:18.120 --> 14:23.440]  always amazing from the UK is gonna be joining us as well but just briefly
[14:23.440 --> 14:27.240]  going back to what I just mentioned if you're a TV or you can see this here's
[14:27.240 --> 14:32.640]  Ann Coulter a few days ago journalist in 2018 Alex Jones caused the families of
[14:32.640 --> 14:37.640]  sanded victims to be harassed he must be banned from all social media well they
[14:37.640 --> 14:42.880]  actually say I'm currently doing it okay even though that's not true and the
[14:42.880 --> 14:47.760]  prior isn't true then journalist in 2019 please kill these children and their
[14:47.760 --> 14:54.220]  families they're then kept on the internet that shows the leftist
[14:54.220 --> 14:59.560]  disconnect and we have an example of this one of these Hollywood individuals
[14:59.560 --> 15:03.680]  that we'll cover at the bottom of the hour the lawyer came out and made vile
[15:03.680 --> 15:08.360]  hateful statements towards the kids and hasn't retracted in fact he's doubled
[15:08.360 --> 15:13.240]  down as of this morning so we're gonna play the shocking video from his Twitter
[15:13.240 --> 15:18.920]  account tell you who he is the articles up on m4s.com he's a monstrous
[15:18.920 --> 15:22.240]  monstrous monstrous individual that we're gonna be breaking down at the
[15:22.240 --> 15:30.760]  bottom of the hour with the lawyer also turns out that the elder Nathan Phillips
[15:30.760 --> 15:35.200]  did say he was in combat in Vietnam so he is a complete liar we have video of
[15:35.200 --> 15:39.600]  that again Kathy Griffin is back down and removed her tweet saying go attack

[20:01.800 --> 20:22.760]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[20:22.760 --> 20:30.960]  alex jones here back lives Juan Guaido according to many international polling
[20:30.960 --> 20:36.120]  experts and witnesses won the last election even though they didn't even
[20:36.120 --> 20:41.280]  allow him to be on the ballot many areas in Venezuela there has been a one-party
[20:41.280 --> 20:45.080]  dictatorship at first said it was liberal then said it was socialist then
[20:45.080 --> 20:52.800]  said it was communist and you've got Maduro who is just a complete moron and
[20:52.800 --> 20:57.680]  extremely unpopular so what about Hugo Chavez he was very charismatic and had
[20:57.680 --> 21:02.240]  a very big following and he did originally get elected legitimately but
[21:02.240 --> 21:06.600]  with Maduro these have been fake elections and up to a thousand people a
[21:06.600 --> 21:09.720]  week starving to death they passed a law a few years ago you can't say people
[21:09.720 --> 21:14.360]  are starving to death they just say you die of exposure or die of the flu or die
[21:14.360 --> 21:19.960]  of something else five years ago all the zoos had their animals eaten around
[21:19.960 --> 21:23.200]  that same time all the cats and dogs disappeared now birds have disappeared
[21:23.200 --> 21:27.840]  insects are disappearing there's total collapse of society because communists
[21:27.840 --> 21:33.360]  shit on top of all the crops and all the fields and then give the people none of
[21:33.360 --> 21:38.280]  what they produce when they do the communists always shell it to foreign
[21:38.280 --> 21:42.800]  groups to make money because the communists all build lavish palaces in
[21:42.800 --> 21:50.320]  Spain and in Switzerland and in Morocco and other areas like that that's just
[21:50.320 --> 21:53.680]  what they do Australia I mean there's a lot of places they run to the United
[21:53.680 --> 22:02.120]  States and so this is the total corruption there have been cases of
[22:02.120 --> 22:08.520]  people hijacking trailers full of cows full of beef and just slaughtering them
[22:08.520 --> 22:13.120]  right there with machetes and just like zombies gobbling the meat that's what
[22:13.120 --> 22:17.640]  happens when you're starving to death and so if your TV viewer you can see the
[22:17.640 --> 22:22.640]  images of state-run media set a half million it looked like millions of
[22:22.640 --> 22:29.640]  people flooding all the major streets of Caracas and we can also roll some of the
[22:29.640 --> 22:33.880]  video of people being shot armored vehicles being hit by Molov cocktails
[22:33.880 --> 22:41.520]  this is truly a historic situation taking place this looks like scenes out of
[22:41.520 --> 22:48.560]  the Hunger Games armored vehicles citizens throwing rocks at the armored
[22:48.560 --> 22:54.360]  vehicles Molov cocktails the police and military shooting people hundreds and
[22:54.360 --> 22:58.080]  hundreds wounded we're hearing numbers of seven dead but that's government run
[22:58.080 --> 23:02.080]  media means probably 500 I mean who knows you never know with these communist
[23:02.080 --> 23:07.480]  countries and so yes I don't like American expansionism where we go take
[23:07.480 --> 23:11.600]  over Afghanistan for the tune of a trillion plus dollars it's been more
[23:11.600 --> 23:15.000]  than that it's been two trillion it's been a hundred billion a year for 18
[23:15.000 --> 23:20.440]  years so approaching two trillion and then we don't even get any of the rarest
[23:20.440 --> 23:25.360]  minerals zero and China gets them all we guard the roads and facilities for
[23:25.360 --> 23:29.960]  China to get the rarest minerals to build the smartphones and computers look
[23:29.960 --> 23:33.960]  if we're gonna be imperial we get all of it and I'm not even for that that's
[23:33.960 --> 23:40.200]  a moral but we get it all but see global corporations like Apple and others they
[23:40.200 --> 23:45.880]  are based in China now officially based in Ireland but they're based over there
[23:45.880 --> 23:51.000]  in China pays Europe's attacks and then we go pay for all this so so China and
[23:51.000 --> 23:55.680]  Russia have come out and decried and say the US is meddling in Venezuela let me
[23:55.680 --> 24:00.280]  tell you something it's a national security issue when Venezuela is seven
[24:00.280 --> 24:08.080]  countries from us they're in northeastern South America and they're
[24:08.080 --> 24:13.760]  only what 700 800 miles away from us with a bunch of little bitty countries in
[24:13.760 --> 24:17.520]  between them and they've collapsed Brazil and others all built fences and put
[24:17.520 --> 24:21.280]  their militaries on them the last couple years because it's collapsing and the
[24:21.280 --> 24:26.760]  very worst of Venezuela are coming into their nations but don't worry now it's
[24:26.760 --> 24:30.680]  coming here and you saw the images months ago of the gates being broken down in
[24:30.680 --> 24:36.600]  Guatemala into southern Mexico and now Mexico just said hey you orderly
[24:36.600 --> 24:43.000]  process yourselves we will issue you visas for one month to travel through
[24:43.000 --> 24:46.720]  Mexico and if we catch you after that you'll be sent back or put in prison
[24:46.720 --> 24:50.840]  they're very strict immigration laws obviously in Mexico they should as bad
[24:50.840 --> 24:54.420]  as Mexico is Latin America Central America is even worse now I mean we're
[24:54.420 --> 25:02.000]  talking hellish and so now Mexico is organizing with the UN to flood us just
[25:02.000 --> 25:08.200]  like Turkey did in the last six years and just like Albania did to flood Europe
[25:08.200 --> 25:14.360]  so it is it is diabolical to say the least it is coordinated it is extremely
[25:14.360 --> 25:21.560]  evil and it's only getting worse so I hope that Maduro is thrown out I hope
[25:21.560 --> 25:27.200]  that a popular conservative nationalist gets in Venezuela per capita for a
[25:27.200 --> 25:37.680]  country their size has more resources than any country in the world oil coal
[25:37.680 --> 25:46.640]  diamonds gold silver timber volcanic farmland and in the past hard-working
[25:46.640 --> 25:51.360]  good people but they got on the dole they got into socialism they got told
[25:51.360 --> 25:56.120]  oh that rich coffee plantation owner or that banana plantation owner you could
[25:56.120 --> 26:01.120]  have that you could have that and then they vote to take it and then there's
[26:01.120 --> 26:05.800]  nothing left because the communist leaders don't sit there and shut it on
[26:05.800 --> 26:10.280]  the open market they sell it at reduced prices to multinationals and that's
[26:10.280 --> 26:13.440]  what the globalists love communist and socialist countries because they
[26:13.440 --> 26:19.040]  collapse pristine prosperity and capitalism creates a lot of money
[26:19.040 --> 26:25.080]  people start having five six kids and the kids go to a social school they vote
[26:25.080 --> 26:31.720]  in Hugo Chavez and 15 years later the country is one of the poorest in the
[26:31.720 --> 26:36.480]  world it was the richest country in Latin America richer than the United
[26:36.480 --> 26:43.200]  States the average citizen in 1950 was paid more had more savings and owned
[26:43.200 --> 26:52.200]  more land than the average American in 1950 and now it is a total hellhole
[26:52.200 --> 26:56.000]  that's the story of socialism so remember that when you see Alexandria
[26:56.000 --> 27:00.280]  Cortez bumbling around like a methhead moron whatever the hell she's on
[27:00.280 --> 27:04.720]  remember that that she's sitting there telling a bunch of stupid people hey
[27:04.720 --> 27:07.600]  you're gonna get all this free stuff and the big bankers are funding that because
[27:07.600 --> 27:12.320]  they're gonna sit offshore when America gets totally looted also coming up
[27:12.320 --> 27:15.680]  World War three cometh Syria is threatening to bomb the airport in

[32:00.040 --> 32:03.600]  globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the
[32:03.600 --> 32:07.160]  environment full of the bad halogens fluoride chlorine bromide you name it
[32:07.160 --> 32:13.040]  that it lowers IQ it literally dumps the population down and on our quest to
[32:13.040 --> 32:17.360]  bring our listeners and viewers the best idea in the world we've gone through two
[32:17.360 --> 32:22.280]  permutations first seaweed based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source
[32:22.280 --> 32:25.880]  and the globalist tried to block us getting a supply of it so we discovered
[32:25.880 --> 32:30.240]  deep earth crystals a pure nascent iodine and brought you x2 that's been
[32:30.240 --> 32:34.680]  incredible now due to the establishment trying to block that we did more research
[32:34.680 --> 32:39.800]  and secured more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine but chemists
[32:39.800 --> 32:43.320]  scientists and others showed us the research that by combining it with three
[32:43.320 --> 32:49.160]  other compounds two forms of iodine and vitamin C it supercharges it and makes
[32:49.160 --> 32:54.280]  it even more bio available ladies and gentlemen you want to research it you

[35:06.040 --> 35:11.200]  so-called native american elder and the black israelites but the reason this is
[35:11.200 --> 35:17.040]  so important is even after the lawyer that step 4 representing some of these
[35:17.040 --> 35:22.400]  great young men warned people to back off and gave him a chance to stop the
[35:22.400 --> 35:27.600]  defamation I looked this morning for like an hour and I was fascinated they're
[35:27.600 --> 35:32.600]  still publishing editorials about the hate and how the boys represent that
[35:32.600 --> 35:37.440]  because their hats and how they're nazis and hollywood bully viciously attacks
[35:37.440 --> 35:43.400]  covington students in profanity pedophilia laced rant and that horrible
[35:43.400 --> 35:47.000]  creatures michael rapaport that's a lot about me as well and then meanwhile this
[35:47.000 --> 35:52.040]  guy still has it up on his twitter a well-known musician verified leftist
[35:52.040 --> 35:56.480]  calls for make america great again kids to be fired on school to be burned down
[35:56.480 --> 36:02.160]  tathi griffin said doxxam go get them and they did and culture asked the
[36:02.160 --> 36:05.920]  question journalists in 2018 said alex jones caused the families of sandy
[36:05.920 --> 36:10.000]  hook victims to be harassed never did he must be banned from all social media
[36:10.000 --> 36:14.680]  journalists 2019 please kill these children and their families we got and
[36:14.680 --> 36:18.240]  coming on very soon so again the left always accuses me of saying doing things
[36:18.240 --> 36:22.960]  I didn't do and then they say that I'm currently sending people like a wolf at
[36:22.960 --> 36:29.320]  the door trying to hurt people that's not true but then they do it as a matter
[36:29.320 --> 36:33.400]  of course on twitter and facebook and everywhere else we all know about that
[36:33.400 --> 36:37.080]  maxine water sand if they're at the gas station they're at the mall they're at
[36:37.080 --> 36:39.640]  the grocery store you run their ass out of there and you know what I've
[36:39.640 --> 36:44.600]  experienced it they'll walk over dump hot coffee on your head they'll knock your
[36:44.600 --> 36:48.320]  iced tea over right in front of your kids they don't care meanwhile new york times
[36:48.320 --> 36:54.320]  runs defense for black anti-semite hate group the very group saying they'd
[36:54.320 --> 36:57.920]  harvest the organs of these kids so this is really captured by his
[36:57.920 --> 37:02.760]  imagination because you've still got the new islamic member of a congress days
[37:02.760 --> 37:08.680]  after this is proven to be a hoax ihan omar saying that they were nazis and
[37:08.680 --> 37:12.560]  all this other lies turns out that nathan philips isn't even bigger for all
[37:12.560 --> 37:15.920]  of us never in vietnam never in combat well surprise surprise he's a

[39:59.520 --> 40:03.840]  half-assed removed stuff others have doubled down others have left it up and
[40:03.840 --> 40:09.560]  so we appreciate him joining us at barns underscore law barns law llp.com
[40:09.560 --> 40:13.200]  counselor thanks for joining us and thanks for standing up to real bullies
[40:13.200 --> 40:17.640]  glad to be here I mean it's a it's extraordinary what's taking place I
[40:17.640 --> 40:22.160]  represented people across the political spectrum from Joe Bannister and verney
[40:22.160 --> 40:26.480]  kuglen to Wesley Snipes and Ralph Nader but this may end up being one of the
[40:26.480 --> 40:30.600]  most consequential cases I'm ever a part of because this is about the rights of
[40:30.600 --> 40:35.240]  ordinary people private citizens in this case kids being able to protect their
[40:35.240 --> 40:39.360]  privacy being able to protect their rights who almost had their reputations
[40:39.360 --> 40:43.840]  permanently ruined their their careers and their potential aspirations
[40:43.840 --> 40:48.600]  permanently tarnished solely because of a lie and a libel spread by the
[40:48.600 --> 40:53.120]  establishment press based on kids they had never met a story that they didn't
[40:53.120 --> 40:58.120]  personally witness built on a fabricated stories by lefty protesters who
[40:58.120 --> 41:02.280]  spread it through bots on the internet so it's an extraordinary case and the
[41:02.280 --> 41:05.760]  reason why I offered my services for free is because typically as you know
[41:05.760 --> 41:09.880]  Alex a libel cases can be very expensive very difficult to defend very
[41:09.880 --> 41:14.760]  difficult to bring and normally big powerful establishment press people get
[41:14.760 --> 41:18.400]  away with it all the time so because they know the ordinary person has no
[41:18.400 --> 41:21.440]  remedy they know they sue people like you it makes it very difficult for you
[41:21.440 --> 41:25.840]  to defend yourself so it's what it's a tool they use it's a form of lawfare and
[41:25.840 --> 41:30.560]  I offered my services for free because I wanted to equalize the equation because
[41:30.560 --> 41:34.160]  everybody deserves the same rights to be respected and their rights were not
[41:34.160 --> 41:37.720]  respected in this case by the way a bunch of stuff just clicked you know I'm
[41:37.720 --> 41:40.120]  involved in a bunch of things they're trying to end the first amendment
[41:40.120 --> 41:43.160]  literally using me they admit that I know you were Wesley Snipes lawyer I know
[41:43.160 --> 41:45.840]  you're and I even thought about trying to get a hold of you and they didn't do
[41:45.840 --> 41:49.080]  it so maybe this is meant to happen too for us to talk about some other things
[41:49.080 --> 41:52.440]  because I was I was actually thinking you in mind for the sigh up and trying to
[41:52.440 --> 41:55.720]  run it against me because you're so articulate to break it down but but I
[41:55.720 --> 41:59.280]  think you're saying this is the moment they bit off more than they could chew
[41:59.280 --> 42:03.920]  they really did because these are private kids these are private citizens so
[42:03.920 --> 42:07.320]  not only do they spread something that was a clear lie that was an easy to prove
[42:07.320 --> 42:12.280]  lie they did it in such a way that everybody was outraged that everybody
[42:12.280 --> 42:15.920]  found just incredible and they went they took it a step further I mean they
[42:15.920 --> 42:19.720]  were threatening to burn down the school my law offices within three hours of me
[42:19.720 --> 42:22.920]  announcing that I was representing them was subject to bomb threats that are
[42:22.920 --> 42:26.680]  now currently under FBI investigation they tried to hack every social media
[42:26.680 --> 42:30.600]  account that I had they they've gone after the family the diocese has had to
[42:30.600 --> 42:34.360]  close down three different times because of suspicious packages that showed up
[42:34.360 --> 42:38.400]  at their doors you have lunatics like Michael Rappaport like Ron Perlman
[42:38.400 --> 42:42.760]  making absurd threats now I'll give a congresswoman Omar and Kathy Griffin
[42:42.760 --> 42:46.840]  credit that at least when they libeled them and lied about these kids and I
[42:46.840 --> 42:51.160]  sent tweets to them saying retract or be sued they at least have the proper
[42:51.160 --> 42:54.440]  action of at least retract stay there let's talk about this this is amazing

[47:29.560 --> 47:37.240]  You can listen to the engine mowing out is one old song. You can think about the
[47:37.240 --> 47:50.000]  woman or the girl you knew the night before. Think about it. We've got a
[47:50.000 --> 47:57.400]  clear-cut example here of corporate media seeing a bunch of school kids some
[47:57.400 --> 48:01.080]  of them were make America a great again hatch we're there for a pro-life March
[48:01.080 --> 48:05.840]  and within 30 minutes we went and found the raw footage from the guy's channel
[48:05.840 --> 48:09.640]  going F.U. white people to little black kids who are part of the school F.U.
[48:09.640 --> 48:13.520]  are gonna harvest your organs kid you're gonna die your mother and your
[48:13.520 --> 48:19.720]  father or brother and sisters you're gonna shoot your school up and then
[48:19.720 --> 48:24.200]  the media takes that edits it and the very same groups have done that to me in
[48:24.200 --> 48:28.280]  DC as well they've done the same stuff to us but they come over to y'all and
[48:28.280 --> 48:30.880]  scream at you and then they sit back and go why are you doing this to me because
[48:30.880 --> 48:36.120]  they're editing the tapes so you have the premeditatedness of this and I said
[48:36.120 --> 48:40.880]  day one I said I bet this individual this so-called native elder have it's
[48:40.880 --> 48:44.240]  got a long history of democratic party provocaturing parents out he's been
[48:44.240 --> 48:47.600]  doing it for a decade that same day went to Catholic Church with 20 people at
[48:47.600 --> 48:53.240]  mass beating drums trying to get his ass kicked he goes to colleges on Halloween
[48:53.240 --> 48:56.440]  this is on record in local news channels all the country he's done in
[48:56.440 --> 49:00.960]  Colorado he's done it in in in Michigan he does it all over and he shows up
[49:00.960 --> 49:04.440]  beating a drum getting in people's faces saying you can't dress like an
[49:04.440 --> 49:08.960]  Native American trying to get his butt kicked but no one's ever taken the bait
[49:08.960 --> 49:14.080]  but you know what he's never given up Robert Barnes is again one of the top
[49:14.080 --> 49:18.320]  lawyers in the country when it comes to this he's taking it pro bono he's
[49:18.320 --> 49:21.760]  represented you know major Hollywood stars and cases where they spent millions
[49:21.760 --> 49:24.600]  of fitting themselves some cases winning some cases losing everybody knows
[49:24.600 --> 49:28.200]  about the Wesley Snipes case but the point is he's taking this pro bono
[49:28.200 --> 49:33.240]  because he says it's so clear-cut so lay out what you think really happened
[49:33.240 --> 49:37.800]  here where it's going the 48 hours you've given them again some groups are
[49:37.800 --> 49:42.040]  backing off but then republishing new lies like the New York Times has done so
[49:42.040 --> 49:46.760]  who do you think who are you zeroing in on or I guess that's kind of inside
[49:46.760 --> 49:52.040]  baseball I mean definitely raises gonna get sued the one who said that the
[49:52.040 --> 49:57.560]  that the kids should be punched in the face the former CNN commentator who now
[49:57.560 --> 50:02.400]  has a big social media platform Maggie Haberman has yet to correct her
[50:02.400 --> 50:06.200]  statements where she basically called for the expulsion of these kids and here
[50:06.200 --> 50:09.760]  you have the lead reporter for the lead newspaper in the nation making a false
[50:09.760 --> 50:13.920]  report about kids you never met in a story she didn't witness for facts you
[50:13.920 --> 50:18.200]  didn't have no first hand first hand which your own newspaper has corrected
[50:18.200 --> 50:21.760]  and yet she has refused to delete or correct her own statements in this
[50:21.760 --> 50:27.200]  regard and then Michael Rappapour and Ron Perlman on the on the Hollywood side
[50:27.200 --> 50:31.040]  of the equation and then a range of editors including the editor of Mother
[50:31.040 --> 50:34.600]  Jones who has issued false statements about this was completely disgraced the
[50:34.600 --> 50:38.040]  independent investigative history of that publication with her partisan
[50:38.040 --> 50:42.320]  political nonsense over the past year and a half acting is basically a speaking
[50:42.320 --> 50:46.720]  platform for fusion GPS and the Russia Gates scandal so you have a range of
[50:46.720 --> 50:50.440]  people and there's about about a half dozen other prominent people either in
[50:50.440 --> 50:53.800]  the journalistic world the celebrity world of the social media world who have
[50:53.800 --> 50:57.560]  continued to lie about these kids libel these kids and I think they don't
[50:57.560 --> 51:02.000]  understand Kentucky law Kentucky law says that you can't put kids or any
[51:02.000 --> 51:06.960]  other individual citizen of Kentucky in an unflattering unreasonable light you
[51:06.960 --> 51:10.680]  can't that's called false invasion that's called basically invasion of
[51:10.680 --> 51:14.880]  privacy claim and it's broader than defamation claims broader than libel
[51:14.880 --> 51:18.840]  claims and you can even seek per se damages which means all you have to do
[51:18.840 --> 51:23.560]  is show that the lie was so outrageous of these private citizens that they are
[51:23.560 --> 51:27.280]  entitled to damages without having to prove individual damage I'm not a lawyer
[51:27.280 --> 51:31.560]  but I mean this is really a conspiracy almost like racketeering where all these
[51:31.560 --> 51:35.000]  media groups get together they know it's a lie they all put it out then when they
[51:35.000 --> 51:38.440]  get caught they kind of halfway back off it's okay well where the kids right to
[51:38.440 --> 51:44.600]  confront him and then then they say okay we were wrong but oh you know the kids
[51:44.600 --> 51:49.080]  still ask for it I mean it's just crazy that that that people like Michael
[51:49.080 --> 51:52.640]  Rappaport are not backing down he's still got his video up he's still making
[51:52.640 --> 51:57.400]  jokes I don't think he gets it no I agree I think he's completely out of touch
[51:57.400 --> 52:00.680]  and I think what it is is they're so accustomed to beating up on people they
[52:00.680 --> 52:04.480]  used to attacking public figures of a different kind they're used to doing it
[52:04.480 --> 52:07.960]  in such a way that that they're never sued they're never successfully sued they
[52:07.960 --> 52:11.360]  suffer no consequence the Wall Street Journal even had an editorial on this
[52:11.360 --> 52:14.200]  that said all these people that lied about these kids will probably face no
[52:14.200 --> 52:17.440]  consequence and that was the reason why we try to step into the breach year
[52:17.440 --> 52:20.720]  because these people need to suffer a consequence they need to realize that
[52:20.720 --> 52:25.120]  just because they have the power of the press and the privilege of the press they
[52:25.120 --> 52:29.680]  do not have immunity when they lie about innocent kids who they don't know
[52:29.680 --> 52:32.760]  whose incidents they didn't witness for which they had no evidence to support
[52:32.760 --> 52:36.520]  their false claims for which they knew were false claims within a day of their
[52:36.520 --> 52:39.880]  reporting when they refused to retract the family is a very you know
[52:39.880 --> 52:45.600]  conservative Catholic families and they authorized me to offer a 48-hour notice
[52:45.600 --> 52:48.920]  to everybody that as long as they corrected retracted or deleted their
[52:48.920 --> 52:52.320]  wrongful statements that they wouldn't sue those people they're not looking to
[52:52.320 --> 52:54.880]  sue they don't want to sue they don't want to jump into court they're not
[52:54.880 --> 52:58.880]  litigious people they just don't want this to happen to any other kids like
[52:58.880 --> 53:03.040]  the hell they've been through over the last week and and so thus everybody's
[53:03.040 --> 53:07.200]  on notice that it's they have until the end of business midnight Friday to be
[53:07.200 --> 53:10.240]  able to to retract their statements and if they don't they don't correct they
[53:10.240 --> 53:13.880]  don't apologize they don't remedy they're gonna be sued and they're gonna be
[53:13.880 --> 53:18.040]  sued on an individual basis so they it's not there won't be targeting
[53:18.040 --> 53:21.640]  institutions as much as individuals because that will educate them I think
[53:21.640 --> 53:25.560]  a little bit better that just because you have a powerful institution behind
[53:25.560 --> 53:29.760]  you that doesn't give you immunity to go out there and lie about kids libel kids
[53:29.760 --> 53:33.600]  and bade their privacy try to ruin their reputations try to get them expelled
[53:33.600 --> 53:37.880]  try to deny their admissions to college to try to encourage and incentivize
[53:37.880 --> 53:41.280]  violence against them just because you don't like the hat they wear the color
[53:41.280 --> 53:45.240]  of their skin or their gender can I add one more point counselor I know you're
[53:45.240 --> 53:50.240]  the expert on this but they also have to because the major media is stolen their
[53:50.240 --> 53:54.040]  identity I mean as I said I typed in their names this morning I just typed
[53:54.040 --> 53:59.440]  in Covington Covington students and I saw North Carolina Colorado California
[53:59.440 --> 54:03.960]  op-eds that were out today shang the Covington kids this is just with one
[54:03.960 --> 54:08.160]  search term there was literally dozens which is Covington kids they you know
[54:08.160 --> 54:12.480]  they show the dark side of racism of Kentucky there are articles in Kentucky
[54:12.480 --> 54:16.440]  about the shame of Kentucky and our racism and then showing pictures of
[54:16.440 --> 54:21.760]  these poor kids they're still doing it and then thin paragraphs down they would
[54:21.760 --> 54:25.080]  mention well there's some contention about what happened but it's still the
[54:25.080 --> 54:29.080]  racism of these evil white kids confronting this poor Native American so
[54:29.080 --> 54:32.840]  they're still doing it and that's why I think they have to sue that's why I'm
[54:32.840 --> 54:36.160]  gearing up to countersue other people that are lying about what I've said you
[54:36.160 --> 54:39.640]  know they sue me they lie about what I've said and then they so it's a very
[54:39.640 --> 54:43.560]  complex issue but with this it's so cut and dry so I'm trying to quantify that
[54:43.560 --> 54:47.800]  don't they have to sue to make sure people don't double back and keep lying
[54:47.800 --> 54:51.840]  absolutely I mean the way that the approach to the family was anybody could
[54:51.840 --> 54:56.080]  get redemption through confession if they retracted their full statements but
[54:56.080 --> 55:00.040]  if they double down as you noted many have then those people need punishment
[55:00.040 --> 55:03.960]  and need deterrence through punishment and that needs to be lawfare and for the
[55:03.960 --> 55:07.800]  last decade or so in particularly the last several years lawfare has been
[55:07.800 --> 55:11.960]  waged solely by the left against everybody else to try to censor and
[55:11.960 --> 55:16.200]  shame dissident opinions and dissident powerful voices like yourself and it's
[55:16.200 --> 55:20.440]  time that we fight back on those same terms and fight back using lawfare on
[55:20.440 --> 55:23.920]  behalf of the independent ordinary everyday people and independent
[55:23.920 --> 55:27.880]  journalists and independent voices out there so this can't happen to ordinary
[55:27.880 --> 55:31.280]  people because that was the message here the message was here was if we could
[55:31.280 --> 55:36.400]  destroy the lives of some 16-year-old kids in Covington Kentucky guess what we
[55:36.400 --> 55:40.040]  could do to you and that's why the message needs to be if you think you can
[55:40.040 --> 55:43.040]  lie and libel about them because you happen to write for the New York Times
[55:43.040 --> 55:46.680]  we'll guess again because you're gonna hear from a Kentucky jury about how
[55:46.680 --> 55:51.040]  that should work well it's about to say it sounds to me like they've been using
[55:51.040 --> 55:55.360]  lawfare in a bunch of fake cases they use the publication of these suits we're
[55:55.360 --> 55:59.040]  almost all of it's something I never did no one ever did but they just use that
[55:59.040 --> 56:02.560]  like well it must be true it's in a lawsuit but now we've got the whole
[56:02.560 --> 56:07.640]  bona fides of the setup the frame up the media knew they doubled down I mean it
[56:07.640 --> 56:12.280]  just seems like like you said open and shut because what they say nationalists
[56:12.280 --> 56:15.840]  and Christians and conservatives and libertarians are doing is what the left
[56:15.840 --> 56:18.640]  everybody knows the left for the bullies everybody knows they're the ones
[56:18.640 --> 56:22.880]  brigading around the internet bullying everybody and so now they've they've
[56:22.880 --> 56:26.160]  set it up where you know even questioning something supposedly
[56:26.160 --> 56:30.520]  unlawful or uncivil well now they've done the very definition of what they've
[56:30.520 --> 56:35.320]  projected on to us that's precisely right I mean they've used the law in
[56:35.320 --> 56:40.920]  illegitimate and illicit ways to wage political warfare using bogus claims and
[56:40.920 --> 56:44.800]  using their unique access to the legal system the fact that the judiciary is
[56:44.800 --> 56:49.320]  overwhelmingly establishment to the left the legal profession as a class is
[56:49.320 --> 56:54.360]  overwhelmingly to the cultural left and pro establishment in general and so it's
[56:54.360 --> 56:58.120]  time to sort of equalize the playing field and the advantage here is actually
[56:58.120 --> 57:03.480]  actual law and the actual facts are on the side of the family on the side of the
[57:03.480 --> 57:07.160]  kids and often they've been on the side of those independent voices throughout
[57:07.160 --> 57:11.200]  the political right that have now been subject or independent period have that
[57:11.200 --> 57:14.560]  have been subject to these threats I mean I started doing this representation in
[57:14.560 --> 57:19.000]  the ballot access and petition circulator context for voices like Ralph Nader
[57:19.000 --> 57:23.640]  libertarians constitutionalist tea party folks a peace and freedom party
[57:23.640 --> 57:26.480]  everybody across the ideological sure whoever's persecuted you've been doing
[57:26.480 --> 57:30.320]  that for decades exactly so that was where they originally started political
[57:30.320 --> 57:34.200]  warfare and law legal warfare was using ballot access using your ability to
[57:34.200 --> 57:38.600]  access candidacies your ability to circulate petition now they've shifted
[57:38.600 --> 57:42.880]  it to legal warfare to the same people to libel Robert you're on fire Robert

[59:42.520 --> 59:46.200]  will but I give you my commitment if you financially support us info
[59:46.200 --> 01:00:05.560]  warsword.com to give you my absolute total commitment you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:27.760]  well Robert Barnes again is a very famous lawyer he's represented Ralph
[01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:32.720]  Nader he's represented the Green Party the libertarian party to get on ballot
[01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:36.640]  access and then more and more as he was saying earlier he's the representing so
[01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:40.240]  called extreme right wing which just means classic Americans who are being
[01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:44.640]  attacked lied about in organized concerted effort and he just during the break
[01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:48.080]  quantified it better than I could do and I've been for two plus years
[01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:53.120]  experiencing the real power of the media and the Democrats and the neocon
[01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:56.600]  Republicans trying to crush me but we're getting into the kids right now
[01:00:56.600 --> 01:01:00.480]  because I'm a man I can take it we've got supporters these children we come
[01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:04.800]  back when play compilation of the media demonizing and lying about them you've
[01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:07.680]  told them and you've got a cut in dry case here I think I'd give it you know
[01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:11.400]  90% chance you win in any court even a leftist one these are children they did
[01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:15.680]  nothing they were very restrained in how they acted it's a miracle that
[01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:18.720]  something didn't break out with full grown men with giant hickory clubs and
[01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:24.760]  now so many publications have refused to retract and they're doubling down it's
[01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:29.680]  just it just shows institutional arrogance oh absolutely it's people who
[01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:34.080]  are so accustomed to never facing bad consequences it's how in like a lot of
[01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:37.560]  the criminal cases I handle you deal with prosecutors who do bad things or rogue
[01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:41.520]  agents for the IRS or FBI or other people and you discover early on the
[01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:44.600]  reason why they do it is because they've never suffered any consequences for
[01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:47.280]  getting caught because they're usually not even caught and when they are they
[01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:50.560]  don't suffer consequences the press the establishment press has the same
[01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:54.960]  attitude so these are kids I mean it was so shocking to me I mean these are 15
[01:01:54.960 --> 01:02:00.040]  16 17 sometimes 14 year old kids who first interaction they ever had with
[01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:03.880]  lefty protest culture which if you know lefty protest culture you could see this
[01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:07.760]  coming and interpret this video right away but these kids don't these kids
[01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:11.320]  don't know lefty protest culture they don't know they were being open then in
[01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:14.480]  fact like they were doing a haku dance the haku the haka dance which is very
[01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:18.960]  made famous by the rugby players of New Zealand the famous all blacks who do this
[01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:22.840]  really cool haka dance and so right after they did the haka which was part of
[01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:26.080]  their school tears all of a sudden a Native American comes in training the
[01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:29.920]  drum and they're dancing along with him they think he's joining they think he's
[01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:32.960]  participating they have no idea he's there to do something provocative key
[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:39.000]  they're so innocent and there's so much joy in the media call this hate oh it's
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.480]  which is absurd I mean these are kids who handled it all extraordinarily well I
[01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:47.040]  mean the the black Hebrew Israelites are so called that were mocking them and
[01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:50.400]  attacking them we're also attacking the Native Americans they're using phrases
[01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:55.040]  like Uncle Tomahawk they were the ones who let's just say different sex these
[01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:58.560]  guys are different but some of these black Israel like ribs are basically
[01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:03.240]  black Nazis oh completely they're racial supremacists who their favorite thing
[01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:07.440]  to do is to sit around and just attack people randomly even you know Jonathan
[01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:11.040]  Capehart for the Washington Post said that he avoided him because if he was
[01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:14.560]  walking down the street with his white boyfriend he would be attacked by them so
[01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:18.280]  the whole media knew what the backstory was here it was it was these oh that's
[01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:23.360]  key the media knows damn well the black Israelites are basically like the what's
[01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:28.360]  that church that says God hates fags it goes the military things and oh exactly
[01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:33.320]  I I'm blanking on the name of it but it precisely that it goes out there like the
[01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:38.000]  Westboro Baptist Church rolled into white supremacy black supremacy I mean
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:42.240]  they're like cartoon characters oh completely completely down there the
[01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:46.240]  worst version of Lewis Farrakhan on steroids in terms of some of their
[01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:49.520]  racial and religious prejudices and they believe things that are just
[01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:52.960]  literally insane they make the Scientologists look very very normal so
[01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:57.720]  the so the I so once they the press knew they were there then the press knew
[01:03:57.720 --> 01:04:00.480]  that this was a political ambush even they knew these kids were innocent
[01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:04.440]  Maggie Haberman had to know these kids were innocent so the the fact that they
[01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:07.120]  attacked them they knew what they were doing it was a deliberate campaign they
[01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:11.880]  deliberately used bots and other bot accounts so that would be untraceable and
[01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:15.840]  untrackable who the original source of the defamation in libel was on Twitter and
[01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:20.560]  social when he knows the pre-meditation they're precisely this was as you said a
[01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:25.560]  conspiracy and I think as we dig into the case as we dig into the evidence we'll
[01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:29.760]  find that there's a broader bigger conspiracy here probably of big fine
[01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:34.040]  financiers behind various political groups who are propagating this story as

[01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:32.160]  it isn't true and a lot of the media is retracting with them coming back with
[01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:36.920]  new lies or they were not retracting this removing stories or even worse
[01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:42.040]  they're doubling down and earlier he listed who he plans to go after and then
[01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:47.240]  they need to make a proper complete a retraction as well but but here's just a
[01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:52.560]  small compilation of what they said Saturday Sunday and Monday viciously
[01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:57.000]  against school children here it is now to the outrage over a video showing an
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:02.000]  encounter between teenagers and a Native American veteran near the Lincoln

[01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:23.440]  outrage outrage outrage outrage outrage from all corners here's the video
[01:08:23.440 --> 01:08:27.680]  sparking outrage on social media sparked outrage on social media a group of
[01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:32.120]  teenagers many wearing make America great again hats were caught on video
[01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:36.080]  taunting a Native American Vietnam veteran we are hearing from a Native
[01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:40.040]  American elder in Vietnam War veterans speaking to CNN after a disturbing
[01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:44.360]  viral video shows a group of teens harassing and mocking him in the
[01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:48.920]  nation's capital a disturbing viral video shows a mob of teens and make
[01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:54.120]  America great again hats harassing a Native American elder in Washington then
[01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:58.640]  Phillips describes the tense moments now being replayed over and over again
[01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:04.400]  online when a young man got right in his face watch Nathan Phillips was beating
[01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:09.160]  his drum and singing an American Indian protest song when I was there and I
[01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:12.440]  was standing there and I see that group of people in front of me and I seen the
[01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:18.880]  angry faces and and all of that I realized I had put myself in a really
[01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:23.560]  dangerous situation one young man is captured in a tense moment now being
[01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:28.480]  replayed online getting right in his face and mocking his singing and drumming
[01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:32.680]  on the day of the indigenous people's March a moment from the March has gone
[01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:36.480]  viral and interaction between native marchers and a group of high school
[01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:41.440]  students videos of the encounter shared widely on social media Swiss backlash
[01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:44.920]  against the behavior of those Kentucky teens you see a lot of red in this you
[01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:48.640]  see a lot of the MAGA hats the smile on his face shows how little respect he had
[01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:52.160]  for what he was witness clearly these boys are not getting a good education
[01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:56.760]  because it makes little sense to angrily chant build the wall to a
[01:09:56.760 --> 01:10:01.880]  population with literally zero illegal immigrants who were here long before we
[01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:07.160]  were Hollywood film producer Jack Morrissey tweeted that he wanted the
[01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:16.240]  boys killed I got kids screaming I know this will come as a huge shock to all
[01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:20.600]  of you this entire change was completely misrepresented in the media
[01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:23.480]  left the media of course claim that these suits were harassing this Native
[01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:27.600]  American Indian turns out it was exactly the opposite here's what the mainstream
[01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:32.040]  media refused to tell you happened before the exchange look on these dusty
[01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:37.040]  ass cracks with that racist garbage on look at these dirty ass crack ain't gonna
[01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:41.800]  be no peace until bloody shake I get a little angry looking at this guy who's
[01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:45.480]  gone on CNN everywhere else and what a big victim he is when they're with a
[01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:50.440]  group screaming we're gonna kill you so the media run a completely fake new
[01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:54.960]  story which resulted in children being threatened with murder today the Catholic
[01:10:54.960 --> 01:10:58.280]  school at the center of that viral confrontational Capitol Hill forced
[01:10:58.280 --> 01:11:02.520]  to close students now facing death threats being smeared let's fade this
[01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:09.880]  down there is three minutes left of this context matters compilation video
[01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:14.480]  exposes MSM hoax not a strong enough headline I should a great crew put that
[01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:20.840]  together but what do you call this must see video see MSM frame innocent
[01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:24.480]  students mark them for death I mean what do you call that Robert Barnes the
[01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:29.080]  lawyer pro bono valiantly taking on this massive case hopefully heading back
[01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:32.040]  the future to fundraise for this because I know just suing one person costs
[01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:36.720]  hundreds of thousands of dollars but this is amazing what would you call
[01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:39.880]  what they've done to these these these these poor students
[01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:43.920]  well really it was a hit job it was a hit job on their futures a hit job on
[01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:47.880]  their reputations and ended up being almost a literal hit job with bomb
[01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:51.680]  threats death threats and personal threats of physical violence against them
[01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:56.160]  I mean it's imagine being a 15 16 year old kid you've never experienced this
[01:11:56.160 --> 01:12:01.160]  lefty protest culture before this crazy mob mania mentality on social media on
[01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:05.120]  the left before yet you probably believe in the press relatively speaking you
[01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:09.120]  don't know them to be frauds and and liars and libelers like they are and you
[01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:12.440]  just go up for one day in Washington DC probably the only time you've ever been
[01:12:12.440 --> 01:12:15.560]  there you go up there and you want to and you're with a bunch of fellow
[01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:19.840]  students standing up for the most vulnerable life in the world in a pro
[01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:23.120]  life march and you're just sitting outside a Lincoln Memorial this this
[01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:26.640]  testament to civil rights and civil liberties and you think you're just
[01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:29.520]  participating all of a sudden people are harassing you because of the color of
[01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:32.520]  your skin people are harassing you because of your gender people are
[01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:36.320]  harassing you because of your politics or the hat on your head and all you do
[01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:39.440]  is you don't resort by attacking them you don't even say anything to them
[01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:43.400]  instead what do you do you do your own school cheers and in the process of that
[01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:46.880]  you're doing your haka dance which is a tribute one of the greatest tribal
[01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:51.160]  traditions in the world today you see some tribal members join you and you
[01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:54.680]  think everything is cool everything is fun and then you go home and within an
[01:12:54.680 --> 01:12:57.840]  hour or two all of a sudden you're discovering that you're the subject of
[01:12:57.840 --> 01:13:02.240]  the worst libel campaign of private citizens in American legal political
[01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:06.680]  history and that your lives are at risk your futures are at risk your your
[01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:10.640]  reputations are at risk your own school turns your back on you and initially
[01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:13.800]  some of the so-called conservatives in the press turn their back on you
[01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:18.240]  initially because they buy the liberal lies and the liberal libels and and
[01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:22.320]  that's what happened this was a conspiracy of a hit job against a bunch
[01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:25.800]  of innocent kids to ruin their future and most importantly it wasn't just for
[01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:30.440]  them it was meant to terrorize everybody else out there if you don't it's late
[01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:34.040]  it's the way the reason why iris brings criminal prosecutions and tax cases it's
[01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:38.280]  rarely about the individual it's to scare and terrorize everybody else that if
[01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:41.280]  you don't do what we tell you to do you don't think the way we want you to think
[01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:44.720]  you don't act the way we want you to act if you have the wrong race the wrong
[01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:48.680]  gender the wrong color and ironically this was on MLK weekend that they're
[01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:52.080]  judging people based on their color of their skin not the content of their
[01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:55.880]  character and lying and libeling about that content of their character solely
[01:13:55.880 --> 01:13:59.800]  based on their perceptions of their color of their skin then they can do
[01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:04.640]  anything to you at any time that they have all the power and that's why they're
[01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:08.560]  so obsessed with shutting any independent group down hundreds of
[01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:11.840]  thousands of people kicked off Twitter Facebook YouTube because they're scared
[01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:14.960]  they want to go rig these things stage these things I've experienced it myself
[01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:19.640]  the very same group doing it and they don't you be able to respond they want
[01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:23.480]  to put the hoax out but the good news is no matter what they do the hoax is now
[01:14:23.480 --> 01:14:27.640]  exposed and now that people who are just lay folks like you said earlier are
[01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:31.480]  learning about Democratic Party protest politics where they always try to start a
[01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:35.600]  fight and then edit the video they always try to deceive they use theater and
[01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:40.480]  deception now this did the same thing they had these women march over blow
[01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:45.600]  smoke in my face call me subhumans and my mother's married to her brother call
[01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:50.960]  me a monkey and when I said you're a racist she go I'm just a veteran why are
[01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:55.960]  you in my face and I'm smart but not that smart it wasn't till it was released
[01:14:55.960 --> 01:14:59.080]  I went oh my god they came and set me up because I've been out there for 30
[01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:05.200]  minutes on the street corner this is what they do and imagine if voices like
[01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:08.960]  yours weren't out there imagine if people like Mike Cernovich wasn't doing what he
[01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:12.160]  was doing on Twitter exposing this quickly if people like Tim Poole an
[01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:15.040]  independent journalist who even though he leans to the left has been studying
[01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:18.400]  this protest culture issue for the last five years and how dangerous and
[01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:21.960]  precarious the conduct of the left is if those people hadn't been out there they
[01:15:21.960 --> 01:15:25.520]  didn't have access to the public if the audience and the didn't have access to
[01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:29.840]  their work and your work these kids the libel and lies against these kids may
[01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:33.280]  have worked the reputations may have been ruined there may have been a story
[01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:37.520]  for 80 years later somebody said look at how what happened to Richard Joule
[01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:41.360]  happened to a bunch of little kids from a school and the left said that the
[01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:45.200]  control corporate left the fascists they said let's terrorize them and teach them
[01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:49.880]  not to wear these hats and Democratic Congressman said van wearing the hat for
[01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:53.640]  under 18 I mean I think of how on America let's do one more segment

[01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:33.680]  here back live robert barnes is a prominent lawyer who's represented
[01:20:33.680 --> 01:20:38.840]  people across the board from joe banister the treasury agent that exposed
[01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:42.800]  the irish setting people up very valiant fellow and they were successful in doing
[01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:47.140]  that he was going to federal prison not once but twice he represented Wesley
[01:20:47.140 --> 01:20:50.400]  snipes he represented basically everybody from the left the right you name it in
[01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:54.120]  fact I knew he was but once I got him back on like this guy's a champion of
[01:20:54.120 --> 01:20:57.040]  liberty my god we should have gotten this guy on years ago we've had some of
[01:20:57.040 --> 01:21:00.640]  his other fellow lawyers from their cases on before but robert barnes
[01:21:00.640 --> 01:21:05.840]  recapping what you've announced your 48 hours and who so far has doubled down
[01:21:05.840 --> 01:21:10.040]  versus who's back down who you are currently planning to sue for this
[01:21:10.040 --> 01:21:14.840]  conspiracy to turn just innocent and well-behaved nice catholic schoolboys
[01:21:14.840 --> 01:21:20.080]  into Hitler and obviously they've got to do this just to defend their their name
[01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:23.480]  and their record for life but this is really a fight for their survival right
[01:21:23.480 --> 01:21:29.600]  now just shows a psychotic nature of the leftist press oh precisely so razer who
[01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:33.640]  was the former CNN producer got fired last year for inflammatory comments but
[01:21:33.640 --> 01:21:37.640]  as a huge social media following and is constantly within the press he called
[01:21:37.640 --> 01:21:42.080]  for these kids to be punched easy you referred to the face of a young Nick as
[01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:46.600]  a what a punchable face he has refused to retract any of his false libels he's
[01:21:46.600 --> 01:21:51.000]  almost a guarantee to be sued next Monday following on that is going to be
[01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:54.280]  Maggie Maggie Haberman if she doesn't retract her false statements calling for
[01:21:54.280 --> 01:21:59.880]  the kids to be expelled after that Michael Rappaport who's on a TV show on
[01:21:59.880 --> 01:22:06.280]  Netflix for against bullying of kids and here he is a bullying kids with
[01:22:06.280 --> 01:22:10.320]  homophobic rhetoric he's gonna get sued next week unless he corrects act takes
[01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:13.640]  corrective action and then there's a range of other journalists celebrities and
[01:22:13.640 --> 01:22:17.440]  social media personalities that we've specifically called out and said they
[01:22:17.440 --> 01:22:20.640]  need to retract they need to correct they need to delete their offending tweet
[01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:25.000]  and if they are their offending comments or retract their offending story and if
[01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:29.040]  they do they do within 48 hours if they do by week send if they do by Friday
[01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:33.600]  at midnight they won't be sued anyone who refuses to or doubles down chances are
[01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:37.080]  they will be sued and chances are they'll be seeing a Kentucky jury within
[01:22:37.080 --> 01:22:42.200]  the year I would quite a term sneaking around because a bunch of publications
[01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:46.720]  Newsweek the New York Times I mean I read all these have come out and kind of
[01:22:46.720 --> 01:22:52.400]  halfway said okay we were confused was a jump to judgment but oh the black
[01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:55.880]  Israelites really meant well and that's what the Native American went over they
[01:22:55.880 --> 01:22:59.440]  felt threatened that NPR has done it and they're now wheezing around about well
[01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:04.400]  the underlying evil of Kentucky and they are white and if there's a very
[01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:08.600]  sliminess about this that if you don't go after them if the families don't stay
[01:23:08.600 --> 01:23:12.520]  the course they're just gonna go rewrite history as soon as they stop
[01:23:12.520 --> 01:23:16.840]  fighting well one of the people that's likely to get sued next week is the
[01:23:16.840 --> 01:23:20.240]  New York Daily News because I represent some of the kids that were in some of
[01:23:20.240 --> 01:23:24.160]  those photos that were blackouts and blackouts were very popular throughout
[01:23:24.160 --> 01:23:29.400]  all of high school basketball and sports for the last decade where everybody
[01:23:29.400 --> 01:23:32.960]  dresses in all black or they paint themselves in all black and they were
[01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:37.640]  wrongfully identified as being in blackface mocking a black player completely
[01:23:37.640 --> 01:23:41.120]  false completely fabricated the New York Daily News knew that the New York Daily
[01:23:41.120 --> 01:23:44.320]  News has been a hacked newspaper now for about a half decade but if they don't
[01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:47.760]  retract that headline they don't retract that story then they're gonna get sued
[01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:51.440]  and they're gonna face a Kentucky jury like they need to for lying and
[01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:55.440]  libeling about kids there's a whole bunch of corporate media too that keeps
[01:23:55.440 --> 01:24:00.320]  saying they were chanting build that wall and they were flashing Nazi
[01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:04.360]  solutions I mean that is the real defamation right there oh absolutely
[01:24:04.360 --> 01:24:08.400]  they said that they stopped a Indian March didn't happen said they surrounded
[01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:12.600]  the the Native American elder didn't happen they said that they wait that they
[01:24:12.600 --> 01:24:16.160]  went up into his face didn't happen they said they chanted build the wall
[01:24:16.160 --> 01:24:20.440]  didn't happen said they chanted racist slurs didn't happen said that they were
[01:24:20.440 --> 01:24:26.160]  mocking him taunting him using racist references didn't happen didn't happen
[01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:29.840]  didn't happen they were the victim of a lot of those things but they themselves
[01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:33.080]  didn't do any of that they were completely innocent and consistently and
[01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:36.920]  continuously lied about that's why someone like Congresswoman Omar who said
[01:24:36.920 --> 01:24:41.400]  all kinds of crazy stuff within one hour of me asking her to retract her tweeter
[01:24:41.400 --> 01:24:44.880]  she was gonna be sued next week what did she do she completely deleted her
[01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:48.600]  tweet and hasn't defended it since then let's be clear she does all the damage
[01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:52.560]  and then hides it that doesn't do it she has to she has to explain I was wrong
[01:24:52.560 --> 01:24:57.160]  they didn't do this precisely and that they need to learn like congressmen as
[01:24:57.160 --> 01:25:00.760]  think that they are immune from defamation and libel but that's actually
[01:25:00.760 --> 01:25:05.200]  much more limited doctor it is that law or in Congress it's not what they do
[01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:08.720]  outside of that correct I mean if they're answering a press conference about
[01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:12.160]  someone subject to regulation or litigation it's a public figure then it
[01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:15.920]  probably is within that but when it's a private publication when it's a private
[01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:18.600]  statement about a private you're talking about private people that are
[01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:24.240]  children precisely being elected to Congress is not it is not immunity to
[01:25:24.240 --> 01:25:28.440]  suddenly start lying about your neighbor about your ex-wife about your in-law
[01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:32.480]  yeah that's never or your business competitor it's never been that and
[01:25:32.480 --> 01:25:35.600]  that's another theory that will be maybe testing in this case if certain
[01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:39.520]  congressmembers don't issue corrections don't issue apologies don't issue I
[01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:43.920]  think the anatomy of this counselor shows the crazed arrogance though like you
[01:25:43.920 --> 01:25:47.200]  said they've been doing this to public figures so long now they just think
[01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:50.800]  let's do it the kids it really does scare me that they're this reckless
[01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:55.280]  shifting gears is briefly you you had brought up off here you know what's
[01:25:55.280 --> 01:26:00.720]  happening myself and others and just this whole campaign of crazed insanity oh
[01:26:00.720 --> 01:26:05.280]  precisely it's part of a campaign the campaign is to have people have thought
[01:26:05.280 --> 01:26:09.080]  control that the current cultural left in the media left in the corporate media
[01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:13.120]  left thinks very much like sort of the priest during the Inquisition era so
[01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:16.680]  they're not concerned with independence of thought with the irrationality of
[01:26:16.680 --> 01:26:20.480]  thought with the evidentiary empirical truth of thought they're only concerned
[01:26:20.480 --> 01:26:24.600]  with thought control mind control they want to suppress and oppress heresies
[01:26:24.600 --> 01:26:27.800]  they want to witch hunt whomever they can whenever they can wherever they can
[01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:31.520]  and they want to terrify and terrorize the public into cultural conformist
[01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:35.160]  thought and behavior and the greatest threat to that has been independent
[01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:38.840]  voices who give voice to independent people who can reach large numbers of
[01:26:38.840 --> 01:26:42.520]  people like yourself that's why there's been this collusion between the big tech
[01:26:42.520 --> 01:26:47.120]  social media giants and the big media press into suppressing and oppressing
[01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:50.280]  your voice because they need to make sure that ordinary people like these
[01:26:50.280 --> 01:26:54.160]  Covington kids don't have a defense that they don't have lawyers like me
[01:26:54.160 --> 01:26:57.480]  defending them in court because I don't even know the case exists because I
[01:26:57.480 --> 01:27:00.160]  don't even know the circumstances happened because I don't have access to
[01:27:00.160 --> 01:27:03.440]  people like yourself who tell me what actually happened and what's true and
[01:27:03.440 --> 01:27:07.560]  that's what is part of a broader goal and a broader objective to suppress
[01:27:07.560 --> 01:27:12.320]  speech censor of thought control minds control behavior so that you only think
[01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:15.320]  what the cultural elites and the corporate media want you to think rather
[01:27:15.320 --> 01:27:18.440]  than being independent having access to the truth I mean it's like what Thomas
[01:27:18.440 --> 01:27:22.000]  Jefferson said way back the best answer to a bad idea is a good idea in a debate
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:25.800]  if you truly believe the truth and empirical value and moral virtue of your
[01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:29.120]  ideas you're never afraid of the big you're never afraid of a discussion
[01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:33.000]  exactly but they build a strong end of who we are then get us taken off airs
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:39.120]  they can lie about us more in closing I think that if America doesn't mobilize
[01:27:39.120 --> 01:27:42.520]  behind the First Amendment and reverse all this it's going to send into civil
[01:27:42.520 --> 01:27:47.680]  war and I just think like you said they have suspended logic and they have
[01:27:47.680 --> 01:27:50.360]  started to drink their own Kool-Aid and I think what you're doing in this case
[01:27:50.360 --> 01:27:55.320]  and I at a gut level I think this this case really illustrates the whole thing
[01:27:55.320 --> 01:27:59.720]  and it's a sea change absolutely it's a precedent setting case that is a
[01:27:59.720 --> 01:28:04.120]  different exemplar that exposes the media press corporate establishment doing
[01:28:04.120 --> 01:28:07.760]  what they're really up to using social media control to try to censor and
[01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:11.040]  shame dissident speech to try to control thoughts and all that's gonna
[01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:14.160]  ultimately lead to when you engage in that kind of social media repression and
[01:28:14.160 --> 01:28:18.720]  censorship and shaming of innocent individuals in witch-hunting and false
[01:28:18.720 --> 01:28:22.480]  blaming and sin-goating is what people like Tim Poole who's an independent
[01:28:22.480 --> 01:28:25.320]  reporter from the left who's been following protest culture for the last half
[01:28:25.320 --> 01:28:28.840]  decade and he's been predicting a cultural civil war that could turn violent
[01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:32.040]  within several years and it's all because of what the institutional press
[01:28:32.040 --> 01:28:35.600]  and the establishment press is doing where here they grit green lit bully
[01:28:35.600 --> 01:28:39.200]  behavior and violent behavior a bunch against a bunch of innocent quiet kids

[01:33:35.240 --> 01:33:42.960]  I apologize to Gabe Hoffman he's an amazing filmmaker
[01:33:42.960 --> 01:33:50.600]  patriot researcher but I got the lawyer for the school children set up and
[01:33:50.600 --> 01:33:54.960]  demonized for this evil globalist race war to betray the dreams of Martin
[01:33:54.960 --> 01:34:01.840]  Luther King and the abolitionists and others to hell so it was very powerful
[01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:06.640]  interview and I've forgotten how that lawyers represented the Green Party
[01:34:06.640 --> 01:34:12.320]  libertarians Wesley Snipes IRS agents that blew the whistle on corruption then
[01:34:12.320 --> 01:34:16.480]  I clicked once he was on air with me that's why we ended up spending so much
[01:34:16.480 --> 01:34:19.840]  time with him a little bit the next hour with him then Katie Hopkins the
[01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:24.480]  great British broadcaster she'll be joining us as well we'll talk to Gabe
[01:34:24.480 --> 01:34:28.520]  Hoffman I don't even know where to start here with this I mean I've got a huge
[01:34:28.520 --> 01:34:33.640]  research sheet here and a bunch of clips and everything else to understand
[01:34:33.640 --> 01:34:40.200]  Hollywood is all about power and if you sexually control people then you've
[01:34:40.200 --> 01:34:46.000]  got power over them nobody's gonna believe you is the Atlantic reporting on
[01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:51.800]  the Bohemian Rhapsody director Brian Singer and what's coming out about
[01:34:51.800 --> 01:34:56.360]  sexual misconduct including underage people the rest of it and Gabe Hoffman
[01:34:56.360 --> 01:34:58.920]  intimately involved in the whole investigations we'll talk to him here in
[01:34:58.920 --> 01:35:04.640]  just a moment that said ladies and gentlemen I'm not the best person at
[01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:10.240]  getting up here on air like I'm not comparing this this but I've had a lot
[01:35:10.240 --> 01:35:13.720]  of family that had heart problems and then they just die they never tell you
[01:35:13.720 --> 01:35:17.960]  that heart problems or you don't know some uncle or great uncle or somebody
[01:35:17.960 --> 01:35:21.960]  has cancer till oh yeah they died last week of cancer they were like like at
[01:35:21.960 --> 01:35:24.640]  your house two weeks before sitting there having dinner with you and kind of
[01:35:24.640 --> 01:35:28.840]  grunting a little bit but you know so I'm not saying I got cancer I'm dying but
[01:35:28.840 --> 01:35:33.560]  I've got a decision to make here very soon about what I'm gonna tell the
[01:35:33.560 --> 01:35:36.560]  audience because they've been trying to shut us down I don't want to give the
[01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:39.480]  enemy what they want I don't want to you know they obviously know how
[01:35:39.480 --> 01:35:43.760]  successful they've been we still have a huge audience but money-wise they have
[01:35:43.760 --> 01:35:47.800]  really hurt us and we're basically the point where we're not gonna be able to
[01:35:47.800 --> 01:35:51.520]  expand and once you get to the point you're not expanding if you're not
[01:35:51.520 --> 01:35:54.880]  expanding you're you're you're contracting things don't just sit in stasis
[01:35:54.880 --> 01:35:59.800]  in the universe so that's what I've said and that's it and a lot of it's my fault
[01:35:59.800 --> 01:36:03.080]  you know if I cut new ads and I did promos about how great our products are
[01:36:03.080 --> 01:36:05.760]  because we go out produce the best products we go out the very best stuff
[01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:08.960]  that's out there well it's air filtration water filtration non-gmo
[01:36:08.960 --> 01:36:14.800]  heirloom seeds you know healthy CBD oil from raw hemp it's legal in all 50
[01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:18.480]  states I mean whatever we promote it really is the best because I treat you
[01:36:18.480 --> 01:36:25.080]  like I want to be treated but if we don't get massive support on a daily basis
[01:36:25.080 --> 01:36:27.960]  that means spreading the article spreading the videos taking the local
[01:36:27.960 --> 01:36:31.360]  stations and by the price won't be here and look I hate to get on air and talk
[01:36:31.360 --> 01:36:39.360]  like that but let me tell you something I can sell my house that'll fund this
[01:36:39.360 --> 01:36:46.400]  place about two months that's what this kind of comes down to is I don't want
[01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:49.600]  to announce how successful the enemy's been I think people've noticed haven't
[01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:54.280]  you so I never been happier I mean I enjoy fighting the global so I enjoy
[01:36:54.280 --> 01:37:00.040]  taking them on but they see us is that fortress they want to take down and if
[01:37:00.040 --> 01:37:04.000]  they can do it they think they've had victory so a I want to thank all the
[01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000]  listeners that have financially supported us while getting great products
[01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:10.800]  at the same time but be on to people that haven't bought the products get off
[01:37:10.800 --> 01:37:15.680]  the fence now I noticed one of our it's our best-seller total thing that makes
[01:37:15.680 --> 01:37:18.320]  the most money super mill volatility and that we can't get any more because you
[01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:22.160]  can't get the wildcrafts and herbs so that's our last run of that that's 50%
[01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:27.160]  off but we've got brain force that's a good classic
[01:37:27.160 --> 01:37:32.040]  neutropic with healthy natural energy and it's a best-seller because stuff
[01:37:32.040 --> 01:37:36.200]  that's similar is twice the price well this is turbo force that's got all the
[01:37:36.200 --> 01:37:39.640]  amino acids all the vitamins all the minerals and then it's got the 200
[01:37:39.640 --> 01:37:44.040]  milligrams of naturally occurring slow release caffeine and then it's got all
[01:37:44.040 --> 01:37:48.920]  these other things known for clean healthy stimulant all fused together and
[01:37:48.920 --> 01:37:54.440]  I'm here to tell you just like there's 5,000 plus reviews for brain force plus
[01:37:54.440 --> 01:37:59.520]  this will have that many reviews from third-party sites because this sucker is
[01:37:59.520 --> 01:38:04.360]  powerful I recommend you take a half a packet the first time you do it though
[01:38:04.360 --> 01:38:09.080]  because it's so strong and in my experience the rest of those experience
[01:38:09.080 --> 01:38:14.560]  we've had this about six months in beta 10 12 hours of energy and then not having
[01:38:14.560 --> 01:38:18.120]  the hangover because it's all slow burn all right we're gonna go to our guest

[01:39:10.040 --> 01:39:15.960]  the head funds manager philanthropist and owner of a production company that
[01:39:15.960 --> 01:39:20.160]  created the ground breaking documentary film an open secret exposing child sex
[01:39:20.160 --> 01:39:25.080]  abuse in Hollywood he serves as producer and lead public advocate for an open
[01:39:25.080 --> 01:39:29.040]  secret and of course he openly was here I guess a year ago you're an app ago he
[01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:33.280]  can remind me specifically talked about the individuals that are now in
[01:39:33.280 --> 01:39:38.960]  Atlantic monthly the Atlantic in the New York Times in the Washington Post in the
[01:39:38.960 --> 01:39:42.040]  one a guardian son he was intimately involved with the researchers in this
[01:39:42.040 --> 01:39:46.280]  huge 30-page article out of the Atlantic which we commend them finally doing
[01:39:46.280 --> 01:39:49.480]  their job that have gotten into this nobody is going to believe you and
[01:39:49.480 --> 01:39:53.840]  getting into the vehement and rhapsody director Brian Singer so thanks for
[01:39:53.840 --> 01:39:59.960]  joining us in the short segment Gabe just just recap why you got involved the
[01:39:59.960 --> 01:40:06.280]  larger story and how singer is kind of a rabbit hole or is it more than that to
[01:40:06.280 --> 01:40:10.680]  what's happening well thanks Alex it's great to be here with you you know I was
[01:40:10.680 --> 01:40:15.280]  in Austin with you one week after we made our film that Hollywood blocked and
[01:40:15.280 --> 01:40:20.320]  tried to censor we made our film an open secret free on Vimeo our film centered
[01:40:20.320 --> 01:40:25.000]  around Brian Singer and his involvement in Den digital entertainment network
[01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:29.240]  where young boys were basically drugged and raped it was a front for pedophiles
[01:40:29.240 --> 01:40:36.720]  little over one year later January 2019 we're back for more history because
[01:40:36.720 --> 01:40:43.000]  Brian Singer was the number one paid director in Hollywood in 2017 and now
[01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:47.680]  his career is over because of this article which was started with the work
[01:40:47.680 --> 01:40:51.560]  we did that's right you were here a year ago and you centered around him people
[01:40:51.560 --> 01:40:55.080]  can find the interview so it's later off YouTube but I'm sure it's somewhere out
[01:40:55.080 --> 01:40:58.760]  there we should find that interview but you kept going into singer singer and
[01:40:58.760 --> 01:41:03.120]  all these handlers and all these managers I like basically he was well
[01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:08.440]  you should get into yourself because you're the expert right so we can go
[01:41:08.440 --> 01:41:12.160]  through all of it Alex but you know I want to let you know that I'm here to
[01:41:12.160 --> 01:41:16.960]  support you and what you do with info wars I know that you care about children
[01:41:16.960 --> 01:41:21.680]  you care about child sex abuse whether it's sexualizing a 10-year-old drag
[01:41:21.680 --> 01:41:26.040]  boy Desmond is the amazing whether it's calling out the child porn on Netflix
[01:41:26.040 --> 01:41:30.840]  in that show desire whether it's drag tots and the sexualization of children
[01:41:30.840 --> 01:41:35.240]  whether it's the big pedophile bus under President Trump things like you know
[01:41:35.240 --> 01:41:39.600]  Operation Broken Heart 2300 pedophiles rounded up each and every time the
[01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:43.600]  mainstream media ignores it you're the one who cares about children and you're
[01:41:43.600 --> 01:41:47.440]  the one who gets out there on your soapbox and that's why the people need
[01:41:47.440 --> 01:41:53.320]  to support you and what you do to keep that going otherwise that flame will go
[01:41:53.320 --> 01:41:56.880]  out and that's what freaks me out is that there's ten times the number
[01:41:56.880 --> 01:42:00.960]  literally a pedophiles being arrested not just child porn real kids in being
[01:42:00.960 --> 01:42:04.960]  traffic and then and we learn Obama was shipping a man with the open borders and
[01:42:04.960 --> 01:42:09.560]  and and then the mainstream media tries to run hoaxes that pedophilia doesn't
[01:42:09.560 --> 01:42:13.680]  exist even though it's all over the place you're right and you only have to
[01:42:13.680 --> 01:42:16.720]  look at how the mainstream media the liberals are treating the Brian Singer

[01:45:18.920 --> 01:45:21.840]  good but hard to source and the globalists tried to block us getting a
[01:45:21.840 --> 01:45:26.560]  supply of it so we discovered deep earth crystals a pure nascent iodine and
[01:45:26.560 --> 01:45:30.600]  brought you X2 that's been incredible now due to the establishment trying to
[01:45:30.600 --> 01:45:35.040]  block that we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals
[01:45:35.040 --> 01:45:40.000]  of nascent iodine but chemists scientists and others showed us the research that by
[01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:44.760]  combining it with three other compounds two forms of iodine and vitamin C it
[01:45:44.760 --> 01:45:51.160]  supercharges it and makes it even more bio available ladies and gentlemen you

[01:47:23.840 --> 01:47:32.600]  Gabe Hoffman is a documentary filmmaker but he's been one of the top fund
[01:47:32.600 --> 01:47:37.600]  managers out there he's been listed at the conclusion of multiple years as one
[01:47:37.600 --> 01:47:42.160]  of the top 10 performing hedge funds in the Barron's annual lead table he
[01:47:42.160 --> 01:47:45.720]  specialized identifying scientific medical and financial frauds on Wall
[01:47:45.720 --> 01:47:50.080]  Street and that's how he started the story here with us a year ago was where
[01:47:50.080 --> 01:47:53.800]  it was work why he got into it why he risked his life everything as you have
[01:47:53.800 --> 01:47:58.800]  the pedophiles they come after you and now a year later when he was on with us
[01:47:58.800 --> 01:48:03.480]  a year ago you can search you can find it when we were promoting the premiere of
[01:48:03.480 --> 01:48:09.120]  an open secret the film facebook.com forward slash an open secret doc I was
[01:48:09.120 --> 01:48:12.840]  like okay I remember even during the break saying listen we always get soon
[01:48:12.840 --> 01:48:16.200]  we focus in on one person so I understand you've all these witnesses all
[01:48:16.200 --> 01:48:20.720]  these people but I remember now during the break knowing I'm keep talking about
[01:48:20.720 --> 01:48:24.120]  Bob Singer over and over again you're like well that's the key though you know
[01:48:24.120 --> 01:48:29.040]  that's the door into all this stuff and so now here is a 30-page article in the
[01:48:29.040 --> 01:48:33.240]  Atlantic basically detailing the whole thing and he's in deep trouble I know
[01:48:33.240 --> 01:48:37.040]  you've been deeply involved Gabe Hoffman expose this so spend a minute or so on
[01:48:37.040 --> 01:48:40.880]  how you woke up why you got involved and let's get into this huge expose a
[01:48:40.880 --> 01:48:47.320]  report that could really blow the door off this whole weird sick system sure
[01:48:47.320 --> 01:48:52.520]  well Alex you know this got going after our film was released for free on
[01:48:52.520 --> 01:48:58.000]  Vimeo October 2017 I was with you in Austin and after that millions and
[01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:01.720]  millions of you started happening and guess what one of Brian Singer's
[01:49:01.720 --> 01:49:07.160]  victims came to us a brave young man by the name of Brett S and we got this
[01:49:07.160 --> 01:49:11.920]  deadline expose a in the works for December it was published December 8th
[01:49:11.920 --> 01:49:18.960]  2017 well Brian Singer this big Hollywood director he got fired from the set of
[01:49:18.960 --> 01:49:24.640]  Bohemian Rhapsody the big film just a few days earlier why did Brian Singer start
[01:49:24.640 --> 01:49:28.960]  acting erratically and not showing up to work because he knew this expose was in
[01:49:28.960 --> 01:49:33.200]  the works the journalist was checking it with his people and this expose in
[01:49:33.200 --> 01:49:41.760]  December detailed recent crimes 2014-16 of pulling a homeless kid underage off
[01:49:41.760 --> 01:49:47.680]  the street for a group sex session plying under 21 18 barely 18 kids with
[01:49:47.680 --> 01:49:52.880]  drugs and alcohol corruption of a minor so now we're hoping with this big expose
[01:49:52.880 --> 01:49:57.440]  a in the Atlantic that the LA District Attorney's Office will get on this you
[01:49:57.440 --> 01:50:01.840]  have an on-the-record witness to multiple crimes against children that we
[01:50:01.840 --> 01:50:05.440]  exposed these in the Atlantic are a little older they may not be able to go
[01:50:05.440 --> 01:50:10.480]  after them but Brian Singer may face deeper legal trouble and you've also
[01:50:10.480 --> 01:50:15.220]  detailed just dozens of directors producers I mean I see dozens it's
[01:50:15.220 --> 01:50:19.600]  hundreds but prominent ones who get convicted of raping kids and still get
[01:50:19.600 --> 01:50:26.600]  jobs directing movies with little kids and it's just like what why are there
[01:50:26.600 --> 01:50:31.640]  so many people abusing women little girls little boys and what happens
[01:50:31.640 --> 01:50:35.480]  women is terrible I have three daughters and one son so it's all equal to me but
[01:50:35.480 --> 01:50:40.320]  it seems like boys of this particular group like if they had little girls at
[01:50:40.320 --> 01:50:44.680]  gay bars or straight bars dancing half naked in front of men throwing money
[01:50:44.680 --> 01:50:48.240]  then shut the bar down but if it's little boys all over the country now
[01:50:48.240 --> 01:50:52.960]  they're just doing it little boys posing naked in gay magazines or with
[01:50:52.960 --> 01:50:57.240]  with with naked men I mean this is crazy it's like well they're little boys they
[01:50:57.240 --> 01:51:01.880]  can toughen up right or you have publicimposed just calling it you know
[01:51:01.880 --> 01:51:05.680]  sexual misconduct when it's not when it's child rape and child sex abuse and
[01:51:05.680 --> 01:51:10.920]  so what happened after this in December 2017 when we got these recent crimes
[01:51:10.920 --> 01:51:16.080]  exposed but by Brian Singer and he went crazy and and got fired off the set of
[01:51:16.080 --> 01:51:20.800]  Bohemian Rhapsody is a couple journalists they were then part of
[01:51:20.800 --> 01:51:25.800]  Esquire they contacted me it was our first phone call of many in February of
[01:51:25.800 --> 01:51:30.600]  2017 we gave them a lot of leads we introduced them to Brett and others they
[01:51:30.600 --> 01:51:35.200]  got to work and they did truly remarkable work things that we couldn't put
[01:51:35.200 --> 01:51:39.720]  in a film and you know we'll get to it but probably most importantly Brad
[01:51:39.720 --> 01:51:44.800]  Renfrow now Brad Renfrow was a big child star he was in The Client with Joel
[01:51:44.800 --> 01:51:51.000]  Schumacher he was an apt pupil everybody knew Brad Renfrow was sexually abused by
[01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:55.840]  director Brian Singer during the filming of apt pupil but couldn't get anybody on
[01:51:55.840 --> 01:52:00.760]  the record in a film at the time they got people in print and it's just simply
[01:52:00.760 --> 01:52:07.320]  awful Brad Renfrow as many know died of a heroin overdose at age 25
[01:52:07.320 --> 01:52:13.120]  again I remember you telling me this when you first came on a year and a half ago
[01:52:13.120 --> 01:52:17.040]  then a year ago how it got you involved because I just got involved because
[01:52:17.040 --> 01:52:20.120]  every time we turn something over we're looking for pedophilia it seems like
[01:52:20.120 --> 01:52:23.400]  it's the religion of these people whether it's the elites in New York or
[01:52:23.400 --> 01:52:26.960]  the elites out in LA it's like average people aren't like this and then the
[01:52:26.960 --> 01:52:31.520]  recklessness of like you know Sandusky raping kids in the middle of the field
[01:52:31.520 --> 01:52:35.920]  house in the showers in front of people it's it's like the brazenness is
[01:52:35.920 --> 01:52:43.680]  insane and and and salon and vice-promoting pedophilia it's just
[01:52:43.680 --> 01:52:48.760]  it's in it's insane and that's why you know folks have to support you and why
[01:52:48.760 --> 01:52:52.960]  we have to keep fighting the fight and what's kept me fighting the fight I
[01:52:52.960 --> 01:52:57.280]  mean everybody can go and look at blue check Twitter celebrities people like
[01:52:57.280 --> 01:53:01.480]  Sarah Silverman you know Kathy Griffin and others millions and millions of
[01:53:01.480 --> 01:53:07.360]  followers these same celebrities were tweeting you know violence and advocating
[01:53:07.360 --> 01:53:12.440]  doxing and even in one case death against children just because they were
[01:53:12.440 --> 01:53:18.600]  wearing mega hats and look today 24 hours after the big Brian Singer Hollywood
[01:53:18.600 --> 01:53:23.240]  child sex abuse expose and there's crickets from every single one of those
[01:53:23.240 --> 01:53:29.440]  big Hollywood liberals it's it's just sickening and it's shocking bit by bit
[01:53:29.440 --> 01:53:34.400]  piece by piece this is a long war and today with Brian Singer's career ending
[01:53:34.400 --> 01:53:41.440]  this is just another great victory and then you've got Kevin Spacey and I
[01:53:41.440 --> 01:53:45.320]  understand the guy said he was 21 he was 18 but Spacey's humping him in the bar
[01:53:45.320 --> 01:53:48.840]  pulling his genitals out so we obviously know there's always other
[01:53:48.840 --> 01:53:54.120]  witnesses that were even younger it just shows a crazed maniac behavior we're
[01:53:54.120 --> 01:53:58.360]  right and we learned in you know November again shortly after our film came
[01:53:58.360 --> 01:54:04.760]  out it was I think October 31st 2017 was when Anthony Rapp you know famous actor
[01:54:04.760 --> 01:54:08.400]  he came forward and said Kevin Spacey tried to rape him when he was 14
[01:54:08.400 --> 01:54:11.680]  another one of his friends that Kevin Spacey tried to rape him when he was
[01:54:11.680 --> 01:54:17.560]  15 so this last thing is probably one of the most mild instances but I have to
[01:54:17.560 --> 01:54:21.520]  tell you there are hundreds and hundreds of accusations against Kevin Spacey
[01:54:21.520 --> 01:54:27.200]  going back many many years and his good friend of course was Brian Singer that's
[01:54:27.200 --> 01:54:31.240]  right and then what about and of course he also flew Kevin Spacey flew a bunch
[01:54:31.240 --> 01:54:36.560]  of times on the lead express admittedly had like 13 14-year-old girls on it to
[01:54:36.560 --> 01:54:40.240]  the sex and what about our Kelly who won't he goes yeah I like little girls
[01:54:40.240 --> 01:54:44.360]  and then he reportedly pisses on little girls and that's what he likes and then
[01:54:44.360 --> 01:54:49.400]  he doesn't get in trouble I mean he's being protected absolutely and you know
[01:54:49.400 --> 01:54:53.680]  that shows the power of documentaries where we had to go despite having a 94
[01:54:53.680 --> 01:54:57.880]  percent rating on rotten tomatoes from professional film critics even big
[01:54:57.880 --> 01:55:02.560]  liberals like the New York Times and Variety all positive reviews that nobody
[01:55:02.560 --> 01:55:06.600]  would you know even give us a dime for our film at the time guess what five
[01:55:06.600 --> 01:55:12.000]  million views later Brian Singer's career ended we never got sued even once so
[01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:16.440]  now you see things getting a little easier with the big lifetime documentary
[01:55:16.440 --> 01:55:20.440]  actually on our Kelly you know somebody buying the thing and actually getting
[01:55:20.440 --> 01:55:26.440]  made and people can see it on TV the takeaway is Gabe Hoffman is you've been
[01:55:26.440 --> 01:55:31.800]  totally vindicated your film focused on mr. Singer and now he's lost his jobs
[01:55:31.800 --> 01:55:35.560]  he's being fired there's huge Atlantic Monthly Exposes with all these
[01:55:35.560 --> 01:55:40.200]  witnesses that you help bring forward so this is a big win for children it's a
[01:55:40.200 --> 01:55:45.360]  big win for women for men for victims of the sexual abuse cults like nexium all
[01:55:45.360 --> 01:55:48.480]  of them that seem to be just be permeating everywhere it's I think it's a
[01:55:48.480 --> 01:55:52.600]  very vampiric thing where you take sex it's a loving thing between adults
[01:55:52.600 --> 01:55:55.840]  whether they be you know men and women or whatever and you turn into some of a
[01:55:55.840 --> 01:56:01.560]  force thing I think this is just the basis of evil in our culture you're
[01:56:01.560 --> 01:56:05.120]  totally correct and the rabbit hole goes really deep something else that we
[01:56:05.120 --> 01:56:10.120]  exposed with the help of you know brave Brett S is there are organized
[01:56:10.120 --> 01:56:15.360]  networks in Hollywood for example there's a you know criminal named Brett
[01:56:15.360 --> 01:56:21.520]  Schulte he's not famous he has you know drugged and raped Brett S and he is the
[01:56:21.520 --> 01:56:27.520]  procurer of young boys not only for Hollywood director Brian Singer but also
[01:56:27.520 --> 01:56:30.960]  not interrupting you but it goes back to Bram Stoker's Dracula which is now
[01:56:30.960 --> 01:56:34.880]  where for life you have a Wren fields that that aren't raping the kids but
[01:56:34.880 --> 01:56:40.680]  they're supplying them right or they're supplying and raping and so the famous
[01:56:40.680 --> 01:56:45.680]  Hollywood director Gus Van Zandt also uses the same procurer as does the
[01:56:45.680 --> 01:56:50.600]  famous Hollywood comedian Andy Dick and others Roman Polanski get standing
[01:56:50.600 --> 01:56:55.960]  ovations when he admits he rate he would drug and rape little girls absolutely
[01:56:55.960 --> 01:57:01.040]  and Meryl Streep you know defense him even to the to this day so it's we're
[01:57:01.040 --> 01:57:06.280]  uncovering these networks bit by bit it really takes the courage of the victims
[01:57:06.280 --> 01:57:11.280]  to come forward and in our next segment you know I can break some very important
[01:57:11.280 --> 01:57:15.800]  news with your folks and info wars about what I'm going to do for victims of
[01:57:15.800 --> 01:57:19.120]  Charlie child sex abuse and Hollywood next to help bring more of that's
[01:57:19.120 --> 01:57:22.040]  amazing because Gabe I've seen your film it's amazing we promoted it and now
[01:57:22.040 --> 01:57:26.200]  it's all being documented and it's just total vindication which is kind of you
[01:57:26.200 --> 01:57:31.240]  think I feel good you were vindicated it makes people sick actually yeah it's
[01:57:31.240 --> 01:57:34.960]  like sickening that it's even worse than you said but you're a hero you're
[01:57:34.960 --> 01:57:38.600]  a cruiser hero you're a very successful guy and you took on the whole system so

[02:00:49.160 --> 02:00:53.800]  we should review the film here a year plus after they try to suppress it what
[02:00:53.800 --> 02:00:57.160]  two years ago correct me if I'm wrong and then you got it out a year ago and it
[02:00:57.160 --> 02:01:01.320]  went viral and now the main target you're exposing the person you use as the
[02:01:01.320 --> 02:01:05.480]  rabbit hole entry point is in deep deep trouble Gabe Hoffman you've got the floor
[02:01:05.480 --> 02:01:09.280]  of this segment part of the next what's the breaking news you want to impart to
[02:01:09.280 --> 02:01:15.440]  people sure so there are this is you know in the Atlantic this is Pulitzer
[02:01:15.440 --> 02:01:20.240]  prize level journalism everyone needs to go and and read this this is two
[02:01:20.240 --> 02:01:25.160]  journalists who deserve a Pulitzer they took almost a year they traveled all
[02:01:25.160 --> 02:01:28.680]  the way around the world Eastern Europe and other places they talked with
[02:01:28.680 --> 02:01:33.320]  victims of Brian Singer we gave them some leads they followed other leads truly
[02:01:33.320 --> 02:01:38.680]  incredible stuff Ronan Farrow won Pulitzer in 2017 for exposing Harvey
[02:01:38.680 --> 02:01:44.480]  Weinstein that's great guess what the work that Max and Alex did here is even
[02:01:44.480 --> 02:01:53.320]  more devastating why is the house of cards falling now pun intended it's
[02:01:53.320 --> 02:01:58.160]  falling now because victims are finally becoming brave enough to become
[02:01:58.160 --> 02:02:03.920]  survivors go on the record and talk just like the title says Alex you know
[02:02:03.920 --> 02:02:09.200]  nobody will believe you well that's what they all thought for so long and you
[02:02:09.200 --> 02:02:12.360]  know when you saw our film you saw the brave young men who are the real heroes
[02:02:12.360 --> 02:02:16.840]  in our film who didn't get paid a dime who came forward put their their real
[02:02:16.840 --> 02:02:21.720]  face on camera their their name everything that inspired more victims and
[02:02:21.720 --> 02:02:26.520]  now that's inspired even even more victims and we're gonna see over the
[02:02:26.520 --> 02:02:31.720]  coming months you know November 1st 2017 I have the clip I'll get it to you guys
[02:02:31.720 --> 02:02:38.600]  I was on with you and I talked about Dan Schneider the Hollywood producer big
[02:02:38.600 --> 02:02:43.160]  showrunner franchise guy for Nickelodeon and I said look out for Dan
[02:02:43.160 --> 02:02:48.600]  Schneider guess what five months later Dan Schneider fired from Nickelodeon
[02:02:48.600 --> 02:02:52.800]  there's more to come on Dan Schneider that's something I can go over in the
[02:02:52.800 --> 02:02:57.880]  future child sex abuse very very bad stuff this is just the beginning the
[02:02:57.880 --> 02:03:00.680]  tip of the iceberg I remember you saying all that so please send the
[02:03:00.680 --> 02:03:04.200]  producers a clips and whenever you name the time this week next week if we need
[02:03:04.200 --> 02:03:07.440]  to really I don't want to just have you on and go look you were right this is a
[02:03:07.440 --> 02:03:11.240]  big deal this is a huge deal this has got to scare the hell out of the people in
[02:03:11.240 --> 02:03:16.040]  Hollywood from your just deep research as a dead reckoning why are people so
[02:03:16.040 --> 02:03:20.600]  obsessed with raping women men children and and and what's the percentage I've
[02:03:20.600 --> 02:03:23.960]  talked a lot of folks in Hollywood they think that it will about a hundred
[02:03:23.960 --> 02:03:26.800]  percent are into weird deviant stuff you know they actually live in the city a
[02:03:26.800 --> 02:03:30.880]  lot of people move out and then I mean what percentages would you say are into
[02:03:30.880 --> 02:03:36.600]  pedophilia well out of the total child sex abuse in Hollywood our research shows
[02:03:36.600 --> 02:03:42.040]  it's about 80 20 that is 80 percent of the child sex abuses upon young men and
[02:03:42.040 --> 02:03:46.720]  20 percent approximately is upon young women we haven't heard much from young
[02:03:46.720 --> 02:03:52.520]  women we did hear from Elijah Dushku for example back in January how she came out
[02:03:52.520 --> 02:03:56.240]  and said that during the filming of true lies true lies which was the big hit of
[02:03:56.240 --> 02:03:59.760]  course with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Tom Arnold many years ago how there was a
[02:03:59.760 --> 02:04:04.720]  12 year old she was 12 years old the stunt coordinator had raped her I'm sorry
[02:04:04.720 --> 02:04:10.160]  had sexually abused her and what's amazing is this the tolerance for deviant
[02:04:10.160 --> 02:04:14.600]  behavior in Hollywood how she was called jail bait in front of everyone while
[02:04:14.600 --> 02:04:17.440]  she was getting you know put on to stunt gear and things like that by the
[02:04:17.440 --> 02:04:22.640]  stunt coordinator and nobody did anything or just like this Atlantic piece
[02:04:22.640 --> 02:04:27.040]  exposes with Brian Singer and this is really important how on the set of app
[02:04:27.040 --> 02:04:31.960]  pupil you have Brad Renfrow and if you can pull this up for your viewers the
[02:04:31.960 --> 02:04:36.200]  picture of Brad Renfrow this young Hollywood actor and how young he looked
[02:04:36.200 --> 02:04:41.920]  he was 14 15 years old and Brian Singer the director was going around according
[02:04:41.920 --> 02:04:46.520]  to the Atlantic on the set and he was calling him his boyfriend in front of

[02:06:36.920 --> 02:06:41.400]  pedophile networks of men women children but the mainly men and male
[02:06:41.400 --> 02:06:45.360]  children in Hollywood he made an open secret they tried to block the release
[02:06:45.360 --> 02:06:50.120]  of the recent free online six million views just on one platform and now you've
[02:06:50.120 --> 02:06:53.880]  got a major Atlantic monthly article documenting how he was right and this
[02:06:53.880 --> 02:06:58.320]  is gonna be the whole next domino to fall I want to invite him up next week
[02:06:58.320 --> 02:07:02.240]  whenever he chooses so we can really do the show proper for a TV show nice radio
[02:07:02.240 --> 02:07:05.560]  where we can show all the clips and the proof the things he's talking about but
[02:07:05.560 --> 02:07:09.360]  I know he was for real I know a lot of these names are even implicated but he's
[02:07:09.360 --> 02:07:14.640]  been vindicated and validated and a big way right now so that's pretty amazing
[02:07:14.640 --> 02:07:19.000]  so we salute him and the filmmakers and as he said Alex French and Maximilian
[02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:23.520]  Potter over at the Atlantic show in closing the few minutes we have left
[02:07:23.520 --> 02:07:26.440]  what else do you want to add and give people a preview what's gonna come up
[02:07:26.440 --> 02:07:30.680]  next week well sure this is a major announcement that I'm gonna make for the
[02:07:30.680 --> 02:07:35.560]  first time with you exclusively on info wars and I'm it's gonna be out on other
[02:07:35.560 --> 02:07:42.240]  media very soon that's this I have been contacted by a couple of stars in
[02:07:42.240 --> 02:07:47.120]  Hollywood who have been sexually abused as children they have signed non
[02:07:47.120 --> 02:07:51.680]  disclosure agreements they have gotten money from the studios to keep quiet they
[02:07:51.680 --> 02:07:56.080]  have gotten money from their abusers to keep quiet and I'm saying right here with
[02:07:56.080 --> 02:08:02.600]  you that based on California statute California statute says that non
[02:08:02.600 --> 02:08:07.920]  disclosure agreements do not apply to child sex abuse and what I am willing
[02:08:07.920 --> 02:08:12.320]  to do whether you are famous or you are not famous whether you were somebody or
[02:08:12.320 --> 02:08:17.240]  never got a single line if you're a child in Hollywood who got sexually abused
[02:08:17.240 --> 02:08:23.040]  as a minor and you got money you signed an NDA I believe it is not legally valid
[02:08:23.040 --> 02:08:29.960]  and what I am willing to do is you come to me I will put it in writing 100% I
[02:08:29.960 --> 02:08:34.040]  have one of the biggest and best law firms in Los Angeles behind me I am
[02:08:34.040 --> 02:08:39.480]  willing to 100% guarantee and pay for any and all legal costs because I know that
[02:08:39.480 --> 02:08:43.680]  these studios and these sexual abusers there is no way they have a case and
[02:08:43.680 --> 02:08:48.200]  there is no way they would ever want to get into discovery with me if I am your
[02:08:48.200 --> 02:08:54.080]  shield well and you're right under California law Texas law NDA is if
[02:08:54.080 --> 02:08:57.480]  you're giving people the secret to Coca-Cola or you're giving you're gonna
[02:08:57.480 --> 02:09:01.440]  release when the movie is coming out or what the strategy is it doesn't let you
[02:09:01.440 --> 02:09:07.000]  say oh you signed an NDA so we're gonna rob a bank tomorrow but you can't
[02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:11.560]  tell the police because you signed an NDA but they hoax these people to not
[02:09:11.560 --> 02:09:14.200]  understand that so you're absolutely right and the fact you're saying though
[02:09:14.200 --> 02:09:17.320]  they usually bullying them they target them that you're gonna back them you're
[02:09:17.320 --> 02:09:20.560]  a wealthy person I salute you and they've got to be really really scared
[02:09:20.560 --> 02:09:24.560]  right now because you've proven that you've fair to these guys out and as you
[02:09:24.560 --> 02:09:30.200]  said this guy's domino number one the big dominoes are about to fall there are a
[02:09:30.200 --> 02:09:33.920]  lot more where Brian Singer came from and I'm so glad to spend time with you
[02:09:33.920 --> 02:09:37.560]  on info wars Alex again the people really need to support what you're doing
[02:09:37.560 --> 02:09:41.680]  when you expose the child porn on Netflix when you expose what they're
[02:09:41.680 --> 02:09:46.560]  doing with underage drag kids when you expose things like these drag tots and
[02:09:46.560 --> 02:09:51.080]  these cartoons these sexualized cartoons on children you're doing something
[02:09:51.080 --> 02:09:55.160]  amazing you're doing God's work and the folks need to understand that the
[02:09:55.160 --> 02:09:59.200]  mainstream media does not do this sometimes they'll copy you once in a
[02:09:59.200 --> 02:10:03.200]  while but they will never these stories will never see the light of day oh yeah
[02:10:03.200 --> 02:10:05.520]  that's why it's so rare to have mainstream media even jump on this but you
[02:10:05.520 --> 02:10:08.920]  have the proof Gabe let us know we'll talk to you next week God bless amazing
[02:10:08.920 --> 02:10:13.720]  job thank you I am proud of info wars today we had Robert Barnes the lawyer
[02:10:13.720 --> 02:10:19.000]  for the Covington Catholic students that were demonized in line about his
[02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:22.840]  filing sues give you exclusives who he's gonna sue we said Gabe Hoffman on has
[02:10:22.840 --> 02:10:26.480]  been totally proven right in space you know I knew about his film years ago I
[02:10:26.480 --> 02:10:29.120]  knew about the connections I knew about a lot of it being true I know he was a
[02:10:29.120 --> 02:10:32.360]  guy managing billions of dollars so he wouldn't just do this for no reason but
[02:10:32.360 --> 02:10:35.600]  now he's been proven right it's all over the news it's the next big Weinstein
[02:10:35.600 --> 02:10:38.800]  thing you heard it here so you're literally getting next year's this is
[02:10:38.800 --> 02:10:41.880]  actually two years ago almost started here you're getting the news of two years
[02:10:41.880 --> 02:10:48.480]  ago too early it's amazing so we're blown away right now and joining us till
[02:10:48.480 --> 02:10:52.320]  about 45 after it's one of my favorite gas we want to get her to do some guest
[02:10:52.320 --> 02:10:56.280]  hosting with us but she's a busy person over in the UK and with Fox News and so
[02:10:56.280 --> 02:11:01.240]  much more Katie Hopkins KT Hopkins and since she's got Hopkins world and I
[02:11:01.240 --> 02:11:04.680]  wanted to get her on about Brexit and the yellow vest and the explosion of his
[02:11:04.680 --> 02:11:11.520]  Lomick rape games and just all of the insanity and Caracas on fire and what's
[02:11:11.520 --> 02:11:16.040]  happening here in America and all of it so Katie good to have you back thank you
[02:11:16.040 --> 02:11:19.080]  very much for having me it's good to be back good to see you it's great having
[02:11:19.080 --> 02:11:22.800]  here in Austin so what do you want to cover first I threw a few topics out but
[02:11:22.800 --> 02:11:27.080]  I bet you've got a bunch of others yeah for sure I mean the thing people are
[02:11:27.080 --> 02:11:31.040]  always asking about is Brexit where is it what's happening with it is it ever
[02:11:31.040 --> 02:11:34.760]  going to happen and I think from a British perspective at the moment you
[02:11:34.760 --> 02:11:39.760]  know 17.4 million people voted for Brexit we still don't have it and the
[02:11:39.760 --> 02:11:44.480]  British Parliament our members of Parliament are actively trying to
[02:11:44.480 --> 02:11:49.520]  prevent it happening so democracy in the UK is in a pretty sorry state right now
[02:11:49.520 --> 02:11:54.640]  and it looks like they're trying to stop no deal happening for the rest of us to
[02:11:54.640 --> 02:11:58.600]  vote for Brexit we'd love to leave without a deal tell the EU to stick it
[02:11:58.600 --> 02:12:03.280]  no we're not paying you any money no we don't want to be tied to you we're off
[02:12:03.280 --> 02:12:07.640]  but sadly that's not what our parliamentarians want so it looks like we
[02:12:07.640 --> 02:12:13.120]  won't get Brexit as we envisaged it after all and again people say oh you
[02:12:13.120 --> 02:12:16.520]  voted for it but now you didn't get it but it's the process of you never voted
[02:12:16.520 --> 02:12:20.640]  to enter the EU it's dictatorial now you vote two plus years ago to leave they
[02:12:20.640 --> 02:12:24.080]  won't let you I always predicted that in the end it would blow up in their face
[02:12:24.080 --> 02:12:27.960]  and it looks like Theresa May and all their shenanigans and scalduggery
[02:12:27.960 --> 02:12:32.600]  isn't working A is that true and then B they voted just a few days ago back to
[02:12:32.600 --> 02:12:37.040]  it up to have an EU army they always denied and then Merkel and Macron got
[02:12:37.040 --> 02:12:42.200]  booed and now you know Davos has walls guarding them but you know the United
[02:12:42.200 --> 02:12:46.560]  States can't I mean it seems like we can lose battles but overall I think we're
[02:12:46.560 --> 02:12:51.680]  winning the war yeah I feel the same way as you so we're losing the battle we're
[02:12:51.680 --> 02:12:55.800]  losing the battle for Brexit for sure and Theresa May and others have been
[02:12:55.800 --> 02:13:00.000]  trying to thwart this process ever since we voted leave and it's been horrible
[02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:04.720]  to watch but in a way Alex there's a good news item to come out of this because
[02:13:04.720 --> 02:13:09.040]  I think it's really helped to wake people up you know people genuinely want to
[02:13:09.040 --> 02:13:14.240]  believe in democracy I completely understand that but this is really shown
[02:13:14.240 --> 02:13:18.720]  it's really exemplified for the nation that actually democracy doesn't really
[02:13:18.720 --> 02:13:23.480]  exist actually we just being patted on the head and the powerful and the
[02:13:23.480 --> 02:13:27.200]  establishment will always decide what's going to happen no matter what and in a
[02:13:27.200 --> 02:13:31.840]  way in terms of winning the war absolutely for so long the people that
[02:13:31.840 --> 02:13:36.880]  supported leave people like myself Brexiteers warned about the EU army we
[02:13:36.880 --> 02:13:41.560]  were told we were conspiracy theorists we were told we were making things up
[02:13:41.560 --> 02:13:46.200]  that a EU army was never going to happen of course right now Merkel and
[02:13:46.200 --> 02:13:50.760]  Macron you know cozying up together get builders said it best when he just
[02:13:50.760 --> 02:13:54.880]  tweeted losers and I think that's exactly right what I can see next is the
[02:13:54.880 --> 02:13:59.520]  German police going into France to help Macron with his yellow vest and you'll
[02:13:59.520 --> 02:14:04.480]  notice Alex of course the mainstream media aren't very keen to cover the
[02:14:04.480 --> 02:14:10.120]  yellow vest protests which are building and growing week on week on week it's
[02:14:10.120 --> 02:14:15.200]  amazing let's get more into the yellow vest we're like what 13 14 weeks in they
[02:14:15.200 --> 02:14:17.560]  shoot it when rubber bullets they shoot them in real bullets it doesn't back
[02:14:17.560 --> 02:14:21.640]  them down the crown is just hanging on by his fingernails Merkel's already been
[02:14:21.640 --> 02:14:25.240]  voted out her party she's still in office and then here they are with a
[02:14:25.240 --> 02:14:29.160]  little crowd of 30 people waving EU flags but even though the streets are
[02:14:29.160 --> 02:14:32.960]  blocked up miles we'll play a clip when we come back you can still hear the roar
[02:14:32.960 --> 02:14:41.240]  of booze I mean this is beautiful so let me ask you what would you call this
[02:14:41.240 --> 02:14:47.880]  moment for the EU I mean this is crazy town because the idea of a EU army is
[02:14:47.880 --> 02:14:52.920]  ridiculous it's something that you know even if you are a fan of the EU I think
[02:14:52.920 --> 02:14:58.120]  you can see that it really infringes on our sovereignty I think from a perspective
[02:14:58.120 --> 02:15:01.680]  you know many of our grandparents fought in the war against Germany they didn't
[02:15:01.680 --> 02:15:05.800]  give up just because they happen to be sat next to Angela Merkel which feels
[02:15:05.800 --> 02:15:11.200]  like Macron just sacrificed France at the altar of Merkel because I think he's
[02:15:11.200 --> 02:15:15.640]  genuinely scared because he knows he's lost control of his country but what's
[02:15:15.640 --> 02:15:19.040]  glorious to see and what of course the mainstream media aren't showing are these
[02:15:19.040 --> 02:15:23.080]  yellow vest protestors you know they've been out week after week after week it
[02:15:23.080 --> 02:15:27.720]  was Act 10 last weekend they've done a great job they've taken down all the
[02:15:27.720 --> 02:15:32.480]  speed cameras in France have been destroyed they are targeted in the way
[02:15:32.480 --> 02:15:36.920]  that they operate they're effective they're shutting various areas and they
[02:15:36.920 --> 02:15:42.000]  say that movement's going to build and like you say despite being fired at with
[02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:45.880]  these rubber bullets fired out with these tear gas round many of them have
[02:15:45.880 --> 02:15:49.360]  lost an eye or being quite you know greatly injured they're not giving up

[02:20:26.440 --> 02:20:31.160]  information in the last few days not from the White House not from the Pentagon
[02:20:31.160 --> 02:20:37.080]  not from the CIA but from big companies out there about what really happened us
[02:20:37.080 --> 02:20:43.120]  seven months ago and we've talked to some of the people at the highest levels
[02:20:43.120 --> 02:20:49.880]  for this one on they said you weren't taken off YouTube that was Facebook and
[02:20:49.880 --> 02:20:56.000]  ample made the decision someone went in and deleted it all without us being
[02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:59.920]  authorized and I actually told this by some people the day it happened they
[02:20:59.920 --> 02:21:03.640]  said hey this watch she wasn't the people that head up Google these companies are
[02:21:03.640 --> 02:21:07.320]  so big so out of control they have so many intelligence agencies and we don't
[02:21:07.320 --> 02:21:12.600]  know that's the level of sabotage going on the left and we it's the same thing
[02:21:12.600 --> 02:21:18.240]  with Roku and I'm gonna leave it at that we've we've we've confirmed that Roku
[02:21:18.240 --> 02:21:21.760]  said no first amendment we're not doing it the director of Roku's a listener and
[02:21:21.760 --> 02:21:26.760]  then it was just done and then once it's done how do you respond how do you then
[02:21:26.760 --> 02:21:30.720]  back off of that when the head of Roku said no it's free speech trying to take
[02:21:30.720 --> 02:21:34.520]  him down the quote Sandy Hook family lawyers came out and said he's sending
[02:21:34.520 --> 02:21:38.400]  people to our houses right now help us help us not a first amendment issue but
[02:21:38.400 --> 02:21:44.240]  a security issue didn't happen and so let me tell you evil always strikes first
[02:21:44.240 --> 02:21:49.120]  but then good takes time but it comes back stronger Katie Hopkins of Hopkins
[02:21:49.120 --> 02:21:54.720]  world at KT Hopkins amazing filmmaker I want to get into something you've been
[02:21:54.720 --> 02:21:58.800]  talking about for a decade you and Tommy Robinson really the sole people
[02:21:58.800 --> 02:22:02.600]  doing this and now it's mainstream news they've gone from denying no-go zones
[02:22:02.600 --> 02:22:08.520]  and grooming gangs to it's suddenly mainstream news half of major cities in
[02:22:08.520 --> 02:22:12.960]  Sweden off limits there's there's no plumbers won't go in refrigerated repair
[02:22:12.960 --> 02:22:18.880]  people won't go in FedEx won't go in the DHL won't go in and and it's all being
[02:22:18.880 --> 02:22:23.240]  confirmed so it's building towards the head even liberal countries are calling
[02:22:23.240 --> 02:22:28.880]  for walls now violent crime up 90% in England and Wales what is going on here
[02:22:28.880 --> 02:22:34.040]  it's a crazy nurse Alex and I'm just referring back there to you being kind
[02:22:34.040 --> 02:22:38.400]  of taken off of platforms to a censored from another platform I think one of the
[02:22:38.400 --> 02:22:41.240]  things that's very striking today when you listen to the social media
[02:22:41.240 --> 02:22:45.440]  conversation is so many commentators saying well hold on a minute Alex Jones
[02:22:45.440 --> 02:22:49.400]  was taken off these platforms because he was supposed to have done this or this
[02:22:49.400 --> 02:22:53.640]  but when you see the Covington Catholic School being attacked and those boys
[02:22:53.640 --> 02:22:56.960]  being attacked of course the left-wing are allowed to stay up when they've been
[02:22:56.960 --> 02:23:01.360]  attacking people so I think people like you say are starting to see the
[02:23:01.360 --> 02:23:05.360]  hypocrisy is playing out people defending your corner saying that this is
[02:23:05.360 --> 02:23:09.520]  unfair which is great to see people waking up and as you say I'm just back
[02:23:09.520 --> 02:23:14.760]  from Finland Finland is kind of the unknown place so everyone talks about
[02:23:14.760 --> 02:23:18.800]  Sweden especially since Trump did Finland doesn't get talked about and as a
[02:23:18.800 --> 02:23:23.560]  result the grooming gangs operating in Finland think that they are below the
[02:23:23.560 --> 02:23:29.640]  radar I went there I went nearly into the Arctic Circle in Oulu to talk about
[02:23:29.640 --> 02:23:33.320]  the grooming gangs to make them talk about their problem and they really
[02:23:33.320 --> 02:23:36.640]  still have their heads in the sand there they're saying well maybe these these
[02:23:36.640 --> 02:23:41.000]  attacks aren't connected you know maybe it's not the fault of the men maybe it's
[02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:45.240]  some education programs we need for migrants well no they don't need
[02:23:45.240 --> 02:23:50.920]  education they need deporting we need deportation if you come to our
[02:23:50.920 --> 02:23:56.760]  countries to attack our children we need to be sending you home so Finland this
[02:23:56.760 --> 02:24:03.160]  place nearly in the Arctic Circle is now a target for grooming gangs majority
[02:24:03.160 --> 02:24:08.920]  Muslim grooming gangs it's almost unbelievable it's minus 20 let me let
[02:24:08.920 --> 02:24:12.240]  me interrupt because I remember about a year ago it was on YouTube for a while
[02:24:12.240 --> 02:24:17.280]  it was a 20-minute video of in Sweden at one of these anti-racism events
[02:24:17.280 --> 02:24:21.120]  liberal women went to it was almost all Muslim men and there they've got her
[02:24:21.120 --> 02:24:25.400]  legs spread out they're raping her like 20 guys are lined up and you look at the
[02:24:25.400 --> 02:24:29.360]  look on her face a pure horror while they're raping the hell out of her and
[02:24:29.360 --> 02:24:33.880]  the police are 20 feet away doing nothing that's so archetypal and we aired
[02:24:33.880 --> 02:24:37.320]  it you couldn't see penetration we can see they're raping her stations complained
[02:24:37.320 --> 02:24:40.480]  and said don't show that hey we're showing something right now that's
[02:24:40.480 --> 02:24:43.440]  another woman being grabbed and raped this is what they do these liberal
[02:24:43.440 --> 02:24:48.520]  women go to these events and then get raped and can't believe it it's it's
[02:24:48.520 --> 02:24:52.960]  revolting and I'm having spent time in the no-go zones of Sweden you know the
[02:24:52.960 --> 02:24:57.760]  one thing the girls there Swedish girls are frightened of actually is not just
[02:24:57.760 --> 02:25:01.600]  the migrant men that they're being attacked by they're frightened of the
[02:25:01.600 --> 02:25:06.600]  Swedish feminists because the Swedish feminists are operating against them the
[02:25:06.600 --> 02:25:11.560]  Swedish feminists made it so they're not allowed to spray pepper spray in Sweden
[02:25:11.560 --> 02:25:16.480]  to defend themselves in case they spray the wrong attacker that's the madness
[02:25:16.480 --> 02:25:20.560]  that we're now suffering from in Western Europe and it shows no sign of
[02:25:20.560 --> 02:25:27.000]  stopping soon so what is the end game as I've seen European courts the
[02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:30.840]  headlines rule Muslim man raped a nine-year-old it's his religion it's
[02:25:30.840 --> 02:25:34.800]  okay so they're and teaching German school girls and after-school videos
[02:25:34.800 --> 02:25:39.360]  that get your Muslim man it's good to get married at 14 where you're a jib I
[02:25:39.360 --> 02:25:44.800]  mean clearly trying to get people to go to Islam what is the end game of this
[02:25:44.800 --> 02:25:49.680]  well frankly enough you know and it's always my message to Americans to your
[02:25:49.680 --> 02:25:54.520]  good audiences do not become like us do not let yourself fall as we have fallen
[02:25:54.520 --> 02:26:01.520]  tomorrow I go to a town in the UK that is 98% Muslim out of four and a half
[02:26:01.520 --> 02:26:08.720]  thousand residents there are only 48 white Brits left and by 2035 in four of
[02:26:08.720 --> 02:26:14.600]  our major cities Muslim births outnumber white Christian births and I think
[02:26:14.600 --> 02:26:18.480]  that's a terrifying thing you know we are far down that road and what you're
[02:26:18.480 --> 02:26:23.800]  seeing is an exodus of people looking for a new place to live Jews returning to
[02:26:23.800 --> 02:26:29.840]  Israel and from France and also now Brits looking towards Hungary and Poland as
[02:26:29.840 --> 02:26:35.480]  it's a new place to call a lot of Germans are moving to Russia and again if
[02:26:35.480 --> 02:26:40.040]  the people came in and assimilated so what of our skin gets browner the thing
[02:26:40.040 --> 02:26:43.400]  is they don't assimilate and they go you're allowed to rape and kill us it's
[02:26:43.400 --> 02:26:48.960]  like they're above the law it's exactly right it's no no one's coming here to
[02:26:48.960 --> 02:26:53.120]  like be part of our culture in fact they specifically talk about the fact they
[02:26:53.120 --> 02:26:56.840]  need to keep themselves separate from Western culture because they don't agree
[02:26:56.840 --> 02:27:01.080]  with it when I was in Finland there was a teaching in the mosque at that time
[02:27:01.080 --> 02:27:05.760]  they had a lollipop one lollipop was uncovered and covered in flies one
[02:27:05.760 --> 02:27:09.880]  lollipop was covered up in its wrapping and that was the message from the imam
[02:27:09.880 --> 02:27:15.280]  is that uncovered women finish women European women are dirty therefore
[02:27:15.280 --> 02:27:20.120]  anybody can use their game that's been bought in mosques and that's the whole
[02:27:20.120 --> 02:27:23.280]  Islamic thing is everything in Islam is house of Islam without is the house of
[02:27:23.280 --> 02:27:27.680]  war so they can deal drugs pedophilia I mean it's just it's a great system you
[02:27:27.680 --> 02:27:30.400]  know your mom and your sister at home wearing burqas we can go out and rape
[02:27:30.400 --> 02:27:35.040]  five-year-olds if you want there's a sense that we're dirty you know we get
[02:27:35.040 --> 02:27:39.720]  called white trash white well worse than that and because we are uncovered we're
[02:27:39.720 --> 02:27:44.880]  fair game or easy meat and therefore it's acceptable for Muslim men to be
[02:27:44.880 --> 02:27:48.360]  raping our children because we put ourselves out there uncovered but they
[02:27:48.360 --> 02:27:53.880]  sure still fight to get into our evil dirty countries for sure and it's one
[02:27:53.880 --> 02:27:58.560]  of my big questions it remains my big question if Islam is so fantastic why
[02:27:58.560 --> 02:28:02.880]  do you always come to Christian lands why don't you say in countries that have
[02:28:02.880 --> 02:28:07.320]  Islam as their religion why do you always come to our countries it's really
[02:28:07.320 --> 02:28:12.080]  frustrating to me that we give up so easily as well we spend far too little
[02:28:12.080 --> 02:28:17.480]  time defending our culture far too much time tiptoeing around the cultures and
[02:28:17.480 --> 02:28:21.600]  the problems of others I think we need to be much stronger and it's why I
[02:28:21.600 --> 02:28:25.480]  support Trump with his closing down of everything I love it absolutely and
[02:28:25.480 --> 02:28:28.520]  let's say it again what Pakistanis are less than one half of one percent God

[02:33:38.640 --> 02:33:47.280]  tender hearted woman saw a poor half frozen snake his pretty colored skin
[02:33:47.280 --> 02:33:53.880]  had been all frosted with the dew oh well she cried I'll take you in and I'll

[02:34:24.880 --> 02:34:32.320]  brought you in by now you might have died she stroked his pretty skin and then
[02:34:32.320 --> 02:34:40.440]  she kissed and held him tight but instead of saying thank you that snake gave
[02:34:40.440 --> 02:34:49.200]  her a vicious bite I saved you cried the woman and you've bit me heavens wide
[02:34:49.200 --> 02:34:57.200]  you know your bite is poisonous and now I'm going to die oh shut up silly woman

[02:35:05.040 --> 02:35:23.640]  me in from the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones pretty
[02:35:23.640 --> 02:35:27.480]  powerful interview starting about two hours ago or more than two hours ago
[02:35:27.480 --> 02:35:34.720]  with the lawyer for the children who were demonized in line about just
[02:35:34.720 --> 02:35:39.120]  Saturday you just five days ago and it captured the world's attention because
[02:35:39.120 --> 02:35:42.520]  it was all rigged it was all a setup and the media kept going with it now it's
[02:35:42.520 --> 02:35:46.120]  blown up in their face but the lawyers announced who they're gonna sue that
[02:35:46.120 --> 02:35:51.320]  incredible video will be posted soon info wars.com I thought folks want might
[02:35:51.320 --> 02:35:55.320]  want to know who the families announced there are officially suing but hey we're
[02:35:55.320 --> 02:35:58.880]  just info wars you know kind of like our news is like that you know flying

[02:36:02.120 --> 02:36:06.560]  know what the hell but that's all gonna be coming up Katie Hopkins the time we
[02:36:06.560 --> 02:36:09.240]  have left this one segment you're a smart cookie a great investigative
[02:36:09.240 --> 02:36:13.120]  journalist where do you see Trump going what else do you see on the radar screen
[02:36:13.120 --> 02:36:17.840]  how would you describe this point that we're in the world right now yes well
[02:36:17.840 --> 02:36:22.600]  first up Alex you know not everybody disregards info wars at all you know I'm
[02:36:22.600 --> 02:36:26.840]  part of your support club I'm part of your reminding that you that you do a
[02:36:26.840 --> 02:36:31.880]  good job last time I was with you I sat and told you your staff love you because
[02:36:31.880 --> 02:36:35.800]  you're a loyal man and you believe in what you say so don't knock yourself too
[02:36:35.800 --> 02:36:39.920]  much because you've got a great deal of support out there second up you will
[02:36:39.920 --> 02:36:43.760]  find out that you are on the right side of history so whilst we might get
[02:36:43.760 --> 02:36:48.000]  demonized right now I might be arrested I might be fined I might be threatened I
[02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:51.800]  might be beheaded we will be on the right side of history and that's a
[02:36:51.800 --> 02:36:55.280]  glorious thing as for Trump and the wall I love it the more he keeps this
[02:36:55.280 --> 02:37:01.000]  going fantastic state of emergency bring it on do not give in to Nancy Pelosi a
[02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:04.560]  because she has dreadful teeth and I'm saying that as a British person and we
[02:37:04.560 --> 02:37:09.360]  have the worst teeth on the planet but B because I think the war matters because
[02:37:09.360 --> 02:37:14.160]  we live in a country that's already fallen Western Europe has fallen you have
[02:37:14.160 --> 02:37:18.800]  this one chance this one chance in history to defend your nation and it
[02:37:18.800 --> 02:37:23.160]  doesn't matter if it takes 50 weeks it doesn't matter this is worth fighting
[02:37:23.160 --> 02:37:26.640]  for so I'm with Trump all the way I would say as well if you're a furloughed
[02:37:26.640 --> 02:37:31.200]  worker not wishing to be unkind but do we really need you like are you really
[02:37:31.200 --> 02:37:34.920]  vital or are you just a bit surplus to requirements can't quite work that one
[02:37:34.920 --> 02:37:40.080]  out but I think Trump's doing a great thing and I so hope he digs in I so hope
[02:37:40.080 --> 02:37:47.640]  he doesn't cave to Nancy Pelosi well my issue is he's already compromised on
[02:37:47.640 --> 02:37:50.640]  stuff he said he would have you been here for many years and you can prove
[02:37:50.640 --> 02:37:53.120]  you're not a criminal he already said that three years ago he was running
[02:37:53.120 --> 02:37:56.120]  they're not going to compromise on anything because they want to shut the
[02:37:56.120 --> 02:38:00.640]  economy down to kill his presidency so he just declared the emergency that's in
[02:38:00.640 --> 02:38:05.120]  the Constitution the Bill of Rights he has the funding and just checkmated him
[02:38:05.120 --> 02:38:08.600]  all the way around just built the damn wall without their funding that would be
[02:38:08.600 --> 02:38:11.840]  true leadership so I get there in the wrong with the shutdown I get they're
[02:38:11.840 --> 02:38:15.320]  not compromising I get they're saying Trump's down winning the shutdown but
[02:38:15.320 --> 02:38:19.440]  but but why not bypass the whole fake contest and declare the damn emergency
[02:38:19.440 --> 02:38:23.360]  yes of course and I think that's where this needs to move to I think he now
[02:38:23.360 --> 02:38:27.200]  needs to move to declaring the state of emergency take the cash build the wall
[02:38:27.200 --> 02:38:31.400]  deal with the arguments later everyone will get over it you cannot but look at
[02:38:31.400 --> 02:38:35.400]  the examples of my country of Western Europe and see the mess we're in and
[02:38:35.400 --> 02:38:39.960]  not believe Trump is on the right side of course Democrats won all of that lot
[02:38:39.960 --> 02:38:43.600]  in they want half of Mexico in because those are the ones that will vote for
[02:38:43.600 --> 02:38:47.680]  them you know that's never been a good way to make political decisions so I
[02:38:47.680 --> 02:38:51.280]  stand with Trump and like so many of the other leaders we have that are
[02:38:51.280 --> 02:38:55.720]  fabulous like Salvini you know like the AFD in Germany they just get
[02:38:55.720 --> 02:39:00.240]  misrepresented and underrepresented in the press I think the amount of support
[02:39:00.240 --> 02:39:05.280]  out there for populist leaders has never been greater I think these are
[02:39:05.280 --> 02:39:10.720]  exciting times to be on our side of the bench I would describe it like this
[02:39:10.720 --> 02:39:14.240]  Katie the globalist and the corrupt corporate forces that want us to be
[02:39:14.240 --> 02:39:17.360]  socialized so we're under their control while their tax exempt offshore
[02:39:17.360 --> 02:39:22.240]  fabulously rich but teaching us that for middle class were bad they were kind of
[02:39:22.240 --> 02:39:26.840]  asleep and arrogant and now that Trump and then breaks it before that and what's
[02:39:26.840 --> 02:39:30.560]  happened in Brazil and everywhere else and Italy is scaring them now they're
[02:39:30.560 --> 02:39:34.040]  mobilized and attacking but good old-fashioned bullying may have a
[02:39:34.040 --> 02:39:37.840]  little bit of an effect up front but it's going to trigger really systemic
[02:39:37.840 --> 02:39:44.120]  a stiff upper lip and I go back to the British example Hitler was only bombing
[02:39:44.120 --> 02:39:47.560]  military targets in the British were 90% against war because they lost millions
[02:39:47.560 --> 02:39:50.680]  of people in World War I as soon as Hitler went I'll intimidate them and all
[02:39:50.680 --> 02:39:55.280]  bombs the billion targets it went 90% for the war and lines of people ready to
[02:39:55.280 --> 02:39:59.000]  kill and so I the globalist I think have a blind spot they think messing with us
[02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:02.960]  and intimidating us and going after kids is going to make us roll over because I
[02:40:02.960 --> 02:40:08.040]  guess that's how they are instead it makes us go into war mode I think you're
[02:40:08.040 --> 02:40:10.760]  right and I think I think the yellow vest that you're showing there the
[02:40:10.760 --> 02:40:15.720]  Gilles Jaune in Paris has really shown that that's the reason Macron has gone
[02:40:15.720 --> 02:40:19.840]  running running running running running under Merkel's wing because he's scared
[02:40:19.840 --> 02:40:25.400]  he knows he's under threat he knows that this lot are not gonna stop until he is
[02:40:25.400 --> 02:40:30.120]  out of office and I think that increasing sense that the people only can go
[02:40:30.120 --> 02:40:34.600]  to put push so far before they fight back I just love what the French are
[02:40:34.600 --> 02:40:39.280]  doing I wish I wish the Brits would do the same if we don't get our Brexit my
[02:40:39.280 --> 02:40:42.640]  fear is that the British will have that whole British polite thing and have a
[02:40:42.640 --> 02:40:46.120]  cup of tea and feel better about themselves instead I love what the
[02:40:46.120 --> 02:40:50.160]  French are doing I'm dying to see the day that Macron gets taken down I can't
[02:40:50.160 --> 02:40:54.160]  stand that little boy and I can't stand Merkel either she could murder both of
[02:40:54.160 --> 02:40:58.320]  her parents in the night still turn up to the European Court in her jumpsuit
[02:40:58.320 --> 02:41:03.720]  ready business the next day weird woman well the people think about France and
[02:41:03.720 --> 02:41:07.480]  say they're a bunch of whims no they had Napoleon and they had all the wars
[02:41:07.480 --> 02:41:10.800]  with the Austrian here an empire and the British they're one of the most war-like
[02:41:10.800 --> 02:41:14.680]  empires ever but they killed most their men over and over again mothers and
[02:41:14.680 --> 02:41:17.880]  others got sick of war and told their sons don't be involved in it as the same
[02:41:17.880 --> 02:41:21.440]  thing with England you know some of the biggest wars ever but not not some of
[02:41:21.440 --> 02:41:24.600]  the biggest all the biggest ones people fundamentally becoming it's war and I
[02:41:24.600 --> 02:41:29.280]  get that but then when you're occupied domestically by a political enemy then
[02:41:29.280 --> 02:41:33.240]  you're like well let's not have a war no this is the real war politically you've
[02:41:33.240 --> 02:41:36.400]  got to have and like you said you think of the French is these big whims you
[02:41:36.400 --> 02:41:41.040]  know historically they weren't just the last 80 years or so finally when they
[02:41:41.040 --> 02:41:45.560]  get angry and stand up I think finally when the UK gets angry and stands up
[02:41:45.560 --> 02:41:49.320]  it's not a bunch of Islamists burning stuff you know people's cars when it's
[02:41:49.320 --> 02:41:53.120]  targeted Brits burning Islamic areas which I'm not calling for I think once
[02:41:53.120 --> 02:41:57.400]  the Venera civilization peels off that's why you see all the imperial
[02:41:57.400 --> 02:42:00.960]  conditioning of Brits and others to be passive because the system fears them
[02:42:00.960 --> 02:42:04.000]  and I but I think those old instincts are gonna flare back if the political
[02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:07.240]  system doesn't back off and I think they've showed the seeds of quite
[02:42:07.240 --> 02:42:11.200]  frankly I don't call it fascism but a very vicious populism that could become
[02:42:11.200 --> 02:42:15.680]  quite dangerous and I agree with you entirely and I think it's that sort of
[02:42:15.680 --> 02:42:19.840]  sense that people have woken up so we saw the kind of global compact on
[02:42:19.840 --> 02:42:23.520]  migration happening and they're more signing that to say that everybody can
[02:42:23.520 --> 02:42:26.720]  move wherever they like and we didn't really like that much then we saw the
[02:42:26.720 --> 02:42:31.800]  EU army being talked about it's these super national organization that makes
[02:42:31.800 --> 02:42:35.480]  us kind of prick up our ears and think hold on a minute we're really losing
[02:42:35.480 --> 02:42:39.520]  control here of what matters to us that's right you're saying I didn't vote to

[02:43:54.280 --> 02:43:59.200]  living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is the real
[02:43:59.200 --> 02:44:03.480]  drama can be found here in Lailania States but a lot of us on the big island
[02:44:03.480 --> 02:44:07.840]  rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain
[02:44:07.840 --> 02:44:13.320]  volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the
[02:44:13.320 --> 02:44:18.360]  pH of the water to unhealthy levels to find out we employ the series of tests
[02:44:18.360 --> 02:44:23.920]  for heavy metals alkalinity and pH what we learned was that there was in fact
[02:44:23.920 --> 02:44:29.040]  unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater next we tested
[02:44:29.040 --> 02:44:33.360]  the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal
[02:44:33.360 --> 02:44:39.360]  levels within safe measure but the pH was also restored to optimal levels as it
[02:44:39.360 --> 02:44:44.760]  turns out the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water so what we've
[02:44:44.760 --> 02:44:49.280]  learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply
[02:44:49.280 --> 02:44:56.200]  but more importantly a good water filtration system will purify it we're

[02:51:30.200 --> 02:51:37.360]  how it is your support of the transmission that makes all of this
[02:51:37.360 --> 02:51:43.640]  possible so I'm just very very very very lucky to be here I'm very very blessed
[02:51:43.640 --> 02:51:49.080]  to be on air and I just want to thank all of you for what you've done over the
[02:51:49.080 --> 02:51:52.560]  years because listen sometimes I'm a train wreck and I'm out of control and I

[02:52:04.560 --> 02:52:10.800]  said I have not come to grips with how I'm supposed to announce this and then
[02:52:10.800 --> 02:52:13.400]  that's how I always say this is coming up and I announce it right there but I
[02:52:13.400 --> 02:52:16.440]  need to really think about this and look at it carefully before my ten
[02:52:16.440 --> 02:52:21.720]  announcements I'm not quite sure what's happening or what we should do but we're
[02:52:21.720 --> 02:52:24.840]  not gonna be able to expand and if we're not expanding that means we're
[02:52:24.840 --> 02:52:29.400]  contracting and then I look up and I say I haven't cut new ads in weeks I don't
[02:52:29.400 --> 02:52:32.640]  promote the products we've got so it's my fault but the same time I just want to
[02:52:32.640 --> 02:52:37.040]  cover news I just need everybody listening to understand this is history
[02:52:37.040 --> 02:52:41.280]  happening and if you don't go by the products and if you don't routinely buy
[02:52:41.280 --> 02:52:44.160]  them sign up for auto ship to get fluoride free to toothpaste that's

[02:53:19.680 --> 02:53:25.000]  above them well that won't fit in the capsule okay we're 20% above the very
[02:53:25.000 --> 02:53:32.600]  best and we're lower price that's our bodies turmeric our fish oil the best the
[02:53:32.600 --> 02:53:37.960]  cleanest the best the cleanest and a price lower than they sell Jeff Bezos at
[02:53:37.960 --> 02:53:45.960]  the damn Whole Foods I'll tell you again my job would be a lot easier if I
[02:53:45.960 --> 02:53:50.160]  didn't spend my time and I'm not bitching here scrounging around for
[02:53:50.160 --> 02:53:54.240]  money but you can sure as hell see that we're in the fight for our lives so
[02:53:54.240 --> 02:53:57.800]  you've all been committed to us and you bought a ton of great product that you
[02:53:57.800 --> 02:54:05.560]  love average 5.8 star on third-party review sites but if I don't get up here
[02:54:05.560 --> 02:54:10.960]  and explain to people that it's do or die people don't take action don't get
[02:54:10.960 --> 02:54:19.960]  the product so here's what it comes down to I don't want to cancel some of the
[02:54:19.960 --> 02:54:25.000]  shows we've already have and I sure as hell don't want to start curtailing how
[02:54:25.000 --> 02:54:28.600]  many reporters we have we need more reporters we had four for the women's

[02:54:36.520 --> 02:54:39.720]  hasn't been in views you'd have a budget of five million dollars profit ten
[02:54:39.720 --> 02:54:44.360]  million dollars an episode they make 15 million dollars off 20 million views you
[02:54:44.360 --> 02:54:47.120]  know how much money we made off 20 million views with our auxiliary
[02:54:47.120 --> 02:54:53.160]  reporters on their own sites zero I pay for the planes the hotels the cameras
[02:54:53.160 --> 02:54:58.000]  the legal the insurance and I'm not complaining but you know what it's
[02:54:58.000 --> 02:55:01.880]  about the mission to get the views to win the war against the pedophile

[03:00:25.360 --> 03:00:36.720]  everything's happy everything's good world war three cometh Syria is threatening to
[03:00:36.720 --> 03:00:41.720]  bomb the airport in Tel Aviv and Iran is pledging to wipe Israel off the map now
[03:00:41.720 --> 03:00:45.840]  you know why the United States is pulling back like we always do before
[03:00:45.840 --> 03:00:51.960]  Israel gets into another war big things happening Venezuela on fire at least
[03:00:51.960 --> 03:00:57.480]  seven shot dead by the dictatorship that has been holding on to power through
[03:00:57.480 --> 03:01:02.760]  stage elections the country has been a state of collapse for more than a decade
[03:01:02.760 --> 03:01:06.720]  and of course President Trump has recognized the opposition leader
[03:01:06.720 --> 03:01:12.480]  yesterday accelerating the crisis Russia and others because they have bases of
[03:01:12.480 --> 03:01:18.840]  Venezuela have condemned the United States but quite frankly Trump's move is
[03:01:18.840 --> 03:01:24.600]  right Maduro clearly is a dictator and a horrible globalist backed up by Hollywood
[03:01:24.600 --> 03:01:28.240]  and others so too bad for the Russians if the Venezuelan people actually get
[03:01:28.240 --> 03:01:33.680]  control of their government yeah there's Trump's second on inauguration video
[03:01:33.680 --> 03:01:39.920]  actually it's actually it's Caracas we're up to a million people flooded the
[03:01:39.920 --> 03:01:45.680]  streets now all CNN would have to do is just show a photo from the day before
[03:01:45.680 --> 03:01:48.920]  when no one was in the streets and say look no one is in the streets of
[03:01:48.920 --> 03:01:56.840]  Caracas that's what they did back on inauguration day 2017 remember they just
[03:01:56.840 --> 03:02:01.720]  showed it when the mall at first opened and said no one was there not showing the
[03:02:01.720 --> 03:02:05.560]  record crowd but I just thought that was a good point to make now imagine the
[03:02:05.560 --> 03:02:11.280]  military try to disperse everybody shot at least seven people dead wounding
[03:02:11.280 --> 03:02:14.680]  many others many others drug off to dungeons that are already basically full
[03:02:14.680 --> 03:02:20.000]  of people as the country completely collapses epic footage we're gonna have
[03:02:20.000 --> 03:02:25.680]  shots of the armored vehicles exploding we're gonna have shots of the people
[03:02:25.680 --> 03:02:30.920]  being shot so viewer discretion advised that is coming up in the next segment
[03:02:30.920 --> 03:02:37.520]  we'll look more at Israel after a couple days of blaming the Covington Catholic
[03:02:37.520 --> 03:02:45.240]  school kids of being horrible demons the media then said okay maybe they weren't
[03:02:45.240 --> 03:02:49.160]  but they're still evil because they were in red hats and they're white well now
[03:02:49.160 --> 03:02:53.280]  they've doubled down all over the place New York Times you name it MSNBC and
[03:02:53.280 --> 03:02:58.320]  they go you know what those kids are bad and black guys calling them cracker
[03:02:58.320 --> 03:03:02.880]  asses and saying will harvest your organs is actually a good thing and the
[03:03:02.880 --> 03:03:07.500]  old Native American wizard coming over and breathing his horrible breath in the
[03:03:07.500 --> 03:03:11.560]  kids face and beating a drum that was loving and good so the New York Times
[03:03:11.560 --> 03:03:15.400]  and others have decided that actually it's a wonderful thing kind of like
[03:03:15.400 --> 03:03:19.800]  their board member that said whites are subhuman goblins that live in holes on
[03:03:19.800 --> 03:03:23.120]  the ground and she can't wait till we're all exterminated at first they said oh
[03:03:23.120 --> 03:03:28.560]  yeah this is wrong and they said you know what it's free speech but as long as
[03:03:28.560 --> 03:03:32.240]  an Asian or a black person or somebody's talking like a Nazi it's okay
[03:03:32.240 --> 03:03:38.240]  because again they can't be racist they are the anointed God people unbelievable

[03:07:12.920 --> 03:07:18.760]  moment to get used to probes and censorship so he would adapt to censorship by just putting up with it

[03:11:11.560 --> 03:11:16.760]  you know now they're producing some of their own programs and so the lawyers then contacted them
[03:11:16.760 --> 03:11:21.240]  and bragged in the washington post that they told him he's currently viciously attacking us
[03:11:21.240 --> 03:11:26.520]  he's currently sending people to our houses help us well that's not a free speech issue that's
[03:11:26.520 --> 03:11:31.400]  like saying a local radio host is telling people go rob the bank it's no longer free speech you're
[03:11:31.400 --> 03:11:37.560]  now calling for criminal action didn't do it but see they're doing it through my name and my voice
[03:11:39.880 --> 03:11:44.680]  notice the news never shows you where i did that so now they have these groups looking like the
[03:11:44.680 --> 03:11:51.480]  grassroots organizations contacting our affiliates saying did you know he's currently saying go do
[03:11:51.480 --> 03:11:57.880]  this and that things i never did so it's a false report it's it's it's it's the definition of
[03:11:57.880 --> 03:12:04.520]  defamation to cause harm they are saying things that aren't true and saying it's to get me off the air
[03:12:05.080 --> 03:12:10.200]  so that the lawyers just take morning uh just say afternoon talk something i want to do but
[03:12:10.200 --> 03:12:14.680]  obviously i'm gonna have to take action because imagine if someone was filing reports that you
[03:12:14.680 --> 03:12:19.000]  were doing something you weren't and you reached out to them and you you shot all these videos and
[03:12:19.000 --> 03:12:25.240]  reports and their responses to complain to youtube to have your videos taken down where you clarify
[03:12:28.360 --> 03:12:34.520]  so that's what this is and they're not going to stop so i absolutely need your prayers i need your
[03:12:34.520 --> 03:12:40.200]  support i need your financial support because if they're able to shut us down this is the model
[03:12:40.200 --> 03:12:47.560]  for everybody else so we really are a americana example that is on the front lines and without
[03:12:47.560 --> 03:12:53.480]  you we will be defeated and we got some big guests coming up today we have the lawyer for the covington
[03:12:53.480 --> 03:13:01.160]  catholic school kids joining us coming up just a couple segments we all show he's about to file
[03:13:01.160 --> 03:13:06.760]  a bunch of lawsuits which absolutely need to be done this is clear go to their houses go to their
[03:13:06.760 --> 03:13:10.760]  schools kill them shoot them murder them the people don't even take this off twitter in fact
[03:13:10.760 --> 03:13:16.440]  they're doubling down the new york times is defending the black racist group that was their
[03:13:16.440 --> 03:13:20.200]  screaming racist names that have been saying it's a good thing they did uh just like the new york
[03:13:20.200 --> 03:13:26.520]  times board member says whites are subhuman so you cannot make this up so that's all coming up
[03:13:26.520 --> 03:13:31.640]  and we have a bunch of other big guests as well we have this big hollywood case of men being raped
[03:13:32.600 --> 03:13:37.800]  men being abused boys being abused and famous hollywood individuals saying no one will believe
[03:13:37.800 --> 03:13:42.440]  you that's now mainstream news and we've got one of the investigative journalists and filmmakers
[03:13:42.440 --> 03:13:48.760]  who's been working with the writers the story to expose it coming on will be naming names of confirmed
[03:13:48.760 --> 03:13:55.400]  admitted pedophilia rings rape you name it that is now starting to come out about hollywood so
[03:13:55.400 --> 03:13:59.720]  that's why they want to shut us off air but it's not going to work that transmission will be going
[03:13:59.720 --> 03:14:08.200]  out uh with Gabe Hoffman and robert barnes the lawyer for many of the uh kentucky catholic

[03:14:14.200 --> 03:14:20.440]  as well but just briefly going back to what i just mentioned if you're a tv viewer you can see this
[03:14:20.440 --> 03:14:26.040]  here's anculture a few days ago journalists in 2018 alex jones caused the families of
[03:14:26.040 --> 03:14:31.800]  sandhude victims to be harassed he must be banned from all social media well they actually say i'm
[03:14:31.800 --> 03:14:39.960]  currently doing it okay even though that's not true and the prior isn't true then journalists in 2019
[03:14:39.960 --> 03:14:47.240]  please kill these children and their families they're then kept on the internet that shows the
[03:14:47.240 --> 03:14:53.240]  leftist disconnect and we have an example of this uh one of these hollywood individuals that will
[03:14:53.240 --> 03:14:58.600]  cover at the bottom of the hour the lawyer came out and made vile hateful statements towards the
[03:14:58.600 --> 03:15:05.320]  kids and hasn't retracted in fact he's doubled down as of this morning so we're going to play
[03:15:05.320 --> 03:15:10.920]  the shocking video from his twitter account tell you who he is the article is up on m4s.com he is a
[03:15:11.800 --> 03:15:16.040]  monstrous monstrous monstrous individual that we're going to be breaking down at the bottom of the
[03:15:16.040 --> 03:15:26.040]  hour uh with the lawyer also turns out that uh the uh elder nathan philips did say he was in
[03:15:26.040 --> 03:15:31.080]  combat vietnam so he is a complete liar we have video of that again kathy griffin has
[03:15:31.080 --> 03:15:35.720]  backed down and removed her tweet saying go attack him at their school but not hollywood bully

[03:19:42.360 --> 03:19:47.560]  built i want to go to the next level i want to be with the spirit that i've experienced not these
[03:19:47.560 --> 03:19:53.160]  devil worshipers they're cold and failed and feels like being a tomb i want life i want jesus
[03:19:53.160 --> 03:20:10.120]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:20:16.120 --> 03:20:18.120]  alex jones here back live
[03:20:18.120 --> 03:20:27.240]  one guayado according to many international polling experts and witnesses won the last election
[03:20:28.120 --> 03:20:32.200]  even though they didn't even allow them to be on the ballot many areas in venezuela
[03:20:33.080 --> 03:20:37.880]  there has been a one-party dictatorship at first said it was liberal then said it was socialist
[03:20:37.880 --> 03:20:47.400]  then said it was communist and you've got maduro who is just a complete moron and extremely unpopular
[03:20:47.400 --> 03:20:51.880]  to say which one about hugo chavez he was very charismatic and had a very big following and
[03:20:51.880 --> 03:20:58.440]  he did originally get elected legitimately but with maduro these have been fake elections and
[03:20:58.440 --> 03:21:02.200]  up to a thousand people a week starving to death they passed a loft years ago you can't
[03:21:02.200 --> 03:21:07.480]  say people are starving to death they just say you die of exposure or die of the flu or die of
[03:21:07.480 --> 03:21:13.640]  something else five years ago all the zoos had their animals eaten around that same time all
[03:21:13.640 --> 03:21:18.680]  the cats and dogs disappeared now birds have disappeared insects are disappearing there's
[03:21:18.680 --> 03:21:23.320]  total collapse of society because communists shit on top of all the crops and all the fields
[03:21:24.120 --> 03:21:29.880]  and then give the people none of what they produce when they do the communists always
[03:21:29.880 --> 03:21:37.080]  shell it to foreign groups to make money because the communists all build lavish palaces in spain
[03:21:37.080 --> 03:21:44.200]  and in switzerland and in morocco and other areas like that that's just what they do
[03:21:44.200 --> 03:21:50.120]  australia i mean there's a lot of places they run to the united states and so this is a total
[03:21:50.120 --> 03:22:00.200]  corruption there have been cases of people hijacking trailers full of cows full of beef
[03:22:00.200 --> 03:22:05.080]  and just slaughtering them right there with machetes and just like zombies gobbling the meat
[03:22:05.080 --> 03:22:10.360]  that's what happens when you're starving to death and so if you're a tv viewer you can
[03:22:10.360 --> 03:22:16.040]  see the images of state-run media set a half million it looked like millions of people
[03:22:17.000 --> 03:22:23.320]  flooding all the major streets of caracas and we can also roll some of the video of people
[03:22:23.320 --> 03:22:30.600]  being shot armored vehicles being hit by malloff cocktails this is truly a historic situation
[03:22:30.600 --> 03:22:37.640]  taking place this looks like scenes out of the hunger games armored vehicles
[03:22:39.880 --> 03:22:44.760]  citizens throwing rocks at the armored vehicles malloff cocktails the police and military shooting
[03:22:44.760 --> 03:22:51.080]  people hundreds and hundreds wounded we're hearing numbers of seven dead that's government run
[03:22:51.080 --> 03:22:55.480]  media means probably 500 i mean who knows you never know with these communist countries
[03:22:55.480 --> 03:23:02.040]  and so yes i don't like american expansionism where we go take over afghanistan for the tune
[03:23:02.040 --> 03:23:06.680]  of a trillion plus dollars it's been more than that's been two trillion it's been a hundred
[03:23:06.680 --> 03:23:13.160]  million a year for 18 years so approaching two trillion and then we don't even get any of the
[03:23:13.160 --> 03:23:19.080]  rare earth minerals zero and china gets small we guard the roads and facilities for china to get
[03:23:19.080 --> 03:23:24.120]  the rare earth minerals to build the smartphones and computers look if we're going to be imperial
[03:23:24.120 --> 03:23:29.240]  we get all of it and i'm not even for that that's immoral but we get it all
[03:23:30.680 --> 03:23:34.920]  let's see global corporations like apple and others they are based in china now
[03:23:35.720 --> 03:23:40.760]  officially based in ireland but they're based over there in china pays european tax and then
[03:23:40.760 --> 03:23:47.880]  we go pay for all this so so china and russia have come out and decried and say the us is meddling
[03:23:47.880 --> 03:23:53.720]  in venezuela let me tell you something it's a national security issue but venezuela is seven
[03:23:53.720 --> 03:24:04.680]  countries from us they're in north eastern south america and they're only what 700 800 miles away
[03:24:04.680 --> 03:24:09.480]  from us with a bunch of little bitty countries in between them and they've collapsed brazil and others
[03:24:09.480 --> 03:24:14.200]  all built fences and put their militaries on them the last couple years because it's collapsing and
[03:24:14.200 --> 03:24:20.760]  the very worst of venezuela are coming into their nations but don't worry now it's coming here
[03:24:20.760 --> 03:24:27.080]  and you saw the images months ago of the gates being broken down in guatemala into southern mexico
[03:24:27.080 --> 03:24:35.320]  and now mexico just said hey you orderly process yourselves we will issue you visas for one month
[03:24:35.320 --> 03:24:39.880]  to travel through mexico and if we catch you after that you'll be sent back or put in prison
[03:24:39.880 --> 03:24:44.680]  they're very strict immigration laws obviously in mexico they should as bad as mexico is latin
[03:24:44.680 --> 03:24:51.800]  america central america is even worse now i mean we're talking hellish and so now mexico
[03:24:51.800 --> 03:24:59.800]  is organizing with the un to flood us just like turkey did in the last six years and just like
[03:24:59.800 --> 03:25:07.400]  albania did to flood europe so it is it is diabolical to say the least it is coordinated it is extremely
[03:25:07.400 --> 03:25:16.040]  evil and it's only getting worse so i hope that maduro is thrown out i hope that a popular
[03:25:16.040 --> 03:25:24.680]  conservative nationalist gets in venezuela per capita for a country their size has more resources
[03:25:24.680 --> 03:25:39.000]  than any country in the world oil cold diamonds gold silver timber volcanic farmland and in the
[03:25:39.000 --> 03:25:44.840]  past hardworking good people but they got on the dole they got into socialism they got told oh
[03:25:44.840 --> 03:25:51.240]  that rich coffee plantation owner or that banana plantation owner you could have that you could
[03:25:51.240 --> 03:25:56.600]  have that and then they vote to take it and then there's nothing left because the communist leaders
[03:25:57.320 --> 03:26:00.760]  don't sit there and shut it on the open market they sell it at reduced prices
[03:26:01.320 --> 03:26:06.280]  to multinationals and that's why the globalists love communist and socialist countries because
[03:26:06.280 --> 03:26:13.800]  they collapse crustic prosperity and capitalism creates a lot of money people start having five
[03:26:13.800 --> 03:26:23.640]  six kids and the kids go to a social school they vote in hugo chavez and 15 years later the country
[03:26:23.640 --> 03:26:29.240]  is one of the poorest in the world it was the richest country in latin america richer than the
[03:26:29.240 --> 03:26:37.080]  united states the average citizen in 1950 was paid more and had more savings and owned more land
[03:26:37.080 --> 03:26:47.640]  than the average american in 1950 and now it is a total hellhole that's the story of socialism so
[03:26:47.640 --> 03:26:52.360]  remember that when you see alexandria cortege bumbling around like a methhead moron whatever
[03:26:52.360 --> 03:26:57.800]  the hell she's on remember that that she's sitting there telling a bunch of stupid people hey you're
[03:26:57.800 --> 03:27:01.160]  going to get all this free stuff and the big bankers are funding that because they're going to sit
[03:27:01.160 --> 03:27:07.720]  offshore when america gets totally looted also coming up world war three cometh syria is threatening
[03:27:07.720 --> 03:27:11.640]  to bomb the airport in tel Aviv and iran is pledging to wipe israel off the map that's why
[03:27:11.640 --> 03:27:16.520]  we pulled out michael snyder's article from into the american dream upon enforce dot com is excellent
[03:27:16.520 --> 03:27:21.000]  we'll be looking at that but first the lawyer for the covington catholic school
[03:27:24.200 --> 03:27:28.040]  young people framed by the globalist is joining us please do not forget
[03:27:28.040 --> 03:27:33.960]  that everybody needs supplements especially for your children we have the best tumoring

[03:34:11.640 --> 03:34:15.720]  on something i said saturday and sunday would become a major c change event if people got the
[03:34:15.720 --> 03:34:21.640]  truth out that the mainstream corporate media with a bunch of leftist operatives would try to march
[03:34:21.640 --> 03:34:28.280]  into a group of catholic school boys and others trying to get on a bus and say that they surrounded
[03:34:28.280 --> 03:34:33.000]  them and they said racist things when it's on the audio that the mainstream news didn't show that was
[03:34:33.000 --> 03:34:38.040]  the first thing get out of here white boy go back to europe we're going to harvest your organs you're
[03:34:38.040 --> 03:34:43.400]  a fag your you know your parents or brothers and sisters your prods your your your incest
[03:34:45.640 --> 03:34:49.960]  i i wouldn't found the raw video and heard that and then i went wait a minute and then
[03:34:49.960 --> 03:34:56.920]  there it was our news director pointed out on saturday rob do that they marched over to them
[03:34:59.160 --> 03:35:05.160]  this so-called native american elder and the black israelites but the reason this is so important
[03:35:05.160 --> 03:35:11.320]  is even after the lawyer that step four representing some of these great young men
[03:35:12.200 --> 03:35:16.360]  warned people to back off and gave them a chance to stop the defamation
[03:35:16.360 --> 03:35:22.600]  and i looked this morning for like an hour and i was fascinated they're still publishing editorials
[03:35:22.600 --> 03:35:27.720]  about the hate and how the boys represent that because of their hats and how they're
[03:35:27.720 --> 03:35:33.880]  nazis and hollywood bully viciously attacks covington students in profanity pedophilia
[03:35:33.880 --> 03:35:39.800]  laced rant and that horrible creatures michael rapaport that slide about me as well and then
[03:35:39.800 --> 03:35:46.120]  meanwhile this guy still has it up on his twitter a well-known musician verified left his calls for
[03:35:46.120 --> 03:35:52.200]  make america great again kids to be fired on school to be burned down tatalie grippin said doxxum
[03:35:52.200 --> 03:35:58.200]  go get them and they did and cultur asked the question journalists in 2018 said alex jones
[03:35:58.200 --> 03:36:02.680]  caused the families of sandy hook victims to be harassed never did he must be banned from all
[03:36:02.680 --> 03:36:08.200]  social media journalists 2019 please kill these children and their families we got and coming
[03:36:08.200 --> 03:36:14.040]  on very soon so again the left always accuses me of saying doing things i didn't do and then they
[03:36:14.040 --> 03:36:20.200]  say that i'm currently sending people like a wolf at the door uh try to hurt people that's not true
[03:36:20.200 --> 03:36:25.800]  but then they do it as a matter of course on twitter and facebook and everywhere else we all know
[03:36:25.800 --> 03:36:30.760]  about that maxine water sand that they're at the gas station they're at the mall they're at the grocery
[03:36:30.760 --> 03:36:36.600]  store you run their ass out of there and you know what i've experienced it they'll walk over and dump
[03:36:36.600 --> 03:36:39.960]  hot coffee on your head they'll knock your xt over right in front of your kids they don't care
[03:36:39.960 --> 03:36:44.120]  meanwhile new york times runs defense for black anti-semite hate group
[03:36:46.520 --> 03:36:50.520]  the very group saying they'd harvest the organs of these kids so this is really
[03:36:50.520 --> 03:36:55.080]  capture everybody's imagination because you've still got the new islamic member of congress
[03:36:55.800 --> 03:37:02.840]  days after this has proven to be a hoax ihan omar saying that they were nazis and all this other
[03:37:02.840 --> 03:37:07.800]  lies turns out that nathan philips is an even bigger fraud was never in vietnam never in combat
[03:37:07.800 --> 03:37:12.440]  well surprise surprise he's a professional agitator but at least kathy griffin at least
[03:37:12.440 --> 03:37:17.400]  deleted her tweet saying docks him and go after these nazis which they aren't i want to play this
[03:37:17.400 --> 03:37:22.120]  clip and then go to their lawyer robert barnes we really appreciate joining us thank god somebody

[03:37:31.160 --> 03:37:35.480]  none of it's true and then a lot of the corporate media still won't back off they act like well

[03:39:54.920 --> 03:40:00.280]  doubled down others have left it up and so we appreciate him joining us at barns underscore
[03:40:00.280 --> 03:40:06.040]  law barnslawllp.com counselor thanks for joining us and thanks for standing up to real bullies
[03:40:07.400 --> 03:40:12.200]  glad to be here i mean it's uh it's extraordinary what's taking place i represented people across
[03:40:12.200 --> 03:40:18.440]  the political spectrum from uh joe banister and verney kuglen to wesley snipes and ralph nader
[03:40:18.440 --> 03:40:22.600]  but this may end up being one of the most consequential cases i'm ever a part of
[03:40:22.600 --> 03:40:27.960]  because this is about the rights of ordinary people private citizens in this case kids being able to
[03:40:27.960 --> 03:40:33.080]  protect their privacy being able to protect their rights who almost had their reputations
[03:40:33.080 --> 03:40:39.080]  permanently ruined their their careers and their potential aspirations permanently tarnished solely
[03:40:39.080 --> 03:40:44.840]  because of a lie and a libel spread by the establishment press based on kids they had never
[03:40:44.840 --> 03:40:51.320]  met a story that they didn't personally witness built on a fabricated stories by lefty protesters
[03:40:51.320 --> 03:40:56.360]  who spread it through bots on the internet so it's an extraordinary case and the reason why i
[03:40:56.360 --> 03:41:01.720]  offered my services for free is because typically as you know out so libel cases can be very expensive
[03:41:01.720 --> 03:41:07.640]  very difficult to defend very difficult to bring uh and normally big powerful establishment press
[03:41:07.640 --> 03:41:12.360]  people get away with it all the time uh so because they know the ordinary person has no remedy they
[03:41:12.360 --> 03:41:16.360]  know they sue people like you it makes it very difficult for you to defend yourself so it's
[03:41:16.360 --> 03:41:21.560]  what the it's a tool they use it's a form of lawfare and i offered my services for free because
[03:41:21.560 --> 03:41:26.520]  i wanted to equalize the equation because everybody deserves the same rights to be respected
[03:41:26.520 --> 03:41:30.920]  and their rights were not respected in this case by the way a bunch of stuff just clicked you know
[03:41:30.920 --> 03:41:34.120]  i'm involved in in a bunch of things they're trying to end the first amendment literally using me
[03:41:34.120 --> 03:41:37.720]  they admit that i know you were Wesley Snipes lawyer i know you're and i even thought about trying to
[03:41:37.720 --> 03:41:41.880]  get a hold of you and they didn't do it so maybe this is meant to happen too for us to talk about
[03:41:41.880 --> 03:41:45.720]  some other things because i was i was actually thinking you in mind for the sigh up and trying
[03:41:45.720 --> 03:41:49.960]  to run against me because you're so articulate to break it down but but i think you're saying
[03:41:49.960 --> 03:41:54.440]  this is the moment they bit off more than they could chew they really did because these are
[03:41:54.440 --> 03:41:59.320]  private kids these are private citizens uh so not only do they spread something that was a clear
[03:41:59.320 --> 03:42:05.000]  lie that was an easy to prove lie uh they they did it in such a way that everybody was outraged
[03:42:05.000 --> 03:42:09.240]  that everybody found just incredible and they went they took it a step further i mean they
[03:42:09.240 --> 03:42:13.640]  were threatening to burn down the school my law offices within three hours of me announcing that
[03:42:13.640 --> 03:42:17.480]  i was representing them was subject to bomb threats that are now currently under fb of
[03:42:17.480 --> 03:42:22.360]  investigation they tried to hack every social media account that i had they they've gone after the
[03:42:22.360 --> 03:42:27.240]  family the diocese has had to close down three different times because of suspicious packages
[03:42:27.240 --> 03:42:32.760]  that showed up at their doors you have lunatics like michael rapaport like ron perlman making absurd
[03:42:32.760 --> 03:42:38.280]  threats now i'll give a congresswoman omar and kathy griffin credit that at least when they libeled
[03:42:38.280 --> 03:42:43.640]  them in line about these kids and i sent tweets to them saying retract or be sued they at least had
[03:42:43.640 --> 03:42:48.520]  the proper action of at least retract stay there let's talk about this this is amazing robert barnes

[03:46:06.520 --> 03:46:10.840]  the first amendment the bill of rights the rest of the bill of rights are prohibitions
[03:46:10.840 --> 03:46:17.320]  they're prohibitions against powerful organizations and individuals taking those god-given rights from
[03:46:17.320 --> 03:46:20.920]  us as individuals you better understand that because they're taking them right now
[03:46:24.200 --> 03:46:29.880]  we have seen what they want to do they called it unagent 21 now they call it the un 2030 agenda
[03:46:29.880 --> 03:46:35.320]  they want everybody off of the rural lands they want people out of the suburbs they want to pack
[03:46:35.320 --> 03:46:41.800]  everybody into the cities because that's where it is easiest for them to control everyone it's
[03:46:41.800 --> 03:46:51.400]  the david night show never missed your show any day i mean i mean never edit fours dot com

[03:47:07.320 --> 03:47:17.240]  so
[03:47:22.680 --> 03:47:31.000]  you can listen to the engine morning out is one long song you can think about the woman
[03:47:31.000 --> 03:47:38.920]  or the girl you knew the night before think about it
[03:47:40.600 --> 03:47:46.920]  buddy your thoughts will soon be one we've got a clear cut example here of corporate media
[03:47:48.280 --> 03:47:52.760]  seeing a bunch of school kids some of them were to make america a great again hats
[03:47:52.760 --> 03:47:58.440]  were there for a pro-life march and within 30 minutes we went and found the raw footage from
[03:47:58.440 --> 03:48:02.760]  the god channel going after you white people it's a little black kids who are part of the school after
[03:48:02.760 --> 03:48:08.360]  you are going to harvest your organs kid you're going to die your mother and your father or brother
[03:48:08.360 --> 03:48:15.560]  and sisters you're you're you're going to shoot your school up and then the media takes that edits
[03:48:15.560 --> 03:48:20.040]  it and the very same groups have done that to me in dc as well they've done the same stuff to us
[03:48:20.680 --> 03:48:23.640]  but they come over to y'all and scream at you and then they sit back and go why are you doing this
[03:48:23.640 --> 03:48:29.560]  to me because they're editing the tapes so you have the premeditatedness of this and i said day
[03:48:29.560 --> 03:48:34.840]  one i said i'd bet this individual this so-called native elder i think it's got a long history
[03:48:34.840 --> 03:48:39.000]  of democratic party provocaturing apparently he's not even doing it for a decade that same
[03:48:39.000 --> 03:48:43.480]  day he went to catholic church with 20 people at mass beating drums trying to get his ass kicked
[03:48:43.480 --> 03:48:49.160]  he goes to colleges on halloween this is on record in local news channels all of the country
[03:48:49.160 --> 03:48:55.240]  he's done in colorado he's done it in michigan he does it all over and he shows up beating a
[03:48:55.240 --> 03:49:00.040]  drum getting in people's faces saying you can't dress like a native american trying to get his
[03:49:00.040 --> 03:49:06.280]  butt kicked but no one's ever taken the bait but you know what he's never given up robert barnes is
[03:49:06.280 --> 03:49:11.560]  again one of the top lawyers in the country when it comes to this he's taking it pro bono he's
[03:49:11.560 --> 03:49:15.880]  represented you know major hollywood stars and cases where they spent millions defending themselves
[03:49:15.880 --> 03:49:20.200]  some cases winning some cases losing everybody knows about the wesley snipes case but the point is
[03:49:20.200 --> 03:49:26.120]  he's taking this pro bono because he says it's so clear cut so lay out what you think really
[03:49:26.120 --> 03:49:32.040]  happened here where it's going the 48 hours you've given them again some groups are backing off but
[03:49:32.040 --> 03:49:38.360]  then republishing new lies like the new york times is done so uh who do you think who are you zeroing
[03:49:38.360 --> 03:49:44.680]  in on or i guess that's kind of inside baseball we definitely raise is going to get sued the one
[03:49:44.680 --> 03:49:50.680]  who said that the that the kids should be punched in the face uh the former cnn uh commentator who
[03:49:50.680 --> 03:49:56.440]  now has a big social media platform uh maggie haberman uh has yet to correct her statements where
[03:49:56.440 --> 03:50:00.760]  she basically called for the expulsion of these kids and here you have the lead reporter for the
[03:50:00.760 --> 03:50:05.400]  lead newspaper in the nation making a false report about kids you never met in a story she
[03:50:05.400 --> 03:50:10.680]  didn't witness uh for facts you didn't have no first hand first hand which your own newspaper
[03:50:10.680 --> 03:50:15.400]  has corrected and yet she has refused to delete or correct her own statements in this regard
[03:50:16.120 --> 03:50:21.720]  and then michael rapapour uh and ron perlman on the on the hollywood side of the equation and then
[03:50:21.720 --> 03:50:26.200]  a range of editors uh including the editor of mother jones who has issued false statements about
[03:50:26.200 --> 03:50:30.600]  this it was completely disgrace the independent investigative history of that publication with
[03:50:30.600 --> 03:50:35.560]  her partisan political nonsense over the past year and a half acting as basically a speaking
[03:50:35.560 --> 03:50:40.840]  platform for fusion gps and the russia gate scandal so you have a range of people and there's about
[03:50:40.840 --> 03:50:45.480]  about a half dozen other prominent uh people either in the journalistic world the celebrity world
[03:50:45.480 --> 03:50:50.440]  of the social media world who have continued to lie about these kids libel these kids and i think
[03:50:50.440 --> 03:50:55.560]  they don't understand kentucky law kentucky law says that you can't put kids uh or any other
[03:50:55.560 --> 03:51:01.000]  individual citizen of kentucky in an unflattering unreasonable light uh you can't that's called
[03:51:01.000 --> 03:51:06.920]  false invasion that's called uh basically invasion of privacy claim and it's broader than defamation
[03:51:06.920 --> 03:51:11.800]  claims broader than libel claims and you can even seek per se damages uh which means all you have
[03:51:11.800 --> 03:51:17.320]  to do is show that the lie was somehow outrageous of these private citizens uh that they are entitled
[03:51:17.320 --> 03:51:21.240]  to damages without having to prove individual damage sure i'm not a lawyer but i mean this
[03:51:21.240 --> 03:51:26.120]  is really a conspiracy almost like racketeering where all these media groups get together they
[03:51:26.120 --> 03:51:30.280]  know it's a lie they all put it out then when they get caught they kind of halfway back off it's
[03:51:30.280 --> 03:51:37.320]  okay well where the kids right to confront him and then then they say okay we were wrong but oh uh
[03:51:37.320 --> 03:51:42.360]  you know the kids still ask for it i mean it's just crazy that that that people like michael
[03:51:42.360 --> 03:51:47.000]  rapaport are not backing down he's still got his video up he's still making jokes i don't think he
[03:51:47.000 --> 03:51:52.120]  gets it i know i agree i think he's completely out of touch and i think what it is is they're so
[03:51:52.120 --> 03:51:56.760]  accustomed to beating up on people they're used to attacking public figures of a different kind
[03:51:56.760 --> 03:52:00.760]  they're used to doing it in such a way that uh that they're never sued they're never successfully
[03:52:00.760 --> 03:52:04.920]  sued they suffer no consequence the wall street journal even had an editorial on this that said
[03:52:04.920 --> 03:52:08.840]  all these people that lied about these kids will probably face no consequence and that was the
[03:52:08.840 --> 03:52:13.160]  reason why we try to step into the breach here because these people need to suffer a consequence
[03:52:13.160 --> 03:52:17.720]  they need to realize that just because they have the power of the press and the privilege of the
[03:52:17.720 --> 03:52:23.320]  press they do not have immunity when they lie about innocent kids uh who they don't know whose
[03:52:23.320 --> 03:52:27.640]  incidents they didn't witness for which they had no evidence to support their false claims for which
[03:52:27.640 --> 03:52:32.200]  they knew were false claims within a day of their reporting when they refused to retract uh the
[03:52:32.200 --> 03:52:37.800]  family is a very you know conservative uh catholic families and they authorized me to offer a 48-hour
[03:52:38.520 --> 03:52:43.320]  notice to everybody that as long as they corrected retracted or deleted their wrongful statements
[03:52:43.320 --> 03:52:46.920]  that they wouldn't sue those people they're not looking to sue they don't want to sue they don't
[03:52:46.920 --> 03:52:51.160]  want to jump into court they're not litigious people they just don't want this to happen to any
[03:52:51.160 --> 03:52:56.520]  other kids like the hell they've been through over the last week and uh and so thus everybody's on
[03:52:56.520 --> 03:53:01.400]  notice that it's they have until the end of business uh midnight friday to be able to to retract
[03:53:01.400 --> 03:53:05.400]  their statements and if they don't they don't correct they don't apologize they don't remedy
[03:53:05.400 --> 03:53:10.280]  they're going to be sued and they're going to be sued on an individual basis uh so the it's not
[03:53:10.280 --> 03:53:14.680]  there we won't be targeting institutions as much as individuals because that will educate them I
[03:53:14.680 --> 03:53:19.320]  think a little bit better that just because you have a powerful institution behind you
[03:53:19.320 --> 03:53:23.720]  that doesn't give you immunity to go out there and lie about kids libel kids and bathe their
[03:53:23.720 --> 03:53:28.600]  privacy try to ruin their reputations try to get them expelled try to deny their admissions to
[03:53:28.600 --> 03:53:33.320]  college to try to encourage and incentivize violence against them just because you don't
[03:53:33.320 --> 03:53:38.200]  like the hat they wear the color of their skin or their gender can I add one more point counselor
[03:53:38.200 --> 03:53:43.400]  I know you're the expert on this but they also have to because the the major meeting is stolen
[03:53:43.400 --> 03:53:48.440]  their identity I mean as I said I typed in their names this morning I just typed in covington
[03:53:48.440 --> 03:53:54.680]  covington students and I saw north carolina colorada california op eds that were out today
[03:53:54.680 --> 03:53:59.800]  saying the covington kids this is just with one search term there was literally dozens which is
[03:53:59.800 --> 03:54:05.240]  covington kids they you know they show the dark side of racism of kentucky their articles in
[03:54:05.240 --> 03:54:10.040]  kentucky about the shame of kentucky and our racism and then showing pictures of these poor
[03:54:10.040 --> 03:54:16.520]  kids they're still doing it and then 10 paragraphs down they would mention well there's some contention
[03:54:16.520 --> 03:54:21.320]  about what happened but it's still the racism of these evil white kids confronting this poor
[03:54:21.320 --> 03:54:26.040]  native american so they're still doing it and that's why I think they have to sue that's why
[03:54:26.040 --> 03:54:29.960]  I'm gearing up to countersue other people that are lying about what I've said you know they sue me
[03:54:29.960 --> 03:54:34.040]  they lie about what I've said and and then they so it's a very complex issue but with this it's
[03:54:34.040 --> 03:54:39.880]  so cut and dry so I'm trying to quantify that don't they have to sue to make sure people don't double
[03:54:39.880 --> 03:54:44.840]  back and keep lying absolutely I mean the way that the approach to the family was anybody
[03:54:44.840 --> 03:54:49.880]  could get redemption through confession if they retracted their false statements but if they double
[03:54:49.880 --> 03:54:54.600]  down as you noted many have then those people need punishment and need deterrence through
[03:54:54.600 --> 03:54:59.320]  punishment and that needs to be lawfare and for the last decade or so in particular the last
[03:54:59.320 --> 03:55:05.080]  several years lawfare has been waged solely by the left against everybody else to try to censor
[03:55:05.080 --> 03:55:10.360]  and shame dissident opinions and dissident powerful voices like yourself and it's time that we fight
[03:55:10.360 --> 03:55:15.560]  back on those same terms and fight back using lawfare on behalf of the independent ordinary
[03:55:15.560 --> 03:55:20.360]  everyday people an independent journalist an independent voices out there so this can't happen
[03:55:20.360 --> 03:55:25.240]  to ordinary people because that was the message here the message was here was if we could destroy
[03:55:25.240 --> 03:55:31.080]  the lives of some 16 year old kids in covington kentucky guess what we could do to you and that's
[03:55:31.080 --> 03:55:35.240]  why the message needs to be if you think you can lie and libel about them because you happen to
[03:55:35.240 --> 03:55:39.240]  write for the new york times we'll guess again because you're going to hear from a kentucky
[03:55:39.240 --> 03:55:44.280]  jury about how that's gonna work well i was about to say it sounds to me like they've been using
[03:55:44.280 --> 03:55:49.240]  lawfare in a bunch of fake cases they use the publication of these suits we're almost all of
[03:55:49.240 --> 03:55:53.640]  it's something i never did no one ever did but they just use that like well it must be true it's in
[03:55:53.640 --> 03:55:59.400]  a lawsuit but now we've got the whole bona fides of the setup the frame up the media knew they
[03:55:59.400 --> 03:56:03.880]  doubled down i mean it just seems like like you said open and shut because what they say
[03:56:03.880 --> 03:56:09.400]  a nationalist and christians and conservatives and libertarians are doing is what the left everybody
[03:56:09.400 --> 03:56:13.320]  knows the left for the bullies everybody knows they're the ones brigading around on the internet
[03:56:13.320 --> 03:56:18.600]  bullying everybody and so now they they've they've set it up where uh you know even questioning
[03:56:18.600 --> 03:56:23.400]  something supposedly you know unlawful or or uncivil well now they've done the very definition
[03:56:23.400 --> 03:56:29.480]  of what they've projected on us that's precisely right i mean they've used the law in illegitimate
[03:56:29.480 --> 03:56:35.960]  and illicit ways to wage political warfare using bogus claims and using their unique access to the
[03:56:35.960 --> 03:56:40.440]  legal system the fact that the judiciary is overwhelmingly establishment and to the left
[03:56:40.440 --> 03:56:46.360]  the legal profession as a class is overwhelmingly to the cultural left and pro establishment
[03:56:46.360 --> 03:56:50.920]  in general and so it's time to sort of equalize the playing field and the advantage here is
[03:56:50.920 --> 03:56:57.240]  actually the actual law and the actual facts are on the side of the family on the side of the kids
[03:56:57.240 --> 03:57:01.080]  and often they've been on the side of those independent voices throughout the political
[03:57:01.080 --> 03:57:05.240]  right that have now been subject or independent period have that have been subject to these
[03:57:05.240 --> 03:57:09.080]  threats i mean i started doing this uh representation in the ballot access and
[03:57:09.080 --> 03:57:14.520]  petition circulator context for voices like ralph nader libertarians constitutionalist
[03:57:14.520 --> 03:57:18.840]  tea party folks a peace and freedom party everybody across the ideologically whoever's
[03:57:18.840 --> 03:57:23.160]  persecuted you've been doing that for decades exactly so that was where they originally started
[03:57:23.160 --> 03:57:28.120]  political warfare and law legal warfare was using ballot access using your ability to access
[03:57:28.120 --> 03:57:33.400]  candidacies your ability to circulate petitions now they've shifted it to legal warfare to
[03:57:33.400 --> 03:57:39.320]  defame people to libel people robert you're on fire robert barnes uh the lawyer for the covington
[03:57:39.320 --> 03:57:48.760]  children we're right back stay with us when it comes to rebuilding your energy convenience is key
