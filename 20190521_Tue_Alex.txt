[00:00:09.093 --> 00:00:14.998]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[00:00:37.268 --> 00:00:41.010]  It's Tuesday, May 21st, 2019.
[00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.590]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.032]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:00:46.032 --> 00:00:54.636]  You can see the terrifying headline atop The Drugs Report right now.
[00:00:54.636 --> 00:00:56.497]  Gallup.
[00:00:56.497 --> 00:01:00.659]  Four in ten Americans embrace socialism.
[00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:05.821]  Now, even though Gallup famously skews towards the left in who and where they sample,
[00:01:07.972 --> 00:01:16.376]  The numbers are pretty clear on college campuses that half of the students want something for free.
[00:01:16.376 --> 00:01:26.600]  And we've now seen the main lining of free education, free health care, free housing, free money, reparations, free sex changes.
[00:01:28.407 --> 00:01:38.890]  Pushed and the idea is out there and more and more millennials don't want to aspire to ever get married or ever have children or even ever have a car.
[00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.112]  No, they just want to play video games and virtue signal.
[00:01:43.112 --> 00:01:49.174]  That's actually what they say in surveys and they look down on people who want to be successful and produce.
[00:01:50.555 --> 00:01:58.898]  But more importantly, they lick their lips like a wolf or a coyote looks at a fat, juicy sheep.
[00:01:58.898 --> 00:02:10.961]  Because even though they resemble obese, lobotomized sheep on the left, they've still trained us to submit to them or be bullied by the corporate media.
[00:02:10.961 --> 00:02:13.882]  But it's all a total illusion.
[00:02:13.882 --> 00:02:15.723]  So what if you get bullied by the corporate media?
[00:02:16.733 --> 00:02:24.342]  Only folks like Trump or myself have enjoyed the full wrath of the establishment, and that's not the low-level
[00:02:25.686 --> 00:02:27.647]  Chicken net leftist.
[00:02:27.647 --> 00:02:28.847]  That's the big mega banks.
[00:02:28.847 --> 00:02:30.128]  That's the big billionaires.
[00:02:30.128 --> 00:02:43.112]  That's the big monopoly men combines that don't want anybody out here trying to organize humanity into an effective system to move forward and build prosperous successful societies.
[00:02:43.112 --> 00:02:48.074]  They want societies they can conquer and take full control of now.
[00:02:48.074 --> 00:02:50.895]  And that's what we face.
[00:02:50.895 --> 00:02:52.175]  So we come back from break.
[00:02:52.175 --> 00:02:53.496]  I'm going to get into all of it today.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.061]  I was kind of nostalgic for our old studio.
[00:02:57.061 --> 00:03:00.023]  We're going to go back and forth, different days.
[00:03:00.023 --> 00:03:04.967]  So I decided to come into the studio I've been in for five, six years today.
[00:03:04.967 --> 00:03:08.569]  So it was a bit nostalgic.
[00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:12.532]  And I think in the next few days, we'll move back into the regular new studio.
[00:03:12.532 --> 00:03:16.334]  That's undoubtedly one of the coolest studios in the country.
[00:03:16.334 --> 00:03:21.998]  But what's really important is the news and information that we cover here, my friends.
[00:03:23.513 --> 00:03:31.095]  There is no doubt that there are individuals that are trying to bring down society so they can rebuild it in their image.
[00:03:31.095 --> 00:03:33.556]  That is their admitted goal.
[00:03:33.556 --> 00:03:42.659]  And the outrageous sexualization of children, the outrageous admissions all over the news where they admit they're trying to dismantle the family.
[00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:47.621]  When every indicator and every historical example shows it will create doom.
[00:03:49.005 --> 00:03:54.948]  So we have the headline up on Infowars.com that has the live feed posted in it.
[00:03:54.948 --> 00:03:58.369]  National suicide.
[00:03:58.369 --> 00:04:04.572]  Four in ten Americans embrace socialism.
[00:04:04.572 --> 00:04:11.976]  The scourge, the poison that we've seen historically brought forward.
[00:04:13.815 --> 00:04:24.234]  Offering people all these free wonderful goodies is once again upon us and the individuals that will get free stuff for a season
[00:04:25.691 --> 00:04:30.953]  But understand the strings that come attached to that, that you got to take these vaccines.
[00:04:30.953 --> 00:04:32.833]  You've got to agree to not have children.
[00:04:32.833 --> 00:04:34.954]  You've got to agree to have these political views.
[00:04:34.954 --> 00:04:48.058]  You've got to give up your integrity, your individualism to become kept, domesticated, enslaved in the very definition of the word slavery.
[00:04:48.058 --> 00:04:49.318]  A feudal serf.
[00:04:50.686 --> 00:05:00.214]  Bought off for chicken feed so you wouldn't be a contender in the arena of the real world on this planet.
[00:05:00.214 --> 00:05:05.658]  You know, the worst part about getting old and I'm still strong at 45 is that I won't be there for my children someday.
[00:05:05.658 --> 00:05:07.440]  That's why I need to make them strong now.
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.201]  Now I can be there for my children.
[00:05:09.201 --> 00:05:11.042]  Now I can make them strong.
[00:05:11.042 --> 00:05:12.684]  Now I can instruct them.
[00:05:12.684 --> 00:05:15.406]  Now I can teach them what I've learned, but not once I'm gone.
[00:05:15.506 --> 00:05:20.629]  You think in this digital age, your word's gone forever, but now they're even better at getting rid of what you said they were before.
[00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:26.232]  It's so much easier to burn video or text or languages now that we have high-tech book burning, isn't it?
[00:05:26.232 --> 00:05:29.874]  But I have joined my will to the resistance.
[00:05:29.874 --> 00:05:34.837]  I can't be destroyed now, as long as I realize I've done right and as long as the people know the truth.
[00:05:34.837 --> 00:05:41.661]  And you can't be destroyed either, as long as you bind yourself to something and commit to it and go through the fire for it.
[00:05:41.721 --> 00:05:45.503]  There is a magic that then takes place that transcends space and time.
[00:05:45.503 --> 00:05:53.108]  When you commit via word of mouth, or to pray for us, or to spread our articles and videos, that overrides everything the enemy's doing.
[00:05:53.108 --> 00:05:59.732]  So please now, commit to support InfoWars however you can, and realize your provision to InfoWars is your own provision.
[00:06:03.613 --> 00:06:06.259]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:11.391]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:06:29.662 --> 00:06:37.227]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this live, worldwide broadcast.
[00:06:37.227 --> 00:06:39.988]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:06:39.988 --> 00:06:49.654]  And we're going to be here for the next four hours on this Tuesday transmission.
[00:06:49.654 --> 00:06:54.057]  The news sites are Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[00:06:56.553 --> 00:07:02.999]  Let me just read you some of these headlines that we have here today.
[00:07:02.999 --> 00:07:17.374]  Four in ten Americans embrace some form of socialism in a Gallup poll, buying the poison lie of you're going to live for free, but who has to work as your slave?
[00:07:18.922 --> 00:07:23.824]  The truth is, everyone becomes slaves, except a tiny elite in a system like this.
[00:07:23.824 --> 00:07:30.627]  Another national survey, half of students don't believe all speech is protected under the First Amendment.
[00:07:30.627 --> 00:07:33.208]  They're getting so close to ending free speech.
[00:07:33.208 --> 00:07:37.910]  They say if something hurts someone's feelings, you don't have that speech.
[00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:46.113]  Meanwhile, CBS drama The Good Fight has of course been tweeting out that they want to assassinate
[00:07:47.509 --> 00:07:48.750]  The President.
[00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:55.032]  And they say anyone supporting the President is a Nazi and should be punched in the face.
[00:07:55.032 --> 00:07:58.834]  And it's happening all over the country.
[00:07:58.834 --> 00:08:05.177]  Mainstream corporate television in dramas and in fiction and in news saying attack people physically.
[00:08:05.177 --> 00:08:06.618]  The corporate press defends Antifa.
[00:08:07.523 --> 00:08:13.485]  And then they lie and say that I'm calling for violence on the press, they show no proof, and have me deplatformed.
[00:08:13.485 --> 00:08:15.305]  This is the criminal evil.
[00:08:15.305 --> 00:08:23.248]  Left Wing Beer Company tells customers to hit people over the heads with bricks if they're conservatives.
[00:08:23.248 --> 00:08:28.890]  They have left the tweet up, Twitter is defending it, and they just say that's the way it is.
[00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:31.030]  We're going to hit you over the head with bricks.
[00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:31.851]  Also at Cans,
[00:08:32.881 --> 00:08:39.745]  Films Festival sci-fi film poster features decapitated Donald Trump head in a MAGA hat.
[00:08:41.305 --> 00:08:44.927]  This is all foreshadowing of the 2020 election.
[00:08:44.927 --> 00:08:50.811]  Mass shootings, fire bombings, you name it, all against conservatives.
[00:08:50.811 --> 00:08:53.253]  But there'll be no media coverage when it happens.
[00:08:53.253 --> 00:09:00.097]  Delaware County Church vandalized with abortion rights graffiti.
[00:09:00.097 --> 00:09:03.139]  And more churches are being burned down across Europe and the U.S.
[00:09:03.139 --> 00:09:05.100]  by the thousands.
[00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:06.521]  Left activists
[00:09:09.015 --> 00:09:11.216]  Attack Nigel Farad.
[00:09:11.216 --> 00:09:12.236]  That's right.
[00:09:12.236 --> 00:09:17.258]  And now they're advocating acid attacks against Nigel Farad.
[00:09:17.258 --> 00:09:20.559]  Of course they used to have acid attacks, an Islamic favorite.
[00:09:20.559 --> 00:09:23.060]  Now they have up to seven a day in London alone.
[00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:33.104]  And now leftists are openly advocating and being authorized by Twitter to do the show, throwing acid on this individual.
[00:09:34.835 --> 00:09:42.738]  Milkshakes are being thrown on conservatives and pro-Brexiters all over England and in Europe as well.
[00:09:42.738 --> 00:09:48.440]  And Burger King advertised that people should come there and get their milkshakes and assault people.
[00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:57.823]  Well now they're saying let's throw acid on folks after Nigel Farage was doused in a milkshake yesterday.
[00:09:59.332 --> 00:10:17.046]  So that's that's how they start and now they say let's do it with acid and you saw yesterday Tommy Robinson viciously attacked with hundreds and hundreds of bricks by hordes of Islamists saying he isn't allowed to have free speech in England and the police agreed and ended his authorized permitted rally.
[00:10:18.488 --> 00:10:30.572]  Continuing, Buffalo Wild Wings employees on Twitter threatened to contaminate Trump supporters food by spitting in it and they're so arrogant they posted openly to Twitter with their identities.
[00:10:30.572 --> 00:10:34.793]  That's all up on InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:10:34.793 --> 00:10:45.637]  Al Jazeera gets Twitter to silence critics of its video implying Jews benefited from the Holocaust.
[00:10:45.637 --> 00:10:46.637]  It's a Daily Caller article.
[00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:48.860]  Report!
[00:10:48.860 --> 00:11:01.670]  Alleged Antioch church shooter aimed to kill 10 white churchgoers two years ago, but the media and government covered up that it was a racial attack by a black man on white people.
[00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:03.051]  Continuing.
[00:11:03.051 --> 00:11:11.818]  Representative Ilhan Omar, the two loudest Muslim women in the country, are now in Congress and they both hate America.
[00:11:12.921 --> 00:11:21.864]  And they both shoot their mouths off about how much it sucks all day, but neither one will get the hell out and go back to hell holes like Somalia.
[00:11:21.864 --> 00:11:30.446]  Continuing, leftist rage after New York Times reports the happiest of all wives are religious conservatives, which is, of course, true.
[00:11:30.446 --> 00:11:35.347]  In every study across the planet.
[00:11:35.347 --> 00:11:36.508]  You're not even supposed to have a family.
[00:11:36.508 --> 00:11:37.408]  You're not supposed to have children.
[00:11:37.408 --> 00:11:38.308]  You're not supposed to be happy.
[00:11:38.308 --> 00:11:40.429]  You're supposed to be depressed on Facebook.
[00:11:40.429 --> 00:11:40.909]  They admit it.
[00:11:44.236 --> 00:12:02.964]  Continuing, we're going to go to break here in a few minutes and come back with 4 in 10 Americans embrace some form of socialism and what that bellwether really signifies the latest on China and the trade war that is unfolding there.
[00:12:02.964 --> 00:12:12.028]  I wanted to just stop though for a moment and let listeners know that I want to thank you over the years for all your support.
[00:12:13.365 --> 00:12:18.730]  And everything you've done to make this transmission possible.

[00:12:26.016 --> 00:12:29.720]  So that while you get good products that empower and make your life better,
[00:12:32.758 --> 00:12:48.868]  Pleasurable in the case of something like Wake Up America high-quality coffee, but you can also rest assured that you're helping fund individuals and organizations that are dedicated to taking the globalist on at point-blank range and getting major results.
[00:12:48.868 --> 00:12:57.293]  That's why we're introducing a new sale that is very extensive and very very good.
[00:12:57.293 --> 00:12:59.134]  We're introducing the InfoWars
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:04.543]  Store.com Memorial Day Mega Sale.
[00:13:04.543 --> 00:13:08.305]  Now is the most important time to support the Info War.
[00:13:08.305 --> 00:13:14.469]  My friends, there has never been a more critical time to take a stand in the fight for our Republic.
[00:13:14.469 --> 00:13:17.331]  The level of censorship and attacks are at all-time highs.
[00:13:17.331 --> 00:13:22.074]  Efforts to shut down independent liberty media ahead of their real takeover that's getting ready to happen.
[00:13:22.074 --> 00:13:25.016]  A violent revolution against the family, against Christians.
[00:13:25.016 --> 00:13:26.837]  I mean, it's lined up.
[00:13:26.837 --> 00:13:27.898]  It's ready.

[00:17:28.524 --> 00:17:34.887]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[00:17:34.887 --> 00:17:37.929]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[00:17:37.929 --> 00:17:43.852]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[00:17:43.852 --> 00:17:47.634]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[00:17:47.634 --> 00:17:48.895]  Was there ever a vote?
[00:17:48.895 --> 00:17:49.916]  Who do we fight for?

[00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:06.722]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:06.722 --> 00:20:15.087]  I tracked the news.
[00:20:30.672 --> 00:20:36.674]  As everybody knows, I know the general public that tunes into this broadcast does as well, you want to know what's going on.
[00:20:36.674 --> 00:20:50.760]  And the level of leftist media, but not just news, so-called entertainment, promoting violent attacks on nationalists, on conservatives, on Christians, is exponential.
[00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:52.881]  And we know why.
[00:20:52.881 --> 00:20:54.721]  Here's a headline out of French news agency.
[00:20:54.721 --> 00:20:58.923]  EU leaders sound alarm
[00:21:00.797 --> 00:21:04.138]  Over populist election threat.
[00:21:04.138 --> 00:21:18.603]  And that's because in polls, even though they're skewed polls, 45% of the seats look like they are gonna be lost to the party that Nigel Farage just started a year and a half ago, the Brexit party.
[00:21:18.603 --> 00:21:22.285]  He left UKIP, and UKIP looks like it's gonna get a bunch of seats.
[00:21:22.285 --> 00:21:27.767]  And so these are nationalists, kind of Barry Goldwater, Ron Paul, Alex Jones-esque,
[00:21:28.787 --> 00:21:30.489]  Uh, type deals.
[00:21:30.489 --> 00:21:33.091]  And so they sound the alarm like it's illegal.
[00:21:33.091 --> 00:21:35.093]  Like you can't have that.
[00:21:35.093 --> 00:21:37.135]  We're gonna have open borders.
[00:21:37.135 --> 00:21:38.257]  We're gonna have world government.
[00:21:38.257 --> 00:21:48.486]  We're gonna have the EU bureaucracy be unelected and circumnavigate and override the elected parliament.
[00:21:48.486 --> 00:21:52.911]  And so that's why they said three years ago, they said if Hillary loses, it's the end of globalism.
[00:21:54.807 --> 00:21:59.890]  And now, Hillary lost, and everywhere, populist and nationalist are getting elected.
[00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:13.758]  And so, big tech all over the world, from Latin America, to Africa, to Middle East, to Europe, to Eastern Europe, to Russia, to Asia, is attacking nationalist and populist candidates.
[00:22:13.758 --> 00:22:23.744]  The truth is, the globalists had been taking control of society and civilization with no opposition
[00:22:25.174 --> 00:22:45.043]  Except for, again, Ronald Reagan a little bit, Barry Goldwater, Ron Paul, Congressman Larry McDonnell, and a lot of folks that did talk about this got shot, or they disappeared, or they got grabbed like Congressman Hanson, and almost tortured to death by the IRS.
[00:22:45.043 --> 00:22:50.805]  So in the old days, you talked about this, you ended up in big trouble.
[00:22:50.805 --> 00:22:51.906]  Those of us nowadays, it's
[00:22:53.052 --> 00:23:02.635]  Maybe hot coffee over the head, milkshake in the face, slap the back of the head, audited, deplatformed, called a white supremacist.
[00:23:02.635 --> 00:23:04.836]  And you know, that's not fun.
[00:23:04.836 --> 00:23:07.177]  Bank account's taken away.
[00:23:07.177 --> 00:23:11.198]  But the difference is it's on a mass scale now.
[00:23:11.198 --> 00:23:19.441]  Before they'd shoot Reagan and torture McDonald and disappear him and torture Hanson and say that Barry Goldwater was crazy.
[00:23:23.063 --> 00:23:26.987]  But now, they just un-person you.
[00:23:26.987 --> 00:23:33.133]  Look at some of these headlines that I'm going to be covering coming up.
[00:23:33.133 --> 00:23:38.398]  I mean, they're just pouring in, just pouring in.
[00:23:38.398 --> 00:23:40.240]  Dumbing Down of America.
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:44.044]  SAT exams will now include adversity score.
[00:23:47.932 --> 00:23:57.784]  Developing Democrat Chairman of the House Oversight Committee and wife accused of mass pay to play scandal.
[00:23:57.784 --> 00:23:59.686]  What if the Burger King milkshake tweet?
[00:24:01.138 --> 00:24:04.081]  Prompting violence was Chick-fil-A.
[00:24:04.081 --> 00:24:04.781]  Great question.
[00:24:04.781 --> 00:24:13.349]  8 in 10 Somali teams armed with hammers attack bystanders at East Bank Rail Station in Minnesota.
[00:24:13.349 --> 00:24:15.251]  Media oddly quiet.
[00:24:15.251 --> 00:24:16.712]  They always are.
[00:24:16.712 --> 00:24:18.414]  So I know folks that live up in Minnesota.
[00:24:18.414 --> 00:24:21.317]  GCN, the network that carries some of our programming.
[00:24:22.344 --> 00:24:23.645]  is up there.
[00:24:23.645 --> 00:24:36.176]  And everybody knows the Somalis don't assimilate, and they attack a lot of people, and kill a lot of people, and push little kids off balconies at the Mall of America, and shoot women for no reason.
[00:24:36.176 --> 00:24:42.761]  And that's why I famously said, we love our Somalis, we love our Muslims too.
[00:24:42.761 --> 00:24:44.402]  Oh, they're so good.
[00:24:44.402 --> 00:24:45.804]  Oh, they're so sweet.
[00:24:45.804 --> 00:24:48.186]  I'm gonna stab your daughter at the mall.
[00:24:49.178 --> 00:25:01.348]  Gonna stab your wife, your son, gonna stab him with a butcher knife, and then the police chief is gonna say, we love our Somalis, we love our Muslims too.
[00:25:01.348 --> 00:25:02.849]  Oh, they're so good.
[00:25:02.849 --> 00:25:05.932]  Oh, they're so sweet.
[00:25:05.932 --> 00:25:06.793]  Oh, they're so good.
[00:25:06.793 --> 00:25:09.895]  Oh, they're so sweet.
[00:25:09.895 --> 00:25:12.137]  Something like 80% are on welfare.
[00:25:12.137 --> 00:25:13.218]  Oh, we're so good.
[00:25:13.218 --> 00:25:14.319]  Oh, we're so sweet.
[00:25:14.319 --> 00:25:15.320]  We played that video yesterday.
[00:25:16.308 --> 00:25:19.074]  Where the filmmaker goes through Minneapolis-St.
[00:25:19.074 --> 00:25:24.467]  Paul and not one Somali will tell him that he wants to live in America.
[00:25:24.467 --> 00:25:25.509]  I want to live in Somalia!
[00:25:26.288 --> 00:25:27.189]  You're like, well that doesn't make sense.
[00:25:27.189 --> 00:25:28.790]  You came here, you want to be here.
[00:25:28.790 --> 00:25:30.450]  But see, it's the double think.
[00:25:30.450 --> 00:25:31.211]  It's like Ilhan.
[00:25:31.211 --> 00:25:38.675]  The arrogance she bleeds and oozes and the hate and the sliminess and the creepiness of it.
[00:25:38.675 --> 00:25:41.617]  I mean, women don't get to open their mouths in Somalia.
[00:25:41.617 --> 00:25:43.638]  They're lower than dog excrement.
[00:25:43.638 --> 00:25:47.781]  But here, she can pull up her skirt and just piss all over the Republic.
[00:25:48.021 --> 00:25:49.762]  Piss all over the American flag.
[00:25:49.762 --> 00:25:51.222]  Piss in all our faces.
[00:25:51.222 --> 00:25:52.963]  With those evil beady eyes.
[00:25:52.963 --> 00:25:54.064]  That evil smile.
[00:25:54.064 --> 00:25:56.185]  Cause she knows we're gonna submit to her.
[00:25:56.185 --> 00:25:57.645]  Cause she's better than us.
[00:25:57.645 --> 00:25:59.726]  And she's gonna feed on us.
[00:25:59.726 --> 00:26:02.207]  Her boys are gonna beat your white heads in.
[00:26:02.207 --> 00:26:03.268]  With hammers!
[00:26:03.268 --> 00:26:07.630]  And the media's gonna love it!
[00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:11.191]  Because our Somalis are sweet.
[00:26:11.191 --> 00:26:12.872]  Oh, that's the sweet.
[00:26:12.872 --> 00:26:14.153]  Oh, that's the sweet.
[00:26:14.153 --> 00:26:15.653]  Sweet, sweet, sweet.
[00:26:15.653 --> 00:26:16.694]  Mwah, mwah, mwah.
[00:26:18.171 --> 00:26:20.053]  So thank you, Ilhan.
[00:26:20.053 --> 00:26:22.074]  Look at that fixed phone.
[00:26:22.074 --> 00:26:25.157]  So superior, so arrogant.
[00:26:25.157 --> 00:26:27.839]  Her country isn't a country.
[00:26:27.839 --> 00:26:41.451]  It's a backwards road warrior hell pit, where the main industry is piracy, and the next industry is slavery of non-Somalis.
[00:26:41.451 --> 00:26:43.973]  And she knows business is gonna be good.
[00:26:43.973 --> 00:26:45.635]  She's a criminal con artist.
[00:26:47.153 --> 00:26:50.014]  Married her brother to bring him here, then married other men.
[00:26:50.014 --> 00:26:55.395]  And she's gonna sit up there with her inferiority complex.
[00:26:55.395 --> 00:26:59.856]  And she is gonna make you bow to her.
[00:26:59.856 --> 00:27:01.076]  It's awful, she keeps laughing.
[00:27:01.076 --> 00:27:02.717]  She can't believe it.
[00:27:02.717 --> 00:27:06.618]  She can't believe the scams and the fraud that you know she's running right now.
[00:27:06.618 --> 00:27:08.658]  She can't believe how weak you are.
[00:27:08.658 --> 00:27:11.159]  She can't believe how she's preying on you.
[00:27:11.159 --> 00:27:13.539]  She can't believe how disingenuous she is.
[00:27:13.539 --> 00:27:15.020]  She cannot believe it!
[00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:15.980]  How much she loves it!
[00:27:17.694 --> 00:27:19.936]  Oh, but I haven't gotten to any of the stories yet, sorry.
[00:27:19.936 --> 00:27:22.257]  We love our Somalis.
[00:27:22.257 --> 00:27:24.759]  We love our Muslims too.
[00:27:24.759 --> 00:27:26.640]  Oh, they're so good.
[00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:30.282]  Oh, they're so sweet.
[00:27:30.282 --> 00:27:34.145]  Thousands of churches burning in Europe.
[00:27:34.145 --> 00:27:36.306]  Oh, they're so sweet.
[00:27:36.306 --> 00:27:37.427]  Continuing.
[00:27:37.427 --> 00:27:42.691]  Republican Google engineer writes open letter about company's outrage mobs and witch hunts.
[00:27:42.691 --> 00:27:42.771]  Oh.
[00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:44.220]  U.S.
[00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:49.544]  fined Wall Street $20 billion over the last five years, but collected only about half.
[00:27:49.544 --> 00:27:53.947]  The New York Times subsidiary rewrites scoop about Trump's EPA.
[00:27:53.947 --> 00:27:56.208]  Doesn't issue a correction.
[00:27:56.208 --> 00:28:00.391]  A huge number of North Korean women are sold into Chinese sex slavery.
[00:28:00.391 --> 00:28:04.454]  Report says, but it's okay, because only white people can be evil.
[00:28:04.454 --> 00:28:09.097]  So if you've got five African countries selling people into slavery, it's okay!
[00:28:10.228 --> 00:28:14.850]  If you've got the Koreans selling their own people into slavery, it's okay.
[00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:16.670]  They're not white.
[00:28:16.670 --> 00:28:19.371]  Everyone who's not white is God.
[00:28:19.371 --> 00:28:21.532]  Everyone white is bad.
[00:28:21.532 --> 00:28:24.973]  You've got to learn leftist ideology here.
[00:28:24.973 --> 00:28:32.776]  Of course, isn't it really racist to not care if women are Asian being sold to slavery or that the Chinese have killed 150 million of their own people?
[00:28:32.776 --> 00:28:34.476]  Oh, no.
[00:28:34.476 --> 00:28:35.997]  Oh, no.
[00:28:35.997 --> 00:28:37.437]  Oh, no.
[00:28:37.437 --> 00:28:39.238]  When David Knight's wife one time in an abortion
[00:28:40.456 --> 00:28:41.036]  Demonstration.
[00:28:41.036 --> 00:28:42.857]  The interview was that.
[00:28:42.857 --> 00:28:44.958]  She said, you know, I adopted a child.
[00:28:44.958 --> 00:28:47.099]  She goes, yeah, you little white pig.
[00:28:47.099 --> 00:28:48.960]  She goes, no, actually it was Chinese.
[00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:51.001]  She goes, oh yeah, virtue signaling.
[00:28:51.001 --> 00:28:55.263]  It'd just be better to kill that baby.
[00:28:55.263 --> 00:28:56.044]  Kill babies.
[00:28:56.044 --> 00:28:56.764]  Kill babies.
[00:28:56.764 --> 00:28:57.945]  We have the moral high ground.
[00:28:57.945 --> 00:28:58.505]  Kill babies.
[00:28:59.304 --> 00:29:02.007]  Everyone knows, even good people fall on hard times.
[00:29:02.007 --> 00:29:05.411]  Your credit cards get maxed out, and you get behind on your taxes.
[00:29:05.411 --> 00:29:10.076]  Unfortunately, the IRS is not as understanding, and they won't stop until they collect.
[00:29:10.076 --> 00:29:14.741]  They have the power to take your paycheck, freeze your bank accounts, even your home or business could be at risk.
[00:29:14.941 --> 00:29:18.283]  It's simply not worth it to take on the IRS by yourself.
[00:29:18.283 --> 00:29:20.865]  You need to call the experts at Optima Tax Relief.
[00:29:20.865 --> 00:29:23.587]  When you call, be sure to ask about the Fresh Start Initiative.

[00:29:45.101 --> 00:29:45.522]  Optima Tax Relief.
[00:30:02.222 --> 00:30:04.083]  Mike in New Jersey, you're on the air.
[00:30:04.083 --> 00:30:04.964]  Thanks for calling, Mike.
[00:30:04.964 --> 00:30:06.325]  You are the man, Alex.
[00:30:06.325 --> 00:30:07.826]  I'm so glad to be talking to you.
[00:30:07.826 --> 00:30:08.627]  I'm so excited.
[00:30:08.627 --> 00:30:09.548]  I'm such a big fan.
[00:30:09.548 --> 00:30:12.029]  Ever since I've been listening, I've been buying your products.
[00:30:12.029 --> 00:30:14.531]  I gotta do a shout-out for the Bone Broth.
[00:30:14.531 --> 00:30:15.952]  The Bone Broth.
[00:30:15.952 --> 00:30:17.393]  The Bone Broth.
[00:30:17.393 --> 00:30:18.775]  The B-B-Bone Broth.
[00:30:18.775 --> 00:30:20.055]  The B-B-Bone Broth.
[00:30:20.055 --> 00:30:24.799]  Tastes like, tastes like a great milkshake, you know, if you just add it to milk.
[00:30:24.799 --> 00:30:25.980]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:27.641]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[00:30:27.641 --> 00:30:29.202]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[00:30:29.202 --> 00:30:29.943]  Like good.
[00:30:30.283 --> 00:30:30.863]  Whoa!
[00:30:30.863 --> 00:30:32.584]  I feel great since I've been taking it.
[00:30:32.584 --> 00:30:36.765]  My daughter uses the Bubble Gum Fluoride Free Toothpaste.
[00:30:36.765 --> 00:30:40.546]  I've used the Super Male Vitality, a host of other products.
[00:30:40.546 --> 00:30:42.606]  So thank you so much for that as well.
[00:30:42.606 --> 00:30:45.167]  Brother, you're thanking me for buying the products and keeping us on air.
[00:30:45.167 --> 00:30:45.907]  I'm thanking you.
[00:30:45.907 --> 00:30:52.369]  But yes, this is the ultimate bone broth formula with the turmeric, the chaga mushroom, the true bone broth.
[00:30:52.369 --> 00:30:53.169]  It is next level.
[00:30:53.169 --> 00:30:53.749]  It really is good.
[00:30:53.749 --> 00:30:54.289]  So thank you.
[00:30:54.289 --> 00:30:56.230]  I feel great since I've been taking it.
[00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:56.610]  Thank you.
[00:31:00.174 --> 00:31:03.176]  Everybody knows that supplements are amazing.
[00:31:03.176 --> 00:31:05.757]  That what God gave us from Mother Nature is incredible.
[00:31:05.757 --> 00:31:08.539]  That's why supplements are the biggest growing industry in the world.
[00:31:08.539 --> 00:31:10.540]  And the globalists are so upset.
[00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:13.362]  The problem is people forget to take them.
[00:31:14.605 --> 00:31:19.689]  And that's why the whole industry has moved towards packets that you take in the morning and you take at night.
[00:31:19.689 --> 00:31:20.650]  So we looked at that.
[00:31:20.650 --> 00:31:22.271]  We made the very best a.m.
[00:31:22.271 --> 00:31:22.712]  and p.m.
[00:31:22.712 --> 00:31:30.998]  packets out there with an incredible spectrum of 13 different capsules that you take in two servings a day that are game-changing a.m.
[00:31:30.998 --> 00:31:32.079]  and p.m.
[00:31:32.079 --> 00:31:34.702]  total health and performance eight pack

[00:31:53.852 --> 00:31:59.077]  We looked at the best-selling products out there, and we made it even better, and we lowered the price.
[00:32:00.945 --> 00:32:08.335]  What you have witnessed is the biggest development in free speech in the western world's history.
[00:32:08.335 --> 00:32:12.620]  This is a digital, AI-enforced, gag order.
[00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:16.345]  Not to say the name Alex Jones or InfoWars.com.
[00:32:21.991 --> 00:32:23.712]  This is Nazi Germany level.
[00:32:23.712 --> 00:32:24.913]  This is racketeering.
[00:32:24.913 --> 00:32:26.033]  This is cartels.
[00:32:26.033 --> 00:32:28.455]  Mr. President, we need your help.
[00:32:28.455 --> 00:32:30.316]  We need it now.
[00:32:30.316 --> 00:32:32.017]  You can take on Big Ted.
[00:32:32.017 --> 00:32:40.962]  They saw Infowars as a dominant, independent, anti-war, pro-human, pro-sovereign, pro-family, populist organization.
[00:32:40.962 --> 00:32:49.006]  So they thought, first they come for Alex Jones, then when people say, okay, take him off the air, everyone else like dominoes would fall.
[00:32:49.006 --> 00:32:49.867]  The way to fight back
[00:32:50.507 --> 00:32:52.008]  I'm angry I've had enough of these people
[00:33:18.815 --> 00:33:30.384]  They're a bunch of Christian murderous scum They're on giant death factories keeping babies alive And selling their body parts What more do you need to know about these people?
[00:33:30.384 --> 00:33:43.535]  Eyeball out and face this scum They literally crawl out from under us They have green looking skin And they run around screaming We love Satan, we want to eat babies
[00:33:45.518 --> 00:33:47.619]  I have them on video.
[00:33:47.619 --> 00:33:50.040]  I f***ing love Satan, so f*** you.
[00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:51.481]  I kill my kids.
[00:33:51.481 --> 00:33:55.282]  Hillary's in the creepy weird six-step man.
[00:33:55.282 --> 00:33:58.984]  We came, we saw, he died.
[00:33:58.984 --> 00:34:06.668]  She sleeps in the same room with that creepy weirdo woman whose mother wears a foot over her head.
[00:34:06.668 --> 00:34:10.529]  That woman number one is ugly.
[00:34:10.529 --> 00:34:13.291]  Imagine how bad she smells, man.
[00:34:14.471 --> 00:34:27.775]  There's a guy on the radio who apparently trumps on his show frequently.
[00:34:27.775 --> 00:34:29.835]  He said me and Hillary are demons.
[00:34:29.835 --> 00:34:31.436]  Said we smell like sulfur.
[00:34:31.436 --> 00:34:33.436]  Ain't that something?
[00:34:33.436 --> 00:34:36.797]  I have never seen or smelled any woman like that, ever.
[00:34:37.097 --> 00:34:38.238]  People are telling me she smells.
[00:34:38.238 --> 00:34:40.380]  Who could not notice someone who smelled that bad?
[00:34:57.325 --> 00:34:59.707]  You're such self-centered crap.
[00:34:59.707 --> 00:35:04.390]  We don't even notice and it's self-rising up against us.
[00:35:04.390 --> 00:35:12.436]  Millions of pointed people of the very worst type and I'm so pissed.
[00:35:12.436 --> 00:35:18.661]  We're gonna stab your daughter at the mall.
[00:35:18.661 --> 00:35:22.964]  We're gonna stab your wife, your son.
[00:35:27.935 --> 00:35:42.476]  We're gonna stab you with a butcher knife, and then the police chief is gonna say, we love our Somalis, we love our Muslims, oh they're so good, oh they're so sweet.
[00:35:46.167 --> 00:35:52.429]  I was watching Fox News as I worked out this morning, and they had the police chief on making excuses from that town in Minnesota.
[00:35:52.429 --> 00:35:56.150]  And they had the Fox News host, this is the Fair and Balanced channel, going.
[00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:58.631]  Donald Trump really stepped in at this time.
[00:35:58.631 --> 00:36:03.453]  He said it was a bombing before it had officially been called a bombing, and Hillary's on him.
[00:36:12.665 --> 00:36:18.088]  Crashing the lies and disinformation Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:36:18.088 --> 00:36:18.749]  to 3 p.m.
[00:36:18.749 --> 00:36:19.649]  Central.
[00:36:19.649 --> 00:36:23.732]  Then I return of course Sundays 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:36:23.732 --> 00:36:28.394]  We have Owen Schroyer and the great job that he does 3 to 6 p.m.
[00:36:28.394 --> 00:36:31.076]  with the war room and of course David Knight knocking it out of the park.
[00:36:31.076 --> 00:36:34.438]  Weekday mornings kick off 11 a.m.
[00:36:34.438 --> 00:36:38.820]  Okay and again I'm not trying to target the poor little dear sweet Somalis.
[00:36:39.827 --> 00:36:47.915]  But they are an extremely tribal group that attacks all their neighboring African tribes and that doesn't work with or get along with anybody.
[00:36:47.915 --> 00:36:51.338]  It is known as the most piratical, dangerous country in the world.
[00:36:51.338 --> 00:36:54.882]  They have no working government or system.
[00:36:54.882 --> 00:36:56.343]  And in Minneapolis-St.
[00:36:56.343 --> 00:36:59.947]  Paul, you have the leftist, brain-damaged population up there.
[00:37:01.656 --> 00:37:05.617]  Where you have attacks, basically racial attacks, every day at the mall.
[00:37:05.617 --> 00:37:14.259]  Little babies being thrown off balconies, little white babies, families being attacked, robbed, stabbed, and the media tries to cover it up.
[00:37:14.259 --> 00:37:18.881]  But they're having problems, because it did show up in the local news.
[00:37:18.881 --> 00:37:21.281]  This was just today.
[00:37:21.281 --> 00:37:24.142]  Isn't this loving?
[00:37:24.142 --> 00:37:26.703]  Eight to ten Somali teens armed with hammers
[00:37:27.876 --> 00:37:32.219]  Attacked bystanders at East Bank Rail Station in Minnesota.
[00:37:32.219 --> 00:37:35.222]  Media oddly quiet.
[00:37:35.222 --> 00:37:45.589]  Alpha News Minnesota has reported the group of 8 to 10 Somali teens attacked travelers in the East Bank Light Rail Station in Minneapolis on Friday night.
[00:37:45.589 --> 00:37:47.251]  Took days for it to get reported.
[00:37:47.251 --> 00:37:49.953]  There were several injuries reported.
[00:37:49.953 --> 00:37:52.735]  Here is the Minneapolis Police Department dispatch.
[00:37:55.151 --> 00:37:57.452]  And I'm going to play that dispatch coming up next hour.
[00:37:57.452 --> 00:37:58.713]  We're going to play that for you.
[00:37:58.713 --> 00:38:01.534]  We're going to humanize the folks being racially attacked.
[00:38:01.534 --> 00:38:03.055]  It gets to that.
[00:38:03.055 --> 00:38:08.197]  They were going after anyone who looked like they were dressed nice and was white.
[00:38:08.197 --> 00:38:10.858]  Dressed nice and was white.
[00:38:10.858 --> 00:38:15.220]  The station stop is located next to the University of Minneapolis campus.
[00:38:17.233 --> 00:38:21.677]  The incident was apparently reported to 9-1-1 just before 10 p.m.
[00:38:21.677 --> 00:38:26.682]  on Friday according to audio and the social media police scanner reports.
[00:38:26.682 --> 00:38:28.343]  At 9 48 p.m.
[00:38:28.343 --> 00:38:32.587]  by the way in Europe they're banning even showing police reports and news if it's Muslims.
[00:38:32.587 --> 00:38:33.668]  It's true.
[00:38:33.668 --> 00:38:33.928]  At 9 48 p.m.
[00:38:33.928 --> 00:38:34.309]  Facebook post
[00:38:36.468 --> 00:38:52.973]  On the 2nd Precinct, Minneapolis Crime Watch page said that University of Minnesota, U of M Police were requesting assistance from Minneapolis Police, MPD and Metro Transit Police for a group of 8-10 males chasing people with hammers.
[00:38:52.973 --> 00:38:54.453]  And that some people were injured.
[00:38:55.413 --> 00:39:12.620]  A Facebook post a minute later on Minneapolis Scanner said that the three police departments were responding to multiple 911 calls about 10 to 12 Somali teen males armed with hammers chasing people, also with several injuries reported.
[00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:20.283]  Both Facebook pages regularly post summaries of police scanner audio, but you won't get it on local news because that's verboten.
[00:39:21.562 --> 00:39:33.412]  A person who claimed on social media to have been at the station when the incident occurred said that the group of males had hammers and bars and they were seemed to be attacking anyone who looked like they had money or were white.
[00:39:33.412 --> 00:39:48.143]  The witnesses who said he isn't white said he didn't want to take on a bunch of dudes with blunt objects and that he hurried an older white lady away and they walked a few blocks to catch a bus.
[00:39:48.143 --> 00:39:49.124]  Coming up we're going to play
[00:39:50.723 --> 00:39:54.465]  That audio for you, but folks, I see this every day.
[00:39:54.465 --> 00:40:01.010]  That's why three years ago I did a rant about, we love our Somalis, we love our Muslims too, oh they so good, oh they so sweet.
[00:40:01.010 --> 00:40:18.901]  I mean, just yesterday I showed you footage all over England of people being hit with bricks, with rocks, with milkshakes, and now the left is on Twitter calling for acid attacks on conservatives and Christians, and for more churches to be burned down.
[00:40:23.939 --> 00:40:33.041]  So again, you've got folks from tribal countries who basically are brought into our countries from the Middle Ages.
[00:40:33.041 --> 00:40:42.664]  And yes, if you went back to ancient Germany, or what's Germany today, or France, or England, or Italy,
[00:40:45.308 --> 00:40:53.172]  And let's say a couple hundred people that look different moved into that neighborhood, you would get attacked in about five minutes.
[00:40:53.172 --> 00:40:54.073]  That's tribalism.
[00:40:54.073 --> 00:40:54.853]  Because people learn.
[00:40:54.853 --> 00:40:57.115]  You let an outside group in, they do this.
[00:40:57.115 --> 00:41:05.159]  Now under the egalitarian Christian era of the Renaissance, we thought we could unify everybody according to an ethos of ideas and freedom.
[00:41:05.159 --> 00:41:10.522]  The globalist technocrats have taken over the universities, taken over media, taken over the culture,
[00:41:11.769 --> 00:41:17.431]  And they've said, we're abolishing all that, and we're going back to tribal balkanization.
[00:41:17.431 --> 00:41:21.573]  That's why the colleges encourage segregation again.
[00:41:21.573 --> 00:41:25.534]  That's why the media pushes that.
[00:41:25.534 --> 00:41:32.457]  And they tell you on CBS television shows, the good fight, assassinate Trump.
[00:41:32.457 --> 00:41:36.178]  Any Trump supporter is a Nazi, attack them.
[00:41:36.178 --> 00:41:38.639]  We've given the so-called moral high ground to the left,
[00:41:39.673 --> 00:41:41.935]  To say, oh, don't take Nazi speech away.
[00:41:41.935 --> 00:41:49.081]  Well, that's what you should be saying, even if you disagree with them, which I do.
[00:41:49.081 --> 00:41:59.611]  But instead they say, oh, take the Nazi speech away, but you're misapplying this joke to a comedian, or you're misapplying it to somebody else and what they said.
[00:41:59.611 --> 00:42:01.953]  And so, this is out of control.
[00:42:01.953 --> 00:42:05.136]  Only ban the racist white people's speech.
[00:42:05.136 --> 00:42:06.557]  You're now banning everybody's speech.
[00:42:10.256 --> 00:42:11.297]  Take Bernie Sanders.
[00:42:11.297 --> 00:42:15.099]  He just did what Bill Clinton did when he was in Alabama a few years ago.
[00:42:15.099 --> 00:42:21.163]  Bernie Sanders held up, and I'm not defending Bernie Sanders politics, I was defending him.
[00:42:21.163 --> 00:42:24.545]  He's at a restaurant showing off somebody's southern food.
[00:42:24.545 --> 00:42:30.428]  My mouth's actually starting to water just thinking about a drumstick.
[00:42:30.428 --> 00:42:32.350]  And even the right wing jumped on Sanders.
[00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:39.603]  Going, oh look, because if a conservative ate a piece of chicken by a black guy, the left would say they were racist.
[00:42:39.603 --> 00:42:40.723]  That's mental illness!
[00:42:40.723 --> 00:42:41.403]  That's insane!
[00:42:41.403 --> 00:42:43.925]  You're at somebody's restaurant, you eat their food!
[00:42:43.925 --> 00:42:45.045]  Fried chicken's great!
[00:42:45.045 --> 00:42:46.506]  Everybody eats fried chicken!
[00:42:46.506 --> 00:42:48.547]  What the hell are you talking about?
[00:42:48.547 --> 00:42:57.791]  But again, this is how they create the mass mental illness to project racism where it isn't there, and then defend real racism when black people are beating whites in the heads with hammers.
[00:42:59.403 --> 00:43:01.065]  Do not shut down our speech!
[00:43:01.065 --> 00:43:06.550]  We're at Infowars.com and Newswars.com, and we're defeating the leftist tyrants!
[00:43:06.550 --> 00:43:14.076]  I got mobbed on the streets by fans, but almost all of them said, we used to love you on air, it was so good to see you on the iTunes or on YouTube.
[00:43:14.076 --> 00:43:15.398]  Are you coming back?
[00:43:15.398 --> 00:43:16.539]  We're at Infowars.com.
[00:43:17.139 --> 00:43:18.500]  We're at NewsWords.com.
[00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:20.761]  Paul Watson's launched his own Summit.News.
[00:43:20.761 --> 00:43:22.762]  We have our own videos, we have our own articles.
[00:43:22.762 --> 00:43:27.525]  They're trying to destroy us, but thanks to you and others having us on, InfoWars are still chugging along.
[00:43:27.525 --> 00:43:29.786]  So we're there, folks, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:43:29.786 --> 00:43:31.347]  InfoWars!
[00:43:31.347 --> 00:43:34.689]  Don't tell me!
[00:43:34.689 --> 00:43:34.749]  Woo!
[00:43:36.121 --> 00:43:38.882]  InfoWars.com, because that's a bunch of people out here.
[00:43:38.882 --> 00:43:40.702]  I'm talking about InfoWars.com.
[00:43:40.702 --> 00:43:43.323]  I'm at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:43:43.323 --> 00:43:45.684]  We knew this censorship was coming forever.
[00:43:45.684 --> 00:43:49.165]  We have our own video streams, our own audio streams, and it's all free to air.
[00:43:49.165 --> 00:43:51.905]  Anybody can use it, re-upload it, do whatever you want.
[00:43:51.905 --> 00:43:54.166]  People go to InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:43:54.166 --> 00:43:55.166]  That's where they find it.
[00:43:55.166 --> 00:43:57.147]  You know, there's things called websites.
[00:43:57.147 --> 00:43:57.567]  Just go there.
[00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:11.209]  It would take me more than an hour just to lay out all the admitted benefits and known positive effects of just one of the ingredients in our ultimate bone broth formula.
[00:44:11.209 --> 00:44:19.596]  Everybody knows about bone broth itself and all of the amazing things that it's associated with, and that it's been the big craze for at least a decade.
[00:44:19.596 --> 00:44:23.719]  Well, thousands of years ago, it's what everybody told people they should drink in a soup if they were sick.
[00:44:24.580 --> 00:44:31.308]  But then you add, not to the fact that this is the strongest, most concentrated, highest quality bone broth out there, literally.
[00:44:31.308 --> 00:44:42.001]  Then you have the chaga mushroom, then you have the turmeric, then you have the bee pollen, then you have the other key ingredients that are all known to just make people incredibly strong and healthy.
[00:44:42.521 --> 00:44:44.764]  Our Ultimate Bone Broth Formula is amazing.
[00:44:44.764 --> 00:44:49.629]  It's 50% off right now at ForWarsTore.com because I want you to try it and see how great it is.
[00:44:49.629 --> 00:44:52.492]  And of course, getting the bone broth isn't just great for you and your family.
[00:44:52.492 --> 00:44:58.639]  It's also amazing when it comes to funding our operation that's taking on the globalists and fighting for all of our freedoms.
[00:45:00.746 --> 00:45:05.330]  Stacey in the great state of Texas in FEMA Region 6.
[00:45:05.330 --> 00:45:07.352]  You're on the air worldwide, Stacey.
[00:45:07.352 --> 00:45:08.453]  Good to talk to you.
[00:45:08.453 --> 00:45:13.098]  Before I get into what I want to say, I just want to let you know that I don't normally take vitamins at all.
[00:45:13.098 --> 00:45:15.040]  I was turned on to the ultimate female force.
[00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:19.604]  I looked at all the ingredients and they're all organic, root, things like that, that I trust.
[00:45:19.884 --> 00:45:25.850]  You know, because I've seen a lot of other vitamins that don't have things that they say that they have in them, and they're often not things that are natural.
[00:45:25.850 --> 00:45:26.550]  I appreciate that.
[00:45:26.550 --> 00:45:28.212]  Well, what happened with Ultimate Female Force?
[00:45:28.212 --> 00:45:28.832]  Tell us about it.
[00:45:28.832 --> 00:45:29.593]  Well, it's really great.
[00:45:29.593 --> 00:45:30.894]  You know, it's like a multivitamin.
[00:45:30.894 --> 00:45:31.415]  I take it.
[00:45:31.415 --> 00:45:32.155]  It tastes good.
[00:45:32.155 --> 00:45:33.997]  It doesn't have that nasty aftertaste.
[00:45:33.997 --> 00:45:35.959]  It actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste.
[00:45:35.959 --> 00:45:39.442]  And, you know, it just gives me energy and fuels me throughout the day, so I really like it.
[00:45:39.462 --> 00:45:42.283]  Well, just so you know, we look at whatever the best herbs are.
[00:45:42.283 --> 00:45:44.043]  They're known to turbocharge women.
[00:45:44.043 --> 00:45:46.124]  And then we get the organic ones and put it in it.
[00:45:46.124 --> 00:45:49.484]  So yeah, stamina, libido, energy.
[00:45:49.484 --> 00:45:52.305]  These are amazing things and ultimate female force.
[00:45:52.305 --> 00:45:53.445]  So I'm glad you plugged it.
[00:45:53.445 --> 00:45:55.286]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:46:09.403 --> 00:46:18.407]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[00:46:18.407 --> 00:46:28.472]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[00:46:28.472 --> 00:46:37.017]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[00:46:37.837 --> 00:46:39.178]  There's nothing else like it.
[00:46:39.178 --> 00:46:40.339]  You must experience it.
[00:46:40.339 --> 00:46:42.320]  It is a total game-changer.
[00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:47.343]  And it comes in easy-to-use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[00:46:47.343 --> 00:46:48.864]  Warning, though, it's very, very strong.
[00:46:48.864 --> 00:46:50.344]  It lasts 10 hours.
[00:46:50.344 --> 00:46:57.048]  So take a half-pack the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.
[00:46:57.048 --> 00:47:03.832]  TurboForce at m4slife.com.
[00:47:03.832 --> 00:47:06.534]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:28.547 --> 00:47:35.251]  Ladies and gentlemen, there is a clash of civilizations being carried out by the globalists.
[00:47:35.251 --> 00:47:43.477]  And when they're done, it's meant to reduce world population massively and on its ashes build a technocracy.
[00:47:43.477 --> 00:47:50.041]  So it doesn't matter if you're a Christian, or a Muslim, or a Jew, or an atheist, or an animist, or a Hindu.
[00:47:51.314 --> 00:47:52.435]  Or a Buddhist.
[00:47:52.435 --> 00:47:58.441]  The globalists have a system that they are putting in place, that they are forcing us into.
[00:47:58.441 --> 00:47:59.622]  It's poisonous.
[00:47:59.622 --> 00:48:00.783]  It's toxic.
[00:48:00.783 --> 00:48:02.124]  It's anti-human.
[00:48:02.124 --> 00:48:03.225]  It kills us.
[00:48:03.225 --> 00:48:05.027]  It's a plan.
[00:48:05.027 --> 00:48:07.229]  And we're not part of it in the future.
[00:48:07.229 --> 00:48:11.493]  I'm going to break that down next hour.
[00:48:11.493 --> 00:48:13.395]  We also have our reporters in the field.
[00:48:15.011 --> 00:48:29.639]  Here in Austin, Texas, Caitlin Bennett and Millie Weaver are downtown at a pro-abortion rally that the left is having, and our crew is going to be covering that, and so much more.
[00:48:29.639 --> 00:48:33.260]  And there is a full report that Millie did that we haven't aired yet.
[00:48:33.260 --> 00:48:41.625]  They aired like six minutes, I think, yesterday, but it's a 15-minute interview with her and her husband with their three-month-old baby that's so darling, little girl.
[00:48:42.822 --> 00:48:58.168]  And just the juxtapose of these women hyping their right to kill their babies like it's a sacrament but not caring about even already born children and saying get rid of children after they're born.
[00:48:58.168 --> 00:48:59.448]  It's just crazy.
[00:48:59.448 --> 00:49:05.991]  It's absolutely out of control how they've twisted the minds of the people in this country.
[00:49:07.961 --> 00:49:08.761]  Medical tyranny.
[00:49:08.761 --> 00:49:12.263]  Hospital tries to force spinal tap procedures on newborns.
[00:49:12.263 --> 00:49:19.625]  Any newborn with any fever now, they want to do a spinal tap on them so they can help give an entry point for meningitis.
[00:49:19.625 --> 00:49:20.646]  That's right.
[00:49:20.646 --> 00:49:26.027]  Infant mortality is skyrocketing in this nation by design.
[00:49:26.027 --> 00:49:30.429]  It's being done incrementally so the doctors and nurses go along with it.
[00:49:30.429 --> 00:49:32.930]  That's all coming up.
[00:49:32.930 --> 00:49:36.211]  Now, I want to get to this report.
[00:49:38.114 --> 00:49:56.163]  This incredibly important report that we're linking up on Infowars.com and Newswars.com and talk about the cost of real journalism that's pro-humanity.
[00:49:56.163 --> 00:49:59.505]  The cost of doing things that really change the world.
[00:49:59.505 --> 00:50:01.406]  You get sued.
[00:50:01.406 --> 00:50:03.147]  You get harassed.
[00:50:03.147 --> 00:50:04.988]  You get indicted.
[00:50:04.988 --> 00:50:06.149]  You get boycotted.
[00:50:06.897 --> 00:50:12.622]  You get your bank accounts turned off because you're doing good.
[00:50:12.622 --> 00:50:21.549]  Journalists charged with 15 felonies for undercover videos exposing Planned Parenthood take a hit in court.
[00:50:21.549 --> 00:50:33.119]  And it's always run, that's the Daily Wire, like, oh, when you get sued for helping get Trump elected, or when you get in trouble for standing up for the unborn, you're a loser.
[00:50:34.574 --> 00:50:39.516]  No, you're a target that had courage that stood up and did the right thing.
[00:50:39.516 --> 00:50:42.136]  But when you're over the target, you'll be getting the flack.
[00:50:42.136 --> 00:50:46.958]  When you're promoting fake WMDs in Iraq, you get Pulitzers.
[00:50:46.958 --> 00:50:55.220]  When you're promoting that Russia runs our elections and that Trump's a Russian agent, you get Pulitzer Prizes at the New York Times.
[00:50:55.220 --> 00:50:56.281]  It's a joke.
[00:50:56.281 --> 00:51:00.042]  When you launch a bunch of wars like Obama, you get Peace Prizes.
[00:51:00.042 --> 00:51:03.203]  When you try to stop wars, you get the opposite.
[00:51:04.062 --> 00:51:10.908]  Journalists charged with 15 felonies for undercover videos exposing Planned Parenthood take a hit in court.
[00:51:10.908 --> 00:51:26.622]  Journalists David Deladin and Sandra Merritt, who exposed suspect dealings at taxpayer-funded abortion mill Planned Parenthood in undercover videos, were denied a request to halt criminal prosecution
[00:51:27.788 --> 00:51:38.990]  A press release from the Thomas More Society said, last month the California Supreme Court issued a stay in the high-profile case based on political bias and selective prosecution.
[00:51:38.990 --> 00:51:41.791]  That's even the California Lepus Court.
[00:51:41.791 --> 00:51:44.391]  But now the case is moving forward.
[00:51:44.391 --> 00:51:49.652]  Now remember, if you do undercover video and it shows a crime, you're protected.
[00:51:49.652 --> 00:51:53.213]  Or if you believed it was a crime, reasonably, that's whistleblower protection.
[00:51:55.131 --> 00:52:04.375]  They caught people talking about making millions off selling baby parts, people talking about keeping babies alive so they can be harvested.
[00:52:04.375 --> 00:52:07.796]  Inside the abortion clinics, they caught it all.
[00:52:07.796 --> 00:52:09.797]  Outside the abortion clinics.
[00:52:09.797 --> 00:52:11.158]  And then they're getting charged.
[00:52:11.158 --> 00:52:16.180]  Now they've been charged in Texas and other jurisdictions, it's been thrown out later.
[00:52:16.180 --> 00:52:18.040]  But not in California, folks.
[00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:19.241]  But these people aren't losers.
[00:52:20.452 --> 00:52:23.894]  The way the world works, all the time I say, oh, look, this stock went down.
[00:52:23.894 --> 00:52:25.274]  Somebody goes, well, I don't own that stock.
[00:52:25.274 --> 00:52:26.215]  I don't care.
[00:52:26.215 --> 00:52:27.716]  It affects the whole economy.
[00:52:27.716 --> 00:52:30.577]  Or, hey, did you hear about such and such?
[00:52:30.577 --> 00:52:31.918]  They go, well, that doesn't affect me.
[00:52:31.918 --> 00:52:34.639]  Everything affects everybody.
[00:52:34.639 --> 00:52:37.781]  And the average person goes, oh, look, they're in trouble.
[00:52:37.781 --> 00:52:40.042]  They're losers.
[00:52:40.042 --> 00:52:44.164]  No, when you get attacked for what's right, you're the best kind of winner.
[00:52:44.164 --> 00:52:45.184]  You're a patriot.
[00:52:45.184 --> 00:52:46.405]  You're a hero.
[00:52:46.405 --> 00:52:49.947]  But they always try to phrase it everywhere, like, ooh, losers.
[00:52:52.042 --> 00:52:58.285]  They were hit with 15 felony charges in March of 17 for their undercover work.
[00:52:58.285 --> 00:53:04.928]  Their charges were widely decried for their threat to journalists, including by left-wing Los Angeles Times.
[00:53:04.928 --> 00:53:12.411]  Felony charges are a disturbing overreach for the duo behind the Planned Parenthood sting videos, the headline for the outlet warned.
[00:53:12.411 --> 00:53:16.753]  Because journalists are the fourth of state.
[00:53:17.950 --> 00:53:21.332]  They are protected as a check and balance.
[00:53:21.332 --> 00:53:21.992]  But not anymore.
[00:53:21.992 --> 00:53:35.679]  Vice President and Senior Counsel at the Thomas More Society, Peter Breen, who is part of the legal team, blasted the case.
[00:53:35.679 --> 00:53:40.462]  This decision to deny his client's review means that California Attorney General
[00:53:41.932 --> 00:53:53.102]  And Planned Parenthood's prosecutor-in-chief will be able to continue his unconstitutional harassment of David, bringing charges against him that don't pass the red face test.
[00:53:53.102 --> 00:53:54.443]  And it goes on from there.
[00:53:54.443 --> 00:53:56.925]  But these are heroes, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:54:00.014 --> 00:54:02.035]  Meanwhile, look at Democrat-run cities.
[00:54:02.035 --> 00:54:17.760]  Highest infant mortality, highest crime rates, four to one, sewage running down the streets, homeless everywhere, drug dealing authorized by the police departments, highest levels.
[00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:19.361]  I've talked to police in Los Angeles.
[00:54:19.361 --> 00:54:22.162]  I've talked to police in Seattle.
[00:54:22.162 --> 00:54:23.662]  I've talked to police in Portland.
[00:54:23.662 --> 00:54:25.443]  Hell, you've seen police chiefs!
[00:54:26.420 --> 00:54:32.385]  In places like Portland, say, Democratic Party policies are what are doing this to the city.
[00:54:32.385 --> 00:54:34.427]  And he said, I'm not a Republican.
[00:54:34.427 --> 00:54:38.150]  But he said the Democratic Party is out of control.
[00:54:38.150 --> 00:54:42.874]  And they won't let us do anything to stop what's happening.
[00:54:42.874 --> 00:54:46.136]  And it's getting worse.
[00:54:46.136 --> 00:54:48.238]  It's just incredible, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:54:48.238 --> 00:54:50.600]  And it's getting worse by the minute.
[00:54:50.600 --> 00:54:54.023]  Because they want to bring down civilization.
[00:54:54.023 --> 00:54:54.884]  Because they're evil.
[00:54:55.794 --> 00:54:58.495]  Because they can consolidate power during it.
[00:54:58.495 --> 00:55:02.257]  We're going to go to break, come back with the latest on China.
[00:55:02.257 --> 00:55:06.580]  Trump is also waking up that Fox News is now turning against him ahead of the election.
[00:55:06.580 --> 00:55:07.360]  That's coming up.
[00:55:07.360 --> 00:55:09.181]  So much critical intel.
[00:55:09.181 --> 00:55:13.643]  Geologist says Yellowstone eruption would destroy most of the United States.
[00:55:13.643 --> 00:55:17.785]  In fact, you can pull up previous Yellowstone eruption maps of the U.S.
[00:55:17.785 --> 00:55:20.747]  and it covers almost the entire United States.
[00:55:22.822 --> 00:55:24.724]  And signs are it's getting ready to blow.
[00:55:24.724 --> 00:55:26.746]  That story's up on NewsWars.com.
[00:55:26.746 --> 00:55:28.708]  Get it out to everyone you know.
[00:55:28.708 --> 00:55:36.336]  That said, we are launching one of the biggest sales ever on these key particular products.
[00:55:36.336 --> 00:55:38.017]  This is a huge sale.
[00:55:38.017 --> 00:55:41.000]  We're introducing the InfoWarsTore.com Memorial Day Mega Sale.
[00:55:42.014 --> 00:55:46.077]  Now is the most important time ever to support the import and get great products.
[00:55:46.077 --> 00:55:50.640]  The Memorial Day is extendo-wise, it's so good for your cardiovascular, your heart and more.
[00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:59.127]  60% off MycoZx, that is the ultimate probiotic, and then it knocks out the yeast, candida, mold, that's the whole other side of the equation.
[00:55:59.127 --> 00:56:02.709]  MycoZx, plus, that's 60% off, 50% off the new 8-pack PowerStack,
[00:56:08.123 --> 00:56:11.428]  And I don't have time to get into that, folks, but it's our newest product.
[00:56:11.428 --> 00:56:18.077]  Next to DNA Force Plus, it has the most product in it.
[00:56:18.077 --> 00:56:23.485]  No one, and I set out with, as you know, we use top manufacturers so they're the cleanest, they're the best.
[00:56:24.645 --> 00:56:27.868]  They already have the highest testing, highest ratings, so we know we're targets.
[00:56:27.868 --> 00:56:29.889]  We know we're going to be targeted by the establishment.
[00:56:29.889 --> 00:56:34.673]  We want to have the best because of that, and we want it to be great for you, so you love it.
[00:56:34.673 --> 00:56:44.140]  But quite frankly, all my funding problems would be solved if I dumbed the products down like everybody else does, or almost everybody else does, and then sold stuff for really low prices with almost nothing in them.
[00:56:45.180 --> 00:56:47.661]  Or for higher prices, nothing in them.
[00:56:47.661 --> 00:56:51.782]  This new 8-pack PowerStack is 13 pills.
[00:56:51.782 --> 00:56:53.843]  You take half in the morning, half in the evening.
[00:56:53.843 --> 00:56:56.824]  It's got two different nice packets for each day.
[00:56:56.824 --> 00:57:08.968]  And I set out to say, I want the very best, the very best cutting edge, eight new formulas inside of it, 13 pills each day.
[00:57:08.968 --> 00:57:10.089]  Everything is in there.
[00:57:10.089 --> 00:57:10.789]  It's incredible.
[00:57:12.679 --> 00:57:18.526]  And I said, I want this to have the most product of any brand out there.
[00:57:18.526 --> 00:57:26.015]  They're like, okay, there are some brands that sell for $200 a box and they've got $25 of product in them.
[00:57:26.015 --> 00:57:31.001]  And I said, I want to sell it for a hundred and I want to put way more than that.
[00:57:31.835 --> 00:57:32.935]  I go, okay.
[00:57:32.935 --> 00:57:34.816]  It's 50% off out of the gates.
[00:57:34.816 --> 00:57:35.456]  $59.95.
[00:57:35.456 --> 00:57:39.538]  No one can top the 8-pack Power Stack.
[00:57:39.538 --> 00:57:40.478]  Daily Care.
[00:57:40.478 --> 00:57:40.858]  No one.
[00:57:40.858 --> 00:57:43.839]  There's nothing better for total, complete everything.
[00:57:43.839 --> 00:57:44.700]  It's incredible.
[00:57:44.700 --> 00:57:47.461]  It's 50% off out of the gates and a bunch of other specials.
[00:57:49.192 --> 00:57:53.375]  The globalists are hyper-competitive scientific dictators.
[00:57:53.375 --> 00:57:54.435]  They are technocrats.
[00:57:54.435 --> 00:57:56.737]  They are control freaks in their own words.
[00:57:56.737 --> 00:58:04.081]  And they believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own decisions is in the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[00:58:04.081 --> 00:58:05.962]  Now, we're fighting them hard in cyberspace.
[00:58:05.962 --> 00:58:08.064]  We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension.
[00:58:08.564 --> 00:58:14.907]  One of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[00:58:14.907 --> 00:58:20.089]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from 4warslife.com, I couldn't do it.
[00:58:20.089 --> 00:58:29.114]  That's why we decided to take our original Secret 12 that was incredibly high quality medical bottlemen and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.
[00:58:30.094 --> 00:58:36.081]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12 over-the-counter that you're going to find anywhere.
[00:58:36.081 --> 00:58:37.022]  It is amazing.
[00:58:37.022 --> 00:58:47.033]  Experience pure Methylcobalamin B12 for yourself and fund the second American Revolution against the tyrants at InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLive.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:58:50.276 --> 00:58:53.857]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[00:58:53.857 --> 00:58:55.638]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[00:58:55.638 --> 00:59:06.903]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[00:59:07.683 --> 00:59:16.867]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[00:59:16.867 --> 00:59:22.649]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[00:59:22.649 --> 00:59:27.931]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[00:59:27.931 --> 00:59:30.172]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[00:59:30.532 --> 00:59:32.254]  It is not an antihistamine.
[00:59:32.254 --> 00:59:42.262]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[00:59:42.262 --> 00:59:44.925]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[00:59:44.925 --> 00:59:53.392]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[00:59:53.392 --> 00:59:56.054]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:20.683 --> 01:00:23.526]  These headlines are just incredible.
[01:00:23.526 --> 01:00:23.986]  Leak!
[01:00:23.986 --> 01:00:24.987]  Secret!
[01:00:24.987 --> 01:00:28.490]  NASA plans for permanent moon base.
[01:00:28.490 --> 01:00:29.871]  That's coming up.
[01:00:29.871 --> 01:00:34.375]  Geologists say Yellowstone eruption could destroy most of the United States.
[01:00:34.375 --> 01:00:39.079]  I just want to cover these stories because it shows how volatile our atmosphere, our planet, our world is.
[01:00:41.676 --> 01:00:47.241]  I didn't really plug this properly, so I want to do it right now because it's bigger than just a plug.
[01:00:47.241 --> 01:00:49.263]  It's something that needs to be said.
[01:00:49.263 --> 01:00:55.008]  It's something that needs to be really explained and broken down.
[01:00:55.008 --> 01:01:01.875]  There's a big article out today dealing with journalists charged with 15 felonies for undercover video.
[01:01:03.126 --> 01:01:07.669]  Exposing Planned Parenthood, and they've taken a hit in California court.
[01:01:07.669 --> 01:01:16.336]  Cases against them and others for exposing apparent crimes have been thrown out in Texas and other states, but not in California.
[01:01:16.336 --> 01:01:21.180]  And even the Los Angeles Times has said what they did was legal and lawful.
[01:01:21.180 --> 01:01:28.145]  The prosecutor is acting like a total and complete, absolute thug.
[01:01:32.412 --> 01:02:00.561]  Again, that's the attitude of the left, is to just blast past our laws, our systems, our checks and balances, our whistleblowers, our First Amendment, and to call for violence against anything seen as traditional, or anything Americana, and to ally with the most vitriolic, tribal,
[01:02:01.852 --> 01:02:06.473]  Backward Stone Age forms of Islam.
[01:02:06.473 --> 01:02:09.694]  And that's what this comes down to.
[01:02:09.694 --> 01:02:15.796]  Just earlier, I was going over some of those reports.
[01:02:15.796 --> 01:02:19.657]  And I'll go over more of those coming up in the next segment.
[01:02:19.657 --> 01:02:26.178]  But, you know, really the point I'm trying to get at is this.
[01:02:26.178 --> 01:02:28.119]  We are under massive social engineering.
[01:02:30.188 --> 01:02:32.670]  And I know everybody pretty much gets that.
[01:02:32.670 --> 01:02:47.462]  But the reason the establishment wants me off the air is because we have a fighting spirit and we believe we can change things.
[01:02:47.462 --> 01:02:52.246]  And we've done that thanks to the audience that's taken action.
[01:02:52.246 --> 01:02:55.329]  And so we're really a blueprint for a success story.
[01:02:56.807 --> 01:03:17.019]  And what I was going to do really during this little five minute segment was get into that, but I wanted to really make that point saliently and post it on the website later as a call to action.
[01:03:17.019 --> 01:03:22.903]  But due to whatever's happening in the environment, almost everyone I know in Texas
[01:03:25.523 --> 01:03:39.472]  When they go outside, coughs continually with not just the pollen that's in the air, but the jet stream dumps in from 35,000 feet to about 5,000 feet or less right over Texas.
[01:03:39.472 --> 01:03:44.415]  And the last place the jet stream dips in is China.
[01:03:44.415 --> 01:03:53.761]  So the real reason that I would advise people actually not to move to Texas, and I'm gonna be doing more reports on this in the future, is that it's not just New California,
[01:03:55.632 --> 01:04:00.674]  But we are basically the toilet bowl of China.
[01:04:00.674 --> 01:04:03.975]  No environmental standards, no smokestacks, no scrubbers.
[01:04:03.975 --> 01:04:06.996]  Everything is shot directly into the atmosphere.
[01:04:06.996 --> 01:04:17.600]  And in some sick twist of fate, I guess that's the way God set it up, that the globalists have exploited China and their people, so they're having to breathe this stuff.
[01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:22.422]  So, so do we right here in Texas.
[01:04:22.422 --> 01:04:23.142]  But I really have
[01:04:25.703 --> 01:04:28.905]  Seriously considered moving to Montana or Wyoming, this whole operation.
[01:04:28.905 --> 01:04:32.967]  Because there's really not a lot of toxic stuff there, compared to that.
[01:04:32.967 --> 01:04:36.128]  But this is not just allergies, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:04:36.128 --> 01:04:42.432]  The 5G, the 4G, the 3G, the GMO, all of it triggers your immune system.
[01:04:42.432 --> 01:04:43.672]  Your body's fighting.
[01:04:43.672 --> 01:04:47.934]  When more and more of it pumps in, your body finally gives up.
[01:04:47.934 --> 01:04:51.616]  And when your immune system gives up, if you've got allergies, you ought to be happy.
[01:04:51.616 --> 01:04:53.597]  Because if you don't, it means your body might have given up.
[01:04:53.597 --> 01:04:54.538]  You might be getting ready to die.
[01:04:58.690 --> 01:05:06.778]  Our powerful line of fluoride-free products is the perfect gift for yourself or others who are exploring a healthier, happier lifestyle.

[01:06:04.454 --> 01:06:09.474]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[01:06:36.548 --> 01:06:38.369]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us.
[01:06:38.369 --> 01:06:41.811]  It's hour number two coming up.
[01:06:41.811 --> 01:06:49.294]  Trump is finally figuring out the Republican establishment is planning to betray him and our populist movement in 2020.
[01:06:49.294 --> 01:06:57.138]  And that Fox News is rigging debates, rigging polls, and other events against him.
[01:06:57.138 --> 01:06:59.379]  Obviously.
[01:06:59.379 --> 01:07:03.801]  And I know for a fact that there's a litmus test going on at Fox News.
[01:07:05.140 --> 01:07:10.822]  on whether people will accept the removal of President Trump or not.
[01:07:10.822 --> 01:07:14.243]  That is coming up in the next segment.
[01:07:14.243 --> 01:07:16.904]  Trump hits Fox News at PA Rally.
[01:07:16.904 --> 01:07:19.385]  Something very strange is going on.
[01:07:19.385 --> 01:07:22.146]  I'll tell everybody exactly what's going on.
[01:07:22.146 --> 01:07:25.407]  I'm sure most of you have already figured it out.
[01:07:25.407 --> 01:07:29.709]  Also, the SAT adversity score
[01:07:30.828 --> 01:07:33.830]  Merits of failing grade.
[01:07:33.830 --> 01:07:37.013]  That's right, getting rid of scores is what's happening.
[01:07:37.013 --> 01:07:40.175]  A geologist says Yellowstone eruption will destroy most of the United States.
[01:07:40.175 --> 01:07:40.896]  We'll get to that.
[01:07:40.896 --> 01:07:44.779]  NASA plans for permanent lunar outposts.
[01:07:44.779 --> 01:07:49.623]  37 rocket launchers to the moon leaked online.
[01:07:49.623 --> 01:07:56.168]  We're going to get into this and so much more coming up in this hour.
[01:07:56.168 --> 01:07:58.810]  Your phone calls as well.
[01:07:58.810 --> 01:07:59.270]  But first,
[01:08:00.521 --> 01:08:06.245]  Nothing is as telltale as what the Bible said.
[01:08:06.245 --> 01:08:07.686]  In fact, can we look up the verse?
[01:08:07.686 --> 01:08:10.668]  I know it's in the Bible a couple times.
[01:08:10.668 --> 01:08:19.835]  In fact, isn't it in red in the New Testament that Christ said, you judge a tree by its fruits?
[01:08:19.835 --> 01:08:28.842]  And there's other examples in the Bible where common sense, you judge a tree by the amount of fruit it produces and how does that fruit taste?
[01:08:28.842 --> 01:08:29.142]  Every
[01:08:30.589 --> 01:08:46.882]  Every liberal leftist city, every liberal leftist state, every liberal leftist town that's been under their control for more than 10 years implodes into a cesspit.
[01:08:46.882 --> 01:08:53.167]  And a lot of times the left, like Locust, will leave one area they've destroyed, run it into the ground, bankrupted everything,
[01:08:54.076 --> 01:09:01.141]  Then they'll move to a conservative area, take it over, and there'll be a transitional period of 20 years.
[01:09:01.141 --> 01:09:07.706]  10 years while they're taking over, and then 10 years to pump and dump and run it into the ground.
[01:09:07.706 --> 01:09:09.628]  They're already setting Austin up to bankrupt.
[01:09:09.628 --> 01:09:12.470]  There's already shanty towns and feces everywhere.
[01:09:12.470 --> 01:09:14.071]  Crime is already exploding.
[01:09:14.071 --> 01:09:16.693]  Everyone I know wants to move out.
[01:09:16.693 --> 01:09:21.497]  Then the thinkers and the workers leave.
[01:09:21.497 --> 01:09:22.598]  Then the system implodes.
[01:09:24.738 --> 01:09:25.659]  And the left knows this.
[01:09:25.659 --> 01:09:28.963]  That's why they always try to build entertainment districts and things like that.
[01:09:28.963 --> 01:09:38.054]  But no one wants to come to it once it's nothing but a bunch of leftists and homeless wandering around injecting heroin, defecating on the ground.
[01:09:38.054 --> 01:09:41.578]  So it's a very, very sad progression that it goes through.
[01:09:41.578 --> 01:09:42.980]  It's the same in Europe.
[01:09:42.980 --> 01:09:43.981]  It's the same everywhere.
[01:09:44.895 --> 01:09:48.577]  The left-hand path leads to destruction.
[01:09:48.577 --> 01:09:54.661]  My God, I went and saw that film, Hail Satan, last week with the American Satanic Temple Group.
[01:09:54.661 --> 01:09:56.522]  And of course, they're real Satanists.
[01:09:56.522 --> 01:09:58.163]  They tell you they're not, but they are.
[01:09:58.163 --> 01:10:00.044]  Later, they actually admit they are.
[01:10:00.044 --> 01:10:04.246]  And if you look at them, they look like they had their souls sucked out.
[01:10:04.246 --> 01:10:05.087]  They look ugly.
[01:10:05.087 --> 01:10:06.027]  They look stupid.
[01:10:06.027 --> 01:10:07.728]  They look deformed.
[01:10:07.728 --> 01:10:10.870]  They look totally unhappy.
[01:10:10.870 --> 01:10:11.771]  They're just in hell.
[01:10:16.601 --> 01:10:18.602]  There it is, Luke 43.
[01:10:18.602 --> 01:10:26.387]  For a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit, neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.
[01:10:26.387 --> 01:10:29.529]  So you judge a tree by its fruits.
[01:10:29.529 --> 01:10:33.371]  For every tree is known by its own fruit.
[01:10:33.371 --> 01:10:39.995]  For of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes.
[01:10:41.164 --> 01:10:47.270]  A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good.
[01:10:47.270 --> 01:10:52.835]  And an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil.
[01:10:52.835 --> 01:10:57.359]  For the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh.
[01:10:59.025 --> 01:11:05.488]  So you ask, why everywhere does the left lust after brainwashing and sexualizing children?
[01:11:05.488 --> 01:11:07.989]  Why do they lust after breaking up the family?
[01:11:07.989 --> 01:11:10.350]  Why do they lust after creating crime?
[01:11:10.350 --> 01:11:13.091]  Why do they lust after attacking Christians?
[01:11:13.091 --> 01:11:15.352]  Why do they lust after abortion?
[01:11:15.352 --> 01:11:15.752]  Why?
[01:11:15.752 --> 01:11:18.993]  Because it's the abundance of their heart.
[01:11:18.993 --> 01:11:20.094]  It is spiritual.
[01:11:20.974 --> 01:11:22.854]  It is an operating system.
[01:11:22.854 --> 01:11:24.335]  It is a trance.
[01:11:24.335 --> 01:11:25.735]  It is a program.
[01:11:25.735 --> 01:11:28.436]  Call it a program in the modern parlance.
[01:11:28.436 --> 01:11:30.936]  Call it a spell in the ancient.
[01:11:30.936 --> 01:11:32.396]  Put a spell on you.
[01:11:32.396 --> 01:11:37.777]  Countries and civilizations go under mass psychosis.
[01:11:37.777 --> 01:11:45.599]  And if you have leaders pushing the psychosis, once you get people to go a few degrees past their conscience and to give up on God's operating system,
[01:11:47.745 --> 01:11:55.272]  They degrade to the very lowest common denominator, black pyramids eating babies.
[01:11:55.272 --> 01:11:59.637]  Every culture builds black pyramids and then starts murdering babies.
[01:11:59.637 --> 01:12:04.421]  That's the spirit, the wavelength, whatever you want to say it is.
[01:12:04.421 --> 01:12:08.565]  Every culture, black pyramids.
[01:12:08.565 --> 01:12:11.008]  In fact, finally they start killing their own children.
[01:12:12.213 --> 01:12:14.014]  And then societies collapse.
[01:12:14.014 --> 01:12:20.196]  The final equation, the priest class kills the young priest and then slits their own throats.
[01:12:20.196 --> 01:12:24.317]  That's the satanic program.
[01:12:24.317 --> 01:12:27.098]  I mean, how many Roman emperors committed suicide?
[01:12:27.098 --> 01:12:29.219]  This is the final thing.
[01:12:29.219 --> 01:12:38.922]  And at the end, Roman emperors were engaged in human sacrifice themselves.
[01:12:38.922 --> 01:12:41.263]  This is what happens over and over again.
[01:12:41.263 --> 01:12:41.603]  Nero,
[01:12:42.947 --> 01:13:03.392]  Would dress as a werewolf, this is in mainline history, Roman histories, and they would chain a young boy to a pillar around the dining feast while they're all sitting around on their rugs, and he would come in dressed like a werewolf and rip the young boy's throat out and then have blood spray in his face.
[01:13:03.392 --> 01:13:08.693]  So, out of the abundance of their heart,
[01:13:10.891 --> 01:13:12.372]  Out of the abundance of their heart.
[01:13:12.372 --> 01:13:17.496]  Remember what the convicted murderer said with Desmond is Amazing?
[01:13:17.496 --> 01:13:25.623]  He said, listen kids, if your parents are watching this, bring the children closer so that we can corrupt them.
[01:13:25.623 --> 01:13:30.927]  And then his partner goes, ha ha ha.
[01:13:30.927 --> 01:13:31.607]  That wasn't acting.
[01:13:38.029 --> 01:13:40.751]  And when they're done, they'll take everything you've got.
[01:13:40.751 --> 01:13:45.474]  Your honor, your will, your courage, and you'll be like one of them.
[01:13:45.474 --> 01:13:47.055]  Their shoulders are always down.
[01:13:47.055 --> 01:13:54.560]  They always rock around going... Like zombies in a movie.
[01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:56.081]  And you go look at those devil worshippers.
[01:13:57.168 --> 01:13:59.249]  And hell, Satan, they're the lowest of the low type.
[01:13:59.249 --> 01:14:10.992]  They're all super weak, hunchbacked, skinny, trying to look... They're all too lazy to clean plaque off their teeth.
[01:14:10.992 --> 01:14:16.654]  And again, it's the worship of weakness, the worship of fallenness.
[01:14:16.654 --> 01:14:19.294]  And they're going to take you with them.
[01:14:19.294 --> 01:14:21.635]  They're going to get you.
[01:14:21.635 --> 01:14:24.576]  Unless you realize who they are,
[01:14:25.478 --> 01:14:30.000]  And what they are, and don't virtue signal to them.
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.221]  Don't try to appease them.
[01:14:32.221 --> 01:14:36.143]  Don't care about them.
[01:14:36.143 --> 01:14:38.284]  And they're cowards, too.
[01:14:38.284 --> 01:14:42.046]  You gotta know when to hold them, know when to fold them, but when they confront you, it's good to let them know.
[01:14:42.046 --> 01:14:44.368]  You're fallen, ugly trash.
[01:14:44.368 --> 01:14:45.048]  You're failed.
[01:14:45.048 --> 01:14:46.188]  Go back to your God.
[01:14:46.188 --> 01:14:47.049]  Get behind me, Satan.
[01:14:48.459 --> 01:14:50.421]  Because they are gone.
[01:14:50.421 --> 01:14:56.405]  Their only vision is your children and destroying the Earth's potential.
[01:14:56.405 --> 01:15:02.330]  They believe that they can attain something if they can destroy the planet before we go to launch phase.
[01:15:03.564 --> 01:15:10.409]  And they are just an intergalactic demonic transmission spewed out of hell, trying to bring the planet down before the next level.
[01:15:10.409 --> 01:15:13.911]  But we will make the jump, and nothing's going to stop it.
[01:15:13.911 --> 01:15:16.713]  Most people aren't going to make it, but it's not going to matter.
[01:15:16.713 --> 01:15:21.396]  We are already moving into jump position, and the enemy knows it.
[01:15:21.396 --> 01:15:27.560]  And we're going to have a pro-human future, and we're not just going to go to the stars, we're going to go interdimensional.
[01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:29.942]  We're not just going interstellar, we're going interdimensional.
[01:15:30.928 --> 01:15:35.170]  As we travel up this true stairway to heaven, each new challenge.
[01:15:35.170 --> 01:15:37.350]  People won't want to play video games anymore.
[01:15:37.350 --> 01:15:40.692]  They'll realize this is the real universe with the real levels.
[01:15:40.692 --> 01:15:43.033]  This is where you want to get that score.
[01:15:43.033 --> 01:15:46.194]  Not in Super Mario Brother, not in Donkey Kong.
[01:15:46.194 --> 01:15:47.414]  We'll be right back.
[01:15:47.414 --> 01:15:54.257]  I'm Alex Jones, transmitting from the third dimension, planet Earth, two-thirds of the way out on the spiral arm, Milky Way Galaxy.
[01:15:57.836 --> 01:16:02.919]  Fellow Patriots, my name is Todd Savage, founder of BlackRifleRealEstate.com.
[01:16:02.919 --> 01:16:08.263]  Like you, I was a prisoner of the Alt-Left Sanctuary State until one day I chose to leave my family to freedom.

[01:16:57.236 --> 01:16:58.458]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[01:16:58.458 --> 01:17:02.384]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[01:17:02.384 --> 01:17:03.926]  I sued the IRS and won.
[01:17:03.926 --> 01:17:06.890]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[01:17:06.890 --> 01:17:12.078]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[01:17:12.418 --> 01:17:13.618]  I can help you too.
[01:17:13.618 --> 01:17:16.559]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[01:17:16.559 --> 01:17:18.779]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[01:17:18.779 --> 01:17:23.220]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, DanPilla.com.

[01:18:07.594 --> 01:18:16.597]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[01:18:16.597 --> 01:18:26.659]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[01:18:26.659 --> 01:18:35.202]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink, pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[01:18:36.042 --> 01:18:37.383]  There's nothing else like it.
[01:18:37.383 --> 01:18:38.543]  You must experience it.
[01:18:38.543 --> 01:18:40.504]  It is a total game-changer.
[01:18:40.504 --> 01:18:45.547]  And it comes in easy-to-use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[01:18:45.547 --> 01:18:47.068]  Warning though, it's very, very strong.
[01:18:47.068 --> 01:18:48.549]  It lasts 10 hours.
[01:18:48.549 --> 01:18:55.232]  So take a half packet the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.
[01:18:55.232 --> 01:18:56.733]  TurboForce at EnforcedLife.com.
[01:18:59.156 --> 01:19:06.563]  What you have witnessed is the biggest development in free speech in the western world's history.
[01:19:06.563 --> 01:19:10.847]  This is a digital, AI-enforced, gag order.
[01:19:10.847 --> 01:19:14.550]  Not to say the name Alex Jones or Infowars.com.
[01:19:20.216 --> 01:19:21.917]  This is Nazi Germany level.
[01:19:21.917 --> 01:19:23.137]  This is racketeering.
[01:19:23.137 --> 01:19:24.258]  This is cartels.
[01:19:24.258 --> 01:19:26.679]  Mr. President, we need your help.
[01:19:26.679 --> 01:19:28.540]  We need it now.
[01:19:28.540 --> 01:19:30.241]  You can take on Big Ten.
[01:19:30.241 --> 01:19:39.185]  They saw Infowars as a dominant, independent, anti-war, pro-human, pro-sovereign, pro-family, populist organization.
[01:19:39.185 --> 01:19:47.228]  So they thought, first they come for Alex Jones, then when people say, okay, take him off the air, everyone else like dominoes would fall.
[01:19:47.228 --> 01:19:48.089]  The way to fight back
[01:19:48.729 --> 01:19:53.576]  It's to support Infowars now more than ever and make it a standard of freedom and free speech.
[01:19:53.576 --> 01:20:01.347]  Understand that they believe they can take us down, they'll take everybody else down.
[01:20:01.347 --> 01:20:03.970]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:21.760]  You found it.
[01:20:21.760 --> 01:20:29.623]  The tip of the spear.
[01:20:29.623 --> 01:20:33.205]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:20:33.205 --> 01:20:38.327]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:38.327 --> 01:20:39.607]  All right, welcome back.
[01:20:39.607 --> 01:20:45.049]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this live Tuesday, May 21st, 2019 Global Transmission.
[01:20:45.049 --> 01:20:45.550]  Count Dankula
[01:20:50.342 --> 01:20:52.343]  is going to be joining us.
[01:20:52.343 --> 01:20:54.164]  He has been put in jail.
[01:20:54.164 --> 01:21:02.208]  He's facing more prison time for having his pug do a Hitler salute as a joke.
[01:21:02.208 --> 01:21:05.230]  Now again, I'm going to explain something here.
[01:21:05.230 --> 01:21:09.732]  This is critical.
[01:21:09.732 --> 01:21:18.457]  These gangsters, these psychological terrorists, these bullies, have almost every comedian I know or watch and other political pundits
[01:21:19.964 --> 01:21:31.687]  Seeding the moral high ground of the establishment to the left, as if these monsters, as if these authoritarian bullies, deserve that, or as if anyone deserves that.
[01:21:31.687 --> 01:21:33.728]  They're the threat.
[01:21:33.728 --> 01:21:44.150]  Because everybody I know, and people I like, from Joe Rogan to you name it, they're like, oh, Count Dankula doesn't deserve to go to jail.
[01:21:44.150 --> 01:21:46.331]  He wasn't really meaning
[01:21:47.182 --> 01:21:49.925]  To be pro-Hitler when he had the dog do Heil Hitler.
[01:22:02.338 --> 01:22:09.279]  Famous comedians like McDonald and others that just said mild things like retarded.
[01:22:09.279 --> 01:22:13.940]  Well, retarded just means the definition of being behind.
[01:22:13.940 --> 01:22:19.221]  But the left said, well, we think that's a hurtful word, so you can't use it.
[01:22:19.221 --> 01:22:21.201]  So Norm Macdonald is now back.
[01:22:21.201 --> 01:22:22.582]  He said retarded once.
[01:22:22.582 --> 01:22:23.362]  No!
[01:22:23.362 --> 01:22:27.323]  Stop apologizing!
[01:22:27.323 --> 01:22:29.623]  The Nazis have a right to say Heil Hitler.
[01:22:32.039 --> 01:22:37.104]  You have a right to say, hail Pop-Tarts if you want.
[01:22:37.104 --> 01:22:41.969]  That's what free speech in the West is about.
[01:22:41.969 --> 01:22:46.754]  And so they shouldn't be banned even if Count Dankula was a Nazi.
[01:22:46.754 --> 01:22:51.920]  And not doing funny humor like John Cleese did.
[01:22:51.920 --> 01:22:53.722]  And like Charlie Chaplin did.
[01:22:56.277 --> 01:23:02.999]  In one of Charlie Chaplin's Hitler videos, movies from the 30s and 40s, they've got a dog howling Hitler.
[01:23:02.999 --> 01:23:09.861]  Disney has dogs and ducks in anti-Hitler propaganda.
[01:23:09.861 --> 01:23:11.861]  You can pull those up, they're online.
[01:23:11.861 --> 01:23:18.303]  Type in Disney cartoons, anti-Nazi cartoons, Disney.
[01:23:18.303 --> 01:23:22.024]  And, we love the funeral so much, and his new world order, such!
[01:23:22.024 --> 01:23:24.285]  We love the new world order!
[01:23:24.285 --> 01:23:24.525]  And it's...
[01:23:25.615 --> 01:23:30.759]  Donald Duck running around howling Hitler, making fun of Hitler.
[01:23:30.759 --> 01:23:35.122]  Because Americans believe in free speech and they also got satire.
[01:23:35.122 --> 01:23:45.409]  But even if Donald Duck wanted to howl Hitler for real, it's his right to do it.
[01:23:47.418 --> 01:23:48.218]  You understand?
[01:23:48.218 --> 01:23:49.619]  I know you understand.
[01:23:49.619 --> 01:23:55.240]  So everyone goes, oh, Alex Jones isn't really a white supremacist like they're saying.
[01:23:55.240 --> 01:23:56.420]  He shouldn't be deplatformed.
[01:23:56.420 --> 01:23:59.021]  Or Tommy Robinson.
[01:23:59.021 --> 01:24:02.322]  He's not really anti-Semitic.
[01:24:02.322 --> 01:24:06.663]  Yes, they're lying about people, but even if Tommy Robinson was a Nazi.
[01:24:08.524 --> 01:24:10.625]  Even if I was a Nazi.
[01:24:10.625 --> 01:24:12.526]  Even if Count Dankula was a Nazi.
[01:24:12.526 --> 01:24:18.969]  A failed system that ruined Europe, killed a third of the Germans, killed 20 million Russians.
[01:24:18.969 --> 01:24:21.110]  What a horrible system.
[01:24:21.110 --> 01:24:28.173]  But if somebody wants to be in to a failed, evil system, that is their right.
[01:24:28.173 --> 01:24:30.794]  If they want to be a Satanist, that's their right.
[01:24:30.794 --> 01:24:33.096]  As long as they don't act on the tenets of it.
[01:24:33.096 --> 01:24:33.816]  The real tenets.
[01:24:37.082 --> 01:24:38.822]  So think about that.
[01:24:38.822 --> 01:24:41.183]  That's coming up next hour.
[01:24:41.183 --> 01:24:43.743]  Hitler Dog's creator.
[01:24:43.743 --> 01:24:47.464]  And of course, the video got millions of views.
[01:24:47.464 --> 01:24:49.804]  You know, my YouTube channel's down.
[01:24:49.804 --> 01:24:59.386]  I don't know if we have it saved, but my late great French Bulldog captain was white and gray, but didn't have hair under his nose.
[01:24:59.386 --> 01:25:01.626]  He looked like Hitler.
[01:25:01.626 --> 01:25:06.327]  And when there was a coffee or teapot controversy from JCPenney,
[01:25:07.725 --> 01:25:15.071]  Where people thought that it did a shadow, talk about schizophrenia, of Hitler's mustache from the handle.
[01:25:15.071 --> 01:25:20.716]  They withdrew the teapot when that happened.
[01:25:20.716 --> 01:25:30.545]  And so I remember somebody pointing out, well, Captain looks like he has a Hitler mustache, so let's get rid of it.
[01:25:31.983 --> 01:25:36.726]  I made the joke, you know, let's execute the dog because he'll say he has a Hitler mustache.
[01:25:36.726 --> 01:25:40.249]  And there's a video of that somewhere online, Alex Jones and Hitler Dog.
[01:25:40.249 --> 01:25:45.112]  Will I be arrested for calling the dog Hitler?
[01:25:45.112 --> 01:25:48.975]  I think I even have the dog's arm go up and, you know, say Heil Hitler.
[01:25:48.975 --> 01:25:59.042]  Now again, what happened that John Cleese in the 70s and 80s could do his Hitler jokes, and Charlie Chaplin can do his Hitler jokes, and actually Heil Hitler himself
[01:26:00.452 --> 01:26:05.394]  But today, you can't, because these are real authoritarians.
[01:26:05.394 --> 01:26:19.560]  Even if you want to be pro-Hitler, you have to have that right, because they're always gonna project it on people, and say you don't have a right to be pro-Hitler, and then take your rights away as well.
[01:26:19.560 --> 01:26:21.201]  And then expand it out.
[01:26:21.201 --> 01:26:24.722]  I was on a Logan Paul podcast, and I said, retarded.
[01:26:24.722 --> 01:26:29.024]  And they cut it out of the podcast.
[01:26:31.340 --> 01:26:37.524]  They cut it out of the podcast.
[01:26:37.524 --> 01:26:43.727]  Retarded is just the word meaning behind.
[01:26:43.727 --> 01:26:49.251]  They're now saying don't use the word Negro.
[01:26:49.251 --> 01:26:52.212]  They're now talking about changing the name of Negro Modelo.
[01:26:52.212 --> 01:26:54.774]  Because in Spanish, Negro just means black.
[01:26:56.994 --> 01:27:06.941]  Because people go to order beer or they go to the grocery store and they're so ignorant, they're seeing Hitler mustaches and teapots and, you know, they're really concerned here.
[01:27:06.941 --> 01:27:10.104]  There's always weird white people.
[01:27:10.104 --> 01:27:13.726]  And so now, you're not supposed to use the scientific name.
[01:27:13.726 --> 01:27:16.168]  It's like homosexual, heterosexual.
[01:27:16.168 --> 01:27:22.353]  Well, the homosexuals said, we feel like you're being mean to us.
[01:27:22.353 --> 01:27:23.754]  We want you to use the word gay.
[01:27:24.730 --> 01:27:27.252]  So a word that just meant happy.
[01:27:27.252 --> 01:27:28.253]  He was a gay lad.
[01:27:28.253 --> 01:27:30.174]  It was a gay day.
[01:27:30.174 --> 01:27:36.559]  Now, they don't just remove words, they take over words.
[01:27:36.559 --> 01:27:49.108]  But it's incredible to now have the word police running around the planet
[01:27:50.034 --> 01:27:54.536]  Taking over words, destroying words, changing the meaning of words.
[01:27:54.536 --> 01:28:05.381]  And so comedians, and professors, and political leaders, and in your own daily lives, folks, don't put up with people changing the meaning of words.
[01:28:05.381 --> 01:28:08.682]  Don't let people project onto you what they're claiming.
[01:28:08.682 --> 01:28:15.145]  And understand that the black Israelites have a right to say that whites are subhuman.
[01:28:15.145 --> 01:28:17.186]  The Nazis have a right to say blacks are subhuman.
[01:28:18.709 --> 01:28:29.846]  All these little fringe groups, though, are being used by the academic police state and the leftist control system, which is truly authoritarian and Orwellian, to take all of our freedoms.
[01:28:30.805 --> 01:28:32.266]  So you don't say, hey, that's not fair.
[01:28:32.266 --> 01:28:37.972]  You know, if someone didn't mean to hurt someone's feelings, it's just a joke, you shouldn't ban their speech.
[01:28:37.972 --> 01:28:39.233]  Because that's the extension.
[01:28:39.233 --> 01:28:42.957]  If you hurt someone's feelings, you no longer have free speech.
[01:28:42.957 --> 01:28:44.078]  No!
[01:28:44.078 --> 01:28:45.799]  I have a right to offend you.
[01:28:45.799 --> 01:28:47.581]  You have a right to offend me.
[01:28:47.581 --> 01:28:50.404]  My free speech doesn't end when you're offended.
[01:28:50.404 --> 01:28:54.027]  We better use these freedoms or lose them, just like Europe did.
[01:28:54.027 --> 01:28:55.769]  We're following the exact same path.
[01:28:57.324 --> 01:29:01.345]  Stocks and options trading involves financial risk and is not suitable for all investors.
[01:29:01.345 --> 01:29:04.686]  Hey guys, it's Scott Bauer here, CEO of Prosper Trading Academy.
[01:29:04.686 --> 01:29:06.566]  Are you looking for a super hot stock tip?

[01:30:04.252 --> 01:30:06.193]  Tom in Texas, police officer on the border.
[01:30:06.193 --> 01:30:08.693]  Talks about MS-13 and more.
[01:30:08.693 --> 01:30:09.634]  Thanks for calling, Tom.
[01:30:09.634 --> 01:30:10.074]  Yes, sir.
[01:30:10.074 --> 01:30:11.374]  Thank you for taking my call.
[01:30:11.374 --> 01:30:13.475]  Just want to thank you for your products.
[01:30:13.475 --> 01:30:17.216]  I have the InfoWard decals on the outside of my cell phone case.
[01:30:17.216 --> 01:30:19.396]  My truck, sport, the shirts, all the equipment.
[01:30:19.396 --> 01:30:21.357]  I find it's the best way to get your word out.
[01:30:21.357 --> 01:30:22.297]  God bless you, brother.
[01:30:22.297 --> 01:30:25.858]  And I have three or four InfoWard bumper stickers in my glove box right now.
[01:30:25.858 --> 01:30:28.899]  I hand out if I get to talking to somebody just to help spread that
[01:30:29.319 --> 01:30:30.420]  You're our only hope, brother.
[01:30:30.420 --> 01:30:32.742]  I'm telling you, you're more important than I am.
[01:30:32.742 --> 01:30:35.484]  It's people like you on the ground, as you know, that's boots on the ground.
[01:30:59.958 --> 01:31:01.318]  Mike in New Jersey.
[01:31:01.318 --> 01:31:01.898]  You're on the air.
[01:31:01.898 --> 01:31:02.699]  Thanks for calling, Mike.
[01:31:02.699 --> 01:31:04.059]  You are the man, Alex.
[01:31:04.059 --> 01:31:05.579]  I'm so glad to be talking to you.
[01:31:05.579 --> 01:31:06.379]  I'm so excited.
[01:31:06.379 --> 01:31:07.299]  I'm such a big fan.
[01:31:07.299 --> 01:31:09.780]  Ever since I've been listening, I've been buying your products.
[01:31:09.780 --> 01:31:12.280]  I gotta do a shout-out for the Bone Broth.
[01:31:12.280 --> 01:31:13.681]  The Bone Broth.
[01:31:13.681 --> 01:31:15.121]  The Bone Broth.
[01:31:15.121 --> 01:31:16.541]  The Bone Broth.
[01:31:16.541 --> 01:31:17.781]  The Bone Broth.
[01:31:17.781 --> 01:31:20.982]  Tastes like, tastes like, um, great milkshake.
[01:31:20.982 --> 01:31:22.522]  You know, if you just add it to milk.
[01:31:22.522 --> 01:31:23.842]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[01:31:23.842 --> 01:31:25.143]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[01:31:25.143 --> 01:31:26.523]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[01:31:28.024 --> 01:31:28.504]  Good!
[01:31:28.504 --> 01:31:28.604]  Whoa!
[01:31:28.604 --> 01:31:30.326]  I feel great since I've been taking it.
[01:31:30.326 --> 01:31:34.509]  My daughter uses the Bubble Gum Fluoride Free Toothpaste.
[01:31:34.509 --> 01:31:38.293]  I've used the Super Male Vitality, a host of other products.
[01:31:38.293 --> 01:31:40.354]  So thank you so much for that as well.
[01:31:40.354 --> 01:31:42.917]  Brother, you're thanking me for buying the products and keeping us on air.
[01:31:42.917 --> 01:31:43.657]  I'm thanking you.
[01:31:43.657 --> 01:31:50.123]  But yes, this is the ultimate bone broth formula with the turmeric, the chaga mushroom, the true bone broth.
[01:31:50.123 --> 01:31:50.944]  It is next level.
[01:31:50.944 --> 01:31:51.504]  It really is good.
[01:31:51.504 --> 01:31:52.065]  So thank you.
[01:31:52.065 --> 01:31:53.986]  I feel great since I've been taking it.
[01:31:53.986 --> 01:31:54.367]  Thank you.

[01:33:12.477 --> 01:33:13.698]  You found it!
[01:33:13.698 --> 01:33:15.699]  The tip of the spear!
[01:33:15.699 --> 01:33:18.020]  It is the Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:26.863 --> 01:33:33.344]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, Bernie Sanders is set to be arrested.
[01:33:33.344 --> 01:33:34.805]  That's right.
[01:33:34.805 --> 01:33:47.067]  Under leftist thought crimes, anything that anyone is offended by is then banned.
[01:33:47.067 --> 01:33:49.487]  And then you have to have a debate about whether you really offended anybody.
[01:33:49.487 --> 01:33:52.088]  Remember Count Dankula, who's joining us the next hour.
[01:33:53.550 --> 01:34:04.433]  Did the funny viral Hitler dog video similar to Charlie Chaplin or things that John Cleese had done that was put on national television and movie theaters.
[01:34:04.433 --> 01:34:05.694]  Well, he's already been in jail.
[01:34:05.694 --> 01:34:11.595]  He's facing more jail time and giant fines because he hasn't apologized for his thought crime.
[01:34:11.595 --> 01:34:16.597]  Kind of like Twitter always wants you to delete your tweet or they'll delete your whole page.
[01:34:18.137 --> 01:34:21.059]  They make you take part in your own lynching.
[01:34:21.059 --> 01:34:23.461]  Well, the conservatives are jumping on the bandwagon.
[01:34:23.461 --> 01:34:27.284]  The American Mirror, who are great folks, have jumped on a tub.
[01:34:27.284 --> 01:34:34.030]  Bernie Sanders holds up fried chicken leg for picture with a black man in South Carolina.
[01:34:34.030 --> 01:34:38.953]  And they go on to say he better get a better black advisor.
[01:34:38.953 --> 01:34:40.875]  You know, I don't like Bernie Sanders.
[01:34:43.635 --> 01:34:54.285]  Because of his politics, because of the swindling he does, him and his wife and his family robbing college funds, nepotism, the million dollar homes, the hundred thousand dollar cars.
[01:34:54.285 --> 01:34:55.687]  They're hypocrites!
[01:34:55.687 --> 01:35:02.573]  Nothing wrong with nice homes and cars, but they say money's bad and they stole it!
[01:35:02.573 --> 01:35:07.778]  But, in the South, and most of the country, everybody likes fried chicken.
[01:35:08.772 --> 01:35:19.836]  So it's in the North when a bunch of black folks moved up there after the Civil War that Northerners had never seen fried chicken and collard greens and chicken fried steak and stuff like that.
[01:35:19.836 --> 01:35:21.377]  Poor babies.
[01:35:21.377 --> 01:35:23.338]  So they thought that's black food.
[01:35:23.338 --> 01:35:24.738]  And there's an obsession in the North.
[01:35:24.738 --> 01:35:25.899]  I love Northerners.
[01:35:25.899 --> 01:35:26.679]  But it's weird.
[01:35:26.679 --> 01:35:28.920]  I've seen it in the Midwest too.
[01:35:28.920 --> 01:35:30.741]  And out West.
[01:35:30.741 --> 01:35:36.663]  Northwest people will actually make jokes if they see you eating watermelon or fried chicken.
[01:35:39.178 --> 01:35:44.521]  And it's a weird thing where they call it soul food, and that's kind of a weird thing, you go eat the soul food.
[01:35:44.521 --> 01:35:50.445]  They don't really have southern cooking in the north, but they'll call it soul food places.
[01:35:50.445 --> 01:35:54.807]  And so it's kind of like a joke, like, oh, you're eating your fried chicken, and I'm like, you're damn right I'm eating my fried chicken.
[01:35:54.807 --> 01:35:57.169]  Just like Grandma always made it and Mama made it.
[01:35:57.169 --> 01:35:59.010]  But see the mental illness.
[01:35:59.010 --> 01:36:03.593]  There's a projection that Bernie Sanders is at a guy's restaurant,
[01:36:04.650 --> 01:36:08.591]  And he's like, this is really good chicken, and he holds it up and starts eating it.
[01:36:08.591 --> 01:36:11.472]  Bill Clinton did that and got in trouble a few years ago.
[01:36:11.472 --> 01:36:12.933]  I hate Bill Clinton.
[01:36:12.933 --> 01:36:17.115]  But they said, Bill Clinton's posing with black people with a plate of chicken.
[01:36:17.115 --> 01:36:18.815]  Bill Clinton's from Arkansas!
[01:36:18.815 --> 01:36:23.557]  He's been eating fried chicken since he was six months old!
[01:36:23.557 --> 01:36:26.178]  But again, that is the insanity of this.
[01:36:28.097 --> 01:36:30.359]  In fact, national media made a really big thing.
[01:36:30.359 --> 01:36:33.561]  It was like, Jones was in a fried chicken place!
[01:36:33.561 --> 01:36:35.082]  And they'd laugh about it.
[01:36:35.082 --> 01:36:38.665]  And like, oh, he got thrown out of a fried chicken place, which I didn't.
[01:36:38.665 --> 01:36:39.506]  The left attacked me.
[01:36:39.506 --> 01:36:40.667]  I finished.
[01:36:40.667 --> 01:36:41.067]  I left.
[01:36:41.067 --> 01:36:41.788]  They got thrown out.
[01:36:41.788 --> 01:36:46.391]  So it was that undertone of, look, he's eating fried chicken.
[01:36:46.391 --> 01:36:47.772]  Man, I tell you, it's weird.
[01:36:47.772 --> 01:36:52.556]  I love folks up north, but they'll ask me, do you ride horses to work?
[01:36:52.556 --> 01:36:53.597]  And stuff like that.
[01:36:53.597 --> 01:36:54.318]  And so there's these
[01:36:55.575 --> 01:37:18.033]  There's these stereotypes, and the reason I'm talking a lot about this is, the right wing is jumping on board now, because the left, if I went out, if I was still on Twitter, and I went to some restaurant and held up a piece of fried chicken by a black guy, they'd say, Jones does secret white supremacist, you know, signal.
[01:37:18.033 --> 01:37:21.296]  But, do we have to act like the control freak mental patient left?
[01:37:24.451 --> 01:37:29.834]  When they project onto us, if we're eating fried chicken, that it's some code word.
[01:37:29.834 --> 01:37:33.736]  Or if I buy a watermelon at the store, it's because I'm mimicking black people.
[01:37:33.736 --> 01:37:36.618]  That's insane!
[01:37:36.618 --> 01:37:40.240]  That's crazy!
[01:37:40.240 --> 01:37:44.783]  So again, it's the same thing and it shows how far they've gone.
[01:37:44.783 --> 01:37:49.666]  So now the right wing projects on Sanders that he was insensitive
[01:37:51.149 --> 01:37:56.752]  Standing by a black man in his restaurant eating a piece of his chicken.
[01:37:56.752 --> 01:37:59.493]  Holding up his product.
[01:37:59.493 --> 01:38:04.335]  Like if you went into a deli and you hold up somebody's Reuben and said, man, that's a nice Reuben.
[01:38:04.335 --> 01:38:09.158]  Or you went in a Mexican food restaurant and you had a big plate of enchiladas.
[01:38:09.158 --> 01:38:16.441]  It's like Trump on Cinco de Mayo tweeted out that Trump Hotel was serving a Cinco de Mayo taco bowl.
[01:38:17.785 --> 01:38:19.766]  I thought, mmm, taco bowl.
[01:38:19.766 --> 01:38:22.487]  People went, oh, it's a sick joke by Trump.
[01:38:22.487 --> 01:38:26.728]  No, he's saying, Cinco de Mayo, eat Mexican food.
[01:38:26.728 --> 01:38:30.049]  You know?
[01:38:30.049 --> 01:38:42.233]  Again, that's the left saying all information, all culture, everything is owned by them, and they'll tell you what you mean, and they'll tell you what you can use, and they'll tell you what you can do.
[01:38:42.233 --> 01:38:44.734]  And then conservatives try to use their own magic back at them.
[01:38:46.055 --> 01:38:50.157]  Conservatives go, okay, uh, Bernie posed with chicken!
[01:38:50.157 --> 01:38:52.538]  He's insensitive!
[01:38:52.538 --> 01:38:53.579]  And the left doesn't care.
[01:38:53.579 --> 01:38:57.120]  They go, oh, Bernie didn't mean it like that.
[01:38:57.120 --> 01:39:03.523]  So we keep trying to go along with the corporate media and the universities and these bullies by playing their political correctness game.
[01:39:03.523 --> 01:39:08.546]  Hey, Louis Farrakhan, he's still on Facebook, but all these other people aren't.
[01:39:08.546 --> 01:39:09.106]  Well, you know what?
[01:39:09.106 --> 01:39:11.647]  We'll just ban their names from it.
[01:39:11.647 --> 01:39:15.389]  And we'll ban him as a token person as well who's not a conservative.
[01:39:17.512 --> 01:39:21.415]  Bernie Sanders visited a taste of Black Columbia.
[01:39:21.415 --> 01:39:24.278]  By the way, this is making me hungry.
[01:39:24.278 --> 01:39:28.421]  I don't normally do it, and it's kind of fast food-y and probably has some bad additives.
[01:39:28.421 --> 01:39:38.809]  But I want... I want Popeye's Chicken Tenders with, uh... Yeah, that's what I want for lunch.
[01:39:38.809 --> 01:39:39.610]  I'm gonna eat that on there.
[01:39:39.610 --> 01:39:41.572]  Extra gravy.
[01:39:41.572 --> 01:39:43.994]  I'm seriously getting hungry reading this.
[01:39:43.994 --> 01:39:46.776]  Bernie Sanders visited the taste of Black... that huge tub...
[01:39:49.201 --> 01:39:53.243]  That's what I like best is drumsticks, actually.
[01:39:53.243 --> 01:39:55.405]  Side issue.
[01:39:55.405 --> 01:40:03.870]  Bernie Sanders visited a taste of black Columbia in South Carolina on Friday and posed with a black worker while holding a fried chicken leg.
[01:40:03.870 --> 01:40:07.112]  Another photo shows him biting into it.
[01:40:07.112 --> 01:40:09.874]  Oh my gosh!
[01:40:09.874 --> 01:40:14.777]  And they started tweeting, an annual showcase of local restaurants.
[01:40:16.206 --> 01:40:19.547]  Bernie Sanders needs new black advisors, he wrote.
[01:40:19.547 --> 01:40:29.970]  Yeah, you need an SJW, social justice warrior, mental patient, looking for microaggressions and looking to have a chip on their shoulder everywhere when somebody goes to somebody's restaurant and promotes their food.
[01:40:29.970 --> 01:40:33.891]  You think the guy at the restaurant, his restaurant promoted, doesn't like it?
[01:40:33.891 --> 01:40:36.072]  You don't think he likes somebody holding up their damn food and eating it?
[01:40:36.072 --> 01:40:40.813]  Because he's not a crazy person like you!
[01:40:40.813 --> 01:40:45.655]  Sanders is the first Democrat to get a pass at pandering to black people.
[01:40:47.233 --> 01:40:51.276]  That's right, if you go in a black person's restaurant and you eat there, you're pandering to them.
[01:40:51.276 --> 01:40:53.538]  It's not because the food's good.
[01:40:53.538 --> 01:40:57.021]  Think about how condescending that is.
[01:40:57.021 --> 01:41:04.487]  In 2016, Bill Clinton visited Louisville, Kentucky and visited a soul food restaurant where he served fried chicken to patrons.
[01:41:04.487 --> 01:41:06.328]  What the hell do you think they served there?
[01:41:06.328 --> 01:41:16.256]  As Saturday Morning Solutions, a weekly black radio show reported, Bill Clinton came to the hood in Louisville and literally served fried chicken to black people.
[01:41:18.171 --> 01:41:23.778]  Well, yeah, that's because he grew up around black people in High Springs.
[01:41:26.900 --> 01:41:28.381]  I mean, that is crazy.
[01:41:28.381 --> 01:41:36.405]  That's the left saying, everything is an insult, everything is an attack, everything is racist, everything is evil, because we said so.
[01:41:36.405 --> 01:41:38.727]  And that is schick.
[01:41:38.727 --> 01:41:41.608]  And that is out of control.
[01:41:41.608 --> 01:41:53.275]  So if Count Dankula got arrested for his Hitler dog as a joke, will Bernie Sanders, because I'm saying it hurt my feelings and we held up the chicken, it was a Hitler salute to put down that black man.
[01:41:54.724 --> 01:41:59.106]  And that he must have, like, drugged the black man because the black man's smiling.
[01:41:59.106 --> 01:42:03.768]  And I just want Bernie Sanders arrested for this racial insensitivity.
[01:42:03.768 --> 01:42:06.209]  Or I at least want him banned from that restaurant for life.
[01:42:06.209 --> 01:42:08.750]  Like the guy that did the OK sign at the Cubs game.
[01:42:08.750 --> 01:42:09.851]  He's banned for life.
[01:42:09.851 --> 01:42:11.071]  Thank God.
[01:42:11.071 --> 01:42:11.712]  Everything's bad.
[01:42:11.712 --> 01:42:13.953]  Fried chicken, the OK sign.
[01:42:13.953 --> 01:42:15.333]  Just everything is evil.
[01:42:15.333 --> 01:42:16.254]  Everything is bad.
[01:42:16.254 --> 01:42:17.214]  Teapots are bad.
[01:42:17.214 --> 01:42:18.155]  They look like Hitler.
[01:42:18.155 --> 01:42:21.796]  You know, if you look over the clouds, you might see Hitler and call the police.
[01:42:24.574 --> 01:42:25.884]  I just see it everywhere.
[01:42:25.884 --> 01:42:26.831]  Hitler, Hitler, everywhere.
[01:42:28.743 --> 01:42:37.447]  Okay, I kind of digressed when I told you that Count Dankula was coming up, because I've got to get to Trump figuring out that Fox News and the neocons are turning on him right now.
[01:42:37.447 --> 01:42:39.808]  I've got to get to everything today.
[01:42:39.808 --> 01:42:41.008]  I've got to get to Yellowstone.
[01:42:41.008 --> 01:42:42.989]  I've got to get to the latest on Candace Owens.
[01:42:42.989 --> 01:42:48.051]  I've got to get to the latest on the crumbling leftist systems and judging a tree by its fruit.
[01:42:48.051 --> 01:42:51.252]  I've got to cover it all, and I will.
[01:42:51.252 --> 01:42:52.933]  Straight ahead, whatever you do, spread the word.
[01:42:52.933 --> 01:42:55.574]  That's how you break the back of the censors, and I thank you.
[01:42:58.897 --> 01:43:00.404]  Okay, it's true.
[01:43:00.404 --> 01:43:01.610]  I stayed up late last night.
[01:43:56.085 --> 01:43:58.767]  They've not shut down our speech!

[01:48:31.306 --> 01:48:35.546]  I want the listeners, I want the viewers to understand something.
[01:48:35.546 --> 01:48:39.487]  When I tell you that I'm in your hands, that didn't talk.
[01:48:39.487 --> 01:48:45.248]  I am 100% in God's hands and God works through you.

[01:49:07.363 --> 01:49:09.144]  So I'll say it again.
[01:49:09.144 --> 01:49:14.546]  Do not call this show and start thanking me and telling me how great I am.
[01:49:14.546 --> 01:49:16.627]  You are awesome.
[01:49:16.627 --> 01:49:17.647]  I want to thank you.
[01:49:20.509 --> 01:49:27.916]  It'd be like if I was in a life raft in the North Atlantic, and the water's freezing cold and will kill me, and the life raft's telling me thank you constantly.
[01:49:27.916 --> 01:49:28.917]  Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[01:49:28.917 --> 01:49:31.599]  Hey, thank you!
[01:49:31.599 --> 01:49:33.841]  We're in this together.
[01:49:33.841 --> 01:49:40.327]  Airports, on the streets, you shake my hand, these great families, black, white, old, young.
[01:49:40.327 --> 01:49:42.008]  I appreciate you.
[01:49:42.008 --> 01:49:45.812]  And I thank you.
[01:49:45.812 --> 01:49:46.913]  But you have to understand,
[01:49:48.487 --> 01:50:14.783]  I was watching this morning, I don't know why it came up in my feed on the iPad, but it was like where there were videos like 5 million, 10 million views of people that can play Super Mario Brothers that I would play some when I was like 12 years old and who can do perfect pixel scores of whole levels
[01:50:19.574 --> 01:50:26.159]  Where one pixel off, you can't do it.
[01:50:26.159 --> 01:50:29.061]  And some people have to do it 10,000 times to be able to do it.
[01:50:29.061 --> 01:50:31.923]  There's only a few, some people 6,000 times.
[01:50:31.923 --> 01:50:37.447]  One guy did it the first time he tried.
[01:50:37.447 --> 01:50:41.791]  Now, that's incredibly interesting.
[01:50:41.791 --> 01:50:44.793]  Now, you wonder how the astronauts landed on the moon.
[01:50:44.793 --> 01:50:48.556]  And you wonder why the Israeli craft, the Chinese crash, because they're robots.
[01:50:49.542 --> 01:50:56.027]  And you think a robot's good, but that's because a robot's done it over and over again and has GPS.
[01:50:56.027 --> 01:50:58.508]  It's been tested over and over again.
[01:50:58.508 --> 01:51:03.812]  Those were men, basically with joysticks, just like the old Nintendo joystick they had in the 80s.
[01:51:03.812 --> 01:51:10.377]  In fact, if you look at the controllers on the Lunar Lander, it's basically a Nintendo controller.
[01:51:10.377 --> 01:51:12.679]  Everything comes out of NASA.
[01:51:12.679 --> 01:51:17.262]  And their lives are on the line, and they've done it in simulations thousands of times.
[01:51:17.262 --> 01:51:18.323]  Neil Armstrong had done it.
[01:51:19.810 --> 01:51:27.677]  Seven times on Earth, with a gravity way more powerful in the same lander, and almost every time it crash-landed.
[01:51:27.677 --> 01:51:29.078]  And they said, we're pulling the program.
[01:51:29.078 --> 01:51:31.060]  And he said, look, too many people have died.
[01:51:31.060 --> 01:51:33.382]  It's very accurate what's in that movie.
[01:51:33.382 --> 01:51:34.143]  First man.
[01:51:34.143 --> 01:51:34.683]  He goes, no.
[01:51:34.683 --> 01:51:37.225]  And they go, we've already lost too many lives, we're killing the program.
[01:51:37.225 --> 01:51:40.008]  And he says, we've already lost too many lives to stop.
[01:51:40.008 --> 01:51:41.269]  I'm going back up and I'm doing it again.
[01:51:41.269 --> 01:51:45.733]  That's why people look at it there and they go, how the hell did men back then do it?
[01:51:47.076 --> 01:51:51.278]  But they can't do it today with robots, as accurately.
[01:51:51.278 --> 01:52:00.062]  Because it was people risking their damn lives that had 170 IQs and have been fighter pilots their whole lives, who'd already gone into space in jet aircraft.
[01:52:00.062 --> 01:52:00.502]  That's why.
[01:52:00.502 --> 01:52:02.463]  Because they were badasses.
[01:52:02.463 --> 01:52:09.006]  And we look at those men, so much smarter, so much stronger than us today, and we think, that's impossible!
[01:52:09.006 --> 01:52:09.686]  There are people
[01:52:11.226 --> 01:52:14.928]  With Nintendo joysticks that can do things that robots can't do.
[01:52:14.928 --> 01:52:17.690]  They've had competitions with top robots.
[01:52:17.690 --> 01:52:21.573]  Robots can't do what humans can do with a joystick.
[01:52:21.573 --> 01:52:35.502]  You have to be so fast on those joysticks, that it was like one one hundredth of a second, and all the perfect moves to perfectly go through a game at the maximum speed you're able to, like a ballerina the entire time.
[01:52:38.650 --> 01:52:51.157]  Imagine if those young men spent their time building a business, or having a wife, or having children, or in the military, or any of that, putting that much energy into something.
[01:52:51.157 --> 01:52:57.481]  So I'm not criticizing those young men for what they do and how they spend their lives.
[01:52:57.481 --> 01:52:59.382]  That's your life.
[01:52:59.382 --> 01:53:07.647]  But to watch that level of skill flush down the toilet over a video game is sad.
[01:53:09.761 --> 01:53:15.606]  And again, supercomputers cannot do it as good as that.
[01:53:15.606 --> 01:53:20.570]  When a computer is using a joystick, over and over again, it can't beat it.
[01:53:20.570 --> 01:53:37.885]  Because it's down to hundreds of thousands of a second, because you've got to, thousands of times, make the exact right move down to milliseconds, where it's almost, it's like it's psychic, the way they're hitting those buttons, because a computer can't even do it.
[01:53:38.775 --> 01:53:40.196]  It's so perfect.
[01:53:40.196 --> 01:53:41.357]  It's such a dance.
[01:53:41.357 --> 01:53:42.698]  It's so zhenned out.
[01:53:42.698 --> 01:53:50.663]  And I remember back when I'd play games like Super Mario Brothers and Donkey Kong, but I always was going to go see a girlfriend or I had friends coming over, so I'd go maybe two hours.
[01:53:50.663 --> 01:53:58.209]  I remember trancing out playing Super Mario Brothers, you know, winning the game and always wanting to win the games.
[01:53:58.209 --> 01:54:03.593]  And I remember refusing to use the cheats because everybody would learn the cheats.
[01:54:03.593 --> 01:54:05.314]  You learn a little secret cheats and all that stuff.
[01:54:06.940 --> 01:54:15.665]  But one, and I remember like zoning out, and then two hours later winning a game or winning a level, and then just being like a zombie.
[01:54:15.665 --> 01:54:22.310]  But I remember going into a trance, like a fighter pilot's talk about doing, and then going out of the trance when the game was over.
[01:54:22.310 --> 01:54:28.814]  These have all been designed to manipulate your dopamine and to addict you, just like the cell phones, just like all of it, they admit it.
[01:54:29.639 --> 01:54:40.202]  But then in the real world, you're not happy anymore because it's not delivering dopamine that fast unless you're a fighter pilot or unless you're actually landing on the moon.
[01:54:40.202 --> 01:54:54.006]  And so, yeah, what do you think it was when Neil Armstrong wanted to get back in lunar landers on Earth, take off, fly out a mile, and then do the descent back as he would have to do in the real world?
[01:54:54.006 --> 01:54:54.907]  Was it seven times?
[01:54:54.907 --> 01:54:55.887]  He almost got killed doing it.
[01:54:57.847 --> 01:55:08.715]  So again, they've designed all this knowing what you like to do, knowing what you like to execute, knowing what you like to carry out.
[01:55:08.715 --> 01:55:18.503]  But instead of knowing just how to prune the plant and grow it and just how to water it and just when to bring the crops in and all those things that would really fulfill you, because it's a video game,
[01:55:20.134 --> 01:55:23.817]  To go out and plant crops or cut crops or do those things.
[01:55:23.817 --> 01:55:26.139]  You think it's work, you actually zone out when you're doing it.
[01:55:26.139 --> 01:55:32.264]  Because you're designed, dopamine level, to climb up in an apple tree and pick apples.
[01:55:32.264 --> 01:55:33.946]  You're designed to cook dinner.
[01:55:33.946 --> 01:55:35.507]  You're designed to sweep the floor.
[01:55:35.507 --> 01:55:37.409]  You're designed to have sex with your wife.
[01:55:37.409 --> 01:55:39.751]  You're designed to knit your clothes.
[01:55:39.751 --> 01:55:43.093]  You're designed to build everything around you.
[01:55:43.093 --> 01:55:48.138]  And instead, the globalists have bragged in white papers, they give you little facsimiles
[01:55:49.502 --> 01:55:51.284]  Prosthetics!
[01:55:51.284 --> 01:55:55.407]  Instead of having sex with a real woman, it's the equivalent of having sex with a blow-up doll.
[01:55:55.407 --> 01:55:58.970]  That's a prosthetic, or a fake limb.
[01:55:58.970 --> 01:56:00.271]  But it doesn't even help you walk.
[01:56:00.271 --> 01:56:01.693]  It doesn't even get you there.
[01:56:01.693 --> 01:56:03.875]  It takes your humanity away.
[01:56:03.875 --> 01:56:06.277]  It removes you out of your humanity.
[01:56:06.277 --> 01:56:08.799]  It makes you weaker, not stronger.
[01:56:11.112 --> 01:56:13.854]  And it was designed to do that.
[01:56:13.854 --> 01:56:15.716]  So the men don't want families.
[01:56:15.716 --> 01:56:17.277]  The men don't want children.
[01:56:17.277 --> 01:56:19.138]  The men don't want to go mountain climbing.
[01:56:19.138 --> 01:56:20.820]  The men don't want to go hunting.
[01:56:20.820 --> 01:56:31.768]  The men want to sit in rooms with other men watching them, showing them how they can beat supercomputers playing a video game.
[01:56:31.768 --> 01:56:33.790]  But the supercomputer is running it now.
[01:56:35.069 --> 01:56:40.697]  And it sucked you in with its tentacles and it knows how to mesmerize you and control you.
[01:56:40.697 --> 01:56:43.922]  And gamers will always get real mad and go, don't you tell me what to do!
[01:56:43.922 --> 01:56:45.884]  I'm like, hey, you have your speech.
[01:56:45.884 --> 01:56:46.305]  I have mine.
[01:56:46.305 --> 01:56:50.511]  I'm not trying to take your girlfriend away from you, your cell phone, your video game.
[01:56:50.811 --> 01:57:01.119]  Your life, where you're comfortable, a place you're competent, a false reality built by someone else to control your life, to make sure you never amount to anything.
[01:57:01.119 --> 01:57:12.448]  That's what the designers and the globalists said all of this was about, was a snare for the post-human world that has now been set up for you.
[01:57:12.448 --> 01:57:13.529]  I gotta end this hour.
[01:57:13.529 --> 01:57:15.551]  If you don't financially support us, we won't be here.
[01:57:16.337 --> 01:57:20.359]  We've got the new specials that are running, new huge specials.

[01:57:47.361 --> 01:57:50.384]  Everybody knows that supplements are amazing.
[01:57:50.384 --> 01:57:52.967]  That what God gave us from Mother Nature is incredible.
[01:57:52.967 --> 01:57:55.750]  That's why supplements are the biggest growing industry in the world.
[01:57:55.750 --> 01:57:57.732]  And the globalists are so upset.
[01:57:57.732 --> 01:58:00.555]  The problem is, people forget to take them.
[01:58:01.806 --> 01:58:06.871]  And that's why the whole industry has moved towards packets you take in the morning and you take at night.
[01:58:06.871 --> 01:58:07.852]  So we looked at that.
[01:58:07.852 --> 01:58:09.473]  We made the very best a.m.

[01:59:51.880 --> 01:59:54.503]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:10.166 --> 02:00:18.630]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:18.630 --> 02:00:24.413]  Well, the incredibly evil thought criminal, Count Bankula, is going to be joining us.
[02:00:24.413 --> 02:00:25.493]  He spent time in jail.
[02:00:25.493 --> 02:00:28.655]  They're still trying to prosecute him for Hitler Dog.
[02:00:29.557 --> 02:00:34.922]  Will they arrest John Cleese next or dig up the body, exhume the body of Charlie Chaplin?
[02:00:34.922 --> 02:00:44.212]  But he's been out there covering the leftist riots, the brick attacks, the milkshake attacks, and the praise of the attacks being launched everywhere.
[02:00:44.212 --> 02:00:49.877]  So we're going to go to this report when this saga started a couple years ago from Paul Watson.
[02:00:50.936 --> 02:00:57.265]  Where the British police are now, the UK police are now arresting people for their comedic jokes.
[02:00:57.265 --> 02:01:01.652]  Here is that report, bringing you up to speed before Count Dankula joins us next segment.
[02:01:03.200 --> 02:01:11.383]  28-year-old Marcus Meacham was arrested for hate crimes after posting this joke video of his girlfriend's dog reacting to Nazi slogans.
[02:01:11.383 --> 02:01:18.206]  My girlfriend is always ranting and raving about how cute and adorable her wee dog is.
[02:01:18.206 --> 02:01:25.809]  And so I thought I would turn them into the least cute thing that I could think of, which is a Nazi.
[02:01:25.809 --> 02:01:27.050]  Buddha!
[02:01:27.050 --> 02:01:30.872]  Do you wanna gas the Jews?
[02:01:30.872 --> 02:01:31.472]  Gas the Jews?
[02:01:34.360 --> 02:01:36.566]  Tschüss!
[02:01:36.566 --> 02:01:37.409]  Sieg Heil!
[02:01:37.409 --> 02:01:39.193]  Tschüss!
[02:01:49.989 --> 02:01:55.474]  The video went viral, receiving 18,000 thumbs up to just 1,200 thumbs down.
[02:01:55.474 --> 02:02:06.103]  The vast majority of viewers thought that it was hilarious, but thanks to a small minority of perpetually offended retards, Meechan got a home visit from the Scottish police.
[02:02:06.103 --> 02:02:14.391]  Authorities said that Meechan's arrest is a lesson to others that any video content deemed offensive will not be tolerated.
[02:02:14.531 --> 02:02:21.353]  Meechan then prostrated himself, pleading that he wasn't a racist and that he only made the video to annoy his girlfriend.
[02:02:21.353 --> 02:02:26.314]  Isn't it interesting that John Cleese recently came out and decried political correctness?
[02:02:26.314 --> 02:02:32.516]  Because under that definition, Cleese himself would have been arrested for this Fawlty Towers sketch.
[02:02:32.516 --> 02:02:33.976]  Who's this then?
[02:02:33.976 --> 02:02:35.117]  Stop you, man!
[02:02:35.117 --> 02:02:39.178]  I'm gonna call him off!
[02:02:39.178 --> 02:02:40.158]  He's gone!
[02:02:44.090 --> 02:02:48.254]  He would have also been hit with hate crimes charges for this Monty Python sketch.
[02:03:00.652 --> 02:03:04.913]  Charlie Chaplin would have been thrown in a jail cell for the same reason.
[02:03:04.913 --> 02:03:12.815]  If they're now treating any video content whatsoever that causes offence as hate speech, then my entire channel is hate speech.
[02:03:12.815 --> 02:03:19.236]  It's getting close to where I'm going to have to leave the country simply to continue to make YouTube videos.
[02:03:19.236 --> 02:03:23.757]  They're already arresting people who criticise Muslim immigration on Twitter.
[02:03:23.757 --> 02:03:24.517]  Now satire?
[02:03:25.097 --> 02:03:30.201]  Frigging satire that's not even malicious will not be tolerated.
[02:03:30.201 --> 02:03:32.403]  And this is by no means a one-off case.
[02:03:32.403 --> 02:03:40.610]  Just a few days ago, a Muslim police chief in Manchester said, freedom of speech does not mean freedom of offending culture, religion or tradition.
[02:03:40.610 --> 02:03:48.276]  Just last month, Greater Glasgow Police threatened to conduct home visits to harass people who made unkind or inaccurate tweets.
[02:03:48.576 --> 02:03:55.842]  Last year, Police Scotland announced their intention to investigate offensive comments made on Twitter and other social media platforms.
[02:03:55.842 --> 02:04:00.806]  Of course, this was all selectively enforced, but the chilling effect is very real.
[02:04:00.806 --> 02:04:04.228]  This is how political correctness is strangling freedom.
[02:04:04.228 --> 02:04:09.913]  People are going to be terrified of expressing any political belief, even if it's satirical.
[02:04:10.433 --> 02:04:12.874]  Even if it's not even meant to be political!
[02:04:12.874 --> 02:04:19.877]  If we allow them to characterize Nazi jokes or Mohammed cartoons as hate speech, then it's only the beginning.
[02:04:19.877 --> 02:04:28.300]  The end will bring us full circle to the very reason political correctness was created in communist countries in the first place.
[02:04:28.300 --> 02:04:36.543]  To stifle, censor, and punish anyone who dares speak out against the state or the prevailing cultural mantra.
[02:04:45.223 --> 02:04:50.166]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[02:04:50.166 --> 02:04:56.189]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:04:56.189 --> 02:04:58.050]  They've not shut down our speech!
[02:04:58.050 --> 02:05:03.573]  We're at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com and we're defeating the leftist tyrants!
[02:05:03.573 --> 02:05:11.057]  I got mobbed on the streets by fans, but almost all of them said, we used to love you on air, it was so good to see you on the iTunes or on YouTube.
[02:05:11.057 --> 02:05:12.378]  Are you coming back?
[02:05:12.378 --> 02:05:13.519]  We're at InfoWars.com.
[02:05:14.119 --> 02:05:15.480]  We're at NewsHorse.com.
[02:05:15.480 --> 02:05:17.740]  Paul Watson's launched his own Summit.News.
[02:05:17.740 --> 02:05:18.661]  We have our own videos.
[02:05:18.661 --> 02:05:19.741]  We have our own articles.
[02:05:19.741 --> 02:05:24.483]  They're trying to destroy us, but thanks to you and others having us on, InfoWars are still chugging along.
[02:05:24.483 --> 02:05:26.744]  So we're there, folks, tomorrow's news, today.
[02:05:26.744 --> 02:05:28.325]  InfoWars!
[02:05:28.325 --> 02:05:31.646]  Don't tell me!
[02:05:31.646 --> 02:05:31.706]  Woo!
[02:05:33.101 --> 02:05:36.164]  InfoWars.com, because that's a bunch of people out here.
[02:05:36.164 --> 02:05:37.705]  I'm talking about InfoWars.com.
[02:05:37.705 --> 02:05:40.747]  I'm at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[02:05:40.747 --> 02:05:42.649]  We knew this censorship was coming forever.
[02:05:42.649 --> 02:05:46.152]  We have our own video streams, our own audio streams, and it's all free to air.
[02:05:46.152 --> 02:05:48.894]  Anybody can use it, re-upload it, do whatever you want.
[02:05:48.894 --> 02:05:51.096]  People go to InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[02:05:51.096 --> 02:05:51.936]  That's where they find it.
[02:05:51.936 --> 02:05:54.138]  You know, there's things called websites.
[02:05:54.138 --> 02:05:54.558]  Just go there.
[02:06:04.014 --> 02:06:08.357]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:06:08.357 --> 02:06:10.898]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:10.898 --> 02:06:14.361]  Well, his birth name's Mark Meakin.
[02:06:14.361 --> 02:06:18.403]  He's known as Count Dankula.
[02:06:27.528 --> 02:06:35.002]  And his great crime is getting hundreds of millions of views on YouTube and other channels with really funny humor.
[02:06:35.002 --> 02:06:38.730]  And after John Cleese came out last year,
[02:06:40.263 --> 02:06:43.564]  And he made reference to things like Count Dangelo's case.
[02:06:43.564 --> 02:06:45.225]  He said, this is insane.
[02:06:45.225 --> 02:06:50.887]  John Cleese, of course, of Monty Python fame, that regular humor now, you get arrested for it.
[02:06:50.887 --> 02:06:55.049]  I mean, even if Count Dangelo was trying to be a Nazi, he has free speech.
[02:06:55.049 --> 02:06:58.330]  Because if you take Nazis' free speech, you've taken everybody's free speech.
[02:06:58.330 --> 02:07:07.354]  But now what you've seen in Europe, is in the UK, is here in the US, where they say if it hurts somebody's feelings, we're going to de-platform you or we're going to arrest you.
[02:07:08.562 --> 02:07:13.924]  UKIP candidate Mark Meacham linked to racist forum post.
[02:07:13.924 --> 02:07:21.007]  So the new thing they do is they'll talk about, before I was totally banned off Facebook, fan pages.
[02:07:21.007 --> 02:07:28.431]  We'd have an article about something totally separate, the Nazis, but there'd be a couple comments about Jews in the comments, probably SJWs.
[02:07:28.431 --> 02:07:31.512]  And then they would say, Jones is in a major controversy.
[02:07:33.738 --> 02:07:36.300]  Uh, with racist comments.
[02:07:36.300 --> 02:07:40.343]  And so that's how they legitimize we should all go to jail.
[02:07:40.343 --> 02:07:52.452]  Meanwhile, you have Islamists throwing bricks at Tommy Robinson this weekend, attacking families, milkshakes being thrown at everybody, major breweries calling for people to have bricks smashed over their heads.
[02:07:52.452 --> 02:07:58.036]  So, so Count Dankula, still on Twitter, I guess, at Count Dankula TV, YouTube Count Dankula,
[02:07:59.671 --> 02:08:09.098]  Walk through what happened to you briefly for the folks that don't know about Hitler Dog and which again John Cleese and everybody else and Charlie Chaplin did similar things.
[02:08:09.098 --> 02:08:11.520]  Back when we had freedom I guess in our countries.
[02:08:11.520 --> 02:08:20.246]  And then get into the latest of what you're facing as they're still trying to prosecute you and then dovetail that to the atmosphere I'm seeing in Europe and the UK.
[02:08:20.246 --> 02:08:22.888]  It seems to just be incredibly fascistic.
[02:08:23.688 --> 02:08:27.729]  Against people that are born there, conservatives, Christians, comics.
[02:08:27.729 --> 02:08:31.230]  It seems like real authoritarianism is spreading its wings.
[02:08:31.230 --> 02:08:33.391]  So thanks for joining us.
[02:08:33.391 --> 02:08:36.372]  It's very good to be back and completely true.
[02:08:36.372 --> 02:08:41.613]  Authoritarianism is spreading throughout the United Kingdom and also through Europe.
[02:08:41.613 --> 02:08:45.014]  Initially with myself, you know, a lot of people know the story.
[02:08:45.014 --> 02:08:48.515]  My girlfriend kept talking about how cute and adorable her little dog was.
[02:08:48.515 --> 02:08:51.176]  I was sick and fed up of hearing how cute the dog was.
[02:08:51.736 --> 02:09:01.408]  I thought it would be funny to get the dog to raise its paw in a Nazi salute whenever I said Zikaio, and I got the dog to react happily whenever I said the phrase, gas the Jews.
[02:09:01.408 --> 02:09:09.357]  The entire point of the joke was the juxtaposition of this cute and adorable animal doing something horrific and offensive.
[02:09:09.357 --> 02:09:11.179]  That was the basis for the joke.
[02:09:12.240 --> 02:09:16.341]  As a result of that, I was arrested and charged with hate crime.
[02:09:16.341 --> 02:09:22.823]  I was kept in prison until my court date, and then I was released to await my full trial.
[02:09:22.823 --> 02:09:26.584]  The trial ended up lasting around two years.
[02:09:26.584 --> 02:09:29.265]  The Nuremberg trials lasted half as long.
[02:09:29.985 --> 02:09:30.685]  We're good to go.
[02:09:53.012 --> 02:09:54.073]  Well, come and get me.
[02:09:54.073 --> 02:09:55.613]  I'm not bending the knee here.
[02:09:55.613 --> 02:09:57.534]  You know, if you want your money, you can come and get me.
[02:09:57.534 --> 02:09:58.795]  You can come and take me to jail.
[02:09:58.795 --> 02:10:01.296]  I'm prepared to go to prison for what I believe in.
[02:10:01.296 --> 02:10:08.000]  But instead, what the cops did was seized the money from my account without notifying me first.
[02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:12.783]  So I think they knew if they came after me and they arrested me, you know, everything would all kick off again.
[02:10:12.783 --> 02:10:15.504]  Everyone would come after the police, come after the establishment.
[02:10:15.504 --> 02:10:20.807]  So they just sort of decided to take the easy way out and just seize the money from my account.
[02:10:21.877 --> 02:10:22.037]  That's
[02:10:36.476 --> 02:10:40.659]  Brick walls seem to be getting built by those that are quite high up in the court system.
[02:10:40.659 --> 02:10:52.386]  Basically, they really don't want my conviction to be overturned because they really want to hold on the precedent that it sets where the context and intent of your words and actions do not matter.
[02:10:52.386 --> 02:11:03.392]  It's basically the court and the system get to invent the thoughts that were in your head and get to create their own narrative and convict you based on what they assume to be your thoughts.
[02:11:03.392 --> 02:11:06.214]  It's a system that Stalin absolutely would have loved.
[02:11:07.367 --> 02:11:21.473]  It is beyond 1984, and just when I thought it couldn't get any worse, first they banned me off YouTube and off Twitter and off Spotify and 50-something other things.
[02:11:21.473 --> 02:11:22.374]  iTunes, you name it.
[02:11:22.374 --> 02:11:22.594]  Then...
[02:11:24.147 --> 02:11:30.913]  They banned, three weeks ago, shaming my name or my websites in a positive way.
[02:11:30.913 --> 02:11:39.881]  So that's telling 2.4 billion users what they can prohibitively say and what they can't say, and that they can only say something mean about someone.
[02:11:39.881 --> 02:11:45.387]  Imagine reading that in a 1984 novel, you'd think that's preposterous, that'll never happen.
[02:11:45.387 --> 02:11:46.508]  But it's beyond that.
[02:11:47.108 --> 02:11:51.629]  And then you go, hey, John Cleese did it, Charlie Chaplin did it, and they just don't want to hear it.
[02:11:51.629 --> 02:11:57.171]  And then the left in this country celebrates it and says, we need that here.
[02:11:57.171 --> 02:12:04.294]  And now, undercover videos of people bragging about selling dead baby parts that's illegal, those people don't get indicted.
[02:12:04.294 --> 02:12:07.335]  The folks that shoot the undercover video get indicted.
[02:12:07.335 --> 02:12:07.975]  And even the L.A.
[02:12:07.975 --> 02:12:12.196]  Times and journalist groups said, this is like Soviet Russia.
[02:12:12.196 --> 02:12:14.197]  I mean, it's so dangerous.
[02:12:15.137 --> 02:12:19.321]  I mean, can you speak to now banning people's names?
[02:12:19.321 --> 02:12:23.966]  I think it's... See, when you say 1984, there is a system exactly similar to that.
[02:12:23.966 --> 02:12:35.457]  The Emanuel Goldstein, the subject of the Two Minutes Hate, it's a person where the only time you are allowed to reference or speak about them is if you are spewing hatred and bile about them.
[02:12:35.457 --> 02:12:36.298]  You're not allowed to say,
[02:12:36.798 --> 02:12:40.081]  Words of support, affection, or even just basic discussion.
[02:12:40.081 --> 02:12:44.604]  The only thing that's allowed to come out of your mouth is hatred in regards to this person.
[02:12:44.604 --> 02:12:53.031]  It's actively... See when you... See if Facebook and the other social media platforms have brought in rules where you are not allowed to say nice things about this person.
[02:12:53.031 --> 02:12:54.692]  You are only allowed to say bad things.
[02:12:54.692 --> 02:12:57.534]  That is them literally instigating hate.
[02:12:57.534 --> 02:13:00.477]  The very thing that they claim to be trying to prevent.
[02:13:00.477 --> 02:13:03.659]  But it's a case of, you know, no bad tactics, just bad targets.
[02:13:06.181 --> 02:13:16.924]  It's a case of what happened to you was that you were the measure to gauge the public response when the Silicon Valley collaborated together to completely remove you from all of the platforms.
[02:13:16.924 --> 02:13:17.904]  You were the measure.
[02:13:17.904 --> 02:13:33.249]  If there's something morally bankrupt that you want to do, which is a standard you want to set, the only way that you're going to be able to get people on your side for creating this new status quo is to first go after a target that they all hate, that they don't like, and they managed to make that you.
[02:13:33.829 --> 02:13:45.334]  You know, media has managed to make so many people hate you and, you know, vilify you and paint you as this evil Bond villain, you know, that's trying to get people killed and all that type of stuff, which is something I've never heard you advocate for.
[02:13:45.334 --> 02:13:48.955]  But, you know, if you tell a lie enough times, eventually people will believe it.
[02:13:48.955 --> 02:13:55.738]  And once they had enough people hating on you, they went after you with this absolutely morally bankrupt method and people cheered.
[02:13:56.731 --> 02:14:01.294]  People cheered, even though what they did was absolutely horrendously wrong.
[02:14:01.294 --> 02:14:05.897]  Because it was you and they got enough people to hate you, then they cheered instead.
[02:14:26.451 --> 02:14:26.911]  I think so.
[02:14:45.061 --> 02:14:49.666]  And people always say you hit the nail on the head, but you just blew the doors off.
[02:14:49.666 --> 02:14:51.168]  That is exactly what's happening.
[02:14:51.168 --> 02:14:55.953]  And what's crazy is, you're an informed guy, because I've watched some of your online shows over the years.
[02:14:55.953 --> 02:14:57.554]  You talk about history.
[02:14:57.554 --> 02:14:58.996]  This is what the Soviets did.
[02:14:58.996 --> 02:14:59.617]  It's what Mao did.
[02:14:59.617 --> 02:15:00.658]  It's what Hitler did.
[02:15:00.658 --> 02:15:07.485]  They always pick some little unpopular minority first, and then they demonize that group.
[02:15:08.922 --> 02:15:13.544]  Turn them into demons, and then once nobody stands up for them, they come for everybody.
[02:15:13.544 --> 02:15:20.288]  And what's crazy is they have neocons running this at big forums in Berlin and stuff, saying...
[02:15:21.454 --> 02:15:26.279]  Last year, once we get WikiLeaks and Jones, we're going to ban everybody.
[02:15:26.279 --> 02:15:29.802]  And we're going to totally take over the web and end free speech, and it's going to be wonderful.
[02:15:29.802 --> 02:15:36.108]  And I'm reading these blueprints for absolute evil, and I'm just wondering, when does humanity wake up?
[02:15:36.108 --> 02:15:37.229]  When does humanity strike back?
[02:15:37.229 --> 02:15:44.916]  I want to talk about that with one of the most banned individuals in the world, Count Dankula, a hilarious comedian, a smart guy, and on top of that,
[02:15:45.937 --> 02:15:49.944]  I did Hitler dog with my dog that's now a deceased captain, too.
[02:15:49.944 --> 02:15:51.507]  Because he has a Hitler mustache.
[02:15:51.507 --> 02:15:52.528]  It's a joke.
[02:15:52.528 --> 02:15:53.149]  Are they going to arrest me?
[02:15:55.228 --> 02:15:59.252]  Stocks and options trading involves financial risk and is not suitable for all investors.
[02:15:59.252 --> 02:16:02.595]  Hey guys, it's Scott Bauer here, CEO of Prosper Trading Academy.

[02:16:57.635 --> 02:17:00.517]  Learn how to get sober after we share these stories.
[02:17:00.517 --> 02:17:05.581]  I was 35 with two beautiful children when my life and addiction started to spiral out of control.
[02:17:05.581 --> 02:17:12.767]  After my divorce, I went into a depression cycle and started drinking more often and using prescription drugs.
[02:17:12.767 --> 02:17:17.311]  After my second DWI and arrest, my ex-husband threatened to take our children away from me.
[02:17:17.911 --> 02:17:21.534]  I was 17 when I became addicted to heroin and meth.
[02:17:21.534 --> 02:17:24.676]  I thought I could quit on my own, but I couldn't.
[02:17:24.676 --> 02:17:27.297]  It hit me when I was arrested.
[02:17:27.297 --> 02:17:28.798]  Get sober now.
[02:17:28.798 --> 02:17:32.141]  Your private insurance may cover costs and we'll get you here.
[02:17:32.141 --> 02:17:32.921]  It's simple.

[02:17:40.206 --> 02:17:40.246]  800-213-9264
[02:17:58.214 --> 02:18:00.075]  Mike in New Jersey, you're on the air.
[02:18:00.075 --> 02:18:00.935]  Thanks for calling, Mike.
[02:18:00.935 --> 02:18:02.295]  You are the man, Alex.
[02:18:02.295 --> 02:18:03.816]  I'm so glad to be talking to you.
[02:18:03.816 --> 02:18:04.616]  I'm so excited.
[02:18:04.616 --> 02:18:05.516]  I'm such a big fan.
[02:18:05.516 --> 02:18:07.997]  Ever since I've been listening, I've been buying your products.
[02:18:07.997 --> 02:18:10.498]  I gotta do a shout-out for the Bone Broth.
[02:18:10.498 --> 02:18:11.919]  The Bone Broth.
[02:18:11.919 --> 02:18:13.359]  The Bone Broth.
[02:18:13.359 --> 02:18:14.759]  The Bone Broth.
[02:18:14.759 --> 02:18:16.020]  The Bone Broth.
[02:18:16.020 --> 02:18:20.761]  Tastes like, tastes like a great milkshake, you know, if you just add it to milk.
[02:18:20.761 --> 02:18:21.942]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[02:18:21.942 --> 02:18:23.362]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[02:18:23.362 --> 02:18:24.823]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[02:18:24.823 --> 02:18:25.063]  Like,
[02:18:25.583 --> 02:18:26.264]  Good!
[02:18:26.264 --> 02:18:26.844]  Whoa!
[02:18:26.844 --> 02:18:28.566]  I feel great since I've been taking it.
[02:18:28.566 --> 02:18:33.069]  My daughter uses the Bubblegum Fluoride 3 toothpaste.
[02:18:33.069 --> 02:18:36.552]  I've used the Supermail Vitality, a host of other products.
[02:18:36.552 --> 02:18:38.594]  So thank you so much for that as well.
[02:18:38.594 --> 02:18:41.156]  Brother, you're thanking me for buying the products and keeping us on air.
[02:18:41.156 --> 02:18:41.897]  I'm thanking you.
[02:18:41.897 --> 02:18:48.342]  But yes, this is the ultimate bone broth formula with the turmeric, the chaga mushroom, the true bone broth.
[02:18:48.342 --> 02:18:49.083]  It is next level.
[02:18:49.083 --> 02:18:49.723]  It really is good.
[02:18:49.723 --> 02:18:50.284]  So thank you.
[02:18:50.284 --> 02:18:52.225]  I feel great since I've been taking it.

[02:19:59.335 --> 02:20:02.418]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:02.418 --> 02:20:09.683]  Well, I walked back down
[02:20:20.874 --> 02:20:25.120]  No, I won't back down.
[02:20:25.120 --> 02:20:29.446]  You can stand me up at the gates of hell.
[02:20:29.446 --> 02:20:31.249]  Welcome back, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:20:31.249 --> 02:20:34.313]  I'm talking to the fellow pot criminal, Count Dankula.
[02:20:34.313 --> 02:20:35.695]  If you're a TV viewer, you can just see...
[02:20:36.556 --> 02:20:37.536]  We can't find the video.
[02:20:37.536 --> 02:20:42.258]  They found a still of when we did Hitler Dog with my deceased French Bulldog.
[02:20:42.258 --> 02:20:43.939]  He lived to about age 11.
[02:20:43.939 --> 02:20:45.319]  Captain.
[02:20:45.319 --> 02:20:46.840]  And he did look like Hitler.
[02:20:46.840 --> 02:20:48.261]  That's his fault.
[02:20:48.261 --> 02:20:59.885]  So I was saying, if the teapots got banned at JCPenney's because some lunatic saw a Hitler mustache on the teapot, well then, should the dog be banned?
[02:20:59.885 --> 02:21:01.526]  Because it looks like he has a Hitler mustache.
[02:21:02.639 --> 02:21:08.324]  But this mental illness is being encouraged by the cultural left to end free speech.
[02:21:08.324 --> 02:21:14.088]  They admit that they want people to find the microaggressions.
[02:21:14.088 --> 02:21:20.454]  Count Dankula, again, spent time in jail, refused to pay the fine, still in court battles with them.
[02:21:20.454 --> 02:21:27.740]  Now watching the police let the Islamists throw bricks at Tommy Robinson and people having a legal, lawful, political rally.
[02:21:28.982 --> 02:21:39.513]  Watching, I've got articles here with major breweries, stories on Infowars.com in the UK, saying don't use milkshakes, hit people in the face with bricks.
[02:21:39.513 --> 02:21:48.042]  Describe, you're there in the UK, the atmosphere, what's happening, you're running for office as well, you know, a great way to fight the censorship, what you've gone through, what you're seeing.
[02:21:49.608 --> 02:22:17.650]  Well, the thing that I don't understand is the argument that people always make against me is that my spicy jokes and edgy comedy and offensive memes can encourage violence and encourage people to commit, you know, physical acts against the people that I joke about, but then you have these exact same people trying to justify assaulting political candidates, you know, albeit as a milkshake, a very minor form of assault, but how does the escalation argument that they make in regards to my jokes not apply to that?
[02:22:18.150 --> 02:22:21.594]  Because, I mean, in a matter of days it went from milkshakes to bricks.
[02:22:21.594 --> 02:22:22.636]  In days.
[02:22:22.636 --> 02:22:23.437]  In a matter of days.
[02:22:23.437 --> 02:22:26.100]  And then you've got people in the media that are cheering it on.
[02:22:26.100 --> 02:22:35.952]  I think it's only going to be a matter of time before someone, you know, Nigel Farage, Tommy Robinson, you know, me or Sargon, we're not going to get hit with a milkshake, we're going to get hit with a brick.
[02:22:36.452 --> 02:22:37.413]  We're going to get hit with a brick.
[02:22:37.413 --> 02:22:38.774]  We're going to be seriously assaulted.
[02:22:38.774 --> 02:22:40.195]  Someone is going to be injured.
[02:22:40.195 --> 02:22:41.075]  Someone's going to get hurt.
[02:22:41.075 --> 02:22:45.198]  This could result in a death.
[02:22:45.198 --> 02:22:52.483]  One of the main things that gets brought up is the murder of Joe Cox, which was an absolutely tragic, horrendous thing.
[02:22:52.483 --> 02:22:56.805]  And obviously measures should be taken to prevent such a thing from ever happening again.
[02:22:56.805 --> 02:23:02.109]  But these same people who often use Joe Cox's death as a weapon
[02:23:03.129 --> 02:23:08.372]  Are the same people that are encouraging this type of thing and I can't understand the hypocrisy.
[02:23:08.372 --> 02:23:10.833]  You know, it starts with milkshakes and it goes to bricks.
[02:23:10.833 --> 02:23:14.756]  People said that this could escalate in violence and it did in a matter of days.
[02:23:14.756 --> 02:23:21.600]  And I do think it's going to be, it's only a matter of time before someone is seriously injured or killed through this rhetoric.
[02:23:21.600 --> 02:23:25.702]  By the way, Charlton Brewing Company in the UK said no to our customers.
[02:23:25.702 --> 02:23:28.284]  Please don't throw our beer over fascists.
[02:23:29.301 --> 02:23:32.704]  Get them over the head with a brick is traditional.
[02:23:32.704 --> 02:23:34.325]  So that's saying kill somebody.
[02:23:34.325 --> 02:23:39.929]  Then somebody sent him an email and a tweet saying, hey, you're really asking for trouble.
[02:23:39.929 --> 02:23:42.751]  They then freaked out and said, oh my God, we're being threatened.
[02:23:42.751 --> 02:23:50.937]  So the left has no self-realization and they don't see hypocrisy or paradoxes where they're always calling for attacking everyone.
[02:23:50.937 --> 02:23:55.901]  And then even if someone fights back like the Proud Boys, they then call them a terrorist organization.
[02:23:58.143 --> 02:24:03.787]  Yeah, if you defend yourself against these attacks, you're a fascist, racist, Nazi, etc, etc.
[02:24:03.787 --> 02:24:11.572]  Like, I mean, even one thing I said as well, I posted a tweet where I said, if anyone, you know, comes at me with a milkshake, you know, I will boot them up and down the street.
[02:24:12.171 --> 02:24:18.433]  If someone tries to assault me, I will defend myself and I will set an example to make sure that nobody attempts to do it again.
[02:24:18.433 --> 02:24:24.355]  And people were trying to say that, you know, I was the violent one and it's like, no, I'm not the one that's going around looking to assault people.
[02:24:24.355 --> 02:24:26.796]  I've said that I will defend myself.
[02:24:26.796 --> 02:24:28.957]  But people were trying to paint me as the violent one.
[02:24:28.957 --> 02:24:29.177]  Well,
[02:24:29.797 --> 02:24:32.298]  I'm not the one that's going up trying to assault people.
[02:24:32.298 --> 02:24:33.618]  I said I'd defend myself.
[02:24:33.618 --> 02:24:37.599]  You're saying you'll assault people, you're the instigators, but they're always trying.
[02:24:37.599 --> 02:24:47.161]  Even though you've just said, I will defend myself from your horrible actions, they still try and paint you as the bad guy, even though they're the people instigating it.
[02:24:47.161 --> 02:24:49.982]  They have an absolute complete lack of self-awareness.
[02:24:49.982 --> 02:24:53.863]  It's mind-boggling that they can't see themselves for what they really are.
[02:24:53.863 --> 02:24:54.763]  I think they're just really
[02:24:55.323 --> 02:25:00.365]  They just really want an excuse to act out these horrible impulses that they have.
[02:25:00.365 --> 02:25:07.567]  I think there's something deep and evil breeding within them and they just want an excuse to let it out.
[02:25:07.567 --> 02:25:08.947]  That's what it looks like to me.
[02:25:08.947 --> 02:25:21.111]  They want to pick a group of people to dehumanise to the point where they can carry out these horrible impulses on them guilt-free because they've made themselves convinced that they're the good guys and we are the bad guys.
[02:25:22.851 --> 02:25:24.394]  I totally agree with you.
[02:25:24.394 --> 02:25:30.963]  And then the big media and the corporate systems, everything from CNN to The Economist, is encouraging assaults.
[02:25:30.963 --> 02:25:33.627]  CBS TV has a show called The Good Fight.
[02:25:34.585 --> 02:25:39.449]  Where it says anyone supporting Trump is a Nazi.
[02:25:39.449 --> 02:25:42.011]  And so therefore, attack any Trump supporter.
[02:25:42.011 --> 02:25:51.658]  They also said assassinate the president, but I really want to pull up the article where CBS, The Good Fight, and we'll show that to viewers, says punch a Nazi.
[02:25:51.658 --> 02:25:53.760]  Well then everyone is a Nazi.
[02:25:53.760 --> 02:25:57.563]  EU leaders sound alarm over populist election threat.
[02:25:58.143 --> 02:25:59.285]  French News Agency.
[02:25:59.285 --> 02:26:04.614]  And that's, I think, what's really happening is they know people are waking up and this is attempted bullying and intimidation.
[02:26:04.614 --> 02:26:09.502]  This is threats of violence or violence to carry out a political aim.
[02:26:09.502 --> 02:26:12.027]  That is the definition of terrorism, Count Dankula.
[02:26:13.703 --> 02:26:18.247]  The thing that I don't understand is they're trying to turn populism into a dirty word.
[02:26:18.247 --> 02:26:23.091]  Populism is caring about the fears, concerns and issues of ordinary people.
[02:26:23.091 --> 02:26:28.495]  I have no idea in what universe that that can be considered a bad thing.
[02:26:28.495 --> 02:26:30.897]  The reason I feel that Brexit happened is
[02:26:31.934 --> 02:26:34.838]  People were not having their concerns addressed.
[02:26:34.838 --> 02:26:36.780]  People didn't feel like they had a voice.
[02:26:36.780 --> 02:26:46.894]  They were given a chance to take back some of their sovereignty, pride, respect for their nation, something that they feel is theirs, something that belongs to them.
[02:26:48.533 --> 02:26:56.080]  They were painted as racists, bigots, radicals, extremists and absolutely smeared by the media.
[02:26:56.080 --> 02:27:04.068]  See when it comes to things like Brexit and populist movements, the way that the establishment is conducting itself, they're asking for it.
[02:27:04.068 --> 02:27:06.691]  You can't just turn around to millions of people and say,
[02:27:07.271 --> 02:27:08.893]  Your problems don't matter.
[02:27:08.893 --> 02:27:09.393]  Shut up.
[02:27:09.393 --> 02:27:09.954]  You're wrong.
[02:27:09.954 --> 02:27:10.694]  You're racist.
[02:27:10.694 --> 02:27:11.695]  You're a Nazi.
[02:27:11.695 --> 02:27:20.442]  And then also put out this rhetoric that it's okay to assault and hurt these people because they've been dehumanized to that point where you can do it guilt-free.
[02:27:21.858 --> 02:27:39.183]  And then meanwhile, they're bringing in race-based groups and siccing them on indigenous populations, and meanwhile, they're funding radical real Nazi party to take over Ukraine, NATO is, publicly, and George Soros is an admitted Nazi collaborator in his own words.
[02:27:39.183 --> 02:27:44.424]  So they're really the ones with the Nazi past, and the EU was a brainchild of Adolf Hitler.
[02:27:46.345 --> 02:27:52.850]  This is the thing, it's like the parallels that run between the European Union and the Third Reich.
[02:27:52.850 --> 02:27:59.214]  A lot of people roll their eyes whenever you make this argument, but it's the case of a united Europe with its own army.
[02:28:00.018 --> 02:28:10.403]  And you even have Guy Verhofstadt, you know, making, you know, whenever he speaks, he's very animated with his hands, like another famous person from history who wanted a united Europe.
[02:28:10.403 --> 02:28:21.088]  And whenever you see these parallels, and especially, you know, the swings towards authoritarianism, especially with Article 13, which is following, it's the baby steps of the Chinese model of a censored internet.
[02:28:21.568 --> 02:28:22.189]  That's what they want.
[02:28:22.189 --> 02:28:33.436]  They're basically saying, no, no, this is to be done to protect... They try to make the argument of it's to protect the little guy, it's to protect the independent journalists, it's to protect this, it's to protect that, you know, it's the little guy, it's to make sure they get paid.
[02:28:33.436 --> 02:28:38.460]  No, the people that benefit most from this is the music companies who lobbied it in.
[02:28:39.060 --> 02:28:40.182]  That's right, exactly.
[02:28:40.182 --> 02:28:43.748]  It's old media getting together with government to shut down their competition.
[02:28:43.748 --> 02:28:50.398]  I'm going to ask Count Dangula how we strike back, how we fight back, where he thinks these critical elections are going, and so much more.
[02:28:50.398 --> 02:28:53.603]  And a little surprise, a Bernie Sanders surprise.
[02:28:55.160 --> 02:28:59.722]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[02:28:59.722 --> 02:29:01.803]  You don't know me and we'll never meet.
[02:29:01.803 --> 02:29:03.544]  I had a problem like you once.
[02:29:03.544 --> 02:29:10.107]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life.
[02:29:10.107 --> 02:29:15.169]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[02:29:15.169 --> 02:29:19.871]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone,
[02:29:20.311 --> 02:29:23.433]  You need to call the National Treatment Advisors.

[02:31:16.248 --> 02:31:20.371]  Well, thousands of years ago, it's what everybody told people they should drink in a soup if they were sick.
[02:31:21.232 --> 02:31:26.840]  But then you add not just the fact that this is the strongest, most concentrated, highest quality bone broth out there.
[02:31:26.840 --> 02:31:27.961]  Literally.
[02:31:27.961 --> 02:31:38.656]  Then you have the chaga mushroom, then you have the turmeric, then you have the bee pollen, then you have the other key ingredients that are all known to just make people incredibly strong and healthy.
[02:31:39.176 --> 02:31:41.397]  Our ultimate bone broth formula is amazing.
[02:31:41.397 --> 02:31:46.280]  It's 50% off right now in fullmorestore.com because I want you to try it and see how great it is.
[02:31:46.280 --> 02:31:49.141]  And of course, getting the bone broth isn't just great for you and your family.
[02:31:49.141 --> 02:31:55.285]  It's also amazing when it comes to funding our operation that's taking on the globalists and fighting for all of our freedoms.
[02:31:55.825 --> 02:31:59.989]  The globalists are hyper-competitive scientific dictators.
[02:31:59.989 --> 02:32:01.050]  They are technocrats.
[02:32:01.050 --> 02:32:03.352]  They are control freaks in their own words.
[02:32:03.352 --> 02:32:10.759]  And they believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own decisions gets in the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[02:32:10.759 --> 02:32:12.581]  And we're fighting them hard in cyberspace.
[02:32:12.581 --> 02:32:14.683]  We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension.
[02:32:15.183 --> 02:32:21.528]  One of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[02:32:21.528 --> 02:32:26.731]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from 4warslife.com, I couldn't do it.
[02:32:26.731 --> 02:32:35.737]  That's why we decided to take our original Secret 12 that was incredibly high quality medical bottlement and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.
[02:32:36.718 --> 02:32:42.682]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12 over the counter that you're going to find anywhere.
[02:32:42.682 --> 02:32:43.643]  It is amazing.
[02:32:43.643 --> 02:32:53.689]  Experience pure Methylcobalamin B12 for yourself and fund the Second American Revolution against the tyrants at InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLive.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:32:53.689 --> 02:32:55.030]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:10.009 --> 02:33:11.850]  From the front lines!
[02:33:11.850 --> 02:33:14.872]  It's no brag, that's fact.
[02:33:14.872 --> 02:33:20.836]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:20.836 --> 02:33:22.597]  Mother!
[02:33:22.597 --> 02:33:24.938]  Mother!
[02:33:24.938 --> 02:33:28.640]  Tell your children not to walk my way.
[02:33:28.640 --> 02:33:31.342]  Tell your children not to hear my words.
[02:33:31.342 --> 02:33:33.703]  What they mean, what they say.
[02:33:33.703 --> 02:33:35.444]  Mother!
[02:33:35.444 --> 02:33:36.185]  Mother!
[02:33:38.382 --> 02:33:40.823]  Can you keep him in the dark for life?
[02:33:40.823 --> 02:33:44.505]  Can you hide him from the waiting world?
[02:33:44.505 --> 02:33:47.086]  No, you can't, Tim Cook.
[02:33:47.086 --> 02:33:48.807]  You can't.
[02:33:48.807 --> 02:33:50.007]  Obama.
[02:33:50.007 --> 02:33:52.568]  Father!
[02:33:52.568 --> 02:33:56.210]  I'm gonna take your daughter out tonight.
[02:33:56.210 --> 02:33:59.211]  I'm gonna show her my world.
[02:33:59.211 --> 02:34:00.951]  You're not gonna stop the signal.
[02:34:00.951 --> 02:34:01.852]  You're gonna fail.
[02:34:03.010 --> 02:34:05.391]  That's why you're a bunch of globalist followers.
[02:34:05.391 --> 02:34:08.771]  Not about to bend our knees to you.
[02:34:08.771 --> 02:34:13.353]  But if you want to bang heads, you're gonna get to.
[02:34:13.353 --> 02:34:22.855]  Going back to Count Dankula, you know, the tip of the spear of the enemy is saying a comedian, a successful comedian, can't have his pug, Heil Hitler.
[02:34:26.593 --> 02:34:28.754]  Saying John Cleese can't do that.
[02:34:28.754 --> 02:34:31.835]  And people can spin that all day and say, oh, don't whine about it.
[02:34:31.835 --> 02:34:34.896]  We're just going to let you be arrested in England.
[02:34:34.896 --> 02:34:36.877]  Arrested in England.
[02:34:36.877 --> 02:34:39.878]  Arrested in the birthplace of supposedly free speech.
[02:34:39.878 --> 02:34:41.099]  My God, what's next?
[02:34:41.099 --> 02:34:42.379]  Well, we know what's next.
[02:34:42.379 --> 02:34:48.522]  We'll arrest you if you don't use the right word for he or she or if you misgender somebody.
[02:34:48.522 --> 02:34:51.863]  They're always moving the goalposts, Count Dankula.
[02:34:51.863 --> 02:34:53.904]  Where do you think they'll move the goalposts next?
[02:34:55.629 --> 02:35:01.074]  I think it's going to be, right now it's starting with anything in relation to diversity.
[02:35:01.074 --> 02:35:06.199]  I believe that diversity is being used as an excuse to bring these things in.
[02:35:06.934 --> 02:35:24.144]  Because, for example, you know, if you make any racist comments, comments about transgender people, comments about LGBT, so on and so on, if you try and defend your speech or defend someone's rights to do that, then it's very, very easy for them to paint you as a racist Nazi bigot, etc, etc.
[02:35:24.144 --> 02:35:30.428]  And these are terms where anyone branded them has already been dehumanised to the point where people can do whatever they want to these people.
[02:35:30.428 --> 02:35:32.509]  These people technically aren't human.
[02:35:32.509 --> 02:35:34.270]  You can do whatever you want to them, guilt-free.
[02:35:34.890 --> 02:35:37.552]  So, nobody wants to be associated with those terms.
[02:35:37.552 --> 02:35:41.154]  You know, people are trying their hardest to stay the hell away from those terms.
[02:35:41.154 --> 02:35:48.018]  And so, that is why people don't come out and speak out against, you know, free speech being restricted in regards to diversity.
[02:35:48.018 --> 02:35:56.263]  Because if you say, well, no, even though these things are mean, they are horrible, people should still be allowed to say them, you're painted as being against diversity.
[02:35:58.504 --> 02:35:59.345]  That's how they do it.
[02:35:59.345 --> 02:36:07.890]  Because every major comedian I see, when Norm Macdonald or something says the word retarded, which is a scientific word, they go, oh, he didn't mean to hurt, he's sorry, he won't say it anymore.
[02:36:07.890 --> 02:36:17.677]  No, retarded's a scientific word, like homosexual or heterosexual, and we have to get back in the West to saying, even if you disagree with the speech, people have a right to do it.
[02:36:17.677 --> 02:36:26.183]  But they're tricking everyone to change laws to do this, they're suing me trying to create case law to do this, and it is total authoritarianism.
[02:36:26.183 --> 02:36:27.264]  I want to bring something else up to you.
[02:36:28.324 --> 02:36:42.458]  The right wing, you don't do this, but the right wing tends to jump on bandwagons and go, oh, the left says, if a white person is photographed eating fried chicken near black people, it's code word of making fun of black people.
[02:36:42.458 --> 02:36:44.120]  That's totally mentally ill.
[02:36:44.120 --> 02:36:47.083]  All over the South, people eat fried chicken.
[02:36:47.083 --> 02:36:48.424]  Doesn't matter what color you are.
[02:36:48.424 --> 02:36:50.546]  It's some weird northern projection.
[02:36:50.546 --> 02:36:51.728]  But two years ago, Bill Clinton,
[02:36:52.847 --> 02:36:58.374]  Was at a event and was serving the food that was there in the South.
[02:36:58.374 --> 02:36:59.395]  It had to be chicken.
[02:36:59.395 --> 02:37:00.717]  Black people were eating it.
[02:37:00.717 --> 02:37:03.821]  And the media said it was racist and it was wrong.
[02:37:04.813 --> 02:37:10.097]  And the right wing jumped on it, because this is what people eat probably half the time in many areas of where I live.
[02:37:10.097 --> 02:37:12.199]  I eat fried chicken probably once or twice a week.
[02:37:12.199 --> 02:37:28.633]  The point is, it's insane, like saying a teapot has the image of Hitler in it, and now the right wing has jumped on it and said, oh look, Sanders has really screwed up at a restaurant, at a food event, saying this is great fried chicken and holding it up, even though he'd hold up
[02:37:29.685 --> 02:37:31.706]  Any other food that was finger food.
[02:37:31.706 --> 02:37:34.388]  So this is an attempt to create mass psychosis.
[02:37:34.388 --> 02:37:39.732]  So I got, and they're not a sponsor, Popeye's fried chicken right here.
[02:37:39.732 --> 02:37:45.896]  And I'm going to tell you, I'm going to hold this sucker up right here and I'm going to say, this is really, really good.
[02:37:45.896 --> 02:37:52.240]  And again, the idea that everything is racist, everything is bad.
[02:37:52.240 --> 02:37:55.102]  They're, they're doing this on purpose in my view, Count Dankula.
[02:37:55.102 --> 02:37:56.123]  How bad do you think it's going to get?
[02:37:57.296 --> 02:37:58.417]  I think it is going to get worse.
[02:37:58.417 --> 02:38:02.141]  I think they're trying to encourage it on both sides.
[02:38:02.141 --> 02:38:07.006]  So basically the vast majority of cancel culture right now comes from the far left.
[02:38:07.006 --> 02:38:09.769]  I'm trying not to use the term the left because it isn't all of them.
[02:38:09.769 --> 02:38:14.314]  A lot of people on the left get censored themselves because they're not left enough.
[02:38:14.941 --> 02:38:18.103]  You know, they get kicked out of universities, they get their talks shut down and so on.
[02:38:18.103 --> 02:38:36.873]  Now the vast majority of cancel culture censorship comes from the far left and I'm trying to get people that are on the right to not fall into the trap of, oh well we're just going to use their own tactics against them, we're going to appeal to the higher powers and the establishment and the raging mob to cancel and censor these people and I'm trying to
[02:38:37.573 --> 02:38:39.996]  Pull the leash back on that and go, no, do not do that.
[02:38:39.996 --> 02:38:41.738]  You're simply feeding into the narrative.
[02:38:41.738 --> 02:38:46.002]  If both sides normalise censoring each other, then everyone gets censored.
[02:38:46.002 --> 02:38:47.423]  Nobody wins at the end of the day.
[02:38:47.423 --> 02:38:49.205]  It's just mutually assured destruction.
[02:38:49.205 --> 02:38:59.816]  So, you know, for example, if Bernie Sanders walked up to a synagogue and did a Nazi salute in a Jewish man's face, then yes, I would understand if that caused a little bit of outrage.
[02:39:00.878 --> 02:39:07.339]  Trying to say that basically serving fried chicken at an event that black people were attending, that's a reach.
[02:39:07.339 --> 02:39:09.340]  Everybody likes fried chicken.
[02:39:09.340 --> 02:39:09.820]  Right?
[02:39:09.820 --> 02:39:11.380]  There's nothing racist about it.
[02:39:11.380 --> 02:39:14.821]  Everybody likes fried chicken.
[02:39:14.821 --> 02:39:21.282]  Please continue.
[02:39:21.282 --> 02:39:23.523]  I just don't like the reaches.
[02:39:23.523 --> 02:39:24.703]  Don't you want some now?
[02:39:26.228 --> 02:39:27.109]  I kind of do, yeah.
[02:39:27.109 --> 02:39:28.729]  You are making me a little bit hungry.
[02:39:28.729 --> 02:39:29.990]  Yeah, I'm not going to lie.
[02:39:29.990 --> 02:39:32.371]  I'm trying to focus on what I'm saying.
[02:39:32.371 --> 02:39:42.115]  But, I think, see, trying to find racism and outrage and, you know, offence where there just simply isn't any is going to end up being the death of us.
[02:39:42.115 --> 02:39:46.837]  You know, because it lowers the bar for what should be cancelled as well.
[02:39:46.837 --> 02:39:52.499]  Like, see, for example, even with you, after you, you were seen as probably the most extreme
[02:39:53.283 --> 02:39:55.444]  You were probably viewed as the most extreme.
[02:39:55.444 --> 02:39:56.825]  And they go, OK, well, we need it.
[02:39:56.825 --> 02:40:01.789]  We have a, you know, moral duty as social media platforms to get rid of the extremes.
[02:40:01.789 --> 02:40:02.809]  And then they got rid of you.
[02:40:02.809 --> 02:40:04.851]  So then basically the bar got lowered.
[02:40:04.851 --> 02:40:06.011]  Well, who's the next extreme?
[02:40:06.011 --> 02:40:10.895]  Oh, it's probably the guys posting offensive memes and all this type of stuff, which is us.
[02:40:10.895 --> 02:40:11.975]  So we'll be next to go.
[02:40:11.975 --> 02:40:14.157]  We'll be the ones that are for the chopping block next.
[02:40:14.577 --> 02:40:16.799]  Then we go, and then what happens after that?
[02:40:16.799 --> 02:40:17.880]  Who are the next extremes?
[02:40:17.880 --> 02:40:24.726]  Oh, it's these people that are constantly railing against the government and capitalism and the establishment, which is a lot of people on the left.
[02:40:24.726 --> 02:40:25.927]  And they'll go, well, hold on.
[02:40:25.927 --> 02:40:27.469]  Why are we getting kicked off?
[02:40:27.469 --> 02:40:28.490]  Too late.
[02:40:28.490 --> 02:40:28.990]  Too late.
[02:40:28.990 --> 02:40:29.971]  You applauded it.
[02:40:29.971 --> 02:40:31.172]  You clapped for it.
[02:40:31.172 --> 02:40:32.614]  This is what you wanted.
[02:40:32.614 --> 02:40:35.116]  So you don't exactly get to complain when it gets used on you.
[02:40:36.185 --> 02:40:37.265]  This is the thing as well.
[02:40:37.265 --> 02:40:48.208]  I don't understand people wanting to hand power over to corporations and governments with the naive belief that these corporations and governments are always going to be on their side.
[02:40:48.208 --> 02:40:55.390]  The way the establishment, the governments have worked now, they are not interested in building a better world for everyone.
[02:40:55.390 --> 02:40:59.231]  They are interested in making a better world solely for themselves.
[02:40:59.791 --> 02:41:02.732]  That's the only thing that they're interested in.
[02:41:02.732 --> 02:41:20.838]  The left back in the day, they used to hate the government, they used to hate the corporations, and I still feel strongly that way, even though I was very left-wing back in my day, but I still always had that belief that I don't trust governments and I don't trust corporations, but this new left have completely abandoned that.
[02:41:21.641 --> 02:41:23.022]  They've completely abandoned it.
[02:41:23.022 --> 02:41:24.483]  They worship Mueller.
[02:41:24.483 --> 02:41:26.444]  They worship secret police.
[02:41:26.444 --> 02:41:27.885]  They worship authoritarianism.
[02:41:27.885 --> 02:41:30.666]  Now in polls, Democrats here in the U.S.
[02:41:30.666 --> 02:41:34.308]  are more pro-war than Republicans.
[02:41:34.308 --> 02:41:35.029]  Yeah.
[02:41:35.029 --> 02:41:36.109]  Yeah, they absolutely are.
[02:41:37.503 --> 02:41:42.046]  Why are people on the left advocating for war?
[02:41:42.046 --> 02:41:51.211]  You remember the movement back in the 60s and 70s, everyone railing against Vietnam, you saw them leading peaceful protests, you know, make love not war.
[02:41:51.211 --> 02:41:52.032]  What happened to that?
[02:41:52.819 --> 02:41:56.421]  It was because they were fighting communists then, and I'm not defending those wars.
[02:41:56.421 --> 02:42:02.826]  Now, the globalist corporate communism is here, and now they're the establishment, and now they're going to crack down.
[02:42:02.826 --> 02:42:05.067]  I just don't see it succeeding.
[02:42:05.067 --> 02:42:13.793]  We come back in the final segment, I want to ask you about where you see Europe going, the campaign you've been involved in, Sarkhod, Tommy.
[02:42:13.793 --> 02:42:17.235]  Whether you win or lose, regardless, you're injecting ideas.
[02:42:17.235 --> 02:42:21.218]  What you've witnessed out on the campaign trail, I know you've all been attacked, and
[02:42:22.469 --> 02:42:27.337]  What do you think peak SJW-ism is going to be?
[02:42:27.337 --> 02:42:32.244]  Our guest is Count Dankula, arrested for a Hitler dog meme.
[02:42:33.524 --> 02:42:36.508]  And again, arrested for a meme.
[02:42:36.508 --> 02:42:39.751]  And remember, Europe, I always said, was five years ahead of us.
[02:42:39.751 --> 02:42:40.833]  The UK as well.
[02:42:40.833 --> 02:42:42.094]  That was five years ago.
[02:42:42.094 --> 02:42:43.095]  We're here.
[02:42:43.095 --> 02:42:45.959]  Now they're getting rid of all of our rights and liberties as well.
[02:42:45.959 --> 02:42:47.420]  This is how it happens.
[02:42:47.420 --> 02:42:53.708]  Big corporations with government, Hollywood and others, bullying the American people with empty-foot ground troops.
[02:42:55.307 --> 02:42:58.329]  Everybody knows that supplements are amazing.
[02:42:58.329 --> 02:43:00.931]  That what God gave us through mother nature is incredible.
[02:43:00.931 --> 02:43:03.693]  That's why supplements are the biggest growing industry in the world.
[02:43:03.693 --> 02:43:05.694]  And the globalists are so upset.
[02:43:05.694 --> 02:43:08.516]  The problem is people forget to take them.
[02:43:09.878 --> 02:43:10.179]  That's right.

[02:43:56.112 --> 02:44:03.523]  What you have witnessed is the biggest development in free speech in the Western world's history.
[02:44:03.523 --> 02:44:11.515]  This is a digital, AI-enforced gag order not to say the name Alex Jones or InfoWars.com.
[02:44:17.165 --> 02:44:18.886]  This is Nazi Germany level.
[02:44:18.886 --> 02:44:20.087]  This is racketeering.
[02:44:20.087 --> 02:44:21.208]  This is cartels.
[02:44:21.208 --> 02:44:23.630]  Mr. President, we need your help.
[02:44:23.630 --> 02:44:25.492]  We need it now.
[02:44:25.492 --> 02:44:27.193]  You can take on Big Tech.
[02:44:27.193 --> 02:44:36.141]  They saw Infowars as a dominant, independent, anti-war, pro-human, pro-sovereign, pro-family, populist organization.
[02:44:36.141 --> 02:44:44.168]  So they thought, first they come for Alex Jones, then when people say, okay, take him off the air, everyone else like dominoes would fall.
[02:44:44.168 --> 02:44:45.049]  The way to fight back
[02:44:45.689 --> 02:44:50.514]  It's to support Infowars now more than ever and make it a standard of freedom and free speech.
[02:44:50.514 --> 02:44:54.279]  Understand that if they believe they can take us down, they'll take everybody else down.
[02:44:56.328 --> 02:44:57.989]  Defeat the globalists.

[02:45:20.965 --> 02:45:23.766]  I am patient zero in the massive banning.
[02:45:23.766 --> 02:45:31.029]  But you can override the censors now, and if all of our audience gets involved with hashtag Alex Jones, we are unstoppable together.
[02:45:31.029 --> 02:45:34.991]  We've already changed the world together with our laser focus.

[02:47:44.227 --> 02:47:45.289]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:47:45.289 --> 02:47:46.871]  Count Dankula is our guest.
[02:47:46.871 --> 02:47:50.396]  Paul Joseph Watson, always powerful.
[02:47:50.396 --> 02:47:58.427]  We'll be hosting the fourth hour ahead of the War Room, and I'm told by our camera crew that just walked in, with Caitlin Bennett and with others.
[02:48:00.026 --> 02:48:00.246]  We're good.
[02:48:18.840 --> 02:48:24.202]  And then the left just makes up a fake narrative about them so they can try to make them sad and go away.
[02:48:24.202 --> 02:48:27.024]  Well, we're not sad and we're not going away.
[02:48:27.024 --> 02:48:31.206]  We've got a bunch of new big specials that are running that just started today.
[02:48:32.406 --> 02:48:36.527]  We have the InfoWarsTore.com Memorial Day Mega Sale.
[02:48:36.527 --> 02:48:40.969]  60% off the next level of probiotic, MycoZx.

[02:48:47.231 --> 02:48:49.352]  And believe me, this is a game changer.
[02:48:49.352 --> 02:48:51.793]  Folks are blown away by it, literally.
[02:48:51.793 --> 02:48:56.635]  So MycoZx Plus and XtendoWise is for the heart and cardiovascular.
[02:48:56.635 --> 02:48:57.595]  60% off.
[02:48:57.595 --> 02:49:00.356]  We also have 50% off the 8-pack Power Stack.
[02:49:01.206 --> 02:49:02.347]  We'll tell you about it in a moment.
[02:49:02.347 --> 02:49:05.831]  And we have BODY's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, 95% Cucuminoid.
[02:49:05.831 --> 02:49:07.593]  Nobody else we know of has that.
[02:49:07.593 --> 02:49:09.395]  It's a great deal at regular price, 50% off.
[02:49:09.395 --> 02:49:10.255]  It's amazing.
[02:49:10.255 --> 02:49:12.157]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion is excellent.
[02:49:12.157 --> 02:49:13.939]  Ultimate Bone Broth, you gotta try it.
[02:49:13.939 --> 02:49:17.423]  Supermill Vitality, Salmon, Libido, Energy, all 50% off.

[02:49:38.747 --> 02:49:42.609]  Silver Wound Gel, 40% off, and so much more.
[02:49:42.609 --> 02:49:44.490]  Now, the 8-Pack Power Stack,
[02:49:46.121 --> 02:49:48.042]  We look at the industry, we say, what is best-selling?
[02:49:48.042 --> 02:49:55.166]  A couple years ago, they go, well, people like an AM, PM, take all your stuff in the morning, and then take all your stuff in the evening.
[02:49:55.166 --> 02:49:56.107]  13 pills.
[02:49:56.107 --> 02:49:58.788]  Document cam shot, please, for TV viewers.
[02:49:58.788 --> 02:50:02.130]  And it's got everything in it.
[02:50:02.130 --> 02:50:10.235]  And I'm not gonna belabor it, because we have a guest here, and I wanna get back into the fight of what's happening, but this way you don't forget it, this way you can carry it with you.
[02:50:10.235 --> 02:50:14.197]  A lot of places literally might have a dollar of product in here.
[02:50:15.620 --> 02:50:28.048]  This, to our knowledge, is the most expensive, for what we put in it, not for the cost, most expensive daily care multi-pack system for the quality that's in here.
[02:50:28.048 --> 02:50:30.930]  Most places mark things up seven times.
[02:50:30.930 --> 02:50:31.671]  We had it marked up 150%.
[02:50:31.671 --> 02:50:34.073]  Then we discount it.
[02:50:34.073 --> 02:50:35.814]  We barely make anything, but I want you to try it.
[02:50:36.516 --> 02:50:41.698]  There is a lot of money that goes in to each one of these boxes.
[02:50:41.698 --> 02:50:48.320]  And they're all in there, where you just boom, got your AM, got your PM, it's all right there.
[02:50:48.320 --> 02:50:50.560]  That's our newest product, I'm very excited about it.
[02:50:50.560 --> 02:50:54.882]  And if you're like me, you keep forgetting to take the things you're supposed to take, it's incredible.
[02:50:54.882 --> 02:51:05.825]  I'm not gonna go over everything that's in it, but Flex and Joint Support, Energy Kickstart Formula, Krill Oil Formula, Nootropic Brain Formula, Green Detox Formula in the AM,
[02:51:06.505 --> 02:51:07.767]  When you eat in the morning.
[02:51:07.767 --> 02:51:08.428]  The PM.
[02:51:08.428 --> 02:51:09.369]  Rest and recovery.
[02:51:09.369 --> 02:51:10.812]  Immune support formula.
[02:51:10.812 --> 02:51:11.893]  Shower sleep formula.
[02:51:11.893 --> 02:51:12.554]  Krill oils.
[02:51:12.554 --> 02:51:13.716]  That's a good day and night.
[02:51:13.716 --> 02:51:15.098]  Bone support formula.
[02:51:15.098 --> 02:51:15.418]  Boom!
[02:51:16.803 --> 02:51:18.324]  We're excited, it's amazing.
[02:51:18.324 --> 02:51:20.146]  Count Dankula is our guest.
[02:51:20.146 --> 02:51:25.490]  I was just telling Dankula during the break, he's got to get his own website.
[02:51:25.490 --> 02:51:26.791]  He's gotta send everybody to that.
[02:51:26.791 --> 02:51:33.215]  We've gotta move away from these internet gulags that Drudge talked about here in studio almost four years ago, three and a half years ago.
[02:51:33.215 --> 02:51:41.081]  We've got to get people to email us so we can stay in contact with them with articles and videos, because it's getting to that point where they're even targeting URLs now.
[02:51:41.081 --> 02:51:43.863]  We've got to not give up, because as it gets worse,
[02:51:44.870 --> 02:51:48.733]  It's going to get hotter and hotter if people had our original contact.
[02:51:48.733 --> 02:51:50.474]  But we've got to get people's emails.
[02:51:50.474 --> 02:51:57.760]  You've got to go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and give us your email so we can get you things in the future.
[02:51:57.760 --> 02:52:00.782]  I mean, it's just it's it's it's been incredible.
[02:52:00.782 --> 02:52:07.327]  Getting back to Count Dankula, in closing, I really appreciate your courage, the work you're doing, everything that's happening with these big
[02:52:08.473 --> 02:52:10.215]  EU parliamentary deals.
[02:52:10.215 --> 02:52:13.239]  They are admitting that populists are going to sweep everything.
[02:52:13.239 --> 02:52:15.983]  What do you expect the terroristic left to do next then?
[02:52:18.470 --> 02:52:24.835]  I feel that they're going to play, basically, fast forward the violence that is resulting from this.
[02:52:24.835 --> 02:52:25.496]  That's what I feel.
[02:52:25.496 --> 02:52:37.886]  I feel that there is going to be an escalation that results in violence because there are certain ideas which, now that they've been put to the public, they've been put up for debate, there's enough people discussing these ideas, we've clarified what ones work and what ones don't.
[02:52:37.886 --> 02:52:43.070]  Unfortunately, you know, there are a lot of ideas on the left that do work, a lot of ideas on the right that do work.
[02:52:43.690 --> 02:52:54.239]  The thing that we've seen, and it's coming from both sides, but there is a, it seems to be the left side is establishment endorsed, that they will not admit that their ideas are bad.
[02:52:54.239 --> 02:52:58.082]  They will not then, because they won't try and debate the ideas because they know they can't win.
[02:52:58.082 --> 02:53:02.545]  What they will then do is try and put these ideas in place by force.
[02:53:02.545 --> 02:53:05.568]  And any idea that needs force to win is a bad idea.
[02:53:06.048 --> 02:53:08.209]  Ideas should be able to stand on their own merits.
[02:53:08.209 --> 02:53:14.492]  They can't accept that so they're going to basically use violence to force these ideas down your throat and that is authoritarianism.
[02:53:14.492 --> 02:53:19.735]  I feel that the government wants to grow to a level where it is able to control every single facet of your life.
[02:53:19.735 --> 02:53:22.476]  I mean you're even seeing it especially with the EU.
[02:53:22.476 --> 02:53:27.758]  Pick anything, any minute detail and the EU want to regulate it.
[02:53:27.758 --> 02:53:28.719]  They actually passed a
[02:53:29.439 --> 02:53:38.023]  Law in Poland, I found this out when I was actually there, over the length that candle makers are allowed to make their wicks.
[02:53:38.023 --> 02:53:39.983]  Why does that need regulation?
[02:53:39.983 --> 02:53:41.324]  Why does that need regulation?
[02:53:41.324 --> 02:53:48.427]  There are so many areas of your life that the government seem to want to poke their nose in on that they just have absolutely no business being in.
[02:53:48.427 --> 02:53:56.850]  Which is why we, you know, the movement that I'm from, we want a codified Bill of Rights, you know, modelled on the
[02:53:57.762 --> 02:53:58.583]  I don't think so.
[02:54:16.154 --> 02:54:19.735]  You know, it turns out that our vote isn't as strong as we thought it was.
[02:54:19.735 --> 02:54:25.577]  If we vote against the favour of the establishment, then they will do everything they can to reverse the vote.
[02:54:25.577 --> 02:54:29.198]  The only thing we have is the vote, and even that is losing its power.
[02:54:29.198 --> 02:54:30.579]  And Count Dagula, you just said it.
[02:54:31.079 --> 02:54:32.080]  They're taking your speech.
[02:54:32.080 --> 02:54:34.682]  They jailed you for a Hitler dog meme.
[02:54:34.682 --> 02:54:44.111]  They are letting Islamic groups they brought in attack peaceful nationalist events and women and children and the media just makes jokes about it.
[02:54:44.111 --> 02:54:53.799]  These are real authoritarians who have a real plan and I look at the eyes of the police officers they've hired where they enjoy violating people's rights.
[02:54:53.799 --> 02:54:54.520]  They enjoy
[02:54:56.081 --> 02:54:56.922]  Suppressing the public.
[02:54:56.922 --> 02:54:58.723]  They enjoy selling the country out.
[02:54:58.723 --> 02:55:02.786]  I'm not saying all of them, but the political type enforcers they send out.
[02:55:02.786 --> 02:55:06.069]  And everybody should see this as the clear and present danger.
[02:55:06.069 --> 02:55:08.751]  And the formula is used in Europe.
[02:55:08.751 --> 02:55:10.432]  The formula is used in Australia.
[02:55:10.432 --> 02:55:13.934]  The formula is used in New Zealand and Canada and the UK.
[02:55:15.345 --> 02:55:17.767]  Are the exact formulas being used here?
[02:55:17.767 --> 02:55:24.310]  And it's, like you said, multinational corporations, big media and governments want people to sit down and shut up.
[02:55:24.310 --> 02:55:26.432]  They have a corporate plan for the government.
[02:55:26.432 --> 02:55:28.613]  They have a plan to sell us out of the shycoms.
[02:55:28.613 --> 02:55:29.654]  Big techs moved to China.
[02:55:29.654 --> 02:55:32.135]  They're helping round up millions of their citizens.
[02:55:32.135 --> 02:55:37.979]  Apple and Google are admittedly helped round up two million Uyghurs in Mongolia.
[02:55:37.979 --> 02:55:39.900]  I mean, this is happening.
[02:55:39.900 --> 02:55:41.301]  So, of course, they'll do this here.
[02:55:41.761 --> 02:55:43.862]  And then Tim Cook virtue signals all day.
[02:55:43.862 --> 02:55:46.584]  You know, at universities, what a big liberal he is.
[02:55:46.584 --> 02:55:50.266]  These are very dangerous people that have no bottom.
[02:55:50.266 --> 02:55:53.689]  And that's why, beyond legislation, I agree with you, we need legislation.
[02:55:53.689 --> 02:55:55.230]  We need an Internet Bill of Rights.
[02:55:55.230 --> 02:56:00.893]  Beyond that, we just have to exercise our free speech and do what we want and get back in these people's faces.
[02:56:00.893 --> 02:56:04.776]  And because they'll come up to me in a restaurant and start screaming at me, I get right back up and start screaming at them.
[02:56:04.776 --> 02:56:05.976]  I go to their table and scream at them.
[02:56:05.976 --> 02:56:07.337]  And then they don't like it anymore.
[02:56:07.337 --> 02:56:08.178]  It's not funny anymore.
[02:56:08.658 --> 02:56:10.239]  No, it's definitely important to remain strong.
[02:56:10.239 --> 02:56:14.341]  They're going to do absolutely everything they can to grind you down and make you not want to fight.
[02:56:31.124 --> 02:56:33.165]  I want my freedom to be protected.
[02:56:33.165 --> 02:56:39.007]  I plan on getting married in a few weeks, and I plan to have a bunch of kids, and I want my kids to grow up free.
[02:56:39.007 --> 02:56:40.287]  That is what I want for the future.
[02:56:40.287 --> 02:56:52.691]  It might not happen in my lifetime, but maybe a few generations down the line, if we raise our kids to be freedom-loving patriots, then that will build a better future for everyone.
[02:56:52.691 --> 02:56:54.112]  I want the authoritarians out.
[02:56:54.652 --> 02:56:57.694]  I want the authoritarians out, and I want freedom-loving patriots in.
[02:56:57.694 --> 02:57:03.439]  Because that's the only way that everyone is going to be happy, and it's going to make life worth living.
[02:57:03.439 --> 02:57:06.441]  Count Dangula, you've got to come back sooner than just once a year.
[02:57:06.441 --> 02:57:11.585]  And you were smart and focused a few years ago when you were on, but you were kind of laughing, and it was funny, I think, then.
[02:57:11.585 --> 02:57:16.108]  Am I right to say you've gotten more hardcore, what you've gone through now, and being out there running for office and being attacked?
[02:57:17.461 --> 02:57:19.262]  It's just that I like to make jokes.
[02:57:19.262 --> 02:57:20.902]  I like to, you know, you know what I'm like.
[02:57:20.902 --> 02:57:22.323]  I'm a shit poster.
[02:57:22.323 --> 02:57:24.843]  I like to make memes and annoy people and all that type of stuff.
[02:57:24.843 --> 02:57:32.746]  But whenever we get on to the subject of freedom of speech, it's difficult for me to not get serious and get very, very worried.
[02:57:32.746 --> 02:57:38.127]  Because I know I realize I like to joke about everything, but to me, freedom of speech is not a joke.
[02:57:38.127 --> 02:57:38.547]  Hold on.
[02:57:38.547 --> 02:57:39.448]  Freedom of speech is not a joke.
[02:57:39.448 --> 02:57:40.068]  We're back in two minutes.
[02:57:40.068 --> 02:57:41.688]  Do five more minutes with us ahead of Paul.
[02:57:41.688 --> 02:57:43.429]  I want to be able to finish on this critical point.
[02:57:47.729 --> 02:57:57.134]  One of the most incredible cups of coffee can be found in the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers have spent years perfecting their techniques.
[02:57:57.134 --> 02:58:08.159]  Based on hundreds of years of traditional techniques and perfect conditions, we've sourced only the best to provide you with our immune support and Wake Up America Patriot Blend coffee.
[02:58:08.539 --> 02:58:14.484]  Ancient Mayan knowledge is paired with the natural fertility of the land to generate the world's finest coffee beans.

[02:58:48.263 --> 02:58:50.124]  Mike in New Jersey, you're on the air.
[02:58:50.124 --> 02:58:51.005]  Thanks for calling, Mike.
[02:58:51.005 --> 02:58:52.366]  You are the man, Alex.
[02:58:52.366 --> 02:58:53.887]  I'm so glad to be talking to you.
[02:58:53.887 --> 02:58:54.667]  I'm so excited.
[02:58:54.667 --> 02:58:55.568]  I'm such a big fan.
[02:58:55.568 --> 02:58:58.069]  Ever since I've been listening, I've been buying your products.
[02:58:58.069 --> 02:59:00.571]  I gotta do a shout-out for the Bone Broth.
[02:59:00.571 --> 02:59:01.992]  The Bone Broth.
[02:59:01.992 --> 02:59:03.432]  The Bone Broth.
[02:59:03.432 --> 02:59:04.593]  The B-B-B-Bone Broth.
[02:59:04.593 --> 02:59:06.074]  The B-B-B-Bone Broth.
[02:59:06.074 --> 02:59:09.316]  Tastes like, tastes like, um, great milkshake.
[02:59:09.316 --> 02:59:10.837]  You know, if you just add it to milk.
[02:59:10.837 --> 02:59:11.998]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[02:59:11.998 --> 02:59:13.439]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[02:59:13.439 --> 02:59:14.880]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[02:59:14.880 --> 02:59:15.320]  Like...
[02:59:15.680 --> 02:59:16.320]  Good!
[02:59:16.320 --> 02:59:16.901]  Whoa!
[02:59:16.901 --> 02:59:18.622]  I feel great since I've been taking it.
[02:59:18.622 --> 02:59:22.805]  My daughter uses the Bubble Gum Fluoride Free Toothpaste.
[02:59:22.805 --> 02:59:26.588]  I've used the Super Male Vitality, a host of other products.
[02:59:26.588 --> 02:59:28.629]  So thank you so much for that as well.
[02:59:28.629 --> 02:59:31.211]  Brother, you're thanking me for buying the products and keeping us on air.
[02:59:31.211 --> 02:59:31.952]  I'm thanking you.
[02:59:31.952 --> 02:59:38.417]  But yes, this is the ultimate bone broth formula with the turmeric, the chaga mushroom, the true bone broth.
[02:59:38.417 --> 02:59:39.237]  It is next level.
[02:59:39.237 --> 02:59:39.798]  It really is good.
[02:59:39.798 --> 02:59:40.338]  So thank you.
[02:59:40.338 --> 02:59:42.279]  I feel great since I've been taking it.
[02:59:42.279 --> 02:59:42.660]  Thank you.
[02:59:48.726 --> 02:59:55.472]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:55.472 --> 02:59:57.433]  And we're gonna ride.
[02:59:57.433 --> 02:59:58.354]  We're gonna ride.
[02:59:58.354 --> 03:00:00.416]  Ride like a one-eyed jack-o-lantern.
[03:00:00.416 --> 03:00:02.537]  With the devil close behind.
[03:00:02.537 --> 03:00:04.659]  We're gonna ride.
[03:00:04.659 --> 03:00:05.940]  Count Dankula.
[03:00:05.940 --> 03:00:06.501]  Isn't it funny?
[03:00:06.501 --> 03:00:08.342]  We're sitting here.
[03:00:18.755 --> 03:00:24.780]  Watching all of our basic liberties that the West was known for across the planet be erased in front of our eyes.
[03:00:24.780 --> 03:00:31.345]  We're watching armies of hateful foaming at the mouth leftists.
[03:00:31.345 --> 03:00:33.086]  Oh, we can't ignore Waylon Jennings.
[03:00:33.086 --> 03:00:38.050]  Just for a second.
[03:00:38.050 --> 03:00:40.512]  Just a touch of sadness in her fingers.
[03:00:40.512 --> 03:00:43.134]  The best part, thunder and lightning.
[03:00:48.618 --> 03:00:52.622]  It's good stuff.
[03:00:52.622 --> 03:00:54.865]  What's he talking about there?
[03:00:54.865 --> 03:01:01.311]  Count Dankula, you were getting into heavy stuff about about to get married, want to have kids, and it reminds me of that Silent Running song.
[03:01:02.545 --> 03:01:06.849]  Whatever the name of it is about, you know, we have to train our sons and daughters to one day rise back up.
[03:01:06.849 --> 03:01:08.550]  The left got into power.
[03:01:08.550 --> 03:01:09.831]  They're authoritarians.
[03:01:09.831 --> 03:01:11.493]  Now they're trying to oppress us.
[03:01:11.493 --> 03:01:13.414]  And now they want to break up our families.
[03:01:13.414 --> 03:01:17.237]  They've said that in the news so that we can never again rise up against them.
[03:01:17.237 --> 03:01:20.200]  What a horrible, evil, final revolution.
[03:01:20.200 --> 03:01:24.343]  Humans raised in dormitories, you know, like chickens having their eggs taken.
[03:01:24.343 --> 03:01:26.145]  It's just so evil.
[03:01:27.634 --> 03:01:30.077]  They want absolute servitude.
[03:01:30.077 --> 03:01:31.418]  That's what they want.
[03:01:31.418 --> 03:01:39.407]  Speech is the strongest weapon that you can use against them because it's so effective at discrediting the things that they are asking for.
[03:01:39.407 --> 03:01:39.988]  For example, see
[03:01:41.664 --> 03:01:42.364]  I don't understand.
[03:01:42.364 --> 03:01:44.526]  The old left used to defend freedom of speech.
[03:01:44.526 --> 03:01:49.408]  They understood its importance because of all the amazing things that speech was able to do.
[03:01:49.408 --> 03:01:52.490]  It's speaking truth to power and correcting wrongs in the world.
[03:01:52.490 --> 03:01:53.490]  Slavery ended.
[03:01:53.490 --> 03:01:54.991]  The civil rights movement.
[03:01:54.991 --> 03:01:55.911]  Women got the vote.
[03:01:55.911 --> 03:01:59.053]  All of these things were achieved through people using their power of speech.
[03:01:59.153 --> 03:01:59.593]  I think?
[03:02:17.202 --> 03:02:20.405]  All of these places, you know, Stalin, Hitler, they all did the same thing.
[03:02:20.405 --> 03:02:21.846]  They all did the exact same thing.
[03:02:21.846 --> 03:02:29.193]  The first thing they went after was speech because they didn't want people being instructed of how bad their ideas were, which would turn people against them.
[03:02:29.193 --> 03:02:31.194]  That's the government's biggest fear.
[03:02:31.194 --> 03:02:35.798]  Truth is the government's biggest fear, which is why they want to stop people speaking the truth.
[03:02:35.798 --> 03:02:39.922]  And that means they're going to come after your rights, which is just so immorally bankrupt.
[03:02:39.922 --> 03:02:41.203]  But they're fine with doing it.
[03:02:41.203 --> 03:02:42.004]  They're quite happy.
[03:02:42.384 --> 03:02:42.885]  Thank you.
[03:03:00.102 --> 03:03:03.386]  Well, when you get around them, like, put that feminist back on screen for TV viewers.
[03:03:03.386 --> 03:03:07.071]  She says families are bad, get rid of them, have the state raise everyone.
[03:03:07.071 --> 03:03:10.295]  Well, statistics show babies die that don't have a mother holding them.
[03:03:10.295 --> 03:03:11.416]  They just don't thrive.
[03:03:11.416 --> 03:03:12.538]  IQs plummet.
[03:03:12.538 --> 03:03:14.400]  But you look at her, and I've studied most leftists.
[03:03:14.921 --> 03:03:16.622]  Most of them had a single parent.
[03:03:16.622 --> 03:03:18.102]  They were raised in dirty cribs.
[03:03:18.102 --> 03:03:20.203]  They have malnourished brains.
[03:03:20.203 --> 03:03:25.705]  And they all have that weird, sick, demonic, little snicker-snacker smile, like they're gremlins.
[03:03:25.705 --> 03:03:27.706]  They're just there to sabotage things.
[03:03:27.706 --> 03:03:29.767]  And if you talk to them, they actually admit it.
[03:03:29.767 --> 03:03:31.788]  They're just pissed that some people had parents.
[03:03:34.732 --> 03:03:39.917]  I'm sorry, the family unit is the way that we've operated for hundreds of thousands of years.
[03:03:39.917 --> 03:03:40.918]  It is effective.
[03:03:40.918 --> 03:03:44.061]  We got to where we are given the family unit.
[03:03:44.061 --> 03:03:52.509]  Kids need parents, kids need to be nurtured, kids need to be cared for by someone that has a genetic and loving bond between them.
[03:03:52.509 --> 03:03:56.773]  I'm aware I've had friends who have been raised in foster care and they are
[03:03:57.333 --> 03:03:58.354]  In and out of prison.
[03:03:58.354 --> 03:03:59.294]  They are in and out of prison.
[03:03:59.294 --> 03:04:00.795]  They never had any kind of father figure.
[03:04:00.795 --> 03:04:02.276]  They never had any kind of mother figure.
[03:04:02.276 --> 03:04:08.721]  All they had was the faceless state, you know, getting swapped between, you know, different social workers and different homes all the time.
[03:04:08.721 --> 03:04:09.221]  They had no safety.
[03:04:09.221 --> 03:04:10.982]  Exactly, and they want that for everybody.
[03:04:10.982 --> 03:04:12.924]  We're not putting down single parents.
[03:04:12.924 --> 03:04:14.465]  The system is admittedly built.
[03:04:14.465 --> 03:04:16.566]  It was tested on blacks first.
[03:04:16.566 --> 03:04:17.286]  It's been done.
[03:04:17.286 --> 03:04:18.607]  It's pure evil.
[03:04:18.607 --> 03:04:23.671]  At Count Dankula TV on Twitter, YouTube, Count Dankula while he's still there.
[03:04:23.671 --> 03:04:24.711]  Everybody check him out.
[03:04:24.711 --> 03:04:26.012]  Thank you for all the time, my friend.
[03:04:26.012 --> 03:04:26.813]  We really appreciate you.
[03:04:27.731 --> 03:04:29.173]  No problem, good to be back.
[03:04:29.173 --> 03:04:34.940]  Count Dankula, the tip of the spear, arrested for free speech in the UK, running for office.
[03:04:34.940 --> 03:04:38.304]  There's nothing more tip of the spear than free speech.
[03:04:38.304 --> 03:04:44.331]  Nothing more tip of the spear than going out and demonstrating, and have his imamesis, funded by the government, throw bricks at you.
[03:04:44.331 --> 03:04:46.093]  That's courage, and we salute him.
[03:04:46.093 --> 03:04:46.674]  We'll be right back.
[03:04:54.475 --> 03:04:56.356]  They've not shut down our speech!
[03:04:56.356 --> 03:05:01.437]  We're at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com, and we're defeating the leftist tyrants!
[03:05:01.437 --> 03:05:08.939]  I got mobbed on the streets by fans, but almost all of them said, we used to love you on air, it was so good to see you on the iTunes or on YouTube.
[03:05:08.939 --> 03:05:10.260]  Are you coming back?
[03:05:10.260 --> 03:05:11.420]  We're at InfoWars.com.
[03:05:12.020 --> 03:05:13.241]  We're at NewsWorks.com.
[03:05:13.241 --> 03:05:15.642]  Paul Watson's launched his own Summit.News.
[03:05:15.642 --> 03:05:16.562]  We have our own videos.
[03:05:16.562 --> 03:05:17.643]  We have our own articles.
[03:05:17.643 --> 03:05:22.405]  They're trying to destroy us, but thanks to you and others having us on, InfoWars is still chugging along.
[03:05:22.405 --> 03:05:24.846]  So we're there, folks, tomorrow's news, today.
[03:05:24.846 --> 03:05:26.287]  InfoWars!
[03:05:26.287 --> 03:05:27.908]  Let's go, man!
[03:05:27.908 --> 03:05:28.268]  Woo!
[03:05:31.002 --> 03:05:33.783]  Infowars.com, because that's a bunch of people out here.
[03:05:33.783 --> 03:05:35.584]  I'm talking about Infowars.com.
[03:05:35.584 --> 03:05:38.646]  I'm at Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[03:05:38.646 --> 03:05:40.527]  We knew this censorship was coming forever.
[03:05:40.527 --> 03:05:44.049]  We have our own video streams, our own audio streams, and it's all free to air.
[03:05:44.049 --> 03:05:46.790]  Anybody can use it, re-upload it, do whatever you want.
[03:05:46.790 --> 03:05:48.871]  People go to Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[03:05:48.871 --> 03:05:49.832]  That's where they find it.
[03:05:49.832 --> 03:05:52.033]  You know, there's things called websites.
[03:05:52.033 --> 03:05:52.453]  Just go there.
[03:06:06.855 --> 03:06:11.198]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[03:06:11.198 --> 03:06:25.129]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:06:25.129 --> 03:06:26.510]  Riders of the storm...
[03:06:29.938 --> 03:06:36.021]  I believe he needs a guitar with an incredible tongue like that.
[03:06:36.021 --> 03:06:37.082]  Being sarcastic.
[03:06:37.082 --> 03:06:39.383]  My tongue's good for nothing.
[03:06:39.383 --> 03:06:40.763]  Oh, I've not been told that.
[03:06:40.763 --> 03:06:41.024]  Yeah!
[03:06:41.024 --> 03:06:43.985]  Actually, my tongue does a lot of things.
[03:06:57.028 --> 03:06:59.831]  His brain is squirming like a toad.
[03:06:59.831 --> 03:07:01.433]  Take a long holiday.
[03:07:01.433 --> 03:07:04.697]  Take a long holiday.
[03:07:04.697 --> 03:07:05.819]  Let your children play.
[03:07:05.819 --> 03:07:07.341]  That's a really good idea.
[03:07:07.341 --> 03:07:08.562]  Let your children play.
[03:07:08.562 --> 03:07:11.546]  Because if you give these globalists a ride.
[03:07:11.546 --> 03:07:15.651]  If you give this man a ride, sweet family will die.
[03:07:17.469 --> 03:07:20.650]  The Whore Room's coming up in T-minus 53 minutes.
[03:07:20.650 --> 03:07:29.874]  Paul Joseph Watson from London, England, London-stan, is going to be joining us here and taking over.
[03:07:29.874 --> 03:07:31.735]  I got to a lot of the news.
[03:07:31.735 --> 03:07:33.876]  A lot of it I didn't get to.
[03:07:33.876 --> 03:07:36.777]  And I may shoot a special report later on this.
[03:07:36.777 --> 03:07:41.639]  Trump hits Fox News at PA Rally.
[03:07:41.639 --> 03:07:44.360]  Says something's very strange going on there.
[03:07:44.360 --> 03:07:44.560]  Yes.
[03:07:47.125 --> 03:07:51.627]  They're having rigged town halls with people praising the most socialist candidates.
[03:07:51.627 --> 03:07:58.650]  They're sniping at Trump everywhere because the neocons intend to try to beat Trump in 2020.
[03:07:58.650 --> 03:08:02.272]  They intend on sabotaging him and removing him with the Democrats.
[03:08:02.272 --> 03:08:07.714]  But right now they're telling you, oh, Trump's a shoo-in in the news, so everybody goes to sleep.
[03:08:07.714 --> 03:08:10.055]  That is not what's happening.
[03:08:10.055 --> 03:08:12.176]  I think there's four things that can derail Trump.
[03:08:12.176 --> 03:08:15.718]  The Federal Reserve's attempt to sabotage of the borders.
[03:08:17.125 --> 03:08:28.654]  They're tipping sabotage of the situation with the Federal Reserve, the private Federal Reserve, trying to trick Trump into getting into a war.
[03:08:28.654 --> 03:08:29.975]  Think about it.
[03:08:29.975 --> 03:08:38.142]  And of course, massive election fraud, election meddling, the censorship, all of it goes together.
[03:08:38.142 --> 03:08:41.244]  What a time to be alive.
[03:08:41.244 --> 03:08:44.086]  Meanwhile, I didn't get to this news.
[03:08:44.086 --> 03:08:45.727]  Maybe I'll go co-host the War Room today.
[03:08:46.690 --> 03:08:50.551]  Geologist says Yellowstone eruption would destroy most of the United States.
[03:08:50.551 --> 03:08:53.232]  That's a newswars.com story.
[03:08:53.232 --> 03:09:05.616]  Also, another story out of the sun, NASA plans for permanent lunar outposts, secret, now leaked, and 37 rocket launchers on the moon, leaked online.
[03:09:05.616 --> 03:09:14.479]  Look at this, French town offers free Viagra to boost birth rate because the French have 1.3 replacement rate for every two adults, 1.3 children.
[03:09:16.383 --> 03:09:18.985]  And again, I understand there's a clash of civilization with the Muslims.
[03:09:18.985 --> 03:09:19.786]  I don't want wars.
[03:09:19.786 --> 03:09:21.047]  I didn't want the Arab Spring.
[03:09:21.047 --> 03:09:22.348]  I didn't want the wars in the Middle East.
[03:09:22.348 --> 03:09:23.109]  I don't want the new ones.
[03:09:23.109 --> 03:09:27.213]  Because they try to trick Trump into a new war.
[03:09:27.213 --> 03:09:29.034]  That's one of the four pillars we don't want.
[03:09:29.034 --> 03:09:34.819]  But it doesn't matter when they're bringing in the most radical Muslims and the media covers up their attacks like Somalis with hammers.
[03:09:35.865 --> 03:09:37.466]  Let's play that audio in a moment.
[03:09:37.466 --> 03:09:42.830]  Attacking people at a Minnesota train station because they were white and then almost no media coverage.
[03:09:42.830 --> 03:09:45.912]  Imagine a group of whites running around beating blacks.
[03:09:45.912 --> 03:09:47.973]  But this wasn't really blacks attacking whites.
[03:09:47.973 --> 03:09:51.375]  This was Islamicists attacking.
[03:09:51.375 --> 03:09:56.218]  Mob with hammers descends on Minneapolis East Bank LRT.
[03:09:56.218 --> 03:09:58.460]  Here's some of the police scanner audio.
[03:09:59.724 --> 03:10:00.325]  We're good to go.
[03:10:23.109 --> 03:10:25.811]  That's just a regular occurrence now in Minneapolis, St.
[03:10:25.811 --> 03:10:27.072]  Paul.
[03:10:27.072 --> 03:10:29.553]  The network that streams our satellites is up there.
[03:10:29.553 --> 03:10:31.214]  I've been there many times.
[03:10:31.214 --> 03:10:35.157]  And let's just say that it's not a lot of fun to be hunted.
[03:10:35.157 --> 03:10:37.539]  But the Somalis know that no one will stop them.
[03:10:37.539 --> 03:10:43.943]  Even Somali police officers just randomly shoot women.
[03:10:43.943 --> 03:10:44.864]  I mean, go to Somalia.
[03:10:44.864 --> 03:10:46.064]  It's the same way.
[03:10:46.064 --> 03:10:47.625]  Very, very sad.
[03:10:47.625 --> 03:10:49.987]  The Somalis don't get along with any of their other Muslim neighbors either.
[03:10:49.987 --> 03:10:51.768]  It's a really, really sad thing.
[03:10:51.768 --> 03:10:52.809]  But we've got our Somali
[03:10:54.051 --> 03:10:58.278]  Our Somali leader now, who says America sucks, Ilhan Omar.
[03:10:58.278 --> 03:10:59.641]  Okay, I'm gonna end it with that.
[03:10:59.641 --> 03:11:02.346]  Please don't forget, without you, we're bye-bye.
[03:11:02.346 --> 03:11:03.708]  And they're really pissed that we're still here.
[03:11:04.654 --> 03:11:07.757]  We built a platform other than their systems.
[03:11:07.757 --> 03:11:09.940]  So everybody else that gives the platform is bye-bye.
[03:11:09.940 --> 03:11:18.849]  But we're a mothership now, promoting, expanding, boosting, amplifying all those other voices against our enslavement.
[03:11:18.849 --> 03:11:22.492]  And that's why we have the special that's running, our new special.
[03:11:22.492 --> 03:11:27.297]  We have the Memorial Day special, 60% off, extender-wise, for the
[03:11:28.967 --> 03:11:31.089]  Cardiovascular system in the heart.
[03:11:31.089 --> 03:11:34.752]  MycoZX that knocks out the fungus and mold and candida in the gut.

[03:11:37.274 --> 03:11:38.355]  Incredible deal.

[03:12:09.996 --> 03:12:14.699]  These are $3 a piece and on sales price even less when you get the box of them.
[03:12:15.499 --> 03:12:18.961]  So info or score.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:12:18.961 --> 03:12:30.908]  Turning it now over to Paul Joseph Watson, who's now joined the ranks of the D platforms on Facebook as a global hate leader.
[03:12:30.908 --> 03:12:32.629]  You don't run any slave camps in China like...
[03:12:33.670 --> 03:12:37.652]  Tim Cook, or you don't, you know, help round up the dissidents like Google does in China.
[03:12:37.652 --> 03:12:40.773]  That's why you're a hate leader, because you don't want the technocracy.
[03:12:40.773 --> 03:12:45.934]  So, again, I wanted to renounce you and just say you're a horrible person, Paul.
[03:12:45.934 --> 03:12:47.915]  Thanks for hosting.
[03:12:47.915 --> 03:12:49.196]  Thanks, Alex.
[03:12:49.196 --> 03:12:50.836]  Yeah, it's interesting, isn't it?
[03:12:50.836 --> 03:13:00.980]  I'm labeled the hateful one, and yet every single day we have more and more examples of the real hate being directed towards the people who are smeared and libeled as hateful.
[03:13:01.892 --> 03:13:15.195]  And that has come to the fore over the past couple of days, especially in the UK, where we've had this entire narrative about people getting doused with milkshakes, and people on the left saying, oh it's just a milkshake, lol, you mad bro?
[03:13:15.928 --> 03:13:28.858]  These are the same people who will literally have temper tantrums and wet the bed over, in one case, somebody shouting a mean word at a pro-EU politician called Anna Soubry, which happened in London a few months ago.
[03:13:28.858 --> 03:13:32.381]  There was a week-long media hysteria campaign about it.
[03:13:32.381 --> 03:13:41.868]  The individual who shouted the slur, calling her a Nazi, because we can't call them Nazis, they could call us Nazis all day long, the individual was doxxed
[03:13:42.791 --> 03:13:44.333]  His entire life was exposed.
[03:13:44.333 --> 03:13:45.775]  He was banned from London.
[03:13:45.775 --> 03:13:49.440]  He can't even come back into London to attend protests now.
[03:13:49.440 --> 03:13:56.309]  So there was a week-long pearl-clutching hissy fit over him shouting a mean word at a pro-EU politician.
[03:13:56.309 --> 03:13:57.451]  But then they can walk around
[03:13:58.132 --> 03:14:07.498]  Major cities all day long throwing milkshakes at Nigel Farage, throwing milkshakes at Tommy Robinson and Carl Benjamin, and it's, oh it's just a milkshake!
[03:14:07.498 --> 03:14:10.280]  So again, it's okay when we do it.
[03:14:10.280 --> 03:14:21.028]  And yesterday, after Farage got milkshaked in Newcastle, people were coming out on Twitter and saying, oh milkshakes are not enough, now we need acid attacks.
[03:14:21.028 --> 03:14:25.611]  But I'm the hateful one, I'm the one who gets banned, and you can see the headline up there now from summit.news,
[03:14:26.272 --> 03:14:30.014]  Leftist advocates acid-attacking Nigel Farage.
[03:14:30.014 --> 03:14:43.923]  This was a left-wing activist, because further down in the article we have this same woman appearing at a protest a couple of years ago, shouting at protesters, a gaze against Sharia March, and she's got the typical look.
[03:14:43.923 --> 03:14:45.804]  Ugly, out-of-shape, ginger.
[03:14:45.804 --> 03:14:48.426]  They all seem to have this same look, to one degree or another.
[03:14:49.773 --> 03:14:58.497]  She tweeted immediately after, or shortly after the Milkshake attack on Farage, which is assault, people have been arrested for it, that's assault.
[03:14:58.497 --> 03:15:03.499]  She tweeted, great that milkshakes have become a thing when it comes to the racists in our midst.
[03:15:03.499 --> 03:15:08.362]  I'd prefer acid, but milkshakes will do for now.
[03:15:08.362 --> 03:15:10.523]  This is a woman.
[03:15:10.523 --> 03:15:13.124]  And you can see her there with the red crazy hair.
[03:15:13.124 --> 03:15:16.245]  Looks not much of a looker, to be polite.
[03:15:16.245 --> 03:15:17.206]  Is that Elizabeth Warren?
[03:15:19.457 --> 03:15:25.039]  This is a woman who works for a charity, this left-wing charity called Happy City.
[03:15:25.039 --> 03:15:32.363]  And she's literally calling for a major politician who is about to win an EU election to be acid-attacked.
[03:15:32.363 --> 03:15:35.224]  This is the age of mass hysteria that we live in.
[03:15:35.224 --> 03:15:36.665]  And I'm going to get into more examples.
[03:15:36.665 --> 03:15:38.685]  And you know if you did that, you'd be arrested, Paul.
[03:15:38.685 --> 03:15:39.766]  If you did that, you'd be arrested.
[03:15:40.842 --> 03:15:43.809]  Yeah, I'd be de-platformed arrested within an hour.
[03:15:43.809 --> 03:15:45.252]  They can get away with it.
[03:15:45.252 --> 03:15:46.595]  And it's only getting worse, Alex.
[03:15:46.595 --> 03:15:48.118]  I'm gonna get into it more after the break.
[03:15:48.118 --> 03:15:50.624]  By the way, she looks like Hit the Clown meets Elizabeth Warren.
[03:15:50.624 --> 03:15:51.085]  Thank you, Paul.
[03:15:53.459 --> 03:15:54.680]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:15:54.680 --> 03:15:58.602]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:15:58.602 --> 03:16:00.143]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:16:00.143 --> 03:16:03.084]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:16:03.084 --> 03:16:08.647]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:16:08.647 --> 03:16:09.848]  I can help you, too.
[03:16:09.848 --> 03:16:12.790]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[03:16:12.790 --> 03:16:15.011]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[03:16:15.011 --> 03:16:19.453]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX, or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[03:16:19.453 --> 03:16:21.794]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[03:16:22.995 --> 03:16:29.358]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[03:16:29.358 --> 03:16:32.379]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[03:16:32.379 --> 03:16:38.321]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[03:16:38.321 --> 03:16:42.103]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[03:16:42.103 --> 03:16:43.363]  Was there ever a vote?
[03:16:43.363 --> 03:16:44.704]  Who do we fight for?
[03:16:44.704 --> 03:16:50.906]  The deep state began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[03:16:50.906 --> 03:16:52.347]  Available at Amazon Books.
[03:16:53.004 --> 03:16:55.226]  Okay, so a watch is good, and some jewelry.
[03:16:55.226 --> 03:16:56.528]  Better grab some flowers, too.
[03:16:56.528 --> 03:16:57.509]  Hey, whatcha doin'?

[03:17:59.516 --> 03:18:10.787]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[03:18:11.568 --> 03:18:20.755]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[03:18:20.755 --> 03:18:26.540]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[03:18:26.540 --> 03:18:31.824]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[03:18:31.824 --> 03:18:34.066]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[03:18:34.406 --> 03:18:36.127]  It is not an antihistamine.
[03:18:36.127 --> 03:18:46.132]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[03:18:46.132 --> 03:18:48.793]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe!
[03:18:48.793 --> 03:18:53.496]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[03:18:54.423 --> 03:18:58.985]  Stacey in the great state of Texas in FEMA Region 6.
[03:18:58.985 --> 03:19:01.007]  You're on the air worldwide, Stacey.
[03:19:01.007 --> 03:19:02.107]  Good to talk to you.
[03:19:02.107 --> 03:19:06.750]  Before I get into what I want to say, I just want to let you know that I don't normally take vitamins at all.
[03:19:06.750 --> 03:19:08.691]  I was turned on to the ultimate female force.
[03:19:08.691 --> 03:19:13.233]  I looked at all the ingredients and they're all organic, root, things like that, that I trust.
[03:19:13.533 --> 03:19:15.595]  You know, because I've seen a lot of other vitamins.
[03:19:15.595 --> 03:19:17.878]  They don't have things that they say that they have in them.
[03:19:17.878 --> 03:19:19.500]  And they're often not things that are natural.
[03:19:19.500 --> 03:19:20.260]  I appreciate that.
[03:19:20.260 --> 03:19:21.882]  Well, what happened with Ultimate Female Force?
[03:19:21.882 --> 03:19:22.483]  Tell us about it.
[03:19:22.483 --> 03:19:23.264]  Well, it's really great.
[03:19:23.264 --> 03:19:24.545]  You know, it's like a multivitamin.
[03:19:24.545 --> 03:19:25.065]  I take it.
[03:19:25.065 --> 03:19:25.806]  It tastes good.
[03:19:25.806 --> 03:19:27.668]  It doesn't have that nasty aftertaste.
[03:19:27.668 --> 03:19:29.630]  It actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste.
[03:19:29.630 --> 03:19:32.253]  And, you know, it just gives me energy and fuels me throughout the day.
[03:19:32.253 --> 03:19:33.074]  So I really like it.
[03:19:33.114 --> 03:19:35.935]  Well, just so you know, we look at whatever the best herbs are.
[03:19:35.935 --> 03:19:37.695]  They're known to turbocharge women.
[03:19:37.695 --> 03:19:39.776]  And then we get the organic ones and put it in it.
[03:19:39.776 --> 03:19:43.137]  So yeah, stamina, libido, energy.
[03:19:43.137 --> 03:19:45.958]  These are amazing things and ultimate female force.
[03:19:45.958 --> 03:19:47.118]  So I'm glad you plugged it.
[03:19:47.118 --> 03:19:48.198]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:19:48.198 --> 03:19:49.599]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:14.316 --> 03:20:21.347]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:21.347 --> 03:20:25.153]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:20:27.162 --> 03:20:40.751]  I think the major difference in terms of how political violence is being normalized is that the right never advocates or endorses political violence, not the center right or what you may call the mainstream right.
[03:20:40.751 --> 03:20:50.657]  Whereas the so-called mainstream left, which has now increasingly become the fringe left as it gets more hysterical, has consistently endorsed violence.
[03:20:50.657 --> 03:20:56.521]  And we saw this again in the aftermath of Nigel Farage having a milkshake thrown over him in Newcastle.
[03:20:57.119 --> 03:21:01.145]  Well, you literally had independent headlines.
[03:21:01.145 --> 03:21:04.149]  The Independent's a big left-wing newspaper in the UK.
[03:21:04.149 --> 03:21:08.775]  Nigel Farage getting hit by a milkshake isn't funny, it's absolutely hilarious.
[03:21:08.775 --> 03:21:12.781]  Again, these are the same people who try and make this warped argument
[03:21:13.729 --> 03:21:18.190]  The opinions they disagree with, speech, is violence.
[03:21:18.190 --> 03:21:33.355]  You've seen that in the universities at the academic level and you've seen it in the culture where right-wing opinions, or basically at this point any opinion that diverges from their mantra, is violence and therefore it needs to be banned because it's hate.
[03:21:33.355 --> 03:21:33.875]  Meanwhile,
[03:21:34.767 --> 03:21:52.662]  So they've tried to redefine opinions which they disagree with, speech as violence, meanwhile they're trying to define actual violence that they carry out, assaults, while endorsing it in the media as just another form of speech that should be deemed acceptable.
[03:21:52.662 --> 03:21:54.183]  It's not acceptable.
[03:21:54.183 --> 03:22:00.348]  All political violence is bad, whether left or right, it should be denounced across the board.
[03:22:00.348 --> 03:22:01.509]  I'm going to get more into this.
[03:22:01.509 --> 03:22:03.711]  To preface it though, I think it's good to play this clip.
[03:22:04.344 --> 03:22:14.914]  I sent to the studio, which is my reaction to this whole milkshaking meme as it came to a head yesterday, which is in a video that I've put out about the European elections.
[03:22:14.914 --> 03:22:16.576]  So let's go ahead and roll that video now.
[03:22:16.576 --> 03:22:24.123]  Oh, do you think you are kidding, Mr Young?
[03:22:28.905 --> 03:22:33.809]  So three years after voting to leave the EU, we're voting in EU elections.
[03:22:33.809 --> 03:22:34.909]  Funny that, isn't it?
[03:22:34.909 --> 03:22:39.633]  I've just got a feeling they're going to keep on voting until they get the answer they want.
[03:22:39.633 --> 03:22:50.742]  It's almost like the EU is a Byzantine corrupt authoritarian dictatorship that's so mafia-like it doesn't allow countries to leave and laughs about turning them into colonies.
[03:22:50.742 --> 03:22:52.603]  We finally turned them into a colony.
[03:22:56.205 --> 03:22:58.727]  Who wouldn't want to be part of that?
[03:22:58.727 --> 03:23:05.991]  Yeah that is the Euro election special video which is up on my YouTube channel.
[03:23:05.991 --> 03:23:10.073]  Everyone needs to get that right now and share it on Facebook.
[03:23:10.073 --> 03:23:16.036]  There was a specific clip within that video which I think you've got at the studio so let me know when you've got it.
[03:23:16.036 --> 03:23:19.578]  But it relates to the whole milkshaking thing and again
[03:23:21.112 --> 03:23:28.335]  People on the left, this is an argument I've heard in the aftermath of this, they say, oh, but what about the New Zealand mosque shooter?
[03:23:28.335 --> 03:23:30.756]  What about these right-wing violent attacks?
[03:23:30.756 --> 03:23:38.360]  The difference is, we denounce those attacks, the left-wing media endorses its own brand of political violence.
[03:23:38.360 --> 03:23:41.882]  You've seen that with Antifa over the years.
[03:23:41.882 --> 03:23:49.125]  I think it's a miracle, to be honest, that we haven't seen a mass casualty attack in any developed country
[03:23:49.907 --> 03:23:59.872]  By a left-wing extremist, because they are being radicalized on the internet by these even mainstream left-wing publications that are saying that violence is now acceptable.
[03:23:59.872 --> 03:24:11.959]  I reported on a thwarted attack last Christmas, I think it was, it was the Pier 69 massacre, intended massacre, by a left-wing extremist, by one of these typical Antifa types.
[03:24:12.873 --> 03:24:14.656]  That was thwarted at the last minute.
[03:24:14.656 --> 03:24:19.643]  He literally planned to massacre dozens of people on Pier 69 in San Francisco.
[03:24:19.643 --> 03:24:22.667]  Of course, we had James T. Hodgkinson.
[03:24:22.667 --> 03:24:27.213]  Again, a miracle that he didn't massacre a bunch of Republican congressmen.
[03:24:27.213 --> 03:24:29.817]  We had the transgender school shooter last week.
[03:24:30.467 --> 03:24:34.749]  Who, with another anti-Trump individual, tried to shoot up a school.
[03:24:34.749 --> 03:24:37.790]  Killed one person, I think injured several more.
[03:24:37.790 --> 03:24:40.491]  Again, lucky that that wasn't a larger attack.
[03:24:40.491 --> 03:24:45.554]  So you do have violent attacks on the left, which cause casualties and cause deaths.
[03:24:45.554 --> 03:24:47.094]  Media doesn't report on them.
[03:24:47.094 --> 03:24:49.976]  They drop them like a hot potato within hours.
[03:24:49.976 --> 03:24:57.679]  But it's a miracle that there haven't been more, given the amount of radicalization that we see going on on the left.
[03:24:57.679 --> 03:24:59.700]  And again, the point is that the left-wing media
[03:25:01.107 --> 03:25:09.790]  endorses it, tacitly endorses it and says that it's acceptable, oh because they're all fascists and Nazis because they've dehumanized everyone on the right.
[03:25:09.790 --> 03:25:29.197]  Let's not forget, back in 2002, the Dutch politician Pim Fortuyn, who was a gay Dutch populist, who was about to win the election if memory serves, he was about to win the election in the Netherlands, he was hit by a cake, somebody threw a cake over his head,
[03:25:30.163 --> 03:25:39.552]  Two months later he was shot dead, shot in the head by a left-wing environmentalist extremist right before the Dutch election.
[03:25:39.552 --> 03:25:44.416]  So to claim that there are no examples of this on the left and in fact that this
[03:25:45.589 --> 03:26:06.781]  Legitimization of milkshaking or throwing cakes over people's heads doesn't lead to greater violence is a complete misnomer because it did in the past with Pim Fortein who was literally shot in the head and assassinated shortly before the Dutch election back in 2002 by an extremist left-winger.
[03:26:06.781 --> 03:26:09.342]  Nobody talks about that anymore.
[03:26:09.342 --> 03:26:14.185]  And then we have another story which I'm going to get more into after the break because I'm going to get into depth on this.
[03:26:15.293 --> 03:26:27.622]  Well, we literally have, and this is the difference between large companies and small businesses who get on Twitter and virtue signal often for the left, in favor of the left.
[03:26:27.622 --> 03:26:38.530]  Of course, we had Nike with Colin Kaepernick and, you know, you have to believe in something to, you know, sacrifice everything, that whole slogan, which actually made them money.
[03:26:38.530 --> 03:26:39.811]  At the time, people were saying,
[03:26:40.643 --> 03:26:52.387]  On the right, we're going to boycott Nike, we're not going to buy Nike products anymore, actually led to them making money because with the virtue signaling and the avalanche of press coverage, it's free media coverage.
[03:26:52.387 --> 03:26:56.828]  It's virtue signaling via, it's free advertising via virtue signaling.
[03:26:56.828 --> 03:26:59.209]  Believe in something even if it means sacrificing everything.
[03:26:59.209 --> 03:27:04.831]  They made money from that when it came down to it.
[03:27:04.831 --> 03:27:09.072]  Gillette, on the other hand, lost a little bit of money when they came out with a whole
[03:27:09.747 --> 03:27:15.670]  You know, masculinity self-fragile attacking basic masculinity in their ad.
[03:27:15.670 --> 03:27:28.675]  But again, it's not going to move the needle very far either way with giant corporations that are making that much money to have a scandal where one side of the political argument says we're going to boycott your products.
[03:27:28.675 --> 03:27:32.897]  So get woke, go broke doesn't apply to large companies.
[03:27:33.664 --> 03:27:46.149]  And that free advertising they get from the virtue signaling is normally worth the backlash they get from the right, because the right isn't as organized in terms of mob outrage as the left is.
[03:27:46.149 --> 03:27:49.011]  So it doesn't move the needle that much.
[03:27:49.011 --> 03:27:57.314]  But then you get small businesses who decide to go online, as happened today in the United Kingdom.
[03:27:57.314 --> 03:27:58.855]  And this was absolutely incredible.
[03:27:58.855 --> 03:28:01.356]  This is the headline on summit.news.
[03:28:02.344 --> 03:28:04.044]  I'm going to get more into this after the break.
[03:28:04.044 --> 03:28:10.026]  Left-wing beer company tells customers to hit people over the head with bricks.
[03:28:10.026 --> 03:28:19.908]  Now, obviously a giant corporation isn't going to do that, although Burger King, again, did tacitly endorse violence with a whole milkshaking thing, as we covered.
[03:28:19.908 --> 03:28:26.950]  But this is a tiny brewery in the north of England, in Manchester, where the owner literally gets up on Twitter.
[03:28:26.950 --> 03:28:29.091]  And we got a screenshot there.
[03:28:29.091 --> 03:28:30.571]  They deleted it within a few hours.
[03:28:31.690 --> 03:28:34.491]  Saying, please don't throw our beer over fascists.
[03:28:34.491 --> 03:28:39.872]  Obviously, the term fascist is now so diluted that it's anyone on the right.
[03:28:39.872 --> 03:28:43.973]  Quote, hit them over the head with a brick, as is traditional.
[03:28:43.973 --> 03:28:49.594]  We'll find out in the next segment what happened to this company in the immediate aftermath of these tweets.
[03:28:49.594 --> 03:28:52.215]  This is the Alex Jones Show live breaking news at Infowars.com.
[03:28:52.215 --> 03:28:52.635]  We'll be back.
[03:28:53.584 --> 03:28:55.565]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[03:28:55.565 --> 03:29:00.869]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[03:29:00.869 --> 03:29:02.471]  But the symptoms are there.
[03:29:02.471 --> 03:29:10.817]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[03:29:10.817 --> 03:29:16.521]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.

[03:31:53.686 --> 03:32:02.974]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[03:32:02.974 --> 03:32:05.837]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[03:32:05.837 --> 03:32:11.903]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[03:32:12.563 --> 03:32:18.808]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source, and the Globeless tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[03:32:18.808 --> 03:32:25.112]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[03:32:25.112 --> 03:32:32.037]  Now, due to the Establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[03:32:33.178 --> 03:32:34.799]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:33:09.088 --> 03:33:17.672]  Broadcasting live from the UN stronghold, Austin, Texas, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:17.672 --> 03:33:22.835]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:33:22.835 --> 03:33:25.696]  We're back live on The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:25.696 --> 03:33:33.020]  In the next segment, I'm going to get into a story which is based on a study, a new study, which basically proves what we've been saying all along.
[03:33:33.712 --> 03:33:40.416]  That YouTube's trending tab is completely rigged in favor of giant media corporations.
[03:33:40.416 --> 03:33:46.880]  They've taken the you out of YouTube and basically rigged their system, broken their search engine.
[03:33:46.880 --> 03:33:52.563]  They've rigged the trending tab and that's now been proven vehemently with this new study.
[03:33:52.563 --> 03:33:54.524]  So I'm going to get into that.
[03:33:54.524 --> 03:33:55.565]  Also going to get into this
[03:33:57.350 --> 03:34:02.711]  Small business, which has just completely destroyed its own reputation over one tweet.
[03:34:02.711 --> 03:34:05.072]  Absolutely incredible behaviour.
[03:34:05.072 --> 03:34:17.395]  To preface that though now, with this environment, this hysterical environment of the endorsement of violence, political violence, here is a clip from my video, The Truth, about the Euro elections.
[03:34:17.395 --> 03:34:20.016]  Let's roll it.
[03:34:20.016 --> 03:34:23.097]  ...quarters of this odious oligarchy conduct themselves.
[03:34:27.313 --> 03:34:37.382]  Because if you can't be bothered to craft an actual political message that resonates with voters, just throw milkshakes like toddlers having a tantrum because they wet their nappies in McDonald's.
[03:34:37.382 --> 03:34:38.543]  Yeah, good luck with that.
[03:34:38.543 --> 03:34:42.086]  That awkward moment when you run out of actual political arguments.
[03:34:42.086 --> 03:34:45.829]  Also, why do they always look like this?
[03:34:45.829 --> 03:34:48.291]  Too many soy milkshakes for this big boy.
[03:34:48.291 --> 03:34:51.014]  Still, at least he finally gets to get laid.
[03:34:52.344 --> 03:34:53.064]  In prison.
[03:34:53.064 --> 03:34:56.266]  But according to the BBC, this wasn't assault.
[03:34:56.266 --> 03:34:57.047]  No, no, no, no.
[03:34:57.047 --> 03:34:59.708]  He was just expressing his opinion.
[03:34:59.708 --> 03:35:13.595]  In his own way, a 32-year-old man who's been arrested in Newcastle today was expressing his views about the Brexit Party too, in no uncertain terms, because Nigel Farage, leader of the Brexit Party, had a milkshake thrown all over him.
[03:35:13.595 --> 03:35:15.056]  Man yells mean word at
[03:35:15.196 --> 03:35:18.899]  Your milkshakes bring all the votes to the yard and I'm like, no that's Farage.
[03:35:32.369 --> 03:35:43.295]  Maybe if you were as enthusiastic about voting as you seem to be about lobbing milkshakes at people like spoiled brats, Farage wouldn't be about to enjoy a crushing victory.
[03:35:43.295 --> 03:35:47.257]  Farage slurping on a giant milkshake in celebration on Friday morning.
[03:35:47.257 --> 03:35:48.378]  Imagine those optics.
[03:35:48.558 --> 03:35:53.181]  But it was Burger King who tacitly endorsed political violence with this tweet.
[03:35:53.181 --> 03:36:01.588]  Because nothing says grassroots organic resistance like having one of the biggest transnational corporations on the planet shill for your cause.
[03:36:01.588 --> 03:36:09.233]  Foreign multinational megacorp spreading diabetes, obesity and poor animal welfare endorses violence against British fringe politicians.
[03:36:09.233 --> 03:36:11.175]  Make sure you're on the right side.
[03:36:11.175 --> 03:36:12.035]  Let's get real.
[03:36:12.035 --> 03:36:16.939]  If right-of-center news outlets and huge corporations were tacitly endorsing assault,
[03:36:17.159 --> 03:36:19.260]  And yes, milkshaking is assault.
[03:36:19.260 --> 03:36:20.720]  People have been arrested for it.
[03:36:20.720 --> 03:36:26.102]  Against lefties, there'd be uproar, boycotts, protest marches.
[03:36:26.102 --> 03:36:31.244]  But the left behaves like that and it's all, lol snowflake, are you afraid of milkshakes?
[03:36:31.244 --> 03:36:33.125]  It's okay when we do it.
[03:36:33.125 --> 03:36:34.286]  Give me a break.
[03:36:34.286 --> 03:36:37.547]  If you lot were getting milkshaked by Brexit Party supporters,
[03:36:37.867 --> 03:36:41.830]  You'd all be having hissy fits like Nazi panzer tanks had just invaded.
[03:36:41.830 --> 03:36:44.451]  But hey bro, it's just a milkshake!
[03:36:44.451 --> 03:36:51.336]  It's not as if actual racists once poured milkshakes over the heads of black civil rights protesters, is it?
[03:36:51.336 --> 03:36:52.336]  Oh.
[03:36:52.336 --> 03:36:54.418]  It's okay when we do it!
[03:36:54.418 --> 03:37:01.782]  Those making light of milkshake assaults are the same idiots who had nervous breakdowns over someone saying mean things to Owen Jones.
[03:37:01.782 --> 03:37:02.723]  Because remember...
[03:37:03.223 --> 03:37:06.484]  Remainers are all about tolerance.
[03:37:06.484 --> 03:37:10.164]  Staying in the EU was about love.
[03:37:10.164 --> 03:37:16.225]  I mean, they're so loving, they'll literally side with Islamist thugs who throw bricks at children.
[03:37:16.225 --> 03:37:17.365]  So loving!
[03:37:17.365 --> 03:37:21.326]  But then freak out over that spicy Sargon tweet from 2016.
[03:37:21.326 --> 03:37:27.747]  Also, is it really a good idea to be normalising political violence when most of you look like this?
[03:37:27.747 --> 03:37:28.487]  Good luck with that.
[03:37:28.487 --> 03:37:32.608]  According to them, as long as the right people are being violently assaulted,
[03:37:32.908 --> 03:37:35.530]  Political violence is morally just.
[03:37:35.530 --> 03:37:39.833]  It's okay when we do it!
[03:37:39.833 --> 03:37:44.536]  That is a clip from my latest video, The Truth About The Euro Elections.
[03:37:44.536 --> 03:37:48.239]  Get it out, share it on Facebook, because I can't, I'm banned.
[03:37:48.239 --> 03:37:51.922]  Mark Zuckerberg's cult doesn't want you to think a certain way, so you can't.
[03:37:51.922 --> 03:37:53.583]  I can't post it, at least you can post it.
[03:37:55.071 --> 03:38:01.595]  But again, we have the normalisation of political violence, now with the UK two days away from a European election.
[03:38:01.595 --> 03:38:04.136]  And we have this headline up on summit.news.
[03:38:04.136 --> 03:38:09.879]  Left-wing beer company tells customers to hit people over the head with bricks.
[03:38:09.879 --> 03:38:11.100]  Now I made the point before.
[03:38:11.835 --> 03:38:21.062]  Large corporations can get away with these edgy social justice tweets because they're big enough to take the hit from any potential boycott.
[03:38:21.062 --> 03:38:25.666]  Which is why with Nike, when they had the Colin Kaepernick campaign, they made money out of it.
[03:38:25.666 --> 03:38:29.889]  Gillette, when they had the anti-masculine campaign, lost a bit of money.
[03:38:29.889 --> 03:38:34.293]  But again, it's not going to move the dial that much either way because they're huge corporations.
[03:38:34.293 --> 03:38:39.217]  And they get free advertising from the avalanche of news coverage from the virtue signal.
[03:38:39.986 --> 03:38:44.008]  But then you get small businesses going online.
[03:38:44.008 --> 03:38:48.810]  This is a business basically owned by an Antifa supporter.
[03:38:48.810 --> 03:38:50.911]  The address of his business is online.
[03:38:50.911 --> 03:38:52.332]  Anyone can find it.
[03:38:52.332 --> 03:38:56.774]  And he tweeted, this is Chorlton Brewing Company in Manchester, UK.
[03:38:56.774 --> 03:39:02.356]  He tweeted, quote, Note to our customers, please don't throw our beer over fascists.
[03:39:02.356 --> 03:39:05.818]  Hit them over the head with a brick, as is traditional.
[03:39:06.994 --> 03:39:08.775]  Literally, that's what they tweeted.
[03:39:08.775 --> 03:39:13.078]  The tweet's been deleted, but we saved a screenshot of it.
[03:39:13.078 --> 03:39:32.892]  Then the owner, Mike Marcus, who literally has a black flag and an EU flag in his profile and calls himself an SJW and an anti-fascist, started insulting everybody who disagreed with this and said, actually, no, it's not acceptable to hit people over the head with bricks because they have a different opinion to you.
[03:39:32.892 --> 03:39:34.854]  Then to add even more irony to this,
[03:39:35.962 --> 03:39:41.227]  This company posted an email and said, we just received what seems to be a threat.
[03:39:41.227 --> 03:39:45.691]  The email was titled, you people are asking for trouble.
[03:39:45.691 --> 03:39:55.080]  So they literally endorse hitting people over the head with bricks, physically, and then they whine about an email, which wasn't even a threat.
[03:39:55.080 --> 03:39:57.202]  This is absolutely insane.
[03:39:57.202 --> 03:40:01.026]  This small business has just completely ruined their own reputation.
[03:40:01.758 --> 03:40:04.539]  There are outrage mobs on both the left and the right.
[03:40:04.539 --> 03:40:09.962]  Obviously the ones on the left are far more organized, far more vehement, far more vicious.
[03:40:09.962 --> 03:40:15.144]  We just saw last week BuzzFeed smearing a 14-year-old girl.
[03:40:15.144 --> 03:40:20.347]  But then you go on the Google reviews for this company that put out this tweet endorsing violence.
[03:40:20.347 --> 03:40:25.209]  Over the past five hours, their Google review rating has plummeted to 1.6 stars.
[03:40:28.624 --> 03:40:32.547]  I mean, let's read some of these reviews, solely as a result of this tweet.
[03:40:32.547 --> 03:40:34.889]  They've completely ruined their reputation.
[03:40:34.889 --> 03:40:36.830]  Was it worth it?
[03:40:36.830 --> 03:40:45.056]  One of these Google reviews says, In response to this beer company, I'd rather drink my own breast milk mixed with bricks.
[03:40:45.056 --> 03:40:50.440]  Luckily, the owner happily offered to throw a brick at me for me to use.
[03:40:50.440 --> 03:40:53.262]  Another one says, most disgusting product I've ever tasted.
[03:40:54.358 --> 03:40:59.260]  Another one says, piss-poor beer made me violently ill after I drank it.
[03:40:59.260 --> 03:41:02.982]  Another one says, awful beer served in an off-putting atmosphere.
[03:41:02.982 --> 03:41:06.223]  Obviously all these reviews are fake.
[03:41:06.223 --> 03:41:11.146]  None of these people have actually been to this business or tasted this beer.
[03:41:11.146 --> 03:41:18.469]  But they've left these reviews solely because of this absolutely incredibly dumb tweet endorsing political violence.
[03:41:20.476 --> 03:41:27.642]  Why would you even risk the very reputation of your business for one edgy tweet?
[03:41:27.642 --> 03:41:33.167]  Now, I went through the history of this company on Twitter.
[03:41:33.167 --> 03:41:37.110]  It's Antifa far-left fringe activism to a tee.
[03:41:37.110 --> 03:41:44.336]  In one of their tweets, they're whining about this beer company that has a sexy woman on the side of the truck for an ad.
[03:41:44.336 --> 03:41:45.797]  God forbid!
[03:41:45.797 --> 03:41:49.200]  And then in another tweet, the owner, who
[03:41:50.117 --> 03:41:57.379]  is listed in this article, literally is complaining about the taste of soy milk.
[03:41:57.379 --> 03:42:07.362]  I'm not joking, he literally takes pictures of himself with soy milk and apps the company on Twitter to complain about the taste, that it tastes too much like vanilla.
[03:42:07.362 --> 03:42:11.004]  And this is another video that I'm going to do, probably tomorrow.
[03:42:11.004 --> 03:42:14.085]  It's such a stereotype, but it's so true!
[03:42:14.085 --> 03:42:18.386]  All these people behave the same, they look the same, they are the quintessential
[03:42:19.290 --> 03:42:21.371]  Soy NPC.
[03:42:21.371 --> 03:42:24.392]  You saw the guy who attacked Farage with the milkshake.
[03:42:24.392 --> 03:42:28.833]  You saw the woman who advocated acid attacking Farage.
[03:42:28.833 --> 03:42:33.654]  I've seen the people who work for this company via their own tweets, and they all look the same.
[03:42:33.654 --> 03:42:39.996]  It's all this effet, ginger, skinny guy with glasses doing the soy face.
[03:42:40.993 --> 03:42:42.053]  They all look the same.
[03:42:42.053 --> 03:42:43.174]  They all behave the same.
[03:42:43.174 --> 03:42:46.035]  They all have the same dumb extremist opinions.
[03:42:46.035 --> 03:42:51.297]  And this idiot has ruined the reputation of his own company for one edgy tweet.
[03:42:51.297 --> 03:42:51.937]  Absurd.
[03:42:51.937 --> 03:42:52.497]  We'll be back.
[03:42:52.497 --> 03:42:54.098]  Don't go away.
[03:42:54.098 --> 03:43:01.500]  What you have witnessed is the biggest development in free speech in the Western world's history.
[03:43:01.500 --> 03:43:05.782]  This is a digital AI-enforced gag order.
[03:43:05.782 --> 03:43:09.483]  Not to say the name Alex Jones or InfoWars.com.
[03:43:15.151 --> 03:43:16.852]  This is Nazi Germany level.
[03:43:16.852 --> 03:43:18.072]  This is racketeering.
[03:43:18.072 --> 03:43:19.192]  This is cartels.
[03:43:19.192 --> 03:43:21.593]  Mr. President, we need your help.
[03:43:21.593 --> 03:43:23.474]  We need it now.
[03:43:23.474 --> 03:43:25.175]  You can take on Big Tech.
[03:43:25.175 --> 03:43:34.118]  They saw Infowars as a dominant, independent, anti-war, pro-human, pro-sovereign, pro-family, populist organization.
[03:43:34.118 --> 03:43:42.161]  So they thought, first they come for Alex Jones, then when people say, okay, take him off the air, everyone else like dominoes would fall.
[03:43:42.161 --> 03:43:43.021]  The way to fight back
[03:43:43.661 --> 03:43:48.506]  ...is to support Infowars now more than ever and make it a standard of freedom and free speech.
[03:43:48.506 --> 03:43:52.271]  Understand that if they believe they can take us down, they'll take everybody else down.
[03:43:53.263 --> 03:44:05.052]  It would take me more than an hour just to lay out all the admitted benefits and known positive effects of just one of the ingredients in our ultimate bone broth formula.
[03:44:05.052 --> 03:44:13.398]  Everybody knows about bone broth itself and all of the amazing things that it's associated with, and that it's been the big craze for at least a decade.
[03:44:13.398 --> 03:44:17.541]  Well, thousands of years ago, it's what everybody told people they should drink in a soup if they were sick.
[03:44:18.402 --> 03:44:25.125]  But then you add not just the fact that this is the strongest, most concentrated, highest quality bone broth out there, literally.
[03:44:25.125 --> 03:44:35.809]  Then you have the chaga mushroom, then you have the turmeric, then you have the bee pollen, then you have the other key ingredients that are all known to just make people incredibly strong and healthy.
[03:44:36.349 --> 03:44:38.571]  Our ultimate bone broth formula is amazing.
[03:44:38.571 --> 03:44:43.434]  It's 50% off right now at FullMorseStore.com because I want you to try it and see how great it is.
[03:44:43.434 --> 03:44:46.316]  And of course, getting the bone broth isn't just great for you and your family.
[03:44:46.316 --> 03:44:52.461]  It's also amazing when it comes to funding our operation that's taking on the globalists and fighting for all of our freedoms.
[03:44:54.338 --> 03:44:57.342]  Everybody knows that supplements are amazing.
[03:44:57.342 --> 03:44:59.945]  That what God gave us from mother nature is incredible.
[03:44:59.945 --> 03:45:02.729]  That's why supplements are the biggest growing industry in the world.
[03:45:02.729 --> 03:45:04.711]  And the globalists are so upset.
[03:45:04.711 --> 03:45:07.535]  The problem is people forget to take them.
[03:45:08.906 --> 03:45:09.286]  That's right.
[03:45:30.075 --> 03:45:30.755]  Okay, it's true.
[03:45:30.755 --> 03:45:32.116]  I stayed up late last night,
[03:46:52.779 --> 03:46:57.200]  And it's official.
[03:46:57.200 --> 03:47:06.223]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:06.223 --> 03:47:08.024]  News, analysis, reports.
[03:47:08.024 --> 03:47:09.364]  It's The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:09.364 --> 03:47:11.745]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:47:21.832 --> 03:47:26.494]  Now we have a situation, politically, where everything is tit for tat.
[03:47:26.494 --> 03:47:42.362]  We've seen the rise of left-wing outrage mobs, we've seen journalists abusing their platforms to get their competition de-platformed, and now you see more and more of that happening on the right, which is ultimately a shame for everyone, and a shame for free speech.
[03:47:42.362 --> 03:47:43.182]  As an addendum,
[03:47:43.900 --> 03:47:50.206]  To the story about the activist, left-wing activist, who advocated acid attacking Nigel Farage.
[03:47:50.206 --> 03:47:55.851]  She's now been fired by her employer, this charity called Happy City.
[03:47:55.851 --> 03:47:58.253]  So again, it's this tit-for-tat thing.
[03:47:58.253 --> 03:48:00.775]  Now we see a lot of this more so on the right.
[03:48:00.775 --> 03:48:06.020]  In fact, the Proud Boys group, who are completely de-platformed as a hate group, basically,
[03:48:06.710 --> 03:48:19.034]  They've now got an entire account on Telegram which is solely focused around getting left-wing people de-platformed, getting left-wing people in trouble with their employers for their comments on the internet.
[03:48:19.034 --> 03:48:22.355]  So it's come full circle and now you're seeing more of that on the right.
[03:48:22.355 --> 03:48:31.318]  I would never encourage contacting anyone's employers to try to get them fired for a political opinion no matter how offensive.
[03:48:31.318 --> 03:48:31.498]  But
[03:48:32.168 --> 03:48:39.732]  Look, if you're literally advocating acid attacks against politicians, that's a different kettle of fish because that is criminal!
[03:48:39.732 --> 03:48:42.213]  So she couldn't expect anything less than to be fired.
[03:48:42.213 --> 03:48:52.018]  There's another update on the story about the beer company who are advocating hitting people in the head with bricks and then whined when they got a mean email.
[03:48:52.018 --> 03:48:53.678]  Boo-hoo!
[03:48:53.678 --> 03:48:56.840]  So somebody responded to the article I wrote about it.
[03:48:56.840 --> 03:48:59.001]  The company's called Fuggles Beer Cafe.
[03:49:00.071 --> 03:49:05.054]  And they're saying we're not partners, just a bar that sells beer and does events with people who make it.
[03:49:05.054 --> 03:49:13.758]  However, we've decided we'll be pulling this event and won't be hosting Chorlton, which is the company that made the brick threat, on Thursday.
[03:49:13.758 --> 03:49:16.259]  We don't endorse violence in any way, shape or form.
[03:49:16.259 --> 03:49:28.205]  So now this company that received the backlash for openly endorsing violence against people by hitting them with bricks, now their events are getting pulled by partners that they were previously involved in.
[03:49:29.346 --> 03:49:33.328]  And their Google reviews have just completely cratered.
[03:49:33.328 --> 03:49:43.093]  They've ruined their business reputation over a single tweet, which would have got no attention anyway had it not been picked up by some people on the right.
[03:49:43.093 --> 03:49:46.454]  Absolutely incredible level of stupidity.
[03:49:46.454 --> 03:49:52.317]  But we're going to see more and more of this as this hysteria escalates, as it becomes a tit-for-tat war.
[03:49:53.146 --> 03:49:53.446]  It's absolutely
[03:50:10.763 --> 03:50:29.860]  Chilling that you've now got major national British newspapers openly endorsing political violence because that can only escalate, that can only get worse, it can only lead to the kind of insane incendiary rhetoric, which is criminal, openly inciting acid attacks against major politicians.
[03:50:29.860 --> 03:50:35.685]  And again, you'll get the argument, oh but there was a left-wing politician called Joe Cox who was murdered
[03:50:36.784 --> 03:50:39.485]  By a right-wing extremist in 2016.
[03:50:39.485 --> 03:50:40.906]  Yeah, that was terrible.
[03:50:40.906 --> 03:50:42.847]  Two wrongs don't make a right.
[03:50:42.847 --> 03:50:44.848]  All political violence is bad.
[03:50:44.848 --> 03:50:46.669]  So stop endorsing it!
[03:50:46.669 --> 03:50:51.651]  You don't have the moral high ground when you endorse violence against anyone.
[03:50:51.651 --> 03:50:53.271]  Absolutely incredible situation.
[03:50:53.271 --> 03:51:01.055]  We're going to get back into some news here in a minute, but I just want to mention the amazing new special available at infowarsstore.com.
[03:51:01.055 --> 03:51:03.076]  As you know, we need your support now more than ever.
[03:51:04.139 --> 03:51:09.742]  With all this deplatforming that's been taking place over the past year or so.
[03:51:09.742 --> 03:51:12.863]  We have the Memorial Day Mega Sale.
[03:51:12.863 --> 03:51:16.385]  There's never been a more crucial time to take a stand in the fight for our Republic.
[03:51:16.385 --> 03:51:23.268]  Globalist censorship and attacks are at all-time highs in an effort to shut down independent liberty media.
[03:51:23.268 --> 03:51:25.069]  The entire system is rigged against us.
[03:51:25.069 --> 03:51:28.370]  I'm going to get back into that in terms of YouTube in a second.
[03:51:28.370 --> 03:51:33.693]  George Soros just laid down, what was it, 250 million dollars in debt to say Vice Media
[03:51:34.949 --> 03:51:36.950]  We don't get big fat checks from George Soros.
[03:51:36.950 --> 03:51:41.171]  We're totally wholly dependent on you buying the products.
[03:51:41.171 --> 03:51:50.995]  So in honor of Memorial Day, we're launching game-changing specials and unveiling a brand new system for total health and performance that has been in design for over a year.
[03:51:50.995 --> 03:52:00.599]  This is called the 8-Pack Power Stack, which combines all the most powerful health supplements from your routine into two easy-to-use packets.
[03:52:00.599 --> 03:52:03.480]  The crew at InfoWars has dubbed it the Swiss Army Knife.
[03:52:04.145 --> 03:52:06.726]  of InfoWars Life and Nutraceuticals.
[03:52:06.726 --> 03:52:15.389]  So for a limited time we're launching the 8-pack PowerStack at 50% off straight out of the gates at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:52:15.389 --> 03:52:24.431]  We've also unveiled several more specials including ExtenderWise and MycoZX Plus at a massive discount of 60% off.
[03:52:24.431 --> 03:52:32.434]  We also have 50% off on the 8-pack PowerStack Bodies, Vitamin Mineral Fusion, The Ultimate Bone Broth and Super Male Vitality.
[03:52:33.251 --> 03:52:34.692]  As well as other great specials.
[03:52:34.692 --> 03:52:37.434]  So, again, we don't get big fat checks from George Soros.
[03:52:37.434 --> 03:52:39.496]  We get attacked on a daily basis.
[03:52:39.496 --> 03:52:40.397]  We get dragged down.
[03:52:40.397 --> 03:52:45.821]  But we're still here solely thanks to you getting the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:52:45.821 --> 03:52:51.625]  So please take advantage of those specials today.
[03:52:51.625 --> 03:52:52.966]  Headline on Summit.News.
[03:52:52.966 --> 03:52:57.109]  YouTube's trending tab is rigged in favor of big media.
[03:52:57.109 --> 03:52:59.271]  Again, confirming something that we already knew.
[03:53:00.245 --> 03:53:22.789]  The graphs show that back in, it was about the middle of 2017, CNN, CNBC, CBS News, all these channels on YouTube that were basically flatlining in terms of subscribers and views suddenly shot right up because the system was rigged in their favour and now we have more evidence of that because a study by a student at the University of Glasgow
[03:53:23.945 --> 03:53:28.708]  proves that YouTube's trending tab is heavily rigged in favor of big corporate media networks.
[03:53:28.708 --> 03:53:34.551]  Because whenever you go on this trending tab, none of the videos on there are actually trending.
[03:53:34.551 --> 03:53:35.812]  They've got no views.
[03:53:35.812 --> 03:53:38.774]  This is a curated, rigged list.
[03:53:38.774 --> 03:53:51.982]  This is not an organic list of trending videos, and they've rigged it in favor of big corporations because independent news creators were kicking their butts on YouTube for several years before.
[03:53:52.722 --> 03:54:00.544]  So they took 40,000 data entries in a bid to answer the question, is YouTube biased towards traditional media?
[03:54:00.544 --> 03:54:03.245]  And the answer was undoubtedly yes.
[03:54:03.245 --> 03:54:04.165]  They gave examples.
[03:54:04.165 --> 03:54:21.970]  For example, Philip DeFranco, who is basically a liberal centrist at this point, he puts out a daily news show, gets an average of 1.4 million views per video, yet he's only trended during this period where they studied it twice on the trending tab of YouTube.
[03:54:22.699 --> 03:54:28.542]  Compare that to the Associated Press, which only gets an average of 10,000 views per video.
[03:54:28.542 --> 03:54:36.927]  They've trended seven times, so more than three times as much, because it's rigged in favour of the mainstream media.
[03:54:36.927 --> 03:54:39.629]  And then you can look at other examples.
[03:54:40.882 --> 03:54:42.323]  Including people like PewDiePie.
[03:54:42.323 --> 03:54:46.525]  Of course, PewDiePie has the biggest channel in the West at this point.
[03:54:46.525 --> 03:54:49.006]  He was beaten by T-Series eventually.
[03:54:49.006 --> 03:54:54.349]  But in the United States of America, PewDiePie has the most subscribed to channel on YouTube.
[03:54:54.349 --> 03:54:59.692]  He appeared on the trending list in Canada 45 times!
[03:54:59.692 --> 03:55:04.535]  Yet only appeared on the trending tab in the United States once.
[03:55:04.535 --> 03:55:05.295]  Again, proving.
[03:55:06.164 --> 03:55:25.716]  That the list is curated, manipulated, rigged, in the favour of the usual suspects, Jimmy Kimmel and Stephen Colbert, who of course claim that they're comedians, but almost every other bit, almost every other routine, is pushing left-wing political narratives.
[03:55:25.716 --> 03:55:34.581]  They appeared on the trending tab dozens and dozens of times, compared to PewDiePie, who only appeared once in the United States.
[03:55:35.365 --> 03:55:44.459]  You have Joe Rogan, of course, massive viral success, gets millions of views on every single interview, every single podcast.
[03:55:44.459 --> 03:55:49.708]  I think the Alex Jones one was up to about 12 million the last time I checked.
[03:55:49.708 --> 03:55:50.389]  Joe Rogan,
[03:55:52.054 --> 03:56:06.400]  During this period when they conducted this study did not trend once on YouTube in the United States despite trending 74 times in Canada and dozens of times in all these different countries.
[03:56:06.400 --> 03:56:18.145]  So this is completely rigged in favor of the corporate media and we've discussed this before in terms of YouTube search engine which is basically now similar to Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook
[03:56:18.937 --> 03:56:28.800]  A cult of opinion, whereby if you search Alex Jones, the first 50 results or more are just mainstream media hit pieces against him, smearing him.
[03:56:28.800 --> 03:56:43.284]  Mark Dice did a video which we highlighted, whereby he could put in the exact headline of the exact title of a YouTube video, for example one about Michelle Obama, and before his video was returned in the search results,
[03:56:44.073 --> 03:56:51.458]  It was blocked off by a wall of mainstream media search results, some of which were not even related to Michelle Obama.
[03:56:51.458 --> 03:56:58.502]  And this is a guy in Mark Dice who has, what, 1.5 million subscribers, gets hundreds of thousands of views on every video.
[03:56:58.502 --> 03:57:08.108]  So they've broken their own search engine just to bury independent commentators and independent news producers like Philip DeFranco.
[03:57:09.295 --> 03:57:14.411]  So they've taken the U out of YouTube and now it is Corporate Tube.
[03:57:14.955 --> 03:57:21.078]  They've demonetized Sargon of Akkad, they've demonetized other channels, and their intentions are clear.
[03:57:21.078 --> 03:57:34.845]  While we still exist on that platform for now, as does Milo, Laura Loomer, and others, I think the fix is most certainly in, in terms of the way it's heading with YouTube censorship completely rigged in favor of the corporate media.
[03:57:34.845 --> 03:57:36.886]  And that story is up on summit.news.
[03:57:36.886 --> 03:57:39.308]  Coming up next is War Room with Owen Schroeder.
[03:57:39.308 --> 03:57:39.888]  Don't go away.
[03:57:39.888 --> 03:57:41.509]  Breaking news at infowars.com.
[03:57:49.040 --> 03:57:53.423]  Tom in Texas, police officer on the border, talks about MS-13 and more.
[03:57:53.423 --> 03:57:54.423]  Thanks for calling, Tom.
