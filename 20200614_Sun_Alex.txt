[00:00.000 --> 00:18.420]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well
[00:18.420 --> 00:27.420]  so does he live from the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones thank you for
[00:27.420 --> 00:31.400]  joining us on this live Sunday transmission I am Alex Jones own
[00:31.400 --> 00:36.640]  shroyer is going to be hosting the main body of the broadcast today America has
[00:36.640 --> 00:43.200]  been put into an artificial civil war globalist academics and CIA
[00:43.200 --> 00:48.280]  anthropologists and sociologists have measured and traced different fault lines
[00:48.280 --> 00:53.080]  in America they've had Hollywood and the university's prime everyone for racial
[00:53.080 --> 00:57.360]  division in the name of racial unity and they are attempting to bring us into
[00:57.360 --> 01:01.720]  a hot civil war they are attempting to completely destabilize the economy
[01:01.720 --> 01:07.080]  destroy confidence so that we will absolutely abandon the make America
[01:07.080 --> 01:13.720]  great again system and we'll go into total depression under the central banks
[01:13.720 --> 01:19.560]  we are going into absolute total bondage if you like what the Democrats have done
[01:19.560 --> 01:23.840]  in black areas of the country dumbing people down and slaving them getting them
[01:23.840 --> 01:26.640]  into debt putting them on welfare aborting them well you're really gonna
[01:26.640 --> 01:30.600]  love it because it's gonna happen to everybody this is a planetary complete
[01:30.600 --> 01:36.360]  and total takeover and you see this illustrated by the fact that all of the
[01:36.360 --> 01:42.120]  world governments are endorsing black lives matter as if there is again some
[01:42.120 --> 01:46.440]  attack on black people by the general public in the West when in truth it's
[01:46.440 --> 01:51.840]  the UN and the globalist that are absolutely targeting Africans particularly
[01:51.840 --> 01:55.960]  for depopulation and that's the state of our memorandum 200 with Henry Kissinger
[01:55.960 --> 02:00.400]  and has been part of US policy until now and Trump has pulled us out of UNESCO
[02:00.400 --> 02:04.040]  and pulled us out of these agreements that's actually been stopping this and
[02:04.040 --> 02:08.160]  that's why they're so angry at him again saying that he's the big evil horrible
[02:08.160 --> 02:13.960]  racist it is complete upside down world but the way to counter it the way to
[02:13.960 --> 02:19.160]  fight back against it is we the people COVID-19 is a giant hoax now they're
[02:19.160 --> 02:23.280]  saying we have to shut the country down again they were always going to do that
[02:23.280 --> 02:28.440]  that is why we have to call out black lives matter as a total and complete
[02:28.440 --> 02:32.760]  hoax to cover up the real extermination of the population in general and that's
[02:32.760 --> 02:36.960]  why we have to expose COVID-19 as the giant hoax that was 20 plus times
[02:36.960 --> 02:42.000]  smaller than what the Bill Gates model said it would and that's even using all
[02:42.000 --> 02:47.280]  the other deaths from gunshot wounds car wrecks the flu pneumonia that they've
[02:47.280 --> 02:53.520]  put in the COVID-19 column every person you see wearing the clown mask you've
[02:53.520 --> 02:57.520]  got to talk to them and tell them it's a fraud I've been doing it myself and
[02:57.520 --> 03:00.760]  almost everyone says look I know it's a fraud I'm ordered to wear this here at
[03:00.760 --> 03:04.760]  work or people say hey I just do this because of peer pressure so now we have
[03:04.760 --> 03:08.000]  to move to have governors but the president and others use their bully
[03:08.000 --> 03:12.960]  pulpits and their leadership to expose COVID-19 as an economy killing complete
[03:12.960 --> 03:17.080]  fraud and now the reports are out the third world is collapsing as predicted
[03:17.080 --> 03:20.480]  and mass migrant waves are coming this way because when the first world
[03:20.480 --> 03:24.880]  collapses the third world dies oh insurers taking over we have some
[03:24.880 --> 03:28.800]  powerful information that Lewis Farrakhan put out on vaccines and how
[03:28.800 --> 03:32.240]  they're tainted by design that's coming up and so much more today we have
[03:32.240 --> 03:38.800]  reporters on their way to the autonomous new world order communist zone in

[07:25.320 --> 07:30.160]  the war room crew the info wars crew decided we're gonna go out to Chas and
[07:30.160 --> 07:34.200]  we're just gonna go see what's up we're gonna go see what it's all about so Sam
[07:34.200 --> 07:39.880]  and Robert out there we've got Sam with us now so you've survived a weekend in
[07:39.880 --> 07:47.760]  Chas tell us what is the life like in the autonomous zone well behind enemy
[07:47.760 --> 07:52.160]  lines here coming at you and it's amazing man actually it feels more like a
[07:52.160 --> 07:56.520]  festival and a farmers market than anything else today but it's been pretty
[07:56.520 --> 08:01.400]  crazy honestly we started a Twitter that's already been banned because I guess
[08:01.400 --> 08:05.240]  we tweeted out something a little controversial but we're as you can see
[08:05.240 --> 08:10.440]  standing right in front of the police precinct here and it's just a very
[08:10.440 --> 08:14.880]  interesting site yeah it's all what what's going on there at the police
[08:14.880 --> 08:22.880]  police headquarters in Seattle well it's been I guess got fenced up and under
[08:22.880 --> 08:28.000]  guard I guess from keeping from people going in and it looks like most of the
[08:28.000 --> 08:31.560]  protesters who are around here for days have been saying they want it to be a
[08:31.560 --> 08:37.360]  community center so that might be going on other than that it's just pretty much
[08:37.360 --> 08:47.840]  like a lot of concert a lot of music a lot of people just thinking that you're
[08:47.840 --> 08:54.680]  telling me you got live music in Chas yeah oh and good news Owen there's a
[08:54.680 --> 08:58.160]  coronavirus going around doesn't chat doesn't the nation of Chas realize
[08:58.160 --> 09:02.520]  there's a COVID outbreak oh it doesn't matter there's a wizard there's a wizard
[09:02.520 --> 09:08.400]  of Chas and I found him the Wizard of Chas cures them of the corona ills yeah
[09:08.400 --> 09:12.480]  exactly no but it's it's definitely very interesting to see this police
[09:12.480 --> 09:15.480]  precinct boarded up and it doesn't look like the cops or anybody are coming
[09:15.480 --> 09:19.840]  anytime soon but everything seems pretty nonviolent and we've actually had some
[09:19.840 --> 09:23.520]  pretty good discussions out here so if anything I can see that as a real silver
[09:23.520 --> 09:28.880]  lining right now I don't know maybe that's just a little bit let me let me
[09:28.880 --> 09:31.920]  ask you this because there's still a bunch of protests happening and there
[09:31.920 --> 09:34.520]  has been some violence still over the weekend and there was just another
[09:34.520 --> 09:37.800]  shooting of a black man by police that they're gonna make a big deal of this
[09:37.800 --> 09:43.000]  week so so you're saying it's kind of like a music festival though so how much
[09:43.000 --> 09:48.040]  has it become like a political movement or statement into like I mean when I
[09:48.040 --> 09:51.080]  think music festival I think you know a bunch of people going around doing drugs
[09:51.080 --> 09:55.560]  getting drunk passing out waking up dancing listening to music not really
[09:55.560 --> 10:00.440]  showering or eating much I mean is it kind of like that or what to be honest
[10:00.440 --> 10:04.400]  yeah maybe a little bit more than people think because there was even a
[10:04.400 --> 10:09.080]  protest earlier today his signs were basically this is not a party if you
[10:09.080 --> 10:13.680]  think it's a party get out and he was a you know marching in favor of Black
[10:13.680 --> 10:16.080]  Lives Matter and stuff but he was basically saying that a lot of people
[10:16.080 --> 10:20.720]  are here just to drink and do drugs and you know play music but you know I've
[10:20.720 --> 10:24.200]  gotten different opinions on that because I even got to interview some of
[10:24.200 --> 10:28.080]  the musicians last night and they were kind of comparing it a little bit to
[10:28.080 --> 10:32.000]  Woodstock and being able to protest and play music at the same time I do
[10:32.000 --> 10:35.120]  understand that part but there might be a lot of people out here that think of
[10:35.120 --> 10:39.040]  this as an opportunity to get out of the house because of quarantine you know
[10:39.040 --> 10:41.840]  that's also definitely another reason that people are out here enjoying
[10:41.840 --> 10:45.640]  themselves even though most people are wearing masks we're definitely not seeing
[10:45.640 --> 10:52.520]  social distancing in any form so that's what about what about like there's
[10:52.520 --> 10:56.760]  businesses in that area too are they all boarded up are they shut down what if
[10:56.760 --> 11:01.880]  you have a business in that area are you out of business now well most of the
[11:01.880 --> 11:07.480]  businesses definitely are not working and some of them have just been you know
[11:07.480 --> 11:10.400]  transformed into like makeshift hospitals there's even a restaurant that
[11:10.400 --> 11:17.560]  got turned into like a little hospital and there's definitely enough so yeah I
[11:17.560 --> 11:23.200]  mean if your leg snaps in half they got you right yeah yeah exactly there's no
[11:23.200 --> 11:29.240]  police presence or ambulance or fire on the scene so good luck but it's it's
[11:29.240 --> 11:33.480]  hasn't been anything like maybe the pictures might have sounded or made it
[11:33.480 --> 11:36.360]  appear to be maybe like a week ago when there was tear gas and things like that
[11:36.360 --> 11:41.480]  I mean even you can't see behind me but there's actually shields that line the
[11:41.480 --> 11:44.760]  fence because in case the protesters needed to grab shields you could just
[11:44.760 --> 11:48.880]  grab them and protect yourself from rubber bullets or something like that
[11:48.880 --> 11:54.960]  but battle she has battles yeah exactly so the the lines have been drawn and
[11:54.960 --> 12:00.200]  we're inside chas right now so what kind of conversations have you been having
[12:00.200 --> 12:04.000]  though you say I mean is it like how political how conspiratorial do they
[12:04.000 --> 12:09.680]  hate Trump not I mean like where where does that go it can actually go in a
[12:09.680 --> 12:14.400]  lot of different directions the good news is we haven't had any sort of
[12:14.400 --> 12:18.800]  aggressive debating or anything like that but definitely a lot of people are
[12:18.800 --> 12:24.080]  saying that Trump hasn't done enough to respond to this he's definitely looking
[12:24.080 --> 12:29.560]  at this situation in a way that is not what's happening here on the ground so
[12:29.560 --> 12:33.520]  that may be you know true and hopefully we've got enough footage to be able to
[12:33.520 --> 12:39.080]  show that yeah so is that going to band on video well like I said we've been
[12:39.080 --> 12:43.560]  tweeting out a lot of our footage and we broke a rule or something so we got
[12:43.560 --> 12:49.360]  banned for 12 hours but we're basically at Chas daily so you can follow us there
[12:49.360 --> 12:54.160]  we probably should have put that on the screen but yeah we're at Chas daily yeah
[12:54.160 --> 12:59.280]  and basically we're just gonna be putting whatever we have in small videos
[12:59.280 --> 13:04.480]  but we'll be editing it as well later put it on band yeah so I mean when we're
[13:04.480 --> 13:08.720]  you know what's like the biggest pride blunt that you've seen out there I mean
[13:08.720 --> 13:14.160]  I'm sure there's just people walk around just getting totally high right oh yeah
[13:14.160 --> 13:18.520]  basically you could also say it's a bit of like a Marley Fest going on I mean it
[13:18.520 --> 13:24.800]  is Seattle Washington did you just bust out into an exercise are you watching me
[13:24.800 --> 13:31.800]  yeah looks like they're on the move now yeah there's a there's a there's a gas
[13:31.800 --> 13:37.120]  leak oh whoa whoa we got something happening here yeah there's a gas leak
[13:37.120 --> 13:41.520]  and so we're kind of kept out of an alleyway right now me and Rob are on the
[13:41.520 --> 13:45.080]  move oh boy people were just doing people were just getting high off raw
[13:45.080 --> 13:51.800]  methane huh just just cracked right into a pipeline huh that's jazz man that's
[13:51.800 --> 13:58.840]  jazz man exactly so the lollipop guild is in full force out here so but what do
[13:58.840 --> 14:03.000]  you think I mean how long can this go on I mean do they really think they can do
[14:03.000 --> 14:09.680]  this forever or what oh my god I don't know about that actually I was asking
[14:09.680 --> 14:13.280]  some people how long they think this might happen even some locals they're
[14:13.280 --> 14:17.960]  really not sure and unfortunately I think it's because their demands are not
[14:17.960 --> 14:23.880]  really concrete enough for this to meet any kind of resolution other than they
[14:23.880 --> 14:28.240]  want to just keep partying yeah so let me ask you this because we got 90 seconds
[14:28.240 --> 14:30.920]  and we got to go to a video coming up here but I mean what do these people
[14:30.920 --> 14:34.600]  really want I mean what is what are these people really want what are they
[14:34.600 --> 14:43.000]  really in this for okay well bottom line I guess they're talking about police
[14:43.000 --> 14:49.160]  reform they're talking about a recognition that you know cops have
[14:49.160 --> 14:54.960]  systematically been racist towards black people and they probably also want to
[14:54.960 --> 14:59.840]  push push a socialist agenda everything out here is free all the
[14:59.840 --> 15:03.920]  foods free waters free things like that so they're promoting things like that
[15:03.920 --> 15:09.480]  bottom line it just seems to be along that kind of message that I think the
[15:09.480 --> 15:13.480]  media is responsible for indoctrinating people more than the reality being the
[15:13.480 --> 15:18.520]  cops are racist of course so there it's a it's just kind of a free for all dude
[15:18.520 --> 15:24.480]  to do people actually live down there or do they just kind of come and go no no
[15:24.480 --> 15:29.000]  no there's people who live down here this is a neighborhood area and got to
[15:29.000 --> 15:31.800]  talk to some locals they said there's usually a lot of artists a lot of poets
[15:31.800 --> 15:36.440]  and there's some restaurants and so you love it you're now a chaz is stand
[15:36.440 --> 15:43.760]  officially Chaz is standing in Chaz Estonian basically I'm gonna one nation
[15:43.760 --> 15:49.120]  one people of jazz yes one nation one people exactly so we're having a good
[15:49.120 --> 15:53.400]  time talking to people and all right we'll link back up with you we'll link
[15:53.400 --> 15:56.120]  back up with you later we'll get the latest update from the nation of Chaz
[15:56.120 --> 16:01.720]  folks it may last forever I was talking to my Patriots supplier great
[16:01.720 --> 16:05.880]  suppliers you can now say four weeks on average for storeable food it's the
[16:05.880 --> 16:10.920]  highest quality they've got it use this little rest we have caught in the
[16:10.920 --> 16:13.960]  current to come up to the service gets the mayor before you get sucked back
[16:13.960 --> 16:17.960]  down I personally am ordering more storeable food I have to now start
[16:17.960 --> 16:22.720]  going into defense posture 80% offense but I've always been 100% offense
[16:22.720 --> 16:26.080]  trying to fully you know stop the globalists and we've given them a good
[16:26.080 --> 16:30.880]  run and I think down the road they'll be defeated but we're gonna still go down
[16:30.880 --> 16:35.560]  the hard road now there were a lot worse roads we probably go down but we've
[16:35.560 --> 16:39.080]  mitigated some of this but it's still gonna be bad my view you need to get
[16:39.080 --> 16:42.360]  high quality for the food it's something you need we have high quality ready to

[19:57.680 --> 20:00.720]  lose our souls
[20:02.480 --> 20:07.880]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[20:09.920 --> 20:16.360]  look at these headlines Houston to be relocked Florida hits high for third
[20:16.360 --> 20:22.080]  straight day Sunbelt spike of coronavirus Hawaii grapples with great
[20:22.080 --> 20:27.760]  depression level unemployment COVID-19 civil unrest could trigger mass
[20:27.760 --> 20:32.800]  migration those are all drug report headlines the United Nations has
[20:32.800 --> 20:37.160]  engineered the COVID collapse it's caused a worldwide depression it is far
[20:37.160 --> 20:40.120]  worse the third world than it is in the first world but we're starting to see
[20:40.120 --> 20:44.720]  the effects here and the government stimulus money isn't going to rebuild
[20:44.720 --> 20:49.160]  the economy if the economy isn't completely turned back on quickly and
[20:49.160 --> 20:55.720]  the third world will accelerate into total bedlam and mass waves will then
[20:55.720 --> 21:01.360]  surge at Europe and the United States of tens of millions not just a million
[21:01.360 --> 21:06.360]  we've already seen now that is officially in United Nations reports I
[21:06.360 --> 21:11.760]  don't need to wait till the UN puts a report out I said this four months ago
[21:11.760 --> 21:18.000]  you could see how the dominoes fall and now the UN World Food Program head who a
[21:18.000 --> 21:22.080]  month ago said 35 million were already starving to death says a hundred plus
[21:22.080 --> 21:26.640]  million are on the verge of starving to death out of the billions of poor on this
[21:26.640 --> 21:31.800]  planet when the first world collapses the third world dies but notice right as
[21:31.800 --> 21:36.920]  opposition was beginning to really peak a month ago to COVID-19 it was coming out
[21:36.920 --> 21:40.840]  with doctors and nurses pointing out it was a hoax they were putting all the
[21:40.840 --> 21:45.200]  deaths from gunshot wounds car wrecks the flu in the same column they were
[21:45.200 --> 21:48.600]  killing people by intubating them because the hospital is one of the money
[21:48.600 --> 21:52.600]  they were lying on the charts and saying that people had COVID who didn't all of
[21:52.600 --> 21:58.520]  this was beginning to come out and so they used the George Floyd situation to
[21:58.520 --> 22:03.440]  distract from that and change the subject anytime the system wants to
[22:03.440 --> 22:07.840]  trigger racial unrest they're able to snap their fingers and have liberal
[22:07.840 --> 22:13.120]  mayors and liberal leftist governors in blue sectors endorse the rioting
[22:13.120 --> 22:18.840]  Antifa shows up triggers the burning then they can pull back and the media can
[22:18.840 --> 22:23.960]  aim the cameras at black people and say look it's a black uprising that's all
[22:23.960 --> 22:27.840]  George Soros and Alexander Soros are doing we got the documents two plus
[22:27.840 --> 22:35.080]  years ago they're on infowars.com and still the FBI has done nothing still the
[22:35.080 --> 22:38.680]  Justice Department has done nothing the article with the documents is titled
[22:38.680 --> 22:45.800]  Martial Law Planned in Maryland in 2015 by Obama they tried to trigger this back
[22:45.800 --> 22:50.720]  then but it didn't work and now they're doing it again and Hollywood and the
[22:50.720 --> 22:55.480]  whole corporate media is hyping up that police are inherently evil and the
[22:55.480 --> 22:59.840]  police are inherently bad because they want to overthrow local government and
[22:59.840 --> 23:05.040]  not replace the police with some type of wonderful communist utopia that doesn't
[23:05.040 --> 23:10.960]  exist but replace it with authoritarian fascist police the IMF and World Bank
[23:10.960 --> 23:15.200]  have done this all over the world they destabilize first generally across
[23:15.200 --> 23:19.840]  racial lines they bring down an economy and then they bring in permanent
[23:19.840 --> 23:25.800]  martial law so the new world order is making its move right now on America
[23:25.800 --> 23:30.360]  now I want to air a special report that I played several times during the week
[23:30.360 --> 23:34.000]  I don't normally air something repeatedly but this is so important I'm
[23:34.000 --> 23:37.320]  gonna air it again and then oh and shorter it's gonna take back over it's
[23:37.320 --> 23:41.600]  posted on band.video as the featured video it's also on infowars.com I've
[23:41.600 --> 23:45.560]  asked the crew to put it back on the front page it's black lives matter is a
[23:45.560 --> 23:51.080]  globalist Trojan horse it's only four minutes long and it has all the documents
[23:51.080 --> 23:56.240]  all the statistics all the facts to show that this is completely synthetic that
[23:56.240 --> 24:00.200]  they're making a mountain out of a molehill to distract from the leftist
[24:00.200 --> 24:04.320]  globalist agenda to not just suppress black people but to suppress and
[24:04.320 --> 24:10.280]  disenfranchise everyone for social control so here is this report and then
[24:10.280 --> 24:14.440]  Owen is gonna get into the fact that Trump was gonna have a rally in
[24:14.440 --> 24:21.200]  Oklahoma but Juneteenth a holiday barely even celebrated in Texas from when the
[24:21.200 --> 24:25.200]  slaves learned late that they were free great wonderful that Trump canceled that
[24:25.200 --> 24:29.280]  because they were saying it was racist that he picked that day because of that
[24:29.280 --> 24:32.880]  holiday that's only celebrated in a couple states and most people don't even
[24:32.880 --> 24:37.160]  know about it's crazy so now he's announced his convention speech date
[24:37.160 --> 24:41.240]  and they found some date where the Klan did something bad and they're connected
[24:41.240 --> 24:47.720]  to that I mean it is just totally insane how the Democrats are projecting onto
[24:47.720 --> 24:53.840]  everything secret codes and secret corruption and secret KKK crap when
[24:53.840 --> 24:58.000]  they're the party of the KKK they're the party of abortion they're the party of
[24:58.000 --> 25:01.520]  Planned Parenthood they're the party of evil so here is Greg Reese's report
[25:01.520 --> 25:06.000]  please share this with everyone you know and please tell people about the live
[25:06.000 --> 25:10.000]  broadcast because without you we're unable to reach new people and again
[25:10.000 --> 25:14.000]  you're not just vital you're absolutely critical and I thank you all tell folks
[25:14.000 --> 25:17.680]  about the local AM and FM stations are listening to and the TV station you're
[25:17.680 --> 25:22.240]  watching tell folks about band.video and newswords.com forward slash show thank
[25:22.240 --> 25:28.320]  you here is Greg Reese's report black lives matter is a lie there is no
[25:28.320 --> 25:35.640]  genocide of young innocent black men in 2019 there were only 10 cases in which
[25:35.640 --> 25:41.520]  unarmed African-Americans were fatally shot by the police in five out of 10
[25:41.520 --> 25:46.600]  cases an officer was attacked just before the shooting and in two of the
[25:46.600 --> 25:52.840]  remaining four the officer was criminally charged where is the injustice
[25:52.840 --> 26:00.360]  also in 2019 there were 25 unarmed white Americans who were fatally shot by the
[26:00.360 --> 26:06.720]  police according to FBI statistics even though African-Americans make up only
[26:06.720 --> 26:14.520]  13% of the population they commit over 50% of all murder in America blacks kill
[26:14.520 --> 26:20.960]  10 times the amount of whites as whites kill blacks and a police officer is 18
[26:20.960 --> 26:25.680]  and a half times more likely to be killed by a black male than an unarmed
[26:25.680 --> 26:31.360]  black male is to be killed by a police officer black lives matter has been a
[26:31.360 --> 26:37.880]  lie since its very beginning in 2013 the movement began on social media after
[26:37.880 --> 26:42.800]  the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin but
[26:42.800 --> 26:48.200]  the case against Zimmerman was a lie the prosecution had used an imposter as a
[26:48.200 --> 26:53.080]  fake witness who they claimed wrote the only piece of criminal evidence they had
[26:53.080 --> 26:59.280]  a letter that the fake witness admitted under oath to not writing founded by
[26:59.280 --> 27:04.280]  known communists and fueled with millions of dollars from George Soros
[27:04.280 --> 27:10.560]  black lives matter organized riots in Ferguson Baltimore and Chicago and
[27:10.560 --> 27:15.960]  began recruiting an army of haters hiding beneath the guise of social
[27:15.960 --> 27:23.040]  justice the entire foundation of black lives matter is an obvious lie and yet
[27:23.040 --> 27:27.840]  the lie sells it sells because communities have been broken by
[27:27.840 --> 27:33.440]  government programs such as lbj's war on poverty that incentivized single
[27:33.440 --> 27:38.920]  motherhood and got young people hooked on welfare handouts it sells because
[27:38.920 --> 27:43.240]  people worship their favorite celebrities like false idols and believe the
[27:43.240 --> 27:49.000]  media is a source of undisputed truth it sells because people are afraid of
[27:49.000 --> 27:53.840]  being called a racist even when they know it's a lie and it sells because many
[27:53.840 --> 27:59.960]  prefer their own rage over seeking the truth following the COVID-19 shutdown
[27:59.960 --> 28:06.520]  perhaps the most traumatizing time for any American alive black lives matter
[28:06.520 --> 28:12.320]  joined forces with antifa and used a senseless murder as an excuse to wage
[28:12.320 --> 28:18.560]  war upon the American people dragging innocent people from their cars burning
[28:18.560 --> 28:25.200]  homes to the ground looting everything in sight and demanding that white people
[28:25.200 --> 28:31.320]  bow before them and kiss their feet they are subjugating white people creating
[28:31.320 --> 28:37.680]  them around in chains and demanding the dissolution of the police department what
[28:37.680 --> 28:43.360]  do you suppose is coming next black lives matter is a dangerous cancer that is
[28:43.360 --> 28:49.680]  poisoning our already damaged society the mainstream media our elected
[28:49.680 --> 28:55.680]  officials world leaders and practically every multinational corporation are all
[28:55.680 --> 29:01.960]  on board with BLM but the real problem I'm always excited about info wars life
[29:01.960 --> 29:04.980]  products they're amazing they're cutting edge you love them I love them and they
[29:04.980 --> 29:09.560]  find the info war in the face of the globalist onslaught but we have come up
[29:09.560 --> 29:15.720]  with a new product over a year in development that is amazing the only
[29:15.720 --> 29:22.040]  organic hand sanitizer on the market with organic essential oils on top of
[29:22.040 --> 29:28.320]  it and there's another innovation it's the spray cap it doesn't just pour out a
[29:28.320 --> 29:34.200]  bunch of thick gross goo goo but it's high quality and aerosolizes it in a
[29:34.200 --> 29:38.280]  really great way I like to put it on my hands rub a little my face it's got
[29:38.280 --> 29:42.000]  organic alcohol in it so spray it right in your eyes but I just love it
[29:42.000 --> 29:46.480]  personally has something that's a moisturizer as well so this is a real
[29:46.480 --> 29:49.080]  innovation I don't know why others didn't think of coming out with a hand
[29:49.080 --> 29:53.240]  sanitizer that actually has essential oil in it so it doesn't dry you out
[29:53.240 --> 30:01.600]  smells great it's so refreshing this is a big winner I've hunted a lot of big
[30:01.600 --> 30:07.160]  game at long distances with high caliber rifles and when you shoot an elk and say
[30:07.160 --> 30:13.520]  600 yards even if you hit them right in the heart they'll still run 50 60 70
[30:13.520 --> 30:19.040]  maybe a hundred yards they've got that adrenaline pumping through their arteries
[30:19.040 --> 30:22.360]  and through their veins but all of a sudden they slow down they realize
[30:22.360 --> 30:27.680]  what's happened they fall over and they die then you go bag them and haul them
[30:27.680 --> 30:32.800]  back in well that's what's gonna happen to the entire world now and that's what
[30:32.800 --> 30:38.640]  the economic numbers show is that we've been shot right in the heart and for the
[30:38.640 --> 30:42.680]  first world it's gonna mean a long horrible depression and a lot of death
[30:42.680 --> 30:46.000]  well for the third world it's gonna mean probably over a hundred million debt
[30:46.000 --> 30:50.040]  according to you and I believe their numbers because it's the very UN that's
[30:50.040 --> 30:54.000]  orchestrated this to depopulate the third world so that all the leftists that
[30:54.000 --> 30:57.000]  thought it was their revolution to get rid of Trump you're a bunch of suckers
[30:57.000 --> 31:02.440]  and you've bought into something bigger than what Hitler did as men age they
[31:02.440 --> 31:10.920]  often experience a slowdown in vitality energy and overall wellness and that's
[31:10.920 --> 31:17.440]  why we made one of our most popular formulas to date super male vitality

[35:33.920 --> 35:43.720]  we do here possible but it really is it's weird when everything info wars told
[35:43.720 --> 35:55.700]  you becomes true then what does info wars become? I mean you have an entire
[35:55.700 --> 35:59.120]  nation of people which is the minority which is the good news but I don't know
[35:59.120 --> 36:03.040]  how we defeat it because they're with Hollywood and all the media so they
[36:03.040 --> 36:07.640]  amplify and huff and puff themselves up to look like they're the loudest look
[36:07.640 --> 36:13.440]  like they're the biggest look like they're the majority. Do we have to have a
[36:13.440 --> 36:22.800]  political revolution that takes course over four, eight, sixteen years? Do we
[36:22.800 --> 36:27.720]  have that time? Is that possible?
[36:27.720 --> 36:34.280]  But when I see the lies that go down on mainstream news every day and come out
[36:34.280 --> 36:40.640]  of Hollywood every day and come out of Democrats lips every day we have statues
[36:40.640 --> 36:46.400]  being pulled down but Harvey Weinstein movies still air on TV, still on
[36:46.400 --> 36:54.600]  Netflix, still on all the video platforms, all the Hollywood pedophilia
[36:54.600 --> 37:05.600]  no no no no need to protest all that no need to march about that. Do baby lives
[37:05.600 --> 37:13.080]  matter? Well what if they're black? No no you see black lives only matter when the
[37:13.080 --> 37:18.160]  media and the Democrats can team up for an alley-oop on the American public to
[37:18.160 --> 37:27.800]  fundraise to the tunes of tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars and then
[37:27.800 --> 37:34.400]  if you really care about people and you want to try to warn people about this or
[37:34.400 --> 37:40.640]  try to give them the message of truth well you get called a racist and you
[37:40.640 --> 37:47.520]  get shut down. Oh don't worry about the Baphomet statues that have been
[37:47.520 --> 37:52.520]  government funded and erected in America and other countries nope those
[37:52.520 --> 37:58.920]  haven't been torn down. But where will the left stop? They'll never stop folks
[37:58.920 --> 38:06.280]  until America is dead and everything that ever represented America is gone as
[38:06.280 --> 38:19.160]  well. That's where we're at. So the Americans that are left and the
[38:19.160 --> 38:23.520]  Patriots that are left are gonna have to figure out what to do a lot of them are
[38:23.520 --> 38:28.720]  moving out of Democrat cities a lot of them think that just voting will solve
[38:28.720 --> 38:34.840]  the issue well I guess we'll find that out but meanwhile the left is
[38:34.840 --> 38:43.680]  continuing to gain yards against the American Republic and it makes me sick
[38:43.680 --> 38:50.880]  when you have Democrat politicians going on TV blaming police or white people
[38:50.880 --> 38:57.000]  for all the issues in this country which couldn't be a bigger lie if you said
[38:57.000 --> 39:02.240]  that the Sun rises in the West and sets in the East couldn't be a bigger lie
[39:02.240 --> 39:12.240]  told but they get away with it they get away with it every day and they're not
[39:12.240 --> 39:18.280]  gonna stop folks we've made it about halfway through 2020 we've made it
[39:18.280 --> 39:24.920]  about halfway through now we've had a fake pandemic we've had fake protests
[39:24.920 --> 39:34.520]  against fake issues what are they gonna fake next they faked Russian
[39:34.520 --> 39:40.280]  collusion they faked hate crimes with just a small let they faked it all and
[39:40.280 --> 39:47.720]  they're never gonna stop faking now I believe Hillary Clinton is gonna have
[39:47.720 --> 39:52.880]  to testify again in September but will she they may cancel that for COVID they
[39:52.880 --> 39:56.120]  may fake another pandemic or they may release a real bio weapon with Bill
[39:56.120 --> 40:00.600]  Gates certainly possible because Bill Gates now wants to vaccinate all of
[40:00.600 --> 40:09.040]  Africa and Lewis Farrakhan has come out and warned Africa about Bill Gates so
[40:09.040 --> 40:13.520]  Alex Jones is gonna be breaking that down coming up in the next segment and
[40:13.520 --> 40:23.480]  then I'm gonna take phone calls from 5 o'clock to 5 30 just your analysis
[40:23.480 --> 40:27.280]  because I got a bunch of news and a bunch of videos to play and and I'm gonna
[40:27.280 --> 40:31.160]  do most of that tomorrow when I host the war room and I believe Alex is back in
[40:31.160 --> 40:40.520]  studio tomorrow but I want to hear from you the audience and so I'll open up the
[40:40.520 --> 40:44.840]  phone lines now you're gonna have to wait about 20 minutes but if you would
[40:44.840 --> 40:48.360]  just wait because I want to be able to as soon as 5 o'clock hit start taking
[40:48.360 --> 40:52.360]  phone calls all the way through 5 30 and they're gonna be joined by the crew
[40:52.360 --> 40:59.960]  again from the nation of Chas where a street preacher was basically sexually
[40:59.960 --> 41:02.520]  assaulted we'll get to that in a second but but here's the number if you want to
[41:02.520 --> 41:05.360]  get in and I'm gonna start taking calls at 5 o'clock so that's gonna be in 20
[41:05.360 --> 41:16.000]  minutes 877-789-2539 877-789-2539 just what do you make of the madness does it
[41:16.000 --> 41:18.920]  get better from here does it get worse from here what are you thinking what are
[41:18.920 --> 41:25.200]  you believing what are you doing so from 5 central to 5 30 nothing but your
[41:25.200 --> 41:31.520]  phone calls here on the Alex Jones show but here is a street preacher go to clip
[41:31.520 --> 41:36.400]  4 here guys and you can roll clip 5 as well but here's a street preacher who
[41:36.400 --> 41:41.920]  goes into the Chas in Seattle and is immediately assaulted
[41:45.920 --> 41:50.200]  so you got them there they're all choking him
[41:50.720 --> 41:54.720]  street preacher you're not allowed to go in there because it because you know
[41:54.720 --> 41:58.680]  they're all about free speech and stopping oppression until you say
[41:58.680 --> 42:07.280]  something they disagree with and then they censor you and oppress you and by
[42:07.280 --> 42:16.360]  the way they also forced him to kiss a gay dude yeah they held him up and they
[42:16.360 --> 42:20.800]  forced him to kiss a gay guy right here street preacher goes in to preach the
[42:20.800 --> 42:26.360]  gospel and tell you about Jesus and he gets physically assaulted and sexually
[42:26.360 --> 42:35.160]  assaulted I mean this is this is sexual assaults I mean I'm sorry when you're
[42:35.160 --> 42:40.120]  like hey I'm gay kiss me to prove you're not a homophobe dude you just sexually
[42:40.120 --> 42:45.000]  assaulted me and he's holding him by the neck and then he kisses him and licks
[42:45.000 --> 42:50.280]  him multiple times I mean this is ridiculous but this is the left I mean
[42:50.280 --> 42:53.120]  this is what the left is building for themselves that's what they don't
[42:53.120 --> 42:56.800]  understand all the leftist leaders are in their high towers and mansions this is
[42:56.800 --> 43:03.040]  what they're building for you the leftists it's finally here introducing the

[44:10.600 --> 44:13.840]  current to come up to the surface get some air before you get sucked back down
[44:13.840 --> 44:18.040]  I personally am ordering more storeable food I have to now start going into
[44:18.040 --> 44:23.360]  defense posture 80% offense but I've always been 100% offense trying to
[44:23.360 --> 44:26.920]  fully you know stop the globalists and we've given them a good run and I think
[44:26.920 --> 44:30.880]  down the road they'll be defeated but we're gonna still go down the hard
[44:30.880 --> 44:35.240]  road now there were a lot worse roads you'd probably go down but we've
[44:35.240 --> 44:38.800]  mitigated some of this but it's still gonna be bad my view you need to get

[45:05.800 --> 45:12.440]  elaborate plans the end of everything that stands the end the safety the
[45:12.440 --> 45:16.960]  delusion it's all over ladies and gentlemen because there was only the
[45:16.960 --> 45:23.600]  mirage of safety movies and partying and living like children never growing up
[45:23.600 --> 45:28.560]  never caring about other people this delivered us into the hands of tyranny
[45:28.560 --> 45:33.160]  just like the history book show us just like the Bible states every time Israel
[45:33.160 --> 45:36.760]  became corrupt and evil and turned away from God they were brought into
[45:36.760 --> 45:42.400]  captivity because their people sold out to special interest and were infiltrated
[45:42.400 --> 45:47.160]  by spies and then they were enslaved we are repeating that again today
[45:47.160 --> 45:52.640]  compliance and going along with this system leads to absolute bondage
[45:52.640 --> 45:57.400]  info wars has decided to fight for freedom info wars had great victory
[45:57.400 --> 46:06.000]  thanks to your support to your prayers are champions made here's a man who
[46:06.000 --> 46:11.160]  can show you
[46:41.160 --> 46:50.160]  The best in four store.com beats out all the rest triple a two five three thirty one three nine triple a two five three one three nine triple a two five three three one three nine
[46:50.160 --> 46:59.160]  That's info store.com
[46:59.160 --> 47:11.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[47:17.160 --> 47:23.160]  Black Lives Matter is a complete and total synthetic manufactured fraud.
[47:23.160 --> 47:38.160]  Black Lives Matter entire purpose is to cover up the fact that Democratic Party is part of an international eugenics depopulation program that has a particular bent towards targeting black people period no matter where they are on the face of the earth.
[47:38.160 --> 47:50.160]  The globalist want black people dumb down disenfranchised and exterminated and that's a fact and that's a historical point that must be made.
[47:50.160 --> 48:02.160]  It's not about virtue signaling to black people that oh only 12 black men died of questionable police shootings in the last year.
[48:02.160 --> 48:13.160]  None of those shootings are okay. The point is, is those shootings are used as the distraction for the millions and millions and millions of babies that are aborted every year in this country.
[48:13.160 --> 48:22.160]  And the fact that the majority of black people never make it out of their womb, out of their mother's womb, and that that's the most dangerous place for a black person on earth.
[48:22.160 --> 48:32.160]  And the less argument is blacks are poor blacks are disenfranchised. Well by that argument then everybody who ever came from any poor roots should be killed. It's a total fraud.
[48:32.160 --> 48:39.160]  And the whole system is about keeping people in poverty so they can be controlled and experimented on.
[48:39.160 --> 48:44.160]  Now, if black folks are gonna listen to me, I know a lot of black folks do.
[48:44.160 --> 48:59.160]  How about you listen to Lewis Farrakhan, because everything Lewis Farrakhan says in this speech from over a decade ago, warning blacks in the Caribbean and blacks in Cuba and other areas about taking western vaccines,
[48:59.160 --> 49:19.160]  he's telling them historic facts. In fact, I'm gonna ask one of our great researchers, probably Rob Dew, he's one of the top guys in our office on vaccine research and all the files, video clips and information to take Farrakhan's speech and to add documents and video clips to it and air it later in the week.
[49:19.160 --> 49:26.160]  But here it is just a few minutes long. And if you drill down into everything, Minister Farrakhan says it's true.
[49:26.160 --> 49:33.160]  You get mad at Farrakhan for what he said about Israel. You can get mad at Farrakhan for, that's not the issue here.
[49:33.160 --> 49:38.160]  The point is, is that Lewis Farrakhan is telling you do not take the vaccines.
[49:38.160 --> 49:47.160]  It's not because the science of vaccines isn't real. Yes, you can learn immunity from them. That's why it points out that, you know, you can get vaccines he thinks that are trustworthy from Cuba.
[49:47.160 --> 50:01.160]  I haven't really seen the evidence of that, but I do know that it came out a decade ago that in Russia, in China and in Germany, the elites have quote, clean special vaccines made for them that are not contaminated because here's one more issue.
[50:01.160 --> 50:07.160]  Here's just a small example. Everybody knows about peanut allergies didn't exist 50 years ago. Now it kills thousands a year.
[50:07.160 --> 50:26.160]  Well, that's from older vaccines that they've now phased out in the 2000s that were grown on peanut protein. And then the body would become allergic to peanuts because it also was becoming basically allergic to the pathogen that was in the vaccine.
[50:26.160 --> 50:35.160]  So if a vaccine is contaminated with anything else, and there's an adjuvant to cause a bigger autoimmune response, your body will become allergic to whatever else is in there.
[50:35.160 --> 50:40.160]  And that's just one of the quote unintentional things that vaccines do.
[50:40.160 --> 50:46.160]  And so the vaccine pushers literally want the precedent to stick in our bodies what they want when they want now.
[50:46.160 --> 51:09.160]  Farrakhan is afrocentric or focused on blacks. And I get it. If people can't take care of themselves and have their own identity, they're going to be enslaved and Farrakhan's 100% right that blacks should have their own businesses, their own communities that is not segregation.
[51:09.160 --> 51:19.160]  Overall, Farrakhan puts out a message that the media cherry picks to try to discredit him with. But generally, I agree with about 95% of what Liz Farrakhan says.
[51:19.160 --> 51:29.160]  I don't agree on getting into all the juice stuff because that's just a rabbit trail that never ends. I don't agree, you know, that there's just inherently white people want to get black people.
[51:29.160 --> 51:43.160]  And again, Farrakhan's even told me in person that that's not what he thinks is going on, but that sometimes he puts out the red meat of, well, quite frankly, racial identity for black folks so that they will have confidence and have their identity and stand up for themselves.
[51:43.160 --> 51:50.160]  And you do that by taking care of your family. You do that by being strong. You do that by being loving. You do that by being self-sufficient and independent.
[51:50.160 --> 52:05.160]  And you do that by not letting people kill your children. So bottom line, Black Lives Matter is an evil, satanic distraction from the true evil that is the leftist movement that hides its eugenics and its extermination operation behind all its liberal propaganda
[52:05.160 --> 52:20.160]  to where there's all these riots and death and destruction over 12 black men who may have been wrongly killed. The average is about 14 years, 12 so far this year, and distracting from the real operation, the floor on the water, the tainted vaccines, the sterilization, the entire operation.
[52:20.160 --> 52:38.160]  So here he is, Lewis Farrakhan, and then we'll go back to the live show with Owen Schreuer as we start hour number two. And remember, you are the Paul Revere's out there. I don't care what color you are, you got red blood. And if you want to make it out of this new world order, do your research, keep your facts straight, and start warning other people because that is what could override the censors.
[52:38.160 --> 52:51.160]  Here he is, Minister Lewis Farrakhan.
[52:51.160 --> 53:20.160]  A policy to depopulate the third world. How does that affect Jamaica? How does that affect the Caribbean? Did you know that Henry Kissinger wrote the memo that became policy and they said they were going to use food as a weapon?
[53:20.160 --> 53:45.160]  And they sent that policy to the Department of Agriculture, to the Department of Defense, to the Department of CIA Intelligence, so they're all in the world of the third world, setting the third world up for internal strife and revolution and death.
[53:45.160 --> 54:04.160]  Where does your food come from? Why does Jamaica owe billions of dollars for the importation of food when you could grow it yourself?
[54:04.160 --> 54:19.160]  But they grow it a thousand miles away and they cannot pick it after it is ripe. They have to pick it before it's ripe.
[54:19.160 --> 54:39.160]  Then they ripen it with chemical processes, wax it, color it, and you eat in it because it looks good in the supermarket, and now you're dying of all these different cancers.
[54:39.160 --> 55:03.160]  Talk to me. They're killing us off. AIDS is a biological weapon. Ebola is a biological weapon.
[55:03.160 --> 55:14.160]  I read recently, I don't know the truth, but it has been patented.
[55:14.160 --> 55:43.160]  You can patent a virus, that means somebody made it, they take a natural thing, they have to depopulate the earth by two to three billion people, and you and I are in the crosshairs of the depopulation thrust of the policies of the American government.
[55:43.160 --> 55:58.160]  Where do your vaccines come from? If you're not getting them from Cuba, you need to look at them carefully.
[55:58.160 --> 56:13.160]  Please listen. You're vaccinating your children, but you don't know what's in the vial that they're putting in your children's arms. All of a sudden they're suffering from autism.
[56:13.160 --> 56:21.160]  Then they tell you, no, no, no, there's no connection between the vaccine and autism.
[56:21.160 --> 56:36.160]  Now tell that to somebody else. See, this is the enemy, the same enemy that put smallpox in blankets to the Native Americans to kill them off.
[56:36.160 --> 56:54.160]  The same enemy that was involved in the Tuskegee experiment to fill black men with syphilis and give them the freedom to cohabit with black women.
[56:54.160 --> 57:05.160]  And the video and audio that you just heard from Lewis Faircon is posted in full on infowars.com and newswars.com. We're about to start our number two with Owen Schreuer.
[57:05.160 --> 57:19.160]  I have several other reports I'm going to be filing as well. We also have crew that are making their way right now to the autonomous zone of CHAS, where the communists are, again, stealing the identity of black people to push their communist agenda
[57:19.160 --> 57:28.160]  and trying to fool black people into being figureheads and front people with their operations. Our number two is straight ahead newswars.com forward slash show.
[57:28.160 --> 57:39.160]  That's how you send people to the audio and video feeds. That link is not censored as much as infowars online, so newswars.com forward slash show and, of course, band.video.
[57:39.160 --> 57:49.160]  Our number two with Owen Schreuer from the ATX. I'm Alan Jones. Stay with us.
[57:49.160 --> 58:09.160]  The people of the world have awakened to globalism, and so populist movements are throwing the globalist out of their countries. That's why the New World Order is instituting race war and division and telling the people that rebellion is about overthrowing your local police and government and destroying essential services.
[58:09.160 --> 58:24.160]  This is an attempt to have society collapse, and the globalists, as they've done in the third world, will come in and pick up the pieces. They must stand against the UN, the IMF, the World Bank, and the EU openly saying they fund the police.
[58:24.160 --> 58:37.160]  The police have a lot of problems. We all have a lot of problems, but this is our government and our local vocabulary. And believe me, once the globalists have overthrown this country, they are going to put in a real police state where you have no due process or freedom.
[58:37.160 --> 58:47.160]  The globalists believe Communist China is the model of the world, and they are orchestrating this entire thing. The people helping them are collaborators and are idiots and must be opposed.
[58:47.160 --> 58:56.160]  infowars.com
[58:56.160 --> 59:09.160]  The globalists have gotten away with their Russiagate hoax, their Ukraine hoax, their COVID-19 hoax, and now it's the race riot hoax of 2020.
[59:09.160 --> 59:18.160]  We've got to ask ourselves what's coming next. Well, I can tell you, it's going to be a bunch of big old fat mass shootings to create even a bigger race war.
[59:18.160 --> 59:37.160]  It's going to be economic collapse, China invading Taiwan, Hong Kong, you name it. The globalists are attacking on every front. That's why now, more than ever, we have to realize they've tried to censor info wars off the air because they knew that when they launched this whole situation that they didn't want the people's voice to still be on air.
[59:37.160 --> 59:52.160]  But thanks to you and our crew, we are still on air. So let's boost that transmission like the Batman signal now more than ever. infowars.com lives.
[59:52.160 --> 1:00:08.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:08.160 --> 1:00:24.160]  And as promised, I'm going to go right to your phone calls for the next 30 minutes before we go back live to the nation of jazz.
[1:00:24.160 --> 1:00:39.160]  Let's go back to Seattle with Tim. First caller today from Seattle is Tim. Tim, go ahead. You're on the Alex Jones show. How's it going on? Antifa is incredibly, they're misguided and they're full of hate.
[1:00:39.160 --> 1:00:57.160]  I've been bullhorning them. I've got a pretty decked out bullhorn covered in info wars stuff. I've gone out with info wars gear and I've tried to explain it to them that they're misguided and they hate these facts. They can't stand it. There's no room for conversation with these kids.
[1:00:57.160 --> 1:00:58.160]  Nothing.
[1:00:58.160 --> 1:01:13.160]  Yeah, think about it like this. It's like, if you had a name that was like, it had, I don't know, it had some reference to like, let's say a watch like, I'm Dr. Watch and they said, Oh, what kind of watches you like? You're like, well, what's a watch? You're like, your doctor watch.
[1:01:13.160 --> 1:01:28.160]  It's like, okay, your Antifa. All right. Well, what's fascist? Who are the fascists? Well, I don't know about the fascism. I don't know who are the fascists. What? So it's just like, you're out here waving a flag, you know, nothing about. But I think you're right.
[1:01:28.160 --> 1:01:37.160]  It's about hate. It's about destroying things, about feeling part of something. And I think that's what draws them to that, not the understanding and dismantling of fascism.
[1:01:37.160 --> 1:01:49.160]  No, it's an entire culture of hate and death. I mean, if you look at their memes, if you look at what they wear, if you look at what they talk about, I walked through chess yesterday and I saw so many goats and mendes t shirts.
[1:01:49.160 --> 1:02:02.160]  There's so much Satanism. It's just, it's, it's, it's incredibly rampant. And I don't really think there's any solutions other than maybe a few of them, you know, realizing that it's, you know, that there's possibly another side of the narrative.
[1:02:02.160 --> 1:02:12.160]  But there's so much cult think consensus and threats of violence too. I mean, these kids are violent. So I think that they would turn on each other in a heartbeat just for, just for having dissent.
[1:02:12.160 --> 1:02:24.160]  So it's a really, it's a real terrible situation. I think Donald Trump, my election night prediction when he was elected was that and teeth would have to be FEMA camp in order to maintain order.
[1:02:24.160 --> 1:02:36.160]  Well, they closed the, they closed the mental institutions. So, and now they're dismantling police forces. So I don't know what else I guess you could just give them all these Democrat liberal stronghold cities for them to just burn to the ground.
[1:02:36.160 --> 1:02:45.160]  And then maybe they'll get it once it becomes a Lord of the fly situation. But again, they don't even go after fascists. I mean, they're not going after Google.
[1:02:45.160 --> 1:02:58.160]  They're not going after these, these companies that are buying up all the competition and then now funneling everything into their own pockets. They don't go after the actual fascists who are still operating during while everyone else is on COVID lockdown.
[1:02:58.160 --> 1:03:03.160]  Tim, thanks for the call. Let's go to Seth in Vancouver. Go ahead, Seth.
[1:03:03.160 --> 1:03:05.160]  Hey, Owen. Can you hear me okay?
[1:03:05.160 --> 1:03:07.160]  Yep.
[1:03:07.160 --> 1:03:22.160]  Hey, yeah. So I wanted to call into the show today because I kind of had about a week or so ago when I was watching the video you guys posted of the nurse and NYC.
[1:03:22.160 --> 1:03:30.160]  I'm exposing the killing of the COVID-19 patients.
[1:03:30.160 --> 1:03:33.160]  Right. Yeah, the undercover nurse.
[1:03:33.160 --> 1:03:46.160]  Yeah. So basically what you were saying in there and correct me if I'm wrong is that they were taking patients into the NYC hospital that were having respiratory issues, right?
[1:03:46.160 --> 1:03:52.160]  With their breathing. I couldn't breathe. But they're getting, they're testing negative for COVID.
[1:03:52.160 --> 1:03:57.160]  And then they were putting them into a wing of COVID patients.
[1:03:57.160 --> 1:04:09.160]  And they were suspected of having COVID-19, right? And even though they kept testing negative, testing negative, then they put them on the vent, which they essentially blew up their lungs.
[1:04:09.160 --> 1:04:15.160]  And then they put their bodies full of fentanyl, right?
[1:04:15.160 --> 1:04:20.160]  Which is just killing people. Like for one patient there, that was 37.
[1:04:20.160 --> 1:04:23.160]  And the epiphany I had.
[1:04:23.160 --> 1:04:24.160]  You got 30 seconds.
[1:04:24.160 --> 1:04:27.160]  Okay. Okay. Yeah, I'll try.
[1:04:27.160 --> 1:04:38.160]  So David Eich, second interview with Brian Rose, he goes over how 5G at 60 gigahertz disrupts the oxygen flow to your body.
[1:04:38.160 --> 1:04:44.160]  And then he also mentions in there, that's where the 5G towers are right now in NYC, right? By those hospitals.
[1:04:44.160 --> 1:04:50.160]  So my question is, what are they going to stay next when they roll out 5G on the full scale?
[1:04:50.160 --> 1:04:58.160]  And everyone starts getting these references. Let me just hold you over and I'll ask you, because I think I get what you're getting at, but I want to make sure.
[1:05:21.160 --> 1:05:25.160]  It's great at work, but this is great for the car. It's great to keep with you.
[1:05:25.160 --> 1:05:32.160]  And again, it's also good for the throat and mouth to get the effects of iodine, not to just ingest it into the stomach.
[1:05:32.160 --> 1:05:35.160]  We're really excited about it. It's 33% off out of the gates.
[1:05:35.160 --> 1:05:41.160]  It was listeners' idea asking for us to come up with a spray bottle that had us talk to the scientists and developers
[1:05:41.160 --> 1:05:47.160]  and come up with a system that aerosolizes it and delivers it to the body in a new and in some ways, even better way.
[1:05:47.160 --> 1:05:53.160]  Get your survival shield X2 nascent iodine spray now at 33% off at infowarstore.com
[1:05:53.160 --> 1:06:18.160]  and experience the power of aerosolized X2 nascent iodine for yourself.
[1:06:18.160 --> 1:06:29.160]  The coronavirus situation is very complex. It's hard to just narrow it down and everybody wants narrowed down simplified things, but some things just can't be simplified.
[1:06:29.160 --> 1:06:39.160]  And so I'm not sure what Seth was getting at, so I wanted him to finish his point, but if his point is there's a correlation between the 5G and the coronavirus,
[1:06:39.160 --> 1:06:49.160]  a lot of people have been speculating that since January or even before when the virus supposedly broke out in Wuhan, which was the same place they were testing the 5G.
[1:06:49.160 --> 1:06:58.160]  But what I think Seth was getting at was that the coronavirus was actually a cover up for the 5G that they released,
[1:06:58.160 --> 1:07:02.160]  but they didn't want you to think, oh, I'm getting blasted by the 5G that they're going to implement around the world.
[1:07:02.160 --> 1:07:08.160]  Instead, it's just a coronavirus. But Seth, finish up your point here from just a minute ago.
[1:07:08.160 --> 1:07:15.160]  Yeah, that's based on what I was trying to say, Owen, and I think you put it very coinantly.
[1:07:15.160 --> 1:07:21.160]  It's not fully rolled out yet, but if you look at where they're getting these massive,
[1:07:21.160 --> 1:07:26.160]  supposedly COVID-19 outbreak is where the 5G towers are right now.
[1:07:26.160 --> 1:07:29.160]  So what's going to happen when they roll all this out?
[1:07:29.160 --> 1:07:36.160]  Well, what I think is going to happen is they're going to say, oh, we got the second wave, it's here, right?
[1:07:36.160 --> 1:07:38.160]  You know, once they roll it out.
[1:07:38.160 --> 1:07:41.160]  Yeah, and then they can even make you take the vaccine.
[1:07:41.160 --> 1:07:44.160]  Yeah. Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.
[1:07:44.160 --> 1:07:48.160]  And right now, when they have everyone out in the streets riding and looting,
[1:07:48.160 --> 1:07:53.160]  they're trying to get all these regulations passed to implement the mandatory vaccine.
[1:07:53.160 --> 1:08:04.160]  For example, one just passed in Colorado, which basically makes it mandatory for all residents to take a COVID-19 vaccine once it's available.
[1:08:04.160 --> 1:08:08.160]  There is a way you can get exempt from it, but it's really tough.
[1:08:08.160 --> 1:08:11.160]  Yeah, I guess that is becoming the ultimate question here, Seth.
[1:08:11.160 --> 1:08:13.160]  Thank you for the call.
[1:08:13.160 --> 1:08:18.160]  Because folks, most people aren't really going to fight until they have to.
[1:08:18.160 --> 1:08:23.160]  And that would be either when they're starving or their children are being taken or something of that nature,
[1:08:23.160 --> 1:08:29.160]  or somebody comes to your door and demands your gun or forces you to take a vaccine.
[1:08:29.160 --> 1:08:38.160]  I mean, is that the point that we're going to get to? Is the left globalist, Democrat?
[1:08:38.160 --> 1:08:43.160]  Is that movement really going to come to your doorstep and make you take a vaccine and hand over your weapon?
[1:08:43.160 --> 1:08:48.160]  Are we going to get that far?
[1:08:48.160 --> 1:08:55.160]  I mean, I don't know how we've even gotten to this point, quite frankly,
[1:08:55.160 --> 1:08:59.160]  where they fake pandemics and such and you lose your business.
[1:08:59.160 --> 1:09:02.160]  And then it's just the propagandas everywhere.
[1:09:02.160 --> 1:09:04.160]  And I will say this because I wanted to just take your calls.
[1:09:04.160 --> 1:09:07.160]  I'm going to go back, but I came up in sports media.
[1:09:07.160 --> 1:09:09.160]  I've always been a sports fan.
[1:09:09.160 --> 1:09:17.160]  And I'm so disgusted by the propaganda that's just everywhere now on all the sports entertainment and everywhere.
[1:09:17.160 --> 1:09:21.160]  I don't even think I could even watch a sporting match anymore of anything.
[1:09:21.160 --> 1:09:26.160]  Same thing like, for example, Netflix pops up a thing like, we support Black Lives Matter.
[1:09:26.160 --> 1:09:30.160]  Here, watch the playlist for Black Lives, done, canceled.
[1:09:30.160 --> 1:09:36.160]  But it's just this, the left wing anti-American propaganda is everywhere.
[1:09:36.160 --> 1:09:41.160]  And Obama made it all legal in 2014 when he signed the NDAA.
[1:09:41.160 --> 1:09:53.160]  So yeah, you're getting just full onslaught of Chinese, leftist, globalist communist propaganda via the signature of Barack Obama.
[1:09:53.160 --> 1:09:59.160]  And see, this is why you have to get Obama and arrest him and put him in jail and then just nullify everything he ever did.
[1:09:59.160 --> 1:10:01.160]  But maybe that day will come.
[1:10:01.160 --> 1:10:04.160]  Let's go to James in Texas.
[1:10:04.160 --> 1:10:07.160]  Go ahead, James, you're on the Alex Jones show.
[1:10:07.160 --> 1:10:14.160]  Hey, Owen, and I appreciate you taking my call because, you know, exactly what she said is exactly what I wanted to speak about.
[1:10:14.160 --> 1:10:20.160]  And I think the question we all have to answer is, where is that line?
[1:10:20.160 --> 1:10:26.160]  Is that line when the leftist officer comes to our door and says, you have to take the vaccine?
[1:10:26.160 --> 1:10:28.160]  Or is it something simple?
[1:10:28.160 --> 1:10:30.160]  You can't go to your church and pray.
[1:10:30.160 --> 1:10:32.160]  You know, that's where it was for me.
[1:10:32.160 --> 1:10:38.160]  Also, the coronavirus hoax, again, I have to say hoax, a hoax, a hoax.
[1:10:38.160 --> 1:10:46.160]  The coronavirus hoax, the shutdown hoax, it completely, it has possibly ruined my career.
[1:10:46.160 --> 1:10:52.160]  As a violinist, I did not get the medical care I needed because of this hoax.
[1:10:52.160 --> 1:11:02.160]  And now we're entering into the race riot, getting ready for us to shut down because of these reasons and just shutting down business.
[1:11:02.160 --> 1:11:09.160]  And of course, we all know it comes from China, but all of the directives come from China, but people are getting their directives here.
[1:11:09.160 --> 1:11:11.160]  Well, it's multi-leveled.
[1:11:11.160 --> 1:11:13.160]  It really is multi-leveled.
[1:11:13.160 --> 1:11:14.160]  You've got the communist movement.
[1:11:14.160 --> 1:11:17.160]  You've got the Chinese propaganda funding a lot of it.
[1:11:17.160 --> 1:11:21.160]  You've got Soros, who's bet against America and on China funding a lot of it.
[1:11:21.160 --> 1:11:24.160]  It's like somebody tried to rigging a sports match, basically.
[1:11:24.160 --> 1:11:29.160]  And then you've got the Democrat Party, which kind of just, you know, they take the money from anywhere, any way they can get it, and they'll do anything.
[1:11:29.160 --> 1:11:32.160]  They're just evil people or blackmailed people at this point.
[1:11:32.160 --> 1:11:39.160]  But, you know, the line in the sand, and that's a key point, too, because nobody's perfect.
[1:11:39.160 --> 1:11:45.160]  But I've now reached a line in the sand where I'm not getting anything made in China.
[1:11:45.160 --> 1:11:47.160]  Now, I'll be honest.
[1:11:47.160 --> 1:11:51.160]  I just got to, I'll be honest, I just got a new pair of shoes, right?
[1:11:51.160 --> 1:11:52.160]  I got a new pair of Nikes.
[1:11:52.160 --> 1:11:55.160]  Some will say, hey, you can't, those are made in China.
[1:11:55.160 --> 1:11:56.160]  I checked. They're not made in China.
[1:11:56.160 --> 1:11:58.160]  They're made in, I think, Indonesia or something.
[1:11:58.160 --> 1:12:00.160]  So is it as good as it is bad?
[1:12:00.160 --> 1:12:04.160]  Well, I don't think Indonesia is trying to take America down.
[1:12:04.160 --> 1:12:10.160]  But so that's like one level where it's like, do I need to go full on and just totally boycott Nike?
[1:12:10.160 --> 1:12:18.160]  But so like, I have crossed that line with the NFL, with the NBA, all the crap that they're sending out about Black Lives Matter,
[1:12:18.160 --> 1:12:20.160]  all the race, because here's what it is.
[1:12:20.160 --> 1:12:23.160]  And then you get it from Netflix, because here's what it really is, folks.
[1:12:23.160 --> 1:12:25.160]  You want to know why I drew the line?
[1:12:25.160 --> 1:12:26.160]  Because you know what it is?
[1:12:26.160 --> 1:12:28.160]  It's racist against white people.
[1:12:28.160 --> 1:12:29.160]  That's what it is.
[1:12:29.160 --> 1:12:31.160]  And I happen to be white.
[1:12:31.160 --> 1:12:32.160]  So you don't like me.
[1:12:32.160 --> 1:12:34.160]  You're racist against white people.
[1:12:34.160 --> 1:12:35.160]  I don't want to give you my money.
[1:12:35.160 --> 1:12:36.160]  It's that simple.
[1:12:36.160 --> 1:12:38.160]  That's called the free market.
[1:12:38.160 --> 1:12:39.160]  And guess what?
[1:12:39.160 --> 1:12:42.160]  Without someone's racist against black people, you don't want to give me your money?
[1:12:42.160 --> 1:12:43.160]  Then don't.
[1:12:43.160 --> 1:12:44.160]  It's just like that.
[1:12:44.160 --> 1:12:46.160]  It's called the free market.
[1:12:46.160 --> 1:12:48.160]  And that's what's beautiful about the free market.
[1:12:48.160 --> 1:12:50.160]  You can have communism in the free market.
[1:12:50.160 --> 1:12:52.160]  You can have anything in the free market.
[1:12:52.160 --> 1:13:00.160]  But you see, that's why communists hate the free market, because the free market always goes towards capitalism and not communism.
[1:13:00.160 --> 1:13:02.160]  So communists have to attack the free market.
[1:13:02.160 --> 1:13:08.160]  Now, I'm getting lost, but my point is all this BLM crap is racist against white people.
[1:13:08.160 --> 1:13:20.160]  And so what do you think it's going to do to young white people now who are going to feel like they're less?
[1:13:20.160 --> 1:13:21.160]  They're just destroying.
[1:13:21.160 --> 1:13:24.160]  The left and the Democrats are destroying Martin Luther King's dream right now.
[1:13:24.160 --> 1:13:25.160]  It's really sad.
[1:13:25.160 --> 1:13:26.160]  Thanks for the call, James.
[1:13:26.160 --> 1:13:28.160]  Logan in Alabama.
[1:13:28.160 --> 1:13:30.160]  You're on the Alex Jones show.
[1:13:30.160 --> 1:13:32.160]  Go ahead.
[1:13:32.160 --> 1:13:33.160]  Hey, Alan.
[1:13:33.160 --> 1:13:34.160]  Hello.
[1:13:34.160 --> 1:13:35.160]  I'm beyond, man.
[1:13:35.160 --> 1:13:36.160]  You there?
[1:13:36.160 --> 1:13:37.160]  Yep.
[1:13:37.160 --> 1:13:38.160]  All right.
[1:13:38.160 --> 1:13:46.160]  I think it's time to reanalyze this whole situation from when all this mess starts till now.
[1:13:46.160 --> 1:13:57.160]  I was good with the analysis that this was the counterattack by the globalists in China to stop the nationalist movement going on around the world.
[1:13:57.160 --> 1:14:04.160]  But I think it's time to at least consider that maybe we were duped by Trump to begin with.
[1:14:04.160 --> 1:14:27.160]  And what if Trump was to give us a false sense of reality, to give us a sense of a false victory, and to marginalize and capture the nationalist movement, and to neuter us by putting our faith in this person only to find out that they were just going to ram this stuff through, quote, unquote, warp speed the whole time.
[1:14:27.160 --> 1:14:37.160]  And what if he's in on it, and what if our only way to really fight back is for groups like Info Wars and the alternative media to propose an alternative candidate.
[1:14:37.160 --> 1:14:41.160]  And I don't care what the conservatives say, oh, you're going to fracture the election.
[1:14:41.160 --> 1:14:42.160]  You know what?
[1:14:42.160 --> 1:14:43.160]  Whatever.
[1:14:43.160 --> 1:14:45.160]  Because at this point, look what all has happened under Trump.
[1:14:45.160 --> 1:14:47.160]  We can't just keep giving him a pass.
[1:14:47.160 --> 1:14:49.160]  Oh, he's playing 3D chess.
[1:14:49.160 --> 1:14:50.160]  Oh, you know, he knows things.
[1:14:50.160 --> 1:14:54.160]  Yeah, I was going for it, but now, now I'm like, no, you know what?
[1:14:54.160 --> 1:14:56.160]  He has the capabilities to do things.
[1:14:56.160 --> 1:14:58.160]  Okay, we know what he can do.
[1:14:58.160 --> 1:15:02.160]  We know he has enough evidence to start going after people.
[1:15:02.160 --> 1:15:06.160]  And I'm tired of giving him a pass while this is going on.
[1:15:06.160 --> 1:15:08.160]  We do not have to be.
[1:15:08.160 --> 1:15:09.160]  Go ahead.
[1:15:09.160 --> 1:15:10.160]  Well, I would agree with you.
[1:15:10.160 --> 1:15:12.160]  We're running out of time here.
[1:15:12.160 --> 1:15:15.160]  I don't think that Trump was always aimed against us.
[1:15:15.160 --> 1:15:23.160]  If anything, he got compromised along the way or just lost his momentum or just lost, just just got burned out.
[1:15:23.160 --> 1:15:29.160]  But, you know, here, here was my big thing because I always said I'd give, I'd give Trump four years to really drain the swamp.
[1:15:29.160 --> 1:15:30.160]  He needs it.
[1:15:30.160 --> 1:15:37.160]  But, you know, when he, when he postponed and he moved his, his rally in Tulsa this weekend, to me, that was the worst thing he's done yet.
[1:15:37.160 --> 1:15:41.160]  And it seems so menial and tiny and it's not a big deal.
[1:15:41.160 --> 1:15:44.160]  But folks, people, people plan a whole weekend.
[1:15:44.160 --> 1:15:45.160]  People plan to be there that night.
[1:15:45.160 --> 1:15:49.160]  They booked hotels and flights and they had to reschedule all of it.
[1:15:49.160 --> 1:15:54.160]  I mean, that was to me the first time he really betrayed his people, but hey, they're still loyal to him.
[1:15:54.160 --> 1:15:57.160]  So he figures he's just going to keep doing it.
[1:15:57.160 --> 1:16:00.160]  I was talking to my Patriots supplier, great suppliers.
[1:16:00.160 --> 1:16:03.160]  You can now say four weeks on average for storeable food.
[1:16:03.160 --> 1:16:04.160]  It's the highest quality.
[1:16:04.160 --> 1:16:05.160]  They've got it.
[1:16:05.160 --> 1:16:12.160]  Use this little rest we have caught in the current to come up to the service, get some air before you get sucked back down.
[1:16:12.160 --> 1:16:14.160]  I personally am ordering more storeable food.
[1:16:14.160 --> 1:16:17.160]  I have to now start going into defense posture.
[1:16:17.160 --> 1:16:23.160]  80% offense, but I've always been 100% offense, trying to fully, you know, stop the globalists.
[1:16:23.160 --> 1:16:24.160]  I mean, give them a good run.
[1:16:24.160 --> 1:16:26.160]  And I think down the road, they'll be defeated.
[1:16:26.160 --> 1:16:30.160]  But we are going to still go down the hard road now.
[1:16:30.160 --> 1:16:31.160]  There were a lot worse roads.
[1:16:31.160 --> 1:16:36.160]  We'd probably go down, but we've mitigated some of this, but it's still going to be bad, my view.
[1:16:36.160 --> 1:16:38.160]  You need to get high quality storeable food.
[1:16:38.160 --> 1:16:39.160]  It's something you need.
[1:16:39.160 --> 1:16:43.160]  We have high quality ready to get out to you and it supports the broadcast and 360 wins.
[1:16:43.160 --> 1:16:48.160]  Please take care of your storeable foods needs at infowarstore.com and get your orders in now.
[1:16:48.160 --> 1:16:49.160]  So you get it.
[1:16:49.160 --> 1:16:50.160]  So you have it.
[1:16:50.160 --> 1:16:51.160]  It's in great containers.
[1:16:51.160 --> 1:16:52.160]  High quality.
[1:16:52.160 --> 1:16:53.160]  Last 25 years.
[1:16:53.160 --> 1:16:58.160]  Get it while you can because if you think things are about to let up, you ain't seen nothing yet.
[1:16:58.160 --> 1:17:01.160]  The United States is not communist China.
[1:17:01.160 --> 1:17:04.160]  We don't have 3 million people in concentration camps.
[1:17:04.160 --> 1:17:06.160]  We don't blow up churches.
[1:17:06.160 --> 1:17:09.160]  We don't kill political dissidents and sell their organs.
[1:17:09.160 --> 1:17:18.160]  But all of the news, we see UN billable indicates, WHO, mainstream corporate media praising communist China for their response.
[1:17:18.160 --> 1:17:24.160]  And if communist China shoots women at checkpoints and welds people into their houses and has robots controlling people,
[1:17:24.160 --> 1:17:26.160]  well then gee, we've got to do that.
[1:17:26.160 --> 1:17:31.160]  And on top of it, cities like San Antonio passed laws saying we'll arrest you if you say Chinese virus.
[1:17:31.160 --> 1:17:35.160]  Well now Cuomo in New York is calling it the European virus.
[1:17:35.160 --> 1:17:40.160]  These people are out of control, control freaks, and they are going to lose big time
[1:17:40.160 --> 1:17:45.160]  because we the people are aware of their criminal activities and are exposing them in their power grab.
[1:17:45.160 --> 1:17:49.160]  The resistance lives at band.video and infowarstore.com.
[1:17:49.160 --> 1:18:06.160]  Spread those links and jam it down the censor's throats and then we'll be able to defeat their operation that much quicker.
[1:18:20.160 --> 1:18:27.160]  I have been using the new X2 spray every day and I feel good knowing that I have the power of true nascent iodine working for my body.
[1:18:27.160 --> 1:18:29.160]  I can personally feel the difference.
[1:18:29.160 --> 1:18:37.160]  We know iodine is an essential mineral that supports thyroid health as well as healthy metabolism, healthy hormone levels, and healthy cognitive function.
[1:18:37.160 --> 1:18:42.160]  Iodine may also support your body and healthy response to environmental and dietary toxins.

[1:19:25.160 --> 1:19:35.160]  I'm going to be using the new X2 spray for 33% off at infowarstore.com.
[1:19:55.160 --> 1:20:01.160]  That means a lot to me. Thank you to all your truck drivers. We love you.
[1:20:01.160 --> 1:20:27.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:20:27.160 --> 1:20:32.160]  From the infowarstore.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:32.160 --> 1:20:41.160]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[1:20:41.160 --> 1:20:47.160]  It's just crazy. I don't know. I mean, getting back to what the last caller brought up about Trump.
[1:20:47.160 --> 1:20:53.160]  I mean, everything is aimed against Trump. The entire evil establishment is aimed against Trump.
[1:20:53.160 --> 1:21:03.160]  In that sense, he's good. But you look at everything we're doing and you can't deny that this is happening under Trump's watch.
[1:21:03.160 --> 1:21:15.160]  And I don't know. Like I said, I mean, of all the things that we've seen to me, well, I'll just leave it right there.
[1:21:15.160 --> 1:21:17.160]  And let's go back to the phone calls in a second.
[1:21:17.160 --> 1:21:30.160]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, a street preacher goes into Chaz and is just reading the Bible and is immediately assaulted, confronted, assaulted, choked out.
[1:21:30.160 --> 1:21:43.160]  They sexually assaulted him as well, made him kiss a gay guy. And now here he is being drug out of the scene after he is assaulted by a guy in a Black Lives Matter shirt, a white guy.
[1:21:43.160 --> 1:21:54.160]  I mean, this is the clown world. This is the total clown world.
[1:21:54.160 --> 1:22:01.160]  Hey, man, love and peace. America's so racist and anti-human, so we're all about love and peace. We established Chaz.
[1:22:01.160 --> 1:22:13.160]  Okay, guy comes in. Jesus saves. Love God, the Creator. We're all beautiful people. Get over here. You can get over and talk that man. Make him kiss a gay guy.
[1:22:13.160 --> 1:22:28.160]  Yeah, lick his face. All right, knock him out. Now drag him out. Peace and love, man. Peace and love. Just let me assault you and choke you out and lick your face.
[1:22:28.160 --> 1:22:37.160]  Look at this. Oh my God. Look at this fake police officer. Hold on. Are you guys seeing this one? Rear it back a second. Pause it.
[1:22:37.160 --> 1:22:54.160]  There's a fake police officer out here, fully decked out in Nike, and she's got a bulletproof vest that appears, some form of body armor, and little, like, wrist protectors.
[1:22:54.160 --> 1:23:08.160]  Like, riot gear, wrist protectors or something. So they've replaced the real police with butch lesbian police who don't have guns.
[1:23:08.160 --> 1:23:21.160]  I don't know. It's just sad to see this happen in America, folks. This is the total result of the media brainwashing, total result of all the anti-American propaganda,
[1:23:21.160 --> 1:23:27.160]  total result of the failed education system.
[1:23:27.160 --> 1:23:36.160]  And I mean, yeah, we get upset at Trump. Like I said, I'm more upset with Trump for postponing his rally for Friday, moving it to Saturday. To me, that was the worst thing he's ever done.
[1:23:36.160 --> 1:23:43.160]  I'm not even joking. That was like a personal, like, you know, forget the people who actually support him. I mean, what is Trump supposed to do about that, though?
[1:23:43.160 --> 1:23:51.160]  What is Trump really supposed to do about jazz? What can Trump really do about these brainwash fools?
[1:23:51.160 --> 1:24:00.160]  I mean, I would put a projector up in the Rose Garden, show them all the Project Veritas videos, show them what you got to show them, show them the evidence, do something.
[1:24:00.160 --> 1:24:05.160]  Because, man, I mean, the left is just going to continue to destroy American folks. I don't know how else to put it.
[1:24:05.160 --> 1:24:17.160]  And the propaganda is just going to get worse. And the more we allow it to happen, the farther it's going to go. And you're literally not going to be able to do anything at all unless you take the mark of the beast, whatever it may be.
[1:24:17.160 --> 1:24:23.160]  Let's go back out to the phone lines. Davo in Kansas. Go ahead, Davo.
[1:24:23.160 --> 1:24:40.160]  Good. Thank you. Hey, just a quick point about the Trump changing the date on his rally. You know, they really been pushing here in the fourth date, the massacre at the Wall Street, basically.
[1:24:40.160 --> 1:24:50.160]  And so that might have something to do with it. But yeah, there was that. And then it doesn't matter. It was he catered to the media and through all his supporters under the bus to me.
[1:24:50.160 --> 1:25:00.160]  That that's what that was to me. So everybody had to rebook hotels and rebook flights. Probably cost him money. I'm not going to lie. Cost me about 500 bucks.
[1:25:00.160 --> 1:25:08.160]  So yeah, that's that's true. But I mean, you know how the media rolls with it and taking throw him under the bus as quick as they can, they're going to do it.
[1:25:08.160 --> 1:25:16.160]  And he may he may end up canceling the whole thing. See, because that's what I'm saying. You give them an inch, they take everything. I'm sorry, go ahead.
[1:25:16.160 --> 1:25:29.160]  Well, and my main call was they're already pushing the second wave here in Southeast Kansas. Joplin reported 12 cases of in the hospital. We have four cases here in Pittsburgh.
[1:25:29.160 --> 1:25:42.160]  They report so that their numbers were so low and we're on that, you know, they they're they're starting to boost the numbers up and trying to really push the second wave.
[1:25:42.160 --> 1:25:49.160]  Yeah, they're going to push a second wave. Who knows, they may even release another one intentionally. I mean, who these people are capable of anything.
[1:25:49.160 --> 1:25:56.160]  And until Bill Gates and Obama and the rest of them are in jail, we're just going to have to put up with this, folks. I mean, or well, right.
[1:25:56.160 --> 1:26:01.160]  All right, Ronnie in Virginia. Thanks for the call. They will Ronnie in Virginia. Go ahead.
[1:26:01.160 --> 1:26:07.160]  What's up, Owen? Man, this one's I love you and the whole crew. Thank you, Ronnie. We love you too.
[1:26:07.160 --> 1:26:18.160]  No problem, man. I am an eternal optimist, but, you know, lately things have been it's been tough to take. I don't see how this thing ends, man, without a bunch of violence come up in November.
[1:26:18.160 --> 1:26:22.160]  Either side wins the other side, you know, I don't know.
[1:26:22.160 --> 1:26:31.160]  Well, let's be here. Let's rationalize what you're saying here. The left has already gone violent. The left has already gone to violence for their means to an end.
[1:26:31.160 --> 1:26:41.160]  So they're already there. The question is, when does when does America, when do American patriots rise up, when do veterans rise up, when do Trump supporters rise up, when do conservatives rise up, when do Christians rise up.
[1:26:41.160 --> 1:26:50.160]  So that's kind of my response to you real quick is just let's be clear here. The left has already gone violent in their movement because they have no real political movement.
[1:26:50.160 --> 1:26:57.160]  They have illegal election theft and they have propaganda and they have fake virtue signaling and it's not working anymore.
[1:26:57.160 --> 1:27:03.160]  So they've gone to full violence and then using the power they have in government to shut down the economy.
[1:27:03.160 --> 1:27:15.160]  So they've already gone now. The question is, when do we fight back? And you're right. At this rate, unless we have something done legally with the Justice Department or we have to wait till the election, it's going to become a fight.
[1:27:15.160 --> 1:27:22.160]  Exactly. And at what point, like you were saying, are we giving up the advantage that we may have by not acting?
[1:27:22.160 --> 1:27:34.160]  How long do we wait? Well, I mean, how much more can we take as the country as a people? We have to step up, man. We can't let this continue for our children's sake, for the future's sake, for what's right.
[1:27:34.160 --> 1:27:37.160]  And I'm tired of that. I'm so tired of it.
[1:27:37.160 --> 1:27:49.160]  And we're living so many lies. That's what's so sad about all this. All the lies that our children are being forced to believe, like the lies from Black Lives Matter, the lies about the coronavirus, just the lies about Donald Trump.
[1:27:49.160 --> 1:27:57.160]  They're trying to cement all of these lives into our children heads. Think about how brainwashed, I mean, it's just, and so stupefied that they're, it's unbelievable.
[1:27:57.160 --> 1:28:02.160]  Ronnie, thanks for the call. Tim in Chicago, I got 50 seconds left. I'm giving you the final 50 seconds. Go ahead.
[1:28:02.160 --> 1:28:10.160]  Oh, I love you guys. Everything you guys do is great. I had a real quick thing off topic. I'm totally in agreement with the rest of you guys.
[1:28:10.160 --> 1:28:25.160]  I'd love to see InfoWars media stuff for computer backgrounds, iPhone backgrounds, almost like Pythagoras with the ics in his hand, you know, to be able to show other people like, you know, here, look at this, you know, like wallpapers, etc.
[1:28:25.160 --> 1:28:35.160]  Because you guys do such a good job. But I think everything else is totally, it's definitely a thing devised by people.
[1:28:35.160 --> 1:28:42.160]  I don't think it's, you know, it's definitely a fake virus, but you've given hospitals money for all the cases they have.
[1:28:42.160 --> 1:28:56.160]  You've given hospitals money, you've made people change their lives. I mean, hell, you walk around town, people are wearing masks. I mean, that's literally like I make up something like, hey, there's an invisible grubworm that climbs up your legs.
[1:28:56.160 --> 1:28:58.160]  You have to wear socks and everybody wears socks or something.
[1:28:58.160 --> 1:29:08.160]  This is Rob Dew here with infowarsstore.com and I want to tell you about something that I think has really helped me out and I think can help you out too, especially if you have any problems sleeping.
[1:29:08.160 --> 1:29:17.160]  And that's knockout. Let's face it, our life patterns have been disrupted by this lockdown, this government imposed imprisonment, and it has definitely affected my sleep schedule.
[1:29:17.160 --> 1:29:23.160]  But one thing that has helped is knockout. I take one pill about an hour before I want to go to bed and boom, I get a great night's sleep.
[1:29:23.160 --> 1:29:29.160]  And just this past Memorial Day, I took two of them fell asleep about 1am, woke up at 8am, ready to go.
[1:29:29.160 --> 1:29:33.160]  It really has made a difference in my life and it can make a difference in your life too.
[1:29:33.160 --> 1:29:38.160]  If you don't get any sleep, you're going to be a grouch. If you get great sleep, you're going to be on point. You're going to be mentally focused.
[1:29:38.160 --> 1:29:46.160]  You're going to be ready to take on the day. And right now, knockout is 50% off. It's less than $15 a bottle. You get 30 capsules.

[1:29:53.160 --> 1:30:18.160]  It's knockout and it's available at infowarstore.com.
[1:30:18.160 --> 1:30:26.160]  We've got to ask ourselves what's coming next. I can tell you, it's going to be a bunch of big old fat mass shootings to create even a bigger race war.
[1:30:26.160 --> 1:30:34.160]  It's going to be economic collapse, China invading Taiwan, Hong Kong, you name it. The globalists are attacking on every front.
[1:30:34.160 --> 1:30:42.160]  That's why now, more than ever, we have to realize they tried to censor info wars off the air because they knew that when they launched this whole situation,
[1:30:42.160 --> 1:30:49.160]  that they didn't want the people's voice to still be on air. But thanks to you and our crew, we are still on air.
[1:30:49.160 --> 1:30:53.160]  So let's boost that transmission like the Batman signal now more than ever.
[1:30:53.160 --> 1:31:19.160]  info wars.com lives.

[1:33:00.160 --> 1:33:08.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:08.160 --> 1:33:30.160]  Broadcasting live from the UN stronghold Austin, Texas. You're listening to the Alex Jones show and now your host Owen Troyer.
[1:33:30.160 --> 1:33:39.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're about to go back live to the nation of Chazz where Rob is standing by.
[1:33:39.160 --> 1:34:01.160]  He's a little perturbed right now because he tried to start a game of organized kickball and one of the Antifa members there tried to kick the ball, literally broke his foot, his metatarsals, about 30 of them totally smashed.
[1:34:01.160 --> 1:34:10.160]  So they had to travel him to another hospital. They don't have any gas currently in Chazz. They're trying to get that situation figured out. No energy going in.
[1:34:10.160 --> 1:34:19.160]  But they were safely able to get the poor Antifa member who broke his foot attempting to play kickball to a hospital outside of town. So Rob is going to have that story and more for us coming up.
[1:34:19.160 --> 1:34:32.160]  Folks, it's just, it's joke level at this point. Okay. There is a Black Lives Matter protest happening in Brooklyn right now with, I mean, I don't know, the streets are shoulder to shoulder, but you can't have your business.
[1:34:32.160 --> 1:34:48.160]  You can't open a business. You can't have full capacity of a business. You need to wear a mask. You need to do this. You need to do that. And so they're setting this precedent where everything is illegal except protesting for a leftist cause.
[1:34:48.160 --> 1:34:57.160]  Because remember, we organized protests to reopen and I lost my final social media account. Twitter took my account for promoting these events.
[1:34:57.160 --> 1:35:09.160]  People were attacked. People were arrested. The media said, oh, these are demon people. How dare they go out during a pandemic that we faked? Oh, but then their people go out and it's, oh man, look at these heroes.
[1:35:09.160 --> 1:35:19.160]  And so now they've made it ordinary that just doing anything that's leftist activism is always okay, but everything else must be shut down.
[1:35:19.160 --> 1:35:29.160]  Of course, when you're George Soros and Barack Obama and the rest of them, that's exactly what you would want when you know that you belong in jail for the rest of your life.
[1:35:29.160 --> 1:35:44.160]  Now, let's go back to the nation of chess where Rob is joining us. Rob, I'm sorry that the game of kickball was ruined after one of the members broke his foot attempting to kick the ball, but you are out there on the field.
[1:35:44.160 --> 1:35:56.160]  So, so what's going on? I noticed people are hanging out on this Astro turf baseball field. Is that like where the big joint circle is or they're playing the bongos or there's a hacky sack tournament? What's going on?
[1:35:56.160 --> 1:36:07.160]  You brought, you set me up for a nice big conversation here talking about George Soros, but right now you're completely right, man. We will switch from kickball. Don't worry. We went to dodgeball.
[1:36:07.160 --> 1:36:12.160]  We had an intense game of dodgeball. Wait, you guys are allowed to play dodgeball? They took dodgeball out of the schools.
[1:36:12.160 --> 1:36:18.160]  Dude, and the best thing was liberal privilege strikes again.
[1:36:18.160 --> 1:36:28.160]  Dude, and the most crazy thing about it being liberal privilege, it was black versus white. Like it wasn't even like diversitized or anything. It was literally black versus white.
[1:36:28.160 --> 1:36:38.160]  And that's kind of the the ideology that I'm seeing out here is I look around and you see we see more white people than you do back people.
[1:36:38.160 --> 1:36:45.160]  It's kind of insane. You look at all the pictures and all the protests across the world and it's more white people out here than black people.
[1:36:45.160 --> 1:36:53.160]  You don't really see, you see some people with Black Lives Matter shirts, but there's not any conversation going on about how do we do this? What do we do?
[1:36:53.160 --> 1:37:03.160]  It's just the same maybe one or two talking points from random people walking around, but it's just like as racist as people are going to say this is, it's just like the statistic show.
[1:37:03.160 --> 1:37:16.160]  It's just like there's less whites coming blacks than there is blacks coming blacks. You can see it in the pictures. You put the stats and pictures side by side and that's exactly what you get out here.
[1:37:16.160 --> 1:37:23.160]  On the party side out here, I mean you have a concert right behind me. You have one right over there. You have one right over there.
[1:37:23.160 --> 1:37:25.160]  It's the Chazz Music Festival 2020.
[1:37:25.160 --> 1:37:27.160]  It literally is man.
[1:37:27.160 --> 1:37:29.160]  Chazz City Limits.
[1:37:29.160 --> 1:37:35.160]  All the people who were in quarantine this entire time had something to do now. Exactly. This is what it is.
[1:37:35.160 --> 1:37:42.160]  And one of the funniest things is man, I was walking by this morning trying to get some b-roll for, you know, seeing what it's like in the mornings, the aftermath.
[1:37:42.160 --> 1:37:49.160]  And it was crazy. People were actually cleaning and you walk by the armed guards and they come up to you. Hey, what's up man? How's it going?
[1:37:49.160 --> 1:37:52.160]  And it's kind of just like, let's see how far this goes.
[1:37:52.160 --> 1:38:01.160]  Oh, nice to do it. How are you doing today? Oh, you know, just kind of saving this fight in the fight. Oh, I'm going to the store. You need anything? Oh, no, we're good. We just got some Starbucks.
[1:38:01.160 --> 1:38:07.160]  I was literally the conversation I had about getting them delivered.
[1:38:07.160 --> 1:38:10.160]  They're getting the $6 latte?
[1:38:10.160 --> 1:38:12.160]  Ben and Jerry's just left.
[1:38:12.160 --> 1:38:14.160]  They sold out of soy.
[1:38:14.160 --> 1:38:20.160]  No, and that's why we had to switch from kickball to dodgeball.
[1:38:20.160 --> 1:38:26.160]  Wait a second. Hold on though. They found the b-roll of the dodgeball game. Did they actually make it Blacks versus whites?
[1:38:26.160 --> 1:38:29.160]  Dude, that's exactly what it was when we got there.
[1:38:29.160 --> 1:38:31.160]  You're joking.
[1:38:31.160 --> 1:38:35.160]  No, I'm not. If you see the b-roll, I mean, what is it?
[1:38:35.160 --> 1:38:40.160]  I don't know. It's hard to tell. Everyone's got masks on and people are kind of just running around. There doesn't seem to be much organization.
[1:38:40.160 --> 1:38:47.160]  Oh, okay. Maybe we got another little bit more cut on there. But yeah, dude, that's exactly what it was.
[1:38:47.160 --> 1:38:53.160]  I mean, I assume you were kidding, but I guess I shouldn't be surprised by anything these people do these days.
[1:38:53.160 --> 1:38:59.160]  Yeah, man, and right behind this actual concert venue is all the tents where people are actually staying.
[1:38:59.160 --> 1:39:04.160]  I mean, look at that bang and concert venue, though. I mean, communism provides a really nice venue.
[1:39:04.160 --> 1:39:11.160]  I mean, you wouldn't want like a big stage with big sound effects and lighting effects and fireworks and, you know, a theater type atmosphere.
[1:39:11.160 --> 1:39:13.160]  You just want to stand on a baseball field.
[1:39:13.160 --> 1:39:15.160]  Exactly. A fake one.
[1:39:15.160 --> 1:39:18.160]  That's pre-market communism, dude.
[1:39:18.160 --> 1:39:24.160]  I haven't seen any showers out here. I haven't seen, they have, they have quarter parties.
[1:39:24.160 --> 1:39:30.160]  But, like, for the actual activism part, they say it's going on. There's no activism there.
[1:39:30.160 --> 1:39:33.160]  Yeah, they seem pretty inactive on that field.
[1:39:33.160 --> 1:39:34.160]  Yeah.
[1:39:34.160 --> 1:39:39.160]  I mean, we all know, I mean, Ten Bong hits. I mean, it's tough. But hey, let me ask you this.
[1:39:39.160 --> 1:39:44.160]  Those apartment buildings behind you, are people still living in them or what?
[1:39:44.160 --> 1:39:51.160]  Some of them, yes. Some of them, like, over here, it has BLM in there off their balcony.
[1:39:51.160 --> 1:39:57.160]  So, there is some people still living out here. The businesses that are, there's some that are still open.
[1:39:57.160 --> 1:40:03.160]  They have, they're boarded up, but you can still go in some of them. They have, they close early and it's only takeout.
[1:40:03.160 --> 1:40:08.160]  But, and another crazy thing is that they're being compliant.
[1:40:08.160 --> 1:40:15.160]  They're saying, for the processors to come in, you have free food, you have, you can have a charging, you have a charging station, you have free water.
[1:40:15.160 --> 1:40:20.160]  So, you know, a lot of the businesses aren't really, they're not helping their own cause, really.
[1:40:20.160 --> 1:40:21.160]  So.
[1:40:21.160 --> 1:40:25.160]  Well, here's what the people are really wondering right now, okay? And this is the last question I'm going to have for you.
[1:40:25.160 --> 1:40:28.160]  It's been, it's been tough out for you and Chas. You're working hard.
[1:40:28.160 --> 1:40:33.160]  And I'm sure you want to get back to that concert. I see there's a joint circle too. Maybe kick a hacky sack around.
[1:40:33.160 --> 1:40:34.160]  Okay, but seriously.
[1:40:34.160 --> 1:40:36.160]  Yeah, it's a meditation circle, man.
[1:40:36.160 --> 1:40:40.160]  Oh, oh, oh, I didn't realize it was that deep. So Eastern philosophy.
[1:40:40.160 --> 1:40:44.160]  But, but, but let me, cause this is what people really want to know. I mean, the people are really tuned in.
[1:40:44.160 --> 1:40:50.160]  They usually, uh, there's a lot of single guys are wondering, I mean, are the women of Chas, are they fine?
[1:40:50.160 --> 1:40:53.160]  I mean, the women of Chas, what are we talking here?
[1:40:53.160 --> 1:40:56.160]  Oh, man.
[1:40:56.160 --> 1:40:57.160]  It's, it's.
[1:40:57.160 --> 1:40:58.160]  Have you seen?
[1:40:58.160 --> 1:40:59.160]  No, it's Horace.
[1:40:59.160 --> 1:41:01.160]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, there's a good amount.
[1:41:01.160 --> 1:41:06.160]  How much, what percentage of the women of Chas sport the armpit hair?
[1:41:06.160 --> 1:41:09.160]  Oh dude, 60%.
[1:41:09.160 --> 1:41:11.160]  Oh, 60.
[1:41:11.160 --> 1:41:13.160]  That's kind of being on the fair side.
[1:41:13.160 --> 1:41:17.160]  They're not boycotting a deodorant. Are they?
[1:41:17.160 --> 1:41:21.160]  I haven't seen that in the free selection. Just put it that way.
[1:41:21.160 --> 1:41:22.160]  Oh boy.
[1:41:22.160 --> 1:41:23.160]  So all right.
[1:41:23.160 --> 1:41:30.160]  Well, if anybody was wondering if they're trying to look for a woman in Chas, if you're into armpit hair, well, then I think Chas has got what you're looking for.
[1:41:30.160 --> 1:41:32.160]  Most definitely, man.
[1:41:32.160 --> 1:41:34.160]  All right. Well, look, I don't want to distract you.
[1:41:34.160 --> 1:41:39.160]  There's a music festival going on a hacky sacs, bongo meditation drum circle that I show you.
[1:41:39.160 --> 1:41:42.160]  No, you guys are doing great work. Keep uploading the videos.
[1:41:42.160 --> 1:41:47.160]  We'll make sure we get some of those up at band and maybe we'll have you guys back on tomorrow as well.
[1:41:47.160 --> 1:41:49.160]  You guys just don't, just don't declare.
[1:41:49.160 --> 1:41:52.160]  Are you, are you officially Chas Estonian yet?
[1:41:52.160 --> 1:41:56.160]  Not yet, man. They haven't, maybe when they get that deodorant, maybe that.
[1:41:56.160 --> 1:42:01.160]  Okay. He's considering, he's considering citizenship. He still likes America folks.
[1:42:01.160 --> 1:42:04.160]  All right. Oh, let me ask you one more question.
[1:42:04.160 --> 1:42:09.160]  Are you allowed, do they have, they've separated like whites only and blacks only, right?
[1:42:09.160 --> 1:42:11.160]  Yeah, yeah, pretty much.
[1:42:11.160 --> 1:42:18.160]  So are you, are you allowed to go use the farm that they have that they put on cardboard that's not going to grow anything?
[1:42:18.160 --> 1:42:22.160]  Yes, I am. I really am. It's right behind me on this side.
[1:42:22.160 --> 1:42:27.160]  Oh, okay. Good. You get access. The vegetables are, the poison is going to be accessed for everybody.
[1:42:27.160 --> 1:42:32.160]  All right. Good. Well, my black, excuse me, my white ass wouldn't be allowed in there, but I'm glad that, I'm glad that.
[1:42:32.160 --> 1:42:39.160]  All right. Ladies and gentlemen, there you go. Our brave crew up in Chas, you may find them in a hacky sack circle.
[1:42:39.160 --> 1:42:42.160]  You never know folks, but they're on the ground.
[1:42:42.160 --> 1:42:45.160]  Hey, it's all possible with your support at infowarestore.com.
[1:42:45.160 --> 1:42:48.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, please continue to support us so we can continue to give you this coverage.
[1:42:48.160 --> 1:42:52.160]  No, they folks, Soros and the rest of them, Obama, they didn't think we'd be on the air still.
[1:42:52.160 --> 1:42:57.160]  We're still on the air. Every day we're on the air. You're kicking Soros in the nuts.
[1:42:57.160 --> 1:43:01.160]  Aerodyne Technology Delivery System.
[1:43:01.160 --> 1:43:08.160]  The first of its kind, pure, nascent, atomic iodine that can be delivered through a spray bottle.
[1:43:08.160 --> 1:43:14.160]  The next level of innovation of X2 is here, introducing Survival Shield X2 Spray.
[1:43:14.160 --> 1:43:17.160]  The great part about the X2 Spray is it's great on the go.
[1:43:17.160 --> 1:43:21.160]  When you've got it in the dropper, it's great at your house. It's great at work.
[1:43:21.160 --> 1:43:24.160]  But this is great for the car. It's great to keep with you.
[1:43:24.160 --> 1:43:31.160]  And again, it's also good for the throat and mouth to get the effects of iodine, not to just ingest it into the stomach.
[1:43:31.160 --> 1:43:34.160]  We're really excited about it. It's 33% off out of the gates.
[1:43:34.160 --> 1:43:40.160]  It was listeners' idea asking for us to come up with a spray bottle that had us talk to the scientists and developers
[1:43:40.160 --> 1:43:46.160]  and come up with a system that aerosolizes it and delivers it to the body in a new and in some ways, even better way.
[1:43:46.160 --> 1:43:52.160]  Get your Survival Shield X2 nascent iodine spray now at 33% off at infowarstore.com
[1:43:52.160 --> 1:44:18.160]  and experience the power of aerosolized X2 nascent iodine for yourself.
[1:44:23.160 --> 1:44:30.160]  We've given them a good run, and I think down the road they'll be defeated, but we're going to still go down the hard road now.
[1:44:30.160 --> 1:44:36.160]  There were a lot worse roads we'd probably go down, but we've mitigated some of this, but it's still going to be bad in my view.
[1:44:36.160 --> 1:44:39.160]  You need to get high-quality survival food. It's something you need.
[1:44:39.160 --> 1:44:42.160]  We have high-quality, ready to get out to you, and it supports the broadcast.

[1:44:52.160 --> 1:44:57.160]  Last 25 years, get it while you can, because if you think things are about to let up, you ain't seen nothing yet.
[1:44:57.160 --> 1:45:04.160]  I don't like coming to you every day on the radio and TV stations that you watch and listen to a song and telling you all these horrible things,
[1:45:04.160 --> 1:45:08.160]  but you notice almost everything we've talked about, horrible, has come true.
[1:45:08.160 --> 1:45:12.160]  We were warning everybody to try to stop it.
[1:45:12.160 --> 1:45:19.160]  It's like telling somebody, if you've got a pool, put a fence around it, if you have little kids, because even if they're good swimmers, they can hit their head and drown.
[1:45:19.160 --> 1:45:22.160]  People don't listen. They go out, and their kids dead in the pool.
[1:45:22.160 --> 1:45:26.160]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, this is the death of the Third World and the collapse of the First World.
[1:45:26.160 --> 1:45:33.160]  And this is 21st-century warfare carried out by the globalists, and they admit they've orchestrated it.
[1:45:33.160 --> 1:45:43.160]  They admit it's, quote, good to save the Earth, and they're teaching us to be more frugal, and they want to make us poor so they can dictate our surrender to this post-human technocracy.
[1:45:43.160 --> 1:45:50.160]  I know all this sounds insane when I was talking about it 25 years ago, but now it's public because it's their operations manual.
[1:45:50.160 --> 1:45:57.160]  I wish this wasn't the case, but there really are evil psychopaths in control of most major institutions, and we've got to stop them.
[1:45:57.160 --> 1:46:04.160]  What are champions made of? Here's a man who can show you.
[1:46:04.160 --> 1:46:30.160]  AAAAHHH!

[1:47:24.760 --> 1:47:34.480]  your host Owen Troyer. All right we're about to go back to Alex Jones folks I'm
[1:47:34.480 --> 1:47:38.240]  sitting here laughing to myself because it's just so ridiculous can you imagine
[1:47:38.240 --> 1:47:44.160]  a bunch of white people running around crying how racist they are against black
[1:47:44.160 --> 1:47:50.080]  people and that's like the story of the day like what I'm sorry it's just it's
[1:47:50.080 --> 1:47:55.840]  literally insane like I don't even know how to explain it I can't even
[1:47:55.840 --> 1:48:01.920]  comprehend it a bunch of honkies running around telling black people how
[1:48:01.920 --> 1:48:07.280]  oppressed they are by white people and they're white running around I mean what
[1:48:07.280 --> 1:48:12.600]  like I just it's just the level of brainwashing stupidity and ignorance is
[1:48:12.600 --> 1:48:18.640]  just it's maxed out I don't know how I don't know how it gets more than this
[1:48:18.640 --> 1:48:23.720]  folks please remember support us infowarstore.com trust me Obama and
[1:48:23.720 --> 1:48:28.360]  Soros and Hillary Clinton and the rest of them they assumed with their
[1:48:28.360 --> 1:48:33.560]  censorship with Tim Cook that we would not still be on air so every day we're
[1:48:33.560 --> 1:48:41.240]  on air you're kicking George Soros in the nuts so support us keep us on air by
[1:48:41.240 --> 1:48:47.320]  shopping at infowarstore.com big specials happening right now at infowarstore.com
[1:48:47.320 --> 1:48:53.640]  we cannot thank you enough for your support and here is Alex Jones one man
[1:48:53.640 --> 1:48:58.600]  dies it's a tragedy 10,000 died so statistic Joseph Stalin said that more
[1:48:58.600 --> 1:49:03.360]  than 70 years ago and it's very true today but still is very sad for Ray
[1:49:03.360 --> 1:49:09.000]  Shard Brooks who was shot dead by Atlanta police who were attempting to arrest him
[1:49:09.000 --> 1:49:15.560]  for what they believe was a DWI should he be dead because he was out that night
[1:49:15.560 --> 1:49:19.920]  at a Wendy's trying to eat a hamburger so he could drive home no the answer is
[1:49:19.920 --> 1:49:23.760]  he shouldn't be dead but if he was completely hammered and ran his car
[1:49:23.760 --> 1:49:28.080]  into somebody else's car and killed innocent person does that person deserve
[1:49:28.080 --> 1:49:33.360]  to die and this comes down to the laws in this country and mothers against drunk
[1:49:33.360 --> 1:49:37.480]  driving and the fact that they now want it where the average person drinks one
[1:49:37.480 --> 1:49:42.320]  beer you go to jail they literally have gotten millions and millions of people
[1:49:42.320 --> 1:49:46.840]  incarcerated in many cases for not even being impaired because sometimes people
[1:49:46.840 --> 1:49:52.640]  are totally hammered and go out and run in to a school bus and kill 10 kids so
[1:49:52.640 --> 1:49:57.560]  it's a balance but I will tell you this I got arrested for DWI I blew under once
[1:49:57.560 --> 1:50:02.320]  I got to the police station and the issue is gonna get dropped because of
[1:50:02.320 --> 1:50:05.760]  COVID-19 everything being shut down for months that's behind schedule but I'm
[1:50:05.760 --> 1:50:08.560]  told that's where it's going because I blew under legal limit but I guarantee
[1:50:08.560 --> 1:50:13.520]  you that if I would have resisted the officers and I'd have taken away one of
[1:50:13.520 --> 1:50:17.240]  their tasers and started punching them I probably would get my ass blown away now
[1:50:17.240 --> 1:50:22.680]  does that mean I deserve to die for that no but we have given the police this
[1:50:22.680 --> 1:50:28.680]  job we have these laws in place and so if we want to decide that we don't have
[1:50:28.680 --> 1:50:32.440]  drunk driving laws or that they've gotten too severe we should go on back I'll
[1:50:32.440 --> 1:50:36.280]  tell you this when I was young even in high school if you weren't drunk the
[1:50:36.280 --> 1:50:39.240]  police would dump your beer out and send you home or they'd call your parents
[1:50:39.240 --> 1:50:44.000]  because they didn't want to ruin your life and most the time police would say
[1:50:44.000 --> 1:50:48.800]  call your family or you'll call friends family if they found young people old
[1:50:48.800 --> 1:50:52.400]  people that were drinking and the officers would have made of the man that
[1:50:52.400 --> 1:50:56.560]  just got killed in Atlanta call family and come get him or they would have
[1:50:56.560 --> 1:51:00.760]  taken the keys away and put them inside Wendy's but because of all the lawsuits
[1:51:00.760 --> 1:51:05.200]  and all the lawyers and all the red tape police can't do that anymore unless
[1:51:05.200 --> 1:51:08.920]  you're in a small town and yes we're not Mayberry anymore I mean the streets at
[1:51:08.920 --> 1:51:12.560]  night are dangerous and all I can tell folks is especially if you've got
[1:51:12.560 --> 1:51:16.680]  teenage children do not let them be out after 10 o'clock at night in a major
[1:51:16.680 --> 1:51:20.200]  city they are dangerous there are crackheads there are homeless there are
[1:51:20.200 --> 1:51:24.480]  mentally ill people everywhere I've been all over this country and we are a
[1:51:24.480 --> 1:51:28.720]  diseased satanic nation there's still a lot of good people in this country but
[1:51:28.720 --> 1:51:32.560]  there are people out of their minds of every race color and creed at night
[1:51:32.560 --> 1:51:38.120]  there are drunks everywhere and I'm not here kissing the police's ass I'm
[1:51:38.120 --> 1:51:42.800]  saying this law and order is starting to break down and more and more good
[1:51:42.800 --> 1:51:45.640]  people don't want to be police officers because they know nobody's gonna back
[1:51:45.640 --> 1:51:50.320]  them up and they're charged with going out and enforcing the law that is the
[1:51:50.320 --> 1:51:54.640]  law and then when things don't go right they get the blame now if I was a
[1:51:54.640 --> 1:51:58.520]  police officer somebody jerked my taser away and was going for my gun or
[1:51:58.520 --> 1:52:01.600]  whatever I don't know what I do and it's still not clear exactly from the dash
[1:52:01.600 --> 1:52:05.280]  cam footage exactly what happened but it was a serious fight and they were
[1:52:05.280 --> 1:52:09.640]  trying to execute the law in the state of Georgia and the city of Atlanta and
[1:52:09.640 --> 1:52:14.760]  it's Wendy's that called the police on him because he was reportedly passed out
[1:52:14.760 --> 1:52:20.320]  there at the window so again the footage is on info wars.com it's another
[1:52:20.320 --> 1:52:24.160]  black man shot in questionable circumstances white people per capita
[1:52:24.160 --> 1:52:29.120]  are twice as likely not just per population per capita to be shot and
[1:52:29.120 --> 1:52:33.160]  killed by police officers because they don't hesitate with white people because
[1:52:33.160 --> 1:52:36.200]  they know there's not the political correctness and in most cases the police
[1:52:36.200 --> 1:52:41.280]  are in the right because they're out there trying to control a country that
[1:52:41.280 --> 1:52:47.280]  uses more drugs than any other nation on earth some metrics show that the United
[1:52:47.280 --> 1:52:53.680]  States uses 10 times more illegal drugs than the next nation that is known for
[1:52:53.680 --> 1:52:58.640]  using a high amount of illegal drugs we are satanic we've aborted 62 million
[1:52:58.640 --> 1:53:03.600]  babies people are bombed out of their brains on average and everybody wishing
[1:53:03.600 --> 1:53:07.200]  for the total abolition of police it's never gonna happen you're gonna get a
[1:53:07.200 --> 1:53:11.320]  collapse and then you're gonna get a serious fascist police state in this
[1:53:11.320 --> 1:53:14.760]  country that'll call itself communist that's how it always works so if you
[1:53:14.760 --> 1:53:17.160]  really don't want electricity you really don't want medicine you really don't
[1:53:17.160 --> 1:53:22.520]  want food you're gonna end up getting it and here's the deal nations go through
[1:53:22.520 --> 1:53:28.400]  cycles they always have they always will and peoples go through cycles read your
[1:53:28.400 --> 1:53:32.160]  history books and we have become fat done and happy and things are falling
[1:53:32.160 --> 1:53:36.600]  apart and the haves and have nots are getting greater and greater separation
[1:53:36.600 --> 1:53:41.040]  and it's the people like Jeff Bezos worth 160 billion and all these other
[1:53:41.040 --> 1:53:45.160]  groups like Apple that literally are involved in slave labor that are
[1:53:45.160 --> 1:53:50.200]  literally involved in propping up communist regimes in China that have
[1:53:50.200 --> 1:53:54.280]  set up the tax laws where they pay almost no taxes and then they virtually
[1:53:54.280 --> 1:53:57.640]  say only have a hundred million dollars like Apple just did the black lives
[1:53:57.640 --> 1:54:02.440]  matter to stir up more infighting as a distraction from what they're doing the
[1:54:02.440 --> 1:54:06.440]  police officers on average are not the enemy the enemy is the globalists and
[1:54:06.440 --> 1:54:11.400]  they're the ones fanning the flames of this entire thing there is a number
[1:54:11.400 --> 1:54:14.840]  that's gone way up and that is the general crime in predominantly black
[1:54:14.840 --> 1:54:18.000]  neighborhoods is off the charts hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of deaths
[1:54:18.000 --> 1:54:21.960]  will be black on black crime and because of the dash cams and because the
[1:54:21.960 --> 1:54:25.280]  police will paralyze they're slow rolling they're not putting themselves in
[1:54:25.280 --> 1:54:28.760]  danger to talk to black coffee talk to white coffee talk to Hispanic couple
[1:54:28.760 --> 1:54:32.800]  all the same thing and that's causing crime to explode in those areas and
[1:54:32.800 --> 1:54:36.960]  black people to die in mass so again statistics don't lie these statistics
[1:54:36.960 --> 1:54:42.880]  are a hundred percent clear and burning down the Wendy's because they call the
[1:54:42.880 --> 1:54:46.240]  police what are you supposed to do when somebody's passed out at the checkout
[1:54:46.240 --> 1:54:49.720]  window or at the droughts your window again we're the ones that expect the
[1:54:49.720 --> 1:54:53.920]  police to do all this and to be janitors for the homeless and to be in the
[1:54:53.920 --> 1:54:57.680]  middle of all this garbage and then when they don't do a perfect job out of a
[1:54:57.680 --> 1:55:04.840]  counter out of the nation of 350 million people what do you expect but again
[1:55:04.840 --> 1:55:09.160]  look at the nation of chess and their warlord they're demanding food water
[1:55:09.160 --> 1:55:14.560]  supplies porta-potties free electricity free everything it's a joke and they're
[1:55:14.560 --> 1:55:19.640]  beating people up for their free speech they're choking and sexually assaulting
[1:55:19.640 --> 1:55:23.720]  these videos are almost unwatchable they're up on infowars.com of a
[1:55:23.720 --> 1:55:29.280]  street preacher who they tackle choke start kissing start humping literally
[1:55:29.280 --> 1:55:33.040]  auntie for saying I'm gay how does it feel these people are completely
[1:55:33.040 --> 1:55:37.080]  entitled and insane and they say we have a border we're deporting you and they
[1:55:37.080 --> 1:55:40.520]  choke him out on the ground and then go throwing over the border in front of the
[1:55:40.520 --> 1:55:45.440]  police and the police do nothing that's paralyzed police that is as useless as
[1:55:45.440 --> 1:55:49.520]  tits on a bore and so if you look at what's happened in London footballers
[1:55:49.520 --> 1:55:52.520]  and others came out to defend Winston Churchill statue peacefully the police
[1:55:52.520 --> 1:55:56.040]  who stood down while the black lives matter communist rampage and attacked
[1:55:56.040 --> 1:55:59.840]  and pulled down British flags and all the rest of it wanted to show folks
[1:55:59.840 --> 1:56:02.880]  they're still tough so the police attacked the people that were pro
[1:56:02.880 --> 1:56:08.480]  Britain and who knew what was going on so that's the police in London run by
[1:56:08.480 --> 1:56:12.960]  leftist globalist literally trying to appease the communist sorrows funded
[1:56:12.960 --> 1:56:18.960]  black lives matter by brutally with billy clubs and running over people with
[1:56:18.960 --> 1:56:23.200]  horses because they dare come out and defend their nation's monuments this is
[1:56:23.200 --> 1:56:27.520]  how the overthrow happens this is how the intimidation happens this is not
[1:56:27.520 --> 1:56:33.280]  fighting the man the most powerful mega corporations on the face of the earth
[1:56:33.280 --> 1:56:38.440]  are on record financing and coordinating all of this and trying to
[1:56:38.440 --> 1:56:44.360]  normalize what we're witnessing and now the COVID-19 round two of the lockdown
[1:56:44.360 --> 1:56:49.320]  is here we knew was coming with all these line headlines about spikes when
[1:56:49.320 --> 1:56:52.920]  all they're doing is doing more testing more fake testing and it turns out the
[1:56:52.920 --> 1:56:56.000]  tester fake and they're using the normal deaths from other things in the
[1:56:56.000 --> 1:57:00.080]  COVID column this has to be called out we have to call it out you have to call
[1:57:00.080 --> 1:57:05.560]  it out this is 21st century warfare this is fifth-generational warfare against
[1:57:05.560 --> 1:57:09.520]  you and your family and we're all under attack our whole future under attack by
[1:57:09.520 --> 1:57:13.120]  a scientific group of very evil people that think you and I and all of us are
[1:57:13.120 --> 1:57:18.520]  too stupid to actually see their public battle plans and do something about it
[1:57:18.520 --> 1:57:24.080]  so again ladies and gentlemen I am begging all of you to realize that this
[1:57:24.080 --> 1:57:26.800]  is make her to break it and they're trying to overthrow America and replace
[1:57:26.800 --> 1:57:31.920]  it with something a thousand times worse than the worst crimes our system has
[1:57:31.920 --> 1:57:35.920]  committed and done the social contracts been broken the globalists are making
[1:57:35.920 --> 1:57:39.000]  their move against you and your family and it's up to you to decide whether you
[1:57:39.000 --> 1:57:41.560]  want to roll over and be an idiot slave or whether you want to cause a new
[1:57:41.560 --> 1:57:46.800]  renaissance to save this civilization there isn't much time please take action
[1:57:46.800 --> 1:57:52.640]  the people of the world have awakened to globalism and so populist movements
[1:57:52.640 --> 1:57:57.120]  are throwing the globalist out of their countries that's why the new world order
[1:57:57.120 --> 1:58:02.000]  is instituting race war and division and telling the people that rebellion is
[1:58:02.000 --> 1:58:06.440]  about overthrowing your local police and government and destroying essential
[1:58:06.440 --> 1:58:12.680]  services this is an attempt to have society collapse and the globalists as
[1:58:12.680 --> 1:58:16.400]  they've done in the third world will come in and pick up the pieces we must
[1:58:16.400 --> 1:58:21.600]  stand against the UN the IMF the World Bank and the EU openly saying the fund
[1:58:21.600 --> 1:58:25.000]  the police the police have a lot of problems we all have a lot of problems
[1:58:25.000 --> 1:58:28.920]  but this is our government and our local tabulari and believe me once the
[1:58:28.920 --> 1:58:33.200]  globalists have overthrown this country they're gonna put in a real police
[1:58:33.200 --> 1:58:36.280]  state where you have no due process or freedom the globalist believe communist
[1:58:36.280 --> 1:58:41.120]  China is the model of the world and they are orchestrating this entire thing the
[1:58:41.120 --> 1:58:45.600]  people helping them are collaborators and are idiots and must be opposed in
[1:58:45.600 --> 1:58:48.880]  full wars dot com
[1:58:53.600 --> 1:58:59.040]  globalists have gotten away with their Russia gate hoax their Ukraine hoax
[1:58:59.040 --> 1:59:08.120]  their COVID-19 hoax and now it's the race riot hoax of 2020 we got to ask
[1:59:08.120 --> 1:59:11.520]  ourselves what's coming next I can tell you it's gonna be a bunch of big old
[1:59:11.520 --> 1:59:16.800]  fat mass shootings to create even a bigger race war it's gonna be economic
[1:59:16.800 --> 1:59:22.200]  collapse China invading Taiwan Hong Kong you name it the globalists are

[1:59:26.960 --> 1:59:31.280]  tried to censor in fours off here because they knew when they launched this
[1:59:31.280 --> 1:59:35.320]  whole situation that they didn't want the people's voice to still be on air but
