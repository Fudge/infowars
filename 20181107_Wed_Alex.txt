[00:00.000 --> 00:29.300]  Well, we're going to look at every angle of this historic collection and what it means
[00:29.300 --> 00:30.300]  in the future.
[00:30.300 --> 00:34.720]  Now, the globalists tried to buy the election and barely got the House, and historically
[00:34.720 --> 00:39.160]  we got a whole bunch of new seats in the Senate, but the fight is about to happen, obviously.
[00:39.160 --> 00:42.720]  The President, literally one minute ago, began speaking.
[00:42.720 --> 00:47.480]  We've got the satellite feed live right now, President Trump talking about this historic
[00:47.480 --> 00:48.480]  midterm election.
[00:48.480 --> 00:49.480]  Let's go to him.
[00:49.480 --> 00:52.440]  In the last 30 years, a sitting President's party has only gained a cumulative total of
[00:52.440 --> 00:58.360]  eight Senate seats, averaging one per decade.
[00:58.360 --> 01:03.200]  So if we picked up two, three, or four, that's a big percentage of that number.
[01:03.200 --> 01:08.560]  So in the last 80 years, you think of that, only eight seats.
[01:08.560 --> 01:15.600]  In President Obama's first midterm election, he lost six Senate seats, including in the
[01:15.600 --> 01:25.000]  deep blue state of Massachusetts, Republicans captured at least four Senate seats held by
[01:25.000 --> 01:34.440]  Democrat incumbents, and these are tremendously talented, hardworking people that did this.
[01:34.440 --> 01:48.040]  Indiana, North Dakota, Florida, Missouri, we also won two open Senate seats in Tennessee.
[01:48.040 --> 01:56.840]  I want to congratulate our great champion who did such a great job in Tennessee, Marsha.
[01:56.840 --> 01:57.840]  This is live.
[01:57.840 --> 01:58.840]  And in Utah.
[01:58.840 --> 02:01.360]  And we're going to air it all later.
[02:01.360 --> 02:04.880]  And Arizona is looking very good, really very good.
[02:04.880 --> 02:07.080]  There's still some races open in California and Arizona.
[02:07.080 --> 02:10.520]  That was a tough race, and she's done a fantastic job.
[02:10.520 --> 02:16.440]  And each of these open seats, Democrats recruited very strong candidates with substantial fundraising
[02:16.440 --> 02:17.920]  and media support.
[02:17.920 --> 02:23.000]  We were getting bombarded with money on the other side.
[02:23.000 --> 02:28.800]  In the House, Republicans dramatically outperformed historical precedents and overcame a historic
[02:28.800 --> 02:31.280]  number of retirements.
[02:31.280 --> 02:38.240]  The most House Republican retirements in 88 years, 43 House Republicans retired.
[02:38.240 --> 02:40.240]  Yeah, that was the sabotage.
[02:40.240 --> 02:45.320]  I was curious that in many cases they were chairman of committees.
[02:45.320 --> 02:46.320]  A lot of them were neocons.
[02:46.320 --> 02:50.200]  They weren't chairman because the Republicans have a rule for six years.
[02:50.200 --> 02:55.600]  And what that does is wonderful in one way, it lets people come through the system and
[02:55.600 --> 02:56.600]  become chairman.
[02:56.600 --> 02:59.840]  And another way, it drives people out because when they're a chairman, they don't want
[02:59.840 --> 03:00.840]  to go and not be a chairman.
[03:00.840 --> 03:02.720]  You can tell it's going to go on for a long time.
[03:02.720 --> 03:03.720]  We're going to go to break.
[03:03.720 --> 03:04.720]  Ted Nugent's going to respond.
[03:04.720 --> 03:06.800]  We come back.
[03:06.800 --> 03:10.640]  This is the big takeaway for me.
[03:10.640 --> 03:17.160]  Two things, allowing illegal cartel level concerted racketeering censorship in the last
[03:17.160 --> 03:25.440]  year accelerating to the election and the House not passing voter ID, as Michael Savage
[03:25.440 --> 03:31.440]  said in the tweet, the rhinos blew their last chance because illegal aliens and folks voting
[03:31.440 --> 03:38.760]  with names of dead people took it over the edge along with the censorship.
[03:38.760 --> 03:41.440]  And now if we don't do something about the censorship, it's going to embolden even more
[03:41.440 --> 03:46.480]  censorship and deplatforming and harassment that's criminal.
[03:46.480 --> 03:50.800]  So now if Trump and the Republican Zone Act decisively, they are aiding and abetting it.
[03:50.800 --> 03:54.360]  The president said he's about to act, and I trust the president, but I'm just saying
[03:54.360 --> 03:57.480]  this is a big deal.
[03:57.480 --> 04:04.200]  And you know, the fact that Ted Cruz only won by like three points in Texas is horrifying.
[04:04.200 --> 04:11.720]  Bado O'Rourke was an establishment Hollywood funded globalist, anti-gun, fat cat, openly
[04:11.720 --> 04:14.680]  halfway funded by Soros, opened the border.
[04:14.680 --> 04:17.600]  So this election's a wake up call.
[04:17.600 --> 04:21.320]  We hold them back on many levels, gained three seats in the Senate.
[04:21.320 --> 04:24.080]  They didn't lose all these governors' races like they said they would.
[04:24.080 --> 04:29.120]  Every candidate establishment got behind, the Democrats lost, whether it was a beta
[04:29.120 --> 04:35.240]  man here in Texas or whether it was Gilligan from Gilligan's Moron Island, they're in
[04:35.240 --> 04:36.240]  Florida.
[04:36.240 --> 04:38.800]  I'm calling Florida Moron Island, I'm saying he's from Moron Island.
[04:38.800 --> 04:42.480]  I know his name's not Gilligan, I like the bunch of their names, because these people
[04:42.480 --> 04:44.640]  have been destroyed, they're has-mits.
[04:44.640 --> 04:50.560]  So we're going to be breaking it all down, Motor City Madman joins us from Michigan straight
[04:50.560 --> 04:52.280]  ahead and I've got everything to lay out.
[04:52.280 --> 04:53.280]  So stay with us.
[04:53.280 --> 05:00.280]  It's the day after and looking forward because we have the key intel.
[05:00.280 --> 05:04.320]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment
[05:04.320 --> 05:09.560]  full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it, that it lowers IQ, it
[05:09.560 --> 05:12.440]  literally dumbs the population down.
[05:12.440 --> 05:16.600]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've
[05:16.600 --> 05:19.360]  gone through two permutations.
[05:19.360 --> 05:23.520]  This seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source and the globalists
[05:23.520 --> 05:28.120]  tried to block us getting a supply of it, so we discovered deep earth crystals, a pure
[05:28.120 --> 05:31.760]  nascent iodine and brought you X2, that's been incredible.
[05:31.760 --> 05:36.680]  Now due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more
[05:36.680 --> 05:41.400]  of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine, but chemists, scientists and others showed
[05:41.400 --> 05:46.400]  us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine
[05:46.400 --> 05:52.800]  and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[05:52.800 --> 05:56.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible
[05:56.000 --> 05:57.000]  discovery.
[05:57.000 --> 06:19.000]  It's X3, now available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[06:19.000 --> 06:23.400]  President Trump is speaking live in the last six, seven minutes, detailing what happened
[06:23.400 --> 06:29.680]  in the election last night, still ongoing in three states on the West Coast and Arizona.
[06:29.680 --> 06:36.000]  So we'll be looking at all of that after Ted Nugent leaves us in about 20 minutes from
[06:36.000 --> 06:37.000]  now.
[06:37.000 --> 06:40.000]  I want to get his take on it because he's out there in the grass roots of Texas and
[06:40.000 --> 06:44.440]  Michigan and many other areas and as he said two years ago, it's going to be the Rust Belt
[06:44.440 --> 06:49.680]  of Pennsylvania and Michigan and places like that that are going to decide the 2020 election
[06:49.680 --> 06:53.720]  and boy, has he been proven right there.
[06:53.720 --> 06:59.520]  We'll be going over all the numbers today and so much more, but not getting voter motor
[06:59.520 --> 07:03.800]  passed in the house, the rhinos really, really blew it as Michael Savage has said and the
[07:03.800 --> 07:09.440]  other big one was the total censorship of conservatives and nationalist patriots of
[07:09.440 --> 07:13.680]  the completely platforming, not even letting people, you know, promote things on Facebook,
[07:13.680 --> 07:14.680]  you name it.
[07:14.680 --> 07:19.200]  That is an in-kind donation to the Democrats and it's a major federal elections commission
[07:19.200 --> 07:20.200]  violation.
[07:20.200 --> 07:26.440]  So the Republicans always sit back with the Democrats, engage in corruption and that becomes
[07:26.440 --> 07:27.440]  aiding and abetting it.
[07:27.440 --> 07:31.760]  Like Beto O'Rourke got caught, the highest levels of his campaign siphoning off money
[07:31.760 --> 07:36.000]  to give to the caravans, caravans that are already arriving, not just the big one.
[07:36.000 --> 07:39.160]  And so we have to fight the violation of free speech.
[07:39.160 --> 07:43.200]  We have to fight the Chinese meddling in the election, which was public.
[07:43.200 --> 07:46.880]  We have to have the Republicans go on the offense against the Democrats, just like the
[07:46.880 --> 07:50.000]  Democrats just did, but we have real meat and potatoes here.
[07:50.000 --> 07:56.800]  That's my view on all this, you know, 20-something seats in the house, three new Senate seats,
[07:56.800 --> 08:01.600]  so it's a trade-off, but they're going to use those committees now, the one that Maxine
[08:01.600 --> 08:06.840]  Waters heads up that deals with the financing of the country to try to sabotage.
[08:06.840 --> 08:11.880]  The Dems have 34 in the house and three in the Senate.
[08:11.880 --> 08:14.360]  And it's a pretty big win for them there.
[08:14.360 --> 08:19.480]  Sometimes you appear trying to spend it that, oh, well Obama lost 60-plus in the house and
[08:19.480 --> 08:20.680]  a whole bunch of senators.
[08:20.680 --> 08:22.480]  Well, yes, that's great.
[08:22.480 --> 08:23.980]  That's a bigger defeat.
[08:23.980 --> 08:28.520]  This could have been a lot worse, but the fact that Trump has had his legs cut out from
[08:28.520 --> 08:32.240]  under him with all the Internet censorship is a big deal.
[08:32.240 --> 08:35.160]  Joining us is Ted Nugent to give us his aftermath take.
[08:35.160 --> 08:38.880]  He privately told me that he was, you know, putting a good face on it, but he had a bad
[08:38.880 --> 08:39.880]  feeling.
[08:39.880 --> 08:43.960]  So did I, but again, I think the illegals and folks voting in dead people's names,
[08:43.960 --> 08:49.760]  which is confirmed everywhere in many places, pushed him over the top, plus a record spending.
[08:49.760 --> 08:51.960]  So Ted, thanks for coming on with us, Mr. Nugent.
[08:51.960 --> 08:53.280]  Well, thanks, Alex.
[08:53.280 --> 08:54.280]  My pleasure.
[08:54.280 --> 09:00.960]  I'm kind of sharing a dynamic rollercoaster ride of emotions here with you today, but it's
[09:00.960 --> 09:03.920]  a happy November 7th to everyone anyway.
[09:03.920 --> 09:07.680]  And I suppose we need to keep our chin up and keep our spirits positive.
[09:07.680 --> 09:12.120]  Today is my son, Theodore Tobias Nugent's 42nd birthday.
[09:12.120 --> 09:16.640]  And we shared a wonderful morning and the sacred Michigan swamps together with some
[09:16.640 --> 09:21.880]  great, great American entrepreneurs working hard, playing hard families during the very
[09:21.880 --> 09:23.640]  important deer season up here.
[09:23.640 --> 09:27.320]  So that's keeping my spirit buoyant and alive.
[09:27.320 --> 09:35.480]  But when I consider the politics of the once greatest, most productive, work ethic pride
[09:35.480 --> 09:45.240]  in excellent state of Michigan turn into a toxic, embarrassing, vulgar, cultural suicide
[09:45.240 --> 09:54.720]  liberal hellhole like California in 2018, and Alex, I could literally cry tears of blood
[09:54.720 --> 10:01.920]  to witness the once great state of Michigan literally look on the chalkboard of suicidal
[10:01.920 --> 10:09.040]  guarantees of California and then vote for them all.
[10:09.040 --> 10:17.720]  I, I hesitate but, but am forced to admit that if Michigan can go from the number one
[10:17.720 --> 10:25.760]  most productive proud state in the nation to a embarrassing suburb of Chicago, suburb
[10:25.760 --> 10:26.760]  of California.
[10:26.760 --> 10:29.640]  I want to fill your thunder so can Texas.
[10:29.640 --> 10:36.000]  Well, thank God I'm a Texas resident, I'll be going home to Texas soon because we prove
[10:36.000 --> 10:43.160]  that the smoke screen and the deceit and the fake news, hate and lies of the left that
[10:43.160 --> 10:50.040]  Robert O'Rourke scammed Texans with was defeated and that a great, great constitutionalist
[10:50.040 --> 10:55.000]  like Ted Cruz defeated this on California wannabe.
[10:55.000 --> 10:57.320]  That is another high for me.
[10:57.320 --> 11:03.480]  But I'm in the swamps of Michigan right now, Alex, and I suppose metaphorically speaking,
[11:03.480 --> 11:09.640]  a lot of my fellow Americans are in the swamps of Michigan right now because when you adhere
[11:09.640 --> 11:15.080]  to the agenda of the left where you don't even have to be an American to vote in America,
[11:15.080 --> 11:20.880]  where you don't believe that America should have secure borders, where you know that gun-free
[11:20.880 --> 11:28.600]  zones are where the most innocent lives are slaughtered and these freaks want more of them.
[11:28.600 --> 11:35.200]  This is planet of the cuckoo's necks, click cake, clockwork, orange, twilight zone, insanity,
[11:35.200 --> 11:37.160]  and I don't recognize these people.
[11:37.160 --> 11:42.400]  I don't recognize them as thinking conscientious moral beings.
[11:42.400 --> 11:44.600]  Well, Ted, that's my next question.
[11:44.600 --> 11:49.320]  That's my next question because you look at Michigan, which I've had family that lived
[11:49.320 --> 11:53.040]  up there in the 50s, 60s, you name it, I know all about it, you know, vacationed up there,
[11:53.040 --> 11:55.160]  the Great Lakes, all of it's beautiful.
[11:55.160 --> 12:04.240]  It was as American red-blooded kick-ass John Wayne, Chuck Yeager as Texas was, and then
[12:04.240 --> 12:10.000]  it got taken over, just like Vermont was, and now it is the bluest of the blue cesspool.
[12:10.000 --> 12:14.440]  So when I look at Michigan and how sad it is and how it's been destroyed in many areas,
[12:14.440 --> 12:18.480]  it still has this great beauty, a lot of great people in the country, I'm saying Texas only
[12:18.480 --> 12:24.840]  put amazing Ted Cruz, perfect for Texas, total constitutionalist patriot, only beating by
[12:24.840 --> 12:25.920]  three points.
[12:25.920 --> 12:29.240]  That to me is frightening, and that's why the New York Times brags that they think
[12:29.240 --> 12:34.040]  in the next decade, if we don't do something, we're going to go the way of California and
[12:34.040 --> 12:37.160]  then the way of Michigan, and so how do we reverse this nightmare?
[12:37.160 --> 12:39.320]  How do we get on the offense?
[12:39.320 --> 12:41.040]  You know, Alex, I always have answers.
[12:41.040 --> 12:44.920]  If you notice that whenever you and I have a dialogue and an interview, I've always got
[12:44.920 --> 12:45.920]  answers, don't I?
[12:45.920 --> 12:46.920]  Yes.
[12:46.920 --> 12:50.760]  I'm an eternal and maniacal optimist.
[12:50.760 --> 12:54.840]  I believe in the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the Declaration of Independence.
[12:54.840 --> 12:56.840]  I believe in the Ten Commandments of the Golden Rule.
[12:56.840 --> 13:00.360]  I believe in loving your neighbor and helping your family and neighbor and being in the
[13:00.360 --> 13:04.920]  asset column and making sacrifices and taking risks so that you are a productive member
[13:04.920 --> 13:08.680]  of your community so that you can help others when they need it.
[13:08.680 --> 13:13.080]  And I know these people, I know they're everywhere, but guess what?
[13:13.080 --> 13:15.080]  We're outnumbered.
[13:15.080 --> 13:20.880]  The people who believe that we should turn Michigan into a San Francisco feces and needle
[13:20.880 --> 13:31.600]  zone outnumber conscientious, positive, constitutional, free, Michiganiacs.
[13:31.600 --> 13:35.800]  I'm helpless to describe why or how.
[13:35.800 --> 13:41.120]  I worked so hard for the great John James and the Bill Shuddy and the Tom Leonard and
[13:41.120 --> 13:42.360]  the Lena Epstein.
[13:42.360 --> 13:48.280]  I worked so hard for these Republicans who's battle cry was the Constitution and rugged
[13:48.280 --> 13:53.440]  individualism and productivity and work ethic and living within your means and saving for
[13:53.440 --> 13:54.440]  a rainy day.
[13:54.440 --> 13:58.360]  And Alex, it was rejected.
[13:58.360 --> 14:00.360]  I am heart broke.
[14:00.360 --> 14:04.280]  Alex, I'm going to admit, my name is Ted Nugent.
[14:04.280 --> 14:09.560]  I don't know what else to do.
[14:09.560 --> 14:15.200]  I'm in that position as well, but I tell you what, we need more people to do what you're
[14:15.200 --> 14:16.200]  doing.
[14:16.200 --> 14:21.760]  What I've done, what Ted, what Trump is doing is get really aggressive and not let these
[14:21.760 --> 14:26.800]  people push us around and understand that they're like cancer and have to be dealt with
[14:26.800 --> 14:31.200]  and do outreach, try to take leftist out and deprogram them, try to take them, shoot them,
[14:31.200 --> 14:32.360]  try to take them camping.
[14:32.360 --> 14:36.400]  I think if you really look at the average leftist, they're super domesticated.
[14:36.400 --> 14:37.640]  They're scared.
[14:37.640 --> 14:42.200]  They don't know what's going on, and then they're controlled by a criminal elite themselves
[14:42.200 --> 14:45.640]  who usually don't even pay taxes, but lecture those of us that do that we're not paying
[14:45.640 --> 14:46.640]  enough.
[14:46.640 --> 14:50.840]  I really think we have to go to political war against them because we just live our lives
[14:50.840 --> 14:52.760]  and then come out every two years and vote.
[14:52.760 --> 14:54.240]  We're going to have to go on the offense.
[14:54.240 --> 15:00.720]  Well, Alex, as I just expressed an uninhibited, honest, and genuine, sincere statement of
[15:00.720 --> 15:03.440]  hopelessness, let me take the next step.
[15:03.440 --> 15:05.680]  And I know you're ready for this.
[15:05.680 --> 15:12.960]  As I told my once great friend Anthony Bourdain on his show when he asked me what was going
[15:12.960 --> 15:19.120]  to happen if Obama got elected again in 2012, I firmed up my grip and I said, I'm going
[15:19.120 --> 15:20.120]  to work harder.
[15:20.120 --> 15:21.120]  I'm going to try harder.
[15:21.120 --> 15:22.120]  I'm going to fight harder.
[15:22.120 --> 15:24.120]  I'm going to raise more hell.
[15:24.120 --> 15:29.200]  I'm going to make sure that I put more constitutional pressure on every one of my elected officials.
[15:29.200 --> 15:32.680]  So as I say, I don't know what to do.
[15:32.680 --> 15:37.360]  I'm going to continue the same thing I've always done, being American, being a patriot,
[15:37.360 --> 15:42.560]  being a productive American family, conscientious God, family, your hands are right, but I'm
[15:42.560 --> 15:44.040]  going to turn up the heat.
[15:44.040 --> 15:45.480]  And Ted, you do know what to do.
[15:45.480 --> 15:47.800]  You've been leading this thing since the 1960s.
[15:47.800 --> 15:49.400]  That's why it's so great to have you on.
[15:49.400 --> 15:53.400]  One more segment as we look at the aftermath of the still ongoing election, but we come
[15:53.400 --> 15:54.400]  back.
[15:54.400 --> 15:59.240]  His new record comes out in two days.
[15:59.240 --> 16:04.600]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of
[16:04.600 --> 16:05.600]  the world.
[16:05.600 --> 16:08.640]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[16:08.640 --> 16:14.600]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[16:14.600 --> 16:18.400]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[16:18.400 --> 16:19.400]  Was there ever a vote?
[16:19.400 --> 16:20.960]  Who do we fight for?
[16:20.960 --> 16:27.520]  The deep state began with World War I, the United States of Empire, by James Dunne, available
[16:27.520 --> 16:29.520]  at Amazon Books.
[16:58.520 --> 17:02.920]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook
[17:02.920 --> 17:04.080]  food and boil water.
[17:04.080 --> 17:08.760]  If your current plan includes using a fuel-burning stove or cooking over an open fire, then there's
[17:08.760 --> 17:09.960]  a much better way.
[17:09.960 --> 17:14.800]  The Minuteman Rocket Stove is a biomass-burning cooking stove that only requires small quantities
[17:14.800 --> 17:16.440]  of sticks and twigs for fuel.
[17:16.440 --> 17:20.520]  The Minuteman Stove is easy to use, smokeless, portable, powerful, and sustainable.
[17:20.520 --> 17:25.080]  For the finest in survival cooking stoves and fire starters made right here in the USA,
[17:25.080 --> 17:28.760]  go to MinutemanStove.com, that's MinutemanStove.com.
[17:28.760 --> 17:30.760]  Hear that?
[17:30.760 --> 17:36.160]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked the place.
[17:36.160 --> 17:39.200]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[17:39.200 --> 17:42.680]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.
[17:42.680 --> 17:47.960]  Go to faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching
[17:47.960 --> 17:50.640]  TV, even when you're miles away.
[17:50.640 --> 17:54.840]  Security is a mindset, and fake TV should be part of your security solution.
[17:54.840 --> 17:57.360]  Be vigilant, but not fearful.
[17:57.360 --> 18:26.840]  FakeTV.com
[18:26.840 --> 18:31.600]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the
[18:31.600 --> 18:36.840]  fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress
[18:36.840 --> 18:37.840]  symptoms.
[18:37.840 --> 18:40.520]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[18:40.520 --> 18:41.520]  It is not an antihistamine.
[18:41.520 --> 18:46.440]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of
[18:46.440 --> 18:52.240]  triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[18:52.240 --> 18:54.960]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[18:54.960 --> 19:01.320]  Visit infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[19:01.320 --> 19:06.080]  Alex Jones here with an extremely exciting announcement that will be a gift to yourself
