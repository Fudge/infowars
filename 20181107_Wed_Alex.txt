[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.683]  Big Brother.
[00:00:09.683 --> 00:00:12.466]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:15.049]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:16.811]  You want answers?
[00:00:16.811 --> 00:00:18.874]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:18.874 --> 00:00:25.181]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.103]  Well, we're going to look at every angle of this historic election and what it means into the future.
[00:00:30.103 --> 00:00:34.066]  Now, the globalists tried to buy the election and barely got the House.
[00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:36.648]  And historically, we got a whole bunch of new seats in the Senate.
[00:00:36.648 --> 00:00:39.130]  But the fight is about to happen, obviously.
[00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.673]  The president literally, one minute ago, began speaking.
[00:00:42.673 --> 00:00:48.217]  We've got the satellite feed live right now, President Trump talking about this historic midterm election.
[00:00:48.217 --> 00:00:48.697]  Let's go to him.
[00:00:48.697 --> 00:00:53.982]  In 30 years, a sitting president's party has only gained a cumulative total of eight Senate seats.
[00:00:55.313 --> 00:00:58.295]  Averaging one per decade.
[00:00:58.295 --> 00:01:03.117]  So if we picked up two, three, or four, that's a big percentage of that number.
[00:01:03.117 --> 00:01:08.500]  So in the last 80 years, you think of that, only eight seats.
[00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:18.725]  In President Obama's first midterm election, he lost six Senate seats, including in the deep blue state of Massachusetts.
[00:01:19.736 --> 00:01:28.379]  Republicans captured at least four Senate seats held by Democrat incumbents.
[00:01:28.379 --> 00:01:34.041]  And these are tremendously talented, hardworking people that did this.
[00:01:34.041 --> 00:01:42.883]  Indiana, North Dakota, Florida, Missouri.
[00:01:42.883 --> 00:01:46.885]  We also won two open Senate seats in Tennessee,
[00:01:48.129 --> 00:01:56.733]  I want to congratulate our great champion who did such a great job in Tennessee, Marsha.
[00:01:56.733 --> 00:01:57.553]  This is live.
[00:01:57.553 --> 00:01:58.874]  And in Utah.
[00:01:58.874 --> 00:02:01.155]  And we're going to air it all later.
[00:02:01.155 --> 00:02:03.116]  And Arizona is looking very good.
[00:02:04.213 --> 00:02:04.954]  Really very good.
[00:02:04.954 --> 00:02:06.995]  There's still some races open in California and Arizona.
[00:02:06.995 --> 00:02:10.457]  That was a tough race and she's done a fantastic job.
[00:02:10.457 --> 00:02:17.881]  In each of these open seats, Democrats recruited very strong candidates with substantial fundraising and media support.
[00:02:17.881 --> 00:02:21.603]  We were getting bombarded with money on the other side.
[00:02:22.955 --> 00:02:31.239]  In the House, Republicans dramatically outperformed historical precedents and overcame a historic number of retirements.
[00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:38.962]  The most House Republican retirements in 88 years, 43 House Republicans retired.
[00:02:38.962 --> 00:02:39.763]  Yeah, that was the sabotage.
[00:02:39.763 --> 00:02:44.565]  I will say this, that in many cases they were chairman of committees.
[00:02:44.565 --> 00:02:46.466]  A lot of them were neocons.
[00:02:46.466 --> 00:02:49.327]  They weren't chairman because the Republicans have a rule for six years.
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.721]  And what that does is wonderful in one way.
[00:02:52.721 --> 00:02:56.403]  It lets people come through the system and become chairman.
[00:02:56.403 --> 00:02:58.464]  In another way, it drives people out.
[00:02:58.464 --> 00:03:01.005]  Because when they're a chairman, they don't want to go and not be a chairman.
[00:03:01.005 --> 00:03:02.726]  You can tell it's going to go on for a long time.
[00:03:02.726 --> 00:03:03.446]  We're going to go to break.
[00:03:03.446 --> 00:03:04.707]  Ted Nugent's going to respond.
[00:03:04.707 --> 00:03:06.687]  We come back.
[00:03:06.687 --> 00:03:10.609]  This is the big takeaway for me.
[00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:11.770]  Two things.
[00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:18.693]  Allowing illegal cartel level concerted racketeering censorship in the last year accelerated to the election.
[00:03:20.843 --> 00:03:29.652]  And the House not passing voter ID, as Michael Savage said in a tweet, the RINOs blew their last chance.
[00:03:29.652 --> 00:03:38.620]  Because illegal aliens and folks voting the names of dead people took it over the edge, along with the censorship.
[00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:45.047]  And now if we don't do something about the censorship, it's going to embolden even more censorship and deplatforming and harassment that's criminal.
[00:03:46.414 --> 00:03:50.757]  So now if Trump and the Republicans don't act decisively, they are aiding and abetting it.
[00:03:50.757 --> 00:03:57.301]  The President said he's about to act, and I trust the President, but I'm just saying, this is a big deal.
[00:03:57.301 --> 00:04:04.146]  And, you know, the fact that Ted Cruz only won by like three points in Texas is horrifying.
[00:04:04.146 --> 00:04:04.987]  Beto O'Rourke
[00:04:06.018 --> 00:04:14.605]  was an establishment, Hollywood-funded, globalist, anti-gun, fat cat, openly halfway funded by Soros, opening the border.
[00:04:14.605 --> 00:04:17.568]  So, this election's a wake-up call.
[00:04:17.568 --> 00:04:21.271]  He held them back on many levels, gained three seats in the Senate.
[00:04:21.271 --> 00:04:23.953]  They didn't lose all these governor's races like they said they would.
[00:04:23.953 --> 00:04:27.216]  Every candidate the establishment got behind, the Democrats lost.
[00:04:27.216 --> 00:04:27.636]  Whether it was
[00:04:28.922 --> 00:04:34.923]  Beta Man here in Texas or whether it was Gilligan from Gilligan's Moron Island.
[00:04:34.923 --> 00:04:35.504]  They're in Florida.
[00:04:35.504 --> 00:04:37.564]  I'm calling Florida Moron Island.
[00:04:37.564 --> 00:04:39.125]  I'm saying he's from Moron Island.
[00:04:39.125 --> 00:04:40.445]  I know his name's not Gilligan.
[00:04:40.445 --> 00:04:41.965]  I liked a bunch of their names.
[00:04:41.965 --> 00:04:43.986]  These people have been destroyed.
[00:04:43.986 --> 00:04:44.566]  There has been.
[00:04:44.566 --> 00:04:48.027]  So we're gonna be breaking it all down.
[00:04:48.027 --> 00:04:50.367]  Motor City Madman joins us from Michigan.
[00:04:50.367 --> 00:04:53.348]  Straight ahead and I've got everything to lay out so stay with us.
[00:04:53.348 --> 00:04:56.829]  It's the day after and looking forward because we have the key intel.
[00:05:00.256 --> 00:05:09.546]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[00:05:09.546 --> 00:05:12.429]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[00:05:12.429 --> 00:05:18.456]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best eye out of the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[00:05:19.136 --> 00:05:25.381]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good, but hard to source, and the Globals tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[00:05:25.381 --> 00:05:31.685]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[00:05:31.685 --> 00:05:38.610]  Now, due to the Establisher trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[00:05:39.751 --> 00:05:52.781]  Chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[00:05:52.781 --> 00:05:57.024]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[00:05:57.024 --> 00:05:59.726]  X3, now available at m4slife.com.
[00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:07.213]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:06:07.213 --> 00:06:08.895]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:06:08.895 --> 00:06:10.556]  Well, so does he.
[00:06:10.556 --> 00:06:15.240]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:18.704 --> 00:06:30.174]  President Trump is speaking live in the last six, seven minutes, detailing what happened in the election last night, still ongoing in three states, on the west coast in Arizona.
[00:06:30.174 --> 00:06:34.137]  So we'll be looking at all of that after Ted Nugent leaves us in about
[00:06:34.978 --> 00:06:53.635]  Twenty minutes from now I want to get his take on it because he's out there in the grassroots in Texas and Michigan and many other areas and as he said two years ago it's gonna be the Rust Belt of Pennsylvania and Michigan and places like that that are gonna decide the 2020 election and boy has he been proven right there.
[00:06:53.635 --> 00:06:57.138]  We'll be going over all the numbers today and so much more but
[00:06:57.999 --> 00:07:00.580]  Not getting voter motor passed in the House.
[00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:03.180]  The RINOs really, really blew it, as Michael Savage has said.
[00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:09.422]  And the other big one was the total censorship of conservatives, nationalists, patriots.
[00:07:09.422 --> 00:07:14.583]  The complete de-platforming, not even letting people, you know, promote things on Facebook, you name it.
[00:07:14.583 --> 00:07:16.843]  That is an in-kind donation to the Democrats.
[00:07:16.843 --> 00:07:19.844]  And it's a major Federal Elections Commission violation.
[00:07:19.844 --> 00:07:24.105]  So, the Republicans always sit back while the Democrats engage in corruption.
[00:07:25.612 --> 00:07:33.536]  And that becomes aiding and abetting, like Beto O'Rourke got caught at the highest levels of his campaign siphoning off money to give to the caravan.
[00:07:33.536 --> 00:07:35.917]  Caravans were already arriving, not just the big one.
[00:07:35.917 --> 00:07:39.099]  And so we have to fight the violation of free speech.
[00:07:39.099 --> 00:07:43.141]  We have to fight the Chinese meddling in the election, which was public.
[00:07:43.141 --> 00:07:48.403]  We have to have the Republicans go on the offense against the Democrats, just like the Democrats just did.
[00:07:48.403 --> 00:07:49.824]  But we have real meat and potatoes here.
[00:07:49.824 --> 00:07:50.705]  That's my view.
[00:07:51.795 --> 00:07:52.876]  on all this.
[00:07:52.876 --> 00:07:56.757]  You know, 20-something seats in the House, three new Senate seats.
[00:07:56.757 --> 00:08:07.862]  So it's a trade-off, but they're going to use those committees now, the one that Maxine Waters heads up that deals with the financing of the country, to try to sabotage the Dems.
[00:08:07.862 --> 00:08:11.764]  They have 34 in the House and three in the Senate.
[00:08:11.764 --> 00:08:14.265]  And it's a pretty big win for them there.
[00:08:14.265 --> 00:08:18.067]  Some GOP are trying to spin it that, oh, well, Obama lost 60-plus in the House.
[00:08:19.395 --> 00:08:20.536]  And a whole bunch of senators.
[00:08:20.536 --> 00:08:22.317]  Well, yes, that's great.
[00:08:22.317 --> 00:08:23.878]  That's a bigger defeat.
[00:08:23.878 --> 00:08:31.982]  This could have been a lot worse, but the fact that Trump has had his legs cut out from under him with all the internet censorship is a big deal.
[00:08:31.982 --> 00:08:35.164]  Joining us is Ted Nugent to give us his aftermath take.
[00:08:35.164 --> 00:08:35.985]  He privately told me.
[00:08:36.525 --> 00:08:39.548]  That he was, you know, putting a good face on it, but he had a bad feeling.
[00:08:39.548 --> 00:08:47.336]  So did I. But again, I think the illegals and folks voting in dead people's names, which is confirmed everywhere in many places, pushed him over the top.
[00:08:47.336 --> 00:08:49.718]  Plus a record spending.
[00:08:49.718 --> 00:08:51.580]  So, Ted, thanks for coming on with us, Mr. Nugent.
[00:08:52.438 --> 00:08:53.259]  Well, thanks, Alex.
[00:08:53.259 --> 00:08:53.919]  My pleasure.
[00:08:53.919 --> 00:09:08.048]  I'm kind of sharing a dynamic rollercoaster ride of emotions here with you today, but it's a happy November 7th to everyone anyway, and I suppose we need to keep our chin up and keep our spirit positive.
[00:09:08.048 --> 00:09:20.636]  Today is my son Theodore Tobias Nugent's 42nd birthday, and we shared a wonderful morning in the sacred Michigan swamps together with some great, great American entrepreneurs, working hard, playing hard families during the
[00:09:21.136 --> 00:09:48.969]  There's a very important deer season up here, so that's keeping my spirit buoyant and alive, but when I consider the politics of the once greatest, most productive, work ethic, pride in excellence state of Michigan turn into a toxic, embarrassing, vulgar, cultural suicide liberal hellhole like California in 2018,
[00:09:50.797 --> 00:10:09.431]  And Alex, I could literally cry tears of blood to witness the once great state of Michigan literally look on the chalkboard of suicidal guarantees of California and then vote for them all.
[00:10:09.431 --> 00:10:20.340]  I hesitate but am forced to admit that if Michigan can go from the number one most productive, proud state in the nation
[00:10:21.573 --> 00:10:26.577]  To an embarrassing suburb of Chicago, suburb of California.
[00:10:26.577 --> 00:10:29.880]  I'm gonna fill your thunder, so can Texas.
[00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:34.864]  Well, thank God I'm a Texas resident and I'll be going home to Texas soon.
[00:10:34.864 --> 00:10:51.057]  Because we proved that the smokescreen and the deceit and the fake news, hate and lies of the left that Robert O'Rourke scammed Texas with was defeated and that a great, great constitutionalist like Ted Cruz
[00:10:51.939 --> 00:10:54.832]  I defeated this California wannabe.
[00:10:54.832 --> 00:10:56.479]  That is another high for me.
[00:10:57.185 --> 00:11:26.395]  But I'm in the swamps of Michigan right now, Alex, and I suppose, metaphorically speaking, a lot of my fellow Americans are in the swamps of Michigan right now, because when you adhere to the agenda of the left, where you don't even have to be an American to vote in America, where you don't believe that America should have secure borders, where you know that gun-free zones are where the most innocent lives are slaughtered, and these freaks want more of them!
[00:11:28.466 --> 00:11:30.948]  This is Planet of the Cuckoos next.
[00:11:30.948 --> 00:11:37.271]  Take Clockwork Orange, Twilight Zone, Insanity, and I don't recognize these people.
[00:11:37.271 --> 00:11:42.433]  I don't recognize them as thinking, conscientious, moral beings.
[00:11:44.494 --> 00:11:51.357]  That's my next question, because you look at Michigan, which I've had family that lived up there in the 50s, 60s, you name it.
[00:11:51.357 --> 00:11:52.158]  I know all about it.
[00:11:52.158 --> 00:11:55.119]  You know, vacation up there, the Great Lakes, all of it's beautiful.
[00:11:55.119 --> 00:12:09.946]  It was as American, red-blooded, kick-ass, John Wayne, Chuck Yeager, as Texas was, and then it got taken over, just like Vermont was, and now it is the bluest of the blue, Chesapeake.
[00:12:09.946 --> 00:12:12.287]  So when I look at Michigan and how sad it is,
[00:12:12.867 --> 00:12:14.467]  And how it's been destroyed in many areas.
[00:12:14.467 --> 00:12:16.628]  Still has its great beauty and a lot of great people in the country.
[00:12:16.628 --> 00:12:25.689]  I'm saying Texas only put amazing Ted Cruz, perfect for Texas, total constitutionalist patriot, only beating by three points.
[00:12:25.689 --> 00:12:27.370]  That to me is frightening.
[00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:28.830]  And that's what the New York Times brags.
[00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:34.991]  They think in the next decade, if we don't do something, we're going to go the way of California and in the way of Michigan.
[00:12:34.991 --> 00:12:37.092]  And so how do we reverse this nightmare?
[00:12:37.092 --> 00:12:38.172]  How do we get on the offense?
[00:12:39.229 --> 00:12:40.969]  You know, Alex, I always have answers.
[00:12:40.969 --> 00:12:45.910]  If you notice that whenever you and I have a dialogue or an interview, I've always got answers, don't I?
[00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:46.910]  Yes.
[00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:50.851]  I mean, I'm an eternal, maniacal optimist.
[00:12:50.851 --> 00:12:54.852]  I believe in the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the Declaration of Independence.
[00:12:54.852 --> 00:12:56.892]  I believe in the Ten Commandments of the Golden Rule.
[00:12:56.892 --> 00:13:07.874]  I believe in loving your neighbor and helping your family and neighbor and being in the Asset Column and making sacrifices and taking risks so that you are a productive member of your community so that you can help others when they need it.
[00:13:08.514 --> 00:13:12.957]  And I know these people, I know they're everywhere, but guess what?
[00:13:12.957 --> 00:13:15.018]  We're outnumbered.
[00:13:15.018 --> 00:13:31.747]  The people who believe that we should turn Michigan into a San Francisco feces and needle zone outnumber conscientious, positive, constitutional, free Michiganiacs.
[00:13:31.747 --> 00:13:32.808]  I'm helpless.
[00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:36.061]  To describe why or how.
[00:13:36.061 --> 00:13:42.582]  I worked so hard for the great John James and the Bill Schuette and the Tom Leonard and the Lena Epstein.
[00:13:42.582 --> 00:13:54.546]  I worked so hard for these Republicans who's battle cry was the Constitution and rugged individualism and productivity and work ethic and living within your means and saving for a rainy day.
[00:13:54.546 --> 00:13:58.547]  And Alex, it was rejected.
[00:13:58.547 --> 00:13:58.867]  I am
[00:13:59.842 --> 00:14:04.807]  Alex, I'm gonna admit, my name is Ted Nugent.
[00:14:04.807 --> 00:14:08.311]  I don't know what else to do!
[00:14:12.149 --> 00:14:32.129]  I'm in that position as well, but I tell you what, we need more people to do what you're doing, what I've done, what Trump is doing, is get really aggressive and not let these people push us around and understand that they're like cancer and have to be dealt with and do outreach, try to take leftists out and deprogram them, try to take them, shoot them, try to take them camping.
[00:14:32.449 --> 00:14:46.180]  I think if you really look at the average leftist, they're super domesticated, they're scared, they don't know what's going on, and then they're controlled by a criminal elite themselves who usually don't even pay taxes but lecture those of us that do that we're not paying enough.
[00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:52.665]  I really think we have to go to political war against them because we just live our lives and then come out every two years and vote.
[00:14:52.665 --> 00:14:53.946]  We're going to have to go on the offense.
[00:14:54.682 --> 00:15:03.789]  Well, Alex, as I just expressed an uninhibited, honest, and genuine, sincere statement of hopelessness, let me take the next step.
[00:15:03.789 --> 00:15:05.651]  And I know you're ready for this.
[00:15:05.651 --> 00:15:07.332]  As I told my once great friend,
[00:15:10.454 --> 00:15:16.281]  Anthony Bourdain on his show when he asked me what was going to happen if Obama got elected again in 2012.
[00:15:16.281 --> 00:15:20.166]  I firmed up my grip and I said I'm going to work harder.
[00:15:20.166 --> 00:15:21.408]  I'm going to try harder.
[00:15:21.408 --> 00:15:22.749]  I'm going to fight harder.
[00:15:22.749 --> 00:15:24.351]  I'm going to raise more hell.
[00:15:24.351 --> 00:15:28.316]  I'm going to make sure that I put more constitutional pressure on every one of my
[00:15:28.336 --> 00:15:29.877]  Ted, you're absolutely right.
[00:15:29.877 --> 00:15:32.098]  And Ted, you do know what to do.
[00:15:32.098 --> 00:15:34.959]  You've been leading this thing since the 1960s.
[00:15:34.959 --> 00:15:36.800]  That's why it's so great to have you on.
[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:41.502]  One more segment as we look at the aftermath of the still ongoing election, but we come back.
[00:15:41.502 --> 00:15:43.623]  His new record comes out in two days.
[00:15:59.198 --> 00:16:05.542]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[00:16:05.542 --> 00:16:08.584]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[00:16:08.584 --> 00:16:14.507]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[00:16:14.507 --> 00:16:18.310]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:19.570]  Was there ever a vote?
[00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:20.911]  Who do we fight for?
[00:16:20.911 --> 00:16:27.115]  The deep state began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[00:16:27.115 --> 00:16:28.556]  Available at Amazon Books.
[00:16:29.289 --> 00:16:32.912]  What if there was a social media network only for the conservative?
[00:16:32.912 --> 00:16:40.277]  What if there was a social media network not only for the conservative right general public, but also a platform for conservative politicians and advertisers?
[00:16:40.277 --> 00:16:45.181]  And what if this social media network was the only free speech network in existence?
[00:16:45.181 --> 00:16:46.001]  There is.
[00:16:46.001 --> 00:16:47.623]  It's RightSocial.net.
[00:16:47.623 --> 00:16:48.944]  RightSocial.net.
[00:16:48.944 --> 00:16:52.286]  A response to President Donald Trump's direct presidential order.
[00:16:52.286 --> 00:16:53.587]  RightSocial.net.
[00:16:53.587 --> 00:16:55.789]  Where you have the right to freely speak your mind.
[00:16:55.789 --> 00:16:57.150]  RightSocial.net.
[00:16:57.150 --> 00:16:58.411]  The right place to be.
[00:16:59.275 --> 00:17:04.079]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook food and boil water.
[00:17:04.079 --> 00:17:09.943]  If your current plan includes using a fuel-burning stove or cooking over an open fire, then there's a much better way.
[00:17:09.943 --> 00:17:16.468]  The Minuteman Rocket Stove is a biomass-burning cooking stove that only requires small quantities of sticks and twigs for fuel.
[00:17:16.468 --> 00:17:20.511]  The Minuteman Stove is easy to use, smokeless, portable, powerful, and sustainable.
[00:17:20.511 --> 00:17:26.755]  For the finest in survival cooking stoves and fire starters made right here in the USA, go to MinutemanStove.com.
[00:17:26.755 --> 00:17:28.517]  That's MinutemanStove.com.
[00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:30.781]  Hear that?
[00:17:30.781 --> 00:17:36.165]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[00:17:36.165 --> 00:17:39.068]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[00:17:39.068 --> 00:17:42.650]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.
[00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:50.216]  Go to Faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching TV, even when you're miles away.
[00:17:50.216 --> 00:17:54.820]  Security is a mindset, and Faketv should be part of your security solution.
[00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:57.262]  Be vigilant, but not fearful.
[00:17:57.262 --> 00:17:58.423]  Faketv.com
[00:18:00.188 --> 00:18:03.792]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[00:18:03.792 --> 00:18:05.574]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[00:18:05.574 --> 00:18:17.626]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[00:18:17.626 --> 00:18:22.652]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs,
[00:18:23.092 --> 00:18:23.532]  Let's do it!
[00:18:40.464 --> 00:18:42.185]  It is not an antihistamine.
[00:18:42.185 --> 00:18:52.194]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[00:18:52.194 --> 00:18:54.836]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[00:18:54.836 --> 00:18:59.540]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.

[00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:21.798]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:21.798 --> 00:20:26.423]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:28.049 --> 00:20:31.892]  No Trump, no wall, no USA at all!
[00:20:31.892 --> 00:20:35.756]  No Trump, no wall, no USA at all!
[00:20:35.756 --> 00:20:39.379]  No Trump, no wall, no USA at all!
[00:20:39.379 --> 00:20:41.701]  No Trump, no wall, no USA at all!
[00:20:48.235 --> 00:20:51.517]  So it's a long way to the top if you want to keep this country free.
[00:20:51.517 --> 00:20:56.720]  And that's why I love Ted Nugent, especially getting to meet him in person and spend some time with him a few times over the years.
[00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:58.261]  You can feel the energy.
[00:20:58.261 --> 00:21:00.383]  You can feel the spirit.
[00:21:00.383 --> 00:21:02.144]  And it's the spirit of America.
[00:21:02.144 --> 00:21:08.748]  And he talks about how he sees that around the country and black people and Hispanics and white folks and old people, young people, people that love freedom.
[00:21:08.748 --> 00:21:13.211]  And they get that there is an attempt to domesticate us and control us.
[00:21:13.931 --> 00:21:16.934]  And that there is an attempt to conquer this country.
[00:21:16.934 --> 00:21:23.361]  And that's why you can hear it in his voice, that he's so concerned about what happened last night, not spinning it like some Republicans.
[00:21:23.361 --> 00:21:24.982]  And that's okay, I get it.
[00:21:24.982 --> 00:21:28.106]  Okay, it's the smallest losses ever in a midterm since 1868.
[00:21:28.106 --> 00:21:29.707]  2010, Obama lost 63 in the House.
[00:21:29.707 --> 00:21:30.248]  Clinton in 94, 52.
[00:21:30.248 --> 00:21:31.069]  Eisenhower in 58.
[00:21:36.454 --> 00:21:39.496]  Well, the fact is we're promoting freedom.
[00:21:59.073 --> 00:21:59.854]  We're good to go.
[00:22:15.353 --> 00:22:27.163]  They're either total idiot followers, domesticated, never been out of their condo apartment, God love them, or they're a bunch of scumbag, ultra-rich, controlling people and they have a manager class that literally hate this country.
[00:22:27.163 --> 00:22:28.945]  Ted Nugent, what do we do about them?
[00:22:28.945 --> 00:22:32.848]  You just heard that chant, no borders, no walls, no USA at all.
[00:22:32.848 --> 00:22:39.894]  I say literally, you are against the country existing, that isn't free speech, get your ass out of here, you're a damn enemy.
[00:22:40.902 --> 00:22:48.212]  Well, let me see if I can take a deep breath here after getting the wind knocked out of me in the once great state of Michigan.
[00:22:48.212 --> 00:22:57.644]  But assuming the talking heads were right, that the number one issue for the Democrats was health care, which is liberal code to mean free health care for at least some people of their choosing.
[00:22:58.224 --> 00:23:07.070]  There were other Democrats who championed free college, and other Democrats championed, I guess, free everything, including my dog, Kennel Scooper.
[00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:17.898]  Have you ever noticed that it's the Democrats who want to give away free stuff to everyone who will vote for them, as if there's an endless pile of taxpayer dollars from which to plunder?
[00:23:17.898 --> 00:23:24.122]  Does the Democrats' free stuff mantra make you think back to when your parents told you that nothing is free?
[00:23:25.303 --> 00:23:28.566]  Do you wonder how and who is going to pay for all this free stuff?
[00:23:28.566 --> 00:23:33.071]  Should Starbucks be forced to provide a free cup of coffee every morning to those who don't have any money?
[00:23:33.071 --> 00:23:34.612]  How about restaurants?
[00:23:34.612 --> 00:23:39.056]  Should they be forced to provide free meals to anybody that doesn't want to pay?
[00:23:39.056 --> 00:23:45.102]  I just want to know when the fedzilla gravy train of waste and torch tax dollars ends.
[00:23:45.602 --> 00:23:48.003]  And personal responsibility begins.
[00:23:48.003 --> 00:23:55.365]  Remember that the government that is big enough to give you everything is the government that is big enough to take away everything that you have.
[00:23:55.365 --> 00:24:00.707]  And that's what the zombies and the brainwashed propaganda ministry left.
[00:24:00.707 --> 00:24:02.467]  Zombies don't get.
[00:24:02.467 --> 00:24:12.790]  So those of us that do know that rugged individualism is the foundation of the American dream of independence and being the best that you can be, we better raise
[00:24:12.810 --> 00:24:13.930]  Raise more hell.
[00:24:13.930 --> 00:24:19.452]  We better get more Republicans in our families, in our workforce, in churches, in school, in the deer camp.
[00:24:19.452 --> 00:24:24.853]  We better start raising more hell than we have before because we didn't raise enough hell this time.
[00:24:24.853 --> 00:24:26.273]  And I know a lot of them were close.
[00:24:26.273 --> 00:24:27.674]  And I know we got back.
[00:24:27.674 --> 00:24:28.994]  We got back Florida.
[00:24:28.994 --> 00:24:30.735]  We got a couple of victories here.
[00:24:30.735 --> 00:24:32.495]  But that's not good enough for me.
[00:24:32.495 --> 00:24:36.036]  The biggest threat isn't that we completely lost Michigan.
[00:24:36.556 --> 00:24:42.097]  But that some of the solid red states like Texas were close.
[00:24:42.097 --> 00:24:47.419]  How can you be close to Robert O'Rourke in Texas?
[00:24:47.419 --> 00:24:48.479]  This is insanity.
[00:24:48.479 --> 00:24:51.000]  So, you're right, we do know what to do, Alex.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.020]  We need to raise more hell.
[00:24:53.020 --> 00:25:04.063]  We need to shout from the mountaintop of our everyday lives what the Constitution, the Bill of Rights identifies and outlines, and start demanding that kind of accountability from our elected employees.
[00:25:04.063 --> 00:25:05.043]  And here in the state of Michigan,
[00:25:05.163 --> 00:25:05.943]  And what you said is critical.
[00:25:05.943 --> 00:25:07.404]  The Democrats have said, get out there, bully.
[00:25:07.404 --> 00:25:08.264]  Don't let them eat in restaurants.
[00:25:08.264 --> 00:25:09.484]  Don't let them go to grocery stores.
[00:25:09.484 --> 00:25:10.985]  Don't let them go to gas stations.
[00:25:10.985 --> 00:25:11.785]  And they do it to me.
[00:25:11.785 --> 00:25:12.865]  When they do it, I get right back in their face.
[00:25:12.865 --> 00:25:16.446]  We don't want to be criminal bullies, but in our lives, leftists and globalists and minions,
[00:25:33.191 --> 00:25:40.916]  We need to either get them to wake up and understand what's happening or we need to stop associating with them and not do business with them and say, listen, we're not your slaves.
[00:25:40.916 --> 00:25:43.758]  And if you want to have a political and economic fight, you're going to get one.
[00:25:43.758 --> 00:25:47.100]  This is a war and they're organized to take us over.
[00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:47.920]  And you get it.
[00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:48.340]  I get it.
[00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:49.641]  They used to call us extreme.
[00:25:49.641 --> 00:25:52.923]  They don't anymore because they say the Republicans are radicalizing.
[00:25:52.923 --> 00:25:54.804]  It's because the left is radical.
[00:25:54.804 --> 00:25:55.925]  We were never radical.
[00:25:55.925 --> 00:25:59.027]  Freedom is radical compared to tyranny, but they're coming after us.
[00:25:59.027 --> 00:26:00.448]  We don't have a choice.
[00:26:01.206 --> 00:26:04.889]  I have a message for my fellow Texans, who I love dearly.
[00:26:04.889 --> 00:26:08.031]  I mean, the best Texans are the best people in the world.
[00:26:08.031 --> 00:26:10.233]  And that goes for everybody all across this country.
[00:26:10.233 --> 00:26:14.536]  I've got friends in Canada that are as Texans as Texans.
[00:26:14.536 --> 00:26:22.762]  But we've talked about this every time since the first time we shared a microphone, Alex, from the first time we shared a coffee at the Nuger Ranch.
[00:26:22.762 --> 00:26:28.527]  The biggest curse in America today isn't the liberals.
[00:26:28.527 --> 00:26:29.868]  It isn't the Democrats.
[00:26:30.732 --> 00:26:32.733]  It's the apathy in our own camp.
[00:26:32.733 --> 00:26:40.856]  I guarantee that Texas is the bellwether for the liberal crusade to destroy America and turn us into Venezuela.
[00:26:40.856 --> 00:26:55.421]  And that Texas are so cocky, which I love, so confident, which I love, that so many of them literally will look you in the eye and say, well, ain't no Beto O'Rourke gonna take over Texas.
[00:26:55.421 --> 00:26:57.582]  And they don't even vote!
[00:27:00.533 --> 00:27:07.077]  If the real Hellraisers, the real Independents, the real... Remember the Alamo Texans.
[00:27:07.077 --> 00:27:14.061]  If every one of them would have voted, we would have won with Ted Cruz in a landslide.
[00:27:14.061 --> 00:27:15.942]  But many of them took it for granted.
[00:27:15.942 --> 00:27:18.463]  Hey, you can't mess with Texas.
[00:27:18.463 --> 00:27:19.684]  They didn't even vote Alamo.
[00:27:19.904 --> 00:27:20.645]  No, I agree.
[00:27:20.645 --> 00:27:21.786]  Listen, I can't tell you.
[00:27:21.786 --> 00:27:30.733]  There's a lot of great Texans, and I'm from Texas, going back to the start of Texas, and the real Texas spirit is a special Americana thing, but so many people, they just take it for granted.
[00:27:30.733 --> 00:27:33.255]  They're like, I'll never put up with that.
[00:27:33.255 --> 00:27:33.856]  BS!
[00:27:33.856 --> 00:27:35.877]  This is a super bad wake-up call.
[00:27:36.718 --> 00:27:45.369]  But let me tell you, Austin, where my family's from, is literally like San Francisco, and it's now got the needles and feces downtown.
[00:27:45.369 --> 00:27:48.893]  And so I'm telling everybody, folks, the rest of the city's beautiful.
[00:27:48.893 --> 00:27:51.196]  These people are coming to conquer you.
[00:27:51.196 --> 00:27:53.539]  You better start getting in their damn faces.
[00:27:54.912 --> 00:28:09.163]  Yeah, bottom line is if you believe enough in the American dream and that you choose your own path in life and you do the best that you can do, if you believe in that, you can't just do it unto yourself.
[00:28:09.163 --> 00:28:11.485]  You have to demand that from everyone around you.
[00:28:11.485 --> 00:28:23.735]  And when you see slovenly behavior, when you see liberal denial and fake news and political correct scourge, when you see it, you can't just walk away and shrug your shoulders and go,
[00:28:24.295 --> 00:28:25.516]  Well, nothing I can do.
[00:28:25.516 --> 00:28:27.679]  Well, there is something you can do.
[00:28:27.679 --> 00:28:31.142]  We need to be firm and confrontational.
[00:28:31.142 --> 00:28:31.943]  The great H.L.
[00:28:31.943 --> 00:28:39.211]  Richardson out of Northern California, a great senator, he wrote the book that guided the Newt Gingrich's and Ronald Reagan's.
[00:28:39.211 --> 00:28:43.155]  The book is titled, Confrontational Politics.
[00:28:43.155 --> 00:28:45.198]  The only politics that matter are
[00:28:46.139 --> 00:28:48.804]  Ted Nugent, you are awesome.
[00:28:48.804 --> 00:28:50.768]  The album comes out in two days.
[00:28:50.768 --> 00:28:51.790]  The music made me do it.
[00:28:51.790 --> 00:28:53.935]  I'm gonna be getting it at tednugent.com.
[00:28:53.935 --> 00:28:54.496]  God bless you.

[00:29:29.008 --> 00:29:35.373]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[00:29:35.373 --> 00:29:38.415]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[00:29:38.415 --> 00:29:44.339]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[00:29:44.339 --> 00:29:48.122]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[00:29:48.122 --> 00:29:49.402]  Was there ever a vote?
[00:29:49.402 --> 00:29:50.743]  Who do we fight for?
[00:29:50.743 --> 00:29:56.948]  The Deep State began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[00:29:56.948 --> 00:29:58.369]  Available at Amazon Books.
[00:30:00.458 --> 00:30:04.739]  Please, whatever you do, realize that we're all getting punched drunk to the censorship.
[00:30:04.739 --> 00:30:08.200]  And you saw 18 Twitter accounts, they say, affiliated with InfoWars.
[00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:09.960]  Yeah, some of them are like little side accounts.
[00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:13.241]  They know we had like InfoWars store that just showed our products.
[00:30:13.241 --> 00:30:20.023]  But they just banned them all yesterday in punishment that I be at a Trump rally and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us.
[00:30:20.023 --> 00:30:25.104]  Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from the brick.
[00:30:25.444 --> 00:30:31.570]  But the globalists now want to target where the resistance came from, so that we're not pesky in the future.
[00:30:31.570 --> 00:30:34.533]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[00:30:34.533 --> 00:30:35.634]  I want to keep going.
[00:30:35.634 --> 00:30:39.498]  I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially.
[00:30:39.498 --> 00:30:41.480]  I want to push all the way.
[00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:42.781]  I've committed to do that.
[00:30:42.781 --> 00:30:43.862]  I've prayed for that.
[00:30:43.862 --> 00:30:45.503]  And I've been told that's going to happen.
[00:30:45.503 --> 00:30:47.926]  But you've got to back us, and I promise you this.
[00:30:48.426 --> 00:30:49.748]  I will never falter.
[00:30:49.748 --> 00:30:52.070]  I will never waver at the spiritual level.
[00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:53.011]  I physically will.
[00:30:53.011 --> 00:31:00.139]  But I give you my commitment, if you financially support us, and fullrestore.com to give you my absolute total commitment.
[00:31:00.139 --> 00:31:08.528]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym, or to go for a run, or go to the park, or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[00:31:08.528 --> 00:31:08.989]  Believe me.
[00:31:09.349 --> 00:31:09.969]  I know.
[00:31:09.969 --> 00:31:14.672]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[00:31:14.672 --> 00:31:19.915]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarestore.com, I still have that energy.
[00:31:19.915 --> 00:31:34.122]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive
[00:31:34.522 --> 00:31:40.567]  To get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.

[00:33:02.827 --> 00:33:05.488]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:15.274 --> 00:33:17.015]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:33:17.015 --> 00:33:32.340]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:33.820]  Is it a rebuke of this message?
[00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:38.442]  Do you think that this is more reflective of multi-ethnic and multicultural America?
[00:33:38.442 --> 00:33:40.703]  Well, that question, I can only say this.
[00:33:41.696 --> 00:33:51.922]  You look at the employment and unemployment numbers for African-Americans, for Asian-Americans, for Hispanic-Americans, they're at a historic high.
[00:33:51.922 --> 00:33:59.045]  A poll came out recently where my numbers with Hispanics and with African-Americans are the highest, the best they've ever been.
[00:33:59.045 --> 00:34:02.247]  That took place two or three days ago, the poll.
[00:34:02.247 --> 00:34:03.208]  I have the best numbers
[00:34:04.218 --> 00:34:10.101]  with african-american and hispanic-american that I've ever had before.
[00:34:10.101 --> 00:34:11.142]  Then you saw the same poll.
[00:34:11.142 --> 00:34:12.502]  So I can't say that.
[00:34:12.502 --> 00:34:15.364]  I can say this.
[00:34:15.364 --> 00:34:18.485]  Now again, folks, we're carrying some of the live satellite feeds and one of those cut out.
[00:34:18.485 --> 00:34:19.486]  We have two other feeds.
[00:34:19.486 --> 00:34:24.748]  We'll go to some more of those or may have jumped to another channel here in just a moment.
[00:34:24.748 --> 00:34:27.370]  But notice that they go right to race.
[00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:29.451]  Right to race.
[00:34:29.451 --> 00:34:30.171]  Every question.
[00:34:30.171 --> 00:34:31.112]  Race, race.
[00:34:31.112 --> 00:34:33.594]  Democrats are the party of minorities.
[00:34:33.594 --> 00:34:34.955]  Republicans are the party of whites.
[00:34:34.955 --> 00:34:39.077]  That's all the Democrats say, hoping to brainwash all these immigrants coming into the country.
[00:34:39.077 --> 00:34:43.100]  That A, whites hate them, even though we're the biggest, richest, open country.
[00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:45.422]  And that they deserve free stuff.
[00:34:45.422 --> 00:34:46.483]  And that's all that's asked.
[00:34:47.489 --> 00:34:49.870]  And that's all the corporate media puts out.
[00:34:49.870 --> 00:34:53.591]  They are so desperate to do this that they ignore all the real numbers and everything else.
[00:34:53.591 --> 00:34:56.311]  But this is the demographic plan.
[00:34:56.311 --> 00:35:00.713]  Bring in all the minorities, make them the majority, and make it an anti-white majority.
[00:35:00.713 --> 00:35:08.615]  This is what the old Democrat establishment is trying to do, is inflict the new populations, the minority populations, with a serious
[00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:11.871]  KKK chip on their shoulder.
[00:35:11.871 --> 00:35:13.332]  We got another satellite feed back up.
[00:35:13.332 --> 00:35:15.273]  Here's the president.
[00:35:15.273 --> 00:35:18.375]  So we are working many plans for health care.
[00:35:18.375 --> 00:35:20.356]  We're creating tremendous competition.
[00:35:20.356 --> 00:35:23.258]  We had Obamacare repealed and replaced.
[00:35:23.258 --> 00:35:28.501]  Unfortunately, one person changed his mind at the last moment, and we had no Democrat support.
[00:35:28.501 --> 00:35:30.462]  I have to say that we didn't have one vote.
[00:35:30.462 --> 00:35:32.503]  We would have repealed it, replaced it.
[00:35:32.503 --> 00:35:36.225]  We would have had a large scale, very good health care plan.
[00:35:36.225 --> 00:35:37.526]  Now we're doing it a different way.
[00:35:38.106 --> 00:35:39.787]  We're doing it a different way.
[00:35:39.787 --> 00:35:47.673]  But getting rid of the individual mandate is a very, very popular thing and a very important thing and people very much appreciate it.
[00:35:47.673 --> 00:35:48.274]  Think about that.
[00:35:49.967 --> 00:35:51.489]  Making you buy healthcare.
[00:35:51.489 --> 00:35:52.770]  That's enough.
[00:35:52.770 --> 00:35:53.171]  Go ahead, please.
[00:36:08.968 --> 00:36:11.890]  Well, I think the results that I've learned may be confirmed.
[00:36:11.890 --> 00:36:13.250]  I think people like me.
[00:36:13.250 --> 00:36:15.872]  I think people like the job I'm doing, frankly.
[00:36:15.872 --> 00:36:20.214]  Because if you look at every place I went to do a rally, I couldn't do it with everybody.
[00:36:20.214 --> 00:36:20.935]  That's key.
[00:36:20.935 --> 00:36:31.841]  And it was very hard to do it with people in Congress, because there's just too many... All the states where the Democrats bet against Trump and where he showed up to fight them, the people won.
[00:36:32.878 --> 00:36:33.619]  Who were underdogs.
[00:36:33.619 --> 00:36:34.399]  And he won.
[00:36:34.399 --> 00:36:36.861]  He won a very tough race against McGrath.
[00:36:36.861 --> 00:36:37.822]  Florida, Tennessee.
[00:36:37.822 --> 00:36:40.904]  I was a very, very tough race in Kentucky.
[00:36:40.904 --> 00:36:42.805]  And he was down quite a bit.
[00:36:42.805 --> 00:36:46.768]  And I went there and we had a tremendous, very successful, some of you were at that rally.
[00:36:46.768 --> 00:36:48.990]  And to fade him down for a moment, let me just back the President up.
[00:36:48.990 --> 00:36:50.391]  Paul Watson tweeted this.
[00:36:50.391 --> 00:36:54.114]  Obama lost 63 seats in the first midterm.
[00:36:54.114 --> 00:36:54.594]  Clinton 52.
[00:36:54.594 --> 00:36:56.516]  I'm not going to go back through these numbers again.
[00:36:57.682 --> 00:36:59.605]  Trump, 20-something.
[00:36:59.605 --> 00:37:02.529]  So, of course, those are numbers as of this morning.
[00:37:02.529 --> 00:37:03.811]  It's been a few more now.
[00:37:03.811 --> 00:37:11.962]  But the point is, we're not even calling this a victory, but it's a pyrrhic victory for the Democrats because they lost three seats in the Senate.
[00:37:11.962 --> 00:37:13.063]  I'm going to break that down more.
[00:37:13.063 --> 00:37:14.666]  Let's go back to the press conference with the President.
[00:37:16.286 --> 00:37:17.767]  Well, I haven't asked him, but I hope so.
[00:37:17.767 --> 00:37:19.048]  Where are you?
[00:37:19.048 --> 00:37:21.410]  Mike, will you be my running mate?
[00:37:21.410 --> 00:37:22.231]  Huh?
[00:37:22.231 --> 00:37:23.172]  Stand up, Mike, please.
[00:37:23.172 --> 00:37:23.853]  Raise your right hand.
[00:37:23.853 --> 00:37:25.754]  No, I'm only kidding.
[00:37:25.754 --> 00:37:26.475]  Will you?
[00:37:26.475 --> 00:37:26.935]  Thank you.
[00:37:26.935 --> 00:37:27.676]  Okay, good.
[00:37:27.676 --> 00:37:28.717]  The answer is yes.
[00:37:28.717 --> 00:37:28.937]  Okay.
[00:37:28.937 --> 00:37:30.398]  Thank you, sir.
[00:37:30.398 --> 00:37:33.001]  That was unexpected, but I feel very fine.
[00:37:35.107 --> 00:37:36.068]  Uh, yeah, please.
[00:37:36.068 --> 00:37:36.988]  Thank you, Mr. President.
[00:37:36.988 --> 00:37:43.931]  Going back to the Russia investigation and the potential investigations from the now democratically- Back to the judiciary.
[00:37:43.931 --> 00:37:48.414]  Majority in Congress, some say that you could stop all this by declassifying- I could.
[00:37:48.414 --> 00:37:53.996]  I could fire everybody right now, but I don't want to stop it because politically I don't like stopping it.
[00:37:53.996 --> 00:37:54.737]  It's a disgrace.
[00:37:55.957 --> 00:37:59.779]  It should have never been started because there was no crime.
[00:37:59.779 --> 00:38:08.745]  It is, everybody has conflicts, they all have conflicts over there that are beyond anything that anybody's ever seen in terms of conflicts.
[00:38:08.745 --> 00:38:18.751]  From the fact that people ask for jobs, from the fact that they have very good friends on the other side, like really good friends like Comey,
[00:38:19.787 --> 00:38:25.031]  Who, by the way, lied and leaked and also leaked classified information.
[00:38:25.031 --> 00:38:26.772]  Nothing happened there.
[00:38:26.772 --> 00:38:28.113]  It might, perhaps.
[00:38:28.113 --> 00:38:30.215]  Maybe something's happening that I don't know about.
[00:38:30.215 --> 00:38:31.356]  I stay away from it.
[00:38:31.356 --> 00:38:32.116]  But you know what I do?
[00:38:32.116 --> 00:38:34.318]  I let it just go on.
[00:38:34.318 --> 00:38:36.039]  They're wasting a lot of money.
[00:38:36.039 --> 00:38:37.540]  But I let it go on.
[00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:39.782]  Because I don't want to do that.
[00:38:39.782 --> 00:38:40.563]  But you're right.
[00:38:40.563 --> 00:38:41.864]  I could end it right now.
[00:38:41.864 --> 00:38:44.466]  I could say that investigation is over.
[00:38:45.575 --> 00:38:50.177]  But it's, it's really, um, it's a disgrace, frankly.
[00:38:50.177 --> 00:38:54.999]  And it's an embarrassment to our country, it's an embarrassment to the people of our country.
[00:38:54.999 --> 00:38:57.580]  That saying, the election is illegitimate.
[00:38:57.580 --> 00:38:59.160]  What about declassification of the documents?
[00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:00.401]  Some say that that would clear it all up.
[00:39:00.401 --> 00:39:00.981]  We're looking at that.
[00:39:00.981 --> 00:39:02.522]  No, no, we're looking at that very seriously.
[00:39:02.522 --> 00:39:04.383]  Declassification, we're looking at that very seriously.
[00:39:04.383 --> 00:39:06.123]  Okay, can I ask one more question?
[00:39:06.123 --> 00:39:10.605]  It's amazing how people on the other side just don't want those documents declassified.
[00:39:10.605 --> 00:39:12.846]  But, no, we're looking at that very carefully.
[00:39:12.846 --> 00:39:15.007]  I certainly wanted to wait until after the midterms.
[00:39:15.307 --> 00:39:18.269]  Can I ask you one more question, Mr. President?
[00:39:18.269 --> 00:39:19.009]  Okay, thank you.
[00:39:19.009 --> 00:39:20.871]  Go ahead.
[00:39:20.871 --> 00:39:21.851]  Thank you, Mr. President.
[00:39:21.851 --> 00:39:24.073]  You have campaigned as a pro-life president.
[00:39:24.073 --> 00:39:26.414]  You have defended the rights of unborn children.
[00:39:26.414 --> 00:39:27.815]  You now have a divided Congress.
[00:39:27.815 --> 00:39:30.897]  It's unlikely to pass any pro-life bills.
[00:39:30.897 --> 00:39:31.998]  Very tough issue.
[00:39:31.998 --> 00:39:34.139]  How are you going to push forward your pro-life agenda?
[00:39:34.139 --> 00:39:34.840]  Just going to push.
[00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:36.000]  I've been pushing.
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.361]  I've done a very good job, too.
[00:39:37.361 --> 00:39:38.082]  I'm very happy with it.
[00:39:38.082 --> 00:39:39.503]  He's got two Supreme Court justices in.
[00:39:40.183 --> 00:39:41.124]  Pro-life.
[00:39:41.124 --> 00:39:43.005]  But what are you going to do?
[00:39:43.005 --> 00:39:45.827]  And he goes to pro-life events, something other Republicans never did.
[00:39:45.827 --> 00:39:52.451]  Because it is an issue that is a very divisive, polarizing issue.
[00:39:52.451 --> 00:39:55.012]  But there is a solution.
[00:39:55.012 --> 00:39:58.294]  I think I have that solution, and nobody else does.
[00:39:58.294 --> 00:40:00.796]  We're going to be working on that.
[00:40:00.796 --> 00:40:03.478]  Yes, go ahead, please.
[00:40:03.478 --> 00:40:07.000]  This is live coverage of the President's post-election press conference?
[00:40:08.007 --> 00:40:10.668]  Mr. President, just a quick question on rural America.
[00:40:10.668 --> 00:40:14.710]  In states like Indiana, North Dakota, folks turned out for Republican candidates.
[00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:19.791]  Could you talk a little bit about what this means for your agenda in terms of trade and the Farm Bill?
[00:40:19.791 --> 00:40:21.872]  The Farm Bill is working really well.
[00:40:21.872 --> 00:40:26.094]  I mean, we could have had it approved any time, but we're looking to get work rules approved.
[00:40:26.094 --> 00:40:27.074]  The farmers want it.
[00:40:27.074 --> 00:40:28.055]  I'd like it.
[00:40:28.055 --> 00:40:31.556]  The problem is the Democrats are not giving us the 10 votes that we need.
[00:40:31.556 --> 00:40:32.816]  We are.
[00:40:32.816 --> 00:40:33.837]  Everybody wants it.
[00:40:33.837 --> 00:40:34.997]  The farmers want it.
[00:40:34.997 --> 00:40:36.798]  But the Democrats are not approving
[00:40:37.478 --> 00:40:38.958]  The farm bill with work rules.
[00:40:38.958 --> 00:40:47.321]  We could have it very fast without the work rules, but we want the work rules in and the Democrats... All right, this is a live feed.
[00:40:47.321 --> 00:40:48.381]  We also have it recorded.
[00:40:48.381 --> 00:40:49.941]  We're going to have a bunch of big tidbits for you.
[00:40:49.941 --> 00:40:51.802]  We're going to come back with more of this.
[00:40:51.802 --> 00:40:55.963]  Who could get Roger Stone during the firestorm of the post election?
[00:40:55.963 --> 00:40:59.244]  And then, of course, them saying all over the news he's going to be indicted on Friday.
[00:40:59.244 --> 00:41:02.065]  And I'm not allowed to tell you what Roger's lawyer told him privately, but...
[00:41:03.234 --> 00:41:08.382]  We'll see if Roger will tell you when he's here in the next hour riding shotgun to the balance of the show.
[00:41:08.382 --> 00:41:13.130]  And Paul Joseph Watson hosts the fourth hour and the war room comes right through.
[00:41:13.130 --> 00:41:15.373]  And I just want to say the crew's done an amazing job.
[00:41:16.618 --> 00:41:18.420]  The listeners have done an amazing job.
[00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:20.061]  We couldn't have done this without all of you.
[00:41:20.061 --> 00:41:21.382]  We have a major beachhead.
[00:41:21.382 --> 00:41:24.105]  Trump is totally delivered on everything he could actually get done.
[00:41:24.105 --> 00:41:31.231]  We can pick and choose where the strongman stumbled, should have declassified the documents, should have moved ahead against big tech earlier.
[00:41:31.231 --> 00:41:34.134]  But I understand the way politics and things like this work.
[00:41:34.134 --> 00:41:35.035]  He's trying to figure it out.
[00:41:35.035 --> 00:41:38.538]  He has his own crew blocking him, which they brag about.
[00:41:38.538 --> 00:41:40.339]  So it's up to us to make a big deal out of this.
[00:41:40.339 --> 00:41:42.861]  But really, as we go into the shape of things to come,
[00:41:44.039 --> 00:41:50.542]  I'm going to be writing that down in the next hour of a battle plan that will win the future, not just win this battle or that battle, but win the future.
[00:41:50.542 --> 00:42:01.708]  But we deflected the global CHICOM, EU, Hollywood rage and defied
[00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:03.770]  U.S.
[00:42:03.770 --> 00:42:10.892]  history for the lowest amount of seats in the last 118 plus years.
[00:42:10.892 --> 00:42:13.013]  I haven't gone back past that.
[00:42:13.013 --> 00:42:21.055]  Just no one's ever won the House and Senate both back together after a midterm since the end of the Civil War.
[00:42:21.055 --> 00:42:23.596]  But I know for a fact that going back to the turn of the last century,
[00:42:25.566 --> 00:42:28.607]  118 years that no one has ever had losses this low.
[00:42:28.607 --> 00:42:33.028]  So that is a big win, but it still shows us how powerful the enemy is.
[00:42:33.028 --> 00:42:35.069]  That our whole economy, everything's turning around.
[00:42:35.069 --> 00:42:40.670]  Like you're in a room with no oxygen and somebody opens the bulkhead door and you're like, I can breathe.
[00:42:40.670 --> 00:42:42.851]  Now let me, let me take you out because you saved me.
[00:42:42.851 --> 00:42:45.972]  It's just like these people have no instincts.
[00:42:45.972 --> 00:42:47.372]  They have no spirit.
[00:42:47.372 --> 00:42:49.492]  They have no damn common sense.
[00:42:49.492 --> 00:42:51.373]  America has been taken over by globalists.
[00:42:51.633 --> 00:42:54.234]  Trump and Infowars are fighting to return it.
[00:42:54.234 --> 00:42:56.855]  I know our audience knows that, but that's the truth.
[00:42:56.855 --> 00:42:59.215]  That's the message.
[00:42:59.215 --> 00:43:08.498]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[00:43:08.498 --> 00:43:11.379]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[00:43:11.379 --> 00:43:17.401]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[00:43:18.081 --> 00:43:24.344]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source, and the Globeless tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[00:43:24.344 --> 00:43:30.627]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[00:43:30.627 --> 00:43:37.570]  Now, due to the Establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[00:43:38.710 --> 00:43:51.738]  Chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[00:43:51.738 --> 00:43:55.980]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[00:43:55.980 --> 00:43:58.662]  X3, now available at mpullerslife.com.
[00:43:59.218 --> 00:44:01.921]  Stress is a natural part of life.

[00:45:00.114 --> 00:45:10.722]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[00:45:10.722 --> 00:45:12.784]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[00:45:12.784 --> 00:45:15.646]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[00:45:15.646 --> 00:45:17.127]  It's made in the USA.
[00:45:17.127 --> 00:45:20.270]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are
[00:45:20.490 --> 00:45:23.931]  Absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[00:45:23.931 --> 00:45:26.032]  It is a classical 360 win.
[00:45:26.032 --> 00:45:35.734]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[00:45:35.734 --> 00:45:48.458]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reach
[00:45:48.578 --> 00:45:50.719]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[00:46:05.245 --> 00:46:13.928]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt Justice Department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[00:46:13.928 --> 00:46:15.889]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[00:46:15.889 --> 00:46:19.350]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[00:46:19.350 --> 00:46:21.971]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[00:46:21.971 --> 00:46:24.272]  So we've already had incredible success.
[00:46:24.272 --> 00:46:31.215]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is, and understand how real this fight is, and why we've been made the main target,
[00:46:31.775 --> 00:46:41.557]  And if you financially support us, and if you spread the word about our articles and videos, InfoWars.com, we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags.
[00:46:41.557 --> 00:46:42.738]  We'll win.
[00:46:42.738 --> 00:46:45.638]  We have huge sales at InfoWars4.com right now.
[00:46:45.638 --> 00:46:52.800]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact we're trying to block our commerce and your right to the market.
[00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:56.481]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros and Globus may win.
[00:46:56.481 --> 00:46:58.042]  This is InfoWars Darkest Hour.
[00:46:58.042 --> 00:46:58.722]  We need your support.
[00:46:58.722 --> 00:46:59.462]  I'm counting on you.
[00:47:03.830 --> 00:47:06.446]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:21.414 --> 00:47:22.594]  You found it.
[00:47:22.594 --> 00:47:25.635]  The front lines of the human awakening.
[00:47:25.635 --> 00:47:27.735]  It's the InfoWars.
[00:47:27.735 --> 00:47:29.736]  And now, Alex Jones.
[00:47:29.736 --> 00:47:31.356]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:47:31.356 --> 00:47:31.856]  to 3 p.m.
[00:47:31.856 --> 00:47:33.417]  Central.
[00:47:33.417 --> 00:47:35.157]  I'm here, Alex Jones.
[00:47:35.157 --> 00:47:38.258]  This is what I call InfoWars Live.
[00:47:38.258 --> 00:47:39.238]  It's Listen to Satellites.
[00:47:39.238 --> 00:47:41.198]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:49.753 --> 00:47:53.475]  I was sitting here during the break looking over news articles and even Reuters
[00:48:19.156 --> 00:48:31.700]  Admits that the stock market and the economy is going to cool with the Democrats in the House because people know traditionally they actually try to sabotage the US economy in the last 30 years.
[00:48:31.700 --> 00:48:34.641]  They have a hard-on for the nation.
[00:48:34.641 --> 00:48:36.062]  They want poor constituents.
[00:48:36.062 --> 00:48:37.042]  They don't want jobs.
[00:48:37.042 --> 00:48:38.683]  They don't want factories.
[00:48:38.683 --> 00:48:39.783]  They want control.
[00:48:41.425 --> 00:48:46.707]  And with the globalists trying to move robots in and replace all humans and all the farmers, this problem's going to get worse.
[00:48:46.707 --> 00:49:01.654]  And then with the global social score, if you're a good little globalist and get sterilized or do the things they want you to, you get all this free stuff put on your card, and people that don't play ball, no matter how productive you are, you starve to death.
[00:49:03.416 --> 00:49:08.618]  Isaac Asimov wrote about this in his Foundation series and his iRobot series.
[00:49:08.618 --> 00:49:16.720]  And if you knew that why he won those big global science fiction awards is he was involved in a thing called predictive programming.
[00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:19.381]  He was actually putting out a lot of the ideas of Karl Marx in them.
[00:49:20.319 --> 00:49:24.201]  But putting it with some other science fiction-y Fabian socialist ideas.
[00:49:24.201 --> 00:49:27.524]  Not knocking Isaac Asimov, he was a great writer.
[00:49:27.524 --> 00:49:34.148]  I don't know if he was supporting communism or Marxism.
[00:49:34.148 --> 00:49:38.851]  But it was certainly a system of that in the making.
[00:49:38.851 --> 00:49:40.532]  He talked about the public wants baubles.
[00:49:41.536 --> 00:49:52.462]  Little digital handheld devices that could give them access to libraries and give them access to galactic systems of communication.
[00:49:52.462 --> 00:50:01.747]  As long as they had that and their little hovel and their fashion and their styles, they didn't care if their kids didn't even belong to them or the state sterilized them.
[00:50:01.747 --> 00:50:03.768]  I mean, he wrote about stuff like that in the 50s.
[00:50:06.533 --> 00:50:08.955]  And then now you see that's where we are.
[00:50:08.955 --> 00:50:17.880]  And so see, they know they can get us just addicted to computers, addicted to iPhones, addicted to baubles, and then really take everything we've got.
[00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:25.045]  And because of mass production, you can have people really working only five, 10 hours a week, and being able to take care of themselves.
[00:50:25.045 --> 00:50:27.307]  But they don't, the globals don't want to get to that point.
[00:50:27.307 --> 00:50:33.110]  They'll give you right at the subsistence level, and they'll give you the trinkets of success, but never have you become independent.
[00:50:33.110 --> 00:50:35.092]  So it is just another form of slavery.
[00:50:35.947 --> 00:50:42.835]  And it's being done towards total domestication so there can be an orderly depopulation.
[00:50:42.835 --> 00:50:46.739]  And a lot of people then argue, well, hell, let's just depopulate then.
[00:50:46.739 --> 00:50:50.203]  There are too many dumb people, too many lazy people.
[00:50:51.598 --> 00:50:58.080]  But if you look at the main equation here, it basically turns almost everyone into this, including your own children.
[00:50:58.080 --> 00:51:12.103]  There's a societal feedback loop that if you lower the majority of the people around you to a certain level, especially by artificial environmental means that are projected from an ambient position as to be delivered as a background
[00:51:12.983 --> 00:51:23.428]  deployment and not a selective deployment, it will absolutely completely take control of your progeny and your own system and will basically radiate you.
[00:51:23.428 --> 00:51:36.113]  If you wanted to use radiation as a mathematical example of the fact that you will not escape what you do to others.
[00:51:36.113 --> 00:51:37.254]  And I hope that was pretty clear.
[00:51:38.365 --> 00:51:39.886]  I certainly know it's clear to the establishment.
[00:51:39.886 --> 00:51:48.351]  So, this is not a good thing that's being done, even from the perspective of the people putting it up.
[00:51:48.351 --> 00:51:55.255]  And there's a lot of other novel scams to this, just like Asimov told you, and then we're going to have computers and robots that work for the state.
[00:51:56.758 --> 00:51:59.840]  And they're going to end up having rights as well.
[00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:04.763]  And that really means the people that control them will have those rights and then outvote you.
[00:52:04.763 --> 00:52:13.068]  They won't really be sentient or alive, but under the whole trans movement, they're going to give rights to a fire hydrant if they want to.
[00:52:13.068 --> 00:52:15.690]  And people keep asking, how do I know this whole plan?
[00:52:15.690 --> 00:52:17.271]  Because I know the Fabian socialist plan.
[00:52:18.382 --> 00:52:41.027]  I know that they only promoted theoreticians and writers and thinkers that were taking them along the line of the world they wanted, a post-human world, because their God is going to give them life extension and give them power, but at a certain point, they have to give their body up and be uploaded into this larger consciousness that will then move on to the next planet.
[00:52:41.027 --> 00:52:43.128]  You're probably saying, I read that in Childhood's End.
[00:52:43.128 --> 00:52:43.328]  Yes.
[00:52:43.928 --> 00:52:47.755]  Former head of the British Illuminati wrote Childhood's End.
[00:52:47.755 --> 00:52:52.383]  He also wrote 2001 Space Odyssey and that entire Luciferian trilogy.
[00:52:53.433 --> 00:52:57.977]  So you might want to figure out what they're planning for you and your family.
[00:52:57.977 --> 00:53:09.906]  Because they believe an off-world entity known as Lucifer, Isaac Asimov, and all these folks, is going to give them the blueprints on how to take over.
[00:53:09.906 --> 00:53:21.175]  They've just got to kill themselves and their families once they get to the point, and basically put on the black Nike tennis shoes, the black outfits, drink the vodka and barbiturates, and they'll be beamed up to hellbob.
[00:53:21.175 --> 00:53:21.335]  Yes.
[00:53:22.532 --> 00:53:33.197]  Now you know why they have sub-cults that learn about what Silicon Valley's really into, take it too far, actually believe that it's coming in this generation, and then decide they want on board the spacecraft immediately.
[00:53:34.209 --> 00:53:37.731]  But of course, the whole thing is a giant satanic con game.
[00:53:37.731 --> 00:53:39.631]  So you want to know what they're doing at Silicon Valley?
[00:53:39.631 --> 00:53:51.957]  They're taking LSD and mushrooms almost every day, microdosing, and believe they're in communication with demon creatures that are giving them control of the future.
[00:53:52.757 --> 00:54:06.662]  Of course, I told you this 20-something years ago, and now it's like shocking and cutting edge when Joe Rogan has guests on that say the exact thing, or Elon Musk says it, but that's what they're doing at the CIA Research Institute there in San Francisco.
[00:54:06.662 --> 00:54:09.223]  That's another name, but I don't think I'll give it to you today.
[00:54:09.223 --> 00:54:15.265]  So, I learned about all this when I was a kid from folks that actually worked inside at San Francisco in the alien contact facilities.
[00:54:16.205 --> 00:54:19.886]  Where they take the drugs and then contact the aliens.
[00:54:19.886 --> 00:54:22.267]  Let's just say I don't even know the aliens are real.
[00:54:22.267 --> 00:54:29.549]  Is this some psychological fragment or some genetic fragment in humans from somewhere in our development that we're now reconjuring?
[00:54:29.549 --> 00:54:30.349]  I don't know.
[00:54:30.349 --> 00:54:41.273]  The elite believe that they're in access with extraterrestrials and the extraterrestrials are giving them technology to build a system to enslave humanity and then kill everybody.
[00:54:41.273 --> 00:54:42.093]  And they think that's a good thing.
[00:54:42.813 --> 00:54:43.773]  I don't know.
[00:54:43.773 --> 00:54:44.674]  You're going to see them build it.
[00:54:44.674 --> 00:54:45.794]  You're going to see it happen.
[00:54:45.794 --> 00:54:47.794]  You know, it fits right in with Revelation.
[00:54:47.794 --> 00:54:52.736]  Revelation, there's fallen angels that want to build a world government, a cashless society, can't buy or sell without it.
[00:54:52.736 --> 00:54:55.737]  If you're not good, they'll cut you off the digital system like it's now happening to me.
[00:54:55.737 --> 00:55:04.459]  You know, if I say, you know, they're taking drugs in Silicon Valley, they believe they're going to worship Lucifer, they're merging with one world government, they then want me off the air.
[00:55:04.459 --> 00:55:07.340]  And it's not because I'm saying a bunch of babble or a bunch of bull.
[00:55:07.340 --> 00:55:08.560]  I've never seen any aliens.
[00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:09.741]  I don't believe in aliens.
[00:55:09.741 --> 00:55:10.001]  They do.
[00:55:11.101 --> 00:55:13.423]  It's an alien UFO cult.
[00:55:13.423 --> 00:55:19.987]  And offshoots of them, you know, drink vodka and take painkillers and all get in their little bunk beds and you'll think they're going to Valhalla.
[00:55:19.987 --> 00:55:23.569]  And these globalists are just a more sophisticated version of Hellbop.
[00:55:23.569 --> 00:55:33.035]  They just think they have to build the AI machine god that everyone will worship and you must worship it and it'll give us all the answers that really it then just starts killing everybody like Revelation says.
[00:55:33.035 --> 00:55:36.157]  But maybe we'll all listen when two-thirds of the Earth's been wiped out.
[00:55:36.157 --> 00:55:36.477]  We'll see.
[00:55:37.685 --> 00:55:43.208]  I'm just here trying to be a faithful person to the research and just tell you what the establishment actually thinks.
[00:55:43.208 --> 00:55:52.414]  Speaking of that, we might want to reach out to the president and say this internet deplatforming of Christians and conservatives and nationalists will then move to banking and everything else as really the mark of the beast.
[00:55:52.414 --> 00:55:57.137]  So we have a big letter written up specifically by myself and Roger Stone for the president.
[00:55:57.137 --> 00:56:06.423]  You can write your own letter and attach it to it, or just send your letter, print off a copy, send it yourself, and we're going to send every letter people sign for free on our site and pay for the postage.
[00:56:07.614 --> 00:56:09.695]  It's RightTrump.com.
[00:56:09.695 --> 00:56:10.775]  That's RightTrump.com.
[00:56:10.775 --> 00:56:13.056]  We'll put that on screen for folks.
[00:56:13.056 --> 00:56:19.938]  Sign your name on the letter to the president that will mail for you directly to the president at RightTrump.com.
[00:56:19.938 --> 00:56:34.563]  President Trump must understand the importance of putting a stop to the mass censorship of conservatives by big tech and initiate antitrust actions against it immediately to end this racketeering and collusion of the tech giants desperate to take back America.
[00:56:35.871 --> 00:56:51.523]  And you just saw, if we would have had motor voter laws, if the House had passed it in the last few years, but they choked and didn't, and if we wouldn't have had massive total censorship, we would have had America, with total political realignment, defeat, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:56:53.158 --> 00:57:00.784]  The trend that no one ever keeps the House and or Senate in the midterm after a new president is elected.
[00:57:00.784 --> 00:57:11.051]  But we had some of the lowest numbers ever since the Civil War of a victor for the Dems, but still Republicans, due to their lack of vision, gave that to the enemy.
[00:57:11.051 --> 00:57:14.674]  Please do not forget as well, we have a mega sale, the biggest
[00:57:15.925 --> 00:57:16.686]  Targeted sale.

[00:58:50.455 --> 00:58:52.817]  We all know the importance of fish oils.

[00:59:53.272 --> 01:00:03.975]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:03.975 --> 01:00:11.797]  I'm no stranger to the rain.
[01:00:11.797 --> 01:00:13.977]  I'm a friend of thunder.
[01:00:13.977 --> 01:00:20.279]  Friend as in any wonder lightning strikes me.
[01:00:20.279 --> 01:00:21.259]  I fought with the devil.
[01:00:24.854 --> 01:00:29.497]  Got down on his level.
[01:00:29.497 --> 01:00:34.579]  Good stuff right there.
[01:00:34.579 --> 01:00:40.022]  I'll give you my real take, which I'm still trying to fully gauge.
[01:00:40.022 --> 01:00:45.265]  At the start of the next segment, I'll put a deadline on it.
[01:00:45.265 --> 01:00:48.687]  I've got a lot of ideas, a lot of angles, but I want to really give the prime projection.
[01:00:51.783 --> 01:00:52.804]  That's coming up next segment.
[01:00:52.804 --> 01:00:55.405]  Roger Stone will ride shotgun with us for the balance of the show.
[01:00:55.405 --> 01:00:59.567]  He's in there doing research, making phone calls right now in the room next to me.
[01:00:59.567 --> 01:01:14.094]  And boy, if they are talking about indicting his butt on Friday, and I asked him personally last night, he's been on the phone with his lawyer, and I know that it's skinny, but I'm not authorized to tell you, but let me just tell you, this country's in a lot of trouble.
[01:01:16.087 --> 01:01:23.411]  But he may spill the beans, the guts, when he comes in here before he flies out of here tonight.
[01:01:23.411 --> 01:01:28.274]  I'm really sorry for the guy, because I'm in the same boat with him.
[01:01:28.274 --> 01:01:33.357]  Not as bad, but they're asking questions about me continually.
[01:01:33.357 --> 01:01:37.920]  Trying to set me up, and I've already had him now repeatedly try it.
[01:01:44.949 --> 01:01:48.994]  It's just amazing what they're trying to do to anybody that supports Trump.
[01:01:48.994 --> 01:01:51.556]  This is a real war for this country.
[01:01:51.556 --> 01:01:55.901]  And I'm happy to pay whatever price I have to because these folks are bad.
[01:01:55.901 --> 01:01:57.043]  It's my job to resist them.
[01:01:57.043 --> 01:02:05.972]  But man, when you see these traitors serving the Democratic Party and scumbags like Hillary Clinton and Beto O'Rourke, you know, his new name is
[01:02:07.489 --> 01:02:09.550]  I'll tell you his new name when we come back from break.
[01:02:09.550 --> 01:02:11.431]  That's a good idea.
[01:02:11.431 --> 01:02:12.791]  I can't ever hold on to something, can I?
[01:02:12.791 --> 01:02:13.872]  I'll just get it out there.
[01:02:13.872 --> 01:02:17.533]  You know his new name is Nacho O'Rourke.
[01:02:17.533 --> 01:02:20.134]  That's right, Nacho or Senators.
[01:02:20.134 --> 01:02:21.995]  That's going around as a meme.
[01:02:21.995 --> 01:02:25.616]  I had Pat Riley this morning show it to me before we went into the shoot downtown.
[01:02:25.616 --> 01:02:30.638]  I had two more people show it to me this morning, so we ought to find that meme if they didn't give it to you.
[01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:34.962]  Beto O'Rourke's new name is Nacho.
[01:02:34.962 --> 01:02:36.424]  Nacho O'Rourke.
[01:02:36.424 --> 01:02:37.805]  I mean, just the condescension.
[01:02:37.805 --> 01:02:42.369]  I saw another one where they put a French name on it.
[01:02:42.369 --> 01:02:44.031]  They put a Kunas name on it.
[01:02:44.031 --> 01:02:44.972]  I forget which one it was.
[01:02:44.972 --> 01:02:48.115]  Because, you know, he's a senator in Louisiana.
[01:02:48.115 --> 01:02:51.758]  So they're going to put a Kunas name on it.
[01:02:51.758 --> 01:02:54.080]  It's like when Hillary Clinton went to Kentucky.
[01:02:55.054 --> 01:03:02.019]  And then she talked like, good to be here with you, I'm really glad to be in Kentucky.
[01:03:02.019 --> 01:03:07.082]  I'm gonna have me some possum pot pie, some other good tasties.
[01:03:07.082 --> 01:03:13.746]  And then when she was out in California, she was like, hello Latinos, I am here, how are you?
[01:03:15.455 --> 01:03:18.616]  I'm the only other person I saw that's that bad, been condescending like that.
[01:03:18.616 --> 01:03:31.159]  I would be insulted if somebody from, if Donald Trump came to my house, or came to see me, or I was talking to Donald Trump on the phone, and because I'm from Texas, he went, uh, this is Yosemite Sam, Alex, how you doing there boy?
[01:03:31.159 --> 01:03:33.739]  I'd say, what type of weirdo are you?
[01:03:33.739 --> 01:03:37.500]  But he talked to me in that, you know, it's nice New York accent.
[01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:41.201]  There's some horrible New York accents, but I like Trump's New York accent.
[01:03:41.201 --> 01:03:43.282]  Uh, I like it.
[01:03:43.282 --> 01:03:44.182]  It's the real Donald Trump.
[01:03:46.195 --> 01:03:50.319]  It's just, there it is, Mexican word for the day, veto.
[01:03:50.319 --> 01:03:54.143]  Veto, take them signs out of the yard.
[01:03:54.143 --> 01:03:55.685]  Yeah, that's one of the ones I saw this morning.
[01:03:55.685 --> 01:04:03.172]  And then the other one was Beto O'Rourke is moving to Louisiana to run for senator and his new name is, it was a French name, O'Rourke.
[01:04:03.172 --> 01:04:07.917]  I mean, just the patronizing, the condescension is incredible.
[01:04:07.917 --> 01:04:09.939]  By the way, Trump's still speaking live.
[01:04:11.488 --> 01:04:15.971]  And he just had the eternal geek.
[01:04:15.971 --> 01:04:18.932]  People think of a geek as a person that, like, works on computers or something.
[01:04:18.932 --> 01:04:19.453]  No, no.
[01:04:19.453 --> 01:04:23.455]  A geek was a guy in a circus, bit the heads off rats and bats.
[01:04:23.455 --> 01:04:25.376]  So a geek would do something really, really stupid.
[01:04:26.502 --> 01:04:32.443]  And so, the Trump Acosta is coming up on the other side of the 60-second break.
[01:04:32.443 --> 01:04:34.644]  And I say this all the time, everybody knows it.
[01:04:34.644 --> 01:04:38.064]  If you don't promote the videos, if you don't promote the articles, nobody will.
[01:04:38.064 --> 01:04:44.326]  By the way, you've been doing it, so despite the censorship, we're still growing in the enemy's face.
[01:04:44.326 --> 01:04:49.147]  There are only other options to set me up or kill me, but hey, let's make them do it!
[01:04:49.147 --> 01:04:51.347]  I want to go in, through, and beyond.
[01:04:58.231 --> 01:05:02.352]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[01:05:02.352 --> 01:05:09.415]  InfoWars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with every faucet, shower, and sink in your home.

[01:05:57.432 --> 01:06:01.973]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:06:01.973 --> 01:06:05.434]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:27.591 --> 01:06:28.932]  Listen to that guitar.
[01:06:28.932 --> 01:06:43.120]  That's something you'd hear in heaven.
[01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:44.480]  And then there was a wind on down the road.
[01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:46.541]  Our shadows taller than our souls.
[01:06:46.541 --> 01:06:54.006]  There's a lady we all know, who shines like light in the shadows.
[01:06:58.860 --> 01:07:01.122]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:07:01.122 --> 01:07:01.662]  to 2 p.m.
[01:07:01.662 --> 01:07:03.103]  Central.
[01:07:03.103 --> 01:07:04.504]  I'm here live.
[01:07:04.504 --> 01:07:06.586]  Then Paul Watson's coming up in the third, fourth hour.
[01:07:06.586 --> 01:07:17.033]  And then we're gonna have The War Room with Owen Schroyer and, of course, Roger Stone.
[01:07:17.033 --> 01:07:25.799]  Roger Stone's gonna be in studio coming up in about T-minus 23 minutes.
[01:07:25.799 --> 01:07:28.201]  All right, let me get right into the meat and potatoes of this.
[01:07:29.605 --> 01:07:39.183]  We're going to have something for you by the middle of the third hour that is going to be very, very entertaining, but also very, very saddening.
[01:07:40.849 --> 01:08:06.571]  This morning I got a wild hair and I thought we should go somewhere where there's a whole bunch of veto signs and just walk amongst them as if it's the tombstones of the globalists and the communists and the foreign banks trying to capture Texas or are they like little mushrooms that have popped up and you laugh because they'll be blown away or they'll die but out of them will be the spores of the fall of Texas.
[01:08:06.571 --> 01:08:08.292]  So I had that idea in my head and then I thought no.
[01:08:09.653 --> 01:08:15.717]  Let me just call Pat Riley, who was coming over to lift weights with me and train me, stretch me out and everything.
[01:08:15.717 --> 01:08:17.978]  My personal trainer comes over like four days a week.
[01:08:17.978 --> 01:08:20.579]  Because if he doesn't, I won't get my ass up and do it.
[01:08:20.579 --> 01:08:28.504]  And I said, let's go downtown off 2nd and Cesar Chavez, I think.
[01:08:28.504 --> 01:08:35.848]  And let's go to the Worshipful Beto mural that got international attention, the Drudge Report, Link to it and everything else.
[01:08:35.848 --> 01:08:38.110]  So I get there and I'm going to shoot like a three minute video.
[01:08:39.326 --> 01:08:44.411]  Well, a woman comes out of her house and runs over and says, you're not allowed to videotape that.
[01:08:44.411 --> 01:08:48.896]  I'm calling the police on you.
[01:08:48.896 --> 01:08:51.979]  And then it just got crazier from there.
[01:08:53.447 --> 01:09:02.295]  And these leftists are so under mind control that I began fake crying and saying, I love Beto and falling down and worshipping him.
[01:09:02.295 --> 01:09:06.198]  And she began to cry and pat me and go, yes, see, it's good.
[01:09:06.198 --> 01:09:07.999]  It's good.
[01:09:07.999 --> 01:09:09.301]  Good.
[01:09:09.301 --> 01:09:14.025]  These people are out of their minds, man.
[01:09:16.124 --> 01:09:16.785]  Yeah, that's it.
[01:09:16.785 --> 01:09:18.446]  Somebody defiled it.
[01:09:18.446 --> 01:09:19.768]  That's what they call defiling.
[01:09:19.768 --> 01:09:23.311]  It's like defiling a Christian church or a Jewish temple or something.
[01:09:23.311 --> 01:09:24.532]  They defiled it.
[01:09:24.532 --> 01:09:26.374]  Well, someone repainted it and fixed it.
[01:09:26.374 --> 01:09:29.257]  And so the communists didn't like it.
[01:09:29.257 --> 01:09:31.459]  Antifa didn't like it because he's a white guy.
[01:09:31.459 --> 01:09:35.423]  So they said, F you gentrifier, F you white male.
[01:09:35.423 --> 01:09:36.585]  That all got painted over.
[01:09:38.089 --> 01:09:42.213]  And so I'm going to, again, air that coming up later.
[01:09:42.213 --> 01:09:46.077]  I don't want to spend all day on it because I just pretty much did the description of what's coming up.
[01:09:46.077 --> 01:09:47.939]  I'll have to do it again once it comes up.
[01:09:47.939 --> 01:09:50.201]  The President has been speaking for over an hour.
[01:09:50.201 --> 01:09:55.346]  He had a powerful breakdown of what happened in the election last night that I by and large agree with.
[01:09:55.346 --> 01:09:57.608]  And then he's been taking questions for like 45 minutes.
[01:09:57.608 --> 01:10:01.632]  Let's hear a few minutes of this live from the satellite feed from the White House.
[01:10:05.481 --> 01:10:09.022]  And we'll have Roger Stone come here a little bit later.
[01:10:09.022 --> 01:10:10.423]  And here is that audio.
[01:10:10.423 --> 01:10:13.604]  I think it's very good to have you here because the free press and this type of engagement.
[01:10:13.604 --> 01:10:13.884]  I do too.
[01:10:13.884 --> 01:10:15.065]  Actually, I do too.
[01:10:15.065 --> 01:10:15.945]  Yes, it's vital to talk.
[01:10:15.945 --> 01:10:16.745]  It's called earned media.
[01:10:16.745 --> 01:10:17.586]  It's worth billions.
[01:10:17.586 --> 01:10:18.926]  Go ahead.
[01:10:18.926 --> 01:10:21.187]  So, I have two questions for you if that's alright.
[01:10:21.187 --> 01:10:23.028]  It's a rare opportunity.
[01:10:23.028 --> 01:10:26.149]  First, just a point of clarification on the tax returns issue.
[01:10:26.149 --> 01:10:27.029]  You brought up the audit.
[01:10:27.029 --> 01:10:28.770]  That doesn't prevent you from releasing them.
[01:10:28.770 --> 01:10:29.050]  I know.
[01:10:29.050 --> 01:10:29.410]  Oh, sure.
[01:10:29.930 --> 01:10:33.751]  I didn't say it prevented me, I said lawyers will tell you not to do it.
[01:10:33.751 --> 01:10:35.411]  What's your next question?
[01:10:35.411 --> 01:10:36.411]  Come on, let's go.
[01:10:36.411 --> 01:10:37.952]  More exciting question than that, please.
[01:10:37.952 --> 01:10:38.852]  Second one.
[01:10:38.852 --> 01:10:41.673]  Michael Cohen recently said you called black voters stupid.
[01:10:41.673 --> 01:10:42.253]  That's false.
[01:10:42.253 --> 01:10:48.274]  Omarosa has accused you of using the n-word, and the rapper Lil Jon has said you called him Uncle Tom.
[01:10:48.274 --> 01:10:49.134]  What's your response?
[01:10:49.134 --> 01:10:50.535]  I don't know who Lil Jon is.
[01:10:50.535 --> 01:10:51.715]  He was on The Apprentice.
[01:10:51.715 --> 01:10:52.215]  I don't know.
[01:10:52.575 --> 01:10:53.035]  Oh, he was?
[01:10:53.035 --> 01:10:53.376]  Okay.
[01:10:53.376 --> 01:10:53.956]  Oh, I see.
[01:10:53.956 --> 01:10:55.577]  Have you ever made racist remarks?
[01:10:55.577 --> 01:10:58.339]  No, I would never do that, and I don't use racist remarks.
[01:10:58.339 --> 01:10:59.039]  And you know what?
[01:10:59.039 --> 01:11:02.041]  If I did, you people would have known about it.
[01:11:02.041 --> 01:11:04.403]  I've been hearing there are tapes for years and years.
[01:11:04.403 --> 01:11:05.464]  There are tapes.
[01:11:05.464 --> 01:11:08.186]  Number one, I never worried about it because I never did.
[01:11:08.186 --> 01:11:09.546]  I never used racist remarks.
[01:11:09.546 --> 01:11:11.748]  I've never used racist remarks.
[01:11:11.748 --> 01:11:12.148]  Okay.
[01:11:12.148 --> 01:11:13.089]  Well, one point of fact.
[01:11:13.089 --> 01:11:14.049]  Go ahead.
[01:11:14.049 --> 01:11:14.550]  No, no.
[01:11:14.550 --> 01:11:18.312]  One point of fact, because you told her you have the highest approval among African Americans.
[01:11:18.312 --> 01:11:19.133]  Quiet, quiet.
[01:11:19.133 --> 01:11:19.533]  Go ahead.
[01:11:19.533 --> 01:11:19.993]  It's just 8%, sir.
[01:11:19.993 --> 01:11:20.574]  Single digits.
[01:11:21.943 --> 01:11:25.805]  Talk about division.
[01:11:25.805 --> 01:11:27.486]  That's why we've got three satellites.
[01:11:27.486 --> 01:11:28.347]  That was breaking up.
[01:11:28.347 --> 01:11:29.928]  We can go to the other feed.
[01:11:29.928 --> 01:11:31.629]  Oh, we do have Jim Acosta from earlier.
[01:11:31.629 --> 01:11:33.370]  We actually have that ready.
[01:11:33.370 --> 01:11:41.594]  So let's go to that because imagine you've got Michael Cohen who got caught.
[01:11:41.594 --> 01:11:47.337]  He's pled guilty to millions and millions and millions of dollars of tax evasion and then basically covering it up.
[01:11:47.337 --> 01:11:48.218]  So that's money laundering.
[01:11:48.218 --> 01:11:49.659]  That's the real crime.
[01:11:49.659 --> 01:11:49.919]  Okay.
[01:11:52.034 --> 01:11:56.935]  In a company that has nothing to do at all with the President.
[01:11:56.935 --> 01:12:08.558]  And now Mueller has his claws on him, and he comes out and says Trump said black voters are quote, too stupid to vote for me.
[01:12:08.558 --> 01:12:14.779]  Yeah, that's why Trump's been courting African Americans like no one's ever done in the Republican Party since Eisenhower.
[01:12:16.650 --> 01:12:18.851]  Who got 60 plus percent of their vote.
[01:12:18.851 --> 01:12:25.392]  And that's why he in polls is getting 40 percent, almost triple, what any Republican's ever gotten.
[01:12:25.392 --> 01:12:27.873]  It's a load of crap.
[01:12:27.873 --> 01:12:38.675]  So all the rappers loved him, because he had people stay at his house and opened up all his clubs, and is the guy that opened up all these golf courses that black people were barred from.
[01:12:38.675 --> 01:12:42.416]  Forty-five years ago, when Trump became wealthy and started buying stuff up, he opened them up.
[01:12:43.550 --> 01:12:45.732]  And so by doing that, he's the racist.
[01:12:45.732 --> 01:12:47.533]  You see how that crap works?
[01:12:47.533 --> 01:12:58.302]  But if you're Hillary that passed laws to give black people three times longer sentences than white people, or that call black people super predators, then it's okay, you see.
[01:12:58.302 --> 01:13:02.045]  Oh, and she went to the funeral of Robert Byrd at KKK Grand Dragon.
[01:13:02.045 --> 01:13:06.248]  Oh, and she came, she saw Gaddafi died, she destabilized all of Africa.
[01:13:06.248 --> 01:13:09.191]  But that's okay, because the media says she's a good person.
[01:13:10.285 --> 01:13:21.248]  I mean, hell, I've got stacks of news here where it's like, Paul Watson, you know, needs to be shut off YouTube and Twitter and Facebook because the liberal Jewish group in England says he's anti-Semitic.
[01:13:21.248 --> 01:13:24.428]  And you know, Paul's looking into suing them.
[01:13:24.428 --> 01:13:27.089]  Because the racist groups don't like him on either side.
[01:13:27.089 --> 01:13:28.129]  It's total made-up crap.
[01:13:28.129 --> 01:13:28.930]  And he'll win in England.
[01:13:28.930 --> 01:13:30.370]  They have strong libel laws.
[01:13:30.370 --> 01:13:32.410]  So those groups should put on notice.
[01:13:32.410 --> 01:13:33.111]  Okay?
[01:13:33.111 --> 01:13:34.311]  But this is what they do.
[01:13:34.311 --> 01:13:37.792]  You read these articles where they call me anti-Semitic, him anti-Semitic.
[01:13:37.792 --> 01:13:38.952]  They call Trump anti-Semitic.
[01:13:40.339 --> 01:13:43.200]  The Nazis hate Trump because he's the opposite of anti-semitic.
[01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:47.981]  It's a load of crap.
[01:13:47.981 --> 01:13:49.701]  It's a load of crap.
[01:13:49.701 --> 01:14:00.224]  And I know our audience knows that, but these people should politically and financially get in trouble for their ongoing, continued lies.
[01:14:00.224 --> 01:14:01.064]  Let's go to Jim Acosta.
[01:14:01.064 --> 01:14:01.324]  Here it is.
[01:14:02.879 --> 01:14:03.539]  Thank you, Mr. President.
[01:14:03.539 --> 01:14:10.542]  I wanted to challenge you on one of the statements that you made in the tail end of the campaign in the midterms.
[01:14:10.542 --> 01:14:11.963]  Here we go.
[01:14:11.963 --> 01:14:15.885]  Well, if you don't mind, Mr. President, that this caravan was an invasion.
[01:14:15.885 --> 01:14:17.425]  I consider it to be an invasion.
[01:14:17.425 --> 01:14:19.886]  As you know, Mr. President, the caravan was not an invasion.
[01:14:19.886 --> 01:14:25.749]  It's a group of migrants moving up from Central America towards the border with the U.S.
[01:14:25.749 --> 01:14:28.310]  Thank you for telling me that.
[01:14:28.310 --> 01:14:30.251]  Why did you characterize it as such?
[01:14:30.911 --> 01:14:33.253]  Because I consider it an invasion.
[01:14:33.253 --> 01:14:34.574]  You and I have a difference of opinion.
[01:14:34.574 --> 01:14:37.976]  But do you think that you demonized immigrants in this election?
[01:14:37.976 --> 01:14:39.357]  No, not at all.
[01:14:39.357 --> 01:14:42.059]  I want them to come into the country, but they have to come in legally.
[01:14:42.059 --> 01:14:44.461]  You know, they have to come in, Jim, through a process.
[01:14:44.461 --> 01:14:46.062]  I want it to be a process.
[01:14:46.062 --> 01:14:48.164]  And I want people to come in, and we need the people.
[01:14:50.225 --> 01:14:52.146]  You know why we need the people, don't you?
[01:14:52.146 --> 01:14:54.368]  Because we have hundreds of companies moving in.
[01:14:54.368 --> 01:14:55.468]  We need the people.
[01:14:55.468 --> 01:14:59.591]  But your campaign had an ad showing migrants climbing over walls and so on.
[01:14:59.591 --> 01:15:00.712]  Well, that's true.
[01:15:00.712 --> 01:15:01.452]  But they weren't actors.
[01:15:01.452 --> 01:15:02.413]  They're not going to be doing that.
[01:15:02.413 --> 01:15:03.053]  They weren't actors.
[01:15:03.053 --> 01:15:04.314]  Well, no, it's true.
[01:15:04.314 --> 01:15:05.635]  Do you think they were actors?
[01:15:05.635 --> 01:15:06.356]  They weren't actors.
[01:15:06.356 --> 01:15:08.937]  They didn't come from Hollywood.
[01:15:08.937 --> 01:15:10.779]  These were people, this was an actual
[01:15:11.753 --> 01:15:14.474]  You know, it happened a few days ago.
[01:15:14.474 --> 01:15:16.155]  They're hundreds of miles away, though.
[01:15:16.155 --> 01:15:18.076]  They're hundreds and hundreds of miles away.
[01:15:18.076 --> 01:15:19.096]  That's not an invasion.
[01:15:19.096 --> 01:15:21.777]  Honestly, I think you should let me run the country.
[01:15:21.777 --> 01:15:23.298]  They're going to burn America!
[01:15:23.298 --> 01:15:25.899]  And if you did it well, your ratings would be much better.
[01:15:25.899 --> 01:15:27.019]  If I may ask one other question.
[01:15:27.019 --> 01:15:29.060]  Mr. President, if I may ask one other question.
[01:15:29.060 --> 01:15:29.540]  Are you worried?
[01:15:29.540 --> 01:15:30.301]  That's enough.
[01:15:30.301 --> 01:15:30.661]  That's enough.
[01:15:30.661 --> 01:15:32.902]  Mr. President, I was going to ask one of the other folks.
[01:15:32.902 --> 01:15:33.762]  That's enough.
[01:15:33.762 --> 01:15:34.963]  Pardon me, ma'am.
[01:15:34.963 --> 01:15:35.523]  Excuse me.
[01:15:35.523 --> 01:15:36.103]  That's enough.
[01:15:36.103 --> 01:15:37.023]  Mr. President, if I may ask you.
[01:15:39.051 --> 01:15:44.077]  Why the hell do they let... You know, I had White House press passes that Trump had to tell them to give us.
[01:15:44.077 --> 01:15:46.220]  We had them for about a month, and it's not him.
[01:15:46.220 --> 01:15:49.083]  One of the other people took them away.
[01:15:49.083 --> 01:15:51.186]  And we were just going in and asking polite questions.
[01:15:51.186 --> 01:15:55.531]  But instead, that little monster that's anti-free speech is to sit there and crap all over everything.
[01:15:57.219 --> 01:16:03.561]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[01:16:03.561 --> 01:16:06.602]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[01:16:06.602 --> 01:16:12.524]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[01:16:12.524 --> 01:16:16.306]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[01:16:16.306 --> 01:16:17.246]  Was there ever a vote?
[01:16:17.566 --> 01:16:18.586]  Who do we fight for?
[01:16:18.586 --> 01:16:25.108]  The Deep State began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[01:16:25.108 --> 01:16:27.148]  Available at Amazon Books.

[01:17:27.157 --> 01:17:29.338]  You've heard the phrase, you are what you eat?
[01:17:29.338 --> 01:17:30.119]  Not true.
[01:17:30.119 --> 01:17:31.980]  Actually, you are what you can absorb.
[01:17:31.980 --> 01:17:35.962]  So if the vitamins and supplements you now take are not being absorbed, what good are they?
[01:17:35.962 --> 01:17:37.083]  Introducing Protovite.

[01:18:07.972 --> 01:18:15.838]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[01:18:15.838 --> 01:18:19.001]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.

[01:20:18.174 --> 01:20:25.120]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:31.166]  Mother, tell your children not to walk my way.
[01:20:31.166 --> 01:20:36.230]  Tell your children not to hear my words, what they mean, what they say.
[01:20:36.230 --> 01:20:36.731]  Mother.
[01:20:58.935 --> 01:21:00.856]  Welcome back, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:21:00.856 --> 01:21:02.397]  We're here Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.
[01:21:02.397 --> 01:21:02.878]  to 3 p.m.
[01:21:02.878 --> 01:21:04.058]  Central.
[01:21:04.058 --> 01:21:09.422]  All part of the Infowars attack on the globalists and the reboot of America worldwide.
[01:21:11.909 --> 01:21:13.551]  I'm about to see George Soros' false light.
[01:21:13.551 --> 01:21:16.313]  I'll show you what it's like.
[01:21:16.313 --> 01:21:16.894]  Mother!
[01:21:16.894 --> 01:21:24.781]  Alright, let's get serious.
[01:21:46.621 --> 01:21:51.147]  What really happened in the midterms 2018?
[01:21:51.147 --> 01:21:53.750]  What's the big takeaway in my view?
[01:21:53.750 --> 01:21:55.813]  It's this.
[01:21:55.813 --> 01:22:04.885]  Despite the Republican establishment sitting on their hands, obsessing on Fox News and voters they already had,
[01:22:07.073 --> 01:22:30.110]  And despite them letting the Democrats engage in criminal, racketeering-level fraud and censorship against a whole class and groups of people who are nationalists, Christians, conservatives, patriots, and despite all the foreign money and all the foreign meddling and all the Hollywood meddling and not letting Republicans run ads on Facebook and other platforms, despite all that,
[01:22:32.312 --> 01:22:36.916]  We still saw one of the smallest losses of a midterm ever recorded.
[01:22:36.916 --> 01:22:38.297]  In fact, it may be the lowest.
[01:22:38.297 --> 01:22:39.018]  I've got the numbers here.
[01:22:39.018 --> 01:22:44.182]  I can't find a time when it was less seats lost in the House since the Civil War.
[01:22:44.182 --> 01:22:46.564]  And then you get three seats gained in the Senate.
[01:22:46.564 --> 01:22:54.410]  So for a defeat, it's one of the smallest defeats we could have had.
[01:22:54.410 --> 01:22:55.431]  But a defeat is still a defeat.
[01:22:55.431 --> 01:22:56.812]  It's not about our ego.
[01:22:56.812 --> 01:22:58.554]  It's about winning the grand strategy war.
[01:23:00.759 --> 01:23:06.842]  But the big takeaway is, our biggest enemy is not even Nancy Pelosi that doesn't even know what planet she's on.
[01:23:06.842 --> 01:23:11.365]  We'll play a clip of in a moment.
[01:23:11.365 --> 01:23:25.513]  Our enemy is our own selves and the Republican Party leadership, that despite the fact Paul Ryan's leaving, are from another time.
[01:23:25.513 --> 01:23:26.694]  And old people are great.
[01:23:26.694 --> 01:23:28.835]  They can teach a lot of stuff that us young folks don't know.
[01:23:29.906 --> 01:23:39.550]  But when it comes to the internet and it comes to advertising and it comes to all this, they just abandon YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, which is insane.
[01:23:39.550 --> 01:23:50.954]  The audiences on Facebook and Twitter and YouTube for conservative shows, pre-banned, are so gargantuan, I cannot even begin to explain them.
[01:23:50.954 --> 01:23:51.935]  I'm going to say this again.
[01:23:53.243 --> 01:24:04.991]  Google executives, YouTube executives, when they were trying to get me on board with them, five years ago, we have the emails, said, we've done a scan of material with your name and your voice and your information.
[01:24:04.991 --> 01:24:08.354]  They said it's five billion views on YouTube right now.
[01:24:08.354 --> 01:24:10.315]  You've only got about a billion on your channel.
[01:24:10.315 --> 01:24:12.396]  By the time we took it away, it was like two and a half billion.
[01:24:12.396 --> 01:24:14.158]  All our channels together, four billion.
[01:24:14.158 --> 01:24:16.039]  So I don't know what it had grown out there.
[01:24:16.039 --> 01:24:18.380]  Five years later, it was five billion five years ago.
[01:24:19.671 --> 01:24:20.452]  10 billion a day?
[01:24:20.452 --> 01:24:21.313]  I don't know.
[01:24:21.313 --> 01:24:29.180]  We were the biggest political information on YouTube, period.
[01:24:29.180 --> 01:24:31.442]  And they just took that away.
[01:24:31.442 --> 01:24:34.104]  And I was just one piece of it.
[01:24:34.104 --> 01:24:38.568]  There were thousands and thousands of other channels with more views together.
[01:24:38.568 --> 01:24:40.149]  They're all gone.
[01:24:40.149 --> 01:24:41.030]  They're all hunted down.
[01:24:44.011 --> 01:24:53.315]  Until Hillary lost, they only would swap down a few of our videos, but they'd get big in just a few days and then they'd take them down in a week.
[01:24:53.315 --> 01:24:54.976]  We had videos that would just disappear.
[01:24:54.976 --> 01:24:56.377]  We wouldn't get a strike, nothing.
[01:24:56.377 --> 01:25:00.579]  They would have 37 million views, 28 million views, 25 million views.
[01:25:00.579 --> 01:25:04.501]  We're talking dozens of times in the election we had more than 30 million views.
[01:25:04.501 --> 01:25:07.442]  We had hundreds and hundreds of videos with millions of views.
[01:25:09.178 --> 01:25:15.300]  We had billions of views total on all of our Facebooks combined with Paul's.
[01:25:15.300 --> 01:25:19.301]  Billions in just the election.
[01:25:19.301 --> 01:25:24.702]  The day after she loses, they put a governor on there where our biggest videos were 500,000.
[01:25:24.702 --> 01:25:29.763]  They just weren't letting people share them or see them.
[01:25:29.763 --> 01:25:33.484]  So see, the media's like, how'd you like getting banned in August?
[01:25:33.484 --> 01:25:35.125]  No, I got banned in November of 2016.
[01:25:37.523 --> 01:25:39.904]  And proudly, I'm fighting for the globalists.
[01:25:39.904 --> 01:25:41.645]  I'm affected.
[01:25:41.645 --> 01:25:45.986]  The Republicans sit there and literally worship Sean Hannity.
[01:25:45.986 --> 01:25:49.267]  They worship, let's say, the ratings.
[01:25:49.267 --> 01:25:50.308]  I love Sean too.
[01:25:50.308 --> 01:25:52.669]  And people like Lou Dobbs has lower ratings.
[01:25:52.669 --> 01:26:00.012]  He's on Business Channel and very smart people like Tucker Carlson.
[01:26:00.012 --> 01:26:03.293]  But it's still, you're talking four or five million viewers per show.
[01:26:04.378 --> 01:26:08.040]  And you notice it's in the algorithm that Tucker got a few months ago.
[01:26:08.040 --> 01:26:09.660]  What did it say, the number one banned thing?
[01:26:09.660 --> 01:26:12.062]  Alex Jones is in the top of the memo.
[01:26:12.062 --> 01:26:13.282]  Infowars is next.
[01:26:13.282 --> 01:26:16.344]  And then he saw on the list, Tucker Carlson!
[01:26:16.344 --> 01:26:17.344]  Yeah, bro!
[01:26:17.344 --> 01:26:18.124]  Sean Hannity!
[01:26:18.124 --> 01:26:23.687]  You guys used to get 10, 20 million views on your videos.
[01:26:23.687 --> 01:26:25.628]  His biggest video is maybe a half million now.
[01:26:25.628 --> 01:26:27.409]  They've shadow banned you, brother.
[01:26:28.450 --> 01:26:37.513]  And so everyone's sitting there because they're worried about the campaign money that the Republican Party gets and then gives to Fox News and TV channels.
[01:26:37.513 --> 01:26:38.673]  I never wanted the money.
[01:26:38.673 --> 01:26:41.054]  I never tried to get their advertisement.
[01:26:41.054 --> 01:26:43.134]  I wanted freedom for my children.
[01:26:43.134 --> 01:26:46.035]  But the Republican establishment did not want to fight for the Internet.
[01:26:46.035 --> 01:26:54.478]  In fact, they wanted to give it up because they thought it meant more money for the Republican insiders, and that is treason.
[01:26:56.522 --> 01:26:57.443]  You morons!
[01:26:57.443 --> 01:27:08.411]  You'd lose the whole country, and the stock market, and our guns, and our children, because you wanted to make an extra 50 to 100 million dollars in a frickin' election!
[01:27:08.411 --> 01:27:12.535]  Some of you guys deserve to be strung up by your neck until you ain't breathing no more.
[01:27:13.459 --> 01:27:17.842]  And I'm not threatening you, I'm saying that's what treason is, you dumb bastards!
[01:27:17.842 --> 01:27:19.263]  God, you have no vision!
[01:27:19.263 --> 01:27:20.444]  You have no leadership!
[01:27:20.444 --> 01:27:22.105]  You are fools!
[01:27:22.105 --> 01:27:23.727]  You morons!
[01:27:23.727 --> 01:27:26.789]  I tried to get the technology to Trump, I'm not even that good at it!
[01:27:26.789 --> 01:27:32.533]  I could run circles around all those people combined!
[01:27:32.533 --> 01:27:38.758]  Trump ought to go get the top hundred YouTubers, the top hundred Facebooks, he ought to have a command base, a war room, the Democrats have them!
[01:27:39.983 --> 01:27:44.885]  Instead, they made TV shows about how I have war rooms and hundreds of fake news people and all this other crap.
[01:27:44.885 --> 01:27:46.865]  Duplicates of what they've got!
[01:27:46.865 --> 01:27:47.385]  But you know what?
[01:27:47.385 --> 01:27:49.866]  Promoting old-fashioned freedom?
[01:27:49.866 --> 01:27:55.388]  A few dozen people kick their butt because of our millions of listeners who really kick butt.
[01:27:55.388 --> 01:27:56.629]  Our audience won 2016.
[01:27:56.629 --> 01:28:01.090]  Matt Drudge won 2016.
[01:28:01.090 --> 01:28:06.652]  Trump, great personality, great guy, but they convinced him that he could do it alone.
[01:28:07.955 --> 01:28:10.937]  And he can't do it with rallies alone.
[01:28:10.937 --> 01:28:13.138]  And now they're going to get even more censorship.
[01:28:13.138 --> 01:28:13.979]  They've gotten away with it.
[01:28:13.979 --> 01:28:23.345]  They're going to go after all of his supporters, down to the smallest little old lady, or the, you know, black man that owns his own business and does YouTube videos and has hundreds of thousands of views.
[01:28:23.345 --> 01:28:27.967]  They're going to ban everybody, because now they know it kind of worked, but didn't really work.
[01:28:27.967 --> 01:28:30.729]  So the answer for them is going to be, go even crazier.
[01:28:30.729 --> 01:28:36.493]  So the takeaway is, we held them back to a great extent, but they're coming now because they've got a taste of blood.
[01:28:37.273 --> 01:28:43.716]  And you got a bunch of evil Republicans up there siphoning money off at the expense of a whole damn country burning down.
[01:28:43.716 --> 01:28:46.518]  So we better grow up, get our heads screwed on, understand.
[01:28:46.518 --> 01:28:49.900]  The fight for the internet and free speech isn't paramount.
[01:28:49.900 --> 01:28:51.060]  It isn't essential.
[01:28:51.060 --> 01:28:53.902]  It is absolute, total oxygen.
[01:28:53.902 --> 01:28:55.803]  We must retake it now!
[01:28:57.344 --> 01:29:01.185]  Marijuana has unleashed a green gold rush across our nation.
[01:29:01.185 --> 01:29:04.866]  It's creating $10.8 billion in new wealth a year.
[01:29:04.866 --> 01:29:09.647]  And every day, it's transforming more and more Americans into millionaires.
[01:29:09.647 --> 01:29:15.668]  In an historic event, former Speaker of the House John Boehner reveals how you could become one of them.

[01:30:58.439 --> 01:31:01.520]  Our grandparents, the great-grandparents, knew that they canned food.
[01:31:01.520 --> 01:31:03.081]  During the fall, so they'd have it during the winter.
[01:31:04.472 --> 01:31:07.394]  And that's what I'm talking about at InfoWarsTour.com.
[01:31:07.394 --> 01:31:14.399]  With InfoWars Select, it's the full spectrum of my patronage supply, one of the top, most respected companies out there.

[01:31:58.029 --> 01:32:06.413]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or to go for a run or go to the park or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[01:32:06.413 --> 01:32:07.893]  Believe me, I know.
[01:32:07.893 --> 01:32:12.595]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[01:32:12.595 --> 01:32:17.577]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarestore.com, I still have that energy.
[01:32:17.817 --> 01:32:37.968]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[01:32:38.488 --> 01:32:42.470]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.

[01:32:46.152 --> 01:32:51.154]  So I want you to experience Supermail Vitality before it's too late.
[01:32:51.154 --> 01:32:53.875]  Unleash the Supermail in you.
[01:32:53.875 --> 01:33:01.298]  Supermail Vitality from Infowarsstore.com.
[01:33:01.298 --> 01:33:03.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:15.604 --> 01:33:18.125]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[01:33:18.125 --> 01:33:20.887]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:33:20.887 --> 01:33:24.008]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:33:24.008 --> 01:33:24.689]  Okay.
[01:33:24.689 --> 01:33:27.150]  I just broke down.
[01:33:47.458 --> 01:34:03.843]  The criminal activity in the Republican Party, the dereliction of duty that blocked this giant red populist wave that succeeded, as you said, Roger, in the last 22 elections around the world, and that Trump and all of us are riding on.
[01:34:03.843 --> 01:34:05.703]  But we don't feel bad.
[01:34:05.703 --> 01:34:12.185]  The enemy threw everything they had against us here, but we must now get on the offense against them because they've committed some doozies of crimes.
[01:34:13.243 --> 01:34:19.186]  And remember, they want to shut down because they tune in and they get horrified at our intel is precise.
[01:34:19.186 --> 01:34:22.608]  Now, Roger Stone is going to break it all down next segment.
[01:34:22.608 --> 01:34:24.389]  Normally, I'm like, I don't want to hear about Russia collusion.
[01:34:24.389 --> 01:34:25.529]  It's a total canard.
[01:34:25.529 --> 01:34:28.311]  I want to hear about it once it comes to a head.
[01:34:28.311 --> 01:34:29.151]  Well, it's all over the news.
[01:34:29.151 --> 01:34:30.092]  They're indicting you on Friday.
[01:34:30.919 --> 01:34:33.681]  And I know you've got some inside baseball that is world exclusive.
[01:34:33.681 --> 01:34:36.343]  I don't know if you want to get to it in the next segment, but it lets you think about it.
[01:34:36.343 --> 01:34:41.067]  I know you've been thinking about it, but now is the time to be really aware of what Mueller is up to.
[01:34:41.067 --> 01:34:43.869]  And you know, Trump earlier just said it's a total disgrace, all total crap.
[01:34:43.869 --> 01:34:45.870]  So we're going to see where that's all going.
[01:34:45.870 --> 01:34:53.396]  But I did say during the break, and you said this too, Dr. Stone, that we need to get on the offense about the censorship.
[01:34:53.396 --> 01:34:56.798]  And I know everybody heard about censorship for years by YouTube and Google and Facebook and Twitter.
[01:34:58.499 --> 01:34:59.940]  It's moving into people's bank accounts.
[01:34:59.940 --> 01:35:01.781]  It's moving into the Chinese social score.
[01:35:01.781 --> 01:35:04.223]  It's moving into everything everybody does.
[01:35:04.223 --> 01:35:16.872]  And so we have to make this front and center and create the blueprint of how the American people and others can fight back against it or nobody will because the Republican establishment is threatened by new media.
[01:35:17.492 --> 01:35:20.334]  I'm not selling ads to government.
[01:35:20.334 --> 01:35:22.455]  I'm not selling ads to political parties.
[01:35:22.455 --> 01:35:23.755]  But there are people doing it.
[01:35:23.755 --> 01:35:28.378]  And the Blue Bloods are threatened by the Facebook and the Twitter and the Google ads.
[01:35:28.378 --> 01:35:33.360]  So they're more than happy to have that removed from them by the Democrats because they get more money.
[01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:36.862]  You're literally talking about selling the country out for 30 pieces of silver.
[01:35:37.779 --> 01:35:38.980]  No, you're absolutely right, Alex.
[01:35:38.980 --> 01:35:50.770]  The consultant class in Washington, the Karl Rove types, are committed to the old media because the old media made them millions and millions of dollars.
[01:35:50.770 --> 01:35:58.336]  The new media, in which InfoWars is very clearly in the vanguard, was responsible for the election of Donald Trump.
[01:35:58.336 --> 01:36:03.260]  Could not have been done without an open and accessible and free internet.
[01:36:03.720 --> 01:36:18.868]  The ability to target voters on Facebook in these House districts is the single most valuable tool a political strategist can have, because it means you no longer have to pay exorbitant rates for broadcast television, broadcast radio.
[01:36:18.868 --> 01:36:20.469]  It changed the whole game.
[01:36:20.469 --> 01:36:23.491]  The Democrats figured it out, so they took that tool away from us.
[01:36:24.031 --> 01:36:29.935]  If I had to name one technological change that cost us the House, it would be that.
[01:36:29.935 --> 01:36:40.281]  It seems small, but when you're strategizing, you can take $40,000 in a congressional race on Facebook, and you can make it count under the old system.
[01:36:40.281 --> 01:36:44.063]  Now, I can't even post to my own site, the Stone Cold Truth.
[01:36:44.063 --> 01:36:45.484]  They've blocked me out.
[01:36:45.484 --> 01:36:46.044]  Here's the key.
[01:36:46.044 --> 01:36:48.506]  The Democrats are all allowed to do whatever they want, however they want.
[01:36:48.926 --> 01:36:55.870]  Which becomes a campaign finance violation, because Facebook is allowing them entrance into the market, but not allowing you entrance into the market.
[01:36:55.870 --> 01:36:59.232]  And people go, oh, well, you know, they're their own company.
[01:36:59.232 --> 01:37:02.474]  Oh, so now we don't take other people's political ads in newspapers?
[01:37:02.474 --> 01:37:04.055]  We saw this with Faith Goldie.
[01:37:04.055 --> 01:37:09.558]  Wouldn't take her ads on TV, wouldn't take them on radio, wouldn't take them in print, because she was number three in the polls in Toronto.
[01:37:09.558 --> 01:37:15.802]  Most analysts said she would have won, she had the money, young, smart, good looking, if they would have let her advertise.
[01:37:16.802 --> 01:37:25.471]  It is really one of those kind of boring and technological answers to what happened yesterday, but it's not an insignificant answer.
[01:37:25.471 --> 01:37:35.021]  I mean, by all measure, if you look at the loss by the party in power in the House in the first off year, under Clinton, under Bush, under Reagan,
[01:37:35.501 --> 01:37:38.722]  The president really didn't take that big of a hit.
[01:37:38.722 --> 01:37:41.224]  They lost 40 seats, 60 seats.
[01:37:41.224 --> 01:37:43.185]  We lost 30 seats.
[01:37:43.185 --> 01:37:49.007]  And the big wins in the Senate prove that the Trumpian majority is still out there.
[01:37:49.007 --> 01:37:57.591]  Those who really went head to head and took on Trump, like Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota or Joe Donnelly in Indiana, they went face down.
[01:37:57.591 --> 01:37:59.012]  That's the Kavanaugh effect.
[01:37:59.012 --> 01:38:01.513]  And let's be clear, the Kavanaugh effect, the Trump effect show,
[01:38:02.173 --> 01:38:03.834]  Trump is a movement.
[01:38:03.834 --> 01:38:05.455]  He's riding the movement of populism.
[01:38:05.455 --> 01:38:06.536]  He's not a moment.
[01:38:06.536 --> 01:38:09.919]  But there's a new movement, the globalist offensive to crush us.
[01:38:09.919 --> 01:38:12.881]  It's not that the Trump movement isn't real and super powerful.
[01:38:12.881 --> 01:38:13.761]  It's all of your movement.
[01:38:13.761 --> 01:38:14.402]  It's my movement.
[01:38:14.402 --> 01:38:18.565]  It's a global movement for liberty against the old tyranny of the globalist.
[01:38:18.885 --> 01:38:21.046]  It's a global answer to their global tyranny.
[01:38:21.046 --> 01:38:27.867]  The problem is they've launched their worldwide counter-offensive and I think, they're even admitting this right now, Roger, they're trying to act like it was a victory.
[01:38:27.867 --> 01:38:36.190]  The Democrats right now are freaking out that they threw everything they had, massively censored, spent 5 to 1 on average and lost their ass.
[01:38:36.190 --> 01:38:37.050]  They see it as a loss.
[01:38:37.390 --> 01:38:40.392]  There are three model candidates.
[01:38:40.392 --> 01:38:47.176]  Stacey Abrams in Georgia, Beto O'Rourke in Texas, and Andrew Gillum in Florida.
[01:38:47.176 --> 01:38:50.138]  This was supposed to be the future of the Democratic Party.
[01:38:50.138 --> 01:38:53.820]  That was one of the three was going to be the future Obama.
[01:38:53.820 --> 01:38:55.521]  All of them down in flames.
[01:38:55.521 --> 01:38:59.483]  Alex, I can't underestimate the importance of this narrow win in Florida.
[01:38:59.483 --> 01:39:01.985]  Florida is the keystone to Donald Trump's re-election.
[01:39:02.065 --> 01:39:03.886]  Had we lost Florida, that would have been a disaster.
[01:39:03.886 --> 01:39:07.348]  And we're going to talk about it next segment in detail, but exactly.
[01:39:07.348 --> 01:39:13.731]  All three of these people were the beta test for president, vice president, when they launched campaigns in just about a year.
[01:39:13.731 --> 01:39:16.612]  We're now two years out from 2020 election.
[01:39:16.612 --> 01:39:17.552]  And you're exactly right.
[01:39:17.552 --> 01:39:23.375]  This was the, this was the fishery, this was the nursery of them trying to get their next little superstars.
[01:39:23.375 --> 01:39:27.377]  And when the system got fully behind it, that's when it went down in flame.
[01:39:27.377 --> 01:39:29.318]  When they acted like outsider communists,
[01:39:29.838 --> 01:39:33.562]  Like Cortez, they won, which is another scary point we'll get to.
[01:39:33.562 --> 01:39:36.185]  So, my goodness, we are stuck between a rock and a hard place.
[01:39:36.185 --> 01:39:37.206]  We're going to have to fight our way out of it.
[01:39:37.206 --> 01:39:38.708]  We're going to talk about that all in a moment.
[01:39:38.708 --> 01:39:40.229]  But first, let's get to this, Roger.
[01:39:40.229 --> 01:39:42.151]  You had the idea for this.
[01:39:42.151 --> 01:39:47.617]  We delivered 100,000 signatures a year and a half ago to the president.
[01:39:49.156 --> 01:39:49.336]  It's a
[01:40:19.957 --> 01:40:23.320]  I think we're going to hit like 100,000 if we go more than a million.
[01:40:23.320 --> 01:40:26.202]  Maybe his New Jersey estate, maybe we'll hit Mar-a-Lago with 100,000.
[01:40:26.202 --> 01:40:28.884]  WriteTrump.com.
[01:40:28.884 --> 01:40:33.668]  I'm going to hammer the White House with a million of these, okay?
[01:40:33.668 --> 01:40:34.929]  I'm not playing games.
[01:40:34.929 --> 01:40:36.590]  One million, and I know you'll do it.
[01:40:36.590 --> 01:40:38.192]  We did it last time, got 100,000 signatures in a week.
[01:40:40.558 --> 01:40:44.160]  Then we printed him off, and we mailed him, and it showed up, and it was a big fiasco.
[01:40:44.160 --> 01:40:45.120]  I don't like doing this.
[01:40:45.120 --> 01:40:46.061]  I have to do it.
[01:40:46.061 --> 01:40:49.422]  He's going to be knee-deep in these things if you take action.
[01:40:49.422 --> 01:40:51.403]  Write Trump.com.
[01:40:51.403 --> 01:40:52.364]  It's absolutely free.
[01:40:52.364 --> 01:40:56.226]  Sign your name on the letter to the President that we will mail for you directly to the President.
[01:40:57.006 --> 01:41:09.277]  President Trump must understand the importance of putting a stop to this mass censorship of conservatives by big tech and initiate antitrust actions to end this racketeering and collusion by the big tech giants desperate to take back America.
[01:41:09.277 --> 01:41:12.460]  I've already had top law firms write him three briefings.
[01:41:12.460 --> 01:41:14.102]  I've already had them delivered.
[01:41:14.102 --> 01:41:17.945]  I already know that he picked up on, wait, if the EU and the UN
[01:41:19.302 --> 01:41:30.745]  are already regulating our internet because we haven't put regulations on saying there is no regulation, then we've allowed them to come in tacitly or by fiat or by vacuum and begin regulating.
[01:41:30.745 --> 01:41:37.866]  He said that just a few days ago that he's looking at antitrust because especially because the outside powers are coming in and regulating because we're not.
[01:41:37.866 --> 01:41:46.768]  Again, you can have a prohibition regulation that says thou shalt not with US government liability protection to those companies and trade threats back at the enemy.
[01:41:47.368 --> 01:41:50.729]  We've always protected free speech to the internet from the EU, from the shycomps.
[01:41:50.729 --> 01:42:01.152]  Now that Obama removed those protections, it's allowed those to come in so they can come in with fines and regulations to bring our tech DARPA CIA command operation under their control.
[01:42:01.152 --> 01:42:02.272]  That's really what this is all about.
[01:42:02.272 --> 01:42:04.413]  Make no mistake, that's what all these institutions are.
[01:42:04.413 --> 01:42:09.775]  And so we're demanding the president retake control of US hardware in this modern fight.
[01:42:09.775 --> 01:42:11.215]  WriteTrump.com.
[01:42:11.215 --> 01:42:14.216]  Again, we know exactly where to hit the enemy.
[01:42:14.756 --> 01:42:17.258]  Only imperial stormtroopers are so precise.
[01:42:17.258 --> 01:42:18.439]  That's why they hate us.
[01:42:18.439 --> 01:42:23.742]  We're loyal to America, we know what we're doing, and the enemy is completely and absolutely scared.
[01:42:23.742 --> 01:42:27.665]  So go to RightTrump.com today, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:42:27.665 --> 01:42:30.007]  RightTrump.com today.
[01:42:30.007 --> 01:42:32.709]  And don't forget, we have the biggest targeted sale.
[01:42:32.709 --> 01:42:38.273]  Not the biggest general sale, but on six items, it is the biggest sale ever.
[01:42:38.273 --> 01:42:39.534]  67% off a colloidal silver-silver bullet.
[01:42:40.234 --> 01:42:42.537]  A 57% off on Super Melon's Perfume of Vitality.
[01:42:42.537 --> 01:42:44.681]  It's incredible, but I want to move it all.
[01:42:44.681 --> 01:42:45.181]  I'll tell you why.
[01:42:45.181 --> 01:42:47.004]  They're trying to take our payment process and shut us down.
[01:42:47.004 --> 01:42:50.449]  I have to sell out all of our product now before they're successful.
[01:42:50.449 --> 01:42:51.310]  I pray they're not.
[01:42:51.310 --> 01:42:55.897]  We've got to move it all out, the fund, to the next jump phase and new funding I've secured in the new year.
[01:42:58.075 --> 01:43:02.778]  You deserve a deep restful sleep with Knockout by InfoWars Life.

[01:43:57.099 --> 01:44:06.403]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[01:44:06.403 --> 01:44:09.265]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[01:44:09.265 --> 01:44:15.308]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[01:44:15.988 --> 01:44:22.235]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source, and the Globeless tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[01:44:22.235 --> 01:44:28.522]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[01:44:28.522 --> 01:44:35.570]  Now, due to the Establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[01:44:35.570 --> 01:44:35.770]  But!
[01:44:36.591 --> 01:44:49.635]  Chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[01:44:49.635 --> 01:44:53.876]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[01:44:53.876 --> 01:44:56.577]  X3, now available at mfulworthslife.com.
[01:44:58.416 --> 01:45:05.563]  Nourish a probiotic-friendly environment in your gut with Prebiotic Fiber by InfoWars Life.
[01:45:05.563 --> 01:45:17.914]  Help the good bacteria thrive and support overall digestive health with our specially formulated Prebiotic Fiber, a mixture of clinically studied and organic acacia, fruit, and flax fiber.

[01:45:58.189 --> 01:46:02.432]  Please, whatever you do, realize that we're all getting punched drunk to the censorship.
[01:46:02.432 --> 01:46:05.914]  And you saw 18 Twitter accounts, they say, affiliated with InfoWars.
[01:46:05.914 --> 01:46:07.676]  Yeah, some of them are like little side accounts.
[01:46:07.676 --> 01:46:10.718]  They know we had like InfoWars store that just showed our products.
[01:46:10.718 --> 01:46:17.722]  But they just banned them all yesterday in punishment that I be at a Trump rally and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us.
[01:46:17.722 --> 01:46:22.806]  Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from the brick.
[01:46:23.146 --> 01:46:29.248]  But the globalists now want to target where the resistance came from, so that we're not pesky in the future.
[01:46:29.248 --> 01:46:32.229]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[01:46:32.229 --> 01:46:33.329]  I want to keep going.
[01:46:33.329 --> 01:46:37.090]  I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially.
[01:46:37.090 --> 01:46:39.171]  I want to push all the way.
[01:46:39.171 --> 01:46:40.471]  I've committed to do that.
[01:46:40.471 --> 01:46:41.552]  I've prayed for that.
[01:46:41.552 --> 01:46:43.192]  And I've been told that's going to happen.
[01:46:43.192 --> 01:46:45.613]  But you've got to back us, and I promise you this.
[01:46:46.113 --> 01:46:47.235]  I will never falter.
[01:46:47.235 --> 01:46:49.758]  I will never waver at the spiritual level.
[01:46:49.758 --> 01:46:50.719]  I physically will.
[01:46:50.719 --> 01:47:00.851]  But I give you my commitment, if you financially support us, then fullershore.com to give you my absolute total commitment.
[01:47:00.851 --> 01:47:03.474]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:21.144 --> 01:47:27.331]  Folks, we are back live and we're going to plunge into the analysis, the clips, all the facts of what happened.
[01:47:27.331 --> 01:47:30.254]  We couldn't have a better political analyst here with us than Roger Stone.
[01:47:30.254 --> 01:47:35.900]  I want to tackle Russia right now because it's one of the top stories in the country and it's really important, but let me explain something.
[01:47:37.020 --> 01:47:39.142]  I can still get X2.
[01:47:39.142 --> 01:47:48.288]  I was just going to have to pay way more than what I thought the deep-earth crystals were worth from the particular company that was getting them supplied, the very best iodine out there at that time.
[01:47:48.288 --> 01:47:55.493]  So I went around for over a year and found another oil drilling company and another group that supplied pharmaceutical-level iodine.
[01:47:55.493 --> 01:47:56.874]  That's what it is in its raw form.
[01:47:56.874 --> 01:48:01.137]  It's a controlled substance until it gets, you know, broken down into what we sell.
[01:48:02.130 --> 01:48:05.351]  That's how important it is as a controlled element.
[01:48:05.351 --> 01:48:05.992]  Okay?
[01:48:05.992 --> 01:48:11.354]  All the other stuff out there is total garbage, because it's bound, and it's not even real atomic iodine.
[01:48:11.354 --> 01:48:12.955]  This is better than X2.
[01:48:12.955 --> 01:48:14.536]  We still have some X2 available.
[01:48:14.536 --> 01:48:17.137]  It's the last run of it.
[01:48:17.137 --> 01:48:19.998]  When you simply reformulate, you call it something new.
[01:48:19.998 --> 01:48:28.742]  This is the original X2, but the way the chemists and scientists describe it, they say, Mr. Jones, a small percentage of people can't absorb pure atomic iodine.
[01:48:28.742 --> 01:48:29.362]  It is the best.
[01:48:29.362 --> 01:48:30.643]  It goes right into the cells, right in the blood.
[01:48:31.323 --> 01:48:45.312]  A little bit of the other two types of iodine helps it then not bind to something bad like iron or something else but to the atomic iodine and some people upload it better when it's attached to the other iodine.
[01:48:45.312 --> 01:48:47.913]  So it gets into complex stuff that I don't fully understand.
[01:48:48.914 --> 01:48:51.778]  We could, it costs more to put all three types together.
[01:48:51.778 --> 01:48:53.661]  I could have just put all deep-earth crystal.
[01:48:53.661 --> 01:48:59.650]  It's deep-earth crystal, the other two types in a tiny bit, a pure vitamin C that makes it not oxidized.
[01:48:59.650 --> 01:49:01.452]  That's why this is more of a
[01:49:02.679 --> 01:49:03.880]  It's a color I can't describe.
[01:49:03.880 --> 01:49:06.862]  It's like a wild red-orange.
[01:49:06.862 --> 01:49:08.964]  And this is just next level.
[01:49:08.964 --> 01:49:10.945]  It's in two-ounce and one-ounce bottles.
[01:49:10.945 --> 01:49:15.688]  It's 50% off, out of the gates, and free shipping, because I want you to experience it and try it.
[01:49:15.688 --> 01:49:16.809]  Here's a new bottle of it.
[01:49:16.809 --> 01:49:19.932]  When I forget to take my X3 or my X2 before,
[01:49:21.064 --> 01:49:22.905]  I have less energy, I have less stamina.
[01:49:22.905 --> 01:49:30.387]  I've become pretty much a lazy butt because of this, because I like to put it just in a bottle of water or in filtered water and then drink it that way.
[01:49:30.387 --> 01:49:32.408]  Under the tongue is the best.
[01:49:32.408 --> 01:49:39.630]  And I take a regular dose of it and literally, I can be exhausted and three, four hours after I take it, I'm bouncing off the walls.
[01:49:39.630 --> 01:49:46.773]  And it's not listed as a stimulant, even though they use it in the manufacturing of it, it's literally the rocket fuel of the body.
[01:49:47.273 --> 01:49:51.156]  Without iodine, without oxygen, without water, you go bye-bye.
[01:49:51.156 --> 01:49:57.782]  And that's why they bombard you with the bad halogen, fluoride, bromide, chlorine, that whole family.
[01:49:57.782 --> 01:50:00.044]  It literally does the opposite of what iodine does.
[01:50:00.044 --> 01:50:04.308]  So X3, powering the American Revolution, and powering your body, and kicking butt.
[01:50:06.101 --> 01:50:07.502]  It's a great product.
[01:50:07.502 --> 01:50:09.662]  What is your favorite product from InfoWars Live?
[01:50:09.662 --> 01:50:15.305]  I still have to go with Brainforce Plus, Alex, because it gives you mental clarity, mental energy.
[01:50:15.305 --> 01:50:17.725]  It really just kind of helps you pull it together mentally.
[01:50:17.725 --> 01:50:34.292]  When you get that four o'clock in the afternoon dip, you just want to take a nap, you've got so much more work to do, you need to make another video, you need to write another article, you need to do some analysis for InfoWars, but it doesn't jack you up the way, you know, the way the energy drinks do, the way the ephedrine
[01:50:35.252 --> 01:50:36.213]  Laced energy drink.
[01:50:36.213 --> 01:50:37.234]  That's a dirty feeling.
[01:50:37.234 --> 01:50:37.975]  Yeah.
[01:50:37.975 --> 01:50:40.797]  I can drink Aromate and get tons of energy, but I'm a total jerk.
[01:50:40.797 --> 01:50:41.057]  Right.
[01:50:41.057 --> 01:50:43.299]  And then later that night, you're staling at the ceiling.
[01:50:43.299 --> 01:50:44.240]  You can't sleep.
[01:50:44.240 --> 01:50:46.221]  See, BrainForce Plus doesn't do that.
[01:50:46.221 --> 01:50:48.844]  It gives you a nice, subtle lift.
[01:50:48.844 --> 01:50:49.564]  You feel better.
[01:50:49.564 --> 01:50:52.226]  You feel very energized and very focused.
[01:50:52.226 --> 01:50:54.669]  But four hours later, you're not bouncing off the walls.
[01:50:54.669 --> 01:50:57.031]  That's my favorite product without any question.
[01:50:57.031 --> 01:50:58.332]  And it's at a great price right now.
[01:50:58.332 --> 01:51:02.295]  There's over 6,000 satisfied testimonials for BrainForce Plus.
[01:51:02.435 --> 01:51:03.175]  That's right, 5-starred.
[01:51:03.175 --> 01:51:10.660]  And to be clear, there's a little bit of Armani in it, but when I drink a big ol' thing, the first time I was with Pat Riley and my wife, now my wife, and we were at...
[01:51:12.401 --> 01:51:12.881]  What's it called?
[01:51:12.881 --> 01:51:13.702]  Campbell's Hole or whatever.
[01:51:13.702 --> 01:51:16.124]  It's one of those famous underground caves that everybody dies in.
[01:51:16.124 --> 01:51:22.408]  But we weren't going into the hole out in the hill country, this big freshwater, we were just swimming down like 20 feet into it.
[01:51:22.408 --> 01:51:23.429]  And I was like, yeah, I'm tired.
[01:51:23.429 --> 01:51:24.330]  I got a headache.
[01:51:24.330 --> 01:51:24.890]  I'm not sure.
[01:51:24.890 --> 01:51:25.891]  I want to stay out here all day.
[01:51:25.891 --> 01:51:27.852]  And Pat goes, drink this.
[01:51:27.852 --> 01:51:32.696]  And he had Urimati, like rebel berry or whatever it was from Whole Foods, man.
[01:51:32.696 --> 01:51:33.456]  I drank that.
[01:51:33.456 --> 01:51:33.837]  I thought,
[01:51:34.844 --> 01:51:38.386]  So I took methamphetamine like twice in high school and I hated it.
[01:51:38.386 --> 01:51:40.348]  I drank that, I was like, this is like methamphetamine.
[01:51:40.348 --> 01:51:43.450]  My God, how does anybody drink this?
[01:51:43.450 --> 01:51:46.152]  But Brain Force doesn't, it isn't like that.
[01:51:46.152 --> 01:51:48.813]  It has a little bit of Armani, but a bunch of other things.
[01:51:48.813 --> 01:51:55.238]  And the way it's described, it does this chain reaction where you don't feel bad on the stimulant and it's actually good for you.
[01:51:55.238 --> 01:51:56.458]  And then later you can sleep on it.
[01:51:56.458 --> 01:52:01.142]  So it's basically, I don't see a copy of one of the best selling brands in the nation, if we made it better.
[01:52:01.142 --> 01:52:02.763]  The best selling brand in the nation is like 60 bucks.
[01:52:04.005 --> 01:52:06.106]  We sell it for $40.
[01:52:06.106 --> 01:52:08.467]  It's stronger than one of the best-selling brands in the nation.
[01:52:08.467 --> 01:52:09.507]  I'm not a rocket scientist.
[01:52:09.507 --> 01:52:11.768]  Something's the best-selling.
[01:52:11.768 --> 01:52:12.929]  Highly rated.
[01:52:12.929 --> 01:52:14.150]  You know, really, really been tested.
[01:52:14.150 --> 01:52:15.150]  Everybody loves it.
[01:52:15.150 --> 01:52:15.990]  I just make it better.
[01:52:15.990 --> 01:52:17.111]  That's my marketing research.
[01:52:17.111 --> 01:52:18.111]  It's like, well, that's the best.
[01:52:18.111 --> 01:52:20.032]  Let's make it better, and I'll sell it for less.
[01:52:20.032 --> 01:52:21.393]  Again, that kind of is rocket science.
[01:52:21.393 --> 01:52:23.154]  Nobody seems to follow common sense.
[01:52:23.154 --> 01:52:24.874]  That's why Brain Force Plus is amazing.
[01:52:24.874 --> 01:52:28.816]  Now, personally, it gives me so much energy, I can't take it.
[01:52:28.816 --> 01:52:31.617]  Today, I'm on two cups of coffee, and
[01:52:33.158 --> 01:52:35.579]  I'm almost bouncing off the walls more when I'm exhausted.
[01:52:35.579 --> 01:52:41.861]  When I got off air today, though, is when I would pop a Brain Force Plus, like you said, because I will be dragging butt after this.
[01:52:41.861 --> 01:52:42.902]  Yeah, it's a great product.
[01:52:42.902 --> 01:52:46.603]  It's got to be, without any question, my all-time favorite right now.
[01:52:46.603 --> 01:52:49.765]  Free shipping to get in on this incredible opportunity.
[01:52:49.765 --> 01:52:51.225]  Absolutely, and that's how you fund us.
[01:52:51.225 --> 01:52:52.906]  And it's not like we're up here saying we're the tip of the spear.
[01:52:52.906 --> 01:52:55.447]  It's not like we're up here saying, oh my god, they're after us.
[01:52:56.536 --> 01:52:58.198]  Roger, it's not about bragging about us.
[01:52:58.198 --> 01:52:59.279]  Believe me, we're both under attack.
[01:52:59.279 --> 01:53:00.220]  They're trying to put you in prison.
[01:53:00.220 --> 01:53:02.403]  They're trying to destroy me and both.
[01:53:02.403 --> 01:53:04.866]  They hate InfoWars because we've really done the research.
[01:53:04.866 --> 01:53:06.428]  We really know what we're talking about.
[01:53:06.428 --> 01:53:09.932]  And particularly, we have the military.
[01:53:09.932 --> 01:53:11.334]  We have the police.
[01:53:11.334 --> 01:53:15.198]  We have the experts listening because they know we're not BSing.
[01:53:15.999 --> 01:53:23.467]  But this morning you see the headline in Politico, Robert Mueller has important new allies in House Democrat majority.
[01:53:23.467 --> 01:53:25.489]  Really tells the story.
[01:53:25.489 --> 01:53:30.874]  So the whole phony Russian collusion delusion is going to be recycled yet again.
[01:53:30.874 --> 01:53:32.476]  So here comes the reboot.
[01:53:32.476 --> 01:53:37.821]  I know you were pretty, not freaked out, but almost, not even vitriolic, but ready for the challenge last night when you got some news.
[01:53:38.502 --> 01:54:00.336]  Yeah, look, you don't have to go very far to pick up some of the fake news, whether it's Vanity Fair or whether it's Politico or whether it's the Daily Beast or whether it's MSNBC or any of the fake news media to say that Robert Mueller is in hot pursuit of Roger Stone and my indictment is essentially imminent.
[01:54:00.336 --> 01:54:02.057]  I'm not sure that that's true.
[01:54:02.057 --> 01:54:06.460]  If the decision is made on the basis of facts and evidence, no charges will be brought against me.
[01:54:06.980 --> 01:54:13.382]  But the idea that I knew in advance about the content or source of the WikiLeaks disclosures is just false.
[01:54:13.382 --> 01:54:15.822]  It's false whether it is attributed to Randy Credico.
[01:54:15.822 --> 01:54:18.963]  It is false whether it is attributed to Jerry Corsi.
[01:54:18.963 --> 01:54:20.083]  It's a witch hunt.
[01:54:20.083 --> 01:54:21.724]  It's a fairy tale.
[01:54:21.724 --> 01:54:24.264]  If I'm forced to prove it, I will.
[01:54:24.264 --> 01:54:26.525]  But I'm under pressure as never before.
[01:54:26.525 --> 01:54:31.466]  I have had no choice but to form a legal defense fund, StoneDefenseFund.com.
[01:54:31.466 --> 01:54:33.387]  Alex, you're trying to destroy me financially.
[01:54:33.387 --> 01:54:34.567]  You're trying to destroy my family.
[01:54:35.347 --> 01:54:36.428]  And I'm not going to go down without a fight.
[01:54:36.428 --> 01:54:37.749]  By the way, we're not just saying that.
[01:54:37.749 --> 01:54:38.330]  You can see it.
[01:54:38.330 --> 01:54:43.334]  They filed another fake Sandy Hook sit on me this week and said, stop saying it didn't happen.
[01:54:43.334 --> 01:54:45.156]  And for years I've said it was happening.
[01:54:45.156 --> 01:54:47.398]  My listeners questioned it and I did too as an American right.
[01:54:48.166 --> 01:54:49.788]  But again, it's because we're winning.
[01:54:49.788 --> 01:54:50.788]  I don't want to get into it on air.
[01:54:50.788 --> 01:54:51.469]  Make a big deal about it.
[01:54:51.469 --> 01:54:54.412]  We had three lawsuits thrown out in the last two weeks.
[01:54:54.412 --> 01:54:55.353]  So that makes them mad.
[01:54:55.353 --> 01:54:57.335]  They're like, oh my God, America keeps coming back.
[01:54:57.335 --> 01:54:58.996]  And I'm not talking about the families themselves.
[01:54:58.996 --> 01:55:00.818]  I'm talking about the politicos, the Democrats.
[01:55:00.818 --> 01:55:02.199]  But Roger, let's get down to brass tacks.
[01:55:02.199 --> 01:55:03.180]  They want to shut me up.
[01:55:03.180 --> 01:55:04.241]  They want to shut you up.
[01:55:04.241 --> 01:55:05.122]  That's brass tacks.
[01:55:05.122 --> 01:55:09.026]  They want to shut Infowars off the face of the earth because we're a beacon for the truth.
[01:55:09.686 --> 01:55:12.628]  And again, I never ask for money from the Republicans.
[01:55:12.628 --> 01:55:13.628]  I hate the Blue Bloods.
[01:55:13.628 --> 01:55:14.889]  I just want America back.
[01:55:14.889 --> 01:55:22.212]  But the fact that they're all so threatened when they go to a Trump rally and every third t-shirt is an Infowars shirt and I get mobbed like I'm Trump out there.
[01:55:22.212 --> 01:55:34.359]  Instead of them going, hey, we ought to duplicate this or whatever, instead they just turn a blind eye and go, good, if conservatives are cut off, Facebook and Twitter and YouTube, we'll make more money.
[01:55:34.359 --> 01:55:39.101]  We need, worse than Paul Ryan, are the people, and I don't want to be enemies with Karl Rove,
[01:55:39.481 --> 01:55:40.662]  Let me sum it up.
[01:55:40.662 --> 01:55:43.544]  It's not that we're trying to be respectable.
[01:55:43.544 --> 01:55:45.525]  We're trying to be effective.
[01:55:56.272 --> 01:56:00.555]  We will bring you the truth in an audacious way to get it across.
[01:56:00.555 --> 01:56:02.316]  This is about communications.
[01:56:02.316 --> 01:56:04.417]  We're not looking for White House invitations.
[01:56:04.417 --> 01:56:06.179]  We're not looking for cabinet positions.
[01:56:06.179 --> 01:56:09.161]  We're not looking to be part of the Washington buddy system.
[01:56:09.161 --> 01:56:10.461]  We don't care about any of that.
[01:56:10.461 --> 01:56:16.886]  I'm looking to be in my boat with my kids behind me on a wakeboard looking out America's free.
[01:56:17.566 --> 01:56:18.447]  I don't want to be in D.C.
[01:56:18.447 --> 01:56:19.628]  I don't want to be in L.A.
[01:56:19.628 --> 01:56:21.049]  I hate those places.
[01:56:21.049 --> 01:56:22.370]  I want you off my back.
[01:56:22.370 --> 01:56:25.533]  So if I have to give you all the keys to success to get you off my back, I'll do it.
[01:56:25.533 --> 01:56:27.515]  I don't want to be in your dumb club.
[01:56:27.515 --> 01:56:31.058]  Just stop sabotaging things for the Democrats, you idiots!
[01:56:31.058 --> 01:56:31.879]  Gosh, they're stupid!
[01:56:33.421 --> 01:56:38.084]  They have the total keys for taking over, making the Democrats a done party.
[01:56:38.084 --> 01:56:42.226]  We either destroy the Democrats, get this Roger, this is the key to everything.
[01:56:42.226 --> 01:56:44.627]  The Democrats know existentially people are done with them.
[01:56:44.627 --> 01:56:47.028]  They're done, they're dead, they're over politically.
[01:56:47.028 --> 01:56:48.649]  Unless they destroy us.
[01:56:48.649 --> 01:56:53.671]  This is not business as usual for all you senile Republican leaders.
[01:56:53.671 --> 01:56:58.414]  And I'm not bashing old people, I mean they're senile and that these people don't learn new tricks, Roger.
[01:56:59.255 --> 01:57:02.156]  The President deserves enormous credit for coming from behind.
[01:57:02.156 --> 01:57:04.557]  It really was his going on the road and framing the election.
[01:57:04.557 --> 01:57:06.238]  Despite the Republicans' behavior.
[01:57:06.238 --> 01:57:07.859]  And you know they told him not to do it.
[01:57:07.859 --> 01:57:08.639]  You know they did.
[01:57:08.639 --> 01:57:13.821]  But he was very effective on the stump in terms of framing the election and bringing it home.
[01:57:13.821 --> 01:57:16.562]  And the excitement it created online despite the censorship.
[01:57:16.562 --> 01:57:21.585]  The big Senate victory is due to one man, Donald J. Huff.
[01:57:21.585 --> 01:57:22.665]  It's so frustrating.
[01:57:22.665 --> 01:57:24.166]  We're going to go through it all when we come back.
[01:57:25.885 --> 01:57:27.606]  The Mueller thing is just so insane.
[01:57:27.606 --> 01:57:35.870]  Because you were talking about inside the grand jury, what your folks you know told you about the FBI agents are depressed, it's been going on for a year, they've never seen anything like it.
[01:57:35.870 --> 01:57:39.131]  Mueller has to keep it going forever though because he never found anything.
[01:57:39.131 --> 01:57:44.634]  So the search, the bloodhounding continues when he can only look in the mirror at his big, fat, ugly, traitorous face.

[01:59:51.780 --> 01:59:54.421]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:59:59.227 --> 02:00:00.308]  News.
[02:00:00.308 --> 02:00:01.649]  Analysis.
[02:00:01.649 --> 02:00:03.070]  Reports.
[02:00:03.070 --> 02:00:05.592]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:05.592 --> 02:00:09.094]  Sweet dreams are made of this.
[02:00:09.094 --> 02:00:12.717]  Who am I to disagree?
[02:00:12.717 --> 02:00:17.040]  I travel the world and the seven seas.
[02:00:17.040 --> 02:00:20.103]  Everybody is looking for something.
[02:00:24.377 --> 02:00:34.414]  Some of them just want advanced live assistive technologies in over a thousand habitable worlds.
[02:00:35.615 --> 02:00:36.836]  That's what I want.
[02:00:36.836 --> 02:00:43.642]  Kinda got bigger visions than abusing people or being abused or having power over that fetid rat hole that they call D.C.
[02:00:43.642 --> 02:00:45.784]  I mean, I went up there and saw those senators.
[02:00:45.784 --> 02:00:49.066]  They look like mentally retarded mummies.
[02:00:49.066 --> 02:00:53.170]  Especially the Democrats stumbling around like narcissistic sketsis, Roger.
[02:00:55.868 --> 02:01:01.994]  You know, the Republican Party really could have taken it on the chin much worse yesterday if it wasn't for Donald Trump.
[02:01:01.994 --> 02:01:05.518]  They have the most saleable product in the world, and he's succeeded.
[02:01:05.518 --> 02:01:06.939]  And they're ashamed of it!
[02:01:06.939 --> 02:01:09.002]  They were saying, like you said, don't go on the road, sir!
[02:01:10.115 --> 02:01:12.117]  Yeah, it's absolutely true.
[02:01:12.117 --> 02:01:17.761]  This historic win in Florida, by the way, is one of the keystones to the President's re-election.
[02:01:17.761 --> 02:01:21.564]  All of the polls had Andrew Gillum and Bill Nelson leading.
[02:01:21.564 --> 02:01:24.226]  All of the polls were portending disaster.
[02:01:24.226 --> 02:01:29.691]  I had deep concerns because of the most conservative part of the state being wiped out in the hurricane.
[02:01:30.371 --> 02:01:32.673]  Uh, and still, the Republicans pulled through.
[02:01:32.673 --> 02:01:35.915]  This is really, really good news for the President.
[02:01:35.915 --> 02:01:44.700]  Ron DeSantis, an ally of the President, a key figure in the House, uh, in terms of refu- What happened in Broward County that's famous for, uh, spellduggery?
[02:01:44.700 --> 02:01:49.643]  She ended up handing in numbers that, uh, that closed the margin.
[02:01:50.083 --> 02:01:51.584]  But not sufficiently.
[02:01:51.584 --> 02:01:56.589]  And Ron DeSantis, the new governor, and Rick Scott, the current governor, now going to the U.S.
[02:01:56.589 --> 02:01:57.590]  Senate, pulled through.
[02:01:57.590 --> 02:01:58.511]  Let's look at Florida again.
[02:01:58.511 --> 02:02:06.137]  What does it portend that all their darlings they were lining up as beta tests for the president, including Beta Boy here in Texas, fell on their faces?
[02:02:06.778 --> 02:02:13.066]  Well, particularly since, in all honesty, just from a technical point of view, Alex, I think Beto ran a better campaign than Cruz.
[02:02:13.066 --> 02:02:14.748]  Oh my God, he's like the Energizer bunny.
[02:02:14.748 --> 02:02:16.650]  I wish he was that busy making America great.
[02:02:16.650 --> 02:02:19.274]  I thought Gillum ran a better campaign than DeSantis.
[02:02:19.274 --> 02:02:24.100]  I thought Nelson ran a surprisingly good campaign against Scott, even though he was brain dead.
[02:02:24.780 --> 02:02:25.221]  I don't
[02:02:46.138 --> 02:02:46.998]  Oh, there's no doubt.
[02:02:46.998 --> 02:02:54.220]  Everywhere he showed up and put people over the top, he knew where the Democrats were targeting with extra money, he had earned media and he could come block them.
[02:02:54.220 --> 02:02:56.821]  It was like Godzilla facing Megalon.
[02:02:56.821 --> 02:03:00.322]  He like, literally, everywhere Godzilla came out of the ocean, we won.
[02:03:00.322 --> 02:03:02.482]  He's the greatest campaigner in American history.
[02:03:02.482 --> 02:03:03.403]  I mean, he really is.
[02:03:03.403 --> 02:03:06.584]  Reagan was great, Nixon was great, but this guy's incredible.
[02:03:06.584 --> 02:03:07.904]  I don't want to just fawn over Trump.
[02:03:08.424 --> 02:03:10.306]  But we really should be.
[02:03:10.306 --> 02:03:12.648]  People say, oh Jones, you're fawning too much.
[02:03:12.648 --> 02:03:13.588]  What, instead of Hillary?
[02:03:13.588 --> 02:03:18.973]  When they persecute me for my support of him, then he follows through and delivers.
[02:03:18.973 --> 02:03:24.458]  You can't help but then love somebody and get more committed to them like they're your own person.
[02:03:25.558 --> 02:03:27.059]  4.2 million new jobs.
[02:03:27.059 --> 02:03:29.001]  Record wage growth.
[02:03:29.001 --> 02:03:33.424]  The lowest unemployment in American history.
[02:03:33.424 --> 02:03:35.685]  Lowest since 1969.
[02:03:35.685 --> 02:03:42.469]  The lowest unemployment among Hispanic and African Americans since those statistics began being kept.
[02:03:42.469 --> 02:03:44.971]  These things are either true or they are not true.
[02:03:44.971 --> 02:03:45.491]  Stop there.
[02:03:45.491 --> 02:03:46.772]  I'm going to give you the floor.
[02:03:46.772 --> 02:03:48.193]  I want you to talk about Trump himself.
[02:03:49.674 --> 02:03:49.954]  I don't know.
[02:04:10.714 --> 02:04:12.136]  How the hell does he do it?
[02:04:12.136 --> 02:04:23.229]  We're going to come back with Roger Stone, then we're going to open the phones up, get into the campaign, play a bunch of clips, look at all the angles, straight ahead, look at some of the races now coming in in Arizona and California as this historic election closes out.
[02:04:24.346 --> 02:04:25.186]  We dodged a bullet.
[02:04:25.186 --> 02:04:35.529]  The Republican establishment weaning out on advertising online, letting the Democrats block them, letting them censor, letting them bring in all this foreign money.
[02:04:35.529 --> 02:04:37.889]  I thought... I knew we'd win, actually.
[02:04:37.889 --> 02:04:41.830]  We should have won and broken this thing since 1868.
[02:04:41.830 --> 02:04:42.450]  But we didn't.
[02:04:42.450 --> 02:04:47.171]  But we had the lowest loss since then, which is the same thing I was saying.
[02:04:47.171 --> 02:04:50.652]  But if we don't get serious now, we're gonna get crushed in 2020.
[02:04:56.195 --> 02:05:05.483]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[02:05:05.483 --> 02:05:08.346]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[02:05:08.346 --> 02:05:14.392]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best eye out of the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[02:05:15.072 --> 02:05:21.317]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good, but hard to source, and the Globels tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[02:05:21.317 --> 02:05:27.623]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[02:05:27.623 --> 02:05:34.648]  Now, due to the Establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[02:05:34.648 --> 02:05:34.848]  But!
[02:05:35.689 --> 02:05:48.711]  Chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[02:05:48.711 --> 02:05:52.952]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[02:05:52.952 --> 02:05:55.653]  X3, now available at InfoWarsLive.com.
[02:06:08.039 --> 02:06:12.431]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:06:12.431 --> 02:06:14.376]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:32.248 --> 02:06:38.031]  I'm watching the midterms, then you would think our country is Mad Max Thunderdome.
[02:06:38.031 --> 02:06:45.695]  This guy is like, they're coming from Guatemala, they're coming from Mexico.
[02:06:45.695 --> 02:06:47.896]  There's a liberal mob that's coming.
[02:06:47.896 --> 02:06:58.681]  You want to talk?
[02:06:58.681 --> 02:07:00.342]  You want to talk?
[02:07:00.342 --> 02:07:00.943]  Yeah!
[02:07:00.943 --> 02:07:01.703]  You're the president.
[02:07:05.293 --> 02:07:27.570]  And you would think everybody in the country is just like, to the bunker.
[02:07:36.849 --> 02:07:40.310]  We're going to give the number out and start taking your phone calls.
[02:07:40.310 --> 02:07:41.890]  Next segment, actually.
[02:07:41.890 --> 02:07:44.710]  Any election question, comment for Roger Stone.
[02:07:44.710 --> 02:07:47.491]  Taking calls for Roger Stone on the election or Russiagate.
[02:07:47.491 --> 02:07:49.471]  Whatever you want to get into on those subjects with Roger Stone.
[02:07:49.471 --> 02:07:49.531]  877-789-2539.
[02:07:49.531 --> 02:07:49.691]  877-789-Alex.
[02:07:49.691 --> 02:07:49.771]  877-789-2539.
[02:07:49.771 --> 02:07:52.812]  Let's do first-time callers or somebody that was on hold this week or last week.
[02:07:52.812 --> 02:07:54.972]  I know you guys are great and I trust you so.
[02:08:06.254 --> 02:08:11.859]  Just a first-time caller or somebody that's been on hold recently that I didn't get to.
[02:08:11.859 --> 02:08:12.179]  877-789-2539.
[02:08:12.179 --> 02:08:16.702]  It's very nice we have 20 phone lines, but we'll load them all up and I get to like 15 but miss 5.
[02:08:16.702 --> 02:08:19.304]  We're gonna take them.
[02:08:19.304 --> 02:08:20.705]  877-789-ALEX.
[02:08:20.705 --> 02:08:22.967]  All right, Roger, you got caught up in the last break.
[02:08:22.967 --> 02:08:34.896]  Recap the essence of what you see in this election, the essence of Trump, the perfect man at the perfect time in the leading nation in the world where globalism will be decided or
[02:08:35.877 --> 02:08:37.499]  For or against.
[02:08:37.499 --> 02:08:39.741]  Just the magic of what's happening right now.
[02:08:39.741 --> 02:08:41.082]  It's really unbelievable.
[02:08:41.082 --> 02:08:54.753]  And then not just the talk of your indictment, Friday, but the indictment of Donald Trump Jr., which you said months ago, you thought might be them goading them to finally fire Mueller because they believe that will trigger some pre-setup deal.
[02:08:54.753 --> 02:08:55.874]  I don't agree with that.
[02:08:55.874 --> 02:08:57.436]  Everyone's sick of Russiagate.
[02:08:57.436 --> 02:08:58.577]  Everyone's sick of the Clintons.
[02:08:58.577 --> 02:09:00.078]  Everyone's sick of Mueller.
[02:09:00.078 --> 02:09:03.081]  Mueller literally delivers uranium on tarmacs for Uranium One.
[02:09:03.661 --> 02:09:06.344]  It'd be like Hitler presiding over the Nuremberg Trials.
[02:09:06.344 --> 02:09:14.733]  I mean, this is where the KKK, you know, Klansman Grand Dragon... Holding hearings on civil rights.
[02:09:14.733 --> 02:09:17.857]  Yeah, it's just, it's... I guess they did it with Robert Byrd, so why not?
[02:09:18.939 --> 02:09:23.241]  Well, Alex, first of all, let's speak to the election.
[02:09:23.241 --> 02:09:27.803]  As they say when they're doing a financial analysis, the fundamentals here are very solid.
[02:09:27.803 --> 02:09:32.865]  I really think Trump came from way behind, the Republicans came from way behind.
[02:09:32.865 --> 02:09:36.907]  The pre-Kavanaugh deficit really was closed.
[02:09:37.407 --> 02:09:49.131]  An opportunity was presented because the Democrats so completely overreached in their attempt to lynch Kavanaugh the same way they hope to lynch me either this week or next week or soon.
[02:09:49.131 --> 02:09:51.192]  I don't know what the timing may be.
[02:09:51.192 --> 02:09:54.153]  I do know that I have committed no crimes just like you.
[02:09:54.153 --> 02:09:56.094]  There is no Russian collusion.
[02:09:56.934 --> 02:09:58.956]  Trump is a big picture guy.
[02:09:58.956 --> 02:10:00.977]  I mean, I've known him 40 years.
[02:10:00.977 --> 02:10:02.658]  I went to two of his weddings.
[02:10:02.658 --> 02:10:04.379]  He was at my wedding.
[02:10:04.379 --> 02:10:07.641]  I went to the wedding, the wake and the funeral for both of his parents.
[02:10:07.641 --> 02:10:08.681]  I knew them both.
[02:10:08.681 --> 02:10:10.522]  They were great people.
[02:10:10.522 --> 02:10:13.224]  I have great affection for Donald Trump.
[02:10:13.224 --> 02:10:16.386]  Like Ronald Reagan, he's a big picture guy.
[02:10:16.386 --> 02:10:19.067]  He leaves the details to minions.
[02:10:19.067 --> 02:10:22.830]  He sees the big picture and he didn't run for this office.
[02:10:23.370 --> 02:10:25.192]  Because he needed to be president.
[02:10:25.192 --> 02:10:27.836]  He didn't run for this office because he needed to be someone.
[02:10:27.836 --> 02:10:31.321]  He didn't do it because he wanted a bigger plane or a nicer house.
[02:10:31.321 --> 02:10:34.105]  He already had a bigger plane and a nicer house.
[02:10:34.105 --> 02:10:38.951]  This is costing him hundreds of millions of dollars to be president.
[02:10:38.951 --> 02:10:40.133]  They say he's lost about $2 billion.
[02:10:40.493 --> 02:10:42.736]  It's not because he wanted power.
[02:10:42.736 --> 02:10:44.298]  It's not because of the aggrandizement.
[02:10:44.298 --> 02:10:47.723]  He loved America and couldn't see us being screwed.
[02:10:47.723 --> 02:10:52.049]  He finally decided to do this because he couldn't take what was happening to the country anymore.
[02:10:52.049 --> 02:10:53.430]  And he loves his country.
[02:10:53.430 --> 02:10:55.033]  He is, at heart, a patriot.
[02:10:55.713 --> 02:11:05.483]  And he saw what the globalists and the liberals and the Democrats and the two-party political system in Washington was doing to America and he just couldn't stand it anymore.
[02:11:05.483 --> 02:11:08.966]  So he came off the bench at great personal sacrifice.
[02:11:08.966 --> 02:11:12.109]  I can tell you this, he'd rather be playing golf right now.
[02:11:12.109 --> 02:11:15.132]  He'd rather be playing with his grandchildren right now.
[02:11:15.132 --> 02:11:17.214]  He'd rather be at Mar-a-Lago right now.
[02:11:17.958 --> 02:11:25.363]  But instead, the guy is in a grinder where he and his family are under relentless personal attack.
[02:11:25.363 --> 02:11:29.286]  And with the results of yesterday's election, it is only going to get worse.
[02:11:29.286 --> 02:11:34.650]  The House Democrats admit their number one priority is investigating the president.
[02:11:34.650 --> 02:11:35.250]  Think about that.
[02:11:35.250 --> 02:11:39.633]  Subpoena him and everyone he knows and harassing the living hell out of him.
[02:11:39.633 --> 02:11:42.375]  So it is it's almost a joke.
[02:11:42.375 --> 02:11:43.296]  It's so obvious.
[02:11:45.572 --> 02:11:48.897]  The turnabout here is really extraordinary.
[02:11:48.897 --> 02:11:52.742]  Adam Schiff wants to talk about Donald Trump or Roger Stone.
[02:11:52.742 --> 02:12:00.412]  Maybe Congressman Schiff can tell us about his own connections to Ukrainian arms dealers and Ukrainian organized crime and why they're holding fundraisers.
[02:12:00.712 --> 02:12:02.513]  Why don't Republicans go on the attack?
[02:12:02.513 --> 02:12:04.674]  These people are all incredibly guilty.
[02:12:04.674 --> 02:12:10.696]  Maxine Waters swindling tens of millions directly to her own bank account and her husband in a bank bailout.
[02:12:10.696 --> 02:12:14.558]  Schiff and all his corruption with arms dealing and European overthrows in Russia.
[02:12:14.558 --> 02:12:17.379]  Pelosi, billions to her husband's biotech company.
[02:12:17.379 --> 02:12:19.540]  I mean these are knuckle-dragging crooks!
[02:12:20.260 --> 02:12:23.322]  It's extraordinary, but the Republicans have no guts.
[02:12:23.322 --> 02:12:25.103]  That's why you need Nympho Wars.
[02:12:25.103 --> 02:12:26.804]  That's why you need Alex Jones.
[02:12:26.804 --> 02:12:28.745]  That's why you need Roger Stone.
[02:12:28.745 --> 02:12:30.806]  You need us on that wall.
[02:12:30.806 --> 02:12:31.567]  And that's the truth.
[02:12:31.567 --> 02:12:34.488]  Well seriously, I mean, we've tried to grow a pair for the Republicans.
[02:12:34.488 --> 02:12:35.909]  Yeah, it's almost impossible.
[02:12:35.909 --> 02:12:40.872]  The Country Club Republicans, don't get me wrong, they like that we're out here doing this.
[02:12:40.872 --> 02:12:44.494]  They know it benefits the President, but they don't have to get their hands dirty.
[02:12:44.494 --> 02:12:44.814]  Idiots.
[02:12:45.194 --> 02:12:53.928]  That's why I find it somewhat comical that Ben Shapiro, who, when we were first being censored, said, well, Infowars should be censored.
[02:12:53.928 --> 02:12:55.069]  They're irresponsible.
[02:12:55.069 --> 02:12:57.413]  Well, now Ben Shapiro's being censored.
[02:12:57.413 --> 02:12:57.853]  Little Ben.
[02:12:59.073 --> 02:13:03.475]  Don't they get it's a pleasure to get your hands dirty for your freedom and your family in America?
[02:13:03.475 --> 02:13:04.235]  That's what men do?
[02:13:04.235 --> 02:13:05.876]  Unfortunately not.
[02:13:05.876 --> 02:13:09.177]  Look, I think most of these people are in it for themselves.
[02:13:09.177 --> 02:13:10.958]  Let's take Steve Bannon, for example.
[02:13:10.958 --> 02:13:12.119]  Oh my God, what a disgrace.
[02:13:12.119 --> 02:13:22.123]  You know, who knifes the President in the back in the book Fire and Fury, who tries to take credit for the President's victory when only one man elected Donald Trump, and that would be Donald Trump.
[02:13:22.823 --> 02:13:30.433]  Uh, and now meetings with Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted pedophile pimp for Bill and who is Mueller's handler of, of, of kids.
[02:13:30.433 --> 02:13:31.355]  They videotaped it.
[02:13:31.355 --> 02:13:33.217]  I mean, it's, it is, it shows up.
[02:13:33.217 --> 02:13:37.803]  Well, now we know behind the scenes, he's working with Mueller, making contacts to people that have formerly worked here.
[02:13:37.803 --> 02:13:39.485]  Yeah, Ben, and I'm not stupid.
[02:13:39.485 --> 02:13:40.587]  I mean, wow, dude.
[02:13:41.307 --> 02:13:43.229]  Yeah, it really is quite incredible.
[02:13:43.229 --> 02:13:48.232]  And then he goes out to speak on a tour of rallies around the country, and nobody showed up.
[02:13:48.232 --> 02:13:52.935]  As the headline said, Steve Bannon speaking to a crowd of tens.
[02:13:52.935 --> 02:13:54.937]  You know, because it's about you.
[02:13:54.937 --> 02:13:56.297]  You think it's about you.
[02:13:56.297 --> 02:13:57.638]  It's not about you.
[02:13:57.638 --> 02:13:59.780]  It's about the movement.
[02:13:59.780 --> 02:14:10.107]  And the fact that Donald Trump gave Steve Bannon such a high honor, a White House job, which is in my business, like the epitome of... And he dishonorably used it.
[02:14:10.627 --> 02:14:13.511]  To leverage it in traitorous activity.
[02:14:13.511 --> 02:14:19.978]  And to leak to at least two books about how he was the chief strategist who elected Donald Trump.
[02:14:19.978 --> 02:14:20.859]  It was all him.
[02:14:20.859 --> 02:14:22.681]  No dude, it was Donald Trump.
[02:14:22.681 --> 02:14:24.823]  Notice Trump got even better once Bannon was gone.
[02:14:25.404 --> 02:14:27.465]  Look, nobody... I've known Donald Trump 40 years.
[02:14:27.465 --> 02:14:29.187]  You don't put words in his mouth.
[02:14:29.187 --> 02:14:30.207]  It cannot be done.
[02:14:30.207 --> 02:14:31.849]  You don't tell him what to think.
[02:14:31.849 --> 02:14:33.470]  You don't try to tell him what to read.
[02:14:33.470 --> 02:14:35.411]  You don't try to tell him who... No, that's true.
[02:14:35.411 --> 02:14:36.752]  Then why does... It's true.
[02:14:36.752 --> 02:14:40.955]  Why does he love what I put out and what you put out?
[02:14:40.955 --> 02:14:47.420]  No, I think when he sees what we do on Infowars, when it breaks through to him, he knows that we're out here on the point for him.
[02:14:47.420 --> 02:14:51.062]  Who has been more loyal to Donald Trump than Alex Jones?
[02:14:52.043 --> 02:14:53.383]  No one.
[02:14:53.383 --> 02:15:01.985]  When the squeamish were saying after the Billy Bush tape revelations, that's it, it's over, it was Alex who called me and said, don't get all upset.
[02:15:01.985 --> 02:15:04.926]  I'm telling you, three days from now, nobody will remember this.
[02:15:04.926 --> 02:15:07.406]  He turned out to be absolutely right.
[02:15:07.406 --> 02:15:13.588]  So I think the president knows that he has no more loyal supporters than the crew here at InfoWars.
[02:15:13.588 --> 02:15:20.049]  Yeah, we might mildly criticize him, but only to get him to go on the attack and not, and here's the deal.
[02:15:21.090 --> 02:15:28.696]  I know a man by his enemies, and now that he's delivered on so much under this attack, it's absolutely destiny that this is the fight.
[02:15:28.696 --> 02:15:34.400]  The fact that they had such a narrow victory yesterday, despite the treachery inside the Republicans, has scared them.
[02:15:34.400 --> 02:15:37.502]  But I'm telling you, they're going to mobilize now, like you said.
[02:15:37.502 --> 02:15:40.445]  We should talk about that and then go to calls, what the Democrats are going to do now.
[02:15:40.945 --> 02:15:42.867]  And again, I don't think about myself what they're going to do to me.
[02:15:42.867 --> 02:15:43.988]  Literally, because we're all in this together.
[02:15:43.988 --> 02:15:45.770]  But they are coming for us.
[02:15:45.770 --> 02:15:47.892]  So please, don't think the elections are over.
[02:15:47.892 --> 02:15:48.872]  Go to sleep.
[02:15:48.872 --> 02:15:52.135]  Keep spreading the InfoWars.com links, the NewsWars.com links.
[02:15:52.135 --> 02:15:53.517]  Without you, we will be destroyed.

[02:15:57.881 --> 02:15:58.981]  Get back to nature.

[02:16:26.819 --> 02:16:32.203]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[02:16:32.203 --> 02:16:35.106]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[02:16:35.106 --> 02:16:38.688]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.

[02:16:55.211 --> 02:17:01.555]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[02:17:01.555 --> 02:17:04.597]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[02:17:04.597 --> 02:17:10.501]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[02:17:10.501 --> 02:17:14.304]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[02:17:14.304 --> 02:17:15.585]  Was there ever a vote?
[02:17:15.585 --> 02:17:16.906]  Who do we fight for?
[02:17:16.906 --> 02:17:23.110]  The deep state began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[02:17:23.110 --> 02:17:24.551]  Available at Amazon Books.
[02:17:25.351 --> 02:17:26.571]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[02:17:26.571 --> 02:17:30.492]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:17:30.492 --> 02:17:32.013]  I sued the IRS and won.
[02:17:32.013 --> 02:17:34.974]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:17:34.974 --> 02:17:40.535]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[02:17:40.535 --> 02:17:41.736]  I can help you, too.

[02:19:51.491 --> 02:19:55.614]  And with your help spreading it, and with your help downloading it, we are unstoppable.
[02:19:59.313 --> 02:20:16.737]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:16.737 --> 02:20:21.759]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:20:21.759 --> 02:20:24.459]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:20:24.459 --> 02:20:26.380]  You know, there's not a lot of USA's out there.
[02:20:30.217 --> 02:20:34.378]  And when I was growing up, my parents told me how precious America was.
[02:20:34.378 --> 02:20:37.139]  It wasn't perfectly said, but it had a lot of special things about it.
[02:20:37.139 --> 02:20:43.001]  The Magna Carta that led into 1776, and then how precious Texas was.
[02:20:43.001 --> 02:20:53.825]  And quite frankly, I'd roll my eyes when they'd take me to, you know, events at Washington on the Brazos, where Texas was started directly by my ancestors.
[02:20:53.825 --> 02:20:55.826]  But then later when I realized how the rest of the world was,
[02:20:58.697 --> 02:21:03.378]  And now they want to capture us because we are exceptional.
[02:21:03.378 --> 02:21:08.279]  There are people out to enslave us because we have done amazing things.
[02:21:08.279 --> 02:21:10.239]  Then it becomes personal.
[02:21:10.239 --> 02:21:12.499]  And then you look back and you think how stupid you were.
[02:21:12.499 --> 02:21:19.501]  And you realize these young people, Roger, how do we get them excited about America again and believing it's their identity again?
[02:21:19.501 --> 02:21:24.381]  Not because they're in a cult, but because if they're not in the American team, what team are they in?
[02:21:24.381 --> 02:21:27.362]  These big multinationals that have no culture, that have no history?
[02:21:28.305 --> 02:21:34.126]  Part of the problem, of course, Alex, is that young people today don't recognize what they have.
[02:21:34.126 --> 02:21:37.987]  They're so used to freedom that they just take it for granted.
[02:21:37.987 --> 02:21:43.868]  And even while they're being censored on the internet, for example, they don't know they're being censored.
[02:21:43.868 --> 02:21:49.029]  And therefore, they take this great freedom of America totally for granted.
[02:21:49.029 --> 02:21:52.990]  They don't understand that it's being incrementally taken away from them.
[02:21:53.570 --> 02:22:05.077]  We're supposed to be a country that is run under the rule of law, yet the witch hunts that are being conducted now, as David Knight said to me this morning, this is Stalinist!
[02:22:06.170 --> 02:22:17.959]  It's just, it is Stalinist, the fact that the government, because of your political position, can go in and surveil you, look at all your emails, all your text messages, monitor all your phone calls.
[02:22:17.959 --> 02:22:22.622]  And notice, there's not even an apology for three of the four women, three of the five, meaning it's all a lie.
[02:22:22.622 --> 02:22:23.743]  They said, well, it's just political.
[02:22:23.743 --> 02:22:24.824]  I just ruined your life.
[02:22:24.824 --> 02:22:25.304]  Big deal.
[02:22:25.304 --> 02:22:26.986]  And expanding on that, Roger, we're going to go to calls.
[02:22:29.257 --> 02:22:32.038]  Like, Acosta, I'm going to play that clip now.
[02:22:32.038 --> 02:22:38.720]  Acosta, just a few hours ago with the President, an hour and a half ago, said, well, there's no caravan, it's hundreds of miles away, it's not coming.
[02:22:38.720 --> 02:22:50.724]  They're waving foreign flags, they've smashed through multiple borders, they've killed people, they're smuggling children, and then CNN is up there saying, oh, there's nothing happening, there is no caravan, it's not bad.
[02:22:50.724 --> 02:22:58.307]  I mean, everyone should be outraged that that little cockroach would sit there and piss on our face like that and treat us like that.
[02:22:59.152 --> 02:22:59.877]  Here's the exchange.
[02:23:01.352 --> 02:23:01.993]  Thank you, Mr. President.
[02:23:01.993 --> 02:23:09.038]  I want to challenge you on one of the statements that you made in the tail end of the campaign in the midterms.
[02:23:09.038 --> 02:23:10.439]  Here we go.
[02:23:10.439 --> 02:23:14.582]  Well, if you don't mind, Mr. President, that this caravan was an invasion.
[02:23:14.582 --> 02:23:16.183]  I consider it to be an invasion.
[02:23:16.183 --> 02:23:18.384]  As you know, Mr. President, the caravan was not an invasion.
[02:23:18.384 --> 02:23:24.228]  It's a group of migrants moving up from Central America towards the border with the U.S.
[02:23:24.228 --> 02:23:26.810]  Thank you for telling me that.
[02:23:26.810 --> 02:23:28.752]  Why did you characterize it as such?
[02:23:29.392 --> 02:23:31.733]  Because I consider it an invasion.
[02:23:31.733 --> 02:23:33.053]  You and I have a difference of opinion.
[02:23:33.053 --> 02:23:36.474]  But do you think that you demonized immigrants in this election?
[02:23:36.474 --> 02:23:37.335]  No, not at all.
[02:23:37.335 --> 02:23:37.835]  No, not at all.
[02:23:37.835 --> 02:23:40.536]  I want them to come into the country, but they have to come in legally.
[02:23:40.536 --> 02:23:42.937]  You know, they have to come in through a process.
[02:23:42.937 --> 02:23:44.057]  I want it to be a process.
[02:23:44.057 --> 02:23:45.457]  Again, there's an assault on rule of law.
[02:23:45.457 --> 02:23:46.898]  No more due process.
[02:23:46.898 --> 02:23:49.539]  We've got to show license to cross the border, but they don't.
[02:23:51.600 --> 02:23:54.942]  It's really extraordinary, so let me get this straight.
[02:23:54.942 --> 02:24:04.989]  I'm being investigated for the possibility of perjury, yet the three women who came forward just totally made up complete BS about Kavanaugh and potentially ruined his life.
[02:24:04.989 --> 02:24:09.132]  They said that he brutally raped them and rammed their heads into windshields.
[02:24:09.132 --> 02:24:12.374]  But none of them will be prosecuted, that I can guarantee you.
[02:24:12.374 --> 02:24:16.117]  There's a double standard here that really boggles the mind.
[02:24:17.634 --> 02:24:18.635]  They're not going to be doing that.
[02:24:18.635 --> 02:24:19.555]  They weren't actors.
[02:24:19.555 --> 02:24:20.156]  Well, no, it's true.
[02:24:20.156 --> 02:24:21.857]  Do you think they were actors?
[02:24:21.857 --> 02:24:25.079]  Yeah, back this up for a second, because I asked you a question.
[02:24:25.079 --> 02:24:29.322]  Back it up, because Acosta says, though they're hundreds of miles away, they're not coming.
[02:24:29.322 --> 02:24:32.605]  Again, this is the level.
[02:24:32.605 --> 02:24:33.845]  First, they say it's coming.
[02:24:33.845 --> 02:24:34.886]  It's hundreds of thousands.
[02:24:34.886 --> 02:24:36.327]  It's a whole bunch of caravans.
[02:24:36.327 --> 02:24:39.169]  Beto's caught with caravans arriving this week, last week.
[02:24:39.169 --> 02:24:40.450]  It's ongoing.
[02:24:40.450 --> 02:24:43.913]  It's a total invasion, 35 million illegal aliens.
[02:24:43.913 --> 02:24:46.775]  And then he's telling them there's nobody crossing the border, but they are.
[02:24:46.775 --> 02:24:47.115]  Here it is.
[02:24:48.686 --> 02:24:50.287]  I want it to be a process.
[02:24:50.287 --> 02:24:52.448]  And I want people to come in, and we need the people.
[02:24:52.448 --> 02:24:54.469]  Your campaign- Wait, wait, wait.
[02:24:54.469 --> 02:24:56.370]  You know why we need the people, don't you?
[02:24:56.370 --> 02:24:58.611]  Because we have hundreds of companies moving in.
[02:24:58.611 --> 02:24:59.692]  We need the people.
[02:24:59.692 --> 02:25:03.814]  But your campaign had an ad showing migrants climbing over walls and so on.
[02:25:03.814 --> 02:25:04.934]  Well, that's true.
[02:25:04.934 --> 02:25:05.675]  But they weren't actors.
[02:25:05.675 --> 02:25:06.635]  They're not going to be doing that.
[02:25:06.635 --> 02:25:07.716]  They weren't actors.
[02:25:07.716 --> 02:25:08.536]  No, it's true.
[02:25:08.536 --> 02:25:09.857]  Do you think they were actors?
[02:25:09.857 --> 02:25:10.577]  They weren't actors.
[02:25:10.577 --> 02:25:12.398]  They didn't come from Hollywood.
[02:25:12.398 --> 02:25:15.000]  These were people, this was an actual
[02:25:15.976 --> 02:25:18.638]  You know, it happened a few days ago.
[02:25:18.638 --> 02:25:20.379]  They're hundreds of miles away, though.
[02:25:20.379 --> 02:25:22.220]  They're hundreds and hundreds of miles away.
[02:25:22.220 --> 02:25:23.441]  That's not an invasion.
[02:25:23.441 --> 02:25:26.102]  Honestly, I think you should let me run the country.
[02:25:26.102 --> 02:25:27.343]  You run CNN.
[02:25:27.343 --> 02:25:30.125]  And if you did it well, your ratings will be much better.
[02:25:30.125 --> 02:25:31.246]  If I may ask one other question.
[02:25:31.246 --> 02:25:33.287]  Mr. President, if I may ask one other question.
[02:25:33.287 --> 02:25:33.827]  Are you worried?
[02:25:33.827 --> 02:25:34.548]  That's enough.
[02:25:34.548 --> 02:25:34.988]  That's enough.
[02:25:37.950 --> 02:25:39.632]  Because they're hundreds of miles away, it doesn't exist.
[02:25:39.632 --> 02:25:41.575]  He goes, oh, they're fake, huh?
[02:25:41.575 --> 02:25:51.588]  They're waving foreign flags, calling Trump the Antichrist, burning American flags, with kidnapped children admittedly with them, and there's all these...
[02:25:53.724 --> 02:25:55.445]  That's the irony of the left.
[02:25:55.445 --> 02:26:00.768]  They tell us that what we can see with our own eyes, we shouldn't believe.
[02:26:00.768 --> 02:26:08.812]  You can look at the clips right here at Infowars, unfortunately you won't see them at Fox or any place else, but actual footage of the caravans.
[02:26:08.812 --> 02:26:10.413]  You can see the violence.
[02:26:10.413 --> 02:26:12.214]  You can see the vermin.
[02:26:12.214 --> 02:26:16.636]  You can see the ragtag band of criminals headed for our border.
[02:26:17.756 --> 02:26:20.938]  But CNN tells you, no, no, you didn't see any of that.
[02:26:20.938 --> 02:26:27.361]  This is why you need Infowars, in all honesty, to rebut the CNN that are constantly formulating fake news.
[02:26:27.361 --> 02:26:29.322]  There are a lot of folks down there that want to come here legally.
[02:26:29.322 --> 02:26:41.809]  These are organized in UN Soros-funded leftist camps of violent, tough guys, as Trump points out, that are willing to even kill police, fireball them, you name it, and then Jon Stewart makes a joke and says Trump's making it up.
[02:26:41.809 --> 02:26:46.211]  What is this game where they launch these attacks and then tell us it's not happening?
[02:26:46.511 --> 02:26:49.553]  Well, you know who's really good on this with Owen Schroyer?
[02:26:49.553 --> 02:26:51.915]  Who's paying for the flatbed trucks?
[02:26:51.915 --> 02:26:54.036]  Who's paying for the gasoline?
[02:26:54.036 --> 02:26:57.638]  Who's paying to move all the... They admit it's the UN and Soros!
[02:26:57.638 --> 02:26:59.760]  I mean, this stuff costs money!
[02:26:59.760 --> 02:27:02.422]  I'm a political organizer my whole life.
[02:27:02.422 --> 02:27:05.604]  These kind of mass movements of people cost money.
[02:27:05.604 --> 02:27:06.725]  Who's paying for it?
[02:27:06.725 --> 02:27:13.129]  Well, if you tell the truth, that it's George Soros and others of his ilk, then they will try to ban you.
[02:27:13.129 --> 02:27:15.891]  George Soros goes on CBS.
[02:27:16.631 --> 02:27:18.432]  Not Infowars.
[02:27:18.432 --> 02:27:19.512]  CBS instead.
[02:27:19.512 --> 02:27:21.353]  Sure, I was a Nazi collaborator.
[02:27:21.353 --> 02:27:23.454]  Yeah, it was the greatest time of my life.
[02:27:23.454 --> 02:27:25.795]  If I hadn't done it, somebody else would.
[02:27:25.795 --> 02:27:27.076]  You can see the clip.
[02:27:27.076 --> 02:27:33.199]  But when Alex Jones reports it and shows the clip, they accuse Jones of defaming
[02:27:34.019 --> 02:27:39.185]  Soros, they claim it's anti-semitic to our former Nazi collaborator.
[02:27:39.185 --> 02:27:40.667]  Facts are facts.
[02:27:40.667 --> 02:27:44.972]  We're basing our research on a terrific interview on CBS.
[02:27:44.972 --> 02:27:45.973]  Have they refactored it?
[02:27:45.973 --> 02:27:47.194]  And he said it on NPR, too.
[02:27:47.194 --> 02:27:49.197]  It's not like I'm like, oh, my grandfather's in World War II.
[02:27:49.197 --> 02:27:50.458]  They both almost died.
[02:27:50.458 --> 02:27:52.480]  One in a B-17, one in a fighter plane.
[02:27:53.041 --> 02:27:54.201]  They almost both died.
[02:27:54.201 --> 02:27:55.042]  Most of their friends died.
[02:27:55.042 --> 02:27:56.802]  They wouldn't talk about World War II.
[02:27:56.802 --> 02:28:00.043]  My whole family has been like Republican the whole nine yards.
[02:28:00.043 --> 02:28:02.083]  Helped do desegregation in Texas.
[02:28:02.083 --> 02:28:12.246]  And then a little Nazi collaborating guy that says he rejects Jews and Judaism, doesn't believe in Israel, turns around now when he's in trouble and points his finger at me and goes, there's the Nazi.
[02:28:12.246 --> 02:28:17.107]  And then all the leftist Jewish groups bow down to the Nazi and say, yeah, Alex Jones is bad.
[02:28:17.107 --> 02:28:18.247]  Take him off the air, Roger.
[02:28:18.247 --> 02:28:19.307]  That's sick.
[02:28:19.307 --> 02:28:21.608]  So those people have become Nazi collaborators.
[02:28:22.675 --> 02:28:24.056]  It really, it really is.
[02:28:24.056 --> 02:28:25.136]  The facts are the facts.
[02:28:25.136 --> 02:28:27.317]  I ask people to go to see the CBS clip.
[02:28:27.317 --> 02:28:29.258]  I get challenged on this all the time.
[02:28:29.258 --> 02:28:31.519]  You and Jones are smearing Soros.
[02:28:31.519 --> 02:28:33.360]  Look at the CBS interview.
[02:28:33.360 --> 02:28:36.561]  The only person being smeared is us.
[02:28:36.561 --> 02:28:38.122]  Why the hell would he say though?
[02:28:38.122 --> 02:28:39.242]  It was happy making.
[02:28:39.242 --> 02:28:40.523]  Best time of my life.
[02:28:40.523 --> 02:28:41.823]  I feel no regret.
[02:28:41.823 --> 02:28:43.784]  I helped round up Jews.
[02:28:43.784 --> 02:28:44.924]  Welcome to death camp.
[02:28:44.924 --> 02:28:45.825]  May I help you?
[02:28:45.825 --> 02:28:47.906]  I mean, it's like, what the hell?
[02:28:48.967 --> 02:28:52.253]  What is going on with this fruitcake loon bag?
[02:28:52.253 --> 02:28:53.094]  Your calls are coming up.
[02:28:55.492 --> 02:28:56.712]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[02:28:56.712 --> 02:29:00.633]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:29:00.633 --> 02:29:02.174]  I sued the IRS and won.
[02:29:02.174 --> 02:29:05.135]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:29:05.135 --> 02:29:10.676]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[02:29:10.676 --> 02:29:11.876]  I can help you, too.
[02:29:11.876 --> 02:29:14.817]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[02:29:14.817 --> 02:29:17.038]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[02:29:17.038 --> 02:29:21.479]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.

[02:32:59.275 --> 02:33:09.357]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:09.357 --> 02:33:17.119]  Coming to you from the former United States of America, deep in the heart of Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:17.119 --> 02:33:23.080]  I hear people talking bad about the way we have to live here in this country.
[02:33:25.191 --> 02:33:38.436]  Harpin' on wars we fight and gripin' bout the way things ought to be And I don't mind them switchin' sides and standin' up for things they believe in
[02:33:39.810 --> 02:33:47.333]  We're going right to the phone calls.
[02:33:47.333 --> 02:33:59.738]  What Merle Haggard is saying here is, it's one thing if you want to be for communism or something else, but don't want to overthrow the country itself and then think I'm not going to knock you upside the head politically or maybe with something else.
[02:33:59.738 --> 02:34:01.579]  And they keep just pushing this fight they want.
[02:34:04.256 --> 02:34:06.738]  At the same time, everyone is in dangerous territory.
[02:34:06.738 --> 02:34:09.559]  Oh, it reminds me of that great Beatles song, Revolution.
[02:34:09.559 --> 02:34:12.541]  You know, you say you want a revolution, we're all doing what we can.
[02:34:12.541 --> 02:34:17.785]  I mean, it's a rejection of the whole claim of the phony left.
[02:34:17.785 --> 02:34:19.446]  They are the bigots.
[02:34:19.446 --> 02:34:22.428]  They are the anti-Semites.
[02:34:22.428 --> 02:34:24.469]  They are the ones who are intolerant.
[02:34:24.469 --> 02:34:26.690]  They are the ones promoting violence.
[02:34:26.690 --> 02:34:30.112]  They are the ones trying to take away our free speech rights.
[02:34:30.112 --> 02:34:31.974]  They are the haters, not us.
[02:34:32.594 --> 02:34:35.076]  Those things are all repugnant to us.
[02:34:35.076 --> 02:34:45.062]  We believe in total freedom, whether it is freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom to run a business, freedom to sell great products like we do at Infowars.com.
[02:34:45.062 --> 02:34:49.385]  But they, in this mirror glass world, they accuse us of being criminals.
[02:34:49.385 --> 02:35:02.394]  Coming up, I pull up quietly, I'm whispering, because it was for dramatic effect videotaping with my iPhone, the Beto O'Rourke shrine they have in Austin, and a woman comes over and says, you can't videotape that, I'm calling the police.
[02:35:03.335 --> 02:35:04.175]  No, they have it backwards.
[02:35:04.175 --> 02:35:13.722]  We saw that yesterday when Infowarriors caught some people here in Texas in the act of violating election law and ballot fraud.
[02:35:13.722 --> 02:35:23.109]  We had a caller, and when it was videoed, they threatened to arrest him instead of arresting those engaged in the larger crime of ballot fraud.
[02:35:23.109 --> 02:35:23.789]  We're going to go to break.
[02:35:23.789 --> 02:35:27.292]  This is a bombshell that one of our Affiliate Relations guys, Scott, brought up.
[02:35:27.292 --> 02:35:28.773]  And I remember reading this years ago.
[02:35:28.773 --> 02:35:30.114]  It's why 60 Minutes brought it up.
[02:35:30.854 --> 02:35:39.097]  Soros' adoptive father, it's a National Review article, which is basically the right-wing CIA, the truth about George Soros is damning enough.
[02:35:39.097 --> 02:35:50.580]  And then it's got a quote about the following week the kind-hearted Nazi local militia, in an effort to cheer the unhappy lad up, took him off with him to the provinces.
[02:35:50.580 --> 02:35:53.461]  At the time he was working in the Trans
[02:35:54.565 --> 02:35:54.625]  I'm
[02:36:14.690 --> 02:36:18.494]  The alleged godson of Mr. Bofloss.
[02:36:18.494 --> 02:36:21.638]  He even helped with the inventory.
[02:36:21.638 --> 02:36:25.882]  Surrounded by good company, he quickly regained his spirits.
[02:36:25.882 --> 02:36:27.444]  On Saturday, he returned to Budapest.
[02:36:27.444 --> 02:36:36.454]  That's George Soros at a rich Jew's house, taking the property in his adopted father's own memoir.
[02:36:37.589 --> 02:36:43.514]  It's just further proof that Alex Jones, when he said that George Soros was a Nazi collaborator, was right on the money.
[02:36:43.514 --> 02:36:44.915]  Because it came out of his own mouth.
[02:36:44.915 --> 02:36:47.537]  And we've sourced it, but still they smear us.
[02:36:47.537 --> 02:36:54.622]  New York Times headline, uh, philanthropist George Soros conspiracy theories now bleed into mainstream.
[02:36:54.622 --> 02:36:57.064]  Really, New York Times, can you people not read?
[02:36:57.064 --> 02:36:58.505]  Can you not watch television?
[02:36:58.505 --> 02:37:00.926]  Can you not do any really... Well no, they know their line.
[02:37:00.926 --> 02:37:03.769]  It's like when they say Trump hates all Mexicans and there's no clip.
[02:37:04.525 --> 02:37:05.566]  Or Trump said the N-word.
[02:37:05.566 --> 02:37:06.686]  Oh, there's a tape, the N-word.
[02:37:06.686 --> 02:37:07.607]  Oh, where is it?
[02:37:07.607 --> 02:37:08.707]  You know they would have already used it.
[02:37:08.707 --> 02:37:10.268]  It doesn't exist.
[02:37:10.268 --> 02:37:12.650]  He called all Hispanics animals.
[02:37:12.650 --> 02:37:13.590]  That's not what he said.
[02:37:13.590 --> 02:37:15.171]  He was talking about... MS-13.
[02:37:15.171 --> 02:37:15.531]  Right.
[02:37:15.531 --> 02:37:19.954]  I mean, it's a smear game, but nobody holds them to account.
[02:37:19.954 --> 02:37:22.015]  We're held to account, and we make mistakes.
[02:37:22.015 --> 02:37:23.115]  I know our audience knows that.
[02:37:23.115 --> 02:37:23.956]  We're going to get some calls.
[02:37:23.956 --> 02:37:25.477]  We've got loaded phones here.
[02:37:25.477 --> 02:37:29.219]  Man, there are so many people to get to here.
[02:37:29.219 --> 02:37:30.119]  We're going to get to everybody.
[02:37:30.119 --> 02:37:31.440]  We're going to take over Watson's time.
[02:37:31.440 --> 02:37:32.121]  He'll be here with us, too.
[02:37:33.221 --> 02:37:35.943]  Who do we start with here?
[02:37:35.943 --> 02:37:38.304]  Oh yeah, let's talk to Mike in Washington.
[02:37:38.304 --> 02:37:40.385]  The Democrats are coming after the guns.
[02:37:40.385 --> 02:37:42.747]  What happened in Washington, Mike?
[02:37:42.747 --> 02:37:44.387]  Hey, Roger, Alex.
[02:37:44.387 --> 02:37:46.369]  Absolute pleasure to talk to both of you.
[02:37:46.369 --> 02:37:54.673]  Yeah, this is very concerning about this 1639 because the part of it in regards to mental health, I mean, that's a wide open door.
[02:37:54.673 --> 02:37:58.675]  Are they going to come after people that need medical marijuana for ailments?
[02:37:58.675 --> 02:37:59.476]  Are they going to come after
[02:37:59.986 --> 02:38:02.227]  Treatable soldiers with PTSD?
[02:38:02.227 --> 02:38:03.848]  I mean, where are they going to go with this?
[02:38:03.848 --> 02:38:06.350]  Just wanted to get your input on that.
[02:38:06.350 --> 02:38:07.450]  It's a blank check.
[02:38:07.450 --> 02:38:09.071]  We're eating Texas brisket, sorry.
[02:38:09.071 --> 02:38:11.012]  It's a blank check for them to do whatever they want.
[02:38:11.012 --> 02:38:15.275]  They can project whatever they want onto that.
[02:38:15.275 --> 02:38:17.796]  Yeah, it's kind of scary.
[02:38:17.796 --> 02:38:20.838]  I mean, we've had some bad losses in Washington.
[02:38:20.838 --> 02:38:27.662]  Fortunately, we were able to keep Jamie Herrera-Butler, thank God, I believe anyway, last I looked.
[02:38:28.530 --> 02:38:31.911]  But anyway, other than that, I just wanted to say I love you guys.
[02:38:31.911 --> 02:38:32.791]  I love your products.
[02:38:32.791 --> 02:38:35.292]  I have about 10 t-shirts and I'm so close to Portland.
[02:38:35.292 --> 02:38:38.473]  You can imagine how I trigger the libtards over there.
[02:38:38.473 --> 02:38:43.475]  And what happens is under any mafia organization, I predict the super blue areas.
[02:38:43.475 --> 02:38:50.137]  If we end up pushing back, we'll become the reddest because people are sick of living under the tyranny they put up with it.
[02:38:50.137 --> 02:38:52.657]  So only the most extreme take control.
[02:38:52.657 --> 02:38:54.058]  But you asked the question about guns.
[02:38:55.305 --> 02:38:56.728]  The good thing's happening.
[02:38:56.728 --> 02:39:03.663]  Democrats are so emboldened now, all over the country, I can't even keep track of them, from Beto O'Rourke, the lady that lost the governorship.
[02:39:04.835 --> 02:39:08.777]  In Georgia, they're admitting, yeah, get ready for guns to be confiscated.
[02:39:08.777 --> 02:39:10.178]  We're going to take them.
[02:39:10.178 --> 02:39:20.503]  So the fact that they believe their time was coming under Hillary, and now they believe under, you know, this Trump administration, they believe by defeating him, they're being more and more honest.
[02:39:20.503 --> 02:39:24.025]  I mean, Roger, they didn't used to be this honest.
[02:39:24.025 --> 02:39:25.345]  Now they're like, yeah, we're communists.
[02:39:25.345 --> 02:39:26.806]  Yeah, we're going to take your guns.
[02:39:26.806 --> 02:39:29.107]  Yeah, we don't want America to have good trade deals.
[02:39:29.107 --> 02:39:30.288]  We deserve to be bankrupted.
[02:39:31.028 --> 02:39:39.450]  There's a lot of commentary about the nomination and election of an open socialist in the Democratic Party in Queens, New York.
[02:39:39.450 --> 02:39:52.774]  People, I don't think, realize that Cortez defeated Joe Crowley, who was an old-line, machine, white, working-class, traditional liberal Democrat, who should have been unbeatable.
[02:39:53.334 --> 02:39:59.883]  Who was by the way, I don't give a damn if he's white or whatever, I hate these guys, but compared to her, he was actually delivering to people.
[02:39:59.883 --> 02:40:03.609]  So they've now put a person in that doesn't know anything about this.
[02:40:03.609 --> 02:40:05.031]  He was a classic liberal.
[02:40:05.031 --> 02:40:08.475]  We don't agree with him, but he's a decent sort of fellow.
[02:40:09.336 --> 02:40:13.738]  And the fact that she's able to beat someone, that tells you what's happened in the Democratic Party.
[02:40:13.738 --> 02:40:17.059]  There's no room for moderates in the Democratic Party.
[02:40:17.059 --> 02:40:21.221]  There's not even room for classical liberals in the Democratic Party.
[02:40:21.221 --> 02:40:26.664]  The Democratic Party is now the party of Andrew Gillum and Cortez and the Harvard professors.
[02:40:26.664 --> 02:40:27.544]  And I'll make this prediction.
[02:40:27.544 --> 02:40:30.845]  They've been radicalized to open socialists who are really communists.
[02:40:30.845 --> 02:40:32.026]  They're going to be even more radicalized.
[02:40:32.697 --> 02:40:35.318]  Oh, I think this election merely emboldens the left.
[02:40:35.318 --> 02:40:37.559]  Don't get any idea that they feel defeated today.
[02:40:37.559 --> 02:40:38.999]  They're euphoric.
[02:40:38.999 --> 02:40:48.322]  They now have a carte blanche to investigate the president, to issue subpoenas on Roger Stone or Alex Jones or anybody they want.
[02:40:48.322 --> 02:40:54.124]  It is going to be a McCarthyite-style witch hunt like nothing you have ever seen.
[02:40:54.124 --> 02:40:57.125]  If they invite me to come back and testify for the House Intelligence Committee,
[02:40:57.725 --> 02:40:59.545]  I would want to do so in public.
[02:40:59.545 --> 02:41:06.086]  Turn on the TV cameras, because everything I say would be identical to what I said last time, except for I know a little more.
[02:41:06.086 --> 02:41:11.507]  Here's what's so frustrating, why I told you a year and a half ago, shut up, and then I apologize later because it's so serious.
[02:41:11.507 --> 02:41:13.348]  I was in the middle of it!
[02:41:13.348 --> 02:41:15.768]  I was flogging you to get Assange on.
[02:41:15.768 --> 02:41:19.169]  He was all over other channels and pissing on us, not coming on.
[02:41:19.169 --> 02:41:24.750]  Now to claim that we masterminded it all, and he's a Russian, is like saying I'm Pup the Magic Dragon.
[02:41:24.750 --> 02:41:26.010]  God bless you, I appreciate you, caller.
[02:41:26.010 --> 02:41:26.850]  Here's what's going to happen.
[02:41:28.243 --> 02:41:29.085]  I told you I'm taking your calls.
[02:41:29.085 --> 02:41:30.788]  So we're going to go to break.
[02:41:30.788 --> 02:41:33.092]  We're going to take calls for this segment and the next.
[02:41:33.092 --> 02:41:35.236]  I'm going to just bam, bam, bam your calls.
[02:41:35.236 --> 02:41:37.781]  Then Paul Watson's coming up, but I've got to premiere.
[02:41:38.660 --> 02:41:46.306]  The Beto O'Rourke, I just thought I'd go show his mural and talk about how he was synthetic and a fraud and organized by the establishment.
[02:41:46.306 --> 02:41:49.148]  And nothing against his father-in-law is worth $22 billion.
[02:41:49.148 --> 02:41:51.449]  His wife is worth $1.9 billion.
[02:41:51.449 --> 02:41:56.513]  But this whole thing that they're just blue collar and he's Hispanic when he's not, I mean, it's sick.
[02:41:56.513 --> 02:41:58.735]  And the idea that Ted Cruz is fake because
[02:42:00.117 --> 02:42:02.158]  He didn't go with Rafael Cruz.
[02:42:02.158 --> 02:42:04.480]  Well, I don't go with Alexander Jones.
[02:42:04.480 --> 02:42:05.801]  I mean, you know, you don't want to.
[02:42:05.801 --> 02:42:10.844]  So this whole thing Cruz didn't make it about being, quote, Hispanic or Spanish background.
[02:42:10.844 --> 02:42:13.767]  He made it about being pro-America and his great voting record.
[02:42:13.767 --> 02:42:15.508]  So it really, really, really, really angers me.
[02:42:15.508 --> 02:42:18.790]  So we're going to air that at six after and then Paul Watts is going to take over.
[02:42:18.790 --> 02:42:20.411]  But I'm going to your calls.
[02:42:20.411 --> 02:42:21.372]  Laser beam focus.
[02:42:21.372 --> 02:42:21.812]  I promise.
[02:42:21.812 --> 02:42:22.433]  Bam, bam, bam.
[02:42:22.433 --> 02:42:23.934]  But one minute each with.
[02:42:24.594 --> 02:42:32.680]  The great Roger Stone, and then Roger Stone's going to be a little bit in the war room today, then he's flying out of here, but pray for him because he's a tough cookie, but they're coming after him.
[02:42:32.680 --> 02:42:34.862]  Because they need somebody to hang Russia collusion around.
[02:42:34.862 --> 02:42:37.864]  They need somebody to say, there's the bad man.
[02:42:37.864 --> 02:42:38.364]  Look at him.
[02:42:38.364 --> 02:42:41.026]  He helped round up Russians in the 80s.
[02:42:41.026 --> 02:42:42.507]  He worked for Nixon.
[02:42:42.507 --> 02:42:43.568]  He worked for Reagan.
[02:42:43.568 --> 02:42:44.609]  He's a super right-winger.
[02:42:44.609 --> 02:42:46.150]  He works for the right-wing Cubans.
[02:42:46.150 --> 02:42:50.233]  He's married to a right-wing Cuban woman whose dad helped lead the revolution against Castro.
[02:42:50.233 --> 02:42:51.554]  He can't be trusted.
[02:42:51.554 --> 02:42:53.476]  The anti-communist is now the commie.
[02:42:55.365 --> 02:43:03.748]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym, or to go for a run, or go to the park, or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[02:43:03.748 --> 02:43:05.208]  Believe me, I know.
[02:43:05.208 --> 02:43:09.909]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[02:43:09.909 --> 02:43:14.891]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com, I still have that energy.
[02:43:15.151 --> 02:43:35.315]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[02:43:35.815 --> 02:43:39.800]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.

[02:44:57.020 --> 02:45:01.825]  We need to go back and revisit the foundations of our freedom.
[02:45:03.536 --> 02:45:06.657]  Our freedoms don't consist of the things that are enumerated on a piece of paper.
[02:45:06.657 --> 02:45:09.339]  It consists of the things that we're willing to fight for.
[02:45:09.339 --> 02:45:13.640]  The First Amendment, the Bill of Rights, the rest of the Bill of Rights are prohibitions.
[02:45:13.640 --> 02:45:21.124]  They're prohibitions against powerful organizations and individuals taking those God-given rights from us as individuals.
[02:45:21.124 --> 02:45:23.545]  You better understand that, because they're taking them right now.
[02:45:26.974 --> 02:45:29.195]  We have seen what they want to do.
[02:45:29.195 --> 02:45:32.636]  They called it UN Agenda 21, now they call it the UN 2030 Agenda.
[02:45:32.636 --> 02:45:44.140]  They want everybody off of the rural lands, they want people out of the suburbs, they want to pack everybody into the cities, because that's where it is easiest for them to control everyone.
[02:45:44.140 --> 02:45:45.720]  It's the David Knight Show!
[02:45:45.720 --> 02:45:48.521]  Never miss your show, any day.
[02:45:56.334 --> 02:46:00.577]  Please, whatever you do, realize that we're all getting punched drunk to the censorship.
[02:46:00.577 --> 02:46:04.039]  And you saw 18 Twitter accounts, they say, affiliated with InfoWars.
[02:46:04.039 --> 02:46:05.800]  Yeah, some of them are like little side accounts.
[02:46:05.800 --> 02:46:09.082]  They know we had like InfoWars store that just showed our products.
[02:46:09.082 --> 02:46:15.866]  But they just banned them all yesterday in punishment that I be at a Trump rally and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us.
[02:46:15.866 --> 02:46:20.949]  Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from the brink.
[02:46:21.269 --> 02:46:27.372]  But the globalists now want to target where the resistance came from, so that we're not pesky in the future.
[02:46:27.372 --> 02:46:30.353]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[02:46:30.353 --> 02:46:31.474]  I want to keep going.
[02:46:31.474 --> 02:46:35.295]  I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially.
[02:46:35.295 --> 02:46:37.296]  I want to push all the way.
[02:46:37.296 --> 02:46:38.597]  I've committed to do that.
[02:46:38.597 --> 02:46:41.318]  I've prayed for that, and I've been told that's going to happen.
[02:46:41.318 --> 02:46:43.759]  But you've got to back us, and I promise you this.
[02:46:44.239 --> 02:46:45.380]  I will never falter.
[02:46:45.380 --> 02:46:47.903]  I will never waver at the spiritual level.
[02:46:47.903 --> 02:46:48.844]  I physically will.
[02:46:48.844 --> 02:46:59.294]  But I give you my commitment, if you financially support us, and 4Wars4.com to give you my absolute total commitment.
[02:46:59.294 --> 02:47:01.937]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:29.700 --> 02:47:47.723]  Ladies and gentlemen, exactly as Roger Stone predicted a month ago and last night, he said if you want to change the subject, Mr. President, he said it right towards the end of our broadcast when Owen and the rest of the crew took over, he said you must fire
[02:47:49.059 --> 02:48:04.134]  Sessions and Rosenstein to change the narrative from the election loss, which was barely a loss, which is still a loss, but it shows that if we didn't have treason, we would have won and bucked the 160-year rule.
[02:48:04.134 --> 02:48:07.578]  We are pleased to announce that Matthew G. Whitaker
[02:48:09.022 --> 02:48:14.606]  Chief of Staff Attorney General Jeff Sessions at the Department of Justice will become our new Acting Attorney General of the United States.
[02:48:14.606 --> 02:48:16.688]  He will serve our country well.
[02:48:16.688 --> 02:48:20.030]  So Trump said, November 7th, sanctions begin.
[02:48:20.030 --> 02:48:23.813]  We thank Attorney General Jeff Sessions for his service and wish him well.
[02:48:23.813 --> 02:48:27.776]  A permanent replacement will be nominated at a later date.
[02:48:27.776 --> 02:48:30.497]  This will be a day long remembered.
[02:48:30.497 --> 02:48:31.979]  Listen, it's not about us predicting it.
[02:48:32.779 --> 02:48:35.243]  But I even told him to make that headline last night off the live show.
[02:48:35.243 --> 02:48:35.944]  I don't know if he did.
[02:48:35.944 --> 02:48:38.649]  We have a limited crew that are maxed out, so I love them.
[02:48:38.649 --> 02:48:45.139]  I said, Roger Stone puts out an emergency message to Trump of changing the narrative and firing the deep state.
[02:48:45.139 --> 02:48:46.762]  We've got maximum alert.
[02:48:48.154 --> 02:48:49.074]  In fact, I'm not even leaving now.
[02:48:49.074 --> 02:48:52.856]  Paul Watts is coming up, and he's awesome, but I'll close with him.
[02:48:52.856 --> 02:49:03.760]  Get to last night, the last 20 minutes, and you say over and over and over again, he must change the narrative tonight or tomorrow.
[02:49:03.760 --> 02:49:05.141]  He must fire them.
[02:49:05.141 --> 02:49:07.382]  Roger Stone, former Chief Advisor to the President.
[02:49:08.444 --> 02:49:12.166]  Well Alex, I see this now one for two.
[02:49:12.166 --> 02:49:16.007]  The president has done the right thing in firing Jeff Sessions.
[02:49:16.007 --> 02:49:21.329]  I don't know Mr. Whitaker, but I hope he will be better than Mr. Sessions.
[02:49:21.329 --> 02:49:22.310]  Give me his bio.
[02:49:22.310 --> 02:49:30.293]  Now he must fire Rod Rosenstein, the seditious weasel, who the New York Times reported was caught
[02:49:31.033 --> 02:49:39.016]  Proposing that he wear a wire to entrap the President of the United States in order to remove him under the 25th Amendment.
[02:49:39.016 --> 02:49:45.999]  Mr. Rosenstein also said it would be no problem because the Secret Service never checks my cell phone when I meet with the President.
[02:49:45.999 --> 02:49:49.340]  Then NBC, Ken Delaney tried to say, oh, he was only joking.
[02:49:49.340 --> 02:49:50.440]  No, that wasn't a joke.
[02:49:50.440 --> 02:49:54.902]  Why would you talk about the logistics of how to do it if it were just a joke?
[02:49:54.902 --> 02:49:55.682]  It is no joke.
[02:49:55.682 --> 02:49:57.683]  We know they're traitors, so he's listening.
[02:49:57.683 --> 02:49:59.624]  The Pentagon's listening.
[02:50:00.629 --> 02:50:02.513]  Director of Central Intelligence is listening.
[02:50:02.513 --> 02:50:03.476]  They respect you, Roger.
[02:50:03.476 --> 02:50:05.701]  They're obviously on top of it.
[02:50:05.701 --> 02:50:07.926]  What do you say and how do you think the enemy will strike back?
[02:50:09.103 --> 02:50:21.186]  Well, this is just going to further motivate the Democrats to soup up their investigation of the president, may move Mr. Mueller to step up with the indictment of Donald Trump Jr.
[02:50:21.186 --> 02:50:29.668]  I predicted this, the possible prosecution of Donald Trump Jr., about a month ago, six weeks ago.
[02:50:29.668 --> 02:50:33.809]  Then my sources came back to me and said, no, it would not be in connection with
[02:50:34.309 --> 02:50:36.251]  Lying to an investigation.
[02:50:36.251 --> 02:50:45.537]  It would be in connection with approving the payment from the Trump Family Trust to Michael Cohen for the reimbursement, allegedly, of Stormy Daniels.
[02:50:45.537 --> 02:50:49.140]  We issued a retraction right here on the air at InfoWars.
[02:50:49.140 --> 02:50:52.983]  We make mistakes from time to time, but when we do, we own up to them and we correct them.
[02:50:53.183 --> 02:50:57.185]  Well no, they're gunning for the indictment, we just had the wrong point.
[02:50:57.185 --> 02:50:58.106]  And maybe we didn't.
[02:50:58.106 --> 02:51:10.073]  According to today's news, several stories that are up, Donald Trump Jr., who I like very much, may be under the gun for allegedly misleading investigators.
[02:51:10.073 --> 02:51:15.256]  I've been in this particular situation, where they say stuff about you that isn't true.
[02:51:15.256 --> 02:51:15.937]  I've got your problem.
[02:51:15.937 --> 02:51:16.697]  Let's move on.
[02:51:18.198 --> 02:51:30.623]  Again, in the last 30 minutes of the show, and I'm going to have it, we have a great crew, last night's show, I forget the exact headline I gave, if they can pull up last night's logs, I go back to their embrace and give headlines for videos and articles.
[02:51:31.687 --> 02:51:32.368]  What did you say?
[02:51:32.368 --> 02:51:44.176]  Because I remember you specifically said, if Trump wants to change the narrative, if Trump wants victory, he must fire Sessions and Rosenstein tonight or tomorrow.
[02:51:44.176 --> 02:51:47.999]  And it's now, because Rosenstein can't be too far behind.
[02:51:47.999 --> 02:51:50.961]  Two things that you heard here on Infowars you didn't hear anyplace else.
[02:51:51.821 --> 02:51:54.983]  I predicted that we would lose the House.
[02:51:54.983 --> 02:51:56.804]  I did so sadly.
[02:51:56.804 --> 02:51:59.065]  Some of my colleagues here told me that I was wrong.
[02:51:59.065 --> 02:51:59.925]  You did it Monday.
[02:51:59.925 --> 02:52:01.926]  Owen Schroer owes me a steak.
[02:52:01.926 --> 02:52:04.948]  Now he's suddenly talking about the new steak burger at McDonald's.
[02:52:04.948 --> 02:52:05.528]  No dude owes me a steak.
[02:52:05.528 --> 02:52:06.589]  I didn't tell you you were wrong.
[02:52:06.589 --> 02:52:07.309]  I said I hope you're wrong.
[02:52:07.989 --> 02:52:12.252]  You were more pessimistic as I was, but we brought you that news.
[02:52:12.252 --> 02:52:22.977]  And last night I very clearly said, while the Democrats don't, before they could even have a chance for their victory dance, the President could change the entire narrative by firing Sessions and Rosenstein.
[02:52:22.977 --> 02:52:27.019]  So I think the message is like an emergency message, Roger Stone, Alex Jones.
[02:52:27.019 --> 02:52:27.960]  I love the crew.
[02:52:27.960 --> 02:52:29.100]  Can somebody tell me the name?
[02:52:29.100 --> 02:52:30.141]  Look, I'll watch it.
[02:52:30.141 --> 02:52:35.864]  Just cue up the last 30 minutes of the show last night, before we left, like, you say you have it?
[02:52:37.861 --> 02:52:38.441]  We're queuing it up.
[02:52:38.441 --> 02:52:39.242]  Okay, they already found it.
[02:52:39.242 --> 02:52:39.822]  Incredible.
[02:52:39.822 --> 02:52:41.043]  Keep going.
[02:52:41.043 --> 02:52:47.066]  So, look, this is a president who now understands that he's under siege.
[02:52:47.066 --> 02:52:54.549]  This is a president who understands that Deep State isn't just coming for Roger Stone, isn't just coming for Donald Trump Jr., isn't just coming for Alex Jones.
[02:52:54.549 --> 02:52:55.750]  They're coming for him.
[02:52:55.750 --> 02:52:57.251]  This is about him.
[02:52:57.251 --> 02:53:00.952]  His reform agenda so completely threatens the political status quo.
[02:53:00.952 --> 02:53:03.414]  Because they suck just trying to build the world government!
[02:53:03.414 --> 02:53:05.815]  You're not holding back Americans, you jerk-offs!
[02:53:06.155 --> 02:53:08.477]  So, uh, we're in for a rumble, folks.
[02:53:08.477 --> 02:53:12.481]  This is going to be a hell of a fight, but... And they think we're dumb because we're loyal.
[02:53:12.481 --> 02:53:17.265]  No, we're strong because we know how to bet on something and stick with it.
[02:53:17.265 --> 02:53:19.587]  I know how to be some chicken crap weasel.
[02:53:19.587 --> 02:53:22.269]  You think I want to be some chicken crap disloyal weasel?
[02:53:22.269 --> 02:53:24.091]  I'm so sick of all these weasels!
[02:53:26.209 --> 02:53:30.370]  Well, I do think there's going to be further housecleaning by the President.
[02:53:42.634 --> 02:53:46.055]  I do think he's going to terminate more of the deep staters around him.
[02:53:46.055 --> 02:53:51.818]  I think he is, from what I am told, he's completely fed up with the Mueller investigation.
[02:53:51.818 --> 02:53:54.419]  He's fed up of the witch hunt nature of it.
[02:53:54.419 --> 02:53:56.480]  He sees it for exactly what it is.
[02:53:56.480 --> 02:53:59.461]  That's why I think Mr. Mueller may be rushing to wrap this up.
[02:53:59.961 --> 02:54:07.027]  Whether or not he terminates Mr. Mueller, I have no knowledge, no information.
[02:54:07.027 --> 02:54:14.773]  I do know the left would like that because, you see, then they could claim, ah, it's the Saturday Night Massacre, Trump is doing this to cover up Russian collusion.
[02:54:14.773 --> 02:54:15.373]  No!
[02:54:15.373 --> 02:54:17.094]  There is no evidence of Russian collusion.
[02:54:17.094 --> 02:54:17.755]  Other than Democrats.
[02:54:17.995 --> 02:54:19.036]  It's a canard.
[02:54:19.036 --> 02:54:20.278]  It's a fairy tale.
[02:54:20.278 --> 02:54:28.767]  It's an invented tale to distract from the fact that we caught them, red-handed, using FISA warrants, which now, you ask me what he needs to do?
[02:54:28.767 --> 02:54:30.169]  That's what he needs to do.
[02:54:30.169 --> 02:54:32.231]  Declassify the FISA warrants.
[02:54:32.231 --> 02:54:34.794]  When they tell you, Mr. President... Oh, he said, you heard him today.
[02:54:34.794 --> 02:54:36.937]  We played the clip live during the press conference.
[02:54:36.937 --> 02:54:38.318]  He said they're so scared of this.
[02:54:39.278 --> 02:54:41.639]  Sir, fire at will.
[02:54:41.639 --> 02:54:42.459]  America's behind you.
[02:54:42.459 --> 02:54:44.160]  We want leadership.
[02:54:44.160 --> 02:54:45.801]  We understand restraint.
[02:54:45.801 --> 02:54:47.582]  But we're ready to back you, sir.
[02:54:47.582 --> 02:54:50.203]  We're ready to back the Donalds.
[02:54:50.981 --> 02:54:52.321]  We're ready to back him, aren't we?
[02:54:52.321 --> 02:54:52.821]  Absolutely.
[02:54:52.821 --> 02:55:03.684]  Look, when they tell him, Mr. President, the British and the Australians object to your declassifying these documents, that's not because they're legitimately concerned about exposing their methods and sources.
[02:55:03.684 --> 02:55:13.007]  They're legitimately concerned about exposing the fact that they were helping the CIA and the NSA spy on Donald Trump, as my friend Judge Andrew Napolitano correctly pointed out.
[02:55:13.007 --> 02:55:14.607]  Which has all been confirmed.
[02:55:14.607 --> 02:55:15.467]  So, here's the deal.
[02:55:15.467 --> 02:55:17.868]  You've got traitors that sold the country out.
[02:55:18.959 --> 02:55:34.183]  Working with foreign powers, claiming that known super patriots like Donald Trump, Roger Stone, and Alex Jones, and I'm not bragging, but I'll tell you my bona fides, it goes ridiculously, it's ridiculous, okay?
[02:55:34.183 --> 02:55:39.645]  So the whole point is, is that they all know you cannot get more thoroughbred America than me.
[02:55:39.645 --> 02:55:41.285]  It doesn't exist, okay?
[02:55:41.285 --> 02:55:42.686]  It does not exist.
[02:55:42.686 --> 02:55:45.607]  And so the claims of all this against us are one,
[02:55:46.904 --> 02:55:49.763]  Infinity times a trillion, garbage.
[02:55:50.737 --> 02:55:55.578]  And so that's all I'm telling you is you want prosperity, you want freedom, you want it, you got to be able to deal with it.
[02:55:55.578 --> 02:55:57.479]  This is an incredible time to be alive.
[02:55:57.479 --> 02:55:58.459]  The next hour is coming up.
[02:55:58.459 --> 02:55:59.360]  I'll bring Watson in.
[02:55:59.360 --> 02:56:04.581]  I was going to air this Beto thing, but almost making fun of some leftist poor weasel is almost not even worth it.
[02:56:04.581 --> 02:56:10.803]  We'll post the video to Infowars.com right now because it's just in such a moment as in beginning to fire Sessions.
[02:56:10.803 --> 02:56:16.345]  Everything we've wanted and all the fake QAnon people telling us, oh, Sessions is good.
[02:56:16.345 --> 02:56:16.465]  No.
[02:56:17.245 --> 02:56:18.866]  No, no, no.
[02:56:18.866 --> 02:56:23.788]  The President told me Sessions and people like McCain are pieces of crap a year and a half ago.
[02:56:23.788 --> 02:56:25.388]  But don't worry, they'll be dealt with.
[02:56:25.388 --> 02:56:33.392]  It's now happening, ladies and gentlemen, and let's get ready for it because I believe, for whatever reason after this election, President Trump's taking the gloves off.
[02:56:33.392 --> 02:56:33.872]  Roger Stone.
[02:56:34.372 --> 02:56:36.695]  This may very well be Trump Unchained.
[02:56:36.695 --> 02:56:38.397]  Now you may see the real Donald Trump.
[02:56:38.397 --> 02:56:41.481]  The one you just saw slapping Jim Acosta back.
[02:56:41.481 --> 02:56:42.883]  That was the Trump that I know.
[02:56:42.883 --> 02:56:44.886]  That was the Trump that I love.
[02:56:44.886 --> 02:56:47.149]  This guy doesn't brook any nonsense.
[02:56:47.149 --> 02:56:48.370]  That's what I love about him.
[02:56:48.370 --> 02:56:51.855]  So get ready for Donald Trump Unchained.
[02:56:51.855 --> 02:56:52.456]  God, I'm ready.
[02:56:53.772 --> 02:56:58.314]  Compared, like, how are we ruled by people like Pelosi and Hillary?
[02:56:58.314 --> 02:57:06.056]  These hunchback, demon bloodsuckers who have a problem with success because it makes them feel small.
[02:57:06.056 --> 02:57:07.097]  What is wrong with them, Roger?
[02:57:07.097 --> 02:57:09.258]  They don't feel big, but they're people's success.
[02:57:09.258 --> 02:57:11.138]  I don't understand this.
[02:57:11.138 --> 02:57:13.539]  Well, it's the Democratic Party today.
[02:57:13.539 --> 02:57:16.480]  It just summed up in the opposition, their whole platform.
[02:57:16.480 --> 02:57:17.861]  We hate Donald Trump.
[02:57:17.861 --> 02:57:21.202]  No plan for jobs, no plan for the economy, no plan for America.
[02:57:22.774 --> 02:57:24.495]  Alright, I said I'd take calls.
[02:57:24.495 --> 02:57:25.396]  I had you all call in.
[02:57:25.396 --> 02:57:26.557]  I'm not trying to disrespect you.
[02:57:26.557 --> 02:57:28.038]  Big news breaks like this.
[02:57:28.038 --> 02:57:28.819]  I'll see what happens.
[02:57:28.819 --> 02:57:31.161]  I gotta take a two minute break and figure out what I'm gonna do right now.
[02:57:31.161 --> 02:57:32.382]  This is so epic.
[02:57:32.382 --> 02:57:34.984]  Roger, you literally... I'm not just saying this to kiss your ass.
[02:57:34.984 --> 02:57:37.546]  You keep calling everything dead on.
[02:57:37.546 --> 02:57:38.326]  We're gonna come back.
[02:57:38.326 --> 02:57:39.847]  Can we come with that Van Halen song?
[02:57:39.847 --> 02:57:40.608]  I'll wait.
[02:57:40.608 --> 02:57:41.649]  We're gonna come back with Van Halen.

[03:00:02.648 --> 03:00:11.773]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones!

[03:00:28.302 --> 03:00:33.325]  But we've got, we've got these forces that want to enslave humanity defeated.
[03:00:33.325 --> 03:00:37.007]  And then openly, ask everybody else, do you want the success?
[03:00:37.007 --> 03:00:38.208]  Come with the West.

[03:00:53.815 --> 03:01:01.197]  Roger, you predicted that Trump, you said he should fire Sessions today.
[03:01:01.197 --> 03:01:02.177]  You said it last night.
[03:01:02.177 --> 03:01:04.738]  The videos on Infowars.com are going to play at the next segment.
[03:01:04.738 --> 03:01:06.058]  Then Paul Watts is taking over.
[03:01:06.058 --> 03:01:08.339]  I apologize to the callers, but here's the breaking news.
[03:01:08.339 --> 03:01:09.819]  They understand.
[03:01:09.819 --> 03:01:12.240]  No disrespect.
[03:01:12.240 --> 03:01:13.320]  Tell us what comes next.
[03:01:14.614 --> 03:01:21.301]  Next, the most logical thing, Alex, would be the declassification of the FISA warrants.
[03:01:21.301 --> 03:01:32.713]  This busts the phony Russia collusion thing wide open and puts the focus back on the real crime, which is the use of abuse of power under the Obama administration to hijack the last election.
[03:01:33.294 --> 03:01:42.658]  This is something far worse than Watergate in which they use the authority and capability of the state to surveil the top aides of Donald Trump and most likely Trump himself.
[03:01:42.658 --> 03:01:52.362]  And as you said January 20th, 2017 with me in DC, you said, they did it, it's illegal, it is the heart of bringing them down, Trump must do this or be destroyed.
[03:01:52.362 --> 03:02:00.105]  And now, as you said to me privately last night at 1am back there, repeat it, you said, I think Trump's taking the gloves off.
[03:02:00.325 --> 03:02:01.226]  There's no question.
[03:02:01.226 --> 03:02:06.873]  And this is not only is the... And he doesn't want to do it!
[03:02:06.873 --> 03:02:07.915]  But he has to do it!
[03:02:07.915 --> 03:02:17.266]  Not only is it just that the termination of Jeff Sessions is the right move, but Matthew Whitaker, the new acting Attorney General, is a conservative activist!
[03:02:18.107 --> 03:02:25.177]  He's a former executive director of the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust, a conservative non-profit.
[03:02:25.177 --> 03:02:29.483]  This guy ran twice for state office as a conservative Republican in Iowa.
[03:02:29.483 --> 03:02:32.728]  This is not some inside the beltway dipshit.
[03:02:32.728 --> 03:02:33.509]  Pardon me, dip.
[03:02:34.630 --> 03:02:41.897]  This guy looks to me like he is going to be a real... So this guy isn't a brown noser with crap running down his legs?
[03:02:41.897 --> 03:02:45.900]  No, and I think he's committed to the rule of law and real justice.
[03:02:45.900 --> 03:02:52.746]  And perhaps he will now rein in the out-of-control leaking investigation of Robert Mueller.
[03:02:52.746 --> 03:02:57.851]  All of these leaks that you read about Roger Stone in the newspaper, they are illegal, Alex.
[03:02:57.851 --> 03:03:01.034]  And they also use the classified leak to put lies in it.
[03:03:02.834 --> 03:03:10.421]  We know, because you were with me, according to the New York Times on January 20th, 2017, I was under surveillance in 2016.
[03:03:10.421 --> 03:03:12.203]  What was the probable cause?
[03:03:12.203 --> 03:03:15.066]  Don't say contact with Julian Assange because I didn't have any.
[03:03:15.066 --> 03:03:17.668]  Look, everyone knows it's horse crap.
[03:03:17.668 --> 03:03:21.512]  When we come back, though, we're going to play this clip of you predicting this last night and calling for it.
[03:03:22.824 --> 03:03:24.805]  And that's why they metaphysically get so upset.
[03:03:24.805 --> 03:03:29.906]  I'm there, we're going in, you know, to the VIP area below the president for a speech.
[03:03:29.906 --> 03:03:34.988]  And I laid out, he was going to call in the birthright, he was going to say the power goes back to the people.
[03:03:34.988 --> 03:03:38.929]  And the New York Times walked up to me and they wrote an article and they said, did you see the speech?
[03:03:38.929 --> 03:03:40.569]  And he was shaking.
[03:03:40.569 --> 03:03:44.531]  And I said, no, it's kind of like the internet of the spirit.
[03:03:44.531 --> 03:03:45.151]  You don't get it.
[03:03:45.151 --> 03:03:46.971]  And that's why they're so pissed.
[03:03:46.971 --> 03:03:48.972]  They didn't know what to do.
[03:03:48.972 --> 03:03:50.132]  They got so scared.
[03:03:50.132 --> 03:03:51.773]  Why do you think we're so synced up with the president?
[03:03:53.029 --> 03:03:55.950]  Well, because we're for America and he's for America.
[03:03:55.950 --> 03:04:02.014]  We're not trying to be inside the beltway insiders.
[03:04:02.014 --> 03:04:05.755]  We're not looking for appointments or patronage or jobs.
[03:04:05.755 --> 03:04:10.178]  We just want to save this country for our children, for our grandchildren.
[03:04:10.178 --> 03:04:13.439]  Donald Trump didn't run for president because of an ego trip.
[03:04:13.439 --> 03:04:16.701]  He didn't run for president to aggrandize himself and make his name bigger.
[03:04:16.701 --> 03:04:19.482]  His name was already the biggest name in the planet.
[03:04:19.482 --> 03:04:22.664]  He was the best known businessman literally in the world.
[03:04:22.984 --> 03:04:28.428]  I mean, he did this for America, the same reason that Alex and I are doing it.
[03:04:28.428 --> 03:04:29.329]  For our country.
[03:04:29.329 --> 03:04:30.750]  It certainly isn't for the money.
[03:04:30.750 --> 03:04:32.451]  But let's admit it.
[03:04:32.451 --> 03:04:35.474]  He did it for the animated contest.
[03:04:35.474 --> 03:04:38.616]  There's nothing like fighting evil toe-to-toe.
[03:04:38.616 --> 03:04:45.941]  When we come back, ladies and gentlemen, Roger called the shots last night, and then Paul Watson from London, England, takes over.
[03:04:45.941 --> 03:04:47.763]  This is the Infowar.
[03:04:47.763 --> 03:04:51.506]  This is destiny, and this is everything we've sacrificed for.
[03:04:54.164 --> 03:05:03.451]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[03:05:03.451 --> 03:05:06.313]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[03:05:06.313 --> 03:05:12.358]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[03:05:13.038 --> 03:05:19.281]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source, and the Globals tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[03:05:19.281 --> 03:05:25.584]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[03:05:25.584 --> 03:05:32.507]  Now, due to the Establisher trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[03:05:33.667 --> 03:05:46.671]  Chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[03:05:46.671 --> 03:05:50.932]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[03:05:50.932 --> 03:05:53.633]  X3, now available at emploreslife.com.
[03:06:05.561 --> 03:06:12.006]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:15.714 --> 03:06:18.555]  First of all, we need to clean house.
[03:06:18.555 --> 03:06:24.936]  He should fire Jeff Sessions and Rod Rosenstein and clean house at his Justice Department.
[03:06:24.936 --> 03:06:40.280]  He should give his new acting Attorney General a direct order to file antitrust actions to end the racketeering and the collusion of the tech giants to silence not just InfoWars, it's not just about us, we just happen to be the
[03:06:40.580 --> 03:06:41.141]  Cutting edge.
[03:06:41.141 --> 03:06:51.712]  Now let's be clear, it's not just the right thing to do, it's also a way to change the narrative from the squeamish, anemic victory the Democrats just had, thanks to Republican ineptness.
[03:06:51.712 --> 03:06:55.056]  He needs to, tomorrow, fire them to change the narrative.
[03:06:55.056 --> 03:06:59.481]  Well, and here's a direct action that all of our listeners and viewers can take immediately.
[03:07:00.101 --> 03:07:07.887]  We have set up a new program to deliver, hopefully, millions of letters to the president where we will pay the postage.
[03:07:07.887 --> 03:07:10.429]  You send us the letter, we will post it.
[03:07:10.429 --> 03:07:13.612]  Alex Jones will deliver these to the post office personally.
[03:07:13.612 --> 03:07:15.093]  Well, let's be clear.
[03:07:15.093 --> 03:07:19.636]  We did this a year and a half ago and got 100,000 plus and made the president make a major move.
[03:07:19.636 --> 03:07:22.078]  He said just days ago he's looking at antitrust.
[03:07:22.078 --> 03:07:26.622]  We had lawyers write up the actual plans that he's actually adopting because everybody else is too scared to do it.
[03:07:26.622 --> 03:07:29.083]  WriteTrump.com will
[03:07:30.083 --> 03:07:39.758]  If you have a copy of the letter you can print off that's signed, you can send, and we guarantee we're going to send it, it's own letter, and I'll do a stunt where I deliver like 20 bags of it.
[03:07:39.758 --> 03:07:43.042]  We're going to hit the White House with a million of these babies.
[03:07:43.042 --> 03:07:44.485]  This is so important.
[03:07:45.506 --> 03:07:46.507]  That's just one clip.
[03:07:46.507 --> 03:07:47.689]  The crew did a great job of finding it.
[03:07:47.689 --> 03:07:49.691]  There's a longer clip where you lay it all out for like 10 minutes.
[03:07:49.691 --> 03:07:50.873]  We'll find it and put it out.
[03:07:50.873 --> 03:07:53.316]  Paul Watson about to take over, obviously, for the next 50 minutes.
[03:07:53.316 --> 03:08:03.648]  And then the war room's coming up and you're going to be flying back to Florida and you're facing false indictment by the Russian agent, Robert Mueller, literally, who delivers uranium on the tarmac.
[03:08:05.134 --> 03:08:10.678]  The fact that you said this would be the right decisive move to fire him and then Rosenstein.
[03:08:10.678 --> 03:08:14.121]  Roger, you told us what was going to happen last night, as you've done so many times.
[03:08:14.121 --> 03:08:15.762]  You've got like a 98% accuracy rate.
[03:08:15.762 --> 03:08:19.685]  As a former chief advisor to the president, you guys click so much.
[03:08:19.685 --> 03:08:20.906]  What do you think is coming next?
[03:08:22.432 --> 03:08:25.154]  I think you're looking at declassification of the FISA warrants.
[03:08:25.154 --> 03:08:37.184]  That makes the entire, puts the onus back on the Obama criminals and the criminality of the Obama Justice Department and their collusion with the Hillary Clinton campaign to hijack the last election.
[03:08:37.184 --> 03:08:41.227]  This is the insurance policy that Peter Strzok spoke of in his text messages.
[03:08:42.207 --> 03:09:01.859]  You may have missed it, but in a historic interview with George Papadopoulos here, Alex Jones heard Papadopoulos reveal that in May of 2016, he was being approached by FBI operatives seeking to plant faux evidence of Russian collusion on him.
[03:09:01.859 --> 03:09:04.321]  How interesting that this is the exact same period
[03:09:04.821 --> 03:09:16.406]  In which Stefan Halper, veteran FBI and CIA informant and operative, paid over $1 million by the CIA, was reaching out to Carter Page.
[03:09:16.406 --> 03:09:24.529]  This is the same period in which a strange man named Henry Greenberg reached out to me through my colleague Michael Caputo.
[03:09:24.529 --> 03:09:31.152]  I granted the guy a 20 minute meeting and he tried to entrap me and compromise the President of the United States.
[03:09:31.792 --> 03:09:34.934]  He turns out to be an FBI informant.
[03:09:34.934 --> 03:09:43.261]  The use of human assets in an investigation prior to the opening of a former investigation is illegal.
[03:09:43.261 --> 03:09:46.023]  But this is what they're seeking to cover up.
[03:09:46.023 --> 03:09:49.285]  That's why they keep pointing to the non-existent Russian collusion.
[03:09:49.285 --> 03:09:52.288]  This shows that the president is now ready to go thermonuclear.
[03:09:53.188 --> 03:09:54.990]  It certainly is an early indication of it.
[03:09:54.990 --> 03:10:02.436]  I think it's a huge indication, but let's not be too... How, well really just give us your first approximation, that's always the deepest.
[03:10:02.436 --> 03:10:04.618]  As the President says, what's shallow is deep.
[03:10:04.618 --> 03:10:05.339]  How do they strike back?
[03:10:06.489 --> 03:10:15.155]  Oh, you're going to see them start harping about the President's taxes, and I fear they're going to roll out charges against Donald Trump Jr.
[03:10:15.155 --> 03:10:15.595]  That's right.
[03:10:15.595 --> 03:10:18.797]  There's multiple stories about this yesterday and today.
[03:10:18.797 --> 03:10:21.519]  You can see them at the Drudge Report.
[03:10:21.519 --> 03:10:24.220]  America is going to reject this, though.
[03:10:24.220 --> 03:10:28.483]  So they're trying to piss the President off to get him to act too provocatively.
[03:10:28.483 --> 03:10:32.806]  Maybe he's gotten word they're about to indict Donald Jr., because that's what this looks like with Sessions out.
[03:10:34.277 --> 03:10:35.518]  That's entirely possible.
[03:10:35.518 --> 03:10:40.822]  I have no inside knowledge of it, but he's been on the hit list, as I have.
[03:10:40.822 --> 03:10:47.747]  And there was a piece yesterday, Matt Drudge had it up on Vanity Fair by Gabriel Sherman, who says it boils down to Roger Stone and Donald Trump.
[03:10:47.747 --> 03:10:57.314]  By the way, we were talking last night, and I finally got home and looked for it, and obviously buried it because it was so powerful, but it was in Stars and Stripes, the Washington Post article, where you have two witnesses
[03:10:58.712 --> 03:11:04.116]  I remember two years ago, or 26 months ago during the campaign, I'm like, can you get me Assange?
[03:11:04.116 --> 03:11:05.497]  He's like, John Assange is a jerk.
[03:11:05.497 --> 03:11:08.820]  I don't know why he goes to the New York Times and everybody else, not us.
[03:11:08.820 --> 03:11:11.842]  I know a New York talk show host, I've never said the guy's name, that knows him.
[03:11:11.842 --> 03:11:14.104]  He says it's damning, but they already said it was damning.
[03:11:14.104 --> 03:11:16.406]  So everything you're saying, I've already, was there.
[03:11:16.406 --> 03:11:17.507]  Everyone was here.
[03:11:17.507 --> 03:11:19.208]  I mean, we were sending emails to Assange.
[03:11:19.208 --> 03:11:20.889]  He was not giving us the time of day.
[03:11:20.889 --> 03:11:22.030]  Everybody else could have him on.
[03:11:22.030 --> 03:11:23.752]  Us talking to him means we're Russian agents.
[03:11:24.392 --> 03:11:36.756]  And then they said in the article, well, you had two witnesses, a filmmaker who's famous and, you know, works with Oliver Stone, and another lawyer.
[03:11:36.756 --> 03:11:38.056]  You hypnotized them.
[03:11:38.056 --> 03:11:40.217]  Now you're Ka from The Jungle Book.
[03:11:40.217 --> 03:11:42.797]  And you told me that, I didn't believe it, last night at like 2 a.m.
[03:11:42.797 --> 03:11:50.059]  I'm in bed with my iPad and I'm reading this that you, that mullers, they're saying you hypnotize people.
[03:11:50.059 --> 03:11:52.040]  Next you like have lightsabers and stuff.
[03:11:52.600 --> 03:11:58.665]  Yeah, so now that Randy Credico, that guy has, I think, pretty much discredited himself because he's lying and I'm telling the truth.
[03:11:58.665 --> 03:12:00.146]  So they moved on to Corsi.
[03:12:00.146 --> 03:12:03.189]  Now Jerry Corsi will become their chief witness.
[03:12:03.189 --> 03:12:14.638]  According to ABC and NBC, Corsi now suddenly remembers that he did know that John Podesta's emails had been stolen, but he didn't know it from Wikileaks or Julia Science, he deduced it from his own research.
[03:12:14.638 --> 03:12:17.980]  Well, if that's true, he certainly never told me.
[03:12:17.980 --> 03:12:21.043]  Well, yeah, so what is the, now he was with Mueller for three days?
[03:12:21.503 --> 03:12:24.985]  According to the Washington Post, he was in preparation with the special counsel's office.
[03:12:24.985 --> 03:12:28.306]  So that must have been like 10 bottles of Ogden?
[03:12:28.306 --> 03:12:31.627]  I'm not going to speculate what he's telling them, but I do know this.
[03:12:31.627 --> 03:12:34.609]  I had no advance notice of the hacking.
[03:12:34.609 --> 03:12:36.429]  Look, we know all that.
[03:12:36.429 --> 03:12:38.030]  I get it.
[03:12:38.030 --> 03:12:41.272]  And Jerry Corsi never told me anything of the kind.
[03:12:41.272 --> 03:12:41.912]  You're no kidding.
[03:12:43.260 --> 03:12:47.585]  We find Russians trying to get us to sell the country out, we break their jaws and call the FBI on them.
[03:12:47.585 --> 03:12:49.668]  We certainly don't give them BJs.
[03:12:49.668 --> 03:12:52.491]  Hey, Paul Watson's taking over right now.
[03:12:52.491 --> 03:12:54.513]  What do you make of this breaking in live time?
[03:12:54.513 --> 03:12:57.157]  Roger said it either happened last night, it's happening.
[03:12:57.157 --> 03:12:57.897]  Sessions out.
[03:12:57.897 --> 03:12:59.840]  What does this signal to the PJW?
[03:13:02.159 --> 03:13:09.962]  Well, the most interesting thing over the last couple of hours, Alex, is not just this, but the reaction from the Trump-hating press corps during that press conference.
[03:13:09.962 --> 03:13:22.328]  If you wanted a clue as to how they feel about last night's results, just take a temperature reading of the sheer anger, the sheer vitriol that we saw during that press conference, and I'm going to get into these claims about
[03:13:22.828 --> 03:13:27.070]  Jim Acosta, because again Alex, they're painting him as the victim.
[03:13:27.070 --> 03:13:33.833]  They're painting Trump as a bullier of women for telling another woman to sit down after she went on a rant like Acosta.
[03:13:33.833 --> 03:13:41.697]  But if you watch the video, which is on Infowars.com, headlined Media sides with Acosta after physical confrontation with female White House staffer,
[03:13:42.751 --> 03:13:44.093]  People are saying this is assault.
[03:13:44.093 --> 03:13:45.455]  I don't think it's assault, Alex.
[03:13:45.455 --> 03:13:50.983]  I didn't think the Corey Lewandowski situation was assault, but many media outlets on the left said it was.
[03:13:50.983 --> 03:13:53.307]  This is basically the same thing.
[03:13:53.307 --> 03:13:54.829]  If you go down into that article,
[03:13:55.558 --> 03:14:00.201]  Scroll down, there's a video which has the exact moment, it's right there, if you press play on that.
[03:14:00.201 --> 03:14:00.581]  Yeah, play it.
[03:14:00.581 --> 03:14:07.165]  You watch Acosta's left arm, and this is after he's gone a rant, watch his left arm, he pushes her down.
[03:14:07.165 --> 03:14:13.229]  That is not much better than what Corey Lewandowski did to Michelle Fields in the same circumstance.
[03:14:13.229 --> 03:14:15.971]  Actually, that is brutal rape according to leftist ideology.
[03:14:16.900 --> 03:14:25.625]  Oh, if you flip it around, if that was a Conservative reporter grilling Obama, and she had come in as a White House aide for Obama, they would now be calling that assault.
[03:14:25.625 --> 03:14:26.225]  But they're not.
[03:14:26.225 --> 03:14:27.166]  They're doing the opposite.
[03:14:27.166 --> 03:14:28.727]  They're demonising this woman.
[03:14:28.727 --> 03:14:33.109]  You've got leftists all over Twitter saying, we're going to find her name, we're going to expose her.
[03:14:33.109 --> 03:14:36.251]  The NBC's come out with a piece defending Acosta.
[03:14:36.251 --> 03:14:38.432]  He's this brave, courageous journalist.
[03:14:39.355 --> 03:14:41.016]  Other people are saying this is assault.
[03:14:41.016 --> 03:14:41.836]  I don't think it's assault.
[03:14:41.836 --> 03:14:43.897]  I didn't think Corey Lewandowski was assault.
[03:14:43.897 --> 03:14:45.457]  But it's how the media is covering this.
[03:14:45.457 --> 03:14:47.358]  I want to be clear.
[03:14:47.358 --> 03:14:48.659]  I've appeared to be assault to me.
[03:14:48.659 --> 03:14:50.740]  I think he assaulted her from what I have to say.
[03:14:50.740 --> 03:14:54.041]  I admire Acosta as a woman who transitioned as a man.
[03:14:54.041 --> 03:14:56.782]  But other than that, now that he's done this, he's acting like a real jerk.
[03:14:59.133 --> 03:15:04.857]  Yeah, just watch the video, watch his left arm and roll-reverse it and see how the media would have reported on it.
[03:15:04.857 --> 03:15:09.841]  They're saying that Trump is a hateful woman-hater for telling April Ryan to sit down.
[03:15:09.841 --> 03:15:12.523]  This is what Acosta does to women when they try and do their job.
[03:15:12.523 --> 03:15:15.645]  Yeah, you would tell them to sit down, that's right, but if you... ...around the microphone.
[03:15:15.645 --> 03:15:19.048]  If you're violent, obviously he's not a woman that transitions to a man, it's called a joke.
[03:15:19.948 --> 03:15:21.130]  Paul, you're taking over.
[03:15:21.130 --> 03:15:27.317]  I'm going to shoot some special reports with Roger, and then the war room's coming up with Owen Schroyer in about 45 minutes.

[03:15:53.777 --> 03:15:54.978]  Hear that?
[03:15:54.978 --> 03:16:00.360]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[03:16:00.360 --> 03:16:03.261]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.

[03:16:23.382 --> 03:16:29.724]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[03:16:29.724 --> 03:16:32.765]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[03:16:32.765 --> 03:16:38.687]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[03:16:38.687 --> 03:16:42.488]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[03:16:42.488 --> 03:16:43.748]  Was there ever a vote?
[03:16:43.748 --> 03:16:45.089]  Who do we fight for?
[03:16:45.089 --> 03:16:51.290]  The deep state began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[03:16:51.290 --> 03:16:52.731]  Available at Amazon Books.
[03:16:53.404 --> 03:16:56.987]  The pain in my neck, back and shoulders has really gotten worse.
[03:16:56.987 --> 03:17:00.550]  Relief for body pain is here with Sunny Bay Heating Pads.
[03:17:00.550 --> 03:17:02.692]  Well, the last thing I want is to take another pill.

[03:17:54.298 --> 03:17:58.259]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[03:17:58.259 --> 03:18:01.540]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[03:18:01.540 --> 03:18:07.802]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[03:18:07.802 --> 03:18:10.583]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[03:18:11.323 --> 03:18:15.147]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[03:18:15.147 --> 03:18:21.612]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[03:18:21.612 --> 03:18:26.577]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[03:18:27.321 --> 03:18:31.242]  Next, we tested the water from our AlexaPure gravity filter.
[03:18:31.242 --> 03:18:38.444]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[03:18:38.444 --> 03:18:43.145]  As it turns out, the filter on the AlexaPure raises the pH of the water.
[03:18:43.145 --> 03:18:49.347]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[03:18:49.347 --> 03:18:53.328]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[03:18:54.318 --> 03:19:02.702]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym, or to go for a run, or go to the park, or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[03:19:02.702 --> 03:19:04.183]  Believe me, I know.
[03:19:04.183 --> 03:19:08.885]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[03:19:08.885 --> 03:19:13.888]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com, I still have that energy.
[03:19:14.108 --> 03:19:34.268]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[03:19:34.768 --> 03:19:38.771]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.

[03:19:50.157 --> 03:19:57.782]  Supermail Vitality from Infowarsstore.com.
[03:19:57.782 --> 03:20:00.404]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:13.891 --> 03:20:20.914]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:20.914 --> 03:20:24.716]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:20:27.611 --> 03:20:35.614]  There's more evidence that Jim Acosta, CNN's activist-in-chief, assaulted a woman than Brett Kavanaugh.
[03:20:35.614 --> 03:20:40.555]  That's what Jack Posobiec had to say about this, and the article is up on In4Wars.com.
[03:20:40.555 --> 03:20:51.018]  This has been swamped by the news, obviously, of Jeff Sessions being fired, and of leftists on Twitter freaking out over the Robert Mueller investigation being terminated.
[03:20:51.018 --> 03:20:54.760]  Well, I'm not going to let this one slide, because it was a national conversation.
[03:20:54.760 --> 03:20:56.140]  It was a huge news story.
[03:20:57.088 --> 03:21:09.795]  When former Trump staffer Corey Lewandowski, back during the 2016 campaign, supposedly, according to a lot of people, assaulted Michelle Fields when he tried to keep her away from Trump.
[03:21:09.795 --> 03:21:11.656]  You've obviously seen the footage before.
[03:21:11.656 --> 03:21:13.257]  I don't think that was the assault.
[03:21:13.257 --> 03:21:16.219]  Lewandowski obviously claimed that he didn't know who she was at the time.
[03:21:16.219 --> 03:21:18.500]  He thought she might be a security threat.
[03:21:18.500 --> 03:21:20.061]  She was trying to ask Trump a question.
[03:21:20.061 --> 03:21:22.462]  She was trying to get in his personal space.
[03:21:22.462 --> 03:21:25.884]  And Lewandowski basically brushed her aside, brushed her out of the way.
[03:21:26.522 --> 03:21:42.946]  Now how much worse was that than this, which happened just a couple of hours ago during Trump's press conference, where Acosta goes on this rant, he asks numerous questions, obviously making it all about himself once again, angling for his own cable show.
[03:21:44.016 --> 03:21:46.177]  Watch his left arm during this confrontation.
[03:21:46.177 --> 03:21:48.878]  This is a physical confrontation with a female.
[03:21:48.878 --> 03:21:49.858]  You can call it that.
[03:21:49.858 --> 03:21:51.439]  That would be very accurate.
[03:21:51.439 --> 03:21:55.061]  Again, I don't think it's assault, but a lot of people are claiming that it is.
[03:21:55.061 --> 03:22:08.426]  And the media reporting, if this had been flipped around, if this had been a conservative reporter confronting Obama, getting in Obama's face during a press conference, going on a rant, because they're an activist like Jim Acosta is,
[03:22:08.988 --> 03:22:10.209]  And this had to happen.
[03:22:10.209 --> 03:22:16.013]  Now bear in mind, this woman, it's her job to take the microphone and hand it to other reporters.
[03:22:16.013 --> 03:22:18.795]  Trump asks Acosta to sit down numerous times.
[03:22:18.795 --> 03:22:21.297]  She goes to take the microphone, look at his left hand.
[03:22:21.297 --> 03:22:26.641]  When she goes to grab it, he pushes down right there with his left hand.
[03:22:26.641 --> 03:22:29.703]  I don't think this is assault, many people saying that it is.
[03:22:29.703 --> 03:22:35.287]  Let's look at what some of other, and the way, the big story here is the way the media is reporting it.
[03:22:35.287 --> 03:22:37.869]  Because if you go back to the article on Infowars.com,
[03:22:38.570 --> 03:22:42.873]  Media sides with Acosta after physical confrontation with female White House staffer.
[03:22:42.873 --> 03:22:45.656]  How did NBC News report this?
[03:22:45.656 --> 03:23:00.207]  They said, quote, if you scroll down there's an NBC News tweet in there, they said, White House aide grabs and tries to physically remove a microphone from CNN correspondent Jim Acosta during a contentious exchange with President Trump at a news conference.
[03:23:00.979 --> 03:23:03.461]  So they're blaming the woman.
[03:23:03.461 --> 03:23:07.645]  Oh, I thought we were supposed to believe all women in these Me Too times.
[03:23:07.645 --> 03:23:11.248]  They're saying that she tried to grab the mic and physically remove it.
[03:23:11.248 --> 03:23:15.391]  While that's true, you can say the exact same thing about Jim Acosta.
[03:23:15.391 --> 03:23:23.458]  He pushes down, he physically wrestles with her, at least with his arms, to keep hold of the microphone.
[03:23:23.458 --> 03:23:26.541]  This would normally be a massive story if the roles were reversed.
[03:23:27.242 --> 03:23:36.327]  John Poderetz, who I think is a never-Trumper, so he's no fan of Trump, responded to that NBC report by saying, quote, This doesn't describe what happened properly at all.
[03:23:36.327 --> 03:23:41.369]  It was her job to move the mic to the next person and he wouldn't surrender it.
[03:23:41.369 --> 03:23:49.794]  ABC News reported, Trump scolds CNN reporter for being rude as White House staffer wrestles microphone away during presser.
[03:23:50.484 --> 03:23:52.705]  That's wrong in two instances.
[03:23:52.705 --> 03:23:53.865]  She didn't wrestle with him.
[03:23:53.865 --> 03:23:54.826]  He wrestled with her.
[03:23:54.826 --> 03:23:58.788]  He was putting more physical force on her than she was on him.
[03:23:58.788 --> 03:24:00.128]  And she didn't wrestle it away.
[03:24:00.128 --> 03:24:00.908]  She didn't get it.
[03:24:00.908 --> 03:24:04.410]  She gave up after he pushed down on her arm.
[03:24:04.410 --> 03:24:09.132]  He appears to say something to her after this incident, immediately after, as you can see.
[03:24:09.132 --> 03:24:11.253]  And she backs away immediately.
[03:24:11.253 --> 03:24:13.514]  The Daily Caller's Derek Hunter asks this.
[03:24:14.269 --> 03:24:18.952]  Will CNN PR address Acosta assaulting a young woman working for the White House?
[03:24:18.952 --> 03:24:22.654]  Or will they just congratulate him for his courage?
[03:24:22.654 --> 03:24:26.136]  So again, I'm not saying this is assault, but a lot of people are.
[03:24:26.136 --> 03:24:29.378]  And it's a breaking news story, or at least it was as of a couple of hours ago.
[03:24:29.378 --> 03:24:36.802]  Now it's been completely swamped by the Jeff Sessions news and the Mueller investigation possibly being shut down.
[03:24:37.600 --> 03:24:45.325]  John Ekdal asks, I think we need to have a national conversation about Jim Acosta's aggressive behaviour towards women.
[03:24:45.325 --> 03:24:46.345]  What do you think about it?
[03:24:46.345 --> 03:24:50.628]  Go and watch the clip for yourself.
[03:24:50.628 --> 03:24:52.909]  There's a Daily Caller story about the same issue.
[03:24:52.909 --> 03:24:56.211]  Ronna McDaniel tweets, I was sat in the front row of today's press conference
[03:24:56.775 --> 03:25:03.598]  We all value a free press, but it's unfortunate that some reporters seem more interested in getting their own cable show than doing their jobs.
[03:25:03.598 --> 03:25:08.261]  Again, talking about the activist-in-chief over at CNN, Jim Acosta.
[03:25:08.261 --> 03:25:11.542]  He says the media grandstanding has gone overboard.
[03:25:11.542 --> 03:25:20.807]  Now look how a feminist, with literally a blue wave in her profile, and a blue wave emoji in her Twitter profile, responded to this incident.
[03:25:22.139 --> 03:25:23.959]  And this was in response to the CNN tweet.
[03:25:23.959 --> 03:25:27.760]  She said, quote, She crossed a major line on national TV.
[03:25:27.760 --> 03:25:29.621]  Again, blaming the woman.
[03:25:29.621 --> 03:25:35.022]  It won't even be an hour and her name will be known worldwide and it won't go well for her.
[03:25:35.022 --> 03:25:40.964]  Now that tweet was deleted in a hurry as soon as I highlighted it, but somebody saved a screenshot which I posted again right there.
[03:25:40.964 --> 03:25:42.424]  You can see it.
[03:25:42.424 --> 03:25:43.965]  So this is a Democrat.
[03:25:43.965 --> 03:25:45.685]  This is a proud resistance member.
[03:25:45.685 --> 03:25:47.125]  No doubt a proud feminist.
[03:25:47.125 --> 03:25:49.666]  Maybe someone who even marched in the Women's March.
[03:25:50.402 --> 03:26:04.187]  Somebody who hates Trump and thinks he's an evil misogynist, literally calling for this woman, who is just trying to do her job, to be exposed, to be condemned, to be vilified, when if anything, he's the one assaulting her.
[03:26:04.187 --> 03:26:08.008]  I don't think anyone got assaulted, but a lot of people do.
[03:26:08.008 --> 03:26:14.970]  Is this going to be an actual news story, or is Jim Acosta going to continue to be painted as the victim?
[03:26:14.970 --> 03:26:19.692]  There you see one individual who was at a press conference reacting to it, another who was there,
[03:26:20.962 --> 03:26:22.064]  Or at least witness this.
[03:26:22.064 --> 03:26:28.753]  Amber Athe said Acosta just accused Trump of attacking April Ryan, another journalist, by telling her to sit down.
[03:26:28.753 --> 03:26:34.200]  To be clear, April Ryan was shouting out of turn while my colleague was attempting to ask the President a question.
[03:26:34.844 --> 03:26:38.406]  So again, there's this narrative that all these journalists support each other.
[03:26:38.406 --> 03:26:47.833]  As soon as Trump got into this spat with Acosta, and we've got the video of that, we might go to that later, the next reporter he went to said, oh no, actually, Jim's a great guy.
[03:26:47.833 --> 03:26:50.674]  So there's this narrative that they all stand up for each other.
[03:26:50.674 --> 03:26:51.575]  Not in this case.
[03:26:51.575 --> 03:26:58.620]  This other journalist was very annoyed about the fact that Jim Acosta was hogging her time, or his time.
[03:26:58.620 --> 03:26:59.820]  Let me just check who this was.
[03:26:59.820 --> 03:27:01.922]  Yeah, it was a man.
[03:27:01.922 --> 03:27:03.463]  So they don't all support each other.
[03:27:04.534 --> 03:27:08.498]  And many people are asking the question, was this assault by Jim Costa?
[03:27:08.498 --> 03:27:11.261]  Now CNN has not responded to that whatsoever.
[03:27:11.261 --> 03:27:12.522]  They did put out a statement...
[03:27:13.357 --> 03:27:20.959]  About this, Jim Acosta being rude, being a terrible person according to Trump, because again he went on an unhinged rant.
[03:27:20.959 --> 03:27:37.004]  Why are you demonizing the migrants without any mention of the fact that they're literally on video throwing rocks at helicopters, literally reports of them violently attacking Mexican police, throwing Molotov cocktails, actually trying to obtain weapons, obtain guns in one instance.
[03:27:37.004 --> 03:27:38.685]  But CNN responded with this.
[03:27:40.009 --> 03:27:43.758]  This President's ongoing attacks on the press have gone too far!
[03:27:43.758 --> 03:27:45.924]  Bear in mind this is supposed to be a news organisation.
[03:27:46.573 --> 03:27:49.576]  They're not only dangerous, they are disturbingly un-American.
[03:27:49.576 --> 03:27:53.639]  While President Trump has made it clear he does not respect a free press, he has sworn obligation to protect it.
[03:27:53.639 --> 03:27:55.521]  A free press is vital to democracy.
[03:27:55.521 --> 03:27:58.724]  We stand behind Jim Acosta and his fellow journalists everywhere.
[03:27:58.724 --> 03:28:05.330]  Okay, that could have come out of any far-left, moveon.org, George Soros resistance organisation.
[03:28:05.330 --> 03:28:11.936]  Because that is the statement of an activist group, not of an impartial, independent media organisation.
[03:28:12.516 --> 03:28:13.157]  I'm biased.
[03:28:13.157 --> 03:28:14.197]  Infowars is biased.
[03:28:14.197 --> 03:28:15.098]  We don't try and hide it.
[03:28:15.098 --> 03:28:18.200]  We don't pretend to be this middle-of-the-road, impartial outfit.
[03:28:18.200 --> 03:28:19.401]  We've got a bias.
[03:28:19.401 --> 03:28:20.721]  And so does CNN.
[03:28:20.721 --> 03:28:22.703]  They're an activist organization.
[03:28:22.703 --> 03:28:27.586]  I tweeted in response, should CNN have their press confidentials revoked?
[03:28:27.586 --> 03:28:31.068]  That tweet was the top response to this CNN statement.
[03:28:32.482 --> 03:28:39.527]  On my account and also when I was not signed into my account as the top response was removed from Twitter within about an hour.
[03:28:39.527 --> 03:28:41.909]  So they didn't want that going viral.
[03:28:41.909 --> 03:28:44.070]  We'll get more into this story and others after the break.
[03:28:44.070 --> 03:28:45.951]  This is the Alex Jones Show live.

[03:28:54.731 --> 03:28:58.654]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:28:58.654 --> 03:29:00.195]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:29:00.195 --> 03:29:03.157]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:29:03.157 --> 03:29:08.720]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:29:08.720 --> 03:29:09.921]  I can help you, too.

[03:29:54.471 --> 03:30:00.496]  Our grandparents and great-grandparents knew they canned food during the fall so they'd have it during the winter.
[03:30:00.496 --> 03:30:03.439]  And that's what I'm talking about at MFootwearStore.com.
[03:30:03.439 --> 03:30:07.482]  With MFootwear Select, it's the full spectrum of my Patriot Supply.
[03:30:09.048 --> 03:30:18.191]  Most respected companies out there, but because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able to do.

[03:30:54.005 --> 03:31:04.615]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[03:31:04.615 --> 03:31:06.677]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[03:31:06.677 --> 03:31:09.539]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[03:31:09.539 --> 03:31:11.041]  It's made in the USA.
[03:31:11.041 --> 03:31:17.867]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[03:31:17.867 --> 03:31:19.088]  It is a classical 360 wind.
[03:31:19.929 --> 03:31:29.631]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[03:31:29.631 --> 03:31:46.434]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be, because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brushfires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[03:31:46.434 --> 03:31:49.595]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[03:31:49.755 --> 03:31:53.038]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Field at Infowarslife.com.
[03:32:05.849 --> 03:32:12.591]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[03:32:12.591 --> 03:32:18.833]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good, but hard to source, and the Globeless tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[03:32:18.833 --> 03:32:25.115]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[03:32:25.115 --> 03:32:32.058]  Now, due to the Establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[03:32:33.218 --> 03:32:34.819]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:33:09.179 --> 03:33:11.443]  Broadcasting live from the U.N.
[03:33:11.443 --> 03:33:17.773]  stronghold, Austin, Texas, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:17.773 --> 03:33:21.499]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:33:23.928 --> 03:33:25.690]  We're back on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:25.690 --> 03:33:40.426]  We're going to get into some more news aside from the fallout from the midterms later on in the hour, including the pensioner, the 69-year-old pensioner who now wants to identify as a 45-year-old man so he can attract more women on Tinder.
[03:33:40.426 --> 03:33:43.870]  And he says, hey, somebody can try and change their gender.
[03:33:44.847 --> 03:33:54.072]  For their own benefit, for, you know, greater acceptance in the workplace, greater limiting, getting rid of the limitations in terms of employment.
[03:33:54.072 --> 03:33:59.875]  And why can't he do the same and legally change his age to become a 45-year-old man?
[03:33:59.875 --> 03:34:00.796]  It's a good argument.
[03:34:00.796 --> 03:34:01.556]  We'll get into it.
[03:34:01.556 --> 03:34:04.178]  It's out of the Daily Mail later on in the show.
[03:34:04.178 --> 03:34:08.460]  But first, obviously, aside from the breaking news about Jeff Sessions, which
[03:34:09.281 --> 03:34:17.045]  Unfortunately for Jim O'Costa, he probably hates the fact that it's taken attention away from him because he wants to be the center of attention at all times.
[03:34:17.045 --> 03:34:18.826]  We're going to round up on that right now.
[03:34:18.826 --> 03:34:23.849]  We've got the clip of Jim O'Costa's confrontation with Trump, about a two minute clip.
[03:34:23.849 --> 03:34:24.990]  We're going to roll it right now.
[03:34:26.047 --> 03:34:33.830]  I want to challenge you on one of the statements that you made in the tail end of the campaign in the midterms.
[03:34:33.830 --> 03:34:35.330]  Here we go.
[03:34:35.330 --> 03:34:39.171]  If you don't mind, Mr. President, that this caravan was an invasion.
[03:34:39.171 --> 03:34:40.972]  I consider it to be an invasion.
[03:34:40.972 --> 03:34:43.173]  As you know, Mr. President, the caravan was not an invasion.
[03:34:43.173 --> 03:34:49.035]  It's a group of migrants moving up from Central America towards the border with the U.S.
[03:34:49.035 --> 03:34:50.135]  Thank you for telling me that.
[03:34:50.635 --> 03:34:54.196]  Why did you characterize it as such?
[03:34:54.196 --> 03:34:56.537]  Because I consider it an invasion.
[03:34:56.537 --> 03:34:57.858]  You and I have a difference of opinion.
[03:34:57.858 --> 03:35:01.279]  But do you think that you demonized immigrants in this election?
[03:35:01.279 --> 03:35:02.640]  No, not at all.
[03:35:02.640 --> 03:35:05.341]  I want them to come into the country, but they have to come in legally.
[03:35:05.341 --> 03:35:07.742]  You know, they have to come in, Jim, through a process.
[03:35:07.742 --> 03:35:09.342]  I want it to be a process.
[03:35:09.342 --> 03:35:11.443]  And I want people to come in, and we need the people.
[03:35:13.524 --> 03:35:15.426]  You know why we need the people, Dajan?
[03:35:15.426 --> 03:35:17.649]  Because we have hundreds of companies moving in.
[03:35:17.649 --> 03:35:18.750]  We need the people.
[03:35:18.750 --> 03:35:23.094]  But your campaign had an ad showing migrants climbing over walls and so on.
[03:35:23.094 --> 03:35:23.995]  Well, that's true.
[03:35:23.995 --> 03:35:24.736]  But they weren't actors.
[03:35:24.736 --> 03:35:25.697]  They're not going to be doing that.
[03:35:25.697 --> 03:35:26.778]  They weren't actors.
[03:35:26.778 --> 03:35:27.599]  No, it's true.
[03:35:27.599 --> 03:35:28.921]  Do you think they were actors?
[03:35:28.921 --> 03:35:29.641]  They weren't actors.
[03:35:29.641 --> 03:35:31.443]  They didn't come from Hollywood.
[03:35:31.443 --> 03:35:32.905]  These were people, this was an actual...
[03:35:35.047 --> 03:35:37.748]  You know, it happened a few days ago.
[03:35:37.748 --> 03:35:39.428]  They're hundreds of miles away though.
[03:35:39.428 --> 03:35:41.269]  They're hundreds and hundreds of miles away.
[03:35:41.269 --> 03:35:42.489]  That's not an invasion.
[03:35:42.489 --> 03:35:45.150]  Honestly, I think you should let me run the country.
[03:35:45.150 --> 03:35:46.571]  You run CNN.
[03:35:46.571 --> 03:35:48.911]  And if you did it well, your ratings will be much better.
[03:35:48.911 --> 03:35:49.532]  That's enough.
[03:35:49.532 --> 03:35:50.072]  That's enough.
[03:35:57.034 --> 03:35:58.794]  Pardon me, ma'am.
[03:35:58.794 --> 03:35:59.395]  That's enough.
[03:35:59.395 --> 03:36:10.537]  Mr. President, if I may ask on the Russia investigation, are you concerned that you may have... I'm not concerned about anything with the Russia investigation because it's a hoax.
[03:36:10.537 --> 03:36:11.097]  That's enough.
[03:36:11.097 --> 03:36:11.998]  Put down the mic.
[03:36:11.998 --> 03:36:17.719]  Mr. President, are you worried about indictments coming down in this investigation?
[03:36:17.719 --> 03:36:18.239]  Mr. President.
[03:36:19.193 --> 03:36:23.575]  I'll tell you what, CNN should be ashamed of itself having you working for them.
[03:36:23.575 --> 03:36:25.935]  You are a rude, terrible person.
[03:36:25.935 --> 03:36:28.196]  You shouldn't be working for CNN.
[03:36:28.196 --> 03:36:30.217]  Go ahead.
[03:36:30.217 --> 03:36:30.857]  I think that's unfair.
[03:36:30.857 --> 03:36:31.898]  You're a very rude person.
[03:36:31.898 --> 03:36:34.699]  The way you treat Sarah Huckabee is horrible.
[03:36:34.699 --> 03:36:36.959]  And the way you treat other people are horrible.
[03:36:36.959 --> 03:36:38.320]  You shouldn't treat people that way.
[03:36:38.320 --> 03:36:38.560]  Go ahead.
[03:36:39.641 --> 03:36:42.203]  In Jim's defense, I've traveled with him and watched him.
[03:36:42.203 --> 03:36:44.084]  He's a diligent reporter who busts his butt like the rest of us.
[03:36:44.084 --> 03:36:45.205]  Well, I'm not a big fan of yours either, so.
[03:36:45.205 --> 03:36:45.605]  I understand.
[03:36:45.605 --> 03:36:46.646]  To be honest.
[03:36:46.646 --> 03:36:48.307]  So let me ask you a question if I can.
[03:36:48.307 --> 03:36:50.309]  You repeatedly said- You are the best.
[03:36:50.309 --> 03:36:53.972]  Mr. President, you repeatedly, over the course of- Just sit down, please.
[03:36:55.856 --> 03:37:03.403]  But when you, when you report fake news, no, when you report fake news, which CNN does a lot, you are the enemy of the people.
[03:37:03.403 --> 03:37:03.763]  Go ahead.
[03:37:03.763 --> 03:37:08.988]  Mr. President, over the course, over the course of the last several days of the campaign, sir.
[03:37:08.988 --> 03:37:14.894]  So again, you see from that clip, even after Acosta sat down, even after he's handed the mic over,
[03:37:15.254 --> 03:37:17.196]  To his sympathetic colleague.
[03:37:17.196 --> 03:37:21.839]  He stands up yet again and tries to basically filibuster the press conference.
[03:37:21.839 --> 03:37:30.406]  So he had his two questions, he had his little spat, his confrontation, which he always seeks out because he wants to be the centre of attention, because he's angling for his own cable news show.
[03:37:31.078 --> 03:37:42.001]  He got into the confrontation, he got his little spat, which he wanted to get on camera, sat down, then stood up again, even after his colleague who defended him started talking and trying to ask his question.
[03:37:42.001 --> 03:37:46.962]  Acosta then tried to insert himself into the situation yet again.
[03:37:46.962 --> 03:37:59.385]  And that's all aside from what we talked about in the last segment, which is him, according to some people, physically assaulting a woman as he pulled down his left arm to prevent her from retrieving the microphone, which was her job.
[03:38:00.487 --> 03:38:07.110]  A basically identical situation to what happened with Corey Lewandowski which much of the left-wing media described as assault.
[03:38:07.110 --> 03:38:10.691]  They're not even acknowledging that this incident took place.
[03:38:10.691 --> 03:38:15.453]  This is what Lindsey Graham said in response to this confrontation on Twitter.
[03:38:19.230 --> 03:38:24.212]  The way they are conducting themselves today will do nothing to improve their standing with the American people.
[03:38:24.212 --> 03:38:32.335]  Remember we had the polls last week, I think it was, where they asked Americans, who's causing more division, more rancor in the country?
[03:38:32.335 --> 03:38:34.375]  Is it President Trump or is it the media?
[03:38:34.375 --> 03:38:38.037]  The majority of respondents in that poll said it was the media.
[03:38:38.037 --> 03:38:45.239]  So this whole narrative that they try and drum up every time that it's solely the fault of Trump is not believed by the American people.
[03:38:45.239 --> 03:38:47.560]  Which is why Lindsey Graham says that they live in a bubble.
[03:38:47.560 --> 03:38:47.860]  They do.
[03:38:48.897 --> 03:38:57.761]  He continues, certain members of the press cannot stand the fact that President Trump and Republicans defied expectations in the midterm elections, actually growing SNA majority.
[03:38:57.761 --> 03:39:00.182]  And that is the tone that came out of that press conference.
[03:39:00.182 --> 03:39:02.043]  They were angry.
[03:39:02.043 --> 03:39:03.283]  They were butthurt.
[03:39:03.283 --> 03:39:10.587]  To say they won the House, and that's supposedly a victory, didn't come across that they were very pleased with what happened last night.
[03:39:10.587 --> 03:39:18.230]  They weren't too satisfied with the results if their anger, if their aggression, if their tone during that press conference was anything to go by.
[03:39:19.241 --> 03:39:21.506]  Graham concludes, he did a series of tweets on this.
[03:39:31.391 --> 03:39:33.313]  And that is the key word there, activists.
[03:39:33.313 --> 03:39:43.085]  CNN came out with a tweet response, an official statement from CNN PR, which sounded exactly like the statement that would be made by a far-left activist organization.
[03:39:43.085 --> 03:39:48.271]  They're not an impartial media outlet, should their credentials be pulled.
[03:39:48.271 --> 03:39:49.152]  That is the question.
[03:39:50.160 --> 03:40:02.328]  And in regard to Jim Acosta, who at this point is clearly just trying to filibuster press conferences to make himself even more famous because his ego is so massive, monumental, oversized and out of control.
[03:40:02.328 --> 03:40:08.291]  Well now even left-wing publications are starting to somewhat throw Jim Acosta under a bus.
[03:40:08.291 --> 03:40:10.793]  This is out of Daily Wire, a left-wing publication.
[03:40:10.793 --> 03:40:14.155]  CNN's Jim Acosta is dangerous to journalism.
[03:40:14.155 --> 03:40:17.437]  This is a left-wing publication that said this out of the Atlantic.
[03:40:18.166 --> 03:40:29.171]  A left-leaning news publication published an article this week profiling CNN's Jim Acosta, suggesting the White House correspondent has lost the fight and become a performance journalist rather than a real reporter.
[03:40:29.171 --> 03:40:36.434]  Now, the article published by The Atlantic was called, Jim Acosta's Dangerous Friend of Performance Journalism.
[03:40:36.434 --> 03:40:43.637]  And they accused him of being a professional provocateur who amplifies the President's anti-press campaign.
[03:40:44.542 --> 03:40:45.223]  They said, quote,
[03:41:01.511 --> 03:41:17.864]  So they're actually calling for Jim Acosta, like Trump did today, to shut up and sit down because he's making Democrats, he's making the left look bad because he's feeding into this narrative that the press are at least as equally divisive as Trump.
[03:41:17.864 --> 03:41:23.868]  So, given what we saw during that press conference, you know, his colleague immediately rushed to his support.
[03:41:23.868 --> 03:41:30.033]  Not everybody is rushing to the aid of Jim Acosta if that article in The Atlantic is anything to go by.
[03:41:30.521 --> 03:41:31.662]  The writer concludes, So again,
[03:41:47.290 --> 03:41:48.051]  He's an activist.
[03:41:48.051 --> 03:41:51.374]  He's working for CNN, which is an activist organization at this point.
[03:41:51.374 --> 03:41:58.842]  You saw him bob up and down time and time again, already getting his confrontation, already trying to make himself the story of the day.
[03:41:58.842 --> 03:42:09.814]  Then he came back again for a second bite, even after they finally wrestled the microphone away from him, at the risk of him assaulting women, which is what a lot of people are claiming he did right now.
[03:42:10.385 --> 03:42:21.547]  So again, if that was a success last night for the Democrats, the media, which is a front for the Democratic Party, as Lindsey Graham said, most of it anyway, don't seem very pleased with the outcome.
[03:42:22.173 --> 03:42:29.014]  As somebody else said on Twitter, the only wave in 2018 was the left waving goodbye to the Supreme Court.
[03:42:29.014 --> 03:42:35.176]  The blue wave turned out to be nothing more than a puddle, and I think deep down they realize that.
[03:42:35.176 --> 03:42:39.817]  Deep down, overall, it was actually a good outcome for Trump.
[03:42:39.817 --> 03:42:42.497]  We'll be back on the Alex Jones Show live in the next segment.
[03:42:42.497 --> 03:42:44.138]  Breaking news at InfoWars.com.

[03:43:57.638 --> 03:44:01.120]  And you saw 18 Twitter accounts, they say, affiliated with InfoWars.
[03:44:01.120 --> 03:44:02.881]  Yeah, some of them are like little side accounts.
[03:44:02.881 --> 03:44:06.162]  They know we had like InfoWars store that just showed our products.
[03:44:06.162 --> 03:44:12.925]  But they just banned them all yesterday in punishment that I be at a Trump rally and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us.
[03:44:12.925 --> 03:44:18.028]  Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from the brink.
[03:44:18.348 --> 03:44:24.472]  But the globalists now want to target where the resistance came from, so that we're not pesky in the future.
[03:44:24.472 --> 03:44:27.453]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[03:44:27.453 --> 03:44:28.534]  I want to keep going.
[03:44:28.534 --> 03:44:32.356]  I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially.
[03:44:32.356 --> 03:44:34.397]  I want to push all the way.
[03:44:34.397 --> 03:44:35.678]  I've committed to do that.
[03:44:35.678 --> 03:44:36.759]  I've prayed for that.
[03:44:36.759 --> 03:44:38.419]  And I've been told that's going to happen.
[03:44:38.419 --> 03:44:40.841]  But you've got to back us, and I promise you this.
[03:44:41.341 --> 03:44:42.644]  I will never falter.
[03:44:42.644 --> 03:44:44.989]  I will never waver at the spiritual level.
[03:44:44.989 --> 03:44:45.930]  I physically will.
[03:44:45.930 --> 03:44:52.684]  But I give you my commitment, if you financially support us, and 4Wars4.com to give you my absolute total commitment.

[03:45:02.557 --> 03:45:04.038]  Believe me, I know.
[03:45:04.038 --> 03:45:08.740]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[03:45:08.740 --> 03:45:13.742]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com, I still have that energy.
[03:45:13.962 --> 03:45:34.120]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.

[03:46:29.303 --> 03:46:30.264]  Never gone this low.

[03:47:10.263 --> 03:47:12.547]  News, analysis, reports.
[03:47:12.547 --> 03:47:15.051]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:15.051 --> 03:47:19.036]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:47:21.297 --> 03:47:33.103]  There's more reaction coming in to that Jim Acosta incident where some people are accusing him of assaulting the White House staffer who tried to retrieve a microphone from him during his elongated confrontation with President Trump.
[03:47:33.103 --> 03:47:37.765]  Mike Cernovich says someone should make a comparison GIF of Corey Lewandowski and Acosta.
[03:47:37.765 --> 03:47:40.346]  It really is an apples to apples comparison.
[03:47:41.460 --> 03:47:47.205]  Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch says the Acosta karate chop, way to go CNN.
[03:47:47.205 --> 03:47:50.168]  So this is going to continue to snowball.
[03:47:50.168 --> 03:47:53.671]  Basically CNN's completely ignored it, the left's completely ignored it.
[03:47:53.671 --> 03:48:00.557]  Again proving that when it comes to feminism they abandon all their feminist ideals when there's a narrative to be pushed.
[03:48:00.557 --> 03:48:03.199]  But again I think this is going to roll for a little bit longer.
[03:48:03.199 --> 03:48:08.144]  Before we get into some of the other news though I want to tell you about the great specials available at Infowarsstore.com.

[03:48:58.456 --> 03:49:03.260]  So we have the Mega Blowout Special available for you right now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:49:03.260 --> 03:49:05.663]  The campaign for 2020 has basically already started.
[03:49:05.663 --> 03:49:07.124]  We need funding to get us through it.
[03:49:07.124 --> 03:49:12.229]  We need to continue to thrive with your support which has been outstanding in the interim.
[03:49:12.229 --> 03:49:16.993]  So please continue to support us by getting the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:49:18.644 --> 03:49:22.625]  I mean, finishing off on the midterm news, we've basically covered it at length.
[03:49:22.625 --> 03:49:25.866]  The celebrity endorsements completely failed, didn't they?
[03:49:25.866 --> 03:49:31.348]  Taylor Swift endorsing Bill Bredesen out of Tennessee, he lost handily.
[03:49:31.348 --> 03:49:38.410]  Oprah Winfrey, who, you know, as of earlier this year was basically being tipped to run for president herself, although she denied it.
[03:49:38.410 --> 03:49:42.451]  America's biggest celebrity, according to many people, campaigned for
[03:49:43.231 --> 03:49:47.015]  Georgia Democrat gubernatorial candidate Stacey Adams, she lost.
[03:49:47.015 --> 03:49:51.318]  So these celebrity endorsements, I would think they're starting to backfire at this point.
[03:49:51.318 --> 03:49:55.262]  The polls have shown that people are just sick of celebrities talking about politics.
[03:49:55.262 --> 03:49:58.245]  I love it because they get to make videos and make fun out of them.
[03:49:58.245 --> 03:50:04.951]  But Americans, when it comes to actually being convinced by celebrities like Taylor Swift and Oprah Winfrey, are basically turning off.
[03:50:04.951 --> 03:50:07.193]  They don't want to hear about it.
[03:50:07.193 --> 03:50:09.535]  So is it going to be a winning strategy for Democrats?
[03:50:10.484 --> 03:50:22.010]  To have the Beyonce's, to have all these rap stars, all these big celebrities endorsing whoever the Democratic candidate is in 2020, given that it's looking like it's starting to backfire.
[03:50:22.010 --> 03:50:33.597]  Piers Morgan's come out with an article over at the Daily Mail, if this blue puddle is the best the Democrats can achieve after two years of celebrity-fueled screaming, then they need a better plan for 2020 or Trump will drown them.
[03:50:34.614 --> 03:50:45.881]  He says the Democrats sneaked back at the House of Representatives with a swing of seats far smaller than the shellacking that engulfed incumbent first-time Presidents Clinton and Obama in 1994 and 2010.
[03:50:45.881 --> 03:50:53.586]  And of course, both Obama and Clinton, despite losing the House, went on to get re-elected anyway.
[03:50:54.844 --> 03:50:56.886]  There's also an article out of Breitbart.
[03:50:56.886 --> 03:51:01.550]  Best news of 2018 midterm is Kavanaugh backlash against Senate Democrats.
[03:51:01.550 --> 03:51:06.695]  He points out Claire McGaskill, Joe Donnelly, Heidi Heitkamp.
[03:51:06.695 --> 03:51:07.916]  All lost.
[03:51:07.916 --> 03:51:10.338]  Again, Phil Bredesen lost as well.
[03:51:10.338 --> 03:51:16.464]  All the Democrats who went against Kavanaugh in that bitter, bitter fight, including Bill Nelson on top of that.
[03:51:16.464 --> 03:51:17.045]  All lost.
[03:51:17.045 --> 03:51:18.586]  It looks like Nelson's about to lose.
[03:51:18.586 --> 03:51:20.668]  They're still tabulating the votes there.
[03:51:21.764 --> 03:51:23.325]  John Tester as well.
[03:51:23.325 --> 03:51:25.005]  I think he actually came through and won in the end.
[03:51:25.005 --> 03:51:29.187]  But most of the Democrats who went against Kavanaugh lost.
[03:51:29.187 --> 03:51:30.367]  They got punished for that.
[03:51:30.367 --> 03:51:32.668]  So again, that was another losing issue for Democrats.
[03:51:32.668 --> 03:51:37.830]  Which again, why they don't seem to be too happy today despite taking the House.
[03:51:37.830 --> 03:51:42.111]  Trump's Republicans beat historical average for midterm elections.
[03:51:42.111 --> 03:51:46.613]  A recent analysis of historical trends noted over the past 28 midterm elections since 1906,
[03:51:48.168 --> 03:51:53.193]  The President's party lost about 30 House seats and 4 Senate seats on average.
[03:51:53.193 --> 03:52:00.640]  So of course with Trump gaining the Senate seats, he's beaten that average despite the fact that we were told this blue wave was coming.
[03:52:00.640 --> 03:52:03.963]  You know, the endless screaming in the sky, the temper tantrums.
[03:52:03.963 --> 03:52:04.584]  Oh yeah, by the way,
[03:52:05.589 --> 03:52:12.631]  Isn't it disgusting to see all those Trump supporters last night and today out rioting on the streets because Democrats won the House?
[03:52:12.631 --> 03:52:13.332]  Isn't that this?
[03:52:13.332 --> 03:52:14.652]  Oh no, it's actually not happening.
[03:52:14.652 --> 03:52:20.614]  It's only leftists who have violent public temper tantrums when they lose Democratic elections.
[03:52:20.614 --> 03:52:22.675]  It's only that crowd that does that, isn't it?
[03:52:23.155 --> 03:52:25.996]  Because they are, in many cases, a violent mob.
[03:52:25.996 --> 03:52:30.296]  Don't see any Trump riots tonight, like we saw after 2016.
[03:52:30.296 --> 03:52:39.538]  Smashing windows, burning things down, attacking Trump supporters, dragging them out of vehicles, as we saw in the media aftermath of November 2016.
[03:52:39.538 --> 03:52:42.379]  It's all quiet on that front, isn't it?
[03:52:42.379 --> 03:52:45.159]  Interesting to note that difference.
[03:52:45.159 --> 03:52:48.220]  Let's move on to some weird news now.
[03:52:48.220 --> 03:52:49.640]  This is out of the Daily Mail.
[03:52:49.640 --> 03:52:51.941]  Pensioner 69, who identifies as a 45 year old,
[03:52:53.863 --> 03:52:58.206]  Begins legal action to have his age reduced so he can attract more women on Tinder.
[03:52:58.206 --> 03:53:00.727]  This is a 69-year-old Dutchman.
[03:53:00.727 --> 03:53:19.540]  By the way, Holland, I think it was the first country in the world, or one of the first at least a few weeks ago, to legally allow transgender people to state the fact that they're transgender on their official government documents, including passports, where I think they've just like put an XX for transgender.
[03:53:19.540 --> 03:53:20.500]  So now a 69-year-old Dutchman
[03:53:22.190 --> 03:53:27.675]  He's battling to legally reduce his age by 20 years so he can get more work and attract more women on Tinder.
[03:53:27.675 --> 03:53:33.500]  And who are you to say he can't do that, you disgusting bigot?
[03:53:33.500 --> 03:53:35.381]  Trans age is here.
[03:53:35.381 --> 03:53:36.062]  It has arrived.
[03:53:36.062 --> 03:53:46.431]  Emile Rattleband argues that if transgender people are allowed to change sex, he should be allowed to change his date of birth because doctors said he has the body of a 45-year-old.
[03:53:46.431 --> 03:53:48.853]  And who is anyone else to tell him that he's wrong?
[03:53:50.091 --> 03:53:57.899]  The motivational speaker, media personality in the Netherlands, is suing his local authority after they refused to amend his age on official documents.
[03:53:57.899 --> 03:54:06.327]  When again, as I just said a few weeks ago, the Netherlands became, I think it was the first European country to allow people to identify as transgender on their official documents.
[03:54:07.228 --> 03:54:10.651]  People will ask, does that have any more credence than this?
[03:54:10.651 --> 03:54:14.454]  Someone identifying as 20 years younger than they really are.
[03:54:14.454 --> 03:54:16.336]  Now he's obviously doing it for a stunt.
[03:54:16.336 --> 03:54:28.846]  He doesn't really believe that he's 20 years younger than he is, but it's funny nonetheless because his argument is basically the same as transgender people when they legally attempt to change their gender.
[03:54:28.846 --> 03:54:29.467]  In Sweden,
[03:54:30.600 --> 03:54:36.004]  Father of Stockholm terror victim claims illegal migrant repeatedly vandalised his daughter's grave.
[03:54:36.004 --> 03:54:45.151]  This was the 11-year-old victim of that horrendous terror attack in Stockholm last year, where the guy ploughed the truck into a group of people.
[03:54:45.151 --> 03:54:49.595]  An 11-year-old girl, Ebba Ackland, obviously tragically died during that terrorist attack.
[03:54:50.433 --> 03:54:58.679]  Now according to this story, her grave has been vandalised by an illegal migrant no less than 30 times.
[03:54:58.679 --> 03:55:04.043]  What kind of monster would want to vandalise a child's grave?
[03:55:04.043 --> 03:55:08.787]  No less a child that was the victim of a horrendous terror attack.
[03:55:08.787 --> 03:55:15.332]  I mean people remember seeing the pictures of her body in the aftermath of that attack and it was absolutely harrowing and now
[03:55:16.215 --> 03:55:30.411]  The migrant who has not been identified is alleged by Mr. Ackland, the father of this 11-year-old girl, to have been given a prior deportation order and is supposed to be banned from the country until 2019, but remains in Sweden.
[03:55:30.411 --> 03:55:32.994]  So again, we see violent criminals.
[03:55:32.994 --> 03:55:36.819]  We saw the pathological altruism case a few months ago.
[03:55:37.563 --> 03:55:49.354]  Where the guy on the plane had literally tried to strangle his wife and kids with a power cord, you had the left-wing refugee activist on the plane literally grounding the plane to prevent him from being deported.
[03:55:50.518 --> 03:55:56.342]  You have hard-working migrants in Sweden who actually start up businesses, who employ people, who actually integrate.
[03:55:56.342 --> 03:56:00.005]  They get deported because a little bit of paperwork went wrong.
[03:56:00.005 --> 03:56:08.831]  This guy's still in the country, an illegal migrant, allegedly vandalizing a child's grave 30 times, and he's got evidence of it.
[03:56:08.831 --> 03:56:10.032]  It's in the article.
[03:56:10.032 --> 03:56:10.972]  Nothing happens.
[03:56:10.972 --> 03:56:14.295]  That's why Sweden is an absolute joke.
[03:56:14.295 --> 03:56:18.958]  Also in Sweden, Swedish police recruit migrant police officers from crime-ridden Nogo area.
[03:56:20.106 --> 03:56:26.415]  The Swedish police have serious plans to recruit police officers from Rinkeby, a crime-ridden migrant suburb in Stockholm.
[03:56:26.415 --> 03:56:29.319]  This is one of those suburbs where you've all seen the footage.
[03:56:29.319 --> 03:56:35.047]  The media goes in there with cameras, they're physically assaulted, they're attacked, they're hit, they get rocks thrown at them.
[03:56:36.405 --> 03:56:38.326]  The police stations there are attacked.
[03:56:38.326 --> 03:56:44.591]  They're having to reinforce the existing police stations, refusing to build new ones because they're just constantly attacked.
[03:56:44.591 --> 03:56:48.754]  Grenade attacks, rising crime, rape rates through the roof.
[03:56:48.754 --> 03:56:55.278]  So their solution is to recruit some of these migrants from the same area to try and police the other migrants.
[03:56:55.278 --> 03:56:56.839]  That's how bad it's got.
[03:56:56.839 --> 03:57:03.784]  You remember the movie Clockwork Orange, where the Droogs eventually became the police so they could police the other Droogs.
[03:57:03.784 --> 03:57:05.946]  That's literally what's happening in Sweden right now.
[03:57:06.608 --> 03:57:09.109]  Over in Italy we have better news.
[03:57:09.109 --> 03:57:13.451]  Salvini wins, Italian Senate approves new law to make deportation of migrants easier.
[03:57:13.451 --> 03:57:21.735]  They have approved this new law to more easily deport convicted asylum seekers by a vote of 163 to 59.
[03:57:21.735 --> 03:57:32.941]  So unlike Sweden, which likes to keep its violent illegal migrant criminals on shore, domestic, Italy is finally making moves to deport them and make Italy safe again.
[03:57:33.801 --> 03:57:36.623]  That's going to wrap it up for the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:57:36.623 --> 03:57:38.724]  Coming up next, War Room Live.
[03:57:38.724 --> 03:57:39.484]  Don't miss it.
[03:57:39.484 --> 03:57:43.267]  Breaking news at InfoWars.com.
[03:57:43.267 --> 03:57:47.169]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[03:57:48.522 --> 03:57:57.205]  Infowars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt Justice Department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[03:57:57.205 --> 03:57:59.186]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[03:57:59.186 --> 03:58:02.647]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[03:58:02.647 --> 03:58:05.268]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[03:58:05.268 --> 03:58:07.548]  So we've already had incredible success.
[03:58:07.548 --> 03:58:14.511]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is, and understand how real this fight is, and why we've been made the main target,
[03:58:15.051 --> 03:58:24.833]  And if you financially support us, and if you spread the word about our articles and videos at InfoWars.com, we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags.
[03:58:24.833 --> 03:58:26.034]  We'll win.
[03:58:26.034 --> 03:58:28.834]  We have huge sales at InfoWarsStore.com right now.
[03:58:28.834 --> 03:58:34.256]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you, despite the Fed trying to block our commerce.
[03:58:34.256 --> 03:58:36.076]  And you're right, to the market.
[03:58:36.076 --> 03:58:39.777]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros the Globalist may win.
[03:58:39.777 --> 03:58:41.338]  This is InfoWars Darkness Hour.
[03:58:41.338 --> 03:58:42.198]  We need your support.
[03:58:42.198 --> 03:58:42.738]  I'm counting on you.
[03:58:44.170 --> 03:58:46.891]  Stress is a natural part of life.
[03:58:46.891 --> 03:58:53.213]  Work, family, friends, and everyday accidents can put a lot of strain on the body and your mood.
[03:58:53.213 --> 03:58:54.973]  Don't let life weigh you down.

[03:59:22.530 --> 03:59:24.671]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
