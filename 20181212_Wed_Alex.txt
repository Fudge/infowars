[00:00.000 --> 00:24.000]  you are listening to an info wars dot com frontline report it's alex jones
[00:24.000 --> 00:30.000]  google's world headquarters it's they've now officially moved to china it's on fire right now
[00:30.000 --> 00:36.240]  your radio listener we have the live feeds at info wars dot com and news wars dot com
[00:37.040 --> 00:42.720]  there's a large explosion in the building and now it's got a hundred foot tall red flames
[00:42.720 --> 00:49.600]  shooting out of the top of it a google executive was found dead yesterday in new york all sorts of
[00:49.600 --> 00:57.760]  things are going on behind the scenes obviously the head of google the ceo sundar ran from us
[00:57.760 --> 01:01.680]  when we were simply pointing out that dragonfly is already operational it's totally illegal
[01:01.680 --> 01:06.880]  they're helping round up political dissidents but the big story is that sundar perjured himself
[01:06.880 --> 01:16.320]  spec patlily we have so much evidence of google premeditated censorship of nationalist
[01:16.320 --> 01:23.520]  conservatives christians you name it that it's like saying we have sand at the seashore but just
[01:23.520 --> 01:29.520]  in the last day more documents are coming out more emails and google's number one threat they
[01:29.520 --> 01:36.000]  admit is leakers people inside google not believing the incredible authoritarianism that they're
[01:36.000 --> 01:42.640]  witnessing and they're going public and they're speaking out you have to understand that google
[01:42.640 --> 01:51.920]  is an ai super weapon it is a system that gets the whole world to opt into it so it can then
[01:51.920 --> 01:57.120]  gain stock markets economies it can then predict what you're going to do with almost total certainty
[01:57.120 --> 02:02.880]  before you do it and there's a race between facebook and amazon and apple with google
[02:03.600 --> 02:10.080]  even though they're all very incestuous and work in and out of each other to build the first global
[02:10.080 --> 02:14.720]  ai system that they believe will then take over all the markets and take over society and it's
[02:14.720 --> 02:19.520]  basically already happened google is the top of the pyramid right there with apple
[02:21.360 --> 02:28.400]  and google's helping in dozens and dozens of islamic countries you name it suppress the
[02:28.400 --> 02:35.680]  population they tailor the censorship to what the governments want and now that it's admitted
[02:35.680 --> 02:41.920]  that's going on russia said okay we've got a bunch of sites that we want banned that we say
[02:41.920 --> 02:48.160]  george soros is funding try to overthrow eastern european countries and overthrow russia and so
[02:48.160 --> 02:55.040]  you see how this snowball starts going downhill to where everything is censored add to all of that
[02:57.040 --> 02:58.640]  the ultra massive news
[02:58.640 --> 03:05.760]  that you have macron set tomorrow for a no confidence vote maybe removed from office probably
[03:05.760 --> 03:10.880]  will be you've got theresa may set for a no confidence vote today you're seeing the fall of
[03:10.880 --> 03:16.960]  the new world order remember what happened a month ago germany had its sixth election in a row
[03:17.840 --> 03:21.920]  took six elections to get merkel's party out of power because they got over 20 big parties
[03:21.920 --> 03:30.080]  so they have coalitions but now she's a lame duck she's still the chancellor in the parliamentary
[03:30.080 --> 03:33.760]  system but she has no power and you see the globalist being thrown out in brazil
[03:35.520 --> 03:40.000]  in iceland in the uk i mean can i keep listening all this you see what trump's doing
[03:40.000 --> 03:45.280]  it's happening all the world we're on the march the empire is on the run but the globalists
[03:45.280 --> 03:52.640]  are counter striking right now in a big big big way with economic warfare they're threatening the
[03:52.640 --> 04:02.240]  uk the u.s spain idly brazil japan south korea anyone that sides with the united states in a
[04:02.240 --> 04:08.320]  free market free future is being threatened by the authoritarian e u that is in league
[04:09.040 --> 04:13.680]  with the chikops and the axis of evil with the hollywood trash and the rest of them so
[04:13.680 --> 04:20.240]  this is the fight for this country this is the real deal and people better decide which side
[04:20.240 --> 04:25.840]  they're on there's only patriots and globalists there's only people that are pro-human future
[04:25.840 --> 04:35.360]  people that want a globalist future it's all coming up ladies and gentlemen unbelievable
[04:35.360 --> 04:47.120]  perjury by sundar sundar the liar it's all coming up today this world is now in global crisis the
[04:47.120 --> 04:52.720]  lives of which it's never seen but humanity's coming back hard from behind and is about to take
[04:52.720 --> 04:56.960]  the pole position against the technocrats the battle is now
[05:00.080 --> 05:04.480]  the globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of
[05:04.480 --> 05:09.920]  the bad halogens fluoride chlorine bromide you name it that it lowers IQ it literally
[05:10.560 --> 05:15.600]  dumps the population down and on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine
[05:15.600 --> 05:21.680]  in the world we've gone through two permutations first seaweed based iodine that was pretty good
[05:21.680 --> 05:26.160]  but hard to source and the globalist tried to block us getting a supply of it so we discovered
[05:26.160 --> 05:32.160]  deep earth crystals a pure nascent iodine and brought you x2 that's been incredible now due
[05:32.160 --> 05:36.960]  to the establishment trying to block that we did more research and secured more of the deep
[05:36.960 --> 05:42.160]  earth crystals of nascent iodine but chemists scientists and others showed us the research
[05:42.160 --> 05:48.960]  that by combining it with three other compounds two forms of iodine and vitamin c it super charges it
[05:48.960 --> 05:54.960]  and makes it even more bio available ladies and gentlemen you want to research it you want to see
[05:54.960 --> 06:10.880]  it it's an incredible discovery x3 now available at infowarslife.com
[06:14.080 --> 06:22.240]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well so does he
[06:22.240 --> 06:26.960]  live from the infowars.com studios it's alex jones
[06:37.440 --> 06:42.320]  i'm not saying that just control yourself okay get under control now i'm under control thank you
[06:42.320 --> 06:46.720]  i just was he's taking my free speech away and lied about me so i need to stand up to him i'm not
[06:46.720 --> 06:49.520]  worried about that right now i'm gonna talk about me in this yes i understand they're gonna talk about
[06:49.520 --> 06:53.760]  me in this committee i will be talked about so what am i supposed to do i don't get a dating
[06:53.760 --> 06:59.680]  court they lie about me google only puts lies up all the top searches are lies about me and my family
[06:59.680 --> 07:03.520]  and that guy helps round up political dissidents and then his people come to lie to congress over
[07:04.560 --> 07:08.960]  and over and over again and we don't get to respond to them so google is helping build
[07:08.960 --> 07:14.320]  censorship systems in china for a global social score they tested there to totally control every
[07:14.320 --> 07:23.200]  aspect of our lives apple ladies and gentlemen we are live broadcasting worldwide on December 12
[07:23.840 --> 07:30.720]  2018 i'm alex jones on this wednesday edition back in the command base cockpit
[07:31.840 --> 07:38.640]  here in the crow's nest in the atx very honored to be here with you well all things are google
[07:38.640 --> 07:46.720]  aren't they the global DARPA controlled and DARPA designed advanced research project into a human
[07:47.280 --> 07:54.400]  mass machine interface to be able to predict the future and then control the future that's in the
[07:54.400 --> 08:03.040]  founding documents of google 1997 1998 i was told about this by high-level nsa whistleblowers
[08:03.040 --> 08:11.360]  in the mid 90s as it was being set up and prepared and it was in wired magazine four years ago
[08:11.360 --> 08:17.440]  they actually released the quote classified google documents admitting that when they were getting
[08:17.440 --> 08:21.680]  cia funding and nsa funding they're saying we already have search engines this is nsa technology
[08:21.680 --> 08:26.400]  they said no we're gonna get humans to interface with it with their hopes their dreams all their
[08:26.400 --> 08:31.840]  actions dialing into all the other machines and computers and have a lifetime model of the world
[08:31.840 --> 08:38.320]  called hooked into gps everything the internet of things to then be able to predict the future
[08:39.200 --> 08:42.720]  and then be able to control the future
[08:46.240 --> 08:54.320]  and now here we are now there's a big phenomenon unfolding everywhere i go everywhere i go
[08:54.320 --> 09:02.080]  go people walk up to me on the street they walk up to me in airports they walked up this morning it
[09:02.080 --> 09:10.640]  happened a gentleman walked up to me with his wife and he said alex i didn't used to believe you but
[09:11.200 --> 09:16.080]  i'll be talking about something that i've never talked about before by my home computer or are on
[09:16.080 --> 09:22.720]  my phone and then i will get google ads for it and he said that i went and looked it up on your
[09:22.720 --> 09:27.520]  site and you guys had articles in 2006 where google told shareholders they were already doing it and
[09:27.520 --> 09:36.080]  i'm like yes i know and now there's a race between samsung and apple and google and twitter and facebook
[09:36.080 --> 09:43.120]  and and and and again amazon's there to get assistance alexa these devices into your house
[09:43.120 --> 09:50.320]  that listen and watch now everything you do and everyone is now calling me saying alex you gotta
[09:50.320 --> 09:56.640]  cover it it's there's tv commercials admitting that's listening to it all times and there's murder
[09:56.640 --> 10:02.880]  cases where the judges are ordering amazon and apple and google with their devices give you the
[10:02.880 --> 10:10.160]  home recordings going back years and they're turning over years of recordings and convicting people of
[10:10.160 --> 10:16.880]  murder with them there are cases where a husband kills his wife it's a couple of these in the news
[10:16.880 --> 10:23.920]  this month and the dumb idiot didn't tell the cops that a mugger did it all they do is go get it from
[10:23.920 --> 10:34.000]  whatever device they had they're recording everything people and yes i told you this i told
[10:34.000 --> 10:38.720]  everybody this 20 years ago but it wasn't because i knew it i was told this by high-level people
[10:38.720 --> 10:47.760]  and it was later all confirmed so people are exonerating themselves with the nsa recordings
[10:47.760 --> 10:52.560]  they're going to prison with the nsa recordings more and more people are filing in federal cases
[10:53.280 --> 10:58.080]  to prove what they really said on a phone call to get the nsa recordings federal courts are set
[10:58.080 --> 11:04.000]  to start ruling that you'll get them so we've gone from none of this is happening
[11:04.000 --> 11:17.200]  to the phenomenon of alexa and the google assistant and all of these systems watching and listening
[11:17.200 --> 11:22.560]  and now they're saying they're going to babysit your children and we're just accepting it and
[11:22.560 --> 11:29.840]  then imagine the power it gives to a sundar of google who got up before congress and said
[11:29.840 --> 11:40.400]  lies that were so over the top that were so insane that i couldn't believe my eyeballs
[11:43.040 --> 11:48.000]  i'm going to give you the big secret about google not just that it's the preeminent ai grid
[11:48.000 --> 11:52.160]  the most hooked-in system that can predict the future that's been announced for a while we told
[11:52.160 --> 12:00.240]  you first you notice facebook now says oh the next phase it is will predict where you're going to be
[12:00.240 --> 12:06.720]  next well amazon four years ago released that they can predict with 99 accuracy prime users
[12:06.720 --> 12:11.200]  what you're going to order before you order it and already have it packaged and ready waiting
[12:12.320 --> 12:14.480]  for the robot to go pull it off the shelf and mail it
[12:14.480 --> 12:25.600]  but here's the big future about google and about what they're planning and about what
[12:25.600 --> 12:32.320]  they're going to do next is take over the driving cars the self-driving cars take control of the
[12:32.320 --> 12:37.040]  military take control everything because it'll all be so advanced nothing will even be able to
[12:37.040 --> 12:44.240]  compete with it everything else will be obsolete so we're allowing them to position us into a position
[12:45.040 --> 12:50.240]  into a space where we've allowed ourselves to be put in a digital prison that they just call
[12:51.920 --> 12:58.560]  progress they call the algorithm sundar gets up there and says oh we don't run any of it now
[12:58.560 --> 13:03.840]  it's the algorithm that is a total fraud they design the algorithms for the outcomes they want
[13:03.840 --> 13:11.600]  and they use giant engines of bots that are trillions of times bigger than what the russians
[13:11.600 --> 13:18.720]  have literally to control the algorithms and manipulate the algorithms not just of google
[13:18.720 --> 13:24.160]  but of all these other companies and systems and competing ai programs so what we're really in
[13:24.160 --> 13:30.560]  here's the big secret is an ai war we're already deep into the ai war of the 21st century these
[13:30.560 --> 13:35.520]  things are already artificially intelligent the question is when will they become if not already
[13:37.920 --> 13:44.080]  conscious self-aware sentient now they'll never really become sentient but the system's going to
[13:44.080 --> 13:50.480]  call it sentient they already act like a lie detector you can easily you know get around or
[13:50.480 --> 13:57.280]  cheat on not just the person taking it the person giving it can cheat and it's not an exact science
[13:57.280 --> 14:02.880]  so it's been proven to be a fraud well but people what does the death penalty with this by the thousands
[14:02.880 --> 14:10.880]  and it's a fraud well now you'll just have fancy oracles that are supposedly ai and they can tell
[14:10.880 --> 14:15.200]  you anything going on in the world because you opt into it and you interface with it
[14:18.640 --> 14:26.880]  so every metric shows these ai systems are making us stupider they're making us weaker sundar doesn't
[14:26.880 --> 14:32.000]  have google assist in his house he doesn't have any other system where you bring a little robot
[14:32.000 --> 14:38.720]  into your house to watch and listen to you steve jobs didn't let anybody in his family have him
[14:39.360 --> 14:43.840]  bill gates doesn't let his children have any other stuff they're all given classical educations
[14:43.840 --> 14:52.000]  cursive handwriting because this is a weapon system against you this is a system to make you
[14:52.000 --> 14:57.840]  obsolete and then the master engineers that got us to opt into it they travel on into the future
[14:59.120 --> 15:04.480]  they pick the flicker rates for the screens to mesmerize you be classified they pick everything
[15:04.480 --> 15:12.160]  about it to trigger dopamine response and pavlovian triggers and so when you want to know what the
[15:12.160 --> 15:18.720]  ultimate form of mind control is the 21st century it's these so-called phones that have all the
[15:18.720 --> 15:26.720]  sensors tracking everything you say everything you do and now you have the new superclass the
[15:26.720 --> 15:32.320]  few big tech heads who have access to all of this information and google was asked a tricky question
[15:32.320 --> 15:37.040]  they said you're not the government are you google they said we don't really see ourselves as that
[15:37.040 --> 15:42.480]  and sundar look down because these tech companies already see themselves as the global governance
[15:42.480 --> 15:48.960]  system you've got these archaic congresses of arrogant lawyers who play golf all day who don't
[15:48.960 --> 15:54.800]  get how they've been rubbed but there's still time to wake up and take control of it but trump
[15:54.800 --> 15:59.040]  the american people in the military have to take action by the way google headquarters is on fire

[20:43.680 --> 20:50.640]  headquarters is burst of flames a massive fire erupted in a google office in china sending dangerous
[20:50.640 --> 20:56.400]  black glooms of smoke rising in the air the furious blaze was first reported 11 m local time in
[20:56.400 --> 21:03.520]  wednesday in zhong gong con tech district also is china silicon valley in beijing and it's their
[21:03.520 --> 21:09.600]  headquarters in china the fire took place in tower b of ray com info tech park according to
[21:09.600 --> 21:19.120]  state newspaper the global times and a google executive was found dead in new york and google
[21:19.120 --> 21:27.920]  offices of interesting things going on over at google these days and i'm going to the next
[21:27.920 --> 21:36.400]  hour play congressional clips and then go through the evidence of sundar pachai perjuring himself
[21:37.440 --> 21:44.720]  at a level that when you're informed is unbelievable and easily all of it proven to be a fraud
[21:44.720 --> 21:54.000]  we have the videos of the day after villary lost november 9th 2016
[21:56.560 --> 22:00.560]  and it's got all the executives including sundar
[22:02.720 --> 22:05.520]  because they have these conference rooms that look like a university
[22:05.520 --> 22:14.080]  amphitheater and they're all there talking and they're saying oh my god we tried to help
[22:14.080 --> 22:18.640]  hillary win but we didn't do enough we're not going to allow this to happen again we're going to
[22:18.640 --> 22:24.640]  censor the hell out of conservatives and nationalists and they're working with the southern
[22:24.640 --> 22:29.680]  property law center and the adl and media matters and soros funds it and it's in the wiki leaks and
[22:29.680 --> 22:36.720]  there's all of the emails of eric schmitt to hillary saying we're going to put you in office
[22:36.720 --> 22:41.680]  and we're 100 behind you google had an office in the white house for eight years with obama
[22:42.240 --> 22:48.800]  there's all the photos of them vacationing together the head of the big five tech companies
[22:48.800 --> 22:54.400]  would go on vacation repeatedly with obama
[22:54.400 --> 23:01.680]  and reportedly they take drugs they've got all the hookers male female they have orgies together
[23:02.400 --> 23:06.400]  and some of that's come out in the news about the google executives they have wide body
[23:06.400 --> 23:12.800]  jumbo jets with bedrooms all in them and and there's been videotape where like 15
[23:12.800 --> 23:17.520]  hookers are loaded on and i mean the whole point is they're in their own world they want their
[23:17.520 --> 23:23.600]  privacy but you don't get privacy eric schmitt puts women on his planes like michael jackson
[23:23.600 --> 23:30.320]  would have kids with veils over their heads and the parent company of google is alphabet
[23:34.560 --> 23:40.080]  and congressman nadler who was literally reading off a script written by google about
[23:40.080 --> 23:45.520]  how there's no bias against conservatives was involved in the premeditated perjury with sundar
[23:45.520 --> 23:55.920]  and it turns out he gets on average 26 000 a year from google so he's on their payroll but
[23:56.560 --> 24:00.800]  i want to digress into all the other news because it's really important obviously
[24:02.960 --> 24:08.160]  but the fact that they just rolled out for at least the last
[24:08.160 --> 24:25.120]  12 years it's longer than that 14 years for 14 years google in official company
[24:25.760 --> 24:32.480]  shareholder communications that aren't secret but they're restricted we got them 2006
[24:32.480 --> 24:38.000]  in full wars dot com prison planet dot com google to use microphones and cameras embedded in phones
[24:38.880 --> 24:45.280]  smartphones and computers to watch and listen to you and to use keyword analysis to then give
[24:45.280 --> 24:55.760]  targeted ads i still can't get the general public to admit it's happening when it's on the news every
[24:55.760 --> 25:03.680]  day that all these google assists and alexis and are listening and watching you because we're america
[25:03.680 --> 25:08.320]  that isn't going on you're wrong zones we're not going to admit you were right 20 years ago
[25:08.320 --> 25:13.520]  20 years ago i've been covering this it's 1996 that's longer than 20 years ago
[25:15.440 --> 25:21.600]  now they go oh are they well yes they do have patents and they say they could but google won't
[25:21.600 --> 25:31.040]  answer the question give me a break give me a break so let me tell you what's coming next
[25:31.040 --> 25:37.280]  and we're going to go to break them back in all of the nation google has 90 plus percent of all
[25:37.280 --> 25:42.640]  the searches they've got over half the advertising on the planet now they are getting into every
[25:42.640 --> 25:48.320]  faction and system of supply chain they have bragged and internal memos that they can deliver
[25:48.320 --> 25:54.880]  elections to whoever the the political structure wants them to they've been caught doing it here
[25:55.920 --> 25:58.160]  clearly skewing the election in the midterms
[26:00.960 --> 26:07.360]  and then they get up there before congress with a straight face and tell the world
[26:09.760 --> 26:16.640]  and tell the world that none of it's happening and the most sickening thing with sundar saying
[26:16.640 --> 26:27.040]  when you turn the location off on your phone we don't follow you anymore no they just don't
[26:27.040 --> 26:31.680]  give you the service they admit internal documents it's been in the news that they still track you
[26:31.680 --> 26:37.120]  of course they do google was caught 12 years ago with their cars driving around for street view
[26:37.120 --> 26:42.240]  that was a cover that was just one thing they were doing they had all those antennas grabbing
[26:42.240 --> 26:47.680]  all your pass codes and all your wireless data and then putting it into ai to then break into
[26:47.680 --> 26:53.520]  your computers and why not if you're going to go ahead and spy on people with microphones and
[26:53.520 --> 26:58.400]  cameras and not tell them why wouldn't you steal their passcode why wouldn't you move to communist
[26:58.400 --> 27:02.480]  china why wouldn't you help build a censorship system for the communist party they've been using
[27:02.480 --> 27:07.040]  for years that's about to go nationwide and why not tell congress i don't know anything about
[27:07.040 --> 27:12.320]  dragonfly we we have lots of projects we don't intend to go live with that meanwhile their internal
[27:12.320 --> 27:16.880]  emails have been released they're like find out whoever did this and ask them this is our most
[27:16.880 --> 27:22.720]  secret project listed top secret beta testing for the rest of the world we're competing with apple
[27:22.720 --> 27:29.360]  for the global social id and google is not going to let apple get the global social id we are going
[27:29.360 --> 27:43.280]  to rule the planet our ai system is superior that's what's going on and they're all in an
[27:43.280 --> 27:49.440]  illegal race to get everyone wired in and everyone dialed in and the smartphone companies all spent
[27:49.440 --> 27:57.280]  billions with universities through darpa to get the exact flicker rate with the phones the exact
[27:57.280 --> 28:08.000]  screen flicker rate to put you into a trance and then they admit they're doing it this is mind
[28:08.560 --> 28:18.160]  control mind control to major tom it's here and then sundar is walking around because he
[28:18.160 --> 28:23.680]  doesn't respect congress he doesn't respect you he doesn't respect anybody he'll do whatever he
[28:23.680 --> 28:29.280]  wants with those big evil globalists like eric schmitt and obama up there above them who are on
[28:29.280 --> 28:36.000]  a power mad ego trip and who believe they can do whatever they want and they admit that those
[28:36.000 --> 28:43.920]  executives are all taking super complex weird ass drugs and having constant weird sex and rituals
[28:43.920 --> 28:50.560]  and they're all just micro dosing lsd and mushrooms almost every day and they are wiped out of their
[28:50.560 --> 28:55.920]  minds and they believe they're going to build an ai god they merge with but first all of us have to

[31:38.240 --> 31:43.840]  right to the chase human liberty a pro-human future versus the globalist anti-human future

[31:57.360 --> 32:03.280]  and funding info war a true 360 win in the last few months info wars has been escalating our sales
[32:03.280 --> 32:08.000]  to clear out inventory of many of our best-selling items and then i came up with the idea last week
[32:08.000 --> 32:12.480]  let's not just extend the sale of free shipping storewide 50 to 75 percent off double patriot
[32:12.480 --> 32:19.600]  points let's extend that sale but also add a free gift with every order even if it's a
[32:19.600 --> 32:24.560]  tube of fluoride free colloidal silver iodine four to five super blue you'll get a free gift
[32:24.560 --> 32:29.600]  of a best-selling t-shirt while supplies last and what i mean by that is everyone will get a
[32:29.600 --> 32:34.720]  t-shirt but these are going to be selling out so whatever you order that day they'll be the shirt
[32:34.720 --> 32:38.800]  of the day that's there until it sells out then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the
[32:38.800 --> 32:44.000]  next group of orders so in the next 12 days we are going to have beyond any other sale we've
[32:44.000 --> 32:49.440]  ever had so this is a loss leader we are losing money on this this is our biggest sale ever get
[32:49.440 --> 32:53.920]  your free gift your free shipping everything and don't fight the crowds info war store dot com

[33:30.080 --> 33:34.800]  live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones
[33:34.800 --> 33:43.680]  all right we have the hd footage of myself confronting congressman swallows well congressman
[33:43.680 --> 33:50.000]  deutch congressman hank johnson who's actually quite nice couldn't help but like to go i'm not
[33:50.000 --> 33:56.800]  an even person uh that's all coming up and and of course the sundar hachai confrontation in hd
[33:57.440 --> 34:01.360]  all the stuff he saw was live streamed some of the audio was hammered but we have the hd now
[34:01.360 --> 34:05.680]  because we're back we were able to premiere it here that's next segment but let me direct you
[34:06.400 --> 34:11.840]  to something really frightening quite frankly and you know we need to know who's behind this
[34:11.840 --> 34:17.440]  we need to know if this goes down the way we said it would uh that the people that engineered it
[34:18.160 --> 34:22.320]  should get the blame and not president trump not capitalism not nationalism
[34:24.080 --> 34:29.200]  member bill marr saying we need to plunge the economy to stop trump the federal reserve
[34:29.200 --> 34:34.480]  raised interest rates seven times and announced five bigger ones coming and the stock market has
[34:34.480 --> 34:38.480]  started going down since then now they've had all these globalists CEOs and others
[34:39.040 --> 34:42.720]  weigh in and say the economy is going to go under and now we've had members of congress
[34:42.720 --> 34:46.800]  saying we're going to regulate we're going to bring in more regulations we're going to roll
[34:46.800 --> 34:52.240]  back all the regulations uh that trump rolled back we're going to bring those back and these
[34:52.240 --> 34:58.320]  committees we're going to remove trump we're going to arrest his ass well that's hurt the markets
[34:58.320 --> 35:03.840]  globally and this is what our president gets when he tries to do better trade deals for us
[35:06.080 --> 35:10.880]  the communist chinese the eu promised to plunge our market and now they're working with the
[35:10.880 --> 35:14.400]  federal reserve to do it but the federal reserve's majority owned by european banks
[35:14.400 --> 35:21.440]  to begin with that's why in 2008 79 percent this came out congressional hearings of the money went
[35:21.440 --> 35:27.920]  to foreign european banks of the bailout just type in the majority of money from the 2008 bailout
[35:27.920 --> 35:35.360]  went to foreign banks types that in you can also type in even though trillions went to foreign banks
[35:35.360 --> 35:43.440]  of the bailout the first trunks being 860 billion it's secret exactly who got it remember all that
[35:44.560 --> 35:50.160]  remember all that so this is what we're dealing with so so so here's drudgesreport.com
[35:50.160 --> 35:58.000]  we can put up on screen for folks and you notice there on drudgesreport.com
[36:01.200 --> 36:10.400]  that it says debt poised to hit 22 trillion dollars and it's an excellent michael snider article
[36:13.040 --> 36:18.240]  where he lays it all out and where he links to the government's own numbers
[36:18.240 --> 36:23.280]  now under that story on drudgesreport.com it's the top story on drudgesreport.com
[36:23.280 --> 36:29.440]  it's an info wars dot com repost of michael sniders excellent work most cfos see recession
[36:30.000 --> 36:34.880]  coming see financial officers homelessness on rise in some states
[36:37.280 --> 36:42.960]  now you look below that mail away or stay uk in disarray vote today
[36:42.960 --> 36:48.240]  Theresa may they have a no confidence vote set will let you know as soon as that happens in
[36:48.240 --> 36:54.160]  parliament to remove her as the prime minister because she thought she had the votes to do her
[36:54.160 --> 37:01.760]  riggs it's screw job deal that put the uk even more under the control of the unelected european
[37:01.760 --> 37:08.320]  union dictatorship oh and who else is in trouble macron is having a no confidence vote tomorrow
[37:08.320 --> 37:17.600]  and most french papers say they believe he'll be gone he's praised open borders he covers up for
[37:17.600 --> 37:24.000]  his lonic terror he massively raises taxes on the working class he's a monster he's a globalist so
[37:24.000 --> 37:27.760]  it's another rebuke of them and what are they threatening france within the news what are
[37:27.760 --> 37:33.200]  they threatening the uk within the news what are they threatening spain with in idli it's all over
[37:33.200 --> 37:38.480]  the news financial times if you try to pull out of the euro and if you try to pull out of carbon
[37:38.480 --> 37:48.640]  taxes we're gonna plunge your economy it's economic terrorism period and so there it all is ladies and
[37:48.640 --> 37:54.320]  gentlemen and we're being maneuvered into this and the eu was bubbling their debt the chinese
[37:54.320 --> 38:01.680]  were leading the global bubble trump knew that and knew that this plan was being carried out
[38:01.680 --> 38:06.160]  so he said we better get some industry back because we're going into a war in the future we better get
[38:06.160 --> 38:10.960]  our core steel and aluminum back we better get american pride back we better at least we're
[38:10.960 --> 38:16.720]  gonna have this big bubble get some of that bubble money to the general public instead of all the
[38:16.720 --> 38:22.560]  bubble money going to the big banks and that's why they're so pissed because trump doesn't want
[38:22.560 --> 38:27.440]  you bankrupted and he believes we can maybe even make it out of this bubble into another
[38:27.440 --> 38:31.920]  high tech bubble if we can get secret technologies released which he's been flogging him to do
[38:31.920 --> 38:35.760]  and all these incredible medical breakthroughs that have been suppressed the only way to get out of a
[38:35.760 --> 38:42.480]  bubble cycle is an incredible new innovation or group of innovations just like nasa and all that
[38:42.480 --> 38:47.760]  technology that's not hype that that led us into the computer generation and and then in the last
[38:47.760 --> 38:53.840]  30 years of innovation we've seen the problem is then that innovation got hijacked has been used
[38:53.840 --> 39:02.480]  for control and bad things but here's the bottom line trump told you i mean my god folks he when
[39:02.480 --> 39:11.120]  he's on an airplane a helicopter or even golfing in between rides to the holes to the green he is
[39:11.120 --> 39:15.040]  on the phone calling ceo's having little five minute conversations two minute conversations
[39:16.960 --> 39:20.560]  saying bet on america we're gonna do it we're gonna get the jobs back i'm gonna roll back
[39:20.560 --> 39:27.200]  the regulations we're gonna create a wave and they believed it they did it but then when they saw
[39:27.200 --> 39:33.680]  the election fraud and they saw the corruption of the democrats people are now saying if america
[39:33.680 --> 39:36.960]  didn't want prosperity and they're still gonna reject trump and we're gonna let the democrats
[39:36.960 --> 39:41.120]  engage in all this fraud then maybe trump really can't pull it out like we thought
[39:42.960 --> 39:47.200]  and i don't think that's the case but people want instant gratification they want it all now
[39:47.200 --> 39:51.120]  done perfectly they all want to sit back and judge trump and feel big about themselves and
[39:51.120 --> 39:54.400]  talk about how incompetent he is when he's done things nobody else has ever done
[39:55.680 --> 39:58.000]  because that's what the average follower likes to do
[40:01.840 --> 40:08.160]  and i i said this a year ago i said it two years ago i said six months ago i said a month ago i said
[40:08.160 --> 40:11.920]  if they're successful plunging the economy will people have a memory
[40:11.920 --> 40:19.680]  that the country was trying to stand up on its own two feet from its death bed
[40:20.960 --> 40:25.360]  and basically the globalists have been like jumping jacks hopping up and down on our shoulders
[40:25.360 --> 40:30.080]  and head trying to drive us into the ground doing everything they can saying they want to hurt the
[40:30.080 --> 40:37.520]  economy and then trump gets the blame instead of the villains and you know if america is that
[40:37.520 --> 40:42.320]  stupid if england's that stupid if scotland's that stupid if italy's that stupid if spain's
[40:42.320 --> 40:46.960]  that stupid if france is that stupid if brazil's that stupid they're threatening the new trump down
[40:46.960 --> 40:53.040]  there with plunging their economy if the public gets mad at a leader who could turn things around
[40:53.040 --> 40:58.240]  and then the globalists come to destroy that to then punish the leader and punish the people do the
[40:58.240 --> 41:03.360]  people get pissed at who's pissing all over them who's running them in the ground who's raping them
[41:03.360 --> 41:07.440]  or do they get pissed at the person that stood up with them and is their brother
[41:10.240 --> 41:15.680]  i think common sense is it makes you love trump more it pisses you off more at the deep state
[41:15.680 --> 41:22.000]  and they're arrogance but you know what there's a large portion of this country
[41:23.520 --> 41:27.280]  that are a bunch of virtue signaling entitled spoiled brats
[41:27.280 --> 41:37.440]  and they just want to be on a bandwagon and feel like they're on a winning football team
[41:38.080 --> 41:42.960]  it's like the people that don't really you know go see a team or listen to them or
[41:42.960 --> 41:46.800]  wear their jerseys until that team starts winning and then suddenly they all go out and buy the
[41:46.800 --> 41:50.240]  jerseys because they want to be on the bandwagon they're not like a fan of a football team where
[41:50.240 --> 41:54.240]  their team didn't make the playoffs for 20 years and then suddenly goes to super bowl
[41:54.240 --> 42:00.320]  see this isn't the super bowl this is america coming back from the dead and other countries
[42:00.320 --> 42:04.800]  fighting for oxygen and fighting for sovereignty and fighting not have the i'm at the world bank
[42:04.800 --> 42:09.760]  and globalists literally destroy their nations and break up their families and bring an ai surveillance
[42:09.760 --> 42:14.400]  control all over the world china's deploying ai surveillance grids all over latin america as well
[42:14.400 --> 42:22.880]  in african human cloning animal human cloning it's all just being done super weapons no no
[42:22.880 --> 42:31.360]  controls totally insane no human rights millions in concentration camps google and apple feverishly
[42:31.360 --> 42:36.720]  helping china do it and then you'll walk down the street of your roger stoner alex jones or
[42:36.720 --> 42:42.000]  donald trump jr and people will roll down her windows go f you you are american russian you're
[42:42.000 --> 42:52.880]  going to prunes come when we're the americans everybody knows it so they're trying to plunge
[42:52.880 --> 42:57.440]  the economy right now they may be successful so you better let everybody you know understand
[42:57.440 --> 43:04.000]  who was the blame living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is the real drama
[43:04.000 --> 43:09.520]  can be found here in leilani estates but a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater and we
[43:09.520 --> 43:15.600]  need to be concerned about ash and acid rain volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles
[43:16.160 --> 43:21.680]  and acid rain could lower the ph of the water to unhealthy levels to find out we employed a
[43:21.680 --> 43:28.400]  series of tests for heavy metals alkalinity and ph what we learned was that there was in fact
[43:28.400 --> 43:34.080]  unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater next we tested the water from our
[43:34.080 --> 43:40.560]  alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure but the ph
[43:40.560 --> 43:47.600]  was also restored to optimal levels as it turns out the filter on the alexa pure raises the ph of
[43:47.600 --> 43:53.280]  the water so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater
[43:53.280 --> 44:00.240]  supply but more importantly a good water filtration system will purify it do you realize that when
[44:00.240 --> 44:05.760]  you spread the links from info wars dot com when you spread the videos you are changing the world

[47:40.400 --> 47:45.840]  point somebody decides they're going to scroll past that and go find alex jones so if they were looking
[47:45.840 --> 47:50.880]  for him let's be about that he's that man's threat to this country there's a guy on the radio his name
[47:50.880 --> 47:56.320]  is alex jones alex jones there's a lot of controversy around this network about alex jones for
[47:56.320 --> 48:01.440]  example time to stop submitting in this charity it's time to realize that we're being enslaved i heard
[48:01.440 --> 48:07.760]  that on alex jones info wars went even further info wars it's a radio show hosted by alex jones

[48:50.560 --> 48:55.280]  if you are receiving this transmission you are by the way that was like us thank you
[48:56.320 --> 49:01.760]  info wars founder alex jones is calling out alleged collusion between google and democrats
[49:01.760 --> 49:07.680]  as the ceo is there on capitol hill today one america's jack busovic has more from washington
[49:08.560 --> 49:12.400]  here with alex jones the host of info wars alex what was your main message for google and their
[49:12.400 --> 49:16.720]  ceo who is has to find today that we're aware of his lying to congress we're aware of him in the
[49:16.720 --> 49:20.880]  dragonfly project that's already been operational for years inside the chinese government now it's
[49:20.880 --> 49:25.440]  just being rolled out the general public as a control system as their global social score to
[49:25.440 --> 49:31.920]  tie in all the spy grids and control their lives and that we're aware of his authoritarianism we're
[49:31.920 --> 49:36.080]  aware of the lies and we're also aware of the fact that people like congressman nadler who gets
[49:36.080 --> 49:40.400]  twenty six thousand dollars a year from alphabet that owns google the parent company is in their
[49:40.400 --> 49:45.760]  pocket and that everything he said today was basically written by their lobbyists we know that
[49:45.760 --> 49:52.560]  and so there is sundar committing perjury and his lawyers and his pr people have clearly written
[49:52.560 --> 49:58.160]  the statements for the democrats to then ask him stage questions so they were involved in the
[49:58.160 --> 50:02.080]  perjury as well we're all hearing about muller and he's going to indict all these people who
[50:02.080 --> 50:07.120]  supposedly lied with no evidence of lying about you know bimbos and things that's nothing to do with
[50:07.120 --> 50:12.000]  russia and now we have people lying in our face saying you can turn off the location system on
[50:12.000 --> 50:16.000]  your phone yeah you can turn it off you don't get the service but google admits and the fine print
[50:16.000 --> 50:21.840]  they're still tracking you he's telling both face lies to congress and the whole world and it was
[50:21.840 --> 50:26.960]  just outrageous so my message to him was you had me t platformed up your system you only pushed
[50:26.960 --> 50:32.480]  negative lies about me everywhere good guess what every time your executives show up i'm going to
[50:32.480 --> 50:36.960]  not just here but all over the country all over the world i'm launching a major operation against
[50:36.960 --> 50:40.880]  them we're in the third dimension here on the ground we're going to be exposing that they are
[50:40.880 --> 50:46.160]  a clear and present danger they've gone totally evil google is now one of the number one threats
[50:46.160 --> 50:50.480]  to freedom on this planet working with each chinese communist help suppress their population
[50:50.480 --> 50:55.840]  all up on that what what are they doing with chinese dissidents google admits and so does apple
[50:55.840 --> 51:00.880]  that they are giving over all the data with with their phones and systems that are used there
[51:00.880 --> 51:07.600]  to watch their citizens and that the code keys to people's apple and google ids to get on their
[51:07.600 --> 51:14.320]  phones are state controlled to move to china and get tax exemption you have to then give them the
[51:14.320 --> 51:21.360]  codes and the technology transfer and even roiders reports as of what eight months ago that everything
[51:21.360 --> 51:26.960]  has now been given to communist china google and apple have given the keys to the kingdom to all
[51:26.960 --> 51:33.200]  their users data an incredible national security threat to america to the world to the chinese
[51:33.200 --> 51:40.800]  communists google and apple are both like suitors to china wanting to be the system that gets the
[51:40.800 --> 51:46.160]  global social score network set up that will then be adopted on a planetary scale because they
[51:46.160 --> 51:51.200]  believe china will be able to leverage this global social score to be accepted at a planetary level
[51:51.200 --> 51:56.320]  so if apple and google can compete they believe that they will be able to get that contract on
[51:56.320 --> 52:00.560]  basically the mark of the beast world government system and i know that sounds insane that's what
[52:00.560 --> 52:05.520]  it is this is so epic it's just over the top so my message to him is you will not silence humanity
[52:05.520 --> 52:15.200]  and your authoritarianism will be met waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you lie
[52:15.200 --> 52:22.320]  from the front lines of the info war google's world headquarters in china is on fire today
[52:24.320 --> 52:28.320]  much of the building uh this is from about an hour ago much of the building is on fire
[52:28.320 --> 52:36.880]  or that foot is coming up but everybody gets out of there safely a lot of things going on
[52:36.880 --> 52:42.880]  in this world obviously a lot of forces out there don't just the not just the technocrats
[52:46.240 --> 52:51.920]  welcome back ladies and gentlemen now i got into a lot of the economics last segment but then i
[52:51.920 --> 52:58.000]  didn't get to my main point which i tend to do and so i'm going to do that actually when we get
[52:58.000 --> 53:09.440]  into the next hour i'm also going to as i said premiere the hd footage uh that drew and rob do
[53:09.440 --> 53:13.440]  shot with the confrontation with sundar because it's very illustrative they have some other
[53:13.440 --> 53:18.080]  confrontations with uh members of congress that have lied about me personally and they did lie
[53:18.080 --> 53:22.480]  about me by the way in the hearing they had several democrats kept there and say well you have banned
[53:22.480 --> 53:26.960]  the hate speech of alex jones correct uh and of course sundar didn't want to respond to that
[53:26.960 --> 53:30.320]  this is the socialist thing where they just call something hate speech than ban it that's going
[53:30.320 --> 53:34.240]  to be coming up as well we're going to be uploading that to info wars dot com in their future but
[53:35.680 --> 53:40.720]  major governments are now warning and major financial officers are now warning that the
[53:40.720 --> 53:49.680]  carbon taxes that are being set up and that are being deployed are designed to cause economic
[53:49.680 --> 53:57.440]  collapse so we're going to be looking at that as well coming up in the next hour uh michael
[53:57.440 --> 54:04.400]  cohen obviously in the last 30 minutes they announced this he's getting three years for
[54:04.400 --> 54:10.560]  cases involving stormy daniels lying to congress about trump's russia tower and of course there's
[54:10.560 --> 54:13.840]  nothing there with the russia tower there's nothing there with stormy daniels this guy
[54:13.840 --> 54:19.680]  is getting this three years instead of 20 years for 15 million dollars money laundered
[54:19.680 --> 54:24.160]  and a bunch of other stuff so to act like prompt had a crooked toenail he's been given three years
[54:24.160 --> 54:33.520]  he's lucky uh he's getting that what a monstrous little trader what a sack of garbage michael
[54:33.520 --> 54:41.360]  cohen is but we start the next hour i'm going to get into this security firm warns of new global
[54:41.360 --> 54:50.080]  campaign targeting critical infrastructure well that's what the carbon taxes and all this are
[54:50.080 --> 54:56.880]  they're designed to shut down infrastructure and companies and and nations and groups that aren't
[54:56.880 --> 55:03.360]  part of the globalist combine and then of course the really big news the no confidence vote on
[55:03.360 --> 55:08.160]  treason may today on micron tomorrow they're all being driven from office if we don't get them this
[55:08.160 --> 55:12.000]  round we'll get them next round because everything they do is turning to liquid garbage because the
[55:12.000 --> 55:17.920]  public is awake to their treason and the human instinct for survival is kicking back on meanwhile
[55:17.920 --> 55:23.600]  i haven't gotten to this yet and it's unbelievable we knew it you heard about the christmas party
[55:23.600 --> 55:29.200]  getting shot up the outdoor christmas event in germany local government tried to cover it up

[55:36.560 --> 55:42.000]  been arrested 27 times he'll convicted 27 times but the federal government of germany would not

[1:00:25.920 --> 1:00:31.280]  out of control democrat plans for massive taxes on your text messages i'm not kidding and we have
[1:00:31.280 --> 1:00:36.320]  an exclusive video i'm not going to tell you about yet from portland oregon and antifa
[1:00:36.320 --> 1:00:40.880]  with the great clive lewis of ground zero radio got to us it's an exclusive video
[1:00:41.520 --> 1:00:47.120]  it's coming up but first gab mcginnis is going to be in studio tomorrow here in austin with us
[1:00:47.120 --> 1:00:52.480]  the latest of great patriot to be banned he's being banned because he's pro human and he's
[1:00:52.480 --> 1:00:57.760]  promoting strong masculinity people ask why i get so angry why i work so hard and it's the
[1:00:57.760 --> 1:01:07.360]  old classic statement because it's true that's why anybody stands up that is a very exciting
[1:01:07.360 --> 1:01:13.200]  video today isn't it i kind of like that let's stop it right there we're not going to go to
[1:01:13.200 --> 1:01:18.800]  that video now um you got to love these computers it's not the cruise fault they they do that
[1:01:18.800 --> 1:01:24.560]  sometimes a lot going on during the breaks a lot of questions a lot happening a lot moving quickly
[1:01:24.560 --> 1:01:30.320]  and when we do that that's what tends to happen gab mcginnis is going to be in studio
[1:01:31.280 --> 1:01:36.480]  with us tomorrow and we get into why they wanted him banned why they want others banned because
[1:01:36.480 --> 1:01:41.920]  they see men as the threat they see men organizing and and having the instinct to not be usurped
[1:01:41.920 --> 1:01:48.160]  to not be overtaken to not be enslaved that's why when the babilonians or the egyptians or the romans
[1:01:48.160 --> 1:01:56.560]  took over any group they would kill the men down to about age 10 generally they would kill the men
[1:01:56.560 --> 1:02:02.000]  down to about age 10 and then they would put the women in charge of keeping the men in line or
[1:02:02.000 --> 1:02:07.440]  will kill more of your men and then if there were women were having too many male children uh every
[1:02:08.240 --> 1:02:16.720]  occupied group uh from ancient pharaoh uh you're right through to the Aztecs they would then demand
[1:02:16.720 --> 1:02:27.040]  the firstborn child of the male uh and kill it if the firstborn was a male they would kill the male
[1:02:27.040 --> 1:02:31.360]  child you know about that in the old testament it's also in roman histories it's in egyptian
[1:02:31.360 --> 1:02:39.200]  histories it's it's in every culture uh that had a captured group uh you know a a region or area that
[1:02:39.200 --> 1:02:47.280]  that the empire had captured uh they would then have it in a religious ceremony that they were going to kill your
[1:02:47.280 --> 1:02:54.240]  firstborn son and that's because firstborn sons almost all the astronauts are firstborn sons the
[1:02:54.240 --> 1:02:59.760]  icues are higher in firstborn sons genetically they activate in firstborn sons but also in girls
[1:02:59.760 --> 1:03:05.680]  firstborn all statistics show that it's not just that they're babies uh and then see only adults
[1:03:05.680 --> 1:03:12.640]  and kind of project onto that uh firstborns who've even been you know separated out and put with
[1:03:12.640 --> 1:03:17.760]  families with their kids and studies they found some interesting things in leadership qualities
[1:03:17.760 --> 1:03:25.600]  and things like that and so the ancients all knew you know what there's too many of you isrealites
[1:03:25.600 --> 1:03:32.960]  or whatever the group was we're going to demand your firstborn son and we're going to put the
[1:03:32.960 --> 1:03:38.080]  sword to him or we're going to throw him into a fiery pit to uh molok and this is what we're
[1:03:38.080 --> 1:03:46.400]  going to do but but now we do things a little bit different we give our firstborn sons riddling
[1:03:46.400 --> 1:03:52.160]  to shrink their brains retard their growth lower their IQs we give our firstborn sons extra vaccines
[1:03:52.160 --> 1:03:57.840]  and so instead of you know one in 35 000 people having autism it's one in 50 plus and you're about
[1:03:57.840 --> 1:04:01.440]  10 times more likely if you're a boy to have it because your blood brain barrier isn't as strong
[1:04:01.440 --> 1:04:05.280]  and then you've got the targeting of the sons you know to send them off to war that's just a
[1:04:05.280 --> 1:04:09.520]  you know a genetic default and then you've got all the other things and now they're going to teach
[1:04:09.520 --> 1:04:14.240]  your son when they're three years old that you're really a girl and you're going to wear a dress
[1:04:14.240 --> 1:04:19.360]  and by age six this is the new you in compact if you decide you want to be another sex
[1:04:20.880 --> 1:04:24.480]  why we're going to give you hormones even if your parents don't like it and screw you up
[1:04:24.480 --> 1:04:29.200]  and then when you're 10 years old we're going to chop your testicles off and the school's going to
[1:04:29.200 --> 1:04:33.840]  praise you and all the peer pressure because the school is a mind control cult there to make sure
[1:04:33.840 --> 1:04:38.080]  you're destroyed but i guess that's better than getting killed by the sword your heart got out
[1:04:38.080 --> 1:04:44.800]  or thrown to fiery furnace or have an autism and be in a diaper the rest of your life no so you know
[1:04:44.800 --> 1:04:50.640]  it's kind of the humane thing let's not kill their firstborn sons let's just chop their balls off
[1:04:50.640 --> 1:04:55.520]  we'll be right back stay with us info wars.com news wars.com tomorrow's news today

[1:06:32.880 --> 1:06:40.640]  i have several articles that are illustrative of the left just pushing incredibly divisive
[1:06:40.640 --> 1:06:48.880]  racist in their their view homophobic narratives but if it's mica brzezinski or hillary clinton
[1:06:48.880 --> 1:06:53.680]  doing it it's okay but what makes it even worse is
[1:06:57.280 --> 1:07:02.000]  they lie about us when we're not even doing it and get us taking off all these platforms and then
[1:07:02.000 --> 1:07:10.560]  they do it coming up msnbc's mica brzezinski calls mike pumpaya i want to be dictators butt boy
[1:07:12.720 --> 1:07:14.480]  steven cobert said that trump is
[1:07:17.280 --> 1:07:23.600]  vladimir putin's cock holster i'm sorry to use these adult terms we're in we're a very
[1:07:24.160 --> 1:07:27.840]  conservative show this is what's going on on national news this is what's being said about
[1:07:27.840 --> 1:07:33.760]  our president i can't show you the video of the trans brainwashing of kids in public schools in
[1:07:33.760 --> 1:07:39.600]  austin and other events because it's pornographic what two-year-olds what five-year-olds are shown
[1:07:40.640 --> 1:07:47.920]  at school i can't show you what what's shown at public events i can't show you because
[1:07:47.920 --> 1:07:54.560]  we're on broadcast tv and i don't want to show you we did it last year and the station's complaining
[1:07:54.560 --> 1:07:58.880]  and i know why but you know at the end of the day they're showing kids this crap man
[1:08:00.080 --> 1:08:05.680]  men with glitter all over their genitals with little boys and girls hugging them
[1:08:09.440 --> 1:08:14.000]  i mean i like the female form but if i was at the beach a public beach and a woman was going
[1:08:14.000 --> 1:08:18.640]  around with glitter all over like that i'd say hey lady let's put some clothes on this is a man
[1:08:19.520 --> 1:08:23.600]  with glitter on his genitals with little kids hugging him and it's it's on the news is a good
[1:08:23.600 --> 1:08:30.160]  thing i'm sorry i'm digressing remember hillary said black people all look alike
[1:08:32.560 --> 1:08:39.280]  hold them super predators too they had to be brought to heal like a dog imagine if
[1:08:39.280 --> 1:08:43.760]  trump ever said something like that his career'd be over and it should be but you know what you
[1:08:43.760 --> 1:08:47.920]  got hillary saying it's like it's all right she's hillary and bill clinton's black
[1:08:47.920 --> 1:08:58.560]  and now mike Pompeo patriot topless class great guy doing great work for this country
[1:08:58.560 --> 1:09:08.480]  is a butt boy a butt boy is pretty much quasi pedophilic too it means you know a boy that a
[1:09:08.480 --> 1:09:14.560]  man uses his butt they have to define this for you but that's what a butt boy is in fact it goes back
[1:09:14.560 --> 1:09:20.160]  to they used to impress down to age six seven eight years old usually about ten was the age
[1:09:20.160 --> 1:09:25.600]  they wanted on to british ships impressmen part of a revolutionary war was over impressmen they
[1:09:25.600 --> 1:09:30.960]  would just kidnap your child sometimes a hundred miles in you know inland and knock them over the
[1:09:30.960 --> 1:09:36.480]  head and just take them and put them on a ship to be the cabin boy well let me tell you on some ships
[1:09:36.480 --> 1:09:43.360]  you know the cabin boy was getting buggered and buggered is the english term for screwing kids
[1:09:43.360 --> 1:09:47.440]  and buggerings big deal over in england as we all know you see it all the news with the establishment
[1:09:48.880 --> 1:09:51.920]  but now they just bugger your children's brains right out in the open
[1:09:52.640 --> 1:09:57.520]  and turn them into little perverts when they're age five and if mommy and daddy don't like it we
[1:09:57.520 --> 1:10:06.640]  don't take your child from you if you live in a blue city by the way i my mom's from austin
[1:10:06.640 --> 1:10:13.920]  i grew up in dallas but my family helped found this state and i've had family living here in
[1:10:13.920 --> 1:10:22.640]  waterloo as it was named before it was austin for 180 years and i've got our building and our
[1:10:22.640 --> 1:10:28.880]  structure built here but i it's it my in the next few years i think i'm we're gonna evacuate austin
[1:10:28.880 --> 1:10:34.560]  it just it's it's falling to california and at least move a distance from it because it's too
[1:10:34.560 --> 1:10:39.120]  dangerous being these courts here it's too dangerous to have children here i mean i'm it's it's it's
[1:10:39.120 --> 1:10:45.200]  san francisco now austin has fallen it's very sad you saw the whole state's almost falling to
[1:10:45.200 --> 1:10:51.360]  pedo aurora and the rest of them i'm sorry beta aurora beta aurora wherever the hell at bevo
[1:10:51.360 --> 1:10:59.040]  bevo aurora so that's all coming up and all these internal google documents that have come out
[1:10:59.040 --> 1:11:05.760]  we're gonna be covering all of it google executives openly said in an open forum
[1:11:06.880 --> 1:11:11.040]  that's what they have is these big ampla theater university style deals with executives get up and
[1:11:11.040 --> 1:11:17.440]  then it transmits to all the google campuses and they say things like fq leakers and then it goes
[1:11:17.440 --> 1:11:23.120]  into how they're gonna stop the leaks the number one threats the leaks because if you want to know
[1:11:23.120 --> 1:11:31.440]  what google really is it's not just a i it's not just a weapon but when we start the next segment
[1:11:31.440 --> 1:11:36.800]  remind me crew because i'm going to play this special clip then of what google really is
[1:11:40.560 --> 1:11:49.680]  google is the coward's weapon you know you see these science fiction movies with this big giant
[1:11:49.680 --> 1:11:56.240]  robot 50 feet tall destroying everything throwing army tanks around when they finally defeat it
[1:11:56.240 --> 1:12:05.280]  there's like a little half foot tall warm and driving it and that's what google is
[1:12:06.640 --> 1:12:13.600]  is it's the ultimate coward's secret weapon and i'm going to tell you what google really is on
[1:12:13.600 --> 1:12:18.080]  the other side of this break you're going to get the world exclusive why they fear info war is more
[1:12:18.080 --> 1:12:24.800]  than anything else because i've read their own writings their own statements their own dreams
[1:12:25.920 --> 1:12:29.680]  and i've studied their overall operations and the globals to control them and i know them
[1:12:30.480 --> 1:12:36.880]  and i know what they've named their secret projects like palantir
[1:12:38.640 --> 1:12:44.160]  and i know what their end game is and the fact that sundar walked in there with that crap eating
[1:12:44.160 --> 1:12:53.840]  grin and lied to congress just shows you how arrogant he is but he wasn't by the end he looks
[1:12:53.840 --> 1:13:00.080]  scared people say you know sundar's dangerous he's got all this stuff he could you know think i don't
[1:13:00.080 --> 1:13:07.280]  know that what's dangerous is rolling over to that sack of garbage the reason he fought like the
[1:13:07.280 --> 1:13:13.440]  devil to get here so he could have freedom to do what he wanted shows how evil he is and the most
[1:13:13.440 --> 1:13:18.800]  powerful statement was by louis gomer congressman of texas
[1:13:21.040 --> 1:13:24.080]  and he said only america would allow you to create something like this
[1:13:27.440 --> 1:13:32.240]  and he said my god used to you live in the dark so much you don't even know what the light is sundar
[1:13:32.240 --> 1:13:43.600]  and that's a very profound statement sundar you don't even know what the light is
[1:13:46.160 --> 1:13:53.200]  and that's really it the people that are into evil they don't know what light is they don't even see it
[1:13:53.200 --> 1:14:05.040]  he'd claw his way to get here and then he'd set up a globalist caste system over us
[1:14:07.760 --> 1:14:12.000]  but he's just the front man for far more evil people sundar is the front man
[1:14:14.320 --> 1:14:21.280]  sundar and his fabulous sunsword as he cuts through liberty with his knife of censorship
[1:14:21.280 --> 1:14:24.960]  we're going to go to break and i'm going to come back give you the big secret of google
[1:14:27.040 --> 1:14:30.640]  and we really are giving you a big secret there's a lot of talk out there there's a lot of people
[1:14:30.640 --> 1:14:35.280]  that claim they know how stuff works or people that claim oh yeah this or that we know of what we
[1:14:35.280 --> 1:14:42.800]  speak and that's why we're hated and that's why it's up to you and only you to spread this
[1:14:42.800 --> 1:14:47.360]  information if you accept this mission the wonderful listeners of this broadcast people from india
[1:14:47.360 --> 1:14:51.520]  people from china people from mexico people from russia people from all over the world
[1:14:51.520 --> 1:14:55.360]  people from africa if you love liberty and you love justice and god i love you

[1:19:00.080 --> 1:19:04.720]  escalating our sales to clear out inventory of many of our best selling items and then i came
[1:19:04.720 --> 1:19:09.040]  up with the idea last week let's not just extend the sale of free shipping store wide 50 to 75
[1:19:09.040 --> 1:19:16.880]  percent off double patriot points let's extend that sale but also add a free gift with every order

[1:19:21.600 --> 1:19:27.440]  free gift of a best selling t-shirt while supplies last and what i mean by that is everyone will get
[1:19:27.440 --> 1:19:32.560]  a t-shirt but these are going to be selling out so whatever you order that day they'll be the shirt
[1:19:32.560 --> 1:19:36.560]  of the day that's there until it sells out and then there'll be another shirt that goes up for

[1:19:41.840 --> 1:19:47.360]  ever had so this is a loss leader we are losing money on this this is our biggest sale ever get
[1:19:47.360 --> 1:19:51.760]  your free gift your free shipping everything and don't fight the crowds info wars store dot com
[1:19:51.760 --> 1:19:56.720]  info wars life dot com or triple eight two five three three one three nine god bless you and thank
[1:19:56.720 --> 1:20:12.640]  you for your support you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:20:12.640 --> 1:20:29.440]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[1:20:31.040 --> 1:20:39.200]  live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones there's always a blind spot in
[1:20:39.200 --> 1:20:43.920]  tyrants throughout history where they become haughty they believe they're invincible
[1:20:46.320 --> 1:20:47.920]  we see that with the big tech giants
[1:20:50.560 --> 1:20:54.720]  our problem is not going to be these different arrogant tech leaders it's going to be
[1:20:56.400 --> 1:21:00.160]  the system they're building and the dependency that the average person's going to have on it
[1:21:00.160 --> 1:21:06.480]  now these things kill competition and actually stagnate society and vertically integrate power
[1:21:06.480 --> 1:21:12.480]  or some of the most corrupt out of control groups so if you want to understand google you have to
[1:21:12.480 --> 1:21:19.360]  understand silent weapons for quiet wars now that's just a paper that a special operations
[1:21:20.560 --> 1:21:28.320]  black ops commander wrote back in the eighties but if you know about killing people softly
[1:21:28.320 --> 1:21:35.360]  that's a term much older you want to kill somebody and not have them know how you killed them
[1:21:35.360 --> 1:21:39.760]  or why you killed them because you don't want to get the repercussion of them fighting back
[1:21:41.520 --> 1:21:46.960]  that's why women you know tend to poison people they don't tend to beat people's brains out like
[1:21:46.960 --> 1:21:52.640]  men do because they're not physically historically as strong as a man so they do it by stealth
[1:21:55.520 --> 1:22:02.640]  and so if you look at google its power is that you don't know it's spying on you in fact you
[1:22:02.640 --> 1:22:07.440]  opt in and never think about the fact that it's watching you you're getting this limited query
[1:22:07.440 --> 1:22:11.520]  but it's now tracking what you want where you're going and then down the road it can put all that
[1:22:11.520 --> 1:22:15.280]  together and guess what you're going to do next with algorithms that are basically completely
[1:22:15.280 --> 1:22:21.440]  accurate then they can program those algorithms to manipulate search results to control what you're
[1:22:21.440 --> 1:22:29.840]  going to do down to an exact science so it's not just predicting the future it's directing the future
[1:22:29.840 --> 1:22:35.200]  and i told you this 20 years ago now it's main three minutes but what's the rest of the story
[1:22:37.840 --> 1:22:41.360]  well there's not just the trojan horse application
[1:22:44.320 --> 1:22:48.880]  there's not just the gaming the finances the politics or that's all side issues
[1:22:52.000 --> 1:22:57.040]  the globalists at the universities that develop the idea for the intergalactic
[1:22:57.040 --> 1:23:01.760]  communication system that's what the worldwide web was first called and then the british scientists
[1:23:01.760 --> 1:23:05.680]  the us side has actually developed the plan and the different interfacing those the computers
[1:23:05.680 --> 1:23:09.520]  and have humans interface with those and then it was supposed to be a system so they couldn't cut
[1:23:09.520 --> 1:23:14.640]  out communications worldwide even a nuclear war that's kind of the public reason for the internet
[1:23:15.520 --> 1:23:20.720]  but it was really deployed as this digital neural net human interface
[1:23:20.720 --> 1:23:28.960]  but under its current configuration the very universities created their sjw
[1:23:29.680 --> 1:23:34.640]  anti-free speech hives told them you're the new ruling class you're going to take over the planet
[1:23:34.640 --> 1:23:42.400]  take over the country take over the world and so they could then take those people out of
[1:23:42.400 --> 1:23:48.000]  western universities and put them in to these controlled cults in san francisco and a few
[1:23:48.000 --> 1:23:53.200]  other areas where they can watch them drug them carry out mind control experiments on them i mean
[1:23:53.200 --> 1:23:58.560]  that they do it all silicon valley is unbelievable and all people that go to the parties and are
[1:23:58.560 --> 1:24:03.600]  involved i've been invited two years ago didn't obviously didn't get involved uh but i mean it's
[1:24:03.600 --> 1:24:08.960]  it's a full-on cult because again it's all mind control they're watching you they're tracking you
[1:24:10.560 --> 1:24:13.440]  and so it's the system where these incredible cowards
[1:24:13.440 --> 1:24:23.600]  can watch what you do know your dreams go out and put out false information in government
[1:24:23.600 --> 1:24:29.280]  and corporate databases aren't even public uh sell that data manipulate that data while sitting
[1:24:29.280 --> 1:24:38.080]  up there acting all non-threatening and having nerdy guys with long hair and pink socks and
[1:24:38.080 --> 1:24:46.640]  this is all very sophisticated training it's all a complete cover
[1:24:47.200 --> 1:24:52.400]  and and so that's why they even promote in these corporations men that act effeminate men that
[1:24:52.400 --> 1:24:58.880]  act non-threatening men saying oh i don't have any power oh i don't apple isn't powerful oh
[1:24:58.880 --> 1:25:10.240]  google's not powerful oh alex jones we don't know anything about him and you saw us with
[1:25:10.240 --> 1:25:15.760]  tim cook at interviews about me he's like oh i don't have power oh i don't do anything oh i
[1:25:15.760 --> 1:25:25.600]  don't i'm helping i'm weak and it's the ultimate coward powered tool where basically it's this
[1:25:25.600 --> 1:25:34.480]  giant global armored weaponized spy grid exoskeleton that these people get to step into
[1:25:34.480 --> 1:25:39.040]  and whoever's the most cutting the most manipulative the most deceptive gets promoted up through the
[1:25:39.040 --> 1:25:45.600]  ranks and so they've just got millions of sjw's you've seen the project veritas videos you've seen
[1:25:45.600 --> 1:25:49.360]  the undercover footage you've seen the documents and wiki leaks all the new stuff coming out from
[1:25:49.360 --> 1:25:56.160]  rightbart about info wars and tucker carlson and brightbart being targeted to be shut down
[1:25:57.040 --> 1:26:06.160]  this is an weaponized cult a power cult with people with chips on their shoulders
[1:26:06.800 --> 1:26:12.880]  who depending on their psychological profile are putting different cast systems in the grid
[1:26:12.880 --> 1:26:21.200]  and then they get to step into this cult where they're highly surveilled where they go through
[1:26:21.200 --> 1:26:26.880]  rituals that are very embarrassing where they do compromising things and then once you're in that
[1:26:26.880 --> 1:26:31.360]  cult this is the new mafia once you're in this new intelligence agency this corporate private
[1:26:31.360 --> 1:26:37.040]  intelligence agency you graduate into the eugenics population reduction final level
[1:26:37.040 --> 1:26:46.320]  and there's only maybe a thousand people in that club and i was offered to join that club
[1:26:47.120 --> 1:26:51.200]  because i'd already reversed engineered it and and so i was offered to join that club
[1:26:52.000 --> 1:26:58.560]  by the kissinger group by other groups because the mere fact that i had reversed engineered it all
[1:26:58.560 --> 1:27:03.200]  meant well i should obviously be in that club they didn't even tell me anything because i already knew
[1:27:03.200 --> 1:27:10.480]  about the club already understood the club so it's a whole cast system of weak evil traders
[1:27:10.480 --> 1:27:15.280]  who are put in low level positions and then it goes from there up with all these scumbags
[1:27:16.160 --> 1:27:21.040]  who basically have created a system to wage war against the general public to met all sorts of
[1:27:21.040 --> 1:27:27.280]  crimes who terrible things but then poses sjw liberals who are guardians of the planet we'll
[1:27:27.280 --> 1:27:34.000]  go to break stay with us in terms of power i've never felt like a hending power
[1:27:42.720 --> 1:27:48.800]  in apple we believe that technology needs to have a clear point of view on this challenge
[1:27:48.800 --> 1:27:56.800]  that's why we should only have one message you have no place on our platform
[1:27:59.440 --> 1:28:07.600]  we have no time here in apple we are not afraid to say that our value drives our duration

[1:33:51.280 --> 1:33:58.080]  the thinking equation and to pre-program the population according to the aims and dreams and
[1:33:58.080 --> 1:34:06.160]  objectives of the ruling technotronic technocracy elite or technocrats but how it really operates
[1:34:06.160 --> 1:34:12.720]  and what gives it its power is creating the chip on the soldier sjw's who believe in
[1:34:12.720 --> 1:34:19.520]  anti-free speech and oppression being prepared in the universities and then shipped in to the
[1:34:19.520 --> 1:34:25.600]  technocracy to then command and control the whole system so the entire program is a giant
[1:34:25.600 --> 1:34:30.720]  coward operation it's a system where you don't know you're being attacked a system where you
[1:34:30.720 --> 1:34:35.120]  don't know you're being surveilled a system where you don't know you're being ensnared until
[1:34:35.120 --> 1:34:40.880]  suddenly they announce the global social score and if you don't do exactly what these people say
[1:34:41.440 --> 1:34:49.040]  some shadowy person will ban you for life not just from facebook or google or twitter
[1:34:49.040 --> 1:34:54.480]  but from being able to have a bank card or a job or travel oh but you say well i'll just
[1:34:55.200 --> 1:35:01.280]  use cash oh sorry china has a goal within five years so does sweden to be totally
[1:35:02.400 --> 1:35:07.680]  non-cash in fact you already get a social score downgrade in china if you use cash
[1:35:10.320 --> 1:35:15.200]  and now you see where this is going people say i have nothing to hide i've done nothing wrong so
[1:35:15.200 --> 1:35:20.880]  what if they're watching me what do they have to hide you know it was a big phenomenon in the last
[1:35:20.880 --> 1:35:25.440]  10 years people on facebook and other places would say we're going to cancun or we're going to europe
[1:35:25.440 --> 1:35:30.480]  we just had our christmas look i got this big beautiful louis Vuitton bag and i got this new
[1:35:30.480 --> 1:35:37.120]  computer they'd leave their geo location on thieves would figure out from their facebook where they
[1:35:37.120 --> 1:35:41.440]  lived and that they were going to be gone for two weeks and they'd come rob them millions of
[1:35:41.440 --> 1:35:48.240]  burglaries based on that people finally figured to stop doing that to turn their geo location off
[1:35:48.240 --> 1:35:53.440]  on their photos let's see it's not just run of the mill street though you gotta worry about
[1:35:53.440 --> 1:35:57.520]  like why do you have doors on your house why do you have
[1:36:00.160 --> 1:36:06.640]  windows you're not a bad person but there's something about you're about to get in bed with
[1:36:06.640 --> 1:36:12.960]  your wife to watch television maybe do something else and you close the blinds there's just
[1:36:12.960 --> 1:36:20.800]  something about closing the hot door it's private it's your time it's the essence of freedom it's
[1:36:20.800 --> 1:36:32.720]  privacy your medical records your sexual preferences who you are what you've experimented with all of
[1:36:32.720 --> 1:36:38.320]  that is under the control of these technocracy people picked from the world ready to work with
[1:36:38.320 --> 1:36:43.520]  every authoritarian regime proven their control freaks proven they love to censor people proven
[1:36:43.520 --> 1:36:52.400]  they love to lie to get people censored and then now we're just going to turn our lives over to
[1:36:52.400 --> 1:37:00.640]  these shadowy people and let them know everything about us my wife is not a spying type person she's
[1:37:00.640 --> 1:37:05.920]  not a person that's you know got a chip on her shoulder but before i've been looking for a pin
[1:37:05.920 --> 1:37:09.680]  or a piece of gum or something and i've been in her purse and she's like what are you doing on my
[1:37:09.680 --> 1:37:14.720]  purse i'm like oh i'm just looking for something figured you might have a you know something i'm
[1:37:14.720 --> 1:37:20.320]  needing here because there's that sense of territorialism identity
[1:37:22.800 --> 1:37:26.640]  sometimes my phone's dead and i grab hers or do something she's like what are you doing on my phone
[1:37:26.640 --> 1:37:31.840]  now imagine though everybody else is in your phone they're in your purse they're in your brain
[1:37:31.840 --> 1:37:36.640]  and if you talk about it oh you're the conspiracy guy now it's all admitted to have been true and
[1:37:36.640 --> 1:37:41.360]  is worse and i'm even more of a bad guy see how that works
[1:37:45.600 --> 1:37:53.120]  so google is a system for very wicked bad control freaks to commit massive crimes
[1:37:53.120 --> 1:37:57.360]  and to play god and to be bigger than the government the police the military everything
[1:37:57.360 --> 1:38:03.280]  and to try to get away with it it is bottom line satanic and only bad will come of it
[1:38:04.000 --> 1:38:08.400]  and that's their plan that's why they were said their their their their their their slogan was
[1:38:08.400 --> 1:38:17.600]  don't be evil because they are inherently pure evil now i've got all this other news but i was
[1:38:17.600 --> 1:38:21.600]  putting most of the show on google today because it's such a big deal and those hearings and i
[1:38:21.600 --> 1:38:28.800]  haven't even played the hd of my confrontation with sundar the ceo of google but make no mistake
[1:38:29.760 --> 1:38:34.960]  obama and hillary and the democrats and the leftist cia they still control google it was
[1:38:34.960 --> 1:38:39.040]  built by the u.s government it's been totally hijacked by rogue unelected groups
[1:38:41.120 --> 1:38:45.760]  and they are involved in such crimes against this nation it's truly unspeakable
[1:38:45.760 --> 1:38:52.480]  and i think it's emblematic of how corrupt they are that their main headquarters in china burst
[1:38:52.480 --> 1:39:00.080]  into flames today i wish no harm against anybody but it is a omen i think for the fact that the
[1:39:00.080 --> 1:39:11.520]  world is awake to this and upset and that we're not in kansas anymore now there's a bunch of breaking
[1:39:11.520 --> 1:39:16.960]  news i haven't gotten to yet i i want to get to what the left would call homophobic statements by
[1:39:16.960 --> 1:39:21.360]  minkin brzezinski the daughter of a famous mass murderer uh zebicki brzezinski that's all coming
[1:39:21.360 --> 1:39:25.600]  up next segment and i will finally get to that premiere that hd video that i heard her hurryed
[1:39:25.600 --> 1:39:29.600]  them up to get up this morning but i haven't played yet of our sundar confrontation that's
[1:39:29.600 --> 1:39:32.880]  next segment but i'm going to go ahead and just stop right now and i'm going to spend a couple
[1:39:32.880 --> 1:39:37.680]  minutes plugging because if we don't do this we won't be here but more importantly than that

[1:40:36.880 --> 1:40:42.640]  and again that's my rationale for losing money and doing this they're the biggest overarching
[1:40:42.640 --> 1:40:46.880]  reason as you've seen all of the news paypal dropped us other payment processors they try to

[1:47:26.080 --> 1:47:33.120]  the globalist system all across the world is being challenged they thought they were invincible
[1:47:33.120 --> 1:47:38.960]  three some a faces the removal from office a crown faces it tomorrow for their treason
[1:47:40.000 --> 1:47:43.920]  meanwhile i've talked about this here's the hd video and audio for radio and tv
[1:47:43.920 --> 1:47:52.560]  listeners and viewers of yesterday when you've got sundar the ceo of google who's doing all this
[1:47:52.560 --> 1:47:58.000]  illegal stuff on record he went in line to congress i predicted he would go in a lot of congress
[1:48:00.240 --> 1:48:05.280]  and when he walks in none of the media we're talking probably 50 tv cameras tries to go over
[1:48:05.280 --> 1:48:12.320]  and talk to him when he left no one tried to talk to him except our reports
[1:48:14.640 --> 1:48:20.480]  so here's this guy that poses this bastion of liberalism he's going to ban all conservatives
[1:48:20.480 --> 1:48:24.800]  because we're all nazis his own internal document show he's doing this
[1:48:26.800 --> 1:48:30.640]  he's lying to congress about it and then we're not supposed to confront him
[1:48:33.440 --> 1:48:38.400]  about this so he was laughing at first when i was talking about google is on record helping china
[1:48:38.400 --> 1:48:43.760]  round up its dissidents and competing to help censor their whole population with not just dragonfly
[1:48:43.760 --> 1:48:47.680]  but other platforms and then here he is making jokes about it but by the end he wasn't laughing
[1:48:47.680 --> 1:48:53.200]  here it is google executives and facebook executives and twitter executives go before congress
[1:48:54.240 --> 1:49:00.160]  and they tell congress that they're not censoring anybody even though we have all the google documents
[1:49:00.160 --> 1:49:05.040]  we have internal google videos we have internal twitter videos where their executives talk about
[1:49:05.040 --> 1:49:10.000]  how they're censoring everyone i think i think god's uh here he is right here let's go over here
[1:49:10.000 --> 1:49:20.160]  sundar you know google is helping china with dragonfly and you know that they're helping censor
[1:49:20.160 --> 1:49:23.680]  and you know you know that you've sold this country out and you won't even help the pentagon
[1:49:23.680 --> 1:49:29.280]  you'll help the chicoms you bet on the wrong country sundar there he goes ladies and gentlemen
[1:49:30.800 --> 1:49:34.720]  that guy has had his people tell congress they're not censoring either lie to congress
[1:49:34.720 --> 1:49:40.880]  they can be arrested just like that chinese spy arrested in canada two weeks ago we've allowed
[1:49:40.880 --> 1:49:44.400]  this globalist into this country to sell it out some believe it
[1:49:57.920 --> 1:50:02.560]  sundar we know you're not an american but you can't work with the communist chinese
[1:50:02.560 --> 1:50:06.640]  you can't work with the communist chinese sundar you can't work with the communist chinese on
[1:50:06.640 --> 1:50:12.000]  dragonfly censoring and rounding up their dissidents sundar is arresting dissidents in china
[1:50:12.560 --> 1:50:18.400]  apple's working with china to suppress their people sundar you're engaged in treason you've
[1:50:18.400 --> 1:50:23.200]  had google executives lie to congress you're not censoring conservatives sundar you will not silence

[1:51:25.800 --> 1:51:51.520]  evil to show Sundar I'm not saying that just control yourself okay get out of
[1:51:51.520 --> 1:51:55.680]  control now I'm under control thank you I just was he's taken my free speech away
[1:51:55.680 --> 1:51:58.960]  and lied about me so I need to stand up to him I'm not worried about that right
[1:51:58.960 --> 1:52:03.280]  now they're gonna talk about me in this committee I will be talked about so
[1:52:03.280 --> 1:52:07.200]  what am I supposed to do I don't get a day in court they lie about me Google
[1:52:07.200 --> 1:52:11.320]  only puts lies out all the top searches or lies about me and my family and that
[1:52:11.320 --> 1:52:14.080]  guy helps round up political dissidents and then his people come to lie to
[1:52:14.080 --> 1:52:19.000]  Congress over and over and over again and we don't get to respond to them so
[1:52:19.000 --> 1:52:23.160]  Google is helping build censorship systems in China for a global social
[1:52:23.160 --> 1:52:26.960]  score they've tested there to totally control every aspect of our lives
[1:52:26.960 --> 1:52:31.520]  Apple and Tim Cook has said he wants censorship worldwide they're working with
[1:52:31.520 --> 1:52:35.520]  the Communist Chinese that have killed five times
[1:52:35.520 --> 1:53:00.680]  and we're here simply trying to tell the truth and stand up for what's right and
[1:53:00.680 --> 1:53:04.080]  let these people know that we will not be silenced and that Americans who are
[1:53:04.080 --> 1:53:06.640]  being censored on the internet libertarians Christians conservatives
[1:53:06.640 --> 1:53:11.280]  are gonna come to Congress we're gonna come to the state houses we're gonna go
[1:53:11.280 --> 1:53:15.240]  to all the public events and we're gonna let people like Sundar who literally
[1:53:15.240 --> 1:53:18.680]  helps China round up their people and it's put a censorship system in there
[1:53:18.680 --> 1:53:22.720]  and here we're gonna let them know that they're not gonna sit there and
[1:53:22.720 --> 1:53:25.720]  silence us and then we're gonna speak out and we're going to expose what
[1:53:25.720 --> 1:53:29.840]  they're doing this is a authoritarianism that has come to this country and Sundar
[1:53:29.840 --> 1:53:36.080]  and Google are the absolutely most evil corporation on earth their camouflage
[1:53:36.080 --> 1:53:41.520]  was saying don't be evil but they got rid of that slogan didn't I imagine if it
[1:53:41.520 --> 1:53:45.720]  was say 1880 and you live in New York City and electricity has just been
[1:53:45.720 --> 1:53:52.120]  discovered just been invented the use of it and they try to pass a law that only
[1:53:52.120 --> 1:53:57.720]  certain people in the future can have electricity a utility that would be very
[1:53:57.720 --> 1:54:01.600]  draconian that would create two different civilizations one above one above
[1:54:01.600 --> 1:54:07.640]  below but this technology sneaks up on us the leftists get control of it the
[1:54:07.640 --> 1:54:13.200]  globalist control of it and now they want to censor and control everybody and
[1:54:13.200 --> 1:54:17.360]  they think we're ignorant they think we're stupid if we don't get involved
[1:54:17.360 --> 1:54:23.520]  and demand access to all this we're done I mean if they can cut us out of the AI
[1:54:23.520 --> 1:54:27.680]  system they've built that is meant to be a monopoly well if you're not in
[1:54:27.680 --> 1:54:31.400]  the monopoly you're starving to death and they're saying yeah if you don't
[1:54:31.400 --> 1:54:35.720]  follow what we say we've got a new global social score you will starve to
[1:54:35.720 --> 1:54:43.600]  death you got it so you think I want to go confront Sundar you can want to go
[1:54:43.600 --> 1:54:50.600]  confront these people no but we have stacks of news this week with new emails
[1:54:50.600 --> 1:55:01.200]  released by Google employees high-level where they say bright Bart Alex Jones
[1:55:01.200 --> 1:55:05.520]  info wars we're in all these we've got a target all their sponsors and kicked
[1:55:05.520 --> 1:55:10.280]  them off the internet go into everything they've ever said or done and find
[1:55:10.280 --> 1:55:13.400]  something and what just happened to Gavin McGinnis is gonna be a studio
[1:55:13.400 --> 1:55:20.680]  tomorrow he's landing about an hour two hours he is the guy that launched Vice
[1:55:20.680 --> 1:55:27.560]  TV he's the guy that launched the whole trendy beard movement he didn't do it on
[1:55:27.560 --> 1:55:31.640]  purpose but that he's the guy they got his face on like you know beard cream at
[1:55:31.640 --> 1:55:37.720]  the mall they're scared of him he's launched trends he's just a pro human
[1:55:37.720 --> 1:55:43.280]  guy classical liberal they went and banned his YouTube channel with millions
[1:55:43.280 --> 1:55:49.680]  of subscribers millions of views because they said he violated Vans copyright
[1:55:49.680 --> 1:55:57.320]  for a Vans commercial that he was in he went into his records 10 years ago when
[1:55:57.320 --> 1:56:02.960]  he first heard his YouTube he went Vans paid me to do that ad that was paid
[1:56:02.960 --> 1:56:07.960]  programming he called Vans they said we did not file a complaint on you this is
[1:56:07.960 --> 1:56:13.960]  made up he got the head of Vans and their lawyer to call Google and they said we
[1:56:13.960 --> 1:56:20.200]  don't care you're gone it turns out George Soros and Media Matters did a
[1:56:20.200 --> 1:56:29.920]  scan found that and then put in the fake complaint saying it was Vans choose now
[1:56:29.920 --> 1:56:35.200]  once Vans said they would sue and I'm giving you inside baseball now so now
[1:56:35.200 --> 1:56:38.800]  they reinstated his YouTube channel but I warned Gavin this morning before he
[1:56:38.800 --> 1:56:42.720]  took off I said I've been through this man they said I said nobody died at
[1:56:42.720 --> 1:56:46.640]  Parkland when all I said was the police stood down they had to restore the
[1:56:46.640 --> 1:56:50.480]  channel then but they're gonna find something you it's just so horrible to

[2:01:06.680 --> 2:01:15.320]  up I have a guest joining us he's the gentleman that got demonized when at a
[2:01:15.320 --> 2:01:19.240]  university hearing how white people are inherently like cancer and the worst
[2:01:19.240 --> 2:01:22.800]  people on the planet he just said you know the whole modern world which is
[2:01:22.800 --> 2:01:26.760]  true the Renaissance and the printing press and the combustion engine and
[2:01:26.760 --> 2:01:32.720]  space travel and just basically the internet was a Western European creation
[2:01:32.720 --> 2:01:36.040]  and I mean you know we can't help it we're kind of like Martians with these
[2:01:36.040 --> 2:01:44.760]  big heads and your planet will serve us well but the point is is that is that we
[2:01:44.760 --> 2:01:48.520]  have the Christian ethos which really made us successful and tamed our
[2:01:48.520 --> 2:01:54.640]  barbarian problems that we had that kept us in the caves so Christianity plus
[2:01:54.640 --> 2:01:58.560]  Western civilization created civilization so he got a lot of trouble for
[2:01:58.560 --> 2:02:03.000]  that he's going to be joining us coming up and I have another compilation of
[2:02:03.000 --> 2:02:08.120]  confronting congressman Swallows well Swallows tyranny well he's a world
[2:02:08.120 --> 2:02:16.480]  renowned sword swallower and we also have congressman islands float coming
[2:02:16.480 --> 2:02:21.480]  up and Congressman Deutsch who famously told incredible lies in the
[2:02:21.480 --> 2:02:28.200]  district committee about me six months ago so you did four wars banned off of
[2:02:28.200 --> 2:02:35.040]  many of these platforms so that is all coming up but the first thing that I
[2:02:35.040 --> 2:02:37.640]  want to hit when we come back I'm gonna be a good boy and get to this I
[2:02:37.640 --> 2:02:44.200]  mentioned an hour ago is MSNBC's Mika Brzezinski and I wouldn't blame if
[2:02:44.200 --> 2:02:48.920]  Hitler had a son or daughter I wouldn't blame them for their father but if they
[2:02:48.920 --> 2:02:54.320]  follow their footsteps and I do blame them Mika Brzezinski what a hateful
[2:02:54.320 --> 2:02:59.840]  evil tart everyone I know that knows her and I know quite a few say she is the
[2:02:59.840 --> 2:03:06.360]  most hateful vapid conceited empty vicious person no one gets a tip
[2:03:06.360 --> 2:03:10.800]  everyone gets bitched out everyone gets told how they're a piece of crap I mean
[2:03:10.800 --> 2:03:14.720]  you know she's got a bear trap reportedly between her legs so you know
[2:03:14.720 --> 2:03:18.280]  it's it's it's like an alien we're defibrillating the guy's chest and the
[2:03:18.280 --> 2:03:22.480]  chest must open and the big teeth bite the arms off that's like your poorly
[2:03:22.480 --> 2:03:27.840]  I was like you know down there that's what happened to that's what happened to
[2:03:27.840 --> 2:03:33.080]  Joe Scarborough and he wasn't you know found with dead interns their heads
[2:03:33.080 --> 2:03:38.120]  bashed in it was just like it's sat down I'm like well I'm not actually sat
[2:03:38.120 --> 2:03:41.800]  down well it is sat down but it's not sat down with a dead intern and well the
[2:03:41.800 --> 2:03:49.240]  whole metal trap thing can we pull up the thing 1983 or whatever incredible I
[2:03:49.240 --> 2:03:53.320]  think for the best film John Carpenter put out where you defibrillating the guy
[2:03:53.320 --> 2:03:56.960]  and the chest opens up and the monsters teeth bite the arms off and the guy goes
[2:03:56.960 --> 2:04:00.640]  like this let's bring because that's reportedly what it's like to crawl into
[2:04:00.640 --> 2:04:09.200]  bed with Mika Brzezinski I'm sorry she's out making comments here see I'm a bad
[2:04:09.200 --> 2:04:13.880]  guy for making that comment but she's fine if I say her vagina's like a bear
[2:04:13.880 --> 2:04:19.120]  trap I'm a bad person even though it's a joke but if she says want to be
[2:04:19.120 --> 2:04:25.200]  dictators but boy when her father bragged that he helped kill millions around
[2:04:25.200 --> 2:04:29.840]  the world and was an absolute criminal it just adds a delicious cherry on top

[2:06:12.760 --> 2:06:25.240]  lines I just I have to ask because I don't think that I can't think of
[2:06:25.240 --> 2:06:29.680]  anyone here who could put it more clearly than you I understand that Donald
[2:06:29.680 --> 2:06:33.760]  Trump doesn't care hylman makes a good point he doesn't care but why doesn't
[2:06:33.760 --> 2:06:38.920]  Mike Pompeo care right now are the pathetic deflections that we just heard
[2:06:38.920 --> 2:06:44.960]  when he appeared on fox and friends is that a patriot speaking or a wannabe
[2:06:44.960 --> 2:06:50.040]  dictators but boy dead serious I'm asking are these the words of a
[2:06:50.040 --> 2:06:55.240]  patriot he's debased himself he once again is undercut the conclusions of our
[2:06:55.240 --> 2:07:13.400]  intel community
[2:07:13.400 --> 2:07:18.040]  if you wonder what's driving down the stock market it's the Democrats the
[2:07:18.040 --> 2:07:21.880]  private Federal Reserve that's European owned saying the president's criminally
[2:07:21.880 --> 2:07:27.880]  going to jail he's but boy which means that a young young man underage that an
[2:07:27.880 --> 2:07:31.960]  older man has sex with that's what they need vernacular of that if you look up
[2:07:31.960 --> 2:07:41.320]  the providence of but boy that's what it means so hearing pedophilic stuff out
[2:07:41.320 --> 2:07:49.120]  of the bindi brzezinski's evil dropping mica I mean what do you think falls off
[2:07:49.120 --> 2:07:53.760]  the hind end of that guy well make a brzezinski literally was crapped out on
[2:07:53.760 --> 2:07:58.720]  the ground by her evil war criminal father and that's what they do now so to
[2:07:58.720 --> 2:08:03.560]  complete that game which MSNBC's make a brzezinski calls Mike Pompeo I want to
[2:08:03.560 --> 2:08:08.320]  be dictators but boy and of course Stephen Colbert what does he call
[2:08:08.320 --> 2:08:16.000]  Trump Putin's cock holster oh but if anybody else made a joke like that they
[2:08:16.000 --> 2:08:22.120]  be removed from air immediately make a brzezinski apologize if I call him up
[2:08:22.120 --> 2:08:27.120]  and pay I want to be dictators but boy to get in the nose meanwhile Kyler Murphy
[2:08:27.120 --> 2:08:30.960]  apologized for homophobic tweets that resurfaced after he won the Heisman
[2:08:30.960 --> 2:08:34.640]  Trophy and who was the guy that was about to be the the comedian at the
[2:08:34.640 --> 2:08:39.560]  Oscars oh he made jokes weren't even as bad but he's a man so he doesn't get to
[2:08:39.560 --> 2:08:45.200]  be at the Oscars Kevin Hart says he won't host Oscars after a few over
[2:08:45.200 --> 2:08:48.560]  homophobic tweets because you know you could joke about any group you want but
[2:08:48.560 --> 2:08:56.400]  not a liberal not a gay person no no no on and on and on it's insane now let's
[2:08:56.400 --> 2:09:01.920]  shift gears into this little jewel of a story because Morris happened I first
[2:09:01.920 --> 2:09:08.760]  mentioned this this morning turns out the Islamist was in Germany illegally he'd
[2:09:08.760 --> 2:09:16.040]  been convicted 20 plus times of serious crimes but the federal government of
[2:09:16.040 --> 2:09:24.640]  Germany which is globalist and runs the EU would not deport him then he went and
[2:09:24.640 --> 2:09:30.280]  shot in front of witnesses reportedly 12 people killing four Germans hijacked
[2:09:30.280 --> 2:09:38.440]  carjacked a taxicab and drove away and escaped to another nation and he screamed
[2:09:38.440 --> 2:09:54.720]  that just made Sundar over at Google go I mean it was a moment of ecstasy Muslim
[2:09:54.720 --> 2:09:58.600]  Council leader upset at media for accurately reporting on Islamic terror
[2:09:58.600 --> 2:10:07.080]  Paul Joseph Watson in foe wars dot com get that article out and by the way
[2:10:07.080 --> 2:10:10.200]  speaking of Google you know they're moving into the former Eastern Berlin
[2:10:10.200 --> 2:10:14.040]  and the former Stasi headquarters for all of Eastern Germany and they're not
[2:10:14.040 --> 2:10:17.920]  just hiring former Stasi like Facebook is they're moving into the former
[2:10:17.920 --> 2:10:25.920]  headquarters Google is to help censor everyone you can't make that up
[2:10:25.920 --> 2:10:34.440]  sometimes like Stasi help I move in it's good American dream Muslim Council
[2:10:34.440 --> 2:10:38.520]  leader upset at media for accurately reporting on Islamic terror attack
[2:10:38.520 --> 2:10:42.720]  claims a lot mark shout should not have appeared in headlines that's right
[2:10:42.720 --> 2:10:48.480]  there's no Muslims killing anybody a spokesman for the Muslim Council of
[2:10:48.480 --> 2:10:52.800]  Britain expresses disappointment at the media today for accurately reporting
[2:10:52.800 --> 2:10:56.080]  that an Islamic terrorist who killed three people and injured dozens more in
[2:10:56.080 --> 2:11:01.800]  Strasburg shouted God is great in Arabic during the attack
[2:11:01.800 --> 2:11:06.120]  disappointing to see BBC and Sky News leave with all a block bar in their
[2:11:06.120 --> 2:11:15.640]  headline on the awful shooting of Strasburg and it goes on meanwhile it's
[2:11:15.640 --> 2:11:20.680]  getting worse Strasburg Christian market gum and shut it all out bar open
[2:11:20.680 --> 2:11:25.880]  border Strasburg terrorist evades police escapes
[2:11:25.880 --> 2:11:32.080]  I just think of Strasburg as Germany's all-Australian Empire Strasburg gunman
[2:11:32.080 --> 2:11:44.560]  had 27 prior convictions RT reports 27 but Germany Strasburg Austria Sweden he
[2:11:44.560 --> 2:11:49.000]  lived and all he just he just runs around murdering killing robbing stealing
[2:11:49.000 --> 2:11:52.600]  and he's just allowed to because well we have to virtue signal kind of like the
[2:11:52.600 --> 2:11:56.440]  legal alien that shot the white woman in the back with her father and the
[2:11:56.440 --> 2:12:03.760]  services go said no jail time murder everyone she's white she died
[2:12:03.760 --> 2:12:08.960]  meanwhile the average quote minority doesn't like this they don't want to be
[2:12:08.960 --> 2:12:13.200]  part of this but the injustices are being carried out to make everyone hate
[2:12:13.200 --> 2:12:19.320]  each other because how do you control a prison most prisons have the white
[2:12:19.320 --> 2:12:23.160]  supremacist the black supremacist and the Mexican supremacist if you're on the
[2:12:23.160 --> 2:12:26.200]  East or West Coast you'll have it in four groups you'll have the Asian gangs
[2:12:26.200 --> 2:12:33.760]  the white gangs the black gangs the Mexican gangs and that's it and yeah the
[2:12:33.760 --> 2:12:38.000]  crew mentions that good point we talked about this like two years ago with
[2:12:38.000 --> 2:12:42.720]  Evergreen College and Missouri State and all those said we're gonna have
[2:12:42.720 --> 2:12:46.040]  weekends where no white people are allowed and folks are like I have a
[2:12:46.040 --> 2:12:52.600]  dorm here I I'm studying listen whitey you know I'm with oppressions like but
[2:12:52.600 --> 2:12:58.200]  I'm not involved in it that was a long time ago we're gonna learn but it's all
[2:12:58.200 --> 2:13:01.920]  about the exercise of power and so professors that were even liberals who
[2:13:01.920 --> 2:13:07.400]  didn't want to leave they got fired remember wait you don't want to not come
[2:13:07.400 --> 2:13:18.000]  in for your ass is fired racist and so American University students and staff
[2:13:18.000 --> 2:13:22.280]  called for minority only spaces on campus to promote inclusion I'm gonna say
[2:13:22.280 --> 2:13:30.200]  that again minority only spaces to promote inclusion and San Francisco is
[2:13:30.200 --> 2:13:36.720]  gonna create transgender districts where the transgenders live it's all called
[2:13:36.720 --> 2:13:39.960]  divide and conquer
[2:13:42.400 --> 2:13:50.640]  27 convictions for rape robbery stabbing people everything and free as a
[2:13:50.640 --> 2:13:57.520]  bird how about you know three strikes you're out no how about 25 strikes you're
[2:13:57.520 --> 2:14:04.600]  out no I've got articles today in my stack I can't find it now where major
[2:14:04.600 --> 2:14:10.600]  Democratic Party groups are saying abolish ICE and all police oh that's a
[2:14:10.600 --> 2:14:16.160]  really good idea you know what maybe it is a good idea because if there was no
[2:14:16.160 --> 2:14:23.920]  more law and order because I've been trying to fix things peacefully but if
[2:14:23.920 --> 2:14:31.000]  there was no more law and order and there was no more due process and it was
[2:14:31.000 --> 2:14:36.600]  like the purge who would you bet on the would you bet on the Americana right
[2:14:36.600 --> 2:14:42.840]  wingers the free market guys or would you bet on the leftist oh I don't think
[2:14:42.840 --> 2:14:46.800]  the leftist would do too well in that fight I I don't think they would be
[2:14:46.800 --> 2:14:51.160]  walking around above ground for too long I think they'd be pushing days he's very
[2:14:51.160 --> 2:14:55.760]  quickly and by the way I don't have some bloodlust to kill anybody killing
[2:14:55.760 --> 2:15:01.560]  people's like well brushing your teeth harder wiping your ass is harder and
[2:15:01.560 --> 2:15:07.880]  killing people I mean killing people is second nature in a barbarous society now
[2:15:07.880 --> 2:15:11.880]  not everybody has the instincts to kill people so I get that people that aren't
[2:15:11.880 --> 2:15:17.920]  endowed with the instincts or cursed with them think it's powerful if you have
[2:15:17.920 --> 2:15:22.520]  the instincts to kill people it's kind of like opening a bottle cap on a can of
[2:15:22.520 --> 2:15:26.440]  Coca-Cola or a bottle of Coca-Cola it's it's not a big thing but see the left is
[2:15:26.440 --> 2:15:30.200]  obsessed with killing babies they can't kill them when they're a baby they want
[2:15:30.200 --> 2:15:33.320]  to give them riddling or whatever to brain damage them or they want to tell
[2:15:33.320 --> 2:15:39.080]  boys or girls they just want to hurt children so at a certain point all these
[2:15:39.080 --> 2:15:43.840]  bullies on a game of one children what's gonna happen when the men show up but
[2:15:43.840 --> 2:15:50.560]  where are the men where are the men let's see I'm not a sadist but I do like to
[2:15:50.560 --> 2:15:54.360]  hurt bad people well they're right back

[2:18:21.720 --> 2:18:25.640]  heart that we've got to maintain the fight as hard as possible and go through
[2:18:25.640 --> 2:18:30.320]  as much as we can to be an example to others and carry out critical operations
[2:18:30.320 --> 2:18:34.280]  ahead of whatever happens but I want to be strong in this fight I need to be

[2:19:25.600 --> 2:19:29.800]  open free society against the globalist and the dominant world force they've
[2:19:29.800 --> 2:19:32.680]  created a tower of babel with a bunch of people that can't communicate with each
[2:19:32.680 --> 2:19:37.280]  other but we have cut right to the chase human liberty a pro-human future

[2:20:21.400 --> 2:20:40.560]  you know I look at these globalists and I don't want to be them I mean almost all
[2:20:40.560 --> 2:20:46.600]  their children end up committing suicide or in mental institutions and they all
[2:20:46.600 --> 2:20:52.440]  are incredibly unhappy people and then they're building this big AI thing
[2:20:52.440 --> 2:20:57.920]  using technology we developed and telling us they're gods this isn't gonna go
[2:20:57.920 --> 2:21:05.520]  too well so why don't we all do our films a favor and decide we're not gonna
[2:21:05.520 --> 2:21:10.240]  bow down to these people and not be afraid of their social scores of their
[2:21:10.240 --> 2:21:15.320]  intimidation and just say listen I'm not looking for a fight
[2:21:15.320 --> 2:21:21.080]  you started it Mr. so we're gonna go ahead to the end no matter what the cost
[2:21:21.080 --> 2:21:27.680]  is and you're gonna find out what it's really like to fight
[2:21:31.520 --> 2:21:35.320]  Gavin McGinnis is about to land in Austin Texas he's gonna be in studio
[2:21:35.320 --> 2:21:38.000]  with us tomorrow with big breaking news obviously he might be on the war room
[2:21:38.000 --> 2:21:42.400]  today we've got a few interesting things they're coming up but they've been
[2:21:42.400 --> 2:21:46.120]  trying to de-platform him everywhere because he's a nationalist he's pro
[2:21:46.120 --> 2:21:52.240]  human he knows there's a war against men that's what we're dealing with but I
[2:21:52.240 --> 2:21:55.880]  was getting into make a presence key you know saying that the Secretary of
[2:21:55.880 --> 2:21:59.840]  State Michael Pompeo is a wannabe dictators but boy and look I think she
[2:21:59.840 --> 2:22:06.720]  has a right to say that it's free speech whatever but if someone else called
[2:22:06.720 --> 2:22:10.440]  a Democrat a but boy she'd be calling for them to be taken off the air so I
[2:22:10.440 --> 2:22:17.640]  don't like that double standard that's what I don't like that's what frustrates
[2:22:17.640 --> 2:22:29.080]  me at the end of the day I'm just tired of everyone bowing down to the corporate
[2:22:29.080 --> 2:22:32.560]  media that has almost no viewers so like when they say something we've all got
[2:22:32.560 --> 2:22:36.600]  to get scared go oh my god oh my god you don't want them to talk bad about you
[2:22:36.600 --> 2:22:41.160]  they have no power they're a joke but who cares if they had power who cares if
[2:22:41.160 --> 2:22:46.040]  they could hurt you isn't it worse to just give in to them always and care what
[2:22:46.040 --> 2:22:51.360]  they have to say and care what they do when they're a bunch of lying trash
[2:22:52.320 --> 2:22:58.760]  don't you want to stand up against them don't you want to say no to them and
[2:22:58.760 --> 2:23:04.680]  not let them control every facet of your life you know last night flying in on
[2:23:04.680 --> 2:23:08.880]  the airplane I was sending messages to the producers about all these clips I
[2:23:08.880 --> 2:23:14.880]  wanted them to get and I haven't played nearly one up played a few and it dealt
[2:23:14.880 --> 2:23:20.600]  with all the perjury of Sundar Pachai of the so-called CEO of Google and I say
[2:23:20.600 --> 2:23:23.560]  that because he's a complete frontman
[2:23:25.760 --> 2:23:31.760]  but I've got to admit to you even though the Republicans had some proof and went
[2:23:31.760 --> 2:23:36.560]  over some points of admitted red flag censorship by Google of conservatives
[2:23:36.560 --> 2:23:43.840]  and nationalists I'd give them a c-minus the amount of total evidence of
[2:23:43.840 --> 2:23:48.560]  Google's absolute support of authoritarianism not just against
[2:23:48.560 --> 2:23:52.640]  America but the people of the planet and just what a ruthless evil company they
[2:23:52.640 --> 2:23:56.480]  are and the fact their slogan is don't be evil that should tell you whoa this is
[2:23:56.480 --> 2:24:02.120]  some evil ass people because the devil's gonna tell you he's Jesus Christ and to
[2:24:02.120 --> 2:24:08.600]  just sit back and look at those folks and realize where they stand and realize
[2:24:08.600 --> 2:24:15.560]  what they're pushing will make your head spin now I'm about to play right now a
[2:24:15.560 --> 2:24:22.320]  clip a compilation of Congressman Deutsch and Congressman Swallows well and
[2:24:22.320 --> 2:24:26.320]  others and I think Hank Johnson's in this around Hank Johnson the guy said
[2:24:26.320 --> 2:24:30.440]  islands float and go on I said was that satire when you said that he didn't
[2:24:30.440 --> 2:24:35.000]  really know what I was saying but it was a very friendly fellow so we've got this
[2:24:35.000 --> 2:24:37.960]  compilation from some of the stuff you probably haven't seen from the Google
[2:24:37.960 --> 2:24:44.120]  hearings yesterday and then we've got a special guest joining us who dared to say
[2:24:44.120 --> 2:24:48.520]  that white people have made contributions to civilization that itself is
[2:24:48.520 --> 2:24:52.960]  white supremacist because if you say white people aren't scum and aren't bad
[2:24:52.960 --> 2:24:56.520]  because of their skin color you're inherently evil you are a bad person
[2:24:56.520 --> 2:24:59.680]  again let's remember it's Google and the Democrats and the globalists that are
[2:24:59.680 --> 2:25:03.040]  trying to teach all the quote minorities trying to get into the country that
[2:25:03.040 --> 2:25:08.760]  whites are inherently bad to create a longer head so here is that report from
[2:25:08.760 --> 2:25:12.680]  yesterday in the Judiciary Committee or outside the Judiciary Committee with the
[2:25:12.680 --> 2:25:16.880]  cockroaches running for the hills here it is we got to get it tight get it
[2:25:16.880 --> 2:25:23.600]  right this is kind of an unwieldy situation to me good to meet you too good
[2:25:23.600 --> 2:25:28.160]  luck to you man it's cool I'll see you on the wall
[2:25:32.480 --> 2:25:38.240]  he's always Google executives and Facebook executives and Twitter
[2:25:38.240 --> 2:25:44.720]  executives go before Congress and they tell Congress that they're not censoring
[2:25:44.720 --> 2:25:48.120]  anybody even though we have all the Google Documents we have internal Google
[2:25:48.120 --> 2:25:52.160]  videos we have internal Twitter videos where their executives talk about how
[2:25:52.160 --> 2:25:54.520]  they're censoring everyone
[2:25:54.520 --> 2:25:56.520]  I think they've done some hearings right here
[2:25:56.520 --> 2:25:58.520]  let's go over here
[2:26:01.520 --> 2:26:05.800]  Sundar you know Google is helping China with Dragonfly and you know that they're
[2:26:05.800 --> 2:26:09.720]  helping censor and you know you know that you've sold this country out you
[2:26:09.720 --> 2:26:12.640]  won't even help the Pentagon you'll help the Chikoms you bet on the wrong
[2:26:12.640 --> 2:26:22.080]  country Sundar Google is evil Google is evil Google is evil Google is evil Google
[2:26:22.080 --> 2:26:26.960]  is evil Google is signing with the Chinese against America
[2:26:26.960 --> 2:26:31.280]  Google is helping arrest Chinese dissidents Christians and Buddhists
[2:26:31.280 --> 2:26:37.800]  Google is evil Google is going to lie again and violate the law and violate
[2:26:37.800 --> 2:26:41.760]  all the problems you're in a hallway in a public hallway you can be arrested
[2:26:41.760 --> 2:26:46.560]  that's not making too much noise so Google's not evil I'm not saying that
[2:26:46.560 --> 2:26:50.120]  just control yourself okay get under control now I'm under control thank you

[2:32:06.880 --> 2:32:10.440]  consisted of the things that we're willing to fight for the First Amendment the
[2:32:10.440 --> 2:32:13.920]  Bill of Rights the rest of the Bill of Rights are prohibitions they're
[2:32:13.920 --> 2:32:18.520]  prohibitions against powerful organizations and individuals taking

[2:32:22.360 --> 2:32:25.680]  because they're taking them right now
[2:32:26.200 --> 2:32:31.200]  we have seen what they want to do they called it UN Agent 21 now they call it
[2:32:31.200 --> 2:32:36.280]  the UN 2030 agenda they want everybody off of the rural lands they want people
[2:32:36.280 --> 2:32:40.520]  out of the suburbs they want to pack everybody into the cities because that's
[2:32:40.520 --> 2:32:46.680]  where it is easiest for them to control everyone it's the David Knight show
[2:32:46.680 --> 2:32:49.680]  I never missed your show, and he did
[2:32:49.680 --> 2:32:52.480]  and I mean, what? I mean, he never
[2:32:52.480 --> 2:32:57.480]  at info wars.com forward slash show
[2:32:57.480 --> 2:33:05.480]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:33:13.480 --> 2:33:21.480]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones
[2:33:21.480 --> 2:33:28.480]  we built the modern world we built the modern world European European built
[2:33:28.480 --> 2:33:36.320]  the modern world we invented science industry and you want to tell us to stop
[2:33:36.320 --> 2:33:42.000]  because oh my god we're so bad where did we invented the modern world I feel you
[2:33:42.000 --> 2:33:54.680]  invented the modern world we saved billions of people from starvation people are the
[2:33:54.680 --> 2:34:01.680]  best thing that ever happened to a world we are so amazing I love myself I love white people
[2:34:01.680 --> 2:34:15.680]  I don't hate other people I just love white people I just love white men
[2:34:31.680 --> 2:34:34.680]  me
[2:34:50.680 --> 2:34:57.520]  Julian von Abeli is our guest you saw a short clip of the viral video that's
[2:34:57.520 --> 2:35:04.240]  been on last week and he is a Columbia student targeted over drunken rant saying
[2:35:04.240 --> 2:35:08.800]  white people invented the modern world now again this is the big corporation
[2:35:08.800 --> 2:35:13.360]  trying to divide and conquer the average black person whatever it's not thinking
[2:35:13.360 --> 2:35:18.120]  or acting like this from my own experience but I've got news articles
[2:35:18.120 --> 2:35:22.760]  today were major universities saying we're gonna have zones only for minorities
[2:35:22.760 --> 2:35:29.000]  whites not allowed for inclusion and then we're told everywhere whites are
[2:35:29.000 --> 2:35:33.320]  inherently bad they're goblins that live in holes New York Times editorial board
[2:35:33.320 --> 2:35:39.160]  people so this is how they're trying to control people but I wanted to get him
[2:35:39.160 --> 2:35:42.280]  on so you can hear from him when he you know it wasn't late at night having a
[2:35:42.280 --> 2:35:46.360]  few drinks surrounded by some young black ladies flipping him off when he's
[2:35:46.360 --> 2:35:48.440]  saying all this but I just want to say this again
[2:35:48.440 --> 2:35:54.200]  Africa is great Latin America is great the whole world's great you can't deny
[2:35:54.200 --> 2:35:59.600]  the Western civilization gave us a navigation gave us the printing press
[2:35:59.600 --> 2:36:07.720]  gave us the clocks gave us the systems everything that we're based on today so
[2:36:07.720 --> 2:36:11.240]  the idea that it's bad a is a fraud to say any group of people are bad
[2:36:11.240 --> 2:36:16.560]  inherently but to also say that oh it's evil it's backwards but then you want
[2:36:16.560 --> 2:36:22.960]  to get into the countries that are Western so joining us is Julian von
[2:36:22.960 --> 2:36:29.440]  Aboulay and I want to talk about all this with him because he's been doxxed by
[2:36:29.440 --> 2:36:36.560]  SJW is and they are calling for his head for what you just saw and people also
[2:36:36.560 --> 2:36:41.000]  basically grab his face you know basically assaulted him that's being
[2:36:41.000 --> 2:36:45.720]  praised as well because to say that white people aren't inherently evil is now a
[2:36:45.720 --> 2:36:49.880]  thought crime so Julian thanks for coming on with us Alex thanks for
[2:36:49.880 --> 2:36:53.880]  inviting me on the show thanks for coming on so so you tell us what
[2:36:53.880 --> 2:36:57.960]  what happened what was behind the scenes what made you say this give us this
[2:36:57.960 --> 2:37:03.600]  whole story in context oh man well I was having an argument with a couple kids
[2:37:03.600 --> 2:37:08.800]  who were saying that Trump supporters endorse sexual assault I told him you
[2:37:08.800 --> 2:37:13.480]  know what I'm a Trump supporter and I don't endorse sexual assault and Trump
[2:37:13.480 --> 2:37:18.120]  certainly doesn't endorse sexual assault and they said that I was a privileged
[2:37:18.120 --> 2:37:21.760]  white male and that I have white privilege and a group of students
[2:37:21.760 --> 2:37:26.080]  gathered around me and basically accosted me for being a white man and
[2:37:26.080 --> 2:37:31.360]  expressing my opinions and you know what I stood up for myself and I said I love
[2:37:31.360 --> 2:37:39.040]  myself and I'm not going to hate myself for being a white man and so again
[2:37:39.040 --> 2:37:42.160]  because of what color you were because of your race you were surrounded by a mob
[2:37:42.160 --> 2:37:46.040]  you stood up and said you had values so for not saying you were a piece of crap
[2:37:46.040 --> 2:37:51.880]  you are now enemy number one exactly I mean I'm a massive public enemy I mean a
[2:37:51.880 --> 2:37:56.720]  CNN commentator literally told hundreds of thousands of people to destroy my
[2:37:56.720 --> 2:38:02.600]  life and stefa activists have threatened me they threatened to rob my dorm room
[2:38:02.600 --> 2:38:08.680]  my university has disavowed me I've been doxxed my personal information has been
[2:38:08.680 --> 2:38:12.880]  leaked on the internet all because you know what I stood up for myself and I
[2:38:12.880 --> 2:38:16.240]  said I believe in myself you know and maybe I went a little bit over the top
[2:38:16.240 --> 2:38:21.440]  you know but I was frustrated by being attacked for who I am by being attacked
[2:38:21.440 --> 2:38:27.120]  for my race and it happens so often on college campuses and it happens so often
[2:38:27.120 --> 2:38:36.760]  in cosmopolitan culture that I was just done apologizing for who I am and it's
[2:38:36.760 --> 2:38:41.080]  incredible how they dehumanize you because you're being told you're bad
[2:38:41.080 --> 2:38:45.160]  upfront the full clips on info wars.com that you're evil because you're white and
[2:38:45.160 --> 2:38:49.720]  then you just simply state some facts and then that's why you're bad I mean
[2:38:49.720 --> 2:38:54.000]  this is wild what the universities the atmosphere that they've created why do
[2:38:54.000 --> 2:38:58.720]  you think the universities are creating this atmosphere what's the end game well
[2:38:58.720 --> 2:39:04.560]  look I'm not really a political person believed or not but I am I'm pretty
[2:39:04.560 --> 2:39:09.240]  scared personally about the atmosphere that's emerging on college campuses and
[2:39:09.240 --> 2:39:16.280]  more broadly in urban American society there seems to be a powerful group of
[2:39:16.280 --> 2:39:20.800]  people who hate the basic principles of our society they hate free expression
[2:39:20.800 --> 2:39:27.360]  they hate Western civilization and they demonize a group of people okay and
[2:39:27.360 --> 2:39:31.880]  these students who accosted me brought up white men I did not bring up race they
[2:39:31.880 --> 2:39:35.240]  brought up race in the context of demonizing I brought up race in the
[2:39:35.240 --> 2:39:39.120]  context of defending who I am but there's a powerful group of people who
[2:39:39.120 --> 2:39:45.680]  hate white men or who want to spread hatred of white men and demonize them
[2:39:45.680 --> 2:39:50.760]  and basically blame all of the ills of our society on white men and I'm just
[2:39:50.760 --> 2:39:54.040]  done with it you know I don't I don't hate anybody I said that in the video
[2:39:54.040 --> 2:39:59.360]  I'm not a racist okay obviously inherently right all these folks want to get
[2:39:59.360 --> 2:40:03.440]  into Western civilization it's so horrible why are you trying to get here
[2:40:03.440 --> 2:40:09.640]  right exactly I mean if the United States and Western civilization was so evil
[2:40:09.640 --> 2:40:14.480]  so reprehensibly evil then why are so many millions of people trying to come
[2:40:14.480 --> 2:40:18.040]  to the United States well the truth is they're getting here for a lot of good
[2:40:18.040 --> 2:40:21.880]  reasons and bad reasons but they're being organized into a political weapon by
[2:40:21.880 --> 2:40:26.640]  the Democrats I mean that's really the end game here right right I mean look
[2:40:26.640 --> 2:40:33.000]  just just personally I'm I'm done with the society that I lived in with the
[2:40:33.000 --> 2:40:37.440]  society that was built by basically Western culture and Western values and
[2:40:37.440 --> 2:40:41.920]  individualism opened itself was egalitarian right and is now being
[2:40:41.920 --> 2:40:47.280]  raped in the rear end and told we rule you exactly we've let in people and
[2:40:47.280 --> 2:40:51.080]  it's not just that they're brown or black or white doesn't matter we've led in
[2:40:51.080 --> 2:40:55.680]  people to be organized by globalists in a giant conquering operation that's all
[2:40:55.680 --> 2:41:02.760]  this is right exactly I mean look what I said in the video what I really meant
[2:41:02.760 --> 2:41:06.800]  was essentially that Western civilization is the greatest society that
[2:41:06.800 --> 2:41:10.160]  has ever existed and I'm not gonna back down from saying that we're basically
[2:41:10.160 --> 2:41:14.560]  the first society to understand the human individual as a person as a human
[2:41:14.560 --> 2:41:19.120]  being to allow for free expression okay we're the civilization that created the
[2:41:19.120 --> 2:41:23.480]  most technologically advanced culture in human history and the basic
[2:41:23.480 --> 2:41:29.320]  principles of our society are under attack and and I'm done putting up with
[2:41:29.320 --> 2:41:36.400]  our society being under attack okay and I think that the Western society is the
[2:41:36.400 --> 2:41:41.760]  greatest society in history and if we're under attack I'm scared about about who
[2:41:41.760 --> 2:41:46.520]  is pushing and I'm scared of what the consequences will be of a society that
[2:41:46.520 --> 2:41:51.680]  doesn't value human individuals and free expression but demonizes particular
[2:41:51.680 --> 2:41:57.480]  racial groups and says that basically all the ills of the world are because of
[2:41:57.480 --> 2:42:04.200]  conflicts between social and racial groups okay we come back then I want you
[2:42:04.200 --> 2:42:08.160]  to do your real rant I want you to have the floor I want you to really rant
[2:42:08.160 --> 2:42:11.400]  about Western civilization because it's true I mean they're gonna ban Jim
[2:42:11.400 --> 2:42:18.360]  Morrison I forget which song it is but it's maybe come on baby lie my fire try
[2:42:18.360 --> 2:42:23.200]  to set my night on fire but he says the West is the best and it's gonna do the
[2:42:23.200 --> 2:42:27.240]  rest the issue is the West is for everybody no matter what color you are
[2:42:27.240 --> 2:42:31.760]  where you came from if you believe in the human spirit and liberty it's what
[2:42:31.760 --> 2:42:35.440]  ended slavery all over the world it's what empowered women the West is the
[2:42:35.440 --> 2:42:39.960]  classical liberal and the authoritarians poses the liberal take it over and then
[2:42:39.960 --> 2:42:45.600]  attack the the mothership of the West that is bringing the world the Renaissance

[2:46:57.560 --> 2:47:21.800]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:47:21.800 --> 2:47:28.400]  Alex Jones here back live Julian von Abelie the student studying
[2:47:28.400 --> 2:47:32.800]  theoretic physics mathematics at Columbia University is a passion for
[2:47:32.800 --> 2:47:35.120]  exploring different ways but understanding the world from the
[2:47:35.120 --> 2:47:39.560]  perspective of mathematics creating cosmological theories that express the
[2:47:39.560 --> 2:47:44.760]  experience of God wrote two books on his apparel universe theories in high
[2:47:44.760 --> 2:47:49.320]  school more recently in colleges develop a new understanding of cosmology and
[2:47:49.320 --> 2:47:54.120]  quantum field theory such as how all cosmic histories interfere in a
[2:47:54.120 --> 2:48:00.800]  timeless universal matrix or integrate he has also been a free spirit willing
[2:48:00.800 --> 2:48:04.440]  to express himself and challenge the status quo whether this be academic
[2:48:04.440 --> 2:48:09.800]  establishment or physicist or general cultural environment he's at von Abelie
[2:48:09.800 --> 2:48:15.280]  VON AB ELE on Twitter for now another calling for you to be banned off
[2:48:15.280 --> 2:48:19.880]  Twitter we're calling for you to be kicked out of school go back to when this
[2:48:19.880 --> 2:48:24.280]  happened a few nights ago you're surrounded by women poking you pushing
[2:48:24.280 --> 2:48:28.160]  you because you're a white male it's just basically like a gang like the
[2:48:28.160 --> 2:48:33.400]  warriors or something warriors come out and play a that's what this has become
[2:48:33.400 --> 2:48:37.400]  at these universities they tell them you're downtrodden and then of course
[2:48:37.400 --> 2:48:41.160]  no one's down trying anybody and then they come up and get in your face and
[2:48:41.160 --> 2:48:44.200]  and and then now you're the bad guy for saying white people are good white
[2:48:44.200 --> 2:48:47.200]  people aren't bad I mean this is kind of beyond saying it's okay to be white
[2:48:47.200 --> 2:48:50.880]  which Martin Luther King would obviously say so let's let's get into your
[2:48:50.880 --> 2:48:55.000]  background what happened that night where you think this is all going oh yeah
[2:48:55.000 --> 2:49:00.120]  Alex well you know I was just pissed off being surrounded by a mob of people who
[2:49:00.120 --> 2:49:04.360]  were attacking my identity and I wasn't how did it start they just saw there's a
[2:49:04.360 --> 2:49:08.800]  white guy or what happened well it started when a couple students were
[2:49:08.800 --> 2:49:12.960]  talking about how Trump endorses sexual assault and I told him you know what I'm
[2:49:12.960 --> 2:49:17.360]  a Trump supporter and I don't endorse sexual assault and a large group of
[2:49:17.360 --> 2:49:22.800]  students gathered around me and accused me of having white privilege and
[2:49:22.800 --> 2:49:27.040]  basically told me that because of my identity because I'm white that I've
[2:49:27.040 --> 2:49:30.800]  got something to apologize for I told him you know what I have nothing to
[2:49:30.800 --> 2:49:36.240]  apologize for I'm gonna stand up for who I am I'm gonna stand up for what I
[2:49:36.240 --> 2:49:40.480]  believe and I'm gonna stand up for the values of the society that I live in but
[2:49:40.480 --> 2:49:44.360]  because of that because I stood up for myself I'm being attacked by the media
[2:49:44.360 --> 2:49:50.120]  relentlessly you know as I said a CNN commentator told people to destroy my
[2:49:50.120 --> 2:49:55.600]  life I've been harassed by leftist mobs on the internet I've been harassed by
[2:49:55.600 --> 2:50:01.360]  Antifa my family has been threatened and look I'm gonna stand strong and I'm not
[2:50:01.360 --> 2:50:06.120]  gonna put up with it I'm sick and tired of apologizing for who I am and I'm sick
[2:50:06.120 --> 2:50:13.200]  and tired of a society that that can't accept free expression so you know that
[2:50:13.200 --> 2:50:16.800]  that's that's the situation and let's expand on that because I've seen you
[2:50:16.800 --> 2:50:20.240]  demonized everywhere but so the specifics of the CNN will pull it up for
[2:50:20.240 --> 2:50:23.840]  TV and radio listeners so they can see it and hear it but yeah they've been
[2:50:23.840 --> 2:50:27.400]  calling for you to be docks you to be destroyed at CNN that goes to old women's
[2:50:27.400 --> 2:50:30.840]  houses it says you're Russian agents it's CNN that when somebody makes a meme
[2:50:30.840 --> 2:50:34.120]  about Trump body slamming CNN they threaten to destroy his life I mean
[2:50:34.120 --> 2:50:39.480]  these are real bullies oh absolutely and they're so disingenuous too with the
[2:50:39.480 --> 2:50:44.040]  way that they reported my statement also the Associated Press as well they
[2:50:44.040 --> 2:50:48.400]  didn't publish my full statement they completely editorialized it they made
[2:50:48.400 --> 2:50:53.760]  me seem weak and I'm not gonna put up with that you know I'm I'm sick of the
[2:50:53.760 --> 2:51:00.400]  fake news media demonizing people and I'm sick of the media attacking people
[2:51:00.400 --> 2:51:07.800]  for for what they say what do you think their in game is when you turn on the
[2:51:07.800 --> 2:51:11.240]  news it's all race-based politics you read WikiLeaks they admit they want to
[2:51:11.240 --> 2:51:14.440]  create division racially because the globalist don't want to deliver economic
[2:51:14.440 --> 2:51:20.000]  freedom they want to deliver in fighting absolutely they want to destroy the
[2:51:20.000 --> 2:51:25.120]  basic bonds of our society I mean that's what I feel like they're relentlessly
[2:51:25.120 --> 2:51:29.960]  attacking social unity they want to split people up into groups that's their end
[2:51:29.960 --> 2:51:35.320]  game so what is it like on Columbia University because I understand
[2:51:35.320 --> 2:51:38.480]  university still has some value but most of the degrees are worthless it's
[2:51:38.480 --> 2:51:43.080]  become mainly a brainwashing factory I mean I have four children if they want
[2:51:43.080 --> 2:51:46.800]  to go to college they can but you know I went to college a few years it was just
[2:51:46.800 --> 2:51:50.880]  a bunch of brainwashing what it just seems like it's become one of those
[2:51:50.880 --> 2:51:56.200]  anti-western anti-American organizations is that they're even set foot on one of
[2:51:56.200 --> 2:52:05.240]  these anti-free speech facilities yeah I mean Columbia's campus more generally
[2:52:05.240 --> 2:52:11.400]  I feel most university campuses in the country are utterly conformist I mean
[2:52:11.400 --> 2:52:16.000]  intellectually everyone says the same buzzwords everyone believes the same
[2:52:16.000 --> 2:52:23.560]  thing everyone demonizes white men and Western civilization and there's really
[2:52:23.560 --> 2:52:29.960]  a limited avenue for free expression I mean let me give you an example if you
[2:52:29.960 --> 2:52:34.000]  look at the Columbia student newspaper you know 20 years ago most of the
[2:52:34.000 --> 2:52:38.360]  stories were normal they were talking about students experiences and today if
[2:52:38.360 --> 2:52:41.680]  you look at the student newspaper all the stories about students experiences
[2:52:41.680 --> 2:52:45.960]  are about their race and their gender and their sexual orientation it's it's
[2:52:45.960 --> 2:52:51.240]  just total intellectual conformity let's be clear the globalists don't want to
[2:52:51.240 --> 2:52:55.280]  debate between free market and Renaissance and globalism so they all
[2:52:55.280 --> 2:52:58.680]  make it about what color you are your sexual preference as a distraction because
[2:52:58.680 --> 2:53:02.040]  they really don't care at the end of the day and that's really the big secret
[2:53:02.040 --> 2:53:06.920]  here is their culture jamming and the globalists want to conquer the US roll
[2:53:06.920 --> 2:53:09.640]  it into this one-world government and they've been admit their own internal
[2:53:09.640 --> 2:53:13.720]  documents that's what this is is the actual sabotage of the culture so people
[2:53:13.720 --> 2:53:18.320]  are paying to go be brainwashed be given a worthless degree and be inducted into
[2:53:18.320 --> 2:53:25.200]  a cult of losers yeah I definitely think our society is headed in a sort of
[2:53:25.200 --> 2:53:31.800]  scary direction you know well I think on these echo chambers these universities
[2:53:31.800 --> 2:53:35.400]  these professors see the total power they've got and they think why not
[2:53:35.400 --> 2:53:39.440]  project this outward and they've got willing accomplices of the big tech
[2:53:39.440 --> 2:53:45.400]  giants and in the corporate media to actually try this operation absolutely I
[2:53:45.400 --> 2:53:49.880]  mean the tech giant scare me too because so much of our discourse and our
[2:53:49.880 --> 2:53:54.320]  expression is controlled by a couple of of huge corporations like Google and
[2:53:54.320 --> 2:53:58.320]  Facebook and Twitter and they're gonna have the ability to control what people
[2:53:58.320 --> 2:54:03.320]  say so how can we live in a free society where there's a couple huge
[2:54:03.320 --> 2:54:09.000]  corporations that have the total ability to censor people and to demonize
[2:54:09.000 --> 2:54:13.400]  people I mean I definitely experienced that being the subject of an internet
[2:54:13.400 --> 2:54:18.040]  hate mob the internet companies and the tech companies have so much power over
[2:54:18.040 --> 2:54:22.520]  what people say I want to go to break come back and do five more minutes with
[2:54:22.520 --> 2:54:28.280]  you want to invite you back up for a full hour and but just talk about your
[2:54:28.280 --> 2:54:32.440]  experiences and what's like day-to-day on a university and where this is going
[2:54:32.440 --> 2:54:35.680]  because I mean I remember just 20 years ago I go speaking universities they'd
[2:54:35.680 --> 2:54:39.720]  ask me to speak now people ask me to speak and then about five days later
[2:54:39.720 --> 2:54:43.320]  it's always canceled and people have been threatened or they've they've been
[2:54:43.320 --> 2:54:48.240]  kicked out of the university major student groups I used to go speak at UT
[2:54:48.240 --> 2:54:53.640]  like in major halls with 4,000 2,000 people and now it's just no invites which
[2:54:53.640 --> 2:54:59.000]  which is fine I don't need that invite but it's like wow these places are not
[2:54:59.000 --> 2:55:03.640]  bashings of free speech we'll come back with the gentleman he's at Von Abel a
[2:55:03.640 --> 2:55:10.680]  VON a B ELE on Twitter Julian Von Abel is our gas will come back and finish up

[2:59:47.520 --> 3:00:04.760]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[3:00:04.760 --> 3:00:22.400]  this is the end beautiful friend this is the end my only friend the end
[3:00:22.400 --> 3:00:42.440]  of our elaborate plans the end no safety or surprise I'll never I'll never look
[3:00:42.440 --> 3:01:00.680]  into your eyes again this stuff can you picture so limitless and free
[3:01:12.440 --> 3:01:21.720]  Julian von Abelie is our guest he's a physicist student at Columbia and he's
[3:01:21.720 --> 3:01:27.680]  a bad guy being attacked by group of leftist women poking at him for saying
[3:01:27.680 --> 3:01:33.040]  wow the West has done incredible stuff everybody wants into the West but there
[3:01:33.040 --> 3:01:38.400]  is a social envy taught to people to then hate the West and taught to women
[3:01:38.400 --> 3:01:41.360]  that they're not part of the West and that men are their enemies this is a
[3:01:41.360 --> 3:01:46.520]  very diabolical plan by the big corporations so in closing Julian what
[3:01:46.520 --> 3:01:49.880]  do you want to add to the world cuz or what's a rant you'd like to say about
[3:01:49.880 --> 3:01:59.080]  the West a rant about the West well I think it's completely ironic that Western
[3:01:59.080 --> 3:02:05.880]  civilization is attacked for being a civilization that hurts people and for
[3:02:05.880 --> 3:02:09.840]  being a civilization that puts people down because you know what Western
[3:02:09.840 --> 3:02:14.880]  civilization has created the greatest living standards and most peace and the
[3:02:14.880 --> 3:02:19.760]  most opportunity for the most people of any society in history and I think it's
[3:02:19.760 --> 3:02:24.600]  time that we start to stand up for our values as a society when we're under a
[3:02:24.600 --> 3:02:30.760]  constant attack by a system that wants to bring down the basic principles of
[3:02:30.760 --> 3:02:35.280]  our civilization I mean that's that's how I feel as a person I feel like my
[3:02:35.280 --> 3:02:39.160]  identity is under attack and I feel like the values of the greatest society in
[3:02:39.160 --> 3:02:43.360]  history the society in which I live are under attack and I'm not gonna succumb
[3:02:43.360 --> 3:02:47.800]  to conformity I'm not gonna succumb to a system that wants to put us down I'm
[3:02:47.800 --> 3:02:53.000]  going to stand up for it and I hope you do too well you know the West is what
[3:02:53.000 --> 3:02:57.640]  began to try to end ill-equality and and try to empower everybody so the idea
[3:02:57.640 --> 3:03:01.480]  that we're then the problem no we've projected on to everybody that they are
[3:03:01.480 --> 3:03:06.960]  as open-hearted as we are and then bad players in the West have gone and tried
[3:03:06.960 --> 3:03:10.840]  to mobilize other groups to take down the West in an attempt to conquer it it
[3:03:10.840 --> 3:03:16.560]  is it is just insane exactly I mean look the West was the first society to end
[3:03:16.560 --> 3:03:21.240]  slavery the West was the first society to create equal legal rights for all
[3:03:21.240 --> 3:03:27.200]  people the West was the first society that essentially viewed individuals as
[3:03:27.200 --> 3:03:32.400]  individuals and not as part of some social or racial group okay look at the
[3:03:32.400 --> 3:03:36.920]  worst atrocities in history okay look at the Wikipedia article that lists the
[3:03:36.920 --> 3:03:40.520]  worst atrocities in the worst wars in history by death toll and what do you
[3:03:40.520 --> 3:03:45.040]  see it's not atrocities committed by the West it's atrocities committed by
[3:03:45.040 --> 3:03:49.480]  civilizations that didn't view individuals as individuals for the vast
[3:03:49.480 --> 3:03:54.240]  majority of human history okay it was standard procedure in a war when you
[3:03:54.240 --> 3:03:59.400]  sacked a city to kill everyone who lived there Western society was the first
[3:03:59.400 --> 3:04:03.480]  society to create a code of the rules of war it was the first society to respect
[3:04:03.480 --> 3:04:08.120]  civilian rights and war it was the first society that founded its its notion of
[3:04:08.120 --> 3:04:12.720]  ethics in the individual in the human person but the human person is being
[3:04:12.720 --> 3:04:15.560]  attacked but you but stay there when I come back I want you to finish these
[3:04:15.560 --> 3:04:19.280]  great points you're making years are dead on target they use our openness as
[3:04:19.280 --> 3:04:23.760]  our weakness you see they know we have this code and so they use it and tell us
[3:04:23.760 --> 3:04:27.520]  to subserve to them the globalist when they're actually overthrowing the whole
[3:04:27.520 --> 3:04:32.120]  thing when you come back and restart that so-called rant which is historical
[3:04:32.120 --> 3:04:37.560]  facts the truth is globalism is the disease western renaissance is the cure
[3:04:37.560 --> 3:04:41.680]  I'm Alex Jones stay with us
[3:04:53.240 --> 3:04:57.880]  the globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the
[3:04:57.880 --> 3:05:02.120]  environment full of the bad halogens fluoride chlorine bromide you name it that
[3:05:02.120 --> 3:05:07.320]  it lowers IQ it literally dumps the population down and on our quest to
[3:05:07.320 --> 3:05:11.640]  bring our listeners and viewers the best idea in the world we've gone through two
[3:05:11.640 --> 3:05:16.520]  permutations first seaweed based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source
[3:05:16.520 --> 3:05:20.120]  and the globalist tried to block us getting a supply of it so we discovered
[3:05:20.120 --> 3:05:24.480]  deep earth crystals a pure nascent iodine and brought you x2 that's been
[3:05:24.480 --> 3:05:28.920]  incredible now due to the establishment trying to block that we did more research
[3:05:28.920 --> 3:05:34.040]  and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine but chemist
[3:05:34.040 --> 3:05:37.560]  scientists and others showed us the research that by combining it with three
[3:05:37.560 --> 3:05:43.400]  other compounds two forms of iodine and vitamin C it super charges it and makes
[3:05:43.400 --> 3:05:48.520]  it even more bio available ladies and gentlemen you want to research it you
[3:05:48.520 --> 3:05:55.320]  want to see it it's an incredible discovery x3 now available at m4slife.com
[3:05:55.320 --> 3:06:14.320]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[3:06:55.320 --> 3:07:21.980]  there was a lady you're all totally changed my light once it shows Julian von
[3:07:21.980 --> 3:07:27.000]  Abel he's a really smart guy he saw his drunken rant he was surrounded by a
[3:07:27.000 --> 3:07:31.480]  bunch of harpy leftist brainwashed cult members at Columbia University when he's
[3:07:31.480 --> 3:07:35.000]  a physicist student telling him that he is an evil white devil and he said
[3:07:35.000 --> 3:07:39.020]  listen I'm not gonna sit here and hear my identity's bad I stand for what
[3:07:39.020 --> 3:07:42.800]  people stand for so you see we got Roger Stone coming up but I want you to
[3:07:42.800 --> 3:07:46.600]  start over because you got cut off by the break start over because this is
[3:07:46.600 --> 3:07:50.920]  important this is when you're not drunk about your treatise on western
[3:07:50.920 --> 3:07:55.720]  civilization ending slavery all the which is true and the printing press and
[3:07:55.720 --> 3:08:00.120]  medicine and the everything and the Hippocratic oath being adopted and and
[3:08:00.120 --> 3:08:05.720]  women empowerment and and all of this a culture of Renaissance not conquest
[3:08:05.720 --> 3:08:09.640]  doesn't mean we weren't both but we invented the Renaissance culture not
[3:08:09.640 --> 3:08:17.320]  conquest so lay it out for us absolutely Alex something remarkable has
[3:08:17.320 --> 3:08:23.200]  happened in the last three to four hundred years of human history since
[3:08:23.200 --> 3:08:28.720]  we've lived in civilization since we've had agricultural society for the vast
[3:08:28.720 --> 3:08:33.840]  majority of those 10,000 years the lives of the vast majority of people have been
[3:08:33.840 --> 3:08:40.400]  short and violent and brutish but something remarkable has happened in the
[3:08:40.400 --> 3:08:44.960]  last four hundred years because we finally managed to build a society that
[3:08:44.960 --> 3:08:50.880]  views individuals as persons individuals as persons and not as part of a social
[3:08:50.880 --> 3:08:57.000]  group okay I cited an example of looking at the worst atrocities in history if
[3:08:57.000 --> 3:09:01.640]  you look at wars throughout human history it was standard procedure to sack a
[3:09:01.640 --> 3:09:07.400]  city and kill everyone inside it was a standard procedure to take out revenge
[3:09:07.400 --> 3:09:13.120]  on an entire you know ethnic group on everyone with the same blood okay
[3:09:13.120 --> 3:09:18.240]  individuals were not viewed as persons but and I don't know if it's a
[3:09:18.240 --> 3:09:25.160]  combination of Christianity and Greco-Roman civilization but in media in
[3:09:25.160 --> 3:09:32.800]  medieval Europe a collection of ideas coalesced that viewed the individual as
[3:09:32.800 --> 3:09:39.640]  the embodiment of themselves and not as a representation of an ethnic group or a
[3:09:39.640 --> 3:09:44.320]  social group which is something very strongly sophisticated there the Romans
[3:09:44.320 --> 3:09:48.160]  were the first group because they would also kill everybody down to age 10 that
[3:09:48.160 --> 3:09:52.480]  were males but they were the first group that didn't have a super elitism
[3:09:52.480 --> 3:09:56.840]  outside of the patrician or where they would bring in outside groups and breed
[3:09:56.840 --> 3:10:00.400]  with them if they thought they had good genetics when no other outside group would
[3:10:00.400 --> 3:10:04.200]  do that so the Romans would bring in Germans, Visigoths, others and have sex
[3:10:04.200 --> 3:10:07.560]  with them and have kids because they thought their bloodline was strong so
[3:10:07.560 --> 3:10:11.800]  you're right the Germans even before the Christian ethos started opening up the
[3:10:11.800 --> 3:10:17.440]  genetic system and seeing things on an individual basis not on a group basis
[3:10:17.440 --> 3:10:23.160]  right exactly and seeing things on an individual basis is what has built the
[3:10:23.160 --> 3:10:28.040]  most prosperous and peaceful period in human history and it's such an amazing
[3:10:28.040 --> 3:10:34.160]  opportunity that I don't want this society to die but I feel like our basic
[3:10:34.160 --> 3:10:40.000]  principles are under threat because the genre of leftist identity politics
[3:10:40.000 --> 3:10:43.960]  doesn't believe in the individual it believes that everyone is part of a
[3:10:43.960 --> 3:10:49.560]  social or a racial group so really it's just a fallback to sort of default
[3:10:49.560 --> 3:10:54.200]  position of human history which is that there is no such thing as the
[3:10:54.200 --> 3:10:59.280]  individual which is that everyone is a representation of a blood or an ethnicity
[3:10:59.280 --> 3:11:04.480]  okay I don't want the most peaceful and prosperous society in human history to
[3:11:04.480 --> 3:11:08.880]  fall and I'm going to stand up for it and if that means turning myself into
[3:11:08.880 --> 3:11:14.640]  pariah if that means being attacked by the left-wing media I don't care because
[3:11:14.640 --> 3:11:18.720]  I'm going to stand up for Western civilization because I truly believe
[3:11:18.720 --> 3:11:23.720]  that it is the greatest civilization that has ever existed and it's an
[3:11:23.720 --> 3:11:29.320]  amazing opportunity for everyone in the world to live in a society and in a
[3:11:29.320 --> 3:11:34.040]  structure that is peaceful and prosperous and values the individual and
[3:11:34.040 --> 3:11:39.440]  values free expression and let's expand on that I go back to Martin Luther King
[3:11:39.440 --> 3:11:42.760]  he said judge someone individually and what they stand for what they do what
[3:11:42.760 --> 3:11:46.120]  they produce I'll go to your restaurant with your black white brown your foods
[3:11:46.120 --> 3:11:49.760]  good I listen to your music I don't give a damn what color you are that's common
[3:11:49.760 --> 3:11:54.480]  sense we we go off what people produce who they are individually to say like
[3:11:54.480 --> 3:11:58.160]  because you're from a group or a certain color then you must be bad but
[3:11:58.160 --> 3:12:02.600]  that's what the left is openly teaching that's what they're pushing and we know
[3:12:02.600 --> 3:12:06.760]  why this big global corporate takeover wants a bunch of divided and conquered
[3:12:06.760 --> 3:12:12.720]  groups they can manipulate and they are now double crossing the Western social
[3:12:12.720 --> 3:12:21.200]  compact or the Western social agreement and and they are they are breaking
[3:12:21.200 --> 3:12:26.160]  that while they tell all of us that have morals we're races do what we say
[3:12:26.160 --> 3:12:31.800]  they're the ones creating the race based cultural based system incredibly evil
[3:12:31.800 --> 3:12:37.920]  exactly I mean I do believe that it is evil Alex I do believe it is evil to
[3:12:37.920 --> 3:12:44.040]  blame all of the problems of society on essentially Western civilization because
[3:12:44.040 --> 3:12:47.440]  that's what the left because Western civilization doesn't compute with an
[3:12:47.440 --> 3:12:52.360]  authoritarian technocracy we're the cure man they don't want that everyone wants
[3:12:52.360 --> 3:12:55.960]  to get here not that we're perfect but because the little bit of freedom we
[3:12:55.960 --> 3:13:01.360]  had produced so much damn wealth obviously everyone wants it it's the best so
[3:13:01.360 --> 3:13:05.480]  again the power structure wants to erode it because it creates wealth of the
[3:13:05.480 --> 3:13:09.520]  general public you go to Whole Foods already left the publication oh we're
[3:13:09.520 --> 3:13:13.680]  too rich we have too much we need to be austere but then it's rich elitist with
[3:13:13.680 --> 3:13:19.960]  private jets telling us we can't have anything this is so damn obvious exactly
[3:13:19.960 --> 3:13:25.400]  it is obvious I mean who would want to restrict free expression corporations
[3:13:25.400 --> 3:13:29.680]  massive corporations and organizations the tech companies people who want to
[3:13:29.680 --> 3:13:36.440]  control citizens of our country okay if you have a society that does not value
[3:13:36.440 --> 3:13:40.560]  free expression if you have a society that does not value the person if you
[3:13:40.560 --> 3:13:44.960]  have a society that does not value individuals okay and that's a society
[3:13:44.960 --> 3:13:48.400]  where you can control people that's a society where you can manipulate people
[3:13:48.400 --> 3:13:52.160]  that's a society where you can put everyone into a little box and tell them
[3:13:52.160 --> 3:13:56.040]  to go to their little place and I don't want to live in that kind of exactly
[3:13:56.040 --> 3:13:59.800]  they want to tell you what your identity is instead of a renaissance identity
[3:13:59.800 --> 3:14:04.200]  that's everything and and true diversity but let's expand on that mm-hmm the
[3:14:04.200 --> 3:14:07.560]  reason the big corporations are so threatened is that they've brainwashed
[3:14:07.560 --> 3:14:11.160]  republicans that anything a corporation does is perfect they can do whatever they
[3:14:11.160 --> 3:14:14.800]  want but corporations are bigger than governments now they're acting as
[3:14:14.800 --> 3:14:18.840]  governmental institutions and they're showing their authoritarian bent so we
[3:14:18.840 --> 3:14:23.080]  then bring in government as the balance as the people's will to to not have
[3:14:23.080 --> 3:14:27.480]  prohibitions on freedom but prohibitions on suppression of freedom like big tech
[3:14:27.480 --> 3:14:30.360]  so you see the republicans saying why don't want to regulate big tech well big
[3:14:30.360 --> 3:14:35.640]  tech's already regulating government and elections and all of us we waged a war
[3:14:35.640 --> 3:14:41.800]  in 1775 and 1776 is for the next five years against the biggest corporation in
[3:14:41.800 --> 3:14:45.960]  the world the British East India Company that controlled England and so that's the
[3:14:45.960 --> 3:14:49.840]  issue we've now come back full circle is that by Congress not acting against
[3:14:49.840 --> 3:14:54.160]  Google and Facebook and Apple and Twitter you've let them become the new
[3:14:54.160 --> 3:14:58.880]  government we need government in limited level to be the shield to leave a level
[3:14:58.880 --> 3:15:03.080]  playing field and not allow monopolies that big corporations always seek
[3:15:03.080 --> 3:15:08.040]  exactly I think our country and our society is in a time of deep transition
[3:15:08.040 --> 3:15:13.280]  and I think that the standard concepts of how to protect free expression that is
[3:15:13.280 --> 3:15:17.320]  to prevent the government essentially from jailing people for what they say
[3:15:17.320 --> 3:15:21.960]  are outdated in a world where the tech companies have unprecedented power in
[3:15:21.960 --> 3:15:26.360]  controlling what people say and I think we have to stand up to the enormous and
[3:15:26.360 --> 3:15:31.120]  unprecedented power these massive internet and media corporations have
[3:15:31.120 --> 3:15:35.560]  over us as human beings and exactly they don't gel you they just unperson you
[3:15:35.560 --> 3:15:39.560]  with a social score you literally starved to death so now everyone must
[3:15:39.560 --> 3:15:44.160]  reevaluate the battlefield the consensus is forming and we're gonna win I want to

[3:20:53.400 --> 3:20:57.400]  country from total news coverage the Oval Office interview we got that video
[3:20:57.400 --> 3:21:05.440]  coming up I'm not concerned no yet I think the people would revolt if that
[3:21:05.440 --> 3:21:09.920]  happened we'll play that clip next segment coming up I saw this morning I
[3:21:09.920 --> 3:21:14.320]  was like wow that's amazing Roger was with me yesterday when we confronted
[3:21:14.320 --> 3:21:22.480]  Sundar the censor and his incredible perjury before Congress and then we
[3:21:22.480 --> 3:21:26.160]  look at Michael Cohen and the three years in prison and just all of this and
[3:21:26.160 --> 3:21:30.520]  the attempt to derail the stock market the economy and then the Democrats want
[3:21:30.520 --> 3:21:33.960]  to blame it on Trump will they get the blame of their successful who knows
[3:21:33.960 --> 3:21:38.120]  roger so much is going on I said body of your shit about four o'clock as your
[3:21:38.120 --> 3:21:42.040]  plane was taken off earlier than mine when you left the airport but I know a
[3:21:42.040 --> 3:21:46.000]  lot happened you know a day's like a year now what's front and center for you my
[3:21:46.000 --> 3:21:51.760]  friend well let's let me just say that I have never been prouder of you or of
[3:21:51.760 --> 3:21:56.600]  the Info Wars crew than when you went right into the lion's den yesterday and
[3:21:56.600 --> 3:22:02.200]  called out the epic liar Sundar who sat there in front of a committee of
[3:22:02.200 --> 3:22:08.480]  Congress and perjured himself over and over and over again oh no we're not
[3:22:08.480 --> 3:22:13.280]  tracking anybody on their devices oh no we're not helping the red Chinese a
[3:22:13.280 --> 3:22:18.840]  crackdown on dissidents and crush dissent and kill people oh no there's no
[3:22:18.840 --> 3:22:25.880]  program to to manipulate the search on conservatives or libertarians or Trump
[3:22:25.880 --> 3:22:31.760]  supporters or Republicans I mean this guy was incredible in his trail of lies
[3:22:31.760 --> 3:22:36.600]  and you showed enormous courage just going right in there going up to his
[3:22:36.600 --> 3:22:41.240]  face and calling him out I have never been prouder to be associated with you
[3:22:41.240 --> 3:22:47.920]  with Info Wars in my entire life it was a thrilling moment of true Democratic
[3:22:47.920 --> 3:22:53.360]  grassroots activism and I salute you and everybody watching the show should
[3:22:53.360 --> 3:22:58.560]  recognize your courage in calling him out well the Democrats attack people
[3:22:58.560 --> 3:23:01.960]  physically chain themselves the doors all this we didn't do that we said hey
[3:23:01.960 --> 3:23:06.040]  Sundar you're running slave operations in China you're helping spy on this since
[3:23:06.040 --> 3:23:09.360]  we just follow him down there I think all Americans should start looking at
[3:23:09.360 --> 3:23:13.240]  committee hearings and go to this themselves anybody can do this I mean
[3:23:13.240 --> 3:23:16.560]  this guy wouldn't even show up a few months ago to Congress remember how
[3:23:16.560 --> 3:23:20.760]  arrogant he was and it's Congress's ignorance what was it we were there for
[3:23:20.760 --> 3:23:26.040]  hours so let's go back to this let's say the lies of Sundar and like oh we
[3:23:26.040 --> 3:23:31.480]  don't spy oh we don't share data oh we don't censor it was disgusting well and
[3:23:31.480 --> 3:23:36.760]  the worst part about it was watching Jerry Nadler the congressman for Manhattan
[3:23:36.760 --> 3:23:42.240]  the incoming chairman of the Judiciary Committee if you believe the results of
[3:23:42.240 --> 3:23:45.400]  the last election which I'm not sure I respect because I think they were
[3:23:45.400 --> 3:23:50.960]  fraudulent but reading testimony that was written by Google lobbyists asking
[3:23:50.960 --> 3:23:55.840]  questions that were written by Google lobbyists and saying just with a straight
[3:23:55.840 --> 3:24:01.400]  face that there's no evidence whatsoever that conservatives or libertarians or
[3:24:01.400 --> 3:24:05.840]  Trump supporters or Republicans are being censored by Google or that their
[3:24:05.840 --> 3:24:10.040]  search engine results are being manipulated I mean just saying that now
[3:24:10.040 --> 3:24:17.320]  it is disclosed that Jerry Nadler took $26,000 from the alphabet company the
[3:24:17.320 --> 3:24:22.560]  parent company of Google so Jerry Nadler is compromised he's paid for he's
[3:24:22.560 --> 3:24:27.400]  corrupted he must step down no question he asks regarding any question should be
[3:24:27.400 --> 3:24:33.200]  answered he's disgraced he needs to step down and resign he's completely exposed
[3:24:33.200 --> 3:24:36.920]  what is going on at Google their world headquarters they they're down base in
[3:24:36.920 --> 3:24:40.880]  China got caught on fire today and had a bunch of floors burn out on whether
[3:24:40.880 --> 3:24:45.440]  executives died in New York a lot of weird stuff going on over at Google yeah
[3:24:45.440 --> 3:24:49.960]  it looks like a cover-up of some kind I'm not sure what it is they're seeking to
[3:24:49.960 --> 3:24:54.880]  cover up but you said it best yesterday Google is evil this is the
[3:24:54.880 --> 3:24:59.480]  personification of evil this morning I had an opportunity to read the
[3:24:59.480 --> 3:25:04.080]  transcripts of yesterday's hearings I must tell you the Republicans are a
[3:25:04.080 --> 3:25:09.200]  little a day late and a dollar short with the exception of Matt Gates and Jim
[3:25:09.200 --> 3:25:13.680]  Jordan it's not clear that any of the other Republicans there get it Louis
[3:25:13.680 --> 3:25:18.720]  Gohmert I think he did a good job the Democrats are just bogus I mean they're
[3:25:18.720 --> 3:25:23.480]  just bought and paid for but the most entertaining part of the day was actually
[3:25:23.480 --> 3:25:30.440]  was watching congressman flee from us run like children Eric Swallows well for
[3:25:30.440 --> 3:25:36.800]  example and look I give Hank credit Hank Johnson credit he was so dumb he hung
[3:25:36.800 --> 3:25:40.680]  around and tried to match wits with you but he didn't understand that you'll
[3:25:40.680 --> 3:25:46.960]  never fight an unarmed man I don't know I mean Hank Johnson he was lockable in
[3:25:46.960 --> 3:25:50.560]  person and I kept saying like you're joking around you say I don't float
[3:25:50.560 --> 3:25:55.640]  semen well I was just like you're right you like you know years later islands
[3:25:55.640 --> 3:26:01.600]  don't float right well I think he's probably too dumb to be duplicitous in
[3:26:01.600 --> 3:26:06.160]  all honesty doesn't seem like a bad fellow to me he's just reading a script
[3:26:06.160 --> 3:26:11.200]  prepared for him by others he's one of those go along to get along Democrats but
[3:26:11.200 --> 3:26:17.000]  I don't know Alex I watched the video this morning twice of Donald Trump with
[3:26:17.000 --> 3:26:21.920]  the leaders Pelosi and Schumer and then I watched the reports on CNN they must
[3:26:21.920 --> 3:26:26.320]  have seen a different video than I did because I think he owned them I think
[3:26:26.320 --> 3:26:29.200]  it's funny you say that let's play that when we come back because I haven't gotten
[3:26:29.200 --> 3:26:32.920]  to that I should I watched it too on the plane last night now they have wife on
[3:26:32.920 --> 3:26:37.360]  the planes I'm like watching stuff and I was like Trump was gracious he was nice
[3:26:37.360 --> 3:26:42.160]  they actually like chicken crap jackasses that's at all cheap and then it
[3:26:42.160 --> 3:26:46.600]  was like Trump's manhood challenge Trump destroyed by Pelosi and Schumer and it

[3:33:01.880 --> 3:33:19.320]  well let me tell you something I'm on a power trip it's the opposite there's
[3:33:19.320 --> 3:33:23.280]  when you're walking on the edge of a cliff you're on a power trip you've got
[3:33:23.280 --> 3:33:27.680]  your wave-o's up inside you but we're doing some incredibly historical things
[3:33:27.680 --> 3:33:32.560]  right now and don't just say this to patronize people it's because of you
[3:33:32.560 --> 3:33:39.080]  and that's not patronization it actually scares the hell out of me that it's
[3:33:39.080 --> 3:33:43.280]  like this epic fight I've been on there 23 years that every time we're about to
[3:33:43.280 --> 3:33:50.080]  get beat the listeners come through or Matt Drudge comes through or or some
[3:33:50.080 --> 3:33:53.880]  family member dies and I get you know half million dollars I put it in the
[3:33:53.880 --> 3:33:58.120]  company I started the company on my own my own money but over the years I've
[3:33:58.120 --> 3:34:04.080]  spent you know a few inheritance and things on this and then Hollywood tried
[3:34:04.080 --> 3:34:07.840]  to buy me off you know I thought I was oh I'm this great voiceover guy I'm being
[3:34:07.840 --> 3:34:13.400]  paid $800,000 for this voiceover and then I got a call you need to back off on
[3:34:13.400 --> 3:34:17.460]  this you want that voiceover contract renewed I went I thought my voice was
[3:34:17.460 --> 3:34:22.280]  that good but that's a pretty good payoff where the first time they didn't
[3:34:22.280 --> 3:34:27.680]  tell you it was a payoff the next time they tell you so here's the deal I'm
[3:34:27.680 --> 3:34:31.920]  telling listeners and viewers I'm a hundred percent in here and it's because
[3:34:31.920 --> 3:34:38.000]  I don't want to be some sneaky bastard that goes around screwing people over
[3:34:38.000 --> 3:34:42.080]  that's just not who I am and these globalists are out to get us all so the
[3:34:42.080 --> 3:34:47.800]  fact that you pray for us the fact that you support us the fact that you put us
[3:34:47.800 --> 3:34:54.000]  on the map that's not talk that that's you so I want people to fully get this
[3:34:54.000 --> 3:34:58.440]  through their brain if you get one thing because I was in DC and I was mobbed
[3:34:58.440 --> 3:35:02.120]  by Hispanic people and black people particularly I don't just say that to
[3:35:02.120 --> 3:35:06.160]  try to get a minority support the majority of people that will come up and
[3:35:06.160 --> 3:35:10.840]  tell me they love me and they heard the show in airports or on the road or at
[3:35:10.840 --> 3:35:15.400]  restaurants or black people in Hispanics and some white people but a lot of white
[3:35:15.400 --> 3:35:19.880]  folks that are liberals think they're the ruling class so they come get my face
[3:35:19.880 --> 3:35:26.080]  but they've got some weird white guilt I don't know what it is but all I'm
[3:35:26.080 --> 3:35:30.600]  telling you is the listeners of this broadcast are who brung us to the fight
[3:35:30.600 --> 3:35:36.600]  and you have to totally get it through your head and I don't mean this mean but
[3:35:36.600 --> 3:35:41.840]  I mean I want you to get it I want you to get it for real it isn't me saying
[3:35:41.840 --> 3:35:47.240]  you're included I don't patronize people I don't play virtue signaling crap you're
[3:35:47.240 --> 3:35:56.520]  not the info or you are the info or you're not part of it you're it so that's
[3:35:56.520 --> 3:36:02.280]  why they want to shut down it's not Alex Jones it's that they want Roger Stone
[3:36:02.280 --> 3:36:08.720]  shut down they want Paul Watson shut down they want Owen Schreuer shut down
[3:36:08.720 --> 3:36:13.360]  they want that amazing young man we had on earlier shutdown they don't like this
[3:36:13.360 --> 3:36:18.160]  uncontrolled forum and that's why they want the end of the free internet and
[3:36:18.160 --> 3:36:22.240]  that's why Roger you've got a lot to cover you mentioned this Trump thing I
[3:36:22.240 --> 3:36:25.160]  want to play it here but you'll be on the war room today coming up three to six
[3:36:25.160 --> 3:36:29.960]  p.m. but you and I were there we had real trouble listening to Sundar I mean
[3:36:29.960 --> 3:36:35.240]  God Almighty did he lie his ass off and it's hard for me to believe the
[3:36:35.240 --> 3:36:40.320]  Republicans are that stupid I know Google's the biggest lobbyist group in
[3:36:40.320 --> 3:36:45.120]  in even bigger than all companies but I mean is there money worth selling your
[3:36:45.120 --> 3:36:49.160]  whole culture out or can the Republicans take money to then destroy the party
[3:36:49.160 --> 3:36:55.720]  because this is like cyanide Google policy is cyanide to this country no
[3:36:55.720 --> 3:36:59.080]  Alex I think what we ought to do and maybe we should call Darren McBreen to
[3:36:59.080 --> 3:37:03.360]  get on this is to look at each Democrat and Republican member of the House
[3:37:03.360 --> 3:37:06.960]  Judiciary Committee and go back through their Federal Election Commission
[3:37:06.960 --> 3:37:12.440]  reports and see exactly who Google's controlling parent has given big money
[3:37:12.440 --> 3:37:16.440]  to that you're gonna find it all on the left think you can find very little of
[3:37:16.440 --> 3:37:21.520]  it on the right my problem with the House Republicans other than Gates and
[3:37:21.520 --> 3:37:25.800]  Jordan who were quite good yesterday quite crisp and clearly get it they've
[3:37:25.800 --> 3:37:30.840]  watched the project Veritas videos they've seen the internal memos the
[3:37:30.840 --> 3:37:34.680]  internal videos right out of Google headquarters that prove beyond a shadow
[3:37:34.680 --> 3:37:39.120]  of a doubt that conservatives and libertarians and Trump supporters and
[3:37:39.120 --> 3:37:44.280]  Republicans are being stifled are being censored that their search engine
[3:37:44.280 --> 3:37:49.360]  results are being manipulated is that they just don't get it they're not
[3:37:49.360 --> 3:37:55.360]  understanding the big picture it is only access to a vibrant and robust and
[3:37:55.360 --> 3:38:00.840]  completely accessible internet that the revolution can continue and prosper and
[3:38:00.840 --> 3:38:04.640]  without it we're gonna return to darkness and let's expand on this if
[3:38:04.640 --> 3:38:09.720]  Sundar Pachai showed up in a military uniform the Delta Force would have you
[3:38:09.720 --> 3:38:13.760]  know gone after him the fact that he shows up skinny jeans acting all liberal
[3:38:13.760 --> 3:38:18.640]  that's called camouflage boys these this is the army these these guys mean
[3:38:18.640 --> 3:38:23.480]  business they are kicking our ass so everybody but we're not fighting the
[3:38:23.480 --> 3:38:28.320]  last war we're not fighting tanks and missiles we're fighting AI man and
[3:38:28.320 --> 3:38:34.120]  Sundar Pachai he is the damn enemy well there's the irony because you and I
[3:38:34.120 --> 3:38:38.640]  stood feet away while Eric Swallows well accused me of perjury and before the
[3:38:38.640 --> 3:38:43.040]  House Intelligence Committee when there's big-time perjury going on in the next
[3:38:43.040 --> 3:38:49.080]  room where this guy is lying his ass off about everything about China about their
[3:38:49.080 --> 3:38:54.200]  tracking people about their systematic censorship and manipulation he said
[3:38:54.200 --> 3:38:59.360]  they're not even doing dragonfly dragonfly is already operational yeah so I
[3:38:59.360 --> 3:39:02.600]  mean in all honesty the House Republicans need to take his testimony
[3:39:02.600 --> 3:39:07.160]  they need to document the fact that he lied on point after point and they need
[3:39:07.160 --> 3:39:10.560]  to let's just be honest if we really wanted to stop but I'm on the
[3:39:10.560 --> 3:39:16.280]  authoritarian we're already so down the road we need I mean there's no half
[3:39:16.280 --> 3:39:19.520]  measures this point we're so down the rat hole Roger we've got our
[3:39:19.520 --> 3:39:24.840]  infrastructure we built seized by the chai comms a bunch of weird leftist
[3:39:24.840 --> 3:39:29.920]  traders like Sundar I mean we should we wait too long it's not gonna be good I
[3:39:29.920 --> 3:39:33.760]  mean the Pentagon needs to everybody's decide which side they're on and they
[3:39:33.760 --> 3:39:37.640]  need to move against big tech right now they sold the country out they screwed
[3:39:37.640 --> 3:39:41.000]  us over and if we let these pieces of crap do this to us we deserve we get
[3:39:41.000 --> 3:39:45.600]  that's all I'm saying well look I think that there is no question I spoke to a
[3:39:45.600 --> 3:39:49.240]  Bloomberg reporter this morning who tells me that based on everything he can
[3:39:49.240 --> 3:39:53.880]  learn the articles of impeachment vote being voted in the House against Donald
[3:39:53.880 --> 3:39:59.400]  Trump is inexorable this is coming but let's be very clear step one in their
[3:39:59.400 --> 3:40:05.280]  plan is the silencing of info wars it's crucial it's like killing Paul Revere
[3:40:05.280 --> 3:40:10.520]  we've got to shut down their early alert system we've got to shut down the voice
[3:40:10.520 --> 3:40:15.040]  of freedom they understand that we here at info wars are the ones who will sound
[3:40:15.040 --> 3:40:18.960]  the public alert will let the American people know exactly what you're right
[3:40:18.960 --> 3:40:22.240]  anytime you take over country you take over the trains and the telephones and
[3:40:22.240 --> 3:40:26.960]  and that's it they are literally they said they have to get us before they
[3:40:26.960 --> 3:40:30.880]  move which is not a fun position to be in you know what it's like Roger I mean
[3:40:30.880 --> 3:40:36.880]  folks need to know though this is a total war well Alex just the cost of the
[3:40:36.880 --> 3:40:42.320]  multi-million dollar harassment lawsuits against info wars and we get them
[3:40:42.320 --> 3:40:46.880]  thrown out because they're bogus and they refinance them the goal again I
[3:40:46.880 --> 3:40:49.800]  haven't talked about it yet we got them thrown out they followed more lives the
[3:40:49.800 --> 3:40:54.080]  same ones last week yeah yeah so but the point is it's it's a strategy of
[3:40:54.080 --> 3:40:58.840]  personal financial destruction they want to limit our ability to defend
[3:40:58.840 --> 3:41:02.640]  themselves I've been under federal investigation by the Mueller witch hunt
[3:41:02.640 --> 3:41:06.480]  for two years and before that I was under surveillance by the Obama
[3:41:06.480 --> 3:41:12.240]  administration for at least six months of 2016 and the cost is debilitating I
[3:41:12.240 --> 3:41:16.120]  mean I'm gonna have a very bleak Christmas unless folks go to stone
[3:41:16.120 --> 3:41:20.640]  defense fun calm and help me and thank God that I still have this platform here
[3:41:20.640 --> 3:41:24.480]  at info let's talk about that because Google only puts negative results at the
[3:41:24.480 --> 3:41:28.920]  top on me they have a link says I'm worth ten million dollars on you it's the
[3:41:28.920 --> 3:41:33.440]  same thing so we don't get support and I guess you sold all the equipment here
[3:41:33.440 --> 3:41:36.960]  and everything and wouldn't be worth that but the point is they're just lying
[3:41:36.960 --> 3:41:40.840]  they just literally I know you Roger we don't bet you about it but it's true I
[3:41:40.840 --> 3:41:45.280]  mean you're you're having trouble paying your bills I'm okay at this point people
[3:41:45.280 --> 3:41:49.320]  are supporting us but down the road I mean it's it's it's it's just it's
[3:41:49.320 --> 3:41:53.080]  unbelievable lies though because Google says something it's true and I love
[3:41:53.080 --> 3:41:55.680]  what Gohmert kept saying that we'll play go when we come back I'll play the
[3:41:55.680 --> 3:41:59.320]  Trump thing too kept saying you know what you don't get liability protection
[3:41:59.320 --> 3:42:03.040]  anymore well fact that in fact you're not living in the light you can't even see
[3:42:03.040 --> 3:42:10.520]  the light here it is you trust people that have stirred up a lot of hate and
[3:42:10.520 --> 3:42:17.160]  another good example and you don't you're so surrounded by liberality that
[3:42:17.160 --> 3:42:23.080]  hates conservatism hates people that really love our Constitution and the
[3:42:23.080 --> 3:42:27.760]  freedoms it's afforded people like you that you don't even recognize it it's
[3:42:27.760 --> 3:42:32.000]  like a blind man not even knowing what light looks like because you're
[3:42:32.000 --> 3:42:45.200]  surrounded by darkness Wow you hear that that was total veritas you come here
[3:42:45.200 --> 3:42:51.200]  America lets you do something like this and then you crap all over you kill the
[3:42:51.200 --> 3:42:56.160]  golden goose in the last few months in full wars has been escalating our sales
[3:42:56.160 --> 3:42:59.960]  to clear out inventory of many of our best-selling items and then I came up
[3:42:59.960 --> 3:43:03.080]  with the idea last week let's not just extend the sale of free shipping store
[3:43:03.080 --> 3:43:09.080]  wide 50 to 75% off double-patriot points let's extend that sale but also add a
[3:43:09.080 --> 3:43:14.400]  free gift with every order even if it's a tube of fluoride free colloidal silver
[3:43:14.400 --> 3:43:20.080]  iodine 4 to 5 super blue you'll get a free gift of a best-selling t-shirt while
[3:43:20.080 --> 3:43:23.720]  supplies last and what I mean by that is everyone will get a t-shirt but these
[3:43:23.720 --> 3:43:27.560]  are gonna be selling out so whatever you order that day they'll be the shirt of
[3:43:27.560 --> 3:43:31.240]  the day that's there until it sells out then there'll be another shirt that goes
[3:43:31.240 --> 3:43:35.160]  up for the next group of orders so in the next 12 days we are going to have
[3:43:35.160 --> 3:43:40.040]  beyond any other sale we've ever had so this is a loss leader we are losing
[3:43:40.040 --> 3:43:43.460]  money on this this is our biggest sale ever get your free gift your free
[3:43:43.460 --> 3:43:47.400]  shipping everything and don't fight the crowds in four store calm in four's
[3:43:47.400 --> 3:43:53.280]  life calm or triple 8253 3139 God bless you and thank you for your support we

[3:47:24.280 --> 3:47:29.440]  few minutes of info wars live with your truly every day man during the break we
[3:47:29.440 --> 3:47:33.440]  got a new article it's at handy.com this congressman was in the committee
[3:47:33.440 --> 3:47:38.560]  hearing yesterday this is insane but it's par for the course you know
[3:47:38.560 --> 3:47:42.280]  democrats want your second amendment well now they want your first amendment
[3:47:42.280 --> 3:47:47.120]  true colors california representative says he'd love to regulate speech but
[3:47:47.120 --> 3:47:51.680]  first amendment prevents him so it needs to be repealed california congressman
[3:47:51.680 --> 3:47:56.080]  Ted Liu he's moved to china raised eyebrows across washington wednesday
[3:47:56.080 --> 3:48:01.120]  bizarrely saying he loved quote loved to regulate the content of speech was
[3:48:01.120 --> 3:48:06.680]  prohibited from doing some of the first amendment this is on cnn ladies and
[3:48:06.680 --> 3:48:13.560]  gentlemen here it is the CEO of google sundar pichai testifying before your
[3:48:13.560 --> 3:48:18.360]  committee about a number of concerns you took an opportunity to push back on
[3:48:18.360 --> 3:48:22.000]  republican claims of bias in google searches in the middle of this year and
[3:48:22.000 --> 3:48:26.120]  you google republican steve's police you googled after that republican steve
[3:48:26.120 --> 3:48:29.640]  king to show that there were favorable stories including from conservative
[3:48:29.640 --> 3:48:33.320]  outlets about scolese negative coverage of king and you made the point
[3:48:33.320 --> 3:48:36.680]  essentially that's not because of a google algorithm it's because of what
[3:48:36.680 --> 3:48:40.880]  these members do and say I will say it was it was clever it caught some
[3:48:40.880 --> 3:48:46.080]  attention but I wonder have you thought that maybe you and other democrats have
[3:48:46.080 --> 3:48:51.080]  missed opportunities to use your time to press google ceo at a time when these
[3:48:51.080 --> 3:48:55.480]  large tech companies are struggling to manage content perpetuating conspiracy
[3:48:55.480 --> 3:48:59.720]  theories they're so vulnerable to outside interference isn't that a focus that
[3:48:59.720 --> 3:49:05.040]  could have been a missed opportunity so it's a very good point you make I would
[3:49:05.040 --> 3:49:08.600]  love if I could have more than five minutes to question witnesses
[3:49:08.600 --> 3:49:13.560]  unfortunately I don't get that opportunity however I would love to be
[3:49:13.560 --> 3:49:18.560]  able to regulate the content of speech the first amendment prevents me from
[3:49:18.560 --> 3:49:23.080]  doing so and that's simply a function of the first amendment but I think over a
[3:49:23.080 --> 3:49:27.760]  long run it's better that government does not regulate the content of speech I
[3:49:27.760 --> 3:49:32.800]  would urge these private sector companies to regulate it better themselves
[3:49:32.800 --> 3:49:37.320]  but it's really nothing that I believe government can do and so that's been my
[3:49:37.320 --> 3:49:42.840]  position all along all right governor or governor pardon me congressman I just I
[3:49:42.840 --> 3:49:48.960]  promoted you as you see congressman Ted Lou from Gallup that's not a promotion
[3:49:48.960 --> 3:49:51.960]  idiot it's a different branch of government state government it's an
[3:49:51.960 --> 3:49:56.720]  executive branch versus the legislative goddamn idiot lord I apologize I will not
[3:49:56.720 --> 3:50:01.080]  use your name in vain but this gives me a real problem so many levels I watched
[3:50:01.080 --> 3:50:05.520]  him from 20 feet away with Roger Stone you're staying in the committee and he
[3:50:05.520 --> 3:50:10.120]  acted like a mental patient talking to himself for hours I can't I couldn't
[3:50:10.120 --> 3:50:15.680]  quit looking at him like one talking to himself and notice they've given it to
[3:50:15.680 --> 3:50:18.160]  Google they've given us a them to the censorship claiming their private
[3:50:18.160 --> 3:50:22.320]  companies when they're really utilities using section 230 and then violent and
[3:50:22.320 --> 3:50:26.600]  law to do this but he tells you I'd love to regulate speech she's like what
[3:50:26.600 --> 3:50:30.680]  about conspiracy theories you know like when we show Hillary falling down on
[3:50:30.680 --> 3:50:34.600]  her face the national news says she didn't they call it a conspiracy even
[3:50:34.600 --> 3:50:38.240]  though we have the video or Jim Acosta grabs the microwave and knocks her arm
[3:50:38.240 --> 3:50:41.960]  down they say that's fake we show the raw video they're pissed so they say
[3:50:41.960 --> 3:50:48.240]  we're fake so he she's like we need to shut down our competition or people that
[3:50:48.240 --> 3:50:53.200]  point out we're liars he's like yes I'd love to shut down free speech but I
[3:50:53.200 --> 3:50:58.880]  can't but we have the corporations to do it I mean Roger I gotta be honest I
[3:50:58.880 --> 3:51:02.000]  thought the Republican side was a bunch of arrogant lawyers except for a few
[3:51:02.000 --> 3:51:08.040]  people like Gates and and Jordan and and and Louis Gohmert is a great guy but
[3:51:08.040 --> 3:51:12.600]  the Democrats they all even have a Hank Johnson clip we have time to play it I
[3:51:12.600 --> 3:51:17.240]  don't think they're playing with a full deck here brother you know Alex for a
[3:51:17.240 --> 3:51:20.560]  moment I thought that was a Saturday Night Live spoof I thought that couldn't
[3:51:20.560 --> 3:51:25.920]  possibly be serious but then I realized it was look CNN is a conspiracy theory
[3:51:25.920 --> 3:51:31.600]  a left-wing conspiracy theory these people I assume are just mentally ill
[3:51:31.600 --> 3:51:37.240]  Ted Lou is a danger to our society he told you right there blatantly openly
[3:51:37.240 --> 3:51:42.160]  he opposes the Constitution he just wants to silence us why because he can't
[3:51:42.160 --> 3:51:46.320]  win a debate with us because he fears honest and open debate then you had
[3:51:46.320 --> 3:51:50.640]  Steve Cohen what's with that haircut what do they call it a skull it that was
[3:51:50.640 --> 3:51:54.720]  one of the weirdest things I've ever seen no the Democrats on that panel are
[3:51:54.720 --> 3:52:02.480]  a group of corrupt kickback taking pals professional career politicians who
[3:52:02.480 --> 3:52:06.520]  have no principles whatsoever and as long as Google's willing to feed them big
[3:52:06.520 --> 3:52:11.280]  campaign contributions they're prepared to read whatever statements the Google
[3:52:11.280 --> 3:52:15.440]  lobbyists have written for Jerry Nadler's statement yesterday I have
[3:52:15.440 --> 3:52:20.000]  absolute stone cold proof was written by Google lobbyists and he just reads
[3:52:20.000 --> 3:52:24.800]  whatever they give him the questions that he answered all prescripted by
[3:52:24.800 --> 3:52:29.320]  Google lobbyists Jerry you're a fraud you're corrupted you've been bought and
[3:52:29.320 --> 3:52:32.800]  paid for it you need to step down you need to resign let's be very clear
[3:52:32.800 --> 3:52:37.000]  anything you have to say any questions you want to ask on any issue going
[3:52:37.000 --> 3:52:41.200]  forward the correct response for us would be resign you're corrupted you're
[3:52:41.200 --> 3:52:45.800]  paid for your your part of the problem step down that's the only answer that
[3:52:45.800 --> 3:52:51.720]  one can assume and then watching this these vermin these cockroaches run from
[3:52:51.720 --> 3:52:57.760]  you and I yesterday like children like like like like like scalded dogs it was
[3:52:57.760 --> 3:53:01.520]  really pathetic by the way you're coming to town Thursday you should get her
[3:53:01.520 --> 3:53:05.360]  earlier gab McGinnis is landing right now he'll be here for two days we need to
[3:53:05.360 --> 3:53:10.640]  get the power trio here everything is happening but Roger we have swallows
[3:53:10.640 --> 3:53:14.760]  well saying gun owners don't worry I'll nuke you to turn your guns in we have
[3:53:14.760 --> 3:53:18.760]  always other people is saying we'll just get rid of the first amendment if we
[3:53:18.760 --> 3:53:23.840]  can I mean these people are really disconnected I mean there's something
[3:53:23.840 --> 3:53:30.040]  wrong with them it's it's a liberalism is as in culture would say a mental
[3:53:30.040 --> 3:53:34.880]  disease I think it's becoming clearer and clear and anybody who watched that
[3:53:34.880 --> 3:53:40.920]  video yesterday of the president in the Oval Office standing tall impressing the
[3:53:40.920 --> 3:53:44.120]  point that he's prepared to shut down the government that's what it takes to
[3:53:44.120 --> 3:53:48.400]  secure our borders that he's going to repel these caravans he's not going to
[3:53:48.400 --> 3:53:56.400]  let drug-addled foreigners criminals into the country ad nauseam but then
[3:53:56.400 --> 3:54:00.880]  watching CNN you have to assume they saw a different video than we saw the
[3:54:00.880 --> 3:54:05.160]  devil here's a here's a club of that right now here it is we can agree on is
[3:54:05.160 --> 3:54:08.840]  we shouldn't shut down the government over a dispute and you want to shut it
[3:54:08.840 --> 3:54:12.640]  down you keep talking about the last time Chuck you shut it down no no no and
[3:54:12.640 --> 3:54:16.640]  then you open it up very quickly and I don't want to do what you did 20 times
[3:54:16.640 --> 3:54:20.120]  you have called for I will shut down the government if I don't get my will
[3:54:20.120 --> 3:54:23.240]  none of us have you want to know something you said okay you want to put
[3:54:23.240 --> 3:54:28.720]  that I'll take it okay you know what I'll say yes if we don't get what we want
[3:54:28.720 --> 3:54:32.400]  one way or the other whether it's through you through a military through
[3:54:32.400 --> 3:54:37.160]  anything you want to call I will shut down the government and I am proud and
[3:54:37.160 --> 3:54:41.680]  I'm sorry I am proud to shut down the government for border security check
[3:54:41.680 --> 3:54:46.280]  because the people of this country don't want criminals and people that have
