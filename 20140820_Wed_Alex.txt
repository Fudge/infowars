[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:20.880]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.880 --> 00:31.280]  welcome to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight on this Wednesday August 20th 2014
[00:31.280 --> 00:35.760]  I'll be your host today we have an exciting show coming up besides the
[00:35.760 --> 00:39.000]  Info Wars reporters in Ferguson Missouri that are going to be joining us we're
[00:39.000 --> 00:44.280]  also going to be joined live in studio by author Thompson and he's the CEO of the
[00:44.280 --> 00:49.360]  John Birch Society he's in the area promoting his new book called
[00:49.360 --> 00:54.120]  international merger by foreign entanglements that's exactly what is
[00:54.120 --> 00:58.440]  happening in the world they're creating these regional trade zones just like we
[00:58.440 --> 01:03.240]  saw with NAFTA like we see with the EU and now they're creating the trans
[01:03.240 --> 01:08.360]  Pacific partnership joining these regional trade agreements together and
[01:08.360 --> 01:11.840]  of course the people who are controlling this country people like
[01:11.840 --> 01:16.400]  Petraeus are saying you know what comes after America well that's easy North
[01:16.400 --> 01:21.840]  America and he even references the North American trade union so they see this as
[01:21.840 --> 01:26.480]  an accomplished fact while we're just starting to realize many of us and the
[01:26.480 --> 01:30.680]  public are starting to see the consequences of the North American trade
[01:30.680 --> 01:34.840]  union as we see these open borders as people like Nancy Pelosi said we just
[01:34.840 --> 01:38.240]  happen to have this border with these these multiple communities are separated
[01:38.240 --> 01:41.280]  by this border the border doesn't really mean anything essentially is what she
[01:41.280 --> 01:47.160]  was saying as we see the consequences of this and start to push back against it
[01:47.160 --> 01:50.280]  many people in the public who have not been following it for decades like the
[01:50.280 --> 01:54.080]  John Birch Society they're working on the next stage of this they're working on
[01:54.080 --> 01:58.240]  taking these regional trading groups and merging them together so that's the way
[01:58.240 --> 02:02.320]  that they come up with a globalist regime is through these trade agreements
[02:02.320 --> 02:05.680]  I'm very anxious to talk to him about that we also have news about a geo
[02:05.680 --> 02:10.360]  engineering climate climate engineering conference that is going on in Berlin as
[02:10.360 --> 02:16.560]  we speak this week ending tomorrow they have a conference on how they can change
[02:16.560 --> 02:22.120]  the climate now we've talked about chemtrails Alex had a geoengineering
[02:22.120 --> 02:26.320]  special report just last week we're going to look at a couple of the papers
[02:26.320 --> 02:29.720]  that are going to be presented at this conference that are being presented one
[02:29.720 --> 02:36.080]  of them today very interesting revelation of what they're up to we're also going to
[02:36.080 --> 02:40.720]  look more in-depth at the Pentagon's 1033 program the consequences of that
[02:40.720 --> 02:45.360]  that's the program where they give the equipment to all these local police
[02:45.360 --> 02:49.720]  departments that's what's fundamentally behind this militarization of the police
[02:49.720 --> 02:53.680]  and as you're looking at this right now we've got a article this up on info
[02:53.680 --> 02:59.360]  wars.com this cop who's running around pointing guns in people's faces I mean
[02:59.360 --> 03:03.040]  he's like some kind of a panicked animal they're just running around with a gun
[03:03.040 --> 03:07.960]  in people's faces and when they ask him what he's doing all he says is the F
[03:07.960 --> 03:11.080]  word you know I'm going to blow your effing head off and when they ask him
[03:11.080 --> 03:17.560]  his name he says you know it basically repeats that very very serious to see
[03:17.560 --> 03:23.280]  this kind of thing happening this kind of unprofessional provocative behavior
[03:23.280 --> 03:28.000]  anybody that's handled a gun knows that you don't point it at somebody you don't
[03:28.000 --> 03:32.200]  plan to shoot that's a very serious thing but that's becoming standard
[03:32.200 --> 03:36.280]  operating procedure right now where's that coming from well it's being driven
[03:36.280 --> 03:40.680]  by these programs where they give this equipment out to people get them all
[03:40.680 --> 03:45.640]  hyped up it's kind of like when you have a homeschool as we were doing that
[03:45.640 --> 03:49.160]  we're looking at the curriculum what were we to teach if we're going to pass
[03:49.160 --> 03:54.640]  the test they can try to drive what you teach in school by setting up the test
[03:54.640 --> 03:58.520]  they don't have to dictate the curriculum to you directly they can set it up by
[03:58.520 --> 04:02.960]  setting some standards that you have to get your kids to follow through that's
[04:02.960 --> 04:07.240]  the same thing they're doing with the police as they train them in this
[04:07.240 --> 04:11.680]  militarized program one aspect that you probably don't realize is that part of
[04:11.680 --> 04:17.000]  the military surplus program involved giving equipment to firefighters that
[04:17.000 --> 04:20.480]  was something that went on for several decades before they ever started giving
[04:20.480 --> 04:24.880]  it to the police departments that went back to right after World War two they
[04:24.880 --> 04:29.320]  recently tried to shut that down there was a massive pushback against that we're
[04:29.320 --> 04:34.840]  going to talk about that and we have news about the Kardashians that's right
[04:34.840 --> 04:37.800]  right here on info wars we're going to cover some stuff about the Kardashians
[04:37.800 --> 04:41.560]  they wanted to get into Plum Island so we're going to talk about that DARPA's
[04:41.560 --> 04:49.000]  got a new bid out $150,000 if you can track the spread of chicken gunia fever
[04:49.000 --> 04:59.280]  and also new vaccines on the horizon stay with us we'll be right back another
[04:59.280 --> 05:03.280]  major health threat this one in Toledo Ohio where everybody in the entire city

[08:19.040 --> 08:27.200]  welcome to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight on this Wednesday August 20th
[08:27.200 --> 08:33.920]  2014 we're going to be having a conversation with Arthur Thompson the
[08:33.920 --> 08:37.800]  CEO of the John Birch Society he's going to be joining us live in studio in the
[08:37.800 --> 08:41.480]  third hour he's got a new book out international merger by foreign
[08:41.480 --> 08:45.000]  entanglements it's exactly as I point out the last segment what is happening
[08:45.000 --> 08:49.680]  they create these regional trade groups and now as we see the effects 20 years
[08:49.680 --> 08:55.120]  on into NAFTA they're working on creating the next step and that is to
[08:55.120 --> 09:01.840]  combine NAFTA the North American Union combine that with the European Union and
[09:01.840 --> 09:05.800]  also combine the North American Union with the Asian trade groups that's the
[09:05.800 --> 09:09.440]  way they're going to get a globalist control through the corporations giving
[09:09.440 --> 09:13.880]  them powers that are above what government has we've also got some
[09:13.880 --> 09:18.320]  breaking news about a geoengineering conference that's going on in Berlin
[09:18.320 --> 09:22.640]  right now ends tomorrow there's going to be a couple of interesting papers we're
[09:22.640 --> 09:26.320]  going to go over there of course Alex Jones had a geoengineering special report
[09:26.320 --> 09:31.360]  last week and we're going to look at what they're up to and actually one of
[09:31.360 --> 09:35.640]  these papers one of the scientists has a little bit of problem with what they're
[09:35.640 --> 09:38.760]  planning to do what we would say they're already doing you know that's the
[09:38.760 --> 09:43.200]  sort of thing that you see happening with the surveillance state for many
[09:43.200 --> 09:46.800]  years we told you what they were doing they pretended they weren't doing it
[09:46.800 --> 09:51.240]  right up until the Snowden documents came out of course ahead of the NSA was
[09:51.240 --> 09:55.240]  saying oh no no we're not spying on anybody and and of course the senator
[09:55.240 --> 09:59.880]  asked him a question knew that they were he had seen the classified documents he
[09:59.880 --> 10:03.680]  knew he was lying that's why he was trying to get him to tell the truth
[10:03.680 --> 10:06.800]  under oath but they don't do that either so what they do is they do these things
[10:06.800 --> 10:11.640]  they do it secretly when you talk about it they say your conspiracy theorist you
[10:11.640 --> 10:14.680]  know these people Alex Jones the John Burt society all these guys are just
[10:14.680 --> 10:18.320]  into conspiracies we have an interesting clip that we're going to play you to to
[10:18.320 --> 10:24.560]  put things into perspective going back to a Larry McDonald appearance on CNN
[10:24.560 --> 10:29.280]  Crossfire with Pat Buchanan and Tom Braden you may not know Tom Braden but
[10:29.280 --> 10:33.960]  he was someone who is very instrumental in the creation of the CIA he was someone
[10:33.960 --> 10:38.280]  who created Operation Mockingbird and he was somebody who had a very large
[10:38.280 --> 10:42.800]  presence in the media so it's an interesting three three-way conversation
[10:42.800 --> 10:47.280]  there between those guys just before Larry McDonald who was a congressman and
[10:47.280 --> 10:51.440]  also a past president of the John Burt society we're going to play some excerpts
[10:51.440 --> 10:55.880]  of that when we talk to Arthur Thompson we're also going to be going to our
[10:55.880 --> 10:59.560]  Info Wars reporters in Ferguson, Missouri we're going to look more in-depth at this
[10:59.560 --> 11:03.960]  Pentagon 1033 program which is militarizing our local police departments
[11:03.960 --> 11:07.600]  you know that was something else of the John Burt society for years talked
[11:07.600 --> 11:12.520]  about decades ago they were talking about local control of the police and how
[11:12.520 --> 11:17.720]  important it was that that not turn into federal control well now it's actually
[11:17.720 --> 11:22.160]  moving beyond that we've got the UN talking about how they want to
[11:22.160 --> 11:25.840]  essentially set up standards for the way the police are going to interact with
[11:25.840 --> 11:29.520]  people I think they need to be controlled locally we need to find some
[11:29.520 --> 11:33.600]  method to control the police frankly I think with the federal involvement they
[11:33.600 --> 11:38.040]  have gone out of control so we're going to look at that program and there's
[11:38.040 --> 11:41.320]  something that I don't think many of you have heard about it something that was
[11:41.320 --> 11:46.680]  only covered by local stations when it first came out back in June the Pentagon
[11:46.680 --> 11:51.400]  momentarily said that they were going to stop a program of giving military
[11:51.400 --> 11:55.600]  surplus hardware to fire departments this is a program that had been in effect
[11:55.600 --> 11:59.840]  since the 1950s shortly after war two ended and they started bringing back
[11:59.840 --> 12:04.640]  surplus equipment they started giving it to fire departments a long time before
[12:04.640 --> 12:06.920]  they started giving it to police departments they didn't start the
[12:06.920 --> 12:12.080]  police program until the mid 90s so for 40 years they were giving surplus
[12:12.080 --> 12:17.000]  equipment to small fire departments rule fire departments that had to deal with
[12:17.000 --> 12:21.720]  massive wildfires but had a very small population base could not afford to get
[12:21.720 --> 12:24.960]  this equipment it was a very useful very productive thing to do with that
[12:24.960 --> 12:28.440]  equipment they decided they were going to stop that abruptly at the end of June
[12:28.440 --> 12:33.320]  there was a major backlash because you know firemen don't take things setting
[12:33.320 --> 12:36.880]  down they get very active about things so they got in touch with their
[12:36.880 --> 12:40.040]  congressmen with their senators they pushed that back before about three
[12:40.040 --> 12:44.800]  weeks people were talking about this program how it had existed how necessary
[12:44.800 --> 12:49.600]  and vital it was how so many of the fires were put out by local people but
[12:49.600 --> 12:56.320]  the Pentagon wants to militarize the police and do it so quickly that they
[12:56.320 --> 13:00.600]  even wanted to cut this little bit of equipment that they were giving to
[13:00.600 --> 13:04.360]  fire stations so we're going to talk about that watch in that program and we
[13:04.360 --> 13:08.880]  also have Kardashian news they tried to get on to Plum Island and they were
[13:08.880 --> 13:14.080]  told no sorry it's kind of secretive here we're also going to talk about a new
[13:14.080 --> 13:19.600]  DARPA contract putting an award out $150,000 for people who can predict how
[13:19.600 --> 13:24.920]  the chicken gunia fever is going to move across the United States they want to
[13:24.920 --> 13:29.760]  track this as they would track a pandemic anytime DARPA gets involved in
[13:29.760 --> 13:34.120]  something you need to watch it carefully so we're going to talk about the new
[13:34.120 --> 13:38.120]  chicken gunia vaccine it's a new mechanism it's a very different way
[13:38.120 --> 13:43.560]  that they've got of trying to control the disease and it also applies to the
[13:43.560 --> 13:46.360]  new Ebola vaccine so we're going to talk about that we're going to talk about
[13:46.360 --> 13:50.800]  Plum Island we're going to talk about some diseases that are put out by a
[13:50.800 --> 13:56.560]  tick-borne that tick vector to put this out so we've got some
[13:56.560 --> 14:02.080]  interesting news on that front but the top story is what's going on in Ferguson
[14:02.080 --> 14:05.320]  right now and Alex is going to be joining us in a few minutes to talk
[14:05.320 --> 14:10.480]  about this because last night our reporters got some amazing footage we
[14:10.480 --> 14:15.680]  have an article up on info wars right now about a Ferguson cop who is pointing
[14:15.680 --> 14:19.920]  a gun at journalists and saying I'm going to kill you he's pointing the gun
[14:19.920 --> 14:23.400]  right in their face and he keeps doing this and he's just kind of walking
[14:23.400 --> 14:26.520]  around the crowd if you're watching as you can see the b-roll there I don't
[14:26.520 --> 14:29.360]  know how much of this we can play guys can we play some of this or is it all
[14:29.360 --> 14:34.160]  profanity it's all perfect there's too much okay we're gonna have a blue version
[14:34.160 --> 14:38.120]  for you but right now it's I'll give you the gist of it if you're listening on
[14:38.120 --> 14:42.240]  the radio this is Paul Joseph Watson's article he said shocking footage out of
[14:42.240 --> 14:45.200]  Ferguson Missouri shows a police officer pointing his gun directly at
[14:45.200 --> 14:51.760]  protesters and the press while remarking I'm going to effing kill you and the
[14:51.760 --> 14:55.760]  journalist says oh he's got his gun raised the gun raised and Joe Biggs
[14:55.760 --> 15:00.200]  was standing right there and said his gun is pointed and the journalist says
[15:00.200 --> 15:04.920]  my hands are up bro my hands are up and the cop says I'm going to effing kill
[15:04.920 --> 15:08.880]  you get back get back he goes you're gonna kill him says another individual
[15:08.880 --> 15:13.280]  did he just threaten to kill me and then when they ask the cop for his name he
[15:13.280 --> 15:19.400]  says go eff yourself and so that's now become a hashtag on Twitter a hashtag
[15:19.400 --> 15:24.000]  officer go eff yourself they spell it out and we've got a couple of tweets here
[15:24.000 --> 15:28.360]  from Joe Biggs he said I witnessed a cop stick his M4 in the journalist's face
[15:28.360 --> 15:31.880]  and say I'll effing kill you a female officer had to pull him out of the
[15:31.880 --> 15:37.200]  young man's face Mikhail Thelan tweeted that he had three riot cops freaking out
[15:37.200 --> 15:41.600]  and pointing shotguns at him when he got isolated behind a building after
[15:41.600 --> 15:46.480]  everything started happening well this is something that is very new I can
[15:46.480 --> 15:50.600]  remember it's probably been about six years ago when we adopted my daughter
[15:50.600 --> 15:56.480]  from China and when we were in a it was a massive crowded retail street I mean it
[15:56.480 --> 16:00.240]  was totally packed and you can't imagine it unless you've been to China or let's
[16:00.240 --> 16:03.440]  say New York on St. Patrick's Day parade I mean it's that kind of a crowd
[16:03.440 --> 16:09.160]  shoulder-to-shoulder everybody is packed they pulled up in an armored vehicle and
[16:09.160 --> 16:13.000]  this security guard gets out he's got armor he's got a helmet kind of like
[16:13.000 --> 16:18.000]  what you see the police wearing now and a shotgun and he levels the shotgun he
[16:18.000 --> 16:21.760]  doesn't have a muzzle up he doesn't have a muzzle down he points it at the crowd
[16:21.760 --> 16:27.480]  shotgun and we were right there and I could not believe they would be that
[16:27.480 --> 16:33.040]  irresponsible I said I've never seen anything like this and of course that
[16:33.040 --> 16:36.880]  is what's become standard operating procedure for our police now that's been
[16:36.880 --> 16:41.080]  happening all week joining us now is Alex Jones to comment on this Alex
[16:41.080 --> 16:45.240]  that's right David as I announced yesterday in the third hour on air I've
[16:45.240 --> 16:52.600]  gotten so upset by all of this that when I start having a literal anger issues
[16:52.600 --> 16:56.680]  that's not fake on air when I'm blowing up folks but that's going on behind the
[16:56.680 --> 17:02.280]  scenes as well because I'm so upset that I decided to just take a day off and get
[17:02.280 --> 17:07.080]  a lot of a different Aaron's issues completed they're more administrative
[17:07.080 --> 17:11.240]  around the office of the house and then the reason I raise this personal point
[17:11.240 --> 17:20.000]  is it shows how serious all of this is that that never in almost 20 years on
[17:20.000 --> 17:25.760]  air never have I had to actually just take myself off air even though I wasn't
[17:25.760 --> 17:30.200]  making that big of a fool myself on air I was just getting so physically upset
[17:30.200 --> 17:34.480]  and disgusted that there's no point in just getting on air and venting a bunch
[17:34.480 --> 17:39.960]  of anger and the lesson out of that is I'm on one extreme getting so angry
[17:39.960 --> 17:44.120]  about things other people are on the other extreme not caring or thinking
[17:44.120 --> 17:49.120]  they don't have any power and then I watch the live streams last night this
[17:49.120 --> 17:54.960]  is not a fake reality TV show this is the real world and the end of our country
[17:54.960 --> 17:58.440]  basically collapsing we're gonna skip this network break and I'm gonna be
[17:58.440 --> 18:03.200]  gone by the bottom of the hour and heard over to David Knight but the reason I
[18:03.200 --> 18:08.880]  prefaced all of this with my own personal feelings on the subject is this is
[18:08.880 --> 18:14.800]  how a country dies this is how tyranny comes in by increment my success of
[18:14.800 --> 18:20.480]  approximation and then finally they're not taking baby steps they're not taking
[18:20.480 --> 18:26.880]  giant leaps they are jumping light years ahead in destroying our republic
[18:26.880 --> 18:33.120]  right in front of us and the police the looters the demonstrators the media the
[18:33.120 --> 18:39.240]  American people were all being manipulated by very sophisticated
[18:39.240 --> 18:44.960]  psyops so I wanted to take off today so that last night and this morning I could
[18:44.960 --> 18:50.240]  really just sit back read the news take my time trying to figure out what's
[18:50.240 --> 18:58.480]  going on exactly and to really try to gauge the larger situation and stepping
[18:58.480 --> 19:05.600]  back and watching the HD reports filed at info wars.com and then they're on the
[19:05.600 --> 19:13.800]  YouTube channel and on prisonplanet.tv it is just so over the top incredible the
[19:13.800 --> 19:22.080]  picture that has emerged clearly now several weeks into this Ferguson crisis
[19:22.080 --> 19:30.240]  the feds have been there since day one the feds are undoubtedly manipulating
[19:30.240 --> 19:36.800]  this through CNN MSNBC the new black Panther Party useful idiots and the
[19:36.800 --> 19:41.160]  Ford Foundation type operatives that are on the ground there we're gonna get
[19:41.160 --> 19:45.840]  some shocking evidence of that here in just a moment the police are clearly
[19:45.840 --> 19:50.840]  being given orders to brutalize the press and to treat the press with hatred
[19:50.840 --> 19:57.400]  and to assault the press and the threat to kill the press in fact I may just have
[19:57.400 --> 20:01.200]  to order the reporters back because they've got a lot of courage and they
[20:01.200 --> 20:04.680]  keep going up to the very front lines where reporters are being arrested left
[20:04.680 --> 20:08.960]  and right in front of them and brutalized for no reason our guys are now
[20:08.960 --> 20:16.280]  there standing there shooting HD video as the cops sticks the M4 M16 variant to
[20:16.280 --> 20:22.320]  the chest of reporters and points at them as well and says I will effing kill
[20:22.320 --> 20:28.640]  you with an arrogant belligerent not that doesn't have a mask on anything no
[20:28.640 --> 20:32.760]  one's arguing with them no one's telling him he's a piece of crap no one is
[20:32.760 --> 20:38.360]  antagonizing them they are targeting the press and in the Joe Biggs video that
[20:38.360 --> 20:44.080]  Marcos Morales uploaded the middle of the night last night police arresting
[20:44.080 --> 20:47.840]  journalists in Ferguson Missouri that's the headline and I sat here this
[20:47.840 --> 20:53.720]  morning watching it I cannot figure out a way to describe what is in this five
[20:53.720 --> 20:58.440]  minute video this video and there's a whole bunch of them I can't quit
[20:58.440 --> 21:03.560]  watching because as an investigator has been doing this for 20 years that knows
[21:03.560 --> 21:07.560]  how provocateurs work who's gone up against them scores of times I've had
[21:07.560 --> 21:12.600]  the army try to set fires in Florida and blaming on me I have been chased
[21:12.600 --> 21:15.640]  through swamps by doom buggies I mean I'm just telling people that's in police
[21:15.640 --> 21:19.920]  they do I've dealt with this over and over again I've dealt with this trying to
[21:19.920 --> 21:23.400]  build a memorial church in Waco I've dealt with the Klan threatened to kill me
[21:23.400 --> 21:29.080]  and find it out their federal agents and informants so when I tell people
[21:29.080 --> 21:34.760]  something I'm not I'm going off experience we saw the feds dressed up
[21:34.760 --> 21:41.440]  like anarchist also running anarchist under them in Seattle in 99 at WTO we've
[21:41.440 --> 21:47.920]  caught them in Ottawa Canada at the G20 we've caught them in Pittsburgh it is so
[21:47.920 --> 21:52.320]  criminal to watch the police run a false flag I've now analyzed these videos and
[21:52.320 --> 21:56.680]  in the same video that's on the YouTube channel I don't even think we've got on
[21:56.680 --> 22:01.320]  the website yet titled police arresting journalist in Ferguson I cannot even
[22:01.320 --> 22:04.840]  come up with a proper headline for this video because the guys are filing this
[22:04.840 --> 22:11.560]  report and it's narrated by Biggs but he just they just glaze over the cop
[22:11.560 --> 22:15.240]  pointing a gun at him and threatening to kill him they I'm not saying that's bad
[22:15.240 --> 22:18.800]  they glaze over it they glaze over all these other reporters being brutalized
[22:18.800 --> 22:23.760]  attacked and then right there Biggs clearly completed the mission and
[22:23.760 --> 22:32.280]  discovered a cache of all-off cocktails deployed in an area strategically and I've
[22:32.280 --> 22:36.480]  seen this over and over again by the feds guaranteed he goes to all the police
[22:36.480 --> 22:41.360]  tells them where it's at they look at him and then are clearly in the know and
[22:41.360 --> 22:46.320]  say get out of here and do nothing and then you see the press conference and
[22:46.320 --> 22:49.520]  the gun and it's been the same all-off cocktail that they had the press
[22:49.520 --> 22:56.000]  conference two nights ago I'm here to tell you looking at these videos that
[22:56.000 --> 23:01.440]  the evidence is all there we now know this may have been staged from the very
[23:01.440 --> 23:09.620]  beginning of this this whole thing is a sigh of just like the IS
[23:09.620 --> 23:14.560]  terrorists chopping the US reporters head off that's a real reporter that's
[23:14.560 --> 23:19.480]  probably a real beheading ISIS is real IS is real it's called Al Qaeda and
[23:19.480 --> 23:24.280]  Iraq it was allowed and armed by our filthy degenerate wicked globalist
[23:24.280 --> 23:28.360]  occupied government to attack Syria and they're on the news this morning
[23:28.360 --> 23:34.860]  separately we're just living a sigh of saying we've got to go back into Syria
[23:34.860 --> 23:40.760]  IS is using Eastern Syria to go into Western Iraq when our government set
[23:40.760 --> 23:45.220]  them up and turned them loose it's like throwing a baby with a cut sonics back
[23:45.220 --> 23:50.240]  into a pool of starving piranhas and it's saying oh my god we've got to do
[23:50.240 --> 23:54.240]  something for the baby I mean that you can see the problem reaction solution
[23:54.240 --> 24:00.200]  and just like the cops have been caught under fed control in every major event
[24:00.200 --> 24:04.000]  provocaturing to give them the fake moral I ground there's that famous video
[24:04.000 --> 24:08.440]  from five years ago where the government even did an investigation the RCMP had to
[24:08.440 --> 24:14.400]  admit that they did it they had huge you know cops in the anarchist garb
[24:14.400 --> 24:20.840]  beating up other cops and you could tell that it was about 95% fake they were
[24:20.840 --> 24:24.240]  actually hit them pretty hard but the cops were winking and they were all
[24:24.240 --> 24:28.520]  wearing the same boots and they got caught that was in the Toronto Star you
[24:28.520 --> 24:33.760]  got caught they did provocaturing at the G20 in London and then a guy delivering
[24:33.760 --> 24:39.400]  newspapers and chewing gum to the corner store
[24:39.400 --> 24:45.320]  showed him his ID said you know I'm I'm delivering food into the conference area
[24:45.320 --> 24:49.560]  into one of the gift shops and they just beat his brains out in front of
[24:49.560 --> 24:53.320]  everybody and then said that he had assaulted the police until a video got
[24:53.320 --> 24:57.680]  released and they just beat his brains out cold blooded murder and so what
[24:57.680 --> 25:02.120]  you've got is cold-blooded murderers being hired for the police department's
[25:02.120 --> 25:08.000]  cold-blooded police and unstable mental patients who basically shouldn't have a
[25:08.000 --> 25:12.960]  job pushing a mob are being put in and promoted to create this culture now of
[25:12.960 --> 25:18.440]  a full conversion of the police into a vicious hateful occupying army who are
[25:18.440 --> 25:22.480]  targeting the media on purpose now folks we can keep more than one
[25:22.480 --> 25:26.960]  fought our minds at the same time we can chew bubble gum and and and and you
[25:26.960 --> 25:32.960]  know trim the hedges or walk and chew bubble gum it doesn't mean the thugs are
[25:32.960 --> 25:36.880]  good it doesn't mean the looters are good we're there exposing them and
[25:36.880 --> 25:40.920]  reporting on them throwing rocks at the police and they're not being arrested
[25:40.920 --> 25:45.800]  when they do it we have video of them throwing rocks at police I'm explain
[25:45.800 --> 25:49.960]  this in the same area they're brutalizing journalists and targeting them
[25:49.960 --> 25:55.360]  with a hatred as if journalists are all convicted child molesters the journalists
[25:55.360 --> 26:00.320]  are professional in almost every case while they're being assaulted by out of
[26:00.320 --> 26:03.520]  control police attacking the First Amendment attacking all of our freedoms
[26:03.520 --> 26:10.240]  this is a vomitus then you expand it from that to people throwing bricks at
[26:10.240 --> 26:15.080]  the police and the cops stand there like they're ready for it and just let it
[26:15.080 --> 26:19.240]  bounce off their body armor and then you got mall off cocktails cashed right over
[26:19.240 --> 26:24.840]  by an area by the police bigs discovers them goes to them and the cops look like
[26:24.840 --> 26:28.920]  at them an adrenaline rush like they've just been caught in something so they're
[26:28.920 --> 26:33.640]  clearly working with the new black panther people to start things up they
[26:33.640 --> 26:37.640]  are clearly working with other Justice Department provocateurs that are on the
[26:37.640 --> 26:41.000]  ground I don't think the police themselves are involved but they know
[26:41.000 --> 26:45.720]  they're not stupid this is disgusting and this whole Ferguson thing is a
[26:45.720 --> 26:51.160]  laboratory to shoot HD video and reports to train departments all over the
[26:51.160 --> 26:55.480]  country the feds do the training they send in the armored vehicles they give
[26:55.480 --> 26:59.920]  the state the money they give them the Army manuals to point guns at people
[26:59.920 --> 27:03.800]  and to shoot protesters in the future lethally to stop peaceful protesters as
[27:03.800 --> 27:09.800]  a Psyop that's in the new Army manual this is all earth shaking of course
[27:09.800 --> 27:14.520]  they'll throw a mall off cocktails at themselves to stir this up and to give
[27:14.520 --> 27:19.600]  the police state the moral high ground if they'll have official manuals April of
[27:19.600 --> 27:25.000]  this year released last Friday saying they will kill in a crowd of peaceful
[27:25.000 --> 27:30.120]  demonstrators they will shoot for the chest the testicles the spine the heart
[27:30.120 --> 27:33.360]  depending on if they want to wound someone to scare the crowd or if they
[27:33.360 --> 27:39.920]  want to kill and it gives authorization not in law but in doctrine to murder
[27:39.920 --> 27:45.240]  Americans in mass and they will do this when the collapse cops and when cities
[27:45.240 --> 27:50.240]  are burning it will be legitimate when the military goes out there and mows
[27:50.240 --> 27:55.800]  down looters but remember who lit the fuse remember who started the whole
[27:55.800 --> 27:59.880]  thing to where they will make us the middle class
[27:59.880 --> 28:06.320]  big for martial law big them to save us and when the police fail and when they
[28:06.320 --> 28:13.120]  fall then they're gonna bring in the UN troops and I was told this by FBI agents
[28:13.120 --> 28:19.920]  and Army generals and Air Force generals and I was told this by CIA people
[28:19.920 --> 28:27.160]  all told me the same thing from the time that I was a little kid right up until
[28:27.160 --> 28:32.880]  my 19 years on air talking to these people on air Marine Corps colonels
[28:32.880 --> 28:37.120]  you name it you've heard them all and I'm telling you I was a little kid
[28:37.120 --> 28:43.240]  listening to FBI people my family knew and John Berger's my family knew and
[28:43.240 --> 28:48.840]  people that worked in secret operations so my family all knew about this and
[28:48.840 --> 28:53.040]  said this was the plan of the globalist to bring America down and folks we are
[28:53.040 --> 29:01.640]  actually beginning to see it right now unfold in front of everyone's face now
[29:01.640 --> 29:05.040]  if they fail if we expose this and they back off that's good people say oh we're
[29:05.040 --> 29:09.280]  the martial law you're seeing martial law they did tested when they are
[29:09.280 --> 29:13.800]  targeting reporters we now have it on video while people throw rocks at the
[29:13.800 --> 29:20.480]  cops okay I'm gonna explain that again they are clearly being told to stand
[29:20.480 --> 29:25.080]  down while this goes on I'm gonna come back and finish up and throw the baton
[29:25.080 --> 29:28.840]  to David Knight the reporters are coming up the next hour but we've got to go
[29:28.840 --> 29:32.600]  over all these videos and name these and I'm not knocking the crew for not giving
[29:32.600 --> 29:36.640]  out a powerful name I don't know how you call with something powerful enough to
[29:36.640 --> 29:41.000]  describe what's on this video evidence of provocatory the police threatening to
[29:41.000 --> 29:44.320]  kill people we'll play that clip when we come back threatening to shoot
[29:44.320 --> 29:48.620]  journalist threatening to murder them I will quote kill you premeditated we're

[33:51.560 --> 34:17.160]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight in studio we were just
[34:17.160 --> 34:21.880]  talking to Alex Jones and it's an absolutely amazing that we would have
[34:21.880 --> 34:24.840]  to be concerned enough to consider bringing back our journalists why
[34:24.840 --> 34:29.400]  because they're threatened by the police because it's the police that are
[34:29.400 --> 34:34.480]  pointing guns in journalists faces threatening to kill them these kinds of
[34:34.480 --> 34:38.520]  rules of engagement are totally out of control not only is it unprofessional
[34:38.520 --> 34:42.680]  but it's amazingly provocative and dangerous to see the police doing this
[34:42.680 --> 34:47.680]  but of course we just had a couple of days ago a document written in April of
[34:47.680 --> 34:51.680]  this year the Paul Joseph Watson published an article showing that they
[34:51.680 --> 34:58.840]  are gaming for shooting unarmed protesters exactly what we saw the
[34:58.840 --> 35:01.480]  first couple of nights that our reporters were in Ferguson, Missouri if
[35:01.480 --> 35:05.120]  you remember I think we're the only ones to have reported it we actually showed
[35:05.120 --> 35:09.560]  video of the police not only leveling their guns but having their sniper
[35:09.560 --> 35:15.360]  rifles trained on individuals and lighting them up with the laser sights on
[35:15.360 --> 35:20.680]  their rifles clearly showing that they had their sniper rifles pointed at these
[35:20.680 --> 35:25.480]  people and were ready to fire on them that is exactly what they are planning
[35:25.480 --> 35:30.200]  to do in this document they talk about taking out the leaders of peaceful
[35:30.200 --> 35:34.800]  protests eliminating those guys with snipers and that's what we saw a year
[35:34.800 --> 35:39.920]  ago a document was leaked about the from the FBI saying that they were looking
[35:39.920 --> 35:45.880]  at using suppressed sniper fire to take out the leaders of the occupy movement
[35:45.880 --> 35:50.880]  and it's absolutely amazing to see that Alex we had a little bit of phone
[35:50.880 --> 35:55.880]  problem I think you're back with us now go ahead yes I just want to be clear
[35:55.880 --> 36:00.960]  here that there is an organized doctrine to kill reporters and kill the leaders
[36:00.960 --> 36:05.880]  of peaceful demonstrations and movements they want to set the precedent on
[36:05.880 --> 36:11.880]  intercity people and folks that have been demonized for whatever reason so
[36:11.880 --> 36:16.080]  first they sell the police state on Muslims then they sell it for intercity
[36:16.080 --> 36:20.600]  blacks the final enemy and all the training and all the preparations is
[36:20.600 --> 36:26.400]  gun owners and everyone's bill of rights everyone's constitution but if people
[36:26.400 --> 36:30.920]  want to put it in racial terms it is the war on white people that members of the
[36:30.920 --> 36:36.480]  Senate in the House have talked about the open race war pimping by MSNBC CNN and
[36:36.480 --> 36:41.480]  others run directly by the Justice Department and we have massive evidence
[36:41.480 --> 36:48.520]  in the video retitled Ferguson police threatened to kill journalists we have
[36:48.520 --> 36:53.280]  the video of them threatening to kill the journalist that is inside that six
[36:53.280 --> 36:57.880]  minute video we have big discovering them all off cocktails and trying to tell
[36:57.880 --> 37:04.400]  police and nothing being done we have just massive evidence of sitting back
[37:04.400 --> 37:08.600]  and looking at it it's incredible now we haven't played the clip yet of the
[37:08.600 --> 37:12.480]  police officer threatening to kill people threatening to kill journalists
[37:12.480 --> 37:20.240]  because he cusses NPR or the PBS channels would air this because it's
[37:20.240 --> 37:25.280]  documentary it doesn't violate the FCC if it's for documentary court style
[37:25.280 --> 37:30.200]  purposes I actually know the rulings but but but we're not we're going to beat
[37:30.200 --> 37:36.800]  it so as soon as we have that just about a 22nd clip we will play that and they
[37:36.800 --> 37:41.640]  just march up and they say you know I will have been kill you I will have
[37:41.640 --> 37:45.560]  been shoot you Alex we have the clip ready good we have the clip we're gonna
[37:45.560 --> 37:51.800]  play that clip and again there's just so much evidence so much proof for all the
[37:51.800 --> 37:56.360]  limited staff trying to go through this that's why it's so important for people
[37:56.360 --> 38:00.080]  to buy the products at info wars lifetov com and for store.com because then I
[38:00.080 --> 38:04.600]  can hire a couple more people to run the computers to pull up the news articles
[38:04.600 --> 38:08.520]  to pull up the clips to watch the clips to put them on air there's so much to
[38:08.520 --> 38:14.520]  digest here we would have more reporters to be able to be covering all of this
[38:14.520 --> 38:18.880]  I'm not complaining info wars is grown but I need to hire five or six more
[38:18.880 --> 38:23.120]  reporters I need to hire more print reporters I need to hire more camera
[38:23.120 --> 38:28.720]  people more video editors more people to look at the footage because we are just
[38:28.720 --> 38:32.320]  absolutely working as hard as we can and I'm just here having a personal
[38:32.320 --> 38:36.680]  discussion with the listeners out there about my frustrations and because
[38:36.680 --> 38:42.680]  we're all in this together and it is so horrible and so horrific to see this
[38:42.680 --> 38:46.320]  happening so we're gonna play that clip of the police officer bigger than
[38:46.320 --> 38:52.320]  dollars people can watch it unedited at info wars.com and prisonplata.com
[38:52.320 --> 38:58.480]  saying I will kill you I will shoot you to and grabbing and slamming reporters
[38:58.480 --> 39:04.840]  to the ground that are doing nothing we have clip after clip of my reporters in
[39:04.840 --> 39:11.400]  the middle of all this and Biggs Joe Biggs our reporter finding them all off
[39:11.400 --> 39:16.080]  cocktails trying to go get the police to look at him he dare not walk over with
[39:16.080 --> 39:21.200]  them a whole box of them stashed and ready the same rand that the police
[39:21.200 --> 39:25.160]  have claimed that they found one undetendated and showed on the news
[39:25.160 --> 39:30.640]  literally provocateur doing nothing about a stash of all off cocktails I mean
[39:30.640 --> 39:34.640]  that's a national news story stash of mall off cocktails found you're gonna
[39:34.640 --> 39:38.360]  hear from Joe Biggs a full breakdown of everything that happened with his report
[39:38.360 --> 39:43.320]  with Marcos Morales, Kit Daniels, Mikhail Phelan who they also pointed shotguns
[39:43.320 --> 39:48.160]  that threat to kill I mean this is getting crazy ladies and gentlemen so
[39:48.160 --> 40:15.960]  let's go ahead and play the clip from last night here it is
[40:48.160 --> 40:58.200]  now again that's footage shot by somebody else that was there we have it in
[40:58.200 --> 41:03.680]  HD and that's going to get uploaded by our exhausted crew there in Ferguson
[41:03.680 --> 41:08.800]  Missouri and it's going to get out to everybody but just what David Knight was
[41:08.800 --> 41:12.720]  saying you could disagree with Occupy Wall Street and their socialist views
[41:12.720 --> 41:16.400]  but they were right that it's the mega banks run in the country they were wrong
[41:16.400 --> 41:19.280]  to call it capitalism because these people are the opposite of capitalism
[41:19.280 --> 41:24.680]  they're monopoly fucks who are waging war against real prosperity but even if
[41:24.680 --> 41:30.320]  they were outright communist when they when it was declassified last year this
[41:30.320 --> 41:35.960]  is mainstream national news the plan to execute the peaceful leaders of Occupy
[41:35.960 --> 41:39.760]  Wall Street that means the ones the feds didn't control it turned out the
[41:39.760 --> 41:43.840]  Justice Department basically started it tried to run it it failed they tried to
[41:43.840 --> 41:48.280]  organize like an Arab Spring here even Al Gore said we did Arab Spring here in
[41:48.280 --> 41:53.760]  America they create the crisis then they give the police the training to go out
[41:53.760 --> 42:00.400]  and kill everybody so understand ladies and gentlemen that they are not going
[42:00.400 --> 42:04.600]  after the thugs in Ferguson they are not going after the gangsters the gang
[42:04.600 --> 42:08.400]  bangers they are not going after the mall off cocktail throwers are people
[42:08.400 --> 42:11.520]  throwing rocks people are throwing rocks in 20 feet away there's
[42:11.520 --> 42:16.760]  a journalist being attacked by the police and the police some of them say
[42:16.760 --> 42:20.560]  any info or as we love you some of the riot cops and some of the National Guard
[42:20.560 --> 42:26.760]  some of that's on video but the majority of them just see reporters and just just
[42:26.760 --> 42:32.280]  I mean they'll see like an old you know 65 year old guy with a pad of paper and a
[42:32.280 --> 42:35.800]  camera around his neck clearly a journalist wearing a vest they'll just
[42:35.800 --> 42:39.960]  run over and slam the guy on the ground I mean it's bizarre never has this
[42:39.960 --> 42:43.760]  happened in America they don't even do this in North Korea they would just come
[42:43.760 --> 42:47.600]  and get the journalist to take him away and then do stuff behind closed doors
[42:47.600 --> 42:55.480]  they're doing it out in the open this is beyond North Korea they have never put
[42:55.480 --> 42:59.520]  out public documents public for full unlimited distribution by the Department
[42:59.520 --> 43:08.000]  of Defense office of the Secretary of the Army saying to all the people being
[43:08.000 --> 43:12.080]  given riot control training police military you name it this is where you
[43:12.080 --> 43:18.840]  hit people to kill quote quote quote peaceful demonstrators quote have a
[43:18.840 --> 43:22.000]  shell shot for two days since this broke that's why I couldn't even hardly talk
[43:22.000 --> 43:25.800]  yesterday I was stuttering I was getting angry I was running around yelling in
[43:25.800 --> 43:31.680]  the halls because my normal instincts folks is we are in crisis level but
[43:31.680 --> 43:36.640]  that's healthy it is normal to get upset about this so pray for info war is
[43:36.640 --> 43:40.160]  render a lot of stress pray for our reporters but also the people they're
[43:40.160 --> 43:45.280]  having to watch this and then look at it and also be trying to tell our
[43:45.280 --> 43:50.120]  reporters what to do it's a very frustrating thing to have the
[43:50.120 --> 43:54.760]  responsibility to know that we're at the very cutting edge of this and to
[43:54.760 --> 43:59.360]  want to do a perfect job it'll grow enough always wonder why sports stars
[43:59.360 --> 44:04.160]  and adventures and people that push themselves to the edge would get so
[44:04.160 --> 44:07.760]  angry with themselves or never satisfied that's a mark of greatness
[44:07.760 --> 44:10.880]  ladies and gentlemen and that's why everybody up there running the show
[44:10.880 --> 44:14.440]  today David Knight his family what they've gone through to move down here
[44:14.440 --> 44:18.760]  and sell everything they had North Carolina all of my reporters from
[44:18.760 --> 44:23.160]  Jacarie Jackson to Leanne McAdoo to Marcos Morales to Rob Jacobson to Anthony
[44:23.160 --> 44:27.800]  Uchiarty everyone in the office from the shipping department to to to the
[44:27.800 --> 44:33.120]  customer service to the graphics people to the riders Don Salazar Kirk demo
[44:33.120 --> 44:38.200]  kit Daniels all of them this is an incredible team and I realized we need
[44:38.200 --> 44:41.640]  to celebrate the fact that we're blessed we're a very important position
[44:41.640 --> 44:46.760]  we're also under globalist attack spiritual attack economic attack but all
[44:46.760 --> 44:50.320]  Americans are under attack and I want to just tell everybody something I
[44:50.320 --> 44:54.880]  appreciate the listeners and I feel a kinship and a brotherhood and a sister
[44:54.880 --> 45:00.520]  hood with all of you we are family this is real this is epic this is happening
[45:00.520 --> 45:05.840]  this is beyond journalism this is just humans seeing tyranny unfold if they
[45:05.840 --> 45:10.080]  declared martial law if they had the NSA spying on us illegally if they funded
[45:10.080 --> 45:14.280]  radical Islam and ISIS if they turned over Christian areas and let ISIS
[45:14.280 --> 45:18.040]  murder everyone with US weapons if all this evil happened like that's
[45:18.040 --> 45:22.600]  inferious and Benghazi and Obamacare and two plus two equals five and in
[45:22.600 --> 45:27.480]  agenda 21 and Cloward and Piven if this all happened would someone stand up
[45:27.480 --> 45:33.240]  would someone do something and yes we are doing something I feel like in that
[45:33.240 --> 45:38.800]  movie that just came out with the rock it's it's pretty good for one of those
[45:38.800 --> 45:42.960]  entertaining movies Hercules went soft so my friends when he really was at the
[45:42.960 --> 45:48.440]  mythical Hercules but at the time that he needed to jump over that statue and
[45:48.440 --> 45:52.400]  crush the enemy he didn't dump the whole thing over he just found a weak spot and
[45:52.400 --> 45:56.360]  pushed as hard as he could get it like a woman picking a car up off her child and
[45:56.360 --> 46:01.200]  I'm telling you folks I can't lift this whole thing but all of us together can't
[46:01.200 --> 46:05.000]  lift it and that's why I get so angry because I know we've had victories I
[46:05.000 --> 46:08.640]  know we've changed history I know we've informed tens of billions I want to
[46:08.640 --> 46:12.440]  inform billions I want to stop these people I don't want us to convert to a
[46:12.440 --> 46:16.240]  total tyranny I want the cancer viruses out of the vaccine I don't want them
[46:16.240 --> 46:19.680]  dumbing our people down I don't want them coming after our guns I don't want
[46:19.680 --> 46:22.760]  them to take full control of this society they will do it we are in the
[46:22.760 --> 46:27.320]  hands of incredibly evil social engineers who have used toxic culture to
[46:27.320 --> 46:32.160]  turn the public into artificial sociopathic narcissistic mental
[46:32.160 --> 46:37.680]  patients mental illness is just raging disease is raging all the statistics show
[46:37.680 --> 46:43.720]  we are redlining humanity is in a great test in a huge crisis right now and it's
[46:43.720 --> 46:48.120]  time for us to get on our knees and ask God for guidance and to also remember
[46:48.120 --> 46:51.440]  our ancestors and to gain strength from everything they went through to
[46:51.440 --> 46:56.880]  understand this is the animating contest of liberty and it is disgusting and
[46:56.880 --> 47:01.800]  painful and horrible to see those police acting like demonic animals it is
[47:01.800 --> 47:07.040]  horrible and disgusting to see those crowds of surly entitled punks acting
[47:07.040 --> 47:13.560]  like absolute scum criminals and filth and racist trash you know just spewing
[47:13.560 --> 47:17.840]  all this division and garbage to play us off against each other but we can
[47:17.840 --> 47:22.400]  transcend it by recognizing it by pointing our finger at it and by saying
[47:22.400 --> 47:27.600]  it's wrong and a fraud so that's what I'm telling you here today if I took off
[47:27.600 --> 47:31.160]  the day because I wanted to get clarity and pull back from this and all of us
[47:31.160 --> 47:35.000]  have to do that we have to get outside their manipulation see it from the
[47:35.000 --> 47:39.240]  outside realize what it is and then intellectually fight it but also use our
[47:39.240 --> 47:45.920]  passion and our emotion scientifically to fuel the awakening like a
[47:45.920 --> 47:51.280]  transmission or you teach a spirit just like a pep rally of liberty and saying
[47:51.280 --> 47:55.640]  know the police state and know the NSA as all of the evil comes out of the
[47:55.640 --> 47:59.160]  closet forced inoculation your kids don't belong to you they belong to the
[47:59.160 --> 48:03.800]  state you didn't build your business somebody else did that they are just
[48:03.800 --> 48:08.480]  thrilling it in our face trying to antagonize us trying to cause a war
[48:08.480 --> 48:13.080]  trying to cause a civil war trying to order the police to do things they know
[48:13.080 --> 48:16.760]  will turn the whole country against them how stupid are these cops following
[48:16.760 --> 48:19.920]  these orders well they were picked because they would follow orders and I
[48:19.920 --> 48:25.120]  don't hate them I love those stupid rioters morons brought up for the
[48:25.120 --> 48:30.880]  television from birth you know captain crunch I feel sorry for those cops most
[48:30.880 --> 48:34.680]  of them brought up probably in broken families looking for manhood looking for
[48:34.680 --> 48:37.680]  a gang going to join in the police department thinking they're gonna find
[48:37.680 --> 48:42.600]  their daddy there I'm here to tell you right now you're gonna find your daddy
[48:42.600 --> 48:46.240]  when you find George Washington and the honorable men that came before us
[48:46.240 --> 48:50.640]  that's our daddy our daddy is not the new world order and a bunch of black
[48:50.640 --> 48:54.600]  uniforms and a bunch of cowardice and a bunch of weakness and America is better
[48:54.600 --> 48:58.320]  than that and we can turn the tide against this if we recognize what it is
[48:58.320 --> 49:02.920]  and vomit this poison up out of our guts turn it over to you but I'm just
[49:02.920 --> 49:07.200]  telling you it's like a race car that's got all this incredible horsepower that
[49:07.200 --> 49:11.640]  can blow an engine that's why we're so frustrated info wars because I see all
[49:11.640 --> 49:14.520]  these incredible videos all this incredible evidence we don't even have a
[49:14.520 --> 49:17.760]  way to digest it we're getting it all out to everybody that's why we need your
[49:17.760 --> 49:21.200]  help with articles we need your help to point stuff out in our videos we need
[49:21.200 --> 49:24.320]  your help to help us when we're wrong and help us when we're right and to
[49:24.320 --> 49:28.560]  financially support us and tell 10 people 20 people 50 people 100 people
[49:28.560 --> 49:31.320]  I don't want you to tell your friends and family about the show I want you to
[49:31.320 --> 49:35.400]  tell a hundred people about the show about info wars.com at the supermarket

[54:26.720 --> 54:31.600]  what's been going on for a long time I'm David Knight here with the Alex Jones
[54:31.600 --> 54:35.600]  show live in Austin we're gonna be joined later in the show with the CEO of the
[54:35.600 --> 54:38.480]  John Birch Society but I just wanted to reiterate what Alex was just talking
[54:38.480 --> 54:44.160]  about this outrageous report that was written just this last April and then
[54:44.160 --> 54:49.680]  publicly leaked and here's the takeaway things like this things like targeting
[54:49.680 --> 54:54.440]  political enemies using the IRS that used to be done secretly by presidents a
[54:54.440 --> 54:58.480]  lot of them did that Nixon got caught doing that Nixon got impeached for doing
[54:58.480 --> 55:04.600]  that now it's done openly now they don't care they know there's not going to be
[55:04.600 --> 55:10.520]  any consequences they violate the law openly Obama signs the NDAA says that
[55:10.520 --> 55:15.320]  he's going to arrest people and detain them indefinitely maybe send them out
[55:15.320 --> 55:19.560]  of the country for enhanced interrogation as they like to call it and of
[55:19.560 --> 55:23.320]  course there's he says he's not going to use it don't worry they're not going to
[55:23.320 --> 55:27.160]  use it I guess kind of like this training kind of like this equipment that we
[55:27.160 --> 55:33.640]  now see is being used it's amazing to me that they would let this stuff go out in
[55:33.640 --> 55:39.200]  our faces and now it is quite literally in our faces we have video this up on
[55:39.200 --> 55:43.280]  info wars.com Ferguson cop pointing a gun at journalists saying I'm going to
[55:43.280 --> 55:46.920]  effing kill you if you haven't seen this you need to go see this at the YouTube
[55:46.920 --> 55:50.360]  channel we're going to be playing that on for people who haven't heard this let's
[55:50.360 --> 55:54.040]  let's play that once more time one more time here let's you can see if you're
[55:54.040 --> 55:58.920]  watching this this guy's got his gun leveled sticks it right in the guy's
[55:58.920 --> 56:05.920]  face he's just sweeping the area with his gun leveled and everybody's face
[56:13.280 --> 56:18.080]  just amazing you need to see this where it's not bleeped out we can't play that
[56:18.080 --> 56:23.480]  because of communication rules but it's much more powerful as you see it on the
[56:23.480 --> 56:28.040]  YouTube channel watch it on our website now what's the takeaway from all this as
[56:28.040 --> 56:32.600]  we were talking to people in the area I was very disturbed to hear people that
[56:32.600 --> 56:37.120]  Jakari Jackson was interviewing someone that Joe Biggs had live on the radio a
[56:37.120 --> 56:42.040]  few days ago basically celebrating the fact that the feds are getting involved
[56:42.040 --> 56:45.160]  that they're going to step this down they think that that's going to solve
[56:45.160 --> 56:50.080]  everything they still don't understand that it's the federal government that is
[56:50.080 --> 56:53.640]  behind the militarization of the police and it's not just an Obama thing this
[56:53.640 --> 56:58.680]  has been going on for a very long time it's coming to a head now but this is
[56:58.680 --> 57:01.960]  something that's coming from the feds and as I mentioned we're going to have
[57:01.960 --> 57:06.800]  the president the CEO of the John Birch Society joining us later Arthur
[57:06.800 --> 57:10.760]  Thompson there's an article that was up on the New American which is their
[57:10.760 --> 57:16.160]  website yesterday says UN boss pushes quote international standards for the
[57:16.160 --> 57:20.680]  Ferguson police UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon is demanding that local
[57:20.680 --> 57:25.040]  law enforcement adhere to what his office cryptically referred to as quote
[57:25.040 --> 57:31.120]  international standards and Alex Newman who wrote this says those tempted to
[57:31.120 --> 57:35.560]  seek UN inspired quote international standards unquote for local American
[57:35.560 --> 57:40.200]  police forces should be careful what they wish for this is exactly what Alex
[57:40.200 --> 57:45.000]  was saying they want to have this step down they're now provoking it as big
[57:45.000 --> 57:49.960]  found yesterday a cache of Molotov cocktails showed it to the police they
[57:49.960 --> 57:55.480]  said go away you want to be bothered with it it all the signs of them trying
[57:55.480 --> 58:00.960]  to provoke this and now we see that the UN is joining in on this they would love
[58:00.960 --> 58:06.240]  to see this fail be escalated to the UN give them and another excuse to get
[58:06.240 --> 58:11.000]  involved what do we do about this program of the militarization of the
[58:11.000 --> 58:14.160]  police we're going to talk about that in the next segment as we come back from
[58:14.160 --> 58:18.880]  break we also have the reporters joining us live from Ferguson as I pointed out
[58:18.880 --> 58:22.800]  we have the CEO of the John Birch Society is going to be joining us in the

[1:00:25.240 --> 1:00:28.280]  Austin we're going to be joined in just a few minutes with our crew that is in
[1:00:28.280 --> 1:00:32.120]  Ferguson Missouri they're going to give us a live update as to what's going on
[1:00:32.120 --> 1:00:35.600]  there and of course there was a lot of news last night it's a video up right
[1:00:35.600 --> 1:00:41.240]  now showing a cop walking through a crowd yelling I'm going to effing kill
[1:00:41.240 --> 1:00:47.520]  you pointing guns at the people in their faces leveled in their faces that is
[1:00:47.520 --> 1:00:53.560]  something we have not seen before there's absolutely no reticence from this
[1:00:53.560 --> 1:00:56.840]  guy as Alex pointed out he's not wearing a mask he's not trying to hide his
[1:00:56.840 --> 1:01:01.160]  identity and just as we saw from this report that was released that was written
[1:01:01.160 --> 1:01:06.880]  only back in April of this year only four months ago there is no longer any
[1:01:06.880 --> 1:01:12.840]  attempt to conceal this kind of militarized martial law techniques that
[1:01:12.840 --> 1:01:18.320]  we see happening here in Ferguson this is in your face tyranny the mask has
[1:01:18.320 --> 1:01:23.240]  really come off the onion is talking about this they have pros and cons of
[1:01:23.240 --> 1:01:28.160]  militarizing the police and it's almost you can't go over the top with this but
[1:01:28.160 --> 1:01:30.640]  here's a couple of things they've got here they got modern law enforcement
[1:01:30.640 --> 1:01:34.440]  here's one of the pros modern law enforcement simply can't do their job
[1:01:34.440 --> 1:01:38.560]  properly by relying on handguns tasers and tear gas alone and now local
[1:01:38.560 --> 1:01:43.560]  journalists can capture the fog of war without leaving the United States it'd
[1:01:43.560 --> 1:01:46.920]  be a nice surprise treat for veterans to see weapons that they use in war now
[1:01:46.920 --> 1:01:51.120]  pop up on their own hometown streets and they say as cons the military style
[1:01:51.120 --> 1:01:54.640]  helmets limit your peripheral vision while firing indiscriminately into
[1:01:54.640 --> 1:02:00.080]  crowds and this kind of equipment could potentially be abused have put in
[1:02:00.080 --> 1:02:03.360]  lesser hands than America's historically honest and virtuous police
[1:02:03.360 --> 1:02:06.440]  departments well that's exactly what they're doing they've been putting
[1:02:06.440 --> 1:02:10.880]  massive amounts of equipment into the hands of the police department and it is
[1:02:10.880 --> 1:02:16.560]  growing exponentially the 1033 program of the Pentagon just this last year the
[1:02:16.560 --> 1:02:21.640]  Washington Post reports they gave away nearly half a billion dollars worth of
[1:02:21.640 --> 1:02:26.400]  military gear to local law enforcement last year are they not going to use it
[1:02:26.400 --> 1:02:31.760]  of course they're going to use it we're told that we're paranoid when we say
[1:02:31.760 --> 1:02:36.520]  that the NSA is listening to everyone is monitoring our conversations they lie
[1:02:36.520 --> 1:02:39.440]  about it before Congress and then it comes out they really are doing it
[1:02:39.440 --> 1:02:45.160]  Obama says signs the NDA and says that he's going to have indefinite
[1:02:45.160 --> 1:02:50.080]  detention of people in America because of course we are officially a war zone
[1:02:50.080 --> 1:02:54.360]  and then he says don't worry I'm not going to use it well we've heard that
[1:02:54.360 --> 1:02:58.240]  before now we see they really are using it as they pointed out here this 1033
[1:02:58.240 --> 1:03:04.680]  program transfers has transferred more than 4.3 billion dollars since 1997 but
[1:03:04.680 --> 1:03:09.840]  half of billion dollars happened in just the last year it's truly accelerating
[1:03:09.840 --> 1:03:13.360]  now this is an interesting story and we pointed this out the other night on the
[1:03:13.360 --> 1:03:18.240]  nightly news we talked about some of the things that could possibly be included
[1:03:18.240 --> 1:03:25.480]  in that and they said that back in June Alan Grayson author to bill went before
[1:03:25.480 --> 1:03:32.920]  the House to try to stop this 85% of the Congress wanted to not stop it they
[1:03:32.920 --> 1:03:36.400]  wanted to go through this they have a breakdown on this again Washington
[1:03:36.400 --> 1:03:43.960]  Post they show 210 out of the GOP 145 Democrats want the police departments to
[1:03:43.960 --> 1:03:48.840]  have this kind of militarized equipment only 19 Republicans and 43 Democrats
[1:03:48.840 --> 1:03:55.200]  only 15% of the House said no now what did they say no to well they said no to
[1:03:55.200 --> 1:04:01.560]  giving them things like this unmanned aerial vehicles armored vehicles grenade
[1:04:01.560 --> 1:04:06.520]  launchers silencers toxicological agents including chemical agents biological
[1:04:06.520 --> 1:04:11.080]  agents associated equipment launch vehicles guided missiles this is they're
[1:04:11.080 --> 1:04:14.600]  talking about giving this to police departments ballistic missiles rockets
[1:04:14.600 --> 1:04:20.200]  torpedoes bombs mines or nuclear weapons that was what was in his bill that is
[1:04:20.200 --> 1:04:24.680]  not what's in the 1033 program they leave that open they say that it's against
[1:04:24.680 --> 1:04:29.440]  the law for them to transfer hazardous material but they say that they will work
[1:04:29.440 --> 1:04:33.760]  with you if you need it so they leave the door open to it but let me make this
[1:04:33.760 --> 1:04:39.360]  clear even though it doesn't explicitly say that in the 1033 program the
[1:04:39.360 --> 1:04:46.800]  congressmen 85% of the congressmen both parties said they were fine if the
[1:04:46.800 --> 1:04:53.680]  Pentagon wanted to give nuclear biological and chemical weapons to the local
[1:04:53.680 --> 1:04:57.240]  police they had no problem with it they voted against that kind of prohibition

[1:08:28.200 --> 1:08:32.200]  interesting hour as I said we're going to be going to our reporters who are in
[1:08:32.200 --> 1:08:36.120]  Ferguson Missouri as we look at this buildup as this militarization of the
[1:08:36.120 --> 1:08:40.400]  police as we see the videos that went up last night with the threats against the
[1:08:40.400 --> 1:08:44.240]  reporters with loaded guns and people's faces who are standing there with a
[1:08:44.240 --> 1:08:49.000]  camera peaceful photojournalists standing there with the camera getting a loaded
[1:08:49.000 --> 1:08:53.800]  gun in their face with a cop swearing I'm going to effing shoot you I mean the
[1:08:53.800 --> 1:08:58.720]  guy is out of control why do we allow people like this to be in the police
[1:08:58.720 --> 1:09:03.480]  department can we get control of our local police it is something that is
[1:09:03.480 --> 1:09:08.000]  being driven by the federal government this is coming from the training from
[1:09:08.000 --> 1:09:12.240]  the equipment that they're sending them from the Pentagon as part of this 1033
[1:09:12.240 --> 1:09:18.600]  program just last June Alan Grayson Democrat from Florida had a bill that
[1:09:18.600 --> 1:09:23.040]  would prohibit this transfer of material and among the things that he would
[1:09:23.040 --> 1:09:28.840]  prohibit not just the over-the-top m-wraps and bear cats and grenade
[1:09:28.840 --> 1:09:33.360]  launchers and armored vehicles no he would also it listed in here as
[1:09:33.360 --> 1:09:38.680]  prohibitions would be things like chemical agents biological agents assorted
[1:09:38.680 --> 1:09:44.280]  equipment even nuclear weapons he had that whole list in there and guess what
[1:09:44.280 --> 1:09:50.760]  85% of the Congress the vast majority of both parties said no we don't want to
[1:09:50.760 --> 1:09:55.520]  prohibit any of that stuff from being given to the cops including nuclear
[1:09:55.520 --> 1:10:02.280]  biological and chemical weapons now if you look at the 1033 site it says why is
[1:10:02.280 --> 1:10:06.480]  hazardous material not authorized for transfer from the DLA disposition services
[1:10:06.480 --> 1:10:10.160]  field activity so it sounds at first like and their FAQ like they're not
[1:10:10.160 --> 1:10:14.200]  going to send this equipment there then they say that the law enforcement support
[1:10:14.200 --> 1:10:18.720]  office would handle that on a case-by-case basis so if you need nuclear
[1:10:18.720 --> 1:10:22.560]  biological chemical or toxicological agents to use on the citizens of your
[1:10:22.560 --> 1:10:27.960]  hometown you just need to talk to your law enforcement support office they will
[1:10:27.960 --> 1:10:30.800]  handle that for you that's something that takes a little bit more forms to
[1:10:30.800 --> 1:10:36.680]  fill out I guess but 85% of the Congress didn't have a problem with that they
[1:10:36.680 --> 1:10:41.920]  didn't want to shut that down let's go to our reporters now in Ferguson Missouri
[1:10:41.920 --> 1:10:45.840]  Joe Biggs here actually I'm in downtown St. Louis we got to pick up a little bit
[1:10:45.840 --> 1:10:53.640]  of equipment info calm last night David was the craziest night thus far although
[1:10:53.640 --> 1:10:59.200]  tear gas and flashbanks weren't used that night was the first time I actually
[1:10:59.200 --> 1:11:04.360]  thought I would be killed wow it last night was complete in total
[1:11:04.360 --> 1:11:10.280]  hollessness chaos on both sides agent provocateurs in the area I was up we got
[1:11:10.280 --> 1:11:13.440]  there and they had moved the media area when I first got there had been to the
[1:11:13.440 --> 1:11:19.320]  left of the McDonald's they completely tore that down it was no set up so the
[1:11:19.320 --> 1:11:24.800]  crew and I went and walked around and we saw a bunch of the media vehicles stage
[1:11:24.800 --> 1:11:27.880]  on the left side of the road but they didn't have any tape and there was no
[1:11:27.880 --> 1:11:32.400]  security around them last night whatsoever instead the the actual
[1:11:32.400 --> 1:11:37.320]  civilians or protesters were able to walk behind and get behind that area and a
[1:11:37.320 --> 1:11:40.920]  lot of the thing notice I was well down the road I started I looked under this
[1:11:40.920 --> 1:11:45.360]  bin right beside the road and there were bottles stored under it and I was like
[1:11:45.360 --> 1:11:48.600]  man this is not good I was like I'm just gonna go and talk to one of these
[1:11:48.600 --> 1:11:51.960]  officers and let them know because if something happens with this it's gonna
[1:11:51.960 --> 1:11:57.000]  cause chaos and it's gonna go back to a complete and total war zone again so I
[1:11:57.000 --> 1:12:01.840]  went up to numerous officers said hey just so you guys know heads up I've seen
[1:12:01.840 --> 1:12:06.080]  a bunch of bottles stored in this one area the same kind they're laying under
[1:12:06.080 --> 1:12:11.840]  there and you guys might want to do something about that oh okay and then
[1:12:11.840 --> 1:12:15.480]  just turns around and turn back on me I went to another one I said hey I just
[1:12:15.480 --> 1:12:18.720]  told another guy he's not taking this seriously there's a bunch of stuff over
[1:12:18.720 --> 1:12:22.840]  here y'all need to look at it once again didn't care they're more worried
[1:12:22.840 --> 1:12:27.880]  about what we were doing and not worried about what was gonna happen to spark
[1:12:27.880 --> 1:12:31.880]  violence out there whatsoever yeah they're very concerned about being
[1:12:31.880 --> 1:12:36.800]  photographed there was an article on reason.com asking why haven't we seen
[1:12:36.800 --> 1:12:40.760]  any aerial footage of this we've seen all kinds of graphics showing where this
[1:12:40.760 --> 1:12:44.760]  area is and showing where the police are here but typically in a news scenario
[1:12:44.760 --> 1:12:47.760]  like this you usually got aerial footage of helicopters and they pointed out
[1:12:47.760 --> 1:12:52.080]  well they grounded everybody after they said a police helicopter was shot at yet
[1:12:52.080 --> 1:12:57.080]  the police helicopters are still flying and are the journalists at any more
[1:12:57.080 --> 1:13:01.000]  danger and a helicopter thousands of feet above the ground than they are when
[1:13:01.000 --> 1:13:05.760]  the police point loaded guns in their face and threatened to kill them well
[1:13:05.760 --> 1:13:12.560]  last night Kit saw somebody who was began to throw rocks and the protesters
[1:13:12.560 --> 1:13:16.880]  turned on him you can see the video about that this guy was from out of town
[1:13:16.880 --> 1:13:21.960]  he was a revogator trying to cause violence in that area between the
[1:13:21.960 --> 1:13:27.800]  peaceful protests and the police officers the guys ran behind the media some
[1:13:27.800 --> 1:13:31.720]  rubber bullet rounds were fired and everybody got tense the police starts
[1:13:31.720 --> 1:13:34.680]  you know and I'm sitting on the side of the road like oh my god oh my god and
[1:13:34.680 --> 1:13:39.360]  all the sudden I see this officer run up to the a camera guy and puts the M4
[1:13:39.360 --> 1:13:43.480]  right in front of his face he says I'll been kill you and he's like don't do
[1:13:43.480 --> 1:13:48.920]  anything he just starts screaming do it man it's amazing yeah we played that
[1:13:48.920 --> 1:13:54.360]  several times we had to bleep that out and it's absolutely up to him and he
[1:13:54.360 --> 1:13:57.560]  pointed the gun at me and they're filming like hey what's going on and he's got
[1:13:57.560 --> 1:14:02.360]  the gun at my chest I mean this guy was so hot-headed he was ready to snap it
[1:14:02.360 --> 1:14:05.600]  took a female officers to come over and grab him saying what are you doing and
[1:14:05.600 --> 1:14:10.520]  pulled him out of the area this guy was out of his mind and that's exactly what
[1:14:10.520 --> 1:14:13.480]  people need to take a look at this on YouTube's name he wouldn't give us
[1:14:13.480 --> 1:14:18.440]  anything the guy said what's your name and he told him to go f himself so now
[1:14:18.440 --> 1:14:24.280]  the guy on Twitter is a officer go f yourself it's all over the internet now
[1:14:24.280 --> 1:14:29.640]  what what really is scary is is to watch this and to see the freeze frame where
[1:14:29.640 --> 1:14:34.000]  you can see the expression on the guy's face I mean he is clearly out of
[1:14:34.000 --> 1:14:38.120]  control clearly afraid and that's where you have the out of control shootings
[1:14:38.120 --> 1:14:43.280]  this is the kind of spirit that we see that is this causing these types of
[1:14:43.280 --> 1:14:47.480]  incidents that trigger things like this Michael Brown shooting it's the training
[1:14:47.480 --> 1:14:52.800]  the lack of training and the kind of rules of engagement that they're
[1:14:52.800 --> 1:14:56.680]  promoting we've got Alex Jones joining us on the line let's go to Alex and get
[1:14:56.680 --> 1:15:00.400]  his comments I want to go back to the reporters here in a moment but again I'm
[1:15:00.400 --> 1:15:04.720]  here monitoring the situation oh you have your guests coming up but we need to
[1:15:04.720 --> 1:15:09.760]  just look at the big picture here okay we need to understand they shot someone
[1:15:09.760 --> 1:15:12.680]  else yesterday we don't know what really happened with that this is
[1:15:12.680 --> 1:15:18.200]  continuing to escalate the Justice Department under Obama has a history of
[1:15:18.200 --> 1:15:25.000]  provocaturing things Joe Biggs found a cache of the same mohawk cocktails that
[1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:31.120]  the police were showing the media two days before and would not go get the
[1:15:31.120 --> 1:15:36.000]  cache of mohawk cocktails there were literally 50 yards from them and looked
[1:15:36.000 --> 1:15:40.560]  guilty whenever Biggs was explaining what was going on this fits in with them
[1:15:40.560 --> 1:15:45.720]  not going to throw bricks at them not going to people that throw cocktails
[1:15:45.720 --> 1:15:50.040]  at them but attacking the reporters savagely this is an attack on the first
[1:15:50.040 --> 1:15:59.320]  amendment now that's not why I called in from day one there have been scores of
[1:15:59.320 --> 1:16:06.240]  black witnesses who were there who said again the police are not bringing
[1:16:06.240 --> 1:16:11.120]  people on the news the police are not releasing the full reports that's what
[1:16:11.120 --> 1:16:14.240]  we've got cops calling in saying yeah they need to release that that's why
[1:16:14.240 --> 1:16:18.040]  something's going on here and we thought it might have been because they were
[1:16:18.040 --> 1:16:23.520]  lying but I in the last two days have found a bunch of videos I heard a police
[1:16:23.520 --> 1:16:27.360]  officer call in a few days ago from New York and he said you need to look these
[1:16:27.360 --> 1:16:33.480]  up so I finally got around to it yesterday I've checked the audio and I've
[1:16:33.480 --> 1:16:40.800]  gone and found other witnesses and it is the video where the witnesses are
[1:16:40.800 --> 1:16:46.520]  talking about how he climbed up on the truck and basically you know went
[1:16:46.520 --> 1:16:51.520]  crazy attacking the police vehicle ran away the cop got out told him stop he
[1:16:51.520 --> 1:16:57.400]  turned and charged back this is the brown shooting the 18-year-old guy that got
[1:16:57.400 --> 1:17:01.720]  shot a few weeks ago to start all this for your new listener and these are
[1:17:01.720 --> 1:17:05.800]  eyewitnesses standing around talking because it was in a populated housing
[1:17:05.800 --> 1:17:12.280]  project area and confirming what the police said so again why did they not
[1:17:12.280 --> 1:17:16.400]  then roll all these witnesses out we know they've been interviewing them why
[1:17:16.400 --> 1:17:21.560]  have they basically had a response attacking the press day one because
[1:17:21.560 --> 1:17:24.520]  everybody keeps saying the feds are coming the feds are coming folks we had
[1:17:24.520 --> 1:17:31.400]  reporters there by what the Monday after so so we had reporters there three days
[1:17:31.400 --> 1:17:35.600]  into this okay before anybody else was there except the Washington Post and a
[1:17:35.600 --> 1:17:39.160]  few others they were arresting reporters day one when the police see
[1:17:39.160 --> 1:17:45.120]  reporters they I mean they look like a badger hound a doxen that's trying to
[1:17:45.120 --> 1:17:49.120]  kill rats we ever seen a doxen sees a rat folks he goes crazy goes into piranha
[1:17:49.120 --> 1:17:54.160]  mode I mean it's like they were trained to attack us it's like a bear dog you
[1:17:54.160 --> 1:17:59.720]  know that's trying to attack bears or or a you know blue-curr you know
[1:17:59.720 --> 1:18:03.480]  grappling dog or whatever that's trained to go after wall walks they are just
[1:18:03.480 --> 1:18:09.640]  moved just ready to attack absolutely hate the media when the media day one
[1:18:09.640 --> 1:18:14.600]  didn't do anything so this is this is a sigh of undoubtedly the evidence is he's
[1:18:14.600 --> 1:18:18.760]  really mounting now and we know that MSNBC has been pushing a whole race for
[1:18:18.760 --> 1:18:21.400]  agenda we're gonna skip this network break this is too important that no more
[1:18:21.400 --> 1:18:25.640]  skipping breaks today or tomorrow folks I really shouldn't do this for the
[1:18:25.640 --> 1:18:28.880]  network just financially support us though folks support sponsors it's just
[1:18:28.880 --> 1:18:34.880]  this information is so incredibly key so the name of the video that I hope you'll
[1:18:34.880 --> 1:18:40.680]  play later today it's a minute 22 seconds long it's titled new evidence we
[1:18:40.680 --> 1:18:44.200]  need an article out on this when you get this video posted info wars.com right
[1:18:44.200 --> 1:18:48.920]  now we need to tweak this out right now look at my article around it and the
[1:18:48.920 --> 1:18:54.000]  other witnesses new evidence in Michael Brown shooting witnesses confirm Brown
[1:18:54.000 --> 1:19:00.480]  rushed officer before being shot this was posted yesterday only has 374 views
[1:19:00.480 --> 1:19:05.080]  new evidence that Michael Brown shooting witnesses confirm Brown rushed
[1:19:05.080 --> 1:19:10.440]  officer before being shot now I know there's some other videos also shot by
[1:19:10.440 --> 1:19:17.040]  people saying the exact same thing so again people like want to manipulate
[1:19:17.040 --> 1:19:20.960]  reality for what they want to believe if the cop killed him in cold blood because
[1:19:20.960 --> 1:19:24.480]  they're training to be mad dogs then he should get in trouble he should go to
[1:19:24.480 --> 1:19:28.860]  prison but if the guy attacked him twice he had a right to shoot him I would have
[1:19:28.860 --> 1:19:32.560]  done the same thing so why aren't they telling the truth here I want to get

[1:19:58.160 --> 1:20:02.160]  guys now but I don't want to get caught in the minutiae the emotion of the
[1:20:02.160 --> 1:20:05.320]  police officer threatened to kill you guys and threatened to kill Michael
[1:20:05.320 --> 1:20:09.480]  tailing behind the mini mark I understand we know that happened it's
[1:20:09.480 --> 1:20:13.560]  important the videos in HD up on info wars.com and you can hear it with all
[1:20:13.560 --> 1:20:17.560]  the cussing and then it's congruent you can understand it it's very clear I want
[1:20:17.560 --> 1:20:22.200]  to commend Biggs and all of you for having the stamina to not blow up in
[1:20:22.200 --> 1:20:26.120]  the face of this or to not just get exhausted get a migraine headache I do
[1:20:26.120 --> 1:20:28.960]  not want you guys I'm saying this again or I'm gonna pull you guys out of there
[1:20:28.960 --> 1:20:32.280]  I do not want you guys I know you weren't in the front lines this time they're
[1:20:32.280 --> 1:20:35.880]  just running over to you threatened to kill you but I just do not need you guys
[1:20:35.880 --> 1:20:39.880]  to get killed and I'm telling you if this continues they're going to kill
[1:20:39.880 --> 1:20:43.520]  journalists they're going to open up on a crowd they've got a bunch of National
[1:20:43.520 --> 1:20:47.800]  Guard kids who look like they're 16 years old with Beretta nine millimeters on
[1:20:47.800 --> 1:20:52.360]  their side this is escalating quickly all sorts of anarchists you know white
[1:20:52.360 --> 1:20:56.880]  method kids are now showing up from Chicago in places this is about to get
[1:20:56.880 --> 1:21:03.440]  really bad but I need you guys to pretty much operate we've got zoom cameras we
[1:21:03.440 --> 1:21:06.560]  can overnight to you I just need you guys to start operating from a distance
[1:21:06.560 --> 1:21:10.080]  I've seen Marcos Morales walking right up to the police line with our arresting
[1:21:10.080 --> 1:21:14.360]  people very brave but we just don't need that and I mean this is this is getting
[1:21:14.360 --> 1:21:19.640]  out of control this is martial law this is police trained a journalist trained
[1:21:19.640 --> 1:21:24.480]  to kill journalists during martial law just like in Baghdad Reuters got targeted
[1:21:24.480 --> 1:21:31.360]  during 2003 by the Abrams tanks blowing up the floors that Reuters was in this
[1:21:31.360 --> 1:21:36.960]  is just absolutely out of control and this is the barbarism of our society
[1:21:36.960 --> 1:21:41.800]  as we descend into this immoral garbage they're preparing us for a civil war
[1:21:41.800 --> 1:21:45.800]  there's no doubt this is a martial law beta test so Joe Biggs other reporters
[1:21:45.800 --> 1:21:48.760]  only you guys for the rest of the hour with David Knight to break all this down

[1:23:23.640 --> 1:23:27.760]  heavy combat and it was as well as Rolling Stone others followed you for
[1:23:27.760 --> 1:23:31.720]  three years three tours I know this is you were telling me on the phone
[1:23:31.720 --> 1:23:35.680]  yesterday or video Skype off air this is the most angry and freaked out you've
[1:23:35.680 --> 1:23:41.040]  ever been is that because this is your country and I mean I've seen the videos
[1:23:41.040 --> 1:23:45.400]  the Taliban they capture it I don't see that much hatred in their eyes for our
[1:23:45.400 --> 1:23:49.920]  troops even though they're absolutely hate you then the police have towards
[1:23:49.920 --> 1:23:55.720]  our media why do the police have such a hatred of the American people what has
[1:23:55.720 --> 1:23:59.520]  happened to them I want you to comment on that and for David night to take over
[1:23:59.520 --> 1:24:04.240]  again you are listening to him fall wars live broadcasting worldwide this is real
[1:24:04.240 --> 1:24:09.160]  media this is real analysis this is wearing the truth openly on our sleeve
[1:24:09.160 --> 1:24:13.720]  openly promoting our bias of telling the truth promoting liberty I'm Alex
[1:24:13.720 --> 1:24:19.320]  Jones signing off for the day I hand the baton over to the crew go ahead Joe
[1:24:19.320 --> 1:24:24.800]  respond what Alex just asked you about what is it that makes the that that
[1:24:24.800 --> 1:24:28.720]  drives this this fear and this hatred that you saw in the eyes of this cop
[1:24:28.720 --> 1:24:34.960]  last night the guy had to have been on some kind of mind-altering drug or
[1:24:34.960 --> 1:24:39.160]  something I mean the guy was just belligerent out of his mind he had that
[1:24:39.160 --> 1:24:43.080]  look of like a like a rabid dog like he was just looking he didn't have any
[1:24:43.080 --> 1:24:47.000]  emotion other than hate he just wanted to bite and attack and that's all he
[1:24:47.000 --> 1:24:50.680]  cared about and like a pit bull that's just a rabbit or whatever like that is
[1:24:50.680 --> 1:24:54.640]  crazy the owners got to come and grab him by his collar and rip him back and
[1:24:54.640 --> 1:24:59.200]  ask what had to happen last night don't be another one another thing as well
[1:24:59.200 --> 1:25:02.360]  don't be fooled by this captain Johnson I know he comes off on these press
[1:25:02.360 --> 1:25:07.160]  conferences as you know this fun-loving guy who's very passionate about what he
[1:25:07.160 --> 1:25:10.840]  does and he's a family man I'm gonna let you know right now he was walking in
[1:25:10.840 --> 1:25:14.480]  the middle of the streets with the police thugs pointing a journalist
[1:25:14.480 --> 1:25:19.560]  telling them to arrest him and then like five guys would grab them and toss them
[1:25:19.560 --> 1:25:23.160]  to a ground there was a guy who was maybe 60 years old who was thrown to the
[1:25:23.160 --> 1:25:27.040]  ground put a knee in his back and they were just elbowing as they started
[1:25:27.040 --> 1:25:31.480]  up so let me let me reiterate this so you're saying that Ron Johnson the guy
[1:25:31.480 --> 1:25:35.320]  that was put in place by the governor Nixon I think would put him in charge
[1:25:35.320 --> 1:25:38.600]  because they weren't happy with the way the county was handling things they said
[1:25:38.600 --> 1:25:43.120]  so this guy Ron Johnson is walking down the street pointing out journalists and
[1:25:43.120 --> 1:25:46.800]  then they're going over and physically attacking journalists you mentioned one
[1:25:46.800 --> 1:25:51.520]  of the guys is who's fairly old yes I mean he pointed at Marcos at one point
[1:25:51.520 --> 1:25:56.680]  and had to rip Marcos back he said get him him that guy and they came they you
[1:25:56.680 --> 1:25:59.840]  know one of the guys sort of walking over like no no stop I got it I got it
[1:25:59.840 --> 1:26:04.360]  and I pulled Marcos back or whatever but he was clearly sitting there just like
[1:26:04.360 --> 1:26:09.640]  a goon walking with a it's easy to be brave when you've got 10 15 guys just
[1:26:09.640 --> 1:26:13.840]  walking beside you with guns pointed at people and he just walking behind them
[1:26:13.840 --> 1:26:17.600]  you know nonchalant just smiling and looking and pointing at people like oh
[1:26:17.600 --> 1:26:21.280]  that guy right there oh no that guy over there him right there get him you know
[1:26:21.280 --> 1:26:27.800]  that that's ridiculous on TV is a lie that's what so disturbing when we talk
[1:26:27.800 --> 1:26:32.120]  to people there who basically are MSNBC listeners like the guy that was on the
[1:26:32.120 --> 1:26:35.920]  radio the other day that when you were talking to Alex and you had that guy he
[1:26:35.920 --> 1:26:39.920]  he was talking about how he was so happy that the feds were coming in now they
[1:26:39.920 --> 1:26:43.600]  really don't understand what's going on and I tell you Joe I think one of the
[1:26:43.600 --> 1:26:49.720]  most dangerous things about this is going to be if they held back information
[1:26:49.720 --> 1:26:53.400]  that from the very beginning could have shown that this police officer was
[1:26:53.400 --> 1:26:59.400]  acting in self-defense if they wait and let this situation fester by hiding the
[1:26:59.400 --> 1:27:03.520]  evidence by confiscating cameras from people by being closed-lipped and
[1:27:03.520 --> 1:27:07.480]  shutting down not talking to anybody and then at some point they show it to a
[1:27:07.480 --> 1:27:10.640]  jury but they still don't make it public because that's the mode in which our
[1:27:10.640 --> 1:27:13.840]  government operates anymore they shut everything down they don't want to talk
[1:27:13.840 --> 1:27:16.800]  to the press they don't want the press to be able to take pictures they don't
[1:27:16.800 --> 1:27:20.840]  want citizens to see anything they keep all this information secret so that if
[1:27:20.840 --> 1:27:25.320]  they really did have justification for this people aren't going to believe it
[1:27:25.320 --> 1:27:29.840]  they're going to burn that town down if the guy was acting reasonably if the
[1:27:29.840 --> 1:27:33.880]  police officer was acting reasonably and the jury lets him off that's really
[1:27:33.880 --> 1:27:38.480]  going to be the ultimate provocaturing I think well the scary thing as well
[1:27:38.480 --> 1:27:41.520]  though what I noticed last night I have one of the videos up on the river
[1:27:41.520 --> 1:27:48.120]  Bologna's YouTube channel trendies there are a lot of young teenage white girls
[1:27:48.120 --> 1:27:53.960]  from suburbia outside of that area from other states just out here because they
[1:27:53.960 --> 1:27:57.480]  think it's cool to be in a police state they were walking around laughing on
[1:27:57.480 --> 1:28:00.640]  their cell phones talking to him bubblegum like oh my god this is so much
[1:28:00.640 --> 1:28:05.280]  fun look at all these police are pointing guns at us yay and I'm sitting
[1:28:05.280 --> 1:28:10.240]  here like really this is what our the generation below us is thinking these are
[1:28:10.240 --> 1:28:14.080]  what the kids think it's cool to live in a police state are they trying to change
[1:28:14.080 --> 1:28:18.520]  it to where you know my essence is is I have a fight in me like a dog if you
[1:28:18.520 --> 1:28:22.360]  pin me up I'm gonna try to get out of there I'm not gonna sit there and just
[1:28:22.360 --> 1:28:27.880]  be tortured and beaten down and told what I can and can't do I have me these
[1:28:27.880 --> 1:28:32.680]  kids were just you know yay police state it blew my mind to see that and I kept
[1:28:32.680 --> 1:28:36.880]  pointing out I was like Marcos look at that look at the I have not seen kids out
[1:28:36.880 --> 1:28:40.880]  here before they're just running around having fun sitting down taking selfies
[1:28:40.880 --> 1:28:45.160]  taking pictures having a good old time meanwhile everyone else there is really
[1:28:45.160 --> 1:28:47.960]  worried about the safety in their life whether or not they're even gonna make it
[1:28:47.960 --> 1:28:52.120]  home it's a social media crowd you know it's it's playing with Facebook it's
[1:28:52.120 --> 1:28:55.800]  playing video games they can't believe that there's any real consequences to
[1:28:55.800 --> 1:29:00.000]  life it's amazing to me to see and we reported and there was an article up on
[1:29:00.000 --> 1:29:05.000]  info wars.com that the police were driving by literally driving by this is
[1:29:05.000 --> 1:29:08.960]  being reported by USA Today mainstream media it's not just us it's reporting it
[1:29:08.960 --> 1:29:12.800]  that the police inexplicably are driving by looters as this is going on
[1:29:12.800 --> 1:29:17.400]  they're parked just a few feet down as the buildings are being burned and looted
[1:29:17.400 --> 1:29:22.000]  and not doing anything and yet you look at how proactive they are how in your
[1:29:22.000 --> 1:29:25.600]  face they are when it comes to peaceful demonstrators and to the press it's
[1:29:25.600 --> 1:29:29.560]  absolutely everything to collapse yes absolutely we're gonna be right back
[1:29:29.560 --> 1:29:33.560]  with Joe Biggs and Ferguson Missouri stay with us right after the break and
[1:29:33.560 --> 1:29:37.240]  we're gonna be joined later in the program with the president or the CEO
[1:29:37.240 --> 1:29:41.040]  rather of the John Birch Society Arthur Thompson stay with us we'll be right
[1:29:41.040 --> 1:29:43.200]  back
[1:29:47.280 --> 1:29:54.360]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[1:29:54.360 --> 1:29:56.800]  network

[1:30:07.560 --> 1:30:12.920]  deficiency has been a crisis around the world iodine is key to so many of the

[1:32:03.800 --> 1:32:07.560]  more and more toxic each and every day but it's not just the air outside that's
[1:32:07.560 --> 1:32:11.720]  toxic indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations
[1:32:11.720 --> 1:32:15.800]  of pollutants than even outdoor air and most Americans spend 90% of their time
[1:32:15.800 --> 1:32:19.880]  inside using toxic chemicals within their homes there are more than 42
[1:32:19.880 --> 1:32:23.960]  million smokers in the United States well over a thousand types of mold and
[1:32:23.960 --> 1:32:27.920]  mildew linked to numerous conditions and don't forget the fact that six million
[1:32:27.920 --> 1:32:31.080]  Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well when I began to
[1:32:31.080 --> 1:32:35.160]  research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my

[1:33:15.320 --> 1:33:21.920]  Alex Jones welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight live in
[1:33:21.920 --> 1:33:26.960]  Austin and we have joining us live in Ferguson Missouri Joe Biggs are the
[1:33:26.960 --> 1:33:30.560]  info wars crew they're covering the unrest and of course there were a lot of
[1:33:30.560 --> 1:33:36.080]  updates last night Joe what's happening today so far that that you say how's the
[1:33:36.080 --> 1:33:43.280]  climate there oh well this morning at nine they began the the process to find
[1:33:43.280 --> 1:33:49.040]  out whether or not the police officer is you know rightfully rightful in
[1:33:49.040 --> 1:33:54.440]  shooting of the Michael Brown or if he's to be convicted and found guilty so that
[1:33:54.440 --> 1:33:59.600]  starts today we won't know the actual verdict for that for a couple weeks from
[1:33:59.600 --> 1:34:04.480]  what Kit was told there was only media out there this morning at the location
[1:34:04.480 --> 1:34:08.720]  stuff's pretty calm at this point but you know as we know as the day grows
[1:34:08.720 --> 1:34:14.920]  people start to get off work about four o'clock or so it begins to heat up very
[1:34:14.920 --> 1:34:18.560]  quick yeah it always happens every night now they still have a curfew is that
[1:34:18.560 --> 1:34:24.400]  correct every night or is that well okay well technically they're not saying
[1:34:24.400 --> 1:34:27.720]  there's a curfew and this is one of the questions we asked in the press
[1:34:27.720 --> 1:34:30.960]  conference why didn't specifically ask for one of the journalists they're asked
[1:34:30.960 --> 1:34:34.880]  and said I thought you said there wasn't a curfew captain Johnson he's like
[1:34:34.880 --> 1:34:38.920]  correct there isn't one and then she goes well you had everyone off the roads
[1:34:38.920 --> 1:34:45.480]  by 1230 isn't that a curfew and then he starts talking about his family so he's
[1:34:45.480 --> 1:34:49.400]  obviously trying to dodge anything that has to do with that so technically on
[1:34:49.400 --> 1:34:54.360]  paper there's not a curfew but at a certain time they start pointing guns
[1:34:54.360 --> 1:34:57.880]  at us and threatening to kill us and that's basically a curfew that's a
[1:34:57.880 --> 1:35:02.480]  that's a martial law that's a police state that's hell it seems to me like if
[1:35:02.480 --> 1:35:06.440]  people are peacefully assembling and redressing their grievances if the press
[1:35:06.440 --> 1:35:11.280]  is doing its work covering those people doing that that that shouldn't be a
[1:35:11.280 --> 1:35:14.800]  problem at any time that it that people want to do that when you start
[1:35:14.800 --> 1:35:19.160]  constraining the First Amendment by an area like we saw happen in Nevada like
[1:35:19.160 --> 1:35:23.000]  we've seen happen the last several presidential conventions political
[1:35:23.000 --> 1:35:26.720]  conventions for both parties where they take the protesters or demonstrators at
[1:35:26.720 --> 1:35:30.920]  the political convention and they put them in a cage several blocks down from
[1:35:30.920 --> 1:35:35.640]  where they're having the convention when they set up a free speech area in Nevada
[1:35:35.640 --> 1:35:39.200]  and say if you get out of this we're going to attack and arrest you they've
[1:35:39.200 --> 1:35:44.360]  essentially done the same thing but with a time constraint not with an area
[1:35:44.360 --> 1:35:49.040]  constraint here you know the First Amendment infringed and constrained is
[1:35:49.040 --> 1:35:52.640]  no longer free speech it's no longer freedom of the press when they do that
[1:35:52.640 --> 1:35:58.160]  to people I I feel as we look at this and this is what I think is really the
[1:35:58.160 --> 1:36:01.520]  dangerous thing that's going on here is we see them in the face of the press as
[1:36:01.520 --> 1:36:06.160]  we see them try to cover up evidence as we now see in the last few days multiple
[1:36:06.160 --> 1:36:10.600]  reports from eyewitnesses now saying that he was that that Michael Brown was
[1:36:10.600 --> 1:36:14.400]  shot all the shots were in the front as opposed to what we had originally heard
[1:36:14.400 --> 1:36:18.440]  that there were a couple of shots in the back I think that's perhaps the biggest
[1:36:18.440 --> 1:36:23.960]  powder keg that may come out of this yet after they make this look like the after
[1:36:23.960 --> 1:36:27.080]  they lie to people after they cover stuff up after they hide everything then
[1:36:27.080 --> 1:36:30.080]  when they come out if they eventually tell the truth nobody's going to believe
[1:36:30.080 --> 1:36:35.080]  them yeah people will be so angry it's not even regardless of the outcome of
[1:36:35.080 --> 1:36:38.760]  the situation there's so much hate in this area there's so much hate from
[1:36:38.760 --> 1:36:42.480]  outsiders who have nothing to even do with this that are just coming out here
[1:36:42.480 --> 1:36:48.360]  to cause havoc and just completely help be a part of the social collapse in
[1:36:48.360 --> 1:36:52.880]  Ferguson I mean right now they're essentially from 10 o'clock at night
[1:36:52.880 --> 1:36:56.360]  until about 5 o'clock in the morning you don't have any constitutional rights
[1:36:56.360 --> 1:37:00.480]  whatsoever in that area they treat you like an animal you know you can't you
[1:37:00.480 --> 1:37:04.600]  cannot move freely if you stand still I was standing still on the side of the
[1:37:04.600 --> 1:37:08.520]  ball taking a break last night for a little bit because you know as you know
[1:37:08.520 --> 1:37:12.280]  I've been out here this is my ninth day and I'm out here you know maybe 18 hours
[1:37:12.280 --> 1:37:16.200]  a day standing up and I just needed to take a break for a minute a cop ran over
[1:37:16.200 --> 1:37:20.360]  he's like I've been screaming at you you better keep moving get your butt out of
[1:37:20.360 --> 1:37:23.440]  here and I'm sitting here just like in the middle of nowhere there's no one
[1:37:23.440 --> 1:37:27.160]  around me I even went off into a dark area outside of the main stuff for the
[1:37:27.160 --> 1:37:30.800]  protests where just to get away from the madness and try to relax for a second
[1:37:30.800 --> 1:37:35.200]  and get off my feet and this man ran over to me with his baton yelling yeah
[1:37:35.200 --> 1:37:39.560]  yeah deliberately being provocative just like the guy who is leveling the guns
[1:37:39.560 --> 1:37:44.320]  at everybody these are the new rules of engagement it's just absolutely amazing
[1:37:44.320 --> 1:37:47.800]  the gloves have come off they're no longer trying to hide anything they
[1:37:47.800 --> 1:37:52.600]  war game this out they they say that they're looking to use snipers against
[1:37:52.600 --> 1:37:57.280]  leaders of the peaceful demonstrators and they put this out this is this
[1:37:57.280 --> 1:38:00.000]  document that they wrote just four months ago they put it out publicly
[1:38:00.000 --> 1:38:04.960]  without even classifying it they no longer even care that what they're doing
[1:38:04.960 --> 1:38:09.320]  is illegal that it is treasonous essentially this these would be war
[1:38:09.320 --> 1:38:12.920]  crimes if they did it in another country but they're talking about doing this here
[1:38:12.920 --> 1:38:16.800]  in the continental United States this is the way they're planning it the same
[1:38:16.800 --> 1:38:21.080]  man who arrested us in Virginia if you remember the ace symmetric where for a
[1:38:21.080 --> 1:38:26.800]  group I have reports and we've seen them last night throughout the internet
[1:38:26.800 --> 1:38:30.400]  things like that they're supposed to be a symmetric warfare X Navy SEAL types
[1:38:30.400 --> 1:38:36.000]  coming here now to help provide security with the police so of course they've
[1:38:36.000 --> 1:38:39.280]  been training for area yes that's exactly what they've been training for and
[1:38:39.280 --> 1:38:42.400]  as you and I walked through that area and saw that and that was a very chilling
[1:38:42.400 --> 1:38:47.040]  thing as we walk through there and saw where they're training to fight in an
[1:38:47.040 --> 1:38:51.560]  American city they don't fight for scenarios that they don't anticipate
[1:38:51.560 --> 1:38:55.640]  using that's what they've been training for not only there at AP Hills we see if
[1:38:55.640 --> 1:38:59.000]  you're watching this footage that was the footage that we some of the footage
[1:38:59.000 --> 1:39:02.240]  that we shot there we actually walked through the facility they let us the
[1:39:02.240 --> 1:39:06.240]  security card let us in the guys who are running it were pretty upset I think
[1:39:06.240 --> 1:39:10.640]  with her after she let us in but that's that they're doing that there they're
[1:39:10.640 --> 1:39:15.000]  doing it down in Camp Lejeune in North Carolina they have a more rural setting
[1:39:15.000 --> 1:39:20.280]  down there they have another setting down in Georgia where we just had a video
[1:39:20.280 --> 1:39:24.840]  released from there where you could see them wargaming against black protesters
[1:39:24.840 --> 1:39:29.480]  exactly what we see happening in Ferguson Missouri they're training to use the military
[1:39:29.480 --> 1:39:33.000]  when I talk about it I'm crazy when I people tell me I'm crazy when I speak
[1:39:33.000 --> 1:39:37.840]  about the law and things like that and maybe it takes a Ferguson to happen for
[1:39:37.840 --> 1:39:41.120]  people to wake up but I'm telling you people are calling me now apologizing
[1:39:41.120 --> 1:39:45.080]  going oh my god I thought you were just you know out of your mind or something
[1:39:45.080 --> 1:39:49.120]  but I'm watching your live stream every night people are saying up till 3 in the
[1:39:49.120 --> 1:39:56.280]  morning with us because they're just so amazed at how this city is collapsing and
[1:39:56.280 --> 1:40:00.920]  how this police state is taking over and martial law going in effect and people
[1:40:00.920 --> 1:40:04.400]  losing their rights I did a drive around through the town last night just to
[1:40:04.400 --> 1:40:08.240]  show people what it was like it's not easy to get through even in the outskirts
[1:40:08.240 --> 1:40:12.920]  to please have it pushed back you can't go around the cops are just you know very
[1:40:12.920 --> 1:40:17.320]  mean very rude they won't give you any information they they try to funnel you
[1:40:17.320 --> 1:40:21.440]  down specific routes they pick so it gets you far away from anything going on
[1:40:21.440 --> 1:40:26.480]  it is just ridiculous what is going on here and people need to watch this stuff
[1:40:26.480 --> 1:40:30.320]  at night when we're filming it and to see the lawlessness and to see the
[1:40:30.320 --> 1:40:35.000]  complete and total collapse of what's going on because yes we saw them training
[1:40:35.000 --> 1:40:39.440]  for this we've been reporting about it for months now and now it is happening
[1:40:39.440 --> 1:40:44.320]  in real-time people in a world can actually see not just America's eyes the
[1:40:44.320 --> 1:40:48.920]  entire world is watching what's happening and what they see is disgusting
[1:40:48.920 --> 1:40:55.000]  the frequency the depth the in-your-face aspect of this is just increasing all the
[1:40:55.000 --> 1:40:59.480]  time Alex Jones has been talking about this since he started doing radio and
[1:40:59.480 --> 1:41:02.840]  documentaries for 20 years the John Birch Society has been talking about that
[1:41:02.840 --> 1:41:08.120]  even longer about the militarization of the police now it is all coming to a
[1:41:08.120 --> 1:41:12.200]  head now the gloves are coming off hopefully people will see this and
[1:41:12.200 --> 1:41:15.520]  we'll push back against this one of the articles that I was talking about
[1:41:15.520 --> 1:41:20.120]  earlier Joe was from the Washington Post and they were saying that back in June
[1:41:20.120 --> 1:41:25.280]  Alan Grayson tried to shut this program down that the Pentagon is using to
[1:41:25.280 --> 1:41:28.400]  militarize all the small police departments not just giving them MRAPs
[1:41:28.400 --> 1:41:32.200]  but giving them all kinds of surplus military equipment he wrote up an
[1:41:32.200 --> 1:41:38.000]  amendment Joe that even listed toxicological agents nuclear biological
[1:41:38.000 --> 1:41:42.120]  and chemical agents saying that we don't want any of this to be given to the
[1:41:42.120 --> 1:41:46.880]  police department yet eighty five percent of the Congress said no we will
[1:41:46.880 --> 1:41:50.760]  let them have any and all of that stuff so that's what people need to
[1:41:50.760 --> 1:41:53.480]  understand and the Washington Post article brought that up because they
[1:41:53.480 --> 1:41:58.080]  said now that people have seen how this is being used how these people have been
[1:41:58.080 --> 1:42:04.440]  how the police departments have been retrained redirected repurposed had
[1:42:04.440 --> 1:42:09.040]  their mission statement as you will changed by this federalization by this
[1:42:09.040 --> 1:42:13.120]  militarization now that people have seen that perhaps it'll be different perhaps
[1:42:13.120 --> 1:42:17.880]  now they can get this past get some kind of restrictions put on this
[1:42:17.880 --> 1:42:22.360]  militarization of the police you know the the first we got was here I saw the
[1:42:22.360 --> 1:42:27.200]  same Pete every day I got to know pretty much a good chunk of the community of
[1:42:27.200 --> 1:42:31.040]  Ferguson they were out there every day at this point they don't even come out
[1:42:31.040 --> 1:42:36.000]  anymore I spoke to a two two men who lived a few blocks from the main protest
[1:42:36.000 --> 1:42:39.080]  area and they they came out last night for the first time because they've been
[1:42:39.080 --> 1:42:41.960]  watching my live stream and they just wanted to come out and just say you
[1:42:41.960 --> 1:42:45.440]  know thanks for what you guys are doing but overall they said they don't leave
[1:42:45.440 --> 1:42:48.960]  their house anymore they've not been going to work they're scared to just move
[1:42:48.960 --> 1:42:55.440]  around and freely they feel like their their their life is you know at any time
[1:42:55.440 --> 1:43:00.560]  and just be gone and that's because I'm hot-headed cop and I truly believe that
[1:43:00.560 --> 1:43:03.800]  there are federal undercover agents working with this police force from the
[1:43:03.800 --> 1:43:07.200]  stuff that I've seen lately that has there has to be something like that
[1:43:07.200 --> 1:43:11.320]  going on it is just mind-blowing because it's a complete and total sigh up
[1:43:11.320 --> 1:43:16.920]  they're running they are trying to push this so they can bring in more military
[1:43:16.920 --> 1:43:21.480]  do this throughout the country that's why it's so key that you're there those
[1:43:21.480 --> 1:43:25.240]  people realize it as jacari Jackson pointed out they were telling people go
[1:43:25.240 --> 1:43:29.920]  home as as they were starting to gas and and the peaceful protesters and shoot
[1:43:29.920 --> 1:43:33.040]  rubber bullets at them they were telling them go back to your homes well they
[1:43:33.040 --> 1:43:37.120]  were shooting tear gas into the yards of the people who live there I mean where
[1:43:37.120 --> 1:43:41.320]  are they supposed to go they understand that yards exactly running through their
[1:43:41.320 --> 1:43:46.720]  yards knocking over fences and if you guys weren't there the mainstream media is
[1:43:46.720 --> 1:43:51.840]  basically pulled back with the police embedded it with the police listening to
[1:43:51.840 --> 1:43:55.800]  what the police are telling them not on the site where they can see anything and
[1:43:55.800 --> 1:43:59.600]  so they're just basically putting back the press releases that the police tell
[1:43:59.600 --> 1:44:02.160]  them about what's happening because they're not getting that eyewitness
[1:44:02.160 --> 1:44:06.120]  report but it is dangerous for you guys to be out there I know that from what
[1:44:06.120 --> 1:44:09.960]  Alex said it's very dangerous for you guys to be there so be very careful I
[1:44:09.960 --> 1:44:13.160]  know you've got to go now and get your equipment recharged because you said
[1:44:13.160 --> 1:44:16.480]  things really start happening at night you've got a lot of equipment that is
[1:44:16.480 --> 1:44:19.760]  we sent some equipment to you that you guys are there and St. Louis to pick up
[1:44:19.760 --> 1:44:23.000]  and you got to get stuff charged so I know you got to go any final words Joe

[1:44:47.840 --> 1:44:51.120]  we're not going to be able to stop us from happening and it's going to spread
[1:44:51.120 --> 1:44:56.960]  all over our nation absolutely well thank you Joe be very careful regards to
[1:44:56.960 --> 1:45:01.200]  Marcus Morales and Kit Daniels and Mikhail Thelan who are all there

[1:45:04.400 --> 1:45:09.400]  reports thank you all right bye bye you know we need to follow the money we
[1:45:09.400 --> 1:45:13.000]  need to take a look at what is driving this there's an article that's up on
[1:45:13.000 --> 1:45:17.280]  info wars today Congress members who approve the militarization of the US
[1:45:17.280 --> 1:45:22.920]  police receive 73% more money from the defense industry in other words as I
[1:45:22.920 --> 1:45:26.760]  put in the subtitle their Congress is for sale to the highest bidder this is
[1:45:26.760 --> 1:45:33.600]  a washington's blog article this is why 85% of the Congress would vote down the
[1:45:33.600 --> 1:45:38.760]  restrictions of handing things like toxicological agents nuclear biological
[1:45:38.760 --> 1:45:44.760]  chemical not to mention all the other lethal vehicles and weapons that they're
[1:45:44.760 --> 1:45:50.320]  giving to the police 85% of Congress is fine with that why because they get a
[1:45:50.320 --> 1:45:55.040]  lot of money from the defense industry and what is happening is we're seeing
[1:45:55.040 --> 1:46:01.520]  that the Pentagon is so bent on getting this equipment so quickly to the police
[1:46:01.520 --> 1:46:05.680]  departments that they're even withholding it from fire departments now I had
[1:46:05.680 --> 1:46:09.560]  somebody contact me and that's why we always appreciate you giving us tips
[1:46:09.560 --> 1:46:15.560]  saying that he had heard that the Pentagon was stopping the the giving of
[1:46:15.560 --> 1:46:19.800]  surplus equipment to fire departments could I look into that and it turns out
[1:46:19.800 --> 1:46:24.520]  that for a couple of weeks they actually did that this is a program the federal
[1:46:24.520 --> 1:46:30.280]  excess personal property FEPP and the firefighter property program FPP these
[1:46:30.280 --> 1:46:35.920]  have been in existence since 1956 as surplus military equipment came home
[1:46:35.920 --> 1:46:40.920]  from World War two they started giving it to fire departments primarily to small
[1:46:40.920 --> 1:46:46.560]  town rural fire departments who had a need for because they were on the spot
[1:46:46.560 --> 1:46:51.680]  when they had large wildfires that would happen out in the unpopulated areas and
[1:46:51.680 --> 1:46:54.800]  of course they had small towns they couldn't afford to buy a lot of equipment
[1:46:54.800 --> 1:46:58.160]  so basically what they would do is they would gift these vehicles to them they
[1:46:58.160 --> 1:47:03.160]  still paid 30 to 40 thousand dollars to modify the vehicles what happened is on
[1:47:03.160 --> 1:47:10.080]  June 19th the Defense Logistics Agency that's the Pentagon group the DLA which
[1:47:10.080 --> 1:47:15.400]  is basically giving all this equipment to the police departments said we're not
[1:47:15.400 --> 1:47:20.440]  going to do that for fire departments anymore after doing this from 1956 on
[1:47:20.440 --> 1:47:23.600]  they said we're just going to stop it we're not going to do that anymore and
[1:47:23.600 --> 1:47:27.760]  they said here's the reason we had this agreement with the EPA 25 years ago and
[1:47:27.760 --> 1:47:31.480]  we decided that we're going to now enforce it because the EPA was concerned
[1:47:31.480 --> 1:47:36.560]  about our vehicle emissions really you haven't enforced that for 25 years but
[1:47:36.560 --> 1:47:41.120]  all of a sudden you're going to start enforcing that rule now of course the
[1:47:41.120 --> 1:47:44.400]  absurdity is is that if you've got a wildfire that's going on and people don't
[1:47:44.400 --> 1:47:46.520]  have the kind of vehicles the firefighters don't have the kind of
[1:47:46.520 --> 1:47:50.520]  vehicles they need to put this out isn't that going to be a little bit more
[1:47:50.520 --> 1:47:55.320]  troubling for the atmosphere for the environment than the emissions from a
[1:47:55.320 --> 1:48:01.160]  couple of fire trucks as they reported in Indiana and in Oklahoma they said an
[1:48:01.160 --> 1:48:05.720]  Indiana twelve million dollars worth of surplus equipment is now on loan to more
[1:48:05.720 --> 1:48:10.560]  than 250 volunteer fire departments in Indiana Oklahoma said that they had
[1:48:10.560 --> 1:48:14.800]  over 8,000 vehicles and pieces of Department of Defense equipment that
[1:48:14.800 --> 1:48:18.480]  was valued at over a hundred and fifty million dollars being used by Oklahoma
[1:48:18.480 --> 1:48:22.360]  fire department so this was going to cripple them that's what one of the
[1:48:22.360 --> 1:48:26.600]  volunteer fire department said he said they are endangering lives with this
[1:48:26.600 --> 1:48:31.520]  decision the National Association of State Foresters said that by taking this
[1:48:31.520 --> 1:48:37.000]  out they were taking out the means of putting out about 83% of the wildfires
[1:48:37.000 --> 1:48:41.320]  because most of the wildfires are put out by local fire agencies so they were
[1:48:41.320 --> 1:48:46.040]  crippling these guys but what is it that the Defense Logistics Agency really
[1:48:46.040 --> 1:48:50.960]  wants to see if you look at their site if you look at the 1033 program this is
[1:48:50.960 --> 1:48:54.240]  what they're telling people they say we'll give you pretty much any kind of
[1:48:54.240 --> 1:48:58.680]  vehicle you want but you got to meet three qualifications number one is the
[1:48:58.680 --> 1:49:02.360]  agency's primary function the enforcement of law is the agency's
[1:49:02.360 --> 1:49:06.160]  officers primarily properly compensated and then here's the key thing
[1:49:06.160 --> 1:49:12.520]  number three do the agencies officers have the powers of arrest and apprehension
[1:49:12.520 --> 1:49:17.920]  see they have to have all three of those mainly they want people to have this
[1:49:17.920 --> 1:49:23.040]  militarized equipment if they can arrest and apprehend people so that's why they
[1:49:23.040 --> 1:49:26.280]  didn't want to give it to the fire departments even though we are told
[1:49:26.280 --> 1:49:29.640]  over and over again that hey if we have these m-rap vehicles if we have these
[1:49:29.640 --> 1:49:34.440]  bear cats we can help people during natural disasters that's not what they're
[1:49:34.440 --> 1:49:39.120]  looking for and as one person pointed out he said about 99% of military
[1:49:39.120 --> 1:49:43.120]  surplus doesn't even meet EPA emission standards he said that mission standards
[1:49:43.120 --> 1:49:46.920]  is something government doesn't worry about on a battlefield that's the key
[1:49:46.920 --> 1:49:51.320]  that's the key because when they got pushed back from the senators from the
[1:49:51.320 --> 1:49:55.080]  congressmen and they backed down the first week of July about two weeks after
[1:49:55.080 --> 1:50:00.320]  this had happened they said we're going to loan it to the fire departments we're
[1:50:00.320 --> 1:50:03.680]  not going to give it to them so that will make the EPA happy because we'll
[1:50:03.680 --> 1:50:08.680]  say that it still belongs to the Pentagon it's still here for military use so
[1:50:08.680 --> 1:50:13.280]  it's exempt now do you understand they're giving it to the police departments
[1:50:13.280 --> 1:50:18.040]  but they have to loan it to the fire departments because if it's not used for
[1:50:18.040 --> 1:50:22.960]  military purposes then the EPA gets upset about it in other words they're
[1:50:22.960 --> 1:50:28.240]  admitting that the police are being militarized with their equipment that
[1:50:28.240 --> 1:50:33.040]  they're part of the military that's why they have to loan it to the firemen but
[1:50:33.040 --> 1:50:38.600]  of course if you were listening to what I said this equipment is on loan all the
[1:50:38.600 --> 1:50:43.640]  all the documents the news reports we're talking about how that fire
[1:50:43.640 --> 1:50:49.040]  equipment was loaned so that was just smoke screen to cover this up say what

[1:54:35.320 --> 1:54:39.040]  hour but I had promised earlier that we're going to have some Kardashian news
[1:54:39.040 --> 1:54:44.280]  and even though we have cities that are burning down and we see our government
[1:54:44.280 --> 1:54:48.600]  moving to martial law talking about how they're going to shoot peaceful
[1:54:48.600 --> 1:54:52.840]  protesters you know we still are concerned about what's going on in
[1:54:52.840 --> 1:54:57.000]  social media aren't we just as Joe Biggs talked about these young trendy girls
[1:54:57.000 --> 1:55:01.080]  out there coming on the site just because they hear it's in the news and so
[1:55:01.080 --> 1:55:04.120]  they want to be a part of it I maybe that's why the Kardashians wanted to go
[1:55:04.120 --> 1:55:10.360]  to Plum Island and they say that that was been nixed by Homeland Security now
[1:55:10.360 --> 1:55:15.200]  for those of you who don't know Plum Island is a as I point out in this
[1:55:15.200 --> 1:55:20.840]  article from Newsday that it is the site of a high-security animal disease
[1:55:20.840 --> 1:55:26.160]  research lab now Plum Island is just off of the island Long Island in New York
[1:55:26.160 --> 1:55:31.080]  and it's a very secure area very secretive and as the Homeland Security
[1:55:31.080 --> 1:55:35.080]  Public Affairs officer said he said we really regret that we didn't have
[1:55:35.080 --> 1:55:39.560]  enough time to do background checks on the Kardashians because we want to
[1:55:39.560 --> 1:55:43.720]  dispel the mythos of what's going on in this island they say it's popular and
[1:55:43.720 --> 1:55:48.280]  fun to have conspiracy theories about a secret government lab on an island but
[1:55:48.280 --> 1:55:52.080]  we want people to understand exactly what we do we don't want people to be
[1:55:52.080 --> 1:55:56.240]  afraid of us that's right you know you could probably visit DARPA if you gave
[1:55:56.240 --> 1:56:01.040]  them enough advanced notice you probably wouldn't learn anything and I doubt
[1:56:01.040 --> 1:56:04.000]  that the Kardashians would learn anything if they went to Plum Island
[1:56:04.000 --> 1:56:10.040]  many people have made a case that what we see now with Lyme disease which of
[1:56:10.040 --> 1:56:14.280]  course is put out by ticks that essentially started up in the northeast
[1:56:14.280 --> 1:56:17.920]  not far from Plum Island many people believe that that was something that
[1:56:17.920 --> 1:56:22.920]  was either escaped accidentally or was put out there as a test by the federal
[1:56:22.920 --> 1:56:27.600]  government as a disease that spread from that area of course that would never
[1:56:27.600 --> 1:56:31.480]  happen would it the government would never let something dangerous like that
[1:56:31.480 --> 1:56:35.520]  get out of their care just like they wouldn't let Ebola get out of their care
[1:56:35.520 --> 1:56:39.320]  that's why they sent the people who were sick with Ebola they brought them back
[1:56:39.320 --> 1:56:44.360]  and put them in a level two facility instead of a level four with which is
[1:56:44.360 --> 1:56:48.360]  the most secure we just had news that broke last week and we didn't cover
[1:56:48.360 --> 1:56:52.800]  this because so much has been happening in Ferguson about the CDC say that a
[1:56:52.800 --> 1:56:57.760]  scientist took shortcuts handling a deadly bird flu virus a deadly stranded
[1:56:57.760 --> 1:57:02.280]  bird flu virus they say an investigation into the mistaken shipment of deadly
[1:57:02.280 --> 1:57:05.880]  bird flu virus from a government lab earlier this year found that a scientist
[1:57:05.880 --> 1:57:10.480]  took shortcuts in order to speed up his work he accidentally contaminated the
[1:57:10.480 --> 1:57:15.160]  samples as a result they shipped a virulent avian flu virus rather than a
[1:57:15.160 --> 1:57:19.240]  relatively benign strain to a poultry research lab of the Department of
[1:57:19.240 --> 1:57:25.280]  Agriculture no one became infected or fell ill this time and the pathogen was
[1:57:25.280 --> 1:57:29.000]  destroyed but after CDC lab members learned of the safety lapse they didn't
[1:57:29.000 --> 1:57:33.520]  notify supervisors up the chain of command until more than six weeks later
[1:57:33.520 --> 1:57:38.320]  see things like that can happen you know the Lyme disease could have escaped
[1:57:38.320 --> 1:57:41.080]  from there even if they didn't deliberately do that we have another
[1:57:41.080 --> 1:57:45.680]  story that's been percolating and I first thought about a year ago about this
[1:57:45.680 --> 1:57:51.440]  other tick disease that creates a meat allergy of people this is a lone star
[1:57:51.440 --> 1:57:56.840]  tick now it doesn't come from Texas even though they appear it appears to sound
[1:57:56.840 --> 1:58:01.560]  that way it actually is named that because of the design on the back of
[1:58:01.560 --> 1:58:06.600]  the tick what happens is when you get bit with this tick there is a sugar that
[1:58:06.600 --> 1:58:11.240]  enters your blood system your immune system reacts to that and creates an
[1:58:11.240 --> 1:58:15.920]  allergic reaction whenever you have meat this is something that also is
[1:58:15.920 --> 1:58:20.080]  starting to affect a lot of people this is something that also started up in the
[1:58:20.080 --> 1:58:25.520]  Long Island and Northeast area and moving down in Virginia into the Atlantic
[1:58:25.520 --> 1:58:30.440]  Coast states this is looking like the same type of thing we saw with Lyme
[1:58:30.440 --> 1:58:35.040]  disease very troubling to see that and very troubling to see a darker research
[1:58:35.040 --> 1:58:39.560]  project to track another disease hundred and fifty thousand dollars will be

[2:00:45.040 --> 2:00:51.280]  that North America is what comes after America they are moving to the next level
[2:00:51.280 --> 2:00:55.280]  they're trying to join the North American Union which is what they see now
[2:00:55.280 --> 2:00:59.640]  no longer seeing America Mexico Canada they see the North American Union
[2:00:59.640 --> 2:01:02.920]  they're trying to join that with the European Union with the transatlantic
[2:01:02.920 --> 2:01:08.120]  partnership with the Asian trade group so the trans Pacific partnership very
[2:01:08.120 --> 2:01:12.040]  troubling implications of that and of course it's being sold to us as free
[2:01:12.040 --> 2:01:15.840]  trade it's going to be a very interesting discussion with the CEO of the
[2:01:15.840 --> 2:01:21.160]  John Burt society before we get to that I wanted to play for you a little bit of
[2:01:21.160 --> 2:01:26.000]  the founder of the John Burt society Robert Welsh we have a short clip here
[2:01:26.000 --> 2:01:30.400]  to give you a feel for if you've never heard this man to give you a feel for
[2:01:30.400 --> 2:01:35.320]  what he said a few years quite a few years ago let's go that clip of which
[2:01:35.320 --> 2:01:40.640]  the United Nations is the outstanding but far from the only example here are
[2:01:40.640 --> 2:01:48.720]  the aims for the United States one greatly expanded government spending for
[2:01:48.720 --> 2:01:54.720]  every conceivable means of getting rid of ever larger sums of American money as
[2:01:54.720 --> 2:02:02.600]  wastefully as possible to hire and then much higher taxes three and
[2:02:02.600 --> 2:02:09.320]  increasingly unbalanced budget despite the higher taxes this is 1958 that he's
[2:02:09.320 --> 2:02:15.840]  saying wild inflation of our currency five government controls of prices
[2:02:15.840 --> 2:02:23.040]  wages and materials supposedly to combat inflation six greatly increased
[2:02:23.040 --> 2:02:28.920]  socialistic controls over every operation of our economy and every activity of our
[2:02:28.920 --> 2:02:33.880]  daily lives this is to be accompanied naturally and automatically by a
[2:02:33.880 --> 2:02:38.920]  correspondingly huge increase in the size of our bureaucracy and in both the
[2:02:38.920 --> 2:02:46.120]  cost and reach of our domestic government seven far more centralization of
[2:02:46.120 --> 2:02:52.760]  power in Washington and the practical elimination of our state lines there is
[2:02:52.760 --> 2:02:57.960]  a many faceted drive at work to have our state lines eventually mean no more
[2:02:57.960 --> 2:03:04.920]  within the nation than our county lines do now within the states eight they
[2:03:04.920 --> 2:03:09.800]  study advance of federal aid to and control over our educational system
[2:03:09.800 --> 2:03:16.960]  leading to complete federalization of our public education nine a constant
[2:03:16.960 --> 2:03:21.680]  hammering into the American consciousness of the horror of modern
[2:03:21.680 --> 2:03:27.920]  warfare the beauties and the absolute necessity of peace peace always on
[2:03:27.920 --> 2:03:34.120]  communist terms of course and ten the consequent willingness of the American
[2:03:34.120 --> 2:03:39.080]  people to allow the steps of appeasement by our government which amount to a
[2:03:39.080 --> 2:03:44.920]  piecemeal surrender of the rest of a free world and of the United States itself
[2:03:44.920 --> 2:03:49.720]  that's a speech by Robert Welch decades ago notice one of the things he said
[2:03:49.720 --> 2:03:54.160]  there I kind of struck me he said state lines would become meaningless well you
[2:03:54.160 --> 2:03:58.800]  know what international lines have become meaningless in the wake of NAFTA
[2:03:58.800 --> 2:04:02.200]  just as we had Nancy Pelosi go to the border and say we have one community we
[2:04:02.200 --> 2:04:06.280]  just happen to have a border running through it and of course that border is
[2:04:06.280 --> 2:04:11.440]  just as meaningless as the border running between Texas and Oklahoma as far as
[2:04:11.440 --> 2:04:15.080]  Nancy Pelosi is concerned so that's what we're looking at here we're going to be
[2:04:15.080 --> 2:04:19.600]  talking to Arthur Thompson about the implications and the methods of how
[2:04:19.600 --> 2:04:23.160]  they're doing this they're basically setting up these regional trading zones
[2:04:23.160 --> 2:04:27.680]  and then now they're at the stage where they are joining these together very
[2:04:27.680 --> 2:04:31.560]  troubling what they're doing pushing through things that they could not get
[2:04:31.560 --> 2:04:36.360]  through like Syspa, Sopha, Acta, Pippa they're pushing through that through the
[2:04:36.360 --> 2:04:39.960]  trade agreements as they merge the different states together so join us
[2:04:39.960 --> 2:04:42.680]  right after the break we're going to be back with Arthur Thompson from the

[2:08:25.400 --> 2:08:29.520]  Arthur Thompson thank you so much for coming in and talking to us you're here
[2:08:29.520 --> 2:08:34.040]  in the area because you've got a meeting tomorrow night that far noon at
[2:08:34.040 --> 2:08:38.880]  Christie's restaurant okay Houston yeah yes and that's what's the real price of
[2:08:38.880 --> 2:08:42.480]  free trade is a subject there yes it is yeah and you'll be talking about your
[2:08:42.480 --> 2:08:47.560]  new book which is international merger by foreign entanglement well that's you
[2:08:47.560 --> 2:08:52.080]  got a copy right there and we can see that yes that's exactly what's going on
[2:08:52.080 --> 2:08:56.000]  isn't it we've had this amazing clip and and we'll play that in a second but
[2:08:56.000 --> 2:09:00.000]  yeah tell us exactly what's happening now as people are seeing the effects of
[2:09:00.000 --> 2:09:04.360]  NAFTA it's another level that they're already working on as we see what's
[2:09:04.360 --> 2:09:08.760]  happening well that's right they work at many levels they do very a number of
[2:09:08.760 --> 2:09:14.480]  different things they have an agenda each agenda has it's like a mosaic if you
[2:09:14.480 --> 2:09:18.480]  will there's a tile in that mosaic this is one of those tiles but a very
[2:09:18.480 --> 2:09:23.960]  important one that fits their agenda and basically they are trying to merge the
[2:09:23.960 --> 2:09:28.320]  United States into a new world order as we all know but they do it through
[2:09:28.320 --> 2:09:33.360]  various means for instance they use the NAFTA to be the the platform if you will
[2:09:33.360 --> 2:09:39.000]  for a North American Union now they want to use the transatlantic trade and
[2:09:39.000 --> 2:09:43.800]  investment partnership to do the same thing only to merge us with the European
[2:09:43.800 --> 2:09:49.920]  Union I actually was there when the wall came down in Berlin wow and I was over
[2:09:49.920 --> 2:09:56.240]  there doing a research on what was going to happen next one of the guys that I
[2:09:56.240 --> 2:10:02.360]  met with was the public relations officer in Bonn Germany for the EC just
[2:10:02.360 --> 2:10:07.200]  that was the you know European community just before they named it the EU he
[2:10:07.200 --> 2:10:12.360]  looked me in the eye and and we were as a closest this in his office in Bonn and
[2:10:12.360 --> 2:10:17.480]  he said you know we're going to be bigger than you geographically population and
[2:10:17.480 --> 2:10:21.480]  economically and we're going to drag you into this union whether you like it or
[2:10:21.480 --> 2:10:25.200]  not kicking and screaming wow and I sat there and I said oh wait a minute I'm
[2:10:25.200 --> 2:10:29.840]  here representing the new American magazine certainly the Washington Post
[2:10:29.840 --> 2:10:34.560]  has been here the New York Times why aren't they reporting on this he must be
[2:10:34.560 --> 2:10:39.440]  saying the same thing to them and he was doing so very arrogantly this to him
[2:10:39.440 --> 2:10:46.000]  was a done deal it was not if but when and so that's their plan a lot of people
[2:10:46.000 --> 2:10:49.080]  are very concerned about the Trans-Pacific Partnership about the
[2:10:49.080 --> 2:10:53.920]  transatlantic partnerships mainly because of the way they're being
[2:10:53.920 --> 2:10:57.960]  negotiated I think a lot of people are looking at this and saying why do we have
[2:10:57.960 --> 2:11:04.600]  our elected representatives not even allowed to read the transcripts unless
[2:11:04.600 --> 2:11:07.760]  they sign a nondisclosure they can't take it with them you know they can go
[2:11:07.760 --> 2:11:10.880]  there with their staff a couple of them have been all graciously allowed to see
[2:11:10.880 --> 2:11:15.480]  this but it is completely shut off from the elected representatives and you have
[2:11:15.480 --> 2:11:19.600]  to look at this you have to say what are they afraid of us seeing in this and
[2:11:19.600 --> 2:11:22.800]  of course some of it has leaked out and we know that it is not just about
[2:11:22.800 --> 2:11:27.840]  economic issues it's about fundamental freedom issues like control of the
[2:11:27.840 --> 2:11:31.600]  internet they've tried many times to ram these things through been defeated in
[2:11:31.600 --> 2:11:36.240]  the democratic process trying to get syspa so pa acta pipa through both the
[2:11:36.240 --> 2:11:39.480]  United States and in Europe and so now they're going to do it in the back door
[2:11:39.480 --> 2:11:42.720]  with a trade agreement amongst other things that amongst other things even
[2:11:42.720 --> 2:11:48.280]  the bill Bill writes yes I'll show you an example of that in a moment but that's
[2:11:48.280 --> 2:11:52.280]  what they do you know it's sort of the philosophy we got to pass it to find out
[2:11:52.280 --> 2:11:59.640]  what's in it yeah people who do know outside of the main negotiating teams
[2:11:59.640 --> 2:12:02.840]  and that's what they called shareholders yes and these are the
[2:12:02.840 --> 2:12:07.000]  international bankers and the multinational corporations and so they
[2:12:07.000 --> 2:12:11.960]  get their sweetheart deals so they can compete in this market but the little
[2:12:11.960 --> 2:12:16.960]  guy in the medium-sized businessman cannot and they're shoved out so what
[2:12:16.960 --> 2:12:21.680]  you see is more smaller and medium-sized businesses going out of business and
[2:12:21.680 --> 2:12:26.480]  banks as well the smaller banks the privately owned banks that sort of thing
[2:12:26.480 --> 2:12:30.840]  hundreds of banks were failing in the years after the bailout of the largest
[2:12:30.840 --> 2:12:33.840]  banks the dredge was putting it up you know another hundred and forty another
[2:12:33.840 --> 2:12:36.000]  hundred and seventy failed this year
[2:12:36.000 --> 2:12:40.560]  driving out all their competition while they get massive subsidies from the
[2:12:40.560 --> 2:12:43.840]  government that they can then event they eventually said well we paid it all
[2:12:43.840 --> 2:12:49.080]  back of course I got a zero percent interest loan to pay it not too hard to
[2:12:49.080 --> 2:12:52.080]  do that they're even talking about a negative interest rate yeah some
[2:12:52.080 --> 2:12:56.720]  instance absolutely amazing now as we said some of the things that they're
[2:12:56.720 --> 2:13:00.120]  trying to run through with this of course as they come against these smaller
[2:13:00.120 --> 2:13:03.800]  businesses who don't have any protection they're allowing the largest
[2:13:03.800 --> 2:13:08.480]  corporations to essentially be elevated to the level of sovereign
[2:13:08.480 --> 2:13:12.200]  governments in a kind of you know whenever they have a trade dispute
[2:13:12.200 --> 2:13:17.600]  talk about that a little bit well the thing is that what they do in these
[2:13:17.600 --> 2:13:23.760]  instances is to make it so that only one entity can compete or actually function
[2:13:23.760 --> 2:13:29.000]  in these areas and we have a number of people that have that manage these
[2:13:29.000 --> 2:13:33.360]  things that are members of the council on foreign relations but also people that
[2:13:33.360 --> 2:13:38.680]  are are deprived of real good education relative to what freedom means what what
[2:13:38.680 --> 2:13:42.840]  the free enterprise is and everything else so they're very happy with these
[2:13:42.840 --> 2:13:46.880]  things they're gonna have us a cushy job they're gonna make more money than the
[2:13:46.880 --> 2:13:50.960]  next guy and they don't have any comprehension of what they're doing to
[2:13:50.960 --> 2:13:56.160]  their own country and ultimately their own family these people by the way if
[2:13:56.160 --> 2:13:59.880]  they form and I don't think they'll be able to do it I think we can stop them
[2:13:59.880 --> 2:14:04.880]  but if they form a new world order these are the people that will be eliminated
[2:14:04.880 --> 2:14:10.680]  from the system first yes yes because what they do is they're giving power to
[2:14:10.680 --> 2:14:15.600]  these companies to function but see what they don't understand is that the power
[2:14:15.600 --> 2:14:21.240]  is really in the government now yes they allow these companies to go forward and
[2:14:21.240 --> 2:14:24.760]  do what they're doing but the power really is in the government itself
[2:14:24.760 --> 2:14:28.960]  ultimately when they only have one company doing this and one company doing
[2:14:28.960 --> 2:14:32.560]  that they'll just come in and nationalize them and take it over let me
[2:14:32.560 --> 2:14:37.800]  give an example of of something that I like to use when it comes to power a lot
[2:14:37.800 --> 2:14:42.160]  of people things money it's nothing to do with my Hitler Stalin Mao none of
[2:14:42.160 --> 2:14:46.120]  these people were rich they were poor off the streets when they got that power
[2:14:46.120 --> 2:14:51.560]  they didn't want for anything let's take an example of today let's say that
[2:14:51.560 --> 2:14:57.280]  David Rockefeller walked into the studio and told you to cut my throat you
[2:14:57.280 --> 2:15:01.960]  wouldn't do it you'd get on 911 and say there's a nutcase here come and get him
[2:15:01.960 --> 2:15:07.040]  it's probably on SSRI but but he's got a lot of retainers so obviously he
[2:15:07.040 --> 2:15:11.320]  wouldn't be at the county jail very long but that kind of money that he has
[2:15:11.320 --> 2:15:15.040]  doesn't give him enough power to tell you what to do because you're a moral
[2:15:15.040 --> 2:15:21.480]  man now if we were in 1950 in Beijing China and Mao Zedong walked in here
[2:15:21.480 --> 2:15:25.680]  and told you to cut my throat you knew you had two choices yours or mine
[2:15:25.680 --> 2:15:31.080]  mm-hmm that's power money can't buy that power in a moral people and that's
[2:15:31.080 --> 2:15:36.120]  what's being built is this this kind of power it looks like money in the
[2:15:36.120 --> 2:15:40.560]  beginning but it really isn't it is an accumulation in the government itself
[2:15:40.560 --> 2:15:44.640]  this is something that's been going on a long time and of course we played it
[2:15:44.640 --> 2:15:48.960]  this clip and I want to go to that clip you guys got that ready from Petraeus
[2:15:48.960 --> 2:15:55.280]  and Pelosi this is something we played many times and I think this really lays
[2:15:55.280 --> 2:15:59.000]  it out here we are 20 years in the North American Union and let's play that
[2:15:59.000 --> 2:16:02.360]  clip what Nancy Pelosi and David Petraeus have just said
[2:16:02.360 --> 2:16:07.960]  anyone who comes here sees that this is a community with a border going through
[2:16:07.960 --> 2:16:14.000]  it boldly proclaimed the coming North American decades as the title now it's
[2:16:14.000 --> 2:16:20.080]  founded on recognition that if you put these three economies together as has
[2:16:20.080 --> 2:16:23.880]  been the case 20 years into the North American Free Trade Act implementation
[2:16:23.880 --> 2:16:32.000]  you find unique countries in terms of demographics we're all Americans in this
[2:16:32.000 --> 2:16:37.960]  hemisphere North and South America and this crisis that some call a crisis we
[2:16:37.960 --> 2:16:42.040]  have to view as an opportunity there you go the crisis is always an
[2:16:42.040 --> 2:16:45.800]  opportunity but what David Petraeus was talking about he answered his own
[2:16:45.800 --> 2:16:50.480]  question what comes after America he says North America well what comes after
[2:16:50.480 --> 2:16:55.040]  North America is as you pointed out the Globalist Union and that's why it is so
[2:16:55.040 --> 2:16:59.240]  important for us to get people educated about what is happening with the
[2:16:59.240 --> 2:17:03.000]  Trans-Pacific Partnership as well as the Transatlantic Partnership they're now
[2:17:03.000 --> 2:17:08.320]  consolidating these regional economies together into a global regime we are
[2:17:08.320 --> 2:17:13.560]  being integrated in our economy and if people really go online and look for
[2:17:13.560 --> 2:17:20.280]  this economic integration situation you will find that for instance a few years
[2:17:20.280 --> 2:17:25.920]  ago George H. W. Bush assigned an agreement with Putin saying that we are
[2:17:25.920 --> 2:17:30.480]  now partners in all sense of the term that we are going to integrate our
[2:17:30.480 --> 2:17:35.960]  economies and then Clinton followed it up with one of the with the same sort of
[2:17:35.960 --> 2:17:41.200]  partnership agreement and then H. George W. followed it up again to reaffirm
[2:17:41.200 --> 2:17:45.800]  this thing if you go online and you start to look at Boeing and Lockheed
[2:17:45.800 --> 2:17:53.520]  companies of that nature let's see another one's GE you'll see that that
[2:17:53.520 --> 2:17:59.840]  the integration of the process of manufacturing is is very high for
[2:17:59.840 --> 2:18:05.640]  instance we cannot produce an airplane of any size in this country any longer
[2:18:05.640 --> 2:18:09.800]  without the Chinese and Russians supplying us the parts particularly
[2:18:09.800 --> 2:18:15.680]  titanium parts we see that Lockheed is is working with them now on nuclear
[2:18:15.680 --> 2:18:22.520]  projects they're working with the EU on and China on manned space projects now
[2:18:22.520 --> 2:18:27.720]  I kind of worry a little bit about that when I see a potential enemy working
[2:18:27.720 --> 2:18:32.560]  with our own companies on things that will be a detriment to us in time of
[2:18:32.560 --> 2:18:37.360]  war the secrets that they will learn the very fact that we will not be able to
[2:18:37.360 --> 2:18:41.720]  manufacture the things that we need to manufacture to win a war well what you
[2:18:41.720 --> 2:18:46.680]  have with that is you have a corporation which has bits and pieces of
[2:18:46.680 --> 2:18:49.600]  everything that you need being made in these different countries so not any
[2:18:49.600 --> 2:18:54.800]  one individual country has the power that say GE does because they are the
[2:18:54.800 --> 2:18:57.680]  ones who can make this happen for anybody or stop it from happening that's
[2:18:57.680 --> 2:19:02.160]  true the more disturbing aspect however it is that they're moving their R&D
[2:19:02.160 --> 2:19:07.200]  their research and development their general motors has even said that they're
[2:19:07.200 --> 2:19:13.240]  going to do all their R&D now in China Boeing does Lockheed does all these
[2:19:13.240 --> 2:19:20.840]  various firms are doing their R&D in in Russia and China or both I guess I look
[2:19:20.840 --> 2:19:26.240]  at this too and as we see the rise of robots of artificial intelligence as we
[2:19:26.240 --> 2:19:31.280]  see them taking over different aspects it's not just that our manufacturing
[2:19:31.280 --> 2:19:35.560]  base has been put into China for the most part but now we see that they're
[2:19:35.560 --> 2:19:39.200]  going to be competing even with people in service industries here so the
[2:19:39.200 --> 2:19:43.960]  question is what do we do when the robots are driving everybody everywhere
[2:19:43.960 --> 2:19:48.640]  doing everyone's service for them what do they need us for and of course many
[2:19:48.640 --> 2:19:51.720]  of them has said they don't need us and they have a plan for that as well we
[2:19:51.720 --> 2:19:54.200]  got to go to a commercial break we're going to be right back with Arthur

[2:24:13.440 --> 2:24:17.760]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight here in Austin we have
[2:24:17.760 --> 2:24:22.320]  joining us live in the studio Arthur Thompson CEO of the John Birch Society
[2:24:22.320 --> 2:24:25.600]  just before we went to break Mr. Thompson you were talking about how the
[2:24:25.600 --> 2:24:30.680]  multinational corporations are essentially moving bits and pieces of
[2:24:30.680 --> 2:24:35.760]  critical industries amongst the different countries so that nothing is
[2:24:35.760 --> 2:24:39.480]  is made entirely within one country and we were talking during the break about
[2:24:39.480 --> 2:24:42.640]  Boeing tell the tell the people about what's going on with that in our defense
[2:24:42.640 --> 2:24:48.640]  industry well Boeing is cooperating with the aircraft industry in China to help
[2:24:48.640 --> 2:24:54.000]  them manufacture parts that are competitive on the world market for
[2:24:54.000 --> 2:24:58.120]  military aircraft and that sort of thing particularly for the Chinese new
[2:24:58.120 --> 2:25:04.080]  fighter and the operation of the Chinese carrier you know the Chinese have a
[2:25:04.080 --> 2:25:08.320]  carrier now and so the aircraft that operate on that the Boeing's working
[2:25:08.320 --> 2:25:14.440]  with them to upgrade those things so that should help the the the feelings of
[2:25:14.440 --> 2:25:19.240]  the Filipinos and the Japanese and the Vietnamese you know feel real good about
[2:25:19.240 --> 2:25:22.840]  that sort of thing and and don't think for a minute they don't know that's
[2:25:22.840 --> 2:25:29.400]  going on and so they look at us you know with at a at a at an a scant's look if
[2:25:29.400 --> 2:25:33.000]  you will because wait a minute you're our friend here but then you're helping
[2:25:33.000 --> 2:25:37.960]  our enemy there just like something else is going on right now I think that the
[2:25:37.960 --> 2:25:42.280]  listeners really need to know about and it's a little off-subject but something
[2:25:42.280 --> 2:25:45.440]  has been worrying me and I got it confirmed in the front page of the
[2:25:45.440 --> 2:25:51.080]  Wall Street Journal on Monday and that is that in order to fight ISIS we're
[2:25:51.080 --> 2:25:55.880]  helping another terrorist organization you see because the the Kurdish Workers
[2:25:55.880 --> 2:26:00.560]  Party and the Democrat Party in the in Kurdistan were started by Russia they
[2:26:00.560 --> 2:26:05.520]  use the hammer and sickle on their flag for years lately they've been trying to
[2:26:05.520 --> 2:26:10.320]  obfuscate as to what they really stand for but now they're but they're on the
[2:26:10.320 --> 2:26:14.920]  terrorist watch list okay oh yeah so we're helping one terrorist group on
[2:26:14.920 --> 2:26:18.760]  the watch list to fight another terrorist group that's right and then we're
[2:26:18.760 --> 2:26:22.240]  probably equipping both of the actually we've we've have been equipping and
[2:26:22.240 --> 2:26:25.720]  training both sides of these things for quite some time and Syria they were
[2:26:25.720 --> 2:26:29.360]  killing and beheading Christians before they got together and gave themselves a
[2:26:29.360 --> 2:26:33.760]  new name and went across the border into Iraq so yeah it's exactly the way
[2:26:33.760 --> 2:26:37.160]  this thing rolls out well talking about these trade agreements I mean these
[2:26:37.160 --> 2:26:43.320]  things are really kind of Trojan horses for a whole slew of different issues
[2:26:43.320 --> 2:26:46.200]  sure one of the things of course you what we were talking about was the UN
[2:26:46.200 --> 2:26:49.960]  Declaration of Human Rights getting put in just as we're talking about putting
[2:26:49.960 --> 2:26:53.080]  in these controls of the internet through the back door calling them copyright
[2:26:53.080 --> 2:26:57.720]  violations they can essentially put anything into these trade agreements
[2:26:57.720 --> 2:27:02.040]  they're being negotiated in secret by corporate representatives and our
[2:27:02.040 --> 2:27:05.240]  elected representatives are not allowed to even see this stuff that's right you
[2:27:05.240 --> 2:27:08.800]  got to pass it in a week yeah you don't have time to read it one of the things I
[2:27:08.800 --> 2:27:13.560]  have here from the European Commission for instance is the trade policy
[2:27:13.560 --> 2:27:18.240]  committee of how to handle the the CETA agreement the Canadian European trade
[2:27:18.240 --> 2:27:23.680]  agreement and right here after a few pages they say that they refer reaffirmed
[2:27:23.680 --> 2:27:28.360]  their strong attachment to democracy and to fundamental rights is laid down in
[2:27:28.360 --> 2:27:32.360]  the Universal Declaration of Human Rights so they slip this thing into the
[2:27:32.360 --> 2:27:38.680]  treaty and these are actually not the Bill of Rights as you and I and America
[2:27:38.680 --> 2:27:43.320]  believes in the Bill of Rights that come from God these are rights given us by
[2:27:43.320 --> 2:27:47.680]  the United Nations yeah and then they have stipulations about how they can
[2:27:47.680 --> 2:27:51.680]  take them away you have freedom of speech as long as it isn't against the
[2:27:51.680 --> 2:27:55.880]  purposes and principles of the United Nations freedom of assembly as long as
[2:27:55.880 --> 2:27:59.520]  it's not against the purposes and principles of the United Nations so
[2:27:59.520 --> 2:28:03.920]  they're not really rights at all they're really a list of privileges that they
[2:28:03.920 --> 2:28:08.120]  grant to you temporarily and can take away at any point that they want it's
[2:28:08.120 --> 2:28:11.360]  not a fundamental if it doesn't come from God if it's being given to you by
[2:28:11.360 --> 2:28:15.480]  some government somewhere some political organization then they can take
[2:28:15.480 --> 2:28:19.480]  those rights at any point under any pretense true and in fact and some of
[2:28:19.480 --> 2:28:22.880]  them they have an exception for instance on the freedom of assembly that any
[2:28:22.880 --> 2:28:29.520]  dictator can run a car through and and so they just want to control the people
[2:28:29.520 --> 2:28:33.720]  but in the but they make people think that they've got their own they've got
[2:28:33.720 --> 2:28:37.120]  rights they make people think that they've got free elections and and that
[2:28:37.120 --> 2:28:42.920]  sort of thing we just had a study on on elections under dictators most people
[2:28:42.920 --> 2:28:46.880]  don't know that they did have elections in Nazi Germany and in and
[2:28:46.880 --> 2:28:50.600]  under Stalin and how they were manipulated to where the people thought
[2:28:50.600 --> 2:28:55.800]  that they had a free vote but really did not and it's and we're starting to see
[2:28:55.800 --> 2:29:01.400]  that now creep into the voting system oh yes states yes we've we've discussed
[2:29:01.400 --> 2:29:05.200]  many times the people who follow this very carefully there's so many different
[2:29:05.200 --> 2:29:09.080]  ways that you can control an election you can control who gets on the ballot
[2:29:09.080 --> 2:29:12.520]  you can control who gets into the debates as we've seen over and over again
[2:29:12.520 --> 2:29:16.880]  and then of course whoever counts the votes whoever registers the voters
[2:29:16.880 --> 2:29:21.560]  whoever has custody of the votes whoever reports this I mean you can get into
[2:29:21.560 --> 2:29:25.320]  that system in so many different ways that's what's so troubling about it and
[2:29:25.320 --> 2:29:30.720]  we can't even address voter ID without being called racist we're gonna get into
[2:29:30.720 --> 2:29:37.040]  some more of what's happening with the UN trying to impose police local police
[2:29:37.040 --> 2:29:39.520]  controls on us and some of the things that you were just telling me during the
[2:29:39.520 --> 2:29:43.040]  break we'll be right back we're talking to Arthur Thompson CEO of the John
[2:29:43.040 --> 2:29:50.480]  Birch Society stay with us we'll be right back we're on the March the
[2:29:50.480 --> 2:29:57.600]  Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[2:29:59.720 --> 2:30:05.120]  from the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself our world is

[2:33:14.640 --> 2:33:21.040]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight here in Austin I have
[2:33:21.040 --> 2:33:25.360]  joining me in the studio Arthur Thompson CEO of the John Birch Society and we
[2:33:25.360 --> 2:33:29.040]  were just talking about a new American article earlier in the program we're
[2:33:29.040 --> 2:33:32.240]  talking about what's happening in Ferguson Missouri and how the people
[2:33:32.240 --> 2:33:38.400]  there are so compliant and and and to the federal government's involvement and
[2:33:38.400 --> 2:33:42.120]  they think that the federal government coming in is going to solve it even to
[2:33:42.120 --> 2:33:46.280]  the extent that it now opens up the door for the UN to get involved and we've
[2:33:46.280 --> 2:33:51.120]  seen the secretary general come out and start talking about setting up UN
[2:33:51.120 --> 2:33:57.920]  standards for local police in fact I talk about it in my book on on actually
[2:33:57.920 --> 2:34:05.720]  on page 68 it it shows that the major of the Baltimore Police Department attended
[2:34:05.720 --> 2:34:14.280]  a United Nations conference on UN standards for for police and they call
[2:34:14.280 --> 2:34:19.480]  it the United Nations Police Commanders course so what they're trying to do is
[2:34:19.480 --> 2:34:24.200]  not just nationalize the police but internationalize yes yes as it gets
[2:34:24.200 --> 2:34:28.840]  farther and farther away from us it becomes harder and harder to get control
[2:34:28.840 --> 2:34:33.160]  the situation what we see happening I think so many different aspects of
[2:34:33.160 --> 2:34:37.280]  society certainly see we see it happening with the police is that when you
[2:34:37.280 --> 2:34:42.200]  have someone who goes off of the mission statement or who is corrupt or who does
[2:34:42.200 --> 2:34:46.280]  something that you don't you don't want to have that happen there needs to be a
[2:34:46.280 --> 2:34:50.920]  method for getting control of that for rooting out the corruption for rooting
[2:34:50.920 --> 2:34:54.920]  out the bad behavior and yet we see that that's not happening we had a retired
[2:34:54.920 --> 2:34:59.520]  Marine Colonel Pete Martino come on the program he was first came to our
[2:34:59.520 --> 2:35:03.480]  attention when he spoke out about a very small town in New Hampshire being
[2:35:03.480 --> 2:35:09.120]  given a large Pentagon vehicle a bear cat in that particular case it wasn't an
[2:35:09.120 --> 2:35:13.680]  m-wrap and he was saying they don't follow the mission statement which
[2:35:13.680 --> 2:35:17.040]  ultimately as a Constitution but they each have their own individual mission
[2:35:17.040 --> 2:35:21.440]  statements and if you don't have a means to purge this corruption it just
[2:35:21.440 --> 2:35:26.040]  becomes systemic and it seems to me like if you don't have any kind of local
[2:35:26.040 --> 2:35:32.080]  control or local control of these people some way to pull that back locally as it
[2:35:32.080 --> 2:35:35.880]  gets moved farther and farther away it gets worse and worse doesn't truly and
[2:35:35.880 --> 2:35:43.160]  the thing is that the solution to it really is local involvement you know
[2:35:43.160 --> 2:35:49.320]  you can't approach a policeman and say you dirty rat it doesn't work so you try
[2:35:49.320 --> 2:35:54.760]  and become friends and and educate as many policemen as you can at the same
[2:35:54.760 --> 2:35:59.440]  time educating local officials these are police powers these are not you've
[2:35:59.440 --> 2:36:04.120]  got to follow the Constitution etc etc and so it takes an awful lot of
[2:36:04.120 --> 2:36:09.000]  education and goodwill to do that everything we see today is reactive
[2:36:09.000 --> 2:36:12.680]  they're trying to get us to react they're trying to get the people to react
[2:36:12.680 --> 2:36:16.720]  they're trying to get the police to react they put them through a lot of federal
[2:36:16.720 --> 2:36:22.080]  training for instance that imbues them with the idea that them of them and us
[2:36:22.080 --> 2:36:28.200]  yes and and these are our enemies and you can understand a little bit if the
[2:36:28.200 --> 2:36:34.320]  liberal press is there a conservative cop is against the liberal press because
[2:36:34.320 --> 2:36:38.520]  usually the press attacks the police has been the history of it they don't look
[2:36:38.520 --> 2:36:43.000]  at what really happens in a situation like this this individual that was shot
[2:36:43.000 --> 2:36:47.120]  from the front it looks like he was attacking but the liberal press is
[2:36:47.120 --> 2:36:51.680]  rushes to the idea that he was shot in the back or whatever else they may say
[2:36:51.680 --> 2:36:56.800]  so the police don't trust the media and that causes a reaction in the police and
[2:36:56.800 --> 2:37:01.120]  in the media as a result and we see that not only with the police but I see it in
[2:37:01.120 --> 2:37:05.160]  our interaction with every government official but when we come to them and
[2:37:05.160 --> 2:37:08.720]  talk to them it's like they're all acting as if they're the CIA now you know
[2:37:08.720 --> 2:37:11.800]  they've got this secret information that they don't want to share with me there
[2:37:11.800 --> 2:37:16.520]  is no more transparency in government everything is it seems like it is hidden
[2:37:16.520 --> 2:37:20.840]  they don't want to be forthright and and come out with it I think if they had
[2:37:20.840 --> 2:37:25.240]  that information they should have shared it much much earlier now when it comes
[2:37:25.240 --> 2:37:32.000]  out that all the shots are in the front that the police officer has a major
[2:37:32.000 --> 2:37:35.880]  injury to his eye where he was struck as things like that are coming out if we
[2:37:35.880 --> 2:37:39.880]  don't get that out early if they're not transparent about it when it eventually
[2:37:39.880 --> 2:37:44.480]  comes out in a trial and the and the officers found innocent if that's what
[2:37:44.480 --> 2:37:47.320]  happens the public's not going to believe it because there were so clothes
[2:37:47.320 --> 2:37:51.640]  left about it so in a way it's almost as if they are trying to ferment this
[2:37:51.640 --> 2:37:57.080]  red this disruption that's true and and if you remember this 60s and 70s we had
[2:37:57.080 --> 2:38:03.320]  a lot of so-called peace men of peace but the peace the way they implement it
[2:38:03.320 --> 2:38:08.280]  was designed to provoke mm-hmm and so you may have a peaceful demonstration but
[2:38:08.280 --> 2:38:13.920]  it may not quite be peaceful one of the things that that we see in all of this
[2:38:13.920 --> 2:38:19.120]  is a reoccurrence of what happened in the 60s and 70s as it becomes more
[2:38:19.120 --> 2:38:25.840]  reactive by on both sides you get more militarization mm-hmm and and and they
[2:38:25.840 --> 2:38:31.080]  pass more laws they always want more laws but we get back to the point to by
[2:38:31.080 --> 2:38:35.480]  the way the John Burt society in my town stopped a riot before it got going we
[2:38:35.480 --> 2:38:39.440]  knew it was planned we knew what they what they had to do they had to get
[2:38:39.440 --> 2:38:45.280]  people into the streets mm-hmm we went door-to-door in the central area of the
[2:38:45.280 --> 2:38:50.280]  town and said stay home make it a quiet weekend they didn't have a riot while
[2:38:50.280 --> 2:38:54.640]  all the rest of the country was burning down but it was no conspiracy that just
[2:38:54.640 --> 2:38:59.640]  that that all happened at the same time yeah yeah exactly but we were able to do
[2:38:59.640 --> 2:39:03.440]  that by telling the people look don't let your kids out in the street this
[2:39:03.440 --> 2:39:08.960]  weekend just keep them home and and so that's the sort of thing is if if people
[2:39:08.960 --> 2:39:13.400]  understand that you don't rally to to the noise in the streets you can't get
[2:39:13.400 --> 2:39:17.000]  them whipped up to do things that causes a reaction on the part of the police
[2:39:17.000 --> 2:39:20.040]  which caused the reaction on the part of the crowd which causes a further
[2:39:20.040 --> 2:39:25.080]  reaction and it escalates out of control mm-hmm and so we do know they're
[2:39:25.080 --> 2:39:29.200]  outside agitators coming in that's always been the problem in in our
[2:39:29.200 --> 2:39:35.680]  country in that regard we I can say this almost universally there's no riot
[2:39:35.680 --> 2:39:40.280]  that occurs that isn't organized beforehand even in the history of the
[2:39:40.280 --> 2:39:43.880]  United States I'll tell you a little factoid that that's going to be in my
[2:39:43.880 --> 2:39:50.520]  new book most people don't know that there was a riot in Philadelphia when
[2:39:50.520 --> 2:39:55.080]  it was the capital of the United States searching for Washington to drag them
[2:39:55.080 --> 2:40:01.240]  out and hang him true really foreign agents stirred it up but that sort of
[2:40:01.240 --> 2:40:05.640]  thing is always planned all these things like that these public disturbance
[2:40:05.640 --> 2:40:10.920]  are very well planned I've talked to an awful lot of ex-communists and others
[2:40:10.920 --> 2:40:14.840]  that have told me they were trained to do that kind of thing and how they were
[2:40:14.840 --> 2:40:20.120]  able to do it they could take a little spark and and blow it up out of control
[2:40:20.120 --> 2:40:25.880]  very easily particularly if there was suspicion between them and us so what
[2:40:25.880 --> 2:40:30.080]  we what we advocate is let's get friendly let's talk to each other let's get
[2:40:30.080 --> 2:40:34.360]  to know our neighbors for instance you know in some communities we don't even
[2:40:34.360 --> 2:40:38.520]  know the name of our next door neighbor well and as we've seen in Ferguson the
[2:40:38.520 --> 2:40:42.280]  people that are being arrested are increasingly from outside of the area
[2:40:42.280 --> 2:40:46.320]  the people who are the troublemakers I think what's concerning us as we saw
[2:40:46.320 --> 2:40:49.720]  from the very beginning we saw new rules of engagement where they were
[2:40:49.720 --> 2:40:53.560]  essentially on the very first day lighting up with sniper rifles people
[2:40:53.560 --> 2:40:57.040]  from a great distance you can see the red dots on your chest so we have a
[2:40:57.040 --> 2:41:01.120]  different rule set of rule of engagement here but this is something that has been
[2:41:01.120 --> 2:41:05.240]  ramping up for quite some time before we run out of time I want to go back and
[2:41:05.240 --> 2:41:08.560]  talk a little bit about the history of the John Burt society one of the people
[2:41:08.560 --> 2:41:14.600]  that I always knew the best was Larry McDonald I really admired him and Ron
[2:41:14.600 --> 2:41:19.880]  Paul said that he was the most principled man in Congress and that's quite a
[2:41:19.880 --> 2:41:24.000]  compliment coming from someone as principled as Ron Paul we got a clip
[2:41:24.000 --> 2:41:28.800]  here where he went on CNN Crossfire just shortly before the plane that he was on
[2:41:28.800 --> 2:41:33.920]  was shot down or captured or whatever they and it was Tom Braden who was
[2:41:33.920 --> 2:41:37.520]  somebody that was involved intimately with the creation of the CIA he was in
[2:41:37.520 --> 2:41:44.000]  the OSS and he also was involved with the operation Mockingbird which was if
[2:41:44.000 --> 2:41:49.480]  people are not familiar with that that was a means to get the press to be
[2:41:49.480 --> 2:41:54.160]  controlled by the CIA this guy pulled all the stops out if you listen to how
[2:41:54.160 --> 2:41:57.960]  many times he uses conspiracy is very interesting this is Pat Buchanan Tom
[2:41:57.960 --> 2:42:01.320]  Braden and Larry McDonald here's a little clip of this what you can see on
[2:42:01.320 --> 2:42:05.280]  the on YouTube this is the one group I think that those who would radically
[2:42:05.280 --> 2:42:10.000]  change America seriously fear and a tremendous campaign with Larry McDonald
[2:42:10.000 --> 2:42:16.200]  in December of 1960 right to move to discredit the John Burt society and
[2:42:16.200 --> 2:42:20.440]  frankly launch the mission orders coming out of well Mr. McDonald I'm not a
[2:42:20.440 --> 2:42:28.000]  conspirator I think even Buchanan would vouch for that Robert Robert well no I don't think
[2:42:28.000 --> 2:42:31.840]  yeah I'm a member of the Council on Foreign Affairs you've certainly let me
[2:42:31.840 --> 2:42:35.960]  just say what Newsweek says that says that the John Burt society considers
[2:42:35.960 --> 2:42:42.080]  communism only one arm of a national of a master conspiracy in which socialist
[2:42:42.080 --> 2:42:47.320]  American insiders are plotting to establish world government now he also
[2:42:47.320 --> 2:42:51.880]  says and here's director John McManus that's your public relations director
[2:42:51.880 --> 2:42:57.520]  saying it former Secretary of State Alexander Hague and CIA director William
[2:42:57.520 --> 2:43:02.640]  Casey are two of these master conspirators who are plotting to
[2:43:02.640 --> 2:43:07.240]  establish world government now what do you say you know that kind of silly
[2:43:07.240 --> 2:43:11.760]  asinine statement is what makes people make people laugh that's the John Burt
[2:43:11.760 --> 2:43:16.400]  today well Tom I'm sure being a long-standing member of the Rocker
[2:43:16.400 --> 2:43:21.360]  fellow apparatus and as a member of the Council on Foreign Relations of
[2:43:21.360 --> 2:43:25.520]  long-standing you're fully aware that you there is an elitist core in this
[2:43:25.520 --> 2:43:30.440]  country that has seen value in subsidizing communism of protecting
[2:43:30.440 --> 2:43:35.120]  communism and ash sure you're accusing me of subsidizing coming no I'm saying
[2:43:35.120 --> 2:43:39.080]  there they haven't belonged to a there isn't only color not even an
[2:43:39.080 --> 2:43:43.640]  awaited there is an elite core in this country that has dominated American
[2:43:43.640 --> 2:43:46.800]  society I'm not one of them let me try lateral commission the trial lateral
[2:43:46.800 --> 2:43:51.040]  commission also on farm relations here's a cabinet but well let's face it they've
[2:43:51.040 --> 2:43:54.760]  dominated the State Department for 40 years and pretty much openly but what
[2:43:54.760 --> 2:43:59.000]  are they trying to do well their objective is to try to bring about a
[2:43:59.000 --> 2:44:05.320]  gradual transition in our society a dissolving of sovereignty and a moving
[2:44:05.320 --> 2:44:10.520]  steadily to the left on the political spectrum where they leave the elitist
[2:44:10.520 --> 2:44:14.200]  groups that I mentioned particularly key individuals and policy makers and the
[2:44:14.200 --> 2:44:18.760]  council monetary fund part of this probably say the international monetary
[2:44:18.760 --> 2:44:24.260]  you can see that entire clip on YouTube it's about 15 minutes long and Tom
[2:44:24.260 --> 2:44:28.040]  Braden was using that technique which of course the term conspiracy theory came
[2:44:28.040 --> 2:44:32.440]  from the FBI in order to shut down anybody questioning the official story
[2:44:32.440 --> 2:44:38.000]  about the JFK assassination they use that very effectively at one point Pat Buchanan
[2:44:38.000 --> 2:44:42.800]  said that you've used that term about 45 times now use it a couple of more to
[2:44:42.800 --> 2:44:48.280]  go so that's 47 so that was basically the tactic of Tom Braden again a man who
[2:44:48.280 --> 2:44:54.200]  was intimately involved with the CIA I just loved how Larry McDonald calmly
[2:44:54.200 --> 2:44:58.040]  took all of that and explained it kept running with it and at one point he
[2:44:58.040 --> 2:45:02.560]  talked to Pat Buchanan about the council on foreign relations and Pat was
[2:45:02.560 --> 2:45:07.400]  kind of surprised that Ronald Reagan had put so many people from the CFR into
[2:45:07.400 --> 2:45:11.160]  his cabinet even though he wasn't himself a member he put something like two or
[2:45:11.160 --> 2:45:15.440]  three hundred people in the CFR in the State Department essentially controlling
[2:45:15.440 --> 2:45:19.800]  it as it had been since liberal Wilson well there's something very fundamental
[2:45:19.800 --> 2:45:26.360]  about all of this people think up ideas people organize ideas people finance
[2:45:26.360 --> 2:45:32.320]  ideas people make things happen and if you if things happen in politics that
[2:45:32.320 --> 2:45:36.800]  you know they were planned if you have this these plans and they're done
[2:45:36.800 --> 2:45:42.800]  behind closed doors or out of sight of the public like the TPP or the trend
[2:45:42.800 --> 2:45:46.000]  in the Trans-Pacific Partnership or these trade deals yeah and if it's for
[2:45:46.000 --> 2:45:51.880]  evil it's a conspiracy and so that's what we're talking about now we do believe
[2:45:51.880 --> 2:45:56.720]  that there is an organized conspiracy at the top that manipulates all of these
[2:45:56.720 --> 2:46:01.360]  things I'm putting the final touches on on a book that I've been working on for
[2:46:01.360 --> 2:46:08.880]  45 years on the first hundred years of this country 1776 to 1876 and I show
[2:46:08.880 --> 2:46:15.000]  how that conspiracy worked in that time period people don't know how much
[2:46:15.000 --> 2:46:20.680]  society and government has changed in America and that how we have to get back
[2:46:20.680 --> 2:46:26.200]  to what they gave us originally we have to unamend the Constitution rather than
[2:46:26.200 --> 2:46:31.040]  add amendments to it we've got to get rid of the 16th and the 17th amendments
[2:46:31.040 --> 2:46:35.720]  in order to have a balanced budget it won't work otherwise things of that
[2:46:35.720 --> 2:46:39.480]  nature would that's a whole hour's talk and you know that we could be here all
[2:46:39.480 --> 2:46:44.600]  day but the thing is that that it's the information that the people don't have
[2:46:44.600 --> 2:46:50.840]  that is the real killer I watch a lot of Fox News because I scream at them less
[2:46:50.840 --> 2:46:57.920]  than the other channels because it's not so much what they say as much as what
[2:46:57.920 --> 2:47:03.920]  they do not say and and one of the things that never comes up in a neoconservative
[2:47:03.920 --> 2:47:08.960]  atmosphere or on Fox and that sort of thing is the first purpose of our
[2:47:08.960 --> 2:47:14.120]  government which is to protect the independence of our of our country you
[2:47:14.120 --> 2:47:18.320]  can't have a free country you can't have a Constitution like we have or
[2:47:18.320 --> 2:47:21.760]  anything else if the country isn't independent and that's the problem with
[2:47:21.760 --> 2:47:25.200]  these things they're taking away our independence they're going to change the
[2:47:25.200 --> 2:47:29.680]  Constitution they're trying to do it other ways is at the same time they've
[2:47:29.680 --> 2:47:34.520]  got a lot of different ways that they do these things and they zig and zag but
[2:47:34.520 --> 2:47:38.360]  they always have two main purposes and they never take their eye off those
[2:47:38.360 --> 2:47:43.280]  purposes and one is a world government and the other is no religion other than
[2:47:43.280 --> 2:47:48.720]  the state and and if you look at everything through that that prism you
[2:47:48.720 --> 2:47:53.160]  will understand what they do they may disagree with one another and when
[2:47:53.160 --> 2:47:58.000]  you're playing this kind of power game it's a very dangerous game we always say
[2:47:58.000 --> 2:48:02.560]  that the problem we have with dealing with them is that we are dealing with
[2:48:02.560 --> 2:48:08.200]  criminals we have to act morally and responsibly and ethically the problem
[2:48:08.200 --> 2:48:14.400]  that they have they work with criminals well and now the gloves are coming off
[2:48:14.400 --> 2:48:19.560]  now we're seeing in these trade agreements what has slipped out and
[2:48:19.560 --> 2:48:23.760]  leaked out by wiki leaks and others we see that it is now to the point where
[2:48:23.760 --> 2:48:28.480]  it is direct attack on our individual rights as we're talking about our you
[2:48:28.480 --> 2:48:32.560]  know freedom of speech freedom of press direct attacks on the internet there's
[2:48:32.560 --> 2:48:37.440]  other aspects in it but we also see our entire system of justice being turned
[2:48:37.440 --> 2:48:42.400]  over to essentially an arbitration sequence where the corporations the
[2:48:42.400 --> 2:48:47.640]  only the multinational corporations though would have equal footing to our
[2:48:47.640 --> 2:48:51.440]  sovereign countries sure of course anybody that has a business that is
[2:48:51.440 --> 2:48:56.240]  entirely inside one particular country they would have no legal standing in
[2:48:56.240 --> 2:48:59.600]  those types of agreements it's only the multinational corporations they get
[2:48:59.600 --> 2:49:03.760]  protected in that type of environment when you read marks and angles the
[2:49:03.760 --> 2:49:07.480]  comments manifesto and other writings you'll see they very rarely talk about
[2:49:07.480 --> 2:49:12.600]  revolution per se they always talk about overturning the old social order or
[2:49:12.600 --> 2:49:17.480]  social revolution etc because the government is reflective of the society
[2:49:17.480 --> 2:49:21.960]  that put it together and so they know that if they had a communist revolution
[2:49:21.960 --> 2:49:27.080]  that society could have a counter revolution and throw the rascals out so
[2:49:27.080 --> 2:49:32.200]  they know they have to change society first and so I have a whole list in here
[2:49:32.200 --> 2:49:37.640]  of all the various things that are being done to the society of the United
[2:49:37.640 --> 2:49:42.720]  States and our citizens through treaties with the United Nations and how they
[2:49:42.720 --> 2:49:48.920]  control these things fundamental rights banking trade industry education
[2:49:48.920 --> 2:49:53.920]  women birth control all the way down to tourism oh yeah and of course the family
[2:49:53.920 --> 2:49:57.720]  as well have the UN convention on the rights of the child absolutely they
[2:49:57.720 --> 2:50:02.160]  to essentially directly replace the family with the state that's correct
[2:50:02.160 --> 2:50:07.440]  yes yeah and it's and everything will be the state it's it's really interesting
[2:50:07.440 --> 2:50:11.200]  that way one of the things that that just to give you an idea of one of the
[2:50:11.200 --> 2:50:15.920]  problems with free trade that everybody can understand is what is the most what
[2:50:15.920 --> 2:50:22.000]  it what does every country in the world use as a monetary unit it's called paper
[2:50:22.000 --> 2:50:28.000]  that's what they all use so if you have an agreement between one or more
[2:50:28.000 --> 2:50:33.640]  countries they have a printing press for their paper and if any of those get out
[2:50:33.640 --> 2:50:38.080]  of balance with speeding the press up it throws the whole trade agreement out
[2:50:38.080 --> 2:50:42.440]  the window because the rate of exchange goes belly up and so that's why they
[2:50:42.440 --> 2:50:47.720]  need a centralized currency to take it over which is really dangerous then you
[2:50:47.720 --> 2:50:52.040]  have no control over your economy at all we're gonna be right back with Arthur

[2:54:17.840 --> 2:54:22.920]  Thompson CEO of the John Burt society he is on a show on a book tour with your
[2:54:22.920 --> 2:54:27.520]  new book international merger by foreign entanglements and you have a meeting
[2:54:27.520 --> 2:54:31.440]  coming up tomorrow in Houston tell us about that where people can find you
[2:54:31.440 --> 2:54:35.440]  at that meeting where at the Christie restaurant not sure what the address is

[2:54:41.480 --> 2:54:48.960]  addressing in at length what's in my book international merger and talking
[2:54:48.960 --> 2:54:52.320]  about what they can also do about it yeah let's talk about that I wouldn't
[2:54:52.320 --> 2:54:57.120]  talk about that in this segment what do we do as we see things accelerating we
[2:54:57.120 --> 2:55:02.680]  see what we've been talking about for 20 years you know now like what Alice has
[2:55:02.680 --> 2:55:07.840]  been talking about what you guys have been talking about for decades we see
[2:55:07.840 --> 2:55:12.320]  this now being exposed it's no longer being done in secret it's being done
[2:55:12.320 --> 2:55:16.560]  openly and so now the question is what do we do about this now that it is
[2:55:16.560 --> 2:55:21.520]  getting so close to fruition well for one thing people have to understand they
[2:55:21.520 --> 2:55:25.640]  have to be involved if you think that you're going to stop this without being
[2:55:25.640 --> 2:55:31.440]  involved you're very mistaken but one of the things that we say is that we need
[2:55:31.440 --> 2:55:35.920]  to educate the opinion molders in our community we have to get close to the
[2:55:35.920 --> 2:55:41.080]  Boy Scout leader the Kiwanian the city councilman our state representative
[2:55:41.080 --> 2:55:46.640]  etc and give them things to read give them DVDs on the Constitution and that
[2:55:46.640 --> 2:55:51.000]  sort of thing until they get to trust you and they start actually coming to you
[2:55:51.000 --> 2:55:58.960]  for information as you get the opinion molders informed things start to happen
[2:55:58.960 --> 2:56:04.040]  the community starts to change now everybody agrees that a third of the
[2:56:04.040 --> 2:56:08.680]  people during the war for independence were for independence a third were
[2:56:08.680 --> 2:56:14.560]  against and a third could care less but the key was that the people for
[2:56:14.560 --> 2:56:21.280]  independence were able to get to 60% of that 5% who run the community in other
[2:56:21.280 --> 2:56:28.720]  words six you know it was only 3% if we can get to that 3% today we will win but
[2:56:28.720 --> 2:56:32.360]  we don't because we don't get involved enough and we need to do it in a
[2:56:32.360 --> 2:56:37.120]  concerted manner so that we're all doing the same thing at the same time on the
[2:56:37.120 --> 2:56:43.440]  same subject same solution etc and don't diffuse our forces this is what we do
[2:56:43.440 --> 2:56:46.920]  in the John Burt society we organize local chapters to get out there and
[2:56:46.920 --> 2:56:53.280]  educate people you know so give them books give them pamphlets get them to
[2:56:53.280 --> 2:56:59.080]  subscribe to the magazine come to speeches watch DVDs watch your program
[2:56:59.080 --> 2:57:03.440]  that kind of thing and you do it in an organized way an organized way yes and
[2:57:03.440 --> 2:57:09.000]  so that's what really will will save the day in the long run and we've got
[2:57:09.000 --> 2:57:14.000]  places around the country where we've we've done this very well and it's
[2:57:14.000 --> 2:57:19.800]  changed that state and that community we're concentrating now in in certain
[2:57:19.800 --> 2:57:23.920]  states I won't mention which they are because we seem to have people to kind
[2:57:23.920 --> 2:57:27.680]  of get in there and try to muddy the waters when we when we broadcast these
[2:57:27.680 --> 2:57:33.800]  things but we are organizing in areas to make a real difference in Congress but
[2:57:33.800 --> 2:57:37.720]  again most people don't want to get involved they don't want to give up
[2:57:37.720 --> 2:57:43.000]  their time their energy or their money for whatever reason and so you get just
[2:57:43.000 --> 2:57:47.240]  a few and that's all it really takes we know that we have 500 members in a
[2:57:47.240 --> 2:57:52.080]  congressional district it's over from dog catcher to Congress they'll elect the
[2:57:52.080 --> 2:57:55.960]  most conservative constitutionalist on the ballot that's the way it works it
[2:57:55.960 --> 2:57:59.720]  takes a little time to season I mean you don't have 500 members and say we've
[2:57:59.720 --> 2:58:04.960]  won because then those 500 members have to work in educating the community but
[2:58:04.960 --> 2:58:09.320]  once they do that that's the sort of thing that happens every time so when
[2:58:09.320 --> 2:58:12.720]  you go into the community you're are you focusing primarily or about out of time
[2:58:12.720 --> 2:58:18.200]  well I wish we had more time to talk to you if anybody wants to get more into
[2:58:18.200 --> 2:58:23.160]  this of course mr. Thompson will be at the Christie's Steakhouse tomorrow at
[2:58:23.160 --> 2:58:29.000]  noon in Houston Texas JBS.org is there JBS.org and the new American.com
