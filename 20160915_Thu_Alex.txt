[00:00.000 --> 00:15.440]  It's already Thursday, 15th day of September 2016, it's kickoff, another attack on the
[00:15.440 --> 00:16.440]  globe.
[00:16.440 --> 00:24.080]  From the Infowars.com News Center, deep behind enemy lines in occupied Texas and broadcasting
[00:24.080 --> 00:30.200]  worldwide, you're listening to the voice of human resistance against the technotronic
[00:30.200 --> 00:33.600]  technocracy tank goper.
[00:33.600 --> 00:43.120]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:43.120 --> 00:51.800]  You know I'm really glad to see Breitbart consistently scooping Infowars.com.
[00:51.800 --> 00:54.960]  And by the way, that's not satire.
[00:54.960 --> 01:00.600]  I have a lot of great reporters, investigative journalists, but we don't have enough.
[01:00.600 --> 01:11.640]  And so for days, we've had the Colin Powell emails from the Packers, obviously.
[01:11.640 --> 01:16.640]  And just pouring through them, I was personally looking at the Bohemian Grove emails yesterday.
[01:16.640 --> 01:21.280]  And I said, give it to Watson, but he's overwhelmed, he's been working seven days a week, eighteen
[01:21.280 --> 01:22.280]  hours a day.
[01:22.280 --> 01:26.360]  And I said, one of you guys can write on it, and then boom, I woke up this morning and
[01:26.360 --> 01:30.160]  there it was, Breitbart.
[01:30.160 --> 01:33.640]  Bohemian Grove wants to stop Donald Trump.
[01:33.640 --> 01:39.280]  The establishment Republicans, just one more delicious cherry telling me how good Donald
[01:39.280 --> 01:42.320]  Trump is on top of things.
[01:42.320 --> 01:48.000]  If that group of a feat, and I'm not saying everyone that goes there's bad, obviously
[01:48.000 --> 01:55.360]  I've been forecast, I mean, folks like Clint Eastwood, you know, it goes, it's beautiful,
[01:55.360 --> 01:56.360]  it's nice.
[01:56.360 --> 01:59.760]  You can use it, you're around if you're a member.
[01:59.760 --> 02:05.720]  It's the stuff that goes on in July, that's weird.
[02:05.720 --> 02:10.360]  But if you just sit there and look at Bohemian Grove alone, and they're totally freaking out
[02:10.360 --> 02:14.480]  over Donald Trump saying they're going to vote for Hillary Clinton, and they quote, Trump
[02:14.480 --> 02:18.160]  will be a disaster, well that's because they're special interests that have hijacked this
[02:18.160 --> 02:19.160]  country.
[02:19.160 --> 02:24.920]  What do you call it, Trilateral Commission, CFR, Bilderberg Group, Bohemian Grove, it's
[02:24.920 --> 02:29.960]  all the same players that run those groups, that are basically running our country and
[02:29.960 --> 02:35.080]  running Europe into the ground, and starting all these wars, and playing both sides and
[02:35.080 --> 02:45.480]  being totally amoral, and then they've got a huge hard on for Americana, and because
[02:45.480 --> 02:54.120]  it threatens them, even though they've hijacked it and become basically kings of the world,
[02:54.120 --> 02:58.200]  they stole it so they want to destroy it even though it gives them their power, and that's
[02:58.200 --> 03:01.600]  the globalist fundamental sin.
[03:01.600 --> 03:08.160]  The head of the IMF came out yesterday, legronde or whatever that stupid lady's name is, and
[03:08.160 --> 03:10.960]  I'll have to look at it for years, it said the French have to work seven days a week
[03:10.960 --> 03:17.560]  and all the rest is garbage, and the people should pay more taxes, she came out and said
[03:17.560 --> 03:24.120]  globalism needs to distribute more wealth, or its promise will be lost.
[03:24.120 --> 03:30.960]  Globalism was set up to screw everyone over, it's a eugenics-based planetary program.
[03:30.960 --> 03:34.320]  Yes, college students and people that get inducted into it, get told we're going to
[03:34.320 --> 03:40.840]  save the world, it's going to be like Starfleet with the Captain Kirk flying around saving
[03:40.840 --> 03:42.320]  everybody.
[03:42.320 --> 03:49.680]  Legronde's slams globalization warns of a ground swell of discontent when they're the
[03:49.680 --> 03:55.840]  ones that are engineering with discontent, and we even have their stinking emails with
[03:55.840 --> 03:59.680]  George Soros and her planning all this stuff.
[03:59.680 --> 04:04.880]  It's incredible, you people are scum and you think you're better than everybody and you
[04:04.880 --> 04:11.840]  want to destroy prosperity because you don't want to compete with anybody, go to hell.
[04:11.840 --> 04:17.200]  People are through, they're dying, so I've got masses of news and Tim Kennedy's coming
[04:17.200 --> 04:22.480]  on today, this kind of dropped my lap last week, you know friends with Tim and Shane,
[04:22.480 --> 04:26.200]  and Tim for a couple years started using supermail vitality off and on, then he went and got checked
[04:26.200 --> 04:30.200]  to make sure he was allowed to with the anti-doping agency, and they came and tested him four
[04:30.200 --> 04:35.120]  times in one day, and they said no, no, these herbs, you're allowed to take them, he says
[04:35.120 --> 04:38.640]  it's really helped him, but that's not why he's coming on to plug supermail vitality
[04:38.640 --> 04:44.320]  today, but this all kind of happened by accident, he's coming on to tell you about the next
[04:44.320 --> 04:49.560]  big fight, which is still not been confirmed anywhere, it'll be confirmed here coming
[04:49.560 --> 04:54.040]  up when Tim Kennedy is in studio with us, sometime in the third hour because he's literally
[04:54.040 --> 04:57.200]  only working out twice today at fight camp down the street, he's going to come over
[04:57.200 --> 05:02.040]  here, so stay with us.
[05:02.040 --> 05:06.200]  Could this be the last month we have uncensored free internet here in the United States?
[05:06.200 --> 05:10.640]  The President has decided the U.S. will no longer oversee an open uncensored internet
[05:10.640 --> 05:15.320]  here, and unless Congress steps in, he will begin transition of stewardship to the United
[05:15.320 --> 05:16.320]  Nations.
[05:16.320 --> 05:20.200]  Now this new power grab will be given to authoritarian governments who have a vested
[05:20.200 --> 05:23.600]  interest in censoring undesirable content on the web.
[05:23.600 --> 05:28.160]  The U.S. Congress and its leaders led by Senator Ted Cruz are engaged in an all out
[05:28.160 --> 05:30.800]  war on Capitol Hill to keep the internet free.
[05:30.800 --> 05:35.560]  Now if they're unsuccessful Obama will hand over their power on September 30th, and that's
[05:35.560 --> 05:39.480]  a move even former President Bill Clinton warned quote, a lot of people who've been
[05:39.480 --> 05:43.760]  trying to take this authority away from the U.S. want to do it for the sole purpose of
[05:43.760 --> 05:48.880]  cracking down on internet freedom and limiting it and having governments protect their backsides
[05:48.880 --> 05:50.880]  instead of empower their people.
[05:50.880 --> 05:55.120]  And our own President is in lockstep with this power grab, an undeniable blow to free
[05:55.120 --> 05:56.120]  speech.
[05:56.120 --> 06:26.080]  I'm Margaret Hall reporting for Infowars.com.
[06:26.080 --> 06:50.220]  Thank you for being with us tonight on Infowars.com, thank you to members of our community for
[06:50.220 --> 06:51.740]  our InfowarsHealth.com.
[06:51.740 --> 06:53.500]  So many people call into my radio show
[06:53.500 --> 06:55.620]  and tell me how young Jebedee and the products

[06:58.060 --> 06:59.700]  Check it out for yourself today.
[07:00.980 --> 07:04.260]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.

[07:06.540 --> 07:08.420]  a scientifically formulated blend

[07:26.300 --> 07:28.300]  Deep Cleanse doesn't hold back.

[08:00.180 --> 08:30.020]  When I grow up, I ought to be a rock star.
[08:30.020 --> 08:34.220]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center
[08:34.220 --> 08:36.420]  in the heart of the Resistance.
[08:36.420 --> 08:38.820]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[08:38.820 --> 08:42.500]  I just rolled for 40 days.
[08:42.500 --> 08:46.580]  Last night, little rock put me in a haze.
[08:46.580 --> 08:50.020]  Sweet, sweet, honey was doing her acts.
[08:50.020 --> 08:51.500]  She had the whole show at the time.
[08:51.500 --> 08:53.620]  We have got a very full plate today, obviously,
[08:53.620 --> 08:54.740]  and we are now...
[08:54.740 --> 08:56.340]  LeBone Night!
[08:56.340 --> 08:58.700]  How many days is it until the great election?
[08:58.700 --> 09:04.180]  53 days, of edge-of-your-seat craziness.
[09:04.180 --> 09:06.020]  Keep me right.
[09:06.020 --> 09:09.220]  As long as we can make it to the show tonight.
[09:09.220 --> 09:13.620]  We have Tim Kennedy, the Army Sniper, Green Beret,
[09:13.620 --> 09:16.620]  Patriot, a friend of the show,
[09:16.620 --> 09:24.460]  coming on to announce the new big national fight
[09:24.460 --> 09:29.580]  that's been so heavily anticipated for several years.
[09:29.580 --> 09:31.020]  And so he wants to announce it here.
[09:31.020 --> 09:32.180]  We're honored to have him announce it here.
[09:32.180 --> 09:34.140]  He's also one of the hosts and one of the investigators
[09:34.140 --> 09:35.980]  on Hunting Hitler.
[09:35.980 --> 09:37.460]  Long bio, obviously, for Tim Kennedy.
[09:37.460 --> 09:39.380]  He's going to be popping in.
[09:39.380 --> 09:41.140]  And then we have Anthony Cummium,
[09:41.140 --> 09:45.380]  who of course hosts his own program.
[09:45.380 --> 09:49.180]  And it was basically kicked off XM and his former show
[09:49.180 --> 09:51.260]  for being a Trump supporter.
[09:51.260 --> 09:56.780]  He's going to be hosting the fourth hour today from...
[09:56.780 --> 09:58.100]  Is it from New York or Florida?
[09:58.100 --> 10:00.020]  I know he lives both places.
[10:00.020 --> 10:03.620]  So that's coming up today.
[10:03.620 --> 10:08.740]  When I particularly have big stacks of news,
[10:08.740 --> 10:11.620]  it tends to almost make me calm down.
[10:11.620 --> 10:16.100]  It's like I'm sitting down for Thanksgiving supper or something.
[10:16.100 --> 10:18.220]  There's just so much to cover.
[10:18.220 --> 10:22.700]  It's almost daunting.
[10:22.700 --> 10:25.340]  We're going to do our best here to cover it all.
[10:25.340 --> 10:30.260]  Here's the first thing I want to say today, just in retrospect.
[10:30.260 --> 10:34.580]  We are seeing the fall of the establishment right now.
[10:34.580 --> 10:40.020]  We are seeing their arrogance, their hubris, cave in on them.
[10:40.020 --> 10:42.500]  And even if they pull false flags and are
[10:42.500 --> 10:45.660]  able to steal the election, they will basically only
[10:45.660 --> 10:47.580]  make it that much worse for themselves.
[10:47.580 --> 10:49.980]  The problem is studying them, watching them,
[10:49.980 --> 10:51.900]  looking at the psychology, the criminology,
[10:51.900 --> 10:53.420]  and talking to a lot of other experts.
[10:53.420 --> 10:55.060]  They concur with my view.
[10:55.060 --> 10:57.700]  Or I could say we share the view and the belief
[10:57.700 --> 10:59.140]  and the understanding, unfortunately,
[10:59.140 --> 11:01.100]  that they're not going to turn loose of power
[11:01.100 --> 11:05.860]  without almost any level of crisis you can imagine.
[11:05.860 --> 11:10.100]  And so it really is up to the military and this quote,
[11:10.100 --> 11:13.700]  security services and others to decide
[11:13.700 --> 11:18.420]  whether you want to lose the prosperity and have America
[11:18.420 --> 11:21.060]  completely collapse so that George Soros and a few other
[11:21.060 --> 11:23.340]  weirdo globalists who think that their messiahs can
[11:23.340 --> 11:25.700]  piss on you and your family.
[11:25.700 --> 11:28.380]  Because I'm not even going to talk to you like you're moral.
[11:28.380 --> 11:31.420]  I know some are, some aren't.
[11:31.420 --> 11:34.900]  But this is end of the line for America.
[11:34.900 --> 11:37.540]  And that's why you're seeing all these amazing things happen.
[11:37.540 --> 11:39.180]  That's why you're seeing all these documents come out
[11:39.180 --> 11:41.660]  exposing the Clintons and the Democrats and the globalists
[11:41.660 --> 11:45.020]  and the Republican Party because anybody
[11:45.020 --> 11:47.420]  on this planet that bleeds red blood
[11:47.420 --> 11:51.340]  and cares about their children knows that true evil
[11:51.340 --> 11:56.580]  is nesting and growing and incubating in Washington DC,
[11:56.580 --> 11:59.380]  in New York, in places like Los Angeles
[11:59.380 --> 12:02.700]  with these totally disconnected globalists
[12:02.700 --> 12:05.300]  who hijacked America, took over the planet
[12:05.300 --> 12:10.020]  with America's ingenuity and brawn and courage
[12:10.020 --> 12:15.020]  and guts and are so threatened by the spirit of America,
[12:16.460 --> 12:20.580]  though, that they want to finally basically bring
[12:20.580 --> 12:22.020]  the Republic to heel.
[12:25.660 --> 12:27.740]  These are very, very destructive,
[12:27.740 --> 12:30.580]  very, very degenerate people.
[12:30.580 --> 12:31.860]  They don't like honor.
[12:31.860 --> 12:32.980]  They don't like wealth.
[12:32.980 --> 12:34.660]  They don't like real power.
[12:34.660 --> 12:36.460]  They don't like real confidence.
[12:36.460 --> 12:39.780]  They run from it like vampires run from
[12:39.780 --> 12:44.780]  the crack of dawn and America is finding its spirit again
[12:45.260 --> 12:47.540]  and other countries are finding its spirit as well
[12:47.540 --> 12:52.540]  because we're identifying the global corporate combines
[12:52.940 --> 12:55.820]  that are establishing this planetary government.
[12:56.740 --> 12:59.500]  And once those are identified and once you know
[12:59.500 --> 13:01.580]  that the French socialists, almost all of them
[13:01.580 --> 13:03.180]  have been caught with Swiss bank accounts
[13:03.180 --> 13:08.180]  as they raise the middle class taxes to 101%.
[13:08.180 --> 13:09.820]  And you go, well, that's crazy.
[13:09.820 --> 13:10.660]  That'll destroy everybody.
[13:10.660 --> 13:12.300]  That's the plan.
[13:12.300 --> 13:13.460]  They are robbing you.
[13:13.460 --> 13:15.220]  They're leaving you with nothing.
[13:16.620 --> 13:19.460]  They are absolutely full of criminal energy.
[13:21.180 --> 13:23.100]  And if you wanna know what the country's gonna look like,
[13:23.100 --> 13:26.980]  it's France, totally invaded with groups
[13:26.980 --> 13:29.180]  that hate Western culture
[13:30.300 --> 13:33.100]  because the globalist hate Western culture
[13:33.100 --> 13:38.380]  because it's antithetical to what they're going to build.
[13:40.380 --> 13:44.540]  We now have more Guccifer 2.0 documents coming out.
[13:44.540 --> 13:49.540]  Obama sold off public offices to donors.
[13:50.540 --> 13:52.420]  You know, it's funny how the globalists
[13:52.420 --> 13:57.420]  built this giant NSA, panopticonic surveillance grid,
[13:57.780 --> 13:59.860]  and then they thought they would control it.
[13:59.860 --> 14:03.380]  They didn't know that people that are at the telecoms,
[14:03.380 --> 14:06.740]  you name it, know how to just jack right into it themselves
[14:06.740 --> 14:08.260]  and take anything they want.
[14:08.260 --> 14:12.300]  You people built glass houses for everybody
[14:12.300 --> 14:14.340]  and then you're the ones committing the crimes,
[14:14.340 --> 14:16.460]  not a very smart move, Dumbo.
[14:20.340 --> 14:21.700]  What do you think the agencies find out
[14:21.700 --> 14:22.980]  when they snoop around Alex Jones?
[14:22.980 --> 14:25.420]  Somebody dedicated 18 hours a day fighting hard,
[14:25.420 --> 14:27.860]  taking on tyrants, being infiltrated,
[14:27.860 --> 14:30.980]  being attacked mercilessly and never stopping.
[14:30.980 --> 14:33.500]  That's honorable, we get admired.
[14:33.500 --> 14:34.700]  People break into your emails,
[14:34.700 --> 14:37.580]  they find a bunch of scum shelling us out,
[14:37.580 --> 14:40.860]  who hate their own children, who are basically devil worshipers.
[14:41.860 --> 14:44.100]  People don't want to be ruled and run by you.
[14:45.100 --> 14:46.500]  And of course, you know that.
[14:46.500 --> 14:49.420]  You are spiritually very, very twisted,
[14:51.420 --> 14:52.620]  witch-like creatures.
[14:54.660 --> 14:56.580]  So as I plunge into the news here,
[14:56.580 --> 14:59.980]  all of you that have signed up with the New World Order,
[14:59.980 --> 15:01.540]  all of you that are going along
[15:01.540 --> 15:04.100]  with this globalist system are insane.
[15:06.700 --> 15:08.020]  Because you're fooling yourselves,
[15:08.020 --> 15:10.420]  you're lying to yourselves that you're a winner
[15:10.420 --> 15:12.180]  because you signed up with the devil.
[15:14.100 --> 15:16.900]  Lemon on CNN, who is one of the most sycophantic,
[15:16.900 --> 15:18.460]  pro-clinic people I've ever seen,
[15:18.460 --> 15:20.660]  even laughed when Hillary came out and said,
[15:20.660 --> 15:22.540]  I've been the most religious person in the world
[15:22.540 --> 15:25.460]  and I've been the most religious person in the world.
[15:25.460 --> 15:28.060]  He said, I've been the most transparent candidate
[15:28.060 --> 15:30.460]  in presidential election history.
[15:32.340 --> 15:35.260]  Just like the outgoing State Department spokesman
[15:35.260 --> 15:38.260]  started laughing and freaking out and having a breakdown
[15:38.260 --> 15:41.460]  and said, can you tell it's my last day at work?
[15:41.460 --> 15:43.180]  And the guy's laughing like it's funny,
[15:43.180 --> 15:46.180]  but you can tell he's actually totally freaked out
[15:46.180 --> 15:49.300]  and realizes that he has betrayed his name,
[15:49.300 --> 15:52.220]  his family, his children and everybody
[15:52.220 --> 15:56.820]  that has signed on to a bunch of wicked, horrible, evil people.
[15:56.820 --> 16:00.380]  I mean, Hillary Clinton, folks, they don't have animals,
[16:00.380 --> 16:03.700]  they don't give people tips, they don't have gardens,
[16:04.860 --> 16:06.020]  they don't go out to the beach.
[16:06.020 --> 16:08.260]  Remember how weird Bill Clinton would look at the beach
[16:08.260 --> 16:10.740]  like a zombie even before he got sick?
[16:10.740 --> 16:13.620]  Because these aren't demons, ladies and gentlemen.
[16:14.500 --> 16:15.780]  These aren't normal people.
[16:15.780 --> 16:20.780]  And they don't let the secret service look them in the face.
[16:23.060 --> 16:25.700]  If you're a maid in the White House and you look at Hillary,
[16:25.700 --> 16:27.300]  you're fired the next day.
[16:27.300 --> 16:32.300]  These are entitled, bloated, weak, rotting, sick, filth.
[16:36.180 --> 16:39.700]  And Hillary calls me dark-hearted, because the truth is,
[16:39.700 --> 16:41.500]  my heart's the opposite of that.
[16:41.500 --> 16:44.620]  And she knows, I see her, very, very clearly.
[16:45.620 --> 16:47.500]  But it's not the Russians that are hacking
[16:47.500 --> 16:48.780]  the majority of the emails.
[16:48.780 --> 16:50.380]  The Russians tell you when they've done it,
[16:50.380 --> 16:53.300]  like the UN emails where they were hiding the decline
[16:53.300 --> 16:55.580]  in temperature and setting up global carbon taxes.
[16:55.580 --> 16:57.620]  Thank God Russia did that.
[16:57.620 --> 16:59.500]  But I can tell you, ladies and gentlemen,
[16:59.500 --> 17:01.900]  it's people inside the DNC and it's people
[17:01.900 --> 17:04.500]  inside federal agencies, just like Snowden.
[17:04.500 --> 17:06.700]  That's where almost all this is coming from.
[17:06.700 --> 17:08.500]  It's coming from the United States.
[17:08.500 --> 17:11.700]  That's where almost all this is coming from.
[17:11.700 --> 17:15.500]  It's coming directly from the government agencies
[17:15.500 --> 17:18.580]  that the New World Order set up to totally game the economy
[17:18.580 --> 17:19.780]  and take over society.
[17:19.780 --> 17:22.140]  Just make no mistake, the NSA is not first and foremost
[17:22.140 --> 17:24.500]  about spying on people and their basic
[17:24.500 --> 17:25.940]  little political activities.
[17:25.940 --> 17:29.260]  It's about spying on whole movements, understanding,
[17:29.260 --> 17:31.660]  trends, so you can get ahead of them.
[17:31.660 --> 17:33.380]  Future predictive programming.
[17:35.580 --> 17:36.540]  And you know what's happened?
[17:36.540 --> 17:40.300]  They've run the permutations with these systems
[17:40.300 --> 17:43.700]  and found that the current course that the Obamas
[17:43.700 --> 17:47.540]  and the Clintons and the Bushes and that group has us on
[17:47.540 --> 17:50.220]  basically ends in World War III.
[17:52.620 --> 17:55.500]  And so everyone that isn't on a suicide mission
[17:55.500 --> 17:57.740]  like Hillary Clinton to destroy the planet
[17:57.740 --> 17:59.380]  sits there and goes, well, yeah, okay,
[17:59.380 --> 18:01.660]  we can basically predict the future now.
[18:01.660 --> 18:03.940]  We have the systems, we have the technology
[18:03.940 --> 18:06.740]  and it tells us that we are really evil
[18:06.740 --> 18:08.780]  and we are the bad guys.
[18:08.780 --> 18:11.300]  Wow, the NSA discovered that America is run
[18:11.300 --> 18:13.740]  by the New World Order and that we're the bad guys.
[18:15.900 --> 18:20.140]  But we can be resurrected like the Phoenix, like Christ.
[18:20.140 --> 18:23.500]  We can be reborn politically and as a nation
[18:23.500 --> 18:26.260]  the minute we admit that and repent of it
[18:26.260 --> 18:28.700]  and start locking these globalist up.
[18:28.700 --> 18:31.780]  And I mean, go in there and grab George Soros
[18:31.780 --> 18:35.060]  and haul his ass in front of a jury.
[18:36.660 --> 18:39.180]  And after you put this guy's life on,
[18:39.180 --> 18:42.060]  you know, and it's not some personal thing to sit here
[18:42.060 --> 18:43.860]  and say, we need to lock up George Soros.
[18:43.860 --> 18:45.620]  It needs to be said.
[18:45.620 --> 18:47.020]  I don't particularly want to take on this guy.
[18:47.020 --> 18:48.620]  He's a mass murdering criminal
[18:48.620 --> 18:50.780]  that's destabilized more than 40 countries
[18:50.780 --> 18:51.620]  and brags about it.
[18:51.620 --> 18:53.780]  He is a demon incarnate.
[18:54.660 --> 18:57.780]  But I must take the field politically against him
[18:57.780 --> 19:02.780]  and just say that political means must lead to justice.
[19:04.900 --> 19:09.900]  And it's time for these people to be brought down.
[19:12.620 --> 19:14.340]  I was watching the news this morning.
[19:14.340 --> 19:17.420]  Fox News is as bad as CNN now saying that
[19:17.420 --> 19:19.060]  Homeland Security is very concerned.
[19:19.060 --> 19:21.820]  They're sure the Russians are breaking into the computers
[19:21.820 --> 19:24.060]  and the Russians are gonna steal it for Trump.
[19:24.060 --> 19:26.220]  Of course, because even in fake polls,
[19:26.220 --> 19:29.740]  Trump is six points ahead in USA Today polls
[19:29.740 --> 19:32.180]  and LA Times polls and CNN polls.
[19:32.180 --> 19:34.140]  He's six points ahead.
[19:35.180 --> 19:38.020]  I told you folks, he was 10, 15 points ahead
[19:38.020 --> 19:39.580]  in real polls months ago.
[19:40.460 --> 19:43.220]  He had a landslide of support after the RNC.
[19:43.220 --> 19:47.220]  It was a total royal flush victory.
[19:49.860 --> 19:52.540]  So they came out and put out fake polls with fake samples.
[19:52.540 --> 19:54.620]  So people started thinking, wow, Trump's really losing.
[19:54.620 --> 19:56.100]  So he wouldn't gain momentum.
[19:56.100 --> 19:59.100]  It's all a mind game, but that mind game fell in.
[20:01.100 --> 20:02.660]  There is an affordable alternative
[20:02.660 --> 20:05.020]  to the high costs of healthcare that offers freedom
[20:05.020 --> 20:07.060]  from insurance while providing compliance
[20:07.060 --> 20:09.140]  with the Obamacare individual mandate.
[20:09.140 --> 20:12.140]  Imagine having access to quality, affordable healthcare
[20:12.140 --> 20:14.420]  that allows you the freedom to choose your doctor
[20:14.420 --> 20:15.420]  and hospital.
[20:15.420 --> 20:19.100]  Members can share up to 100% of necessary medical expenses,
[20:19.100 --> 20:21.060]  including some alternative treatments.
[20:21.060 --> 20:24.380]  Find out how you and your family can contain healthcare costs
[20:24.380 --> 20:25.980]  without giving up your freedom.
[20:25.980 --> 20:30.980]  Go to libertyoncall.org, that's libertyoncall.org.
[20:55.980 --> 21:01.940]  This is Dan Pilla.
[21:01.940 --> 21:03.700]  Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?
[21:03.700 --> 21:05.340]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[21:05.340 --> 21:08.180]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[21:08.180 --> 21:10.420]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[21:10.420 --> 21:12.860]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you,
[21:12.860 --> 21:14.980]  there's no such thing as a hopeless case.

[21:30.340 --> 21:33.180]  You know about RVs, you've heard about bunkers,
[21:33.180 --> 21:35.900]  but surviving is not recreation
[21:35.900 --> 21:38.620]  and man wasn't made to live underground.

[21:59.940 --> 22:01.020]  Think about this.
[22:01.020 --> 22:03.420]  Your community's aging water infrastructure systems
[22:03.420 --> 22:05.220]  are very likely to be contaminated
[22:05.220 --> 22:06.940]  with heavy metals like lead,
[22:06.940 --> 22:09.380]  disinfection chemicals like ammonia, chlorine
[22:09.380 --> 22:11.980]  and chloramines, and pharmaceuticals like statins,
[22:11.980 --> 22:13.580]  pain meds and antidepressants.
[22:13.580 --> 22:15.740]  And no, water treatment plants are not equipped
[22:15.740 --> 22:17.860]  to filter these pharmaceutical toxins out.

[23:32.700 --> 23:34.620]  center cut, presidential bacon.
[23:34.620 --> 23:36.180]  Savory and delicious.

[23:57.340 --> 23:59.300]  Fullycookedbacon.com.
[23:59.300 --> 24:20.580]  All right, here's what I want to do.
[24:20.580 --> 24:21.820]  I'm going to open the phones up today
[24:21.820 --> 24:23.700]  throughout the entire broadcast
[24:23.700 --> 24:25.940]  for first time callers or folks who haven't called in a year
[24:25.940 --> 24:29.020]  or so and really try to actually go to your phone calls.
[24:29.020 --> 24:30.420]  But it's going to be on topic.
[24:30.420 --> 24:34.260]  Hillary's collapse, the collapse of the system,
[24:34.260 --> 24:37.140]  the collapse of confidence in the globalist system.
[24:39.020 --> 24:40.420]  Will they stage a false flag?
[24:40.420 --> 24:41.820]  This is a huge topic area.
[24:43.300 --> 24:44.740]  How are they going to try to spin this?
[24:44.740 --> 24:47.460]  I mean, you can see their spin machine is in full gear,
[24:47.460 --> 24:49.340]  but people are conscious now more and more,
[24:49.340 --> 24:50.740]  they see through it.
[24:50.740 --> 24:52.580]  Like mainstream news for the first two days
[24:52.580 --> 24:55.260]  would only show her when she first wobbles a little bit
[24:55.260 --> 24:58.740]  and says, oh, she just stumbled, what's the big deal?
[24:58.740 --> 25:03.100]  Deceiving their viewers on CNN, MSNBC, ABC, you name it,
[25:03.100 --> 25:04.780]  not showing her totally fall over
[25:04.780 --> 25:07.420]  and be drugging the vehicle, clearly having a seizure.
[25:07.420 --> 25:09.500]  She's having a seizure.
[25:09.500 --> 25:11.740]  Doctors that see the video say it's a seizure.
[25:11.740 --> 25:13.420]  We've all been in the grocery store
[25:13.420 --> 25:15.420]  or at the Hike and Bike Trail or at church
[25:15.420 --> 25:17.420]  and somebody falls out and has a seizure.
[25:18.540 --> 25:20.580]  We've all been in school.
[25:20.580 --> 25:25.580]  I remember in first grade, this cute girl
[25:25.580 --> 25:26.660]  that was always at the front row,
[25:26.660 --> 25:29.060]  it was named Sarah, I think, got up,
[25:29.060 --> 25:31.220]  walked over to the pencil sharpener,
[25:31.220 --> 25:33.100]  started having a seizure, her head went in circles
[25:33.100 --> 25:34.100]  and she fell over.
[25:35.860 --> 25:37.700]  And the teacher knew that that was in her medical record
[25:37.700 --> 25:39.020]  that she had epilepsy.
[25:39.020 --> 25:41.660]  I mean, okay, we've all had to deal with this.
[25:41.660 --> 25:42.980]  It could happen to any of us.
[25:42.980 --> 25:46.060]  The point is they're lying about it constantly
[25:46.060 --> 25:48.500]  and it's getting worse.
[25:48.500 --> 25:50.260]  The Secret Service doesn't know what's causing it.
[25:50.260 --> 25:51.940]  They told us a month to go.
[25:51.940 --> 25:55.940]  They don't know because it's also secretive.
[25:55.940 --> 25:58.020]  And it's getting worse
[25:58.020 --> 25:59.580]  and they're going to have to make an announcement.
[25:59.580 --> 26:01.460]  And now you see those preparations
[26:01.460 --> 26:03.060]  and the Democrats are just hoping
[26:03.060 --> 26:04.060]  they can push this through.
[26:04.060 --> 26:07.100]  But Hillary is the leader of the Democrats with Bill.
[26:07.100 --> 26:09.980]  They really are globalist puppets,
[26:09.980 --> 26:11.580]  but they know where all the bodies are buried.
[26:11.580 --> 26:13.260]  They're kind of like free agents.
[26:14.180 --> 26:16.980]  And so she's refusing to step down.
[26:16.980 --> 26:19.420]  And yes, folks, that's the word from our sources
[26:19.420 --> 26:20.500]  that they've already told Hillary,
[26:20.500 --> 26:23.100]  we need to do something now, we need to punt now
[26:23.100 --> 26:26.260]  and Hillary is not doing it.
[26:26.260 --> 26:28.940]  So we have this total facade moment
[26:28.940 --> 26:30.220]  where it just blows over.
[26:32.420 --> 26:33.780]  It's like a billboard that looks like a house,
[26:33.780 --> 26:35.300]  but a big wind comes by and it blows over
[26:35.300 --> 26:36.260]  and you go, oh, that was the billboard.
[26:36.260 --> 26:37.180]  It was an optical illusion.
[26:37.180 --> 26:38.180]  That's already happened.
[26:38.180 --> 26:39.900]  What do they do?
[26:39.900 --> 26:41.700]  What are they going to pull next?
[26:42.660 --> 26:45.380]  Look, if they'll cut a video and deceive their viewers
[26:45.380 --> 26:47.820]  and say nothing really happened, they'll do anything.
[26:49.020 --> 26:51.780]  They've lied so many times, they don't care anymore.
[26:51.780 --> 26:55.580]  And just like North Koreans compete with each other
[26:55.580 --> 26:59.220]  to see who can grovel more to the dear leader,
[26:59.220 --> 27:01.380]  these sycophantic TV hosts do it,
[27:01.380 --> 27:03.500]  but more and more people like Dr. Drew won't do it.
[27:03.500 --> 27:05.340]  And Sanjay Gupta, to his credit,
[27:05.340 --> 27:07.540]  says these aren't medical records she just released.
[27:07.540 --> 27:09.100]  She's clearly got serious medical problems.
[27:09.100 --> 27:10.260]  There's a cover-up going on.
[27:10.260 --> 27:12.100]  I guess he'll be fired next.
[27:13.180 --> 27:14.260]  But he's going to fire everybody
[27:14.260 --> 27:16.420]  because they tell the truth.
[27:16.420 --> 27:17.500]  Where's Rachel Manow?
[27:17.500 --> 27:19.100]  Where is Anderson Cooper?
[27:19.100 --> 27:21.740]  Where are all these people now that just a week ago
[27:21.740 --> 27:25.980]  were attaching me by name and saying that I was a liar
[27:25.980 --> 27:28.180]  and that I had just made up health problems
[27:28.180 --> 27:29.260]  that didn't exist.
[27:30.820 --> 27:34.660]  She was in the hospital for a year in 2012 and 13,
[27:34.660 --> 27:35.500]  off and on.
[27:37.100 --> 27:41.060]  No one is the creator of the conspiracy theory.
[27:41.060 --> 27:44.460]  Her health history and her looking so ill
[27:44.460 --> 27:46.700]  and her dodging all those subpoenas
[27:46.700 --> 27:49.500]  and her doddering around and clearly declining,
[27:49.500 --> 27:51.180]  that's where the story came from.
[27:51.180 --> 27:53.620]  Yes, Matt Drudge was the first to ask the question,
[27:54.620 --> 27:55.620]  is she sick?
[27:55.620 --> 27:56.900]  Because you could see her in testimony,
[27:56.900 --> 27:59.700]  she looked like a truck had run her over.
[27:59.700 --> 28:01.500]  Hillary Clinton looks pretty good, looks healthy.
[28:01.500 --> 28:02.700]  I wouldn't call her an attractive woman,
[28:02.700 --> 28:06.380]  but energy, spunky, pre-2012.
[28:07.260 --> 28:09.060]  She's running around overthrowing innocent countries,
[28:09.060 --> 28:11.140]  murdering people, making jokes about it,
[28:11.140 --> 28:12.620]  good old witch criminal.
[28:12.620 --> 28:17.060]  And then the hand of doom keeps up with her actions
[28:17.060 --> 28:20.940]  and she runs into that brick wall and boom,
[28:20.940 --> 28:22.140]  she's not as arrogant anymore.
[28:22.140 --> 28:24.220]  And Matt Drudge starts putting up the picture
[28:24.220 --> 28:25.380]  saying, is Hillary sick?
[28:25.380 --> 28:27.900]  And the media goes, oh, how ridiculous is Hillary sick?
[28:27.900 --> 28:30.300]  Then she disappears for a year.
[28:30.300 --> 28:32.060]  Drudge keeps saying, where's Hillary?
[28:32.060 --> 28:35.060]  And they're like, oh, that cook over there
[28:35.060 --> 28:36.700]  that is asking where Hillary is.
[28:36.700 --> 28:38.060]  I mean, anyone could look at her
[28:38.060 --> 28:39.780]  and say she looks like a cancer patient
[28:39.780 --> 28:41.020]  because that's the word.
[28:42.420 --> 28:45.620]  And now when we come back, here's the big story.
[28:45.620 --> 28:49.420]  Hacked emails, we've got them.
[28:49.420 --> 28:51.980]  Right Bart's got them, it's up on infowars.com
[28:51.980 --> 28:55.420]  of Colin Powell, former secretary of state,
[28:55.420 --> 28:58.100]  talking to the former defense secretary of Canada.
[29:01.300 --> 29:05.300]  And he's in there talking about all sorts of stuff
[29:05.300 --> 29:06.780]  about how sick she is.
[29:06.780 --> 29:08.180]  But then if you go past that,
[29:08.180 --> 29:10.180]  the latest emails are the Bohemian Grove,
[29:11.300 --> 29:13.740]  the big Republican Shindig, the establishment Republican,
[29:13.740 --> 29:15.980]  the leftist Republican Shindig.
[29:15.980 --> 29:17.140]  And I mean, when I say leftist,
[29:17.140 --> 29:18.260]  I mean, Nixon had the name for it.
[29:18.260 --> 29:19.660]  And that's fine, you know,
[29:19.660 --> 29:20.980]  consenting adults can do whatever they want.
[29:20.980 --> 29:23.260]  But it's basically, at least a few weeks out of the year,
[29:23.260 --> 29:24.460]  a big gay orgy.
[29:24.460 --> 29:25.900]  Believe me, I've been there.
[29:25.900 --> 29:28.500]  They were chasing me around whistling at me.
[29:28.500 --> 29:31.060]  No, I know, I know, it sounds crazy.
[29:32.260 --> 29:33.900]  A lot of new viewers and listeners don't know that.
[29:33.900 --> 29:35.540]  It's pretty famous.
[29:35.540 --> 29:36.860]  There's been TV shows, history channels,
[29:36.860 --> 29:38.420]  discovery channel about it.
[29:38.420 --> 29:40.060]  But that's a whole other separate issue.
[29:40.060 --> 29:42.380]  We're gonna come back and cover all this straight ahead
[29:42.380 --> 29:43.780]  because it's very, very important
[29:43.780 --> 29:45.700]  that this is more proof the establishment
[29:45.700 --> 29:48.180]  absolutely hates Donald J. Trump.
[29:48.180 --> 29:49.340]  I mean, this is beautiful.
[29:50.500 --> 29:54.380]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[29:54.380 --> 29:57.340]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:01.340 --> 30:04.300]  Every four years, the American Society of Civil Engineers
[30:04.300 --> 30:06.980]  gives the U.S. infrastructure a report card.
[30:06.980 --> 30:08.660]  This report card depicts the condition
[30:08.660 --> 30:10.900]  and performance of America's infrastructure,
[30:10.900 --> 30:13.460]  assigning a letter grade based on the physical condition
[30:13.460 --> 30:15.180]  of our most basic structures.
[30:15.180 --> 30:18.460]  America's infrastructure GPA this year is a D plus,
[30:18.460 --> 30:20.220]  in other words, barely passing.
[30:20.220 --> 30:21.940]  Nothing reflects this rating more so
[30:21.940 --> 30:24.580]  than what happened to one Chicago Metro rider
[30:24.580 --> 30:27.020]  she's recovering at home after she was hit in the head
[30:27.020 --> 30:28.860]  by falling debris at Union Station,
[30:28.860 --> 30:30.580]  literally cracking her skull.
[30:30.580 --> 30:32.660]  The accident highlights a severe problem
[30:32.660 --> 30:34.220]  and she wants other Metro riders
[30:34.220 --> 30:35.820]  to be aware of what happened to her.
[30:35.820 --> 30:37.260]  It was several pounds of concrete,
[30:37.260 --> 30:38.780]  in fact, falling from a ceiling.
[30:38.780 --> 30:41.580]  Another rider who writes for the Chicago Sun Times said,
[30:41.580 --> 30:44.060]  what really bothered me was that Amtrak wouldn't say
[30:44.060 --> 30:45.500]  how often this happens.
[30:45.500 --> 30:47.860]  Three tracks were shut down for repairs to be made
[30:47.860 --> 30:50.180]  so that normal train operations can resume,
[30:50.180 --> 30:52.980]  in other words, keeping that D rating intact.
[30:52.980 --> 30:55.340]  This puts millions of American lives at risk every day
[30:55.340 --> 30:57.980]  who depend on these structures for basic survival.
[30:57.980 --> 31:01.180]  I'm Margaret Hall reporting for infowars.com.
[31:01.180 --> 31:02.940]  We're selling a product, DNA Force,
[31:02.940 --> 31:06.260]  that is the very best nutraceutical
[31:06.260 --> 31:08.220]  that we can produce about a group
[31:08.220 --> 31:10.900]  you took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[31:10.900 --> 31:12.820]  It's been something that I've been working on
[31:12.820 --> 31:14.460]  for a long time, Alex, because I think
[31:14.460 --> 31:16.500]  it's very, very important.
[31:16.500 --> 31:19.780]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates,
[31:19.780 --> 31:22.620]  we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[31:22.620 --> 31:25.860]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[31:25.860 --> 31:27.580]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[31:27.580 --> 31:29.500]  We chose the PQQ because it has over
[31:29.500 --> 31:31.820]  175 different clinical trials.
[31:31.820 --> 31:34.820]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[31:34.820 --> 31:36.460]  It works like an antioxidant.
[31:36.460 --> 31:39.900]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[31:39.900 --> 31:42.500]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[31:42.500 --> 31:43.540]  It can powder form.
[31:43.540 --> 31:46.300]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[31:46.300 --> 31:47.100]  I take this.
[31:47.100 --> 31:48.900]  This is the product that I take.
[31:48.900 --> 31:51.660]  infowarslife.com, and the profit we make.
[31:51.660 --> 31:52.500]  We fight the global.
[31:52.500 --> 31:53.620]  If we fight the new world order.
[31:53.620 --> 31:56.980]  Secure your DNA Force today at infowarslife.com,
[31:56.980 --> 32:00.980]  or call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[32:00.980 --> 32:03.020]  Not a group you developed living defense for us.
[32:03.020 --> 32:04.300]  It took you over a year to do it.
[32:04.300 --> 32:05.500]  Why is this so good?
[32:05.500 --> 32:07.660]  Because people are actually waking up
[32:07.660 --> 32:10.820]  to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[32:10.820 --> 32:13.860]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins
[32:13.860 --> 32:16.020]  from food and water and beverages in my system.
[32:16.020 --> 32:19.940]  But right now, we're dealing with massive parasites,
[32:19.940 --> 32:22.540]  which is anything that's harmful to your body
[32:22.540 --> 32:24.300]  that lives off a host mechanism.
[32:24.300 --> 32:28.100]  Right now, with all the refugees spreading disease around,
[32:28.100 --> 32:30.660]  we have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[32:30.660 --> 32:31.980]  These are all parasites.
[32:31.980 --> 32:33.100]  Tell us about all the stuff you said.
[32:33.100 --> 32:34.460]  There's so many things that are in it.
[32:34.460 --> 32:35.660]  You have the neem in there.
[32:35.660 --> 32:38.860]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[32:38.860 --> 32:42.180]  I recommend doing the parasite plans at least twice a year.
[32:42.180 --> 32:43.900]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in,
[32:43.900 --> 32:45.300]  because I'm going back on it today.
[32:45.300 --> 32:46.300]  It just came back in yesterday.
[32:46.300 --> 32:48.260]  Living Defense, infowarslife.com.
[32:48.260 --> 32:49.620]  And folks, you can't lose.
[32:49.620 --> 32:51.860]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[32:51.860 --> 32:55.220]  And you support the broadcast, infowarslife.com.
[32:55.220 --> 32:57.500]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[32:57.500 --> 32:58.700]  Thank you so much for all your work,
[32:58.700 --> 33:00.100]  sir, on this great product.
[33:00.100 --> 33:10.500]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center
[33:10.500 --> 33:12.780]  in the heart of the Resistance.
[33:12.780 --> 33:16.380]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:16.380 --> 33:18.820]  So here's the bottom line, and then I'm plunging into the news,
[33:18.820 --> 33:19.740]  and then your phone calls.
[33:19.740 --> 33:22.580]  I'll give the number out here in a moment.
[33:22.580 --> 33:24.860]  The special interests are so entitled,
[33:24.860 --> 33:28.740]  like social justice warriors, that on a massive scale,
[33:28.740 --> 33:30.900]  that they really think the presidency,
[33:30.900 --> 33:33.700]  and the Congress, and the country belongs to them.
[33:33.700 --> 33:36.180]  They really think they're big, inventive geniuses
[33:36.180 --> 33:39.780]  to sell our jobs off to China and set up trade deals
[33:39.780 --> 33:41.460]  where we can't compete.
[33:41.460 --> 33:43.940]  And then, wow, they've got a deal with the Chinese general
[33:43.940 --> 33:45.220]  they've had going for 30 years,
[33:45.220 --> 33:47.980]  and ha, ha, ha, you know, make a billion dollars,
[33:47.980 --> 33:49.780]  and then Buffy can go to the best schools,
[33:49.780 --> 33:52.820]  and boy, aren't we Ivy League geniuses.
[33:52.820 --> 33:55.380]  No, you're called traders.
[33:55.380 --> 34:00.100]  You're called pieces of trash, and let's be clear,
[34:00.100 --> 34:04.380]  it isn't like you sold out to some superior empire
[34:04.380 --> 34:06.260]  that was gonna come and make things better.
[34:06.260 --> 34:10.380]  You wanna make things worse in your cosmology of eugenics,
[34:10.380 --> 34:13.140]  because that's how you manage us.
[34:14.820 --> 34:16.460]  The truth is, we're coming down fast,
[34:16.460 --> 34:20.660]  but we're miles above you, and your attempt
[34:20.660 --> 34:23.580]  to dominate the human spirit is your greatest crime,
[34:23.580 --> 34:25.260]  and you have failed.
[34:25.260 --> 34:29.100]  The cracks in your defense system are irrevocable.
[34:31.100 --> 34:35.100]  The gravity pull of liberty will now crush you.
[34:36.580 --> 34:38.940]  The question is, how long is it gonna take
[34:38.940 --> 34:40.260]  until you surrender?
[34:43.500 --> 34:44.740]  Now, I wanna be clear.
[34:46.180 --> 34:47.940]  I'm not pushing something else,
[34:47.940 --> 34:52.540]  I'm not pushing some utopia here.
[34:52.540 --> 34:53.780]  The global is pushing utopia,
[34:53.780 --> 34:55.380]  which is actually a dystopic nightmare,
[34:55.380 --> 34:58.260]  if you really look at it and study their own plants.
[34:58.260 --> 35:01.060]  A utopia for them, they say, sounds like a nightmare,
[35:01.060 --> 35:04.780]  but a true dystopic system for us.
[35:06.340 --> 35:08.540]  So these special interests think you belong to them,
[35:08.540 --> 35:12.180]  and they've projected a spirit of sleep,
[35:12.180 --> 35:16.660]  a spirit of delusion, a spirit of pettiness.
[35:16.660 --> 35:20.020]  They've created the most empty, ugly culture they can,
[35:20.020 --> 35:22.020]  and as declassified, they did it on purpose,
[35:23.660 --> 35:25.260]  working with the big foundations,
[35:25.260 --> 35:30.020]  working with Hollywood to kill the beauty in your soul.
[35:32.660 --> 35:37.660]  And you could say we've been in a desert period,
[35:38.700 --> 35:40.980]  very arid, very dry, very hot, not a lot of life,
[35:40.980 --> 35:44.660]  but here comes the rain, here she comes again.
[35:44.660 --> 35:48.700]  I love the rain, I love the rain.
[35:50.020 --> 35:52.380]  And you watch the life come back to the desert,
[35:52.380 --> 35:54.020]  and that bloom, there's nothing more beautiful
[35:54.020 --> 35:55.860]  than a desert spring.
[35:59.020 --> 36:02.580]  When the floods come and wash away,
[36:04.460 --> 36:09.060]  the detritus, there won't be a utopia
[36:09.060 --> 36:10.020]  on the other side of that,
[36:10.020 --> 36:14.660]  but it's damn close compared to the New World Order system.
[36:16.740 --> 36:19.540]  And we have a lot to repair, humanity is damaged.
[36:21.100 --> 36:24.780]  In fact, we're far, far from completing this war,
[36:24.780 --> 36:28.460]  but I can tell you, the tide has turned.
[36:29.620 --> 36:32.420]  So make no mistake, how bad things get in the future.
[36:34.140 --> 36:36.300]  What matters is this species on the other side
[36:36.300 --> 36:39.220]  is gonna make it through it with God's help,
[36:39.220 --> 36:41.700]  with your prayers and your action.
[36:44.500 --> 36:47.340]  So I wanna open the phones up for callers,
[36:47.340 --> 36:50.500]  specifically on the wide, huge thoroughfare
[36:50.500 --> 36:52.740]  of this election, the state of the world.
[36:53.860 --> 36:55.340]  I think they're gonna pull some false flags,
[36:55.340 --> 36:56.780]  I think they're gonna pull an assassination attempt
[36:56.780 --> 36:59.180]  on Hillary, I'm telling you, I just feel it.
[37:00.660 --> 37:02.060]  Just wow.
[37:03.060 --> 37:05.260]  But I don't even have anxiety anymore,
[37:05.260 --> 37:06.660]  because I felt it building the last few years,
[37:06.660 --> 37:08.220]  you all felt it now.
[37:08.220 --> 37:10.340]  There's not even more anxiety because we're in the battle,
[37:10.340 --> 37:13.900]  it's like, it's on, we're here.
[37:18.900 --> 37:22.060]  And it's a spirit, spirit of liberty
[37:22.980 --> 37:26.100]  versus a spirit of oppression, spirit of tyranny.
[37:27.100 --> 37:32.020]  And a lot of people think they're Christians,
[37:32.020 --> 37:35.260]  but they can't really be in the presence of real freedom,
[37:35.260 --> 37:36.700]  to be in the presence of real liberty,
[37:36.700 --> 37:40.860]  to be in the presence of God, because it's too big,
[37:40.860 --> 37:44.340]  it's too deep, it's too wide, it's too complex,
[37:44.340 --> 37:46.660]  it's too frightening to them,
[37:46.660 --> 37:48.940]  because I guess their timid souls
[37:52.300 --> 37:53.620]  just can't handle the truth.
[37:57.780 --> 38:00.820]  They're not designed, some of these people,
[38:00.820 --> 38:05.020]  to drink from these waters, and so they'll never know.
[38:05.020 --> 38:07.660]  And I personally sit there and try to understand
[38:07.660 --> 38:10.980]  the mystery of Calvinistic thinking,
[38:10.980 --> 38:13.540]  and I don't particularly think that that thought
[38:13.540 --> 38:16.580]  of Calvinism is complete or absolutely correct,
[38:16.580 --> 38:19.540]  whereas you're predestined, but also have free will.
[38:24.220 --> 38:27.980]  But these people have a will to hurt innocence
[38:27.980 --> 38:30.300]  and a will to try to make people poor,
[38:30.300 --> 38:35.300]  and a will to try to pull things down, they're demonic.
[38:37.780 --> 38:40.140]  And again, I have hundreds of stories, incredible news,
[38:40.140 --> 38:44.340]  but I just get back to the Bedrock Foundation here,
[38:44.340 --> 38:48.500]  that the globalists really are horrible,
[38:48.500 --> 38:53.500]  evil, wicked, despicable, jealous, envious creatures
[38:53.460 --> 38:56.260]  that really do just wanna overthrow creation.
[38:56.260 --> 38:59.700]  I mean, look at how they attack
[38:59.700 --> 39:03.540]  the sacred union of man and woman.
[39:06.460 --> 39:09.260]  That deepest, oldest of bonds that took us
[39:09.260 --> 39:12.940]  in our ancestors through all of the incredible tribulations
[39:12.940 --> 39:16.180]  this species has faced, the bonds that were forged,
[39:16.180 --> 39:18.060]  the oaths that were sworn.
[39:20.660 --> 39:22.860]  And we see the globalists destroying our families,
[39:22.860 --> 39:27.420]  destroying our children, attacking such a noble species
[39:27.420 --> 39:32.420]  as ours, trying to make us ennoble
[39:33.500 --> 39:37.300]  so that these creatures can feel better about themselves,
[39:38.300 --> 39:39.620]  because when they look at us,
[39:39.620 --> 39:44.100]  when these psychopaths look at us, they feel low,
[39:44.100 --> 39:45.100]  because they are low.
[39:47.700 --> 39:49.260]  All right, let me get to some of these news stories.
[39:49.260 --> 39:51.620]  There's a lot of them here, but I mean, I tell you,
[39:51.620 --> 39:56.020]  I look at Hillary Clinton, and I look at an arrogant,
[39:58.340 --> 40:01.020]  power-tripping servant of darkness,
[40:01.020 --> 40:05.100]  chosen by spiders far more wicked than her,
[40:07.380 --> 40:11.660]  to command the forces of evil.
[40:15.780 --> 40:16.700]  Don't you think the globalists
[40:16.700 --> 40:19.220]  would have wanna find someone better spoken,
[40:19.220 --> 40:22.380]  better looking, more honorable to lead their system,
[40:22.380 --> 40:25.820]  but they can't find people who are honorable to do it.
[40:25.820 --> 40:28.420]  They will not do it, they cannot do it.
[40:30.180 --> 40:34.540]  And so we have Crohn's, like Madeleine Albright
[40:34.540 --> 40:39.540]  visited upon us, zero honor in her body,
[40:41.300 --> 40:45.260]  shaved from the Nazis by the Serbs,
[40:45.260 --> 40:48.780]  lived there until she was a teenager,
[40:53.260 --> 40:56.860]  and then ran to the United States like George Soros
[40:56.860 --> 41:00.020]  with stolen Jewish loot,
[41:00.020 --> 41:02.860]  loot that her father stole from Jews.
[41:04.460 --> 41:06.700]  Think about this, think of these people.
[41:06.700 --> 41:09.660]  We have Madeleine Albright, who was just like George Soros.
[41:09.660 --> 41:14.660]  She has been caught with $10 million paintings
[41:16.860 --> 41:19.260]  in her house stolen from Jews that were killed.
[41:20.620 --> 41:22.220]  She's a Jew.
[41:22.220 --> 41:26.380]  She gets on TV and says 500,000 dead Iraqis
[41:26.380 --> 41:28.700]  are a good price to pay, really being herself,
[41:28.700 --> 41:29.660]  Iraqi children.
[41:31.100 --> 41:34.020]  But we cue that up, I think you reminded me
[41:34.020 --> 41:35.540]  of what you put up on screen.
[41:35.540 --> 41:40.540]  I mean, just imagine, you like broker all these Jews
[41:40.660 --> 41:42.500]  trying to get off for the Nazis, double cross them,
[41:42.500 --> 41:46.300]  kill them, get their family jewels.
[41:50.420 --> 41:52.980]  Their real family jewels are sent off to be killed.
[41:52.980 --> 41:55.380]  You get all the loot, and then you run to Serbia
[41:55.380 --> 41:59.060]  and they save you, and then you come and run bombing
[41:59.060 --> 42:01.220]  campaigns against them to bring Muslims in.
[42:01.220 --> 42:03.420]  It's like, oh, here, let me save you, Madeleine.
[42:03.420 --> 42:06.780]  Oh, thank you, ah, I mean, it's like,
[42:06.780 --> 42:08.100]  and you say this doesn't make sense,
[42:08.100 --> 42:10.020]  why attack the people that save you?
[42:10.020 --> 42:12.340]  That's because it's evil, it's like even sicker
[42:12.340 --> 42:17.340]  and more fun to screw over the people that saved you.
[42:17.820 --> 42:19.020]  See how that works?
[42:19.900 --> 42:21.580]  And so you start getting into their mindset,
[42:21.580 --> 42:26.340]  you go, oh my God, these people are literal spawn of hell.
[42:26.340 --> 42:29.540]  I mean, the whole world, from the Japanese,
[42:29.540 --> 42:32.340]  to the Russians, to the French, to people in African countries
[42:32.340 --> 42:33.780]  who come and see America and say,
[42:33.780 --> 42:34.900]  these people are incredible.
[42:34.900 --> 42:37.260]  They don't put up with crap, you know, people stand up,
[42:37.260 --> 42:39.180]  people are involved, people kill each other in the streets,
[42:39.180 --> 42:41.420]  whatever, doesn't matter, we're real.
[42:41.420 --> 42:43.740]  And then she gets all this power being brought up
[42:43.740 --> 42:46.060]  in this system, and then she hates it.
[42:46.060 --> 42:47.580]  And she's like, I don't care, I don't care,
[42:47.580 --> 42:50.180]  I don't care, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care.
[42:50.180 --> 42:52.340]  I don't care, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care.
[42:52.340 --> 42:55.340]  I don't care, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care.
[42:55.340 --> 42:57.180]  And then she hates it.
[42:57.180 --> 43:02.020]  She hates the very environment that gave her all this power.
[43:03.900 --> 43:08.380]  It's like the devil created the most beautiful, powerful,
[43:08.380 --> 43:11.100]  second, you know, second only to God.
[43:13.460 --> 43:15.500]  But then Lucifer looks at God and says,
[43:15.500 --> 43:17.540]  but you're everything, I could never even be you,
[43:17.540 --> 43:19.660]  so I wanna go make my own thing.
[43:19.660 --> 43:22.020]  I wanna go, but you can't even make anything, Lucifer.
[43:22.020 --> 43:25.620]  She had to go hijack something else God made.
[43:25.620 --> 43:28.700]  And God sits back and says, okay, you go ahead and try to
[43:28.700 --> 43:30.740]  break my creation that's made in my image.
[43:30.740 --> 43:32.460]  And that's why Lucifer doesn't like us, folks,
[43:32.460 --> 43:34.300]  because we're made, and you can see it all,
[43:34.300 --> 43:38.700]  what we build, what we do in the image of the entity
[43:38.700 --> 43:41.100]  that created everything.
[43:41.980 --> 43:44.060]  And we're just larvae right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[43:44.060 --> 43:46.620]  We're being tested, we're being prepared.
[43:46.620 --> 43:48.340]  We're in boot camp right now.
[43:49.540 --> 43:50.500]  These people think they're winners,
[43:50.500 --> 43:52.220]  they went and sold out to the beast system,
[43:52.220 --> 43:53.900]  they sold out to the New World Order.
[43:54.860 --> 43:57.660]  They think they're getting ahead because they're part of that.
[44:00.300 --> 44:01.300]  You just failed.
[44:02.220 --> 44:05.500]  Big, fat, F minus.
[44:05.500 --> 44:07.420]  A big, fat, zero.
[44:09.420 --> 44:14.420]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
[44:15.260 --> 44:16.100]  It's amazing.
[44:17.220 --> 44:19.100]  The eye's not seen, the ear's not heard,
[44:19.100 --> 44:20.460]  what God's got in store for us.
[44:20.460 --> 44:22.860]  Can you imagine the other side, the next level?
[44:24.020 --> 44:26.300]  This level's pretty amazing right here, I gotta tell you,
[44:26.300 --> 44:29.500]  but I just love God, and no matter what happens to me,
[44:29.500 --> 44:31.420]  I know it's all part of God's plan,
[44:31.420 --> 44:34.260]  and I have total faith in God, total faith.
[44:36.660 --> 44:39.020]  And when I was like two, three years old,
[44:39.020 --> 44:41.660]  I would get so sad thinking about starving children
[44:41.660 --> 44:45.780]  around the world, and I wasn't even watching shows about that.
[44:45.780 --> 44:47.860]  I could just feel the suffering when I was a little child,
[44:47.860 --> 44:52.660]  and I just prayed to God that some day,
[44:52.660 --> 44:57.660]  somehow we could try to take more suffering out of the world.
[44:59.220 --> 45:02.180]  And I thought growing up, everybody was like me.
[45:02.180 --> 45:05.060]  I thought everybody wanted to help others.
[45:05.060 --> 45:06.380]  Let's see, when people have been infected
[45:06.380 --> 45:10.140]  by this global system, they're not even conscious anymore.
[45:10.140 --> 45:12.620]  They're like running a satanic program in their brain,
[45:12.620 --> 45:16.380]  and all they want to do is hurt people.
[45:20.300 --> 45:22.980]  We have Albright Clip, here is Madeline Albright,
[45:22.980 --> 45:26.940]  talking about 500,000 children dying with sanctions.
[45:27.900 --> 45:29.700]  There's a good price to pay, here it is.
[45:32.140 --> 45:35.500]  We have heard that a half a million children have died.
[45:35.500 --> 45:40.500]  I mean, that's more children than died in Hiroshima.
[45:40.500 --> 45:44.820]  And is the price worth it?
[45:44.820 --> 45:47.140]  I think this is a very hard choice,
[45:47.140 --> 45:49.780]  but the price we think the price is worth it.
[45:50.660 --> 45:52.060]  Now, you have to understand,
[45:52.060 --> 45:53.500]  and then she goes on from there,
[45:53.500 --> 45:55.140]  her stability quote in the Gulf.
[45:55.980 --> 45:58.100]  That was back when even the corrupt twisted media
[45:58.100 --> 45:59.500]  was still a little bit more honest,
[45:59.500 --> 46:00.740]  because they at least pretended
[46:00.740 --> 46:02.420]  they weren't deceptive to themselves.
[46:04.140 --> 46:06.340]  Nowadays, they just wouldn't even show that clip.
[46:06.340 --> 46:11.340]  And the media thinks it's like winning,
[46:14.180 --> 46:17.660]  because it goes along with this when it's destroying itself.
[46:17.660 --> 46:18.700]  I have another clip.
[46:18.700 --> 46:23.260]  This is Congressman Sheffitz, who I like more and more,
[46:24.180 --> 46:26.020]  with the FBI yesterday.
[46:26.020 --> 46:27.220]  We already played a clip of this yesterday,
[46:27.220 --> 46:29.420]  but I wanted to play this particular clip
[46:29.420 --> 46:33.380]  where he says to the FBI agent that's in there testifying
[46:33.380 --> 46:36.740]  and won't give Congress the field reports, the 302s.
[46:37.980 --> 46:39.180]  And the longer clip explains,
[46:39.180 --> 46:42.340]  listen, we make the laws, this is Congress.
[46:42.340 --> 46:44.540]  So we're not doing a four year request
[46:44.540 --> 46:47.940]  for the judicial committee, sir.
[46:47.940 --> 46:48.980]  You're going to give it, in fact,
[46:48.980 --> 46:51.420]  here's your subpoena right now, and this is so good.
[46:51.420 --> 46:53.300]  This is Congress waking back up.
[46:53.300 --> 46:54.980]  Now, if you think it's bad to have the FBI
[46:54.980 --> 46:57.820]  under the orders of Loretta Lynch and others,
[46:57.820 --> 46:59.460]  one of that's who's running the FBI right now.
[46:59.460 --> 47:04.460]  If you think that's bad, what about Obama saying
[47:04.500 --> 47:06.060]  it's the authority to attack countries
[47:06.060 --> 47:07.500]  from NATO, not Congress?
[47:10.260 --> 47:11.100]  And the Congressman go,
[47:11.100 --> 47:12.260]  I don't think I'm even hearing this
[47:12.260 --> 47:15.140]  when I'm hearing right now, are you joking?
[47:15.140 --> 47:16.860]  And you see, that's why England,
[47:16.860 --> 47:19.220]  who's been big war mongering group,
[47:19.220 --> 47:20.220]  and then a lot of bad things,
[47:20.220 --> 47:21.620]  finally to the right thing a few years ago
[47:21.620 --> 47:23.420]  and said, we're not attacking Syria.
[47:26.340 --> 47:28.460]  They finally, and that's what they say,
[47:28.460 --> 47:30.060]  is the big joke at the end of the day,
[47:30.060 --> 47:31.580]  is that even though England's brutal
[47:31.580 --> 47:33.540]  and has a lot of serious problems,
[47:33.540 --> 47:37.140]  little bit soft heart at the end, which is good.
[47:37.140 --> 47:39.020]  You got a soft heart for a reason.
[47:39.020 --> 47:41.460]  You don't turn into Hillary Clinton.
[47:41.460 --> 47:43.540]  Have a big rock for a heart
[47:43.540 --> 47:45.740]  and project onto me that I have a dark heart.
[47:49.140 --> 47:51.060]  But they said, really,
[47:51.060 --> 47:53.820]  they're going to exterminate and decrishonize Syria?
[47:54.900 --> 47:55.940]  That's what this thing is.
[47:55.940 --> 47:57.580]  This is Saudi Arabia.
[47:57.580 --> 47:59.060]  We've already tried it three different times.
[47:59.060 --> 48:00.740]  It's killing every Christian they can.
[48:00.740 --> 48:02.540]  Obama won't let him out of the country.
[48:02.540 --> 48:07.180]  It's 0.4, 0.4% Christians they let out
[48:07.180 --> 48:08.980]  when the population was 20%.
[48:08.980 --> 48:10.020]  They're not letting Christians out.
[48:10.020 --> 48:11.700]  It's a death trap.
[48:11.700 --> 48:14.780]  And then Obama gave a speech a year ago or so
[48:14.780 --> 48:16.020]  that told me everything I needed to know.
[48:16.020 --> 48:18.300]  I thought, we got to find the clip played again.
[48:18.300 --> 48:20.220]  He relishes, he goes, listen,
[48:20.220 --> 48:22.660]  I can't do a good Obama impression, but listen,
[48:22.660 --> 48:26.260]  you know, we just can't only let Christians in.
[48:26.260 --> 48:28.020]  We got to be fair and let, you know, Muslims in,
[48:28.020 --> 48:30.340]  you know, from this region who've been hurt.
[48:30.340 --> 48:31.860]  They don't let Shiites in.
[48:33.220 --> 48:35.700]  Less than 1%, even though Shiites are 20%
[48:35.700 --> 48:38.100]  or more in Syria, 20% worldwide.
[48:38.100 --> 48:40.660]  I think it's like 30 something percent in Syria.
[48:40.660 --> 48:42.660]  They don't let, but maybe 1% of them in
[48:42.660 --> 48:43.660]  and it's 0.4.
[48:43.660 --> 48:45.660]  Look it up, Christians.
[48:45.660 --> 48:47.260]  They don't let them out.
[48:47.260 --> 48:48.340]  They're killing them.
[48:49.380 --> 48:51.900]  And of course, the MI6 went in there
[48:51.900 --> 48:52.740]  and they actually braved them.
[48:52.740 --> 48:54.260]  They said, this is the US plan.
[48:54.260 --> 48:55.500]  This is what's going on.
[48:55.500 --> 48:58.700]  We're conducting a genocide,
[48:58.700 --> 49:01.500]  just like the Armenian genocide that the Turks conducted.
[49:03.100 --> 49:05.780]  And the House of Commons said,
[49:05.780 --> 49:07.660]  we're not going to be part of that.
[49:10.540 --> 49:14.300]  See, it's gotten so evil now that they march in and say,
[49:14.300 --> 49:17.900]  the operation to decristionize Syria is ongoing, Commander.
[49:17.900 --> 49:20.100]  We only need the funding for the next flotilla
[49:20.100 --> 49:21.580]  and the attack fleets already.
[49:21.580 --> 49:23.340]  They're like, we're killing all the Christians.
[49:23.340 --> 49:26.740]  Yes, as part of the organized program launched by Lord Soros.
[49:26.740 --> 49:28.900]  I mean, this is what's going on behind the scenes.
[49:28.900 --> 49:31.980]  They're like, well, certainly you agree to the plan.
[49:31.980 --> 49:34.780]  We've launched it against Russia as well.
[49:34.780 --> 49:37.300]  Our programs are going well in the schools here.
[49:37.300 --> 49:40.180]  The nation is almost 100% anti-Christian now.
[49:43.540 --> 49:46.060]  And they're sitting back at their chairs going,
[49:46.060 --> 49:48.020]  they're kind of, whoa, we actually are doing it.
[49:48.020 --> 49:50.620]  We're falling, we're killing our countries.
[49:50.620 --> 49:53.220]  We're killing the engine of our strength.
[49:53.220 --> 49:54.180]  Well, why?
[49:54.180 --> 49:55.020]  Why?
[49:55.020 --> 49:56.900]  Because it's a hunchback.
[49:56.900 --> 49:58.060]  George Soros wants to.
[49:58.060 --> 49:58.900]  That's why.
[50:04.060 --> 50:06.980]  Yeah, only 56 of a 10,000 Syrian refugees
[50:06.980 --> 50:08.500]  led into the US or Christian.
[50:11.140 --> 50:13.900]  To the math, it's 0.4% last time I did it.
[50:13.900 --> 50:14.740]  Not a changed.
[50:16.020 --> 50:18.700]  But 10,801, 56 are Christian.
[50:18.700 --> 50:22.140]  That's half of 1%.
[50:25.740 --> 50:28.420]  So now they say 0.5.
[50:28.420 --> 50:31.620]  I guess after the human cry, I'm gonna skip this break.
[50:33.220 --> 50:35.100]  Oh, it's not good to skip that music.
[50:36.300 --> 50:38.900]  This is the epic moment we have reached.
[50:42.020 --> 50:43.660]  People say to me, they either say,
[50:43.660 --> 50:46.180]  oh, you're a horrible opportunist, you're this evil person.
[50:46.180 --> 50:48.020]  Oh, lying about the loving government and the media.
[50:48.020 --> 50:49.740]  Or they say, oh, you have so much courage,
[50:49.740 --> 50:50.980]  you're so wonderful.
[50:50.980 --> 50:53.380]  We have a pack of vampires trying to take over
[50:53.380 --> 50:56.620]  and I've got courage that I'm fighting them.
[51:06.420 --> 51:08.460]  If a big mean guy busted through that door
[51:08.460 --> 51:09.660]  and was attacking people,
[51:10.940 --> 51:14.420]  I couldn't keep myself from going over and fighting them.
[51:14.420 --> 51:15.940]  And it's not because I've got courage.
[51:15.940 --> 51:17.060]  It's not because I'm a tough guy.
[51:17.060 --> 51:18.180]  It's default.
[51:23.660 --> 51:24.940]  And maybe there's something wrong with me
[51:24.940 --> 51:26.940]  because I just can't imagine running.
[51:29.220 --> 51:32.540]  But for a public that's never,
[51:32.540 --> 51:34.340]  I guess, gone through any rites of passage,
[51:34.340 --> 51:35.940]  I could see how people think running
[51:35.940 --> 51:38.540]  is the way to get away from things, but it's not.
[51:39.860 --> 51:41.620]  Because if somebody was coming to get me,
[51:41.620 --> 51:42.620]  they're gonna keep coming.
[51:42.620 --> 51:44.660]  I need to face them down.
[51:44.660 --> 51:46.220]  Now, maybe if it's not the best time
[51:46.220 --> 51:49.500]  where I could think things out, I'd slip away.
[51:49.500 --> 51:53.940]  But confronted with it head on, it's a switch, it's flipped.
[51:53.940 --> 51:55.940]  And we need to flip that switch right now.
[51:55.940 --> 51:58.500]  And sometimes I'll have family come to town
[51:58.500 --> 51:59.340]  and wherever they'll go, man,
[51:59.340 --> 52:00.620]  that's getting pretty rough on you, huh?
[52:00.620 --> 52:02.260]  I saw her on Page of the Paper
[52:02.260 --> 52:04.700]  the last three days attacking you.
[52:04.700 --> 52:05.780]  Yeah, and I saw on TV there.
[52:05.780 --> 52:08.540]  How are you holding up under it?
[52:08.540 --> 52:11.420]  I'm like fricking popping champagne bottles.
[52:11.420 --> 52:12.940]  We wanna get down to brass tacks.
[52:12.940 --> 52:15.780]  I mean, figuratively, I haven't had any champagne in a while.
[52:15.780 --> 52:20.380]  I don't really like champagne, but to have traders
[52:20.380 --> 52:23.660]  attacking you and me and Trump and everybody else,
[52:23.660 --> 52:25.940]  man, that is a great honor.
[52:29.180 --> 52:32.460]  So the toll-free number to join us on false flags,
[52:32.460 --> 52:33.780]  what is Hillary in a pool?
[52:33.780 --> 52:35.380]  You agree the facade is collapsing?
[52:35.380 --> 52:37.460]  What do you think about the next 53 days
[52:37.460 --> 52:39.260]  till this epic election?
[52:39.260 --> 52:44.180]  Super epic, I mean, gorgantuan, historical, unprecedented.
[52:44.180 --> 52:47.460]  This will be a day long remembered.
[52:47.460 --> 52:51.660]  I mean, I don't know how you highlight this as the big one.
[52:51.660 --> 52:54.340]  Most important election, I think, in US history.
[52:55.660 --> 52:56.820]  Everything on the table.
[52:56.820 --> 52:58.420]  The globalists admitting they're all in.
[52:58.420 --> 52:59.900]  World government in peril.
[52:59.900 --> 53:02.740]  They're hitting the panic alert buttons.
[53:03.940 --> 53:05.660]  And notice as we get more bold,
[53:05.660 --> 53:08.460]  good men and women in government can be more bold now.
[53:10.060 --> 53:10.900]  People always say, oh,
[53:10.900 --> 53:12.820]  and I always put something fundamental.
[53:12.820 --> 53:15.780]  I'm not kissing the butt of the government.
[53:15.780 --> 53:16.620]  I'm a constitutionalist.
[53:16.620 --> 53:19.420]  I want a very small constitutional government.
[53:19.420 --> 53:22.300]  I'm supporting and praising good people in government
[53:22.300 --> 53:25.340]  that are sending good signals, doing good things,
[53:25.340 --> 53:26.620]  putting their neck out there.
[53:26.620 --> 53:29.060]  That means those individuals.
[53:29.060 --> 53:32.940]  And quite frankly, we can get mad at TSA agents all day
[53:32.940 --> 53:36.900]  and boy have I, but as I mature, more and more,
[53:36.900 --> 53:39.580]  I just go, you know, it is the bad folks in Congress.
[53:39.580 --> 53:41.220]  And it is the people that set these policies up
[53:41.220 --> 53:42.540]  and left our borders wide open.
[53:42.540 --> 53:44.140]  That's where this started.
[53:46.980 --> 53:49.620]  So why should I just sit here
[53:49.620 --> 53:51.620]  and attack the actual TSA people?
[53:52.740 --> 53:54.220]  Because that's just a cop out.
[53:54.220 --> 53:56.060]  It's easy to attack the little TSA person.
[53:56.060 --> 53:57.900]  I need to attack myself for letting this happen.
[53:57.900 --> 54:00.100]  I need to actually go after people that did it.
[54:02.460 --> 54:06.140]  And so quite frankly, I didn't turn to the side
[54:06.140 --> 54:06.980]  of the police.
[54:06.980 --> 54:08.980]  I was never against the police.
[54:08.980 --> 54:11.380]  I was angry at seeing unconstitutional stuff happening
[54:11.380 --> 54:13.460]  and knowing the corruption of the police was happening
[54:13.460 --> 54:16.020]  by the globalists and the ADL, Southern Parvy Law Center,
[54:16.020 --> 54:17.860]  brainwashing them with anti-American,
[54:17.860 --> 54:20.980]  Soviet level, anti-free speech garbage.
[54:20.980 --> 54:23.820]  And now the police, even the FBI doesn't get their info
[54:23.820 --> 54:26.580]  from the Southern Parvy Law Center and ADL now.
[54:26.580 --> 54:28.940]  Most police departments will begrudgingly
[54:28.940 --> 54:32.100]  take the award politically, but it's a laughing stock
[54:32.100 --> 54:33.260]  and no one believes it.
[54:36.140 --> 54:39.660]  So the police on average did the right thing.
[54:39.660 --> 54:41.660]  They're for the republic, so that's good.
[54:41.660 --> 54:43.140]  And of course, George Soros wants his people
[54:43.140 --> 54:45.060]  to go shoot him in the back of the head.
[54:45.060 --> 54:47.580]  You know, that's what's going on here, folks.
[54:47.580 --> 54:49.180]  A war for the country.
[54:49.180 --> 54:51.500]  We can reform the police later,
[54:52.540 --> 54:54.580]  but you're not gonna reform them running around,
[54:54.580 --> 54:56.220]  say, and shoot them in the back of the head.
[54:56.220 --> 54:58.780]  You're gonna turn them into a paramilitary force
[54:58.780 --> 55:00.580]  that the globalists think they can then capture
[55:00.580 --> 55:02.140]  and use against the patriots.
[55:02.140 --> 55:05.500]  No, no, no, no.
[55:05.500 --> 55:08.500]  If George Soros wants you to hate the police,
[55:08.500 --> 55:09.660]  you shouldn't hate them.
[55:10.740 --> 55:13.220]  Try going up and talking to them, being nice to them,
[55:13.220 --> 55:14.180]  finding out what's going on.
[55:14.180 --> 55:15.580]  That's how we have humanity.
[55:15.580 --> 55:16.740]  That's how we change this.
[55:16.740 --> 55:18.420]  That's how we turn this around.
[55:18.420 --> 55:20.420]  That's how we defeat the new world order.
[55:27.780 --> 55:31.540]  My greatest work is with you that have magnified
[55:31.540 --> 55:34.740]  our information and helped us with the information,
[55:34.740 --> 55:36.940]  is that we really have painted a very clear picture
[55:36.940 --> 55:37.780]  of what's going on.
[55:37.780 --> 55:39.620]  And as things get revealed, people go,
[55:39.620 --> 55:41.540]  wow, it really is a clear picture.
[55:41.540 --> 55:42.620]  Alex really knew.
[55:42.620 --> 55:44.820]  Well, of course, I do this 15 hours a day.
[55:44.820 --> 55:45.980]  I interview all the top experts.
[55:45.980 --> 55:46.900]  I live this.
[55:49.020 --> 55:52.820]  And for whatever reason, genetically,
[55:52.820 --> 55:54.420]  in my whole family line on both sides,
[55:54.420 --> 55:59.420]  this is what arises every time there's a political need.
[55:59.500 --> 56:01.340]  We might go generations before there's a big crisis,
[56:01.340 --> 56:02.500]  but every time there is,
[56:02.500 --> 56:04.420]  my ancestors right back at the start
[56:04.420 --> 56:07.100]  have done things, some of them, bigger than what I've done.
[56:07.100 --> 56:09.620]  And you have that as well,
[56:09.620 --> 56:12.820]  but you have to activate the genetics you have
[56:12.820 --> 56:15.300]  to understand you already have the battle plans.
[56:16.380 --> 56:18.700]  You already know how to counter the enemy.
[56:18.700 --> 56:20.100]  You already have everything you need.
[56:20.100 --> 56:22.300]  Your ancestors already overcame things,
[56:22.300 --> 56:24.260]  in many cases, much worse than we face.
[56:26.380 --> 56:28.340]  All right, I'm gonna play this Shafiq clip
[56:28.340 --> 56:30.140]  because it's very important.
[56:30.140 --> 56:32.500]  And it's government, the real government,
[56:32.500 --> 56:34.620]  the Congress that holds the purse strings.
[56:34.620 --> 56:36.100]  Not supposed to be co-equal.
[56:36.100 --> 56:38.860]  Now they say the presidency's all powerful, the UN.
[56:38.860 --> 56:41.100]  See, they're devolving the power in the wrong direction.
[56:41.100 --> 56:42.180]  It's Congress.
[56:43.980 --> 56:45.780]  Congress, at first it's the states.
[56:46.780 --> 56:48.660]  Got about 51% of the power.
[56:48.660 --> 56:53.340]  Then at the 49%, I'd say a good 20% of that
[56:53.340 --> 56:55.420]  is supposed to really be going to Congress.
[56:55.420 --> 56:57.460]  That's what the founders said, it's how it works.
[56:57.460 --> 56:59.980]  And then it's the courts and then the president.
[56:59.980 --> 57:02.060]  The president executes.
[57:02.060 --> 57:03.060]  He's an executive.
[57:03.060 --> 57:06.660]  He executes what the board tells him to do.
[57:06.660 --> 57:09.980]  The president, the presidents don't run companies.
[57:09.980 --> 57:11.220]  That's ass backwards.
[57:13.420 --> 57:16.420]  The shareholders, we're the shareholders.
[57:16.420 --> 57:17.260]  We're the stakeholders.
[57:17.260 --> 57:18.300]  We're the Americans.
[57:18.300 --> 57:19.140]  We hold it.
[57:19.140 --> 57:20.460]  We, we do, we do.
[57:21.500 --> 57:23.780]  We're about to get a CEO, a president,
[57:23.780 --> 57:25.980]  that wants to do that, get ready to kick ass.
[57:25.980 --> 57:28.140]  He knows he's got the team that's still unstoppable,
[57:28.140 --> 57:29.940]  that they've tried to teach it's a wimp
[57:29.940 --> 57:32.940]  and to throw it and hunch over like it's a nobody.
[57:32.940 --> 57:37.940]  Truth is, 1776 is about to go supernova.
[57:38.660 --> 57:40.340]  Let's go to this clip.
[57:40.340 --> 57:43.740]  This is the House Governmental Oversight Committee
[57:43.740 --> 57:47.700]  chaired by Congressman Jason Chaffetz is furious
[57:47.700 --> 57:51.740]  that the FBI has released selected portions
[57:51.740 --> 57:53.740]  of its file about Mrs. Clinton.
[57:53.740 --> 57:56.260]  At the same time the FBI was being interrogated
[57:56.260 --> 57:58.580]  by Congressman Chaffetz, his opposite number
[57:58.580 --> 58:00.420]  in the Senate, Senator Grassley,
[58:00.420 --> 58:02.340]  the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee
[58:02.340 --> 58:04.300]  was making a speech about the same thing.
[58:04.300 --> 58:09.020]  The issue is, how did the FBI decide what to keep secret
[58:09.020 --> 58:11.380]  and what to release and how can they do that
[58:11.380 --> 58:13.140]  to the Congress?
[58:13.140 --> 58:15.020]  Will the FBI provide to Congress
[58:15.020 --> 58:17.340]  the full file with no redactions,
[58:17.340 --> 58:19.260]  a personal identifiable information?
[58:19.260 --> 58:21.460]  I cannot make that commitment sitting here today.
[58:21.460 --> 58:23.380]  Then I'm gonna issue a subpoena
[58:23.380 --> 58:25.220]  and I'm gonna do it right now.
[58:25.220 --> 58:28.580]  So let's go, I've signed this subpoena.
[58:28.580 --> 58:31.900]  We want all the 302s and we would like
[58:31.900 --> 58:33.660]  the full file.
[58:33.660 --> 58:35.940]  You can accept service on behalf of the FBI?
[58:35.940 --> 58:36.780]  Certainly.
[58:36.780 --> 58:37.900]  You are hereby served.
[58:37.900 --> 58:39.060]  You know what I like about Chaffetz?
[58:39.060 --> 58:40.540]  His hand is shaking there.
[58:40.540 --> 58:42.420]  And that's okay, because the FBI's dangerous.
[58:42.420 --> 58:45.500]  Now let's, the FBI basically runs a show in this country
[58:45.500 --> 58:47.460]  and they're run by criminals now
[58:47.460 --> 58:49.020]  and he's standing up against these criminals.
[58:49.020 --> 58:50.300]  He's got big waybos.
[58:51.300 --> 58:53.180]  Yeah, first of all I wanna say,
[58:53.180 --> 58:56.940]  Secret 12 X2 Supermail Brain Forged Prosecute Art
[58:56.940 --> 58:58.660]  Silver Bullet, I use them all.
[58:58.660 --> 58:59.620]  They're phenomenal.
[58:59.620 --> 59:01.220]  They work by involved.
[59:01.220 --> 59:02.060]  Thank you brother.
[59:02.060 --> 59:03.780]  Thank you guys for putting those out there.
[59:03.780 --> 59:06.620]  I am a relatively short time listener
[59:06.620 --> 59:10.460]  and I'm quite a supporter of your fine, fine products.
[59:10.460 --> 59:11.820]  Welcome to the Info War.
[59:11.820 --> 59:13.500]  It's so easy to get these incredible
[59:13.500 --> 59:15.540]  nutraceuticals that support your health
[59:15.540 --> 59:17.660]  and the Info War at the same time.
[59:17.660 --> 59:18.500]  I'm a nine year listener.
[59:18.500 --> 59:19.900]  I buy all the nutraceuticals,
[59:19.900 --> 59:21.820]  FUFX, Nacin, all the time.
[59:21.820 --> 59:23.060]  Why, God, let me ask you a question.
[59:23.060 --> 59:24.140]  Have they worked for you?
[59:24.140 --> 59:25.740]  They're the most unbelievable products
[59:25.740 --> 59:26.980]  I've ever had in my life.
[59:26.980 --> 59:28.260]  What products are you taking?
[59:28.260 --> 59:33.260]  Everything from Supermail to Brain Force to Winter Sun X2.
[59:34.260 --> 59:36.340]  Even got a little DNA force.
[59:36.340 --> 59:38.180]  So when I just re-upped everything
[59:38.180 --> 59:39.980]  and I just went to Autofill.
[59:39.980 --> 59:42.900]  Visit infowarslife.com to read the information
[59:42.900 --> 59:45.020]  and research and to see the reviews for yourself.
[59:45.020 --> 59:49.780]  That's infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[59:49.780 --> 59:54.780]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:03.260 --> 01:00:06.540]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:00:06.540 --> 01:00:10.180]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN radio network.
[01:00:11.300 --> 01:00:13.100]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:15.460]  Crashing the lies and disinformation.
[01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:17.820]  Okay.
[01:00:17.820 --> 01:00:21.420]  I want to go to your phone calls for the next 30 minutes
[01:00:21.420 --> 01:00:24.020]  and then Tim Kennedy is set to be coming off fight camp
[01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:25.660]  and to announce his new big fight.
[01:00:25.660 --> 01:00:29.020]  Exclusively here, other folks have kind of halfway leaked it.
[01:00:29.020 --> 01:00:30.580]  You know, they weren't supposed to till today.
[01:00:30.580 --> 01:00:33.540]  This is when he's contractually able to do it.
[01:00:33.540 --> 01:00:36.060]  It's basically Tim's belief that basically no one
[01:00:36.060 --> 01:00:38.100]  in the UFC is clean but him.
[01:00:38.100 --> 01:00:40.420]  I know personally that he's been tested
[01:00:40.420 --> 01:00:42.860]  six or seven times this year.
[01:00:42.860 --> 01:00:44.180]  In fact, in a two day period,
[01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:45.340]  he got tested four different times.
[01:00:45.340 --> 01:00:47.820]  You cannot believe the guy's clean.
[01:00:49.820 --> 01:00:51.540]  He is on super male vitality.
[01:00:51.540 --> 01:00:53.180]  And I didn't even plug anything last hour
[01:00:53.180 --> 01:00:55.140]  and I skipped a break.
[01:00:55.140 --> 01:00:57.300]  And quite frankly, I have a lot of great reporters here
[01:00:57.300 --> 01:00:59.980]  that I'd like to give bonuses to
[01:00:59.980 --> 01:01:00.860]  for the right work they're doing.
[01:01:00.860 --> 01:01:01.900]  I'd like to hire more reporters.
[01:01:01.900 --> 01:01:03.580]  I'd like to, you know, it's really important
[01:01:03.580 --> 01:01:05.540]  when you buy the books, the videos,
[01:01:05.540 --> 01:01:09.460]  the nutraceuticals, the products at infowarstore.com
[01:01:09.460 --> 01:01:12.140]  because that's what funds this operation.
[01:01:12.140 --> 01:01:15.660]  You have to understand, if we're like a fighter bomber
[01:01:15.660 --> 01:01:17.180]  flying into, you know, nuke the enemy,
[01:01:17.180 --> 01:01:19.100]  we've got to have fuel put in the engine.
[01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:20.140]  We've got to have engine parts.
[01:01:20.140 --> 01:01:22.100]  We've got to have, you know, people back there
[01:01:22.100 --> 01:01:23.540]  picking the targets on the ground.
[01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:25.300]  There's a lot of infrastructure behind things
[01:01:25.300 --> 01:01:27.060]  and you are that.
[01:01:27.060 --> 01:01:29.620]  So you really need super male vitality.
[01:01:29.620 --> 01:01:31.100]  You really need lung cleanse.
[01:01:31.100 --> 01:01:33.460]  You really need a DNA force.
[01:01:33.460 --> 01:01:36.340]  I mean, everybody really needs these products.
[01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:37.980]  I mean, I don't claim to be some beach boy
[01:01:37.980 --> 01:01:41.460]  but I got really confident because I used to run six miles
[01:01:41.460 --> 01:01:43.620]  almost every other day and lift weights
[01:01:43.620 --> 01:01:45.860]  and I was in super good shape.
[01:01:45.860 --> 01:01:50.660]  And I got into media at 21 and quit working out about 23.
[01:01:50.660 --> 01:01:53.900]  And then I gained almost 100 pounds in the next decade.
[01:01:53.900 --> 01:01:56.140]  You know, gain 10 pounds a year, boom.
[01:01:56.140 --> 01:01:58.500]  You end up, you know, you're a whale.
[01:01:58.500 --> 01:01:59.620]  And I'm not attacking people that are fat.
[01:01:59.620 --> 01:02:00.460]  I get it.
[01:02:00.460 --> 01:02:01.300]  I've been there.
[01:02:01.300 --> 01:02:02.700]  So I still got a big giant head and stuff.
[01:02:02.700 --> 01:02:04.420]  So on TV, it may not look like I've lost that much weight
[01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:07.780]  but I have lost, I got pretty close to a six pack now.
[01:02:07.780 --> 01:02:09.420]  Actually did before I went to Cleveland and I gained
[01:02:09.420 --> 01:02:11.440]  like 10 pounds, I've lost about seven pounds of it again.
[01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:13.820]  But that's right before I went to Cleveland.
[01:02:13.820 --> 01:02:16.980]  And that's working out less than I was working out
[01:02:18.620 --> 01:02:19.740]  just three, four years ago.
[01:02:19.740 --> 01:02:21.140]  It's the X2 iodine.
[01:02:21.140 --> 01:02:22.260]  It's the supermobility.
[01:02:22.260 --> 01:02:23.460]  If I just take it every day
[01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:25.740]  because I've never been a nutraceutical guy.
[01:02:25.740 --> 01:02:27.260]  And I started, you know, obviously I had sponsors
[01:02:27.260 --> 01:02:28.100]  that were funding us.
[01:02:28.100 --> 01:02:29.300]  I knew nutraceuticals were important.
[01:02:29.300 --> 01:02:31.060]  I mean, I knew supplements were important
[01:02:31.060 --> 01:02:33.180]  but I just never really got into them.
[01:02:33.180 --> 01:02:35.180]  And, you know, I was a guy that just go to the buffet
[01:02:35.180 --> 01:02:37.020]  at the cafeteria and that was my supplements.
[01:02:37.020 --> 01:02:39.700]  I'll eat, you know, five plates of food.
[01:02:39.700 --> 01:02:43.100]  But the truth is that it's changed my life.
[01:02:43.100 --> 01:02:45.860]  And I finally have gotten to where I take my products
[01:02:45.860 --> 01:02:48.660]  religiously and I give them to my kids
[01:02:48.660 --> 01:02:50.780]  and they're healthier, they're happier, you name it.
[01:02:50.780 --> 01:02:52.380]  Whether it's our sleep aid knockout
[01:02:52.380 --> 01:02:55.780]  or whether it's our oil oregano, super organic
[01:02:55.780 --> 01:02:57.500]  from the Mediterranean,
[01:02:57.500 --> 01:03:00.100]  ozonated olive oil for your face and body,
[01:03:00.100 --> 01:03:02.140]  oxy powder to flush out the liver cleanse.
[01:03:02.140 --> 01:03:03.740]  It's all back in stock right now.
[01:03:03.740 --> 01:03:07.420]  In FullWarsLife.com, in FullWarsStore.com

[01:03:11.340 --> 01:03:12.740]  a knockoff of the Trump stuff.

[01:03:14.220 --> 01:03:15.540]  That's an unprecedented 50% off
[01:03:15.540 --> 01:03:20.340]  on those Made in America hats, Make America Free Again.
[01:03:20.340 --> 01:03:23.500]  We no longer have a special for $9
[01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:25.180]  for the Hiller for Prison shirt.
[01:03:25.180 --> 01:03:26.180]  That's a limited edition.
[01:03:26.180 --> 01:03:27.020]  It's about to sell out.
[01:03:27.020 --> 01:03:29.980]  Well, the next edition, probably the final edition.
[01:03:29.980 --> 01:03:31.500]  So if you want to get those, they're $19.95.
[01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:32.660]  That supports the broadcast.
[01:03:32.660 --> 01:03:35.580]  But we are running a super male vitality special
[01:03:35.580 --> 01:03:40.580]  20% off at infowarslife.com.

[01:03:46.780 --> 01:03:48.580]  You can see the dramatic differences in my
[01:03:48.580 --> 01:03:49.620]  before and after photos.
[01:03:49.620 --> 01:03:51.300]  We probably put those on the website too.
[01:03:51.300 --> 01:03:53.260]  To help you get started with your transformation,
[01:03:53.260 --> 01:03:55.020]  we're giving you 20% off super male vitality

[01:03:56.700 --> 01:03:57.740]  I'll supplies last.
[01:03:57.740 --> 01:03:59.100]  Just read some of the five star reviews
[01:03:59.100 --> 01:04:01.180]  on infowarslife.com and see how listeners
[01:04:01.180 --> 01:04:03.700]  have transformed their bodies with super male vitality.
[01:04:03.700 --> 01:04:04.660]  I'll explain something.
[01:04:04.660 --> 01:04:09.220]  We take the safest known herbs and extracts
[01:04:09.220 --> 01:04:10.580]  that are known to supercharge
[01:04:10.580 --> 01:04:12.220]  and not mimic testosterone,
[01:04:12.220 --> 01:04:14.540]  but get your glands to release.
[01:04:14.540 --> 01:04:15.820]  No one really knows how it works.
[01:04:15.820 --> 01:04:17.580]  It's God's magic.
[01:04:17.580 --> 01:04:19.460]  But this is all just the cornucopia
[01:04:19.460 --> 01:04:20.780]  of the best stuff out there.
[01:04:20.780 --> 01:04:22.700]  I mean, everybody knows that this is a fill
[01:04:22.700 --> 01:04:24.420]  on the back at Listum.
[01:04:24.420 --> 01:04:27.020]  The herbs that are known for thousands of years
[01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:29.220]  be associated with fertility, strength, manhood,
[01:04:29.220 --> 01:04:30.060]  you name it.
[01:04:30.060 --> 01:04:31.260]  We have the female vitality as well.
[01:04:31.260 --> 01:04:32.660]  It's almost the same formula.
[01:04:32.660 --> 01:04:37.660]  But the point is, is that this is called press,
[01:04:37.740 --> 01:04:39.380]  into basically an oil.
[01:04:39.380 --> 01:04:41.180]  No one else does this.
[01:04:41.180 --> 01:04:44.620]  So it's got the essence, we go through hell.
[01:04:44.620 --> 01:04:47.100]  That's why it's sold out a lot because it's hard to source.
[01:04:47.100 --> 01:04:51.060]  And you get it where it's wet and it stays wet.
[01:04:51.060 --> 01:04:53.420]  It's not like we're dry, we make it wet.
[01:04:53.420 --> 01:04:54.460]  It's always wet.
[01:04:54.460 --> 01:04:55.820]  It's always fresh.
[01:04:55.820 --> 01:04:57.460]  And then put it into the bottle like wine.
[01:04:57.460 --> 01:04:58.780]  And then it's saved.
[01:04:58.780 --> 01:05:01.060]  And then it just gets better.
[01:05:01.060 --> 01:05:02.980]  In recently released emails of Colin Powell's
[01:05:02.980 --> 01:05:04.740]  correspondents with a Democrat donor,
[01:05:04.740 --> 01:05:07.660]  Powell gives the most succinct and accurate description ever
[01:05:07.660 --> 01:05:10.220]  of Hillary Clinton, saying she's a 70-year-old person
[01:05:10.220 --> 01:05:14.700]  with a long track record, unbridled ambition, greedy.
[01:05:14.700 --> 01:05:16.020]  But it gets even better.
[01:05:16.020 --> 01:05:18.340]  He said, I'd rather not have to vote for her,
[01:05:18.340 --> 01:05:20.860]  although she is a friend I respect.
[01:05:20.860 --> 01:05:22.020]  Respect?
[01:05:22.020 --> 01:05:25.260]  No, he'll vote for her because she's part of the club.
[01:05:25.260 --> 01:05:27.900]  Like the establishment elitists of Bohemian Grove,
[01:05:27.900 --> 01:05:29.820]  whom Powell said in another email,
[01:05:29.820 --> 01:05:31.740]  absolutely hate Trump.
[01:05:31.740 --> 01:05:33.300]  Most of those at Bohemian Grove, he said,
[01:05:33.300 --> 01:05:34.180]  will vote against him.
[01:05:34.180 --> 01:05:36.300]  But quite a few will not vote for Hillary
[01:05:36.300 --> 01:05:38.100]  and will vote for a third-party candidate.
[01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:40.140]  So while elitists gather in Bohemian Grove
[01:05:40.140 --> 01:05:42.140]  for, as the Washington Post describes it,
[01:05:42.140 --> 01:05:44.180]  heavy drinking, super-secret talks,
[01:05:44.180 --> 01:05:46.140]  druid worship, and other rituals.
[01:05:46.140 --> 01:05:49.340]  You know, like mock child sacrifices to Malik.
[01:05:49.340 --> 01:05:52.060]  Those people, the Satan-worshipping pedophiles,
[01:05:52.060 --> 01:05:53.620]  won't be voting for Trump.
[01:05:53.620 --> 01:05:56.820]  But they're just fine with Hillary and Gary Johnson.
[01:05:56.820 --> 01:06:00.900]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[01:06:00.900 --> 01:06:05.100]  Introducing Vitamin Mineral Fusion from InfowarsLife.com.
[01:06:05.100 --> 01:06:07.740]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists
[01:06:07.740 --> 01:06:10.700]  to create the most powerful and affordable, great-tasting
[01:06:10.700 --> 01:06:12.580]  multivitamin formula available.
[01:06:12.580 --> 01:06:15.220]  The all-new Vitamin Mineral Fusion drink mix
[01:06:15.220 --> 01:06:19.220]  at InfowarsLife.com is loaded with a full month supply
[01:06:19.220 --> 01:06:21.940]  of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids
[01:06:21.940 --> 01:06:23.980]  that your body absolutely needs.
[01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:25.900]  In the history of Infowars Life, we've
[01:06:25.900 --> 01:06:28.020]  brought out a lot of amazing products
[01:06:28.020 --> 01:06:30.820]  like Survival Shield X2, Super Metal Vitality,
[01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:31.860]  and so many others.
[01:06:31.860 --> 01:06:35.740]  But I am most proud of the product we're now launching today
[01:06:35.740 --> 01:06:38.860]  with its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing
[01:06:38.860 --> 01:06:41.500]  process designed for maximized effects.
[01:06:41.500 --> 01:06:43.900]  This formula is the platinum standard
[01:06:43.900 --> 01:06:45.940]  of multivitamin mineral products.
[01:06:45.940 --> 01:06:48.460]  The ingredients in Vitamin Mineral Fusion
[01:06:48.460 --> 01:06:52.260]  are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab
[01:06:52.260 --> 01:06:53.020]  standard.
[01:06:53.020 --> 01:06:54.420]  That means it's clean.
[01:06:54.420 --> 01:06:55.660]  That means it's pure.
[01:06:55.660 --> 01:06:58.540]  That's InfowarsLife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[01:06:58.540 --> 01:07:00.900]  Take action now before we sell out.
[01:07:00.900 --> 01:07:04.860]  Secret 12, Infowars Life's Vitamin B12 formulation.
[01:07:04.860 --> 01:07:08.980]  Most forms of Vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic
[01:07:08.980 --> 01:07:11.260]  and could not be properly absorbed by the body.
[01:07:11.260 --> 01:07:13.460]  That's why, for real results, so many
[01:07:13.460 --> 01:07:16.340]  are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which
[01:07:16.340 --> 01:07:18.500]  are known to have higher absorption rates.
[01:07:18.500 --> 01:07:21.180]  InfowarsLife.com is excited to announce
[01:07:21.180 --> 01:07:24.780]  that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12
[01:07:24.780 --> 01:07:27.580]  that has been developed with our exclusive perfective process.
[01:07:27.580 --> 01:07:31.020]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimentical grade,
[01:07:31.020 --> 01:07:33.820]  bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12,
[01:07:33.820 --> 01:07:36.780]  methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections,
[01:07:36.780 --> 01:07:38.580]  and adenosylcobalamin.
[01:07:38.580 --> 01:07:41.380]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue,
[01:07:41.380 --> 01:07:42.220]  and then swallowed.
[01:07:42.220 --> 01:07:44.140]  No needles, no injections.
[01:07:44.140 --> 01:07:45.740]  Don't take my word for it.
[01:07:45.740 --> 01:07:46.980]  Try it for yourself.
[01:07:46.980 --> 01:07:48.060]  Discover the secret.
[01:07:48.060 --> 01:07:49.180]  Secret 12.
[01:07:49.180 --> 01:07:52.500]  Secure your revolutionary Secret 12 formula right now
[01:07:52.500 --> 01:07:57.300]  at infowarslife.com, or call 888-253-3139.
[01:07:57.300 --> 01:07:59.180]  Infowars Life, Secret 12.
[01:07:59.180 --> 01:08:21.180]  We are on the march, the empire is on the run.
[01:08:21.180 --> 01:08:43.540]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[01:08:43.540 --> 01:08:45.060]  We are back live.
[01:08:45.060 --> 01:08:51.420]  Coming up, Tim Kennedy is going to give us the explosive first
[01:08:51.420 --> 01:08:54.900]  statement on the fight that Rashad Evans went ahead
[01:08:54.900 --> 01:08:59.300]  and announced yesterday, the day before he was supposed to.
[01:08:59.300 --> 01:09:01.540]  The next big middleweight fight, they said
[01:09:01.540 --> 01:09:04.860]  this would be one of the most anticipated fights ever.
[01:09:04.860 --> 01:09:06.460]  Obviously, it's in Madison Square Garden.
[01:09:06.460 --> 01:09:07.260]  The whole thing's crazy.
[01:09:07.260 --> 01:09:10.180]  First time in New York, where they've legalized it.
[01:09:10.180 --> 01:09:13.260]  And so this is going to be just something else.
[01:09:13.260 --> 01:09:16.820]  Tim Kennedy, by the way, works like 18 hours a day.
[01:09:16.820 --> 01:09:19.340]  And he's running around training police departments
[01:09:19.340 --> 01:09:25.700]  for free in counter sniper training
[01:09:25.700 --> 01:09:29.420]  and works out like three times a day
[01:09:29.420 --> 01:09:34.780]  and then goes and fight 30 black belts in a night.
[01:09:34.780 --> 01:09:36.100]  And my crew's actually gone with him.
[01:09:36.100 --> 01:09:37.380]  It's crazy.
[01:09:37.380 --> 01:09:38.900]  I think the guy trains too much.
[01:09:38.900 --> 01:09:41.220]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[01:09:41.220 --> 01:09:42.980]  Talk about a maniac.
[01:09:42.980 --> 01:09:45.260]  He is on another planet.
[01:09:45.260 --> 01:09:48.660]  So we're going to see what the Irishman can
[01:09:48.660 --> 01:09:54.940]  do with Mr. Evans, who's obviously very formidable.
[01:09:54.940 --> 01:09:56.900]  But he'll be here giving you the exclusive statement.
[01:09:56.900 --> 01:09:58.100]  I didn't even ask him to do this.
[01:09:58.100 --> 01:10:00.860]  I'm very honored that he wants to come on here and talk about it.
[01:10:00.860 --> 01:10:02.740]  And obviously, because the fighting is just
[01:10:02.740 --> 01:10:04.660]  like one small thing he does.
[01:10:04.660 --> 01:10:07.300]  His real passion is fighting the New World Order
[01:10:07.300 --> 01:10:11.380]  and training citizens and others on how
[01:10:11.380 --> 01:10:13.180]  to defend themselves.
[01:10:13.180 --> 01:10:18.300]  But there is a lot coming up today.
[01:10:18.300 --> 01:10:20.260]  But he's in fight camp.
[01:10:20.260 --> 01:10:21.580]  He's driving over here right now.
[01:10:21.580 --> 01:10:22.580]  He's going to eat something.
[01:10:22.580 --> 01:10:24.380]  I said, look, you don't have to come around at 1230.
[01:10:24.380 --> 01:10:25.740]  You can eat something.
[01:10:25.740 --> 01:10:28.980]  And then we're going to have him on here to talk about this.
[01:10:28.980 --> 01:10:31.740]  So that's coming up today.
[01:10:31.740 --> 01:10:36.700]  Now, before I go any further, I want to go to your phone calls.
[01:10:36.700 --> 01:10:37.580]  I've got a lot of clips.
[01:10:37.580 --> 01:10:40.620]  I already played Congress subpoenaing the FBI,
[01:10:40.620 --> 01:10:44.100]  live on TV saying you will give us your real field reports
[01:10:44.100 --> 01:10:46.260]  with Hillary Clinton, not the redacted ones.
[01:10:46.260 --> 01:10:48.580]  We are the purse strings.
[01:10:48.580 --> 01:10:50.700]  We are the main check and balance on you.
[01:10:50.700 --> 01:10:51.980]  Do you understand?
[01:10:51.980 --> 01:10:53.420]  And the FBI tried to say, no, we
[01:10:53.420 --> 01:10:55.820]  can give you what we want, do a Freedom Information Act
[01:10:55.820 --> 01:10:56.620]  request.
[01:10:56.620 --> 01:11:01.580]  And this is the judicial committee that is over it.
[01:11:01.580 --> 01:11:03.900]  Actually funds the FBI, basically.
[01:11:03.900 --> 01:11:05.820]  He's like, are you kidding me?
[01:11:05.820 --> 01:11:08.300]  It's like having your 10-year-old kid.
[01:11:08.300 --> 01:11:10.260]  You come home and you go, hey, get your feet off
[01:11:10.260 --> 01:11:13.780]  the table and pick up that cereal dumped all over the counter.
[01:11:13.780 --> 01:11:15.260]  And what are your muddy shoes?
[01:11:15.260 --> 01:11:17.340]  And your 10-year-old looks at you and goes,
[01:11:17.340 --> 01:11:18.900]  you know what, I run the show now.
[01:11:18.900 --> 01:11:20.860]  And you're like, OK, well, you don't actually
[01:11:20.860 --> 01:11:22.740]  run the show now.
[01:11:22.740 --> 01:11:26.300]  What planet are you on?
[01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:27.700]  But that's what globalism is.
[01:11:27.700 --> 01:11:31.660]  It's an exercise of dragging us through the mud, training us,
[01:11:31.660 --> 01:11:33.980]  that the servant is the master.
[01:11:33.980 --> 01:11:35.900]  And that's not how to calculate the cabbage.
[01:11:35.900 --> 01:11:38.420]  I want to go to your phone calls, John and Junior and Haiti
[01:11:38.420 --> 01:11:41.860]  and Daniel and Sebastian and others.
[01:11:41.860 --> 01:11:47.380]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-25-99-231.
[01:11:47.380 --> 01:11:49.060]  Now, I said Nicholas R. Cozzi's bad.
[01:11:49.060 --> 01:11:50.420]  He's a globalist.
[01:11:50.420 --> 01:11:51.740]  But nothing compared to Hollande.
[01:11:51.740 --> 01:11:53.860]  So notice as soon as he announces he's running for president
[01:11:53.860 --> 01:11:55.540]  again in France, they've indicted him.
[01:11:55.540 --> 01:12:00.020]  And now he says he's questioning global warming
[01:12:00.020 --> 01:12:01.540]  and saying it's a plan to basically shut down
[01:12:01.540 --> 01:12:02.460]  industrial societies.
[01:12:02.460 --> 01:12:03.620]  Yes, that's what it is.
[01:12:03.620 --> 01:12:05.340]  But don't worry, bizarro world.
[01:12:05.340 --> 01:12:08.140]  Hillary says she's been more transparent.
[01:12:08.140 --> 01:12:09.940]  That's a quote, I'm going to play this clip later,
[01:12:09.940 --> 01:12:13.860]  than any president, any presidential candidate ever.
[01:12:13.860 --> 01:12:17.540]  And even Lemon on CNN, Don Lemon,
[01:12:17.540 --> 01:12:20.060]  laughed when she said this.
[01:12:20.060 --> 01:12:20.700]  We'll play it later.
[01:12:20.700 --> 01:12:23.300]  It's up on m4s.com because it's just ridiculous.
[01:12:23.300 --> 01:12:24.580]  No one's been more secretive.
[01:12:24.580 --> 01:12:26.540]  Now they have the Clinton Foundation coming out.
[01:12:26.540 --> 01:12:29.340]  We have video of this, too, saying
[01:12:29.340 --> 01:12:31.140]  they are completely transparent.
[01:12:31.140 --> 01:12:33.460]  They use classic money laundering strategies
[01:12:33.460 --> 01:12:34.700]  that if anybody else was doing it,
[01:12:34.700 --> 01:12:37.380]  you'd be instantly investigated.
[01:12:37.380 --> 01:12:38.620]  You'd be indicted.
[01:12:38.620 --> 01:12:40.860]  In fact, these practices are illegal.
[01:12:40.860 --> 01:12:43.740]  They use shell corporations, dummy accounts,
[01:12:43.740 --> 01:12:46.940]  foreign accounts, it's all secret.
[01:12:46.940 --> 01:12:47.820]  And we have the emails.
[01:12:47.820 --> 01:12:51.460]  It's like, yeah, you give me a million dollars
[01:12:51.460 --> 01:12:53.460]  and I'll get you access to the Chinese president.
[01:12:53.460 --> 01:12:54.820]  Wow.
[01:12:54.820 --> 01:12:57.420]  By the way, London Guardian, the observer,
[01:12:57.420 --> 01:12:58.340]  is reporting this.
[01:13:01.180 --> 01:13:05.180]  Goose for 2.0, Obama sold off public offices to donors.
[01:13:05.180 --> 01:13:07.100]  And listen, this has gone on for a while.
[01:13:07.100 --> 01:13:09.580]  But they're so brazen, it's like, yeah,
[01:13:09.580 --> 01:13:11.140]  give us half a million, give us a million,
[01:13:11.140 --> 01:13:15.500]  give us 2 million, you got the ambassadorship.
[01:13:15.500 --> 01:13:17.860]  That's a palace, your own guards, you name it.
[01:13:17.860 --> 01:13:19.660]  And all the contacts you can make in that country
[01:13:19.660 --> 01:13:22.780]  to make special money and sell your own influence
[01:13:22.780 --> 01:13:25.780]  for a million bucks or it went for different prices.
[01:13:25.780 --> 01:13:28.580]  Totally illegal.
[01:13:28.580 --> 01:13:33.140]  110% flaming crime.
[01:13:33.140 --> 01:13:34.260]  And we have Obama on that.
[01:13:34.260 --> 01:13:38.620]  Maybe he'll just pardon himself.
[01:13:38.620 --> 01:13:39.980]  Meanwhile, I've got to play this clip
[01:13:39.980 --> 01:13:40.820]  that I'm going to go to your calls.
[01:13:40.820 --> 01:13:41.900]  I'm going to play some Trump clips here,
[01:13:41.900 --> 01:13:43.540]  because I never get to these clips, and these are gold.
[01:13:43.540 --> 01:13:45.060]  Then I'm going to take your calls.
[01:13:45.060 --> 01:13:47.540]  We've got Trump talking about the fact
[01:13:47.540 --> 01:13:54.660]  that Hillary could not sit there and speak in a room
[01:13:54.660 --> 01:13:57.580]  with 10,000 people, it's supposed to hold 5,000,
[01:13:57.580 --> 01:14:00.060]  and the temperature is like 115, 120.
[01:14:00.060 --> 01:14:02.220]  Hillary couldn't even stand there for an hour and it was 70
[01:14:02.220 --> 01:14:05.020]  degrees, but Trump makes the point that she couldn't even
[01:14:05.020 --> 01:14:05.980]  stand there.
[01:14:05.980 --> 01:14:08.100]  And Hillary's nowhere to be seen.
[01:14:08.100 --> 01:14:10.940]  She does phone interviews now, but everything's fine.
[01:14:10.940 --> 01:14:12.900]  It'd be like saying Lennon is still alive,
[01:14:12.900 --> 01:14:15.420]  even though his body is embalmed on Red Square.
[01:14:15.420 --> 01:14:17.340]  Maybe we can have an embalmed body.
[01:14:17.340 --> 01:14:18.980]  Matt Drudge has a brain and a jar.
[01:14:18.980 --> 01:14:20.660]  Forget even a brain and a jar.
[01:14:20.660 --> 01:14:22.740]  She's just have a dead body embalmed.
[01:14:26.020 --> 01:14:27.460]  Let's play Trump.
[01:14:27.460 --> 01:14:35.100]  It is hot, and it's always hot when I perform,
[01:14:35.100 --> 01:14:36.620]  because the crowds are so big.
[01:14:36.620 --> 01:14:39.620]  These rooms were not designed for this kind of a crowd.
[01:14:39.620 --> 01:14:40.780]  I don't know, folks.
[01:14:40.780 --> 01:14:43.660]  You think Hillary would be able to stand up here for an hour
[01:14:43.660 --> 01:14:44.500]  and do this?
[01:14:44.500 --> 01:14:45.980]  I don't know.
[01:14:48.380 --> 01:14:49.020]  There you go.
[01:14:49.020 --> 01:14:50.460]  A few other clips I want to get to.
[01:14:50.460 --> 01:14:52.620]  Since I mentioned it, let's do Don Lemon laughs
[01:14:52.620 --> 01:14:55.580]  at Hillary's claims of transparency.
[01:14:55.580 --> 01:15:00.860]  And then we've got another clip here with CNN doctor,
[01:15:00.860 --> 01:15:04.300]  Sanjay Gupta, saying we still don't know a lot of things
[01:15:04.300 --> 01:15:05.820]  about Hillary's health, and saying
[01:15:05.820 --> 01:15:07.460]  this is not a release of medical records.
[01:15:07.460 --> 01:15:12.820]  This is her doctor saying she's completely normal.
[01:15:12.820 --> 01:15:14.100]  Now, you know what that means.
[01:15:14.100 --> 01:15:15.580]  Somebody don't want to lose their medical license down
[01:15:15.580 --> 01:15:15.980]  the rugs.
[01:15:15.980 --> 01:15:18.620]  They know the rats are leaving the sinking ship.
[01:15:18.620 --> 01:15:20.180]  See, the confidence is being lost right now.
[01:15:20.180 --> 01:15:22.020]  So Lemon, his little backstabber, so he
[01:15:22.020 --> 01:15:22.980]  can't help but laugh at her.
[01:15:22.980 --> 01:15:25.780]  And her own doctor says, oh, she's completely normal.
[01:15:25.780 --> 01:15:28.100]  Well, if you've already got cancer of the brain and the lungs,
[01:15:28.100 --> 01:15:30.500]  you've already have seizures every 15, 20 minutes.
[01:15:30.500 --> 01:15:32.820]  And you're totally bombed out of your brain on drugs most
[01:15:32.820 --> 01:15:34.020]  of the time, because if you don't,
[01:15:34.020 --> 01:15:35.860]  you'll have seizures every five minutes.
[01:15:35.860 --> 01:15:37.540]  And yeah, that's normal.
[01:15:37.540 --> 01:15:40.580]  That's the new normal of being an invalid.
[01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:48.740]  But first, let's get to Don Lemon laughs at Hillary's claims.
[01:15:48.740 --> 01:15:51.420]  I'm not going to comment on anything
[01:15:51.420 --> 01:15:53.660]  that is said in a private email.
[01:15:53.660 --> 01:15:57.300]  And even to critics beyond the former secretary?
[01:15:57.300 --> 01:16:00.540]  I think I've worked very, very hard
[01:16:00.540 --> 01:16:06.100]  to be more transparent than not just my opponent,
[01:16:06.100 --> 01:16:11.980]  but really in a comparison to anybody who's run.
[01:16:11.980 --> 01:16:14.380]  The medical information I've put out,
[01:16:14.380 --> 01:16:17.140]  and we're going to put out more, needs
[01:16:17.140 --> 01:16:21.500]  than exceeds the standards that other presidential candidates,
[01:16:21.500 --> 01:16:24.620]  including President Obama and Mitt Romney and others,
[01:16:24.620 --> 01:16:25.980]  have met.
[01:16:25.980 --> 01:16:27.620]  My tax returns are out there.
[01:16:27.620 --> 01:16:31.260]  40 years of transparency about my tax returns.
[01:16:31.260 --> 01:16:32.060]  That's enough.
[01:16:32.060 --> 01:16:33.100]  So I think.
[01:16:33.100 --> 01:16:34.300]  Please turn it off.
[01:16:34.300 --> 01:16:36.020]  She can't even do TV interviews now,
[01:16:36.020 --> 01:16:41.260]  because she's just somewhere secretively having convulsions.
[01:16:41.260 --> 01:16:44.460]  Yeah, her tax returns are done by big organized crime law
[01:16:44.460 --> 01:16:48.180]  firms that are run by former attorney generals and people.
[01:16:48.180 --> 01:16:50.020]  So you go there, because no one's
[01:16:50.020 --> 01:16:51.340]  going to indict the former attorney general.
[01:16:51.340 --> 01:16:53.100]  They certify your fake tax returns
[01:16:53.100 --> 01:16:55.220]  when you've got all these offshore accounts and secret
[01:16:55.220 --> 01:16:57.100]  accounts that they admit are totally criminal.
[01:16:57.100 --> 01:16:59.180]  So yes, we've got your fake tax returns.
[01:16:59.180 --> 01:17:02.020]  You know, good for Trump not releasing his.
[01:17:02.020 --> 01:17:03.340]  But if I was Trump, he always says,
[01:17:03.340 --> 01:17:05.500]  well, I'll release my tax returns
[01:17:05.500 --> 01:17:07.540]  if she releases her medical stuff.
[01:17:07.540 --> 01:17:09.100]  See, Washington to be a one-way street.
[01:17:09.100 --> 01:17:09.660]  I agree with Trump.
[01:17:09.660 --> 01:17:12.620]  That's good negotiation, but that's not even
[01:17:12.620 --> 01:17:15.780]  what we're talking about here.
[01:17:15.780 --> 01:17:17.540]  Hillary Clinton used to say, needs
[01:17:17.540 --> 01:17:20.860]  to release her foundation documents
[01:17:20.860 --> 01:17:24.380]  from all of her Swiss bank accounts and Canadian bank
[01:17:24.380 --> 01:17:27.060]  accounts and Luxembourg bank accounts
[01:17:27.060 --> 01:17:30.620]  and Grand Cayman and Bahama bank accounts
[01:17:30.620 --> 01:17:34.300]  and Panamanian bank accounts, sweetheart.
[01:17:34.300 --> 01:17:35.340]  We want to see that.
[01:17:35.340 --> 01:17:37.380]  You want my tax returns when you've
[01:17:37.380 --> 01:17:41.260]  got a bunch of shady accounts, lady?
[01:17:41.260 --> 01:17:43.260]  In fact, shady is not even the right word.
[01:17:43.260 --> 01:17:45.180]  Here is the Clinton Foundation president.
[01:17:45.180 --> 01:17:47.700]  Donna Shalala says the Clinton Foundation
[01:17:47.700 --> 01:17:49.060]  is the most transparent foundation
[01:17:49.060 --> 01:17:53.100]  in the history of the world.
[01:17:53.100 --> 01:17:54.660]  Of course, it's totally secret.
[01:17:54.660 --> 01:17:56.580]  Of all the experts say it's completely criminal.
[01:17:56.580 --> 01:17:57.940]  Nothing's ever been seen like this.
[01:17:57.940 --> 01:18:01.180]  It's the most brazen gang raping, but it doesn't matter.
[01:18:01.180 --> 01:18:03.260]  Here's Donna Shalala.
[01:18:03.260 --> 01:18:06.140]  The Clinton Foundation is totally transparent.
[01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:07.700]  You can see our tax returns.
[01:18:07.700 --> 01:18:09.540]  You can see who our donors are.
[01:18:09.540 --> 01:18:11.220]  We reveal our donors quarterly.
[01:18:11.220 --> 01:18:12.940]  You can't find a charity in this world
[01:18:12.940 --> 01:18:15.340]  that reveals their donors quarterly.
[01:18:19.660 --> 01:18:21.900]  Who the donors are, you claim, but not the money
[01:18:21.900 --> 01:18:25.260]  or where it went or where it was paid?
[01:18:25.260 --> 01:18:28.300]  Donors get the money in, and then you don't tell folks,
[01:18:28.300 --> 01:18:31.020]  but we have the emails, what they're getting for the money.
[01:18:31.020 --> 01:18:33.620]  State Department access, White House access,
[01:18:33.620 --> 01:18:34.860]  access to the Chinese president.
[01:18:34.860 --> 01:18:36.940]  Again, when that came out two weeks ago in the latest emails,
[01:18:36.940 --> 01:18:38.660]  I was like, I never thought of that.
[01:18:38.660 --> 01:18:43.660]  She's such an independent that like,
[01:18:43.900 --> 01:18:45.140]  she plays offense and defense.
[01:18:45.140 --> 01:18:49.300]  Let's say 49ers versus the Pittsburgh Steelers.
[01:18:50.580 --> 01:18:53.100]  And she plays offense for the Steelers
[01:18:53.100 --> 01:18:54.620]  and defense for the 49ers.
[01:18:54.620 --> 01:18:56.180]  And then she never leaves the field.
[01:18:56.180 --> 01:18:58.620]  She just, she puts on a uniform during the breaks
[01:18:58.620 --> 01:19:00.260]  and just goes on different sides of the field
[01:19:00.260 --> 01:19:01.740]  and she plays both sides.
[01:19:01.740 --> 01:19:03.500]  I mean, I know we know they play both sides,
[01:19:03.500 --> 01:19:08.500]  but man, she represents the Communist president against
[01:19:09.980 --> 01:19:13.260]  US interests, arrest her immediately.
[01:19:13.260 --> 01:19:15.020]  Let's skip this break.
[01:19:15.020 --> 01:19:18.300]  This is the world we now live in, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:19:18.300 --> 01:19:20.420]  This is the world we now witness.
[01:19:20.420 --> 01:19:22.260]  This is the world we're now in.
[01:19:24.580 --> 01:19:28.420]  We're these con men and con women like Donna Shalala
[01:19:28.420 --> 01:19:33.420]  and Madeline Albright sit up there
[01:19:39.580 --> 01:19:42.380]  and just spew disinformation arrogantly at people.
[01:19:43.460 --> 01:19:44.660]  All right, I'm gonna go to your phone calls,
[01:19:44.660 --> 01:19:45.780]  but since I mentioned it,
[01:19:45.780 --> 01:19:48.500]  let's just, let's just get one more of these clips in.
[01:19:48.500 --> 01:19:50.300]  Which one of the Goopter clips is the best?
[01:19:50.300 --> 01:19:52.780]  Is this is not a release of medical records?
[01:19:52.780 --> 01:19:54.380]  Goopter, we still do not know a lot of things.
[01:19:54.380 --> 01:19:55.220]  You know what?
[01:19:55.220 --> 01:19:56.060]  We know Hillary's super ill.
[01:19:56.060 --> 01:19:56.900]  We don't even need to play this.
[01:19:56.900 --> 01:20:00.980]  I mean, that dog's already caught the pheasant.
[01:20:02.180 --> 01:20:04.900]  That ship already left the harbor.
[01:20:04.900 --> 01:20:05.940]  Train already left the station.
[01:20:05.940 --> 01:20:07.140]  Junie out of the bottle.
[01:20:09.940 --> 01:20:11.220]  But you know what?
[01:20:11.220 --> 01:20:12.780]  We shouldn't get target blind here
[01:20:12.780 --> 01:20:15.020]  because we already know we're right,
[01:20:15.020 --> 01:20:17.060]  but some of the public still,
[01:20:17.060 --> 01:20:19.700]  you know what one clip I wanna play is Bill Clinton.
[01:20:19.700 --> 01:20:24.700]  Bill Clinton jokes about Hillary's secret server scandal.
[01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:26.220]  And there's another one here
[01:20:26.220 --> 01:20:29.460]  where Bill Clinton jokes about Hillary's health.
[01:20:30.780 --> 01:20:34.580]  And then says that she had the flu now, not pneumonia.
[01:20:34.580 --> 01:20:36.860]  First it was the exhaustion, then pneumonia, not the flu.
[01:20:36.860 --> 01:20:38.940]  And her doctor, once folks pointed out
[01:20:38.940 --> 01:20:41.020]  that she went and hugged the kid and said,
[01:20:41.020 --> 01:20:42.460]  oh, you had pneumonia.
[01:20:42.460 --> 01:20:43.540]  We all know you didn't have pneumonia.
[01:20:43.540 --> 01:20:44.740]  Later you're having epilepsy.
[01:20:44.740 --> 01:20:45.580]  You got a brain tumor.
[01:20:45.580 --> 01:20:46.420]  We understand.
[01:20:46.420 --> 01:20:47.260]  We're sorry for you.
[01:20:47.260 --> 01:20:48.100]  As bad as you are.
[01:20:48.100 --> 01:20:49.940]  I mean, see, getting ready to be Lucifer
[01:20:49.940 --> 01:20:51.380]  and the grim reaper are like right there.
[01:20:51.380 --> 01:20:53.100]  And we're like, ooh.
[01:20:53.100 --> 01:20:54.300]  It's like, you know, under the skin
[01:20:54.300 --> 01:20:56.180]  or something about to watch you get sucked dry
[01:20:56.180 --> 01:20:58.420]  in another dimension, a big old spider coming in
[01:20:58.420 --> 01:21:00.340]  to have a meal, I still feel sorry for you
[01:21:00.340 --> 01:21:01.940]  because you look like a human.
[01:21:01.940 --> 01:21:03.540]  So I have that empathy.
[01:21:03.540 --> 01:21:04.820]  Sweetie, I do.
[01:21:04.820 --> 01:21:09.460]  I mean, my heart's so red and pink and full of love.
[01:21:09.460 --> 01:21:11.660]  I don't like watching what's happened to you.
[01:21:12.740 --> 01:21:14.700]  But you've got your zombie husband.
[01:21:14.700 --> 01:21:17.340]  Oh, I can hardly stay awake when he's on TV.
[01:21:17.340 --> 01:21:21.540]  Oh, Hillary's, Hillary has faints all the time.
[01:21:21.540 --> 01:21:23.220]  I mean, she never faints.
[01:21:23.220 --> 01:21:27.180]  I mean, I mean, we've got all this craziness going on.
[01:21:27.180 --> 01:21:29.580]  This guy looks like he's about to die any minute.
[01:21:31.020 --> 01:21:32.460]  That's what evil does to you, folks.
[01:21:32.460 --> 01:21:33.860]  Take a good long look at it.
[01:21:35.060 --> 01:21:37.660]  You got to serve somebody, don't you?
[01:21:37.660 --> 01:21:40.380]  I don't think he's serving somebody too good.
[01:21:40.380 --> 01:21:43.220]  His old Diablo always gets you in the end.
[01:21:45.820 --> 01:21:48.100]  And Faust could have left anytime he wanted to,
[01:21:48.100 --> 01:21:52.220]  but he just couldn't believe he was conned by the devil.
[01:21:52.220 --> 01:21:54.500]  And you can't cheat an honest man,
[01:21:56.220 --> 01:21:57.700]  but you can cheat Bill Clinton.
[01:21:58.660 --> 01:21:59.780]  Because he's so smart,
[01:21:59.780 --> 01:22:01.540]  he thinks he's got every angle covered.
[01:22:01.540 --> 01:22:03.820]  He's got everything down.
[01:22:03.820 --> 01:22:06.740]  It must feel really good to be a guy like that.
[01:22:08.980 --> 01:22:12.340]  Somebody who thinks he's bulletproof and immortal,
[01:22:12.340 --> 01:22:14.100]  he can get up there on TV and tell you
[01:22:14.100 --> 01:22:17.820]  that my wife, hell, she can walk both ways to school,
[01:22:17.820 --> 01:22:22.020]  uphill in snow, 20 miles through the Rocky Mountains.
[01:22:22.020 --> 01:22:23.580]  I mean, I've got to see it in clips.
[01:22:23.580 --> 01:22:24.420]  I can play for her.
[01:22:24.420 --> 01:22:25.260]  There you go.
[01:22:25.260 --> 01:22:26.780]  This woman's got stamina, none of us are gone.
[01:22:26.780 --> 01:22:28.100]  Okay.
[01:22:28.100 --> 01:22:29.420]  Hold on, excuse me.
[01:22:29.420 --> 01:22:32.460]  Let me just tell you, this lady is incredible.
[01:22:33.460 --> 01:22:36.740]  We bought my bottom lip.
[01:22:36.740 --> 01:22:38.740]  I like to buy women a lip or rape them.
[01:22:39.940 --> 01:22:43.260]  But what about all you people that went along with this?
[01:22:43.260 --> 01:22:45.260]  I mean, how are you feeling right now?
[01:22:46.940 --> 01:22:49.260]  We have this Bohemian Grove article up on enforce.com.
[01:22:49.260 --> 01:22:53.820]  The latest hacked emails from Bohemian Grove,
[01:22:53.820 --> 01:22:56.340]  which is like the Democrat takeover
[01:22:56.340 --> 01:22:59.740]  of the Republican Party base,
[01:22:59.740 --> 01:23:01.460]  where they think they can get the Republicans in
[01:23:01.460 --> 01:23:03.060]  and they can get them to have some gay sex
[01:23:03.060 --> 01:23:03.900]  and get it on video
[01:23:03.900 --> 01:23:05.620]  that they can then blackmail the Republican Party.
[01:23:05.620 --> 01:23:07.420]  And what it is is a blackmailing facility,
[01:23:07.420 --> 01:23:09.340]  I guess is my opinion on that,
[01:23:09.340 --> 01:23:10.380]  is a proper name for it.
[01:23:10.380 --> 01:23:14.340]  But Powell, email Bohemian Grove attendees
[01:23:14.340 --> 01:23:15.700]  will vote against Trump.
[01:23:15.700 --> 01:23:16.620]  Yes, of course they will.
[01:23:16.620 --> 01:23:19.780]  I mean, more evidence that Trump is an outsider.
[01:23:19.780 --> 01:23:21.620]  And then they say, oh, he'll wreck the country.
[01:23:21.620 --> 01:23:23.900]  Oh, like you've done by design
[01:23:23.900 --> 01:23:26.300]  to parlay it into your global government.
[01:23:26.300 --> 01:23:27.700]  And now you're all screwing each other
[01:23:27.700 --> 01:23:29.100]  and China's doubling back.
[01:23:29.100 --> 01:23:31.300]  And you're not actually industrializing the third world
[01:23:31.300 --> 01:23:32.900]  like you said you would.
[01:23:32.900 --> 01:23:34.380]  And then we get the UN documents
[01:23:34.380 --> 01:23:36.660]  and you actually plan to bankrupt the third world even more.
[01:23:36.660 --> 01:23:38.260]  You people are pigs.
[01:23:40.260 --> 01:23:42.340]  It isn't lost on Obama when he's there
[01:23:42.340 --> 01:23:44.140]  with a red carpet and Air Force One
[01:23:44.140 --> 01:23:45.900]  and six other airplanes behind him
[01:23:45.900 --> 01:23:47.340]  and hundreds of secret service
[01:23:47.340 --> 01:23:49.860]  to South African college students.
[01:23:50.820 --> 01:23:52.740]  Not you can innovate and have clean technology
[01:23:52.740 --> 01:23:54.940]  and blah, blah, blah, no, no.
[01:23:54.940 --> 01:23:57.180]  Listen, you can't have cars or air conditioning.
[01:23:57.180 --> 01:23:59.060]  All right, now I gotta get back on this jumbo jet.
[01:23:59.060 --> 01:23:59.900]  See you later.
[01:24:01.380 --> 01:24:03.300]  Because I'm Obama, I'm black, I'm liberal.
[01:24:03.300 --> 01:24:05.260]  You can't have jack crap.
[01:24:05.260 --> 01:24:06.100]  But I had everything.
[01:24:06.100 --> 01:24:07.300]  All right, see you later.
[01:24:09.820 --> 01:24:12.940]  Because the planet will boil over, was a full quote.
[01:24:12.940 --> 01:24:14.100]  And you look at that and you go,
[01:24:14.100 --> 01:24:16.020]  man, the disconnect,
[01:24:16.020 --> 01:24:21.060]  Africa's got some really cool, beautiful country,
[01:24:21.060 --> 01:24:22.500]  great people on average,
[01:24:22.500 --> 01:24:24.220]  but just never got out of slavery,
[01:24:24.220 --> 01:24:27.020]  never got out of tyranny, never got out of colonialism.
[01:24:27.020 --> 01:24:29.500]  And then you've got Obama perched on top of it,
[01:24:29.500 --> 01:24:32.340]  saying you can't have industrialization.
[01:24:32.340 --> 01:24:35.940]  And it's like, oh, thank you, black father.
[01:24:37.740 --> 01:24:41.500]  I mean, he's the devil with a brown face
[01:24:41.500 --> 01:24:44.060]  sent to screw you.
[01:24:47.660 --> 01:24:48.980]  Okay, I said I'd go to your phone calls,
[01:24:48.980 --> 01:24:50.940]  some Kennedy's coming up, so many other clubs to get to,
[01:24:50.940 --> 01:24:52.660]  but since I mentioned it, here's Bill Clinton.
[01:24:52.660 --> 01:24:54.420]  Here's the, I mean, I don't just say,
[01:24:54.420 --> 01:24:56.380]  he looks like a reanimated corpse to be mean.
[01:24:56.380 --> 01:24:59.500]  He looks like, he could star,
[01:24:59.500 --> 01:25:01.980]  if I was a Hollywood director that made zombie movies,
[01:25:01.980 --> 01:25:03.580]  I would just go with the average dumb zombies.
[01:25:03.580 --> 01:25:04.940]  I kind of have like interesting looking zombies.
[01:25:04.940 --> 01:25:07.460]  Like, what if zombies had high IQs
[01:25:07.460 --> 01:25:10.500]  and were just kind of like vampires and live for it?
[01:25:10.500 --> 01:25:11.780]  As long as they could rape a woman a day
[01:25:11.780 --> 01:25:13.380]  and you know, snort cocaine or whatever.
[01:25:13.380 --> 01:25:14.420]  That would be Bill Clinton.
[01:25:14.420 --> 01:25:15.980]  He's kind of like your smart zombie.
[01:25:15.980 --> 01:25:17.180]  He nods off in things.
[01:25:17.180 --> 01:25:22.180]  He's got some problems, but it's the end of the line.
[01:25:22.700 --> 01:25:24.780]  Because you can run on for a long time.
[01:25:24.780 --> 01:25:26.580]  You can run on for a long time.
[01:25:26.580 --> 01:25:28.980]  Sooner or later, God's gonna cut you down.
[01:25:28.980 --> 01:25:30.580]  And God's gonna cut me down too.
[01:25:33.260 --> 01:25:35.860]  But the closer I get to God, the less I fear death.
[01:25:35.860 --> 01:25:40.580]  Those of you that serve evil, though,
[01:25:40.580 --> 01:25:43.060]  I know get really concerned, don't you?
[01:25:43.060 --> 01:25:45.540]  They go, they're so scared of death.
[01:25:45.540 --> 01:25:50.540]  You're so scared of the angel of death.
[01:25:51.380 --> 01:25:52.820]  The angel of death is real.
[01:25:55.820 --> 01:25:57.020]  And I don't wanna die.
[01:25:58.100 --> 01:26:00.020]  I wanna live to be 150.
[01:26:00.020 --> 01:26:00.860]  I enjoy my life.
[01:26:00.860 --> 01:26:01.860]  I wanna be here to take care of my family.
[01:26:01.860 --> 01:26:06.060]  But angel of death shows up for me.
[01:26:06.060 --> 01:26:07.060]  I'm not a haughty person.
[01:26:07.060 --> 01:26:09.420]  I'm not a person full of can't.
[01:26:09.420 --> 01:26:10.940]  And I don't think I've got all the answers,
[01:26:10.940 --> 01:26:11.980]  but I know I love God.
[01:26:15.580 --> 01:26:16.700]  See, I'm beyond these people.
[01:26:16.700 --> 01:26:17.540]  And so are you.
[01:26:17.540 --> 01:26:18.860]  I'm beyond the angel of death now.
[01:26:18.860 --> 01:26:19.860]  I'm already with God.
[01:26:21.300 --> 01:26:22.380]  And thank God I am.
[01:26:24.220 --> 01:26:25.620]  That's why I look at Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton.
[01:26:25.620 --> 01:26:26.580]  I really feel sorry for them,
[01:26:26.580 --> 01:26:28.180]  despite all the bad things they've done.
[01:26:28.180 --> 01:26:29.340]  They're humans we lost.
[01:26:29.340 --> 01:26:30.700]  They're people we lost to evil.
[01:26:30.700 --> 01:26:34.500]  To this galactic scourge, this dimensional infestation.
[01:26:35.900 --> 01:26:38.580]  But once in science is proving it,
[01:26:38.580 --> 01:26:41.260]  once we can absolutely have a clear understanding of this,
[01:26:41.260 --> 01:26:43.140]  even in this dimension,
[01:26:43.140 --> 01:26:44.660]  we're gonna have such a better time of this,
[01:26:44.660 --> 01:26:46.740]  understanding how to stop these infections
[01:26:46.740 --> 01:26:49.380]  and not act like this and not behave like this
[01:26:49.380 --> 01:26:50.580]  and go to the next level.
[01:26:52.500 --> 01:26:56.460]  Okay, I want to continue here with Bill Clinton.
[01:26:56.460 --> 01:26:57.820]  I mentioned it here at us.
[01:26:57.820 --> 01:27:02.820]  Now we know, after all the hullabaloo over this email deal,
[01:27:05.300 --> 01:27:07.740]  you know, it was for a year we were told
[01:27:07.740 --> 01:27:10.580]  this is the biggest problem since the end of World War II.
[01:27:10.580 --> 01:27:13.580]  That's pretty damn bad, fine, I'm just gonna say it.
[01:27:15.580 --> 01:27:18.100]  Finally, the Washington Post, their everlasting credit say,
[01:27:18.100 --> 01:27:20.180]  I think we've had about enough of this.
[01:27:20.180 --> 01:27:23.180]  Oh, the Washington Post said, we had about enough of this.
[01:27:23.180 --> 01:27:25.180]  The official, the Washington Post said,
[01:27:25.180 --> 01:27:28.140]  we had about enough of this, the official,
[01:27:28.140 --> 01:27:30.380]  and I say official, it's rum of the Democrats.
[01:27:31.380 --> 01:27:34.820]  Washington Post, it said it was over.
[01:27:35.820 --> 01:27:37.460]  Just like the week before Hillary collapsed,
[01:27:37.460 --> 01:27:39.180]  they said, Alex Jones is discredited,
[01:27:39.180 --> 01:27:41.220]  Hillary Clinton has wonderful health.
[01:27:41.220 --> 01:27:42.300]  She falls right over.
[01:27:45.540 --> 01:27:49.060]  He just walks around there calling these people who he hates
[01:27:50.220 --> 01:27:52.020]  because Bill Clinton is ugly.
[01:27:52.020 --> 01:27:53.860]  Bill Clinton is degenerate.
[01:27:53.860 --> 01:27:55.780]  Bill Clinton, and he doesn't like being out there
[01:27:55.780 --> 01:27:56.780]  with just a bunch of regular people,
[01:27:56.780 --> 01:27:59.260]  whereas I like being around regular honest folks.
[01:27:59.260 --> 01:28:00.660]  See, Bill Clinton doesn't like it.
[01:28:00.660 --> 01:28:02.980]  He's up there just, he's got him sucked in,
[01:28:02.980 --> 01:28:06.420]  he's got him roped in, he's got him right where he wants him.
[01:28:06.420 --> 01:28:09.220]  He just is a lather in the BS on him, here he is.
[01:28:11.100 --> 01:28:12.620]  We know that what Hillary said
[01:28:12.620 --> 01:28:15.540]  about talking to Secretary Powell about it was true.
[01:28:15.540 --> 01:28:16.700]  Finally, can you believe it?
[01:28:16.700 --> 01:28:19.780]  They waited so long, they've released that email.
[01:28:19.780 --> 01:28:22.460]  And we know that...
[01:28:22.460 --> 01:28:24.420]  We put that out, Drudge had a top headline,
[01:28:24.420 --> 01:28:25.900]  there's Bill Clinton responding to us in real time.
[01:28:25.900 --> 01:28:27.900]  People are like, ooh, Bill Clinton responded to you.
[01:28:27.900 --> 01:28:29.620]  Bill Clinton had me beat up,
[01:28:29.620 --> 01:28:33.100]  it was probably Hillary in a parking lot 18 years ago,
[01:28:33.100 --> 01:28:35.740]  and they said, keep your mouth shut about Bill Clinton.
[01:28:37.180 --> 01:28:39.380]  I mean, I don't wanna tell the whole, no, Tim Kennedy,
[01:28:39.380 --> 01:28:41.860]  but they gotta attack right back.
[01:28:41.860 --> 01:28:44.380]  I couldn't believe I started beating a little hell out of him.
[01:28:44.380 --> 01:28:45.940]  I was like, what do you think, four guys attack me,
[01:28:45.940 --> 01:28:48.140]  and I'm not gonna open a big old can of Texas Kick-Ass
[01:28:48.140 --> 01:28:48.980]  on you?
[01:28:48.980 --> 01:28:52.660]  That's the thing about it too,
[01:28:52.660 --> 01:28:54.660]  sometimes I got in fights that I wasn't 100% the right,
[01:28:54.660 --> 01:28:55.500]  I had no strength.
[01:28:55.500 --> 01:28:57.540]  When really mean big men were attacking me,
[01:28:57.540 --> 01:28:59.340]  every time I threw a knee into them, ribs were breaking.
[01:28:59.340 --> 01:29:01.460]  Every time I grabbed them, I swam their head in the car,
[01:29:01.460 --> 01:29:03.060]  just their faces were smashed off.
[01:29:03.060 --> 01:29:05.180]  I punched one guy, tore his nose completely off.
[01:29:05.180 --> 01:29:07.100]  They were just like, what the hell?
[01:29:07.100 --> 01:29:10.260]  And I was like, you're not stopping this mission.
[01:29:10.260 --> 01:29:12.500]  Now go get in your Astro van and get the hell out of here,
[01:29:12.500 --> 01:29:14.180]  with blood just spewing down over my face.
[01:29:14.180 --> 01:29:15.780]  And you know what, I loved it.
[01:29:16.780 --> 01:29:18.420]  Because it's the animating contest of liberty.
[01:29:18.420 --> 01:29:20.780]  So let's finish up with this guy.
[01:29:20.780 --> 01:29:24.260]  Secretary Rice didn't do emails, smart girl,
[01:29:24.260 --> 01:29:27.260]  but our senior age did on personal devices,
[01:29:27.260 --> 01:29:30.500]  and we know that Secretary Kerry did until the law changed.
[01:29:31.860 --> 01:29:33.420]  They noticed he said smart girl.
[01:29:33.420 --> 01:29:35.380]  Guess who doesn't use email?
[01:29:35.380 --> 01:29:37.180]  Guess who never touches a keyboard?
[01:29:38.220 --> 01:29:41.740]  I have an assistant to it, I send text messages.
[01:29:41.740 --> 01:29:42.700]  That's not how I'm hiding anything,
[01:29:42.700 --> 01:29:45.100]  I just don't serve a big old computer.
[01:29:45.100 --> 01:29:47.500]  I call someone on the phone, the old fashioned,
[01:29:47.500 --> 01:29:49.140]  human to human, hey, yeah.
[01:29:49.140 --> 01:29:50.620]  They'll be back, stay with us, your call straight ahead.
[01:29:50.620 --> 01:29:54.340]  Here on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.340 --> 01:29:57.300]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.140 --> 01:30:02.460]  In recently released emails,
[01:30:02.460 --> 01:30:04.820]  a column pal's correspondence with a Democrat donor,
[01:30:04.820 --> 01:30:07.740]  pal gives the most succinct and accurate description ever
[01:30:07.740 --> 01:30:10.300]  of Hillary Clinton, saying she's a 70 year old person
[01:30:10.300 --> 01:30:14.820]  with a long track record, unbridled ambition, greedy.
[01:30:14.820 --> 01:30:16.140]  But it gets even better.
[01:30:16.140 --> 01:30:18.420]  They said, I'd rather not have to vote for her,
[01:30:18.420 --> 01:30:20.980]  although she is a friend I respect.
[01:30:20.980 --> 01:30:22.100]  Respect?
[01:30:22.100 --> 01:30:25.340]  No, he'll vote for her because she's part of the club.
[01:30:25.340 --> 01:30:27.980]  Like the establishment elitists of Bohemian Grove,
[01:30:27.980 --> 01:30:31.860]  whom Powell said in another email, absolutely hate Trump.
[01:30:31.860 --> 01:30:33.420]  Most of those of Bohemian Grove, he said,
[01:30:33.420 --> 01:30:35.980]  will vote against him, but quite a few will not vote
[01:30:35.980 --> 01:30:38.220]  for Hillary and will vote for a third party candidate.
[01:30:38.220 --> 01:30:40.260]  So while elitists gather in Bohemian Grove
[01:30:40.260 --> 01:30:42.260]  for, as the Washington Post describes it,
[01:30:42.260 --> 01:30:44.300]  heavy drinking, super secret talks,
[01:30:44.300 --> 01:30:46.260]  druid worship, and other rituals,
[01:30:46.260 --> 01:30:49.460]  you know, like mock child sacrifices to Mollick,
[01:30:49.460 --> 01:30:52.180]  those people, the Satan worshiping pedophiles,
[01:30:52.180 --> 01:30:54.900]  won't be voting for Trump, but they're just fine
[01:30:54.900 --> 01:30:56.980]  with Hillary and Gary Johnson.
[01:30:56.980 --> 01:30:58.780]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[01:31:01.020 --> 01:31:02.260]  More than two years ago,
[01:31:02.260 --> 01:31:04.980]  Infowars first told you about our research
[01:31:04.980 --> 01:31:07.500]  into what has been called the iodine conspiracy.
[01:31:07.500 --> 01:31:10.100]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades
[01:31:10.100 --> 01:31:12.940]  that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ,
[01:31:12.940 --> 01:31:15.940]  and how the government knowingly started taking iodine
[01:31:15.940 --> 01:31:17.820]  out of the food and adding fluoride,
[01:31:17.820 --> 01:31:20.500]  the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[01:31:20.500 --> 01:31:22.260]  They took the good halogen out
[01:31:22.260 --> 01:31:24.180]  and put the deadly halogen in.
[01:31:24.180 --> 01:31:26.220]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened,
[01:31:26.220 --> 01:31:27.900]  as it still is worsening today,
[01:31:27.900 --> 01:31:29.180]  I was there telling you
[01:31:29.180 --> 01:31:31.060]  how to prepare yourself and your family.
[01:31:31.060 --> 01:31:35.140]  Now in 2016, even more information has been revealed
[01:31:35.140 --> 01:31:38.340]  concerning the connection between iodine and the gut,
[01:31:38.340 --> 01:31:40.460]  which many experts are now saying
[01:31:40.460 --> 01:31:43.980]  that would be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[01:31:43.980 --> 01:31:45.820]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[01:31:45.820 --> 01:31:47.300]  This is the real deal, folks,
[01:31:47.300 --> 01:31:50.060]  and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view,
[01:31:50.060 --> 01:31:52.100]  to any optimum health regimen.

[01:32:00.740 --> 01:32:01.580]  Hey, everyone.
[01:32:01.580 --> 01:32:03.900]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of the Bright Side.
[01:32:03.900 --> 01:32:04.740]  And as many of you know,
[01:32:04.740 --> 01:32:07.700]  I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[01:32:07.700 --> 01:32:09.780]  You've all heard the shocking statistics
[01:32:09.780 --> 01:32:11.740]  despite spending trillions of dollars in healthcare,
[01:32:11.740 --> 01:32:15.460]  nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country.
[01:32:15.460 --> 01:32:17.740]  Obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease,
[01:32:17.740 --> 01:32:19.940]  and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[01:32:19.940 --> 01:32:21.260]  One out of three or four people
[01:32:21.260 --> 01:32:22.820]  is dealing with some kind of health challenge,
[01:32:22.820 --> 01:32:24.780]  and everyone knows at least one person
[01:32:24.780 --> 01:32:26.500]  with a degenerative disease.
[01:32:26.500 --> 01:32:28.060]  If you are dealing with a health challenge,
[01:32:28.060 --> 01:32:29.700]  or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor
[01:32:29.700 --> 01:32:31.980]  and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient,
[01:32:31.980 --> 01:32:34.580]  easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials
[01:32:34.580 --> 01:32:36.140]  into your day-to-day lives

[01:32:37.820 --> 01:32:40.220]  the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins,
[01:32:40.220 --> 01:32:42.020]  minerals, fats, and amino acids
[01:32:42.020 --> 01:32:43.780]  that needs to do its healing work,

[01:32:58.940 --> 01:33:04.940]  MUSIC
[01:33:04.940 --> 01:33:06.940]  Sound like we're going shabby.

[01:33:20.940 --> 01:33:26.940]  MUSIC
[01:33:26.940 --> 01:33:29.940]  From the infowarsteam.com News Center,
[01:33:29.940 --> 01:33:33.940]  deep behind enemy lines in occupied Texas,
[01:33:33.940 --> 01:33:35.940]  broadcasting worldwide,
[01:33:35.940 --> 01:33:38.940]  you're listening to the voice of human resistance
[01:33:38.940 --> 01:33:43.940]  against the technotronic technocracy tank-over.
[01:33:43.940 --> 01:33:46.940]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:33:46.940 --> 01:33:50.940]  If you want it, baby, you're about to get it.
[01:33:50.940 --> 01:33:56.940]  MUSIC
[01:33:56.940 --> 01:34:03.940]  MUSIC
[01:34:03.940 --> 01:34:05.940]  Will these dreams come true?
[01:34:05.940 --> 01:34:07.940]  What do black flag mean?
[01:34:07.940 --> 01:34:10.940]  What's a white flag mean?
[01:34:10.940 --> 01:34:15.940]  Black flags mean no surrender.
[01:34:15.940 --> 01:34:18.940]  Info wars only flag, black flags.
[01:34:18.940 --> 01:34:20.940]  In the control room, George Washington on them.
[01:34:20.940 --> 01:34:22.940]  They're black.
[01:34:22.940 --> 01:34:28.940]  MUSIC
[01:34:28.940 --> 01:34:31.940]  Only black.
[01:34:31.940 --> 01:34:34.940]  George Washington in gold.
[01:34:34.940 --> 01:34:39.940]  Eternity, unspoiled, transcended.
[01:34:39.940 --> 01:34:43.940]  1776, unstoppable.
[01:34:43.940 --> 01:34:46.940]  MUSIC
[01:34:46.940 --> 01:34:49.940]  But only if you take it in your hand.
[01:34:49.940 --> 01:34:52.940]  The sword from the stone.
[01:34:52.940 --> 01:34:55.940]  Who are the murderers of our age to bring forth
[01:34:55.940 --> 01:34:58.940]  the King Arthur to defeat the globalist
[01:34:58.940 --> 01:35:00.940]  and slay the dragon?
[01:35:00.940 --> 01:35:03.940]  Who can pull the sword from that stone?
[01:35:03.940 --> 01:35:06.940]  Jim Kennedy's coming in with a big exclusive.
[01:35:06.940 --> 01:35:11.940]  We're about to tweet some funny photos during the break.
[01:35:11.940 --> 01:35:13.940]  I ran back there in one of the green rooms.
[01:35:13.940 --> 01:35:16.940]  Kennedy was actually getting out of his boxing gear
[01:35:16.940 --> 01:35:18.940]  in the suit.
[01:35:18.940 --> 01:35:21.940]  We got some pictures of that coming up at Real Alex Jones.
[01:35:21.940 --> 01:35:23.940]  The fight's been announced, but he told us
[01:35:23.940 --> 01:35:25.940]  it wasn't supposed to be announced all day,
[01:35:25.940 --> 01:35:27.940]  but of course the guy announced it yesterday,
[01:35:27.940 --> 01:35:29.940]  but it's okay, he's going to give us the exclusive response
[01:35:29.940 --> 01:35:32.940]  to all that coming up here in studio.
[01:35:32.940 --> 01:35:35.940]  He's back there getting some lunch with Anthony
[01:35:35.940 --> 01:35:38.940]  and Shane Steiner and others.
[01:35:38.940 --> 01:35:40.940]  It's kind of a tombstone article here.
[01:35:40.940 --> 01:35:44.940]  Glenn Beck's bet on Ted Cruz, bad bet,
[01:35:44.940 --> 01:35:46.940]  the radio host plans for media dominance
[01:35:46.940 --> 01:35:48.940]  and political kingmaking are faltering
[01:35:48.940 --> 01:35:50.940]  because he's a total fake.
[01:35:50.940 --> 01:35:54.940]  Glenn Beck, this is really like a political obituary.
[01:35:54.940 --> 01:35:56.940]  I don't take pleasure in this, by the way.
[01:35:56.940 --> 01:35:58.940]  I'm not in competition with it.
[01:35:58.940 --> 01:36:00.940]  I love Right Bar 2's success.
[01:36:00.940 --> 01:36:02.940]  I love Michael Savage's success.
[01:36:02.940 --> 01:36:04.940]  I love the fact that Sean Hannity's got more hardcore.
[01:36:04.940 --> 01:36:06.940]  I mean, I don't want my guns to be taken.
[01:36:06.940 --> 01:36:08.940]  I don't want to be forced to take vaccines.
[01:36:08.940 --> 01:36:10.940]  I don't want to be put under a world government.
[01:36:10.940 --> 01:36:13.940]  I don't care less about being, you know,
[01:36:13.940 --> 01:36:15.940]  the talk show host with the most listeners
[01:36:15.940 --> 01:36:17.940]  on terrestrial radio.
[01:36:17.940 --> 01:36:20.940]  Now, it's just a fact that via internet, hands down,
[01:36:20.940 --> 01:36:22.940]  we are totally dominant.
[01:36:22.940 --> 01:36:24.940]  In a free market, we dominate.
[01:36:24.940 --> 01:36:26.940]  And we dominate on smaller stations
[01:36:26.940 --> 01:36:28.940]  up against, you know, big establishment hosts,
[01:36:28.940 --> 01:36:30.940]  but that isn't where I'm coming from.
[01:36:30.940 --> 01:36:32.940]  I don't need to feel big because I, you know,
[01:36:32.940 --> 01:36:34.940]  beat Rush Limbaugh on the ratings in this city
[01:36:34.940 --> 01:36:36.940]  and that city.
[01:36:36.940 --> 01:36:38.940]  I'm going after the globalists.
[01:36:38.940 --> 01:36:40.940]  I want to thank you for your support.
[01:36:40.940 --> 01:36:42.940]  We're going to go to Jr. and John and Heidi and Daniel
[01:36:42.940 --> 01:36:44.940]  and Sebastian and others here in just a moment.
[01:36:44.940 --> 01:36:46.940]  I appreciate you holding.
[01:36:46.940 --> 01:36:48.940]  Where do you think the election is going?
[01:36:48.940 --> 01:36:50.940]  Are you worried Hillers are going to pull a false flag?
[01:36:50.940 --> 01:36:52.940]  Because as confident as we are now and seeing good things happen
[01:36:52.940 --> 01:36:54.940]  and seeing Donald Trump talk about the new world order
[01:36:54.940 --> 01:36:56.940]  and globalism and reach out to Mexico
[01:36:56.940 --> 01:36:58.940]  and other countries and say, let's actually build
[01:36:58.940 --> 01:37:00.940]  real economies.
[01:37:00.940 --> 01:37:02.940]  As excited as I am,
[01:37:02.940 --> 01:37:04.940]  the spirit is rising.
[01:37:04.940 --> 01:37:06.940]  Liberty is rising,
[01:37:06.940 --> 01:37:08.940]  but evil is still
[01:37:08.940 --> 01:37:10.940]  in control of this rock.
[01:37:10.940 --> 01:37:12.940]  And so you're going to see
[01:37:12.940 --> 01:37:14.940]  major counterpunches thrown.
[01:37:14.940 --> 01:37:16.940]  What are those?
[01:37:16.940 --> 01:37:18.940]  We're going to hear calls in one minute.
[01:37:18.940 --> 01:37:20.940]  Before I go any further,
[01:37:20.940 --> 01:37:22.940]  Solutions from Science is probably
[01:37:22.940 --> 01:37:24.940]  our oldest sponsor.
[01:37:24.940 --> 01:37:26.940]  And from Solutions from Science
[01:37:26.940 --> 01:37:28.940]  just has a wide spectrum
[01:37:28.940 --> 01:37:30.940]  of amazing products.
[01:37:30.940 --> 01:37:32.940]  They've been around forever
[01:37:32.940 --> 01:37:34.940]  and the reason I love these guys
[01:37:34.940 --> 01:37:36.940]  is that they only produce the highest quality
[01:37:36.940 --> 01:37:38.940]  off the grid backup equipment.
[01:37:38.940 --> 01:37:40.940]  Folks should really listen
[01:37:40.940 --> 01:37:42.940]  because I wrote these words just yesterday
[01:37:42.940 --> 01:37:44.940]  as I was bringing them back on as a sponsor
[01:37:44.940 --> 01:37:46.940]  just thinking about over the years
[01:37:46.940 --> 01:37:48.940]  what Solutions from Science has done.
[01:37:48.940 --> 01:37:50.940]  A lot of things can cut your power
[01:37:50.940 --> 01:37:52.940]  including dangerous weather. Plus you should
[01:37:52.940 --> 01:37:54.940]  move towards getting off the grid
[01:37:54.940 --> 01:37:56.940]  and here's a way to affordably do that.
[01:37:56.940 --> 01:37:58.940]  We should put their website probably
[01:37:58.940 --> 01:38:00.940]  up on screen for folks.
[01:38:00.940 --> 01:38:02.940]  Solutions from Science is offering
[01:38:02.940 --> 01:38:04.940]  their new fast charge solar generator
[01:38:04.940 --> 01:38:06.940]  at a nice discount
[01:38:06.940 --> 01:38:08.940]  for my listeners. You can use it
[01:38:08.940 --> 01:38:10.940]  on demand in an outage or just
[01:38:10.940 --> 01:38:12.940]  use it
[01:38:12.940 --> 01:38:14.940]  every day if you want to save money
[01:38:14.940 --> 01:38:16.940]  on your electrical bill. Here's
[01:38:16.940 --> 01:38:18.940]  why this is so important.
[01:38:18.940 --> 01:38:20.940]  They had a big
[01:38:20.940 --> 01:38:22.940]  summer sale earlier and I've
[01:38:22.940 --> 01:38:24.940]  asked them to run the offer for a
[01:38:24.940 --> 01:38:26.940]  week or two more just for our listeners
[01:38:26.940 --> 01:38:28.940]  because the price was really at an all time
[01:38:28.940 --> 01:38:30.940]  low and I screwed around and didn't get back
[01:38:30.940 --> 01:38:32.940]  with them and didn't launch it during the sale.
[01:38:32.940 --> 01:38:34.940]  I screwed up so we're attending it.
[01:38:34.940 --> 01:38:36.940]  Half the time we extended sales because of that
[01:38:36.940 --> 01:38:38.940]  but anyways that's inside baseball.
[01:38:38.940 --> 01:38:40.940]  What I'm getting at here is
[01:38:40.940 --> 01:38:42.940]  that
[01:38:42.940 --> 01:38:44.940]  you can get it
[01:38:44.940 --> 01:38:46.940]  right now.
[01:38:46.940 --> 01:38:48.940]  So I want
[01:38:48.940 --> 01:38:50.940]  one of these
[01:38:50.940 --> 01:38:52.940]  units to be in every house out there
[01:38:52.940 --> 01:38:54.940]  because it's just a great system. They got a whole bunch
[01:38:54.940 --> 01:38:56.940]  of different systems.
[01:38:56.940 --> 01:38:58.940]  Some of these generators produce electricity from the sun
[01:38:58.940 --> 01:39:00.940]  and unlike gas generators
[01:39:00.940 --> 01:39:02.940]  run silently with no toxic fumes.
[01:39:02.940 --> 01:39:04.940]  Go to

[01:40:02.940 --> 01:40:04.940]  I don't particularly like doing it but
[01:40:04.940 --> 01:40:06.940]  when I was 40 everybody said go and get a medical checkup
[01:40:06.940 --> 01:40:08.940]  when's the last time you were at the doctor and I said never
[01:40:08.940 --> 01:40:10.940]  I don't go for checkups you know
[01:40:10.940 --> 01:40:12.940]  cut my finger off had to go get that sewn back on
[01:40:12.940 --> 01:40:14.940]  15 years ago but other than that I don't go to the doctor
[01:40:14.940 --> 01:40:16.940]  and they said well you need to go
[01:40:16.940 --> 01:40:18.940]  so I went and had all the checkups and the blood taken
[01:40:18.940 --> 01:40:20.940]  and you know the doctor
[01:40:20.940 --> 01:40:22.940]  cut my finger you know where I mean it's not fun
[01:40:22.940 --> 01:40:24.940]  the point is is that you go and get all that
[01:40:24.940 --> 01:40:26.940]  checked and the doctor was just
[01:40:26.940 --> 01:40:28.940]  like well you're all pretty good here except your sugars
[01:40:28.940 --> 01:40:30.940]  or borderline, borderline
[01:40:30.940 --> 01:40:32.940]  diabetic not borderline but getting into borderline
[01:40:32.940 --> 01:40:34.940]  so you know what are you doing and blah blah blah
[01:40:34.940 --> 01:40:36.940]  so we talked about that and he said well hey
[01:40:36.940 --> 01:40:38.940]  vitamin B12 prescription
[01:40:38.940 --> 01:40:40.940]  he also said how would you like some
[01:40:40.940 --> 01:40:42.940]  Viagra and Cialis prescriptions
[01:40:42.940 --> 01:40:44.940]  they actually gave me two
[01:40:44.940 --> 01:40:46.940]  I said well I don't have trouble in that department
[01:40:46.940 --> 01:40:48.940]  sugar mice will try it I've always heard of it's been around forever
[01:40:48.940 --> 01:40:50.940]  so I tried them didn't
[01:40:50.940 --> 01:40:52.940]  really do anything Cialis a little bit
[01:40:52.940 --> 01:40:54.940]  Viagra just made me kind of see blurred
[01:40:54.940 --> 01:40:56.940]  and like have a headache
[01:40:56.940 --> 01:40:58.940]  I just don't need it
[01:40:58.940 --> 01:41:00.940]  super male mortality for me personally
[01:41:00.940 --> 01:41:02.940]  that's what everybody talks about that we don't even pitch it
[01:41:02.940 --> 01:41:04.940]  for a little beat up but just just to give
[01:41:04.940 --> 01:41:06.940]  you an idea what these herbs are doing it is
[01:41:06.940 --> 01:41:08.940]  it is strong
[01:41:08.940 --> 01:41:10.940]  and it is dramatic and I
[01:41:10.940 --> 01:41:12.940]  feel the results within one day and that's what everybody
[01:41:12.940 --> 01:41:14.940]  really talks about with super male and super
[01:41:14.940 --> 01:41:16.940]  female same deal for women
[01:41:16.940 --> 01:41:18.940]  it is amazing
[01:41:18.940 --> 01:41:20.940]  and they're just suppressing naturally
[01:41:20.940 --> 01:41:22.940]  how we really are how we really feel
[01:41:22.940 --> 01:41:24.940]  but when we sell stuff like super male
[01:41:24.940 --> 01:41:26.940]  vitality and the national media makes fun
[01:41:26.940 --> 01:41:28.940]  of it we only get more sales I mean this is
[01:41:28.940 --> 01:41:30.940]  really good high quality stuff
[01:41:30.940 --> 01:41:32.940]  we have a lot of their specials running as well at
[01:41:32.940 --> 01:41:34.940]  infowarslife.com or call toll 3888
[01:41:34.940 --> 01:41:36.940]  2533139
[01:41:38.940 --> 01:41:40.940]  and it takes a lot of money to fund this operation
[01:41:40.940 --> 01:41:42.940]  thank god we have such a giant audience
[01:41:42.940 --> 01:41:44.940]  but I gotta tell you it is mainly the Christian
[01:41:44.940 --> 01:41:46.940]  conservatives
[01:41:46.940 --> 01:41:48.940]  who are the funders
[01:41:48.940 --> 01:41:50.940]  of this show I mean we know demographically
[01:41:50.940 --> 01:41:52.940]  statistically and it just shows how that's why the
[01:41:52.940 --> 01:41:54.940]  global state Christians because even though they've
[01:41:54.940 --> 01:41:56.940]  captured the Christian church to a great extent even though
[01:41:56.940 --> 01:41:58.940]  there's all this corruption the average person that loves
[01:41:58.940 --> 01:42:00.940]  God and loves people and cares
[01:42:00.940 --> 01:42:02.940]  six times more often gives a charity
[01:42:02.940 --> 01:42:04.940]  international studies show Christians
[01:42:04.940 --> 01:42:06.940]  more often helps somebody in need
[01:42:06.940 --> 01:42:08.940]  a Christian and it's not
[01:42:08.940 --> 01:42:10.940]  just some mindset it's a spirit
[01:42:10.940 --> 01:42:12.940]  of caring
[01:42:12.940 --> 01:42:14.940]  about people and
[01:42:16.940 --> 01:42:18.940]  I humbly say I'm a Christian I don't say that
[01:42:18.940 --> 01:42:20.940]  on some you know mountain
[01:42:20.940 --> 01:42:22.940]  top and I'm the big Christian I'm the
[01:42:22.940 --> 01:42:24.940]  holier than now Christian and that's the spirit
[01:42:24.940 --> 01:42:26.940]  of the devil
[01:42:28.940 --> 01:42:30.940]  I'm ashamed of
[01:42:30.940 --> 01:42:32.940]  some of the things I do even though I'm a moral
[01:42:32.940 --> 01:42:34.940]  person on average and people you know
[01:42:34.940 --> 01:42:36.940]  I'm a guy you can trust what I say
[01:42:36.940 --> 01:42:38.940]  and you know I'm a good guy but still
[01:42:38.940 --> 01:42:40.940]  just because I can look into evil just because I
[01:42:40.940 --> 01:42:42.940]  can imagine things I feel
[01:42:42.940 --> 01:42:44.940]  guilty and that's good because that means
[01:42:44.940 --> 01:42:46.940]  I'm not going to ever get into all that
[01:42:46.940 --> 01:42:48.940]  it's just these people that think they're perfect
[01:42:48.940 --> 01:42:50.940]  and they can do no wrong I mean they're the dangerous
[01:42:50.940 --> 01:42:52.940]  ones folks and that's the type of Hillary
[01:42:52.940 --> 01:42:54.940]  Clinton's that think we're so stupid she can be
[01:42:54.940 --> 01:42:56.940]  falling down having seizures
[01:42:56.940 --> 01:42:58.940]  and tell us she's fine even though
[01:42:58.940 --> 01:43:00.940]  she hasn't been seen in public in days
[01:43:00.940 --> 01:43:02.940]  since since since Monday
[01:43:02.940 --> 01:43:04.940]  or yeah since Sunday
[01:43:04.940 --> 01:43:06.940]  I mean big stuff's happening history's happening
[01:43:06.940 --> 01:43:08.940]  is what I'm saying so thank you for the support

[01:43:28.940 --> 01:43:30.940]  minutes ago when I gave the number out I said
[01:43:30.940 --> 01:43:32.940]  what dirty tricks will they play will there be a
[01:43:32.940 --> 01:43:34.940]  false flag what's your gut tell you will
[01:43:34.940 --> 01:43:36.940]  they try to replace Hillary they're openly floating
[01:43:36.940 --> 01:43:38.940]  out there now where does all this go
[01:43:38.940 --> 01:43:40.940]  what what do you think is happening
[01:43:40.940 --> 01:43:42.940]  let's talk to
[01:43:42.940 --> 01:43:44.940]  junior in Colorado thanks for holding
[01:43:44.940 --> 01:43:46.940]  hey Alex how are you
[01:43:46.940 --> 01:43:48.940]  good
[01:43:48.940 --> 01:43:50.940]  hey this is junior calling from FEMA region 8
[01:43:50.940 --> 01:43:52.940]  and just a little background
[01:43:52.940 --> 01:43:54.940]  I actually was an audio engineer
[01:43:54.940 --> 01:43:56.940]  and got contracted to do a bunch of the
[01:43:56.940 --> 01:43:58.940]  Democratic Party
[01:43:58.940 --> 01:44:00.940]  events back in 2008
[01:44:00.940 --> 01:44:02.940]  and I don't know if you got a second for me to give you a little backstory
[01:44:02.940 --> 01:44:04.940]  go ahead
[01:44:04.940 --> 01:44:06.940]  big
[01:44:06.940 --> 01:44:08.940]  I did a bunch of the Hillary events
[01:44:08.940 --> 01:44:10.940]  Bill used to show up he'd be a rock star
[01:44:10.940 --> 01:44:12.940]  the women would just go crazy
[01:44:12.940 --> 01:44:14.940]  so
[01:44:14.940 --> 01:44:16.940]  I really
[01:44:16.940 --> 01:44:18.940]  thought that Hillary was the one back then and then
[01:44:18.940 --> 01:44:20.940]  suddenly got turned on
[01:44:20.940 --> 01:44:22.940]  to some of your documentaries and all that
[01:44:22.940 --> 01:44:24.940]  and I got away
[01:44:24.940 --> 01:44:26.940]  and I just wanted to thank you for that
[01:44:26.940 --> 01:44:28.940]  and I've been
[01:44:28.940 --> 01:44:30.940]  turning people on until you ever sit
[01:44:30.940 --> 01:44:32.940]  and what I think
[01:44:32.940 --> 01:44:34.940]  happened it's been a while since
[01:44:34.940 --> 01:44:36.940]  Obama has played the race card
[01:44:36.940 --> 01:44:38.940]  and we haven't heard from the Black Lives Matter
[01:44:38.940 --> 01:44:40.940]  in a while
[01:44:44.940 --> 01:44:46.940]  what are you getting at specifically
[01:44:46.940 --> 01:44:48.940]  pardon
[01:44:48.940 --> 01:44:50.940]  I was getting a sandwich listening to you
[01:44:50.940 --> 01:44:52.940]  that's when I had my lunches during callers
[01:44:52.940 --> 01:44:54.940]  specifically what are you saying
[01:44:54.940 --> 01:44:56.940]  about Black Lives Matter
[01:44:56.940 --> 01:44:58.940]  well I'm just saying that we haven't heard from Obama
[01:44:58.940 --> 01:45:00.940]  playing the race card in quite a while here
[01:45:00.940 --> 01:45:02.940]  and what is Black Lives Matter
[01:45:02.940 --> 01:45:04.940]  sitting on all that money that Soros gave him
[01:45:04.940 --> 01:45:06.940]  well absolutely
[01:45:06.940 --> 01:45:08.940]  I mean that whole thing
[01:45:08.940 --> 01:45:10.940]  blew up in their face
[01:45:10.940 --> 01:45:12.940]  but now with the Ford Foundation
[01:45:12.940 --> 01:45:14.940]  giving another hundred million two weeks ago
[01:45:14.940 --> 01:45:16.940]  it shows that they've got another phase of that
[01:45:16.940 --> 01:45:18.940]  coming out and this whole NFL
[01:45:18.940 --> 01:45:20.940]  thing
[01:45:20.940 --> 01:45:22.940]  not standing for the 9-11 victims
[01:45:22.940 --> 01:45:24.940]  is kind of the reboot and the relaunch
[01:45:24.940 --> 01:45:26.940]  of that to make it look really sexy and cool
[01:45:26.940 --> 01:45:28.940]  absolutely
[01:45:28.940 --> 01:45:30.940]  and I just can't believe all the idiots
[01:45:30.940 --> 01:45:32.940]  that just follow along with this program
[01:45:32.940 --> 01:45:34.940]  that they're throwing out here
[01:45:34.940 --> 01:45:36.940]  but for them to be sitting on all this money
[01:45:36.940 --> 01:45:38.940]  if something's got to come up
[01:45:38.940 --> 01:45:40.940]  and if you ask me what's going to happen
[01:45:40.940 --> 01:45:42.940]  now that fall flag is going to be with them
[01:45:42.940 --> 01:45:44.940]  and with Black Lives Matter
[01:45:44.940 --> 01:45:46.940]  and do you agree with me that
[01:45:46.940 --> 01:45:48.940]  it'll blow up in their face but still they're so arrogant
[01:45:48.940 --> 01:45:50.940]  they're going to pull it
[01:45:50.940 --> 01:45:52.940]  oh absolutely I think the day it happens
[01:45:52.940 --> 01:45:54.940]  the following day it'll probably be shown
[01:45:54.940 --> 01:45:56.940]  you know Soros funded it
[01:45:56.940 --> 01:45:58.940]  and arrested the Ford Foundation
[01:45:58.940 --> 01:46:00.940]  and people will just go right along with it though
[01:46:00.940 --> 01:46:02.940]  well you know when you look at comic books
[01:46:02.940 --> 01:46:04.940]  and things at least the bad guy in most comic books
[01:46:04.940 --> 01:46:06.940]  knows when he's been beaten
[01:46:06.940 --> 01:46:08.940]  and then he sneaks off to reorganize
[01:46:08.940 --> 01:46:10.940]  these people just keep attacking and attacking
[01:46:10.940 --> 01:46:12.940]  and that works when they've got the high hand
[01:46:12.940 --> 01:46:14.940]  they don't have the high hand anymore
[01:46:14.940 --> 01:46:16.940]  Junior thank you so much sorry I took a bite of my sandwich
[01:46:16.940 --> 01:46:18.940]  it was too delicious looking over there
[01:46:18.940 --> 01:46:20.940]  and I was trying to let you talk so thank you great points
[01:46:20.940 --> 01:46:22.940]  let's talk to Sebastian in Argentina
[01:46:22.940 --> 01:46:24.940]  I should have gone to you first Sebastian
[01:46:24.940 --> 01:46:26.940]  I apologize I didn't look at where you were calling from
[01:46:26.940 --> 01:46:28.940]  go ahead
[01:46:28.940 --> 01:46:30.940]  Hi Alex I'm from Argentina
[01:46:30.940 --> 01:46:32.940]  and what I'm going to tell you
[01:46:32.940 --> 01:46:34.940]  is what I've been denouncing since 2011
[01:46:34.940 --> 01:46:36.940]  in the United States capital
[01:46:36.940 --> 01:46:38.940]  under bill HR 3783
[01:46:38.940 --> 01:46:40.940]  in 2011
[01:46:40.940 --> 01:46:42.940]  I denounced
[01:46:42.940 --> 01:46:44.940]  that Argentina has been engaged
[01:46:44.940 --> 01:46:46.940]  in nuclear term for technology
[01:46:46.940 --> 01:46:48.940]  from Argentina to run via Venezuela
[01:46:48.940 --> 01:46:50.940]  I made that statement
[01:46:50.940 --> 01:46:52.940]  on the foreign relations committee
[01:46:52.940 --> 01:46:54.940]  of the United States Senate
[01:46:54.940 --> 01:46:56.940]  and then Secretary Kerry
[01:46:56.940 --> 01:46:58.940]  was the chairman
[01:46:58.940 --> 01:47:00.940]  of the full committee of the
[01:47:00.940 --> 01:47:02.940]  of the House
[01:47:02.940 --> 01:47:04.940]  so he led me
[01:47:04.940 --> 01:47:06.940]  to start that denounce
[01:47:06.940 --> 01:47:08.940]  but after he was replaced
[01:47:08.940 --> 01:47:10.940]  for Secretary Clinton
[01:47:10.940 --> 01:47:12.940]  and then
[01:47:12.940 --> 01:47:14.940]  so let me stop you real quick Sebastian
[01:47:14.940 --> 01:47:16.940]  because you should probably send us your contact info
[01:47:16.940 --> 01:47:18.940]  we should probably have you as a guest
[01:47:18.940 --> 01:47:20.940]  I mean I remember some of those hearings that were going on
[01:47:20.940 --> 01:47:22.940]  back at the time but first try to get off speakerphone
[01:47:22.940 --> 01:47:24.940]  so we can hear you better
[01:47:24.940 --> 01:47:26.940]  and then explain who you are
[01:47:26.940 --> 01:47:28.940]  and the specifics of your case
[01:47:28.940 --> 01:47:30.940]  yeah I'm not in speakerphone
[01:47:30.940 --> 01:47:32.940]  this is an overseas phone call
[01:47:32.940 --> 01:47:34.940]  that's why it has some delay
[01:47:34.940 --> 01:47:36.940]  got it I understand now it's just real blown out
[01:47:36.940 --> 01:47:38.940]  go ahead we'll just back off the receiver then
[01:47:38.940 --> 01:47:40.940]  yeah okay
[01:47:40.940 --> 01:47:42.940]  since 1997
[01:47:42.940 --> 01:47:44.940]  I am fighting globalism
[01:47:44.940 --> 01:47:46.940]  in 97
[01:47:46.940 --> 01:47:48.940]  I was invited for
[01:47:48.940 --> 01:47:50.940]  president Saddam Hussein
[01:47:50.940 --> 01:47:52.940]  in order to
[01:47:52.940 --> 01:47:54.940]  to show me which is the real
[01:47:54.940 --> 01:47:56.940]  situation back in Iraq
[01:47:56.940 --> 01:47:58.940]  because in the late 80s
[01:47:58.940 --> 01:48:00.940]  Argentina was transferred nuclear technology
[01:48:00.940 --> 01:48:02.940]  to Iraq
[01:48:02.940 --> 01:48:04.940]  so I went to Iraq invited by
[01:48:04.940 --> 01:48:06.940]  the president in order to confirm
[01:48:06.940 --> 01:48:08.940]  that the
[01:48:08.940 --> 01:48:10.940]  nuclear technology
[01:48:10.940 --> 01:48:12.940]  that we have been transferred in the 80s
[01:48:12.940 --> 01:48:14.940]  has been cancelled and transferred to Libya
[01:48:14.940 --> 01:48:16.940]  okay so listen Sebastian
[01:48:16.940 --> 01:48:18.940]  we're talking about false flags
[01:48:18.940 --> 01:48:20.940]  in the election
[01:48:20.940 --> 01:48:22.940]  you sound like an interesting person I believe you're telling us the truth
[01:48:22.940 --> 01:48:24.940]  we'll put you on hold
[01:48:24.940 --> 01:48:26.940]  give us your email contact
[01:48:26.940 --> 01:48:28.940]  we can look up your story
[01:48:28.940 --> 01:48:30.940]  you sound like an interesting person to have on the broadcast
[01:48:30.940 --> 01:48:32.940]  but we're screening calls
[01:48:32.940 --> 01:48:34.940]  in that we're taking calls on the election
[01:48:34.940 --> 01:48:36.940]  and on false flags
[01:48:36.940 --> 01:48:38.940]  and where we think this is going but thank you
[01:48:38.940 --> 01:48:40.940]  get Sebastian's email and we'll contact him
[01:48:40.940 --> 01:48:42.940]  sounds like an incredible caller
[01:48:42.940 --> 01:48:44.940]  and I appreciate him calling in
[01:48:44.940 --> 01:48:46.940]  who he is and what he's talking about
[01:48:46.940 --> 01:48:48.940]  because if I can't figure it out
[01:48:48.940 --> 01:48:50.940]  I bet a lot of the audience can't either
[01:48:50.940 --> 01:48:52.940]  let's go ahead and take another call here
[01:48:52.940 --> 01:48:54.940]  let's go ahead and talk to
[01:48:54.940 --> 01:48:56.940]  Daniel in Florida
[01:48:56.940 --> 01:48:58.940]  Daniel you're on the air
[01:48:58.940 --> 01:49:00.940]  hello Alex
[01:49:00.940 --> 01:49:02.940]  yes go ahead
[01:49:02.940 --> 01:49:04.940]  hey Alex yeah first time caller
[01:49:04.940 --> 01:49:06.940]  here I just want to say thank you
[01:49:06.940 --> 01:49:08.940]  good work man
[01:49:08.940 --> 01:49:10.940]  thank you brother
[01:49:10.940 --> 01:49:12.940]  so what I think is going to happen
[01:49:12.940 --> 01:49:14.940]  they're going to try to control the narrative
[01:49:14.940 --> 01:49:16.940]  by trying to
[01:49:16.940 --> 01:49:18.940]  either assassinate Hillary
[01:49:18.940 --> 01:49:20.940]  or having Bill die from
[01:49:20.940 --> 01:49:22.940]  natural causes to try to garner
[01:49:22.940 --> 01:49:24.940]  the sympathy vote
[01:49:24.940 --> 01:49:26.940]  or
[01:49:26.940 --> 01:49:28.940]  maybe like right before the debate
[01:49:28.940 --> 01:49:30.940]  they can you know weaken to Hillary's
[01:49:30.940 --> 01:49:32.940]  you know her for at least a day
[01:49:32.940 --> 01:49:34.940]  and then either
[01:49:34.940 --> 01:49:36.940]  absolutely she is a dead political commodity now
[01:49:36.940 --> 01:49:38.940]  she is like trash that has to be taken out
[01:49:38.940 --> 01:49:40.940]  and so I'm just asking
[01:49:40.940 --> 01:49:42.940]  how are they going to try to make her look like a bigger victim
[01:49:42.940 --> 01:49:44.940]  because they just admitted she was sick
[01:49:44.940 --> 01:49:46.940]  she could be the victim now they've been caught lying about it
[01:49:46.940 --> 01:49:48.940]  all their credibility is on the line
[01:49:48.940 --> 01:49:50.940]  this is a can of worms
[01:49:52.940 --> 01:49:54.940]  yeah it's absolutely ridiculous Alex
[01:49:54.940 --> 01:49:56.940]  and one thing I got to say is
[01:49:56.940 --> 01:49:58.940]  Julian Saundre is
[01:49:58.940 --> 01:50:00.940]  biding his time to release these
[01:50:00.940 --> 01:50:02.940]  other leaks
[01:50:02.940 --> 01:50:04.940]  yeah they're supposed to come out this week
[01:50:04.940 --> 01:50:06.940]  they're supposed to come out like right now
[01:50:06.940 --> 01:50:08.940]  yeah but like I think as soon as
[01:50:08.940 --> 01:50:10.940]  like he tried I think they have someone
[01:50:10.940 --> 01:50:12.940]  waiting in the wings to like form
[01:50:12.940 --> 01:50:14.940]  a false flag on Trump
[01:50:14.940 --> 01:50:16.940]  or maybe even you know
[01:50:16.940 --> 01:50:18.940]  Obama because
[01:50:18.940 --> 01:50:20.940]  they want to control the news
[01:50:20.940 --> 01:50:22.940]  cycle and they want to cancel the debate
[01:50:22.940 --> 01:50:24.940]  well they're
[01:50:24.940 --> 01:50:26.940]  openly talking in the Washington Post about having
[01:50:26.940 --> 01:50:28.940]  pneumonia until the end of October
[01:50:28.940 --> 01:50:30.940]  but her doctor said don't worry
[01:50:30.940 --> 01:50:32.940]  it's non-communicable
[01:50:32.940 --> 01:50:34.940]  non-infectious
[01:50:34.940 --> 01:50:36.940]  you know bacterial
[01:50:36.940 --> 01:50:38.940]  pneumonia which doesn't exist
[01:50:38.940 --> 01:50:40.940]  so they just wrote that
[01:50:40.940 --> 01:50:42.940]  after the fact to cover her
[01:50:42.940 --> 01:50:44.940]  coming up to the little girl
[01:50:44.940 --> 01:50:46.940]  I mean you can see them scripting all this in live time
[01:50:46.940 --> 01:50:48.940]  thank you Daniel

[01:55:12.220 --> 01:55:15.660]  Kennedy's whole story on this is so interesting it's an Americana story of
[01:55:15.660 --> 01:55:20.260]  his army soldier wrestler in high school gets to the military it's a
[01:55:20.260 --> 01:55:23.980]  special forces serves all these tours and then he has to fight these guys are
[01:55:23.980 --> 01:55:28.420]  all roided up they always get caught using rights he doesn't use rights it's
[01:55:28.420 --> 01:55:31.540]  gonna be a big deal right now let's go back to your phone calls let's talk to
[01:55:31.540 --> 01:55:37.100]  Heidi in Virginia Heidi you're on the air hi Alex first time caller thank you
[01:55:37.100 --> 01:55:40.500]  for taking my call and please take small bites of that sandwich we don't need
[01:55:40.500 --> 01:55:46.060]  you choking to death on us I'm absolutely I'm absolutely all in for
[01:55:46.060 --> 01:55:49.900]  Donald Trump but if in fact the nomination was stolen from Bernie
[01:55:49.900 --> 01:55:54.020]  Sanders why haven't we heard a word from him he fought the fight he had the
[01:55:54.020 --> 01:55:59.020]  supporters and the donations could he still be a legally viable candidate or
[01:55:59.020 --> 01:56:02.620]  did the Clintons give him hush money to shut up and go away the whole game's
[01:56:02.620 --> 01:56:06.980]  changed now their side seems to change the rules every time when blows back to
[01:56:06.980 --> 01:56:11.820]  you Alex well that's true I mean Sanders is a globalist he's a socialist
[01:56:11.820 --> 01:56:16.500]  he's a he's a he's a punk he's a guy that never worked today in his life
[01:56:16.500 --> 01:56:20.620]  they have a paycheck till he was 40 he lives in fantasy land his wife goes and
[01:56:20.620 --> 01:56:24.300]  bankrupts colleges he's you know got all these mansions and luxury lake houses
[01:56:24.300 --> 01:56:28.460]  and you know farts around getting big book deals now that you know doesn't sell
[01:56:28.460 --> 01:56:32.180]  a single book but I don't care he just gets the money so he's a flop he's a
[01:56:32.180 --> 01:56:38.100]  fake he's a joke so of course he's not coming back to the race some are
[01:56:38.100 --> 01:56:43.540]  talking about drafting him in or Joe Biden but the system doesn't want doesn't
[01:56:43.540 --> 01:56:46.820]  want him they want somebody they've known for a long time it's a good question
[01:56:46.820 --> 01:56:50.780]  though Heidi thank you let's go to Jonathan in Georgia you're on the air
[01:56:50.780 --> 01:56:56.100]  thanks for calling yeah brother just got started on the products a couple of
[01:56:56.100 --> 01:57:02.860]  months ago and alone I just wanted to say that the products were fine my comments
[01:57:02.860 --> 01:57:07.860]  come from what's about to happen with the International Monetary Fund on
[01:57:07.860 --> 01:57:14.580]  October 1st oddly the same time that we lose our free internet if you want or
[01:57:14.580 --> 01:57:20.540]  the Rememby is able to come in as one of the reserve currencies and the dollar
[01:57:20.540 --> 01:57:24.820]  and loses its reserve currency status it won't matter what we have as far as an
[01:57:24.820 --> 01:57:28.900]  election goes because that will crush the American economy bring it to
[01:57:28.900 --> 01:57:33.180]  its knees and lead us wide open for whatever they want to do well that's
[01:57:33.180 --> 01:57:35.980]  right the globalists have put us into position to being totally controlled by
[01:57:35.980 --> 01:57:42.340]  fiat currency we're in massive debt we've been set up for a fall and they may
[01:57:42.340 --> 01:57:45.660]  try to blame Trump for that fall but I think the public's gonna be too smart
[01:57:45.660 --> 01:57:49.580]  to do that the problem is there's no currency yet to replace it even though
[01:57:49.580 --> 01:57:53.060]  I know they have the STR strategic drawing rights and I think with
[01:57:53.060 --> 01:57:56.860]  America's will and with the president people supported we could probably
[01:57:56.860 --> 01:58:00.900]  stabilize global currencies then phase out of it but I hear you huge things are
[01:58:00.900 --> 01:58:04.300]  happening I'm glad a caller you know called in on topic to specifically talk
[01:58:04.300 --> 01:58:07.620]  about big concerns about what they might pull out of the election because you
[01:58:07.620 --> 01:58:14.500]  know with 53 days left they're gonna pull something right what else do you
[01:58:14.500 --> 01:58:20.740]  think they might do Jonathan I still believe that the currency is gonna be
[01:58:20.740 --> 01:58:24.740]  the way that they come in and shut down everything overnight because that will
[01:58:24.740 --> 01:58:29.380]  create enough to in order for Obama to hold off the election we got to get
[01:58:29.380 --> 01:58:32.620]  things straightened out we'll get back to it eventually but right now here's
[01:58:32.620 --> 01:58:37.420]  what we need to do and that that is the beginning of the end of my view that's
[01:58:37.420 --> 01:58:40.500]  right they've been organizing for a collapse getting ready we'll be back
[01:58:40.500 --> 01:58:51.940]  stay with us is 21st century warfare we're facing GCN third-hour straight ahead more calls and then Tim Kennedy

[02:01:00.940 --> 02:01:04.500]  them all the time why are it disproportionate amount of UFC fighters
[02:01:04.500 --> 02:01:09.500]  conspiracy theorists because they're independent type people that are willing

[02:02:39.340 --> 02:02:45.820]  the cost of them anyway sorry you were plugging the product up go back to your
[02:02:45.820 --> 02:02:51.620]  political point actually you know what they tried to start a war 1999
[02:02:51.620 --> 02:02:58.700]  pristine airport using us and the Russians we disobeyed a direct order
[02:02:58.700 --> 02:03:04.760]  from general Clark had a shape right I remember that they were good the they
[02:03:04.760 --> 02:03:08.220]  were taking pristine other bringing the Muslims and the Russians landed and then
[02:03:08.220 --> 02:03:11.740]  they ordered you to attack them and then you said no yeah we still we stood down
[02:03:11.740 --> 02:03:16.820]  because you got an order from Lord Jackson our brigadier Mike Jackson at
[02:03:16.820 --> 02:03:22.820]  the time he said all the units at the airport stand down stand down because
[02:03:22.820 --> 02:03:26.300]  it was a class five piece of equipment that shot down the stealth fighter the
[02:03:26.300 --> 02:03:33.380]  F1 17 ad hoc I love to have you guys sometime well tell us about where you
[02:03:33.380 --> 02:03:37.740]  were at the time and what happened well at the time I was right at the airport
[02:03:37.740 --> 02:03:44.500]  and we saw Russian forces to be tier 80s there were four left 25 reconnaissance
[02:03:44.500 --> 02:03:51.780]  vehicles and a warrior was about nine pairs on top of it and we shut down our
[02:03:51.780 --> 02:03:56.700]  engines right away because that's a sign of hostility right and then we got
[02:03:56.700 --> 02:04:03.940]  orders because we had no fight 24 sets so about maybe 16 of us heard the orders
[02:04:03.940 --> 02:04:12.380]  and one of the orders was go through them you know if they you know as soon
[02:04:12.380 --> 02:04:17.060]  we start our engines up they point their weapons at us we put our weapons at them
[02:04:17.060 --> 02:04:22.580]  and I was looking at some kid through my GPMG and he probably knew he was gonna
[02:04:22.580 --> 02:04:28.420]  die but they're like 45 seconds is nobody pulls a trigger because we all knew
[02:04:28.420 --> 02:04:33.380]  what the consequences was always gonna mean all NATO was telling you attack
[02:04:33.380 --> 02:04:37.820]  the Russians when they had when when the West was illegally taking over that
[02:04:37.820 --> 02:04:41.940]  southern airport for the Islamic invasion to take over incredible that's what I
[02:04:41.940 --> 02:04:45.020]  want robots because they will follow the illegal orders I'll tell you what
[02:04:45.020 --> 02:04:49.620]  Canada Canadian soldier if you can hold a while I want to bring you back on now
[02:04:49.620 --> 02:04:52.660]  when Tim Kennedy's on if you can't have not give us your address we're gonna
[02:04:52.660 --> 02:04:57.460]  shoot you two bottles of DNA force free and some other products as well from
[02:04:57.460 --> 02:05:03.900]  m4slife.com God bless you sir could this be the last month we have uncensored
[02:05:03.900 --> 02:05:07.980]  free internet here in the United States the president has decided the US will
[02:05:07.980 --> 02:05:12.220]  no longer oversee an open uncensored internet here and unless Congress steps
[02:05:12.220 --> 02:05:15.780]  in he will begin transition of stewardship to the United Nations
[02:05:15.780 --> 02:05:19.460]  now this new power grab will be given to authoritarian governments who have a
[02:05:19.460 --> 02:05:23.820]  vested interest in censoring undesirable content on the web the US
[02:05:23.820 --> 02:05:28.420]  Congress and its leaders led by Senator Ted Cruz are engaged in an all-out war

[02:05:32.460 --> 02:05:36.540]  will hand over their power on September the 30th and that's a move even former
[02:05:36.540 --> 02:05:40.100]  president Bill Clinton warned quote a lot of people who've been trying to take
[02:05:40.100 --> 02:05:44.220]  this authority away from the US want to do it for the sole purpose of cracking
[02:05:44.220 --> 02:05:47.860]  down on internet freedom and limiting it and having governments protect their
[02:05:47.860 --> 02:05:52.020]  backsides instead of empower their people and our own president is in
[02:05:52.020 --> 02:05:55.780]  locked up with this power grab an undeniable blow to free speech I'm

[02:08:56.420 --> 02:09:03.060]  sport tough and obviously this election 53 days left this is probably the most
[02:09:03.060 --> 02:09:09.580]  important election in modern US history even mainline analysts are openly
[02:09:09.580 --> 02:09:16.220]  saying that right now well if you look at what's happening in the fight world
[02:09:16.220 --> 02:09:20.140]  it's just as historical just as epic and it wasn't supposed to get announced
[02:09:20.140 --> 02:09:23.780]  till today but I got announced yesterday but we've got Tim Kennedy here with his
[02:09:23.780 --> 02:09:28.580]  exclusive first look response here in Austin Texas where he lives training
[02:09:28.580 --> 02:09:33.260]  right down the road from the info wars.com news studios so I want to thank
[02:09:33.260 --> 02:09:37.900]  Tim for offering to come on here and give us the exclusive today Tim thank you
[02:09:37.900 --> 02:09:41.940]  awesome thanks for having me well so November 12th I'll be fighting Rashad
[02:09:41.940 --> 02:09:46.660]  Evans at Madison Square Gardens this fight has huge title implications he's a
[02:09:46.660 --> 02:09:52.660]  former light heavyweight champion moving down to 185 for the first time and the
[02:09:52.660 --> 02:09:55.580]  current champion Michael Bisping the last time that we fought I beat the
[02:09:55.580 --> 02:09:57.940]  brakes off him for 25 minutes there's one of those fights where I could have
[02:09:57.940 --> 02:10:00.180]  knocked him out could have submitted him but he had disrespected one of my
[02:10:00.180 --> 02:10:03.660]  friends and he spat on one of my friends so instead of just submitting and
[02:10:03.660 --> 02:10:06.860]  we're knocking him out I just humiliated him for 25 minutes that's the current
[02:10:06.860 --> 02:10:10.380]  champion so when I beat Rashad Evans they are gonna have one they're gonna have
[02:10:10.380 --> 02:10:14.580]  one choice they gotta let me fight the champ so what I got right here this is
[02:10:14.580 --> 02:10:18.460]  my bout agreement this is this is the agreement from the UFC for me to fight

[02:11:12.820 --> 02:11:15.380]  doing I'm fighting cuz I want to fight and I'm looking forward to fighting at
[02:11:15.380 --> 02:11:20.420]  Madison Square Gardens the first fight in UFC history in the state of New York

[02:11:30.460 --> 02:11:33.340]  you to fight for years you can talk about why that hasn't happened yet but I
[02:11:33.340 --> 02:11:36.940]  mean tell them you're coming for him right there on camera for November 12th
[02:11:36.940 --> 02:11:41.500]  fighting Rashad Evans in New York at Madison Square Gardens I'm coming to
[02:11:41.500 --> 02:11:45.260]  not only win but to dominate I need to make an exclamation mark to the entire
[02:11:45.260 --> 02:11:50.700]  division that I have been and I still am the best fighter in that division and
[02:11:50.700 --> 02:11:53.780]  there's gonna be no question that my next fight after Rashad is for the
[02:11:53.780 --> 02:11:59.260]  middleweight title and for those that have been living in a cave you might go
[02:11:59.260 --> 02:12:02.540]  back to the fact that you were totally dominating the last guy and then he
[02:12:02.540 --> 02:12:05.140]  wouldn't get out of the corner and then ran up it was just like something out of
[02:12:05.140 --> 02:12:08.620]  a movie it was so crooked you called him out for being on Roids and it later
[02:12:08.620 --> 02:12:13.980]  came out he was yeah it wasn't it wasn't a hard jump to a conclusion look you
[02:12:13.980 --> 02:12:17.940]  know how he how he's competed this was your Romero to end the UFC I'm all
[02:12:17.940 --> 02:12:22.420]  but undefeated with a very very controversial loss you know to do a
[02:12:22.420 --> 02:12:25.980]  guy that doesn't even deserve us talking about him you know moving forward the
[02:12:25.980 --> 02:12:30.300]  only thing I'm looking forward to is fighting Rashad Evans at Madison Square
[02:12:30.300 --> 02:12:33.420]  Gardens November 12th you know this is gonna be historic and it's gonna be a
[02:12:33.420 --> 02:12:38.540]  dominating fight for me you're a tough guy I mean let me tell you that man he
[02:12:38.540 --> 02:12:44.180]  he's no slouch this is gonna be a big fight yeah he's he's tough he's a he's
[02:12:44.180 --> 02:12:48.020]  well-rounded he was a collegiate wrestler he has powerful hands you know
[02:12:48.020 --> 02:12:50.260]  he's gonna sprawl and ball he doesn't want to he's not gonna want to engage
[02:12:50.260 --> 02:12:53.940]  with me he's gonna try to hit me from the outside you know which is fine fight
[02:12:53.940 --> 02:12:57.900]  camp I have a long fight camp leading up to this I've been training I'm in shape
[02:12:57.900 --> 02:13:00.380]  I have two months to get ready for the fight I'm gonna go to Albuquerque New

[02:13:04.220 --> 02:13:09.820]  Info Wars to film some of my fight camp you know when you're training you're
[02:13:09.820 --> 02:13:14.340]  training 90 minute sessions once twice three times a day you know I don't there's
[02:13:14.340 --> 02:13:17.340]  one day a week that I only have one workout all the other days are two or
[02:13:17.340 --> 02:13:22.180]  three times what you're gonna love I do like I mean that's almost normal for me
[02:13:22.180 --> 02:13:26.740]  you know but with those long workouts it's hard to keep the energy up it's hard
[02:13:26.740 --> 02:13:29.580]  well let's put the tweet up we just said 10 minutes before you came on air when
[02:13:29.580 --> 02:13:32.340]  you were actually you know getting in your suit out of your workout clothes I
[02:13:32.340 --> 02:13:35.700]  mean you look like you're in pretty much perfect shape right now you don't I
[02:13:35.700 --> 02:13:38.420]  mean you look like you have very low body fat how in the hell are you gonna
[02:13:38.420 --> 02:13:43.180]  lose all this weight yeah I got so where I'm at right now weight wise I have 25
[02:13:43.180 --> 02:13:49.620]  pounds to lose in the next eight weeks so I'm maybe seven eight percent body fat
[02:13:49.620 --> 02:13:54.660]  I need to lose another three four percent and 25 more pounds to make weight on
[02:13:54.660 --> 02:13:59.020]  November 12th you know I use I use Info Wars products you know I use
[02:13:59.020 --> 02:14:04.020]  super male male vitality when I am tired when I'm broken when I'm you know
[02:14:04.020 --> 02:14:07.940]  trying to get you know just go home and be intimate with my wife it's those
[02:14:07.940 --> 02:14:11.580]  things it's these supplements that kick me into the next gear so I can have
[02:14:11.580 --> 02:14:17.580]  another training session and you know have the energy and libido to keep things
[02:14:17.580 --> 02:14:20.500]  and by the way this was never planned I went to high school was changed down or
[02:14:20.500 --> 02:14:23.700]  who's a really good workout buddy of yours and you guys been training on three
[02:14:23.700 --> 02:14:26.540]  four years and then he just told me about the gym really loves his super
[02:14:26.540 --> 02:14:29.580]  mobile tally fact Shane first came here and really didn't like supplements then
[02:14:29.580 --> 02:14:32.300]  and made fun of me because I was still pretty much out of shape still am
[02:14:32.300 --> 02:14:35.660]  compared to you guys he's like oh yeah supplement male vitality we was a
[02:14:35.660 --> 02:14:38.780]  Superman he comes back like a month later he goes I want a whole case of that my
[02:14:38.780 --> 02:14:41.940]  dad once who's a world champion bull rider you know super good shape he's like
[02:14:41.940 --> 02:14:44.900]  you know 60 something years old you know looks like he's in you same tip as you
[02:14:44.900 --> 02:14:48.780]  and because it's cold pressed known herbs I didn't develop this the top
[02:14:48.780 --> 02:14:52.260]  herbologists you know Dr. Group in the country I mean a guy that like you know
[02:14:52.260 --> 02:14:55.340]  the Hollywood stars all use his stuff it's the best yeah it's like sold in
[02:14:55.340 --> 02:14:59.820]  medical clinics he let me basically private label his stuff that's sold at
[02:14:59.820 --> 02:15:03.620]  medical clinics and that's what it is it's cold pressed but it doesn't copy
[02:15:03.620 --> 02:15:07.300]  testosterone that's why you're able to take it and you were able to be tested
[02:15:07.300 --> 02:15:11.300]  and you know and become clean it only gets your body to release the hormones
[02:15:11.300 --> 02:15:15.620]  you already have and what I'm told is it actually blocks estrogen mimicers that
[02:15:15.620 --> 02:15:18.980]  are in all the plastics and crap so it brings you more to your natural state so
[02:15:18.980 --> 02:15:22.580]  here you are mr. clean I remember what Shane said yeah Tim really likes this
[02:15:22.580 --> 02:15:25.820]  fear is gone like oh yeah right he'll be a sponsor that guy doesn't take anything
[02:15:25.820 --> 02:15:29.620]  he's famous for them testing him and you know over and over and only drugs this
[02:15:29.620 --> 02:15:33.660]  is legal and lawful but he won't want to take it but but at the same time I mean
[02:15:33.660 --> 02:15:36.940]  it is natural it is normal and so I'm just honored that you are taking in
[02:15:36.940 --> 02:15:40.260]  because this is I mean this is crazy it's also good for info wars a lot of
[02:15:40.260 --> 02:15:43.020]  folks are getting the product because you've endorsed it I mean let's be
[02:15:43.020 --> 02:15:45.340]  honest that you said it was just a moderate response because you're already
[02:15:45.340 --> 02:15:49.140]  such a peak performance when you're really out of shape like I was everything
[02:15:49.140 --> 02:15:52.900]  else you really notice the difference but for me everybody says it's a bit the
[02:15:52.900 --> 02:15:58.140]  libido is the most obvious well yes absolutely you know you feel that I
[02:15:58.140 --> 02:16:01.420]  want to go home I want to be intimate I want to hang out with my wife or my
[02:16:01.420 --> 02:16:06.620]  girlfriend my boyfriend whatever it is so significant and it's so noticeable so
[02:16:06.620 --> 02:16:11.300]  even I just want the tiniest gain from where I was you know the United States
[02:16:11.300 --> 02:16:15.260]  athletic anti-doping agency comes and tests me all the time they test me when
[02:16:15.260 --> 02:16:17.820]  I'm on this a few months ago was like what four days in a row it was
[02:16:17.820 --> 02:16:21.180]  unbelievable which is totally fine you know like we dropped you dropped a video

[02:16:40.660 --> 02:16:44.100]  taking before workouts and after workout only natural totally natural to feel
[02:16:44.100 --> 02:16:47.940]  better and to be the most elite athlete on the planet by the way years ago you
[02:16:47.940 --> 02:16:51.340]  and Shane were going out and getting raw milk you were getting your vegetables
[02:16:51.340 --> 02:16:55.620]  from the Amish and people ask what your secret is you are out there getting the
[02:16:55.620 --> 02:16:58.980]  best raw food yeah I mean this is the video right now you know this is you

[02:17:02.540 --> 02:17:05.500]  kids and do it that's what it's all about is that the connection to your food
[02:17:05.500 --> 02:17:11.460]  the connection to you know life and the hard work and actually getting that
[02:17:11.460 --> 02:17:15.060]  benefit from being connected to what's being put into I was about to say doesn't
[02:17:15.060 --> 02:17:17.580]  something in your brain click when you're digging in the mud planting stuff
[02:17:17.580 --> 02:17:20.980]  so and then you get to eat that you know and you remember a kid and you're
[02:17:20.980 --> 02:17:23.620]  working so hard to build that that erectus let's see you I mean you come from
[02:17:23.620 --> 02:17:26.860]  family of farmers so that's why you're already got it so well thank God you know
[02:17:26.860 --> 02:17:29.860]  and now I just want to pass that on to other people so they can understand and
[02:17:29.860 --> 02:17:33.300]  get connected you know if you're hurt if you're overweight if you have injuries
[02:17:33.300 --> 02:17:36.940]  if you're an athlete and you want to take it to the next level start looking at
[02:17:36.940 --> 02:17:40.620]  what you're putting into your body you know right now we have a huge sale on
[02:17:40.620 --> 02:17:44.020]  enforce it's 20% off for the Supermail Vitality and it's because the
[02:17:44.020 --> 02:17:47.620]  announcement of this fight right here and me getting ready to fight Rashad
[02:17:47.620 --> 02:17:51.900]  Evans at Madison Square Gardens you know go by the product I believe in it it
[02:17:51.900 --> 02:17:54.460]  is it's a real deal I mean look at me I mean I'm no
[02:17:54.460 --> 02:17:58.900]  ticketing but but but 70 pounds I've lost taking Supermail and the X2 and
[02:17:58.900 --> 02:18:03.220]  other products I mean it's amazing and this stuff really works it does you
[02:18:03.220 --> 02:18:07.260]  feel it you notice it and I'm still getting faster I'm still getting stronger
[02:18:07.260 --> 02:18:11.580]  you know I'm still getting becoming harder to kill every day it's just being
[02:18:11.580 --> 02:18:15.460]  and refining that even though you are like at the top of the Al Qaeda and I
[02:18:15.460 --> 02:18:18.860]  just kill this gotta hope so I mean I need to kick it up a notch you know like
[02:18:18.860 --> 02:18:22.180]  obviously Al Qaeda you know they said they're gonna kill the creators of
[02:18:22.180 --> 02:18:25.180]  South Park because they made fun of the Prophet Muhammad and they said they're
[02:18:25.180 --> 02:18:29.580]  gonna come kill me we're all still alive so maybe maybe I just need to get on the
[02:18:29.580 --> 02:18:35.340]  Clinton hit list because they don't have some I'm actually on that one I'm
[02:18:35.340 --> 02:18:37.940]  on their enemies list I know that we're gonna skip this network break by the way
[02:18:37.940 --> 02:18:41.100]  do we have Tim Kennedy tackling me the other day because I want to pull this
[02:18:41.100 --> 02:18:44.420]  up because this actually happened I noticed Shane was filming and Tim was
[02:18:44.420 --> 02:18:48.260]  already tackling people and vice versa and then I knew it wasn't even stage I
[02:18:48.260 --> 02:18:51.620]  just knew I saw Shane with the camera on me and I said I love Hillary Clinton
[02:18:51.620 --> 02:18:54.860]  and then you know knowing that Tim would tackle me I'm gonna be honest this is
[02:18:54.860 --> 02:19:00.540]  actually true you tackled me and that part didn't hurt but your hair like a
[02:19:00.540 --> 02:19:05.380]  whip actually slapped me you hit me so hard just with a hair pal that it actually
[02:19:05.380 --> 02:19:08.540]  was like a bullwhip or something let's play that clip for TV viewers all and
[02:19:08.540 --> 02:19:13.100]  then we haven't told the story yet the rotten fish story do not tell this guy
[02:19:13.100 --> 02:19:16.740]  to go do something he'll do it was this giant rotting striper in fact Shane
[02:19:16.740 --> 02:19:20.020]  actually tweeted where you come up out of the water people think was live I go
[02:19:20.020 --> 02:19:24.100]  hey look at that big dead fish go get it by the damn he goes over gets it all
[02:19:24.100 --> 02:19:28.340]  these guts are coming out I jump in the water and it gets in my face this guy's
[02:19:28.340 --> 02:19:31.580]  not puking I start puking so that is some training dude because let me tell
[02:19:31.580 --> 02:19:35.260]  you something wait I was bomb or stupidity well no no you didn't throw up
[02:19:35.260 --> 02:19:38.340]  with guts all over you what the hell's going on here there's something wrong
[02:19:38.340 --> 02:19:41.020]  with my brain obviously because a normal person will be like oh I'm covered in
[02:19:41.020 --> 02:19:46.220]  rotten fish guts you know get me out of here they're gonna love this online but
[02:19:46.220 --> 02:19:50.260]  it's true story let's play the club of Tim tackling me here it is I like Hillary
[02:19:50.260 --> 02:19:53.620]  Clinton you know that's where I support so Tim Kennedy I'm a sport Hillary
[02:19:53.620 --> 02:19:55.620]  Clinton
[02:20:00.700 --> 02:20:04.300]  and then five minutes later he discovers the fish okay getting serious though
[02:20:04.300 --> 02:20:07.980]  let's get back into this fight because a lot of times these guys talk trash you
[02:20:07.980 --> 02:20:12.340]  talk trash back you were undefeated until this case you don't want to go back
[02:20:12.340 --> 02:20:16.580]  into but I mean I'm watching it's like out of a movie where we won't get up I
[02:20:16.580 --> 02:20:21.420]  mean I'm a ledge in my seat I'm I'm gonna go to this fight Madison Square
[02:20:21.420 --> 02:20:25.580]  Gardens a great venue last time I was there for the RNC 2004 it's historic
[02:20:25.580 --> 02:20:28.820]  you're my buddy but I mean they're saying now this is like the most anticipated
[02:20:28.820 --> 02:20:32.100]  fight ever we're not just hyping this because you haven't fought for several
[02:20:32.100 --> 02:20:36.940]  years why is that priorities you know I like fighting I enjoy fighting it's a
[02:20:36.940 --> 02:20:41.220]  sport it's a hobby to me but where this country is at and where it's been for the
[02:20:41.220 --> 02:20:44.900]  past two three years actually for the past eight years has been down a road
[02:20:44.900 --> 02:20:49.980]  that if we continue down we won't have the America that I love any longer so I
[02:20:49.980 --> 02:20:54.740]  committed to myself and into my family to my friends two years ago that I was
[02:20:54.740 --> 02:20:59.340]  going to start doing things to affect change to improve our country to improve
[02:20:59.340 --> 02:21:03.940]  you know even just on a micro level that the people around me law enforcement
[02:21:03.940 --> 02:21:07.780]  community military so I started companies and start training law
[02:21:07.780 --> 02:21:10.180]  enforcement guys you know these shootings that are happening over and over
[02:21:10.180 --> 02:21:15.700]  and over again that cops are getting a really bad rap for it really comes down
[02:21:15.700 --> 02:21:19.900]  to their training so that's what I've been doing for the past two years I have
[02:21:19.900 --> 02:21:23.620]  been working non-stop but I love the fact you're like you know like the farmer
[02:21:23.620 --> 02:21:27.260]  warrior are you like George Washington going back to the farm you don't care
[02:21:27.260 --> 02:21:30.140]  about the glitch the glamour the fighting is only a way to I guess be more
[02:21:30.140 --> 02:21:33.340]  famous to be able to promote liberty and freedom that's your real passion and
[02:21:33.340 --> 02:21:36.740]  I've seen that but if you but if you win this fight obviously and then win the
[02:21:36.740 --> 02:21:41.460]  heavyweight or the championship in this then obviously your platform will be
[02:21:41.460 --> 02:21:45.300]  even bigger to promote liberty so I hope that if I know in between your fight
[02:21:45.300 --> 02:21:48.700]  training you're going and training police and going and doing missions and
[02:21:48.700 --> 02:21:53.180]  doing other classified stuff I mean I hope you can just not do all the secret
[02:21:53.180 --> 02:21:56.100]  stuff and the police training while you're training I mean I think you
[02:21:56.100 --> 02:21:59.340]  really need to focus on the fight now I'm committed to this fight I realized
[02:21:59.340 --> 02:22:02.580]  that the ramifications the implications and the opportunity that's gonna be
[02:22:02.580 --> 02:22:06.020]  forwarded to me when I have that championship you know when I right
[02:22:06.020 --> 02:22:08.980]  now I'm a top 10 fighter I'm a special forces guy I'm a you know Green Bray a
[02:22:08.980 --> 02:22:13.700]  sniper a ranger so people listen to what I say but when I have a huge gold belt
[02:22:13.700 --> 02:22:17.540]  around my waist at waist and I'm the champion of the world and I'm all those
[02:22:17.540 --> 02:22:21.780]  other things and I say believe in freedom believe in dangerous freedom give
[02:22:21.780 --> 02:22:25.180]  freedom a chance understand what individual responsibility means you
[02:22:25.180 --> 02:22:28.540]  know have faith in your law enforcement give them the tools they need given the
[02:22:28.540 --> 02:22:32.940]  training that they need it will have such a more powerful voice it'll be next
[02:22:32.940 --> 02:22:35.820]  level and that's what I need that that is the only reason that I'm doing this I
[02:22:35.820 --> 02:22:39.500]  don't honestly I win this title I might even just leave it on the octagon floor
[02:22:39.500 --> 02:22:42.420]  because I don't need it I don't want it exactly I mean truthfully you're doing
[02:22:42.420 --> 02:22:44.940]  some really important stuff behind the scenes your wife's sick of it I know I
[02:22:44.940 --> 02:22:49.860]  mean yeah I there are way more important things in fighting but right now it's
[02:22:49.860 --> 02:22:52.860]  going to give me the opportunity to give back to the communities that I believe
[02:22:52.860 --> 02:22:56.820]  in and to pour and use that platform to you well I just appreciate you you're so
[02:22:56.820 --> 02:22:59.780]  classy we didn't even I know you have these huge platforms ESPN you name it
[02:22:59.780 --> 02:23:03.540]  would love to have you come announce this interview you gave it to us like
[02:23:03.540 --> 02:23:06.220]  last week they said Tim Kennedy's you know don't say it Alex but this is who
[02:23:06.220 --> 02:23:09.300]  he's fighting and he expects the guy to say it the day before but he'll do it you
[02:23:09.300 --> 02:23:12.880]  know that day the way he's supposed to and Tim was coming on the show like wow
[02:23:12.880 --> 02:23:16.780]  that's a big deal because this will be all over the news now and and so it
[02:23:16.780 --> 02:23:20.820]  really is tied to your message of liberty you announce it here why I mean
[02:23:20.820 --> 02:23:24.780]  you're two minutes to the viewers to the folks out there I mean we're telling
[02:23:24.780 --> 02:23:27.580]  the mainstream media this is why Tim Kennedy's doing this it's wise fighting
[02:23:27.580 --> 02:23:30.540]  to promote liberty this is his view of the world this is wise concern Tim
[02:23:30.540 --> 02:23:35.620]  Kennedy I want every opportunity I'm gonna use any platform I can to you know
[02:23:35.620 --> 02:23:38.700]  perpetuate the things that Alex talks about the things that you know that I
[02:23:38.700 --> 02:23:43.500]  believe in about freedom and so if it's using to you know announce my next
[02:23:43.500 --> 02:23:46.740]  fight and that's in square gardens on air so that people come here and click
[02:23:46.740 --> 02:23:50.220]  on this instead they bring them here to info wars it's so they come and listen
[02:23:50.220 --> 02:23:53.460]  what Alex has to say this is they learn and their mind gets expanded and they
[02:23:53.460 --> 02:23:57.740]  they open up their ears for me the first time and look at where we are as a
[02:23:57.740 --> 02:24:03.060]  nation and how much trouble we're in you know not to fear longer but if we keep
[02:24:03.060 --> 02:24:06.900]  going down the road that we've been on for the past eight years we will not have
[02:24:06.900 --> 02:24:12.380]  the country that I love that I bled for that I watched friends die fighting for
[02:24:12.380 --> 02:24:16.420]  that I fought for that I killed for that that country won't exist any longer we
[02:24:16.420 --> 02:24:21.900]  have to change where we're going right now why do you think cuz I don't think
[02:24:21.900 --> 02:24:25.500]  it's debatable if you disagree tell me that Hillary Obama these globalists they
[02:24:25.500 --> 02:24:28.620]  want to mount America's head on the wall it's like we're a trophy America gave
[02:24:28.620 --> 02:24:32.780]  them all this power but they want to piss on the free market and the freedoms
[02:24:32.780 --> 02:24:36.980]  that that made the company so great I just don't get why they're in control why
[02:24:36.980 --> 02:24:40.580]  do they want to make everybody poor why do they want to have total control I
[02:24:40.580 --> 02:24:44.820]  just don't get it they can't control individual responsibility you know that
[02:24:44.820 --> 02:24:50.020]  the self-sustaining farming being in shape it's it is being self-supporting
[02:24:50.020 --> 02:24:53.980]  you know you can control somebody that's that's poor that's hungry that needs a
[02:24:53.980 --> 02:24:58.780]  phone that needs a check so they can go get food you can control those lemmings
[02:24:58.780 --> 02:25:02.780]  you can control that mass you know but the deplorables the things that they
[02:25:02.780 --> 02:25:06.180]  call us the things they call Alex the things they call me like those are
[02:25:06.180 --> 02:25:09.460]  people that they can't control and they hate us for that they hate that we that
[02:25:09.460 --> 02:25:12.900]  they can't say something and we have to do it they they hate that I can go get
[02:25:12.900 --> 02:25:16.780]  my medical care outside of the government they hate that I can go get my
[02:25:16.780 --> 02:25:20.140]  food and they don't provide it they hate that I can go to a well and I can
[02:25:20.140 --> 02:25:24.140]  that I can pull water up and they don't own it they hate everything about me
[02:25:24.140 --> 02:25:30.380]  about you and about our way of life which is freedom they hate independent
[02:25:30.380 --> 02:25:35.340]  organic humans they want domesticated slaves that will believe any amount of
[02:25:35.340 --> 02:25:40.220]  bull Hillary puts out looking at Hillary and and and last week they they were
[02:25:40.220 --> 02:25:45.740]  attacking us on ABC NBC NBC MSNBC Jones is insane she doesn't have epilepsy and
[02:25:45.740 --> 02:25:49.260]  it's like God did it at 9-11 when she's been working with Al Qaeda and ISIS all
[02:25:49.260 --> 02:25:53.580]  these years Bill Clinton you know blocked the army killing you know been
[02:25:53.580 --> 02:25:57.660]  allotted in 1999 that's been declassified at ground zero it's like biblical she
[02:25:57.660 --> 02:26:03.660]  collapses with that we with a seizure and it just proves everything we're saying
[02:26:03.660 --> 02:26:08.460]  and it's like everything we're doing all the sudden is like just gold everything
[02:26:08.460 --> 02:26:14.260]  they're doing is crap it seems like the that that spiritually these people are
[02:26:14.260 --> 02:26:20.500]  fair game you am I saying it's karma but you you reap what you sell you know and
[02:26:20.500 --> 02:26:24.100]  when you've been lying non-stop at every opportunity at every single juncture
[02:26:24.100 --> 02:26:29.580]  no it wasn't just that she was at 9-11 on you know at at ground zero and Ozzie it
[02:26:29.580 --> 02:26:33.060]  was I believe it seriously had to do with Benghazi all of my friends that were
[02:26:33.060 --> 02:26:35.980]  there they were dying that were fighting they were struggling for their
[02:26:35.980 --> 02:26:38.860]  existence people are picking up phones calling back to the secretary of state
[02:26:38.860 --> 02:26:42.660]  saying send us troops send us special forces send us the army rangers send us
[02:26:42.660 --> 02:26:45.780]  anybody they were on the plane ready to go they are ready to go and they
[02:26:45.780 --> 02:26:48.820]  couldn't take off there's only a couple people that have the authority and the
[02:26:48.820 --> 02:26:52.740]  power to say no and she's one of them so there's they got the stand on order
[02:26:52.740 --> 02:26:58.340]  but it's falling collapsing you know it's ironies tough you know carmas of
[02:26:58.340 --> 02:27:04.020]  itch she collapsed like the World Trade Centers it's tragic but where do you
[02:27:04.020 --> 02:27:06.740]  think this is going I don't think the people that run her the Saudi Arabians
[02:27:06.740 --> 02:27:09.900]  the Chinese I mean I've talked to former deputy directors the CIA and people
[02:27:09.900 --> 02:27:13.820]  that say no we know she is a Chinese agent and it when now we have her I
[02:27:13.820 --> 02:27:17.620]  was told this before it even came on the emails that she's working for the
[02:27:17.620 --> 02:27:20.660]  Chinese president I mean if you are out of this we should be arrested instantly
[02:27:20.660 --> 02:27:25.300]  and we should I mean she thought she'd be so corrupt that they wouldn't want to
[02:27:25.300 --> 02:27:27.620]  bring her down because we bring the whole government down well you know what
[02:27:27.620 --> 02:27:31.820]  justice be done may the heavens fall how do you think they're gonna try to strike
[02:27:31.820 --> 02:27:38.060]  back Tim Kennedy you know Bill and Hillary have never had a real job in
[02:27:38.060 --> 02:27:42.980]  their life they've been public servants their entire adult life and they're
[02:27:42.980 --> 02:27:48.340]  worth two to 300 million dollars that we know of yeah I mean it could be even
[02:27:48.340 --> 02:27:54.380]  half a billion if not more all of that money came from where foreign governments
[02:27:54.380 --> 02:28:00.180]  they were paying her while she was Secretary of State Russia China so now
[02:28:00.180 --> 02:28:05.180]  now what do you do you know they're their their secret agent though the woman
[02:28:05.180 --> 02:28:10.900]  that they planned on being president is now collapsing downtown New York at
[02:28:10.900 --> 02:28:15.300]  ground zero on 9-11 no they're gonna be at a loss they're gonna it is gonna get
[02:28:15.300 --> 02:28:23.740]  really ugly in the next seven weeks ugly well I gotta tell you the military is
[02:28:23.740 --> 02:28:28.500]  completely awake the police are awake and and they're not perfect but they're
[02:28:28.500 --> 02:28:32.580]  America and Hillary represents Soros and the globalist and the globalists think
[02:28:32.580 --> 02:28:36.100]  that they're in the same ball game they were just a few years ago they're not
[02:28:36.100 --> 02:28:39.980]  they're now the lights are on the roaches don't understand it's like we
[02:28:39.980 --> 02:28:43.500]  have night vision on the roaches only we see them I don't think they understand
[02:28:43.500 --> 02:28:46.580]  I've always been a pessimist but I'm being honest here and I've even had
[02:28:46.580 --> 02:28:50.660]  Roger Stone on as a big pessimist he says no no we are running the tables on
[02:28:50.660 --> 02:28:56.660]  them right now they are sinking fast last week as in Dallas training law
[02:28:56.660 --> 02:28:59.060]  enforcement officers you know what our crew was there it's coming out next
[02:28:59.060 --> 02:29:02.220]  week it's incredible is the video that you guys are gonna 105 degrees at 10
[02:29:02.220 --> 02:29:07.140]  hours a day in body armor these these police officers trained for 16 hours a
[02:29:07.140 --> 02:29:13.140]  day with strangers UFC fighters some of the best shooters on the planet learning
[02:29:13.140 --> 02:29:16.180]  there they're dedicating their time their own time they weren't being paid to
[02:29:16.180 --> 02:29:19.220]  be there to be better as police officer and I should have said 16 I know I
[02:29:19.220 --> 02:29:21.620]  noticed it's like early morning and then late at night you guys are shooting
[02:29:21.620 --> 02:29:26.980]  yeah we started at 6 to 7 a.m. and then we would work all the way till 10 11 12
[02:29:26.980 --> 02:29:31.700]  p.m. a.m. the next next day these police officers were remarkable but do what
[02:29:31.700 --> 02:29:36.380]  they were like you said their minds were open they understood what it was
[02:29:36.380 --> 02:29:39.060]  happening nationally they knew the shootings in Baton Rouge they're
[02:29:39.060 --> 02:29:42.460]  connected to San Bernardino shooters they understood what happened Orlando they
[02:29:42.460 --> 02:29:46.460]  knew what was let's talk about that and play the urban farming video that is so
[02:29:46.460 --> 02:29:49.940]  key not just to grow your food it consciously opens you up folks it's
[02:29:49.940 --> 02:29:56.460]  spiritual on the back the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[02:29:56.460 --> 02:30:03.780]  network and recently released emails a column pals correspondence with a
[02:30:03.780 --> 02:30:07.260]  Democrat donor pal gives the most succinct and accurate description ever
[02:30:07.260 --> 02:30:11.060]  of Hillary Clinton saying she's a 70-year-old person with a long track
[02:30:11.060 --> 02:30:16.980]  record unbridled ambition greedy but it gets even better he said I'd rather not
[02:30:16.980 --> 02:30:22.860]  have to vote for her although she is a friend I respect respect no he'll vote
[02:30:22.860 --> 02:30:26.940]  for her because she's part of the club like the establishment elitists of
[02:30:26.940 --> 02:30:31.900]  Bohemian Grove whom Powell said in another email absolutely hate Trump most
[02:30:31.900 --> 02:30:35.180]  of those of Bohemian Grove he said will vote against him but quite a few will
[02:30:35.180 --> 02:30:38.940]  not vote for Hillary and will vote for a third-party candidate so while elitists
[02:30:38.940 --> 02:30:42.260]  gather in Bohemian Grove for as the Washington Post describes it heavy
[02:30:42.260 --> 02:30:46.540]  drinking super secret talks druid worship and other rituals you know like
[02:30:46.540 --> 02:30:51.820]  mock child sacrifices to Malik those people the Satan worshipping pedophiles
[02:30:51.820 --> 02:30:56.420]  won't be voting for Trump but they're just fine with Hillary and Gary Johnson

[02:33:15.500 --> 02:33:36.620]  alex jones on the GCN radio network a lot of military people tell me that when
[02:33:36.620 --> 02:33:39.220]  they're going in on a mission on helicopters they listen to the song
[02:33:39.220 --> 02:33:47.900]  Ted Nugent and Stranglehold have you ever heard that? Nugent that guy is he's a
[02:33:47.900 --> 02:33:54.940]  fire-breathing American he said last week a bunch of coffins on C7 coming
[02:33:54.940 --> 02:33:58.260]  back he's like hey you all you people that are taking a knee during the
[02:33:58.260 --> 02:34:03.580]  national anthem can you point to which coffin with the American flag draped over
[02:34:03.580 --> 02:34:07.260]  it it is the black or white American that you're protesting for you know that
[02:34:07.260 --> 02:34:11.060]  net Nugent said that last week and just like struck home with me I'd goose bumps
[02:34:11.060 --> 02:34:15.620]  you know he's uh he's fire-breathing that's how you described it Ted Nugent
[02:34:15.620 --> 02:34:20.940]  is a fire-breathing American can we tweet Tim Kennedy Ted Nugent is a fire
[02:34:20.940 --> 02:34:25.340]  breathing American he is I never want to be I will never be on the the wrong side
[02:34:25.340 --> 02:34:30.140]  of him because he and I are aligned in about 67% of things that he says but I
[02:34:30.140 --> 02:34:34.340]  don't ever want to be on the receiving end of pissing off Ted Nugent which would
[02:34:34.340 --> 02:34:37.620]  involve like pissing on your country so I'm never gonna be on that end well I mean
[02:34:37.620 --> 02:34:41.700]  look I don't want to put down these stupid NFL players but what they're
[02:34:41.700 --> 02:34:45.460]  making hundreds of millions of dollars a year one guys it makes like ten million
[02:34:45.460 --> 02:34:48.140]  dollars in sponsorship year a hundred and fourteen million dollar contract twelve
[02:34:48.140 --> 02:34:52.060]  million dollar signing bonus and then he's he's got white parents that
[02:34:52.060 --> 02:34:55.300]  adopted him and he's running around saying white people are basically the
[02:34:55.300 --> 02:35:00.140]  devil and then bitching and then like 9-11 I mean I could see okay I'm not
[02:35:00.140 --> 02:35:02.620]  gonna do this you know the pledge of allegiance I can make me do anything I
[02:35:02.620 --> 02:35:06.660]  mean I don't agree with that I could see that but what about on 9-11 I'm gonna
[02:35:06.660 --> 02:35:10.620]  take a knee no matter what you think happened on 9-11 we know criminals our
[02:35:10.620 --> 02:35:13.940]  government work with radical Islamists to basically to carry that out stood down
[02:35:13.940 --> 02:35:19.140]  the point is how do you blame the police and the firefighters and the people
[02:35:19.140 --> 02:35:22.980]  that died in the heroes what the hell is your damn problem it's like the
[02:35:22.980 --> 02:35:29.060]  ultimate level of a baby yeah it was it was pathetic it was it was disingenuous
[02:35:29.060 --> 02:35:32.860]  it was everything that you're not supposed to be on 9-11 it was shameful
[02:35:32.860 --> 02:35:36.180]  I mean these people are embarrassed you know there's gonna there's already five
[02:35:36.180 --> 02:35:39.340]  teams I'm never gonna walk I love football I love you know everything about
[02:35:39.340 --> 02:35:44.420]  America I love it you know like barbecue bourbon motorcycle football too but
[02:35:44.420 --> 02:35:47.460]  watching these punks I know well there's five teams I'm not gonna watch you know
[02:35:47.460 --> 02:35:53.100]  and all of them had guys on their knees during the national anthem on 9-11 that's
[02:35:53.100 --> 02:35:57.460]  it but what is the point I know it's all Soros fun and they now admit this was
[02:35:57.460 --> 02:36:01.260]  all manipulated but what are the Democrats thinking like like that sounds
[02:36:01.260 --> 02:36:06.460]  like the worst PR move ever to go I don't understand I'm making a hundred
[02:36:06.460 --> 02:36:12.020]  million dollars America's horrible evil white people adopted me they're so bad
[02:36:12.020 --> 02:36:15.700]  I mean what the hell is your problem don't don't take a knee go effect change

[02:36:32.980 --> 02:36:37.940]  police force and be the connection between the the disenchanted disenfranchised
[02:36:37.940 --> 02:36:41.700]  community that apparently you're trying to represent go dedicate your time to
[02:36:41.700 --> 02:36:45.820]  those people that you think you're serving okay then you'll get my respect
[02:36:45.820 --> 02:36:48.940]  then you maybe I was about to say say what you want about the cops the cops
[02:36:48.940 --> 02:36:52.820]  that work in these inner cities that that job you could pay me $500,000 to do
[02:36:52.820 --> 02:36:58.580]  that yeah that is a crap then that is a bad job that's dangerous $500,000 you
[02:36:58.580 --> 02:37:04.260]  that the police officers that are there 40,000 not is maybe they do it because
[02:37:04.260 --> 02:37:07.700]  they believe in helping the community you know what I love though Obama and
[02:37:07.700 --> 02:37:10.700]  Soros trying to break the will of our local governments and our local people
[02:37:10.700 --> 02:37:14.660]  it backfired they didn't just give up and roll over the Justice Department the
[02:37:14.660 --> 02:37:18.540]  UN takeover under strong cities they actually completely woke up that's what
[02:37:18.540 --> 02:37:23.820]  I'm saying there's blind spots with Hillary's people what they did drove the
[02:37:23.820 --> 02:37:28.260]  what was left of the police that weren't awake right into reality yeah I mean no
[02:37:28.260 --> 02:37:31.820]  question in fact the break hit we can show some b-roll for TV viewers info
[02:37:31.820 --> 02:37:35.100]  wars.com forward slash show of your radio listener info wars.com forward slash
[02:37:35.100 --> 02:37:38.140]  show we're giving a sneak peek that's coming out next week super powerful
[02:37:38.140 --> 02:37:41.540]  three days you guys like four or five my crew covered for three hundred plus
[02:37:41.540 --> 02:37:46.060]  degrees out there 16 hour days you were talking about how awake the police are
[02:37:46.060 --> 02:37:51.020]  and again I never even made the police like the heroes it's that now as things
[02:37:51.020 --> 02:37:56.500]  get really bad in America they're more awake than anybody so then I it's
[02:37:56.500 --> 02:38:01.780]  actually exciting. The police haven't changed they are still the amazing top
[02:38:01.780 --> 02:38:04.980]  I mean they're the they're the best Americans that there are they have been
[02:38:04.980 --> 02:38:08.380]  volunteering their time and committing themselves to serving the public that
[02:38:08.380 --> 02:38:13.300]  they swore to protect it is just the media that has been demonizing them it's
[02:38:13.300 --> 02:38:16.500]  been the attack non-stop from the left that these guys are doing the wrong
[02:38:16.500 --> 02:38:20.540]  thing they're not they they have tried time and time again to do the right
[02:38:20.540 --> 02:38:25.020]  thing and this those those these police officers that came to this course work
[02:38:25.020 --> 02:38:29.580]  in 16 hour days on their own time using their own money you know this is at
[02:38:29.580 --> 02:38:33.100]  sheepdog response those are all my instructors they're there on their own
[02:38:33.100 --> 02:38:37.740]  will at their own time on their own money I was so humbled to see the
[02:38:37.740 --> 02:38:41.940]  commitment by these police officers trying to better themselves so they could
[02:38:41.940 --> 02:38:46.420]  do one thing serve their community better that's all they want they don't
[02:38:46.420 --> 02:38:50.660]  make money they don't have money all they want to do is serve the community
[02:38:50.660 --> 02:38:53.700]  that they swore to protect protect and serve that's what they're there for and
[02:38:53.700 --> 02:38:58.140]  they are trying their hardest their damnedest to be the best versions of
[02:38:58.140 --> 02:39:02.220]  themselves so they can help learning how to fight learning new rest and control
[02:39:02.220 --> 02:39:05.340]  you know if you know how to fight if you know how to put on cuffs maybe you
[02:39:05.340 --> 02:39:07.620]  don't have to shoot that guy so they're trying to get better at it you know if
[02:39:07.620 --> 02:39:11.340]  you know how to shoot somebody maybe you know and the statistics show you're
[02:39:11.340 --> 02:39:15.460]  twice as likely to get shot not even in population wise but actual per person if
[02:39:15.460 --> 02:39:19.180]  you're white than if you're black what sad is the cops won't respond now so
[02:39:19.180 --> 02:39:22.860]  record numbers of black Americans are getting killed yeah I think you know
[02:39:22.860 --> 02:39:28.060]  another good statistic is you're really really increasing your chance of getting
[02:39:28.060 --> 02:39:33.420]  shot by the police if you're breaking the law so stop doing that don't break the
[02:39:33.420 --> 02:39:37.380]  law and then do what the police tell you to you know if I get pulled over my hands
[02:39:37.380 --> 02:39:40.500]  are on the steering wheel and I'm like yes sir no sir whatever you want I'm one
[02:39:40.500 --> 02:39:44.300]  of the baddest dudes on the planet and I'm I'm not risking anything and you know
[02:39:44.300 --> 02:39:47.300]  what they're gonna they're gonna do exactly what they're gonna do and it's
[02:39:47.300 --> 02:39:49.860]  gonna be safe and they're gonna serve and protect the community like they swore
[02:39:49.860 --> 02:39:54.460]  to don't be a jerk well there's obviously in this country bad people in
[02:39:54.460 --> 02:39:58.220]  every profession but the point is when foreign globalist bet all their money
[02:39:58.220 --> 02:40:02.140]  and hundreds of millions of dollars on a civil war based on going after police
[02:40:02.140 --> 02:40:06.660]  that's exactly what Soros did in Ukraine three years ago a civil war against
[02:40:06.660 --> 02:40:09.500]  police brutality they overthrew the elected government now the country's
[02:40:09.500 --> 02:40:15.220]  in shambles this is an attempt to cause a civil war okay people so there's no
[02:40:15.220 --> 02:40:20.980]  doubt the race beating was to such a degree it was pathetic you know you
[02:40:20.980 --> 02:40:25.580]  when you look at Baltimore you know in Milwaukee and Chicago and you look at how
[02:40:25.580 --> 02:40:31.020]  that the media was playing oh another guy was shot like oh dang it it was by an
[02:40:31.020 --> 02:40:36.100]  African-American police officer who was on his back while the felon who had just
[02:40:36.100 --> 02:40:39.780]  broken the law which was his third felony two of which were violence against
[02:40:39.780 --> 02:40:42.540]  crime thing I don't we don't know what to do they just kept on trapping
[02:40:42.540 --> 02:40:47.020]  themselves in every single juncture in every single corner because these guys
[02:40:47.020 --> 02:40:51.020]  are good yeah nobody's perfect they're still humans the police officers try
[02:40:51.020 --> 02:40:54.380]  their hardest to make the best choice well look I mean there are obviously bad
[02:40:54.380 --> 02:40:57.660]  cops but and it's and it's fondest that they're gonna attack him and go after
[02:40:57.660 --> 02:41:01.500]  him but the point is statistically a thousand people a year get shot by cops
[02:41:01.500 --> 02:41:06.140]  maybe you say a hundred are unjustified a hundred people out of 330 something
[02:41:06.140 --> 02:41:09.940]  million and we got TB killing hundreds of people a month now they they're just
[02:41:09.940 --> 02:41:13.180]  letting in we've gotten hundreds of thousands dying in car wrecks we've
[02:41:13.180 --> 02:41:16.140]  got illegal aliens killing tens of thousands a year no one cares about
[02:41:16.140 --> 02:41:20.460]  that it's all about saying your police are bad and that's because they want to
[02:41:20.460 --> 02:41:24.740]  bring in federal control global control they admit and federalize them and turn
[02:41:24.740 --> 02:41:27.980]  the police you think the police got problems now folks they want to turn the
[02:41:27.980 --> 02:41:31.780]  police into globalist officers look what the Department of Justice did in
[02:41:31.780 --> 02:41:36.540]  every single opportunity whether it was Albuquerque or Milwaukee they look for
[02:41:36.540 --> 02:41:42.980]  every chance to bring in federal law enforcement they want federal law
[02:41:42.980 --> 02:41:46.060]  enforcement everywhere they don't stop in the midst of the plan they don't want
[02:41:46.060 --> 02:41:50.100]  local control local control means independence that was the basis of the
[02:41:50.100 --> 02:41:54.140]  Constitution was affording us independence to do whatever we think is
[02:41:54.140 --> 02:41:57.300]  right they don't want that freedom they don't like dangerous freedom they like
[02:41:57.300 --> 02:42:00.940]  control control it might as well just be Russia might as well be China why is
[02:42:00.940 --> 02:42:04.020]  what might well be North Korea when you have the federal government that is
[02:42:04.020 --> 02:42:07.700]  taking care of the elections that is coming in every time there's a shooting
[02:42:07.700 --> 02:42:13.180]  and making it a righteous or an unrighteous shooting we have problems
[02:42:13.180 --> 02:42:16.980]  we need to head this off and recognize that the law enforcement community at
[02:42:16.980 --> 02:42:20.740]  the local level is doing the right thing as best as they can and there's an
[02:42:20.740 --> 02:42:24.060]  attempt to federalize them that's the demonization campaign period no federal
[02:42:24.060 --> 02:42:28.860]  government and the law enforcement is the worst idea you can ever have well
[02:42:28.860 --> 02:42:33.860]  look at the FBI they won't even give Congress the 302 forms from Hillary they
[02:42:33.860 --> 02:42:42.060]  told Congress you do a foyer now I want to shift gears back to Rashid Evans you
[02:42:42.060 --> 02:42:46.860]  seem very very confident he's obviously a serious ombre let's talk about the
[02:42:46.860 --> 02:42:51.140]  fight a little bit more than I want to give this one these video clips he's a
[02:42:51.140 --> 02:42:56.780]  you know he was an NCAA wrestler he's fast he's powerful you know what what
[02:42:56.780 --> 02:43:02.340]  kind of before he won the ultimate fighting championship TV show then went
[02:43:02.340 --> 02:43:05.420]  on to and some of the highlights of his career knocking out with Chuck Liddell
[02:43:05.420 --> 02:43:09.900]  and then becoming the light heavyweight champion I mean he is no joke he's been
[02:43:09.900 --> 02:43:15.380]  part of the UFC for ten years there's not an element of his game that isn't
[02:43:15.380 --> 02:43:19.060]  dangerous you know he has submissions he has submission defense he has powerful
[02:43:19.060 --> 02:43:23.900]  hands you know he was one of my training partners in Albuquerque New
[02:43:23.900 --> 02:43:30.460]  Mexico he I went there to help him get ready for a fight and he asked to fight
[02:43:30.460 --> 02:43:34.900]  me I was the guy that came there to help him get ready for a fight and then he
[02:43:34.900 --> 02:43:38.260]  goes to the UFC and says hey my old training partner that flew to Albuquerque
[02:43:38.260 --> 02:43:41.860]  to help me get ready as a good teammate can I fight him as my first fight at 185
[02:43:41.860 --> 02:43:45.100]  and then I don't know what he thought that I was gonna say no to this fight
[02:43:45.100 --> 02:43:49.540]  which is idiotic of course I think he knows it's gonna be big it's it is a big fight but
[02:43:49.540 --> 02:43:53.620]  big I mean that you haven't fought in years I mean I'm only faster I'm only
[02:43:53.620 --> 02:43:59.620]  stronger and I'm even more powerful than I was I'm hitting harder my wrestling
[02:43:59.620 --> 02:44:02.900]  is better Mike there's not an element of who I am as an athlete and as a
[02:44:02.900 --> 02:44:08.700]  fighter that hasn't improved so he's gonna start over he's in for what so
[02:44:08.700 --> 02:44:14.020]  Rashad Evans on November 12th isn't for enough a very very rough night I'm gonna
[02:44:14.020 --> 02:44:17.500]  dominate him every single way you want to stand in box with me you want to bang
[02:44:17.500 --> 02:44:21.100]  with me you're gonna get knocked out you want to go to the ground and try to
[02:44:21.100 --> 02:44:26.340]  wear me out you're just tap now don't even show up to the fight no if you're
[02:44:26.340 --> 02:44:29.740]  gonna sprawl and brawl which you know you're gonna plan for me coming forward
[02:44:29.740 --> 02:44:35.820]  like a maniac I'm coming for you what do you do if he comes out swinging
[02:44:35.820 --> 02:44:40.860]  toe-to-toe I would love nothing more I think he knows that his chin has
[02:44:40.860 --> 02:44:45.180]  deteriorated to a place that it is not sustainable to stand and bang with guys
[02:44:45.180 --> 02:44:49.380]  he he used to have a chin it's not there anymore if I touch his chin he's gonna
[02:44:49.380 --> 02:44:54.260]  go he's gonna go out I don't see him coming and wanting to go toe-to-toe with
[02:44:54.260 --> 02:44:59.820]  me if he does I'm down to bang I'm I'll be a hundred percent in for a slugfest
[02:44:59.820 --> 02:45:04.900]  whatever so your final message bottom line what's gonna happen bottom line
[02:45:04.900 --> 02:45:08.940]  November 12th in New York the first fight at Madison Square Gardens for the
[02:45:08.940 --> 02:45:14.620]  UFC Rashad Evans you're gonna be dominated in every single way you don't

[02:50:00.860 --> 02:50:04.700]  be a Tim Kennedy I don't plan to be in super great shape I used to jog almost
[02:50:04.700 --> 02:50:07.700]  every day and with weights for 10 years I didn't work out I gained at 90 something
[02:50:07.700 --> 02:50:12.260]  pounds but with some real vitality extra to their products it's something
[02:50:12.260 --> 02:50:15.900]  lose over 70 pounds of a frickin fat I gained back about 30 40 pounds of muscle
[02:50:15.900 --> 02:50:21.020]  I'm a pretty big guy and it's it's it's incredible what mother nature gave us and
[02:50:21.020 --> 02:50:23.820]  your purchase supports everything we're doing but you heard Tim Kennedy who I
[02:50:23.820 --> 02:50:27.340]  never intended to be a sponsor I mean he can have sponsors out the ones who's
[02:50:27.340 --> 02:50:32.260]  got any sponsor he wants and he tried it and it really helped him I like it you
[02:50:32.260 --> 02:50:38.340]  know is it evil of me that I don't want Hillary's camp to start using ever any
[02:50:38.340 --> 02:50:42.820]  of our supplements because she might actually get a little healthier you know
[02:50:42.820 --> 02:50:45.940]  we thought of that as a joke to send her some super film of Italian people so
[02:50:45.940 --> 02:50:48.820]  wait we don't want to help her it might actually help her I know that's almost
[02:50:48.820 --> 02:50:54.020]  unhuman of us but no but really like it affects change I take super male
[02:50:54.020 --> 02:51:00.340]  vitality every single day I love it my wife loves it my coaches love it
[02:51:00.340 --> 02:51:04.100]  because I have energy non-stop I love the giggling I mean it let's be honest
[02:51:04.100 --> 02:51:09.020]  about it the most honorable thing within days is libido there's a foundation to
[02:51:09.020 --> 02:51:13.180]  being an athlete no there's kind of the forced cornerstones you got to have
[02:51:13.180 --> 02:51:17.420]  healthy sleep you have to have that workload that hard work in the gym or
[02:51:17.420 --> 02:51:21.500]  every day and your job whatever that is hard workload then you have to be
[02:51:21.500 --> 02:51:26.620]  intimate you have to be connected with your spouse or whoever you with and
[02:51:26.620 --> 02:51:31.020]  then lastly is nutrition nutrition all of those are equally important they and
[02:51:31.020 --> 02:51:34.980]  they all play parts in how you are healthy as a man so for me as a male
[02:51:34.980 --> 02:51:38.460]  athlete I have to be intimate with my wife every day a couple times a day if I
[02:51:38.460 --> 02:51:41.620]  can you know like I have to get good sleep I have to have that good work and I
[02:51:41.620 --> 02:51:45.020]  have to have that good food and these things super male vitality is one of
[02:51:45.020 --> 02:51:50.620]  those things that is cornerstone to who I am as an athlete and as a man I'm
[02:51:50.620 --> 02:51:54.500]  telling you it already funds so much for operations our best-selling product if
[02:51:54.500 --> 02:52:00.260]  if the average guy would just get it and experience it I mean it's
[02:52:00.260 --> 02:52:03.060]  incredible and then you look at the reporters the work we're doing is a I
[02:52:03.060 --> 02:52:07.980]  coined the term 361 because if something doesn't have other people winning and
[02:52:07.980 --> 02:52:11.460]  even if you attack me I love beating you but for average folks I want to do
[02:52:11.460 --> 02:52:14.180]  something like I like making my yard nice I like helping my neighbor have a
[02:52:14.180 --> 02:52:16.860]  nice shirt I want to help my neighbor fix his car it's just like we're all in
[02:52:16.860 --> 02:52:20.780]  this together and and it's the same thing I only sell products that I mean I go to
[02:52:20.780 --> 02:52:25.180]  the top developers the country and I say I want the ultimate they go well that's
[02:52:25.180 --> 02:52:28.020]  gonna be cold press and it's gonna be these 20 something herbs and to be really
[02:52:28.020 --> 02:52:30.980]  expensive because we that they're never dried they're never kept in some
[02:52:30.980 --> 02:52:34.900]  warehouse for a year or for us and this is the best it's wet it's wet and then
[02:52:34.900 --> 02:52:39.620]  it's like wine they crush it they put her in oil they mix it that's why whatever
[02:52:39.620 --> 02:52:43.860]  it is in the essences of these oils yeah you take powdered pills it still does
[02:52:43.860 --> 02:52:47.260]  something but there's something more when it's when it's wet and so that's why
[02:52:47.260 --> 02:52:52.740]  literal Leviathan fat ass lost 70 pounds of fat on this that took me years of
[02:52:52.740 --> 02:52:56.180]  doing it but I was swimming two miles a day some days I had a lake house then I
[02:52:56.180 --> 02:53:00.220]  would swim across the lake one mile and back I would get out in a way 280
[02:53:00.220 --> 02:53:03.580]  something pounds I couldn't lose it I wasn't even and it was because I was
[02:53:03.580 --> 02:53:08.460]  missing the key elements and it was when I got on Supermail and X2 iodine that it

[02:54:00.260 --> 02:54:04.300]  forget the title we've given it but this is Tim Kennedy on the secrets to being
[02:54:04.300 --> 02:54:09.340]  self-sufficient urban farming is going on everywhere strangely enough I think
[02:54:09.340 --> 02:54:12.260]  it's great look at George Washington Carver and others it's being pioneered
[02:54:12.260 --> 02:54:17.380]  by black Americans in Chicago and LA and other areas but urban farming this is
[02:54:17.380 --> 02:54:32.620]  the key to self-sufficiency here it is again I'm not gonna narrate this it's
[02:54:32.620 --> 02:54:41.940]  mainly audiovisual. You watch this you see us digging in mud you know our
[02:54:41.940 --> 02:54:47.220]  shovels hands are dirty you're like why what's the point what's the reason I
[02:54:47.220 --> 02:55:01.180]  know it's fulfilling there's nothing like the end result of your hard work
[02:55:01.180 --> 02:55:06.180]  giving something tangible heck in this case of the nutritious and edible and
[02:55:06.180 --> 02:55:12.100]  feeling those nutrients and tasting it you know the the idea of this quick easy
[02:55:12.100 --> 02:55:19.020]  fix the handout that enabling the entitlement it's got to go like this
[02:55:19.020 --> 02:55:25.060]  is it the point of you know if you're an American and you believe in how great
[02:55:25.060 --> 02:55:31.500]  America was it can be it's being able to appreciate the little things where
[02:55:31.500 --> 02:55:35.980]  does your food come from is it even food you know you go to the grocery store and
[02:55:35.980 --> 02:55:40.100]  you you go and pick your stuff off the shelf or out of the freezer is there any
[02:55:40.100 --> 02:55:44.540]  real food in there you know it's a beautiful thing it's a beautiful
[02:55:44.540 --> 02:55:49.940]  lifestyle and when we pull that radish out of the ground and took a bite out of
[02:55:49.940 --> 02:55:55.780]  it it was so powerful with so many different flavors nothing like you can
[02:55:55.780 --> 02:55:59.100]  just go to the store and grab a knee it's nothing like that and when you when
[02:55:59.100 --> 02:56:03.700]  that is just a tiny example and you blow that up to this lifestyle of eating that
[02:56:03.700 --> 02:56:08.180]  way and feeding your body with these amazing delicious nutrient real food
[02:56:08.180 --> 02:56:11.780]  it brings your body to another level so you know if you if you're not if you're
[02:56:11.780 --> 02:56:17.060]  an elite athlete or you're sick or you're having these daily problems or
[02:56:17.060 --> 02:56:21.580]  these aches don't you are we eat maybe start changing things up and finding and
[02:56:21.580 --> 02:56:26.020]  getting connected you can start anywhere you know like this might seem
[02:56:26.020 --> 02:56:30.340]  daunting like this is a farm this is beautiful this is complex you don't have
[02:56:30.340 --> 02:56:35.260]  to this is not a starting point it was for him Sean literally just made a
[02:56:35.260 --> 02:56:39.420]  decision I'm going to change and then change
[02:56:54.940 --> 02:57:03.340]  rain the start start rain on us kind of hard take a break for you my question
[02:57:03.340 --> 02:57:09.500]  is why why are you passionate about it like why why do you care about this when
[02:57:09.500 --> 02:57:15.460]  I started I didn't even have an answer for that I mean people kept asking why
[02:57:15.460 --> 02:57:20.300]  and I said I don't know I mean I just felt this this drive this weird a innate
[02:57:20.300 --> 02:57:25.220]  passion that was in me I mean I didn't have any background in it and it's scary
[02:57:25.220 --> 02:57:32.220]  to step into a way of life that you know nothing about but this without a doubt
[02:57:32.220 --> 02:57:37.940]  is the way we were supposed to live our lives and because we haven't for the
[02:57:37.940 --> 02:57:44.220]  past 50 years you can see the mess that it got us into so if I can if I can use
[02:57:44.220 --> 02:57:51.780]  this small space I mean this one acre space to to inspire to educate to make
[02:57:51.780 --> 02:57:56.340]  a stronger America to make a stronger Texas but that is something my heart
[02:57:56.340 --> 02:58:05.060]  is completely behind what we're coming to a point across a turn of the road a
[02:58:05.060 --> 02:58:10.140]  why an intersection that if we don't change we are gonna be we're gonna be a
[02:58:10.140 --> 02:58:16.020]  dying nation we're gonna have it is not sustainable what we've been doing this
[02:58:16.020 --> 02:58:22.540]  this is a micro example of the bigger picture of what is America and how can
[02:58:22.540 --> 02:58:30.340]  America be great it's hard work it's sustainability it's appreciating what
[02:58:30.340 --> 02:58:35.540]  you are and how you got there now you are what you eat and do it we're eating

[03:04:59.780 --> 03:05:03.660]  with us and recently released emails a column Powell's correspondence with a
[03:05:03.660 --> 03:05:07.420]  Democrat donor Powell gives the most succinct and accurate description ever of
[03:05:07.420 --> 03:05:11.340]  Hillary Clinton saying she's a 70 year old person with a long track record
[03:05:11.340 --> 03:05:17.180]  unbridled ambition greedy but it gets even better he said I'd rather not have
[03:05:17.180 --> 03:05:23.080]  to vote for her although she is a friend I respect respect no he'll vote for her
[03:05:23.080 --> 03:05:27.300]  because she's part of the club like the establishment elitists of Bohemian
[03:05:27.300 --> 03:05:32.060]  Grove whom Powell said in another email absolutely hate Trump most of those
[03:05:32.060 --> 03:05:35.860]  Bohemian Grove he said will vote against him but quite a few will not vote for
[03:05:35.860 --> 03:05:39.220]  Hillary and will vote for a third-party candidate so while elitists gather in
[03:05:39.220 --> 03:05:43.180]  Bohemian Grove for as a Washington Post describes it heavy drinking super
[03:05:43.180 --> 03:05:47.460]  secret talks druid worship and other rituals you know like mock child
[03:05:47.460 --> 03:05:52.300]  sacrifices to Mollick those people the Satan worshipping pedophiles won't be
[03:05:52.300 --> 03:05:56.980]  voting for Trump but they're just fine with Hillary and Gary Johnson for info

[03:08:42.300 --> 03:08:46.860]  asked me to do this and I couldn't be happier this is the kind of stuff I
[03:08:46.860 --> 03:08:53.820]  love doing talking about the the the garbage that we're being fed on a daily
[03:08:53.820 --> 03:08:59.820]  basis I do it on my show too but I don't know there's a whole different vibe on
[03:08:59.820 --> 03:09:03.700]  info wars and I gotta tell you I love it I'm thrilled to be here thanks so much
[03:09:03.700 --> 03:09:12.580]  for having me we'll start right off Hillary Clinton back she's back of
[03:09:12.580 --> 03:09:19.340]  course Sunday she collapsed at a 9-11 memorial event that was going on the
[03:09:19.340 --> 03:09:26.460]  15th anniversary and well if you listen to mainstream media she stumbled she
[03:09:26.460 --> 03:09:34.460]  stumbled off a curb she stubbed her toe she broke a heel on her shoe the secret
[03:09:34.460 --> 03:09:42.140]  service literally had to drag her by her her shoe tips into a a camouflaged
[03:09:42.140 --> 03:09:50.300]  ambulance and cart her away to Chelsea's house because when a 70 year old 68 year
[03:09:50.300 --> 03:09:56.420]  old woman collapses and is known to have previous medical problems that's what
[03:09:56.420 --> 03:10:01.020]  you do you take her to the daughter's house like it's the 1800s and wait for
[03:10:01.020 --> 03:10:05.820]  duck baker from little house on the prairie to show up she she's an ill
[03:10:05.820 --> 03:10:11.060]  woman so we know what happened she well actually we don't know what happened
[03:10:11.060 --> 03:10:17.740]  apparently she had pneumonia which was diagnosed the Friday previous to when
[03:10:17.740 --> 03:10:25.820]  she capsized and then we didn't hear about until she collapsed and then her
[03:10:25.820 --> 03:10:31.700]  husband gets on yesterday and says it was the flu so we were talking around
[03:10:31.700 --> 03:10:38.860]  here saying it's a new thing flumonia she has flumonia which is a brand new she
[03:10:38.860 --> 03:10:42.540]  could make up anything make up any name you want to call anything there it is
[03:10:42.540 --> 03:10:47.900]  it's here she is just kind of you know just working away into the van it's all
[03:10:47.900 --> 03:10:54.260]  cool as they drag her by her the tips of her toes she's stiff right here there
[03:10:54.260 --> 03:10:59.900]  goes one two her head is like a bobble head now she goes down completely they
[03:10:59.900 --> 03:11:05.100]  throw her in the van and take off to Parkland General Hospital where Mrs.
[03:11:05.100 --> 03:11:09.260]  Kennedy will oh that's right that was a different thing that happened just
[03:11:09.260 --> 03:11:14.340]  unbelievable though that this is happening but she's back today her first
[03:11:14.340 --> 03:11:21.860]  day back on the campaign trail as they say she got on her plane which was
[03:11:21.860 --> 03:11:25.780]  amazing because everybody was waiting for the video of her to get on the plane
[03:11:25.780 --> 03:11:29.340]  they didn't know if she was gonna have one of those one of those seats like the
[03:11:29.340 --> 03:11:33.260]  old lady in gremlins remember that was she was going up the stairs and then you
[03:11:33.260 --> 03:11:38.740]  go like this and you slowly go go up the stairs or if she was just gonna be
[03:11:38.740 --> 03:11:44.580]  hobbling with a hurricane or something to get up the stairs but I gotta tell
[03:11:44.580 --> 03:11:51.980]  you and I can only assume they drugged her up they they poked her with cortisone
[03:11:51.980 --> 03:11:56.980]  in the joints and some type of amphetamine to just keep her going
[03:11:56.980 --> 03:12:02.380]  enough to get up those stairs because this was the first image we got of her
[03:12:02.380 --> 03:12:12.480]  after she fell over at the 9-11 thing so they wanted that optic as they call it
[03:12:12.480 --> 03:12:19.540]  optic to look good it had to look good so they had to have just loaded her up
[03:12:19.540 --> 03:12:23.940]  with everything all right Hillary come here come here this stuff here just
[03:12:23.940 --> 03:12:29.260]  whatever it takes get on the plane so she she went up the stairs she wasn't
[03:12:29.260 --> 03:12:35.700]  leaping a bounding up the stairs but she grabbed the rail and it did look bad
[03:12:35.700 --> 03:12:41.460]  it did look bad she gets on the plane now on the plane is a Hillary of course I
[03:12:41.460 --> 03:12:51.860]  would gather the flight crew Hillary's staff Joseph Goebbels Himmler her staff
[03:12:51.860 --> 03:13:00.140]  and be scared out of their gourd media all the media that is allowed the
[03:13:00.140 --> 03:13:09.180]  privilege of being on Hillary's airplane is petrified to ask her anything
[03:13:09.180 --> 03:13:13.900]  anything of any value I believe we've gotten questions about how was your
[03:13:13.900 --> 03:13:20.340]  Labor Day that was something that that came up just compelling stuff so she's
[03:13:20.340 --> 03:13:28.980]  back from flumonia she gets on the plane the press is there nothing I do
[03:13:28.980 --> 03:13:34.060]  believe they they spoke about a movie or something that she watched or a book she
[03:13:34.060 --> 03:13:42.340]  read this is serious they are petrified to ask her a question when they asked
[03:13:42.340 --> 03:13:48.900]  her about the Trump polls when she was on plane last before she got a carted
[03:13:48.900 --> 03:13:54.460]  away she said that she wasn't gonna answer that right now turned around and
[03:13:54.460 --> 03:14:02.020]  her staff looked at that reporter like oh boy oh did you screw up I was waiting
[03:14:02.020 --> 03:14:07.260]  for a Bond villain trapdoor to open on the plane and just have the reporter
[03:14:07.260 --> 03:14:14.580]  plummet to their death and then just add another death on to the the Clinton
[03:14:14.580 --> 03:14:22.100]  trail of bodies but so she's back where we're eagerly looking forward to seeing
[03:14:22.100 --> 03:14:26.820]  our next speech to see if she could stand at a podium for any length of time
[03:14:26.820 --> 03:14:33.140]  and not collapse looking forward to seeing that other people that are
[03:14:33.140 --> 03:14:39.780]  petrified Dr. Drew this was a great story Dr. Drew you might know Drew
[03:14:39.780 --> 03:14:45.740]  Pinsky he it was with Adam Karola for a while and then he went on on his own he
[03:14:45.740 --> 03:14:52.220]  had a rehab TV show where apparently the the sequel to that was the people
[03:14:52.220 --> 03:14:57.420]  dying that were in his rehab I don't know how many ex rock stars and actors
[03:14:57.420 --> 03:15:04.420]  died after doing rehab but he was working at CNN one of their medical
[03:15:04.420 --> 03:15:13.260]  experts had a show on there and he dared he dared question Hillary's medical
[03:15:13.260 --> 03:15:18.740]  care and her health but he was questioning what are these doctors doing
[03:15:18.740 --> 03:15:24.860]  some of the medication and treatment she's getting is archaic so why why is
[03:15:24.860 --> 03:15:31.980]  that happening when she's she should be getting top tier medical attention so he
[03:15:31.980 --> 03:15:38.820]  dared question that on a radio interview well again you don't mess with
[03:15:38.820 --> 03:15:45.940]  Hillary oh boy ootensie he was done gone there it is Adam Karola Dr. Drew now he
[03:15:45.940 --> 03:15:54.020]  refuses to talk about Hillary's health and jeopardize career he's scared of the
[03:15:54.020 --> 03:16:00.340]  New World Order he's petrified here's a guy who's at a very long and lucrative
[03:16:00.340 --> 03:16:07.140]  career in broadcasting and he is now afraid to talk about Hillary Clinton
[03:16:07.140 --> 03:16:13.380]  all Adam Karola wanted Adam's got a show and Drew is a very close friend of
[03:16:13.380 --> 03:16:20.900]  his and an associate for decades of Drew all he wanted was for Drew to call
[03:16:20.900 --> 03:16:27.780]  into his show and talk about pneumonia and Drew got petrified and then Adam
[03:16:27.780 --> 03:16:31.820]  said to him look don't even mention Hillary I just want to hear what your
[03:16:31.820 --> 03:16:41.100]  take on people of age that have pneumonia nope he wouldn't do it and Adam
[03:16:41.100 --> 03:16:46.940]  understood and and but this is the world we're living in this is the frightening
[03:16:46.940 --> 03:16:53.580]  petrifying world we are living in and if you believe anything that the
[03:16:53.580 --> 03:17:02.020]  traditional mass media is telling you oh oh are you blind naive mentally
[03:17:02.020 --> 03:17:09.340]  disturbed because no truth is coming out now and the media is not even trying to
[03:17:09.340 --> 03:17:14.100]  hide it they are in bed with Hillary Clinton I know it conjures up a
[03:17:14.100 --> 03:17:20.620]  disturbing image but they are in bed with Hillary Clinton they don't even
[03:17:20.620 --> 03:17:26.300]  hide it anymore they don't even hide it they're saying we want Hillary to win
[03:17:26.300 --> 03:17:30.700]  we don't want Donald Trump winning this election so we are going to have some of
[03:17:30.700 --> 03:17:36.620]  the most biased reporting that has ever been done in this country this is akin
[03:17:36.620 --> 03:17:45.300]  to the to the Joseph McCarthy Kami hearings in the 50s where people were
[03:17:45.300 --> 03:17:51.460]  being blackballed if you criticize the liberals Democrats Hillary Clinton you
[03:17:51.460 --> 03:17:58.780]  can be blackballed from having a job in the media you must tow that company line
[03:17:58.780 --> 03:18:07.220]  and not insult the Queen and people that do find themselves jammed up like Dr.
[03:18:07.220 --> 03:18:12.700]  Drew but although a CNN did say oh no this was in the works a while we were
[03:18:12.700 --> 03:18:19.060]  we're changing around us some of the personnel here at CNN so it's a
[03:18:19.060 --> 03:18:24.260]  coincidence one of the many coincidence that happened when somebody says
[03:18:24.260 --> 03:18:31.940]  something ill of Hillary Clinton it's astounding isn't it the another thing
[03:18:31.940 --> 03:18:38.540]  about Hillary that just recently came out of course the WikiLeaks the emails I
[03:18:38.540 --> 03:18:45.860]  love this as if this whole campaign that's gone about a year I guess a little
[03:18:45.860 --> 03:18:52.460]  over a year actually isn't crazy enough without even the WikiLeaks and any it
[03:18:52.460 --> 03:18:59.420]  would still be a crazy campaign this whole thing but then you sprinkle this
[03:18:59.420 --> 03:19:06.260]  extra it's like an amazing seasoning on an already amazing dish these emails
[03:19:06.260 --> 03:19:13.380]  come flying out every so often and it's they're amazing to read but then to watch
[03:19:13.380 --> 03:19:21.220]  the media scrambling to try and save their queen from any damage that these
[03:19:21.220 --> 03:19:29.660]  emails might be doing is another fun thing to watch Colin Powell his emails
[03:19:29.660 --> 03:19:38.860]  to a big-wig Democratic donor are funny there's some genuinely funny things in
[03:19:38.860 --> 03:19:45.660]  there tragically funny but of course the media doesn't want to address it their
[03:19:45.660 --> 03:19:52.740]  top headline out of this was that Colin Powell says Donald Trump is a racist and
[03:19:52.740 --> 03:20:01.820]  a national disgrace national disgrace and that was their big story something
[03:20:01.820 --> 03:20:06.340]  shocking just happened in a Coast Guard unit in San Diego the old guys in the
[03:20:06.340 --> 03:20:10.380]  unit have turned the tables and are now destroying the young bucks in head-to-head
[03:20:10.380 --> 03:20:15.260]  fitness tests how is this even possible turns out the old guys in this unit have

[03:23:57.660 --> 03:24:26.460]  55505 yes we're back info wars dot com honored pleasure to be here Anthony
[03:24:26.460 --> 03:24:34.620]  Cumia welcome and again I thank you for having me this is a fantastic we were
[03:24:34.620 --> 03:24:39.460]  talking about of course Hillary her health issues and I was reading some
[03:24:39.460 --> 03:24:45.420]  tweets from Hillary I don't know how effective Twitter is in the big scheme of
[03:24:45.420 --> 03:24:49.800]  things you hear some people say it means nothing you're other people saying it
[03:24:49.800 --> 03:24:53.420]  means everything that it's changing people's opinions and and what they say
[03:24:53.420 --> 03:24:58.100]  I know damn well over the the course of many years that I've been using Twitter
[03:24:58.100 --> 03:25:03.500]  I've not changed anyone's mind and no one has changed my mind so I don't think
[03:25:03.500 --> 03:25:08.060]  it's an effective tool in changing people's opinion but maybe as a slow
[03:25:08.060 --> 03:25:14.580]  chipping away kind of thing it works works on the weak minded like a Jedi
[03:25:14.580 --> 03:25:20.460]  mind trick you will not vote for the Hillary perhaps but I can't see it
[03:25:20.460 --> 03:25:25.220]  really being that effective but the politicians love getting on board I
[03:25:25.220 --> 03:25:33.020]  think they're preaching to the choir but Hillary has some of the most bizarre
[03:25:33.020 --> 03:25:38.220]  tweets I've ever seen she will tweet things and you swear that they are
[03:25:38.220 --> 03:25:44.020]  against her and she's just taken out Trump or taken out her name and put in
[03:25:44.020 --> 03:25:52.300]  Trump's name there was one today I read about Trump's health records it was from
[03:25:52.300 --> 03:25:57.900]  Hillary and she said Donald Trump isn't hasn't released his health records and
[03:25:57.900 --> 03:26:03.900]  assuming he's trying to hide something and I read this and go how is this woman
[03:26:03.900 --> 03:26:10.660]  when Donald Trump is running around like a maniac doing multiple rallies a day he
[03:26:10.660 --> 03:26:18.100]  went to Mexico he flew to Mexico had a press conference in Mexico there Trump
[03:26:18.100 --> 03:26:22.300]  on releasing detailed medical records I have no problem in doing so he still
[03:26:22.300 --> 03:26:27.180]  hasn't released them and then there's a video about you know him and his
[03:26:27.180 --> 03:26:35.380]  records Trump runs around like a nut I love it the man has shown nothing that
[03:26:35.380 --> 03:26:42.700]  would lead anyone to believe he is ill has any acute problems okay he's got a
[03:26:42.700 --> 03:26:50.380]  cute daughter I'll tell you that but any acute medical problems but but Hillary's
[03:26:50.380 --> 03:26:58.500]  the one that's been bedridden for a few days after collapsing in 78 degree
[03:26:58.500 --> 03:27:06.900]  breezy weather from the heat and this is how the Hillary campaign runs find out
[03:27:06.900 --> 03:27:12.420]  what everyone's saying about you and then throw it on the opponent and see
[03:27:12.420 --> 03:27:17.540]  what sticks and it can only mean that the people backing Hillary and the
[03:27:17.540 --> 03:27:26.860]  supporters of Hillary are either brain damaged or so naive that they they're
[03:27:26.860 --> 03:27:34.780]  blinded to any truth about their Lord and Savior Hillary Clinton we were
[03:27:34.780 --> 03:27:41.020]  talking before the break about about Colin Powell's emails which are
[03:27:41.020 --> 03:27:50.100]  hilarious the press has cut off every bit that's funny I mean saying that
[03:27:50.100 --> 03:27:59.140]  dicking bimbos which is a quote there there it is that's funny stuff it should
[03:27:59.140 --> 03:28:04.940]  be on the news and it was said in an email and it's pertinent Hillary has
[03:28:04.940 --> 03:28:12.300]  her husband campaigning for her when she's a ill in bed so it does it's not
[03:28:12.300 --> 03:28:17.940]  something that's just an aside they also would not report on mainstream media
[03:28:17.940 --> 03:28:23.020]  that Colin Powell said he doesn't want to vote for her because of her many
[03:28:23.020 --> 03:28:30.340]  faults her blind ambition doesn't like her the fact that that Hillary doesn't
[03:28:30.340 --> 03:28:35.940]  like Obama feels like she was passed over in 2008 and those are in those
[03:28:35.940 --> 03:28:44.460]  emails and again the media so sleazy and in bed with Hillary Clinton won't
[03:28:44.460 --> 03:28:49.260]  report on things that put her in a bad light and not even trying to cover it
[03:28:49.260 --> 03:28:55.380]  up for a second it's embarrassing it's embarrassing and it's it's showing
[03:28:55.380 --> 03:29:01.500]  because America's trust in mass media sinks to a new low a new low what is it
[03:29:01.500 --> 03:29:14.340]  now it's there it is 32% say they have a great deal or fair amount of trust 32%
[03:29:14.340 --> 03:29:20.100]  and who are they who are the 32% I always wonder that it's like you read
[03:29:20.100 --> 03:29:27.620]  something that should be so obvious and I don't know I have no idea 14%
[03:29:27.620 --> 03:29:32.060]  Republicans express trust down from 32% last year confidence drops among
[03:29:32.060 --> 03:29:39.820]  younger and older Americans they can't get away with this forever and it's
[03:29:39.820 --> 03:29:44.180]  getting worse and we're noticing we're gonna take a break but we'll be right
[03:29:44.180 --> 03:29:48.740]  back in full wars I'm Anthony Cummings
[03:29:49.340 --> 03:29:58.740]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[03:30:00.620 --> 03:30:05.700]  a British special forces sharpshooter in Syria just killed a top ISIS
[03:30:05.700 --> 03:30:10.860]  executioner in 3G Hotties with a single bullet over a mile away doing so just
[03:30:10.860 --> 03:30:14.380]  seconds before the terrorist and his friends were going to burn 12 hostages
[03:30:14.380 --> 03:30:18.140]  alive with a flamethrower the unidentified ISIS leader was said to be
[03:30:18.140 --> 03:30:21.940]  on the US most kill list for several months and is known in Syria for being
[03:30:21.940 --> 03:30:25.980]  one of the most sadistic ISIS leaders it was he this week that was sent into a
[03:30:25.980 --> 03:30:29.900]  fireball by a British marksman who struck a fuel tank affixed to the
[03:30:29.900 --> 03:30:34.140]  leaders back meanwhile Hilary Clinton is busy on the campaign trail here in the
[03:30:34.140 --> 03:30:37.580]  States she makes little mention of the mess made in Syria and never
[03:30:37.580 --> 03:30:41.700]  acknowledges that ISIS terrorist to build a substantial arsenal including US
[03:30:41.700 --> 03:30:46.100]  made weapons obtained from the Iraqi army in Syrian opposition groups groups
[03:30:46.100 --> 03:30:50.660]  of the US State Department armed no official US policy or even acknowledgment

[03:35:26.700 --> 03:35:31.860]  captivated and and you know it also got me the fact that his friendship with
[03:35:31.860 --> 03:35:37.020]  Jesse Ventura because I used to watch that Jesse show he had the conspiracy
[03:35:37.020 --> 03:35:42.060]  show and sometimes Alex would be on it Alex what do you think about mind
[03:35:42.060 --> 03:35:49.620]  control I believe the harp system is he's just doing that the whole time but
[03:35:49.620 --> 03:35:54.540]  I've been I've been a fan forever and it's a it's a pleasure a pleasure for me
[03:35:54.540 --> 03:36:05.300]  to be here doing this we got Tim Kane who of course is Hillary's VP candidate I
[03:36:05.300 --> 03:36:10.340]  was watching Pence Trump's vice presidential candidate he was given a
[03:36:10.340 --> 03:36:16.500]  speech with some Republicans and man was he good he was really talking about
[03:36:16.500 --> 03:36:24.060]  issues and talking about Trump and what what he and Trump the vision they have
[03:36:24.060 --> 03:36:30.660]  for the country and it really resonated it felt good when when you hear them
[03:36:30.660 --> 03:36:36.180]  say make America great again and and you hear the Hillary campaign bash that as
[03:36:36.180 --> 03:36:42.300]  if what they're saying is America isn't great now it's infuriating because you
[03:36:42.300 --> 03:36:47.660]  know it means bringing jobs back he's discussed everything it means bringing
[03:36:47.660 --> 03:36:55.100]  jobs back to the United States fighting poverty in inner cities education
[03:36:55.100 --> 03:37:00.820]  borders are our borders are a disaster another thing he's talking about is
[03:37:00.820 --> 03:37:06.780]  making the military strong again because he said the military is also a wreck
[03:37:06.780 --> 03:37:12.820]  it's a disaster and then the Hillary campaign turns that spins it around to
[03:37:12.820 --> 03:37:20.780]  say that that Donald was bashing our our soldiers that's what they do they lie
[03:37:20.780 --> 03:37:26.460]  to you right to your face and the fact of the matter is if you look back to the
[03:37:26.460 --> 03:37:32.140]  Jimmy Carter days the Jimmy Carter presidency and 1980 when when Ronald
[03:37:32.140 --> 03:37:39.580]  Reagan took over the military was a disaster it doesn't mean Jimmy Carter
[03:37:39.580 --> 03:37:44.340]  was bashing the troops or doesn't mean Ronald Reagan was bashing the troops
[03:37:44.340 --> 03:37:49.300]  saying that the military was a disaster it's who's in control and what little
[03:37:49.300 --> 03:37:56.260]  effort they're doing to keep our military strong and ready for whatever
[03:37:56.260 --> 03:38:02.300]  they might encounter and Barack Obama has not done that and he has made the
[03:38:02.300 --> 03:38:10.180]  military a laughing stock when you have Iranian boats Iranian boats chasing our
[03:38:10.180 --> 03:38:16.620]  destroyers around in the Middle East it's embarrassing when Russian fighters
[03:38:16.620 --> 03:38:27.540]  are inches away from our spy planes in open waters in an open airspace there's
[03:38:27.540 --> 03:38:34.220]  a problem there it has to be addressed and it never is because Barack doesn't
[03:38:34.220 --> 03:38:40.340]  want the America to be exceptional and strong and feared and respected in the
[03:38:40.340 --> 03:38:45.100]  world he don't want that at all that wasn't his his mission when he got in
[03:38:45.100 --> 03:38:49.940]  oh he's gotten some things done that's for sure since he's been in because the
[03:38:49.940 --> 03:38:55.900]  the world does not have any respect for this country anymore do we want to be the
[03:38:55.900 --> 03:38:59.940]  world police I don't think a lot of people want that role but sometimes you
[03:38:59.940 --> 03:39:05.220]  have to do things you don't really want to do and and since there's no one else
[03:39:05.220 --> 03:39:11.260]  to take up the reins we have to be there and I don't mean jumping into every
[03:39:11.260 --> 03:39:21.620]  conflict that happens around the globe but there has to be a source of democracy
[03:39:21.620 --> 03:39:28.740]  and freedom in the world that people can look to to not be afraid that ISIS is
[03:39:28.740 --> 03:39:32.740]  gonna run rampant all over the place that there might be a chance that we can
[03:39:32.740 --> 03:39:37.860]  get back to some civility and these are the things that would make America great
[03:39:37.860 --> 03:39:44.460]  again but if you listen to Hillary she says everything is great again so her
[03:39:44.460 --> 03:39:54.100]  vice presidential candidate Tim Cain on gun control I can't think of an issue I'd
[03:39:54.100 --> 03:40:02.980]  rather be aligned with than this if you're an American citizen who cherishes
[03:40:02.980 --> 03:40:09.060]  your constitutional rights what's your God given not government given which a
[03:40:09.060 --> 03:40:14.540]  lot of people have have the the false impression that the rights were given to
[03:40:14.540 --> 03:40:18.980]  you by the government no this is a list of things that you have just for being a
[03:40:18.980 --> 03:40:27.540]  human being in America they cannot be taken away is what the list is but man
[03:40:27.540 --> 03:40:34.500]  does the government get in there and make up their own rules and the second
[03:40:34.500 --> 03:40:40.540]  amendment I believe more than any other with the first being second on that
[03:40:40.540 --> 03:40:48.660]  list but the second amendment it has been trounced trounced by the government
[03:40:48.660 --> 03:40:52.700]  over over the course of the years and the past eight years of Obama being in
[03:40:52.700 --> 03:41:00.380]  office has done a lot of damage to our right to bear arms that shall not be
[03:41:00.380 --> 03:41:06.300]  infringed they just managed to infringe upon that over and over again and if
[03:41:06.300 --> 03:41:12.340]  you're an American citizen that that enjoys your right to defend yourself and
[03:41:12.340 --> 03:41:20.380]  your loved ones with the best possible tools why would the government want to
[03:41:20.380 --> 03:41:26.660]  take that from you think about that why does the government not want you to have
[03:41:26.660 --> 03:41:31.780]  the best tools for the job to protect yourself with if you're building a house
[03:41:31.780 --> 03:41:36.700]  you want the best tools don't you you know sit there with a old Amish tools
[03:41:36.700 --> 03:41:41.620]  now when you're a kid you ever build a tree fort Garrett when I was a kid I
[03:41:41.620 --> 03:41:47.780]  built a tree fort and you'd get bent nails from the job sites you use a rock
[03:41:47.780 --> 03:41:52.660]  for a hammer you'd make your mom mad because you stole a butter knife for a
[03:41:52.660 --> 03:41:58.180]  screwdriver you got the job done but it didn't look very good it kind of worked
[03:41:58.180 --> 03:42:04.860]  but they weren't the best tools for the job were they when it comes to my life
[03:42:04.860 --> 03:42:11.820]  I want the greatest tools available to defend myself I don't want to have to
[03:42:11.820 --> 03:42:17.740]  worry that I'm not fit enough or strong enough or imagine your loved one a wife
[03:42:17.740 --> 03:42:23.380]  or a daughter has to worry that the person trying to do her harm is stronger
[03:42:23.380 --> 03:42:29.700]  or faster than her I've heard this one we're all gone let's get rid of all guns
[03:42:29.700 --> 03:42:38.020]  we don't need them and of course bad guys criminals rapist murderers they're
[03:42:38.020 --> 03:42:42.940]  not gonna give their guns away and if you don't think drugs get into this
[03:42:42.940 --> 03:42:47.500]  country alcohol gets into the got into this country when a prohibition was an
[03:42:47.500 --> 03:42:52.980]  act and every other thing that's illegal in this country gets in guns will get
[03:42:52.980 --> 03:43:00.100]  in and the bad people will have them and you will be stuck bringing a knife to a
[03:43:00.100 --> 03:43:04.900]  gunfight which is could possibly be one of the scariest things that might ever
[03:43:04.900 --> 03:43:10.940]  happen to you when people say get rid of all guns how would you like it if you
[03:43:10.940 --> 03:43:15.900]  now had to know how to knife fight with somebody would that just be frightening
[03:43:15.900 --> 03:43:23.180]  like if someone's coming at you with a knife and you have a knife I don't think
[03:43:23.180 --> 03:43:28.620]  my chances are very good I've never night knife fought before I would rather
[03:43:28.620 --> 03:43:34.940]  defend myself with the best tool available so the government has decided
[03:43:34.940 --> 03:43:38.780]  or some people in the government has decided they don't want you to have
[03:43:38.780 --> 03:43:46.700]  that and it does all boil down to get it leaving the people powerless powerless
[03:43:46.700 --> 03:43:54.820]  fearful make them afraid there's a sense of security when you know you're an
[03:43:54.820 --> 03:44:02.060]  armed citizen a sense of security less fear when you know you can take care of
[03:44:02.060 --> 03:44:08.340]  your family yourself you don't need an outside agency to defend you you and
[03:44:08.340 --> 03:44:12.660]  your family the moment something happens you're sitting in your house
[03:44:12.660 --> 03:44:17.420]  something happens and people also say to me oh you sound so paranoid yeah read
[03:44:17.420 --> 03:44:22.940]  the news it never happens oh it's a one in a billion shot you play Lotto you hope
[03:44:22.940 --> 03:44:28.380]  you win that yeah the chances much more astronomical of winning Lotto than of
[03:44:28.380 --> 03:44:34.100]  of being violently accosted in or outside your house but for some reason you
[03:44:34.100 --> 03:44:40.660]  mentioned that your paranoid but you want to be able to defend yourself they
[03:44:40.660 --> 03:44:48.140]  don't want that they want you to be fearful and dependent on them this has
[03:44:48.140 --> 03:44:55.620]  been their MO the Democrats MO for centuries and decades and decades and
[03:44:55.620 --> 03:45:00.900]  perhaps centuries that they just do not want people to be self-sufficient when
[03:45:00.900 --> 03:45:06.580]  you need them you will vote for them and that's why they keep people on the till
[03:45:06.580 --> 03:45:13.260]  the government till for welfare that's why they want you to be completely
[03:45:13.260 --> 03:45:19.980]  unable to defend yourself and your family because then you're instead of
[03:45:19.980 --> 03:45:25.060]  reaching for the best tool available to defend you and your family you now have
[03:45:25.060 --> 03:45:33.060]  to reach for a phone and call someone a government agency to help you and most
[03:45:33.060 --> 03:45:37.020]  of the times they're there just to clean up and find out what happened not
[03:45:37.020 --> 03:45:42.180]  prevent it from happening that's in your hands I see all these alarm
[03:45:42.180 --> 03:45:47.500]  commercials are great when a guy's turning on his various alarms around his
[03:45:47.500 --> 03:45:55.740]  house and he goes looks out the window not on my watch and he's all secure in
[03:45:55.740 --> 03:46:00.060]  the fact that his family is safe and sound from any danger that might be
[03:46:00.060 --> 03:46:06.660]  having what if someone does get in not on your watch I wonder what goes through
[03:46:06.660 --> 03:46:11.660]  their heads when you know you don't have anything to protect yourself with you
[03:46:11.660 --> 03:46:17.340]  scan the room for a lamp nothing worse than a lamp to a gunfight one thing
[03:46:17.340 --> 03:46:22.420]  worse than a knife to a gunfight a lamp to a gunfight I'd say odds are you're
[03:46:22.420 --> 03:46:31.940]  losing so anytime you get candidates like Tim Kaine that are really pushing
[03:46:31.940 --> 03:46:38.420]  gun control think of the bigger picture it's not this lie that they present to
[03:46:38.420 --> 03:46:44.620]  you about wanting to make America safer it's not the lie that they're giving
[03:46:44.620 --> 03:46:52.700]  you that it's to protect the children what they want is you more dependent on
[03:46:52.700 --> 03:46:59.700]  them they want you afraid they want you to be afraid that you can't protect
[03:46:59.700 --> 03:47:03.660]  yourself and your family and you will look elsewhere for that protection and
[03:47:03.660 --> 03:47:11.180]  who is there to give it to you them so you pull the lever for them in November
[03:47:11.180 --> 03:47:16.340]  and that's what the deeper story is so whenever you see somebody professing
[03:47:16.340 --> 03:47:21.980]  that gun control is a great issue for the safety of this country it's just
[03:47:21.980 --> 03:47:29.980]  another lie much like the welfare thing and immigration oh boy when I hear that
[03:47:29.980 --> 03:47:38.540]  one Donald Trump is a racist because he's against immigrants oh they left that
[03:47:38.540 --> 03:47:46.420]  illegal word out again didn't they no it's undocumented immigrant illegal
[03:47:46.420 --> 03:47:52.500]  alien undocumented immigrant it's an illegal thing they're doing I want to
[03:47:52.500 --> 03:47:58.740]  make an undocumented withdrawal from a bank I'm gonna make an undocumented
[03:47:58.740 --> 03:48:04.060]  withdrawal and say it's not illegal I have no money in your bank this isn't a
[03:48:04.060 --> 03:48:09.540]  withdrawal slip or or a card in an ATM it's a note that says give me your money
[03:48:09.540 --> 03:48:16.260]  it's an undocumented withdrawal is that okay oh it's illegal it's a robbery
[03:48:16.260 --> 03:48:23.620]  right see how that works if you leave out the word illegal Donald Trump I've
[03:48:23.620 --> 03:48:27.940]  known many Border Patrol agents over the years I have a great friendship with
[03:48:27.940 --> 03:48:33.340]  law enforcement in this country over the years it's a thankless job and
[03:48:33.340 --> 03:48:40.620]  especially in 2016 I can't imagine anyone that would want that job not only is
[03:48:40.620 --> 03:48:43.860]  it stressful and everything it was for years and years and years life
[03:48:43.860 --> 03:48:48.580]  threatening but imagine you go to work you're working at a deli or something and
[03:48:48.580 --> 03:48:52.340]  you make someone a sandwich and they ask for ham in Swiss and you put a ham
[03:48:52.340 --> 03:48:57.260]  in American on there you made a mistake you hand it to the guy you now have a
[03:48:57.260 --> 03:49:03.580]  chance of going to prison why would you want that why would you want that job
[03:49:03.580 --> 03:49:09.660]  that's the new thing of being a cop and I'm not talking about bad cops that over
[03:49:09.660 --> 03:49:14.580]  the years have gone to prison for doing horrible things and abusing their power
[03:49:14.580 --> 03:49:21.980]  I'm talking about good cops that are now in the crosshairs because of political
[03:49:21.980 --> 03:49:29.660]  correctness outright lies pandering for votes because the like I said the police
[03:49:29.660 --> 03:49:35.580]  have a thankless job the Border Patrol has been gilded they have been
[03:49:35.580 --> 03:49:42.320]  castrated not allowed to use any of their power to protect the borders of this
[03:49:42.320 --> 03:49:50.780]  country wanting protected borders is now some kind of a strange racist
[03:49:50.780 --> 03:49:56.660]  unpatriotic thing to do when you really boil it down to just what it is it's
[03:49:56.660 --> 03:50:02.780]  insane to think it's a bad thing you don't want illegal immigrants rushing
[03:50:02.780 --> 03:50:06.700]  over the border and coming into this country now there's sub sectors of that
[03:50:06.700 --> 03:50:13.260]  why well crime well jobs we don't want to job just vetting who's coming in
[03:50:13.260 --> 03:50:18.500]  terrorism things like that but the bottom line is without any of those
[03:50:18.500 --> 03:50:27.740]  reasons it's just illegal as a nation a sovereign nation you want secured borders
[03:50:27.740 --> 03:50:37.940]  that has been numero uno in in in civil is civilization and civilized cities and
[03:50:37.940 --> 03:50:45.140]  Rome ancient Rome all of these empires borders because the second they collapse
[03:50:45.140 --> 03:50:51.540]  you lose your nation and that should be the only thing you ever have to say to
[03:50:51.540 --> 03:50:56.420]  these people that don't quite understand it will take a break Anthony

[03:54:28.060 --> 03:54:34.500]  for the opportunity to do this so much fun we had some real laughs over Colin
[03:54:34.500 --> 03:54:40.900]  Powell's emails and the whole wiki leaks thing has just been amazing but
[03:54:40.900 --> 03:54:51.020]  there is always a caveat isn't there our privacy is gone remember how innocent it
[03:54:51.020 --> 03:54:55.940]  was years ago when people didn't want to put their credit card info into the
[03:54:55.940 --> 03:55:00.500]  computer well not adorable because it was true we we would sit there and there
[03:55:00.500 --> 03:55:03.860]  was always a friend that would go I'm not putting my credit card info in there
[03:55:03.860 --> 03:55:09.980]  to buy sneakers or something and you're like yeah at first I was kind of like
[03:55:09.980 --> 03:55:15.780]  yeah all right I'm willing to take the chance for convenience and that's how
[03:55:15.780 --> 03:55:21.380]  they get you everything's convenient if you're willing to give up some of your
[03:55:21.380 --> 03:55:31.820]  privacy and once once these things became available we couldn't cough up our
[03:55:31.820 --> 03:55:39.620]  privacy fast enough oh do we love putting every bit of our lives out for
[03:55:39.620 --> 03:55:46.340]  you to see on this this is science fiction that we never predicted in
[03:55:46.340 --> 03:55:53.540]  movies or literature the fact that we would be given devices that we would
[03:55:53.540 --> 03:56:00.900]  then throw our personal information out to the world of our own free will it was
[03:56:00.900 --> 03:56:08.740]  always some Orwellian big brother I in the sky government tyrannical entity
[03:56:08.740 --> 03:56:16.180]  that had to force us to give our information to them and and make it
[03:56:16.180 --> 03:56:24.340]  available to various entities to use against us and as time went on and it
[03:56:24.340 --> 03:56:31.980]  hits you like a lightning bolt we freely just decided to give up our our
[03:56:31.980 --> 03:56:37.300]  information out of sheer convenience remember when easy pass first came
[03:56:37.300 --> 03:56:43.580]  around it's like hey guys you know that pain in the ass sitting on a line at the
[03:56:43.580 --> 03:56:47.500]  toll booth you don't have to do it anymore you whiz right through here put
[03:56:47.500 --> 03:56:55.940]  this in your windshield all right it's convenient mr. kumia here tell the court
[03:56:55.940 --> 03:57:02.940]  why you were going through this toll booth at this hour was it for adultery
[03:57:02.940 --> 03:57:07.740]  now things are just being used and you were like wait I just wanted to get
[03:57:07.740 --> 03:57:13.540]  through the toll booth now they know where I was and where I was going and
[03:57:13.540 --> 03:57:18.300]  then the biggest convenience of them all is this because everything you had to
[03:57:18.300 --> 03:57:24.660]  actually work for and go out and do you can now do from this with the one
[03:57:24.660 --> 03:57:31.180]  little catch all of your information is out there and you don't know if your
[03:57:31.180 --> 03:57:35.220]  phone calls are being listened in on and and not only do you not know they
[03:57:35.220 --> 03:57:42.580]  probably are your emails we laugh I look Colin Powell look what he said he said
[03:57:42.580 --> 03:57:47.780]  and you're laughing as your emails are going through the same thing it's just
[03:57:47.780 --> 03:57:54.780]  yours aren't as important or as funny in time they might be everyone is open to
[03:57:54.780 --> 03:58:00.500]  be a victim to it but the one revelation I got that really was was
[03:58:00.500 --> 03:58:06.780]  something is that big brother the big eye in the sky that guy on the video
[03:58:06.780 --> 03:58:13.940]  screen looking down on us was us it's within us the whole time ratting each
[03:58:13.940 --> 03:58:20.260]  other out videoing putting stuff out there that that gives up a neighbor or
