[01:16.240 --> 01:19.960]  million I saw the number of over 43 million but I guess there's a few
[01:19.960 --> 01:23.020]  million that are only on partial assistance forty one point eight million
[01:23.020 --> 01:28.720]  on full food stamp assistance on their little government-issued credit cards
[01:28.720 --> 01:32.680]  and the government saying hey we're gonna control what kind of food you can

[01:51.960 --> 01:56.680]  society control grid designed by the banks Bernanke finally tells the truth
[01:56.680 --> 02:01.040]  says the United States is on the brink of financial disaster but don't worry the
[02:01.040 --> 02:05.880]  IMF says they've got a quote new world order that's the mainstream news
[02:05.880 --> 02:12.160]  headline a new world order to fix that where you give the banks that have
[02:12.160 --> 02:16.840]  engineered all this crisis even more power they were given more power in
[02:16.840 --> 02:20.680]  October of 08 they were given more power this year with a fellow reserve being
[02:20.680 --> 02:24.200]  given control over the whole economy now they're going to transfer all of that
[02:24.200 --> 02:29.200]  offshore and we will pay our taxes our carbon taxes our value-added taxes and
[02:29.200 --> 02:35.280]  all these other money transfer taxes directly to the criminals but the
[02:35.280 --> 02:38.640]  general public knows all about football and all about sitcoms they don't know
[02:38.640 --> 02:43.000]  about international banking cartels and so we're in a lot of trouble though
[02:43.000 --> 02:50.800]  some people are starting to wake up to this the Republican candidate out in
[02:50.800 --> 02:56.040]  Nevada has pulled ahead of Harry Reid and she talks about fluoride being deadly
[02:56.040 --> 02:59.840]  poison vaccines being dangerous and abolishing the fellow reserve they've
[02:59.840 --> 03:05.200]  tried to script her and cast her as a cook but it isn't working people go
[03:05.200 --> 03:10.840]  wow the mainstream media MSNBC and CNN are calling her a lunatic cook wow I
[03:10.840 --> 03:16.800]  better vote for her oh the media is saying that Rand Paul kidnapped a woman
[03:16.800 --> 03:20.920]  but we better vote for we better vote for him because they're liars and it comes

[03:27.200 --> 03:31.360]  MSNBC is doing hit pieces on Alex Jones at the Southern Prairie Law Center and ADL
[03:31.360 --> 03:37.160]  every month now are saying you know I'm the most dangerous person out there
[03:37.160 --> 03:42.880]  wow people are like we better tune into this Alex Jones immediately if the
[03:42.880 --> 03:47.440]  establishment discredited media is saying he is the second incarnation of
[03:47.440 --> 03:54.720]  L Diablo we've also got again the financial news incredible attacks on the
[03:54.720 --> 03:58.080]  First Amendment I mean it's manifesting even faster than I thought I knew they
[03:58.080 --> 04:03.000]  were gonna do this but to see it actually happening that is an entirely
[04:03.000 --> 04:08.280]  different thing Supreme Court announced yesterday that yeah they're gonna rule
[04:08.280 --> 04:12.600]  they always hint at the end of arguments and when the ruling comes out in the
[04:12.600 --> 04:15.240]  next few months there was wait a few months to release the full write-up
[04:15.240 --> 04:21.640]  that they're gonna restrict protest because of these idiots and I'm gonna
[04:21.640 --> 04:26.160]  say that and I've even interviewed them years ago and I'm all for their First
[04:26.160 --> 04:33.840]  Amendment but they are idiots going out to funerals of dead vets believe me my
[04:33.840 --> 04:36.920]  son had been killed and somebody was coming up screaming at the funeral
[04:36.920 --> 04:39.840]  look you're not gonna have to worry about justice coming because I beat the
[04:39.840 --> 04:46.320]  living daylights out of you I mean I'm sorry but but look I don't want to the
[04:46.320 --> 04:49.640]  point is even though they're idiots you've got to support their free speech
[04:49.640 --> 04:54.640]  and now we're all gonna lose it because the government is using these idiots as
[04:54.640 --> 04:57.520]  a poster child to kill freedom in this country so we're gonna be talking about

[07:15.320 --> 07:19.200]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[07:19.200 --> 07:23.480]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[07:23.480 --> 07:27.640]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[07:27.640 --> 07:31.960]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[07:31.960 --> 07:35.680]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number

[08:00.640 --> 08:09.040]  ease the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[08:09.280 --> 08:15.920]  it is Thursday the 7th day of October 2010 we are going to have first-time
[08:15.920 --> 08:21.040]  calls in the first and second hour Judge Andrew Napolitano the only
[08:21.040 --> 08:26.920]  bonafide real patriot on Fox News will be joining us in the last 30 minutes of
[08:26.920 --> 08:31.600]  the third hour today that should be informative we do have congressman Ron
[08:31.600 --> 08:39.040]  Paul joining us with key information coming up tomorrow we kick off the
[08:39.040 --> 08:43.920]  broadcast also have a video Ron Paul put out we're gonna be playing later in the
[08:43.920 --> 08:51.160]  next hour where he talks about staged you know crises martial law the collapse
[08:51.160 --> 08:55.800]  of society and he's been warning about this for a long time now we are headed
[08:55.800 --> 09:05.760]  into that collapse obviously gold hit 1313 hundred plus dollars 1360 plus
[09:05.760 --> 09:09.840]  dollars today there's been some profit-taking it's gone down about 20
[09:09.840 --> 09:15.640]  dollars will continue to watch that as it continues to unfold crude oil
[09:15.640 --> 09:21.840]  exploding especially in Asia to over eighty four dollars a barrel I knew this
[09:21.840 --> 09:26.880]  was coming because this is the Chicago mafia New York City big city mafia
[09:26.880 --> 09:34.200]  model that was adopted in 1952 by the Pentagon with the annual comprehensive
[09:34.200 --> 09:41.080]  financial reports loan sharking model where Wall Street the CIA that's who
[09:41.080 --> 09:45.520]  set up CIA was Wall Street comes in pays off your city managers gets them to
[09:45.520 --> 09:51.760]  invest most of your tax money off books and then they basically then pay off the
[09:51.760 --> 09:56.920]  politicians with a small part of the profits and then over time get the
[09:56.920 --> 10:05.800]  entire country and every local locality into debt and then they pass bigger
[10:05.800 --> 10:11.240]  packages of socialism to get people more dependent on government so that even
[10:11.240 --> 10:15.200]  if you're mad and angry at the corrupt system and you're living in poverty
[10:15.200 --> 10:21.080]  you're still completely dependent on food medicine medical care security from
[10:21.080 --> 10:27.360]  the mafia itself it's a sharecropping model and it says McDonald's and 29
[10:27.360 --> 10:32.120]  other firms get health care coverage waivers now if you've got a small
[10:32.120 --> 10:37.600]  nursery whether it's a nursery for children or a nursery for plants and
[10:37.600 --> 10:41.640]  say you've got 15 employees you're not going to get the waiver okay they're
[10:41.640 --> 10:45.440]  paid $10 an hour and if you're gonna give them insurance that'll you know
[10:45.440 --> 10:49.400]  basically comes out to about on average about $18 an hour you're just gonna have
[10:49.400 --> 10:54.120]  to lay off 30 40% of your employees to give the other ones the health care and
[10:54.120 --> 10:58.280]  they're gonna have their pay cut as well and have to pay for part of it but
[10:58.280 --> 11:03.080]  tens of thousands of small companies tens of thousands they don't get
[11:03.080 --> 11:08.880]  exemptions info wars.com as this health care comes in isn't gonna get
[11:08.880 --> 11:11.560]  exemptions you know I asked my employees years ago and I asked them again
[11:11.560 --> 11:15.720]  this year I said do you want to get your full paycheck or do you want me to get
[11:15.720 --> 11:19.640]  you health care you're gonna have to pay for half of it that's standard and they
[11:19.640 --> 11:23.940]  said no a lot of them already have their own insurance or they're young and don't
[11:23.940 --> 11:31.120]  want it but that's their choice under this system if it gets put into force in
[11:31.120 --> 11:35.120]  the next few years I don't know what I'm gonna do I mean I mean I'm looking out
[11:35.120 --> 11:38.880]  here at the people that work in my office they're all essential and I'm
[11:38.880 --> 11:44.040]  thinking about hmm I mean I guess I'll just make them take health care in the
[11:44.040 --> 11:49.440]  big pay cut and of course we'll still have to pay Social Security and I've
[11:49.440 --> 11:52.760]  got to match that so they also pull money out of your check for Medicare and
[11:52.760 --> 11:56.240]  Medicaid down the road for Social Security you're never getting and then
[11:56.240 --> 12:00.480]  they've got the regular income taxes on top of it and then they've passed three
[12:00.480 --> 12:06.600]  new city taxes and two new state taxes and I mean it's killing us it's just
[12:06.600 --> 12:10.720]  absolutely people like well just don't pay well folks we have to choose our
[12:10.720 --> 12:13.520]  battles do you know what will happen with the state comptroller if I don't pay
[12:13.520 --> 12:19.280]  all these taxes about ten years ago I was late on just a couple hundred
[12:19.280 --> 12:22.760]  dollar sales tax they done the calculation and they seized my entire bank
[12:22.760 --> 12:27.480]  account just just sees the entire business account and and I mean I'm
[12:27.480 --> 12:32.400]  living in tyranny and it's getting darker the corruption is expanding no
[12:32.400 --> 12:38.960]  one can deny it now and so it's just like when all these globalist firms
[12:38.960 --> 12:44.200]  they're based in Austin for green energy and they are taxing Austinites in the
[12:44.200 --> 12:48.080]  next three years 2.6 billion Austin energy announced to pay for all these
[12:48.080 --> 12:54.520]  new power lines and solar plants and the rest of it it's all sweetheart deals for
[12:54.520 --> 12:58.400]  every job they create with this it costs two jobs conservatively the federal
[12:58.400 --> 13:03.200]  government admits that I've got to pay for all this and it all goes to select
[13:03.200 --> 13:07.160]  corporations and groups and then they're all getting total tax exemption all
[13:07.160 --> 13:11.920]  these companies that have moved to the town where I live they don't have to pay
[13:11.920 --> 13:16.400]  property taxes they don't have to pay all the other city they're just given
[13:16.400 --> 13:21.600]  waivers but not Alex Jones and it's more than tens of thousands of small
[13:21.600 --> 13:27.760]  businesses and I've done the math it's more than a million small businesses in
[13:27.760 --> 13:31.000]  fact guys I saw that a few months ago search the term number of small
[13:31.000 --> 13:34.280]  businesses in US I mean I know it varies depending on how you break it down but I
[13:34.280 --> 13:40.640]  know it's around a million so a million businesses I misspoke and I said tens of
[13:40.640 --> 13:46.120]  thousands hundreds of thousands conservatively of businesses don't get
[13:46.120 --> 13:51.920]  any of these exemptions but McDonald's and 29 other firms get health care
[13:51.920 --> 13:56.160]  coverage waivers look you don't have to do it and I said this was gonna happen
[13:56.160 --> 14:00.480]  because I read the bill but but go back to last year with the automaker bailouts
[14:00.480 --> 14:06.600]  which with the General Motors bailout 30 plus billion went to them overall in
[14:06.600 --> 14:11.240]  the two different bailouts it was a billion and a half to move a plant from
[14:11.240 --> 14:17.120]  Michigan to Brazil two billion dollars to move one to Eastern Europe a couple
[14:17.120 --> 14:21.800]  billion to move a plant to China I mean you can search the term bailout auto
[14:21.800 --> 14:29.000]  bailout money used to move plants outside US so my tax money this is the new
[14:29.000 --> 14:35.120]  world order just just naked insane absurdist ridiculous corruption I mean
[14:35.120 --> 14:38.840]  what country in its right mind if it wasn't run by total swindling crooks
[14:38.840 --> 14:42.280]  that are basically engaged in a corporate breakup of the nation so they
[14:42.280 --> 14:45.680]  can consolidate it for pennies on the dollar they want to wreck it so they
[14:45.680 --> 14:49.440]  can buy it up for pennies on the dollar and they've got all the neocons up there
[14:49.440 --> 14:52.680]  now admitting the government wants to destroy things by design but claiming
[14:52.680 --> 14:58.680]  because Obama is you know anti-colonialist and wants to destroy America this
[14:58.680 --> 15:04.520]  process began way before Bill Clinton even this is globalism this is NAFTA and
[15:04.520 --> 15:09.880]  GATT this is what Republicans have supported as well don't ever forget
[15:09.880 --> 15:15.600]  that and as distasteful as people like Van Jones and Cass Sunstein are they
[15:15.600 --> 15:19.760]  are mid-level operatives they are not at the top of the pyramid they are not
[15:19.760 --> 15:23.640]  giving a shot of the chessboard over here they are not the Kings and the
[15:23.640 --> 15:29.840]  Queens they are not the Rooks they are not the Knights they are not the bishops
[15:29.840 --> 15:35.800]  okay they're not even pawns ladies and gentlemen I mean Cass Sunstein might
[15:35.800 --> 15:42.440]  make up one one hundredth of this pawn all of Cass Sunstein's evil operations
[15:42.440 --> 15:50.360]  on a chessboard in the enemy army he might make up one one hundredth of a pawn
[15:50.360 --> 15:55.640]  okay now you talk about the Rothschilds the Rockefellers the Saxe-Coburg
[15:55.640 --> 16:03.480]  Gothas the Dutch royalty they make up a king all of them together make up a king
[16:03.480 --> 16:08.560]  on the chessboard but I watch Glenn Beck he sits up there and tells you that Van
[16:08.560 --> 16:14.640]  Jones is a knight he tells you Cass Sunstein is a king and he tells you
[16:14.640 --> 16:18.720]  they're communist well they are communist but but not in the way the
[16:18.720 --> 16:23.520]  general public knows communism communism isn't a bunch of dirty hippies you know
[16:23.520 --> 16:27.560]  running around with machine guns it's always financed by big mega banks in
[16:27.560 --> 16:34.840]  1917 in Russia in 1949 in China as Carol Quigley the historian for the CFR
[16:34.840 --> 16:40.880]  and CIA Bill Clinton's mentor wrote anything that consolidates power anything
[16:40.880 --> 16:46.800]  that creates tyranny and a vertical integration the globalist supported okay
[16:46.800 --> 16:50.800]  now I do have to say on the Beck issue we were monitoring last night and I left
[16:50.800 --> 16:53.120]  here and Aaron said he was going to have it I don't know if you put it on the
[16:53.120 --> 16:57.800]  i omega computer but you guys might want to check this it's a clip of Glenn Beck
[16:57.800 --> 17:02.360]  last night saying that the Fabian socialists wanted to poison the water
[17:02.360 --> 17:07.720]  to sterilize you and I've been begging him to do that we look I don't trust him
[17:07.720 --> 17:11.920]  don't like him but I said when he gets better and tells the truth we will
[17:11.920 --> 17:15.760]  support what he says that is true we will point out what he says that is a
[17:15.760 --> 17:20.280]  distortion or a limited hangout or blaming it on patsies or low-level
[17:20.280 --> 17:25.520]  minions but that's a big step okay that Glenn Beck is now because these are the
[17:25.520 --> 17:30.120]  quotes these are the plans remember Nightline was like Alex Jones is some
[17:30.120 --> 17:34.400]  type of dangerous lunatic and groups that monitor extremists are extremely
[17:34.400 --> 17:37.760]  concerned about him because he's the biggest and the baddest and the most
[17:37.760 --> 17:41.520]  dangerous and you know if you stand on a street corner and say the government's
[17:41.520 --> 17:44.880]  putting stuff in the water to sterilize you you'd be laughed at but when you do
[17:44.880 --> 17:50.040]  it on the radio you got a million listeners every day well all I'm doing
[17:50.040 --> 17:58.680]  is reading eco science by the White House Science Zone himself upon all I'm
[17:58.680 --> 18:02.520]  doing is reading what Bertrand Russell said all I'm doing is reading what Shaw
[18:02.520 --> 18:07.520]  said all I'm doing is what reading what the UN said I mean literally literally
[18:07.520 --> 18:12.520]  hundreds of mainstream news articles in the last six months calling for adding
[18:12.520 --> 18:17.400]  things to the water to reduce fertility hundreds of articles calling for forced
[18:17.400 --> 18:22.160]  inoculations to reduce fertility hundreds of articles calling for taxes on
[18:22.160 --> 18:26.160]  people that have children hundreds of articles calling for a global tyranny
[18:26.160 --> 18:30.480]  they call it eco fascism and they they call them they call it that themselves
[18:30.480 --> 18:36.640]  London Guardian you name it and say it's good we need it so all I'm not the
[18:36.640 --> 18:41.120]  lunatic I know this stuff is crazy sounding but I'm the one reporting on
[18:41.120 --> 18:45.440]  what they're saying they are the lunatics they are the dangerous people
[18:45.440 --> 18:50.040]  you know when I read an operation north woods which the Pentagon green-lighted to
[18:50.040 --> 18:53.800]  stage it bombings shootings and hijackings and crashing of jets by
[18:53.800 --> 18:57.760]  remote control to blame it on foreign enemies yeah it sounds crazy to be
[18:57.760 --> 19:03.160]  reading that on air but it's ABC news it's Baltimore Sun it's the declassified
[19:03.160 --> 19:06.560]  document what am I just supposed to oh you know what we're not going to cover
[19:06.560 --> 19:09.160]  this but but getting back to the main issue that I was starting to get into
[19:09.160 --> 19:17.080]  here just like with the bailouts of the cars the money was given to transfer the
[19:17.080 --> 19:22.760]  industry overseas and it came out in Congress that anybody who'd given big
[19:22.760 --> 19:26.320]  money to Democrats who own dealerships some of them that have been around for
[19:26.320 --> 19:30.080]  over 80 years and were worth tens of millions of dollars a year they were
[19:30.080 --> 19:36.600]  allowed to keep their franchise but those that didn't the Obama people
[19:36.600 --> 19:41.000]  district by district literally with the Congress people acting like mafia pimps
[19:41.000 --> 19:45.320]  would take the dealership away and give it to one of their other operatives I
[19:45.320 --> 19:50.240]  mean that's hardcore mafia racketeering out in the open well here it is on
[19:50.240 --> 19:57.080]  healthcare McDonald's and 29 other firms are exempt they don't have to pay or

[24:48.240 --> 24:54.560]  presence he of course admitted that four months ago but the public is waking up
[24:54.560 --> 24:59.640]  but not really to the full horror I mean it's taken me 17 years of deep research
[24:59.640 --> 25:05.720]  15 years on air to really get a basic grasp of the full spectrum that we're
[25:05.720 --> 25:11.240]  facing and let me tell you it is indescribably hardcore indescribably real
[25:11.240 --> 25:18.680]  and serious and bonafide we are living in a system run by ruthless mass
[25:18.680 --> 25:25.480]  murdering control freak killers who are committing crime everywhere naked body
[25:25.480 --> 25:31.320]  scanners mobile scanners frying your house and the operators du with the
[25:31.320 --> 25:39.640]  troops you know trillion stolen by the banks false flag terror the Obama
[25:39.640 --> 25:44.480]  administration I mean that's bold to take hundreds of dealerships from
[25:44.480 --> 25:51.160]  Republican donors as part of a political war I mean that is so criminal and it's
[25:51.160 --> 25:58.120]  so criminal with selective enforcement to give 30 waivers McDonald's and 29 other
[25:58.120 --> 26:03.360]  firms get health care coverage waivers and they pulled up the numbers from the
[26:03.360 --> 26:10.720]  National Association of Small Businesses it was what was it 20s how many
[26:10.720 --> 26:16.560]  million 29.6 million small businesses so I was way off the mark I knew it was in
[26:16.560 --> 26:24.840]  the millions 29 plus million small businesses you don't get this health
[26:24.840 --> 26:32.080]  care tax exemption but the big mega corporations like McDonald's and Jack in
[26:32.080 --> 26:42.320]  the box and 28 other major companies they get the waiver they don't have to get
[26:42.320 --> 26:46.320]  insurance for their employees because it would shut down the fast food industry
[26:46.320 --> 26:51.080]  what the average pays about 10 bucks an hour can you imagine if they had to give
[26:51.080 --> 26:55.800]  them health care coverage on average it probably add five six dollars you know
[26:55.800 --> 26:59.200]  to their pay and and what are those companies going to do they're going to
[26:59.200 --> 27:03.360]  take it out of the pay at least part of it of their employees and so how are the
[27:03.360 --> 27:07.280]  employees going to live on six dollars an hour how are you going to do that how
[27:07.280 --> 27:12.320]  are you going to you it's hard to live on ten dollars an hour how are you going
[27:12.320 --> 27:16.920]  to do that well you're you're not the economy is going to implode meanwhile we
[27:16.920 --> 27:21.600]  got 40 million illegals it's well over 30 million 35 40 million illegal aliens
[27:21.600 --> 27:26.640]  the government inmates 20 million all getting free health care the all of the
[27:26.640 --> 27:32.440]  major border states are in a state of bankruptcy or going into bankruptcy and
[27:32.440 --> 27:38.040]  there's more unfunded mandates and more corruption and meanwhile they're about
[27:38.040 --> 27:42.160]  to get rid of their conservative and name only Arnold Schwarzenegger in
[27:42.160 --> 27:48.880]  California and probably gonna elect mr. Brown who's about as socialist as it
[27:48.880 --> 27:53.080]  gets oh I mean what's gonna happen to California it's a beautiful state a lot
[27:53.080 --> 28:00.840]  of great people a what's gonna happen to California where is all of this going
[28:00.840 --> 28:06.160]  to end so I want to get more into the economy later I've got a clip of Ron
[28:06.160 --> 28:12.800]  Paul where he talks about when the economy collapses false flag etc very
[28:12.800 --> 28:16.280]  very powerful a video clip from Ron Paul is getting more and more bold a few
[28:16.280 --> 28:19.880]  months ago he came out and said there's been a coup in this country the CIA runs
[28:19.880 --> 28:23.440]  the nation and they're shipping in the drugs and he was given thunderous
[28:23.440 --> 28:30.160]  applause just like he was given thunderous applause and won the major
[28:30.160 --> 28:38.120]  Republican straw poll at CPAC the system is scared because mainline
[28:38.120 --> 28:43.960]  Republicans are starting to wake up and by the way Aaron did get the clip last
[28:43.960 --> 28:48.600]  night from Glenn Beckham to play it in the next hour where he talks about the
[28:48.600 --> 28:55.560]  Fabian socialist wanted to poison your water to sterilize you I mean wow people
[28:55.560 --> 28:59.440]  you get confused they say well are you bashing back or are you praising him I'm
[28:59.440 --> 29:03.600]  bashing him when he gives you disinformation or twisted info and
[29:03.600 --> 29:08.480]  I'm saying this is true this is good when he does the right thing and he's going
[29:08.480 --> 29:12.360]  in a better direction I'm not endorsing Glenn Beck I don't trust him I want to
[29:12.360 --> 29:15.560]  be clear about that people like well why are you talking about Glenn Beck well
[29:15.560 --> 29:20.800]  because he's co-opted much of the true patriot movement and I don't trust Fox
[29:20.800 --> 29:25.400]  News and he's being set up as the leader by the control corporate media to
[29:25.400 --> 29:28.840]  later be destroyed and so he's a very important figure and we're talking about
[29:28.840 --> 29:34.800]  it all right but side issue when I get back we're gonna get into the massive
[29:34.800 --> 29:39.920]  attack on the First Amendment that is out in the open now we're gonna get into
[29:39.920 --> 29:43.760]  the latest developments with the shooting of this man with his wife out on
[29:43.760 --> 29:48.560]  the jet ski on a lake bordering Mexico in South Texas that's coming up as well

[34:21.960 --> 34:26.160]  event for 800 with $100 tickets but I don't do it Glenn Beck does I told the
[34:26.160 --> 34:29.760]  great folks out there and they agreed that I'd almost do it free but we
[34:29.760 --> 34:33.360]  couldn't get any of the city centers on the days I was going out there and it's
[34:33.360 --> 34:36.720]  not fair to the station to have to pay for it so we're basically just doing it
[34:36.720 --> 34:42.440]  for cost I hope folks appreciate that I guess they did it sold out 800 tickets
[34:42.440 --> 34:50.680]  gone and so mz has the facilities at k s c o a m they're in Santa Cruz blasting
[34:50.680 --> 34:57.120]  into San Francisco we're also on another station he owns in the area but
[34:57.120 --> 35:03.440]  we're going to be having an event on Monday now at the coconut grove as well
[35:03.440 --> 35:07.560]  so it'll be Sunday 6 o'clock Monday 7 o'clock and I fly out the next morning
[35:07.560 --> 35:12.360]  and I'll be able to do my radio broadcast live from the k s c o a m 10
[35:12.360 --> 35:22.240]  80 studios so I'll be live on that Monday the 25th of October 2010 in the
[35:22.240 --> 35:28.120]  next few hours they're going to get the second ticket offering up at ksco.com
[35:28.120 --> 35:33.120]  and the 800 tickets will undoubtedly probably sell out by early next week
[35:33.120 --> 35:38.880]  they might even sell out in a day I've only plugged this three times and it's
[35:38.880 --> 35:43.720]  sold out and I've pointed out you know we've had events with 1200 1400 people
[35:43.720 --> 35:49.120]  where we turned away 600 people and so if you want to get those tickets I get
[35:49.120 --> 35:55.480]  them quickly continuing here we are carrying the new video what in the
[35:55.480 --> 35:59.080]  world are they spring an excellent film on chemtrails the first film to come
[35:59.080 --> 36:03.360]  out since they've admitted that chemtrails are part of a aerosol spring
[36:03.360 --> 36:06.760]  campaign to quote protect us from global warming that's obviously a cover
[36:06.760 --> 36:11.960]  story it's very toxic this film is very important it ships October 22nd and if
[36:11.960 --> 36:15.840]  you want to get it first order it at info wars.com today and they will ship
[36:15.840 --> 36:20.280]  out in the order that they are received and your purchase of the film
[36:20.280 --> 36:27.080]  supports us Angie Edward Griffin so again info wars.com or 888-253-3139 I
[36:27.080 --> 36:30.200]  told them last week to take the special down but they've been so busy they
[36:30.200 --> 36:34.760]  haven't done it but I'm gonna have it taken down by tomorrow where you get a
[36:34.760 --> 36:39.920]  Obama deception film for 1995 and get a free copy of Jesse Ventura's excellent
[36:39.920 --> 36:45.080]  book American conspiracies we're also over the weekend gonna end the special
[36:45.080 --> 36:50.640]  for four copies of Endgame for the price of one 1995 Endgame blueprint for
[36:50.640 --> 36:54.240]  global enslavement what I think is my most important and overall film that
[36:54.240 --> 36:57.920]  covers their entire agenda you can give this film to anybody if they'll watch
[36:57.920 --> 37:02.280]  the three hours they will certainly have a first-rate understanding and it's
[37:02.280 --> 37:07.080]  all documented there's an online website what is the endgame.com that has a
[37:07.080 --> 37:11.760]  full online bibliography of every document every video clip every news
[37:11.760 --> 37:16.240]  item we show you is all linked or posted there at what is the endgame.com
[37:16.240 --> 37:20.120]  you can say here's the video everything in it you can you know stop it and pause
[37:20.120 --> 37:24.960]  it and Google whatever Alex is talking about or whatever he's showing but you
[37:24.960 --> 37:28.880]  can also go to what is the endgame.com and it's got a in fact most of the
[37:28.880 --> 37:32.760]  films now I have these online bibliographies we don't have the time
[37:32.760 --> 37:37.480]  energy your staff to do it it's it's it's been volunteers have just done it
[37:37.480 --> 37:41.320]  and every time it's an excellent breakdown they go look at my film they
[37:41.320 --> 37:44.800]  check all the research they find the links they send us the links and we
[37:44.800 --> 37:52.120]  build the site the first film we did that with was 9-1-1 rise of the police
[37:52.120 --> 37:58.600]  state 2005 but since then terror storm Obama deception fall the republic they
[37:58.600 --> 38:04.400]  all have what we call a lot of times basically a viewing guide with the
[38:04.400 --> 38:12.320]  films and and so many people if you said hey here's a movie that shows how
[38:12.320 --> 38:15.160]  they're putting poison in your drinking water and doing secret experiments on
[38:15.160 --> 38:20.120]  you and why they're doing it people laugh at you but but now because it's it
[38:20.120 --> 38:24.720]  the the the socialist and the globalist and the environmentalist are openly
[38:24.720 --> 38:29.120]  promoting it people are now listening and now because becks covering it people
[38:29.120 --> 38:34.320]  are listening well it's time to help help folks graduate from from baby rice
[38:34.320 --> 38:45.800]  cereal known as pap to giant 45 ounce t-bone steak okay this is not for babies
[38:45.800 --> 38:52.080]  in game blueprint for global enslavement what's it say on the back they want you
[38:52.080 --> 38:58.640]  dead they want you dead okay not my words there's this isn't a game you have
[38:58.640 --> 39:03.080]  children you care about them you need to find out about this okay this isn't a
[39:03.080 --> 39:09.760]  joke this isn't a game we're playing up here this is real do you think I could
[39:09.760 --> 39:13.760]  be on all these AM and FM stations and global shortwave satellite you name it
[39:13.760 --> 39:19.280]  and and and be saying bear pharmaceuticals knowingly shipped out over a
[39:19.280 --> 39:23.960]  million ampoules of factor a knowing it had HIV and hepatitis in it and it came
[39:23.960 --> 39:28.880]  out in court documents in France where they got convicted that they knowingly
[39:28.880 --> 39:32.280]  did it it wasn't it was a mistake or they didn't care or they just wanted
[39:32.280 --> 39:36.520]  profits they did it they knew and they did it because they wanted to reduce
[39:36.520 --> 39:40.000]  population you think I'd get away with that for ten minutes if it wasn't true
[39:40.000 --> 39:44.680]  now I've got MSNBC and Reuters admitting it as well but the point is it
[39:44.680 --> 39:49.400]  sounds crazy but if you won't go check it out and find out I'm telling you the
[39:49.400 --> 39:55.440]  truth you can just search the term MSNBC Bayer blood scandal and you'll get
[39:55.440 --> 40:00.280]  clips or you'll get news articles but a lot of you won't go check it out you
[40:00.280 --> 40:04.360]  just say that guy's nuts there's no way that's true there's no way do you the
[40:04.360 --> 40:06.720]  government knows it's gonna kill the troops and give them cancer and birth
[40:06.720 --> 40:09.920]  defects in their children when we have their own reports the former head of the
[40:09.920 --> 40:15.240]  DU program on well instead of just saying I'm crazy go look it up or even if
[40:15.240 --> 40:21.280]  you're lazy and won't do that understand this I would be sued into oblivion if I
[40:21.280 --> 40:24.720]  got up here and said that about bear pharmaceuticals and it wasn't true I would
[40:24.720 --> 40:28.440]  be sued in I've been saying it for many years before it was mainstream news we
[40:28.440 --> 40:32.000]  had medical doctors and scientists on about it one medical doctor up in
[40:32.000 --> 40:35.800]  Arkansas had exposed it Clinton was involved in it and they fire bombed his
[40:35.800 --> 40:40.960]  clinic I mean and I called him back to get him on and he just said look I'm done
[40:40.960 --> 40:45.680]  talking I've been fire bombed and the same night they fire bombed the hemophiliac
[40:45.680 --> 40:50.440]  Society of Canada because they were involved in the lawsuits 10 years ago to
[40:50.440 --> 40:55.120]  expose this they were exposing this we're going back 15 years and then 10
[40:55.120 --> 40:58.360]  years ago and it was only the last four years that finally it broke into
[40:58.360 --> 41:02.260]  mainstream media but the the firebombing didn't cover it up the
[41:02.260 --> 41:07.900]  intimidation didn't cover it up you know I get death-threatened when I talk
[41:07.900 --> 41:11.280]  about Dinecore running child kidnapping rings I mean it's in the Chicago Tribune
[41:11.280 --> 41:15.480]  I'm gonna cover it and I'm not gonna shut up when I get death-threaded okay I'm
[41:15.480 --> 41:21.560]  committed I'm not backing off but but the issue here is this is real they shot
[41:21.560 --> 41:26.000]  up children and men and women in Guatemala a US government program telling
[41:26.000 --> 41:30.640]  them they were getting vaccines with syphilis I told you that was a worldwide
[41:30.640 --> 41:36.160]  program with the syphilis they put SV 40 high-powered cancer virus that the
[41:36.160 --> 41:40.320]  government admits gave hundreds of millions of Americans since the 50s
[41:40.320 --> 41:46.720]  cancers that were unknown or rare are now widespread and SV 40 is communicable
[41:46.720 --> 41:52.120]  almost the entire population of the world now has SV 40 in them it's a bio
[41:52.120 --> 41:58.200]  engineered cancer virus in 1910 through the 1930s we've got the Rockefeller
[41:58.200 --> 42:02.320]  Foundation documents we've linked them in the films on the websites info wars
[42:02.320 --> 42:06.760]  dot com present body calm where they discovered this they bought up the
[42:06.760 --> 42:11.200]  hospitals they control the patents on most cancer treatment that's why they
[42:11.200 --> 42:15.960]  won't let real alternative mainline medical treatments be used because they
[42:15.960 --> 42:21.700]  won't let you they make the money they soft kill you and then suck all you the
[42:21.700 --> 42:33.440]  money out of you as you die remember that the head of the FBI G Edgar Hoover in
[42:33.440 --> 42:37.840]  the 50s testified before Congress in the early 50s and said La Cosa Nostra
[42:37.840 --> 42:43.800]  didn't exist now you know that's ridiculous the mafia exist and the
[42:43.800 --> 42:47.360]  media is telling you for decades there's no world government big banks don't run
[42:47.360 --> 42:51.000]  it there's no plan for a carbon tax now you know they were stalling you they
[42:51.000 --> 42:54.900]  were lying to you and now we're at the point of the global collapse by design
[42:54.900 --> 42:59.040]  with socialist government-run health care with death panels now admitted in the
[42:59.040 --> 43:03.060]  bill now law Bill Gates telling you how great it is see to get it past they
[43:03.060 --> 43:06.060]  lied and said it wasn't there but we could read the section and there it was
[43:06.060 --> 43:10.500]  they'd say shut up liars and now they've got it past they've got to implement
[43:10.500 --> 43:14.940]  they go actually there are death panels but it's good for you and they play the
[43:14.940 --> 43:20.380]  population off against themselves oh you know we can hire 10 teachers if we
[43:20.380 --> 43:25.920]  don't give grandma treatment for cancer to try to get 10 teachers you know to
[43:25.920 --> 43:29.640]  get the teachers out there listening the millions of teachers to think wow I'll
[43:29.640 --> 43:34.720]  get a job I'll get a raise if I sign on to blood thirsty eugenics your it's you
[43:34.720 --> 43:39.480]  teachers in 20 years or 10 years when you need medical care or next month when
[43:39.480 --> 43:43.600]  you get diagnosed with breast cancer at 45 it you're the one that's gonna have
[43:43.600 --> 43:49.040]  the death panel say no do you understand that even if you're a blood thirsty
[43:49.040 --> 43:53.920]  parasite who believes that the globalist are gonna kill granny and give you
[43:53.920 --> 43:58.660]  some money are you that stupid they don't want to just kill granny lady they
[43:58.660 --> 44:06.440]  want to kill you you got it I hope you got it I hope you got it real good you
[44:06.440 --> 44:10.000]  think I just get up here and say every major vaccine that's been tested over and
[44:10.000 --> 44:15.600]  over again has been found with designer RNA cancer viruses that plug into your
[44:15.600 --> 44:22.920]  DNA you think cancers up over 3,000% on average in the Western world because the
[44:22.920 --> 44:26.440]  Easter Bunny is going around at night climbing up on your bed and shooting you
[44:26.440 --> 44:31.520]  up with it no you think I could get up here for 10 minutes and tell you don't
[44:31.520 --> 44:35.400]  take the H1N1 shot because it'll cause major brain damage without having top
[44:35.400 --> 44:39.080]  scientists on and show what the trials did you think I can get up here and tell
[44:39.080 --> 44:42.420]  you it destroys your immunity and more than doubles your chances of getting a
[44:42.420 --> 44:47.560]  regular flu and dying from it that's four different studies Canada the US
[44:47.560 --> 44:52.680]  Germany China there's more than that that was just the one headline I saw last
[44:52.680 --> 44:55.360]  year with all the medical studies in fact people won't believe it search the
[44:55.360 --> 45:07.480]  term right now this is key H1N1 vaccine doubles chances to get regular flu or
[45:07.480 --> 45:13.720]  more than doubles and you'll get CBC was the first clip that came up a week ago
[45:13.720 --> 45:16.360]  when I was researching it for a film I'm doing even though I'd already done the
[45:16.360 --> 45:19.720]  research you got to go from memory make sure you're right and pull it up it's
[45:19.720 --> 45:23.520]  just always double-checking triple-checking all the research we've done all the
[45:23.520 --> 45:29.720]  thousands and thousands of data points and information that we've been
[45:29.720 --> 45:37.440]  covering here on this broadcast but yes you have a government so evil that by
[45:37.440 --> 45:43.160]  the early 1950s and I've got a video by one of the vaccine developers in
[45:43.160 --> 45:47.360]  Canada on Kennedy and TV laughing about how they knew it had the cancer virus
[45:47.360 --> 45:50.840]  Senate we've played that before I'd like to see Glenn Beck play that maybe he
[45:50.840 --> 45:55.920]  will next week I know the exact video clips we played four years ago on the
[45:55.920 --> 46:02.560]  show last year on the show this year in the show that we source in in-game that
[46:02.560 --> 46:06.280]  in the eugenics film I've been working on for more than two years it's the very
[46:06.280 --> 46:11.680]  clips that Glenn Beck played last night are in the eugenics film that's more
[46:11.680 --> 46:19.840]  than half finished two years of intense work on this and it's so powerful that
[46:19.840 --> 46:26.080]  I just can't release it yet it's there's so much new stuff coming out there it is
[46:26.080 --> 46:32.600]  seasonal flu shot may increase H1N1 risk yeah that's CBC but that's another
[46:32.600 --> 46:37.880]  study about how those regular seasonal flu shot increases there'll be another
[46:37.880 --> 46:43.880]  one with other studies about the H1N1 doubling the contraction of the
[46:43.880 --> 46:49.160]  seasonal so it's vice versa because the truth is vaccines lower your immunity
[46:49.160 --> 46:53.920]  they are not a full bore virus and so your body learns to see it is not so
[46:53.920 --> 46:58.200]  much of a threat that's what the studies show and so when you get hit with a real
[46:58.200 --> 47:05.080]  virus a wild virus or a man-made virus now you're gonna you're gonna get real
[47:05.080 --> 47:14.600]  sick you're gonna get real sick and that's why our immunity I mean it's like
[47:14.600 --> 47:18.680]  all these big studies about hand sanitizers linked to cancer and reduced
[47:18.680 --> 47:24.480]  immunity absolutely people that have worked in barnyards people that have
[47:24.480 --> 47:30.120]  worked in gardens people that have they've done studies of trash truck people
[47:30.120 --> 47:33.800]  you know trash men you can pull those up they have some of the highest
[47:33.800 --> 47:37.520]  immunities and some of the lowest levels of disease why because they're
[47:37.520 --> 47:41.640]  knee-deep and garbage ladies and gentlemen they're neat in the body goes
[47:41.640 --> 47:48.200]  man I am in a filthy environment I better buck up I better gear up but your
[47:48.200 --> 47:52.440]  bubble boy getting hundreds of vaccines by the time you're ten years old your
[47:52.440 --> 47:58.360]  bubble girl you're drinking all this GMO milk eating GMO food mommy doesn't let
[47:58.360 --> 48:04.520]  you go out and dig in the dirt all you're eating processed foods I mean you
[48:04.520 --> 48:11.680]  are a wreck you are a wreck and it's been estimated by scientific studies that we
[48:11.680 --> 48:16.280]  all get cancer every day even when we're young by the time we're old we're
[48:16.280 --> 48:21.400]  we're contracting cancer you know it's developing the body hundreds of times
[48:21.400 --> 48:26.400]  a day in studies but your body beats it all day long that's another issue you
[48:26.400 --> 48:30.920]  start suppressing and confusing the immune system you're like well Alex why
[48:30.920 --> 48:35.400]  would a trash truck driver or a doctor have such high immunity because they're
[48:35.400 --> 48:40.240]  around bacteria and viruses all day but then why would a vaccine then have the
[48:40.240 --> 48:45.880]  opposite effect because when you're a doctor or you're a trash truck driver
[48:45.880 --> 48:51.120]  you're not injecting the blood and the viruses and the bacteria through your
[48:51.120 --> 48:58.440]  defense system you are it's going into your sinuses it's it's going into your
[48:58.440 --> 49:03.320]  eyes it's going into your mouth that's why sexually transmitted diseases are so
[49:03.320 --> 49:07.040]  dangerous because they're getting past your defenses that's why people that have
[49:07.040 --> 49:12.800]  unnatural sex transmit diseases so much whether they be male or female because
[49:12.800 --> 49:18.400]  that isn't designed for it and there's no defenses it goes right into you but
[49:18.400 --> 49:23.160]  when it goes into the sinus or the eyes or the mouth the body's geared up it's
[49:23.160 --> 49:27.280]  got its special forces white blood cell commanders the T lymphocytes and others
[49:27.280 --> 49:31.040]  they're all there and then you know the crack frontline troops are there and
[49:31.040 --> 49:34.840]  they're assessing look at this I deal with it take it out got another one take
[49:34.840 --> 49:39.080]  it out because the body's designed to have it on the skin the bacteria the
[49:39.080 --> 49:45.400]  viruses everything else the toxins and the body's designed to deal with that on
[49:45.400 --> 49:49.680]  the skin the mucous membranes it's not designed with your little newborn baby
[49:49.680 --> 49:54.000]  with them to come in with six different shots with huge ampoules filled with
[49:54.000 --> 50:00.960]  mercury aluminum RNA you know you name it chemicals and just pumping the baby
[50:00.960 --> 50:06.720]  just pumping the baby full of all of this directly through its defenses right
[50:06.720 --> 50:11.560]  into its muscles right into its bloodstream it doesn't know how to
[50:11.560 --> 50:16.360]  handle it it can't handle it and then mama does something even worse she
[50:16.360 --> 50:20.040]  doesn't breastfeed the baby I'm not judging if you didn't I'm just educating

[54:39.360 --> 54:47.200]  affect the internet if you offend someone they can sue you and that ties

[55:12.880 --> 55:17.080]  paralyze you with political correctness that's coming up but I promise to go to
[55:17.080 --> 55:20.720]  calls so I want to go to Mark and Dorothy and Paul and Alex and Michael and
[55:20.720 --> 55:26.200]  Tonya and others that are patiently holding I've got a bunch of other news
[55:26.200 --> 55:29.880]  as well and some key video clips are going to be playing where Beck admits
[55:29.880 --> 55:32.560]  that they want to poison the water well they don't want to poison the water
[55:32.560 --> 55:38.600]  they're doing it Jack okay so we're going to be talking about that as well
[55:38.600 --> 55:45.880]  but but just putting in bookend on what I was talking about with milk
[55:45.880 --> 55:50.960]  colostrum in the first few weeks especially is filled with all the
[55:50.960 --> 55:54.920]  mother's immunity when the baby starts growing on the placenta in the uterus
[55:54.920 --> 56:00.720]  the placenta is literally a complex filter to block that's why many women
[56:00.720 --> 56:07.040]  can have HIV or other diseases and it's not passed on to the baby because the
[56:07.040 --> 56:11.360]  body is shielding it from any diseases the mother may have that's why they've
[56:11.360 --> 56:15.560]  got those parasites that cats cover that the cats can have that end up getting
[56:15.560 --> 56:18.400]  into the placenta going through it getting into the baby but there's not
[56:18.400 --> 56:21.480]  many things that can get through the placenta then the baby comes out fresh
[56:21.480 --> 56:29.000]  and new and healthy as pure as the driven snow mommy then gives milk to the
[56:29.000 --> 56:34.760]  baby full of protein and fats and natural sugars and it's filled with
[56:34.760 --> 56:41.880]  every immunity in her entire genetic line I mean it's just off the charts what
[56:41.880 --> 56:49.680]  is in colostrum off the charts what is being transferred as an immunity in fact
[56:49.680 --> 56:53.920]  if you go back to the Japanese or even the Middle Ages in Europe or before that
[56:53.920 --> 56:57.360]  of the Egyptians one of the things that the elite would drink when they were
[56:57.360 --> 57:04.120]  sick is they would have nursemaids who would you know take care of their babies
[57:04.120 --> 57:07.400]  who were just basically constantly producing milk almost like a milk cow
[57:07.400 --> 57:10.200]  for the elite's children so they wouldn't have to breastfeed but they would
[57:10.200 --> 57:16.480]  have special ones who were timed to have a baby themselves where they had a
[57:16.480 --> 57:21.000]  whole basically a stable of these women so they would always have a woman who
[57:21.000 --> 57:25.080]  was just about to give birth or who had just given birth to get that I mean they
[57:25.080 --> 57:29.800]  knew thousands of years ago that milk coming out of a woman who just had a
[57:29.800 --> 57:39.280]  baby is gold for health it's a natural vaccine it's a natural immunity booster
[57:39.280 --> 57:42.840]  and all the major studies you can pull these up show that women are harder
[57:42.840 --> 57:47.800]  here than men that's why they live longer women have higher tolerances to
[57:47.800 --> 57:52.720]  every disease known women are tough stuff ladies and gentlemen because they
[57:52.720 --> 57:57.720]  are designed to create life they are designed to grow it they are designed to
[57:57.720 --> 58:03.960]  take care of it women are just just just just boiling with power boiling with
[58:03.960 --> 58:08.840]  life force and energy okay but instead the baby is shot up with a bunch of
[58:08.840 --> 58:18.840]  shots and then formula that's 40 plus percent corn syrup high fructose corn
[58:18.840 --> 58:24.440]  syrup and 10 percent regular sugar that's what's given to the baby and they
[58:24.440 --> 58:28.160]  convince women it's high tech it's buck Rogers it's science give your baby this
[58:28.160 --> 58:32.320]  and then all the studies show babies who are not breastfed have smaller cc size
[58:32.320 --> 58:36.720]  brains the baby needs your milk this has been a public service announcement
[58:36.720 --> 58:40.000]  we'll be right back with your phone calls

[59:02.280 --> 59:06.560]  from underneath the Americans at home I've turned menace influence on our
[59:06.560 --> 59:10.760]  president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I think it's
[59:10.760 --> 59:16.000]  incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for the
[59:16.000 --> 59:20.560]  Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal off-short cartel

[01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:12.520]  okay well i just started with listening to you about a week ago so i'm kind of
[01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:17.160]  nervous i already have my passport and was wondering if i should stay in the
[01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:21.400]  united states or try to move somewhere else i was thinking switzerland or new
[01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:24.720]  zealand and i was wondering what you thought about that and i just started
[01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:31.440]  doing research do you have three million dollars no what's our ones not gonna
[01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:39.120]  let you in do you have do you have half a million no then news it's gonna be hard
[01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:42.480]  to get into new zealand you can you can do it with 300 000 but then they want to
[01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:46.200]  know that once you do that that you're gonna be able to be self-supported once
[01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:48.920]  you get there so you don't get on their welfare and bankrupt them like the
[01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:52.720]  illegal aliens are doing to this country no one else puts up with this but the
[01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:56.880]  globalist have destined us to be destroyed but there's nowhere to really
[01:01:56.880 --> 01:02:00.960]  run we stand and we fight the united states is still one of the best countries
[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:06.240]  in the world and it this is a global corporate tyranny everything you see
[01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:13.120]  happening here is happening to the same degree or worse or worse than the united
[01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:16.120]  states i can't tell you how many thousands of people i've talked to and
[01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:19.680]  hundreds of people i know personally you know who go to other countries that
[01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:23.080]  are supposedly even good and they're hellish new zealand is probably the
[01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:27.000]  best if you're wanting to just get away from this but they're putting in the
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:33.440]  whole same system so i mean this is a world government this is a new world
[01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:39.920]  order this is global governance so we've we've got a stand and fight awesome i
[01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:43.400]  just wanted to get your opinion see what you thought well i appreciate your
[01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:46.800]  call i mean the only way to leave the country is if you're fleeing some false
[01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:55.080]  charges or if you're a public figure who you know is going to be exterminated
[01:02:55.080 --> 01:03:00.880]  when they execute order number 66 that's a revenge of the sith quote execute
[01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:06.000]  order number 66 and believe me that the government admits they have orders like
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:11.000]  order number 66 called the red list but they're not going to get away with the
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:14.960]  red list they could detonate a nuke in chicago and say you know that a guy with
[01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:18.280]  a turban did it or say that i did it and you know they're not going to be able
[01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:22.360]  to to go after everybody because no one believes anything they're saying they've
[01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:26.080]  lost all credibility and that's why they're really we're in a bad position
[01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:29.640]  but so are the controllers because they've they've got control of the
[01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:34.720]  system but now they're uncloak everybody sees them and so they're trying to
[01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:39.920]  accelerate their total takeover and that's only revealing a more and so we're
[01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:43.440]  kind of in a mexican standoff you know a mexican standoff you know that's where
[01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:49.480]  two guys are sitting there pointing guns at each other and i guess there's a more
[01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:52.560]  complex mexican standoff where you got five or six people you know different
[01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:57.480]  groups with guns pointed at everybody and we're we're now reaching that point
[01:03:57.480 --> 01:04:00.440]  that's what happens with world war one world war two world war three coming
[01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:04.560]  whether it's economic or and you could see it all coming together is somebody
[01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:08.200]  just start somebody pulls a trigger a mexican standoff the best example of
[01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:13.480]  mexican standoff will be the good the bad and the ugly with lee van cleef and of
[01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:22.800]  course Clint Eastwood and you know there's three guys at the end the good
[01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:27.040]  the bad and the ugly and they're all at the cemetery where the goals buried and
[01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:29.920]  they've all got guns on each other and they and they don't know who's gonna
[01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:36.040]  draw first and then finally lee van cleef draws and Clint Eastwood's taking
[01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:40.000]  the bullets out of a tuco's gun so he can't do anything but then he notices
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:44.480]  tuco didn't didn't shoot at him he shot at the bad guy so he goes ahead and
[01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:49.080]  gives to go as gold but he doesn't trust to go he ties him up first and says
[01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:53.920]  alright here's your gold he actually puts him in a noose hanging by rope and
[01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:57.840]  then rides off into the distance and shoots the rope as he's standing on top
[01:04:57.840 --> 01:05:02.840]  one of the gravestones this is alex jones with five good reasons you should
[01:05:02.840 --> 01:05:07.280]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:11.280]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:14.720]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:19.240]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:23.800]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:27.840]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:31.600]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:35.240]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:39.560]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup

[01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:41.720]  go ahead and go to Dorothy in Michigan she's not in Kansas anymore Dorothy
[01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:47.480]  welcome hi Alex so good to hear from you or talk to you I've been a listener for
[01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:52.200]  two years now there's so many points I want to get to I know you only have
[01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:56.200]  limited time but the main one is that a few weeks back they're saying about I'm
[01:08:56.200 --> 01:09:02.120]  gonna come out with secrets about aliens or whatever then the UN thing but they've
[01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:07.000]  been doing on a monthly alert system your siren that goes off Saturday at one
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:15.520]  o'clock every afternoon you see you know that that easy do-do-do-do-do-do-do
[01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:19.040]  Dorothy I want to be able to talk to you but your phones really breaking up
[01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:22.800]  but are you talking about alert emergency alert systems that take over the
[01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:28.400]  TVs and radios yes can you hear me better now yes okay because I have I'm
[01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:33.280]  the speaker but yeah that's what they've been doing for the last three weeks I've
[01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:39.640]  been noticing it there last three months yes going back until 1996 when they
[01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:43.360]  really took over the whole telecommunications system completely you
[01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:49.800]  would have a local designated TV and radio stations that would receive the
[01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:54.480]  federal bulletins but under the telecommunications act they had to put
[01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:59.040]  government control boxes in all of the major media institutions that broadcast
[01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:03.320]  or transmit where the government takes over when they want how they want and
[01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:07.320]  they told engineers at the time in the future you're gonna have government
[01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:12.680]  announcements not just you know to test the system but for missing children or
[01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:17.040]  you know things that sounded reasonable the whole amber alert but now it's pay
[01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:22.400]  your carbon taxes today's an ozone action day tattle on your neighbor and
[01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:26.040]  now I see the billboards you know saying report terrorism report suspicious
[01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:30.280]  activity the big electronic billboards that are on the highways that's part of
[01:10:30.280 --> 01:10:36.120]  the system and yeah they're gearing up more and more and training people to
[01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:40.720]  accept government takeover of media and that's what the cyber security act does
[01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:44.880]  is just basically unveils and comes out in the open with the fact that they're
[01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:49.680]  also I need the power to quote shut the web down whenever they want or one
[01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:53.840]  example they gave in the in the legislation was during last year's flu
[01:10:53.840 --> 01:11:00.120]  emergency direct all websites in the United States to the government sites
[01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:05.400]  about the flu so it's just basically they're able to flip a switch and send
[01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:09.320]  the internet to where they want and that's what this whole grid is Dorothy
[01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:15.600]  right and it's been going on you know so the whole city to hear it where it
[01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:22.840]  sounds like the ET you know and the movie where you know that the tone that
[01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:27.640]  they were using when ET the mothership came in do-do-do-do yes I've actually
[01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:31.360]  heard similar yeah now they've put it in all major cities first time I heard
[01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:35.280]  them was about six years ago in Chicago I'm walking around and I hear air raid
[01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:39.800]  sirens being tested and I'm in downtown Chicago and then it's going we are at an
[01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:43.160]  orange alert we're in an orange alert and it was like they turned the whole
[01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:46.240]  city into an airport and like we were walked through the airport you hear we
[01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:49.840]  are now at a yellow alert please watch for suspicious packages and guys and
[01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:53.440]  machine guns are walking by meanwhile their bosses stage the terror attack
[01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:58.360]  very spooky Dorothy shoot some video of it and post it on the web or send it to
[01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:02.080]  us but I have seen mainstream news articles about that intensifying and
[01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:06.760]  they tried this in 89 through the FCC but it didn't go through Congress the
[01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:13.160]  FCC tried to regulate it but Congress said no where all radios all TVs will
[01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:17.200]  have built-in transmitter receivers that you have to pay for and the cost of the
[01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:21.840]  good where the government through broadcast systems takes over and it
[01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:27.720]  literally turns your radio on and makes you you know listen to their emergency
[01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:31.320]  alerts and then they they've made it optional now or you can buy a clock
[01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:35.120]  radio for your house that plugs in the wall it's not hooked to the internet or
[01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:39.720]  anything and it says oh this has emergency weather alerts on it well that
[01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:43.600]  means it's got the chip in it to turn it on on its own just like they want to
[01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:47.720]  control your thermostats just like they you know want cameras and all the cars to
[01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:51.560]  quote watch to see if you look like you're agitated or angry or have a
[01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:55.840]  child's in the car not in a seat belt you know that they're just announcing
[01:12:55.840 --> 01:12:59.440]  this total surveillance grid Dorothy really interesting question so I love
[01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:02.320]  taking calls they take us in different directions let's talk to Paul in
[01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:08.400]  California Paul you're on the air well it's I got two quick suggestions to help
[01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:14.360]  the cars one that you can do and one that the people can do the first one is
[01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:20.240]  how about a deck of cards with all the major alumni players on it that's been
[01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:23.280]  done I mean there's got to be there's got to be more than 10 different companies
[01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:28.080]  that have done that and it is a good idea and the second thing is I found this one
[01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:32.840]  of my mistake I was summoned to do a jury duty and when they got up there to
[01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:38.520]  select the jurors I kind of read them the riot act and it's a pretty good way
[01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:43.440]  to voice your opinion and get it there recorded on some of the bills that go
[01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:49.360]  on in the country so what you say to him Paul well they said this this case
[01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:55.000]  will involve Los Angeles police officers and do you think this will
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:14:00.000]  interfere with your judgment on the case and I said that I kind of snickered
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:04.520]  because they were asking it to a juror a potential juror beside me so I snickered
[01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:08.560]  and the lawyer caught it and he says oh I saw you snicker do you think there'll
[01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:13.240]  be Los Angeles police officers might lie on the stand and I said only if they're
[01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:17.720]  talking and the whole we could hear a pin drop in the whole room you know about
[01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:24.040]  150 people there and then did you see the story yesterday where two cops robbed
[01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:29.640]  an undercover cop to steal his drugs and money I mean it's just you know our
[01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:33.120]  officers wouldn't do that don't listen to Thomas Jefferson when he said don't
[01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:37.440]  trust the government we should give all the power over and give up all our
[01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:42.680]  rights they'll keep us safe yeah yeah exactly so what happened next so what
[01:14:42.680 --> 01:14:47.960]  happened now they basically what happened was you know they asked me a
[01:14:47.960 --> 01:14:53.480]  couple more questions because they were so shocked at what I said and you know I
[01:14:53.480 --> 01:14:58.760]  mean I think I went overboard naturally because I was just caught you know I
[01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:03.080]  just couldn't believe I was saying what I was saying and let me guess you didn't
[01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:10.880]  get the jury you didn't get picked I mean I walked out of there they said they
[01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:14.480]  pretended like all and they went to the next one but then when it came up to my
[01:15:14.480 --> 01:15:19.760]  turn to you know they said okay we can dismiss this potential juror and as I
[01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:26.160]  was leaving the judge said goodbye you know in a very like you know the
[01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:31.140]  sarcastic manner and you know as I walked out of there was almost like one of
[01:15:31.140 --> 01:15:34.440]  those things we had beat up everyone in the bar and you'll walk out and and
[01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:40.040]  everyone just steps aside everyone everyone was just shocked and you know
[01:15:40.040 --> 01:15:43.600]  that you know obviously there were police officers in there and you know I
[01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:47.640]  just didn't care you know well good job Paul good job for getting the word out
[01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:51.480]  it might have been better to actually get on the jury and then give them all
[01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:56.520]  citizen rule books explaining the true role of the jury and by the way every
[01:15:56.520 --> 01:16:01.200]  video and book and t-shirt order at info wars calm gets a free citizen rule
[01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:07.160]  book not the one put out by Dick army that's a neocon book but but one that
[01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:12.000]  truly breaks down the Declaration of Independence Constitution Bell of
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:18.080]  rights founding father quotes jury nullification aka red beckham let's
[01:16:18.080 --> 01:16:22.640]  talk to alex in florida alex you're on the air hey what's happening alex
[01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:26.600]  worldwide broadcasts on your mind not much but I want to give a shout to my
[01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:29.840]  brother michigan dylan real quick I want to say I'm a huge fan of your work
[01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:33.800]  man I want to tell you about what happened to me last month man on the
[01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:37.820]  23rd of September I was like one o'clock in the morning I'm driving to
[01:16:37.820 --> 01:16:43.720]  pick up a pack of cigarettes and I got my 9-11 was an inside job t-shirt on and
[01:16:43.720 --> 01:16:50.160]  I get pulled over and the cop comes up to me you know registration ID and he
[01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:53.120]  asked me to search the car and I was scared go right ahead and on the back
[01:16:53.120 --> 01:16:57.480]  seat I'm in college well let me stop you let me stop you you it's not that you
[01:16:57.480 --> 01:17:01.560]  have something to hide it's that in a police state you can't trust many
[01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:06.240]  officers and I bet you discovered that and you know to do the right thing but
[01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:10.360]  it's your fourth amendment you can't let them set the precedent to search your
[01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:14.880]  car whenever they want you need to tell them no and then they say what do you
[01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:17.480]  have to hide I go what do you have to hide let me search your car you know
[01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:21.280]  come on I mean if you got a radio why are you pulling me over it's the fourth
[01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:24.240]  amendment so he found something he didn't like in the backseat
[01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:29.680]  well yeah I'm doing a college report and I'm doing it on about how 9-11 was an
[01:17:29.680 --> 01:17:33.280]  inside job and it happened to be flipped open to the page about nano
[01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:39.200]  thermite and next he thought you were a terrorist yes sir he's like you know so
[01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:41.920]  what are you playing what are you playing I'm blowing up you know and
[01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:45.200]  he's like looking at my shirt him and his partner flashing lights on my shirt
[01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:48.840]  and he's like so what are you on patriotic or something so they're so
[01:17:48.840 --> 01:17:52.760]  stupid they think that if you believe 9-11's an inside job because the
[01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:56.920]  evidence clearly shows that that then you want to blow something up and that
[01:17:56.920 --> 01:18:00.240]  comes from Glenn Beck he he puts up the talking point that 9-11 true thirds
[01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:06.600]  basically want to blow things up when it's the opposite so I mean if you watch
[01:18:06.600 --> 01:18:10.920]  the film fall the Republic we have the internal police video training where
[01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:15.480]  they say you know basically anybody it could be a terrorist and they put you
[01:18:15.480 --> 01:18:19.400]  in databases so they're turning them into federalized little secret police how
[01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:25.240]  did this end he wound up letting me go with a warning but I mean after 10
[01:18:25.240 --> 01:18:30.600]  minutes or harassing a warning for what I don't know break light being out or
[01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:35.240]  something I forget why the initial reason him pulling me over well I would have
[01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:40.840]  started just saying hey guys search the term building 7 you know research all
[01:18:40.840 --> 01:18:44.360]  the firefighters saying bombs are going off and seeing in saying get back they're
[01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:50.160]  about to blow up 7 you know why don't you guys see because Americans are so
[01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:55.200]  nice and we have a lot of hospitality and we but but a lot of cops take it if

[01:24:11.320 --> 01:24:16.760]  meet are pro-second amendment libertarian minded good people some forces are more
[01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:20.480]  corrupt than others but there's no doubt that the federal government that has
[01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:25.280]  almost completely federalized your local police is run by criminal banks and has
[01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:29.520]  evil intentions for all of us and they're trying to train the police to be
[01:24:29.520 --> 01:24:35.640]  a bunch of bloodthirsty you know death squads against the citizens and you know
[01:24:35.640 --> 01:24:39.800]  training them to be political officers like the commissars in Russia who
[01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:44.200]  persecute people for their political views that is being attempted so make no
[01:24:44.200 --> 01:24:48.480]  mistake police you work for a criminal government an illegitimate shall
[01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:54.040]  chescue type pull pot type system and you need to wake up to that fact let's
[01:24:54.040 --> 01:25:01.320]  talk to Tanya in Vegas you're on the air hey I've been a listener since 2007 I
[01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:06.840]  just had a question and something I noticed like I worked for actually work
[01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:10.640]  at McCarron it's owned by the government out here and we have a lot of people
[01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:15.040]  predominant politicians people traveling all the time and I talked to a guy that I
[01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:18.760]  want to say his name but he works for the pharmaceutical company and I asked him
[01:25:18.760 --> 01:25:23.280]  last year I said what do you think of the H1 in one and he goes oh well you
[01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:29.120]  know it's great you know it really will help you and I'm like okay so he goes
[01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:33.000]  but next year when you get the shot we're just gonna put it in the shot and
[01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:36.560]  that's now been announced and and literally at Walmart they're giving out
[01:25:36.560 --> 01:25:40.800]  free shots they're now giving free passes to topless bars I have that in the
[01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:45.200]  news if you'll go I was talking to some friends that were over this weekend and
[01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:48.720]  they said it was bizarre it was like a horror movie they were in a Walgreens
[01:25:48.720 --> 01:25:52.840]  and it was watching all these little kids getting marched in and you know
[01:25:52.840 --> 01:25:56.240]  everybody getting their shots and when she was at the cash register they were
[01:25:56.240 --> 01:26:00.680]  asking do you want a shot I mean they are really pushing it and you know that
[01:26:00.680 --> 01:26:04.720]  and he thought it was kind of odd when I go but and you think that's okay and he
[01:26:04.720 --> 01:26:08.840]  just like started staring at me like what's wrong with it and I couldn't
[01:26:08.840 --> 01:26:13.080]  figure out why he thought that that was okay well they admit the H1 in one was
[01:26:13.080 --> 01:26:19.360]  an extremely weak flu there's something special in that vaccine and it killed
[01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:23.760]  people in trials in Europe so that's one of these special vaccines they want
[01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:28.480]  to make sure you get I would look out big time and they admit it it I think I
[01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:31.400]  just saw a headline out of Australia Australian government admits it's
[01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:35.800]  increasing seizures in people that take it the British government said the same
[01:26:35.800 --> 01:26:39.520]  thing and that's why you had record low numbers of people taking it last year
[01:26:39.520 --> 01:26:43.400]  and the numbers are already coming in its record lows this year so because
[01:26:43.400 --> 01:26:48.760]  people are wise to them they're trying to triple their propaganda to try to
[01:26:48.760 --> 01:26:54.760]  basically stampede people with a scyop into taking it and also the question I
[01:26:54.760 --> 01:26:58.680]  have is now if they keep printing the dollar and it loses its value do you
[01:26:58.680 --> 01:27:01.760]  think that's when they'll actually start the microchipping because I actually
[01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:06.280]  have my sister in the military and she's been having a dream two nights in a
[01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:11.040]  row that when she's to watch television on the news in her like she said they
[01:27:11.040 --> 01:27:16.320]  were saying report to your nearest microchipping post and she goes what do
[01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:20.320]  you think that means she goes because they said they our dollar is not a value
[01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:24.720]  in her dream and that they can't you know the paper is worthless so they went
[01:27:24.720 --> 01:27:28.440]  to microchipping they set up posts and I go what's just a dream but I don't know
[01:27:28.440 --> 01:27:33.560]  I was thinking you know the more they print it do you do you really you know
[01:27:33.560 --> 01:27:37.000]  do you think they will start implementing the microchip all right let me
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:43.440]  break that down Tanya as we got a break here we know that very chip and the
[01:27:43.440 --> 01:27:49.120]  federal government and IBM have said that by 2020 they want the entire
[01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:55.480]  population to be microchip they already got kids all over the country retina
[01:27:55.480 --> 01:28:00.480]  scanning thumb scanning you name it to be able to get their school lunches it's
[01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:04.920]  going in grocery stores to buy and sell six years ago the Mexican attorney
[01:28:04.920 --> 01:28:08.800]  general made his employees take microchips it's come out they've been
[01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:12.760]  testing the chip on some of the troops but it's classified and so we know that's
[01:28:12.760 --> 01:28:16.800]  their intention but I think her pathetic dream you know I mean maybe a
[01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:27.840]  pathetic or prophetic but the issue here is we know that the Federal Reserve has
[01:28:27.840 --> 01:28:36.200]  now become the second biggest owner of treasuries but China's number one it was
[01:28:36.200 --> 01:28:40.480]  Europe number two and then Japan number three now the Federal Reserve will put
[01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:43.800]  that back on screen from zero hedge and they've got the official government
[01:28:43.800 --> 01:28:49.960]  numbers there it's official the Fed is now the second largest holder of US
[01:28:49.960 --> 01:28:54.560]  Treasury bonds so when they talk about the printing presses being turned up on
[01:28:54.560 --> 01:29:00.520]  high they're not physically printing a bunch of money for you which is still
[01:29:00.520 --> 01:29:04.000]  back as it devalues the currency down the road they're creating tens of
[01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:08.880]  trillions for the central banks to buy up whatever they want namely US
[01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:13.800]  treasuries and then they get paid interest on that so the Federal Reserve
[01:29:13.800 --> 01:29:18.920]  that's private uses our tax money to then buy treasuries so they control the
[01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:23.640]  entire spectrum and people talk about how we're dependent on China because
[01:29:23.640 --> 01:29:27.560]  they're the biggest owner of our debt the Federal Reserve the private banking
[01:29:27.560 --> 01:29:32.600]  cartel is now the second biggest owner and they're above Congress they can do
[01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:36.480]  whatever they want and it's all fraudulent so that's a very very important
[01:29:36.480 --> 01:29:41.200]  point we're gonna cover later with Judge Andrew Napolitano here on the
[01:29:41.200 --> 01:29:45.520]  broadcast today got some key announcements coming up on the other side a

[01:32:04.440 --> 01:32:08.280]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your
[01:32:08.280 --> 01:32:12.280]  electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much
[01:32:12.280 --> 01:32:16.360]  power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[01:32:16.360 --> 01:32:20.720]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[01:32:20.720 --> 01:32:24.640]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[01:32:24.640 --> 01:32:29.360]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[01:32:29.360 --> 01:32:33.480]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[01:32:33.480 --> 01:32:37.480]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[01:32:37.480 --> 01:32:41.280]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I

[01:33:01.400 --> 01:33:14.800]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order it's Alex Jones on
[01:33:14.800 --> 01:33:20.600]  the GCN radio network okay I've got to get to a bunch of news now but we will
[01:33:20.600 --> 01:33:25.880]  get to Roxanne, Nick, Dan, Paul and others that are holding but time
[01:33:25.880 --> 01:33:35.000]  certainly flies and we are now only about what three and four we're only
[01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:43.680]  about you know seven eight days away from the 24-hour plus marathon broadcast
[01:33:43.680 --> 01:33:49.800]  I'm gonna be doing on the 24th next Thursday seven and a half eight days
[01:33:49.800 --> 01:33:55.400]  away I'm gonna go live at 11 a.m. in the morning on Thursday and I'm gonna
[01:33:55.400 --> 01:34:03.480]  broadcast straight through until noon the next day I'll do the first hour of
[01:34:03.480 --> 01:34:07.360]  the Friday show live and then Paul Joseph Watson's gonna be sitting in via
[01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:14.280]  video Skype from the United Kingdom so that is coming up and I just wanted to
[01:34:14.280 --> 01:34:18.880]  tell you that I have shot it's got to be more than 50 video interviews the last
[01:34:18.880 --> 01:34:25.040]  two years flying all over the country for my eugenics film and it's coming out
[01:34:25.040 --> 01:34:32.600]  next year but this can't wait we're gonna air never before seen powerful video
[01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:39.280]  interviews during that 24-hour period our 25-hour period we're going to air at
[01:34:39.280 --> 01:34:46.000]  least eight of these with people like Alan Watt Lord Christopher Monkton Dr.
[01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:53.680]  Paul Craig Roberts Dr. Sherry Tin Penny the list just goes on and on with who
[01:34:53.680 --> 01:34:56.840]  we're gonna have on the show we're gonna have live interviews with Max Kaiser
[01:34:56.840 --> 01:35:03.360]  we're gonna have live interviews with Gerald Solente we're gonna have live
[01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:09.000]  interview with David Ike I mean literally it's gonna be a jam-packed 24 or
[01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:15.240]  25-hour transmission starting the 24th when the show kicks off at 11 a.m.
[01:35:15.240 --> 01:35:20.760]  Central running right through to the next Friday show live and we're working
[01:35:20.760 --> 01:35:27.040]  on this with our servers trying to make prison planet TV free for that day
[01:35:27.040 --> 01:35:31.920]  where we can have a video box you know where people can watch what everybody
[01:35:31.920 --> 01:35:36.040]  who's a prison planet TV member gets to see during that 25-hour period the
[01:35:36.040 --> 01:35:41.640]  problem is we're looking at bandwidth not the paying for it but if it really
[01:35:41.640 --> 01:35:48.480]  takes off and you get you know 30 40 50,000 people watching the video streams
[01:35:48.480 --> 01:35:52.680]  so it we're trying to work on how do we with CDNs it gets all the technical
[01:35:52.680 --> 01:35:57.720]  things limit the amount that can watch it but I mean it may not be a problem
[01:35:57.720 --> 01:36:00.720]  they just be 10,000 people that are watching the video stream not just
[01:36:00.720 --> 01:36:04.040]  listening to the internet streams we have hundreds of thousands a day that
[01:36:04.040 --> 01:36:07.800]  tune in just the free internet streams at info wars.com but we're gonna try
[01:36:07.800 --> 01:36:11.960]  that as well because we're gonna be obviously transmitting at prison planet
[01:36:11.960 --> 01:36:16.280]  TV but for radio listeners you'll be able to hear the interviews with Paul
[01:36:16.280 --> 01:36:22.920]  Craig Roberts, Alan Watt, Jeffrey Smith,
[01:36:23.800 --> 01:36:32.360]  Catherine Austin Fitz, Dr. Childress, Tim Penny, and so many others Gerald
[01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:37.240]  Salente but but also Salente, Tarpley, we're not just airing never-before-seen
[01:36:37.240 --> 01:36:41.480]  video interviews with them we're going to be having them on the show live as
[01:36:41.480 --> 01:36:45.560]  well and taking your phone calls 25 hour well if you count Watson it's gonna
[01:36:45.560 --> 01:36:53.960]  be 26 27 27 hour marathon transmission and obviously when we air 30 minute
[01:36:53.960 --> 01:36:57.720]  hour-long interviews I'll give myself a chance to you know go sit on the couch
[01:36:57.720 --> 01:37:03.880]  or whatever try to take a cat nap but I could do I could probably do 25 hours
[01:37:03.880 --> 01:37:08.720]  without you taking a call I'm I could talk forever there's so much news and so
[01:37:08.720 --> 01:37:13.200]  much information but that's the money bomb day and we've raised about 46,000
[01:37:13.200 --> 01:37:17.800]  dollars I'd like to raise a hundred thousand just before the money bomb so
[01:37:17.800 --> 01:37:20.720]  I'm confident that we can raise the additional 400,000 that sounds like a
[01:37:20.720 --> 01:37:25.760]  lot it cost around 200,000 dollars a month just to run this operation with
[01:37:25.760 --> 01:37:33.520]  the 20 employees and contractors the bandwidth the offices the computers the
[01:37:33.520 --> 01:37:38.560]  info the flying around doing the interviews just everything we do with
[01:37:38.560 --> 01:37:43.960]  the books the films the material and we're trying to expand I mean I after
[01:37:43.960 --> 01:37:49.200]  the studio is completely done you've seen the interview the tour of the shell
[01:37:49.200 --> 01:37:53.360]  of the building it was a warehouse now it's a fully you know completed office
[01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:58.000]  except for the equipment and the furniture and the personnel and anybody
[01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:03.440]  who's running operation we we are three four people at modest pay and with the
[01:38:03.440 --> 01:38:07.320]  rent next year and the equipment and everything and the bandwidth and the
[01:38:07.320 --> 01:38:10.680]  things associated with it and the consultants to come in and help us you
[01:38:10.680 --> 01:38:16.720]  know finish out the studio conservatively 400,000 what we need 500,000 we could do
[01:38:16.720 --> 01:38:22.280]  it confidently and go should we buy this new video switcher that's 20,000 and is
[01:38:22.280 --> 01:38:27.040]  not that good or 50,000 and buy something awesome you know should we go
[01:38:27.040 --> 01:38:32.920]  with prosumer $3,000 cameras in here or should we go to the next level and have
[01:38:32.920 --> 01:38:37.880]  it be a lot higher quality and spend 6,000 per camera I mean it's all really
[01:38:37.880 --> 01:38:41.080]  up to you and we've got a special account that all the donations are going
[01:38:41.080 --> 01:38:45.560]  into that way a hundred percent of it will be spent on the operation and what
[01:38:45.560 --> 01:38:48.600]  we're doing here it was obviously with videos and book sales and everything we
[01:38:48.600 --> 01:38:52.160]  do I take part of that you know to run my own life and operation and put money
[01:38:52.160 --> 01:38:54.720]  back to be able to you know keep this place in place if there's a total
[01:38:54.720 --> 01:38:59.520]  complete meltdown of society and that's the big issue we've got limited back-up
[01:38:59.520 --> 01:39:03.480]  funds and it's really a risk for us to finish the studio and launch these new
[01:39:03.480 --> 01:39:07.440]  operations because it will destroy our backup and you know we need that
[01:39:07.440 --> 01:39:12.000]  backup so if you want to start donating an info wars money bomb calm I want to
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.960]  thank those that have donated if you don't have money in the spat economy
[01:39:14.960 --> 01:39:18.240]  people who are not in good shape I don't want a red cent you can spread the
[01:39:18.240 --> 01:39:22.720]  word about the show the free podcast the free iphone app at info wars.com the
[01:39:22.720 --> 01:39:24.840]  local AM and FM stations you're listening to you can spread the word
[01:39:24.840 --> 01:39:29.480]  about those if you're not doing well financially I know most people aren't
[01:39:29.480 --> 01:39:32.680]  doing well don't don't give we're not like one of those preachers telling old
[01:39:32.680 --> 01:39:36.280]  ladies you're out of money but give us money and the God will bless you and
[01:39:36.280 --> 01:39:39.040]  you'll you know everything will be okay no everything probably won't be all
[01:39:39.040 --> 01:39:42.960]  right but I mean certainly God does help people sometimes that give that don't
[01:39:42.960 --> 01:39:48.520]  have it but I don't want that okay I know that we have listeners who are worth
[01:39:48.520 --> 01:39:53.920]  hundreds of millions of dollars and a lot of folks have pointed out I should go
[01:39:53.920 --> 01:39:58.440]  to some of the people I know and try to get them to donate but I just I don't
[01:39:58.440 --> 01:40:03.120]  know the point is is that okay step up donate I mean maybe a million will come
[01:40:03.120 --> 01:40:06.680]  in maybe four million like Ron Paul did can you imagine what we do with that can
[01:40:06.680 --> 01:40:11.040]  you imagine maybe I should just do a speaking tour like Glenn Beck does in
[01:40:11.040 --> 01:40:13.640]  charge a hundred dollars and pack stadiums of you know with three four
[01:40:13.640 --> 01:40:17.000]  thousand people we could do it and then I would raise millions and I could do it
[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:23.720]  that way I'm really starting to think about maybe doing that but it's my
[01:40:23.720 --> 01:40:27.000]  instinct to give things away for free I mean remember when you donate remember
[01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:30.680]  when you support us remember when you buy the books and videos I pioneered
[01:40:30.680 --> 01:40:33.120]  make copies good about everybody you know because I want to get the word out
[01:40:33.120 --> 01:40:36.400]  you know I've pioneered having all these other activists and people on to
[01:40:36.400 --> 01:40:41.240]  support their operations and what they're doing we pioneered you know trying to do
[01:40:41.240 --> 01:40:47.640]  it at cost I mean it's like I was talking to the radio stations out in you
[01:40:47.640 --> 01:40:50.880]  know just south of San Francisco and Santa Cruz that carry the show they're
[01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:53.960]  like well what do you think we should charge they said what we need to pay you
[01:40:53.960 --> 01:40:58.480]  to come out here and I said well pay me nothing you know get my plane ticket and
[01:40:58.480 --> 01:41:04.480]  my hotel but I want to charge something that's cost and they said how about ten
[01:41:04.480 --> 01:41:10.520]  dollars and eighty cents and it sold out so I I have kind of weird ways of doing
[01:41:10.520 --> 01:41:13.680]  things and it was listeners that started the money bomb three years ago and I
[01:41:13.680 --> 01:41:15.880]  kind of ignored it people like why aren't you covering I go well I don't
[01:41:15.880 --> 01:41:21.800]  really like asking for donations but the government takes my tax money your tax
[01:41:21.800 --> 01:41:24.840]  money our tax money same thing in Europe and gives it not just a government
[01:41:24.840 --> 01:41:29.600]  broadcasting like PBS or public radio they give it in product placement
[01:41:29.600 --> 01:41:34.040]  propaganda placement behavior placement as they call it by the billions every
[01:41:34.040 --> 01:41:39.920]  month to media so they're already taking your money and financing Fox News ABC
[01:41:39.920 --> 01:41:45.000]  News NBC CBS I told you this years ago the CIA's and all those networks and it
[01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:48.800]  was in mainstream news this week that army army psychological warfare because
[01:41:48.800 --> 01:41:52.320]  it came out they were in CBS and people said oh well they're just there being
[01:41:52.320 --> 01:41:56.280]  trained no it's the other way around and I remember seeing articles 12 years ago
[01:41:56.280 --> 01:42:04.160]  about CBS broadcast center it actually prepares the news for NBC ABC and one
[01:42:04.160 --> 01:42:07.960]  other network I mean it's really just one group folks and one plays the part of
[01:42:07.960 --> 01:42:11.720]  liberal one of the conservative one kind of middle of the road and then they give
[01:42:11.720 --> 01:42:16.240]  the the illusion of choice so we need to go to the next level I mean I could just
[01:42:16.240 --> 01:42:20.000]  sit here on my laurels keep doing the show making films doing all of this but
[01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:23.200]  we need to not make two films here we need to make four or five a year we need
[01:42:23.200 --> 01:42:28.000]  to have the TV show every day and then one special show a week we need to up
[01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:32.280]  everything we're doing because I've reached 200 plus million people just on
[01:42:32.280 --> 01:42:36.120]  YouTube and Google in the last two or three years alone just on those platforms
[01:42:36.120 --> 01:42:40.120]  hundreds and hundreds of millions I've reached hundreds of millions in radio and
[01:42:40.120 --> 01:42:44.640]  TV interviews I've reached tens of millions on my radio show it's ridiculous
[01:42:44.640 --> 01:42:50.600]  how effective we are okay and the system knows that and so we are supported by
[01:42:50.600 --> 01:42:54.840]  sponsors and by you the listeners and so if you want to go ahead and start I
[01:42:54.840 --> 01:42:57.080]  want to thank those that have donated you want to start donating because I want

[01:43:48.040 --> 01:43:54.600]  are promoting this themselves I really do appreciate that because we want this
[01:43:54.600 --> 01:43:59.400]  to be the biggest success ever so we can up our game and gear up against the
[01:43:59.400 --> 01:44:08.240]  globalist okay before I get into the attacks on the first amendment and then
[01:44:08.240 --> 01:44:15.600]  your phone calls and some economic news you remember a month ago nightline
[01:44:15.600 --> 01:44:20.200]  attacked us and they started the piece by saying does he really believe what he's
[01:44:20.200 --> 01:44:24.000]  saying and plying I don't you know it doesn't matter if I believe or not of
[01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.840]  course I believe it I know it I don't believe it I know it I have all the
[01:44:26.840 --> 01:44:31.080]  proof and I show it to you I show you what every quote every statement every
[01:44:31.080 --> 01:44:36.880]  article every factoid every number where it came from and then they go on to say
[01:44:36.880 --> 01:44:41.920]  if a nut was on the street saying they're poisoning the water you know
[01:44:41.920 --> 01:44:45.840]  basically run away from them but if you got a radio show you get a million
[01:44:45.840 --> 01:44:49.920]  listeners and ABC went out and did their own research and found that I have about
[01:44:49.920 --> 01:44:52.960]  a million listeners a day I guess they went to the same places the same
[01:44:52.960 --> 01:44:56.600]  aggregate systems we do to know that it's more like two to three million but
[01:44:56.600 --> 01:45:00.120]  point is it's a million that listen to the show while it's live and one way or
[01:45:00.120 --> 01:45:02.960]  another and about another million and a half that listen to it the next day or
[01:45:02.960 --> 01:45:08.920]  so on rebroadcast shortwave satellite internet streams podcast things like
[01:45:08.920 --> 01:45:16.800]  that but two and a half mill or so it varies but then Glenn Beck comes out and
[01:45:16.800 --> 01:45:20.320]  says the Fabian socialists wanted to put things in the water to sterilize you so
[01:45:20.320 --> 01:45:23.440]  I've been asking Beck to do that because the quotes are there it's public and
[01:45:23.440 --> 01:45:29.320]  literally the Bertrand Shaw quotes that we played three or four years ago last
[01:45:29.320 --> 01:45:33.480]  year this year the very video clips we play here he now played them last night
[01:45:33.480 --> 01:45:37.160]  now again I don't trust him but I got to say that's moving in the right
[01:45:37.160 --> 01:45:41.120]  direction okay that's moving in the right direction I mean just last week I
[01:45:41.120 --> 01:45:44.680]  put out two videos specifically challenging him to talk about
[01:45:44.680 --> 01:45:48.520]  sterilants in the water and I played the clip of where he said I drink a bucket of
[01:45:48.520 --> 01:45:52.600]  fluoride I like fluoride the water well Beck what do you think the sterilin is
[01:45:52.600 --> 01:45:56.640]  it's sodium fluoride I mean Beck your your people are watching right now you
[01:45:56.640 --> 01:46:02.000]  may even be watching right now we know that just search sodium fluoride
[01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:07.320]  infertility studies sodium fluoride cancer studies sodium fluoride reduced
[01:46:07.320 --> 01:46:14.880]  IQ studies these are mainline medical journals governments governments so
[01:46:14.880 --> 01:46:17.920]  people say why do you talk about Beck so much because they literally are
[01:46:17.920 --> 01:46:21.400]  programming off the show I could see their show and know they're doing it but I
[01:46:21.400 --> 01:46:27.680]  have it from inside so please please Beck you know a year ago you said you
[01:46:27.680 --> 01:46:30.480]  drink buckets of fluoride it was about a year ago now you're going the right
[01:46:30.480 --> 01:46:35.280]  direction but if you're wondering what Bertrand Russell and others in the UN
[01:46:35.280 --> 01:46:40.640]  called for it was fluoride because it's massively reduces fertility okay so you
[01:46:40.640 --> 01:46:45.200]  you've got their documents read a little bit further down when you're quoting
[01:46:45.200 --> 01:46:51.840]  Shaw and and Russell and others and then go further don't just read stuff from
[01:46:51.840 --> 01:46:59.840]  30 40 50 60 70 80 years ago or video clips Beck go all the way read the
[01:46:59.840 --> 01:47:03.920]  current stuff in the news today where these monsters are promoting it okay
[01:47:03.920 --> 01:47:07.120]  don't just tell us about dead monsters tell us about the real ones that are
[01:47:07.120 --> 01:47:11.320]  alive today stalking the countryside but but first here is part of the
[01:47:11.320 --> 01:47:16.720]  nightline piece where a month ago it's kooky on nightline and a month later
[01:47:16.720 --> 01:47:21.280]  Glenn Beck is now covering it this is very positive and so I'm talking right
[01:47:21.280 --> 01:47:25.120]  to Beck telling him go to the next level I'm holding his hand here it is Beck you
[01:47:25.120 --> 01:47:29.160]  obviously already know all this stuff go all the way now I have seen now Foxing
[01:47:29.160 --> 01:47:33.120]  they're talking about firing him that was in the New York Times maybe he's hit
[01:47:33.120 --> 01:47:37.640]  maybe he is getting good or something I don't know I mean if they fire him like
[01:47:37.640 --> 01:47:42.480]  they did Lou Dobbs maybe he is I mean I don't know the point is we're watching
[01:47:42.480 --> 01:47:51.200]  and we're fair we're open-minded here's that nightline clip if you're to stand
[01:47:51.200 --> 01:47:54.480]  on a street corner hollering that the government is poisoning our water
[01:47:54.480 --> 01:47:58.640]  supply you'd probably get a little more than I rolls and head shakes but do the
[01:47:58.640 --> 01:48:02.640]  same thing in a radio booth you might just get a million listeners a day such
[01:48:02.640 --> 01:48:07.000]  as the case for Alex Jones a man who trades in such sinister conspiracy
[01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:10.920]  theories you have to wonder if he really believes half of what he says Dan
[01:48:10.920 --> 01:48:16.360]  Harris went to Texas to find out are you for Hitler against Hitler whatever
[01:48:16.360 --> 01:48:20.720]  they say it's the opposite they never I tell the truth all right they they took
[01:48:20.720 --> 01:48:24.480]  a clip are you for Hitler against him and cut it into something I was saying
[01:48:24.480 --> 01:48:30.880]  20 minutes later that's why I almost don't do media interviews because I got
[01:48:30.880 --> 01:48:35.880]  interviewed by some people that seem nice about population reduction and now
[01:48:35.880 --> 01:48:39.960]  I learned it's coming out in a film that part of the film is Muslims did 9-11
[01:48:39.960 --> 01:48:44.520]  I mean I just can't control what media does but then do you just turn them down
[01:48:44.520 --> 01:48:48.800]  and cowardly not do it that sounds like I'm saying is Hitler good or bad when I
[01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:55.200]  was saying Hitler is either good or bad you can't have it both ways like our
[01:48:55.200 --> 01:48:58.680]  government's either good or bad no it's clearly bad but they took that out of
[01:48:58.680 --> 01:49:03.800]  context but side issue let's go to this first clip where he's talking about
[01:49:03.800 --> 01:49:09.280]  Fabian Socialist here's Glenn Beck a month and a half later talking about
[01:49:09.280 --> 01:49:15.240]  poisoning the water here it is here's what everybody adores from Shaw this
[01:49:15.240 --> 01:49:44.240]  what just put in there and say sir or madam now we'll be kind enough to justify your existence if you're not pulling your weight in the social group if you're not producing as much as you consume then clearly we cannot use the big organization of our society for the purpose of keeping you alive
[01:49:44.240 --> 01:50:11.240]  that's really bad audio with the video that we've been airing for at least four years but they have the quotes up there and he also wrote this in books Mr. Shaw but that's the death panels that's what Bill Gates said a month ago he said if we don't give grandma care we can hire 10 teachers without money they once they get you collectivize they play you off against each other oh you gave money to the Democrats you get to keep your GM car dealership you're a Republican you don't
[01:50:11.240 --> 01:50:30.240]  oh we're gonna use bailout money to ship GM overseas it allows them to organize the economy and control the resources and then get us fighting with each other over it but then bet comes back and we'll play it after the break and basically tells the truth about these people but they're not
[01:50:30.240 --> 01:50:45.240]  they're not progressives that's just some modern term they're eugenicists they are they want to collectivize you to domesticate you so they control you so they can kill you and that's what Shaw said he said poison the water supply
[01:50:45.240 --> 01:51:00.240]  well that's what they're doing you know this guy said this in the 30s and 40s and praise Mussolini and Hitler as a liberal well they're doing it now do you understand they run our planet we'll be right back
[01:51:00.240 --> 01:51:18.240]  hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen again

[01:54:01.240 --> 01:54:23.240]  see this is the inverse of what libertarians or constitutionalists say they say don't have a bunch of welfare or have it be private and that will encourage people to be rugged individuals but the socialist engineers the eugenicist they set up the health departments over 100 years ago in England in the U.S. to exterminate people
[01:54:23.240 --> 01:54:40.240]  this is social Malthusian social Darwinism and so they collectivize things make it to where you can't take care of yourself and then say we're going to kill you if you don't produce for us and if you don't justify yourself for the state
[01:54:40.240 --> 01:54:56.240]  that was basically the video clip quote but it was bad audio because it was shot in the 30s of George Shaw George Bernard Shaw but let me read you the quote you must all know half a dozen people at least who are of no use in this world
[01:54:56.240 --> 01:55:11.240]  of course the state will decide who are more trouble than they are worth you know like grandma Bill Gates so get rid of her the case for killing granny cover a newsweek just put them there and say madam now you will be kind enough to justify your existence because I'm God
[01:55:11.240 --> 01:55:28.240]  he didn't say that part just put them there and say sir or madam now you will be kind enough to justify your existence if you can't justify your existence if you're not pulling your weight in the social boat if you're not producing as much as you consume or perhaps a little more than clearly
[01:55:28.240 --> 01:55:38.240]  we cannot use the organizations of society for the purpose of keeping you alive because your life does not benefit us and it can't be a very much used to yourself
[01:55:38.240 --> 01:55:55.240]  if we don't give grandma end of life treatment we can hire 10 teachers that's exactly what Bill Gates is saying his dad formerly on the board of Planned Parenthood he is a eugenicist but they say oh Bill Gates is helping people let's finish up with this clip of Beck
[01:55:55.240 --> 01:56:11.240]  it's not useful to you or to the society the man was a monster Shaw was a famous playwright but he was also a strong believer in eugenics who dreamt up the gas chambers the death chambers
[01:56:11.240 --> 01:56:25.240]  okay who did I mean look you've got to praise what Beck just did and it went on for an hour okay now who dreamt up staging terror the eugenicist Hitler you won't talk about that though Beck let's see you do that
[01:56:25.240 --> 01:56:33.240]  let's see you do that let's see you get those firefighters on the hundreds of them that saw the bombs going off play the CNN clip they're saying get back we're going to blow up seven
[01:56:33.240 --> 01:56:46.240]  no you just rather say we're violent 9-11 truthers and should be arrested that's why I don't trust you but you're going in the right direction now here's this next clip about the Fabian socialist wanting to sterilize you through the water
[01:56:46.240 --> 01:56:50.240]  it just went on and on here it is
[01:56:50.240 --> 01:57:06.240]  it's a cold calculation based on the greater good for society it's called look it up please don't take any of this myself look it up Zeke Emanuel White House it's called the complete lives system
[01:57:06.240 --> 01:57:20.240]  it's how George Bernard Shaw can propose lethal chambers it's how this woman can advocate smothering children with pillows it's how environmentalists can justify executing skeptics
[01:57:20.240 --> 01:57:42.240]  it's how Obama's science czar John Holdren who believed in the wildly discredited idea of the population explosion can propose putting sterilants in drinking water and forced sterilizations and a planetary regime i.e. global government to monitor global population size
[01:57:42.240 --> 01:58:00.240]  it's for the greater good unbelievable unbelievable unbelievable i don't know how he's got a contract there and they don't want to pay out his three million a year just for TV but he told the New York Times you know that he's in rough waters with Ailes and i
[01:58:00.240 --> 01:58:16.240]  i understand why because uh... Rupert Murdoch funds all this and goes to Davos and promotes eugenics garbage on fox entertainment television and movies and admit that that's their goal so so beck i mean you literally are in the devil's workshop
[01:58:16.240 --> 01:58:23.240]  you're telling us about some of the devil's little demons but how about you tell us about one of the top fallen angels you know they're serving Lucifer
[01:58:23.240 --> 01:58:31.240]  why don't you tell us about your boss who looks like the emperor from star wars and why don't you tell us about him
[01:58:31.240 --> 01:58:35.240]  still i have to give him credit where credit is due this is groundbreaking
[01:58:35.240 --> 01:58:43.240]  okay so all i can do is give credit to that it's the truth

[02:00:25.240 --> 02:00:31.240]  we're back live if you just joined us if your station just tuned in to us
[02:00:31.240 --> 02:00:38.240]  i just covered incredible incredible clips by glen back he's not just talking about people 60 years ago now
[02:00:38.240 --> 02:00:42.240]  he's talking about the white house science are wanting to put sterilants in the water
[02:00:42.240 --> 02:00:46.240]  to sterilize you as part of a world government and how this entire group
[02:00:46.240 --> 02:00:52.240]  wants to do this and kill people in gas chambers those gas chamber ideas actually came
[02:00:52.240 --> 02:01:02.240]  from the eugenesis people like mr. shaw birch and russell the liberals and people can argue
[02:01:02.240 --> 02:01:06.240]  all day about you know what hitler was exactly doing or how he killed people but i've got
[02:01:06.240 --> 02:01:10.240]  the books written by shaw we've got them back during our library we've shot video of it put it
[02:01:10.240 --> 02:01:16.240]  in films years ago showed it to you on tv they talked about gas chambers for some of you out there
[02:01:16.240 --> 02:01:21.240]  that deny hitler had gas chambers so he certainly killed a bunch of people and these people were
[02:01:21.240 --> 02:01:29.240]  proposing gas chambers and poisoning the water and we know that they are doing it now to everybody
[02:01:29.240 --> 02:01:35.240]  with soft slow kills there can be no doubt i mean i already know it from inside sources but
[02:01:35.240 --> 02:01:41.240]  no doubt glenbeck they are watching everything we do it's amazing and so i have to really
[02:01:41.240 --> 02:01:46.240]  up up what i'm doing in my research to realize that a lot of what i cover now ends up on
[02:01:46.240 --> 02:01:52.240]  fox television and on glenbeck's radio show so i'm actually happy that some good is being
[02:01:52.240 --> 02:01:57.240]  done through him but i'm i'm done ranting about that we're going into the economy and the
[02:01:57.240 --> 02:02:00.240]  attack on the first amendment judge andrew napolitano coming on who i know is a great
[02:02:00.240 --> 02:02:05.240]  very very exciting to have him coming on but let's talk to rocks and in texas rocks and you're
[02:02:05.240 --> 02:02:10.240]  on the air hello good afternoon and thank you for all that you do and i'm going to give you
[02:02:10.240 --> 02:02:16.240]  a hundred dollars to your site or your cameras or whatever you want thank you ma'am i don't

[02:02:20.240 --> 02:02:25.240]  much i don't want you to donate we've got plenty of people out there you know that spend
[02:02:25.240 --> 02:02:30.240]  thousands of dollars a week on fine wine who are supposed patriots they can give to the
[02:02:30.240 --> 02:02:36.240]  money bomb but sorry go ahead and i'm not sure i've been researching the bloodlines
[02:02:36.240 --> 02:02:42.240]  of our president and thirty three of the forty two are all traced back to charlamagne now
[02:02:42.240 --> 02:02:48.240]  nineteen also are related to king edward of a third of it i've seen that at ancestry dot
[02:02:48.240 --> 02:02:55.240]  com and uh... almost all presidents are related and you had in two thousand four carry and
[02:02:55.240 --> 02:03:01.240]  bush who were cousins on every side you know fifth cousins twelfth cuz i mean just every
[02:03:01.240 --> 02:03:05.240]  it's like i've got a french bulldog it's related to every other french bulldog in the world
[02:03:05.240 --> 02:03:11.240]  it's a breed of dog carry and bush same fraternity same secret society cousins on every
[02:03:11.240 --> 02:03:18.240]  side every relation and then they did breakdowns of their wives uh... being uh... related
[02:03:18.240 --> 02:03:24.240]  i mean it is a breed of globalist go ahead well also the same thing obama and uh...

[02:03:30.240 --> 02:03:34.240]  all related i'm sorry go ahead it's frightening but um... my other point i'm a little stuffed
[02:03:34.240 --> 02:03:39.240]  up at the other night i live in houston and as you know our summers are very hot here
[02:03:39.240 --> 02:03:46.240]  and we get these new breed of mosquitoes they're very tiny and they bite and it's a whole
[02:03:46.240 --> 02:03:51.240]  new mosquito i've never seen in the last couple years and i get well like bigger than two quarters
[02:03:51.240 --> 02:03:56.240]  it's huge and then the other night they came spraying they don't spray on mosquitoes around
[02:03:56.240 --> 02:04:01.240]  they spray so then we can get sick so we can go get the flu shot i went running in the house
[02:04:01.240 --> 02:04:05.240]  cuz i didn't know the truck was coming cuz it never comes when you need them but anyway
[02:04:05.240 --> 02:04:10.240]  all part of that master plan is to spray him down get him in to get the flu shot let's
[02:04:10.240 --> 02:04:15.240]  get him you know that it just it never ends no i mean everybody i know across the country

[02:08:15.240 --> 02:08:21.240]  into the economy in about five minutes and i told you the start of the broadcast that
[02:08:21.240 --> 02:08:27.240]  our top story the most important thing we're facing is in closing arguments yesterday the
[02:08:27.240 --> 02:08:34.240]  majority of supreme court justices made statements that they are going to restrict free speech
[02:08:34.240 --> 02:08:41.240]  for the first time in united states history they are going to restrict protest they are
[02:08:41.240 --> 02:08:48.240]  going to restrict any speech that is seen as hurtful or that anyone is offended by now
[02:08:48.240 --> 02:08:53.240]  the same thing is happening in england they've just passed the law i covered that last week
[02:08:53.240 --> 02:08:57.240]  where if someone is offended by what you say even if it isn't about them you can be sued
[02:08:57.240 --> 02:09:02.240]  and they say you're liable this is how they're going to shut down free speech well this is
[02:09:02.240 --> 02:09:12.240]  one slice of it and i am shaken i am shaken by the information that i just read during
[02:09:12.240 --> 02:09:16.240]  the break paul watson i was calling him during the break about another issue and he said
[02:09:16.240 --> 02:09:21.240]  why aren't you covering my story and i said well i hadn't seen it in the last hour and
[02:09:21.240 --> 02:09:26.240]  when i read it i had seen previous statements out of cast sunstein the u n the secret copyright
[02:09:26.240 --> 02:09:32.240]  treaty that's now public the announcements by internet to this private government slash
[02:09:32.240 --> 02:09:39.240]  consortium private corporate government consortium that they are going to make you get licensed
[02:09:39.240 --> 02:09:45.240]  with an internet id to get on the web if they claim you do anything wrong no judge no jerry
[02:09:45.240 --> 02:09:50.240]  the corporations will shut you down this is corporate global governance just like private
[02:09:50.240 --> 02:09:56.240]  corporate security guards were snatching and grabbing citizens in england pittsburgh us
[02:09:56.240 --> 02:10:02.240]  and toronto canada the g20 it's they said it's a continuity of agenda this is so huge
[02:10:02.240 --> 02:10:07.240]  i mean i'm almost shaking over this they're really doing this and they launched the last
[02:10:07.240 --> 02:10:11.240]  worm last week and then announced that they want to take over the web to keep you safe
[02:10:11.240 --> 02:10:18.240]  from it when they admittedly launched it there is a cocktail of attacks kind of like a tinker
[02:10:18.240 --> 02:10:24.240]  toy set or legos where the pieces together you can't tell what they are when it goes together
[02:10:24.240 --> 02:10:28.240]  you see it and they admit that that's what they're doing now now hold on to yourselves
[02:10:28.240 --> 02:10:36.240]  here hold on to your hat first amendment ruling destined to kill internet free speech because
[02:10:36.240 --> 02:10:42.240]  the the justices went on to say this will shut down saying mean things on the web about
[02:10:42.240 --> 02:10:48.240]  government individuals you name it you will you know this will open the door for federal
[02:10:48.240 --> 02:10:52.240]  law state laws they couldn't pass cyberbullying act where it said if you hurt someone's feelings
[02:10:52.240 --> 02:10:58.240]  you get hardcore hate crime jail time they couldn't get that through so they're legislating
[02:10:58.240 --> 02:11:04.240]  from the bench exactly what happened in the soviet union in nazi germany you know sometimes
[02:11:04.240 --> 02:11:08.240]  hitler couldn't even get the right stag when he first got into office to do things so he
[02:11:08.240 --> 02:11:13.240]  just have the courts do it or he just have private security thugs come beat you up same
[02:11:13.240 --> 02:11:17.240]  thing we've been through this before so here's curtain emos article first amendment ruling
[02:11:17.240 --> 02:11:22.240]  destined to kill internet free speech and it quotes the la times and quotes the supreme
[02:11:22.240 --> 02:11:27.240]  court justices in the case of these people going to funerals and screaming you know your
[02:11:27.240 --> 02:11:32.240]  son deserve to die god loves that they're dead dragging the american flag behind them it looks
[02:11:32.240 --> 02:11:37.240]  like it's staged to me i mean i've seen the people on tv it looks cartoonish and i and
[02:11:37.240 --> 02:11:42.240]  now you can really see that they take something distasteful that most people don't like and
[02:11:42.240 --> 02:11:49.240]  they say okay well now you have no free speech okay ladies and gentlemen this is so horrible
[02:11:49.240 --> 02:11:54.240]  and so dangerous and the fcc's announcing they want to censor the internet they're announcing
[02:11:54.240 --> 02:11:59.240]  they want to control what you can say they want to set up literal soviet soviet means
[02:11:59.240 --> 02:12:05.240]  committees in your towns that are quote private quasi-governmental that then report to the
[02:12:05.240 --> 02:12:10.240]  government and if they complain your radio show your website your film is over the supreme
[02:12:10.240 --> 02:12:16.240]  court already tried this year to ban a film about hillary clinton i mean this is going
[02:12:16.240 --> 02:12:21.240]  on so here's that article please get it out to everyone first amendment ruling destined
[02:12:21.240 --> 02:12:26.240]  to kill internet free speech and i need paul watson tomorrow to do a master article he's
[02:12:26.240 --> 02:12:33.240]  done this before by master click a master key that covers the 10 15 or more key ways they're
[02:12:33.240 --> 02:12:38.240]  killing free speech globally and it's the same thing it's continuity of agenda it's the same
[02:12:38.240 --> 02:12:43.240]  implementation everywhere first amendment ruling destined to kill internet free speech
[02:12:43.240 --> 02:12:47.240]  and the supreme court is saying that quote the justice appeared to incline to set a limit
[02:12:47.240 --> 02:12:52.240]  on free speech when ordinary citizens are targeted with especially personal or hurtful attacks
[02:12:52.240 --> 02:12:59.240]  the first amendment says the government may restrict free speech and it goes on here to
[02:12:59.240 --> 02:13:06.240]  have one justice say this will affect the internet case what's got all the quotes right there
[02:13:06.240 --> 02:13:11.240]  we've also have the other articles that we wrote about it justices signal intent to dismantle
[02:13:11.240 --> 02:13:18.240]  first amendment okay now that dovetails with obama administration pressures isp to censor
[02:13:18.240 --> 02:13:23.240]  websites what did leverman say last year he said that he wants his office to be able to
[02:13:23.240 --> 02:13:28.240]  tell youtube what to take down no judge no jury he's god well now because they couldn't
[02:13:28.240 --> 02:13:34.240]  get cyber security through yet they have officially asked them to give them a list of sites terms
[02:13:34.240 --> 02:13:39.240]  names anything the government asked for them to shut down for isp's to shut down i mean
[02:13:39.240 --> 02:13:46.240]  this is just lawless brazen mafia now what's the new news that is so off the charts so
[02:13:46.240 --> 02:13:53.240]  incredible and i've seen previous quotes by the u n cast sunstein and microsoft people
[02:13:53.240 --> 02:14:01.240]  on this subject and it's going up on info wars dot com right now and i've read over what
[02:14:01.240 --> 02:14:05.240]  microsoft has said i'm going to have the info wars headline changed a bit because it's worse
[02:14:05.240 --> 02:14:12.240]  than what watch and even said microsoft proposal opens door for government licensing to access
[02:14:12.240 --> 02:14:18.240]  internet well that's one of the cornerstones of this internet takeover and on the site they
[02:14:18.240 --> 02:14:24.240]  have a video of microsoft admitting it and microsoft is basically a pentagon front but

[02:17:58.240 --> 02:18:01.240]  to talk about this with andrew napolitano and the federal reserve and a host of other
[02:18:01.240 --> 02:18:05.240]  issues when he joins us a new proposal by a top microsoft executive would open the door
[02:18:05.240 --> 02:18:09.240]  for government licensing to access the internet with authorities being empowered to block
[02:18:09.240 --> 02:18:13.240]  individual computers from connecting to the worldwide web under the pretext of preventing
[02:18:13.240 --> 02:18:17.240]  malware attacks and they're also saying if you ever download something that a company
[02:18:17.240 --> 02:18:23.240]  says with no proof might be copyright your site is gone or your internet access is gone
[02:18:23.240 --> 02:18:28.240]  france is already doing that i mean this is happening okay this is happening last year
[02:18:28.240 --> 02:18:33.240]  they tried to put tens of thousands of websites on a banned list in australia and australia
[02:18:33.240 --> 02:18:38.240]  said the government this is chinese style censorship they said it's good we're doing it
[02:18:38.240 --> 02:18:43.240]  but that got beaten back narrowly but they're back again it look look this can and will
[02:18:43.240 --> 02:18:49.240]  and is happening go read this article this is only one way they're calling for this and
[02:18:49.240 --> 02:18:53.240]  i hope watch and add to the article about how they tried to claim the drudge report had
[02:18:53.240 --> 02:18:58.240]  this virus and it wasn't true and the democrats put out that you know memorandum don't go
[02:18:58.240 --> 02:19:03.240]  to the drudge report because it'll give you a virus total line this is what they're doing
[02:19:03.240 --> 02:19:09.240]  this is how they're operating this is serious they stage that the attack they stage the
[02:19:09.240 --> 02:19:15.240]  crisis or they claim they're fighting a crisis that doesn't exist so the search term is
[02:19:15.240 --> 02:19:20.240]  government licensing internet and then if you make this number one which you've done
[02:19:20.240 --> 02:19:25.240]  in almost every case you've done this 30 something times twice it didn't become number one government

[02:24:12.240 --> 02:24:19.240]  okay it's official the Federal Reserve is now the second largest holder of U.S. Treasury bonds
[02:24:19.240 --> 02:24:24.240]  not only does the Federal Reserve get most of this money that we pay in taxes then we owe them debt
[02:24:24.240 --> 02:24:28.240]  to give them our money that's a good deal if you could make it up if you could write your own deal
[02:24:28.240 --> 02:24:32.240]  that's what you do if you were a crook these swindlers they're setting up a world government
[02:24:32.240 --> 02:24:37.240]  they're financing the movement to make us pay carbon taxes and global VAT taxes are announcing
[02:24:37.240 --> 02:24:43.240]  a world government and now China who they've set up in power is the number one owner of our debt
[02:24:43.240 --> 02:24:53.240]  and we and the United States number two owner is the private Federal Reserve today's POMO is over
[02:24:53.240 --> 02:25:00.240]  at 2.069 billion the operation was right in line with their expectations coming into a total of 12.16
[02:25:00.240 --> 02:25:05.240]  submitted to acceptance ratios investors apparently are not too crazy about the yield perspective
[02:25:05.240 --> 02:25:14.240]  of the U.S. Treasuries however what is far more important is that with holdings of 821.1 billion
[02:25:14.240 --> 02:25:22.240]  821.1 billion 821 plus billion the Fed is now officially the second largest holder of U.S. Treasuries
[02:25:22.240 --> 02:25:29.240]  next to China I mean you talk about being dominated by these criminals you tell the general public
[02:25:29.240 --> 02:25:35.240]  the Federal Reserve owns our debt they don't understand what this means meanwhile the world
[02:25:35.240 --> 02:25:42.240]  does dollar tumbles to fresh 15 year low against yen French news agency precious gold hits record
[02:25:42.240 --> 02:25:50.240]  of 1360 plus food stamp recipients to 41.8 million Americans Bernanke tells the truth
[02:25:50.240 --> 02:25:55.240]  United States is now in the brink of financial disaster JP Morgan thugs break into homes not in
[02:25:55.240 --> 02:26:03.240]  foreclosure and steals them that's mainstream news standard of living plunging I mean this is
[02:26:03.240 --> 02:26:10.240]  incredible 23 million Americans face massive tax hikes Ted Anderson this is insane what does it mean
[02:26:10.240 --> 02:26:15.240]  in your research to have the private Federal Reserve being the second biggest owner of our debt
[02:26:15.240 --> 02:26:22.240]  first China our supposed big enemy and now so communist China boy Wall Street's fighting
[02:26:22.240 --> 02:26:27.240]  commies aren't they well you know the funny thing is that you're talking about the Fed being the
[02:26:27.240 --> 02:26:33.240]  second largest institution that owns U.S. government debt and they get to the actually the
[02:26:33.240 --> 02:26:38.240]  United States government prints the money but the United States government can't use it until
[02:26:38.240 --> 02:26:43.240]  they put it on a semi truck haul it over the Federal Reserve Bank so they can put a stamp on
[02:26:43.240 --> 02:26:47.240]  it to make it okay and then they lend it back to the United States government by buying U.S.
[02:26:47.240 --> 02:26:52.240]  Treasury bonds you can't get a better deal than that Alex I mean I hear these people every now and
[02:26:52.240 --> 02:26:56.240]  then calling it and saying no you shouldn't be getting into gold and silver the Fed owns it
[02:26:56.240 --> 02:27:01.240]  you know what the Federal Reserve system wants you to stay in their fiat money because they
[02:27:01.240 --> 02:27:05.240]  get to have it for nothing and then they lend it to you collect interest on it that's why you're
[02:27:05.240 --> 02:27:11.240]  paying taxes in the first place if it wasn't for the Fed in 1913 we wouldn't have the federal
[02:27:11.240 --> 02:27:17.240]  income tax in 1913 they went hand in hand I mean it just I mean wish people could wake up here in
[02:27:17.240 --> 02:27:23.240]  the United States snap out of it man I tell you it is so much more better at least in my opinion
[02:27:23.240 --> 02:27:29.240]  to own gold or put my wealth into gold that it is to have it stored in this Federal Reserve note
[02:27:29.240 --> 02:27:35.240]  that they have this printing press that's attached to it and they get to devaluate it anytime they
[02:27:35.240 --> 02:27:41.240]  change their policy or choose to do so it's just absolutely insanity when I hear that happen
[02:27:41.240 --> 02:27:46.240]  every now and then when somebody will say well we can own gold because the central banks own gold
[02:27:46.240 --> 02:27:51.240]  well let me tell you something if you store your wealth in the fiat money that they're giving you
[02:27:51.240 --> 02:27:56.240]  you're taking this printed thing that they lend you now you're paying interest back it's just look
[02:27:56.240 --> 02:28:01.240]  that said that's a government disinfo Cohen gel pro op most those people that say that
[02:28:01.240 --> 02:28:05.240]  ignorantly aren't aren't operatives they're just useful idiots as Lenin would say but Ted I've never
[02:28:05.240 --> 02:28:11.240]  heard you this angry because we've been right about everything they're doing it by design they have
[02:28:11.240 --> 02:28:17.240]  effectively destroyed the country and they own the nation through fraud they've literally got us
[02:28:17.240 --> 02:28:25.240]  by by the hair on this one and it gold ran up to all-time high of 1360 plus they're manipulating it
[02:28:25.240 --> 02:28:31.240]  down $11 right now but it's still that that was all-time highs a week ago and you've still got
[02:28:31.240 --> 02:28:35.240]  gold you bought two three weeks ago at the lower price people need to get into golden silver right now
[02:28:35.240 --> 02:28:40.240]  or that in my opinion they're completely insane tell us about the today's offer briefly Ted well
[02:28:40.240 --> 02:28:47.240]  just real quick silver went to $23.48 and I'm offering a creature from Jekyll Island with a silver
[02:28:47.240 --> 02:28:54.240]  dollar for 2645 that was the price I offered it for 15 years ago when I started this push to get these
[02:28:54.240 --> 02:29:01.240]  books in people's hands and we're right now the best deal far beyond anything is that silver
[02:29:01.240 --> 02:29:08.240]  walking Liberty half at $10.83 I mean pick up the frame for us for 289 we get you a full year

[02:33:00.240 --> 02:33:21.240]  we are back live for the rest of this hour judge Andrew
[02:33:21.240 --> 02:33:28.240]  Apollo Tano former state judge number one show now on Fox business going to daily week
[02:33:28.240 --> 02:33:33.240]  days it's so successful just out of nowhere he comes on boom number one I'll guarantee
[02:33:33.240 --> 02:33:39.240]  you they put him on main Fox he would beat everybody on that network even if they put
[02:33:39.240 --> 02:33:43.240]  him at ten o'clock at night and that's what I told him you know six eight months ago when
[02:33:43.240 --> 02:33:47.240]  I knew he was getting his weekend show I said I said you watch it's going to have you know
[02:33:47.240 --> 02:33:52.240]  massive ratings and you're like I just hope to do okay and you remember on air and off
[02:33:52.240 --> 02:33:59.240]  air judge I told you Alex and and you were right and I have been surprised and delighted
[02:33:59.240 --> 02:34:05.240]  that the generosity of viewers we've been doing very very well and management decided to take
[02:34:05.240 --> 02:34:11.240]  a daily and we expect that that will happen before Thanksgiving daily on Fox business
[02:34:11.240 --> 02:34:15.240]  on Fox business we will continue to show on weekends basically we will take one of the
[02:34:15.240 --> 02:34:21.240]  five dailies and run it as the weekend show but our prime work will be prime time I don't
[02:34:21.240 --> 02:34:27.240]  know the time it'll be prime time on the Fox business network with the full support of
[02:34:27.240 --> 02:34:32.240]  the business network and many many cross promotions on the Fox News channel and my continued
[02:34:32.240 --> 02:34:37.240]  appearances on the Fox News channel and my continued fill-ins for Glenn Beck which I'm
[02:34:37.240 --> 02:34:43.240]  doing as soon as next Tuesday are you influencing Glenn because he is getting more and more
[02:34:43.240 --> 02:34:49.240]  hardcore last night we played a clip earlier in the show he talked about the Fabian socialist
[02:34:49.240 --> 02:34:54.240]  wanting to poison the water supply and I don't want to take credit for influencing him I will
[02:34:54.240 --> 02:34:59.240]  tell you this we spend a lot of time together we do a lot of speaking gigs together when
[02:34:59.240 --> 02:35:03.240]  you travel with Glenn you travel first class so we're in a small private jet and we do
[02:35:03.240 --> 02:35:09.240]  a lot of talking he has told me that I have changed his mind on two issues one is the
[02:35:09.240 --> 02:35:15.240]  Patriot Act and the other is the morality lawfulness and constitutionality or lack thereof of
[02:35:15.240 --> 02:35:22.240]  torture so I will only take credit for those two areas which are profound I did not hear
[02:35:22.240 --> 02:35:26.240]  what he said about the Fabian socialist and I didn't hear what he said about poisoning
[02:35:26.240 --> 02:35:31.240]  the water supply until you told me because I was on another show last night when he said
[02:35:31.240 --> 02:35:37.240]  that but I'm not surprised that he said it I'm happy that he's issuing those warnings
[02:35:37.240 --> 02:35:42.240]  and those warnings are resonating with people you've been saying this for years now he's
[02:35:42.240 --> 02:35:47.240]  saying it between the two of you that is a monstrous audience hearing these things well
[02:35:47.240 --> 02:35:53.240]  every day for two years I have shown the quotes from eco science where Holdren said reduced
[02:35:53.240 --> 02:36:00.240]  population of planetary tyranny to do it for sterilization through the water Beck quoted
[02:36:00.240 --> 02:36:07.240]  eco science word for word last night he played George Bernard Shaw I mean literally it's
[02:36:07.240 --> 02:36:12.240]  it's it's and I you know I've been critical of Beck on torture and and the police state
[02:36:12.240 --> 02:36:18.240]  and things he supported but I mean I know it shows one thing the mood of the country
[02:36:18.240 --> 02:36:24.240]  has changed if Judge Andrew Napolitano has the number one show on Fox Business and is
[02:36:24.240 --> 02:36:30.240]  getting a prime time show weekdays and Glenn Beck is now able to go on the air and talk
[02:36:30.240 --> 02:36:36.240]  about things that 15 years ago I was called a lunatic for when all I was doing was reading
[02:36:36.240 --> 02:36:41.240]  comments well you have to add to that they and I'm not just blowing smoke at you you
[02:36:41.240 --> 02:36:46.240]  have to add to that the phenomenal success of your own show people have awakened when
[02:36:46.240 --> 02:36:52.240]  people ask me about the tea parties I take them back to my youth this is before you were
[02:36:52.240 --> 02:36:58.240]  born when Barry Goldwater ran against the LBJ that is the last time I can and I was 13
[02:36:58.240 --> 02:37:04.240]  years old that's the last time I can remember as serious and as profound a debate about
[02:37:04.240 --> 02:37:10.240]  the Constitution and the role of the federal government in the lives of individuals in the
[02:37:10.240 --> 02:37:15.240]  past 50 years and Goldwater came out and quoted the trial lateral commission's plan to set
[02:37:15.240 --> 02:37:20.240]  up world government how the banks would bankrupt us and now here we are 40 something years later
[02:37:20.240 --> 02:37:28.240]  it was like Barry Goldwater was a profit exactly Goldwater was terrific to me the the tea parties
[02:37:28.240 --> 02:37:32.240]  are bringing and they accept on on defense because I think he would have waged offensive
[02:37:32.240 --> 02:37:37.240]  wars which you and I and most of the folks listening to us now would not I agree and and
[02:37:37.240 --> 02:37:42.240]  it's like saying you know aside from what happened in the theater Mrs. Lincoln how did you like
[02:37:42.240 --> 02:37:47.240]  the evening because it's a big accept but generally on the role of the government in
[02:37:47.240 --> 02:37:52.240]  the lives of people generally unlimited government generally on sound money he was
[02:37:52.240 --> 02:37:57.240]  terrific and I'll tell you this Alex when I talk about the virtues of the tea party movement
[02:37:57.240 --> 02:38:02.240]  it could be co-opted you know these guys could get elected and they could become a victims
[02:38:02.240 --> 02:38:07.240]  of Potomac fever I don't think it's going to happen I say it is a return to our Goldwater
[02:38:07.240 --> 02:38:13.240]  roots not our Reagan roots I'd love to Reagan as a human being I loved his sunny cheerful
[02:38:13.240 --> 02:38:19.240]  personality I love his up from the bootstraps story personal story and I love his speeches
[02:38:19.240 --> 02:38:26.240]  but he was not a libertarian that's right his rhetoric was good close I mean his rhetoric
[02:38:26.240 --> 02:38:32.240]  was good but what we got was something entirely different though maybe maybe it's easier to
[02:38:32.240 --> 02:38:36.240]  be a libertarian when you're in the legislative branch and you don't have to administer a
[02:38:36.240 --> 02:38:43.240]  government I will grant you that but Goldwater was far purer far closer to the views of of
[02:38:43.240 --> 02:38:51.240]  Jefferson Mises Hayek and Alex Jones and then Ronald Reagan was okay judge we've only got
[02:38:51.240 --> 02:38:55.240]  you here for about another 20 minutes before the show ends I want to race through a bunch
[02:38:55.240 --> 02:38:59.240]  of issues then find out what is most important on your radar correct but I would imagine
[02:38:59.240 --> 02:39:04.240]  being so well read you know the Supreme Court justices in the LA Times covered this here's
[02:39:04.240 --> 02:39:10.240]  the headline First Amendment ruling destined to kill Internet free speech they said that
[02:39:10.240 --> 02:39:16.240]  in the case of the funeral protesters who I disagree with but it's their right that they
[02:39:16.240 --> 02:39:22.240]  are going to restrict rallies protest things that hurt people's feelings England has just
[02:39:22.240 --> 02:39:27.240]  passed similar laws the cyber security act did this they couldn't pass the cyber bullying
[02:39:27.240 --> 02:39:32.240]  last year and so they're now legislating from the bench they have signaled and said that
[02:39:32.240 --> 02:39:38.240]  they are going to rule against rallies and demonstrations that are hurtful and one justice
[02:39:38.240 --> 02:39:44.240]  said this will also affect Internet speech that then dovetails with Microsoft proposes
[02:39:44.240 --> 02:39:51.240]  government licensing Internet access I mean this can you speak about the state of free
[02:39:51.240 --> 02:39:56.240]  speech in this country here's another one Obama administration pressures ISPs to censor
[02:39:56.240 --> 02:40:02.240]  websites without even an order the White House just tells them what they want taken down
[02:40:02.240 --> 02:40:09.240]  outside of a court and it happens I mean this is becoming Maoist China well I disagree
[02:40:09.240 --> 02:40:14.240]  with the view of those who say the court is going to go against free speech I was not
[02:40:14.240 --> 02:40:20.240]  in the courtroom I read a portion of the transcript of the oral argument and I interrogated the
[02:40:20.240 --> 02:40:25.240]  Fox reporter who was in the courtroom that Fox reporter not a lawyer but a person who
[02:40:25.240 --> 02:40:30.240]  covers the Supreme Court for Fox is of the view that's going to go in favor of free
[02:40:30.240 --> 02:40:35.240]  speech and this court and no court is perfect and a lot of judges most of them legislate
[02:40:35.240 --> 02:40:42.240]  from the bench but this Supreme Court with with Stevens on it before Kagan got there
[02:40:42.240 --> 02:40:48.240]  invalidated laws that prohibited the slaughter of animal on tapes a horrible thing that I
[02:40:48.240 --> 02:40:55.240]  oppose but free speech invalidated laws that prohibited corporations and labor unions and
[02:40:55.240 --> 02:41:01.240]  advocacy groups from getting involved in in free speech I believe that this case is going
[02:41:01.240 --> 02:41:06.240]  to go as horrific as the message is in favor of the freedom of the messengers in this case
[02:41:06.240 --> 02:41:10.240]  okay well let's hope you're right but but and and we'll find out soon but the other
[02:41:10.240 --> 02:41:15.240]  issue is what about all these moves with cyber security the Obama kill switch all these
[02:41:15.240 --> 02:41:19.240]  different stuff has to be challenged and has to be challenged in a couple ways one the
[02:41:19.240 --> 02:41:23.240]  way you're doing it by exposing it because most people don't know about this unless they
[02:41:23.240 --> 02:41:28.240]  hear it from you or or or Sassel or Beck or me because there are very few national
[02:41:28.240 --> 02:41:33.240]  broadcasters addressing this and secondly it needs to be challenged in the political arena
[02:41:33.240 --> 02:41:37.240]  the people who do it need to be voted out of office or exposed and forced to explain
[02:41:37.240 --> 02:41:41.240]  themselves in which case they'll be forced out of office and then of course it needs
[02:41:41.240 --> 02:41:47.240]  to be challenged but the court has been pretty good on First Amendment I mean the court
[02:41:47.240 --> 02:41:53.240]  has let circuit court opinions stand which invalidated efforts to cleanse the internet
[02:41:53.240 --> 02:41:57.240]  of pornography whatever you think of pornography these things were written supposedly to
[02:41:57.240 --> 02:42:01.240]  protect children it's always for the children and circuit courts of appeals that's the
[02:42:01.240 --> 02:42:06.240]  Intermediate Appellate Court throughout the country have invalidated legislation under
[02:42:06.240 --> 02:42:11.240]  Clinton under Bush and under Obama and the Supreme Court has refused to accept the
[02:42:11.240 --> 02:42:16.240]  government's appeals to overturn those invalidations so they haven't been bad on the
[02:42:16.240 --> 02:42:22.240]  First Amendment now we run the risk of a social conservative like my college
[02:42:22.240 --> 02:42:29.240]  classmate Sam Alito joining the big government liberals we run that risk of
[02:42:29.240 --> 02:42:35.240]  them thinking what they know is best for us to watch and listen to in here but if
[02:42:35.240 --> 02:42:41.240]  Justice Alito sticks to the guns so to speak of those who voted for the First
[02:42:41.240 --> 02:42:46.240]  Amendment the last time around I think the First Amendment will prevail well
[02:42:46.240 --> 02:42:50.240]  even if the court says we don't have a First Amendment possession is nine
[02:42:50.240 --> 02:42:55.240]  tenths of the law we need to continue to exercise it just like McCain Feingold
[02:42:55.240 --> 02:43:00.240]  tried to block free speech people just ignored it absolutely absolutely I mean
[02:43:00.240 --> 02:43:08.240]  the other thing is I mean the the the the judgment against Phillips here was
[02:43:08.240 --> 02:43:13.240]  provided under some Maryland law now some states would not have such laws
[02:43:13.240 --> 02:43:17.240]  some states would say you can stand on the sidewalk and say whatever you want
[02:43:17.240 --> 02:43:23.240]  this creates the bizarre conundrum of the First Amendment meaning different things
[02:43:23.240 --> 02:43:27.240]  in different states so if the Supreme Court says this is okay we're going to
[02:43:27.240 --> 02:43:31.240]  uphold this judgment to about eight million dollars which the church doesn't
[02:43:31.240 --> 02:43:36.240]  have so it may just be a paper judgment that may not be the law of the land in all
[02:43:36.240 --> 02:43:41.240]  50 states of my own home state of New Jersey regrettably one of the most
[02:43:41.240 --> 02:43:47.240]  progressive in the Union nevertheless is superb on free speech under new to the
[02:43:47.240 --> 02:43:50.240]  New Jersey Constitution you can stand on the street corner and say whatever you
[02:43:50.240 --> 02:43:54.240]  want to whom ever you want at any time you want as long as you're not you know
[02:43:54.240 --> 02:43:58.240]  preventing people from walking or preventing traffic I understand judge
[02:43:58.240 --> 02:44:03.240]  on this legal issues obviously you can teach us all day and we appreciate you
[02:44:03.240 --> 02:44:07.240]  joining us on that subject but but last question when should the court then
[02:44:07.240 --> 02:44:12.240]  release their ruling in the next two three months you know they release a
[02:44:12.240 --> 02:44:16.240]  bunch of rulings three times right before Christmas in the middle of the
[02:44:16.240 --> 02:44:21.240]  spring or say around April and then in June I think this one's probably going to
[02:44:21.240 --> 02:44:25.240]  come in April I don't think this is going to come until next year not for any
[02:44:25.240 --> 02:44:29.240]  political reason but just because the process of getting something like this
[02:44:29.240 --> 02:44:34.240]  done takes time okay I've got a stack of other important issues you talked about
[02:44:34.240 --> 02:44:38.240]  the Federal Reserve getting more power it did get more power out of the crisis
[02:44:38.240 --> 02:44:43.240]  it created right they were able to block a true audit in the Senate now it's
[02:44:43.240 --> 02:44:51.240]  being reported that 821.1 billion of US Treasury notes are now owned by the
[02:44:51.240 --> 02:44:55.240]  private Federal Reserve they are now the second biggest owner of our debt
[02:44:55.240 --> 02:45:01.240]  next to communist China the Federal Reserve is moving ahead with the
[02:45:01.240 --> 02:45:05.240]  quantitative easing the dollar is plunging gold is going up it's becoming
[02:45:05.240 --> 02:45:11.240]  more and more clear that we have a financial military style occupation of
[02:45:11.240 --> 02:45:16.240]  our country and the bankers are getting record bonuses they're openly not
[02:45:16.240 --> 02:45:20.240]  telling Congress where the trillions are this is insane give us your take on
[02:45:20.240 --> 02:45:24.240]  the Federal Reserve being the second biggest owner of our debt I mean talk
[02:45:24.240 --> 02:45:28.240]  about national security a private banking cartel and the communist Chinese I
[02:45:28.240 --> 02:45:32.240]  mean this is incredible well I actually think it's worse than that Alex I was
[02:45:32.240 --> 02:45:36.240]  on air with one of my colleagues speculating about what might happen if
[02:45:36.240 --> 02:45:41.240]  the Republicans take the House and the Republicans take the Senate and the
[02:45:41.240 --> 02:45:45.240]  colleagues said well at least they can refuse to fund ten reg the Financial
[02:45:45.240 --> 02:45:51.240]  Regulatory Act the so-called Dodd Frank Act and I said well most respectfully
[02:45:51.240 --> 02:45:55.240]  they can't it's under the domain of the Federal Reserve it doesn't need any
[02:45:55.240 --> 02:45:59.240]  funding the Federal Reserve can print its own money and funded itself so the
[02:45:59.240 --> 02:46:03.240]  Federal Reserve is probably the most powerful entity on the planet more
[02:46:03.240 --> 02:46:07.240]  powerful than the rest of the federal government combined it's certainly the
[02:46:07.240 --> 02:46:11.240]  most secretive this is a one-liner you that you've used the job of the CIA is
[02:46:11.240 --> 02:46:16.240]  to keep and to steal secrets we know more about the CIA and what it has kept
[02:46:16.240 --> 02:46:20.240]  and what it has stolen and then then we do about the Federal Reserve and the
[02:46:20.240 --> 02:46:25.240]  Federal Reserve announced yesterday that it's ready to in infuse another
[02:46:25.240 --> 02:46:30.240]  trillion dollars of cash into the marketplace what will that do to the
[02:46:30.240 --> 02:46:35.240]  value of the dollar in the wallet of everybody listening in the bank account
[02:46:35.240 --> 02:46:38.240]  of everybody listening invested in the business of everyone listening who's
[02:46:38.240 --> 02:46:42.240]  invested in a business and invested in the home of everyone listening who owns
[02:46:42.240 --> 02:46:47.240]  a home it will decrease its value when Jefferson and company were running
[02:46:47.240 --> 02:46:54.240]  the government in 1792 the Congress enacted the Coinage Act of 1792 which
[02:46:54.240 --> 02:47:00.240]  made it punishable by death for anybody in the government to clip coins stated
[02:47:00.240 --> 02:47:07.240]  differently to devalue the money the Federal Reserve is doing exactly that
[02:47:07.240 --> 02:47:12.240]  which was death penalty eligible when sound money existed in the country this
[02:47:12.240 --> 02:47:17.240]  is the most serious of problems we face we need to audit the Federal Reserve we
[02:47:17.240 --> 02:47:22.240]  need to audit gold knock for it knocks and I mean a real audit we may open up
[02:47:22.240 --> 02:47:26.240]  the door and find a a stadium full of gold but we need it could be
[02:47:26.240 --> 02:47:30.240]  hypothecated it could be pledged it could be there but owned by by the bank of
[02:47:30.240 --> 02:47:34.240]  China we need to own who owned we need to know who owns what we need to know
[02:47:34.240 --> 02:47:38.240]  every penny the Federal Reserve has has printed every dime the Federal Reserve
[02:47:38.240 --> 02:47:42.240]  has spent every quarter the Federal Reserve has loaned every dollar the Federal
[02:47:42.240 --> 02:47:47.240]  Reserve is expecting back now are we gonna get that I just put this question
[02:47:47.240 --> 02:47:52.240]  to Ron Paul not an hour ago in the taping of my weekend show he thinks
[02:47:52.240 --> 02:47:56.240]  we're going to get these answers but not tomorrow and not as a result of this
[02:47:56.240 --> 02:48:00.240]  election and not even during the presidency of this president but in our
[02:48:00.240 --> 02:48:05.240]  lifetimes he thinks we will reach such a crisis point which he calls a
[02:48:05.240 --> 02:48:10.240]  revolution where the government will be forced to expose what it's been doing
[02:48:10.240 --> 02:48:14.240]  what it owns what it's been cheating what it's been stealing or the government
[02:48:14.240 --> 02:48:17.240]  will collapse like the government of the Soviet Union did well judge that's
[02:48:17.240 --> 02:48:22.240]  the issue is that you have the Vatican you have the city of London within
[02:48:22.240 --> 02:48:26.240]  London the private banking group you have Cheney a few years ago saying I'm
[02:48:26.240 --> 02:48:30.240]  my own branch of government the Federal Reserve has actually gotten
[02:48:30.240 --> 02:48:35.240]  Congress to legislate that they are literally the foxes guarding the
[02:48:35.240 --> 02:48:41.240]  hen houses they are destroying our society and they are the US version of
[02:48:41.240 --> 02:48:46.240]  the most powerful thing on the planet the private banking cartel that is now
[02:48:46.240 --> 02:48:51.240]  openly announcing world government it's either us or them and Ron Paul put out
[02:48:51.240 --> 02:48:55.240]  a video that's up on prisonplanet.com we've got him on tomorrow by the way
[02:48:55.240 --> 02:48:59.240]  and I'm gonna I'm gonna ask ask me about this but he said basically what you
[02:48:59.240 --> 02:49:02.240]  just said he said we're now with that critical juncture or entering it where
[02:49:02.240 --> 02:49:06.240]  either they're gonna collapse the economy use that as an excuse for
[02:49:06.240 --> 02:49:11.240]  martial law or they've miscalculated and we're gonna be able to get our
[02:49:11.240 --> 02:49:16.240]  country back but regardless we're entering waters that are extremely
[02:49:16.240 --> 02:49:22.240]  violent the fireworks have just begun we are at such a critical juncture can you
[02:49:22.240 --> 02:49:28.240]  speak to that well the Ron Paul did say pretty much the same thing to me it
[02:49:28.240 --> 02:49:33.240]  means he's fearless and he's consistent and he's the most effective
[02:49:33.240 --> 02:49:38.240]  watcher of the government from inside the government that we have but he says
[02:49:38.240 --> 02:49:42.240]  that two things are going to happen and I agree with him the revolution which we
[02:49:42.240 --> 02:49:46.240]  are in the early stages of will first cause our empire to crumble I mean we
[02:49:46.240 --> 02:49:53.240]  simply will not be able to finance over 900 permanent military installations
[02:49:53.240 --> 02:49:59.240]  all around the globe and those people will be free from our occupation they
[02:49:59.240 --> 02:50:04.240]  will be bereft of us spending cash there but we'll have more cash to spend here
[02:50:04.240 --> 02:50:08.240]  at home that's the first stage of the revolution now the second stage of the
[02:50:08.240 --> 02:50:12.240]  revolution in his view and in mine is sort of like what happened when the
[02:50:12.240 --> 02:50:17.240]  Soviet Union fell when the Soviet Union fell the countries that it had occupied
[02:50:17.240 --> 02:50:23.240]  from before during and after World War two became free countries and many of
[02:50:23.240 --> 02:50:27.240]  them became freer than the United States in terms of the engine of the free
[02:50:27.240 --> 02:50:32.240]  market a truly free market somewhat even a flat tax driving great great
[02:50:32.240 --> 02:50:37.240]  prosperity and educating people in private schools which you could afford
[02:50:37.240 --> 02:50:41.240]  to send your children to because your taxes were lower and people had more
[02:50:41.240 --> 02:50:48.240]  money to invest etc that might result in things like Texas saying to
[02:50:48.240 --> 02:50:54.240]  Washington DC stay the heck out when we join to this country our resolution
[02:50:54.240 --> 02:50:58.240]  which was enacted by the Texas legislature in the Congress said we can
[02:50:58.240 --> 02:51:04.240]  leave whenever we want guess what that time has come that may actually happen
[02:51:04.240 --> 02:51:08.240]  and that's why it's called the lone star state but but also New Hampshire has
[02:51:08.240 --> 02:51:12.240]  article 10 right to revolt I mean you know if the central government made a deal
[02:51:12.240 --> 02:51:16.240]  with the king of England to take over America again the states all have that
[02:51:16.240 --> 02:51:20.240]  right to revolt but obviously Texas and New Hampshire as you know judge have the
[02:51:20.240 --> 02:51:24.240]  strongest correct in writing Alex figuratively and literally in writing
[02:51:24.240 --> 02:51:28.240]  that they have the right to do it I mean I don't know how how strong
[02:51:28.240 --> 02:51:32.240]  governor Perry is personally I have discussed this with him off the record
[02:51:32.240 --> 02:51:37.240]  and I'm going to be with him in Houston on Monday but this is a very serious
[02:51:37.240 --> 02:51:41.240]  issue which resonates with many people in Texas it resonates with many people
[02:51:41.240 --> 02:51:47.240]  around the world look earlier this week a federal judge in Montana ruled that
[02:51:47.240 --> 02:51:53.240]  handguns made entirely in Montana of raw material taken from the earth in
[02:51:53.240 --> 02:51:59.240]  Montana using ammunition made entirely in Montana taken from raw material from
[02:51:59.240 --> 02:52:04.240]  the earth in Montana that never left Montana were engaged in interstate
[02:52:04.240 --> 02:52:08.240]  commerce and therefore could be regulated by the federal government I hope
[02:52:08.240 --> 02:52:13.240]  and pray that that is overruled but it is so nonsensical so violative of
[02:52:13.240 --> 02:52:18.240]  people's natural rights that at some point people simply won't listen to
[02:52:18.240 --> 02:52:25.240]  or abide by a decision as weird wacky unconstitutional and unnatural as that
[02:52:25.240 --> 02:52:31.240]  so these boomlets of freedom these drawing of the lines to Washington saying
[02:52:31.240 --> 02:52:35.240]  thou shalt not pass are happening throughout the country and the government
[02:52:35.240 --> 02:52:40.240]  itself is causing them to happen judge I want to shift gears into a similar
[02:52:40.240 --> 02:52:47.240]  issue USA today McDonald's 29 other firms get health care coverage waivers
[02:52:47.240 --> 02:52:52.240]  that's just like when Obama came out in Congress if a GM dealership had given
[02:52:52.240 --> 02:52:56.240]  a lot of money to a local Democrat Congress person they could keep their
[02:52:56.240 --> 02:53:00.240]  dealership but if they were Republican or hadn't given the protection money
[02:53:00.240 --> 02:53:05.240]  they would have it taken away when the feds took over GM is this not pure
[02:53:05.240 --> 02:53:11.240]  discrimination pure selective enforcement pure unfair weights and measures to
[02:53:11.240 --> 02:53:18.240]  say that 30 major mega US companies out of 29 million small companies that get
[02:53:18.240 --> 02:53:21.240]  discriminated against they have to buy health insurance for their employees
[02:53:21.240 --> 02:53:27.240]  and or basically shut down but 30 big companies they're exempt I mean is that
[02:53:27.240 --> 02:53:33.240]  not just totally mafia well it's totally mafia it's also totally unconstitutional
[02:53:33.240 --> 02:53:38.240]  the framers feared this you know a Jefferson and and Hamilton rarely
[02:53:38.240 --> 02:53:41.240]  agreed on anything in public but they both agreed that when the public
[02:53:41.240 --> 02:53:46.240]  treasury becomes a public trough and the people learned that they will send to
[02:53:46.240 --> 02:53:49.240]  Washington only those who will promise to give them the biggest piece of the
[02:53:49.240 --> 02:53:54.240]  federal pie and they're right I mean when when General Motors was going to close
[02:53:54.240 --> 02:53:59.240]  down an enormous warehouse not a dealership but a warehouse in Dorchester
[02:53:59.240 --> 02:54:04.240]  Massachusetts they got a little phone call and suddenly that warehouse was off
[02:54:04.240 --> 02:54:08.240]  the list of facilities to be closed now who represents Dorchester Massachusetts
[02:54:08.240 --> 02:54:13.240]  in the House of Representatives Congressman Barney Frank who supervised the
[02:54:13.240 --> 02:54:18.240]  federal bailout of General Motors so the framers knew that the government
[02:54:18.240 --> 02:54:22.240]  couldn't operate a business because the government would operate it like it
[02:54:22.240 --> 02:54:26.240]  operates the Post Office or like it operates Amtrak or Medicare or Medicaid
[02:54:26.240 --> 02:54:30.240]  or Social Security or I can operate it the must exactly but judge look it over
[02:54:30.240 --> 02:54:34.240]  it'll collapse it'll be running a political model instead of an economic
[02:54:34.240 --> 02:54:38.240]  model the government's patrons and friends yes we'll get rich at our expense
[02:54:38.240 --> 02:54:41.240]  yes and you it turns into a banana republic because nobody can produce
[02:54:41.240 --> 02:54:46.240]  because it just gets stolen from you so now you're not the U.S. your Guatemala
[02:54:46.240 --> 02:54:51.240]  or your Tsarist Russia now expanding on the whole geopolitical outlook
[02:54:51.240 --> 02:54:56.240]  clearly the Rand Corporation said this two years ago you've got Obama people
[02:54:56.240 --> 02:55:01.240]  Robert Shapiro telling the Financial Times of London minus in Oklahoma City
[02:55:01.240 --> 02:55:05.240]  or a 9-11 to make him look strong they're not going to be able to get their agenda
[02:55:05.240 --> 02:55:09.240]  through now Obama's issuing terror alerts right ahead of the election even
[02:55:09.240 --> 02:55:13.240]  mainstream media says you know that it looks like an October surprise kind of
[02:55:13.240 --> 02:55:17.240]  like Governor Ridge admitted they were issuing fake terror alerts in 2004
[02:55:17.240 --> 02:55:21.240]  right for the Bush administration I'm concerned they're going to try to start
[02:55:21.240 --> 02:55:27.240]  a wider global war as a pretext to have the Empire expand and not implode
[02:55:27.240 --> 02:55:32.240]  your take on that I agree with you you know it's a truism going back to
[02:55:32.240 --> 02:55:35.240]  well going back to the time of George Washington but articulated by the
[02:55:35.240 --> 02:55:40.240]  the late great Marine Corps General Smedley Butler and articulated brilliantly
[02:55:40.240 --> 02:55:45.240]  by Professor Bob Higgs war is the health of the state and both parties
[02:55:45.240 --> 02:55:48.240]  are the war party you know the Republicans like certain things the
[02:55:48.240 --> 02:55:51.240]  Democrats like certain things but they both like war because they can scare
[02:55:51.240 --> 02:55:55.240]  people into surrendering their property and their freedom to the government
[02:55:55.240 --> 02:55:59.240]  George Orwell predicted this brilliantly in 1984 in which he
[02:55:59.240 --> 02:56:04.240]  a war that was permanently a world that was permanently at war or a world
[02:56:04.240 --> 02:56:09.240]  that thought it was permanently at war so the government could always micromanage it
[02:56:09.240 --> 02:56:16.240]  this this president can claim to be as benign and pacifist oriented as he wants
[02:56:16.240 --> 02:56:22.240]  George Bush could have claimed to be as more interested in in domestic affairs
[02:56:22.240 --> 02:56:27.240]  and having no interest in foreign affairs as he wants they both want war
[02:56:27.240 --> 02:56:31.240]  because it lets them be a little prince and every president that has that has
[02:56:31.240 --> 02:56:35.240]  waged the war has acted like a little prince and most of the powers that we
[02:56:35.240 --> 02:56:39.240]  have given to those presidents at war time the presidency still has
[02:56:39.240 --> 02:56:43.240]  they get to act as a prince for their special interest in loose society but
[02:56:43.240 --> 02:56:48.240]  they've now basically killed the golden goose they destroyed us and finally
[02:56:48.240 --> 02:56:53.240]  I just wanted to note the New York Times rogue trader at Sociology General gets
[02:56:53.240 --> 02:56:58.240]  three years in prison had to pay 4.9 billion euros of the ill-gotten money
[02:56:58.240 --> 02:57:01.240]  I want to make sure all these fellow reserve owners who were involved in the
[02:57:01.240 --> 02:57:05.240]  swindle I want to make sure they've got to pay that money back into the treasury
[02:57:05.240 --> 02:57:09.240]  for the crimes they've committed briefly do you agree I do and one of the things
[02:57:09.240 --> 02:57:12.240]  I'm going to ask Ron Paul is when you become president will you have your
[02:57:12.240 --> 02:57:16.240]  attorney general and take the federal reserve members who robbed and stole
[02:57:16.240 --> 02:57:20.240]  from us blind you've also got Colonel Anthony Schaefer from what I've heard
[02:57:20.240 --> 02:57:23.240]  with some of the most bombshell information dealing with the cover-up of 9-11
