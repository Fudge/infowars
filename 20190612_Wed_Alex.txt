[00:00.000 --> 00:08.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Wednesday, June 12, 2019.
[00:08.920 --> 00:13.280]  Trump is getting ready to launch counterattacks against Big Tech censorship, and I'm very
[00:13.280 --> 00:16.460]  proud of the fact that Imple Wars has been at the tip of the spear confronting the heads
[00:16.460 --> 00:17.960]  of Big Tech.
[00:17.960 --> 00:25.960]  Google would love to have me arrested and killed, guaranteed.
[00:25.960 --> 00:30.360]  I am here because there is a concerted effort by the Democratic Party and multinational
[00:30.360 --> 00:34.960]  corporations in Big Tech to silence conservative and nationalist and populist voices.
[00:34.960 --> 00:40.080]  Infowars founder Alex Jones is calling out alleged collusion between Google and Democrats.
[00:40.080 --> 00:44.760]  Sundar, you know Google is helping China with Dragonfly, and you know that they're helping
[00:44.760 --> 00:48.880]  censor, and you know that you've sold this country out, and you won't even help the
[00:48.880 --> 00:50.520]  Pentagon, you'll help the Chicoms.
[00:50.520 --> 00:52.320]  You bet on the wrong country, Sundar.
[00:52.320 --> 00:55.760]  We're aware of his lying to Congress, we're aware of him and the Dragonfly Project that's
[00:55.760 --> 00:58.560]  already been operational for years inside the Chinese government.
[00:58.560 --> 01:00.760]  Now it's just being rolled out to the general public.
[01:00.760 --> 01:02.880]  Sundar, you're engaged in treason.
[01:02.880 --> 01:05.880]  You've had Google executives lie to Congress, you're not censoring conservatives.
[01:05.880 --> 01:10.720]  The Big Tech companies and the head of Apple admit that they met with Senator Warner, who's
[01:10.720 --> 01:15.240]  running this whole thing, to begin shutting down conservatives or the Democrats threatened
[01:15.240 --> 01:18.840]  to federalize Big Tech if they did not basically roll over to them.
[01:18.840 --> 01:24.040]  I know we had Alex Jones in the room earlier promoting conspiracy theories.
[01:24.040 --> 01:28.600]  Alex Jones obviously is one of the conspiracy theorists whose brand is bullying.
[01:28.600 --> 01:32.200]  You didn't call me to testify in America, I have a right to fix my accusers, and you
[01:32.200 --> 01:34.640]  Congressman Deutsch are a liar and a fraud.
[01:34.640 --> 01:38.640]  Google is evil, Google is evil, Google is evil.
[01:38.640 --> 01:44.760]  Twitter is planning to permanently suspend Alex Jones' personal account at InfoWars.
[01:44.760 --> 01:50.360]  This comes after Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey was on Capitol Hill yesterday speaking with lawmakers.
[01:50.360 --> 01:56.200]  There it gives Alex Jones the boot, the social networking site permanently banning he and
[01:56.200 --> 01:58.200]  his media company InfoWars.
[01:58.200 --> 02:01.200]  I appreciate your first amendment.
[02:01.200 --> 02:02.960]  But I have a right to fix my accusers, Jack.
[02:02.960 --> 02:05.160]  They're lying about me and they're trying to de-platform me.
[02:05.160 --> 02:09.640]  26 companies working in concert, violating the Sherman-Eddie Trust Act, and now Senator
[02:09.640 --> 02:13.160]  Warner and Senator Wyden have said, quote, there's thousands of sites worse than Alex
[02:13.160 --> 02:14.160]  Jones.
[02:14.160 --> 02:17.480]  So we're becoming like Cuba, we're becoming like Vietnam, we're becoming like China.
[02:17.480 --> 02:22.040]  So regardless of what we'll think about me or the straw men, should I have a first amendment
[02:22.040 --> 02:25.880]  or should these companies be able to violate the whole Safe Arbor Act and all that and
[02:25.880 --> 02:27.360]  then ban conservatives en masse?
[02:27.360 --> 02:30.200]  Yeah, I don't know anything about your site, man.
[02:30.200 --> 02:35.480]  And we're also standing up to social media censorship.
[02:35.480 --> 02:36.480]  That's the new thing.
[02:36.480 --> 02:41.760]  Our interview was cut short because he was confronted by Alex Jones at InfoWars right
[02:41.760 --> 02:42.760]  here in the hallway.
[02:42.760 --> 02:43.760]  It's weird, man.
[02:43.760 --> 02:44.760]  Oh, yeah, it's really weird.
[02:44.760 --> 02:45.760]  There's no purge of conservatives.
[02:45.760 --> 02:46.760]  I don't know.
[02:46.760 --> 02:49.120]  Are you concerned about bias in social media?
[02:49.120 --> 02:50.120]  Yeah, who's this guy?
[02:50.120 --> 02:51.120]  We deployed him.
[02:51.120 --> 02:52.640]  Are you concerned about bias in social media?
[02:52.640 --> 02:55.760]  Well, I think the bigger bias is against freedom of expression.
[02:55.760 --> 02:56.760]  Everybody should be.
[02:56.760 --> 02:57.760]  There's a look.
[02:57.760 --> 02:58.760]  I support going after him.
[02:58.760 --> 02:59.760]  It's happening here, but you said I don't exist.
[02:59.760 --> 03:00.760]  Is that a heckler?
[03:00.760 --> 03:01.760]  I depress the gaggle.
[03:01.760 --> 03:02.760]  Look at this guy.
[03:02.760 --> 03:04.760]  He's saying that I don't exist and there do you want me?
[03:04.760 --> 03:05.760]  I just don't know who you are, man.
[03:05.760 --> 03:06.760]  I don't read a weird website.
[03:06.760 --> 03:07.760]  Sure.
[03:07.760 --> 03:10.760]  And they demonize me and these very hearings and then he plays dumb.
[03:10.760 --> 03:11.760]  Here's the question.
[03:11.760 --> 03:12.760]  InfoWars.com, you know what it is.
[03:12.760 --> 03:13.760]  Oh, well.
[03:13.760 --> 03:14.760]  Does Google, does Facebook.
[03:14.760 --> 03:16.760]  That's why you need to be regulated.
[03:16.760 --> 03:18.760]  Like, do they need to be regulated?
[03:18.760 --> 03:20.760]  Mark Arubio, the snake.
[03:20.760 --> 03:21.760]  Little friend boy here.
[03:21.760 --> 03:22.760]  All right, man.
[03:22.760 --> 03:23.760]  Yeah.
[03:23.760 --> 03:24.760]  Who are you?
[03:24.760 --> 03:25.760]  Yeah, sure.
[03:25.760 --> 03:26.760]  You better hope you can be platforming.
[03:26.760 --> 03:27.760]  Tens of billions of views.
[03:27.760 --> 03:28.760]  InfoWars.
[03:28.760 --> 03:29.760]  Better than Russian Lembaugh.
[03:29.760 --> 03:30.760]  He knows who InfoWars is.
[03:30.760 --> 03:31.760]  Playing this joke over here.
[03:31.760 --> 03:32.760]  That's why the de-platforming didn't work.
[03:32.760 --> 03:36.440]  The most prominent casualty of the crusade against free expression has been the radio
[03:36.440 --> 03:37.760]  show host Alex Jones.
[03:37.760 --> 03:43.060]  For many on the left, the views seem to have become that if you can't beat them, prevent
[03:43.060 --> 03:44.160]  them from speaking.
[03:44.160 --> 03:47.660]  On Twitter, the top tweet links to an InfoWars story.
[03:47.660 --> 03:53.800]  This is a real-time example of when we talk about this information being weaponized.
[03:53.800 --> 03:55.160]  The system self-corrected.
[03:55.160 --> 03:57.760]  That shouldn't be the first tweet you see anymore.
[03:57.760 --> 04:00.160]  It should be a USA article the last time I checked.
[04:00.160 --> 04:02.160]  Yes, you saw this.
[04:02.160 --> 04:03.160]  USA Today.
[04:03.160 --> 04:04.160]  At lunch, I did.
[04:04.160 --> 04:07.160]  Yeah, and I also saw the system corrected.
[04:07.160 --> 04:11.320]  Even the New York Times calls it a crackdown on conservatives and a plan to de-platform
[04:11.320 --> 04:15.000]  conservatives from the Internet and communicating with each other.
[04:15.000 --> 04:16.000]  Just like Communist China.
[04:16.000 --> 04:21.800]  We need you to act now and move against big tech censorship, President Trump.
[04:21.800 --> 04:25.680]  CNN and the Democrats, you know, are destroying the First Amendment and these will be stood
[04:25.680 --> 04:26.680]  up against.
[04:26.680 --> 04:30.320]  These are very extreme individuals and no matter what anyone tells you, they are extremists
[04:30.320 --> 04:33.320]  and that's why Facebook decided to get rid of them.
[04:33.320 --> 04:34.320]  Look at this right there.
[04:34.320 --> 04:39.200]  The guy that goes around policing and calling for censorship and then claims that Trump's
[04:39.200 --> 04:41.880]  wrong, there's no censorship with conservatives or patriots.
[04:41.880 --> 04:42.880]  You are incredibly shameful.
[04:42.880 --> 04:43.880]  How are you doing, Alex?
[04:43.880 --> 04:49.720]  You're just a, look at you, look, you are literally an anti-American, anti-free speech
[04:49.720 --> 04:50.720]  coward.
[04:50.720 --> 04:54.920]  Shame on the mainstream corporate media for not defending the First Amendment, but instead
[04:54.920 --> 04:57.520]  attack logging, calling for federal regulators.
[04:57.520 --> 05:01.360]  We'll be back folks, stay with us.

[06:24.000 --> 06:28.800]  It's not like some fake warning from Al Gore that if you don't pay him carbon tax money,
[06:28.800 --> 06:33.640]  the seas will flood all of the major coastal cities by 2013.
[06:33.640 --> 06:43.760]  He said that in 2000, or AOC, saying the world will end in 11 years, 12 years.
[06:43.760 --> 06:49.000]  No, ladies and gentlemen, it's a real threat of the world ending, and Putin says there's
[06:49.000 --> 06:55.160]  a good chance the world will end, and that we have to prepare to decide whether we want
[06:55.160 --> 06:59.520]  to go to heaven or hell, and that's what really matters, is that the Russians should get their
[06:59.520 --> 07:02.440]  spirits ready and get right with God.
[07:02.440 --> 07:06.200]  He warned that last year, he's issued a new dire warning, it's coming up in a few minutes
[07:06.200 --> 07:12.360]  ladies and gentlemen, but first, I wanted to remind folks just how serious this fight is
[07:12.360 --> 07:17.360]  and how important this broadcast is, and how thankful we are to all of you out there, and
[07:17.360 --> 07:22.440]  how thankful we are of people like Matt Drudge, who has two of our stories top linked, about
[07:22.440 --> 07:27.120]  the incredible invasion that looks like something out of Day of the Dead, people literally crawling
[07:27.120 --> 07:37.840]  out of manholes in Texas, African invaders with their allies attacking our cameraman
[07:37.840 --> 07:44.200]  marching in the dead of night, I mean, it's beyond insane, but the cops are going to pull
[07:44.200 --> 07:48.680]  you over and ask where's your license and registration, if you're a citizen, the book
[07:48.680 --> 07:53.080]  will be thrown at you, but if you're an illegal alien, you're above the law and a God.
[07:53.080 --> 07:57.280]  It's all coming up today, but first, here's an important note from constitutional lawyer
[07:57.280 --> 07:58.280]  Bob Barnes.
[07:58.280 --> 08:07.560]  So, the Info Wars model is a self-fulfilling, self-supporting structure that is in the ultimate
[08:07.560 --> 08:13.600]  economic, little d-democracy structure that is promoting free press and free speech by
[08:13.600 --> 08:18.160]  people getting together and supporting one another and sustaining one another.
[08:18.160 --> 08:24.160]  It is the only independent press of this size and scale, of this public reach, it's reach
[08:24.160 --> 08:28.400]  so effective that that's why Facebook is waging war against Info Wars, that's why Instagram
[08:28.400 --> 08:33.440]  is waging war against Info Wars, that's why Google and YouTube and Twitter are waging war
[08:33.440 --> 08:37.880]  against Info Wars more than anyone else is because it is the ultimate counter-China model.
[08:37.880 --> 08:43.560]  It is the one model that says, here's a way to have a self-supporting, self-sustaining,
[08:43.560 --> 08:48.920]  self-structured, little d-democratic structure that because the audience determines what
[08:48.920 --> 08:54.600]  content goes up, the audience determines what audience is ultimately reached by their choices
[08:54.600 --> 08:55.840]  and supporting Info Wars.
[08:55.840 --> 09:00.920]  So, by doing little things like, okay, we want a little d-democracy, we want a fluoride-free
[09:00.920 --> 09:04.160]  toothpaste, let's say that's what it is, so it's dealing with a particular health issue
[09:04.160 --> 09:08.480]  where you have the health industry pushing one product overwhelmingly, the big pharma,
[09:08.480 --> 09:13.000]  big companies, the corporate model, the Chinese model, the statist corporate model that China
[09:13.000 --> 09:16.480]  has promoted against Info Wars model, which is we're going to have an American-created
[09:16.480 --> 09:20.360]  product, we're going to sell that directly to our own people, our people will decide
[09:20.360 --> 09:24.800]  whether they want to support it or not and by choosing to buy little products like that,
[09:24.800 --> 09:29.040]  they're able to fuel this independent press that is the only one that is not dependent
[09:29.040 --> 09:33.280]  on billionaire donors or sugar deadies, that is not dependent on big corporate sponsors,
[09:33.280 --> 09:37.480]  that is not dependent on getting the approval of the social media giants in order to spread
[09:37.480 --> 09:40.960]  their message and it's all because the audience spends their whatever it is, whether it's
[09:40.960 --> 09:45.880]  $5 or $50 a month on products that they like and that they want that actually compete with
[09:45.880 --> 09:50.680]  the corporate-driven model and the ability to do that and at the same time support press,
[09:50.680 --> 09:54.840]  support speech, support letting the audience choose what news they want to see and what
[09:54.840 --> 09:59.160]  views they want to hold and it's the ultimate American democratic expression and experiment
[09:59.160 --> 10:03.640]  and it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets and doing so
[10:03.640 --> 10:05.640]  in a way that's not corporate-driven.
[10:05.640 --> 10:09.320]  The reason why they don't see news change at Info Wars or content change at Info Wars
[10:09.320 --> 10:13.440]  except as requested or thought about by the audience is because the audience controls
[10:13.440 --> 10:19.080]  it because the audience is chosen as self-supporting, self-sustaining economic model by making small
[10:19.080 --> 10:24.960]  contributions by buying products they already want at a more affordable rate by sustaining
[10:24.960 --> 10:25.960]  it.
[10:25.960 --> 10:29.440]  They create a self-sustaining, self-supporting structure that is unique in the world and
[10:29.440 --> 10:32.680]  that's why they wage war against it and as long as the audience refuses to concede to
[10:32.680 --> 10:37.960]  that or forfeit their economic contribution, as long as they continue to be involved and
[10:37.960 --> 10:42.480]  continue to participate and continue to partake and continue to this self-supporting, self-sustaining
[10:42.480 --> 10:46.600]  structure, there's nothing they can literally do to crush it or end it.
[10:46.600 --> 10:50.120]  They can try to limit the scope of the audience, they can try to limit the size of the microphone
[10:50.120 --> 10:54.080]  but in the end we will find ways to reach them because the audience dictates and determines
[10:54.080 --> 11:00.800]  it by its support of Info Wars.
[11:00.800 --> 11:06.120]  I wanted to really start the broadcast off today with calls for support because the hotter
[11:06.120 --> 11:12.760]  the news, the more listeners we have, the less I talk about our sponsors or the products
[11:12.760 --> 11:19.200]  we sell to fund ourselves and that every time that we can see the traffic and know that
[11:19.200 --> 11:25.880]  things are not super hot, that's when I then try to make it up and fund ourselves.
[11:25.880 --> 11:31.480]  That's the complete opposite of Fox News and CNN, when they've got big stuff going on they
[11:31.480 --> 11:39.200]  increase the amount of ads, we decrease and that's not an algorithm, that's not a plan,
[11:39.200 --> 11:48.960]  that's that when incredible things are happening I just cannot make myself plug or talk about
[11:48.960 --> 11:58.960]  products because there isn't some calculated strategy here at Info Wars other than promoting
[11:58.960 --> 12:05.160]  freedom and warning the people of the world and not backing down to globalism.
[12:05.160 --> 12:10.120]  Globalism is incredibly evil, incredibly unpopular but it's got the megabanks and the big power
[12:10.120 --> 12:16.720]  behind it and so it's a formidable adversary but as we turn the corner against globalism
[12:16.720 --> 12:23.560]  we're starting to, they are intensifying their attacks in a big, big way and so I need the
[12:23.560 --> 12:28.360]  listeners to understand and viewers to understand you are the heart of this entire operation
[12:28.360 --> 12:31.160]  and this fight without you we will not be here.
[12:31.160 --> 12:39.720]  Here's an example, there is a article in the New Haven newspaper, New Trouble for Alex
[12:39.720 --> 12:45.000]  Jones in court fight with Sandy Hook Families and you read this article and it says, yeah
[12:45.000 --> 12:51.360]  he lost the pep in the frog case, that's not true, they spent $1.2 million on something
[12:51.360 --> 12:57.400]  that clearly was fair use and that we didn't really make money off of and Hillary Clinton's
[12:57.400 --> 13:03.720]  law firm ran it and Hillary Clinton's direction that's been in the news, she said the frog
[13:03.720 --> 13:07.760]  was white supremacist so she could say I was a white supremacist, she ruined the frog for
[13:07.760 --> 13:14.360]  the poor guy if he really even owns it and then they go on to say oh and Jones has been
[13:14.360 --> 13:21.880]  caught withholding information and you've got the plaintiffs for the families, you were
[13:21.880 --> 13:27.600]  saying how terrible it is because the judge doesn't know how the internet works and when
[13:27.600 --> 13:33.480]  I go and I watch Congress when Sundar Pichai is up there lying to him, just one lie, whopper
[13:33.480 --> 13:38.760]  lie after another that are documented in their own corporate prospectus document to shareholders,
[13:38.760 --> 13:43.240]  they admit how they game the system and control the search results and make people and he
[13:43.240 --> 13:49.680]  just he lies and it's like he's up there going 2 plus 2 equals $95 billion and the senators
[13:49.680 --> 13:55.680]  don't know because they're lawyers that graduated 50 years ago.
[13:55.680 --> 14:02.720]  It's like telling a wagon wheel maker about rocket science, okay I'm sorry and that's
[14:02.720 --> 14:08.680]  why society is falling apart, the judge says you will give us all Google information on
[14:08.680 --> 14:20.200]  you in the file we know you have, they represented these lawyers, one of them is a former prosecutor
[14:20.200 --> 14:28.160]  appointed by Obama, former US attorney that brought down the governor of the state, this
[14:28.160 --> 14:34.000]  guy knows full well what he's doing, up there going your honor they've got the Google and
[14:34.000 --> 14:42.800]  the judge is like yes they've got the Google, give them the Google, I'm going to be held
[14:42.800 --> 14:48.280]  in contempt, I have an engineer coming in later to show you the Google contracts on
[14:48.280 --> 14:54.200]  air which we've given them and they know the judge doesn't because the judge is again,
[14:54.200 --> 15:00.840]  a judge doesn't know how a cell phone works, I barely do and I've tried to study it but
[15:00.840 --> 15:05.680]  what's so crazy about it is, it isn't about me, it's about the technology gap between
[15:05.680 --> 15:13.600]  older people that run the system and young people that run the tech that literally you
[15:13.600 --> 15:21.360]  can tell these judges and people anything you want and they'll believe it, it's unbelievable.
[15:21.360 --> 15:29.240]  Google analytics is Google's finger touching you, it isn't something we have, we just looked
[15:29.240 --> 15:42.600]  up what it would cost for us to run just a basic report on Google analytics, it's $150,000
[15:42.600 --> 15:47.360]  and it's all mumbo jumbo from Google, we never use Google analytics, other look at
[15:47.360 --> 15:52.040]  general traffic every once in a while, so anyone who's in IT knows this but the judge
[15:52.040 --> 15:59.520]  has ordered us to give them Google, the entire Google database, everything, the whole universe.

[20:25.840 --> 20:37.760]  Okay, let me tell you ladies and gentlemen what we're gonna cover today and then there's
[20:37.760 --> 20:43.320]  more stuff breaking so fast I can't even track it as it unfolds.
[20:43.320 --> 20:54.440]  We have a bunch of clips of the Africa invasion going on
[20:54.440 --> 20:59.840]  that have not been on air yet by their LinkedIn articles on infowars.com, newswars.com and
[20:59.840 --> 21:02.960]  right at the top of drudgerport.com two of our articles are linked there.
[21:02.960 --> 21:07.920]  It's incredible footage, I'll describe it for radio listeners, but our cameraman got
[21:07.920 --> 21:16.120]  assaulted for daring to be across the street politely videotaping and here come the people
[21:16.120 --> 21:21.560]  from a foreign country with the city employees to attack Gregory's and start pushing him
[21:21.560 --> 21:24.880]  out the street and elbowing him.
[21:24.880 --> 21:28.680]  Troyer went in the city facility where all the rest of the media is gone.
[21:28.680 --> 21:33.800]  They came in, started pushing on him, rammed him out and these are just the quote volunteers
[21:33.800 --> 21:40.600]  putting their hands on people because they are again helping collapse the border.
[21:40.600 --> 21:47.960]  We should pull up some footage from Hollywood movies that reenact the fall of a city, the
[21:47.960 --> 21:55.840]  fall of a wall, when a horde pours in, that's all coming up, but just understand we didn't
[21:55.840 --> 21:59.640]  just sit there and wait around and then a few buses would come in.
[21:59.640 --> 22:06.800]  Every hour or so, three, four, five, six, seven buses would pull in and more Africans
[22:06.800 --> 22:08.360]  would get on or get off.
[22:08.360 --> 22:12.200]  So it's been thousands at that one facility and I told you, the board patrol told me two
[22:12.200 --> 22:16.800]  days ago, they said, Alex, it's been over a thousand in the last few weeks, but the
[22:16.800 --> 22:20.240]  numbers are always a few weeks behind that they officially put out.
[22:20.240 --> 22:29.120]  That's why it's on dredgereport.com today that ISIS come out and said that a thousand
[22:29.120 --> 22:34.200]  have come in and 500 at one checkpoint alone from Africa.
[22:34.200 --> 22:40.640]  So exactly what they told me two days ago, what I told you on air is now in the newspapers.
[22:40.640 --> 22:46.280]  And they only reached out to me because Fox News wouldn't cover this and they knew that
[22:46.280 --> 22:50.680]  dredge was picking it up.
[22:50.680 --> 22:55.880]  So again, that's why they want us off air because how many times is an info wars that
[22:55.880 --> 23:02.520]  breaks the story that dredge then amplifies that then it forces mainstream media to cover.
[23:02.520 --> 23:06.480]  We got attacked two weeks ago and they said it's Jones saying that Biden can't talk and
[23:06.480 --> 23:07.480]  it's too old.
[23:07.480 --> 23:09.840]  It's not just me saying that.
[23:09.840 --> 23:11.560]  They were saying that about him years ago.
[23:11.560 --> 23:12.680]  He can barely talk.
[23:12.680 --> 23:14.120]  Look at him.
[23:14.120 --> 23:18.920]  And now it's on the news today that now the Republicans are saying it and they got it
[23:18.920 --> 23:21.160]  from conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[23:21.160 --> 23:25.560]  No, they got it from their own eyeballs.
[23:25.560 --> 23:32.480]  But what dredge is able to do being the largest news site in the world is make them look at
[23:32.480 --> 23:33.920]  things that are really happening.
[23:33.920 --> 23:39.960]  You remember just three, four months ago, John Stuart and everybody else were still saying
[23:39.960 --> 23:44.880]  it because that's where we got our news from, I guess, that there is no migrant crisis and
[23:44.880 --> 23:47.800]  Trump made it up.
[23:47.800 --> 23:52.960]  You don't hear people saying that anymore, do you?
[23:52.960 --> 23:59.720]  Now you hear them saying it's Trump's fault unless it's Bernie Sanders who's got his propaganda
[23:59.720 --> 24:02.080]  a little bit behind the times.
[24:02.080 --> 24:04.640]  Oh, wait, take John Stuart.
[24:04.640 --> 24:13.040]  John Stuart's not one of the nastiest of the fake newsmen, comedians that pose as newsmen,
[24:13.040 --> 24:14.760]  but he's come from a very powerful family.
[24:14.760 --> 24:16.800]  His brother runs the New York Stock Exchange.
[24:16.800 --> 24:19.160]  He knows all about inside baseball in New York.
[24:19.160 --> 24:23.040]  And I see the folks at his press conferences who I originally, three of those guys you
[24:23.040 --> 24:29.760]  see up there testifying were first on this show 18 years ago.
[24:29.760 --> 24:34.680]  They were all the deadly dust that was a cover up.
[24:34.680 --> 24:37.560]  We had scientists on that had tested it.
[24:37.560 --> 24:38.720]  I had toxicologists.
[24:38.720 --> 24:39.880]  I had physicists.
[24:39.880 --> 24:43.920]  We paid to have people go get the dust out of some of the facilities and houses and test
[24:43.920 --> 24:45.880]  it to prove it.
[24:45.880 --> 24:53.120]  Not just the thermite that was in there, but also the toxins that the government said was
[24:53.120 --> 24:54.120]  a lie.
[24:54.120 --> 25:02.160]  There's a whole up article saying I'm a conspiracy theorist from 2002 that the dust is not poisonous.
[25:02.160 --> 25:03.880]  That's not next year's news today, folks.
[25:03.880 --> 25:08.040]  That's 19 years later, 18 years later.
[25:08.040 --> 25:11.120]  And so, hey, great John Stuart, you're the big angel now, huh?
[25:11.120 --> 25:15.360]  Oh, now you're going to get them their money when most of them are already dead.
[25:15.360 --> 25:20.480]  All I'm saying is, buddy, this is a great way for you to look like the hero.
[25:20.480 --> 25:24.760]  But were you there, John Stuart, 18 years ago, like I was, giving speeches at those
[25:24.760 --> 25:29.160]  churches, having my listeners come and not touching the money, and giving 100 percent
[25:29.160 --> 25:33.840]  of the firemen, the police and their families, like I did, and I'm not bragging.
[25:33.840 --> 25:38.840]  I'm just sick and tired of the establishment, talking about how good they are, all the great
[25:38.840 --> 25:44.040]  things they've done, when what they do is they show up later and they take credit for
[25:44.040 --> 25:47.080]  what other people have done.
[25:47.080 --> 25:54.840]  I was physically attacked, the video somewhere, physically attacked in New York repeatedly
[25:54.840 --> 26:02.080]  at ground zero for saying they covered up deadly dust.
[26:02.080 --> 26:04.520]  And it goes on and on and on.
[26:04.520 --> 26:07.040]  We had C-SPAN specials on the dust.
[26:07.040 --> 26:10.280]  We had C-SPAN specials on 9-11, and how there was a stand-down.
[26:10.280 --> 26:12.360]  All of it turned out to be true.
[26:12.360 --> 26:15.840]  That's why M4 Wars is important, because we'll tell you about the collapsed border.
[26:15.840 --> 26:21.600]  People show you the people from Ebola-infested Congo, which, by the way, now has jumped into
[26:21.600 --> 26:25.200]  other countries for the first time ever.
[26:25.200 --> 26:28.440]  It's made it out of the Congo.
[26:28.440 --> 26:29.440]  Associated press.
[26:29.440 --> 26:33.360]  Why do you think it's making it out of the Congo?
[26:33.360 --> 26:37.160]  Because they've put in airfields there, and the people that have money are fleeing, and
[26:37.160 --> 26:41.520]  they're coming here.
[26:41.520 --> 26:45.280]  And the board patrol came out and told you the same thing they told me two days ago.
[26:45.280 --> 26:50.600]  And the Associated Press today saying no one is being screened for Ebola.
[26:50.600 --> 26:52.360]  It's all up on dreadsreport.com.
[26:52.360 --> 26:58.880]  The whole menu of what's happening, U.S. cities overwhelmed with illegals from Ebola countries,
[26:58.880 --> 27:04.240]  not being screened, quarantined, California, desert towns, these migrant surge as crisis
[27:04.240 --> 27:10.640]  worsens, nonstop dumping, new phenomenon, crawling out of manholes in El Paso, Trump,
[27:10.640 --> 27:14.960]  Mexico doing great job at border, really helping us.
[27:14.960 --> 27:19.320]  Get wall, group order to keep gate open for illegals.
[27:19.320 --> 27:21.720]  Watch a thousand pour in.
[27:21.720 --> 27:27.240]  Naked intruder on immigration hold after threatening Dallas couple.
[27:27.240 --> 27:37.960]  And of course, nine out of 10 people that are apprehended never show up to the hearings.
[27:37.960 --> 27:44.920]  And remember, one-third of the children they've been genetically tested are not from the family.
[27:44.920 --> 27:45.920]  They've been grabbed.
[27:45.920 --> 27:48.960]  And when they question the children, they say, no, I was grabbed.
[27:48.960 --> 27:55.880]  A lot of them were grabbed out of backyards and off the road in Mexico because they're
[27:55.880 --> 27:58.240]  the get into America free card.
[27:58.240 --> 28:00.680]  Have you got a kid with you?
[28:00.680 --> 28:02.320]  They don't check your name, nothing.
[28:02.320 --> 28:04.720]  You're just sent to a Democrat facility.
[28:04.720 --> 28:10.520]  Taxpayers load you on a bus and you're shipped to hell knows where.
[28:10.520 --> 28:15.160]  That's paid $130 to rent boy to cross the border.
[28:15.160 --> 28:16.160]  Yeah.
[28:16.160 --> 28:19.640]  Again, as I'm talking, there's search engine and, and, and, and, oh, remember what the media
[28:19.640 --> 28:20.640]  said last year?
[28:20.640 --> 28:21.640]  Oh, there's no caravanser.
[28:21.640 --> 28:23.760]  There's a hundred people in them.
[28:23.760 --> 28:28.960]  One caravan alone was at least 15,000 people.
[28:28.960 --> 28:38.120]  Local law enforcement estimated 15,000 people tearing down gates, storming in.
[28:38.120 --> 28:40.920]  But John Stuart says we're making it all up.
[28:40.920 --> 28:43.920]  You know, if you're to believe Trump, they're coming in from here.
[28:43.920 --> 28:44.920]  They're coming in from there.
[28:44.920 --> 28:45.920]  It's dangerous.
[28:45.920 --> 28:46.920]  Well, of course it is.
[28:46.920 --> 28:52.200]  But you're there to manage this, aren't you, with nice little PR pieces.
[28:52.200 --> 28:56.360]  When you're a thousand days late, a trillion dollars short with Stuart, you're just covering
[28:56.360 --> 28:59.840]  your ass.
[28:59.840 --> 29:01.640]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[29:01.640 --> 29:06.240]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected
[29:06.240 --> 29:08.480]  by you, but the symptoms are there.
[29:08.480 --> 29:13.520]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are
[29:13.520 --> 29:17.080]  just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[29:17.080 --> 29:21.560]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives

[29:24.560 --> 29:26.560]  My diabetes has totally improved.

[32:00.480 --> 32:04.440]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[32:04.440 --> 32:09.080]  So the Infowars model is a self-fulfilling, self-supporting structure that is promoting
[32:09.080 --> 32:14.000]  free press and free speech by people getting together and supporting one another and sustaining
[32:14.000 --> 32:19.600]  one another. It is the only independent press of this size and scale, of this public reach.
[32:19.600 --> 32:24.400]  It is the one model that says, here's a way to have a self-supporting, self-sustaining,
[32:24.400 --> 32:28.640]  self-structured, little de-democratic structure that because the audience determines what
[32:28.640 --> 32:33.000]  content goes up, the audience determines what audience is ultimately reached by their choices
[32:33.000 --> 32:34.000]  in supporting Infowars.
[32:34.000 --> 32:38.640]  And it's all because the audience spends their whatever it is, whether it's $5 or $50
[32:38.640 --> 32:42.800]  a month on products that they like and that they want that actually compete with the corporate-driven
[32:42.800 --> 32:47.720]  model and the ability to do that and at the same time support press, support speech, support
[32:47.720 --> 32:52.040]  letting the audience choose what news they want to see and what views they want to hold.
[32:52.040 --> 32:56.640]  And it's the ultimate American democratic expression and experiment and it is the celebration
[32:56.640 --> 33:03.520]  of free press and free speech with free markets.
[33:03.520 --> 33:25.040]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:25.040 --> 33:30.920]  I'm watching the midterms. Then you would think our country is Mad Max Thunderdome.
[33:30.920 --> 33:38.640]  This guy is like, they're coming from Guatemala, they're coming from Mexico.
[33:38.640 --> 33:40.560]  There's a liberal mob that's coming.
[33:40.560 --> 34:05.400]  You want to drop? You want to drop? Yeah! Who are the president? He's the boy.
[34:05.400 --> 34:30.520]  And you would think everybody in the countries is like to the bunker.
[34:30.520 --> 34:35.720]  The only way Info Wars reaches new people in this critical fight for hearts and minds
[34:35.720 --> 34:40.240]  is you. Whether you're listening on local radio or TV stations, whether you're watching
[34:40.240 --> 34:47.640]  over the Internet live or later in some underground tape or on some thumb drive, this information
[34:47.640 --> 34:51.240]  is evergreen because we're covering the facts.
[34:51.240 --> 34:55.520]  That's why the establishment spends so much time trying to discredit us and lie about us
[34:55.520 --> 35:01.000]  and shut us down because we've got their number and we're winning thanks to you. We're in this
[35:01.000 --> 35:03.000]  together.
[35:03.000 --> 35:11.760]  Let me do this. Every day I come in and it gets harder to do the show because five years
[35:11.760 --> 35:21.440]  ago if I had one story like I have a hundred of, I would be excited and would have trouble
[35:21.440 --> 35:25.240]  containing myself.
[35:25.240 --> 35:33.560]  Watch now, so cuckoo, so out of control. Without looking for it, I have a stack of news with
[35:33.560 --> 35:42.040]  major government figures, major think tanks, major organizations saying it doesn't hurt
[35:42.040 --> 35:49.080]  children for adults to have sex with them, which of course we all know is a lie. And
[35:49.080 --> 35:55.220]  let's legalize child porn. So that means the exploitation of children. I mean this is just
[35:55.220 --> 36:04.920]  evil coming right up out of the pit of hell, folks. Okay? And then you can't turn on television
[36:04.920 --> 36:12.320]  or read a menu of shows without looking at shows about young people, you know, six, seven,
[36:12.320 --> 36:19.200]  eight, nine, 10, up to 16-year-olds having sex. And it's all just conditioning everyone.
[36:19.200 --> 36:26.560]  It's pure evil. HBO's explicit euphoria, courts controversy, how much teen sex and drugs is
[36:26.560 --> 36:35.680]  too much. British think tank proposes not prosecuting pedophiles for viewing child pornography.
[36:35.680 --> 36:47.760]  Quote, we can't prove sex with children doesn't harm them, says labor-linked N-C-L-L, N-C-C-L.
[36:47.760 --> 36:55.760]  That's a major lobbying group. Remember Tom DeLay back in 2015? He warned the Justice
[36:55.760 --> 37:01.720]  Department wants to legalize 12 perversions. He got the document, turns out it's accurate.
[37:01.720 --> 37:09.040]  Remember Hillary Clinton? NBC News, Hillary Clinton covered up pedophile ring at State
[37:09.040 --> 37:17.960]  Department. I mean, the UN got caught kidnapping thousands of children in Haiti alone. Many
[37:17.960 --> 37:23.160]  of them died. Large portions of the children being brought into the U.S. aren't with their
[37:23.160 --> 37:29.080]  parents or any of their real kin. Many of them were being child trafficked. The Senate
[37:29.080 --> 37:34.120]  admits that. And you go out to any of these Democrat events. You can see our videos, Millie
[37:34.120 --> 37:44.160]  Weaver and Katelyn Bennett and others on the street. And you go out there. And what do
[37:44.160 --> 37:54.680]  you see? You see people wearing shirts saying no borders, no wall, no USA at all. There's
[37:54.680 --> 38:03.080]  one right there. Nobody is illegal. And these men march over to Katelyn Bennett at a Buddha
[38:03.080 --> 38:09.400]  judge event. And physically attack her and hit her and slap her and elbow her and the
[38:09.400 --> 38:15.960]  two men she's with, their fiance and her camera guy. And then while they're attacking them,
[38:15.960 --> 38:26.300]  they're saying you're attacking me. I had people in a restaurant say F you and your
[38:26.300 --> 38:32.360]  family Saturday. And then I said screw you back. And they went how dare you shame on
[38:32.360 --> 38:37.240]  you yell at us. And they all smiled at each other. I'm like what because you can murder
[38:37.240 --> 38:45.200]  logic because you're a mental patient. They're all the same. They attack, throw a water bottle
[38:45.200 --> 39:00.100]  in your face, slap a woman's breast until a homeless man, a black homeless man came
[39:00.100 --> 39:11.240]  over and stopped them and said walk it off. Walk it off. One white teenager looks like
[39:11.240 --> 39:18.840]  he's a day of the dead zombie. His potbellied friend, couple good buddies and the black
[39:18.840 --> 39:27.000]  dude stopping them. Unbelievable. You know, that's what this country has come to. And
[39:27.000 --> 39:34.760]  here's the thing. I'm shying away from our top story. In fact, you know, I had it printed.
[39:34.760 --> 39:40.880]  You guys print me the Putin story. I can't find it in my stack. And then I actually want
[39:40.880 --> 39:47.280]  to post that whole RT story on info wars.com in the live show feed page. I forgot to tell
[39:47.280 --> 40:01.160]  Ben or one of the other great writers that Putin came out and said that the end of the
[40:01.160 --> 40:07.600]  world could come very, very soon. So a guy that has 10,000 nuclear weapons warned the
[40:07.600 --> 40:16.560]  end of the world could be here soon and issued a dire warning. The headline on info wars.com
[40:16.560 --> 40:19.520]  with the live feed where I'm going to add the article. We're going to play the video
[40:19.520 --> 40:28.040]  next segment. Maximum alert. Putin issues dire warning. Plus US border completely collapses.
[40:28.040 --> 40:36.000]  And that is what's happened. And Mexico has gone in just one month from helping organize
[40:36.000 --> 40:41.240]  the collapse of the border, letting people transit through Mexico for paying thousands
[40:41.240 --> 40:49.040]  of dollars a piece. It comes right from Soros, taxpayer money through the UN State Department
[40:49.040 --> 40:54.440]  to now put the National Guard down there and deporting people and charging a whole bunch
[40:54.440 --> 40:58.160]  of the smugglers. Well, you should have been charging them to begin with because you know
[40:58.160 --> 41:07.040]  what the Mexicans are finding out about. People are grabbing their kids. And almost none
[41:07.040 --> 41:15.280]  of these people are Mexican. And Mexicans, if they're anything, are territorial and
[41:15.280 --> 41:19.840]  pro family and they understand when people are walking all over them. So the little
[41:19.840 --> 41:26.400]  socialist president has had a major Mexican backlash to Central and South America and
[41:26.400 --> 41:33.920]  Africa and Asia using it as a doormat with the cartels Senate reports show making over
[41:33.920 --> 41:39.960]  $2 billion in the last year. It was a billion and something the year before. In fact, there's
[41:39.960 --> 41:46.560]  a Lindsey Graham video report on that we're going to get to. But we also have limbo with
[41:46.560 --> 41:53.960]  that fantastic idea. And I've said this. I'm sorry. I've said this for two years that President
[41:53.960 --> 42:02.360]  Trump should campaign more in California that he should go to Skid Row that he should go
[42:02.360 --> 42:06.720]  tour these 10 cities like I and others have done. When we went there, we said Trump needs
[42:06.720 --> 42:13.960]  to do this and limbo says absolutely he needs to tour Seattle. He needs to tour Portland.
[42:13.960 --> 42:24.040]  He needs to tour all of these places and go there with a phalanx of police around him
[42:24.040 --> 42:30.080]  and let the world see what I and others have seen because we say you think you've seen
[42:30.080 --> 42:38.280]  something on the news. They're not showing you anything. I've never imagined anything
[42:38.280 --> 42:48.680]  like this. Imagine concentration camp victim style people covered in semen and flies and
[42:48.680 --> 42:55.960]  trash and stitch the smell of vision and the piles of feces stretching as far as the eye
[42:55.960 --> 43:03.320]  can see. The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment
[43:03.320 --> 43:08.560]  full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it, that it lowers IQ. It
[43:08.560 --> 43:13.640]  literally dumps the population down. And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers
[43:13.640 --> 43:20.000]  the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations. First, seaweed based iodine
[43:20.000 --> 43:23.320]  that was pretty good but hard to source and the globalists tried to block us getting a
[43:23.320 --> 43:29.240]  supply of it so we discovered deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2
[43:29.240 --> 43:34.080]  that's been incredible. Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research
[43:34.080 --> 43:39.640]  and secured more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine. But chemists, scientists
[43:39.640 --> 43:43.880]  and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two
[43:43.880 --> 43:51.920]  forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable. Ladies
[43:51.920 --> 43:56.080]  and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[43:56.080 --> 44:02.120]  X3, now available at M4WarsLive.com. It's time. It's time to start your summer with

[44:59.200 --> 45:06.960]  Stacy in the great state of Texas. In FEMA Region 6, you're on the air worldwide, Stacy.
[45:06.960 --> 45:10.840]  Good to talk to you. Before I get into what I want to say, I just want to let you know
[45:10.840 --> 45:14.760]  that I don't normally take vitamins at all. I was turned on to the ultimate female force.
[45:14.760 --> 45:19.160]  I looked at all the ingredients and they're all organic, root, things like that that I
[45:19.160 --> 45:22.840]  trust. You know, because I've seen a lot of other vitamins. They don't have things that
[45:22.840 --> 45:26.160]  they say that they have in them. And they're often not things that are natural. I appreciate
[45:26.160 --> 45:29.040]  that. Well, what happened with ultimate female force? Tell us about it. Well, it's really
[45:29.040 --> 45:32.400]  great. You know, it's like a multivitamin. I take it. It tastes good. It doesn't have
[45:32.400 --> 45:36.240]  that nasty aftertaste. It actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste. And you know, it
[45:36.240 --> 45:39.640]  just gives me energy and fuels me throughout the day. So I really like it. Well, just
[45:39.640 --> 45:43.960]  you know, we look at whatever the best herbs are, they're known to turbo charge women and
[45:43.960 --> 45:49.400]  then we get the organic ones and put it in it. So yeah, stamina, libido, energy, these
[45:49.400 --> 45:54.880]  are amazing things and ultimate female force. So I'm glad you plugged it in for store.com
[45:54.880 --> 46:02.320]  or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine. The globalists are hyper competitive
[46:02.320 --> 46:07.240]  scientific dictators. They are technocrats. They are control freaks in their own words
[46:07.240 --> 46:10.720]  and they believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own decisions gets
[46:10.720 --> 46:15.400]  to the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods. Now we're fighting them hard
[46:15.400 --> 46:19.320]  in cyberspace. We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension. But one of the
[46:19.320 --> 46:23.320]  biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in
[46:23.320 --> 46:28.280]  our lives is our bodies. If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements for the forest
[46:28.280 --> 46:34.080]  life.com, I couldn't do it. That's why we decided to take our original secret 12 that
[46:34.080 --> 46:40.840]  was incredibly high quality. And double the strength of it in a new formula, ultra 12 ultra

[46:45.760 --> 46:51.080]  find anywhere. It is amazing experience pure medical bottom and B 12 for yourself and fund
[46:51.080 --> 46:57.320]  the second American Revolution against the tyrants at info wars store.com in force life.com
[46:57.320 --> 47:02.960]  or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[47:02.960 --> 47:22.600]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World
[47:22.600 --> 47:33.680]  Order. It's Alex Jones. So Trump's actually fighting for the very survival of this country's
[47:33.680 --> 47:41.760]  existence. Back about 15 years ago, when Lou Dobbs was number one on CNN for about five
[47:41.760 --> 47:48.920]  years, number one, actually anywhere on cable, had upwards of seven million viewers a night.
[47:48.920 --> 47:55.280]  He would have documents on the show routinely. And they had the Trans Pacific partnership
[47:55.280 --> 48:01.280]  precursor documents. They had the North American Union documents. It was big news. And in there,
[48:01.280 --> 48:06.040]  they said, we're going to bring in the one world government and break the country into
[48:06.040 --> 48:15.000]  three mega regions with 10 sub regions. Where have I heard of that before 2000 years ago?
[48:15.000 --> 48:19.680]  That's what his prophecy says. And we're going to get rid of nations by having crises so
[48:19.680 --> 48:25.640]  big only world government can handle it. And we're going to have a North American security
[48:25.640 --> 48:34.080]  perimeter that is going to be formed by collapsing third world populations and migration. That's
[48:34.080 --> 48:44.280]  number one. Number two, infectious disease outbreaks that cross borders. And number three,
[48:44.280 --> 48:52.480]  economic issues. Economic collapse. So you've got the threat of crime and the threat of
[48:52.480 --> 49:00.680]  giant masses pouring across. You've got the threat of disease. You've got economic threat.
[49:00.680 --> 49:05.440]  And the UN admits they're going to bring in world government because the UN controls
[49:05.440 --> 49:09.520]  all these third world countries. There's only a few they don't control. They're always
[49:09.520 --> 49:15.120]  busy overthrowing. They're the corporate world government. And they overthrow your country
[49:15.120 --> 49:19.640]  and they'll put an even worse dictator in. And then they set up the airfields and the
[49:19.640 --> 49:26.920]  funding. But because Trump controls ICE and they won't automatically just let you in,
[49:26.920 --> 49:33.920]  they fly you to Guatemala. And then you're given money. And you come up here and they're
[49:33.920 --> 49:40.440]  opening up the corridors. And even local San Antonio news said, it's wonderful. The new
[49:40.440 --> 49:45.560]  Congo culture and this family from the Congo, they just got here a year ago. They're going
[49:45.560 --> 49:51.820]  to make meals for everyone from the Congo. So they feel good. And we're going to rough
[49:51.820 --> 49:59.200]  up the info wars reporter to, you know, we're not going to let them videotape us out here.
[49:59.200 --> 50:05.680]  Because we, we deboss us. Now, no other countries let you do this. And these people are brought
[50:05.680 --> 50:11.560]  into refugee centers for a few months. This is on record. Before they're brought here
[50:11.560 --> 50:16.680]  and they're brainwashed to hate America. And to be told that the everyone that doesn't
[50:16.680 --> 50:21.720]  want them here is a racist and bad, just like when kids go to college, they tell them, Hey,
[50:21.720 --> 50:28.760]  the KKK is on campus. This is a formula. You better come to this particular dorm area.
[50:28.760 --> 50:34.800]  You're going to make sure you're safe. And then they enroll you always the most needy,
[50:34.800 --> 50:41.640]  autistic style, Asperger spectrum type people. This is all admitted. They go and they get
[50:41.640 --> 50:49.560]  the fluoride damage, the vaccine damage, the scared, the nerdly, and then they indoctrinate
[50:49.560 --> 50:54.840]  them into their cult. That's why you go to a leftist parade or a leftist event. I don't
[50:54.840 --> 51:01.080]  care if it's a gay pride rally. I don't care if it's just a leftist rally for Joe Biden.
[51:01.080 --> 51:12.440]  The people look mentally retarded. They look completely lost. They can hardly talk. They're
[51:12.440 --> 51:22.160]  drugged out of their minds. And what is in the news? They admit highest suicide rates
[51:22.160 --> 51:29.040]  in leftist highest mental illness, highest drug level, highest crime level, highest disease
[51:29.040 --> 51:39.920]  level. Because these folks are one step away from the giant zombie hordes that are now
[51:39.920 --> 51:45.920]  all over the Western world of people that don't and won't work, who just sit around
[51:45.920 --> 51:53.360]  mainlining heroin is so cheap like $3 a dose and smoke and crack and laying around in their
[51:53.360 --> 52:00.240]  own feces because we all bow down to it and don't demand and expect more. It's called
[52:00.240 --> 52:09.160]  decadence. It's called what happens before civilizations collapse. When you go to the
[52:09.160 --> 52:14.520]  gay pride parade, like our reporters have been doing, people come up and they say, f straights,
[52:14.520 --> 52:20.080]  you've never been abused. You never know what it's like to be us poor victims. And people
[52:20.080 --> 52:24.560]  aren't even hating on these folks because of what they're doing with their dingleings.
[52:24.560 --> 52:32.520]  It's because of all the anti-gun, anti-family rhetoric and the trying to recruit children
[52:32.520 --> 52:36.640]  and the trying to take over the educational system and the demanding crosses be taken
[52:36.640 --> 52:44.040]  down. And I've got stacks of articles here where lesbians particularly are cutting the
[52:44.040 --> 52:52.840]  genitals off at alarming rates of little boys they adopt and then stabbing them to death.
[52:52.840 --> 52:59.080]  That's up on infowars.com and newswars.com today, natural news and an excellent article
[52:59.080 --> 53:04.400]  on it. I dare you to go read it and the crime statistics. Now is that saying every woman
[53:04.400 --> 53:09.360]  likes women is cutting little boys' penises off? No, ladies and gentlemen, it's a fact
[53:09.360 --> 53:14.840]  statistically that you've got more family violence, more suicide, more abuse. How abusive
[53:14.840 --> 53:20.000]  is it these families that tell their three-year-old son you're really a girl or tell their little
[53:20.000 --> 53:24.560]  girl you're really a boy and push that on? That's the greatest form of abuse being done
[53:24.560 --> 53:30.440]  as if, oh, our kid will be part of the pool club because that's really what this is. It's
[53:30.440 --> 53:37.600]  like a street game. And in some of these videos we're going to play today, they tell Millie
[53:37.600 --> 53:45.040]  Weaver at the gay pride parades where it's rainbows and the word gay and everything's
[53:45.040 --> 53:52.080]  happy. Kind of like the light on the end of a anglerfish's head, you know, getting the
[53:52.080 --> 53:57.520]  menos to swim up. What's at the bottom of that isn't too pretty. Leftist indoctrination
[53:57.520 --> 54:03.800]  collapse of society. And it's not just the quote, gays. It's corruption of every type,
[54:03.800 --> 54:10.360]  decadence of every type, heterosexual decadence. You name it, it's all just decadence. And
[54:10.360 --> 54:18.080]  the hatred of people that are trying to hold it all together. That's what this is. And
[54:18.080 --> 54:23.080]  they say over and over again in the videos, this is our religion. And that's really what
[54:23.080 --> 54:31.240]  it is. You see, we got rid of Christianity and we got rid of all of the old norms. And
[54:31.240 --> 54:35.080]  there were probably some problems in those old norms, but it's been the West that's
[54:35.080 --> 54:45.120]  been the most open. But we've traded out some of the extreme conservatism of the 20s, 30s,
[54:45.120 --> 54:52.400]  40s, 50s for new forms of bondage, new forms of oppression. And no one can deny it. Meet
[54:52.400 --> 54:58.120]  the new boss, same as the old boss. And why do you think people used to try to outlaw
[54:58.120 --> 55:02.920]  all this type of decadence stuff? Or why do people look down on women having children
[55:02.920 --> 55:08.480]  outside wedlock? And why do people look down on when men start having sex with each other
[55:08.480 --> 55:13.720]  and then start acting like women and then start flaunting it? People figure it out. Every
[55:13.720 --> 55:19.960]  time you do that, society collapses. That's why the Chinese have outlawed it for 4,000
[55:19.960 --> 55:25.440]  years. That's why the Japanese have outlawed it. That's why every culture outlawed it because
[55:25.440 --> 55:31.760]  as soon as the Greeks started doing it, collapse. As soon as the Romans started doing it, collapse.
[55:31.760 --> 55:41.940]  We've been down this road before. The Romans, when they were coming up in the Stoic period
[55:41.940 --> 55:49.000]  before the Golden Age, would execute you for adultery. It was seen as the same as
[55:49.000 --> 55:54.840]  two men having sex. Hey, buddy, men, women are the species. Whether you call yourself
[55:54.840 --> 56:00.920]  gay, straight, whatever it is, I'm a libertarian and don't hate you for who you are. My God.
[56:00.920 --> 56:09.120]  The point is, is you can study this scientifically and know that when we go down this path historically,
[56:09.120 --> 56:14.440]  the bottom always drops out and society collapses. And next, they always come for the kids and
[56:14.440 --> 56:20.840]  now they are. Read the Old Testament. And armies would come in and say, we're here to
[56:20.840 --> 56:28.080]  have sex with your kids. Armies of men dressed up like women. It's in the Bible. It's in
[56:28.080 --> 56:34.440]  historical reports. When men start dressing up like women, buddy, they're coming for,
[56:34.440 --> 56:41.080]  you know what? Now, can you figure out why? Whatever, it happens everywhere. It goes in
[56:41.080 --> 56:47.440]  cycles. And did you know the head of the Amber Alert system nationally was convicted for
[56:47.440 --> 56:51.160]  child smuggling? Bet you didn't know that. We're going to cover that next hour. I said
[56:51.160 --> 56:54.520]  I'd get to the Putin thing and I will, but it's so huge that I'm going to save it till
[56:54.520 --> 56:59.920]  the start of the second segment next hour, threatening nuclear war, threatening the world
[56:59.920 --> 57:03.640]  could end just unprecedented in any way you slice it. One of the biggest things we've
[57:03.640 --> 57:08.680]  ever reported on that's next hour. Please, whatever you do, realize the way we get past
[57:08.680 --> 57:13.840]  the censors is you spread the word, you emailing the links, you spreading the articles on your
[57:13.840 --> 57:21.040]  email. However, word of mouth text messages is whatever you do, we're raising the alarm.
[57:21.040 --> 57:24.920]  The only way folks are going to see all this dramatic footage and see all the incredible
[57:24.920 --> 57:28.280]  things that are happening that big brother hopes you don't see is breaking that news
[57:28.280 --> 57:33.120]  blockade and only we can do that together. And we are breaking the blockade, but all
[57:33.120 --> 57:37.400]  the foreign invasion, all the disease pouring and all of the craziness, all the left and
[57:37.400 --> 57:43.560]  right it's happening is at info wars.com and news wars.com. And we've got the big specials
[57:43.560 --> 57:53.560]  on all of our top selling supplements like turbo force and DNA force. Okay, it's true.
[57:53.560 --> 58:08.560]  Okay, so I had half the turbo force this morning, the vitamins, the minerals, the amino acids,
[58:08.560 --> 58:19.560]  the vitamins, the minerals, the amino acids, the vitamins, the minerals, the amino acids,
[58:19.560 --> 58:45.920]  the vitamins, Din. And get the fish oil.
[58:49.560 --> 58:53.560]  InfoWarsLife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[58:53.560 --> 58:55.560]  Introducing pollen block.
[58:55.560 --> 59:00.560]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[59:00.560 --> 59:07.560]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory function.
[59:07.560 --> 59:12.560]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs
[59:12.560 --> 59:16.560]  experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[59:16.560 --> 59:20.560]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later,
[59:20.560 --> 59:27.560]  we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[59:27.560 --> 59:31.560]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine.
[59:31.560 --> 59:36.560]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase,
[59:36.560 --> 59:41.560]  which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[59:41.560 --> 59:44.560]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[59:44.560 --> 59:49.560]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[1:00:15.560 --> 1:00:20.560]  So, I'll tell you, I'm not as pretty as I used to be.
[1:00:20.560 --> 1:00:28.560]  I'm kind of a little fuggly, funny-looking and ugly.
[1:00:28.560 --> 1:00:33.560]  But whatever they're drinking and eating in the left, I don't want to be part of it.
[1:00:33.560 --> 1:00:38.560]  And you go to any Lepus event, they look like they've been shot with a mutation ray
[1:00:38.560 --> 1:00:42.560]  and beaten with an ugly stick, and then you talk to them.
[1:00:42.560 --> 1:00:46.560]  They all sound like Joe Biden and they have a bunch of marbles in their mouth.
[1:00:46.560 --> 1:00:53.560]  And I don't say that to be mean, but all the studies show conservatives live longer.
[1:00:53.560 --> 1:00:58.560]  Conservatives are happier. Conservatives make more money.
[1:00:58.560 --> 1:01:05.560]  Conservatives give more to charity. Conservatives are way less likely to steal.
[1:01:05.560 --> 1:01:13.560]  There's all the studies, even the liberal Atlantic, why conservatives find life more meaningful than liberals.
[1:01:13.560 --> 1:01:18.560]  Well, because they value what's proven. They value what works.
[1:01:18.560 --> 1:01:23.560]  They value what's steadfast. They value what's strong.
[1:01:23.560 --> 1:01:27.560]  And it doesn't mean that they're perfect.
[1:01:27.560 --> 1:01:32.560]  It doesn't mean that most conservatives even judge other people.
[1:01:32.560 --> 1:01:38.560]  But when you try to judge them and tell them who they are and tell them how to think
[1:01:38.560 --> 1:01:45.560]  and tell them how to behave, it is very, very saddening.
[1:01:45.560 --> 1:01:51.560]  I am hurt by...
[1:01:51.560 --> 1:01:56.560]  These are apparently good-looking liberals. Some of the footage, though, on these tapes,
[1:01:56.560 --> 1:02:04.560]  I mean, these people look like they were radiated or something. I mean, they've got serious chromosomal issues,
[1:02:04.560 --> 1:02:10.560]  not extra or less chromosomes, more of a scrambling and doubling.
[1:02:10.560 --> 1:02:17.560]  There's a lot of stuff going on here. And it's not good.
[1:02:17.560 --> 1:02:25.560]  But the worst part about it is how they bark the same mindless, bleeping, bleeding things.
[1:02:25.560 --> 1:02:28.560]  I will do it at the bottom of the hour.
[1:02:28.560 --> 1:02:35.560]  I'm going to play Millie Weaver's visit to a gay pride parade.
[1:02:35.560 --> 1:02:44.560]  And when you hear the people, a lot of them don't think there should be a straight pride parade allowed.
[1:02:44.560 --> 1:02:48.560]  And see, that's really why I don't like you.
[1:02:48.560 --> 1:02:53.560]  It's not because you're wearing rainbows and out because you're ugly.
[1:02:53.560 --> 1:03:04.560]  And I just said I'm ugly, too. The point is, it doesn't mean I like looking in the mirror.
[1:03:04.560 --> 1:03:09.560]  It's just, as a group, you're falling apart.
[1:03:09.560 --> 1:03:19.560]  And you've got all these leftists all over, even in England, wearing shirts saying,
[1:03:19.560 --> 1:03:26.560]  F, you're straight pride. So see, that's what this is, is that straight people are under attack.
[1:03:26.560 --> 1:03:30.560]  White men are under attack. All the statistics show the family's falling apart.
[1:03:30.560 --> 1:03:34.560]  Men are under attack, period. Fathers are under attack.
[1:03:34.560 --> 1:03:37.560]  Something like 70% of college graduates are women.
[1:03:37.560 --> 1:03:43.560]  And the idea is, oh, the world will be better when the women don't have husbands and there's not more people
[1:03:43.560 --> 1:03:46.560]  or kids are raised by the state. Okay, whatever.
[1:03:46.560 --> 1:03:52.560]  I look at universities I go on and things don't look too good.
[1:03:52.560 --> 1:04:00.560]  I mean, back when I was in college, 25 years ago, 26 years ago, 27 years ago, people were a lot better looking.
[1:04:00.560 --> 1:04:04.560]  I don't care what color they were. Something's wrong, folks.
[1:04:04.560 --> 1:04:09.560]  And people don't have that light in their eyes anymore. It's scary.
[1:04:09.560 --> 1:04:13.560]  But when I go to a conservative or a Christian or a nationalist event,
[1:04:13.560 --> 1:04:17.560]  you know, I went to church a few months ago and invited me, Jesse James, to a big megachurch.
[1:04:17.560 --> 1:04:23.560]  It was a nice church. And I was just looking at the people, black people, brown people, white people.
[1:04:23.560 --> 1:04:26.560]  And I was like, these people all look good, man.
[1:04:26.560 --> 1:04:32.560]  I was like, you know, I'm like kind of, well, the bottom third here is a good-looking crowd.
[1:04:32.560 --> 1:04:34.560]  I was in a couple thousand really good-looking people.
[1:04:34.560 --> 1:04:39.560]  Like, what is it about Jesus? The people that look good?
[1:04:39.560 --> 1:04:45.560]  Well, it's because the spirit they're animated with. You could animate one of these ugly people and they wouldn't be so ugly.
[1:04:45.560 --> 1:04:49.560]  It's like a woman that isn't that classically beautiful.
[1:04:49.560 --> 1:04:52.560]  Please don't do that again. Lock this monster.
[1:04:52.560 --> 1:04:57.560]  But she's got that spirit and she'll see sexier than the Barbie doll.
[1:05:04.560 --> 1:05:08.560]  We have a new super special. It's on everything with force in its name.
[1:05:08.560 --> 1:05:14.560]  The new, already best-selling space force, America's back, awesome shirt that I love and everybody else is loving.
[1:05:14.560 --> 1:05:18.560]  It's gonna be a hit shirt now. Hope you get it. Sports broadcast spreads the word. It's a great conversation.

[1:05:21.560 --> 1:05:27.560]  All the other force products, it's all 50% off DNA Force Plus. That is such a huge deal.

[1:05:49.560 --> 1:05:51.560]  infowarstore.com.
[1:05:52.560 --> 1:05:57.560]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[1:05:58.560 --> 1:06:02.560]  I'm standing in this briefing room right now. There is no government official here.
[1:06:02.560 --> 1:06:07.560]  But I'll say that the press is not the enemy of the people.
[1:06:18.560 --> 1:06:21.560]  But I'll say that the press is not the enemy of the people.
[1:06:21.560 --> 1:06:24.560]  The press is not the enemy of the people.
[1:06:24.560 --> 1:06:27.560]  The press is not the enemy of the people.
[1:06:27.560 --> 1:06:29.560]  They came in peace
[1:06:47.720 --> 1:06:52.580]  Maybe we should go out on Pennsylvania Avenue like these folks who chant CNN sucks and
[1:06:52.580 --> 1:06:58.660]  Fake news, maybe we should go out all all journalists should go out on Pennsylvania Avenue and chant
[1:06:58.660 --> 1:07:00.660]  We're not the enemy of the people
[1:07:00.660 --> 1:07:15.460]  We're not the enemy of the people we're not the enemy of the people we're not the enemy of the people
[1:07:15.460 --> 1:07:24.580]  This is CNN
[1:07:34.580 --> 1:07:40.860]  Live from Austin, Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones
[1:07:40.860 --> 1:07:48.380]  Well, every generation faces a new threat a new war and 21st century warfare is off-shore
[1:07:49.780 --> 1:07:56.940]  Megacorporations working to overthrow nations internal strengths their families their cultures and
[1:07:57.860 --> 1:07:59.860]  Selling them in on a modern neoliberal
[1:08:01.980 --> 1:08:03.860]  Corporate leftist
[1:08:03.860 --> 1:08:10.060]  System that exploits the third world and then does reverse colonization and exploits the first world
[1:08:10.060 --> 1:08:13.540]  Populations and then the big mega banks and the ultra rich
[1:08:16.540 --> 1:08:19.180]  Are exempt from the very taxes they foist upon us
[1:08:19.940 --> 1:08:21.660]  Vladimir Putin
[1:08:21.660 --> 1:08:24.900]  Has come out and the full report is on info wars.com
[1:08:26.260 --> 1:08:30.580]  At an international summit yesterday, and it's got almost no attention
[1:08:31.860 --> 1:08:34.420]  RT didn't even think it was worth an article. It was just a video
[1:08:34.420 --> 1:08:41.340]  Putin's dire warning anybody listening and he said nuclear weapons are proliferating
[1:08:41.340 --> 1:08:45.500]  We're getting out of our treaties. The US is getting out of their treaties. They're moving missiles up to our border
[1:08:46.860 --> 1:08:53.100]  This can cause nuclear war. This can cause the destruction of civilization and society
[1:08:56.900 --> 1:09:02.340]  And and imagine if Trump said this could be the end of the world we could kill ourselves
[1:09:02.340 --> 1:09:04.340]  That'd be all over the news
[1:09:04.340 --> 1:09:10.300]  Well, this deserves to be all over the news again. He was in st. Petersburg international economic forum
[1:09:10.300 --> 1:09:16.260]  And he's up there talking about the end of the world nuclear war and how we're closer to it than ever and
[1:09:16.980 --> 1:09:24.340]  It's not on our news and even the Russians are hardly reporting it and you know, I get why they aren't this is scary folks
[1:09:24.380 --> 1:09:26.380]  But you know what Vladimir Putin's right?
[1:09:27.060 --> 1:09:31.060]  We've got more nuclear weapons than we've ever had work countries have them
[1:09:31.060 --> 1:09:35.060]  India and Pakistan have been inches away from nuking each other
[1:09:39.100 --> 1:09:42.820]  And you've got Hollywood because Russia is having a Christian re-assurgence
[1:09:43.740 --> 1:09:50.500]  Because the operating system of the left is anti-Christian anti-family anti-god anti-western culture period
[1:09:52.780 --> 1:09:54.780]  That's their operating system
[1:09:55.100 --> 1:09:58.940]  Because they want to capture it and conquer it and then Putin
[1:09:58.940 --> 1:10:06.180]  Starts getting away from the globalists and so the West is trying to start all these wars with him and what one of Trump's biggest
[1:10:06.180 --> 1:10:07.660]  Failures and he's done a lot of good things
[1:10:07.660 --> 1:10:14.140]  But one of his biggest failures is letting the neocons and the Democrats run the hoax that he got in office because of the Russians
[1:10:14.620 --> 1:10:17.300]  And then he certainly works for the Russians and so
[1:10:17.980 --> 1:10:21.340]  Trump has escalated bad tensions with Russia. I
[1:10:23.340 --> 1:10:26.380]  Don't get a red cent from the Russians never been to Russia
[1:10:26.380 --> 1:10:34.660]  But we'd be stupid to start a fight with a non-expansionist country that's four times our geography has more resources than us
[1:10:36.220 --> 1:10:39.460]  Geographically is in the key area to control the Grand Chess Board
[1:10:41.100 --> 1:10:46.460]  Geopolitically that Zemite Brzezinski talked about the American Russian Alliance
[1:10:47.700 --> 1:10:53.300]  Would be the dominant Alliance into the future to stabilize the planet
[1:10:53.300 --> 1:11:00.660]  To cut off the chai comms ambitions and to secure real global peace into the future, but
[1:11:01.820 --> 1:11:04.940]  That's why the neocons the globalists are not going to allow it
[1:11:06.380 --> 1:11:10.180]  And so yeah, Trump sees it as a victory that he's been proven that he's not a Russian agent
[1:11:12.660 --> 1:11:16.740]  When the globalists have won that round because they've paralyzed Trump
[1:11:17.740 --> 1:11:22.420]  To go with his natural inclination and instinct. It's the same thing with North Korea
[1:11:22.420 --> 1:11:28.180]  Trump knows that South Korea is the most productive country in the world per
[1:11:28.940 --> 1:11:30.940]  Hector
[1:11:31.860 --> 1:11:33.860]  Translated up to a acre
[1:11:34.380 --> 1:11:38.060]  And he's looking at the same genetic same people
[1:11:40.060 --> 1:11:46.140]  Same resources, but bordering China even better position portrayed
[1:11:47.940 --> 1:11:49.940]  Bordering Russia
[1:11:49.940 --> 1:11:58.100]  North Korea what borders like four countries North Korea is prime positioned for economic explosion and
[1:11:59.140 --> 1:12:00.660]  Trump's
[1:12:00.660 --> 1:12:02.340]  salivating
[1:12:02.340 --> 1:12:06.540]  Because he likes expansion human expansionism. That's what we normally do
[1:12:07.980 --> 1:12:09.980]  But we've been taught that's bad that's evil
[1:12:10.700 --> 1:12:16.100]  Because the globalists don't want you to expand they want to expand while you contract has nothing to do with the environment
[1:12:16.100 --> 1:12:18.100]  It's about an anti-human future
[1:12:18.100 --> 1:12:19.620]  And
[1:12:19.620 --> 1:12:21.620]  so Trump's
[1:12:21.620 --> 1:12:22.820]  salivating
[1:12:22.820 --> 1:12:27.180]  To get into Russia not with oligarchs that make one-sided deals and screw the Russians
[1:12:27.460 --> 1:12:32.220]  Trump wants a service economy on top of the raw goods economy
[1:12:36.300 --> 1:12:38.300]  Trump's like
[1:12:39.220 --> 1:12:42.340]  It's twice the size of Africa why are we not there
[1:12:42.340 --> 1:12:47.060]  The Russians are waiting
[1:12:48.220 --> 1:12:50.220]  Waiting wanting
[1:12:50.780 --> 1:12:54.660]  No, we can't have that instead the chai comms won't let us in
[1:12:55.300 --> 1:13:03.020]  Control every company we move over there have 98% of earth men roles are spying on everything or jacking our elections own Hollywood now
[1:13:03.060 --> 1:13:06.780]  They own it. That's I told you that 12 years ago. That's mainline news now
[1:13:06.780 --> 1:13:12.180]  People thought it was crazy when I first said that it's like 15 years ago now
[1:13:12.180 --> 1:13:18.580]  But I'd be in Hollywood with some big production meetings and you know people, you know, you know mark humans calling in you're talking about making films
[1:13:19.100 --> 1:13:21.100]  And I'm like so who really runs Hollywood?
[1:13:22.820 --> 1:13:27.580]  People are like I'm sitting there were like Jewish lawyers. They're like well the Chinese are buying it all up
[1:13:30.140 --> 1:13:33.140]  And I go on air and say that you guys crazy
[1:13:33.140 --> 1:13:43.500]  Meanwhile, even the Washington Post admits China basically controls what Hollywood does they own a controlling interest in six of the big six
[1:13:45.020 --> 1:13:48.420]  Production houses. That's a fact ladies and gentlemen
[1:13:49.700 --> 1:13:51.380]  and
[1:13:51.380 --> 1:13:56.500]  Hollywood has sold out to the chai comms and the left has sold out to the chai comms
[1:13:56.500 --> 1:14:04.300]  Because it's a disgusting anti-christian godless system that met something even more evil than it
[1:14:05.100 --> 1:14:07.260]  Hollywood is China's whore
[1:14:09.820 --> 1:14:11.180]  And
[1:14:11.180 --> 1:14:13.180]  through it China finances
[1:14:14.180 --> 1:14:15.100]  demoralization
[1:14:15.100 --> 1:14:18.420]  That's that's declassified when you turn on Netflix and it
[1:14:19.300 --> 1:14:23.500]  They want to race war or they want to teach you that five-year-olds ought to have sex with men
[1:14:23.500 --> 1:14:29.900]  That's the Chinese coming up with the most evil crap they can and in Hollywood's like we love hurting America
[1:14:31.300 --> 1:14:33.300]  China's like hit them with it
[1:14:33.420 --> 1:14:35.420]  That's a fact
[1:14:35.500 --> 1:14:42.140]  When you turn on Netflix or HBO or CNN for that matter, you're looking at chai-com venom just
[1:14:44.180 --> 1:14:49.740]  Now it's leftist hate of America, but the chai comms pay for it by the thousand gallon drums
[1:14:49.740 --> 1:14:51.740]  The
[1:14:52.660 --> 1:14:54.660]  Poison is leftist
[1:14:54.820 --> 1:14:56.820]  Americana pedophile devil worshiper
[1:14:57.020 --> 1:15:04.020]  But China's funding and mass producing it in big giant vats to shoot into your children's brains
[1:15:08.020 --> 1:15:11.740]  That's why almost all Hollywood productions that China funds are
[1:15:13.260 --> 1:15:16.700]  Illegal in China look it up. Let's say that again
[1:15:16.700 --> 1:15:21.420]  90 plus percent of Hollywood productions
[1:15:25.380 --> 1:15:32.620]  Are illegal in China even though almost all of them are produced with red Chinese money
[1:15:33.260 --> 1:15:39.180]  They wouldn't show their kids that for all the tea in China and let me tell you else what they wouldn't do
[1:15:39.180 --> 1:15:47.500]  Remember Steve Jobs remember Bill Gates. I played the clips both of them won't let their children have iPads or cell phones
[1:15:49.140 --> 1:15:55.460]  But they'll sure give me your kids won't they you just take your baby and throw it right into that pit of snakes

[1:19:05.100 --> 1:19:14.500]  This is a digital AI enforced bag order not to say the name Alex Jones our info wars calm
[1:19:19.500 --> 1:19:27.540]  This is Nazi Germany level this is racketeering this is cartels mr. President. We need your help. We need it now
[1:19:27.780 --> 1:19:32.420]  You can take on big tech. They saw info wars as a dominant independent
[1:19:32.420 --> 1:19:36.820]  Anti-war pro-human pro-sovereign pro-family
[1:19:37.220 --> 1:19:40.980]  Populous organization, so they thought first they come for Alex Jones
[1:19:41.500 --> 1:19:44.260]  Then when people say okay take him off the air
[1:19:44.900 --> 1:19:50.980]  Everyone else like dominoes would fall the way to fight back is to support info wars now more than ever and make it a
[1:19:51.340 --> 1:19:57.020]  Standard of freedom and free speech understand that they believe they can take us down. They'll take everybody else down
[1:19:57.020 --> 1:20:03.820]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:20:27.980 --> 1:20:33.300]  All right, so I've talked about the Putin video it's posted in full at info wars calm
[1:20:34.540 --> 1:20:36.460]  There's links to the whole
[1:20:36.460 --> 1:20:38.460]  security conference yesterday, but again
[1:20:39.260 --> 1:20:41.980]  Putin warns of the end of the world nuclear war
[1:20:43.700 --> 1:20:46.820]  And it's not even in us news and
[1:20:47.420 --> 1:20:52.500]  When they've had a lot of national stories against info wars and I only raised this illustrate how crazy it is and they'll say
[1:20:52.500 --> 1:20:59.900]  An analysis by media matters shows that Jones linked to RT over a thousand times
[1:21:01.580 --> 1:21:03.580]  Yeah, and I linked to
[1:21:04.300 --> 1:21:06.300]  Washington Post more than a thousand times
[1:21:06.860 --> 1:21:08.860]  But again, it's this mental illness
[1:21:09.300 --> 1:21:13.420]  They're trying to induce on to everybody that you're not supposed to listen to what the Russians say
[1:21:13.980 --> 1:21:19.300]  Just listen to what CNN says, you know, I'm gonna listen to the Iranians doesn't mean I agree with them
[1:21:19.300 --> 1:21:23.660]  I'm gonna listen to the Israelis doesn't mean I'm gonna agree with a lot of what the Israelis say sometimes
[1:21:24.340 --> 1:21:32.820]  There's a thousand different ideas over there. Same thing with the US media this idea that oh, did you see he's the guy playing eclipse of Putin?
[1:21:35.100 --> 1:21:41.180]  Yeah, yeah, he's got 10,000 nuclear weapons. Yeah, you bet I'd listen to what he says
[1:21:42.860 --> 1:21:44.860]  That's what Trump says too
[1:21:44.860 --> 1:21:47.700]  Because he's got more than 10,000 nuclear weapons. I
[1:21:49.700 --> 1:21:55.660]  Listen what Obama was saying when he was in there fun in the Arab Spring turning Islam loose across the planet
[1:21:56.500 --> 1:22:00.460]  Didn't mean I liked Obama, but I was sure watching him close. Weren't you?
[1:22:03.140 --> 1:22:05.140]  But I do like Putin
[1:22:05.180 --> 1:22:10.540]  And not because any Russian bots ever helped me I like Putin because he's a maverick and it stood against the globalist
[1:22:10.540 --> 1:22:18.540]  And he's got this country back to a certain extent and it's promoting having children and family values and doing things that the
[1:22:18.780 --> 1:22:20.780]  700 club will hardly do today
[1:22:21.660 --> 1:22:27.620]  So, yeah, do I like the 700 club? Yeah, they're better than CNN. Do I like Vladimir Putin? Yeah, he's better than CNN
[1:22:27.620 --> 1:22:30.500]  I've never seen proof he had any media people killed
[1:22:32.180 --> 1:22:35.260]  That most of time you look it up. It's some leftist at the left killed
[1:22:35.260 --> 1:22:39.780]  But you know what? I've seen plenty of journalists killed here
[1:22:40.540 --> 1:22:45.100]  And I've seen what they've done to me and I've seen the attack on the press and so it's disgusting
[1:22:45.100 --> 1:22:49.260]  I saw CNN had a big article out criticizing China for Tiananmen Square
[1:22:49.740 --> 1:22:52.020]  Sort of the New York Times and there they were
[1:22:52.420 --> 1:22:58.380]  Right there in their own paper saying shut me up. Take me off here right next to it. That's disgusting
[1:22:58.980 --> 1:23:01.420]  How stupid do you think we are CNN?
[1:23:01.420 --> 1:23:08.380]  Jim Acosta, I got the clip coming up. He was on that with Anderson Cooper
[1:23:10.220 --> 1:23:14.420]  And he was talking about how Trump's waging war against the press and
[1:23:14.900 --> 1:23:18.700]  How don't worry when we get in power. We're gonna really wage war on you
[1:23:19.060 --> 1:23:24.340]  Trump hasn't shut any of you down. Trump hasn't sued you. Trump isn't calling for you to be off the air
[1:23:24.340 --> 1:23:29.540]  He's just saying you're a bunch of liars and the enemy you are lobbying to take me off the air
[1:23:29.540 --> 1:23:34.420]  You've shut me down. Oh, you've taken my bank accounts away. I'm getting ready to fall suit over it
[1:23:34.940 --> 1:23:36.620]  You don't care
[1:23:36.620 --> 1:23:39.860]  Because you got billionaires financing you and you think you'll win in the end
[1:23:39.860 --> 1:23:44.140]  You know you'll lose these suits, but well, that'll be three years down the road when the country's already gone
[1:23:49.620 --> 1:23:54.820]  Everything they say about us is what they do he goes on and on with with the
[1:23:55.780 --> 1:23:57.780]  one of the richest people in the world and
[1:23:57.780 --> 1:24:04.620]  It's a Cooper is one of the worst people in the world. So you pull up articles that says, oh, he gave all his money away as a young man
[1:24:06.500 --> 1:24:11.500]  Oh, just like Bill and Linda Gates, they gave it all away to a tax exempt foundation
[1:24:11.500 --> 1:24:17.260]  So they pay zero tax on their helicopters and their yachts in there
[1:24:18.180 --> 1:24:19.780]  Yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah
[1:24:19.780 --> 1:24:26.300]  He's as rich as Bill Gates or more, which is fine except all day. He tells you how bad money is
[1:24:26.300 --> 1:24:28.300]  Just like Warren Buffett
[1:24:32.180 --> 1:24:36.780]  Warren Buffett puts on this little nice guy attitude. Oh, he's got the same house in Omaha
[1:24:37.220 --> 1:24:41.220]  His whole you know life and his dad was this little conservative congressman
[1:24:42.860 --> 1:24:46.860]  Warren Buffett's banks are the worst when it comes to laundering drug money. Look it up
[1:24:47.100 --> 1:24:49.100]  He was the biggest recipient
[1:24:49.460 --> 1:24:51.460]  487 billion dollars of
[1:24:51.460 --> 1:24:59.060]  The banker bailout in 2008, but he writes a check every year of the national debt of a couple thousand dollars
[1:24:59.460 --> 1:25:02.300]  In a stunt worth millions of advertising and
[1:25:03.100 --> 1:25:07.780]  Talks about I'm rich. I need to pay more taxes. Is that why he put it all
[1:25:09.180 --> 1:25:15.500]  Into capital gains and into captive insurance, mr. Buffett where you don't pay any tax
[1:25:15.500 --> 1:25:22.020]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, and then you're the biggest recipient in US history of taxpayer money
[1:25:22.020 --> 1:25:27.340]  Of course, you want rich people to pay more that means anybody over a hundred and ten thousand dollars
[1:25:27.860 --> 1:25:33.500]  Got their taxes raised by Obama and where'd that money go right to Warren Buffett? Oh
[1:25:34.100 --> 1:25:36.100]  Now we know why
[1:25:38.180 --> 1:25:41.540]  Now we know why he wants the rich to pay more
[1:25:41.540 --> 1:25:44.340]  Because the rich is you
[1:25:45.580 --> 1:25:47.260]  Not him
[1:25:47.260 --> 1:25:50.140]  You make a hundred and ten thousand dollars a year your money
[1:25:50.140 --> 1:25:56.260]  I saw some number like that year the average taxpayers sent over a hundred dollars to Warren Buffett
[1:25:57.380 --> 1:26:03.980]  Every taxpayer a hundred bucks Warren by here mr. Buffett. Here's a hundred dollars my money. Oh, I'm just a nice little man
[1:26:03.980 --> 1:26:09.420]  I run some banks now. They keep getting caught laundering the narcotics and other things
[1:26:09.420 --> 1:26:16.380]  And they've got some jets that at least from me that the CIA runs that some other things happen
[1:26:16.380 --> 1:26:18.660]  Oh, and I'm Warren Buffett and then Bill Gates
[1:26:18.660 --> 1:26:21.860]  There's all these PR pieces pop the Bill and one of the Gates Foundation
[1:26:21.860 --> 1:26:27.780]  They put hundreds of billions in together so they pay no tax on it and they own run everything on the tax refoundation
[1:26:29.980 --> 1:26:31.980]  These are apex predators
[1:26:32.180 --> 1:26:38.420]  They have constant PR pieces where they're at Dairy Queen serving Dairy Queen to poor people
[1:26:38.420 --> 1:26:45.580]  Oh, oh and their little buddies and they just met back in the 80s by accident. It wasn't that Bill Gates's father
[1:26:46.220 --> 1:26:49.980]  Was on the board of the eugenics Foundation with Warren Buffett
[1:26:53.460 --> 1:26:55.140]  Yeah
[1:26:55.140 --> 1:26:57.140]  Anyone can go look this up
[1:26:57.500 --> 1:27:00.700]  Apex predators and you know, I was death-threaded two years ago
[1:27:00.700 --> 1:27:04.660]  I was told if you keep talking about Bill among the gates people are gonna die
[1:27:04.660 --> 1:27:07.700]  Kill your hand. Go ahead. I don't care. I
[1:27:08.860 --> 1:27:11.980]  Don't have a death wish jerk off, but I'll tell you this
[1:27:13.860 --> 1:27:15.940]  You got a sick plan, I'll tell you that man
[1:27:18.340 --> 1:27:26.540]  You want to flood us with super violent folks from the Congo turn them against America
[1:27:27.660 --> 1:27:30.540]  And then make sure you abort as many of them as possible
[1:27:30.540 --> 1:27:33.660]  What a sick weird algorithm
[1:27:34.980 --> 1:27:39.300]  And you know Bill Gates really wants to make sure we get rid of the black people
[1:27:40.260 --> 1:27:42.460]  But then he funds the leftist foundations
[1:27:43.300 --> 1:27:46.420]  Bringing them in and making them hate white people
[1:27:46.940 --> 1:27:50.860]  That only sounds like something the devil would come up with right doesn't it?
[1:27:51.500 --> 1:27:53.500]  So see I don't want to kill these black people
[1:27:54.860 --> 1:27:58.820]  But since they've been weaponized and brainwashed and told I'm bad
[1:27:58.820 --> 1:28:04.540]  I'm Bill Gates and the Democrats and the Ford Foundation. What am I supposed to do?
[1:28:05.780 --> 1:28:09.300]  I'm going to fight anything you push buddy boy
[1:28:10.620 --> 1:28:16.180]  And so we project on to these black people from the Congo that they're these angel cakes
[1:28:16.900 --> 1:28:19.900]  When the Congo is the most violent
[1:28:20.580 --> 1:28:22.100]  out of control
[1:28:22.100 --> 1:28:24.100]  barbarous place in the world
[1:28:25.220 --> 1:28:27.220]  other than Somalia and
[1:28:27.220 --> 1:28:32.020]  And we've learned you import Somalis and you import Congonese, baby
[1:28:33.260 --> 1:28:39.340]  You get a lot of death and a lot of crime and a lot of problems
[1:28:40.500 --> 1:28:44.380]  So just put that in your pipe. Oh, I'm sorry. I haven't gotten to Putin yet
[1:28:44.380 --> 1:28:47.700]  I'll play that. Oh, how many people is Putin bringing it from the Congo?
[1:28:47.700 --> 1:28:56.940]  Zero, how many is Saudi Arabia bringing in zero? How many is Japan bringing in zero?
[1:28:57.460 --> 1:29:03.140]  Fellow patriots, my name is Todd Savage founder of black rifle real estate comm like you

[1:29:58.420 --> 1:30:04.860]  Recent studies and reports have shown that pipes and plumbing are getting clogged and
[1:30:04.860 --> 1:30:12.460]  Backed up with human waste and debris. This is from people flushing things that aren't meant to be flushed
[1:30:12.780 --> 1:30:18.180]  Like baby wipes and feminine products and safe sex products
[1:30:18.180 --> 1:30:22.340]  And so this is resulting in pipes being backed up and clogged
[1:30:22.860 --> 1:30:29.540]  Well, just like plumbing gets clogged and just like pipes get clogged the human body gets clogged just like that

[1:31:05.580 --> 1:31:09.860]  I'm so excited. I'm such a big fan ever since I've been listening. I've been buying your products
[1:31:09.860 --> 1:31:17.700]  I got to do a shout out for the bone broth. The bone broth. The bone broth. The bone broth. The bone broth.
[1:31:17.700 --> 1:31:22.420]  It tastes like tastes like great milkshake, you know, if you just add it to milk
[1:31:22.420 --> 1:31:28.340]  It tastes like oval theme. It tastes like oval theme. It tastes like oval theme. Like good.
[1:31:28.340 --> 1:31:34.100]  I feel great since I've been taking it. My daughter uses the bubblegum fluoride free toothpaste
[1:31:34.540 --> 1:31:40.100]  I've used the supermail vitality a host of other products. So thank you so much for that as well

[1:32:05.100 --> 1:32:08.980]  I got mobbed on the streets by fans that almost all of them said we used to love you on air

[1:32:25.820 --> 1:32:28.340]  So we're there folks, tomorrow's news, today
[1:32:28.340 --> 1:32:39.340]  infowarstore.com
[1:32:39.340 --> 1:32:44.180]  I'm at infowarstore.com and newswarstore.com. We knew this censorship is coming forever
[1:32:44.180 --> 1:32:48.700]  We have our own video streams, our own audio streams, and it's all free to air. Anybody can use it
[1:32:48.700 --> 1:32:53.620]  Reupload and do whatever you want. People go to infowarstore.com and newswarstore.com. That's where they find it
[1:32:53.620 --> 1:33:00.620]  You know, there's what they call websites. You just go there
[1:33:00.620 --> 1:33:13.620]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:33:13.620 --> 1:33:25.620]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:33:25.620 --> 1:33:33.620]  By the way, I was talking to the Cruder in the break about the depopulation plan and why at first they allowed the population to bloom
[1:33:33.620 --> 1:33:40.620]  and then later they're going to wipe it all out and I was explaining different state department memorandums explaining this
[1:33:40.620 --> 1:33:49.620]  Quote the Royal Commission on Population Commission for his Royal Highness in England in 1949
[1:33:49.620 --> 1:33:54.620]  For that guitar. National security study from random 200
[1:33:54.620 --> 1:34:02.620]  Henry Kissinger, 1975, not declassified until 1992
[1:34:02.620 --> 1:34:08.620]  And let me just explain to folks again. I don't just sit up here and say all this stuff, okay
[1:34:08.620 --> 1:34:15.620]  And the plan is so diabolical, so diabolical
[1:34:15.620 --> 1:34:23.620]  Keep the third world dumb, don't industrialize them, then let their population balloon and then weaponize them against the west
[1:34:23.620 --> 1:34:29.620]  But then dump your toxic waste and stuff down there
[1:34:29.620 --> 1:34:34.620]  And then later basically have bioweapons that reduce their population
[1:34:34.620 --> 1:34:42.620]  They use the third world as a weapon first and then once we've been flooded with a few hundred million per nation of illegal aliens
[1:34:42.620 --> 1:34:49.620]  Everybody's going to quietly go, oh thank God, when the bioweapon gets released, that's very specific
[1:34:49.620 --> 1:34:55.620]  You know, I really feel like my immortal soul will be on the line if I cheer a couple billion Africans dying
[1:34:55.620 --> 1:35:00.620]  You know what I mean? Even if they're being brainwashed and hyped up, I left this to come and to slit my throat
[1:35:00.620 --> 1:35:07.620]  Which they are. I mean, look what's going on. I just like, I know the plan. It's like, why are we doing this?
[1:35:07.620 --> 1:35:14.620]  I don't want to kill black people, but you see the globalists are going to force everyone into knowing what's happening
[1:35:14.620 --> 1:35:20.620]  And by then we'll have all the big walls up and all the big controls and the big police state
[1:35:20.620 --> 1:35:29.620]  And we'll all be somewhat safe, you know, you know, Africa half the population will die, Latin America half of it will die, most the Arabs will die
[1:35:29.620 --> 1:35:34.620]  And because you have some cross species jumping of stuff, you're going to have millions dead in western countries
[1:35:34.620 --> 1:35:38.620]  And it's going to be, it's going to be rough
[1:35:38.620 --> 1:35:47.620]  But if a man's got to make it, he's got to be tough. So I gave you that name to help you along
[1:35:47.620 --> 1:35:54.620]  My name is Sue. How do you do? Now you're going to die!
[1:35:54.620 --> 1:35:58.620]  Can we come in with a boy named Sue next segment?
[1:35:58.620 --> 1:36:04.620]  Anyways, you have to understand, folks, I'm giving you the actual plan. You don't have to worry about the Africans taking over.
[1:36:04.620 --> 1:36:10.620]  They're going to be debtored and doornails. They've already been hit with a weaponized HIV that mutates very quickly
[1:36:10.620 --> 1:36:15.620]  And it's put out in different, the HIV you hear about in the US is not the real HIV.
[1:36:15.620 --> 1:36:23.620]  They just use that cover story for people that use a lot of methamphetamine and are dying from, you know, master amounts of drugs and things
[1:36:23.620 --> 1:36:32.620]  Very, very rare for any real strains of HIV to be here because Europeans don't have receptor sites for it
[1:36:32.620 --> 1:36:40.620]  A black person can walk by the HIV virus and get it. Why do you can't?
[1:36:40.620 --> 1:36:46.620]  And so, yeah, I really don't like killing black people. You know, that's why Louis Faircon and all those guys, you know, years ago, think I'm great and stuff
[1:36:46.620 --> 1:36:51.620]  And Professor Griffin and all that because they tune in and they've got all those same documents. They know I'm not lying about it
[1:36:51.620 --> 1:36:57.620]  And I'm like, okay, you don't like white people, you know, I get it, but you know, here's the deal. You do the same damn thing if you were in charge
[1:36:57.620 --> 1:37:04.620]  I'm not saying those people would, but that's how the system works. Let's stop lying about how the world works
[1:37:04.620 --> 1:37:17.620]  I see little black kids, little cute black kids walking down the street. I don't want to kill them
[1:37:17.620 --> 1:37:21.620]  Let me tell you a lot of people do
[1:37:21.620 --> 1:37:30.620]  And again, the way the devil works is the devil's going to get everybody wound up in a fight where we play along to his music
[1:37:30.620 --> 1:37:36.620]  And we're all killing each other like a bunch of idiots. The average white person is not racist
[1:37:36.620 --> 1:37:43.620]  In fact, the average white person's religion is hating themselves and trying to prove that they're really good
[1:37:43.620 --> 1:37:50.620]  Because they took our Christian ethos where we know we're falling in bad and the new religion is hating your whiteness
[1:37:50.620 --> 1:37:55.620]  Which fits into a Christian cosmology of being guilty about our sin
[1:37:55.620 --> 1:38:01.620]  I don't know who that lady is on screen, but my god
[1:38:01.620 --> 1:38:06.620]  But that's how this stuff really works, folks
[1:38:06.620 --> 1:38:12.620]  But up above it all are the apex predators, Warren Buffett Bill Gates
[1:38:12.620 --> 1:38:17.620]  And you see the PR about him, it is just ridiculous
[1:38:17.620 --> 1:38:21.620]  And most of it has been in response to my attacks
[1:38:21.620 --> 1:38:27.620]  A lot of people tell me that you say, man, you might want to leave those boys alone
[1:38:27.620 --> 1:38:34.620]  It's not a white ally or knight in shining armor thing
[1:38:34.620 --> 1:38:50.620]  When I don't want to bio weapon all the black people, the race-specific bio weapon, I'm against that because that's evil
[1:38:50.620 --> 1:38:55.620]  But see, they're going to put us in a position
[1:38:55.620 --> 1:38:58.620]  Globalist are
[1:38:58.620 --> 1:39:03.620]  But it won't matter when you're being hunted because you're white
[1:39:03.620 --> 1:39:13.620]  You're going to think the air cavalry arrived when all this goes down and they're just going to get you next
[1:39:13.620 --> 1:39:21.620]  They've got a plan, ladies and gentlemen, the globalists have a big club and we ain't in it
[1:39:21.620 --> 1:39:27.620]  But they need all the air traffic controllers, all the military and all the scientists and all the technicians
[1:39:27.620 --> 1:39:35.620]  Stay in place while the robots replace all human factories, activities, surveillance, security
[1:39:35.620 --> 1:39:40.620]  So that when the third world gets wiped out
[1:39:40.620 --> 1:39:46.620]  By then everything's automated here so that humans can be basically phased out
[1:39:46.620 --> 1:39:54.620]  So that when the last groups of Europeans get exterminated, 50 years from now
[1:39:54.620 --> 1:40:01.620]  Maybe sooner, you'll never know what hit you, but I have given you the prime projection
[1:40:01.620 --> 1:40:07.620]  This is not my opinion, this is the plan and I hope you're smart enough and I know you are to listen to me
[1:40:07.620 --> 1:40:16.620]  Because I've given you the best thinking by the globalists and what their plan is and what they are currently executing
[1:40:16.620 --> 1:40:27.620]  And they're madder than a hatter that I'm on air telling you all this because I was supposed to join them and I've had the offers
[1:40:27.620 --> 1:40:43.620]  I'm not going to sit in some bunker in Lanai or Tasmania or Kauai or Arctic Circle in Northern Canada and watch 7 million people get wiped out
[1:40:43.620 --> 1:40:50.620]  I'm not going to do it, but I'm going to tell all the racists Hispanics and racists blacks and racists everybody else that hate me because who I am
[1:40:50.620 --> 1:40:55.620]  Listen, you come to my house to kill me, I'll defend myself because you're a dumb idiot
[1:40:55.620 --> 1:40:59.620]  Just like the white supremacists all of it, we're all being played off against each other
[1:40:59.620 --> 1:41:07.620]  So here's the deal, I'm not going to accept an African invasion, I'm not going to accept invasions from Latin America with a bunch of bitching and griping people that want to get in here
[1:41:07.620 --> 1:41:11.620]  And then tell me I did something to you, I reject that
[1:41:11.620 --> 1:41:20.620]  But me rejecting your BS and the globalist BS at that level is not the big enchilada
[1:41:20.620 --> 1:41:25.620]  The big enchilada is that there's an end game to this
[1:41:25.620 --> 1:41:31.620]  You don't think the globalists that really don't like black people
[1:41:31.620 --> 1:41:39.620]  You don't think they're just going to let a ton of Africans in with no jobs and no future for no reason
[1:41:39.620 --> 1:41:44.620]  I tell them dead in the hammer
[1:41:44.620 --> 1:41:48.620]  So everybody better put this on a thumb drive and put it in a safe
[1:41:48.620 --> 1:41:56.620]  And then when all this happens have an old device you can plug it in and show people and they're going to say how do you know this
[1:41:56.620 --> 1:42:02.620]  I'm going to explain it again, it's a public plan my friends
[1:42:02.620 --> 1:42:09.620]  I still haven't played the Putin clip, it's on infowords.com, Putin warrants the end of the world, but you know I've got four children
[1:42:09.620 --> 1:42:13.620]  I don't want a nuclear war, I don't want to die by fire, a radioactive winter
[1:42:13.620 --> 1:42:23.620]  But you know, I wouldn't blame God if God just allowed there to be a nuclear war so the globalists just don't get the things they want
[1:42:23.620 --> 1:42:32.620]  But you know what I think, I know the Bible is true, that the devil will be given power for one hour and in the times of about a year
[1:42:32.620 --> 1:42:41.620]  The best thinking is about a year, but the robots, the AI, the total surveillance and all the hordes of people that are going to be in league with it
[1:42:41.620 --> 1:42:51.620]  Are going to have one year to purge us that are Christians, black Christians, white Christians, Hispanic Christians, old Christians, young Christians
[1:42:51.620 --> 1:42:56.620]  The truth is what unifies us is Jesus Christ, we better get Jesus now
[1:42:56.620 --> 1:43:04.620]  The globalists are hyper competitive scientific dictators, they are technocrats, they are control freaks in their own words
[1:43:04.620 --> 1:43:11.620]  And they believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own decisions gets to the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods
[1:43:11.620 --> 1:43:16.620]  Now we're fighting them hard in cyberspace, we're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension
[1:43:16.620 --> 1:43:22.620]  And one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies
[1:43:22.620 --> 1:43:27.620]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from ForrestLive.com, I couldn't do it
[1:43:27.620 --> 1:43:37.620]  That's why we decided to take our original Secret 12 that was incredibly high quality medical bottleman and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12
[1:43:37.620 --> 1:43:43.620]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12 over the counter that you're going to find anywhere
[1:43:43.620 --> 1:43:52.620]  It is amazing, experience pure medical bottleman B12 for yourself and fund the second American evolution against the tyrants at InfoWarsStore.com
[1:43:52.620 --> 1:43:56.620]  InfoWarsLive.com or AAA 253-3139
[1:43:56.620 --> 1:44:01.620]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world
[1:44:01.620 --> 1:44:10.620]  So the InfoWars model is a self-fulfilling, self-supporting structure that is promoting free press and free speech by people getting together and supporting one another
[1:44:10.620 --> 1:44:16.620]  It is the only independent press of this size and scale, of this public reach
[1:44:16.620 --> 1:44:23.620]  It is the one model that says, here's a way to have a self-supporting, self-sustaining, self-structured, little de-democratic structure
[1:44:23.620 --> 1:44:31.620]  That because the audience determines what content goes up, the audience determines what audience is ultimately reached by their choices and supporting InfoWars
[1:44:31.620 --> 1:44:40.620]  And it's all because the audience spends their whatever it is, whether it's $5 or $50 a month on products that they like and that they want that actually compete with the corporate driven model
[1:44:40.620 --> 1:44:49.620]  And the ability to do that and at the same time support press, support speech, support letting the audience choose what news they want to see and what views they want to hold
[1:44:49.620 --> 1:44:56.620]  And it's the ultimate American democratic expression and experiment and it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets
[1:44:56.620 --> 1:45:04.620]  Nourish a probiotic friendly environment in your gut with prebiotic fiber by InfoWars Life

[1:47:15.620 --> 1:47:21.620]  Because the owners of this country don't want that, I'm talking about the real owners now
[1:47:21.620 --> 1:47:27.620]  The real owners, the big wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions
[1:47:27.620 --> 1:47:33.620]  Forget the politicians, the politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice
[1:47:33.620 --> 1:47:39.620]  You don't, you have no choice, you have owners, they own you
[1:47:39.620 --> 1:47:45.620]  They own everything, they own all the important land, they own and control the corporations
[1:47:45.620 --> 1:47:50.620]  They've long since bought and paid for the senate, the congress, the state houses and city halls, they got the judges in their back pockets
[1:47:50.620 --> 1:47:55.620]  And they own all the big media companies so they control just about all the news and information you get to hear
[1:47:55.620 --> 1:47:58.620]  They got you by the balls
[1:47:58.620 --> 1:48:03.620]  They want obedient workers, obedient workers
[1:48:03.620 --> 1:48:06.620]  People who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork
[1:48:06.620 --> 1:48:13.620]  And just dumb enough to passively accept jobs with the lower pay, the longer hours, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime
[1:48:13.620 --> 1:48:16.620]  And the vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it
[1:48:16.620 --> 1:48:19.620]  And now they're coming for your social security money
[1:48:19.620 --> 1:48:23.620]  So they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street
[1:48:23.620 --> 1:48:27.620]  It's a big club and you ain't in it
[1:48:27.620 --> 1:48:30.620]  You and I are not in the big club
[1:48:30.620 --> 1:48:34.620]  The owners of this country know the truth, it's called the American Dream
[1:48:34.620 --> 1:48:37.620]  Because you have to be asleep to believe it
[1:48:37.620 --> 1:48:43.620]  But I'll tell you what, they don't want, they don't want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking
[1:48:43.620 --> 1:48:47.620]  They don't want well informed, well educated people capable of critical thinking
[1:48:47.620 --> 1:48:51.620]  Then I mentioned that, that doesn't help them, that's against their interest
[1:48:51.620 --> 1:48:53.620]  That's right
[1:48:53.620 --> 1:49:00.620]  Still alive in the Info War, George Carlin from The Grave
[1:49:06.620 --> 1:49:12.620]  But Trump comes in and the entire power structure goes into conniption fits
[1:49:12.620 --> 1:49:16.620]  He says, make everybody poor, break up families, why?
[1:49:16.620 --> 1:49:25.620]  It works good, men and women, children, factories, farms, our military, our teachers, our people
[1:49:25.620 --> 1:49:27.620]  Why would we do this?
[1:49:27.620 --> 1:49:30.620]  Why would we sacrifice humanity on the ultra-globalism?
[1:49:30.620 --> 1:49:34.620]  Remember what Elon Musk warned of, he goes, I go to these billionaire meetings
[1:49:34.620 --> 1:49:38.620]  And I talk about the world government killing everybody and how the AI gods are going to replace us
[1:49:38.620 --> 1:49:41.620]  Folks, it's in all the literature
[1:49:41.620 --> 1:49:44.620]  People keep wondering like, how does Jones know what's going to happen next?
[1:49:44.620 --> 1:49:47.620]  These crazy people tell us
[1:49:51.620 --> 1:49:55.620]  And then they control the third world, they dumb it down, they destroy it
[1:49:55.620 --> 1:49:58.620]  They weaponize it where then you don't have a choice
[1:49:58.620 --> 1:50:03.620]  But to agree with them to wipe out the third world, how evil
[1:50:03.620 --> 1:50:07.620]  So we have to fight the globalists now
[1:50:07.620 --> 1:50:11.620]  We have to push the Americana 1776 prosperity model
[1:50:11.620 --> 1:50:14.620]  We've got to try to support places like Brazil
[1:50:14.620 --> 1:50:17.620]  And many other places that are trying to actually empower their people
[1:50:17.620 --> 1:50:22.620]  And we've got to stand against the globalists, ladies and gentlemen
[1:50:22.620 --> 1:50:28.620]  I've talked for 50 minutes in this hour and I haven't played the Putin clip I talked about
[1:50:28.620 --> 1:50:33.620]  But it's up on infowords.com, but it's just him warning nuclear war at the end of the world
[1:50:33.620 --> 1:50:41.620]  Let's roll it and I will read the captions of the full video on infowords.com and newswords.com
[1:50:41.620 --> 1:50:46.620]  MaximAlert, Putin issues dire warning, plus U.S. border, the political apps is a very important page
[1:50:46.620 --> 1:50:51.620]  Hope you'll share it, because our media has a blackout on this video, here it is
[1:50:54.620 --> 1:50:59.620]  If no one is interested in renewing the START treaty, we will not renew it
[1:50:59.620 --> 1:51:04.620]  We've already said 100 times that we are ready to do so
[1:51:04.620 --> 1:51:07.620]  But no one is willing to talk about it with us
[1:51:07.620 --> 1:51:12.620]  Please note that there is no formal negotiation process
[1:51:12.620 --> 1:51:15.620]  And everything will expire in 2021
[1:51:15.620 --> 1:51:20.620]  Mind you, there will be no more instruments to limit an arms race
[1:51:20.620 --> 1:51:23.620]  For example, deploying weapons in outer space
[1:51:23.620 --> 1:51:29.620]  We will understand what, back it up, sorry, back it up 10 seconds, he's talking too fast
[1:51:29.620 --> 1:51:34.620]  Just like I do, start over, there'll be nothing to limit, go
[1:51:34.620 --> 1:51:37.620]  Deploying weapons in outer space
[1:51:37.620 --> 1:51:41.620]  Do we understand what this means or not? Ask the experts
[1:51:41.620 --> 1:51:47.620]  It means that each of us, take it under a nuclear weapon
[1:51:47.620 --> 1:51:51.620]  Permanently
[1:51:51.620 --> 1:51:53.620]  We're doing this, and we're doing it quickly
[1:51:53.620 --> 1:51:55.620]  Will anyone ever think about it?
[1:51:55.620 --> 1:52:01.620]  Talk about it, or show any concern
[1:52:01.620 --> 1:52:04.620]  No complete silence
[1:52:04.620 --> 1:52:08.620]  Or take low-yield nuclear weapons
[1:52:08.620 --> 1:52:12.620]  Or non-nuclear strategic missiles
[1:52:12.620 --> 1:52:19.620]  One of a global range strategic missile is launched from a submarine in the middle of the ocean
[1:52:19.620 --> 1:52:21.620]  How do we know?
[1:52:21.620 --> 1:52:23.620]  It carries a nuclear weapon or not
[1:52:23.620 --> 1:52:27.620]  We realize how serious and dangerous this is
[1:52:27.620 --> 1:52:30.620]  The full report is very powerful, because you have to understand
[1:52:30.620 --> 1:52:35.620]  They've got supersonic missiles from submarines and air launched and others
[1:52:35.620 --> 1:52:38.620]  Where you don't know if it has a nuclear weapon or not
[1:52:38.620 --> 1:52:42.620]  And so you see jets firing weapons, submarines firing weapons
[1:52:42.620 --> 1:52:47.620]  Into your airspace, up from the submarines, out from the aircraft
[1:52:47.620 --> 1:52:50.620]  Drop from space, and here's Putin admitting
[1:52:50.620 --> 1:52:54.620]  Okay, they're putting nuclear weapons in space, so are we
[1:52:54.620 --> 1:53:00.620]  Do you really want satellites floating over with nuclear weapons?
[1:53:00.620 --> 1:53:06.620]  Every 15 minutes or whatever it is, I think it's 15 minutes at those speeds
[1:53:06.620 --> 1:53:09.620]  It varies, I think it's an orbit every 15 minutes
[1:53:09.620 --> 1:53:13.620]  There's geo-synchronous where you stay in one spot, then there's the other one
[1:53:13.620 --> 1:53:17.620]  You've got, now we don't just want satellites and satellite junk
[1:53:17.620 --> 1:53:19.620]  Now we've got nukes flying around everywhere
[1:53:19.620 --> 1:53:22.620]  That's really a great idea
[1:53:22.620 --> 1:53:26.620]  We need space force to build a human future
[1:53:26.620 --> 1:53:28.620]  We need space force to build colonies
[1:53:28.620 --> 1:53:31.620]  We need space force to explore the universe
[1:53:31.620 --> 1:53:35.620]  There's unlimited space for humanity everywhere
[1:53:35.620 --> 1:53:38.620]  But they want us fighting over limited resources here
[1:53:38.620 --> 1:53:43.620]  And I'm not against the United States having strategic defense weapons in space
[1:53:43.620 --> 1:53:48.620]  That are non-nuclear, smart pebble, satellite killers, whatever for the Chinese
[1:53:48.620 --> 1:53:50.620]  Because they're deploying them
[1:53:50.620 --> 1:53:52.620]  Russia wants to economically develop
[1:53:52.620 --> 1:53:54.620]  They know they got bankrupted and arms raised before
[1:53:54.620 --> 1:53:56.620]  They don't want to have to do this
[1:53:56.620 --> 1:53:59.620]  In fact, Putin cut defense spending the last two years
[1:53:59.620 --> 1:54:06.620]  To say, hey, I'm cutting defense spending, the globalists don't care
[1:54:06.620 --> 1:54:10.620]  So ladies and gentlemen, everything is out of control right now
[1:54:10.620 --> 1:54:13.620]  And it's extremely dangerous
[1:54:13.620 --> 1:54:18.620]  We're going to try to break this down as best we can
[1:54:18.620 --> 1:54:20.620]  I'm going to go to break
[1:54:20.620 --> 1:54:25.620]  And I don't have enough time to tell you the news I've got coming up next hour
[1:54:25.620 --> 1:54:29.620]  But it's extremely important with Millie Weaver
[1:54:29.620 --> 1:54:32.620]  I'll tell you once we get her on what's happening
[1:54:32.620 --> 1:54:35.620]  I'm going to not belabor this because quite frankly, it's real simple
[1:54:35.620 --> 1:54:38.620]  There isn't more important work being done out there
[1:54:38.620 --> 1:54:40.620]  And I don't say that from a power perspective
[1:54:40.620 --> 1:54:42.620]  I say it really scared like
[1:54:42.620 --> 1:54:46.620]  Info Wars is one of the most effective groups promoting a pro-human future in the world
[1:54:46.620 --> 1:54:48.620]  And it actually knows what's going on
[1:54:48.620 --> 1:54:50.620]  Why isn't everyone adopting what we're saying?
[1:54:50.620 --> 1:54:51.620]  Because we're really researching
[1:54:51.620 --> 1:54:54.620]  Well, people are actually adopting what we're saying
[1:54:54.620 --> 1:54:56.620]  We're actually winning thanks to you supporting us
[1:54:56.620 --> 1:55:01.620]  You are just as important as anybody in this office as a viewer, as a listener
[1:55:01.620 --> 1:55:06.620]  Unlike other broadcasts where you just get programmed and you become a minion
[1:55:06.620 --> 1:55:12.620]  And a spectator, you are the man or the woman in the arena
[1:55:12.620 --> 1:55:15.620]  When you do one of three things
[1:55:15.620 --> 1:55:18.620]  Pray for us, which is the most important
[1:55:18.620 --> 1:55:21.620]  Spread our links and our articles and our information
[1:55:21.620 --> 1:55:23.620]  Which is paramount
[1:55:23.620 --> 1:55:25.620]  And then financially support us
[1:55:25.620 --> 1:55:30.620]  Money allows me to fight George Soros and Hillary and the globalists
[1:55:30.620 --> 1:55:33.620]  And every month we stay on air
[1:55:33.620 --> 1:55:35.620]  Every time I don't lay people off
[1:55:35.620 --> 1:55:40.620]  That I try to expand is victory
[1:55:40.620 --> 1:55:43.620]  Because we're going to be here as the platform into the future
[1:55:43.620 --> 1:55:48.620]  That is going to fire truth bombs right up the rear end of the globalist
[1:55:48.620 --> 1:55:51.620]  I mean, not physically, but metaphysically
[1:55:51.620 --> 1:55:55.620]  As a parable, as an allegory, as an analogy
[1:55:55.620 --> 1:55:59.620]  You cannot spend your money in a place
[1:55:59.620 --> 1:56:04.620]  Where you're going to get a bigger return for a pro-human future
[1:56:04.620 --> 1:56:05.620]  You cannot do it
[1:56:05.620 --> 1:56:08.620]  So I hate sitting there asking for your support
[1:56:08.620 --> 1:56:10.620]  I'm just going to tell you right now
[1:56:10.620 --> 1:56:14.620]  I appreciate your support, but if you don't support us and commit to do it
[1:56:14.620 --> 1:56:16.620]  We'll be destroyed
[1:56:16.620 --> 1:56:19.620]  And you know, a sick part of me that's been in this fight so long
[1:56:19.620 --> 1:56:21.620]  Is going to be like, let him knock me out of this fight
[1:56:21.620 --> 1:56:23.620]  I've been going so hard, but you know, I want to stay in
[1:56:23.620 --> 1:56:25.620]  And I pray to God to keep me in all the way
[1:56:25.620 --> 1:56:28.620]  Because I don't fear death, but I do fear these people take it over
[1:56:28.620 --> 1:56:31.620]  Because it's spiritual death
[1:56:31.620 --> 1:56:34.620]  We have a special that's going to have to end next week
[1:56:34.620 --> 1:56:36.620]  And we call it the total super-force special
[1:56:36.620 --> 1:56:40.620]  Tim had the idea of like, we got a lot of products with the name 4-7
[1:56:40.620 --> 1:56:43.620]  DNA Force Plus with the PQQ and CoQ-10
[1:56:43.620 --> 1:56:46.620]  That's so amazing for your telomeres, your DNA, your body
[1:56:46.620 --> 1:56:47.620]  It's the best formula out there

[1:56:54.620 --> 1:56:56.620]  It's just incredible
[1:56:56.620 --> 1:56:59.620]  DNA Force Plus, just, it's thousands of dollars a kilo
[1:56:59.620 --> 1:57:01.620]  For the PQQ and the CoQ-10
[1:57:01.620 --> 1:57:04.620]  I mean, it's just, it's the magic sauce
[1:57:04.620 --> 1:57:06.620]  Brain Force Plus is amazing, clean, neutropic
[1:57:06.620 --> 1:57:08.620]  Very low price on that

[1:59:50.620 --> 1:59:58.620]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show
[1:59:58.620 --> 2:00:01.620]  The bottom line on nuclear weapons is
[2:00:01.620 --> 2:00:03.620]  That when the president gives the order
[2:00:03.620 --> 2:00:06.620]  It must be followed
[2:00:06.620 --> 2:00:09.620]  There's about four minutes between the order being given
[2:00:09.620 --> 2:00:13.620]  And the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons
[2:00:13.620 --> 2:00:14.620]  To do so
[2:00:14.620 --> 2:00:17.620]  As president, I will make it clear
[2:00:17.620 --> 2:00:20.620]  That the United States will treat cyber attacks
[2:00:20.620 --> 2:00:22.620]  Just like any other attack
[2:00:22.620 --> 2:00:25.620]  We will be ready with serious political,
[2:00:25.620 --> 2:00:28.620]  Economic and military responses
[2:00:28.620 --> 2:00:30.620]  They're voting for peace on planet Earth
[2:00:30.620 --> 2:00:31.620]  If they vote for Trump
[2:00:31.620 --> 2:00:33.620]  But if they vote for Hillary
[2:00:33.620 --> 2:00:34.620]  It's war
[2:00:34.620 --> 2:00:35.620]  We came
[2:00:35.620 --> 2:00:36.620]  We saw
[2:00:36.620 --> 2:00:39.620]  He died
[2:00:39.620 --> 2:00:41.620]  With her, you'll end up in World War 3
[2:00:41.620 --> 2:00:43.620]  I want the Iranians to know
[2:00:43.620 --> 2:00:45.620]  That if I'm the president, we will attack Iran
[2:00:45.620 --> 2:00:49.620]  Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace
[2:00:49.620 --> 2:00:52.620]  In Syria would require us to go to war
[2:00:52.620 --> 2:00:55.620]  Against Syria and Russia
[2:00:55.620 --> 2:00:58.620]  The US military has just raised the threat level
[2:00:58.620 --> 2:01:00.620]  To DEF CON 2
[2:01:00.620 --> 2:01:03.620]  Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton is still threatening Russia
[2:01:03.620 --> 2:01:04.620]  With military action
[2:01:04.620 --> 2:01:07.620]  Following unconfirmed reports of further hacking
[2:01:07.620 --> 2:01:10.620]  It's like she's not even concerned about the repercussions
[2:01:10.620 --> 2:01:11.620]  Of course not, because she's...
[2:01:11.620 --> 2:01:13.620]  Look, there's a really loud noise
[2:01:16.620 --> 2:01:18.620]  Alright, it looks like we're having a little bit of technical difficulties
[2:01:18.620 --> 2:01:21.620]  We'll try to get Leanne back on in a few minutes
[2:01:24.620 --> 2:01:27.620]  When the president gives the order
[2:01:27.620 --> 2:01:34.620]  It must be followed
[2:01:57.620 --> 2:02:00.620]  I would love to have me arrested and killed
[2:02:00.620 --> 2:02:01.620]  Guaranteed
[2:02:05.620 --> 2:02:08.620]  I am here because there is a concerted effort
[2:02:08.620 --> 2:02:11.620]  By the Democratic Party and multinational corporations in Big Tech
[2:02:11.620 --> 2:02:14.620]  To silence conservative and nationalist and populist voices
[2:02:14.620 --> 2:02:17.620]  Infowars founder Alex Jones is calling out alleged collusion
[2:02:17.620 --> 2:02:19.620]  Between Google and Democrats
[2:02:19.620 --> 2:02:22.620]  Son, you know Google is helping China with Dragonfly
[2:02:22.620 --> 2:02:25.620]  And you know that they're helping Sensor
[2:02:25.620 --> 2:02:27.620]  You know that you've sold this country out
[2:02:27.620 --> 2:02:29.620]  And you won't even help the Pentagon, you'll help the Chicoms
[2:02:29.620 --> 2:02:31.620]  You bet on the wrong country, Sundar
[2:02:31.620 --> 2:02:33.620]  We're aware of his lying to Congress
[2:02:33.620 --> 2:02:35.620]  We're aware of him and the Dragonfly project
[2:02:35.620 --> 2:02:37.620]  That's already been operational for years inside the Chinese government
[2:02:37.620 --> 2:02:39.620]  Now it's just being rolled out to the general public
[2:02:39.620 --> 2:02:41.620]  Sundar, you're engaged in treason
[2:02:41.620 --> 2:02:43.620]  You've had Google executives lie to Congress
[2:02:43.620 --> 2:02:45.620]  You're not sensory conservatives
[2:02:45.620 --> 2:02:47.620]  The Big Tech companies and the head of Apple admit
[2:02:47.620 --> 2:02:49.620]  That they met with Senator Warner
[2:02:49.620 --> 2:02:51.620]  Who's running this whole thing
[2:02:51.620 --> 2:02:53.620]  To begin shutting down conservatives
[2:02:53.620 --> 2:02:55.620]  Or the Democrats threatened to federalize
[2:02:55.620 --> 2:02:57.620]  Big Tech if they did not basically roll over to them
[2:02:57.620 --> 2:03:00.620]  I know we had Alex Jones in the room earlier
[2:03:00.620 --> 2:03:02.620]  Promoting conspiracy theories
[2:03:02.620 --> 2:03:05.620]  Alex Jones obviously is the one that's a conspiracy theorist
[2:03:05.620 --> 2:03:07.620]  Whose brand is bullying
[2:03:07.620 --> 2:03:09.620]  You didn't call me to testify in America
[2:03:09.620 --> 2:03:11.620]  I have a right to fix my accusers
[2:03:11.620 --> 2:03:13.620]  And you, Congressman Deutsch, are a liar and a fraud
[2:03:13.620 --> 2:03:17.620]  Google is evil
[2:03:17.620 --> 2:03:20.620]  Twitter is planning to permanently suspend
[2:03:20.620 --> 2:03:23.620]  Alex Jones' personal account at InfoWars
[2:03:23.620 --> 2:03:26.620]  This comes after Twitter's CEO, Jack Dorsey
[2:03:26.620 --> 2:03:29.620]  Was on Capitol Hill yesterday speaking with lawmakers
[2:03:29.620 --> 2:03:31.620]  Twitter gives Alex Jones the boot
[2:03:31.620 --> 2:03:34.620]  To the social networking site permanently banning
[2:03:34.620 --> 2:03:37.620]  He and his media company InfoWars
[2:03:37.620 --> 2:03:39.620]  Hey, Jack, I appreciate you being here
[2:03:39.620 --> 2:03:41.620]  But I have a right to fix my accusers, Jack
[2:03:41.620 --> 2:03:44.620]  They're lying about me and they're trying to de-platform me
[2:03:44.620 --> 2:03:46.620]  26 companies working in concert, violating
[2:03:46.620 --> 2:03:47.620]  The Sherman & E. Trust Act
[2:03:47.620 --> 2:03:50.620]  And now Senator Warner and Senator Wyden have said
[2:03:50.620 --> 2:03:52.620]  Quote, there's thousands of sites worse than Alex Jones
[2:03:52.620 --> 2:03:54.620]  So we're becoming like Cuba
[2:03:54.620 --> 2:03:55.620]  We're becoming like Vietnam
[2:03:55.620 --> 2:03:56.620]  We're becoming like China
[2:03:56.620 --> 2:03:59.620]  So regardless of what we'll think about me or the straw men
[2:03:59.620 --> 2:04:01.620]  Should I have a First Amendment
[2:04:01.620 --> 2:04:03.620]  Or should these companies be able to violate
[2:04:03.620 --> 2:04:05.620]  The whole Safe Arbor Act and all that
[2:04:05.620 --> 2:04:07.620]  And then ban conservatives en masse
[2:04:07.620 --> 2:04:09.620]  I don't know anything about your site, man
[2:04:09.620 --> 2:04:14.620]  And we're also standing up to social media censorship
[2:04:14.620 --> 2:04:15.620]  That's the new thing
[2:04:15.620 --> 2:04:17.620]  Our interview was cut short
[2:04:17.620 --> 2:04:19.620]  Because he was confronted by Alex Jones
[2:04:19.620 --> 2:04:21.620]  Of InfoWars right here in the hallway
[2:04:21.620 --> 2:04:22.620]  This is weird, man
[2:04:22.620 --> 2:04:23.620]  Oh, yeah, it's really weird
[2:04:23.620 --> 2:04:24.620]  There's no purge of conservatives
[2:04:24.620 --> 2:04:26.620]  Are you shadow banning?
[2:04:26.620 --> 2:04:28.620]  Are you concerned about bias in social media?
[2:04:28.620 --> 2:04:29.620]  Yeah, who's this guy?
[2:04:29.620 --> 2:04:31.620]  Are you concerned about bias in social media?
[2:04:31.620 --> 2:04:33.620]  Well, I think the bigger bias is against
[2:04:33.620 --> 2:04:34.620]  Freedom of expression
[2:04:34.620 --> 2:04:35.620]  Everybody should be...
[2:04:35.620 --> 2:04:36.620]  There's a...
[2:04:36.620 --> 2:04:38.620]  Look, I support going after...
[2:04:38.620 --> 2:04:39.620]  It's happening here, but you say I don't exist
[2:04:39.620 --> 2:04:40.620]  Is that a heckler?
[2:04:40.620 --> 2:04:41.620]  I'd oppress a gaggle
[2:04:41.620 --> 2:04:43.620]  Look at this guy, he's saying that I don't exist
[2:04:43.620 --> 2:04:45.620]  I just don't know who you are, man
[2:04:45.620 --> 2:04:46.620]  I don't read weird websites
[2:04:46.620 --> 2:04:48.620]  Sure, and they demonize me and these very hearing
[2:04:48.620 --> 2:05:14.620]  And then he plays Jones
[2:05:14.620 --> 2:05:18.620]  So we have air filters at infowarsstore.com
[2:05:18.620 --> 2:05:20.620]  The Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now

[2:05:29.620 --> 2:05:30.620]  Of these left right now
[2:05:30.620 --> 2:05:32.620]  We're basically selling these at cost
[2:05:32.620 --> 2:05:34.620]  Because there was a big overhaul
[2:05:34.620 --> 2:05:36.620]  Go ahead and read the hundreds
[2:05:36.620 --> 2:05:38.620]  Of five-star reviews for yourself
[2:05:38.620 --> 2:05:40.620]  I've got two in my home
[2:05:40.620 --> 2:05:42.620]  You will notice the difference
[2:05:42.620 --> 2:05:44.620]  Ladies and gentlemen
[2:05:44.620 --> 2:05:46.620]  With the Alexa Pure Breeze in your house
[2:05:46.620 --> 2:05:50.620]  Don't live in a polluted major city
[2:05:50.620 --> 2:05:52.620]  In your home, have clean air
[2:05:52.620 --> 2:06:14.620]  Go to infowarsstore.com
[2:06:22.620 --> 2:06:29.620]  Dangerous individuals
[2:06:29.620 --> 2:06:33.620]  Basically they've deemed these individuals to be dangerous
[2:06:33.620 --> 2:06:35.620]  They call me dangerous
[2:06:35.620 --> 2:06:37.620]  Danger is my middle name
[2:06:37.620 --> 2:06:39.620]  Dangerous like hurting other people
[2:06:39.620 --> 2:06:42.620]  Or dangerous as in saying things that Mark Zuckerberg doesn't like
[2:06:42.620 --> 2:06:45.620]  This is about the total rollout
[2:06:45.620 --> 2:06:47.620]  For complete and total censorship
[2:06:47.620 --> 2:06:48.620]  How dangerous is infowars?
[2:06:48.620 --> 2:06:50.620]  What is the difference at this point
[2:06:50.620 --> 2:06:53.620]  Between Trump's Twitter feed and infowars.com
[2:06:53.620 --> 2:06:56.620]  Infowars tells viewers that the world is out to get them
[2:06:56.620 --> 2:06:58.620]  None of this seems to repel President Trump
[2:06:58.620 --> 2:07:00.620]  Infowars content is useful to him
[2:07:00.620 --> 2:07:03.620]  Infowars personalities align with him
[2:07:03.620 --> 2:07:04.620]  I want them shut down
[2:07:04.620 --> 2:07:05.620]  I want them silenced
[2:07:05.620 --> 2:07:06.620]  I want them muted
[2:07:06.620 --> 2:07:08.620]  I think they are horrible for our society
[2:07:08.620 --> 2:07:10.620]  I want them shut down
[2:07:10.620 --> 2:07:11.620]  I want them silenced
[2:07:11.620 --> 2:07:12.620]  I want them muted
[2:07:12.620 --> 2:07:16.620]  Because these corporations are controlled by a liberal view
[2:07:16.620 --> 2:07:18.620]  We're very focused on making sure
[2:07:18.620 --> 2:07:20.620]  The recommendations and discovery surfaces
[2:07:20.620 --> 2:07:22.620]  Aren't highlighting groups
[2:07:22.620 --> 2:07:24.620]  Where people are repeatedly sharing misinformation
[2:07:24.620 --> 2:07:25.620]  Or harmful content
[2:07:25.620 --> 2:07:28.620]  And we're working hard to completely remove groups
[2:07:28.620 --> 2:07:32.620]  If they exist primarily to violate our policies
[2:07:32.620 --> 2:07:34.620]  Or do things that are dangerous
[2:07:34.620 --> 2:07:35.620]  Screw your rules
[2:07:35.620 --> 2:07:37.620]  Your rules go against our values
[2:07:37.620 --> 2:07:39.620]  And they are patently un-American
[2:07:39.620 --> 2:07:41.620]  Mark Zuckerberg is not simply censoring opinions
[2:07:41.620 --> 2:07:44.620]  He's prescribing which political opinions
[2:07:44.620 --> 2:07:46.620]  You're allowed to have
[2:07:46.620 --> 2:07:48.620]  We need a digital fill of rights
[2:07:48.620 --> 2:07:50.620]  They're becoming the public square
[2:07:50.620 --> 2:07:52.620]  And they control how we interact with each other
[2:07:52.620 --> 2:07:55.620]  And if you think that you are going to throw up your hands
[2:07:55.620 --> 2:07:56.620]  And say, well, they're private companies
[2:07:56.620 --> 2:07:58.620]  You are absolutely insane
[2:07:58.620 --> 2:07:59.620]  And you are part of the problem
[2:07:59.620 --> 2:08:00.620]  You are a bad person
[2:08:00.620 --> 2:08:02.620]  You should be censored off the internet
[2:08:02.620 --> 2:08:03.620]  Bad, yes
[2:08:03.620 --> 2:08:04.620]  But get out of here, Alex
[2:08:04.620 --> 2:08:06.620]  Infowars might have been banned from Twitter
[2:08:06.620 --> 2:08:08.620]  But it seems to have found a new home
[2:08:08.620 --> 2:08:09.620]  Over at Trump's Twitter feed
[2:08:09.620 --> 2:08:11.620]  President Trump's furious reaction
[2:08:11.620 --> 2:08:12.620]  To Facebook's action
[2:08:12.620 --> 2:08:14.620]  Showcases that he is
[2:08:14.620 --> 2:08:16.620]  I'm sorry to say
[2:08:16.620 --> 2:08:18.620]  But Infowars president
[2:08:18.620 --> 2:08:19.620]  Infowars
[2:08:19.620 --> 2:08:23.620]  The most banned network in the world
[2:08:23.620 --> 2:08:25.620]  How dangerous is it, bro?
[2:08:25.620 --> 2:08:26.620]  Austin, Texas
[2:08:26.620 --> 2:08:28.620]  Broadcasting worldwide
[2:08:28.620 --> 2:08:30.620]  It's Alex Jones
[2:08:37.620 --> 2:08:39.620]  So, we played this clip yesterday
[2:08:39.620 --> 2:08:41.620]  There's actually five or six of these
[2:08:41.620 --> 2:08:44.620]  Caitlyn Bennett was in Ohio
[2:08:44.620 --> 2:08:46.620]  At the Gay Pride Parade
[2:08:46.620 --> 2:08:48.620]  And then Millie Weaver was in
[2:08:48.620 --> 2:08:49.620]  I think the Pittsburgh one
[2:08:49.620 --> 2:08:51.620]  She'll correct me if I'm wrong
[2:08:51.620 --> 2:08:54.620]  And she went as Rainbow Snatch, though
[2:08:54.620 --> 2:08:55.620]  And a lot of the folks said
[2:08:55.620 --> 2:08:58.620]  We want to ban the straight Pride Parade
[2:09:00.620 --> 2:09:01.620]  Now, my issue is
[2:09:01.620 --> 2:09:04.620]  It's more like a street gang
[2:09:04.620 --> 2:09:07.620]  And it's more like people that had theater degrees
[2:09:07.620 --> 2:09:09.620]  But never get a job
[2:09:09.620 --> 2:09:11.620]  I'm not sure these are gay people, actually
[2:09:11.620 --> 2:09:14.620]  But you watch these gay Pride Parades
[2:09:14.620 --> 2:09:17.620]  And they don't sound too inclusive
[2:09:17.620 --> 2:09:19.620]  But they say that they've been so persecuted
[2:09:19.620 --> 2:09:21.620]  By America
[2:09:21.620 --> 2:09:23.620]  We're always in love with Islam, though
[2:09:23.620 --> 2:09:27.620]  Oh, it's wonderful throwing you off buildings
[2:09:27.620 --> 2:09:31.620]  But America's so bad
[2:09:31.620 --> 2:09:33.620]  But if you don't go in disguise
[2:09:33.620 --> 2:09:36.620]  In a rainbow unicorn outfit
[2:09:36.620 --> 2:09:38.620]  Then you get attacked
[2:09:38.620 --> 2:09:41.620]  Like Caitlyn Bennett did
[2:09:41.620 --> 2:09:43.620]  But listening to these folks, they keep saying
[2:09:43.620 --> 2:09:47.620]  Our religion is our sexuality
[2:09:47.620 --> 2:09:48.620]  And see, that's it
[2:09:48.620 --> 2:09:49.620]  We've gotten rid of Christianity
[2:09:49.620 --> 2:09:50.620]  We've got rid of other religions
[2:09:50.620 --> 2:09:52.620]  But like a vacuum in comes
[2:09:52.620 --> 2:09:58.620]  The religion that you don't have children
[2:09:58.620 --> 2:10:00.620]  Now, sure, CPS goes out
[2:10:00.620 --> 2:10:01.620]  And takes other people's children
[2:10:01.620 --> 2:10:05.620]  And you get those
[2:10:05.620 --> 2:10:07.620]  You harvest children
[2:10:07.620 --> 2:10:08.620]  But at the end of the day
[2:10:08.620 --> 2:10:10.620]  It reduces population
[2:10:10.620 --> 2:10:13.620]  And that's why the system sells it
[2:10:13.620 --> 2:10:17.620]  That's why it pushes it
[2:10:17.620 --> 2:10:20.620]  So there's all these videos
[2:10:20.620 --> 2:10:22.620]  Of Millie and Caitlyn Bennett being attacked
[2:10:22.620 --> 2:10:24.620]  Being physically attacked
[2:10:24.620 --> 2:10:26.620]  We're showing it if you're a TV viewer
[2:10:26.620 --> 2:10:30.620]  Radio listeners can't see this right now
[2:10:30.620 --> 2:10:32.620]  And I've never seen groups so violent
[2:10:32.620 --> 2:10:33.620]  And so protected
[2:10:33.620 --> 2:10:35.620]  And the police coming over and saying
[2:10:35.620 --> 2:10:37.620]  They are protected, they are allowed
[2:10:37.620 --> 2:10:39.620]  To hit you in the city street
[2:10:39.620 --> 2:10:42.620]  They are God
[2:10:42.620 --> 2:10:43.620]  But didn't they say
[2:10:43.620 --> 2:10:45.620]  But no straight people are being assaulted
[2:10:45.620 --> 2:10:47.620]  No, there's no Trump supporters
[2:10:47.620 --> 2:10:48.620]  Being hit with bike locks
[2:10:48.620 --> 2:10:50.620]  There's no attacks
[2:10:50.620 --> 2:10:52.620]  I have a stack of articles where lesbians
[2:10:52.620 --> 2:10:55.620]  Now in Europe, in Latin America, in the U.S.
[2:10:55.620 --> 2:10:58.620]  Adopt boys and chop their genitals off
[2:10:58.620 --> 2:11:00.620]  In a ritual
[2:11:00.620 --> 2:11:02.620]  That the male genitals are bad
[2:11:02.620 --> 2:11:04.620]  Actually, mainstream news
[2:11:04.620 --> 2:11:06.620]  On newswords.com, m4s.com
[2:11:06.620 --> 2:11:07.620]  You can't make this up
[2:11:07.620 --> 2:11:08.620]  So there it is
[2:11:08.620 --> 2:11:11.620]  Lesbians stab innocent nine-year-old son to death
[2:11:11.620 --> 2:11:13.620]  After trying to make him transgender
[2:11:13.620 --> 2:11:15.620]  By cutting off his genitals a year before
[2:11:15.620 --> 2:11:18.620]  He complained about having his genitals
[2:11:18.620 --> 2:11:21.620]  His testicles and penis cut off with scissors
[2:11:21.620 --> 2:11:23.620]  So his mother stabbed him to death
[2:11:23.620 --> 2:11:25.620]  As he begged mommy, please don't kill me
[2:11:25.620 --> 2:11:27.620]  And they said die homophobe
[2:11:27.620 --> 2:11:29.620]  Plunging
[2:11:29.620 --> 2:11:31.620]  This is actually in the police report
[2:11:31.620 --> 2:11:34.620]  Die, die, die!
[2:11:34.620 --> 2:11:39.620]  It's liberal, though
[2:11:39.620 --> 2:11:40.620]  You'd understand
[2:11:40.620 --> 2:11:43.620]  It's all liberal
[2:11:45.620 --> 2:11:47.620]  So, I haven't even gotten to
[2:11:47.620 --> 2:11:49.620]  When I brought this evening crown er yesterday
[2:11:49.620 --> 2:11:52.620]  The space salient, the interviewed Sundar Pichai
[2:11:52.620 --> 2:11:54.620]  We're gonna get to that
[2:11:54.620 --> 2:11:56.620]  You know, no one's a mean from comedy
[2:11:56.620 --> 2:11:57.620]  And let me tell you
[2:11:57.620 --> 2:12:00.620]  Crazy dudes saying he's a girl in cat lady glasses
[2:12:00.620 --> 2:12:02.620]  It's the call for censorship
[2:12:03.620 --> 2:12:09.460]  I'm convinced if Hitler was like said he was a woman war pink. I've said this before and we're cat lady glasses
[2:12:09.460 --> 2:12:13.540]  We would just give it up. He's like well. We can't fight back. He's wearing cat lady glasses
[2:12:14.540 --> 2:12:19.300]  Or well, you know Hitler cut his testicles off. Oh, well then by well, you've got to do what he says then
[2:12:19.300 --> 2:12:24.740]  You know like we'll get rid of the free speech if Hitler said cut our balls off then, you know, it's like if he did it
[2:12:24.740 --> 2:12:26.580]  We've got to do it
[2:12:26.580 --> 2:12:31.220]  So that's all coming up. But here is a Caitlyn Bennett being physically
[2:12:33.340 --> 2:12:37.900]  Assaulted they come over to her they run over and attack her Mendo
[2:12:37.900 --> 2:12:40.940]  And then another man comes over and defends them and they run off
[2:12:40.940 --> 2:12:43.660]  But I mean these are real tough guys and they weren't again
[2:12:44.420 --> 2:12:45.860]  mayor
[2:12:45.860 --> 2:12:47.860]  Buddha judges event here it is
[2:12:51.860 --> 2:12:53.860]  Hi, how are you?
[2:12:53.860 --> 2:12:57.460]  Good pause for a minute. Do you let's start this over?
[2:12:58.340 --> 2:13:00.340]  so imagine
[2:13:00.900 --> 2:13:04.800]  Imagine this if you're a TV viewer you see it real listener. She's in a field
[2:13:06.980 --> 2:13:12.820]  Other people are 50 yards away you can see right there she gets there early
[2:13:13.780 --> 2:13:15.020]  mayor
[2:13:15.020 --> 2:13:17.020]  Booty plug or whatever his name is hasn't shown up
[2:13:17.020 --> 2:13:23.020]  Anti-free speech whatever his name is his boyfriend or whatever talks about, you know, loving of all ages and
[2:13:25.100 --> 2:13:29.380]  Dudes come over to mess with her because I guess she's a woman
[2:13:30.740 --> 2:13:34.900]  So they come over to henpeck her they're like, oh, yeah, we won't we're gonna do this to her
[2:13:34.900 --> 2:13:40.820]  And then they say get out of our face that doesn't think about the running to get get away from us stop assaulting us again
[2:13:40.820 --> 2:13:42.820]  It's all fraud all on video
[2:13:42.820 --> 2:13:49.180]  But it's okay because it doesn't matter Apple owned slave fighters in China Tim Cook's gay
[2:13:49.900 --> 2:13:54.720]  Doesn't matter that Buddha judge has his people attacking folks. He's it's okay
[2:13:56.220 --> 2:14:03.900]  He has sex with men and that's to get out of jail free card. That's like magic. That's that's the the the standard is like
[2:14:03.900 --> 2:14:05.700]  It's such an accomplishment
[2:14:05.700 --> 2:14:08.580]  You know, we're a rainbow cape have sex with men
[2:14:08.580 --> 2:14:14.820]  Man, I was like, you know, I had sex with my wife this morning. Yeah, I'm really cool. You know
[2:14:15.780 --> 2:14:18.860]  Do what I say. I have sex with women. I
[2:14:20.020 --> 2:14:23.940]  Mean, that's the level of cuckoo for cocoa puffs. We've got
[2:14:25.780 --> 2:14:30.140]  Where it's like Kevin Spacey has sex with oh my god, that is so amazing
[2:14:30.140 --> 2:14:34.420]  I know it takes a lot to do and it's like it's like climbing Mount Everest, you know
[2:14:34.420 --> 2:14:39.060]  The gay guys, you know, they go in the bathroom the glory holes. They have sex like two dudes a day
[2:14:39.060 --> 2:14:44.740]  It's like really in the car. Oh my god. It's so brave to oh, I know they're so oppressed right now in America
[2:14:44.740 --> 2:14:50.860]  That's why they love Muslims though and there's these weird videos of like the thing that's talking to Sundar Pachai
[2:14:51.100 --> 2:14:53.740]  Who's like laughing at the creature going?
[2:14:54.580 --> 2:14:59.500]  The pink right wing is a means of the Muslims and Sundar knows 140 million
[2:14:59.500 --> 2:15:06.660]  Hindus got killed by Muslims, but he's still like sitting there talking to a dude in a pink shirt with cat-letting glasses on
[2:15:08.100 --> 2:15:10.760]  Who doesn't even try to like have a girl's voice. He's like rare
[2:15:11.700 --> 2:15:17.620]  Sundar, how are you doing? Good to see you today? You're not censoring another son. I was like, don't worry
[2:15:17.660 --> 2:15:19.660]  We're gonna censor even more now
[2:15:19.940 --> 2:15:21.940]  So when I come back, we'll go to Millie Weaver
[2:15:22.340 --> 2:15:25.420]  You know, I had Zimmerman coming on but I'm not sure he's got work to do
[2:15:25.500 --> 2:15:27.500]  We're not even sure if he'll be on now
[2:15:27.500 --> 2:15:30.620]  But it's all just a fun house a
[2:15:31.060 --> 2:15:37.340]  Charnell house a mad house of insanity when we return women being assaulted by men
[2:15:38.580 --> 2:15:40.260]  But it's okay

[2:21:02.300 --> 2:21:04.300]  Hey, very cool
[2:21:04.940 --> 2:21:06.940]  He walked up to you
[2:21:06.980 --> 2:21:11.580]  What are you gonna do to me walk up to me? Do not walk up to me like that again
[2:21:12.900 --> 2:21:14.900]  Hey
[2:21:14.900 --> 2:21:16.900]  No
[2:21:21.020 --> 2:21:23.020]  You're walking right you walked up
[2:21:28.500 --> 2:21:31.580]  You treat women like that walk it off
[2:21:33.060 --> 2:21:36.820]  Walk it off. Okay. Walk it off bro. Walk it off
[2:21:36.820 --> 2:21:45.260]  So you made a good point all right folks, we're back live here and this is a video of just a day and a half ago
[2:21:46.300 --> 2:21:51.220]  Katelyn been it being attacked and I've got hundreds of stories here and literally dozens of videos that are incredible
[2:21:51.220 --> 2:21:58.100]  But I air this again because almost every video you guys turn in now unless you're undercover like you were I believe we were this week
[2:21:59.220 --> 2:22:01.220]  As rainbow snatch
[2:22:01.740 --> 2:22:03.740]  You're getting physically a chance
[2:22:03.740 --> 2:22:10.420]  Rainbow snatch you're getting physically attacked by these people and then they say but no lgbt
[2:22:11.060 --> 2:22:13.060]  T
[2:22:14.460 --> 2:22:19.220]  You know person would ever attack anybody else and they keep saying lgbt
[2:22:20.020 --> 2:22:25.700]  Deserves to exist and you'll have their their rallies. Okay, fine, but conservatives shouldn't have a
[2:22:26.300 --> 2:22:28.500]  Straight pride parade because they'd ever been persecuted
[2:22:28.500 --> 2:22:34.620]  But meanwhile the left is physically attacking everyone over and over and over again. Mellie. What's going on here?
[2:22:38.220 --> 2:22:45.020]  In their hostility that video of Katelyn and her camera guy Michael being assaulted just boils my blood
[2:22:45.220 --> 2:22:50.060]  Because if anyone who knows Michael knows he's the most like innocent happy-go-lucky
[2:22:51.020 --> 2:22:57.860]  Mild-mannered guy and that guy totally came up and whacked him in the head with a full it looked like a full water bottle
[2:22:57.860 --> 2:23:05.720]  And it's just horrible. It's bullying the left have become bullies to anyone that doesn't conform to their progressive
[2:23:05.980 --> 2:23:12.780]  Ideology, that's why I had to go as rainbow snatch to just simply get true honest interviews
[2:23:12.980 --> 2:23:19.260]  About what these leftists actually think otherwise. I would be just like Caitlyn. I would be mobbed at these events
[2:23:20.140 --> 2:23:22.140]  It's it's disgusting
[2:23:22.140 --> 2:23:29.580]  But yet at the same time they constantly preach tolerance. They want all this tolerance from the left yet at the same time
[2:23:29.620 --> 2:23:34.100]  They're the most intolerant people imaginable even at the Pittsburgh pride
[2:23:34.340 --> 2:23:41.020]  There were three a total of three Christian preachers on the street, you know, essentially
[2:23:41.660 --> 2:23:43.460]  protesting them and
[2:23:43.460 --> 2:23:45.460]  One of the attendees of the Pride March
[2:23:46.300 --> 2:23:51.060]  Assaulted the preacher. I mean there were only three of the the protesters yet
[2:23:51.060 --> 2:23:54.140]  They can't just let the three people protest
[2:23:54.140 --> 2:23:59.100]  I mean, this is what America's about who cares if someone wants to be on the street yelling by the way Millie
[2:23:59.100 --> 2:24:03.420]  We're gonna play that next segment. I forgot. I'm glad you mentioned. That's why I'm saying there's too much news here
[2:24:03.740 --> 2:24:08.460]  You're there covering it. There's three street preachers. There's thousands of people at the gay pride parade
[2:24:09.780 --> 2:24:15.180]  That I'm sorry on average. They look like day of the dead. It was very sad and very very
[2:24:15.900 --> 2:24:17.900]  Barely walking like stumbling around
[2:24:17.900 --> 2:24:23.220]  Wow, it's very very sad, but you've got three little street preachers. They're physically attacking them
[2:24:23.900 --> 2:24:25.900]  And so you got that amazing footage as well
[2:24:25.900 --> 2:24:30.900]  Oh, yeah, I mean the young guy that attacked the street preacher the preacher
[2:24:30.900 --> 2:24:32.260]  It's hard to see it in the video
[2:24:32.260 --> 2:24:38.740]  But the preacher restrains him and kind of puts them in a chokehold and then the police rush in and they arrest the guy
[2:24:38.740 --> 2:24:44.340]  Because the guy came up and threw like a coke can a full coke can that was open at the guy
[2:24:44.340 --> 2:24:48.540]  That could really mess you up if you put your right, you know, exactly
[2:24:48.540 --> 2:24:52.900]  You've also got a Satanist on video that resembles a giant obese chipmunk
[2:24:52.900 --> 2:24:56.780]  I mean the guy his teeth was we're running out. He looks like a big
[2:24:56.780 --> 2:25:01.260]  Let me tell you Satanist always look like vampire bats whether it's Kim Jong-un or this guy
[2:25:01.260 --> 2:25:04.380]  They always the nose is always upturned. That was a little rotten teeth
[2:25:04.540 --> 2:25:05.820]  I'm not trying to be mean here
[2:25:05.820 --> 2:25:10.260]  But there's something about Satanist that they have that that giant obese chipmunk look. Oh
[2:25:10.260 --> 2:25:15.740]  I mean the guy just looks like a Satanist. It's what you would picture a Satanist to look like
[2:25:15.740 --> 2:25:18.380]  We know what he really looks like Billy. We're not gonna say it on air
[2:25:18.940 --> 2:25:20.940]  yeah, exactly right and
[2:25:22.380 --> 2:25:28.780]  Instantly this fight breaks out the guy gets arrested. I mean this video has gone viral so far on my YouTube channel
[2:25:28.780 --> 2:25:31.580]  it's almost a 300,000 views already and
[2:25:32.380 --> 2:25:34.460]  You don't hear the mainstream media talking about it
[2:25:34.460 --> 2:25:42.460]  But guaranteed if it was you know a gay person out there protesting a straight pride parade that got attacked by one of the attendees
[2:25:42.460 --> 2:25:45.140]  The media would be running with it. No, let's be clear
[2:25:45.140 --> 2:25:51.460]  There there are all sorts of people that like the same sex that have regular jobs and are professional and are normal
[2:25:52.620 --> 2:25:54.620]  That's that's known. I'm not against anybody
[2:25:55.340 --> 2:26:00.340]  But you these parades I've covered of you covered him. It is a freak show man
[2:26:00.340 --> 2:26:07.740]  I mean, this is like the legion of doom a mental institution got let out and the media just promote
[2:26:07.740 --> 2:26:12.980]  And then like there's usually a little like like you got video and sort of half naked little kids dancing and stuff
[2:26:12.980 --> 2:26:20.100]  We won't even show on TV. We're on TV stations. We can't show this if adult shows can't show it
[2:26:20.100 --> 2:26:22.100]  How are kids involved?
[2:26:22.580 --> 2:26:28.980]  You have people using profanity dancing around very sexual men in Speedos, you know
[2:26:28.980 --> 2:26:32.700]  Dry humping the air you've got like you've got literally
[2:26:33.300 --> 2:26:38.500]  Women walking around in nothing, but pasties yet there are we're so many children there
[2:26:38.500 --> 2:26:43.220]  And we haven't even released that footage yet of all the children. I mean people are bringing their kids to these things
[2:26:43.220 --> 2:26:48.220]  Yeah, cuz I you and I agree. I don't think we should I mean at a certain point. I want to show this
[2:26:48.900 --> 2:26:51.260]  But it's it's it's like it's so obscene
[2:26:51.940 --> 2:26:57.460]  Like watching it makes me feel like dirty and bad. Oh my god. How do they take their kids to this?
[2:26:57.460 --> 2:27:03.180]  So I saw some people walking and it looked like some mascots dressed in animal suits
[2:27:03.180 --> 2:27:06.620]  And one guy was a fish mascot and he was walking in this parade
[2:27:06.620 --> 2:27:12.780]  So I went up to go interview him and ask him a question and some lady came up who looked like she was in a zookeeper or aquarium
[2:27:12.900 --> 2:27:15.540]  Keeper outfit and said um, he doesn't talk
[2:27:15.540 --> 2:27:22.420]  He's a fish like as though I should have known you know that this guy can't talk because he's apparently a fish
[2:27:22.420 --> 2:27:28.860]  And we all have to abide by that this man really believes he's a fish. You miss gendered. Well, California has laws
[2:27:28.860 --> 2:27:34.460]  Do you miss gender you miss gendered? He was a defect. Well, that's what did you ask? What is the type of fish?
[2:27:35.420 --> 2:27:42.500]  You know, I did not ask that. I'm sure she probably told me. I don't remember there were furries there people, you know
[2:27:42.500 --> 2:27:48.980]  Pops furries apparently there's a difference between people think they're dogs and I mean, so this is basically a mental institutions gotten lush
[2:27:48.980 --> 2:27:56.100]  What's up with really ugly dudes it was like he dresses clowns everywhere
[2:27:57.300 --> 2:28:02.180]  Yeah, I mean it was hard to tell if they were dudes or she dudes or what they were
[2:28:02.460 --> 2:28:08.460]  But yes, they're dressed really bizarre. I mean it looks like a circus
[2:28:08.460 --> 2:28:14.300]  It looks like we don't need to go to the circus to see the bearded fat woman anymore. They're just parading down the street
[2:28:14.300 --> 2:28:20.020]  It's saying that they're oppressed yet. There's only three people showing up to protest these tens of thousands of these people
[2:28:21.140 --> 2:28:23.140]  And I mean look at some of these people
[2:28:24.020 --> 2:28:31.860]  You know these people say they don't think that straight people should be allowed to have a straight pride parade because straight people aren't oppressed enough
[2:28:32.020 --> 2:28:34.020]  Since when meanwhile
[2:28:34.620 --> 2:28:40.380]  Public schools they don't ask these guys come in and your kids sit on their laps. I think we're there

[2:33:01.820 --> 2:33:03.820]  Oh
[2:33:14.780 --> 2:33:18.140]  Well, my daddy left home when I was three and he didn't leave much
[2:33:18.460 --> 2:33:22.300]  Tomorrow and me just this old guitar and an empty bottle of boo
[2:33:24.300 --> 2:33:26.620]  Now I don't blame him because he's running ahead
[2:33:26.620 --> 2:33:32.060]  But the meanest thing that he ever did was before he left. He went and named me sue
[2:33:34.780 --> 2:33:39.420]  Well, he must have thought that it was quite a joke and it got a lot of laughs from a lots of folks
[2:33:39.980 --> 2:33:42.700]  Seems I had to fight my whole life through
[2:33:44.300 --> 2:33:52.060]  Some gal would giggle and I'd get rid and some guy'd laugh and I'd bust his head. I'll tell you life ain't easy for a boy named sue
[2:33:52.060 --> 2:34:00.620]  Well, I grew up quick and I grew up mean my fist got hard and my wits got keen
[2:34:01.100 --> 2:34:03.980]  Roam from town to town to hide my shame
[2:34:05.340 --> 2:34:12.860]  But I made me a vow to the moon and stars I'd search the home from Thompson bars and kill that man and give me that awful name
[2:34:14.620 --> 2:34:19.580]  Well, it was Gatlinburg in mid-July and I just hit town and my throat was dry
[2:34:19.580 --> 2:34:22.620]  I thought I'd stop and have myself a groove
[2:34:24.220 --> 2:34:31.820]  Had an old saloon on the street of mud there at a table dealing stud such a dirty man's you dog could name me sue
[2:34:33.500 --> 2:34:38.060]  Well, I knew that snake was my own sweet dad from a worn out picture that my mother'd had
[2:34:38.460 --> 2:34:41.180]  And I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye
[2:34:41.740 --> 2:34:48.220]  He said he was big and fancy gray and old and I lifted him and my blood ran cold and I said
[2:34:48.220 --> 2:34:50.220]  My name is sue
[2:34:50.460 --> 2:34:53.820]  How do you do now you gonna die?
[2:34:57.260 --> 2:35:03.740]  All right, that's another story to finish up here get that off the screen god almighty a to governor Gavin Newsom
[2:35:05.100 --> 2:35:10.860]  32 dies of natural causes kind of like that intern got her brains back stand over at
[2:35:13.260 --> 2:35:15.260]  Scarborough's office
[2:35:15.260 --> 2:35:17.260]  That's the story of the Sacramento B
[2:35:18.780 --> 2:35:23.740]  That's just a sad day for her, isn't it nice beautiful young girl like her
[2:35:25.900 --> 2:35:27.900]  She's dead now
[2:35:28.220 --> 2:35:31.580]  Old governor Newsom he just keeps sailing on
[2:35:33.500 --> 2:35:38.540]  All right, Millie I your full report is up on info wars.com and news wars.com
[2:35:38.540 --> 2:35:45.500]  I forget the exact name of it, but it's incredible because they say our sex is our religion and that really is it's been replaced
[2:35:45.500 --> 2:35:48.460]  So they're promoting their religion sure like what can people have a
[2:35:49.180 --> 2:35:52.620]  A straight pride parade there. Oh, no, you haven't been abused like we have
[2:35:54.140 --> 2:36:00.220]  But Christians and conservatives are being bullied and attacked and probably in a Trump supporter out there
[2:36:00.540 --> 2:36:04.860]  Probably in an info or supporter you're getting bullied and attacked. I mean the laughter a bunch of bullies
[2:36:04.860 --> 2:36:06.860]  We just spent 30 minutes showing all the footage
[2:36:06.860 --> 2:36:15.340]  Yeah, I mean it's the prerequisite now in order to have a parade. You have to be oppressed. Well, sorry, but the lgbtq community
[2:36:15.340 --> 2:36:17.980]  Is not the oppressed community nowadays
[2:36:17.980 --> 2:36:25.020]  It's like all of the it's like in high school when they used to let, you know, the Asian group the black group the lgbtq group
[2:36:25.020 --> 2:36:28.780]  Like all these clubs exist except you're not allowed to have a white club at school
[2:36:29.020 --> 2:36:35.740]  It's like all these clubs decided to just now become one big group and now go to the
[2:36:35.740 --> 2:36:40.780]  group and now gang up against all the white kids in school or all the straight kids in school and
[2:36:40.940 --> 2:36:47.340]  Oh, you're not allowed to have a straight pride parade. Otherwise, that's racist. Well, how is that not discrimination?
[2:36:47.820 --> 2:36:50.860]  I mean telling the straight people they can't have a parade
[2:36:51.660 --> 2:36:55.820]  That that's discrimination on its own and now you have all of these celebrities
[2:36:56.220 --> 2:37:02.140]  Halsey the recording artist senior performer war assure on stage that after your straight pride
[2:37:02.220 --> 2:37:04.780]  Oh, it's absolutely like we're the bad guys. Yeah
[2:37:04.780 --> 2:37:12.060]  Yeah, I mean you have all these celebrities captain america, you know kiss chris evans came out against it
[2:37:12.540 --> 2:37:20.300]  All these people are coming out against it and attacking straight people for simply wanting to go out and you know, express their sexual orientation
[2:37:20.300 --> 2:37:22.940]  Because that's what this is. It's a domination
[2:37:23.500 --> 2:37:27.020]  And it's a political welding. They call it the broken coalition strategy
[2:37:27.340 --> 2:37:29.340]  We take a bunch of different little subgroups
[2:37:30.220 --> 2:37:32.220]  and
[2:37:32.220 --> 2:37:33.900]  Then you simply
[2:37:33.900 --> 2:37:36.620]  Claim they're all victims, but they all then vote in your coalition
[2:37:36.860 --> 2:37:40.460]  But the truth is if anybody's being victimized is traditional families
[2:37:40.700 --> 2:37:44.380]  Look at all these democratic groups saying families are bad. We should get rid of them
[2:37:45.340 --> 2:37:51.100]  Well, you know, some of the people I interviewed though at the pride to be fair said, well, you know, it's probably okay
[2:37:51.260 --> 2:37:54.140]  I'm not going to like stop them from having a straight pride parade
[2:37:54.380 --> 2:37:59.820]  But mind you that was before the mainstream media came out in mass and told everyone how to think
[2:37:59.820 --> 2:38:05.260]  And now said no the straight people shouldn't be allowed to have this parade. So I'm sure now the liberals and leftists
[2:38:05.660 --> 2:38:10.620]  Automatically group think they all think that, you know, straight pride shouldn't exist. That's how they work
[2:38:10.700 --> 2:38:14.060]  They're group think they're a bunch of conformists a bunch of npc
[2:38:14.700 --> 2:38:21.820]  Robots and that's why I had to go as rainbow snatch to the pride parade and man the results are hilarious
[2:38:22.300 --> 2:38:26.860]  I mean rainbow snatch really went out there and trolled these, you know
[2:38:26.860 --> 2:38:30.460]  These leftists because we are trying to expose
[2:38:30.940 --> 2:38:38.140]  The insanity and the ignorance in the left who cares, you know, what these people's sexual orientation is if somebody
[2:38:38.300 --> 2:38:42.620]  You know wants to love whoever they want to love, you know, who cares we don't care about that
[2:38:42.700 --> 2:38:49.660]  We care about the mind controlled insanity and ignorance that the left has succumbed to
[2:38:50.060 --> 2:38:56.060]  And they're trying to force all of these well exactly and they're organizing autistic and mentally retarded children in the schools
[2:38:56.060 --> 2:39:03.340]  That's in them. That's admitted to like be organized into these sex cults. So it's a perfect angle for pedophilia. It's very very dangerous
[2:39:03.420 --> 2:39:05.420]  getting back to governor
[2:39:05.980 --> 2:39:07.580]  Gavin Newsom
[2:39:07.580 --> 2:39:09.580]  32 year old aid dies
[2:39:10.620 --> 2:39:11.900]  um
[2:39:11.900 --> 2:39:19.900]  They say natural causes right as it's announced whenever you hear oh natural causes right away, you know, it's generally foul play
[2:39:19.900 --> 2:39:25.900]  And so they have, you know, less evidence with this couple who may be guilty
[2:39:26.540 --> 2:39:29.660]  Up in Connecticut killing his wife ex-wife or whatever
[2:39:30.380 --> 2:39:32.380]  Those people have been in jail
[2:39:32.700 --> 2:39:39.420]  And but this lady's murdered. We're told out of the gates. She's killed. She's dead. Don't worry about it
[2:39:40.140 --> 2:39:43.660]  Um, and it's natural causes that milley is very very suspicious
[2:39:43.660 --> 2:39:52.700]  We have milley skype having a problem. Um, let's let's because I would already do this. Let's hear a few minutes
[2:39:53.580 --> 2:39:55.340]  of her latest report
[2:39:55.340 --> 2:40:01.660]  Where she's out talking to these folks and most of them say some some are free speech that that's good of them
[2:40:01.900 --> 2:40:06.620]  How gracious some of the others are like no, you don't deserve to have a straight pride parade
[2:40:07.980 --> 2:40:10.300]  Why don't want to pray anyways about sex?
[2:40:10.300 --> 2:40:12.700]  But whatever here it is
[2:40:13.820 --> 2:40:16.700]  Would you guys go and be allies at their parade?
[2:40:18.460 --> 2:40:20.460]  What'd you say said hell no
[2:40:21.580 --> 2:40:25.340]  Info wars the most banned network in the world
[2:40:26.140 --> 2:40:29.420]  Have you heard about conservatives wanting to hold a straight
[2:40:30.060 --> 2:40:33.980]  Pride march? I'm not I've not heard of that. What do you think about that?
[2:40:33.980 --> 2:40:39.340]  I just have one question to respond
[2:40:40.220 --> 2:40:45.820]  When's the last time a straight couple has been assaulted in the streets for being straight?
[2:40:46.220 --> 2:40:48.220]  And I think that's all that needs to be said
[2:40:50.220 --> 2:40:55.500]  Pretty much the same they can have a straight pride in the way they want it as soon as their marriage is illegal
[2:40:56.220 --> 2:40:59.260]  And they're thrown out of their homes when it's found out they're straight
[2:40:59.900 --> 2:41:02.860]  As soon as they're beaten on the streets for being straight
[2:41:02.860 --> 2:41:04.860]  Uh
[2:41:05.980 --> 2:41:09.980]  A straight pride parade well, I think that's like having a way to
[2:41:10.940 --> 2:41:14.380]  Not really needed and kind of rude hit pause again. I'm sorry
[2:41:15.580 --> 2:41:17.580]  These people are gross man
[2:41:17.980 --> 2:41:19.980]  It isn't about who they're having sex with like
[2:41:21.980 --> 2:41:26.380]  Is that what gay people look like I thought they're all like in shape and stuff like what I mean like
[2:41:27.020 --> 2:41:28.860]  This is like a lunatic asylum
[2:41:28.860 --> 2:41:33.260]  If I saw people saying they're the straight pride parade and they all look like they've been
[2:41:33.820 --> 2:41:38.380]  Microwaved or something I'd be scared milly it goes on and on from there and they say everybody should be banned
[2:41:38.620 --> 2:41:41.180]  I can tell folks at ambient report where people can find it
[2:41:42.300 --> 2:41:46.700]  You can find it on info wars store.com or on youtube. The name of it is
[2:41:47.260 --> 2:41:51.260]  Uh, not an ally to straight pride parade. So lgbtq
[2:41:51.260 --> 2:41:59.580]  Do not an ally to straight pride parade. We also have a rainbow snatch undercover report where I essentially going in troll them
[2:41:59.580 --> 2:42:01.020]  All it's hilarious
[2:42:01.020 --> 2:42:06.860]  I get them all to say, you know whoo and cheer impeach trump and then I say yay mike penns for president
[2:42:07.420 --> 2:42:12.860]  They look all shocked and that's a great video where they have to admit. Oh wait pencil get in then they're against it
[2:42:13.420 --> 2:42:15.260]  Exactly so it's lb
[2:42:15.260 --> 2:42:17.820]  lgbtq not allies of straight pride
[2:42:17.820 --> 2:42:21.660]  I think it's a free video in four store.com's our sponsor, but uh, absolutely

[2:42:43.020 --> 2:42:47.180]  To get to all of this but since we're on this whole discussion

[2:47:01.820 --> 2:47:29.020]  Welcome back. I'm alex jones your host. I'm gonna host a little bit of the next hour as well with my catas and some other breaking news
[2:47:29.020 --> 2:47:34.380]  But right now michael zimmerman started here three or four years ago as a camera guy
[2:47:34.380 --> 2:47:38.300]  He's a great camera guy. He's a really good engineer an IT guy. I guess his dad is too
[2:47:39.660 --> 2:47:44.540]  And so he's been helping us comply with all of these lawsuits and discovery
[2:47:45.980 --> 2:47:47.740]  And you've got a
[2:47:47.740 --> 2:47:50.940]  former u.s. Attorney appointed by obama up in connecticut
[2:47:51.660 --> 2:47:54.060]  Who's running these these these dnc?
[2:47:54.780 --> 2:47:56.780]  We believe funded lawsuits
[2:47:56.780 --> 2:48:02.380]  And they just keep saying give us the marketing plan on sandy hook. Give us where all the money is
[2:48:02.940 --> 2:48:04.940]  Give me the money labowski
[2:48:05.180 --> 2:48:12.220]  And we're like we barely covered that like 15 times over the last seven years other than us being in the news and us countering it
[2:48:13.100 --> 2:48:19.740]  We understand that you democrats up there run on this you live off this you've sued the school dead teachers heroes
[2:48:20.540 --> 2:48:23.980]  Everybody I mean remington you've bankrupted them. It's what you do
[2:48:23.980 --> 2:48:28.940]  We're not you stop projecting. We've barely covered it
[2:48:29.900 --> 2:48:34.540]  But they lord love them that they keep going to this judge up there and they keep saying
[2:48:35.820 --> 2:48:38.620]  Your honor it's inconceivable. These are quotes that there's not
[2:48:39.500 --> 2:48:41.020]  sandy hook marketing
[2:48:41.020 --> 2:48:45.420]  Ladies and gentlemen, they've been watching us for years as bob barn says they know our marketing
[2:48:46.220 --> 2:48:48.220]  It's just whatever the specials are in the plaques
[2:48:48.220 --> 2:48:56.460]  Why the citizen landed georgia on here just something they stuck in here the dr. McCam shot let's show this
[2:48:57.100 --> 2:49:02.300]  Dr. McCam shot, please this is milley weavers coming on and then mike adams is hosting
[2:49:03.260 --> 2:49:06.700]  And then there's an opening from a tell from two cities and I stuck that in here
[2:49:07.820 --> 2:49:09.820]  and then there's a
[2:49:10.780 --> 2:49:15.420]  Poster contest we're going to do with a bunch of a bunch of political correct things
[2:49:15.420 --> 2:49:17.820]  And then and then where's my ad folder? Here it is
[2:49:18.620 --> 2:49:21.180]  This is the ad folder. This is the big secret marketing
[2:49:21.900 --> 2:49:23.900]  So I would have the same folder for like 10 years
[2:49:25.500 --> 2:49:31.900]  I haven't plugged the film that we've got out that we're promoting. Uh, we've got the total super force special running
[2:49:33.740 --> 2:49:40.700]  This is the marketing our news is not marketing. I've got 30 40 clips. I didn't get to hundreds of incredible articles
[2:49:40.700 --> 2:49:42.700]  I didn't get to I should have
[2:49:42.700 --> 2:49:47.820]  But see they all come from places where everything is rigged. They're their followers. They they do what they're told
[2:49:47.820 --> 2:49:51.100]  Hillary the dnc says they do it. That's why they were you know put in there
[2:49:52.780 --> 2:49:54.300]  And so
[2:49:54.300 --> 2:49:57.180]  We get norm patis our lawyer up there was here weeks ago
[2:49:58.220 --> 2:50:00.220]  We give max's to google analytics
[2:50:00.620 --> 2:50:06.140]  Which is just the fact we don't even really use google anymore, but when we had google ads going or whatever they put ads on us
[2:50:07.020 --> 2:50:09.020]  That's google's finger on us
[2:50:09.020 --> 2:50:14.300]  And what's happening on the website? That's not that's not us
[2:50:15.100 --> 2:50:16.940]  That's google
[2:50:16.940 --> 2:50:19.100]  And I don't think we've ever run a report that we paid for
[2:50:19.100 --> 2:50:24.460]  I we maybe once a month have maybe looked at what the traffic is we have our own servers that show us that more accurately than them
[2:50:26.060 --> 2:50:31.260]  But that's what's crazy about this is they say new trouble for alex jones in court fight with sandy hook families
[2:50:32.140 --> 2:50:34.140]  This is extremist alex jones
[2:50:34.540 --> 2:50:36.540]  The judge agrees is covering up
[2:50:36.540 --> 2:50:39.580]  The sandy hook bonanza
[2:50:40.860 --> 2:50:42.860]  Well, an okio doesn't exist
[2:50:43.900 --> 2:50:45.260]  um
[2:50:45.260 --> 2:50:47.260]  Unicorns don't exist
[2:50:48.140 --> 2:50:50.140]  It's made up
[2:50:50.380 --> 2:50:52.380]  So I thought I'd bring you in here
[2:50:53.180 --> 2:50:55.900]  Because we had norm here and he's like how do you look at google analytics?
[2:50:55.900 --> 2:50:59.500]  We go we don't know you have to have you have to have like a college degree to even know how to work it
[2:50:59.660 --> 2:51:01.660]  Like there's a degree you get in it
[2:51:01.660 --> 2:51:06.220]  And you go look at it. It's just like it's like the library of congress
[2:51:07.260 --> 2:51:08.460]  bigger
[2:51:08.460 --> 2:51:11.100]  It's like it's like they're telling us give us everything in the library
[2:51:11.740 --> 2:51:17.820]  You're like well, there's 50 000 books or 100 000 books. What do you mean? Well, tell us what's in the books? You're like, uh
[2:51:18.460 --> 2:51:20.460]  So the judge has ordered us
[2:51:21.100 --> 2:51:23.100]  To give them google
[2:51:23.260 --> 2:51:25.260]  That's understand that's like google reaching out
[2:51:25.260 --> 2:51:31.340]  And they're claiming because the internet has google connections that we're supposed to then tell them
[2:51:32.060 --> 2:51:34.060]  Everything that's in the google reports
[2:51:34.220 --> 2:51:38.060]  Even though we've never run a paid report with google. They don't give you anything
[2:51:39.100 --> 2:51:41.260]  You go in there. It's just a basic stuff. So so
[2:51:41.420 --> 2:51:46.460]  Zimmerman, you're a smart guy. We've been trying to comply with this, but this is an impossible order
[2:51:47.260 --> 2:51:51.740]  And it shows that congress and the judges and us too, but this is like
[2:51:52.380 --> 2:51:54.220]  you know phd
[2:51:54.220 --> 2:51:56.220]  Computer science stuff. This is google
[2:51:57.260 --> 2:52:00.700]  There's what artificial intelligence is coming. Will congress be ready?
[2:52:01.500 --> 2:52:03.500]  Of course not congress doesn't know what's going on
[2:52:03.980 --> 2:52:06.940]  Sundar of google gets up there and lies to congress and says
[2:52:07.420 --> 2:52:13.340]  We've never changed search results when their whole business model is that so we'll do a document cam shot over here
[2:52:13.740 --> 2:52:16.620]  This is what we're able to get from google analytics without paying money
[2:52:17.260 --> 2:52:22.300]  It's pretty limited, but it's still a lot of stuff and again the fact is they're in the paper saying
[2:52:22.300 --> 2:52:24.940]  We are covering up
[2:52:26.300 --> 2:52:31.260]  Our relationship with google again google analytics isn't us google analytics is google
[2:52:31.660 --> 2:52:36.060]  And you were saying it's over a hundred thousand dollars around a basic report. We've never paid for report, have we?
[2:52:36.380 --> 2:52:39.900]  No, so to uh to export all of our raw data, which is the entirety of everything
[2:52:39.900 --> 2:52:44.060]  That's a paid product that google has but they they asked for our google analytics
[2:52:44.220 --> 2:52:49.980]  So to attempt to comply with this this request for production. We we gave them dozens of pages
[2:52:49.980 --> 2:52:57.100]  Of basically printouts like this that show a yearly report. So this is january 1st 2012 through december 31st 2012
[2:52:57.900 --> 2:53:03.020]  On prisonplanet.tv. So it shows the number of users shows a graph here of the traffic by day
[2:53:03.740 --> 2:53:05.740]  So we gave them a number of these reports
[2:53:05.900 --> 2:53:11.980]  There's you know a couple dozen pages right here of these of site data because when you log into google analytics
[2:53:11.980 --> 2:53:13.900]  What you do is you generate reports
[2:53:13.900 --> 2:53:16.460]  So asking you know give us your google analytics
[2:53:16.460 --> 2:53:21.740]  Is a question that doesn't make sense in this article you were you're telling me what do you read in the library?
[2:53:21.980 --> 2:53:27.660]  It's like a what does it even mean right? You have to go select a book first. So here's a view on my computer here
[2:53:28.140 --> 2:53:33.500]  So this is may 13th 2019 to june 11th of 2019. So this is an example of your report
[2:53:33.980 --> 2:53:37.260]  Uh, they understand that they can ask for specific reports as part of their
[2:53:37.900 --> 2:53:41.340]  Uh request they've not done that so to say give us all your google analytics
[2:53:41.340 --> 2:53:47.260]  Well, it's an online website that you generate reports through. That's not something that we typically do. We've done that like you said
[2:53:47.260 --> 2:53:50.460]  It's like you've got a faucet hooked to a lake giving all the water
[2:53:51.180 --> 2:53:53.740]  Right, and you're like, well, how do we even load this on trucks?
[2:53:54.940 --> 2:53:59.660]  Right, or you know, you go check the dredge report. You see what's on there right now if they say give us the dredge report. It's like well
[2:54:00.700 --> 2:54:05.580]  What are you looking for specifically? So, uh, they've not been I've got the ruling. It's just just just
[2:54:06.060 --> 2:54:10.140]  She's like, I know you've got reports give them to me and have we ever generated reports?
[2:54:10.140 --> 2:54:15.820]  Very seldom in the past have we generated reports. It's usually just looking at our traffic saying, okay, traffic's up this month
[2:54:15.820 --> 2:54:21.180]  Traffic's down this month. We say very subtle. I don't ever remember asking for a google report. I don't think you've ever asked for one
[2:54:22.380 --> 2:54:25.340]  But my point is though is there's nothing in it because it's just a basic interface
[2:54:25.340 --> 2:54:28.060]  You got to pay all this money and then what would you even get from it?
[2:54:28.380 --> 2:54:31.820]  So this is one report we did look at today that I was telling you about earlier
[2:54:31.820 --> 2:54:38.060]  So this for example is a search for sandy hook. So I think the entire premise here is trying to say that
[2:54:38.060 --> 2:54:41.660]  All we do is talk about sandy hook. Oh, they well, that's all they do
[2:54:42.220 --> 2:54:46.380]  So zoom in or show people this of the it's very hard to see here, but of all the traffic
[2:54:47.100 --> 2:54:53.100]  articles about sandy hook accounted for zero point two eight percent of traffic so less than
[2:54:53.740 --> 2:54:57.500]  1% a fraction of 1% of traffic since 2012
[2:54:57.900 --> 2:54:59.580]  It's such a small part
[2:54:59.580 --> 2:55:05.500]  But they they are under the belief that there's all these marketing materials and like you showed the the folder for plugs and things like that
[2:55:05.500 --> 2:55:06.620]  which
[2:55:06.620 --> 2:55:11.180]  Was of course to comply with them. You you turned all those things over you gave them all the plug sheets of
[2:55:11.660 --> 2:55:16.860]  You know take a take supplements. They're good for you. Take, you know, brain force if you want to you know, stay awake and aware
[2:55:16.860 --> 2:55:23.260]  I mean, that's the extent of the the marketing materials here, but but see they know all that the story is these judges
[2:55:24.380 --> 2:55:26.220]  Literally they're because they come to the preface
[2:55:26.460 --> 2:55:33.180]  He made all this money off sandy hook and they're the lawyers getting money from sandy hook suing dead teachers dead
[2:55:33.980 --> 2:55:35.980]  And then they're they keep saying give us
[2:55:35.980 --> 2:55:39.020]  Keep tell us you made money. We're like there's there's no money off there
[2:55:39.180 --> 2:55:45.260]  No, no you you you live off this and if you look at that number less than 1% most of that since they make me cover it
[2:55:45.660 --> 2:55:49.740]  Right we so again the hoax of this is just
[2:55:50.380 --> 2:55:55.580]  Mind-blowing and I read the judges ruling and I'm like you will be held in contempt unless you give us the google
[2:55:56.780 --> 2:55:58.780]  I'm like give you the google
[2:55:59.820 --> 2:56:01.820]  It's just like oh, here's the google
[2:56:01.820 --> 2:56:06.700]  Oh, here's the secret google so it's it's it's it's incredible my friend
[2:56:07.420 --> 2:56:10.780]  Yeah, and I think you know they understand they can't have a fair trial of us
[2:56:11.260 --> 2:56:16.300]  They lie about what we said. They twist it all of it. They brag. They won't have a kill shot in the first amendment
[2:56:16.300 --> 2:56:20.620]  this is villainous by these lawyers the democrats using these poor families and
[2:56:21.660 --> 2:56:25.340]  The other day I'm not worried because anybody once it looks at this
[2:56:25.340 --> 2:56:31.820]  Even even fake news cannot be go along with this because if they start saying like you know, uh
[2:56:34.620 --> 2:56:40.380]  We're covering something up when there's when there's nothing there. It's insane. It's totally insane. Yeah, and this is google
[2:56:40.380 --> 2:56:43.740]  This is not us. No the numbers show it's it's the smallest of small parts
[2:56:44.220 --> 2:56:48.620]  Uh, and you know, we've given them traffic stats. We've given them all this information. They haven't asked for anything
[2:56:48.620 --> 2:56:50.780]  so well, this will really bite them in the ass too because
[2:56:50.780 --> 2:56:56.460]  There's no way they believe that they know we've talked about like 20 times before they suit us. I mean, they know
[2:56:57.180 --> 2:57:02.220]  Right. Why are they so obsessed with sandy hook man? It's like their whole universe is sitting up
[2:57:03.260 --> 2:57:05.260]  And they say it's us
[2:57:05.660 --> 2:57:11.900]  Right. Well, you've been painted as as this character and every article about you they mentioned Alex Jones who made these claims of sandy hook
[2:57:11.900 --> 2:57:16.620]  Who's being sued by the sandy hook parents every time you see your name mentioned somewhere. They put that right under it
[2:57:16.620 --> 2:57:18.620]  They're making you that guy
[2:57:18.620 --> 2:57:22.700]  And even though you've you've had all this saying that you like that cash, huh?
[2:57:23.740 --> 2:57:27.660]  You know, it's just like it's it's it's it's it's Hillary cooked it up
[2:57:29.580 --> 2:57:33.100]  She's the one she comes out she goes he is a nazi with frogs
[2:57:33.660 --> 2:57:35.820]  They go jones is a nazi with a frog so him
[2:57:36.380 --> 2:57:41.180]  Jones and they they just they worship her they they love her they need her

[3:00:09.820 --> 3:00:15.020]  review of sundar pachai's latest uh act of of lies
[3:00:16.060 --> 3:00:18.060]  about censorship
[3:00:18.060 --> 3:00:21.020]  And i got a bunch of crazy comments about it to show on the whole internet
[3:00:21.500 --> 3:00:23.500]  Totally rejecting it, but i'm just gonna do that tomorrow
[3:00:30.780 --> 3:00:37.500]  Mike Adams is gonna take over he is loaded for bear ready to go uh on the other side of this break
[3:00:37.500 --> 3:00:42.060]  I'll just please remind listeners that we won't be here without your support
[3:00:42.860 --> 3:00:44.860]  And i appreciate your support
[3:00:44.860 --> 3:00:46.860]  The human community is being purposely
[3:00:48.300 --> 3:00:50.300]  destabilized we're being purposely
[3:00:50.380 --> 3:00:52.380]  um
[3:00:52.620 --> 3:00:55.500]  Prepared for collapse and then the globalists admit that's their plan
[3:00:57.020 --> 3:01:00.060]  We're simply promoting a pro human future here
[3:01:00.860 --> 3:01:02.860]  as best we can
[3:01:02.860 --> 3:01:07.820]  And i'm very thankful to all of you. I'm not complaining. I'm not bitching. I'm just simply saying
[3:01:08.380 --> 3:01:11.180]  If you want to see us continue into the future continue to spread the word
[3:01:11.740 --> 3:01:18.140]  Continue to pray for us continue to buy the products because that's how we defeat the globalist and it's your action and you stand with us
[3:01:18.140 --> 3:01:19.740]  which you've done
[3:01:19.740 --> 3:01:21.740]  This allowed us to stay in the game
[3:01:22.300 --> 3:01:24.300]  this long
[3:01:24.540 --> 3:01:27.660]  To have not one but two articles the top of drubsreport.com today
[3:01:27.660 --> 3:01:32.060]  Showing the massive invasion of the u.s. Showing the u.n. funding
[3:01:33.580 --> 3:01:35.580]  Showing people from obola
[3:01:36.700 --> 3:01:42.060]  Infested countries pouring in untested, untracked. This is important stuff
[3:01:42.940 --> 3:01:44.940]  And that's why we're here
[3:01:46.060 --> 3:01:50.780]  We're gonna send our reporters up to gallus next to cover the next level the refugee centers, but here is a
[3:01:50.780 --> 3:01:57.260]  Lawyer talking about the situation then my cat. I'm just coming in
[3:02:00.380 --> 3:02:03.820]  So the info wars model is a self-fulfilling self-supporting
[3:02:04.380 --> 3:02:08.380]  Structure that is in the ultimate economic dema little d democracy
[3:02:09.020 --> 3:02:16.380]  Structure that is promoting free press and free speech by people getting together and supporting one another and sustaining one another
[3:02:16.380 --> 3:02:20.460]  The independent press of this size and scale of this public reach
[3:02:21.340 --> 3:02:25.100]  It's reached so effective that that's why facebook is waging war against info wars
[3:02:25.100 --> 3:02:27.500]  That's why instagram is waging war against info wars
[3:02:27.740 --> 3:02:35.340]  That's why google and youtube and twitter are waging war against info wars more than anyone else is because it is the ultimate counter china model
[3:02:35.420 --> 3:02:39.100]  It is the one model that says here's a way to have a self-supporting
[3:02:39.660 --> 3:02:40.940]  self-sustaining
[3:02:40.940 --> 3:02:47.420]  Self-structured little d democratic structure that because the the the audience determines what content goes up
[3:02:47.660 --> 3:02:53.420]  The audience determines what the what audience has ultimately reached by their choices and supporting info wars
[3:02:53.580 --> 3:02:56.700]  So by doing little things like okay, we want a little d democracy
[3:02:56.700 --> 3:02:59.900]  We want a fluoride free toothpaste. Let's say that's what it is
[3:02:59.900 --> 3:03:06.700]  So it's dealing with a particular health issue where you have the health industry pushing one product overwhelmingly the big farm of big companies
[3:03:06.700 --> 3:03:12.620]  The the corporate model the chinese model the statist corporate model that china has promoted against info wars model
[3:03:12.620 --> 3:03:14.620]  Which is we're going to have an american-created product
[3:03:14.700 --> 3:03:16.700]  We're going to sell that directly to our own people
[3:03:17.020 --> 3:03:21.980]  Our people will decide whether they want to support it or not and by choosing to buy little products like that
[3:03:22.220 --> 3:03:28.540]  They're able to fuel this independent press that is the only one that is not dependent on billionaire donors or sugar daddy's
[3:03:28.540 --> 3:03:30.940]  That is not dependent on big corporate sponsors
[3:03:31.020 --> 3:03:35.660]  That is not dependent on getting the approval of the social media giants in order to spread their message
[3:03:35.660 --> 3:03:41.260]  And it's all because the audience spends there whatever it is whether it's five dollars or fifty dollars a month on products
[3:03:41.260 --> 3:03:46.140]  That they like and that they want that actually compete with the corporate driven model and the ability to do that
[3:03:46.220 --> 3:03:50.780]  And at the same time support press support speech support letting the audience choose
[3:03:50.940 --> 3:03:56.700]  What news they want to see and what views they want to hold and it's the ultimate american democratic expression and experiment
[3:03:56.780 --> 3:04:03.100]  And it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets and doing so in a way that's not corporate driven
[3:04:03.100 --> 3:04:07.020]  The reason why they don't see news change at info wars or content change at info wars
[3:04:07.020 --> 3:04:12.700]  Except as requested or thought about by the audience is because the audience controls it because the audience has chosen as self
[3:04:13.020 --> 3:04:18.700]  Supporting self sustaining economic model by making small contributions by buying products
[3:04:19.340 --> 3:04:22.700]  They already want at a more affordable rate by sustaining it
[3:04:22.940 --> 3:04:26.700]  They create a self sustaining self supporting structure that is unique in the world
[3:04:26.860 --> 3:04:30.620]  And that's why they wage war against it and as long as the audience refuses to concede to that
[3:04:30.620 --> 3:04:37.660]  Or forfeit their economic contribution as long as they continue to be involved and continue to participate and continue to partake
[3:04:37.900 --> 3:04:40.620]  And continue to this self supporting self sustaining structure
[3:04:40.860 --> 3:04:45.820]  There's nothing they can literally do to crush it or end it all that they can try to limit the scope of the audience
[3:04:45.820 --> 3:04:47.660]  They can try to limit the size of the microphone
[3:04:47.740 --> 3:04:53.100]  But in the end we will find ways to reach them because the audience dictates and determines it by its support of info wars
[3:04:54.540 --> 3:04:56.540]  info wars the most banned
[3:04:56.940 --> 3:04:58.620]  network in the world
[3:04:58.620 --> 3:05:01.020]  So the info wars model is a self fulfilling
[3:05:01.420 --> 3:05:07.420]  Self supporting structure that is promoting free press and free speech by people getting together and supporting one another
[3:05:07.580 --> 3:05:13.660]  And sustaining one another it is the only independent press of this size and scale of this public reach
[3:05:13.820 --> 3:05:17.260]  It is the one model that says here's a way to have a self supporting
[3:05:17.580 --> 3:05:23.900]  Self sustaining self structured little d democratic structure that because the audience determines what content goes up
[3:05:23.900 --> 3:05:30.300]  The audience determines what audience is ultimately reached by their choices and supporting info wars and it's all because the audience spends
[3:05:30.300 --> 3:05:35.980]  There whatever it is whether it's five dollars or fifty dollars a month on products that they like and that they want that actually compete
[3:05:36.060 --> 3:05:41.500]  With the corporate driven model and the ability to do that and at the same time support press support speech
[3:05:41.660 --> 3:05:46.140]  Support letting the audience choose what news they want to see and what views they want to hold
[3:05:46.140 --> 3:05:54.380]  And it's the ultimate american democratic expression and experiment and it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets
[3:06:00.620 --> 3:06:06.780]  We now take you live to the central texas command center and the heart of the resistance
[3:06:07.260 --> 3:06:12.620]  It's mike adams. You're listening to the alex jones show
[3:06:12.620 --> 3:06:20.780]  Thanks for joining us mike adams here stepping in for the fourth hour of the alex jones show today
[3:06:21.420 --> 3:06:25.580]  And we've got a lot to cover here in this hour. I'm also going to be sticking around to join
[3:06:26.060 --> 3:06:29.340]  Oh shroyer in the war room for a couple of segments as well
[3:06:30.060 --> 3:06:33.820]  You know all this week info wars here has been covering the ebola
[3:06:34.380 --> 3:06:40.540]  risk from bringing migrants into the united states and having them distributed across cities including
[3:06:40.540 --> 3:06:47.180]  San Antonio texas and what is the real risk associated with a possible ebola carrier?
[3:06:47.660 --> 3:06:49.660]  Well, i'm here today to tell you that
[3:06:50.140 --> 3:06:53.660]  Of course the mainstream media has been lying to you about this for many years
[3:06:53.980 --> 3:06:58.460]  But if you go back far enough, you'll find that even the new york times
[3:06:58.940 --> 3:07:04.700]  Reported that people could carry ebola without showing any symptoms of ebola whatsoever
[3:07:05.260 --> 3:07:09.420]  In fact, it's a 2000 year 2000 article from the new york times
[3:07:09.420 --> 3:07:12.780]  That talks about symptomless carriers of ebola
[3:07:13.180 --> 3:07:18.300]  And it cites in fact a study from the national library of medicine that i'll be talking about coming up in the war room with
[3:07:18.380 --> 3:07:21.740]  Oh shroyer and in that study they found that
[3:07:22.380 --> 3:07:24.380]  people from africa
[3:07:24.700 --> 3:07:31.340]  Seem to have a natural kind of defense against ebola and other similar hemorrhagic fever
[3:07:31.740 --> 3:07:35.740]  Diseases viral diseases that are more common in continents like africa
[3:07:36.300 --> 3:07:37.820]  and because of that
[3:07:37.820 --> 3:07:43.740]  People of african descent have a natural ability to carry the virus without being killed by it
[3:07:44.220 --> 3:07:49.900]  They say ebola has an 80 fatality rate if you're infected, but that's not actually true
[3:07:50.380 --> 3:07:54.220]  It's an 80 fatality rate if you begin to show symptoms
[3:07:54.620 --> 3:07:58.300]  But there are many people who can be infected with ebola and never show symptoms
[3:07:58.780 --> 3:08:02.860]  And those people tend to be those from africa or of african descent
[3:08:02.860 --> 3:08:10.700]  In other words, people who live in africa or who have ancestors who lived in africa have a natural kind of built-in bonus
[3:08:11.260 --> 3:08:13.260]  immunity against ebola
[3:08:13.260 --> 3:08:19.020]  That individuals who are from european nations or more caucasian individuals do not have
[3:08:19.660 --> 3:08:25.020]  And what this means for america and i haven't seen anybody talk about this anywhere in the country
[3:08:25.500 --> 3:08:29.420]  What this means is that if there is an ebola outbreak in the united states
[3:08:29.420 --> 3:08:32.620]  This outbreak could disproportionately
[3:08:33.500 --> 3:08:35.500]  affect people of
[3:08:35.500 --> 3:08:40.060]  European descent in other words african americans would be more naturally immune to it
[3:08:40.700 --> 3:08:44.220]  And white people would be more harmed by it
[3:08:44.940 --> 3:08:48.700]  Now i know some of you out there might be thinking well gosh suddenly it makes sense
[3:08:48.780 --> 3:08:52.140]  Maybe that's what the globalists are trying to do. I'm not saying that's the case
[3:08:52.620 --> 3:08:58.300]  I'm just talking about straight science here natural immunities countries of origin and so on for example
[3:08:58.300 --> 3:09:03.100]  People of african descent have natural high levels of melanin in their skin
[3:09:03.420 --> 3:09:09.500]  And that's what allows them to block the ultraviolet radiation black skin is really kind of a natural sunblock
[3:09:09.580 --> 3:09:15.500]  It's a it's a benefit. It's a necessity if you're living in africa to have this natural sunblock
[3:09:15.900 --> 3:09:19.340]  But people from africa also have other genetic
[3:09:20.220 --> 3:09:22.220]  advantages or benefits such as
[3:09:22.220 --> 3:09:28.620]  Certain formations of their blood cells that help them resist infections such as ebola
[3:09:29.500 --> 3:09:34.380]  And there's also a downside to some of that by the way. They can have sickle cell anemia
[3:09:35.020 --> 3:09:38.540]  Of misshapen blood cells, but if you really do your research
[3:09:38.540 --> 3:09:42.860]  You'll find that that those advantages and those disadvantages are actually tied together
[3:09:43.340 --> 3:09:47.580]  Sometimes it's the same mechanism that gives you both a benefit or a protection in one
[3:09:47.580 --> 3:09:54.460]  Context but makes you more vulnerable in another context and this is what people of african descent actually have and those of you listening who are
[3:09:55.020 --> 3:09:58.140]  african-american or even in other countries if you're of african descent
[3:09:59.100 --> 3:10:04.140]  You it's important to know this about your own physiology. You may have more natural immunity to ebola
[3:10:04.540 --> 3:10:11.180]  But you may have more susceptibility to other conditions such as sickle cell anemia in any case if ebola
[3:10:11.660 --> 3:10:13.660]  escapes in america
[3:10:13.660 --> 3:10:19.420]  It would be devastating for lots of reasons now oan has interviewed a physician
[3:10:19.980 --> 3:10:27.100]  Who says there's no risk of ebola getting out even though it's in these migrants who are traveling from ebola stricken regions
[3:10:28.060 --> 3:10:33.420]  And this doctor. I think oan's going to play a several minutes of an interview. This doctor says that
[3:10:34.300 --> 3:10:39.260]  The incubation time period of ebola is about three weeks and these people have been traveling more than three weeks and so on
[3:10:39.500 --> 3:10:41.500]  So they're saying there's no risk
[3:10:41.500 --> 3:10:45.180]  Well, that's not true. The risk is non zero
[3:10:45.660 --> 3:10:49.100]  The risk may be low on any given individual granted. I'll give you that
[3:10:49.740 --> 3:10:53.820]  But the cost of being wrong is so high
[3:10:54.540 --> 3:11:00.380]  And the incompetence of the medical establishment in america is so great and so well documented
[3:11:01.020 --> 3:11:06.140]  That we must be very cautious and we need to be informed and we need to have our our guard up about all of this
[3:11:06.380 --> 3:11:09.500]  For example, when ebola came into the united states a few years ago
[3:11:09.500 --> 3:11:15.180]  Remember how they brought that patient in to texas they put a patient in a hospital in texas and they told us
[3:11:15.580 --> 3:11:20.300]  Don't worry. It'll never get out. No one will ever get infected. We have this under control
[3:11:20.700 --> 3:11:27.100]  And then what happened almost immediately a health care practitioner got infected a nurse got infected, right?
[3:11:27.180 --> 3:11:32.700]  Remember that so of course this set off a wave of alarm, which was justified alarm
[3:11:33.100 --> 3:11:37.580]  But then the cdc kept telling us don't worry. We have it under control now
[3:11:37.580 --> 3:11:44.620]  Well, what if it continued to spread? What if it starts spreading outside of a hospital environment? What if it spreads?
[3:11:45.580 --> 3:11:47.740]  In a migrant processing center
[3:11:47.740 --> 3:11:55.420]  What if it spreads on the streets the streets of san francisco the streets of los angeles that are already filthy places
[3:11:55.820 --> 3:12:02.140]  With almost no real hygiene going on and they're being abandoned the homeless people are being abandoned there by
[3:12:02.140 --> 3:12:07.820]  You know the democrats in charge of those cities if you get ebola mixed in with those kinds of environments
[3:12:08.380 --> 3:12:10.860]  You probably cannot stop it without
[3:12:11.820 --> 3:12:12.860]  extreme
[3:12:12.860 --> 3:12:14.860]  medical police state measures
[3:12:15.260 --> 3:12:21.500]  And that's the the risk. I mean the cost of ebola getting out is so high that you have to take steps
[3:12:21.980 --> 3:12:26.940]  We need to be testing these people for ebola and other infectious diseases before they come into the country
[3:12:26.940 --> 3:12:34.780]  Just meeting people at the border and depositing them somewhere in america is not an acceptable policy when it comes to health
[3:12:35.180 --> 3:12:37.180]  or public safety and yet
[3:12:37.740 --> 3:12:42.460]  To a large extent that has been the policy. We cannot allow that to happen
[3:12:43.340 --> 3:12:44.780]  now
[3:12:44.780 --> 3:12:49.740]  In a study that's cited in the national library of medicine study was published by the land set
[3:12:50.380 --> 3:12:51.500]  medical journal
[3:12:51.500 --> 3:12:54.060]  Maybe i'll get a url for that for you in the next segment
[3:12:54.060 --> 3:12:59.420]  That study found that nearly 100 of the people that they
[3:12:59.980 --> 3:13:01.740]  studied from africa
[3:13:01.740 --> 3:13:03.740]  Had antibodies for ebola
[3:13:04.140 --> 3:13:06.140]  What does that mean? It means that
[3:13:06.940 --> 3:13:08.940]  according to mainstream science that
[3:13:09.100 --> 3:13:12.140]  Almost 100 of those people were exposed to ebola
[3:13:12.780 --> 3:13:19.260]  But it didn't kill them. In fact, they showed no symptoms and what can happen even after you build antibodies
[3:13:19.260 --> 3:13:23.580]  There can be viral fragments or viable
[3:13:24.460 --> 3:13:27.260]  Viruses that continue to persist throughout your body
[3:13:27.900 --> 3:13:29.900]  And they can exist in body fluids
[3:13:30.540 --> 3:13:31.740]  such as
[3:13:31.740 --> 3:13:32.860]  mucus
[3:13:32.860 --> 3:13:34.140]  or semen
[3:13:34.140 --> 3:13:36.940]  Or blood of course or or other body fluids
[3:13:37.420 --> 3:13:41.180]  And this is how many viral diseases spread including ebola
[3:13:41.420 --> 3:13:44.620]  But what happens when you have essentially dormant ebola?
[3:13:45.020 --> 3:13:47.660]  That's in a person's body showing no symptoms
[3:13:47.660 --> 3:13:53.900]  And the science has also shown that some of those people will not test positive for ebola right away
[3:13:54.780 --> 3:13:58.300]  They can have ebola for a period of time in other words and show no symptoms
[3:13:58.540 --> 3:14:01.820]  And not even test positive for ebola if there's a medical test given
[3:14:02.700 --> 3:14:04.940]  If those individuals arrive in the united states
[3:14:05.580 --> 3:14:08.380]  And then they begin to for example
[3:14:08.940 --> 3:14:12.620]  In whatever way you might imagine share body fluids with the american people
[3:14:12.620 --> 3:14:20.300]  Who may not be from africa and may be more susceptible to these infections you could theoretically get
[3:14:21.420 --> 3:14:23.420]  dormant ebola
[3:14:23.660 --> 3:14:31.100]  From a carrier who has no symptoms suddenly transforming into active ebola in someone who has no immunity
[3:14:32.220 --> 3:14:38.860]  That's the scenario that i'm warning about that's the scenario really that infowars has been talking about and alex jones has been talking about
[3:14:38.860 --> 3:14:42.780]  This week i'm just breaking it down in a little more medical terms for you
[3:14:43.740 --> 3:14:45.980]  That's the scenario that can happen and so
[3:14:46.780 --> 3:14:49.340]  If that were to happen it could be devastating
[3:14:50.060 --> 3:14:57.260]  But even worse as i mentioned on the show i think i popped in a couple of days ago here for the show a segment with alex
[3:14:58.140 --> 3:15:06.300]  This environment of an outbreak of ebola could be used as a cover story for the release of an intentional biological weapon
[3:15:06.300 --> 3:15:12.220]  A biological weapons system. That's been bioengineered. That's been genetically altered
[3:15:13.020 --> 3:15:16.620]  To cause mass fatalities even to target specific races
[3:15:17.580 --> 3:15:19.500]  Now that technology exists
[3:15:19.500 --> 3:15:21.580]  And it's been researched for a very long time
[3:15:22.140 --> 3:15:25.420]  We know that there are bio weapons under development
[3:15:26.060 --> 3:15:28.060]  By militaries around the world
[3:15:28.140 --> 3:15:33.100]  That can target specific races of individuals or people of certain national origins
[3:15:33.100 --> 3:15:38.620]  Think about that and the dangers of that in the deep state and how they hate humanity now
[3:15:38.780 --> 3:15:41.500]  And they want to eliminate so many people from our planet
[3:15:42.220 --> 3:15:48.620]  That is what may be coming. We'll have much more straight ahead here on the alex jones show. Stay with us. We'll be right back
[3:15:53.340 --> 3:15:58.140]  Hi, i'm dan pilla. I started fighting the irs over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house

[3:16:29.180 --> 3:16:31.980]  George washington had warned us against foreign wars

[3:16:38.060 --> 3:16:44.140]  Its former colony the us had to save the empire. Was there ever a vote? Who do we fight for?

[3:17:57.500 --> 3:18:01.100]  Introducing pollen block. We have found an extraordinary new
[3:18:01.100 --> 3:18:10.620]  Natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways eye comfort and respiratory function
[3:18:11.260 --> 3:18:16.380]  In the 1960s researchers in france notice that people who ate certain quail eggs
[3:18:16.860 --> 3:18:24.220]  Experience less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses. They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later
[3:18:24.220 --> 3:18:31.100]  We now have the fruit of this research a fast-acting chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[3:18:31.580 --> 3:18:35.500]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine
[3:18:35.900 --> 3:18:40.780]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase
[3:18:40.860 --> 3:18:45.420]  Which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body
[3:18:45.900 --> 3:18:48.060]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe

[3:20:02.060 --> 3:20:21.500]  You found it the tip of the spear it is the alex jones show with mike adams
[3:20:23.500 --> 3:20:26.460]  Going to give you a fascinating breakdown here of
[3:20:27.180 --> 3:20:30.140]  events that took place over the last few days involving
[3:20:30.140 --> 3:20:34.140]  Facebook censorship and also the lgbt
[3:20:35.100 --> 3:20:36.940]  child mutilation
[3:20:36.940 --> 3:20:38.940]  Phenomenon that is now
[3:20:38.940 --> 3:20:46.140]  Sadly happening in our world. I'm going to preface this with a warning that I'm not intentionally trying to make this discussion
[3:20:46.860 --> 3:20:52.300]  Graphic, but we do need to cover the facts of what is happening since of course nobody in the left-wing media
[3:20:52.780 --> 3:20:56.460]  Is going to ever dare talk about this. So I'll try to keep the language as
[3:20:57.260 --> 3:20:58.780]  as
[3:20:58.780 --> 3:21:04.940]  I don't know as calm as I can here, but here's a fascinating timeline Friday night
[3:21:05.820 --> 3:21:11.980]  Natural news that's my website gets hit with all these hit pieces from radical left-wing media the same liars
[3:21:12.300 --> 3:21:17.980]  That of course attack president trump or push the russia collusion hoax or push climate change hoaxes and all these other things
[3:21:19.020 --> 3:21:21.020]  Saturday midday facebook
[3:21:21.420 --> 3:21:24.060]  Bands us completely deletes our channel
[3:21:24.060 --> 3:21:31.260]  D platforms us erases our whole history and we lose the three million nearly three million followers that we had
[3:21:32.380 --> 3:21:34.380]  Then it was I think
[3:21:34.540 --> 3:21:39.020]  Tuesday morning or somewhere around then that I learned that facebook
[3:21:39.580 --> 3:21:43.260]  Says that they banned natural news because of an article
[3:21:43.820 --> 3:21:47.660]  That we had published but not posted to facebook and so this
[3:21:48.460 --> 3:21:51.500]  An account of this is posted on info wars.com right now
[3:21:51.500 --> 3:21:58.060]  It says that natural news was banned for off-platform content. What this means is that facebook is
[3:21:58.940 --> 3:22:03.580]  Reading the things that you are writing or posting that you don't even post to facebook
[3:22:04.300 --> 3:22:10.620]  And they are now banning you or they banned us for an article that they did not like and that article was entitled
[3:22:11.340 --> 3:22:15.260]  lgbt progressivism horrors and that article
[3:22:15.980 --> 3:22:17.980]  predicted this was
[3:22:17.980 --> 3:22:23.020]  This article was published in may not even a month ago that article written by myself
[3:22:23.660 --> 3:22:25.660]  predicted that
[3:22:26.060 --> 3:22:31.660]  Because of the so-called nullo movement where certain individuals are cutting off their
[3:22:32.620 --> 3:22:38.700]  Their certain organs to try to become genderless. This is well documented. It's well known. It's it's been covered in the media
[3:22:38.860 --> 3:22:40.460]  They're called nullos
[3:22:40.460 --> 3:22:42.460]  because of that and the
[3:22:42.460 --> 3:22:48.300]  Psychosis and mass mental illness of the certain a certain fringe segment of the lgbt movement
[3:22:48.620 --> 3:22:51.820]  I predicted that we would start to see progressive parents
[3:22:52.540 --> 3:22:57.500]  mutilating their own infants to try to perform transgender
[3:22:58.540 --> 3:23:05.500]  Alterations on their babies and I know it's a it's a very morbid. It's a very it's a horrific idea to even think that that could ever happen
[3:23:05.500 --> 3:23:12.220]  But I I knew that this was coming because I could see the sickness and the insanity
[3:23:12.620 --> 3:23:19.740]  Of where this progressivism movement is going so I published that article as a prediction to say this is going to happen
[3:23:20.220 --> 3:23:24.460]  Because the lgbt movement has lost its mind or at least some segment of it has
[3:23:25.260 --> 3:23:32.380]  And they're going to target children just like they they now murder babies. They call it women's reproductive health if you can believe that
[3:23:32.380 --> 3:23:36.060]  If they're willing to murder a child, why wouldn't they be willing to
[3:23:36.940 --> 3:23:39.740]  Perform their DIY at-home transgender
[3:23:40.300 --> 3:23:43.020]  mutilation surgery on them. So that was my prediction
[3:23:43.900 --> 3:23:44.700]  Now
[3:23:44.700 --> 3:23:48.460]  guess what happens as of I think two days ago a
[3:23:49.180 --> 3:23:54.940]  lesbian couple from brazil arrested and charged with murder
[3:23:55.500 --> 3:24:00.540]  for killing their own adopted young boy an infant boy
[3:24:00.540 --> 3:24:03.980]  An infant boy. I think the name is who on may con
[3:24:05.180 --> 3:24:06.380]  was
[3:24:06.380 --> 3:24:08.380]  Killed by his lesbian
[3:24:08.940 --> 3:24:10.940]  you know lgbt parents
[3:24:11.660 --> 3:24:15.980]  They they killed him after they botched a transgender surgery
[3:24:16.700 --> 3:24:21.260]  Effort where they were trying to again. I apologize in advance. I'm not trying to make this
[3:24:21.980 --> 3:24:24.460]  More graphic than it needs to be there's a male baby
[3:24:24.460 --> 3:24:30.860]  They they tried they they used instruments around the house to try to remove the male organs
[3:24:31.100 --> 3:24:36.540]  And they tried to create female organs in this infant. I I know it's absolutely sickening
[3:24:37.740 --> 3:24:42.220]  If you think about it too much you almost start to cry about what is happening to these babies
[3:24:42.540 --> 3:24:48.940]  It's beyond horrific. It's beyond criminal. It's it's worse than what a serial killer would do. This is
[3:24:49.580 --> 3:24:51.580]  sickening sickening criminal
[3:24:51.580 --> 3:24:55.500]  Behavior that these lgbt progressives are pushing
[3:24:56.380 --> 3:25:00.620]  And when they botched the surgery, I call it surgery they're they're at home
[3:25:01.420 --> 3:25:03.420]  Mutilation effort when they botched it
[3:25:03.580 --> 3:25:05.580]  They decided to kill the baby
[3:25:06.300 --> 3:25:09.580]  And in their minds, I guess, you know, maybe they've been watching the
[3:25:09.980 --> 3:25:17.180]  Legislature in new york that stood up and applauded and celebrated in fantasy because did you know there's no time limit on those laws?
[3:25:17.180 --> 3:25:23.180]  That in new york you can kill your baby at any age. There's no time limit. They just call it abortion
[3:25:23.260 --> 3:25:30.140]  I guess you could decide you want to kill your baby at six months old or maybe even six years old. Who knows they didn't state any limits
[3:25:31.100 --> 3:25:32.140]  so
[3:25:32.140 --> 3:25:34.140]  you know given that and given the push for
[3:25:34.620 --> 3:25:35.900]  child murder
[3:25:35.900 --> 3:25:41.900]  And baby butchery that is now being pushed by the the radical left in america today can can you
[3:25:42.620 --> 3:25:44.380]  I mean you could almost
[3:25:44.380 --> 3:25:50.780]  I don't even want to say understand you can understand sort of where this psychosis is coming from that these
[3:25:51.580 --> 3:25:53.580]  lgbt parents in brazil
[3:25:54.620 --> 3:26:01.500]  Thought well, they they messed it up. They didn't make the right cuts in the right places. I guess so they went ahead and killed the baby
[3:26:03.500 --> 3:26:07.740]  And what's even more shocking about this is that their actions
[3:26:08.220 --> 3:26:11.980]  Even though they are illegal in brazil and these two have been arrested and charged with murder
[3:26:11.980 --> 3:26:15.740]  Their actions would have been legal in new york. You understand that?
[3:26:17.020 --> 3:26:25.740]  Mutilating your own baby and murdering your own baby is legal in the state of new york today in america
[3:26:27.260 --> 3:26:33.580]  That is just as horrifying that realization is as horrifying as the acts themselves
[3:26:34.620 --> 3:26:40.620]  And despite the fact that I have been of course attacked and smeared and deplatformed and censored
[3:26:40.620 --> 3:26:42.620]  For daring to stand up
[3:26:43.340 --> 3:26:45.900]  For the recently born as well as the unborn
[3:26:46.780 --> 3:26:48.460]  Despite all of that
[3:26:48.460 --> 3:26:54.220]  The fact that this is happening has me doubling down and I know that everybody here at info wars is doubling down on the idea
[3:26:54.620 --> 3:26:56.620]  That we must protect
[3:26:57.020 --> 3:26:59.900]  These innocent children who cannot speak for themselves
[3:27:00.460 --> 3:27:02.060]  They cannot fight
[3:27:02.060 --> 3:27:06.460]  They're not born with the ability to fight back. They can't even say anything
[3:27:06.460 --> 3:27:11.740]  They're not old enough yet, and they certainly aren't old enough to make a decision that they want to be a transgender
[3:27:12.140 --> 3:27:14.140]  That is put on them
[3:27:14.220 --> 3:27:21.100]  By parents who are not acting out of love or compassion. They're acting out of malicious
[3:27:21.820 --> 3:27:23.820]  demonic
[3:27:23.900 --> 3:27:26.460]  torturous just pure evil
[3:27:27.020 --> 3:27:32.060]  Seething through these people and when they start targeting these innocent children
[3:27:32.060 --> 3:27:35.580]  God demands that we stand up and say
[3:27:36.460 --> 3:27:38.460]  This must stop
[3:27:38.540 --> 3:27:40.540]  If we do not value the lives of children
[3:27:41.180 --> 3:27:46.380]  In our society then then how do we protect the lives of anyone in our society? In fact
[3:27:47.180 --> 3:27:51.180]  So many of the arguments being made today in favor of abortion and infanticide
[3:27:52.060 --> 3:27:57.580]  Are eerily similar to the arguments that used to be made in favor of slavery. I'm not saying the two are the same thing
[3:27:57.580 --> 3:28:02.300]  But the arguments are starting to sound very similar when the left starts to say, well, they're not really human
[3:28:03.260 --> 3:28:05.260]  remember when the supreme court
[3:28:05.260 --> 3:28:09.260]  issued a decision that said that they thought that that
[3:28:10.060 --> 3:28:14.700]  Black slaves in their view are only I think five eighths human. What that doesn't make any sense
[3:28:14.700 --> 3:28:19.980]  But that's a similar argument to the abortionist today that oh, it's not even a human baby
[3:28:19.980 --> 3:28:21.980]  You're not a mother
[3:28:21.980 --> 3:28:25.580]  Even though you're nine months pregnant, even though you're giving birth. They say you're not even a mother
[3:28:25.580 --> 3:28:27.580]  You're not a mother until you decide not to kill it
[3:28:28.380 --> 3:28:31.580]  That's where we are in America today and it has got to be stopped
[3:28:32.540 --> 3:28:37.340]  If we don't protect the lives of the innocent then maybe maybe we haven't earned the right
[3:28:38.220 --> 3:28:42.380]  To be humans ourselves. I don't know. We got to stand up and do something. We'll be right back after this break
[3:28:42.380 --> 3:28:44.380]  Mike Adams here for the Alex Jones show
[3:28:51.180 --> 3:28:53.180]  Oh
[3:28:53.180 --> 3:28:58.620]  Oh these pains my neck my back shoulders. I've got to get some relief
[3:28:59.180 --> 3:29:04.620]  Stress from everyday life past injuries or surgeries can cause inflammation that leads to pain
[3:29:04.780 --> 3:29:08.540]  But you don't want to take another pill. There's an easier healthier way, right?

[3:32:51.740 --> 3:33:00.220]  Hey, you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:33:13.100 --> 3:33:16.140]  From the front lines of the information war
[3:33:16.140 --> 3:33:22.060]  It's alex jones and now your host mike adams
[3:33:24.940 --> 3:33:26.940]  You know the authoritarian
[3:33:26.940 --> 3:33:28.940]  philosophy of the left today is
[3:33:29.660 --> 3:33:33.900]  It's striking in its arrogance and its danger to humanity
[3:33:34.860 --> 3:33:38.540]  I remember when the left used to argue for civil liberties like the freedom to speak
[3:33:38.780 --> 3:33:43.900]  they said well everybody deserves the right to speak and that was a valid argument and I think
[3:33:43.900 --> 3:33:48.460]  a lot of modern-day liberals were liberals because
[3:33:49.580 --> 3:33:54.220]  You know the the left used to have some kind of principles, but now they've abandoned those principles and they're all
[3:33:54.700 --> 3:33:56.140]  Authoritarians
[3:33:56.140 --> 3:34:02.060]  And they demand of course that you conform to their ideas no matter how twisted they are no matter how much they
[3:34:02.540 --> 3:34:04.540]  lack any real facts
[3:34:04.860 --> 3:34:07.740]  They demand you conform or you will be banned
[3:34:08.540 --> 3:34:09.420]  and
[3:34:09.420 --> 3:34:14.300]  The method of being banned this is what this is really the focus of the segment the method of being banned
[3:34:14.940 --> 3:34:17.340]  No longer makes any rational sense whatsoever
[3:34:17.980 --> 3:34:21.500]  For example when we were blacklisted by youtube over a year ago
[3:34:21.980 --> 3:34:23.980]  There was no reason given when we were
[3:34:24.860 --> 3:34:26.860]  Cut off by twitter no reason
[3:34:27.100 --> 3:34:30.940]  They we contacted them. Why why are we banned by twitter?
[3:34:31.740 --> 3:34:33.740]  and so well, we don't have to give you a reason
[3:34:33.740 --> 3:34:39.340]  And just the other day facebook banned us and then but they did give us a reason they said how dare you talk about
[3:34:39.980 --> 3:34:43.420]  You know saving children from lgbt mutilations and then
[3:34:44.060 --> 3:34:47.740]  You know the next day comes out lgbt mutilations of children are happening
[3:34:48.140 --> 3:34:51.100]  So where's my apology from mark zuckerberg, right?
[3:34:51.660 --> 3:34:57.180]  Where why aren't they reinstating national news because we were right? We actually had the prediction correct
[3:34:58.300 --> 3:35:00.300]  But now pinterest
[3:35:00.300 --> 3:35:04.780]  Has been caught using a completely irrational method
[3:35:05.340 --> 3:35:07.100]  to ban
[3:35:07.100 --> 3:35:14.140]  Lifesite news or I think zero hedge was caught up in this and many other conservative and pro-life and pro-christian websites
[3:35:14.460 --> 3:35:19.740]  pinterest has a list an internal list and this has come out from james o' keith at project veritas
[3:35:19.740 --> 3:35:21.740]  We're going to play a couple minutes of his video here
[3:35:22.300 --> 3:35:24.300]  pinterest has
[3:35:24.300 --> 3:35:30.220]  Added conservative and pro-life and pro-christian websites to its internal porn ban list
[3:35:31.100 --> 3:35:32.540]  so so
[3:35:32.540 --> 3:35:33.740]  if you
[3:35:33.740 --> 3:35:37.180]  Preach the bible if you cite bible verses
[3:35:38.060 --> 3:35:40.060]  In the perversion of pinterest
[3:35:40.700 --> 3:35:42.860]  You are added to their porn site ban
[3:35:43.660 --> 3:35:47.980]  Even though you are the opposite of a porn site. You are a christian site
[3:35:48.460 --> 3:35:53.180]  But this is what pinterest is doing which just goes to show you that all these tech platforms
[3:35:53.180 --> 3:35:57.500]  They don't need a reason. They don't even pretend to have a reason
[3:35:57.740 --> 3:36:05.340]  They don't even pretend to operate in the world of rationality or facts or cause and effect or logic or anything of the kind
[3:36:05.660 --> 3:36:07.660]  They're just making it all up as they go along
[3:36:08.140 --> 3:36:14.060]  And let me tell you something folks as long as we allow them to continue to steamroll our rights
[3:36:14.460 --> 3:36:17.100]  They will they will do so every day. They can get away with it
[3:36:17.100 --> 3:36:24.140]  The only way to stop these people is to force them to stop and by force them. I mean through government regulation
[3:36:24.780 --> 3:36:26.460]  antitrust action
[3:36:26.460 --> 3:36:28.460]  lawsuits attorneys general
[3:36:29.340 --> 3:36:32.140]  We need the texas ag paxton
[3:36:32.620 --> 3:36:37.260]  To go after facebook to go after twitter to go after pinterest and so on
[3:36:37.980 --> 3:36:41.820]  But check out a couple minutes of footage here from james oakie project veritas
[3:36:41.820 --> 3:36:48.460]  And he's one of the best journalists in america best independent investigators alive today. He's doing amazing work
[3:36:48.860 --> 3:36:53.100]  Just constantly but check this out. See what he found out about pinterest. Go ahead and roll that
[3:36:54.060 --> 3:36:56.060]  One person can make all the difference
[3:36:56.300 --> 3:36:58.300]  One person really
[3:36:58.380 --> 3:37:04.380]  Can let people know one one person can bring transparency to big tech
[3:37:04.380 --> 3:37:12.300]  Last year an individual from facebook approached us and gave us documents inside the company appearing to show
[3:37:12.700 --> 3:37:16.220]  How facebook deboosts content for political reasons
[3:37:16.780 --> 3:37:22.620]  Facebook was forced to respond her story inspired many like her to come forward
[3:37:23.340 --> 3:37:26.380]  And now another insider has bravely stepped forward
[3:37:27.100 --> 3:37:29.100]  leaking documents
[3:37:29.100 --> 3:37:34.460]  That show how big tech appears to have thrown its hat into the political debate
[3:37:35.020 --> 3:37:42.300]  Now the documents we've obtained raised serious questions about whether these companies are neutral platforms or publishers
[3:37:42.700 --> 3:37:44.700]  With an editorial agenda
[3:37:44.700 --> 3:37:46.380]  thanks
[3:37:46.380 --> 3:37:52.220]  I work at pinterest and we're talking about some of the documents that i uncovered that
[3:37:52.780 --> 3:37:55.340]  People need to know about inside pinterest
[3:37:55.340 --> 3:38:02.140]  Like facebook and twitter pinterest is another social media company where millions of users share pictures on their profiles
[3:38:02.540 --> 3:38:11.420]  Just back in april pinterest joined its larger contemporaries on the stock market with an ipo evaluation of 12.7 billion dollars
[3:38:11.980 --> 3:38:17.020]  A pinterest insider shed light on some activities that shareholders may want to know about
[3:38:17.660 --> 3:38:19.660]  So what are we looking at here?
[3:38:19.660 --> 3:38:27.660]  It seems to be a a bunch of xxx and porn websites and then and then there appears to be the live-action website
[3:38:27.740 --> 3:38:30.220]  What what are we looking at here? You're looking at pins
[3:38:31.100 --> 3:38:33.100]  with domains that are blocked
[3:38:34.540 --> 3:38:38.860]  Any domain on the porn block list? You can't make a pin like that
[3:38:39.500 --> 3:38:43.820]  And I happened to discover this because of a slack thread
[3:38:44.460 --> 3:38:48.620]  uh talking about pro-life content and somebody happened to notice that
[3:38:48.620 --> 3:38:51.900]  live-action.org was blocked and so
[3:38:52.700 --> 3:38:55.100]  I was pretty surprised and I went to
[3:38:55.820 --> 3:38:59.980]  Our porn domain block list and then sure enough I found live-action on there
[3:39:00.140 --> 3:39:05.500]  Live-action is a group founded by lila rose that tries to educate people about the pro-life movement
[3:39:05.900 --> 3:39:11.100]  Many of their projects focus on detailing medical procedures used by abortion providers
[3:39:11.660 --> 3:39:15.340]  The documents the pinterest insider gave us appear to show code
[3:39:15.340 --> 3:39:20.700]  Guidelines and the actual employees making censorship decisions
[3:39:21.100 --> 3:39:27.020]  Including specific actions taken against live-action. Why did why do you think they're targeting live-action?
[3:39:27.740 --> 3:39:33.020]  I think because live-action is effective and I think they're seeing increased pressure
[3:39:33.740 --> 3:39:35.740]  in the abortion rate
[3:39:35.820 --> 3:39:42.700]  What is happening to live-action.org on pinterest live-action.org was added to a porn block list
[3:39:42.700 --> 3:39:49.900]  That means that if you try to make a pin that links to live-action.org you won't be able to allow it to pin won't be created
[3:39:50.860 --> 3:39:52.860]  And who is megan mclellan?
[3:39:53.100 --> 3:39:56.700]  Megan works on the trust and safety team and on government operations
[3:39:57.340 --> 3:40:02.460]  And she was the one who added live-action.org to the porn domain
[3:40:02.620 --> 3:40:07.740]  All right, so that's kind of a little bit of a preview of that video from project veritas
[3:40:07.740 --> 3:40:10.220]  I encourage you to go to their website and view the rest of it
[3:40:10.220 --> 3:40:13.420]  They're a fascinating interview with a whistleblower from inside
[3:40:13.980 --> 3:40:17.180]  Pinterest and I don't know if you caught it during that clip there
[3:40:17.180 --> 3:40:20.620]  But zero hedge was also on that list and no doubt many other
[3:40:21.340 --> 3:40:26.060]  Conservatives are just independent, you know pro-liberty type of websites are probably on that list as well
[3:40:26.780 --> 3:40:30.140]  Now here's what's fascinating about what's happening and where this is all going
[3:40:30.860 --> 3:40:33.740]  We know that google facebook twitter
[3:40:34.780 --> 3:40:36.780]  You know even not just pinterest, but
[3:40:36.780 --> 3:40:45.660]  Even wikipedia for that matter. We know that these organizations different search engines different tech platforms are all biased against individual liberty
[3:40:45.660 --> 3:40:50.700]  They're biased against conservatism. They're biased against christians. In fact, they're biased against natural health
[3:40:50.940 --> 3:40:53.500]  By the way and nutrition and the things that I tend to cover
[3:40:54.540 --> 3:40:55.740]  We know
[3:40:55.740 --> 3:40:58.540]  That this is all going to come out in lawsuits
[3:40:59.100 --> 3:41:01.820]  There are lawsuits underway right now against google for example
[3:41:01.820 --> 3:41:07.500]  And in those lawsuits, there's a process called discovery during discovery google will have to turn over information
[3:41:08.460 --> 3:41:12.860]  That will frankly show how they are carrying out this bias
[3:41:13.820 --> 3:41:16.540]  As this emerges, it's going to become apparent
[3:41:17.020 --> 3:41:24.060]  To lawmakers in washington dc and regulators and more members of the public that the tech giants have been running a
[3:41:24.700 --> 3:41:25.820]  collusion
[3:41:25.820 --> 3:41:28.620]  racketeering conspiracy for many many years
[3:41:28.620 --> 3:41:35.180]  Reco act violations are all over the place with these tech giants and in my opinion
[3:41:35.500 --> 3:41:42.940]  They should be prosecuted under the reco act, which of course is the law that was created in order to go after organized crime
[3:41:43.820 --> 3:41:47.660]  Well google in my opinion and other tech giants are engaged in
[3:41:48.300 --> 3:41:51.500]  organized racketeering and all we need is
[3:41:52.140 --> 3:41:54.540]  Someone in washington dc with enough backbone
[3:41:54.540 --> 3:41:59.740]  To go after these tech giants and if you had to if I had to take a guess of when that might happen
[3:41:59.740 --> 3:42:06.620]  It would be after trump gets reelected. In fact trump's reelection in 2020 will be
[3:42:07.180 --> 3:42:10.780]  a milestone for new action for trump to
[3:42:11.660 --> 3:42:17.820]  To really try to unwind the tech giant collusion and the deep state elements that are still there
[3:42:17.980 --> 3:42:22.300]  There are many of them because at that point trump does not have to get reelected again
[3:42:22.300 --> 3:42:26.060]  You can only serve two terms remember so trump's second term
[3:42:26.780 --> 3:42:29.660]  Just like reagan's second term would be his most powerful
[3:42:30.220 --> 3:42:37.260]  And the fact that we're seeing this coming out now about all the censorship all this bias anti conservative anti christian
[3:42:37.820 --> 3:42:39.820]  anti life bias
[3:42:39.820 --> 3:42:46.860]  This is going to flip against the tech giants once trump wins a second term. That's my prediction. Stay with us one more segment ahead
[3:42:46.860 --> 3:42:52.860]  We'll be right back.
[3:42:53.500 --> 3:42:57.260]  info wars the most banned network in the world
[3:42:57.660 --> 3:43:03.980]  So the info wars model is a self fulfilling self supporting structure that is promoting free press and free speech
[3:43:04.060 --> 3:43:07.980]  By people getting together and supporting one another and sustaining one another
[3:43:08.060 --> 3:43:12.620]  It is the only independent press of this size and scale of this public reach
[3:43:12.620 --> 3:43:17.340]  It is the one model that says here's a way to have a self supporting self sustaining
[3:43:17.580 --> 3:43:23.900]  Self-structured little de democratic structure that because the audience determines what content goes up the audience determines
[3:43:24.060 --> 3:43:29.500]  What audience is ultimately reached by their choices and supporting info wars and it's all because the audience spends there
[3:43:29.500 --> 3:43:35.340]  Whatever it is, whether it's five dollars or fifty dollars a month on products that they like and that they want that actually compete with the
[3:43:35.500 --> 3:43:40.460]  Corporate driven model and the ability to do that and at the same time support press support speech
[3:43:40.460 --> 3:43:45.100]  Support letting the audience choose what news they want to see and what views they want to hold
[3:43:45.180 --> 3:43:52.060]  And it's the ultimate american democratic expression and experiment and it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets
[3:43:55.020 --> 3:43:59.100]  Mike in new jersey you're on the air. Thanks for calling Mike. You are the man alex
[3:43:59.100 --> 3:44:03.340]  I'm so glad to be talking to you. I'm so excited. I'm such a big fan ever since I've been listening
[3:44:03.420 --> 3:44:08.060]  I've been buying your products. I got to do a shout out for the bone broth the bone broth
[3:44:08.060 --> 3:44:10.060]  The bone broth
[3:44:10.300 --> 3:44:12.300]  The bone broth
[3:44:12.940 --> 3:44:17.340]  Tastes like tastes like um, great milkshake. You know, if you just add it to milk
[3:44:17.580 --> 3:44:22.700]  It tastes like oval team. It tastes like oval team. It tastes like oval team. Like good
[3:44:23.660 --> 3:44:29.180]  I feel great since I've been taking it. My daughter uses the bubblegum fluoride three toothpaste
[3:44:29.500 --> 3:44:35.100]  Um, I've used the uh, supermail vitality a host of other products. So thank you so much for that as well

[3:46:03.340 --> 3:46:05.340]  By leaps and by bounds
[3:46:05.660 --> 3:46:11.900]  The number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements
[3:46:11.900 --> 3:46:17.500]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeine and other chemicals
[3:46:17.740 --> 3:46:22.300]  That sure get you a quick boost but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects
[3:46:22.460 --> 3:46:26.300]  We have developed hands down from our research the most powerful
[3:46:26.940 --> 3:46:31.100]  Healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world
[3:46:31.820 --> 3:46:37.580]  There's nothing else like it must experience it. It is a total game changer and it comes in easy to use
[3:46:37.580 --> 3:46:43.900]  Package to mix it with fruges or water whatever you'd like warning though. It's very very strong. It lasts 10 hours
[3:46:44.300 --> 3:46:50.540]  So take a half pack the first time you take it because turbo force is named turbo force because it will take you into overdrive
[3:46:51.020 --> 3:46:53.020]  turbo force and enforce live com
[3:46:57.100 --> 3:46:59.740]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[3:46:59.740 --> 3:47:16.140]  Big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers? Well, so does he it's mike adams
[3:47:19.580 --> 3:47:25.900]  Well, joe biden has promised to cure cancer if he's elected president
[3:47:25.900 --> 3:47:34.700]  Uh, didn't al gore say he invented the internet at one point. Well, if al gore invented the internet and joe biden cures cancer then
[3:47:36.220 --> 3:47:38.540]  Wow, what's going to happen in the cancer industry?
[3:47:39.180 --> 3:47:40.700]  joe
[3:47:40.700 --> 3:47:45.180]  You know the truth about this situation is that the cancer industry doesn't want a cure for cancer
[3:47:45.740 --> 3:47:49.980]  joe biden probably knows that as much as anybody the other truth is that
[3:47:50.540 --> 3:47:53.660]  We've had cancer cures for a very long time. They're all suppressed
[3:47:53.660 --> 3:47:58.940]  They're all called fake medicine or fake science or fake news by the establishment
[3:47:59.180 --> 3:48:08.060]  Remember the mainstream media slash legacy media is funded in part by the cancer industry and the drug cartel revenues
[3:48:08.860 --> 3:48:15.740]  They depend on cancer and repeat cancer the number one side effect of chemotherapy is more cancer
[3:48:16.380 --> 3:48:17.420]  so
[3:48:17.420 --> 3:48:19.260]  Hey, it's repeat business for them
[3:48:19.260 --> 3:48:22.860]  You keep coming back and you have another cancer every two years every three years until you're dead
[3:48:22.860 --> 3:48:26.860]  But until that day comes they can exploit your body for profits
[3:48:27.340 --> 3:48:32.860]  Chemotherapy profits and it also turns out that you don't even have to have cancer to be diagnosed with cancer
[3:48:33.420 --> 3:48:36.380]  There are so many false positives from mammograms
[3:48:37.340 --> 3:48:42.220]  The studies show that nine women are harmed by mammograms for every one woman who is helped
[3:48:43.020 --> 3:48:45.260]  mammograms emit ionizing radiation
[3:48:46.140 --> 3:48:48.140]  That's radiation that causes cancer by the way
[3:48:48.700 --> 3:48:50.700]  And it irradiates a woman's heart
[3:48:50.700 --> 3:48:52.700]  breasts and lungs
[3:48:53.580 --> 3:48:57.180]  So if they don't find cancer on any given year when you're having mammograms
[3:48:57.580 --> 3:49:01.580]  If they give you enough mammograms, they will sooner or later find cancer because they caused it
[3:49:02.780 --> 3:49:05.100]  So joe biden running around. Yeah, we're going to cure cancer
[3:49:06.140 --> 3:49:12.220]  He obviously hasn't checked with the cancer industry the cancer corporations because they don't want to cure cancer
[3:49:12.380 --> 3:49:19.340]  Do you think the american cancer society wants to give up its position as the most lucrative the wealthiest nonprofit in the world?
[3:49:19.340 --> 3:49:21.340]  That rides on the back of a disease
[3:49:22.700 --> 3:49:28.300]  That doesn't even really do anything to solve cancer or to understand the causes of cancer
[3:49:29.820 --> 3:49:31.820]  Joe biden won't cure cancer
[3:49:32.220 --> 3:49:34.220]  And al gore didn't invent the internet
[3:49:37.740 --> 3:49:39.740]  But they're going to keep trying, uh, okay
[3:49:39.820 --> 3:49:46.060]  Related to cancer. Here's here's the news from bloomberg drug to replace chemotherapy may reshape cancer care
[3:49:46.060 --> 3:49:52.460]  The reason I bring this up is because this article in the second paragraph check this out. It admits
[3:49:53.420 --> 3:49:55.980]  That modern-day cancer treatments are toxic
[3:49:56.380 --> 3:50:01.820]  Quote a class of drugs is emerging that can attack cancer cells in the body without damaging surrounding healthy ones
[3:50:02.220 --> 3:50:07.740]  Whoa, wait a minute. You mean to tell me that all these years that I've been reporting chemotherapy
[3:50:08.140 --> 3:50:11.820]  Is dangerous to healthy cells that that wasn't fake news after all
[3:50:11.820 --> 3:50:19.260]  Amazing bloomberg is now confirming what natural news has been reporting for years
[3:50:19.820 --> 3:50:25.740]  Now this new class of drugs here it is. It's called adc's or antibody drug conjugates
[3:50:26.540 --> 3:50:30.700]  These are not chemicals. It's not chemotherapy. It's nothing of the kind
[3:50:31.580 --> 3:50:37.020]  In fact, it uses the body's own immune system to attack cancer cells in a targeted fashion
[3:50:37.580 --> 3:50:39.580]  While not attacking healthy cells
[3:50:39.580 --> 3:50:44.460]  In fact, you can't even call this chemotherapy and you can't even really call it a vaccine either
[3:50:45.020 --> 3:50:49.820]  It's really a way to harness the body's own natural immune capabilities
[3:50:50.300 --> 3:50:52.460]  But here's the big secret that they probably won't tell you
[3:50:53.340 --> 3:50:57.100]  This class of compounds are talking about antibody drug conjugates
[3:50:57.900 --> 3:51:04.460]  Healthy people make similar molecules all the time naturally for free in their own blood
[3:51:04.460 --> 3:51:12.460]  You if you have a healthy diet, and you've got good vitamin d and you're not poisoning yourself with toxic chemicals all the time
[3:51:13.020 --> 3:51:17.660]  And just have good nutrition. Maybe some superfoods. Maybe some good supplements that have proven
[3:51:18.060 --> 3:51:23.820]  Anti-cancer potential even anti-cancer foods like cruciferous vegetables or garlic for that matter
[3:51:24.380 --> 3:51:26.620]  All these things help your body build
[3:51:26.860 --> 3:51:30.060]  Anti-cancer nutrients that are then circulated in your own blood
[3:51:30.060 --> 3:51:37.420]  And those anti-cancer nutrients or molecules, you might say work in conjunction with your immune system to target cancer cells
[3:51:38.380 --> 3:51:40.380]  You can make this for free
[3:51:40.940 --> 3:51:48.780]  In your own body just by eating better by eating more fresh produce by avoiding cancer-causing foods
[3:51:49.340 --> 3:51:54.300]  And if you were to ask my opinion, I am a food scientist. I do run a food science lab
[3:51:54.300 --> 3:52:00.300]  I say the number one thing to avoid is sodium nitrite in processed meats. You'll find it in most
[3:52:00.940 --> 3:52:02.940]  Bacon and pepperoni and lunch meats
[3:52:03.500 --> 3:52:10.700]  Sandwich ham things like that even beef jerky, but there are more companies now making nitrite-free
[3:52:11.100 --> 3:52:17.900]  Processed meats or frozen meats. So if you're going to eat those meats go with nitrite free. Sodium nitrite, by the way
[3:52:18.540 --> 3:52:20.540]  When it combines with the
[3:52:20.860 --> 3:52:22.860]  Acid in your stomach
[3:52:22.860 --> 3:52:28.460]  A little bit of hydrochloric acid. It forms a class of compounds called nitrosamines
[3:52:29.020 --> 3:52:32.860]  Nitrosamines are so dangerous. They cause cancer at such an accelerated rate
[3:52:33.420 --> 3:52:39.340]  That researchers who want to give lab rats cancer so they can study cancer drugs and things like that
[3:52:39.580 --> 3:52:41.580]  They inject the rats with nitrosamines
[3:52:42.380 --> 3:52:44.380]  That's how powerful it is at causing cancer
[3:52:44.700 --> 3:52:50.060]  If you eat sodium nitrite in processed meat products, you are making nitrosamines in your stomach
[3:52:50.060 --> 3:52:54.140]  And you're absorbing cancer causing chemicals into your blood
[3:52:54.940 --> 3:52:56.940]  So you can you can choose a path here
[3:52:57.580 --> 3:53:02.540]  And that's why I'm so fascinated by the fact that this is being published now that hey, you don't need chemotherapy
[3:53:03.180 --> 3:53:05.180]  Something better is coming along
[3:53:05.260 --> 3:53:10.300]  This research has found that your body's own immune system. They call it a drug of drug conjugates
[3:53:10.620 --> 3:53:15.100]  It's really just a drug that's partnering with your immune system. Your immune system knows how to do this
[3:53:15.420 --> 3:53:18.780]  Your immune system is doing the work here. The thing is you don't need the drug
[3:53:18.780 --> 3:53:24.300]  You can you can have your immune system do this naturally every day for virtually free
[3:53:24.460 --> 3:53:29.020]  And you don't have to pay royalties to some drug company. You don't even have to go see a doctor to eat healthy
[3:53:29.660 --> 3:53:32.860]  You don't have to see a doctor to go get anti-cancer foods at the grocery store
[3:53:33.900 --> 3:53:36.540]  And they're cheap they're cheap compared to getting cancer
[3:53:36.940 --> 3:53:39.660]  They're cheap compared to the toxic effects of chemotherapy
[3:53:40.220 --> 3:53:43.100]  Having your hair fall out having your muscles fall apart
[3:53:43.100 --> 3:53:50.300]  Vomiting all day can't even eat your brain gets all foggy your kidneys are damaged. Those are the side effects of chemotherapy
[3:53:51.260 --> 3:53:56.940]  But those are the things that the cancer industry loves because that causes repeat business
[3:53:57.580 --> 3:54:01.020]  More cancer come on back for round two of chemotherapy
[3:54:01.740 --> 3:54:06.620]  And as I said in some cases, you don't even have to have cancer. There was a guy named dr. Fareed Fata
[3:54:07.500 --> 3:54:12.780]  In practicing in michigan arrested by the FBI. He's currently serving. I think 24 years in prison
[3:54:12.780 --> 3:54:14.380]  cancer doctor
[3:54:14.380 --> 3:54:18.460]  Every person who walked through his door and he served primarily a black community
[3:54:19.020 --> 3:54:21.020]  Every person who walked through his door
[3:54:21.660 --> 3:54:23.660]  was diagnosed with cancer
[3:54:23.980 --> 3:54:26.860]  And he said, oh my god, you have cancer. You're going to die in six months
[3:54:26.860 --> 3:54:29.100]  If you don't start the chemo drip right now today
[3:54:29.580 --> 3:54:33.660]  And of course his clinic sold the chemotherapy drugs at high markups
[3:54:34.620 --> 3:54:35.660]  and
[3:54:35.660 --> 3:54:39.020]  He just faked a cancer diagnosis for everybody
[3:54:39.020 --> 3:54:44.300]  And put them all in chairs and he had a whole factory a whole warehouse going
[3:54:45.020 --> 3:54:46.060]  of
[3:54:46.060 --> 3:54:52.220]  Cancer chemotherapy drips into people's veins collecting Medicare Medicaid private insurance money
[3:54:52.700 --> 3:54:57.900]  And the only reason this was ever discovered is because an insider blew the whistle and called the FBI and said, hey
[3:54:58.220 --> 3:55:01.100]  Something's going on here. How come everybody has cancer?
[3:55:02.380 --> 3:55:04.380]  Turns out they didn't have cancer
[3:55:04.460 --> 3:55:06.460]  The whole thing was a scam
[3:55:06.460 --> 3:55:09.180]  And i'm here to tell you that this guy dr. Fata
[3:55:09.580 --> 3:55:14.380]  He's only one of probably thousands of oncologists across america today
[3:55:14.620 --> 3:55:20.060]  Who are pulling the same scam and the same fraud the same criminal behavior, but they haven't been caught yet
[3:55:20.300 --> 3:55:22.140]  They haven't been arrested
[3:55:22.140 --> 3:55:26.620]  And you don't see that covered almost anywhere in the legacy media once again
[3:55:26.620 --> 3:55:30.380]  It's only the independent alternative media that you get these stories
[3:55:30.380 --> 3:55:33.100]  There was some coverage in the mainstream media, but not nearly enough
[3:55:33.100 --> 3:55:39.180]  They didn't want people to not trust your cancer doctor, you know, because you're supposed to walk in there and say, please doctor
[3:55:39.180 --> 3:55:45.500]  Tell me what should I poison my body with today so that I can be cancer-free and the doctor's supposed to say
[3:55:45.900 --> 3:55:49.660]  Sit in that chair put this needle in your veins take these drugs
[3:55:50.140 --> 3:55:53.420]  And then we'll build Medicare for you and then you might live
[3:55:54.220 --> 3:55:56.220]  You talk about fear mongering
[3:55:56.300 --> 3:56:01.100]  You talk about fake science and fake medicine doesn't get any worse than the cancer industry
[3:56:01.100 --> 3:56:05.980]  That's why I always just laugh when they attack, you know vitamins and they attack natural health. Are you kidding me?
[3:56:06.860 --> 3:56:08.860]  Cancer industry is a massive fraud
[3:56:09.500 --> 3:56:15.340]  It's it's in many ways. It's worse than the vaccine industry, which is also another kind of fraud in its own way
[3:56:16.460 --> 3:56:21.100]  But this is this is what's happening all around the world. Okay. One more thing on that speaking of vaccines
[3:56:22.140 --> 3:56:27.900]  American Medical Association says that children should be able to consent
[3:56:27.900 --> 3:56:32.620]  To vaccines that their parents oppose so think about it if your parents don't want
[3:56:33.580 --> 3:56:35.580]  If you're a child and your parents don't want you to get these
[3:56:35.820 --> 3:56:43.660]  MMR vaccines or other vaccines the AMA wants children to be able to sign consent forms and say yes inject me
[3:56:44.860 --> 3:56:48.620]  And you know why because of course the schools are very good at brainwashing children
[3:56:49.500 --> 3:56:52.380]  This is why democrats want 10 year olds to vote
[3:56:53.180 --> 3:56:56.860]  Because 10 year olds don't know much of anything about the way the world works
[3:56:56.860 --> 3:56:58.700]  But
[3:56:58.700 --> 3:56:59.980]  This is the system
[3:56:59.980 --> 3:57:07.420]  They want children to consent to the medical police state or to consent to the the fake news establishment
[3:57:07.740 --> 3:57:11.100]  They want children to run the world because they can control the minds of children
[3:57:11.340 --> 3:57:15.580]  But not the minds of adults not the minds of people who are aware informed
[3:57:16.460 --> 3:57:18.700]  intelligent and people who frankly are
[3:57:19.980 --> 3:57:23.100]  Have some connection to god some connection to
[3:57:23.100 --> 3:57:25.740]  The teachings of god
[3:57:27.260 --> 3:57:32.460]  And that's what we're here to do is to help you stay awake alive aware and get closer to god
[3:57:32.540 --> 3:57:36.060]  You know, I mean practice the principles that matter. Let's have a more moral
[3:57:36.620 --> 3:57:41.340]  Society a more faith-based society would be good. Thanks for watching today. Mike Adams here. Take care
[3:57:43.340 --> 3:57:51.180]  Recent studies and reports have shown that pipes and plumbing are getting clogged and backed up
[3:57:51.180 --> 3:57:57.340]  With human waste and debris. This is from people flushing things that aren't meant to be flushed
[3:57:57.900 --> 3:58:03.020]  Like baby wipes and feminine products and safe sex products
[3:58:03.180 --> 3:58:07.260]  And so this is resulting in pipes being backed up and clogged
[3:58:07.900 --> 3:58:13.420]  Well, just like plumbing gets clogged and just like pipes get clogged the human body gets clogged
[3:58:13.580 --> 3:58:16.460]  Just like that and you may be experiencing backup too
