[00:00.000 --> 00:04.000]  I hereby declare this to be an unlawful assembly.
[00:04.000 --> 00:08.000]  I order all those assembled to immediately disperse.
[00:08.000 --> 00:11.000]  It's a military mission in North St. Louis.
[00:11.000 --> 00:13.000]  Heavily armored vehicles are rolling into town.
[00:13.000 --> 00:16.000]  And don't be alarmed if you see those over the next seven days,
[00:16.000 --> 00:18.000]  rolling through your neighborhood.
[00:18.000 --> 00:21.000]  If you see military helicopters flying low over Minneapolis,
[00:21.000 --> 00:22.000]  do not be alarmed.
[00:22.000 --> 00:25.000]  Guns will be taken, no one will be able to be armed.
[00:25.000 --> 00:26.000]  We will take all weapons.
[00:26.000 --> 00:28.000]  Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in.
[00:28.000 --> 00:31.000]  Just really brainwash people into thinking about guns
[00:31.000 --> 00:32.000]  in a vastly different way.
[00:32.000 --> 00:35.000]  Enough, enough, enough, enough.
[00:35.000 --> 00:37.000]  The Department of Homeland Security
[00:37.000 --> 00:40.000]  is apparently on a huge ammo buying spree.
[00:40.000 --> 00:44.000]  It comes out to like 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition.
[00:44.000 --> 00:46.000]  And as case late news 12, Jeff Farrell discovered
[00:46.000 --> 00:48.000]  that clergy would help the government
[00:48.000 --> 00:51.000]  with potentially their biggest problem, us.
[00:51.000 --> 00:53.000]  So part of it is we have to break through
[00:53.000 --> 00:56.000]  our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents
[00:56.000 --> 00:58.000]  or kids belong to their families
[00:58.000 --> 01:00.000]  and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[01:00.000 --> 01:03.000]  If you've got a business, you didn't build that.
[01:03.000 --> 01:05.000]  Somebody else made that happen.
[01:05.000 --> 01:09.000]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids
[01:09.000 --> 01:12.000]  according to two new studies in the journal Pediatrics.
[01:12.000 --> 01:14.000]  Black Hawk choppers soaring through the night sky,
[01:14.000 --> 01:17.000]  but this is only a drill.
[01:17.000 --> 01:20.000]  Heavily armed officers in Watertown search for the suspect.
[01:20.000 --> 01:28.000]  House to house.
[01:28.000 --> 01:31.000]  It's a joint military training exercise
[01:31.000 --> 01:34.000]  involving local police, also military.
[01:34.000 --> 01:37.000]  I am in my apartment, sir.
[01:37.000 --> 01:38.000]  I am inside.
[01:38.000 --> 01:40.000]  I have two words for you.
[01:40.000 --> 01:42.000]  Predator gloves.
[01:42.000 --> 01:47.000]  You will never see it coming.
[01:47.000 --> 01:50.000]  The dramatic scene played out in front of our cameras,
[01:50.000 --> 01:52.000]  parents grabbing their children and running
[01:52.000 --> 01:55.000]  after spending the night hunkering in their houses
[01:55.000 --> 01:57.000]  and then finding themselves face-to-face
[01:57.000 --> 02:00.000]  with the muzzle of a SWAT officer's rifle.
[02:00.000 --> 02:02.000]  They let them in the area, they told them they could come in
[02:02.000 --> 02:04.000]  and now they're coming in like they're trespassers,
[02:04.000 --> 02:05.000]  punching and shoving people.
[02:05.000 --> 02:07.000]  We're not turning our guns in
[02:07.000 --> 02:10.000]  and we're not running and we're not backing down
[02:10.000 --> 02:14.000]  if you want a confrontation.
[02:14.000 --> 02:17.000]  We are on the march.
[02:17.000 --> 02:19.000]  The Empire is on the run.
[02:19.000 --> 02:22.000]  Live from the Infowars.com studios,
[02:22.000 --> 02:24.000]  it's Alex Jones.
[02:24.000 --> 02:28.000]  There's a revolution in there, my girl.
[02:28.000 --> 02:31.000]  You better stop too far.
[02:31.000 --> 02:34.000]  It feels so well that when we have to live,
[02:34.000 --> 02:39.000]  we'll all hate them for any harm.
[02:39.000 --> 02:41.000]  The potential for the disastrous rise
[02:41.000 --> 02:43.000]  of misplaced power exists
[02:43.000 --> 02:45.000]  and we'll persist.
[02:45.000 --> 02:49.000]  This is the heart of 1776.
[02:57.000 --> 02:59.000]  You can't fight the city hall.
[02:59.000 --> 03:01.000]  You have no taxes.
[03:01.000 --> 03:03.000]  No tonnet-out politics or religion.
[03:03.000 --> 03:05.000]  This is all the equivalent of enemy propaganda
[03:05.000 --> 03:07.000]  rolling across the picket line.
[03:07.000 --> 03:09.000]  Lay down, G.I., lay down, G.I.
[03:09.000 --> 03:11.000]  We saw it all through the 20th century
[03:11.000 --> 03:13.000]  and now in the 21st century,
[03:13.000 --> 03:15.000]  it's time to stand up and realize
[03:15.000 --> 03:17.000]  that we should not allow ourselves
[03:17.000 --> 03:19.000]  to be crammed into this rat maze.
[03:19.000 --> 03:21.000]  We should not submit to dehumanization.
[03:21.000 --> 03:23.000]  I don't know about you,
[03:23.000 --> 03:25.000]  but I'm concerned with what's happening in this world.
[03:25.000 --> 03:27.000]  I'm concerned with the structure.
[03:27.000 --> 03:29.000]  I'm concerned with the systems of control,
[03:29.000 --> 03:31.000]  those that control my life
[03:31.000 --> 03:33.000]  and those that seek to control even more.
[03:33.000 --> 03:35.000]  I want freedom.
[03:35.000 --> 03:37.000]  That's what I want and that's what you should want.
[03:37.000 --> 03:39.000]  It's up to each and every one of us
[03:39.000 --> 03:41.000]  to have some of the freedom,
[03:41.000 --> 03:43.000]  the hatred, the envy,
[03:43.000 --> 03:45.000]  and yes, the insecurities
[03:45.000 --> 03:47.000]  because that is the central mode of control.
[03:47.000 --> 03:49.000]  Make us feel pathetic, small,
[03:49.000 --> 03:51.000]  so we'll willingly give up our sovereignty,
[03:51.000 --> 03:53.000]  our liberty, our destiny.
[03:53.000 --> 03:55.000]  We have got to realize
[03:55.000 --> 03:57.000]  that we're being conditioned on a mass scale.
[03:57.000 --> 03:59.000]  Start challenging this corporate slave state.
[03:59.000 --> 04:01.000]  The 21st century is going to be a new century.
[04:01.000 --> 04:03.000]  Not the century of slavery,
[04:03.000 --> 04:05.000]  not the century of lies
[04:05.000 --> 04:07.000]  that you can do without giving us
[04:07.000 --> 04:09.000]  the masses of statism
[04:09.000 --> 04:11.000]  and all the rest of the modes of control.
[04:11.000 --> 04:13.000]  It's going to be the age of humankind
[04:13.000 --> 04:15.000]  standing up for something pure and something right.
[04:15.000 --> 04:17.000]  What a bunch of garbage,
[04:17.000 --> 04:19.000]  liberal, Democrat, and conservative Republicans.
[04:19.000 --> 04:21.000]  It's all there to control
[04:21.000 --> 04:23.000]  the two sides of the same coin.
[04:23.000 --> 04:25.000]  Two management teams
[04:25.000 --> 04:27.000]  getting for control, the CEO job
[04:27.000 --> 04:29.000]  of slavery incorporated.
[04:29.000 --> 04:31.000]  The truth is out there in front of you
[04:31.000 --> 04:33.000]  that they lay out this buffet of lies.
[04:33.000 --> 04:35.000]  I'm sick of it and I'm not going to take a bite out of it.
[04:35.000 --> 04:37.000]  Do you got me?
[04:39.000 --> 04:41.000]  Humankind is too good.
[04:41.000 --> 04:43.000]  We're not a bunch of underachievers.
[04:43.000 --> 04:45.000]  We're going to stand up
[04:45.000 --> 04:47.000]  and we're going to be human beings.
[04:47.000 --> 04:49.000]  We're going to be real things,
[04:49.000 --> 04:51.000]  the things that matter, creativity,
[04:51.000 --> 04:53.000]  and the dynamic human spirit
[04:53.000 --> 04:55.000]  that refuses to submit.
[04:55.000 --> 04:57.000]  Well, that's it. That's all I've got to say.
[04:57.000 --> 05:07.000]  Thank you for watching.
[05:27.000 --> 05:37.000]  I'll see you next time.

[06:59.000 --> 07:01.000]  Hi, folks. Alex Jones here
[07:01.000 --> 07:03.000]  with some important information.
[07:03.000 --> 07:05.000]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk
[07:05.000 --> 07:07.000]  and his team of patriots over at
[07:07.000 --> 07:09.000]  MyPatriot Supply. Several years ago,
[07:09.000 --> 07:11.000]  Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment
[07:11.000 --> 07:13.000]  frustrated with the direction this country was headed
[07:13.000 --> 07:15.000]  and the charlatans willing to sell us out
[07:15.000 --> 07:17.000]  for a quick buck. Deciding to take action,
[07:17.000 --> 07:19.000]  a company run by patriots
[07:19.000 --> 07:21.000]  for patriots was born.
[07:21.000 --> 07:23.000]  MyPatriot Supply has never taken
[07:23.000 --> 07:25.000]  a loan or accepted outside funding.
[07:25.000 --> 07:27.000]  They now operate two distribution facilities
[07:27.000 --> 07:29.000]  and employ over 50
[07:29.000 --> 07:31.000]  hard-working American men and women.
[07:31.000 --> 07:33.000]  It is rare to find companies who practice
[07:33.000 --> 07:35.000]  what they preach, and that's why I
[07:35.000 --> 07:37.000]  stock my pantry with high-quality
[07:37.000 --> 07:39.000]  storable foods from MyPatriot Supply.
[07:39.000 --> 07:41.000]  Go to MyPatriotSupply.com
[07:41.000 --> 07:43.000]  or special offers
[07:43.000 --> 07:45.000]  on emergency food storage
[07:45.000 --> 07:47.000]  or call their preparedness specialist
[07:47.000 --> 07:51.000]  at 866-229-0927.

[08:07.000 --> 08:09.000]  Mainstream media. Government cover-ups.
[08:09.000 --> 08:11.000]  You want answers?
[08:11.000 --> 08:13.000]  Well, so does he.
[08:13.000 --> 08:15.000]  He's Alex Jones
[08:15.000 --> 08:17.000]  on the GCN Radio Network.
[08:17.000 --> 08:19.000]  And now, live from
[08:19.000 --> 08:21.000]  Austin, Texas,
[08:21.000 --> 08:23.000]  Alex Jones.
[08:23.000 --> 08:25.000]  Well, here's the CBS
[08:25.000 --> 08:27.000]  news headline. It's one of the top
[08:27.000 --> 08:29.000]  stories in the country now,
[08:29.000 --> 08:31.000]  all because one man
[08:31.000 --> 08:33.000]  has learned as one of our listeners
[08:33.000 --> 08:35.000]  on his own Facebook site. We're getting him on
[08:35.000 --> 08:37.000]  probably in the middle of the next hour
[08:37.000 --> 08:39.000]  or the nightly news tonight.
[08:39.000 --> 08:41.000]  A gentleman during the MVP press conference
[08:41.000 --> 08:43.000]  right at the start of it
[08:43.000 --> 08:45.000]  with more than 10 million viewers they estimate
[08:45.000 --> 08:47.000]  still watching
[08:47.000 --> 08:49.000]  Matthew Mills, 30
[08:49.000 --> 08:51.000]  of New York, took over
[08:51.000 --> 08:53.000]  and simply said 9-11 was an inside job
[08:53.000 --> 08:55.000]  orchestrated by inside forces
[08:55.000 --> 08:57.000]  and the government needs to be investigated.
[08:57.000 --> 08:59.000]  And now, here's the headlines.
[08:59.000 --> 09:01.000]  MVP Malcolm Smith interrupted by
[09:01.000 --> 09:03.000]  man calling for 9-11 probe.
[09:03.000 --> 09:05.000]  The New York Times
[09:05.000 --> 09:07.000]  calls it conspiracy theorist.
[09:07.000 --> 09:09.000]  High Jack's press conference.
[09:09.000 --> 09:11.000]  No, we've proven and
[09:11.000 --> 09:13.000]  6 of the 10 commissioners have said
[09:13.000 --> 09:15.000]  that it was a cover-up.
[09:15.000 --> 09:17.000]  We know those towers were blown up.
[09:17.000 --> 09:19.000]  We know there's a cover-up.
[09:19.000 --> 09:21.000]  And someone out there, more than anybody
[09:21.000 --> 09:23.000]  other than myself,
[09:23.000 --> 09:25.000]  who's had the courage to be the tip
[09:25.000 --> 09:27.000]  of the spear exposing 9-11 truth
[09:27.000 --> 09:29.000]  until the point they won't even have him
[09:29.000 --> 09:31.000]  on places like Fox News anymore
[09:31.000 --> 09:33.000]  because he wins these debates
[09:33.000 --> 09:35.000]  bringing up tower seven is
[09:35.000 --> 09:37.000]  former Minnesota governor, best-selling
[09:37.000 --> 09:39.000]  author, host of
[09:39.000 --> 09:41.000]  conspiracy theory on true TV, now has
[09:41.000 --> 09:43.000]  his own unfiltered,
[09:43.000 --> 09:45.000]  you know, taped to air or live sometimes
[09:45.000 --> 09:47.000]  show that I've been on
[09:47.000 --> 09:49.000]  off-the-grid television
[09:49.000 --> 09:51.000]  and O-R-A-T-V
[09:51.000 --> 09:53.000]  off-the-grid
[09:53.000 --> 09:55.000]  O-R-A dot TV forward slash off-the-grid
[09:55.000 --> 09:57.000]  or just type in Jesse Ventura off-the-grid
[09:57.000 --> 09:59.000]  or type in Jesse Ventura YouTube.
[09:59.000 --> 10:01.000]  You can find it all. And this is what I love
[10:01.000 --> 10:03.000]  seeing happen. This revolution
[10:03.000 --> 10:05.000]  of individuals doing their own shows
[10:05.000 --> 10:07.000]  totally uncensored, unfiltered.
[10:07.000 --> 10:09.000]  And so we're going to talk about that. He's with us for the rest of the hour.
[10:09.000 --> 10:11.000]  Great-looking site
[10:11.000 --> 10:13.000]  Jesse Ventura off-the-grid at O-R-A
[10:13.000 --> 10:15.000]  dot TV
[10:15.000 --> 10:17.000]  just like President Planet dot TV
[10:17.000 --> 10:19.000]  and he joins us right now.
[10:19.000 --> 10:21.000]  But first, he's down in Mexico
[10:21.000 --> 10:23.000]  I want to play this clip for him
[10:23.000 --> 10:25.000]  and get his take
[10:25.000 --> 10:27.000]  on this 30-year-old Matthew Mills
[10:27.000 --> 10:29.000]  who snuck through security, infiltrated
[10:29.000 --> 10:31.000]  got on one of the employee
[10:31.000 --> 10:33.000]  buses to infiltrate to tell
[10:33.000 --> 10:35.000]  the truth, true special forces
[10:35.000 --> 10:37.000]  for the truth and America
[10:37.000 --> 10:39.000]  against this inside job, here is
[10:39.000 --> 10:41.000]  part of the clip.
[10:41.000 --> 10:43.000]  I always imagine myself making great plays
[10:43.000 --> 10:45.000]  but you never think about being MVP.
[10:47.000 --> 10:49.000]  Investigate 9-11
[10:49.000 --> 10:51.000]  9-11 was perpetrated by people
[10:51.000 --> 10:53.000]  within our own government.
[10:53.000 --> 10:55.000]  And again, that simple
[10:55.000 --> 10:57.000]  statement and then they're freaking out in their response
[10:57.000 --> 10:59.000]  all over the news last night and today
[10:59.000 --> 11:01.000]  this is all over every news channel causing
[11:01.000 --> 11:03.000]  a giant debate. It shows
[11:03.000 --> 11:05.000]  that number one their fake security is a complete fraud
[11:05.000 --> 11:07.000]  with the gunships and the groping and the checkpoints.
[11:07.000 --> 11:09.000]  Governor, great to have you back with us.
[11:09.000 --> 11:11.000]  Thanks, Alex. Great to be here.
[11:11.000 --> 11:13.000]  Geez, I watched the Super Bowl
[11:13.000 --> 11:15.000]  from off the grid. I was able
[11:15.000 --> 11:17.000]  to watch the game yesterday
[11:17.000 --> 11:19.000]  and unfortunately I went
[11:19.000 --> 11:21.000]  back home and I didn't see the
[11:21.000 --> 11:23.000]  MVP presentation.
[11:23.000 --> 11:25.000]  By the way, just for my note
[11:25.000 --> 11:27.000]  who did win the MVP?
[11:27.000 --> 11:29.000]  Who did win the MVP?
[11:29.000 --> 11:31.000]  That was Malcolm Smith of the Seahawks.
[11:31.000 --> 11:33.000]  Really? Okay.
[11:33.000 --> 11:35.000]  Well, I knew
[11:35.000 --> 11:37.000]  someone from the Seahawks that win because
[11:37.000 --> 11:39.000]  they obviously dominated the game
[11:39.000 --> 11:41.000]  and overwhelmingly wanted. They did a great job
[11:41.000 --> 11:43.000]  for Seattle, but
[11:43.000 --> 11:45.000]  that's amazing that
[11:45.000 --> 11:47.000]  somebody got that in there and that's been
[11:47.000 --> 11:49.000]  all over the news today. That's wonderful.
[11:49.000 --> 11:51.000]  I couldn't be happier.
[11:51.000 --> 11:53.000]  I tip my hat to that
[11:53.000 --> 11:55.000]  gentleman that had the courage to do that
[11:55.000 --> 11:57.000]  and get people talking and thinking
[11:57.000 --> 11:59.000]  about stuff and getting the lemmings
[11:59.000 --> 12:01.000]  to wake up up there.
[12:01.000 --> 12:03.000]  Well, it shows, Governor, as you know, the power of the individual
[12:03.000 --> 12:05.000]  as somebody
[12:05.000 --> 12:07.000]  who called national NFL
[12:07.000 --> 12:09.000]  games on television
[12:09.000 --> 12:11.000]  and also they're locally for the fans
[12:11.000 --> 12:13.000]  what was it like for you to watch this?
[12:13.000 --> 12:15.000]  I think this was one of the most boring
[12:15.000 --> 12:17.000]  Super Bowls ever and then watching
[12:17.000 --> 12:19.000]  with TSA growth people
[12:19.000 --> 12:21.000]  and the gunships
[12:21.000 --> 12:23.000]  and the snipers. This did not
[12:23.000 --> 12:25.000]  look like America. It looked like
[12:25.000 --> 12:27.000]  East Germany and Checkpoint Charlie.
[12:27.000 --> 12:29.000]  Well, that's why I do my
[12:29.000 --> 12:31.000]  show. It's the fact that
[12:31.000 --> 12:33.000]  I'm outside the grid.
[12:33.000 --> 12:35.000]  I'm outside the United States broadcasting
[12:35.000 --> 12:37.000]  in
[12:37.000 --> 12:39.000]  because the United States is getting like East
[12:39.000 --> 12:41.000]  Berlin. They're taking away
[12:41.000 --> 12:43.000]  our rights and freedoms. People need to
[12:43.000 --> 12:45.000]  understand that the Constitution and the Bill of
[12:45.000 --> 12:47.000]  Rights are there to protect
[12:47.000 --> 12:49.000]  the people against the government.
[12:49.000 --> 12:51.000]  Those are our documents that ensure
[12:51.000 --> 12:53.000]  our freedom and when the government
[12:53.000 --> 12:55.000]  starts to violate those documents
[12:55.000 --> 12:57.000]  we can't allow that to happen.
[12:57.000 --> 12:59.000]  It's that simple because that's what
[12:59.000 --> 13:01.000]  makes our country the great nation that it is.
[13:01.000 --> 13:03.000]  And for this guy
[13:03.000 --> 13:05.000]  to penetrate the Super Bowl
[13:05.000 --> 13:07.000]  and be able to stay on national TV
[13:07.000 --> 13:09.000]  9-11 was an inside
[13:09.000 --> 13:11.000]  job and now they're all up and
[13:11.000 --> 13:13.000]  outraged and irate. It'll be
[13:13.000 --> 13:15.000]  interesting to see what the end result
[13:15.000 --> 13:17.000]  for this and the backlash of this is.
[13:17.000 --> 13:19.000]  Will people become
[13:19.000 --> 13:21.000]  more aware or but you know
[13:21.000 --> 13:23.000]  they're going to try to marginalize this guy
[13:23.000 --> 13:25.000]  and say that he's some sort of nutcase naturally.
[13:25.000 --> 13:27.000]  Well, if you go up to Google
[13:27.000 --> 13:29.000]  and put a 9-11 inside job and click
[13:29.000 --> 13:31.000]  news there are literally
[13:31.000 --> 13:33.000]  thousands of articles
[13:33.000 --> 13:35.000]  all over the world TV
[13:35.000 --> 13:37.000]  they are taking what he did kind of like
[13:37.000 --> 13:39.000]  when I got on Piers Morgan and just putting
[13:39.000 --> 13:41.000]  it everywhere those 15 seconds
[13:41.000 --> 13:43.000]  literally just showed
[13:43.000 --> 13:45.000]  what a fraud the whole thing is. What is
[13:45.000 --> 13:47.000]  your angle on the fact that I mean I think
[13:47.000 --> 13:49.000]  it shows that it's total security theater
[13:49.000 --> 13:51.000]  that this guy was able to do that.
[13:51.000 --> 13:53.000]  Well, it shows how
[13:53.000 --> 13:55.000]  vulnerable everything is though too Alex
[13:55.000 --> 13:57.000]  because you think at the Super Bowl
[13:57.000 --> 13:59.000]  you know that would be a lockdown
[13:59.000 --> 14:01.000]  situation. How protected
[14:01.000 --> 14:03.000]  was the Super Bowl yesterday?
[14:03.000 --> 14:05.000]  They really had helicopters flying around
[14:05.000 --> 14:07.000]  and was it
[14:07.000 --> 14:09.000]  truly that difficult to get in?
[14:09.000 --> 14:11.000]  Would you have to go through three medals in that?
[14:11.000 --> 14:13.000]  Let me break it down. Jakari Jackson
[14:13.000 --> 14:15.000]  our reporter along with our camera guy
[14:15.000 --> 14:17.000]  but to leave their cameras behind obviously
[14:17.000 --> 14:19.000]  we're there for three days before and during covering it
[14:19.000 --> 14:21.000]  and I had to buy him
[14:21.000 --> 14:23.000]  by the time we got tickets $1,700
[14:23.000 --> 14:25.000]  for nosebleeds almost
[14:25.000 --> 14:27.000]  at the very back of that giant
[14:27.000 --> 14:29.000]  stadium. They do not allow
[14:29.000 --> 14:31.000]  cabs to get within a mile of it. They do not allow
[14:31.000 --> 14:33.000]  taxis. They do not allow limos.
[14:33.000 --> 14:35.000]  You have to
[14:35.000 --> 14:37.000]  get on a train and wait two hours
[14:37.000 --> 14:39.000]  each time on trains.
[14:39.000 --> 14:41.000]  People collapsed inside the train
[14:41.000 --> 14:43.000]  sitting there for hours in the heat because they had
[14:43.000 --> 14:45.000]  heaters on. That was in the news.
[14:45.000 --> 14:47.000]  They would then bus you and it would then take
[14:47.000 --> 14:49.000]  another two hours
[14:49.000 --> 14:51.000]  after the train gets there
[14:51.000 --> 14:53.000]  to go through security
[14:53.000 --> 14:55.000]  where they search your bags, grope your body
[14:55.000 --> 14:57.000]  metal detector you and then do it again
[14:57.000 --> 14:59.000]  and then do it again as you just
[14:59.000 --> 15:01.000]  said but then no one
[15:01.000 --> 15:03.000]  ever scanned or checked their ticket
[15:03.000 --> 15:05.000]  ever.
[15:05.000 --> 15:07.000]  Not even getting on the train. It was ultra
[15:07.000 --> 15:09.000]  bizarre. Jakari was like wait a minute
[15:09.000 --> 15:11.000]  there was all the security but there was no
[15:11.000 --> 15:13.000]  security and there were men with machine guns
[15:13.000 --> 15:15.000]  everywhere, police dogs, snipers
[15:15.000 --> 15:17.000]  gun boats
[15:17.000 --> 15:19.000]  five helicopters, jets flying
[15:19.000 --> 15:21.000]  over.
[15:21.000 --> 15:23.000]  You know Alex the question
[15:23.000 --> 15:25.000]  needs to be asked this and this is
[15:25.000 --> 15:27.000]  what I believe that people need to be
[15:27.000 --> 15:29.000]  asking the government
[15:29.000 --> 15:31.000]  is why
[15:31.000 --> 15:33.000]  if we're indeed that
[15:33.000 --> 15:35.000]  vulnerable and we're really
[15:35.000 --> 15:37.000]  that much under attack that
[15:37.000 --> 15:39.000]  the United States is now turning
[15:39.000 --> 15:41.000]  into East Berlin
[15:41.000 --> 15:43.000]  with its security precautions
[15:43.000 --> 15:45.000]  we need to ask the
[15:45.000 --> 15:47.000]  million dollar question
[15:47.000 --> 15:49.000]  why, what have we done
[15:49.000 --> 15:51.000]  and I'll repeat that, what have we
[15:51.000 --> 15:53.000]  done to incur
[15:53.000 --> 15:55.000]  the anger of people throughout
[15:55.000 --> 15:57.000]  the world to this extent
[15:57.000 --> 15:59.000]  because that's what we need
[15:59.000 --> 16:01.000]  to be looking at. What is
[16:01.000 --> 16:03.000]  causing people to hate the
[16:03.000 --> 16:05.000]  United States to the extent
[16:05.000 --> 16:07.000]  that they are. We used to
[16:07.000 --> 16:09.000]  be looked up to
[16:09.000 --> 16:11.000]  everywhere in the world used
[16:11.000 --> 16:13.000]  to look up and try to emulate the United
[16:13.000 --> 16:15.000]  States of America. They all wanted
[16:15.000 --> 16:17.000]  to be us.
[16:17.000 --> 16:19.000]  They all wanted that but today
[16:19.000 --> 16:21.000]  there's nobody doing that anymore
[16:21.000 --> 16:23.000]  and if we have to lock down
[16:23.000 --> 16:25.000]  our country be for fear
[16:25.000 --> 16:27.000]  of attack from some unknown
[16:27.000 --> 16:29.000]  entities well then
[16:29.000 --> 16:31.000]  we need to start looking in the mirror
[16:31.000 --> 16:33.000]  saying what are we doing
[16:33.000 --> 16:35.000]  that is causing this type of behavior
[16:35.000 --> 16:37.000]  throughout the world because
[16:37.000 --> 16:39.000]  we certainly didn't have to protect
[16:39.000 --> 16:41.000]  our Super Bowls 20
[16:41.000 --> 16:43.000]  years ago like this.
[16:43.000 --> 16:45.000]  Naturally there's always been some type
[16:45.000 --> 16:47.000]  of security at every event
[16:47.000 --> 16:49.000]  but as you stated the security
[16:49.000 --> 16:51.000]  was to make sure people had tickets
[16:51.000 --> 16:53.000]  because it used to be
[16:53.000 --> 16:55.000]  you had to worry about Stalpers and people sneaking in.
[16:55.000 --> 16:57.000]  Well and you had
[16:57.000 --> 16:59.000]  real police out there who
[16:59.000 --> 17:01.000]  do what to look for. You know what
[17:01.000 --> 17:03.000]  it is Governor, it's about training us to be slaves
[17:03.000 --> 17:05.000]  training us for the police state
[17:05.000 --> 17:07.000]  training us for a lockdown America
[17:07.000 --> 17:09.000]  during a financial collapse. Why do you
[17:09.000 --> 17:11.000]  think they're setting up what
[17:11.000 --> 17:13.000]  I would call classical incremental
[17:13.000 --> 17:15.000]  martial law? What do you think it's in preparation
[17:15.000 --> 17:17.000]  for Jesse Ventura? Well
[17:17.000 --> 17:19.000]  it troubles me greatly
[17:19.000 --> 17:21.000]  because obviously somebody feels
[17:21.000 --> 17:23.000]  there's going to be a need for martial law
[17:23.000 --> 17:25.000]  and I can't for the life
[17:25.000 --> 17:27.000]  of me figure out if our
[17:27.000 --> 17:29.000]  society is what we deem it to be
[17:29.000 --> 17:31.000]  why there would ever be a need for
[17:31.000 --> 17:33.000]  martial law. What in the
[17:33.000 --> 17:35.000]  United States of America, you know people
[17:35.000 --> 17:37.000]  need to wake up and realize
[17:37.000 --> 17:39.000]  that they have each
[17:39.000 --> 17:41.000]  of us as individuals
[17:41.000 --> 17:43.000]  have about as much chance of being
[17:43.000 --> 17:45.000]  attacked by a terrorist as we do
[17:45.000 --> 17:47.000]  winning the Powerball.
[17:47.000 --> 17:49.000]  And yet, we're
[17:49.000 --> 17:51.000]  preparing like some sort of al-Qaeda
[17:51.000 --> 17:53.000]  invasion of Normandy is going to
[17:53.000 --> 17:55.000]  happen at Virginia Beach, Virginia
[17:55.000 --> 17:57.000]  and it's
[17:57.000 --> 17:59.000]  insane and I have to agree
[17:59.000 --> 18:01.000]  with you Alex, the people in the know
[18:01.000 --> 18:03.000]  must be preparing for something
[18:03.000 --> 18:05.000]  that they sure don't want us to know about
[18:05.000 --> 18:07.000]  because this lockdown of
[18:07.000 --> 18:09.000]  America over 9-11
[18:09.000 --> 18:11.000]  and over the Patriot Act
[18:11.000 --> 18:13.000]  is utterly absurd. It's time to get
[18:13.000 --> 18:15.000]  rid of the Patriot Act
[18:15.000 --> 18:17.000]  and take the country back to what it used to be
[18:17.000 --> 18:19.000]  instead of this police state
[18:19.000 --> 18:21.000]  that's turning it into.
[18:21.000 --> 18:23.000]  My issue is they just keep accelerating
[18:23.000 --> 18:25.000]  it to where more and more it sounds like
[18:25.000 --> 18:27.000]  a good idea to leave the country like you've done
[18:27.000 --> 18:29.000]  shifting gears, I believe
[18:29.000 --> 18:31.000]  as you've said, getting off the grid
[18:31.000 --> 18:33.000]  becoming self-sufficient
[18:33.000 --> 18:35.000]  that's how you make sure
[18:35.000 --> 18:37.000]  you can't be domesticated. This system
[18:37.000 --> 18:39.000]  wants you on food stamps, it wants you dependent
[18:39.000 --> 18:41.000]  it wants you scared, not having your
[18:41.000 --> 18:43.000]  own guns with police all around with guns
[18:43.000 --> 18:45.000]  they want us domesticated.
[18:45.000 --> 18:47.000]  So, I want to spend a few minutes before we get back
[18:47.000 --> 18:49.000]  into the news and this latest overdose
[18:49.000 --> 18:51.000]  and the heroin out of Afghanistan
[18:51.000 --> 18:53.000]  I want to ask Governor Jesse Ventura
[18:53.000 --> 18:55.000]  because I had a lot of fun being on your show last week
[18:55.000 --> 18:57.000]  uncensored
[18:57.000 --> 18:59.000]  and it was just great. I was on Skype, you were on Skype
[18:59.000 --> 19:01.000]  felt like I was there in the room with you
[19:01.000 --> 19:03.000]  spend a few minutes talking about some of
[19:03.000 --> 19:05.000]  the shows you're doing
[19:05.000 --> 19:07.000]  I mean you're doing them what four days a week
[19:07.000 --> 19:09.000]  at least and some of the stuff
[19:09.000 --> 19:11.000]  that's coming up because I mean
[19:11.000 --> 19:13.000]  this is the type of show that I personally am going to be watching.
[19:13.000 --> 19:15.000]  Well, it's fun for me
[19:15.000 --> 19:17.000]  Alex because as you know
[19:17.000 --> 19:19.000]  since I left the office I've had a very
[19:19.000 --> 19:21.000]  difficult time getting
[19:21.000 --> 19:23.000]  my message out there
[19:23.000 --> 19:25.000]  you stated earlier Fox News won't
[19:25.000 --> 19:27.000]  have me on MSNBC won't have me on
[19:27.000 --> 19:29.000]  CNN
[19:29.000 --> 19:31.000]  allows me on a little bit
[19:31.000 --> 19:33.000]  my last book because it dealt with the Kennedy
[19:33.000 --> 19:35.000]  killing none of the major
[19:35.000 --> 19:37.000]  networks would have me on
[19:37.000 --> 19:39.000]  not NBC, not ABC, not CBS
[19:39.000 --> 19:41.000]  Fox, none of them
[19:41.000 --> 19:43.000]  and I've always
[19:43.000 --> 19:45.000]  since I got out of office in
[19:45.000 --> 19:47.000]  203 when I had that
[19:47.000 --> 19:49.000]  debolical that happened at
[19:49.000 --> 19:51.000]  MSNBC where they wouldn't put me
[19:51.000 --> 19:53.000]  on the air because I opposed the war
[19:53.000 --> 19:55.000]  in Iraq and they paid me
[19:55.000 --> 19:57.000]  for three years and literally handcuffed
[19:57.000 --> 19:59.000]  me and kept me off the air
[19:59.000 --> 20:01.000]  and then I've been fighting to find a way
[20:01.000 --> 20:03.000]  how can I talk to the American people
[20:03.000 --> 20:05.000]  unfiltered how can I talk to the
[20:05.000 --> 20:07.000]  American people without
[20:07.000 --> 20:09.000]  being on these stations that decide
[20:09.000 --> 20:11.000]  whether I can come on or not
[20:11.000 --> 20:13.000]  and ORA.com
[20:13.000 --> 20:15.000]  has come forward and it actually happened
[20:15.000 --> 20:17.000]  while I was on a book tour I did Larry King
[20:17.000 --> 20:19.000]  and I thought Larry
[20:19.000 --> 20:21.000]  had retired you know I thought Larry
[20:21.000 --> 20:23.000]  left CNN I didn't know that he was on the internet
[20:23.000 --> 20:25.000]  well I said Larry what are you doing
[20:25.000 --> 20:27.000]  you said I'm on the internet you need to be
[20:27.000 --> 20:29.000]  on this and that's how it all started
[20:29.000 --> 20:31.000]  ORA TV does Larry King
[20:31.000 --> 20:33.000]  and they got interested then in me
[20:33.000 --> 20:35.000]  and they felt I was a voice that needed to be
[20:35.000 --> 20:37.000]  heard and the important thing is
[20:37.000 --> 20:39.000]  the owner of the company is not
[20:39.000 --> 20:41.000]  from the United States of America
[20:41.000 --> 20:43.000]  so therefore he has no dog
[20:43.000 --> 20:45.000]  in the fight when I want to
[20:45.000 --> 20:47.000]  criticize our policy and be
[20:47.000 --> 20:49.000]  an engaged American citizen
[20:49.000 --> 20:51.000]  and be vigilant a
[20:51.000 --> 20:53.000]  term that I've been using from the start
[20:53.000 --> 20:55.000]  that I like to assume President Obama
[20:55.000 --> 20:57.000]  stole from me
[20:57.000 --> 20:59.000]  for the State of the Union address
[20:59.000 --> 21:01.000]  because lo and behold he also
[21:01.000 --> 21:03.000]  used the term vigilant
[21:03.000 --> 21:05.000]  and this show has offered me
[21:05.000 --> 21:07.000]  that ability and to be able to
[21:07.000 --> 21:09.000]  and I thought to myself you know
[21:09.000 --> 21:11.000]  I've been inside the United States yelling
[21:11.000 --> 21:13.000]  and screaming from the inside out
[21:13.000 --> 21:15.000]  and nobody seems to want to listen
[21:15.000 --> 21:17.000]  maybe it'll work better from the outside
[21:17.000 --> 21:19.000]  going in so that's what it's done
[21:19.000 --> 21:21.000]  for me doing this show
[21:21.000 --> 21:23.000]  I can't tell you how happy I am
[21:23.000 --> 21:25.000]  I've been centered any topics
[21:25.000 --> 21:27.000]  I want to talk about
[21:27.000 --> 21:29.000]  and of course it's on the Internet
[21:29.000 --> 21:31.000]  so shows are roughly only 8 to 12 minutes
[21:31.000 --> 21:33.000]  long because that's the style
[21:33.000 --> 21:35.000]  of the Internet they're more quick hits
[21:35.000 --> 21:37.000]  you're not going to have
[21:37.000 --> 21:39.000]  an hour hour and a half long show
[21:39.000 --> 21:41.000]  that's going to work that well I don't think
[21:41.000 --> 21:43.000]  so it works out terrific for me
[21:43.000 --> 21:45.000]  and it lets me live in sheer freedom
[21:45.000 --> 21:47.000]  down here and we'll be moving it
[21:47.000 --> 21:49.000]  about to the show Alex
[21:49.000 --> 21:51.000]  we don't want them to get a pin point
[21:51.000 --> 21:53.000]  we don't want them finding us with drones
[21:53.000 --> 21:55.000]  so we'll be doing the show
[21:55.000 --> 21:57.000]  different locations off the grid
[21:57.000 --> 21:59.000]  we'll keep them desperate
[21:59.000 --> 22:01.000]  well it's just really exciting
[22:01.000 --> 22:03.000]  the revolution of true independent media
[22:03.000 --> 22:05.000]  Larry King when they kicked him off
[22:05.000 --> 22:07.000]  3 years ago had 2 million listeners
[22:07.000 --> 22:09.000]  viewers of 9
[22:09.000 --> 22:11.000]  Piers Morgan and I know you know him he has you on
[22:11.000 --> 22:13.000]  you know it's down to about 400,000
[22:13.000 --> 22:15.000]  MSNBC has gone from a million
[22:15.000 --> 22:17.000]  down to about 300,000
[22:17.000 --> 22:19.000]  I mean back when you were on MSNBC
[22:19.000 --> 22:21.000]  10 million viewers some nights
[22:21.000 --> 22:23.000]  mainstream media isn't just
[22:23.000 --> 22:25.000]  dying because of the Internet
[22:25.000 --> 22:27.000]  because my show is just exploding
[22:27.000 --> 22:29.000]  and many others are it's the content
[22:29.000 --> 22:31.000]  but they're still I mean Larry King
[22:31.000 --> 22:33.000]  wasn't controllable enough for them
[22:33.000 --> 22:35.000]  so they got him off seeing
[22:35.000 --> 22:37.000]  in and it just shows what do you
[22:37.000 --> 22:39.000]  Jesse Ventura you're a smart guy you're savvy
[22:39.000 --> 22:41.000]  where do you see the media
[22:41.000 --> 22:43.000]  wars going where do you see the
[22:43.000 --> 22:45.000]  establishment going where do you see
[22:45.000 --> 22:47.000]  just you know all the
[22:47.000 --> 22:49.000]  new banker bailouts all the corruption
[22:49.000 --> 22:51.000]  what is your gut about
[22:51.000 --> 22:53.000]  where the future of humanity is going
[22:53.000 --> 22:55.000]  well you know to me
[22:55.000 --> 22:57.000]  when you talk in communications
[22:57.000 --> 22:59.000]  it's the Internet I mean
[22:59.000 --> 23:01.000]  you know it's taking over so strong
[23:01.000 --> 23:03.000]  now that's why I'm on it
[23:03.000 --> 23:05.000]  the freedom of being on it
[23:05.000 --> 23:07.000]  and you can rest assured the government
[23:07.000 --> 23:09.000]  is going to try to get control of it
[23:09.000 --> 23:11.000]  they've got to from their perspective
[23:11.000 --> 23:13.000]  if they're going to control us
[23:13.000 --> 23:15.000]  they got to control the Internet
[23:15.000 --> 23:17.000]  I personally hope they never ever
[23:17.000 --> 23:19.000]  get control of it I love the
[23:19.000 --> 23:21.000]  freedom of it it falls right under
[23:21.000 --> 23:23.000]  freedom of speech our First Amendment
[23:23.000 --> 23:25.000]  and the Bill of Rights we have the right
[23:25.000 --> 23:27.000]  to speak freely and the Bill of Rights
[23:27.000 --> 23:29.000]  freedom of speech as I've
[23:29.000 --> 23:31.000]  said so often it's there
[23:31.000 --> 23:33.000]  to protect unpopular speech
[23:33.000 --> 23:35.000]  because popular speech doesn't need
[23:35.000 --> 23:37.000]  protected it's unpopular
[23:37.000 --> 23:39.000]  speech that needs to protect that's right
[23:39.000 --> 23:41.000]  or speech that goes
[23:41.000 --> 23:43.000]  against the status quo
[23:43.000 --> 23:45.000]  it may be minority
[23:45.000 --> 23:47.000]  speech you're talking about
[23:47.000 --> 23:49.000]  excuse me
[23:49.000 --> 23:51.000]  something that the majority
[23:51.000 --> 23:53.000]  doesn't necessarily can control
[23:53.000 --> 23:55.000]  and that's what's important about the Internet
[23:55.000 --> 23:57.000]  well that's right
[23:57.000 --> 23:59.000]  Alex I think the Internet
[23:59.000 --> 24:01.000]  and I'm probably
[24:01.000 --> 24:03.000]  being very liberal here
[24:03.000 --> 24:05.000]  I see the Internet
[24:05.000 --> 24:07.000]  taking over all communications
[24:07.000 --> 24:09.000]  within a decade no I agree totally
[24:09.000 --> 24:11.000]  no I think you're right
[24:11.000 --> 24:13.000]  maybe maybe five six years I mean the way
[24:13.000 --> 24:15.000]  it's going but cyber security
[24:15.000 --> 24:17.000]  homeland security they admit
[24:17.000 --> 24:19.000]  with big media they want to
[24:19.000 --> 24:21.000]  censor it track it tax it
[24:21.000 --> 24:23.000]  web ID it
[24:23.000 --> 24:25.000]  and geolocate it geofilter
[24:25.000 --> 24:27.000]  it so that they can kill
[24:27.000 --> 24:29.000]  competition because
[24:29.000 --> 24:31.000]  these guys can't compete with us Governor
[24:31.000 --> 24:33.000]  well you know and that may be the case
[24:33.000 --> 24:35.000]  it's like the old saying from deep
[24:35.000 --> 24:37.000]  throat Alex follow the money
[24:37.000 --> 24:39.000]  the money you lead
[24:39.000 --> 24:41.000]  you know that money is what
[24:41.000 --> 24:43.000]  gets government to react money money
[24:43.000 --> 24:45.000]  money if there's money to be
[24:45.000 --> 24:47.000]  made government wants a piece of it
[24:47.000 --> 24:49.000]  on another note that will
[24:49.000 --> 24:51.000]  switch gears here again
[24:51.000 --> 24:53.000]  I want to talk about it you know
[24:53.000 --> 24:55.000]  and we just make the good transition
[24:55.000 --> 24:57.000]  to the war on drugs that you wanted to talk
[24:57.000 --> 24:59.000]  about I'm so proud
[24:59.000 --> 25:01.000]  of the states of Washington and Colorado
[25:01.000 --> 25:03.000]  the two Super Bowl participants
[25:03.000 --> 25:05.000]  but I'm even more proud of them
[25:05.000 --> 25:07.000]  not for their Super Bowl football teams
[25:07.000 --> 25:09.000]  I'm proud of them because they have voted
[25:09.000 --> 25:11.000]  the people in those states to legalize
[25:11.000 --> 25:13.000]  marijuana and strike a blow
[25:13.000 --> 25:15.000]  against this war on drugs
[25:15.000 --> 25:17.000]  that in a free society should
[25:17.000 --> 25:19.000]  never be happening
[25:19.000 --> 25:21.000]  drug addiction should be
[25:21.000 --> 25:23.000]  treated medically addiction
[25:23.000 --> 25:25.000]  should be treated medically not
[25:25.000 --> 25:27.000]  criminally you can be
[25:27.000 --> 25:29.000]  addicted to anything people imagine
[25:29.000 --> 25:31.000]  the addiction to coffee
[25:31.000 --> 25:33.000]  now and that's a
[25:33.000 --> 25:35.000]  powerful addiction I remember when I was
[25:35.000 --> 25:37.000]  in the Navy if you didn't make
[25:37.000 --> 25:39.000]  the coffee the chiefs were ready to
[25:39.000 --> 25:41.000]  hang you from the yard arms
[25:41.000 --> 25:43.000]  and I never drink coffee
[25:43.000 --> 25:45.000]  I've never been a coffee addict
[25:45.000 --> 25:47.000]  but when you watch people not get their morning
[25:47.000 --> 25:49.000]  cup of coffee and you watch how it
[25:49.000 --> 25:51.000]  affects them in their daily life
[25:51.000 --> 25:53.000]  clearly it's a powerful addiction
[25:53.000 --> 25:55.000]  well again addiction
[25:55.000 --> 25:57.000]  you can be addicted to hostess
[25:57.000 --> 25:59.000]  20 for that matter exactly
[25:59.000 --> 26:01.000]  you're not going to arrest people for sugar though
[26:01.000 --> 26:03.000]  now Bloomberg the outgoing mayor
[26:03.000 --> 26:05.000]  said let me shift gears before we get into the drugs
[26:05.000 --> 26:07.000]  because I want to tie it in we're about to go to break
[26:07.000 --> 26:09.000]  I want to come back and talk about the dead actor
[26:09.000 --> 26:11.000]  who I was a fan of he was a great actor
[26:11.000 --> 26:13.000]  and this super heroin that killed him and tie it
[26:13.000 --> 26:15.000]  in you know to how the drugs are being shipped in
[26:15.000 --> 26:17.000]  from Afghanistan and get your take on that
[26:17.000 --> 26:19.000]  but since you mentioned censorship of journalism
[26:19.000 --> 26:21.000]  and the internet as you know we'll put the LA Times
[26:21.000 --> 26:23.000]  article on screen
[26:23.000 --> 26:25.000]  Los Angeles Times who's a journalist
[26:25.000 --> 26:27.000]  Senator Dianne Feinstein
[26:27.000 --> 26:29.000]  wants to draw a line
[26:29.000 --> 26:31.000]  and literally shut down bloggers talk
[26:31.000 --> 26:33.000]  radio you name it
[26:33.000 --> 26:35.000]  and not let us have journalistic protections
[26:35.000 --> 26:37.000]  she's absolutely a monster
[26:37.000 --> 26:39.000]  and you've got John D. Rockefeller
[26:39.000 --> 26:41.000]  the senator
[26:41.000 --> 26:43.000]  from West Virginia saying quote we'd be better off
[26:43.000 --> 26:45.000]  if the internet was never invented
[26:45.000 --> 26:47.000]  so I agree with you
[26:47.000 --> 26:49.000]  and I remember calling you the night
[26:49.000 --> 26:51.000]  and calling Tyrell the night
[26:51.000 --> 26:53.000]  I've never done this on the TV show and I was involved
[26:53.000 --> 26:55.000]  at that time like 10 episodes
[26:55.000 --> 26:57.000]  of the 16 or so that had been on
[26:57.000 --> 26:59.000]  and I'll never forget calling you
[26:59.000 --> 27:01.000]  as a consultant and saying governor I just
[27:01.000 --> 27:03.000]  want to say congratulations
[27:03.000 --> 27:05.000]  for putting the most powerful television
[27:05.000 --> 27:07.000]  on ever your FEMA
[27:07.000 --> 27:09.000]  special exposes the whole takeover
[27:09.000 --> 27:11.000]  plan the whole plan with the FEMA
[27:11.000 --> 27:13.000]  centers I cannot believe this
[27:13.000 --> 27:15.000]  got on air with almost two million
[27:15.000 --> 27:17.000]  viewers record views for a new show on
[27:17.000 --> 27:19.000]  on on on true TV
[27:19.000 --> 27:21.000]  then congress gets involved
[27:21.000 --> 27:23.000]  all of it happens the way you
[27:23.000 --> 27:25.000]  scared that congressman and they killed
[27:25.000 --> 27:27.000]  it airing again when they normally air it
[27:27.000 --> 27:29.000]  50 more times so it seemed
[27:29.000 --> 27:31.000]  upwards of 50 million people most re-heirs of a million
[27:31.000 --> 27:33.000]  viewers incredible
[27:33.000 --> 27:35.000]  to to to to to see
[27:35.000 --> 27:37.000]  that that so threatened the establishment
[27:37.000 --> 27:39.000]  that within hours they
[27:39.000 --> 27:41.000]  flipped out can you speak to that
[27:41.000 --> 27:43.000]  well it was I don't know
[27:43.000 --> 27:45.000]  if you want to call it an honor to be
[27:45.000 --> 27:47.000]  to be taken down
[27:47.000 --> 27:49.000]  on the congressional floor but that's what
[27:49.000 --> 27:51.000]  actually happened congressman cone
[27:51.000 --> 27:53.000]  the guy who co-sponsored
[27:53.000 --> 27:55.000]  the bill to build these FEMA camps
[27:55.000 --> 27:57.000]  actually chastised me
[27:57.000 --> 27:59.000]  in my show on the floor of the congress
[27:59.000 --> 28:01.000]  and I guess I should take that
[28:01.000 --> 28:03.000]  for a compliment
[28:03.000 --> 28:05.000]  to get that far but
[28:05.000 --> 28:07.000]  you're right that show never aired
[28:07.000 --> 28:09.000]  again they then removed it
[28:09.000 --> 28:11.000]  wouldn't even acknowledge that we did it
[28:11.000 --> 28:13.000]  they took it off Kivo they took it off
[28:13.000 --> 28:15.000]  the the cable servers oh yeah they did
[28:15.000 --> 28:17.000]  all that so people out there that
[28:17.000 --> 28:19.000]  believe that we're not already being
[28:19.000 --> 28:21.000]  operated under a certain
[28:21.000 --> 28:23.000]  censorship are naive
[28:23.000 --> 28:25.000]  and sadly mistaken and they better
[28:25.000 --> 28:27.000]  wake up to the fact that
[28:27.000 --> 28:29.000]  even a show like mine
[28:29.000 --> 28:31.000]  when it comes out and tells the truth
[28:31.000 --> 28:33.000]  on a particular subject
[28:33.000 --> 28:35.000]  if it if it offends too many of the
[28:35.000 --> 28:37.000]  status quo and the government
[28:37.000 --> 28:39.000]  they'll step in and do what they did to that
[28:39.000 --> 28:41.000]  show and basically remove it so
[28:41.000 --> 28:43.000]  that more people can never see it
[28:43.000 --> 28:45.000]  but it's still out there because the great
[28:45.000 --> 28:47.000]  thing about the internet today is
[28:47.000 --> 28:49.000]  once it's shown once
[28:49.000 --> 28:51.000]  it's going to be somewhere
[28:51.000 --> 28:53.000]  well we're going to break but I want to come back
[28:53.000 --> 28:55.000]  and get into the drug war other key issues
[28:55.000 --> 28:57.000]  that you're focused on but I wanted to raise that
[28:57.000 --> 28:59.000]  because people better appreciate
[28:59.000 --> 29:01.000]  prismplanet.tv the info wars
[29:01.000 --> 29:03.000]  nightly news our subscription service
[29:03.000 --> 29:05.000]  they better appreciate governor ventura
[29:05.000 --> 29:07.000]  and or a tv
[29:07.000 --> 29:09.000]  or slash off the grid or a tv
[29:09.000 --> 29:11.000]  they better appreciate
[29:11.000 --> 29:13.000]  that ventura four days a week
[29:13.000 --> 29:15.000]  is producing a show that six days
[29:15.000 --> 29:17.000]  a week we're doing it it's hard work
[29:17.000 --> 29:19.000]  we're all in this together we love freedom is why we do it
[29:19.000 --> 29:21.000]  but it's not pearls before swine
[29:21.000 --> 29:23.000]  understand folks we're busting our
[29:23.000 --> 29:25.000]  butt and the enemy the establishment
[29:25.000 --> 29:27.000]  does not like this we've gone through a
[29:27.000 --> 29:29.000]  lot of trouble a lot of threats a lot
[29:29.000 --> 29:31.000]  of behind the scenes stuff ventura doesn't
[29:31.000 --> 29:33.000]  want people to even know about and that's fine I won't talk about
[29:33.000 --> 29:35.000]  it I've been through it too so we're brothers
[29:35.000 --> 29:37.000]  and arms in those shared experiences
[29:37.000 --> 29:39.000]  of trying to use our first amendment
[29:39.000 --> 29:41.000]  and being so effective
[29:41.000 --> 29:43.000]  look at all the JFK people that have been killed or
[29:43.000 --> 29:45.000]  targeted I won't talk about that with
[29:45.000 --> 29:47.000]  ventura as well when we come back but this is

[32:00.000 --> 32:02.000]  the facts are in the studies are legion
[32:02.000 --> 32:06.000]  sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family
[32:06.000 --> 32:10.000]  are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people
[32:10.000 --> 32:14.000]  so why are the social engineers adding it to the water
[32:14.000 --> 32:19.000]  simple dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on
[32:19.000 --> 32:23.000]  we may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet
[32:23.000 --> 32:25.000]  but we can help to get it out of our bodies
[32:25.000 --> 32:31.000]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive info wars life fluoride shield formulation
[32:31.000 --> 32:35.000]  fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world

[32:39.000 --> 32:41.000]  but a whole host of toxic substances

[32:54.000 --> 32:58.000]  let's start cleansing our bodies now and support the info war at the same time
[32:58.000 --> 33:00.000]  that's infowarslife.com
[33:00.000 --> 33:14.000]  perhaps when these mystery and control freaks look into the panoptagon of datum
[33:14.000 --> 33:21.000]  in a shadow of a shadow a grain of sand at the beach compared to the mind of God
[33:21.000 --> 33:25.000]  the supreme being perhaps they'll see how ugly they are spiritually
[33:25.000 --> 33:27.000]  and gain knowledge
[33:27.000 --> 33:32.000]  because they say with great knowledge comes great sorrow for those that are pure of heart
[33:32.000 --> 33:36.000]  with this great knowledge isn't nothing but a magnifying glass
[33:36.000 --> 33:40.000]  so they can enjoy their crimes against humanity that much more
[33:40.000 --> 33:47.000]  you know my biggest issue is as I come to full grips with what we face as a civilization
[33:47.000 --> 33:50.000]  and as a species in our long history
[33:50.000 --> 33:55.000]  I realize that my life is a flash in the pan twinkle in the eye
[33:55.000 --> 33:59.000]  like the lilies of the field out out brief candle
[33:59.000 --> 34:05.000]  but that it is the great struggle of the race to uplift ourselves and become nobler
[34:05.000 --> 34:09.000]  that I am part of and that you are part of and that what matters to me
[34:09.000 --> 34:13.000]  is that we make it to the next level and don't destroy ourselves
[34:13.000 --> 34:18.000]  and the greatest crime of the establishment is telling us how bad we are all day
[34:18.000 --> 34:23.000]  except when the leader comes out Obama and then he tells us we're good
[34:23.000 --> 34:26.000]  and so we go oh he must be good because he's telling us we're good
[34:26.000 --> 34:29.000]  I mean it's disgusting they know exactly what they're doing
[34:29.000 --> 34:36.000]  and it's like watching a Navy SEAL beat up a newborn baby
[34:36.000 --> 34:43.000]  it's like watching an NFL linebacker beat up a one year old
[34:43.000 --> 34:48.000]  I mean it's really pathetic that they sit there and abuse these people
[34:48.000 --> 34:53.000]  and then laugh at them it's disgusting
[34:53.000 --> 34:58.000]  and I personally get to the point up here where
[34:58.000 --> 35:01.000]  trying to run this operation everything we do
[35:01.000 --> 35:06.000]  and the way the establishment tries to guilt anyone in new media that tries to fund themselves
[35:06.000 --> 35:09.000]  I mean it's all just mind games manipulating good people
[35:09.000 --> 35:13.000]  and it's time to vote with your dollars it's time to spread the word about news sites
[35:13.000 --> 35:19.000]  like infowars.com, prisonbunna.com, rogerport.com it's such a beacon of liberty
[35:19.000 --> 35:24.000]  it's time to really get behind the sources that will talk about the real issues that matter
[35:24.000 --> 35:27.000]  and actually put those on the front of the table
[35:27.000 --> 35:31.000]  our ascension is a great responsibility
[35:31.000 --> 35:34.000]  but it's only happening because great tyranny is rising
[35:34.000 --> 35:40.000]  it's a battle it's a war it's not a bunch of narcissistic baloney it is a struggle
[35:40.000 --> 35:44.000]  and you will find that in that animating struggle of liberty
[35:44.000 --> 35:47.000]  that animating contest you will find your humanity
[35:47.000 --> 35:51.000]  and I know you know that but don't just take our incredible reports for granted
[35:51.000 --> 35:54.000]  that are on prisonplanet.tv and the YouTube channel
[35:54.000 --> 35:57.000]  don't just take the news sites and the articles for granted
[35:57.000 --> 35:59.000]  I mean it is hard work to ever get to this point
[35:59.000 --> 36:02.000]  a lot of prayers a lot of providence
[36:02.000 --> 36:06.000]  and I'm telling myself that I better appreciate the position I'm in
[36:06.000 --> 36:10.000]  I'd better understand that I can't get
[36:10.000 --> 36:13.000]  I can't get target fatigue
[36:13.000 --> 36:18.000]  being so close to this get acclimated to just how big a situation we're in
[36:18.000 --> 36:21.000]  and I do in closing for this hour before Gelsa Lente comes up
[36:21.000 --> 36:23.000]  I haven't plugged all day
[36:23.000 --> 36:26.000]  we are listed supported mainly
[36:26.000 --> 36:29.000]  and we sell the best products I can find
[36:29.000 --> 36:31.000]  the best water filters, the lowest prices
[36:31.000 --> 36:34.000]  the Pro Pure and others with promo code water
[36:34.000 --> 36:36.000]  the best supplements and the best coffee
[36:36.000 --> 36:39.000]  lack of America coffee from southern Mexico
[36:39.000 --> 36:41.000]  fluoride shield with the nasa and iodine
[36:41.000 --> 36:44.000]  the five other ingredients that can be taken with the survival shield
[36:44.000 --> 36:47.000]  but talk to your physician if you have any issues
[36:47.000 --> 36:49.000]  the life straws
[36:49.000 --> 36:52.000]  we got some combos and some specials running
[36:52.000 --> 36:54.000]  infowarslife.com and it is midair refueling
[36:54.000 --> 36:56.000]  it is buying your war bonds
[36:56.000 --> 36:58.000]  and I know you do it out there
[36:58.000 --> 37:00.000]  but especially those of you that have wealth
[37:00.000 --> 37:02.000]  and know I'm telling the truth
[37:02.000 --> 37:05.000]  I kind of got where you are because you have an instinct to be selfish
[37:05.000 --> 37:07.000]  this is not the time to have that instinct
[37:07.000 --> 37:09.000]  that was in the old system before we fell
[37:09.000 --> 37:11.000]  and we're going into a very dangerous time
[37:11.000 --> 37:14.000]  where if you're not all in and don't spread the word about this broadcast
[37:14.000 --> 37:17.000]  and don't become president planet dot tv members and share memberships
[37:17.000 --> 37:21.000]  if you don't buy the products at infowarslife.com
[37:21.000 --> 37:23.000]  I need a lot more money to be secure
[37:23.000 --> 37:25.000]  to be strong in the face of the enemy
[37:25.000 --> 37:27.000]  I need good armor
[37:27.000 --> 37:30.000]  I need good systems to project the truth at the enemy
[37:30.000 --> 37:32.000]  I need weapons in the info war
[37:32.000 --> 37:34.000]  and I need you to fill our war chest
[37:34.000 --> 37:36.000]  at infowarslife.com
[37:36.000 --> 37:38.000]  infowarsstore.com
[37:38.000 --> 37:40.000]  or 888-253-33139
[37:40.000 --> 37:42.000]  in your life and how you conduct it
[37:42.000 --> 37:45.000]  and you don't have to be a big national leader
[37:45.000 --> 37:47.000]  if you just live day to day
[37:47.000 --> 37:49.000]  and stay a vigilant citizen
[37:49.000 --> 37:52.000]  focused on what's happening locally
[37:52.000 --> 37:54.000]  in your local school board
[37:54.000 --> 37:56.000]  what happens in your local town
[37:56.000 --> 37:58.000]  and remain active
[37:58.000 --> 38:01.000]  because those are the heroes that make the United States
[38:01.000 --> 38:02.000]  the great country it is
[38:02.000 --> 38:05.000]  are the everyday citizens that take part
[38:05.000 --> 38:08.000]  in the creation of this great country
[38:08.000 --> 38:10.000]  and keeping it running like it is
[38:10.000 --> 38:13.000]  and Alex we're just lucky that we were the people
[38:13.000 --> 38:16.000]  that seemed to have a voice and can be heard
[38:16.000 --> 38:19.000]  but we really need the millions and millions out there
[38:19.000 --> 38:22.000]  to stand up and finally be counted
[38:22.000 --> 38:24.000]  because if they don't do that
[38:24.000 --> 38:26.000]  we're going to lose our great country
[38:26.000 --> 38:29.000]  that's not going to be the country that you and I were born in
[38:29.000 --> 38:32.000]  it's certainly not the country that I was born in
[38:32.000 --> 38:35.000]  and the way the direction it's heading for me today
[38:35.000 --> 38:37.000]  it's not the country that I want to die in
[38:37.000 --> 38:40.000]  and I would like to get it back to being the country
[38:40.000 --> 38:42.000]  I would like to die in someday
[38:42.000 --> 38:45.000]  well that's right and you've said that if people
[38:45.000 --> 38:47.000]  get behind a national movement to have you run for president
[38:47.000 --> 38:49.000]  if they get it lined up and show enough interest
[38:49.000 --> 38:51.000]  then you'll do it but you can't do everything
[38:51.000 --> 38:53.000]  a guy two weeks ago ran into a burning house
[38:53.000 --> 38:55.000]  to get his Xbox
[38:55.000 --> 38:58.000]  same week a guy wouldn't run in his house to get his kids
[38:58.000 --> 39:01.000]  and I think about people rioting and burning things
[39:01.000 --> 39:04.000]  and jumping over cars and attacking police
[39:04.000 --> 39:08.000]  in Seattle when the Seahawks won
[39:08.000 --> 39:11.000]  you know I wish people would show
[39:11.000 --> 39:14.000]  not that energy for rioting but that same energy
[39:14.000 --> 39:17.000]  politically for freedom what's your take on that governor
[39:17.000 --> 39:20.000]  I agree you know people need to get more motivated
[39:20.000 --> 39:23.000]  let's remember something football is nothing more than entertainment
[39:23.000 --> 39:26.000]  and that's the real problem with our country today
[39:26.000 --> 39:29.000]  we have become an entertainment society now
[39:29.000 --> 39:33.000]  where entertainment is the most important thing in our lives
[39:33.000 --> 39:35.000]  and if they look at history they'll find out
[39:35.000 --> 39:38.000]  that's exactly what happened to the Roman Empire
[39:38.000 --> 39:41.000]  of course they became enhanced with entertainment
[39:41.000 --> 39:44.000]  entertainment became the main focus
[39:44.000 --> 39:47.000]  and you know football's grade sports is terrific
[39:47.000 --> 39:50.000]  and being entertained is a wonderful thing
[39:50.000 --> 39:53.000]  but if you break your day up we need to get back
[39:53.000 --> 39:56.000]  concentrating on the real things in life you know
[39:56.000 --> 40:00.000]  it used to be you concentrated on working
[40:00.000 --> 40:03.000]  an eight or ten hour day today that's the sideline
[40:03.000 --> 40:07.000]  what people focus on today is how do I entertain myself
[40:07.000 --> 40:10.000]  that other four to six hours when I'm not working
[40:10.000 --> 40:13.000]  and I'm not sleeping and we need to take more pride
[40:13.000 --> 40:17.000]  in our work and more pride in being involved
[40:17.000 --> 40:20.000]  in our communities helping people out
[40:20.000 --> 40:24.000]  you know I often laugh because you hear stories about
[40:24.000 --> 40:26.000]  you know I'm an admitted atheist now
[40:26.000 --> 40:29.000]  and you hear stories about well atheists they can't
[40:29.000 --> 40:32.000]  they don't have values yes we do
[40:32.000 --> 40:35.000]  and it's the value of every day treating your fellow man
[40:35.000 --> 40:39.000]  the old golden rule treat people the way you would want to be treated
[40:39.000 --> 40:42.000]  and go out there and get involved help people
[40:42.000 --> 40:44.000]  there's nothing more gratifying in the world
[40:44.000 --> 40:47.000]  than helping someone and they don't need money
[40:47.000 --> 40:48.000]  in which to do it
[40:48.000 --> 40:50.000]  well and you know I respect the fact that we agree
[40:50.000 --> 40:53.000]  on about 95% of stuff but I totally get the fact that
[40:53.000 --> 40:56.000]  the churches are so evil and so hypocritical
[40:56.000 --> 40:59.000]  and are a bunch of Pharisees I don't blame people
[40:59.000 --> 41:02.000]  running the opposite direction from these institutions
[41:02.000 --> 41:05.000]  and I know you're a moral person who genuinely cares about
[41:05.000 --> 41:08.000]  humanity from a human perspective and I admire that
[41:08.000 --> 41:11.000]  and that's what it's all about the people that shake their finger
[41:11.000 --> 41:14.000]  at each other and just want to infight over religion
[41:14.000 --> 41:17.000]  you know are the hypocrites and if they let a better example
[41:17.000 --> 41:19.000]  out there you know people wouldn't see them
[41:19.000 --> 41:21.000]  for the disgusting hypocrites they are
[41:21.000 --> 41:24.000]  now shifting gears again you mentioned the drug war
[41:24.000 --> 41:27.000]  what a battle with all 14 states trying to decriminalize
[41:27.000 --> 41:30.000]  or legalize marijuana Obama doing all the raids
[41:30.000 --> 41:32.000]  whatever happened to states rights
[41:32.000 --> 41:35.000]  Obama claimed he was going to decriminalize marijuana
[41:35.000 --> 41:38.000]  another lie give us your take on what I cut you off about
[41:38.000 --> 41:41.000]  for the break and then I want to tie it into this actor
[41:41.000 --> 41:44.000]  who had heroin laced with painkiller I can't pronounce this
[41:44.000 --> 41:47.000]  how do you say it fentanyl
[41:47.000 --> 41:50.000]  takes toll on Pennsylvania killing people and they're also
[41:50.000 --> 41:53.000]  getting almost pure heroin out of Afghanistan 10 fold
[41:53.000 --> 41:56.000]  increase on heroin going into western Europe
[41:56.000 --> 41:59.000]  in the US since the liberation of Afghanistan
[41:59.000 --> 42:02.000]  12 years ago Philip Seymour Hoffman was found
[42:02.000 --> 42:05.000]  dead in New York City with a needle in his
[42:05.000 --> 42:08.000]  arm and I'm just like Mike Adams has a great article
[42:08.000 --> 42:11.000]  and naturalnews.com it's also an info wars.com
[42:11.000 --> 42:14.000]  overdose death of Hoffman underscores urgent need
[42:14.000 --> 42:17.000]  to decriminalize and regulate recreational drugs northern Europe
[42:17.000 --> 42:20.000]  five countries there have decriminalized heroin
[42:20.000 --> 42:23.000]  so you can get medical grade in controlled dosages
[42:23.000 --> 42:26.000]  and almost no overdoses are happening now
[42:26.000 --> 42:29.000]  and drug use has gone down about 50% because you take
[42:29.000 --> 42:31.000]  the black market out of it everything you've said
[42:31.000 --> 42:33.000]  Governor give us your take on all this
[42:33.000 --> 42:36.000]  absolutely you know when it's like my mother
[42:36.000 --> 42:39.000]  said to me my mom passed away back in
[42:39.000 --> 42:42.000]  1995 but she lived through the prohibition
[42:42.000 --> 42:45.000]  of alcohol when they went through that nonsense
[42:45.000 --> 42:48.000]  way back in the 20s and early 30s
[42:48.000 --> 42:51.000]  where they prohibited alcohol and my mom's
[42:51.000 --> 42:54.000]  observation was she told me she said the war on drugs
[42:54.000 --> 42:57.000]  is identical to the prohibition of alcohol all you're
[42:57.000 --> 43:00.000]  doing is making criminals rich and powerful
[43:00.000 --> 43:03.000]  and that's precisely it clearly some
[43:03.000 --> 43:06.000]  people within our government are profiting
[43:06.000 --> 43:09.000]  greatly from keeping drugs illegal
[43:09.000 --> 43:12.000]  by smuggling them in the prices
[43:12.000 --> 43:15.000]  are then 10 times higher than they normally be
[43:15.000 --> 43:18.000]  I mean let's look at tobacco and alcohol
[43:18.000 --> 43:21.000]  those two are drugs there's no doubt about it
[43:21.000 --> 43:24.000]  but for some reason they separate them from all the other
[43:24.000 --> 43:27.000]  ones because they're number one they're legal
[43:27.000 --> 43:30.000]  well tobacco and alcohol causes much damage
[43:30.000 --> 43:33.000]  or more damage than all the quote illegal
[43:33.000 --> 43:36.000]  drugs do combined more people die from
[43:36.000 --> 43:39.000]  alcohol and tobacco every year than what
[43:39.000 --> 43:42.000]  die from any of these other drugs in fact
[43:42.000 --> 43:45.000]  illegal drugs medical prescription drugs
[43:45.000 --> 43:48.000]  more people die from those overdoses
[43:48.000 --> 43:51.000]  of drugs you get from your doctor then
[43:51.000 --> 43:54.000]  die from these alleged illegal recreational
[43:54.000 --> 43:57.000]  drugs and the point of the matter is
[43:57.000 --> 44:00.000]  if you live in a free society
[44:00.000 --> 44:03.000]  drug addiction is a medical problem
[44:03.000 --> 44:06.000]  why we have chose to make it a criminal
[44:06.000 --> 44:09.000]  problem I have no idea why we somehow
[44:09.000 --> 44:12.000]  think you should take an addict and throw them in
[44:12.000 --> 44:15.000]  prison is beyond me you can achieve
[44:15.000 --> 44:18.000]  so much more by legalizing it
[44:18.000 --> 44:21.000]  taxing it using those revenues
[44:21.000 --> 44:24.000]  then you get a hold on who the addicts
[44:24.000 --> 44:27.000]  are and you can attempt to cure them
[44:27.000 --> 44:30.000]  you can attempt to make them good citizens
[44:30.000 --> 44:33.000]  who are productive again and
[44:33.000 --> 44:36.000]  they won't have to be out
[44:36.000 --> 44:39.000]  facing buying addictive substances
[44:39.000 --> 44:42.000]  that are charged ten times more than what they should
[44:42.000 --> 44:45.000]  cost and that leads to other crimes
[44:45.000 --> 44:48.000]  if an addict has to fulfill his addiction
[44:48.000 --> 44:51.000]  and the price is ten times
[44:51.000 --> 44:54.000]  you don't see people robbing stores at gunpoint
[44:54.000 --> 44:57.000]  to get money for tobacco and alcohol
[44:57.000 --> 45:00.000]  well the same thing would hold true if the other drugs
[45:00.000 --> 45:03.000]  are put at a decent price you put them
[45:03.000 --> 45:06.000]  in hospitals and in pharmacies
[45:06.000 --> 45:09.000]  in places you don't sell them in 7-eleven stores
[45:09.000 --> 45:12.000]  but you put them in places where people can come admit
[45:12.000 --> 45:15.000]  their addiction be able to buy what they need
[45:15.000 --> 45:18.000]  then you at least get a grasp on ok
[45:18.000 --> 45:21.000]  now can we wean this person off of the drug
[45:21.000 --> 45:24.000]  and I think that in 9 times out of 10
[45:24.000 --> 45:27.000]  the addict would go for that
[45:27.000 --> 45:30.000]  the addict would go to stop being controlled by this drug
[45:30.000 --> 45:33.000]  but the only way that's going to happen is through legalization
[45:33.000 --> 45:36.000]  it's not going to happen through prohibition
[45:36.000 --> 45:39.000]  and people need to wake up to that fact
[45:39.000 --> 45:42.000]  that could be a university dissertation
[45:42.000 --> 45:45.000]  that was perfectly said with all the facts
[45:45.000 --> 45:48.000]  look at prohibition ending
[45:48.000 --> 45:51.000]  in the early 30s and the police had been corrupted
[45:51.000 --> 45:54.000]  alcoholism had tripled, billions had been made
[45:54.000 --> 45:57.000]  by the mafia and corrupt groups
[45:57.000 --> 46:00.000]  and so they literally went and lobbied
[46:00.000 --> 46:03.000]  the well-meaning Christian PTAs and people
[46:03.000 --> 46:06.000]  to go all over the country and get drug laws
[46:06.000 --> 46:09.000]  state and federal passed where they'd put you in jail for 20 years
[46:09.000 --> 46:12.000]  with a cigarette so that they had something new to deal
[46:12.000 --> 46:15.000]  and then women need it because it's so expensive
[46:15.000 --> 46:18.000]  so they become prostitutes and the local government
[46:18.000 --> 46:21.000]  thugs can run that. I mean this is all a racket
[46:21.000 --> 46:24.000]  and everybody knows it and I don't see
[46:24.000 --> 46:27.000]  how long the drug war can go as the public
[46:27.000 --> 46:30.000]  all the polls show what decriminalization
[46:30.000 --> 46:33.000]  across the board Jesse. Well then what you've got to do
[46:33.000 --> 46:36.000]  Alex is simple you have to start electing people
[46:36.000 --> 46:39.000]  to be with that position. I remember when I ran
[46:39.000 --> 46:42.000]  for governor of Minnesota during the election
[46:42.000 --> 46:45.000]  I brought out I made a simple statement
[46:45.000 --> 46:48.000]  I said it's time to look at legalizing drugs and prostitution
[46:48.000 --> 46:51.000]  oh my god the head of the
[46:51.000 --> 46:54.000]  of the independence party of Minnesota went ballistic
[46:54.000 --> 46:57.000]  she thought I had blown the whole election
[46:57.000 --> 47:00.000]  she goes oh we were contending now we
[47:00.000 --> 47:03.000]  opened his mouth on drugs and prostitution
[47:03.000 --> 47:06.000]  so who is the election it's all lost
[47:06.000 --> 47:09.000]  and I'll never forget my partner Dean Barkley
[47:09.000 --> 47:12.000]  who was instrumental in getting me to run for governor
[47:12.000 --> 47:15.000]  Dean walked into the room and sat down and smiled
[47:15.000 --> 47:18.000]  very calmly and says look how do we take this
[47:18.000 --> 47:21.000]  lemon and turn it into lemonade and he came up
[47:21.000 --> 47:24.000]  with a great idea and it worked he said
[47:24.000 --> 47:27.000]  we're going to come out through with the position
[47:27.000 --> 47:30.000]  Jesse Ventura is the only candidate with the courage to talk about
[47:30.000 --> 47:33.000]  issues because drug addiction is real
[47:33.000 --> 47:36.000]  prostitution is real and he's not afraid
[47:36.000 --> 47:39.000]  to discuss real life situations
[47:39.000 --> 47:42.000]  and what the regular public is doing
[47:42.000 --> 47:45.000]  but I mean exactly there's women everywhere that you take them out to dinner
[47:45.000 --> 47:48.000]  and you pay their bills they don't call that prostitution
[47:48.000 --> 47:51.000]  and what makes it horrible and I'm not endorsing it
[47:51.000 --> 47:54.000]  is the fact that there are pimps it is illegal
[47:54.000 --> 47:57.000]  these women are being suppressed by it being a black market
[47:57.000 --> 48:00.000]  and all the studies show that
[48:00.000 --> 48:03.000]  Oh absolutely well Alex when you look at prostitution
[48:03.000 --> 48:06.000]  and you strip it all away okay in our free society
[48:06.000 --> 48:09.000]  any sexual act
[48:09.000 --> 48:12.000]  between two consenting adults is legal
[48:12.000 --> 48:15.000]  so the only illegality about prostitution
[48:15.000 --> 48:18.000]  the government's not getting the cut
[48:18.000 --> 48:21.000]  they're not paying taxes
[48:21.000 --> 48:24.000]  the government wants to be the pimp
[48:24.000 --> 48:27.000]  and so you know that's all part of it
[48:27.000 --> 48:30.000]  to follow the money how the sex act itself
[48:30.000 --> 48:33.000]  is not illegal so clearly it's the money
[48:33.000 --> 48:36.000]  and then you run into a different scenario
[48:36.000 --> 48:39.000]  let's take a pornographic actor
[48:39.000 --> 48:42.000]  someone who does pornography on TV
[48:42.000 --> 48:45.000]  for money is that not having sex for money
[48:45.000 --> 48:48.000]  how is it they're not arrested
[48:48.000 --> 48:51.000]  is that not considered prostitution
[48:51.000 --> 48:54.000]  they're having sex and they're getting paid to do it
[48:54.000 --> 48:57.000]  it's just that they're doing it on film
[48:57.000 --> 49:00.000]  so I guess it's considered an artistic form
[49:00.000 --> 49:03.000]  well said well the bottom line is
[49:03.000 --> 49:06.000]  well pornography is not illegal and prostitution is
[49:06.000 --> 49:09.000]  how can that be
[49:09.000 --> 49:12.000]  well I just know all the studies from around the world it's incontrovertible
[49:12.000 --> 49:15.000]  you make something illegal that's a vice
[49:15.000 --> 49:18.000]  that doesn't hurt non-consenting people
[49:18.000 --> 49:21.000]  you then make it dark, make it corrupt, make it black market
[49:21.000 --> 49:24.000]  put tons of money into it and now the mafia
[49:24.000 --> 49:27.000]  and the corrupt government and the police
[49:27.000 --> 49:30.000]  get to run it and that's why they want illegal
[49:30.000 --> 49:33.000]  so that they can run it on the dark side period
[49:33.000 --> 49:36.000]  well and it's also so that the prices will go up
[49:36.000 --> 49:39.000]  anything that's legal the price drops
[49:39.000 --> 49:42.000]  you watch in Colorado and Washington
[49:42.000 --> 49:45.000]  how eventually the price of marijuana
[49:45.000 --> 49:48.000]  is going to drop there where it's legal
[49:48.000 --> 49:51.000]  because there will be competition
[49:51.000 --> 49:54.000]  there will be growers of marijuana who will decide
[49:54.000 --> 49:57.000]  you know what I'll undercut the price
[49:57.000 --> 50:00.000]  and I'll sell more then because my marijuana will be cheaper
[50:00.000 --> 50:03.000]  and that's called good clean competition
[50:03.000 --> 50:06.000]  in capitalism that's what drives
[50:06.000 --> 50:09.000]  prices down is competition
[50:09.000 --> 50:12.000]  and by legalizing marijuana
[50:12.000 --> 50:15.000]  and then let's look at it from a different standpoint
[50:15.000 --> 50:18.000]  for those that think Jesse might be crazy
[50:18.000 --> 50:21.000]  or Alex is crazy, marijuana itself
[50:21.000 --> 50:24.000]  is the best that you can get
[50:24.000 --> 50:27.000]  for creating biodiesel fuel
[50:27.000 --> 50:29.000]  and then we can stop using corn
[50:29.000 --> 50:32.000]  and use marijuana and let corn be what it's supposed to
[50:32.000 --> 50:35.000]  well that's right, ham grows everywhere as well and most strains don't even have THC
[50:35.000 --> 50:38.000]  final segment with Jesse Ventura and we've got the exclusive
[50:38.000 --> 50:41.000]  I'll hold him into the next hour after Ventura has to go
[50:41.000 --> 50:44.000]  but Jesse you're going to get a chance to talk
[50:44.000 --> 50:47.000]  to Matthew Mills on the other side
[50:47.000 --> 50:50.000]  he's a listener and we were able to get him on
[50:50.000 --> 50:53.000]  the guy that took over the NFL post game
[50:53.000 --> 50:56.000]  Super Bowl Sunday showed us that there basically
[50:56.000 --> 51:22.000]  no such thing as security, he's coming up with Jesse Ventura
[51:22.000 --> 51:26.000]  goberky.com or call 877-886-3653
[51:26.000 --> 51:54.000]  helping thousands prepare since 2005, goberky.com
[51:54.000 --> 52:04.000]  by now you may know that a bitcoin is the first decentralized currency

[53:58.000 --> 54:00.000]  now
[54:19.000 --> 54:22.000]  now, I always imagine myself making great plays but
[54:22.000 --> 54:24.000]  you never think about being MVP
[54:24.000 --> 54:31.000]  investigate 9-11, 9-11 was perpetrated by people within our own government
[54:31.000 --> 54:36.000]  and just those 15 seconds have now become a sensation
[54:36.000 --> 54:40.000]  all over the news as they attack him but as it causes the debate
[54:40.000 --> 54:43.000]  I'm going to hold him a little bit in the next hour after Governor Jesse Ventura leaves us
[54:43.000 --> 54:47.000]  but Jesse, he's a listener, he's been able to get in
[54:47.000 --> 54:50.000]  and we're going to talk to Matthew Mills, what do you want to say to him Governor?
[54:50.000 --> 54:58.000]  well Matthew, I want to say, you know, unbelievable the courage you show and good for you to speak your mind
[54:58.000 --> 55:05.000]  I would ask this question of what are they going to do to you or what are they doing to you for what you just did
[55:05.000 --> 55:07.000]  am I on here right now?
[55:07.000 --> 55:09.000]  yes you are, go ahead sir
[55:09.000 --> 55:13.000]  I don't think they're going to do much to me, I only got like a stomach, a ticket
[55:13.000 --> 55:16.000]  I don't even think it's for that much money
[55:16.000 --> 55:20.000]  they grilled me for a while, they were really really intense
[55:20.000 --> 55:24.000]  it was pretty much everything but the spotlight in my face, they were real
[55:24.000 --> 55:28.000]  the one guy actually said he wanted to punch me in my jaw
[55:28.000 --> 55:32.000]  so they were kind of mad but I don't think I'm going to get any big trouble
[55:32.000 --> 55:42.000]  that's amazing, what's been the repercussion for you either media that want to talk to you or are they marginalizing you and not talking to you?
[55:42.000 --> 55:51.000]  well I got a bunch of calls yesterday but I was in the holding cell in the stadium until pretty late at night until pretty much the stadium closed
[55:51.000 --> 56:01.000]  and I had a bunch of texts and calls and then one guy I finally answered it was from nj.com and he just asked me some questions and I was candid with him
[56:01.000 --> 56:07.000]  that's right, you got interviewed by the New Jersey local paper there in the main city
[56:07.000 --> 56:12.000]  listen, can you hold and after the governor leaves us I'm going to come back and debrief you on air?
[56:12.000 --> 56:13.000]  sure
[56:13.000 --> 56:19.000]  thank you for calling in, our listener taking action, he's done work with We Are Change in the past as well and he is one hell of an info warrior
[56:19.000 --> 56:22.000]  I tell you it's great to be part of this family of freedom fighters Jesse
[56:22.000 --> 56:30.000]  oh I'll tell you this kid had courage and guts to do what he did and that's remarkable because just those simple words he said
[56:30.000 --> 56:38.000]  and now the media jumping all over it is bringing it back into the forefront back to the attention of the people of throughout the world
[56:38.000 --> 56:45.000]  which is a good thing because we've never gotten resolution on 9-11 just as we've never gotten it on the murder of John Kennedy
[56:45.000 --> 56:48.000]  and that's enough of this crap we deserve to know the truth
[56:48.000 --> 56:56.000]  oh by the way I went to Dallas, the Dallas police didn't follow the orders of the mayor to have anybody handing out flyers anywhere downtown to be arrested
[56:56.000 --> 57:01.000]  so they hired Homeland Security hired sheriff's deputies to basically punch us and attack us on video
[57:01.000 --> 57:05.000]  I don't know if you heard about that but it was online and made national news
[57:05.000 --> 57:11.000]  this was after the memorial and everybody was gone, the police opened up the barricades and you can go in now to downtown
[57:11.000 --> 57:15.000]  and the feds had sheriff's deputies attack us
[57:15.000 --> 57:23.000]  well and all of that because we don't believe the official story
[57:23.000 --> 57:29.000]  well it's just like they censored your TV show it's just like they're afraid of the information which shows we have power
[57:29.000 --> 57:34.000]  I'll tell you it's amazing that they still try to perpetrate this myth on killing of Kennedy
[57:34.000 --> 57:40.000]  I mean anybody today who believes Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone is completely naive
[57:40.000 --> 57:46.000]  there's so much packed out there there's so much you can learn about it to know that it's not true
[57:46.000 --> 57:53.000]  and I always tell people it's the most important thing because that's what's led to where we're at today
[57:53.000 --> 57:59.000]  and Jack Kennedy lived I believe we would be living in a different world than what we live in today
[57:59.000 --> 58:06.000]  they killed everybody that stood for peace because obviously there are people in the world that do not want peace
[58:06.000 --> 58:09.000]  they want war and it's that simple Alex
[58:09.000 --> 58:16.000]  great way to end it the TV shows on aura.tv forward slash off the grid you can also just Google Jesse Ventura YouTube
[58:16.000 --> 58:20.000]  he's got Facebook all of it we have it all linked up on info wars.com
[58:20.000 --> 58:26.000]  Governor look forward to seeing you when you're back in the States and I'll take you up on the invitation to come down and see you in Mexico
[58:26.000 --> 58:28.000]  say hi to your wife and family for me
[58:28.000 --> 58:33.000]  thank you Alex just when you come down when you come down though don't bring no drones with ya
[58:33.000 --> 58:35.000]  we'll see you off the grid Governor
[58:35.000 --> 58:38.000]  take care we'll be right back with a man that took over the Super Bowl

[58:43.000 --> 58:50.000]  visit GCNLive.com today
[58:50.000 --> 58:55.000]  why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare
[58:55.000 --> 58:58.000]  why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet
[58:58.000 --> 59:00.000]  the highest rates of diabetes
[59:00.000 --> 59:01.000]  autism
[59:01.000 --> 59:04.000]  and every other major disease
[59:04.000 --> 59:06.000]  it all comes down to one thing
[59:06.000 --> 59:08.000]  we are what we eat
[59:08.000 --> 59:12.000]  our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives
[59:12.000 --> 59:16.000]  our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff
[59:16.000 --> 59:19.000]  all of this has been engineered by design
[59:19.000 --> 59:22.000]  we can turn the tide against the eugenicist

[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:30.000]  All right, Joel Scousen
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:34.000]  Korean Corps fighter pilot aviator from the Vietnam era
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.000]  best-selling author, researcher, his uncle of course Cleon Scousen
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000]  wrote The Naked Communist
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:43.000]  really one of the seminal works exposing how the ultra-rich used communism and socialism
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:46.000]  as a political tool of slavery
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:49.000]  and of course he's the editor-in-chief of World Affairs Brief
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.000]  four or five days ago I said I want to get him on
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000]  and it was about Russia and it was about the economy
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:57.000]  and it was about China threatening to nuke the US
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000]  and the sellout of our technology
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000]  and I can't remember why I wanted to get him on now
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:04.000]  there was one particular reason it'll pop my head in a moment
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:07.000]  but the point is he can speak to all the stuff
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:10.000]  that's going on in the world
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000]  and then I can go over the news with him
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:15.000]  about what's happening in the world
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:20.000]  the entire neocon slash liberal combine
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:23.000]  what's open borders, what the plan is with that
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:26.000]  and where he thinks we are societally
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:29.000]  so again we have him via Skype
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000]  and we'll also be going back and forth with phone
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:34.000]  when his Skype drops
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:39.000]  Joel Scousen thank you for coming on with us
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000]  oh his Skype dropped as well
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000]  I tell you Joel's just awesome
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:46.000]  but sometimes he's got technical issues
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000]  but hey it's the wonder of technology
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:52.000]  that we can even talk to somebody at a distance
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:55.000]  so that's always good
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000]  I'm sure we want to get the message across to him
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:00.000]  to be on phone and Skype at the same time
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000]  that that's the key
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000]  but I'll talk to him during the break
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000]  but we'll be discussing that with Joel Scousen
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:09.000]  by the way I should mention this to everybody
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000]  the subscription side of InfoWars magazine
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000]  has been very very successful
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:16.000]  but it's really a tool just to get bulk magazines out
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000]  and that was so much more successful
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.000]  if you didn't subscribe last month
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000]  you will never get a subscription to this
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.000]  we're not going to get rid of it in 12 months
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:23.000]  we're going to continue with the bulk
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.000]  and bulk making of it
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000]  I love the magazine it's very successful
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:29.000]  but having 12 shipping
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000]  shipping at 12 times
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.000]  that was like more than half the cost
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000]  paying for the shipping each time
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000]  because you can't get media mail in a newspaper
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000]  or a magazine
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:42.000]  even at $39.95 12 issues delivered
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000]  it's just so much more inexpensive
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.000]  to sell these in bulk
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:50.000]  we can ship you 10 of these
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000]  at cost for a little bit more
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000]  than it would be to have the subscription each month
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.000]  so that's what we're doing
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000]  get it it's a big glossy color magazine
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000]  the February issue is out
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:03.000]  and then you've got a big double cover glossy magazine
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000]  full of the most important articles of the month
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:06.000]  and original articles
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000]  this one deals with the heart and soul of the police
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000]  and the battle by the globalists
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000]  to turn them into third world enforcer thugs
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:16.000]  and our battle to try to wake them up
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:19.000]  how the police can be devils or angels
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000]  and how the globalists are trying to turn them
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:22.000]  to the dark side
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000]  how we need to fight to take back control of our police
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000]  from the feds themselves that have been captured
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:27.000]  by the globalists
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:30.000]  and there's a bunch of other key articles
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000]  and letters to the editors
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:37.000]  and so much more in the magazine
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:41.000]  but this is again a very important issue
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:44.000]  dealing with the police throughout it
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:48.000]  that I'm really really really proud of
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000]  and it's great to give police that you know
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000]  it's almost kind of like an officer Jack McClam
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000]  vampire killer 2000
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:57.000]  2.0 showing good things police are doing
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000]  and examples of good police
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:03.000]  versus examples of the militarization
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000]  of police that the globalists
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000]  have basically created
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000]  so I'm very proud of the 64 page magazine
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000]  it doesn't just get into the police
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000]  the militarization of police worldwide
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.000]  it gets into DHS
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000]  gave Muslim Brotherhood VIP treatment
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000]  no TSA Patnouns
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.000]  it's got oh my favorite
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:22.000]  the giant double America spread
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:25.000]  with Leanne McAdoo holding twin 50 calibers
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000]  pretty strong girl that will do that
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:30.000]  with just pure Americana in the background
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000]  absolutely sure to
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000]  it's America, not America, America
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000]  got the bald eagle landing there
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.000]  this is just pure Americana
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000]  if you show a trendy this
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.000]  or a socialist this
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000]  or a so-called feminist this

[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:05.000]  iodine has been phased out of our staple foods
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000]  and replaced with the halogen bromine
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:11.000]  a practice now banned in nations around the world

[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:19.000]  in 1924 the federal government did the right thing
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:22.000]  and encouraged salt producers to add iodine
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:25.000]  it's the good halogen on the periodic table
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000]  and the results are on record

[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000]  Alex Jones
[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:29.000]  I wanted to get Joe Scousen on last week
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:32.000]  because I was re-reading over the naked communist
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:36.000]  on Wikipedia that has the goals of communism
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:39.000]  and when a lot of the Soviet archives got declassified
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.000]  in the 90s
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:43.000]  indeed these were official communist goals
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:46.000]  that Cleon Scousen, his uncle
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:47.000]  was able to get
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000]  so I wanted to get him on about this
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000]  because when you see the Grammys
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:54.000]  with multiple satanic rituals going on
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:55.000]  and I know some of the people involved
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:56.000]  they're very serious
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000]  Lady Gaga, all of them actually believe
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000]  they're being attacked by demons
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000]  I mean these people, whether you believe it's real
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.000]  or psychological
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:04.000]  it's still an archetype
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000]  they're manifesting this mental illness
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:09.000]  and other authoritarian regimes are always
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:10.000]  occult-driven
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:11.000]  Hitler was into the occult
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:14.000]  the Babylonians, the Egyptians, the Romans
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000]  they serve the same archetype
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000]  even if you don't believe in God
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000]  they are manifesting the same spirit
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:21.000]  so it's real one way or the other
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000]  and of course I know it's spiritual
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000]  now we've got his nephew on
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:26.000]  who's an author
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000]  and of course former Marine Corps
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000]  fighter pilot in the Vietnam era
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000]  heads up worldaffairsbrief.com
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:35.000]  Joel Scousen via Skype and phone
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000]  in case either one cuts out
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000]  you'll hear different audio quality
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000]  back and forth today
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000]  he joins us because I wanted to get him on
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000]  in the first half of the hour
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000]  about the communist goals
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000]  and how mega-rich
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000]  fund communism and socialism
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:52.000]  as a tool of control
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000]  because people get confused by that
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000]  why does George Soros fund socialism and communism
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000]  why did the New York banks fund
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:09:59.000]  the Bolshevik Revolution on record
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000]  that was in congressional testimonies
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000]  and came out in documents
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000]  in multiple committees
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000]  what are the big foundations up to
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000]  capture both of the political parties
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:10.000]  of the United States
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000]  use technical decisions
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000]  of the courts to weaken basic American institutions
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:15.000]  by claiming their activities
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000]  violate civil laws
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000]  use fake civil rights to trump
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000]  basic human rights and God-given rights
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:22.000]  get control of the schools
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000]  use them as a transmission belts
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000]  for socialism and current communist propaganda
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:27.000]  soften the curriculum
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000]  use student riots to
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000]  foment public protest
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000]  infiltrate the press get control of book reviews
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000]  continue discrediting
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000]  American culture and now it's been
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000]  declassified the CIA would put out
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000]  decadent art
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000]  to then basically
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000]  then discredit beautiful art
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000]  and again now you turn
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000]  on any children's show any movie
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000]  it's meant to sell you
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000]  on ugliness to where now
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000]  anything good and pure it's not
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000]  enough to accept gays now no
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000]  no being straight is bad we're told
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000]  in the news
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000]  you see it everywhere
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000]  and again this is done as the subversion
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000]  program first they
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000]  want to subvert then they want to
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000]  basically undermine the society
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000]  they want to
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000]  collapse the society
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000]  and then reorganize it
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000]  so we are literally
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000]  seeing saboteur operations
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000]  going on and then you understand
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000]  these are not liberals folks they knew
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000]  Obamacare would hurt poor people
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000]  they knew it would
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000]  bankrupt the country they want full control
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000]  they hate the masses communist
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000]  at the top are never really communists
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000]  they are banker technicians
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000]  conning the unwashed masses
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000]  so I wanted him to break down
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000]  the program
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000]  that you know came out
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000]  that they now
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000]  discredit the American founding fathers
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000]  that's number 30 present them as selfish
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000]  aristocrats who had no concern
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000]  for the common man when it was the opposite
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000]  they hadn't fully realized
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000]  these dreams but they were the first to really
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000]  put it in paper and move it
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000]  forward
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000]  and so he joins us now to talk about that
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000]  then at the bottom of the hour I want to get into
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000]  the geopolitical outlook the economy
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000]  the Russians the Chinese
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000]  what's happening in the Middle East
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000]  the major buildup for
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000]  continued authoritarianism
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000]  but the huge awakening we see
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000]  unfolding with Joel Scalzen
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000]  and when I told him I wanted you on a few
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000]  days ago I hope they relayed that it was about
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000]  this but I know you're an expert on it
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000]  so you can speak to it but now
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000]  who can deny they're trying to undermine
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000]  culture and any good institutions
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000]  so they can collapse them
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000]  and bring in a total takeover
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000]  Joel Scalzen
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000]  well thanks Alex it's good to be with
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000]  it's good to be with you
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000]  one of the things that I want to point out at the
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000]  inception here as I've gone through
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000]  the 45 goals that
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000]  claim extracted from communist writings
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000]  it's important to realize that you won't
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000]  find this listed anywhere in communist
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000]  literature in other words
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000]  this was in bits and pieces
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000]  for various different communist writers
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000]  at the time and actually
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000]  only about half of them have come
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000]  true and what's
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000]  most interesting and you've mentioned
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000]  some of those especially and I might mention
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000]  getting
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000]  you in recognition for Red China
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000]  replacing Taiwan
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000]  was a communist goal doing away
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000]  with all loyalty owes
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000]  resisting any attempt to outlaw
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000]  the commons party all those that have been done
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000]  Russian access
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000]  continued access to the US pattern office
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000]  they did not
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000]  however able to capture both
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000]  political parties
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000]  that is for the communist party
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000]  they were not able
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000]  to get control of the schools per se
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000]  but the schools have been under
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000]  the control of what we would call globalist
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000]  and this is the most interesting thing about
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000]  what's happened is that when I look at the list
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000]  of what
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000]  they were able to accomplish out of these 45
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000]  goals the half that approximately
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000]  that were able to be achieved
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000]  were not achieved by communists
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000]  but they were achieved by
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000]  non-communist globalist
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000]  and socialist and left
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000]  to some liberals in the United States
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000]  who all shared the same
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000]  you know philosophy
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000]  that's the key is that the Carnegie Endowment
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000]  the Ford Endowment as you know
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000]  had helped fund the Bolshevik Revolution
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000]  and all the rest of it so it wasn't that
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000]  they were imitating the communists
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000]  it was that they had been the progenitors
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000]  of that movement going back
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000]  even to the 1850s
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000]  as a way to control rebellions by serfs
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000]  against one form of slavery
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000]  they were now going to bring in another
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000]  and so the Russians
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000]  and the KGB and others were actually working
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000]  for some of the same goals as
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000]  the western establishment as Carol Quigley wrote
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000]  and for example
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000]  on the infiltration of the press
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000]  I mean you know in the 40s
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000]  and there were quite a few communists
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000]  in the press
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000]  but even some of the major communists
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000]  that the Whitaker Chamber
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000]  exposed like Alger Hiss
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000]  turned out to be a globalist who only joined
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000]  the Communist Party to facilitate
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000]  bringing them into the State Department
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000]  and to make the communists feel like they had
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000]  one of their people at the top levels
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000]  of the Roosevelt administration
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000]  and Truman administration
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000]  but in fact he was a globalist facilitating these things
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000]  and that's what
[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000]  people have to understand
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000]  is that this has brought support
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000]  among anyone who's
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000]  basically on the receiving end of satanic inspiration
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000]  and it includes
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000]  conspiracies
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000]  it includes unthinking liberals
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000]  it includes
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000]  the gay community
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000]  that's what you're getting at is there's an energizing
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000]  spirit throughout history
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000]  that weaves the same web
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000]  that's right
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000]  and you know
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000]  I know a lot of people don't believe in God
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000]  a lot of people don't believe in Satan
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000]  but they're both very very real
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000]  and they both speak to people's minds
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000]  it comes in our own voice
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000]  comes in your own grammar
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000]  so it sounds like you're talking to yourself
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000]  but people know
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000]  people recognize when temptation
[01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000]  comes in and when good inspiration
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000]  and good reminders come
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000]  and this is the battle of civilization
[01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000]  the test that's going on in each people's mind
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000]  of what voice are we listening to
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000]  and they don't have to be full communists
[01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000]  to be listening to a voice that will
[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000]  denigrate culture, denigrate society
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000]  and rail against
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000]  even I ran, it was a libertarian
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000]  railed against God
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000]  she hated God
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000]  she hated that voice of conscience
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000]  which spoke out against her immorality
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000]  and her lust and other things
[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000]  and other people who get involved in sin
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000]  have the same problem
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000]  that's why there is a relationship
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000]  between bad judgment and sin
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000]  and the kind of hateful philosophies
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000]  that are end up being created
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000]  in the minds of men
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000]  by listening to the wrong sources
[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000]  and so it's very interesting
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000]  that this could be a list equally
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000]  as useful to globalists
[01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000]  as liberals, as communists
[01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000]  even though they aren't members
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000]  of the communist party
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000]  but in the 90s
[01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000]  it did come out almost all of these
[01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000]  goals one way or another
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000]  were actually being carried out to subvert
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000]  but then we learned the CIA
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000]  as was declassified last year
[01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000]  was involved trying to put out trash art
[01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000]  and trash culture, well that's obvious
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000]  when look what they did at the Grammys
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000]  and now every other public event
[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000]  they're having open satanic ceremonies
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000]  and gay marriages
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000]  I mean there is an agenda there
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000]  I mean since when is that what America is known for
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000]  is satanic ceremonies
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000]  and gay marriages
[01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000]  one of the things that you brought
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000]  to the public attention
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000]  was the Bohemian Grove
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000]  and the satanic rituals there
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000]  and you have top politicians
[01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000]  and leaders in the United States
[01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000]  being invited and participating in that
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000]  so it's hard to separate
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000]  the satanic element
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000]  that's driving this force
[01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000]  and the various superficial organizations
[01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000]  that are created
[01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000]  and there are many of them
[01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000]  whether it's the Bilderberg group
[01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000]  Council on Correlation
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000]  exactly and when I was in Bohemian Grove
[01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000]  you could say it was a joke
[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000]  a bunch of guys reenacting an ancient Babylonian ritual
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000]  mixed in with some druidic rituals
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000]  but
[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000]  the old men in the crowd
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000]  I talked to them, oh this is interesting
[01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000]  and they literally growled at me
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000]  they were in focused
[01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000]  hateful religious rapture
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000]  and
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000]  some of them had tears coming out of their eyes
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000]  Joel
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000]  I'm sorry to you
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000]  well I can believe that
[01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000]  these people, we have to remember
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000]  what drives
[01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000]  so many people to get involved in this control system
[01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000]  is the promise of immunity
[01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000]  this is a powerful system
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000]  that controls courts
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000]  it controls congressmen
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000]  it controls the president
[01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000]  man you're smart, the whole ritual was about immunity
[01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000]  they thought they were getting immunity in that ritual
[01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000]  that's what they were doing
[01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000]  exactly
[01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000]  not only immunity on this earth
[01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000]  and we see that happen all the time
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000]  Bill Clinton and the president acted as if
[01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000]  hey nobody can touch me and he was right
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000]  nobody could touch him
[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000]  because he was on the right side
[01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000]  on the control side
[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000]  but I think in terms of the satanic ritual
[01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000]  I think there's also part of the Fausti impact
[01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000]  is the promise of immunity
[01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000]  from God's judgment
[01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000]  and that's what I think
[01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000]  Isaiah 14 is all about
[01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000]  when all the rich men
[01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000]  of the world are sitting in chains in hell
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000]  waiting for him
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000]  that was going to thrash the world to come down
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000]  and save them
[01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000]  and then they see him defend and change
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000]  and they say art thou become one of us
[01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000]  meaning Satan
[01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000]  descends and they realize all the immunity
[01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000]  pact is broken he isn't going to be able
[01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000]  to save us
[01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000]  I think that's what Isaiah was talking about
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000]  unbelievably powerful let's come back and discuss that
[01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000]  I bring up communism he brings up the devil
[01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000]  because Lenin said he worshiped the devil
[01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000]  I mean that's what
[01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000]  is at the bottom of the rabbit hole folks
[01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000]  whether you believe in the devil or not
[01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000]  these people believe in him

[01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:37.000]  Alright, Joe Scals, this is a short segment long segment coming up to get into geopolitics
[01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000]  everyone that I know
[01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000]  has a serious feeling in their gut of concern
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000]  it's increasing
[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000]  I've never had so much concern
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000]  and I think of the globalist what fools they are
[01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:51.000]  and I instinctively at a spiritual level
[01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000]  know that
[01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000]  the big sin is leading people astray
[01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000]  trying to get people into evil
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:01.000]  trying to take advantage of childlike minds as Christ said
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000]  suffer the little children
[01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000]  we're not just talking about children there
[01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000]  we're talking about young people
[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000]  folks that are looking up to you
[01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000]  and you talk about God fearing
[01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000]  I just feel it in my spirit
[01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000]  if something's bad
[01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000]  if you do it, thinking about it
[01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000]  even to study it makes me
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000]  have fear of separation from God
[01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000]  not that I'm some great goody-to-sure or anything
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000]  but I don't do conscious evil
[01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000]  and I have a drive to stand up against evil
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000]  and that's why I don't have fear of it
[01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000]  I have fear of letting it take over
[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000]  but I think about what fools the worldly are
[01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000]  they either hate God because they feel the judgment
[01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000]  even if they say God isn't real
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000]  or they do
[01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000]  literally at Bohemian Grove
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000]  it conducts all these rituals
[01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000]  in a way to absolve them
[01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000]  from the care
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000]  and what they've done in the last year
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000]  and they take it very seriously
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000]  as if some satanic ritual
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000]  is going to get them out of what they've done
[01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000]  I mean even in the real world
[01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000]  when they allow radiation
[01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000]  out of Fukushima it hits their kids in them as well
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000]  I mean they may get a few get out of jail free cards
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000]  but this is the height of delusion
[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000]  but you're right it's the heart
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000]  of the world
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000]  is about escaping judgment
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000]  that just seems so mindless
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000]  I mean a 5 year old
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000]  should know you can't escape judgment forever
[01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000]  we have to remember
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000]  that these people have a great motivation
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000]  to escape judgment
[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000]  they've got a mountain of sins
[01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000]  and they've got a mountain of evil intent
[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000]  as well
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000]  and what keeps them going is the fact
[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000]  that someone is promising
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000]  immunity and they really do act as if
[01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000]  I mean let me
[01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000]  point out from another point of view
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000]  to this question
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000]  how is it that the globalist
[01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000]  the most wealthy man in the world
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000]  with all the ownership of factories
[01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000]  and major inroads into big corporations
[01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000]  why would they bring upon the nation
[01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000]  and induce a Russian and Chinese
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000]  nuclear attack
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000]  knowing that it's going to destroy their infrastructure
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000]  and the answer is that no man
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000]  no evil person
[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000]  would simply conjure up
[01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000]  that kind of
[01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000]  scenario
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000]  and on his own
[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000]  the only way a human being
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000]  looking out for his best interest would do that
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000]  if someone more powerful than him
[01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000]  had said you do what I say
[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000]  and I grant you immunity
[01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000]  you will come out unscathed
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000]  now he won't be able to fulfill those promises
[01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000]  but that's the only thing
[01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000]  it gets smart
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000]  evil people to go along with an agenda
[01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000]  that does threaten their existence
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000]  they've been promised immunity
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000]  they've been promised that they'll escape
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000]  by people in our government
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000]  even retired CIA
[01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000]  DEA, FBI
[01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000]  they built major bunker
[01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000]  safe-room systems in homes in Colorado
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000]  Utah and other safe places
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000]  I mean these people are not dumb
[01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000]  they know what's coming
[01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000]  and they are preparing to defend themselves
[01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000]  the government of course
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000]  and its continuity government program has
[01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000]  the huge new underground bunkers
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000]  major system in the west Utah desert
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000]  to replace Cheyenne Mountain
[01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000]  target they've been doing a lot
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000]  of secret bunker systems because they know
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000]  the Soviets and the Chinese know where the original
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000]  ones were and they want protection
[01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000]  but as I say
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000]  ultimately
[01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000]  Christ is going to have the last say
[01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000]  his second coming I believe
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000]  comes because Satan has
[01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000]  near total control over the entire world
[01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000]  except for a remnant of good people
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000]  which won't be allowed to be destroyed
[01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000]  I mean we've got a real battle royal
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000]  on our hands Alex and
[01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000]  you know you're doing a great job
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000]  in terms of alerting people to what's coming
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000]  but the big thing is
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000]  people need to know
[01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000]  it's not necessarily economic collapse
[01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000]  it's the major problem it is
[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000]  this war with Russia and China
[01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000]  and they are both building for it
[01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000]  that we are disarming
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000]  proposing in the next few months
[01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000]  another disarmament treaty with Russia
[01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000]  even though they have been violating every single one
[01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000]  can you imagine the irony of that
[01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000]  is that we have three nuclear powers
[01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000]  major nuclear powers
[01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000]  and we're negotiating with one
[01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000]  disarming is if the third China doesn't
[01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000]  make any difference
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000]  I mean talk about a fool's paradise
[01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000]  you know that's not the same disarmament
[01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000]  when you aren't even
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000]  suggesting a disarmament treaty
[01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000]  with the third which is going to
[01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000]  slowly outstrip even Russia
[01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000]  in terms of ability to
[01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000]  put nuclear throwing
[01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000]  stay there I want to cover the waterfront

[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000]  with President Obama

[01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000]  to completely destroy the Republican Party
[01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000]  so there's no opposition
[01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000]  the open borders

[01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000]  the high mountains of southern Mexico
[01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000]  where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique
[01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000]  grown arabica beans

[01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000]  sodium fluoride and other toxic members
[01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000]  of the fluoride family are devastating
[01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000]  the health and cognitive ability of the American people
[01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000]  so why are the social engineers
[01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000]  adding it to the water
[01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000]  simple dumb down the host population
[01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000]  that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on
[01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000]  we may not have been able
[01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000]  to get fluoride out of the water supply yet
[01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000]  but we can help to get it out of our bodies

[01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000]  let's take a stand against the globalist

[01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000]  at Joel Scousen
[01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000]  of world affairs brief
[01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000]  to get his take on him
[01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000]  first off
[01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000]  how are things going for Obama
[01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000]  in your view
[01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000]  they're trying to put autocratic elected presidents
[01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000]  but also appointed Goldman Sachs
[01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000]  dictators over places like Italy
[01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000]  and Greece
[01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000]  Obama is
[01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000]  openly taking on
[01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000]  dictatorial powers more and more
[01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000]  republican leaderships not even really criticizing it
[01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000]  or they are mildly
[01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000]  obviously that's part of a longer precedent
[01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000]  to concentrate power
[01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000]  but Obamacare was
[01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000]  designed as we know to implode healthcare
[01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000]  but it's extremely unpopular
[01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000]  but they don't seem to care
[01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000]  they just go forward with every program
[01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000]  even if it's unpopular
[01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000]  but they're trying to catch up
[01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000]  what's going on domestically
[01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000]  with the economy
[01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000]  how are things going for the globalist
[01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000]  Joel Scousen then I'm going to ask you
[01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000]  what do you think is most important that's going on right now
[01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000]  well first of all
[01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000]  the state of the union
[01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000]  addressed by Obama was very telling
[01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000]  the biggest thing that he announced
[01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000]  really was a minimum wage increase
[01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000]  to ten ten
[01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000]  ten dollars and ten cents
[01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000]  and everything else was downplayed
[01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000]  very telling Alex because it means
[01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000]  instead of broadcasting
[01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000]  what is agenda is going to be
[01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000]  in the next year
[01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000]  he was downplaying
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000]  oh he mentioned amnesty
[01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000]  and we need to pass it
[01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000]  he mentioned disarmament
[01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000]  he mentioned some of these other things
[01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000]  but were he to come out and make a major presentation
[01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000]  we're going to have this
[01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000]  presenting this amnesty bill
[01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000]  and I'm presenting this major stuff
[01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000]  there is a crescendo
[01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000]  of the wave of opposition to Obama
[01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000]  and I feel that the downplaying
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000]  of these issues in the state of the union
[01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000]  was specifically meant
[01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000]  not to raise up
[01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000]  the opposition
[01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000]  not to get everything stirred up
[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000]  they want to slip these in
[01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000]  either through executive orders
[01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000]  or through
[01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000]  their compromised republicans like John Boehner
[01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000]  getting him to go and he's preparing to go along
[01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000]  with amnesty
[01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000]  so that's how I view the Obama administration
[01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000]  where he's under fire
[01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000]  he's very unpopular
[01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000]  and that's why as I mentioned
[01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000]  in today's World Affairs Brief
[01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000]  he threw a bone to
[01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000]  Marco Rubio, Senator Rubio
[01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000]  it's very rare that a democratic president
[01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000]  would say something positive
[01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000]  about a republic and it's going to run
[01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000]  against Hillary Clinton in the next election
[01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000]  but he did
[01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000]  and that can only mean
[01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000]  number one
[01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000]  that the typical corrupt politician
[01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000]  that they wanted to throw at conservatives
[01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000]  he was just like Rudolph Giuliani in 2008
[01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000]  wasn't going to fly with conservatives
[01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000]  neither is Chris Christie
[01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000]  and so he threw a bone
[01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000]  through a major cadu to
[01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000]  Senator Rubio and that means
[01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000]  he's the backup man the establishment
[01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000]  is going to promote probably for president
[01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000]  there's several others in the
[01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000]  offering but that was the telling
[01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000]  incident and it shows
[01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000]  the establishment is probably
[01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000]  going to allow the republicans to have
[01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000]  a controlled president they get certain things
[01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000]  done under a radical
[01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000]  democrat like Obama
[01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000]  and they get certain things done
[01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000]  under a person that controlled republican
[01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000]  like George W. Bush and they'll have
[01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000]  I guarantee you a very controlled republican
[01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000]  in 2016
[01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000]  for us
[01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000]  now in terms of the economy
[01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000]  the economy is still
[01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000]  struggling a lot of figures are down
[01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000]  only a few figures
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000]  are up and a lot of those are manipulated
[01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000]  but there is
[01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000]  a comeback coming in
[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000]  the housing market
[01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000]  mostly because demand is so high
[01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000]  rentals are hot
[01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000]  they're running out of rentals
[01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000]  all of the millions of people that are coming online
[01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000]  getting married and joining the workforce
[01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000]  have no place to live
[01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000]  they're pushing the rental market
[01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000]  there is going to be a continued
[01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000]  rise in the housing market it won't be
[01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000]  a major bubble in my opinion
[01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000]  but it looks like
[01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000]  it's the best to inflate
[01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000]  in a moderate way
[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000]  in order to keep this thing going
[01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000]  one of the things I want to say though
[01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000]  about the economy
[01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000]  is that
[01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000]  this recession that we're still in
[01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000]  they're calling it a recovery but we're still in a recession
[01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000]  this really is what's real Alex
[01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000]  this is where people ought to get used
[01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000]  to the level of business
[01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000]  Walmart's got to get used to
[01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000]  lower sales because that reflects
[01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000]  what people are still selling enough to make a profit
[01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000]  of this thing but they are
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000]  having to get used to lower sales
[01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000]  and so rather than call it
[01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000]  a depression or
[01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000]  a recovery
[01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000]  what it really is is a stagnant
[01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000]  economy that is sorting out over time
[01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000]  the longer you
[01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000]  allow it to go over time without collapsing
[01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000]  the more it
[01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000]  tends to sort it out
[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000]  and I am of the strong
[01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000]  belief
[01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000]  that in contrast
[01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000]  to what William keeps saying
[01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000]  that his insiders I think is bogus
[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000]  that
[01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000]  they are not trying to collapse the economy
[01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000]  if they wanted to collapse the economy
[01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000]  all they have to do is pull the money supply
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000]  and it would happen overnight
[01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000]  all the Ponzi schemes
[01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000]  the paper gold contracts
[01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000]  the naked shorts
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000]  the derivatives hit
[01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000]  all that would collapse
[01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000]  but they aren't pulling the plug on
[01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000]  what they're doing is they're pumping up
[01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000]  all of their economy systems
[01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000]  they don't control
[01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000]  they're consolidating things right now
[01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000]  well it is true
[01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000]  that most of the new money that is created
[01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000]  first of all goes through the speculative economy
[01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000]  it goes through the major
[01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000]  banks that control the Federal Reserve
[01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000]  the J.P. Morgan Chase
[01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000]  Goldman Sachs gets into the stock market
[01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000]  and that's why the stock market is due for
[01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000]  major correction
[01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000]  correction
[01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000]  I think it could come down in this year
[01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000]  it's 20%
[01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000]  but that won't collapse the economy
[01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000]  economies really don't collapse
[01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000]  unless war comes along
[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000]  they do go down
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000]  there are depressions but all of those things are caused
[01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000]  by pulling the money supply
[01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000]  just like the depression in 1929-30
[01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000]  and they're not showing any signs
[01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000]  right now pulling the money supply
[01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000]  they're showing all the signs that continue
[01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000]  to bail things out
[01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000]  now I'm not predicting that things are good
[01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000]  they aren't good
[01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000]  if you see every sign that the powers that be
[01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000]  don't want to pull the money
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000]  they want a long cold depression
[01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000]  against everybody
[01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000]  but the sectors and combines
[01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000]  they control
[01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000]  let's expand out from that point
[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000]  what do you make of the reports by the head of
[01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000]  Saudi intelligence four months ago
[01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000]  that he would launch Al-Qaeda attacks inside Russia
[01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000]  we now see those unfolding
[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000]  do those look like those are real terror attacks
[01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000]  meaning to destabilize the Olympics
[01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000]  for Russia helping Syria
[01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000]  is there a motive there
[01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000]  or does Putin have any type of motive
[01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000]  for a false flag
[01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000]  well
[01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000]  it's complex
[01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000]  and hard to answer Alex because
[01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000]  there's a lot that we can't prove
[01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000]  there have been reports of
[01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000]  the Saudis threatening Putin
[01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000]  I personally don't believe it
[01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000]  I don't believe Saudi Arabia would ever get
[01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000]  in the position of threatening Russia
[01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000]  who could squash them like a bug
[01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000]  if they wanted to
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000]  there is legitimate
[01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000]  as I pointed out in a couple of world affairs
[01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000]  briefs back
[01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000]  the U.S. and Russia have both used
[01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000]  false flag terrorism
[01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000]  to gin up the war against
[01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000]  terror so that they can use that to clamp down
[01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000]  on opposition
[01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000]  but in doing so both the U.S.
[01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000]  and Russia have created real terror
[01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000]  in response to their occupation
[01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000]  in response to their
[01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000]  using
[01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000]  false flag terror to justify clamping down
[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000]  on people's
[01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000]  they have produced real terror
[01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000]  and so in my estimation
[01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000]  there is real terror that happened in
[01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000]  Bolodov, Grodd
[01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000]  which is about 100 kilometers
[01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000]  from Sochi
[01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000]  I'll tell you the reports I've got from
[01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000]  Sochi is that the KGB
[01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000]  and the Secret Service of Russia
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000]  is out in force they've got anti-nissle
[01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000]  batteries on the camouflage nets
[01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000]  they have got
[01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000]  hundreds and hundreds
[01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000]  of forces roaming the streets and playing
[01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000]  clothes
[01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000]  it could still happen but boy I'll tell you
[01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000]  Putin knows that the real
[01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000]  terrorists want to embarrass him
[01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000]  and he's determined not to be embarrassed
[01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000]  but I'm frankly not
[01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000]  buying the
[01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000]  rumor or the propaganda that the Saudis
[01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000]  are trying to
[01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000]  take out or take on
[01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000]  Russia directly. Well regardless we know
[01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000]  that the globalist have been funding radical
[01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000]  Islam in that area and so why
[01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000]  is radical Islamists
[01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000]  activating ahead of the Olympics
[01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000]  do you think the West is behind that?
[01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000]  Well
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000]  not really you kind of remember that the West
[01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000]  is
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000]  really supporting Russia
[01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000]  and has been for many years
[01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000]  they do antagonize Russia
[01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000]  to give Russia the excuse
[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000]  to go before their people and say
[01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000]  the US is meddling in our elections
[01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000]  and other things and the US could do that
[01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000]  provertly in a very smart way
[01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000]  kind of an obtuse way
[01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000]  so that they can get caught so that
[01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000]  Putin can have the excuse to go before
[01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000]  the people built anti-American sentiment
[01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000]  and that's what he's doing.
[01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000]  And vice versa what about Ukraine
[01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000]  I mean is that because they wouldn't join the EU
[01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000]  and this is a big issue Alex
[01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000]  the Ukraine is going to be
[01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000]  an ongoing thing now
[01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000]  Gorbachev came out and
[01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000]  asked Putin to intervene militarily
[01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000]  in Ukraine it suggested you so
[01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000]  Putin visited Ukraine
[01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000]  said no military intervention
[01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000]  but he did want to set down the guidelines
[01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000]  here's what I think happening
[01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000]  just like Hitler used
[01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000]  attacks on Germans in the
[01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000]  Sudetenland and Poland to justify
[01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000]  an eventual invasion
[01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000]  Russia has put millions of Russians
[01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000]  emigres
[01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000]  into Ukraine
[01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000]  into Georgia
[01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000]  into Belarus
[01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000]  into the Baltic states and they're still there today
[01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000]  as a minority
[01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000]  it's easy to get those people to
[01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000]  you know
[01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000]  have an attack mentality or get a
[01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000]  false flag attack on them to justify
[01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000]  Russian troop intervention
[01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000]  it's too early for that however
[01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000]  and I don't think
[01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000]  that Russia wants to move too soon
[01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000]  they're not ready to take on the United States
[01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000]  in a major third world war
[01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000]  that's why I don't think they're going to
[01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000]  end up supporting Syria
[01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000]  or Iran if they go down
[01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000]  just like they let Iraq go down
[01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000]  there are major new weapons systems
[01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000]  that both Russia and China are putting
[01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000]  online are not supposed
[01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000]  to come online or be in
[01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000]  operational until
[01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000]  at least 2020 so this is
[01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000]  clearly too early
[01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000]  to be
[01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000]  creating a false flag
[01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000]  excuse to go in militarily
[01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000]  into Ukraine that's it
[01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000]  it's my analysis
[01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000]  that this is going to be a festering thing
[01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000]  that's going to go on for several years
[01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000]  and will build into a crescendo
[01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000]  that will spread into
[01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000]  Georgia and Belarus
[01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000]  and other countries that will eventually justify
[01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000]  a Russian intervention
[01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000]  in the same sense over in
[01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000]  the Far East China is
[01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000]  really getting some hot rhetoric
[01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000]  at the Davos
[01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000]  International Economic Conference
[01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000]  they really went head to head
[01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000]  with Japanese Prime Minister Abe
[01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000]  and you know threats
[01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000]  and counter threats and the trouble is
[01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000]  that eastern
[01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000]  mentality is one of saving face
[01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000]  and they get up there and pound the pulp
[01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000]  to make threats to one another
[01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000]  and it's very difficult for Orientals to back down
[01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000]  and save face especially the Chinese
[01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000]  nevertheless
[01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000]  they too aren't ready to take on
[01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000]  the world we are going to see them continue
[01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000]  to test the waters
[01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000]  but do you agree that at any time with China saying
[01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000]  they might invade and take Philippine islands
[01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000]  they might take Japanese to speeded islands
[01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000]  I mean if that happens if Japan
[01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000]  doesn't stand down
[01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000]  it will be a confrontation or is China
[01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000]  really that willing to saber-rattle
[01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000]  because as you said the whole Asian
[01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000]  cultural, historical, military
[01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000]  mindset they don't usually threaten
[01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000]  something unless they are planning to carry it out right?
[01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000]  That's right
[01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000]  and as I say they don't want to lose face
[01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000]  and I think
[01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000]  they are going to test the waters
[01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000]  by taking control militarily of some of these islands
[01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000]  and I think the US
[01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000]  is going to let them get away with it
[01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000]  and I think that's going to be a big time
[01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000]  to China yep we are on a roll
[01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000]  just like we did with the Japanese
[01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000]  in the 30's
[01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000]  exactly we let them get away
[01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000]  we let them invade China we didn't stop them
[01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000]  and it only gave them more
[01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000]  enthusiasm for the fight
[01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000]  and so I think that's what you are going to see
[01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000]  I think you are going to see them take
[01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000]  the Philippine islands first
[01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000]  or they might take the ones down by
[01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000]  Vietnam
[01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000]  which are disputed as well
[01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000]  they probably need the Senkakos to last
[01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000]  because Japan does have a fairly
[01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000]  formidable defense
[01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000]  force that could put up a fight
[01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000]  but I think you are going to see a little
[01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000]  domino effect going on here and you are going to see
[01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000]  the US show it's
[01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000]  a conciliatory paper tiger
[01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000]  nature and we know what they are up to
[01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000]  the globalists like
[01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000]  Admiral Locklear
[01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000]  in charge of the Sink Compact
[01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000]  is
[01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000]  clearly out to pacify
[01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000]  the Chinese
[01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000]  they know it the Obama administration put him
[01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000]  in that position to pacify
[01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000]  and it's going to create war
[01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000]  these people are playing
[01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000]  soft in order to
[01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000]  invite this attack
[01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000]  China and Russia know that the west
[01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000]  is a formidable enemy
[01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000]  and that's why they are aching for more
[01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000]  disarmament and they want more
[01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000]  time so we are going to see these
[01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000]  things play out over time
[01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000]  but I still think it's too early
[01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000]  their weapons systems are not online
[01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000]  they are rushing things though
[01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000]  they talk about this four new aircraft carrier
[01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000]  groups that are trying to
[01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000]  put it in
[01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000]  they are actually in construction
[01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000]  the keels are being laid
[01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000]  they are not supposed to according to
[01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000]  report six months ago be ready
[01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000]  an operational to 2020
[01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000]  to 24
[01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000]  and the latest report coming out the Chinese
[01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000]  said they want them operational by 2020
[01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000]  that indicates that
[01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000]  they are accelerating their
[01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000]  timeline or attempting to
[01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000]  and as I pointed out in my world affairs brief
[01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000]  last week the closer they
[01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000]  get to operational readiness for war
[01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000]  with the west
[01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000]  the easier it is for them to go early
[01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000]  by taking
[01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000]  advantage of an opportunity that may present
[01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000]  itself
[01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000]  sure that could happen any time then and expanding on this
[01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000]  the Chinese
[01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000]  more than the Russians
[01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000]  are sending up satellite killers
[01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000]  a lot of the satellites that are going down
[01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000]  it looks like there's some covert stuff going on
[01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000]  undoubtedly the west is probably
[01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000]  sabotaging satellites and other
[01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000]  space-based platforms there's a whole bunch of stuff
[01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000]  up there that's at least 30 years in advance
[01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000]  of what we know Bob Bowman and others confirm
[01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000]  that so that's another issue
[01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000]  if this war kicks off
[01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000]  what will it look like if it starts
[01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000]  in a regional deal Domino's
[01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000]  gets out of control like World War One
[01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000]  or other events we're going to see
[01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000]  some space war aren't we
[01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000]  we are but only after
[01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000]  I think we absorb a nuclear first strike
[01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000]  here's how I think it's going to come down Alex
[01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000]  the trigger event
[01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000]  has to be North Korea
[01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000]  North Korea is the most
[01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000]  rogue element in the world
[01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000]  and yet it's being given a pass
[01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000]  by the US we don't do anything to stop its
[01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000]  nuclear progress unlike Iran
[01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000]  and Iran is being set up
[01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000]  by the way for a failure of this current agreement
[01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000]  so that the US can
[01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000]  attack that was put out
[01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000]  in the Brookings Institution piece
[01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000]  in 2009
[01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000]  where they said you know what the US needs to do
[01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000]  is bend them back
[01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000]  to give them a peace deal
[01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000]  haven't violated so that it appears as if
[01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000]  we didn't want this war but Iran really
[01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000]  slapped us in the face over this
[01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000]  I think that's what Iran speaks
[01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000]  that will not turn into
[01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000]  World War Three because
[01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000]  Russia and China it's too early
[01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000]  they aren't ready to go to World War
[01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000]  over Iran
[01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000]  to consolidate Israel's hegemony
[01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000]  over the Middle East
[01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000]  and the hatred of both the US and Israel
[01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000]  will increase dramatically
[01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000]  which feeds the excuse that
[01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000]  Russia and China need eventually to take down
[01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000]  the bully of the world but the trigger event
[01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000]  I believe will be North Korea
[01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000]  when you see a North Korean launched
[01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000]  against the South they have
[01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000]  they do some minor
[01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000]  military attack every year so you've got to
[01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000]  be careful not to
[01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000]  confuse those with the major
[01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000]  barragement soul if that ever starts
[01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000]  you know your days away from
[01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000]  nuclear war people ought to get out of the
[01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000]  cities that are made to nuclear
[01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000]  targets like Seattle
[01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000]  Washington DC
[01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000]  when we come back tell us how the war games
[01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000]  it's not just your analysis this is what a lot of the big
[01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000]  think tanks admit that's why the main force
[01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000]  is to Asia how it will play out within
[01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000]  two days how big the nuclear
[01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000]  attack will be and of course the film
[01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000]  strategic relocation that we produce together
[01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000]  I should add is available exclusively

[01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000]  it's too many GMO foods and toxins

[01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:33.000]  it's really bombshell
[01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000]  to target constitutional peace
[01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000]  officers and things like that
[01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000]  we know how this takeover is going to look
[01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000]  and the government could do a false flag
[01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000]  to go after liberty movement
[01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000]  at any time or they could wait
[01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000]  the point is that we know this is being geared up
[01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000]  but we shouldn't even be afraid of it
[01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000]  we should be afraid of not speaking out against it
[01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000]  we should be afraid of not speaking
[01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000]  and exposing it
[01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000]  I get frustrated people ask why I get mad at football
[01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.000]  well they just obsess over the family
[01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:01.000]  of one quarterback
[01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000]  and the other quarterbacks family
[01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000]  and what they eat for dinner
[01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000]  and what they're into
[01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.000]  it's all the military mind of man
[01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000]  being projected onto something that doesn't matter
[01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.000]  like we're studying thermal nuclear war
[01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000]  we're studying geopolitics
[01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000]  we're studying the stock market
[01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000]  we're studying the mindset of the elite
[01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000]  we're studying
[01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.000]  people think that's weird
[01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000]  like studying real things even though in the real world
[01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.000]  you can make a lot of money
[01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.000]  just in business knowing this stuff
[01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000]  this is how the elite think
[01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000]  except it's from their perspective
[01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.000]  and then we try to spend time
[01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000]  learning how the real world works and it's weird
[01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.000]  that's why I get very upset
[01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000]  about the things of a child
[01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000]  it'd be one thing if you went to a ball game
[01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000]  because your kid's in it or you like to sports team
[01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000]  but when it becomes God
[01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000]  that's what makes me sick
[01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.000]  we've got four minutes left Joel Scousen
[01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.000]  thank you so much for the time
[01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.000]  you've got the floor break down
[01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.000]  why you say Korea is the trigger
[01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000]  most other big analysts agree with that by the way
[01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000]  you know if it ever kicks off with China
[01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000]  how that would unfold
[01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000]  and why we've pivoted to the
[01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000]  Pacific and where that's going
[01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.000]  well
[01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000]  in the first place the pivot to the Pacific
[01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000]  is really only about a 10% increase in
[01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000]  acid it's not enough to deter China
[01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000]  it's a little bit of political
[01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000]  theater
[01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000]  there has to be a reason why
[01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.000]  North Korea has been preserved
[01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000]  that's why I say it's got to be the trigger
[01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000]  in other words Iran
[01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:29.000]  they've fumed, they've threatened
[01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000]  the military options on the table
[01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000]  they want regime change, we infiltrate
[01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000]  we use covert operations
[01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000]  we do none of that with North Korea
[01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000]  in fact we've guaranteed them
[01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000]  no regime change and no military options
[01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000]  on the table why they're the most
[01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.000]  powerful regime in the world
[01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:47.000]  and yet we do nothing
[01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.000]  and that's only because
[01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.000]  it could only be because the globalists know
[01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:53.000]  that they are the puppet
[01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000]  of China and that they will be the trigger
[01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.000]  here's how I think it's going down
[01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.000]  I think there will be an attack against
[01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.000]  South Korea
[01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.000]  the North Koreans have over 2 million troops
[01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.000]  20,000 artillery troops
[01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.000]  they can level Seoul in a matter of 3 or 4 days
[01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:09.000]  the only way the US
[01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000]  can stop that attack
[01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000]  from taking over the South is using tactical
[01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000]  nuclear weapons
[01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000]  and that would give China the excuse
[01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000]  then to nuke the United States
[01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000]  the US is the guilty of first use
[01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000]  the US is the bully of the world
[01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000]  Russia and Chinese unite
[01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000]  to launch against US military targets
[01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.000]  not civilian targets per se
[01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000]  there will be about 12 to 15 cities
[01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.000]  that are inextricably connected
[01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.000]  with the military that we're going to get hit
[01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000]  like I've mentioned in strategic relocation
[01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:39.000]  you don't want to be in those cities
[01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.000]  when that comes
[01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.000]  you may have 2 days notice
[01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.000]  when that attack in Korea starts
[01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.000]  before China launches on the United States
[01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000]  and if you ever see everything black out
[01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.000]  because both Russia and China will use
[01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:53.000]  a preemptive nuclear
[01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.000]  or EMP strike
[01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:57.000]  electromagnetic pulse strike to take down the grid
[01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.000]  before the nukes actually fall
[01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000]  the only time you see all electricity
[01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:03.000]  out
[01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:05.000]  and no news, nothing at all
[01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000]  that's the time you need to be getting out of those cities
[01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.000]  before the panic hits
[01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.000]  now I think our globalists
[01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.000]  come out of their bunkers then
[01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.000]  they'll survive the attack
[01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.000]  they'll say the Russians and Chinese
[01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000]  see this, we need to establish
[01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.000]  a global military
[01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.000]  because our military has been taken down
[01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000]  no one to protect us, we need a global military force
[01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.000]  and that's when the big world war 3 starts
[01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.000]  that's right, that's when it starts
[01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.000]  only then Alex
[01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.000]  does the US bring out the space base weapons
[01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.000]  to stop Russia and China
[01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000]  from getting any more targets
[01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:39.000]  I want to do 5 more on this than David Knight's coming in
[01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.000]  this is GCN
[01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.000]  the Genesis Communications Radio Network
[01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.000]  the globalist social engineers are not just
[01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:55.000]  targeting us with propaganda
[01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:57.000]  they are manipulating our genetics
[01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.000]  we are being targeted at every level
[01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:01.000]  by estrogen mimicers
[01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:03.000]  that lower our testosterone and other
[01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:05.000]  natural compounds that the body needs
[01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.000]  after consulting top doctors, nutritionists

[02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:45.000]  I'm sorry, I heard you say something in my ear
[02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.000]  okay, well we're getting the club of Obama
[02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:49.000]  saying he'll act alone
[02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:51.000]  but he's been saying that a lot
[02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:53.000]  in the State of the Union yesterday
[02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:55.000]  but later after Estelin leaves
[02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:57.000]  I want to talk about Vladimir Putin
[02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:59.000]  because I really thought about Vladimir Putin
[02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.000]  a lot last night
[02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:03.000]  and the geopolitical things that are happening
[02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:05.000]  and when you've gone through the depths of evil
[02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000]  like the Russians have for 80 years
[02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:09.000]  I don't romanticize the strongman Putin
[02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:11.000]  but there is a
[02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:13.000]  psychological thing that happens sometimes
[02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:15.000]  when someone's actually in control
[02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:17.000]  and is in command to a great extent
[02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:19.000]  where people actually want to build up society
[02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:21.000]  you can get what you call a philosopher king
[02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:23.000]  and the globalists actually endorse that idea
[02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:25.000]  but they never really manifest it
[02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:27.000]  I wouldn't say
[02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:29.000]  he is a philosopher king
[02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.000]  but compared to Obama
[02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:35.000]  he is
[02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:37.000]  Vladimir Putin is a philosopher king compared to Obama
[02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:39.000]  because he's saying
[02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:41.000]  men need to be strong, women need to be women and strong
[02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:43.000]  family, don't try to recruit kids
[02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:45.000]  you want to destabilize us
[02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:47.000]  with psychological warfare
[02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:49.000]  I mean that's what it is
[02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:51.000]  they don't want to make kids gay
[02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:53.000]  because they love gay people
[02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.000]  they want to absolutely rewrite
[02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:57.000]  if you're trying to teach you'll fish to be gay
[02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:59.000]  well they wouldn't reproduce, there'd be no more fish
[02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.000]  it's extinct yourself
[02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:03.000]  it has nothing to do with hating someone's
[02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:05.000]  sexual situation
[02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:07.000]  it's the force feeding of it
[02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:11.000]  and Putin
[02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:13.000]  I remember reading this and seeing this
[02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:15.000]  was a big fan of Alexander Shiltson Eatson
[02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.000]  who wrote the Gulag Archipelago
[02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:19.000]  and talked about a strong Russia
[02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:21.000]  nationalism going back to freedom
[02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.000]  being honorable, being stoic
[02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.000]  and really kind of welding
[02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:27.000]  a 1776 type idea
[02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:29.000]  into the old Russian
[02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:31.000]  stoic
[02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.000]  Viking because that's what Russia is
[02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:35.000]  means the roost, the red
[02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:37.000]  really founded by the Vikings in western Russia
[02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:39.000]  and merged with some Asian groups
[02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.000]  that's what they are
[02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.000]  it's kind of an Asiatic Viking group
[02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000]  an Asian Viking splice
[02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.000]  and
[02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:49.000]  that's why Russians are so smart
[02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.000]  but they also have their problems
[02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:53.000]  they were under Zara systems for so long
[02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:55.000]  that they never had a chance at freedom
[02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:57.000]  and then our criminal government
[02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:59.000]  with the big banks on record
[02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:01.000]  put the Bolsheviks in in 1917
[02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.000]  I mean we owe Russia such an apology
[02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:05.000]  they've been our ally all along against the British
[02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:07.000]  they did so much for this country
[02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:09.000]  even before you name it
[02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:11.000]  and then we just absolutely let the globalists
[02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:13.000]  put in the worst of the worst
[02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:15.000]  and just butcher those people
[02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:17.000]  up one side and down the other
[02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.000]  and they used Russia as a giant engine of evil
[02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:21.000]  against Ukraine, Poland, Romania
[02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:23.000]  what's the Czech Republic now
[02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:25.000]  and then created an incredible enmity
[02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:27.000]  between Slavs and Slavs
[02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:29.000]  just total evil
[02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:31.000]  and now the West is attacking them with Al-Qaeda
[02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:33.000]  and you look at Putin
[02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:35.000]  he clearly, that's people resonating with it
[02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:37.000]  he is confident because he
[02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:39.000]  met a lot with Sholzhenitsyn
[02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:41.000]  and Sholzhenitsyn literally grabbed Putin
[02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:43.000]  and said you will not sell people out
[02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:45.000]  you'll stop being a gangster
[02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:47.000]  this is reportedly a decade ago
[02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:49.000]  this only leaked out through some of my connections
[02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:51.000]  and sources, I went and checked it
[02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:53.000]  and it's been hinted at here and there and confirmed
[02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:55.000]  that Sholzhenitsyn basically
[02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:57.000]  and he met with him right before he died too
[02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:59.000]  said stop being a sellout
[02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:01.000]  be a knight for Russia
[02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:03.000]  stand up, be real
[02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:05.000]  and that's why he came here in the 80s
[02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:07.000]  and Sholzhenitsyn left
[02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:09.000]  very honorable Stoic man because
[02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:11.000]  he came and saw the decadence
[02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:13.000]  and the evil and he was like
[02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:15.000]  it's growing here and it's not even like the Soviets did this to us
[02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:17.000]  they would just like a judo move
[02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.000]  take all of our own evil
[02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:21.000]  that was already there
[02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:23.000]  and then a punch comes they would take it
[02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:25.000]  and pull it along with them
[02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:27.000]  and that's why it's so easy to be evil
[02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:29.000]  because if you just want to wreck people
[02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:31.000]  and use their ignorance against them
[02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:33.000]  of course you can dominate them
[02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:35.000]  but who wants to dominate a destroyed person
[02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:37.000]  you only dominate someone
[02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:39.000]  who is coming down on you
[02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:41.000]  and has attacked you first
[02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:43.000]  and then all bets are off
[02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.000]  you got to do whatever it takes to defeat them
[02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:47.000]  and that's what we need
[02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:49.000]  is real warriors of liberty
[02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:51.000]  and I'm not saying Putin is perfect
[02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:53.000]  but he has
[02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:55.000]  gone through a process
[02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:57.000]  that compared to Obama
[02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:59.000]  is very good
[02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:01.000]  my friends Alex Jones here
[02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:03.000]  to tell you about some of the most important information
[02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:05.000]  concerning you and your family's health
[02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:07.000]  radiation levels have more than doubled
[02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:09.000]  in the last 60 years in the northern hemisphere
[02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:11.000]  from all of the nuclear testing
[02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:13.000]  and radiological accidents
[02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:15.000]  radioactive contamination is now
[02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:17.000]  in most of the food supply
[02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:19.000]  there's only two ways to avoid this
[02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:21.000]  move south of the equator
[02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:23.000]  or properly protect your thyroid
[02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:25.000]  with nascent iodine
[02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:27.000]  looking to protect my family I've done deep research
[02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:29.000]  nascent iodine is the purest
[02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:31.000]  cleanest absolute best form

[02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:03.000]  and he went on to say he used dictatorial powers
[02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:05.000]  to go after the Second Amendment
[02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:07.000]  and more
[02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:09.000]  so what a speech, Daniel Estolin joins us
[02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:11.000]  he is a best selling
[02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:13.000]  author and a Bilderberg sleuth
[02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:15.000]  and I consider him a friend of mine
[02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:17.000]  and he's written an excellent new book
[02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:19.000]  we're not selling it but we should be
[02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:21.000]  selling it at the info wars store
[02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:23.000]  trans evolution the coming age of human destruction
[02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:25.000]  Daniel Estolin
[02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:27.000]  from the author of the true story
[02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:29.000]  of the Bilderberg group
[02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:31.000]  and it's available from trine day
[02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:33.000]  and is he able to stay with us till 40 after
[02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:35.000]  I forgot to ask you guys that
[02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:37.000]  or is he got to go at the bottom of the hour
[02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:39.000]  because I wanted to get that question into him earlier
[02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:41.000]  last hour, just ask him now before we go to him
[02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:43.000]  okay great
[02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:45.000]  now the whole point here
[02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:47.000]  is that everything he's talked about
[02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:49.000]  and the late Jim Tucker talked about
[02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:51.000]  and I've talked about and Ron Paul's talked about
[02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:53.000]  where Putin's talking about it's bizarre folks
[02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:55.000]  that they've put top people over
[02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:57.000]  Russian state run TV
[02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:59.000]  that basically talk about cancer viruses
[02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:01.000]  and vaccines, the plan to destroy the family
[02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:03.000]  the new world order
[02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:05.000]  and the Russians are going with a
[02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:07.000]  truthful way to try to unify
[02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:09.000]  their country from outside attack and overthrow
[02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:11.000]  and I don't like
[02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:13.000]  the fact that Putin's been cracking down on the press
[02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:15.000]  and people but those are foreign
[02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:17.000]  proven
[02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:19.000]  Soros run groups
[02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:21.000]  it's a serious situation, what do you do
[02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:23.000]  when you are being infiltrated by foreign powers
[02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:25.000]  that's what the new world order is
[02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:27.000]  it's a corporate above the law
[02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:29.000]  breakaway civilization that wants to build its own
[02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:31.000]  global technocracy
[02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:33.000]  and Daniel Estolin, I happen to know
[02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:35.000]  via some other connections
[02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:37.000]  and Tucker before he died and then some other folks
[02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:39.000]  then I brought it up to Estolin one time
[02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:41.000]  over the phone, he said well yeah
[02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:43.000]  that is one of my sources that I mean
[02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:45.000]  he really does have these big sources
[02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:47.000]  high level Hollywood, high level banking
[02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:49.000]  high level
[02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:51.000]  Builderberg and so
[02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:53.000]  that's why he's basically saying the same thing I say
[02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:55.000]  because it's not like we're reading from the same sheet
[02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:57.000]  of music, it's not
[02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:59.000]  music we're looking at, it's a death warrant
[02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:01.000]  on humanity, we're looking from different perspectives
[02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:03.000]  at the same program
[02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:05.000]  being rolled down and his
[02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:07.000]  book, I just began to read it
[02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:09.000]  this weekend, I'm almost done
[02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:11.000]  I even learned something
[02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:13.000]  reading and which
[02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:15.000]  I mean I know a lot
[02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:17.000]  and just the way he puts things
[02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:19.000]  really gets people to think
[02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:21.000]  and it's got a good cover to get the average folks
[02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:23.000]  thinking out there and the reason I'm pitching it
[02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:25.000]  even though I'm not selling it is, it is really
[02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:27.000]  really important
[02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:29.000]  for people
[02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:31.000]  to understand
[02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:33.000]  the real
[02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:35.000]  mindset of who runs the planet
[02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:37.000]  and so I want to get into his book first
[02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:39.000]  but then the bottom of the hour I want him to give
[02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:41.000]  us his take on what's happening geopolitically
[02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:43.000]  the race from
[02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:45.000]  Spain to
[02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:47.000]  where he's at, from Greece to
[02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:49.000]  Japan
[02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:51.000]  to everywhere, towards dictatorship
[02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:53.000]  and towards Goldman Sachs
[02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:55.000]  people being appointed as presidents, I mean this is
[02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:57.000]  this is corporate world government
[02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:59.000]  what he thinks about Soros
[02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:01.000]  trying to overthrow Ukraine because they
[02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:03.000]  wouldn't join the EU
[02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:05.000]  just simply amazing
[02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:07.000]  the time and history we're
[02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:09.000]  entering and the fact that we've been so
[02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:11.000]  right, I wish we weren't right
[02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:13.000]  Daniel do you wake up a lot of times in the middle of the night
[02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:15.000]  like I do and just wish
[02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:17.000]  that we'd been wrong, I mean it's not very
[02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:19.000]  satisfying to be so dead on is it
[02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:21.000]  No it's not
[02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:23.000]  First of all Alex it's great to be back on your show
[02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:25.000]  I certainly do consider you to be
[02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:27.000]  a very very good friend of mine, very proud
[02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:29.000]  of all the things that you've done together
[02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:31.000]  over the years standing shoulder to shoulder
[02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:33.000]  way back in the 2006
[02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:35.000]  Build Up a Conference if you remember
[02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:37.000]  and a few other events as well so I'm very
[02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:39.000]  very very honored to be back on your show
[02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:41.000]  you know it's as you said
[02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:43.000]  you know from Greece to Spain to
[02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:45.000]  the United States, Ukraine
[02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:47.000]  Russia we've seen this
[02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:49.000]  before it's deja vu
[02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:51.000]  over and over and over again
[02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:53.000]  be it Soros in the Ukraine
[02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:55.000]  or be it Soros in the Soviet
[02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:57.000]  Union or post-Soviet Union Russia
[02:12:57.000 --> 02:12:59.000]  as they try to destroy
[02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:01.000]  Russia in the 1990s
[02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:03.000]  trying to turn it into
[02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:07.000]  it lost its statehood
[02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:09.000]  it became a protectorate
[02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:11.000]  and you have the Human Rights Watch in there
[02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:13.000]  you have the George Soros and the
[02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:15.000]  Harvard Endowment and the Carnegie's
[02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:17.000]  and Goldman Sachs and the same players
[02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:19.000]  over and over again in all these same locations
[02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:21.000]  always doing the same thing
[02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:23.000]  and as some of my sources have said when I asked them
[02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:25.000]  I said why do you guys always do the same thing
[02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:27.000]  over and over again they said to me
[02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:29.000]  because it works why would we change
[02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:31.000]  that's right
[02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:33.000]  that's why they run the same attack profile
[02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:35.000]  but I think that is their weakness
[02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:37.000]  that if we get the public to realize that
[02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:39.000]  it's game over and I think
[02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:41.000]  their old tricks are starting to fail
[02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:43.000]  you know you have a very
[02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:45.000]  good point there Alex I listen to
[02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:47.000]  a show not every night but certainly
[02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:49.000]  a lot of the times because you know your morning
[02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:51.000]  is our afternoon it's 7 o'clock
[02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:53.000]  7.15 in the afternoon here p.m.
[02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:55.000]  but you know
[02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:57.000]  back in 2005
[02:13:57.000 --> 02:13:59.000]  when Jim Tucker, God bless his soul and I
[02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:01.000]  were the only two journalists who covered
[02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:03.000]  the Rotterheger and Bilderberg conference
[02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:05.000]  and at that conference
[02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:07.000]  I learned something which basically
[02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:09.000]  is the backbone to this new book
[02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:11.000]  the transhumanism of the coming age
[02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:13.000]  of human deconstruction
[02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:15.000]  it was based on the
[02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:17.000]  discussion at that meeting
[02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:19.000]  which later turned into the strategic
[02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:21.000]  trends report
[02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:23.000]  2007-2036
[02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:25.000]  which at the time was a secret source
[02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:27.000]  document on the future of humanity
[02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:29.000]  I got a hold of that in 2005
[02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:31.000]  I was looking through it and I said to myself
[02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:33.000]  this isn't the future
[02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:35.000]  this is the present
[02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:37.000]  and the present that they were talking about back in 2005
[02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:39.000]  which turned in 2007
[02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:41.000]  into a report which is now
[02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:43.000]  available you can download it for free
[02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:45.000]  on the internet is the backbone
[02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:47.000]  of what we're seeing right now
[02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:49.000]  you know the age of transition
[02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:51.000]  transition to a global civilization
[02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:53.000]  and this is exactly
[02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:55.000]  what we're seeing right now it's how the terms
[02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:57.000]  from back then that I remember
[02:14:57.000 --> 02:14:59.000]  reading in the report they were talking about
[02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:01.000]  flash mobs
[02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:03.000]  what was a flash mob I said to myself in 2005
[02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:05.000]  I don't understand what it means
[02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:07.000]  what we do now
[02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:09.000]  you look at Turkey, you look at Kiev
[02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:11.000]  one day everything is fine
[02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:13.000]  the next day the city is being burned down
[02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:15.000]  by people we don't know where they came from
[02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:17.000]  that's a flash mob
[02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:19.000]  it wasn't the report which is the backbone
[02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:21.000]  to my book transhumanism
[02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:23.000]  amazing and
[02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:25.000]  just put it all in scope and then we'll drill down into details
[02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:27.000]  what is the master plan
[02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:29.000]  if you say had 4 minutes till break
[02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:31.000]  4 minutes to talk to 3 million people
[02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:33.000]  and encapsulate if they succeed
[02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:35.000]  what will be left
[02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:37.000]  and what the time scales are
[02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:39.000]  you know it's interesting because you know the basic
[02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:41.000]  the basic theory is this
[02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:43.000]  if you think of a pyramidal structure
[02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:45.000]  like 6,000 years ago
[02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:47.000]  who controlled knowledge, high priests
[02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:49.000]  and they fed it to us one little droplet at a time
[02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:51.000]  we the great and worst then
[02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:53.000]  or now basically were fed
[02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:55.000]  this information just enough
[02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:57.000]  so we can do our daily chores
[02:15:57.000 --> 02:15:59.000]  and live day to day
[02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:01.000]  well today
[02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:03.000]  this pyramid is upside down pyramid
[02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:05.000]  because of the internet revolution
[02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:07.000]  anybody anywhere in the world
[02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:09.000]  the UI somebody in Japan
[02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:11.000]  or a Koya Indian sitting in a tree
[02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:13.000]  in the middle of an Amazon forest
[02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:15.000]  with a computer
[02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:17.000]  and access to internet
[02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:19.000]  has access at his fingertips
[02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:21.000]  to the entire history of knowledge
[02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:23.000]  of mankind so if you are the elite
[02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:25.000]  that's bad news for them
[02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:27.000]  because suddenly the playing field
[02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:29.000]  because of these technological advancements
[02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:31.000]  has been even on the one hand
[02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:33.000]  but on the other hand the elites said to themselves
[02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:35.000]  we gotta do something
[02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:37.000]  and they're using the technology and the advancement
[02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:39.000]  to create a bigger and bigger
[02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:41.000]  and bigger gap which we thought
[02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:43.000]  were you know was actually being bridged
[02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:45.000]  so you know if you spent
[02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:47.000]  trillions of quadrillions
[02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:49.000]  or gazillions of dollars in trying to
[02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:51.000]  you know use the technology
[02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:53.000]  to get so far ahead of what we are right now
[02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:55.000]  you can actually do this because
[02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:57.000]  they have the money and you know
[02:16:57.000 --> 02:16:59.000]  one of the things I'm talking about in this book
[02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:01.000]  and it is I think absolutely revolutionary
[02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:03.000]  is that our children, your children
[02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:05.000]  my children, my oldest daughter is 16
[02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:07.000]  they're the last
[02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:09.000]  truly human generation of human beings
[02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:11.000]  on the planet her children
[02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:13.000]  and you know her children's children
[02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:15.000]  are gonna be trans humans
[02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:17.000]  post humans, men machine
[02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:19.000]  cyborgs beings
[02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:21.000]  who are not totally human
[02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:23.000]  humans who are not 100% beings
[02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:25.000]  we are literally living
[02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:27.000]  at the cost of the greatest change
[02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:29.000]  in the history of mankind
[02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:31.000]  and it has nothing to do
[02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:33.000]  with a microchip in your hand
[02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:35.000]  it is technology that is so advanced
[02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:37.000]  that people literally will be able to
[02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:39.000]  in less than a generation
[02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:41.000]  download their consciousness
[02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:43.000]  onto a computer
[02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:45.000]  and live forever and that's what a trans humanist
[02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:47.000]  movement is all about
[02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:49.000]  a book is called trans evolution
[02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:51.000]  the coming age of human
[02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:53.000]  deconstruction
[02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:55.000]  and they're
[02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:57.000]  saying they're not gonna give us free will
[02:17:57.000 --> 02:17:59.000]  they're just going to do it
[02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:01.000]  and it's so much more advanced than a chip
[02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:03.000]  we carry a little computer that watches everything we do
[02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:05.000]  and tracks everything we do
[02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:07.000]  better than a super computer of 20 years
[02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:09.000]  ago now they have the quantum computers
[02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:11.000]  and the key here Daniel
[02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:13.000]  is the prediction of the future
[02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:15.000]  where Amazon can now ship you your order
[02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:17.000]  it with 100% accuracy
[02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:19.000]  this was always the key
[02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:21.000]  the literal crystal ball
[02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:23.000]  where they get enough data on the world
[02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:25.000]  and how things work they can predict the future
[02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:27.000]  and then with that data they can manipulate the future
[02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:29.000]  we're literally seeing
[02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:31.000]  godlike power being given to this degenerate
[02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:33.000]  elite
[02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:35.000]  it's very interesting Alex
[02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:37.000]  in the last 50 years we've learned more
[02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:39.000]  than the entire history of mankind
[02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:41.000]  and in the next 20 we will have learned
[02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:43.000]  more than the last 50
[02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:45.000]  in the history of mankind
[02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:47.000]  and it's gonna get to a point in about a generation and a half
[02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:49.000]  from now where we'll be doubling
[02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:51.000]  our knowledge every year
[02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:53.000]  and that's something unfathomable for people
[02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:55.000]  because we don't even know what the future
[02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:57.000]  is gonna look like and that's one of the things about this
[02:18:57.000 --> 02:18:59.000]  book you know with Buildable I answered
[02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:01.000]  a lot of the questions but with this book
[02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:03.000]  when you finish it you have more questions
[02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:05.000]  than answers because it's the future
[02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:07.000]  and we really don't know even if we try to extrapolate it
[02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:09.000]  there's just so many unknowns
[02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:11.000]  but we certainly see
[02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:13.000]  where all of it is going
[02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:15.000]  that's right and the elite may be good at watching us
[02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:17.000]  manipulating us but look at them
[02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:19.000]  themselves trying to dumb us down
[02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:21.000]  and control us that shows they're not enlightened
[02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:23.000]  right there and
[02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:25.000]  with this power I don't know
[02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:27.000]  if we're gonna make it out of this Daniel
[02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:29.000]  well they need to
[02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:31.000]  dumb us down you know the basement
[02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:33.000]  of education is part of it because people
[02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:35.000]  who are aware of what's going on
[02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:37.000]  people who understand history, who understand
[02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:39.000]  geography, who can add
[02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:41.000]  and subtract, who are interested
[02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:43.000]  and keen and who realize
[02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:45.000]  that what separates us from animals
[02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:47.000]  is this divine spark of reason
[02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:49.000]  that we have which allows us
[02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:51.000]  you know to invent, to investigate
[02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:53.000]  to discover new things
[02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:55.000]  to be empowered individuals
[02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:57.000]  with a spark of creativity
[02:19:57.000 --> 02:19:59.000]  to where we might have our own destiny
[02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:01.000]  instead of being their robot slaves

[02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:41.000]  it's about total human control
[02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:43.000]  the NSA all of it
[02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:45.000]  and like children, the public are taught to deny
[02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:47.000]  that this stuff's even going on
[02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:49.000]  but daniel ustalin
[02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:51.000]  is an expert on this, he has the sources
[02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:53.000]  so much of this is now out in the open
[02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:55.000]  a big hope is within the establishment
[02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:57.000]  itself they may need to
[02:24:57.000 --> 02:24:59.000]  basically get religion to understand
[02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:01.000]  this program will destroy them
[02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:03.000]  but they say they're willing to do that
[02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:05.000]  if it allows them to have immortality
[02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:07.000]  they believe they'll have immortality
[02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:09.000]  merging with her
[02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:11.000]  to use that example
[02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:13.000]  with a popular film out there
[02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:15.000]  a very powerful dystopic film
[02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:17.000]  I'm going to do a review of soon
[02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:19.000]  and that's what we're facing here
[02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:21.000]  this is the end of humanity
[02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:23.000]  you can see this technology is dumbing us down
[02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:25.000]  it's not empowering us overall
[02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:27.000]  because it's being deployed
[02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:29.000]  in a dehumanizing way
[02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:31.000]  daniel ustalin, this is the most powerful interview ever with you
[02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:33.000]  you're really getting fiery here
[02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:35.000]  talking about to be or not to be
[02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:37.000]  that is the question, that spark of humanity
[02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:39.000]  well I choose to be
[02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:41.000]  be a human
[02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:43.000]  I've seen all the disasters these people engage in
[02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:45.000]  and what I'm saying is
[02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:47.000]  they've got a big plan, they are visionaries
[02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:49.000]  they're in control, they steal our wealth
[02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:51.000]  but I'm saying I don't like their dream
[02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:53.000]  and I don't think their dream will succeed
[02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:55.000]  but regardless
[02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:57.000]  we need to educate the public
[02:25:57.000 --> 02:25:59.000]  about their nightmare they're trying to create
[02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:01.000]  daniel ustalin
[02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:03.000]  absolutely alex, god bless you
[02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:05.000]  what is absolutely true
[02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:07.000]  is that the rise of the machine is here
[02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:09.000]  and we're facing the time of the
[02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:11.000]  unconscious evolution period
[02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:13.000]  is almost finished
[02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:15.000]  and we come to this new period when
[02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:17.000]  a controlled human evolution can and will happen
[02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:19.000]  and they believe that it will happen
[02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:21.000]  technological progress
[02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:23.000]  will be concentrated on making a new body
[02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:25.000]  for the human being
[02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:27.000]  the plan is to incrementally
[02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:29.000]  move the human mind into more
[02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:31.000]  disembodied and futuristic vehicles
[02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:33.000]  not bodies but vehicles
[02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:35.000]  first a humanoid robot
[02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:37.000]  controlled entirely by the human brain
[02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:39.000]  via brain machine interface
[02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:41.000]  then a conscious human brain
[02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:43.000]  transplanted into a humanoid robot
[02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:45.000]  then consciousness uploaded
[02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:47.000]  to a computer and finally a hologram
[02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:49.000]  that contains a full
[02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:51.000]  conscious human mind
[02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:53.000]  DARPA is finding dozens
[02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:55.000]  of human augmentation projects around the world
[02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:57.000]  to radically improve the performance
[02:26:57.000 --> 02:26:59.000]  mental capacity and resilience
[02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:01.000]  first in soldiers obviously
[02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:03.000]  and then later on in humans
[02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:05.000]  everything from tapping the potential
[02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:07.000]  of our unconscious mind
[02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:09.000]  to augmented cognition
[02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:11.000]  and the creation of an uninhibited
[02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:13.000]  combat vehicles or by the military
[02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:15.000]  expects in the very near future
[02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:17.000]  for individual pilots to fly
[02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:19.000]  entire squadrons of robot planes
[02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:21.000]  they're working on
[02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:23.000]  this mind-boggling experience such as
[02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:25.000]  cybernetic insects
[02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:27.000]  and we see this in films like GI Joe
[02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:29.000]  it's already there
[02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:31.000]  it is a total genetic rewrite
[02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:33.000]  of the planet overthrowing
[02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:35.000]  the creation
[02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:37.000]  and then you look at the byproduct
[02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:39.000]  the fruits of all their programs
[02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:41.000]  it's dehumanizing, it's not even empowering
[02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:43.000]  and they're not being honest
[02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:45.000]  with the public, all the white papers you're mentioning
[02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:47.000]  that your book's based on
[02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:49.000]  it's out there, it's on record
[02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:51.000]  but people need to understand
[02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:53.000]  this is the end of humanity
[02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:55.000]  and they are aggressively
[02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:57.000]  right now trying to destroy the family
[02:27:57.000 --> 02:27:59.000]  Vladimir Putin speaks out against that
[02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:01.000]  and he's a bad person
[02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:03.000]  you know because of the synergy Alex
[02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:05.000]  the interplay of three great revolutions
[02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:07.000]  the quantum, the computer and biotech revolutions
[02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:09.000]  again we have learned so much
[02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:11.000]  in such a short period of time
[02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:13.000]  the marvels of science like the internet
[02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:15.000]  telecommunications satellites
[02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:17.000]  laser beams, radio, television
[02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:19.000]  microwave, structures of DNA molecules
[02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:21.000]  biotechnology
[02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:23.000]  all of it ultimately comes from quantum theory
[02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:25.000]  and they dominate this
[02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:27.000]  you know we have the means through genetics
[02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:29.000]  robotics
[02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:31.000]  information technology and nanotech
[02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:33.000]  to control matter and energy
[02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:35.000]  and life itself, we have never seen anything like this before
[02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:37.000]  and it is raising
[02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:39.000]  profound questions about what it means
[02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:41.000]  to be human and some of these questions
[02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:43.000]  you know we're seeing
[02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:45.000]  by public officials
[02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:47.000]  Putin is talking about this which is one of the reasons I'm mentioning this
[02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:49.000]  it is being completely ignored
[02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:51.000]  in the United States
[02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:53.000]  but this intense cross-pollination
[02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:55.000]  between the computer, biotech
[02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:57.000]  and quantum revolutions will give us unprecedented
[02:28:57.000 --> 02:28:59.000]  power in the 21st century
[02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:01.000]  and this is something that as you said
[02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:03.000]  people simply
[02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:05.000]  are unaware of
[02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:07.000]  that's right and I want to talk to you in the next long segment
[02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:09.000]  this is intriguing Daniel
[02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:11.000]  about your ideas
[02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:13.000]  to try to turn this around
[02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:15.000]  because I believe that we can have a revolution
[02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:17.000]  to your book and other systems
[02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:19.000]  of understanding about this
[02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:21.000]  and have humans know that they've got to actively be part of this
[02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:23.000]  decision making process
[02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:25.000]  it could actually empower humanity
[02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:27.000]  with the nanotech, the rest of it
[02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:29.000]  and we could literally be launching space fleets
[02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:31.000]  in just a few decades to colonize space
[02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:33.000]  in a way to empower humanity
[02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:35.000]  while maintaining our humanity
[02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:37.000]  but also if we choose
[02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:39.000]  then having a separate
[02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:41.000]  almost avatar
[02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:43.000]  that we test these systems with
[02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:45.000]  and I believe that is the program that should be followed
[02:29:45.000 --> 02:30:07.000]  but I want to talk about this on the other side with you
[02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:17.000]  we have now managed to secure
[02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:19.000]  the sought after beans

[02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:39.000]  hands down this is my favorite coffee
[02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:41.000]  and it's taken us years to secure connections

[02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:03.000]  in the last 50 years
[02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:05.000]  iodine has been phased out of our staple foods
[02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:07.000]  and replaced with the halogen
[02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:09.000]  bromine a practice
[02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:11.000]  now banned in nations around the world
[02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:13.000]  guess what else is in the halogen family?

[02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:23.000]  salt producers to add iodine
[02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:25.000]  it's the good halogen
[02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:27.000]  on the periodic table and the results

[02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:27.000]  the globalists have emergency seed and
[02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:29.000]  arc banks because they know they're rewriting the entire
[02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:31.000]  genetic code of the planet
[02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:33.000]  in case things go wrong
[02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:35.000]  they have a backup what about a backup for humanity
[02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:39.000]  undoubtedly
[02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:41.000]  the eugenicists
[02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:43.000]  that develop biometrics in
[02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:45.000]  1860s and
[02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:47.000]  envisioned the genetic code
[02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:49.000]  and the double helix that has been the ancient sign
[02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:51.000]  of medicine for 6000 years
[02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:53.000]  the ancients do a lot more folks
[02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:55.000]  than the modern historians
[02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:57.000]  will tell you and that's all part
[02:33:57.000 --> 02:33:59.000]  of the secret societies
[02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:01.000]  that's all part of the illuminate
[02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:03.000]  the priest class
[02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:05.000]  that Daniel Eslund was so eloquently
[02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:07.000]  investigative journalist bestselling author
[02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:09.000]  sold tens of millions of copies of his
[02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:11.000]  non-fiction books in Europe
[02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:13.000]  he's also written novels that are basically
[02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:15.000]  like pochinic real but
[02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:17.000]  the names are changed to protect the innocent
[02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:19.000]  and
[02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:21.000]  a lot of important information
[02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:23.000]  at his website as well
[02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:25.000]  and I will give you
[02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:27.000]  the address it's dandleslund.com
[02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:29.000]  I know his site but he's got several
[02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:31.000]  others up there but that's
[02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:33.000]  the main one it's an excellent site
[02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:35.000]  but I want to talk to him
[02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:37.000]  about free will because that's what he's getting
[02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:39.000]  in here this is freedom versus slavery
[02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:41.000]  I'm not against humans developing
[02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:43.000]  and advancing the problem
[02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:45.000]  is the spirit that animates
[02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:47.000]  the ghost that animates
[02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:49.000]  the globalist machine is very
[02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:51.000]  anti-human very predatory
[02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:53.000]  hey let the troops use DU let them die
[02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:55.000]  hey let the navy drive through the radiation
[02:34:55.000 --> 02:34:57.000]  and let the troops be in wheelchairs
[02:34:57.000 --> 02:34:59.000]  and catheterize and dying so what
[02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:01.000]  but then have football games how much
[02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:03.000]  we love the troops the globalist hate
[02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:05.000]  pure good
[02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:07.000]  loving people they hate
[02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:09.000]  altruistic
[02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:11.000]  knights more and more I realize
[02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:13.000]  that they are threatened by good people
[02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:15.000]  because they've cheated
[02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:17.000]  to get into control and they
[02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:19.000]  can't help their psychopathic and sociopathic
[02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:21.000]  and other you know
[02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:23.000]  criminology designations
[02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:25.000]  and it is
[02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:27.000]  a predatory group that's infested civilization
[02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:29.000]  since its beginnings so I want to
[02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:31.000]  ask Daniel Estolin
[02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:33.000]  we need to put out because obviously
[02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:35.000]  no one's going to stop this march forward
[02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:37.000]  and the church is so controlled they just say
[02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:39.000]  oh the world's going to end next week don't worry about it
[02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:41.000]  but obviously that's not what's going on here there's a great challenge
[02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:43.000]  coming we need to be the salt of the
[02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:45.000]  earth and I'm asking you what you think we should do
[02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:47.000]  to say hey
[02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:49.000]  there is advanced breakaway civilization
[02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:51.000]  30 40 years ahead the globalists say
[02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:53.000]  a how advanced
[02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:55.000]  are they in the breakaway civilization
[02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:57.000]  in the corporate government reservations and b
[02:35:57.000 --> 02:35:59.000]  what is an alternate vision
[02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:01.000]  where we can try to capture
[02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:03.000]  the imagination of the public about what's really happening
[02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:05.000]  so they're not obsessed with Justin Bieber
[02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:07.000]  and they're obsessed more
[02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:09.000]  with giant space colony missions
[02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:11.000]  to the nearest star systems and habitable planets
[02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:13.000]  and the real trailblazer
[02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:15.000]  master builder
[02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:17.000]  spirit of humanity
[02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:19.000]  it's a very good questions Alex
[02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:21.000]  very very good questions you can summarize it
[02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:23.000]  I think the following way
[02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:25.000]  you know you have to understand that
[02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:27.000]  the people who are
[02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:29.000]  our enemy
[02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:31.000]  are not the rocker fellows of Rothschild
[02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:33.000]  so just the names
[02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:35.000]  but it's
[02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:37.000]  it's a different movement
[02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:39.000]  one of the things I talk about in the book is this transhumanist
[02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:41.000]  movement we're taking
[02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:43.000]  as this vector for the future
[02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:45.000]  mega projects such as Russia 2045
[02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:47.000]  movement
[02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:49.000]  which they intend to create this new civilization
[02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:51.000]  aimed at future human development
[02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:53.000]  and evolution by integrating
[02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:55.000]  these new discoveries and developments
[02:36:55.000 --> 02:36:57.000]  from science, from physics, you know
[02:36:57.000 --> 02:36:59.000]  energetics, aeronautics, bioengineering, nanotechnology
[02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:01.000]  neurology, cybernetics
[02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:03.000]  cognitive science and on and so forth
[02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:05.000]  and the rocker fellows of this world
[02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:07.000]  really have nothing to do
[02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:09.000]  or to say in this matter
[02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:11.000]  because they will have been dead by then
[02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:13.000]  but the point is that the transhumanists
[02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:15.000]  and I think the face of transhumanism
[02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:17.000]  is Ray Kurzweil
[02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:19.000]  one of the greatest inventors of the 20th century
[02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:21.000]  unfortunately a lot of the things
[02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:23.000]  that are being done by him right now
[02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:25.000]  are very little to do with helping humanity
[02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:27.000]  he was one of the
[02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:29.000]  kind of Google development
[02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:31.000]  he thinks he's going to become God
[02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:33.000]  that's right, exactly, Ray Kurzweil
[02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:35.000]  now the whole idea behind this transhumanist movement
[02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:37.000]  if you want to know what it is
[02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:39.000]  it's as simple as H plus
[02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:41.000]  human plus transhuman
[02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:43.000]  is this ultra-high-tech dream
[02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:45.000]  of computer scientists, philosophers
[02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:47.000]  neuroscientists and many others
[02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:49.000]  to use radical advances in technology
[02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:51.000]  to augment the human body
[02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:53.000]  human mind and ultimately
[02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:55.000]  the entire human experience
[02:37:55.000 --> 02:37:57.000]  and these people wish to become post-human
[02:37:57.000 --> 02:37:59.000]  which is someone who has been modified
[02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:01.000]  and with performance enhancing
[02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:03.000]  body, not drugs
[02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:05.000]  body and brain augmentations
[02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:07.000]  to the point that they could no longer
[02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:09.000]  call themselves human
[02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:11.000]  but again, the Rockefellers have nothing to do with it
[02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:13.000]  and they describe us like bugs
[02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:15.000]  that okay, you don't have to get augmented
[02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:17.000]  but you'll be like a bug, we might step on you
[02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:19.000]  and my issue is
[02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:21.000]  that Google and the rest of them
[02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:23.000]  are at the head of this
[02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:25.000]  the systems
[02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:27.000]  are all being designed to control
[02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:29.000]  they claim on the surface
[02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:31.000]  it's a system to empower
[02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:33.000]  but I don't see that at the heart of it
[02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:35.000]  absolutely right, you got it, you're absolutely right
[02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:37.000]  you're one of the few people who said it exactly how it is
[02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:39.000]  look, neurochip interfaces
[02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:41.000]  computer chips that connect directly to the brain
[02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:43.000]  are being developed right now
[02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:45.000]  and the ultimate goal of the brain chip
[02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:47.000]  will be to increase intelligence
[02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:49.000]  thousands of times over
[02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:51.000]  basically turning the human brain into the supercomputer
[02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:53.000]  lifelong emotional well-being
[02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:55.000]  is also a key concept
[02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:57.000]  for the transhumanist movement
[02:38:57.000 --> 02:38:59.000]  and they can achieve this through a
[02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:01.000]  recalibration of the pleasure
[02:39:01.000 --> 02:39:03.000]  concentrates in the brain
[02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:05.000]  pharmaceutical mood renders
[02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:07.000]  have been suggested
[02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:09.000]  exactly which will be cleaner
[02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:11.000]  and safer than the mind-altering drugs
[02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:13.000]  this is Hoxley's
[02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:15.000]  21st century vision
[02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:17.000]  of scientific dictatorship
[02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:19.000]  without tears but behind all of this
[02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:21.000]  no matter how you look at it
[02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:23.000]  this technology
[02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:25.000]  is
[02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:27.000]  something that we've talked about a lot before
[02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:29.000]  it's a transhumanist
[02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:31.000]  movement and the post humanity
[02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:33.000]  will be a new human
[02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:35.000]  which has been genetically engineered
[02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:37.000]  and brain chip for total control
[02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:39.000]  part man and part machine
[02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:41.000]  this new man will no longer have a need
[02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:43.000]  of the sexual reproductive function
[02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:45.000]  that's right and this plan
[02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:47.000]  is to reduce the world's population
[02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:49.000]  you know I can't think of a better way to do that
[02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:51.000]  and not only that but was
[02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:53.000]  through synthetic biology
[02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:55.000]  the change in our DNA
[02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:57.000]  through genetically modified crop
[02:39:57.000 --> 02:39:59.000]  they can literally create beings
[02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:01.000]  who are not human that have never existed
[02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:03.000]  on the planet earth
[02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:05.000]  so why do they need men and women
[02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:07.000]  as a couple they don't need that anymore
[02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:09.000]  which is why as you said on your website yesterday
[02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:11.000]  I think it was
[02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:13.000]  talking about the Illuminati agenda
[02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:15.000]  at the last Grammy Awards
[02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:17.000]  although this is exactly why they're pushing it
[02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:19.000]  and this is one of the reasons why they hate people like Putin
[02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:21.000]  who is absolutely against this kind of an agenda
[02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:23.000]  that's right
[02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:25.000]  and here's the key I want to ask you this point
[02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:27.000]  they're toxifying the environment on purpose
[02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:29.000]  then the crisis comes
[02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:31.000]  they use that to bring an agenda 21
[02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:33.000]  and neofutilism to shut people down
[02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:35.000]  for social control so we can then follow
[02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:37.000]  their scientific dictatorial
[02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:39.000]  edicts always posing as the savior
[02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:41.000]  and clearly destroying
[02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:43.000]  reproductive fertility
[02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:45.000]  clearly wrecking humanity
[02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:47.000]  where it's going to be impossible to live
[02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:49.000]  in the civilization
[02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:51.000]  unless you accept
[02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:53.000]  the transhumanism
[02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:55.000]  it is simply, simply amazing
[02:40:55.000 --> 02:40:57.000]  this is beyond
[02:40:57.000 --> 02:40:59.000]  a HP Lovecraft book
[02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:01.000]  it's beyond a brand
[02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:03.000]  Dracula
[02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:05.000]  this is, this is literally
[02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:07.000]  something out of the mind of the devil
[02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:09.000]  Alex, you know these technologies
[02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:11.000]  and again you talked about this
[02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:13.000]  are not being developed to stop the terrorists
[02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:15.000]  but rather to stop us
[02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:17.000]  the people and the laws
[02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:19.000]  to justify these technologies
[02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:21.000]  they're not written on a whim
[02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:23.000]  they're specifically designed to give the government
[02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:25.000]  carte blanche authority
[02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:27.000]  over the people during the chaos
[02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:29.000]  and confusion of the period we're in right now
[02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:31.000]  which the elite
[02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:33.000]  called the age of transition
[02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:35.000]  transition to planetary
[02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:37.000]  civilization
[02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:39.000]  and I think people have to realize
[02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:41.000]  that the bin lans and the kadafis are not the enemy
[02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:43.000]  they never were the enemy
[02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:45.000]  we the people of the enemy
[02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:47.000]  that's right we are allowing ourselves to be seduced
[02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:49.000]  by this as we cover
[02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:51.000]  in my film in game blueprint for global enslavement
[02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:53.000]  that you're in and when that came out eight years ago
[02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:55.000]  it was a big hit because people thought it was science fiction
[02:41:55.000 --> 02:41:57.000]  now they're watching it
[02:41:57.000 --> 02:41:59.000]  the film's more popular than it's ever been
[02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:01.000]  because now it almost
[02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:03.000]  all came true eight years later
[02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:05.000]  you know I used to buy
[02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:07.000]  boxes of your film Alex
[02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:09.000]  you know and you know go on trips
[02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:11.000]  because I traveled a lot last year I did 240,000 kilometers
[02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:13.000]  about 200,000 miles
[02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:15.000]  of traveling around the world
[02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:17.000]  and I used to give you a CD
[02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:19.000]  of your films away to people and they're saying
[02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:21.000]  who is this Alex Jones character
[02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:23.000]  which I said watch the film and you'll realize
[02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:25.000]  and again please understand
[02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:27.000]  those who are watching and listening to us right now
[02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:29.000]  these are not publicly
[02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:31.000]  funded projects for the betterment of humanity
[02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:33.000]  but they're mostly
[02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:35.000]  secret experiments sanctioned
[02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:37.000]  in the name of defense
[02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:39.000]  which when you put it on its head
[02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:41.000]  is crime prevention and extrapolate
[02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:43.000]  into the future is tailor made
[02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:45.000]  to pull down any rebellion
[02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:47.000]  by the 99%
[02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:49.000]  of the world's population destined
[02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:51.000]  to live in abject poverty
[02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:53.000]  and crime infested mega cities
[02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:55.000]  of the future just as the
[02:42:55.000 --> 02:42:57.000]  strategic trends report talks
[02:42:57.000 --> 02:42:59.000]  about which I read way way way back
[02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:01.000]  in 2005 almost 10 years
[02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:03.000]  ago and so much if not all
[02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:05.000]  of it is you know coming through
[02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:07.000]  that's what's incredible
[02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:09.000]  and people need to understand
[02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:11.000]  they go well I don't care if the NSA watches me
[02:43:11.000 --> 02:43:13.000]  or whatever because I've done nothing wrong
[02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:15.000]  well why don't you live in a glass house then
[02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:17.000]  why don't you
[02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:19.000]  dress up like an agent you know in black
[02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:21.000]  a man in black
[02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:23.000]  and then go look in people's windows in broad daylight
[02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:25.000]  and see them call the police on me and I'm gonna say
[02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:27.000]  well what's wrong the government does it
[02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:29.000]  just to illustrate with a camera crew
[02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:31.000]  or to go up people on the street and say do you mind if
[02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:33.000]  you were clean a clear
[02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:35.000]  raincoats just to make sure you're not carrying
[02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:37.000]  a weapon and they'll go well of course I'm not gonna do that
[02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:39.000]  and go away New York's already trying to make
[02:43:39.000 --> 02:43:41.000]  people only have clear bags
[02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:43.000]  you know the point is we're being trained
[02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:45.000]  to be slaves not even to be enslaved
[02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:47.000]  but to stand down
[02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:49.000]  so we can be erased
[02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:51.000]  Daniel let me ask you this question
[02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:53.000]  do you think they're gonna
[02:43:53.000 --> 02:43:55.000]  succeed what does your gut tell you and what
[02:43:55.000 --> 02:43:57.000]  is the time frame because
[02:43:57.000 --> 02:43:59.000]  I don't know the time frame is
[02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:01.000]  because again one of the things about this book
[02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:03.000]  and it's a bit unnerving in the sense that
[02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:05.000]  it asks more questions than it answers
[02:44:05.000 --> 02:44:07.000]  because again we're talking about the future
[02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:09.000]  but I think you know what it's
[02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:11.000]  absolutely undeniable is this
[02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:13.000]  divine spark of reason which makes
[02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:15.000]  us so different from anything else on this planet
[02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:17.000]  can never be replicated
[02:44:17.000 --> 02:44:19.000]  no matter whether your name is Ray Kurzweil
[02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:21.000]  you know Jason Silva
[02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:23.000]  or any one of these other characters
[02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:25.000]  billionaires and zillionaires
[02:44:25.000 --> 02:44:27.000]  who want to literally turn us into something
[02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:29.000]  we're not, men machine
[02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:31.000]  future post humans
[02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:33.000]  beings who are not fully human
[02:44:33.000 --> 02:44:35.000]  they will never be able to ever
[02:44:35.000 --> 02:44:37.000]  be able to replicate exactly he says
[02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:39.000]  from a
[02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:41.000]  storage thing full of his dad's papers
[02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:43.000]  he's gonna resurrect his father
[02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:45.000]  there is no way Ray Kurzweil's gonna
[02:44:45.000 --> 02:44:47.000]  resurrect his real father
[02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:49.000]  he may have a computer that can fool him
[02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:51.000]  and he thinks it's his father
[02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:53.000]  and he says he doesn't believe in God yet
[02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:55.000]  he's gonna be the first God
[02:44:55.000 --> 02:44:57.000]  I call it the God race
[02:44:57.000 --> 02:44:59.000]  the race to be God
[02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:01.000]  and it's as old as
[02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:03.000]  the Garden of Eden
[02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:05.000]  it's as old as the Tower of Babel
[02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:07.000]  and if we tried to build a new future
[02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:09.000]  out of love and compassion and transparency
[02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:11.000]  we might destroy ourselves
[02:45:11.000 --> 02:45:13.000]  but from this delusional perspective
[02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:15.000]  my concern is is these people
[02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:17.000]  are
[02:45:17.000 --> 02:45:19.000]  they want to control us but who controls them
[02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:21.000]  closing comments and thank you so much
[02:45:21.000 --> 02:45:23.000]  for the time I'm gonna read the whole book
[02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:25.000]  I want to get with your publisher and carry it as well
[02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:27.000]  in the info or store
[02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:29.000]  just another amazing job Daniel Estolin
[02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:31.000]  what do you want to leave us with in two minutes
[02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:33.000]  you know I just want to go over some
[02:45:33.000 --> 02:45:35.000]  of the things that this report the strategic trends
[02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:37.000]  2007-2036
[02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:39.000]  talked about they're talking about
[02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:41.000]  by 2015 over
[02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:43.000]  50% of the world's population
[02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:45.000]  will be living in urban rather than rural environments
[02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:47.000]  in one generation between
[02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:49.000]  2007 and 36
[02:45:49.000 --> 02:45:51.000]  the population will go from 7 to 10
[02:45:51.000 --> 02:45:53.000]  billion people they're talking
[02:45:53.000 --> 02:45:55.000]  in this report about lack of food
[02:45:55.000 --> 02:45:57.000]  water medicine proper hygiene
[02:45:57.000 --> 02:45:59.000]  education and basic human necessities
[02:45:59.000 --> 02:46:01.000]  will spell collapse
[02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:03.000]  and without missing words
[02:46:03.000 --> 02:46:05.000]  the report states explicitly
[02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:07.000]  a growing gap between majority
[02:46:07.000 --> 02:46:09.000]  and a small number of highly
[02:46:09.000 --> 02:46:11.000]  visible super rich
[02:46:11.000 --> 02:46:13.000]  is likely to cause an increasing
[02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:15.000]  threat to social order
[02:46:15.000 --> 02:46:17.000]  and stability the result of the growing
[02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:19.000]  desperation on the part
[02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:21.000]  of humanity will result in civil war
[02:46:21.000 --> 02:46:23.000]  intra-communal violence
[02:46:23.000 --> 02:46:25.000]  insurgency pervasive criminality
[02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:27.000]  and widespread disorder this is from
[02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:29.000]  2005
[02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:31.000]  then they talk about that the
[02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:33.000]  countries the nation states
[02:46:33.000 --> 02:46:35.000]  because of the collapse
[02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:37.000]  of the global economy
[02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:39.000]  and a breakdown of the international
[02:46:39.000 --> 02:46:41.000]  political system these are all
[02:46:41.000 --> 02:46:43.000]  terms from the report will
[02:46:43.000 --> 02:46:45.000]  disappear and will be replaced
[02:46:45.000 --> 02:46:47.000]  by mega cities
[02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:49.000]  and a mega city is defined in the report
[02:46:49.000 --> 02:46:51.000]  as a city of a base population
[02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:53.000]  minimum 20 million people
[02:46:53.000 --> 02:46:55.000]  and then they say
[02:46:55.000 --> 02:46:57.000]  because of the massive population
[02:46:57.000 --> 02:46:59.000]  displacement cities will swell to
[02:46:59.000 --> 02:47:01.000]  unimaginable proportions
[02:47:01.000 --> 02:47:03.000]  as a result of that mega cities
[02:47:03.000 --> 02:47:05.000]  themselves will collapse
[02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:07.000]  by the year 2045
[02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:09.000]  and the effect of this collapse
[02:47:09.000 --> 02:47:11.000]  will be equivalent to state failure
[02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:13.000]  and to endemic failure of the entire
[02:47:13.000 --> 02:47:15.000]  and of course that's the British Ministry
[02:47:15.000 --> 02:47:17.000]  of Defense report that you had already
[02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:19.000]  gotten a copy of in 2005 that came out
[02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:21.000]  what in the Guardian in 2007
[02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:23.000]  or was it a that's right that's right
[02:47:23.000 --> 02:47:25.000]  exactly what we had in 2005
[02:47:25.000 --> 02:47:27.000]  when we attended the deliver conference
[02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:29.000]  with Jim our sources gave us the report
[02:47:29.000 --> 02:47:31.000]  not a complete report because it wasn't
[02:47:31.000 --> 02:47:33.000]  written at the time but parts of the report
[02:47:33.000 --> 02:47:35.000]  and we're seeing their agenda
[02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:37.000]  on right now and again transhumanism
[02:47:37.000 --> 02:47:39.000]  is changing the face of society
[02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:41.000]  and people have to become aware
[02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:43.000]  that what's around us and what we are
[02:47:43.000 --> 02:47:45.000]  about to become in the very near future
[02:47:45.000 --> 02:47:47.000]  will be completely different
[02:47:47.000 --> 02:47:49.000]  from anything we have ever seen
[02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:51.000]  in the history of mankind
[02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:53.000]  that's right let me quantify this
[02:47:53.000 --> 02:47:55.000]  their scientists their doctors
[02:47:55.000 --> 02:47:57.000]  their technocrats the whole world's
[02:47:57.000 --> 02:47:59.000]  laboratory in their own words
[02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:01.000]  they believe out of this epic struggle
[02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:03.000]  in a war against general humanity
[02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:05.000]  in survival of the fittest
[02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:07.000]  they will become gods in the
[02:48:07.000 --> 02:48:09.000]  great cyber wars the great
[02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:11.000]  technocrat wars the biotech wars
[02:48:11.000 --> 02:48:13.000]  that are to come they have the underground
[02:48:13.000 --> 02:48:15.000]  bases the redoubts the supercomputers
[02:48:15.000 --> 02:48:17.000]  and that they will then rid
[02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:19.000]  the earth of the scourge of the proto-human
[02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:21.000]  as they see us and they will become
[02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:23.000]  I forget the exact term they use
[02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:25.000]  you know this sentient
[02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:27.000]  omnipresent super sapien
[02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:29.000]  and it is just totally
[02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:31.000]  delusional and in the end of the day
[02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:33.000]  we'll be lucky if they don't destroy the entire planet
[02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:35.000]  give me 10 seconds I'll just have to
[02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:37.000]  say this Alex you know they feel that
[02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:39.000]  they have enough technology right now
[02:48:39.000 --> 02:48:41.000]  to face the gods and beat them
[02:48:41.000 --> 02:48:43.000]  at their own game and they feel that
[02:48:43.000 --> 02:48:45.000]  they today are the gods
[02:48:45.000 --> 02:48:47.000]  that's right they don't
[02:48:47.000 --> 02:48:49.000]  let people at Bilderberg look at any of them
[02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:51.000]  and it just shows
[02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:53.000]  their total disconnect I talked to so many
[02:48:53.000 --> 02:48:55.000]  waiters and waitresses as you have after
[02:48:55.000 --> 02:48:57.000]  Bilderberg and they go we're going to give you all
[02:48:57.000 --> 02:48:59.000]  the info they were mean to us they never gave us tips
[02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:01.000]  they have no empathy no humanity
[02:49:01.000 --> 02:49:03.000]  they want everyone gone so it's all
[02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:05.000]  there's incredible book incredible
[02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:07.000]  job daniel you've got to come back

[02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:15.000]  best interview ever unbelievable
[02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:17.000]  how do I become up with a headline
[02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:21.000]  good enough to describe how epic
[02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:23.000]  these these issues are
[02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:25.000]  I mean that's why I don't go out to Hollywood
[02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:27.000]  anymore when famous people invite me out there
[02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:29.000]  why do I care that's why I don't care
[02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:31.000]  about being on red carpets and stuff and what does it do
[02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:33.000]  only if I could get those people
[02:49:33.000 --> 02:49:35.000]  to go public to try to cause
[02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:37.000]  an awakening and an understanding
[02:49:37.000 --> 02:49:39.000]  that's the only reason famous people are
[02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:41.000]  important
[02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:43.000]  you know I just
[02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:45.000]  wish there was a new planet to go to
[02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:49.000]  but we would carry with us the same seeds
[02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:51.000]  of our own destruction we've got a battle here
[02:49:51.000 --> 02:49:53.000]  we've got to go on to the end
[02:49:55.000 --> 02:49:57.000]  there's no where to run in the long
[02:49:57.000 --> 02:49:59.000]  run but it may come down to some people having
[02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:01.000]  to go to places that are safer they can operate
[02:50:01.000 --> 02:50:03.000]  better or they can have asylum
[02:50:05.000 --> 02:50:07.000]  but
[02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:09.000]  so many people say well it's time for violence
[02:50:11.000 --> 02:50:13.000]  defensively you have a right to defend yourself
[02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:15.000]  and when you're on the right that's what you got to do
[02:50:15.000 --> 02:50:17.000]  I'm not trying to stop you
[02:50:17.000 --> 02:50:19.000]  believe me I'm
[02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:21.000]  all about violence it's a good friend of mine
[02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:23.000]  feels good to stand up
[02:50:23.000 --> 02:50:25.000]  it feels good to be a man it feels good to be strong
[02:50:25.000 --> 02:50:27.000]  feels good to not be afraid
[02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:29.000]  you got to be smarter than that you got to go
[02:50:29.000 --> 02:50:31.000]  to the higher levels of warfare
[02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:33.000]  you got to just tell the truth and put the truth out there
[02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:35.000]  as a comparison
[02:50:37.000 --> 02:50:39.000]  to the other option
[02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:41.000]  that is the lie
[02:50:41.000 --> 02:50:43.000]  this is not a pretty place for going to
[02:50:43.000 --> 02:50:45.000]  look at your children
[02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:47.000]  and have a debate about it and when you go into church
[02:50:47.000 --> 02:50:49.000]  and you don't hear this being discussed
[02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:51.000]  and they got x-boxes back there with your kids at Sunday school
[02:50:51.000 --> 02:50:53.000]  and they're doing all this stuff
[02:50:53.000 --> 02:50:55.000]  and they're telling you how great the government is
[02:50:55.000 --> 02:50:57.000]  you're in a government run
[02:50:57.000 --> 02:50:59.000]  of absolute money changing devils
[02:50:59.000 --> 02:51:01.000]  and you know what Christ did

[02:54:37.000 --> 02:54:39.000]  so they can enjoy their crimes
[02:54:39.000 --> 02:54:41.000]  against humanity that much more
[02:54:41.000 --> 02:54:43.000]  you know my biggest issue is
[02:54:43.000 --> 02:54:45.000]  as I come to full grips
[02:54:45.000 --> 02:54:47.000]  with what we face as a civilization
[02:54:47.000 --> 02:54:49.000]  and as a species
[02:54:49.000 --> 02:54:51.000]  in our long history
[02:54:51.000 --> 02:54:53.000]  I realize that my life is a flash in the pan
[02:54:53.000 --> 02:54:55.000]  twinkle in the eye
[02:54:55.000 --> 02:54:57.000]  at the lilies of the field
[02:54:57.000 --> 02:54:59.000]  out out brief candle
[02:54:59.000 --> 02:55:01.000]  but that it is the great struggle
[02:55:01.000 --> 02:55:03.000]  of the race
[02:55:03.000 --> 02:55:05.000]  to uplift ourselves and become nobler
[02:55:05.000 --> 02:55:07.000]  that I am part of and that you are part of
[02:55:07.000 --> 02:55:09.000]  and that what matters to me
[02:55:09.000 --> 02:55:11.000]  is that we make it to the next level
[02:55:11.000 --> 02:55:13.000]  and don't destroy ourselves
[02:55:13.000 --> 02:55:15.000]  and the greatest crime
[02:55:15.000 --> 02:55:17.000]  of establishment is telling us
[02:55:17.000 --> 02:55:19.000]  how bad we are all day
[02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:21.000]  except when the leader comes out
[02:55:21.000 --> 02:55:23.000]  Obama and then he tells us we're good
[02:55:23.000 --> 02:55:25.000]  and so we go oh he must be good
[02:55:25.000 --> 02:55:27.000]  because he's telling us we're good
[02:55:27.000 --> 02:55:29.000]  I mean it's disgusting
[02:55:29.000 --> 02:55:31.000]  they know exactly what they're doing
[02:55:31.000 --> 02:55:33.000]  and it's like watching
[02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:35.000]  a navy seal
[02:55:35.000 --> 02:55:37.000]  beat up a newborn baby
[02:55:37.000 --> 02:55:39.000]  it's like watching
[02:55:39.000 --> 02:55:41.000]  an NFL linebacker
[02:55:41.000 --> 02:55:43.000]  beat up a one year old
[02:55:43.000 --> 02:55:45.000]  I mean it's really pathetic
[02:55:45.000 --> 02:55:47.000]  that they sit there
[02:55:47.000 --> 02:55:49.000]  and abuse these people and then laugh at them
[02:55:49.000 --> 02:55:51.000]  it's disgusting
[02:55:53.000 --> 02:55:55.000]  and I personally
[02:55:55.000 --> 02:55:57.000]  get to the point up here
[02:55:57.000 --> 02:55:59.000]  where trying to run this operation
[02:55:59.000 --> 02:56:01.000]  everything we do
[02:56:01.000 --> 02:56:03.000]  and the way the establishment tries to guilt
[02:56:03.000 --> 02:56:05.000]  anyone in new media that tries to fund themselves
[02:56:05.000 --> 02:56:07.000]  I mean it's all just mind games
[02:56:07.000 --> 02:56:09.000]  manipulating good people
[02:56:09.000 --> 02:56:11.000]  and it's time to vote with your dollars
[02:56:11.000 --> 02:56:13.000]  and it's time to spread the word
[02:56:13.000 --> 02:56:15.000]  about news sites like infowars.com
[02:56:15.000 --> 02:56:17.000]  prismbunna.com
[02:56:17.000 --> 02:56:19.000]  rougeport.com it's such a beacon of liberty
[02:56:19.000 --> 02:56:21.000]  it's time to really
[02:56:21.000 --> 02:56:23.000]  get behind the sources that will
[02:56:23.000 --> 02:56:25.000]  talk about the real issues that matter
[02:56:25.000 --> 02:56:27.000]  and actually put those on the front of the table
[02:56:27.000 --> 02:56:29.000]  our ascension
[02:56:29.000 --> 02:56:31.000]  is a great responsibility
[02:56:31.000 --> 02:56:33.000]  but it's only happening because
[02:56:33.000 --> 02:56:35.000]  great tyranny is rising
[02:56:35.000 --> 02:56:37.000]  it's a battle, it's a war
[02:56:37.000 --> 02:56:39.000]  it's not a bunch of narcissistic baloney
[02:56:39.000 --> 02:56:41.000]  it's a struggle
[02:56:41.000 --> 02:56:43.000]  and you will find in that animating struggle
[02:56:43.000 --> 02:56:45.000]  of liberty, that animating contest
[02:56:45.000 --> 02:56:47.000]  you will find your humanity
[02:56:47.000 --> 02:56:49.000]  and I know you know that but don't
[02:56:49.000 --> 02:56:51.000]  just take our incredible reports for granted
[02:56:51.000 --> 02:56:53.000]  that are on prismplanet.tv and the youtube channel
[02:56:53.000 --> 02:56:55.000]  don't just take
[02:56:55.000 --> 02:56:57.000]  the news sites and the articles for granted
[02:56:57.000 --> 02:56:59.000]  I mean it is hard work to ever get to this point
[02:56:59.000 --> 02:57:01.000]  a lot of prayers, a lot of providence
[02:57:01.000 --> 02:57:03.000]  and I'm telling myself that
[02:57:03.000 --> 02:57:05.000]  I better appreciate
[02:57:05.000 --> 02:57:07.000]  the position I'm in
[02:57:07.000 --> 02:57:09.000]  to understand that I can't get
[02:57:09.000 --> 02:57:11.000]  I can't get
[02:57:11.000 --> 02:57:13.000]  target fatigue
[02:57:13.000 --> 02:57:15.000]  being so close to this get acclimated
[02:57:15.000 --> 02:57:17.000]  to just how big a situation
[02:57:17.000 --> 02:57:19.000]  we're in
[02:57:19.000 --> 02:57:21.000]  and I do in closing for this hour before
[02:57:21.000 --> 02:57:23.000]  Joe Salente comes up, I haven't plugged all day

[02:57:41.000 --> 02:57:43.000]  nasonite out of the five other ingredients
[02:57:43.000 --> 02:57:45.000]  it can be taken with the survival shield
[02:57:45.000 --> 02:57:47.000]  but talk to your physician if you have any issues
[02:57:47.000 --> 02:57:49.000]  the life straws
[02:57:49.000 --> 02:57:51.000]  we got some combos and some specials
[02:57:51.000 --> 02:57:53.000]  running infowarslife.com

[02:58:05.000 --> 02:58:07.000]  this is not the time to have that instinct
[02:58:07.000 --> 02:58:09.000]  that was in the old system before we fell
[02:58:09.000 --> 02:58:11.000]  we're going into a very dangerous time
[02:58:11.000 --> 02:58:13.000]  where if you're not all in
[02:58:13.000 --> 02:58:15.000]  and don't spread the word about this broadcast
[02:58:15.000 --> 02:58:17.000]  and don't become president planet dot tv members
[02:58:17.000 --> 02:58:19.000]  and share your memberships
[02:58:19.000 --> 02:58:21.000]  if you don't buy the products at infowarslife.com
[02:58:21.000 --> 02:58:23.000]  I need a lot more money
