[00:00:00.934 --> 00:00:04.638]  I hereby declare this to be an unlawful assembly.
[00:00:04.638 --> 00:00:08.161]  I order all those assembled to immediately disperse.
[00:00:08.161 --> 00:00:10.303]  It's a military mission in North St.
[00:00:10.303 --> 00:00:10.944]  Louis.
[00:00:10.944 --> 00:00:18.030]  Heavily armored vehicles are rolling into town and don't be alarmed if you see those over the next seven days rolling through your neighborhood.
[00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:22.735]  If you see military helicopters flying low over Minneapolis, do not be alarmed.
[00:00:22.735 --> 00:00:23.596]  Guns will be taken.
[00:00:23.596 --> 00:00:25.057]  No one will be able to be armed.
[00:00:25.057 --> 00:00:26.038]  We will take all weapons.
[00:00:26.218 --> 00:00:28.560]  Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in.
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.044]  Just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[00:00:33.044 --> 00:00:33.865]  Enough.
[00:00:33.865 --> 00:00:34.666]  Enough.
[00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:35.687]  Enough.
[00:00:35.687 --> 00:00:36.067]  Enough.
[00:00:36.067 --> 00:00:40.551]  The Department of Homeland Security is apparently on a huge ammo buying spree.
[00:00:40.551 --> 00:00:44.415]  It comes out to like 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition.
[00:00:44.815 --> 00:00:51.562]  NSKS Late News 12's Jeff Ferrell discovered that clergy would help the government with potentially their biggest problem.
[00:00:51.562 --> 00:00:51.863]  Us.
[00:00:51.863 --> 00:00:59.611]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[00:00:59.611 --> 00:01:03.255]  If you've got a business, you didn't build that.
[00:01:03.255 --> 00:01:04.817]  Somebody else made that happen.
[00:01:05.663 --> 00:01:11.790]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatrics.
[00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.656]  Blackhawk choppers soaring through the night sky, but this is only a drill.
[00:01:16.656 --> 00:01:21.261]  Heavily armed officers in Watertown search for the suspect, house to house.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.183]  It's a joint military training exercise involving local police, also military.
[00:01:34.183 --> 00:01:35.364]  In your apartment!
[00:01:35.364 --> 00:01:36.485]  I am in my apartment, sir.
[00:01:36.485 --> 00:01:37.685]  Go back inside right now!
[00:01:37.685 --> 00:01:38.686]  I am inside.
[00:01:38.686 --> 00:01:40.547]  I have two words for you.
[00:01:40.547 --> 00:01:42.328]  Predator gloves.
[00:01:42.328 --> 00:01:43.329]  You will never see it coming.
[00:01:47.287 --> 00:01:50.208]  The dramatic scene played out in front of our cameras.
[00:01:50.208 --> 00:01:59.692]  Parents grabbing their children and running after spending the night hunkering in their houses and then finding themselves face-to-face with the muzzle of a SWAT officer's rifle.
[00:01:59.692 --> 00:02:05.254]  They let them in the area, they told them they could come in, and now they're coming in like they're trespassers, punching and shoving people.
[00:02:05.254 --> 00:02:10.396]  We're not turning our guns in, and we're not running, and we're not backing down!
[00:02:10.396 --> 00:02:12.497]  If you want them, come and take them!
[00:02:14.155 --> 00:02:16.036]  We are on the march.
[00:02:16.036 --> 00:02:18.937]  The Empire is on the run.
[00:02:18.937 --> 00:02:23.739]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:02:38.873 --> 00:02:44.527]  The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.
[00:02:44.527 --> 00:02:47.614]  This is the heart of 1776!
[00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:02.651]  Lay down G.I., lay down G.I.
[00:03:02.651 --> 00:03:05.134]  We saw it all through the 20th century.
[00:03:05.134 --> 00:03:08.337]  And now in the 21st century, it's time to stand up and realize.
[00:03:14.724 --> 00:03:17.867]  That we should not allow ourselves to be crammed into this rat maze.
[00:03:17.867 --> 00:03:20.669]  We should not submit to dehumanization.
[00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:24.272]  I don't know about you, but I'm concerned with what's happening in this world.
[00:03:24.272 --> 00:03:25.993]  I'm concerned with the structure.
[00:03:25.993 --> 00:03:28.255]  I'm concerned with the systems of control.
[00:03:28.255 --> 00:03:32.699]  Those that control my life, and those that seek to control it even more!
[00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:33.720]  I want freedom!
[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.022]  That's what I want, and that's what you should want!
[00:03:36.602 --> 00:03:45.105]  It's up to each and every one of us to turn loose of just some of the greed, the hatred, the envy, and yes, the insecurities, because that is the central mode of control.
[00:03:45.105 --> 00:03:51.548]  Make us feel pathetic, small, so we'll willingly give up our sovereignty, our liberty, our destiny.
[00:03:52.168 --> 00:03:56.693]  We have got to realize that we're being conditioned on a mass scale.
[00:03:56.693 --> 00:03:59.437]  Start challenging this corporate slave state.
[00:03:59.437 --> 00:04:06.405]  The 21st century is going to be a new century, not the century of slavery, not the century of lies and individual indifference and classism.
[00:04:08.046 --> 00:04:16.068]  It's gonna be the age of humankind standing up for something pure and something right.
[00:04:16.068 --> 00:04:19.089]  What a bunch of garbage, liberal, democrat, conservative, republican.
[00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:23.291]  It's all there to control you, two sides of the same coin.
[00:04:23.291 --> 00:04:28.992]  Two management teams bidding for control, the CEO job of slavery incorporated.
[00:04:28.992 --> 00:04:31.593]  The truth is out there in front of you, but they lay out this
[00:04:31.673 --> 00:04:32.974]  Buffet of lies!
[00:04:32.974 --> 00:04:33.514]  I'm sick of it!
[00:04:33.514 --> 00:04:35.756]  And I'm not going to take a bite out of it!
[00:04:35.756 --> 00:04:36.657]  Do you got me?
[00:04:36.657 --> 00:04:40.640]  Human kind is too good!
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.581]  We're not a bunch of underachievers!
[00:04:42.581 --> 00:04:45.804]  We're going to stand up and we're going to be human beings!
[00:04:45.804 --> 00:04:48.526]  We're going to act like real things!
[00:04:48.526 --> 00:04:49.947]  The things that matter!
[00:04:49.947 --> 00:04:54.891]  Creativity and the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit!
[00:04:54.891 --> 00:04:55.451]  Well that's it!
[00:04:55.451 --> 00:04:56.612]  That's all I've got to say!
[00:04:56.612 --> 00:04:57.373]  Continue your court!
[00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:11.017]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[00:05:11.017 --> 00:05:13.098]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[00:05:13.098 --> 00:05:13.979]  Fluoride!
[00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:15.900]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:22.465]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[00:05:22.465 --> 00:05:27.228]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:30.930]  We're good.
[00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:02.181]  Introducing Pro-1.

[00:06:05.822 --> 00:06:10.343]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[00:06:10.343 --> 00:06:16.465]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[00:06:16.465 --> 00:06:27.249]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals all in one filter element.
[00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:33.951]  It is the only one that does it, and out of the gates, we have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[00:06:33.951 --> 00:06:51.256]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands, and sodium hexafluorosilicate.

[00:07:20.658 --> 00:07:24.620]  My Patriot Supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:30.583]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:07:30.583 --> 00:07:33.745]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.

[00:08:11.937 --> 00:08:13.458]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.458 --> 00:08:17.663]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.663 --> 00:08:21.748]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:23.651 --> 00:08:26.255]  Well, here's the CBS News headline.
[00:08:26.255 --> 00:08:28.858]  It's one of the top stories in the country now.
[00:08:28.858 --> 00:08:33.845]  All because one man, we've learned, is one of our listeners on his own Facebook site.
[00:08:33.845 --> 00:08:37.650]  We're getting him on probably in the middle of the next hour or the nightly news tonight.
[00:08:38.431 --> 00:08:57.084]  A gentleman during the NVP press conference, right at the start of it, with more than 10 million viewers, they estimate, still watching, Matthew Mills, 30, of New York, took over and simply said 9-11 was an inside job, orchestrated by inside forces, and the government needs to be investigated.
[00:08:57.084 --> 00:08:58.545]  And now here's the headlines.
[00:08:58.545 --> 00:09:03.508]  NVP, Malcolm Smith, interrupted by man calling for a 9-11 probe.
[00:09:03.508 --> 00:09:07.771]  The New York Times calls it conspiracy theorist hijacks press conference.
[00:09:08.811 --> 00:09:14.095]  No, we've proven, and six of the ten commissioners have said that it was a cover-up.
[00:09:14.095 --> 00:09:16.096]  We know there was a NORAD stand-down.
[00:09:16.096 --> 00:09:17.957]  We know those towers were blown up.
[00:09:17.957 --> 00:09:19.158]  We know there's a cover-up.
[00:09:19.158 --> 00:09:37.410]  And someone out there, more than anybody other than myself, who's had the courage to be the tip of the spear exposing 9-11 truth, until the point they won't even have him on places like Fox News anymore because he wins these debates bringing up Tower 7, is former Minnesota governor, best-selling author,
[00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:47.236]  Host of Conspiracy Theory on TruTV now has his own unfiltered, you know, tape-to-air or live sometimes show that I've been on.
[00:09:47.236 --> 00:09:52.160]  Off the Grid Television and ORATV Off the Grid.
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:58.204]  ORA.TV forward slash Off the Grid or just type in Jesse Ventura Off the Grid or type in Jesse Ventura YouTube.
[00:09:58.204 --> 00:09:59.105]  You can find it all.
[00:09:59.645 --> 00:10:06.909]  And this is what I love seeing happen, this revolution of individuals doing their own shows, totally uncensored, unfiltered.
[00:10:06.909 --> 00:10:07.930]  And so we're going to talk about that.
[00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:09.611]  He's with us for the rest of the hour.
[00:10:09.611 --> 00:10:10.892]  Great look in sight.
[00:10:10.892 --> 00:10:15.734]  Jesse Ventura off the grid at Aura.tv, just like PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:10:17.075 --> 00:10:18.696]  And he joins us right now.
[00:10:18.696 --> 00:10:20.716]  But first, he's down in Mexico.
[00:10:20.716 --> 00:10:33.860]  I want to play this clip for him and get his take on this 30-year-old Matthew Mills who snuck through security, infiltrated, got on one of the employee buses to infiltrate, to tell the truth.
[00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:38.502]  True special forces for the truth and America against this inside job.
[00:10:38.502 --> 00:10:40.543]  Here is part of the clip.
[00:10:40.543 --> 00:10:44.404]  I always imagined myself making great plays, but you never think about being a VP.
[00:10:47.919 --> 00:10:49.760]  Investigate 9-11.
[00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:54.061]  9-11 was perpetrated by people within our own government.
[00:10:54.061 --> 00:10:59.003]  And again, that simple statement and then they're freaking out in their response all over the news last night and today.
[00:10:59.003 --> 00:11:02.444]  This is all over every news channel causing a giant debate.
[00:11:02.444 --> 00:11:07.846]  It shows that, number one, they're fake security is a complete fraud with the gunships and the groping of the checkpoints.
[00:11:07.846 --> 00:11:09.287]  Governor, great to have you back with us.
[00:11:09.827 --> 00:11:11.648]  Thanks Alex, great to be here.
[00:11:11.648 --> 00:11:14.608]  Geez, I watched the Super Bowl from off the grid.
[00:11:14.608 --> 00:11:23.011]  I was able to watch the game yesterday and unfortunately I went back home and I didn't see the MVP presentation.
[00:11:23.011 --> 00:11:27.452]  By the way, just for my note, who did win the MVP?
[00:11:27.452 --> 00:11:29.272]  Who did win the MVP?
[00:11:29.272 --> 00:11:31.793]  That was Malcolm Smith of the Seahawks.
[00:11:32.406 --> 00:11:32.746]  Really?
[00:11:32.746 --> 00:11:40.171]  Okay, well, I knew someone from the Seahawks would win because they obviously dominated the game and overwhelmingly won it.
[00:11:40.171 --> 00:11:48.256]  They did a great job for Seattle, but that's amazing that somebody got that in there and that's been all over the news today.
[00:11:48.256 --> 00:11:49.616]  That's wonderful.
[00:11:49.616 --> 00:11:51.618]  I couldn't be happier.
[00:11:51.618 --> 00:12:00.303]  I tip my hat to that gentleman that had the courage to do that and get people talking and thinking about stuff and getting the Lemmings to wake up up there.
[00:12:00.953 --> 00:12:03.714]  Well, it shows, Governor, as you know, the power of the individual.
[00:12:03.714 --> 00:12:13.458]  As somebody who called national NFL games on television and also there locally for the fans, what was it like for you to watch this?
[00:12:13.458 --> 00:12:16.599]  I think this was one of the most boring Super Bowls ever.
[00:12:16.599 --> 00:12:24.422]  And then watching with TSA grope people and the gunships and the snipers, this did not look like America.
[00:12:24.422 --> 00:12:26.523]  It looked like East Germany and Checkpoint Charlie.
[00:12:26.943 --> 00:12:30.067]  Well, that's why I do my show, you know.
[00:12:30.067 --> 00:12:33.111]  It's the fact that I'm outside the grid.
[00:12:33.111 --> 00:12:36.715]  I'm outside the United States broadcasting in.
[00:12:36.715 --> 00:12:39.899]  Because the United States is getting like East Berlin.
[00:12:39.899 --> 00:12:42.502]  They're taking away our rights and freedoms.
[00:12:42.502 --> 00:12:45.386]  People need to understand that the Constitution and the Bill of Rights
[00:12:45.926 --> 00:12:49.009]  Are there to protect the people against the government.
[00:12:49.009 --> 00:12:52.251]  Those are our documents that ensure our freedom.
[00:12:52.251 --> 00:12:57.376]  And when the government starts to violate those documents, we can't allow that to happen.
[00:12:57.376 --> 00:13:01.099]  It's that simple because that's what makes our country the great nation that it is.
[00:13:01.759 --> 00:13:12.648]  And for this guy to penetrate the Super Bowl and be able to say on national TV, 9-11 was an inside job and now they're all up and outraged and irate.
[00:13:12.648 --> 00:13:17.252]  It'll be interesting to see what the end result of this and the backlash of this is.
[00:13:17.252 --> 00:13:19.634]  Will people become more aware?
[00:13:19.634 --> 00:13:25.259]  But they're going to try to marginalize this guy and say that he's some sort of nutcase, naturally.
[00:13:25.546 --> 00:13:34.930]  Well, if you go up to Google and put in 9-11 inside job and click news, there are literally thousands of articles all over the world, TV.
[00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:39.733]  They are taking what he did, kind of like when I got on Piers Morgan, and just putting it everywhere.
[00:13:39.733 --> 00:13:44.495]  Those 15 seconds literally just showed what a fraud the whole thing is.
[00:13:44.495 --> 00:13:50.678]  What is your angle on the fact that, I mean, I think it shows that it's total security theater that this guy was able to do that.
[00:13:51.269 --> 00:14:00.316]  Well, it shows how vulnerable everything is, though, too, Alex, because you think at the Super Bowl, you know, that would be a lockdown situation.
[00:14:00.316 --> 00:14:03.118]  How protected was the Super Bowl yesterday?
[00:14:03.118 --> 00:14:06.160]  They really had helicopters flying around?
[00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:09.022]  Was it truly that difficult to get in?
[00:14:09.022 --> 00:14:10.823]  Would you have to go through three metal detectors?
[00:14:10.823 --> 00:14:11.944]  Let me break it down.
[00:14:11.944 --> 00:14:19.170]  Jakari Jackson, our reporter, along with our camera guy, who had to leave their cameras behind, obviously, were there for three days before and during covering it.
[00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:28.232]  And I had to buy them, by the time we got tickets, $1,700 for nosebleeds almost at the very back of that giant stadium.
[00:14:28.232 --> 00:14:30.513]  They do not allow cabs to get within a mile of it.
[00:14:30.513 --> 00:14:32.193]  They do not allow taxis.
[00:14:32.193 --> 00:14:33.893]  They do not allow limos.
[00:14:33.893 --> 00:14:39.435]  You have to get on a train and wait two hours each time on trains.
[00:14:39.435 --> 00:14:43.696]  People collapsed inside the train sitting there for hours in the heat because they had heaters on.
[00:14:43.696 --> 00:14:45.476]  That was in the news.
[00:14:45.476 --> 00:14:47.577]  They would then bus you and it would then take another
[00:14:48.533 --> 00:15:03.454]  Two hours after the train gets there to go through security, where they search your bags, grope your body, metal detector you, and then do it again, and then do it again, as you just said, but then no one ever scanned or checked their ticket.
[00:15:03.454 --> 00:15:03.634]  Ever.
[00:15:04.395 --> 00:15:09.897]  You know, Alex, the question needs to be asked this, and this is what I believe the people need to be asking the government, is why, if we're indeed that
[00:15:33.519 --> 00:15:43.425]  We're vulnerable and we're really that much under attack that the United States is now turning into East Berlin with its security precautions?
[00:15:43.425 --> 00:15:47.408]  We need to ask the million dollar question.
[00:15:47.408 --> 00:15:47.928]  Why?
[00:15:47.928 --> 00:15:56.634]  What have we done, and I'll repeat that, what have we done to incur the anger of people throughout the world to this extent?
[00:15:57.378 --> 00:16:00.541]  Because that's what we need to be looking at.
[00:16:00.541 --> 00:16:06.445]  What is causing people to hate the United States to the extent that they are?
[00:16:06.445 --> 00:16:09.828]  We used to be looked up to.
[00:16:09.828 --> 00:16:14.532]  Everywhere in the world used to look up and try to emulate the United States of America.
[00:16:14.532 --> 00:16:15.713]  They all wanted to be us.
[00:16:16.641 --> 00:16:18.262]  You know, they all wanted that.
[00:16:18.262 --> 00:16:21.302]  But today, there's nobody doing that anymore.
[00:16:21.302 --> 00:16:36.127]  And if we have to lock down our country for fear of attack from some unknown entities, well then we need to start looking in the mirror saying, what are we doing that is causing this type of behavior throughout the world?
[00:16:37.071 --> 00:16:42.774]  You know, we certainly didn't have to protect our Super Bowls 20 years ago like this.
[00:16:42.774 --> 00:16:47.556]  I mean, naturally, there's always been some type of security at every event.
[00:16:47.556 --> 00:16:50.978]  But as you stated, the security was to make sure people had tickets.
[00:16:51.747 --> 00:16:55.751]  You know, because it used to be you had to worry about scalpers and people sneaking in.
[00:16:55.751 --> 00:17:00.656]  Well, and you had real police out there who knew what to look for.
[00:17:00.656 --> 00:17:01.717]  You know what it is, Governor.
[00:17:01.717 --> 00:17:08.704]  It's about training us to be slaves, training us for the police state, training us for a lockdown America during a financial collapse.
[00:17:08.704 --> 00:17:13.929]  Why do you think they're setting up what I would call classical incremental martial law?
[00:17:13.929 --> 00:17:16.071]  What do you think it's in preparation for, Jesse Ventura?
[00:17:16.371 --> 00:17:23.533]  Well, it troubles me greatly because obviously somebody feels there's going to be a need for martial law.
[00:17:23.533 --> 00:17:23.953]  That's right.
[00:17:23.953 --> 00:17:32.556]  And I can't, for the life of me, figure out if our society is what we deem it to be, why there would ever be a need for martial law.
[00:17:32.556 --> 00:17:45.820]  What in the United States of Ameri... You know, people need to wake up and realize that they have a... Each of us as individuals have about as much chance of being attacked by a terrorist as we do winning the Powerball.
[00:17:47.521 --> 00:17:56.331]  And yet, we're preparing like some sort of Al-Qaeda invasion of Normandy is going to happen at Virginia Beach, Virginia.
[00:17:56.331 --> 00:17:57.813]  And it's insane.
[00:17:57.813 --> 00:17:59.655]  And I have to agree with you, Alex.
[00:18:00.316 --> 00:18:12.081]  The people in the know must be preparing for something that they sure don't want us to know about because this lockdown of America over 9-11 and over the Patriot Act is utterly absurd.
[00:18:12.081 --> 00:18:19.925]  It's time to get rid of the Patriot Act and take the country back to what it used to be instead of this police state they're turning it into.
[00:18:20.945 --> 00:18:27.350]  My issue is they just keep accelerating it to where more and more it sounds like a good idea to leave the country like you've done.
[00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:36.058]  Shifting gears, I believe as you've said, getting off the grid, becoming self-sufficient, that's how you make sure you can't be domesticated.
[00:18:36.058 --> 00:18:42.964]  This system wants you on food stamps, it wants you dependent, it wants you scared, not having your own guns, with police all around with guns.
[00:18:43.504 --> 00:18:51.230]  They want us domesticated, so I want to spend a few minutes before we get back into the news and this latest overdose and the heroin out of Afghanistan.
[00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:58.015]  I want to ask Governor Jesse Ventura, because I had a lot of fun being on your show last week, uncensored, and it was just great.
[00:18:58.015 --> 00:19:01.298]  I was on Skype, you were on Skype, felt like I was there in the room with you.
[00:19:01.298 --> 00:19:05.201]  Spend a few minutes talking about some of the shows you're doing.
[00:19:05.201 --> 00:19:13.247]  I mean, you're doing them, what, four days a week at least, and some of the stuff that's coming up, because, I mean, this is the type of show that I personally am going to be watching.
[00:19:13.507 --> 00:19:23.130]  Well, it's fun for me, Alex, because as you know, since I left office, I've had a very difficult time getting my message out there.
[00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:28.452]  You stated earlier, Fox News won't have me on, MSNBC won't have me on.
[00:19:28.452 --> 00:19:31.233]  CNN allows me on a little bit.
[00:19:31.233 --> 00:19:36.634]  My last book, because it dealt with the Kennedy killing, none of the major networks would have me on.
[00:19:36.634 --> 00:19:40.356]  Not NBC, not ABC, not CBS, Fox, none of them.
[00:19:42.262 --> 00:19:58.752]  I've always, since I got out of office in 2003 when I had that debacle that happened at MSNBC where they wouldn't put me on the air because I opposed the war in Iraq and they paid me for three years and literally handcuffed me and kept me off the air.
[00:19:58.752 --> 00:20:01.213]  Since then I've been fighting to find a way.
[00:20:01.213 --> 00:20:03.975]  How can I talk to the American people unfiltered?
[00:20:03.975 --> 00:20:10.559]  How can I talk to the American people without it being on these stations that decide whether I can come on or not?
[00:20:11.079 --> 00:20:12.401]  We're good to go.
[00:20:28.041 --> 00:20:29.362]  That's how it all started.
[00:20:29.362 --> 00:20:35.387]  Ora TV does Larry King and they got interested then in me and they felt I was a voice that needed to be heard.
[00:20:35.387 --> 00:20:50.980]  The important thing is the owner of the company is not from the United States of America, so therefore he has no dog in the fight when I want to criticize our policy and be an engaged American citizen and be vigilant.
[00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:56.184]  A term that I've been using from the start that I like to assume President Obama stole from me.
[00:20:56.798 --> 00:20:57.718]  We're good to go.
[00:21:17.783 --> 00:21:18.124]  I think so.
[00:21:36.304 --> 00:21:39.846]  Have an hour, hour and a half long show that's going to work that well.
[00:21:39.846 --> 00:21:40.446]  I don't think so.
[00:21:40.446 --> 00:21:45.508]  It worked out terrific for me and it lets me live in sheer freedom down here.
[00:21:45.508 --> 00:21:48.490]  And we'll be moving it about too, the show Alex.
[00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:50.871]  We don't want them to get a pinpoint on us.
[00:21:50.871 --> 00:21:53.032]  We don't want them finding us with drones.
[00:21:53.032 --> 00:21:56.913]  So we'll be doing the shows at different locations off the grid.
[00:21:56.913 --> 00:21:58.014]  We'll keep them guessing.
[00:21:59.093 --> 00:22:03.176]  Well, it's just really exciting, the revolution of true independent media.
[00:22:03.176 --> 00:22:08.040]  Larry King, when they kicked him off three years ago, had 2 million listeners, viewers a night.
[00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:13.023]  Piers Morgan, and I know you know him, he has you on, you know, it's down to about 400,000.
[00:22:13.023 --> 00:22:16.686]  MSNBC has gone from a million down to about 300,000.
[00:22:16.686 --> 00:22:20.849]  I mean, back when you were on MSNBC, they had 5 million viewers, 10 million viewers some nights.
[00:22:21.409 --> 00:22:27.894]  Mainstream media isn't just dying because of the internet, because my show is just exploding and many others are.
[00:22:27.894 --> 00:22:29.215]  It's the content.
[00:22:29.215 --> 00:22:35.719]  But they're still, I mean, Larry King wasn't controllable enough for them, so they got him off CNN.
[00:22:35.719 --> 00:22:39.062]  And it just shows, what do you, Jesse Ventura, you're a smart guy, you're savvy.
[00:22:39.662 --> 00:22:42.164]  Where do you see the media wars going?
[00:22:42.164 --> 00:22:44.446]  Where do you see the establishment going?
[00:22:44.446 --> 00:22:49.449]  Where do you see, you know, all the new banker bailouts, all the corruption?
[00:22:49.449 --> 00:22:54.013]  What is your gut about where the future of humanity is going?
[00:22:54.013 --> 00:22:58.336]  Well, you know, to me, when you're talking communications, it's the Internet.
[00:22:58.336 --> 00:23:02.139]  I mean, you know, it's taking over so strong now.
[00:23:02.139 --> 00:23:03.240]  That's why I'm on it.
[00:23:04.334 --> 00:23:09.697]  The freedom of being on it, and you can rest assured the government is going to try to get control of it.
[00:23:09.697 --> 00:23:12.179]  They've got to, from their perspective.
[00:23:12.179 --> 00:23:15.341]  If they're going to control us, they've got to control the internet.
[00:23:15.341 --> 00:23:18.543]  I personally hope they never, ever get control of it.
[00:23:18.543 --> 00:23:20.023]  I love the freedom of it.
[00:23:20.023 --> 00:23:24.166]  It falls right under freedom of speech, our First Amendment, and the Bill of Rights.
[00:23:24.166 --> 00:23:32.911]  We have the right to speak freely, and the Bill of Rights, freedom of speech, as I've said so often, it's there to protect unpopular speech.
[00:23:33.331 --> 00:23:36.272]  Because popular speech doesn't need protecting.
[00:23:36.272 --> 00:23:38.533]  It's unpopular speech that needs protecting.
[00:23:38.533 --> 00:23:39.593]  That's right.
[00:23:39.593 --> 00:23:43.035]  Or speech that goes against the status quo.
[00:23:43.035 --> 00:23:46.656]  It may be minority speech you're talking about here.
[00:23:46.656 --> 00:23:48.637]  Excuse me.
[00:23:48.637 --> 00:23:52.679]  Something that the majority doesn't necessarily can control.
[00:23:52.679 --> 00:23:56.240]  And that's what's important about the internet.
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:57.380]  Well, that's right.
[00:23:57.380 --> 00:23:58.681]  Alex, I think the internet
[00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:02.822]  And I'm probably being very liberal here.
[00:24:02.822 --> 00:24:07.785]  I see the internet taking over all communications within a decade.
[00:24:07.785 --> 00:24:08.506]  Oh, I agree.
[00:24:08.506 --> 00:24:08.926]  Totally.
[00:24:08.926 --> 00:24:09.887]  No, I think you're right.
[00:24:11.004 --> 00:24:12.265]  Well, you know, and that may be the case.
[00:24:12.265 --> 00:24:14.547]  It's like the old saying from Deep Throat, Alex.
[00:24:14.547 --> 00:24:15.147]  Follow the money.
[00:24:38.053 --> 00:24:39.355]  Uh, the money allegia.
[00:24:39.355 --> 00:24:42.558]  You know, money's what gets government to react.
[00:24:42.558 --> 00:24:44.020]  Money, money, money.
[00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:47.904]  If there's money to be made, government wants a piece of it.
[00:24:47.904 --> 00:24:50.867]  On another note, we'll switch gears here.
[00:24:50.867 --> 00:24:57.434]  Again, I want to talk about, you know, and this makes a good transition to the war on drugs that you wanted to talk about.
[00:24:58.209 --> 00:25:07.552]  I'm so proud of the states of Washington and Colorado, the two Super Bowl participants, but I'm even more proud of them not for their Super Bowl football teams.
[00:25:07.552 --> 00:25:19.515]  I'm proud of them because they have voted the people in those states to legalize marijuana and strike a blow against this war on drugs that in a free society should never be happening.
[00:25:19.515 --> 00:25:22.016]  Drug addiction should be treated medically.
[00:25:22.777 --> 00:25:26.661]  Addiction should be treated medically, not criminally.
[00:25:26.661 --> 00:25:28.984]  You can be addicted to anything.
[00:25:28.984 --> 00:25:31.847]  Imagine the addiction to coffee.
[00:25:31.847 --> 00:25:34.230]  Now, and that's a powerful addiction.
[00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:36.232]  I remember when I was in the Navy.
[00:25:36.232 --> 00:25:39.876]  If you didn't make the coffee, the chiefs were ready to hang you from the yardarm.
[00:25:41.004 --> 00:25:43.107]  You know, and I never drink coffee.
[00:25:43.107 --> 00:25:44.789]  I've never been a coffee addict.
[00:25:44.789 --> 00:25:53.460]  But when you watch people not get their morning cup of coffee, and you watch how it affects them in their daily life, clearly it's a powerful addiction.
[00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:57.565]  Well, again, addiction, you can be addicted to Hostess Twinkie.
[00:25:57.805 --> 00:25:58.565]  For that matter.
[00:25:58.565 --> 00:25:59.005]  Exactly.
[00:25:59.005 --> 00:26:03.247]  You're not going to arrest people for sugar, though now Bloomberg, the outgoing mayor, wants that.
[00:26:03.247 --> 00:26:06.247]  Let me shift gears before we get into the drugs, because I want to tie it in.
[00:26:06.247 --> 00:26:07.108]  We're about to go to break.
[00:26:07.108 --> 00:26:10.068]  I want to come back and talk about the dead actor who I was a fan of.
[00:26:10.068 --> 00:26:16.750]  He was a great actor and this super heroin that killed him and tie it in, you know, to how the drugs are being shipped in from Afghanistan and get your take on that.
[00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:21.232]  But since you mentioned censorship of journalism and the Internet, as you know, we'll put the L.A.
[00:26:21.232 --> 00:26:22.732]  Times article on screen.
[00:26:23.532 --> 00:26:24.473]  Los Angeles Times.
[00:26:24.473 --> 00:26:25.314]  Who's a journalist?
[00:26:25.314 --> 00:26:35.622]  Senator Dianne Feinstein wants to draw a line and literally shut down bloggers, talk radio, you name it, and not let us have journalistic protections.
[00:26:35.622 --> 00:26:37.604]  She's absolutely a monster.
[00:26:37.604 --> 00:26:40.286]  And you've got John D. Rockefeller, the senator.
[00:26:40.846 --> 00:26:41.207]  I don't know.
[00:26:59.289 --> 00:27:06.473]  As a consultant and saying, Governor, I just want to say congratulations for putting the most powerful television on ever.
[00:27:06.473 --> 00:27:12.256]  Your FEMA special exposes the whole takeover plan, the whole plan with the FEMA centers.
[00:27:12.256 --> 00:27:18.920]  I cannot believe this got on air with almost 2 million viewers, record views for a new show on True TV.
[00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:30.151]  Then Congress gets involved, all of it happens, the way you skewered that congressman, and they killed it airing again when they normally air it 50 more times, so it's seen by upwards of 50 million people.
[00:27:30.151 --> 00:27:31.813]  Most re-airs have a million viewers.
[00:27:31.813 --> 00:27:40.182]  Incredible to see that that so threatened the establishment that within hours they flipped out.
[00:27:40.182 --> 00:27:41.023]  Can you speak to that?
[00:27:41.553 --> 00:27:50.117]  Well, it was, I don't know if you want to call it an honor to be taken down on the Congressional floor, but that's what actually happened.
[00:27:50.117 --> 00:27:59.521]  Congressman Cohen, the guy who co-sponsored the bill to build these FEMA camps, actually chastised me and my show on the floors of Congress.
[00:28:00.294 --> 00:28:06.437]  And I guess I should take that for a compliment to get that far, but you're right.
[00:28:06.437 --> 00:28:08.118]  That show never aired again.
[00:28:08.118 --> 00:28:11.620]  They then removed it and wouldn't even acknowledge that we did it.
[00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:12.560]  They took it off Kivo.
[00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:14.361]  They took it off the cable servers.
[00:28:14.361 --> 00:28:15.582]  Oh yeah, they did all that.
[00:28:15.582 --> 00:28:26.307]  So people out there that believe that we're not already being operated under a certain censorship are naive and sadly mistaken and they better wake up to the fact that
[00:28:26.847 --> 00:28:43.081]  You know, even a show like mine, when it comes out and tells the truth on a particular subject, if it offends too many of the status quo in the government, they'll step in and do what they did to that show and basically remove it so that more people can't ever see it.
[00:28:43.081 --> 00:28:50.268]  But it's still out there, because the great thing about the internet today is once it's shown once, it's going to be somewhere.
[00:28:51.055 --> 00:28:55.878]  Well, we're going to break, but I want to come back and get into the drug war, other key issues that you're focused on.
[00:28:55.878 --> 00:29:03.163]  But I wanted to raise that because people better appreciate PrisonPlanet.tv, the InfoWars Nightly News, our subscription service.
[00:29:03.163 --> 00:29:09.647]  They better appreciate Governor Ventura and O-R-A-T-V forward slash off the grid or a TV.
[00:29:09.647 --> 00:29:10.928]  They better appreciate
[00:29:11.408 --> 00:29:16.212]  That Ventura, four days a week, is producing a show that six days a week we're doing it.
[00:29:16.212 --> 00:29:16.892]  It's hard work.
[00:29:16.892 --> 00:29:17.793]  We're all in this together.
[00:29:17.793 --> 00:29:18.393]  We love freedom.
[00:29:18.393 --> 00:29:19.294]  It's why we do it.
[00:29:19.294 --> 00:29:21.475]  But it's not pearls before swine.
[00:29:21.475 --> 00:29:26.379]  Understand, folks, we're busting our butt, and the enemy, the establishment, does not like this.
[00:29:26.379 --> 00:29:30.442]  We've gone through a lot of trouble, a lot of threats, a lot of behind-the-scenes stuff.
[00:29:30.442 --> 00:29:32.503]  Ventura doesn't want people to even know about, and that's fine.
[00:29:32.503 --> 00:29:33.184]  I won't talk about it.
[00:29:33.644 --> 00:29:41.250]  I've been through it too, so we're brothers in arms in those shared experiences of trying to use our First Amendment and being so effective.
[00:29:41.250 --> 00:29:43.992]  Look at all the JFK people that have been killed or targeted.
[00:29:43.992 --> 00:29:47.635]  I want to talk about that with Ventura as well when we come back, but this is serious.
[00:29:47.635 --> 00:29:50.197]  This is war, so support us.
[00:29:50.197 --> 00:29:51.578]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.578 --> 00:29:54.520]  Become members at Aura.tv now and PrisonPlanet.tv.

[00:30:00.743 --> 00:30:04.084]  Globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[00:30:04.084 --> 00:30:06.504]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[00:30:06.504 --> 00:30:15.106]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[00:30:15.106 --> 00:30:23.068]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic
[00:30:23.408 --> 00:30:31.440]  Super male vitality formula sourced from powerful organic herbs and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:39.072]  Super male vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:30:39.452 --> 00:30:45.795]  Super Mel Vitality by InfoWarsLife is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[00:30:45.795 --> 00:30:54.540]  For a limited time, we are offering 15% off Super Mel Vitality at InfoWarsLife.com to introduce you to this powerful supplement.

[00:30:58.722 --> 00:30:59.562]  InfoWarsLife.com
[00:31:00.783 --> 00:31:09.870]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:18.276]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:31:18.276 --> 00:31:23.159]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:31:23.159 --> 00:31:29.524]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[00:31:29.924 --> 00:31:37.113]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:31:37.113 --> 00:31:44.142]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:31:44.142 --> 00:31:48.487]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:31:48.607 --> 00:31:51.988]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[00:31:51.988 --> 00:31:58.291]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:31:58.291 --> 00:32:00.772]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:32:00.772 --> 00:32:01.812]  The facts are in.
[00:32:01.812 --> 00:32:03.213]  The studies are legion.
[00:32:03.213 --> 00:32:10.736]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[00:32:10.736 --> 00:32:14.157]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[00:32:14.537 --> 00:32:15.117]  Simple.
[00:32:15.117 --> 00:32:19.840]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:25.562]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[00:32:25.562 --> 00:32:31.085]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars line fluoride shield formulation.
[00:32:31.085 --> 00:32:41.890]  Fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[00:32:41.890 --> 00:32:43.731]  Let's take a stand against the globalists.
[00:32:43.851 --> 00:32:47.253]  Perhaps when these mystery and control freaks look into the Panopticon,
[00:33:13.502 --> 00:33:27.373]  of Gadham in a shadow of a shadow, a grain of sand at the beach compared to the mind of God, the Supreme Being, perhaps they'll see how ugly they are spiritually and gain knowledge.
[00:33:27.373 --> 00:33:32.957]  Because they say with great knowledge comes great sorrow for those that are pure of heart.
[00:33:32.957 --> 00:33:40.263]  With this great knowledge, is it nothing but a magnifying glass so they can enjoy their crimes against humanity that much more?
[00:33:40.263 --> 00:33:42.444]  You know, my biggest issue is
[00:33:43.943 --> 00:33:59.157]  As I come to full grips with what we face as a civilization and as a species in our long history, I realize that my life is a flash in the pan, a twinkle in the eye, like the lilies of the field, out, out, brief candle.
[00:33:59.157 --> 00:34:04.621]  But that it is the great struggle of the race to uplift ourselves and become nobler
[00:34:05.543 --> 00:34:12.866]  That I am part of and that you are part of and that what matters to me is that we make it to the next level and don't destroy ourselves.
[00:34:12.866 --> 00:34:22.949]  And the greatest crime of the establishment is telling us how bad we are all day, except when the leader comes out, Obama, and then he tells us we're good.
[00:34:22.949 --> 00:34:25.490]  And so we go, oh, he must be good because he's telling us we're good.
[00:34:25.490 --> 00:34:27.090]  I mean, it's disgusting.
[00:34:27.090 --> 00:34:29.111]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[00:34:29.111 --> 00:34:34.413]  And it's like watching a Navy SEAL beat up a newborn baby.
[00:34:36.604 --> 00:34:43.290]  It's like watching an NFL linebacker beat up a one-year-old.
[00:34:43.290 --> 00:34:50.296]  I mean, it's really pathetic that they sit there and abuse these people and then laugh at them.
[00:34:50.296 --> 00:34:53.478]  It's disgusting!
[00:34:53.478 --> 00:34:57.182]  And I personally get to the point up here where
[00:34:58.396 --> 00:35:00.417]  Trying to run this operation, everything we do.
[00:35:00.417 --> 00:35:05.739]  And the way the establishment tries to guilt anyone in new media that tries to fund themselves.
[00:35:05.739 --> 00:35:09.380]  I mean, it's all just mind games manipulating good people.
[00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:10.741]  And it's time to vote with your dollars.
[00:35:10.741 --> 00:35:16.703]  It's time to spread the word about news sites like Infowars.com, Prisonbonnet.com, Fraudreport.com.
[00:35:16.703 --> 00:35:20.064]  It's such a beacon of liberty.
[00:35:20.064 --> 00:35:26.367]  It's time to really get behind the sources that will talk about the real issues that matter and actually put those on the front of the table.
[00:35:27.939 --> 00:35:34.263]  Our ascension is a great responsibility, but it's only happening because great tyranny is rising.
[00:35:34.263 --> 00:35:35.063]  It's a battle.
[00:35:35.063 --> 00:35:35.823]  It's a war.
[00:35:35.823 --> 00:35:38.585]  It's not a bunch of narcissistic baloney.
[00:35:38.585 --> 00:35:39.986]  It is a struggle.
[00:35:40.771 --> 00:35:46.913]  And you will find in that animating struggle of liberty, that animating contest, you will find your humanity.
[00:35:46.913 --> 00:35:47.853]  And I know you know that.
[00:35:47.853 --> 00:35:53.815]  But don't just take our incredible reports for granted that are on PrisonPlanet.tv and the YouTube channel.
[00:35:53.815 --> 00:35:56.696]  Don't just take the news sites and the articles for granted.
[00:35:56.696 --> 00:35:59.116]  I mean, it is hard work to ever get to this point.
[00:35:59.116 --> 00:36:02.437]  A lot of prayers, a lot of providence.
[00:36:02.437 --> 00:36:03.918]  And I'm telling myself that.
[00:36:03.918 --> 00:36:06.378]  I better appreciate the position I'm in.
[00:36:06.378 --> 00:36:08.139]  I better understand that I can't get
[00:36:10.330 --> 00:36:18.579]  I can't get target fatigue, being so close to this, get acclimated to just how big a situation we're in.
[00:36:18.579 --> 00:36:24.225]  And I do, in closing for this hour, before Joel Celente comes up, I haven't plugged all day, we are Lister-supported mainly.
[00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:28.954]  Um, and we sell the best products I can find.
[00:36:28.954 --> 00:36:31.577]  The best water filters at the lowest prices.
[00:36:31.577 --> 00:36:33.919]  The ProPure and others with promo code water.
[00:36:33.919 --> 00:36:36.642]  The best supplements and the best coffee.
[00:36:36.642 --> 00:36:39.045]  Leg of America coffee from Southern Mexico.
[00:36:39.045 --> 00:36:44.331]  Fluoride shield with the nascent iodine and the five other ingredients that can be taken with the survival shield.
[00:36:44.331 --> 00:36:46.012]  But talk to your physician if you have any issues.
[00:36:47.073 --> 00:36:51.734]  Uh, the Life Straws, uh, we got some combos and some specials running.
[00:36:51.734 --> 00:36:54.535]  Infowarslife.com, and it is mid-air refueling.
[00:36:54.535 --> 00:36:56.376]  It is buying your war bonds.
[00:36:56.376 --> 00:37:06.758]  And I know you do it out there, but especially those of you that have wealth and know I'm telling the truth, but kind of got where you are because you have an instinct to be selfish, this is not the time to have that instinct.
[00:37:06.758 --> 00:37:08.379]  That was in the old system before we fell.
[00:37:09.415 --> 00:37:25.612]  We're going into a very dangerous time where if you're not all in, and don't spread the word about this broadcast, and don't become presentplanet.tv members and share memberships, if you don't buy the products at Infowarslife.com, I need a lot more money to be secure, to be strong in the face of the enemy.
[00:37:25.612 --> 00:37:26.953]  I need good armor.
[00:37:26.953 --> 00:37:30.897]  I need good systems to project the truth at the enemy.
[00:37:30.897 --> 00:37:32.359]  I need weapons in the Info War.
[00:37:32.899 --> 00:37:37.710]  I need you to fill our war chest at InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:37:40.518 --> 00:38:04.737]  Your life and how you conduct it, and you don't have to be a big national leader if you just live day-to-day and stay a vigilant citizen, focused on what's happening locally in your local school board, what happens in your local town, and remain active because those are the heroes that make the United States the great country it is, are the everyday citizens that take part.
[00:38:06.463 --> 00:38:28.377]  Alex, we're just lucky that we were the people that seem to have a voice that can be heard, but we really need the millions and millions out there to stand up and finally be counted, because if they don't do that, we're going to lose our great country, and it's not going to be the country that you and I were born in.
[00:38:28.897 --> 00:38:36.971]  It's certainly not the country that I was born in, and the way the direction it's heading for me today, it's not the country that I want to die in.
[00:38:36.971 --> 00:38:40.978]  And I would like to get it back to being the country I would like to die in someday.
[00:38:41.974 --> 00:38:50.837]  Well, that's right, and you've said that if people get behind the national movement to have you run for president, if they get it lined up and show enough interest, then you'll do it, but you can't do everything.
[00:38:50.837 --> 00:38:58.280]  A guy two weeks ago ran into a burning house to get his Xbox, and that same week a guy wouldn't run in his house to get his kids.
[00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:08.104]  And I think about people rioting and burning things and tumping over cars and attacking police in Seattle when the Seahawks won.
[00:39:08.104 --> 00:39:09.485]  You know, I wish people would show
[00:39:10.618 --> 00:39:14.979]  Not that energy for rioting, but that same energy politically for freedom.
[00:39:14.979 --> 00:39:16.380]  What's your take on that, Governor?
[00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:17.160]  I agree.
[00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:19.441]  You know, people need to get more motivated.
[00:39:19.441 --> 00:39:20.601]  Let's remember something.
[00:39:20.601 --> 00:39:23.302]  Football is nothing more than entertainment.
[00:39:23.302 --> 00:39:26.283]  And that's the real problem with our country today.
[00:39:26.283 --> 00:39:33.366]  We have become an entertainment society now, where entertainment is the most important thing in our lives.
[00:39:33.366 --> 00:39:37.727]  And if they look at history, they'll find out that's exactly what happened to the Roman Empire.
[00:39:38.636 --> 00:39:41.698]  Of course, they became enhanced with entertainment.
[00:39:41.698 --> 00:39:43.899]  Entertainment became the main focus.
[00:39:43.899 --> 00:39:51.324]  You know, football's great, sports is terrific, and being entertained is a wonderful thing, but if you break your day up...
[00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:57.301]  We need to get back concentrating on the real things in life, you know.
[00:39:57.301 --> 00:40:01.523]  It used to be you concentrated on working an 8 or 10 hour day.
[00:40:01.523 --> 00:40:03.463]  Today, that's the sideline.
[00:40:03.463 --> 00:40:10.545]  What people focus on today is how do I entertain myself that other 4 to 6 hours when I'm not working and I'm not sleeping.
[00:40:11.138 --> 00:40:19.862]  And we need to take more pride in our work and more pride in being involved in our communities, helping people out.
[00:40:19.862 --> 00:40:30.206]  You know, I often laugh because you hear stories about, you know, I'm an admitted atheist now and you hear stories about, well, atheists, they can't, they don't have
[00:40:30.506 --> 00:40:31.327]  I don't know.
[00:40:47.970 --> 00:40:57.894]  Well, you know, I respect the fact that we agree on about 95% of stuff, but I totally get the fact that the churches are so evil and so hypocritical and are a bunch of Pharisees.
[00:40:57.894 --> 00:41:02.096]  I don't blame people running the opposite direction from these institutions.
[00:41:02.096 --> 00:41:08.958]  And I know you're a moral person who genuinely cares about humanity from a human perspective, and I admire that.
[00:41:08.958 --> 00:41:09.979]  And that's what it's all about.
[00:41:09.979 --> 00:41:15.761]  The people that shake their finger at each other and just want to infight over religion, you know, are the hypocrites.
[00:41:16.281 --> 00:41:21.425]  And if they let a better example out there, you know, people wouldn't see them for the disgusting hypocrites they are.
[00:41:21.425 --> 00:41:24.247]  Now, shifting gears again, you mentioned the drug war.
[00:41:24.247 --> 00:41:28.431]  What a battle with all 14 states trying to decriminalize or legalize marijuana.
[00:41:28.431 --> 00:41:30.652]  Obama doing all the raids.
[00:41:30.652 --> 00:41:32.254]  Whatever happened to states' rights?
[00:41:32.254 --> 00:41:35.116]  Obama claimed he was going to decriminalize marijuana.
[00:41:35.116 --> 00:41:36.057]  Another lie.
[00:41:36.057 --> 00:41:38.659]  Give us your take on what I cut you off about before the break.
[00:41:38.659 --> 00:41:43.282]  And then I want to tie it into this actor who had heroin laced with painkiller.
[00:41:43.282 --> 00:41:44.223]  I can't pronounce this.
[00:41:44.223 --> 00:41:44.824]  How do you say it?
[00:41:45.524 --> 00:41:45.644]  No.
[00:42:06.408 --> 00:42:09.149]  Mike Adams has a great article at naturalnews.com.
[00:42:09.149 --> 00:42:11.030]  It's also on infowars.com.
[00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:16.513]  Overdose death of Hoffman underscores urgent need to decriminalize and regulate recreational drugs.
[00:42:16.513 --> 00:42:31.000]  Northern Europe, five countries there have decriminalized heroin, so you can get medical-grade and controlled dosages, and almost no overdoses are happening now, and drug use has gone down by 50% because you take the black market out of it, everything you've said.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:32.461]  Governor, give us your take on all this.
[00:42:33.101 --> 00:42:34.062]  Absolutely.
[00:42:34.062 --> 00:42:37.184]  You know, it's like my mother said to me.
[00:42:37.184 --> 00:42:50.212]  My mom passed away back in 1995, but she lived through the prohibition of alcohol when they went through that nonsense way back in the 20s and early 30s where they prohibited alcohol.
[00:42:50.212 --> 00:42:56.796]  And my mom's observation was, she told me, she said, the war on drugs is identical to the prohibition of alcohol.
[00:42:56.796 --> 00:42:59.378]  All you're doing is making criminals rich and powerful.
[00:42:59.938 --> 00:43:01.599]  And that's precisely it.
[00:43:01.599 --> 00:43:09.541]  Clearly, some people within our government are profiting greatly from keeping drugs illegal.
[00:43:09.541 --> 00:43:14.782]  By smuggling them in, the prices are then ten times higher than they'd normally be.
[00:43:14.782 --> 00:43:17.603]  I mean, let's look at tobacco and alcohol.
[00:43:17.603 --> 00:43:19.124]  Those two are drugs.
[00:43:19.124 --> 00:43:24.385]  There's no doubt about it, but for some reason they separate them from all the other ones.
[00:43:24.385 --> 00:43:26.466]  Because, number one, they're legal.
[00:43:27.126 --> 00:43:35.392]  Well, tobacco and alcohol causes much damage, or more damage, than all the, quote, illegal drugs do combined.
[00:43:35.392 --> 00:43:41.516]  More people die from alcohol and tobacco every year than what die from any of these other drugs.
[00:43:41.516 --> 00:43:47.720]  In fact, illegal drugs, medical prescription drugs, more people die from those.
[00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:55.045]  Overdoses of drugs you get from your doctor than die from these alleged illegal recreational drugs.
[00:43:55.837 --> 00:44:03.581]  And the point of the matter is, if you live in a free society, drug addiction is a medical problem.
[00:44:03.581 --> 00:44:08.263]  Why we have chose to make it a criminal problem, I have no idea.
[00:44:08.263 --> 00:44:12.505]  Why we somehow think you should take an addict and throw them in prison.
[00:44:13.175 --> 00:44:13.975]  I think so.
[00:44:35.911 --> 00:44:37.292]  We're good to go.
[00:44:57.043 --> 00:45:21.383]  Well, the same thing would hold true if the other drugs are put at a decent price, you put them in hospitals and in pharmacies and places, you don't sell them in 7-Eleven stores, but you put them in places where people can come, admit their addiction, be able to buy what they need, then you at least get a grasp on, okay, now can we wean this person off of the drug?
[00:45:21.383 --> 00:45:23.344]  And I think that in 9 times out of 10,
[00:45:24.085 --> 00:45:26.187]  The addict would go for that.
[00:45:26.187 --> 00:45:30.410]  The addict would go to stop being controlled by this drug.
[00:45:30.410 --> 00:45:33.813]  But the only way that's going to happen is through legalization.
[00:45:33.813 --> 00:45:36.254]  It's not going to happen through prohibition.
[00:45:36.254 --> 00:45:38.156]  And people need to wake up to that fact.
[00:45:39.721 --> 00:45:41.582]  That could be a university dissertation.
[00:45:41.582 --> 00:45:42.483]  I know you taught at Harvard.
[00:45:42.483 --> 00:45:44.884]  That was perfectly said with all the facts.
[00:45:44.884 --> 00:45:51.229]  I mean, look at Prohibition ending, you know, in the early 30s and the police had been corrupted.
[00:45:51.229 --> 00:45:53.170]  Alcoholism had tripled.
[00:45:53.170 --> 00:45:57.853]  Billions had been made by the mafia and corrupt groups and Joe Kennedy.
[00:45:57.853 --> 00:46:09.381]  And so they literally went and lobbied the well-meaning Christian PTAs and people to go all over the country and get drug laws, state and federal passed, where they'd put you in jail for 20 years for a marijuana cigarette.
[00:46:10.421 --> 00:46:19.483]  So that they had something new to deal, and then women need it because it's so expensive, so they become prostitutes, and local government thugs can run that.
[00:46:19.483 --> 00:46:31.305]  I mean, this is all a racket, and everybody knows it, and I don't see how long the drug war can go as the public, all the polls show, want decriminalization across the board, Jesse.
[00:46:31.305 --> 00:46:33.805]  Well, then what you've got to do, Alex, is simple.
[00:46:33.805 --> 00:46:37.046]  You have to start electing people that agree with that position.
[00:46:38.091 --> 00:46:44.636]  I remember when I ran for governor of Minnesota, during the election I brought out, I made a simple statement.
[00:46:44.636 --> 00:46:49.239]  I said, it's time to look at legalizing drugs and prostitution.
[00:46:49.239 --> 00:46:54.543]  Oh my God, the head of the Independence Party of Minnesota went ballistic.
[00:46:54.543 --> 00:46:56.644]  She thought I had blown the whole election.
[00:46:56.644 --> 00:46:59.186]  She goes, oh, we were contending.
[00:46:59.186 --> 00:47:02.108]  Now he opened his mouth on drugs and prostitution.
[00:47:02.108 --> 00:47:04.149]  We're going to lose the election.
[00:47:04.149 --> 00:47:05.010]  It's all lost.
[00:47:05.630 --> 00:47:11.018]  And I'll never forget my partner Dean Barkley, who was instrumental in getting me to run for governor.
[00:47:11.018 --> 00:47:19.171]  Dean walked into the room and sat down and smiled very calmly and says, look, how do we take this lemon and turn it into lemonade?
[00:47:19.913 --> 00:47:23.014]  And he came up with a great idea, and it worked.
[00:47:23.014 --> 00:47:30.977]  He said, we're going to come out here with the position, Jesse Ventura is the only candidate with the courage to talk about these real issues.
[00:47:30.977 --> 00:47:33.097]  Because drug addiction is real.
[00:47:33.097 --> 00:47:35.058]  Prostitution is real.
[00:47:35.058 --> 00:47:40.640]  And he's not afraid to discuss real live situations and what the regular
[00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:48.386]  But I mean exactly, there's women everywhere that you take them out to dinner and you pay their bills, they don't call that prostitution.
[00:47:48.386 --> 00:47:52.909]  And what makes it horrible, and I'm not endorsing it, is the fact that there are pimps.
[00:47:52.909 --> 00:47:54.030]  It is illegal.
[00:47:54.030 --> 00:47:58.554]  These women are being suppressed by it being a black market, and all the studies show that.
[00:47:59.167 --> 00:47:59.988]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:47:59.988 --> 00:48:12.034]  Well, Alex, when you look at prostitution and you strip it all away, okay, in our free society, any sexual act between two consenting adults is legal.
[00:48:12.034 --> 00:48:18.278]  So the only illegality about prostitution, the government's not getting the cut.
[00:48:18.278 --> 00:48:20.459]  They're not paying taxes.
[00:48:20.459 --> 00:48:22.280]  The government wants to be the pimp.
[00:48:22.975 --> 00:48:24.397]  They need their cut.
[00:48:24.397 --> 00:48:28.562]  And so, you know, that's all part of it, to follow the money.
[00:48:28.562 --> 00:48:33.527]  The Sex Act itself is not illegal, so clearly it's the money.
[00:48:33.527 --> 00:48:36.951]  And then you run into a different scenario.
[00:48:36.951 --> 00:48:42.498]  Let's take a pornographic actor, someone who does pornography on TV for money.
[00:48:43.243 --> 00:48:45.384]  Is that not having sex for money?
[00:48:45.384 --> 00:48:47.945]  How is it they're not arrested?
[00:48:47.945 --> 00:48:50.847]  Is that not considered prostitution?
[00:48:50.847 --> 00:48:53.888]  They're having sex, and they're getting paid to do it.
[00:48:53.888 --> 00:48:59.311]  It's just that they're doing it on film, so I guess it's considered an artistic form.
[00:48:59.311 --> 00:48:59.811]  Well said.
[00:48:59.811 --> 00:49:05.113]  Well, I mean, bottom line is... Well, pornography is not illegal, and prostitution is.
[00:49:05.113 --> 00:49:05.894]  How can that be?
[00:49:07.145 --> 00:49:10.348]  Well, I just know all the studies from around the world, it's incontrovertible.
[00:49:10.348 --> 00:49:28.061]  You make something illegal that's a vice, that doesn't hurt non-consenting people, you then make it dark, make it corrupt, make it black market, put tons of money into it, and now the mafia and the corrupt government and the police get to run it.
[00:49:28.061 --> 00:49:32.505]  And that's why they want it illegal, so that they can run it on the dark side, period.
[00:49:32.865 --> 00:49:35.966]  Well, and it's also so that the prices will go up.
[00:49:35.966 --> 00:49:36.807]  That's right.
[00:49:36.807 --> 00:49:39.948]  Anything that's legal, the price drops.
[00:49:39.948 --> 00:49:49.913]  You watch in Colorado and Washington how eventually the price of marijuana is going to drop there where it's legal because there will be competition.
[00:49:50.533 --> 00:49:54.817]  There will be growers of marijuana who will decide, you know what?
[00:49:54.817 --> 00:49:56.778]  I'll undercut the price.
[00:49:56.778 --> 00:50:00.782]  And I'll sell more then because my marijuana will be cheaper.
[00:50:00.782 --> 00:50:05.305]  And that's called good, clean competition in capitalism.
[00:50:05.305 --> 00:50:09.509]  That's what drives prices down, is competition.
[00:50:09.509 --> 00:50:15.594]  And by legalizing marijuana... And then let's look at it from a different standpoint.
[00:50:15.594 --> 00:50:19.117]  For those that think Jesse might be crazy or Alex is crazy.
[00:50:19.797 --> 00:50:31.510]  Marijuana itself is the best that you can get for creating biodiesel fuel and then we can stop using corn and use marijuana and let corn be what it is.
[00:50:31.954 --> 00:50:32.454]  Well, that's right.
[00:50:32.454 --> 00:50:35.615]  Ham grows everywhere as well, and most trains don't even have THC.
[00:50:35.615 --> 00:50:38.636]  Final segment with Jesse Ventura, and we've got the exclusive.
[00:50:38.636 --> 00:50:40.997]  I'll hold him until the next hour after Ventura has to go.
[00:50:40.997 --> 00:50:45.879]  But Jesse, you're going to get a chance to talk to Matthew Mills on the other side.
[00:50:45.879 --> 00:50:49.080]  He's a listener, and we were able to get him on.
[00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:57.443]  The guy that took over the NFL postgame, Super Bowl Sunday, showed us that there basically is no such thing as security.
[00:50:57.443 --> 00:50:58.904]  He's coming up with Jesse Ventura.
[00:51:00.779 --> 00:51:04.282]  From the Berkey Guy, now comes Survival Cave Food Storage.

[00:53:03.777 --> 00:53:17.307]  From 1946 to 1989, during a period known as the Cold War, the enemies of freedom sent teams into their own citizens' homes in order to place listening devices and cameras.
[00:53:17.307 --> 00:53:24.593]  They tracked the movements and personal relationships of anyone they could in order to preserve the power of the state.

[00:54:19.604 --> 00:54:27.508]  No, I always imagined myself making great plays, but you never think about being MVP.
[00:54:27.508 --> 00:54:29.349]  Investigate 9-11.
[00:54:29.349 --> 00:54:31.370]  9-11 was perpetrated by people within our own government.
[00:54:33.473 --> 00:54:40.059]  And just those 15 seconds have now become a sensation all over the news as they attack him, but as it causes the debate.
[00:54:40.059 --> 00:54:43.863]  I'm going to hold him a little bit in the next hour after Governor Jesse Ventura leaves us.
[00:54:43.863 --> 00:54:49.649]  But Jesse, he's a listener, he's been able to get in, and we're going to talk to Matthew Mills.
[00:54:49.649 --> 00:54:50.630]  What do you want to say to him, Governor?
[00:54:51.050 --> 00:54:59.453]  Well, Matthew, I want to say, you know, unbelievable the courage you show and good for you to speak your mind.
[00:54:59.453 --> 00:55:06.776]  I would ask this question of what are they going to do to you or what are they doing to you for what you just did?
[00:55:06.776 --> 00:55:07.776]  Am I on air right now?
[00:55:07.776 --> 00:55:08.477]  Yes, you are.
[00:55:08.477 --> 00:55:10.818]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:55:10.818 --> 00:55:12.158]  I don't think they're going to do much to me.
[00:55:12.158 --> 00:55:14.699]  I only got like a summons, a ticket.
[00:55:14.699 --> 00:55:17.040]  I don't even think it's for that much money.
[00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:18.200]  They grilled me for a while.
[00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:19.681]  They were really, really intense.
[00:55:20.764 --> 00:55:23.186]  It was pretty much everything but the spotlight in my face.
[00:55:23.186 --> 00:55:24.847]  They were real.
[00:55:24.847 --> 00:55:28.709]  The one guy actually said he wanted to punch me in my jaw.
[00:55:28.709 --> 00:55:33.372]  They were kind of mad, but I don't think I'm going to get in any trouble.
[00:55:33.372 --> 00:55:35.253]  Well, that's amazing.
[00:55:35.253 --> 00:55:36.974]  What's been the repercussion for you?
[00:55:36.974 --> 00:55:42.698]  Are there media that want to talk to you, or are they marginalizing you and not talking to you?
[00:55:43.636 --> 00:55:52.422]  Well, I got a bunch of calls yesterday, but I was in the holding cell in the stadium until pretty late at night, until pretty much the stadium closed.
[00:55:52.422 --> 00:55:55.505]  And I had a bunch of texts and calls, and then one guy I finally answered.
[00:55:55.505 --> 00:56:01.909]  It was from NJ.com, and he just asked me some questions, and I was candid with him.
[00:56:01.909 --> 00:56:02.409]  That's right.
[00:56:02.409 --> 00:56:07.413]  You got interviewed by the New Jersey local paper there in the main city.
[00:56:07.413 --> 00:56:11.316]  Listen, can you hold, and after the governor leaves us, I'm going to come back and debrief you on air.
[00:56:13.033 --> 00:56:13.973]  Thank you for calling in.
[00:56:13.973 --> 00:56:15.454]  Our listener taking action.
[00:56:15.454 --> 00:56:19.575]  He's done work with We Are Change in the past as well, and he is one hell of an info warrior.
[00:56:19.575 --> 00:56:22.776]  I tell you, it's great to be part of this family of freedom fighters, Jesse.
[00:56:22.776 --> 00:56:35.881]  Oh, I'll tell you, this kid had courage and guts to do what he did, and that's remarkable, because just those simple words he said, and now the media jumping all over it is bringing it back into the forefront, back to the attention of the
[00:56:36.556 --> 00:56:45.441]  The people throughout the world, which is a good thing, because we've never gotten a resolution on 9-11 just as we've never gotten it on the murder of John Kennedy.
[00:56:45.441 --> 00:56:46.701]  And that's enough of this crap.
[00:56:46.701 --> 00:56:48.042]  We deserve to know the truth.
[00:56:48.042 --> 00:56:50.183]  Oh, by the way, I went to Dallas.
[00:56:50.183 --> 00:56:56.566]  The Dallas police didn't follow the orders of the mayor to have anybody handing out flyers anywhere downtown to be arrested.
[00:56:56.566 --> 00:57:01.609]  So they hired, Homeland Security hired sheriff's deputies to basically punch us and attack us on video.
[00:57:01.609 --> 00:57:05.251]  I don't know if you heard about that, but it was online and made national news.
[00:57:05.871 --> 00:57:08.415]  Well, and all of that because we don't believe the official story.
[00:57:23.356 --> 00:57:25.137]  Well, it's just like they censored your TV show.
[00:57:25.137 --> 00:57:29.239]  It's just like they're afraid of the information, which shows we have power.
[00:57:29.239 --> 00:57:34.342]  I'll tell you, it's amazing that they still try to perpetrate this myth on killing of Kennedy.
[00:57:34.342 --> 00:57:41.405]  I mean, anybody today who believes Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone is completely naive.
[00:57:41.405 --> 00:57:43.226]  There's so much fact out there.
[00:57:43.226 --> 00:57:47.208]  There's so much you can learn about it to know that it's not true.
[00:57:47.208 --> 00:57:50.690]  And I always tell people it's the most important thing because
[00:57:51.371 --> 00:57:54.012]  That's what's led to where we're at today.
[00:57:54.012 --> 00:58:00.054]  And Jack Kennedy lived, I believe we would be living in a different world than what we live in today.
[00:58:00.054 --> 00:58:07.377]  They killed everybody that stood for peace, because obviously there are people in the world that do not want peace, they want war.
[00:58:07.377 --> 00:58:08.597]  And it's that simple, Alex.
[00:58:09.266 --> 00:58:10.487]  Great way to end it.
[00:58:10.487 --> 00:58:14.348]  The TV show is on Aura.tv forward slash Off The Grid.
[00:58:14.348 --> 00:58:16.569]  You can also just Google Jesse Ventura YouTube.
[00:58:16.569 --> 00:58:18.030]  He's got Facebook, all of it.
[00:58:18.030 --> 00:58:20.291]  We have it all linked up on Infowars.com.
[00:58:20.291 --> 00:58:26.874]  Governor, I look forward to seeing you when you're back in the States, and I'll take you up on the invitation to come down and see you in Mexico.
[00:58:26.874 --> 00:58:28.554]  Say hi to your wife and family for me.
[00:58:28.554 --> 00:58:29.375]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:58:29.375 --> 00:58:34.037]  Just when you come down, though, don't bring no drones with you.
[00:58:34.037 --> 00:58:35.417]  We'll see you Off The Grid, Governor.
[00:58:35.417 --> 00:58:35.778]  All right.
[00:58:35.778 --> 00:58:36.298]  Bye-bye.
[00:58:36.298 --> 00:58:36.718]  Take care.
[00:58:36.718 --> 00:58:38.759]  We'll be right back with the man that took over the Super Bowl.
[00:58:41.274 --> 00:58:44.676]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:58:50.681 --> 00:58:55.404]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[00:58:55.404 --> 00:58:58.526]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[00:58:58.526 --> 00:59:04.090]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[00:59:04.090 --> 00:59:05.651]  It all comes down to one thing.
[00:59:05.991 --> 00:59:07.632]  We are what we eat.
[00:59:07.632 --> 00:59:12.315]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[00:59:12.315 --> 00:59:16.517]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and Big Pharma runoff.
[00:59:16.517 --> 00:59:19.098]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[00:59:19.098 --> 00:59:25.322]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[00:59:56.034 --> 00:59:58.815]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:01.209 --> 01:00:06.073]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:06.073 --> 01:00:07.674]  You want answers?
[01:00:07.674 --> 01:00:09.216]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:09.216 --> 01:00:13.399]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:13.399 --> 01:00:17.523]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:27.589 --> 01:00:34.098]  Alright, Joel Skousen, Marine Corps fighter pilot, aviator, from the Vietnam era.
[01:00:34.098 --> 01:00:35.660]  Best-selling author, researcher.
[01:00:35.660 --> 01:00:38.804]  His uncle, of course, Cleon Skousen, wrote The Naked Communist.
[01:00:38.804 --> 01:00:44.632]  Really one of the seminal works exposing how the ultra-rich use communism and socialism as a political tool of slavery.
[01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:48.422]  And of course, he's the editor-in-chief of World Affairs Brief.
[01:00:48.422 --> 01:00:51.044]  You know, four or five days ago, I said, I want to get him on.
[01:00:51.044 --> 01:00:58.430]  And it was about Russia, and it was about the economy, and it was about China threatening to nuke the U.S., and the sellout of our technology.
[01:00:58.430 --> 01:01:00.471]  And I can't even remember why I wanted to get him on now.
[01:01:00.471 --> 01:01:02.713]  I mean, there was one particular reason.
[01:01:02.713 --> 01:01:04.054]  It'll pop in my head in a moment.
[01:01:04.054 --> 01:01:08.738]  But the point is, he can speak to all the stuff that's going on in the world.
[01:01:09.730 --> 01:01:26.663]  And then I can go over the news with him about what's happening in the world, how the entire neocon slash liberal combine wants open borders, what the plan is with that, and where he thinks we are societally.
[01:01:26.663 --> 01:01:34.389]  So again, we have him via Skype and we'll also be going back and forth with phone when his Skype drops.
[01:01:34.389 --> 01:01:36.171]  Joel Skousen, thank you for coming on with us.
[01:01:39.051 --> 01:01:40.572]  Oh, Skype dropped as well.
[01:01:40.572 --> 01:01:45.654]  I tell you, Joel's just awesome, but sometimes he's got technical issues.
[01:01:45.654 --> 01:01:52.156]  But hey, it's the wonder of technology that we can even talk to somebody at a distance.
[01:01:52.156 --> 01:01:54.617]  So that's always good.
[01:01:54.617 --> 01:01:59.799]  I'm sure we want to get the message across to him to be on phone and Skype at the same time.
[01:01:59.799 --> 01:02:00.600]  That's the key.
[01:02:01.660 --> 01:02:06.363]  I'll talk to him during the break, but we'll be discussing that with Joel Skousen.
[01:02:06.363 --> 01:02:08.704]  By the way, I should mention this to everybody.
[01:02:08.704 --> 01:02:17.470]  The subscription side of InfoWars Magazine has been very, very successful, but it's really a tool just to get bulk magazines out, and that was so much more successful.
[01:02:17.470 --> 01:02:20.771]  If you didn't subscribe last month, you will never get a subscription to this.
[01:02:20.771 --> 01:02:21.992]  We're not going to get rid of it in 12 months.
[01:02:21.992 --> 01:02:23.713]  We're going to continue with the bulk making of it.
[01:02:23.713 --> 01:02:24.494]  I love the magazine.
[01:02:24.494 --> 01:02:25.234]  It's very successful.
[01:02:27.113 --> 01:02:37.378]  You know, having 12 shipping, shipping at 12 times, that was like more than half the cost paying for the shipping each time, because you can't get media mail in a newspaper or a magazine.
[01:02:37.378 --> 01:02:46.783]  And so, you know, even at $39.95, 12 issues delivered, it's just so much more inexpensive to sell these in bulk.
[01:02:46.783 --> 01:02:53.087]  I mean, we can ship you 10 of these at cost for a little bit more than it would be to have the subscription each month.
[01:02:54.161 --> 01:02:55.002]  So that's what we're doing.
[01:02:55.002 --> 01:02:55.242]  Get it?
[01:02:55.242 --> 01:02:57.343]  It's a big, glossy, colored magazine.
[01:02:57.343 --> 01:02:58.624]  The February issue is out.
[01:02:58.624 --> 01:03:06.129]  And then you've got a big, double-covered, glossy magazine full of the most important articles of the month and original articles.
[01:03:06.129 --> 01:03:18.118]  This one deals with the heart and soul of the police and the battle by the globalists to turn them into third-world enforcer thugs, and our battle to try to wake them up, how the police can be devils or angels.
[01:03:19.531 --> 01:03:22.093]  And how the globalists are trying to turn them to the dark side.
[01:03:22.093 --> 01:03:27.496]  How we need to fight to take back control of our police from the feds themselves that have been captured by the globalists.
[01:03:27.496 --> 01:03:37.581]  And there's a bunch of other key articles and letters to the editors and so much more in the magazine.
[01:03:37.581 --> 01:03:46.306]  But this is, again, a very important issue dealing with the police throughout it that I'm really, really, really
[01:03:47.281 --> 01:03:47.781]  I don't know.
[01:04:09.270 --> 01:04:09.651]  I don't
[01:04:30.334 --> 01:04:31.775]  Absolutely sure to.
[01:04:31.775 --> 01:04:35.918]  It's America, not America, America at the bald eagle landing there.
[01:04:35.918 --> 01:04:37.259]  This is just pure Americana.
[01:04:37.259 --> 01:04:43.885]  If you show a trendy this, or a socialist this, or a so-called feminist this, we're torturing feminists, fake feminists, since 1995.
[01:04:43.885 --> 01:04:47.107]  This is a sentiment of convulsions of anger.
[01:04:47.107 --> 01:04:49.689]  And there's just so much, so much more.
[01:04:49.689 --> 01:04:51.811]  The Radiation Report, it's all in here.
[01:04:51.811 --> 01:04:53.352]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:05:00.689 --> 01:05:02.590]  Introducing Pro-1.

[01:05:06.233 --> 01:05:10.776]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[01:05:10.776 --> 01:05:16.880]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:27.887]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals all in one filter element.
[01:05:27.887 --> 01:05:30.509]  It is the only one that does it and out of the gate.

[01:05:34.350 --> 01:05:51.674]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands, and sodium hexafluorosilicate.

[01:06:00.416 --> 01:06:03.438]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[01:06:03.438 --> 01:06:08.441]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[01:06:08.441 --> 01:06:15.625]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[01:06:15.765 --> 01:06:21.390]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[01:06:21.390 --> 01:06:25.434]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.
[01:06:25.434 --> 01:06:30.138]  You've got the LifeStraw, so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.
[01:06:30.138 --> 01:06:35.363]  The KTOR Hand Crank Generator, to charge up key equipment during power outages or out in the field.
[01:06:35.603 --> 01:06:38.844]  Strategic Relocation 3rd Edition by Joel Skousen.
[01:06:38.844 --> 01:06:41.345]  When Disaster Strikes by Matthew Stein.
[01:06:41.345 --> 01:06:46.106]  Therosafe used by Homeland Security to protect yourself during any radiological event.
[01:06:46.106 --> 01:06:48.987]  Hand cranked shortwave AM FM radios.
[01:06:48.987 --> 01:06:55.989]  Everything that we've researched and found to be the best is available at InfoWarshop.com and your purchase makes our InfoWar possible.
[01:06:56.189 --> 01:06:57.470]  We're getting prepared.
[01:06:57.470 --> 01:06:58.131]  Are you?
[01:06:58.131 --> 01:07:00.133]  Infowarsshop.com.
[01:07:00.133 --> 01:07:10.825]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[01:07:10.825 --> 01:07:12.667]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[01:07:12.867 --> 01:07:13.747]  Fluoride.
[01:07:13.747 --> 01:07:15.668]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[01:07:15.668 --> 01:07:22.250]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[01:07:22.250 --> 01:07:27.171]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[01:07:27.171 --> 01:07:33.493]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[01:07:33.493 --> 01:07:35.913]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[01:07:35.913 --> 01:07:38.854]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[01:07:38.854 --> 01:07:42.235]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[01:07:42.355 --> 01:07:47.780]  You will find Survival Shield Nascent Iodine exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:07:47.780 --> 01:07:52.885]  InfoWars Life Survival Shield Nascent Iodine isn't just for emergencies.

[01:08:05.305 --> 01:08:10.127]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:08:10.127 --> 01:08:11.728]  You want answers?
[01:08:11.728 --> 01:08:13.268]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:13.268 --> 01:08:17.450]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.450 --> 01:08:21.552]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:26.654 --> 01:08:35.804]  I wanted to get Joel Skousen on last week because I was rereading over the naked communist on Wikipedia that has the goals of communism.
[01:08:37.162 --> 01:08:47.775]  And when a lot of the Soviet archives got declassified in the 90s, indeed these were official communist goals that Klyan Skalzin, his uncle, was able to get.
[01:08:47.775 --> 01:08:56.145]  So I wanted to get him on about this because when you see the Grammys with multiple satanic rituals going on, and I know some of the people involved, they're very serious,
[01:08:57.026 --> 01:09:00.611]  Lady Gaga, all of them, actually believe they're being attacked by demons.
[01:09:00.611 --> 01:09:04.676]  I mean, these people, whether you believe it's real or psychological, it's still an archetype.
[01:09:04.676 --> 01:09:06.919]  They're manifesting this mental illness.
[01:09:06.919 --> 01:09:10.124]  And other authoritarian regimes are always occult-driven.
[01:09:10.124 --> 01:09:13.528]  Hitler was into the occult, the Babylonians, the Egyptians, the Romans.
[01:09:14.594 --> 01:09:16.695]  They serve the same archetype.
[01:09:16.695 --> 01:09:20.178]  Even if we don't believe in God, they are manifesting the same spirit.
[01:09:20.178 --> 01:09:24.161]  So it's real one way or the other, and of course, I know it's spiritual.
[01:09:24.161 --> 01:09:30.665]  Now, we've got his nephew on, who's an author, and of course, former Marine Corps fighter pilot in the Vietnam era.
[01:09:30.665 --> 01:09:32.887]  Heads up, worldaffairsbrief.com.
[01:09:32.887 --> 01:09:37.590]  Joel Skousen, via Skype and phone, in case either one cuts out, you'll hear different
[01:09:38.150 --> 01:09:41.032]  Audio quality back and forth today.
[01:09:41.032 --> 01:09:52.218]  He joins us because I wanted to get him on in the first half of the hour about the communist goals and how mega-rich fund communism and socialism as a tool of control.
[01:09:52.218 --> 01:09:53.739]  Because people get confused by that.
[01:09:53.739 --> 01:09:56.560]  Why does George Soros fund socialism and communism?
[01:09:56.560 --> 01:09:58.961]  Why did the New York banks fund the Bolshevik Revolution?
[01:09:58.961 --> 01:10:05.245]  On record, that was in congressional testimonies and came out in documents in multiple committees.
[01:10:05.245 --> 01:10:06.866]  What are the big foundations up to?
[01:10:07.952 --> 01:10:10.313]  Capture both of the political parties in the United States.
[01:10:10.313 --> 01:10:17.275]  Use technical decisions of the courts to weaken basic American institutions by claiming their activities violate civil laws.
[01:10:17.275 --> 01:10:21.117]  Use fake civil rights to trump basic human rights and God-given rights.
[01:10:21.117 --> 01:10:22.297]  Get control of the schools.
[01:10:22.297 --> 01:10:26.198]  Use them as a transmission belts for socialism and current communist propaganda.
[01:10:26.198 --> 01:10:27.199]  Soften the curriculum.
[01:10:27.819 --> 01:10:31.041]  Use student riots to foment public protest.
[01:10:31.041 --> 01:10:31.962]  Infiltrate the press.
[01:10:31.962 --> 01:10:33.643]  Get control of book reviews.
[01:10:33.643 --> 01:10:36.465]  Continue discrediting American culture.
[01:10:36.465 --> 01:10:37.706]  And now it's been declassified.
[01:10:37.706 --> 01:10:44.731]  The CIA would put out decadent art to then basically then discredit beautiful art.
[01:10:45.922 --> 01:10:56.934]  And again, now you turn on any children's show, any movie, it's meant to sell you on ugliness to where now anything good and pure, it's not enough to accept gays now.
[01:10:56.934 --> 01:10:59.677]  No, no, being straight is bad, we're told in the news.
[01:11:01.883 --> 01:11:03.504]  You see it everywhere.
[01:11:03.504 --> 01:11:06.745]  And again, this is done as the subversion program.
[01:11:06.745 --> 01:11:12.588]  First they want to subvert, then they want to basically undermine the society.
[01:11:12.588 --> 01:11:17.630]  They want to collapse the society and then reorganize it.
[01:11:17.630 --> 01:11:22.372]  So we are literally seeing saboteur operations going on.
[01:11:22.372 --> 01:11:24.473]  And then you understand these are not liberals, folks.
[01:11:24.833 --> 01:11:28.174]  They knew Obamacare would hurt poor people.
[01:11:28.174 --> 01:11:30.035]  They knew it would bankrupt the country.
[01:11:30.035 --> 01:11:31.155]  They want full control.
[01:11:31.155 --> 01:11:32.736]  They hate the masses.
[01:11:32.736 --> 01:11:34.797]  Communists at the top are never really communists.
[01:11:34.797 --> 01:11:38.678]  They are banker technicians conning the unwashed masses.
[01:11:38.678 --> 01:11:45.341]  So I wanted him to break down the program that came out
[01:11:46.704 --> 01:11:49.106]  That they've now discredited the American Founding Fathers.
[01:11:49.106 --> 01:11:50.247]  That's number 30.
[01:11:50.247 --> 01:11:55.092]  Present them as selfish aristocrats who had no concern for the common man when it was the opposite.
[01:11:55.092 --> 01:12:01.478]  They hadn't fully realized these dreams, but they were the first to really put it in paper and move it forward.
[01:12:02.975 --> 01:12:04.917]  And so he joins us now to talk about that.
[01:12:04.917 --> 01:12:21.233]  Then at the bottom of the hour, I want to get into the geopolitical outlook, the economy, the Russians, the Chinese, what's happening in the Middle East, the major buildup for, you know, continued authoritarianism, but the huge awakening we see unfolding with Joel Skousen.
[01:12:21.813 --> 01:12:25.298]  And when I told them I wanted you on a few days ago, I hope they relayed that it was about this.
[01:12:25.298 --> 01:12:27.740]  But I know you're an expert on it, so you can speak to it.
[01:12:27.740 --> 01:12:39.134]  But now, who can deny they're trying to undermine culture and any good institutions so they can collapse them and bring in a total takeover of Joel Skousen?
[01:12:39.134 --> 01:12:39.955]  Well, thanks Alex.
[01:12:39.955 --> 01:12:40.636]  It's good to be with you.
[01:12:41.670 --> 01:12:43.011]  It's good to be with you.
[01:12:43.011 --> 01:12:56.500]  One of the things that I want to point out at the inception here, as I've gone through the 45 goals that Clayton extracted from Communist writings, it's important to realize that you won't find this listed anywhere in Communist literature.
[01:12:56.500 --> 01:13:05.366]  In other words, this was in bits and pieces from various different Communist writers at the time, and actually only about half of them have come true.
[01:13:06.824 --> 01:13:28.089]  And what's most interesting, and you've mentioned some of those, especially, and I might mention, you know, getting UN recognition for Red China, replacing Taiwan was a communist goal, doing away with all loyalty oaths, resisting any attempt to outlaw the Communist Party, all those have been done, Russia continued access to the U.S.
[01:13:28.089 --> 01:13:28.729]  Patent Office.
[01:13:30.632 --> 01:13:35.074]  They did not, however, able to capture both political parties.
[01:13:35.074 --> 01:13:38.095]  That is, for the Communist Party.
[01:13:38.095 --> 01:13:41.776]  They were not able to get control of the schools, per se.
[01:13:41.776 --> 01:13:44.978]  But the schools have been under the control of what we would call globalists.
[01:13:44.978 --> 01:13:58.503]  And this is the most interesting thing about what's happened is that when I look at the list of what they were able to accomplish out of these 45 goals, the half that approximately that were able to be achieved were not achieved by communists.
[01:13:59.554 --> 01:14:11.018]  But they were achieved by non-communists, globalists, and socialists, and leftists and liberals in the United States, who all shared the same, you know, philosophy.
[01:14:11.018 --> 01:14:20.621]  That's the key, is that the Carnegie Endowment and the Ford Endowment, as you know, had helped fund the Bolshevik Revolution and all the rest of it, so it wasn't that they were imitating the communists.
[01:14:21.101 --> 01:14:31.464]  It was that they had been the progenitors of that movement going back even to the 1850s as a way to control rebellions by serfs against one form of slavery.
[01:14:31.464 --> 01:14:33.204]  They were now going to bring in another.
[01:14:33.204 --> 01:14:42.847]  And so the Russians and the KGB and others were actually working for some of the same goals as the Western establishment, as Carol Quigley wrote.
[01:14:42.847 --> 01:14:50.349]  And for example, on the infiltration of the press, I mean, you know, in the 40s there were quite a few communists in the press.
[01:14:51.587 --> 01:15:10.625]  But even some of the major communists that the Whitaker Chamber exposed, like Alger Hiss, turned out to be a globalist who only joined the Communist Party to facilitate bringing them into the State Department and to make the communists feel like they had one of their people at the top levels of the Roosevelt administration and Truman administration.
[01:15:11.266 --> 01:15:14.247]  But in fact, he was a globalist facilitating these things.
[01:15:14.247 --> 01:15:24.288]  And that's what people have to understand, is that this has brought support among anyone who's basically on the receiving end of satanic inspiration.
[01:15:24.288 --> 01:15:33.270]  And it, you know, it includes conspiracies, it includes unthinking liberals, it includes, you know, the gay community.
[01:15:33.270 --> 01:15:38.551]  That's what you're getting at, is there's an energizing spirit throughout history that weaves the same web.
[01:15:39.977 --> 01:15:50.987]  That's right, and you know, I know a lot of people don't believe in God, a lot of people don't believe in Satan, but they're both very, very real, and they both speak to people's minds.
[01:15:50.987 --> 01:16:03.839]  It comes in our own voice, comes in your own grammar, so it sounds like you're talking to yourself, but people know, people recognize when temptation comes in and when good inspiration and good reminders come.
[01:16:04.514 --> 01:16:08.976]  And this is the battle of civilization, the test that's going on in each people's mind.
[01:16:08.976 --> 01:16:10.337]  What voice are we listening to?
[01:16:10.337 --> 01:16:21.122]  And they don't have to be full communists to be listening to a voice that will denigrate culture, denigrate society, and rail against... Even Ayn Rand, who was a libertarian, railed against God.
[01:16:21.122 --> 01:16:22.863]  She hated God.
[01:16:22.863 --> 01:16:29.206]  She hated that voice of conscience, which spoke out against her immorality and her lust and other things.
[01:16:29.206 --> 01:16:33.248]  And other people who get involved in sin have the same problem.
[01:16:34.682 --> 01:16:47.453]  And that's why there is a relationship between bad judgment and sin and the kind of hateful philosophies that end up being created in the minds of men by listening to the wrong sources.
[01:16:47.453 --> 01:16:53.679]  And so it's very interesting that this could be a list equally as useful to globalists
[01:16:54.241 --> 01:16:58.865]  As liberals, as communists, even though they aren't members of the Communist Party.
[01:16:58.865 --> 01:17:14.156]  But in the 90s, it did come out, almost all of these goals, one way or another, were actually being carried out to subvert, but then we learned the CIA, as was declassified last year, was involved trying to put out trash art and trash culture.
[01:17:14.156 --> 01:17:15.858]  Well, that's obvious.
[01:17:15.858 --> 01:17:17.119]  Look what they did at the Grammys.
[01:17:17.799 --> 01:17:23.243]  And now every other public event, they're having open satanic ceremonies and gay marriages.
[01:17:23.243 --> 01:17:25.044]  I mean, there is an agenda there.
[01:17:25.044 --> 01:17:29.688]  I mean, since when is that what America is known for, is satanic ceremonies and gay marriages?
[01:17:30.868 --> 01:17:37.754]  Well, you know, one of the things that you brought to the public attention was the Bohemian Grove and the satanic rituals that are there.
[01:17:37.754 --> 01:17:44.279]  And you have top politicians and leaders in the United States being invited and participating in that.
[01:17:44.279 --> 01:17:53.787]  So it's hard to separate the satanic element that's driving this force and the various superficial organizations that are created.
[01:17:53.787 --> 01:17:58.691]  And there are many of them, whether it's the Bilderberg Group, whether it's the Communist Party, whether it's Fabian Socialism.
[01:17:59.562 --> 01:18:00.583]  Council on Poor and Lazy.
[01:18:00.583 --> 01:18:04.286]  Exactly, and when I was in Bohemian Grove, you know, you could say it was a joke.
[01:18:04.286 --> 01:18:10.471]  A bunch of guys reenacting an ancient Babylonian ritual mixed in with some druidic rituals.
[01:18:10.471 --> 01:18:15.115]  But the old men in the crowd, I talked to said, oh, this is interesting.
[01:18:15.115 --> 01:18:16.536]  And they literally growled at me.
[01:18:16.536 --> 01:18:22.100]  They were in focused, hateful, religious rapture.
[01:18:22.100 --> 01:18:24.923]  And some of them had tears coming out of their eyes, Joel.
[01:18:24.923 --> 01:18:27.285]  I mean, what does that sound like to you?
[01:18:28.806 --> 01:18:30.026]  Well, I can believe that.
[01:18:30.026 --> 01:18:38.369]  But, I mean, these people, we have to remember what drives so many people to get involved in this control system is the promise of immunity.
[01:18:38.369 --> 01:18:44.650]  You know, this is a powerful system that controls courts, it controls congressmen, it controls the president.
[01:18:44.650 --> 01:18:45.651]  Man, you're smart!
[01:18:45.651 --> 01:18:47.851]  The whole ritual was about immunity.
[01:18:47.851 --> 01:18:50.072]  They thought they were getting immunity in that ritual.
[01:18:50.072 --> 01:18:50.932]  That's what they were doing.
[01:18:51.835 --> 01:18:52.955]  Exactly.
[01:18:52.955 --> 01:18:58.857]  In fact, I believe that there's, you know, not only immunity on this earth, and we see that happen all the time.
[01:18:58.857 --> 01:19:03.559]  I mean, Bill Clinton and the President acted as if, hey, nobody can touch me, and he was right.
[01:19:03.559 --> 01:19:08.760]  Nobody could touch him, because he was on the rights, on the, you know, the control side.
[01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:16.843]  But I think in terms of the satanic ritual, I think there's also part of the Faustian pact is the promise of immunity from God's judgment, and
[01:19:17.918 --> 01:19:30.287]  You know, that's what I think Isaiah 14 is all about, when all the rich men and high men of the world are sitting in chains in hell, waiting for Him that was going to thrash the world to come down and save them.
[01:19:30.287 --> 01:19:34.591]  And then they see Him descend in chains, and they say, art thou become one of us.
[01:19:35.248 --> 01:19:39.951]  Meaning, Satan descends and they realize, oh, the immunity pact is broken.
[01:19:39.951 --> 01:19:42.072]  He isn't going to be able to save us.
[01:19:42.072 --> 01:19:44.374]  I think that's what Isaiah was talking about.
[01:19:44.374 --> 01:19:45.334]  Unbelievably powerful.
[01:19:45.334 --> 01:19:46.995]  Let's come back and discuss that.
[01:19:46.995 --> 01:19:49.597]  I bring up communism, he brings up the devil.
[01:19:49.597 --> 01:19:52.258]  Because Lenin said he worshipped the devil.
[01:19:52.258 --> 01:19:54.400]  I mean, that's what is at the bottom of the rabbit hole, folks.
[01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:59.623]  Whether you believe in the devil or not, these people believe in him, they worship him, and they are given power by him.

[01:22:03.905 --> 01:22:15.572]  From 1946 to 1989, during a period known as the Cold War, the enemies of freedom sent their own citizens' homes in order to place listening devices and cameras.
[01:22:17.412 --> 01:22:24.702]  They tracked the movements and personal relationships of anyone they could in order to preserve the power of the state.

[01:23:50.806 --> 01:23:51.868]  For the love of clean water.
[01:24:32.919 --> 01:24:37.561]  Alright, Joel Scalza, this is a short segment, long segment coming up to get into geopolitics.
[01:24:37.561 --> 01:24:42.204]  Everyone that I know has a serious feeling in their gut of concern.
[01:24:42.204 --> 01:24:42.985]  It's increasing.
[01:24:42.985 --> 01:24:44.926]  I've never had so much concern.
[01:24:44.926 --> 01:24:47.207]  And I think of the globalists, what fools they are.
[01:24:47.207 --> 01:24:50.689]  I instinctively, at a spiritual level,
[01:24:52.210 --> 01:25:03.076]  Know that the big sin is leading people astray, trying to get people into evil, trying to take advantage of childlike minds, as Christ said, suffer the little children.
[01:25:03.076 --> 01:25:07.199]  We're not just talking about children, we're talking about young people, folks that are looking up to you.
[01:25:08.485 --> 01:25:10.767]  And you talk about God-fearing.
[01:25:10.767 --> 01:25:12.849]  I just feel it in my spirit.
[01:25:12.849 --> 01:25:15.611]  If something's bad, I don't even want to do it.
[01:25:15.611 --> 01:25:20.675]  Thinking about it, even to study it, makes me have fear of separation from God.
[01:25:20.675 --> 01:25:28.180]  Not that I'm some great goody two-shoe or anything, but I don't do conscious evil, and I have a drive to stand up against evil, and that's why I don't have fear of it.
[01:25:28.180 --> 01:25:29.522]  I have fear of letting it take over.
[01:25:30.282 --> 01:25:33.004]  But I think about what fools the worldly are.
[01:25:33.004 --> 01:25:55.477]  They either hate God because they feel the judgment, even though they say God isn't real, or they do, literally at Bohemian Grove, conduct all these rituals and say to absolve them from the care and what they've done in the last year, and they take it very seriously, as if some satanic ritual is going to get them out of what they've done.
[01:25:55.477 --> 01:25:56.918]  I mean, even in the real world,
[01:25:58.250 --> 01:26:01.453]  When they allow radiation out of Fukushima, it hits their kids and them as well.
[01:26:01.453 --> 01:26:05.937]  I mean, they may get a few get-out-of-jail-free cards, but this is the height of delusion.
[01:26:05.937 --> 01:26:10.821]  But you're right, it's the heart of the world is about escaping judgment.
[01:26:10.821 --> 01:26:14.164]  But that just seems so mindless.
[01:26:14.164 --> 01:26:18.608]  I mean, a five-year-old should know you can't escape judgment forever.
[01:26:18.608 --> 01:26:22.552]  We have to remember that these people have a great motivation to escape judgment.
[01:26:22.552 --> 01:26:23.693]  They've got a mountain of sin.
[01:26:24.562 --> 01:26:28.183]  And they've got a mountain of evil intent as well.
[01:26:28.183 --> 01:26:32.925]  And what keeps them going is the fact that someone is promising immunity.
[01:26:32.925 --> 01:26:40.168]  And they really do act as if... I mean, let me point out, from another point of view, I often get this question.
[01:26:40.168 --> 01:26:50.272]  How is it that the globalists, the most wealthy men in the world, with all the ownership of factories and major inroads into big corporations, why would they bring upon the nation
[01:26:51.112 --> 01:26:51.212]  Yes.
[01:27:11.016 --> 01:27:17.941]  Looking out for his best interest would do that if someone more powerful than him had said, you do what I say and I grant you immunity.
[01:27:17.941 --> 01:27:19.782]  You will come out unscathed.
[01:27:19.782 --> 01:27:22.504]  Now, he won't be able to fulfill those promises.
[01:27:22.504 --> 01:27:30.149]  But that's the only thing that gets smart, able people to go along with an agenda that does threaten their existence.
[01:27:30.149 --> 01:27:31.670]  They've been promised immunity.
[01:27:31.670 --> 01:27:33.711]  They've been promised that they'll escape.
[01:27:33.711 --> 01:27:40.596]  Now, that's one of the reasons why people in our government, even retired CIA, DEA, FBI, they built
[01:27:41.329 --> 01:27:46.831]  Major bunker safe room systems in homes in Colorado, Utah, and other safe places.
[01:27:46.831 --> 01:27:48.772]  I mean, these people are not dumb.
[01:27:48.772 --> 01:27:52.793]  They know what's coming, and they are preparing to defend themselves.
[01:27:52.793 --> 01:27:58.195]  The government, of course, and its continuity of government program has huge new underground bunkers.
[01:27:58.195 --> 01:28:03.977]  A major system in the West Utah desert to replace Cheyenne Mountain, which they know is a known target.
[01:28:03.977 --> 01:28:10.759]  They've been doing a lot of secret bunker systems because they know the Soviets and the Chinese know where the original ones were, and they want protection.
[01:28:12.268 --> 01:28:17.351]  But as I say, ultimately, Christ is going to have the last say.
[01:28:17.351 --> 01:28:26.939]  His second coming, I believe, comes because Satan has near total control over the entire world, except for a remnant of good people which won't be allowed to be destroyed.
[01:28:26.939 --> 01:28:33.984]  I mean, we've got a real battle royal on our hands, Alex, and you're doing a great job in terms of alerting people to what's
[01:28:34.580 --> 01:28:46.088]  What's coming, but the big thing is, people need to know, it's not necessarily economic collapse that's the major problem, it is this war with Russia and China, and they are both building for it.
[01:28:46.088 --> 01:28:54.954]  And we are disarming, proposing in the next few months another disarmament treaty with Russia, even though they have been violating every single one.
[01:28:56.008 --> 01:28:58.029]  Can you imagine the irony of that?
[01:28:58.029 --> 01:29:06.752]  Is that we have three nuclear powers, major nuclear powers, and we're negotiating with one, disarming as if the third, China, doesn't make any difference.
[01:29:06.752 --> 01:29:08.473]  I mean, talk about a fool's paradise.
[01:29:08.473 --> 01:29:21.478]  You know that's not feigned disarmament when you aren't even suggesting a disarmament treaty with the third, which is going to slowly outstrip even Russia in terms of ability to put nuclear throw away.
[01:29:22.734 --> 01:29:23.174]  Stay there.
[01:29:23.174 --> 01:29:37.578]  I want to cover the waterfront with what's happening on the planet right now with the economy, Obama, the attempt by the neocons to completely destroy the Republican Party so there's no opposition, the open borders, and a lot of other breaking news with Joel Skousen.
[01:29:37.578 --> 01:29:41.559]  I'm Alex Jones with InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:29:41.559 --> 01:29:44.000]  His site's WorldAffairsBrief.com.
[01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.500]  We'll be right back on the other side.
[01:29:46.500 --> 01:29:47.961]  Tell your friends and family to tune in.
[01:29:50.185 --> 01:29:54.108]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.108 --> 01:29:56.790]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.976 --> 01:30:10.061]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:30:10.061 --> 01:30:18.465]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:30:18.465 --> 01:30:23.348]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:30:23.348 --> 01:30:29.491]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowars Live
[01:30:30.131 --> 01:30:37.297]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:30:37.297 --> 01:30:44.342]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:30:44.342 --> 01:30:48.826]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[01:30:48.826 --> 01:30:52.028]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[01:30:52.188 --> 01:30:58.492]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[01:30:58.492 --> 01:31:00.974]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[01:31:00.974 --> 01:31:02.014]  The facts are in.
[01:31:02.014 --> 01:31:03.415]  The studies are legion.
[01:31:03.415 --> 01:31:10.940]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[01:31:10.940 --> 01:31:14.763]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[01:31:14.763 --> 01:31:15.323]  Simple.
[01:31:15.323 --> 01:31:19.686]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[01:31:20.026 --> 01:31:25.749]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[01:31:25.749 --> 01:31:42.098]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield Formulation, fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[01:31:42.098 --> 01:31:43.919]  Let's take a stand against the globalists.
[01:31:44.059 --> 01:31:46.641]  By blocking their poisons with Fluoride Shield.
[01:31:46.641 --> 01:31:48.823]  I use Fluoride Shield everyday.

[01:32:00.934 --> 01:32:03.777]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:32:03.777 --> 01:32:08.921]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[01:32:08.921 --> 01:32:17.028]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:32:17.028 --> 01:32:21.572]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[01:32:21.572 --> 01:32:25.375]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:32:25.515 --> 01:32:31.462]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:32:31.462 --> 01:32:34.645]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:32:34.645 --> 01:32:39.791]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from my Patriot Supply.

[01:33:05.140 --> 01:33:09.221]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:33:09.221 --> 01:33:12.002]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:12.002 --> 01:33:15.682]  You can run on for a long time.
[01:33:15.682 --> 01:33:18.623]  Run on for a long time.
[01:33:18.623 --> 01:33:21.484]  Run on for a long time.
[01:33:21.484 --> 01:33:24.464]  Sooner or later gotta cut you down.
[01:33:24.464 --> 01:33:26.885]  Sooner or later gotta cut you down.
[01:33:29.545 --> 01:33:40.771]  Alright, I want to throw out a whole bunch of topics at Joel Skousen of World Affairs Brief to get his take on them.
[01:33:40.771 --> 01:33:44.593]  First off, how are things going for Obama, in your view?
[01:33:44.593 --> 01:33:53.097]  They're trying to put autocratic elected presidents, but also appointed Goldman Sachs dictators over places like Italy and Greece.
[01:33:54.190 --> 01:33:58.353]  Obama is openly taking on dictatorial powers more and more.
[01:33:58.353 --> 01:34:02.836]  The Republican leadership's not even really criticizing it, or they are mildly.
[01:34:02.836 --> 01:34:07.800]  Obviously, we know that's part of a longer precedent to concentrate power.
[01:34:07.800 --> 01:34:13.544]  But Obamacare was designed, as we know, to implode healthcare, but it's extremely unpopular.
[01:34:13.544 --> 01:34:14.625]  But they don't seem to care.
[01:34:14.625 --> 01:34:20.749]  They just go forward with every program, even if it's unpopular, like they're trying to catch up.
[01:34:20.749 --> 01:34:22.390]  What's going on domestically?
[01:34:23.291 --> 01:34:26.833]  Well, first of all, the State of the Union address by Obama was very telling.
[01:34:26.833 --> 01:34:29.174]  The biggest thing that he announced really was a minimum wage increase to $10.10.
[01:34:44.258 --> 01:34:46.460]  And everything else was downplayed.
[01:34:46.460 --> 01:34:57.491]  Now, this is very telling, Alex, because it means instead of broadcasting what his agenda is going to be in the next year, he was downplaying it.
[01:34:57.491 --> 01:35:00.233]  Oh, he mentioned amnesty and that we need to pass it.
[01:35:00.233 --> 01:35:02.335]  He mentioned disarmament.
[01:35:02.335 --> 01:35:04.097]  He mentioned some of these other things.
[01:35:04.617 --> 01:35:07.440]  But we're eager to come out and make a major presentation.
[01:35:07.440 --> 01:35:12.905]  We're going to have this, I'm presenting this amnesty bill and I'm presenting this major stuff.
[01:35:12.905 --> 01:35:16.669]  There is a crescendo, a wave of opposition to Obama.
[01:35:17.586 --> 01:35:28.770]  And I feel that the downplaying of these issues in the State of the Union was specifically meant not to raise up the opposition, not to get everything stirred up.
[01:35:28.770 --> 01:35:37.713]  They want to slip these in either through executive orders or through, you know, their compromised Republicans, like John Boehner, getting him to go.
[01:35:37.713 --> 01:35:40.034]  He's preparing to go along with the amnesty.
[01:35:40.034 --> 01:35:42.015]  So that's how I view the Obama administration.
[01:35:42.015 --> 01:35:44.295]  They're very much aware he's under fire.
[01:35:44.295 --> 01:35:45.656]  He's very unpopular.
[01:35:46.517 --> 01:35:54.965]  And that's why, as I mentioned in today's World Affairs Brief, he threw a bone to Marco Rubio, Senator Rubio.
[01:35:54.965 --> 01:36:03.413]  It's very rare that a Democratic president would say something positive about a Republican that's going to run against Hillary Clinton in the next election.
[01:36:03.413 --> 01:36:03.913]  But he did.
[01:36:03.913 --> 01:36:08.037]  And that can only mean, number one, that they're
[01:36:08.763 --> 01:36:17.809]  The typical corrupt politician, Chris Christie, that they wanted to throw at conservatives, he was just like Rudolph Giuliani in 2008, wasn't going to fly with conservatives.
[01:36:17.809 --> 01:36:19.370]  Neither is Chris Christie.
[01:36:19.370 --> 01:36:28.796]  And so he threw a bone, threw a major kudu to Senator Rubio, and that means he's the backup man the establishment's going to promote, probably, for president.
[01:36:29.389 --> 01:36:40.076]  There's several others in the offing, but that was the telling incident, and it shows the establishment is probably going to allow the Republicans to have a controlled president.
[01:36:40.076 --> 01:36:56.387]  They get certain things done under a radical Democrat like Obama, and they get certain things done under a person, a controlled Republican like George W. Bush, and they'll have, I guarantee you, a very controlled Republican in 2016 for us.
[01:36:56.387 --> 01:36:58.409]  Now, in terms of the economy,
[01:36:59.082 --> 01:37:01.823]  The economy is still struggling.
[01:37:01.823 --> 01:37:07.964]  A lot of figures are down, only a few figures are up, and a lot of those are manipulated.
[01:37:07.964 --> 01:37:15.906]  But there is a comeback coming in the housing market, mostly because demand is so high.
[01:37:15.906 --> 01:37:16.906]  Rentals are hot.
[01:37:16.906 --> 01:37:18.747]  They're running out of rentals.
[01:37:18.747 --> 01:37:23.088]  All of the millions of people that are coming online, getting married, joining the workforce, have no place.
[01:37:24.102 --> 01:37:26.043]  They're pushing a rental market.
[01:37:26.043 --> 01:37:29.765]  There is going to be a continued rise in the housing market.
[01:37:29.765 --> 01:37:39.951]  It won't be a major bubble, in my opinion, but it looks like they're trying their best to inflate in a moderate way in order to keep this thing going.
[01:37:39.951 --> 01:37:51.057]  One of the things I want to say, though, about the economy is that, you know, this recession that we're still in, they're calling it a recovery, but we're still in a recession, and this really is what's real, Alex.
[01:37:51.681 --> 01:37:55.305]  This is where people ought to get used to the level of business.
[01:37:55.305 --> 01:38:01.972]  Walmart's got to get used to lower sales because that reflects what people are still selling enough to make a profit.
[01:38:01.972 --> 01:38:07.158]  Nobody's going bankrupt in this thing, but they are having to get used to lower sales.
[01:38:07.158 --> 01:38:08.480]  And so rather than call it
[01:38:09.139 --> 01:38:17.386]  A depression or a recovery, what it really is, is a stagnant economy that is sorting out over time.
[01:38:17.386 --> 01:38:26.112]  The longer you allow it to go over time without collapsing, the more it tends to sort itself out.
[01:38:26.112 --> 01:38:27.373]  I am of the strong belief
[01:38:29.401 --> 01:38:30.442]  We're good to go.
[01:38:46.638 --> 01:39:02.148]  Sure, what they're doing is they're pumping up their controlled economy while regulating out of existence all of their economy systems they don't control.
[01:39:02.148 --> 01:39:04.310]  They're consolidating things right now.
[01:39:05.697 --> 01:39:11.741]  Well, it is true that most of the new money that is created, first of all, goes through the speculative economy.
[01:39:11.741 --> 01:39:15.664]  It goes through the major banks that control the Federal Reserve, the J.P.
[01:39:15.664 --> 01:39:24.390]  Morgan Chase's and the Goldman Sachs, gets into the stock market, and that's why the stock market is due for a major correction.
[01:39:24.390 --> 01:39:30.994]  I think it could come down in this year as much as 20%, but that won't collapse the economy.
[01:39:30.994 --> 01:39:33.916]  Economies really don't collapse unless war comes along.
[01:39:34.580 --> 01:39:42.185]  They do go down, there are depressions, but all of those things are caused by pulling the money supply, just like the depression of 1929-30.
[01:39:42.185 --> 01:39:49.830]  And they're not showing any signs right now of pulling the money supply, they're showing all the signs of continuing to bail things out.
[01:39:49.830 --> 01:39:52.252]  Now, I'm not predicting that things are good.
[01:39:52.252 --> 01:39:52.832]  They aren't good.
[01:39:53.656 --> 01:39:59.599]  Uh, but I see every sign that the powers that be don't want to pull the plug, don't want to cause trouble.
[01:39:59.599 --> 01:40:06.343]  Sure, they want a long cold depression against everybody but the sectors and combines they control.
[01:40:06.343 --> 01:40:07.964]  Let's expand out from that point.
[01:40:08.484 --> 01:40:14.790]  What do you make of the reports by the head of Saudi intelligence four months ago that he would launch al-Qaeda attacks inside Russia?
[01:40:14.790 --> 01:40:16.472]  We now see those unfolding.
[01:40:16.472 --> 01:40:22.057]  Do those look like those are real terror attacks, meaning to destabilize the Olympics for Russia helping Syria?
[01:40:22.057 --> 01:40:23.819]  I see a motive there.
[01:40:23.819 --> 01:40:26.982]  Or does Putin have any type of motive for a false flag?
[01:40:31.475 --> 01:40:36.399]  It's complex and hard to answer, Alex, because there's a lot that we can't prove.
[01:40:36.399 --> 01:40:40.081]  There have been reports of the Saudis threatening Putin.
[01:40:40.081 --> 01:40:41.902]  I personally don't believe it.
[01:40:41.902 --> 01:40:51.669]  I don't believe Saudi Arabia would ever get in the position of threatening Russia, who could squash them like a bug, if they wanted to.
[01:40:51.669 --> 01:40:56.012]  There is legitimate... As I pointed out in a couple of World Affairs Briefs back,
[01:40:56.707 --> 01:40:57.448]  The U.S.
[01:40:57.448 --> 01:41:06.816]  and Russia have both used false flag terrorism to gin up the war against terror so that they can use that to clamp down on opposition.
[01:41:06.816 --> 01:41:09.018]  But in doing so, both the U.S.
[01:41:09.018 --> 01:41:19.948]  and Russia have created real terror in response to their occupation, in response to their using false flag terror to justify clamping down on peoples.
[01:41:19.948 --> 01:41:22.210]  They have produced real terror.
[01:41:23.524 --> 01:41:31.967]  In my estimation, there is real terror that happened in Bolidov Grodd, which is about 100 kilometers from Sochi.
[01:41:31.967 --> 01:41:38.349]  I'll tell you, the reports I've got from Sochi is that the KGB and the Secret Service of Russia is out in force.
[01:41:38.349 --> 01:41:42.871]  They've got anti-missile batteries on their camouflage nets.
[01:41:42.871 --> 01:41:45.352]  They have got hundreds and hundreds
[01:41:45.902 --> 01:41:46.202]  I don't know.
[01:41:59.460 --> 01:42:09.227]  But I'm frankly not buying the rumor or the propaganda that the Saudis are trying to take out or take on Russia directly.
[01:42:09.227 --> 01:42:13.831]  Well, regardless, we know that the globalists have been funding radical Islam in that area.
[01:42:13.831 --> 01:42:18.474]  And so why are the radical Islamists activating ahead of the Olympics?
[01:42:18.474 --> 01:42:21.636]  Do you think the West is behind that?
[01:42:21.636 --> 01:42:23.137]  Well, not really.
[01:42:23.137 --> 01:42:24.939]  You've got to remember that the West is
[01:42:25.885 --> 01:42:31.106]  is really supporting Russia and has been for many years.
[01:42:31.106 --> 01:42:37.588]  They do antagonize Russia to give Russia the excuse to go before their people and say, you know, the U.S.
[01:42:37.588 --> 01:42:39.968]  is meddling in our elections and other things.
[01:42:39.968 --> 01:42:40.528]  And the U.S.
[01:42:40.528 --> 01:42:42.729]  could do that covertly in a very smart way.
[01:42:42.729 --> 01:42:51.071]  They do it in kind of an obtuse way so that they can get caught, so that Putin can have the excuse to go before the people and build anti-American sentiment.
[01:42:51.071 --> 01:42:51.971]  And that's what he's doing.
[01:42:52.791 --> 01:42:53.812]  And vice versa.
[01:42:53.812 --> 01:42:54.872]  What about Ukraine?
[01:42:54.872 --> 01:42:58.033]  I mean, is that because they wouldn't join the EU?
[01:42:58.033 --> 01:42:59.714]  This is a big issue, Alex.
[01:42:59.714 --> 01:43:02.315]  The Ukraine is going to be an ongoing thing.
[01:43:02.315 --> 01:43:09.498]  Now, Gorbachev came out and asked Putin to intervene militarily in the Ukraine, and suggested he do so.
[01:43:09.498 --> 01:43:15.920]  Putin visited the Ukraine, said no military intervention, but he did want to set down the guidelines.
[01:43:15.920 --> 01:43:17.101]  Here's what I think is happening.
[01:43:17.601 --> 01:43:38.209]  Just like Hitler used attacks on Germans in the Sudetenland and Poland to justify an eventual invasion, Russia has put millions of Russians, immigrants, into Ukraine, into Georgia, into Belarus, into the Baltic states, and they're still there today, as a minority.
[01:43:38.209 --> 01:43:41.370]  It would be very easy to get those people to, you know,
[01:43:41.971 --> 01:43:47.735]  They're going to have an attack mentality or get a false flag attack on them to justify Russian troop intervention.
[01:43:47.735 --> 01:43:49.336]  It's too early for that, however.
[01:43:49.336 --> 01:43:53.939]  And I don't think that Russia wants to move too soon.
[01:43:53.939 --> 01:43:57.881]  They're not ready to take on the United States in a major third world war.
[01:43:57.881 --> 01:44:05.326]  That's why I don't think they're going to end up supporting Syria or Iran if they go down, just like they let Iraq go down.
[01:44:06.016 --> 01:44:17.799]  In other words, all of the major new weapon systems that both Russia and China are putting online are not supposed to come online or be operational until at least 2020.
[01:44:17.799 --> 01:44:28.281]  So this is clearly too early to be creating a false flag excuse to go in militarily into Ukraine.
[01:44:28.281 --> 01:44:28.941]  That said,
[01:44:29.907 --> 01:44:45.833]  It's my analysis that this is going to be a festering thing that's going to go on for several years and will build into a crescendo that will spread into Georgia and Belarus and other countries that will eventually justify a Russian intervention.
[01:44:45.833 --> 01:44:54.656]  In the same sense, over in the Far East, China is really getting some hot rhetoric at the Davos International Economic Conference.
[01:44:54.656 --> 01:44:58.898]  They really went head-to-head with Japanese Prime Minister Abe
[01:44:59.822 --> 01:45:02.085]  And, uh, you know, threats and counter-threats.
[01:45:02.085 --> 01:45:06.350]  And the trouble is, the Eastern mentality is one of saving face.
[01:45:06.350 --> 01:45:09.574]  And they get up there and pound the pulpit and make threats to one another.
[01:45:09.574 --> 01:45:14.641]  And it's very difficult for Orientals to back down and save face, especially the Chinese.
[01:45:15.672 --> 01:45:19.354]  Nevertheless, they too aren't ready to take on the world.
[01:45:19.354 --> 01:45:21.675]  We are going to see them continue to test the waters.
[01:45:21.675 --> 01:45:28.419]  But you agree that at any time with China saying they might invade and take Philippine islands, they might take Japanese disputed islands.
[01:45:28.419 --> 01:45:31.200]  I mean, if that happens, if Japan or the U.S.
[01:45:31.200 --> 01:45:34.082]  doesn't stand down, it will be a confrontation.
[01:45:34.082 --> 01:45:36.963]  Or is China really that willing to saber-rattle?
[01:45:36.963 --> 01:45:44.347]  Because, you know, as you said, the whole Asian cultural, historical, military mindset, they don't usually threaten something unless they're
[01:45:44.747 --> 01:45:46.570]  Planning to carry it out, right?
[01:45:46.570 --> 01:45:47.332]  That's right.
[01:45:47.332 --> 01:45:50.197]  And as I say, they don't want to lose face.
[01:45:50.197 --> 01:45:55.947]  And I think they're going to test the waters by taking control militarily of some of these islands.
[01:45:55.947 --> 01:45:56.809]  And I think the U.S.
[01:45:56.809 --> 01:45:58.031]  is going to let them get away with it.
[01:45:58.934 --> 01:46:01.957]  And I think that's going to be a big sign to China.
[01:46:01.957 --> 01:46:03.418]  Yep, we're on a roll.
[01:46:03.418 --> 01:46:05.920]  Just like we did with the Japanese in the 30s.
[01:46:05.920 --> 01:46:06.700]  Exactly.
[01:46:06.700 --> 01:46:07.601]  We let them get away.
[01:46:07.601 --> 01:46:08.982]  We let them invade China.
[01:46:08.982 --> 01:46:10.524]  We didn't stop them.
[01:46:10.524 --> 01:46:15.388]  And it only gave them more, you know, enthusiasm for the fight.
[01:46:15.388 --> 01:46:17.049]  And so I think that's what you're going to see.
[01:46:17.049 --> 01:46:21.633]  I think you're going to see them take the Philippine islands first, or they might take the ones down by
[01:46:22.760 --> 01:46:35.670]  Uh, Vietnam, uh, which are disputed as well, uh, they'll probably leave the Senkakus to last because Japan does have a fairly formidable, uh, defense force that could put up, uh, a fight.
[01:46:35.670 --> 01:46:39.993]  But I think you're going to see a little domino effect going on here and you're going to see the, the U.S.
[01:46:39.993 --> 01:46:44.076]  show its, uh, conciliatory paper tiger, uh, nature.
[01:46:44.076 --> 01:46:51.301]  And we know what they're up to, the globalists like, uh, Admiral Locklear, uh, in charge of, uh, Sin Compact, uh,
[01:46:52.390 --> 01:46:56.492]  It's clearly out to pacify the Chinese.
[01:46:56.492 --> 01:46:57.352]  They know it.
[01:46:57.352 --> 01:47:02.954]  The Obama administration put him in that position to pacify, and it's going to create war someday.
[01:47:02.954 --> 01:47:09.017]  These people are playing soft in order to, you know, invite this attack.
[01:47:09.017 --> 01:47:13.679]  China and Russia know that the West is a formidable enemy, and that's why they're
[01:47:14.304 --> 01:47:14.925]  We're good to go.
[01:47:33.261 --> 01:47:35.122]  They're actually in construction.
[01:47:35.122 --> 01:47:36.682]  The keels are being laid.
[01:47:36.682 --> 01:47:44.824]  They're not supposed to, according to a report six months ago, be ready and operational until 2022 to 2024.
[01:47:44.824 --> 01:47:48.385]  And the latest report coming out, the Chinese said they want them operational by 2020.
[01:47:48.385 --> 01:47:53.946]  That indicates that they're accelerating their timeline or attempting to.
[01:47:55.017 --> 01:48:04.572]  And as I pointed out in my World Affairs Brief last week, the closer they get to operational readiness for war with the West, the easier it is for them to go early
[01:48:06.471 --> 01:48:09.613]  By taking advantage of an opportunity that may present itself.
[01:48:37.472 --> 01:48:39.834]  We are, but only after I think we absorb a nuclear first strike.
[01:48:39.834 --> 01:48:41.975]  Here's how I think it's going to come down, Alex.
[01:48:54.994 --> 01:48:56.735]  It has to be North Korea.
[01:48:56.735 --> 01:49:03.338]  North Korea is the most rogue element in the world, and yet it's being given a pass by the U.S.
[01:49:03.338 --> 01:49:07.860]  We don't do anything to stop its nuclear progress, unlike Iran.
[01:49:07.860 --> 01:49:12.602]  And Iran is being set up, by the way, for failure of this current agreement so that the U.S.
[01:49:12.602 --> 01:49:14.323]  can attack.
[01:49:14.323 --> 01:49:20.386]  That was put out in a Brookings Institution piece in 2009, where they said, you know what the U.S.
[01:49:20.386 --> 01:49:23.267]  needs to do is bend the world backwards and give them a peace deal.
[01:49:23.687 --> 01:49:30.631]  Have them violate it so that it appears as if we didn't want this war, but Iran really slapped us in the face over this.
[01:49:30.631 --> 01:49:33.293]  I think that's what Iran's being set up for.
[01:49:33.293 --> 01:49:42.139]  That will not turn into World War III, because Russia and China, it's too early, they aren't ready to go to World War III over Iran.
[01:49:42.139 --> 01:49:50.744]  That will be done to consolidate Israel's hegemony over the Middle East, and the hatred of both the US and Israel will increase dramatically, which feeds
[01:49:51.471 --> 01:49:55.253]  The excuse that Russia and China need eventually to take down the bully of the world.
[01:49:55.253 --> 01:49:58.255]  But the trigger event, I believe, will be North Korea.
[01:49:58.255 --> 01:50:12.202]  When you see a North Korean launch against the South, and they have, they do some minor military attack every year, so you've got to be careful not to confuse those with the major artillery barrage on Seoul.
[01:50:12.202 --> 01:50:15.984]  If that ever starts, you know you're days away from nuclear war.
[01:50:15.984 --> 01:50:17.425]  People ought to get out of the cities.
[01:50:18.348 --> 01:50:22.649]  There are major nuclear targets like Seattle, Washington, D.C.
[01:50:22.649 --> 01:50:45.953]  When we come back, tell us how the war games, it's not just your analysis, this is what a lot of the big think tanks admit, that's why the main force is to Asia, how it will play out within two days, how big the nuclear attack will be, and of course the film, Strategic Relocation, that we produced together, I should add, is available exclusively at InfowarsStore.com on DVD for your archives, or you can be seen at PrisonPlanet.tv, and then the big color book,
[01:50:46.973 --> 01:50:53.898]  There's no other research out there like it outside of government systems that nobody has access to.

[01:53:51.935 --> 01:53:52.996]  Life's getting better!
[01:54:11.589 --> 01:54:25.338]  David Knight's coming up in the next hour in studio with breaking NSA news that's really bombshell.
[01:54:25.338 --> 01:54:31.922]  I mean, we already knew it was happening, but it gives you an idea of the secret police networks, the airports, other areas to be internal checkpoints.
[01:54:32.922 --> 01:54:35.884]  To target constitutional peace officers and things like that.
[01:54:35.884 --> 01:54:38.847]  I mean, we know how this takeover is going to look.
[01:54:38.847 --> 01:54:44.971]  And, you know, the government could do a false flag to go after the Liberty Movement at any time, or they could wait.
[01:54:44.971 --> 01:54:48.754]  The point is, is that we know this is being geared up, but we shouldn't even be afraid of it.
[01:54:48.754 --> 01:54:53.798]  We should be afraid of not speaking out against it and stopping it and exposing it.
[01:54:53.798 --> 01:54:54.579]  I get frustrated.
[01:54:54.579 --> 01:54:55.920]  People ask why I get mad at football.
[01:54:56.581 --> 01:55:05.224]  Well, they just obsess over the family of one quarterback and the other quarterback's family and what they eat for dinner and what they're into.
[01:55:05.224 --> 01:55:09.666]  It's all the military mind of man being projected onto something that doesn't matter.
[01:55:10.677 --> 01:55:26.325]  Like, we're studying thermal nuclear war, we're studying geopolitics, we're studying the stock market, we're studying the mindset of the elite, we're studying what's in the vaccines, we're studying... People think that's weird, like, studying real things, even though in the real world you can make a lot of money just in business knowing this stuff.
[01:55:26.325 --> 01:55:30.327]  This is how the elite think, except it's from their perspective.
[01:55:30.327 --> 01:55:34.109]  And then we try to spend time learning how the real world works, and it's weird.
[01:55:34.109 --> 01:55:37.651]  That's why I get very upset about the things of a child.
[01:55:38.527 --> 01:55:47.793]  It'd be one thing if you went to a ball game because your kid's in it, or you liked a sports team, but when it becomes God, it becomes a Romanesque, gladiatorial evil, and that's what makes me sick.
[01:55:47.793 --> 01:55:50.155]  We've got four minutes left, Joel Skousen.
[01:55:50.155 --> 01:55:51.336]  Thank you so much for the time.
[01:55:51.336 --> 01:55:52.576]  You've got the floor.
[01:55:52.576 --> 01:55:55.538]  Break down why you say Korea's the trigger.
[01:55:55.538 --> 01:55:57.820]  Most other big analysts agree with that, by the way.
[01:55:57.820 --> 01:56:06.506]  If it ever kicks off with China, how that would unfold, and why we've pivoted to the Pacific, and where that's going.
[01:56:08.556 --> 01:56:13.119]  Well, in the first place, the pivot to the Pacific is really only about a 10% increase in assets.
[01:56:13.119 --> 01:56:14.720]  It's not enough to deter China.
[01:56:14.720 --> 01:56:16.881]  It's just a mere facade.
[01:56:16.881 --> 01:56:18.242]  It's a little bit of political theater.
[01:56:19.013 --> 01:56:22.396]  There has to be a reason why North Korea has been preserved.
[01:56:22.396 --> 01:56:24.317]  That's why I say it's got to be the trigger.
[01:56:24.317 --> 01:56:33.885]  In other words, Iran, they've fumed, they've threatened, they have the military options on the table, they want regime change, we infiltrate, we use covert operations.
[01:56:33.885 --> 01:56:35.767]  We do none of that with North Korea.
[01:56:35.767 --> 01:56:40.591]  In fact, we've guaranteed them no regime change and no military options on the table.
[01:56:40.591 --> 01:56:40.851]  Why?
[01:56:40.851 --> 01:56:44.174]  They're the most awful, god-awful regime in the world!
[01:56:45.379 --> 01:56:46.640]  And yet we do nothing.
[01:56:46.640 --> 01:56:55.163]  And that's only because, it could only be because the globalists know that they are the puppet of China and that they will be the trigger.
[01:56:55.163 --> 01:56:56.644]  Here's how I think it's going down.
[01:56:56.644 --> 01:57:00.166]  I think there will be an attack against South Korea.
[01:57:00.166 --> 01:57:03.487]  The North Koreans have over 2 million troops.
[01:57:03.487 --> 01:57:07.489]  20,000 artillery troops, they can level Seoul in a matter of 3 or 4 days.
[01:57:07.489 --> 01:57:08.850]  The only way the U.S.
[01:57:08.850 --> 01:57:14.112]  can stop that attack from taking over the South is using tactical nuclear weapons.
[01:57:15.151 --> 01:57:19.693]  And that would give China the excuse, then, to nuke the United States.
[01:57:19.693 --> 01:57:20.133]  U.S.
[01:57:20.133 --> 01:57:21.533]  is guilty of first use.
[01:57:21.533 --> 01:57:21.853]  U.S.
[01:57:21.853 --> 01:57:23.214]  is the bully of the world.
[01:57:23.214 --> 01:57:25.995]  Russian-Chinese unite to launch against U.S.
[01:57:25.995 --> 01:57:26.855]  military targets.
[01:57:26.855 --> 01:57:29.036]  Not civilian targets, per se.
[01:57:29.036 --> 01:57:36.978]  There will be about 12 to 15 cities that are inextricably connected with the military that we're going to get hit, like I've mentioned in strategic relocation.
[01:57:36.978 --> 01:57:39.459]  You don't want to be in those cities when this attack comes.
[01:57:40.237 --> 01:57:46.780]  You may have two days notice when that attack in Korea starts before China launches on the United States.
[01:57:46.780 --> 01:57:59.144]  And if you ever see everything black out, because both Russia and China will use a preemptive nuclear or EMP strike, electromagnetic pulse strike, to take down the grid before the nukes actually fall.
[01:57:59.144 --> 01:58:08.488]  Anytime you see all electricity out and no news, nothing at all, that's the time you need to be getting out of those cities before the panic hits.
[01:58:09.286 --> 01:58:12.907]  Now, I think our globalists come out of their bunkers then.
[01:58:12.907 --> 01:58:14.168]  They'll survive the attack.
[01:58:14.168 --> 01:58:16.789]  They'll say the Russians and Chinese deceived us.
[01:58:16.789 --> 01:58:22.071]  We need to establish a global military, because our military's been taken down.
[01:58:22.071 --> 01:58:23.032]  No one to protect us.
[01:58:23.032 --> 01:58:24.672]  We need a global military force.
[01:58:24.672 --> 01:58:27.213]  And that's when the big World War III starts.
[01:58:27.213 --> 01:58:27.734]  That's right.
[01:58:27.734 --> 01:58:29.194]  That's when it starts.
[01:58:29.194 --> 01:58:31.395]  Only then, Alex, does the U.S.
[01:58:31.395 --> 01:58:36.017]  bring out the space-based weapons to stop Russia and China from hitting any more targets.
[01:58:36.926 --> 01:58:43.661]  I want to do five more on this and David Knight's coming in.
[01:58:43.661 --> 01:58:47.650]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:51.104 --> 01:58:54.426]  Globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[01:58:54.426 --> 01:58:56.848]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[01:58:56.848 --> 01:59:05.454]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[01:59:05.454 --> 01:59:20.764]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula sourced from powerful organic herbs and then concentrated for maximum
[01:59:21.004 --> 01:59:21.484]  I don't know.
[01:59:54.037 --> 02:00:05.343]  Waging war on... Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.343 --> 02:00:06.644]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.644 --> 02:00:08.424]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.424 --> 02:00:09.625]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:09.625 --> 02:00:11.766]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.766 --> 02:00:12.667]  We'll see.
[02:00:12.667 --> 02:00:16.869]  He's Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:16.869 --> 02:00:20.951]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.228 --> 02:00:24.390]  Alright folks, we're broadcasting worldwide.
[02:00:24.390 --> 02:00:33.098]  Daniel Osterlund from Spain is coming up with a lot of key intel, those inside sources, inside the global power structure.
[02:00:33.098 --> 02:00:35.120]  I've checked his sources, his info's very good.
[02:00:35.120 --> 02:00:39.403]  He'll be joining us via video Skype, which is gonna be great.
[02:00:39.403 --> 02:00:40.765]  We're usually on a crackly phone line.
[02:00:40.765 --> 02:00:42.927]  Uh, did you say you had that clip?
[02:00:42.927 --> 02:00:44.168]  I'm sorry, I heard you say something in my ear.
[02:00:45.720 --> 02:00:59.619]  Okay, well we're getting the clip of Obama saying he'll act alone and operate on his own, but he's been saying that a lot in the State of the Union yesterday, but later after Estalin leaves us, I want to talk about Vladimir Putin, because I really thought about Vladimir Putin a lot last night.
[02:01:00.629 --> 02:01:02.911]  And the geopolitical things that are happening.
[02:01:02.911 --> 02:01:22.007]  And when you've gone through the depths of evil like the Russians have for 80 years, I don't romanticize the strongman Putin, but there is a psychological thing that happens sometimes when someone's actually in control and Putin is in command to a great extent, where people actually want to build up society and get what you call a philosopher king.
[02:01:22.007 --> 02:01:25.910]  And the globalists actually endorse that idea, but they never really manifest it.
[02:01:25.910 --> 02:01:29.433]  I don't, I wouldn't say he is a philosopher king.
[02:01:31.435 --> 02:01:34.618]  But compared to Obama he is.
[02:01:34.618 --> 02:01:37.901]  Vladimir Putin is a philosopher king compared to Obama.
[02:01:37.901 --> 02:01:41.084]  Because he's saying men need to be strong, women need to be women and strong.
[02:01:41.084 --> 02:01:43.186]  Family, don't try to recruit kids.
[02:01:43.186 --> 02:01:46.790]  You want to destabilize us with psychological warfare.
[02:01:46.790 --> 02:01:47.851]  I mean that's what it is.
[02:01:49.090 --> 02:01:52.474]  They don't want to make kids gay because they love gay people.
[02:01:52.474 --> 02:01:56.699]  They want to absolutely rewrite... You're like trying to teach, you know, fish to be gay.
[02:01:56.699 --> 02:01:57.620]  Well, they wouldn't reproduce.
[02:01:57.620 --> 02:01:58.842]  There'd be no more fish.
[02:01:58.842 --> 02:01:59.903]  It's extinct yourself.
[02:01:59.903 --> 02:02:04.669]  It has nothing to do with hating someone's, you know, sexual situation.
[02:02:04.669 --> 02:02:06.231]  It's the force feeding of it.
[02:02:08.693 --> 02:02:25.211]  And Putin, I remember reading this and seeing this, was a big fan of Alexander Solzhenitsyn, who wrote the Gulag Archipelago, and talked about a strong Russia, nationalism, going back to freedom, being honorable, being stoic, and really kind of welding a 1776 type idea.
[02:02:28.510 --> 02:02:39.441]  into the old Russian stoic Viking, because that's what Russia is, means the Roots, the Red, really founded by the Vikings, Western Russia, and merged with some Asian groups, but that's what they are.
[02:02:39.441 --> 02:02:49.290]  It's kind of an Asiatic Viking group, Asian Vikings splice, and that's why Russians are so smart, but they also have their problems.
[02:02:49.290 --> 02:02:51.613]  They were under czarist systems for so long,
[02:02:52.697 --> 02:02:54.399]  That they never had a chance at freedom.
[02:02:54.399 --> 02:02:58.603]  And then our criminal government, with the big banks, on record put the Bolsheviks in, in 1917.
[02:02:58.603 --> 02:03:01.746]  I mean, we owe Russia such an apology.
[02:03:01.746 --> 02:03:04.089]  They've been our ally all along against the British.
[02:03:04.089 --> 02:03:06.191]  They did so much for this country.
[02:03:06.191 --> 02:03:07.732]  In the Civil War, you name it.
[02:03:08.513 --> 02:03:15.720]  And then we just absolutely let the globalists put in the worst of the worst and just butcher those people up one side and down the other.
[02:03:15.720 --> 02:03:23.467]  And they use Russia as a giant engine of evil against Ukraine, Poland, Romania, what's the Czech Republic now?
[02:03:23.467 --> 02:03:27.411]  And then create an incredible enmity between Slavs and Slavs.
[02:03:27.411 --> 02:03:28.292]  Just total evil.
[02:03:29.485 --> 02:03:32.008]  And now the West is attacking him with Al-Qaeda.
[02:03:32.008 --> 02:03:44.700]  And you look at Putin, he clearly, as people resonate with it, he is confident because he met a lot with Sholts and Eatson, and Sholts and Eatson literally grabbed Putin and said, you will not sell people out, you'll stop being a gangster.
[02:03:44.700 --> 02:03:47.743]  This is reportedly a decade ago, and this only leaked out through some of my...
[02:03:48.504 --> 02:03:49.364]  Connections and sources.
[02:03:49.364 --> 02:03:58.769]  I went and checked it and it's been hinted at here and there and confirmed that Shultz Adichin basically, and he met with him right before he died too, said stop being a sellout.
[02:03:58.769 --> 02:04:00.590]  Be a knight for Russia.
[02:04:00.590 --> 02:04:01.190]  Stand up.
[02:04:01.190 --> 02:04:02.231]  Be real.
[02:04:02.231 --> 02:04:03.631]  They will follow you.
[02:04:03.631 --> 02:04:06.953]  And that's why he came here in the 80s and Shultz Adichin left.
[02:04:06.953 --> 02:04:13.616]  Very honorable stoic man because he came and saw the decadence and the evil and he was like, it's growing here.
[02:04:13.616 --> 02:04:16.017]  And it's not even like the Soviets did this to us.
[02:04:16.017 --> 02:04:17.498]  They would just like a judo move
[02:04:18.584 --> 02:04:25.269]  Take all of our own evil that was already there, and then the punch comes, they would take it and pull it along with them.
[02:04:25.269 --> 02:04:27.911]  And that's why it's so easy to be evil.
[02:04:27.911 --> 02:04:32.734]  Because if you just want to wreck people and use their ignorance against them, of course you can dominate them.
[02:04:32.734 --> 02:04:35.736]  But who wants to dominate a destroyed person?
[02:04:35.736 --> 02:04:41.801]  You only dominate someone who is coming down on you and has attacked you first.
[02:04:41.801 --> 02:04:44.863]  And then, all bets are off, you gotta do whatever it takes to defeat them.
[02:04:46.021 --> 02:04:48.664]  And that's what we need, is real warriors of liberty.
[02:04:48.664 --> 02:04:57.193]  And I'm not saying Putin is perfect, but he has gone through a process that, compared to Obama, is very good.
[02:05:00.888 --> 02:05:06.695]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[02:05:06.695 --> 02:05:14.084]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[02:05:14.084 --> 02:05:17.449]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[02:05:17.449 --> 02:05:19.211]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[02:05:19.471 --> 02:05:24.115]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[02:05:24.115 --> 02:05:27.038]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[02:05:27.038 --> 02:05:32.983]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[02:05:32.983 --> 02:05:36.667]  It's made right here in the USA, completely non-GMO.
[02:05:36.667 --> 02:05:41.911]  I searched out the best quality and now have developed a double strength form of nascent iodine.

[02:06:28.220 --> 02:06:31.081]  It is the only one that does it and out of the gates!
[02:06:31.081 --> 02:06:34.702]  We have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[02:06:34.702 --> 02:06:49.428]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands,
[02:06:50.048 --> 02:07:00.719]  The facts are in.
[02:07:00.719 --> 02:07:03.161]  The studies are legion.
[02:07:03.161 --> 02:07:10.689]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[02:07:10.689 --> 02:07:14.112]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[02:07:14.472 --> 02:07:15.052]  Simple.
[02:07:15.052 --> 02:07:19.774]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[02:07:19.774 --> 02:07:25.496]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[02:07:25.496 --> 02:07:41.822]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Live Fluoride Shield Formulation, fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[02:07:41.822 --> 02:07:43.643]  Let's take a stand against the globalists.
[02:07:43.823 --> 02:07:46.385]  By blocking their poisons with Fluoride Shield.
[02:07:46.385 --> 02:07:48.547]  I use Fluoride Shield everyday.
[02:07:48.547 --> 02:07:54.112]  Secure your Fluoride Shield and other pioneering formulations at InfoWarsLife.com today.
[02:07:54.112 --> 02:07:58.516]  Let's start cleansing our bodies now and support the Info War at the same time.
[02:07:58.516 --> 02:07:59.797]  That's InfoWarsLife.com
[02:08:05.714 --> 02:08:10.557]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:08:10.557 --> 02:08:12.138]  You want answers?
[02:08:12.138 --> 02:08:13.679]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:13.679 --> 02:08:17.882]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:17.882 --> 02:08:21.945]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:45.027 --> 02:08:48.330]  And I'm eager to work with all of you.
[02:08:48.330 --> 02:08:59.760]  But America does not stand still and neither will I. So wherever and whenever I can take steps without legislation to expand opportunity for more American families, that's what I'm going to do.
[02:09:01.127 --> 02:09:06.490]  And he went on to say he'd use dictatorial powers to go after the Second Amendment and more.
[02:09:06.490 --> 02:09:07.851]  So what a speech!
[02:09:07.851 --> 02:09:09.913]  Daniel Estelin joins us.
[02:09:09.913 --> 02:09:13.315]  He is a best-selling author and a Bilderberg sleuth.
[02:09:13.315 --> 02:09:15.596]  And I consider him a friend of mine.
[02:09:15.596 --> 02:09:17.938]  And he's written an excellent new book.
[02:09:17.938 --> 02:09:21.220]  We're not selling it, but we should be selling it at the InfoWars store.
[02:09:21.220 --> 02:09:24.362]  Trans Evolution, the Coming Age of Human Destruction.
[02:09:24.362 --> 02:09:27.524]  Daniel Estelin, from the author of the True Story of the Bilderberg Group.
[02:09:28.536 --> 02:09:29.838]  And it's available from Trine Day.
[02:09:50.760 --> 02:10:09.378]  Vladimir Putin is talking about, it's bizarre folks, that they put top people over Russian state-run TV that basically talk about cancer viruses and vaccines, the plan to destroy the family, the new world order, and the Russians are going with a truthful way to try to unify their country from outside attack and overthrow.
[02:10:10.228 --> 02:10:18.370]  And I don't like the fact that Putin's been cracking down on the press and people, but those are foreign-proven Soros-run groups.
[02:10:18.370 --> 02:10:20.311]  So, it's a serious situation.
[02:10:20.311 --> 02:10:23.991]  What do you do when you are being infiltrated by foreign powers?
[02:10:23.991 --> 02:10:25.012]  That's what the New World Order is.
[02:10:25.012 --> 02:10:30.033]  It's a corporate, above-the-law, breakaway civilization that wants to build its own global technocracy.
[02:10:31.235 --> 02:10:42.801]  And Daniel Estlin, I happen to know, via some other connections, and Tucker before he died, and then some other folks, then I brought it up to Estlin one time over the phone, he said, well yeah, that is one of my sources.
[02:10:42.801 --> 02:10:45.202]  He really does have these big sources.
[02:10:45.202 --> 02:10:50.005]  High-level Hollywood, high-level banking, high-level Bilderberg.
[02:10:50.005 --> 02:10:55.408]  And so, that's why he's basically saying the same thing I say, because it's not like we're reading from the same sheet of music.
[02:10:56.716 --> 02:10:59.957]  It's not music we're looking at, it's a death warrant on humanity.
[02:10:59.957 --> 02:11:04.578]  We're looking from different perspectives at the same program being rolled out.
[02:11:04.578 --> 02:11:08.960]  And his book, I just began to read it this weekend, I'm almost done.
[02:11:08.960 --> 02:11:15.322]  I even learned something reading, which I know a lot.
[02:11:15.322 --> 02:11:21.664]  And just the way he puts things really gets people to think and it's got a good cover to get the average folks thinking out there.
[02:11:21.664 --> 02:11:26.065]  And the reason I'm pitching it, even though I'm not selling it, is it is really, really important.
[02:11:27.284 --> 02:11:35.267]  For people to understand the real mindset of who runs the planet.
[02:11:35.267 --> 02:11:54.373]  And so I want to get into his book first, but then, the bottom of the hour, I want him to give us his take on what's happening geopolitically, the race from Spain to where he's at, from Greece to Japan to everywhere towards dictatorship, and towards Goldman Sachs people being appointed as presidents.
[02:11:54.373 --> 02:11:54.873]  I mean, this is
[02:11:55.950 --> 02:11:57.130]  This is corporate world government.
[02:11:57.130 --> 02:12:03.272]  What do you think about Soros trying to overthrow Ukraine because they wouldn't join the EU?
[02:12:03.272 --> 02:12:09.893]  Just simply amazing the time in history we're entering and the fact that we've been so right.
[02:12:09.893 --> 02:12:11.033]  I wish we weren't right.
[02:12:11.033 --> 02:12:16.014]  Daniel, do you wake up a lot of times in the middle of the night like I do and just wish that we'd been wrong?
[02:12:16.014 --> 02:12:19.035]  I mean, it's not very satisfying to be so dead on, is it?
[02:12:20.716 --> 02:12:21.237]  No, it's not.
[02:12:21.237 --> 02:12:23.718]  First of all, Alex, it's great to be back on your show.
[02:12:23.718 --> 02:12:26.320]  I certainly do consider you to be a very, very good friend of mine.
[02:12:26.320 --> 02:12:36.187]  I'm very proud of all the things that you and I have done together over the years, standing shoulder to shoulder way back in the 2006 Buildable Conference, if you remember, and a few other events as well.
[02:12:36.187 --> 02:12:39.089]  So I'm very, very, very honored to be back on your show.
[02:12:39.089 --> 02:12:45.634]  You know, it's, as you said, you know, from Greece to Spain to the United States, Ukraine, Russia,
[02:12:46.494 --> 02:12:47.454]  We've seen this before.
[02:12:47.454 --> 02:12:51.396]  It's déjà vu, you know, over and over and over again.
[02:12:51.396 --> 02:13:02.980]  Be it Soros in the Ukraine or be it Soros in the Soviet Union or post-Soviet Union Russia as they try to destroy Russia, you know, in the 1990s, trying to turn it into a...
[02:13:04.640 --> 02:13:07.202]  Well, it lost its statehood.
[02:13:07.202 --> 02:13:08.804]  It became a protectorate.
[02:13:08.804 --> 02:13:19.813]  And you have the Human Rights Watch in there, you have the George Soros' and the Harvard Endowment, and the Carnegie's, and Goldman Sachs, and the same players over and over again in all these same locations, always doing the same thing.
[02:13:19.813 --> 02:13:25.578]  And as some of my sources have said, when I asked them, I said, why do you guys always do the same thing over and over again?
[02:13:25.578 --> 02:13:27.881]  They said to me, because it works!
[02:13:27.881 --> 02:13:28.941]  Why would we change?
[02:13:29.844 --> 02:13:30.545]  That's right.
[02:13:30.545 --> 02:13:32.969]  That's why they run the same attack profile.
[02:13:32.969 --> 02:13:37.637]  But I think that is their weakness, is that if we get the public to realize that, it's game over.
[02:13:37.637 --> 02:13:40.482]  And I think their old tricks are starting to fail.
[02:13:41.678 --> 02:13:44.179]  You know, you have a very good point there, Alex.
[02:13:44.179 --> 02:13:49.701]  I listen to your show, not every night, but certainly a lot of the times, because, you know, your morning is our afternoon.
[02:13:49.701 --> 02:13:53.402]  It's 7 o'clock, 7.15 in the afternoon here, p.m.
[02:13:53.402 --> 02:14:03.465]  But, you know, back in 2005, when Jim Tucker, God bless his soul and I, were the only two journalists who covered the Rotterdam-Bilderberg conference.
[02:14:03.465 --> 02:14:04.686]  And at that conference,
[02:14:05.186 --> 02:14:13.687]  I learned something, which basically is the backbone to this new book, The Transhumanism of the Coming Age of Human Deconstruction.
[02:14:13.687 --> 02:14:27.490]  It was based on the discussion at that meeting, which later turned into the Strategic Trends Report, 2007-2036, which at the time was a secret source document on the future of humanity.
[02:14:27.490 --> 02:14:33.991]  I got a hold of that in 2005, I was looking through it, and I said to myself, this isn't the future, this is the present.
[02:14:34.651 --> 02:14:47.383]  And the president that they were talking about back in 2005, which turned in 2007 into a report which is now available, you can download it for free on the internet, is the backbone of what we're seeing right now.
[02:14:47.383 --> 02:14:49.185]  You know, the age of transition.
[02:14:49.185 --> 02:14:52.087]  Transition to a global civilization.
[02:14:52.087 --> 02:14:54.169]  And this is exactly what we're seeing right now.
[02:14:54.169 --> 02:14:58.473]  It's not the terms from back then that I remember reading in the report.
[02:14:58.473 --> 02:15:00.155]  They were talking about flash mobs.
[02:15:00.970 --> 02:15:02.892]  What was a flash mob I said to myself in 2005?
[02:15:02.892 --> 02:15:05.495]  I don't understand what it means.
[02:15:05.495 --> 02:15:14.905]  What we do now, you look at Turkey, you look at Kiev, one day everything is fine, the next day the city is being burned down by people we don't know where they came from.
[02:15:14.905 --> 02:15:16.307]  That's a flash mob.
[02:15:16.307 --> 02:15:19.731]  It was in the report, which is the backbone to my book Transhumanism.
[02:15:21.371 --> 02:15:26.213]  Amazing, and just put it all in scope and then we'll drill down into details.
[02:15:26.213 --> 02:15:27.473]  What is the master plan?
[02:15:27.473 --> 02:15:36.276]  If you say you had four minutes till break, four minutes to talk to three million people and encapsulate, if they succeed, what will be left and what the timescales are?
[02:15:37.080 --> 02:15:40.804]  You know, it's interesting because, you know, the basic theory is this.
[02:15:40.804 --> 02:15:45.549]  If you think of a pyramidal structure, Alex, 6,000 years ago, who controlled knowledge?
[02:15:45.549 --> 02:15:46.670]  High priests.
[02:15:46.670 --> 02:15:49.193]  And they fed it to us one little droplet at a time.
[02:15:49.193 --> 02:15:59.404]  We, the great unwashed then or now, basically were fed this information just enough so we could do our daily, you know, chores and live day to day.
[02:15:59.884 --> 02:16:05.805]  Well today, this pyramid is an upside down pyramid because of the internet revolution.
[02:16:05.805 --> 02:16:22.109]  Anybody, anywhere in the world, the UI, somebody in Japan, or a Koya Indian sitting in a tree in the middle of an Amazon forest, with a computer and access to internet, has access at his fingertips to the entire history of knowledge of mankind.
[02:16:22.109 --> 02:16:23.209]  So if you're the elite,
[02:16:23.749 --> 02:16:30.798]  That's bad news for them because suddenly the playing field because of these technological advancements has been evened on the one hand.
[02:16:30.798 --> 02:16:34.862]  But on the other hand, the elite said to themselves, we got to do something.
[02:16:34.862 --> 02:16:40.269]  And they're using the technology and the advancement to create a bigger and bigger and bigger gap
[02:16:40.569 --> 02:16:43.710]  Which we thought, you know, was actually being bridged.
[02:16:43.710 --> 02:16:56.352]  So, you know, if you spent trillions or quadrillions or gazillions of dollars in trying to, you know, use the technology to get so far ahead of where we are right now, you can actually do this because they have the money.
[02:16:56.352 --> 02:17:05.714]  And, you know, one of the things I'm talking about in this book, and it is, I think, absolutely revolutionary, is that our children, your children, my children, my oldest daughter is 16, they're the last
[02:17:07.194 --> 02:17:10.197]  Truly human generation of human beings on the planet.
[02:17:10.197 --> 02:17:23.890]  Her children and you know her children's children are going to be trans humans, post humans, man-machine, cyborgs, beings who are not totally human, humans who are not 100% beings.
[02:17:23.890 --> 02:17:29.315]  We're literally living at the cusp of the greatest change in the history of mankind
[02:17:29.875 --> 02:17:32.617]  And it has nothing to do with a microchip in your hand.
[02:17:32.617 --> 02:17:44.327]  It is technology that is so advanced that people literally will be able to, in less than a generation, download their consciousness onto a computer and live forever.
[02:17:44.327 --> 02:17:46.789]  And that's what a transhumanist movement is all about.
[02:17:46.789 --> 02:17:52.234]  That's why my book is called Trans Evolution, The Coming Age of Human Deconstruction.
[02:17:53.474 --> 02:17:56.655]  And they're saying they're not going to give us free will.
[02:17:56.655 --> 02:17:58.395]  They're just going to do it.
[02:17:58.395 --> 02:18:00.596]  And it's so much more advanced than a chip.
[02:18:00.596 --> 02:18:07.977]  We carry a little computer that watches everything we do and tracks everything we do better than a supercomputer of 20 years ago.
[02:18:07.977 --> 02:18:09.357]  Now they have the quantum computers.
[02:18:09.357 --> 02:18:16.279]  And the key here, Daniel, is the prediction of the future, where Amazon can now ship you your order before you order it with 100% accuracy.
[02:18:17.839 --> 02:18:28.216]  This was always the key, the literal crystal ball where they get enough data on the world and how things work, they can predict the future, and then with that data they can manipulate the future.
[02:18:28.216 --> 02:18:31.882]  We're literally seeing God-like power being given to this degenerate elite.
[02:18:33.456 --> 02:18:34.757]  It's very interesting, Alex.
[02:18:34.757 --> 02:18:38.960]  In the last 50 years, we've learned more than the entire history of mankind.
[02:18:38.960 --> 02:18:44.203]  And in the next 20, we'll have learned more than the last 50 in all the history of mankind.
[02:18:44.203 --> 02:18:50.467]  And it's going to get to a point in about a generation and a half from now, where we'll be doubling our knowledge every year.
[02:18:50.467 --> 02:18:55.810]  And that's something unfathomable for people, because we don't even know what the future is going to look like.
[02:18:55.810 --> 02:18:57.651]  And that's one of the things about this book.
[02:18:57.651 --> 02:18:59.733]  You know, with Build a Book, I answered a lot of the questions.
[02:18:59.733 --> 02:19:01.634]  But with this book, when you finish it,
[02:19:02.054 --> 02:19:07.919]  You have more questions than answers because it's the future, and we really don't know even if we try to extrapolate it.
[02:19:07.919 --> 02:19:12.742]  There's just so many unknowns, but we certainly see where all of it is going.
[02:19:12.742 --> 02:19:19.988]  That's right, and the elite may be good at watching us and manipulating us, but look at them themselves trying to dumb us down and control us.
[02:19:19.988 --> 02:19:22.690]  That shows they're not enlightened right there.
[02:19:22.690 --> 02:19:26.473]  And with this power, I don't know if we're going to make it out of this, Daniel.
[02:19:27.512 --> 02:19:30.275]  Well, they need to dumb us down.
[02:19:30.275 --> 02:19:51.296]  The basement of education is part of it because people who are aware of what's going on, people who understand history, who understand geography, who can add, who can subtract, who are interested and keen, and who realize that what separates us from animals is this divine spark of reason that we have, which allows us to invent, to investigate,
[02:19:51.776 --> 02:19:59.822]  To the empowered individuals with the spark of creativity to where we might have our own destiny instead of being their robot slaves.
[02:20:01.403 --> 02:20:05.366]  A lot of people's lives and bodies are out of balance.
[02:20:05.366 --> 02:20:10.850]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops optimize pH level and get rid of harmful waste and acid.
[02:20:10.850 --> 02:20:15.413]  Just a few drops in water restores vibrance and energy and gets you back in balance.

[02:24:17.175 --> 02:24:18.777]  Playing that acoustic.
[02:24:18.777 --> 02:24:22.381]  See that's the issue, is they are...
[02:24:31.289 --> 02:24:33.110]  seducing us with these technologies.
[02:24:33.110 --> 02:24:34.971]  They're rolling them out.
[02:24:34.971 --> 02:24:36.571]  They let it have some good aspects.
[02:24:36.571 --> 02:24:41.854]  But down the road, we're already now to that point, it's about total human control.
[02:24:41.854 --> 02:24:43.034]  The NSA, all of it.
[02:24:43.034 --> 02:24:47.396]  And like children, the public are taught to deny that this stuff's even going on.
[02:24:47.396 --> 02:24:49.717]  But Daniel Estillan is an expert on this.
[02:24:49.717 --> 02:24:50.738]  He has the sources.
[02:24:50.738 --> 02:24:53.919]  So much of this is now out in the open.
[02:24:53.919 --> 02:24:56.100]  A big hope is within the establishment itself.
[02:24:56.100 --> 02:24:57.281]  They may, you know, need to
[02:24:58.123 --> 02:25:01.924]  Basically get religion to understand this program will destroy them.
[02:25:01.924 --> 02:25:06.326]  But they say they're willing to do that if it allows them to have immortality.
[02:25:06.326 --> 02:25:11.268]  They believe they'll have immortality merging with her.
[02:25:11.268 --> 02:25:14.889]  To use that example of the popular film out there, a very powerful dystopic film.
[02:25:14.889 --> 02:25:17.690]  I want to do a review of soon.
[02:25:17.690 --> 02:25:18.810]  And that's what we're facing here.
[02:25:18.810 --> 02:25:21.671]  This is the end of humanity.
[02:25:21.671 --> 02:25:23.692]  You can see this technology is dumbing us down.
[02:25:23.692 --> 02:25:25.373]  It's not empowering us overall.
[02:25:26.013 --> 02:25:29.776]  Because it's being deployed in a dehumanizing way.
[02:25:29.776 --> 02:25:32.078]  Daniel Esselstyn, this is the most powerful interview ever with you.
[02:25:32.078 --> 02:25:35.760]  You're really getting fiery here talking about to be or not to be.
[02:25:35.760 --> 02:25:38.262]  That is the question, that spark of humanity.
[02:25:38.262 --> 02:25:39.523]  Well, I choose to be...
[02:25:40.598 --> 02:25:41.999]  Be a human.
[02:25:41.999 --> 02:25:45.281]  I've seen all the disasters these people engage in.
[02:25:45.281 --> 02:25:47.263]  And what I'm saying is, they've got a big plan.
[02:25:47.263 --> 02:25:48.384]  They are visionaries.
[02:25:48.384 --> 02:25:49.124]  They're in control.
[02:25:49.124 --> 02:25:50.845]  They steal our wealth.
[02:25:50.845 --> 02:25:55.308]  But I'm saying I don't like their dream, and I don't think their dream will succeed.
[02:25:55.308 --> 02:25:59.591]  But regardless, we need to educate the public about their nightmare they're trying to create.
[02:25:59.591 --> 02:26:00.152]  Daniel Estilian.
[02:26:00.828 --> 02:26:01.689]  Absolutely, Alex.
[02:26:01.689 --> 02:26:02.590]  You know, God bless you.
[02:26:02.590 --> 02:26:07.394]  You know, what is absolutely, you know, is true is that the rise of the machine is here.
[02:26:07.394 --> 02:26:12.739]  And we're facing the time of the unconscious evolution period is almost finished.
[02:26:12.739 --> 02:26:19.686]  And we'll come to this new period when a controlled human evolution can and will happen, and the elite believe that it will happen.
[02:26:19.686 --> 02:26:24.731]  Technological progress will be concentrated on making a new body for the human being.
[02:26:25.311 --> 02:26:31.995]  The plan is to incrementally move the human mind into more disembodied and futuristic vehicles.
[02:26:31.995 --> 02:26:33.816]  Not bodies, but vehicles.
[02:26:33.816 --> 02:26:39.759]  First, a humanoid robot controlled entirely by a human brain via brain-machine interface.
[02:26:40.239 --> 02:26:52.104]  Then a conscious human brain transplanted into a humanoid robot, then consciousness uploaded to a computer, and finally a hologram that contains a full conscious human mind.
[02:26:52.104 --> 02:26:57.966]  DARPA is finding dozens of human augmentation projects around the world to radically improve the performance
[02:26:58.346 --> 02:27:04.050]  Mental capacity and resilience first in soldiers obviously and then later on in humans.
[02:27:04.050 --> 02:27:20.321]  Everything from tapping the potential of our unconscious mind to augmented cognition and the creation of an uninhibited combat vehicles whereby the military expects in the very near future for individual pilots to fly entire squadrons of robot planes.
[02:27:20.321 --> 02:27:27.506]  They're working on you know this mind-boggling experience such as cybernetic insects and we see this in films like G.I.
[02:27:27.506 --> 02:27:27.866]  Joe.
[02:27:28.366 --> 02:27:29.266]  It's already there.
[02:27:29.266 --> 02:27:43.692]  It is a total genetic rewrite of the planet, overthrowing the creation, and then you look at the byproduct, the fruits of all their programs, it's dehumanizing, it's not even empowering, and they're not being honest with the public.
[02:27:43.692 --> 02:27:45.893]  All the white papers you're mentioning that your book's based on
[02:27:46.793 --> 02:27:48.134]  It's out there.
[02:27:48.134 --> 02:27:56.861]  It's on record, but people need to understand this is the end of humanity and they are aggressively right now trying to destroy the family.
[02:27:56.861 --> 02:27:59.984]  Vladimir Putin speaks out against that and he's a bad person.
[02:28:00.999 --> 02:28:11.263]  You know, because of the synergy, Alex, the interplay of three great revolutions, the quantum, the computer and biotech revolutions, again, we have learned so much in such a short period of time.
[02:28:11.263 --> 02:28:24.889]  The marvels of science like the internet, telecommunication satellites, laser beams, radio, television, microwaves, structures of DNA molecules, biotechnology, all of it ultimately comes from quantum theory and they dominate this.
[02:28:24.889 --> 02:28:27.170]  You know, we have the means through genetics.
[02:28:28.090 --> 02:28:33.954]  Robotics, information technology, and nanotech to control matter, energy, and life itself.
[02:28:33.954 --> 02:28:36.256]  We have never seen anything like this before.
[02:28:36.256 --> 02:28:40.278]  And it is raising profound questions about what it means to be human.
[02:28:40.278 --> 02:28:48.103]  And some of these questions, you know, we're seeing by public officials, Putin is talking about this, which is one of the reasons I'm mentioning this.
[02:28:48.103 --> 02:28:50.325]  It is being completely ignored in the United States.
[02:28:50.905 --> 02:29:00.308]  But this intense cross-pollination between the computer, biotech, and quantum revolutions will give us unprecedented power in the 21st century.
[02:29:00.308 --> 02:29:04.990]  And this is something that, as you said, people simply are unaware of.
[02:29:04.990 --> 02:29:05.450]  That's right.
[02:29:05.450 --> 02:29:10.672]  And I'm going to talk to you in the next long segment, this is intriguing, Daniel, about your ideas.
[02:29:12.270 --> 02:29:38.416]  To try to turn this around, because I believe if we can have a revolution through your book and other systems of understanding about this, and have humans know that they've got to actively be part of this decision-making process, it could actually empower humanity with the nanotech, the rest of it, and we could literally be launching space fleets in just a few decades to colonize space in a way to empower humanity while maintaining our humanity, but also if we choose, then having a separate
[02:29:39.236 --> 02:29:57.137]  Almost avatar that we test these systems with and I believe that is the program that should be followed But I want to talk about this on the other side with you We're on the march the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[02:30:01.232 --> 02:30:10.322]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:30:10.322 --> 02:30:18.731]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:30:18.731 --> 02:30:23.416]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[02:30:37.564 --> 02:30:44.588]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:30:44.588 --> 02:30:48.931]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.

[02:31:01.196 --> 02:31:08.099]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine.
[02:31:08.099 --> 02:31:11.901]  A practice now banned in nations around the world.
[02:31:11.901 --> 02:31:13.742]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[02:31:13.942 --> 02:31:14.802]  Fluoride.
[02:31:14.802 --> 02:31:16.743]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[02:31:16.743 --> 02:31:23.326]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[02:31:23.326 --> 02:31:28.249]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[02:31:28.249 --> 02:31:34.552]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[02:31:34.552 --> 02:31:36.973]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[02:31:36.973 --> 02:31:39.914]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[02:31:39.914 --> 02:31:43.296]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.

[02:32:04.204 --> 02:32:09.209]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[02:32:09.209 --> 02:32:16.396]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[02:32:16.536 --> 02:32:22.161]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.

[02:33:10.802 --> 02:33:15.723]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[02:33:15.723 --> 02:33:19.824]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:19.824 --> 02:33:24.385]  Bottom line, I want to defend the human continuity.
[02:33:24.385 --> 02:33:32.766]  We have seed banks, the globalists have emergency seed and art banks because they know they're rewriting the entire genetic code of the planet in case things go wrong.
[02:33:32.766 --> 02:33:33.567]  They have a backup.
[02:33:33.567 --> 02:33:35.007]  What about a backup for humanity?
[02:33:38.084 --> 02:33:56.333]  Undoubtedly, the eugenicists that developed biometrics in 1860s and envisioned the genetic code and the double helix that has been the ancient sign of medicine for 6,000 years, the ancients knew a lot more, folks, than the modern historians will tell you.
[02:33:56.333 --> 02:33:58.794]  And that's all part of the secret societies.
[02:33:58.794 --> 02:34:07.338]  That's all part of the Illuminati, the priest class that Daniel Estilum was so eloquently, investigative journalist, bestselling author, sold tens of millions of copies of his
[02:34:07.978 --> 02:34:09.539]  Non-fiction books in Europe.
[02:34:09.539 --> 02:34:17.424]  He's also written novels that are basically like pachinic real, but the names are changed to protect the innocent.
[02:34:17.424 --> 02:34:23.128]  And a lot of important information at his website as well.
[02:34:23.128 --> 02:34:25.329]  And I will give you that address.
[02:34:25.329 --> 02:34:27.491]  It's danielesland.com.
[02:34:27.491 --> 02:34:31.353]  I know his site, but he's got several, several others up there, but that's, that's the main one.
[02:34:31.353 --> 02:34:32.174]  It's an excellent site.
[02:34:33.257 --> 02:34:37.360]  But I want to talk to him about free will, because that's what he's getting at here.
[02:34:37.360 --> 02:34:38.641]  This is freedom versus slavery.
[02:34:38.641 --> 02:34:42.384]  I'm not against humans developing and advancing.
[02:34:42.384 --> 02:34:46.327]  The problem is the spirit that animates, the ghost that animates
[02:34:47.236 --> 02:34:50.677]  The globalist machine is very anti-human, very predatory.
[02:34:50.677 --> 02:34:53.158]  Hey, let the troops use DU, let them die.
[02:34:53.158 --> 02:34:58.540]  Hey, let the Navy drive through the radiation and let the troops be in wheelchairs and catheterized and dying.
[02:34:58.540 --> 02:34:59.361]  So what?
[02:34:59.361 --> 02:35:02.222]  But then have football games, how much we love the troops.
[02:35:02.222 --> 02:35:06.703]  The globalists hate pure, good, loving people.
[02:35:06.703 --> 02:35:10.405]  They hate altruistic knights.
[02:35:10.405 --> 02:35:11.385]  More and more I realize that.
[02:35:11.385 --> 02:35:13.086]  They are threatened by good people.
[02:35:13.976 --> 02:35:24.610]  Because they've cheated to get into control, and they can't help their psychopathic and sociopathic and other, you know, criminology designations.
[02:35:24.610 --> 02:35:28.676]  And it is a predatory group that's infested civilization since its beginnings.
[02:35:28.676 --> 02:35:30.078]  So I want to ask Daniel Lesterlin.
[02:35:31.365 --> 02:35:40.234]  We need to put out, because obviously no one's going to stop this march forward, and the church is so controlled, they just say, oh, the world's going to end next week, don't worry about it, but obviously that's not what's going on here.
[02:35:40.234 --> 02:35:41.836]  There's a great challenge coming.
[02:35:41.836 --> 02:35:46.060]  We need to be the salt of the earth, and I'm asking you what you think we should do to say, hey,
[02:35:46.974 --> 02:35:48.975]  There is advanced breakaway civilization.
[02:35:48.975 --> 02:35:51.095]  It's 30, 40 years ahead, the globalists say.
[02:35:51.095 --> 02:35:56.497]  A. How advanced are they in the breakaway civilization in the corporate and government reservations?
[02:35:56.497 --> 02:36:15.943]  And B. What is an alternate vision where we can try to capture the imagination of the public about what's really happening so they're not obsessed with Justin Bieber and they're obsessed more with giant space colony missions to the nearest star systems and habitable planets and the real trailblazer master builder spirit of humanity.
[02:36:17.315 --> 02:36:18.915]  These are very good questions, Alex.
[02:36:18.915 --> 02:36:20.056]  Very, very good questions.
[02:36:20.056 --> 02:36:23.036]  You can summarize it, I think, the following way.
[02:36:23.036 --> 02:36:30.858]  You know, you have to understand that the people who are our enemy are not the Rockefellers and Rothschilds.
[02:36:30.858 --> 02:36:33.019]  They're just the names.
[02:36:33.019 --> 02:36:36.359]  But it's a different movement.
[02:36:36.359 --> 02:36:40.380]  One of the things I talk about in the book is this transhumanist movement.
[02:36:40.380 --> 02:36:42.601]  We're taking as this vector for the future.
[02:36:43.241 --> 02:37:03.827]  Mega projects such as Russia 2045 movement, which they intend to create this new civilization aimed at future human development and evolution by integrating these new discoveries and developments from science, from physics, you know, energetics, aeronautics, bioengineering, nanotechnology, neurology, cybernetics, cognitive science, and on and so forth.
[02:37:04.266 --> 02:37:10.711]  And the Rockefellers of this world really have nothing to do or to say in this matter, because they will have been dead by then.
[02:37:10.711 --> 02:37:19.297]  But the point is that the transhumanists, and I think the face of transhumanism is Ray Kurzweil, one of the greatest inventors of the 20th century.
[02:37:19.297 --> 02:37:24.921]  Unfortunately, a lot of the things that are being done by him right now have very little to do with helping humanity.
[02:37:24.921 --> 02:37:30.265]  He was one of the... The head of Google development, he thinks he's going to become God.
[02:37:30.919 --> 02:37:33.122]  That's right, exactly, right, Carl Zweil.
[02:37:33.122 --> 02:37:46.578]  Now, the whole idea behind this transhumanist movement, if you want to know what it is, it's as simple as H+, human plus transhuman, is this ultra high-tech dream of computer scientists, philosophers, neuroscientists, and many others.
[02:37:47.259 --> 02:37:54.881]  To use radical advances in technology to augment the human body, human mind, and ultimately the entire human experience.
[02:37:54.881 --> 02:38:08.604]  And these people wish to become post-human, which is someone who has been modified, and with performance enhancing body, not drugs, body and brain augmentations, to the point that they could no longer call themselves human.
[02:38:08.604 --> 02:38:11.665]  Which is why, again, the Rockefellers have nothing to do with it.
[02:38:11.665 --> 02:38:13.405]  And they describe us like bugs.
[02:38:13.985 --> 02:38:17.893]  That okay, you don't have to get augmented, but you'll be like a bug, we might step on you.
[02:38:17.893 --> 02:38:22.323]  And my issue is that Google and the rest of them at the head of this...
[02:38:24.653 --> 02:38:27.195]  The systems are all being designed to control.
[02:38:27.195 --> 02:38:32.278]  They claim on the surface it's a system to empower, but I don't see that at the heart of it.
[02:38:54.893 --> 02:38:57.814]  A key concept, you know, for the transhumanist movement.
[02:38:57.814 --> 02:39:03.535]  And they can achieve this through a recalibration of the pleasure called centers in the brain.
[02:39:03.535 --> 02:39:06.376]  Pharmaceutical mood renders have been suggested.
[02:39:06.376 --> 02:39:07.996]  Wireheads.
[02:39:07.996 --> 02:39:11.397]  Exactly, which will be cleaner and safer than the mind-altering drugs.
[02:39:11.397 --> 02:39:18.479]  This is Huxley's 21st century vision of scientific dictatorship without tears.
[02:39:18.479 --> 02:39:19.679]  But behind all of this,
[02:39:20.399 --> 02:39:27.783]  No matter how you look at it, you know, this technology is something that, you know, we've talked about a lot before.
[02:39:27.783 --> 02:39:30.485]  It's a transhumanist movement.
[02:39:30.485 --> 02:39:38.970]  And the post-humanity, you know, will be a new human which has been genetically engineered and brain-chipped for total control, part man and part machine.
[02:39:38.970 --> 02:39:43.753]  This new man will no longer have a need of the sexual reproductive function.
[02:39:43.753 --> 02:39:44.153]  That's right.
[02:39:44.153 --> 02:39:46.795]  And his plan is to reduce the world's population
[02:39:47.403 --> 02:39:49.304]  You know, I can't think of a better way to do that.
[02:39:49.304 --> 02:40:02.550]  And not only that, but through synthetic biology, the change in our DNA through genetically modified crops, they can literally create beings who are not human, that have never existed on the planet Earth.
[02:40:02.550 --> 02:40:05.892]  So why do they need men and women, you know, as a couple?
[02:40:05.892 --> 02:40:07.353]  They don't need that anymore.
[02:40:07.353 --> 02:40:13.696]  Which is why, as you said on your website yesterday, I think it was, you know, talking about the Illuminati agenda at the last Grammy Awards.
[02:40:14.016 --> 02:40:22.283]  Well, this is exactly why they're pushing it, and this is one of the reasons why they hate people like Putin, who is absolutely against this kind of an agenda.
[02:40:22.283 --> 02:40:24.905]  That's right, and here's the key I want to ask you this point.
[02:40:25.731 --> 02:40:52.657]  They're toxifying the environment on purpose, then the crisis comes, they use that to bring in agenda 21 and neo-feudalism to shut people down for social control, so we can then follow their scientific dictatorial edicts, always posing as the savior, and clearly destroying reproductive fertility, clearly wrecking humanity, where it's going to be impossible to live in the civilization unless you accept the transhumanism
[02:40:53.638 --> 02:40:55.461]  It is simply, simply amazing.
[02:40:55.461 --> 02:40:58.525]  This is beyond a H.P.
[02:40:58.525 --> 02:40:59.326]  Lovecraft book.
[02:40:59.326 --> 02:41:03.453]  It's beyond a Dracula.
[02:41:03.453 --> 02:41:07.419]  This is literally something out of the mind of the devil.
[02:41:07.981 --> 02:41:16.923]  Well, Alex, you know, these technologies, and again, you've talked about this, are not being developed to stop the terrorists, but rather to stop us, the people.
[02:41:16.923 --> 02:41:21.084]  And the laws to justify these technologies, they're not written on a whim.
[02:41:21.084 --> 02:41:32.826]  They're specifically designed to give the government carte blanche authority over the people during the chaos and confusion of the period we're in right now, which the elite call the Age of Transition.
[02:41:32.826 --> 02:41:36.087]  Transition to a planetary civilization.
[02:41:36.627 --> 02:41:41.191]  And I think people have to realize that the Bin Lads and the Qaddafis are not the enemy.
[02:41:41.191 --> 02:41:42.892]  They never were the enemy.
[02:41:42.892 --> 02:41:45.174]  We, the people, are the enemy.
[02:41:45.174 --> 02:41:45.674]  That's right.
[02:41:45.674 --> 02:41:51.599]  We are allowing ourselves to be seduced by this, as we cover in my film, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, that you're in.
[02:41:51.599 --> 02:41:56.363]  And when that came out eight years ago, it was a big hit because people thought it was science fiction.
[02:41:56.363 --> 02:41:57.264]  Now they're watching it.
[02:41:57.264 --> 02:42:03.349]  The film's more popular than it's ever been because now it almost all came true eight years later.
[02:42:04.159 --> 02:42:09.741]  You know, I used to buy boxes of your film, Alex, you know, and, you know, go on trips, because I travel a lot.
[02:42:09.741 --> 02:42:15.624]  Last year, I did 240,000 kilometers, about 200,000 miles, of traveling around the world.
[02:42:15.624 --> 02:42:21.106]  And I used to give your CDs of your films away to people, and they're saying, who is this Alex Jones character?
[02:42:21.106 --> 02:42:23.907]  I said, watch the film, and you'll realize.
[02:42:23.907 --> 02:42:32.351]  And again, please understand, those who are watching and listening to us right now, these are not publicly funded projects for the betterment of humanity, but they're
[02:42:32.731 --> 02:42:53.559]  Mostly secret experiments sanctioned in the name of defense, which when you put it on its head is crime prevention and extrapolated into the future is stalemate to pull down any rebellion by the 99% of the world's population destined to live in abject poverty and crime infested megacities of the future.
[02:42:54.019 --> 02:43:04.923]  Just as the Strategic Trends Report talks about, which I read way, way, way back in 2005, almost 10 years ago, and so much, if not all of it, is, you know, coming true.
[02:43:04.923 --> 02:43:06.284]  That's what's incredible.
[02:43:06.284 --> 02:43:07.344]  That's what's incredible.
[02:43:07.344 --> 02:43:12.546]  And people need to understand, they go, I don't care if the NSA watches me or whatever, because I've done nothing wrong.
[02:43:13.126 --> 02:43:14.867]  Well, why don't you live in a glass house then?
[02:43:14.867 --> 02:43:25.652]  Why don't you... I mean, I'm tempted to dress up like an agent, you know, in black, a man in black, and then go look in people's windows in broad daylight and see them call the police on me, and I'm going to say, well, what's wrong?
[02:43:25.652 --> 02:43:35.457]  The government does it just to illustrate with a camera crew, or to go up to people on the street and say, do you mind if you wear a clear raincoat just to make sure you're not carrying a weapon?
[02:43:35.457 --> 02:43:37.498]  And they'll go, well, of course, I'm not going to do that, and go, well, wait.
[02:43:38.078 --> 02:43:41.343]  New York's already trying to make people only have clear bags.
[02:43:41.343 --> 02:43:48.314]  You know, the point is, we're being trained to be slaves, not even to be enslaved, but to stand down so we can be erased.
[02:43:48.314 --> 02:43:49.737]  Daniel, let me ask you this question.
[02:43:52.113 --> 02:43:53.573]  Do you think they're going to succeed?
[02:43:53.573 --> 02:43:55.974]  What does your gut tell you and what is the time frame?
[02:43:55.974 --> 02:44:07.256]  I don't know what the time frame is because, again, one of the things about this book, and it's a bit unnerving in the sense that it asks more questions than it answers because, again, we're talking about the future.
[02:44:07.256 --> 02:44:17.158]  But I think what is absolutely undeniable is this divine spark of reason, which makes us so different from anything else on this planet, can never be replicated.
[02:44:17.518 --> 02:44:27.786]  No matter whether your name is Ray Kurzweil, you know, Jason Silva, or any one of these other characters, billionaires and zillionaires, who want to literally turn us into something we're not.
[02:44:27.786 --> 02:44:28.666]  Man-machine.
[02:44:28.666 --> 02:44:30.848]  You know, future post-humans.
[02:44:30.848 --> 02:44:32.969]  Beings who are not fully human.
[02:44:32.969 --> 02:44:34.751]  They will never be able to ever...
[02:44:35.171 --> 02:44:36.252]  Be able to replicate.
[02:44:36.252 --> 02:44:36.752]  Exactly.
[02:44:36.752 --> 02:44:43.136]  He says from a storage thing full of his dad's papers, he's going to resurrect his father.
[02:44:43.136 --> 02:44:46.558]  There is no way Ray Kurzweil is going to resurrect his real father.
[02:44:46.558 --> 02:44:52.942]  He may have a computer that can fool him, and he thinks it's his father, and he says he doesn't believe in God yet.
[02:44:52.942 --> 02:44:54.503]  He's going to be the first God.
[02:44:54.503 --> 02:44:56.164]  I call it the God race.
[02:44:56.164 --> 02:44:57.425]  The race to be God.
[02:44:57.425 --> 02:45:01.568]  And it's as old as the Garden of Eden.
[02:45:01.568 --> 02:45:03.209]  It's as old as the Tower of Babel.
[02:45:03.809 --> 02:45:10.534]  And if we tried to build a new future out of love and compassion and transparency, we might destroy ourselves.
[02:45:10.534 --> 02:45:19.280]  But from this delusional perspective, my concern is, is these people are, they want to control us, but who controls them?
[02:45:19.280 --> 02:45:21.762]  Closing comments, and thank you so much for the time.
[02:45:21.762 --> 02:45:22.662]  I'm going to read the whole book.
[02:45:22.662 --> 02:45:26.765]  I want to get with your publisher and carry it as well in the InfoWars store.
[02:45:26.765 --> 02:45:28.687]  Just another amazing job, Daniel Estlin.
[02:45:28.687 --> 02:45:30.308]  What do you want to leave us with in two minutes?
[02:45:31.226 --> 02:45:37.649]  You know, I just want to go over some of the things that this report, the Strategic Trends 2007-2036 talked about.
[02:45:37.649 --> 02:45:45.712]  They're talking about, by 2015, over 50% of the world's population will be living in urban rather than rural environments.
[02:45:45.712 --> 02:45:47.112]  In one generation, between 2007 and 2036,
[02:45:49.233 --> 02:45:52.476]  The population will go from 7 to 10 billion people.
[02:45:52.476 --> 02:46:01.462]  They're talking in this report about lack of food, water, medicine, proper hygiene, education, and basic human necessities will spell collapse.
[02:46:01.462 --> 02:46:13.912]  And without mincing words, the report states explicitly a growing gap between majority and a small number of highly visible super-rich is likely to cause an increasing threat
[02:46:14.252 --> 02:46:16.173]  to social order and stability.
[02:46:16.173 --> 02:46:26.961]  The result of the growing desperation on the part of humanity will result in civil war, intracommunal violence, insurgency, pervasive criminality, and widespread disorder.
[02:46:26.961 --> 02:46:28.062]  This is from 2005.
[02:46:28.062 --> 02:46:41.572]  Then they talk about that the countries, the nation states, because of the collapse of the global economy and a breakdown of the international political system, these are all terms from the report,
[02:46:42.052 --> 02:46:42.573]  We're good.
[02:47:04.071 --> 02:47:13.280]  Will collapse by the year 2045 and the effect of this collapse will be equivalent to state failure and to endemic failure of the entire human race.
[02:47:13.280 --> 02:47:20.667]  And of course that's the British Ministry of Defense report that you had already gotten a copy of in 2005 that came out what in the Guardian in 2007 or was it?
[02:47:20.667 --> 02:47:21.208]  That's right.
[02:47:22.569 --> 02:47:23.829]  That's right, exactly.
[02:47:23.829 --> 02:47:36.371]  What we had in 2005, when we attended the deliver conference with Jim, our sources gave us the report, not a complete report because it wasn't written at the time, but parts of the report, and we're seeing their agenda on right now and again.
[02:47:36.371 --> 02:47:51.754]  Transhumanism is changing the face of society and people have to become aware that what's around us and what we're about to become in the very near future will be completely different from anything we have ever seen in the history of mankind.
[02:47:51.954 --> 02:47:53.796]  That's right, let me quantify this.
[02:47:53.796 --> 02:47:56.760]  They're scientists, they're doctors, they're technocrats.
[02:47:56.760 --> 02:47:59.383]  The whole world's a laboratory in their own words.
[02:47:59.383 --> 02:48:11.198]  They believe out of this epic struggle in a war against general humanity, in survival of the fittest, they will become gods in the great cyber wars, the great technocrat wars, the biotech wars.
[02:48:11.698 --> 02:48:27.842]  That are to come, they have the underground bases, the redoubts, the supercomputers, and they will then rid the Earth of the scourge of the proto-human as they see us, and they will become, I forget the exact term they use, you know, this sentient, omnipresent, super sapien.
[02:48:27.842 --> 02:48:33.303]  And it is just totally delusional, and in the end of the day, we'll be lucky if they don't destroy the entire planet.
[02:48:33.874 --> 02:48:36.119]  Give me 10 seconds, I'll just have to say this, Alex.
[02:48:36.119 --> 02:48:41.971]  You know, they feel that they have enough technology right now to face the gods and beat them at their own game.
[02:48:41.971 --> 02:48:44.696]  And they feel that they, today, are the gods.
[02:48:45.896 --> 02:48:46.396]  That's right.
[02:48:46.396 --> 02:48:50.359]  They don't let people at Bilderberg look at any of them.
[02:48:50.359 --> 02:48:52.500]  And it just shows their total disconnect.
[02:48:52.500 --> 02:48:57.263]  I talked to so many waiters and waitresses, as you have, after Bilderberg, and they go, we're going to give you all the info.
[02:48:57.263 --> 02:48:57.963]  They were mean to us.
[02:48:57.963 --> 02:48:59.544]  They never gave us tips.
[02:48:59.544 --> 02:49:01.385]  They have no empathy, no humanity.
[02:49:01.385 --> 02:49:03.666]  They want everyone gone, so it's all theirs.
[02:49:03.666 --> 02:49:05.928]  Incredible book, incredible job.
[02:49:05.928 --> 02:49:08.449]  Daniel, you've got to come back more now that we've got you on Skype.
[02:49:08.449 --> 02:49:09.210]  Thank you so much, sir.
[02:49:09.830 --> 02:49:10.811]  God bless you.
[02:49:10.811 --> 02:49:11.291]  God bless you.
[02:49:11.291 --> 02:49:12.372]  Well, I salute Daniel Esselstyn.
[02:49:12.372 --> 02:49:14.793]  That is by far our best interview ever.
[02:49:14.793 --> 02:49:15.494]  Unbelievable.
[02:49:15.494 --> 02:49:23.719]  How do I even come up with a headline good enough to describe how epic these issues are?
[02:49:23.719 --> 02:49:26.942]  I mean, that's why I don't go out to Hollywood anymore when famous people invite me out there.
[02:49:26.942 --> 02:49:28.663]  Why do I care?
[02:49:28.663 --> 02:49:30.864]  That's why I don't care about being on red carpets and stuff.
[02:49:30.864 --> 02:49:31.425]  What does it do?
[02:49:32.640 --> 02:49:38.182]  Only if I could get those people to go public to try to cause an awakening and an understanding.
[02:49:38.182 --> 02:49:42.623]  That's the only reason famous people are important.
[02:49:42.623 --> 02:49:47.745]  You know, I just wish there was a new planet to go to.
[02:49:47.745 --> 02:49:50.126]  But we would carry with us the same seeds of our own destruction.
[02:49:50.126 --> 02:49:51.706]  We've got a battle here.
[02:49:51.706 --> 02:49:52.846]  We've got to go on to the end.
[02:49:56.035 --> 02:50:05.521]  There's nowhere to run in the long run, but it may come down to some people having to go to places that are safer, where they can operate better, where they can have asylum.
[02:50:05.521 --> 02:50:10.924]  But, so many people say, well, it's time for violence.
[02:50:10.924 --> 02:50:16.047]  Defensively, you have a right to defend yourself, and when you're on the right, that's what you gotta do.
[02:50:16.047 --> 02:50:17.488]  I'm not trying to stop you.
[02:50:17.488 --> 02:50:19.649]  Believe me, I'm all about violence.
[02:50:19.649 --> 02:50:20.550]  It's a good friend of mine.
[02:50:21.641 --> 02:50:22.922]  Feels good to stand up.
[02:50:22.922 --> 02:50:23.743]  It feels good to be a man.
[02:50:23.743 --> 02:50:24.844]  It feels good to be strong.
[02:50:24.844 --> 02:50:27.107]  Feels good to not be afraid.
[02:50:27.107 --> 02:50:28.428]  You gotta be smarter than that.
[02:50:28.428 --> 02:50:30.370]  You gotta go to the higher levels of warfare.
[02:50:30.370 --> 02:50:40.100]  You gotta just tell the truth and put the truth out there as a comparison to the other option that is the lie.
[02:50:41.294 --> 02:50:43.375]  This is not a pretty place we're going to.
[02:50:43.375 --> 02:50:44.996]  Look at your children.
[02:50:44.996 --> 02:50:45.896]  Have a debate about it.
[02:50:45.896 --> 02:51:00.584]  And when you go into church and you don't hear this being discussed, and they got Xboxes back there with your kids at Sunday school, and they're doing all this stuff, and they're telling you how great the government is, you're in a government-run den of absolute money-changing devils, and you know what Christ did.
[02:51:02.594 --> 02:51:04.115]  My name is Jessica Armand.
[02:51:04.115 --> 02:51:06.956]  I'm an activist, a GCN listener, and mother of three.
[02:51:06.956 --> 02:51:11.798]  Our drinking water and food are filled with fluoride and other contaminants that harm our teeth and gums.
[02:51:11.798 --> 02:51:17.120]  To protect my family, I created My Magic Mud, an all-natural teeth whitening and strengthening remedy.
[02:51:17.120 --> 02:51:23.843]  My Magic Mud is a soft powder that polishes your teeth, reduces sensitivity, and removes harmful toxins from deep inside your mouth.

[02:52:02.202 --> 02:52:07.106]  The number one secret to having great health and long life is having high levels of glutathione.
[02:52:07.106 --> 02:52:19.115]  This master antioxidant is required by your body to stop free radicals, keep cells young, remove chemical and heavy metal toxins, support immunity, support liver functions, stop inflammation, and much more.
[02:52:19.115 --> 02:52:26.921]  The results of optimal levels of glutathione in your body are more mental and physical energy, stronger immune system, greater endurance, and more.
[02:52:27.501 --> 02:52:33.406]  Do you know the number one secret superfood that helps increase your glutathione levels up to 64% or more?
[02:52:33.406 --> 02:52:37.330]  It's unheated whey protein powder from grass-fed cows.
[02:52:37.330 --> 02:52:42.094]  This health food is amazing in its ability to do so much for virtually everyone.
[02:52:42.094 --> 02:52:48.480]  Introducing One World Whey, an industry-first unheated whey protein powder from grass-fed cows.
[02:52:48.480 --> 02:52:49.181]  Call 888-WHEY-PROTEIN.
[02:52:51.162 --> 02:52:51.822]  988-3325.
[02:52:51.822 --> 02:52:55.184]  That's 888-988-3325.
[02:52:55.184 --> 02:52:57.625]  Or visit OneWorldWay.com.
[02:52:57.625 --> 02:53:01.447]  That's OneWorldW-H-E-Y.com.
[02:53:01.447 --> 02:53:03.829]  It's time for a home security quiz.
[02:53:03.829 --> 02:53:16.836]  What effective home security device is smaller than a coffee cup, fakes out burglars into thinking someone is home at your house while you're away, plugs into any wall outlet, is recommended by many police departments, and sells for less than $30?
[02:53:17.896 --> 02:53:19.817]  Yes, it's fake TV.
[02:53:19.817 --> 02:53:22.018]  This year, about one in every 50 U.S.
[02:53:22.018 --> 02:53:28.422]  homes will have a break-in with burglars usually picking the easy target, a dark house that looks like no one is home.
[02:53:28.422 --> 02:53:36.366]  Fake TV is a small electronic security device that makes it look like someone is home watching TV by simulating the light from a real TV.
[02:53:37.006 --> 02:53:42.710]  Fake TV could be the difference between coming home to a secure house or one that's been ransacked.
[02:53:42.710 --> 02:53:49.595]  To get your fake TV for only $29.95 with free shipping, go to faketv.com or call 1-877-5-FAKE-TV.
[02:53:49.595 --> 02:53:49.875]  That's 877-532-5388.
[02:53:49.875 --> 02:53:50.655]  Or go to faketv.com.
[02:53:50.655 --> 02:53:52.817]  Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[02:54:08.294 --> 02:54:27.341]  Perhaps when these mystery and control freaks look into the panopticon of Datum in a shadow of a shadow, a grain of sand at the beach compared to the mind of God, the Supreme Being, perhaps they'll see how ugly they are spiritually and gain knowledge.
[02:54:27.341 --> 02:54:32.003]  Because they say with great knowledge comes great sorrow for those that are pure of heart
[02:54:32.950 --> 02:54:40.255]  With this great knowledge, is it nothing but a magnifying glass so they can enjoy their crimes against humanity that much more?
[02:54:40.255 --> 02:54:58.127]  You know, my biggest issue is, as I come to full grips with what we face as a civilization, and as a species in our long history, I realize that my life is a flash in the pan, a twinkle in the eye, like the lilies of the field, out, out, brief candle.
[02:54:59.141 --> 02:55:12.890]  But that it is the great struggle of the race to uplift ourselves and become nobler that I am part of and that you are part of and that what matters to me is that we make it to the next level and don't destroy ourselves.
[02:55:12.890 --> 02:55:21.955]  And the greatest crime of the establishment is telling us how bad we are all day, except when the leader comes out, Obama, and then he tells us we're good.
[02:55:22.956 --> 02:55:25.477]  And so we go, oh, he must be good because he's telling us we're good.
[02:55:25.477 --> 02:55:27.078]  I mean, it's disgusting.
[02:55:27.078 --> 02:55:29.118]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[02:55:29.118 --> 02:55:36.601]  And it's like watching a Navy SEAL beat up a newborn baby.
[02:55:36.601 --> 02:55:43.283]  It's like watching an NFL linebacker beat up a one-year-old.
[02:55:43.283 --> 02:55:50.286]  I mean, it's really pathetic that they sit there and abuse these people and then laugh at them.
[02:55:50.286 --> 02:55:50.986]  It's disgusting.
[02:55:53.464 --> 02:56:06.212]  And I personally get to the point up here where trying to run this operation, everything we do, you know, and the way the establishment tries to guilt anyone in new media that tries to fund themselves.
[02:56:06.212 --> 02:56:09.393]  I mean, it's all just mind games, manipulating good people.
[02:56:09.393 --> 02:56:10.734]  And it's time to vote with your dollars.
[02:56:10.734 --> 02:56:16.718]  It's time to spread the word about new sites like InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, DrugsReport.com.
[02:56:16.718 --> 02:56:18.599]  It's such a beacon of liberty.
[02:56:20.054 --> 02:56:27.959]  It's time to really get behind the sources that will talk about the real issues that matter and actually put those on the front of the table.
[02:56:27.959 --> 02:56:34.282]  Our ascension is a great responsibility, but it's only happening because great tyranny is rising.
[02:56:34.282 --> 02:56:35.063]  It's a battle.
[02:56:35.063 --> 02:56:35.843]  It's a war.
[02:56:35.843 --> 02:56:38.605]  It's not a bunch of narcissistic baloney.
[02:56:38.605 --> 02:56:40.766]  It is a struggle.
[02:56:40.766 --> 02:56:46.910]  And you will find in that animating struggle of liberty, that animating contest, you will find your humanity.
[02:56:46.910 --> 02:56:48.231]  And I know you know that, but don't
[02:56:48.931 --> 02:56:53.813]  Don't just take our incredible reports for granted that are on PrisonPlanet.tv and the YouTube channel.
[02:56:53.813 --> 02:56:56.694]  Don't just take the news sites and the articles for granted.
[02:56:56.694 --> 02:56:59.135]  I mean, it is hard work to ever get to this point.
[02:56:59.135 --> 02:57:02.437]  A lot of prayers, a lot of providence.
[02:57:02.437 --> 02:57:03.917]  And I'm telling myself that.
[02:57:03.917 --> 02:57:06.378]  I better appreciate the position I'm in.
[02:57:06.378 --> 02:57:17.583]  I better understand that I can't get... I can't get target fatigue, being so close to this, get acclimated to just how big a situation we're in.
[02:57:18.567 --> 02:57:22.880]  And I do in closing for this hour before Joel Celente comes up, I haven't plugged all day.
[02:57:22.880 --> 02:57:24.224]  We are Lister supported mainly.
[02:57:26.648 --> 02:57:28.949]  And we sell the best products I can find.
[02:57:28.949 --> 02:57:31.571]  The best water filters at the lowest prices.
[02:57:31.571 --> 02:57:33.912]  The Pro Pure and others with promo code water.
[02:57:33.912 --> 02:57:36.653]  The best supplements and the best coffee.
[02:57:36.653 --> 02:57:39.054]  Leg of America coffee from Southern Mexico.
[02:57:39.054 --> 02:57:44.317]  Fluoride Shield with the nascent iodine and the five other ingredients that can be taken with the Survival Shield.
[02:57:44.317 --> 02:57:47.299]  But talk to your physician if you have any issues.
[02:57:47.299 --> 02:57:49.179]  The Life Straws.
[02:57:49.179 --> 02:57:51.741]  We got some combos and some specials running.
[02:57:51.741 --> 02:57:53.041]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:57:53.041 --> 02:57:54.562]  And it is mid-air refueling.
[02:57:54.562 --> 02:57:55.823]  It is buying your war bonds.
[02:57:56.400 --> 02:58:05.083]  And I know you do it out there, but especially those of you that have wealth and know I'm telling the truth, but kind of got where you are because you have an instinct to be selfish.
[02:58:05.083 --> 02:58:06.744]  This is not the time to have that instinct.
[02:58:06.744 --> 02:58:08.385]  That was in the old system before we fell.
[02:58:09.418 --> 02:58:25.583]  We're going into a very dangerous time where if you're not all in, and don't spread the word about this broadcast, and don't become PrisonPlanet.tv members and share memberships, if you don't buy the products at InfowarsLife.com, I need a lot more money to be secure, to be strong in the face of the enemy.
[02:58:25.583 --> 02:58:26.343]  I need good armor.
[02:58:26.923 --> 02:58:30.866]  I need good systems to project the truth at the enemy.
[02:58:30.866 --> 02:58:32.888]  I need weapons in the InfoWars.
[02:58:32.888 --> 02:58:37.711]  And I need you to fill our war chest at InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com, or 888-253-3139.
