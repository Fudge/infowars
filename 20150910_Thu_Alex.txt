[00:00.000 --> 00:11.760]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.760 --> 00:19.320]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.320 --> 00:30.480]  Texas Alex Jones four years ago when the West backed by NATO went into Libya
[00:30.480 --> 00:34.500]  overthrew it and turned the country over to Al Qaeda and Saudi Arabian back
[00:34.500 --> 00:39.680]  groups we predicted we'd start seeing Jihad attacks in the West threats to
[00:39.680 --> 00:45.040]  shoot down jetliners with these stolen stinger missiles and more what I didn't
[00:45.040 --> 00:52.520]  expect with the Wahhabist globalist shadow armies was for them to then have
[00:52.520 --> 00:59.320]  them lead giant exoduses out of North Africa the Middle East and other areas
[00:59.320 --> 01:05.320]  in through Turkey who then shuttles every one of the borders of Eastern and
[01:05.320 --> 01:12.040]  Western Europe I mean that is so bold and then to have the media with a
[01:12.040 --> 01:17.160]  straight face in unison from the UK to Germany to France to Sweden to Canada to
[01:17.160 --> 01:23.400]  the US to say it's our job to take millions of people it's your job to
[01:23.400 --> 01:31.800]  pay for it the West is evil we need to pay for everything and then Donald Trump
[01:31.800 --> 01:36.800]  comes out two days ago and says yeah we got to take a Merkel's doing a great
[01:36.800 --> 01:45.760]  job he's since backpedaled and we have that video that we're going to be playing
[01:45.760 --> 01:49.400]  here in fact I know you gave it to me but can I have another video list I can't
[01:49.400 --> 01:54.560]  find it thank you and that ties into this story that's the top story on
[01:54.560 --> 02:02.560]  info wars.com hashtag winning 50 spies go public blow the whistle and report on
[02:02.560 --> 02:08.720]  ISIS they say that ISIS is being basically protected that the reports are
[02:08.720 --> 02:13.520]  being altered by higher ups they're fixing the intelligence to claim that
[02:13.520 --> 02:20.800]  ISIS isn't spreading or that ISIS isn't run by the West absolutely ISIS is run
[02:20.800 --> 02:26.600]  by the West and Julian Assange has now put out the documents which I wish you
[02:26.600 --> 02:31.960]  done years ago that before the Arab Spring was launched by the West and by
[02:31.960 --> 02:36.840]  the Obama administration to put radical Islamists in everywhere and then flood
[02:36.840 --> 02:45.600]  Europe we now see the full master plan that if you go back they were planning
[02:45.600 --> 02:51.040]  the top of Assad using al-Qaeda grips even before that and that is now been
[02:51.040 --> 02:56.200]  released by WikiLeaks I mean you can just see the full garment now the full
[02:56.200 --> 03:02.320]  cut of it and it's now on the runway fully animated we now see their full
[03:02.320 --> 03:11.440]  plan truly diabolical beyond the James Bond movie and all admitted but the
[03:11.440 --> 03:17.640]  public is so unconscionably politically economically culturally
[03:17.640 --> 03:23.800]  illiterate we have no culture well they sure got us on the hook with John Wayne
[03:23.800 --> 03:28.920]  and I love Lucy and stuff like that and then once we had the you know public on
[03:28.920 --> 03:34.960]  the hook we were going down the rat hole because once that unfolded it was
[03:34.960 --> 03:42.400]  basically over the sky was the limit once once the hook was in our mouth
[03:42.400 --> 03:47.440]  sure a worms big and juicy and nutritious if you're a bass or a perch or a
[03:47.440 --> 03:53.160]  catfish but once you bite into that worm you find out there's cold hard steel
[03:53.160 --> 03:57.600]  the big barb on the end and it goes right through your lip right underneath
[03:57.600 --> 04:01.520]  your jaw and you're caught and then you're hauled up into a whole nother
[04:01.520 --> 04:08.440]  atmosphere a whole nother world and you're on the dinner table and I look
[04:08.440 --> 04:12.520]  at the public raised by television didn't have parents that were in the
[04:12.520 --> 04:15.960]  geopolitics didn't have parents into history didn't have parents that took
[04:15.960 --> 04:21.320]  them places and educated them they have no culture these are empty hollow men and
[04:21.320 --> 04:27.440]  women and into that emptiness they now pour total racism everyone hating each
[04:27.440 --> 04:33.240]  other attacks on language as if language is evil itself just total cult
[04:33.240 --> 04:44.440]  in sock 1984 over-the-top brainwashing except 1984 is a book this is real I
[04:44.440 --> 04:50.280]  mean it is so diabolical and the globalists will keep doing it as long
[04:50.280 --> 04:58.440]  as they think they're immune from justice no one is immune from justice
[04:58.440 --> 05:03.600]  ISIS has demanded that Syrian Christians pay an Islam tax this is
[05:03.600 --> 05:08.240]  being reported by WorldNet daily ISIS terrorists gather together dozens of
[05:08.240 --> 05:12.480]  Christian men in Syria and told them either to pay a Sharia inspired tax and
[05:12.480 --> 05:16.560]  sign on to a list of faith-based restrictions or pay a penalty that
[05:16.560 --> 05:21.080]  could include the loss of life among the restrictions Christians cannot own
[05:21.080 --> 05:26.360]  guns build places of worship show their crosses in public or even ring church
[05:26.360 --> 05:30.440]  bells the terrorists put forth their demands to Christians in a town that
[05:30.440 --> 05:34.560]  used to be dominated by the Christian faith but has been taken over by radical
[05:34.560 --> 05:39.640]  Muslims and while many followers of Islam will condemn these actions numerous
[05:39.640 --> 05:44.360]  people in power continue to fund groups like ISIS and al-Qaeda whether it's
[05:44.360 --> 05:48.400]  air-dropping grenades or leaving behind billions of dollars worth of vehicles
[05:48.400 --> 05:51.960]  that they can use against us these terrorist groups always seem to find

[08:30.000 --> 08:38.240]  Friday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central we're here live broadcasting worldwide
[08:38.240 --> 08:45.240]  there's a big article in Politico today breaking down the metrics from a bunch
[08:45.240 --> 08:51.320]  of different ratings systems including Google that Matt drudges drudge report
[08:51.320 --> 08:58.560]  calm is the number one news and political website in the world even ahead
[08:58.560 --> 09:06.040]  of Facebook calm and all of its billions more than two billion people
[09:06.040 --> 09:11.440]  regularly use Facebook but it's all atomized it's all fractured I mean we're
[09:11.440 --> 09:15.240]  able to reach three million people a day on Facebook with our eight different
[09:15.240 --> 09:19.520]  Facebook platforms that volunteers made for a six seven years ago whatever at
[09:19.520 --> 09:29.880]  first came out and then hand it over to us but imagine being the number one news
[09:29.880 --> 09:38.400]  destination political destination in the world even bigger than Facebook
[09:39.240 --> 09:47.600]  Matt drudge Mark Zuckerberg drudge report editor Facebook CEO and it just goes
[09:47.600 --> 09:54.040]  into the fact that basically drudge is continuing to expand his domination and
[09:54.040 --> 09:59.480]  then they don't even count his Twitter accounts or other things he does now you
[09:59.480 --> 10:04.760]  notice though if you listen to people at media matters run by the White House
[10:04.760 --> 10:10.000]  that almost has no viewers and readers but it doesn't matter because then the
[10:10.000 --> 10:15.040]  entire controlled media picks up their talking points and regurgitates it so
[10:15.040 --> 10:19.640]  yeah some talking point that you know the other globalist email down doesn't
[10:19.640 --> 10:24.400]  itself on the printout have a big audience but once it's put out there to
[10:24.400 --> 10:30.360]  be regurgitated and repeated it is important they of course are running
[10:30.360 --> 10:35.400]  around saying Matt drudge has no viewers Matt drudge is dead Matt drudge has
[10:35.400 --> 10:40.960]  lost his importance Matt drudge is over and this is a tactic that I see out of
[10:40.960 --> 10:47.320]  dinosaur media against us every day Alex is a cook info war is a stupid
[10:47.320 --> 10:52.840]  nobody reads it nobody likes it it's all over they don't have any success ha ha
[10:52.840 --> 11:03.880]  this is the tactics of a dying system our readership our viewership our
[11:03.880 --> 11:09.040]  listenership is growing exponentially by every metric and so what do they do they
[11:09.040 --> 11:13.600]  have amazon.com democratic party run controlled Alexa one of the main
[11:13.600 --> 11:20.000]  rating services come out a year ago and lower the rating 70 percent across the
[11:20.000 --> 11:25.760]  board of world net daily drudge report.com info wars.com and any other
[11:25.760 --> 11:30.160]  libertarian website they didn't really do it the mainline Republican sites they
[11:30.160 --> 11:34.040]  did it to activist sites that are popular and dominating well guess what
[11:34.040 --> 11:38.200]  you're just not in this political article now as a metric it doesn't matter
[11:38.200 --> 11:45.320]  if you claim that Mike Tyson in his prime wasn't the top heavyweight contender
[11:45.320 --> 11:51.520]  he was it doesn't matter if you change metrics overnight and then just declare
[11:51.520 --> 11:57.160]  we have no visitors when it's not true and the reason I started the whole
[11:57.160 --> 12:01.440]  broadcast with this today is because if you understand this and how these hoaxes
[12:01.440 --> 12:07.360]  and frauds work it's all over they're tripling down and quadrupling down on
[12:07.360 --> 12:20.080]  their bravada arrogance hutzpah hubris filled dribble because they're desperate
[12:20.080 --> 12:30.620]  every major establishment media platform already hemorrhaged out and big
[12:30.620 --> 12:35.080]  globalist insider corporations fat-off banker bailouts and government
[12:35.080 --> 12:40.680]  contracts are propping them up because they don't want the embarrassment of
[12:40.680 --> 12:48.480]  admitting they're already dead it's like national ampoules vacation where they
[12:48.480 --> 12:53.400]  act like the aunt Edna is still alive and she's not what's that movie only saw
[12:53.400 --> 12:56.680]  part of it weekend at bernie's or something where they got the dead body
[12:56.680 --> 13:01.160]  in their home and around I mean that's what they're doing is propping up dead
[13:01.160 --> 13:08.680]  bodies propping up a dead dinosaur but it smells it stinks it's oozing they're
[13:08.680 --> 13:13.680]  spewing talking points you can see the failure in their eyes the only power of
[13:13.680 --> 13:19.120]  the zombie horde has is when they get their talking points if they all in
[13:19.120 --> 13:23.560]  unison push a hoax and then get entertainment media pushing it as well
[13:23.560 --> 13:27.560]  and get the movies pushing it as well and get the video games pushing it and
[13:27.560 --> 13:34.120]  every other platform then they can get the dumbest of the sheeple the most
[13:34.120 --> 13:41.800]  dumb-down drooling unaware unconscious slugs to adopt what they're saying and
[13:41.800 --> 13:48.080]  to go out and repeat it but new media is the comment coming to kill the
[13:48.080 --> 13:56.560]  dinosaurs and the comment already hit they're dead already politically but
[13:56.560 --> 14:01.620]  here's the problem they're transcending politics and just going to pure
[14:01.620 --> 14:06.120]  psych warfare 2 plus 2 equals 5 you didn't build your business if we raise the
[14:06.120 --> 14:08.960]  debt ceiling it doesn't raise the debt people say that's ridiculous that's
[14:08.960 --> 14:14.880]  discrediting no it's not when you've got a zombie constituency they've got new
[14:14.880 --> 14:18.520]  studies out that many people aren't even wiping their butts now so I was going to
[14:18.520 --> 14:22.080]  be sarcastic and say these are people that can't even wipe their their own
[14:22.080 --> 14:29.000]  rear-ends they literally can't their constituents believe 2 plus 2 equals
[14:29.000 --> 14:34.600]  5 their constituents say ban the Bible on the street in unison when they're
[14:34.600 --> 14:38.120]  asked we played that a couple days ago in fact cue that back up I want to play
[14:38.120 --> 14:41.760]  that that's so powerful we're gonna go out in Austin and show that as well we
[14:41.760 --> 14:47.280]  can duplicate it in any trendy area all these people have is arrogance that
[14:47.280 --> 14:54.520]  they're part of the ruling class when they're not so that's all they have is
[14:54.520 --> 14:59.760]  a hoax the problem is they're moving towards the
[14:59.760 --> 15:04.120]  talitarianism because they're losing the political debate they're moving
[15:04.120 --> 15:10.520]  towards autocratic technocratic centralized command and control and
[15:10.520 --> 15:18.440]  they've got enough people that are awake but choose to join with Surin with the
[15:18.440 --> 15:24.080]  emperor with the devil with whatever that archetype is in your mind that's
[15:24.080 --> 15:29.240]  why we're in so much trouble is there are collaborators who don't even care if
[15:29.240 --> 15:34.560]  this system's pure evil they are going to choose to prey on the dumb mass and
[15:34.560 --> 15:40.240]  join the predator class even though it's dishonorable it's disreputable it's
[15:40.240 --> 15:45.840]  destructive and in their hearts they know they're going to be destroyed in the
[15:45.840 --> 15:49.360]  end by it but so many globalists tell me it doesn't matter I'm going to be
[15:49.360 --> 15:57.800]  winning until that happens and it's because they're cowards and there's so
[15:57.800 --> 16:02.640]  many evil people and sociopaths that didn't promote good even though they
[16:02.640 --> 16:07.480]  could have gotten more power out of choosing good because inherently they
[16:07.480 --> 16:13.560]  don't want to be good I mean in a world of sellouts in a world of idiots in a
[16:13.560 --> 16:21.720]  world of parasites in a world of predators being a white knight is king
[16:21.720 --> 16:27.080]  I am a moral person I love justice that's why I chose my path I didn't do it to be
[16:27.080 --> 16:32.720]  famous I didn't do it to be rich I only expanded my operation and tried to gain
[16:32.720 --> 16:38.560]  some wealth to be able to defend myself because I was criticized for imaginary
[16:38.560 --> 16:43.800]  wealth ten years ago I didn't have I knew rotically like the purest white
[16:43.800 --> 16:48.800]  night you can imagine spent 98% of the money coming in and lived in a very
[16:48.800 --> 16:53.880]  humble home and drove a very humble car until people accused me of doing all
[16:53.880 --> 17:00.080]  this for money and I said I'll show you money and now I had enemies lined up to
[17:00.080 --> 17:06.600]  the sun great attack me we have some backup we have some depth we have some
[17:06.600 --> 17:12.960]  strength against the storms you build a lighthouse on the strong parapet of natural
[17:12.960 --> 17:19.360]  rock and they lecture us knowing we're Christian knowing we're good you didn't
[17:19.360 --> 17:22.640]  take enough immigrants you didn't pay for enough anchor babies how dare a
[17:22.640 --> 17:27.960]  libertarian group or conservative group sell a book how dare how dare world net
[17:27.960 --> 17:32.960]  daily sell books how dare Matt Drudge have advertising how dare how dare how
[17:32.960 --> 17:40.120]  dare while they have taxpayer money at NPR and taxpayer money in it MSNBC while
[17:40.120 --> 17:46.160]  they suck off of us at gunpoint they sit there and try to lecture us that we
[17:46.160 --> 17:52.480]  shouldn't ever build our own media last year they sued and got the thousands of
[17:52.480 --> 17:55.280]  pages of documents I want to get Joseph Farrell back on because so much of it was
[17:55.280 --> 18:00.040]  so incendiary he didn't even know if he could release at all from the Clinton
[18:00.040 --> 18:06.200]  library in Arkansas and it was all in the early 90s before drudge existed a
[18:06.200 --> 18:10.440]  few years before when world net daily was going online as the Western
[18:10.440 --> 18:14.760]  Journalism Center they were scared of Farrah and they were scared of independent
[18:14.760 --> 18:18.520]  films like Jeremiah films the Clinton Chronicles and they're talking about how
[18:18.520 --> 18:22.520]  do we shut down new media it'll be conservative it'll be libertarian it'll
[18:22.520 --> 18:26.960]  be liberal we won't control it we've got to demonize it we've got to audit it
[18:26.960 --> 18:30.440]  we've got to shut it down we've got to call a conspiracy theorist I mean if an
[18:30.440 --> 18:35.280]  independent meteorological group started and said that you know they thought
[18:35.280 --> 18:39.320]  rain was coming they'd call a conspiracy theory it's a way to shut down any
[18:39.320 --> 18:44.240]  intellectual debate that they don't control and you can read the whole thing
[18:44.240 --> 18:49.120]  right there because they knew then if they allowed an open free market of
[18:49.120 --> 18:54.600]  ideas that would be the end of them I mean who wants some old criminal witch
[18:54.600 --> 19:03.160]  like Hillary Clinton who really likes John Boehner that burnout idiot who

[24:20.200 --> 24:22.920]  play that clip since I mentioned it because we played it in overdrive a
[24:22.920 --> 24:29.480]  couple days ago of almost every person well-spoking a lot of older liberal
[24:29.480 --> 24:36.360]  types white people mainly saying let's ban the Bible ban the sale of the Bible
[24:36.360 --> 24:43.480]  and it just shows what a cult of authoritarians these people are they
[24:43.480 --> 24:49.320]  have us be tolerant of them until they get into control and then they become
[24:49.320 --> 24:54.520]  as totalitarian as North Korea and anywhere you put collectivist in
[24:54.520 --> 25:01.080]  control you end up in a hellish North Korea slash Stalinist gulag with a
[25:01.080 --> 25:05.160]  little potbellied nobodies with submachine guns ruling over you while
[25:05.160 --> 25:11.520]  you starve to death because that's what they produce and again you've got big
[25:11.520 --> 25:15.640]  major corporations that get government bailouts funding the major mainstream
[25:15.640 --> 25:20.600]  media propping up the facade billions in bailout money going to NBC general
[25:20.600 --> 25:26.680]  electric hundreds of millions going into MSNBC of taxpayer money 400 and
[25:26.680 --> 25:30.560]  something million a year to NPR for decades billions going into Planned
[25:30.560 --> 25:34.240]  Parenthood all of it and then what do they always sit around and lecture off
[25:34.240 --> 25:39.680]  the Clinton talking points from 1993 that were given to the media this is in
[25:39.680 --> 25:45.800]  the Clinton Foundation it's come out the Clinton Library that's a bigger deal
[25:45.800 --> 25:50.540]  than what world that really even made of it and Farrah said some of it was so
[25:50.540 --> 25:53.440]  damning he was scared to release it I want to see it released a year later
[25:53.440 --> 25:58.000]  that call Farrah really tell them I want to come on the show please and I want
[25:58.000 --> 26:00.760]  to know what else is in there because what was in there was bad enough what
[26:00.760 --> 26:04.760]  they released a small part of it was how they would shape the media how they
[26:04.760 --> 26:08.680]  would shut down new media how they would control information well guess what
[26:08.680 --> 26:17.000]  Hillary it may have taken 25 years but you failed your highness you failed
[26:17.000 --> 26:24.520]  miserably and the fact that what two or three people run drudge it's pointed out
[26:24.520 --> 26:28.120]  you can tell when drudge is on vacation because it's not as good then when
[26:28.120 --> 26:33.680]  he's doing it not knocking his other guys it's just that he's the guru of what
[26:33.680 --> 26:40.320]  he does so three people run something that reaches more people with news and
[26:40.320 --> 26:48.640]  politics than Facebook that's number two that has been valued at over 100
[26:48.640 --> 26:58.160]  billion dollars a 100 billion dollar operation cannot counter three people
[26:58.160 --> 27:07.240]  because the truth and not that any of us are infallible not that any of us have
[27:07.240 --> 27:11.840]  all the answers but that we're trying to tell the truth and the will to tell the
[27:11.840 --> 27:15.440]  truth trumps the fraud and by the way they had a hundred billion dollar stock
[27:15.440 --> 27:19.280]  offering at first I was being conservative they just fact-checked me I'm
[27:19.280 --> 27:22.720]  sorry people think I exaggerate nine times out of ten it's the opposite
[27:22.720 --> 27:31.800]  Facebook is now worth more than Walmart 245 billion dollars thank you for
[27:31.800 --> 27:38.840]  correcting me almost two and a half times more value so it's worth 245
[27:38.840 --> 27:45.800]  billion dollars and I've seen the drudge report valued in different news
[27:45.800 --> 27:51.960]  articles for 50 to 100 million just because of the influence so you got
[27:51.960 --> 27:57.920]  something with three people that trumps something with tens of thousands of
[27:57.920 --> 28:03.480]  people 245 billion see my brain just automatically goes the lowest number I
[28:03.480 --> 28:07.520]  know so that I'm not exaggerating it's a neurotic thing I do and because of it I
[28:07.520 --> 28:11.000]  wanted to say it was worth over 200 billion I just went from memory what I
[28:11.000 --> 28:13.240]  thought was safe they check everything I say
[28:13.240 --> 28:17.440]  neurotically usually it's right I was wrong there's another example of where I
[28:17.440 --> 28:21.560]  knew it was worth 200 plus billion I was gonna say 240 plus billion and I just
[28:21.560 --> 28:25.000]  went ahead and dialed back to their initial stock offering of what six seven
[28:25.000 --> 28:28.880]  years ago or whatever it was five years ago of 100 billion but I'm kind of
[28:28.880 --> 28:34.440]  digressing people want this teleprompter free somebody trying to tell them the
[28:34.440 --> 28:41.360]  truth somebody busting their butt to be accurate versus someone saying when you
[28:41.360 --> 28:48.080]  raise the debt limit that didn't raise the debt well yes it does I don't care
[28:48.080 --> 28:52.880]  if you're part black and I'm racist because I say you're a liar you are a
[28:52.880 --> 28:58.880]  liar Barack Obama and your race card doesn't work anymore it may work on the
[28:58.880 --> 29:02.560]  sheeple it may work on the lemmings but here's the difference
[29:02.560 --> 29:08.680]  lemmings don't produce lemmings are a joke and it's the thinkers it's the
[29:08.680 --> 29:13.760]  builders it's the inventors it's the fighters that will never submit to you
[29:13.760 --> 29:22.640]  and 5% of Liberty lovers will defeat the giant mass of drooling morons that are
[29:22.640 --> 29:29.040]  your servants and so that's what it comes down to so you want to be allied
[29:29.040 --> 29:32.900]  with new automated smart grids that control everything and your central
[29:32.900 --> 29:38.320]  systems and robots as if that is going to finally give you the armies you need
[29:38.320 --> 29:43.280]  to defeat good good only rises when you get the upper hand and you're about to
[29:43.280 --> 29:48.840]  have your political arms ripped out of their sockets news is coming up we're

[29:59.040 --> 30:05.240]  schools in Germany are ordering teenage girls not to wear miniskirts or shorts
[30:05.240 --> 30:10.560]  as to avoid offending Muslim immigrants parents were warned that their
[30:10.560 --> 30:15.600]  children should not wear revealing clothes for fear of misunderstandings
[30:15.600 --> 30:21.360]  that could lead to attacks by the migrants children were also told that
[30:21.360 --> 30:27.400]  derogatory or racial remarks will not be tolerated the letter was actually sent
[30:27.400 --> 30:32.120]  out at the end of June but it is drawing fresh attention in the light of
[30:32.120 --> 30:38.240]  Germany's plan to accept 800,000 new migrants before the end of the year and
[30:38.240 --> 30:44.720]  500,000 a year for the foreseeable future info wars has been contacted by

[33:29.400 --> 33:35.560]  so it is a facade the liberals are not liberals they are social engineer
[33:35.560 --> 33:42.640]  eugenicist control freaks it's military camouflage they are scientifically
[33:42.640 --> 33:48.200]  focused very wicked anti-human people their operatives control the republican
[33:48.200 --> 33:57.240]  party as well our job is to expose these enemies and when I say enemies I say
[33:57.240 --> 34:02.320]  that before God Almighty I'm very careful about who I attack I'm very
[34:02.320 --> 34:06.400]  careful about who I judge and I know for a fact the people that run the
[34:06.400 --> 34:11.800]  Democratic Party are willful organized crime criminals that hate you and your
[34:11.800 --> 34:16.320]  family and who are eugenicist and who are narcotics traffickers and child
[34:16.320 --> 34:22.560]  snuff film purveyors and the worst murdering filth you can imagine they
[34:22.560 --> 34:30.520]  are beyond serial killers they want to wreck everything good they want to wreck
[34:30.520 --> 34:35.360]  free market they want you poor they want to abort you before you're born they
[34:35.360 --> 34:40.120]  want to inject you with deadly vaccines they want to suck you dry before they
[34:40.120 --> 34:48.520]  kill you basically they're an army of satanist and again I don't mince words
[34:48.520 --> 34:57.960]  there there is not rhetoric that will rise to the level of how bad they are
[35:03.920 --> 35:08.560]  my mom's brother who died last year would never tell me Vietnam stories even
[35:08.560 --> 35:11.360]  though he'd been shot down seven times how he decorated his main job was
[35:11.360 --> 35:16.520]  delivering special forces trips it'll be a helicopter and I'd always ask him to
[35:16.520 --> 35:20.240]  tell me stories when I was a kid and he finally when I was a teenager said fine
[35:20.240 --> 35:26.200]  I'll tell you stories the smell of rotten flesh all the time all the blood and
[35:26.200 --> 35:30.400]  stuff would get in the helicopters and get down in the gears and get down in
[35:30.400 --> 35:34.720]  their bellies and when you land helicopters there'd be the smell of
[35:34.720 --> 35:38.520]  rotten flesh and there'd be dead bodies of men women and children laying around
[35:38.520 --> 35:41.360]  bloating on the sun
[35:43.560 --> 35:47.280]  he goes you've heard enough it's not fancy it's not fun it's not cool I
[35:47.280 --> 35:50.680]  remember getting old World War two vats that were friends with my grandfather
[35:50.680 --> 35:54.240]  who would let them you know hunt on our property every year on the first day of
[35:54.240 --> 35:58.720]  deer season right after Thanksgiving there'd be like 20 30 old World War two
[35:58.720 --> 36:02.920]  vats and over the years they all died they were all so cool and fun to talk to
[36:02.920 --> 36:06.000]  but I'll always tell me a World War two story tell me a World War two story and
[36:06.000 --> 36:11.400]  they very rarely tell me any stories but one of them was telling me yeah the
[36:11.400 --> 36:14.680]  worst part was it wasn't just that the Nazis had forced labor camps and death
[36:14.680 --> 36:19.440]  camps but millions of Germans were starving to death every month or so
[36:19.440 --> 36:23.520]  there at the end of the war 20 million Germans died about half of them
[36:23.520 --> 36:27.480]  starving to death and they would have them once they'd taken an area just
[36:27.480 --> 36:33.200]  bulldoze dead bodies as far as the eye could see with blackbirds eating the
[36:33.200 --> 36:37.760]  flesh off the bones and they said it was the smell of rotten meat no matter
[36:37.760 --> 36:43.760]  where you were the smell of the dying people the smell of their rotting bodies
[36:43.760 --> 36:50.240]  and having to drag them around all day and bulldoze them into big piles and
[36:50.240 --> 36:55.240]  another one another vet Elmer Nebels I was bugging him he was cooking gravy for
[36:55.240 --> 36:59.160]  biscuits at like 4 30 in the morning because I was gonna ride with him get an
[36:59.160 --> 37:02.360]  old van he'd take off road to these gullies and stuff that he had all
[37:02.360 --> 37:07.440]  rigged up with big tires he goes you want to hear a story where his part was
[37:07.440 --> 37:12.560]  killing beautiful women you know like your mama your mama's a real pretty
[37:12.560 --> 37:17.080]  blonde well they'd send them out there look like Marilyn Monroe and they'd
[37:17.080 --> 37:24.440]  open up a fur coat and pull a machine gun out and I cut them in half and little
[37:24.440 --> 37:29.680]  kids you're sitting there he was now you done asking those questions he was a
[37:29.680 --> 37:33.720]  sweet old guy till I kept pestering to tell me a World War two story and I
[37:33.720 --> 37:37.840]  learned really quick don't ask the World War two stories
[37:41.240 --> 37:46.240]  and now we're in this modern world where the bodies aren't all rotting out in
[37:46.240 --> 37:51.080]  front of us with thousands of birds eating their bodies like something out of
[37:51.080 --> 37:57.360]  Hellraiser it's done through vaccines and through fluoride and through GMOs and
[37:57.360 --> 38:00.440]  the doctors are compartmentalized they're not part of it and you bring your
[38:00.440 --> 38:04.040]  little kid in and they get the shots they have convulsions 20 years later
[38:04.040 --> 38:09.800]  they're soft killed in diapers you know the way the globalist hit us we never
[38:09.800 --> 38:14.400]  know what hits it kills us 10 years later 20 years later it's so funny to
[38:14.400 --> 38:22.040]  them they're laughing they enjoy that they're in on it the ruling establishment
[38:22.040 --> 38:32.680]  knows they poisoned you and your family they like it they want to hurt you and
[38:32.680 --> 38:38.720]  they've got huge armies of people because mark dies we used to do these
[38:38.720 --> 38:42.400]  videos showing dumb liberals who aren't really liberals he started doing in
[38:42.400 --> 38:46.160]  California we went out there in the very same areas last year and duplicated
[38:46.160 --> 38:51.080]  with our reporters we do it in Austin and get pretty much the same response we
[38:51.080 --> 38:54.480]  get seven out of ten saying put gun owners in forced labor camps and kill
[38:54.480 --> 39:00.560]  us or ban Christianity he gets eight or nine out of ten to do it and let me
[39:00.560 --> 39:04.040]  explain something to you I can walk pretty much anywhere in Austin near the
[39:04.040 --> 39:08.120]  university or a trendy area and they will say put gun owners in slave camps
[39:08.120 --> 39:12.240]  they're ready to do it now if I go to a blue collar area with a bunch of work
[39:12.240 --> 39:15.680]  trucks with a bunch of guys that are plumbers black white Hispanic you name
[39:15.680 --> 39:21.080]  it they'll say how about you get out here before we kick your butt buddy or we
[39:21.080 --> 39:24.840]  have a right to own guns in this country the people working know what's going on
[39:24.840 --> 39:29.560]  you go in a wealthy area there'll be lots crazy we have a second amendment but
[39:29.560 --> 39:35.960]  you go to the trendy areas with all the know-it-alls these people are dangerous
[39:35.960 --> 39:42.720]  that's what I'm getting it they'll take everything we've got they'll suck it out
[39:42.720 --> 39:47.160]  of us and never think twice but here's the difference they're never gonna reach
[39:47.160 --> 39:51.800]  the promised land they're just the dumb idiots helping sell things down the
[39:51.800 --> 39:56.200]  rattle when the globalists come to full power they're the first people that are
[39:56.200 --> 40:03.160]  gonna be on the chopping block so the New World Order social engineers have been
[40:03.160 --> 40:06.880]  real good at hiding a lot of their evil behind the scenes but all of that is now
[40:06.880 --> 40:12.760]  coming to a close and everything's starting to unravel and it can't be hidden
[40:12.760 --> 40:16.400]  anymore and that's why they're trying to accelerate their program because they're
[40:16.400 --> 40:22.160]  behind schedule shall be happy in our discontent be happy in our problems
[40:22.160 --> 40:28.440]  because it's like when you get the flu and you're throwing up your body's
[40:28.440 --> 40:32.760]  getting the virus out your body's emptying out you're gonna get better
[40:32.760 --> 40:36.680]  that high fever is gonna burn through that virus and we have to go through
[40:36.680 --> 40:41.600]  this and we're here warning people as the shock troops saying the stuff nobody
[40:41.600 --> 40:47.680]  will say because the attack is so big so evil so calculated so over the top that
[40:47.680 --> 40:52.560]  they know the average wholesome person can't deal with it can't process it
[40:52.560 --> 40:59.640]  because it's so over the top and so diabolical it's my job to be attacked to
[40:59.640 --> 41:05.280]  be demonized to be taken out of context because I know that everything we talk
[41:05.280 --> 41:09.120]  about is going to start unfolding so much of it already has sixty seventy
[41:09.120 --> 41:13.960]  percent already has and so now the ridicule doesn't work now the ridicules
[41:13.960 --> 41:22.840]  a red badge of honor it's the mark of courage it's the blood of victory
[41:26.240 --> 41:30.800]  how many people that are establishment folks get the word their ten year old's
[41:30.800 --> 41:37.600]  got cancer that'll wake you up real fast how many cops you think wake up in big
[41:37.600 --> 41:40.680]  cities where they get briefings that veterans and gun owners are the enemy
[41:40.680 --> 41:45.080]  and the feds expect a civil war with gun confiscation you think that wakes the
[41:45.080 --> 41:48.280]  police up when they get called in and get told that and then the founding
[41:48.280 --> 41:57.480]  fathers are badmouthed in major cities across the country now if we wouldn't
[41:57.480 --> 42:00.040]  have warned them that was coming beforehand they wouldn't have gotten this
[42:00.040 --> 42:05.440]  freaked out maybe but now they know the rest of the agenda attached to it so now
[42:05.440 --> 42:08.840]  they've got to be prepared for destruction when the establishment tries
[42:08.840 --> 42:14.080]  to take over don't think the globalists don't have big computer algorithm
[42:14.080 --> 42:18.480]  diagram actuaries of exactly what your department's made up of and who you
[42:18.480 --> 42:25.160]  stand for and what you're going to do you've been marked by hardcore criminals
[42:25.160 --> 42:29.600]  for extermination and we're just here giving you the heads up because we're
[42:29.600 --> 42:33.600]  all in the same boat together whether we admit that or not that if they try to
[42:33.600 --> 42:37.360]  pull that hammer if they drop that hammer that hammer dropping is going to
[42:37.360 --> 42:41.560]  destroy them because we're not going to be caught flat-footed we're ready and
[42:41.560 --> 42:46.760]  we know what's going on and we've done everything we can in a wholesome way to
[42:46.760 --> 42:53.800]  try to stop this we have been defending peace
[42:53.800 --> 43:02.880]  by preparing for war while we have been warning and offensively getting the
[43:02.880 --> 43:06.840]  word out and digging in at the same time
[43:10.120 --> 43:16.280]  and if the establishment is crazy enough to make a full hot move their cold
[43:16.280 --> 43:23.640]  wars failing against the patriots of the world it'll be a bridge too far it'll
[43:23.640 --> 43:32.320]  be a touch too much and it'll be the end of their new world order dead on
[43:32.320 --> 43:40.840]  arrival and so we are here affecting the current near future and future
[43:40.840 --> 43:49.040]  sociological space the battle space and knowing you're under attack is half the
[43:49.040 --> 43:52.960]  battle and by the way that's not from GI Joe that's an old army saying that they
[43:52.960 --> 43:58.760]  put in the cartoon knowing who the enemy is knowing where they are knowing who
[43:58.760 --> 44:04.880]  they are knowing how they operate is half the battle the rest of the battle is
[44:04.880 --> 44:10.840]  simply pointing out we're the good guys you're the bad guys fundamentally at a
[44:10.840 --> 44:16.280]  gut level everybody knows that they know evil's rising they know it's coming
[44:16.280 --> 44:25.240]  after the people and they've got a army probably 30% of the public that are
[44:25.240 --> 44:30.360]  totalitarians that are selfish that are weak that are pathetic who think it's
[44:30.360 --> 44:35.360]  cool to ban the Bible who think it's cool to arrest gun owners who think it's
[44:35.360 --> 44:40.040]  cool to forcibly abort babies who think it's cool they think by submitting to
[44:40.040 --> 44:46.800]  the system they gain power that's how pathetic they are now coming up poll
[44:46.800 --> 44:51.160]  Donald Trump surges 33% support Bernie Sanders overtakes Hillary Clinton in
[44:51.160 --> 44:57.960]  Iowa the Pope meeting secretly with John Boehner Saudi Arabia has 100,000
[44:57.960 --> 45:01.680]  air-conditioned tents that can house 3 million people sitting empty yet has
[45:01.680 --> 45:05.640]  taken zero refugees but nobody's gonna criticize them because the Saudi Royal
[45:05.640 --> 45:14.960]  House has brown skin so if they go cause the wars that cause the refugees that's
[45:14.960 --> 45:19.240]  okay they don't have to do anything
[45:23.400 --> 45:27.960]  so that's all gonna be coming up as well we've got MS-13 running around
[45:27.960 --> 45:32.120]  crazy massive illegal waves coming in there economy news and more I've got
[45:32.120 --> 45:35.680]  Donald Trump back peddling saying oh no we shouldn't take all of these quote

[52:50.280 --> 52:53.880]  my phone was dead because I hadn't been charging it or I would have videotaped
[52:53.880 --> 52:58.880]  this I was about to go meet Buckley we will also shoot a Facebook mentions
[52:58.880 --> 53:04.080]  right before I go hiking or jogging putting what I do and I said to her I
[53:04.080 --> 53:10.320]  said hey have you gone under Obama care yet and she just wouldn't even talk to
[53:10.320 --> 53:15.560]  me I said well you got a bumper sticker I'm asking a question and I said let me
[53:15.560 --> 53:22.080]  guess you're a state employer a federal employee and it's all handled by that you
[53:22.080 --> 53:29.760]  don't even know do you and I looked into the window of her car I went oh yeah look
[53:29.760 --> 53:34.880]  right there you got a state employee state of Texas deal hanging around your
[53:34.880 --> 53:40.000]  mirror she's like whatever whatever just got in her car I mean she doesn't even
[53:40.000 --> 53:44.160]  know what she signed on to she doesn't even live in the real world written by
[53:44.160 --> 53:49.560]  foreign insurance companies whose profits are all out the roof right now
[53:49.560 --> 53:55.960]  fraudulently massively increasing premiums my insurance has more than
[53:55.960 --> 54:01.080]  doubled my parents who haven't had a claim in decades who have full coverage
[54:01.080 --> 54:06.520]  for catastrophic events who pay their regular doctor bills saw it double the
[54:06.520 --> 54:12.520]  first year and then now it's almost doubled again and then I tried to go
[54:12.520 --> 54:17.080]  renegotiating it new insurance and they go sorry you have to wait till September
[54:17.080 --> 54:20.720]  so it's now September that's when open enrollment happens so I can try to go

[01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:16.320]  cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio
[01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:23.760]  network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones I was thinking during that
[01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:28.600]  72nd break as we ended the last hour why I'm so crazed I'm sitting on a dock
[01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:34.040]  bass fishing I'm like a sweet old man I'm out barbecuing with the family I'm a
[01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:38.880]  cupcake but when I read about how they put fluoride in the water to brain
[01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:44.560]  damages and create cancer and lower fertility in their own documents when I
[01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:47.480]  sit here and realize they're funding ISIS and al Qaeda to run around murdering
[01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:51.800]  Christians everywhere and make them pay Islam taxes there's not one word out of
[01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:54.920]  the stinking controlled left media that dreams of having their daughters
[01:00:54.920 --> 01:01:00.240]  sexually mutilated by jihadis literally they have a fetish for it it's
[01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:05.800]  cuckolding they don't like the real liberal culture of the West that gave
[01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:09.280]  them the right to run around and do all this stuff they just want to destroy it
[01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:15.440]  like Mount it's head on the wall even though it's their head it's it's a
[01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:25.760]  payback what's the Egyptian legend of the one demigod that goes after his father
[01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:29.040]  because he thinks he's doing evil until he finally gets in the position of power
[01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:33.800]  and then realizes that the unjustifies the means it's all just fraudulent
[01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:40.840]  thought processes but I take ownership and empathize with all the innocence
[01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:44.280]  being murdered by the globalist and all the crises they're creating and I want
[01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:48.040]  to do something about it not just look at the end result that they'll show us
[01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:52.360]  and then say give us more power I look at how they engineered it and then a
[01:01:52.360 --> 01:02:00.200]  fundamental cellular level I get upset about and I know you resonate as well
[01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:07.400]  this is setting brushfires in the minds of men to quote Thomas Jefferson Finland
[01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:09.960]  to raise taxes on the wealthy even though they already have like an 80 plus
[01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:14.040]  percent tax to cover refugee costs please print that little jewel for me
[01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:19.520]  that's a little bit less intrusive than Sweden saying they're gonna make people
[01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:26.120]  house the jihadis in your house and they're telling Germans German women
[01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:41.360]  don't wear short skirts anymore oh man I tell you you talk about a death wish but
[01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:45.560]  see the criminals that run Europe that have hijacked it can get away with this
[01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:52.040]  thinking it was anything so it's not just a fetish to smear garbage all over
[01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:57.880]  Europe I got stacks of articles of women being pulled out of cars rape children
[01:02:57.880 --> 01:03:02.320]  being raped they're like well that's part of the radical Islamic culture to rape
[01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:08.840]  your daughter you see they're kicking out of their countries their poorest their
[01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:14.160]  most criminal their most degenerate their most mentally ill and a bunch of 18
[01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:18.480]  year old 20 year old troublemaker crooks and ISIS people that folks don't want

[01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:45.760]  the next best things to be you know slapped around and put in a slave pit by
[01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:48.880]  a radical jihadi when they got all these women teenagers all over the world
[01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:53.520]  getting on airplanes and flooding to go be in dirt shacks and rape by over a
[01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:57.040]  hundred men then of course they're begging for mommy and daddy after but
[01:03:57.040 --> 01:04:00.480]  that doesn't happen you just get taken out the field shot in the back of the

[01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:28.000]  crimes openly and move the overton window of learned helplessness and mass
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:36.120]  Stockholm syndrome to a new normalcy bias that accepts anything these evil
[01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:41.160]  sick freaks want to carry out and you notice I've turned my rhetoric way up

[01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:07.640]  party run according to a close associate the GOP candidate intends to sign the
[01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:11.640]  loyalty pledge that would bind him to endorse the Republican nominee and would
[01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:15.560]  preclude him a third party run the Republican National Committee has made
[01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:19.760]  it clear that they want every candidate running for nomination to sign a pledge
[01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:24.480]  not to break off and run as a third party candidate under any circumstances
[01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:28.760]  the GOP is worried that third party campaigns will jeopardize the party's
[01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:33.080]  chances against the eventual Democratic presidential candidate and as he's
[01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:37.240]  currently the most popular candidate the GOP is concerned that Donald Trump may
[01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:40.920]  break off from the pact and he has repeatedly threatened to do so

[01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:03.960]  children's torture them and attest mind control but imagine a baby growing up in
[01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:08.360]  an artificial house that was teeny screens on the walls that was an
[01:09:08.360 --> 01:09:13.360]  artificial reality with basically a robot that instructed the child and fed
[01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:20.480]  it that person wouldn't know what planet they were on after 18 years inside that
[01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:26.320]  box you could make them believe that they were a squid creature from Pluto and
[01:09:26.320 --> 01:09:33.240]  basically by increment by successive approximation by gradualism we're being
[01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:48.960]  inserted into a giant panopticonic system that I call a proto matrix and I
[01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:54.040]  talked about a very confederation of science report document that was
[01:09:54.040 --> 01:10:02.520]  declassified in 2000 reclassified in 2001 I put excerpts of it in my book the
[01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:08.280]  road to tyranny the film was road to tyranny the book is the scent of the
[01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:10.440]  tyranny
[01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:18.440]  where they talked about
[01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:25.520]  ending human consciousness basically as we know it and having us hook up to
[01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:29.760]  machines and living inside
[01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:37.760]  stasis pods similar to what you'd use in space travel for suspended animation to
[01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:46.000]  end all war and to have the biosphere funded off of our own heat and that we
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:54.720]  would be fed intervenously by factories basically run by robots and you go
[01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:58.600]  wait I've seen that before it's called the matrix that came out like in 1998
[01:10:58.600 --> 01:11:06.320]  1999 now I'm not saying they'll ever get us to that point and that was just
[01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:13.240]  DARPA back in the 70s theorizing about a perfect world these are mad scientists
[01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:19.000]  and again they've crossed humans with animals and animals with insects they
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:23.320]  have thousands of crops that are pharmacological where corn can produce
[01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:29.120]  any chemical or biological agent they want I mean we're in
[01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:39.760]  Prometheus we have the fire of the gods but the future is not evenly distributed
[01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:45.080]  and so while we're thinking the number one issue is Caitlyn Jenner I mean could
[01:11:45.080 --> 01:11:49.040]  it at least be a good-looking tranny I mean you know it just I mean it is the
[01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:56.560]  most ridiculous garbage you could ever imagine but if they can make us make that
[01:11:56.560 --> 01:12:01.600]  the national consciousness we're not gonna notice that half our neighbors have
[01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:07.560]  got cancer we're not gonna notice that Planned Parenthood is selling baby body
[01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:11.600]  parts and in groups connected with it have been caught keeping babies alive
[01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:17.840]  and then harvesting and then the consciousness so seared and people are
[01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:23.840]  so selfish they're like I don't care as if you get ahead by not caring the good
[01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:30.080]  news is even if these hearings coming up in Congress doesn't defund it the
[01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:34.040]  states are defunding Planned Parenthood it's being exposed for what it is the
[01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:38.440]  whole Margaret Sanger narrative is coming out a lot of the left is waking
[01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:43.240]  up and really looking at their roots and understanding what's really happened
[01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:49.800]  and there'll be more infiltrations if not by this group others and as the type
[01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:54.880]  of investigative hardcore journalism takes root that we've engaged in the
[01:12:54.880 --> 01:13:00.200]  Veritas project is engaged in others have engaged in it will be the beginning
[01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:05.840]  of the end of these people and the polls show it Roe v. Wade blabba tissue 65 to
[01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:13.800]  70% were for abortion in 1974 the year after Roe v. Wade
[01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:24.280]  now it's upwards of 70% are against abortion the numbers have flipped again
[01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:30.920]  we're gaining ground but you have to see the horror of the little baby fighting
[01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:35.920]  for its life about to be chopped up about to be dissected is it okay because
[01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:39.000]  it's Planned Parenthood what if it was Jeffrey Dahmer doing it then it would
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:44.160]  it be bad what if it was a big green spider sucking a baby dry then it'd be
[01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:52.280]  horrific wouldn't it it'd be a horror movie but because it's our own people
[01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:58.520]  doing it oh it's okay see because they've made it all about women's rights just
[01:13:58.520 --> 01:14:01.840]  like it broke a year and a half ago that the vets are on a don't treat list and
[01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:10.720]  are having care rationed by a IBM computer called Thomas Thomas Watson the
[01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:15.600]  guy that ran the third Reich's extermination program from New York City
[01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:22.680]  who received the highest award in Germany that no one else but him got because
[01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:27.200]  Hitler was a project of the elites in this country and they set Hitler up
[01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:35.840]  Hitler was not good by the way but it's beyond what they tell you Roosevelt
[01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:42.720]  wouldn't take the Jews because the liberal Jewish groups in New York City
[01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:48.760]  said they hadn't paid a ransom to them to get out and I've had Dr. Pachinicon who
[01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:53.280]  was a Jew who lost family in Europe when they fled to Cuba they fled to Cuba on a
[01:14:53.280 --> 01:15:00.880]  boat right after he was born because New York City wouldn't take him because the
[01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:06.360]  Jews said you didn't pay up oh was it anti-Semitic I don't want to kill Jews I
[01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:10.600]  guess it is isn't it if I was a real Nazi collaborator then it would be okay
[01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:13.880]  if I was George Soros or Arnold Schwarzenegger that wears Nazi uniforms
[01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:19.440]  and says he wants to be Hitler that's okay but if I point out that the evil
[01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:26.240]  corrupt people like George Soros who was involved then the people above him robbed
[01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:31.200]  the Jews and sucked off the Jews and told them you either pay a ransom or you
[01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:35.200]  go to Israel and then when they said okay we'll go to Israel they said still
[01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:40.320]  you're gonna pay a ransom the average ransom calculates out to one million
[01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:46.480]  dollars today and all the poor Jews or the middle-class Jews that didn't have
[01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:51.200]  it they got sent to be murdered and then the very Jews that helped murder them
[01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:55.800]  sit around and create a Holocaust narrative and projected on as guilt
[01:15:55.800 --> 01:16:01.080]  onto the American people as the national narrative as if we were involved in it as
[01:16:01.080 --> 01:16:05.520]  if the average American that fought Hitler or whose grandfather's fought
[01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:10.960]  Hitler was bad so we have to let that same Jewish mafia that helped kill the
[01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:15.880]  Jews with Hitler engage in all these criminal activities or we're anti-semitic
[01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:21.920]  I say feel your hand Nazi loving scum and go straight to hell where you came
[01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:28.240]  from your opportunistic criminals you're not Jews you're an organized crime
[01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:34.760]  syndicate ADL Southern Parvy Law Center all of you groups no more holding back
[01:16:34.760 --> 01:16:42.520]  folks no more holding back my family fought the Nazis you helped them you
[01:16:42.520 --> 01:16:53.440]  won't go after real Nazis you protect them your scum your filth your criminals
[01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:58.400]  now let's go to the good news here Congress starts playing parenthood
[01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:03.720]  hearings here it is recently the nation's attention has been drawn to a
[01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:08.600]  series of undercover videos recorded by members of a group called the Center
[01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:13.880]  for Medical Progress these videos contain discussions with representatives of
[01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:18.440]  the abortion providing organization Planned Parenthood regarding the exchange
[01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:24.000]  of money for the body parts of unborn children to be used in research I'm here
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:27.720]  today to share my story to not only highlight the whore of abortion taking
[01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:31.920]  place at Planned Parenthood but to give a voice to other survivors like me and
[01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:37.080]  most importantly to give a name a face and a voice to the hundreds of thousands
[01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:40.880]  of children who will have their lives ended by Planned Parenthood this year
[01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:46.160]  alone Planned Parenthood has been a specific target of many of these types
[01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:51.600]  of attacks and just since the year 2000 they've been the target of nine similar
[01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:56.480]  smear campaigns using hidden videos or other recordings full of innuendo and
[01:17:56.480 --> 01:18:01.360]  false claims every single time these allegations have been thoroughly
[01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:06.840]  investigated and debunked I loved Ricky Nelson and Ozzie but their history it's
[01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:11.960]  gone it's a new America and this hearing is about eliminating an overruling
[01:18:11.960 --> 01:18:17.680]  Roe v. Wade I say fun Planned Parenthood it doesn't deliver abortions with
[01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:23.200]  federal funds this hearing is about abortion and I support Roe v. Wade
[01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:27.680]  another lie from mr. Cohen
[01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:32.760]  Planned Parenthood's on record getting federal funds for abortion Travis County
[01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:36.760]  where this broadcast comes to you from is the only county in Texas that takes
[01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:43.240]  taxpayer money and pays for women's abortions that upset me so much I moved
[01:18:43.240 --> 01:18:46.360]  to Hays County when they did it
[01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:54.800]  but that's how evil these people are they will sit there and lie straight to
[01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:59.240]  your face and all they are whether they be black white German Jewish Chinese
[01:18:59.240 --> 01:19:04.160]  Mexican is an evil group of people working together through fraud against
[01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:09.680]  the rest of us and it's time to expose what's happening and not be cowardly and
[01:19:09.680 --> 01:19:15.040]  and and really be retrospective and ask which side we want to be on now coming
[01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:18.440]  up after the break abortion survivor gives powerful testimony before
[01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:25.400]  Congress Gina Jessen we're gonna play part of that when we return straight
[01:19:25.400 --> 01:19:30.200]  ahead but if I'm being particularly nasty today it's because what the New
[01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:38.680]  World Order is doing is nasty and we don't have any hope of countering what's
[01:19:38.680 --> 01:19:46.640]  happening with the globalist if we don't expose exactly what's going on and
[01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:53.240]  exactly what's happening now when is the ADL gonna attack George Soros and
[01:19:53.240 --> 01:20:00.240]  Arnold Schwarzenegger because those people are real evil turn on the news and

[01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:55.520]  minute fifty five minute testimony to Congress we're gonna play some of this
[01:24:55.520 --> 01:25:00.440]  right now the rest of it later the video is on info wars dot com here it is
[01:25:00.440 --> 01:25:05.840]  good morning my name is Gianna Jessen and I would like to thank you so much for
[01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:11.920]  the opportunity to testify here today my biological mother was seven and a half
[01:25:11.920 --> 01:25:17.320]  months pregnant when she went to a plan parenthood and was advised and they
[01:25:17.320 --> 01:25:23.840]  advised her to have a late term saline abortion this method of abortion burns
[01:25:23.840 --> 01:25:28.920]  the baby inside and out blinding and suffocating the child who is then born
[01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:36.520]  dead usually within 24 hours and there should be a photo there yes this is what
[01:25:36.520 --> 01:25:45.520]  I survived instead of dying after 18 hours of being burned in my mother's
[01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:50.560]  womb I was delivered alive in an abortion clinic in Los Angeles on April
[01:25:50.560 --> 01:26:00.480]  the 6th 1977 you can see a photo as well of my medical records my medical
[01:26:00.480 --> 01:26:07.880]  records state born alive during saline abortion 6 a.m. yeah now they just kill
[01:26:07.880 --> 01:26:13.240]  you if you don't see legal thankfully the abortionist was not at work yet had he
[01:26:13.240 --> 01:26:17.240]  been there he would have ended my life with strangulation suffocation or
[01:26:17.240 --> 01:26:23.560]  leaving me there to die instead a nurse called an ambulance what an extremist
[01:26:23.560 --> 01:26:29.280]  and I was rushed to a hospital doctors did not expect me to live I did good
[01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:35.280]  pause now and back it up 10 seconds now if you're a preemie they give you the
[01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:39.480]  full vaccine battery and the nurses say it's killing the babies and they go
[01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:44.200]  hospital orders prime directive Thomas Watson computer that's in the news that's
[01:26:44.200 --> 01:26:48.000]  who now a most big bioethics boards are no longer men and women they don't want
[01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:51.760]  to actually do the killing so the machine says administer shots they get
[01:26:51.760 --> 01:26:56.440]  there and then the women battle mainly women nurses with the respirators with
[01:26:56.440 --> 01:26:59.320]  the defibrillators and they give the injections maybe start dying they went
[01:26:59.320 --> 01:27:02.480]  to full battle mode to keep them alive but they follow their orders yes sir
[01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:05.320]  prepare injections murder murder murder murder murder murder murder murder murder
[01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:09.640]  murder and then they put the respirators on them it's just such a sick joke
[01:27:09.640 --> 01:27:14.880]  they're murdering everyone they love it the public loves it oh take all your
[01:27:14.880 --> 01:27:18.520]  shots all you that serve the system just keep believing in it they're gonna saw
[01:27:18.520 --> 01:27:22.120]  your legs off of diabetes they're gonna kill you with fluoride they're gonna
[01:27:22.120 --> 01:27:26.400]  murder you people say man why are you so hardcore because it's true because I
[01:27:26.400 --> 01:27:32.680]  see it I accept the evil and then resist it I accept it's happening I don't
[01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:38.240]  accept it itself I say no but I accept reality
[01:27:41.240 --> 01:27:45.480]  by the way it's illegal to kill a baby once they're born but they still do it
[01:27:45.480 --> 01:27:51.360]  let's continue with their testimony my life with strangulation suffocation or
[01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:58.320]  leaving me there to die liberally instead a nurse called an ambulance and I
[01:27:58.320 --> 01:28:02.840]  was rushed to a hospital doctors did not expect me to live now she be killed
[01:28:02.840 --> 01:28:07.880]  by machine I was later diagnosed with cerebral palsy which was caused by a
[01:28:07.880 --> 01:28:13.960]  lack of oxygen to my brain while I was never supposed to hold up my head or
[01:28:13.960 --> 01:28:20.600]  walk I do how dare you cerebral palsy ladies and gentlemen is a tremendous
[01:28:20.600 --> 01:28:28.340]  gift to me I was eventually placed in foster care and later adopted and hear
[01:28:28.340 --> 01:28:38.280]  me clearly I forgive my biological mother my birth I was used as an expert
[01:28:38.280 --> 01:28:42.520]  witness in a case where an abortionist had been caught strangling a child to
[01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:48.840]  death after being born alive and caught laughing them Margaret Sanger oh the
[01:28:48.840 --> 01:28:54.040]  founder of Planned Parenthood said the following the most merciful thing that a
[01:28:54.040 --> 01:29:02.000]  large family does to one of its infant members is to kill it oh you will die
[01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:07.160]  Planned Parenthood is not ashamed of what they have done or continue to do but
[01:29:07.160 --> 01:29:13.000]  we will have to give an account as a nation before God for our apathy and
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:18.520]  for the murder of over 50 million children in the womb the sacrifice you
[01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:23.960]  mean every time we falter encourage as individuals and fail to confront this
[01:29:23.960 --> 01:29:29.560]  evil I wonder how many lives have been lost in our silence we'll be back while
[01:29:29.560 --> 01:29:34.280]  we make sure we're gonna play more of this later when we come back we have a

[01:30:07.800 --> 01:30:12.040]  understanding those rights and fighting for them our country is falling apart
[01:30:12.040 --> 01:30:16.320]  because people have forgotten to fight to stand up in the face of tyranny and do

[01:34:37.880 --> 01:34:44.000]  house 3 million people already set up sitting empty yet has taken zero
[01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:49.960]  refugees while they lobby through Al Jazeera TV I saw this last night
[01:34:49.960 --> 01:34:55.840]  monitoring and that the West should do more for the millions 800,000 this year
[01:34:55.840 --> 01:35:03.360]  that have shown up in Germany 800,000 in a country of 75 million that's already
[01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:11.360]  like a third you know third world or more just showing up and carjacking and
[01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:17.680]  robbing and raping and filled with weird socialist wealth redistribution
[01:35:17.680 --> 01:35:22.440]  ideology that fits in perfectly with the socialist and communist parties to
[01:35:22.440 --> 01:35:31.920]  totally take over and that ties in with Finland to raise taxes on the wealthy to
[01:35:31.920 --> 01:35:40.120]  cover refugee cost that's yahoo news Reuters oh my goodness and there's
[01:35:40.120 --> 01:35:44.240]  other corporate welfare universities make finance students nationwide by
[01:35:44.240 --> 01:35:49.640]  Jonathan Rubers textbook that's the guy that said the public's dumb thank God
[01:35:49.640 --> 01:35:54.160]  yeah Obamacare doubles or triple cost but we had to hide that so I figured out
[01:35:54.160 --> 01:36:02.120]  the plan to lie and Obama adopted it two plus two equals five again it's just
[01:36:02.120 --> 01:36:10.360]  the cold-hearted evil of these people after we cover that the really big news
[01:36:10.360 --> 01:36:17.000]  one year 6,700 airstrikes and four billion after Obama vowed to destroy
[01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:23.400]  ISIS jihad is still on the offensive taking over and that dovetails with 50
[01:36:23.400 --> 01:36:30.280]  spies go public Steve Watson article and say we're basically protecting ISIS and
[01:36:30.280 --> 01:36:36.720]  we're forced to put out fake intelligence reports it is bold man for our
[01:36:36.720 --> 01:36:40.200]  own government to fund ISIS and al-Qaeda and now they admit they're
[01:36:40.200 --> 01:36:44.200]  streaming into Europe with the refugees many of which are victims of their own
[01:36:44.200 --> 01:36:48.440]  evil and I feel for some of the refugees but politically they're being used as a
[01:36:48.440 --> 01:37:04.760]  weapon the globalists are doing this on purpose we're gonna go to our guest Steve
[01:37:04.760 --> 01:37:10.200]  Wetzel here in just a moment who I asked to come on the show I've been in
[01:37:10.200 --> 01:37:14.120]  talks with these folks we're spent about 10 minutes on this thing get back into
[01:37:14.120 --> 01:37:21.440]  the news I've been in talks well they've been a sponsor for four years three four
[01:37:21.440 --> 01:37:28.760]  years but I've been in talks for two years to do this and finally we got it
[01:37:28.760 --> 01:37:32.240]  all done I'll be honest with you I went out and talked to some of the other top
[01:37:32.240 --> 01:37:37.880]  providers and they just couldn't provide something as good as is low a cost that
[01:37:37.880 --> 01:37:41.960]  was as high quality because I believe in treating people like I want to be
[01:37:41.960 --> 01:37:49.120]  treated the golden rule do unto others as you'd have them do unto you and plus
[01:37:49.120 --> 01:37:54.080]  free market if I sold cars I want to be a really good brand of car that didn't
[01:37:54.080 --> 01:37:57.280]  have a lot of problems so you were happy and came back and four years bottom of
[01:37:57.280 --> 01:38:03.280]  the car from me and finally when the storeable foods market exploded again a
[01:38:03.280 --> 01:38:06.280]  few months ago with the meltdown accelerating with China with the
[01:38:06.280 --> 01:38:12.320]  situation Europe with the refugee crisis with governments hoarding food I called
[01:38:12.320 --> 01:38:20.320]  up my Patriot supply and I said you know we talked for the last two years of
[01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:24.840]  UBM sponsors for three about putting out info war select which is your full
[01:38:24.840 --> 01:38:30.880]  spectrum of foods but packaged with our labeling and then giving us the lowest
[01:38:30.880 --> 01:38:35.040]  price you offer anybody and by the way they gave us a price so low if we chose
[01:38:35.040 --> 01:38:38.160]  because we don't make a huge profit on it but I think we'll just sell more
[01:38:38.160 --> 01:38:41.480]  making bigger profit and funder operation that's how capitalism works that
[01:38:41.480 --> 01:38:46.680]  it's even lower than their prices at my Patriot supply who are sponsors we sell
[01:38:46.680 --> 01:38:52.240]  their full spectrum you can see it at infowarstore.com we left the my Patriot
[01:38:52.240 --> 01:38:55.560]  stuff up there because it's excellent it's only a little bit more than info war
[01:38:55.560 --> 01:39:00.480]  select that is in the same patented tote I mean you know at Walmart or Target
[01:39:00.480 --> 01:39:04.720]  just the containers almost cost as much as this stuff does with the food but they
[01:39:04.720 --> 01:39:08.920]  buy them in mass so they're very inexpensive and I want to go over in
[01:39:08.920 --> 01:39:15.440]  this segment why it's so good and why people should get prepared but basically
[01:39:15.440 --> 01:39:24.360]  it's dropship right from their factory it is the same size meals just a little
[01:39:24.360 --> 01:39:31.840]  bit less in cost no one can match this no one can come close to this believe me
[01:39:31.840 --> 01:39:35.480]  I was in talks with three different major food manufacturers that have good
[01:39:35.480 --> 01:39:41.480]  names and they would not go to the level that my Patriot supply has and I'll be
[01:39:41.480 --> 01:39:44.160]  honest with you they're great folks I twisted their arm for two years to do
[01:39:44.160 --> 01:39:49.800]  this so I drive a hard bargain they're great folks and I'm passing the savings
[01:39:49.800 --> 01:39:52.560]  on to you they already have some of the best prices out there the highest
[01:39:52.560 --> 01:39:57.800]  quality food it's why I chose them we can sell 50 different companies water
[01:39:57.800 --> 01:40:01.520]  filters make more money dominate the market I only sell four different
[01:40:01.520 --> 01:40:05.720]  brands because they're the best and they're affordable at info or store.com
[01:40:05.720 --> 01:40:09.600]  well we have been able to find like something like 10 different really good
[01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:14.320]  non-gmo non-hybrid heirloom seed companies so we have the info or seed

[01:41:17.400 --> 01:41:21.360]  to Steve or my crew was and I should send over talking points of why you
[01:41:21.360 --> 01:41:23.880]  think people should have storeable foods and it's exactly what I think I
[01:41:23.880 --> 01:41:29.200]  personally just use the storeable foods after a few years even though it lasts
[01:41:29.200 --> 01:41:33.000]  10 or more years or I give it to charity and they people really like it
[01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.680]  because I always have enough for myself my family and my neighbors so I'm
[01:41:35.680 --> 01:41:39.960]  about to make more purchases myself and rotate out the three-year-old food I've
[01:41:39.960 --> 01:41:43.920]  got I rotate food out every three years it's just an insurance policy I can eat
[01:41:43.920 --> 01:41:48.000]  it's also great when you go camping this is the highest quality Steve you've got
[01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:51.920]  these points here the need for preparedness the upcoming storm it's
[01:41:51.920 --> 01:41:57.960]  already here whether it's economic political or natural driven yes let's
[01:41:57.960 --> 01:42:02.280]  go over it all here with what's happening Texas once it's gold back all
[01:42:02.280 --> 01:42:06.040]  the things that are happening you heard but first off thank you for giving us
[01:42:06.040 --> 01:42:10.720]  such a great offer and and partnering with info wars to bring folks info or
[01:42:10.720 --> 01:42:17.560]  select am I hyping it that this is the lowest ever that you've gone this is
[01:42:17.560 --> 01:42:24.520]  yes the lowest we've ever gone and basically we really wanted to make a a
[01:42:24.520 --> 01:42:30.400]  good impression to you know your customers and give everybody a chance to
[01:42:30.400 --> 01:42:36.480]  really try our products well they're amazing and I mean I was just honest I
[01:42:36.480 --> 01:42:39.320]  went around because I would like to have four or five sponsors and you guys
[01:42:39.320 --> 01:42:43.200]  just have the best food at the lowest price so that's why we have one company
[01:42:43.200 --> 01:42:48.040]  that's my patriot supply how do you guys have such quality and still have the
[01:42:48.040 --> 01:42:53.520]  lowest prices I guess you just have smaller profit margins we do it's for
[01:42:53.520 --> 01:42:59.200]  us we actually live eat and breathe preparedness so really this is just a
[01:42:59.200 --> 01:43:03.480]  bunch of people who are really into preparedness who are trying to share
[01:43:03.480 --> 01:43:10.640]  this preparedness movement with people as far as food it all begins with our
[01:43:10.640 --> 01:43:16.280]  ingredients we just don't settle for any ingredients we actually go out and we
[01:43:16.280 --> 01:43:23.280]  analyze these things we truly want to have 25 year shelf life food and you
[01:43:23.280 --> 01:43:26.800]  know some people may cut corners you're not going to get that with my
[01:43:26.800 --> 01:43:31.720]  patriot supply we really want this to be available to people when they need it
[01:43:31.720 --> 01:43:37.440]  when when that time strikes they need to know that they can rely upon our food
[01:43:37.440 --> 01:43:41.640]  and our products well the packaging alone is the best in the industry and
[01:43:41.640 --> 01:43:45.640]  that's why you've gone from being small in five years to dominating let's let's
[01:43:45.640 --> 01:43:50.080]  go through the quality of the food and what folks will find an info or select
[01:43:50.080 --> 01:43:55.680]  calm that URL will take you directly to the info or store subpage and pages that
[01:43:55.680 --> 01:44:00.240]  that have the full spectrum that you know the full layout of the same foods you
[01:44:00.240 --> 01:44:04.240]  can get at my patriot supply that are excellent as well just hit a little bit
[01:44:04.240 --> 01:44:08.080]  lower price and support the info war as well talk about some of the quality of
[01:44:08.080 --> 01:44:11.680]  the food and let's get into why you think people should be getting prepared now
[01:44:11.680 --> 01:44:15.080]  I mean I know when I called you guys a few months ago I said let me guess your
[01:44:15.080 --> 01:44:19.360]  sponsors I bet you guys are having trouble at your factories keeping supply
[01:44:19.360 --> 01:44:22.560]  the oh yeah it's exploded I mean people can see what we're warning about
[01:44:22.560 --> 01:44:26.640]  starting to come true I hope people don't need this food but this is a no
[01:44:26.640 --> 01:44:31.280]  brainer to not be dependent on the system people must have horrible food mm-hmm
[01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:35.760]  well like I said it begins with our ingredients so one thing for sure we've
[01:44:35.760 --> 01:44:43.880]  we have no MSG we have no autolyzed yeast extract we want our food to taste just
[01:44:43.880 --> 01:44:50.800]  as good in 25 years as it will now so we have the best packaging in the industry
[01:44:50.800 --> 01:44:56.240]  not all my lars created equal so we provide a true military grade barrier
[01:44:56.240 --> 01:45:01.680]  against light oxygen moisture and you could see the toast at this food's
[01:45:01.680 --> 01:45:07.200]  packaging it's made to be either stored underneath a bed or stacked in a closet
[01:45:07.200 --> 01:45:12.600]  you can throw it in the back of your vehicle it's it's made for somebody to
[01:45:12.600 --> 01:45:18.400]  carry along with them now you're saying you know why do people need to prepare
[01:45:18.400 --> 01:45:24.520]  now well one of the things I can tell you is I know people are preparing now I
[01:45:24.520 --> 01:45:30.120]  mean our food is going out as soon as it is produced on our production line
[01:45:30.120 --> 01:45:37.760]  literally it is going out that fast I think the global climate now with what
[01:45:37.760 --> 01:45:42.800]  they're seeing politically economically people feel this need to be prepared
[01:45:42.800 --> 01:45:46.760]  whether or not they want to call themselves preppers or whether they
[01:45:46.760 --> 01:45:50.400]  feel that they're in a preparedness movement a lot of people are waking up
[01:45:50.400 --> 01:45:56.360]  to the fact that something is happening and I could just tell you from our sales
[01:45:56.360 --> 01:46:02.720]  we cannot keep enough food stored I mean we're literally producing it and
[01:46:02.720 --> 01:46:07.960]  getting it out to people and there is so much of an awakening going on right now
[01:46:07.960 --> 01:46:13.320]  that other food manufacturers other people that are in food storage have
[01:46:13.320 --> 01:46:18.920]  contacted my Patriots apply to ask if we could help package some of this for
[01:46:18.920 --> 01:46:23.960]  them to get it out to the people but right now I assure you our priority is
[01:46:23.960 --> 01:46:31.520]  for your show Alex your website info wars select comm and for our own
[01:46:31.520 --> 01:46:37.400]  customers with my Patriots supply comm absolutely and when you back off at
[01:46:37.400 --> 01:46:41.040]  this and look at it from the big picture there's a lot of aggressive advertising
[01:46:41.040 --> 01:46:44.160]  out there people claiming this people claiming that but we've done the deep
[01:46:44.160 --> 01:46:48.440]  research on this you guys really are the best deal out there the quickest
[01:46:48.440 --> 01:46:53.640]  delivery manufacturing your own food keeping with standards the highest is
[01:46:53.640 --> 01:46:58.160]  what I choose for my family and your Patriots you're not fly by night groups
[01:46:58.160 --> 01:47:03.360]  you're not Johnny come lately you're here for the long haul and I just I'm not
[01:47:03.360 --> 01:47:06.560]  gonna bash some of the other groups or some other great groups out there this
[01:47:06.560 --> 01:47:10.320]  mother really high quality groups they just cost a lot more when you're similar
[01:47:10.320 --> 01:47:14.120]  food for a lot less so you can get stuff as good out there it is gonna cost you
[01:47:14.120 --> 01:47:18.560]  twice as much or three times as much but I've you know tested out the stuff you
[01:47:18.560 --> 01:47:22.680]  get at the urban you know outfitters and you know REI and the rest of it
[01:47:22.680 --> 01:47:26.200]  versus what you've got and it yours is just as good or better for a third or
[01:47:26.200 --> 01:47:29.640]  half the price depending on what the product is but your protein pack
[01:47:29.640 --> 01:47:34.200]  specials all of it is just essential I know you want to get into your
[01:47:34.200 --> 01:47:38.120]  customers but I happen to know the inside baseball industry wide government
[01:47:38.120 --> 01:47:44.100]  police departments corporations rich people are hoarding food now I hope we
[01:47:44.100 --> 01:47:48.120]  don't go into a major depression but I think the smartest move people that can
[01:47:48.120 --> 01:47:51.920]  afford it is to have a two-year food supply but if you don't have a three
[01:47:51.920 --> 01:47:56.040]  month food supply for your whole family folks I believe you are being recklessly
[01:47:56.040 --> 01:48:01.680]  negligent it's so affordable at info or select comm and a little bit of profit
[01:48:01.680 --> 01:48:06.160]  we make helps fund this operation we're about to launch the TV network so much
[01:48:06.160 --> 01:48:09.400]  more I only have a sponsor on the show maybe once a month to help promote
[01:48:09.400 --> 01:48:13.720]  things we don't have an infomercial format but this is also a public service
[01:48:13.720 --> 01:48:18.800]  announcement if you don't have your preparedness straight you're crazy I mean
[01:48:18.800 --> 01:48:21.920]  look at the stock market look at Texas wanting its gold back talk about that
[01:48:21.920 --> 01:48:31.120]  Steve well this is just an example of how people in general are really not
[01:48:31.120 --> 01:48:35.680]  trusting what's going on with the federal government I'm not saying that
[01:48:35.680 --> 01:48:41.160]  everybody is bad and everything is wrong but but people are starting to wake up
[01:48:41.160 --> 01:48:47.000]  and realize that they have to start taking responsibility for themselves so
[01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:51.920]  if we look at like a state like Texas I admire what they're doing it's a group
[01:48:51.920 --> 01:48:58.280]  of people in that state that are thinking hey you know we need to join
[01:48:58.280 --> 01:49:03.280]  together and and be prepared for what's going on they can see what direction the
[01:49:03.280 --> 01:49:10.320]  federal government is going and I think a lot of people would agree that the
[01:49:10.320 --> 01:49:17.760]  state elected to to have a federal government it wasn't the federal
[01:49:17.760 --> 01:49:23.640]  government electing to have states so you know where does all of this lead us
[01:49:23.640 --> 01:49:29.840]  it leads us to the fact that the individual person needs to be prepared
[01:49:29.840 --> 01:49:34.800]  needs to take responsibility and take care of him or herself to be empowered
[01:49:34.800 --> 01:49:42.280]  you know having this food is just one part of that you know the naysayers
[01:49:42.280 --> 01:49:46.880]  will say something like the state of Texas will want to the seed from the
[01:49:46.880 --> 01:49:50.680]  nation it's not about that you know people should it's about we can't trust
[01:49:50.680 --> 01:49:54.120]  the private federal reserve to hold the gold it turns out most of it's covered
[01:49:54.120 --> 01:49:57.960]  with tungsten I heard that 15 years ago as a rumor was confirmed last year I
[01:49:57.960 --> 01:50:02.240]  mean the whole thing is a paper tiger it's coming down if not this year next
[01:50:02.240 --> 01:50:05.640]  year the next I don't know it's just the whole thing is like building a house on
[01:50:05.640 --> 01:50:09.920]  top an active volcano it's insane Steve I want to start checking in with you once

[01:54:18.800 --> 01:54:23.000]  info wars.com news centers in Austin Texas where we're trying to break through
[01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:30.040]  people's trance through their brainwashing and if people don't get
[01:54:30.040 --> 01:54:35.600]  prepared mentally physically economically it's just crazy it doesn't
[01:54:35.600 --> 01:54:38.800]  mean having storeable foods or a garden is going to save the world but that
[01:54:38.800 --> 01:54:43.680]  attitude is now I want to open the phones up in the next hour and cover a
[01:54:43.680 --> 01:54:47.360]  ton of news the toll-free number to join us on any of the issues any of the
[01:54:47.360 --> 01:54:52.320]  items I've raised you're welcome to call in I'd love to hear from you agree
[01:54:52.320 --> 01:55:06.600]  disagree whatever the case may be 800-259-9231 800-259-9231 how arrogant
[01:55:06.600 --> 01:55:10.800]  is it though a political correctness and how buffaloed is the West to say you're
[01:55:10.800 --> 01:55:13.520]  gonna accept millions of people under your country and you got to pay for them
[01:55:13.520 --> 01:55:18.720]  but Saudi Arabia won't take one refugee and neither will any of the other Arab
[01:55:18.720 --> 01:55:26.320]  states it's it's just a joke I'm gonna break that down at the start of the
[01:55:26.320 --> 01:55:34.040]  next hour because it's so important on the 15th anniversary of 9-11 can you
[01:55:34.040 --> 01:55:39.880]  believe it's been that long so the 14th of the 15th another one of those mental
[01:55:39.880 --> 01:55:46.720]  staff is it's the 15th anniversary of that attack are we safer now than we
[01:55:46.720 --> 01:55:52.120]  were then no our government is running ISIS al Qaeda and protecting them and
[01:55:52.120 --> 01:55:57.360]  that's in the news and the former head of defense intelligence that cue that
[01:55:57.360 --> 01:56:01.960]  back up for next hour went public and then another top general went public and
[01:56:01.960 --> 01:56:07.240]  said we are protecting them we helped fund them and I followed orders and the
[01:56:07.240 --> 01:56:11.560]  intelligence is being covered up well now
[01:56:11.560 --> 01:56:17.120]  50 spies have gone public and blown the whistle on the eve of 9-11 on the
[01:56:17.120 --> 01:56:30.040]  anniversary and said that they put out the proper intelligence of what ISIS was
[01:56:30.040 --> 01:56:33.720]  doing from the beginning and that it's covered up and that fake intelligence is
[01:56:33.720 --> 01:56:38.240]  created above them which is a fraud which is a criminal act in every sense of
[01:56:38.240 --> 01:56:44.160]  the meaning and then we have a lot of these refugees that are criminals that
[01:56:44.160 --> 01:56:49.000]  are military aged men that turn out to be ISIS coming into the West and the
[01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:53.680]  answer is in Germany don't wear short skirts you've got to comply with the
[01:56:53.680 --> 01:56:57.960]  visitors with the precious migrants that show up and say give us everything free
[01:56:57.960 --> 01:57:02.480]  and then Donald Trump who'd come out we're gonna play this clip and said a
[01:57:02.480 --> 01:57:06.160]  few days ago hey we got to take a Merkel's doing a great job we got to
[01:57:06.160 --> 01:57:10.240]  bring these people into America nobody else will probably politically correct
[01:57:10.240 --> 01:57:16.800]  he's now backpedaled let's play this clip here is with Sean Hannity well it's a
[01:57:16.800 --> 01:57:21.560]  serious problem we haven't seen anything like it since the Second World War and
[01:57:21.560 --> 01:57:25.160]  it's getting worse and worse and I was actually impressed in one way but
[01:57:25.160 --> 01:57:29.520]  surprised that a Merkel in Germany allowed this to happen because they're
[01:57:29.520 --> 01:57:33.920]  really flowing through all over Europe and if you notice Russia is not taking
[01:57:33.920 --> 01:57:38.880]  and China is not taking and the Gulf States whether you look at Saudi Arabia
[01:57:38.880 --> 01:57:44.200]  Qatar or any of them they're taking none but some of them are and some of them
[01:57:44.200 --> 01:57:49.400]  are actually being very generous it just really I wonder you know where all
[01:57:49.400 --> 01:57:53.560]  these people are coming from exactly and what are they representing because do
[01:57:53.560 --> 01:57:57.240]  you have people from ISIS in that group you know there's a lot of security risk
[01:57:57.240 --> 01:58:02.720]  with it but something has to be done it's a an unbelievable humanitarian
[01:58:02.720 --> 01:58:12.320]  problem something must be done something must be done now when we come
[01:58:12.320 --> 01:58:17.000]  back we're gonna launch the phone system and we're going to start taking your
[01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:25.000]  phone calls at 800-259-9231 and I'm gonna get into all the economic news all
[01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:30.840]  the Hillary news her fall is becoming more assured by the moment John Boehner
[01:58:30.840 --> 01:58:36.480]  meeting secretly with the communist leader of the world of the pub and more
[01:58:36.480 --> 01:58:39.680]  that's all the third hour

[02:00:31.040 --> 02:00:35.640]  all right we played the original clip earlier if you just joined us of trumps
[02:00:35.640 --> 02:00:39.920]  saying we got to bring the illegals in it's our job to pay for everybody here's
[02:00:39.920 --> 02:00:45.720]  the new clip with Hannity with him backing off of that and I mean the big
[02:00:45.720 --> 02:00:49.280]  problem is how do you flip-flop from we can't take all these people there's a
[02:00:49.280 --> 02:00:53.320]  lot of criminals from around the world trying to get here which is true to now
[02:00:53.320 --> 02:00:57.040]  we got to take all these people when really it's the jails and the criminals
[02:00:57.040 --> 02:01:00.760]  and the welfare heads that the Middle East is dumping out won't take any of
[02:01:00.760 --> 02:01:05.000]  them back in let's go ahead and go to this clip of Trump back peddling look
[02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:09.800]  from a humanitarian standpoint I'd love to help but we have our own problems we
[02:01:09.800 --> 02:01:13.440]  have so many problems that we have to solve you have over there the Gulf
[02:01:13.440 --> 02:01:18.200]  States tremendously wealthy you have five five groups of people six groups
[02:01:18.200 --> 02:01:23.680]  they're not taking anybody Saudi Arabia Qatar Bahrain these are tremendously
[02:01:23.680 --> 02:01:28.400]  wealthy and powerful from the standpoint of money they're not taking
[02:01:28.400 --> 02:01:32.400]  anybody right Russia is not taking nobody's taking we're supposed to take
[02:01:32.400 --> 02:01:35.520]  we have to straighten out our own problems you have millions of people
[02:01:35.520 --> 02:01:39.520]  potentially and if Obama would have gone across the line that he drew the
[02:01:39.520 --> 02:01:43.400]  artificial line in the sand that he drew you wouldn't have this problem in the
[02:01:43.400 --> 02:01:51.760]  first place so there you go there you go that is that is him now starting to
[02:01:51.760 --> 02:01:57.640]  basically backtrack Obama said the line was chemical weapons that ISIS slash
[02:01:57.640 --> 02:02:02.440]  al-Qaeda used the line was our government and the neocons and John
[02:02:02.440 --> 02:02:12.440]  McCain the Republican leadership that you love so much Donald Trump the line
[02:02:12.440 --> 02:02:16.760]  was putting ISIS in control to begin with and now defending him and
[02:02:16.760 --> 02:02:20.720]  protecting him we're gonna cover that after we take some phone calls this is
[02:02:20.720 --> 02:02:24.680]  short segment let's get one call in now Stephen in Florida you're on the air
[02:02:24.680 --> 02:02:38.400]  welcome yeah yeah I just wanted to say as far as my mind just blanked out okay
[02:02:38.400 --> 02:02:42.320]  now about okay here's the thing with everything that's going on that you
[02:02:42.320 --> 02:02:48.920]  cover so you know accurately I am really frustrated as a Christian I'm a believer
[02:02:48.920 --> 02:02:54.400]  in Jesus Christ I've been saved over 36 years and I am so frustrated because
[02:02:54.400 --> 02:02:58.800]  the people that should be the most awake and the most aware and I have to say
[02:02:58.800 --> 02:03:03.880]  this seem to be the most brainwashed and zombified that's the Christians the
[02:03:03.880 --> 02:03:08.080]  world Council of Churches and National Council of Churches and 501c3 turn them
[02:03:08.080 --> 02:03:12.280]  into government organs where government think tanks and private groups think
[02:03:12.280 --> 02:03:18.440]  tanks write the theology for all the major denominations the Pope basically
[02:03:18.440 --> 02:03:23.200]  is like the world communist leader now and I heard Christians calling in the
[02:03:23.200 --> 02:03:26.400]  local talk show yesterday I was listening to the news and they were like
[02:03:26.400 --> 02:03:32.040]  follow Romans 13 do what they say preachers should marry gay people the
[02:03:32.040 --> 02:03:35.960]  Bible doesn't say anything against it blah blah blah well it does but
[02:03:35.960 --> 02:03:39.520]  regardless they were saying that woman should be in jail doesn't matter
[02:03:39.520 --> 02:03:47.960]  Christians do what they're told that's a giant Romans 13 pacifier when all Paul
[02:03:47.960 --> 02:03:52.240]  did was say no to the government and ended up being killed for it with the
[02:03:52.240 --> 02:03:56.240]  rest of the disciples I mean was there any disciple that didn't get killed for
[02:03:56.240 --> 02:04:01.640]  not following the state's orders this is inverted reality with stupid fake
[02:04:01.640 --> 02:04:08.640]  Christians sitting in there loving all of this okay so you could tell the
[02:04:08.640 --> 02:04:13.320]  average Methodist or even the average Baptist now to come to Sunday school the
[02:04:13.320 --> 02:04:17.400]  government legalized roasting aborted fetuses and they would eat barbecue
[02:04:17.400 --> 02:04:21.320]  baby and I'm not joking they'd say the state ordered me to eat barbecue baby
[02:04:21.320 --> 02:04:26.600]  I'm gonna do it there's a nothing they won't do so you made a great point
[02:04:26.600 --> 02:04:32.080]  that's because these aren't churches these are 501c3 government whorehouses
[02:04:32.080 --> 02:04:37.240]  anything else Stephen yeah I just wanted to say I think the major factor in
[02:04:37.240 --> 02:04:40.640]  why so many Christians are so out of it and don't want to believe what's going
[02:04:40.640 --> 02:04:44.760]  on because they believe in this break free trip rapture theory is I'm gonna
[02:04:44.760 --> 02:04:50.160]  come back to you absolutely yeah a total cop out a reset button like it's the
[02:04:50.160 --> 02:04:54.720]  edge of tomorrow there is no reset I've read the Bible a five-year-old could
[02:04:54.720 --> 02:04:59.720]  understand it you go through the tribulation cowards we're being told
[02:04:59.720 --> 02:05:04.080]  that Snowden's window for a plea bargain deal is closing Bloomberg reports a
[02:05:04.080 --> 02:05:07.400]  national security specialist saying many people in government believe the
[02:05:07.400 --> 02:05:11.160]  journalists who receive Snowden's material are not capable of protecting it
[02:05:11.160 --> 02:05:15.800]  from a competent and committed state-level adversary even if Snowden did
[02:05:15.800 --> 02:05:19.040]  not give the material to others they argue it would have been ripe for the
[02:05:19.040 --> 02:05:22.680]  picking well isn't that true of Hillary's handling of emails didn't her
[02:05:22.680 --> 02:05:27.680]  violation of protocol expose above top secret data to state-level adversaries
[02:05:27.680 --> 02:05:32.920]  Snowden exposed criminal actions of our government done in the name of national
[02:05:32.920 --> 02:05:38.360]  security Hillary compromised national security for her own convenience or to
[02:05:38.360 --> 02:05:42.800]  cover up her misdeeds if national security is more important than the
[02:05:42.800 --> 02:05:47.480]  Constitution if national security is more important than our rights why
[02:05:47.480 --> 02:05:52.920]  isn't Hillary being prosecuted why is Snowden called a traitor and Hillary
[02:05:52.920 --> 02:05:59.360]  Clinton is called presidential material for info wars I'm David Knight most of

[02:09:37.840 --> 02:09:43.920]  Hillary it's certainly ripe for it just a three four weeks ago we weren't sure
[02:09:43.920 --> 02:09:50.800]  but it appeared possible but Steve and then we'll go to Jared Kevin Roger Allen
[02:09:50.800 --> 02:09:54.160]  and others Steve if you just joined us got cut off by the break and he brought
[02:09:54.160 --> 02:09:59.080]  up a really good point he believes it's the post-tribulation or pre-tribulation
[02:09:59.080 --> 02:10:04.880]  rapture pre-tribulation rapture that's before Christ comes back that is the
[02:10:04.880 --> 02:10:10.280]  ultimate reason Christians aren't politically involved anymore and in
[02:10:10.280 --> 02:10:16.320]  1776 the war against the corrupt British crown an empire never defeated by Spain
[02:10:16.320 --> 02:10:25.880]  or France or anybody else not Russia not the Dutch no one England when wars you
[02:10:25.880 --> 02:10:31.840]  know two to one well they were out number two to one never defeated but
[02:10:31.840 --> 02:10:37.280]  defeated by a very small force led by the black brigades because in those days
[02:10:37.280 --> 02:10:42.480]  all the priests whether they be Presbyterian or Methodist or Baptist or
[02:10:42.480 --> 02:10:47.840]  Catholic war black many of more white collars that was the uniform and it was
[02:10:47.840 --> 02:10:53.240]  the black brigade that really was the heart and so around that time you can
[02:10:53.240 --> 02:10:59.600]  go back to after the war the British and others began to fund a movement to put
[02:10:59.600 --> 02:11:03.200]  out the idea through different Masonic channels and I'm not bashing Masons but
[02:11:03.200 --> 02:11:09.320]  that's the channels they use you can look this up through really Baptist
[02:11:09.320 --> 02:11:19.800]  groups to promote a pre-tribulation rapture now East shack and all the rest
[02:11:19.800 --> 02:11:26.480]  of those folks and the lion's den and the fiery furnace and Jesus Christ and the
[02:11:26.480 --> 02:11:32.320]  prophet that said he was coming John the Baptist and almost every other prophet
[02:11:32.320 --> 02:11:38.800]  or disciple were boiled in oil crucified upside down heads chopped off tortured
[02:11:38.800 --> 02:11:49.560]  to death stoned to death flayed to death beaten to death burned to death but we're
[02:11:49.560 --> 02:12:02.040]  told that that's not the case now we're told now that there is a transponder
[02:12:02.040 --> 02:12:09.440]  teleporter up on a giant enterprise spaceship with Scotty and with Captain
[02:12:09.440 --> 02:12:18.120]  Kirk and Spock is there and they sit there and teleport people up so they
[02:12:18.120 --> 02:12:22.840]  won't have to face any evil and so I don't care what church you go to the big
[02:12:22.840 --> 02:12:27.080]  main line ones can be Catholic whatever to be Protestant it's and we're all
[02:12:27.080 --> 02:12:30.440]  gonna be teleported out of here before anything happens and airplanes are all
[02:12:30.440 --> 02:12:33.560]  gonna crash all the stuff's gonna happen and I'm not attacking people that push
[02:12:33.560 --> 02:12:38.320]  that today they're well-meaning but it comes out of the doctrine just like
[02:12:38.320 --> 02:12:43.000]  Romans 13 out of context to say submit to what the government does no Christ was
[02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:48.160]  smart when they wanted to stoning he said render under Caesar the things that
[02:12:48.160 --> 02:12:52.080]  are Caesar's you know who is it on that coin and the Pharisees say it's it's
[02:12:52.080 --> 02:12:57.880]  Caesar it's his system you got an American Express card you're under
[02:12:57.880 --> 02:13:01.400]  American Express rules you got a visa card you're under their rules you're in
[02:13:01.400 --> 02:13:07.520]  my house you're under my rules so render the things the Caesar the deceasers to
[02:13:07.520 --> 02:13:14.920]  God give what's God's and they put it Bible getaway above it submission to
[02:13:14.920 --> 02:13:20.000]  governing authorities that's that's not in the Bible vote those terms it is out
[02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:24.440]  of context it is a total throttle woman why did the early Christians not do it
[02:13:24.440 --> 02:13:33.880]  Nero said and worship bathroom it worship Saturn or Zeus or Bacchus or
[02:13:33.880 --> 02:13:43.280]  Janus I mean any idiot knows that Romans 13 is out of context and a complete
[02:13:43.280 --> 02:13:48.920]  fraud or Christ broke the rules when he didn't submit to the Roman and Jewish
[02:13:48.920 --> 02:14:00.200]  authorities and so did Paul I mean it's just on its face ridiculous but people
[02:14:00.200 --> 02:14:04.640]  are taught to plus two equals five and that raising the debt limit doesn't raise
[02:14:04.640 --> 02:14:07.800]  the debt limit and that you didn't build your business and that Obamacare is free
[02:14:07.800 --> 02:14:12.840]  I mean it's all lies and I hear these fake Christians calling these radio
[02:14:12.840 --> 02:14:16.040]  shows you feel real satisfied repeating a talking point about just do what you're
[02:14:16.040 --> 02:14:21.280]  told marry the gay person well why don't you use the word homosexual again I
[02:14:21.280 --> 02:14:25.720]  don't anything against quote gay people to use that term I have a problem that
[02:14:25.720 --> 02:14:31.080]  they first say use the term gay be nice to me but why do you get the word happy
[02:14:31.080 --> 02:14:37.160]  beautiful green day happy beautiful sunny it was a gay day he was a gay lad
[02:14:37.160 --> 02:14:43.480]  which means happy joyful people like come on be nice call them what they want to
[02:14:43.480 --> 02:14:48.240]  be called okay well you know I want to be called you know Rumpelstil skin okay
[02:14:48.240 --> 02:14:51.440]  we don't want to hurt your feelings your Rumpelstil skin I want to be called a
[02:14:51.440 --> 02:14:56.440]  toaster now in England they arrest you if you use the word homosexual I mean I'm
[02:14:56.440 --> 02:15:00.200]  not joking because groups say it's hateful well now the word boy and girl
[02:15:00.200 --> 02:15:08.720]  is hateful or man or woman or husband or wife and so it's the same thing where
[02:15:08.720 --> 02:15:14.080]  language is now being dictated to us and being controlled and if you'll follow
[02:15:14.080 --> 02:15:18.240]  the edict of using the words someone else says like there's a political
[02:15:18.240 --> 02:15:24.160]  correct movement of ignorance where they say don't use the word Negro and I've
[02:15:24.160 --> 02:15:27.760]  heard of the stories of people when they order at the bar I want to Negro
[02:15:27.760 --> 02:15:34.280]  Madelo that just means black and Spanish people get mad what's that the n-word and
[02:15:34.280 --> 02:15:38.120]  this is people looking for the racism everywhere but right above them is the
[02:15:38.120 --> 02:15:42.320]  big Planned Parenthood mothership sworn to kill every black person they can get
[02:15:42.320 --> 02:15:46.320]  their hands on oh that's okay because they're in the black community and they
[02:15:46.320 --> 02:15:55.560]  care about us Jesse Jackson said so so I will use the word Caucasian I will use
[02:15:55.560 --> 02:16:02.560]  the word Negro I will use the word homosexual or heterosexual Caucasian
[02:16:02.560 --> 02:16:13.320]  just means caucus mountains it's just ridiculous it has nothing to do with
[02:16:13.320 --> 02:16:22.080]  anything it's total mindlessness it's like if I call white people white and
[02:16:22.080 --> 02:16:28.320]  black people black it has nothing to do with anything Buckley had a really funny
[02:16:28.320 --> 02:16:30.720]  image I told him to give it to me I forgot to get it and tweet it out
[02:16:30.720 --> 02:16:37.320]  Buckley he'll give that to the guys and tweet it out and we should tweet the
[02:16:37.320 --> 02:16:42.920]  idea that all non-black labs be banned because they're obviously racist because
[02:16:42.920 --> 02:16:48.600]  they're golden or they're white or they're chocolate but it says black labs
[02:16:48.600 --> 02:16:53.480]  matter and next to it all labs matter there it is I mean that it's the exact
[02:16:53.480 --> 02:17:00.600]  same dog they just got different hair man and it's the same idiocy it is the
[02:17:00.600 --> 02:17:07.800]  same absolute mindless moron behavior that the Democratic Party won't even
[02:17:07.800 --> 02:17:13.320]  say that all lives matter and has apologized twice for for different
[02:17:13.320 --> 02:17:18.240]  Democrats saying no all lives matter no all lives do matter and if we don't think
[02:17:18.240 --> 02:17:25.880]  all lives matter then none of our lives matter but the rapture is a fraud there's
[02:17:25.880 --> 02:17:33.920]  a battle of Armageddon Christ comes back the dead in Christ are raised and then
[02:17:33.920 --> 02:17:37.680]  those living spend a thousand years with Christ here on earth that's what the
[02:17:37.680 --> 02:17:44.000]  Bible says and they've got it that there's a teleporter machine whatever
[02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:48.480]  let's just say God the devil isn't real for the sake of argument I'm going to
[02:17:48.480 --> 02:17:52.400]  fight putting fluoride in the water I'm gonna fight aborting babies and selling
[02:17:52.400 --> 02:17:58.440]  their body parts and I don't care if twiddly D and twiddly dumb preachers get
[02:17:58.440 --> 02:18:03.760]  up there on television in front of their crowds and follow their 501c3 and give
[02:18:03.760 --> 02:18:08.440]  their government script Stephen finish up your points brother thanks for
[02:18:08.440 --> 02:18:13.800]  holding yeah thank you yeah just want to say this okay I bring up different
[02:18:13.800 --> 02:18:18.240]  points to Christian about what a planned parent has been doing and how you've
[02:18:18.240 --> 02:18:23.680]  shown that they're putting DNA and baby parts in the vaccine you know what's
[02:18:23.680 --> 02:18:27.280]  happening with Christian business owners around the country like Aaron and
[02:18:27.280 --> 02:18:32.160]  Melissa Klein up there in Portland, Oregon or Baron L. Stuckman in Washington
[02:18:32.160 --> 02:18:35.720]  at the Sodom like communities going after using the government to do it and
[02:18:35.720 --> 02:18:40.920]  now this woman Kim Davis in Kentucky this county clerk the plan make is that
[02:18:40.920 --> 02:18:43.760]  when I bring these things up the automatic response and it's like
[02:18:43.760 --> 02:18:49.360]  Pavlovian oh it's just another sign that the Lord's return is imminent and he's
[02:18:49.360 --> 02:18:52.560]  gonna split that eastern sky and we're all gonna be out of here and I'm trying
[02:18:52.560 --> 02:18:56.960]  to tell them that the exact mentality of Christians in a manatee today is where
[02:18:56.960 --> 02:19:02.600]  the church was at in 1920s Germany prior to Hitler taking over and they got
[02:19:02.600 --> 02:19:07.200]  wiped out the same thing happened in Korea and Vietnam the church got wiped
[02:19:07.200 --> 02:19:10.760]  out there when the Communists came in because they were not doing what the
[02:19:10.760 --> 02:19:14.400]  Apostles admonished the church in the first century and that was if you're
[02:19:14.400 --> 02:19:18.880]  gonna follow Jesus Christ you will be persecuted and you're not gonna escape
[02:19:18.880 --> 02:19:22.600]  what's coming so you might as well just reckon with it and stand for what's true
[02:19:22.600 --> 02:19:26.880]  and preach the gospel come what may you may be fed to the lions and the
[02:19:26.880 --> 02:19:30.720]  calcium but you have eternal life but these people in America today out to the
[02:19:30.720 --> 02:19:34.680]  most part they're scared to death they don't want to suffer they don't want to
[02:19:34.680 --> 02:19:38.240]  lay their lives down like they say they do and I've been telling everybody this

[02:24:39.320 --> 02:24:42.000]  his books pretty smart guy I agree with him a lot of historical perspectives
[02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:50.320]  saying sex is about power well maybe in his weird homoerotic world it was about
[02:24:50.320 --> 02:24:57.840]  power in my world it's about love it's about pleasure it's about trust it's
[02:24:57.840 --> 02:25:04.040]  about intimacy it's about enjoyment it's about stress relief it's about most
[02:25:04.040 --> 02:25:10.280]  importantly procreation and let's not forget why it's the main drive the on
[02:25:10.280 --> 02:25:20.560]  food and water folks it's sex and it's because it's why we exist it's the
[02:25:20.560 --> 02:25:26.560]  driving force of procreation of reproduction and when you target that
[02:25:26.560 --> 02:25:31.160]  you target the species and I look at the entire attack system the entire attack
[02:25:31.160 --> 02:25:36.960]  checklist of what we're under and it is what I would do a lot of space aliens
[02:25:36.960 --> 02:25:40.360]  here masquerading as humans if I wanted to kill humanity I mean that that's it
[02:25:40.360 --> 02:25:45.120]  the I'm not saying it's space aliens you know that I'm just saying if I was a
[02:25:45.120 --> 02:25:50.480]  robot computer analyzing this I would say alien intelligence you know crime
[02:25:50.480 --> 02:25:54.280]  analysis masquerading as humans on service of earth overthrow of
[02:25:54.280 --> 02:25:58.760]  civilization cutting off energy supplies stifling development enslaving
[02:25:58.760 --> 02:26:03.000]  public dumbing down population attacking fertility rates stifling space
[02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:09.120]  exploration for operation termination of population prime projection bio weapons
[02:26:09.120 --> 02:26:13.040]  developed by alien species after weakening a population will cause mass
[02:26:13.040 --> 02:26:20.840]  collapse and eradication of homo sapien sapien on planet Terra that's basically
[02:26:20.840 --> 02:26:26.120]  yet because science fiction movie like the thing where it says you know how
[02:26:26.120 --> 02:26:31.680]  many hours till total world population infected 3,785 hours prime
[02:26:31.680 --> 02:26:37.720]  projection 98% I mean it's like that and I'm just sitting here watching the
[02:26:37.720 --> 02:26:41.240]  robots go online reading the elites books how they're gonna kill everybody and
[02:26:41.240 --> 02:26:44.440]  I'm just like oh and now they're gonna shut the roads down and put taxes by the
[02:26:44.440 --> 02:26:50.120]  mile and now they're gonna and it and I'm just sitting here watching it yeah

[02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:21.720]  upsetting me well talking about being fired up one of the 45 50 million strong
[02:27:21.720 --> 02:27:29.760]  in the United States depending on which statistic that you look at the disabled
[02:27:29.760 --> 02:27:37.880]  community I happen to be in the blind demographic or if you want to be
[02:27:37.880 --> 02:27:49.760]  politically correct visually impaired side challenged you know you talk a lot
[02:27:49.760 --> 02:27:58.360]  since I found you anyway over the past three weeks or a month about the
[02:27:58.360 --> 02:28:04.920]  domination that we're under by our federal government my question deals
[02:28:04.920 --> 02:28:13.120]  with the Declaration of Independence the the question kind of goes like this to
[02:28:13.120 --> 02:28:18.400]  agree that the Declaration of Independence is the foundational document
[02:28:18.400 --> 02:28:25.200]  on which the Constitution rests yes it is the kickoff of the whole shebang more
[02:28:25.200 --> 02:28:29.640]  important than the Constitution and the Bill of Rights it states it's our
[02:28:29.640 --> 02:28:34.320]  right is sentient individuals to throw off the bonds of an enslaving
[02:28:34.320 --> 02:28:38.600]  government when it engages in these type of infractions and you read what was
[02:28:38.600 --> 02:28:44.160]  done within the lead-up to July 4 1776 and the signing of the Declaration the
[02:28:44.160 --> 02:28:50.480]  unanimous Declaration of Independence and it is a shadow of the flagrant abuse
[02:28:50.480 --> 02:28:57.520]  and tyranny we languish under today I would stand in agreement with you on
[02:28:57.520 --> 02:29:08.160]  that sir in the first couple of sentences of the Declaration of Independence I
[02:29:08.160 --> 02:29:15.200]  believe you're alluding to this a second ago it's our right our duty well our
[02:29:15.200 --> 02:29:22.760]  duty our responsibility to throw off to throw off a tyrannical government in
[02:29:22.760 --> 02:29:25.800]  fact you know people shouldn't dissolve governments lightlier for transient
[02:29:25.800 --> 02:29:30.000]  means but when in the course of human events it becomes time to admit you're
[02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:33.240]  under a tyranny it's got to be done to paraphrase stay there I'm gonna come back

[02:34:11.080 --> 02:34:16.800]  good and everything you know we are simulcasting also on the radio TV at
[02:34:16.800 --> 02:34:22.560]  info wars dot com forward slash show and the power of you the people of we the
[02:34:22.560 --> 02:34:27.040]  people taking that link and sending it to friends and family and neighbors and
[02:34:27.040 --> 02:34:32.120]  Facebook and Twitter is exponential and that's why we're in the top six
[02:34:32.120 --> 02:34:36.960]  terrestrial radio shows and you can see clearly the number one political news
[02:34:36.960 --> 02:34:43.440]  talk show in the world by every major metric of course the ultimate brass ring
[02:34:43.440 --> 02:34:47.840]  victory is in political today goes to Matt drudge congratulations this is about
[02:34:47.840 --> 02:34:52.720]  the 15th year running I've seen I have to admit this more traffic in political
[02:34:52.720 --> 02:34:59.000]  news and news in general than Facebook and of course the New York Times and
[02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:03.680]  other publications combined and Politico certainly doesn't like having to report
[02:35:03.680 --> 02:35:08.880]  that to everyone that's a testament of the David versus Goliath that what does
[02:35:08.880 --> 02:35:11.920]  drugs do he links to government documents he links to YouTube videos he
[02:35:11.920 --> 02:35:17.320]  links to mainstream media he links to alternative media he just links to what's
[02:35:17.320 --> 02:35:21.760]  interesting and he's got his finger on the pulse of that I mean drudge has been
[02:35:21.760 --> 02:35:25.120]  linking us for 10 years we were growing before I ever did that but you know when
[02:35:25.120 --> 02:35:29.120]  drudge links does half our traffic of the day is a drudge link so instead of
[02:35:29.120 --> 02:35:33.200]  getting a million visitors we get two million visitors and of course they
[02:35:33.200 --> 02:35:36.800]  whitewash and say drudge has two million original visitors a day up give me a
[02:35:36.800 --> 02:35:42.400]  break I can look at the metrics just on the Google Analytics alone if we've got
[02:35:42.400 --> 02:35:47.600]  over a million visitors a day just to info wars and I can see drudge he's
[02:35:47.600 --> 02:35:51.480]  probably getting 10 million individual visitors a day conservatively but again
[02:35:51.480 --> 02:35:56.160]  so even when they admit he's number one they give a little backhanded bologna slap
[02:35:56.160 --> 02:36:00.840]  but it doesn't matter just like Alexa just delisted every libertarian and
[02:36:00.840 --> 02:36:03.960]  conservative side basically a year ago now everybody just admits they're a
[02:36:03.960 --> 02:36:08.400]  joke according to them we have no viewers no listeners it's all over even
[02:36:08.400 --> 02:36:11.720]  though we're going straight up on the Google internal stuff and every other
[02:36:11.720 --> 02:36:15.560]  metric we've got and I don't want to digress I said I'd go to your phone
[02:36:15.560 --> 02:36:21.040]  calls and the caller just hung up from Colorado I was gonna go back to him
[02:36:21.040 --> 02:36:27.400]  Kevin in Florida go ahead you're on the air thank you so much Alex I just want
[02:36:27.400 --> 02:36:31.440]  to say me and my brother a huge supporter is you guys a show thank you buying
[02:36:31.440 --> 02:36:34.840]  of the t-shirts to the hardcore nutraceuticals which are awesome I
[02:36:34.840 --> 02:36:39.400]  see some silver bullet this morning from nice nine nine as well so they're
[02:36:39.400 --> 02:36:43.960]  awesome we appreciate that thank you but my question to you is about this whole
[02:36:43.960 --> 02:36:49.720]  cashless society thing I realize now that a lot of companies are strictly going
[02:36:49.720 --> 02:36:54.280]  to where you have to get direct deposit or these ridiculous money cards great
[02:36:54.280 --> 02:36:58.600]  point the big six banks or the big five banks now said two years ago they got a
[02:36:58.600 --> 02:37:02.400]  war on cash they're gonna phase it out so they can then tax you
[02:37:02.400 --> 02:37:06.240]  corporate-leaded to have even have money in their banks and when you make a
[02:37:06.240 --> 02:37:10.200]  purchase they're gonna tax you a huge amount so it's a huge scam they're
[02:37:10.200 --> 02:37:14.400]  competing with cash and yes companies businesses corporations they're trying
[02:37:14.400 --> 02:37:17.920]  to make you do automatic money transfers they're trying to make you only use
[02:37:17.920 --> 02:37:23.600]  credit cards now businesses big corporations won't try to take a 20 I
[02:37:23.600 --> 02:37:29.800]  don't usually go to Amazon not Amazon same the coffee place with a stupid
[02:37:29.800 --> 02:37:33.960]  goddess Starbucks excuse you have had one of those moments I start trying to
[02:37:33.960 --> 02:37:38.120]  hurry to get your calls and then I forget basic stuff but I was in a small
[02:37:38.120 --> 02:37:42.960]  town with my kids it was a Starbucks it's better than McDonald's I went there
[02:37:42.960 --> 02:37:46.880]  got some milk and apples and stuff and I gave them a 50 and I was buying like
[02:37:46.880 --> 02:37:51.160]  $25 with stuff a couple coffees you know drinks all stuff and they go sir do
[02:37:51.160 --> 02:37:55.880]  you have anything smaller I said this isn't a hundred but a hundred didn't
[02:37:55.880 --> 02:37:59.120]  even want it used to be they said well sir they didn't want us to take cash and
[02:37:59.120 --> 02:38:04.760]  more and more that's what you see so yeah sorry go ahead Kevin no I agree I
[02:38:04.760 --> 02:38:09.280]  recently found out to you that a lot of the reasons not just because of the
[02:38:09.280 --> 02:38:13.040]  reasons that you stated but the corporations get major major tax breaks
[02:38:13.040 --> 02:38:17.240]  if they do this like you said so they can tax it and I think it's funny cuz
[02:38:17.240 --> 02:38:21.080]  me and my brother always joke about it like the reactions that you get from
[02:38:21.080 --> 02:38:25.960]  other people when you spend with cash I try and pay totally in cash and
[02:38:25.960 --> 02:38:30.440]  everybody automatically thinks you're a drug dealer or it's just the just the
[02:38:30.440 --> 02:38:33.760]  looks that you get and then when you let you say when you pay with a 20 they
[02:38:33.760 --> 02:38:37.360]  bring out the market and make sure it's real and I just think like you said it's
[02:38:37.360 --> 02:38:41.520]  just it's another way for total and utter control by the government well look
[02:38:41.520 --> 02:38:45.480]  at all the control with the credit card numbers getting stolen I mean every
[02:38:45.480 --> 02:38:49.680]  couple months they call up and go your credit cards canceled that was
[02:38:49.680 --> 02:38:53.920]  compromised I mean that's probably happened five times this year everybody I
[02:38:53.920 --> 02:38:58.560]  know is having their accounts grabbed stuff stolen I mean it because it's
[02:38:58.560 --> 02:39:02.920]  designed to not work to make us go to biometrics they admit that to thomas
[02:39:02.920 --> 02:39:07.480]  scan face scan when you use a card so absolutely we got to keep cash alive
[02:39:07.480 --> 02:39:12.960]  we've got to use it as much as we can because once they've gotten rid of cash
[02:39:12.960 --> 02:39:18.800]  Katie bar the door I appreciate your call great point let's just take one more
[02:39:18.800 --> 02:39:22.040]  call and I'll have Anthony report his news I'll get to those then come back to
[02:39:22.040 --> 02:39:28.040]  Brian Jared and Steve but let's go to Gerald you know Arkansas first you're
[02:39:28.040 --> 02:39:33.320]  on the air he wants to talk about a bank system scam go ahead well the biggest
[02:39:33.320 --> 02:39:39.160]  scam Alex the first the Bible I know you believe the Bible King James version for
[02:39:39.160 --> 02:39:45.360]  me but yes first you fix 10 the love of money is a root of all evil the problem
[02:39:45.360 --> 02:39:49.720]  is our founding father said the only real money has to be backed by gold or
[02:39:49.720 --> 02:39:54.000]  silver that's still in effect now unless you mend the Constitution that's not
[02:39:54.000 --> 02:40:03.120]  changed so no debt can be paid with with fiat currency so where we're at now the
[02:40:03.120 --> 02:40:07.200]  digital age Alex and I know you know all this but I'm I don't think the public
[02:40:07.200 --> 02:40:11.920]  really gets it and I'm talking about your followers and most everybody I've
[02:40:11.920 --> 02:40:18.240]  talked to when you went to trillions Alex it blows the mind that people lose
[02:40:18.240 --> 02:40:22.400]  all perspective because you can't be real talking about trillions there's not
[02:40:22.400 --> 02:40:27.760]  enough ink and paper to print that so they get on a computer what power that
[02:40:27.760 --> 02:40:32.160]  is that's the biggest scam of all and now they've created not just fashion
[02:40:32.160 --> 02:40:36.080]  reserve banking in the last 200 years well they have $1 in the bank and loan
[02:40:36.080 --> 02:40:41.200]  out 10 or $1,000 loan out 10,000 then they started making all these
[02:40:41.200 --> 02:40:47.440]  derivatives there's hundreds of different corporate devices or corporate
[02:40:47.440 --> 02:40:52.640]  instruments where they'll sell the same house a hundred times oh but they don't
[02:40:52.640 --> 02:40:56.280]  get in trouble for fraud the same big banks running the aircraft that ship
[02:40:56.280 --> 02:41:00.760]  the drugs laundering the drug money paying the hit man but when you go in
[02:41:00.760 --> 02:41:05.360]  and you're going to buy dinner for say six seven people you're with and it's
[02:41:05.360 --> 02:41:09.200]  $75 and you give them a hundred the waitress looks at you like you're
[02:41:09.200 --> 02:41:14.720]  al-Qaeda this is legal tender P-brain it says fellow reserve on it it is a
[02:41:14.720 --> 02:41:19.960]  fraud but it's less of a fraud than the digital so when they get me trouble
[02:41:19.960 --> 02:41:25.440]  about cash baby you get a speech my kids used to go oh please dad now they give
[02:41:25.440 --> 02:41:28.480]  the speech or or they'll check it to see if it's
[02:41:28.480 --> 02:41:32.520]  counterfeit and I go ma'am all the money's counterfeit they go excuse me and
[02:41:32.520 --> 02:41:37.680]  I go well you just marked my 50 or my 20 with a little marker to see if it's real
[02:41:37.680 --> 02:41:44.120]  it's all federal reserve note it should say US note even that's fiat but at least
[02:41:44.120 --> 02:41:48.520]  it's a US note you understand the federal reserve's private and now people
[02:41:48.520 --> 02:41:52.120]  seem to know it I appreciate your call great point Gerald excellent point we'll
[02:41:52.120 --> 02:41:55.160]  get to everybody else it's holding before the transmission ends I've got a
[02:41:55.160 --> 02:41:59.600]  lot of news to cover in a short time to get there Anthony Uchiarty is one of
[02:41:59.600 --> 02:42:03.840]  our health writers here and I wanted him to come in because he was telling me
[02:42:03.840 --> 02:42:07.840]  about some amazing news developments he's gonna be writing on Anthony tell us
[02:42:07.840 --> 02:42:10.920]  about some of these new developments well there's a new study that anti-
[02:42:10.920 --> 02:42:14.840]  psychotic drugs actually shrink brain matter and we'll talk about that a
[02:42:14.840 --> 02:42:18.000]  little bit we've got how many times have I said it shrinks your brain a
[02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:21.600]  million times we've riddled it really does it at a roll really does it it
[02:42:21.600 --> 02:42:24.400]  actually shrinks the brain up to one-third it makes you feel like a
[02:42:24.400 --> 02:42:28.960]  total zombie then we have a weird little story here that's interesting to me
[02:42:28.960 --> 02:42:32.760]  psychopaths may not yawn along with you so you know how yawns are contagious
[02:42:32.760 --> 02:42:35.680]  apparently psychopaths are so self-centered and their brains are so
[02:42:35.680 --> 02:42:40.080]  wired differently that they won't catch yawns is that called psychosomatic when
[02:42:40.080 --> 02:42:43.520]  somebody farts you want to fart I'm sorry to be gross but that's true or
[02:42:43.520 --> 02:42:46.480]  somebody burps you want to burp or somebody yawns you want to yawn yeah
[02:42:46.480 --> 02:42:49.600]  it's all contagious because your brain Hillary you want to Hillary you want to
[02:42:49.600 --> 02:42:53.320]  Hillary that's what I want to do I want to do the Hillary laugh and then Alzheimer's
[02:42:53.320 --> 02:42:56.960]  disease may be infectious we can get into that that's pretty weird genetically
[02:42:56.960 --> 02:43:01.400]  modified embryos are essential for science experts and scientists want to
[02:43:01.400 --> 02:43:05.520]  start modifying human embryos they've already done GMO babies and now they
[02:43:05.520 --> 02:43:08.480]  want to get and they've already been doing this for 30 years they're just
[02:43:08.480 --> 02:43:11.640]  getting around to slaves right now remember that weird article that I
[02:43:11.640 --> 02:43:14.640]  actually have trouble finding now that we covered a long time ago about the
[02:43:14.640 --> 02:43:17.920]  chimeras the secret chimeras in the UK that they were busting and stuff like
[02:43:17.920 --> 02:43:21.720]  half-human weird monkey things and stuff like that that was even the Washington
[02:43:21.720 --> 02:43:25.280]  post to about 12 years ago and they've been doing that for who knows how long
[02:43:25.280 --> 02:43:28.640]  now they're like well maybe we want to have GMO embryos they've been doing it
[02:43:28.640 --> 02:43:32.400]  forever but the thing is it's gonna be accepted publicly now so it's gonna be
[02:43:32.400 --> 02:43:36.360]  even bigger and more hardcore yeah the Defense Department made humans he's at
[02:43:36.360 --> 02:43:40.640]  least 30 years ago that's even admitted the congressional record and then I tell
[02:43:40.640 --> 02:43:43.680]  people that and they roll their eyes folks they can have a human spider if
[02:43:43.680 --> 02:43:48.520]  they want spider goat sure that's like 25 years old yeah but people still don't
[02:43:48.520 --> 02:43:51.080]  believe it they think you're insane they think you're making it up by the way
[02:43:51.080 --> 02:43:55.120]  I've read about that but then I saw it in a Rochester newspaper or listeners
[02:43:55.120 --> 02:44:01.240]  sent it to us of our oldest affiliates is in Rochester Dr. Wolf station and I
[02:44:01.240 --> 02:44:05.600]  got the CEO of the Defense Department contract company on when no one knew
[02:44:05.600 --> 02:44:10.920]  about spider-goats like 18 years ago and people didn't believe it when he was on
[02:44:10.920 --> 02:44:14.440]  they thought it was a hoax I can say we broke spider-goats I've seen it in you
[02:44:14.440 --> 02:44:18.080]  know a local paper but we broke it nationally the Defense Department came
[02:44:18.080 --> 02:44:21.480]  to that guy and threatened he must do interviews anymore Wow so back then it
[02:44:21.480 --> 02:44:25.680]  was like Alex is making up part spider part go and that was 18 years ago who
[02:44:25.680 --> 02:44:28.200]  knows what they're doing now and you're still you're still sound crazy though
[02:44:28.200 --> 02:44:30.840]  when you say spider-goats people will still tell you they don't exist that's
[02:44:30.840 --> 02:44:34.120]  why I talk about spider-goats a lot as most people do know that's now around
[02:44:34.120 --> 02:44:39.480]  mm-hmm but I mean they've got here's why they do it if they take an embryo and
[02:44:39.480 --> 02:44:43.560]  splice it with a cow or a pig 1% they can claim it's not human doesn't have
[02:44:43.560 --> 02:44:48.840]  rights so they're just trying to get us ready for the main lining of this now
[02:44:48.840 --> 02:44:52.440]  but I remember the Washington Post reported and folks I've tried to find
[02:44:52.440 --> 02:44:55.840]  it again if you can find it we'll send you a free t-shirt or if somebody can
[02:44:55.840 --> 02:45:02.800]  find it was about 17 years ago this is the 14th anniversary of 9-11 coming up
[02:45:02.800 --> 02:45:07.000]  so this was a few years before that but 17 years ago there was a Baltimore Sun
[02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:12.400]  article about DARPA and I forget the headline but it admitted that they were
[02:45:12.400 --> 02:45:16.560]  hooking up the cell towers and that they were practicing calming the public with
[02:45:16.560 --> 02:45:21.760]  wavelengths now we have the patents but here they were saying the cell towers
[02:45:21.760 --> 02:45:27.920]  are making people submit and passive and putting them in a suggestive state and
[02:45:27.920 --> 02:45:31.560]  I probably covered that article 20 times on air but I was male the actual
[02:45:31.560 --> 02:45:37.360]  Baltimore Sun I hope somebody can find that Wow I remember you talking about
[02:45:37.360 --> 02:45:40.840]  that but I'd yeah it seems like for some reason just like the Chimera
[02:45:40.840 --> 02:45:45.040]  article the articles disappear and it's obviously because they're deleted but
[02:45:45.040 --> 02:45:48.040]  it's more challenging than you think to find something that's like the San
[02:45:48.040 --> 02:45:52.880]  Francisco Chronicle went to a meeting eight years ago nine years ago we can
[02:45:52.880 --> 02:45:57.920]  check it just Google any matter weapons San Francisco Chronicle they added to
[02:45:57.920 --> 02:46:01.640]  the article but they left some of it in there and they went and they admitted
[02:46:01.640 --> 02:46:05.840]  yeah we have any matter weapons and we're developing more and then they
[02:46:05.840 --> 02:46:11.080]  suddenly tried to classify all that mm-hmm you know think about all the
[02:46:11.080 --> 02:46:14.840]  stuff we know in times that by a billion or as the caller earlier was saying
[02:46:14.840 --> 02:46:18.560]  trillion such an incapable number of understanding on our primate brains
[02:46:18.560 --> 02:46:21.800]  times what we already know they're doing times a trillion and that's what's
[02:46:21.800 --> 02:46:26.320]  really going on and try and put that I think it's that bad I mean if you think
[02:46:26.320 --> 02:46:30.080]  about that I think they're acting so arrogant they've broken into something
[02:46:30.080 --> 02:46:34.240]  or discovered something where it's like this world isn't even it's like they're
[02:46:34.240 --> 02:46:39.800]  not even here anymore the elite act like this is nothing they had computer-based
[02:46:39.800 --> 02:46:43.760]  systems in what the 60s and 50s and we just when my dad was at UT in the late
[02:46:43.760 --> 02:46:49.080]  60s they had CD ROM systems that were quote restricted under DARPA but he was
[02:46:49.080 --> 02:46:52.160]  allowed in as a as one of the higher-level students and they told them
[02:46:52.160 --> 02:46:55.320]  they had to sign agreements not to talk about it and we were getting personal
[02:46:55.320 --> 02:46:59.480]  computers which were super super not powerful at all in the 90s and now we're
[02:46:59.480 --> 02:47:03.640]  getting consumer grade laptops and stuff like that the technology that is it's
[02:47:03.640 --> 02:47:09.200]  the exists is it'll blow your mind it's it's totally outlandish all right now
[02:47:09.200 --> 02:47:14.040]  one reason I got you in here is the hourly plug you are better at
[02:47:14.040 --> 02:47:17.680]  articulating why brain force has such great reviews why the staff loves it
[02:47:17.680 --> 02:47:22.120]  why it's clean energy brain force it helps from the operation I want to have
[02:47:22.120 --> 02:47:25.440]  the ultimate brain pill the blue and the competition for lower price tell people
[02:47:25.440 --> 02:47:29.000]  what's in brain force it's back all right well brain force is probably one of
[02:47:29.000 --> 02:47:34.120]  my top favorite infowars life products I mean it was it works for me in like 10
[02:47:34.120 --> 02:47:37.320]  minutes and what the difference is though some of these pills and energy
[02:47:37.320 --> 02:47:40.640]  drinks and shots and stuff's just a ton of concentrated caffeine you feel
[02:47:40.640 --> 02:47:44.080]  terrible afterwards you crash you might get jittered up kind of speedy for a
[02:47:44.080 --> 02:47:47.680]  little while and then you feel bad afterwards the difference is these
[02:47:47.680 --> 02:47:51.240]  compounds work synergistically I'm going to break them down a little bit so if
[02:47:51.240 --> 02:47:56.040]  alpha gps alpha gpc which we always talk about in Europe is a prescription
[02:47:56.040 --> 02:48:00.520]  medication okay we're not making any claims here but what it does is it's
[02:48:00.520 --> 02:48:04.160]  known to increase a compound known as acetylcholine which is memory and
[02:48:04.160 --> 02:48:07.120]  learning functions stuff like that but that's just in addition to all these
[02:48:07.120 --> 02:48:10.120]  other things are giving energy like the L-theanine which is a key component in
[02:48:10.120 --> 02:48:13.640]  green tea that everyone probably knows about it increases dopamine the feel
[02:48:13.640 --> 02:48:18.040]  good chemicals in the brain and then we have theanine and natural caffeine from
[02:48:18.040 --> 02:48:21.560]  Yerba mate leaf powder instead of putting a bunch of synthetic junk in there we
[02:48:21.560 --> 02:48:25.280]  have Yerba mate instead of drinking a ton of Yerba mate you take this pill
[02:48:25.280 --> 02:48:29.520]  which it works synergistically with the rest of it and phosphatidylserine the
[02:48:29.520 --> 02:48:32.880]  reason that brain force has been sold out for so long is this key component
[02:48:32.880 --> 02:48:36.480]  phosphatidylserine you're gonna understand why in a second so it works
[02:48:36.480 --> 02:48:40.720]  with the maintenance of the cells in the brain but historically people wanted
[02:48:40.720 --> 02:48:45.080]  this so bad it was never in supply because they had to get it from cow brains
[02:48:45.080 --> 02:48:48.960]  that's how powerful this is they would go and extract it from cow brains that's
[02:48:48.960 --> 02:48:52.200]  not safe because the spongiform itself a lot of exactly so we're not going to
[02:48:52.200 --> 02:48:55.680]  have that happen but we found out a way to get it from cabbage so we're
[02:48:55.680 --> 02:48:58.880]  harvesting it from cabbage but since it's been transferred from the cow brain
[02:48:58.880 --> 02:49:02.360]  to cabbage it's in such demand that the supplies are very limited so we just
[02:49:02.360 --> 02:49:05.480]  finally got the phosphatidylserine back for the product we refuse to take it
[02:49:05.480 --> 02:49:10.520]  out still in the product and the hyperzine a which another time I mentioned
[02:49:10.520 --> 02:49:13.880]  last time I think big pharma is going to turn hyperzine a into a prescription
[02:49:13.880 --> 02:49:16.480]  medication in the United States they're already looking at it so I don't know
[02:49:16.480 --> 02:49:20.560]  how much longer we can have it in this formula but it is super powerful it helps
[02:49:20.560 --> 02:49:23.200]  the nerves communicate with the muscles and everything like that in the brain
[02:49:23.200 --> 02:49:27.320]  and then we have also B12 which you're all super familiar with it promotes
[02:49:27.320 --> 02:49:30.960]  energy production and just helps work with these other ingredients to give you
[02:49:30.960 --> 02:49:35.880]  the synergistic formulation that is brain force and I have organic B12 yes
[02:49:35.880 --> 02:49:40.960]  we have the key like the difference is as we always talk about we're not going
[02:49:40.960 --> 02:49:43.720]  to go in and throw a synthetic junk we could have just put synthetic caffeine
[02:49:43.720 --> 02:49:46.120]  in here and it would have made you generate or would have made you crash
[02:49:46.120 --> 02:49:51.160]  but the difference is these work together it's not just an energy pill it's
[02:49:51.160 --> 02:49:53.960]  something that works synergistically with your brain to give you the not
[02:49:53.960 --> 02:49:57.840]  natural compounds you need to do what you want to do instead of firing you up
[02:49:57.840 --> 02:50:01.440]  going crazy and crashing down the earth this gives you I think like a
[02:50:01.440 --> 02:50:06.400]  sustainable warm type of drive oh when we run out of it I certainly noticed that
[02:50:06.400 --> 02:50:10.040]  I take one in the morning and one about this time after I eat instead of having
[02:50:10.040 --> 02:50:14.240]  my afternoon coffee yeah some days I still cheat and drink my afternoon coffee
[02:50:14.240 --> 02:50:18.560]  because I love coffee but it coffee doesn't work at night so I'm doing a
[02:50:18.560 --> 02:50:22.080]  coast-to-coast AM show I've been up since 6 a.m. and I'm exhausted but I'm
[02:50:22.080 --> 02:50:27.120]  excited to go on George's show I'll just pop a brain force at about 10 and then
[02:50:27.120 --> 02:50:31.360]  a couple hours when the show comes up I feel great until three when the show's
[02:50:31.360 --> 02:50:34.880]  over and I can go to bed but if I've drunk four cups of coffee then I can't
[02:50:34.880 --> 02:50:38.480]  go to bed at three in the morning it's like it makes me awake but I filter so
[02:50:38.480 --> 02:50:41.600]  it's just a game changer and it helps support the broadcast thank you all for
[02:50:41.600 --> 02:50:46.280]  purchasing it it is brain force try it out review it let us know what you think
[02:50:46.280 --> 02:50:51.720]  it's got a 4.8 review as well and it's at infowarslife.com hit your brain force

[02:54:37.000 --> 02:54:40.940]  gonna get to some of you right now let's talk to Brian in Arizona thanks for
[02:54:40.940 --> 02:54:49.240]  calling go ahead yes sir yeah I just want to call I live in a small town out
[02:54:49.240 --> 02:54:55.400]  here in Arizona and I'm seeing probably two to four drones a week flying over
[02:54:55.400 --> 02:54:59.400]  the valley and I know the drones I've zoomed in with my binoculars and I've
[02:54:59.400 --> 02:55:03.480]  also been seeing a patch he's flying around in formation about 18 to 20 of
[02:55:03.480 --> 02:55:08.440]  them and I just want to know what you know about that well sure thank god
[02:55:08.440 --> 02:55:14.480]  they're actually found to put troops on the border the military basically
[02:55:14.480 --> 02:55:18.880]  outside of Obama's orders even though he's purged the military is doing some
[02:55:18.880 --> 02:55:23.120]  reconnaissance of the border that's the only place you should have military
[02:55:23.120 --> 02:55:27.600]  operations is the border it's only places constitutional and basically they
[02:55:27.600 --> 02:55:31.560]  know there are ISIS operatives pouring across the border the FBI has confirmed
[02:55:31.560 --> 02:55:36.040]  that just like they're pouring into Europe and so we have multiple
[02:55:36.040 --> 02:55:39.160]  governments within governments we have good government we have bad government
[02:55:39.160 --> 02:55:43.040]  the problem is the bigger the government gets the more corrupted becomes
[02:55:43.040 --> 02:55:46.480]  historically but I don't know the specifics of what you're seeing but I
[02:55:46.480 --> 02:55:49.920]  know we're getting the same reports from our sources that there is increased
[02:55:49.920 --> 02:55:59.560]  military activity on the Texas Arizona California you name it border yeah I
[02:55:59.560 --> 02:56:03.840]  don't know I just see him circling straight around the town all day long I
[02:56:03.840 --> 02:56:08.000]  don't know what they're looking for and the other question was do we know any
[02:56:08.000 --> 02:56:12.680]  more about chemtrails because I'm seeing them on a daily basis like a
[02:56:12.680 --> 02:56:16.200]  tic-tac-toe pattern sure it's called geoengineering there's a giant secret
[02:56:16.200 --> 02:56:20.360]  program it's added to the jet fuel even the airlines except the top art part of
[02:56:20.360 --> 02:56:24.280]  it is compartmentalized and it's to change the atmosphere of the planet look
[02:56:24.280 --> 02:56:29.800]  up geoengineering and then it's all public under the word chemtrail there's
[02:56:29.800 --> 02:56:33.160]  nothing it's kind of like under FEMA camp there's no FEMA camps but under
[02:56:33.160 --> 02:56:37.880]  emergency centers establishment act or under resettlement operations or in
[02:56:37.880 --> 02:56:41.080]  tournament camp you'll be at the army website reading about how their main
[02:56:41.080 --> 02:56:44.640]  enemy's patriots and it's just people go there they just can't believe they're an
[02:56:44.640 --> 02:56:48.320]  army dot mill reading the most treasonous whacked out stuff you can
[02:56:48.320 --> 02:56:52.680]  imagine that doesn't mean the military is bad they're freaked out but they are
[02:56:52.680 --> 02:56:56.640]  training literally to kill their grandfathers I've been to the drills
[02:56:56.640 --> 02:57:00.800]  you've heard the military call in at every drill they got people that are
[02:57:00.800 --> 02:57:04.280]  good old boys black white Hispanic wearing John Deere hats going I love
[02:57:04.280 --> 02:57:09.160]  America I don't turn my guns in and they mow you down until last year then it
[02:57:09.160 --> 02:57:13.080]  started shifting to black people where we got footage from the drills and it
[02:57:13.080 --> 02:57:16.920]  was just all black people being rounded up and then we said oh they're getting
[02:57:16.920 --> 02:57:20.520]  ready to start a race war with the White House setting the black people up for
[02:57:20.520 --> 02:57:26.240]  the fall I mean it's just sick you can even Google the video I shot emergency
[02:57:26.240 --> 02:57:31.000]  alert Pentagon training to intern black people and then you notice all hell

[03:01:34.840 --> 03:01:40.560]  me I can hear you go ahead yeah I actually want to talk about a few things
[03:01:40.560 --> 03:01:48.160]  but uh I was put on riddling in third grade and from the moment I was put on
[03:01:48.160 --> 03:01:53.880]  it I was diagnosed with ADD because you didn't like to sit still for eight
[03:01:53.880 --> 03:01:58.600]  hours a day in a classroom right that was your problem I was busy and I like
[03:01:58.600 --> 03:02:02.400]  to play with boys and I like to build things and you were a kid yeah that made
[03:02:02.400 --> 03:02:09.360]  me yeah pretty much but from the moment I was put on riddling it basically made
[03:02:09.360 --> 03:02:16.360]  me feel pretty much suicidal all the time I remember getting in arguments with
[03:02:16.360 --> 03:02:22.240]  my parents you know as kids would do yeah in telling them you know my my
[03:02:22.240 --> 03:02:29.560]  default the solution was why I'm just gonna go kill myself you know and it
[03:02:29.560 --> 03:02:36.040]  wasn't so about 10th grade that I actually started refusing to take it so
[03:02:36.040 --> 03:02:41.640]  you wind yourself off of it without yeah pretty much yeah and how did you feel
[03:02:41.640 --> 03:02:48.880]  after you wind yourself off of it oh great in actually my sister's my nephew
[03:02:48.880 --> 03:02:55.240]  her son was diagnosed with ADD a couple years ago and I begged her I told her do
[03:02:55.240 --> 03:03:01.360]  not put him on riddling it will ruin your child's life don't do it in so far
[03:03:01.360 --> 03:03:07.480]  she hasn't done it in he's one of the most respectful obedient kids he plays
[03:03:07.480 --> 03:03:13.520]  football he's he's great at football and I mean he's probably one of the best
[03:03:13.520 --> 03:03:16.960]  behaved kids I've ever known yeah you know when kids have an outlet for their
[03:03:16.960 --> 03:03:20.400]  energy which an outlet for their energy is not sitting in school for eight hours
[03:03:20.400 --> 03:03:22.960]  a day but when they're able to go out and play sports are they're given
[03:03:22.960 --> 03:03:26.800]  constructive things to do stuff to concentrate on they're able to figure
[03:03:26.800 --> 03:03:30.760]  out how to use their mental abilities to their to their benefit but when you're
[03:03:30.760 --> 03:03:33.640]  putting them on these drugs they're turning them into zombies and make it in
[03:03:33.640 --> 03:03:37.880]  they're sitting and watching TV or playing video games for hours there's
[03:03:37.880 --> 03:03:41.920]  just no comparison of the two and also I think diet is also a big thing in these
[03:03:41.920 --> 03:03:45.520]  kids being hyperactive you give a kids a lot of sugar a lot of processed food a
[03:03:45.520 --> 03:03:48.840]  lot of dyes and they're gonna act out and then people are gonna say well they
[03:03:48.840 --> 03:03:52.760]  have ADD we got to do something about it here's a drug but you can still keep
[03:03:52.760 --> 03:03:56.240]  feeding them that crap that's okay so that's another thing you should also
[03:03:56.240 --> 03:04:00.880]  tell your your sister you know look at his diet what it what is she feeding him
[03:04:00.880 --> 03:04:05.640]  that's another way to help that out Matt do you have anything else yeah I
[03:04:05.640 --> 03:04:10.480]  actually I mean my sister used to see him McDonald's all the time and now

[03:04:58.200 --> 03:05:04.320]  let's talk about the real war on women first wave feminism was a noble cause
[03:05:04.320 --> 03:05:09.640]  but modern feminists well instead of fighting for say paid and protected
[03:05:09.640 --> 03:05:15.800]  maternity leave they want to ban words shirts and man-spreading come on
[03:05:15.800 --> 03:05:20.480]  that's cultural Marxism which asserts that culture and language is
[03:05:20.480 --> 03:05:25.200]  responsible for oppressing women and not the state the truth is the state
[03:05:25.200 --> 03:05:29.920]  encourages gender wars it's a divide and conquer tactic designed to keep us
[03:05:29.920 --> 03:05:34.280]  fighting amongst ourselves in fact the feminist movement was hijacked by the
[03:05:34.280 --> 03:05:39.640]  political class to exploit women as the late Aaron Russo revealed the Rockefellers
[03:05:39.640 --> 03:05:44.240]  bankrolled feminism and not because they had any interest in women's rights but
[03:05:44.240 --> 03:05:48.680]  because women in the workforce was the ultimate trifecta the state collects
[03:05:48.680 --> 03:05:52.520]  more tax dollars children are indoctrinated at an earlier age and

[03:08:40.080 --> 03:08:43.600]  watch the free live stream tell it all your friends and family about it it's
[03:08:43.600 --> 03:08:48.360]  free you can watch it right there on your computer and there's I'd say there's
[03:08:48.360 --> 03:08:52.200]  from live to that it's about a four-second delay so you're only getting
[03:08:52.200 --> 03:08:56.480]  it's really four seconds and that's about it which is I think is really
[03:08:56.480 --> 03:09:01.440]  amazing Ben you want to talk about big pharma and mass shootings what's on your
[03:09:01.440 --> 03:09:07.400]  mind yeah well first of all thanks for taking my call I'm really enjoying the
[03:09:07.400 --> 03:09:14.640]  fourth hour I am too great yeah anyway first of all I wanted to say it on the
[03:09:14.640 --> 03:09:20.160]  abortion issue that info wars life should probably consider maybe coming out
[03:09:20.160 --> 03:09:24.040]  with like a prenatal supplement or something like that because it's hard
[03:09:24.040 --> 03:09:29.600]  to be able to decipher which ones you can trust which ones you can't trust that's
[03:09:29.600 --> 03:09:34.960]  a very good idea my wife's actually pregnant with our fourth child and she
[03:09:34.960 --> 03:09:39.280]  takes some really good prenatal vitamins she did her research but I totally
[03:09:39.280 --> 03:09:44.200]  agree with you that's a great suggestion go on continue yeah I mean well my my
[03:09:44.200 --> 03:09:48.400]  wife's a nurse and we're talking about having another kid but she you know
[03:09:48.400 --> 03:09:52.640]  where we have to plan around her having to get this flu shot or else you know
[03:09:52.640 --> 03:09:57.600]  being ostracized from the nursing community so it's really tough to try and
[03:09:57.600 --> 03:10:02.120]  weigh the benefits and the risks but it's coming up on the one-year anniversary
[03:10:02.120 --> 03:10:08.640]  the 22nd of a friend of one of mine you can look it up she pushed her daughter
[03:10:08.640 --> 03:10:13.560]  out of the way of getting run over by a car in front of a Walgreens and you know
[03:10:13.560 --> 03:10:17.800]  we started a or contributed to a go fund me page and everything else and raised
[03:10:17.800 --> 03:10:23.920]  a bunch of money for a family but recently you know we were looking to get
[03:10:23.920 --> 03:10:29.080]  charges filed against this woman who you know basically ran her over and killed
[03:10:29.080 --> 03:10:33.960]  in front of Walgreens well turns out of course that she was on all kinds of
[03:10:33.960 --> 03:10:38.120]  pharmaceuticals but because they were prescription no charges were going to be
[03:10:38.120 --> 03:10:44.560]  filed and you know big pharma they kill in you know a peripheral fashion as well
[03:10:44.560 --> 03:10:50.360]  it's not just the mass shooters that you know take people out it's the ruined
[03:10:50.360 --> 03:10:54.400]  families with the abuse of parents or you know children that are put on the
[03:10:54.400 --> 03:11:00.160]  ADHD medication like the last guy I mean according to that 92 New Zealand survey
[03:11:00.160 --> 03:11:04.360]  and then the follow-up studies it's the vaccinations that caused ADHD in the
[03:11:04.360 --> 03:11:07.680]  first place or you know that's what they led that what that's what the
[03:11:07.680 --> 03:11:11.560]  eventual conclusion was that and I mean yeah there's lots of us studies that
[03:11:11.560 --> 03:11:15.040]  they've done in Europe looking at kids who are unvaccinated versus vaccinated
[03:11:15.040 --> 03:11:19.280]  and I did a bunch of reports on this last year just going over the numbers that
[03:11:19.280 --> 03:11:22.360]  they were seeing and they were just polling families and saying does your
[03:11:22.360 --> 03:11:25.560]  kid have allergies is your kid have ADHD where they vaccinated and the ones that
[03:11:25.560 --> 03:11:29.600]  weren't vaccinated it was drastically lower the amount of side effects that
[03:11:29.600 --> 03:11:34.480]  these kids had because it's not just death or incef encephalopathy
[03:11:34.480 --> 03:11:37.680]  whatever it's called when you when you have encephalitis and you're having
[03:11:37.680 --> 03:11:43.440]  seizures of the brain or febrile seizures it's not those things those are
[03:11:43.440 --> 03:11:46.920]  really bad side effects or autism those are really bad ones there's a ton of
[03:11:46.920 --> 03:11:50.880]  other side effects that could be happening and your kid probably has them
[03:11:50.880 --> 03:11:56.700]  is your kid have allergies as your kid especially to certain foods peanut
[03:11:56.700 --> 03:12:02.880]  allergies is specifically linked to certain vaccinations so go ahead yeah
[03:12:02.880 --> 03:12:06.040]  I mean then so that's basically it we're coming up on the one-year anniversary
[03:12:06.040 --> 03:12:11.000]  of her death it's a really sad thing you know we dedicated our softball team
[03:12:11.000 --> 03:12:15.680]  tour and everything else because she was just she was a great person and driving
[03:12:15.680 --> 03:12:20.640]  the car over they on what were they they don't they didn't release the
[03:12:20.640 --> 03:12:25.880]  specifics I don't know that but I do know that that was the that was the case
[03:12:25.880 --> 03:12:30.760]  but nothing specific no specific drug type or anything like that but it was a
[03:12:30.760 --> 03:12:36.160]  you know it's a tragedy this family is you know it's ruined forever yeah you know I
[03:12:36.160 --> 03:12:39.640]  mean big farm is not just about the mass shooters and everything else it's about
[03:12:39.640 --> 03:12:44.560]  you know the families who are affected you know by these little conditions that
[03:12:44.560 --> 03:12:48.280]  people have to suffer through their entire lives I mean ADHD has been a
[03:12:48.280 --> 03:12:54.000]  struggle for me personally I'm lucky now to have a job that you know where I like
[03:12:54.000 --> 03:12:59.880]  the last guy say I build stuff I build machines that measure radiation from a
[03:12:59.880 --> 03:13:04.480]  linear accelerator for cancer treatment you know I I didn't make it through
[03:13:04.480 --> 03:13:08.520]  college because my ADHD just had a hold of me but here I am doing this high
[03:13:08.520 --> 03:13:13.720]  level of work and it's because you know we have this opportunity you know with
[03:13:13.720 --> 03:13:18.600]  these manufacturing and you know assembly type jobs that's perfect for ADHD
[03:13:18.600 --> 03:13:23.160]  and then you know all of those are going overseas to China though so right it's a
[03:13:23.160 --> 03:13:28.080]  pretty grim picture but overall I think that you can always get a job with big
[03:13:28.080 --> 03:13:31.960]  farmers selling this crap to kids and pushing it on other people I mean it's
[03:13:31.960 --> 03:13:36.880]  they seem to be set up to make profits at the expense of our health and now now
[03:13:36.880 --> 03:13:40.120]  that we have Obamacare you're gonna see more people getting prescribed this
[03:13:40.120 --> 03:13:44.800]  stuff on on a mass scale and that's what they want they they put out the
[03:13:44.800 --> 03:13:49.200]  metrics they want over half of us medicated by the year 2020 on some
[03:13:49.200 --> 03:13:52.760]  sort of drug because that's the problem they think the human is not perfect
[03:13:52.760 --> 03:13:56.920]  enough they need to help us and augment us thanks for the call Ben Roger you're
[03:13:56.920 --> 03:14:00.320]  gonna be my last call for a little bit but Joshua Bodie and Eric you guys hang
[03:14:00.320 --> 03:14:03.000]  on I may be able to get to you by the end of the show if you want to hang on
[03:14:03.000 --> 03:14:08.760]  but Roger in California go ahead yeah I had an idea a few to massively reach a
[03:14:08.760 --> 03:14:13.240]  lot more people every every day people send out emails rich everyone listening
[03:14:13.240 --> 03:14:17.120]  has got one or multiple email accounts when you create a new email it says
[03:14:17.120 --> 03:14:21.200]  something like sincerely Rob do what happens if you change the settings in
[03:14:21.200 --> 03:14:27.200]  your email so it's a sincerely Rob do a visit info wars.com if you like the site

[03:14:38.560 --> 03:14:42.720]  signature line yeah you know just think about this this this could be a massive
[03:14:42.720 --> 03:14:46.560]  viral way to do this because everyone listening rich everyone's got at least
[03:14:46.560 --> 03:14:50.840]  one email account maybe several right and they could be reaching all kinds of
[03:14:50.840 --> 03:14:54.520]  people every time they send an email there's a link back to info wars right
[03:14:54.520 --> 03:14:58.440]  that's in your auto signature you can set that up on just about every email
[03:14:58.440 --> 03:15:01.200]  system that I know of and one thing if you guys want to pull up the computer
[03:15:01.200 --> 03:15:04.800]  that I haven't here get informed now you can sign up for the info wars insider
[03:15:04.800 --> 03:15:10.560]  we send out a email list every day even on on the weekends you get a couple of

[03:15:14.080 --> 03:15:18.040]  articles and other things that were that were really pushing that day certain
[03:15:18.040 --> 03:15:22.960]  yesterday I think today we're gonna be putting the video in of the sheriff who's
[03:15:22.960 --> 03:15:27.200]  running for always running for sheriff in Harris County over near Houston who's
[03:15:27.200 --> 03:15:31.240]  got a real strong constitutional mind and really tells it like it is and he
[03:15:31.240 --> 03:15:35.960]  broke down yesterday how Obama the the secret behind his purging of the
[03:15:35.960 --> 03:15:41.320]  military officers and this because those guys did not those guys did not take
[03:15:41.320 --> 03:15:44.760]  the oaths to protect and serve the president they take an oath to the
[03:15:44.760 --> 03:15:49.440]  Constitution and that is where he doesn't like it so anyway continue on
[03:15:49.440 --> 03:15:54.120]  Roger what else you have the point is that every time you send on email there
[03:15:54.120 --> 03:15:58.920]  could be a link back to info wars or info or show or whatever and you know you
[03:15:58.920 --> 03:16:02.280]  could also do this for example if you post on the internet I mean virtually
[03:16:02.280 --> 03:16:05.560]  everyone's posting and they've got some kind of a signature line even on
[03:16:05.560 --> 03:16:09.600]  Facebook on the social media every time you post on the internet every time you
[03:16:09.600 --> 03:16:14.320]  send an email it could say like sincerely Rob do you know visit info wars
[03:16:14.320 --> 03:16:17.480]  dot com and all they have to do is click the link people are going to click it
[03:16:17.480 --> 03:16:22.000]  out of curiosity and the thing is so you can have someone in a course of just
[03:16:22.000 --> 03:16:26.680]  doing it their normal days work they could be sending out 1020 links to the
[03:16:26.680 --> 03:16:30.320]  show and when people are just it's a normal email that people are naturally
[03:16:30.320 --> 03:16:34.880]  reading you know from a friend to a friend or to you know family members or
[03:16:34.880 --> 03:16:38.640]  you know something like that you know business associates they're gonna click

[03:16:42.160 --> 03:16:46.680]  and just click the link boom they're there and this could really go massively
[03:16:46.680 --> 03:16:51.000]  viral because I know you need to reach more people and but this is simple way
[03:16:51.000 --> 03:16:54.520]  people automatically doing it people automatically gonna reach more people
[03:16:54.520 --> 03:16:58.480]  and people trust what they hear from their friends more than they trust
[03:16:58.480 --> 03:17:01.840]  especially what they see from the mainstream media out there because you
[03:17:01.840 --> 03:17:03.920]  know I think a lot of people have gotten the hint that the mainstream media
[03:17:03.920 --> 03:17:07.680]  doesn't have their best interest in heart thank you for that call Roger that's a
[03:17:07.680 --> 03:17:12.760]  great suggestion and people should do that so open up your auto signature put

[03:17:31.800 --> 03:17:36.400]  headline panic as two children die seven in critical condition after measles
[03:17:36.400 --> 03:17:41.560]  vaccine and this is seven children in Cario Valley Hospital hospitalized
[03:17:41.560 --> 03:17:45.880]  hundreds of others recalled the medical centers for observation two children
[03:17:45.880 --> 03:17:48.440]  died on Tuesday and seven were hospitalized in serious condition after
[03:17:48.440 --> 03:17:53.320]  receiving the measles vaccine in the Cario Valley seven were said to be
[03:17:53.320 --> 03:17:57.640]  critical condition and falling ill soon after the botched jabs both the dead
[03:17:57.640 --> 03:18:01.120]  children were nine months years old the mother of one of the children was also
[03:18:01.120 --> 03:18:04.720]  said to have developed swelling on her lips after coming into contact with the
[03:18:04.720 --> 03:18:10.800]  vomit from her dying baby this is just horrible to read this and so I saw this
[03:18:10.800 --> 03:18:14.880]  I put it out on Twitter last night and then and I said I wonder who they're
[03:18:14.880 --> 03:18:17.400]  going to blame they're not going to blame the vaccine and then I did some
[03:18:17.400 --> 03:18:20.880]  searching and oh look children who died after in fact measles vaccine were
[03:18:20.880 --> 03:18:26.120]  injected by a cleaner they're they're blaming it on the cleaning person now
[03:18:26.120 --> 03:18:30.440]  they're they're gonna get thrown under the bus two children died after we're
[03:18:30.440 --> 03:18:33.440]  injected by a cleaner the government said on Wednesday director of medical
[03:18:33.440 --> 03:18:36.880]  services said the housekeeper the ones from cleaner has worked at the health
[03:18:36.880 --> 03:18:40.800]  center for more than eight years and it seems he has treated patients before the
[03:18:40.800 --> 03:18:44.640]  man has been arrested other than the domestic fridge not providing the
[03:18:44.640 --> 03:18:47.640]  correct temperatures there's possibility the cleaner used the wrong chemical to
[03:18:47.640 --> 03:18:52.400]  mix the vaccine which comes in a powder form so it's not like the the form the
[03:18:52.400 --> 03:18:56.000]  the same format that you see here in the United States where they're injecting a
[03:18:56.000 --> 03:19:00.720]  vial they're actually mixing it and there is a possibility that that happened
[03:19:00.720 --> 03:19:06.080]  maybe they got too much but it wasn't anything else other than the vaccine
[03:19:06.080 --> 03:19:09.440]  that was causing these children to die it so it seems especially from this
[03:19:09.440 --> 03:19:13.640]  article but now pathologists launch investigation into Kerrio Valley measles
[03:19:13.640 --> 03:19:18.280]  death a team of government pathologists from Nairobi were on Wednesday sent to
[03:19:18.280 --> 03:19:21.680]  the Kerrio Valley to carry out investigations into Tuesday's mysterious
[03:19:21.680 --> 03:19:26.480]  death of two minors after a botched measles vaccination and this is the
[03:19:26.480 --> 03:19:31.520]  mother of this here's a picture of the mother of one of the kids who died really
[03:19:31.520 --> 03:19:36.360]  horrible stuff and I'm and it gets even worse after this and of course the
[03:19:36.360 --> 03:19:39.440]  church in that area is speaking out against vaccinations and of course
[03:19:39.440 --> 03:19:42.920]  they're coming under fire from the local governments because the plan is to
[03:19:42.920 --> 03:19:48.000]  vaccinate the third world population vigorously and what Bill Gates says he
[03:19:48.000 --> 03:19:51.640]  hopes to reduce population by 10% so he just admits it right there at a TED

[03:24:54.880 --> 03:24:59.800]  with this vaccination news now the reason the church is speaking out against
[03:24:59.800 --> 03:25:05.480]  these vaccines goes back to earlier in the summer here's a here's an article
[03:25:05.480 --> 03:25:09.640]  actually earlier than that here's an article from February 8th 2015 polio
[03:25:09.640 --> 03:25:14.960]  let's see polio vaccination begins despite protests from Catholic Church
[03:25:14.960 --> 03:25:19.520]  and nearly 6 million children in 32 counties will be vaccinated against
[03:25:19.520 --> 03:25:23.400]  polio despite the Catholic Church asking parents to boycott the exercise over
[03:25:23.400 --> 03:25:28.320]  safe over concerns the safety of the vaccine controversy is similar to one
[03:25:28.320 --> 03:25:30.920]  that happened last year in the Catholic Church raised a storm over a tetanus
[03:25:30.920 --> 03:25:38.200]  vaccination which they claim causality in women Dr. Karnja said the polio
[03:25:38.200 --> 03:25:42.280]  vaccine which is not like the old ones used for routine vaccination exercise
[03:25:42.280 --> 03:25:46.080]  and available in any hospital is laced with an active ingredient a hormone that
[03:25:46.080 --> 03:25:50.080]  if injected into children will affect their growth and reproductive abilities
[03:25:50.080 --> 03:25:54.000]  he says it is not like the ones used for routine but it is late so they're
[03:25:54.000 --> 03:25:58.520]  claiming it's got some kind of well population control mechanism built into
[03:25:58.520 --> 03:26:02.280]  it which is what Bill Gates has said you can go to any of our videos and look
[03:26:02.280 --> 03:26:06.320]  about look up Bill Gates in vaccination I think we even questioned him about it
[03:26:06.320 --> 03:26:11.640]  when he came here in Austin a few years ago but hey a lab tested it and declared
[03:26:11.640 --> 03:26:15.320]  the polio vaccine safe so you can see that was all these are all from the
[03:26:15.320 --> 03:26:19.960]  daily nation this is an African website and the polio vaccine currently being
[03:26:19.960 --> 03:26:24.000]  administered to children under the age of five is safe the national quality
[03:26:24.000 --> 03:26:28.280]  control laboratory has said but why were people why was the church speaking out
[03:26:28.280 --> 03:26:33.480]  against it why are people mad well here we go this is in July 28th checkups
[03:26:33.480 --> 03:26:39.960]  begin after BUSA children paralyzed after jabs oh look at that polio vaccine
[03:26:39.960 --> 03:26:44.720]  causes polio who to thunk it 30 children who were paralyzed after being
[03:26:44.720 --> 03:26:50.080]  injected at a dispensary and BUSIA have begun checkups the affected children
[03:26:50.080 --> 03:26:53.600]  be developed weak limbs after being injected most of the children can barely
[03:26:53.600 --> 03:26:57.320]  walk while others have septic wounds older children use walking sticks to move
[03:26:57.320 --> 03:27:01.440]  around in some cases parents claim the children's feet started rotting away so
[03:27:01.440 --> 03:27:06.960]  that's why the Catholic Church was up in arms about this but let's go back you
[03:27:06.960 --> 03:27:12.360]  go back to this this is what happens if you don't get your kids vaccinated Dr.
[03:27:12.360 --> 03:27:15.920]  Ego criticized religious leaders opposed to the campaign saying they're being
[03:27:15.920 --> 03:27:19.200]  insincere and were misleading to the public he warned parents of dire
[03:27:19.200 --> 03:27:22.680]  consequences if they failed to take their children for vaccination we will
[03:27:22.680 --> 03:27:27.080]  arrest and prosecute all the parents who will deny their children the vaccine he
[03:27:27.080 --> 03:27:32.080]  said so and he said he said religious leaders don't have the right to
[03:27:32.080 --> 03:27:36.280]  mislead the public and all they're doing is going hey look these kids were
[03:27:36.280 --> 03:27:40.160]  paralyzed we want an investigation and they're going shut up and take the
[03:27:40.160 --> 03:27:45.160]  vaccine to shut up again line Bill Gates once these vaccines sent all the
[03:27:45.160 --> 03:27:50.360]  kids and ejected because he needs a 10% reduction in population in fact if you
[03:27:50.360 --> 03:27:54.680]  guys can find it it's a TED talk where he says that if you can find that and
[03:27:54.680 --> 03:27:59.760]  now it's not just Africa it's not just last week when we covered what we thought
[03:27:59.760 --> 03:28:03.360]  it was Mexico but it was Colombia where the girls were flailing about for getting
[03:28:03.360 --> 03:28:08.680]  their HPV vaccine here it is in Vietnam 7th infant death after Vietnam brings
[03:28:08.680 --> 03:28:13.600]  back controversial vaccine when a vaccine a three month old boy died in the
[03:28:13.600 --> 03:28:16.800]  Central Highlands on Thursday soon after he was given when vaccine the
[03:28:16.800 --> 03:28:20.280]  controversial five-in-one vaccine that Vietnam suspended for five months in
[03:28:20.280 --> 03:28:25.640]  2013 following several infant deaths he became very weak and turned pale a few
[03:28:25.640 --> 03:28:30.080]  hours later he died soon after they brought him to a local hospital local
[03:28:30.080 --> 03:28:33.040]  health officials said around 20 other babies received the shots and they were
[03:28:33.040 --> 03:28:39.560]  fine so you know only a one in 20 cause of death there looks like it is the
[03:28:39.560 --> 03:28:43.680]  WHO pre-qualified the drug and said is much cheaper than alternatives it's
[03:28:43.680 --> 03:28:48.520]  right it's the job done health ministry suspended the vaccine on May 4th 2013
[03:28:48.520 --> 03:28:53.880]  after nine infants died between November 12th or November 2012 and March 2013
[03:28:53.880 --> 03:28:58.200]  six infant deaths since quenvaxin was brought back have not been linked to the
[03:28:58.200 --> 03:29:02.960]  vaccine either so nothing to worry about it's not the vaccine we can't ever talk
[03:29:02.960 --> 03:29:07.880]  about our precious vaccines because then we might have to admit that there's
[03:29:07.880 --> 03:29:11.240]  something wrong with them and then we might have to do real investigations and
[03:29:11.240 --> 03:29:15.200]  actually call for real studies of these things and then look at all the side
[03:29:15.200 --> 03:29:20.600]  effects and look at what parents were really saying after their kids get the
[03:29:20.600 --> 03:29:24.360]  shots because when we were taking calls a few weeks ago about that there's the
[03:29:24.360 --> 03:29:29.840]  young girls in in carmondale boulevard in columbia all having seizures after
[03:29:29.840 --> 03:29:32.960]  they received the guard at the loving Gardasil shot after the break we're

[03:30:15.760 --> 03:30:20.240]  republicans and then when the republicans showed their true colors you
[03:30:20.240 --> 03:30:25.360]  got angry and elected democrats and when anyone suggested to you that both
[03:30:25.360 --> 03:30:29.680]  parties were corrupt and that neither side were looking out for your best
[03:30:29.680 --> 03:30:35.920]  interest you acted like they were crazy but the real definition of crazy is
[03:30:35.920 --> 03:30:41.400]  doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results

[03:36:00.800 --> 03:36:05.360]  your area it could be a power plant blows up it could be maybe a nuclear
[03:36:05.360 --> 03:36:08.400]  incident one of these power plants you know it could be the EPA releasing
[03:36:08.400 --> 03:36:11.720]  chemicals under the water supply like they did out west yeah you know there's
[03:36:11.720 --> 03:36:14.600]  a lot of farmers that weren't able to water their crops they were afraid to
[03:36:14.600 --> 03:36:19.640]  drink it and and it was created by the government created by the government and
[03:36:19.640 --> 03:36:23.960]  and it was actually predicted by a guy who lives in Farmington he actually
[03:36:23.960 --> 03:36:27.080]  wrote an op-ed I tried tracking him down but I think he's still on vacation he
[03:36:27.080 --> 03:36:30.560]  wrote this op-ed he was so pissed off that he goes what the EPA is going to do
[03:36:30.560 --> 03:36:34.240]  is cause a disaster and then they're gonna go here is our solution it's to
[03:36:34.240 --> 03:36:37.960]  build a giant you know cleanup center worth multi-millions of dollars well he
[03:36:37.960 --> 03:36:41.960]  wasn't just theorizing he'd been an engineer for 40 some odd years yeah he
[03:36:41.960 --> 03:36:46.720]  said what they're doing is guaranteed to cause an explosion and a release of
[03:36:46.720 --> 03:36:48.840]  these materials yeah and then I'll tell you what they're gonna do they're gonna
[03:36:48.840 --> 03:36:54.160]  use this as an excuse to expand their own power yeah exactly exactly that's what
[03:36:54.160 --> 03:36:58.360]  they did so tell me a little bit about your vacation you just got back very
[03:36:58.360 --> 03:37:01.520]  well deserved you you took over for Alex while he was gone you're covering
[03:37:01.520 --> 03:37:05.560]  all those days plus we had the nightly news and well we just took a an
[03:37:05.560 --> 03:37:09.080]  opportunity to relax yeah the Pacific Northwest I'd never really seen it in
[03:37:09.080 --> 03:37:12.600]  much detail it's a nice cool up there oh it was night that was a prerequisite we
[03:37:12.600 --> 03:37:16.560]  had to go somewhere it was cool we wanted to see the Redwood forests and my
[03:37:16.560 --> 03:37:20.640]  sons and and daughter had never seen that before so we went into Portland
[03:37:20.640 --> 03:37:24.920]  looked around Oregon it was very beautiful I looked at the waterfalls the
[03:37:24.920 --> 03:37:28.560]  Columbia River Gorge and we went down saw the Redwood Forest went up to the
[03:37:28.560 --> 03:37:33.080]  Olympia Peninsula saw the rainforest up there saw Mount St. Helens so we did a
[03:37:33.080 --> 03:37:36.240]  lot of driving it was a very nice Mount St. Helens looks interesting it looks
[03:37:36.240 --> 03:37:40.120]  like somebody took a big bite out of that mountain yeah yeah and right there
[03:37:40.120 --> 03:37:45.840]  where they Johnston was one of the guys from the US Geological Service that was
[03:37:45.840 --> 03:37:48.840]  killed that day that exploded to see the one taking the photographs and saying
[03:37:48.840 --> 03:37:52.160]  this is it yeah he they've been warning people but they were completely
[03:37:52.160 --> 03:37:55.880]  surprised by the magnitude right it was way way bigger than anything that it
[03:37:55.880 --> 03:38:01.800]  expected so he was there observing and of course the blast zone went many many
[03:38:01.800 --> 03:38:04.800]  miles I forget how many miles it was but it's absolutely incredible because
[03:38:04.800 --> 03:38:08.320]  they have markers where the blast zone went to and the outer edge of the blast
[03:38:08.320 --> 03:38:12.600]  zone they now have trees that are 30 35 years old but still around Mount St.
[03:38:12.600 --> 03:38:16.320]  Helens nothing has grown back wow so and you can see where they built this
[03:38:16.320 --> 03:38:20.000]  monument there you can see where the mountain blew out and came towards him
[03:38:20.000 --> 03:38:23.640]  it was eight miles away it reached him within 40 seconds that's how fast it was
[03:38:23.640 --> 03:38:27.640]  traveling and that is not the only active volcano in that area no I think
[03:38:27.640 --> 03:38:30.720]  there's like 13 there's a few that are dormant but in that area that's it's
[03:38:30.720 --> 03:38:34.280]  very active and it has to do with the tectonic plates out in the Pacific and
[03:38:34.280 --> 03:38:38.080]  it was miniscule compared to the caldera that's at Yellowstone right
[03:38:38.080 --> 03:38:42.600]  absolutely many many organ orders of magnitude smaller than than what
[03:38:42.600 --> 03:38:47.080]  Yellowstone is so there you go and so now you had a great vacation you're back
[03:38:47.080 --> 03:38:52.840]  at the airport about to fly back and of course the TSA had to jump in and well
[03:38:52.840 --> 03:38:57.680]  you know we always opt out as a family I always opt out I've had situations we
[03:38:57.680 --> 03:39:02.200]  had the opt out and film I filmed myself I was traveling by myself so I didn't
[03:39:02.200 --> 03:39:06.600]  have anybody to film me so you can see this but you really need to hear what
[03:39:06.600 --> 03:39:11.720]  what went on between us to get put this in context wait we'll play that in just
[03:39:11.720 --> 03:39:16.160]  a second but in context we went up and and traveling with my daughter they
[03:39:16.160 --> 03:39:19.720]  let my wife and daughter go through the scanner instead of having to pack down
[03:39:19.720 --> 03:39:22.840]  and so we were talking to the fellow there about the adoption and that's
[03:39:22.840 --> 03:39:25.840]  where I think he'd adopted a child and so he said just all of you go through
[03:39:25.840 --> 03:39:30.560]  right except for Travis Travis was over to the side he'd already opted out so
[03:39:30.560 --> 03:39:34.240]  we had to wait a very long time for him and what was unusual about it was the
[03:39:34.240 --> 03:39:37.400]  guy who was a screener when we finally got there spent a very long time talking
[03:39:37.400 --> 03:39:41.560]  to Travis and so we started filming we don't always film yeah we started
[03:39:41.560 --> 03:39:46.280]  filming that got them very upset so the guy who let us through came up to me and
[03:39:46.280 --> 03:39:49.040]  started talking to me about filming and this is what he had to say all right
[03:39:49.040 --> 03:39:55.560]  let's roll it I think you guys are favored by what and you go through that
[03:39:55.560 --> 03:40:02.280]  now you're doing this I do this all the time yes we have to do it because he
[03:40:02.280 --> 03:40:06.480]  also I have to do this to protect my rights yeah but we're not offending him
[03:40:06.480 --> 03:40:10.980]  I find this whole process offensive yes I find it defensive in America be
[03:40:10.980 --> 03:40:14.640]  considered a terrorist and have to prove my innocence so I'm gonna keep doing this
[03:40:14.640 --> 03:40:18.320]  I have a right to do this if you look at the TSA it says I have a right to do
[03:40:18.320 --> 03:40:22.800]  if he agrees have his face up there because we've been slandered a lot when
[03:40:22.800 --> 03:40:25.920]  we don't have jobs and we've done you know what there's nothing about him
[03:40:25.920 --> 03:40:30.560]  agreeing to doing his job if police and TSA we're allowed to film it's our right
[03:40:30.560 --> 03:40:35.520]  to do that you are servants of the people you are not separate to the people
[03:40:35.520 --> 03:40:39.160]  we have a right to film you we will continue to film you there are cameras
[03:40:39.160 --> 03:40:43.520]  everywhere everybody's being yeah so we these are our camera these are the
[03:40:43.520 --> 03:40:47.960]  people cameras you got a problem with that okay I just told you I did your
[03:40:47.960 --> 03:40:53.120]  favor I understand you think you did us a favor I appreciate it thank you thank
[03:40:53.120 --> 03:40:57.320]  you so you see that long shot there my other son when he saw this developing
[03:40:57.320 --> 03:41:01.160]  started filming he went to the back his camera started filming me to see what
[03:41:01.160 --> 03:41:02.960]  was going on because he thought something was gonna develop there but
[03:41:02.960 --> 03:41:05.960]  that was the thing about it when I said hey you've got cameras all around here
[03:41:05.960 --> 03:41:11.240]  the guy got this look on those things like yeah yeah we got we got all these
[03:41:11.240 --> 03:41:14.800]  toys they let us play with we get to look through your bags yeah great you
[03:41:14.800 --> 03:41:18.720]  notice how insensitive he got about the fact that we were going to dare you
[03:41:18.720 --> 03:41:22.320]  possibly put pictures of them up on the internet and it's like why are you guys
[03:41:22.320 --> 03:41:28.040]  treating us like slaves yeah that's the security theater that's the result of
[03:41:28.040 --> 03:41:31.520]  9-11 what they brought in with 9-11 with the fake underwear bomber we're gonna
[03:41:31.520 --> 03:41:34.360]  talk about that on the nightly news tonight that's right but when you look
[03:41:34.360 --> 03:41:37.880]  at this security theater understand that what they're going to do at the
[03:41:37.880 --> 03:41:41.680]  border with the wall they've already that's security theater as well it's not
[03:41:41.680 --> 03:41:44.880]  going to close the border it's not going to help me think this is being
[03:41:44.880 --> 03:41:49.000]  incentivized the open immigration is being incentivized by Obama he has
[03:41:49.000 --> 03:41:52.760]  given them all kinds of goodies and when you make that kind of pot of gold
[03:41:52.760 --> 03:41:56.040]  available to them at the end of the rainbow they will do anything to come
[03:41:56.040 --> 03:42:00.240]  in and guess what about 40% of them come in on airplanes according to some
[03:42:00.240 --> 03:42:03.280]  statistics we don't know because we don't know how many people are coming in
[03:42:03.280 --> 03:42:06.240]  some people put that figure out you can't verify that because we don't know
[03:42:06.240 --> 03:42:11.320]  who's coming into the country but these efforts to try to stop this to try to set
[03:42:11.320 --> 03:42:15.400]  up a police state at the border are going to be just as ineffective just as
[03:42:15.400 --> 03:42:20.440]  obtrusive as this ridiculous TSA theater that we have to go through you know I
[03:42:20.440 --> 03:42:25.360]  met I went tubing over the weekend the long weekend and I met a guy who's
[03:42:25.360 --> 03:42:29.560]  Hispanic fellow and his girlfriend they were we're all inflating our tubes and
[03:42:29.560 --> 03:42:33.360]  we started talking about a little bit about politics he'd never heard info
[03:42:33.360 --> 03:42:36.840]  wars and he goes so what do you think about Trump I said well you know I like
[03:42:36.840 --> 03:42:39.840]  some things Trump says and they need to be said but I don't think you know
[03:42:39.840 --> 03:42:42.520]  building a wall is going to solve anything I think you know you build a
[03:42:42.520 --> 03:42:45.560]  10-foot wall you get a 11-foot ladder are you gonna total under it there's
[03:42:45.560 --> 03:42:48.760]  ways to get around that I think you have to get rid of the incentives for
[03:42:48.760 --> 03:42:52.280]  people to come here and he goes you know I heard it's not even it's not even
[03:42:52.280 --> 03:42:55.720]  mostly Mexicans is people from South America and people from China yes
[03:42:55.720 --> 03:43:00.080]  coming in yes and he's right you know and he doesn't even listen to us but the
[03:43:00.080 --> 03:43:04.440]  word is getting out there that it's not it's not about Mexican people it's about
[03:43:04.440 --> 03:43:08.360]  the whole world wanting to come here and we have to do this legal and lawfully
[03:43:08.360 --> 03:43:11.880]  because we're not allowed to go anywhere else and just show up you know John
[03:43:11.880 --> 03:43:15.480]  McAfee got deported from Guatemala when he went in there illegally and they said
[03:43:15.480 --> 03:43:18.400]  no you're getting out of our country you're out of here you came in through
[03:43:18.400 --> 03:43:21.040]  here illegally we don't like it so they booted him out of the country back to
[03:43:21.040 --> 03:43:26.400]  the US that's how it's supposed to work yeah you get caught you know there's
[03:43:26.400 --> 03:43:29.520]  now reports of people like five times being deported that are getting caught
[03:43:29.520 --> 03:43:34.440]  I mean it's getting ridiculous out there totally ridiculous so now Trump
[03:43:34.440 --> 03:43:38.480]  of course he tried to walk it back today yeah but he says we need to bring the
[03:43:38.480 --> 03:43:42.400]  refugees from Syria and because they're going through absolute help that's not
[03:43:42.400 --> 03:43:47.360]  the criteria and he didn't he never addressed what was the root cause of the
[03:43:47.360 --> 03:43:51.720]  Syrian war right Syrian refugees now about our support our creation our
[03:43:51.720 --> 03:43:56.960]  arming our equipping of ISIS how that began in Syria that was those those were
[03:43:56.960 --> 03:44:01.480]  the surrogates of John McCain and Barack Obama and of course he completely
[03:44:01.480 --> 03:44:04.880]  ignores that he says this wouldn't have happened if we'd gone in and attacked
[03:44:04.880 --> 03:44:09.200]  Syria and it's like we did go in and attack Syria we would have done it more
[03:44:09.200 --> 03:44:13.160]  except we exposed that they were using false flag incidents to try that the
[03:44:13.160 --> 03:44:17.440]  the saring gas supposedly right those released they tried to use things like
[03:44:17.440 --> 03:44:21.040]  that to up the war it would have been more refugees would have been more
[03:44:21.040 --> 03:44:25.000]  destruction well Obama wanted to go into Obama wanted to go in and we had the
[03:44:25.000 --> 03:44:28.120]  military stand down and so we're not going to be ISIS's air force yes not
[03:44:28.120 --> 03:44:32.120]  going to do it yes and so he's echoing the same things as Obama which I think
[03:44:32.120 --> 03:44:36.280]  is just totally just underscores the fact that we don't really have a choice
[03:44:36.280 --> 03:44:40.120]  right in this that all of these guys are rep they're not outsiders they're not
[03:44:40.120 --> 03:44:43.720]  talking about anything different Ben Carson Donald Trump they're not saying
[03:44:43.720 --> 03:44:47.440]  anything that the other guys haven't already said in terms of our foreign
[03:44:47.440 --> 03:44:51.320]  policy in terms of civil liberties have you heard any of them talk about this
[03:44:51.320 --> 03:44:54.680]  security theater have you heard any of them propose anything that would give us
[03:44:54.680 --> 03:44:58.880]  our constitutional rights back they asked these got your questions like it's a
[03:44:58.880 --> 03:45:03.480]  game show about the political parties of Israel that doesn't matter yeah if they
[03:45:03.480 --> 03:45:06.520]  don't know or care about the Constitution about our bill of rights ask
[03:45:06.520 --> 03:45:11.000]  them about that if they can recite yes one of the amendments in the bill of
[03:45:11.000 --> 03:45:15.120]  rights okay and the 7th amendment you know that yeah what do you think that
[03:45:15.120 --> 03:45:19.040]  means yeah exactly and that and that's the problem it is the presidential
[03:45:19.040 --> 03:45:22.800]  reality show as Gerald Salante said and others it really I know people are
[03:45:22.800 --> 03:45:25.560]  putting a lot of eggs behind Donald Trump and he's saying some things that
[03:45:25.560 --> 03:45:29.320]  need to be said it's great that that stuff's getting out there in the public
[03:45:29.320 --> 03:45:34.320]  arena but at the end of the day when you're getting that high up you know if
[03:45:34.320 --> 03:45:39.960]  Trump was really gonna be an agent of change a positive change to get rid of
[03:45:39.960 --> 03:45:42.640]  what's going on with the Federal Reserve and all that he would either be killed
[03:45:42.640 --> 03:45:45.720]  or he would be destroyed politically that's right of course he's been funding
[03:45:45.720 --> 03:45:48.960]  it on the other end he's been one of the people driving it buying politicians
[03:45:48.960 --> 03:45:53.160]  but I want to get back to this TSA thing for a moment because one of the
[03:45:53.160 --> 03:45:56.920]  things I think you notice that the guy walked away right set up Tom I wasn't
[03:45:56.920 --> 03:46:01.840]  going to put that camera down you cannot allow them to define what your country is
[03:46:01.840 --> 03:46:05.440]  you cannot make them force you through the machines if they force you through
[03:46:05.440 --> 03:46:09.000]  the machines they're going to force you into the concentration camps they're
[03:46:09.000 --> 03:46:12.760]  going to force you into the showers one day you have to stand up when we go
[03:46:12.760 --> 03:46:16.720]  through this when we opt out we're the only ones doing it anymore I don't see
[03:46:16.720 --> 03:46:19.920]  anybody doing it that's one of the reasons why this guy got so indignant
[03:46:19.920 --> 03:46:23.120]  about it yeah because we opted out in the first place this is so unusual they
[03:46:23.120 --> 03:46:27.560]  had to go get a supervisor to come do it because Americans have accepted this as
[03:46:27.560 --> 03:46:31.360]  reality that they live in so when we go through this we try to throw a monkey
[03:46:31.360 --> 03:46:34.840]  wrench in the system I know that it's not much but it's a monkey wrench but we
[03:46:34.840 --> 03:46:38.040]  throw a little plastic hollow monkey wrench when one person does it or one
[03:46:38.040 --> 03:46:42.600]  family does it it's easily crushed if the masses would stand up and say we're
[03:46:42.600 --> 03:46:46.000]  opting out we've tried to do this with people with the opt out we've organized
[03:46:46.000 --> 03:46:48.960]  that twice unless everybody opt out on this one day the first time they were
[03:46:48.960 --> 03:46:52.480]  very scared about it right they just completely opened up yeah all the gates
[03:46:52.480 --> 03:46:55.040]  and let everybody go through because they thought it was going to be a massive
[03:46:55.040 --> 03:46:59.360]  revolt against that so they're concerned about that we see every time people
[03:46:59.360 --> 03:47:02.040]  stand up to government whether it's the Bundy Ranch or whether it's other
[03:47:02.040 --> 03:47:06.000]  places they always will back down when you're in the right and we're in the
[03:47:06.000 --> 03:47:09.320]  right we have the law we have the Constitution on our side and you stood
[03:47:09.320 --> 03:47:13.960]  there you didn't yell you got his face but you did it very you did it very
[03:47:13.960 --> 03:47:19.540]  politely and and you and explained yourself and what you did it should be a
[03:47:19.540 --> 03:47:23.840]  model for people and how they should film the TSA and opt out I mean that
[03:47:23.840 --> 03:47:28.400]  this is that's a model strategy that you use well thanks I thought there was an
[03:47:28.400 --> 03:47:31.040]  article we had up yesterday I didn't have a chance to look at it because we're
[03:47:31.040 --> 03:47:35.000]  traveling but there was a pastor who stood up to an officer who was telling
[03:47:35.000 --> 03:47:38.080]  them that they had to go to the designated free speech area you don't
[03:47:38.080 --> 03:47:42.840]  have designated free speech areas the first amendment is not an area that was
[03:47:42.840 --> 03:47:45.360]  a sign that was up at the Bundy Ranch that got a lot of people upset but we
[03:47:45.360 --> 03:47:48.960]  we get used to these things at first people push back against right then
[03:47:48.960 --> 03:47:52.640]  they get used to it and we've seen this free speech suppression going on at
[03:47:52.640 --> 03:47:56.000]  every one of the political conventions Democrat and Republican for the last
[03:47:56.000 --> 03:48:00.280]  several cycles I take everybody who is there to protest and they stick them in
[03:48:00.280 --> 03:48:05.200]  a cage now in a cage not just enough to remove them away from the front of the
[03:48:05.200 --> 03:48:09.480]  place where they could be seen but to put them in a cage that's what we've done
[03:48:09.480 --> 03:48:13.480]  to our rights we've put them in a cage we've turned everything upside down the
[03:48:13.480 --> 03:48:17.720]  Constitution was meant to cage in the government not the people and now the
[03:48:17.720 --> 03:48:21.080]  people are using if they're allowed to use their first amendment is from a
[03:48:21.080 --> 03:48:24.480]  cage and then we tell people that we have to go to war and fight these other
[03:48:24.480 --> 03:48:28.200]  people to preserve our rights and our freedom when here at home we're
[03:48:28.200 --> 03:48:33.280]  systematically destroying what you know is really been a 200 plus year
[03:48:33.280 --> 03:48:37.840]  experiment yes yes and it's really a shame we got a few more minutes left I
[03:48:37.840 --> 03:48:41.680]  want to get to this garbage trucks begin to recording license plates for law
[03:48:41.680 --> 03:48:46.920]  enforcement so the garbage man's gonna be the new the new secret police and I
[03:48:46.920 --> 03:48:50.400]  have a clip this is from activist post they had a clip in here from the local
[03:48:50.400 --> 03:48:57.400]  television station in set of it's in Silicon Valley and let's roll that first
[03:48:57.400 --> 03:49:02.360]  clip is a different way to fight crime in a city facing a shortage of police
[03:49:02.360 --> 03:49:06.240]  officers but now San Jose is considering equipping garbage trucks with
[03:49:06.240 --> 03:49:10.800]  license plate readers as an extra set of eyes on the streets never thought of it
[03:49:10.800 --> 03:49:15.360]  that way but you know we're we live in a different world never in a million years
[03:49:15.360 --> 03:49:18.880]  did Steve Jones of Garden City Sanitation think his garbage trucks
[03:49:18.880 --> 03:49:22.960]  could be used for anything more than a pickup trash let alone a crime fighting
[03:49:22.960 --> 03:49:27.040]  tool I mean that'd be a pretty good day if we ended up having to drive by a car
[03:49:27.040 --> 03:49:34.400]  that was used to abduct a child and that child got saved help with amber
[03:49:34.400 --> 03:49:38.780]  lords and tracking stolen cars reasons the city of San Jose is exploring
[03:49:38.780 --> 03:49:44.160]  mounting license plate readers on garbage and recycling trucks there you
[03:49:44.160 --> 03:49:48.320]  go you know how much they're gonna cost $15,000 a piece you think they're
[03:49:48.320 --> 03:49:51.680]  concerned about stolen vehicles are like children now it's gonna be about
[03:49:51.680 --> 03:49:54.400]  serving warrants and giving people tickets that's right that's what it's
[03:49:54.400 --> 03:49:56.760]  gonna be about because they're gonna go by and say oh you were parked illegally
[03:49:56.760 --> 03:50:00.800]  mostly tickets yes we take it that's what it's all gonna be about it's nothing
[03:50:00.800 --> 03:50:03.800]  has nothing to do with safety it has nothing to do with finding stolen cars
[03:50:03.800 --> 03:50:08.280]  they're not gonna find one stolen car but they always use it as safety right
[03:50:08.280 --> 03:50:11.760]  and we're in the airport every couple of minutes there's a loop from the TSA
[03:50:11.760 --> 03:50:15.760]  safety is our number one concern it's not my number one concern we've gone
[03:50:15.760 --> 03:50:19.240]  from a country where our founder said give me liberty or give me death to this
[03:50:19.240 --> 03:50:22.840]  country where it's like safety so everything under the under the bus for
[03:50:22.840 --> 03:50:26.960]  safety literally under the bus safety for now yeah but you know what when you do
[03:50:26.960 --> 03:50:30.360]  that when you give up your liberty what are you you're a slave your prisoner
[03:50:30.360 --> 03:50:34.560]  prisoners and slaves are never safe and you deserve neither if you give up your
[03:50:34.560 --> 03:50:37.800]  liberty security you will get and deserve neither your liberty or security
[03:50:37.800 --> 03:50:41.600]  remember that out there when you are going through those TSA lines if you're
[03:50:41.600 --> 03:50:46.980]  not opting out you should be and film it film the Pat down they don't like it
[03:50:46.980 --> 03:50:50.960]  that's fine that's they got cameras everywhere all right film your opt-outs
[03:50:50.960 --> 03:50:55.240]  put them up on YouTube get other people involved all right we got one more

[03:54:45.040 --> 03:54:50.640]  warn parents about teachers and school officials who like to say that their
[03:54:50.640 --> 03:54:54.360]  children shouldn't be active or asked too many questions that happened to my
[03:54:54.360 --> 03:55:00.960]  son when he was diagnosed with ADHD when he was in the fifth grade and eight
[03:55:00.960 --> 03:55:08.960]  years ago he passed away at 19 ADHD drugs just really just really ruined
[03:55:08.960 --> 03:55:13.760]  him and I grew up in that era with the propaganda that whole just say no
[03:55:13.760 --> 03:55:19.600]  thing and so he tried to tell me that marijuana made him feel better but
[03:55:19.600 --> 03:55:22.120]  every time I caught him smoking I threw him in rehab and then every time I
[03:55:22.120 --> 03:55:26.960]  threw him in rehab they put him on an antipressant so instead of ADHD drugs then
[03:55:26.960 --> 03:55:31.920]  we added the that on top of it and I don't want any parent to ever have to go
[03:55:31.920 --> 03:55:36.960]  through what I did or my husband did when you have to bury a child it changes
[03:55:36.960 --> 03:55:42.840]  you and you're gonna fight all you can for the children because it's speed
[03:55:42.840 --> 03:55:46.760]  they're giving these kids speed yeah I know the doctors know that it's
[03:55:46.760 --> 03:55:52.160]  barbecuing system it just makes no sense and so that was my message and you
[03:55:52.160 --> 03:55:56.480]  guys are doing a great job I won't keep you and I'm so sorry you had to go
[03:55:56.480 --> 03:56:02.080]  through that David and and if you're doing a great job love the fourth hour
[03:56:02.080 --> 03:56:05.920]  well appreciate it tell your friends and family about it I definitely want to
[03:56:05.920 --> 03:56:09.360]  take more calls to especially get stories like yours because we got to warn
[03:56:09.360 --> 03:56:13.400]  people out there when when they're pushing these drugs on us we have to be
[03:56:13.400 --> 03:56:17.280]  able to stand up and and have the the information to know that you're not
[03:56:17.280 --> 03:56:20.840]  alone when you want to fight back and say no because there's other people out
[03:56:20.840 --> 03:56:24.800]  there that either didn't say no or they're learning from their mistakes or
[03:56:24.800 --> 03:56:30.000]  did say no and in time so very sorry to hear that Donna God bless you thank you
[03:56:30.000 --> 03:56:34.200]  for calling you've got some gun news it looks like what state is it they want
[03:56:34.200 --> 03:56:38.200]  to this is in Boston so Massachusetts they they're running this program up
[03:56:38.200 --> 03:56:42.120]  there where they're mailing legal gun owners and asking them to turn in their
[03:56:42.120 --> 03:56:45.120]  weapons or you know come to the gun buyback and they'll give you a little
[03:56:45.120 --> 03:56:48.600]  $300 gift certificate how do they know they have guns well that's a very
[03:56:48.600 --> 03:56:51.880]  interesting question Rob because every time we talk to these people say we
[03:56:51.880 --> 03:56:55.120]  want more gun control you guys conspiracy theorists to say that there's
[03:56:55.120 --> 03:56:58.760]  some type of gun registry well just like you mentioned how do they know who has
[03:56:58.760 --> 03:57:02.600]  a gun if there is no such thing as a gun registry the you know I'll tell you the
[03:57:02.600 --> 03:57:06.600]  ATF of the FBI they always destroy this information X number of days after it's
[03:57:06.600 --> 03:57:10.360]  been completed but somebody get a hold of this information just like we saw in
[03:57:10.360 --> 03:57:13.840]  New York last must have been going through Hillary's server that's what it was
[03:57:13.840 --> 03:57:19.080]  just like we saw last year in New York a project Veritas did a video about it how
[03:57:19.080 --> 03:57:23.200]  they had the concealed carriers all their information of database and some
[03:57:23.200 --> 03:57:26.800]  newspaper published it and then project Veritas goes out to the house is like
[03:57:26.800 --> 03:57:29.920]  hey you won't put this gun free zone sign in your front yard yeah I don't want to
[03:57:29.920 --> 03:57:34.840]  do that somebody's gonna break in you think wow surprise surprise surprise
[03:57:34.840 --> 03:57:39.220]  basic common sense but to say something real quick about the TSA which you and
[03:57:39.220 --> 03:57:42.400]  David were talking about I had an experience the last time I got on the
[03:57:42.400 --> 03:57:46.640]  plane I think we went to Arkansas mm-hmm I just went going through the pat down
[03:57:46.640 --> 03:57:49.960]  and the guy actually opened my bag and the silliest thing I've ever seen the
[03:57:49.960 --> 03:57:54.000]  TSA do they open a can of Altoids they were shaking the can of Altoids trying
[03:57:54.000 --> 03:57:58.000]  to see what was inside I was like bro it's it's Altoids and they take stuff out
[03:57:58.000 --> 03:58:01.960]  my bag and they're rubbing down my camera batteries with oh yeah and stuff I'm
[03:58:01.960 --> 03:58:08.080]  just the most ridiculous what you got here boy yeah just just silly this it's
[03:58:08.080 --> 03:58:11.800]  a ridiculous society we're living in now and we have to fight back or it's
[03:58:11.800 --> 03:58:14.520]  only you to get more ridiculous they're gonna start telling you what to say how
[03:58:14.520 --> 03:58:19.560]  to say it who to talk to who not to talk to we have to stand up and that's why
[03:58:19.560 --> 03:58:23.640]  we're here and that's why we're doing the fourth hour to get five hours of
[03:58:23.640 --> 03:58:29.000]  programming a day here at info wars.com Central Texas Command Center I'm Rob
