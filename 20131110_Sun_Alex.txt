[00:00.000 --> 00:08.160]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of
[00:08.160 --> 00:15.560]  tyranny over the mind of man. Thomas Jefferson. It's Alex Jones on the GCN
[00:15.560 --> 00:18.760]  radio network.
[00:18.760 --> 00:33.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back. It is Sunday. We have returned since the
[00:33.280 --> 00:42.920]  Friday transmission. It is already the 10th day of November 2013 and we're
[00:42.920 --> 00:47.800]  going to be live here at Lord willing as we are every Sunday 4 to 6 p.m. Central
[00:47.800 --> 00:56.360]  Standard Time. Now we are going to be having several guests on with us during
[00:56.360 --> 01:03.720]  the broadcast today. We're going to have Joel Scousen of the World Affairs Brief
[01:03.720 --> 01:08.120]  joining us at the bottom of the hour to talk about the pivot from the Middle
[01:08.120 --> 01:13.000]  East supposedly militarily to Asia and all the incredible war drums from China
[01:13.000 --> 01:19.600]  and the United States military drills outside each other's nations
[01:19.600 --> 01:25.920]  simultaneously Chinese drills of arriving during an economic or natural
[01:25.920 --> 01:34.400]  disaster in the Pacific Islands of Hawaii. That's going on right now. We've
[01:34.400 --> 01:41.800]  got serious geopolitical changes that are taking place across the world right
[01:41.800 --> 01:47.000]  now and Joel Scousen editor of the World Affairs Brief will be joining us
[01:47.000 --> 01:52.000]  coming up at the bottom of the hour and in the last 30 minutes we have
[01:52.000 --> 01:57.480]  Laura Presley coming in. She's a local Austinite and has been an activist I've
[01:57.480 --> 02:03.800]  known for I guess about a decade or so but she has successfully along with
[02:03.800 --> 02:10.520]  Austinites and the show and others gotten law in through the city council that
[02:10.520 --> 02:18.840]  you'd be able to opt out of the spy meters the NSA scam devices that
[02:18.840 --> 02:23.800]  literally track every appliance in your house that are smart as well and also
[02:23.800 --> 02:29.880]  gouges you with the prices on record and can control your thermostat and more.
[02:29.880 --> 02:34.520]  This is the real revolution against tyranny. I'm all for technology if it's
[02:34.520 --> 02:39.760]  neutral. The problem is all the technology is being globally standardized all the
[02:39.760 --> 02:44.200]  major technological rollouts to spy on everyone and to control our lives and give
[02:44.200 --> 02:50.000]  the upper hand to dubious corrupt corporations and we know that Enron
[02:50.000 --> 02:53.560]  basically pioneered 15 years ago the development of these things that are
[02:53.560 --> 02:57.320]  proliferating worldwide so whereas you have the civil rights movement so black
[02:57.320 --> 03:00.480]  folks could vote and before that you have the suffrage movement other things
[03:00.480 --> 03:03.640]  you have the second amendment movement the fight against King George there's
[03:03.640 --> 03:08.440]  always a continuation of new battles and really it's all of us being attacked by
[03:08.440 --> 03:13.280]  the surveillance grid. Speaking of that up on drugsreport.com on the right-hand
[03:13.280 --> 03:20.400]  side is a article from storyleak.com Las Vegas installs in
[03:20.400 --> 03:26.080]  tele streets light fixtures capable of recording conversations and even the
[03:26.080 --> 03:30.640]  local news was critical of them we're gonna play that clip and tie it into the
[03:30.640 --> 03:35.480]  voice recognition software that they've got hooked into these and they don't
[03:35.480 --> 03:38.960]  want you to be aware of that. Two years ago they came out and bragged about it
[03:38.960 --> 03:43.360]  in promos and were given billions of Homeland Security funding to put these
[03:43.360 --> 03:47.480]  in in towns all over the United States and worldwide it's happening England's
[03:47.480 --> 03:51.520]  really the capital of this they shout orders at you they spy on you they
[03:51.520 --> 03:58.320]  face scan you but the big thing is the audio is 360 and can go hundreds and
[03:58.320 --> 04:02.280]  hundreds of yards and they have your voice print folks your voice prints been
[04:02.280 --> 04:06.280]  captured been chronicle just like your face print be a driver's license photos
[04:06.280 --> 04:10.160]  and now all these companies you go and take digital photos to get your smart
[04:10.160 --> 04:16.080]  card or your gem card that is then sold into consortium databases I blew the
[04:16.080 --> 04:20.360]  whistle on this 15 years ago not because I'm a rocket scientist they've had big
[04:20.360 --> 04:26.760]  consortium tech meetings in London Chicago New York Tokyo where you can
[04:26.760 --> 04:31.800]  read the text of what the the major telecom heads and shony heads and all of
[04:31.800 --> 04:36.080]  them Microsoft heads they admit all this how they're gonna track everything
[04:36.080 --> 04:40.120]  you do in real time your voice will be used to purchase you've got already got
[04:40.120 --> 04:44.240]  for three years Facebook kiosk up where you walk by and it goes hey Alex Jones
[04:44.240 --> 04:48.360]  that's you you're on Facebook your best buddy in high school was and it just

[05:00.680 --> 05:03.600]  of the most important information concerning you and your family's

[05:07.360 --> 05:10.760]  northern hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological
[05:10.760 --> 05:14.960]  accidents radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply there's
[05:14.960 --> 05:19.600]  only two ways to avoid this move south of the equator or properly protect your
[05:19.600 --> 05:24.160]  thyroid with nascent iodine looking to protect my family I've done deep research

[05:52.920 --> 06:00.040]  iodine today at info wars life dot com that's info wars life dot com
[06:04.840 --> 06:10.120]  in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of
[06:10.120 --> 06:15.400]  unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial
[06:15.400 --> 06:20.040]  commonwealth in Dallas Texas three shots were fired at president Kennedy's
[06:20.040 --> 06:24.880]  motorcade in downtown Dallas the first report to play at a president Kennedy
[06:24.880 --> 06:34.320]  has been seriously wounded by the shooting it is a big idea a new order
[06:34.920 --> 06:43.440]  it was almost as if we were planned to implode it just pancakes either you were
[06:43.440 --> 06:59.000]  with us or you were with the terrorists
[06:59.000 --> 07:03.880]  but I also believe a lot of gun owners would agree that AK-47s belong in hands
[07:03.880 --> 07:07.320]  of soldiers not in the hands of criminals
[07:07.320 --> 07:13.320]  guns will be caked and no one will be able to be off we can take all of them
[07:13.320 --> 07:17.240]  for many of the police and guard troops it is an uncomfortable job to do this in
[07:17.240 --> 07:21.600]  an American city global governance at last is it one world the central bank
[07:21.600 --> 07:25.560]  is in charge but aren't we all just living and dying from what the central
[07:25.560 --> 07:31.880]  banks do and for me give me liberty or give me death

[09:54.240 --> 09:59.560]  spy meters the scam meters the NSA surveillance meters the imperial
[09:59.560 --> 10:04.840]  probe droids that they attach on the side of your house to spy on you she's
[10:04.840 --> 10:09.440]  going to be joining us in the last 30 minutes in studio of the two-hour Sunday

[10:14.920 --> 10:20.880]  planet calm and then we have the nightly news site info wars news calm prison
[10:20.880 --> 10:28.680]  planet TV will also take you there as well now we've got a lot of other news
[10:28.680 --> 10:34.760]  obviously we need to get into big news on not just smart meters literally tying
[10:34.760 --> 10:38.440]  into all the other quote smart appliances by design and spying on you and
[10:38.440 --> 10:42.480]  controlling your thermostat is in Ron designed it to do back in their old
[10:42.480 --> 10:47.040]  scam days yeah Enron's been destroyed and their leader has died before going to
[10:47.040 --> 10:52.760]  jail like Bernie Madoff you know is basically in jail but the the the
[10:52.760 --> 10:57.920]  frauds they developed the carbon taxes the smart meters the scam meters are
[10:57.920 --> 11:04.320]  still with us but we're going to get in the next segment into a local Las Vegas
[11:04.320 --> 11:09.680]  news story that's on local TV Las Vegas installs in tell the streets light
[11:09.680 --> 11:16.360]  fixtures under Homeland Security grants that listen to you now now why this is
[11:16.360 --> 11:20.360]  important folks is when they sort of put in cameras under federal grants 20 years
[11:20.360 --> 11:24.880]  in 20 years ago they said oh it's only for traffic now they admit no we're
[11:24.880 --> 11:27.720]  spying on everything you do and we want to make it the law that all private
[11:27.720 --> 11:31.400]  cameras have to be hooked into our grid to spy on you and most new cameras like
[11:31.400 --> 11:35.360]  computers have built-in microphones that's the big Homeland Security push
[11:35.360 --> 11:38.800]  when you hear your police chief pushing that they're they're literally just
[11:38.800 --> 11:44.720]  federal DHS operatives this is not about security it's about control but with the
[11:44.720 --> 11:49.920]  voice print analysis systems that are very inexpensive and are and are hooked
[11:49.920 --> 11:54.640]  into these hubs they know who you are from your voice and it's all being
[11:54.640 --> 12:00.280]  recorded and they call them gunshot detectors Austin had them put in in 98
[12:00.280 --> 12:04.760]  most other big cities have them in now as well and they have them in parks you
[12:04.760 --> 12:10.000]  name it listening to you recording it and they have your voice print analysis
[12:10.000 --> 12:14.120]  so there's the rest of story I'm going to tell that in the next segment but first
[12:14.120 --> 12:20.520]  off a McClatchy DC reports analysis tens of millions could be forced out of
[12:20.520 --> 12:26.200]  health insurance they had no no they've already forced two million three weeks
[12:26.200 --> 12:30.040]  ago then five million now it's about eight million it's going to be more like
[12:30.040 --> 12:35.320]  25 mil but that's just kicking you directly off of it they're also on
[12:35.320 --> 12:39.960]  average have now doubled it you mana it's going up 500 plus percent in Texas
[12:39.960 --> 12:44.440]  that's all been announced the insurance companies wrote this to literally
[12:44.440 --> 12:48.360]  screw you over if you're not an illegal alien you're not going to get free care
[12:48.360 --> 12:52.320]  the illegals will get it free care to bring them in to drive down wages it's
[12:52.320 --> 12:56.240]  an incentive that's why they don't tell you know half the country's basically
[12:56.240 --> 13:00.280]  going on part-time under Obamacare but lower wages further and you're told now
[13:00.280 --> 13:05.640]  DHS their health and human services two weeks ago shed the news it's okay tell
[13:05.640 --> 13:10.520]  your employees go on supplementary assistance it's cloud and piven
[13:10.520 --> 13:16.360]  sociology plan if totally domesticated you will not be able under the system
[13:16.360 --> 13:20.160]  most people on average to not be on welfare so we went from 25 million on
[13:20.160 --> 13:24.480]  food stamps to 50 million in six years it's going to be a hundred mil it's already
[13:24.480 --> 13:30.040]  101 mil on some form of welfare it's going to be 200 mil just like France just
[13:30.040 --> 13:34.200]  like Russia this is how they do it it's a plan so I thought I would actually go
[13:34.200 --> 13:41.880]  over here for you today what Obama actually has done in his deception this
[13:41.880 --> 13:46.760]  finally the public finally picked up on this and noticed it you remember Obama
[13:46.760 --> 13:52.760]  saying at least now 50 plus times that you can keep your insurance back when
[13:52.760 --> 13:58.480]  they were trying to pass it in 2009 we will keep this promise to the American
[13:58.480 --> 14:04.800]  people if you like your doctor you will be able to keep your doctor period if
[14:04.800 --> 14:09.520]  you like your health care plan you will be able to keep your health care plan
[14:09.520 --> 14:22.720]  period no matter what you've heard if you
[14:22.720 --> 14:27.920]  like your doctor or health care plan you can keep it if you like your doctor
[14:27.920 --> 14:32.680]  you can keep your doctor if you like your private health insurance that's
[14:32.680 --> 14:39.680]  enough you can keep it goes on and on forever then he came out last week and
[14:39.680 --> 14:46.000]  said he said you could keep it before the law passed a total fraud so so then he
[14:46.000 --> 14:50.000]  lied but then that blew up in his face and then he came back and said I'm sorry
[14:50.000 --> 14:54.440]  but let's go ahead and go to him lying last week and saying I didn't really say
[14:54.440 --> 15:01.400]  that here it is or had one of these plans before the Affordable Care Act came
[15:01.400 --> 15:09.960]  into law and you really like that plan what we said was you could keep it if it
[15:09.960 --> 15:17.520]  hasn't changed since the laws passed let's play that clip for folks one more
[15:17.520 --> 15:24.600]  time so they can hear the absolute craven deception if you have or had one of
[15:24.600 --> 15:30.320]  these plans before the Affordable Care Act came into law and you really like
[15:30.320 --> 15:38.280]  that plan what we said was you could keep it if it hasn't changed since the
[15:38.280 --> 15:43.160]  laws passed and that is not what he said he said under this bill you can keep it
[15:43.160 --> 15:47.560]  period so so there he is lying now when we come back he gets caught in the line
[15:47.560 --> 15:54.040]  and apologizes but there's a new video dug up off C-span where he admits four
[15:54.040 --> 15:58.160]  years ago he lied that he was going to lie to everybody

[20:05.760 --> 20:19.200]  Broadcasting Network live from Austin Texas Broadcasting Worldwide it's Alex
[20:19.200 --> 20:28.320]  Jones all right so we're analyzing here how Obama deceives people so first he
[20:28.320 --> 20:35.040]  says hundreds of times 50 plus videos we found keeps growing but we know it's
[20:35.040 --> 20:38.560]  hundreds of times in different speeches that you'll keep your plan period so
[20:38.560 --> 20:41.400]  you said I'm not gonna hire a single lobbyist and hired record numbers I'm
[20:41.400 --> 20:45.480]  not gonna increase the number to cut it in half doubled it I'm not coming up
[20:45.480 --> 20:50.760]  your guns came after him just everything he says it's the opposite gonna stop
[20:50.760 --> 20:55.640]  spying on you illegally increases it not a fight al Qaeda openly funds al Qaeda and
[20:55.640 --> 21:00.760]  Libby and Syria whatever he says it's the opposite unless it's abortion he will
[21:00.760 --> 21:05.240]  you know try to fund basically forced abortions in African places so he will
[21:05.240 --> 21:10.280]  will do that now now I played him saying you can keep it then I played him
[21:10.280 --> 21:13.600]  saying no no I meant until the bill passes no he's like under this bill you
[21:13.600 --> 21:18.840]  can keep it period then he said okay you know I never said that then that didn't
[21:18.840 --> 21:23.880]  work so a few days ago what on Thursday he apologized and said I'm sorry I am
[21:23.880 --> 21:29.400]  sorry that they you know are finding themselves in this situation based on
[21:29.400 --> 21:35.480]  assurances they got for me we've got to work hard to make sure that they know we
[21:35.480 --> 21:40.000]  hear them and that we're gonna do everything we can to deal with folks
[21:40.000 --> 21:44.520]  who find themselves in a tough position as a consequence of this you put them in
[21:44.520 --> 21:49.160]  this position with a bunch of foreign banks that wrote this to shut down their
[21:49.160 --> 21:53.000]  competition make everybody buy insurance kick people off their existing
[21:53.000 --> 21:59.080]  insurance and double triple and quadruple premiums and by the way I had
[21:59.080 --> 22:02.280]  said it's 8 to 10 million currently kicked off just actually reading the
[22:02.280 --> 22:06.400]  fine print Obama is saying tens of millions now
[22:06.400 --> 22:12.000]  McClatchy is reporting 52 million are gonna be kicked off and that their real
[22:12.000 --> 22:16.080]  journalism by the way if you want to know real journalism in America that's
[22:16.080 --> 22:19.960]  more establishment the only dinosaur media that I see that actually ever
[22:19.960 --> 22:23.920]  reports anything real maybe Wall Street Journal every once in a while the LA
[22:23.920 --> 22:29.920]  Times but Wired magazine McClatchy over and over again I mean McClatchy's the
[22:29.920 --> 22:33.240]  folks that went Warren Buffett's lobbying for tax increases on the on the
[22:33.240 --> 22:37.320]  middle class to pay him Banker bailout money while he's exempt I mean they they
[22:37.320 --> 22:43.600]  do a pretty darn good job and they've done the analysis it's 52 million drudge
[22:43.600 --> 22:48.160]  report.com has it right there need to get this up on info wars.com but folks
[22:48.160 --> 22:52.960]  should go read that it's the middle column right now now here's the new video
[22:52.960 --> 23:02.400]  we dug up it's up on info wars.com and this is Obama in 2010 right you know
[23:02.400 --> 23:07.320]  when they're trying to like finagle writers on the bills the bill 3,000
[23:07.320 --> 23:11.480]  pages but 10,000 plus pages of addendums were added on and he's in there
[23:11.480 --> 23:16.160]  talking to different senators and this is Obama and Cantor at Health Care
[23:16.160 --> 23:21.880]  Commission with the House the Senate and the executive meeting and so Obama can't
[23:21.880 --> 23:26.120]  sit here he knows nobody watches C-Span really so he's outlined to his
[23:26.120 --> 23:29.960]  constituents saying look period it's a lie I'll never lose it that's made up
[23:29.960 --> 23:36.640]  right-wing extremism but to Cantor and others he explains to him well no it'll
[23:36.640 --> 23:42.880]  only be eight or nine million under this that lose their insurance so this is
[23:42.880 --> 23:48.320]  conscious lying and by the way Obama's a puppet but he's actually in there
[23:48.320 --> 23:51.880]  running a lot of stuff as well he's constitutional lawyer he's a smart guy
[23:51.880 --> 23:57.040]  he helped write the NDAA to disappear Americans with the Attorney General and
[23:57.040 --> 24:00.040]  secretly arrest us and they tell the military they can just kill Americans
[24:00.040 --> 24:04.040]  secretly whenever they want now total treason Hitler level stuff he wrote it
[24:04.040 --> 24:06.640]  and then said he was going to vote against it and then signed it and then
[24:06.640 --> 24:09.720]  it came out he engineered the whole thing and was telling the Senate don't
[24:09.720 --> 24:15.000]  tell him I wrote it but he was in there in phone calls in meetings I want to
[24:15.000 --> 24:19.720]  secretly arrest people I mean totally creepy and it's the same thing here he
[24:19.720 --> 24:22.560]  is in a real meeting with the Senate going yeah we're gonna kick people off
[24:22.560 --> 24:28.120]  their insurance while he's out on meet the press saying the opposite that is
[24:28.120 --> 24:31.240]  sneakiness that's but it's not even sneakiness because they do it right
[24:31.240 --> 24:36.120]  out front everybody it's arrogance folks and it's knowing the dinosaur media the
[24:36.120 --> 24:40.520]  state-run media AP calls me New York Times calls me New York magazines
[24:40.520 --> 24:44.440]  they're all calling me every day I call them back and go write whatever you want
[24:44.440 --> 24:48.400]  state-run media you're a dead dinosaur politically go ahead make up what
[24:48.400 --> 24:51.200]  everyone and they're like but you don't want to know who make up whatever you
[24:51.200 --> 24:58.040]  want and then I hang the phone up I love it I love it you people are already a
[24:58.040 --> 25:03.000]  joke now let's go ahead let's go the only people that are smart are the ones
[25:03.000 --> 25:07.040]  they're gonna stay around remember that and tell the truth the public wants the
[25:07.040 --> 25:11.760]  truth folks they're done with liars oh if you question known liars you're a
[25:11.760 --> 25:15.560]  conspiracy there is oh I'm loving it you oh really it's all coming true just
[25:15.560 --> 25:20.120]  like we said I have credibility you don't people that tell the truth that
[25:20.120 --> 25:23.800]  credibility we have credibility you don't have credibility so you're thinking
[25:23.800 --> 25:27.800]  about where you have the credibility it's all over so let's go ahead and now
[25:27.800 --> 25:33.680]  go to Obama three years ago in a meeting admitting it would kick people off here
[25:33.680 --> 25:38.240]  it is and because I don't think that you can answer the question in the positive
[25:38.240 --> 25:41.960]  to say that people will be able to maintain their coverage people the
[25:41.960 --> 25:46.560]  representative Eric Cantor they want in the kind of bill that you're proposing
[25:46.560 --> 25:52.480]  well let me since you asked me a question let me respond the eight and to
[25:52.480 --> 25:55.720]  nine million people that you refer to that might have to change their coverage
[25:55.720 --> 25:59.400]  out keep in mind out of the 300 million Americans that we're talking about
[25:59.400 --> 26:04.120]  will be folks who the CBO the Congressional Budget Office estimates
[26:04.120 --> 26:09.960]  would would find the deal in the exchange better total for a better deal
[26:09.960 --> 26:13.120]  total so yes they would change coverage because they've got more choice in
[26:13.120 --> 26:18.120]  competition so let's just be clear about that point number one
[26:18.120 --> 26:25.420]  that's enough that's enough so there they are literally just selling the greatest
[26:25.420 --> 26:29.920]  bull you could ever imagine in their face now let's shift gears to a story
[26:29.920 --> 26:36.160]  from info wars.com and story leak.com is where originally appeared it's up on
[26:36.160 --> 26:40.120]  drudgereport.com is the easiest place to find it on the right hand middle area
[26:40.120 --> 26:46.040]  right there this is a local TV station and we'll give you the call letter
[26:46.040 --> 26:51.640]  certain a moment once we play it and here they are talking about the
[26:51.640 --> 26:55.480]  IntelliStreet system that oh can listen to it if they decide to turn the
[26:55.480 --> 27:01.160]  microphone on but the issue is they have voice recognition and homeland
[27:01.160 --> 27:07.000]  security is paying for this and this is to listen to you I was told this by
[27:07.000 --> 27:13.520]  Time Warner executives and AT&T executives 15 years ago and broke that
[27:13.520 --> 27:16.560]  your cable boxes and cell phones everything we're watching you listening to
[27:16.560 --> 27:21.160]  you okay just like your new computers are watching you the NSA they've already
[27:21.160 --> 27:24.000]  committed a billion crimes why not commit a billion more let's go to part of
[27:24.000 --> 27:28.880]  this newscast. This technology you know is taking us to a place where you
[27:28.880 --> 27:32.720]  essentially will be monitored from the moment you leave your home to the moment
[27:32.720 --> 27:37.320]  you get home. Daphne Lee is a privacy advocate who worries our freedoms are
[27:37.320 --> 27:41.520]  quickly disappearing illuminating concepts the company who designed
[27:41.520 --> 27:46.320]  IntelliStreets is based in Philadelphia. The IntelliStreets processors store and
[27:46.320 --> 27:52.400]  analyze data, soundtracks, announcements, commercials and even video files. According
[27:52.400 --> 27:57.200]  to their own marketing video the lights they manufacture are adaptable capable
[27:57.200 --> 28:02.640]  of adding cameras for surveillance and security and even recording devices. Yes
[28:02.640 --> 28:07.560]  the same street lights now being tested in Las Vegas could someday be set up to
[28:07.560 --> 28:11.600]  record conversations from every day. Let's stop right there I'm gonna have to get to
[28:11.600 --> 28:15.760]  this when Joel Scowles and leaves us in about 45 minutes from now because it's
[28:15.760 --> 28:18.000]  so important I've got to get into it but I wanted to give you the rest of the
[28:18.000 --> 28:23.000]  story. Ladies and gentlemen they're not testing this okay we we broke this two
[28:23.000 --> 28:26.640]  years ago and that's in the article the two articles from two years ago that
[28:26.640 --> 28:31.800]  Paul Watson wrote about it but here's the Washington Post with a headline
[28:31.800 --> 28:36.240]  shot spotter detection system document at 39,000 shooting incidents in the
[28:36.240 --> 28:42.480]  district last year. Folks they call them gunshot detectors they're really audio
[28:42.480 --> 28:45.520]  systems and they are listening to you and that even comes out in the
[28:45.520 --> 28:48.320]  literature so let's get that straight. The reason this is important is they're
[28:48.320 --> 28:52.960]  now admitting they're listening to you okay and they know who you are and it
[28:52.960 --> 28:58.760]  all goes into the threat fusion centers it is beyond 1984.
[28:59.240 --> 29:03.760]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers the prognosis for the
[29:03.760 --> 29:08.800]  entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse. The globalist model
[29:08.800 --> 29:14.040]  is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the
[29:14.040 --> 29:17.320]  global takeover. That's why we've assembled the most vital and important
[29:17.320 --> 29:22.720]  preparedness items at info wars shop.com. These are items that I did research on

[31:13.560 --> 31:19.200]  It has always been my belief that it's key to stand behind companies who share

[32:12.720 --> 32:17.840]  down to one thing. We are what we eat. Our food is devoid of nutrition and
[32:17.840 --> 32:22.920]  processed with poisons and additives. Our water is filled with toxic poisons and

[33:47.280 --> 33:50.880]  but you know what's made America great and one of the freest countries in
[33:50.880 --> 33:55.080]  history is that our forebears were deeply concerned with their liberties and
[33:55.080 --> 34:00.080]  with freedom and with family rights and property rights and religious rights and
[34:00.080 --> 34:06.240]  we are now losing those very very rapidly and becoming a standard of tyranny
[34:06.240 --> 34:11.480]  worldwide and some folks that have been fighting for 60-plus years against
[34:11.480 --> 34:15.880]  tyranny is the Scousen family. A lot of them are very prolific and really
[34:15.880 --> 34:20.280]  exposing the heart of what's going on. Of course Cleon Scousen wrote the best
[34:20.280 --> 34:25.080]  selling naked communist back in the 50s and I remember there were several
[34:25.080 --> 34:33.400]  copies at my father's father's home farmhouse ranch. The whole house is full
[34:33.400 --> 34:36.080]  of books but there were several copies of that. I remember reading it when I was
[34:36.080 --> 34:39.440]  about 12 and I already read so many history books it made perfect sense that
[34:39.440 --> 34:43.360]  there are powerful elites that aren't free market. They use communism and
[34:43.360 --> 34:47.120]  socialism and cloward and piven who came out in the 60s a program to
[34:47.120 --> 34:53.640]  domesticate the population so you have control of them. So since then of course
[34:53.640 --> 34:57.280]  Joel Scousen's written many best-selling books and runs World Affairs Brief. He's
[34:57.280 --> 35:00.120]  his nephew and the reason I introduced that is they've been fighting this
[35:00.120 --> 35:04.840]  tyranny for a long time. He was a Marine Corps fighter pilot before that and of
[35:04.840 --> 35:09.600]  course he joins us now until about 25 after next hour then I'll get back to
[35:09.600 --> 35:13.160]  that surveillance news and then we have a guest joining us in studio with fighting
[35:13.160 --> 35:18.160]  the smart meters that are nothing but big brother trod meters. They also are
[35:18.160 --> 35:21.680]  overcharged folks on record so we're gonna have a guest in here who's
[35:21.680 --> 35:26.080]  successfully helping battle that in Austin, Texas a model for others but
[35:26.080 --> 35:29.600]  he's the editor at World Affairs Brief.com and the reason I wanted to
[35:29.600 --> 35:34.800]  get him on is we made a film about a year ago that's on DVD called strategic
[35:34.800 --> 35:40.920]  relocation based on his best-selling book. He's also probably the top secure
[35:40.920 --> 35:45.160]  home advisor in the country and the best-seller of the v-secure home. We saw
[35:45.160 --> 35:49.920]  all those two books and the film at m4store.com but I'm not here to plug
[35:49.920 --> 35:53.600]  that today. I wanted to get him on he's on the road we appreciate him joining us
[35:53.600 --> 35:57.720]  on short notice because just watching the news the last week I'd already thought
[35:57.720 --> 36:03.200]  this but Rob Jacobson ran in here Friday and goes look at the CFR they're
[36:03.200 --> 36:06.200]  saying we're gonna have war with China and that's the new enemy and the pivot
[36:06.200 --> 36:10.200]  out east and the submarines off our coast and the missile test and all the
[36:10.200 --> 36:14.200]  news and Jacobson's crammed a big stack of media in my hands. I'm gonna show
[36:14.200 --> 36:18.680]  viewers radio listeners I'll read it out for you. China unveils its secretive
[36:18.680 --> 36:25.960]  nuclear submarine fleet for the first time in four decades. That's a report out
[36:25.960 --> 36:31.600]  of the Miami news. Here's another one out of Como news out of Seattle. Chinese
[36:31.600 --> 36:35.640]  media show Seattle's potential nuclear target that came out last week.
[36:35.640 --> 36:42.400]  Rand suggests using land-based ACMs against China. Here's another one is
[36:42.400 --> 36:46.920]  China prepared to force a showdown with Japan and they're also having a drill
[36:46.920 --> 36:52.160]  though of China landing during a civil or emergency disasters or other
[36:52.160 --> 36:56.880]  disasters a natural disaster in Hawaii so we got that report up on info wars.com
[36:56.880 --> 37:00.800]  here's the Washington Free Beacon. China deploys a new bomber with long-range
[37:00.800 --> 37:05.680]  land attack missile. U.S. is the target and then we've got all these counsel on
[37:05.680 --> 37:09.280]  foreign relations put out books. I'm not gonna have time to get into that because I
[37:09.280 --> 37:13.120]  want to get to our guest where they basically say prepare for that and this
[37:13.120 --> 37:20.040]  is while selling us out to China to a great extent. Now Joel Scalzen joins us
[37:20.040 --> 37:23.240]  and Joel I want to give you the floor and the rest of this segment to try to
[37:23.240 --> 37:27.120]  geopolitically because you really have been the first and main person for a
[37:27.120 --> 37:33.160]  decade or longer saying this will be what developed and explain the three
[37:33.160 --> 37:37.400]  power blocks to people in the next five six minutes we're gonna break act like
[37:37.400 --> 37:41.480]  we've got new listeners which we do every five seconds who don't understand
[37:41.480 --> 37:45.480]  this and explain to them the three power blocks and what we're facing and it
[37:45.480 --> 37:50.040]  really scares me that everything you say continues to come out just exactly as
[37:50.040 --> 37:53.280]  you've said it so tell us what's currently happening and then stare into
[37:53.280 --> 37:57.840]  that political crystal ball and tell us tell us what's coming. Well thanks Alex
[37:57.840 --> 38:03.360]  it's good to be with you again as I've written in several of my publications
[38:03.360 --> 38:07.400]  and talked about in the World Affairs brief there are three major predator or
[38:07.400 --> 38:13.000]  power centers in the world and they are the Anglo-American globalists which we
[38:13.000 --> 38:18.440]  have to deal with directly there are the Russians and the Chinese and each of
[38:18.440 --> 38:23.800]  these are separate predator centers each one setting themselves up someday to
[38:23.800 --> 38:30.920]  control their own version of the new world order and the Russians and Chinese
[38:30.920 --> 38:35.320]  are in temporary alliance planning on taking down the West they've been
[38:35.320 --> 38:41.200]  preparing for decades for this and the West has been keeping ahead of them in
[38:41.200 --> 38:46.400]  terms of weapons technology and in fact giving technology second level
[38:46.400 --> 38:52.640]  technology to the Russians and Chinese in order to help get them to the point
[38:52.640 --> 38:58.280]  where they are confident enough to take on the West and you might ask why would
[38:58.280 --> 39:02.160]  the West for your new readers why would the West want to be suicidal enough to
[39:02.160 --> 39:07.560]  want the Russians and Chinese to attack us. Well as Cleon explained in the
[39:07.560 --> 39:11.680]  making communists they've used the West or the communists and they brought
[39:11.680 --> 39:14.720]  communism to power they brought the Russians to power they gave them the
[39:14.720 --> 39:19.000]  first nuclear bomb materials be able to set off the first nuclear bomb a year
[39:19.000 --> 39:23.320]  after Hiroshima they brought the Chinese to power through cutting up on to
[39:23.320 --> 39:27.560]  Chiang Kai-shek all for the preliminary purpose of breaking down other
[39:27.560 --> 39:30.680]  governments so they didn't get blamed for it let the communists break them down
[39:30.680 --> 39:35.160]  the globalists come in and have an excuse then to remove communists and
[39:35.160 --> 39:40.920]  replace them with globalists but ultimately they're going to allow the
[39:40.920 --> 39:45.560]  Russians and Chinese to do a creative nuclear strike on America that's why
[39:45.560 --> 39:50.800]  the United States issued PDD 60 presidential decision director 60 in
[39:50.800 --> 39:55.680]  1997 under President Bill Clinton basically telling our nuclear forces
[39:55.680 --> 40:01.040]  don't depend on launch on mourning in other words be prepared to launch a
[40:01.040 --> 40:07.320]  retaliatory strike after you absorb a first strike from an enemy and of course
[40:07.320 --> 40:10.800]  general butch Neil at the time the assistant commandant of the Marine
[40:10.800 --> 40:14.880]  Corps said retaliate with what once you've absorbed a nuclear first strike
[40:14.880 --> 40:21.720]  you haven't got much left to retaliate with but my overall general theory which
[40:21.720 --> 40:25.320]  I'm presenting now before I go into what's really happening with what you
[40:25.320 --> 40:30.200]  said is that the globalists want this strike so they can come out of their
[40:30.200 --> 40:34.720]  bunkers claim innocence that the Russians and Chinese have deceived us or
[40:34.720 --> 40:39.320]  deceived them but they didn't know about this strike come and that because our
[40:39.320 --> 40:43.920]  military has been decapitated in that strike that they'll now be able to go
[40:43.920 --> 40:49.360]  to us into accepting a militarized new world order to prosecute World War three
[40:49.360 --> 40:53.360]  okay Joe Joe again when you join us on short notice you're working on a
[40:53.360 --> 40:57.640]  business trip via Skype on an internal mic on your computer it's pretty
[40:57.640 --> 41:01.160]  audible but this is so important I want to get you on a landline or a cell phone
[41:01.160 --> 41:04.320]  during this break we're going to break we're going to get you back on to recap
[41:04.320 --> 41:08.000]  that and then talk about where you see this going in the future so we're going
[41:08.000 --> 41:11.840]  to call him back right now via cell thank you Joel Joel Scowze we're gonna keep
[41:11.840 --> 41:18.640]  you on Skype for visuals for the viewers out there as well but again we have him
[41:18.640 --> 41:23.360]  on via short notice very very important information and I hope you're all
[41:23.360 --> 41:28.840]  listening and understanding that their private interest that and the Communist
[41:28.840 --> 41:31.960]  Party in the case of China private interest corporate interest in the case
[41:31.960 --> 41:36.240]  of Russia but but really private mega banking interest in control of the US
[41:36.240 --> 41:41.400]  predator states who are preparing a underground government a hardened
[41:41.400 --> 41:47.440]  government a COG continuity of government shadow government and then
[41:47.440 --> 41:51.000]  using the nuclear attack they're pushing for as a way to wipe out our old
[41:51.000 --> 41:56.400]  Republic fully they'll also use a civil war between patriots and and the police
[41:56.400 --> 41:59.880]  and military they want us to fight each other that's also one of their plans we
[41:59.880 --> 42:04.600]  did not let that happen so that they can then have the Republic rise again as a
[42:04.600 --> 42:08.640]  fascist system and I'm gonna have Joel walk through all of that but it's it's
[42:08.640 --> 42:12.120]  really heating up and accelerating towards this he thinks it's five ten
[42:12.120 --> 42:17.000]  years out my only issue is this if this keeps pushing it could happen earlier
[42:17.000 --> 42:22.160]  or or if this is known just like they trick the Japanese to attack that's on
[42:22.160 --> 42:29.000]  record declassified will they trick the Chinese to attack this time and but
[42:29.000 --> 42:32.120]  everything you see in the elites is digging in and getting underground so
[42:32.120 --> 42:36.800]  Joe Scow will be with us about 25 minutes into the next hour we've got one

[47:23.760 --> 47:30.360]  the GCN radio network I want to cover the waterfront with Joel Scousen into the
[47:30.360 --> 47:36.720]  next hour I want to get into Obamacare how things are going for the globalist
[47:36.720 --> 47:41.280]  but but but getting back sir just just briefly recapping for folks that just
[47:41.280 --> 47:45.440]  joined us the three power blocks what's happening with China and then the time
[47:45.440 --> 47:50.520]  frame of this and and and then makes sense of all the DHS gearing up the
[47:50.520 --> 47:54.960]  preparation for the war with patriots obviously they're trying to start some
[47:54.960 --> 47:58.520]  type of conflict between the groups is that another one of their plans or is
[47:58.520 --> 48:03.240]  that to pre position the idea that after the collapse the enemy will be
[48:03.240 --> 48:07.720]  mopping up the Liberty Movement I mean I just see preparation for war with real
[48:07.720 --> 48:12.280]  Americans and then preparation for war with the Chinese doing everything they
[48:12.280 --> 48:18.440]  can to let them encircle us but also mess with them into attacking us
[48:18.440 --> 48:23.680]  yeah it's a complex scenario Alex you know it's there's several levels to
[48:23.680 --> 48:29.640]  analyze it as I if I could just briefly be capped here first of all since 1900
[48:29.640 --> 48:34.560]  the Western globalists have been attempting to build the two major
[48:34.560 --> 48:39.560]  enemies that will attack us someday and that is Russia and China they brought
[48:39.560 --> 48:43.320]  them to power they created them that doesn't mean that they control them
[48:43.320 --> 48:47.000]  however they've actually created independent enemies and there's no
[48:47.000 --> 48:52.080]  shortage of them around the world and no Satan is involved in inspiring evil
[48:52.080 --> 48:55.600]  men to rise up a lot of people say why can't we have peace in the world the
[48:55.600 --> 48:59.040]  reason we don't have peace is because there is systematic evil in the world
[48:59.040 --> 49:04.680]  that will always continue to rise up but we are having to deal with systematic
[49:04.680 --> 49:09.120]  evil within our own government but I call the dark side of government it has
[49:09.120 --> 49:14.520]  built Russia and China to basically tear down the fabric of the West and other
[49:14.520 --> 49:17.800]  liberty countries around the world letting the globalists come in with an
[49:17.800 --> 49:21.800]  alternative solution to save them from communists but ultimately not
[49:21.800 --> 49:27.520]  destroying communism reserving for them the last final attack upon America which
[49:27.520 --> 49:32.320]  I think is coming in in that probably eight years at the earliest maybe ten
[49:32.320 --> 49:37.120]  years but clearly into the next decade because Russian China aren't ready to
[49:37.120 --> 49:41.640]  attack the West the entire political theater about China wouldn't bear
[49:41.640 --> 49:45.720]  attack is because will their lifeblood of commerce isn't true at all China in
[49:45.720 --> 49:51.520]  fact it tends to take over the West run its own new world order imposes dictates
[49:51.520 --> 49:56.040]  upon us and actually own the markets not be hostage to the Western markets but
[49:56.040 --> 50:01.760]  own the markets in order to do that they have to take out US military power but
[50:01.760 --> 50:07.400]  one of the interesting things they intend to do is not attack civilian cities
[50:07.400 --> 50:11.160]  and this runs counter to what has been revealed or allowed to be leaked by the
[50:11.160 --> 50:17.160]  official China news agency about the attack plans on America showing attacking
[50:17.160 --> 50:21.960]  major cities in the east and seeing that fallout rise into the West into the
[50:21.960 --> 50:29.200]  East but really that's for blackmail purposes Alex in other words the threat
[50:29.200 --> 50:34.680]  of attacking city has been used for blackmail to scare them into compliance
[50:34.680 --> 50:40.960]  or to there's a variety purposes prior to war but I happen to know that the
[50:40.960 --> 50:46.480]  Chinese and Russian military plans do not call for attacking civilian
[50:46.480 --> 50:51.480]  population centers but only military centers and then saying to the West now
[50:51.480 --> 50:58.960]  if you want the rest of it you know then I suggest that you or you need to succumb
[50:58.960 --> 51:02.760]  to our level of control in other words they want to blackmail the West into
[51:02.760 --> 51:07.240]  submission well the West knows about these plans they know that there'll be a
[51:07.240 --> 51:15.240]  military decapitating strike on America someday and but they intend to to
[51:15.240 --> 51:20.680]  deceive the Russians and Chinese thinking we think you know we can blackmail us
[51:20.680 --> 51:24.800]  into submission by not submitting to that blackmail they'll in fact pull out an
[51:24.800 --> 51:32.600]  entire group of secret weapons that they've been building and prosecute the
[51:32.600 --> 51:35.640]  war but they won't do it in the name of the United States they'll do it in the
[51:35.640 --> 51:40.640]  name of this new militarized globalist government that they'll talk us into the
[51:40.640 --> 51:46.880]  necessity of terms of prosecuting this war so it's important to be able to
[51:46.880 --> 51:52.360]  understand what's going on another thing that I want to point out is that the
[51:52.360 --> 51:56.600]  United States is focusing on China as the threat it's very interesting that
[51:56.600 --> 52:01.520]  they completely negate the Russian threat which is even greater than the
[52:01.520 --> 52:06.280]  Chinese threat in terms of the missile throw capability what I think China and
[52:06.280 --> 52:10.600]  Russia are cooking up in this next war is that China is going to Russia is going
[52:10.600 --> 52:14.600]  to take the lead in the nuclear attack on America they've got the most
[52:14.600 --> 52:18.400]  sophisticated weapons they've got maneuvering warheads now at least they
[52:18.400 --> 52:24.240]  claim that they do they're building and China is going to be supplied pardon me
[52:24.240 --> 52:31.360]  will China be supply well not just supply but China is going to take up the
[52:31.360 --> 52:35.480]  entire Far East they're going to capture in a grudge match everything from
[52:35.480 --> 52:41.840]  Japan down through Australia and they're going to supposedly be the back door but
[52:41.840 --> 52:45.640]  essentially they're going to husband their missiles or keep their missiles in
[52:45.640 --> 52:50.960]  reserve because they basically want to take Russia down in a betrayal in World
[52:50.960 --> 52:56.240]  War three and so Russia's going to use up most of their weapons in the first
[52:56.240 --> 53:02.240]  strike on America depending on China to back them up if more are necessary but
[53:02.240 --> 53:07.160]  I think China is going to betray Russia in this war join forces for the West to
[53:07.160 --> 53:11.880]  attack Russia's rear Russia will be eliminated as one of the three predator
[53:11.880 --> 53:17.200]  powers and then it's going to be the globalist in the West against China as
[53:17.200 --> 53:21.240]  the new Cold War enemy well it's a very important strategy that even the
[53:21.240 --> 53:26.440]  globalist want because if China is a new hegemonic threat and highly
[53:26.440 --> 53:31.520]  militarized after World War three the globalist have the excuse now to keep
[53:31.520 --> 53:36.960]  the world military in power and not let sovereign people back to individual
[53:36.960 --> 53:41.280]  nations that they did during World War two and that's where I think we're going
[53:41.280 --> 53:45.760]  to lose our freedom you talked about what all this preparation is towards
[53:45.760 --> 53:50.520]  martial law and through ammunition and all of the total surveillance system I
[53:50.520 --> 53:55.240]  think frankly that it doesn't come into being or into practice even though
[53:55.240 --> 53:59.040]  they're preparing for it that militarizing the police that practically
[53:59.040 --> 54:03.480]  giving away armored vehicles around the nation and making sure that you hire
[54:03.480 --> 54:08.760]  people both in the military and in civilian police that will be able to
[54:08.760 --> 54:12.680]  take on America don't have any compunction against taking on American
[54:12.680 --> 54:18.320]  citizens but that militarization I think will only go into full force once this
[54:18.320 --> 54:22.920]  war comes when they'll have the excuse to implement martial law and nobody will
[54:22.920 --> 54:27.920]  be raised a finger of opposition because we're in a war scenario I think what
[54:27.920 --> 54:33.920]  we'll see as part of the new world order is an oath of allegiance to the new
[54:33.920 --> 54:37.320]  world order and our government will come out and say there are people in the
[54:37.320 --> 54:41.480]  United States who follow Joel Scowze and Alex Jones and other people like that
[54:41.480 --> 54:46.120]  who are believe that we knew about this war that we didn't protect America that
[54:46.120 --> 54:50.680]  we caused 9-11 those people aren't supporting our troops they're undermining
[54:50.680 --> 54:55.360]  our war effort we need to lock them up and to ferret them out we're gonna have
[54:55.360 --> 54:59.720]  an oath of allegiance no one will have any citizenship in this nation and in
[54:59.720 --> 55:04.080]  this world government unless they take the oath of allegiance and they'll ask
[55:04.080 --> 55:09.240]  Americans to point the finger at those that believe in conspiracy and I think
[55:09.240 --> 55:13.160]  that's when the camps will be implemented I think that's when martial law and
[55:13.160 --> 55:17.800]  that's when gun confiscation will go forth let me ask you a quick question
[55:17.800 --> 55:21.000]  Joel Scowze is our guest we're listening to the Alex Jones show his sites
[55:21.000 --> 55:26.920]  world affairs brief.com our sites info wars.com Joel let me ask you this point
[55:26.920 --> 55:32.120]  everything I see is is is racing towards demonization of the founders gun
[55:32.120 --> 55:38.360]  owners everything the persecution of the press it's intensifying but but what
[55:38.360 --> 55:40.960]  adds a lot of validity and I'm trying to pull the articles up right now I forgot
[55:40.960 --> 55:44.760]  to do it before the show it was in the mid 60s and again in the 70s because I
[55:44.760 --> 55:48.640]  know the British declassified it last year but I had seen this on PBS when I
[55:48.640 --> 55:54.160]  was like a kid it had come out that that twice the Russians came to the US and
[55:54.160 --> 56:01.440]  said let's make a pact let's nuke China together and that the US each time said
[56:01.440 --> 56:05.280]  no we're not gonna nuke China with you and that was part of the next deal when
[56:05.280 --> 56:09.320]  Nixon went to Russia I know you were a Marine Corps officer and also have a
[56:09.320 --> 56:13.040]  lot of inside connections but you also researched the history is there truth to
[56:13.040 --> 56:19.320]  those supposed British declassifications no I don't think so Alex there was
[56:19.320 --> 56:24.720]  never any pact between the Russians and the Chinese I mean the Russians and the
[56:24.720 --> 56:28.400]  Americans to go after the Chinese the Chinese wouldn't even have counted that
[56:28.400 --> 56:32.840]  because they were busy trying to give everything they could to China that's
[56:32.840 --> 56:37.720]  what happened during the Vietnam War the truth sure that Paris was to in fact
[56:37.720 --> 56:42.960]  replace China the UN Security Council from Taiwan so why did the British put
[56:42.960 --> 56:48.920]  out stuff like that well as I say we have to be careful there's an awful lot of
[56:48.920 --> 56:53.840]  disinformation that floats around I just have never found any confirmation that
[56:53.840 --> 56:59.160]  that deal was made or frankly I would like to see the material when you come
[56:59.160 --> 57:03.840]  out with it sure I'm just going from memory about I think it was a London
[57:03.840 --> 57:07.920]  telegraph last time I saw just a side issue I remember reading about it
[57:07.920 --> 57:13.280]  previously Joel Scousins our guest second hour is coming up Joel I know you've
[57:13.280 --> 57:15.800]  got some more to say on this topic I want to shift gears into the current
[57:15.800 --> 57:19.560]  politics because I really see a big awakening happening and I don't think
[57:19.560 --> 57:22.800]  it's a foregone conclusion that we've just got to give in a total tyranny I
[57:22.800 --> 57:26.360]  know you don't think that as well so I want to get your idea on politically this
[57:26.360 --> 57:31.760]  is a football game where the scoreboard is right now Liberty versus tyranny
[57:31.760 --> 57:36.200]  Joel Scousins our guest I'm Alex Jones and again our sites are info wars.com

[57:49.320 --> 57:53.880]  I had tried everything I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating I was
[57:53.880 --> 57:57.960]  lifting weights and jogging but nothing was working my body was literally
[57:57.960 --> 58:02.400]  starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins and as soon as I
[58:02.400 --> 58:07.320]  had that I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be
[58:07.320 --> 58:11.760]  satisfied now there are hundreds of great products at info wars.com but I
[58:11.760 --> 58:18.400]  want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two
[58:18.400 --> 58:24.320]  months products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, pollen burst and rebound when
[58:24.320 --> 58:28.240]  I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day I lost more than
[58:28.240 --> 58:33.680]  37 pounds in just two months now that's results I want to challenge my listeners

[59:00.200 --> 59:04.320]  nuclear testing and radiological accidents radioactive contamination is
[59:04.320 --> 59:08.520]  now in most of the food supply there's only two ways to avoid this move south

[59:47.160 --> 59:55.160]  that's infowarslife.com coast to coast direct from Austin you're listening to
[59:55.160 --> 01:00:02.880]  the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network network from his central Texas command
[01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:08.360]  center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues it's Alex
[01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:12.960]  Jones and the GCN radio network
[01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:17.600]  all right I was just searching and I found the Los Angeles Times but this is
[01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:20.520]  the opposite of what the London Telegraph said about memory serves right
[01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:25.520]  and I kind of get diverted off into factoids sometimes it says US
[01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:30.280]  considered 64 bombing to keep China nuclear-free approach the Soviet Union
[01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:34.720]  to get a deal and the Soviets weren't interested and that was from
[01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:41.360]  McGeorge Bundy so that's in memos declassified that's in 1998 the Brits and
[01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:44.600]  I'm going from memory office last year they said the opposite and I know I read
[01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:48.960]  that but but you get yeah just sounds like pure bull because as the John
[01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:55.200]  Burt's high and others exposed back in the 60s it wasn't just the Russians
[01:00:55.200 --> 01:01:01.760]  arming the the Chinese and they were arming the north Vietnam Joel there's a
[01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:06.320]  lot of evidence that a lot of US companies Armand Hammer and others they
[01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:09.760]  were busy also helping the Russians so they could help China and then help
[01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:17.080]  Vietnam correct absolutely Alex they were in there and then of course
[01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:22.080]  recently in the past decade they've used Israel as the main conduit to arm
[01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:27.840]  China most of our technology goes to Israel is being allowed to be sold by
[01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:32.920]  Israel to China both as a factor way to get more wealth into China and to
[01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:38.480]  transfer technology to China so that the US can't be blamed for it but we're
[01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:43.400]  behind it and it's happening and we've given them Boeing so now they're coming
[01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:48.240]  out with you with stuff that looks better in our B-52 we've got planes from
[01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:54.200]  the 50s and they've got brand new stuff I mean this really is scary well it is
[01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:59.920]  China is actually probably going to outproduce Russia in terms of
[01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:04.640]  conventional arms in preparation for World War three that's what makes me
[01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:09.680]  believe that Russia is going to be the primary missile attack force they've
[01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:13.960]  still got a lot of 80s and 90s technology conventional weapons but a lot of
[01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:18.480]  their conventional weapons are industry pair don't have enough submarines or
[01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:23.760]  a blue water Navy even compared to China now which was out producing anyone in
[01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:27.760]  the world in terms of naval power it within ten years it's going to be a
[01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:32.480]  formidable naval power and a lot of people ask me well if they're going to
[01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:36.480]  use nuclear weapons to take out our carrier task groups why are they building
[01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:40.880]  our aircraft carriers and my answer is they intend to take out our task force
[01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:45.200]  and our US unfortunately it's going to allow those task force to be
[01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:49.960]  decapitated and that's when China will bring out their aircraft carriers into
[01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:53.760]  kind of a nuclear free zone where they'll be free to maneuver them in the
[01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:58.680]  aftermath of nuclear first strike and again the top oh this is what I wanted
[01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:02.800]  to ask you about we come back as a short segment the the the purge that's going
[01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:06.720]  on is definitely going on the litmus test lower levels will you take guns but
[01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:10.600]  higher level it's will you you know put women in frontline combat and have you
[01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:14.240]  know just all this stuff to wreck the military I mean it's just there's no
[01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:18.320]  other thing that I could say coming out of all this that they do want to wreck
[01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:23.840]  the military make us look weak and then elicit this attack as you've said well
[01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:27.800]  they certainly have put a lot of yes man at the top I mean the whole story
[01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:32.080]  about the Chinese being invited in to take part in this exercise in Hawaii it's
[01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:36.160]  just treasonous it is a military exercise they're being allowed on our
[01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:40.520]  military destroyers in our submarines and even though these are general
[01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:44.160]  officers doing the tours they've got eyes wide open trying to figure out
[01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:48.960]  everything they can from what we're we're doing in our military and they
[01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:53.960]  don't want from military communications and protocols during these drills so
[01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:59.280]  even though there are elements within the military who are very patriotic and
[01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:03.960]  who in fact do see China and Russia as the threat they're trying their best to
[01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:09.440]  prepare against that the yes men at the very top are globalists they get that
[01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:15.400]  kind of indoctrination that the table and army war colleges through globalist
[01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:19.680]  ran corporation in Georgetown University there professors at these things and
[01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:24.280]  they come out and their whole purpose after they put out their yearly report
[01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:28.880]  about Chinese military threat is to say now the answer to this of course that
[01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:32.520]  more military exercise but China to show them that we're a friend that we bend
[01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:37.400]  over backwards just they continue to seek to disarm them more ports more
[01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:40.640]  everything we've got to go to break Joe we've got to go to break we're gonna come
[01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:45.040]  right back in one minute and continue where you left off and talk about some

[01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:18.560]  always been my belief that it's key to stand behind companies who share the

[01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:29.600]  than anyone else we don't Hitler took the guns Stalin took the guns Mao took
[01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:36.440]  the guns that El Castro took the guns you though Chavez took the guns 1776 will
[01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:42.600]  commence again if you try to take our firearms the Republic will rise again
[01:06:42.600 --> 01:07:04.040]  when you attempt to take our guns the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening
[01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:11.160]  to the Alex Jones show see people all over the place online they even have
[01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:17.640]  like big factoids size that say what does the answer to 1984 is 1776 what does
[01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:23.240]  that mean it's so elementary 1984 is the big brother globalist socialist
[01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:29.040]  Thabian tyranny a boot stomping on the human face forever 1776 is the answer
[01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:34.920]  to that a waking of liberty a standing for righteousness a standing for justice
[01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:42.560]  a standing for good against evil that's what the answer to 1984 is 1776
[01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:49.560]  means very elementary and Joel Scalzen is our guest he is the editor and heads up
[01:07:49.560 --> 01:07:54.120]  world affairs brief calm we made a presentation film that's available on
[01:07:54.120 --> 01:08:00.960]  DVD at info or store.com called strategic relocation and it gets into the
[01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:05.600]  entire world the safest country subregions unlike any other research
[01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:09.160]  out there other top researchers and survivalists like James Wesley Rawls
[01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:12.920]  and others have said this really is a powerful film and powerful book of his
[01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:18.160]  that's based on that we also sell this is essential reading essential viewing
[01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:22.080]  both of them available well exclusively with the film I produced it in
[01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:31.200]  for store.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139 and I clearly clearly what
[01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:33.560]  Joel Scalzen says is right all the evidence is overwhelming when you
[01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:37.080]  immerse yourself in it this is their main plan doesn't mean they don't have
[01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:41.160]  subplans and alternate plans but they're doing everything they can here's the
[01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:45.080]  Panama Canal here's all our missile secrets here's our bomber secrets here
[01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:52.680]  come have a drill a disaster drill in our secret facilities and in Hawaii while
[01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:57.440]  the communist Chinese train to take down America and tell Hollywood they can't
[01:08:57.440 --> 01:09:01.840]  have any movies critical of communist China or their leaders I mean they
[01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:06.280]  literally have their fingers in everything manipulating internally our
[01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:11.320]  politics and the globalists are just on the surface selling out so Joel I knew
[01:09:11.320 --> 01:09:14.400]  a lot of people that works in the Star Wars program like physicists Dr. Bob
[01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:20.000]  Bowman and former fighter bomber pilot like yourself himself in Vietnam and he
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.440]  said look I can only tell you what they've accidentally leaked here and
[01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:26.720]  there because when I was in the secret space-based weapons program they had
[01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:32.360]  these projectiles meteor guns that fire D you save us that can kill people in a
[01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:38.320]  mile under the ground a decapitation weapon drones robotic systems I mean he
[01:09:38.320 --> 01:09:43.560]  said it was he said it was massive in the late 70s early 80s before he left and
[01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:48.000]  obviously there's been a lot of stuff going on it's huge as you've documented
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:51.240]  our government spent more underground bases and COG than all the other
[01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:54.640]  governments combined so when you talk about how they want to elicit this
[01:09:54.640 --> 01:10:00.960]  attack to then have NATO the US and Britain really bring in this total
[01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:06.440]  hyper fascist whatever you want to call it New World Order takeover by by
[01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:12.080]  tricking Russia and China into this strike I mean you're talking about it
[01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:16.280]  I'm talking about it how will they get away with it and from your sources and
[01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:19.600]  of course a lot of this is leaked now the black manna all this stuff a different
[01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:24.120]  space planes they've got what are the secret weapons that they intend to after
[01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:29.400]  we take the first strike roll out against them well the primary secret
[01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:34.400]  weapons is as you alluded to is Star Wars base-based anti-missile systems
[01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:39.800]  are already deployed and operational now they will not use these to defend
[01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:45.440]  America which they could do so but they won't I think PDD 60 is very very clear
[01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:51.800]  that they're going to take in the first strike from the Russians and Chinese to
[01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:56.000]  decapitate our military that's why I don't recommend even as a patriotic
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:59.840]  former military officer that anybody be in the military in the future if not
[01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:04.760]  defending America you're working unknowingly you know under a globalist
[01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:08.600]  agenda that's what all of the foreign wars are to produce the image of the
[01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:13.080]  bully of the world which were quickly gaining the ugly America again which
[01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:17.240]  will help justify Russian Chinese attacking but the important thing to
[01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:22.080]  remember is that we will not defend America now you know when I talk to
[01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:26.240]  people in the Air Force and the missiles that command the strategic command they
[01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:30.680]  say yeah we still practice for launch on warning that will defend against a
[01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:34.480]  nuclear first strike I'm explained to your audience that new people what
[01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:40.200]  launch on warning is all about we have fixed missile systems here on earth you
[01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:43.920]  don't discount if you discount you know what I'm talking about the space-based
[01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:47.920]  weapons but fixed missile system we have no mobile missiles the Russians and the
[01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:53.000]  Chinese have every one of those missile silos targeted they have big strong
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:58.240]  concrete doors but they cannot take a direct hit from a nuclear weapon they'll
[01:11:58.240 --> 01:12:03.320]  be taken out so launch on warning means that when we detected their missiles
[01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:10.120]  launching we get our missiles out of our silos already and and so that when
[01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:14.400]  they're incoming missiles which can't change course get those silos they're
[01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:19.880]  already empty now if you wait until you absorb a nuclear first strike those
[01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:24.640]  missiles are all gone but in launch on warning the one who launches second
[01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:29.560]  actually does the most damage because they're retargeted as they're going up
[01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:34.800]  into the air and they hit launch sites that have not been used yet and they go
[01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:39.560]  after Russian and Chinese sites and targets that are still active whereas
[01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:43.720]  their missiles the first strike missiles come into empty targets now that's
[01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:48.640]  time I'm missile silos the missiles that they send to our military bases will
[01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:53.280]  have devastating impact but I believe what's going to happen is that our
[01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:58.240]  military missile forces will not get the launch codes from the White House you
[01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:02.640]  know it takes a special codes from the White House to be able to activate the
[01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:06.880]  codes that are had at Cheyenne Mountain and other places in the missile bases
[01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:09.520]  and I just don't think they're going to get them they're going to say hey come
[01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:13.760]  on the missiles are coming and where are the codes technical communications can't
[01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:17.920]  get them to you we're working on it and we'll absorb a nuclear first strike and
[01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:22.280]  it's going to be treasonous it's going to be evil but our government is going to
[01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:25.440]  come out of their bunkers deep underground bunkers you know they're not
[01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:28.920]  building those bunkers because of terrorist attacks they're building those
[01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:32.880]  bunkers because they know a nuclear first strike is coming to America and
[01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:36.640]  they intend to survive it that's part of my motivation so that's what the
[01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:40.280]  Homeland Security cover is is not even with the fight with the Patriots that's
[01:13:40.280 --> 01:13:44.720]  just the political cover it's open if you look at the Intel it's openly a
[01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:50.720]  hardening to shelter in place during the nuclear war and then re-emerge with the
[01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:55.720]  high-tech weapons systems which is the Rand Corporation plan that's right and
[01:13:55.720 --> 01:13:59.040]  I think from that point on when they come out of their bunkers and they
[01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:02.880]  decide to fight this war and everybody says with what in the first place those
[01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:06.480]  space-based weapons are going to keep any other missiles from coming in so we
[01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:11.240]  will be able to start rebuilding and reorganizing military forces I think
[01:14:11.240 --> 01:14:14.680]  the Russians and Chinese after the first strike are going to try to blackmail the
[01:14:14.680 --> 01:14:18.320]  West into submission our leaders will come out of the bunkers and say don't
[01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:22.920]  give into this let's fight and that's when they'll start to bring out these
[01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:26.120]  highly weaponized systems that they could have used to defend and it's a
[01:14:26.120 --> 01:14:30.380]  perfect plan because after we've seen 50 million people killed most the
[01:14:30.380 --> 01:14:33.800]  military wiped out the carriers destroyed it won't matter people will be
[01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:38.720]  howling for murder and and and it will be if then World War three really gets
[01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:45.440]  going then because now it's it's going to be on and anybody the crisis is that
[01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:49.420]  will be hung immediately I mean it'll be a death sentence it's trying to say
[01:14:49.420 --> 01:14:53.120]  we've just been nuked hey this is all a setup don't do it you know we predicted
[01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:56.280]  it no it'll be you've got to get behind the New World Order now you've got a
[01:14:56.280 --> 01:15:00.040]  swear allegiance to Europe and Britain who are going to aid us with the UN
[01:15:00.040 --> 01:15:06.120]  they're all going to stand with us now against the dirty commies and that's
[01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:11.320]  why politically Alex it's so important that they co-opt the American Republican
[01:15:11.320 --> 01:15:15.320]  Party and the ostensible conservatives and that's what they're doing they're
[01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:19.960]  setting up what we saw last week with the with a sabotage of the Cuccinelli

[01:19:14.120 --> 01:19:18.800]  massive nuclear attack is coming they want that attack to come. Joel Scowzen is
[01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:23.120]  renowned as one of the world's foremost experts in strategic relocation and the
[01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:27.560]  securing of your home. What I tell people is that you do have time we talk
[01:19:27.560 --> 01:19:31.240]  about natural disasters the health environment we talk about pollution the
[01:19:31.240 --> 01:19:35.000]  water quality my personal experience about being in every one of these states
[01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:38.520]  most people won't even be ready won't be able to get out of town because they'll
[01:19:38.520 --> 01:19:42.840]  be absolute panic. There is no preparedness without strategy this

[01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:06.120]  Coast to coast direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones
[01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:17.280]  Broadcasting Network. We are on the march the Empire is on the run Alex Jones and
[01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:28.600]  the GCN radio network. I'm waiting as I watch our entire bill of rights and
[01:20:28.600 --> 01:20:33.960]  Constitution dismantled but Joel Scowzen the more I learned is just so on
[01:20:33.960 --> 01:20:38.360]  target about his entire breakdown of this and there's all this surface stuff
[01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:43.880]  going on and then even deeper tides and currents but at the bottom of this the
[01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:48.960]  globalists have always understood that they have to create giant wars to bring
[01:20:48.960 --> 01:20:53.000]  in their world government to carry out their eugenics policies and to reduce
[01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:57.840]  population and by accepting the strike they will kill American culture forever
[01:20:57.840 --> 01:21:02.320]  the police state will be waiting in the wings it will roll in I just wondered
[01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:05.080]  Joel Scowzen I want to talk about how they want to destroy the libertarian
[01:21:05.080 --> 01:21:09.680]  movement the patriot movement the constitutional movement in the
[01:21:09.680 --> 01:21:15.880]  Republican Party but but but you can see the preparations for this and then
[01:21:15.880 --> 01:21:20.680]  it leaks from Biden it leaks from the Republican leadership Carl Rove all of
[01:21:20.680 --> 01:21:25.760]  them people like Senator McCain the number one mission with Democrats and
[01:21:25.760 --> 01:21:30.680]  Republicans meeting and councils is destroy Rand Paul destroy Ted Cruz
[01:21:30.680 --> 01:21:35.600]  destroy the liberty movement destroy the John Burt society type folks that
[01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:39.760]  we've been right for 60 years and people like your uncle Cleon Scowzen God
[01:21:39.760 --> 01:21:43.400]  bless them who's been proven absolutely right destroy those of us that are real
[01:21:43.400 --> 01:21:48.160]  patriots who want to have a free country into the future and and and who
[01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:53.600]  literally we're carrying the torch for those that created this nation 1776 that
[01:21:53.600 --> 01:21:58.080]  is anathema to this world government plan we want a system of liberty
[01:21:58.080 --> 01:22:02.200]  worldwide they want the devilish counterfeit of tyranny worldwide using
[01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:06.520]  the seeds of our republic to do it and you see them pushing the anti-gun
[01:22:06.520 --> 01:22:12.360]  traitor Chris Christie pushing but but doing everything they can with fake
[01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:16.280]  scandals to decapitate the liberty movement so talk about that and talk
[01:22:16.280 --> 01:22:19.760]  about where we are in this fight because if they're so scared of the real tea
[01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:24.480]  party and demonizing myself with the incredible unprecedented demonization
[01:22:24.480 --> 01:22:28.280]  demonizing you and others it shows as the old fighter bombers know you're
[01:22:28.280 --> 01:22:32.600]  over the target when you're getting the flak well the worst thing that they
[01:22:32.600 --> 01:22:37.960]  fear is another Ron Paul surfacing that's why they fear Ted Cruz Mike Lee
[01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:44.400]  and Kuchinelli who just lit a fire under people for real change nobody gives us
[01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:49.120]  real change from the establishment Republican way it's always Obama a and
[01:22:49.120 --> 01:22:54.720]  BT but they fear another Ron Paul Ron Paul doubled the size of the liberty
[01:22:54.720 --> 01:23:03.440]  movement single-handedly because he was able to maneuver you know by appealing
[01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:08.920]  to both you know principle liberals independence libertarians conservatives
[01:23:08.920 --> 01:23:14.240]  Christians he was able to pull in all of them that really a fake afraid that the
[01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:18.400]  tea party generally is relatively uneducated it runs all over the map
[01:23:18.400 --> 01:23:24.160]  from semi-conservative to even mainstream conservatives who you know like
[01:23:24.160 --> 01:23:28.600]  some of the issues of the tea party but they're afraid of the education that is
[01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:31.680]  someone like Ron Paul is capable to bring it they're afraid of what Alex
[01:23:31.680 --> 01:23:37.800]  Jones has done in building a million multi-million base of people who really
[01:23:37.800 --> 01:23:41.600]  understand conspiracy now Ron Paul wouldn't touch conspiracy because he
[01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:46.000]  felt like it would destroy him politically but what he did was prepare
[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:49.840]  the way so that people would listen to you people would listen to me who aren't
[01:23:49.840 --> 01:23:55.120]  afraid to talk about the conspiracy issues in a credible way and so that's
[01:23:55.120 --> 01:24:00.920]  why they have to go out and destroy anybody who's on that dividing line
[01:24:00.920 --> 01:24:05.640]  between mainstream Republicans and is capable of pulling them over into the
[01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:10.640]  real understanding conspiracy and the constitutionalism which must much save
[01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:16.800]  us and that ran Paul was it's semi in that that juncture that can bring people
[01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:21.880]  one way or the other so is Ted Cruz so is Mike Lee and so was Cuccinelli now
[01:24:21.880 --> 01:24:25.920]  what they wanted to do was do the Mitt Romney thing on it you know Mitt Romney
[01:24:25.920 --> 01:24:30.800]  wasn't one of us and Mitt Romney by the way a week ago today came out all but
[01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:36.040]  endorsed Chris Christie so hungry is he to get back into the establishment they
[01:24:36.040 --> 01:24:40.600]  won't let him run for president anymore but he's hungry to get a cabinet
[01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:44.400]  position under someone like Chris Christie and so he came out and supported
[01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:50.080]  it but even someone like Mitt Romney wasn't an insider but was bending over
[01:24:50.080 --> 01:24:54.600]  backwards to please them they didn't want because you can't have anybody in the
[01:24:54.600 --> 01:25:00.220]  presidency who isn't part of the corrupt system they might see something even if
[01:25:00.220 --> 01:25:03.800]  Mitt Romney were in there had they elected he would not probably have gone
[01:25:03.800 --> 01:25:08.120]  along with a stand down or in Benghazi they would have had to control him like
[01:25:08.120 --> 01:25:12.080]  it did Ronald Reagan with an assassination attempt so they want puppets
[01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:16.680]  and I'll tell you that Chris Christie is somebody who's locked into their system
[01:25:16.680 --> 01:25:21.200]  he is a globalist pretending to be a conservative but it looks like they're
[01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:26.680]  going to promote him for president 2016 probably throw Marco Rubio or Jeff Bush
[01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:31.320]  as the vice president but this is going to be very very dangerous they are
[01:25:31.320 --> 01:25:36.200]  breeding the conservatives to basically be knee jerk patriotic pro-war pro
[01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:41.680]  military support our true conservatives and that's why the neocon movement was
[01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:46.720]  so important to the establishment that is to take liberals and have them turn
[01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:51.160]  into conservatives ostensibly at least in terms of foreign policy you know they
[01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:55.920]  still maintain that liberal abuse sure Trotskyites that's beyond liberal young
[01:25:55.920 --> 01:26:00.760]  yes they were Trotskyites and they have paraded themselves conserved I saw the
[01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:05.040]  Alley North on television on Fox television you know talking about his
[01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:09.720]  great patriot I mean Alley North is on the dark side yeah he's on the
[01:26:09.720 --> 01:26:14.520]  conservative dark side but still the dark side he is defending government war
[01:26:14.520 --> 01:26:19.480]  monitoring and always will he was defending NSA spying and nobody on the
[01:26:19.480 --> 01:26:24.440]  right side of this world defends this kind of Orwellian
[01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:28.480]  sure Joe we're out of time let me ask you this and any time you want to come
[01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:32.440]  to Austin live to have you in studio there's so much talk about in closing
[01:26:32.440 --> 01:26:36.560]  though I mean we are starting to gain some ground we do have a chance people
[01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:40.200]  are really listening even people in the power structure are now looking at their
[01:26:40.200 --> 01:26:44.600]  children realizing this new world order is a very dark place to go and it's time
[01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:48.160]  for everybody to realize what you're hearing is the truth you better choose
[01:26:48.160 --> 01:26:54.720]  the right side because going down this road is hellish final comments well
[01:26:54.720 --> 01:26:59.240]  final comment is your right Alex our side is gaining strength their side is
[01:26:59.240 --> 01:27:03.880]  also gaining strength those two sides are polarizing and hardening there's
[01:27:03.880 --> 01:27:07.480]  hardly any movement even with all the death and destruction and gun control
[01:27:07.480 --> 01:27:12.160]  there's no movement between the pro-gun side and the anti-gun side and that
[01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:16.040]  means war is the only thing they're going to be able to throw at us to change
[01:27:16.040 --> 01:27:20.120]  American society and not going to be able to do it the slow way as they have
[01:27:20.120 --> 01:27:24.320]  been doing it through these propaganda techniques that's right Hitler was evil
[01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:28.320]  the Japanese imperial system was evil but our government helped build up both
[01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:32.760]  groups along with the British model so that they could use World War two to
[01:27:32.760 --> 01:27:36.600]  bring in big government finally get Americans to accept it look what they
[01:27:36.600 --> 01:27:40.600]  did to our culture after World War two well imagine another big one like that
[01:27:40.600 --> 01:27:46.920]  they'll be able to do anything they want and liberty will die at this next
[01:27:46.920 --> 01:27:50.680]  war and they won't give it back as they did in World War two so don't expect it
[01:27:50.680 --> 01:27:54.240]  to turn out the same all right Joel Scowles and World Affairs brief calm

[01:30:58.920 --> 01:31:04.560]  a little over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a
[01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:08.320]  pretty good-sized meal that I was still starving and my research led me to a
[01:31:08.320 --> 01:31:12.400]  well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the
[01:31:12.400 --> 01:31:15.840]  United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely
[01:31:15.840 --> 01:31:20.600]  depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our
[01:31:20.600 --> 01:31:25.080]  bodies need to rebuild themselves fight off cancer and be healthy. I then
[01:31:25.080 --> 01:31:29.880]  searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered

[01:33:12.040 --> 01:33:18.160]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones on the
[01:33:18.160 --> 01:33:34.160]  GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:34.160 --> 01:33:39.400]  Ladies and gentlemen I wanted to talk about solutions today. I first heard
[01:33:39.400 --> 01:33:46.600]  about smart meters in about 1998 when Enron was out promoting them and it came
[01:33:46.600 --> 01:33:49.640]  out their internal documents. They were going to tax you more. They were going to
[01:33:49.640 --> 01:33:52.480]  be able to control the thermostat in your house and they were working with
[01:33:52.480 --> 01:33:58.000]  other industries worldwide to have chips and microphones and cameras in your
[01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:01.720]  dishwashers your computers to track everything you're doing. Steal the data
[01:34:01.720 --> 01:34:06.080]  and then sell the data. Well now you know about Google cars driving around
[01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:09.480]  admittedly stealing your passwords, jacking all your info and they don't
[01:34:09.480 --> 01:34:13.880]  get in trouble and they've got Google barges off the coast doing it and then
[01:34:13.880 --> 01:34:17.000]  it turns out Google's involved with the NSA and you've got Homeland Security
[01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:21.440]  giving tens of billions a year to put in gunshot detectors which they've now
[01:34:21.440 --> 01:34:24.880]  come out in mainstream news and admitted you know what their microphones were
[01:34:24.880 --> 01:34:31.080]  listening to you with voice print. So it's a total surveillance system not to
[01:34:31.080 --> 01:34:35.360]  stop terrorism but to track the American people and just like it came out in the
[01:34:35.360 --> 01:34:39.720]  news today that the NSA was and the British intelligence agencies were
[01:34:39.720 --> 01:34:44.560]  spying on citizens in Europe, England and other places that were trying to get
[01:34:44.560 --> 01:34:48.800]  their money back when big banks had stolen it to persecute the citizens. See
[01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:53.120]  it's intel for the big corporations to basically screw everybody. So they put
[01:34:53.120 --> 01:34:56.000]  this on your house, it has health effects that have come out on record, it's
[01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:01.440]  dialing into everything, stealing data, I mean that's what these do and Enron came
[01:35:01.440 --> 01:35:07.120]  up with this. So Dr. Laura Presley been a great activist, she's a chemistry
[01:35:07.120 --> 01:35:11.520]  graduate PhD and she's been for many years I've known her fighting the toxic
[01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:14.480]  fluoridation in the water which is now Harvard admits is deadly and giving you
[01:35:14.480 --> 01:35:18.200]  cancer and she's helped head up with others when I give folks the group which
[01:35:18.200 --> 01:35:25.080]  is a great example for a group in your area so that you can get an opt out and
[01:35:25.080 --> 01:35:28.080]  they say you know pay ten dollars a month more whatever. The point is the smart
[01:35:28.080 --> 01:35:32.760]  meters in every city it's come out. Your bill goes up folks so they absolutely
[01:35:32.760 --> 01:35:36.280]  use these to play all sorts of shenanigans. Look at your power prices
[01:35:36.280 --> 01:35:40.600]  going up and so she joins us now to talk about the success in Austin what the
[01:35:40.600 --> 01:35:46.320]  smart meters do and then this is a model first city in Texas to have this opt
[01:35:46.320 --> 01:35:50.680]  out. I mean we've seen Chicago where people refuse to have them the police
[01:35:50.680 --> 01:35:54.360]  come and arrest them. Upscale neighborhoods no you're not coming on my
[01:35:54.360 --> 01:35:57.960]  property you need a warrant cops arrest you. I mean we've shown those videos
[01:35:57.960 --> 01:36:01.480]  we've had those mothers on here it's mainly women fighting these and people
[01:36:01.480 --> 01:36:05.920]  they're doing studies now where people wake up when they activate it's been
[01:36:05.920 --> 01:36:08.680]  found it's like it sends the wavelength through your brain and is waking you up
[01:36:08.680 --> 01:36:12.520]  as your brain like sees it like a bright light basically. I mean these things are
[01:36:12.520 --> 01:36:17.360]  so bad folks we turned the wireless off at my house two years ago much better
[01:36:17.360 --> 01:36:22.480]  sleep everything it is definitely the cell phones brain cancer you name it the
[01:36:22.480 --> 01:36:27.040]  electronic fog there's so many issues here health surveillance so Dr. Presley
[01:36:27.040 --> 01:36:29.920]  thank you so much for coming on with us good to see you again. Well Alex thank
[01:36:29.920 --> 01:36:33.240]  you for talking about this really really important subject you know these
[01:36:33.240 --> 01:36:37.360]  smart meters are digital computers that emit radio frequency and microwave
[01:36:37.360 --> 01:36:42.480]  radiation on our homes and they communicate through our homes to these
[01:36:42.480 --> 01:36:47.200]  huge concentrators that are on the electric power lines so not only are
[01:36:47.200 --> 01:36:53.800]  they emitting you know outside of our houses the electric usage that we are
[01:36:53.800 --> 01:36:57.800]  using in our homes but they're going through our homes to communicate to
[01:36:57.800 --> 01:37:03.200]  these these wireless networks on these electric utility systems so I want to
[01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:06.960]  break down just a little bit the radio frequency energies that these things use
[01:37:06.960 --> 01:37:12.600]  think about a radio station let's say 99.7 FM that's a common station here in
[01:37:12.600 --> 01:37:22.240]  Austin Texas and that's 99.7 megahertz okay these emit 900 to 2500 megahertz
[01:37:22.240 --> 01:37:27.680]  10 to 20 times higher in radiation and energy than what these radio waves that
[01:37:27.680 --> 01:37:31.120]  we've been exposed to what and by the way any engineer will tell you don't get
[01:37:31.120 --> 01:37:35.600]  near the transmitter don't get the military used to heat up their food by
[01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:40.000]  transmitters absolutely in cold weather they would put them by the transmitter
[01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:44.240]  yes and and I want to just kind of what we have a meter that measures the
[01:37:44.240 --> 01:37:48.200]  radiation levels and I want to give you some baseline numbers and kind of give
[01:37:48.200 --> 01:37:52.160]  people a reference point of what how how intense these things are if you're in
[01:37:52.160 --> 01:37:56.280]  Wembley Texas which is out in the Hill Country the baseline radiation of these
[01:37:56.280 --> 01:38:01.520]  wavelengths is about 0.1 microwatts per meter squared point one all right Austin
[01:38:01.520 --> 01:38:06.640]  Texas and large metropolitan areas are about a baseline of four microwatts so
[01:38:06.640 --> 01:38:10.960]  that's 40 times higher than you know the Hill Country where you can still get a
[01:38:10.960 --> 01:38:15.640]  cell signal okay you can still get a cell signal out in Wembley and in Austin
[01:38:15.640 --> 01:38:22.560]  is 40 times higher these smart meters put out 75,000 microwatts okay that's how
[01:38:22.560 --> 01:38:26.720]  huge the power densities are of these meters and they pulse this is the other
[01:38:26.720 --> 01:38:32.560]  piece of this it's not just a continuous emission they pulse every 25 seconds and
[01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:37.200]  why are we needing to have our information our electric utility usage
[01:38:37.200 --> 01:38:42.960]  being emitted and well I mean remember ten years ten years ago was we're gonna
[01:38:42.960 --> 01:38:47.320]  control your meter then we got mad okay you know we're gonna control how how
[01:38:47.320 --> 01:38:51.720]  how hot your temperature is or how cold I mean this is all admitted they're
[01:38:51.720 --> 01:38:56.920]  spying on you every 25 seconds grabbing all the data as the CIA director
[01:38:56.920 --> 01:39:00.160]  remember when he said last year we're gonna use your washing machine to track
[01:39:00.160 --> 01:39:04.080]  everything you do right and you know what started me on this path my husband
[01:39:04.080 --> 01:39:08.520]  and I were having a lot of issues because of our smart meter in hindsight it
[01:39:08.520 --> 01:39:13.560]  took us about a year to figure this out so we would be in we'd be laying there
[01:39:13.560 --> 01:39:16.600]  trying to go to sleep at night and I would notice we would our legs would
[01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:21.680]  twitch just kind of kick and twitch and we were both engineers and so we would
[01:39:21.680 --> 01:39:27.120]  count the seconds between the twitching was 25 seconds this is before you even
[01:39:27.120 --> 01:39:29.920]  knew the smart meter about this before we even knew about the smart move you've
[01:39:29.920 --> 01:39:33.080]  seen the studies would like the aphids and stuff do yeah twitching when it
[01:39:33.080 --> 01:39:37.880]  fires you got it exactly and we were doing that in our bedrooms and we were
[01:39:37.880 --> 01:39:42.720]  kind of joke with each other but it got so bad that my I could feel my face kind
[01:39:42.720 --> 01:39:46.600]  of vibrate every 25 seconds so it kept getting worse and worse and we looked
[01:39:46.600 --> 01:39:50.560]  around our home and said what is what what is periodically coming on it this
[01:39:50.560 --> 01:39:53.200]  is an electrical stimulation there was no question about that that's not a
[01:39:53.200 --> 01:39:56.880]  biological time frame 25 seconds is not a biological time frame of any kind of
[01:39:56.880 --> 01:40:01.760]  process that I'm aware of so we looked and we found a meter to measure these
[01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:05.960]  pulses and we went out and measured our smart meter every 25 seconds our meter
[01:40:05.960 --> 01:40:10.520]  was pulsing we had Austin energy come out engineers come out to our house and
[01:40:10.520 --> 01:40:16.680]  we said let's turn the meter the pulsing emissions off and they did that and the
[01:40:16.680 --> 01:40:21.720]  twitching stopped root cause analysis but they've now got films and studies
[01:40:21.720 --> 01:40:25.800]  outward that it shows the bugs actually yes freak out when it's happening yes
[01:40:25.800 --> 01:40:29.360]  I've seen that I've seen video of that so we were twitching and so you know when
[01:40:29.360 --> 01:40:32.760]  they turn the radio emitter off the twitching stopped that's when we went
[01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:36.800]  to Austin energy and talk to the general manager Larry Weese of Austin energy
[01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:41.160]  Austin energy is a municipally owned utility company so the taxpayers own
[01:40:41.160 --> 01:40:46.240]  it and so we went to them and said you need to have an opt-out program more
[01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:50.880]  people are having issues not just us we showed him the radio frequency power
[01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:55.400]  emissions we showed him the twitching information and yes I have to give them
[01:40:55.400 --> 01:40:59.400]  credit they decided to be the first in Texas to do an opt-out program and you
[01:40:59.400 --> 01:41:02.640]  know because I've read about this other cities they've tried the feds and
[01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:07.000]  multinationals come after folks we need to really stand behind people that just
[01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:10.920]  did the bare minimum of decency right now they say you got to pay ten bucks to
[01:41:10.920 --> 01:41:14.440]  have us have somebody come read it that's fine we'll do that a month but it
[01:41:14.440 --> 01:41:17.880]  doesn't matter now you're not being fried and as you said we're already bathed
[01:41:17.880 --> 01:41:23.760]  in all the wireless and all the rest of it in Austin you go outside town it's
[01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:29.320]  way lower it's way lower and you know with with all these these wireless
[01:41:29.320 --> 01:41:34.240]  devices we have our phones our laptops are you know routers in our home
[01:41:34.240 --> 01:41:38.520]  routers are like I'm just really proud of you to say you know and what a role
[01:41:38.520 --> 01:41:42.680]  model you are to turn your router off at night turn all your wireless devices
[01:41:42.680 --> 01:41:46.000]  off at night you know we're complaining about the smart meters but we have some
[01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:49.560]  power ourselves and we should turn all these devices off for our families for
[01:41:49.560 --> 01:41:53.920]  our health and that is one things you know that that we really recommend now
[01:41:53.920 --> 01:41:56.960]  there are two different mechanisms that these smart meters are causing health
[01:41:56.960 --> 01:42:01.880]  problems one is the radiation okay and we said it's high frequency high energy
[01:42:01.880 --> 01:42:05.760]  radio frequency and microwave but there's another mechanism and it causes
[01:42:05.760 --> 01:42:09.760]  dirty electricity in the circuitry of your home because you have electrons
[01:42:09.760 --> 01:42:14.320]  flowing electricity in your home to get your power to all of your you know our
[01:42:14.320 --> 01:42:19.720]  different electrical devices when that pulse happens that sends a huge voltage
[01:42:19.720 --> 01:42:24.160]  spike in the electrical system of our house and that's why the causes that's
[01:42:24.160 --> 01:42:29.000]  why the windmills are so bad because that they use because they go up and down
[01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:32.280]  that's why energy companies hate them this is so bad for your equipment your
[01:42:32.280 --> 01:42:36.080]  house to have it just pulsing on and off in your house that's right so bad for
[01:42:36.080 --> 01:42:39.560]  all your electronics everybody knows you want clean power that you want a good
[01:42:39.560 --> 01:42:44.440]  clean straight flow biologically they know if it's good and clean it isn't
[01:42:44.440 --> 01:42:48.360]  that big of a deal even for your body it's the pulsing it's the up and down
[01:42:48.360 --> 01:42:52.680]  it's the stay there that Laura Presley is our guest give out the website before
[01:42:52.680 --> 01:42:55.960]  we go to break real fast for folks to find out more Austin smart meters calm
[01:42:55.960 --> 01:43:01.720]  also smart meters calm we'll be right back Alex Jones here with a very important

[01:46:10.200 --> 01:46:15.960]  and every other major disease it all comes down to one thing we are what we
[01:46:15.960 --> 01:46:21.320]  eat our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives our
[01:46:21.320 --> 01:46:26.440]  water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff all of this has been
[01:46:26.440 --> 01:46:31.240]  engineered by design we can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving
[01:46:31.240 --> 01:46:35.320]  ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs to learn more visit

[01:47:03.120 --> 01:47:09.520]  Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network network.
[01:47:09.520 --> 01:47:27.280]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones on the
[01:47:27.280 --> 01:47:33.480]  GCN radio network. Ladies and gentlemen there's a cocktail of reasons the
[01:47:33.480 --> 01:47:37.240]  cancers are up on average over 3,000 percent here in the U.S. pediatric
[01:47:37.240 --> 01:47:41.920]  cancer is up over 10,000 percent the industrialized world leads the planet
[01:47:41.920 --> 01:47:46.240]  even as toxins supposedly go down in cancers diseases and problems and
[01:47:46.240 --> 01:47:49.480]  electricity's only been harnessed I mean the ancient Greeks and others had
[01:47:49.480 --> 01:47:53.840]  primitive batteries chemical batteries but that have been dug up but in the
[01:47:53.840 --> 01:47:57.920]  last 150 years is the real birth of modern electricity where they fire high
[01:47:57.920 --> 01:48:03.720]  speed electrons down these wiring and then put them in and put it into
[01:48:03.720 --> 01:48:08.160]  devices but then you start actually broadcasting all this and microwave
[01:48:08.160 --> 01:48:12.040]  radiation and all of it it only intensifies the health issues then the
[01:48:12.040 --> 01:48:16.920]  surveillance issues and then how it dials into all the devices and sends that
[01:48:16.920 --> 01:48:20.440]  data back and now they're oh the new smart meters will be your wireless
[01:48:20.440 --> 01:48:25.160]  internet it is an outside group setting the precedent to invade your
[01:48:25.160 --> 01:48:30.760]  household and the answer here is for consumers just like with organic food
[01:48:30.760 --> 01:48:36.680]  and other issues to demand demand that we have a choice and demand that these
[01:48:36.680 --> 01:48:43.000]  systems not blurb every 25 seconds and send back data not run bad power through
[01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:48.160]  our house not surveillance not control the temperature of our thermostats now
[01:48:48.160 --> 01:48:54.080]  Dr. Laura Presley's here and she works with local Austin grips to fight against
[01:48:54.080 --> 01:48:57.960]  this successfully and the scary news is you're you've gotten an opt out for
[01:48:57.960 --> 01:49:02.200]  $10 a month which is a lot more reasonable still be a huge profit for
[01:49:02.200 --> 01:49:05.880]  the meter readers and keep them in a job but you're saying the Texas Utility
[01:49:05.880 --> 01:49:10.960]  Commission's talking about a hundred bucks a month that is literally raping
[01:49:10.960 --> 01:49:15.960]  and abusing people for the right to opt out of these surveillance devices that's
[01:49:15.960 --> 01:49:20.200]  right the Public Utility Commission here in Texas has taken this issue up of
[01:49:20.200 --> 01:49:24.160]  opt out and they've been working on it for several years and you know they're
[01:49:24.160 --> 01:49:28.520]  proposing to replace your meter Austin's gonna use $75 fee to replace the meter
[01:49:28.520 --> 01:49:33.400]  back to the old analog one that we had in 2009 okay but there the Public
[01:49:33.400 --> 01:49:37.400]  Utility Commission is looking at two to four hundred dollars to replace the old
[01:49:37.400 --> 01:49:41.280]  meter back and then a huge fee you know per month fifty dollars a hundred
[01:49:41.280 --> 01:49:45.680]  dollars a month to come read your meter and it is outrageous they don't want
[01:49:45.680 --> 01:49:49.080]  people to opt out by the way think to turn it think about this this is how
[01:49:49.080 --> 01:49:53.000]  these big corporations come and give massive amounts of money to have your
[01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:57.160]  city make you take this exactly just like when you buy a dishwasher that has
[01:49:57.160 --> 01:50:01.640]  smart stuff spying on you or a computer you're paying in the cell phone for the
[01:50:01.640 --> 01:50:06.040]  mandated crud to spy on you right it jacks up the prices of everything right
[01:50:06.040 --> 01:50:10.000]  and we never opted into this if you recall you know this has gone on since
[01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.920]  2009 here and here in Texas well go over your list you've got a lot more for
[01:50:12.920 --> 01:50:16.880]  folks so the other thing I want to talk a lot about the health effects that this
[01:50:16.880 --> 01:50:20.960]  causes there's a new documentary out and you carry it at the Info War Store it's
[01:50:20.960 --> 01:50:25.200]  take back your power we are going to have a free screening of that here in
[01:50:25.200 --> 01:50:29.760]  Austin at Brave New Books at 1904 Guadalupe Street next Saturday
[01:50:29.760 --> 01:50:34.320]  November 16th at 7 p.m. and what's interesting about that documentary it
[01:50:34.320 --> 01:50:40.840]  has they did a study of people who they did a live blood analysis they did a
[01:50:40.840 --> 01:50:45.360]  dark field blood analysis of red blood cells they pulled people's blood before
[01:50:45.360 --> 01:50:48.600]  they put them in front of a smart meter and the red blood cells look normal then
[01:50:48.600 --> 01:50:52.440]  they put the people in front of a smart meter for about two minutes about two
[01:50:52.440 --> 01:50:57.360]  feet away it was shocking Alex what the blood results showed the red blood cells
[01:50:57.360 --> 01:51:02.000]  had ruptured they were distorted and they started stacking up upon each other
[01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:07.240]  and so bottom line is it affects your blood it affects by the way I've talked
[01:51:07.240 --> 01:51:10.400]  to engineers they say these things like a hundred times more powerful than a
[01:51:10.400 --> 01:51:13.840]  cell phone I just reminded me all the studies about cell phones and these
[01:51:13.840 --> 01:51:17.560]  brain tumors on the side of the head you using on that's what it said it breaks
[01:51:17.560 --> 01:51:22.320]  the DNA and breaks up the cells vibrating in fact guys search engine on the
[01:51:22.320 --> 01:51:28.240]  NSA database Google a search engine cell phones break DNA cell phone rate it'll
[01:51:28.240 --> 01:51:32.400]  be like BBC AP so think of this thinking that's thinking the iron in your blood as
[01:51:32.400 --> 01:51:36.480]  an antenna all right it's a metal so that's why the red blood cell and there's
[01:51:36.480 --> 01:51:40.640]  iron that's right that's why the red blood cells are so susceptible okay and
[01:51:40.640 --> 01:51:47.480]  so what's interesting is a signature of health issues is anemia my husband
[01:51:47.480 --> 01:51:52.040]  and I both had anemia okay after we figured out kind of what's going on
[01:51:52.040 --> 01:51:56.760]  with this smart meter and women women typically can get anemia because of how
[01:51:56.760 --> 01:52:02.520]  our cycles are but men to have anemia is a really huge anomaly and so this is
[01:52:02.520 --> 01:52:06.520]  what's happening the red blood cells are being damaged and you can't you can't
[01:52:06.520 --> 01:52:10.040]  replenish them and so you're you're low in iron is it there's just like fluoride
[01:52:10.040 --> 01:52:13.560]  though they knew when they put it in they knew the Soviets and the Nazis used
[01:52:13.560 --> 01:52:16.560]  it to control people and pulled surprise winning books Nuremberg trials
[01:52:16.560 --> 01:52:20.080]  documented it they put that in our water and now they're doing this to us this is
[01:52:20.080 --> 01:52:24.200]  population reduction well back in the 70s there were studies done by the
[01:52:24.200 --> 01:52:28.080]  military and salmon mail ham dr. Sam mail ham who's the author of dirty
[01:52:28.080 --> 01:52:33.160]  electricity he had he recorded back in the 1970s that the military understood
[01:52:33.160 --> 01:52:37.520]  that pulsed microwave energy which is what these smart meters are putting out
[01:52:37.520 --> 01:52:42.840]  does cause a lot of immune response issues causes cancer and that was that's
[01:52:42.840 --> 01:52:46.720]  documented in his book for the last you know last 40 to 50 years we've been
[01:52:46.720 --> 01:52:50.120]  aware of this so I want people to understand that these smart meter this
[01:52:50.120 --> 01:52:53.640]  is why you you feel tall look look look look hold on I think we found it what
[01:52:53.640 --> 01:52:58.240]  what publication is that scrolled it daily mail mobile phone radiation damages
[01:52:58.240 --> 01:53:02.480]  DNA you got it in new major study and there's literally hundreds of these
[01:53:02.480 --> 01:53:07.280]  radio waves for mobile phones to do harm cells and damage DNA European research
[01:53:07.280 --> 01:53:13.560]  has revealed the four-year reflex study found genomes the carrier of genes were
[01:53:13.560 --> 01:53:17.720]  harmed by exposure to electromagnetic fields from such technology if you go
[01:53:17.720 --> 01:53:22.960]  through it it breaks them in half and attacked red blood cells oh well let's
[01:53:22.960 --> 01:53:27.000]  put something hundreds of times more powerful and wonder what it's why not
[01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:30.920]  just flame throw everyone well that will know then we notice and fight back yes
[01:53:30.920 --> 01:53:34.880]  as well your the microwave frequency that's being used in these smart meters
[01:53:34.880 --> 01:53:39.080]  is 2.5 gigahertz which is the same frequency that your microwave oven
[01:53:39.080 --> 01:53:42.560]  uses to cook your food it's just so we're the smart mirrors a little bit
[01:53:42.560 --> 01:53:45.840]  lower pattern well why don't we just put our babies in the microwave then for so
[01:53:45.840 --> 01:53:49.600]  we reduce the population well you know I'm not saying literally do that folks
[01:53:49.600 --> 01:53:54.200]  will probably do it if Obama said to I mean this is crazy it's crazy and so the
[01:53:54.200 --> 01:53:58.360]  the the myriad of health issues you know muscle contractions that my husband and
[01:53:58.360 --> 01:54:02.000]  I were having involuntary muscle contractions inflammation headaches
[01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:06.320]  insomnia concentration problems swelling chest pains think about your
[01:54:06.320 --> 01:54:12.160]  bloods being damaged your oxygen transfer is not happening your you know
[01:54:12.160 --> 01:54:16.000]  you're tired you're having a lot of problems with with your energy level
[01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:20.720]  your thyroid is being affected all of it this stuff is dangerous people need to
[01:54:20.720 --> 01:54:25.280]  opt out turn this stuff off and you know and if your electric company won't
[01:54:25.280 --> 01:54:30.080]  replace your smart meter there are a lot of things you can do to order your own
[01:54:30.080 --> 01:54:36.280]  meter analog meters you can get online $16 for a meter and you know what go to
[01:54:36.280 --> 01:54:40.680]  your electric company with a doctor some information from your doctor and say
[01:54:40.680 --> 01:54:45.400]  this is self-defense I have to replace this thing and you know the other the
[01:54:45.400 --> 01:54:48.640]  other thing I want to talk about to Alex is our gas meters are also smart
[01:54:48.640 --> 01:54:54.800]  meters they pulse about the same rate at every 25 seconds or so they put out of
[01:54:54.800 --> 01:54:58.520]  power density that's about half of the electric smart meters because they use a
[01:54:58.520 --> 01:55:03.000]  little battery so that's something else is what we've worked with here in Austin
[01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:07.240]  on the gas meters to be opted out and on the smart Austin smart meters calm
[01:55:07.240 --> 01:55:12.200]  we've got a number there you can call that opt out of your gas meter also so
[01:55:12.200 --> 01:55:18.400]  just the big picture anemia tired low energy low oxygen transfer that's well
[01:55:18.400 --> 01:55:22.080]  documented in this this wonderful documentary take back your power I
[01:55:22.080 --> 01:55:26.840]  recommend everybody order that and get that become educated and and also turn
[01:55:26.840 --> 01:55:30.840]  all your wireless devices off at home you know we complain about the smart
[01:55:30.840 --> 01:55:35.400]  meter but let's take some well there's also studies ability on our own and turn
[01:55:35.400 --> 01:55:38.560]  your turn your router off turn your wireless printer off turn your phone
[01:55:38.560 --> 01:55:42.560]  off turn your cordless phone off there's so many wireless devices that were
[01:55:42.560 --> 01:55:46.680]  bathed in just like you said we have to terrible as a chemist you know that most
[01:55:46.680 --> 01:55:50.800]  poisons become addictive because the body then changes its whole metabolic
[01:55:50.800 --> 01:55:54.720]  system to it if there's another study people just type this in mainline
[01:55:54.720 --> 01:55:58.680]  studies that cell phones are addictive and heat the brain one degree that's
[01:55:58.680 --> 01:56:03.760]  BBC heat the brain one degree are addictive that's why folks not just
[01:56:03.760 --> 01:56:07.120]  addicted to the screen they can't talk to each other we're all just being fried
[01:56:07.120 --> 01:56:12.640]  but it's also very toxic like aspartame we're becoming addicted to it I mean this
[01:56:12.640 --> 01:56:16.960]  is a science fiction movie this this is incredible everybody just do the test
[01:56:16.960 --> 01:56:20.680]  get rid of the smart meter see what happens get the wireless out of your
[01:56:20.680 --> 01:56:25.040]  house plug into the wall run a wire over to where you're at use ethernet for a
[01:56:25.040 --> 01:56:29.800]  while see how good you sleep see what happens I'm telling you Dr. Laura
[01:56:29.800 --> 01:56:34.600]  Presley give out the local Austin site again people should get the film at
[01:56:34.600 --> 01:56:37.640]  info or store.com so they understand what's happening they should go to your
[01:56:37.640 --> 01:56:42.000]  site and use that battle plan that you and others help develop to at least get
[01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:46.160]  us the opt-out for $10 and so we can then fight harder and then know go back
[01:56:46.160 --> 01:56:49.880]  and show that these are actually less expensive and just go back and do studies
[01:56:49.880 --> 01:56:53.280]  to find out what it really costs to have them read by a human plus it's the whole
[01:56:53.280 --> 01:56:58.720]  movement of phasing humans out anyway. Yes so it's austinsmartmeters.com and
[01:56:58.720 --> 01:57:02.480]  there's a lot of information health information recommendation solutions the
[01:57:02.480 --> 01:57:07.400]  form to opt out in Austin is on the website so you can go there print the
[01:57:07.400 --> 01:57:12.440]  form out fill it in and send it in also again take back your power is we're
[01:57:12.440 --> 01:57:18.400]  showing that documentary this Saturday Austin Brave New Books 1904 Guadalupe
[01:57:18.400 --> 01:57:22.920]  excited now stopping right there folks have got to get the film have showings
[01:57:22.920 --> 01:57:28.560]  in their area take action this isn't just Austin Texas you can do it and this
[01:57:28.560 --> 01:57:32.360]  is a major victory against the globalist and we're gonna continue we're on the
[01:57:32.360 --> 01:57:37.360]  March the globalist the eugenicist the anti-human New World Order they are in
[01:57:37.360 --> 01:57:41.080]  the trouble they are on the run doc thank you so much for coming on with us
[01:57:41.080 --> 01:57:44.600]  all right folks Lord willing I'll be back tomorrow 11 a.m. central with a
