[00:00.000 --> 00:13.500]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex
[00:13.500 --> 00:31.800]  Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones all right we
[00:31.800 --> 00:35.960]  do have obviously a ton of incredibly important news here on the day before the end of the
[00:35.960 --> 00:40.920]  world and I'm being sarcastic but there's probably going to be some hysteria tonight
[00:40.920 --> 00:47.620]  tomorrow the next day we've got some very very frightening reports here very concerning
[00:47.620 --> 00:52.500]  reports are going to be going over from around the world not just here in the United States
[00:52.500 --> 00:57.420]  we've also got a bunch of fiscal cliff news the globalist are driving us off the fiscal
[00:57.420 --> 01:02.220]  cliff trance is the model they will just keep bankrupting things and bankrupting things
[01:02.220 --> 01:07.140]  until there is an 80 plus percent federal tax rate and the globalist of course will
[01:07.140 --> 01:11.700]  be exempt and get all that money that's why the ultra rich sleaze bags like Warren Buffett
[01:11.700 --> 01:16.700]  Bill Gates all of them are lobbying for more taxes because their tax exempt don't know
[01:16.700 --> 01:23.900]  how else to explain that to everybody they're all in tax-free foundations and they the general
[01:23.900 --> 01:28.660]  public he says no idea how things really work it's so frustrating to watch these crooks
[01:28.660 --> 01:31.780]  and that's what they are Warren Buffett's been engaged in all sorts of criminal bailouts
[01:31.780 --> 01:35.700]  to come out in the news he never gets in trouble this makes the Keating five look like good
[01:35.700 --> 01:42.820]  guys so we're going to be breaking all that down today and more on the state police in
[01:42.820 --> 01:51.620]  Texas defending pulling people over and doing cavity searches now and they say they're just
[01:51.620 --> 01:58.180]  going to set up checkpoints basically start doing this this country is just living in
[01:58.180 --> 02:02.500]  the twilight zone and it's only going to get more insane from here on out so we're going
[02:02.500 --> 02:06.500]  to be breaking that down obviously the open assault on the second amendment with a new
[02:06.500 --> 02:12.060]  task force that will call for well banning of all semi-autos banning of sale banning
[02:12.060 --> 02:19.860]  of private sales selling a gun to your neighbor or trading a gun just an absolute way to assault
[02:19.860 --> 02:25.140]  gun owners in this country and when people people on a no gun by list we're going to
[02:25.140 --> 02:30.420]  be breaking all of that down as well just extra judicial activities where they just
[02:30.420 --> 02:36.340]  throw you on a list we're going to be going over all of these different facets from different
[02:36.340 --> 02:40.420]  angles today and when we come back in the next segment I'm going to give the phones
[02:40.420 --> 02:45.940]  out the phone number out it's important to take calls and I don't take as many as I'd
[02:45.940 --> 02:51.380]  like and I always kind of repeat myself and I have a wish to take more calls and a cocktail
[02:51.380 --> 02:56.820]  of things always happens where you get people calling with such interesting topics that
[02:56.820 --> 03:00.580]  we digress for 20 minutes or I don't get to your calls for an hour or when I do get to
[03:00.580 --> 03:06.140]  your calls it's just all over the map which is sometimes interesting sometimes not I mean
[03:06.140 --> 03:09.420]  obviously I'd like to talk about the state of our world and what you see coming up in
[03:09.420 --> 03:17.220]  2013 do you see it as a critical year the most critical in our our history or do you
[03:17.220 --> 03:22.060]  just think that everything's going to be fine or somewhere in between I'll give the number
[03:22.060 --> 03:30.060]  out coming up in the next segment and we'll discuss some of that obviously we also are
[03:30.060 --> 03:34.140]  going to have a very informative guest on today to give us kind of a foreshadowing and
[03:34.140 --> 03:39.580]  an idea of what the NRA is going to do tomorrow in a press conference they're going to have
[03:39.580 --> 03:45.820]  and that's Bob Barr the former congressman and also activist with Liberty Guard resisting
[03:45.820 --> 03:50.660]  the tyranny of the TSA he is an NRA board member and he will be joining us coming up
[03:50.660 --> 03:57.500]  for about 30 minutes in the third hour today to talk about Sandy Hook and to talk about
[03:57.500 --> 04:03.820]  the Newtown massacre and all the rest of it there is also a video that's not even on
[04:03.820 --> 04:13.460]  info wars.com yet I'm going to get it posted up there Obama runs gun hoax actually I think
[04:13.460 --> 04:18.420]  we should change that headline to Obama caught in gun hoax that guys you give that to the
[04:18.420 --> 04:26.220]  webmasters in there and have them post Obama caught in gun hoax when I shot this special
[04:26.220 --> 04:31.660]  report last night before I left I think I wanted to go with the headline Obama caught

[04:40.980 --> 04:44.380]  fraud I don't know we'll figure out a headline it's very important I want to play that here

[08:57.060 --> 09:03.500]  anti gunners powerful video right there peers morgan sarcasm about school massacre stokes
[09:03.500 --> 09:10.100]  anger he actually said on his twitter that he's glad about the shooting because now we
[09:10.100 --> 09:16.820]  can get our guns a very very sick filthy person the lowest of the low scum caught lying basically
[09:16.820 --> 09:22.540]  with tabloids about people and running all sorts of just absolutely wicked operations
[09:22.540 --> 09:25.820]  reportedly with hacking that's why you really won't go back to england because the word
[09:25.820 --> 09:29.580]  is they're going to slap handcuffs on him and that's what they do they import lowest
[09:29.580 --> 09:36.860]  of the low to this country to come here and tell us to turn our guns in it's it's amazing
[09:36.860 --> 09:43.060]  continuing obama orders children murdered that's a special report we did on the drones
[09:43.060 --> 09:48.940]  where he signs death orders knowing it will kill children a very powerful video that I
[09:48.940 --> 09:53.940]  would imagine they're going to try to censor so see it while you can media calls for obama
[09:53.940 --> 09:59.460]  to act like a dictator and ban guns that's another video report on our text report from
[09:59.460 --> 10:05.100]  yesterday and of course Reuters calling for that and that is just some of what we're going
[10:05.100 --> 10:10.380]  to be breaking down on the second amendment front today guns out of stock at walmart as
[10:10.380 --> 10:18.380]  magazine prices surge they are selling out everywhere in fact I actually talked to some
[10:18.380 --> 10:23.340]  folks that work at dick sporting goods in the gun department and they said look they were
[10:23.340 --> 10:28.580]  already sold out of bushmasters and couldn't get them and I happen to know that most gunshops
[10:28.580 --> 10:33.820]  were sold out of most semi-automatics especially the military style it just means they're black
[10:33.820 --> 10:36.980]  they're not wooden pretty much the same thing as the hunting rifles these idiots don't know
[10:36.980 --> 10:42.380]  that and that they were already sold out in dicks all over the country bushmaster is six
[10:42.380 --> 10:49.540]  months to nine months depending on the type a year behind a year well we've talked about
[10:49.540 --> 10:55.140]  this before a ruger is almost a year out most manufacturers are six months to a year out
[10:55.140 --> 11:02.660]  so it's it's it's a total hoax as usual everything's a hoax with these people that oh they're
[11:02.660 --> 11:13.980]  not going to sell the guns now they can't get the guns now I wanted a 50 caliber I already
[11:13.980 --> 11:19.940]  have one I got about a decade ago or more but I wanted a Barrett and I had to look around
[11:19.940 --> 11:25.260]  for three months and pay a premium and ship it into a gun shop here in Austin actually
[11:25.260 --> 11:30.900]  a police supply facility that sells to the general population as well from North Carolina
[11:30.900 --> 11:35.060]  three months to get one that was months ago and I'm going to roll that sucker out on the
[11:35.060 --> 11:40.420]  TV show as soon as we relaunch it but the brothers and arms gun show first thing we're
[11:40.420 --> 11:44.860]  going to do is go up in helicopters and take care of some wild hogs but side issue grab
[11:44.860 --> 11:48.580]  another drone episode come on as well I've just been so busy I don't have time to even
[11:48.580 --> 11:55.180]  even stop and smell the roses ever because there's so much globalist crime going on so
[11:55.180 --> 12:02.300]  that's some of the gun news also guns Obama administration handed to Mexican drug lords
[12:02.300 --> 12:07.860]  continue to turn up at crime scenes in Mexico and the US including another dead child so
[12:07.860 --> 12:13.900]  that's up at prisonplanet.com and in full wars.com Hillary is continuing to be sick now for four
[12:13.900 --> 12:19.260]  or five days over she can't testify about Benghazi they're caught red handed they ordered
[12:19.260 --> 12:25.500]  a White House stand down for eight hours they had a huge CIA torture base full of special
[12:25.500 --> 12:31.180]  forces down the street that's another big scandal of course Obama has increased the torturing
[12:31.180 --> 12:35.580]  see if Obama says one thing he's going to do the other unless he promises to take your
[12:35.580 --> 12:40.140]  guns and destroy freedom and bankrupt the country then of course he keeps those promises
[12:40.140 --> 12:45.780]  so we're going to be looking at some of that today as well and up well they've now because
[12:45.780 --> 12:52.100]  of the lawsuit the public backlash they've suspended with pay the Texas female trooper
[12:52.100 --> 12:57.980]  who was called to the scene by male troopers to on video and we showed this yesterday it's
[12:57.980 --> 13:05.020]  it's now a big story around the country after drudge report linked to yesterday actually
[13:05.020 --> 13:12.820]  with force shoving her hand into the woman's rear end and then into in the pants with force
[13:12.820 --> 13:18.460]  you could see it into her female sexual organ and then she goes over to her sister both
[13:18.460 --> 13:21.740]  attractive women it's funny it always seems to be attractive women I don't know what it
[13:21.740 --> 13:26.500]  is about defiling them just seems to bring in the sharks with TSA and others and then
[13:26.500 --> 13:30.740]  they went after the other one with the same glove and it's in the court filing with the
[13:30.740 --> 13:37.940]  doctor's report one woman got a serious infection that's a big deal that's a big deal you know
[13:37.940 --> 13:42.340]  if you're a man out there maybe public school you know brought up on riddling in prozac
[13:42.340 --> 13:46.780]  never had a girlfriend never been married you know infections with women is a big deal
[13:46.780 --> 13:50.460]  and you know the first thing girls are taught is don't touch the back and then the front
[13:50.460 --> 13:56.020]  night to get off into all this but it's a woman doing this to her so there's the beautiful
[13:56.020 --> 14:07.020]  blonde with the female trooper grabbing her breast and then going into well into her rectum
[14:07.020 --> 14:12.460]  and then turning around oh let me just let me just repeatedly go checking in there and
[14:12.460 --> 14:18.780]  now she goes in the front and she really goes after her sister and oh and this is all supposedly
[14:18.780 --> 14:24.220]  looking for marijuana which is the only drug the government doesn't ship in in mass though
[14:24.220 --> 14:29.740]  they've been caught doing that they ship in the heroin the cocaine a lot of the pre ingredients
[14:29.740 --> 14:33.620]  are sold to the methamphetamine labs that are authorized not the small bathtub ones
[14:33.620 --> 14:38.460]  they target they're trying to put half the school kids on deadly psychotropics and speed
[14:38.460 --> 14:43.660]  drugs like riddling the troops have been ordered for 11 years to publicly grow the
[14:43.660 --> 14:49.100]  opium it went from 9% of the world supply to 93% out of Afghanistan giant C-130s flying
[14:49.100 --> 14:54.740]  in in daily smack epidemic all over Europe all over Asia publicly the US military is
[14:54.740 --> 15:00.940]  forced to grow it give them the fertilizer security ship it in so the troopers can pull
[15:00.940 --> 15:07.060]  you over saying they saw you flick a cigarette out the window they think it might be marijuana
[15:07.060 --> 15:09.900]  and then they just order you and you know if you don't follow the order they're gonna
[15:09.900 --> 15:14.100]  taser you resist that they're gonna gun you down and you have to understand something
[15:14.100 --> 15:19.340]  at first the state police said this is good this is their policy the director of DPS when
[15:19.340 --> 15:26.660]  this video got reviewed first by the local head you know captain that's why the suits
[15:26.660 --> 15:30.540]  now happening and when the public was outraged they went oh okay we'll suspender with pay
[15:30.540 --> 15:41.700]  we'll look at it now someone explained something to you when these lunatics pull you over now
[15:41.700 --> 15:45.300]  they're not just gonna take your blood without warrants or rubber stamps they're not just
[15:45.300 --> 15:49.180]  gonna take your kids to CPS for no reason they're now gonna jam their hands into your
[15:49.180 --> 15:57.060]  body just like I've watched TSA search 20 people in a row with the same glove and I mean going
[15:57.060 --> 16:03.300]  in the pants I mean imagine any country in history where they stick their hands on your
[16:03.300 --> 16:08.900]  pants and the TSA backed off a little bit and stopped really squeezing all the time when
[16:08.900 --> 16:12.700]  there were lawsuits and things but now the police are doing so I'm gonna get back into
[16:12.700 --> 16:18.940]  that today as well I want to get into the latest 2012 news and there is a lot of it
[16:18.940 --> 16:23.780]  we'll be tracking it throughout the day and then tomorrow in sometimes zones I guess midnight
[16:23.780 --> 16:29.260]  tonight my time and sometimes zones I guess in Asia the end of the world will begin no
[16:29.260 --> 16:34.780]  one knows the exact hour of when it's gonna begin up again NASA is gonna be sarcastic
[16:34.780 --> 16:38.200]  and to be clear I don't believe it's the other world never have said that NASA is getting
[16:38.200 --> 16:43.300]  flooded with calls emails people showing up saying why won't you tell us where Nabooru
[16:43.300 --> 16:48.020]  Planet X is it's gonna kill us well let me let me explain something to the people panicking
[16:48.020 --> 16:53.220]  in Japan and China and France and the United States and Mexico everywhere else people are
[16:53.220 --> 16:58.180]  people pretty darn stupid some of the time I'm explain something to you there is no
[16:58.180 --> 17:06.620]  Mayan prophecy it doesn't say this a b if you had a big gas giant like they claim Nabooru
[17:06.620 --> 17:18.180]  is if it was gonna hit us in the next 24 hours it would be gigantic okay amateur astronomers
[17:18.180 --> 17:23.980]  with the hundreds of thousands of telescopes I've got one cost me like $5,000 that I bought
[17:23.980 --> 17:28.100]  back in college when I had time I go out in the hills at night where it was clear out
[17:28.100 --> 17:32.860]  in the desert outside Austin like Lano and I could see you know the pink and purple of
[17:32.860 --> 17:37.500]  Saturn I could find asteroids when it was clear night well-known asteroids nebulas I
[17:37.500 --> 17:41.940]  took some great photos of those the point is is that I'm gonna find where those are
[17:41.940 --> 17:45.740]  I got a bunch of incredible photos I took with my dad hook in a camera up to the telescope
[17:45.740 --> 17:52.300]  ten inch mead reflector and even back then you can computerize programming it would
[17:52.300 --> 17:57.740]  track everything is amazing most of the Kuiper belt objects that have been found out past
[17:57.740 --> 18:01.500]  Pluto there are hundreds of them were found by amateur astronomers because they're they're
[18:01.500 --> 18:07.220]  the ones that are able to have more eyes on the data not the big giant ones not the big
[18:07.220 --> 18:15.220]  McDonald Douglas you know out in West Texas there is now doomsday panic going on okay
[18:15.220 --> 18:19.660]  and I pray that there's not violence I pray that there's not attacks I pray that there's
[18:19.660 --> 18:24.380]  not mass suicides or mass shootings there's a lot of in the world stuff going on right
[18:24.380 --> 18:29.540]  now I hope there's not hellbop top stuff and I'll add this I tuned in to talk radio this

[23:05.140 --> 23:11.460]  important information in 1985 president Ronald Reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly
[23:11.460 --> 23:16.100]  to the White House at a time when only the president could obtain this world-class healer
[23:16.100 --> 23:21.620]  now 27 years later carnivore capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy

[23:58.220 --> 24:16.300]  by the way it's gotten almost no attention you know few weeks ago Rand Paul declared
[24:16.300 --> 24:22.220]  victory I think he was fooled and said hey we've got an amendment to the NDAA saying
[24:22.220 --> 24:26.780]  you can't secretly arrest Americans and disappear them but actually that amendment said you
[24:26.780 --> 24:31.500]  can't do it in this act unless already in another act so it was a little lawyer trick
[24:31.500 --> 24:36.500]  but they've dropped the Feinstein amendment completely and are expanding it to not only
[24:36.500 --> 24:42.100]  secretly arrest citizens but openly get rid of what's left of Posse Comintatus and designate
[24:42.100 --> 24:48.220]  the U.S. Army to take out veterans gun owners constitutionalists who are listed as the main
[24:48.220 --> 24:54.500]  terror threat not Al Qaeda openly run by the federal occupational government again they
[24:54.500 --> 24:59.380]  black brag everywhere that they run America they've captured us you're a new listener
[24:59.380 --> 25:08.580]  you can just go to infowars.com and just type in the search engine there on the site bankers
[25:08.580 --> 25:12.860]  declare they've conquered the U.S. and Europe and then you can see dozens of links and video
[25:12.860 --> 25:19.620]  clips where world leaders amounts we are their slaves they're very proud of it so infowars.com
[25:19.620 --> 25:26.500]  for slash search and you can find all that bankers declare U.S. and Europe conquered
[25:26.500 --> 25:31.300]  and you can find that right there for you I think it's kind of a big deal and they have
[25:31.300 --> 25:36.860]  conquered us they now pull over our people and ran their hands into our bodies with no
[25:36.860 --> 25:45.500]  judge no jury no drug dog no nothing they use the same glove on four different orifices
[25:45.500 --> 25:50.820]  again I mean they're now saying this is standard we're going to do this to everybody they're
[25:50.820 --> 25:57.500]  defending it and they will start disappearing people they've got pickup list they've already
[25:57.500 --> 26:01.420]  set up they're already trying the police for that just to arrest you under a national
[26:01.420 --> 26:08.260]  security filing in the in the database where it's not an arrest warrant it's a pickup order
[26:08.260 --> 26:12.660]  and you just disappear and then there's CIA bases in the U.S. and all over the world where
[26:12.660 --> 26:17.180]  what was in the news again this week where they sodomize you first thing they do because
[26:17.180 --> 26:21.100]  they like it I mean they do it themselves they enjoy it so but that's what the good
[26:21.100 --> 26:27.620]  guys do according to according to them including children I know it's completely evil you're
[26:27.620 --> 26:31.460]  like man this is really crazy what he's saying yeah it is crazy isn't it and it's all happening
[26:31.460 --> 26:37.460]  and it's all going to get worse because we say 50 plus million babies and since 1973
[26:37.460 --> 26:41.960]  weren't humans and if you could rationalize that killing babies in the womb up to nine
[26:41.960 --> 26:47.780]  months when they could be adopted on the spot is not a human but one minute after they're
[26:47.780 --> 26:53.020]  out of the womb you'll be charged with murder one if you kill that baby you know if people
[26:53.020 --> 26:58.060]  can rationalize that well then the sky's the limit and I'm already ranting here in doomsday
[26:58.060 --> 27:03.620]  news and believe me it's pouring out local school district cancels classes due to doomsday
[27:03.620 --> 27:11.860]  talk potential threats by the way I saw all sorts of head-on collisions driving into work
[27:11.860 --> 27:15.980]  today people being blown out of their lanes on four lane roads two lanes one way two lanes
[27:15.980 --> 27:20.620]  the other if I was people in central Texas I'd stay off the road right now that's the
[27:20.620 --> 27:25.300]  real threat there's some deaths happening out there I can tell you that right now I mean
[27:25.300 --> 27:28.900]  I've never had my vehicle blown around like it was today except when I went through a tornado
[27:28.900 --> 27:35.040]  once side issue maybe that's planet X coming in to kill us I'm joined I'm joking continuing
[27:35.040 --> 27:43.180]  here fearful into the world callers flood NASA that's out of the Los Angeles Times
[27:43.180 --> 27:49.380]  if there's one government agency really looking forward to December 22nd it's NASA the space
[27:49.380 --> 27:53.060]  agency said it's been flooded with calls emails or people asking about the purport into the
[27:53.060 --> 27:58.620]  world which as the doomsday myth goes is apparently set to take place December 21st
[27:58.620 --> 28:07.540]  2012 and people are freaking out if the Mayan prophecy is true just how might it all end
[28:07.540 --> 28:13.860]  on Friday scientists foretell the cataclysms that could bring on doomsday and I'm thinking
[28:13.860 --> 28:23.220]  about doing a live Skype tonight from the undisclosed location or not Skype Justin TV
[28:23.220 --> 28:31.660]  or one of those channels that we have channels on to give a speech maybe at 11 o'clock tonight
[28:31.660 --> 28:35.700]  12 o'clock Eastern where in many parts the world for many hours the end of the world
[28:35.700 --> 28:42.700]  will be well into well into transpiring and I can I guess also go out in the parking lot
[28:42.700 --> 28:48.380]  of the Christmas party and aim my camera up the sky and try to find the big red planet
[28:48.380 --> 28:53.580]  coming to kill us and of course or they say the sun's gonna blow up or they say that there's
[28:53.580 --> 28:58.220]  gonna be a pole shift or a bunch of other garbage like comets hitting us and the rest
[28:58.220 --> 29:05.380]  of it and then meanwhile all the real crises are just being ignored and I guarantee you
[29:05.380 --> 29:11.420]  they're gonna say Gregorian calendar three days difference the 21st is really the 24th
[29:11.420 --> 29:16.060]  will be dead in three days look for that I just know how this stuff works because I
[29:16.060 --> 29:22.500]  remember back in 2000 2001 2003 it was always another year planet X number two were all
[29:22.500 --> 29:32.780]  dead and meanwhile rogue planets do come through the inner solar system Kuiper belt objects
[29:32.780 --> 29:36.300]  there are comets there are there are real threats I'm not saying that couldn't happen
[29:36.300 --> 29:41.940]  someday there's evidence it's happened many times before the problem is it isn't happening
[29:41.940 --> 29:53.220]  tomorrow your calls coming up stay with us we're on the March the empires on the run

[33:53.180 --> 33:58.620]  and military for gun confiscation the last few years in the army manuals i mean it's it's it's
[33:58.620 --> 34:04.700]  a fact that guys you guys type in army manual covers a gun confiscation it's an info wars dot
[34:04.700 --> 34:10.060]  com article but it links to the army manual it's a different one than the relocation mass arrest

[34:16.700 --> 34:22.060]  the army manual that came out to what two years ago and so the military is training for this and
[34:22.060 --> 34:26.540]  and it's had the side effect that's a good side effect of actually waking the military up they're
[34:26.540 --> 34:33.980]  like wow we're being trained to lock down u.s cities and go door to door taking guns and again
[34:33.980 --> 34:39.180]  you're like this will never happen ladies and gentlemen if i told you five years ago that the
[34:39.180 --> 34:46.140]  state police would pull over people for tail lights out or for flicking a cigarette or for no
[34:46.140 --> 34:49.660]  insurance or whatever because now they have license plate readers that can tell if you're out of

[36:57.100 --> 37:03.260]  vet this is the type of stuff that we're talking about here as a society

[37:43.980 --> 37:52.220]  their teeth out with pliers they run al-qaeda on record this is not our government and only
[37:52.220 --> 37:56.380]  admitting the truth is going to save us it's compartmentalization where they've now got it where
[37:57.180 --> 38:02.540]  federal and state courts have ruled if you don't answer a cop's question they taser you as part of
[38:02.540 --> 38:07.820]  pain compliance and the courts say oh that's okay oh you know in one case in new york state
[38:07.820 --> 38:12.380]  a few years ago it was uh the man would not give a urine sample all strapped to a gurney
[38:14.380 --> 38:20.780]  so they tasered him 11 times it was another case where the guy had a heart attack and died
[38:20.780 --> 38:28.860]  and the court said that's okay they kill you with electricity if if if you don't urinate in a cup when
[38:28.860 --> 38:36.380]  they order you to folks that is a north korean death dungeon oh but it's to stop drugs the war on
[38:36.380 --> 38:41.180]  drugs the government publicly ships in that's the illegal ones then they're always trying to um
[38:42.460 --> 38:46.940]  you know get everybody on their psychotropic and stuff that's even worse so so i said i'd go to your
[38:46.940 --> 38:52.780]  calls i just want everybody to get here i'm not putting a bad face on the government the government's
[38:52.780 --> 38:58.060]  gone and the only thing holding it back is that some of the bureaucrats in the government aren't pure
[38:58.060 --> 39:03.740]  evil and so they don't fully enforce what they've been told to enforce they want you broken
[39:05.180 --> 39:10.460]  we're now all over the country they do cavity searches i see this in florida
[39:10.460 --> 39:14.700]  arizona tennessee i see these articles all the time and the videos
[39:18.380 --> 39:21.260]  yeah court rules that cia tortured and sodomized
[39:21.260 --> 39:29.180]  innocent person but i mean it was a bad guy why do you sodomize them you like it
[39:30.380 --> 39:34.220]  you see where can you go chain people down and it's still illegal but they get away with it
[39:34.220 --> 39:39.820]  under national security and rape them well the cia or one of these private defense contractor groups
[39:39.820 --> 39:44.460]  and i just can't believe how much trouble we're in and now they're like well yeah we're going to
[39:44.460 --> 39:50.060]  pull you over and get your daughters out and we don't change gloves on you animals i mean it's
[39:50.060 --> 39:55.020]  bad enough and and and it's right to do this these women but but now we're seeing as animals
[39:56.620 --> 39:59.740]  where the tsa sticks their hands down people's pants all day and i've sat there
[40:00.700 --> 40:04.460]  after i've gone through the security checkpoint you know for the underwear bomber the government
[40:04.460 --> 40:08.540]  put on the plane and i've sat there and watched him and they just get people all day and just go
[40:08.540 --> 40:15.980]  right in their pants same glove it's just such a sick joke totally sick because you're an animal
[40:15.980 --> 40:22.860]  and they don't change those gloves on purpose get over here you animal we own you all right
[40:22.860 --> 40:26.380]  that's enough we don't need to show the video again we've already stopped it in full wars.com
[40:26.380 --> 40:32.940]  i said i'd go to your phone calls all i know is i'm driving in this morning
[40:35.260 --> 40:42.140]  and uh get to hear talk radio say oh alex jones yeah i guess he's getting ready for the end of the
[40:42.140 --> 40:48.380]  world see people know to say that right before the day knowing that most people don't routinely
[40:48.380 --> 40:52.140]  listen to the show and they're gonna think oh well he's discredited the end of the world didn't
[40:52.140 --> 40:56.060]  happen and that'll be said all over the country and all over the world alex is wrong the world
[40:56.060 --> 41:00.700]  didn't end and they don't care and they'll edit it together all over the place where i say it's
[41:00.700 --> 41:08.700]  end of the world because in this system being a winner according to the establishment is deceiving
[41:08.700 --> 41:15.500]  people playing you like you're dumb and only when you're unconscious only when you don't question
[41:15.500 --> 41:20.140]  only when you're simple minded on purpose only when you're willfully ignorant can they get away
[41:20.140 --> 41:26.460]  with this on you just like connecticut having the fourth strongest gun laws he tried to buy
[41:26.460 --> 41:30.940]  guns not once not twice not three times we now learn five times the month before he supposedly
[41:30.940 --> 41:39.740]  did it even if you believe the official fable narrative easter bunny story and they went to a
[41:39.740 --> 41:45.820]  victim disarmament zone where the media advertises hey let us give mentally ill people on psychotropic
[41:45.820 --> 41:53.260]  drugs and idea go to schools and kill everybody go to malls and kill everybody and then they get up
[41:53.260 --> 42:01.420]  there in grandstand you know remember bill martyrs the month ago said more deaths good more car
[42:01.420 --> 42:06.140]  accidents more shooting more death it's what i want now he's so sad for the children says ban
[42:06.140 --> 42:12.940]  the guns no he is a knowing establishment member who knows he's an authoritarian posing as a
[42:12.940 --> 42:20.860]  supposed liberal when he is a dripping anti-human exterminist on record and i've talked to multiple
[42:20.860 --> 42:28.300]  hollywood people that have had dinner with this guy and let me tell you he is a nasty little bugger
[42:30.460 --> 42:41.020]  nasty nasty nasty unhappy materialistic worldly uh piece of garbage and again liking material
[42:41.020 --> 42:44.700]  is not bad it's just that it can't be the top of your hierarchy of needs
[42:44.700 --> 42:53.100]  i mean we're in a pickle i have to tell you okay i said i'd go to your calls we're going to go to
[42:53.100 --> 42:58.540]  those and get into all this other news and some special reports and bob bar nra board member
[42:59.580 --> 43:03.580]  will be giving us kind of a first breakdown you won't be officially speaking for the nra their
[43:03.580 --> 43:09.020]  official press conference will be tomorrow but he's a senior member of the board and i hope to god
[43:09.020 --> 43:13.180]  they come out and defend the second amendment because the presidential task force and see when
[43:13.180 --> 43:17.340]  the president comes to you most people like well the president's invited me to you know they're
[43:17.340 --> 43:22.620]  inviting the nra to come and decide what to do to be co-opted so when the president announces
[43:22.620 --> 43:27.340]  executive orders they say well we had you know 10 governors on the governor council appointed
[43:27.340 --> 43:31.020]  because they're good little minions and we had some people from the congress on the president's
[43:31.020 --> 43:35.820]  council but joe biden goes out and creates a council invites everyone here's what everyone
[43:35.820 --> 43:40.540]  has to say then they certify some garbage they've already told us what it is let me tell you what
[43:40.540 --> 43:46.780]  it is a month out before it comes out they won't waste time though i would guess that by the 15th
[43:46.780 --> 43:51.100]  or so of next month even though congress comes in on the 3rd of january by the 15th or so you'll
[43:51.100 --> 43:54.460]  you'll have their proposal they're not going to waste time on this it's going to be banned well
[43:54.460 --> 43:57.980]  they already told us what it is because but they're gonna have a commission though but
[43:57.980 --> 44:01.740]  they're already telling us what the commission's going to say they did this on the 9-11 commission
[44:04.540 --> 44:09.500]  shut down gun show shut down private sales even a father giving a son a gun or grandfather giving
[44:09.500 --> 44:14.460]  a son a gun or vice versa visa v i'll give him my dad a few guns he's giving me a few
[44:15.420 --> 44:21.980]  now he gave me his first lever action 243 savage but that itself is probably killed 200
[44:21.980 --> 44:30.700]  deer the point is is that um till my first year with it the point is is that what was that getting
[44:30.700 --> 44:38.140]  at there there's just so much going on oh yeah they're going to shut down the gun shows they're
[44:38.140 --> 44:42.540]  going to create federal task forces and redouble the money for atf they've already built the
[44:42.540 --> 44:49.180]  biggest federal building in dc's a new atf building they're going to use rules to ban importation
[44:49.180 --> 44:53.660]  and a bunch of other things they're going to go after the ammo with with with taxes on ammo and
[44:53.660 --> 44:59.820]  tracking ammo and they're going to encourage lawsuits against gun manufacturers and they're
[44:59.820 --> 45:06.220]  going to ban the sale period of all semi-autos including hunting rifles because all these
[45:06.220 --> 45:13.100]  so-called assault rifles are just black hunting rifles so that they you know wood gets tarnished
[45:13.100 --> 45:19.180]  and breaks and things in combat that's what they say i personally like the russian style
[45:19.180 --> 45:23.660]  quote assault rifles they are wood that's not really my experience but it doesn't matter
[45:26.780 --> 45:30.460]  let's go ahead and go to your phone calls uh just get ready for it all we told you it was
[45:30.460 --> 45:35.660]  coming oh your conspiracy theorist oh no no one wants your guns no one that's crazy really all
[45:35.660 --> 45:39.260]  these groups have always sworn to get our guns we have all their quotes in the new magazine
[45:39.900 --> 45:45.100]  let's go to your calls uh let's talk to chuck in new jersey police searches what are you on
[45:45.100 --> 45:51.500]  american you don't want warrantless uh having people put their hands in your wife go ahead
[45:52.620 --> 45:58.620]  no alex actually don't uh gotta tell you on the first time crawler and uh i've been listening
[45:58.620 --> 46:04.220]  to you for a few years i've had uh some disagreements about some of the stuff that you talk about
[46:04.220 --> 46:11.420]  there are particulars on the jfk case which i studied intensely but uh but about this situation
[46:11.420 --> 46:17.260]  with the police in the way that this has evolved uh over the years i mean i would say in the 90s
[46:17.260 --> 46:22.300]  when i would be walking down the street in my own neighborhood i would often be stopped as a as a
[46:22.300 --> 46:28.780]  young man and uh and have my pockets emptied and id demanded of me and things like this randomly
[46:28.780 --> 46:35.660]  now this kind of thing has evolved now to uh serious searches actually seizing people and
[46:35.660 --> 46:40.620]  things oh no no no they've had someone got half a million searches a year now in new york city
[46:40.620 --> 46:46.540]  where they just just street searches where they're now pulling pants off women they're now i mean
[46:46.540 --> 46:52.060]  this is the new deal where you line up i'm shoving my hand up you and uh this is the new freedom in
[46:52.060 --> 46:56.220]  fact the new handshake in america will probably become just bending over i mean i'm not kidding go
[46:56.220 --> 47:01.980]  ahead no i got you because i lived in new york city for a while as well i lived on lower east side
[47:01.980 --> 47:07.820]  and that stuff again government wants to put its hands on you it because it wants to put shots in you
[47:07.820 --> 47:14.140]  it's all about medical tyranny go ahead but this but it's about control and it's about conditioning
[47:14.140 --> 47:20.780]  i think because generally this uh this cause can you imagine you know in a historical style you know
[47:20.780 --> 47:27.420]  uh movie like roots if the slave masters were shoving their hands into the women and then going
[47:27.420 --> 47:31.660]  over to another woman i mean you'd be like those horrible slave owners and you would be it'd be out
[47:31.660 --> 47:36.300]  it'd be over the top that slave owners would do things like that but when the police do it's like
[47:36.300 --> 47:41.260]  i mean i heard local talk radio going maybe this is right maybe these women deserve it you know
[47:41.260 --> 47:45.660]  i'm just trying to pull you over pull your wife over all right i'm gonna stand you out on the
[47:45.660 --> 47:50.140]  side of the highway and i'm gonna rape you with my hand right now i mean i mean this is twilight
[47:50.140 --> 47:55.820]  zone level i'm sorry go ahead no i'm sorry i i didn't try to talk over you but the fact is this is
[47:55.820 --> 48:02.380]  what i don't understand is why that so many are taking this uh kind of like this is normal as if
[48:02.380 --> 48:09.500]  this was uh expected this is not this is not right and it has evolved i'm telling you over time i know
[48:09.500 --> 48:15.340]  where and and and this didn't just start recently it's sure they put cancer viruses in the vaccines
[48:15.340 --> 48:22.140]  on record they give children polio the polio vaccine on record uh they they are a group of
[48:22.140 --> 48:27.020]  absolute psycho killers i appreciate your comments thank you good to have you on board with us here
[48:27.020 --> 48:34.140]  folks that's what you don't get out there we have absolutely diabolical evil government at the top
[48:34.140 --> 48:38.060]  and you've got all these idiots below that'll do horrible things because they really think they're
[48:38.060 --> 48:43.100]  protecting us and it's going to get more and more nightmarish until we wake up to the facts
[48:43.100 --> 48:50.300]  mark uh on the uh sandy hook uh convenient shooting for mr crocodile tears obama go ahead mark
[48:51.100 --> 48:56.540]  hello alec well alec you know you'd mentioned yesterday that uh should really send some
[48:56.540 --> 49:01.900]  detectives up there to dig out what uh you know get the facts substantiated but i just wanted
[49:01.900 --> 49:06.700]  to mention a couple to you i i know you've got a whole house full of detectives there basically so
[49:06.700 --> 49:10.940]  i think you're in a good position to do a great well we're gonna hire even more reporters and
[49:10.940 --> 49:16.620]  people soon because we're getting the capital in but we are busy we are slaving i have a great crew
[49:16.620 --> 49:20.860]  just to get the nightly news out and everything every day so i mean we probably should send
[49:20.860 --> 49:25.980]  somebody up to sandy hook uh i just noticed this is happening during the holidays in fact i sorry
[49:25.980 --> 49:32.620]  go ahead yeah i think this is probably a priority one uh type of investigation considering what's
[49:32.620 --> 49:38.620]  going to come out of this shooting but dr bill deagle reported yesterday that uh the sandy the
[49:38.620 --> 49:44.060]  supposed sandy hook shooter adam lanza was found only with two handguns not a bush master assault
[49:44.060 --> 49:47.420]  rifle well no that's what they first said they arrested a bunch of different people and those
[49:47.420 --> 49:52.700]  stories don't check out and then now there's a lot of other suspicious stuff going on and i said on
[49:52.700 --> 49:58.140]  record the dark knight was programming now we've learned they mailed out dark knight t-shirts to
[49:58.140 --> 50:02.940]  random people in new york and connecticut there's an article up at info wars dot com
[50:02.940 --> 50:09.980]  confirmed section of gotham renamed sandy hook in latest dark knight release and then they sent out
[50:09.980 --> 50:17.180]  maps as part of a promotion to media and others saying target sandy hook bane they sent out bane
[50:17.180 --> 50:24.780]  command orders to bane's army to attack sandy hook and by the way adan salazar stayed up all
[50:24.780 --> 50:29.980]  yesterday all last night he has bloodshot eyes to do the research on this and the gothamist
[50:29.980 --> 50:34.540]  newspaper in new york's picked it up people are freaking out over this people were mailed
[50:35.500 --> 50:41.580]  orders from bane kids and people teenagers saying attack sandy hook what do you think of that

[01:01:43.340 --> 01:01:51.180]  that people are not really addressing is what if one of these women or anybody else who's had
[01:01:51.180 --> 01:01:58.540]  the misfortune of being searched were searched after someone else was searched who had an std
[01:02:00.620 --> 01:02:06.700]  well number one in no culture ever did police just pull people over and shove their hands
[01:02:06.700 --> 01:02:11.420]  in their body much less to two different women but it's done on purpose as an act of total
[01:02:11.420 --> 01:02:17.100]  domination and power grabbing and the shameful texas rangers and we're going to have a quick
[01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:21.500]  report on this with their statements uh with david knighten here at the bottom of the hour
[01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:27.340]  they said searches are whatever we call reasonable and so the new york cop according to that who
[01:02:27.340 --> 01:02:32.700]  sodomized a man with a broken room handle till he almost bled to death that is called a reasonable
[01:02:32.700 --> 01:02:37.020]  search by these people as long as they call it reasonable i mean i guess they could move in

[01:02:53.980 --> 01:02:59.500]  course they can't a reasonable search is going to the judge will you guys print me the fourth
[01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:02.860]  amendment or bring me a citizen rule book after the break i'll read it for folks this is not my
[01:03:02.860 --> 01:03:08.060]  opinion the first amendment's not my opinion the second the third the fourth the fifth and they
[01:03:08.060 --> 01:03:13.180]  just tell it in republic oh no no no the fourth amendment says we say it's reasonable to pull

[01:03:18.220 --> 01:03:23.980]  sticking your hands in somebody i mean one thing if the only way you could do this search is they
[01:03:23.980 --> 01:03:30.140]  pull them over and they said i just shoved a cyanide pill in myself then you could in an emergency
[01:03:30.140 --> 01:03:36.300]  situation hold them down taserum and try to get it out of them if you wanted to save their life
[01:03:36.300 --> 01:03:41.580]  most cops is that they're gonna let you die i mean or if someone said they just shoved an eight ball
[01:03:41.580 --> 01:03:46.620]  of cocaine up there you know rare and that could kill them if someone told you i just did this then
[01:03:46.620 --> 01:03:51.740]  you could do that there is no other place or time when you have been adjudicated as a criminal

[01:09:10.540 --> 01:09:17.420]  holly jolly day anyways uh just amazing folks it is not the end of the world and i've tried to get
[01:09:17.420 --> 01:09:21.900]  that out a million times and i knew it would happen this morning let's finish talk radio
[01:09:21.900 --> 01:09:26.540]  locally oh alex jones the world's ending tomorrow i wonder what he's going to do we i'm just like
[01:09:26.540 --> 01:09:35.740]  man that is really a jealous way to act knowing that i've hammered the fact for years the 2012
[01:09:35.740 --> 01:09:41.500]  was a fraud i've been asked thousands of times by people off air and on air what 2012 is and i've
[01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:46.460]  said on air hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of times literally everyone knows my position
[01:09:46.460 --> 01:09:52.060]  forever and doesn't matter i will be accused of this this is just just it's how deceptive media
[01:09:52.060 --> 01:09:57.340]  works people love the trick of like who i'll get one over on jones i'll say that oh the world's
[01:09:57.340 --> 01:10:04.140]  going to end tomorrow oh jones is going to be discredited i mean it's just so weird that people
[01:10:04.140 --> 01:10:09.260]  think they get ahead by being deceptive i i just it's hard enough to be truthful when you're trying
[01:10:09.260 --> 01:10:14.140]  to tell the truth or to get things right i couldn't imagine just going through life making stuff up
[01:10:18.380 --> 01:10:21.100]  we're going to get a special report for about five minutes at the bottom of the hour with
[01:10:21.100 --> 01:10:26.060]  david night in here on the latest on the texas state police say they will stick their hands in
[01:10:26.060 --> 01:10:30.460]  your body randomly pulling you over whenever they feel like it they say that's reasonable so i
[01:10:30.460 --> 01:10:33.740]  thought right now before i got into some of the latest headlines and back to your calls
[01:10:33.740 --> 01:10:42.300]  i would show tv viewers watching an info wars news dot com i thought i would uh simply show people
[01:10:42.300 --> 01:10:48.460]  the little citizen rule books that that we have on video the state police in virginia at a checkpoint
[01:10:48.460 --> 01:10:52.860]  arresting a woman saying this is a terrorist document they swear enough to it but they actually
[01:10:52.860 --> 01:10:59.500]  arrested abby newman um for it's in my film road to tyranny they actually arrest her at a checkpoint
[01:10:59.500 --> 01:11:05.020]  uh when they find it they go that's it take her to jail this is illegal and they sit there in front
[01:11:05.020 --> 01:11:09.980]  of the squad car discussing how the constitution is illegal anyways we also have footage of police
[01:11:09.980 --> 01:11:14.700]  then being taught a training seminar this is illegal so i will send you what they believe
[01:11:14.700 --> 01:11:18.780]  is illegal i actually they swear and oaths to protect and defend this but they're so dumb
[01:11:18.780 --> 01:11:24.940]  they think it's illegal we mail one of these out with every order at info wars uh store.com not
[01:11:24.940 --> 01:11:32.060]  really a plug the point is here is the evil and um you know here's the first amendment and it uh goes
[01:11:32.060 --> 01:11:41.100]  over all of that and then you've got the right to bear arms quartering of soldiers and it simply
[01:11:41.980 --> 01:11:45.260]  breaks it all down with the fourth amendment is in fact let's put up the larger fourth
[01:11:45.260 --> 01:11:53.580]  amendment that you guys uh had uh had uh earlier uh on on screen because i'm actually at the uh
[01:11:53.580 --> 01:12:01.260]  index i want to go to uh the the fourth amendment uh itself uh here on air we'll just do that once
[01:12:01.980 --> 01:12:07.260]  once we have um david night in here in studio i'm going to talk about the fourth amendment
[01:12:07.260 --> 01:12:11.900]  versus they say it's reasonable to stick their hands in you just because they feel like it uh
[01:12:11.900 --> 01:12:18.140]  when the courts uh obviously have to then name the person the place to be searched why they're
[01:12:18.140 --> 01:12:24.540]  searching if you have a warrant uh just to touch someone's person papers or effects but see they're
[01:12:24.540 --> 01:12:30.540]  just gotten rid of that by criminal energy by brainwashing themselves by brainwashing the public
[01:12:30.540 --> 01:12:34.700]  they're just dominating us and now physically violating men women and children with their
[01:12:34.700 --> 01:12:39.020]  fingers let's go ahead and put up the fourth amendment again please the right of the people
[01:12:39.020 --> 01:12:44.140]  to be secure in their persons houses papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures
[01:12:44.140 --> 01:12:49.100]  shall not be violated and no warrants shall be issued but upon probable cause supported by oath
[01:12:49.100 --> 01:12:53.580]  or affirmation and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons
[01:12:53.580 --> 01:12:59.820]  or things to be seized but the texas rangers say sue sue the state police we'll pull you over
[01:13:00.540 --> 01:13:06.220]  we'll put our hands in your body and we'll wear the same gloves and spread you know diseases whatever
[01:13:07.260 --> 01:13:11.100]  these women didn't have any diseases but they've got medical records that one of them got sick from
[01:13:11.100 --> 01:13:18.300]  the other and they um well i mean no kidding you you put first they go in one woman's rectum
[01:13:18.300 --> 01:13:23.580]  then they go in her sexual organ then they go to the other woman's sexual organ and they go the
[01:13:23.580 --> 01:13:28.220]  other woman's rectum i mean the last shot is the woman partially been over with the other woman
[01:13:28.220 --> 01:13:35.100]  just just yeah i mean it's like and you're watching this and they're defending it they're
[01:13:35.100 --> 01:13:40.060]  going to defend put in this enforced labor camps folks i mean you've got to understand how much
[01:13:40.060 --> 01:13:48.140]  trouble we're in i mean look at that just go and edit i mean you can see the force where it's man
[01:13:52.380 --> 01:13:59.740]  man this country is just gone but suspended with pay now because they're like oh you're not buying
[01:13:59.740 --> 01:14:04.060]  we can put our hands in your bodies and again people are like i agree you should do cavity
[01:14:04.060 --> 01:14:10.060]  surgery on the highway but change gloves it's how dumb the public is and again that is outrageous but
[01:14:10.060 --> 01:14:15.660]  you're an animal to them you're scum you're trash like i had an article yesterday well you guys reprint
[01:14:15.660 --> 01:14:21.660]  me how they've got correction court of america now in the schools searching the lockers of the kids
[01:14:21.660 --> 01:14:26.380]  to give them a criminal record so they have a 90 guarantee by the states to fill their new
[01:14:26.380 --> 01:14:31.500]  private prisons to make them money i mean school is a direct feeder directly to prison
[01:14:31.500 --> 01:14:37.340]  okay i'm done ranting i apologize i'm ranting nicole i held you over yet a point to make about
[01:14:37.340 --> 01:14:43.740]  the second amendment go ahead yes well they're going after guns because guns can kill people well
[01:14:44.940 --> 01:14:52.220]  i have a problem with that not only for our rights but uh senators and presidents kill more
[01:14:52.220 --> 01:15:02.220]  people than private gun owners just by voting to do stuff why don't we uh outlaw them well ma'am
[01:15:02.220 --> 01:15:08.940]  listen it it's all about enslaving the public we all know that at least we should and i appreciate
[01:15:08.940 --> 01:15:13.420]  your call let's go to micah florida go ahead sir you're on the air thanks for holding your watching
[01:15:13.420 --> 01:15:19.820]  on prisonplanet.tv go ahead hey how you doing i'm a first time caller i've been listening since i was
[01:15:19.820 --> 01:15:26.540]  about 16 i'm 20 now and i was calling about the gun control debate uh my mom no the other night she
[01:15:26.540 --> 01:15:30.940]  came over and she's she knows i listened to she doesn't like that anyway she came over she's like
[01:15:30.940 --> 01:15:36.540]  what do you think about uh americans on and semi-automatic weapons and i said well absolutely
[01:15:36.540 --> 01:15:40.620]  because i mean the second amendment uh states are pretty clear the rights and rights of their
[01:15:40.620 --> 01:15:45.500]  arms shall not be infringed and she's like well that's she said it's unreasonable for us to have
[01:15:45.500 --> 01:15:51.100]  uh military-style weapons and she's like you think it would be her her argument was do you
[01:15:51.100 --> 01:15:56.380]  think it would be uh okay for us to have uh for a citizen to have a nuke and i'm like that's just
[01:15:56.380 --> 01:16:02.060]  that's just ridiculous well look here's the deal here's the deal and you can go to the FBI's own
[01:16:02.060 --> 01:16:07.660]  crime statistics very few crimes are committed with quote assault rifles uh goons and criminals
[01:16:07.660 --> 01:16:14.220]  like concealable handguns or shotguns from cars because they're not good shots on average okay
[01:16:14.220 --> 01:16:22.540]  and so the mass shooters though are told by the media in school drills that this prozac head went
[01:16:22.540 --> 01:16:28.300]  through and all of it the kids they've proven the dare program teaches kids how to use drugs
[01:16:28.300 --> 01:16:35.420]  they've proven that the sex ed classes uh actually get people to start having sex more often and
[01:16:35.980 --> 01:16:40.220]  teaches people to have other forms of not traditional sex that's what it is
[01:16:40.220 --> 01:16:45.180]  suicide education massively that even abc news has done studies on this and admitted
[01:16:45.180 --> 01:16:50.780]  death education teaching kids how to commit suicide but not to increase suicide so they go and teach
[01:16:50.780 --> 01:16:55.980]  kids about mass shooters all day and then mentally ill people grow up thinking i go get an assault
[01:16:55.980 --> 01:17:02.620]  rifle because that's who you do a mass murder with and then i come kill people and that's basically
[01:17:02.620 --> 01:17:10.540]  how this works and and and once they get the semi autos then they go after you can sit there with a
[01:17:10.540 --> 01:17:16.220]  six shooter with a speed loader and do the same thing you can sit there with 10 round clips all
[01:17:16.220 --> 01:17:21.340]  day and just keep reloading it's totally made up and they're exploiting this they're using this
[01:17:21.340 --> 01:17:26.140]  because they're criminals uh and so i don't know what else to say to people the second amendment
[01:17:26.140 --> 01:17:31.020]  is about military power being in the hands of the people just like the juries the grand juries the
[01:17:31.020 --> 01:17:35.740]  voting we're the government we're the bosses same thing in switzerland in fact i did find
[01:17:36.300 --> 01:17:40.380]  in the citizen rulebook the fourth amendment but but let me read the second amendment here
[01:17:41.180 --> 01:17:45.980]  if we can document cam this terrorist document according to the globalist for everybody
[01:17:47.180 --> 01:17:54.300]  out there yeah just same spot it's right here thanks no soldier shall in time of peace be
[01:17:54.300 --> 01:17:57.980]  quartered oh well they're all over our country now that's posse commentatus basically part one

[01:18:03.740 --> 01:18:10.300]  the right of the people to keep their arms shall not be infringed okay so there you go and then they
[01:18:10.300 --> 01:18:16.460]  define what the militia is it's the whole population and then it goes on here let me read the fourth
[01:18:16.460 --> 01:18:20.300]  amendment the right of the people to be secure in their persons houses papers and effects

[01:18:33.660 --> 01:18:38.620]  be issued but upon probable cause supported by other affirmation and particularly describing
[01:18:38.620 --> 01:18:43.340]  the place to be searched and the persons are things to be seized and i mean i'm gonna say this

[01:26:09.100 --> 01:26:14.780]  this guy um i followed the links on that story that paul wrote this guy this jonathan character
[01:26:14.780 --> 01:26:24.220]  he was uh released from a federal medical center this guy um and i agree um well see sir well people
[01:26:24.220 --> 01:26:29.580]  we don't screen calls the reason they do is people not just calling who are incoherent
[01:26:29.580 --> 01:26:35.340]  they call in people like you who are like bringing up an incredibly complex inside baseball
[01:26:35.340 --> 01:26:41.740]  story where you'd have to go read paul watson's article about fan up uh hoax helps distract from
[01:26:42.540 --> 01:26:47.180]  mass shooters being on drugs i think it's the exact headline uh and then the whole background
[01:26:47.180 --> 01:26:53.580]  of why did new york magazine now new york daily news ran with the fact that the guy's uncle said
[01:26:53.580 --> 01:26:58.940]  he was on this fan up anti psychotic that that is a real drug and can make you go do horrible things
[01:26:59.580 --> 01:27:04.540]  and then we noticed it was pulled everywhere we couldn't find out and paul linked it to somebody
[01:27:04.540 --> 01:27:10.780]  yeah connected to government but uh who'd been in jail i don't but see it's a big ball of wax
[01:27:10.780 --> 01:27:17.660]  rabbit trail it would take an hour to even try to describe any of this to people uh and so uh but
[01:27:17.660 --> 01:27:25.260]  but just without can you put it in a nutshell for people what you're getting at okay uh a bright
[01:27:25.260 --> 01:27:32.220]  part uh story recently said that this guy was uh that that the police had said this guy was not on
[01:27:32.220 --> 01:27:39.660]  meds and there's a suspicious death with bright part as well and also um and they're asking why
[01:27:39.660 --> 01:27:45.660]  then if he wasn't on meds then why wasn't he on meds so this is a figure he was under psychiatric
[01:27:45.660 --> 01:27:50.460]  continual care he was obviously hopped up on a bunch of drugs they don't want that blamed though
[01:27:50.460 --> 01:27:53.820]  because they know that's what's really doing it so they're doing everything they can to suppress
[01:27:53.820 --> 01:27:59.980]  that i'll bet my right arm he was on multiple psychotropic's okay the guy looked like he was
[01:27:59.980 --> 01:28:07.100]  from mars or something textbook fruit loop and then mommy gives him all these guns the anti
[01:28:07.100 --> 01:28:12.940]  psychotic prescribed to adam lanza has a troubled history all its own yeah that's a business insider
[01:28:12.940 --> 01:28:19.980]  and and it links to new york magazine that links to new york daily news so we ran with it and i called
[01:28:20.860 --> 01:28:25.100]  watson actually called me up after we posted somebody else's article about it and said
[01:28:25.100 --> 01:28:30.300]  it's not accurate alex so we pulled it within one hour uh other people have not pulled it
[01:28:30.300 --> 01:28:38.300]  they're just going with it uh and it's just a what are you getting at here it's everywhere why why
[01:28:38.300 --> 01:28:44.540]  is the shady jonathan character showing up at all these shootings um and if the police are covering
[01:28:44.540 --> 01:28:52.140]  up something here what what meds was he on and what does this have to do with with uh well sir
[01:28:52.140 --> 01:28:58.220]  listen this thing they've changed the stories about 50 times the whole thing stinks um it
[01:28:58.220 --> 01:29:03.100]  looks like they've got actors out there what about this i appreciate your call what about this
[01:29:03.100 --> 01:29:09.900]  article right here uh obama meets with influential progressive media on fiscal cliff a week before

[01:33:31.660 --> 01:33:39.020]  i've got to be honest few things have freaked me out as bad as the video that we covered yesterday
[01:33:39.020 --> 01:33:43.340]  and then have been covering in the last hour and a half because i've seen the court cases and i've
[01:33:43.340 --> 01:33:48.940]  seen some other videos out of squad cars that aren't as clear in tennessee in florida in new
[01:33:48.940 --> 01:33:57.020]  york and arizona in california where even male officers go in the pants of women uh in this case
[01:33:57.020 --> 01:34:07.260]  you've got two women uh angel dobs 38 and the niece ashley dobs 24 pulled over by state highway
[01:34:07.260 --> 01:34:13.820]  patrol near irving texas where i'm from dallas fort worth area and you know i i get pulled over
[01:34:13.820 --> 01:34:18.540]  by troopers a couple times a year they're everywhere and it's always something you know you cross
[01:34:18.540 --> 01:34:23.500]  this line you're going five miles over the speed limit they're just everywhere and and i got pulled
[01:34:23.500 --> 01:34:28.300]  over last week by a trooper and i said you don't arrest illegal aliens even for drunk driving or
[01:34:28.300 --> 01:34:32.300]  for speeding and he goes nope i don't like it but the judges let them go but you're been told i'm
[01:34:32.300 --> 01:34:37.820]  open season it's like yep so the point is they they're iron robots where you will let illegal
[01:34:37.820 --> 01:34:42.300]  aliens go and this is nationwide but then when they pull your mother your daughter over
[01:34:43.980 --> 01:34:50.540]  a quote routine traffic stop and what's crazy is first the captain defended it this this happened
[01:34:50.540 --> 01:34:55.820]  months ago now the lawsuit's happened so we've gotten the video as part of discovery and then
[01:34:55.820 --> 01:35:01.100]  the the the head of the texas state police has defended it he's being sued and the texas rangers
[01:35:01.100 --> 01:35:08.540]  said we find the search reasonable now that's a mind game to say we find it reasonable we say
[01:35:09.260 --> 01:35:13.420]  we pull a woman over for flicking a cigarette out our window which is stupid definitely that's
[01:35:13.420 --> 01:35:17.420]  reckless give somebody a ticket that's crazy i still see that all the time even in dry times these
[01:35:17.420 --> 01:35:21.420]  idiots you know like it's the old days you're throwing their cigarettes out the window so they
[01:35:21.420 --> 01:35:25.180]  pull them over for that and say we're going to search your vehicle no discussion of probable
[01:35:25.180 --> 01:35:32.940]  cause of reasonable suspicion you know nothing then they say okay i'm gonna go in your pants boom
[01:35:32.940 --> 01:35:37.820]  and ladies and gentlemen by the end i mean you could see the woman with four shoving her hand
[01:35:37.820 --> 01:35:42.780]  with power and let me tell you there's no way i wouldn't have gotten combative and they probably
[01:35:42.780 --> 01:35:49.100]  would have killed me because i i mean uh i don't want to get into sexual stuff but i'm a married
[01:35:49.100 --> 01:35:53.900]  man with three children you know sex is an intimate thing and it's not just with my wife it's with me
[01:35:53.900 --> 01:35:59.420]  uh i mean if i'm not in the mood for something i don't like people touching me i'm talking about
[01:35:59.420 --> 01:36:04.380]  my wife ladies and gentlemen i'm sure anybody who's married let's just get down to brass taxer this
[01:36:04.380 --> 01:36:08.540]  is not dr. laurus lessinger but we never talk about sex on my show but we're talking about police
[01:36:08.540 --> 01:36:12.780]  now doing sexual things you ever have a bunch of stuff on your mind about business about life about
[01:36:12.780 --> 01:36:16.540]  what's going on family stuff your wife comes over and starts rubbing on you you're like hey
[01:36:16.540 --> 01:36:20.940]  i'm not in the mood i know i've done that i'm just going to be honest about this my wife before i've
[01:36:20.940 --> 01:36:24.940]  been in a frisky mood she's sitting there cooking dinner she's always be like that walk over kind of
[01:36:24.940 --> 01:36:29.420]  squeeze on her she's like yeah i mean i've even been slapped a little not really meanly but hey it's
[01:36:29.420 --> 01:36:33.500]  all right it's like a reflex you do that with these police they'll kill you deader than a hammer
[01:36:34.220 --> 01:36:39.580]  they'll kill you deader than a hammer there's cases where some 84 year old in florida
[01:36:39.580 --> 01:36:44.300]  world war two that i was watching this newscast this morning the officer was telling his car he
[01:36:44.300 --> 01:36:49.820]  put his he said oh please don't do that witnesses said put his hand on his arm body slammed him some
[01:36:49.820 --> 01:36:55.340]  ufc guy broke his neck and the police said yeah that's good so the point is you better know folks
[01:36:55.340 --> 01:37:00.940]  they want to kill people a lot of cops now get off on this they're into a culture of violence and
[01:37:01.580 --> 01:37:04.780]  there's been a lot of cases of police pulling over women that come out of topless bars and
[01:37:04.780 --> 01:37:11.180]  banding service on them or they'll give them a dwi that's happened in austin we are already deeply
[01:37:11.180 --> 01:37:22.380]  into an incredible police state and i just cannot imagine the the police saying bend over and then
[01:37:22.380 --> 01:37:27.900]  put in their hand in in in your body and then going if you were a woman with the same hand and
[01:37:27.900 --> 01:37:33.420]  going in the front and then going to another woman on tape i mean you don't i've worked in large animal
[01:37:33.420 --> 01:37:40.300]  vet stuff you change gloves when you palpate one cow yes folks i've i never really got good at it so i
[01:37:40.300 --> 01:37:44.060]  didn't do it a lot but i'd go out they were checking to see if cows were pregnant you know they put a
[01:37:44.060 --> 01:37:50.060]  big long glove on boom you're going in there to check and see if they're pregnant okay ladies and
[01:37:50.060 --> 01:37:55.820]  gentlemen and believe me the cows don't like it ladies and gentlemen you change gloves on an animal
[01:37:56.700 --> 01:38:01.420]  okay you know the vet sat there every time boom changed glove put another big big you know thin
[01:38:02.220 --> 01:38:08.060]  cellophane glove on to see if they're pregnant to see if the artificial insemination have been working
[01:38:08.060 --> 01:38:14.060]  at these big facilities but that's a side issue the reason i'm going over all this and bob bars
[01:38:14.060 --> 01:38:19.500]  coming up and and david knights here with us in studio is this is the most serious violation
[01:38:19.500 --> 01:38:25.100]  you can have this is sexual assault and i quite frankly am shocked that they're doing this and
[01:38:25.100 --> 01:38:31.580]  now going oh this is routine and the state police are saying get ready so uh you either
[01:38:33.020 --> 01:38:37.420]  have a revolution over this or you leave because let me tell you folks i mean imagine again if they
[01:38:37.420 --> 01:38:42.140]  said nazi germany they were doing something like this and it's all over their stupid phony drug war
[01:38:42.140 --> 01:38:47.420]  the government ships in the majority of the drugs the big banks launder it publicly then they hope
[01:38:47.420 --> 01:38:52.220]  your kids end up using them so they could put you in a private prison now david knight has gone over
[01:38:52.220 --> 01:38:56.860]  this read over this uh and we're also going to go over the fourth amendment here for people but
[01:38:57.420 --> 01:39:01.020]  what do you think of the texas rangers you have their quotes there because they're
[01:39:01.020 --> 01:39:08.140]  supposedly oversee the state police they're like you know uh batman the state police are robin you
[01:39:08.140 --> 01:39:14.220]  know they're the state investigative force over law enforcement what do you make of their statement
[01:39:14.220 --> 01:39:19.100]  that we think this is reasonable and as long as we say it's reasonable it means it's reasonable
[01:39:19.740 --> 01:39:22.860]  when the real definition of a reasonable search is something entirely different
[01:39:23.580 --> 01:39:26.700]  well there's spokesperson is trying to walk that back a little bit now this happened all
[01:39:26.700 --> 01:39:30.220]  the way back in july here we are five months later and this is coming lightly as you said
[01:39:30.220 --> 01:39:35.260]  because discovering the lawsuit but uh the spokesperson catherine sesinger said all troopers
[01:39:35.260 --> 01:39:40.140]  are obligated to act reasonably so as to comply with the fourth amendment of the u.s constitution
[01:39:40.140 --> 01:39:46.780]  as well as the texas constitution now who could think that that was reasonable under any circumstances
[01:39:46.780 --> 01:39:51.420]  and and the problem is is that the constitution gives us a very objective standard for what is
[01:39:51.420 --> 01:39:57.500]  reasonable and what the supreme court has done is to give us a subjective standard right the
[01:39:57.500 --> 01:40:02.060]  the constitution said that you'll be protected against unreasonable searches in your person
[01:40:02.060 --> 01:40:06.300]  especially the first thing that they mentioned because this had happened to them with british
[01:40:06.300 --> 01:40:10.940]  soldiers you know pierce morgan's ancestors had been doing this to people right so they'd moved
[01:40:10.940 --> 01:40:15.100]  into their houses we got a constitutional amendment saying you know troops can't move into your houses
[01:40:15.100 --> 01:40:20.300]  or have a standing army domestically right so they had seen the same types of things that we're
[01:40:20.300 --> 01:40:25.180]  seeing now and that's why these things are in the constitution they violated women right right
[01:40:25.180 --> 01:40:30.220]  so they gave us an objective standard they said it'll not be you know a reasonable search is one
[01:40:30.220 --> 01:40:34.300]  where you are specific about what you're looking for you think you're going to find a crime and you
[01:40:34.300 --> 01:40:38.700]  go before a judge make a case and a judge agrees and then you're allowed to do it they should have
[01:40:38.700 --> 01:40:42.460]  hauled her into jail if they thought they had proof gone before the judge and then if they
[01:40:42.460 --> 01:40:47.020]  weren't right they'd have been liable that's right but what happened is that our supreme court
[01:40:47.020 --> 01:40:50.940]  thinks that they can amend the constitution they act as if they can and they've given us two standards
[01:40:50.940 --> 01:40:56.540]  they say a reasonable search is one where did the person actually expect some degree of privacy
[01:40:56.540 --> 01:41:01.100]  well i think the woman would expect some degree of privacy she said basically they said well we're
[01:41:01.100 --> 01:41:05.340]  going to search you she had no idea it was going to be a search like that but then they also say
[01:41:05.340 --> 01:41:11.500]  as a person's expectation objectively reasonable in other words one that society is willing to
[01:41:11.500 --> 01:41:17.500]  recognize now when you do that what you've created is a sliding scale that is based on society's
[01:41:17.500 --> 01:41:22.700]  moral compass which we see is being changed all the time by the media by the movies that we watch
[01:41:22.700 --> 01:41:27.500]  and by you know just just what's happening in society so now you've you've divorced everything
[01:41:27.500 --> 01:41:31.820]  from you know this this standard where i think a crime is being committed they make the case
[01:41:31.820 --> 01:41:36.620]  before a judge and judge says that's okay now it's just about well what will society accept
[01:41:37.820 --> 01:41:45.740]  and accept this and this is really unlimited what they're pushing i got pulled over by state
[01:41:45.740 --> 01:41:50.140]  police about five years ago i'm 37 going down to the beach with my children this is when my
[01:41:50.140 --> 01:41:53.900]  wife was pregnant with her third child we only had two children then the children were asleep it was
[01:41:53.900 --> 01:42:00.060]  about eight eight o'clock at night and uh the state police came over and were looking at us like
[01:42:00.060 --> 01:42:07.420]  we were murderers and they were wanting to get in to our children's uh car seats and i said listen
[01:42:07.420 --> 01:42:11.980]  here i said you're acting like wolves i said i don't like how you're looking at me you know i don't
[01:42:11.980 --> 01:42:17.100]  have any warrants out you know they pulled me over six miles over the speed limit i said i said listen
[01:42:17.100 --> 01:42:22.940]  you got green stinking teeth and i said i promise you this i am going to sue you and i will make
[01:42:22.940 --> 01:42:26.300]  your life a living hell you give me the ticket you get off my back right now and you get that
[01:42:26.300 --> 01:42:31.660]  witch away from me because i know criminals when i see them and these people were like scum it was
[01:42:31.660 --> 01:42:36.380]  a man and woman two of them and uh and i mean my my ins because usually state police pull you over
[01:42:36.380 --> 01:42:40.620]  they're nice you know deadly do righteous out revenue generating most state police have actually
[01:42:40.620 --> 01:42:44.700]  been nice in my experience but when these people came up i looked in their eyes and i mean they
[01:42:44.700 --> 01:42:50.140]  were they were evil and you know the problem is you've got predators that want these jobs that crave
[01:42:50.140 --> 01:42:56.380]  power uh and who aren't normal people and who look at tsa how many of them are pedophiles and abusers
[01:42:56.380 --> 01:43:00.940]  and all of this i mean it's it's every day they're getting arrested for pedophilia or raping women
[01:43:00.940 --> 01:43:06.780]  in parking lots or you know robbing people and and you know and and one tsa whistleblower said oh
[01:43:06.780 --> 01:43:11.020]  the average person steals like hundreds of thousands a year and everybody i know has been robbed of the
[01:43:11.020 --> 01:43:19.740]  tsa i've been robbed of uh of a uh tiffani baby rattle and dr pochenyx had his sleeping pills robbed
[01:43:19.740 --> 01:43:23.980]  i mean they rob everyone i know has been robbed by the tsa my brother-in-law had his video camera
[01:43:23.980 --> 01:43:29.500]  stolen out of his out of his bag yes so i mean i i mean this is just a criminal force that is coming
[01:43:29.500 --> 01:43:35.740]  up against us and they're protecting the criminals and promoting them uh and uh as you said first
[01:43:35.740 --> 01:43:39.420]  they said this was reasonable that's why they're having to sue now they're walking it back because
[01:43:39.420 --> 01:43:47.980]  of the outrage but i got to be honest man uh i am actually now scared and and and not scared in the
[01:43:47.980 --> 01:43:55.340]  way of i'm scared of the police i'm scared of myself because this enters a whole another dimension
[01:43:55.340 --> 01:43:59.820]  with with daughters and people i mean i don't know about living in this country with my children
[01:43:59.820 --> 01:44:04.220]  but there's nowhere to run is the problem when they're going to grow up and be raped by police
[01:44:04.220 --> 01:44:09.500]  right my son we went to see red dawn and of course the hallmark of tyranny imposed on the people
[01:44:09.500 --> 01:44:14.220]  is the roadside block where they inspect everybody but they weren't going to people's pants they
[01:44:14.220 --> 01:44:18.140]  weren't doing the tsa type of stuff and my son said you know the north koreans treat them better
[01:44:18.140 --> 01:44:23.180]  than our tsa treats people you know it's hard to get scared in a movie when you know they can't
[01:44:23.180 --> 01:44:28.380]  recreate the same kind of tyranny that we see in real life and see exactly but in north korea they
[01:44:28.380 --> 01:44:32.460]  don't have to go in your pants because they won't just disappear you it happens the problem here is
[01:44:32.460 --> 01:44:37.180]  as i've said it's it's a paradox the old republic's still there to extend shot up rotting falling
[01:44:37.180 --> 01:44:42.700]  apart but it's quite a wreckage it's like a mountain range okay and we breathe life into it
[01:44:43.260 --> 01:44:46.780]  and the phoenix is kind of getting up it's starting to flame on if we just get it going
[01:44:47.740 --> 01:44:53.180]  see people die republics can be reborn but we have to admit it's pretty much dead and resuscitate it
[01:44:53.180 --> 01:44:57.580]  with the shock paddles but if we won't admit it's dead and get the shock paddles out i mean we're
[01:44:57.580 --> 01:45:02.940]  flatlining right now on every level we've gone into the flatline and if we don't admit that and
[01:45:02.940 --> 01:45:08.060]  ask for god to strike us with that lightning of liberty to wake us up we're dead and and it is
[01:45:08.060 --> 01:45:12.300]  evacuation time or revolution time and more and more people are talking like that prominent people
[01:45:12.300 --> 01:45:17.500]  mean who know history this isn't a game but just to look at how they've hired police that will
[01:45:17.500 --> 01:45:23.260]  follow any order who have low IQs who will do things like this it is so frightening but there's
[01:45:23.260 --> 01:45:26.940]  a total tyranny if you look at the parallel tyranny it's the worst the world's ever seen
[01:45:26.940 --> 01:45:32.860]  the worst spying the worst control the worst weaponization i mean the most the hitler tortured
[01:45:32.860 --> 01:45:38.300]  people but they didn't admit it they come out and go yeah we we we sexually torture people
[01:45:38.300 --> 01:45:43.660]  we torture their kids and the media is like well that's how you get tough i mean it's if they're
[01:45:43.660 --> 01:45:49.500]  able to fully capsize liberty and then flip in this pure evil it's going to be something like
[01:45:49.500 --> 01:45:54.620]  the world's never seen so what's your take on my statement of these of these two rails this this
[01:45:54.620 --> 01:45:59.820]  paradox yeah well you know i talked to david simpson here is a state representative who's
[01:45:59.820 --> 01:46:05.260]  introduced a bill to rein in the tsa introduced the one last time right right and and and he's
[01:46:05.260 --> 01:46:09.980]  focusing on these sexual assault issues especially now this one has also added another
[01:46:10.620 --> 01:46:14.460]  clause that protects children from being separated from their parents because of what happened to
[01:46:14.460 --> 01:46:18.940]  an autistic boy but you know while the tsa is doing this and actually you know whether it's
[01:46:18.940 --> 01:46:25.980]  by training or by uh imitation or by design now the state highway patrol is doing this to people
[01:46:25.980 --> 01:46:30.780]  i mean we need to have some some it's not just enough to protect us from the tsa this is getting
[01:46:30.780 --> 01:46:35.660]  pervasive throughout all law enforcement and if we don't stop it with the tsa if we don't stop it
[01:46:35.660 --> 01:46:40.060]  with local law enforcement it is going to be pervasive with everybody i mean it's just you
[01:46:40.060 --> 01:46:44.940]  know it's just amazing to me that people would would stand for this uh they're going to have to
[01:46:44.940 --> 01:46:49.180]  people are going to have to stand up they're going to have to take their rights back first is jurors
[01:46:49.180 --> 01:46:52.700]  and we're also going to have to put a lot of pressure on some state representatives because
[01:46:52.700 --> 01:46:56.780]  they're not as corrupt as the federal representatives and we've got some good people in state well
[01:46:56.780 --> 01:47:01.660]  they unanimously after simpson brought it forward passed it in the house the senate had all the votes
[01:47:01.660 --> 01:47:09.980]  but david durst came out and killed it yeah and the fed said we will have an arm blockade with
[01:47:09.980 --> 01:47:15.580]  f16s and it was reported by the dallas morning news like well the feds threatened blockade with the
[01:47:15.580 --> 01:47:23.820]  air force not a embargo i say call that bluff okay and of course why did the house do this
[01:47:23.820 --> 01:47:27.580]  they're all flying and i had a whole bunch of state reps and senators on where they would
[01:47:27.580 --> 01:47:32.300]  describe their wives their daughters well one state rep had his daughter disrobed they i mean
[01:47:32.300 --> 01:47:37.900]  they've had cases in texas where the tsa then asked the women for dates these are such pervs
[01:47:37.900 --> 01:47:43.740]  that they've settled where on video they pull the woman's broth and are going you are hot and three
[01:47:43.740 --> 01:47:48.460]  men get around her and ask her for dates i mean this is how stupid they are too i mean you got
[01:47:48.460 --> 01:47:52.620]  to be really done to be around body scanners all day that are admittedly giving them cancers
[01:47:52.620 --> 01:47:56.940]  these are guys that are willing to die yeah willing to die to be able to grow up people
[01:47:57.500 --> 01:48:04.140]  so they are well this is what every tyranny's done it creates a subgroup of goons that are outside
[01:48:04.140 --> 01:48:08.540]  law that are just federally licensed and then the other police convert to them as the standard
[01:48:08.540 --> 01:48:13.740]  i mean how many times have i talked about listen the tsa is now certifying they're the quote
[01:48:13.740 --> 01:48:18.060]  inspectors over the police at these highway checkpoints absolutely because they're so their
[01:48:18.060 --> 01:48:23.020]  standards are now what's going to happen yeah yeah whether it's by fiat or whether they're just
[01:48:23.020 --> 01:48:26.940]  training the people well hopefully something's going to change with it because david simpson
[01:48:26.940 --> 01:48:30.380]  is really committed to this and there are a few people with with backbone that are going to fight
[01:48:30.380 --> 01:48:35.900]  this uh talk to a representative in michigan who just came up with an anti india a bill
[01:48:35.900 --> 01:48:41.420]  that passed unanimously in the michigan house there so at the at the state level there are some
[01:48:41.420 --> 01:48:47.660]  good honest men with backbone and and women and uh hopefully we'll have enough of them but you know
[01:48:47.660 --> 01:48:53.900]  what he said the guy in in michigan said uh he couldn't propose an india a bill that was actually
[01:48:53.900 --> 01:48:58.380]  going to prohibit and interpose against the feds what he was going to do was keep the state
[01:48:58.380 --> 01:49:01.900]  from assisting them as we're talking about you know yeah and they've done that in 800 cities
[01:49:01.900 --> 01:49:08.140]  for illegal aliens illegally uh but but but the states could ignore the tyranny legally on the
[01:49:08.140 --> 01:49:12.700]  constitutional grounds because the feds are only supposed to protect the borders coin the money and
[01:49:12.700 --> 01:49:17.740]  have a navy they do everything they're not supposed to do though you know my issue is
[01:49:19.100 --> 01:49:22.700]  what do you think you do if you're there with your wife and your children and they get you
[01:49:22.700 --> 01:49:25.820]  out on the side of the highway and it's not up to search your vehicle and they go okay i'm
[01:49:25.820 --> 01:49:29.740]  going to stick my hands down your pants down or they don't even tell you that i mean they'll kill
[01:49:29.740 --> 01:49:34.060]  you is the thing i mean i mean i guess you let them rape you or they'll kill you that's right
[01:49:34.060 --> 01:49:37.660]  well part of it is you know one of the other things is disturbing is how they're using these
[01:49:37.660 --> 01:49:41.580]  tasers as electronic whips to get everybody into submission and that's what would wind up
[01:49:41.580 --> 01:49:45.900]  they would wind up tasering you well they admit that they and if you resist that they kill you
[01:49:45.900 --> 01:49:51.340]  they they they say no it's paying compliance yeah tortures here in america absolutely man i tell
[01:49:51.340 --> 01:49:55.420]  you people think being subservient will make things go easier on them that's not the american
[01:49:55.420 --> 01:49:59.980]  spirit we have lost the american spirit can you imagine the founders were told because not even
[01:49:59.980 --> 01:50:03.340]  the redcoats did i mean they would well they had redcoats that did abuse some women they would
[01:50:03.340 --> 01:50:07.820]  always end up dead i mean can you imagine the founders that they had a crystal ball or looking
[01:50:07.820 --> 01:50:12.940]  down from heaven if they could see women with with people shoving i mean you see that woman
[01:50:12.940 --> 01:50:18.940]  at one point just right into her body i mean this is off the charts i mean there's no way
[01:50:18.940 --> 01:50:24.140]  i would involuntarily strike back and that's terrorism now right and that's what's surprising
[01:50:24.140 --> 01:50:28.940]  about it is that that that behavior is like the response we get from the highway patrol is
[01:50:28.940 --> 01:50:32.380]  well we're going to have to look at this to see if it was reasonable under the circumstances
[01:50:32.380 --> 01:50:36.060]  we're going to have to look at this to see and the supreme court says does society think that
[01:50:36.060 --> 01:50:40.540]  that's reasonable well they're conditioning us to think that anything is reasonable you know once
[01:50:40.540 --> 01:50:45.180]  we get on this subjective standard and saying you know well whatever society thinks is reasonable
[01:50:45.180 --> 01:50:49.740]  is reasonable no what's reasonable is that you follow the constitution which has a very great
[01:50:49.740 --> 01:50:54.700]  job david night look at the pediatric uh the big bioethics board that came out and said kill
[01:50:54.700 --> 01:50:59.420]  children up to age three if society says it's reasonable it's this new thing of well it's a

[01:54:18.620 --> 01:54:23.500]  my friends we have criminals that have taken over the united states globalists they bragged about it
[01:54:23.500 --> 01:54:29.820]  they brag uh in the global credit rate uh rating agency saying hey don't worry the american people
[01:54:29.820 --> 01:54:34.940]  the european people they will do anything we say we're going to authoritarianism that's part of the
[01:54:34.940 --> 01:54:41.100]  financial perspectives i've heard on bloomberg radio i've read in the financial times of london
[01:54:41.100 --> 01:54:45.340]  here's an example and now for world government their foreign editor wrote an article about that a
[01:54:45.340 --> 01:54:50.620]  few years ago that's the headline and he says yeah we're authoritarian we we operate the secret
[01:54:50.620 --> 01:54:56.620]  and now we're taking over we're going to take your freedom we're authoritarians and we're going to
[01:54:56.620 --> 01:55:04.700]  take over and the average cop is just like the average person the public they're a cross section
[01:55:04.700 --> 01:55:10.620]  they're either really smart and patriotic and know what's going on other idiots the problem is the
[01:55:10.620 --> 01:55:15.820]  people above them get more and more progressively criminal and power hungry because the global
[01:55:15.820 --> 01:55:22.060]  controllers will bring up the bad guys this happens this is how a tyranny happens and let me tell you
[01:55:22.060 --> 01:55:30.220]  something that's why now especially you know here in texas when one of these guys pulls me over i mean
[01:55:30.220 --> 01:55:35.340]  this is the most dangerous encounter of your life the most dangerous thing you face in many
[01:55:35.340 --> 01:55:41.260]  areas this country is the police and god help us because they are telling them hey you can do whatever
[01:55:41.260 --> 01:55:46.620]  you want to people and some of the police aren't evil but it doesn't matter it's like russian roulette
[01:55:50.140 --> 01:55:53.900]  i don't know what to say at this point and and and now the system wants our guns i mean
[01:55:55.100 --> 01:55:59.420]  i ought to open the phones up after bob bar leaves for police out there that have seen this video
[01:56:01.180 --> 01:56:08.700]  i mean reasonable would be if you saw somebody crammed something down their pants and then you
[01:56:08.700 --> 01:56:12.700]  could see a bulge and you just arrest them and then when you take a menu find out what it is or
[01:56:12.700 --> 01:56:18.540]  whatever it's not reasonable but see it's all about how we're criminals it's all about how
[01:56:18.540 --> 01:56:25.420]  we're bad and then it's all about drugs that are brought in by the globalist on record i mean it's
[01:56:25.420 --> 01:56:30.380]  just that's why when cops ask me you got any drugs or something man i don't use government
[01:56:30.380 --> 01:56:36.380]  products i don't use prescription drugs i might take a Tylenol if i got a headache do i look like

[02:00:35.660 --> 02:00:43.340]  amendment uh ex vet infantry guy i lost my gun rights but i still stand up for him all i can
[02:00:43.340 --> 02:00:49.420]  i after uh my conviction i lost him like jesse ventura lost his but that's just the way it is
[02:00:49.420 --> 02:00:52.780]  what do you mean jesse ventura hasn't lost his second amendment he doesn't have any convictions
[02:00:53.420 --> 02:00:58.460]  i was i was making a joke down that time he said no i don't have any guns i threw him away
[02:00:58.460 --> 02:01:03.580]  oh yeah yeah well here's my view i say get rid of the 68 gun control act let felons have guns
[02:01:03.580 --> 02:01:07.500]  the old days they give you your guns when you got out of prison i mean you need your guns to protect
[02:01:07.500 --> 02:01:13.020]  you most people in prison are innocent and again cops always say oh that's what all perps say hey
[02:01:13.020 --> 02:01:18.300]  i've never been convicted of jack diddly squat and hadn't done jack diddly squat and so if any
[02:01:18.300 --> 02:01:22.140]  they ever set me up for something it's made up folks i can tell you i don't do anything
[02:01:22.700 --> 02:01:26.940]  and because i'm working all the time there's nothing to do i overpay all the fake fraudulent
[02:01:26.940 --> 02:01:33.260]  taxes i got outside cpa groups all of it because i know they're trying to set me up i mean what is
[02:01:33.260 --> 02:01:37.820]  it a third of death row according to d and dna is totally innocent all these cases are coming out
[02:01:37.820 --> 02:01:43.420]  where they know you're innocent and put in it they even put innocent people like this texas case from
[02:01:43.420 --> 02:01:49.260]  round rock when they know they're innocent and they're a guy with no criminal record and they know
[02:01:49.260 --> 02:01:56.460]  who did the killing i mean it's like it's like with these prosecutors the funnest thing is to
[02:01:56.460 --> 02:02:00.940]  put an innocent person in jail because they're demons and not all of them but look you can't
[02:02:00.940 --> 02:02:06.460]  trust the courts the government's gone i'm sorry go ahead no that's fine i just wanted you to
[02:02:06.460 --> 02:02:10.140]  know jan morgan because she's right down the street in college station the daily caller she
[02:02:10.140 --> 02:02:17.340]  used to be an ap lady and um she uh it's got a couple articles on the uh daily caller and they're
[02:02:17.340 --> 02:02:21.340]  really good articles and she might be someone you might want to have on i don't know what her
[02:02:21.340 --> 02:02:26.460]  old aspect is that she leans neocon or just conservative but on the gun right no no that's
[02:02:26.460 --> 02:02:33.100]  a good idea you know look and i appreciate your call we're gonna go break here in a moment and

[02:02:36.940 --> 02:02:44.700]  um bob bar on with us and when we come back from this quick break but you know i've i've talked to
[02:02:44.700 --> 02:02:49.180]  people on the hill i've talked to a congressman off record and no it's not the congressman we had
[02:02:49.180 --> 02:02:55.260]  on two days ago um jones of north carolina and they they have said that this is the greatest
[02:02:55.260 --> 02:03:01.580]  assault ever uh that we're going to see on the second amendment and um so we're going to get
[02:03:01.580 --> 02:03:07.500]  uh bob bar's take on that we're going to get his take on the tsa and i'm sure because he's a news
[02:03:07.500 --> 02:03:15.180]  hound every time i've had him on he he he's always aware of the latest news uh where the state police
[02:03:15.180 --> 02:03:21.980]  now pull people over and and do cavity searches with the same glove on multiple women front and
[02:03:21.980 --> 02:03:28.700]  back i mean it's incredible it's incredible if i tried to do this to my wife she'd punch me in the
[02:03:28.700 --> 02:03:35.180]  notes and i've got a wife and two daughters i am freaked out i mean if the state police don't get
[02:03:35.180 --> 02:03:39.500]  stopped i don't know if i can even live in texas i mean who would know that texas would adopt and
[02:03:39.500 --> 02:03:46.140]  that's who's been training them um they're the the tsa quote inspectors now and they say if tsa
[02:03:46.140 --> 02:03:51.260]  comes and certifies you we saw this in a federal case where a federal judge ordered tsa teach the
[02:03:51.260 --> 02:03:58.300]  school police uh in new mexico cities santa fe was the first one you can pull this up
[02:03:58.300 --> 02:04:03.420]  to have the tsa at the prom and they see they had lawsuits over groping genitals at the prom so
[02:04:03.420 --> 02:04:08.940]  they said well as long as the tsa certifies you it's now under federal blanket power see they're
[02:04:08.940 --> 02:04:14.220]  saying there's no tenth amendment now and so as long as the feds who are god say you can do something
[02:04:14.220 --> 02:04:19.740]  you can do it that's why obama signed a cyber order and told congress you can't see it uh that's why
[02:04:19.740 --> 02:04:26.700]  he says our military is now under nato control uh that's why they now say that he can shut down
[02:04:26.700 --> 02:04:31.260]  power plants outside of law and and if you see the new cover of time magazine it looks like a
[02:04:31.260 --> 02:04:37.500]  dictator uh photo of obama very creepy and that's what they've told us now that it's not the fake
[02:04:37.500 --> 02:04:44.780]  happy smiley obama we had four years ago we're now going to get the real obama and uh he started
[02:04:44.780 --> 02:04:49.740]  a bankrupt the country collectivize everything ship the jobs overseas uh he doubled the people on

[02:08:57.660 --> 02:09:01.100]  continues to plunge nationwide the media does not want to pick that up that guys that's in
[02:09:01.100 --> 02:09:05.100]  yesterday's stack we pull me those crime statistics or pull them up the violent crime statistic
[02:09:05.100 --> 02:09:10.220]  just keeps dropping for 20 years but the last five accelerating uh so the gun culture is growing
[02:09:10.220 --> 02:09:15.420]  the system's panicking this is the empire striking back canceling all the big hit shows on tv
[02:09:15.420 --> 02:09:20.700]  discovery channel the gun culture has been taking over the the the true gun culture not the one
[02:09:20.700 --> 02:09:25.500]  they're projecting and so the former congressman joins us because everybody wants to know what's
[02:09:25.500 --> 02:09:31.260]  going to be in the press conference tomorrow uh with the nra and so congressman what can you

[02:09:42.620 --> 02:09:48.860]  important uh your many many listeners uh all of them care deeply about this country our constitution
[02:09:48.860 --> 02:09:56.060]  the rule of law uh and certainly uh share with me the tremendous feeling of grief and anger about
[02:09:56.060 --> 02:10:02.300]  what happened to those kids and the adults in in sandy hook elementary less than a week ago
[02:10:03.180 --> 02:10:09.100]  i mean these sorts of things are are terrible tragedies and the first thing we need to do
[02:10:09.100 --> 02:10:13.980]  is is what i'm sure the families want to do and that is to grieve among themselves and
[02:10:13.980 --> 02:10:21.820]  and to take those steps to properly remember those who were who were killed and not do what
[02:10:22.780 --> 02:10:29.100]  others have done namely mayor bloomberg and a number of folks in the congress and elsewhere
[02:10:29.100 --> 02:10:36.060]  and immediately take to the bully pulpit and make a political issue out of this but they have
[02:10:36.060 --> 02:10:40.780]  done that and we know it's going to continue we know that there will be as there already have
[02:10:40.780 --> 02:10:46.700]  been legislative vehicles introduced in the house in the senate and probably some state
[02:10:46.700 --> 02:10:54.700]  legislatures uh to attack the instrumentality of evil and not the evil itself the evil that was
[02:10:54.700 --> 02:11:03.260]  in the mind of uh of this perpetrator lanza and we've seen almost identically in other cases
[02:11:03.260 --> 02:11:10.300]  recent mass shootings uh that we've seen and yet we continue as a society by and large to focus
[02:11:10.300 --> 02:11:17.660]  simply on on the instrumentality uh none of the the laws that are on the books obviously
[02:11:18.780 --> 02:11:24.860]  prevented this this this madman from doing what he did and no laws that could be placed on the
[02:11:24.860 --> 02:11:30.860]  books could prevent this sort of this sort of madness people if they want to do something
[02:11:30.860 --> 02:11:37.020]  like this are going to steal a weapon steal a firearm steal a knife whatever it is get one by
[02:11:37.020 --> 02:11:44.220]  hook or crook uh and what we need to be doing is identifying with the degree that we can with
[02:11:44.220 --> 02:11:51.340]  respect for our constitution uh these people uh there are danger signs and virtually all of these
[02:11:51.340 --> 02:11:57.420]  cases including this most recent one that that should have been heated common sense approaches
[02:11:57.420 --> 02:12:03.180]  that should have been taken uh by his mother by colleagues other family members school officials
[02:12:03.180 --> 02:12:09.500]  and so forth so there's much to be learned here much to be done we are seeing far far too many
[02:12:09.500 --> 02:12:16.780]  of these mass shootings in recent decades uh even as as you just indicated alex uh a violent crime
[02:12:16.780 --> 02:12:24.620]  including a crime with firearms uh is down dramatically uh and this is uh at the same time
[02:12:24.620 --> 02:12:32.620]  as over the last three decades uh concealed carry laws have uh provided uh for much much expanded
[02:12:32.620 --> 02:12:40.060]  that concealed carry 41 states now have shall carry permits uh laws on the books uh americans
[02:12:40.060 --> 02:12:45.900]  do properly understand and and are able to uh to arm themselves and self defense and for other
[02:12:45.900 --> 02:12:54.860]  purposes so as gun ownership by private individuals has increased crime has gone down dramatically
[02:12:54.860 --> 02:13:01.100]  but mass shootings have increased dramatically so there's something deeply wrong here it has
[02:13:01.100 --> 02:13:08.780]  nothing to do with firearms and if we as a society continue to allow our public officials to focus on
[02:13:08.780 --> 02:13:14.860]  the easy target and that is the firearm then more time will go by when we do not deal with the root
[02:13:14.860 --> 02:13:22.060]  cause of this terrible problem well you're obviously a well-read well-traveled uh gentleman
[02:13:23.260 --> 02:13:28.620]  but i want to get your take on this i could say expert opinion in our a board member you name it
[02:13:28.620 --> 02:13:35.100]  but i've studied this problem and in the 60s mass shootings like this were unheard of there was a
[02:13:35.100 --> 02:13:40.220]  bombing back in the 30s in michigan that killed 30 plus children you mean but bombs were outlawed
[02:13:40.220 --> 02:13:44.060]  then somebody blew some folks up it's a famous bombing in fact we can probably pull that up on
[02:13:44.060 --> 02:13:49.020]  the encyclopedia uh for people that are watching on tv but for radio listeners i'll pull that up
[02:13:49.020 --> 02:13:55.180]  after the congressman leaves and cover that i've been meaning to but digressing looking at this sir
[02:13:55.180 --> 02:14:02.220]  we know what the big ingredient is the pentagon developed first person shooter games to create
[02:14:02.220 --> 02:14:07.980]  instinctive killing because in vietnam and before they found troops wouldn't kill people up close
[02:14:07.980 --> 02:14:12.940]  and they would become dead it was meant to hone not a killer instinct but an instinctive killing
[02:14:12.940 --> 02:14:18.460]  you have that all these guys it turns out are first person shooter fans then you add psychotropic
[02:14:18.460 --> 02:14:23.260]  drugs and mental illness uh and they get an obsession with it and then they go out and kill
[02:14:23.260 --> 02:14:28.140]  people and as you said this had some of the most draconian gun gun laws in the country he tried to
[02:14:28.140 --> 02:14:34.700]  buy the guns four or five times in the month he'd been refused and i mean can we stop a crazy person
[02:14:34.700 --> 02:14:39.420]  from hitting a cop on the head with a hammer and then taking their assault rifle out of the back of
[02:14:39.420 --> 02:14:45.580]  their vehicle and going and killing people i mean the media is engaged in all out stampede to get
[02:14:45.580 --> 02:14:52.540]  our guns isn't it time the studies are there sir for the nra and others to point at the real
[02:14:52.540 --> 02:14:57.500]  culprits so that we're not scapegoated isn't it time to go after big pharma with the new freedom
[02:14:57.500 --> 02:15:02.700]  initiative trying to put half of american school children on psychotropic that on their own inserts
[02:15:02.700 --> 02:15:08.940]  admit they cause psychotic breaks and a suicide mass martyr that's that's actually a very good
[02:15:08.940 --> 02:15:15.660]  point your very last one there that has often been overlooked and that is the prevalence of drugs
[02:15:15.660 --> 02:15:24.700]  for children both of teenage years and even in in elementary and middle school and you know this
[02:15:24.700 --> 02:15:31.020]  it's not just a problem that we face alex with regard to mind-altering drugs illicit drugs
[02:15:31.020 --> 02:15:39.260]  illegal drugs these are drugs that children are weaned into by their parents by their doctors
[02:15:39.260 --> 02:15:46.460]  by the schools that are looking to keep to keep children submissive under control and what we're
[02:15:46.460 --> 02:15:52.620]  doing is we're developing generations now since we've been going on really for a couple of generations
[02:15:53.180 --> 02:16:00.460]  generations of children and young adults who are addicted in one way or another to drugs
[02:16:01.180 --> 02:16:06.060]  who have not because they are on these drugs in their formative years that do not develop
[02:16:06.060 --> 02:16:15.420]  uh the social skills for example that you need to operate uh non-violently in society uh and then
[02:16:15.420 --> 02:16:23.740]  we uh you know this this this guy lanza uh it was on that was on drugs and another another area
[02:16:23.740 --> 02:16:30.700]  that we need to look at is why aren't these people being institutionalized why aren't they
[02:16:30.700 --> 02:16:35.740]  getting the help that they need and society getting the help that it's need it needs to keep
[02:16:35.740 --> 02:16:41.900]  these people off the street from harming uh individuals uh this is not just a federal issue
[02:16:41.900 --> 02:16:49.020]  states need to be tackling this as well this character in in Connecticut apparently his
[02:16:49.020 --> 02:16:56.940]  his mother god rest her soul uh was trying attempting to get him into a mental institution
[02:16:56.940 --> 02:17:03.260]  but because it's it's so difficult to do this it's such time it's so time consuming she wasn't
[02:17:03.260 --> 02:17:10.140]  able to and this apparently made him angrier than he already was and of course uh apparently she
[02:17:10.140 --> 02:17:16.140]  kept uh firearms around the house probably not a wise idea not a good move and so because she
[02:17:16.140 --> 02:17:23.340]  made bad decisions and nobody's blaming her she's dead the point is i've got to lose my rights i mean
[02:17:23.340 --> 02:17:27.580]  i got to be honest and and god forbid if i had a son that looked and acted like that the photos
[02:17:27.580 --> 02:17:32.620]  are chilling believe me the guns would be locked up under a you know the giant safe and she reported
[02:17:32.620 --> 02:17:37.100]  i mean it but but again she makes bad decisions now we lose our rights when they have some of the
[02:17:37.100 --> 02:17:43.340]  most draconian gun control laws sir what is the plan of attack to defend the second amendment by
[02:17:43.340 --> 02:17:49.900]  the nra can you give us any foreshadowing on the press conference tomorrow i can't i can't do that
[02:17:49.900 --> 02:17:54.700]  because we have not been as board members we have not been briefed yet i wish i could but i know
[02:17:54.700 --> 02:18:00.220]  absolutely nothing about what they're uh planning i of course can't speak for the nra
[02:18:00.220 --> 02:18:08.780]  but uh i do know uh that as in past tragedies like this involving firearms uh it's very very
[02:18:08.780 --> 02:18:16.940]  important for nra members to be openly supportive of the nra and other firearms organizations
[02:18:16.940 --> 02:18:22.300]  whether it's gun owners of america the second amendment foundation uh we have georgia carry
[02:18:22.300 --> 02:18:28.780]  dot com here in georgia i think it's very important for the citizens to be actively
[02:18:28.780 --> 02:18:35.500]  supportive of these organizations both financially and vocally through letters to editors and calls
[02:18:35.500 --> 02:18:41.580]  to shows like yours and so forth to encourage these organizations to contact and remaining
[02:18:41.580 --> 02:18:47.260]  contact with legislators not just at the state level but particularly at the at the federal level
[02:18:47.260 --> 02:18:54.620]  to make sure that these legislators who will be voting perhaps on legislation like schumer will
[02:18:54.620 --> 02:19:01.980]  likely introduce their support uh feinstein um mccarthy up in uh in the house of new york peter
[02:19:01.980 --> 02:19:08.300]  king and so forth we know what they're going to be doing and what we need to do is we need to arm
[02:19:08.300 --> 02:19:13.660]  those members and senators who understand the second amendment who understand that the real
[02:19:13.660 --> 02:19:19.340]  problem is not the gun but the perpetrator we need to let them know that we the people support them
[02:19:19.340 --> 02:19:25.580]  and will support them if they stand up to this what we cannot allow ourselves to be as silent
[02:19:25.580 --> 02:19:31.020]  so the only voice that they hear is the voice of unreason coming from people like mike bloomberg
[02:19:31.740 --> 02:19:37.340]  i agree and if i was the head of the nra given the press congress tomorrow i would come out and
[02:19:37.340 --> 02:19:43.820]  say it's terrible what happened but i would say it is you know even more terrible potentially if
[02:19:43.820 --> 02:19:48.620]  we let the crime rates explode again like we've had under victim disarmament in this country and
[02:19:48.620 --> 02:19:52.940]  then i would go over the statistics that violent crime has gone down everywhere where you have
[02:19:52.940 --> 02:19:57.500]  concealed carry bringing down the total numbers nationwide i would bring down chicago and new
[02:19:57.500 --> 02:20:01.740]  york with restrictive gun laws having some of the highest rates and i would bring up the fact that
[02:20:01.740 --> 02:20:08.860]  it's time to follow the texas model and have the sheriff train and deputize the principals and teachers
[02:20:08.860 --> 02:20:14.780]  because we have the uh can you speak to that sir uh absolutely and as a matter of fact uh we'll
[02:20:14.780 --> 02:20:21.500]  probably uh at the organization that i'm involved with liberty guard liberty guard dot org uh we're
[02:20:21.500 --> 02:20:30.140]  readying uh an initiative to to get out there and actively proactively support uh what texas is doing
[02:20:30.140 --> 02:20:37.580]  uh and that is to uh to arm and provide proper training for being armed for teachers and school
[02:20:37.580 --> 02:20:43.660]  administrators so that the anybody who might be contemplating at this sort of thing uh will
[02:20:43.660 --> 02:20:49.260]  know that or even if they don't contemplate they may be killed if they if they uh uh try and not
[02:20:49.260 --> 02:20:55.020]  do this sort of thing at another school that happened at sandy hoof uh that the administrators
[02:20:55.020 --> 02:20:59.980]  and at least some of the teachers will have the means constitutionally guaranteed to defend
[02:20:59.980 --> 02:21:05.580]  themselves and the students at that these schools so that's a an excellent idea and one that we are
[02:21:05.580 --> 02:21:11.500]  actively pushing at liberty guard well we've got to get on the offensive because people can say
[02:21:11.500 --> 02:21:16.220]  oh these are these liberals are idiots uh that's why they want our guns they don't understand more
[02:21:16.220 --> 02:21:21.900]  guns less crime as major university studies have shown as the fbis on numbers show england bans
[02:21:21.900 --> 02:21:26.060]  all the guns their crime rate more than doubles i went over all those statistics lowest crime rate
[02:21:26.060 --> 02:21:32.060]  in the world switzerland where you've got to own military weapons by law right you know they've got
[02:21:32.060 --> 02:21:36.780]  bunkers everywhere for the citizens you know with hand grenades and rocket launchers in them uh beyond
[02:21:36.780 --> 02:21:42.460]  that and and you never see it it's insane what we're facing in the seven or eight minutes we've
[02:21:42.460 --> 02:21:50.460]  got uh left here former congressman bob bar is our guest uh roiders and bloomberg uh not just
[02:21:50.460 --> 02:21:56.300]  bloomberg demand but his publications are saying in a roiders article yesterday that oh the president
[02:21:56.300 --> 02:22:02.940]  under law can just sign an executive order or have the atf ban guns under rules well as a constitutional
[02:22:02.940 --> 02:22:07.580]  lawyer i know you know that just because roiders says under law and by the way they don't give a
[02:22:07.580 --> 02:22:13.260]  citation uh obama can do this are you concerned that they're trying to mainline the idea that
[02:22:13.260 --> 02:22:19.100]  well if congress doesn't act obama will and in all his speeches he says we can't let this happen one
[02:22:19.100 --> 02:22:25.020]  more time so that obviously as it happens more as more prosack heads blow their top and victim
[02:22:25.020 --> 02:22:30.620]  disarmament zones they're going to have executive orders uh a what's your concern there what's its
[02:22:30.620 --> 02:22:37.260]  constitutional standing be and what should we do if he tries to have orders as the atf did last
[02:22:37.260 --> 02:22:43.180]  year trying to ban shotguns uh i worry about that a great deal alex i don't think it's uh
[02:22:43.180 --> 02:22:48.460]  it's just some sort of weird hypothetical that you've raised uh we know that this administration
[02:22:48.460 --> 02:22:55.820]  believes uh deeply that uh it can do whatever it wants that is in other words we have a president
[02:22:55.820 --> 02:23:01.260]  who believes that if he believes it's in the best interest of the country uh he can do it he has an
[02:23:01.260 --> 02:23:06.540]  obligation to do it whether the law whether congress has passed legislation that's been signed
[02:23:06.540 --> 02:23:13.660]  that authorizes him to do it or not uh we know that there also are members of congress uh who
[02:23:13.660 --> 02:23:20.540]  support this notion they uh they say well this is a national emergency and just like abraham
[02:23:20.540 --> 02:23:29.260]  lincoln uh ignored the constitution when he was faced with a national emergency in 1861 uh in 1862
[02:23:30.060 --> 02:23:35.660]  so can a president now if they're faced with a national emergency uh do what needs to be done
[02:23:35.660 --> 02:23:41.660]  to solve the problem whether it is an economic situation or something to do with firearms and
[02:23:41.660 --> 02:23:48.700]  even though a president cannot lawfully or constitutionally do what you've indicated there
[02:23:48.700 --> 02:23:54.380]  certainly are executive orders that can and likely will be issued that will have that net
[02:23:54.380 --> 02:24:00.380]  effect it won't may not do it directly but uh there could be uh executive orders that that that
[02:24:00.380 --> 02:24:06.700]  that move at f for example in certain directions uh to start doing certain things that might have
[02:24:06.700 --> 02:24:12.620]  the net effect of putting uh firearms retailers uh even temporarily out of business i think we're
[02:24:12.620 --> 02:24:17.020]  already seeing some of that pressure on some of the firearms retailer no that's right including
[02:24:17.020 --> 02:24:21.580]  a story we broke last year that started in texas remember when the atf just ordered four states
[02:24:21.580 --> 02:24:28.140]  to not sell you know above two firearms to somebody and it wasn't a law they just said oh we just
[02:24:28.140 --> 02:24:38.220]  order you to yeah and and we're seeing i mean i think uh there were two or three uh large retailers
[02:24:39.020 --> 02:24:45.580]  not exclusively firearms but uh retailers that sell firearms that that are uh saying well we're
[02:24:45.580 --> 02:24:52.300]  not going to uh because the liability yeah dicks uh and you know there are some reports that i've
[02:24:52.300 --> 02:24:56.540]  seen that uh this is at least partially with the result of pressure from the government
[02:24:58.300 --> 02:25:04.380]  absolutely that's what the big well i mean look at uh the uh american freedom the biggest uh
[02:25:05.020 --> 02:25:09.100]  manufacturer guns in this country some of the only industries we've got left six factories
[02:25:09.100 --> 02:25:12.380]  they're not even talking about just selling it off now they're talking about maybe just getting
[02:25:12.380 --> 02:25:21.420]  rid of it uh i saw that uh serborus the uh the uh the holding company i mean so this is a i see
[02:25:21.420 --> 02:25:27.500]  them trying to create a coordinated panic and as you said then say well we've got the executive
[02:25:27.500 --> 02:25:33.260]  orders what about this report it's an info wars dot com it links to the chinese people's daily the
[02:25:33.260 --> 02:25:39.900]  official government uh communist chinese uh mouth i mean it's the mouth communist chinese government
[02:25:39.900 --> 02:25:44.940]  calls for americans to be disarmed this just broke it info wars dot com uh with the links to the
[02:25:44.940 --> 02:25:51.820]  people's daily and they say uh they uh challenge obama to to ratify the new un treaty and and
[02:25:51.820 --> 02:25:57.180]  isn't part of what we're seeing the drumbeat even before this sad massacre uh the move towards getting
[02:25:57.180 --> 02:26:03.900]  the senate to ratify the united nation small arms treaty sir uh actually uh alex this one reason i
[02:26:03.900 --> 02:26:07.740]  like to come on to your show because you bring up so many good points that a lot of people don't
[02:26:07.740 --> 02:26:16.220]  readily think of uh and the un treaty the arms trade treaty 18 t uh which is being pushed by
[02:26:16.220 --> 02:26:23.900]  the uk japan uh netherlands a number of other nations mexico brazil uh all of our supposed
[02:26:23.900 --> 02:26:31.100]  allies uh would in fact uh if ratified and it's uh this administration the obama administration
[02:26:31.100 --> 02:26:38.460]  in 180 degree turn from the bush administration has said it supports an 18 t they haven't said
[02:26:38.460 --> 02:26:42.940]  exactly uh what they would support but they support the process so the process has been
[02:26:42.940 --> 02:26:50.540]  moving forward uh it will continue to move forward and the uh it it is part and parcel
[02:26:50.540 --> 02:26:57.340]  of the same anti firearms initiative that we're seeing uh in this country with a uh sort of an
[02:26:57.340 --> 02:27:03.500]  internationally imprimatur on top of it well my issue is i'm of course as a historian a constitutional
[02:27:03.500 --> 02:27:08.860]  lawyer you you know the admiral yamamoto quote about it will be impossible to invade the mainland
[02:27:08.860 --> 02:27:13.260]  and of course he told the military i command this and the emperor and he later made the statement
[02:27:13.260 --> 02:27:19.420]  publicly but it came out during the trials with uh with uh the occupation force there in japan with
[02:27:19.420 --> 02:27:23.260]  macArthur that he said it would have been impossible to invade the united states because

[02:34:23.900 --> 02:34:28.620]  a cover for this in the media like it's okay he's already done it on everything else cybersecurity
[02:34:28.620 --> 02:34:36.140]  military regulations power plants i mean it makes my head spin how much trouble we're in

[02:35:19.100 --> 02:35:25.180]  the crew red linked this place the communist chinese government via its state-run media
[02:35:26.140 --> 02:35:31.500]  zin huv i'm pronouncing that right the people's daily it's called for americans to be disarmed
[02:35:31.500 --> 02:35:39.660]  arguing that the sandy hook school massacre demands no delay for us gun control and it just continues
[02:35:39.660 --> 02:35:46.140]  on from there by the way my voice is not more gravelly than usual just out of the blue i

[02:36:03.660 --> 02:36:09.500]  as we know it when the communist chinese people's daily and their national tv system is announcing
[02:36:09.500 --> 02:36:14.780]  both in print and on television that we should turn our guns in the zin hu is virtually the press
[02:36:14.780 --> 02:36:19.580]  agency for the communist chinese government the organization is subordinate to the state council
[02:36:19.580 --> 02:36:23.980]  will state run media and reports to the communist party of china's propaganda and public information
[02:36:23.980 --> 02:36:32.700]  departments in other words zin hu represents zin hua not chinese folks zin hua represents the
[02:36:32.700 --> 02:36:38.780]  i've heard them reported on the news is something's different but in other words it represents the pinnacle
[02:36:38.780 --> 02:36:45.100]  of chinese state run media whatever is printed in its editorial page represents the opinion of
[02:36:45.100 --> 02:36:52.460]  the ruling communist party leaders the article calls on obama to exploit the tragedy to push
[02:36:52.460 --> 02:36:58.300]  his gun control agenda adding that his lame dup situation represents the best position to promote
[02:36:58.300 --> 02:37:03.980]  it while blaming the national rival association for curtailing uh previous attempts to regulate
[02:37:03.980 --> 02:37:10.620]  firearms in the u.s what do you mean they're heavily regulated nothing nothing we do will make them
[02:37:10.620 --> 02:37:14.860]  happy till they're all gone noting that after previous mass shootings ever since post gun
[02:37:14.860 --> 02:37:19.580]  control measures disproportionately always fail that editorial expresses the desire that the
[02:37:19.580 --> 02:37:26.620]  gunman's cruelty and evil may provide a strong momentum and broader public support for the
[02:37:26.620 --> 02:37:31.580]  restart of gun control efforts yeah they've said that on msb nbc pierce morgan has joked and said

[02:42:52.940 --> 02:42:59.740]  uh jeremy in new york you're on the air go ahead hey alex i'm sorry i looked at those photos of
[02:42:59.740 --> 02:43:04.380]  them slaughtering mainly women who didn't work hard enough in the labor camps it just freaks me out
[02:43:04.380 --> 02:43:09.100]  the apple factories with suicide nets and forced abortions i mean these liberals are just a scum
[02:43:09.100 --> 02:43:14.700]  of murdering hell they're authoritarian trash who want to murder all of us go ahead i mean they
[02:43:14.700 --> 02:43:19.820]  said they want to put us in reeducation camps their religion is raping us i'm sorry go ahead
[02:43:19.820 --> 02:43:25.900]  yeah i i'm actually surprised that the uh the chinese uh you know had said that they uh
[02:43:26.460 --> 02:43:31.100]  you know back when clinton was in office they actually uh you know exported uh you know
[02:43:31.740 --> 02:43:38.540]  many many different types of uh you know ak's you know many assault rifles to the us you know and uh
[02:43:39.180 --> 02:43:44.380]  you know clinton that you know had that shut off at one point but uh yeah i'm actually surprised
[02:43:44.380 --> 02:43:51.100]  that you know the chinese they're coming out against this i hear you uh you you it says you
[02:43:51.100 --> 02:43:54.860]  call them about vets and ptsd don't worry they're getting ready to disarm all the vets too and
[02:43:54.860 --> 02:43:59.900]  you don't like it chinese troops will club your brains out go ahead yeah well yeah what i was going
[02:43:59.900 --> 02:44:06.220]  to ask you about was uh i forgot where i read the article but uh yeah they want to take away uh
[02:44:06.940 --> 02:44:11.340]  you know the the vets coming out of the military you know just coming back from more you know they
[02:44:11.340 --> 02:44:16.300]  want to automatically take away their second amendment rights because uh you know they we
[02:44:16.300 --> 02:44:20.700]  all have ptsd you know we've come back no they just tell you that and they're now telling people
[02:44:20.700 --> 02:44:25.500]  that have a car wreck you have ptsd i'm putting in your chart this will pay for your insurance
[02:44:25.500 --> 02:44:29.660]  and then you get your second amendment taken away they're just going to list us all as mentally ill
[02:44:30.380 --> 02:44:35.020]  that's what reeducation camps are america is turning into a giant reeducation camp
[02:44:35.020 --> 02:44:41.660]  do it is and that was that was a great interview with with bob bar i really hope he and the nra
[02:44:41.660 --> 02:44:46.300]  steps up and uh you know actually actually does something this time you know the what do you
[02:44:46.300 --> 02:44:52.220]  think about i'm not sorry go ahead i i'm just i'm disappointed with the nra and i really have been
[02:44:52.220 --> 02:44:58.380]  for many years god bless you sir look i hope everybody will go to info wars dot com right
[02:44:58.380 --> 02:45:02.620]  now we're going to red link it communist chinese government calls for americans to be disarmed
[02:45:02.620 --> 02:45:09.660]  i mean this is just a foreign government and that's what the un is they're in the un treaty
[02:45:09.660 --> 02:45:14.940]  demanding we'd be taking have our guns taken and obama says he's going to sign it i mean it's just
[02:45:14.940 --> 02:45:20.700]  no end and i'm telling you folks if you had chinese troops and uniforms here the average person would
[02:45:20.700 --> 02:45:25.740]  just beg them to cavity search them because that's a sacrament of america now is to beg to be hurt
[02:45:25.740 --> 02:45:29.500]  by government and as long as it's government the average american just falls down and worships it
[02:45:29.500 --> 02:45:33.820]  because they're not americans anymore and those of us that are still americans we're the enemy
[02:45:34.780 --> 02:45:40.780]  and and and it's just going to get more twilight zone from here uh let's go to gene in georgia
[02:45:41.660 --> 02:45:47.020]  gene you heard that the communist government says they want to help obama uh and that the war
[02:45:47.020 --> 02:45:51.740]  needs to be waged on american gun owners how's that sound actually that's why i called in i've
[02:45:51.740 --> 02:45:57.820]  been talking about this for about a year and a half um me and my husband wanted to adopt through
[02:45:57.820 --> 02:46:03.580]  china a little girl and in doing our research we found out the girls that they had been given away
[02:46:03.580 --> 02:46:10.940]  there has been a basically an off balance of boys for the last few decades and these men these um
[02:46:10.940 --> 02:46:15.500]  chinese soldiers there's now 45 million extra soldiers and i thought it was a rumor 10 years
[02:46:15.500 --> 02:46:19.100]  ago i looked it up they've told them you're going to have to conquer america to get a woman is that
[02:46:19.100 --> 02:46:23.980]  what you're about to say well you know what they're ruthless they're unbalanced they're kidnapping
[02:46:23.980 --> 02:46:31.340]  women over there in china i mean it's just very off balance these guys have no respect for life
[02:46:31.340 --> 02:46:36.300]  and you're right they're ruthless they do things that make a cavity search seem like christmas
[02:46:36.300 --> 02:46:41.740]  morning now the state police in texas will back them well i think the state probably loved to
[02:46:41.740 --> 02:46:47.260]  line up our old families with them it's concerning for me and it has been i have two boys in the
[02:46:47.260 --> 02:46:52.460]  military and i have been telling them for years i'm like you know this is going to happen the
[02:46:52.460 --> 02:46:58.620]  government's going to ask you to rise up against your own people it's official now in in leo 9
[02:46:58.620 --> 02:47:05.020]  through inno in leo 11 they train with foreign troops to take our guns it's official i've had
[02:47:05.020 --> 02:47:10.620]  countless military officers on who were trained at the army war college for gun confiscation this
[02:47:10.620 --> 02:47:16.620]  has been going on for 20 years as they build a secret army against us and how do they do it they
[02:47:16.620 --> 02:47:22.220]  they don't care of 90 of the troops they know they won't do it they take that 10 or so and promote
[02:47:22.220 --> 02:47:27.180]  them and then put them into the homeland security black ops command against america
[02:47:28.700 --> 02:47:34.620]  absolutely and then they secretly ship all 3000 more away from home and i think that was what
[02:47:34.620 --> 02:47:40.780]  obama did this what just recently shipped another 3000 of our own our own boys and women um you
[02:47:40.780 --> 02:47:44.140]  know you know you know what's going to happen when all this starts unfolding because this is the
[02:47:44.140 --> 02:47:48.060]  plan people are going to not believe we warned them but here's going to be the good news people
[02:47:48.060 --> 02:47:52.620]  who don't believe all this is happening once it really starts happening they'll now know the whole
[02:47:52.620 --> 02:47:57.660]  blueprint okay so that's what we're doing right now just trying to warn as many people as we can
[02:47:57.660 --> 02:48:02.460]  a lot of them will laugh but down the road they'll remember and know the rest of the plan go ahead
[02:48:02.460 --> 02:48:06.380]  and they'll know submitting because they're going to tell you now our friends are here to fight the
[02:48:06.380 --> 02:48:11.260]  insurrectionist just submit to our foreign european union friends that's who the main force
[02:48:11.260 --> 02:48:18.460]  they're training chinese later chinese government and uh everything will be fine people will know
[02:48:18.460 --> 02:48:22.700]  when you submit to the full foreign takeover that's when they're going to take you and kill you go
[02:48:22.700 --> 02:48:27.580]  ahead well absolutely they're chipping away at the corner store our cornerstone the second
[02:48:27.580 --> 02:48:33.020]  amendment everything else will follow the wayside i'm even shocked um during the national idea act
[02:48:33.020 --> 02:48:39.900]  of 2004 2005 i think that one was stuck under the tsunami relief bill i saw this comment georgia
[02:48:39.900 --> 02:48:45.340]  just calls it now the secure idea act where they heard you in the dmv and they take all your information
[02:48:45.340 --> 02:48:50.620]  and link it and if you know in dc they're now taking blood in the district of criminals when you
[02:48:50.620 --> 02:48:56.380]  get a driver's license and of course bill clinton signed an executive order to do that um but uh it
[02:48:56.380 --> 02:48:59.980]  took a long time for it to be implemented but it's starting god bless you ma'am folks
[02:49:02.060 --> 02:49:07.820]  reality is insane and i just wish people would wake up how much grave danger we're in the communist
[02:49:07.820 --> 02:49:12.540]  government is saying that you know obama get their guns wage war on them these are quotes
[02:49:13.740 --> 02:49:18.540]  they love him he says here's their comrade uh that is the leadership the people in china hate
[02:49:18.540 --> 02:49:26.620]  their corrupt government brian in texas go ahead can you hear me yes i can sir go ahead uh yes sir
[02:49:26.620 --> 02:49:32.780]  uh i got one comment and i got two important things to put out to you uh her comment was
[02:49:32.780 --> 02:49:39.180]  about the uh the way he's taking on the dps that used to work for one of the state departments
[02:49:39.180 --> 02:49:46.700]  in texas for 17 years and the corruption it's just mind blowing from the government on down
[02:49:46.700 --> 02:49:52.220]  it's just phenomenal the only way for anybody regardless if you're an employee or a citizen
[02:49:52.220 --> 02:49:58.700]  to be right is unfortunate you have to be uh ready to take an import and that's all that's it
[02:49:58.700 --> 02:50:03.500]  they they as long you can do whatever you want as long as you follow every order you're given and
[02:50:04.620 --> 02:50:08.540]  just all of government is just stealing money doing whatever they wanted every level it is
[02:50:09.500 --> 02:50:15.260]  we're going down i mean we the country has cancer and all i hope is we can fix it down the road but

[02:55:06.140 --> 02:55:12.460]  remember this a few years ago it reminded me that youtube took down most of the uh state-run media
[02:55:12.460 --> 02:55:16.940]  chinese murdering and shooting and running over peaceful protesters at tienna mon we're able to
[02:55:16.940 --> 02:55:23.020]  find some of it just type in tm and scare massacre tenement square massacre and uh you got to dig
[02:55:23.020 --> 02:55:28.620]  through it some of the other video sites still have it but youtube uh they're comrades they're
[02:55:28.620 --> 02:55:34.460]  comrades uh and so they don't take off al-qaeda killing videos because that's the cia and global
[02:55:34.460 --> 02:55:39.660]  of staging most that that's used to attack the middle east but they will take down uh china

[03:02:43.900 --> 03:02:50.780]  is designed around a frontal assault okay but they don't see a one-man info weapon assault or a small
[03:02:50.780 --> 03:02:56.700]  team assault as a threat so their defense isn't built around that i'm telling you go do a banner
