[00:00.000 --> 00:23.000]  George Soros is banned in his home country of Hungary, the Philippines, Turkey, Russia,
[00:23.000 --> 00:28.560]  Poland and Pakistan, but his presence in the United States and more importantly its elections
[00:28.560 --> 00:30.040]  couldn't be stronger.
[00:30.040 --> 00:36.480]  During the 2016 presidential elections, we discovered that Lord Mark Malik Brown, chairman
[00:36.480 --> 00:41.760]  of the company Smartmatics, which caused voting machine chaos in countries all over
[00:41.760 --> 00:47.040]  the world, served on Soros' Open Society Foundation's global board.
[00:47.040 --> 00:54.280]  Not satisfied with simply rigging the voting machines, Soros is renting Christian evangelicals
[00:54.280 --> 00:58.680]  as the Washington Times reported, and the National Review reported all the way back
[00:58.680 --> 01:06.360]  in 2010 that the progressive evangelical organization Sojourners, headed by Jim Wallace, had received
[01:06.360 --> 01:11.040]  grants from the Open Society Institute, the foundation of left-wing billionaire George
[01:11.040 --> 01:12.040]  Soros.
[01:12.040 --> 01:17.640]  Is it any wonder that Christianity Today, which wrote a glowing article of Soros' immigration
[01:17.640 --> 01:21.760]  strategy, savagely attacked President Trump?
[01:21.760 --> 01:27.280]  Even as when does his behavior, which is described as immoral accurately, rise to the
[01:27.280 --> 01:31.040]  level where he's no longer fit to serve office?
[01:31.040 --> 01:35.000]  And to me, we cross that line with the impeachment hearings.
[01:35.000 --> 01:39.840]  So it's better late than never that Attorney General Barr is commenting on the damage to
[01:39.840 --> 01:45.560]  our criminal justice system that Soros-backed district attorneys are waging across the United
[01:45.560 --> 01:46.560]  States.
[01:46.560 --> 01:53.240]  What's stuck in your piece about social justice DAs, and you put social justice in quotes.
[01:53.240 --> 01:54.240]  What do you mean by that?
[01:54.240 --> 01:55.240]  What does that mean?
[01:55.240 --> 01:56.240]  Social justice DAs?
[01:56.240 --> 02:03.080]  Well, there's been this recent development where George Soros has been coming in largely
[02:03.080 --> 02:08.520]  in democratic primaries, where there's not going to be much voter turnout, and putting
[02:08.520 --> 02:15.800]  in a lot of money to elect people who are not very supportive of law enforcement.
[02:15.800 --> 02:24.120]  And don't view the office as bringing to trial and prosecuting criminals, but pursuing
[02:24.120 --> 02:26.120]  other social agendas.
[02:26.120 --> 02:31.440]  And they have started to win in a number of cities, and they have, in my view, not given
[02:31.440 --> 02:35.040]  the proper support to the police.
[02:35.040 --> 02:41.080]  And they're following policies that are ultimately going to lead to an increase in violent crime
[02:41.080 --> 02:42.440]  and more victims.
[02:42.440 --> 02:47.600]  The pushback on Rudy Giuliani's investigation into Soros and the Obama administration's
[02:47.600 --> 02:52.560]  back ties in the Ukraine has been branded a bumbling scavenger hunt.
[02:52.560 --> 02:57.720]  But as the Hill previously reported, it turns out that the group that Ukrainian law enforcement
[02:57.720 --> 03:03.960]  was probing was co-founded by the Obama administration and liberal mega donor George Soros.
[03:03.960 --> 03:09.900]  And it was collaborating with the FBI agents investigating then-Trump campaign manager
[03:09.900 --> 03:14.880]  Paul Manafort's business activities with pro-Russian figures in Ukraine.
[03:14.880 --> 03:21.520]  The implied message to Ukraine's prosecutors was clear, don't target ANT-AC, the Anti-Corruption
[03:21.520 --> 03:26.320]  Action Center, in the middle of an American presidential election in which Soros was backing
[03:26.320 --> 03:31.160]  Hillary Clinton to succeed another Soros favorite, Barack Obama.
[03:31.160 --> 03:35.720]  Ukrainian officials added, we ran right into a buzzsaw and we got bloodied.
[03:35.720 --> 03:40.840]  How's that for subverting supposed free and fair elections in the United States?
[03:40.840 --> 03:45.240]  If we are to take our national elections, our government, and our criminal justice
[03:45.240 --> 03:51.760]  system seriously, George Soros, who continues an unyielding subversion of our republic with
[03:51.760 --> 03:57.640]  all of his dark money streams, must find himself banned in the United States as well.
[03:57.640 --> 04:02.600]  Otherwise, the Democrats, with all of their obstruction and abuses of power, in league
[04:02.600 --> 04:08.160]  with the mockingbird media, will continue to deflect all of the blame on a duly elected
[04:08.160 --> 04:36.400]  president that did nothing wrong.
[04:36.400 --> 05:00.720]  It's your last chance
[05:00.720 --> 05:25.400]  to
[05:25.400 --> 05:52.080]  get
[05:52.080 --> 06:15.580]  the
[06:15.580 --> 06:22.360]  stop tyranny will so does he live from the info wars dot com studios it's Alex
[06:22.360 --> 06:38.240]  Jones I made a promise to you on air and I intend to keep it I made a promise
[06:38.240 --> 06:43.840]  to my family and my friends and my neighbors my community and I intend to
[06:43.840 --> 06:52.260]  keep it I made a promise to myself and I intend to keep it but I'll tell you I
[06:52.260 --> 06:58.700]  really made a promise to you a long time ago and I was God I've experienced
[06:58.700 --> 07:09.220]  God's presence and I keep my personal experiences to myself at least for now
[07:09.220 --> 07:21.220]  but I take that pledge to God very very serious but it's in pledging yourself to
[07:21.220 --> 07:29.860]  a worthy cause that God is able to enter your life because God isn't a rapist like
[07:29.860 --> 07:43.180]  the devil and the Bible and Christ talks about we are the bride and God is the
[07:43.180 --> 07:51.460]  groom and to say that it's physically sexual is not correct but it is
[07:51.460 --> 08:07.740]  spiritual union with God and a marriage just as Adam created Eve God
[08:07.740 --> 08:14.380]  created us so that God would not be lonely in the universe it's all hidden
[08:14.380 --> 08:26.500]  right there on the face of it but the profane can understand it and they work
[08:26.500 --> 08:37.140]  around the clock trying to keep you from learning those secrets I'm really proud
[08:37.140 --> 08:44.580]  of this whole crew they're present they're conscious they're focused but my
[08:44.580 --> 08:48.540]  greatest frustration is that we have so much incredible information and then we
[08:48.540 --> 08:52.300]  we get it out but then if we don't promote it and if we don't point out
[08:52.300 --> 08:57.060]  how important it is you don't promote it and point out how important it is and
[08:57.060 --> 09:03.740]  it dies on the vine because as much as I love our core audience you're the jump
[09:03.740 --> 09:09.180]  point to everybody else to win this fight you're the gun with the bullets
[09:09.180 --> 09:15.420]  loaded in it info wars is the ammunition you are the gun you are the
[09:15.420 --> 09:20.500]  artillery you're the missile launcher you're the particle beam you're the
[09:20.500 --> 09:32.500]  bomber you fire the weapon the truth that's why I'm always trying to explain
[09:32.500 --> 09:37.140]  hey you're really critical hey you're as important as I am or more that's not to
[09:37.140 --> 09:44.340]  make you feel important it's because you are important and so I see these
[09:44.340 --> 09:49.060]  reports like the one John Bowne just put out that's only on banned out video in
[09:49.060 --> 09:54.340]  the John Bowne section it needs to be shared everywhere banned Soros from the
[09:54.340 --> 10:04.740]  USA by the way he's banned in a whole bunch of countries look at those reports
[10:04.740 --> 10:08.380]  those need to get out to everybody
[10:10.220 --> 10:15.420]  those are bullets politically spiritually that need to be fired at the
[10:15.420 --> 10:20.220]  enemy and you do that by getting them out to people that don't know what's
[10:20.220 --> 10:25.740]  going on when Fox News even tries to have judicial watch on Lou Dobbs they go
[10:25.740 --> 10:29.060]  hey he still has these people in the State Department here's their names and
[10:29.060 --> 10:31.980]  they're still getting five million dollars a year on average to fund
[10:31.980 --> 10:37.340]  international operations and then to work against America's interest Fox News
[10:37.340 --> 10:43.460]  threatened to fire Dobbs they threatened to cancel a show they they said we'll
[10:43.460 --> 10:47.460]  never have judicial watches head on again because what he said was true it's
[10:47.460 --> 10:59.180]  what we were saying so if you ever say the truth it's game over that's why when
[10:59.180 --> 11:06.060]  the Attorney General came out on Fox News three days ago they did an interview a
[11:06.060 --> 11:10.980]  week ago but they've been doling out the clips when they released the second
[11:10.980 --> 11:22.660]  tranche of the interview this weekend last weekend he said Soros is basically
[11:22.660 --> 11:27.740]  putting district attorneys in so they can have organized crime takeover which is
[11:27.740 --> 11:32.940]  true which is outrageous which is sensational so it's those great truths
[11:32.940 --> 11:37.100]  that aren't supposed to be said they're trying to shut us down namely for
[11:37.100 --> 11:41.540]  exposing Soros and now the Attorney General is doing it you don't just
[11:41.540 --> 11:45.300]  think he's saying that for no reason he knows exactly what he's doing just like
[11:45.300 --> 11:48.980]  what he called Comey a liar last week and said Comey ran the illegal
[11:48.980 --> 11:56.100]  investigations and perjured himself to Congress we all know that but to have the
[11:56.100 --> 12:01.420]  Attorney General say it lets you know they are preparing to take action he
[12:01.420 --> 12:05.420]  also said last week that they're preparing criminal action against big
[12:05.420 --> 12:09.220]  tech that they may not go with the anti-trust and of course they know the
[12:09.220 --> 12:14.900]  crimes they've been committing stealing advertising money spying on people
[12:14.900 --> 12:20.300]  illegally inflating numbers
[12:25.860 --> 12:35.300]  so the fight's on now my frustration is we get behind we have a piece about
[12:35.300 --> 12:39.220]  homeless being confirmed to be micro chipped that we've just been so busy
[12:39.220 --> 12:42.220]  adding some things to and some research we have an air should have been out two
[12:42.220 --> 12:45.460]  weeks ago nobody's fault
[12:46.620 --> 12:55.780]  plus another pin somehow it keeps happening on my hand so we have all
[12:55.780 --> 12:59.380]  those big developments unfolding
[12:59.380 --> 13:07.140]  we are going to release either late tonight I'm not gonna sit on this or
[13:07.140 --> 13:17.220]  tomorrow morning the next big information deluge on Jeffrey Epstein and
[13:17.220 --> 13:21.140]  just as we've been trailblazers on that from beginning we are going to trail
[13:21.140 --> 13:26.980]  blaze the new big path into the ongoing media cover-up the same
[13:26.980 --> 13:32.900]  organizations and groups engage in the same type of procurement and just
[13:32.900 --> 13:41.020]  exactly what Epstein really was doing and what he's a window into I'm going to
[13:41.020 --> 13:46.620]  tape this special report this afternoon and then if it's ready tonight I'm a
[13:46.620 --> 13:53.860]  staffer late tonight with the individual I'm putting it together with Rob do and
[13:53.860 --> 14:02.060]  the whistleblower and then we're either going to release it tonight or early
[14:02.060 --> 14:10.860]  tomorrow morning then we've shot over three days a big vaccine danger special

[14:29.900 --> 14:34.140]  everyone you know because it's what they don't want you to know cut and dry total
[14:34.140 --> 14:39.500]  proof that the vaccines are being spiked by design on purpose as population
[14:39.500 --> 14:45.900]  control that is coming up so today we just posted part one of the Clinton body

[17:21.860 --> 17:25.340]  east bank of the Mississippi because of the flooding we've had to move a lot of
[17:25.340 --> 17:28.980]  our inventory to a temporary location and rather than move it back to the
[17:28.980 --> 17:31.900]  warehouse we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem
[17:31.900 --> 17:35.980]  unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwaters backstory so here's what you

[21:27.540 --> 21:32.900]  with the family but other time getting other projects done and completed and
[21:32.900 --> 21:39.980]  I'll be back Friday live we're live right now and there'll be other reports
[21:39.980 --> 21:44.660]  coming out as well and if big events take place you just go to info wars I'll
[21:44.660 --> 21:56.260]  be live one way or another because we're living in a quickening right now now I
[21:56.260 --> 22:01.060]  want to cover some of the contemporaneous news when we come back but I
[22:01.060 --> 22:16.380]  just want to finish up here speaking to something the establishment knows they
[22:16.380 --> 22:22.580]  can't hide the evil things they're into that they do and so they want to
[22:22.580 --> 22:27.660]  normalize all of it and that's what you see desperately going on with infanticide
[22:27.660 --> 22:35.820]  and pedophilia and Satanism being mainline is because they know there's a
[22:35.820 --> 22:41.100]  big pushback against them and they're just trying to condition us to accept it
[22:41.100 --> 22:49.740]  that's why it's critical that this broadcast particularly never act as a
[22:49.740 --> 22:55.140]  desensitizer they miscalculated many years ago and I've confirmed this and
[22:55.140 --> 22:58.940]  they've admitted it because they believe my broadcast was acting as a
[22:58.940 --> 23:05.140]  desensitizer and they believe that I would scare people by telling them the
[23:05.140 --> 23:09.900]  truth but at a limited scale not that I was limiting the truth but that it
[23:09.900 --> 23:15.420]  wasn't getting out on what they saw as a credible national scale so they believe
[23:15.420 --> 23:18.420]  it would psychologically inoculate people to not think it was a big deal
[23:18.420 --> 23:23.140]  when it officially came out and they thought I would scare people that were
[23:23.140 --> 23:29.100]  in the know who weren't part of it to then not oppose it well I believe people
[23:29.100 --> 23:33.620]  had courage I believe people cared about their children I believe people were
[23:33.620 --> 23:39.860]  just distracted and busy and asleep and that if you were told the truth you were
[23:39.860 --> 23:42.700]  gonna be just like me and get pissed off and angry I want to do something about
[23:42.700 --> 23:51.140]  it and of course I bet on your red blood and I bet right didn't I you know it
[23:51.140 --> 23:55.260]  was 3% started and saw through the Revolutionary War against the Empire
[23:55.260 --> 24:02.060]  never been defeated ladies and gentlemen we've probably got 30% of the public
[24:02.060 --> 24:10.820]  it's hardcore aware now and know how the system works it was probably 10% five
[24:10.820 --> 24:19.340]  years ago when you got 30% aware of what's going on if they decide to move
[24:19.340 --> 24:28.100]  and take action economically militarily spiritually it's over so I'm gonna
[24:28.100 --> 24:33.140]  explain something here this isn't this isn't an overly positive statement it's
[24:33.140 --> 24:41.180]  truth we have won and we won back at Calvary with Jesus Christ when God took
[24:41.180 --> 24:50.740]  on our sins and sacrifice and gave us an example to live by but we've really won
[24:50.740 --> 24:54.940]  now and the globalists know that they just want to take as many innocent
[24:54.940 --> 24:59.700]  people with them as they can as many souls
[25:01.660 --> 25:08.100]  unless we just get normalized that okay all this devil worship and evil stuff's
[25:08.100 --> 25:14.580]  going on in Satanism and then we don't do anything about it if it just comes out
[25:14.580 --> 25:18.740]  in the open and then nothing happens to them well then they could grab victory
[25:18.740 --> 25:26.900]  from the jaws of defeat and that's why they're putting satanic altars at major
[25:26.900 --> 25:33.540]  capitals that's why they're teaching all the occultism in schools saying you
[25:33.540 --> 25:38.180]  can't hand out Christmas cards that's why they're saying mothers and fathers are
[25:38.180 --> 25:43.460]  a bad word that's why the ACLU is pushing for tampon machines at all men's
[25:43.460 --> 25:47.740]  bathrooms it's an overthrow of common sense and reality and that's why I'm
[25:47.740 --> 25:52.500]  not gonna do it again today I did it yesterday I'm not gonna air five minute
[25:52.500 --> 25:59.100]  compilations of mainstream TV saying kill babies it's fun it's a it's a
[25:59.100 --> 26:04.100]  empowering for women it'll make you God we do it for Satan they're not doing
[26:04.100 --> 26:07.460]  that to just shock us they're doing that to overwhelm us because they know
[26:07.460 --> 26:14.620]  that's coming out but I can show you all the feminist magazines and the
[26:14.620 --> 26:19.580]  universities saying it's sexually pleasurable to kill your child which of
[26:19.580 --> 26:30.180]  course it's not increases cancer risk it's fun it makes you God I could sit
[26:30.180 --> 26:35.300]  there and put this up on screen the so-called trainee that simulates
[26:35.300 --> 26:41.060]  murdering babies and as a witch in a satanism coven and then this gets
[26:41.060 --> 26:52.220]  promoted by the left and funded by city programs in New York this is cancer and
[26:52.220 --> 26:59.980]  it wants to normalize itself to you but here is Michelle Wolf in her latest
[26:59.980 --> 27:04.620]  event on stage in front of a couple thousand people cheering talking about
[27:04.620 --> 27:10.900]  a mother killing her baby so that she has power in place God there's never
[27:10.900 --> 27:17.780]  been a more satanically pure statement made this is the definition of Satanism
[27:17.780 --> 27:21.820]  here it is you know we talked about it so negatively that you feel like you
[27:21.820 --> 27:25.820]  should have this sense of shame after you get an abortion well you can feel
[27:25.820 --> 27:32.900]  any way you want after you get an abortion get one see how you feel you
[27:32.900 --> 27:38.380]  know my abortion made me feel very powerful you know people say you can't
[27:38.380 --> 27:40.860]  play God
[27:51.580 --> 27:58.380]  don't knock it till you try it really knock it you know you gotta get that
[27:58.380 --> 28:08.260]  baby out of there normalizing that a mother's power is killing her baby
[28:08.260 --> 28:12.980]  for her own satanic selfishness and enjoying it and cheering it and then
[28:12.980 --> 28:19.900]  having men poses women and take over the powerful role the magic role of the
[28:19.900 --> 28:25.540]  woman and in saying in that role I kill babies this is a religion this is what
[28:25.540 --> 28:31.220]  goes on in these cults of selfishness because it imagine how selfish you got
[28:31.220 --> 28:37.580]  to be the torture of a baby to death to rape it to drink its blood and boy you
[28:37.580 --> 28:42.060]  feel powerful they say after you do it no you you feel damned and cut off from
[28:42.060 --> 28:46.780]  God and that's why these enemies want to shut us down so that when they try to
[28:46.780 --> 28:50.780]  normalize all this we can't call out the elephant in the room but because of you

[30:01.220 --> 30:05.620]  the globalists think America's done the globalists think the West has done they
[30:05.620 --> 30:09.220]  think that Christians are done and finished they believe they've broken
[30:09.220 --> 30:13.580]  our backs they believe that with big tech censorship will just crawl into
[30:13.580 --> 30:17.500]  dishes and submit to them and they believe that if they can demonize and
[30:17.500 --> 30:21.580]  shut down info wars that they rightfully see as a symbol of beacon of
[30:21.580 --> 30:24.980]  populism and freedom not just to America but to the whole world that they
[30:24.980 --> 30:28.900]  could demoralize everybody else and win while they can shut info wars down they

[32:54.300 --> 33:22.820]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show you are listening to an infowars.com
[33:22.820 --> 33:29.340]  front-line report if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[33:33.340 --> 33:43.900]  I once had an off-record discussion with the head of one of the four largest
[33:43.900 --> 33:49.020]  banks in the United States and I'm not gonna tell the whole story again I've
[33:49.020 --> 33:56.900]  told it many times but that was probably wasn't probably that was about 14 years
[33:56.900 --> 34:06.060]  ago and what they told me I already knew but I didn't understand that it was the
[34:06.060 --> 34:10.900]  foundation of everything they've launched against us and it's what I was
[34:10.900 --> 34:18.940]  just covering last segment how they're going yeah we we kill babies because we
[34:18.940 --> 34:24.940]  enjoy it and they are humans and we love snuffing out their whole future and
[34:24.940 --> 34:34.140]  stealing the essence of their life force and they have top environmentalists go
[34:34.140 --> 34:38.100]  yeah we love nuclear reactors they're leaking they're gonna kill the earth we
[34:38.100 --> 34:44.020]  want to kill the earth for the earth and the post-human world is here and all
[34:44.020 --> 34:49.460]  the rest of it because these are desperate people that have sold out to
[34:49.460 --> 34:55.660]  evil and they are trying to get us to go with them because misery loves company
[34:55.660 --> 35:02.660]  we already know the reason for all of this all over the world civilizations
[35:02.660 --> 35:07.180]  are discovered that had plenty of water and plenty of food when they collapsed
[35:07.180 --> 35:12.700]  and there's not even signs of disease but they're all gone and you know what
[35:12.700 --> 35:27.340]  they always find giant masses of skeletons that have been eaten just a
[35:27.340 --> 35:31.740]  few months ago archaeologists in Germany found a town in Germany that's about 8
[35:31.740 --> 35:41.140]  thousand years old and they found tens of thousands of skeletons that have been
[35:41.140 --> 35:46.580]  butchered and eaten and the scientists studied it and found out they were people
[35:46.580 --> 35:54.980]  from all over Europe some of them over 2,000 miles away they'd been taken there
[35:54.980 --> 36:02.620]  to be eat I meant to cover that story on air you can just type it in stone age
[36:02.620 --> 36:08.860]  town found in Germany it was based on cannibalism you're like why would they
[36:08.860 --> 36:17.020]  do that and and and why were people getting hauled there from a thousand
[36:17.020 --> 36:23.780]  miles away or more before recorded history
[36:23.780 --> 36:31.940]  holds as in the days of Noah so shall it be in the days of the antichrist I mean
[36:31.940 --> 36:40.940]  you don't think Robert E. Howard living in Texas just wrote all those Conan books
[36:40.940 --> 36:45.340]  where thulsa dooms riding around kidnapping barbarian kids to take them
[36:45.340 --> 36:54.420]  to faraway kingdom to be gladiators before recorded history and then they
[36:54.420 --> 36:58.940]  actually find villages the exact same thing well he think I was a mason he be
[36:58.940 --> 37:06.140]  that they have the secret knowledge handed down he wasn't just any mason
[37:06.140 --> 37:10.020]  for committed suicide he was basically the heavyweight champion of the world
[37:10.020 --> 37:15.500]  boxer the colonnade the barbarian character was him
[37:22.940 --> 37:28.540]  and then they go find villages basically find the same thing how do you put that
[37:28.540 --> 37:34.660]  in a book how do you know about stuff like that because the establishment knows
[37:34.660 --> 37:39.620]  all of this and knows the real history and we don't
[37:43.220 --> 37:47.060]  and the sooner we start figuring out how things really work and the real
[37:47.060 --> 37:51.220]  history of this planet the sooner we can get about having a future together but
[37:51.220 --> 37:56.100]  if we don't admit who these globalists are and what they're doing and who
[37:56.100 --> 38:01.940]  they're working with it's anti-human we don't have a chance in hell
[38:04.660 --> 38:08.300]  by the way I'm not attacking masons in general George Washington was a mason
[38:08.300 --> 38:12.620]  and he wrote about the Illuminati taking over masonry and the and devil
[38:12.620 --> 38:19.100]  worship taking it over in letters that are in the National Archive you can pull
[38:19.100 --> 38:25.180]  them up and read them sounds like the Alex Jones show when you read them evil
[38:25.180 --> 38:29.540]  secret society organizations trying to take over Christianity trying to take
[38:29.540 --> 38:32.300]  over masonry
[38:35.660 --> 38:40.540]  these groups will take anything over Protestants Catholics Muslims but it's
[38:40.540 --> 38:50.500]  all the same group masonry is just old-fashioned colleges they didn't just
[38:50.500 --> 39:00.420]  teach anybody mathematics or carpentry or astrophysics under other names it was
[39:00.420 --> 39:03.940]  done in secret societies and so you have the mystery cults the mystery
[39:03.940 --> 39:09.620]  schools the mystery religions that's all this is and then there's the lore that
[39:09.620 --> 39:14.580]  goes back into those mystery schools and some of the lore is true some of the
[39:14.580 --> 39:21.540]  lore isn't true but all the books weren't destroyed in Alexandria at the fire at
[39:21.540 --> 39:28.580]  the Great Library they were hauled back to places like Rome you don't just think
[39:28.580 --> 39:33.300]  Christopher Columbus knew about the New World because he just dreamed it up in a
[39:33.300 --> 39:46.620]  crystal ball Sir Francis Bacon all of them knew about it they had a plan they
[39:46.620 --> 39:51.580]  were already sending people to the New World the Mayflower was a mission that
[39:51.580 --> 40:06.780]  came hundreds of years after missions previously and the system all knows that
[40:06.780 --> 40:09.380]  and so there's a decision we all have to make we want a pro-human future or an
[40:09.380 --> 40:15.500]  anti-human future now I'm gonna be a good boy and we come back and I'll hit the
[40:15.500 --> 40:21.940]  news and then dr. Steve Pacinix joining us and then as I said six o'clock
[40:21.940 --> 40:26.060]  tonight I'm gonna do a special report and then air the new film the Clinton
[40:26.060 --> 40:30.940]  body count it's posted info wars.com but with more info very important
[40:30.940 --> 40:38.780]  information and then as I said we'll play it by year it'll probably there be like
[40:38.780 --> 40:41.980]  eight or nine tonight or it'll be tomorrow morning early but we're gonna get
[40:41.980 --> 40:48.380]  out the Epstein New Revelations tonight or tomorrow but I'll be up here late
[40:48.380 --> 40:51.540]  working on that with the Skeleton crew we've got a lot of folks are unwell

[48:44.620 --> 48:49.380]  Tesco said it was absolutely appalled on the reports of Christmas cards we

[48:54.980 --> 48:59.660]  shocked and it goes on my mom and always joke we were in a Chinese restaurant when
[48:59.660 --> 49:02.940]  I was a kid I know where she got it I should ask her but he'd be open to the
[49:02.940 --> 49:07.380]  fortune cookies and she'd say help I'm locked in a Chinese fortune cookie
[49:07.380 --> 49:15.340]  factory he'd ask her where she got that but now it's really happening so art
[49:15.340 --> 49:19.020]  imitates life or life imitates art here's another one this is a Paul Joseph
[49:19.020 --> 49:25.100]  Watson article up on info wars dot com right now in Europe in the UK they make
[49:25.100 --> 49:30.900]  children go to mosque and bow to Allah but not churches but it's a forcing you
[49:30.900 --> 49:35.940]  into it it's in the German after-school programs they tell 14 year old girls to
[49:35.940 --> 49:39.060]  marry a 25 year old Muslim man even though it's illegal I mean this is all
[49:39.060 --> 49:42.980]  goes on they let Muslims rape women and get away with it I've got articles on
[49:42.980 --> 49:48.460]  that today teachers at US school threatened to tell Muslim girls parents
[49:48.460 --> 49:56.060]  after she removes a gym she could have been stoned or killed the teacher was
[49:56.060 --> 49:59.140]  gonna do it but after the principal heard he said no no no as long as it's
[49:59.140 --> 50:05.980]  dress codes being followed that's the left trying to enforce Sharia law which
[50:05.980 --> 50:12.380]  they fetishize because they see it as anti-Christian
[50:14.260 --> 50:20.380]  gotta read the article and get the details now here's an important Michael
[50:20.380 --> 50:26.620]  Schneider article it's upon info wars comm this is America 10 examples that
[50:26.620 --> 50:32.420]  show how dramatically the US has changed as we approach 2020 the change our
[50:32.420 --> 50:40.100]  country needs is not going to happen in Washington I agree with Michael and then
[50:40.100 --> 50:44.900]  he goes over just some of the changes number one the ACLU has started a
[50:44.900 --> 50:50.340]  campaign to make tampons available in all men's restrooms across America now I
[50:50.340 --> 50:55.220]  mean what is that saying it's saying we're gonna impose this ubiquitously and
[50:55.220 --> 51:01.580]  then make you do it and then make any privacy you have null and void as a
[51:01.580 --> 51:04.380]  form of dominance
[51:07.660 --> 51:13.820]  number two senseless violence is all over the country on Sunday we witnessed
[51:13.820 --> 51:17.700]  the worst mass shooting in the city of Chicago but it's black on black so CNN's
[51:17.700 --> 51:21.860]  been ordered to cover it up we're gonna cover that next hour number three it has
[51:21.860 --> 51:27.900]  been another banner year for homicides in Baltimore seven more people shot dead
[51:28.740 --> 51:34.860]  Sunday state legislators in California keep talking about how much they love
[51:34.860 --> 51:38.380]  education but once California has the highest percentage of residents that
[51:38.380 --> 51:47.380]  have never completed the ninth grade it's all by design speaking of California
[51:47.380 --> 51:52.980]  number five mark seagull says the US San Francisco has become the city it's a
[51:52.980 --> 51:57.060]  wash in human waste because of all the drug addicts that are pooping wherever
[51:57.060 --> 52:00.740]  they feel like and the new red diaper doper baby son of the weatherman heads
[52:00.740 --> 52:08.380]  says it's freedom and he backs it number six in our but feels good to do it
[52:08.380 --> 52:11.980]  society of the traditional rules regarding sex marriage and family have
[52:11.980 --> 52:15.540]  been discarded this is paved the way for completely new arrangements that have
[52:15.540 --> 52:19.420]  seemed extremely bizarre past generations of americans for example the
[52:19.420 --> 52:24.500]  polyamorous woman in florida has decided to raise her coming baby with all four
[52:24.500 --> 52:30.580]  of her partners number seven last week the fact that a man was just sentenced
[52:30.580 --> 52:36.460]  to 15 years in prison for burning an lgbtq flag now where's your free speech
[52:36.460 --> 52:41.540]  go there number eight meanwhile legal emirates can commit serious crimes a
[52:41.540 --> 52:45.940]  serious crime in California and just keep getting released including arson
[52:45.940 --> 52:52.100]  rape and arm robbery number nine and a brand new netflix stand-up special
[52:52.100 --> 52:56.380]  michelle wolf told americans to get an abortion made her feel like a god you
[52:56.380 --> 53:01.500]  got to get that baby number 10 30 years ago two-thirds of the population of the
[53:01.500 --> 53:05.780]  country attended church services at least somewhere regularly but today only
[53:05.780 --> 53:14.020]  about one-third do and it goes on from there and with it the prosperity goes
[53:14.020 --> 53:17.980]  away la times california population growth slowest since 1900 his residents
[53:17.980 --> 53:22.060]  leave immigration decelerates because see the land of the free isn't there
[53:22.060 --> 53:27.380]  anymore so it decelerates down as we settle into being third world no more
[53:27.380 --> 53:32.540]  need to flood in because the country's been destroyed
[53:32.540 --> 53:38.180]  meanwhile christianity today editor says his call for impeachment was hyperbole
[53:38.180 --> 53:43.700]  now that it's totally backfired on them dr. Steve pathetic wants to talk about
[53:43.700 --> 53:47.060]  that as well when he joins us bottom of the next hour
[53:47.060 --> 53:56.620]  plenton impeachment judge trump impeachment is phony well of course it's
[53:56.620 --> 54:04.220]  completely and absolutely phony now I want to get into the gun news when we
[54:04.220 --> 54:15.420]  start the next hour there's quite a bit of that how it ties into virginia but
[54:15.420 --> 54:21.340]  something I want to get into right now is some very good news young people in
[54:21.340 --> 54:27.180]  major polls that several articles on it are against abortion of any time and
[54:27.180 --> 54:34.420]  it's accelerating the younger people get into teenage years of over 70% in most
[54:34.420 --> 54:42.860]  polls somewhere in the 60s and it's women girls that are leading the charge in
[54:42.860 --> 54:47.820]  that which shows all their propaganda is backfiring and so the attempt to say oh
[54:47.820 --> 54:51.780]  it's fun to kill babies try it out well that's not going to work either so so
[54:51.780 --> 54:57.580]  there's a real revulsion happening and that's the blind spot these satanist
[54:57.580 --> 55:02.340]  have and there's another big article Bloomberg the year socialism became a
[55:02.340 --> 55:09.180]  dirty word again it was a bad year be any kind of socialist in Europe and then
[55:09.180 --> 55:13.340]  it just goes through how socialism is imploding and people are turning against
[55:13.340 --> 55:21.140]  globalism in general we will get more into that coming up in the next hour
[55:21.140 --> 55:27.780]  please remember that we have put up part one of the Clinton body count a
[55:27.780 --> 55:33.260]  documentary film it's about 30 minutes long it's extremely powerful looks like
[55:33.260 --> 55:36.660]  something you'd see on HBO Gregory's put it together everybody really

[56:15.780 --> 56:19.900]  for it because we're probably won't because it's not Alex Jones in the

[56:29.220 --> 56:32.700]  also the Attorney General was talking about the criminal activity of Soros
[56:32.700 --> 56:39.180]  that is a major sea change we will get into that and the latest on the coup

[59:17.580 --> 59:21.820]  shoulder surgery and a back surgery and that body has made me feel better than

[59:42.220 --> 59:50.580]  sir
[59:50.580 --> 1:00:17.420]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:00:17.420 --> 1:00:25.820]  that admits all about Satanism and death and then they're promoted by the
[1:00:25.820 --> 1:00:34.460]  entire power structure ladies and gentlemen that's what it's all about
[1:00:34.460 --> 1:00:39.340]  shearing our conscience having all the simulated murder on TV and then when
[1:00:39.340 --> 1:00:44.860]  they do it for real we don't care anymore assaulting our psyche John bound
[1:00:44.860 --> 1:00:48.420]  filed a powerful report on this will come back in the latest assault of the
[1:00:48.420 --> 1:00:52.260]  second amendment your son bounds report you're missing something in our life
[1:00:52.260 --> 1:00:55.820]  like we didn't know what and we started kind of exploring and there were people
[1:00:55.820 --> 1:00:59.740]  in our end on my side of the family that were like you need to open your heart
[1:00:59.740 --> 1:01:04.140]  to Christ and that means you know just asking him and not opening your heart
[1:01:04.140 --> 1:01:08.180]  you're not going to get an answer you have to open your heart and open open
[1:01:08.180 --> 1:01:14.780]  your mind to receiving him and when we did that it was like I knew it was true
[1:01:14.780 --> 1:01:18.220]  was going to get a lot better but a lot of the churches are corrupt the devil
[1:01:18.220 --> 1:01:22.220]  senses people in there to do to do to do bad things to you to the turning off the
[1:01:22.220 --> 1:01:25.660]  Christ that's not Christ Christ talked about that extensively Pope Francis is
[1:01:25.660 --> 1:01:29.500]  taking major new steps to open up the Roman Catholic Church's handling of
[1:01:29.500 --> 1:01:34.060]  alleged sexual abuse by priests the Vatican has announced that clergy abuse
[1:01:34.060 --> 1:01:38.660]  cases will no longer be handled as so-called pontifical secrets officials
[1:01:38.660 --> 1:01:43.060]  say that will allow bishops to cooperate more openly with police and alleged
[1:01:43.060 --> 1:01:47.380]  victims just go directly to God and it just gets stronger it just gets better
[1:01:47.380 --> 1:01:52.340]  the church has faced challenges over the centuries and the latest could be one
[1:01:52.340 --> 1:01:58.500]  of its biggest abandonment studies show almost six in ten Millennials raised in
[1:01:58.500 --> 1:02:04.420]  the church have left the background radiation of God's transmission is
[1:02:04.420 --> 1:02:10.300]  strong but it doesn't force its way the enemy forces its way in you argue that
[1:02:10.300 --> 1:02:16.980]  evangelicals like yourself may like the president's platform but you think he's
[1:02:16.980 --> 1:02:21.820]  grossly immoral you described him as a near perfect example of a human being
[1:02:21.820 --> 1:02:27.340]  who is morally lost and confused he's abused his authority for personal gain
[1:02:27.340 --> 1:02:32.460]  betrayed his constitutional oath other members the evangelical the community
[1:02:32.460 --> 1:02:38.140]  community including Billy Graham your founders grandson or done have have
[1:02:38.140 --> 1:02:44.500]  denounced this is the call for president Trump's removal growing I don't know I
[1:02:44.500 --> 1:02:51.060]  mean in one sense my my call for his removal was on the order of hyperbole
[1:02:51.060 --> 1:02:57.180]  in this regard the odds of that happening either by election or a Senate
[1:02:57.180 --> 1:03:02.780]  are actually probably fairly slim at this point what I'm really arguing in
[1:03:02.780 --> 1:03:06.660]  the piece fundamentally is that the president is unfit for office now there
[1:03:06.660 --> 1:03:10.620]  that may be a difference without a distinction without a difference but
[1:03:10.620 --> 1:03:15.780]  once you're aware of that you can then with your will your consciousness that's
[1:03:15.780 --> 1:03:20.060]  free will tune to the channel even if you're in solitary confinement being
[1:03:20.060 --> 1:03:25.100]  tortured you can tune that out and tune right to Christ and that's the secret
[1:03:25.100 --> 1:03:28.100]  they train you to think third-dimensional you've got to go to a
[1:03:28.100 --> 1:03:33.660]  church you've got to go to a leader a priest who then on average is a Satanist
[1:03:33.660 --> 1:03:38.980]  in searing damning language the grand jury report revealed the dark secrets of
[1:03:38.980 --> 1:03:42.900]  the Catholic Church in Pennsylvania priests were raping little boys and
[1:03:42.900 --> 1:03:46.980]  girls and the men of God who were responsible for them did nothing they
[1:03:46.980 --> 1:03:56.140]  hid it all it was child sexual abuse including rape committed by grown men
[1:03:56.140 --> 1:04:02.700]  priests against children the report found over a thousand child victims
[1:04:02.700 --> 1:04:07.340]  identified in the church's own records the alleged crimes often described as
[1:04:07.340 --> 1:04:12.260]  inappropriate contact or boundary issues it names more than 300 predator
[1:04:12.260 --> 1:04:17.100]  priests in six diocese from one end of the state to the other home to more than
[1:04:17.100 --> 1:04:21.740]  1.7 million Catholics and make you think that you found Christ so they can
[1:04:21.740 --> 1:04:25.260]  mislead you so you turn against Christ and don't believe in Christ that's the
[1:04:25.260 --> 1:04:29.700]  devil's biggest trick and I would say 80% of the churches in the world now in
[1:04:29.700 --> 1:04:32.940]  big industrialized areas are globalists run World Council of Churches run by
[1:04:32.940 --> 1:04:37.220]  the Rockefellers and they're either worldly or their secret atheists are
[1:04:37.220 --> 1:04:40.260]  leftists who went to the seminary that's all been admitted but then the
[1:04:40.260 --> 1:04:43.260]  higher-up ones are Satanists people like the Pope and his deputy Pope they're
[1:04:43.260 --> 1:04:47.460]  not Catholics are not Christians and that's their plan that's how they
[1:04:47.460 --> 1:04:51.340]  mislead you and Christ spent most his time looking at the Pharisees and saying
[1:04:51.340 --> 1:04:55.140]  they're the ones misleading you they're not the real leaders they are the
[1:04:55.140 --> 1:05:02.660]  synagogue of Satan we're closing out the year 2019 I don't have to tell you
[1:05:02.660 --> 1:05:06.420]  that 2020 is gonna be maker to break it not just for him for war it's not just
[1:05:06.420 --> 1:05:10.420]  for America but the whole world we are in a battle between the forces of
[1:05:10.420 --> 1:05:13.700]  globalism that want to post human world and those that want a pro-human world
[1:05:13.700 --> 1:05:17.900]  we're in a fight between Satan and Christ and it's being played out amongst
[1:05:17.900 --> 1:05:22.940]  us mortals but it's being directed from on high and I'm just telling the
[1:05:22.940 --> 1:05:28.780]  listeners this broadcast without you we're gonna lose this fight I need all
[1:05:28.780 --> 1:05:32.180]  of you to realize how important you are and how important info wars is and what
[1:05:32.180 --> 1:05:36.660]  we've done together and it just takes stock and take measure at the end of the
[1:05:36.660 --> 1:05:40.740]  year and think about what you're gonna do whether supporting info wars buying
[1:05:40.740 --> 1:05:44.820]  products from us or starting your own show just whatever you do take action
[1:05:44.820 --> 1:05:49.940]  now history is happening please do your Christmas shopping please do your new
[1:05:49.940 --> 1:05:53.540]  year shopping and in forward store.com we've got the best products you're only
[1:05:53.540 --> 1:06:21.100]  helping the globalists if you don't do it thank you.
[1:06:53.860 --> 1:07:07.660]  The clock is ticking. The globalists are scientifically moving against us. Now I've
[1:07:07.660 --> 1:07:13.940]  probably told this story a hundred times it's definitely approaching that and
[1:07:13.940 --> 1:07:18.900]  I'm gonna tell it again not because I have lack of news because if you
[1:07:18.900 --> 1:07:22.980]  understand this you understand the globalist mindset and how they're
[1:07:22.980 --> 1:07:29.220]  targeting everyone. Thank you for joining us again we're into the second hour of
[1:07:29.220 --> 1:07:37.180]  the Alex Jones show a program that is dreaded that is hated that is reviled
[1:07:37.180 --> 1:07:43.300]  that is lied about that is demonized by the establishment by the corrupt
[1:07:43.300 --> 1:07:51.580]  powers and control this planet by the countless twisted minions who serve the
[1:07:51.580 --> 1:08:00.460]  fraud and why is that because I'm authentic my crew is authentic we're
[1:08:00.460 --> 1:08:05.420]  genuine we're real it's not a game it's not a joke we're not putting on airs
[1:08:05.420 --> 1:08:09.340]  we're just real people know what we're talking about and that work hard in
[1:08:09.340 --> 1:08:13.220]  defense of liberty who are committed and it's the journey of fighting
[1:08:13.220 --> 1:08:19.100]  corruption that has been so empowering but the corrupt think cheating and
[1:08:19.100 --> 1:08:23.900]  stealing and lying is gonna get them ahead now many years ago I was on an
[1:08:23.900 --> 1:08:31.100]  airplane flying to New York City beyond the view they invited me back but I
[1:08:31.100 --> 1:08:38.980]  didn't go beer on those hard pieces of joke and I was sitting next in the first
[1:08:38.980 --> 1:08:45.180]  class to this individual I said I've seen you before and he goes yeah I'm the
[1:08:45.180 --> 1:08:51.020]  head of this big bank and he knew who I was even visiting his dad who's a former
[1:08:51.020 --> 1:08:59.980]  army general in nursing home in San Antonio and we talked off and on for
[1:08:59.980 --> 1:09:07.300]  the three-hour flight we thought more intensely the last hour and towards the
[1:09:07.300 --> 1:09:18.540]  end he said listen people adapt to being slaves and he says this off record
[1:09:18.540 --> 1:09:21.620]  so I'm gonna tell you this with enough record I mean obviously you can say what
[1:09:21.620 --> 1:09:25.140]  I tell you it's not gonna matter but just don't say who I am and I'll tell you
[1:09:25.140 --> 1:09:30.380]  this and he was very arrogant about it and very you know trying to size me up
[1:09:30.380 --> 1:09:40.060]  like project that he was powerful and dominant in the boss and he said you
[1:09:40.060 --> 1:09:46.900]  don't get it you think they adapt and overcome like the Marines no no people
[1:09:46.900 --> 1:09:57.260]  adapt to being slaves and we're in full control and technocrats are gonna take
[1:09:57.260 --> 1:10:02.780]  over all the governments well that was about ten years before at Deimos they
[1:10:02.780 --> 1:10:08.540]  actually said with Zuckerberg and Bloomberg and Xi Jinping and Juncker
[1:10:08.540 --> 1:10:15.860]  and all of them and Gordon Brown that we're gonna get rid of governments
[1:10:15.860 --> 1:10:19.940]  entirely and have the EU appoint leaders of governments and that we are
[1:10:19.940 --> 1:10:24.460]  technocrats and when a global technocracy what an incredible statement
[1:10:24.460 --> 1:10:36.020]  of planetary world government but it's true that if we submit to them and if
[1:10:36.020 --> 1:10:40.260]  we don't fight back and we just give in to the poison and just accept that we're
[1:10:40.260 --> 1:10:43.380]  all gonna die early a cancer and all gonna have neurological disorders then
[1:10:43.380 --> 1:10:47.940]  our IQ is gonna go straight down and that the humans are obsolete then if we
[1:10:47.940 --> 1:10:56.220]  just give into it and just accept it then we are evolving devolving adapting
[1:10:56.220 --> 1:11:05.540]  to our own destruction that's not improvising that's not overcoming but
[1:11:05.540 --> 1:11:08.980]  if you now look all these years later they didn't believe that humanity could
[1:11:08.980 --> 1:11:12.660]  rally they didn't believe in human empowerment but we only need a few
[1:11:12.660 --> 1:11:15.620]  percentage points to understand what's happening to defeat them and we've got
[1:11:15.620 --> 1:11:20.180]  way more than that and so now they could never see Hillary being defeated they
[1:11:20.180 --> 1:11:24.660]  could never see all over the world populist winning election after election
[1:11:24.660 --> 1:11:28.820]  and as they take away those elections people demand even more destruction of
[1:11:28.820 --> 1:11:37.860]  the globalist system and here's this big long Bloomberg report from yesterday
[1:11:37.860 --> 1:11:46.580]  the year socialism became a dirty word again it's an eight-page article and it
[1:11:46.580 --> 1:11:52.300]  says the technocrats of Europe who were so cool just a few years ago are now
[1:11:52.300 --> 1:11:56.180]  hated and no matter where they are they're being thrown out and people that
[1:11:56.180 --> 1:12:05.140]  had accepted socialism as the future now are rejecting it everywhere they're
[1:12:05.140 --> 1:12:10.780]  losing everywhere where there's a real election and the people now you know I
[1:12:10.780 --> 1:12:18.740]  told this story a couple years ago my parents were in England and multiple
[1:12:18.740 --> 1:12:23.140]  times when they heard they were from Texas the taxi drivers said oh Alex Jones
[1:12:23.140 --> 1:12:26.860]  we love him you know him and when they'd say well that's our son well then
[1:12:26.860 --> 1:12:32.540]  everything was free it happened in France now that's not me here going oh
[1:12:32.540 --> 1:12:40.020]  look I'm so cool I'm saying that's a gauge and I know a lot of people that live
[1:12:40.020 --> 1:12:43.740]  over the UK when they tried to stop rings at the last four years it only
[1:12:43.740 --> 1:12:49.140]  pissed people off more and I predicted all of that that oh they're gonna hold it
[1:12:49.140 --> 1:12:52.660]  back and not give it to them just like they never voted to enter the EU so the
[1:12:52.660 --> 1:12:57.780]  same tyrants are gonna try to block all of that and that's just gonna enrage
[1:12:57.780 --> 1:13:03.900]  people more because this is a long-term fight and once people get into fighting
[1:13:03.900 --> 1:13:07.500]  it's kind of like hiking the first few times you do it get sore pretty soon you
[1:13:07.500 --> 1:13:10.860]  catch yourself hiking 10 miles 15 miles loving it you're not you're addicted to
[1:13:10.860 --> 1:13:16.740]  it it's like fighting you get addicted to that once you get into overcoming them
[1:13:16.740 --> 1:13:22.140]  and you adapt to winning instead of adapting to be a loser it's incredible so
[1:13:22.140 --> 1:13:26.620]  see the world is telling you to adapt to being a loser that's how you get padded
[1:13:26.620 --> 1:13:29.900]  on the head but that's a false currency you don't go anywhere with that except
[1:13:29.900 --> 1:13:35.180]  more slavery you need to adapt to being a winner and that starts with not
[1:13:35.180 --> 1:13:38.780]  letting them grind you down and not submitting to them and in little ways
[1:13:38.780 --> 1:13:43.540]  sabotaging them whether it's sticking an info or sticker in a bathroom stall or
[1:13:43.540 --> 1:13:50.380]  calling into a talk show or speaking out at your church or buying a product at
[1:13:50.380 --> 1:13:55.260]  infoorstore.com or praying to God at night or running for political office or
[1:13:55.260 --> 1:13:58.500]  just being a good dad or mom
[1:13:59.820 --> 1:14:04.580]  not buying from the globalist corporations that's how you change the
[1:14:04.580 --> 1:14:07.140]  world and you read this big long article I could do the whole show just on
[1:14:07.140 --> 1:14:13.260]  this and they admit they're being rounded
[1:14:18.460 --> 1:14:24.340]  because you see the world was asleep and so that banker could make fun of
[1:14:24.340 --> 1:14:28.580]  everybody when they were asleep but see they're not asleep now you may have
[1:14:28.580 --> 1:14:34.060]  masses of people that are basically gone we're very sad for them we're gonna
[1:14:34.060 --> 1:14:40.180]  triage them but we're moving forward the whole article goes through it it was a
[1:14:40.180 --> 1:14:44.820]  bad year to be any kind of socialist in Europe the Klein has been long and
[1:14:44.820 --> 1:14:50.140]  agonizing for the once dominant force but in 2019 falling popularity reached
[1:14:50.140 --> 1:14:55.380]  new depths and raised questions over whether reinvention could lead to
[1:14:55.380 --> 1:15:01.780]  revival its globalism its establishment ism everybody's done with it a decade
[1:15:01.780 --> 1:15:05.620]  ago the Prime Minister's of Britain Spain Greece and even Hungary were from
[1:15:05.620 --> 1:15:09.980]  the center left many went on to swiftly lose power but then socialist
[1:15:09.980 --> 1:15:14.340]  governments emerged in france and Italy now the political brand looks like on an
[1:15:14.340 --> 1:15:18.980] achronism but really it's open borders Soros globalism and then it goes
[1:15:18.980 --> 1:15:23.180]  through how they're losing on every front we'll talk more about this with
[1:15:23.180 --> 1:15:29.180]  Dr. Steve Pachennick coming up I want to hit the gun control too and the fake
[1:15:29.180 --> 1:15:33.340]  numbers they're putting out there and more and also want to give you a little

[1:15:39.340 --> 1:15:43.260]  revelations really a big deal and that's either gonna be tonight it'll be
[1:15:43.260 --> 1:15:47.660]  released or it'll be tomorrow morning at info wars.com for a show and of course

[1:20:28.300 --> 1:20:42.860]  We are back live broadcasting worldwide on this Monday December 23rd 2019
[1:20:42.860 --> 1:20:50.860]  transmission now I wanted to get to a few of these stories here and tied into
[1:20:50.860 --> 1:20:57.940]  what's really really happening remember the project Veritas CNN club we're gonna
[1:20:57.940 --> 1:21:04.620]  play that here for you in just a second project Veritas where they're talking to
[1:21:04.620 --> 1:21:07.820]  one of the producers and they say oh well when there's a shooting in Chicago
[1:21:07.820 --> 1:21:15.460]  and it's black on black we don't cover it because white people don't care well
[1:21:15.460 --> 1:21:23.180]  no that's not really true that's you saying that that's the chicken or the
[1:21:23.180 --> 1:21:28.740]  egg mass shooting in Chicago house party leaves 13 wounded where is the
[1:21:28.740 --> 1:21:34.260]  outrage completely unacceptable Baltimore violent weekend includes mass
[1:21:34.260 --> 1:21:41.660]  shooting of seven downtown three homicides Baltimore Sun meanwhile Michael
[1:21:41.660 --> 1:21:46.900]  Bloomberg claims 21 students are shot every day anyone 18 or younger he calls
[1:21:46.900 --> 1:21:53.260]  a student it's not true to totally fake number and even the Washington Post and
[1:21:53.260 --> 1:21:58.260]  others admitted that Pelosi and he and others are putting out this info giving
[1:21:58.260 --> 1:22:08.980]  her for Pinocchios so that's what they're doing is they're lying about all
[1:22:08.980 --> 1:22:14.220]  this they're about 23,000 deaths a year from guns more than half of those are
[1:22:14.220 --> 1:22:19.900]  people committing suicide and then you still got more than 10,000 people being
[1:22:19.900 --> 1:22:24.660]  killed by guns and most of those then are police and citizens killing criminals
[1:22:24.660 --> 1:22:28.940]  but you end up with about 3,000 people or so that are usually in a city look at
[1:22:28.940 --> 1:22:34.140]  the numbers we've had professor lot on the top statisticians the world and so
[1:22:34.140 --> 1:22:37.460]  it's very rare for an innocent person compared to other deaths to be killed by
[1:22:37.460 --> 1:22:41.460]  a gun it still happens and when it happens the media plays it up like it's
[1:22:41.460 --> 1:22:45.580]  the end of the world it's like shark attacks are pretty rare but you hear
[1:22:45.580 --> 1:22:51.660]  about them all the time because they hype them up but it's way down the list of
[1:22:51.660 --> 1:22:54.500]  ways you're gonna die
[1:22:55.020 --> 1:22:58.860]  you people blame baseball bats or hammers and people use them in murders no
[1:22:58.860 --> 1:23:06.260]  or knives no well in England they are trying to do that so here's from the
[1:23:06.260 --> 1:23:14.700]  vault back when a project veritas caught this on tape I think that shootings
[1:23:14.700 --> 1:23:21.580]  in poor areas or minority communities don't get as much coverage as if they
[1:23:21.580 --> 1:23:24.980]  were to happen in a white area so CNN doesn't cover a shooting that happened
[1:23:24.980 --> 1:23:27.340]  in a black neighborhood the same that they were covered shooting in a white
[1:23:27.340 --> 1:23:31.060]  neighborhood I think unless if we're like a mash if we're mass shooting like
[1:23:31.060 --> 1:23:34.820]  if it were like 20 people killed they would cover it if there were like two
[1:23:34.820 --> 1:23:43.220]  people killing in a game related violence and so that's why they play down
[1:23:43.220 --> 1:23:47.140]  the Democrat-controlled cities that literally have almost all the crime in
[1:23:47.140 --> 1:23:50.460]  the United States taking place in them almost all the violent crime because
[1:23:50.460 --> 1:23:57.380]  they've always been set up for that the Democrats aren't organized crime group
[1:23:57.660 --> 1:24:03.380]  the movie the gangs of New York's based on a composite of true stories it's
[1:24:03.380 --> 1:24:12.260]  historical fiction that's Democrats in the movie using crime to control the
[1:24:12.260 --> 1:24:20.500]  city and racial division read the WikiLeaks its reality now Howard Stern
[1:24:20.500 --> 1:24:26.700]  has had Jimmy Camelon and done big pieces attacking me and he reportedly is
[1:24:26.700 --> 1:24:30.620]  doing pieces every week and some of these are really funny and I think the
[1:24:30.620 --> 1:24:34.620]  stuff you see on Stern's show is some pretty good comedy I don't agree with
[1:24:34.620 --> 1:24:39.980]  the really vulgar stuff but he's obviously a funny guy and this latest
[1:24:39.980 --> 1:24:45.620]  piece overall I think helps get the word out about Epstein even though it makes a
[1:24:45.620 --> 1:24:49.420]  joke out of it except at the end when I talk about oh they want to kill white
[1:24:49.420 --> 1:24:52.580]  Christians well the left does say white people are bad and the Christians are
[1:24:52.580 --> 1:24:55.780]  bad I mean that that's a fact and that's a problem of the left doing that it's
[1:24:55.780 --> 1:25:00.860]  like Sasha Bear Cohen saying that replacement migration doesn't exist when
[1:25:00.860 --> 1:25:07.100]  it's official but here's what Stern's been up to oh Alex Jones wants to talk
[1:25:07.100 --> 1:25:12.180]  to us he's upset that he is not going to be on Holly weird squares tomorrow you

[1:32:31.980 --> 1:32:35.980]  I'm going to make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend. I don't think that happens very often. It's never happened to me.
[1:32:35.980 --> 1:32:40.980]  I've never had anyone knock on my door and said, Tate, you're such a good guy. How can I improve your life in every single way?
[1:32:40.980 --> 1:32:44.980]  There's only one person who woke up and thought that, and that was me. I woke up and thought, you know what?

[1:33:46.980 --> 1:33:54.980]  But you are the wind in the sails, viewers and listeners, the men and women in the arena, to your word of mouth,
[1:33:54.980 --> 1:33:58.980]  that he is the only currency of the realm.
[1:33:58.980 --> 1:34:06.980]  Well, Dr. Steve Pachennick's become on the show 18 years. He's got a new, very censored book, and I've been interviewing him 18 years,
[1:34:06.980 --> 1:34:09.980]  and he never wants to come on about one of his books.
[1:34:09.980 --> 1:34:13.980]  I try to bring his books up, and he just, no, I'm not going to get into that. I got other stuff to do.
[1:34:13.980 --> 1:34:17.980]  He, of course, has written dozens of bestsellers. He was the main source for Tom Clancy,
[1:34:17.980 --> 1:34:23.980]  wrote a bunch of big books with him, was the Jack Ryan source in the book.
[1:34:23.980 --> 1:34:28.980]  Clancy openly talked about that, and now he does want to talk about this book.
[1:34:28.980 --> 1:34:30.980]  We're going to do it extensively in the next hour.
[1:34:30.980 --> 1:34:36.980]  American Warrior in Crisis, Tales of a Political Psychiatrist.
[1:34:36.980 --> 1:34:39.980]  He is a psychiatrist and a lot of other things.
[1:34:39.980 --> 1:34:46.980]  And he's gotten his other books made into big films, but boy, Hollywood will not touch this.
[1:34:46.980 --> 1:34:49.980]  So we're going to get to the book because it ties into all of this,
[1:34:49.980 --> 1:34:53.980]  but didn't need to talk to Dr. Pachennick before we got him on because he's a smart guy.
[1:34:53.980 --> 1:34:56.980]  He wants to get into exactly what I wanted to get into.
[1:34:56.980 --> 1:35:00.980]  Didn't even tell him this. The impeachment coup, what's behind that, where we're going,
[1:35:00.980 --> 1:35:08.980]  and how to counter this corrupt, damaged, deep state that is losing power,
[1:35:08.980 --> 1:35:13.980]  and what is emerging out of that, the big conflict with China,
[1:35:13.980 --> 1:35:20.980]  and of course, Jeffrey Epstein, and really what Epstein was doing and really what he was up to.
[1:35:20.980 --> 1:35:25.980]  And I'm going to shoot a special report this evening that we're going to put up in the morning.
[1:35:25.980 --> 1:35:32.980]  I may put it up tonight with an individual who wants to go on air and say who they are,
[1:35:32.980 --> 1:35:37.980]  but I'm going to tell them when they get here this afternoon that I really think that they might want to literally
[1:35:37.980 --> 1:35:41.980]  stay in the shadows just because they're still investigating and they've gotten a lot of stuff.
[1:35:41.980 --> 1:35:47.980]  I mean, you wouldn't believe what they've got.
[1:35:47.980 --> 1:35:51.980]  It'll make you lose sleep, but very dangerous stuff.
[1:35:51.980 --> 1:35:54.980]  I don't say that that cool. I mean, this is really dangerous stuff.
[1:35:54.980 --> 1:36:01.980]  It's why I want to just get this out as soon as possible because the danger is holding on to it.
[1:36:01.980 --> 1:36:03.980]  But everybody else is scared.
[1:36:03.980 --> 1:36:07.980]  So it's our job to do this. I've committed to do this.
[1:36:07.980 --> 1:36:17.980]  And so we're going to release this, the big stuff tonight or tomorrow, and then more is coming.
[1:36:17.980 --> 1:36:21.980]  And by the way, this is all known. We won't get any attention for it.
[1:36:21.980 --> 1:36:24.980]  That's fine. We'll probably get death-threaded soon some more.
[1:36:24.980 --> 1:36:28.980]  But you'll see all this then on the national news in about a month is how it works.
[1:36:28.980 --> 1:36:31.980]  So it's our job to put it out to then force them to cover it.
[1:36:31.980 --> 1:36:37.980]  And it gets into the whole project veritas type stuff where the media knows and there's recordings of that and screenshots and all of it.
[1:36:37.980 --> 1:36:40.980]  And let's just say the Epstein stuff is still ongoing.
[1:36:40.980 --> 1:36:42.980]  He was only one guy and basically the fall guy.
[1:36:42.980 --> 1:36:51.980]  So Dr. Steve Pacinic has the floor for the rest of the hour and 20-something minutes until Joe Salente takes over.
[1:36:51.980 --> 1:36:55.980]  And I want to say Merry Christmas to all of our audience and to Dr. Steve Pacinic.
[1:36:55.980 --> 1:36:58.980]  I'm not going to get into this whole bio, but he helped run the Camp David Accords.
[1:36:58.980 --> 1:37:02.980]  That's how long he's been around, helped found Delta Force, done a whole bunch of stuff since then.
[1:37:02.980 --> 1:37:05.980]  He's on record, you know, overthrowing governments.
[1:37:05.980 --> 1:37:08.980]  He's talked about it on air before and gotten called into federal court over it.
[1:37:08.980 --> 1:37:11.980]  I mean, so he's got to be careful about how to get to here on air.
[1:37:11.980 --> 1:37:14.980]  But you talk about a source, there's all these cue fantasies and stuff.
[1:37:14.980 --> 1:37:17.980]  I mean, this is a real guy that's been around a long time and knows a lot of stuff.
[1:37:17.980 --> 1:37:20.980]  This is a real deal here. This is, and then that's why he's showing his face.
[1:37:20.980 --> 1:37:22.980]  Didn't do that, you know, until the last few years.
[1:37:22.980 --> 1:37:24.980]  That's how serious the time is.
[1:37:24.980 --> 1:37:28.980]  Mark, tell us where we are right now from your perspective.
[1:37:28.980 --> 1:37:31.980]  How the coup against Trump's going, curb balls we should expect.
[1:37:31.980 --> 1:37:34.980]  And then what Epstein really is.
[1:37:34.980 --> 1:37:39.980]  Oh, this is great. Thank you for coming on and Merry Christmas to everybody and happy Hanukkah.
[1:37:39.980 --> 1:37:48.980]  The reality of the coup is that when it fails, it fails quite prominently.
[1:37:48.980 --> 1:37:52.980]  And what is the coup? Let me explain to the audience several coups.
[1:37:52.980 --> 1:37:56.980]  I was involved in what you call a soft food. That means we don't use military.
[1:37:56.980 --> 1:37:58.980]  We basically transfer power very quickly.
[1:37:58.980 --> 1:38:05.980]  It occurred during the Nixon administration where Nixon gave the rights over to Ford.
[1:38:05.980 --> 1:38:11.980]  And in fact, the man who was important in that was Kissinger because he maintained the stability of the country.
[1:38:11.980 --> 1:38:16.980]  I was involved in other coups that were hard coups, which was in Italy,
[1:38:16.980 --> 1:38:23.980]  which means we use force or force had been used or in Cambodia where I had to disarm the Khmer Rouge.
[1:38:23.980 --> 1:38:28.980]  And ironically, now I can say because in Israeli operative died, I was involved in the coup,
[1:38:28.980 --> 1:38:33.980]  which Israelis did not know the assassination of Rabin.
[1:38:33.980 --> 1:38:40.980]  This is the first ever heard of because I had interviewed Rabin and I found him to be exceedingly depressed.
[1:38:40.980 --> 1:38:46.980]  He made it to one of the right-hand man and in turn, Rabin was assassinated,
[1:38:46.980 --> 1:38:51.980]  not for the Oslo agreement, but because he was so depressed he could not function.
[1:38:51.980 --> 1:38:54.980]  Israel be stunned on that statement.
[1:38:54.980 --> 1:39:00.980]  The other coups have to do with the Bush senior administration and the Bush junior administration,
[1:39:00.980 --> 1:39:02.980]  where we transferred power.
[1:39:02.980 --> 1:39:04.980]  So what happens in a coup?
[1:39:04.980 --> 1:39:09.980]  In a coup, what happens, power is transferred very quickly and it's done quietly.
[1:39:09.980 --> 1:39:17.980]  What happened in this case was that Brennan and Clapper and Comey, that was the CIA and the FBI,
[1:39:17.980 --> 1:39:23.980]  got together from the very beginning under the auspices of Obama and Hillary Clinton and the Clinton administration
[1:39:23.980 --> 1:39:25.980]  and say, we don't want Trump.
[1:39:25.980 --> 1:39:27.980]  It was as simple as that.
[1:39:27.980 --> 1:39:34.980]  They then instituted what they called a hard and soft coup because they literally wanted to get rid of him.
[1:39:34.980 --> 1:39:41.980]  In turn, the FBI, which is a highly compromised institution, I mean, highly, from the very beginning
[1:39:41.980 --> 1:39:48.980]  when it was created by a homosexual who, you know, J. Edgar Hoover, they love to talk about him,
[1:39:48.980 --> 1:39:50.980]  but he was a cross-dresser.
[1:39:50.980 --> 1:39:52.980]  He was a nasty man.
[1:39:52.980 --> 1:39:54.980]  It wasn't the issue of cross-dressing.
[1:39:54.980 --> 1:39:59.980]  It was the issue that he had information on every one of our presidents and basically used it.
[1:39:59.980 --> 1:40:01.980]  That's when Nixon got rid of him.
[1:40:01.980 --> 1:40:04.980]  And from that point on, I was not a fan of the FBI.
[1:40:04.980 --> 1:40:10.980]  It wasn't only a factor that they were deprecated in terms of their importance,
[1:40:10.980 --> 1:40:18.980]  but they were ineffective when I had to do the Hanafi Muslim, when I had to do other coups or other hostages.
[1:40:18.980 --> 1:40:20.980]  The FBI was just useless.
[1:40:20.980 --> 1:40:25.980]  And it's an organization which has to be stripped down or literally taken apart.
[1:40:25.980 --> 1:40:27.980]  Comey is a disaster.
[1:40:27.980 --> 1:40:33.980]  He was a failed individual, as was Brennan, who was a CIA and director of the CIA.
[1:40:33.980 --> 1:40:36.980]  But he came out of what we call the analyst group, not the DDO.
[1:40:36.980 --> 1:40:38.980]  He created a company.
[1:40:38.980 --> 1:40:39.980]  He failed at that.
[1:40:39.980 --> 1:40:48.980]  And he kind of, what I would say, worked his way up the CIA hierarchy where he took care of a young African-American
[1:40:48.980 --> 1:40:54.980]  by the name of Obama, who was really a CIA operative, and his mother, Ann Dunham.
[1:40:54.980 --> 1:41:01.980]  So we're permeated with CIA, and it's not a conspiracy issue as much as it is.
[1:41:01.980 --> 1:41:03.980]  There are real problems.
[1:41:03.980 --> 1:41:10.980]  When you have somebody who comes totally out of the paradigm of the CIA or the intelligence network
[1:41:10.980 --> 1:41:15.980]  and out of the paradigm of a politician like Trump, forget what Trump accomplished.
[1:41:15.980 --> 1:41:21.980]  The point is, a man like Trump, who is a businessman, who doesn't really care about politics,
[1:41:21.980 --> 1:41:25.980]  who really cares about implementing outcomes.
[1:41:25.980 --> 1:41:28.980]  He cares about building an ice skating rink.
[1:41:28.980 --> 1:41:31.980]  Walt in the memorial, as he did for my kids.
[1:41:31.980 --> 1:41:36.980]  He built a 42nd Street, Fifth Avenue, Chum Towers, then the Casino.
[1:41:36.980 --> 1:41:39.980]  He likes to execute tangible things.
[1:41:39.980 --> 1:41:40.980]  Exactly.
[1:41:40.980 --> 1:41:43.980]  What he says in between is not as relevant as the end product.
[1:41:43.980 --> 1:41:50.980]  But we have never, never had a president of the United States who was that efficient and that much of a businessman.
[1:41:50.980 --> 1:41:52.980]  They like to say they were businessmen.
[1:41:52.980 --> 1:41:56.980]  The Bush seniors like to say they were in Zapata oil, but they weren't.
[1:41:56.980 --> 1:42:05.980]  They went down all the way from the Wasp, Anglo-Saxons, northeast, and went down to Texas to make believe they were oil diggers.
[1:42:05.980 --> 1:42:07.980]  And that's where Bush Jr. came out.
[1:42:07.980 --> 1:42:08.980]  He was an artifact.
[1:42:08.980 --> 1:42:14.980]  Sure, they were creating a Texas legend because nobody trusted the guys from Kenny Bugport, Maine.
[1:42:14.980 --> 1:42:15.980]  Now you got it.
[1:42:15.980 --> 1:42:22.980]  They had that type of individual created by the agency, a product of the agency, and came out of the Northeast.
[1:42:22.980 --> 1:42:25.980]  Then we started having a power shift down to the South.
[1:42:25.980 --> 1:42:32.980]  As I told you, to Texas, down to North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, New York was losing power.
[1:42:32.980 --> 1:42:33.980]  Illinois.
[1:42:33.980 --> 1:42:34.980]  I want to keep you there.
[1:42:34.980 --> 1:42:35.980]  We got to go to Brighton.
[1:42:35.980 --> 1:42:39.980]  You're giving a big picture and we'll get into Epstein because you were, you would come on the show like 15 years ago and say,
[1:42:39.980 --> 1:42:45.980]  oh, this was going to happen, the EU is going to fall apart, and they're all going to fail and be like, oh, that guys, I even thought you were being too optimistic,
[1:42:45.980 --> 1:42:47.980]  but it's all happening now.
[1:42:47.980 --> 1:42:50.980]  So I want to get into what's coming next as well.
[1:42:50.980 --> 1:42:51.980]  But first hit Epstein.
[1:42:51.980 --> 1:42:52.980]  We'll be right back.
[1:42:54.980 --> 1:42:57.980]  It's time to take yourself to the next level.
[1:42:57.980 --> 1:42:58.980]  It doesn't matter if you're a man.
[1:42:58.980 --> 1:42:59.980]  It doesn't matter if you're a woman.
[1:42:59.980 --> 1:43:01.980]  It doesn't matter if you're old or young.
[1:43:01.980 --> 1:43:06.980]  As you age, preglonone levels in the body go down.
[1:43:06.980 --> 1:43:17.980]  Now, in 60 seconds, I don't have time to tell you what preglonone does, but look into the fact that they've been prescribing it since the 1920s for people that have arthritis.
[1:43:17.980 --> 1:43:19.980]  And then it just gets wilder from there.
[1:43:19.980 --> 1:43:25.980]  Medical science knows all about this, but they suppress information about preglonone.
[1:43:25.980 --> 1:43:32.980]  We've got the best form of preglonone with a bunch of high quality vitamins and minerals in real red pill.
[1:43:32.980 --> 1:43:35.980]  Real red pill plus has some added energy as well.
[1:43:35.980 --> 1:43:41.980]  Now you can get it for 65% off with a free bottle of Biotrus selenium that's from the mustard seed.
[1:43:41.980 --> 1:43:43.980]  The two go together in an incredible way.
[1:43:43.980 --> 1:43:52.980]  The real red pill and real red pill plus 65% off with a free bottle of Biotrus selenium at infowarstore.com through the new year.
[1:43:52.980 --> 1:43:53.980]  Change your life.
[1:43:53.980 --> 1:43:55.980]  Take yourself to the next level.
[1:43:58.980 --> 1:44:00.980]  Owl killer in New Jersey.
[1:44:00.980 --> 1:44:01.980]  You're on the air. Go ahead.
[1:44:01.980 --> 1:44:04.980]  Alex, hey, I just want to say it's great to be back once again.
[1:44:04.980 --> 1:44:07.980]  I've never gotten to do this, but I'm going to give you a shout out for your product.
[1:44:07.980 --> 1:44:12.980]  So that's super blue fluoride free toothpaste and that super blue whitening toothpaste is on another level.
[1:44:12.980 --> 1:44:17.980]  I use the one I use the super blue in the morning and then the whitening at night and it absorbs into your gum.
[1:44:17.980 --> 1:44:20.980]  It is by far the best product I've ever used in my life.
[1:44:20.980 --> 1:44:23.980]  I literally just took a turbo course on my way to the gym right now.
[1:44:23.980 --> 1:44:31.980]  I've had four shoulder surgeries and the back surgery and that body has made me feel better than any type of physical therapy or anything that I've ever done in my life.
[1:44:31.980 --> 1:44:35.980]  So I just want to get that out of the way. Support this man. Everything that he exposed.
[1:44:35.980 --> 1:44:39.980]  Nobody knew about Bohemian Grove. Nobody knew about Epstein. Nobody knew about Bilderberg.
[1:44:39.980 --> 1:44:43.980]  Nobody called 9-11 before it happened in July 2001. Go look it up yourself.
[1:44:43.980 --> 1:44:46.980]  Well, we try our best, sir. They definitely want us off the air without you or not here.
[1:44:46.980 --> 1:44:49.980]  But yeah, these are all great products. So thank you, sir.
[1:44:49.980 --> 1:45:02.980]  The Globalists think America is done. The Globalists think that the West is done.
[1:45:02.980 --> 1:45:07.980]  They think that Christians are done and finished. They believe they've broken our backs.
[1:45:07.980 --> 1:45:12.980]  They believe that with big tech censorship we'll just crawl into ditches and submit to them.
[1:45:12.980 --> 1:45:20.980]  And they believe that if they can demonize and shut down info wars that they rightfully see as a symbol, a beacon of populism and freedom,
[1:45:20.980 --> 1:45:24.980]  not just to America but to the whole world, that they can demoralize everybody else and win.
[1:45:24.980 --> 1:45:27.980]  While they can shut info wars down, they can intimidate everybody else.
[1:45:27.980 --> 1:45:31.980]  That's why it's beyond critical that you keep info wars on the air.
[1:45:31.980 --> 1:45:35.980]  It's only by your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support that we're on air.
[1:45:35.980 --> 1:45:38.980]  And I want to thank you all this Christmas for your past support.
[1:45:38.980 --> 1:45:42.980]  But I want to encourage you now to redouble your efforts and financially support us
[1:45:42.980 --> 1:45:46.980]  by getting great products you need during the 12 days of Christmas and infowarstore.com.

[1:46:30.980 --> 1:46:34.980]  So again, it says Christmas lights are a lot like Epstein,
[1:46:34.980 --> 1:46:41.980]  these things don't hang themselves on the front, on the back, it's got infowars.com and shows the O in info wars as a wreath.
[1:46:41.980 --> 1:46:46.980]  It's also a noose. The system can't stand it when you promote things to the grassroots level.
[1:46:46.980 --> 1:46:50.980]  They can't stand it when you fund independent pro-America, pro-human media.
[1:46:50.980 --> 1:46:56.980]  That's why you've got to take advantage of this shirt and get it today at infowarstore.com.
[1:47:21.980 --> 1:47:23.980]  No borders, no walls, no USA at all.
[1:47:23.980 --> 1:47:28.980]  Well then, what will we be? What is our culture? Hollywood? The Communist Chinese?
[1:47:28.980 --> 1:47:33.980]  Out of control, John Paul Yunkers of Europe?
[1:47:33.980 --> 1:47:39.980]  And they're sickening past. I mean, we're being told to give up our identity because it's bad
[1:47:39.980 --> 1:47:45.980]  and didn't become what? The truth is our real identity challenges tyranny.
[1:47:45.980 --> 1:47:51.980]  And so they want us to hate ourselves, but there's a rebirth of nationalism, of patriotism.
[1:47:51.980 --> 1:47:56.980]  Globalism is in crisis everywhere. But they're going to strike back.
[1:47:56.980 --> 1:48:06.980]  But first we've got to set the table with the massive migration away from the blue cities, their death rows that are in right now,
[1:48:06.980 --> 1:48:14.980]  and what comes out of that, and then what we see happening in Israel, happening in Europe, happening here,
[1:48:14.980 --> 1:48:20.980]  why they're so scared of Epstein. Who was Epstein really? What was he really doing?
[1:48:20.980 --> 1:48:24.980]  What was the Zorro Ranch? What was the eugenics? What was the breeding program?
[1:48:24.980 --> 1:48:29.980]  Well, we know pet projects of some of these globalists, and they're eugenics.
[1:48:29.980 --> 1:48:31.980]  I knew that before I knew about Epstein the sex stuff.
[1:48:31.980 --> 1:48:34.980]  I'd seen him involved with some of these globalists in bizarre behavior.
[1:48:34.980 --> 1:48:39.980]  So Dr. Pachinic, we'd run into break. You had predicted here, been on air 18 years with us,
[1:48:39.980 --> 1:48:46.980]  and if you predicted, I remember 15 years ago you'd say, oh, the northeast and the blue cities in the west,
[1:48:46.980 --> 1:48:49.980]  it's all going to collapse, it's all going to move there, and there's going to be, the EU's going to fall,
[1:48:49.980 --> 1:48:54.980]  their finishes and the Chai comms are going to have a big war with them, economic, maybe physical,
[1:48:54.980 --> 1:48:58.980]  the next 20 years they're going to lose, and I mean, that's all moving that direction.
[1:48:58.980 --> 1:49:00.980]  So please continue.
[1:49:00.980 --> 1:49:05.980]  Here's what happens. Epstein is an example of what happened in an institution.
[1:49:05.980 --> 1:49:10.980]  We're a republic, and Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats have had a real hard problem,
[1:49:10.980 --> 1:49:14.980]  and I had to instruct her through my videos that this is a republic.
[1:49:14.980 --> 1:49:18.980]  We are not a democracy. That means we're a representational government.
[1:49:18.980 --> 1:49:24.980]  We have constantly had all kinds of factors within our republic that we've had to fight against,
[1:49:24.980 --> 1:49:30.980]  and that's correct, Alex. The reason we're very strong is that we're not really a soft nation.
[1:49:30.980 --> 1:49:35.980]  We're a very ruthless, tough, no-nonsense nation.
[1:49:35.980 --> 1:49:40.980]  Part of that is the fact that within our own governments as a republic,
[1:49:40.980 --> 1:49:45.980]  we have to clean out those elements which are destructive to the people.
[1:49:45.980 --> 1:49:51.980]  For example, Epstein or the CIA, as I said, for a long time I have been against the CIA,
[1:49:51.980 --> 1:49:55.980]  only because they have served the purpose of the 1940s and 50s,
[1:49:55.980 --> 1:49:58.980]  and I will get to the history because it relates to Epstein.
[1:49:58.980 --> 1:50:04.980]  The CIA had to have a very close collaboration with another organization called the Mossad.
[1:50:04.980 --> 1:50:09.980]  Why the Mossad? Because the CIA was created by Filby, the Cambridge Five.
[1:50:09.980 --> 1:50:14.980]  Within the Cambridge Five, they were all homosexuals who had been at the University of Cambridge in England.
[1:50:14.980 --> 1:50:20.980]  One day, a gentleman by the name of Moise Diane came in and walked with James Jesus Angleton,
[1:50:20.980 --> 1:50:22.980]  who was head of our counterintelligence, and he said,
[1:50:22.980 --> 1:50:28.980]  Excuse me, but do you understand that your whole CIA has been infiltrated and created by communists?
[1:50:28.980 --> 1:50:34.980]  As a result of that, the Mossad helped the CIA clean out all of the Cambridge Five
[1:50:34.980 --> 1:50:38.980]  and then came in the Wasp, the White Anglo-Saxon Protestants,
[1:50:38.980 --> 1:50:41.980]  the Frank Wisness who created Mockingbird,
[1:50:41.980 --> 1:50:45.980]  the others who came in and decided that we had to infiltrate the press,
[1:50:45.980 --> 1:50:51.980]  we had to control the media, and basically we had all the writers, journalists on the CIA payroll.
[1:50:51.980 --> 1:50:57.980]  As a result of that, the next movement was to have what we call doubling behavior.
[1:50:57.980 --> 1:51:04.980]  That is to compromise major politicians here and overseas, and Prince Andrew,
[1:51:04.980 --> 1:51:10.980]  and use a man like Epstein, who was a little Jewish man of no significance from Brooklyn,
[1:51:10.980 --> 1:51:16.980]  the same thing we had with Dershowitz. These were all Brooklyn Jews who thought they were smarter than they were.
[1:51:16.980 --> 1:51:22.980]  They had no real education. Epstein had never gone to MIT, never gone to Harvard,
[1:51:22.980 --> 1:51:27.980]  but what happened was the Mossad really used him in conjunction with the CIA.
[1:51:27.980 --> 1:51:32.980]  That's why he has never been touched, and basically what he did,
[1:51:32.980 --> 1:51:37.980]  and this is what I was against for 40 years, and I warned the CIA, and I warned the Mossad,
[1:51:37.980 --> 1:51:41.980]  and I had arrested one of their operatives for two years after 9-11,
[1:51:41.980 --> 1:51:47.980]  that if you continue to infiltrate and destroy our republic, I will go after the Israeli operatives.
[1:51:47.980 --> 1:51:53.980]  And here is where the problem became. Epstein never died. He was never in prison.
[1:51:53.980 --> 1:51:58.980]  None of that is real. Unfortunately, Barr, who was our attorney general,
[1:51:58.980 --> 1:52:02.980]  it was his father that gave Epstein the job at the Dalton School,
[1:52:02.980 --> 1:52:06.980]  which was an all-girls school, and he taught mathematics.
[1:52:06.980 --> 1:52:12.980]  The rest is up to conjecture, but it's not, because I've been involved with the CIA
[1:52:12.980 --> 1:52:16.980]  and knew that they were highly compromised because of the Mossad.
[1:52:16.980 --> 1:52:23.980]  And as a result of that, the Israeli Mossad has used Epstein to compromise MIT professors,
[1:52:23.980 --> 1:52:30.980]  George Church, Minsky, even the president of MIT, Raphael Reif, who might set to him repeatedly.
[1:52:30.980 --> 1:52:35.980]  How can you still remain as president of MIT when you were compromised and you would end the problem?
[1:52:35.980 --> 1:52:42.980]  Let's expand on that. I mean, you've got Epstein advertising that he's got these advanced research programs,
[1:52:42.980 --> 1:52:46.980]  getting Billa Melinda Gates, getting Warren Buffett, getting Oprah Winfrey,
[1:52:46.980 --> 1:52:51.980]  getting Ted Turner at these secret institute meetings that came out in the news 15 years ago.
[1:52:51.980 --> 1:52:56.980]  That's how I knew about Epstein and the fact that in Zorro Ranch and these breeding programs,
[1:52:56.980 --> 1:53:01.980]  I mean, there's a lot of stuff this guy was on top of, a lot of weirdness.
[1:53:01.980 --> 1:53:05.980]  Well, the weirdness was part of it was created. He himself was weird.
[1:53:05.980 --> 1:53:10.980]  But the key element here to understand in our business of compromising people
[1:53:10.980 --> 1:53:15.980]  or doubling them up is that you never, never use children underage.
[1:53:15.980 --> 1:53:19.980]  When you double up an operatives and you use a honey trap,
[1:53:19.980 --> 1:53:25.980]  which is usually a woman for a man or a man for a homosexual, you do not use underage children.
[1:53:25.980 --> 1:53:29.980]  And this is where the CIA has to be held accountable and the Mossad.
[1:53:29.980 --> 1:53:34.980]  But this is where Gina Haspel has to be accountable and all the operatives have been involved.
[1:53:34.980 --> 1:53:37.980]  They're still around. They know exactly who they are.
[1:53:37.980 --> 1:53:41.980]  But because we do not have an effective attorney general, and I'm sorry,
[1:53:41.980 --> 1:53:46.980]  William Barr is not an effective attorney general. I find him highly compromised.
[1:53:46.980 --> 1:53:50.980]  I find the Department of Justice highly compromised so they can go all play around
[1:53:50.980 --> 1:53:54.980]  and make believe that they're indicting the FBI or call me.
[1:53:54.980 --> 1:53:58.980]  But the reality is once you're implicated in a problem,
[1:53:58.980 --> 1:54:03.980]  you can't get out of it. When Barr said, oh my God, Epstein committed suicide
[1:54:03.980 --> 1:54:07.980]  in the cell by himself, give me a break, will you?
[1:54:07.980 --> 1:54:11.980]  There's no such thing as committing suicide in a cell by yourself.
[1:54:11.980 --> 1:54:14.980]  And then in turn, the story even got more absurd.
[1:54:14.980 --> 1:54:19.980]  That's why you become important as the alternative media, but it's the real media.
[1:54:19.980 --> 1:54:22.980]  So where did Epstein go? Usually we take these operatives
[1:54:22.980 --> 1:54:25.980]  and we send them off to Paraguay or wherever else.
[1:54:25.980 --> 1:54:30.980]  He will never be held accountable, nor will the CIA, nor will the Mossad.
[1:54:30.980 --> 1:54:35.980]  And that's where people like myself come in and say, uh-uh, these days are finished.
[1:54:35.980 --> 1:54:37.980]  You can't get into this kind of stuff anymore.
[1:54:37.980 --> 1:54:43.980]  And then they'll say, oh, well, he's a Trumpite or he believes in conspiracies.
[1:54:43.980 --> 1:54:45.980]  And that's why my book couldn't be published.
[1:54:45.980 --> 1:54:48.980]  I have the William Mars Agency. They're nice people.
[1:54:48.980 --> 1:54:50.980]  We're going to get to that next hour because I want to spend a lot of time on your book.
[1:54:50.980 --> 1:54:54.980]  But let's just go back. It is true that the body they took out of the stretcher has a...
[1:54:54.980 --> 1:54:58.980]  And this was mainline photos, AP, you name it, is not the same ear.
[1:54:58.980 --> 1:55:00.980]  The ear doesn't even look halfway the same.
[1:55:00.980 --> 1:55:01.980]  Put that back on screen, please, guys.
[1:55:01.980 --> 1:55:04.980]  And that's from the photo the Daily Mail everybody ran.
[1:55:04.980 --> 1:55:08.980]  That is a real photo. And it's not even the same ear.
[1:55:08.980 --> 1:55:10.980]  It looks nothing like it.
[1:55:10.980 --> 1:55:13.980]  Sir, I mean, for a man... I mean, think of it for many.
[1:55:13.980 --> 1:55:16.980]  You know, you know the dynamics of suicide and other people.
[1:55:16.980 --> 1:55:19.980]  You can't commit suicide by yourself in a cell.
[1:55:19.980 --> 1:55:22.980]  I've run... I've run the Kremlin in saying war.
[1:55:22.980 --> 1:55:25.980]  Not with the paper sheets.
[1:55:25.980 --> 1:55:27.980]  No, of course not.
[1:55:27.980 --> 1:55:31.980]  And for William Barr to come up and to pronounce these nonsense
[1:55:31.980 --> 1:55:36.980]  and then say there was a storm of circumstances, this compromises Trump.
[1:55:36.980 --> 1:55:41.980]  So I would fire Barr and I've said all along where I find Trump is weak
[1:55:41.980 --> 1:55:45.980]  is he's not tough enough. I do not think he has people within the White House.
[1:55:45.980 --> 1:55:48.980]  Well, you said that about all of them two and a half years ago.
[1:55:48.980 --> 1:55:50.980]  So stay there. This is what I want to get into because you mentioned it.
[1:55:50.980 --> 1:55:53.980]  I want to finish up with the impeachment coup.
[1:55:53.980 --> 1:55:55.980]  What you think Trump needs to do.
[1:55:55.980 --> 1:55:58.980]  And then I want to get into your book because people aren't supposed to hear this.
[1:55:58.980 --> 1:56:02.980]  The big publishers that have published your other stuff, they wouldn't even touch it.
[1:56:02.980 --> 1:56:04.980]  This is just all part of the censorship and control.
[1:56:04.980 --> 1:56:06.980]  Dr. Steve Pachennick is our guest.
[1:56:06.980 --> 1:56:08.980]  StevePachennick.com is his website.
[1:56:08.980 --> 1:56:10.980]  We'll put a link to that up on infowars.com.
[1:56:10.980 --> 1:56:12.980]  Some of the other issues he's going to cover.
[1:56:12.980 --> 1:56:14.980]  Christianity today, that's blown up in their face.
[1:56:14.980 --> 1:56:18.980]  Facebook fascism, Mike Rogers, former NSA chief, he's got comments on that.
[1:56:18.980 --> 1:56:20.980]  John Durham in that investigation.
[1:56:20.980 --> 1:56:24.980]  Pelosi's downfall, corruption of Hollywood, mockingbird media,
[1:56:24.980 --> 1:56:27.980]  and how no one would publish Dr. Pachennick's book.
[1:56:27.980 --> 1:56:29.980]  And here is a copy of the new book.
[1:56:29.980 --> 1:56:31.980]  You find it at StevePachennick.com.
[1:56:31.980 --> 1:56:35.980]  American Warrior in Crisis, Tales of a Political Psychiatrist.
[1:56:35.980 --> 1:56:37.980]  We'll be back in the third hour.
[1:56:37.980 --> 1:56:42.980]  Please remember, most places in the U.S. you're not going to order today
[1:56:42.980 --> 1:56:45.980]  and get it before Christmas.
[1:56:45.980 --> 1:56:47.980]  About half the country can.
[1:56:47.980 --> 1:56:49.980]  Thank you for your support. That's why we're here.
[1:56:49.980 --> 1:56:51.980]  But you need to support yourself.
[1:56:51.980 --> 1:56:53.980]  You really need to get the products we've got.
[1:56:53.980 --> 1:56:56.980]  The reason our products have five stars on third-party review sites is
[1:56:56.980 --> 1:56:59.980]  we've got the best turmeric bodies.
[1:56:59.980 --> 1:57:02.980]  We've got really high-end fish oil and krill oil.
[1:57:02.980 --> 1:57:04.980]  Really good, new tropic rain force.
[1:57:04.980 --> 1:57:06.980]  Amazing, 10-hour clean energy in turbo force.
[1:57:06.980 --> 1:57:11.980]  We really have great tooth whitening and reminalization toothpaste.
[1:57:11.980 --> 1:57:14.980]  Super silver. We have the super blue with the tea tree,

[1:57:17.980 --> 1:57:19.980]  So it doesn't have a bad halogen in it.
[1:57:19.980 --> 1:57:20.980]  It's got the good halogen.
[1:57:20.980 --> 1:57:23.980]  We have the X2, the X3, M4warstore.com,

[1:57:28.980 --> 1:57:30.980]  This is clearance sales.
[1:57:30.980 --> 1:57:32.980]  You're not going to see sales like this ever again
[1:57:32.980 --> 1:57:34.980]  because in the new year we're not going to be able to discount things at this level.
[1:57:34.980 --> 1:57:37.980]  We're doing this at clearance at the end of the year.
[1:57:37.980 --> 1:57:40.980]  So please do your purchases at M4warstore.com and find the operation.

[1:57:45.980 --> 1:57:48.980]  M4war doesn't have an audience.
[1:57:48.980 --> 1:57:52.980]  We have listeners, men and women, who bleed red blood,
[1:57:52.980 --> 1:57:56.980]  who are part of the human race of every color, of every creed,
[1:57:56.980 --> 1:58:01.980]  who understand that evil is launching its full attack upon humanity now
[1:58:01.980 --> 1:58:05.980]  and who are ready to stand and fight against the globalist scourge.
[1:58:05.980 --> 1:58:08.980]  And I need all of you to realize that you're the best we've got.
[1:58:08.980 --> 1:58:10.980]  M4war is the best we've got.
[1:58:10.980 --> 1:58:12.980]  We're not perfect. We're fighting hard.

[1:58:17.980 --> 1:58:22.980]  Not just to expand in the face of the enemy, but just to stay on air.
[1:58:22.980 --> 1:58:26.980]  So I'm telling you, right now, I need you to step into the plate,

[1:58:31.980 --> 1:58:33.980]  The 12 days of Christmas is almost over.
[1:58:33.980 --> 1:58:36.980]  Some of the biggest sales of the year, take advantage of them,
[1:58:36.980 --> 1:58:40.980]  get store-wide free shipping, double-patriot points, and so much more.
[1:58:40.980 --> 1:58:43.980]  But whatever you do, do your shopping at M4warstore.com.
[1:58:43.980 --> 1:59:11.980]  Thank you and Merry Christmas.
[1:59:14.980 --> 1:59:19.980]  The globalists have sent in the clowns.
[1:59:19.980 --> 1:59:21.980]  They've sent in antifa.
[1:59:21.980 --> 1:59:25.980]  They've broken our borders with some of the most hardened criminals from around the world.
[1:59:25.980 --> 1:59:29.980]  They've tried to poison us with fluoride and GMO and the tainted vaccines.
[1:59:29.980 --> 1:59:31.980]  They've sent in their clowns.
[1:59:31.980 --> 1:59:36.980]  But now the men and women of America are taking action and confronting globalists everywhere.
[1:59:36.980 --> 1:59:39.980]  And I'm so proud of M4war's leading the charge.
[1:59:39.980 --> 1:59:43.980]  But the only way we can do that is when you keep spreading the word about our broadcast
[1:59:43.980 --> 1:59:46.980]  and when you keep buying the great products at M4warstore.com.
[1:59:46.980 --> 1:59:52.980]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:00:03.980 --> 2:00:07.980]  A big eight-page cover story this weekend from Bloomberg.
[2:00:07.980 --> 2:00:09.980]  Socialism. It's a dirty word again.
[2:00:09.980 --> 2:00:13.980]  Globalism, EU elites, technocracy falling apart.
[2:00:13.980 --> 2:00:16.980]  And falling apart very, very quickly.
[2:00:16.980 --> 2:00:19.980]  Dr. Steven Chenix, our guest, is a short five-minute segment.
[2:00:19.980 --> 2:00:20.980]  A little one-minute break coming up.
[2:00:20.980 --> 2:00:23.980]  I want to get back into Epstein and the impeachment in that segment.
[2:00:23.980 --> 2:00:29.980]  But let me go back to really toot your horn because it was at least 15 years ago.
[2:00:29.980 --> 2:00:32.980]  I've been interviewing you for five years that you were coming on going.
[2:00:32.980 --> 2:00:33.980]  And the EU is going to fall apart.
[2:00:33.980 --> 2:00:35.980]  There's going to be a giant movement at the top of that.
[2:00:35.980 --> 2:00:38.980]  And then the East Coast cities are going to start collapsing.
[2:00:38.980 --> 2:00:40.980]  And then they'll saturate with immigrants.
[2:00:40.980 --> 2:00:41.980]  But then that'll collapse.
[2:00:41.980 --> 2:00:43.980]  That's an LA Times today.
[2:00:43.980 --> 2:00:45.980]  And then there'll be a huge rebuilding.
[2:00:45.980 --> 2:00:48.980]  And then at a certain point, states like Texas will start dictating to Washington.
[2:00:48.980 --> 2:00:51.980]  And if they do things we don't like, we'll just not follow it.
[2:00:51.980 --> 2:00:56.980]  Well, I was having dinner with a retired person who actually worked for the Democrats.
[2:00:56.980 --> 2:01:00.980]  But they were saying, I mean, it'd be a well-known name for some folks.
[2:01:00.980 --> 2:01:03.980]  And they were talking about meeting with Governor Abbott, who I obviously know.
[2:01:03.980 --> 2:01:07.980]  And they've got a whole plan of things collapsed to just not follow what the feds say.
[2:01:07.980 --> 2:01:10.980]  The fact that so many states are in that position.
[2:01:10.980 --> 2:01:13.980]  And the fact that if Trump fails, the states have already prepared
[2:01:13.980 --> 2:01:17.980]  and are already linking up to just not go along with the blue cities.
[2:01:17.980 --> 2:01:21.980]  So you have the blue cities and the global is trying to impose power over everybody.
[2:01:21.980 --> 2:01:23.980]  Really is an act of weakness.
[2:01:23.980 --> 2:01:26.980]  How are you in the few minutes we have to break able to accurately chart that?
[2:01:26.980 --> 2:01:28.980]  And what do you chart coming next?
[2:01:28.980 --> 2:01:32.980]  It was very easy for me to chart it because, number one,
[2:01:32.980 --> 2:01:38.980]  the worst thing that the Northeast had in the Midwest and California was huge taxes.
[2:01:38.980 --> 2:01:44.980]  So what happens to hedge fund guys, the multimillionaires and the middle class all moved down to Florida.
[2:01:44.980 --> 2:01:47.980]  They moved down to Tennessee. They moved down to the South.
[2:01:47.980 --> 2:01:52.980]  They moved down to Texas, where there were no taxes and it was easier lifestyle.
[2:01:52.980 --> 2:01:57.980]  Number two, the power systems in Washington DC were no longer relevant.
[2:01:57.980 --> 2:02:02.980]  I've said for a long time, if Trump hadn't been there, we really wouldn't have needed a president.
[2:02:02.980 --> 2:02:06.980]  And the reality of what you're seeing now, forget the Epstein phenomenon,
[2:02:06.980 --> 2:02:12.980]  because that's the end of the CIA, the FBI and a whole bunch of people who attempted to have a coup there.
[2:02:12.980 --> 2:02:13.980]  It didn't work.
[2:02:13.980 --> 2:02:19.980]  The other part is the impeachment part where Nancy Pelosi is basically the joker in this movie.
[2:02:19.980 --> 2:02:23.980]  In her own mind, she thinks she's wonderful.
[2:02:23.980 --> 2:02:28.980]  This is her swan song, but this is the swan song to the entire House of Representatives
[2:02:28.980 --> 2:02:34.980]  because in a time where we really don't need representatives and an arcane model,
[2:02:34.980 --> 2:02:36.980]  we are working with the Internet.
[2:02:36.980 --> 2:02:39.980]  We're not a democracy. If we had a democracy, as Ross Barrow said,
[2:02:39.980 --> 2:02:44.980]  we would be punching our computers and just voting constantly on our own.
[2:02:44.980 --> 2:02:49.980]  So basically, the representational government will decrease in importance.
[2:02:49.980 --> 2:02:54.980]  The governors in the South, Abbott, DeSantis will become more important.
[2:02:54.980 --> 2:03:00.980]  And the governors in California, for example, where you have Nancy Pelosi doing a swan song
[2:03:00.980 --> 2:03:06.980]  and self-destructing with the Democrats in Washington at the same time they're self-destructing in California.
[2:03:06.980 --> 2:03:11.980]  How does she explain 85,000 homeless in San Francisco?
[2:03:11.980 --> 2:03:15.980]  Even the New York Times went out of its way to say, this is disgraceful.
[2:03:15.980 --> 2:03:19.980]  Look at the video. Then they have 85,000 homeless in Los Angeles.
[2:03:19.980 --> 2:03:24.980]  And now all the industry is pulling out and now no one's having conferences there.
[2:03:24.980 --> 2:03:28.980]  I mean, this is red line cardiac arrest.
[2:03:28.980 --> 2:03:31.980]  Correct. It's not only cardiac arrest, Alex.
[2:03:31.980 --> 2:03:36.980]  It's a self-destructive impulse that kept coming in again and again.
[2:03:36.980 --> 2:03:41.980]  You have multi-billionaires out of, you know, the high-tech areas in the Hollywoods.
[2:03:41.980 --> 2:03:43.980]  The Hollywood is finished.
[2:03:43.980 --> 2:03:49.980]  When you get a movie like The Irishman, which cost $180 million and it's junk,
[2:03:49.980 --> 2:03:54.980]  I vote for the Academy Awards and I'll vote for a movie like Harriet that cost $3 million,
[2:03:54.980 --> 2:04:00.980]  but $180 million for Robert De Niro, who doesn't even serve our country,
[2:04:00.980 --> 2:04:05.980]  who shoots his mouth off against the president, a man who's never had a formal education,
[2:04:05.980 --> 2:04:08.980]  a man who went to the red school, which is a communist school,
[2:04:08.980 --> 2:04:13.980]  never really could articulate anything or write anything decent, shoots his mouth off,
[2:04:13.980 --> 2:04:18.980]  or Robert Redford, who had no education and comes out of Santa Monica.
[2:04:18.980 --> 2:04:22.980]  This is what we had out of Hollywood. It's finished. It's gone.
[2:04:22.980 --> 2:04:26.980]  We have the Roku. We have streaming. So Hollywood is finished.
[2:04:26.980 --> 2:04:30.980]  California is finished. What's becoming important? Texas.
[2:04:30.980 --> 2:04:34.980]  I've always said Texas, in and of itself, could secede from the union
[2:04:34.980 --> 2:04:36.980]  and wouldn't need the rest of the union.
[2:04:36.980 --> 2:04:40.980]  Florida can secede from the union and wouldn't need the rest of the union.
[2:04:40.980 --> 2:04:45.980]  In effect, what I'm saying, de facto, the South has risen again.
[2:04:45.980 --> 2:04:51.980]  It has risen in a way that belied the lies of Abraham Lincoln and the Northeast establishment.
[2:04:51.980 --> 2:04:54.980]  Hold on. I've got to go to break. Back in 60s.
[2:05:22.980 --> 2:05:25.980]  I've had four shoulder surgeries and a back surgery,
[2:05:25.980 --> 2:05:28.980]  and that body has made me feel better than any type of physical therapy
[2:05:28.980 --> 2:05:30.980]  or anything that I've ever done in my life.
[2:05:30.980 --> 2:05:32.980]  So I just want to get that out of the way. Support this man.
[2:05:32.980 --> 2:05:35.980]  Everything that he exposed. Nobody knew about Bohemian Grove.
[2:05:35.980 --> 2:05:37.980]  Nobody knew about FD. Nobody knew about Bilderberg.
[2:05:37.980 --> 2:05:42.980]  Nobody called 9-11 before it happened in July 2001. Go look it up yourself.
[2:05:42.980 --> 2:05:45.980]  Well, we try our best, sir. They definitely want to stop the year without you or not here.
[2:05:45.980 --> 2:05:52.980]  But yeah, these are all great products, so thank you, sir.
[2:06:15.980 --> 2:06:22.980]  The corrupt in New York, a lot of great people live there with the establishment.
[2:06:22.980 --> 2:06:27.980]  The corrupt in Los Angeles and San Francisco are like dying cobras,
[2:06:27.980 --> 2:06:32.980]  fat on the blood of America, now angry that we're removing them from our throats
[2:06:32.980 --> 2:06:35.980]  until they just bite us again and again.
[2:06:35.980 --> 2:06:39.980]  The corrupt in New York, a lot of great people live there with the establishment.
[2:06:39.980 --> 2:06:44.980]  The corrupt in Los Angeles and San Francisco are like dying cobras, fat on the blood of America,
[2:06:44.980 --> 2:06:46.980]  they just bite us again and again.
[2:06:46.980 --> 2:06:51.980]  We already took the full load of poison, kind of grown used to it.
[2:06:51.980 --> 2:06:55.980]  In fact, it's what gets us out of bed in the morning.
[2:06:55.980 --> 2:07:00.980]  And all the intimidation, all the threats, it just doesn't work anymore because we were asleep.
[2:07:00.980 --> 2:07:03.980]  Now we're awake. They thought we were intimidated.
[2:07:03.980 --> 2:07:08.980]  No, we were just mesmerized by Hollywood, mesmerized by the left.
[2:07:08.980 --> 2:07:12.980]  And now people can't run away from it fast enough.
[2:07:12.980 --> 2:07:16.980]  All the metrics show the really young people, Generation Z.
[2:07:16.980 --> 2:07:21.980]  Not the millennials, some of them are awake, but mainly the new Generation Z, people under 20.
[2:07:21.980 --> 2:07:26.980]  They don't buy anything the system says. They can't stand the establishment.
[2:07:26.980 --> 2:07:30.980]  They want authenticity. They want real.
[2:07:30.980 --> 2:07:33.980]  And the establishment's now hitting all their emergency buttons.
[2:07:33.980 --> 2:07:37.980]  They admit that what Dr. C. Pachennick's been saying on this show for 15 years
[2:07:37.980 --> 2:07:42.980]  is just a wishful thinking. It's unfolding. So continue wherever you want to go now.
[2:07:42.980 --> 2:07:44.980]  I want to finish up with Epstein.
[2:07:44.980 --> 2:07:51.980]  And for me, the big story is the corporate media knew about Epstein, knew what was going on,
[2:07:51.980 --> 2:07:57.980]  cliently covered it up for 13 years, and that still the same groups are doing the same crap,
[2:07:57.980 --> 2:08:00.980]  the same payloads, the same procurement.
[2:08:00.980 --> 2:08:02.980]  That's what I want to be exposing tonight.
[2:08:02.980 --> 2:08:07.980]  And they're doing nothing. And the media has this and they're not just scared.
[2:08:07.980 --> 2:08:11.980]  They know you don't touch it. And so it's very, very shameful.
[2:08:11.980 --> 2:08:15.980]  And it'll be the nails in their political coffins.
[2:08:15.980 --> 2:08:19.980]  Anything else in that whole area of Epstein that I want to get into impeachment,
[2:08:19.980 --> 2:08:22.980]  the death rows of the Dems, but I don't want to be too confident because they could,
[2:08:22.980 --> 2:08:27.980]  they could, you know, certainly try to like a giant squid, you know, take us down with them.
[2:08:27.980 --> 2:08:33.980]  Not really. I mean, the Democratic Party, as it is now, is in the throes of death.
[2:08:33.980 --> 2:08:37.980]  I mean, Nancy Pelosi has really is singing a swan song.
[2:08:37.980 --> 2:08:41.980]  Her manipulation to try to get it into the Senate is not working.
[2:08:41.980 --> 2:08:46.980]  And basically that was her last swan song to say to somebody, I have no more power.
[2:08:46.980 --> 2:08:50.980]  And I'm playing the game and I'm playing bluffing.
[2:08:50.980 --> 2:08:55.980]  The real issue right now is that we will continue to exist.
[2:08:55.980 --> 2:08:59.980]  As you said, General Z, General, whatever the millennials are.
[2:08:59.980 --> 2:09:03.980]  But here in the South, I have young men and women who are in the Christian movement
[2:09:03.980 --> 2:09:07.980]  at the same time they serve in our National Guard at the same time they teach.
[2:09:07.980 --> 2:09:13.980]  So there's a whole generation of young men and women here in the South that will become our new leaders.
[2:09:13.980 --> 2:09:16.980]  They're very much like the Santas who was in the military.
[2:09:16.980 --> 2:09:19.980]  You're seeing more CIA operatives going into Congress.
[2:09:19.980 --> 2:09:24.980]  You see more military individuals, as I predicted, would go into the Congress and Senate.
[2:09:24.980 --> 2:09:29.980]  Once we have that, we have people who understand we can no longer go to war.
[2:09:29.980 --> 2:09:33.980]  We can't go to Vietnam. We can't go to Korea. We can't go to Iraq.
[2:09:33.980 --> 2:09:38.980]  We can't go to Afghanistan and listen to all these chicken hawks like the Bush juniors or the old.
[2:09:38.980 --> 2:09:42.980]  I'll elaborate on that because it's not combat veterans and people that want to start senseless wars.
[2:09:42.980 --> 2:09:44.980]  They want to get things fixed before that.
[2:09:44.980 --> 2:09:48.980]  It's only the chicken hawks that have never been in combat who are obsessed with it
[2:09:48.980 --> 2:09:53.980]  because they believe it's manly and tough and they make huge amounts of money out of directing it.
[2:09:53.980 --> 2:09:54.980]  Correct.
[2:09:54.980 --> 2:09:59.980]  And so we go back to, let's say, John F. Kennedy, who was totally psychotic at Addison's disease,
[2:09:59.980 --> 2:10:02.980]  had the greatest number of wars that anybody had ever seen.
[2:10:02.980 --> 2:10:07.980]  And of course, he was taken care of by a guy named Ford Meyer and others, Alan Dulles.
[2:10:07.980 --> 2:10:10.980]  We had LBJ, who had increased the war presence.
[2:10:10.980 --> 2:10:13.980]  And let me ask you that question because I want you to, because you're a psychiatrist,
[2:10:13.980 --> 2:10:18.980]  and you've studied JFK and you have the medical records and you know, run major memo awards and then look at Bobby.
[2:10:18.980 --> 2:10:24.980]  Why would the mafia put them in power and then why would they instantly turn on them?
[2:10:24.980 --> 2:10:31.980]  Because number one, you got to understand Joe Kennedy and what's happening now with the Epstein's,
[2:10:31.980 --> 2:10:39.980]  the Bronfmans and the Maxwell's were all part of the Jewish, Italian, Irish gang that came out of the Bronfmans
[2:10:39.980 --> 2:10:46.980]  making alcohol in Canada, transporting it through Joe Kennedy's trucks into Cleveland with Luciano
[2:10:46.980 --> 2:10:52.980]  and Meyer Lansky were then distributing it out to all of the distribution channels
[2:10:52.980 --> 2:10:57.980]  and basically that type of coalition has been there for years.
[2:10:57.980 --> 2:11:01.980]  That's why you had the Maxwell's involved in the Epstein case.
[2:11:01.980 --> 2:11:04.980]  You had the Bronfmans involved in the Epstein case.
[2:11:04.980 --> 2:11:09.980]  It was an antiquated system that was reignited by the CIA and the Mossad.
[2:11:09.980 --> 2:11:11.980]  Those days are gone.
[2:11:11.980 --> 2:11:17.980]  That's finished because the CIA and our intelligence systems really isn't all that good anymore.
[2:11:17.980 --> 2:11:22.980]  Gina Haskell has never been held accountable for torturing people.
[2:11:22.980 --> 2:11:27.980]  In other words, we have a system that really holds nobody accountable for anything.
[2:11:27.980 --> 2:11:29.980]  Gina Haskell has not been accountable for this.
[2:11:29.980 --> 2:11:31.980]  Epstein was not accountable.
[2:11:31.980 --> 2:11:34.980]  The people who ran Epstein is not accountable.
[2:11:34.980 --> 2:11:43.980]  The presidents who ran 9-11 and did a false flag in Iraq, in Afghanistan, Janie, Bush, Jr.
[2:11:43.980 --> 2:11:48.980]  Going back to Epstein, it's obviously being used as a set piece to try to blackmail
[2:11:48.980 --> 2:11:52.980]  in different power structures, but it is a big detonator that can blow them up
[2:11:52.980 --> 2:11:55.980]  because it obviously feeds into a whole bunch of different networks and groups.
[2:11:55.980 --> 2:11:58.980]  What are you expecting to happen with that? Where do you think that's going?
[2:11:58.980 --> 2:12:00.980]  What would you advise Trump to do?
[2:12:00.980 --> 2:12:03.980]  What I would advise Trump to do is fire half of the people.
[2:12:03.980 --> 2:12:08.980]  I've never seen so many people in the White House, particularly 2,000 people on the NSC.
[2:12:08.980 --> 2:12:09.980]  That is absurd.
[2:12:09.980 --> 2:12:14.980]  I would start getting rid of all of these people in the White House,
[2:12:14.980 --> 2:12:20.980]  decrease it from about 1,000 to a couple of hundred, the way James Baker ran it,
[2:12:20.980 --> 2:12:24.980]  the way it was run under the Schulz administration, a very tight administration.
[2:12:24.980 --> 2:12:26.980]  The Epsteins of the world have finished.
[2:12:26.980 --> 2:12:30.980]  There's no accountability, and they're not going to go back to an accountability
[2:12:30.980 --> 2:12:34.980]  because if they start that accountability, a lot of people would be in prison
[2:12:34.980 --> 2:12:37.980]  and they can't do it, and nor do they have the guts to do it.
[2:12:37.980 --> 2:12:41.980]  And Barr is going to be one of those people who would have to be held accountable
[2:12:41.980 --> 2:12:46.980]  for this nonsense to say, oh, yeah, well, we had a prison guard, but they were asleep.
[2:12:46.980 --> 2:12:47.980]  That's nonsense.
[2:12:47.980 --> 2:12:53.980]  So what we have right now is we have to keep going on and say, all right, where are we going from here?
[2:12:53.980 --> 2:12:56.980]  Well, Brexit, I got to give credit to Boris Johnson.
[2:12:56.980 --> 2:12:59.980]  He really came to a point that I didn't think was possible.
[2:12:59.980 --> 2:13:05.980]  And the reason Brexit occurred and I could predict it was that France was trying to neutralize Germany
[2:13:05.980 --> 2:13:08.980]  in the 1950s and they created the EU.
[2:13:08.980 --> 2:13:14.980]  The fact is that Germany was in two world wars, had really defeated France in two world wars,
[2:13:14.980 --> 2:13:20.980]  and once again in the 2020s, Germany is defeating France as an economic power.
[2:13:20.980 --> 2:13:24.980]  So France can never be a major economic force.
[2:13:24.980 --> 2:13:30.980]  And that's why a guy like Macron, who's the son or the offshoot of the Rothschild,
[2:13:30.980 --> 2:13:34.980]  and really is an effectual, he's an defeat leader, he's not going to lead anything.
[2:13:34.980 --> 2:13:42.980]  Whereas Angela Merkel, a PhD in nuclear physics can run Germany
[2:13:42.980 --> 2:13:45.980]  because Germany is a very tough country.
[2:13:45.980 --> 2:13:47.980]  It doesn't matter where they are and what they're going to do,
[2:13:47.980 --> 2:13:50.980]  they're going to be the primary force in the EU.
[2:13:50.980 --> 2:13:55.980]  But England will break away, Boris Johnson has been more effective than anybody else.
[2:13:55.980 --> 2:13:57.980]  He'll make an alliance with Trump.
[2:13:57.980 --> 2:14:03.980]  Trump in turn will bring him into the Canadian and Mexican agreement
[2:14:03.980 --> 2:14:07.980]  and then he will bring him into the China agreement where everybody said he couldn't do it.
[2:14:07.980 --> 2:14:09.980]  We're going to have an agreement with China.
[2:14:09.980 --> 2:14:14.980]  At the same time, we do have tensions with China and I predicted that in one of my books,
[2:14:14.980 --> 2:14:22.980]  Backspacifica, Bloodheed, I said that the Spratly Islands would be populated by the Chinese 20, 30 years ago.
[2:14:22.980 --> 2:14:25.980]  Well, the Chinese are all over South China Sea.
[2:14:25.980 --> 2:14:32.980]  And now they went into a country that I helped to create through the Bush administration and that was Cambodia.
[2:14:32.980 --> 2:14:36.980]  It was I who put Hansen, who's now been a leader there for 37 years.
[2:14:36.980 --> 2:14:42.980]  And we used to say then, 37 years ago, that the warmest part of Hansen was his glass eye.
[2:14:42.980 --> 2:14:44.980]  But he was a Khmer Rouge.
[2:14:44.980 --> 2:14:45.980]  I had Paul Pot.
[2:14:45.980 --> 2:14:46.980]  I had Q. Sampong.
[2:14:46.980 --> 2:14:51.980]  And we had to make a deal which was called the Paris Peace Accord, 1991,
[2:14:51.980 --> 2:14:54.980]  which I write all about in the book in detail.
[2:14:54.980 --> 2:15:01.980]  I had to bring back criminals to put them into a peace treaty along with Claude Moutin from France,
[2:15:01.980 --> 2:15:08.980]  the Russians who are very helpful and other countries that were helpful in putting together Cambodia.
[2:15:08.980 --> 2:15:15.980]  Now, whereas it's 37 years later, the Chinese came back and building airfields for their military jets,
[2:15:15.980 --> 2:15:18.980]  for their warships, and we're losing that.
[2:15:18.980 --> 2:15:24.980]  So we need a more sophisticated Secretary of State than Penn, than Pompeo.
[2:15:24.980 --> 2:15:28.980]  He's supposedly smart, but I haven't seen it.
[2:15:28.980 --> 2:15:30.980]  He tends to go into every field.
[2:15:30.980 --> 2:15:34.980]  He tends to have a short attention span in these fields, and then he leaves.
[2:15:34.980 --> 2:15:36.980]  He's not a strategist, although he's number one.
[2:15:36.980 --> 2:15:38.980]  Stay there. I want to get into this whole list of things.
[2:15:38.980 --> 2:15:42.980]  I want to get into your book, and I want to get into more of how you see the election
[2:15:42.980 --> 2:15:44.980]  and the impeachment and coup unfolding.
[2:15:44.980 --> 2:15:45.980]  We'll be right back.
[2:15:45.980 --> 2:15:46.980]  I'm Alex Jones.

[2:18:02.980 --> 2:18:04.980]  I'm not screwing around.
[2:18:04.980 --> 2:18:05.980]  I'm not joking.
[2:18:05.980 --> 2:18:07.980]  And neither are you.
[2:18:07.980 --> 2:18:12.980]  Infowars, and this operation we built together has delivered for America,

[2:18:17.980 --> 2:18:22.980]  and the GMOs and the deadly vaccine depopulation operation.
[2:18:22.980 --> 2:18:25.980]  What we're doing is beyond critical.
[2:18:25.980 --> 2:18:26.980]  And do you hear the key word?
[2:18:26.980 --> 2:18:31.980]  What we are doing is beyond critical.

[2:20:17.980 --> 2:20:18.980]  Thanks, Jones.
[2:20:18.980 --> 2:20:23.980]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[2:20:23.980 --> 2:20:39.980]  I've got a lot of questions for our guest.
[2:20:39.980 --> 2:20:43.980]  And in the last segment of the show, I'm going to open the phones up for like five, six people
[2:20:43.980 --> 2:20:44.980]  just to ask a quick question.
[2:20:44.980 --> 2:20:55.980]  The number is 877-789 Alex, 877-789-2539, 877-789 Alex.
[2:20:55.980 --> 2:20:58.980]  This is a short segment, longer segment coming up.
[2:20:58.980 --> 2:21:01.980]  I got so much to get into and I am going to read your book.
[2:21:01.980 --> 2:21:10.980]  Let's plow in to your new book and why Hollywood tried to suppress it and block it and why they're scared of it.
[2:21:10.980 --> 2:21:16.980]  I mean, I can't wait to read it, American Warrior in Crisis, Tales of a Political Psychiatrist.
[2:21:16.980 --> 2:21:18.980]  And it's got a wild cover.
[2:21:18.980 --> 2:21:20.980]  Dr. Pachennick.
[2:21:20.980 --> 2:21:27.980]  The cover was done by a very talented woman by the name of Renee.
[2:21:27.980 --> 2:21:31.980]  She was the granddaughter of Adrian Rogers, Renee Rogers.
[2:21:31.980 --> 2:21:38.980]  And Adrian Rogers, as many of you would know, was one of the premier Southern Baptists in this country.
[2:21:38.980 --> 2:21:47.980]  And one of the things that I think is important to understand is that Christianity is the fundamental concept or overlay faith in the United States.
[2:21:47.980 --> 2:21:51.980]  It's Judeo-Christian concepts that created this country.
[2:21:51.980 --> 2:21:52.980]  We're not Muslims.
[2:21:52.980 --> 2:21:54.980]  We're not Hindus.
[2:21:54.980 --> 2:21:58.980]  We welcome everybody, but you have to come in here and pay the price.
[2:21:58.980 --> 2:21:59.980]  So why did I write the book?
[2:21:59.980 --> 2:22:02.980]  I wrote a book about a kid who came from Cuba.
[2:22:02.980 --> 2:22:06.980]  He's Jewish from the Holocaust and comes into Harlem.
[2:22:06.980 --> 2:22:07.980]  And what does he do?
[2:22:07.980 --> 2:22:13.980]  I mean, does he either defeat and give up or go into a private school or whatever?
[2:22:13.980 --> 2:22:21.980]  And so this is the story of a young kid who goes up to Cornell on a scholarship because of the Republicans, thanks to Rockefeller,
[2:22:21.980 --> 2:22:25.980]  and goes to Cornell and finds out, wow, this school is not really all that great.
[2:22:25.980 --> 2:22:35.980]  As a matter of fact, the French course that he knows pretty well, they're still using textbooks, which were using tanks 20 years ago that were used for the French war.
[2:22:35.980 --> 2:22:40.980]  And the school itself didn't realize and doesn't want to criticize itself.
[2:22:40.980 --> 2:22:47.980]  Then he goes on to medical school at Cornell under a scholarship and turns out, wow, four years of med school, I didn't really need that.
[2:22:47.980 --> 2:22:48.980]  I've got dead cadavers.
[2:22:48.980 --> 2:22:52.980]  I'm looking at rats, but I really don't have the clinical practice that I need.
[2:22:52.980 --> 2:22:54.980]  And they're discriminatory.
[2:22:54.980 --> 2:22:58.980]  And at the same time, they are ruthless and sadistic.
[2:22:58.980 --> 2:23:09.980]  And now medical school suddenly becomes from an anti-Semitic, anti-Catholic, anti-woman, anti-Black school, becomes the wild medical school by Sandy Weil,
[2:23:09.980 --> 2:23:15.980]  who was a corrupt banker of Citibank and gives hundreds of millions of dollars.
[2:23:15.980 --> 2:23:21.980]  You're saying you got a real education about how crazy parts of the establishment had been because they weren't people that built the country.
[2:23:21.980 --> 2:23:24.980]  They had just taken over the power and you saw the megalomania.
[2:23:24.980 --> 2:23:25.980]  Exactly.
[2:23:25.980 --> 2:23:35.980]  And to this day, I still say to the president and Pollock, you know, why don't you come and do something honest instead of propagating the nonsense that you're doing at Cornell University?
[2:23:35.980 --> 2:23:37.980]  Well, suddenly I'm going to Harvard.
[2:23:37.980 --> 2:23:39.980]  And who was compromised at Harvard?
[2:23:39.980 --> 2:23:46.980]  Epstein and a guy, the president of Harvard, his name, Beko, who went to MIT and served under Raphael Wraith.
[2:23:46.980 --> 2:23:59.980]  And when I go to MIT, it was a formidable school because I was trained by Lucian Pye, by people, Howard Lazwell, politics and psychology, and by an institution called the CIA and Defense Advanced Research Project.
[2:23:59.980 --> 2:24:01.980]  I was trained by them, but I never belonged to them.
[2:24:01.980 --> 2:24:04.980]  So in the military, they made me a captain.
[2:24:04.980 --> 2:24:12.980]  And at the same time, I was a DAS and a medical doctor, but it allowed me because I tend to be bold and not self-righteous.
[2:24:12.980 --> 2:24:15.980]  I can come in and say to Jimmy Carter, look, you're not running the Hanafi Muslim.
[2:24:15.980 --> 2:24:18.980]  The Hanafi Muslim situation very well.
[2:24:18.980 --> 2:24:21.980]  I'm going to take it over and you can fire me or you can subordinate me.
[2:24:21.980 --> 2:24:29.980]  It doesn't matter, but I'm going to take out the 500 hostages that are out there where the FBI messed up and you messed up and then we're going to save them.
[2:24:29.980 --> 2:24:31.980]  And that's what happened.
[2:24:31.980 --> 2:24:36.980]  Then I come back under the Bush administration and the Reagan administration.
[2:24:36.980 --> 2:24:38.980]  I say, OK, I'll go down and see Noriega.
[2:24:38.980 --> 2:24:43.980]  And Noriega wants me, you know what, never become an ally of the United States.
[2:24:43.980 --> 2:24:50.980]  But he and I got along very well because he wanted to be a psychiatrist, but he couldn't afford to be a psychiatrist because he was too poor.
[2:24:50.980 --> 2:24:55.980]  But he warned me that there's going to be an invasion and Bush senior was going to do that.
[2:24:55.980 --> 2:24:56.980]  And guess what?
[2:24:56.980 --> 2:25:01.980]  There was an invasion and it was useless for the same reason that Bush senior went into Iraq.
[2:25:01.980 --> 2:25:02.980]  Useless.
[2:25:02.980 --> 2:25:04.980]  And what happens then?
[2:25:04.980 --> 2:25:11.980]  I go from Noriega and then I go on to the Maryland savings and loan where I see none other than Pelosi's family,
[2:25:11.980 --> 2:25:18.980]  a corrupt father, a corrupt brother, corrupt governor, corrupt bankers, corrupt SNLs.
[2:25:18.980 --> 2:25:21.980]  I take them all over and guess what happens?
[2:25:21.980 --> 2:25:24.980]  The guys from Drexel and others become again.
[2:25:24.980 --> 2:25:30.980]  They reconstituted through MIT and Harvard and all the institutions, but we don't hold anybody accountable.
[2:25:30.980 --> 2:25:32.980]  Nobody goes to jail.
[2:25:32.980 --> 2:25:36.980]  And I'm saying to myself, wow, this is amazing, this country.
[2:25:36.980 --> 2:25:44.980]  You can commit all kinds of crimes, but if you say anything about Obama, which I said on the radio, yeah, he's a CIA operative.
[2:25:44.980 --> 2:25:45.980]  That's fine with me.
[2:25:45.980 --> 2:25:46.980]  I don't care.
[2:25:46.980 --> 2:25:48.980]  But why don't you tell that to the American public?
[2:25:48.980 --> 2:25:52.980]  By the way, his mother's Ann Denim, who was also a CIA operative.
[2:25:52.980 --> 2:26:00.980]  And by the way, his maternal grandmother and grandfather worked for me at the East West Center in Hawaii and they were CIA bankers.
[2:26:00.980 --> 2:26:01.980]  And guess what I get?
[2:26:01.980 --> 2:26:07.980]  A $20,000 subpoena saying, I've got to go see the prosecutor in Florida.
[2:26:07.980 --> 2:26:16.980]  It cost me $20,000 in lawyers who were incompetent to address the fact that I had to deal with something called the Aldemarra kidnapping,
[2:26:16.980 --> 2:26:21.980]  which I had to deal with the fact that Aldemarra was assassinated by the Red Brigade.
[2:26:21.980 --> 2:26:23.980]  Was I involved or not?
[2:26:23.980 --> 2:26:26.980]  I won't go into the details, but I did what I had to do.
[2:26:26.980 --> 2:26:31.980]  And in fact, that was only the beginning of it, and then I had to take down the Soviet Union.
[2:26:31.980 --> 2:26:33.980]  Well, how do you take down the Soviet Union?
[2:26:33.980 --> 2:26:40.980]  Do you suddenly make expansive statements or do you become like the CIA and make believe you're shooting and non-shooting?
[2:26:40.980 --> 2:26:48.980]  Well, I turned out to spend a lot of time in the Soviet Union in the 70s because I was director of National Institute of Mental Health International Division,
[2:26:48.980 --> 2:26:57.980]  which was one position me, but I spent a lot of time with the KGB and I spent a lot of time with people in the psychiatric hospitals.
[2:26:57.980 --> 2:26:59.980]  And Kochenko and I write about that.
[2:26:59.980 --> 2:27:04.980]  And what the Soviets were doing was exactly what's happening to Christians all over the world.
[2:27:04.980 --> 2:27:13.980]  We talk about Jews having been persecuted, but I keep saying about Christians and why I spent my life trying to save them from barbaric institutions.
[2:27:13.980 --> 2:27:18.980]  The Kochenko psychiatric hospital put away Christians as political dissidents.
[2:27:18.980 --> 2:27:26.980]  And what I did was to commoditize those Christians and say to the head of this, who was Stalin's right-hand man,
[2:27:26.980 --> 2:27:29.980]  I'm going to give you, I'm going to commoditize Christianity.
[2:27:29.980 --> 2:27:33.980]  I'm going to give you five Wang computers for one Christian, six Wang computers for another.
[2:27:33.980 --> 2:27:35.980]  But I'm going to take out 20 different Christians.
[2:27:35.980 --> 2:27:37.980]  We're not going to say they're Christians.
[2:27:37.980 --> 2:27:42.980]  We're not going to say they're dissidents, but I'm going to give you Wang computers, and that's how it worked.
[2:27:42.980 --> 2:27:47.980]  And eventually I saw the fact that the Soviet Union wasn't really producing anything.
[2:27:47.980 --> 2:27:51.980]  You're saying underground Christian networks were key to the taking down the Soviet Union.
[2:27:51.980 --> 2:27:56.980]  And now Russia is becoming very Christian right now, and that enrages Hollywood.
[2:27:56.980 --> 2:28:03.980]  Well, the fact that, well, what shouldn't rage Hollywood and shouldn't rage all the Democrats is that they're too stupid to understand.
[2:28:03.980 --> 2:28:05.980]  We put in Vladimir Putin.
[2:28:05.980 --> 2:28:09.980]  I was involved in the takedown of the Soviet Union.
[2:28:09.980 --> 2:28:15.980]  And part of the Soviet Union, it's in the agreement 20 years ago, is Crimea.
[2:28:15.980 --> 2:28:18.980]  Russia did not invade Crimea.
[2:28:18.980 --> 2:28:21.980]  Crimea belongs to Russia for hundreds of years.
[2:28:21.980 --> 2:28:26.980]  So all this nonsense about the invasion of Crimea or the Ukraine.
[2:28:26.980 --> 2:28:30.980]  And a lot of this sounds like to people like, this guy sounds crazy, all these exaggerations,
[2:28:30.980 --> 2:28:32.980]  but I've actually looked at the history books.
[2:28:32.980 --> 2:28:34.980]  You did run the Camp David Accords, the only successful deal.
[2:28:34.980 --> 2:28:36.980]  You were involved with the Pol Pot stuff.
[2:28:36.980 --> 2:28:38.980]  You were involved with the Soviet Union.
[2:28:38.980 --> 2:28:40.980]  You've done all this stuff because you actually do work.
[2:28:40.980 --> 2:28:46.980]  Instead of sit around and talk about how you're an intelligence op and sit around on a bar bragging and patting each other on the back.
[2:28:46.980 --> 2:28:50.980]  Let's come back and talk about all this straight ahead and get into what's coming next.
[2:28:50.980 --> 2:29:19.980]  Let's move on with Dr. Steve Puccini.
[2:29:21.980 --> 2:29:28.980]  They'll immerse you into a 30 day program to replace your old habits with new habits and totally change your life.
[2:29:28.980 --> 2:29:33.980]  And if you have PPO, Private Health Insurance, the entire program may be covered.
[2:29:33.980 --> 2:29:36.980]  Fix your problem right now before it gets any worse.
[2:29:36.980 --> 2:29:37.980]  Get clean.
[2:29:37.980 --> 2:29:55.980]  Call now and learn more.
[2:29:55.980 --> 2:30:00.980]  I've got a problem that I want to confess to the listeners and viewers.
[2:30:00.980 --> 2:30:08.980]  I've been on the air so long that I take it for granted now when we break some massive story that changes the whole world.
[2:30:08.980 --> 2:30:14.980]  And that really does great things for the future of not just our children, but our children's children.
[2:30:14.980 --> 2:30:16.980]  Info Wars really has changed history.
[2:30:16.980 --> 2:30:24.980]  And that's why I need to pull back and ask the listeners, because I know you're a lot like me, to really think about a world without Info Wars.
[2:30:24.980 --> 2:30:32.980]  Because I can tell you right now, if people don't really step up to the plate and really financially support our broadcast going into 2020,
[2:30:32.980 --> 2:30:34.980]  we're not going to be on the air in a year or so.
[2:30:34.980 --> 2:30:42.980]  If you do support us, we're not just going to stay on the air, but we are going to expand in ways that are going to blow you away.
[2:30:42.980 --> 2:30:44.980]  I've never let you down.
[2:30:44.980 --> 2:30:45.980]  You've never let me down.
[2:30:45.980 --> 2:30:47.980]  Step up to the plate now.
[2:30:47.980 --> 2:30:48.980]  Go to infowarstore.com.
[2:30:48.980 --> 2:30:55.980]  Buy great products and fund our operation and watch us make history together again.
[2:30:55.980 --> 2:30:59.980]  We're closing out the year 2019.
[2:30:59.980 --> 2:31:02.980]  I don't have to tell you that 2020 is going to be a maker to break it.
[2:31:02.980 --> 2:31:05.980]  Not just for Info Wars, not just for America, but the whole world.
[2:31:05.980 --> 2:31:11.980]  We are in a battle between the forces of globalism that want to post human world and those that want to pro-human world.
[2:31:11.980 --> 2:31:13.980]  We're in a fight between Satan and Christ.
[2:31:13.980 --> 2:31:19.980]  And it's being played out amongst us mortals, but it's being directed from on high.
[2:31:19.980 --> 2:31:25.980]  And I'm just telling the listeners this broadcast, without you, we're going to lose this fight.
[2:31:25.980 --> 2:31:30.980]  I need all of you to realize how important you are and how important Info Wars is and what we've done together.
[2:31:30.980 --> 2:31:36.980]  And to just take stock and take measure at the end of the year and think about what you're going to do.
[2:31:36.980 --> 2:31:42.980]  Whether supporting Info Wars or buying products from us or starting your own show, just whatever you do, take action now.
[2:31:42.980 --> 2:31:44.980]  History is happening.
[2:31:44.980 --> 2:31:46.980]  Please do your Christmas shopping.

[2:32:03.980 --> 2:32:10.980]  At that critical game-changing moment, we have come through.
[2:32:10.980 --> 2:32:19.980]  And that means myself, the other hosts, the journalists, the researchers, the writers, the crew, down to the janitor, down to the bookkeeper.
[2:32:19.980 --> 2:32:25.980]  There is no top. There is no bottom. We are a family in this fight, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:32:25.980 --> 2:32:27.980]  And the stakes have never been higher.
[2:32:27.980 --> 2:32:29.980]  That's what the globalists want to take us out of the game.
[2:32:29.980 --> 2:32:33.980]  Only you keep Info Wars in the game.
[2:32:33.980 --> 2:32:35.980]  You are the Info War.
[2:32:35.980 --> 2:32:48.980]  And now, this Christmas, and come up to the end of the year, is the time to spend your money at InfoWarsTour.com to fund us into this next critical year of 2020 while getting great products that make your life and your family's life a lot better.

[2:33:18.980 --> 2:33:25.980]  Monday through Friday, from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., we're here live.
[2:33:25.980 --> 2:33:28.980]  Day to night, the morning is 8 a.m. on the shore of the war room.
[2:33:28.980 --> 2:33:30.980]  3 p.m. central every day.
[2:33:30.980 --> 2:33:38.980]  At 6 o'clock, we're going to air extended coverage of the Clinton body count documentary film at Band-Aid video and on the radio and TV satellite feeds.
[2:33:38.980 --> 2:33:40.980]  And I'll be there with you.
[2:33:40.980 --> 2:33:45.980]  And then sometime tonight or tomorrow morning, I'm going to release this bombshell FC information.
[2:33:45.980 --> 2:33:49.980]  All right, Dr. Pachinic, very interesting book.
[2:33:49.980 --> 2:33:52.980]  You've got a lot of best-selling books and never wanted to promote them on air.
[2:33:52.980 --> 2:34:03.980]  So I'm kind of picking up from this book that I haven't read yet that it's a memoir of a lot of the amazing things you witnessed that you saw from your very varied life and all the interesting places you've gone.
[2:34:03.980 --> 2:34:14.980]  And I would guess, you know, a lot of this bird's eye but also flying a wall level view is information that really nobody outside of a very few people has ever been privy to.
[2:34:14.980 --> 2:34:18.980]  So this is really a groundbreaking book.
[2:34:18.980 --> 2:34:20.980]  It's in many ways it's groundbreaking.
[2:34:20.980 --> 2:34:29.980]  It really is just a simple story, which I wanted to say, look, I'm a refugee, came to the United States, and I was asked to serve in this country.
[2:34:29.980 --> 2:34:33.980]  And I said, fine, I'm more than happy to serve.
[2:34:33.980 --> 2:34:37.980]  I was the only one who was drafted out of 88 doctors in my medical school.
[2:34:37.980 --> 2:34:38.980]  And I knew that.
[2:34:38.980 --> 2:34:43.980]  And I said, fine, if I'm going to serve, let me tell you what, I want to be the best educated cadaver.
[2:34:43.980 --> 2:34:48.980]  And they sent me to med school, residency and MIT.
[2:34:48.980 --> 2:34:51.980]  And as a result, I served the military.
[2:34:51.980 --> 2:34:59.980]  I was at a rank for about 10 seconds of rear admiral, but I never accepted a uniform or never accepted a rank and I didn't want to get paid.
[2:34:59.980 --> 2:35:06.980]  And to this day, I still work with different elements of the intelligence community because that's my service and I'm proud to get it.
[2:35:06.980 --> 2:35:08.980]  Here's the next thing I want to get at.
[2:35:08.980 --> 2:35:19.980]  Give us your gestalt or approximation of the current battlefield state, who the main blocks are, what Trump's doing right and wrong, because this is beyond censorship.
[2:35:19.980 --> 2:35:25.980]  Big Tech now has AI in control, blocking photos of millennia saying it's hate, blocking photos of yours truly.
[2:35:25.980 --> 2:35:30.980]  Women at the shooting range, women saying they like Trump, they're being blocked, they're being told you'll be banned.
[2:35:30.980 --> 2:35:41.980]  So there's real beyond 1984 surveillance in place, they're blocking the political advertising while letting Democrats operate advertising under the guise of news.
[2:35:41.980 --> 2:35:46.980]  Sure, the Republicans have raised more money, but they can't spend it because they won't let them.
[2:35:46.980 --> 2:35:47.980]  This is fundamental tyranny.
[2:35:47.980 --> 2:35:50.980]  So I get you don't interrupt your enemy when they're destroying themselves.
[2:35:50.980 --> 2:35:51.980]  The Democrats are in trouble.
[2:35:51.980 --> 2:35:52.980]  It's blowing up their face.
[2:35:52.980 --> 2:35:59.980]  I understand that, but we're barely able to stay on air and we were a bigger organization that had other ways of getting stuff out.
[2:35:59.980 --> 2:36:01.980]  Everybody else is being destroyed.
[2:36:01.980 --> 2:36:05.980]  Trump keeps saying he's going to do something, but we're not seeing that.
[2:36:05.980 --> 2:36:07.980]  Meanwhile, Big Tech, as you know, has moved to China.
[2:36:07.980 --> 2:36:09.980]  They've demanded the code keys.
[2:36:09.980 --> 2:36:10.980]  Apple already did it.
[2:36:10.980 --> 2:36:20.980]  Now next week's the deadline, the new year, where any company in China has to basically give access to their members files.
[2:36:20.980 --> 2:36:22.980]  They're talking about a national security crisis.
[2:36:22.980 --> 2:36:26.980]  And of course, I'm sure there's some plan to have stuff that sets the Chinese up within that.
[2:36:26.980 --> 2:36:27.980]  I'm sure it's a trap.
[2:36:27.980 --> 2:36:30.980]  But still, this is all just incredibly out of control.
[2:36:30.980 --> 2:36:33.980]  And I get we're going into a war footing with China.
[2:36:33.980 --> 2:36:34.980]  That's good.
[2:36:34.980 --> 2:36:42.980]  But beyond Huawei, Apple basically acts like, you know, worse than Huawei and then Trump's parading around with Tim Cook.
[2:36:42.980 --> 2:36:44.980]  I don't disagree with you.
[2:36:44.980 --> 2:36:53.980]  And that's one of the problems I've had with Trump that he isn't strong enough to demand a new personnel in the White House and fewer.
[2:36:53.980 --> 2:37:00.980]  One of the one of the elements that's coming to the forefront in our administration and in the Trump administration.
[2:37:00.980 --> 2:37:06.980]  I can't go into detail for other reasons is the fact that we're getting into cyber command and cyber control.
[2:37:06.980 --> 2:37:17.980]  In the beginning for the past 10 years before I was involved with a gentleman by the name of Keith Alexander, who was really the father of cyber control and cyber command at the NSA.
[2:37:17.980 --> 2:37:26.980]  Then it was given over to Admiral Mike Rogers, who did a brilliant job. He came out of the Navy and he was the one who said, look, this is what the reality is.
[2:37:26.980 --> 2:37:27.980]  This is where we're headed.
[2:37:27.980 --> 2:37:28.980]  And this is where we're going.
[2:37:28.980 --> 2:37:32.980]  And now we have a general Nakasone who's involved in cyber command.
[2:37:32.980 --> 2:37:44.980]  I can't go into the total details, but I can say this, that the problem of the present companies that are too large and too big and out of control is real.
[2:37:44.980 --> 2:37:50.980]  And if they continue, there will be legislation and there will be demands from within the government.
[2:37:50.980 --> 2:38:04.980]  And it will come from the military side of the government, which is also civilian because cyber command now brings in both civilian and military elements to say, OK, you guys have too much power and we're going to start breaking it up.
[2:38:04.980 --> 2:38:08.980]  And that's what you're going to expect to see in terms of Facebook.
[2:38:08.980 --> 2:38:10.980]  That's what Zuckerberg has to face.
[2:38:10.980 --> 2:38:15.980]  You're going to see that with respect to Google, which is totally out of control.
[2:38:15.980 --> 2:38:22.980]  And the irony was I brought in the founders of it from the Soviet Union when they were just kids, seven years old.
[2:38:22.980 --> 2:38:27.980]  Now I'm monitored and I'm demonetized as you are.
[2:38:27.980 --> 2:38:28.980]  And here's the irony.
[2:38:28.980 --> 2:38:35.980]  You bring in those very people who are now going to create the very element that might destroy me or you.
[2:38:35.980 --> 2:38:42.980]  But at the same time, I have full faith that we can continue now and that Trump will be stronger in the next administration.
[2:38:42.980 --> 2:38:44.980]  I believe he will be elected.
[2:38:44.980 --> 2:38:48.980]  I believe the impeachment has no relevance whatsoever than a lot of noise.
[2:38:48.980 --> 2:39:04.980]  But at the same time, we do have to deal with the Chinese aggression in terms of 5G artificial intelligence who away and the inner relationships that we have between our big government, big corporations and their corporations.
[2:39:04.980 --> 2:39:06.980]  Sure. What's the space force?
[2:39:06.980 --> 2:39:11.980]  And what you're saying is there's a million people with the top security clearance in our corporations.
[2:39:11.980 --> 2:39:16.980]  It's just like William Benny says, the NSA is built for everybody to go into it secretly.
[2:39:16.980 --> 2:39:18.980]  That's the big national security threat.
[2:39:18.980 --> 2:39:23.980]  Sure, it was the bureaucracy play God, but now they've given up any real power they have to centralize state actors.
[2:39:23.980 --> 2:39:28.980]  And why the hell would they build a Swiss cheese, you know, backdoor labyrinth into everything?
[2:39:28.980 --> 2:39:30.980]  It needs to be reversed.
[2:39:30.980 --> 2:39:35.980]  I agree with you. Number one, the NSA is not the predominant power anymore.
[2:39:35.980 --> 2:39:40.980]  You have to go to an institution that's been created about nine to ten years ago.
[2:39:40.980 --> 2:39:43.980]  Clapper, ironically, was the first director, but he's not anymore.
[2:39:43.980 --> 2:39:46.980]  And that is the National Geospatial Agents.
[2:39:46.980 --> 2:39:50.980]  Sure. And that brings us next to the space force, which is really space command.
[2:39:50.980 --> 2:39:55.980]  And of course, that's really a whole other separate, I would say, breakaway government or shadow government.
[2:39:55.980 --> 2:40:05.980]  I mean, from my perspective, what is space force? We know it's a bunch of different elements that Trump is trying to now make into a new branch of the military.
[2:40:05.980 --> 2:40:08.980]  How would you quantify what space force is?
[2:40:08.980 --> 2:40:14.980]  I would quantify it as saying it's the counter force to the civilian equivalent of NASA.
[2:40:14.980 --> 2:40:26.980]  NASA was a primary base under which guys like, you know, Boeing could come in and create their starship, but it didn't work.
[2:40:26.980 --> 2:40:33.980]  And that was a basis for which private corporations, even some government corporations, could send up a rocket.
[2:40:33.980 --> 2:40:37.980]  But space force has a very strong element of the military aspect.
[2:40:37.980 --> 2:40:48.980]  And what I mean by military is right now we have in space all kinds of satellites really shooting and attacking each other for quite some time.
[2:40:48.980 --> 2:40:55.980]  And we don't talk about it, but honestly, we do need a component where we have our own rockets.
[2:40:55.980 --> 2:40:58.980]  We're not as dominant as we were. The Chai comms are destroying our satellites.
[2:40:58.980 --> 2:41:01.980]  We need to have somebody go out there and wipe a bunch of them out.
[2:41:01.980 --> 2:41:15.980]  Well, we were not dominant for many years. As a matter of fact, I was shocked that for 20 years from Montana onward, in order to launch a satellite into space, we had to pay the Russians about $75 million.
[2:41:15.980 --> 2:41:19.980]  And again, that's sabotage. Why do we get rid of the Saturn rocket plans and all that?
[2:41:19.980 --> 2:41:22.980]  I mean, there's been clear sabotage at NASA.
[2:41:22.980 --> 2:41:31.980]  I can't tell you the specifics of it. NASA has its own bureaucracy, which is quite huge and it's located in Titusville.
[2:41:31.980 --> 2:41:36.980]  I know something about it, but I can't pretend to say that I really know a lot about it.
[2:41:36.980 --> 2:41:48.980]  And at this particular point, I do know that we're shifting over to the NGA, we're shifting over to cyber command, we're shifting over to a militarized space unit, which is not related.
[2:41:48.980 --> 2:41:54.980]  So that's one way for Trump not to just fire everybody. He can just create new clean groups and then cut the funding for the others.
[2:41:54.980 --> 2:42:05.980]  Well, that's correct. But at the same time, he does have to start firing and that cannot. He has to have somebody inside who can say no, no, no, this has to be cut.
[2:42:05.980 --> 2:42:12.980]  You can't have 75,000 people at the State Department. It's an antiquated institution.
[2:42:12.980 --> 2:42:18.980]  Even though I enjoy the Foreign Service office, I really don't need political ambassadors.
[2:42:18.980 --> 2:42:23.980]  Well, if anybody knows, even in their business or their household or anywhere, if you get too many people, no work gets done.
[2:42:23.980 --> 2:42:26.980]  They all just have bureaucratic meetings and mess with each other all day.
[2:42:26.980 --> 2:42:29.980]  We're going to come back and take calls with great questions for Dr. Steve Pachinick.
[2:42:29.980 --> 2:42:37.980]  And I'm going to ask him more about, because he's not got to make stuff up about having a hand taking out that particular Israeli prime minister back in the early 1990s.
[2:42:37.980 --> 2:42:43.980]  I'm going to ask him about that a little bit more. And then, Gerald Salente, always informative, is coming up.
[2:42:43.980 --> 2:42:49.980]  And then, six o'clock tonight, I'm going to be back live with the Clinton body count documentary.
[2:42:49.980 --> 2:42:52.980]  And then we're going to drop the big Epstein bomb shells. Stay with us.
[2:42:52.980 --> 2:42:58.980]  The best product. I'm not supposed to be biased, but I'm going to tell you all now, if you haven't tried turbo force, you need to try it.
[2:42:58.980 --> 2:43:04.980]  I've tried turbo force with everything. Sometimes, you know, I went a little bit crazy. I put turbo force in my coffee.
[2:43:04.980 --> 2:43:09.980]  That was a crazy week. I don't remember sleeping, but as far as the products go, turbo force is my favorite.
[2:43:09.980 --> 2:43:16.980]  And all the Infowars products are down to taking control of your life, taking control of your health, not relying on other people to do it for you.
[2:43:16.980 --> 2:43:22.980]  Nobody wakes up in the morning and thinks, I'm going to give that person over there a better life.
[2:43:22.980 --> 2:43:28.980]  I'm going to wake up today. You know, I'm going to spend my entire day trying to make that guy over there healthier, happier and richer.
[2:43:28.980 --> 2:43:30.980]  I'm going to make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend.
[2:43:30.980 --> 2:43:35.980]  I don't think that happens very often. It's never happened to me. I've never had anyone knock on my door and said, Tate, you're such a good guy.
[2:43:35.980 --> 2:43:37.980]  How can I improve your life in every single way?
[2:43:37.980 --> 2:43:41.980]  There's only one person who woke up and thought that, and that was me. I woke up and thought, you know what?
[2:43:41.980 --> 2:43:44.980]  Okay, I want to take control of my life. I want to take control of my health.
[2:43:44.980 --> 2:43:48.980]  And that's why you need to go to Infowars.com. Take control of your health right now and support the resistance.
[2:43:48.980 --> 2:43:51.980]  Don't buy into the group thing. Don't drink the Kool-Aid. Drink the turbo force.
[2:43:51.980 --> 2:43:53.980]  Kool-Aid's bad and the turbo force is good.
[2:43:53.980 --> 2:44:01.980]  It's your last chance to get the original designer limited edition Jeffrey Epstein Christmas sweater.
[2:44:01.980 --> 2:44:14.980]  The globalists are so scared of this story continuing to come out for people learning about the deep state and the international blackmail rings using kidnap women and children to compromise world leaders.
[2:44:14.980 --> 2:44:27.980]  They do not want this story continuing. And this is your last chance to get the limited edition Christmas sweater at InfowarsStore.com to help spread the word, to have a piece of history, and to fund our operation.
[2:44:27.980 --> 2:44:33.980]  So again, it says Christmas lights are a lot like Epstein. These things don't hang themselves on the front.
[2:44:33.980 --> 2:44:39.980]  On the back, it's got Infowars.com and shows the O in Infowars as a wreath. It's also a noose.
[2:44:39.980 --> 2:44:47.980]  The system can't stand it when you promote things to grassroots level. They can't stand it when you fund independent pro America, pro human media.
[2:44:47.980 --> 2:44:51.980]  That's why you've got to take advantage of this shirt and get it today.
[2:44:51.980 --> 2:45:13.980]  Well, there goes Christmas 2019 and we're plunging into 2020 as we speak. And as 2019 collapses into dust and the baby of 2020 is born, now is the time to realize how critical this year is for all of our futures.

[2:47:14.980 --> 2:47:22.980]  Doc, you were bringing up Yishak Rabin and his assassination early on and what happened there.
[2:47:22.980 --> 2:47:29.980]  And then I guess that started a long train of the Likudniks getting back into power. And you were saying you had a hand in that? That's quite a statement.
[2:47:29.980 --> 2:47:44.980]  Well, the statement is this. I had gone to see him as an officer of the State Department. Because I was a psychiatrist and I was with someone else I don't want to identify, I basically saw clinically that he was exceedingly depressed.
[2:47:44.980 --> 2:47:53.980]  And I asked him, is there anything we can do to help you? And he was just slow talking, slow movement and all of that.
[2:47:53.980 --> 2:48:03.980]  And I mentioned it to somebody I do not want to identify who's dead now, who is one of the key operatives in the Mossad. And he worked in the United States.
[2:48:03.980 --> 2:48:16.980]  And I said, you know, you've got to deal with this prime minister. And it wasn't an assassination that I had in mind. On the contrary, I was thinking of, you know, asking him to leave and then treating him.
[2:48:16.980 --> 2:48:33.980]  But the reality was that it's her being knew very well that he was totally depressed. And when he was asked actually by the Shin Bet, the head of the Shin Bet, as I understand, you know, do you want anything to protect you or, you know,
[2:48:33.980 --> 2:48:49.980]  bodyguards. And it was revolving around the Oslo agreement. And I was not involved in the Oslo agreement. I didn't think it was much of anything. It was just a lot of who had that Clinton and Dennis Ross and others created, which wasn't equal to what was done in Camp David Accord.
[2:48:49.980 --> 2:49:06.980]  And Rabi said no, he didn't want bodyguards and he didn't want a bulletproof vest. And that was the last I had heard about it. And I knew very well when the assassination occurred and it was supposedly over the Oslo agreement and support.
[2:49:06.980 --> 2:49:21.980]  I knew that wasn't really the case. But be it as it may, that was an indirect way of saying, you know, there was a problem in Israel and they had to deal with it. Now, Israel has this problem right now with BB.
[2:49:21.980 --> 2:49:43.980]  And I've said it many times before. His father was one of my teachers at Cornell University. He was, I think, early out of control. BB is a total narcissist, self-aggrandizing. He's kind of a quasi-terrorist who's holding Israel hostage to his narcissism and the fact that he's fearful he's going to go to prison.
[2:49:43.980 --> 2:49:57.980]  Well, he's corrupt. His wife is corrupt. That's obvious. And Benny Gatz, who is the far more serious candidate and is a general in the Israeli army, was the chief of the Israeli army, should have really been the leader.
[2:49:57.980 --> 2:50:17.980]  But BB is so self-centered that he realizes that only his narcissism is what's key to the state of Israel. And in fact, the state of Israel really has to get rid of BB and continue to be what it was and is a formidable high-tech company which produces an incredible amount.
[2:50:17.980 --> 2:50:24.980]  Okay, well, why then do we see, like, the Rothschild economists, everybody want BB out? I mean, what's the fight going on there?
[2:50:24.980 --> 2:50:39.980]  I didn't know the Rothschilds want him out. I don't know very much about the Rothschilds per se, but basically the people who want him out is the fact that he is a corrupt individual and he doesn't want to face that.
[2:50:39.980 --> 2:50:43.980]  What about Ehud Barak hanging out with Epstein? Was he managing honey traps?
[2:50:43.980 --> 2:51:01.980]  Now we have a very interesting story. Ehud Barak was highly compromised and he had been in intelligence. He was in the military. And once again, when you are dealing with the Israeli Mossad and you're dealing with Maxwell, who was a Jewish immigrant from the Holocaust,
[2:51:01.980 --> 2:51:15.980]  and basically was one of the key elements in the Mossad working with Epstein as his daughter, Giselle McKenzie, who they can't find. I mean, in all of America, the woman who pimps from Epstein, you can't find her.
[2:51:15.980 --> 2:51:27.980]  That's an amazing phenomenon. That has the credibility of the fact that Epstein, you know, killed himself. So, again, we have this issue of credibility. We have this issue of, you know, consequences.
[2:51:27.980 --> 2:51:39.980]  And we're not a country who follows through. And in a way, Israel is trying to follow through because they're saying, you know what, you're going to jail, BV, no matter what, you're going to end up in jail and we're going to throw you out.
[2:51:39.980 --> 2:51:47.980]  So, eventually, I predict that BV is going to leave and Benny Gantz will take over and hopefully Israel will turn around.
[2:51:47.980 --> 2:51:54.980]  Alright, let's take a phone call here. Sean in New Jersey, you've got a question for Buchenne. Go ahead.
[2:51:54.980 --> 2:52:06.980]  Thank you, brother. I would like to say Merry Christmas and Happy Hanukkah and God bless the both of you, sir. I thank you so much for coming forward. You have no idea what it means to have us hear from you.
[2:52:06.980 --> 2:52:09.980]  Go ahead and get your questions. Thanks, Sean.
[2:52:09.980 --> 2:52:28.980]  My question is, is there anything that we, the people, the oath keepers, former military, law enforcement, is there anything we can do to come together to show President Trump that no matter what, we're with him so he can start expediting his...
[2:52:28.980 --> 2:52:33.980]  What do we do to get Trump to get tough and go after the deep state and not just put up with their crap?
[2:52:33.980 --> 2:52:45.980]  That's an excellent point. I think you should all get together within your own groups and start writing letters and, you know, sending Twitter or however you want to communicate to Trump that.
[2:52:45.980 --> 2:52:52.980]  We support him, but we need to have a tougher approach in the next administration. We start to have, we have to start cleaning up the place.
[2:52:52.980 --> 2:53:08.980]  And by the way, he does listen to the people and a lot of it gets to him. He's everybody. I mean, you have a chance with this president, he actually values what the general public says. That's a fact. And so, absolutely, you've got to go bullhorn the White House, go to his events, stand in line, hand him a letter. It really works.
[2:53:08.980 --> 2:53:19.980]  It does work. And I think what Alex said to you is exactly correct. And I know people here in the South who do go to his rallies and they do attend and they do send in messages.
[2:53:19.980 --> 2:53:30.980]  But I think the oathkeepers should get together and as an entity to really say, look, we want a tougher government. We want a smaller government. We're paying our taxes. We want fewer taxes.
[2:53:30.980 --> 2:53:41.980]  And we don't want as many people in the government. So let's start firing. And one of the things we do want is an infrastructure capacity where we're repairing our bridges and we're repairing our roads.
[2:53:41.980 --> 2:53:51.980]  We've been trying that and the Democrats have literally been blocking it. Thank you, Sean. Great question. Jeff's got a question in Texas. Jeff, you're on the air with Dr. Steve Pachennick of StevePachennick.com. Go ahead, Jeff.
[2:53:51.980 --> 2:54:08.980]  Hey, yeah, I just want to say I love listening when Dr. Pachennick's on. I think he's the best guest you got, Alex. Anyway, if we get rid of the CIA like you were talking about, Dr. Pachennick, what do we do in terms of knowing what other nations are doing since other nations are going to continue to spy on us?
[2:54:08.980 --> 2:54:23.980]  We just have a unified presidential and congressional directive of the mission that have it through the five different military agencies and then basically scale it back and then actually only act on real issues instead of trying to be a huge bureaucratic control arm and me snooping on everything.
[2:54:23.980 --> 2:54:35.980]  Well, you have a point. It's not just getting rid of the CIA. We have 16 different intelligence units that really don't work together. And then we have a 17th element, the DNI that was created after 9-11.
[2:54:35.980 --> 2:54:45.980]  We don't need that. What I need is one integrated force, which really brings it all together and uses human. We're not very good in human. I have to tell you that.
[2:54:45.980 --> 2:54:56.980]  Over the years, after about the Reagan administration, we really did not concentrate on our ability to understand dynamics and possible outbreaks.
[2:54:56.980 --> 2:55:08.980]  And you, too, as you know, I mean, just 30 years ago, the professionals, the corporate people, the doctors, everything was leveraged into humance against the Soviets and others, and we were dominant because our professionals were all doing stuff.
[2:55:08.980 --> 2:55:20.980]  Now, literally, the so-called intelligence class is a bunch of delusional, like I said, narcissist on power trips, imagining themselves like some fictitious James Bond character. It's ridiculous.
[2:55:20.980 --> 2:55:38.980]  I agree with you. Let me give you an example. The reason I was trained in both psychiatry and politics was because Harold Lazwell, Lucian Pine and others at MIT and elsewhere, University of Chicago and Yale, had created a specialty called political psychology or political psychiatry.
[2:55:38.980 --> 2:55:49.980]  We need more of those people. And ironically, Yale University, which comes back and always criticizes the president, is the very source of that political psychology.
[2:55:49.980 --> 2:56:02.980]  And let me stop you there. We may have to do two more segments if you can stay to get to all these calls. We've got to go understand. But just pulling back, so much of America's power is exporting our good ideas and then helping build infrastructure and really helping people.
[2:56:02.980 --> 2:56:14.980]  It's not acting tough and killing people and, you know, all of this stuff. It's actually promoting Americana. But if we lose that Americana and that pioneering spirit and don't export that, we're dead.
[2:56:14.980 --> 2:56:18.980]  It's our spirit that's dominant that we need to rekindle.
[2:56:18.980 --> 2:56:29.980]  I agree with you. But I see that, again, I see it within the Christian fundamentalist community. And that's why when I saw the comment from one of Billy Graham's magazines, I knew that was not the Graham family.
[2:56:29.980 --> 2:56:38.980]  That's where I wanted to go next, because it was the Christian evangelicals that helped bring down the Soviet Union, as you know. And when I was a kid, I watched them being leveraged in Dallas against the Soviet Union, a great effect.
[2:56:38.980 --> 2:56:46.980]  I didn't know you were on the other end of that. But I saw it as a child growing up. And that's why the globalist fear Christians so much is they know we'll kick their ass.
[2:56:46.980 --> 2:56:58.980]  Well, it's not only that, there is a real problem of Christianity being killed. There are over two million Christians have been slaughtered, Chaldeans, Assyrians, Coptic.
[2:56:58.980 --> 2:57:09.980]  I go into Egypt, I remember years ago, and I would say to the Egyptian leaders, this is 10, 20 years ago, you've destroyed 10 Coptic places of worship.
[2:57:09.980 --> 2:57:17.980]  And then years later, it's 200. And then at the council before I left, I said at the council on foreign relations, do not take out Bashar Assad.
[2:57:17.980 --> 2:57:25.980]  One of the reasons I went in and sacrificed my life was because the president or Dr. Bashar Assad does protect millions of Christians.
[2:57:25.980 --> 2:57:30.980]  Stay right there. Let's come back and talk about that. And this Christians Today attack that blew up. But you're absolutely right.
[2:57:30.980 --> 2:57:39.980]  Christians, even the UN admits, are the majority of persecuting groups. How do we get America to start defending Christians? That is so critical in the future of the whole planet, not just America.
[2:57:39.980 --> 2:58:01.980]  Hour number four is two minutes away.
[2:58:10.980 --> 2:58:18.980]  I've lost almost 40 pounds in less than four months. It's incredible. So do yourself a favor. Try out the products if you've been on the fence.
[2:58:18.980 --> 2:58:28.980]  You can't lose, except if you don't take action. Because when you buy the products, you're funding the operation that is always delivering thanks to your support and God's grace in our action.
[2:58:28.980 --> 2:58:36.980]  But you need these products. That's the real reason you want to get them is because they're amazing. And then when you get great results, please tell others about it word of mouth.
[2:58:36.980 --> 2:58:47.980]  That's how we expand in the face of the NWO instead of imploding. We're fighting to win and we are winning. Thanks to you.
[2:58:47.980 --> 2:58:55.980]  The globalists think America is done. The globalists think the West is done. They think that Christians are done and finished. They believe they've broken our backs.
[2:58:55.980 --> 2:59:08.980]  They believe that with big tech censorship, we'll just crawl into ditches and submit to them. And they believe that if they can demonize and shut down info wars that they rightfully see as a symbol of beacon of populism and freedom,
[2:59:08.980 --> 2:59:15.980]  not just to America, but to the whole world, that they can demoralize everybody else and win. While they can shut info wars down, they can intimidate everybody else.
[2:59:15.980 --> 2:59:26.980]  That's why it's beyond critical that you keep info wars on the air. It's only by your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support that we're on air. And I want to thank you all this Christmas for your past support.
[2:59:26.980 --> 2:59:34.980]  But I want to encourage you now to redouble your efforts and financially support us by getting great products you need during the 12 days of Christmas and infowarstore.com.
[2:59:34.980 --> 2:59:46.980]  Massive sales, storewide free shipping, double patria points, infowarstore.com. Please take action now. George Soros hopes you don't.
[2:59:46.980 --> 2:59:58.980]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones.
[2:59:58.980 --> 3:00:09.980]  We're doing a few more segments in the Charles Salente, always informative. It's going to be taken over. We're going to go to Jack, Gene, Joe and Derek and Alex, David, Carlos and many others here in a moment.
[3:00:09.980 --> 3:00:22.980]  But getting back to the fact that it was missionaries and Christian groups in East Germany and the Soviet Union that helped bring that down, you're talking about the Christians, the majority of those being persecuted.
[3:00:22.980 --> 3:00:29.980]  Hollywood admits they're pissed at the Russians because they're becoming really Christian again and really promoting things that will have them be a good stable country.
[3:00:29.980 --> 3:00:38.980]  Why would the elites, so many of them, want to destroy fundamental Christian ethos that's made this country so successful? Why?
[3:00:38.980 --> 3:00:49.980]  First of all, they don't understand Christianity. Secondly, let me put a lot of the blame on many of the ministers whom I've talked to, including and I will be very frank.
[3:00:49.980 --> 3:01:00.980]  I've talked to fundamentalists and I won't name who they are across from Baptist to CMA, Christian missionary alliances to different leaders within the Christian community.
[3:01:00.980 --> 3:01:12.980]  And what I hear is, oh, well, you know, we just talk about our summons. And so I don't have a focal point for which I have been trying to proselytize the safe for 20 years.
[3:01:12.980 --> 3:01:22.980]  It's Christianity that is being slaughtered all over the world, Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan. You want to send a missionary to Pakistan? Good luck.
[3:01:22.980 --> 3:01:28.980]  You want to send missionaries to different parts of Asia and China? Good luck.
[3:01:28.980 --> 3:01:36.980]  And what I'm trying to say, and I'm trying to convene all of these missionaries and these leaders of different groups into one group, but they don't want to do it.
[3:01:36.980 --> 3:01:44.980]  So part of it is our own problem within Christianity. Even as a Jew, I can say, look, I have the spirit of the Christianity.
[3:01:44.980 --> 3:01:58.980]  I understand what it takes to do this type of solidification within America to make it an export. China prosecutes Christians.
[3:01:58.980 --> 3:02:12.980]  Africa prosecutes Christians. The Muslim countries prosecute. Go to Saudi Arabia to the great Mohammed bin Salman, who just did an IPO for two trillion, and ask the great Mohammed bin Salman, the prince.
[3:02:12.980 --> 3:02:27.980]  You know what? I want to set up a church near Mecca and Medina. Let's hear what he has to say. You can go to Iran and I can tell you that the Christians are treated well, not incredibly well, but the Persians have no problems with the Christian.
[3:02:27.980 --> 3:02:39.980]  Go to Saudi Arabia. Go somewhat to Jordan and see what happens. Israel has to protect Christian sites because it's Israeli boys who protect it and go to Israel to see the beginnings of Christianity.
[3:02:39.980 --> 3:02:45.980]  But I have to lay full with the different leaders with the different sects of Christianity here.
[3:02:45.980 --> 3:02:57.980]  They're ashamed of the faith. They bought in the whole ecumenical thing and they don't get that Texas was founded by Christians that were sent in a decade before by the president at the time.
[3:02:57.980 --> 3:03:10.980]  And it's always been Christians expanding the West and building real civilizations at work. And all these other groups know it and go exterminate these people because the leadership of the West may figure out how powerful this is and how this works.
[3:03:10.980 --> 3:03:20.980]  It's incredible that the biggest weapon we have in the arsenal of liberty is Christianity and we've allowed it to be liberalized and turned into a leftist farce and destroyed.
[3:03:20.980 --> 3:03:23.980]  And these preachers aren't using any of the real power God gave them.
[3:03:23.980 --> 3:03:33.980]  Well, let me put it this way. So let's be fair. Number one, we have a problem. I've had a problem with the Catholicism. Not that I'm anti-Catholic.
[3:03:33.980 --> 3:03:47.980]  On the contrary, my aunt was a Catholic and I used to go to a church in Albion to lose. But I have a real problem because Pope Francis had been involved with the Hunte in Argentina in the 1970s.
[3:03:47.980 --> 3:04:00.980]  And I had asked Vance to go down and either arrest him or deal with him as a terrorist because he worked with the Hunte in Argentina and allowed and supported the death of three to four of our nuns.
[3:04:00.980 --> 3:04:04.980]  Two of our American nuns and two of our American Jesuit priests.
[3:04:04.980 --> 3:04:14.980]  From that point on, the church was already stigmatized, Catholic church, including all the pedophilia, which has never been addressed.
[3:04:14.980 --> 3:04:20.980]  So nobody was held accountable. None of the archbishops were held accountable. Some of them are going right now.
[3:04:20.980 --> 3:04:27.980]  But Pope Francis was one of the biggest criminals of all. I said he was a terrorist and they didn't want to accept it.
[3:04:27.980 --> 3:04:37.980]  But the fundamentalist Christians can't get along with each other. There has to be an ecumenical council wherein in America they get together and understand it.
[3:04:37.980 --> 3:04:50.980]  One of the most powerful tools I had in the Soviet Union was not my ability to manipulate. It was my ability to insert Christianity through Pope John and the Greek Orthodox Church in the Russian.
[3:04:50.980 --> 3:04:52.980]  Stay there. Back in 60 seconds.
[3:04:52.980 --> 3:04:57.980]  Owl killer in New Jersey. You're on the air. Go ahead.
[3:04:57.980 --> 3:05:03.980]  Alex, hey, I just want to say it's great to be back once again, and I've never gotten to do this, but I'm going to give you a shout out for your product.
[3:05:03.980 --> 3:05:08.980]  So that's super blue fluoride free toothpaste and that super blue whitening toothpaste is on another level.
[3:05:08.980 --> 3:05:13.980]  I use the one I use the super blue in the morning and then the whitening at night and it absorbs into your gum.
[3:05:13.980 --> 3:05:19.980]  It is by far the best product that I've ever used in my life. I literally just took a turbo course on my way to the gym right now.
[3:05:19.980 --> 3:05:28.980]  I've had four shoulder surgeries and a back surgery and that body has made me feel better than any type of physical therapy or anything that I've ever done in my life.
[3:05:28.980 --> 3:05:35.980]  So I just want to get that out of the way. Support this man. Everything that he exposed. Nobody knew about Bohemian Grove. Nobody knew about FD. Nobody knew about Bilderberg.
[3:05:35.980 --> 3:05:40.980]  Nobody called 9-11 before it happened in July 2001. Go look it up yourself.
[3:05:40.980 --> 3:05:50.980]  Well, we try our best, sir. They definitely want to stop the year without you or not here, but yeah, these are all great products. So thank you, sir.
[3:06:10.980 --> 3:06:19.980]  But because of those who look on and do nothing, if you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[3:06:19.980 --> 3:06:25.980]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center. It's Alex Jones.
[3:06:25.980 --> 3:06:31.980]  And who's in command? The American people and their will to not be slaves. We're just a focal point of all that.
[3:06:31.980 --> 3:06:36.980]  Our Steve Pachinic is our guest. That is new book out. Find out more details at StevePachinic.com.
[3:06:36.980 --> 3:06:41.980]  He'll come back during the new year. Let's run through a bunch of calls here. Here's one. He's a psychiatrist.
[3:06:41.980 --> 3:06:47.980]  We can't diagnose him in a far here. Violate the... Violate what is it? The Goldwater rule.
[3:06:47.980 --> 3:06:51.980]  But Jack in Wisconsin, you've got a question for Dr. Pachinic. Go ahead.
[3:06:51.980 --> 3:06:54.980]  Hey, Jack.
[3:06:54.980 --> 3:07:05.980]  Hi, Dr. P. I got two questions for you. The first one is, last time you were on with Owen, you wanted this great talk about how
[3:07:05.980 --> 3:07:10.980]  the majority of U.S. presidents were under one form of mind control or another.
[3:07:10.980 --> 3:07:17.980]  Do you believe President Trump is under any form of mind control? And if so, what type?
[3:07:17.980 --> 3:07:22.980]  No, no, no. What I said basically is that the presidents had different illnesses.
[3:07:22.980 --> 3:07:31.980]  John F. Kennedy had asthma disease. A few of the others, Reagan had dementia, which was earlier than anybody thought.
[3:07:31.980 --> 3:07:41.980]  Trump is, quite frankly, quite healthy. And as a physician, I'm amazed that he can eat what he does, and ostensibly doesn't even exercise.
[3:07:41.980 --> 3:07:44.980]  He does have incredible genetics, and the family's known for those.
[3:07:44.980 --> 3:07:51.980]  Yeah, I understand. I mean, it's a German loading. And also, what people don't understand, and he doesn't say much about it,
[3:07:51.980 --> 3:08:00.980]  his uncle was a famous MIT professor, and he never talks about him. And I'm just amazed. He's quite modest about his family.
[3:08:00.980 --> 3:08:02.980]  So the answer is no.
[3:08:02.980 --> 3:08:10.980]  What about the effects? I mean, I know that Roy Cohn was a bad guy and had some problems, but the whole House Un-American Activities Committee,
[3:08:10.980 --> 3:08:15.980]  the whole situation with McCarthy who had turned out was right in many ways.
[3:08:15.980 --> 3:08:22.980]  I mean, Trump sat around in the middle of that as a young adult and really the John Burt's society and all that,
[3:08:22.980 --> 3:08:27.980]  and really got a conspiratorial view, which is how things work. I think that really shaped Trump as well.
[3:08:27.980 --> 3:08:34.980]  Well, I think many things did. One of the things that, as a New Yorker, I understood about Trump, and I didn't know him personally,
[3:08:34.980 --> 3:08:44.980]  but we were very impressed, and I said it a long time ago, when a man builds a skating rink for the city of New York for young kids
[3:08:44.980 --> 3:08:50.980]  because Koch couldn't do it in eight years and doesn't charge anything, that tells you a lot about his character.
[3:08:50.980 --> 3:08:58.980]  I don't care what he says. I don't care about his tweets. What I care about, what the American public has to understand,
[3:08:58.980 --> 3:09:09.980]  Democrats, Republicans are independent. You have to look at the outcome of what he's done, the derail, the casinos, the condominiums.
[3:09:09.980 --> 3:09:19.980]  You do not create assets which are viable and make a living, and you cannot be ineffectual. It just doesn't happen.
[3:09:19.980 --> 3:09:27.980]  Mike Bloomberg has the same attitude. He created an asset which was very valuable. Maybe he's worth more or less than Trump.
[3:09:27.980 --> 3:09:35.980]  I don't particularly care, but among all of the candidates in the Democratic Party, you will have another businessman there.
[3:09:35.980 --> 3:09:41.980]  You're saying you want new blood and things. We've got to jump to a good point. Let's go ahead and talk to...
[3:09:41.980 --> 3:09:49.980]  Let's go ahead and take a call from Joe in Texas. Joe, go ahead.
[3:09:49.980 --> 3:09:54.980]  Hi, Alex. Nice to talk to you. I want to say Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to you and Dr. McKinnon.
[3:09:54.980 --> 3:09:55.980]  You too.
[3:09:55.980 --> 3:10:02.980]  I didn't know a lot about politics before 2016. When Hillary said you was dark heart, that legitimized you and everything.
[3:10:02.980 --> 3:10:05.980]  What you were talking about, I knew you...
[3:10:05.980 --> 3:10:08.980]  I did love it when Hillary called me dark heart. That's a good nickname.
[3:10:08.980 --> 3:10:16.980]  That had me... I was like, okay, that's the truth. She's the evil woman who ever walked this planet with the rest of the Democrats.
[3:10:16.980 --> 3:10:24.980]  That's why I call her all pack-of-line demons. I want to know what Dr. McKinnon thought about you.
[3:10:24.980 --> 3:10:33.980]  I like Dr. McKinnon. He got more experience in life than what I ever have, but I just want to ask him about...
[3:10:33.980 --> 3:10:39.980]  I know you say she's right about something about Israel, but...
[3:10:39.980 --> 3:10:42.980]  Absolutely. Thank you, Joe. Great question. Sorry, I got to move quick.
[3:10:42.980 --> 3:10:47.980]  The whole Q thing... I don't want to poo-poo folks that like that and everything.
[3:10:47.980 --> 3:10:54.980]  We'll talk about things that are confirmed and real. People are like, oh, well, then if it's like something on 4chan, it must be...
[3:10:54.980 --> 3:10:56.980]  What's your view on that, Doc?
[3:10:56.980 --> 3:11:03.980]  Well, you know, again, ironically, I don't have a conspiratorial mind. I mean, I believe in what I know and what I fact.
[3:11:03.980 --> 3:11:07.980]  When I went on your show, it was simple. You understood what 9-11 was about.
[3:11:07.980 --> 3:11:11.980]  From that day on, we'd never really deviate. We may have some differences.
[3:11:11.980 --> 3:11:14.980]  I don't know what Q is. I have an idea of what it is.
[3:11:14.980 --> 3:11:21.980]  But again, you have to understand, in the world of intelligence, forget the CIA, we play everything.
[3:11:21.980 --> 3:11:28.980]  We play it as dialectics, meaning we take one side and then we take the other and we play it together at the same time.
[3:11:28.980 --> 3:11:38.980]  So you don't know whether Q is a product of any one of the 16 or 17 intelligence app organizations or whatever it is that we do in games.
[3:11:38.980 --> 3:11:45.980]  Because it's anonymous. It's perfect for cutouts and countergroups and it just becomes like jumping into black water.
[3:11:45.980 --> 3:11:46.980]  You don't know what's in there.
[3:11:46.980 --> 3:11:50.980]  That's exactly right. And that's a good analogy.
[3:11:50.980 --> 3:11:56.980]  Joe, it's like 35,000-foot view, crystal clear, mountaintop air. We're very straight up about everything.
[3:11:56.980 --> 3:12:05.980]  Well, if a war has been around a long time and it's very rare when you have a man like Alex Jones who can predict four months or six months before 9-11,
[3:12:05.980 --> 3:12:11.980]  that we were going to have 9-11. And when I heard that, I said, God bless this individual. I'm going to get to know him.
[3:12:11.980 --> 3:12:15.980]  And that was it. It's as simple as that. It's not that complicated.
[3:12:15.980 --> 3:12:20.980]  It wasn't that complicated. They were priming us for it. And when the big buildings blow up, we take your rights.
[3:12:20.980 --> 3:12:22.980]  It was all just, they had it all lined up. You can see it.
[3:12:22.980 --> 3:12:25.980]  All right. Thank you so much, caller. I can't get to all these.
[3:12:25.980 --> 3:12:30.980]  That's why I suddenly take six calls. You're all great. But Jenny's got to go. We got another guest coming up.
[3:12:30.980 --> 3:12:35.980]  Let's go ahead and talk to Steve in Texas.
[3:12:35.980 --> 3:12:38.980]  Has a question. Go ahead, Steve.
[3:12:38.980 --> 3:12:43.980]  Hey, Mr. Jones. Good to see you. I can serve you an awesome lesson. We're out there with Stevie Ray Vaughn.
[3:12:43.980 --> 3:12:48.980]  We love you too, brother. I see your question. Should we take on some dim strategies? I mean, specify that.
[3:12:48.980 --> 3:12:55.980]  Yeah. So let me elaborate on that. So I see that the Democrats have obviously made a push towards the persuade our black Americans,
[3:12:55.980 --> 3:12:58.980]  Latino Americans, or Asian Americans, that they are the party for them.
[3:12:58.980 --> 3:13:02.980]  And I don't hear enough Republicans, conservatives, libertarians talking about how,
[3:13:02.980 --> 3:13:08.980]  especially with the demographic change, this is going to be a serious win for us if we tell them about the freedoms, the liberties that we're all offering.
[3:13:08.980 --> 3:13:13.980]  And I wonder if you want to talk. Well, I mean, I try to do that. But I mean, the media, I don't have to make things racially based.
[3:13:13.980 --> 3:13:16.980]  I'm like Martin Luther King and then I, junior, that I think just be the ideas.
[3:13:16.980 --> 3:13:20.980]  And, you know, I'm going to say, Hey, it's for a black person. It's good for you too.
[3:13:20.980 --> 3:13:24.980]  You know, the left, that's really what's racist to me is making everything about what color you are.
[3:13:24.980 --> 3:13:29.980]  But, but, but I mean, obviously the Democratic Party want domesticated enslaved people that they can control and dumb down.
[3:13:29.980 --> 3:13:35.980]  And I think we should talk more about that. A great question, Steve. Dr. Pachennick, can you comment on that?
[3:13:35.980 --> 3:13:41.980]  Sure, I happen to be Hispanic when you're born in Cuba and you grow up and you speak Spanish and that's your native language.
[3:13:41.980 --> 3:13:49.980]  That's Hispanic. So I assume, like many others, that America will be, it's good for everyone.
[3:13:49.980 --> 3:13:57.980]  And contrary to the Democrats or anybody else who tries to fractionalize us or put us into categories, it doesn't work.
[3:13:57.980 --> 3:14:02.980]  What works is the opportunity to make mistakes here, not just success, but mistakes.
[3:14:02.980 --> 3:14:08.980]  There's no other country where I can make mistakes and as many as I have and come back and be successful,
[3:14:08.980 --> 3:14:12.980]  whether you're black, Hispanic, Asian, Hindu, it doesn't really matter.
[3:14:12.980 --> 3:14:15.980]  That's really our power is it is the experiment. It is the Wild Wild West.
[3:14:15.980 --> 3:14:19.980]  And let's admit we're the crazy, diverse pirates. We've always been and embrace it.
[3:14:19.980 --> 3:14:24.980]  And that's basically, I agree. I don't think we have to be all that sane and we don't have to be all that.
[3:14:24.980 --> 3:14:28.980]  I mean, of course we're violent. Of course we're crazy. Everybody wants to come here. That's who we are.
[3:14:28.980 --> 3:14:33.980]  Let's embrace it. We're maniacs. Well, I would agree with that. I would agree.
[3:14:33.980 --> 3:14:37.980]  We're rational maniacs who basically don't mess with us.
[3:14:37.980 --> 3:14:43.980]  We're going to come in and if you think we're weak or something is happening like China does, think again,
[3:14:43.980 --> 3:14:47.980]  because the Japanese made that mistake, the Germans made that mistake.
[3:14:47.980 --> 3:14:54.980]  Many countries make a mistake that because we're compliant, we're nice, that we cannot be ruthless.
[3:14:54.980 --> 3:14:58.980]  I will get, I will refer you back to the Civil War by Abraham Lincoln.
[3:14:58.980 --> 3:15:02.980]  It was not civil and it was an auto genocide.
[3:15:02.980 --> 3:15:09.980]  And the South was beaten for reasons that had nothing to do with slavery, but had to do with commerce, business.
[3:15:09.980 --> 3:15:14.980]  That's right. It was about, it was about the urban controlling the world, just like is happening again.
[3:15:14.980 --> 3:15:19.980]  We really appreciate your coming back in the new year. Have a great Christmas. God bless you, Dr. Pachennick.
[3:15:19.980 --> 3:15:25.980]  God bless and happy new year. All right, thank you. StevePachennick.com. Okay, I'm sorry to David, Alex, Derek, Gene and Carlos.

[3:20:29.980 --> 3:20:44.980]  Thank you for having me on. The Alex Jones show today. And what are we here? Two days before Christmas. I want to wish everybody a Merry Christmas bon natale and also a time to celebrate.
[3:20:44.980 --> 3:20:55.980]  Celebrate the birth of the Prince of Peace. And as founder of Occupy Peace, the Prince of Peace is my kind of guy.
[3:20:55.980 --> 3:21:04.980]  Peace on earth with will to men. And do we need peace on earth?
[3:21:04.980 --> 3:21:24.980]  Murder, violence, corruption, misery, poverty, wars, protests, riots, strikes.
[3:21:24.980 --> 3:21:30.980]  This is for 40 years. 2020 will be my 40th year. Take a look around the world.
[3:21:30.980 --> 3:21:49.980]  Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, Syria, Yemen, Libya, Algeria, Sudan, Mali, Niger, Guinea, Cameroon, South Africa.
[3:21:49.980 --> 3:22:03.980]  Let's see. Oh, Zimbabwe. Oh, forgot about Hong Kong. Yeah. Oh, Chile, Columbia, Peru, Bolivia, Venezuela.
[3:22:03.980 --> 3:22:17.980]  Look what's going on around the world. War, demonstrations, protests.
[3:22:17.980 --> 3:22:21.980]  I've never seen again anything like this.
[3:22:21.980 --> 3:22:32.980]  I will not die in murderous wars started by murderous leaders of murderous political gangs.
[3:22:32.980 --> 3:22:42.980]  Will you or your children? As the founder of Occupy Peace, I'm a warrior for the Prince of Peace.
[3:22:42.980 --> 3:22:48.980]  It's Christmas time. Celebrating the birth of the Prince of Peace.
[3:22:48.980 --> 3:23:04.980]  As I said, my kind of guy. Let's give peace a chance. Please consider giving a Christmas gift of peace to Occupy Peace.
[3:23:04.980 --> 3:23:13.980]  Because, united in peace, we will defeat evil.
[3:23:13.980 --> 3:23:20.980]  So, my trip is to Occupy Peace. Is it yours? If so, please join me.
[3:23:20.980 --> 3:23:28.980]  I was just thinking, where are all the religions right now? I don't care whatever one you believe in.
[3:23:28.980 --> 3:23:36.980]  We're all the leaders of those religions saying, we need peace on earth.
[3:23:36.980 --> 3:23:43.980]  We are not going to evolve to a higher level if we live in fear and terror.
[3:23:43.980 --> 3:23:52.980]  And I don't want, you got, I don't, these people that say, well, you know, we need another war.
[3:23:52.980 --> 3:24:02.980]  We could do this and we could save it. Don't want to hear it. Just for the record, America hasn't won a war since World War II.
[3:24:02.980 --> 3:24:17.980]  And they won World War II with the help of the Russians, now that we've learned to hate so much because of the Democrats putting out all that propaganda as to why Hillary Clinton lost against Donald Trump.
[3:24:17.980 --> 3:24:31.980]  Well, clearly she lost because people couldn't stand her. And when you look at her unpopularity rating prior to the election in 2016, it couldn't have been clearer.
[3:24:31.980 --> 3:24:36.980]  But yet, they've taught us how to hate the Russians.
[3:24:36.980 --> 3:24:43.980]  And now Trump just signed the biggest military bill in our history.
[3:24:43.980 --> 3:24:52.980]  And only 48 people in the House of Representatives voted against it.
[3:24:52.980 --> 3:25:00.980]  48 people. Those liberal Democrats, huh? Yeah, forget about it.
[3:25:00.980 --> 3:25:06.980]  I don't want my money going to war. I want it going to peace.
[3:25:06.980 --> 3:25:22.980]  And this whole thing about the impeachment, Trump was holding back $400 million in military aid for the Ukrainians so they could keep the war going against the Russians.
[3:25:22.980 --> 3:25:30.980]  I don't want my money going there. I work very hard and so does everybody listening to make a buck.
[3:25:30.980 --> 3:25:36.980]  I want them stealing my money to give it to the military industrial complex.
[3:25:36.980 --> 3:25:38.980]  And the facts are there.
[3:25:38.980 --> 3:25:45.980]  Defense stocks could soar again in 2020 after massive defense spending.
[3:25:45.980 --> 3:25:54.980]  Oh, you know where this is coming from? CNBC, not the world's socialist website.
[3:25:54.980 --> 3:26:04.980]  A real political uncertainty coupled with a colossal uptick in U.S. military spending can make defense stocks a winning trade once again in 2020.
[3:26:04.980 --> 3:26:10.980]  Under the Trump administration, the space has left the broader stock market in the dust.
[3:26:10.980 --> 3:26:27.980]  The iShares, U.S. aerospace and defense exchange traded funds, ITA has rallied more than 70% since Trump won the election back in 2016.
[3:26:27.980 --> 3:26:34.980]  The S&P 500, meanwhile, is up 50% from that time.
[3:26:34.980 --> 3:26:48.980]  This year has been no different. The ITA ETFs have surged more than 30% in 2019 while the S&P 500 has gained 27%.
[3:26:48.980 --> 3:26:55.980]  Also, a historic boost to U.S. defense budget should be a boom for the defense stocks in 2020.
[3:26:55.980 --> 3:26:58.980]  The article goes on and on and on.
[3:26:58.980 --> 3:27:11.980]  So this is where your money's going, not going to build an hour rod in infrastructure, not going to create jobs, going to the military industrial complex, not my trip.
[3:27:11.980 --> 3:27:17.980]  And again, anybody that wants to go to war, any leader out there, lead the charge.
[3:27:17.980 --> 3:27:28.980]  That's right. Get dressed up in your uniform and lead the charge and send your kids, send your wife and send your money, ain't my trip.
[3:27:28.980 --> 3:27:42.980]  I am an American. I am a believer of the real men who brought us liberty, love and freedom like the founding fathers.
[3:27:42.980 --> 3:27:47.980]  And you go back to George Washington. Hey, Christmas Eve is tomorrow.
[3:27:47.980 --> 3:27:54.980]  I guess that Washington wasn't spending Christmas Eve under the Christmas tree with gifts for his family.
[3:27:54.980 --> 3:28:00.980]  No, Washington was crossing the Delaware to fight for freedom.
[3:28:00.980 --> 3:28:10.980]  And what's his farewell address? No foreign entanglements. Got it?
[3:28:10.980 --> 3:28:15.980]  Look what just came out with the Afghanistan papers.
[3:28:15.980 --> 3:28:22.980]  Totally, totally shut down by the mainstream media.
[3:28:22.980 --> 3:28:25.980]  Don't even see it.
[3:28:25.980 --> 3:28:28.980]  They were out near gone.
[3:28:28.980 --> 3:28:31.980]  How they lied to us.
[3:28:31.980 --> 3:28:38.980]  How they lied to us about what was going on in Afghanistan.
[3:28:38.980 --> 3:28:42.980]  It's a time for truth. It's Christmas time.
[3:28:42.980 --> 3:29:08.980]  The Prince of Peace, my kind of guy. We're back in just a few.
[3:29:08.980 --> 3:29:13.980]  We're back in just a few minutes.
[3:29:38.980 --> 3:29:57.980]  I'm here to give the listeners and viewers a project report in the next 60 seconds.
[3:29:57.980 --> 3:29:59.980]  And here's the bottom line.
[3:29:59.980 --> 3:30:09.980]  I'm not playing around. I'm not screwing around. I'm not joking and neither are you.
[3:30:09.980 --> 3:30:20.980]  Info wars and this operation we built together has delivered for America has delivered for our children and the unborn has delivered in the face of toxic fluoride and the GMOs and the deadly vaccine depopulation operation.
[3:30:20.980 --> 3:30:29.980]  We're doing is beyond critical and you hear the key word what we are doing is beyond critical.
[3:30:29.980 --> 3:30:37.980]  So this is the time with the biggest sales ever during Christmas at info wars tour.com to get in there and buy these products.
[3:30:37.980 --> 3:30:43.980]  You already need that I need the funding for to get this operation to the next level.
[3:30:43.980 --> 3:30:47.980]  I need the money. I need to be able to fight the globalist.
[3:30:47.980 --> 3:30:52.980]  I need you. You need these products. Get them at info wars tour.com.
[3:30:52.980 --> 3:30:59.980]  So what's the most important part? Let's say in a bulldozer running over the globalist, the treads, the wheels, the engine, the scoop on the front.
[3:30:59.980 --> 3:31:04.980]  It's all very important, but the fuel is paramount and that's my allegor.
[3:31:04.980 --> 3:31:15.980]  Turbo force is vitamins, minerals, amino acids that synergistically work with six different natural forms of healthy clean energy that last for 10 hours in the average metabolic system metabolism of a human.
[3:31:15.980 --> 3:31:19.980]  Some people get 15 hours out of it. Some people get about eight hours, but people take this people taking sports.
[3:31:19.980 --> 3:31:23.980]  People cannot believe it's the best they've ever had because it's not high.
[3:31:23.980 --> 3:31:29.980]  Nobody puts as much product into their pre workouts, their post workouts. You can call us whatever you want.
[3:31:29.980 --> 3:31:34.980]  It's it's a it's a total solution all around the best you're going to find turbo force without you.
[3:31:34.980 --> 3:31:37.980]  We don't roll with you. We search forward together.
[3:31:37.980 --> 3:31:39.980]  It's like the bulldozer without the diesel fuel.
[3:31:39.980 --> 3:31:42.980]  If we don't have your financial support, we will be defeated.
[3:31:42.980 --> 3:31:45.980]  The support is a good product. You already need that literally fuel your body, your mind.
[3:31:45.980 --> 3:31:52.980]  It's a win win three 60 together in full or store.com or triple a two five three three one three nine.
[3:31:52.980 --> 3:32:00.980]  It's your last chance to get the original designer limited edition Jeffrey Epstein Christmas sweater.
[3:32:00.980 --> 3:32:11.980]  The globalists are so scared of this story continuing to come out for people learning about the deep state and the international blackmail rings using kidnap women and children to compromise.
[3:32:11.980 --> 3:32:16.980]  World leaders, they do not want this story continuing.
[3:32:16.980 --> 3:32:26.980]  And this is your last chance to get the limited edition Christmas sweater at info or store.com to help spread the word to have a piece of history and to fund our operation.
[3:32:26.980 --> 3:32:32.980]  So again, it says Christmas lights are a lot like Epstein that these things don't hang themselves on the front.
[3:32:32.980 --> 3:32:42.980]  On the back, it's got info wars.com and shows the O and info wars as a wreath. It's also a news. The system can't stand it when you promote things to grassroots level.
[3:32:42.980 --> 3:32:46.980]  They can't stand it when you fund independent pro America pro human media.
[3:32:46.980 --> 3:32:50.980]  That's why you've got to take advantage of this shirt and get it today.
[3:32:50.980 --> 3:33:11.980]  Then for store.com you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:33:11.980 --> 3:33:22.980]  Waging war on corruption. It's Gerald Salente. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:33:22.980 --> 3:33:42.980]  Hello. Hello. Claus, the tiny Alex Jones show to be with you.

[3:34:36.700 --> 3:34:41.700]  And remember, do what you can to support Infowars.
[3:34:41.700 --> 3:34:51.500]  Get Freedom Ring, and one of our top trends for 2019 was censorship 2019.
[3:34:51.500 --> 3:34:56.580]  And boy do we have it, and it's only going to get worse.
[3:34:56.580 --> 3:35:03.380]  I was talking before about the Afghan War, the longest war in American history, and how
[3:35:03.380 --> 3:35:07.620]  they've lied to us about this war.
[3:35:07.620 --> 3:35:12.740]  The facts are there in the Pentagon, or excuse me, the Pentagon Papers, yeah, the other Pentagon
[3:35:12.740 --> 3:35:22.620]  Papers, the Afghanistan Papers, they just had an election in Afghanistan.
[3:35:22.620 --> 3:35:24.860]  You know when the election was over?
[3:35:24.860 --> 3:35:36.500]  Well, let's see, September, that's right, September, you know when they finished counting
[3:35:36.500 --> 3:35:46.660]  the votes a couple of days ago, Afghanistan struggles to declare a winner in disputed
[3:35:46.660 --> 3:35:50.820]  September vote.
[3:35:50.820 --> 3:35:57.460]  So the guy who's been running the show for five years, he's back.
[3:35:57.460 --> 3:36:00.340]  They had a very, very low turnout.
[3:36:00.340 --> 3:36:07.620]  The turnout was a historic low, as about a third of the country's polling centers did
[3:36:07.620 --> 3:36:11.060]  not open.
[3:36:11.060 --> 3:36:23.300]  A country of 35 million people, first they said 2.2 million people voted, and then without
[3:36:23.300 --> 3:36:34.180]  giving it another reason why, they said, well, only 1.8 million voted, 1.8 million.
[3:36:34.180 --> 3:36:43.940]  That's like almost as bad as the stupid Democrat debates that they had last week, 8.2 million
[3:36:43.940 --> 3:37:00.220]  people, 8.2 million people from a voting age in this country of 275 million people.
[3:37:00.220 --> 3:37:03.780]  So our elections are as worthless as this.
[3:37:03.780 --> 3:37:10.500]  And again, what this, I mentioned about the military industrial complex, and all this
[3:37:10.500 --> 3:37:17.140]  moronic talk about impeachment, what was it about, Trump holding back 400 million bucks
[3:37:17.140 --> 3:37:23.220]  of our money so he could find out the dirt on Biden's son and how the boy got that money
[3:37:23.220 --> 3:37:31.580]  along with John Kerry's stepson-in-law's partner for barisma energy, and they know nothing
[3:37:31.580 --> 3:37:37.100]  about energy, never been to Ukraine and don't speak the lingo.
[3:37:37.100 --> 3:37:45.420]  So what I'm saying here is the people have no clue what's going on, they're lying about
[3:37:45.420 --> 3:37:53.660]  this war, and they're wasting our money while we need to rebuild America.
[3:37:53.660 --> 3:38:00.340]  So do what you can to support info wars so we could give peace of chance and of course
[3:38:00.340 --> 3:38:01.740]  occupy peace.
[3:38:01.740 --> 3:38:08.780]  I just want to stay on this Afghan papers, Afghanistan papers, U.S. denies public was
[3:38:08.780 --> 3:38:21.660]  lied about Afghanistan, and this is from the defense secretary Mark Esper.
[3:38:21.660 --> 3:38:29.820]  Between all the folks looking at this conflict over the years, some type of insinuation that
[3:38:29.820 --> 3:38:34.820]  there's been large scale conspiracy is just to me ridiculous.
[3:38:34.820 --> 3:38:44.500]  Hey, Junior, maybe to you it's ridiculous, not to me, I know how to read, and I read
[3:38:44.500 --> 3:38:57.300]  what they said in that 400 pages of generals, of colonels, of sergeants, and many, many
[3:38:57.300 --> 3:39:01.420]  other people saying how they lie to us.
[3:39:01.420 --> 3:39:07.620]  So maybe ridiculous to you, but keep it to yourself, Junior.
[3:39:07.620 --> 3:39:14.340]  Don't try to shove it on me, boy.
[3:39:14.340 --> 3:39:21.980]  I know there's an assertion out there of some sort of coordinated lie over the course of
[3:39:21.980 --> 3:39:36.380]  18 years, I find that a mischaracterization, and that's according to General Mark Millery.
[3:39:36.380 --> 3:39:47.020]  Hey, General, say to Jack, hey, you can't win a war, you guys haven't won the war, killed
[3:39:47.020 --> 3:39:52.820]  over a couple of hundred thousand, and then maybe destroyed the country, cost us trillions
[3:39:52.820 --> 3:40:01.220]  of dollars, and how many U.S. soldiers are dead because of this, General, got it?
[3:40:01.220 --> 3:40:11.620]  Not a mischaracterization, you are the character that's missing it, man.
[3:40:11.620 --> 3:40:17.700]  What else do we have here? And those were honest assessments that they were never intended
[3:40:17.700 --> 3:40:21.380]  to deceive either the Congress or the American people.
[3:40:21.380 --> 3:40:29.100]  They're lies, man, they're lies, and you guys are liars, covering up the losing war, that
[3:40:29.100 --> 3:40:32.500]  you can't win going on 19 years.
[3:40:32.500 --> 3:40:36.340]  Hey, General, could you count that high?
[3:40:36.340 --> 3:40:43.540]  I am an American, I am not a traitor like all you people that are traitors against
[3:40:43.540 --> 3:40:53.180]  General Washington, the first president of the United States, a real fighting man who
[3:40:53.180 --> 3:40:57.780]  warned us of no fine entanglements.
[3:40:57.780 --> 3:41:00.380]  Let's see over here, what else do we have?
[3:41:00.380 --> 3:41:07.940]  The U.S. newspaper, the post, said the documents which are called the Afghanistan Papers, contradicted,
[3:41:07.940 --> 3:41:14.580]  quote, a chorus of public statements from U.S. presidents, military commanders, and
[3:41:14.580 --> 3:41:22.900]  dip low mats, and that's what they are, man, they dip real low on that mat, bend over,
[3:41:22.900 --> 3:41:27.940]  and you know what else, those are our dip low mats.
[3:41:27.940 --> 3:41:35.460]  Well, dip low mats, who assured Americans year after year that they were making progress
[3:41:35.460 --> 3:41:45.700]  in Afghanistan and the war was worth fighting.
[3:41:45.700 --> 3:41:58.860]  And you know what this General Millery said, that these documents were backwards looking,
[3:41:58.860 --> 3:42:06.260]  and that U.S. troops have been successful in rooting out Al Qaeda and punishing their
[3:42:06.260 --> 3:42:12.420]  protectors, the Taliban, hey, the Taliban were not their protectors, I wrote about this
[3:42:12.420 --> 3:42:17.900]  as it was happening in our trends journal.
[3:42:17.900 --> 3:42:23.100]  They asked for proof that Osama bin Laden had anything to do with this, Bush wouldn't
[3:42:23.100 --> 3:42:32.980]  give it to them, hey, it got bin Laden, how come the war's still going on?
[3:42:32.980 --> 3:42:41.260]  It's a losing war, losing money, immoral, it's Christmas time, time to celebrate the

[3:44:08.740 --> 3:44:13.860]  We're in a fight between Satan and Christ and it's being played out amongst us mortals
[3:44:14.180 --> 3:44:18.900]  But it's being directed from on high and I'm just telling the listeners this broadcast
[3:44:19.500 --> 3:44:21.500]  Without you

[3:44:58.020 --> 3:45:04.580]  I've been on the air so long that I take it for granted now when we break some massive story
[3:45:05.180 --> 3:45:06.340]  that

[3:45:15.740 --> 3:45:19.700]  And that's why I need to pull back and ask the listeners because I know you're a lot like me

[3:48:01.420 --> 3:48:03.740]  Again, it's about to swing states and
[3:48:06.980 --> 3:48:09.460]  Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren
[3:48:10.620 --> 3:48:15.820]  They ain't gonna swing in the swing states. I mean ain't gonna happen and Biden
[3:48:15.820 --> 3:48:23.060]  Pfft this impeachment thing is really gonna hurt him as more and more dirt comes out if he's the cat
[3:48:23.060 --> 3:48:27.380]  That's gonna be running against Trump about all the dirty deals
[3:48:28.420 --> 3:48:30.420]  That the Biden disres boys
[3:48:31.100 --> 3:48:32.540]  That's right
[3:48:32.540 --> 3:48:38.040]  The hunter the hunting for free jobs and free money because daddy got the inside deal
[3:48:38.740 --> 3:48:41.980]  plus plus plus so anything not gonna beat them and
[3:48:41.980 --> 3:48:44.940]  And what's that guy Bloomberg?
[3:48:45.940 --> 3:48:51.540]  Bloomberg the billionaire running them ads Bloomberg's going nowhere
[3:48:52.100 --> 3:48:58.260]  No, we're no how no way. I don't see it happening. The guy that arrogant personality is
[3:48:59.660 --> 3:49:01.660]  Ain't gonna happen. Oh
[3:49:03.300 --> 3:49:08.420]  The blacks and Latinos are gonna love him. Yeah, the guy that gave you
[3:49:08.420 --> 3:49:13.260]  Stopping frisk in New York City

[3:49:24.940 --> 3:49:26.940]  He has Bloomberg
[3:49:27.340 --> 3:49:31.940]  Defended the violation of our rights gonna stop that frisk
[3:49:31.940 --> 3:49:37.420]  Up until he announced he's running for president
[3:49:38.180 --> 3:49:39.420]  Yeah
[3:49:39.420 --> 3:49:41.420]  What a low-life
[3:49:41.500 --> 3:49:43.500]  garbage man
[3:49:43.820 --> 3:49:51.380]  Or I should say Bloomberg boy because all these guys are so tough when they got their
[3:49:52.260 --> 3:49:55.060]  Big guys around them to protect them
[3:49:55.060 --> 3:50:02.140]  Couldn't fight his way out of a paper bag like most of them like a shipper guy too, right?
[3:50:02.140 --> 3:50:06.900]  Yeah, I can't spell it the way I want but take out that other words and put a T at the end
[3:50:07.580 --> 3:50:09.580]  little boys
[3:50:10.740 --> 3:50:12.740]  Anyway
[3:50:12.740 --> 3:50:18.020]  And when I talk about Bloomberg one of our other big trends is off with their heads 2.0
[3:50:18.300 --> 3:50:22.460]  You got riots going on around the world. I mentioned some of them before
[3:50:22.460 --> 3:50:24.980]  You know what the big issue is?
[3:50:25.580 --> 3:50:28.180]  Hey, they got all the dough and we got none
[3:50:29.020 --> 3:50:34.660]  Income inequality. That's the one thing that the Occupy Wall Street brought out
[3:50:35.540 --> 3:50:41.340]  That the few cats got all the dough and the rest of us we got to keep working and working to get everything that we have
[3:50:41.900 --> 3:50:45.780]  And it's just us they commit the crimes of
[3:50:46.580 --> 3:50:48.180]  trillions
[3:50:48.180 --> 3:50:54.660]  It is too big to jail. Yeah, you remember that Eric Holder. You remember that hold it is
[3:50:55.660 --> 3:50:57.660]  another low life
[3:50:58.460 --> 3:51:00.980]  Slimer too big to jail
[3:51:01.780 --> 3:51:07.860]  Hey, yeah, you went over to speed limit your ten miles over the speed limit. You don't have your parking light on
[3:51:08.220 --> 3:51:13.740]  Yeah, right over your license plate is off. Where were you get out of the car stand on your head
[3:51:13.740 --> 3:51:22.500]  Repeat the alphabet backwards just us off with their heads when people lose everything and have nothing left to lose
[3:51:22.500 --> 3:51:27.860]  They lose it and they're losing it around the world. They're losing in Lebanon. They're losing in Algeria. They're losing in France
[3:51:27.980 --> 3:51:31.860]  They're losing in Chile. They're losing in Columbia, Bolivia, Peru
[3:51:32.380 --> 3:51:34.380]  They're losing it around the world
[3:51:36.020 --> 3:51:41.820]  So these cats are gonna get more than bodyguards around them and find safe haven places to go to
[3:51:41.820 --> 3:51:43.820]  Some other trends
[3:51:44.700 --> 3:51:46.700]  some other trends
[3:51:47.780 --> 3:51:51.380]  Independence that's right follow. No need up
[3:51:51.940 --> 3:51:55.860]  It does not take a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority
[3:51:56.460 --> 3:51:59.380]  keen on setting brush fires of freedom in the minds of men
[3:52:00.540 --> 3:52:07.100]  Samuel Adams and that's what's going on around the world every place that I mentioned all those places
[3:52:08.060 --> 3:52:10.060]  Hong Kong France
[3:52:10.060 --> 3:52:12.620]  Bolivia Chile one after another
[3:52:13.420 --> 3:52:20.820]  No leaders the people are leading themselves. I don't need anybody to lead me Gabby's and I
[3:52:23.060 --> 3:52:28.020]  Was not put on this earth to take orders. I don't give them. I don't take them
[3:52:28.700 --> 3:52:34.220]  Do I follow instructions? Of course I do. Doctor tells me to do this or that and I believe in what they're saying
[3:52:34.220 --> 3:52:42.420]  I'm all ears in an open mind. Anybody that knows more than I do about different feels love to listen and a lot of feels
[3:52:42.420 --> 3:52:44.060]  I don't know anything about
[3:52:44.060 --> 3:52:46.540]  But I don't follow orders. I saw Lou
[3:52:49.660 --> 3:52:56.500]  Independence and a big one this is for the entrepreneurs the roaring
[3:52:57.220 --> 3:52:59.220]  2020s people are down
[3:53:00.020 --> 3:53:02.100]  Look at all these movies. They put out
[3:53:02.100 --> 3:53:03.260]  Oh
[3:53:03.260 --> 3:53:08.600]  Star Wars again. Oh, yeah, the cat the kitten. This is a lot old. Yeah
[3:53:10.740 --> 3:53:15.140]  No happiness no joy. No feeling up. No feeling high
[3:53:16.420 --> 3:53:20.860]  The roaring 2020s the people are ready to break loose
[3:53:22.100 --> 3:53:29.140]  The smart entrepreneurs that give them that with elegance and it doesn't take a lot to be elegant
[3:53:29.140 --> 3:53:35.820]  You could buy stuff online secondhand from the highest levels the pennies on the dollar
[3:53:37.100 --> 3:53:39.100]  Go back to the Great Depression
[3:53:39.700 --> 3:53:46.220]  Hardest happiest music of Merrick Avenue. It was swing time. I have a photo of my parents wedding
[3:53:46.220 --> 3:53:49.020]  May their souls rest in peace Italian immigrants
[3:53:50.980 --> 3:53:56.780]  Dressed to the nines 1934 there were laborers worth in factories
[3:53:56.780 --> 3:53:58.780]  fish stores
[3:54:00.620 --> 3:54:02.620]  Vegetables
[3:54:03.940 --> 3:54:05.940]  Dressed beautifully
[3:54:07.420 --> 3:54:12.820]  Elegance this thing's going down not next year, but 2021's my year for the down
[3:54:14.140 --> 3:54:20.380]  People ask me what could I do get in the best shape you can physically emotionally and spiritually raise the level
[3:54:21.060 --> 3:54:24.860]  Step it up. Hey, you know that saying pigs can't fly
[3:54:24.860 --> 3:54:26.860]  You've heard that
[3:54:27.500 --> 3:54:29.500]  Been to the airport lately
[3:54:30.060 --> 3:54:32.060]  Look at the way people look
[3:54:32.740 --> 3:54:37.060]  People from around the world come in. I can't believe it. How low can you go?
[3:54:38.140 --> 3:54:42.820]  Not in the roaring 2020s. These are the entrepreneur
[3:54:44.180 --> 3:54:48.380]  Opportunities and again, you can get all this in your trends journal
[3:54:48.380 --> 3:54:57.460]  It's the only magazine in the world that tells you what's going on? What it means and where it's going
[3:55:01.780 --> 3:55:09.140]  Time magazine last week's news next week trends journal tomorrow's news today and again remember
[3:55:09.140 --> 3:55:19.180]  Do what you can to support info wars this year next year and many years to come because
[3:55:21.460 --> 3:55:23.860]  Info wars is putting out information
[3:55:25.620 --> 3:55:31.820]  That's the truth and helps you prepare the mainstream media is a stupid wasted joke
[3:55:32.980 --> 3:55:34.980]  again
[3:55:34.980 --> 3:55:38.500]  A couple of people die 5-10 people die in a
[3:55:39.420 --> 3:55:45.380]  Volcano in New Zealand terrible story very sad for the people, but that's not going to help me
[3:55:46.100 --> 3:55:49.660]  Learn about what's going on in the world and how to prepare for it
[3:55:50.500 --> 3:55:52.500]  so
[3:55:54.180 --> 3:55:56.180]  Real estate
[3:55:56.460 --> 3:56:00.220]  This is going to be the peak year you're going to lower interest rates
[3:56:00.220 --> 3:56:04.580]  By this time next year. We believe we're going to see him down to
[3:56:05.420 --> 3:56:10.340]  Zero to negative percent. So it's going to keep boosting the market, but in the big cities
[3:56:10.340 --> 3:56:16.180]  It's already slowing down New York New York, New York one for rent sign on
[3:56:16.700 --> 3:56:18.700]  Fifth Avenue
[3:56:18.940 --> 3:56:21.020]  Madison Avenue. Yeah
[3:56:22.100 --> 3:56:23.860]  It's Pete
[3:56:23.860 --> 3:56:27.020]  Overseas forget about it Melbourne Sydney
[3:56:27.020 --> 3:56:29.020]  Shoot down
[3:56:29.780 --> 3:56:31.780]  so
[3:56:32.340 --> 3:56:34.340]  What you can do is
[3:56:34.540 --> 3:56:38.180]  Profit from the future that doesn't mean you shouldn't buy real estate
[3:56:38.180 --> 3:56:43.020]  I'm not I don't tell anybody what to do and gold. I still see gold being golden
[3:56:43.620 --> 3:56:49.540]  Even with the markets going up and they keep hitting new highs because all that cheap money coming into the repo markets
[3:56:49.700 --> 3:56:51.700]  Gold is still doing well
[3:56:51.820 --> 3:56:55.500]  So remember has to break below 1450 from there
[3:56:55.500 --> 3:57:03.220]  I see the 1390 breaks above 1415 70 shoot. I see it headed toward 2000
[3:57:03.820 --> 3:57:06.900]  This is a wild ride into the future prepare yourself
[3:57:07.340 --> 3:57:14.100]  Step it up. It's the roaring 2020s feel good about you about yourself and about everything else
[3:57:14.700 --> 3:57:19.940]  That could bring you higher the futures in your hands. Don't drop it
[3:57:19.940 --> 3:57:27.780]  You create the future the people of info wars the people subscribe to the trends journal the people that want freedom
[3:57:28.140 --> 3:57:30.140]  Justice in the American way
[3:57:30.900 --> 3:57:32.900]  You're the future
[3:57:33.540 --> 3:57:36.820]  Don't let anybody tell you differently because if they do
[3:57:36.820 --> 3:57:49.500]  You're out of luck. Thank you very much. See you next time
