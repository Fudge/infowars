[00:00.000 --> 00:14.600]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:14.600 --> 00:21.520]  Born in 1950 in East Germany and lasting 40 years, the Stasi was the official state
[00:21.520 --> 00:23.080]  security service.
[00:23.080 --> 00:29.440]  It was one of the most effective and repressive intelligence and secret police agencies that
[00:29.440 --> 00:30.440]  ever existed.
[00:30.440 --> 00:38.040]  They were known as the sword and the shield of the ruling socialist unity party of Germany.
[00:38.040 --> 00:42.840]  In 1989, East German citizens stormed the Berlin headquarters of the secret police,
[00:42.840 --> 00:43.840]  the Stasi.
[00:43.840 --> 00:47.960]  Its employees tried to destroy the files of the people who informed on their neighbors
[00:47.960 --> 00:48.960]  and friends.
[00:48.960 --> 00:55.720]  The expansion of the DC Capitol Police reeks of a democratic overreach via a nationwide
[00:55.720 --> 01:02.840]  Stasi-esque force emboldened by the clear cold blooded murder of Ashley Babbitt by a still
[01:02.840 --> 01:07.440]  unconfirmed killer within the U.S. Capitol Police ranks.
[01:07.440 --> 01:11.000]  Wednesday, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia and the Civil Rights
[01:11.000 --> 01:14.800]  Division of the U.S. Department of Justice announced there will be no criminal charges
[01:14.800 --> 01:18.200]  against the U.S. Capitol Police officer who fatally shot Babbitt.
[01:18.200 --> 01:24.280]  Now Pelosi's attack dogs are chomping at the bit to hunt down potential political prisoners
[01:24.280 --> 01:31.640]  that disagree with their overlords after upending the lives of at least 500 protesters who were
[01:31.640 --> 01:38.800]  merely exercising their First Amendment rights on January 6th, a stark contrast to the support
[01:38.800 --> 01:44.440]  of the vice president, no less, of the rioting, burning, murdering, and looting of American
[01:44.440 --> 01:50.640]  businesses, police stations, and federal buildings that were decimated for months.
[01:50.640 --> 01:55.320]  On end, all in the name of the Democrats' lies and fear-mongering.
[01:55.320 --> 01:58.400]  How important is it for this protest to continue?
[01:58.400 --> 01:59.400]  It's critically important.
[01:59.400 --> 02:00.400]  I'm going to tell you something.
[02:00.400 --> 02:01.400]  But they're not going to stop.
[02:01.400 --> 02:02.400]  They're not going to stop.
[02:02.400 --> 02:06.560]  And this is a movement I'm telling you.
[02:06.560 --> 02:08.480]  They're not going to stop.
[02:08.480 --> 02:14.200]  And everyone beware, because they're not going to stop before Election Day in November
[02:14.200 --> 02:16.600]  and they're not going to stop after Election Day.
[02:16.600 --> 02:23.000]  The announcement of the expansion of the Capitol Police follows a July 6th press release from
[02:23.000 --> 02:29.440]  the Capitol Police titled After the Attack, the future of the U.S. Capitol Police.
[02:29.440 --> 02:36.240]  The release announces a pivot towards an intelligence-based protective agency expanded
[02:36.240 --> 02:43.800]  wellness services to handle all of the trauma lying dimwits like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
[02:43.800 --> 02:48.440]  experienced.
[02:48.440 --> 02:57.000]  And so I opened the door when all of a sudden I hear that whoever was trying to get inside
[02:57.000 --> 02:59.040]  got into my office.
[02:59.040 --> 03:05.320]  And then I just start to hear these yells of, where is she?
[03:05.320 --> 03:06.320]  Where is she?
[03:06.320 --> 03:11.960]  The story she's telling, then, you're basically saying is absolutely not true.
[03:11.960 --> 03:12.960]  It's not true.
[03:12.960 --> 03:18.200]  I simply made that statement a fact earlier today and she literally lost it on her favorite
[03:18.200 --> 03:20.800]  social media platform, Twitter.
[03:20.800 --> 03:24.440]  And so I know I'm doing the right thing, doing the right job when I've got members of the
[03:24.440 --> 03:28.080]  squad coming after me all day long on Twitter.
[03:28.080 --> 03:32.400]  And as the old adage goes, Sean, judge a woman by the enemies she keeps.
[03:32.400 --> 03:34.520]  And I'm totally fine with that.
[03:34.520 --> 03:40.760]  Enhanced member protection, which would enhance staffing within the Dignitary Protection Division
[03:40.760 --> 03:47.040]  as well as coordinated enhanced security for members of Congress outside of the National
[03:47.040 --> 03:48.440]  Capital Region.
[03:48.440 --> 03:55.160]  The Department is also in the process of opening regional field offices in California and Florida
[03:55.160 --> 04:02.320]  with additional regions in the near future to investigate threats to members of Congress.
[04:02.320 --> 04:07.920]  The Department is also increasing its use of force, tactical equipment, leadership,
[04:07.920 --> 04:13.800]  local guard alert process, and incident command training, while countless terrorists pour
[04:13.800 --> 04:19.040]  over the southern border and cartels expand their foothold in the United States.
[04:19.040 --> 04:23.600]  But cartels are continuing to infiltrate parts of the Southland.
[04:23.600 --> 04:28.240]  It's fueling an explosion of illegal marijuana growing operations, much of it in the Envelope
[04:28.240 --> 04:31.120]  Valley and Acton and Ogledil State.
[04:31.120 --> 04:36.560]  In the very near future, social media will be flooded with predictable woke recruitment
[04:36.560 --> 04:42.720]  ads, training a Socialist Democratic Party Army hell-bent on controlling the narrative
[04:42.720 --> 04:49.560]  of power by hunting down its lone enemy, the American people, John Bown reporting.
[04:49.560 --> 05:05.880]  Iodine is one of the most important drivers of the body for fertility, for cellular function,
[05:05.880 --> 05:06.880]  for libido, for life.
[05:06.880 --> 05:10.800]  If you don't have iodine, you die in a matter of months.
[05:10.800 --> 05:12.560]  So if you don't have oxygen, you die in four minutes.
[05:12.560 --> 05:14.680]  If you don't have water, you die in a week or so.
[05:14.680 --> 05:16.560]  If you don't have food, a month or so.
[05:16.560 --> 05:17.560]  But what's in that food?
[05:17.560 --> 05:18.560]  Iodine.
[05:18.560 --> 05:24.160]  If your food doesn't have that atomic pure iodine, it can't operate, and the food itself
[05:24.160 --> 05:25.160]  is lacking.
[05:25.160 --> 05:29.560]  That's why most people on earth are deficient in iodine, and governments are lowering the
[05:29.560 --> 05:32.680]  allowance you're supposedly going to need to have because they want control.
[05:32.680 --> 05:34.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, our information is powerful.
[05:34.880 --> 05:36.920]  Our products are just as powerful.

[05:52.200 --> 05:54.040]  They don't want you to experience this.

[06:50.720 --> 07:20.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us today.
[07:20.560 --> 07:28.120]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live July 15, Thursday broadcast.
[07:28.120 --> 07:33.080]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and I'm very, very blessed and honored to be here with you.
[07:33.080 --> 07:38.360]  A lot of people wanted Tucker Carlson to weigh in on claims of election fraud six, seven months
[07:38.360 --> 07:40.800]  ago, but he didn't do it.
[07:40.800 --> 07:47.480]  He said he was waiting until these detailed, hand-counted audits were done and that he would
[07:47.480 --> 07:48.480]  then respond.
[07:48.480 --> 07:53.240]  And now he's come out and said the same thing we've all said, it's 100% private third party
[07:53.240 --> 08:03.680]  groups that have confirmed that in Georgia and in Arizona and all over these places
[08:03.680 --> 08:17.440]  where Trump was winning right before, and then the polls closed, and he's still winning,
[08:17.440 --> 08:21.680]  and then they stopped counting in the middle of the night, and then we all wake up.
[08:21.680 --> 08:31.480]  And suddenly, ladies and gentlemen, Biden had surged to the front and had been able
[08:31.480 --> 08:45.520]  to quote take the election, and the Republican Party establishment was then able to stand
[08:45.520 --> 08:53.320]  down and the rest is history.
[08:53.320 --> 09:01.360]  Now they are not about to let us try to reverse this, and in fact, they have a plan to bring
[09:01.360 --> 09:05.240]  in a permanent state of emergency and martial law using COVID as the cover and race war
[09:05.240 --> 09:13.440]  as the cover, and they have no intention of ever allowing the midterms to take place coming
[09:13.440 --> 09:15.920]  up in less than a year and a half.
[09:15.920 --> 09:22.040]  Now you'll remember I said on this show and on Joe Rogan's show days before the election
[09:22.040 --> 09:26.680]  that Trump's going to win in these battleground states by even bigger margin, and then after
[09:26.680 --> 09:33.560]  the polls closed, they're going to say that Biden magically won because of mail-in ballots.
[09:33.560 --> 09:37.600]  Exactly what I said happened, and you know, it wasn't very hard to predict that because
[09:37.600 --> 09:46.160]  the Democrats said, no matter what happens, no matter what goes on, no matter what it
[09:46.160 --> 09:51.600]  shows, we're never going to accept Trump, and we'll even have our own convention, and
[09:51.600 --> 09:54.880]  we'll even have our own inauguration, and we'll just break the country up.
[09:54.880 --> 10:05.040]  That was in the New York Times with John Podesta, the chief strategist for the Democrats.
[10:05.040 --> 10:09.440]  So they said there's a red mirage that will look like he wins the landslide, but don't
[10:09.440 --> 10:17.160]  worry, we'll produce whatever amount of mail-in ballots we need, he will not be the president.
[10:17.160 --> 10:20.320]  So they telegraphed their operation, they told the whole world what they were going
[10:20.320 --> 10:32.840]  to do, and now they did it, and they have no intention of letting the American people
[10:32.840 --> 10:35.600]  ever rest control of our country back.
[10:35.600 --> 10:45.320]  This is a criminal takeover, this is a multinational corporate chai combat coup, and no once-free
[10:45.320 --> 10:48.120]  country will ever come out of this again.
[10:48.120 --> 10:53.880]  We are turning into a high-tech version of North Korea, and I don't say that to be
[10:53.880 --> 10:58.680]  gloom and doom, I say that so you know how much trouble we're in.
[10:58.680 --> 11:02.560]  We told you this was coming, we warned you, we showed you what the UN was planning, we
[11:02.560 --> 11:06.680]  showed you what the universities were planning, we showed you their whole operation, they
[11:06.680 --> 11:11.280]  weren't spending trillions of stolen money to do this for nothing, George Soros wasn't
[11:11.280 --> 11:15.400]  buying off all the DAs and putting all his people in for no reason, they're going to
[11:15.400 --> 11:21.360]  arrest all their opposition, let their people commit murders everywhere, human trafficking,
[11:21.360 --> 11:29.120]  narcotics dealing, I mean this is a well-thought-out criminal takedown.
[11:29.120 --> 11:38.480]  The FBI's control, the Justice Department, it's all shot, it's all gone, country is gone.
[11:38.480 --> 11:43.440]  Now I don't say that to be negative, I say that to be able to realize that playing along
[11:43.440 --> 11:48.520]  with it and just interfacing with each issue as it comes, like they're not all connected,
[11:48.520 --> 11:49.960]  is going to defeat us.
[11:49.960 --> 11:55.760]  If we fully understand this is a UN world government takeover, chai combat, if we fully
[11:55.760 --> 12:01.680]  realize they're even admitting that, we fully realize it's completely illegitimate and we
[12:01.680 --> 12:07.180]  all speak out and we don't comply and we demonstrate and we file lawsuits and we start our own
[12:07.180 --> 12:12.960]  media organizations and we all stop complying with civil disobedience and just continue
[12:12.960 --> 12:17.560]  to get in their gaslighting faces and say, we know you're a fraud, we know you're a foreign
[12:17.560 --> 12:22.320]  multinational takeover, here are all the crimes you committed, you launched COVID-19, you
[12:22.320 --> 12:29.160]  suppressed the treatments, you censored the American people, you're a criminal organization,
[12:29.160 --> 12:32.920]  the public will completely break with them and they will be defeated, they'll end up
[12:32.920 --> 12:34.760]  going to prison.
[12:34.760 --> 12:42.000]  If not we are going into the long, dark night of hell on earth, the globalists want to torture
[12:42.000 --> 12:47.440]  Americans, they want to rape your wife, they want to burn your house down, they want to
[12:47.440 --> 12:52.360]  kill, what George Soros has been doing since a teenager, he called it the best time of
[12:52.360 --> 12:58.320]  his life, happy making, robbing and stealing and killing and rounding up Jews and he sent
[12:58.320 --> 13:04.720]  the death camps and he's on 60 minutes and on NPR saying it was the exhilarating, best
[13:04.720 --> 13:11.080]  time of his life, the feeling of invincibility to round up and kill all those people and
[13:11.080 --> 13:16.440]  you're not like Soros and I'm not like that demon and his demon son, but Bill Gates is
[13:16.440 --> 13:23.880]  this and Warren Buffett is and all these other globalists are and they see your naivete as
[13:23.880 --> 13:28.800]  a green light to rape the living hell out of you.
[13:28.800 --> 13:38.520]  So when we come back, we're going to get to the incredible proof, 100% of the absentee
[13:38.520 --> 13:48.840]  ballots at hundreds of drop points, thousands in some cases per drop, 100% for Joe Biden
[13:48.840 --> 13:58.280]  and in many cases filled in by a machine, fraudulent, just like the USPS driver was driving out of
[13:58.280 --> 14:02.040]  one state to another with a whole truck full of ballots so he opened it up and they were
[14:02.040 --> 14:10.120]  all done by a computer, not by pencil or pen and so he called the federal government and
[14:10.120 --> 14:15.280]  the FBI came and said, well, arrest your ass, you don't shut your mouth, boy, because the
[14:15.280 --> 14:19.760]  order was and it was now come out as of two days ago, was a suppressed election fraud
[14:19.760 --> 14:22.760]  at news.
[14:22.760 --> 14:27.640]  So it's all out now and of course they did, of course they stole it and we even have the
[14:27.640 --> 14:32.800]  videos in Georgia of them saying a water main broke, which it didn't, kicking everybody
[14:32.800 --> 14:38.120]  out and then a bunch of Democrat party operatives pull the suitcases out but there weren't enough
[14:38.120 --> 14:42.360]  suitcases, even though there were thousands of ballots, to run them all once and beat
[14:42.360 --> 14:52.000]  Trump in that county there in Atlanta and so they had to run it each suitcase, each
[14:52.000 --> 14:59.400]  briefcase, each box over and over and over and over again and because of election fraud
[14:59.400 --> 15:05.560]  safeguards there are scans of those, photos of those ballots and we now know that they
[15:05.560 --> 15:10.920]  did it so we have them in the whole act, it'd be like if you had video, it'd be like if
[15:10.920 --> 15:15.540]  Jeffrey Dahmer videoed kidnapping people, injecting bleach in their brains, using the
[15:15.540 --> 15:20.160]  sex slaves till they died and then cutting them up and eating them, I mean, it's that
[15:20.160 --> 15:25.120]  bad, we have them bringing them in, saying there's a water main break that didn't happen,
[15:25.120 --> 15:28.960]  pulling out the ballots that were all for Joe Biden and running them through over and
[15:28.960 --> 15:35.680]  over again, I mean, you can't get more, you don't get more open of shot, oh but General
[15:35.680 --> 15:41.000]  Milley says, kind of gone, I'll smash your ass, I was right over war, have you talked
[15:41.000 --> 15:47.360]  about it, he says you're a terrorist and he says, the army rangers are coming to get you,
[15:47.360 --> 15:53.000]  I'd like to see your big fat ass try that, you communist filth, burn in hell, you and
[15:53.000 --> 16:02.280]  Austin, you commie traitors, burn in hell maggots, America will beat you.
[16:02.280 --> 16:08.400]  Your voice counts, when you share information be it over the internet or in person, it changes
[16:08.400 --> 16:13.400]  the world, the globalists know their agenda is unpopular, they know you're angry and
[16:13.400 --> 16:18.360]  now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.
[16:18.360 --> 16:22.920]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, if you sign up for our free news and show alerts, you can

[17:00.280 --> 17:06.280]  The world is awakening, the world is beginning to understand the globalist paradigm, they
[17:06.280 --> 17:11.600]  are discovering the globalist, the elites, the manipulation, the CFR, the trilateral
[17:11.600 --> 17:18.640]  commission, the Bilderberg group, the Bohemian Grove, the club of Rome and so even though
[17:18.640 --> 17:23.200]  it seems like the globalists are winning, the truth is they've had to come out the
[17:23.200 --> 17:27.320]  open to attack human freedom because they're actually losing.
[17:27.320 --> 17:32.840]  We have forced them out in the open, so as bad as these times are, a lot of negative
[17:32.840 --> 17:37.640]  things are about to happen, realize humanity is winning, you've got to trust in the plan
[17:37.640 --> 17:44.880]  of God and trust in the plan of God's justice, that is invincible, that is ethereal, timeless
[17:44.880 --> 17:50.360]  and unstoppable, so don't trust in man, trust in God to lead God and direct your soul and
[17:50.360 --> 17:54.080]  then take action against the globalists and realize you've got my commitment from Alex
[17:54.080 --> 17:59.160]  Jones and my crew to you, we will never back down from the globalists and we will never
[17:59.160 --> 18:00.160]  surrender.
[18:00.160 --> 18:05.640]  X2 has been our number one bestseller over the years, deep earth crystal iodine, the
[18:05.640 --> 18:10.960]  good halogen, it is essential for all actions in the body, you must have it to live.
[18:10.960 --> 18:14.000]  The UN estimates 2 billion plus people have cognitive disabilities because they don't
[18:14.000 --> 18:15.120]  have it of iodine.
[18:15.120 --> 18:19.080]  We have X2 at two different bottles, same amount in each bottle, but one has a spray
[18:19.080 --> 18:25.480]  top, one has a dropper top, 60% off on the spray top, 40% off on the dropper top for
[18:25.480 --> 18:28.000]  a limited time because they're both selling out.
[18:28.000 --> 18:31.080]  I want to thank all the supporters that have gotten these over the years, they're amazing,
[18:31.080 --> 18:35.240]  so that's a great deal for you to stock up on it, but this deal is really for folks that
[18:35.240 --> 18:39.040]  have been on the fence and haven't experienced the good halogen for yourself.
[18:39.040 --> 18:44.200]  So X2, the dropper bottle and the spray bottle, 60 and 40% off for a limited time because it's
[18:44.200 --> 18:48.000]  selling out right now at infowarstore.com, but we're going to keep this sale going until
[18:48.000 --> 18:52.040]  it sells out, it'll probably take about two weeks, don't procrastinate, take advantage
[18:52.040 --> 18:56.000]  of this special right now at infowarstore.com and check out the new products we just got
[18:56.000 --> 19:03.000]  in as well.
[19:26.000 --> 19:40.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, the critical race theory is classical Marxist liberation theology to
[19:40.000 --> 19:46.400]  purge the federal government of anybody that does not adopt the rest of the Marxist propaganda.
[19:46.400 --> 19:47.400]  It's dog training.
[19:47.400 --> 19:51.520]  If you don't do what we say and if you don't support socialism and globalism and open
[19:51.520 --> 19:57.320]  borders, we're going to say you're a racist and they're going out of the army and the
[19:57.320 --> 20:03.560]  Marines and the Navy with the most virulent forms of it.
[20:03.560 --> 20:05.840]  The bad guys have hijacked the nation.
[20:05.840 --> 20:10.640]  They're wearing our uniforms now at the top, just like when the hijackers in the old days
[20:10.640 --> 20:15.920]  were smart, they would put on uniforms of the captains and they noticed that people would
[20:15.920 --> 20:21.680]  normally submit more when they actually dressed up like they were in charge.
[20:21.680 --> 20:25.520]  Even though the people knew that's not the captain, that's not the co-pilot.
[20:25.520 --> 20:29.440]  And so when you see General Milley, you see Austin, the Secretary of Defense, those are
[20:29.440 --> 20:33.200]  literal globalist agents here to destroy the country.
[20:33.200 --> 20:36.800]  But let me go ahead and just show you some evidence of that because it's all part of
[20:36.800 --> 20:38.920]  the same group.
[20:38.920 --> 20:39.920]  Why just single them out?
[20:39.920 --> 20:49.600]  Look at this headline, video, White House refuses to condemn Communist Cuba tyranny.
[20:49.600 --> 20:54.000]  Instead says it's mismanagement.
[20:54.000 --> 20:58.200]  They manage it to make you poor on purpose to control you.
[20:58.200 --> 20:59.200]  That's who the people are.
[20:59.200 --> 21:06.840]  Oh, Secretary of State, Blinken says that he's calling for a UN investigation of American
[21:06.840 --> 21:13.040]  racism and says the country is bad, but does it call for a UN investigation of three million
[21:13.040 --> 21:17.040]  Muslims and death camps, one million Christians and mutas conservatively, many of which have
[21:17.040 --> 21:18.040]  their organs sold?
[21:18.040 --> 21:19.400]  Oh, no, no, no.
[21:19.400 --> 21:22.600]  It's all how America's bad.
[21:22.600 --> 21:26.560]  Responsible nations must not shrink from the scrutiny of their human rights record.
[21:26.560 --> 21:30.200]  You have the UN human rights board run by Islamists and people.
[21:30.200 --> 21:34.680]  Rather they should be transparent with the intent to grow and do better.
[21:34.680 --> 21:39.760]  That is why I'm announcing a formal invitation for UN special rapporteur on contemporary
[21:39.760 --> 21:42.440]  forms of racism to visit the United States.
[21:42.440 --> 21:45.520]  The UN is our boss.
[21:45.520 --> 21:51.680]  Blinken invites the UN to investigate contemporary forms of racism, like Millie said, he goes,
[21:51.680 --> 21:52.680]  I'm white.
[21:52.680 --> 21:56.400]  I don't know why whites are bad, why they attack the Capitol, I don't know why we're
[21:56.400 --> 21:57.400]  evil.
[21:57.400 --> 22:01.280]  I don't know why question and election means you're a white supremacist.
[22:01.280 --> 22:06.640]  That's exactly what's in the new report put out that same week he testified saying questioning
[22:06.640 --> 22:10.480]  elections as white supremacism, questioning lockdowns as white supremacism, says it word
[22:10.480 --> 22:14.280]  for word, and then says the Pentagon and CIA will get you.
[22:14.280 --> 22:15.640]  Oh, I'm so scared.
[22:15.640 --> 22:20.080]  I'm scared of not resisting and exposing you horrible criminals that have hijacked our
[22:20.080 --> 22:21.080]  damn nation.
[22:21.080 --> 22:24.240]  God almighty.
[22:24.240 --> 22:28.700]  Blinken invites you in to investigate contemporary forms of racism in the US, but not a word
[22:28.700 --> 22:32.040]  about China and the death camps.
[22:32.040 --> 22:34.280]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[22:34.280 --> 22:38.440]  Meanwhile, it's a war zone, South Africa to deploy 25,000 troops as country on the
[22:38.440 --> 22:39.440]  break of civil war.
[22:39.440 --> 22:43.240]  Hell, it's the government that's been saying, I've got all the videos on the news, you know,
[22:43.240 --> 22:48.920]  even though there's total Marxist like evil Indians have killed two black people.
[22:48.920 --> 22:52.800]  And so Indians will all be hunted down and killed because Indians colonize all over the
[22:52.800 --> 22:53.800]  world.
[22:53.800 --> 22:56.840]  You know, they want jobs, not a bad word, colonizing, they move places.
[22:56.840 --> 22:58.280]  And so there's evil Indians.
[22:58.280 --> 23:00.040]  They're now the new white people.
[23:00.040 --> 23:04.080]  And so when they fight back and want their houses burned to the ground or shops, it's
[23:04.080 --> 23:06.920]  been announced now that you will all pay.
[23:06.920 --> 23:07.920]  And people are on Twitter.
[23:07.920 --> 23:08.920]  I saw it.
[23:08.920 --> 23:10.640]  Oh, yeah, Indians are bad people.
[23:10.640 --> 23:13.280]  Always white people are like, yeah, get the Indians.
[23:13.280 --> 23:18.600]  They're not submitting to communist blacks, which is a minority of the blacks, but still
[23:18.600 --> 23:22.920]  the government's communist, burning everything down and killing everybody.
[23:22.920 --> 23:23.920]  There you go.
[23:23.920 --> 23:24.920]  That's right.
[23:24.920 --> 23:28.240]  Oh, the left's all very upset that some of the looters have been killed.
[23:28.240 --> 23:32.800]  South Africans struggling to find food after looting everything.
[23:32.800 --> 23:34.880]  Army activates all reserve members.
[23:34.880 --> 23:41.560]  It's going the way of Zimbabwe, formerly Rhodesia, bye-bye, South Africa.
[23:41.560 --> 23:46.240]  Horrible BLM issues statement supporting Marxist Cuban tyranny.
[23:46.240 --> 23:50.360]  Oh, yes, they've raised billions of dollars.
[23:50.360 --> 23:55.080]  They live in palatial homes, private jets, but they were founded by Marxist.
[23:55.080 --> 23:59.280]  They admire a cop-killing woman that lives in Cuba from the United States.
[23:59.280 --> 24:04.880]  And they have put out a statement praising the government, cracking down.
[24:04.880 --> 24:09.000]  I guess they didn't know that about a third of the Cuban population is black or more,
[24:09.000 --> 24:11.560]  and that there are a lot of the folks who find it, but it's okay.
[24:11.560 --> 24:14.560]  Black Lives Matter supports communism, so make sure you get them.
[24:14.560 --> 24:19.400]  Of course, they're not burning each other's grocery stores and houses and things in Cuba.
[24:19.400 --> 24:23.280]  They're going and protesting the corrupt government and facing years in prison for it.
[24:23.280 --> 24:25.200]  They know how to protest.
[24:25.200 --> 24:29.280]  Pop star Pit Bull calls on Jeff Bezos to provide aid to Cuban people.
[24:29.280 --> 24:31.080]  I wouldn't hold your breath there, buddy boy.
[24:31.080 --> 24:35.560]  Wake up because this is about freedom and human rights, and Bezos was reportedly adopted
[24:35.560 --> 24:40.720]  by a Cuban father, but wouldn't hold your breath with old Bezos.
[24:40.720 --> 24:44.840]  South Africans struggling to find food after looting everything.
[24:44.840 --> 24:47.200]  Again, but that's okay.
[24:47.200 --> 24:51.640]  We're going to be going over all of that here in the book.
[24:51.640 --> 24:57.880]  Why don't I read that because Biden's not criticizing what's happening in Cuba and not
[24:57.880 --> 24:58.880]  standing up for those people.
[24:58.880 --> 25:01.840]  She's saying, oh, it's COVID caused the mismanagement.
[25:01.840 --> 25:07.520]  BOM is defending what's happening in Cuba, saying it's a good thing.
[25:07.520 --> 25:13.200]  Our own Pentagon chairman of the Joint Chief goes, I've read Stalin and Lenin.
[25:13.200 --> 25:15.360]  What's wrong with that?
[25:15.360 --> 25:18.760]  I mean, Harvard came up with this critical race theory.
[25:18.760 --> 25:22.840]  So when it comes out of Harvard, well, we better just do right away.
[25:22.840 --> 25:27.200]  And then they take it and apply it to elementary students, teaching them that whites have an
[25:27.200 --> 25:32.920]  advantage and whites did something wrong, which just creates total division on purpose.
[25:32.920 --> 25:34.480]  We're being divided and conquered.
[25:34.480 --> 25:40.120]  And they set up their knowing damn well what they're doing, following orders.
[25:40.120 --> 25:45.720]  Because Austin and Millie are up there because they are globalist.
[25:45.720 --> 25:51.800]  And Honore advised, and I told you, federal rapid reaction force above the law, secret
[25:51.800 --> 25:54.400]  police, no for your request.
[25:54.400 --> 25:59.480]  And for national gun confiscation, he ran the gun confiscation in Louisiana and Mississippi
[25:59.480 --> 26:00.480]  during Katrina.
[26:00.480 --> 26:03.040]  People thought I was joking a few months ago.
[26:03.040 --> 26:06.000]  Honore wrote the report that recommended what Congress did.
[26:06.000 --> 26:09.400]  They passed it, gave them $2 billion for additional security.
[26:09.400 --> 26:12.040]  They're opening offices up in all 50 states.
[26:12.040 --> 26:16.960]  Not just Florida and California.
[26:16.960 --> 26:17.960]  It's everywhere.
[26:17.960 --> 26:19.680]  And you're like, well, that's unconstitutional.
[26:19.680 --> 26:20.680]  That's crazy.
[26:20.680 --> 26:21.680]  It all is.
[26:21.680 --> 26:27.680]  Just like Biden saying, when I get elected, surge the border.
[26:27.680 --> 26:31.800]  And now for every ICE officer, there's a number out today.
[26:31.800 --> 26:35.520]  Every month on average, they make one arrest of a criminal inside the country that committed
[26:35.520 --> 26:36.520]  a crime.
[26:36.520 --> 26:37.520]  They don't make about one arrest a month.
[26:37.520 --> 26:39.440]  They used to make about one arrest a day.
[26:39.440 --> 26:44.360]  I've got the numbers right here, and it's just total flooding, total smuggling, total
[26:44.360 --> 26:53.320]  criminal activity, and a bunch of whacked-out, globalist, UN-loving generals strutting around
[26:53.320 --> 26:56.880]  talking about how we know the number one threat is white supremacist.
[26:56.880 --> 27:00.520]  That means anybody that's pro-American, anybody common sense, and we're ready for war with
[27:00.520 --> 27:05.480]  them, and we've got the military trained to take them on, and we're purging the military.
[27:05.480 --> 27:07.920]  They're not going to let us get to the midterms.
[27:07.920 --> 27:12.120]  How many months away from November of next year?
[27:12.120 --> 27:14.520]  Well, somebody do the math with the calendar for me.
[27:14.520 --> 27:15.520]  How many days?
[27:15.520 --> 27:20.680]  Let's have a countdown, because I told you they banned Trump by election on the Internet,
[27:20.680 --> 27:21.680]  which they did.
[27:21.680 --> 27:25.800]  I told you they stole the election and say it was a red mirage, but they won with mail-in
[27:25.800 --> 27:29.240]  ballots, because they said they were going to do it.
[27:29.240 --> 27:33.040]  They said all over the news, it'll be a red mirage, but we will not concede, and then
[27:33.040 --> 27:36.800]  the ballots will show that he won afterwards, and they just told you the official story
[27:36.800 --> 27:39.240]  and have been gaslighting you since before they did it.
[27:39.240 --> 27:42.880]  It doesn't matter we've got videos all over the country of them blacking out the windows
[27:42.880 --> 27:46.200]  and people video through a keyhole, and you see them pulling out the secret ballots and
[27:46.200 --> 27:49.320]  running them and looking over their shoulders, and then you get the ballots, and they are
[27:49.320 --> 27:51.040]  repeatedly counted all for Biden.
[27:51.040 --> 27:54.960]  We have them red-handed, and they've got U.S. generals saying, we're going to attack you
[27:54.960 --> 27:55.960]  with guns, buddy.
[27:55.960 --> 27:56.960]  You don't ask a question.
[27:56.960 --> 27:57.960]  We stole this country.
[27:57.960 --> 27:59.480]  You're a third-world nation now.
[27:59.480 --> 28:02.800]  Gerald in South Carolina, go ahead, you're on the air trying to move quicker.
[28:02.800 --> 28:03.800]  Hey, Alex.
[28:03.800 --> 28:04.800]  Welcome.
[28:04.800 --> 28:09.280]  First off, thanks for being the voice of reason and amongst all this stupidity.
[28:09.280 --> 28:12.400]  Wanted to warn people, I've been trying to get ahold of you for a year, okay?
[28:12.400 --> 28:19.120]  I'm a double amputee, and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away.
[28:19.120 --> 28:20.600]  Living defense saved my life.
[28:20.600 --> 28:24.920]  They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me.
[28:24.920 --> 28:26.360]  Living defense brought me back.
[28:26.360 --> 28:32.080]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible, Jesus is saying as to where we are right now.
[28:32.080 --> 28:38.880]  This is Matthew 24, verse 9, then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall
[28:38.880 --> 28:43.840]  kill you, and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.
[28:43.840 --> 28:49.160]  And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another.
[28:49.160 --> 28:50.960]  That's right where we're at, brother.
[28:50.960 --> 28:55.400]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country, no matter what they say,
[28:55.400 --> 28:58.760]  and that's why the enemy hates it, because God created this country.
[28:58.760 --> 29:03.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, Owen Schreuer here, the host of the Infowars War Room, and I am very
[29:03.320 --> 29:07.920]  excited about our latest supplement addition to InfowarsStore.com.
[29:07.920 --> 29:13.280]  Now, I've been supplementing with greens, fibers, and vegetable capsules for a long time,
[29:13.280 --> 29:18.880]  and so I was excited to hear that we were adding our own greens and fiber caps to InfowarsStore.com.
[29:18.880 --> 29:21.680]  But then I read the ingredients, and I was blown away.
[29:21.680 --> 29:23.240]  Listen to this.
[29:23.240 --> 29:28.720]  Organic pea fiber, organic alfalfa leaf, organic wheatgrass leaf, organic cilantro leaf, organic
[29:28.720 --> 29:34.720]  kale leaf, organic flax sprout, organic quinoa sprout, ladies and gentlemen, all of these
[29:34.720 --> 29:36.680]  things are so incredible for your health.
[29:36.680 --> 29:41.080]  Just one of these ingredients can be a life-changing supplement for your health, and we packed it
[29:41.080 --> 29:45.160]  all in to fibergreencaps at InfowarsStore.com.
[29:45.160 --> 29:48.920]  So I'm excited to add this to my supplement routine every day.
[29:48.920 --> 29:53.880]  I suggest that you do the same thing, and right now it's at an introductory price of
[29:53.880 --> 29:59.800]  $19.95 that's 33% off at InfowarsStore.com.
[29:59.800 --> 30:02.200]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point.
[30:02.200 --> 30:04.080]  It's very bittersweet.
[30:04.080 --> 30:07.280]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would, and now we have
[30:07.280 --> 30:08.280]  a lot of credibility.
[30:08.280 --> 30:09.280]  But I don't care about that.
[30:09.280 --> 30:10.680]  I care about beating the new world order.
[30:10.680 --> 30:15.840]  And it's because we have so much credibility, they can't allow us to stay on air much longer.
[30:15.840 --> 30:19.080]  And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us for a lot of reasons.
[30:19.080 --> 30:21.920]  I can't tell you what's going on, but let's just say this.
[30:21.920 --> 30:26.320]  We're going to see this through to the end, we're going to stay on air as long as we can.
[30:26.320 --> 30:29.960]  So please pray for us, and please buy the products at InfowarsStore.com.
[30:29.960 --> 30:32.520]  They're great products, plus they fund the operation.
[30:32.520 --> 30:35.400]  So you know, unlike other products you can buy, they're still great.
[30:35.400 --> 30:36.400]  Do they fund freedom?
[30:36.400 --> 30:37.720]  No, a lot of them don't.
[30:37.720 --> 30:42.400]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice when the whole world's waking
[30:42.400 --> 30:44.200]  up and looking for truth.
[30:44.200 --> 30:45.840]  That's why the globalists are censoring.
[30:45.840 --> 30:49.280]  They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us from the air.
[30:49.280 --> 30:52.760]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word.
[30:52.760 --> 30:56.200]  Download everything we've done you can find and save it, because who knows how long we're
[30:56.200 --> 31:03.360]  going to be on the air and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[31:03.360 --> 31:07.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[31:07.360 --> 31:22.800]  I've got a baby's brain and an old man's heart, 17 years to get this far.
[31:22.800 --> 31:32.480]  Don't always know what I'm talking about, feels like I'm living in a myth.
[31:32.480 --> 31:41.160]  We will take all the guns, that's the name of the video we posted three weeks ago, and
[31:41.160 --> 31:46.120]  it deals with just one of these globalist traders, Honore, who is running the plan for
[31:46.120 --> 31:51.680]  all the national offices of the Capitol Police and saying gun owners are terrorists, veterans
[31:51.680 --> 31:55.040]  are terrorists, anybody that doesn't want election fraud is a terrorist.
[31:55.040 --> 31:59.080]  If you question the election, you are a terrorist.
[31:59.080 --> 32:01.360]  Totally illegal to have the Pentagon look at the American people.
[32:01.360 --> 32:03.120]  Totally legal to have the CIA doing it.
[32:03.120 --> 32:09.000]  Totally legal to have the NSA spying, but now they've announced, oh, the DNC is already
[32:09.000 --> 32:12.600]  spying on all your text messages, but now they want to be able to control them and block
[32:12.600 --> 32:15.480]  them and tell you that they're reading them.
[32:15.480 --> 32:18.400]  That was announced a few days ago.
[32:18.400 --> 32:19.400]  We broke it here.
[32:19.400 --> 32:21.680]  I mean, it was buried in a Politico article, but they confirmed it.
[32:21.680 --> 32:25.320]  They said, yeah, of course we got to not let you send text messages we don't agree with.
[32:25.320 --> 32:30.840]  I mean, we're a dictatorship, complete with generals strutting around about how they're
[32:30.840 --> 32:35.160]  ready for a war with the American people.
[32:35.160 --> 32:38.400]  This is cancer.
[32:38.400 --> 32:39.480]  That's what this is.
[32:39.480 --> 32:41.200]  And now it's all over CNN.
[32:41.200 --> 32:43.080]  Trump was planning to be a dictator.
[32:43.080 --> 32:45.960]  Trump was planning to call it the military.
[32:45.960 --> 32:51.400]  I had Roger Stone on weeks before the election, and he said they're trying to get Trump around
[32:51.400 --> 32:55.360]  him to call for the insurrection act, and at that point they're going to have the Pentagon
[32:55.360 --> 32:59.960]  arrest him, even though it's not constitutional, and they were going to bring in a real dictatorship
[32:59.960 --> 33:01.680]  claiming Trump tried to become a dictator.
[33:01.680 --> 33:04.800]  Even though he had the right to do that, they were communist globalist agents.
[33:04.800 --> 33:05.800]  That was happening.
[33:05.800 --> 33:12.880]  But it was bad guys trying to set Trump up, and Trump figured it out and didn't do it.
[33:12.880 --> 33:17.080]  And that's why Trump is blocked everywhere now on the Internet.
[33:17.080 --> 33:21.240]  That's why his speeches can't get out, because that's a form of digital martial law.
[33:21.240 --> 33:22.680]  That's not dissentorship.
[33:22.680 --> 33:28.640]  We're already in deep stages of this, and that's why they're saying, oh, more lockdowns
[33:28.640 --> 33:29.640]  are coming.
[33:29.640 --> 33:32.160]  They're going to have an app on your phone to leave your house, and we'll tell you who
[33:32.160 --> 33:35.440]  can go and who can't.
[33:35.440 --> 33:39.240]  All seamlessly being rolled out.
[33:39.240 --> 33:42.760]  And now they're demonstrating all over the world against ongoing lockdowns, and you can't
[33:42.760 --> 33:46.800]  leave your house unless you've had an inoculation of an experimental deadly shot.
[33:46.800 --> 33:50.280]  I mean, the dystopia is here.
[33:50.280 --> 33:54.160]  And if you read the report put out a month ago by Joe Biden that he signed, his national
[33:54.160 --> 33:59.280]  directive on counterterrorism, they said we're not worried about the Russians, the Chinese,
[33:59.280 --> 34:03.960]  the Islamists, the Mexican mafia, we're worried about white supremacists.
[34:03.960 --> 34:06.160]  You're like, oh, I'm not a white supremacist.
[34:06.160 --> 34:12.800]  Oh, the definition of that is questions, elections, questions, lockdowns, questions, open borders,
[34:12.800 --> 34:15.200]  questions, gun control.
[34:15.200 --> 34:17.400]  Oh, they had a coup.
[34:17.400 --> 34:18.800]  They stole the election.
[34:18.800 --> 34:23.600]  They know there's going to be a giant landslide against that in the midterms.
[34:23.600 --> 34:26.480]  How many days already to the midterms guys that were looked at up?
[34:26.480 --> 34:28.360]  I'll do it.
[34:28.360 --> 34:32.400]  How many days to the midterm, so like 16 months.
[34:32.400 --> 34:38.520]  So how many days exactly because I want to, I want to start a countdown today.
[34:38.520 --> 34:43.960]  Countdown to, remember I told you the 79 days the hell from the time that they had election
[34:43.960 --> 34:48.240]  day to the time they steal it from Trump in America, that the hell that would unleash.
[34:48.240 --> 34:54.960]  And I was right because it's like counting down from one to, or up to one to 10.
[34:54.960 --> 34:58.480]  I mean, this is happening.
[34:58.480 --> 35:02.720]  It's like when a blue northern comes down in the spring and there's hot air with a hurricane.
[35:02.720 --> 35:05.520]  What's going to happen when a blue northern and a hurricane come together?
[35:05.520 --> 35:09.200]  Giant tornadoes.
[35:09.200 --> 35:25.440]  481 days until the official dictatorship of the left, one party dictatorship.
[35:25.440 --> 35:28.440]  They're giving me different numbers 493.
[35:28.440 --> 35:29.440]  We'll go over it.
[35:29.440 --> 35:30.440]  I'll double check it all.
[35:30.440 --> 35:32.440]  But the point is, that's what we're facing.
[35:32.440 --> 35:34.720]  That's what we're dealing with here.
[35:34.720 --> 35:41.640]  Again, it's like you go to the doctor and the doctor says, you have a cancer on your
[35:41.640 --> 35:44.840]  lymph node and it hasn't metastasized yet.
[35:44.840 --> 35:50.280]  We believe that we need to take it out today because it metastasized your dead.
[35:50.280 --> 35:51.280]  You go, I don't want to believe that.
[35:51.280 --> 35:52.280]  Sorry.
[35:52.280 --> 35:54.800]  You go off and leave and six months later, you're dead.
[35:54.800 --> 35:55.800]  It metastasizes.
[35:55.800 --> 35:59.400]  It sends out cancer spores all over your body.
[35:59.400 --> 36:00.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's already metastasized.
[36:00.400 --> 36:02.600]  Let me let's just be honest about that.
[36:02.600 --> 36:03.600]  Okay.
[36:03.600 --> 36:09.800]  We got cancer coming out of our ass here if you want to use that as an analogy.
[36:09.800 --> 36:13.920]  We are screwed.
[36:13.920 --> 36:16.200]  We got to continue our lives and our businesses.
[36:16.200 --> 36:17.760]  We've got to get the best positions we can.
[36:17.760 --> 36:18.760]  We can't just give up.
[36:18.760 --> 36:19.760]  They want us to.
[36:19.760 --> 36:20.760]  We've got to fight.
[36:20.760 --> 36:21.760]  We've got to expose them.
[36:21.760 --> 36:22.760]  We've got to do everything we can.
[36:22.760 --> 36:31.040]  But barring a huge awakening and people's own families taking things in their own hands.
[36:31.040 --> 36:34.880]  It should be the family members of all these globalist traders that are exposing them and
[36:34.880 --> 36:35.880]  outing them.
[36:35.880 --> 36:39.000]  And it's going to be whistleblowers and it's going to be live TV programs and it's going
[36:39.000 --> 36:44.120]  to be prayer and it's going to be governors and legislators waking up and mayors and other
[36:44.120 --> 36:48.600]  leaders organizing and focusing on this and coming out against the new world order or
[36:48.600 --> 36:53.480]  we have no hope because this is a takeover.
[36:53.480 --> 36:58.600]  Here's that piece on martial law and general honoring.
[36:58.600 --> 37:05.880]  This country and its 250 years history has never had traders as bad as Honor Ray and
[37:05.880 --> 37:07.480]  Millie in Austin.
[37:07.480 --> 37:13.400]  These men once they've been politically culturally economically and using the criminal justice
[37:13.400 --> 37:18.760]  system defeated will be known as the new definition of Benedict Arnold.
[37:18.760 --> 37:19.960]  They are the plague.
[37:19.960 --> 37:25.000]  They are a curse and they are planning in my view false flagged terror attacks here in
[37:25.000 --> 37:28.640]  America to submit their rollout against us.
[37:28.640 --> 37:29.840]  They're spoiling for a war.
[37:29.840 --> 37:31.600]  They're spoiling for a coup.
[37:31.600 --> 37:37.000]  They're spoiling to overthrow and they're getting ready to carry out terror attacks.
[37:37.000 --> 37:41.280]  That is their handlers are to be blamed on those of us that are loyal Americans in our
[37:41.280 --> 37:44.680]  opposition to the destruction of the country and the sellout of the nation and they're
[37:44.680 --> 37:49.480]  all over television saying Trump question the election is an act of terror and he's
[37:49.480 --> 37:53.360]  going to be dealt with by the military government's going to kill this guy and they're on channel
[37:53.360 --> 37:57.720]  saying we need to get members of Congress using the military people sitting in Congress
[37:57.720 --> 38:03.400]  right now people in and around the former president and then General Millie and General
[38:03.400 --> 38:08.520]  Austin and General Honor Ray get up there and click their heels and say we want to
[38:08.520 --> 38:13.960]  slug out with the American people and every white person that doesn't salute us is a white
[38:13.960 --> 38:25.040]  supremacist enemy and we're the Americans and they're Hitler and we're going to get
[38:25.040 --> 38:45.680]  this to America says Millie death to America says Austin death to America says on array
[38:45.680 --> 38:51.840]  to chronicle the treason in anti-American activities of General Honor Ray Austin and
[38:51.840 --> 38:59.280]  Millie it would take years let us examine only one small data point the gun confiscation
[38:59.280 --> 39:06.080]  that took place after the Katrina hurricane where peaceful people high and dry under the
[39:06.080 --> 39:12.520]  orders of Honor Ray had their firearms stolen and taken from them never to be returned the
[39:12.520 --> 39:19.520]  police and National Guard going street by street house to house sometimes entering open houses
[39:19.520 --> 39:26.360]  with guns drawn instructions to disarm anyone inside you say guns guns will be taken no
[39:26.360 --> 39:31.480]  one will be able to be on yes take all weapons and now on array is organizing the national
[39:31.480 --> 39:38.280]  response for the Democratic Party for gun confiscation that happened today in this wealthy neighborhood
[39:38.280 --> 39:44.120]  where homeowners had armed themselves to protect their mansions residents were handcuffed
[39:44.120 --> 39:49.160]  on the ground in the end police took their weapons but let them stay in their homes for
[39:49.160 --> 39:53.400]  many of the police and guard troops it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American
[39:53.400 --> 40:00.400]  city this guard unit occupied a church using it as a base camp all of a sudden they were
[40:00.400 --> 40:09.680]  banging on the front door the side door and the back door and they let us in I say that
[40:09.680 --> 40:16.200]  sound even loaded I really thought they were going to kill me they took them and they didn't
[40:16.200 --> 40:19.880]  have a right to take them they didn't have a reason to take you never expect to do this
[40:19.880 --> 40:24.960]  in your own country Chris Montgomery says he'd rather be in Iraq than patrolling American
[40:24.960 --> 40:29.440]  neighborhoods walking up and down these streets you don't you don't want to think about the
[40:29.440 --> 40:34.960]  stuff that you're gonna have to do somebody pops around the corner and be shooting America

[46:22.440 --> 46:28.400]  we're so decentralized they don't have control here yet they need us to adopt the iPhone
[46:28.400 --> 46:33.400]  or droid app that is the world ID that is in a social credit score that if you don't
[46:33.400 --> 46:39.040]  behave and do what they say they will then deactivate or remove some of your quote privileges
[46:39.040 --> 46:45.080]  and that's all in the news today but we're in a race the people we thought were good
[46:45.080 --> 46:49.640]  like Boris Johnson turned out to be a traitor and good people like Bolsonaro and people
[46:49.640 --> 46:55.880]  who overall went meant well like President Trump saying no to the globalist calling
[46:55.880 --> 47:02.760]  the shots and so now video Tucker Carlson shows evidence of flat out criminal fraud
[47:02.760 --> 47:09.320]  close quote in Georgia during 2020 election and when you look at the findings of tens
[47:09.320 --> 47:15.640]  of thousands of ballots hundreds and hundreds of different drop boxes all of them ladies
[47:15.640 --> 47:24.920]  and gentlemen hundred percent ballots for Joe Biden and in other cases the vast majority
[47:24.920 --> 47:32.240]  for Joe Biden Georgia vote audit shows 100% of absentee ballots came in for Biden in thousands
[47:32.240 --> 47:39.680]  of drop boxes new evidence reveals Georgia audit fraud and massive errors stunning new
[47:39.680 --> 47:45.800]  evidence shows audit tally sheets marked 100% for Biden but then when you go into the ballot
[47:45.800 --> 47:54.480]  boxes they're not for Biden organized criminal fraud meanwhile Arizona Senate to hold hearing
[47:54.480 --> 47:59.240]  today at 10am on Arizona election fraud could come out as early as today or tomorrow they're
[47:59.240 --> 48:06.600]  finding the exact same thing so what is the deep state going to do we'll talk about that
[48:06.600 --> 48:10.360]  next hour but they're going to strike back they're never going to let us get to that
[48:10.360 --> 48:14.720]  midterm without a fight we can expose what they're doing what they're prepping we can
[48:14.720 --> 48:21.240]  catch them in the act we can stop them but everybody better get off the fence here we're
[48:21.240 --> 48:27.280]  going to lose everything if we don't stop this globalist takeover let's go ahead and
[48:27.280 --> 48:33.600]  go to part of Tucker Carlson's groundbreaking research and report last night house except
[48:33.600 --> 48:39.640]  it's not true it now appears there actually was meaningful voter fraud in Fulton County
[48:39.640 --> 48:44.800]  Georgia last November that is not a conspiracy theory it's true from the beginning this show
[48:44.800 --> 48:49.640]  has tried to be fact-based when we talk about the 2020 election results so here's what we
[48:49.640 --> 48:55.040]  know tonight factually at least 36 batches of mail-in ballots from the November election
[48:55.040 --> 49:00.200]  were double counted in Fulton County that's a total of more than 4,000 votes those numbers
[49:00.200 --> 49:05.720]  come from a group called voter GA which along with Bob Chile sued to get them the final
[49:05.720 --> 49:11.400]  tally from the double counts we know about amounts to more than 3,300 votes for Joe Biden
[49:11.400 --> 49:18.360]  and 865 votes for Donald Trump now before you dismiss Bob Chile and voter GA as dishonest
[49:18.360 --> 49:23.640]  partisan actors keep in mind that the strongly leftist center Atlanta Journal Constitution
[49:23.640 --> 49:28.760]  appears to agree with this at least an outline the newspaper reviewed the available digital
[49:28.760 --> 49:34.640]  ballot images independently and concluded that hundreds of ballots were improperly duplicated
[49:34.640 --> 49:39.760]  what does that look like exactly well here's what it looks like at a press conference yesterday
[49:39.760 --> 49:44.320]  a consultant with voter GA called David Cross showed how we can be certain that votes in
[49:44.320 --> 49:53.240]  Fulton County were counted more than once watch what I'm going to show you here is two ballots
[49:53.240 --> 49:58.600]  side by side one of them is marked for Jason Shaw and it's a little squibble mark next
[49:58.600 --> 50:06.040]  to it you can see it's got the identical mark on the second one and the ballot image is stored
[50:06.040 --> 50:13.680]  up here on the top left so this one over here is scanner 5162 that's scanner number three
[50:13.680 --> 50:24.160]  that's number 235 image number 19 and that matches 234 image 59 so you have the same
[50:24.160 --> 50:33.840]  ballot counted twice in the images and counted in the audience how that's possible I don't
[50:33.840 --> 50:41.600]  know how's that possible I don't know every American should want to know because the answer
[50:41.600 --> 50:46.600]  gets to the heart of the integrity of our elections otherwise known as our democracy
[50:46.600 --> 50:51.800]  we're not talking about a couple of ballots here we're talking about a lot of ballots
[50:51.800 --> 50:58.600]  at least hundreds of ballots involved enough potentially to affect the outcome of the election
[50:58.600 --> 51:27.080]  here's another example so what's the explanation for this well if you ask Fulton County these
[51:27.080 --> 51:30.720]  discrepancies the ones you just saw on the screen were isolated incidents just a handful
[51:30.720 --> 51:35.640]  of bad ballots happens all the time the county claims that any errors were caught in previous
[51:35.640 --> 51:40.360]  recounts the problem is that neither one of those claims is true surveillance footage
[51:40.360 --> 51:45.000]  obtained by voter GA appears to show large numbers of ballots being scanned multiple
[51:45.000 --> 51:49.960]  times pay attention the tape we're showing you to the woman wearing yellow at the desk
[51:49.960 --> 51:54.720]  according to voter GA she slides ballots into a scanning machine removes the ballots and
[51:54.720 --> 52:00.360]  then reinserts the same ballots this happens multiple times the question is how many times
[52:00.360 --> 52:05.400]  were those ballots counted with each vote counted more than once Fulton County won't
[52:05.400 --> 52:09.960]  answer that question now one way to know the answer would be to check what are called audit
[52:09.960 --> 52:15.200]  tally sheets telling me for months after the presidential election Fulton County failed
[52:15.200 --> 52:19.680]  to provide more than a hundred thousand of those tally sheets including fifty thousand
[52:19.680 --> 52:24.720]  of them for mail-in ballots when voter GA finally forced Fulton County to turn over
[52:24.720 --> 52:32.160]  the tally sheets the conclusion was stunning here's what the audit found quote seven falsified
[52:32.160 --> 52:37.120]  audit tally sheets containing fabricated vote totals for example a batch containing fifty
[52:37.120 --> 52:42.680]  nine actual ballot images for Joe Biden and forty two for Donald Trump was reported as
[52:42.680 --> 52:48.440]  a hundred for Biden and zero for Trump the seven batches of ballot images with five hundred
[52:48.440 --> 52:52.680]  and fifty four votes for Joe Biden hundred and forty votes for Donald Trump and eleven
[52:52.680 --> 52:57.880]  votes for Joe Jorgensen had tally sheets in the audit falsified to show eight hundred
[52:57.880 --> 53:04.720]  and fifty votes for Biden zero votes for Trump and zero votes for Jorgensen wait did you
[53:04.720 --> 53:09.560]  just follow that how is that not flat out criminal fraud we'd love to know because it
[53:09.560 --> 53:15.560]  certainly sounds like flat out criminal fraud we've obtained photographs showing went on
[53:15.560 --> 53:20.000]  during the recount process for mail-in ballots at Fulton County these pictures were taken
[53:20.000 --> 53:24.080]  by a whistleblower who participated in the recount she said she noticed something odd
[53:24.080 --> 53:28.760]  as she did none of the ballots that she saw had any creases on them you can see the stacks
[53:28.760 --> 53:33.280]  of unfolded ballots on your screen now that's strange because of course mail-in ballots
[53:33.280 --> 53:39.200]  need to be bent in order to be mailed in these ballots clearly had never been inside an envelope
[53:39.200 --> 53:42.960]  and then the whistleblower noticed something else all of the ballots the whistleblower
[53:42.960 --> 53:48.080]  tells us have been filled out by a printer not by hand and many of them supported the
[53:48.080 --> 53:54.040]  exact same candidates Democrats including Joe Biden voter GA detected a series of other
[53:54.040 --> 53:58.760]  apparent irregularities in the recount the group's audit found for example that quote
[53:58.760 --> 54:03.400]  over two hundred Fulton County all right and this goes on for like 20 minutes the full
[54:03.400 --> 54:07.080]  videos that info wars dot com and news wars dot com I suggest you go get it I suggest
[54:07.080 --> 54:11.480]  you share it now remember the Pentagon says they're involved with what Americans can do
[54:11.480 --> 54:16.320]  now and they actually say you're a terrorist if you do seriously that's official and they've
[54:16.320 --> 54:19.880]  announced they're reading your text messages so you better get scared of the Secretary
[54:19.880 --> 54:23.520]  of Defense and scared of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and do what they say
[54:23.520 --> 54:28.080]  now I got a better idea you need to go to present Millie and so do you Austin and Joe
[54:28.080 --> 54:34.080]  Biden these people have announced Soviet level North Korea level crap and are trying to implement
[54:34.080 --> 54:38.840]  it and if we're such great tough Americans land of the free home of the brave we can
[54:38.840 --> 54:43.560]  at least get to our legislatures our cities and demand they take action and organize against
[54:43.560 --> 54:49.760]  these damn criminals because right now they're just green lit to do whatever they want the
[54:49.760 --> 54:54.760]  federal government under Biden is funding convicted pedophiles to go into public schools
[54:54.760 --> 55:00.760]  everywhere dressed up as clowns but that sounds insane it all is insane they're smuggling
[55:00.760 --> 55:05.680]  children that one church we documented in mcallin now released official numbers this
[55:05.680 --> 55:12.120]  week 6,000 plus children a week being run through that one facility and there's no background
[55:12.120 --> 55:17.440]  checks no nothing another FBI article right here where the FBI knew about pedophile rings
[55:17.440 --> 55:23.680]  and 70 girls raped and protected the man that raped 70 girls that's next hour I mean the
[55:23.680 --> 55:30.600]  government is just criminal filth scum at the top I mean they are just lawless demons
[55:30.600 --> 55:33.720]  and everybody else is just scared of them and backing down to them and just kissing
[55:33.720 --> 55:37.680]  their ass all day long we're not we're not backing down so tell everybody you know tune

[57:06.480 --> 57:12.120]  like me I was loaded up with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called but since
[57:12.120 --> 57:17.640]  taking your x2 for the last couple of years my skin is just really gorgeous actually people
[57:17.640 --> 57:23.600]  think I'm fifty five years old and I was already taking your other supplements but I thought
[57:23.600 --> 57:27.480]  you know well maybe that's what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless
[57:27.480 --> 57:32.440]  situation but when I started taking it it doesn't happen immediately but you know over
[57:32.440 --> 57:38.120]  a period of time I started noticing okay you know this is a ticket this is working this
[57:38.120 --> 57:43.960]  is wonderful you know I don't I don't have to put it on derma blend anymore you know so
[57:43.960 --> 57:53.560]  anyway it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin you're listening
[57:53.560 --> 58:20.040]  to the Alex Jones show live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide I'm going to hit the
[58:20.040 --> 58:26.840]  international news tied together to the great reset coming up next segment we got Dan Lyman
[58:26.840 --> 58:32.400]  who's the head of Europe wars dot com great reporter for us he'll be in studio a little
[58:32.400 --> 58:40.520]  bit the next hour I want the phones up in the third hour today as well but I tell you
[58:40.520 --> 58:48.040]  I mean it is it is just amazing to it is amazing to be in this time it is amazing to basically
[58:48.040 --> 58:54.880]  be in this position I am very blessed and honored to still be on air and I've always
[58:54.880 --> 59:01.200]  had a sense of urgency about the project for a new world order for world government because
[59:01.200 --> 59:06.000]  I knew it was a real project run by very very real people who are extremely ruthless and
[59:06.000 --> 59:12.140]  evil and the world they said they were going to build was so dystopic I knew I had a responsibility
[59:12.140 --> 59:17.320]  to oppose it but if it wasn't for all of you spreading the word and supporting us over
[59:17.320 --> 59:21.480]  the years we couldn't have done this when I say we that isn't a pat on the head I'm
[59:21.480 --> 59:28.640]  not patronizing you when you figure out the fact that you are everything in this fight
[59:28.640 --> 59:33.080]  we start winning when you're engaged when you're taking action when you're paying attention
[59:33.080 --> 59:40.080]  when you're praying to God we're unstoppable together so I just want everybody to take
[59:40.080 --> 59:45.640]  a moment take a deep breath like I'm trying to do and understand that at least we were
[59:45.640 --> 59:49.960]  aware of this coming and we prepared and we warned people so that now that it's coming
[59:49.960 --> 59:54.480]  through our credibility is going up so more people are listening and so we have a good
[59:54.480 --> 59:59.280]  chance of defeating it and opposition to globalism is becoming main line because you have the
[59:59.280 --> 1:00:04.840]  New York Times saying globalism doesn't exist anybody says it they're evil and horrible
[1:00:04.840 --> 1:00:08.560]  anybody that says there's election fraud they're evil and horrible arrest them use the Pentagon
[1:00:08.560 --> 1:00:12.560]  on them and we're going to read all your text messages we're the one party dictatorship
[1:00:12.560 --> 1:00:18.360]  the DNC imagine if the Republicans said we're going to read all your text messages it's
[1:00:18.360 --> 1:00:26.200]  just they've gone over the edge they're they're complete maniacs and so we just got to be nonviolent
[1:00:26.200 --> 1:00:32.880]  speak out non-compliant expose them and point out they're not American that they are usurping
[1:00:32.880 --> 1:00:36.720]  us and I believe we've got a good chance of defeating this but they're going to stage
[1:00:36.720 --> 1:00:40.240]  events to demonize us even though we're not going to be violent so we got to be ready
[1:00:40.240 --> 1:00:45.320]  to expose that we've got to be speaking out about that right now so that when they do
[1:00:45.320 --> 1:00:49.840]  pull their false flag that only wakes people up faster and so more whistleblowers go public
[1:00:49.840 --> 1:00:54.840]  their own family members go public and the Lord works in mysterious ways and will frustrate
[1:00:54.840 --> 1:00:59.360]  their plans and they will be defeated but now is the time to be praying also spreading
[1:00:59.360 --> 1:01:04.440]  the word about the broadcast and finally you need to understand that we have products that
[1:01:04.440 --> 1:01:10.040]  are absolutely essential for you and your family I can go out and get you a synthetic
[1:01:10.040 --> 1:01:15.600]  multivitamin that a whole bottle of it cost me $5 that I could then sell for 1995 but
[1:01:15.600 --> 1:01:21.560]  no the stuff we get costs way more than that just the ingredients alone in DNA force plus
[1:01:21.560 --> 1:01:28.760]  is 40 something bucks it's insane so some of our products are low cost because we can
[1:01:28.760 --> 1:01:32.720]  get high quality stuff at a low cost but some of the things have a higher cost because they've
[1:01:32.720 --> 1:01:37.400]  got top of the line ingredients in them take our greens fiber capsules with all the amino
[1:01:37.400 --> 1:01:42.920]  acids and a bunch of key vitamins and minerals it's a high end product for $10 what a similar
[1:01:42.920 --> 1:01:48.360]  product is sold for in places like Whole Foods fiber greens with all the amino acids and
[1:01:48.360 --> 1:01:58.720]  more 1995 and I could have put created a formula for a fraction of the cost of what it takes
[1:01:58.720 --> 1:02:01.920]  for us to put this together it's still on an expensive formula for us to put together
[1:02:01.920 --> 1:02:06.200]  but the average company puts a five to six times markup on their products we don't do

[1:05:26.160 --> 1:05:32.600]  Korea and Biden has come out and said Cuba is good black lives matter has said they defend
[1:05:32.600 --> 1:05:42.400]  the communist dictatorship sake has come out and said they've done nothing wrong it tells
[1:05:42.400 --> 1:05:54.280]  you everything you need to know about these people the globalist are bad bad bad the
[1:05:54.280 --> 1:06:03.040]  average Cuban might be able to take their family out to eat once every three months
[1:06:03.040 --> 1:06:08.440]  you might have to make a tube of toothpaste that's a real photo by the way of sake last
[1:06:08.440 --> 1:06:17.880]  a year a bottle of aspirin cost 30 to $40 because communism can't and won't produce anything
[1:06:17.880 --> 1:06:25.400]  because it's a system of slavery by a ruling class not of the people and now we have the
[1:06:25.400 --> 1:06:31.760]  headline info wars dot com it's it's conclusive out of Georgia we have the videos of them
[1:06:31.760 --> 1:06:41.120]  in Atlanta shutting it saying there's a water main burst that didn't happen water main break
[1:06:41.120 --> 1:06:46.320]  they look around both sides knowing their own camera pull out the suitcases and then run
[1:06:46.320 --> 1:06:53.800]  the ballots in one video eight times the same ballots because they're all for Biden and
[1:06:53.800 --> 1:06:57.880]  then even though big stacks of ballots came in that were for Trump they would falsify the
[1:06:57.880 --> 1:07:08.600]  top document we don't have those and say 100% 100% for Biden out of thousands of ballots
[1:07:08.600 --> 1:07:18.480]  not only lost by 13,000 votes similar things happened in all the other states and it's
[1:07:18.480 --> 1:07:26.040]  all on video because the people doing it were too lazy or too busy I guess trying to still
[1:07:26.040 --> 1:07:32.400]  have an election because it was such a land slide for Trump that they wouldn't even go
[1:07:32.400 --> 1:07:37.320]  over to a box and act like it was a new stat they just run a hundred ballots in the machine
[1:07:37.320 --> 1:07:43.720]  run it again run it again run it again run it again run it again run it again run it
[1:07:43.720 --> 1:07:48.480]  again and they had big stacks of mall crisp and perfect right out of the box is printed
[1:07:48.480 --> 1:07:56.160]  in China flown in on private jets now all come out Michigan Georgia everywhere and even
[1:07:56.160 --> 1:08:00.760]  when postal workers said I'm driving cross state lines with ballots I'm driving out of
[1:08:00.760 --> 1:08:04.960]  one state the Pennsylvania and it's a whole truckload of these let me see what they're
[1:08:04.960 --> 1:08:13.120]  all marked for Joe Biden and why do you think in Pennsylvania and in Michigan in places
[1:08:13.120 --> 1:08:18.640]  they didn't steal it from local Republicans the ballots the scantron ones that were already
[1:08:18.640 --> 1:08:24.640]  been filled up on machine they found in multiple states were just for Senate races and presidential
[1:08:24.640 --> 1:08:29.320]  because they made deals with the Republican Party not to steal it from them in general
[1:08:29.320 --> 1:08:38.040]  if they went along see how it works and the FBI came to the house of that postal worker
[1:08:38.040 --> 1:08:48.880]  and they said we might indict you for looking at what was in the mail he's like why am I
[1:08:48.880 --> 1:08:52.840]  driving across state lines with Pennsylvania ballots out of another state this obviously
[1:08:52.840 --> 1:08:57.640]  didn't come out of Pennsylvania he goes I'm gonna open these sons of bitches up this is
[1:08:57.640 --> 1:09:03.520]  a good American and he opened them up and they were all for Joe Biden total proof of
[1:09:03.520 --> 1:09:08.560]  fraud so he goes to the authorities and they send the FBI and threatening he still had
[1:09:08.560 --> 1:09:14.640]  the courage to go on TV but Fox News wouldn't pick it up he was on local news and on conservative
[1:09:14.640 --> 1:09:21.320]  news on interviews that was it a postal worker with the vehicle with 30 something thousand
[1:09:21.320 --> 1:09:25.920]  ballots all for Joe Biden that were delivered and that were stuck in machines to steal that
[1:09:25.920 --> 1:09:40.320]  damn state we caught them red handed over and over and over again and what do we get
[1:09:40.320 --> 1:09:46.320]  we get to be lectured by the military and new announcements that we're the enemy and
[1:09:46.320 --> 1:09:52.480]  the military is ready for war with us we are so pathetic if we let these people intimidate
[1:09:52.480 --> 1:10:00.040]  us and we will go into generations of bondage at the hands of people like on array and Austin
[1:10:00.040 --> 1:10:06.440]  and Millie and it'll be just like it is in every dictatorship it'll be their grandchildren
[1:10:06.440 --> 1:10:19.480]  ruling over us standing up there with a bunch of ten stars on their lapel strutting around
[1:10:19.480 --> 1:10:27.240]  and then they run around and try to intimidate us to shut our mouths well we're about to
[1:10:27.240 --> 1:10:31.160]  lose the very foundation of this country we're about to go into total slavery and let me
[1:10:31.160 --> 1:10:36.560]  show you this next disgusting piece of news Don Salazar has been here many years I don't
[1:10:36.560 --> 1:10:44.000]  know seven eight years great writer great guy and I noticed he was suspended on Twitter
[1:10:44.000 --> 1:10:47.440]  and I said why are you suspended last night we were talking on the phone he said let me
[1:10:47.440 --> 1:10:55.520]  send you a screenshot I linked to local news into the Facebook of the family whose a forty
[1:10:55.520 --> 1:11:02.480]  five year old mother she's a mother was hired at John Hopkins and she had to take the vaccine
[1:11:02.480 --> 1:11:08.880]  and the vaccine killed her they think it's her family them talking about it now she died
[1:11:08.880 --> 1:11:13.480]  uh liquefied her organs and she's dead and that's her Instagram and Facebook and we showed
[1:11:13.480 --> 1:11:20.000]  it and guess what old Twitter did the old Don Salazar huh you dirty American shut your
[1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:27.200]  mouth we think this is America this is Cuba they said your story is fake information about
[1:11:27.200 --> 1:11:33.440]  COVID-19 and what is the story it's a true story about a woman that died after she took
[1:11:33.440 --> 1:11:37.360]  the shot and the doctors even said it was a complication but they don't care they're
[1:11:37.360 --> 1:11:42.920]  not going to let you be warned that people are dying and they do this all over the place
[1:11:42.920 --> 1:11:49.040]  how many other people you think got sick or died that you never heard about well the numbers
[1:11:49.040 --> 1:11:53.280]  are big Hank Aaron's family said he didn't have an autopsy and a shot killed him so they
[1:11:53.280 --> 1:11:58.960]  suppressed that same thing with MDX same thing with everybody this is what the criminals
[1:11:58.960 --> 1:12:04.240]  at Twitter and Facebook and YouTube are aiding and abetting murder and and and covering up
[1:12:04.240 --> 1:12:09.360]  a woman that's dead she wanted to work at John Hopkins she took the shot now she dead at
[1:12:09.360 --> 1:12:16.960]  John Hopkins and there they are information management making sure that oh no you don't
[1:12:16.960 --> 1:12:21.160]  write about that you don't let people know she died because we're going to make sure
[1:12:21.160 --> 1:12:24.160]  more people take it and die and we're going to gas fly everybody we're going to cover
[1:12:24.160 --> 1:12:28.800]  that up so it's kind of like Bill Marx said a few weeks ago he said you know it's one
[1:12:28.800 --> 1:12:34.320]  thing to censor Republicans he was saying well ivermectin's not a Republican what are
[1:12:34.320 --> 1:12:38.840]  you doing censoring ivermectin it's a drug I deserve to know no see you don't deserve
[1:12:38.840 --> 1:12:43.560]  to know because this is big pharma that's merged with big tech and this is what they're
[1:12:43.560 --> 1:12:48.520]  going to do they suppress treatments that will save millions they lied about the numbers
[1:12:48.520 --> 1:12:55.880]  that it's a criminal takeover and so all of you that work at big tech and censor with
[1:12:55.880 --> 1:13:01.240]  the AI you'll be replaced with AI completely soon boy I got a hand to two you're really
[1:13:01.240 --> 1:13:07.520]  gangsters now I mean you don't like kill rival gang members that are men and have guns you're
[1:13:07.520 --> 1:13:12.080]  worse than them you actually kill little kids and women and old people and you cover it up
[1:13:12.080 --> 1:13:16.520]  because when you aid the bed and you cover up people that have died and their families
[1:13:16.520 --> 1:13:23.640]  talking about how their daughter died when you do that you're now an accomplice to murder
[1:13:23.640 --> 1:13:29.640]  hope that feels good and I hope you feel safe not for me I mean in a world where no one's
[1:13:29.640 --> 1:13:34.680]  going to be able to stand up for you either you'll be silenced when they come for you
[1:13:34.680 --> 1:13:41.000]  you see because you reap what you sow you fools shame on you oh but I know I'm the bad
[1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:47.080]  Alex Jones I questioned public events and most of the time they've been fake oh I get
[1:13:47.080 --> 1:13:52.960]  it I didn't lie about WMD's I didn't do no no but I get it I get it you're the liberals
[1:13:52.960 --> 1:14:00.200]  you're allowed to cover up the deaths I understand humanity has been domesticated by and large
[1:14:00.200 --> 1:14:04.760]  the population has been trained to submit do what you're told it's all going to pass
[1:14:04.760 --> 1:14:08.680]  but if you study authoritarians if you study the globalist you understand that they reach
[1:14:08.680 --> 1:14:12.840]  a point where all the training is just beta and you go into the point of being cold being
[1:14:12.840 --> 1:14:16.960]  totally enslaved and because the globalists see us as weak and see us as stupid they
[1:14:16.960 --> 1:14:21.640]  are now making that move and they are collapsing the third world with their economic weapons
[1:14:21.640 --> 1:14:27.040]  to then flood us with the third world that the UN will use as a weapon to then have us
[1:14:27.040 --> 1:14:32.120]  under such a crisis under such a load capitulate to the UN whatever agreements they want us
[1:14:32.120 --> 1:14:37.440]  to sign hoping that they will stop the flood of tens of millions of refugees not fleeing
[1:14:37.440 --> 1:14:42.640]  COVID or climate change as the UN and Klaus Schwabber saying and Bill Gates is saying
[1:14:42.640 --> 1:14:49.000]  but fleeing the year long lockdowns that the UN and Bill Gates ordered them to institute
[1:14:49.000 --> 1:14:54.600]  or they wouldn't get more IMF and World Bank money and that's why we have to really get
[1:14:54.600 --> 1:15:02.800]  educated about the globalist what are champions made of here's a man who can show you
[1:15:54.600 --> 1:16:20.000]  your listening to the Alex Jones show Tucker Carlson is a crazy person welcome back to
[1:16:20.000 --> 1:16:24.960]  the Alex Jones show we're told that Carlson is crazy that a whistleblower gave him documents
[1:16:24.960 --> 1:16:28.360]  with a whole bunch of his text messages to hundreds of people to let him know that he
[1:16:28.360 --> 1:16:33.400]  was being spied on of course he is it came out that I was spied on Roger Stone anybody
[1:16:33.400 --> 1:16:38.480]  of note is being spied on everybody's being collected but then the Democrats came out
[1:16:38.480 --> 1:16:43.320]  this week and they said oh we want to spy on all your text messages with the telecoms
[1:16:43.320 --> 1:16:50.480]  and monitor them of your question the election or anti-COVID news to save your life so the
[1:16:50.480 --> 1:16:55.320]  Democratic Party wants to set the parameters to read your text messages but Tucker Carlson
[1:16:55.320 --> 1:17:00.080]  is crazy nobody's nobody's spying on him Dan Lyman is right the shotgun with us into
[1:17:00.080 --> 1:17:04.720]  the next hour we're going to put the phones up as well next hour and Dan Lyman writes
[1:17:04.720 --> 1:17:08.960]  for Europe Wars.com he's the head of that sort of info wars for many years he's also
[1:17:08.960 --> 1:17:12.880]  run some other great sites as well Dan Lyman is American writer political activist a cultural
[1:17:12.880 --> 1:17:16.920]  commentator and for years of fronting a major rock man and answering the call the truth
[1:17:16.920 --> 1:17:22.360]  journalism to defense of western civilization Dan now serves the foreign correspondent
[1:17:22.360 --> 1:17:26.120]  for info wars and you have some other great sites you run separately we want you to talk
[1:17:26.120 --> 1:17:30.200]  about but we were talking about big picture you wanted to get into big picture first the
[1:17:30.200 --> 1:17:33.880]  globalist in your words have a lot of momentum they smell blood in the water those are your
[1:17:33.880 --> 1:17:40.920]  words I agree I've really just being honest with the audience I'm I mean before if I had
[1:17:40.920 --> 1:17:44.960]  real real concerns like a three or four this is about a nine right now I mean I'm I told
[1:17:44.960 --> 1:17:49.280]  my wife this morning I said this is this is serious we've got to get ready ourselves
[1:17:49.280 --> 1:17:52.760]  they're going to just keep collapsing things here on out unless we have a total awakening
[1:17:52.760 --> 1:17:57.160]  and and we get leaders that resist this your view on where the world is right now Dan Lyman
[1:17:57.160 --> 1:18:00.880]  good to have you back in Texas good to be back with you always you know it's interesting
[1:18:00.880 --> 1:18:05.720]  to me to be back in the US for the first time in a while now and it's been refreshing to
[1:18:05.720 --> 1:18:09.280]  at least not have to wear a mask in certain places and public spots and restaurants and
[1:18:09.280 --> 1:18:14.800]  stores and stuff because basically in all of Europe that is still all in place and it's
[1:18:14.800 --> 1:18:19.720]  really shocking to me that there's only basically a few US states basically that have gone down
[1:18:19.720 --> 1:18:23.880]  this path you know and people like DeSantis have led the way and we've had some other
[1:18:23.880 --> 1:18:27.560]  states follow suit and kind of throwing the mask mandates out the window but basically
[1:18:27.560 --> 1:18:31.120]  everywhere else in the world that this still under this insane tyranny and I think that
[1:18:31.120 --> 1:18:36.560]  that is really emblematic of where we're at right now globally is that you know people
[1:18:36.560 --> 1:18:41.320]  are still basically living under martial law at this point across the planet and that's
[1:18:41.320 --> 1:18:45.240]  not changing it's been 18 months of this and people are not pushing back on it we're starting
[1:18:45.240 --> 1:18:49.200]  to see a little bit in France now but that's because France has started to escalate the
[1:18:49.200 --> 1:18:53.960]  situation and they're moving on to the next phase where for circulation exactly and expanding
[1:18:53.960 --> 1:18:59.000]  on that cloud swab is all of TV saying this never ends you don't see it's the cut is deep
[1:18:59.000 --> 1:19:03.840]  we save earth from carbon it's good right you know 18 months ago we're warning that
[1:19:03.840 --> 1:19:08.160]  this was all never going to end and that they were going to move towards forced inoculations
[1:19:08.160 --> 1:19:13.640]  and vaccine passports and people say we were crazy and now they've gone from saying that
[1:19:13.640 --> 1:19:17.000]  would never be the case saying there will be no vaccine passports and now saying yes
[1:19:17.000 --> 1:19:21.920]  they will be and here's why they're good so the gas lighting has really increased and
[1:19:21.920 --> 1:19:24.920]  people are still falling for it which is really incredible to me.
[1:19:24.920 --> 1:19:28.800]  Well because people are sheep like and they really think the system cares about them they're
[1:19:28.800 --> 1:19:32.760]  in a trance but they're going to find out very quickly as they lose their resources
[1:19:32.760 --> 1:19:36.120]  and things fall apart that's not the case but by then the secret police are on every
[1:19:36.120 --> 1:19:38.840]  corner by then we're in North Korea or Cuba.
[1:19:38.840 --> 1:19:41.960]  Right and you know we've had this defund the police movement for a couple years now we
[1:19:41.960 --> 1:19:45.720]  know basically what they're doing is they're trying to run out all the decent people that
[1:19:45.720 --> 1:19:49.520]  would be in law enforcement and they've been very successful and that you have record
[1:19:49.520 --> 1:19:50.840]  retirements across.
[1:19:50.840 --> 1:19:54.000]  That's why they tell the army and I found out from a green beret I know that's forced
[1:19:54.000 --> 1:19:59.440]  to training they make them wear red high heels not just regular army now and march around
[1:19:59.440 --> 1:20:03.400]  and say communist stuff which again is meant to drive the good people out but the good
[1:20:03.400 --> 1:20:08.400]  word is they're all just ignoring it and just laughing about it so overall the military
[1:20:08.400 --> 1:20:09.400]  gets it.
[1:20:09.400 --> 1:20:13.920]  That's good to hear I think that they're trying to insert as many SJWs and compliant
[1:20:13.920 --> 1:20:18.160]  people into law enforcement and the military so that they can continue to ratchet up this
[1:20:18.160 --> 1:20:19.160]  agenda.
[1:20:19.160 --> 1:20:22.600]  Well that said at this point America is occupied so of course they're going to litmus test
[1:20:22.600 --> 1:20:27.640]  to make you get out what people need to do in my view is be honest about that spread
[1:20:27.640 --> 1:20:30.440]  the word you have the right of free speech to explain what's happening big picture to
[1:20:30.440 --> 1:20:34.320]  people whether you're enlisted or you know commissioned or non-commissioned people have
[1:20:34.320 --> 1:20:39.600]  to explain what's happening and then explain this is an occupied military we actually need
[1:20:39.600 --> 1:20:43.760]  to stay in here and not let them kick us out and I'm not trying to tell people hey you
[1:20:43.760 --> 1:20:47.920]  better stay that's an order I'm just saying if I was in this was going on that's what
[1:20:47.920 --> 1:20:52.080]  I would do because if you explain to people what this is really about it's a litmus test
[1:20:52.080 --> 1:20:54.280]  they don't care what color they are they're going to get it.
[1:20:54.280 --> 1:20:59.320]  Yeah and it's great that in the last five years we've really a lot of the general public
[1:20:59.320 --> 1:21:04.680]  is waking up to the fact that all of the major institutions and all of the government or
[1:21:04.680 --> 1:21:09.960]  entities are they're all polluted so we now know the FBI totally compromised we know now
[1:21:09.960 --> 1:21:15.000]  that the U.S. military is being totally compromised we have this Crete Millie I mean he is emblematic
[1:21:15.000 --> 1:21:18.480]  of what's going on in the military at this point so people are starting to wake up and
[1:21:18.480 --> 1:21:22.360]  thankfully that the Fox News boomy cons are starting to get it now we really need everyone
[1:21:22.360 --> 1:21:27.520]  to be aware of the fact that the institutions that you trusted for so long are turned against
[1:21:27.520 --> 1:21:30.200]  you and people need to be aware of that now.
[1:21:30.200 --> 1:21:34.520]  When you look at Millie up there saying I want to know about the whiteness I'm white
[1:21:34.520 --> 1:21:41.360]  I want to know why whites attacked the capital that had nothing to do with race it had to
[1:21:41.360 --> 1:21:45.720]  do with people angry at a million people out there and a few hundred going in because they
[1:21:45.720 --> 1:21:50.820]  were waved in and a few dozen maybe being somewhat violent I mean to him to just brand
[1:21:50.820 --> 1:21:55.760]  everything racial that is so evil yeah and and and that's another thing that they want
[1:21:55.760 --> 1:22:00.880]  to do just drive out decent you know American stock heritage Americans out of the military
[1:22:00.880 --> 1:22:04.920]  as well and they'd rather have probably have you know a legal alien serving in the military
[1:22:04.920 --> 1:22:07.960]  that that'll be another thing they'll be pushing for they have been pushing that for that for
[1:22:07.960 --> 1:22:12.520]  years and just people who wouldn't really care if they're ordered to be turned against
[1:22:12.520 --> 1:22:17.280]  the American people because they don't have any vested interest I mean I think Millie
[1:22:17.280 --> 1:22:21.120]  should be arrested I mean they want to arrest us they're saying we're all terrorists they're
[1:22:21.120 --> 1:22:26.720]  saying they're using the military to spy on us domestically these people really are enemies
[1:22:26.720 --> 1:22:30.120]  of the country and I don't want anything bad to happen to them I'll turn them into a martyr
[1:22:30.120 --> 1:22:35.120]  I'm just saying we should recognize true enemies that have taken the country over and then
[1:22:35.120 --> 1:22:40.000]  how that their UN operatives in charge did you see where the Secretary of State has invited
[1:22:40.000 --> 1:22:45.120]  the UN in to fix American racism yeah and and they've actually been using the UN to
[1:22:45.120 --> 1:22:50.480]  at the border they've been using different NGOs and and well the UN is in charge of the
[1:22:50.480 --> 1:22:55.360]  border now exactly signed an executive order right exactly so we see this creep that they're
[1:22:55.360 --> 1:23:00.640]  they're inviting them in for more and more roles in the US the landscape and then political
[1:23:00.640 --> 1:23:04.440]  landscape and then what else is on your editor so we're going to talk about a lot of stuff
[1:23:04.440 --> 1:23:08.720]  today but what else is front and center for Dan Lyman at Europe Wars dot com well definitely
[1:23:08.720 --> 1:23:14.160]  always the Europe situation and it's always troubling to see anything going on in Africa
[1:23:14.160 --> 1:23:18.480]  or any destabilization there because that inevitably turns into another migration wave
[1:23:18.480 --> 1:23:22.080]  anytime had something happened so keeping an eye on what's going on in South Africa
[1:23:22.080 --> 1:23:27.120]  because that's inevitably going to push thousands or tens of thousands more migrants towards
[1:23:27.120 --> 1:23:31.080]  Europe so that's that's something that's inter interlinked and of course we're we're keeping
[1:23:31.080 --> 1:23:35.000]  an eye on that and the situation in Europe between COVID and of course the immigration
[1:23:35.000 --> 1:23:41.600]  situation it is just as bad as ever well everyone knew that when they got rid of apartheid in
[1:23:41.600 --> 1:23:45.240]  South Africa and went communist that within 30 years it would be where it is now it's
[1:23:45.240 --> 1:23:50.040]  not a defensive apartheid it's what happened in Rhodesia it's what happened everywhere
[1:23:50.040 --> 1:23:53.720]  and it's not a defensive apartheid it's the fact that when you get rid of the capitalism
[1:23:53.720 --> 1:23:57.840]  that happened to be there and bring in the communism this is what communist do yeah and
[1:23:57.840 --> 1:24:02.120]  you know I think we've all been watching wondering when exactly South Africa was truly going to
[1:24:02.120 --> 1:24:06.320]  destabilize and it really seems like we're looking at that right now and and we're also
[1:24:06.320 --> 1:24:10.460]  looking at that in the Caribbean we have situations going on in Haiti and Cuba now and so you
[1:24:10.460 --> 1:24:15.360]  have to wonder is any of this interlinked and and what is the plan behind it because
[1:24:15.360 --> 1:24:20.280]  it's not just purely grassroots going on in all these countries of course we're learning
[1:24:20.280 --> 1:24:24.440]  now that some of the operatives that assassinated the Haitian president were trained by the
[1:24:24.440 --> 1:24:29.520]  US military they have US law enforcement ties so we have to say what's going on and why
[1:24:29.520 --> 1:24:33.680]  are all these countries destabilizing right now and where is the connection yeah just
[1:24:33.680 --> 1:24:37.640]  like the capital evidence is mounting that globalist intelligence groups provocateur
[1:24:37.640 --> 1:24:40.720]  heard these guys into doing it just like the green berets that thought they were about
[1:24:40.720 --> 1:24:45.360]  to take over Venezuela were tricked into doing it that's a classic provocateur action will
[1:24:45.360 --> 1:24:50.360]  cover it all on the other side and look at South Africa that was already unstable but
[1:24:50.360 --> 1:24:58.040]  is now descending into road warrior so many people say to me Alex please stop being so
[1:24:58.040 --> 1:25:03.880]  negative well for me admitting I've gotten a rotten tooth and going in a root canal is
[1:25:03.880 --> 1:25:09.160]  not negative it hurts it stinks it's got pus coming out of it I go to the doctor they
[1:25:09.160 --> 1:25:14.360]  fix it that's not negative I'm not living in denial and so think of globalism as being
[1:25:14.360 --> 1:25:19.280]  hidden as an infection that we feel yet but now it's come to the surface that's actually
[1:25:19.280 --> 1:25:24.920]  a positive thing and so yeah Trump did overall a great job they stole the election we can't
[1:25:24.920 --> 1:25:31.480]  get down about that we have forced them out in the open so now they're trying to suppress
[1:25:31.480 --> 1:25:35.840]  us because they know they've been exposed they're scared that's why instead of saying
[1:25:35.840 --> 1:25:39.360]  oh we're a bunch of losers look what happened no we're a bunch of winners they're trying
[1:25:39.360 --> 1:25:44.680]  to suppress us let our light of truth shine and tell everybody what's happening your own

[1:26:01.960 --> 1:26:10.640]  have its revolution we have to first recognize this anti-human takeovers trying to enslave
[1:26:10.640 --> 1:26:16.240]  the entire biological processes of humans and turn us into these artificial corporate
[1:26:16.240 --> 1:26:26.400]  controlled slaves or slaves just just property from cradle to grave of the system rendered
[1:26:26.400 --> 1:26:33.680]  down to be servile minions of the system and a ritual of dominance and safety and control
[1:26:33.680 --> 1:26:38.960]  we have to recognize the great reset post industrial world which realizes a nightmare dystopia
[1:26:38.960 --> 1:26:43.800]  and we have to promote liberty and freedom that is the opposite of their dystopia it's
[1:26:43.800 --> 1:26:49.120]  that choice it's that realization that's going to change the world and it's the only choice
[1:26:49.120 --> 1:26:54.400]  we've got freedom or slavery go to evil it is a spiritual battle and info wars at the

[1:29:09.320 --> 1:29:29.240]  well it's a great nineteen eighty film by john carpenter escape from new york with one
[1:29:29.240 --> 1:29:34.480]  of my favorite actors current russel and you see the real escape from new york happening
[1:29:34.480 --> 1:29:39.320]  in a real escape from los angeles jitroy michigan happening to places like texas and florida
[1:29:39.320 --> 1:29:44.720]  and others but people are trying to exit out of europe as well but so much of the world
[1:29:44.720 --> 1:29:49.600]  is locked down under marshal law we have informational marshal law coming in we're even the former
[1:29:49.600 --> 1:29:54.920]  president of the united states isn't allowed on facebook or twitter we are in marshal law
[1:29:54.920 --> 1:29:59.800]  and you know dan london made that point out of the gates he lives in switzerland near the
[1:29:59.800 --> 1:30:03.680]  break i said there's so much to cover where should we start you said well we could have
[1:30:03.680 --> 1:30:07.840]  a whole site or a whole show or a whole report just on france or just on south africa or
[1:30:07.840 --> 1:30:14.120]  just on cuba or just on blue cities everyone is fleeing leftist cities everyone is fleeing
[1:30:14.120 --> 1:30:18.960]  leftist countries everyone wants out from under it but all the big money wants to finance
[1:30:18.960 --> 1:30:23.720]  it because big corporations a little secret is control these authoritarian regimes and
[1:30:23.720 --> 1:30:28.080]  communism and socialism is their favorite system of control because it makes the people dependent
[1:30:28.080 --> 1:30:32.480]  so they don't know how to take care of themselves so dan london let's get into south africa
[1:30:32.480 --> 1:30:37.120]  for folks that don't know what's happened all of africa is descending into total collapse
[1:30:37.120 --> 1:30:41.400]  qaddafi wasn't a great guy but he was stabilizing africa so they took him out apartheid wasn't
[1:30:41.400 --> 1:30:45.120]  a good thing but it was making people wealthy including the blacks so they had to get rid
[1:30:45.120 --> 1:30:49.360]  of it because there was actually capitalism and societal order and they weren't letting
[1:30:49.360 --> 1:30:53.720]  different black tribes kill each other well that's gone now so the big internationalists
[1:30:53.720 --> 1:30:56.960]  can come in and get the diamonds and gold and everything and the general public and
[1:30:56.960 --> 1:31:02.280]  starved to death and so that's the model there we see what's happening there the same
[1:31:02.280 --> 1:31:08.960]  marxist information liberal media defending it when indians defend their homes or businesses
[1:31:08.960 --> 1:31:14.440]  from looters were told they're racist and again we see this lionization of black looters
[1:31:14.440 --> 1:31:20.560]  by the media here and in south africa not to protect black people but to ensure destabilization
[1:31:20.560 --> 1:31:26.560]  happens so that they all continue to live in squalor and depopulate it's extremely cynical
[1:31:26.560 --> 1:31:30.280]  in my view what's your view on all this well it is really interesting that you say that
[1:31:30.280 --> 1:31:34.280]  because there is an I've seen evidence that there is kind of a coalition of different
[1:31:34.280 --> 1:31:38.720]  groups you see some of these folks here that there's there's muslim groups there's indigenous
[1:31:38.720 --> 1:31:44.200]  south africans there are certain black groups as well and whites as well who are basically
[1:31:44.200 --> 1:31:48.400]  aligned now and they're like trying to fend off these looters and prevent them from totally
[1:31:48.400 --> 1:31:52.040]  decimating their towns and their stores and their malls so it's interesting and that's
[1:31:52.040 --> 1:31:55.960]  not getting very that's key a large percentage are blacks that don't want to live in death
[1:31:55.960 --> 1:31:59.280]  of destruction but the media doesn't do that they make it like a black lives matter thing
[1:31:59.280 --> 1:32:02.840]  and all these folks burning down the power stations and shopping malls and killing people
[1:32:02.840 --> 1:32:07.280]  they're good and if the indians that bunch up and live there for 100 years plus oh if
[1:32:07.280 --> 1:32:11.520]  the indians that you know came there basically a slave labor themselves if the evil indians
[1:32:11.520 --> 1:32:14.760]  brought there by the british empire now the grandkids and great grandkids if they don't
[1:32:14.760 --> 1:32:18.440]  want their house burned and their wife raped their evil right and and they're just trying
[1:32:18.440 --> 1:32:22.960]  to defend themselves and it looks like things are getting incredibly worse there and of
[1:32:22.960 --> 1:32:26.440]  course we've all been watching and it's been a powder keg for a long time but it really
[1:32:26.440 --> 1:32:30.120]  seems to be kicking off and you know our hearts go out to all the innocent people there that
[1:32:30.120 --> 1:32:33.360]  are getting caught in this because it really is terrible and i interrupted you i'm good
[1:32:33.360 --> 1:32:37.080]  at that you're the guest get into this coalition because that's what the media is trying to
[1:32:37.080 --> 1:32:41.320]  hide of people that want civilization versus those that don't right and that's what we're
[1:32:41.320 --> 1:32:46.320]  seeing across the west across the western world is you have people who just want to
[1:32:46.320 --> 1:32:50.920]  be left alone they want to have freedom they want to have to be able to to buy and sell
[1:32:50.920 --> 1:32:55.160]  like you know capitalism and then you have these insane communists who are just going
[1:32:55.160 --> 1:32:58.960]  insane and they're being allowed to you we have this of course in latin america we have
[1:32:58.960 --> 1:33:03.560]  latin america now the whole media is race-based this is video of whites being bullwhiped by
[1:33:03.560 --> 1:33:07.560]  black communists because they're white right and then you know we we have this happening
[1:33:07.560 --> 1:33:12.280]  there but then when a couple of soccer players in the uk have been you know had some some
[1:33:12.280 --> 1:33:17.160]  not nice things said to them online the entire media has been into has been you know attacking
[1:33:17.160 --> 1:33:21.280]  that they're trying to basically ban people off the internet in the uk now at this point
[1:33:21.280 --> 1:33:25.840]  under the guise of you know preventing people from having an anonymous accounts we have
[1:33:25.840 --> 1:33:29.760]  piers morgan saying that there should be no one else allowed to use the internet with
[1:33:29.760 --> 1:33:35.360]  an anonymous account we have just a just an amazing push to crack down on free speech
[1:33:35.360 --> 1:33:38.960]  but then you have white people being whipped by a by a couple of south african blacks in
[1:33:38.960 --> 1:33:43.280]  the media couldn't care less yeah i forgot to add that the uk government now wants internet
[1:33:43.280 --> 1:33:48.360]  id so there can't be voter id in the uk or here but we need internet id to make sure
[1:33:48.360 --> 1:33:51.760]  we can censor everybody absolutely and you know uh back to what you were saying about
[1:33:51.760 --> 1:33:56.360]  the kind of the the informational martial law i just saw a clip before we came on air
[1:33:56.360 --> 1:34:00.960]  of the prime minister of new zealand just in the ardern and she was basically telling
[1:34:00.960 --> 1:34:04.720]  people that if the coveted information does not originate from the government then you
[1:34:04.720 --> 1:34:08.360]  need to disregard it and please stop sharing it around and the government will be your
[1:34:08.360 --> 1:34:12.240]  only source of information on coveted data so you tie that in with what we're seeing
[1:34:12.240 --> 1:34:15.400]  around the world you tie that in with the with the uh with democrats wanting to spy
[1:34:15.400 --> 1:34:20.680]  on our sms um you know at what point are they just going to start choking off basically
[1:34:20.680 --> 1:34:24.200]  all sources of information even well that's it we've already been brought into a digital
[1:34:24.200 --> 1:34:28.360]  martial law a physical martial law and now they're just submitting it and getting ready
[1:34:28.360 --> 1:34:32.160]  for the next wave that's what's happening here is there they're taking a big gulp of
[1:34:32.160 --> 1:34:35.800]  air before they plunge us back down under the water yeah and and and they're they're
[1:34:35.800 --> 1:34:39.800]  more and more saying basically we're not going to be able to to share information without
[1:34:39.800 --> 1:34:45.240]  them policing it or shutting it down and what are they telling you oh um we're gonna not
[1:34:45.240 --> 1:34:48.040]  let you have medical care we're not going to give you treatment when you have pneumonia
[1:34:48.040 --> 1:34:50.560]  we're going to say it's coveted we're not going to let you have known treatments that
[1:34:50.560 --> 1:34:55.800]  are 99 effective i mean this is really monstrous criminal activity adan salazar covered it before
[1:34:55.800 --> 1:34:59.480]  you got on wrote an article about something in the news that john hopkins a woman that
[1:34:59.480 --> 1:35:03.920]  was a nurse she signed on to work there she was given the shot she died their family said
[1:35:03.920 --> 1:35:08.200]  the shot killed her the doctors thought that we just linked to her story they banned him
[1:35:08.200 --> 1:35:12.640]  off twitter are suspending saying that's just info you're not allowed to criticize the vaccine
[1:35:12.640 --> 1:35:17.680]  i mean you're now aiding in a bedding covering up people's deaths this is sick it really
[1:35:17.680 --> 1:35:22.840]  is i was told by a friend recently in switzerland he's an actual swiss native and he said if
[1:35:22.840 --> 1:35:26.600]  you he said people have been showing up that he knows for for regular treatments or going
[1:35:26.600 --> 1:35:30.680]  to the emergency room in switzerland at the at the hospitals and if they aren't vaccinated
[1:35:30.680 --> 1:35:33.840]  they are told you must get vaccinated before you enter or you can't come in for medical
[1:35:33.840 --> 1:35:36.960]  treatment i haven't been able to verify that but he has multiple people who's telling
[1:35:36.960 --> 1:35:40.760]  how they're doing and it's all color of law it's what we tell we got democrats katleen
[1:35:40.760 --> 1:35:45.480]  similius is on tv former head of health human services says the same thing yeah she says
[1:35:45.480 --> 1:35:49.720]  you shouldn't have access to your children shouldn't have a job if you don't take an
[1:35:49.720 --> 1:35:54.960]  experimental job again cut and dry violation nuremberg code nuremberg code says you can't
[1:35:54.960 --> 1:35:59.280]  take jobs away you can't threaten things for medical experimentation this is experimental
[1:35:59.280 --> 1:36:02.320]  absolutely and you know what we've seen of course with these these protests kicking off
[1:36:02.320 --> 1:36:05.640]  in france they're they're you know their backs backs are up against the wall but this is
[1:36:05.640 --> 1:36:09.680]  also the case they've they've made the same announcements in greece and the same announcements
[1:36:09.680 --> 1:36:14.560]  in cyprus and what's interesting is you have for the past 18 months we've had the the entire
[1:36:14.560 --> 1:36:19.520]  media and just the the leftist organizations touting medical workers as being the heroes
[1:36:19.520 --> 1:36:23.320]  the heroes the heroes you know clap for the nhs but now the medical workers are finding
[1:36:23.320 --> 1:36:27.120]  out they're going to be the first ones corralled into force vaccinations and they're being
[1:36:27.120 --> 1:36:31.480]  told that you can if you have if you work in the medical field in france and you and
[1:36:31.480 --> 1:36:36.520]  you do not get vaccinated you will lose your job and guys go ahead and roll clip nine here
[1:36:36.520 --> 1:36:41.640]  police throw tear gas at demonstrators guess who's exempt in france from the mandatory
[1:36:41.640 --> 1:36:46.600]  injections announced by mcron outside of law i just said it i'm the president the police
[1:36:46.600 --> 1:36:53.480]  won't take it the police are exempt man you talk about evil and he has said if if uh
[1:36:53.480 --> 1:36:57.440]  you know if they are not able to corral enough people into getting the vaccine now with these
[1:36:57.440 --> 1:37:01.960]  new rules and they then they're talking about complete and total force vaccination for the
[1:37:01.960 --> 1:37:06.080]  entire french population which what they always say if you won't take it we're going to make
[1:37:06.080 --> 1:37:09.920]  you take it but we're going to make you take it it's it's it's it look you're going to
[1:37:09.920 --> 1:37:13.680]  get sick you're going to die and they're going to say now they say oh it doesn't protect
[1:37:13.680 --> 1:37:17.120]  you you need a booster shot how did bill gates know that a year ago and said that would be
[1:37:17.120 --> 1:37:21.800]  the case how did we know that because bill gates said it that's the thing is people ask
[1:37:21.800 --> 1:37:26.480]  jones how did you know that they've announced new lockdowns how'd you know the vaccine
[1:37:26.480 --> 1:37:31.040]  wouldn't work because we interview the top scientist you cannot create a vaccine for
[1:37:31.040 --> 1:37:35.280]  a cold virus there's thousands of them you can only make one for a spike protein but
[1:37:35.280 --> 1:37:40.880]  that spike protein is in your body i mean they knew when they did this folks that it
[1:37:40.880 --> 1:37:45.760]  is a civilization ending event it will make us not trust doctors not trust the government
[1:37:45.760 --> 1:37:49.600]  it'll break down society will make people be scared not go to work it will make you want
[1:37:49.600 --> 1:37:53.280]  to take care of their sick loved ones that have been given the deadly shot it's going
[1:37:53.280 --> 1:37:57.680]  to collapse civilization if we don't reverse it quickly it may be too late already it's
[1:37:57.680 --> 1:38:01.560]  dividing people we have you know people we had that story with owen uh golfing with some
[1:38:01.560 --> 1:38:05.280]  guys on the on the golf course we said were basically conservative views but when they
[1:38:05.280 --> 1:38:09.040]  found out that he was opposed to the vaccine they walked off the golf course they wouldn't
[1:38:09.040 --> 1:38:12.640]  even play with him anyway well it was a power trip that they'd taken it and they were good
[1:38:12.640 --> 1:38:15.600]  and now they're going to have the app that they're going to show people they did it
[1:38:15.600 --> 1:38:19.600]  when they're just being brought into a social credit score slave app he told those guys two
[1:38:19.600 --> 1:38:24.560]  years ago having to make you carry an app to go to a store or go to get a car or to go
[1:38:24.560 --> 1:38:28.200]  to the bank you'd say that's crazy i'm not going to have a government app but now you
[1:38:28.200 --> 1:38:32.680]  see they're heroes they stepped up and they took it down and we've been we've been warning
[1:38:32.680 --> 1:38:37.320]  about this for over a year and you have found so much vindication from so many people now
[1:38:37.320 --> 1:38:41.320]  who say you know alex was warning about this long ago and they say how did you know because
[1:38:41.320 --> 1:38:44.920]  of course you were reviewing what everything that they were laying out they had the different
[1:38:44.920 --> 1:38:50.280]  organizations the who the e you were all planning an end game for for years now where they were
[1:38:50.280 --> 1:38:54.280]  going to get to vaccine vaccine passport it's all been premeditated just like we'll probably
[1:38:54.280 --> 1:38:59.120]  come back i never had a marketing plan for impool wars i went out and found the best
[1:38:59.120 --> 1:39:03.440]  products i could find from the research to funder operation i wanted you to get products

[1:43:59.080 --> 1:44:04.400]  for joining us on this thursday broadcast july 15th i want to just pull back with what
[1:44:04.400 --> 1:44:10.720]  damn was trying to get into before the break there interrupting it's all premeditated here's
[1:44:10.720 --> 1:44:18.360]  how it works very simply you have the big central banks that if you adopt the codes
[1:44:18.360 --> 1:44:24.120]  and political corporate systems of the world economic forum and you do what they say and
[1:44:24.120 --> 1:44:28.400]  they interface with the u n the big banks then you'll be given credit you'll be given access
[1:44:28.400 --> 1:44:33.880]  to the market you'll be allowed to become rich and powerful and they said before the
[1:44:33.880 --> 1:44:37.280]  outbreak even happened they already changed the definition of a pandemic for something
[1:44:37.280 --> 1:44:41.480]  actually killing you to something they claim you have they already said once pandemics
[1:44:41.480 --> 1:44:47.240]  hit you'll have to have qr codes on all the menus to get everyone ready for qr codes even
[1:44:47.240 --> 1:44:53.320]  come in a restaurant all of this is training they admitted it's all premeditated so people
[1:44:53.320 --> 1:44:58.000]  tune in and they keep saying and we keep getting credit which is really stupid because i even
[1:44:58.000 --> 1:45:01.560]  have lawyers and academics ask me how did you predict this how'd you pretend i said it's
[1:45:01.560 --> 1:45:06.360]  all laid out by claus schwaab he says it ends with a microchip and then they can cut off
[1:45:06.360 --> 1:45:12.880]  all your resources one way or the other social credit scores hell on earth our own governments
[1:45:12.880 --> 1:45:19.320]  defending cuba oppressing its people we're in trouble so then you've been in europe you're
[1:45:19.320 --> 1:45:27.720]  an american you see all this they're now announcing military base orders troops to show vaccination
[1:45:27.720 --> 1:45:36.400]  proof as covid-19 concerns mount oh a first hero major general david francis says anyone
[1:45:36.400 --> 1:45:40.960]  coming on base must now have the proof it's just up to you to get it done and of course
[1:45:40.960 --> 1:45:46.840]  then there's always more more more shots the u.s. surgeon general is calling covid-19 misinformation
[1:45:46.840 --> 1:45:53.560]  an urgent threat calling for it to be silenced which the democrats now say they need to read
[1:45:53.560 --> 1:45:59.720]  all your text messages in live times are value to keep you safe one of the new zealand leaders
[1:45:59.720 --> 1:46:07.920]  just say it's all the same day france greece the uk announced oh forced inoculations covid
[1:46:07.920 --> 1:46:13.160]  passports are coming macron says now and then the next day oh a military base and then oh
[1:46:13.160 --> 1:46:16.840]  oh all these leaders all the diss info is going to kill people because they're getting ready
[1:46:16.840 --> 1:46:22.040]  for a lockdown two and lockdown one didn't go like they wanted so now they're like we
[1:46:22.040 --> 1:46:27.040]  better silence everybody because we're costing lives that's what falci said we've got to read
[1:46:27.040 --> 1:46:31.400]  your text messages we've got a nut you can't let you talk about hydroxychloroquine or how
[1:46:31.400 --> 1:46:35.000]  we're counting people that died automobile accidents is covid i mean we can't let you
[1:46:35.000 --> 1:46:39.920]  know that we're killing people with with with with ventilators i mean they've got so they're
[1:46:39.920 --> 1:46:44.520]  going ahead with their operation but it hits a major bump standpoint definitely and you
[1:46:44.520 --> 1:46:49.280]  know going back to what you were saying about lockdown two people all they have to do is
[1:46:49.280 --> 1:46:53.960]  look at what's going on in australia right now because the australians have been in perpetual
[1:46:53.960 --> 1:46:58.360]  lockdown and now they're going into harder lockdowns in sydney for like even if supposed
[1:46:58.360 --> 1:47:02.920]  case is just a handful and so if anyone wants to know what's coming look at what's going
[1:47:02.920 --> 1:47:07.320]  on in canada look at what's going on in australia they are basically setting the pace where
[1:47:07.320 --> 1:47:12.160]  for where the rest of us are going and now the netherlands just did it to reimpose work
[1:47:12.160 --> 1:47:19.040]  from phone as infections so sore not deaths but the pcr test says oh right and and you
[1:47:19.040 --> 1:47:23.200]  know they're going to keep doing the test you want marshal law turn the pcr test up
[1:47:23.200 --> 1:47:28.200]  want want to say it's okay turn it down you behave we turn it down you go outside oh there's
[1:47:28.200 --> 1:47:33.520]  bad viruses we turn it up oh it's safe i mean this is so transparent yeah you know i just
[1:47:33.520 --> 1:47:37.480]  had my first covid test i managed to go this long without having one but i had to get one
[1:47:37.480 --> 1:47:41.920]  to get into the us and went through the whole process and thankfully it wasn't your country
[1:47:41.920 --> 1:47:46.840]  born here where is it you gotta have a virus test well i had to have it in switzerland because
[1:47:46.840 --> 1:47:50.960]  it's mandated by the by the u.s. government and of course by the airlines but what's interesting
[1:47:50.960 --> 1:47:56.080]  was i showed it to get onto the plane in switzerland i get the customs and border protection they
[1:47:56.080 --> 1:48:00.400]  didn't check anything i could have just walked into the country and they had no idea so it's
[1:48:00.400 --> 1:48:04.120]  it's mandated by the government i have to go through all the song and dance on my end
[1:48:04.120 --> 1:48:08.720]  pay the fee you know how this invasive test spend four hours doing that and then get to
[1:48:08.720 --> 1:48:14.160]  the u.s. and no one checks very strange it's all about your submission just like senator
[1:48:14.160 --> 1:48:19.760]  paul said yeah it's a it's a circus so how do we organize to the governors to the leaders
[1:48:19.760 --> 1:48:23.880]  through a corporate alliance that says we don't live in fear we know what's happening
[1:48:23.880 --> 1:48:27.920]  have everybody have you know sign up where we you know we we wave liability we come in
[1:48:27.920 --> 1:48:32.000]  your business i mean i think that's the answer start forming our own civilization now because
[1:48:32.000 --> 1:48:36.040]  they're going to use our interconnected civilization to oppress us we have to understand they've
[1:48:36.040 --> 1:48:40.120]  hijacked the civilization how do we how do we build a new civilization well that that
[1:48:40.120 --> 1:48:43.800]  doubt that would be a great place to start but unfortunately what i've noticed is i was
[1:48:43.800 --> 1:48:48.360]  just spent some time in florida and masks are optional there in the in the stores and
[1:48:48.360 --> 1:48:53.080]  in the restaurants and you know i was in a mall in miami and i was probably one of only
[1:48:53.080 --> 1:48:57.080]  five percent of people who was not wearing a mask 95 percent of people well that's because
[1:48:57.080 --> 1:49:01.400]  of them i mean i'm i'm gonna say it uh i don't know what it is but minority areas in miami's
[1:49:01.400 --> 1:49:05.240]  quote you know i mean why forgot the minority pretty much but i've just noticed when i'm
[1:49:05.240 --> 1:49:09.640]  in minority areas they're almost full wearing yeah uh and but then you go to uh you know
[1:49:09.640 --> 1:49:14.120]  blue collar wide areas even blue collar hispanic areas are not wearing them so i think it has
[1:49:14.120 --> 1:49:19.000]  a trendy thing about it that that could be the case for sure what else did you say well
[1:49:19.000 --> 1:49:23.640]  uh of course in miami they're they're starting to protest uh because of the the cuba situation
[1:49:23.640 --> 1:49:28.360]  there are tons of cubans in miami and uh you know and i feel so much empathy for the cuban
[1:49:28.360 --> 1:49:33.160]  people they've been through so much but i am disheartened and disturbed to see us officials
[1:49:33.160 --> 1:49:37.240]  you know we had the mayor of miami basically talking about bombing cuba now and they were
[1:49:37.240 --> 1:49:41.240]  and all these people calling for troops to be sent to cuba uh i understand it's a terrible
[1:49:41.240 --> 1:49:45.400]  situation but we can't be meddling in every single affair all around the world and you
[1:49:45.400 --> 1:49:50.040]  do have to wonder the timing of pulling out of afghanistan practically overnight and we you
[1:49:50.040 --> 1:49:53.080]  know we're pulling the troops out of there and now we have multiple countries in the
[1:49:53.080 --> 1:49:56.760]  caribbean that are begging for troops to be sent in there so what is going on is there
[1:49:56.760 --> 1:49:59.720]  a connection there i've been wondering about that as well but well there's definitely something
[1:49:59.720 --> 1:50:04.680]  going on with haydie you know that he wouldn't do the force inoculation now it's three african
[1:50:04.680 --> 1:50:10.440]  presidents the same old died yeah we had tansania and uh he was the guy that was the doctor who
[1:50:10.440 --> 1:50:15.560]  was testing papayas and goats and they were coming back uh on the pcr test is covered yeah and then
[1:50:15.560 --> 1:50:21.160]  they they did away with him quick i mean i was gone right after that uh that's what they call
[1:50:21.160 --> 1:50:24.840]  the economic hitman so so so dan let's finish up with the whole covid thing and then i want to get
[1:50:24.840 --> 1:50:31.160]  into france europe because all of that's coming here i mean clearly that's the whole marx sociology
[1:50:31.160 --> 1:50:36.040]  that's black lives matter that's what they want why do you think that's what the system wants
[1:50:36.920 --> 1:50:42.040]  i think the ultimately the end game is destabilization you're seeing every single western
[1:50:42.040 --> 1:50:46.440]  city now is on the decline they're allowing you know people are locked up in their homes
[1:50:46.440 --> 1:50:50.760]  but then they're allowing rampant homelessness and that is the same case in europe as well you have
[1:50:50.760 --> 1:50:55.800]  places like paris where you have migrants basically taking over thousands of migrants living uh you
[1:50:55.800 --> 1:51:00.840]  know packed intense living on canals and living under overpasses and that's allowed while the
[1:51:00.840 --> 1:51:05.480]  french people for a long time couldn't even leave their home without government papers so
[1:51:05.480 --> 1:51:10.840]  they're allowing the decay and the filth uh to spread in our cities i mean i was out in austin
[1:51:10.840 --> 1:51:14.440]  last night things aren't looking too good there either and uh they're allowing this to happen
[1:51:14.440 --> 1:51:18.680]  in supposedly in the middle of a pandemic you're allowing the filth to spread throughout the streets
[1:51:18.680 --> 1:51:23.000]  that you know it doesn't really add up unless you realize that this is all a plan to basically
[1:51:23.000 --> 1:51:27.880]  break down society and and where does it go when it breaks down well they want the breakdown they
[1:51:27.880 --> 1:51:33.480]  want a post-industrial world they want the the the open free society that's wealthy and successful
[1:51:33.480 --> 1:51:38.520]  where we we have high standards we want quality everybody wanted to come here because the quality
[1:51:38.520 --> 1:51:43.080]  they're getting rid of the quality because they're so ultra rich they have their own reservations
[1:51:43.080 --> 1:51:47.960]  their own private jets their own private compounds and they're literally waging ruling class war on
[1:51:47.960 --> 1:51:53.240]  us it's the ultra rich funding the great reset the open borders everything right and if people
[1:51:53.240 --> 1:51:58.040]  want to know what comes down the line just look at south africa what's going on there
[1:51:59.240 --> 1:52:06.760]  why would the establishment keep pushing this why won't they stop uh they're demonic maniacal
[1:52:06.760 --> 1:52:12.360]  totally uh totally possessed by evil and uh and they want to destroy us you know as the population
[1:52:12.360 --> 1:52:18.200]  is then they have no um no concern about the human race about our well-being so they they like to see
[1:52:18.200 --> 1:52:22.600]  a suffer and they like to see us you know in in struggling and and enslaved at the well that's
[1:52:22.600 --> 1:52:27.080]  really it they enjoy death and destruction and degradation and evil and and so we've let evil
[1:52:27.080 --> 1:52:34.120]  people get control they broke on the social compact uh and do you think there's any level the average
[1:52:34.120 --> 1:52:37.720]  leftist will go before they wake up that they're not part of it because the average leftist now
[1:52:37.720 --> 1:52:41.480]  I've learned actually knows about the takedown the collapse they think it's fun they think it's
[1:52:41.480 --> 1:52:46.040]  clower and pivot they think they're about to be in charge yeah you know I being back and
[1:52:46.040 --> 1:52:49.400]  seeing some old friends and family and it's good to talk to some people and see where they're at
[1:52:49.400 --> 1:52:53.560]  this point and some of the you know that may be the centrist types they're getting it and they're
[1:52:53.560 --> 1:52:58.520]  starting to be really disturbed but people who are who were inclined to be liberals left us I mean
[1:52:58.520 --> 1:53:03.400]  they're going harder than ever trump derangement syndrome broke them down first now they have
[1:53:03.400 --> 1:53:07.960]  covid derangement syndrome and and they are going all in on this and uh you know it's it's
[1:53:07.960 --> 1:53:11.960]  disturbing all people want to talk about is the vaccine at this point it's the conversations that
[1:53:11.960 --> 1:53:16.280]  I hear are just vaccine vaccine vaccine and that's all they want to talk about and uh it's like
[1:53:16.280 --> 1:53:21.960]  it's totally consumed their minds at this point and by the way numbers this year of deaths are
[1:53:21.960 --> 1:53:26.760]  way up folks from all sorts of things they just don't call it covid all these vaccinated people
[1:53:26.760 --> 1:53:30.840]  are shedding and that's what the document showed all sorts of horrible things this was not a regular
[1:53:30.840 --> 1:53:36.520]  virus this takes your body over and makes it produce viruses so uh they've they've created
[1:53:36.520 --> 1:53:40.920]  the bio attack and they're going to blame uh you know new covid or something or people that didn't
[1:53:40.920 --> 1:53:47.880]  be part of the lockdown on all the deaths this winter x2 has been our number one bestseller

[1:56:26.280 --> 1:56:33.400]  you make technology more complex it's something we got to work on and by remote control they had to
[1:56:33.400 --> 1:56:39.000]  take my mic live there so that's what was going on just now and that's why I spent so much money
[1:56:39.000 --> 1:56:43.480]  man putting hard wiring in here like eight years ago everything was hardwired I don't know why we've
[1:56:43.480 --> 1:56:49.240]  gone to internet inside the building sounds like a disaster to me but Dan Lyman's here with us
[1:56:49.240 --> 1:56:54.360]  today we're going to work on these problems and come back with him it's a miracle band
[1:56:54.360 --> 1:56:57.880]  that he owes up it's a miracle this damn show is even on the air let's go ahead and go to
[1:56:57.880 --> 1:57:11.560]  Gregory's latest report on this is the end here it is as far as the public was concerned the Nazis
[1:57:11.560 --> 1:57:18.280]  may have lost the war but their ideology has continued to spread ever since following world
[1:57:18.280 --> 1:57:24.760]  war two came the united nations mass fluoridation of the water supply the dumbing down of the
[1:57:24.760 --> 1:57:32.680]  education system postmodernism political correctness and the war on drugs for many this has gone
[1:57:32.680 --> 1:57:39.400]  unnoticed the Nazis became the pop culture model of fascism black leather and jack boots
[1:57:39.400 --> 1:57:46.280]  became the symbols of authoritarianism fascism could now hide itself behind a smile in a suit
[1:57:46.280 --> 1:57:53.720]  and a tie the majority had no idea of the global fascist state being slowly installed behind the
[1:57:53.720 --> 1:58:00.440]  scenes and now it's here covid was just the beginning of their endgame the same private
[1:58:00.440 --> 1:58:07.240]  corporations and NGOs that planned and executed the covid hoax are now preparing the next phase
[1:58:08.120 --> 1:58:16.440]  we can soon expect a massive cyber attack we all know but still pay insufficient attention
[1:58:16.440 --> 1:58:25.560]  to the frightening scenario of a comprehensive cyber attack which would bring to a complete
[1:58:25.560 --> 1:58:35.240]  heart to see power supply transportation hospital services our society as a whole the
[1:58:35.240 --> 1:58:44.760]  covid 19 crisis would be seen in this respect as a small disturbance in comparison the world
[1:58:44.760 --> 1:58:51.720]  economic forum who sponsored tabletop simulations for covid just weeks before the outbreak are now
[1:58:51.720 --> 1:58:58.040]  doing the same for cyber attacks which will be the reset button needed for their great reset
[1:58:59.800 --> 1:59:05.480]  and when the grid goes down it will take banking and shipping down with it killing millions in
[1:59:05.480 --> 1:59:12.120]  the overcrowded cities those with a survival instinct will leave the cities which is why
[1:59:12.120 --> 1:59:18.120]  the rural domestic preparedness consortium a part of homeland security and fema is currently
[1:59:18.120 --> 1:59:25.800]  training for the isolation and quarantine of rural communities after their great reset we know
[1:59:25.800 --> 1:59:34.440]  how they plan to build back better two key agents of the great reset Regina Dugan and Ken Gabriel
[1:59:34.440 --> 1:59:41.720]  both worked for DARPA greenlit RNA vaccine research in 2012 and then went on to google and facebook
[1:59:41.720 --> 1:59:49.320]  where they set up DARPA equivalents in 2018 they joined welcome leap founded by the world's
[1:59:49.320 --> 1:59:57.400]  richest medical research foundation their stated goal to be completed no later than 2030 is to have
[1:59:57.400 --> 2:00:03.960]  80 percent of all children under the age of three monitored 24 seven with wearable devices
[2:00:03.960 --> 2:00:10.200]  that will read their brain patterns specifically focusing on keeping the individual motivated
[2:00:10.200 --> 2:00:18.040]  to work they plan to have an in silico model of a child's brain to be used as the model brain
[2:00:18.040 --> 2:00:25.720]  that all infants will be molded to via therapeutic interventions like slaves in a dystopian sci-fi
[2:00:25.720 --> 2:00:34.120]  movie except this is not a movie and it's no longer a conspiracy theory it's all happening the entire
[2:00:34.120 --> 2:00:41.880]  world is under attack with seemingly no pushback and if we don't pushback then it's all over

[2:03:40.760 --> 2:03:46.280]  unit in the country to use covid detection dogs bristol county and the commonwealth the
[2:03:46.280 --> 2:03:52.360]  massachusetts have come so far since the pandemic started last year when the un changed the definition
[2:03:52.360 --> 2:03:58.600]  right before they released it to say not death but the number of people that that just have it is a
[2:03:58.600 --> 2:04:04.920]  pandemic today festivals are happening restaurants are full and concert venues are packed now we're
[2:04:04.920 --> 2:04:08.200]  going to come up to you and if you're not vaccinated harass you and arrest you saying you have
[2:04:08.200 --> 2:04:14.040]  covid i mean that's what it is we've made such progress and our new covid 19 detection program
[2:04:14.040 --> 2:04:20.200]  is one way people of bristol can stay ahead of the curve oh my gosh isn't that nice two dogs
[2:04:20.200 --> 2:04:27.560]  hunter and duke were trained to shift covid 19 which the department said has a unique odor the
[2:04:27.560 --> 2:04:32.440]  department they're like scientists now a canine graduation ceremony was held wednesday so we
[2:04:32.440 --> 2:04:37.400]  got state laws banning red light cameras as they got caught cheating on them and we got state laws
[2:04:37.400 --> 2:04:45.240]  you got to calibrate uh radar guns but oh no the department says the dogs are trained to smell the
[2:04:45.240 --> 2:04:51.480]  magic virus and just buy buys this is they admit it's the cover to take us out of our homes and
[2:04:51.480 --> 2:04:57.480]  disappear us to emergency covid centers dan liman this is like right after the news that we saw
[2:04:57.480 --> 2:05:01.480]  out of abu jabi where they said they're going to be using infrared cameras to detect if you have
[2:05:01.480 --> 2:05:06.520]  covid or not and you have to wonder what is the criteria for that i mean there's going to be pulling
[2:05:06.520 --> 2:05:10.440]  people off the street at this point like you said it's just gonna be oh where'd bob go well you know
[2:05:10.440 --> 2:05:15.640]  the dog smelled something oh the pcr test they went down shown to his house he went away oh they
[2:05:15.640 --> 2:05:20.840]  had to innovate and he's dead yeah it's really disturbing and and and what what could possibly
[2:05:20.840 --> 2:05:25.880]  be the the unique sense that the dogs can be detecting from covid what is covid and is it
[2:05:25.880 --> 2:05:30.760]  maybe something in the vaccine that the dogs can smell if if the if that's the case possibly
[2:05:32.840 --> 2:05:37.480]  dan i consider ask questions all day but lockdown twos are coming they've already hit the netherlands
[2:05:37.480 --> 2:05:43.160]  they've already hit australia it it it's a permanent system teaching us to be prisoners
[2:05:43.160 --> 2:05:47.320]  and that our phones will tell us when we can go out where we can go what we can do i mean
[2:05:47.320 --> 2:05:51.400]  this is like total dystopia off the edge of the cliff we have the government documents operation
[2:05:51.400 --> 2:05:56.840]  lockstep of the rockefeller foundation i mean they did it they really did it how do you organize
[2:05:56.840 --> 2:06:01.400]  and rally people to understand that submission to this you know you don't submit and get out of
[2:06:01.400 --> 2:06:06.360]  the lockdown you get deeper into the next level of the lockdown yeah absolutely and people like we
[2:06:06.360 --> 2:06:09.400]  said we've been warning about this for so long we have this guy in canada chris guy he's been
[2:06:09.400 --> 2:06:14.360]  warning people up in canada about what was coming and and they're just not enough people listening
[2:06:14.360 --> 2:06:18.600]  but i i am heartened to see what's going on in france because they are really seem to be pushing
[2:06:18.600 --> 2:06:22.280]  back there and people make a lot of fun of the french for being very submissive but you know
[2:06:22.280 --> 2:06:27.560]  they're the first people that i've seen really out in the streets you know doing battle so to speak
[2:06:27.560 --> 2:06:33.480]  but making their voices heard and uh and this is unfortunately people have had been lax for so long
[2:06:33.480 --> 2:06:36.920]  that this is where they're gonna have to go if they want to take some freedom back well it's not
[2:06:36.920 --> 2:06:42.840]  been the feminization of france if you actually study gall that goes back into the romans before
[2:06:42.840 --> 2:06:50.600]  that the tribes that were there they have enjoyed 2 500 years of total war and after depolian killed
[2:06:50.600 --> 2:06:57.480]  roughly 40 percent of military age men in the two wars that lasted you know 15 years or so
[2:06:57.480 --> 2:07:03.800]  uh and then after world war one killed a couple million french you know the french finally just
[2:07:03.800 --> 2:07:09.320]  got the point when the vici their own generals sold them out to hitler people don't know that
[2:07:09.320 --> 2:07:13.240]  like france didn't just lose in a week their generals gave up and actually ran france after
[2:07:13.240 --> 2:07:18.280]  that that's how hitler a week after france gave up with like third paris uh and and so we're
[2:07:18.280 --> 2:07:24.200]  folks that don't know france is just just cynical because they're used to getting screwed yeah
[2:07:24.200 --> 2:07:28.280]  and you have to wonder you know what was what was a part of the agenda behind these world wars
[2:07:28.280 --> 2:07:33.880]  it took out so many great strong european men and uh and and europe is now such a feminized
[2:07:33.880 --> 2:07:39.800]  place and now they're being overrun by a new wave of much stronger more aggressive men at this point
[2:07:39.800 --> 2:07:45.800]  well take germany uh germany had 65 million people start a world war two 21 million germans died
[2:07:45.800 --> 2:07:54.440]  in world war two that's one third of the germans gone that's shocking 20 million russians died
[2:07:55.960 --> 2:08:01.560]  20 million i mean i'm not lessening the u.s roll or england's roll in world war two but
[2:08:02.120 --> 2:08:08.520]  it was kind of like the b-string was being put in later i mean 41 million dead people between
[2:08:08.520 --> 2:08:13.400]  russia and germany just toe to toe slogging it out for three years that was the real fight
[2:08:13.400 --> 2:08:21.080]  imagine 40 million dead people and some of the best bravest strongest men that's that's
[2:08:21.080 --> 2:08:25.640]  the ones that are dying first the ones that will go on the front lines and like you said what's left
[2:08:25.640 --> 2:08:32.600]  after that so you talk about a brain drain this is a a draining of the men absolutely and now
[2:08:32.600 --> 2:08:37.480]  they're bringing in men from from other cultures now and uh there aren't enough men in europe standing
[2:08:37.480 --> 2:08:44.520]  up to them so uh europe is being basically turned over to a new class of men who are far more aggressive
[2:08:44.520 --> 2:08:50.520]  than your average european man and uh and they have no problem taking what they want from europeans
[2:08:50.520 --> 2:08:53.880]  and particularly because let's just explain the men that couldn't fight are the only ones that
[2:08:53.880 --> 2:08:58.040]  didn't die and to a certain extent in russia as well i mean russians will tell you they had a
[2:08:58.040 --> 2:09:03.720]  major man drain after a deal like it was like well our bad-ass men are gone like they got killed
[2:09:03.720 --> 2:09:08.280]  by the germans the germans got killed by them what what a deal what a disaster what a fiasco
[2:09:08.280 --> 2:09:12.280]  i don't care what group of men they were but i mean you're sitting there literally talking about 40
[2:09:12.280 --> 2:09:20.920]  million dead people for no reason and now it's all about to happen again dan it's uh it's coming
[2:09:20.920 --> 2:09:26.040]  around the corner i mean we only lost what 500 000 i forget how many u.s troops died how many men
[2:09:26.040 --> 2:09:30.760]  died in world war two of the u.s something 500 600 000 i almost don't exist because both my
[2:09:30.760 --> 2:09:34.360]  grandfather's almost died in world war two the army air corps both of them almost died
[2:09:34.360 --> 2:09:39.960]  one in a crash landing and the other uh they they attacked their base in north africa so
[2:09:39.960 --> 2:09:45.160]  he was a captain he didn't fly on the next mission because he got uh wounded and then the plane blew
[2:09:45.160 --> 2:09:50.120]  up over idly and then he did his other missions and then you know like ran basic stuff every day
[2:09:50.120 --> 2:09:56.520]  22 missions or 22 missions but i mean imagine i mean imagine what that's like how many people
[2:09:56.520 --> 2:10:02.920]  don't exist in russia and germany because of that war yeah the fallout for generations so where does
[2:10:02.920 --> 2:10:10.040]  it all end is there any way out of this damn i'm not optimistic um i i do like to see certain things
[2:10:10.040 --> 2:10:14.440]  going on you know i do like to see some pushback and like i said what we've talked about going on
[2:10:14.440 --> 2:10:19.320]  in france and i and i do like to see that in a way in the united states things are slightly better
[2:10:19.320 --> 2:10:24.680]  than they are in the rest of the world specifically with the mask situation but i'm honestly not very
[2:10:24.680 --> 2:10:30.840]  optimistic i'm not either that's what i told my wife this morning and you know i'm not going to
[2:10:30.840 --> 2:10:35.160]  a lot of the listeners i'm not going to get up here and but see that's a catch 22 again going back
[2:10:35.160 --> 2:10:42.200]  to world war two i i'm almost speechless at this point we'll talk about this when we come back if
[2:10:42.200 --> 2:10:47.960]  we if we let them demoralize us and make us give up then they take over quicker but then if we don't
[2:10:47.960 --> 2:10:52.040]  just go into a defensive mode and pull back then we won't be prepared when everything collapses so
[2:10:52.040 --> 2:10:57.800]  it's it's a catch 22 totally agree well at least you're in the most stable area of europe aren't
[2:10:57.800 --> 2:11:02.920]  you it's uh it's it's quite nice not too bad and uh things are definitely crazier in the neighboring
[2:11:02.920 --> 2:11:07.960]  countries but uh i've spent a lot of time with some some swiss natives you know we you saw that hit
[2:11:07.960 --> 2:11:12.840]  we did in geneva with uh with new urban laden and some of the other folks there and uh you know had
[2:11:12.840 --> 2:11:16.760]  an opportunity to talk to them about you know the state of switzerland right now and they're in shock
[2:11:16.760 --> 2:11:21.560]  they're in shock to see you know how many people are compliant with with what's going on right now
[2:11:21.560 --> 2:11:25.720]  and uh and the direction things are going as you see here is is basically like a police state in
[2:11:25.720 --> 2:11:31.960]  genevo when uh when uh biden and putin came to town and uh free speech rights were stripped away
[2:11:31.960 --> 2:11:36.600]  there was by the way our crews doing a great i've been a great deal i don't know what's going on
[2:11:36.600 --> 2:11:41.640]  because i i thought i paid for everything to be wired by wires uh internal internets out so like
[2:11:41.640 --> 2:11:45.480]  nothing's working here so i'm not even sure we can play videos on air that's why i've been a little
[2:11:45.480 --> 2:11:51.080]  bit um flustered here because it seems like the more money i spend the worst things work around here
[2:11:51.080 --> 2:11:58.440]  but i i don't know what we're gonna do we may have to go back to vhs your voice counts when you
[2:11:58.440 --> 2:12:03.960]  share information be it over the internet or in person it changes the world the globalists know
[2:12:03.960 --> 2:12:09.640]  their agenda is unpopular they know you're angry and now to get around big tech it's more important

[2:12:56.200 --> 2:13:00.920]  the globalists are having their revolution but free humanity has to have its revolution
[2:13:01.640 --> 2:13:09.800]  we have to first recognize this anti-human takeovers trying to enslave the entire biological
[2:13:09.800 --> 2:13:15.560]  processes for humans and turn us into these artificial corporate controlled
[2:13:17.480 --> 2:13:22.680]  slaves worse than slaves so just just property from cradle to grave of the system
[2:13:23.800 --> 2:13:30.360]  rendered down to be servile minions of the system and a ritual of dominance and satanic
[2:13:30.360 --> 2:13:36.120]  control we have to recognize the great reset post-industrial world which realizes a nightmare
[2:13:36.120 --> 2:13:40.600]  dystopia and we have to promote liberty and freedom that is the opposite of their dystopia
[2:13:41.240 --> 2:13:46.840]  it's that choice it's that realization that's going to change the world and it's the only choice
[2:13:46.840 --> 2:13:52.280]  we've got freedom or slavery go to evil it is a spiritual battle and info wars at the tip of
[2:13:52.280 --> 2:13:58.600]  the spear fighting it x2 has been our number one bestseller over the years deep earth crystal

[2:14:50.360 --> 2:14:59.800]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:15:20.360 --> 2:15:24.760]  a final segment i got a ton of news i've got them in a cover in the last two segments before our
[2:15:24.760 --> 2:15:32.200]  next guest host takes over in the fourth hours a day but you went to biden's big european summit
[2:15:32.200 --> 2:15:38.920]  and it was a total police state amazing things that you posted at europewars.com you've seen the
[2:15:38.920 --> 2:15:45.080]  islamic invasion which i i've seen is intensifying yet again i mean you have witnessed so much in
[2:15:45.080 --> 2:15:49.400]  your years and years of reporting what else do you want to impart to the viewers and listeners out
[2:15:49.400 --> 2:15:57.160]  there dan well you know it's it's interesting to be in switzerland and it really is regarded as a
[2:15:57.160 --> 2:16:03.720]  bastion of freedom as far as europe goes and internationally of course and to see that there
[2:16:03.720 --> 2:16:09.560]  is no corner of the earth untouched from what is going on right now in terms of the the chaos and
[2:16:09.560 --> 2:16:14.600]  the tumult and this this insane medical tyranny that we're living under and you see it's seeping
[2:16:14.600 --> 2:16:19.720]  into switzerland and and and it's it's very disappointing because people look to places
[2:16:19.720 --> 2:16:25.240]  like that and a few other places at formerly new zealand as well as being kind of a place where
[2:16:25.240 --> 2:16:29.480]  maybe you could escape from from the madness of the world if you had an option to get in there but
[2:16:29.480 --> 2:16:33.400]  at this point there's nowhere to run there's nowhere to go people are just going to have to
[2:16:33.400 --> 2:16:39.720]  stand up and stand up to this this creeping tyranny that is creeping ever faster at this point
[2:16:39.720 --> 2:16:44.440]  because there's nowhere else to go that's what that's what i've kind of that conclusion that i've
[2:16:44.440 --> 2:16:49.320]  reached now at this point and i totally agree with you i just don't know why the average leftist buys
[2:16:49.320 --> 2:16:54.760]  into this pretending they're part of it again like some of this been kidnapped starts defending
[2:16:54.760 --> 2:16:59.320]  their captors when the stock home syndrome it really does seem like mass delusion how can you
[2:16:59.320 --> 2:17:05.800]  not see that globalist policies socialist policies communist policies are horrible i mean how would
[2:17:05.800 --> 2:17:11.480]  you want this how do they pretend because they're followers and so instead of admitting they're
[2:17:11.480 --> 2:17:16.200]  just slaves instead of just admitting they've been conned they just decide to go along with it and
[2:17:16.200 --> 2:17:20.360]  pretend they're part of it so i guess we have to stop worrying about them and just those of us that
[2:17:20.360 --> 2:17:23.880]  are thinkers and those of us that are stalwarts had realized that we want to be free it's the way
[2:17:23.880 --> 2:17:28.200]  the world's always been we're gonna have to declare independence and stand up for it and not comply
[2:17:28.760 --> 2:17:32.200]  we're gonna have to fight for it at this point you know that's our backs are up against the wall
[2:17:32.200 --> 2:17:37.560]  in terms of uh you know freedom being stripped away every single day and uh you know it's hanging
[2:17:37.560 --> 2:17:43.720]  by a thread at this point and again the globalists want to come in because they get power during an
[2:17:43.720 --> 2:17:50.840]  end of civil order the end of good law and order they get to have martial law they get to do what
[2:17:50.840 --> 2:17:58.120]  they want and it's really that lawlessness i mean it came out about lennon the secret police came
[2:17:58.120 --> 2:18:02.440]  back and this is their own writings and said we've got all the cities subdued all the towns no one
[2:18:02.440 --> 2:18:06.920]  is resisting everyone is gone and so can we stop killing and he said no i want you to kill even more
[2:18:06.920 --> 2:18:12.040]  just randomly enslave half the town kill 10 percent of them rape all the women and they said why
[2:18:12.040 --> 2:18:17.320]  and he said i want more blood i want more terror it's the red terror for a reason and he just enjoyed
[2:18:17.320 --> 2:18:23.960]  the thought of just murdering millions of villagers for fun so and then the left like worshiping
[2:18:23.960 --> 2:18:28.920]  i've had so many people ask me why are they doing this people who are starting to get it but they
[2:18:28.920 --> 2:18:34.520]  don't understand that the people who are executing this are totally total sociopaths they're totally
[2:18:34.520 --> 2:18:39.720]  demonic and they are reveling in this uh destruction of of civilization right now well
[2:18:39.720 --> 2:18:44.040]  trump said if they kick me out your gas prices will explode they're up by 40 because they're
[2:18:44.040 --> 2:18:49.480]  scamming us i mean to fit every level absolutely we see it at the southern border the scam there
[2:18:49.480 --> 2:18:55.320]  you know we have uh an an open southern border there anyone that wants to come in come in no
[2:18:55.320 --> 2:18:59.480]  problem but me as an american citizen when i come in i have to go through all the rigamarole
[2:18:59.480 --> 2:19:04.440]  to enter my own country which is fine if everyone else had because that's because you're a middle
[2:19:04.440 --> 2:19:10.280]  class law abiding person that they know they need to keep in line you're being given prisoner training
[2:19:11.320 --> 2:19:14.920]  somebody already coming out of latin america that's basically a slave they want them because
[2:19:14.920 --> 2:19:20.520]  they're going to fit right in you know i was uh at customs and border protection coming into the
[2:19:20.520 --> 2:19:24.440]  country and there was a woman in front of me and she was from paraguay apparently she didn't speak
[2:19:24.440 --> 2:19:29.160]  a word of english she held up her phone with a pre-printed message to the uh the border guard
[2:19:29.160 --> 2:19:34.040]  and he basically was very sweet with her and very nice and basically i don't even know if he checked
[2:19:34.040 --> 2:19:38.600]  her passport to be honest he didn't put her through any of any of the uh the song and dance and then i
[2:19:38.600 --> 2:19:43.400]  came up next as an american citizen i had to take the mask off have a photograph taken of me had to
[2:19:43.400 --> 2:19:47.320]  ask where i was coming from where i was going why i was in the country what was my business there in
[2:19:47.320 --> 2:19:52.280]  my own country and it was interesting to be that juxtaposition watching you know how that did you
[2:19:52.280 --> 2:19:56.840]  ask him why did you not ask her any questions or scan her because you know she has no idea
[2:19:57.640 --> 2:20:01.400]  but but it's because i comply you're going to rape the hell out of me yeah exactly
[2:20:04.360 --> 2:20:08.920]  don't these people understand that are complying that it's going to destroy them in the end i think
[2:20:08.920 --> 2:20:13.960]  a lot of them don't and even if they do it's like it's like a suicide cult they don't care they're
[2:20:13.960 --> 2:20:19.720]  happy to go down the drain as long as they all go together the npc meme is stronger than ever
[2:20:19.720 --> 2:20:26.600]  there are a lot of npcs out there what is the worst thing they do i mean i would have to say
[2:20:26.600 --> 2:20:32.840]  it's suppressing people that die of the covid vaccine and that is so and are suppressing medical
[2:20:32.840 --> 2:20:37.720]  treatments they know are basically 99 effective that's evil and i think what they're doing to the
[2:20:37.720 --> 2:20:43.560]  children is what really bothers me the most you know i see so many children now in very young
[2:20:44.120 --> 2:20:48.680]  where masks are optional and sometimes even their parents aren't wearing a mask the children are
[2:20:48.680 --> 2:20:53.560]  wearing a mask because they've been so conditioned into it and they're so psychologically damaged
[2:20:53.560 --> 2:20:58.760]  yeah nobody's saying your body's good other people's are when we interface with each other
[2:20:59.320 --> 2:21:02.280]  you know that makes us all stronger no they're being taught they're dirty everybody else is
[2:21:02.280 --> 2:21:06.120]  dirty and they're scared to death yeah i mean they are breaking down human interaction at this
[2:21:06.120 --> 2:21:10.360]  point there's going to be an entire generation of kids who grew up looking at other people
[2:21:10.360 --> 2:21:14.280]  everyone wearing a mask all the time and they're and they're constantly in fear you know i've
[2:21:14.280 --> 2:21:18.600]  been told by people who have small children that their friends talk to them they have their kids
[2:21:18.600 --> 2:21:23.400]  are waking up in the middle of the night with nightmares about masks and about covid and fear
[2:21:23.400 --> 2:21:27.640]  and so you have this entire generation of kids who are going to be totally damaged by this whole
[2:21:27.640 --> 2:21:33.960]  thing you know i started having a nightmare a month ago almost every night where it's like babies
[2:21:33.960 --> 2:21:38.440]  with screams hooked on their faces programming and i'm like why am i having this dream so that
[2:21:38.440 --> 2:21:43.080]  dreams have come true uh and it has that feel of some of the dreams you know that have come
[2:21:43.080 --> 2:21:47.320]  to like i saw the tower smoking i talked about before it happened um this is one of those dreams
[2:21:47.320 --> 2:21:52.440]  and then now they've announced it's uh this is the end video that greg rhesus did that the main
[2:21:52.440 --> 2:21:56.280]  people running DARPA and everything want at birth babies to be fitted with these things
[2:21:56.280 --> 2:22:00.760]  for cultural intervention to teach them how to be white is the main excuse seriously if you're
[2:22:00.760 --> 2:22:05.560]  against hooking a thing on a baby to brainwash it and then scan it then you're a white supremacist
[2:22:05.560 --> 2:22:10.680]  but they want to have medical interventions at birth and hook children up with goggles and when
[2:22:10.680 --> 2:22:14.920]  i saw the goggles and what they're planning i was like my god that's in my dream so it's just i don't
[2:22:14.920 --> 2:22:19.720]  know man it's just weird yeah you had yeah the uh the the nba finals right now are being sponsored
[2:22:19.720 --> 2:22:25.080]  by oculus oculus is one of those apparatuses that people are being conditioned to be just have the
[2:22:25.080 --> 2:22:29.320]  have a screen strapped to their face at this point so i mean that is definitely sounds very
[2:22:29.320 --> 2:22:33.960]  possible and uh and kids are already have screens strapped to their faces essentially you go to any
[2:22:33.960 --> 2:22:37.960]  restaurant and with those kids and they're all just glued to the screens and parents are very
[2:22:37.960 --> 2:22:41.560]  very comfortable just putting their kids in front of a screen because it makes parenting easier

[2:28:17.560 --> 2:28:23.000]  we're a rat tag organization but i've got the best crew i've ever had and i love them and i
[2:28:23.000 --> 2:28:28.760]  appreciate them because they gotta run this show with uh mid-grade equipment that still cost millions
[2:28:28.760 --> 2:28:34.200]  and millions and millions of dollars you understand that like a fox news has hundreds of millions of
[2:28:34.200 --> 2:28:38.440]  dollars of equipment we have tens of millions of dollars of equipment when you got your own
[2:28:38.440 --> 2:28:43.240]  satellites and your own decoders and your own this and your own that i mean it's it's like a
[2:28:43.240 --> 2:28:48.920]  frickin space shuttle on steroids around here and the fact that they can run this place is amazing
[2:28:48.920 --> 2:28:55.320]  and i appreciate them like a little bitchy sometimes it's because i'm a man and you know
[2:28:55.320 --> 2:29:00.680]  if my neighbor for no reason say slap my daughter upside the head i'm gonna go over there and tear
[2:29:00.680 --> 2:29:07.480]  his door off his hand just to beat his brains out my neighbors are nice though that's not gonna
[2:29:07.480 --> 2:29:15.320]  need to happen but these globalists are doing this legally and scientifically through these
[2:29:15.320 --> 2:29:21.080]  agreements they've gotten but just because hitler passes a law or just because uh alabama passes a
[2:29:21.080 --> 2:29:27.560]  law that's saying black people aren't human you know 200 years ago doesn't mean it's true so just
[2:29:27.560 --> 2:29:33.240]  because claus schwaub and bill gates say they can do all this they can't and so i've been praying every
[2:29:33.240 --> 2:29:39.080]  day to not have rage because it'll end up making me have a heart attack okay so when i tell you i
[2:29:39.080 --> 2:29:46.680]  mean i take some time off um it's not me being a wimp everybody says take time off i'm gonna have
[2:29:46.680 --> 2:29:54.200]  to take a week off or something and actually just go to the mountains uh because it's not just that
[2:29:54.200 --> 2:29:58.360]  i'm pissed it's the urgency and i know you're feeling it as well that we've got to do something and i
[2:29:58.360 --> 2:30:07.800]  don't know what that is i just know this really bad people are taken over and they're playing us
[2:30:07.800 --> 2:30:13.640]  off against each other and of the people and the public just knew like christ said the people perish
[2:30:13.640 --> 2:30:19.480]  for lack of knowledge if they just knew how they were being screwed they would notice say no to this
[2:30:19.480 --> 2:30:26.200]  and not comply but they sell it like because they know the average person's good like oh the hospitals
[2:30:26.200 --> 2:30:32.280]  are full everyone's dying please stay indoors so it doesn't spread so that we can keep the hospitals
[2:30:32.280 --> 2:30:38.920]  open when they shut them all down on purpose they were totally empty and oh just take the shot be a
[2:30:38.920 --> 2:30:43.720]  hero that way things can just go back to normal when it's in all their actuaries and all their
[2:30:43.720 --> 2:30:51.160]  admissions that it's never going back to normal and that's what makes me mad is claus schwaub who
[2:30:51.160 --> 2:30:56.040]  runs this whole thing with gates he sits up there and says we have them we will never go back to
[2:30:56.040 --> 2:31:02.520]  normal now we have habituated them new lockdowns coming and then i get up here and tell you that
[2:31:02.520 --> 2:31:10.760]  you're like god how'd you know that they said they were going to do it and that's what pisses me off
[2:31:10.760 --> 2:31:20.520]  is that this is so transparent this is so out in the open but here's the here's the paradox
[2:31:22.120 --> 2:31:25.880]  when you lived in a really free country like america that's got its problems but compared
[2:31:25.880 --> 2:31:32.680]  to others it's it's amazing what you can do how much you can succeed in the choices you have it's
[2:31:32.680 --> 2:31:40.280]  ridiculous i mean if you want to go jet skiing in cuba you can't if you want to go
[2:31:41.240 --> 2:31:47.160]  water skiing you can't if you want to go see a doctor about your skin you can't if you want to
[2:31:47.160 --> 2:31:50.360]  go to a college and get a degree in this you can't they tell you what you can get a degree in
[2:31:50.360 --> 2:31:56.440]  they don't have any freedom but i'll tell you this the average cuban hates the government
[2:31:57.160 --> 2:32:03.720]  knows it's all bs and totally sees through it so at least they're not naive like we are
[2:32:07.400 --> 2:32:14.280]  but to watch the establishment trying to sell us on what they've done to other countries
[2:32:14.280 --> 2:32:21.880]  because it's beyond wanting to be a movie star it's beyond wanting to be in charge it's about
[2:32:21.880 --> 2:32:26.600]  power never seen the movie the lives of others a composite of true stories of what happened
[2:32:27.560 --> 2:32:34.520]  in the stasi surveillance of east germany which is nothing compared to now and the woman
[2:32:35.080 --> 2:32:41.480]  who's married to the man she's an actress and just to make money for food she's got to go have sex
[2:32:41.480 --> 2:32:48.600]  with the communist on a routine basis or she doesn't even get to be in the approved communist play
[2:32:53.560 --> 2:33:01.720]  and and i mean that's what this is is your wife's gonna have to have sex with the local
[2:33:01.720 --> 2:33:08.040]  commie just for baby food but in a free market there'd be so much money and so much freedom
[2:33:08.040 --> 2:33:14.360]  that you your wife would never even imagine having sex with somebody so she can keep her job to have
[2:33:14.360 --> 2:33:23.160]  baby food and that's what this is about is about humiliation and taking people's respect away and
[2:33:23.160 --> 2:33:29.320]  it's disgusting and the scum that runs systems like this get off on dominating and humiliating people
[2:33:30.920 --> 2:33:33.960]  and here's what happens once authoritarianism takes over
[2:33:33.960 --> 2:33:39.240]  it takes generations to get out of it sometimes you never get out of it
[2:33:41.000 --> 2:33:42.360]  and we're going that way right now
[2:33:47.480 --> 2:33:54.280]  so i want you to know who's coming for your health and your life and your pension and and your
[2:33:54.280 --> 2:34:01.160]  your very existence he said you're not essential his name's claus swab i say out of his own mouth
[2:34:01.160 --> 2:34:07.880]  he's cursed himself just like ramsey's the second dead to moses when he cursed moses
[2:34:08.600 --> 2:34:14.920]  moses said you in exodus you have cursed yourself out of your own mouth
[2:34:17.400 --> 2:34:23.880]  claus swab is not essential claus swab will be destroyed
[2:34:23.880 --> 2:34:34.520]  watch and pray for it and let pray for god to do it and god's elegant perfect way not in our way
[2:34:35.560 --> 2:34:42.600]  but pray for judgment on claus swab and promise god that you're going to be upright and strong
[2:34:42.600 --> 2:34:49.640]  and have courage but pray for god to remove the scourge of claus swab from our backs
[2:34:49.640 --> 2:35:00.600]  here's a young lady from cuba able to get a quick video out named dylan who has family in the states
[2:35:01.800 --> 2:35:06.200]  in english explaining to you what's really happening in cuba because you know fouchy and
[2:35:06.200 --> 2:35:11.960]  and biden and all them are saying oh the people are just mad because of covet uh no uh here she is
[2:35:12.760 --> 2:35:16.520]  i'm gonna speak in english about what's going on in cuba because i don't hear a lot of
[2:35:16.520 --> 2:35:20.440]  english speakers talking about this and my generation talking about this cuba has been under
[2:35:20.440 --> 2:35:29.000]  dictatorship for 62 years so people for naturally for the last 62 years since 1960s and 1958 around
[2:35:29.000 --> 2:35:34.920]  there people started making homemade boats that we call lancas and have bringing them to the coast
[2:35:34.920 --> 2:35:39.720]  of florida seeking shelter let me explain to you why because you might be saying well they're just
[2:35:39.720 --> 2:35:44.680]  immigrants invading because they want to leave the home country no it's because us cubans we
[2:35:44.680 --> 2:35:51.080]  don't complain about anything it takes a lot for us to complain and this i'm sick and tired of it
[2:35:51.080 --> 2:35:55.640]  so let me tell you what's going on there's no coffins for dead bodies if you have a dead family
[2:35:55.640 --> 2:36:00.520]  member they get pronounced dead they get wrapped in a bed sheet you get you get you get delivered
[2:36:00.520 --> 2:36:05.400]  the dead body and you have to take it home with you what you do with the body they don't care
[2:36:05.400 --> 2:36:08.520]  you have to figure it out if you don't have a car they don't provide transportation and you
[2:36:08.520 --> 2:36:14.920]  have to take the dead body home walking there's no drinking water food costs 200 us dollars a pound
[2:36:14.920 --> 2:36:20.040]  of rice costs 200 us dollars you don't want to know how much a 10 pound one costs my favorite part
[2:36:21.080 --> 2:36:26.120]  canadian dollars is the currency of cuba right now if you don't have family here in the united
[2:36:26.120 --> 2:36:32.920]  states to give you money you have to figure it out you have to figure it out because the only way
[2:36:32.920 --> 2:36:38.760]  you can get money in cuba is if you get a sense to you by here oh and here it takes months to get
[2:36:38.760 --> 2:36:45.720]  to cuba they shut off their light and water at seven as soon as the sun goes down your electricity
[2:36:45.720 --> 2:36:50.840]  gets shut internet is shut right now worldwide on cuba that's why we're not getting any new news
[2:36:50.840 --> 2:36:55.080]  but we have family there all everybody's out on the streets right now just the same way they were
[2:36:55.080 --> 2:36:59.320]  yesterday they're out on the street right now there's no medication there's no ad build there's no
[2:36:59.320 --> 2:37:05.960]  antibiotics there's no butterfly butterfly needles there's no ivy's there's nothing there's nothing
[2:37:05.960 --> 2:37:13.560]  and now is when people are hearing the screams out of cuba i'm sick and tired of this dictatorship
[2:37:13.560 --> 2:37:20.520]  and my whole life when we visited cuba you could not say a word against the government but now i
[2:37:20.520 --> 2:37:29.000]  can go to my country and say the economy single the regimen so i got that backwards she's that family
[2:37:29.000 --> 2:37:33.480]  in cuba she's out of cuba right now but just that's what we're all going on except the medical
[2:37:33.480 --> 2:37:37.720]  tyranny where they come and inject you with a poison till you slowly die and bill gate says he
[2:37:37.720 --> 2:37:42.600]  wants to kill you i mean it's here folks the rest of the world's like this we're about to be the same
[2:37:42.600 --> 2:37:51.400]  way so we better do something now all the games are over all the funding games are over
[2:37:53.320 --> 2:37:58.920]  so we have free shipping double patriot points through this weekend and our big loss leader is

[2:39:18.600 --> 2:39:24.760]  living defense brought me back i wanted to just quote from the bible jesus is saying as to where
[2:39:24.760 --> 2:39:32.840]  we are right now this is matthew 24 verse 9 then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall
[2:39:32.840 --> 2:39:39.960]  kill you and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake and then shall many be offended and
[2:39:39.960 --> 2:39:44.760]  shall betray one another and shall hate one another that's right where we're at brother
[2:39:44.760 --> 2:39:49.480]  and that's because god's name is on the founding of this country no matter what they say and that's
[2:39:49.480 --> 2:39:57.080]  why the enemy hates it because god created this country i preach about the dangers of cell phones
[2:39:57.080 --> 2:40:01.880]  all day long because they're super computers controlled by big tech that are spying on us

[2:41:58.680 --> 2:42:19.240]  jones show the answer to 1984 answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:42:19.240 --> 2:42:25.640]  when we went to war with the british crown in 1776 it was because they were pulling all sorts of
[2:42:25.640 --> 2:42:33.400]  scams where you weren't even allowed to buy stuff at a grocery store basically a supply house unless
[2:42:33.400 --> 2:42:39.800]  you were a british lord so you had to go through them or their representative to even be able to
[2:42:39.800 --> 2:42:46.760]  buy anything a firearm horseshoes if you wanted to make whiskey you couldn't do it they'd come
[2:42:46.760 --> 2:42:52.360]  and burn your farm down and they take you and lock you up for a couple weeks in stocks with
[2:42:52.360 --> 2:42:56.680]  your head and arms through it uh till a lot of times most people will get really sick a lot of them
[2:42:56.680 --> 2:43:01.560]  would die see you look at what cuba does and think oh that's terrible well that was going all over
[2:43:01.560 --> 2:43:05.640]  the world and england was seen as a freer country compared to other places they were worse
[2:43:07.880 --> 2:43:12.600]  and it's still like that all over the world in many other places and that's why the globalists
[2:43:12.600 --> 2:43:17.160]  want us to be like other places north korea cuba because they're all above the law they're never
[2:43:17.160 --> 2:43:22.680]  going to be in that place and they don't like seeing you with a nice house and a swimming pool
[2:43:22.680 --> 2:43:27.400]  and going where you want and doing what you want and going and buying five pounds of rice for three
[2:43:27.400 --> 2:43:33.960]  dollars or five dollars they want to make you pay three hundred four hundred dollars for a five
[2:43:33.960 --> 2:43:41.160]  pound bag of rice because the communists live like kings while you starve and they use the fact
[2:43:41.160 --> 2:43:47.960]  that you're so poor to control you that you're busy eating bugs while they're eating filet mignon
[2:43:49.800 --> 2:43:54.520]  and so again our system is bad because it creates spoiled brats that are dumb enough
[2:43:54.520 --> 2:44:00.520]  to get conned by communists to go back into it but see if you're from that and you know how bad
[2:44:00.520 --> 2:44:05.960]  it is oh no biden said we don't want any cubans you're not welcome here because you're coming from
[2:44:05.960 --> 2:44:17.080]  a real regime where you get put in prison for your speech oh but if you're a mother unaccompanied
[2:44:17.080 --> 2:44:22.200]  with children we can induct you into our system and milk the welfare off of you
[2:44:23.960 --> 2:44:28.920]  so that's where it's going folks to collapse the civilization but here's the good news
[2:44:28.920 --> 2:44:36.920]  God works in mysterious ways and for all the evil things that are going on
[2:44:38.200 --> 2:44:41.720]  good is going to be counteracting that and that's why we have to be that good
[2:44:41.720 --> 2:44:47.560]  in the world would be the change of the world that we're looking for and it's just that simple
[2:44:48.440 --> 2:44:54.280]  and people have to start recognizing that we are two minutes from midnight and in many areas the
[2:44:54.280 --> 2:45:00.120]  collapse has already happened and it's all being orchestrated politically by the globalist they
[2:45:00.120 --> 2:45:05.000]  are orchestrating a post-industrial world what does a post-industrial world mean
[2:45:07.080 --> 2:45:13.960]  means a post-industrial world means no medicine no electricity no food that's what they want
[2:45:14.920 --> 2:45:16.760]  and when you're in chelchescu's romanium
[2:45:16.760 --> 2:45:24.120]  or you were in stalin's russia or you were in one of those places or you were in kuba today
[2:45:25.240 --> 2:45:29.720]  the government buildings have light the government facilities all have light
[2:45:31.400 --> 2:45:38.040]  they've all got money they've all got food they've all got caviar while you go hungry and your stomach
[2:45:38.040 --> 2:45:50.360]  hurts even though you just work 12 hours and that's how this works now i want to show you a
[2:45:50.360 --> 2:45:59.480]  time lapse if you're a tv viewer radio listeners i will give you an aeration of a scientific
[2:46:00.120 --> 2:46:06.760]  time lapse of the supposed tectonic plates in the last billion years i'm not going to debate
[2:46:06.760 --> 2:46:13.160]  whether the earth's 10 000 years old a week old or a trillion years old but we do know from geology
[2:46:14.200 --> 2:46:19.320]  that there are parts of africa that fit perfectly into latin america and vice versa in europe where
[2:46:19.320 --> 2:46:25.240]  it is the same rock it is the same dirt and we know that these pieces were once connected to each
[2:46:25.240 --> 2:46:32.440]  other and are floating around on giant tectonic plates on top of lava so if you're a tv viewer
[2:46:32.440 --> 2:46:37.880]  you can see a billion year time lapse now whether this just happened the last million years the last
[2:46:37.880 --> 2:46:42.840]  six thousand years open for debate but geology including geologists in my family about different
[2:46:42.840 --> 2:46:48.200]  parts of the world and they've seen right where the exact same rock the exact same breakdown
[2:46:49.480 --> 2:46:54.760]  is in one part of the world 3000 miles away and is across the ocean another area perfectly
[2:46:54.760 --> 2:47:01.720]  fitting together so we do know at one point the earth was the way they've just shown in this
[2:47:01.720 --> 2:47:07.160]  artist uh computerized rendering watched one million years of tectonic plate movement in just 40
[2:47:07.160 --> 2:47:12.600]  seconds and we'll link that up on info wars dot com as well this is zero hedge dot com
[2:47:12.600 --> 2:47:17.400]  with a great job they're doing but my point is we're only here for a flash what matters is what
[2:47:17.400 --> 2:47:22.920]  we do before god this is all a big test until you see evil winning and you see evil triumphing
[2:47:22.920 --> 2:47:27.480]  and you see the fbi protecting pedophiles that came out the news today with the rape of 70 girls
[2:47:27.480 --> 2:47:33.160]  covering it up you see all that it makes you angry but you got to know they're the losers that signed
[2:47:33.160 --> 2:47:37.880]  on the state they're the people that bought into their five minutes of fame with evil
[2:47:38.600 --> 2:47:44.760]  and whose soul was compromised don't see that and think god's forsaken as god gave us free will
[2:47:44.760 --> 2:47:52.600]  but most people that want power have sold out to satan and just remember whatever lie they're
[2:47:52.600 --> 2:47:57.080]  telling you today they're going to change tomorrow they legitimately thought of the 60s and 70s the
[2:47:57.080 --> 2:48:02.440]  new ice age was coming because they believe it's on 12 000 year cycles and we do know they do happen
[2:48:03.240 --> 2:48:06.760]  and some spots had gotten down and things were cooling off a little bit so they thought it was
[2:48:06.760 --> 2:48:11.720]  freezing the truth is the only thing that changes is the weather it goes up it goes down the earth
[2:48:11.720 --> 2:48:17.800]  is always in change anybody that tells you that they know all the answers in the liar anybody
[2:48:17.800 --> 2:48:23.160]  that tells you the earth won't be here in 10 years so let me run your life i'm aoc they just want
[2:48:23.160 --> 2:48:27.640]  you to give up and be apocalyptic so that was my paradox today that i meant to get into a dan
[2:48:27.640 --> 2:48:33.320]  lineman but we never did and maybe i'll do a whole show on this tomorrow because i'm really torn on
[2:48:33.320 --> 2:48:39.960]  this point the globalists are creating dystopia they're taking over they're annihilating things
[2:48:39.960 --> 2:48:45.000]  they're creating the collapse and then saying it's global warming and saying it's climate change
[2:48:45.000 --> 2:48:49.640]  when they're the ones with the global lockdown that has initiated this so i'm not saying the
[2:48:49.640 --> 2:48:54.520]  engineer because i want it to be or because it should be it's because they're orchestrating a
[2:48:54.520 --> 2:49:02.520]  organized control collapse which then they claim is naturally occurring because we ate too much
[2:49:02.520 --> 2:49:07.960]  red meat or had a car or an air conditioning and obama goes to african says you can't have a car
[2:49:07.960 --> 2:49:11.720]  you can't have air conditioning is a global warming that's all based on fraud but even
[2:49:11.720 --> 2:49:19.560]  if he was right that he shouldn't own giant mansions and in 40 000 square foot homes and jets and
[2:49:19.560 --> 2:49:24.920]  helicopters while he tells africans because you're an african you don't get air conditioning or a car
[2:49:24.920 --> 2:49:31.080]  what the hell is that and then he lectures me how i'm a racist real racism is saying people don't
[2:49:31.080 --> 2:49:37.560]  have access to jobs and to energy and to a way of life i want to see everybody raised up not put
[2:49:37.560 --> 2:49:45.960]  people down so i could be above them so that's how this works ladies and gentlemen they're using
[2:49:45.960 --> 2:49:52.360]  climate change as their excuse for destabilization and takeover but here's lynard nemoi the late
[2:49:52.360 --> 2:50:00.040]  great lynard nemoi back in the 1970s warning on national tv about imminent global cooling and just
[2:50:00.760 --> 2:50:02.840]  think about that for a minute next time they're fear mongering
[2:50:02.840 --> 2:50:10.520]  five million years it has advanced and retreated with clockwork regularity if we are unprepared
[2:50:10.520 --> 2:50:16.280]  for the next advance the result could be hunger and death on a scale unprecedented in all of history
[2:50:17.160 --> 2:50:20.680]  what scientists are telling you let's start it over let's just start it over start it over let's
[2:50:20.680 --> 2:50:25.080]  help people to hear the very first what he said so let's get our audio files up let's prepare
[2:50:25.080 --> 2:50:31.960]  learning one at least eight times in the past million years it has advanced and retreated
[2:50:31.960 --> 2:50:37.880]  with clockwork regularity if we are unprepared for the next advance the result could be hunger
[2:50:37.880 --> 2:50:43.960]  and death on a scale unprecedented in all of history what scientists are telling us now
[2:50:43.960 --> 2:50:49.640]  is that the threat of an ice age is not as remote as they once thought during the lifetime of our
[2:50:49.640 --> 2:50:56.360]  grandchildren arctic cold and perpetual snow could turn most of the inhabitable portions of our
[2:50:56.360 --> 2:51:06.520]  planet into a polar desert in 1977 the worst winter in a century struck the united states
[2:51:11.160 --> 2:51:13.880]  arctic cold ripped the midwest for weeks on end
[2:51:13.880 --> 2:51:22.600]  great blizzards paralyzed cities of the northeast one desperate night in buffalo eight people
[2:51:22.600 --> 2:51:27.480]  froze to death in marine columns that bushnell was on the road that night
[2:51:28.120 --> 2:51:33.160]  traffic just absolutely stopped i was afraid of being stuck in the car all night long
[2:51:33.800 --> 2:51:40.840]  with the uh cold and the wind running out of gas and then what i think that if we had to go through
[2:51:40.840 --> 2:51:48.120]  a real bad winter just like we just went through i think we have to think about moving someplace
[2:51:48.120 --> 2:51:55.480]  south mood where the brutal buffalo winter might become common all over the united states
[2:51:56.200 --> 2:52:02.840]  climate experts believe the next ice age is on its way according to recent evidence it could come
[2:52:02.840 --> 2:52:12.680]  sooner than anyone had expected and weather stations in the far north temperatures have
[2:52:12.680 --> 2:52:20.360]  been dropping for 30 years sea coasts long free of summer ice are now blocked year-round
[2:52:22.040 --> 2:52:28.200]  according to some climatologists within a lifetime we might be living in the next ice age
[2:52:28.200 --> 2:52:36.280]  of the nine planets in our solar system only earth has conditions favorable to human life
[2:52:43.320 --> 2:52:49.560]  x2 has been our number one bestseller over the years deep earth crystal iodine the good halogen
[2:52:49.560 --> 2:52:54.760]  it is essential for all actions in the body you must have it to live the un estimates two
[2:52:54.760 --> 2:52:59.000]  billion plus people have cognitive disabilities because they don't have a divide i we have x2
[2:52:59.000 --> 2:53:03.240]  at two different bottles the same amount in each bottle but one has a spray top one has a dropper
[2:53:03.240 --> 2:53:10.120]  top 60 off on the spray top 40 off on the dropper top for a limited time because they're both
[2:53:10.120 --> 2:53:14.280]  selling out i want to thank all the supporters that have got me over the years they're amazing
[2:53:14.280 --> 2:53:18.600]  so that's a great deal for you to stock up on it but this deal is really for folks that have been
[2:53:18.600 --> 2:53:23.640]  on the fence and haven't experienced the good halogen for yourself so x2 the dropper bottle
[2:53:23.640 --> 2:53:28.440]  and the spray bottle 60 and 40 percent off for a limited time because it's selling out right now

[2:53:48.360 --> 2:53:54.440]  but for humanity has to have its revolution we have to first recognize this anti-human
[2:53:55.400 --> 2:54:03.000]  takeovers trying to enslave the entire biological processes of humans and turn us into these
[2:54:03.000 --> 2:54:12.280]  artificial corporate controlled slaves worsted slaves so just just property from cradle to
[2:54:12.280 --> 2:54:20.200]  grave of the system rendered down to be servile minions of the system and a ritual of dominance
[2:54:20.200 --> 2:54:25.640]  and safety and control we have to recognize their great reset post-industrial world which
[2:54:25.640 --> 2:54:30.200]  realizes a nightmare dystopia and we have to promote liberty and freedom that is the opposite
[2:54:30.200 --> 2:54:34.760]  of their dystopia it's that choice it's that realization that's going to change the world
[2:54:35.800 --> 2:54:41.560]  and it's the only choice we've got freedom or slavery go to reval it is a spiritual battle
[2:54:41.560 --> 2:54:43.480]  and info wars at the tip of the spear fighting it
[2:54:43.480 --> 2:55:13.320]  you're listening to the alex jones show

[2:56:00.680 --> 2:56:09.240]  democide coined by a us professor in hawaii decades ago it's a concept proposed by us political
[2:56:09.240 --> 2:56:16.440]  scientists rudolf rumel to describe the intentional killing of an unarmed and disarmed person by
[2:56:16.440 --> 2:56:21.560]  government agents acting in their authoritative capacity and pursuant to government policy
[2:56:21.560 --> 2:56:27.640]  on high command forced labor concentration camp victims killings by unofficial private groups
[2:56:27.640 --> 2:56:31.480]  extraditional summary killings and mass death secret experimentation part of it
[2:56:31.480 --> 2:56:37.480]  due to governmental acts of criminal omission and neglect such as deliberate famines as well
[2:56:37.480 --> 2:56:43.880]  as killings by the facto governments i.e civil war the definition covers any murder by any
[2:56:45.320 --> 2:56:52.840]  number of persons by any government and that's what the global lockdown has all been about
[2:56:52.840 --> 2:56:57.640]  already caused more than 20 million people to starve to death on top of who already would die each

[3:00:59.560 --> 3:01:11.000]  alex jones with mike adams all right welcome to the fourth hour of today's broadcast on info
[3:01:11.000 --> 3:01:16.840]  wars dot com i'm mike adams filling in for i think matt bracken usually has this segment and
[3:01:18.120 --> 3:01:25.000]  uh it it was by the grace of god that i was asked to fill in today because i'm just on the verge
[3:01:25.000 --> 3:01:31.080]  of breaking a major investigative story that i'm just going to lay out for you here verbally
[3:01:31.080 --> 3:01:36.440]  even though i haven't completely written it up but i've sent over some links to the info wars
[3:01:36.440 --> 3:01:40.920]  crew there we're going to be able to show you the evidence for what this is now this is one of those
[3:01:40.920 --> 3:01:46.680]  connect the dots kinds of stories and it has everything to do with what you've heard today
[3:01:46.680 --> 3:01:53.240]  about covet about south africa about engineered collapse food scarcity door to door vaccines
[3:01:53.880 --> 3:02:00.200]  and a strike force teams that are now using coercion and they're carrying jabs with them now
[3:02:00.200 --> 3:02:08.360]  to vaccinate you on site in in your doorway uh if if you give them permission to do so so uh this
[3:02:08.360 --> 3:02:16.120]  is a bombshell story and you are going to be more horrified than usual when you reach the
[3:02:16.120 --> 3:02:20.840]  conclusion of the start let me just get right into it because what's coming is going to be
[3:02:22.200 --> 3:02:28.200]  a little shocking here's where we start with this according to the cdc today this is their
[3:02:28.200 --> 3:02:34.520]  their official numbers 48 percent of the us population of all ages 48 percent are quote
[3:02:34.520 --> 3:02:40.600]  fully vaccinated that means two doses so that's again almost half the population fully vaccinated
[3:02:41.160 --> 3:02:48.600]  184 million people or about 56 percent of the population have had at least one dose
[3:02:49.720 --> 3:02:54.040]  now whether or not you believe those numbers that's fine uh i they're probably exaggerating
[3:02:54.040 --> 3:02:59.320]  these numbers i agree but let's just take them at their word for the sake of this thought experiment
[3:02:59.320 --> 3:03:05.960]  now 184 million americans if they've been vaccinated with at least one dose of this vaccine that means
[3:03:05.960 --> 3:03:12.440]  184 million americans have been injected with either spike protein biological weapon engineered
[3:03:12.440 --> 3:03:18.760]  in the uhan institute of virology laboratory using us taxpayer money funneled by eco health
[3:03:18.760 --> 3:03:24.520]  alliance and fauci and so on they built a bio weapon they injected you either with that weapon
[3:03:24.520 --> 3:03:31.400]  directly or with mrna instructions which is really a gene altering technology a nano technology
[3:03:32.280 --> 3:03:37.560]  that instructs your body to manufacture biological weapons and circulate them around your blood
[3:03:37.560 --> 3:03:46.680]  and spread them to other people so according to many prominent doctors and analysts including
[3:03:46.680 --> 3:03:52.360]  dr hoffey dr martin and many of the other voices that you've heard here as guests on info wars dot
[3:03:52.360 --> 3:04:03.960]  com uh more than half of these 184 million americans will likely be dead in the next few years more than
[3:04:03.960 --> 3:04:12.280]  half in other words the majority of them will likely be dead this means if you just do the math
[3:04:12.280 --> 3:04:19.080]  about half of that 184 million that the cdc says have been vaccinated half is about 92 million
[3:04:19.080 --> 3:04:27.480]  so let's go with that number what happens if 92 million americans are killed by these vaccines
[3:04:28.200 --> 3:04:35.880]  over the next few years as the micro blood clots kick in and as people suffer from congestive
[3:04:35.880 --> 3:04:42.680]  heart failure due to the blood clots the autoimmune disorders and the antibody dependent enhancement
[3:04:42.680 --> 3:04:50.600]  okay which is the hyper inflammatory reaction to subsequent infections so what happens to america
[3:04:50.600 --> 3:04:56.200]  well let's talk next about delta remember we're going to connect a lot of dots here today this
[3:04:56.200 --> 3:05:02.760]  is going to span several segments of the show here so so make sure you tune in to each segment
[3:05:02.760 --> 3:05:07.560]  for this hour and i will wrap it all together for you next we're going to go to a news story
[3:05:07.560 --> 3:05:12.680]  and this story happens to be out of israel where they've done this research the website
[3:05:12.680 --> 3:05:22.680]  is israelnationalnews.com and it says that out of 7700 new cases of the virus that have been
[3:05:23.320 --> 3:05:32.120]  detected during the delta wave only 72 of those cases happened in people who were known to have
[3:05:32.120 --> 3:05:38.440]  been infected previously and had natural immunity in other words less than one percent of the delta
[3:05:38.440 --> 3:05:45.400]  cases are occurring in people who have natural immunity less than one percent but 40 percent
[3:05:45.400 --> 3:05:51.960]  of those new cases are happening in people who have been previously vaccinated you got that
[3:05:53.080 --> 3:05:59.960]  so in other words if you've been vaccinated against covid you are far more likely to become
[3:05:59.960 --> 3:06:07.160]  hospitalized and sick and infected by the delta variant okay and you you you know about all of the
[3:06:07.960 --> 3:06:14.680]  hyperbole all the you know the terror journalism about the delta variant well the truth is the
[3:06:14.680 --> 3:06:21.640]  delta variant is most likely being created or was created initially by those people who were
[3:06:21.640 --> 3:06:26.520]  vaccinated but that that's a different topic we're not going to get into that today nevertheless
[3:06:26.520 --> 3:06:34.200]  realize this again if you have natural immunity you have broad spectrum immunity you are immune
[3:06:34.840 --> 3:06:39.080]  to delta variants and other variants whatever they roll out and i think they're going to roll out
[3:06:39.080 --> 3:06:44.120]  what i'm calling the omega variant that's the one they're really going to scare us with so natural
[3:06:44.120 --> 3:06:50.440]  immunity works against future variants because natural immunity is a broad spectrum template
[3:06:50.440 --> 3:06:57.800]  of immunity in your body whereas vaccine immunity even when it works and it doesn't work
[3:06:58.360 --> 3:07:03.480]  very often because the vaccinated people the ones in the hospital but even when it does work
[3:07:04.120 --> 3:07:10.360]  it only works against a very specific polymorphism of the spike protein outer shell in other words
[3:07:10.360 --> 3:07:16.680]  only a very specific configuration of the proteins it does not confer immunity against
[3:07:16.680 --> 3:07:24.360]  these other variants such as the delta variant now what does this tell you it tells you that the
[3:07:24.360 --> 3:07:31.720]  pandemic is being perpetuated by the vaccine and i'm going to say that again the pandemic is being
[3:07:31.720 --> 3:07:39.320]  perpetuated by the vaccine the vaccine is creating the the immune system vulnerabilities
[3:07:39.320 --> 3:07:46.680]  and weaknesses that allow future variants to infect and hospitalize people and to create the
[3:07:46.680 --> 3:07:52.280]  media narrative that oh my god more people are dying therefore we have to have a booster vaccine
[3:07:52.280 --> 3:07:58.360]  right got to have a booster against the delta variant so then they're going to roll out booster
[3:07:58.360 --> 3:08:04.040]  shots to say well your vaccine passport that we once told you was going to give you freedom is
[3:08:04.040 --> 3:08:09.480]  now obsolete you're not going to have immunity anymore you're not going to be able to travel around
[3:08:09.480 --> 3:08:13.720]  anymore unless you get another vaccine for the delta variant because the delta variant you know
[3:08:13.720 --> 3:08:18.280]  gosh that's scary people are getting sick got to have a booster for that so if you're dumb enough to
[3:08:18.280 --> 3:08:24.600]  get that vaccine shot that's now your third shot that's a third dose of spike protein you know bio
[3:08:24.600 --> 3:08:30.680]  weapons in your body then before long they're going to roll out you know the lambda variant or the
[3:08:30.680 --> 3:08:34.280]  omega variant and you're not you're not going to have immunity to that and they're going to say well
[3:08:34.280 --> 3:08:40.440]  you need to have an omega booster and then there's omega 21 and omega 22 and omega 23 and so on
[3:08:40.440 --> 3:08:46.520]  if this is a never-ending scam that eventually kills you with spike protein injections but
[3:08:46.520 --> 3:08:54.280]  it's all perpetuated by the vaccine itself if no one were being vaccinated right now no one
[3:08:54.280 --> 3:09:02.120]  this pandemic would be over because people would have natural immunity now and I'm not saying that
[3:09:02.120 --> 3:09:07.160]  should have just ended all vaccines without also doing something else like promoting vitamin D
[3:09:07.160 --> 3:09:12.440]  promote promoting nutrition the things that work and of course treating people with ivermectin and
[3:09:12.440 --> 3:09:18.040]  hydroxychloroquine because those are proven to work to save lives especially in the elderly who
[3:09:18.040 --> 3:09:25.640]  have comorbidity factors but instead of saving lives they suppressed ivermectin and they push the
[3:09:25.640 --> 3:09:31.960]  vaccine to get as many people as possible vaccinated to spread the delta variant and other variants
[3:09:31.960 --> 3:09:37.000]  that are yet coming this is the perpetuation of the pandemic in other words the vaccine is the
[3:09:37.000 --> 3:09:45.160]  pandemic the vaccine is the pandemic now we're going to tie this into south africa next and
[3:09:45.160 --> 3:09:53.000]  we'll start with the fact that in south africa we now have the uprising going into an overreaction
[3:09:53.000 --> 3:10:00.280]  mode with irrational a lashing out where they are attacking and destroying the very infrastructure
[3:10:00.280 --> 3:10:06.840]  that could provide them with food electricity and fuel in the years ahead they are obliterating
[3:10:06.840 --> 3:10:13.240]  the infrastructure which means they're going to starve to death from here forward south africa
[3:10:13.240 --> 3:10:20.520]  will face mass starvation famine civil unrest possibly civil war maybe a failed state scenario
[3:10:20.520 --> 3:10:23.960]  because they burned the transportation trucks they burned the grocery stores they burned the
[3:10:23.960 --> 3:10:30.600]  power plants they burned the ports in some cases it's going to get bad now when we come back we're
[3:10:30.600 --> 3:10:35.800]  going to go to a break quickly here we come back i'll continue to explain how this all ties together
[3:10:35.800 --> 3:10:42.120]  with what's about to happen in america probably this year so stay tuned for that it's a horrifying

[3:13:14.040 --> 3:13:19.880]  it's mike adams you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:13:24.120 --> 3:13:29.320]  all right this is mike adams here continuing our breaking story of course i'm the editor of
[3:13:29.320 --> 3:13:33.880]  naturalnews.com and we are all part of the independent media that has been telling the
[3:13:33.880 --> 3:13:40.440]  truth this entire time just like info wars we from day one we said yes this came out of a lab
[3:13:40.440 --> 3:13:46.920]  and isn't it interesting that now so many left-wing news organizations are apologizing
[3:13:46.920 --> 3:13:53.560]  to their viewers and saying yep the lab theory is is the most likely origin of this well we're
[3:13:53.560 --> 3:13:58.520]  the apologies to all of us right who said this from day one but continuing with our story here
[3:13:59.320 --> 3:14:03.880]  in the last segment we talked about uh the number of americans who have been vaccinated
[3:14:03.880 --> 3:14:09.800]  according to the cdc that's 184 million americans with at least one dose we talked about the uh
[3:14:09.800 --> 3:14:14.680]  the warning from doctors who say that more than half of those people may die over the next few
[3:14:14.680 --> 3:14:21.400]  years so we'll call that 92 million which is which is half and then where this is going in terms of
[3:14:21.960 --> 3:14:28.040]  bringing in south africa and what's happening there and the globalist desire to create mass chaos
[3:14:28.040 --> 3:14:35.720]  across the planet so in south africa south africa we're going to go to news24.com and on news24.com
[3:14:35.720 --> 3:14:40.280]  which is a local website there they have many stories i'm not going to focus on any one but
[3:14:40.840 --> 3:14:48.680]  stories like sugar mills shut down cane farms set on fire citrus exports halted so we're
[3:14:48.680 --> 3:14:54.360]  seeing farms burned and we're seeing the key infrastructure of food production and food
[3:14:54.360 --> 3:15:02.200]  distribution either shut down or in some cases set on fire and destroyed unrest fallout may face
[3:15:02.200 --> 3:15:08.840]  bread shortages as riots hit wheat supplies we're also seeing transportation trucks on fire
[3:15:09.880 --> 3:15:13.960]  which means you know how they're going to transport food supplies how they're going to
[3:15:13.960 --> 3:15:19.400]  deliver groceries when the trucks are all burned up right another story there largest crude oil
[3:15:19.400 --> 3:15:26.040]  refinery implements a temporary shutdown due to unrest well that shutdown can become a permanent
[3:15:26.040 --> 3:15:32.600]  shutdown if the refinery is damaged or set on fire and there's an electrical power grid infrastructure
[3:15:32.600 --> 3:15:37.400]  facility there that's on fire and there are of course malls and grocery stores on fire that
[3:15:37.400 --> 3:15:42.760]  they've ransacked at least one of the major ports there for importing food so what's the
[3:15:42.760 --> 3:15:51.000]  realization in this when a local population is driven to such anger and destitution through the
[3:15:51.000 --> 3:16:00.840]  covid lockdowns the uprising goes to an irrational exaggerated posture where they end up burning
[3:16:00.840 --> 3:16:08.200]  down the very thing that could keep them fed or keep them clothed and we've seen this in left
[3:16:08.200 --> 3:16:13.880]  wing cities on a smaller scale in america especially during 2020 where they would burn down their own
[3:16:13.880 --> 3:16:19.160]  local retail stores right they would burn down their local communities well imagine this now
[3:16:19.160 --> 3:16:27.720]  now on a national scale involving every left wing city with all of the the hatred and bigotry
[3:16:27.720 --> 3:16:34.360]  and racism and fear that's been pushed by the mainstream media saying in the media saying
[3:16:34.360 --> 3:16:40.840]  white people are bad and white people deserve to be killed and police deserve they say to be to be
[3:16:40.840 --> 3:16:48.120]  harmed and when when you have a spark which is coming and in south africa the spark was the
[3:16:48.120 --> 3:16:53.080]  jailing of zuma after the the corruption court hearing where he failed to appear that was just
[3:16:53.080 --> 3:16:58.520]  a spark but that was not the underlying cause of all this all it takes is one spark in america
[3:16:59.080 --> 3:17:06.280]  and this race war erupts exactly as the globalist planned understand they have set the stage
[3:17:06.280 --> 3:17:11.400]  for a national uprising of mass looting that will destroy the infrastructure and this is part of
[3:17:11.400 --> 3:17:17.720]  their plan because they want the chaos now if you watched any of the videos or heard any of the
[3:17:17.720 --> 3:17:23.080]  audio from south africa there are some key realizations that i'm going to get into right
[3:17:23.080 --> 3:17:30.520]  here that not everybody is is fully talking about number one the the police have run out of ammo they
[3:17:30.520 --> 3:17:36.600]  ran out days ago and even the ammo they've been able to acquire is not the correct ammo i i heard
[3:17:36.600 --> 3:17:42.600]  one transmission where cops were talking about how they were able to acquire nine ball ammo well
[3:17:42.600 --> 3:17:49.080]  nine ball is just full metal jacket nine millimeter those are target rounds i mean practice target
[3:17:49.080 --> 3:17:55.960]  rounds you know that's not a self-defense round uh cops don't carry nine ball ammo uh if they if
[3:17:55.960 --> 3:18:03.320]  they know what they're doing they carry ammo where the bullet itself will of course uh spread out and
[3:18:03.320 --> 3:18:10.440]  and cause uh maximum trauma because the point of a police officer for example shooting someone is to
[3:18:10.440 --> 3:18:15.560]  stop them and you don't stop people by punching holes through them that have any nine millimeters
[3:18:15.560 --> 3:18:25.000]  in diameter you stop them with heavy trauma to to shatter let's say their pelvis or cause trauma to
[3:18:25.560 --> 3:18:30.600]  their abdominal region or their heart so that the blood stops pumping so that assailant can no
[3:18:30.600 --> 3:18:35.720]  longer attack that police officer or some innocent victim that they're targeting the point of of
[3:18:35.720 --> 3:18:41.080]  bullets is to stop the violence to stop the attacker but even in south africa they don't
[3:18:41.080 --> 3:18:47.000]  have that kind of ammo remaining uh much it seems anymore and there was one transmission where a
[3:18:47.000 --> 3:18:51.000]  police officer was saying oh he managed to get a thousand rounds of nine millimeter to distribute
[3:18:51.000 --> 3:18:57.720]  among uh the police and i think some civilian security forces a thousand rounds i'm thinking
[3:18:57.720 --> 3:19:02.840]  you know that's it they're down to the last box of a thousand rounds this is a very dangerous situation
[3:19:02.840 --> 3:19:08.520]  and it reinforces the idea that as society collapses you can almost never have too much
[3:19:08.520 --> 3:19:14.520]  ammo because you may need to provide ammunition to your local sheriff's department or a local
[3:19:14.520 --> 3:19:20.600]  civilian security force you may need ammo for more than just yourself and your family and what's
[3:19:20.600 --> 3:19:25.800]  happening the other realization is that it is civilians who are defending themselves against
[3:19:25.800 --> 3:19:32.040]  the the looting mobs civilians are doing the job that the police are incapable of doing because
[3:19:32.040 --> 3:19:36.840]  they've run out of ammo and they're not enough police officers and so on so if you ever wondered
[3:19:36.840 --> 3:19:43.480]  why you need a civilian force for national security a domestic security uh just look at south africa
[3:19:43.480 --> 3:19:52.040]  this is this is it right there the other realization is if you did not have stored food and you did
[3:19:52.040 --> 3:19:57.640]  not have a firearm and you did not have ammunition before all this started it very quickly becomes
[3:19:57.640 --> 3:20:05.800]  too late the time to prepare is now while you still can ammo prices have come down maybe 30
[3:20:05.800 --> 3:20:13.160]  percent from their highs under covid you can you can get some ammo now and and you should really
[3:20:13.160 --> 3:20:19.800]  consider that firearms are available in in many cases you can get firearms you can get pistols
[3:20:19.800 --> 3:20:25.560]  rifles and shotguns legally in america right now because the manufacturers are really producing
[3:20:25.560 --> 3:20:31.080]  firearms in record numbers and you know thank goodness they are because especially with left
[3:20:31.080 --> 3:20:37.720]  wing cities defunding the police even the police themselves the ones that don't just quit and go
[3:20:37.720 --> 3:20:41.400]  home and decide to protect their own families which is probably a rational thing to do in certain
[3:20:41.400 --> 3:20:47.000]  cities the ones that decide to stay on the force and try to protect your community they're going
[3:20:47.000 --> 3:20:54.440]  to need help it turns out they're going to need help so the vet veterans the off-duty cops people
[3:20:54.440 --> 3:21:01.320]  who a civilian firearms experts and those with emt training emergency response training volunteer
[3:21:01.320 --> 3:21:06.440]  fire departments and so on all of you are going to be necessary to protect your local communities
[3:21:06.440 --> 3:21:11.160]  because the mass looting you see in south africa is coming to america and when it happens they
[3:21:11.160 --> 3:21:17.160]  are going to spread out from the cities like a zombie apocalypse it's going to be like a zombie
[3:21:17.160 --> 3:21:22.520]  apocalypse these are people who are going to be brain damaged from the vaccines they will literally
[3:21:22.520 --> 3:21:27.880]  be brain damaged they're going to be desperate they're going to be starving hungry and violent
[3:21:27.880 --> 3:21:33.240]  their rationality will have been completely crushed they will think and act like zombies and
[3:21:33.240 --> 3:21:38.920]  it's going to be up to you and your neighbors and your local law enforcement rural sheriffs and
[3:21:38.920 --> 3:21:45.160]  deputies to defend your community or you will die that's the message you need to get we'll be
[3:21:45.160 --> 3:21:52.520]  back after this break with more analysis stay tuned you know listeners calling to the show and

[3:25:57.320 --> 3:26:18.840]  you found it the tip of the spear it is the alex jones show with mike adams
[3:26:18.840 --> 3:26:30.600]  all right continuing now with our analysis of the civil war and the chaos that's coming
[3:26:32.200 --> 3:26:35.960]  we have already covered the fact that 184 million americans have been
[3:26:35.960 --> 3:26:42.760]  vaccinated according to the cdc and we've covered the fact that in south africa the attacks on the
[3:26:42.760 --> 3:26:49.320]  infrastructure are destroying the ability of the the food infrastructure to provide food for the
[3:26:49.320 --> 3:26:55.800]  foreseeable future it could take years to rebuild what's happening in south africa now look carefully
[3:26:55.800 --> 3:27:03.480]  at the fact that south africa is now deploying the military they are deploying the military
[3:27:03.480 --> 3:27:10.040]  because the chaos is so great that there's no other way to control the situation and prevent
[3:27:10.040 --> 3:27:15.800]  the violence and prevent south africa from collapsing into a failed state status now
[3:27:15.800 --> 3:27:21.000]  track this very carefully they're deploying the military this is the template for what's
[3:27:21.000 --> 3:27:28.120]  coming to the united states the goal is in the us the goal is to deploy the military they want
[3:27:28.120 --> 3:27:33.320]  to deploy the military because they want to go door to door and confiscate guns they want to
[3:27:33.320 --> 3:27:41.000]  declare martial law they want to also go door to door with forced vaccines at gunpoint in order
[3:27:41.000 --> 3:27:47.400]  to maximize the injections of the bio weapon the spike protein bio weapon so they can kill
[3:27:47.400 --> 3:27:54.600]  as many americans as possible so in other words the chaos feeds into the justification of military
[3:27:54.600 --> 3:28:00.920]  deployment domestically which i know is against the law but again this regime doesn't follow any
[3:28:00.920 --> 3:28:08.760]  law whatsoever so they're going to do it anyway and then this will allow the illegitimate biden
[3:28:08.760 --> 3:28:17.320]  biden regime to then claim a military dictatorship over america and any who resist that military
[3:28:17.320 --> 3:28:23.160]  dictatorship will be labeled of course domestic terrorists and that will give them justification
[3:28:23.160 --> 3:28:29.800]  to execute you on site if you either refuse a turn in a firearm or refuse to be vaccinated you
[3:28:29.800 --> 3:28:34.680]  will be labeled a domestic terrorist in fact that kind of language is already being used publicly
[3:28:34.680 --> 3:28:40.600]  by left-wing you know fake news groups and so on they're blaming republicans for not taking the
[3:28:40.600 --> 3:28:46.520]  vaccine it's kind of like hitler blaming the jews for not going quickly enough to the gas chambers
[3:28:47.080 --> 3:28:53.560]  and the concentration camps you know if hitler said well the jews are you know camp hesitant
[3:28:53.560 --> 3:28:59.320]  and that would be equivalent to to what gen sake is saying today that republicans are vaccine
[3:28:59.320 --> 3:29:05.240]  hesitant well yeah of course republicans are hesitant at being killed with biological weapons
[3:29:05.240 --> 3:29:10.600]  injections but now here's where this is going and this is this is a big story i'm trying all the
[3:29:10.600 --> 3:29:18.520]  pieces together here if well let me bring in one more thing notice that the biden regime is pushing
[3:29:18.520 --> 3:29:24.760]  for vaccine requirements at workplaces this is one of the strategies is to say that if you work
[3:29:25.640 --> 3:29:32.760]  at some key infrastructure location if you work for the fire department if you work for the police
[3:29:32.760 --> 3:29:38.440]  department if you work at a local nuclear power plant you are going to be required to be vaccinated
[3:29:38.440 --> 3:29:44.120]  in order to keep your job what's the purpose of that what's the real purpose of that well they
[3:29:44.120 --> 3:29:48.920]  know the vaccines are death weapons they know their kill shots they know that very likely the
[3:29:48.920 --> 3:29:55.240]  majority of those who are vaccinated will be dead over the next several years requiring vaccines at
[3:29:55.240 --> 3:30:02.840]  workplaces means they're targeting critical infrastructure to lose personnel in other words
[3:30:03.400 --> 3:30:09.000]  the power grid needs people to keep it running obviously it you know you got to have a lot of
[3:30:09.000 --> 3:30:14.600]  people running the power plants you know the natural gas generators the coal power plants
[3:30:15.400 --> 3:30:21.000]  that you know the substations all of it lines men the whole deal without people the power grid
[3:30:21.000 --> 3:30:26.600]  doesn't function without people hospitals don't function without people first responders can't
[3:30:26.600 --> 3:30:32.360]  function and it is these infrastructure components that are being targeted for mandatory vaccinations
[3:30:32.360 --> 3:30:39.480]  in order to take those people out in order to lead to a total collapse of the infrastructure in America
[3:30:40.120 --> 3:30:44.680]  which will lead to exactly the kind of civil unrest that you're seeing in South Africa
[3:30:44.680 --> 3:30:50.520]  which leads to deploying the military and declaring martial law and a military dictatorship in
[3:30:50.520 --> 3:30:57.000]  America so you understand the vaccine I know this was multiple steps but you know if you're a viewer
[3:30:57.000 --> 3:31:03.560]  of this show you're good at this you're good at putting the pieces of the puzzle together the
[3:31:03.560 --> 3:31:09.480]  steps are clear vaccinate those people kill off those people that's what they want to do the people
[3:31:09.480 --> 3:31:14.360]  in the infrastructure and then collapse the infrastructure now then so I ask you this question
[3:31:15.160 --> 3:31:21.320]  this is the bottom show question if 92 million Americans are dead from vaccines and we don't
[3:31:21.320 --> 3:31:25.240]  know the timetable for this we don't know if the number is really 92 million let's say it's only 50
[3:31:25.240 --> 3:31:32.360]  million let's say it's half that or roughly half then how do the nuclear power plants
[3:31:33.800 --> 3:31:42.600]  go into a controlled uh offline status without having mistakes or criticality of their nuclear
[3:31:42.600 --> 3:31:48.040]  fuel you can't just flip a switch and turn off a nuclear power plant folks it doesn't work that
[3:31:48.040 --> 3:31:54.280]  way it has to be a controlled uh lifting of the rods you have to have the coolant circulated you
[3:31:54.280 --> 3:31:59.800]  have to have fuel you have to have emergency backup plans the whole deal there is a process and it
[3:31:59.800 --> 3:32:08.520]  takes many many weeks how do you how do you maintain civility in a city if the half the police are
[3:32:08.520 --> 3:32:17.000]  dead and the other half have been defunded or have fled how do you maintain food deliveries in a country
[3:32:17.000 --> 3:32:21.720]  where the workers in the grocery stores and the workers in the food distribution hubs
[3:32:21.720 --> 3:32:27.880]  and even the farms and farmers the crop pickers who are picking our strawberries and beans and
[3:32:27.880 --> 3:32:32.520]  crops and all of this if they if half of them are dead or even a quarter of them are dead
[3:32:33.400 --> 3:32:39.080]  how does that infrastructure function and it is these infrastructure components that are being
[3:32:39.080 --> 3:32:45.560]  targeted with the vaccines so the point is that those of you who have refused to take vaccines
[3:32:45.560 --> 3:32:52.840]  probably because you prefer to live you need to realize that they're going to collapse the
[3:32:52.840 --> 3:32:58.520]  infrastructure around you anyway they're going to take away your ability to go to the grocery
[3:32:58.520 --> 3:33:03.880]  store and purchase food your ability to have electricity delivered to your home or business
[3:33:04.440 --> 3:33:10.520]  your ability to call 911 and have emergency services respond in any manner not even a timely
[3:33:10.520 --> 3:33:16.200]  matter but to respond at all it'll be like thank you for calling 911 what's your emergency oh never
[3:33:16.200 --> 3:33:21.480]  mind there's nobody here leave a message that's what you're going to get if they even answer at all
[3:33:21.480 --> 3:33:29.880]  if the phone system even works at all and then as this when this reaches its peak of chaos the
[3:33:29.880 --> 3:33:37.560]  globalists are going to unleash a banking emergency a global debt bomb and we don't know the exact
[3:33:37.560 --> 3:33:44.440]  timing of course but they are prepared to unleash a global debt bomb and this will cause this this
[3:33:44.440 --> 3:33:50.760]  will be like throwing gasoline on a fire so in an instant and this will ripple across the
[3:33:50.760 --> 3:33:56.600]  banking system in no time at all people won't be able to use their food stamp cards and when food
[3:33:56.600 --> 3:34:03.800]  stamps go down every major urban area in america erupts into total chaos and lawlessness within a
[3:34:03.800 --> 3:34:11.160]  matter of hours it will look like south africa in every city in america okay when banking transactions
[3:34:11.160 --> 3:34:18.440]  can no longer function because the fiat currency has collapsed that means that no one can pay for
[3:34:18.440 --> 3:34:26.360]  transportation of fuel or food or ammunition or consumer goods or emergency medicine antibiotics
[3:34:26.360 --> 3:34:32.440]  whatever you can't even transport anything at that point the entire transactional system
[3:34:32.440 --> 3:34:39.000]  shuts down and by the way that means at that time you won't be able to buy anything from the info
[3:34:39.000 --> 3:34:45.320]  war store or any store because all credit card transactions will be toast at that time this is
[3:34:45.320 --> 3:34:50.760]  why it's critical to stock up before that happens and by the way yes they can flip a switch and make
[3:34:50.760 --> 3:34:55.560]  that happen at any moment that they choose and they're waiting for the right moment to do that
[3:34:55.560 --> 3:35:02.040]  once that happens they're going to use the chaos to try to usher in financial communism
[3:35:02.600 --> 3:35:08.120]  and sweep everybody into a federal reserve cryptocurrency wallet mark of the beast it's
[3:35:08.120 --> 3:35:14.680]  going to be a digital control system to control your life complete financial tyranny but everybody
[3:35:14.680 --> 3:35:21.640]  will be so desperate that most people will easily scream out for some kind of solution and they will
[3:35:21.640 --> 3:35:27.880]  leap to whatever solution the globalists are dangling in front of them and that will be a central
[3:35:27.880 --> 3:35:32.680]  bank digital wallet maybe they'll call it a crypto you know fed coin or something i don't
[3:35:32.680 --> 3:35:37.640]  know what they'll call it that's a mark of the beast system and if you don't participate then you
[3:35:37.640 --> 3:35:42.840]  will be ostracized from society and if you do participate you will be enslaved and there's
[3:35:42.840 --> 3:35:47.160]  more to this we'll cover that after this break on the other side say with us here info wars.com

[3:39:59.280 --> 3:40:20.120]  all right final segment of this hour when I'm gonna wrap up here now everything
[3:40:20.120 --> 3:40:23.840]  that we've talked about and give you the very big picture of where this is going
[3:40:23.840 --> 3:40:28.160]  I'm Mike Adams here editor of natural news comm thank you for continuing with
[3:40:28.160 --> 3:40:32.520]  me here on info wars comm today you know this every broadcast should be labeled
[3:40:32.520 --> 3:40:36.680]  an emergency broadcast given what's coming and the limited amount of time
[3:40:36.680 --> 3:40:43.160]  that we have remaining so in the last few segments what I laid out for you is
[3:40:43.160 --> 3:40:47.960]  the the engineered chaos that's coming to America and other countries this
[3:40:47.960 --> 3:40:52.320]  will happen in Canada Australia New Zealand and most European countries as
[3:40:52.320 --> 3:40:55.720]  well in other parts of Southeast Asia and of course Central and South America as
[3:40:55.720 --> 3:41:00.800]  well this is a global plan to exterminate humanity to take down the human
[3:41:00.800 --> 3:41:04.840]  race and crush human civilization I'm just explaining the mechanisms of how
[3:41:04.840 --> 3:41:09.400]  they're going to achieve that but here's what happens next so we talked about
[3:41:09.400 --> 3:41:14.680]  maybe 90 million 92 million Americans dying from the vaccine perhaps by the
[3:41:14.680 --> 3:41:21.280]  time you add in the deaths from disease and I'm talking about cholera you know
[3:41:21.280 --> 3:41:24.160]  because the cities will stop functioning you can have raw sewage flowing in the
[3:41:24.160 --> 3:41:27.440]  streets I mean more than more than what you would usually see in a left-wing
[3:41:27.440 --> 3:41:31.880]  city right now like San Francisco this the sewage systems will stop working
[3:41:31.880 --> 3:41:35.080]  water systems will stop working you know food deliveries and so on public
[3:41:35.080 --> 3:41:38.520]  sanitation will collapse you're gonna have disease you're gonna have rioting
[3:41:38.520 --> 3:41:42.600]  you're gonna have the financial collapse you're gonna have just a complete
[3:41:42.600 --> 3:41:46.920]  failure I mean anarchy is really the only way to describe this anarchy
[3:41:46.920 --> 3:41:52.720]  massive looting arson rape destruction pillaging ransacking everything
[3:41:52.720 --> 3:41:57.680]  especially the urban city areas I'm not saying this is gonna happen in in rural
[3:41:57.680 --> 3:42:02.000]  communities because I think rural communities will mount a defense against
[3:42:02.000 --> 3:42:06.400]  this using firearms using local law enforcement and volunteers and civilian
[3:42:06.400 --> 3:42:12.080]  security forces and so on but urban urban cities I mean you know left-wing
[3:42:12.080 --> 3:42:18.040]  cities are pretty much gone they will collapse the result of this is then of
[3:42:18.040 --> 3:42:21.640]  course at a national level the Biden regime which is an illegitimate regime
[3:42:21.640 --> 3:42:26.360]  that cheated to try to seize power by the way a lot of new evidence coming out
[3:42:26.360 --> 3:42:31.800]  of Georgia right now and also Arizona with the hearings today proving that
[3:42:31.800 --> 3:42:34.920]  there was election fraud it's provable fraud at this point I'm not going to go
[3:42:34.920 --> 3:42:40.440]  into it at this moment the Biden regime will assert military authority just like
[3:42:40.440 --> 3:42:43.840]  what's happening in South Africa they will declare essentially military
[3:42:43.840 --> 3:42:48.840]  dictatorship under the guise of public health from there we have two things that
[3:42:48.840 --> 3:42:53.360]  are going to happen this is according to my analysis and my sources number one
[3:42:53.360 --> 3:42:59.040]  you're going to have states and regions begin to declare a secession from the
[3:42:59.040 --> 3:43:04.280]  illegitimate Biden regime Texas will be part of this you're going to have the
[3:43:04.280 --> 3:43:09.560]  southern states Texas Louisiana Arkansas probably will seek Kansas and
[3:43:09.560 --> 3:43:13.520]  Oklahoma join that in Mississippi and so on you're gonna have southern states
[3:43:13.520 --> 3:43:22.040]  form a new union and you're going to have war against the illegitimate federal
[3:43:22.040 --> 3:43:28.480]  military I don't know what you call them at this point the the woke Pentagon I
[3:43:28.480 --> 3:43:32.920]  guess they're going to come after us with like transgender troops you know
[3:43:32.920 --> 3:43:36.920]  they're going to be wearing like rainbow dildo monkey butt suits and carrying
[3:43:36.920 --> 3:43:40.160]  M4s and marching towards Texas or something I'm not sure what that's
[3:43:40.160 --> 3:43:44.840]  going to look like but the Texas defenders are not going to be dressed
[3:43:44.840 --> 3:43:47.880]  like that they're going to be wearing you know military camo and actually
[3:43:47.880 --> 3:43:51.640]  fighting for freedom but you're going to see secession and you're going to see
[3:43:51.640 --> 3:43:56.160]  then war erupt across America as this is happening
[3:43:56.160 --> 3:44:02.360]  Biden and his handler Obama and I've predicted this for many years Obama will
[3:44:02.360 --> 3:44:08.240]  return to the United States as the head of the UN or a high-level influencer of
[3:44:08.240 --> 3:44:13.080]  the UN and we will see United Nations troops flooding into the United States
[3:44:13.080 --> 3:44:19.720]  probably communist Chinese troops under a UN banner that claim to be here to
[3:44:19.720 --> 3:44:26.880]  provide food operations humanitarian operations okay so the humanitarian
[3:44:26.880 --> 3:44:30.080]  operations in the same way that the Biden regime is going to be targeting
[3:44:30.080 --> 3:44:35.000]  Republican counties red states and red counties with you know vaccine quote
[3:44:35.000 --> 3:44:40.440]  outreach strike force teams you're going to have quote humanitarian missions
[3:44:40.440 --> 3:44:46.920]  run by communist Chinese troops under the command of the United Nations at the
[3:44:46.920 --> 3:44:53.680]  request of treasonous Biden that are then invading and attempting to occupy the
[3:44:53.680 --> 3:44:59.720]  United States importantly those invading forces will come in through both the
[3:44:59.720 --> 3:45:03.640]  southern border and also the northern border from Canada because of course
[3:45:03.640 --> 3:45:09.080]  Justin Trudeau not even going to go into that Justin Trudeau Justin Castro
[3:45:09.080 --> 3:45:12.280]  whatever you want to call him he is working with the communist Chinese
[3:45:12.280 --> 3:45:16.360]  he's practically a communist Chinese agent at this point so they're going to
[3:45:16.360 --> 3:45:21.040]  come from Canada but the bulk of the forces will come in along with armored
[3:45:21.040 --> 3:45:26.800]  up narco cartel strike force teams through the southern border which means
[3:45:26.800 --> 3:45:31.440]  Texas will be under attack Arizona California New Mexico these forces are
[3:45:31.440 --> 3:45:35.280]  going to come in and it's the narcos and the communist Chinese military they're
[3:45:35.280 --> 3:45:39.720]  already flying drone missions which are really surveillance missions in into in
[3:45:39.720 --> 3:45:44.240]  US territory such as that mysterious drone that was spotted over Tucson spying
[3:45:44.240 --> 3:45:49.360]  on key energy infrastructure and also the Davis month and Air Force base there
[3:45:49.360 --> 3:45:53.920]  in Tucson so you're going to have an invasion of the United States you're
[3:45:53.920 --> 3:45:57.680]  going to have a civil war you're going to have a crushed infrastructure and
[3:45:57.680 --> 3:46:03.760]  you're going to have mark of the beast economic efforts underway now we've got
[3:46:03.760 --> 3:46:06.640]  about four minutes left here how do you survive this I always try to give you
[3:46:06.640 --> 3:46:10.520]  solutions I know it sounds bad this is a nightmare scenario but how do you
[3:46:10.520 --> 3:46:17.120]  survive it key point number one you've got to have supplies to be able to live
[3:46:17.120 --> 3:46:22.360]  through a power grid failure food supply failures ammunition being cut off and
[3:46:22.360 --> 3:46:28.400]  also the internet being cut off so info wars and natural news and all the all
[3:46:28.400 --> 3:46:33.240]  the websites that you love will no longer function in many regions now there
[3:46:33.240 --> 3:46:38.240]  will be efforts by Washington to try to have an internet kill switch ultimately
[3:46:38.240 --> 3:46:42.600]  this is only going to achieve a segmentation a regional segmentation of
[3:46:42.600 --> 3:46:46.560]  censorship where if you're in California you won't be able to get to info wars
[3:46:46.560 --> 3:46:52.120]  calm but if you're in Texas you may still be able to get to it so and the
[3:46:52.120 --> 3:46:56.080]  same thing is true about e-commerce if you order from an online store like the
[3:46:56.080 --> 3:47:00.680]  info wars store which is based in Texas you may be able to still get some
[3:47:00.680 --> 3:47:04.720]  supplies and get delivery in the state of Texas or states that are part of the
[3:47:04.720 --> 3:47:09.240]  Texas Union but if you're outside that union if you're in California or New
[3:47:09.240 --> 3:47:14.200]  York you won't be able to even access the website nor to get deliveries of
[3:47:14.200 --> 3:47:18.920]  supplies so we're going to see economies in production become very localized and
[3:47:18.920 --> 3:47:24.400]  this is why the next solution to point out to you is you've got to move you
[3:47:24.400 --> 3:47:28.960]  got to vote with your feet now or never folks now or never you got to get to a
[3:47:28.960 --> 3:47:33.200]  red state you got to get there now a place that produces food that produces
[3:47:33.200 --> 3:47:37.760]  ammunition firearms and a place that's willing to say no to the federal
[3:47:37.760 --> 3:47:42.200]  tyranny that is coming the federal tyranny the the martial law military
[3:47:42.200 --> 3:47:46.320]  dictatorship that's coming so what states are these I mean you can you can
[3:47:46.320 --> 3:47:51.040]  figure it out you know it's it's Texas it's Florida it's it's North and South
[3:47:51.040 --> 3:47:57.560]  Dakota you know it's Wyoming and Utah maybe Arizona and so on most of the
[3:47:57.560 --> 3:48:02.560]  Midwest you know Indiana Missouri Kansas and so on and you know Kentucky and
[3:48:02.560 --> 3:48:05.960]  North Carolina just on and on but if you're in a blue state if you're stuck
[3:48:05.960 --> 3:48:11.560]  in a blue state you're probably going to well you're gonna be executed is what's
[3:48:11.560 --> 3:48:14.080]  gonna happen ultimately you're gonna be starved out you're gonna be injected
[3:48:14.080 --> 3:48:18.960]  with a bio weapon you're gonna have your guns confiscated you're gonna be you're
[3:48:18.960 --> 3:48:22.720]  gonna end up in a COVID concentration camp and end up dead that's what's
[3:48:22.720 --> 3:48:29.080]  coming so if you want to live you need to move to a red state that's the
[3:48:29.080 --> 3:48:34.400]  strongest that I can say that and it's no joke and time is running out if you
[3:48:34.400 --> 3:48:39.040]  prefer to die then you know just stay under Newsom's control in California
[3:48:39.040 --> 3:48:42.720]  they'll be glad to kill you door-to-door they're coming door-to-door with
[3:48:42.720 --> 3:48:46.400]  vaccines with the strike force squads they're gonna vaccinate you at gunpoint
[3:48:46.400 --> 3:48:51.920]  or kill you if you resist okay this this is a red alert moment this is the
[3:48:51.920 --> 3:49:01.760]  tipping point of history none of this is a joke we either live or or I mean we
[3:49:01.760 --> 3:49:06.440]  either stand up and resist this with the help of God and the help of our fellow
[3:49:06.440 --> 3:49:11.360]  countrymen and women or we die in perish and lose this nation and lose our
[3:49:11.360 --> 3:49:16.200]  world you understand now I think we're going to win but I think we're gonna
[3:49:16.200 --> 3:49:19.840]  lose tens of millions of Americans in the process okay so ultimately we
[3:49:19.840 --> 3:49:26.440]  achieve victory ultimately God wins ultimately we do we restart this nation
[3:49:26.440 --> 3:49:32.640]  but people that you know people that perhaps you love maybe family members
[3:49:32.640 --> 3:49:36.440]  are going to perish in this process some of them are already dead because they
[3:49:36.440 --> 3:49:42.280]  took the vaccine they're already dead it's just a matter of time so what you
[3:49:42.280 --> 3:49:48.240]  can do between now and then keep watching these broadcasts download them if
[3:49:48.240 --> 3:49:52.720]  you can record them save everything to your local computers so that you have
[3:49:52.720 --> 3:49:57.320]  reference materials and you have the documents you have the how-to manuals
[3:49:57.320 --> 3:50:02.480]  emergency medicine growing your own food reloading how do you live off the land
[3:50:02.480 --> 3:50:07.240]  how do you live without electricity get going now on all of those plans because
[3:50:07.240 --> 3:50:12.040]  that's what would keep you alive during these historic times of total collapse
[3:50:12.040 --> 3:50:17.840]  that's my story I'll probably write it up at some point in text format but thank
[3:50:17.840 --> 3:50:20.920]  you for watching today I'm Mike Adams the health ranger in naturalnews.com
[3:50:20.920 --> 3:50:26.240]  thank you for watching infowars.com here and I think over Shroyer is coming up
[3:50:26.240 --> 3:50:33.240]  next thanks for tuning in take care God bless
[3:50:40.520 --> 3:50:42.160]  I never had a marketing plan for
[3:50:42.160 --> 3:50:45.800]  infowars I went out and found the best products I could find from the research
[3:50:45.800 --> 3:50:49.600]  to funder operation I wanted you to get products that empowered you that you
[3:50:49.600 --> 3:50:53.200]  loved so you'd want to come back and buy more I treat you like I want to be
[3:50:53.200 --> 3:50:56.640]  treated it's very very simple it's instinctive it's spiritual it's what I
[3:50:56.640 --> 3:51:01.240]  do and that said our iodine products have become our best sellers and X2 right
[3:51:01.240 --> 3:51:06.440]  now is discounted because listeners and viewers are habituated to only buy it
[3:51:06.440 --> 3:51:10.760]  when it's on sale and so I'm gonna catch 22 when I don't have it on sale I don't
[3:51:10.760 --> 3:51:14.040]  sell it but we're selling out of all other products because of supply chain
[3:51:14.040 --> 3:51:17.880]  breakdowns and so I'm gonna catch 22 I need to sell products at full price but
[3:51:17.880 --> 3:51:22.520]  I can't I gotta sell them at discount and so it's discounted 40% off for the
[3:51:22.520 --> 3:51:26.240]  dropper bottle 60% off for the spray bottle even though it's about to sell
[3:51:26.240 --> 3:51:31.480]  out it won't be available for months so get it X2 is selling out at infowars
[3:51:31.480 --> 3:51:35.720]  store.com for 40 and 60% off with double Patriot points and free shipping
[3:51:35.720 --> 3:51:39.720]  because why that's when you buy it we need your funds or it'll be off air it's
[3:51:39.720 --> 3:51:42.120]  amazing product
[3:51:43.200 --> 3:51:47.760]  the globalists are having their revolution but for humanity has to have
[3:51:47.760 --> 3:51:53.480]  its revolution. We have to first recognize this anti-human takeovers
[3:51:53.480 --> 3:52:00.240]  trying to enslave the entire biological processes of humans and turn us into
[3:52:00.240 --> 3:52:09.240]  these artificial corporate controlled slaves. Orson slaves just just property
[3:52:09.240 --> 3:52:14.880]  from cradle to grave of the system rendered down to be servile minions of
[3:52:14.880 --> 3:52:20.080]  the system and a ritual of dominance and satanic control. We have to recognize
[3:52:20.080 --> 3:52:24.640]  the great reset post-industrial world which realizes a nightmare dystopia and
[3:52:24.640 --> 3:52:28.440]  we have to promote liberty and freedom that is the opposite of their dystopia
[3:52:28.440 --> 3:52:34.160]  it's that choice it's that realization that's gonna change the world and it's
[3:52:34.160 --> 3:52:38.600]  the only choice we've got freedom or slavery go to evil it is a spiritual
[3:52:38.600 --> 3:52:42.800]  battle and info wars at the tip of the spear fighting it
[3:52:42.800 --> 3:52:48.800]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
