[00:00.000 --> 00:25.520]  It's Tuesday, July 6th, the year is 2021, and I know that record numbers of new people
[00:25.520 --> 00:32.120]  who have never listened to the actual live unedited broadcast are tuning in to find out
[00:32.120 --> 00:38.080]  what all the commotion is about, thanks to enemies attacking us, thanks to folks defending
[00:38.080 --> 00:39.080]  us.
[00:39.080 --> 00:42.960]  We've trended number one several times last week on Twitter.
[00:42.960 --> 00:47.160]  We're constantly trending every day until they would take us out of the trending, which
[00:47.160 --> 00:52.000]  is a big deal because it shows that we're already one of the biggest topics in the world.
[00:52.000 --> 00:55.840]  This show, this broadcast, and what's happening.
[00:55.840 --> 01:05.520]  They attacked Tucker Carlson, of course, saying that Tucker Carlson is the new Alex Jones as
[01:05.520 --> 01:11.440]  if that will get the canceled culture organized to then go after Carlson and try to remove
[01:11.440 --> 01:12.800]  him off the air.
[01:12.800 --> 01:19.200]  All that's going to do is drive up Tucker's already top ratings, but it's so archetypal.
[01:19.200 --> 01:25.040]  It's such a great juxtaposition of the failed CNN, totally discredited, the failed MSNBC
[01:25.040 --> 01:29.800]  with Brian Williams, their fact checker, the guy that said he was shot down in a helicopter,
[01:29.800 --> 01:30.800]  lied about it.
[01:30.800 --> 01:35.120]  It'd be like having Hitler over a Nuremberg trial for punishing the Nazis.
[01:35.120 --> 01:41.360]  It's all so ridiculous that no one is buying into it, but there they are with no viewers,
[01:41.360 --> 01:46.640]  basically, trying to shut down everybody that has viewers because freedom is popular, even
[01:46.640 --> 01:53.240]  if they were successful in shutting us all down, even if they were successful in shutting
[01:53.240 --> 01:59.880]  us all down, people would still rebel against them and they would still be sacks of garbage.
[01:59.880 --> 02:07.080]  At the bottom of the hour, I'm going to play the Brian Stelter, Oliver Darcy, attack piece,
[02:07.080 --> 02:14.640]  and make some choice comments about both men and how the book definitely, inside, definitely
[02:14.640 --> 02:20.280]  matches the cover, and we're going to talk about some of their activities, and so that
[02:20.280 --> 02:26.680]  should be somewhat informative overall at the bottom of the hour, if not entertaining.
[02:26.680 --> 02:29.720]  But I'm going to tell you one more time, you're a radio listener.
[02:29.720 --> 02:36.920]  You can't see this, but I'm going to have the photo posted, after all, we subscribe to
[02:36.920 --> 02:40.640]  Getty Images, pay happy sum every month you're able to use these.
[02:40.640 --> 02:41.640]  That's a Getty Image.
[02:41.640 --> 02:43.040]  That's official glamour shot.
[02:43.040 --> 02:49.760]  He thinks that photo of himself is something that is worthy of note and that he thinks
[02:49.760 --> 02:51.520]  reflects well upon him.
[02:51.520 --> 02:56.120]  Talk about being psychotic or sociopathic and having no connection to reality and being
[02:56.120 --> 02:57.840]  tone deaf.
[02:57.840 --> 03:02.880]  That is an extremely psychotic, evil-looking person.
[03:02.880 --> 03:08.000]  I'm not saying Brian Stelter is a pedophile, I'm saying, if I was a Hollywood director
[03:08.000 --> 03:11.800]  casting someone that kidnapped children off the streets, takes them into a dungeon and
[03:11.800 --> 03:18.480]  eats them, or grabs them out of gutters and manhole covers at the clown, it would be this
[03:18.480 --> 03:19.480]  individual.
[03:19.480 --> 03:24.680]  In fact, putting the clown regalia on him only makes him look likeable.
[03:24.680 --> 03:25.680]  Take it off.
[03:25.680 --> 03:26.680]  Back it up.
[03:26.680 --> 03:30.800]  That's scary as hell.
[03:30.800 --> 03:36.480]  I mean, that's like a monster creature out of nightmares, but he is the mouth, the puppet
[03:36.480 --> 03:43.560]  of Jeff Zucker, who I will say looks almost as creepy, but not as creepy.
[03:43.560 --> 03:48.920]  I mean, Brian Stelter is going to be the creepiest man in the galaxy, and that's the best they
[03:48.920 --> 03:53.200]  can get is Brian Williams lying, being shot down in helicopters over in MSNBC as their
[03:53.200 --> 03:58.120]  fact checker, and you've got this little liar who says, quote, ratings don't matter to Ted
[03:58.120 --> 04:02.040]  Coppel, or Ted Coppel sitting back with all his gravitas, say what you want about him.
[04:02.040 --> 04:06.360]  The guy is very smart and very suave in that famous interview, and there's Carlson trying
[04:06.360 --> 04:10.600]  to act all suave, looking like a $3 bill.
[04:10.600 --> 04:13.720]  As phony as you can get, oh, ratings don't matter.
[04:13.720 --> 04:17.360]  These people gaslight us, but you know, it's not working.
[04:17.360 --> 04:20.720]  The only people it's working on is them.
[04:20.720 --> 04:24.760]  They still believe that they're in charge, they're controlling the culture, and all the
[04:24.760 --> 04:29.680]  poison they're spewing, all the anti-family garbage is just that, anti-family garbage.
[04:29.680 --> 04:32.040]  So I'll talk about it at the bottom of the hour, because it's illustrative of everything
[04:32.040 --> 04:33.040]  we face.
[04:33.040 --> 04:38.920]  Wow, Biden's not done, he's announced more pipelines to be shut down, more infrastructure
[04:38.920 --> 04:41.640]  to be shut down, and it's true, I thought it was hoax.
[04:41.640 --> 04:44.600]  It's in the Israeli papers, they're praising it.
[04:44.600 --> 04:48.640]  Biden got on his knees to the Israeli prime minister and bowed to him on his knees.
[04:48.640 --> 04:53.320]  We thought Obama was bad, bowing to the Saudis and the Japanese emperor.
[04:53.320 --> 04:57.720]  This is a new level of disgusting behavior, my God, next will be on his belly.
[04:57.720 --> 05:03.240]  When the first world collapses, the third world dies, and we're seeing tens of millions
[05:03.240 --> 05:08.000]  of extra people in the third world now, starved to death, thanks to Klaus Schwab and Bill
[05:08.000 --> 05:11.280]  Gates, the great reset, they need to go to prison for what they've done.
[05:11.280 --> 05:14.800]  And here in the U.S., we've seen more than half the small businesses go out of business,
[05:14.800 --> 05:19.360]  and every major supplement supplier we've got is either closing or operating at minimum
[05:19.360 --> 05:25.040]  capacity because they can't even get product in for the raw material.
[05:25.040 --> 05:29.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, that's why it's more important than ever to realize that the products
[05:29.240 --> 05:33.600]  we do have available at InfoWareStore.com are the product sales that are keeping us
[05:33.600 --> 05:38.400]  on air, and I know you're always used to big sales, and so you don't buy the products
[05:38.400 --> 05:40.560]  until they're on sale, so it's a catch-22.
[05:40.560 --> 05:44.120]  We have less of the product, and we're still selling it at a huge discount.
[05:44.120 --> 05:47.480]  I don't know how long I can keep doing this, but for now, it's a catch-22.
[05:47.480 --> 05:52.640]  I've got to have the money come in, so please get X2, please get X3 at 50% and 60% off with
[05:52.640 --> 05:55.680]  free shipping, double-paid reappoints, and a bunch of other sales right now that are
[05:55.680 --> 06:13.240]  about to end because we've got to sell those products to stay on air.
[06:13.240 --> 06:24.520]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[06:24.520 --> 06:31.080]  There is a mystery that I will address coming up here in just a few minutes.
[06:31.080 --> 06:36.120]  Whether it's Japan, whether it's India, whether it's Nigeria, whether it is the United States
[06:36.120 --> 06:42.760]  of America or Canada or Mexico everywhere, they're finding that major pharmacies and
[06:42.760 --> 06:49.800]  major government institutions that are pushing the so-called COVID-19 vaccines are actually
[06:49.800 --> 06:53.240]  giving people a saline solution.
[06:53.240 --> 06:58.400]  This has been a big story since it started, six months ago in the U.K., eight months ago,
[06:58.400 --> 07:02.200]  I guess in the U.K., six months here in the U.S., the inoculations began, the so-called
[07:02.200 --> 07:06.080]  inoculations, the genetic engineering.
[07:06.080 --> 07:13.120]  But now I've got the answer to this because I've talked to enough of the medical workers,
[07:13.120 --> 07:17.760]  so I'm going to be breaking that down for you coming up.
[07:17.760 --> 07:23.640]  Next segment, report U.S. Army Direct's commands to prep for mandatory COVID shots for troops.
[07:23.640 --> 07:24.640]  That ties in with that.
[07:24.640 --> 07:29.880]  We have just massive globalist takeover COVID-19 news because that's why this is bigger than
[07:29.880 --> 07:31.040]  just the inoculations.
[07:31.040 --> 07:33.880]  It's bigger than just the World ID and medical passports.
[07:33.880 --> 07:35.960]  It is their total complete push.
[07:35.960 --> 07:36.960]  It is everything.
[07:36.960 --> 07:45.080]  If you want to understand what we're up against as a society and as a culture.
[07:45.080 --> 07:52.240]  But before I do that, let me just tell you some of the news that is coming up today.
[07:52.240 --> 07:57.000]  I have so many videos every day of black people viciously attacking white people that I couldn't
[07:57.000 --> 07:59.480]  air them if I had 20 hours.
[07:59.480 --> 08:04.280]  Plus, I'm not here trying to demonize black people.
[08:04.280 --> 08:09.160]  The majority of black folks are doing that, but there is a vehement, aggressive minority
[08:09.160 --> 08:13.840]  of racist black folks that are shooting and stabbing and killing whites and Asians in
[08:13.840 --> 08:14.840]  some Hispanics.
[08:14.840 --> 08:17.080]  And when they get arrested, they say, well, they deserve it.
[08:17.080 --> 08:18.760]  They're evil and they're racist and they're bad.
[08:18.760 --> 08:23.680]  And this is all directly due to mainstream media and the corporate news.
[08:23.680 --> 08:31.440]  The same ones that are hiding all of these good treatments that are 99% effective, like
[08:31.440 --> 08:38.360]  hydroxychloroquine, rendezvous here, and others.
[08:38.360 --> 08:46.200]  And so again, it just shows how whatever the default evil, destructive, ruling class position
[08:46.200 --> 08:49.560]  of oppressing the people, they're doing it.
[08:49.560 --> 08:54.000]  And that ties into taxpayers could be on the hook for billions in damages to Canadian
[08:54.000 --> 09:02.120]  firm over Biden's cancellation of Keystone cost more than $15 billion to build it.
[09:02.120 --> 09:06.480]  And now there's another 60-something-year-old pipeline agreement with a whole bunch of old
[09:06.480 --> 09:10.600]  and new pipelines with the safest safety record the world's ever seen, by the way.
[09:10.600 --> 09:15.680]  I was reading deep into it a few weeks ago, upcoming out of Canada into Michigan with
[09:15.680 --> 09:21.200]  natural gas, gasoline, and oil pipelines that supply most of the Midwest.
[09:21.200 --> 09:26.640]  And the governor, quote, ordered them shut because Biden wants to heat off him.
[09:26.640 --> 09:31.600]  He said governors are allowed to now shut down pipelines, even that border Mexico and
[09:31.600 --> 09:35.880]  Canada, which under international law, governor can't do that.
[09:35.880 --> 09:41.440]  So this is just beyond criminal, just like the open border and saying, immediately surge
[09:41.440 --> 09:43.440]  the border.
[09:43.440 --> 09:48.160]  It's all part of the attack on our stability and our families and our society.
[09:48.160 --> 09:52.320]  And that's why the police have now set out in L.A. the woman calling the police on a
[09:52.320 --> 09:55.360]  man showing his penis to her six-year-old daughter.
[09:55.360 --> 09:57.080]  They've checked the surveillance footage.
[09:57.080 --> 09:58.080]  It's not denied.
[09:58.080 --> 10:01.000]  He went to women's bathroom and pulled his pants down and said, I've had sex with lots
[10:01.000 --> 10:02.000]  of women.
[10:02.000 --> 10:03.000]  Do you like my penis?
[10:03.000 --> 10:04.240]  I mean, this is what happened to the six-year-old folks.
[10:04.240 --> 10:06.520]  Sorry to talk about it on air.
[10:06.520 --> 10:11.440]  The police said it's bad, just like Cuomo said four years ago, if your daughter doesn't
[10:11.440 --> 10:16.400]  like seeing a woman's penis, women have penises now, according to the left, and you know,
[10:16.400 --> 10:19.240]  if your penis up is down, down is up, then you're a horrible person.
[10:19.240 --> 10:22.000]  And if your parents taught you that that's bad, you're a horrible person.
[10:22.000 --> 10:25.840]  Because if you'll put up with men in the shower with your six-year-old daughter, brother,
[10:25.840 --> 10:26.920]  you'll put up with anything.
[10:26.920 --> 10:31.040]  And then Antifa came out and beat up a bunch of people.
[10:31.040 --> 10:35.240]  There's hours of footage of them beating up women and men, by the way, most of us were
[10:35.240 --> 10:39.600]  like reasonable hippies just out there saying, hey, stop it.
[10:39.600 --> 10:45.280]  And they start beating them up because so you've got Antifa beating people up because
[10:45.280 --> 10:50.360]  they dare not want a full-grown man exposing himself to a little girl in the shower.
[10:50.360 --> 10:53.320]  And the police have now said on the news that it's a good thing to show your general's
[10:53.320 --> 10:54.320]  little girls.
[10:54.320 --> 10:57.320]  So that's, they passed a law two years ago in California.
[10:57.320 --> 11:03.520]  You can give someone HIV or hepatitis knowingly trying to kill them, and it's not a crime.
[11:03.520 --> 11:06.720]  So it's just total madness, total psychotic behavior.
[11:06.720 --> 11:12.000]  But let's go to an incredibly important report that John Bowne just posted to band.video
[11:12.000 --> 11:15.600]  last night in the John Bowne section, click the left-hand corner, you'll see all the menus
[11:15.600 --> 11:19.160]  there for the great pages, like Greg Rees and so many others, and click on the John
[11:19.160 --> 11:20.160]  Bowne one.
[11:20.160 --> 11:23.160]  SJW, your Marxist Revolution is over.
[11:23.160 --> 11:27.000]  Listen very carefully to this report because it's right out of the Communist Manifesto,
[11:27.000 --> 11:33.200]  right out of Das Kapital, where they say the elite wage war on you, the ultra-rich, crush
[11:33.200 --> 11:37.240]  the middle class, will under a corrupt globalist system they do, under a corrupt mercantile
[11:37.240 --> 11:39.480]  system they do, not under the American system.
[11:39.480 --> 11:43.840]  So you see, when they do all these horrible things, they're following a blueprint because
[11:43.840 --> 11:45.400]  they are the ruling class.
[11:45.400 --> 11:49.960]  Of course they live in $10 million houses and we're $5,000 outfits, they're AOC.
[11:49.960 --> 11:52.400]  You go bankrupt, you starve to death.
[11:52.400 --> 11:55.480]  Here is John Bowne's incredibly important report.
[11:55.480 --> 12:01.600]  Karl Marx's Conflict Theory proclaims that society is in a state of perpetual conflict
[12:01.600 --> 12:08.320]  due to the competition for limited resources, and that glue holding that social order together
[12:08.320 --> 12:13.600]  is domination in power rather than relegated by consensus and conformity.
[12:13.600 --> 12:19.040]  Those with wealth and power hold onto that power by suppressing the poor and the powerless.
[12:19.040 --> 12:25.720]  This theory fuels the Marxist Revolution that has exploded itself upon every facet of our
[12:25.720 --> 12:31.920]  lives, given a free pass on violating the social norms of race, gender, crime, and just
[12:31.920 --> 12:38.680]  about anything, the movement deems necessary to alter in order to dominate the average
[12:38.680 --> 12:39.680]  American's life.
[12:39.680 --> 12:44.040]  I also want to make sure that this hysteria, you know, that this doesn't drive a hysteria
[12:44.040 --> 12:49.360]  and that we look at these numbers in context so that we can make responsible decisions
[12:49.360 --> 12:53.240]  about what to allocate in that context.
[12:53.240 --> 12:56.440]  You know, furthermore, for her to say that it's just hysteria, as if it's all on her
[12:56.440 --> 12:59.240]  heads, it makes her as cold and callous about people losing their lives.
[12:59.240 --> 13:02.760]  I mean, it's as formal as when he downplayed the COVID-19 nursing home desk.
[13:02.760 --> 13:08.360]  A new conspiracy theory, a new Trump-inspired, Trump-incited kind of rage, white rage, she
[13:08.360 --> 13:10.080]  used the words of General Milley yesterday.
[13:10.080 --> 13:13.400]  Okay, Bill Maher has been whacked for a long time.
[13:13.400 --> 13:19.120]  I did see the clip segment of him complaining about Lin-Manuel Miranda apologizing for the
[13:19.120 --> 13:23.120]  lack of Afro-Latino representation in his movie, In the Heights.
[13:23.120 --> 13:27.360]  You're the guy who made the founding fathers black and Hispanic.
[13:27.360 --> 13:34.120]  I don't think you have to apologize to Twitter when he's a Latino making a Latino movie with
[13:34.120 --> 13:37.680]  a Latino cast, not good enough.
[13:37.680 --> 13:39.760]  Nothing is ever good enough for these people.
[13:39.760 --> 13:40.760]  They're like children.
[13:40.760 --> 13:45.360]  Okay, so I don't know if the applause from the audience was sincere or if they were responding
[13:45.360 --> 13:49.400]  to the applause sign in the studio, but either way, how disappointing.
[13:49.400 --> 13:53.600]  So perhaps it's time for you to take a step back and blow a quarter ounce of that green
[13:53.600 --> 13:58.240]  that you love so much because clearly your thoughts have been lost in a white fog for
[13:58.240 --> 13:59.240]  far too long.
[13:59.240 --> 14:04.040]  Why would they attempt to dominate the once independent lives of the middle class they
[14:04.040 --> 14:06.160]  claim they are protecting?
[14:06.160 --> 14:08.280]  Because the theory is flawed.
[14:08.280 --> 14:13.680]  Those with wealth and power still continue to dominate the poor and the powerless.
[14:13.680 --> 14:20.840]  They're just using hordes of mindless social justice warriors to gain access to that control.
[14:20.840 --> 14:27.840]  The left wing billionaire transferring 18 billion dollars to his open society foundation
[14:27.840 --> 14:34.080]  that makes it the second largest foundation in the country and it's all about politics.
[14:34.080 --> 14:37.920]  New at 10 a nearly overlooked consideration in the Milwaukee public school budget now
[14:37.920 --> 14:39.480]  stirring up controversy.
[14:39.480 --> 14:43.440]  The district is proposing nearly half a million dollars go to a program called Black Lives
[14:43.440 --> 14:44.440]  Matter.
[14:44.440 --> 14:48.040]  I'm here to support the Black Lives Matter funding proposed in the MPS budget.
[14:48.040 --> 14:52.320]  That's the main reason most of these people showed up tonight, to speak up or hold up
[14:52.320 --> 14:58.720]  a sign letting board members know they want them to spend around 470,000 dollars on Black
[14:58.720 --> 14:59.880]  Lives Matter.
[14:59.880 --> 15:03.920]  Marxists steal money from other people and they enrich themselves until the people that
[15:03.920 --> 15:07.560]  they stole from are poor and so she has stolen money from other people on the pretext of
[15:07.560 --> 15:11.760]  a lie that is Black Lives Matter and she's enriched herself and she's brought four homes.
[15:11.760 --> 15:15.560]  I mean you have to kind of appreciate the honesty, she's not hiding by any means you
[15:15.560 --> 15:18.000]  know and so yeah I tend to agree with you here.
[15:18.000 --> 15:21.440]  She's a communist through and through and she's been unbelievably unapologetic in her
[15:21.440 --> 15:22.600]  approach.
[15:22.600 --> 15:28.840]  Useful idiots doing the bidding of their masters against a free people dominated by our own
[15:28.840 --> 15:29.840]  media.
[15:29.840 --> 15:34.880]  There's no excuse for being a reporter today who doesn't understand the basic science of
[15:34.880 --> 15:35.880]  COVID-19.
[15:35.880 --> 15:39.520]  Why is it not the same for climate change?
[15:39.520 --> 15:44.240]  Right now everyone should be a climate reporter and if you're not a climate reporter right
[15:44.240 --> 15:45.720]  now you will be.
[15:45.720 --> 15:48.760]  But we are gradually learning the final lesson.
[15:48.760 --> 15:51.440]  The real revolution is obvious.
[15:51.440 --> 16:00.440]  Populism will inevitably rise against the foul stench of hypocrisy in one form or another.
[16:00.440 --> 16:02.440]  Your voice counts.
[16:02.440 --> 16:07.440]  When you share information be it over the internet or in person it changes the world.
[16:07.440 --> 16:10.040]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[16:10.040 --> 16:14.400]  They know you're angry and now to get around big tech it's more important than ever that
[16:14.400 --> 16:16.920]  we use every tool we've got.

[17:00.280 --> 17:04.880]  The globalists are having their revolution but free humanity has to have its revolution.
[17:04.880 --> 17:13.640]  We have to first recognize this anti-human takeovers trying to enslave the entire biological
[17:13.640 --> 17:23.240]  processes of humans and turn us into these artificial corporate controlled slaves, worst
[17:23.240 --> 17:30.480]  of slaves just property from cradle to grave of the system rendered down to be servile
[17:30.480 --> 17:35.360]  minions of the system and a ritual of dominance and safety and control.
[17:35.360 --> 17:40.040]  We have to recognize their great reset post industrial world which realizes a nightmare
[17:40.040 --> 17:45.400]  dystopia and we have to promote liberty and freedom that is the opposite of their dystopia.
[17:45.400 --> 17:50.480]  It's that choice, it's that realization that's going to change the world and it's the only
[17:50.480 --> 17:55.800]  choice we've got freedom or slavery go to reval it is a spiritual battle and info wars
[17:55.800 --> 18:00.800]  at the tip of the spear fighting it.
[18:00.800 --> 18:03.120]  There's a lot of things that we can't do to stop the globalist but there's a lot of
[18:03.120 --> 18:07.120]  things we can do and one of them is taking care of our bodies and our health and listen
[18:07.120 --> 18:10.800]  I'm lecturing myself at the same time I put myself through too much stress I don't eat
[18:10.800 --> 18:15.680]  right but one thing I do remember to do is to take my deep earth crystal high quality
[18:15.680 --> 18:22.560]  iodine and that of course is the original X2 incredible it is essential in your body
[18:22.560 --> 18:26.000]  it is a building block of everything that goes on the globalists work around the clock
[18:26.000 --> 18:30.640]  to make sure we are deficient in iodine and have way too much of all the garbage halogens
[18:30.640 --> 18:32.880]  like chlorine fluoride bromine and others.
[18:32.880 --> 18:37.480]  We also have X3 and that's because the research scientists pointed out to me and I saw the
[18:37.480 --> 18:42.600]  research it was true that some people can't absorb pure atomic iodine so it's pure atomic
[18:42.600 --> 18:46.760]  iodine and the two other types that are also good for your body that some people get better
[18:46.760 --> 18:50.480]  benefits from so it's apples and oranges both products are free shipping double patriot
[18:50.480 --> 18:57.200]  points 50% off for survival filled X2 and 60% off for X3 even though it's selling out right
[18:57.200 --> 19:01.320]  now.
[19:01.320 --> 19:26.280]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[19:26.280 --> 19:32.520]  Bill Gates is on record Warren Buffett is on record we got some new clips from these
[19:32.520 --> 19:38.760]  guys today that are really frightening as they and their cohorts praise the Communist
[19:38.760 --> 19:44.520]  Party of China that's coming up last segment of the show that I'm open the phones up to
[19:44.520 --> 19:49.520]  the balance of the transmission welcome back to the Alex Jones show but here's our COVID-19
[19:49.520 --> 19:56.840]  stack of news just from today thousands thought they were getting the COVID vaccine they were
[19:56.840 --> 20:02.840]  injected with saltwater instead now why does this happen what's going on well I figured
[20:02.840 --> 20:07.480]  out what's happening why are so many people being accidentally injected with saline instead
[20:07.480 --> 20:14.400]  of COVID vaccines we asked last week but here's the latest articles out today July 5th July
[20:14.400 --> 20:19.680]  6th CNN thousands thought they were getting COVID vaccine this was in India New Delhi
[20:19.680 --> 20:25.920]  well I've talked to a lot of nurses and a lot of doctors and a lot of other people and
[20:25.920 --> 20:29.840]  that work in the medical field and they said listen we know this stuff so deadly we know
[20:29.840 --> 20:35.840]  it's experimental we know it was never authorized and there was no real testing and we see what's
[20:35.840 --> 20:42.320]  happening we have so many patients and so many people that are getting sick and dying
[20:42.320 --> 20:47.080]  but when the people come asking for it we'll lose our job if we don't give it so we're
[20:47.080 --> 20:53.560]  giving them saline and they can't prosecute everybody and what do you have that's not
[20:53.560 --> 20:58.800]  tracked in a pharmacy it's the saline bottles they're a few dollars a bottle they've got
[20:58.800 --> 21:03.640]  hundreds and hundreds of bottles of them get any one time at a facility the bottles look
[21:03.640 --> 21:09.400]  very similar and they go here you want your COVID shot sweetheart I'm told particularly
[21:09.400 --> 21:14.320]  with children and you've seen a bunch of pharmacists lose their jobs when the woman comes in want
[21:14.320 --> 21:18.880]  their 12 year old and the lady goes hey you know they put an insert on there saying cause
[21:18.880 --> 21:23.920]  a heart attack I really think you should think about this how dare you get me the manager
[21:23.920 --> 21:29.640]  because they're a leftist and the leftist sacrament is getting conned getting ripped off getting
[21:29.640 --> 21:34.120]  hurt because they're already so Stockholm syndrome into two or three fake degrees that
[21:34.120 --> 21:39.880]  don't work not having a man in the home whatever the case is that they are just going deeper
[21:39.880 --> 21:48.160]  into the psychosis deeper into the delusion so on military bases they're already giving
[21:48.160 --> 21:53.520]  the officers saline and the word spread the rest of troops they've been refusing and the
[21:53.520 --> 21:59.480]  officers have been agreeing and just saying okay saline and anybody listening to military
[21:59.480 --> 22:07.560]  knows this has been going on for a long time especially with the anthrac shots in 1990 1991
[22:07.560 --> 22:12.280]  and 2000 they were so deadly until Congress finally acted and they outlawed giving it
[22:12.280 --> 22:19.360]  to people because you can't attenuate anthrax you can't kill it basically unless you burn
[22:19.360 --> 22:25.320]  it up in a furnace at a thousand degrees it'll survive 400 degrees it's a plant spore that
[22:25.320 --> 22:31.560]  grows in your lungs and so you can chop it up in pieces it's like a starfish and that's
[22:31.560 --> 22:36.040]  why they think that the life may have come here you know from another planet the scientists
[22:36.040 --> 22:41.240]  hypothesize I'm not saying I agree with that from anthrax but they believe it can live
[22:41.240 --> 22:45.440]  millions of years in the dirt they found samples they know are hundreds of thousands of years
[22:45.440 --> 22:52.560]  old so they injected that in people in experimental operations so that's why the military wouldn't
[22:52.560 --> 22:57.320]  do it this time because it wasn't authorized the anthrax wasn't authorized by the FDA so
[22:57.320 --> 23:05.600]  what did the military announce in their announcement of starting forced inoculations of the military
[23:05.600 --> 23:12.120]  as early as a month from now they said as soon as FDA approval is done see it never
[23:12.120 --> 23:18.120]  got FDA approval but I've seen on Facebook and Instagram and Twitter and on the street
[23:18.120 --> 23:23.680]  I had a woman when I was in New York will just walk by me and say the vaccine is approved
[23:23.680 --> 23:32.200]  it is safe and then she just kind of ran off they believe that they believe I'm lying when
[23:32.200 --> 23:39.320]  I say that it was never approved and got emergency authorization if there's no drug that is a
[23:39.320 --> 23:46.680]  viable treatment for any deadly pathogen under federal and international law they can waive
[23:46.680 --> 23:52.440]  the normal testing process see if there is no drug that's why they said ivermectin and
[23:52.440 --> 23:59.160]  hydroxychloroquine and rindesivir and all the rest of it couldn't be used was because
[23:59.160 --> 24:04.760]  it was all basically 100% treatable hundreds of different brands of aerosolized inhalable
[24:04.760 --> 24:11.000]  steroids you get it early 100% because it knocks out the autoimmune response it's killing
[24:11.000 --> 24:15.600]  you now as top scientists warn people that have been inoculated are the ones dying at
[24:15.600 --> 24:18.720]  record numbers because their body when it comes in contact with the coronavirus has
[24:18.720 --> 24:25.480]  an autoimmune response and attacks your own body liquefies your lungs this is that they
[24:25.480 --> 24:32.280]  knew they tested it all before you just said it wasn't tested this particular virus this
[24:32.280 --> 24:36.920]  particular vaccine but they tested similar vaccines on animals and we've shown you those
[24:36.920 --> 24:42.440]  studies we've gone over them University of Texas 2012 under Fauci did three different
[24:42.440 --> 24:48.600]  vaccine tests that would attack not the RNA of the virus inside but it's it's spike protein
[24:48.600 --> 24:54.000]  casing and now that's why you see so many illnesses and problems of the inoculated with
[24:54.000 --> 25:04.600]  this because it makes the body attack the the casing the casing not the RNA so thousands
[25:04.600 --> 25:08.280]  thought they were getting the COVID vaccine they were injected with saltwater and that's
[25:08.280 --> 25:13.840]  because the medical workers have a soul and instead of losing their jobs they're just
[25:13.840 --> 25:17.720]  doing what the military does and they are injecting people but then the managers come
[25:17.720 --> 25:23.120]  and go wait a minute we're missing hundreds and hundreds of bottles of saline but with
[25:23.120 --> 25:29.760]  all the vaccines here what's going on and then they say oh come back you didn't get
[25:29.760 --> 25:34.760]  your shot that's one of the main reasons this is going on because again higher ups aren't
[25:34.760 --> 25:40.680]  taking the real thing the lower downs figure that out go hell I'm not doing remember what
[25:40.680 --> 25:46.440]  happened a few months ago they testified in Congress half the CDC and NIH had not taken
[25:46.440 --> 25:51.560]  the vaccine more than half the medical workers in the US and in actual news won't take it
[25:51.560 --> 25:57.560]  because they know the doctor won't take it the nurse won't take it but you need to so
[25:57.560 --> 26:02.040]  there's your answer on that front I got a bunch of other news I'm gonna hit next hour
[26:02.040 --> 26:07.360]  U.S. Army directs commands to prep for mandatory COVID shots for troops the U.S. Army is prepping
[26:07.360 --> 26:11.120]  to enforce mandatory coronavirus vaccinations for service members from the beginning of
[26:11.120 --> 26:17.440]  September according to an Army Times report the report published Saturday notes the Army
[26:17.440 --> 26:22.160]  has directed command to prepare to administer mandatory COVID-19 vaccines as early September

[26:40.160 --> 26:47.360]  it's been tested it's safe no it's not and they did it open air so they could then not
[26:47.360 --> 26:54.920]  have an official count of the real dead which are pouring in now 10 year olds 13 year olds
[26:54.920 --> 27:00.440]  18 year olds 16 year olds football players cricket players dying getting sick rock and

[27:18.720 --> 27:25.200]  on all of it is at info wars dot com big text meeting an emergency session we got that article
[27:25.200 --> 27:29.560]  to try to learn how to suppress us better come up with new tools to shut you up so you
[27:29.560 --> 27:34.280]  can't warn people so they can block real treatments give you deadly shots and kill you they're
[27:34.280 --> 27:39.440]  eugenicists they're greedy globalist who believe they can only have super yachts and consume
[27:39.440 --> 27:44.800]  if they pay back to the world by killing useful cedars I say they're useful cedars I say they're
[27:44.800 --> 27:48.840]  the ones need to get out of the way I say they're the ones that need to die not us
[27:48.840 --> 28:01.280]  they'll be right back stay with us on Donald Jones info wars dot com
[28:01.280 --> 28:04.680]  granny do right granny do right thanks for holding her on the air go ahead
[28:04.680 --> 28:10.280]  challenge first of all let me say I love your product I am a granny and for all the
[28:10.280 --> 28:14.880]  senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me I was loaded
[28:14.880 --> 28:20.720]  up with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called but since taking your x2 for the last
[28:20.720 --> 28:28.120]  couple of years my skin is just really gorgeous actually people think I'm 55 years old and
[28:28.120 --> 28:32.200]  I was already taking your other supplements but I thought you know well maybe that's what
[28:32.200 --> 28:36.680]  I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation but when I started taking
[28:36.680 --> 28:42.160]  it and it doesn't happen immediately but you know over a period of time I started noticing
[28:42.160 --> 28:47.880]  okay you know this is a ticket this is working this is wonderful you know I don't I don't
[28:47.880 --> 28:53.400]  have to put on derma blend anymore you know so anyway it worked wonderfully and it really

[30:06.640 --> 30:14.360]  medium-sized businesses and it is leaking havoc in the supply chain thousands thousands
[30:14.360 --> 30:19.920]  of small companies have completely shut down and others are struggling to stay open because
[30:19.920 --> 30:25.360]  they can't get raw materials whether it's food whether it's medicine whether it's supplements
[30:25.360 --> 30:30.840]  whether it's for textiles whatever the product is you see it in the news it is record level
[30:30.840 --> 30:34.840]  supply chain breakdowns because the global is shut down the world economy for more than
[30:34.840 --> 30:39.040]  a year and now they're trying to bring the shutdown back again in fact areas like India
[30:39.040 --> 30:45.160]  and areas of Africa the shutdown is ongoing it's killing those people in massive numbers
[30:45.160 --> 30:48.880]  so the import war doesn't have a lot of our best-selling products anymore for six seven
[30:48.880 --> 30:53.960]  eight months because of this so to make up a shortfall please buy t-shirts books films

[31:00.720 --> 31:21.440]  to the Alex Jones show day after day alone on a hill the man with the foolish grin is
[31:21.440 --> 31:32.440]  keeping perfectly still but nobody wants to know him they can see that he's just a fool
[31:32.440 --> 31:42.240]  and he never gives an answer but the fool on the hill sees the sun going down and the
[31:42.240 --> 31:44.440]  eyes in his eyes.
[31:44.440 --> 31:51.560]  Ladies and gentlemen thank you for joining us today we're now thirty three minutes forty-five
[31:51.560 --> 31:58.880]  seconds into this Tuesday July 6 broadcast and I want to address the controversy that
[31:58.880 --> 32:08.560]  the struggling back of the line basement dwelling Brian Stelter and his salacious crumb
[32:08.560 --> 32:16.100]  sidekick Oliver Darcy have been trying to create they pushed heavily to have media platform
[32:16.100 --> 32:21.400]  and they are the mouth of Jeff Zucker the bitch admitted it's come out and project Veritas
[32:21.400 --> 32:26.400]  reports and others that he tells us specifically what to say they load up their teleprompters
[32:26.400 --> 32:32.880]  and so when you see Brian Stelter and he comes up like a puppet like a Humpty Dumpty get
[32:32.880 --> 32:42.720]  the clown crossover and you wonder why you know he and Oliver Darcy are so disingenuous
[32:42.720 --> 32:47.840]  but at the same time so powerful and that when they call for somebody to be the platform
[32:47.840 --> 32:52.280]  Twitter Facebook all of them just click their heels and do it it's because CNN takes the
[32:52.280 --> 32:57.320]  lead in propaganda and that's really a corporate agreement that is the mouth of Jeff Zucker
[32:57.320 --> 33:07.160]  saying to do that but imagine being so incredibly disconnected from reality like Brian hit the
[33:07.160 --> 33:14.600]  clown Stelter that if you go to his photos that he publicly puts out himself as glamour
[33:14.600 --> 33:22.040]  shots that he puts on his own PR pages it's a joke and I've said this before I'll say
[33:22.040 --> 33:29.040]  it again if I was in central casting for a director that was trying to find an actor
[33:29.040 --> 33:37.480]  that just radiated evil corruption and the destruction of children I mean I have to say
[33:37.480 --> 33:43.720]  he looks like in my mind what in hell a child molester would look like like you die you
[33:43.720 --> 33:47.800]  go to hell you're there for murder or whatever and you're in a fiery cell with somebody and
[33:47.800 --> 33:52.280]  what are you here for oh I'm Brian Stelter I'm a and I'm not saying the child molester
[33:52.280 --> 33:59.760]  I'm just saying who would hire someone who just radiates I'm a fraud I'm a liar I'm your
[33:59.760 --> 34:05.920]  enemy I'm a scammer and then hold that little creature up it's puppet and then speak through
[34:05.920 --> 34:12.600]  it and then ban free speech in America and call yourself a good person he's the worst
[34:12.600 --> 34:19.320]  thing on CNN Brian Williams is the worst thing on MSNBC and of course he's their fact checker
[34:19.320 --> 34:23.840]  over there when he's not saying he was shot down in helicopters I mean I've had Brian
[34:23.840 --> 34:32.680]  Williams fact check me that's like having Hitler sit as the chief judge in the Nuremberg
[34:32.680 --> 34:38.840]  trials after World War two I mean it's it's that crazy so I've been played part of this
[34:38.840 --> 34:42.560]  whole piece went on for like 15 minutes but I'm just gonna play like four minutes of it
[34:42.560 --> 34:47.640]  but but just remember everything they're saying is a fraud and I shouldn't try to judge a book
[34:47.640 --> 34:53.320]  off its cover it's just I'm simply asking is there anyone creep here on earth and Ryan
[34:53.320 --> 35:02.080]  Stelter and I think the answer is no and then he's got an equally creepy sidekick which
[35:02.080 --> 35:06.240]  again I'm just gonna ask you would you let these people anywhere near your life your
[35:06.240 --> 35:10.120]  children your business no but instead they work for the globalists they're destroying
[35:10.120 --> 35:14.600]  the country in the world and of course they do that they are central casting villains
[35:14.600 --> 35:20.440]  but then there's their action how they murder the truth I could pull up Reuters I could
[35:20.440 --> 35:25.160]  pull up even Associated Press that the majority of new polio cases in the world are from the
[35:25.160 --> 35:30.640]  Bill and Melinda Gates vaccine we put that on screen and I have an article right here
[35:30.640 --> 35:38.920]  from gavi.org funded by Bill Gates where it says it can shed and give people polio but
[35:38.920 --> 35:45.000]  Stelter's done pieces on me before saying that's a lie imagine covering up for the killing
[35:45.000 --> 35:49.840]  that's going on remember Fiona Hill and on 60 minutes and said I called her a globalist
[35:49.840 --> 35:54.360]  she doesn't know what that is meanwhile she's one of the main writers at theglobalist.com
[35:54.360 --> 35:59.160]  it's just like Klaus Schwab says I want you to have a world ID and I want you to have
[35:59.160 --> 36:02.960]  a microchip under you and we're going to use the fear of a virus to do it he said this
[36:02.960 --> 36:06.600]  five years ago and now it's happening I go hey they want to put a microchip in you and
[36:06.600 --> 36:13.600]  Stelter goes oh Jones is insane he's making that up and it goes on and on and on the examples
[36:13.600 --> 36:17.440]  of trying to gaslight us their brain and world government they're dissolving our borders
[36:17.440 --> 36:21.400]  they're telling us America shouldn't exist they're pushing all this Marxist ideology
[36:21.400 --> 36:26.840]  they're run by big banks that are tax exempt and then their rearguard action is these no
[36:26.840 --> 36:32.280]  viewer individuals that sit up there that we've rejected but they're like zombies the walking
[36:32.280 --> 36:37.680]  dead of media they're just propped up like a reanimated corpse by the big banks and then
[36:37.680 --> 36:44.120]  they call themselves the rebels fighting the establishment when they're the big globalist
[36:44.120 --> 36:49.720]  back media that still no one wants so this is the immobile object comes into the unstoppable
[36:49.720 --> 36:53.560]  force because no one wants everybody hates them but they're still not going away they're
[36:53.560 --> 36:59.880]  still trying to destroy us and drag us into oblivion with them here they are your own reality
[36:59.880 --> 37:05.880]  culture is pervading every corner of American life choose your own reality if you want to
[37:05.880 --> 37:10.600]  believe that the pro-trump riots January 6th were instigated by the feds you can choose
[37:10.600 --> 37:16.120]  a show that claims that is true you can choose a TV star who claims it's real if you want
[37:16.120 --> 37:21.720]  to believe the NSA is reading your favorite TV stars emails go right ahead he claims it's
[37:21.720 --> 37:27.120]  true the NSA denies it of course but for Tucker Carlson's fans that's just further proof of
[37:27.120 --> 37:32.680]  the plot Carlson is a conspiracy monger but he's far from the first as my colleague Oliver
[37:32.680 --> 37:39.040]  Darcy pointed out this week Carlson is sounding more and more like info wars host and notorious
[37:39.040 --> 37:47.040]  conspiracy theorist Alex Jones you can hear the similarities the NSA has been reading
[37:47.040 --> 37:52.560]  our emails it's not that I think the government spies on me it's admitted that they do it
[37:52.560 --> 37:57.840]  is a lie to say there are no risks the risks in everything including in getting a vaccine
[37:57.840 --> 38:04.040]  everybody's got family that got killed or got sick from a vaccine so FBI operatives were
[38:04.040 --> 38:11.040]  organizing the attack on the Capitol on January 6th according to government documents it is
[38:11.040 --> 38:19.440]  overwhelming the evidence that criminal elements of the federal government provocateur and stage
[38:19.440 --> 38:27.760]  January 6th all right Oliver Darcy is back with me I think the sound speaks for itself
[38:27.760 --> 38:32.840]  is it a stretch to say that Tucker Carlson is the new Alex Jones it's it's not a stretch
[38:32.840 --> 38:38.880]  Brian it Tucker Carlson is the new Alex Jones if you watch Tucker Carlson's program and you
[38:38.880 --> 38:43.480]  watch Alex Jones's program they might differ a little bit in antics and the way they deliver
[38:43.480 --> 38:48.280]  their message but that message to viewers is consistent and it's it's pretty identical
[38:48.280 --> 38:54.000]  whether it's talking about vaccine conspiracy theories false flag conspiracy theories deep
[38:54.000 --> 38:58.880]  state conspiracy theories the messages that Tucker Carlson and Alex Jones are sending
[38:58.880 --> 39:04.840]  are the same they they seem to see eye to eye on the biggest issues that they talk about
[39:04.840 --> 39:06.400]  every single night.
[39:06.400 --> 39:10.800]  Do we know anything about their relationship or do they have one because we play two back
[39:10.800 --> 39:16.280]  to back sound bites one is of Tucker sympathizing with Jones but the other one has Alex Jones
[39:16.280 --> 39:21.080]  basically saying hey yeah I'm gonna let Tucker present this January 6 conspiracy theory
[39:21.080 --> 39:25.920]  first I'm gonna let Tucker present the inside job theory because he's gonna do a great job
[39:25.920 --> 39:30.320]  with it and when I heard that I thought are these two guys in cahoots like are they friends
[39:30.320 --> 39:34.720]  do they communicate let's listen to these two sound bites and then we'll talk about it.
[39:34.720 --> 39:40.680]  I made the decision not to get into this until it broke on Tucker because I thought he'd
[39:40.680 --> 39:43.840]  do a better job than I did he did a great job in 15 minutes.
[39:43.840 --> 39:50.000]  Why do we laugh at Alex Jones against sincere question are they bros what do we know about
[39:50.000 --> 39:54.440]  the relationship it does sound like they're talking to each other right Brian look you
[39:54.440 --> 39:58.560]  don't have to take it from us just listen to that clip you played of Tucker Carlson
[39:58.560 --> 40:03.240]  he's basically saying that he doesn't think that Tucker Carl are that that Alex Jones's
[40:03.240 --> 40:07.600]  views are out there that they're crazy evidently he thinks that they're legitimate and should
[40:07.600 --> 40:12.920]  be debated and he's bringing them up on his own show and Brian this matters because these
[40:12.920 --> 40:18.120]  are far right conspiracy theories they used to be confined to the info war section on
[40:18.120 --> 40:22.480]  the internet you have to stop there the whole things on info wars it used to be confined
[40:22.480 --> 40:27.040]  you know you guys can call everybody's minds obviously Tucker's been on the show many times
[40:27.040 --> 40:31.680]  yes we're friends no I'm not telling Tucker what to do or what to say though Tucker is
[40:31.680 --> 40:36.600]  honored I guess at the comparison because info wars is seen as the tip of the spear
[40:36.600 --> 40:42.400]  the vanguard in waking up the world coming out of Plato's cave and saying no to the system
[40:42.400 --> 40:46.600]  and so no Tucker Carlson's not getting what he covers for me he sees the same thing just
[40:46.600 --> 40:51.720]  like the rest of the world does that's why no one watches CNN we see a bunch of creepy
[40:51.720 --> 40:56.920]  anti-American control freaks for what you are criminals the most important thing I've
[40:56.920 --> 41:01.920]  done in the last eight years for my health for a middle clarity for my focus has been
[41:01.920 --> 41:07.080]  deep earth crystal iodine Dr. Group hammered me and hammered me nine ten years ago and
[41:07.080 --> 41:12.200]  said Alex you've got to start taking deep earth crystal atomic iodine and when I finally
[41:12.200 --> 41:17.400]  started taking it it changed my life even the UN's own health website admits over two
[41:17.400 --> 41:23.360]  million people have cognitive disabilities lower IQ because of lack of iodine well we
[41:23.360 --> 41:29.480]  have two varieties of high quality iodine it'll blow you away on sale right now x2 there's
[41:29.480 --> 41:34.200]  deep earth crystal iodine and x3 there's tri iodine deep earth crystal iodine and two
[41:34.200 --> 41:38.320]  other types of some people need all three types of absorption so it's apples and oranges
[41:38.320 --> 41:42.560]  two different formulas some people like one better or the other but the point is they're

[41:58.040 --> 42:02.560]  the globalists are having their revolution but for humanity has to have its revolution
[42:02.560 --> 42:11.400]  we have to first recognize this anti-human takeovers trying to enslave the entire biological
[42:11.400 --> 42:20.880]  processes of humans and turn us into these artificial corporate controlled slaves worse
[42:20.880 --> 42:28.200]  than slaves so just property from cradle to grave of the system rendered down to be servile
[42:28.200 --> 42:34.480]  minions of the system and a ritual of dominance and satanic control we have to recognize the
[42:34.480 --> 42:38.920]  great reset post-industrial world which realizes a nightmare dystopia and we have to promote
[42:38.920 --> 42:44.520]  liberty and freedom that is the opposite of their dystopia it's that choice it's that
[42:44.520 --> 42:49.680]  realization that's going to change the world and it's the only choice we've got freedom
[42:49.680 --> 42:54.560]  or slavery go to evil it is a spiritual battle an info wars at the tip of the spear fighting
[42:54.560 --> 43:01.800]  it but the first world collapses the third world dies and we're seeing tens of millions
[43:01.800 --> 43:06.880]  of extra people in the third world now starved to death thanks to claus Schwab and bill gates
[43:06.880 --> 43:10.720]  the great reset they need to go to prison for what they've done and here in the u.s. we've
[43:10.720 --> 43:14.680]  seen more than half the small businesses go out of business and every major supplement
[43:14.680 --> 43:20.560]  supplier we've got is either closing or operating at minimum capacity because they can't even
[43:20.560 --> 43:25.320]  get product in for the raw material ladies and gentlemen that's why it's more important
[43:25.320 --> 43:30.680]  to ever to realize that the products we do have available at info wars store dot com are
[43:30.680 --> 43:35.600]  the product sales that are keeping us on air and I know you're always used to big sales
[43:35.600 --> 43:39.360]  and so you don't buy the products until they're on sale so it's a catch for me to we have
[43:39.360 --> 43:43.440]  less of the product and we're still selling it at a huge discount I don't know how long
[43:43.440 --> 43:46.640]  are you keep doing this but for now it's a catch for me to I've got to have the money

[45:08.920 --> 45:38.360]  waging war on corruption crashing for the lies and disinformation the american way is
[45:38.360 --> 45:43.720]  to let all ideas out there in the belief that the best ideas will prove themselves become
[45:43.720 --> 45:50.840]  dominant which is what made this country so great now big foreign owned corporate media
[45:50.840 --> 45:59.360]  that literally sponsors games for the communist chinese military in the Uighur region where
[45:59.360 --> 46:04.640]  they have 3 million people in slave camps that very same corporate media that censors
[46:04.640 --> 46:11.480]  us helps run the slave camps like apple and nikey but then they fund the tip of the spear
[46:11.480 --> 46:18.480]  of wokeness and finance a bunch of out of control black supremacist to talk about how
[46:18.480 --> 46:26.400]  bad white people are on all their hit tv shows it's incredible i've started monitoring some
[46:26.400 --> 46:37.080]  of the top black podcast and man it is the most vile racist crazy talk and not a word
[46:37.080 --> 46:41.640]  about africa starvin that's not a word about poison vaccines all about how black people
[46:41.640 --> 46:46.960]  are the master race and the whole world's black and black search superior and i guess
[46:46.960 --> 46:51.560]  if you are one of the people that works for the system apple or google or whatever and
[46:51.560 --> 46:58.080]  you know you're getting their money and then you're up there and every sponsorship every
[46:58.080 --> 47:03.720]  spokesperson is black and that's not because the system likes black people the system is
[47:03.720 --> 47:11.520]  taking on the camouflage saying their corporations are black or woke while their corporations
[47:11.520 --> 47:17.200]  are destroying the entire world and engage in a global lockdown that's already starved
[47:17.200 --> 47:26.920]  at least 20 million extra people to death and the majority of them you bet were african
[47:26.920 --> 47:35.200]  and so it's very frustrating to hear some big black woke podcaster calling me a racist
[47:35.200 --> 47:38.360]  taking things out of context i've said here or there or whatever when i'm having larger
[47:38.360 --> 47:48.640]  debates to then say alex jones should be the platformed but then they don't even stand
[47:48.640 --> 47:53.120]  up for the 50 plus percent of black people never get out of their momma's wombs it's
[47:53.120 --> 47:58.880]  just so sad but that said i'll get more into that in the next hour we were talking about
[47:58.880 --> 48:05.920]  brian stelter and oliver darcy who i i mean i really shouldn't talk about their appearance
[48:05.920 --> 48:09.560]  because i've gotten older i'm not as good looking as i used to be and i got a few miles
[48:09.560 --> 48:14.880]  on me uh and i don't normally back over how they look it's stelter so fake and he tries
[48:14.880 --> 48:21.200]  to pull up brian stelter with tom brokaw no no it's not tom brokaw it was brian stelter
[48:21.200 --> 48:26.240]  with ted koppel and and and ted koppel's running circles around him and stelter is
[48:26.240 --> 48:34.560]  just sitting back all arrogant trying to look officious and powerful and it's just so fake
[48:34.560 --> 48:43.000]  and then you see what he stands for what he does how he lies and how he's self appointed
[48:43.000 --> 48:48.040]  and the whole corporate system gets behind him of of who he says can be on air and who
[48:48.040 --> 48:57.480]  can't imagine being so self unaware that you put out a face that looks like it's a horror
[48:57.480 --> 49:08.080]  movie cover but that's that's who these people are they're the self appointed individuals
[49:08.080 --> 49:12.280]  that believe it's their right to rule over us and to control our lives and they've got
[49:12.280 --> 49:16.520]  all the stolen money and all the big banks behind them and but they've got a chip on
[49:16.520 --> 49:21.960]  their shoulder because they know they're creepy they know they're weird they know they've got
[49:21.960 --> 49:32.360]  sick ideas and they're not going to stop until we stop them and we just stop them by exposing
[49:32.360 --> 49:37.800]  what monsters they are and we all let them know that they are fully rejected and that
[49:37.800 --> 49:42.040]  we know who they are but let me finish up with a clip I was just playing of them not
[49:42.040 --> 49:45.360]  going to play the whole thing and then I'm going to some very very serious news here
[49:45.360 --> 49:51.480]  they are like well do we know if they're talking well do we know if they're in cahoots are they
[49:51.480 --> 49:56.160]  we better and of course every show they call for Tucker Carlson to be taken off the air
[49:56.160 --> 50:01.880]  the ADL does the Southern Property Law Center the Democratic Party because what's Carlson
[50:01.880 --> 50:06.840]  talking about populism and stopping fentanyl death and getting jobs back in America and
[50:06.840 --> 50:11.680]  unifying Americans and it's because he is likable and it's because what he's saying
[50:11.680 --> 50:16.640]  is so common sense they have to misrepresent it and use somebody they think's demonized
[50:16.640 --> 50:22.160]  somebody they think's defeated Alex Jones and go oh look Tucker's that now when they're
[50:22.160 --> 50:27.000]  living in their own fantasy land info wars in many ways especially when it comes just
[50:27.000 --> 50:33.040]  to general public knowing we're dead on is more popular than it's ever been by orders
[50:33.040 --> 50:39.760]  of magnitude but these guys actually think they're going to hurt Tucker Carlson associating
[50:39.760 --> 50:44.800]  Alex Jones with him because Tucker Carlson is the king of mainstream media because he
[50:44.800 --> 50:50.720]  is a populist well info wars and what we do here is the tip of the spear worldwide and
[50:50.720 --> 50:56.040]  recognizes that so I'm not in a competition with Brian Stelter I'm trying to show the
[50:56.040 --> 51:03.040]  world through this grain of sand a microcosm of who the establishment is but why would
[51:03.040 --> 51:07.400]  they pick someone so disingenuous and so creepy and such a liar because it makes them feel
[51:07.400 --> 51:13.720]  comfortable because he's spiritually stunted and spiritually ugly like they are and it
[51:13.720 --> 51:23.520]  shines through his very cells who he is so let's hear some more from this creature trying
[51:23.520 --> 51:30.840]  to sit up there as the traffic cop as the hall monitor and and and and who are when
[51:30.840 --> 51:35.160]  they know full well Carlson's been on the show many times they know full well all of
[51:35.160 --> 51:41.560]  that but they were not like who is it a secret like oh we've got this secret video of Jones
[51:41.560 --> 51:46.440]  saying he's mad at Trump I said the documentary and it was they didn't have the rest of the
[51:46.440 --> 51:50.880]  story saying but I love Trump I had mad him a lot love hate but I love Trump they edited
[51:50.880 --> 51:55.640]  that out it's the same thing it's all about deceiving because they're not selling things
[51:55.640 --> 52:00.320]  that are popular they're promoting things that are not popular so they've got to always lie
[52:00.320 --> 52:04.080]  and to see how much they can sucker people and as their ratings implode as they fall
[52:04.080 --> 52:09.520]  apart they just double down the lies because it's all they know because it's because their
[52:09.520 --> 52:15.040]  father is and it's who they are here here is the self-appointed self-anointed empty
[52:15.040 --> 52:20.600]  dumpy present the inside job theory because he's going to do a great job with it and when
[52:20.600 --> 52:25.200]  I heard that I thought are these two guys in cahoots like are they friends do they communicate
[52:25.200 --> 52:29.520]  let's listen to these two sound bites and then we'll talk about it I made the decision
[52:29.520 --> 52:35.280]  not to get into this until it broke on Tucker because I thought he'd do a better job than
[52:35.280 --> 52:39.280]  I did he did he did a great job in 15 minutes why do we laugh at Alex Jones again since
[52:39.280 --> 52:45.960]  your question are they bros what do we know about the relationship it does sound like
[52:45.960 --> 52:50.440]  they're talking to each other right Brian look you don't have to take it from us just
[52:50.440 --> 52:54.920]  listen to that clip you played of Tucker Carlson he's basically saying that he doesn't think
[52:54.920 --> 52:59.960]  that Tucker are that that Alex Jones's views are out there that they're crazy evidently
[52:59.960 --> 53:03.720]  he thinks that they're legitimate and should be debated and he's bringing them up on his
[53:03.720 --> 53:09.320]  own show and Brian this matters because these are far right conspiracy theories they used
[53:09.320 --> 53:13.560]  to be confined to the info war section on the Internet you have to just have to seek
[53:13.560 --> 53:19.360]  them out not that old but I remember when the Republican Party and Fox News mocked Alex
[53:19.360 --> 53:24.880]  Jones and said that guy is crazy we're not going to touch that sort of stuff that's
[53:24.880 --> 53:29.260]  before we completely prove we were right everything came true like we said and you two little
[53:29.260 --> 53:38.160]  envious Nellie's candy asses sit up there and just look so envious and so upset about
[53:38.160 --> 53:43.120]  Tucker Carlson and Alex Jones yeah don't you guys wish you were popular don't you wish
[53:43.120 --> 53:47.720]  you were cool don't you wish you had great wives don't you wish you had great families
[53:47.720 --> 53:55.400]  but you don't because you're little devils so yes you're not taking us with you yes
[53:55.400 --> 53:59.200]  so we have worldwide bigger audience than ever more popular than ever but when it comes to
[53:59.200 --> 54:03.880]  sponsorship these guys went after all my sponsors hundreds of them harassed them till they went
[54:03.880 --> 54:07.760]  away I've got a major lawsuit if I want it but I'm not going to go there the point is
[54:07.760 --> 54:13.240]  is that you keep us on air and these little monsters can't stand it so we're extending
[54:13.240 --> 54:20.040]  the July 4th super sale until Saturday four more days free shipping double patriot points

[57:20.840 --> 57:50.560]  you're listening to the
[57:50.560 --> 58:20.520]  Alex Jones show very important article and video report that I'm gonna
[58:20.520 --> 58:26.840]  play right now and I'm gonna get more into this next segment is dealing with the so-called
[58:26.840 --> 58:32.320]  delta variant and the police state that ties into this new Lando variant I guess it's Lando
[58:32.320 --> 58:39.160]  Calrissian so we're gonna be breaking all that down on the other side here is the report
[58:39.160 --> 58:45.200]  delta variant expands indefinite lockdown your leaders in Canada saying they're using
[58:45.200 --> 58:52.320]  covid to bring in martial law to silence dissent they say it in national TV press conferences
[58:52.320 --> 58:58.120]  they are going public with tyranny and now Biden has launched the covid tracking teams
[58:58.120 --> 59:05.360]  in the name of the delta tracking teams the delta plus variant tracking teams coming door
[59:05.360 --> 59:11.400]  to door to harass the unvaccinated this is the iron fist I'm here to talk to you today
[59:11.400 --> 59:21.520]  about the delta variant that causes covid-19 well anyone who is not vaccinated is most
[59:21.520 --> 59:29.200]  at risk younger people are less likely to be vaccinated that puts the entire cohort
[59:29.200 --> 59:37.480]  of younger people at greater risk we need everyone to get vaccinated we do this together
[59:37.480 --> 59:42.680]  by July the 4th there's a good chance you your families and friends will be able to
[59:42.680 --> 59:48.520]  celebrate independence day that will make this independence day something truly special
[59:48.520 --> 59:53.080]  when I got vaccinated the first thing on my mind was I can finally see my friends and
[59:53.080 --> 59:57.680]  go out to dinner before more comfortable taking our children out and about seeing my family
[59:57.680 --> 1:00:02.880]  hugging my grandchildren again hanging out together being fully vaccinated being vaccinated
[1:00:02.880 --> 1:00:07.320]  means I can walk at my college graduation I was able to marry the girl of my dreams
[1:00:07.320 --> 1:00:12.960]  we tend to use the word isolation for someone who is a case confirmed we tend to use the
[1:00:12.960 --> 1:00:18.520]  word quarantine for someone who's at risk of being a case usually a contact so on that
[1:00:18.520 --> 1:00:25.000]  basis we advise that all suspect cases are tested and all suspect cases are isolated
[1:00:25.000 --> 1:00:30.160]  in an appropriate medical facility in low incidence areas where there is sporadic cases
[1:00:30.160 --> 1:00:36.880]  or clusters we advise that all contacts should be quarantined ideally that quarantine should
[1:00:36.880 --> 1:00:42.560]  occur in a place other than the home they did that with community workers with public
[1:00:42.560 --> 1:00:47.760]  health workers visiting the houses checking on people checking their health status every
[1:00:47.760 --> 1:00:52.720]  day and saying how are you have you got a fever have you got a cough and if a contact is developed
[1:00:52.720 --> 1:00:58.960]  a cough or a fever they were taken immediately for testing now we need to go and look in
[1:00:58.960 --> 1:01:04.920]  families to find those people who may be sick and remove them and isolate them in a in a
[1:01:04.920 --> 1:01:10.360]  safe and dignified manner ladies and gentlemen that's how sick these people are casting themselves
[1:01:10.360 --> 1:01:17.680]  as the heroes the rest of us is the evil disease spreaders and now biden the wide house to
[1:01:17.680 --> 1:01:24.120]  deploy delta variant response teams across the u.s. two communities with low vaccination
[1:01:24.120 --> 1:01:28.920]  rates and they're going to force their way into homes and quote force people to be tested
[1:01:28.920 --> 1:01:34.680]  with fraudulent machines that are 94% false positive and it's far worse than that already
[1:01:34.680 --> 1:01:40.240]  in europe canada places like australia where they have been arresting people for a year
[1:01:40.240 --> 1:01:46.480]  that protests online now you're under arrest in relation to incitement incitement a young
[1:01:46.480 --> 1:01:52.840]  mother still in her pajamas is cuffed what an earth excuse me what what's an earth slapped

[1:01:59.200 --> 1:02:04.960]  ballerat detectives were determined to question zoe buehler after the 28-year-old allegedly
[1:02:04.960 --> 1:02:10.320]  created this freedom day facebook event asking her friends to remember the 5th of september
[1:02:10.320 --> 1:02:14.480]  i wasn't breaking any laws by the way you are actually you are bragging well that's
[1:02:14.480 --> 1:02:19.320]  why i'm arresting you in relation to how can you arrest her that's one of my two children
[1:02:19.320 --> 1:02:24.640]  the former cleaner turned candle maker has posted that covet is a hoax and police alleged
[1:02:24.640 --> 1:02:30.120]  she was behind an anti-lockdown demonstration similar to those planned in major cities across
[1:02:30.120 --> 1:02:35.000]  the world this saturday they also censored medical treatment medical doctors this is
[1:02:35.000 --> 1:02:42.040]  a giant exercise in raping our freedoms raping our speech raping our bodies enforcing their
[1:02:42.040 --> 1:02:47.440]  deadly gene therapies into us i got mainstream news going we don't know why they're doing
[1:02:47.440 --> 1:02:54.600]  that i mean whoa who's giving the directives grab the clipboard find out what the directions
[1:02:54.600 --> 1:02:59.760]  are the first world collapses the third world dies and we're seeing tens of millions of
[1:02:59.760 --> 1:03:04.720]  extra people in the third world now starved to death thanks to claus Schwab and bill gates
[1:03:04.720 --> 1:03:08.520]  the great reset they need to go to prison for what they've done and here in the u.s. we've
[1:03:08.520 --> 1:03:12.520]  seen more than half the small businesses go out of business and every major supplement
[1:03:12.520 --> 1:03:17.400]  supplier we've got is either closing or operating at minimum capacity because they
[1:03:17.400 --> 1:03:22.640]  can't even get product in for the raw material ladies and gentlemen that's why it's more
[1:03:22.640 --> 1:03:28.120]  important to ever to realize that the products we do have available at info or store dot com
[1:03:28.120 --> 1:03:33.440]  are the product sales are keeping us on air and i know you're always used to big sales
[1:03:33.440 --> 1:03:37.520]  and so you don't buy the products until they're on sale so it's a catch 22 we have less of
[1:03:37.520 --> 1:03:41.520]  the product and we're still selling it at a huge discount i don't know how long i can
[1:03:41.520 --> 1:03:45.480]  keep doing this but for now it's a catch 22 i've got to have the money come in so please

[1:04:22.440 --> 1:04:31.720]  charlie monger is an interesting old double charlie monger agrees with bill gates and
[1:04:31.720 --> 1:04:37.440]  warren buffett and ted turner and a bunch of other really creepy people like david rocker
[1:04:37.440 --> 1:04:42.400]  feller when he was alive that there are too many people on the world and you could argue
[1:04:42.400 --> 1:04:47.280]  that in some cases and i do think we're destructive and i do that we should be good stewards but
[1:04:47.280 --> 1:04:53.920]  they've self appointed themselves to be authoritarians and to live like kings over us and and for
[1:04:53.920 --> 1:05:00.440]  us to have no rights and and that's just an excuse they use to lord over us and charlie
[1:05:00.440 --> 1:05:09.600]  monger attends the meetings that they have had to discuss establishing a world government

[1:14:57.640 --> 1:15:04.480]  profits so is Amazon because they designed the global shutdown to destroy small and medium
[1:15:04.480 --> 1:15:13.280]  sized businesses and it is wreaking havoc in the supply chain thousands of small companies
[1:15:13.280 --> 1:15:19.640]  have completely shut down and others are struggling to stay open because they can't get raw materials
[1:15:19.640 --> 1:15:23.280]  whether it's for food whether it's for medicine whether it's for supplements whether it's
[1:15:23.280 --> 1:15:29.080]  for textiles whatever the product is you see it in the news it is record level supply chain
[1:15:29.080 --> 1:15:33.040]  breakdowns because the globalists shut down the world of comics for more than a year and
[1:15:33.040 --> 1:15:37.280]  now they're trying to bring the shutdown back again in fact areas like india and areas of
[1:15:37.280 --> 1:15:43.760]  africa the shutdown is ongoing it's killing those people in massive numbers so the import
[1:15:43.760 --> 1:15:47.160]  wars doesn't have a lot of our best selling products anymore for six seven eight months
[1:15:47.160 --> 1:15:51.960]  because of this so to make up the shortfall please buy t-shirts books films things like
[1:15:51.960 --> 1:15:58.240]  that at importwar.com and please try to keep us on the air the globalists are having their
[1:15:58.240 --> 1:16:04.240]  revolution but for humanity has to have its revolution we have to first recognize this
[1:16:04.240 --> 1:16:12.840]  anti-human takeovers trying to enslave the entire biological processes of humans and
[1:16:12.840 --> 1:16:22.240]  turn us into these artificial corporate controlled slaves worse than slaves just just property
[1:16:22.240 --> 1:16:28.360]  from cradle to grave of the system rendered down to be servile minions of the system
[1:16:28.360 --> 1:16:34.680]  and a ritual of dominance and satanic control we have to recognize the great reset post
[1:16:34.680 --> 1:16:38.520]  industrial world which realizes a nightmare dystopia and we have to promote liberty and
[1:16:38.520 --> 1:16:44.440]  freedom that is the opposite of their dystopia it's that choice it's that realization that's
[1:16:44.440 --> 1:16:49.600]  going to change the world and it's the only choice we've got freedom or slavery go to
[1:16:49.600 --> 1:16:58.480]  evil it is a spiritual battle and info wars at the tip of the spear fighting it you're
[1:16:58.480 --> 1:17:23.480]  listening to the alex jones show
[1:17:23.480 --> 1:17:39.480]  the first thing i met was a fly with a buzz and a sky with no clouds the heat was hot
[1:17:39.480 --> 1:17:48.480]  and the ground was dry but the air was full of sound i've been through the desert on a
[1:17:48.480 --> 1:17:56.720]  no name it felt good to be out of the rain in the desert welcome back i'm going to cover
[1:17:56.720 --> 1:18:00.160]  news for this segment a little bit of the next and then i want to open the phones up
[1:18:00.160 --> 1:18:07.280]  for first time callers on a host of issues but as long as it's first time callers you're
[1:18:07.280 --> 1:18:12.720]  welcome to call in on any topic you want i'm going to throw out a few topics at the end
[1:18:12.720 --> 1:18:15.560]  of the segment that i would like to hear you comment on and then you're welcome to bring
[1:18:15.560 --> 1:18:19.560]  up any point you'd like but i wouldn't like you to humor me and give me your two cents
[1:18:19.560 --> 1:18:25.240]  on a few of the topics that i put forward but first let's hit some more of the covet
[1:18:25.240 --> 1:18:32.440]  rollout operation remember you could never make a vaccine for the common cold because
[1:18:32.440 --> 1:18:36.080]  there's a bunch of viruses that can cause it corona being the dominant one thousands
[1:18:36.080 --> 1:18:42.760]  of variants that are known and so you you you can't make a vaccine so they said oh we'll
[1:18:42.760 --> 1:18:51.160]  make it for the protein of the coronavirus and then we'll create an artificial one that
[1:18:51.160 --> 1:18:57.160]  has a particularly strong gain of function protein spike and it just so happens that
[1:18:57.160 --> 1:19:01.480]  type of protein is in the uterus is in the heart is in the lungs is in the brain and
[1:19:01.480 --> 1:19:06.560]  is in the testicles and a bunch of other places so lo and behold the body then starts attacking
[1:19:06.560 --> 1:19:13.360]  itself amongst other things then if you get a regular coronavirus you get deathly ill
[1:19:13.360 --> 1:19:19.760]  from the vaccine you've taken or you've already been vaccinated and you come into contact
[1:19:19.760 --> 1:19:25.560]  with the coronavirus you get really sick or if you've already had corona and then get
[1:19:25.560 --> 1:19:31.320]  the vaccine you get really sick this is all confirmed mainline literature but when you
[1:19:31.320 --> 1:19:40.640]  talk about it ABC NBC CBS CNN MSNBC they go it's preposterous no one's ever gotten sick
[1:19:40.640 --> 1:19:46.920]  there's no side effects it's wonderful meanwhile they have an advisory on the Pfizer and Moderna
[1:19:46.920 --> 1:19:51.920]  injections that it can cause a heart attack or stroke they had to put it on there and
[1:19:51.920 --> 1:19:56.440]  it's experimental still and hasn't gotten FDA approval but all over the news they say
[1:19:56.440 --> 1:20:06.240]  why the FDA tested this and it's just totally wonderful it's just been banned all over the
[1:20:06.240 --> 1:20:13.040]  world I mean this is a bold raping but they think America is so drunk on entertainment
[1:20:13.040 --> 1:20:18.600]  so drunk on information of disinformation that this will all just get lost in the fog
[1:20:18.600 --> 1:20:23.880]  well my neighbor had a stroke or my neighbor's dad or my child got real sick or my mom died
[1:20:23.880 --> 1:20:31.200]  from it or I had a stroke from it well they're not sure the doctors just don't know because
[1:20:31.200 --> 1:20:35.520]  they never did studies they never did tests to know to get it approved so they just released
[1:20:35.520 --> 1:20:42.520]  something they'd secretly done studies on knowing it actually killed lab rats and ferrets
[1:20:42.520 --> 1:20:50.040]  and other things that were given vaccines that counter the corona protein casing and
[1:20:50.040 --> 1:20:55.720]  I can show you those damn studies University of Texas funded by Fauci you name it we've
[1:20:55.720 --> 1:21:01.320]  done hundreds of shows on them but it's so frustrating to watch the news lie to people
[1:21:01.320 --> 1:21:07.200]  and block treatments for so many folks that died from the flu and pneumonia because remember
[1:21:07.200 --> 1:21:10.440]  the first six months of the lockdown they said oh don't go to the hospital unless you
[1:21:10.440 --> 1:21:16.120]  really can't breathe well I mean we've gotten weak we've gotten soft without antivirals
[1:21:16.120 --> 1:21:23.240]  and without antibacterials people would die people used to die all the time from colds
[1:21:23.240 --> 1:21:28.920]  and flu until antibiotics and antivirals in the last fifty sixty years and so now countless
[1:21:28.920 --> 1:21:34.760]  people died at home because they never went and got treatment and they died of pneumonia
[1:21:34.760 --> 1:21:40.320]  and the flu and the system knew damn well what it did and those that did go in got innovated
[1:21:40.320 --> 1:21:47.440]  even though with COVID-19 that'll kill you so report US Army directs commands to prep
[1:21:47.440 --> 1:21:54.200]  for mandatory COVID shots for troops this is out of the Army Times pending full food
[1:21:54.200 --> 1:22:04.800]  drug administration licensure from the Army Times report not approved pending pending
[1:22:04.800 --> 1:22:11.240]  not but again I know all of you've seen the news say oh the FDA totally tested this lying
[1:22:11.240 --> 1:22:18.880]  to you of course if they'll if they'll block up known treatments to get kill numbers up
[1:22:18.880 --> 1:22:25.480]  these these are evil people and by extension they're mass murders I mean the average news
[1:22:25.480 --> 1:22:29.920]  person didn't know this they know it now and when they discover it they get fired or they
[1:22:29.920 --> 1:22:40.000]  get fined or they get suspended because the corporate order came down from the UN and
[1:22:40.000 --> 1:22:46.760]  Bill Gates and Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett who all want to depopulate us these
[1:22:46.760 --> 1:22:52.120]  old men that love communist China and love authoritarianism and love death camps and
[1:22:52.120 --> 1:23:00.720]  want us to die but they got a shot right in our arm because they care about it so much
[1:23:00.720 --> 1:23:08.880]  and now we got another old man here Jim Justice Governor Jim Justice declared Monday that anyone
[1:23:08.880 --> 1:23:14.240]  who choose or not to take the COVID vaccination entering is enduring themselves to a death
[1:23:14.240 --> 1:23:22.640]  lottery talk about a Freudian slip they are entering themselves into a death lottery when
[1:23:22.640 --> 1:23:26.520]  you take an unapproved gene therapy that they couldn't get approved for decades because
[1:23:26.520 --> 1:23:31.560]  it killed so many of the lab rats in studies they just said we have an emergency no studies
[1:23:31.560 --> 1:23:36.920]  put it in the general public so that so many doctors and scientists and lawyers would have
[1:23:36.920 --> 1:23:41.640]  signed on to this that they'll want to defend themselves now and cover up when it all comes
[1:23:41.640 --> 1:23:48.640]  out that it's sterilizing and killing people in mass curious thing oh you need to take
[1:23:48.640 --> 1:23:53.600]  this you're entering a death lottery like Russian roulette no it's you trying to force
[1:23:53.600 --> 1:24:01.200]  us into a death lottery trying to suppress vitamin D3 zinc iodine and vitamin C and trying
[1:24:01.200 --> 1:24:06.840]  to suppress the damn treatments you're the one Jim Justice that signed on to the lies
[1:24:06.840 --> 1:24:14.120]  because you're a political whore of the New World Order you're not a man of the people
[1:24:14.120 --> 1:24:23.000]  here he is you know the the red states probably have a lot of people that you know are very
[1:24:23.000 --> 1:24:28.280]  very conservative in their thinking and and they think well I don't have to do that but
[1:24:28.280 --> 1:24:33.480]  you're not thinking right when it really boils right down to it they're in a lottery to themselves
[1:24:33.480 --> 1:24:38.760]  you know we have a lottery you know that basically says if you're vaccinated we're going to give
[1:24:38.760 --> 1:24:44.760]  you stuff well you've got another lottery going on and it's the death lottery talking
[1:24:44.760 --> 1:24:51.680]  to us like we're five years old Jim Justice yeah oh now they admit the vaccine doesn't
[1:24:51.680 --> 1:24:57.280]  work and oh you know you got to have a lot more because now there's all these other variants
[1:24:57.280 --> 1:25:03.600]  that are and it's all made up fake PCR tests 94% false positives sending sick people in
[1:25:03.600 --> 1:25:07.720]  nursing homes to get the death numbers up these people have followed the criminal orders
[1:25:07.720 --> 1:25:13.240]  of Bill Gates and the globalist and the Bilderberg group and the club of Rome and the Davos group
[1:25:13.240 --> 1:25:17.520]  and Klaus Schwab through the corporate America and have committed massive crimes against
[1:25:17.520 --> 1:25:24.080]  humanity and we need Nuremberg 2.0 against these dirtbags I'm going to give the number
[1:25:24.080 --> 1:25:28.240]  out we come back I have not gone through any of the stack yet I'll give you the topics
[1:25:28.240 --> 1:25:35.760]  I want to cover also as well as the war on privacy as the war on women and children accelerates
[1:25:35.760 --> 1:25:41.960]  the pivot of the spear being the transgender movement police now saying hey if you're six

[1:29:48.760 --> 1:29:54.880]  just schmucks that are being sanguiated being sucked dry by the system but they have stock

[1:31:40.240 --> 1:31:45.520]  had sex with a lot of women and the police are called they said how dare you at that
[1:31:45.520 --> 1:31:51.200]  gym in california at that spot the articles on info wars dot com woman who complained
[1:31:51.200 --> 1:31:55.640]  to police about man exposing his genitalia their six-year-old daughter says they blamed
[1:31:55.640 --> 1:32:01.000]  her that sounds unbelievable remember what chris qualmo did four years ago a school
[1:32:01.000 --> 1:32:09.680]  complained about a transgender coach who hadn't had his uh trousers snake removed his johnson
[1:32:09.680 --> 1:32:16.800]  and boom they're in the shower the girls get freaked out eleven-year-old and qualmo said
[1:32:16.800 --> 1:32:24.240]  hey your daughter shouldn't get upset by seeing a woman's penis that's a quote you shouldn't
[1:32:24.240 --> 1:32:31.920]  get upset about a woman's penis think about that and that's the type of upside down world
[1:32:31.920 --> 1:32:39.160]  they teach us he said you should teach tolerance on girls not wanting to see male genitalia
[1:32:39.160 --> 1:32:49.680]  in the locker room parents should teach tolerance let's continue georgian protesters storm lgbt
[1:32:49.680 --> 1:32:56.240]  offices tear down pride flags and replace them with national flag i know it's in georgian
[1:32:56.240 --> 1:33:04.200]  dialect but let's roll it with some of the audio if you can because again they put it
[1:33:04.200 --> 1:33:08.400]  up above the georgian flag people get this is a conquering i was in new york a few weeks
[1:33:08.400 --> 1:33:16.080]  ago you saw more lgbt flags and pedo flags and something else people just had enough
[1:33:16.080 --> 1:33:27.240]  they understand it's an attack not even the soviets went after the basic biology but what's
[1:33:27.240 --> 1:33:32.480]  in the national strategy for countering domestic terrorism put out last month by biden it says
[1:33:32.480 --> 1:33:39.920]  questioning the election questioning lockdowns questioning everything is evil and is bad
[1:33:39.920 --> 1:33:44.960]  meanwhile in austin provides rapid permitting for developers who sponsor communism they
[1:33:44.960 --> 1:33:50.440]  actually say that oh they're going to give extra money reparations to black people it's
[1:33:50.440 --> 1:33:54.480]  about who controls the money and giving it to certain groups taking from certain groups
[1:33:54.480 --> 1:34:02.480]  giving to others to politically by control of people and to get total control that's
[1:34:02.480 --> 1:34:06.800]  just some of the news that we've got here but in case you're doubting me here's the
[1:34:06.800 --> 1:34:12.200]  actual article by paul joseph watson at info wars dot com that links to local news woman
[1:34:12.200 --> 1:34:17.080]  who complained to police about a man that's what he is exposing his in a telly to a six
[1:34:17.080 --> 1:34:27.600]  year old daughter says they blamed her yes really the incident occurred at the now notorious
[1:34:27.600 --> 1:34:34.240]  we spa in los angeles side of the protest and counter protest on saturday over another
[1:34:34.240 --> 1:34:38.640]  similar incident during which a biological male exposed to genitals to women and little
[1:34:38.640 --> 1:34:43.320]  girls in the female area they said he said do you like my penis i've had sex with lots
[1:34:43.320 --> 1:34:47.920]  of women according to the women who wishes were anonymous for obvious reasons the incident
[1:34:47.920 --> 1:34:52.200]  happened in january 2020 and notice if you do this at a park you get arrested but because
[1:34:52.200 --> 1:34:58.760]  it's in the bathroom with the lefts upset obsessed with poop and pee and they put little artificial
[1:34:58.760 --> 1:35:03.440]  penises in little girls baby diapers to teach them to say i want a penis i mean they're
[1:35:03.440 --> 1:35:09.720]  they're just pedophiles folks it all happened to me so i had a relapse of these feelings
[1:35:09.720 --> 1:35:14.520]  after having forgotten them she told the post wheel i knew it was a family spa and i decided
[1:35:14.520 --> 1:35:19.720]  to take my daughter it's kind of trendy well of course it's a 24 hour spa 90 plus percent
[1:35:19.720 --> 1:35:24.440]  korean and then a small percentage of people who aren't korean it's kind of cool participate
[1:35:24.440 --> 1:35:31.000]  in other cultural experiences the biological male who had a beard sat down at one end of
[1:35:31.000 --> 1:35:37.040]  the hot tub with two female companions immediately making every particularly uncomfortable especially
[1:35:37.040 --> 1:35:42.400]  the older korean woman women so they're in a korean spa with a bunch of old korean women
[1:35:42.400 --> 1:35:46.420]  in the back room you know because the hot tubs in the men's area and it's in the women's
[1:35:46.420 --> 1:35:50.480]  area it's separate the older korean ladies were whispering to each other holding their
[1:35:50.480 --> 1:35:56.040]  towels over themselves i mean i thought this is sick as all the women started whispering
[1:35:56.040 --> 1:36:01.800]  to each other said the mother and the biological male could see all the naked women as well
[1:36:01.800 --> 1:36:06.760]  as their six year old girl so you got a bunch of women naked in the hot tub having their
[1:36:06.760 --> 1:36:11.840]  own bonding family groups and no here's the man with a beard probably a homeless dude
[1:36:11.840 --> 1:36:16.400]  although careful not to overplay the race card the women noted that the three protagonists
[1:36:16.400 --> 1:36:22.120]  were all white privileged progressive people of course the mother was promoted and prompted
[1:36:22.120 --> 1:36:27.960]  by the six year old irate father to make a formal complaint the cops at a police station
[1:36:27.960 --> 1:36:32.480]  near the spa in korea town see now i know where the left wants to get rid of single
[1:36:32.480 --> 1:36:36.880]  family dwellings because pretty soon you'll be saving your house oh sorry zuckerberg wants

[1:36:41.360 --> 1:36:45.520]  you're going to be in 200 square foot deal with these guys she was told the spa is private
[1:36:45.520 --> 1:36:52.560]  business and they can do what they want but one offer officer i have a total read today
[1:36:52.560 --> 1:36:56.680]  i don't mind problems she was told that the spa is a private business and that they can
[1:36:56.680 --> 1:37:02.640]  do what they want but one officer blame me for having taken her daughter to the spa
[1:37:02.640 --> 1:37:08.880]  the woman said oh you didn't know that spas are sexual bathhouses now she also revealed
[1:37:08.880 --> 1:37:14.720]  that we spot justified the behavior by saying the individual was pre op trans person oh pre
[1:37:14.720 --> 1:37:20.760]  op the mother attended the protest outside we spawn saturday but quickly left her seeing
[1:37:20.760 --> 1:37:25.840]  that it had been hijacked by violent antipathogs who proceeded to beat up and harass those who
[1:37:25.840 --> 1:37:30.760]  showed up to oppose the idea of children being exposed to males in italia so that's anti
[1:37:30.760 --> 1:37:35.760]  for now beating up asian women because they don't want their six-year-old to see a bearded
[1:37:35.760 --> 1:37:42.600]  man's genitals and if you call him a man in california they arrest you but you can give

[1:37:56.960 --> 1:38:02.520]  family they are anti god they are anti everything they're cutting off our pipelines dissolving
[1:38:02.520 --> 1:38:08.440]  our borders bankrupting our currency starting wars arming our enemies and attacking our
[1:38:08.440 --> 1:38:15.000]  privacy and beating up asians in the street to go to a protest because they want to be
[1:38:15.000 --> 1:38:21.760]  able to go to a gym and have the hot tub in the women's area i've been in many gyms that
[1:38:21.760 --> 1:38:24.840]  have especially the big ones have a hot tub in the steam room in the men's area they have
[1:38:24.840 --> 1:38:31.680]  one in the women's area and can you just imagine that you're in there and boom there is a pervert
[1:38:31.680 --> 1:38:36.200]  dude in there and i and i got to where i stopped using the gyms back when i was in really good
[1:38:36.200 --> 1:38:40.400]  shape because you know on a routine basis there'd be some dude just begging to have sex with
[1:38:40.400 --> 1:38:44.040]  you in the hot tub i'm like come on dude i'm not into that leave me alone well imagine
[1:38:44.040 --> 1:38:49.680]  these poor women have to get solicited by a guy with a trouser snake with them in the
[1:38:49.680 --> 1:39:01.640]  hot tub hydrofluorolytic acid is an electrified form of fluoride now microscopic amounts of
[1:39:01.640 --> 1:39:06.880]  calcium fluoride are needed for our bodies and are good for us but tiny amounts a lot
[1:39:06.880 --> 1:39:11.560]  of it's deadly poison but hydrofluorolytic acid is electrified it's one of the most
[1:39:11.560 --> 1:39:17.280]  deadly toxic poisons on the planet and since the late 1940s little gift from the new world
[1:39:17.280 --> 1:39:22.600]  order they've been putting it in our water to annihilate our DNA twist our chromosomes
[1:39:22.600 --> 1:39:29.840]  and lower our IQs and fertility well there has to be a good halogen and it's called iodine
[1:39:29.840 --> 1:39:35.120]  and we happen to have the highest quality formulas of iodine available anywhere we have
[1:39:35.120 --> 1:39:40.000]  to have a DEA license and our manufacturers just to put out the deep earth crystals that
[1:39:40.000 --> 1:39:44.920]  are in x2 and x3 both of which are discounted through the port of july the double patriot
[1:39:44.920 --> 1:39:50.640]  points and free shipping 50% off for x2 60% off for x3 and x3 selling out take advantage
[1:39:50.640 --> 1:39:58.520]  of it now the globalists are having their revolution but free humanity has to have
[1:39:58.520 --> 1:40:06.720]  its revolution we have to first recognize this anti-human takeovers trying to enslave
[1:40:06.720 --> 1:40:12.360]  the entire biological processes of humans and turn us into these artificial corporate
[1:40:12.360 --> 1:40:22.440]  controlled slaves worse than slaves just property from cradle to grave of the system
[1:40:22.440 --> 1:40:28.560]  rendered down to be servile minions of the system in a ritual of dominance and safety
[1:40:28.560 --> 1:40:34.080]  and control we have to recognize the great reset post-industrial world which realizes
[1:40:34.080 --> 1:40:38.280]  the nightmare dystopia and we have to promote liberty and freedom that is the opposite of
[1:40:38.280 --> 1:40:44.080]  their dystopia it's that choice it's that realization that's going to change the world
[1:40:44.080 --> 1:40:49.600]  and it's the only choice we've got freedom or slavery go to evil it is a spiritual battle
[1:40:49.600 --> 1:40:56.200]  and info wars at the tip of the spear fighting it well all the big box stores are making
[1:40:56.200 --> 1:41:03.360]  record profits so is amazon because they designed the global shutdown to destroy small and medium
[1:41:03.360 --> 1:41:12.240]  sized businesses and it is leaking havoc in the supply chain thousands of small companies
[1:41:12.240 --> 1:41:18.560]  have completely shut down and others are struggling to stay open because they can't get raw materials
[1:41:18.560 --> 1:41:22.200]  whether it's for food whether it's for medicine whether it's for supplements whether it's
[1:41:22.200 --> 1:41:28.000]  for textiles whatever the product is you see it in the news it is record level supply chain
[1:41:28.000 --> 1:41:32.000]  breakdowns because the globalists shut down the world of comics for more than a year now
[1:41:32.000 --> 1:41:36.160]  they're trying to bring the shutdown back again in fact areas like india and areas of
[1:41:36.160 --> 1:41:42.920]  africa the shutdown is ongoing it's killing those people in massive numbers so info wars
[1:41:42.920 --> 1:41:46.360]  doesn't have a lot of our best selling products anymore for six seven eight months because
[1:41:46.360 --> 1:41:51.320]  of this so to make up the shortfall please buy t-shirts books films things like that
[1:41:51.320 --> 1:41:55.440]  at info wars.com and please try to keep us on the air when the first world collapses
[1:41:55.440 --> 1:42:00.720]  the third world dies and we're seeing tens of millions of extra people in the third world
[1:42:00.720 --> 1:42:05.120]  now starve to death thanks to claus Schwab and bill gates the great reset they need to
[1:42:05.120 --> 1:42:08.400]  go to prison for what they've done and here in the u.s. we've seen more than half the
[1:42:08.400 --> 1:42:13.160]  small businesses go out of business and every major supplement supplier we've got is either
[1:42:13.160 --> 1:42:19.280]  closing or operating at minimum capacity because they can't even get product in for the raw
[1:42:19.280 --> 1:42:24.400]  material ladies and gentlemen that's why it's more important to ever to realize that the
[1:42:24.400 --> 1:42:29.320]  products we do have available at info wars.com are the product sales that are keeping us on
[1:42:29.320 --> 1:42:34.240]  air and i know you're always used to big sales and so you don't buy the products until they're
[1:42:34.240 --> 1:42:38.200]  on sale so it's a catch for me to we have less of the product and we're still selling

[1:43:20.920 --> 1:43:25.200]  the devil went down to georgia he was looking for a soul to steal he was in a bind because
[1:43:25.200 --> 1:43:29.200]  he was way behind and he was willing to make a deal when he came across this young man
[1:43:29.200 --> 1:43:33.160]  selling on a fiddle and playing in hot and the devil jumped up on a hickory stump and
[1:43:33.160 --> 1:43:34.160]  said boy let me tell you what.
[1:43:34.160 --> 1:43:36.960]  All right if you just joined us i'm going to get the number out in a moment we're up
[1:43:36.960 --> 1:43:44.320]  the phones up next hour and we're here live on the alex jones show disgusting why are
[1:43:44.320 --> 1:43:49.840]  all the big corporations why is all the media why are the universities bullying everyone
[1:43:49.840 --> 1:43:56.720]  and threatening miss america if they don't nominate a man that says they're a woman and
[1:43:56.720 --> 1:44:01.720]  the olympics they're saying are going to be all men competing as women and no women will
[1:44:01.720 --> 1:44:07.680]  win any of the sports except maybe target shooting as women are as good or better if
[1:44:07.680 --> 1:44:15.480]  trained right with guns i mean women are going to lose everywhere and that's men invading
[1:44:15.480 --> 1:44:20.520]  the sport you know answer i'm strong took testosterone and they say it took too much
[1:44:20.520 --> 1:44:25.440]  of it took some other things because he lost one testicle with cancer and he was defrocked
[1:44:25.440 --> 1:44:31.800]  and lost all of his true difference titles and the rest of them lost his big mansion
[1:44:31.800 --> 1:44:42.400]  everything else and they say he's the villain of all villains but it's okay to have men
[1:44:42.400 --> 1:44:53.360]  go into the private women's area of a spa in their bathrooms and get naked with a beard
[1:44:53.360 --> 1:45:04.840]  with their penis in the hot tub in front of a six year old girl and the police say that's
[1:45:04.840 --> 1:45:12.120]  fine that's like saying a motorcycle rider identifies as a cyclist and it's going to
[1:45:12.120 --> 1:45:17.160]  go introduce themselves into the cycling community and look at the they've done all the spoofs
[1:45:17.160 --> 1:45:26.040]  and like oh motorcyclist identifies as a cyclist wins world championship hell give them a you
[1:45:26.040 --> 1:45:30.760]  know 300 horsepower motorcycle that goes 300 miles an hour and they'll finish the tour
[1:45:30.760 --> 1:45:41.200]  to France days before everybody else and they identify as a cyclist hell how about a passenger
[1:45:41.200 --> 1:45:55.760]  jet identifies as a car how about a passenger jet identifies as a car or a fighter jet it's
[1:45:55.760 --> 1:46:05.840]  doing you know Mach 1.5 Mach 2 and it can just fly over the drag racing place in Daytona
[1:46:05.840 --> 1:46:13.440]  and the drag racer is going 300 miles an hour and the jets going 1500 miles an hour as long
[1:46:13.440 --> 1:46:20.080]  as the jet identifies as a drag racer it can win how about a helicopter that goes 250 miles
[1:46:20.080 --> 1:46:25.800]  an hour how about introduces itself and says it's a it's a jogger it's a runner and then
[1:46:25.800 --> 1:46:30.160]  the helicopter wins and of course all that's asinine but that's what this is supposed to
[1:46:30.160 --> 1:46:35.760]  do is to get you to accept anything so you'll accept gene therapies and transhumanism and
[1:46:35.760 --> 1:46:41.240]  experimental injections and all the death that comes with it what does the new Logitech
[1:46:41.240 --> 1:46:49.120]  computer ad say defy logic get rid of logic don't listen to logic suspend your own logic

[1:47:50.160 --> 1:47:55.840]  so if any of the women get caught using testosterone they get kicked out but because this person

[1:53:58.560 --> 1:54:08.040]  processes of humans and turn us into these artificial corporate controlled slaves worse
[1:54:08.040 --> 1:54:15.360]  than slaves just property from cradle to grave of the system rendered down to be servile
[1:54:15.360 --> 1:54:21.640]  minions of the system and a ritual of dominance and satanic control we have to recognize the
[1:54:21.640 --> 1:54:26.080]  great reset post-industrial world which realizes a nightmare dystopia and we have to promote
[1:54:26.080 --> 1:54:31.720]  liberty and freedom that is the opposite of their dystopia it's that choice it's that
[1:54:31.720 --> 1:54:36.840]  realization that's going to change the world and it's the only choice we've got freedom

[1:54:47.160 --> 1:54:52.360]  Hey Alex welcome would like to say first off thanks for being the voice of reason and amongst
[1:54:52.360 --> 1:54:56.400]  all this stupidity wanted to warn people I've been trying to get a hold of you for a year
[1:54:56.400 --> 1:55:03.160]  okay I'm a double amputee and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away
[1:55:03.160 --> 1:55:08.920]  a living defense saved my life they had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed
[1:55:08.920 --> 1:55:14.760]  me living defense brought me back I wanted to just quote from the Bible Jesus is saying
[1:55:14.760 --> 1:55:20.920]  as to where we are right now this is Matthew 24 verse 9 then they shall deliver you up
[1:55:20.920 --> 1:55:27.640]  to be afflicted and shall kill you and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name
[1:55:27.640 --> 1:55:33.720]  say and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another
[1:55:33.720 --> 1:55:38.160]  that's right where we're at brother and that's because God's name is on the founding of this
[1:55:38.160 --> 1:55:42.440]  country no matter what they say and that's why the enemy hates it because God created
[1:55:42.440 --> 1:55:43.440]  this country
[1:55:43.440 --> 1:55:59.720]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show

[1:56:38.240 --> 1:56:41.920]  order's end game the final moves of the new world order
[1:56:41.920 --> 1:56:50.960]  one communist on the faculty of one university is one communist too many even if there are
[1:56:50.960 --> 1:56:58.240]  only one communist in the state department that could still be one communist too many
[1:56:58.240 --> 1:57:04.000]  Dr. Henry Kissinger sits in on the talks that are animated constructive and frank at the
[1:57:04.000 --> 1:57:09.360]  summit face-to-face two leaders who directed destiny of one out of three persons on the
[1:57:09.360 --> 1:57:16.240]  earth the gate to friendly contacts as Joe and lie has finally been opened former CIA
[1:57:16.240 --> 1:57:21.280]  director John Brennan also revealing he was once a communist sympathizer during the cold
[1:57:21.280 --> 1:57:28.040]  war for crying out loud are you kidding me I saw an article in 2003 where Comey was bragging
[1:57:28.040 --> 1:57:33.440]  that yeah I was a communist until I became whatever I am now I've never heard that Comey
[1:57:33.440 --> 1:57:40.720]  the communist how about who knew that is amazing folks we've got communists and globalists
[1:57:40.720 --> 1:57:45.840]  breathing down the neck of the United States China threatened war against us in a huge speech today
[1:57:45.840 --> 1:57:48.000]  I誰妄想這樣幹
[1:57:49.760 --> 1:57:54.640] 必將在十四多億中國人民用蟹肉
[1:57:55.920 --> 1:58:01.200] 注成的鋼鐵長城面前碰的頭破血流
[1:58:01.760 --> 1:58:09.280]  and weapons technology has developed in such a manner not only with the destructiveness of
[1:58:09.280 --> 1:58:17.520]  weapons but with the artificial intelligence to unleash the full capabilities of either side
[1:58:18.480 --> 1:58:27.120]  on the other let's say it's some basis for some cooperative action the world will slide into
[1:58:28.240 --> 1:58:38.400]  a catastrophe comparable to world war one with the technology that it's even more difficult
[1:58:38.400 --> 1:58:45.840]  to control the analogy of the flame of liberty you know the the people have the people going to
[1:58:45.840 --> 1:58:49.840]  it or I don't know whatever the numbers are the communists going towards the light of liberty
[1:58:49.840 --> 1:58:53.520]  the torture they're going to extinguish exactly they want to put it out we're about to be under
[1:58:53.520 --> 1:59:00.000]  total communist takeover reeducation that's their plan they don't want to just take the US over
[1:59:00.000 --> 1:59:05.760]  they want to butcher it chop it in pieces for maybe 80 90 years like the Russians I mean they
[1:59:05.760 --> 1:59:13.120]  want to break our spirit out of these troubled times our fifth objective a new world order
[1:59:13.840 --> 1:59:20.480]  can emerge a new world order a world for the rule of law not the law of the jungle
[1:59:21.120 --> 1:59:27.280]  governs the conductive nations a world in which there is the very real prospect of a new world
[1:59:27.280 --> 1:59:33.040]  order defense secretary dick cheney has approved a revised draft of a policy document on the new
[1:59:33.040 --> 1:59:39.600]  world order this would be the time because you really need to bring china into the creation of a
[1:59:39.600 --> 1:59:47.120]  new world order you know I don't like to think in terms of opportunities at this point I would
[1:59:47.120 --> 1:59:52.080]  put it at least in my area more in terms of the biggest challenge that we faced and we were in the
[1:59:52.080 --> 1:59:59.760]  midst of one of the historic global transformations that is going to eventually lead to a new world
[1:59:59.760 --> 2:00:10.560]  order the affirmative task we have now is is to actually create a new world order this information
[2:00:10.560 --> 2:00:15.760]  this intelligence is tough to swallow because they they haven't really seen it play out like we have
[2:00:15.760 --> 2:00:21.920]  an info wars for the last decade the juxtaposition of this with say hunter biden is extraordinary
[2:00:21.920 --> 2:00:28.480]  hunter biden still has a 200 million dollar stake in a investment fund in which his partner
[2:00:28.480 --> 2:00:33.840]  is the chinese communist party we need to really understand this could be the last year live forth
[2:00:33.840 --> 2:00:39.440]  ever in this country in fact you could say last year was we really are a congregation if we're not
[2:00:39.440 --> 2:00:44.480]  honest with ourselves about how much trouble we're in we have no hope so i'm just asking
[2:00:44.480 --> 2:00:49.120]  listeners to realize that this is the moment of truth these people realize this is the globalist
[2:00:49.120 --> 2:00:55.360]  takeover at every level and reject it well all the big box stores are making record profits
[2:00:55.360 --> 2:01:01.840]  so is amazon because they designed the global shutdown to destroy small and medium-sized
[2:01:01.840 --> 2:01:09.760]  businesses and it is wreaking havoc in the supply chain thousands thousands of small
[2:01:09.760 --> 2:01:15.840]  companies have completely shut down and others are struggling to stay open because they can't get
[2:01:15.840 --> 2:01:19.840]  raw materials whether it's for food whether it's for medicine whether it's for supplements
[2:01:19.840 --> 2:01:25.440]  whether it's for textiles whatever the product is you see it in the news it is record level
[2:01:25.440 --> 2:01:29.840]  supply chain breakdown because the globalist shut down the world economy for more than a year
[2:01:29.840 --> 2:01:34.880]  and now they're trying to bring the shutdown back again in fact areas like india and areas of africa
[2:01:34.880 --> 2:01:41.360]  the shutdown is ongoing it's killing those people in massive numbers so info wars doesn't have a
[2:01:41.360 --> 2:01:45.760]  lot of our best selling products anymore for six seven eight months because of this so to make up
[2:01:45.760 --> 2:01:50.880]  this work ball please buy t-shirts books films things like that at info wars.com and please try to
[2:01:50.880 --> 2:02:03.280]  keep us on the air big brother mainstream media government cover-up you want to stop tearing
[2:02:03.280 --> 2:02:09.680]  well so does he live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones
[2:02:09.680 --> 2:02:15.200]  i don't mind coming here jen and sake do not mix
[2:02:17.200 --> 2:02:25.120]  that's upon who has the name of liquor or alcohol in both first and last names
[2:02:26.880 --> 2:02:30.640]  it'd be like if your name was willy johnson or something it's kind of cute it's kind of funny
[2:02:30.640 --> 2:02:36.240]  in that case but i mean with her jen sake and i think her parents were engaged in a joke but she
[2:02:36.240 --> 2:02:41.760]  doesn't look too she doesn't look too happy about that in the world she lives and she's got a tough
[2:02:41.760 --> 2:02:46.400]  job gaslighting the american people people the world so i was just about to come to this segment
[2:02:46.400 --> 2:02:52.720]  and open the phones up and go to your calls and talk about communism and how the globalist big
[2:02:52.720 --> 2:03:01.440]  megabanks are using communism as their operating system and that's really how it's always been
[2:03:01.440 --> 2:03:05.120]  i remember like 15 years ago the head of the communist party in china right before he stepped
[2:03:05.120 --> 2:03:14.320]  down and gg pink took over said china is the ultimate example of capitalism and communism emerging
[2:03:15.200 --> 2:03:20.720]  and that our communist experiment is the ultimate form of capitalism people said that doesn't make
[2:03:20.720 --> 2:03:27.120]  sense but then remember obama before he left office five years ago did a big tour in latin america
[2:03:27.680 --> 2:03:33.680]  in chile and a bunch of places he gave the same speech to graduate students wanted to law school
[2:03:33.680 --> 2:03:37.680]  he ought to pull this up because he said it in english we played it many times years ago
[2:03:37.680 --> 2:03:43.440]  he said oh listen we need a communist country like china that works with multinational corporations
[2:03:43.440 --> 2:03:48.080]  that are capitalist and that's the system we're building where one country's communist and then
[2:03:48.080 --> 2:03:52.480]  one country's capitalist and then they work together which means your slaves in one country
[2:03:52.480 --> 2:03:58.480]  we exploit you out over here now he went to africa the same year he didn't give him that speech
[2:03:58.480 --> 2:04:04.320]  he said you can't have cars or air conditioning or the earth's gonna burn up even though they've
[2:04:04.320 --> 2:04:08.960]  got totally clean cars and air conditioning now and it's been proven the earth was starved for carbon
[2:04:08.960 --> 2:04:12.880]  until the industrial revolution and then the temperature did go up about a few degrees
[2:04:12.880 --> 2:04:18.320]  a new ice age was due and now it's already uh trending towards flattening out now but
[2:04:18.320 --> 2:04:23.040]  it doesn't matter carbon dioxide to trace gas like oxygen they're both very very low and have
[2:04:23.040 --> 2:04:28.880]  been much higher in the planet's history that's why plants and animals used to be bigger because
[2:04:28.880 --> 2:04:36.160]  there's more oxygen more carbon dioxide by the way that's mainline science they don't want you to know
[2:04:36.160 --> 2:04:43.840]  that and so just while i was about to come on and play one of the health minister spoke persons in
[2:04:43.840 --> 2:04:49.600]  the uk who's an avowed communist when comey's a communist he admits he knows you're the communist
[2:04:49.600 --> 2:04:56.640]  party james comey uh brennan member of the communist party because you didn't get into
[2:04:56.640 --> 2:05:00.080]  government in the 60s and 70s and things if you weren't a communist by that point
[2:05:02.240 --> 2:05:07.360]  i know a lot of people folks who had family that had done good job at the state department of their
[2:05:07.360 --> 2:05:12.400]  areas but because they were conservative by the time they were in the 80s and 90s and they tried
[2:05:12.400 --> 2:05:17.920]  to get jobs even though they had straight a's didn't matter was from yale harvard vanderbilt
[2:05:17.920 --> 2:05:23.920]  where it was they couldn't get a job because well you come from conservatives we're done with you
[2:05:25.120 --> 2:05:31.040]  the folks that actually built the country we want john brennan we want james comey we want people
[2:05:31.040 --> 2:05:36.080]  that say they're communist john bounded an excellent report on it we just aired some stations just
[2:05:36.080 --> 2:05:40.320]  joined us everybody should go check it out it's a band-aid video in fact i'm gonna ask it to
[2:05:40.320 --> 2:05:45.680]  post it in the live show feed today we always have a headline for the show every day and we
[2:05:45.680 --> 2:05:48.880]  can put that headline up i want to read that to folks here in a moment but uh
[2:05:51.040 --> 2:05:56.400]  the final moves of the new world order john bound four minute report 164
[2:05:58.400 --> 2:06:06.480]  thousand views and it absolutely needs to get out the final moves of the new world order
[2:06:07.360 --> 2:06:12.720]  and again if you go to the front page of info wars dot com and you see today's live show feed
[2:06:12.720 --> 2:06:18.160]  i'm gonna have it added into that every day we give the live show a particular name of the broadcast
[2:06:19.760 --> 2:06:23.920]  and again it's very easy i'll just go there myself and i'll pull it up for you
[2:06:25.040 --> 2:06:32.400]  tuesday live tucker carlson is not the new alex jones the world is simply waking up and seeing
[2:06:32.400 --> 2:06:37.760]  the same thing as jones there's been a huge battle on twitter instagram everywhere where
[2:06:37.760 --> 2:06:42.960]  people are defending me people are attacking me and we just keep winning the debates because what we
[2:06:42.960 --> 2:06:49.200]  actually say is one thing versus what the corporate media says we're saying but let me get back to
[2:06:49.200 --> 2:06:54.000]  where i was i'm digressing i was about to play this british health minister
[2:06:56.880 --> 2:07:00.240]  when they asked well do you like permanent lockdowns and permanent masks because you're an
[2:07:00.240 --> 2:07:06.160]  authoritarian communist she says how dare you question the science i am a scientist my party
[2:07:06.160 --> 2:07:11.680]  affiliation means nothing when that's a sick joke the whole e you got made up with former
[2:07:11.680 --> 2:07:16.880]  communist bureaucrats this is a communist authoritarian takeover by mega banks that are
[2:07:16.880 --> 2:07:22.960]  tax exempt remember what charlie monger business partners with bill gates and warren bubba bill
[2:07:22.960 --> 2:07:28.400]  gates is personal lawyer another eugenesis said he said i love communist china i want to be like them
[2:07:28.400 --> 2:07:34.880]  i love communist china i want to be a dictator like ggp these are real quotes
[2:07:37.840 --> 2:07:43.280]  oh you would blame again in fact we'll take some calls next segment eight seven seven seven eight
[2:07:43.280 --> 2:07:48.240]  nine two five three nine eight seven seven seven eight nine alex but at the bottom of the hour
[2:07:48.240 --> 2:07:53.440]  i'll play charlie monger for you again and then i'll play trudeau for you because we're not making
[2:07:53.440 --> 2:07:56.880]  any of this up you know that's the difference when brian stelter calls me a white supremacist
[2:07:56.880 --> 2:08:01.040]  he doesn't show where i say white should be supreme over everybody so he doesn't have it
[2:08:01.680 --> 2:08:06.800]  but when i tell you that fiona hill writes articles that we need world government i show you where
[2:08:06.800 --> 2:08:12.800]  she wrote it see how that works you read a mainstream news article where are the links
[2:08:12.800 --> 2:08:17.760]  showing when i said they don't show them because it's not true
[2:08:17.760 --> 2:08:24.720]  so here is the latest
[2:08:26.880 --> 2:08:30.400]  sake but i told you says the contact tracers are coming to your house
[2:08:31.120 --> 2:08:35.520]  to make sure you've had your inoculations in the future oh you had a sniffle oh you look sick
[2:08:35.520 --> 2:08:39.920]  we're taking you to a facility already have been australia have been europe have been the
[2:08:39.920 --> 2:08:45.120]  uk have been canada sustain you and run program and the end goal the un says is coming in your house
[2:08:45.120 --> 2:08:49.840]  and taking you out of it and it's run by the clinton global initiative who's gotten billions
[2:08:49.840 --> 2:08:55.440]  of dollars to running so it's private corporate groups paid for to come harass you to take their
[2:08:55.440 --> 2:09:01.920]  poison shot here it is healthcare settings and responds to hot spots the president will outline
[2:09:01.920 --> 2:09:08.640]  five areas his team is focused on to get more americans vaccinated one uh targeted community
[2:09:08.640 --> 2:09:13.200]  by community door-to-door outreach to get remaining americans vaccinated by ensuring they have the
[2:09:13.200 --> 2:09:18.880]  information they need on how both safe and accessible the vaccine is to a renewed emphasis
[2:09:18.880 --> 2:09:23.040]  on getting the vaccines to more primary care doctors and physicians something that we've seen
[2:09:24.720 --> 2:09:28.640]  there you go so just rolling out the feds are coming to check on your health but it's all about
[2:09:28.640 --> 2:09:33.680]  being able to arrest whoever they want with a fake PCR test if even that or if you're even in contact
[2:09:33.680 --> 2:09:38.000]  with someone they think had a variant which is a cold virus it's a perfect way to make us all
[2:09:38.000 --> 2:09:43.200]  suspects all criminals here's susan mitchie expressing outrage when asked if her 40-year
[2:09:43.200 --> 2:09:49.360]  membership of the communist party might inform her policies towards authoritarianism she's an
[2:09:49.360 --> 2:09:53.920]  advisor to the government and a communist who wants a permanent lockdown permanent masker she is
[2:09:56.000 --> 2:10:00.160]  we shouldn't lift restrictions at all on the 19 we should carry on exactly as we are
[2:10:00.160 --> 2:10:05.600]  am i right is that what you are suggesting well lifting restrictions will increase transmission
[2:10:05.600 --> 2:10:12.480]  and with all the problems that i've just talked about it doesn't seem to me the best time to
[2:10:12.480 --> 2:10:19.440]  do that if you remember a few weeks ago we actually postponed lifting restrictions because
[2:10:19.440 --> 2:10:24.880]  the situation was so serious but the situation is even more serious now than it was then there's
[2:10:24.880 --> 2:10:28.960]  a point i really have to put to you and you'll be aware of this because there's been a lot of
[2:10:28.960 --> 2:10:34.480]  commentary about this in the british media about you and it's to deal with your politics and you
[2:10:34.480 --> 2:10:38.880]  know i'm going to ask you you've been a member of the communist party for about 40 years now you're
[2:10:38.880 --> 2:10:44.240]  still a member and we know that that communism is basically status we look at communist countries
[2:10:44.240 --> 2:10:48.240]  around the world and we see that they are tremendously top-down dominant and controlled
[2:10:48.240 --> 2:10:52.880]  societies that they that they rule over and i just wonder i'm putting this question on behalf of
[2:10:52.880 --> 2:10:58.400]  those who wonder about your politics if your politics actually informs your sense of control
[2:10:58.400 --> 2:11:03.600]  it's not just it's not just the medical argument but you have a kind of a political bent to want
[2:11:03.600 --> 2:11:12.320]  the state to tell people what to do i've come on your program as a scientist as do all people who
[2:11:12.320 --> 2:11:18.240]  come on to your program as scientists they come on to talk about the evidence relevant theories
[2:11:18.240 --> 2:11:25.840]  how they approach scientific disciplines and you don't ask other scientists about politics so
[2:11:25.840 --> 2:11:33.120]  i'm very happy to speak about science which is what my job is and and to live with it to that
[2:11:33.120 --> 2:11:38.400]  so you're that's enough it goes on it's on info wars dot com she's totally political it's all
[2:11:38.400 --> 2:11:42.640]  lies the numbers are all lies they want total control that they work for the big mega banks
[2:11:42.640 --> 2:11:46.320]  to shut down all their competition to make you non-essential and she should live in her permanent
[2:11:46.320 --> 2:11:56.640]  martial law she's a dirty freaking commie we're right back granny do right granny do right thanks
[2:11:56.640 --> 2:12:01.600]  for holding her on the air go ahead challenge first of all let me say i love your products i am a
[2:12:01.600 --> 2:12:07.120]  granny and um for all the seniors citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun
[2:12:07.120 --> 2:12:13.200]  like me i was loaded up with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called but since taking your
[2:12:13.200 --> 2:12:19.600]  x2 for the last couple of years my skin is just really gorgeous actually people think i'm 55 years
[2:12:19.600 --> 2:12:25.920]  old and i was already taking your other supplements but i thought you know well maybe that's what i
[2:12:25.920 --> 2:12:30.720]  need to do because i just thought it was a hopeless situation but when i started taking it i mean
[2:12:30.720 --> 2:12:36.720]  doesn't happen immediately but you know over a period of time i started noticing okay you know
[2:12:36.720 --> 2:12:42.640]  this is a ticket this is working this is wonderful you know i don't i don't have to put on derma
[2:12:42.640 --> 2:12:48.720]  blend anymore you know so anyway it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin

[2:16:18.560 --> 2:16:24.480]  we're bad because we're white it's all monger and then funding the whole thing but here first
[2:16:24.480 --> 2:16:30.240]  is justin trudeau in case you think i made it up earlier saying the prime minister of canada
[2:16:30.240 --> 2:16:34.960]  he likes dictatorship he admires dictatorship and charlie monger says the same thing here it is
[2:16:34.960 --> 2:16:46.480]  all of of admiration i actually have for china because their basic dictatorship is allowing
[2:16:46.480 --> 2:16:51.760]  them to actually turn their economy around on a dime and say we need to go green as fast as we need
[2:16:51.760 --> 2:16:57.040]  to start you know investing in solar i'll be there is a flexibility that i know steven harper must
[2:16:57.040 --> 2:17:04.480]  dream about of having a dictatorship that he could do everything he wanted how you just do whatever you
[2:17:04.480 --> 2:17:09.760]  want oh take a rest whoever you want you lock up whoever you want oh like you've done with the virus
[2:17:09.760 --> 2:17:14.640]  training us to all live under a communist system and so here's charlie monger one more time he said
[2:17:14.640 --> 2:17:19.680]  this last week last friday just oh i wish we had what they could do in their economy where they just
[2:17:19.680 --> 2:17:25.600]  arrest people for not being a monopoly here it is he said communist china is doing all the things
[2:17:25.600 --> 2:17:31.200]  that we should be doing right now and i can't help but think of what they're using me you know what
[2:17:31.200 --> 2:17:36.400]  about what they've done to jack ma he's kind of disappeared as well yes but jack was one of those
[2:17:36.400 --> 2:17:44.720]  flanners so they just cut his they said the hell with you he basically gave speech when he said to
[2:17:44.720 --> 2:17:51.360]  a one party state well you guys are a bunch of jerks don't know what you're doing and i know what
[2:17:51.360 --> 2:17:56.320]  i'm doing i'm going to do it better and he was going to wade into banking and no rules and just
[2:17:56.320 --> 2:18:02.400]  do whatever he pleased he also got a lot of communist did the right thing they just called
[2:18:02.400 --> 2:18:10.400]  in jack bond say you aren't going to do it sonny and and i wish we had a i don't want all of the
[2:18:10.400 --> 2:18:15.760]  chinese system but i certainly would like to have the financial part of it in my own country
[2:18:15.760 --> 2:18:19.360]  although ant financial was bringing banking to a huge unbanked population
[2:18:19.360 --> 2:18:24.560]  but yeah he was gonna actually let poor people have access to banking and not a social credit score
[2:18:24.560 --> 2:18:29.840]  where old men like that can just turn you off and like what you say oh jack ma we send him to a
[2:18:29.840 --> 2:18:37.040]  forced labor camp hey sonny i work tens of millions of dollars i work with canning i'm gonna do that
[2:18:37.040 --> 2:18:44.960]  well i'm building this lawyer meanwhile what do the big corporations do teach us to hate ourselves
[2:18:44.960 --> 2:18:50.640]  in four wars dot com independence day marvel comics makes captain america say america dream is a lie
[2:18:52.240 --> 2:18:58.320]  captain america said america is actually bad it's a lie and it's racist and he's the new black
[2:18:58.320 --> 2:19:08.080]  captain america i'm loyal to nothing says captain america white picket fences ooh families doesn't
[2:19:08.080 --> 2:19:13.680]  get along nicely with reality other cultures immigrants the poor oh wealth the middle class
[2:19:13.680 --> 2:19:24.560]  it's all bad captain america says so see how it works let's go to michael in california then uh
[2:19:24.560 --> 2:19:31.920]  shelby on the same subject charlie monger what do you think of that hey alex thank you for taking my
[2:19:31.920 --> 2:19:41.200]  call yes sir uh so charlie monger uh i was told allegedly i don't i can't confirm this but
[2:19:41.200 --> 2:19:48.240]  apparently he used his his money to buy the current g.o.p. chair in the state of california
[2:19:48.800 --> 2:19:56.640]  her name is jessica melan paterson um this is the first year the convention was held virtually
[2:19:56.640 --> 2:20:03.520]  in the state of california as far as i understand because of covet so jessica was reelected as g.o.p
[2:20:03.520 --> 2:20:10.560]  chair in the state conveniently uh because it was a virtual convention oh course i mean charlie
[2:20:10.560 --> 2:20:17.440]  monger admits he wants to be a he wants a dictator ship he admits he's a bad guy right so i just i
[2:20:17.440 --> 2:20:23.360]  just need all californians and all conservatives throughout the country to understand that i mean
[2:20:23.360 --> 2:20:28.480]  we have we probably have the biggest g.o.p. in the in the country in the state of california um
[2:20:28.480 --> 2:20:35.200]  and our chair is bought and paid for by charlie monger allegedly um and and she just immediately
[2:20:35.200 --> 2:20:40.640]  shut down any kind of dissent anyone trying to tell you say that monger said in the rest of the
[2:20:40.640 --> 2:20:45.280]  interview america is bad we should never reopen china did such a great job i mean because he's
[2:20:45.280 --> 2:20:53.280]  invested in china yeah his job is bring america down yeah so i just want to thank info wars uh
[2:20:53.280 --> 2:20:59.920]  for your show is the reason why i got involved in politics um and uh and i just want to encourage
[2:20:59.920 --> 2:21:04.480]  anyone else out there if you want to make a difference uh contact your local g.o.p. chair
[2:21:04.480 --> 2:21:10.400]  to get involved locally and that's how we can actually make a difference because uh but the
[2:21:10.400 --> 2:21:15.040]  current g.o.p. they're sending out in the state of california they're sending out letters uh in
[2:21:15.040 --> 2:21:20.960]  support of kevin falconer for governor and we need to not put our support behind this guy well
[2:21:20.960 --> 2:21:25.120]  that's why we're losing the country is grassroots folks are not taking over the machinery of the
[2:21:25.120 --> 2:21:29.600]  republican party and the communist are instead great points all right let's talk to shelbing
[2:21:29.600 --> 2:21:37.760]  in iowa on the same subject warren buffett berkshire hathaway go ahead hey alex um so i was a
[2:21:37.760 --> 2:21:42.800]  supervisor for a berkshire hathaway home state company up until about uh a couple weeks ago
[2:21:43.360 --> 2:21:49.280]  and back in march i went to our hr saying you know i don't agree with a lot of things
[2:21:49.280 --> 2:21:55.680]  are going on behind closed doors and i'm fairly certain that my management is reading my text
[2:21:55.680 --> 2:22:02.960]  messages on my personal phone and nothing really came of it and then um about a week later they
[2:22:02.960 --> 2:22:12.560]  gave me a first and final warning over an email that was sent in 2018 and um so then i just laid
[2:22:12.560 --> 2:22:19.040]  low for a while you know and minded my p's and cues about three months later the beginning of june
[2:22:19.040 --> 2:22:26.480]  they came out with a mandatory compliance training video and in the video they had berkshire

[2:24:50.880 --> 2:24:53.560]  It's crazy to get to this point. It's very bittersweet
[2:24:54.360 --> 2:24:58.520]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would and now we have a lot of credibility
[2:24:58.520 --> 2:25:01.020]  But I don't care about that. I care about beating the new world order
[2:25:01.320 --> 2:25:03.320]  And it's because we have so much credibility
[2:25:03.320 --> 2:25:08.040]  They can't allow us to stay on air much longer and I don't have time to tell you all the stuff
[2:25:08.040 --> 2:25:10.980]  They're doing to us for a lot of reasons. I can't tell you what's going on
[2:25:10.980 --> 2:25:13.800]  But let's just say this we're gonna see this through the end
[2:25:13.880 --> 2:25:20.480]  We're gonna stay on air as long as we can so please pray for us and please buy the products and then for store.com

[2:25:31.680 --> 2:25:36.200]  When the whole world's waking up and looking for truth, that's why the globalists are censoring
[2:25:36.200 --> 2:25:39.360]  They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air
[2:25:39.520 --> 2:25:42.520]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word
[2:25:42.960 --> 2:25:49.280]  Download everything we've done you can find and save it because who knows how long we're gonna be on the air and the enemy is trying to destroy
[2:25:49.280 --> 2:25:50.960]  Everything we ever said
[2:25:50.960 --> 2:25:54.120]  Well, all the big box stores are making record profits
[2:25:54.120 --> 2:26:01.280]  So is Amazon because they designed the global shutdown to destroy small and medium-sized businesses
[2:26:01.280 --> 2:26:05.560]  And it is leaking havoc in the supply chain
[2:26:06.560 --> 2:26:11.960]  Thousands of small companies have completely shut down and others are struggling to stay open
[2:26:12.640 --> 2:26:18.560]  Because they can't get raw materials whether it's for food whether it's for medicine whether it's supplements
[2:26:18.560 --> 2:26:21.080]  Whether it's for textiles, whatever the product is
[2:26:21.720 --> 2:26:25.480]  You see it in the news. It is record level supply chain breakdowns
[2:26:25.920 --> 2:26:29.080]  Because the global is shut down the world economy for more than a year now
[2:26:29.080 --> 2:26:35.680]  They're trying to bring the shutdown back again in fact areas like India and areas of Africa the shutdown is ongoing
[2:26:35.680 --> 2:26:38.680]  It's killing those people in massive numbers
[2:26:38.680 --> 2:26:43.800]  So the info wars doesn't have a lot of our best-selling products anymore for six seven eight months because of this
[2:26:43.800 --> 2:26:50.400]  So to make up a shortfall, please buy t-shirts books films things like that at info wars.com and please try to keep us on the air
[2:26:53.600 --> 2:26:56.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:26:56.440 --> 2:27:03.740]  Oh, oh, no
[2:27:06.860 --> 2:27:08.940]  upon a warm summer is evil
[2:27:09.600 --> 2:27:16.820]  From the train bouncing all ways. I met up with the gambling we were both too tired to sleep
[2:27:17.460 --> 2:27:22.140]  So we took turns staring at the window at the darkness
[2:27:22.960 --> 2:27:24.960]  the boredom over took us
[2:27:24.960 --> 2:27:34.120]  And he began to speak, he said, son, I've made a life out of reading people's faces,
[2:27:34.120 --> 2:27:38.640]  knowing what the cards were, by the way they held their eyes.
[2:27:38.640 --> 2:27:41.320]  So if you don't mind me saying.
[2:27:41.320 --> 2:27:44.960]  There's some pretty amazing footage at infowars.com.
[2:27:44.960 --> 2:27:47.960]  But all you should go check out and share.
[2:27:47.960 --> 2:27:54.920]  There's so many of these videos around the country of black people looting targets
[2:27:54.920 --> 2:28:01.360]  looting shoe stores looting Neiman Marcus because they need to these are evil white corporations
[2:28:01.360 --> 2:28:07.120]  even though they're not white out of all the ethnic groups the US per capita average income
[2:28:07.120 --> 2:28:12.040]  the first nine slots are filled by Asians now they're a bunch of old white billionaires
[2:28:12.040 --> 2:28:19.080]  absolutely but white people on average are not even in the top nine groups in this country.
[2:28:19.080 --> 2:28:22.360]  It's not bad to be wealthy it's good to have middle class is good to have well-to-do people
[2:28:22.360 --> 2:28:26.440]  they buy things they have employees they build things that's all the studies show that's
[2:28:26.440 --> 2:28:32.000]  a good thing but despite vehement support for black lives matter Neiman Marcus looted in
[2:28:32.000 --> 2:28:36.040]  San Francisco.
[2:28:36.040 --> 2:28:39.480]  Isn't that just sweet?
[2:28:39.480 --> 2:28:43.440]  And it's pretty powerful footage we're going to be showing that but going back to Shelby
[2:28:43.440 --> 2:28:50.560]  in Iowa so you work for Berkshire Hathaway and you knew they were reading your text messages
[2:28:50.560 --> 2:28:55.440]  on your private phone were they hacking your phone were they scanning your phone and then
[2:28:55.440 --> 2:28:59.840]  you got noticed that they were telling you they could do that huh?
[2:28:59.840 --> 2:29:06.240]  Yeah see the way they when we started working from home they set us up to use the VPN network
[2:29:06.240 --> 2:29:10.680]  and in order to connect they told us the only way to do that was to have this app on your
[2:29:10.680 --> 2:29:17.000]  phone and I knew better but I went along with it and we did it so every day when you log
[2:29:17.000 --> 2:29:23.040]  in to work your phone would be connected to their network all day and I would I started
[2:29:23.040 --> 2:29:27.880]  testing it out right so I would text my boyfriend and then my boss would call me and I'm like
[2:29:27.880 --> 2:29:34.080]  okay so I just started you know testing it out for a while and then this mandatory compliance
[2:29:34.080 --> 2:29:40.280]  training video comes out and I decided to record it and they make it sound like it's
[2:29:40.280 --> 2:29:48.640]  only in case of what we do is work comp insurance actually he owns six work comp insurance companies
[2:29:48.640 --> 2:29:57.560]  and that ties in to play here so what they needed to believe that this was only in case
[2:29:57.560 --> 2:30:04.600]  of if a claim went to court right and they needed to subpoena documents or whatever well
[2:30:04.600 --> 2:30:08.720]  I'm the gears in my head are just turning around like oh this lines up with everything
[2:30:08.720 --> 2:30:15.560]  I've been thinking this whole time and so I record the video and after it's done I text
[2:30:15.560 --> 2:30:20.720]  message that video to all my friends and family I'm like how can this be legal but it's their
[2:30:20.720 --> 2:30:27.000]  lawyers on this video saying that it's legal and so then I decided well I'm going to send
[2:30:27.000 --> 2:30:32.760]  it to Project Veritas so I did I emailed it to Project Veritas and within a week they
[2:30:32.760 --> 2:30:39.800]  came up and said we were firing you for violation of business communication and I said well
[2:30:39.800 --> 2:30:45.040]  what specifically did I do wrong well we don't have to tell you that Nebraska is a no-fault
[2:30:45.040 --> 2:30:48.920]  state we don't have to tell you exactly what oh and they're the good company that's been
[2:30:48.920 --> 2:30:53.160]  caught laundering drug money by the billions and caught getting the biggest banker bailout
[2:30:53.160 --> 2:30:57.920]  in 2008 and it's all about how they're so moral and they're so good and they're not
[2:30:57.920 --> 2:31:04.520]  now Charlie Munger heavily involved with an executive company says he loves China's dictatorship
[2:31:04.520 --> 2:31:11.760]  I mean screw these people these creepy old men exactly I mean and then when I saw that
[2:31:11.760 --> 2:31:19.280]  I was like well another puzzle piece fallen right into place well so do you still have
[2:31:19.280 --> 2:31:23.880]  the video because that's see that's what I said all this lockdown was about making the
[2:31:23.880 --> 2:31:30.640]  courts go online it was about making the businesses go online to chop us off to separate us to
[2:31:30.640 --> 2:31:34.760]  shut down the economy to shut down the economies that live off of people traveling around and
[2:31:34.760 --> 2:31:39.840]  doing things to consolidate power for the globalist is a test for their next big attack but also
[2:31:39.840 --> 2:31:47.120]  so AI could spy on every business and everything we're doing to learn how to control us so
[2:31:47.120 --> 2:31:52.120]  this has all been a big test on how to completely bring us down during the next big bio attack
[2:31:52.120 --> 2:31:56.000]  they're going to release it's going to be far worse in their own words so this is this
[2:31:56.000 --> 2:32:01.400]  AI globalist system sizing us up ladies and gentlemen and people next time they pulled
[2:32:01.400 --> 2:32:06.680]  about viral viral release if you submit they're never going to take the restrictions off it's
[2:32:06.680 --> 2:32:11.120]  meant to cost mass starvation and death they've been preparing this for a long time and God
[2:32:11.120 --> 2:32:16.840]  help us they even say they're dictators they say they want to be dictators they say they
[2:32:16.840 --> 2:32:22.440]  want to arrest you if you challenge their business these are divorced from God divorced
[2:32:22.440 --> 2:32:29.880]  from America totally decadent corrupt people and he stands to profit from this because
[2:32:29.880 --> 2:32:35.240]  when no other insurance is covering all the vaccine side effects they're all going to
[2:32:35.240 --> 2:32:40.000]  go after their work comp because their employers forced them to get the vaccine and so our
[2:32:40.000 --> 2:32:44.560]  work comp industry is just going to boom and skyrocket and then they'll raise premiums
[2:32:44.560 --> 2:32:51.480]  to cover that cost well ma'am veritas ever did anything with it I never heard back or
[2:32:51.480 --> 2:32:56.320]  anything no well they get flooded with stuff you'll listen I want to see this this is very
[2:32:56.320 --> 2:33:00.440]  newsworthy that they're saying we're going to spell on your private phones when we make
[2:33:00.440 --> 2:33:06.160]  you use a VPN and of course that's not unless in terms of services they told you we're spying

[2:33:45.400 --> 2:33:49.920]  years old and I'm going to tell you how it works sunny when we launder all that drug
[2:33:49.920 --> 2:33:58.200]  money all right thank you so much Shelby all right let's go up next here let's talk to
[2:33:58.200 --> 2:34:06.400]  Mark in Texas marker on the air welcome Mr. Jones yes sir was it just me or did you guys
[2:34:06.400 --> 2:34:12.600]  think that Oliver Darcy looked a little satanic in that video I mean the dude never blinked
[2:34:12.600 --> 2:34:18.520]  for like over a minute whole time he's talking about you he looked they just see with hatred
[2:34:18.520 --> 2:34:22.040]  at people that are popular and love freedom I mean can you imagine me and Oliver Darcy
[2:34:22.040 --> 2:34:28.880]  or Brian Stelter I mean these are caricatures of like of like like like servants of a vampire
[2:34:28.880 --> 2:34:34.920]  in a movie or something like little groveling minions I agree okay so check this out second
[2:34:34.920 --> 2:34:42.080]  Thessalonians verse two says the coming of the lawless one will be in accordance with
[2:34:42.080 --> 2:34:47.520]  how Satan works he will use all sorts of displays of power through signs and wonders that serve
[2:34:47.520 --> 2:34:52.920]  the lie and all the ways that wickedness to seize those who are perishing they perish
[2:34:52.920 --> 2:34:58.080]  because they refused to love the truth and so be safe and it's the best part the best
[2:34:58.080 --> 2:35:04.640]  part beautiful for this for this reason God sends them a powerful delusion so that they
[2:35:04.640 --> 2:35:10.400]  will believe the lie and so that all who will be condemned who have not believed the truth
[2:35:10.400 --> 2:35:16.280]  but have delighted and wickedness I think that's setting us up for you know great tribulations
[2:35:16.280 --> 2:35:21.320]  and that was my late uncle's favorite Bible verse because he talks about sending a great
[2:35:21.320 --> 2:35:25.200]  delusion it's even more powerful than the King James version I interrupted you read
[2:35:25.200 --> 2:35:31.720]  that Bible verse again for folks great the coming of the lawless one will be in accordance
[2:35:31.720 --> 2:35:37.760]  with how Satan works he will use all sorts of displays of power through signs and wonders
[2:35:37.760 --> 2:35:44.680]  that serve the lie and all the ways that wickedness to seize those who are perishing they perish
[2:35:44.680 --> 2:35:51.560]  because they refused to love the truth and so be saved for this reason God sends them
[2:35:51.560 --> 2:35:57.360]  a powerful delusion so that they will believe the lie and so that all will be condemned
[2:35:57.360 --> 2:36:03.000]  to have not believed the truth but have delighted and wickedness and when it says gave them
[2:36:03.000 --> 2:36:07.120]  a great delusion or turned them over to great delusion depending on the quote going back
[2:36:07.120 --> 2:36:11.440]  from some of the more ancient texts I've read but yes removes God's discernment what really
[2:36:11.440 --> 2:36:16.240]  happens and so once and so once you don't have God in you you you can be turned over
[2:36:16.240 --> 2:36:21.800]  completely to a giant lie thank you so much Mark okay I'm gonna get everybody before Paul
[2:36:21.800 --> 2:36:28.800]  Watson takes over so anonymous Thomas Nathan Tony Christian Paul we get to every one of

[2:36:53.920 --> 2:37:00.400]  but free humanity has to have its revolution we have to first recognize this anti-human
[2:37:00.400 --> 2:37:07.840]  takeovers trying to enslave the entire biological processes of humans and turn us into these
[2:37:07.840 --> 2:37:17.120]  artificial corporate controlled slaves worse than slaves and just just property from cradle
[2:37:17.120 --> 2:37:23.760]  to grave of the system rendered down to be servile minions of the system and a ritual
[2:37:23.760 --> 2:37:29.480]  of dominance and satanic control we have to recognize the great reset post-industrial
[2:37:29.480 --> 2:37:34.080]  world which realizes a nightmare dystopia and we have to promote liberty and freedom
[2:37:34.080 --> 2:37:39.000]  that is the opposite of their dystopia it's that choice it's that realization that's gonna
[2:37:39.000 --> 2:37:45.280]  change the world and it's the only choice we've got freedom or slavery good or evil
[2:37:45.280 --> 2:37:50.160]  it is a spiritual battle and info wars at the tip of the spear fighting it I don't like
[2:37:50.160 --> 2:37:54.640]  coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast hell I've been on there 27
[2:37:54.640 --> 2:37:58.400]  years and only the last year or so have I said that but let me tell you the new world
[2:37:58.400 --> 2:38:02.640]  orders breathe them down our neck the big globalist publications are coming after us
[2:38:02.640 --> 2:38:06.680]  and they're doing everything they can to shut us down so please pray to keep info wars
[2:38:06.680 --> 2:38:11.560]  on the air and please support the local station you're listening to as well at the same time

[2:38:17.400 --> 2:38:22.680]  some supplements because it's that money that helps us stay on air in the face of this thing
[2:38:22.680 --> 2:38:27.560]  I need your help more than ever now I want to keep fighting the globalist but I can't
[2:38:27.560 --> 2:38:32.600]  do it if you don't support us so pray for us word of mouth tell folks about the broadcast

[2:38:43.440 --> 2:38:49.160]  of it nurtures the soul all of it empowers humanity all of it is pro-human and pro god
[2:38:49.160 --> 2:38:56.920]  thank you so much humanity has been domesticated by and large the population has been trained
[2:38:56.920 --> 2:39:01.960]  to submit do what you're told it's all going to pass but if you study authoritarians if
[2:39:01.960 --> 2:39:05.200]  you study the globalist you understand that they reach a point where all the training
[2:39:05.200 --> 2:39:09.600]  is just beta and you go into the point of being cold being totally enslaved and because
[2:39:09.600 --> 2:39:13.840]  the globalist see us as weak and see us as stupid they are now making that move and they
[2:39:13.840 --> 2:39:17.960]  are collapsing the third world with their economic weapons to then flood us with the
[2:39:17.960 --> 2:39:23.600]  third world that the UN will use as a weapon to then have us under such a crisis under
[2:39:23.600 --> 2:39:28.520]  such a load capitulate to the UN whatever agreements they want us to sign hoping that
[2:39:28.520 --> 2:39:34.200]  they will stop the flood of tens of millions of refugees not fleeing COVID or climate
[2:39:34.200 --> 2:39:39.080]  change as the UN and Klaus Schwabber saying and Bill Gates is saying but fleeing the year
[2:39:39.080 --> 2:39:44.800]  long lockdowns that the UN and Bill Gates ordered them to institute or they wouldn't
[2:39:44.800 --> 2:39:50.600]  get more IMF and World Bank money and that's why we have to really get educated about the
[2:39:50.600 --> 2:39:51.600]  globalist.
[2:39:51.600 --> 2:39:56.320]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone
[2:39:56.320 --> 2:39:59.040]  from beta testing to operational.
[2:39:59.040 --> 2:40:03.800]  The globalist are out of the open with their planetary depopulation takeover their robot
[2:40:03.800 --> 2:40:07.920]  takeover but the good news is we've been working and you've been working and others have been
[2:40:07.920 --> 2:40:12.840]  working across the planet for decades to get ready for this to be able to find it on humanity
[2:40:12.840 --> 2:40:17.400]  is strong we're incredible and if we're aware of the attack that's happening we have a real
[2:40:17.400 --> 2:40:22.400]  chance of defeating it if we ask God for guidance we will defeat it so prayer is essential
[2:40:22.400 --> 2:40:26.520]  research is essential getting prepared is essential and warning others is absolutely
[2:40:26.520 --> 2:40:31.280]  essential and at the same time supporting info wars by buying high quality products
[2:40:31.280 --> 2:40:35.120]  to keep us on air is essential because they're great products for you and your family and

[2:41:02.160 --> 2:41:30.200]  go
[2:41:30.200 --> 2:41:35.200]  Ain't nobody feeling no pain
[2:41:35.200 --> 2:41:37.200]  Welcome back, folks. Alex Jones here live.
[2:41:37.200 --> 2:41:41.200]  And I wish I would have read the little tags the callers tell us
[2:41:41.200 --> 2:41:43.200]  how to go on with this caller earlier
[2:41:43.200 --> 2:41:45.200]  here on The Alex Jones Show.
[2:41:45.200 --> 2:41:47.200]  Anonymous in PA.
[2:41:47.200 --> 2:41:49.200]  Caller is transgender on the topic of trans people.
[2:41:49.200 --> 2:41:51.200]  So I'm glad you called in about that.
[2:41:51.200 --> 2:41:54.200]  Look, I don't hate anybody for what color they are
[2:41:54.200 --> 2:41:56.200]  or what they want to be or any of that.
[2:41:56.200 --> 2:42:00.200]  I don't like the takeover of bathrooms,
[2:42:00.200 --> 2:42:04.200]  the coming in and saying biological men
[2:42:04.200 --> 2:42:06.200]  are going to compete against women.
[2:42:06.200 --> 2:42:10.200]  It flies in the face of reality.
[2:42:10.200 --> 2:42:15.200]  And again, they want to use people that want to be something else
[2:42:15.200 --> 2:42:17.200]  or feel like there's something else.
[2:42:17.200 --> 2:42:19.200]  As the new frontier of freedom,
[2:42:19.200 --> 2:42:22.200]  all our other basic freedoms of privacy and everything else
[2:42:22.200 --> 2:42:25.200]  are taken away and 5G frying us and everything.
[2:42:25.200 --> 2:42:27.200]  And they want to just set the precedent
[2:42:27.200 --> 2:42:30.200]  where it will accept a biological man
[2:42:30.200 --> 2:42:33.200]  who wants to be a woman competing in women's sports.
[2:42:33.200 --> 2:42:35.200]  We will accept transhumanism, the cyborgs,
[2:42:35.200 --> 2:42:37.200]  and that whole system.
[2:42:37.200 --> 2:42:40.200]  And it's the very group pushing that that's doing it.
[2:42:40.200 --> 2:42:42.200]  And I don't want mentally retarded children targeted
[2:42:42.200 --> 2:42:44.200]  and said, you know, you're really a girl.
[2:42:44.200 --> 2:42:46.200]  We're going to give you attention now
[2:42:46.200 --> 2:42:48.200]  and tell them they're a girl because they're autistic.
[2:42:48.200 --> 2:42:51.200]  And then they go and demand to have their genitals cut off.
[2:42:51.200 --> 2:42:53.200]  So that's my view.
[2:42:53.200 --> 2:42:55.200]  I've already said my statement there.
[2:42:55.200 --> 2:42:56.200]  Anonymous, go ahead.
[2:42:56.200 --> 2:42:59.200]  What's your view on this?
[2:42:59.200 --> 2:43:00.200]  Yes, hello. Can you hear me?
[2:43:00.200 --> 2:43:02.200]  I can. Welcome. Go ahead.
[2:43:02.200 --> 2:43:04.200]  Great, great.
[2:43:04.200 --> 2:43:05.200]  Thank you so much for having me on.
[2:43:05.200 --> 2:43:07.200]  I take DNA force.
[2:43:07.200 --> 2:43:09.200]  I've been taking it for the last two weeks.
[2:43:09.200 --> 2:43:10.200]  It's awesome.
[2:43:10.200 --> 2:43:12.200]  I'm feeling so much better with my neck and my back
[2:43:12.200 --> 2:43:14.200]  and a lot of chronic pain.
[2:43:14.200 --> 2:43:16.200]  I just wanted to say that off the top, but...
[2:43:16.200 --> 2:43:18.200]  Well, I appreciate your support and I appreciate you calling in.
[2:43:18.200 --> 2:43:20.200]  Yes. Thank you so much.
[2:43:20.200 --> 2:43:22.200]  I know we don't have a lot of time.
[2:43:22.200 --> 2:43:25.200]  It's just one major thing about the trans community.
[2:43:25.200 --> 2:43:30.200]  We have, unfortunately, sex offenders and pedophiles
[2:43:30.200 --> 2:43:35.200]  that try to use that small window of freedom
[2:43:35.200 --> 2:43:38.200]  that a lot of us trans women and trans men
[2:43:38.200 --> 2:43:42.200]  are given to take up our choice
[2:43:42.200 --> 2:43:44.200]  that we can take in the United States of America
[2:43:44.200 --> 2:43:47.200]  to change our gender marker, change our name,
[2:43:47.200 --> 2:43:50.200]  and live our lives as whatever gender we wish
[2:43:50.200 --> 2:43:53.200]  are not, you know, attending to harm people
[2:43:53.200 --> 2:43:55.200]  or indoctrinating children or anything like that,
[2:43:55.200 --> 2:43:58.200]  want to live our lives, date whoever we want, you know,
[2:43:58.200 --> 2:44:01.200]  espouse whatever political views we want.
[2:44:01.200 --> 2:44:05.200]  That's everything we have in this country, which I love.
[2:44:05.200 --> 2:44:10.200]  And there are people that need to be taken to justice,
[2:44:10.200 --> 2:44:12.200]  like that weak spot issue. That's horrible.
[2:44:12.200 --> 2:44:16.200]  That person should be in jail and, you know, whatever else.
[2:44:16.200 --> 2:44:22.200]  And I just wanted to mention the Olympic situation.
[2:44:22.200 --> 2:44:25.200]  That person did have sexual reassignment surgery in 2012.
[2:44:25.200 --> 2:44:27.200]  Obviously, that doesn't matter.
[2:44:27.200 --> 2:44:29.200]  It's just the genetic differences
[2:44:29.200 --> 2:44:31.200]  between someone who's had testosterone
[2:44:31.200 --> 2:44:33.200]  for the first 30-some odd years of their life
[2:44:33.200 --> 2:44:35.200]  and then they transition.
[2:44:35.200 --> 2:44:37.200]  You can't compare. It's not fair.
[2:44:37.200 --> 2:44:39.200]  So people are saying follow the science
[2:44:39.200 --> 2:44:41.200]  or code and things like that.
[2:44:41.200 --> 2:44:43.200]  They're obviously not following the science there.
[2:44:43.200 --> 2:44:45.200]  Well, it sounds like you're not a woman hater.
[2:44:45.200 --> 2:44:47.200]  The other thing is there are certain groups
[2:44:47.200 --> 2:44:49.200]  in the whole Hollywood camp that just hate everything
[2:44:49.200 --> 2:44:51.200]  and want to overturn things.
[2:44:51.200 --> 2:44:53.200]  And so I'm not judging people that feel a certain way
[2:44:53.200 --> 2:44:55.200]  or have proclivities a certain way.
[2:44:55.200 --> 2:44:57.200]  And we know with the chemicals in euro now,
[2:44:57.200 --> 2:44:59.200]  male fetuses are more female.
[2:44:59.200 --> 2:45:02.200]  And so it is becoming a real truth.
[2:45:02.200 --> 2:45:04.200]  And there's always been people that have those, you know,
[2:45:04.200 --> 2:45:06.200]  those inclinations. I don't hate them.
[2:45:06.200 --> 2:45:10.200]  My issue is we have a small lake in East Texas
[2:45:10.200 --> 2:45:13.200]  that has carp that they put a few drops of a chemical in
[2:45:13.200 --> 2:45:15.200]  when they were eggs and they're all sterile.
[2:45:15.200 --> 2:45:18.200]  And, you know, Japan is putting out fish
[2:45:18.200 --> 2:45:21.200]  that are all female and they use a chemical.
[2:45:21.200 --> 2:45:24.200]  They feed them out of soybean to make the males female
[2:45:24.200 --> 2:45:26.200]  because females are bigger.
[2:45:26.200 --> 2:45:28.200]  And I'm just saying what they're doing to us
[2:45:28.200 --> 2:45:31.200]  is to make us more males, more feminine
[2:45:31.200 --> 2:45:33.200]  so that we don't reproduce.
[2:45:33.200 --> 2:45:36.200]  It's not any attack on you that maybe you already have
[2:45:36.200 --> 2:45:39.200]  these proclivities or your genetic line or whatever it is,
[2:45:39.200 --> 2:45:41.200]  but the argument that people used to say,
[2:45:41.200 --> 2:45:43.200]  it's natural to be gay or it's natural to be,
[2:45:43.200 --> 2:45:45.200]  well, actually it is.
[2:45:45.200 --> 2:45:47.200]  Because the chemicals in the process are doing it.
[2:45:47.200 --> 2:45:49.200]  Penises are getting smaller.
[2:45:49.200 --> 2:45:51.200]  Sperm counts are imploding.
[2:45:51.200 --> 2:45:54.200]  And in utero, especially in the first six weeks,
[2:45:54.200 --> 2:45:57.200]  the few chemicals that we know were in the food alone
[2:45:57.200 --> 2:46:01.200]  turned these into more sexless children, really,
[2:46:01.200 --> 2:46:03.200]  who aren't male or aren't female
[2:46:03.200 --> 2:46:05.200]  and are becoming more androgynous.
[2:46:05.200 --> 2:46:07.200]  So I don't judge anybody.
[2:46:07.200 --> 2:46:09.200]  I mean, you go out and look at the average male.
[2:46:09.200 --> 2:46:11.200]  You're going to see what it's like to look like.
[2:46:11.200 --> 2:46:13.200]  And I mean, I'm pretty masculine
[2:46:13.200 --> 2:46:15.200]  and compared to, say, my dad's dad,
[2:46:15.200 --> 2:46:17.200]  I mean, I'm not as masculine as he was
[2:46:17.200 --> 2:46:19.200]  or even my mom's dad.
[2:46:19.200 --> 2:46:21.200]  And the people are extremely masculine.
[2:46:21.200 --> 2:46:22.200]  And that scared the system.
[2:46:22.200 --> 2:46:24.200]  They were scared of men like that.
[2:46:24.200 --> 2:46:26.200]  And so they put chemicals in the food and water
[2:46:26.200 --> 2:46:28.200]  to do what they've done now.
[2:46:28.200 --> 2:46:29.200]  And so that's my view.
[2:46:29.200 --> 2:46:31.200]  What's your view?
[2:46:31.200 --> 2:46:33.200]  And I totally agree with everything that you just said.
[2:46:33.200 --> 2:46:35.200]  I watch you all the time.
[2:46:35.200 --> 2:46:37.200]  And in all likelihood, just someone like me
[2:46:37.200 --> 2:46:43.200]  had steroids that I took for an illness
[2:46:43.200 --> 2:46:46.200]  when I was younger or it was vaccinations
[2:46:46.200 --> 2:46:49.200]  or it was something in the water,
[2:46:49.200 --> 2:46:50.200]  something in utero.
[2:46:50.200 --> 2:46:52.200]  It could have been anything that could have changed
[2:46:52.200 --> 2:46:58.200]  my productivity to go towards being a transgender woman.
[2:46:58.200 --> 2:47:00.200]  There are a lot of people who probably have similar stories.
[2:47:00.200 --> 2:47:02.200]  Well, let's expand on that.
[2:47:02.200 --> 2:47:03.200]  My dad is short.
[2:47:03.200 --> 2:47:04.200]  He doesn't care.
[2:47:04.200 --> 2:47:06.200]  It's fine with him because he was playing football
[2:47:06.200 --> 2:47:08.200]  in junior high, hurt his knees,
[2:47:08.200 --> 2:47:10.200]  and they just gave him steroids to get over it
[2:47:10.200 --> 2:47:12.200]  back then and that stung his growth.
[2:47:12.200 --> 2:47:15.200]  So his dad was like 6'3 and he's like 5'8 or whatever.
[2:47:15.200 --> 2:47:17.200]  But I mean, that's just an example
[2:47:17.200 --> 2:47:19.200]  of what chemicals do in children.
[2:47:19.200 --> 2:47:22.200]  And so we don't hate anybody with this process,
[2:47:22.200 --> 2:47:24.200]  but also they don't want us discussing this
[2:47:24.200 --> 2:47:26.200]  when they know full well what they've done.
[2:47:26.200 --> 2:47:29.200]  I'd like to interview you sometime as a whole guest anonymous.
[2:47:29.200 --> 2:47:31.200]  So if you want to give us your name and number,
[2:47:31.200 --> 2:47:33.200]  we won't give it out or you can be anonymous.
[2:47:33.200 --> 2:47:39.200]  Get her number and we'll try to get you on sometime.
[2:47:39.200 --> 2:47:42.200]  And again, I'm not poo pooing the fact that you want to be a woman.
[2:47:42.200 --> 2:47:44.200]  You have the proclivity and you lean that direction
[2:47:44.200 --> 2:47:46.200]  and chemically it probably changed your brain makeup
[2:47:46.200 --> 2:47:47.200]  and everything.
[2:47:47.200 --> 2:47:48.200]  I get it.
[2:47:48.200 --> 2:47:50.200]  I don't like the fact they try to make me say
[2:47:50.200 --> 2:47:54.200]  some 6'4 convict is a woman when he's clearly not.
[2:47:54.200 --> 2:47:55.200]  That's what I'm getting.
[2:47:55.200 --> 2:47:58.200]  Like you said, the pedophiles, the criminals, the ex-cons
[2:47:58.200 --> 2:48:00.200]  using this to act like monsters.
[2:48:00.200 --> 2:48:01.200]  Really great point.
[2:48:01.200 --> 2:48:03.200]  I'm glad you called if you want to pop in as a guest sometime.
[2:48:03.200 --> 2:48:06.200]  Might be good to have a larger discussion about that.
[2:48:06.200 --> 2:48:10.200]  Okay, let's talk to Thomas speaking of the human
[2:48:10.200 --> 2:48:12.200]  replacement plan, Microsoft, the digital twin.
[2:48:12.200 --> 2:48:14.200]  Tell us about that.
[2:48:14.200 --> 2:48:16.200]  Hello there, Alex.
[2:48:16.200 --> 2:48:20.200]  You often talk about the globalist agenda for depopulation
[2:48:20.200 --> 2:48:25.200]  and many people wonder where is the economy going to be
[2:48:25.200 --> 2:48:28.200]  if there's a greatly reduced number of people
[2:48:28.200 --> 2:48:31.200]  and clearly some of the people that have these schemes
[2:48:31.200 --> 2:48:36.200]  at foot are more concerned about going to a carbon neutral,
[2:48:36.200 --> 2:48:40.200]  negative carbon sequestration type system
[2:48:40.200 --> 2:48:43.200]  and having found that locking down the world's economy
[2:48:43.200 --> 2:48:47.200]  only produced carbon output by 15%.
[2:48:47.200 --> 2:48:50.200]  They now know that that's nowhere near enough
[2:48:50.200 --> 2:48:52.200]  in order to get to the cell.
[2:48:52.200 --> 2:48:54.200]  They set up a benchmark that lets them totally take over
[2:48:54.200 --> 2:48:56.200]  the planet and dominate and control everyone
[2:48:56.200 --> 2:48:58.200]  where they announced that carbon, which were carbon-based life
[2:48:58.200 --> 2:49:00.200]  forms, is evil.
[2:49:00.200 --> 2:49:03.200]  It is an asinine equation designed to be the total
[2:49:03.200 --> 2:49:07.200]  extreme use for an overwrite of the entire system
[2:49:07.200 --> 2:49:09.200]  of the planet, not just humans.
[2:49:09.200 --> 2:49:11.200]  Sorry, go ahead.
[2:49:11.200 --> 2:49:14.200]  I quite agree, but the point is,
[2:49:14.200 --> 2:49:17.200]  if shutting down the entire world's economy for a year
[2:49:17.200 --> 2:49:20.200]  only gives you 15%, you've got to say what's next
[2:49:20.200 --> 2:49:22.200]  and they've had the scheme what's next
[2:49:22.200 --> 2:49:24.200]  at foot for quite some time.
[2:49:24.200 --> 2:49:27.200]  It started in 2009 with NASA
[2:49:27.200 --> 2:49:30.200]  trying to model the performance of spacecraft
[2:49:30.200 --> 2:49:33.200]  and then went into building management
[2:49:33.200 --> 2:49:36.200]  and it's a concept called digital twins
[2:49:36.200 --> 2:49:40.200]  and it's basically you cover a physical object
[2:49:40.200 --> 2:49:43.200]  completely with sensors
[2:49:43.200 --> 2:49:46.200]  and then use artificial intelligence and machine learning
[2:49:46.200 --> 2:49:50.200]  to determine how that physical object
[2:49:50.200 --> 2:49:54.200]  performs in every single circumstance.
[2:49:54.200 --> 2:49:58.200]  So in cold weather, in high humidity, in high winds,
[2:49:58.200 --> 2:50:00.200]  in high temperatures, et cetera, et cetera.
[2:50:00.200 --> 2:50:04.200]  But they have a new concept, which if not
[2:50:04.200 --> 2:50:07.200]  just some theory, it's actually been espoused
[2:50:07.200 --> 2:50:10.200]  by Thierry Britton, the EU commissioner
[2:50:10.200 --> 2:50:12.200]  for digital services
[2:50:12.200 --> 2:50:16.200]  and also by Crystal van der Elft
[2:50:16.200 --> 2:50:18.200]  who is currently the director general
[2:50:18.200 --> 2:50:21.200]  of Policy Horizons in Canada
[2:50:21.200 --> 2:50:23.200]  who wrote papers last year
[2:50:23.200 --> 2:50:25.200]  and this year on the very subject,
[2:50:25.200 --> 2:50:29.200]  she was the senior strategic policy director
[2:50:29.200 --> 2:50:34.200]  and on the World Economic Forum Executive Committee
[2:50:34.200 --> 2:50:37.200]  and personally I think she actually goes through
[2:50:37.200 --> 2:50:40.200]  Charles Schwab's last couple of books
[2:50:40.200 --> 2:50:42.200]  if you look at some of her papers.
[2:50:42.200 --> 2:50:47.200]  I know she's definitely the big workhorse up there.
[2:50:47.200 --> 2:50:51.200]  Put forward this idea that it's possible
[2:50:51.200 --> 2:50:55.200]  to create human digital twins
[2:50:55.200 --> 2:50:59.200]  that will and of themselves become valuable,
[2:50:59.200 --> 2:51:02.200]  tradable assets.
[2:51:02.200 --> 2:51:05.200]  Now if you look at how they create digital twins.
[2:51:05.200 --> 2:51:06.200]  Hold on, don't hang up.
[2:51:06.200 --> 2:51:09.200]  Paul Watson's coming up, but I got to hold you over
[2:51:09.200 --> 2:51:11.200]  because what you're hitting is their entire future.
[2:51:11.200 --> 2:51:13.200]  They're going to say, carbon is bad,
[2:51:13.200 --> 2:51:15.200]  you've got to upload to this twin
[2:51:15.200 --> 2:51:17.200]  and then your body's going to die.
[2:51:17.200 --> 2:51:23.200]  And then the con is, oh, that's a transhuman to digital.
[2:51:23.200 --> 2:51:25.200]  And so, oh, we've got to get rid of your body,
[2:51:25.200 --> 2:51:27.200]  not just live in a tank so there's no violence.
[2:51:27.200 --> 2:51:29.200]  The matrix plan, it was a Pentagon plan from 77,
[2:51:29.200 --> 2:51:32.200]  but an actual in-your-body upload to a machine
[2:51:32.200 --> 2:51:35.200]  which is childhoods in plan.
[2:51:35.200 --> 2:51:36.200]  It's always the same plan.
[2:51:36.200 --> 2:51:39.200]  We'll come right back to you, stay with us.
[2:51:39.200 --> 2:51:42.200]  In the early 1990s, there was a really funny movie
[2:51:42.200 --> 2:51:45.200]  that came out called Wayne's World.
[2:51:45.200 --> 2:51:48.200]  Wayne's World! Wayne's World!
[2:51:48.200 --> 2:51:51.200]  Even before I had an access to your show in the mid-1990s,
[2:51:51.200 --> 2:51:53.200]  I wouldn't call that movie and thought,
[2:51:53.200 --> 2:51:54.200]  man, that looks fun.
[2:51:54.200 --> 2:51:57.200]  Practice to speak out and have your own ideas
[2:51:57.200 --> 2:51:58.200]  and even if you're a nerd,
[2:51:58.200 --> 2:52:00.200]  you're still entertaining because you're real.
[2:52:00.200 --> 2:52:02.200]  Well, what do they say in Wayne's World?
[2:52:02.200 --> 2:52:05.200]  We're not worthy! We're not worthy!
[2:52:05.200 --> 2:52:08.200]  Every day when I cover these huge topics,
[2:52:08.200 --> 2:52:10.200]  I don't feel worthy to talk to you
[2:52:10.200 --> 2:52:12.200]  because these topics are so huge or so real.
[2:52:12.200 --> 2:52:13.200]  But I'm trying to tell you the truth.
[2:52:13.200 --> 2:52:15.200]  I'm trying to get it right and most of the time we do.
[2:52:15.200 --> 2:52:17.200]  The globalists love lying to you.
[2:52:17.200 --> 2:52:18.200]  They love manipulating you.
[2:52:18.200 --> 2:52:21.200]  They enjoy destroying humanity.
[2:52:21.200 --> 2:52:23.200]  They enjoy manipulating ideas
[2:52:23.200 --> 2:52:25.200]  and using people's ignorance against them.
[2:52:25.200 --> 2:52:29.200]  That, for me, is really said to have and disgusting.
[2:52:29.200 --> 2:52:30.200]  So you've got to pledge for myself
[2:52:30.200 --> 2:52:32.200]  and the whole InfoWars crew
[2:52:32.200 --> 2:52:35.200]  that we will never join the globalists.
[2:52:35.200 --> 2:52:37.200]  We will never knowingly manipulate you
[2:52:37.200 --> 2:52:41.200]  because we know we're all in this together.
[2:52:41.200 --> 2:52:45.200]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown
[2:52:45.200 --> 2:52:50.200]  in vitality, energy, and overall wellness.
[2:52:50.200 --> 2:52:54.200]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas
[2:52:54.200 --> 2:52:58.200]  to date, Super Male Vitality.
[2:52:58.200 --> 2:53:01.200]  Specifically designed to assist the body
[2:53:01.200 --> 2:53:03.200]  in regulating proper balance
[2:53:03.200 --> 2:53:06.200]  to create superior vitality in males.
[2:53:06.200 --> 2:53:08.200]  Now look, this unique formula
[2:53:08.200 --> 2:53:11.200]  promotes your body's own natural responses
[2:53:11.200 --> 2:53:14.200]  and it contains no synthetic chemicals
[2:53:14.200 --> 2:53:17.200]  and no unwanted additives.
[2:53:17.200 --> 2:53:20.200]  Yes, we're talking about ancient wisdom
[2:53:20.200 --> 2:53:23.200]  combined with modern technology.
[2:53:23.200 --> 2:53:26.200]  Working together in perfect synchronicity
[2:53:26.200 --> 2:53:30.200]  to help you get the most out of this herb-packed formula.
[2:53:30.200 --> 2:53:31.200]  So what are you waiting for?
[2:53:31.200 --> 2:53:33.200]  Go to the InfoWars store.
[2:53:33.200 --> 2:53:35.200]  Never been a better time than right now.
[2:53:35.200 --> 2:53:40.200]  Super Male Vitality at InfoWarsStore.com
[2:53:40.200 --> 2:54:05.200]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[2:54:05.200 --> 2:54:07.200]  Man, I would have loved to have gotten all these calls.
[2:54:07.200 --> 2:54:10.200]  We still got Tony and Kristen and Paul and a bunch of others.
[2:54:10.200 --> 2:54:11.200]  We're talking to Thomas.
[2:54:11.200 --> 2:54:13.200]  The calls are all so good today.
[2:54:13.200 --> 2:54:14.200]  They're always excellent.
[2:54:14.200 --> 2:54:17.200]  Man, these are smart people calling in today.
[2:54:17.200 --> 2:54:18.200]  Wow.
[2:54:18.200 --> 2:54:21.200]  Thomas and Florida, I'm aware of what you're getting into.
[2:54:21.200 --> 2:54:23.200]  I'm aware of their plan.
[2:54:23.200 --> 2:54:25.200]  They want to be able to have people that link themselves up
[2:54:25.200 --> 2:54:27.200]  with all these chips and trackers
[2:54:27.200 --> 2:54:31.200]  and then Microsoft and others will pay you
[2:54:31.200 --> 2:54:33.200]  to basically go around in that for a year.
[2:54:33.200 --> 2:54:35.200]  Then they create a digital identity
[2:54:35.200 --> 2:54:37.200]  and then now the next things they're going to claim,
[2:54:37.200 --> 2:54:39.200]  these things have rights.
[2:54:39.200 --> 2:54:42.200]  And just like, oh, well, a man can be a woman.
[2:54:42.200 --> 2:54:45.200]  Well, now this computer can have rights.
[2:54:45.200 --> 2:54:49.200]  And the ultimate end game is you upload yourself to a machine.
[2:54:49.200 --> 2:54:51.200]  It's mimicked you for years.
[2:54:51.200 --> 2:54:52.200]  It knows everything about you.
[2:54:52.200 --> 2:54:55.200]  It can fool people, but it's not you,
[2:54:55.200 --> 2:54:57.200]  but it's death penalty.
[2:54:57.200 --> 2:55:00.200]  If you say it's a fraud, that's going to be the ultimate sin.
[2:55:00.200 --> 2:55:03.200]  So it's the seduction into the fraud of eternal life,
[2:55:03.200 --> 2:55:06.200]  but it's not, it is the biggest fraud ever.
[2:55:06.200 --> 2:55:08.200]  And what you're hearing within 10 years
[2:55:08.200 --> 2:55:10.200]  will be the number one thing in the world.
[2:55:10.200 --> 2:55:12.200]  It's all anyone will be talking about
[2:55:12.200 --> 2:55:14.200]  and they'll let you party and all that.
[2:55:14.200 --> 2:55:16.200]  You'll be a hero when you give up your body.
[2:55:16.200 --> 2:55:19.200]  You'll be euthanized, but it's not euthanasia
[2:55:19.200 --> 2:55:23.200]  because you're going on to the new digital fact totem
[2:55:23.200 --> 2:55:25.200]  or legged.
[2:55:25.200 --> 2:55:27.200]  Please continue.
[2:55:27.200 --> 2:55:30.200]  So that's all exactly correct, Alex.
[2:55:30.200 --> 2:55:33.200]  So some people, this may sound like science fiction,
[2:55:33.200 --> 2:55:36.200]  but if you think even hundreds of years ago,
[2:55:36.200 --> 2:55:39.200]  it was revolutionary when it was decided that a company
[2:55:39.200 --> 2:55:42.200]  could be treated as a legal person.
[2:55:42.200 --> 2:55:44.200]  And you'll remember when Romney ran for president,
[2:55:44.200 --> 2:55:48.200]  he confirmed, yes, of course, companies are people.
[2:55:48.200 --> 2:55:51.200]  We talked about rights of corporations.
[2:55:51.200 --> 2:55:55.200]  Then the next development was intellectual property.
[2:55:55.200 --> 2:55:57.200]  And so if you have intellectual property,
[2:55:57.200 --> 2:56:00.200]  then why couldn't you actually have the personality
[2:56:00.200 --> 2:56:03.200]  contained within a computer?
[2:56:03.200 --> 2:56:05.200]  Now, the problem with human beings
[2:56:05.200 --> 2:56:09.200]  is that they're experiencing so many sensations
[2:56:09.200 --> 2:56:14.200]  that you've had a problem with computing capacity.
[2:56:14.200 --> 2:56:17.200]  And now with the introduction of 5G and 6G,
[2:56:17.200 --> 2:56:20.200]  it's possible that if people have sensors within them,
[2:56:20.200 --> 2:56:23.200]  that everything that they're experiencing,
[2:56:23.200 --> 2:56:26.200]  even their thoughts before they are put into physical motion,
[2:56:26.200 --> 2:56:30.200]  can actually be uploaded far.
[2:56:30.200 --> 2:56:32.200]  That's right, and they're mapping this
[2:56:32.200 --> 2:56:35.200]  so that they can then make you have no excuse
[2:56:35.200 --> 2:56:37.200]  but to not leave your house because of carbon,
[2:56:37.200 --> 2:56:40.200]  but quote, your digital person will still be able to go around
[2:56:40.200 --> 2:56:43.200]  and experience the world through the whole 5G web.
[2:56:43.200 --> 2:56:45.200]  So you're really actually being imprisoned,
[2:56:45.200 --> 2:56:47.200]  but they're going to claim as a form of empowerment.
[2:56:47.200 --> 2:56:53.200]  Well, I think the physical being, it consumes food.
[2:56:53.200 --> 2:56:55.200]  It votes. It wants vacation.
[2:56:55.200 --> 2:56:56.200]  It gets sick.
[2:56:56.200 --> 2:57:01.200]  And you don't have any of those issues with the digital twin.
[2:57:01.200 --> 2:57:03.200]  And the advantage of the digital twin
[2:57:03.200 --> 2:57:05.200]  is just like transferring software
[2:57:05.200 --> 2:57:09.200]  or licensing software or licensing digital services
[2:57:09.200 --> 2:57:13.200]  is exactly possible to re-institute slavery
[2:57:13.200 --> 2:57:15.200]  via the digital person.
[2:57:15.200 --> 2:57:18.200]  And that's why they say, you know what, sir?
[2:57:18.200 --> 2:57:20.200]  I'm not just saying this last two or three collars.
[2:57:20.200 --> 2:57:22.200]  It's just when everything happens in threes or fours,
[2:57:22.200 --> 2:57:24.200]  you've got to come on as a guest.
[2:57:24.200 --> 2:57:25.200]  I don't need to know who you are.
[2:57:25.200 --> 2:57:27.200]  I know you know what you're talking about.
[2:57:27.200 --> 2:57:30.200]  This is exactly what you're saying is the entire future.
[2:57:30.200 --> 2:57:32.200]  This is everything what he's saying.
[2:57:32.200 --> 2:57:36.200]  When do you want to come on this week for 30 minutes?
[2:57:36.200 --> 2:57:38.200]  Maybe we can do audio Skype as your phone's breaking up
[2:57:38.200 --> 2:57:41.200]  so you can really send us any emails you want and stuff.
[2:57:41.200 --> 2:57:43.200]  And then we'll do a half hour on this.
[2:57:43.200 --> 2:57:45.200]  When do you want to do it?
[2:57:45.200 --> 2:57:48.200]  Certainly I'll make myself available at your discretion.
[2:57:48.200 --> 2:57:49.200]  All right.
[2:57:49.200 --> 2:57:51.200]  I want to know a little bit about you,
[2:57:51.200 --> 2:57:53.200]  hypothetically just or not hypothetically,
[2:57:53.200 --> 2:57:55.200]  without who you are specifically,
[2:57:55.200 --> 2:57:57.200]  how you woke up your concerns personally.
[2:57:57.200 --> 2:58:01.200]  So Scott set up Thomas sometime this week.
[2:58:01.200 --> 2:58:03.200]  I also want to do some extra taping this week
[2:58:03.200 --> 2:58:05.200]  outside of the live shows so I can have even more
[2:58:05.200 --> 2:58:07.200]  because I want to just, there's so much to cover.
[2:58:07.200 --> 2:58:09.200]  Three hours of live is not enough.
[2:58:09.200 --> 2:58:11.200]  Paul Watson's coming up.
[2:58:11.200 --> 2:58:12.200]  So don't hang up, Thomas.
[2:58:12.200 --> 2:58:15.200]  We're going to get the last two collars definitely on as guests
[2:58:15.200 --> 2:58:18.200]  because I find the collars a lot of them to be
[2:58:18.200 --> 2:58:19.200]  as interesting as our guests.
[2:58:19.200 --> 2:58:20.200]  Okay.
[2:58:20.200 --> 2:58:22.200]  Speaking of calling people back,
[2:58:22.200 --> 2:58:24.200]  and Kristen and Paul, I can't cut Watson off.
[2:58:24.200 --> 2:58:26.200]  He's got a lot to say and a lot to do.
[2:58:26.200 --> 2:58:28.200]  I promise you, don't let me forget John.
[2:58:28.200 --> 2:58:29.200]  John Harmon in there.
[2:58:29.200 --> 2:58:31.200]  I will call you back first thing tomorrow
[2:58:31.200 --> 2:58:33.200]  when we take calls and you'll come back on with us.
[2:58:33.200 --> 2:58:36.200]  Please, I respect you, but we had so many other great collars
[2:58:36.200 --> 2:58:37.200]  I didn't get to you.
[2:58:37.200 --> 2:58:38.200]  All right.
[2:58:38.200 --> 2:58:39.200]  Paul Joseph Watson is about to take over.
[2:58:39.200 --> 2:58:40.200]  I'm going to introduce him.
[2:58:40.200 --> 2:58:42.200]  There's a lot of news I didn't get to,
[2:58:42.200 --> 2:58:45.200]  but we're going to try as best we can to cover it all.
[2:58:48.200 --> 2:58:51.200]  Well, all the big box stores are making record profits.
[2:58:51.200 --> 2:58:56.200]  So is Amazon because they designed the global shutdown
[2:58:56.200 --> 2:58:59.200]  to destroy small and medium-sized businesses.
[2:58:59.200 --> 2:59:03.200]  And it is wreaking havoc in the supply chain.
[2:59:03.200 --> 2:59:06.200]  Thousands and thousands of small companies
[2:59:06.200 --> 2:59:08.200]  have completely shut down,
[2:59:08.200 --> 2:59:10.200]  and others are struggling to stay open
[2:59:10.200 --> 2:59:13.200]  because they can't get raw materials,
[2:59:13.200 --> 2:59:15.200]  whether it's for food, whether it's for medicine,
[2:59:15.200 --> 2:59:17.200]  whether it's for supplements, whether it's for textiles.
[2:59:17.200 --> 2:59:20.200]  Whatever the product is, you see it in the news.
[2:59:20.200 --> 2:59:23.200]  It is record-level supply chain breakdowns
[2:59:23.200 --> 2:59:25.200]  because the global has shut down the world economy
[2:59:25.200 --> 2:59:26.200]  for more than a year,
[2:59:26.200 --> 2:59:28.200]  and now they're trying to bring the shutdown back again.
[2:59:28.200 --> 2:59:31.200]  In fact, in areas like India and in areas of Africa,
[2:59:31.200 --> 2:59:33.200]  the shutdown is ongoing.
[2:59:33.200 --> 2:59:36.200]  It's killing those people in massive numbers.
[2:59:36.200 --> 2:59:38.200]  So the Impal Wars doesn't have a lot of our
[2:59:38.200 --> 2:59:39.200]  best-selling products anymore,
[2:59:39.200 --> 2:59:40.200]  six, seven, eight months.
[2:59:40.200 --> 2:59:42.200]  Because of this, so to make up a short call,
[2:59:42.200 --> 2:59:45.200]  please buy T-shirts, books, films, things like that
[2:59:45.200 --> 2:59:50.200]  at impalwars.com, and please try to keep us on the air.
[2:59:50.200 --> 3:00:02.200]  He aligns himself with the truth,
[3:00:02.200 --> 3:00:05.200]  and it's time for you to choose a side.
[3:00:05.200 --> 3:00:11.200]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[3:00:11.200 --> 3:00:13.200]  All right, it's the great Tudor Jennings,
[3:00:13.200 --> 3:00:16.200]  Summer of Rage, bringing us in live.
[3:00:16.200 --> 3:00:20.200]  All Joseph Watson from the United Kingdom
[3:00:20.200 --> 3:00:22.200]  is about to take over,
[3:00:22.200 --> 3:00:24.200]  and we'll have a fitting intro for him and everything.
[3:00:24.200 --> 3:00:27.200]  I'm sorry to be bugging in here a little bit
[3:00:27.200 --> 3:00:28.200]  right at the start of this hour,
[3:00:28.200 --> 3:00:30.200]  but I did not plug last hour,
[3:00:30.200 --> 3:00:32.200]  and if we don't plug, we won't be here
[3:00:32.200 --> 3:00:35.200]  because we've been in the red, in the black all year long.
[3:00:35.200 --> 3:00:37.200]  I have a big organization.
[3:00:37.200 --> 3:00:38.200]  We have to have our own infrastructure,
[3:00:38.200 --> 3:00:41.200]  our own satellite uplinks, our own legal or everything.
[3:00:41.200 --> 3:00:43.200]  Democrats suing us, trying to shut us down.
[3:00:43.200 --> 3:00:44.200]  You see that ongoing battle.
[3:00:44.200 --> 3:00:46.200]  We've got to stay on air.
[3:00:46.200 --> 3:00:49.200]  So we sell great products you already need at amazing prices,
[3:00:49.200 --> 3:00:51.200]  and you are literally fighting the new order
[3:00:51.200 --> 3:00:53.200]  toe-to-toe when you support us.
[3:00:53.200 --> 3:00:58.200]  Plus, these are really excellent, excellent products
[3:00:58.200 --> 3:01:00.200]  that we've got at impalwars.com.
[3:01:00.200 --> 3:01:03.200]  Now, X3 is three types of the highest quality iodine.
[3:01:03.200 --> 3:01:04.200]  It has sold out.
[3:01:04.200 --> 3:01:05.200]  It's back at regular price.
[3:01:05.200 --> 3:01:06.200]  There's almost none of it left.
[3:01:06.200 --> 3:01:08.200]  I added 60% off.
[3:01:08.200 --> 3:01:11.200]  Now, X2 is pure deep-growth crystal iodine.
[3:01:11.200 --> 3:01:13.200]  It's a good halogen, so popular
[3:01:13.200 --> 3:01:16.200]  what it does for stamina, energy, focus, libido.
[3:01:16.200 --> 3:01:17.200]  It's one of those essential things
[3:01:17.200 --> 3:01:19.200]  that 2 billion people, the UN admits,
[3:01:19.200 --> 3:01:24.200]  have cognitive disabilities, ladies and gentlemen,
[3:01:24.200 --> 3:01:31.200]  cognitive disabilities because they don't have it.
[3:01:31.200 --> 3:01:32.200]  Think of that.
[3:01:32.200 --> 3:01:34.200]  You can look that up and see what I'm Wikipedia.
[3:01:34.200 --> 3:01:36.200]  They don't want you having the good halogen.
[3:01:36.200 --> 3:01:38.200]  They want the fluoride, the bromine, the chlorine
[3:01:38.200 --> 3:01:39.200]  that's bombarding us.
[3:01:39.200 --> 3:01:40.200]  If your body doesn't have good iodine,
[3:01:40.200 --> 3:01:43.200]  it'll absorb the bad iodine.
[3:01:43.200 --> 3:01:44.200]  A lot of our products are sold out
[3:01:44.200 --> 3:01:45.200]  because of supply chain breakdowns
[3:01:45.200 --> 3:01:46.200]  that's happening everywhere.
[3:01:46.200 --> 3:01:47.200]  These are high-end.
[3:01:47.200 --> 3:01:48.200]  But we did get a good shipment of X2
[3:01:48.200 --> 3:01:50.200]  in about a month ago.
[3:01:50.200 --> 3:01:51.200]  We've already sold out a half of it
[3:01:51.200 --> 3:01:53.200]  because we couldn't get as big as we wanted.
[3:01:53.200 --> 3:01:54.200]  But despite that, because I want you to experience it
[3:01:54.200 --> 3:01:56.200]  and I want you to get off the fence,
[3:01:56.200 --> 3:01:59.200]  it's 40% off free shipping double-patria points.
[3:01:59.200 --> 3:02:01.200]  And I'm going to keep that until it sells out
[3:02:01.200 --> 3:02:02.200]  with free shipping double-patria points
[3:02:02.200 --> 3:02:04.200]  and 40% off.
[3:02:04.200 --> 3:02:06.200]  A lot of this stuff ends today, though,
[3:02:06.200 --> 3:02:09.200]  in the July 4th super sale.
[3:02:09.200 --> 3:02:11.200]  DNA Force Plus ends today 40% off
[3:02:11.200 --> 3:02:14.200]  because limited availability.
[3:02:14.200 --> 3:02:17.200]  Bodies 40% off, limited availability
[3:02:17.200 --> 3:02:19.200]  for the ultimate turmeric formula.
[3:02:19.200 --> 3:02:21.200]  Kerabov Force, that's going to end today 40% off.
[3:02:21.200 --> 3:02:23.200]  Alpha Power is going to go for about a week.
[3:02:23.200 --> 3:02:24.200]  We've got a good amount of that.
[3:02:24.200 --> 3:02:26.200]  40% off, it's amazing.
[3:02:26.200 --> 3:02:29.200]  Vasobes 50% off, creates the nitrous oxide in your blood.
[3:02:29.200 --> 3:02:31.200]  50% off, polyblock 40% off.

[3:02:34.200 --> 3:02:36.200]  Biotrystallinium from the mustard seed,
[3:02:36.200 --> 3:02:37.200]  essential in your entire body
[3:02:37.200 --> 3:02:39.200]  for all electrochemical activity in the cells.
[3:02:39.200 --> 3:02:42.200]  50% off, ultimate krill oil, super high end

[3:02:50.200 --> 3:02:52.200]  All swarable food, 10% off.
[3:02:52.200 --> 3:02:54.200]  And that's a big deal, folks, on those
[3:02:54.200 --> 3:02:56.200]  because there's not much margin.
[3:02:56.200 --> 3:03:01.200]  If you want to know more, go to AlphaWarsStore.com.
[3:03:01.200 --> 3:03:05.200]  Now, again, if you'll simply keep spreading the word
[3:03:05.200 --> 3:03:08.200]  about the broadcast, if you'll simply keep sharing the links,
[3:03:08.200 --> 3:03:12.200]  keep praying for us, and keep buying the products,
[3:03:12.200 --> 3:03:15.200]  we're going to do a lot of really exciting things.
[3:03:15.200 --> 3:03:17.200]  A lot of stuff behind the scenes we've been working on as well.
[3:03:17.200 --> 3:03:19.200]  A lot of it's very close to fruition,
[3:03:19.200 --> 3:03:22.200]  but loudest of the words of John Paul Jones,
[3:03:22.200 --> 3:03:24.200]  I have only begun to fight, so thank you for keeping us
[3:03:24.200 --> 3:03:27.200]  in the fight. Take advantage of the July 4 Supercell extended
[3:03:27.200 --> 3:03:30.200]  for four more days on the free Chevy Double Patriot points.
[3:03:30.200 --> 3:03:32.200]  But most of the stuff for sale is going to have to end
[3:03:32.200 --> 3:03:34.200]  because it's about to sell out.
[3:03:34.200 --> 3:03:37.200]  X2 is available. Take advantage of that.
[3:03:37.200 --> 3:03:40.200]  It will sell out in the next few weeks at that price as well,
[3:03:40.200 --> 3:03:43.200]  and I want you to experience how amazing it is.
[3:03:43.200 --> 3:03:45.200]  Then at 3 p.m. today, the War Room,
[3:03:45.200 --> 3:03:47.200]  Owen Schreuer, he just gets better and better.
[3:03:47.200 --> 3:03:49.200]  That's coming up today.
[3:03:49.200 --> 3:03:51.200]  So I'm going to end my segment of the transmission.
[3:03:51.200 --> 3:03:55.200]  Here is Paul Jones of Watson's intro from Summit.News.
[3:04:13.200 --> 3:04:18.200]  Transmitting worldwide from the Summit.News studios
[3:04:18.200 --> 3:04:23.200]  in the United Kingdom, you are listening to Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:04:26.200 --> 3:04:29.200]  Welcome back everybody to the Summit.News Hour,
[3:04:29.200 --> 3:04:31.200]  and we are live.
[3:04:31.200 --> 3:04:35.200]  We're going to talk about further fallout from the We Spar debacle,
[3:04:35.200 --> 3:04:37.200]  you saw the counter protest.
[3:04:37.200 --> 3:04:40.200]  Basically, Antifa thinking it was great optics to go
[3:04:40.200 --> 3:04:43.200]  and protest against reasonable ordinary people
[3:04:43.200 --> 3:04:46.200]  who don't want their children exposed to male genitalia
[3:04:46.200 --> 3:04:48.200]  in female areas of spars.
[3:04:48.200 --> 3:04:50.200]  Really good optics on their part.
[3:04:50.200 --> 3:04:53.200]  There's another update on that, which I'm going to get to later on.
[3:04:53.200 --> 3:04:57.200]  But of course, we still remain here in the United Kingdom
[3:04:57.200 --> 3:05:00.200]  under lockdown, and the psychocrats,
[3:05:00.200 --> 3:05:04.200]  the extremist psychocrats, the behavioral scientists
[3:05:04.200 --> 3:05:08.200]  who admitted using totalitarian, unethical,
[3:05:08.200 --> 3:05:12.200]  mind control methods to terrify the British public
[3:05:12.200 --> 3:05:14.200]  into total obedience and conformity.
[3:05:14.200 --> 3:05:17.200]  They even admitted that they went too far,
[3:05:17.200 --> 3:05:20.200]  and now everyone's literally petrified to walk into
[3:05:20.200 --> 3:05:23.200]  a subway station, walk into a shop,
[3:05:23.200 --> 3:05:25.200]  walk into an educational institution,
[3:05:25.200 --> 3:05:28.200]  a football match or any venue whatsoever,
[3:05:28.200 --> 3:05:31.200]  a pub or restaurant without wearing a mask,
[3:05:31.200 --> 3:05:35.200]  because they appear to have forgotten what Anthony Fauci said
[3:05:35.200 --> 3:05:38.200]  back in February 2020, which is that the virus particles
[3:05:38.200 --> 3:05:41.200]  are smaller than the holes in those masks.
[3:05:41.200 --> 3:05:44.200]  Doesn't really talk about that anymore, does he?
[3:05:44.200 --> 3:05:47.200]  So we had the announcement yesterday,
[3:05:47.200 --> 3:05:49.200]  and it was a provisional announcement.
[3:05:49.200 --> 3:05:53.200]  Let's make it clear that all restrictions in the United Kingdom
[3:05:53.200 --> 3:05:57.200]  would end on July the 19th, the social distancing,
[3:05:57.200 --> 3:06:00.200]  the mask mandates, it would all go out the window
[3:06:00.200 --> 3:06:03.200]  because apparently we're supposed to be graciously grateful
[3:06:03.200 --> 3:06:05.200]  to the government for giving us freedoms
[3:06:05.200 --> 3:06:07.200]  that it was never there.
[3:06:07.200 --> 3:06:10.200]  Remit to give us back in the first place.
[3:06:10.200 --> 3:06:13.200]  So everything's supposed to open back up on the 19th,
[3:06:13.200 --> 3:06:16.200]  and yet we have the psychocrats, the mind controllers,
[3:06:16.200 --> 3:06:18.200]  the behavioral psychologists,
[3:06:18.200 --> 3:06:21.200]  who admittedly weaponized behavioral psychology
[3:06:21.200 --> 3:06:24.200]  to terrify the British public into complete obedience,
[3:06:24.200 --> 3:06:29.200]  now desperately scrambling to get these measures back into place.
[3:06:29.200 --> 3:06:32.200]  Headline out of Summit.News,
[3:06:32.200 --> 3:06:35.200]  Communist Party lockdown zealot freaks out
[3:06:35.200 --> 3:06:38.200]  when asked about her political beliefs.
[3:06:38.200 --> 3:06:41.200]  This is somebody who we featured on the show before,
[3:06:41.200 --> 3:06:44.200]  Susan Michie, who is a lifetime member
[3:06:44.200 --> 3:06:48.200]  and still is to this day of the Communist Party.
[3:06:48.200 --> 3:06:50.200]  Now, correct me if I'm wrong,
[3:06:50.200 --> 3:06:53.200]  but I don't think that people who adhere to,
[3:06:53.200 --> 3:06:57.200]  promote and promulgate extremist political beliefs
[3:06:57.200 --> 3:07:01.200]  based around complete dictatorial state control
[3:07:01.200 --> 3:07:04.200]  and putting people who disagree in gulags,
[3:07:04.200 --> 3:07:07.200]  that's essentially the source of Communist belief,
[3:07:07.200 --> 3:07:09.200]  I don't think they should be advising the government,
[3:07:09.200 --> 3:07:12.200]  and yet they still are.
[3:07:12.200 --> 3:07:15.200]  So this Susan Michie appeared on a big show in Britain
[3:07:15.200 --> 3:07:19.200]  called Good Morning Britain yesterday morning,
[3:07:19.200 --> 3:07:22.200]  and for the first time since she's been appearing on television
[3:07:22.200 --> 3:07:25.200]  across the board for months and months and months,
[3:07:25.200 --> 3:07:29.200]  somebody asked her the question if her membership,
[3:07:29.200 --> 3:07:32.200]  her lifetime membership of the Communist Party,
[3:07:32.200 --> 3:07:36.200]  informed her beliefs on the fact that she wants perma lockdown.
[3:07:36.200 --> 3:07:40.200]  She was asked on a different show when mask mandates should end,
[3:07:40.200 --> 3:07:43.200]  and she literally said, never.
[3:07:43.200 --> 3:07:45.200]  In fact, she was asked,
[3:07:45.200 --> 3:07:48.200]  how long we should be wearing masks in her own words?
[3:07:48.200 --> 3:07:51.200]  She said, quote, forever.
[3:07:51.200 --> 3:07:54.200]  So despite Michie making innumerable appearances on television,
[3:07:54.200 --> 3:07:57.200]  not one single interviewer asked her about being a Communist,
[3:07:57.200 --> 3:07:59.200]  which is kind of interesting,
[3:07:59.200 --> 3:08:02.200]  because if somebody was literally exposed to be a neo-Nazi,
[3:08:02.200 --> 3:08:04.200]  and they were found to be a prominent influencer
[3:08:04.200 --> 3:08:09.200]  and advisor to the government on crucial matters of health policy,
[3:08:09.200 --> 3:08:11.200]  that would probably be a big deal.
[3:08:11.200 --> 3:08:14.200]  But not if you're a Communist, apparently, then it's completely fine.
[3:08:14.200 --> 3:08:19.200]  But she was asked about it by a TV host called Richard Maitley,
[3:08:19.200 --> 3:08:23.200]  and she basically squirmed for two minutes and said,
[3:08:23.200 --> 3:08:24.200]  how dare you?
[3:08:24.200 --> 3:08:28.200]  How dare you ask me about my extremist political belief?
[3:08:28.200 --> 3:08:30.200]  That's misogynistic.
[3:08:30.200 --> 3:08:33.200]  Her defenders literally came out on Twitter immediately afterwards
[3:08:33.200 --> 3:08:36.200]  and said that it was sexist and misogynistic to ask
[3:08:36.200 --> 3:08:39.200]  this wanted, sage, scientist a question.
[3:08:39.200 --> 3:08:41.200]  Whilst she should be questioned,
[3:08:41.200 --> 3:08:43.200]  because she's not even a medical scientist,
[3:08:43.200 --> 3:08:44.200]  she's not a virologist,
[3:08:44.200 --> 3:08:47.200]  she's a behavioral scientist.
[3:08:47.200 --> 3:08:49.200]  And as I write in the article,
[3:08:49.200 --> 3:08:52.200]  in other words, Michie was one of the individuals responsible
[3:08:52.200 --> 3:08:55.200]  for brainwashing the British public using, quote,
[3:08:55.200 --> 3:08:57.200]  mind control, their words, not mine,
[3:08:57.200 --> 3:09:00.200]  and the weaponization of behavioral psychology
[3:09:00.200 --> 3:09:03.200]  for the start of the pandemic to make everyone overly terrified
[3:09:03.200 --> 3:09:07.200]  of a virus that in reality has a relatively low fatality rate.
[3:09:07.200 --> 3:09:11.200]  So she was one of the individuals deliberately weaponizing
[3:09:11.200 --> 3:09:15.200]  psychological manipulation to scare and terrify the British public
[3:09:15.200 --> 3:09:17.200]  into complete submission.
[3:09:17.200 --> 3:09:20.200]  She's tweeted her support for the Chinese Communist government
[3:09:20.200 --> 3:09:24.200]  methods welding people in their own homes and things like that.
[3:09:24.200 --> 3:09:29.200]  So she was finally asked to justify her stance on permanent lockdown
[3:09:29.200 --> 3:09:33.200]  in comparison to her extremist communist political beliefs.
[3:09:33.200 --> 3:09:35.200]  She flailed, she scrambled,
[3:09:35.200 --> 3:09:38.200]  she was basically shown up for exactly what she was,
[3:09:38.200 --> 3:09:42.200]  and the mob on Twitter immediately leapt to her defense.
[3:09:42.200 --> 3:09:44.200]  We'll talk about it more on the other side.
[3:09:44.200 --> 3:09:45.200]  Summit.News.
[3:09:45.200 --> 3:10:10.200]  Don't go away.
[3:10:15.200 --> 3:10:41.200]  Don't go away.
[3:10:41.200 --> 3:11:08.200]  Don't go away.
[3:11:08.200 --> 3:11:34.200]  Don't go away.
[3:11:34.200 --> 3:12:00.200]  Don't go away.
[3:12:00.200 --> 3:12:09.200]  You're listening to the Summit.News Radio Hour with Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:12:09.200 --> 3:12:15.200]  So this cult of psychocrats, behavioral scientists are desperate
[3:12:15.200 --> 3:12:19.200]  for scrambling to maintain lockdown restrictions in the United Kingdom
[3:12:19.200 --> 3:12:23.200]  despite the government finally being pressured to the point where they're saying
[3:12:23.200 --> 3:12:26.200]  almost all of them are going to be lifted on July 19th
[3:12:26.200 --> 3:12:29.200]  or all across television, all across the media.
[3:12:29.200 --> 3:12:34.200]  Panicking that their cult may be about to come to an end.
[3:12:34.200 --> 3:12:37.200]  And one of them, one of the primary ones is Susan Mitchie,
[3:12:37.200 --> 3:12:39.200]  a lifetime member of the Communist Party.
[3:12:39.200 --> 3:12:44.200]  She was asked on Good Morning Britain by host Richard Maley, Maley Quote,
[3:12:44.200 --> 3:12:47.200]  you've been a member of the Communist Party for about 40 years now,
[3:12:47.200 --> 3:12:49.200]  you're still a member, and we know their status.
[3:12:49.200 --> 3:12:51.200]  We look at communist countries around the world
[3:12:51.200 --> 3:12:54.200]  and we see their tremendously top-down dominant and controlled societies
[3:12:54.200 --> 3:12:55.200]  that they rule over.
[3:12:55.200 --> 3:12:58.200]  I just wonder, and I'm putting this question on behalf of those
[3:12:58.200 --> 3:13:01.200]  who wonder about your politics, if your politics actually informs
[3:13:01.200 --> 3:13:04.200]  your sense of control, it's not just the medical arguments
[3:13:04.200 --> 3:13:09.200]  but you have a kind of political bent to want the state to tell people what to do.
[3:13:09.200 --> 3:13:14.200]  And how did she react to the first time ever that I've seen on British television,
[3:13:14.200 --> 3:13:21.200]  this government advisor to being questioned as to her extremist communist beliefs?
[3:13:21.200 --> 3:13:25.200]  Well, she flailed, she scrambled, she freaked out.
[3:13:25.200 --> 3:13:28.200]  She said, I've come on your program as a scientist,
[3:13:28.200 --> 3:13:30.200]  as do all the people who come on to your program as scientists,
[3:13:30.200 --> 3:13:35.200]  they come on to talk about the evidence, relevant theories, how we approach, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[3:13:35.200 --> 3:13:39.200]  He said in response, so you're saying your politics doesn't inform your opinion on this subject.
[3:13:39.200 --> 3:13:41.200]  Hmm, yeah, really.
[3:13:41.200 --> 3:13:44.200]  She said, I'm saying that I agreed to come on this program as a scientist, blah, blah, blah.
[3:13:44.200 --> 3:13:49.200]  So she continually bangs on about being a scientist, like she's a medical scientist.
[3:13:49.200 --> 3:13:53.200]  She's not a medical scientist, she's not a virologist,
[3:13:53.200 --> 3:13:56.200]  she's a behavioral scientist.
[3:13:56.200 --> 3:14:01.200]  And may I remind people that it came out and it was widely reported in the telegraph,
[3:14:01.200 --> 3:14:07.200]  and I linked to it in this article, that these behavioral scientists admitted being responsible
[3:14:07.200 --> 3:14:11.200]  for brainwashing the British public using, quote, mind control
[3:14:11.200 --> 3:14:15.200]  and the weaponization of behavioral psychology at the start of the pandemic
[3:14:15.200 --> 3:14:20.200]  to make everyone overly terrified of a virus that in reality has a relatively low fatality rate.
[3:14:20.200 --> 3:14:27.200]  That's why we saw polls in summer last year, even after the so-called first declining cases,
[3:14:27.200 --> 3:14:35.200]  where the average British citizen thought that coronavirus had killed 100 times more people than it actually had.
[3:14:35.200 --> 3:14:41.200]  And the reality of that is actually 100 times worse, because someone did a Freedom of Information Act request
[3:14:41.200 --> 3:14:45.200]  to the UK government, and this is on the UK government's own website,
[3:14:45.200 --> 3:14:51.200]  where they asked how many people had died of COVID, where COVID was the sole cause of death,
[3:14:51.200 --> 3:14:57.200]  with no co-morbidities, the true total was 10% of the actual total.
[3:14:57.200 --> 3:15:04.200]  So it was 10 times less than the official number that they've been telling us for the past 15 months.
[3:15:04.200 --> 3:15:07.200]  And that, of course, probably includes a bunch of flu cases.
[3:15:07.200 --> 3:15:12.200]  We've had top epidemiologists come out and say they're counting the flu cases as COVID cases
[3:15:12.200 --> 3:15:18.200]  to artificially inflate the numbers, and in fact, I'm going to have more on that later in the show.
[3:15:18.200 --> 3:15:23.200]  So Mrs. Michie, the communist Gulag advocate hardliner,
[3:15:23.200 --> 3:15:27.200]  completely freaked out of being questioned over her political beliefs,
[3:15:27.200 --> 3:15:31.200]  which clearly inform her advice to the government.
[3:15:31.200 --> 3:15:36.200]  She tweeted once, quote, China has a socialist collective system, whatever criticism people may have,
[3:15:36.200 --> 3:15:43.200]  yet welding people inside their own homes, crushing pro-democracy protests beneath the tracks of tanks
[3:15:43.200 --> 3:15:49.200]  at Tiananmen Square, such a wonderful system that you would openly espouse and advocate for,
[3:15:49.200 --> 3:15:52.200]  and you get into a position of advising the British government
[3:15:52.200 --> 3:15:57.200]  when you have these extremist anti-democracy beliefs.
[3:15:57.200 --> 3:15:59.200]  She freaked out.
[3:15:59.200 --> 3:16:02.200]  But Twitter, the Twitter mob, let to her defense,
[3:16:02.200 --> 3:16:07.200]  and they said that this TV host questioning her on being a lifetime member of the Communist Party
[3:16:07.200 --> 3:16:11.200]  to the point where she was literally called Stalinist nanny.
[3:16:11.200 --> 3:16:13.200]  She's that vehement.
[3:16:13.200 --> 3:16:17.200]  She's that much of a comrade, a true believer.
[3:16:17.200 --> 3:16:19.200]  Well, it was misogynistic.
[3:16:19.200 --> 3:16:23.200]  You can't challenge a female scientist, a vaunted scientist,
[3:16:23.200 --> 3:16:25.200]  even though she's not a proper scientist.
[3:16:25.200 --> 3:16:32.200]  And Deepty Gwadisani, good old British name, tweeted, please get boycott GMV trending.
[3:16:32.200 --> 3:16:38.200]  Yes, they wanted to boycott the whole show because this behavior towards women scientists is completely unacceptable.
[3:16:38.200 --> 3:16:39.200]  We shouldn't tolerate it.
[3:16:39.200 --> 3:16:44.200]  So because she has a vagina, you can't question her about being a lifetime gulag supporting
[3:16:44.200 --> 3:16:48.200]  round them all up and kill them, communist sympathizer and advocate.
[3:16:48.200 --> 3:16:51.200]  Because she's a woman and she has a vagina.
[3:16:51.200 --> 3:16:58.200]  They actually called the TV host Richard Maitley dangerous for merely asking this question.
[3:16:58.200 --> 3:17:03.200]  Someone else tweeted, by the way, given that she's a behavioral psychologist,
[3:17:03.200 --> 3:17:10.200]  not a proper scientist, a behavioral psychologist and manipulator of public opinion.
[3:17:10.200 --> 3:17:15.200]  Well, that's the first psychologist behavioral scientist I've heard not wanting to promote the notion of
[3:17:15.200 --> 3:17:19.200]  unconscious bias on the media for a very long time.
[3:17:19.200 --> 3:17:24.200]  Because of course, unconscious bias is a staple of behavioral psychology,
[3:17:24.200 --> 3:17:28.200]  but suddenly when she's challenged on her own unconscious bias,
[3:17:28.200 --> 3:17:34.200]  she freaks out and the Twitter mob leaps to her defense.
[3:17:34.200 --> 3:17:40.200]  Meanwhile, author Peter Hitchens has said that your grandkids will still be wearing masks in 2050.
[3:17:40.200 --> 3:17:42.200]  He tweeted, if people don't object to this now,
[3:17:42.200 --> 3:17:46.200]  their grandchildren will be wearing masks in the 2050s,
[3:17:46.200 --> 3:17:48.200]  although nobody will remember why.
[3:17:48.200 --> 3:17:52.200]  This was in response to companies like Ryanair and EasyJet,
[3:17:52.200 --> 3:17:56.200]  airliners and other businesses saying that they're just going to ignore the government ruling
[3:17:56.200 --> 3:17:59.200]  that all the restrictions are going to be lifted on masks
[3:17:59.200 --> 3:18:01.200]  and they're just going to make their own rules.
[3:18:01.200 --> 3:18:05.200]  So, de facto lockdown restrictions will continue forever
[3:18:05.200 --> 3:18:09.200]  if you're getting on a plane, if you're going in a pub or a restaurant
[3:18:09.200 --> 3:18:11.200]  which wants to impose their own rules,
[3:18:11.200 --> 3:18:14.200]  if you're going into a shop, an educational institution.
[3:18:14.200 --> 3:18:20.200]  Because they're not, they're suddenly, after 15 months of following the government advice to a tee,
[3:18:20.200 --> 3:18:25.200]  as soon as the government says you don't have to wear a mask in any of these public places
[3:18:25.200 --> 3:18:29.200]  or on airlines, oh well, suddenly now they're the experts
[3:18:29.200 --> 3:18:31.200]  and they're going to make the rules.
[3:18:31.200 --> 3:18:35.200]  So it's never going to end and it's never going to end
[3:18:35.200 --> 3:18:38.200]  because they're going to keep finding new variants,
[3:18:38.200 --> 3:18:44.200]  eustereants, lockdown skeptics reports, restrictions could be reintroduced locally
[3:18:44.200 --> 3:18:48.200]  after Freedom Data deal with new variants, says Sajid Javid,
[3:18:48.200 --> 3:18:52.200]  the new health secretary of the UK, supposedly anti-lockdown
[3:18:52.200 --> 3:18:58.200]  and yet he's already saying regional lockdown restrictions will be reintroduced in the winter.
[3:18:58.200 --> 3:19:02.200]  You're going to have a flu season where people's natural immunity has been lowered
[3:19:02.200 --> 3:19:04.200]  because they've been locked inside their houses
[3:19:04.200 --> 3:19:07.200]  or refused to come out for the past 15 months.
[3:19:07.200 --> 3:19:10.200]  So you're going to probably have a quite vicious flu season,
[3:19:10.200 --> 3:19:13.200]  we've had that every year in the past and we didn't need to wear masks,
[3:19:13.200 --> 3:19:16.200]  the hospitals were not overcrowded, we coped with it,
[3:19:16.200 --> 3:19:20.200]  but suddenly now we don't have functioning immune systems as human beings,
[3:19:20.200 --> 3:19:25.200]  so we're going to have to lock down again in winter because of new variants
[3:19:25.200 --> 3:19:28.200]  and lo and behold, they've already found one.
[3:19:28.200 --> 3:19:35.200]  Zero hedge reports, lambda variants and usual mutations make it resistant to vaccines,
[3:19:35.200 --> 3:19:39.200]  oh no, you're going to have to get another vaccine
[3:19:39.200 --> 3:19:41.200]  and if you don't, well you're not going to be able to fly,
[3:19:41.200 --> 3:19:45.200]  go into a pub, a restaurant, sporting event, a music venue,
[3:19:45.200 --> 3:19:49.200]  two tier society, the haves and the have nots.
[3:19:49.200 --> 3:19:56.200]  The lambarda variant, also known as C37 is believed to have first emerged in Peru in August last year,
[3:19:56.200 --> 3:19:59.200]  has only been recognized as a potential global threat in recent weeks
[3:19:59.200 --> 3:20:03.200]  with the World Health Organization declaring it a variant of interest,
[3:20:03.200 --> 3:20:09.200]  very interesting, after it appeared in several countries simultaneously.
[3:20:09.200 --> 3:20:13.200]  The who said the variants neutralizing antibodies could increase its transmissibility
[3:20:13.200 --> 3:20:17.200]  or potentially increase its resistance, so basically saying,
[3:20:17.200 --> 3:20:20.200]  they're basically saying that the vaccines won't work,
[3:20:20.200 --> 3:20:26.200]  they'll have a period of scaremongering for a few months where we have to lock down yet again
[3:20:26.200 --> 3:20:29.200]  and then they'll come out with a new vaccine that covers this variant,
[3:20:29.200 --> 3:20:34.200]  the people who don't get it won't be able to live their lives or do anything socially or lifestyle-wise whatsoever,
[3:20:34.200 --> 3:20:38.200]  they'll be the have nots, people will get the vaccine, they'll be fine
[3:20:38.200 --> 3:20:42.200]  and then we'll unlock for two weeks, then there'll be another variant
[3:20:42.200 --> 3:21:00.200]  and we'll have to lock down again, it never ends, don't go away.
[3:21:13.200 --> 3:21:17.200]  And they've harassed and almost shut down everybody else, they crippled all the other groups
[3:21:17.200 --> 3:21:21.200]  and we're still here and as this whole new world order comes out and be open,
[3:21:21.200 --> 3:21:24.200]  our credibility's showing up, that's why we've got to be taken off air,
[3:21:24.200 --> 3:21:28.200]  that's why America has got to be taken down, you can't have all these other nations enslaved
[3:21:28.200 --> 3:21:32.200]  and America's still quasi-free, you can't have Info Wars has been proven right,
[3:21:32.200 --> 3:21:35.200]  being on air with all the craziness that's about to unfold,
[3:21:35.200 --> 3:21:39.200]  because if you think stuff's bad now, just get ready, so thank you all

[3:25:01.200 --> 3:25:12.200]  Live from London, England, it's Paul Joseph Watson with Summit.News.
[3:25:12.200 --> 3:25:16.200]  We're going to throw to this video now because Morrissey, pot icon Morrissey,
[3:25:16.200 --> 3:25:19.200]  who will never bow to the collectivist woke mob,
[3:25:19.200 --> 3:25:23.200]  is about to release a new album called Bonfire of Teenagers,
[3:25:23.200 --> 3:25:27.200]  the title track of which is about the Manchester Arena bombing
[3:25:27.200 --> 3:25:31.200]  and he did an interview on his official website which has caused waves today
[3:25:31.200 --> 3:25:34.200]  and the pitchfork mob are all out attacking him once again
[3:25:34.200 --> 3:25:37.200]  because God forbid he can actually think for himself.
[3:25:37.200 --> 3:25:43.200]  He's got a new album out and he's done a new interview about lockdown being akin to slavery.
[3:25:43.200 --> 3:25:45.200]  We're going to go to this video now and I'll come back
[3:25:45.200 --> 3:25:49.200]  and talk about some of the fallout from this interview on the other side.
[3:25:49.200 --> 3:25:51.200]  Here is the clip.
[3:25:51.200 --> 3:25:59.200]  Music icon Morrissey is back to enrage the bedwetting mob with a new authentically anti-establishment album
[3:25:59.200 --> 3:26:04.200]  and a stinging rebuke of the UK's relentless COVID-19 lockdown.
[3:26:04.200 --> 3:26:07.200]  In an interview published on his Morrissey Central website,
[3:26:07.200 --> 3:26:12.200]  the former Smith's frontman ripped into how coronavirus rules and restrictions
[3:26:12.200 --> 3:26:16.200]  have been weaponised to widen the gap between us and them.
[3:26:16.200 --> 3:26:23.200]  The interviewer put it to Morrissey that, quote, COVID society is also the precise description of slavery.
[3:26:23.200 --> 3:26:26.200]  Yeah, we are supposed to be in a time when anything connected to slavery
[3:26:26.200 --> 3:26:29.200]  must be blown up or thrown in a canal in Bristol.
[3:26:29.200 --> 3:26:33.200]  Precisely responded Morrissey and more people are now forced into poverty
[3:26:33.200 --> 3:26:37.200]  which is another form of slavery as is tax and council tax
[3:26:37.200 --> 3:26:40.200]  and all the other ways in which we are pinned down and tracked.
[3:26:40.200 --> 3:26:43.200]  Our present freedom is restricted to visiting supermarkets
[3:26:43.200 --> 3:26:47.200]  and buying sofas. The government act like Chinese emperors.
[3:26:47.200 --> 3:26:51.200]  We will allow you to live as we do if you behave yourself.
[3:26:51.200 --> 3:26:58.200]  Morrissey pointed out that the elite aren't subject to the same COVID rules that they impose on everyone else.
[3:26:58.200 --> 3:27:03.200]  He said the country isn't really in lockdown except for people at the lower end of the social ladder.
[3:27:03.200 --> 3:27:07.200]  People who have wealth are not remotely affected by rules and regulations.
[3:27:07.200 --> 3:27:10.200]  Their lives are as they always were.
[3:27:10.200 --> 3:27:14.200]  Police only find people who live on council estates, haven't you noticed?
[3:27:14.200 --> 3:27:19.200]  Far from the projection of the collectivist myth that we're all in this together.
[3:27:19.200 --> 3:27:25.200]  The kind of fake performative charade embodied by the weekly clap for the NHS
[3:27:25.200 --> 3:27:28.200]  or cringe celebrity charity bunraisers.
[3:27:28.200 --> 3:27:35.200]  Morrissey points out that in reality the lockdown has made people more atomised than ever before.
[3:27:35.200 --> 3:27:39.200]  It has brought the worst out in people and we weren't ever in this together.
[3:27:39.200 --> 3:27:42.200]  We are deprived of seeing and hearing other people and above all,
[3:27:42.200 --> 3:27:45.200]  you want to be with others who see and hear what you see and hear
[3:27:45.200 --> 3:27:49.200]  because this is basic oxygen for the human soul.
[3:27:49.200 --> 3:27:52.200]  Take it away and people are dead.
[3:27:52.200 --> 3:27:57.200]  What defines England's new contrived collectivised patriotic identity?
[3:27:57.200 --> 3:28:02.200]  It's firmly based around people worshipping dysfunctional organs of the state
[3:28:02.200 --> 3:28:07.200]  while hiding their actual identity behind state-mandated cloth and elastic.
[3:28:07.200 --> 3:28:12.200]  Any native semblance of true English identity has long been overpowered
[3:28:12.200 --> 3:28:15.200]  by the all-consuming strength of diversity.
[3:28:15.200 --> 3:28:20.200]  The kind of diversity that led to the hashtag refugees welcome campaign
[3:28:20.200 --> 3:28:26.200]  and the British government graciously rescuing refugees Salman Abadi from war-torn Libya.
[3:28:26.200 --> 3:28:32.200]  Abadi went on to show his gratitude by blowing himself up at an Ariana Grande concert
[3:28:32.200 --> 3:28:37.200]  killing 22 people and injuring 800, many of them children.
[3:28:37.200 --> 3:28:40.200]  Concerned concert-goers and flustered security guards
[3:28:40.200 --> 3:28:44.200]  wanted to report Abadi's suspicious behaviour to higher-ups
[3:28:44.200 --> 3:28:48.200]  that they were either ignored or refrained from choosing to report him at all
[3:28:48.200 --> 3:28:51.200]  for fear of being branded racist.
[3:28:51.200 --> 3:28:53.200]  But as we've been told many times before,
[3:28:53.200 --> 3:28:56.200]  political correctness is just being nice to people.
[3:28:56.200 --> 3:29:00.200]  Diversity necessitates the dissolving of borders
[3:29:00.200 --> 3:29:04.200]  unless those borders are concrete bollards on bridges.
[3:29:04.200 --> 3:29:07.200]  Morrissey mentions another case of diversity gone wrong.
[3:29:07.200 --> 3:29:12.200]  Emily Jones, the 7-year-old girl from Bolton who had her throat slit
[3:29:12.200 --> 3:29:15.200]  while cycling through the park on Mother's Day last year.
[3:29:15.200 --> 3:29:19.200]  The culprit was an Albanian woman smuggled into the UK on a lorry
[3:29:19.200 --> 3:29:21.200]  and later given asylum by the government
[3:29:21.200 --> 3:29:24.200]  despite lying about being a victim of human trafficking.
[3:29:24.200 --> 3:29:27.200]  Despite admitting that the killing of Emily Jones was, quote,
[3:29:27.200 --> 3:29:32.200]  premeditated, 30-year-old Eltonia Skarner escaped a murder charge
[3:29:32.200 --> 3:29:35.200]  because her defence team successfully claimed
[3:29:35.200 --> 3:29:38.200]  she'd just forgotten to take her meds that day.
[3:29:38.200 --> 3:29:42.200]  The Manchester Arena bombing is the subject of the title track
[3:29:42.200 --> 3:29:45.200]  of Morrissey's new album, Bonfire of Teenagers.
[3:29:45.200 --> 3:29:47.200]  Doesn't mince words, does he?
[3:29:47.200 --> 3:29:49.200]  Bonfire of Teenagers, the track is magnificent,
[3:29:49.200 --> 3:29:52.200]  but you must be expecting some manufactured paranoia.
[3:29:52.200 --> 3:29:57.200]  The usual, you can't sing about that, Pearl Thumbler's Morrissey was asked.
[3:29:57.200 --> 3:29:58.200]  He responded, quote,
[3:29:58.200 --> 3:30:00.200]  It's about the kids who were murdered, yes.
[3:30:00.200 --> 3:30:04.200]  We're not encouraged to look beneath the surface because it's dark and hidden,
[3:30:04.200 --> 3:30:06.200]  but the song is anti-terror
[3:30:06.200 --> 3:30:11.200]  and anyone who finds that offensive can only be devoid of personal morality.
[3:30:11.200 --> 3:30:12.200]  As your brother once said to me,
[3:30:12.200 --> 3:30:15.200]  the Manchester Arena bombing was Britain's 9-11.
[3:30:15.200 --> 3:30:18.200]  We should appreciate anyone who asks questions.
[3:30:18.200 --> 3:30:22.200]  Except the music industry doesn't appreciate artists who question anything.
[3:30:22.200 --> 3:30:24.200]  The music industry doesn't like mavericks.
[3:30:24.200 --> 3:30:25.200]  They don't like that.
[3:30:25.200 --> 3:30:27.200]  They like people like Harry Styles.
[3:30:27.200 --> 3:30:30.200]  They say, where this dress has shut it?
[3:30:30.200 --> 3:30:31.200]  Where this?
[3:30:31.200 --> 3:30:33.200]  I sing that and go home.
[3:30:33.200 --> 3:30:38.200]  That's why the whole industry is one huge, insipid, sanctimonious circle jerk.
[3:30:38.200 --> 3:30:41.200]  Well, success isn't judged on authenticity or talent,
[3:30:41.200 --> 3:30:43.200]  but on who is the best at amplifying
[3:30:43.200 --> 3:30:48.200]  glib, consensus, establishment-approved cultural and political narratives.
[3:30:48.200 --> 3:30:51.200]  The very industry that can only remain true to itself
[3:30:51.200 --> 3:30:55.200]  by encouraging unchained, open expression
[3:30:55.200 --> 3:30:59.200]  now creates the conditions for the very polar opposite.
[3:30:59.200 --> 3:31:00.200]  And that's why Morrissey,
[3:31:00.200 --> 3:31:03.200]  despite maintaining a substantial, loyal core fanbase,
[3:31:03.200 --> 3:31:06.200]  was unceremoniously dropped by his record label
[3:31:06.200 --> 3:31:09.200]  for committing the unforgivable sin
[3:31:09.200 --> 3:31:12.200]  of saying diversity isn't a strength.
[3:31:12.200 --> 3:31:15.200]  Sony Corporation-owned BMG responded by saying
[3:31:15.200 --> 3:31:19.200]  the decision to cancel Morrissey was based on their quote,
[3:31:19.200 --> 3:31:21.200]  new plans for diversity.
[3:31:21.200 --> 3:31:25.200]  Plans that didn't include mozza, a middle-aged white man.
[3:31:25.200 --> 3:31:26.200]  Not diverse enough.
[3:31:26.200 --> 3:31:30.200]  The world's oldest record store also banned sales of his work altogether.
[3:31:30.200 --> 3:31:32.200]  A rail company removed all posters
[3:31:32.200 --> 3:31:37.200]  promoting his work after a single customer complained that they were offended.
[3:31:37.200 --> 3:31:39.200]  But as Morrissey himself explains,
[3:31:39.200 --> 3:31:41.200]  despite the mob's ceaseless pearl clutching,
[3:31:41.200 --> 3:31:45.200]  he's been canceled by the mainstream a million times already.
[3:31:45.200 --> 3:31:47.200]  You can't cancel someone who has always been canceled.
[3:31:47.200 --> 3:31:50.200]  When did you last see me on television or hear me on the radio?
[3:31:50.200 --> 3:31:53.200]  I unintentionally invented the condition of being canceled.
[3:31:53.200 --> 3:31:56.200]  The music industry hasn't ever celebrated me or offered me free food.
[3:31:56.200 --> 3:32:00.200]  I've always been treated like a scientific experiment gone wrong.
[3:32:00.200 --> 3:32:01.200]  I'm used to it.
[3:32:01.200 --> 3:32:04.200]  I've been immune to enemy fire for many years.
[3:32:04.200 --> 3:32:06.200]  I wear a bulletproof vest in the bath.
[3:32:06.200 --> 3:32:09.200]  It seems to me that as soon as one person booze,
[3:32:09.200 --> 3:32:13.200]  they all start to boo, and then when someone cheers, they all start to cheer.
[3:32:13.200 --> 3:32:14.200]  But that's just a loose theory.
[3:32:14.200 --> 3:32:17.200]  According to Morrissey himself and others who've heard the album,
[3:32:17.200 --> 3:32:22.200]  bonfire of teenagers is his best solo work to date.
[3:32:22.200 --> 3:32:26.200]  So prepare for another onslaught of one-star reviews from music journalists.
[3:32:26.200 --> 3:32:29.200]  Intellectual cowards who know they'd soon be out of a career
[3:32:29.200 --> 3:32:32.200]  if they dared provoke the baying mob
[3:32:32.200 --> 3:32:35.200]  by doing so much as giving Morrissey a fair crack of the whip.
[3:32:35.200 --> 3:32:40.200]  Because apparently in the music industry, the only form of diversity that isn't a strength
[3:32:40.200 --> 3:32:43.200]  is diversity of thought.
[3:32:46.200 --> 3:32:49.200]  There you have it. Morrissey versus the conformist mob.
[3:32:49.200 --> 3:32:52.200]  Most people don't realize that Morrissey's been making comments like this.
[3:32:52.200 --> 3:32:56.200]  Since at least 2008, even before that, in fact, even in the 90s,
[3:32:56.200 --> 3:33:02.200]  the music press freaked out about him covering himself with a British flag on stage
[3:33:02.200 --> 3:33:06.200]  during live performances. Oh, my God, how dare he?
[3:33:06.200 --> 3:33:09.200]  And we see the mob coming after him once again today.
[3:33:09.200 --> 3:33:11.200]  All the headlines came out.
[3:33:11.200 --> 3:33:13.200]  That interview came out on his website last night today.
[3:33:13.200 --> 3:33:14.200]  They're all freaking out.
[3:33:14.200 --> 3:33:18.200]  He's trending on Twitter because, again, he dared challenge
[3:33:18.200 --> 3:33:22.200]  this weird, slavish devotion to lockdown restrictions
[3:33:22.200 --> 3:33:24.200]  embodied, embraced by the left in Britain.
[3:33:24.200 --> 3:33:27.200]  Despite the fact that all of those restrictions have been imposed
[3:33:27.200 --> 3:33:33.200]  by the same Tory government, the same right-wing populist draconian Tory government
[3:33:33.200 --> 3:33:37.200]  that they supposedly hate, as soon as they start talking about lifting those restrictions,
[3:33:37.200 --> 3:33:43.200]  then, oh, my God, the fear, returns, and Morrissey calling lockdown restrictions out
[3:33:43.200 --> 3:33:46.200]  for what they are cannot be tolerated.
[3:33:46.200 --> 3:33:50.200]  He's trending on Twitter today, at least in the UK, along with Johnny Maher,
[3:33:50.200 --> 3:33:52.200]  the guitarist out in the Smiths.
[3:33:52.200 --> 3:33:56.200]  And they're all saying, oh, well, surely Johnny Maher was the talented one
[3:33:56.200 --> 3:33:58.200]  in the Smiths all along?
[3:33:58.200 --> 3:34:02.200]  Well, no, you think that because Johnny Maher agrees with all your dopey,
[3:34:02.200 --> 3:34:06.200]  middle-class, metropolitan, NPC-conformist political opinions.
[3:34:06.200 --> 3:34:08.200]  It's not judged on talent.
[3:34:08.200 --> 3:34:12.200]  It's judged on the fact that he caved and conformed to the mob.
[3:34:12.200 --> 3:34:14.200]  That's why you like Johnny Maher.
[3:34:14.200 --> 3:34:18.200]  If you do an actual comparison of the relative success of Morrissey
[3:34:18.200 --> 3:34:22.200]  compared to Johnny Maher after the Smiths broke up in the 80s,
[3:34:22.200 --> 3:34:28.200]  Johnny Maher hasn't had 13 top 10 albums in the UK since the Smiths split up.
[3:34:28.200 --> 3:34:32.200]  Somebody else has, and his name is Morrissey.
[3:34:32.200 --> 3:34:35.200]  You can't cancel Morrissey. He's a total legend. He's based.
[3:34:35.200 --> 3:34:40.200]  He has been for 20-plus years, and he remains so to this day.
[3:34:40.200 --> 3:34:43.200]  Don't go away. We'll be right back. This is Summit.News.
[3:34:43.200 --> 3:34:46.200]  Don't go away. More news coming up after the break.

[3:36:07.200 --> 3:36:11.200]  The truth is, they've had to come out the open to attack human freedom
[3:36:11.200 --> 3:36:13.200]  because they're actually losing.
[3:36:13.200 --> 3:36:16.200]  We have forced them out in the open.
[3:36:16.200 --> 3:36:20.200]  So as bad as these times are, and a lot of negative things are about to happen,
[3:36:20.200 --> 3:36:22.200]  realize humanity is winning.
[3:36:22.200 --> 3:36:27.200]  You've got to trust in the plan of God, and trust in the plan of God's justice.
[3:36:27.200 --> 3:36:32.200]  That is invincible. That is ethereal, timeless, and unstoppable.
[3:36:32.200 --> 3:36:36.200]  So don't trust in man, trust in God, to lead God and direct your soul,
[3:36:36.200 --> 3:36:38.200]  and to take action against the globalists.
[3:36:38.200 --> 3:36:42.200]  And realize, you've got my commitment from Alex Jones and my crew to you.
[3:36:42.200 --> 3:36:47.200]  We will never back down from the globalists, and we will never surrender.
[3:36:47.200 --> 3:36:51.200]  I am a very humble person, but I'm also a bold person.
[3:36:51.200 --> 3:36:54.200]  And so, as bad as things are with the globalists attacking humanity,
[3:36:54.200 --> 3:36:56.200]  with all the terrible things that are unfolding,
[3:36:56.200 --> 3:37:00.200]  I want you to know that a lot of positive things are happening as well.
[3:37:00.200 --> 3:37:04.200]  I'm a public figure, so I get to see things the general public doesn't get to see.
[3:37:04.200 --> 3:37:08.200]  And let me tell you, whether it's police chiefs or members of Congress,
[3:37:08.200 --> 3:37:12.200]  or even folks in Hollywood, or mainstream media, or industry,
[3:37:12.200 --> 3:37:16.200]  people are really, really away from the establishment.
[3:37:16.200 --> 3:37:18.200]  They don't want to go along with the globalists,
[3:37:18.200 --> 3:37:21.200]  but they're scared, they're looking for leadership.
[3:37:21.200 --> 3:37:23.200]  Well, that's where M4 comes in.
[3:37:23.200 --> 3:37:27.200]  You fund us, you support M4SWORD.com, you get great products at the same time.
[3:37:27.200 --> 3:37:31.200]  We will then go out and do what the globalists say is unpopular,
[3:37:31.200 --> 3:37:36.200]  what the globalists will target you for, to show people that it's safe to tell the truth,
[3:37:36.200 --> 3:37:38.200]  and to take the heat. That's our job.
[3:37:38.200 --> 3:37:42.200]  So please, keep us on air, so we can hit the bar wire,
[3:37:42.200 --> 3:37:45.200]  so we can meet the shock groups in the information war.
[3:37:45.200 --> 3:37:47.200]  Fund us at M4SWORD.com.
[3:37:47.200 --> 3:37:51.200]  Well, all the big box stores are making record profits,
[3:37:51.200 --> 3:37:55.200]  so is Amazon, because they designed the global shutdown
[3:37:55.200 --> 3:37:58.200]  to destroy small and medium-sized businesses.
[3:37:58.200 --> 3:38:02.200]  And it is leaking havoc in the supply chain.
[3:38:02.200 --> 3:38:07.200]  Thousands and thousands of small companies have completely shut down,
[3:38:07.200 --> 3:38:12.200]  and others are struggling to stay open because they can't get raw materials,
[3:38:12.200 --> 3:38:15.200]  whether it's for food, whether it's for medicine, whether it's for supplements,
[3:38:15.200 --> 3:38:19.200]  whether it's for textiles, whatever the product is, you see it in the news.
[3:38:19.200 --> 3:38:22.200]  It is record-level supply chain breakdowns,
[3:38:22.200 --> 3:38:25.200]  because the globalists shut down the world economy for more than a year,
[3:38:25.200 --> 3:38:28.200]  and now they're trying to bring the shutdown back again.
[3:38:28.200 --> 3:38:32.200]  In fact, in areas like India and areas of Africa, the shutdown is ongoing.
[3:38:32.200 --> 3:38:35.200]  It's killing those people in massive numbers.
[3:38:35.200 --> 3:38:40.200]  So M4SWORD doesn't have a lot of our best-selling products anymore for six, seven, eight months.
[3:38:40.200 --> 3:38:45.200]  Because of this, so to make up the shortfall, please buy T-shirts, books, films, things like that
[3:38:45.200 --> 3:38:55.200]  at M4SWORD.com, and please try to keep us on the air.
[3:39:16.200 --> 3:39:19.200]  I've got another update on the Battle of Whispar.
[3:39:19.200 --> 3:39:22.200]  Of course, we had the Antifa counter protesters.
[3:39:22.200 --> 3:39:27.200]  The self-proclaimed anti-fascists who think anti-fascism is dealing out street beatings
[3:39:27.200 --> 3:39:32.200]  to fight people who don't want their daughters exposed to male genitalia,
[3:39:32.200 --> 3:39:36.200]  because they're so righteous, they're so morally upstanding in their cause.
[3:39:36.200 --> 3:39:38.200]  That's literally what they stand for now.
[3:39:38.200 --> 3:39:43.200]  But there's another update on this story, which I'm going to get into after this video.
[3:39:43.200 --> 3:39:47.200]  But here is the video first. This is the Battle of Whispar.
[3:39:47.200 --> 3:39:49.200]  Let's roll the video.
[3:39:53.200 --> 3:39:57.200]  When it comes to moral degradation and its global epicenter,
[3:39:57.200 --> 3:40:02.200]  the degenerate trash city of Los Angeles, nothing surprises me anymore.
[3:40:02.200 --> 3:40:06.200]  But this Whispar farce has plumbed new debts of debasement.
[3:40:06.200 --> 3:40:11.200]  A video that went viral on Twitter showed a customer at Whispar complaining about a man
[3:40:11.200 --> 3:40:16.200]  exposing his genitals to women and little girls in the female area of the spa.
[3:40:16.200 --> 3:40:21.200]  The staff at Whispar responded by defending the individual's right to do this,
[3:40:21.200 --> 3:40:25.200]  claiming it was an expression of his sexual orientation.
[3:40:27.200 --> 3:40:28.200]  Yeah, really.
[3:40:28.200 --> 3:40:32.200]  Then the CEO of a trans lobby group, who was interviewed by CBS Los Angeles,
[3:40:32.200 --> 3:40:35.200]  said the woman who complained was, quote, horrible,
[3:40:35.200 --> 3:40:40.200]  and had practiced, quote, violence against the individual who had flashed his genitals.
[3:40:40.200 --> 3:40:45.200]  And it's highly likely that the same individual was the subject of a 2018 complaint
[3:40:45.200 --> 3:40:50.200]  from a different woman who wrote about a naked man in the female shower section
[3:40:50.200 --> 3:40:53.200]  bragging about how many women he'd slept with.
[3:40:53.200 --> 3:40:57.200]  Los Angeles Magazine then highlighted a report from another spa in the city
[3:40:57.200 --> 3:40:59.200]  where a similar incident occurred.
[3:40:59.200 --> 3:41:03.200]  A rep for Century Day and Night Spa on Olympic Boulevard recalls a similar situation
[3:41:03.200 --> 3:41:07.200]  just weeks before the pandemic shut them down in spring 2020,
[3:41:07.200 --> 3:41:12.200]  in which a trans woman with everything reflected female on a driver's license
[3:41:12.200 --> 3:41:17.200]  caused an uproar among cisgender female clients by exposing male genitals
[3:41:17.200 --> 3:41:19.200]  in the female pools and lockers.
[3:41:19.200 --> 3:41:21.200]  She wouldn't really use the spas.
[3:41:21.200 --> 3:41:26.200]  She just sat at the corner of the pool with her feet in the water and her legs spread
[3:41:26.200 --> 3:41:30.200]  or took front-facing showers, the rep recalls.
[3:41:30.200 --> 3:41:31.200]  People began to feel uncomfortable.
[3:41:31.200 --> 3:41:33.200]  It became very disruptive.
[3:41:33.200 --> 3:41:35.200]  When the spa finally confronted her,
[3:41:35.200 --> 3:41:39.200]  it became evident that the spa should attempt to normalize young girls and women
[3:41:39.200 --> 3:41:41.200]  viewing male genitalia.
[3:41:41.200 --> 3:41:46.200]  And today we learned about another incident at We Spar that occurred in January 2020
[3:41:46.200 --> 3:41:53.200]  where a person with a beard and a penis got into a hot tub naked with a woman's six-year-old daughter.
[3:41:53.200 --> 3:41:58.200]  So to be clear, these individuals aren't just trans people minding their own business.
[3:41:58.200 --> 3:42:01.200]  They're perverts in the women's section,
[3:42:01.200 --> 3:42:06.200]  they're really provoking people and deliberately exposing themselves to kids
[3:42:06.200 --> 3:42:10.200]  and getting away with it by hiding behind the false claim of trans identity.
[3:42:10.200 --> 3:42:16.200]  So dangerous bigots who oppose the idea of children being exposed to male genitalia
[3:42:16.200 --> 3:42:20.200]  responded by organizing a protest outside We Spar on Saturday.
[3:42:20.200 --> 3:42:23.200]  And guess who showed up to counter-protest?
[3:42:23.200 --> 3:42:24.200]  Antifa.
[3:42:24.200 --> 3:42:26.200]  Of course it was Antifa.
[3:42:26.200 --> 3:42:29.200]  What's this? What's this?
[3:42:29.200 --> 3:42:33.200]  Because apparently anti-fascism now includes the open endorsement
[3:42:33.200 --> 3:42:37.200]  of the right of suspected nonces to show their meat and two veg to kids.
[3:42:37.200 --> 3:42:41.200]  What kind of demented idiot would think it would be good optics
[3:42:41.200 --> 3:42:45.200]  to show up and counter-protest and violently attack people
[3:42:45.200 --> 3:42:48.200]  who want to protect kids from perverts?
[3:42:48.200 --> 3:42:50.200]  I'm getting the word.
[3:42:53.200 --> 3:42:54.200]  Nuts.
[3:42:54.200 --> 3:42:59.200]  Remember back in 2017 when Antifa members were photographed carrying a sign
[3:42:59.200 --> 3:43:01.200]  that said no pedo bashing?
[3:43:01.200 --> 3:43:04.200]  Remember how the media claimed it was all staged?
[3:43:04.200 --> 3:43:07.200]  Oh Antifa would never support pedophilia.
[3:43:07.200 --> 3:43:08.200]  Really?
[3:43:08.200 --> 3:43:12.200]  Well you might want to reassess that claim after what happened on Saturday.
[3:43:12.200 --> 3:43:15.200]  People who showed up to assert that kids shouldn't be exposed to testicles
[3:43:15.200 --> 3:43:18.200]  were viciously attacked by Antifa thugs.
[3:43:18.200 --> 3:43:21.200]  The mob surrounded and hit a woman with a skateboard.
[3:43:21.200 --> 3:43:23.200]  A street preacher was thrown to the ground and beaten.
[3:43:23.200 --> 3:43:26.200]  Another Christian preacher had his face split open.
[3:43:26.200 --> 3:43:29.200]  Another woman had her arm cut open with a knife.
[3:43:29.200 --> 3:43:31.200]  The mob assaulted a videographer.
[3:43:31.200 --> 3:43:34.200]  Another video journalist was assaulted with a club.
[3:43:34.200 --> 3:43:37.200]  A Hispanic couple were surrounded and had their signs ripped away.
[3:43:37.200 --> 3:43:41.200]  When a Latino man defended himself against the mob, police arrested him.
[3:43:41.200 --> 3:43:45.200]  They also tried to attack an Asian man wearing a rooftop Korean t-shirt.
[3:43:45.200 --> 3:43:48.200]  Others were also harassed and hounded by the mob.
[3:43:48.200 --> 3:43:53.200]  And again, for what? Protecting the right of children not to be exposed in public
[3:43:53.200 --> 3:43:55.200]  to male genitalia.
[3:43:55.200 --> 3:44:00.200]  It's no surprise to me that Antifa has firmly planted its flag in Camp Nantes.
[3:44:00.200 --> 3:44:04.200]  We've highlighted innumerable examples where prominent Antifa activists
[3:44:04.200 --> 3:44:07.200]  have turned out to be pedos and sex offenders.
[3:44:07.200 --> 3:44:11.200]  Their movement is just so righteously virtuous and morally upstanding
[3:44:11.200 --> 3:44:14.200]  it just tends to attract those kind of people.
[3:44:14.200 --> 3:44:18.200]  They also previously attacked an anti-pedophilia event in Ireland.
[3:44:18.200 --> 3:44:22.200]  Are we the baddies?
[3:44:22.200 --> 3:44:27.200]  Let's not forget, the media is so beholden to defending Antifa
[3:44:27.200 --> 3:44:30.200]  and apologising for their rampant violent criminality
[3:44:30.200 --> 3:44:35.200]  that they go so far as to claim that the entire movement doesn't exist.
[3:44:35.200 --> 3:44:38.200]  Remember, this is the same media that puts Antifa on a par
[3:44:38.200 --> 3:44:41.200]  with the Allied troops who stormed Normandy.
[3:44:41.200 --> 3:44:45.200]  Running towards machine gun fire over mine-riddled beaches
[3:44:45.200 --> 3:44:47.200]  to fight Hitler's fascist war machine
[3:44:47.200 --> 3:44:50.200]  versus beating up a bunch of people who don't want their little girls
[3:44:50.200 --> 3:44:53.200]  to see some bloke's schlong in the shower.
[3:44:53.200 --> 3:44:55.200]  One of these things is not like the others.
[3:44:55.200 --> 3:44:59.200]  Let it forever be recorded in history that Antifa supports the right
[3:44:59.200 --> 3:45:03.200]  of biological males to show their genitalia to children.
[3:45:03.200 --> 3:45:06.200]  That's what they stand for. That's who they are.
[3:45:06.200 --> 3:45:10.200]  So when it comes to a historical judgement on who was on the right side of history,
[3:45:10.200 --> 3:45:14.200]  I'm fairly confident in asserting that it won't be them.
[3:45:21.200 --> 3:45:23.200]  There you have it, and I mentioned in that video
[3:45:23.200 --> 3:45:26.200]  another case that happened in a spa in L.A.
[3:45:26.200 --> 3:45:29.200]  In fact, it was the same spa, we spa.
[3:45:29.200 --> 3:45:31.200]  We've had several of these incidents come to light
[3:45:31.200 --> 3:45:36.200]  after this initial viral video that emerged last week.
[3:45:36.200 --> 3:45:40.200]  It occurred in January 2020. The headline is,
[3:45:40.200 --> 3:45:45.200]  woman who complained to police about man exposing his genitalia to her 6-year-old daughter
[3:45:45.200 --> 3:45:47.200]  says they blamed her. That's right.
[3:45:47.200 --> 3:45:51.200]  A woman who complained to cops about man exposing his genitalia to her 6-year-old daughter
[3:45:51.200 --> 3:45:54.200]  says she was told by a police officer that it was her fault.
[3:45:54.200 --> 3:45:59.200]  So this was at the same spa, we spa, which has, according to this customer,
[3:45:59.200 --> 3:46:04.200]  who I presume is Korean, a 90-plus percent Korean customer base,
[3:46:04.200 --> 3:46:09.200]  three progressive white people who wanted to inflict their warped ideology
[3:46:09.200 --> 3:46:15.200]  on the rest of the customers there, two women, one man, with his genitals hanging out,
[3:46:15.200 --> 3:46:20.200]  turned up, sat on the edge of the hot tub across from a bunch of elderly Korean women,
[3:46:20.200 --> 3:46:24.200]  and one 6-year-old girl.
[3:46:24.200 --> 3:46:27.200]  The article says the biological male who had a beard,
[3:46:27.200 --> 3:46:31.200]  he was that committed to his gender identity
[3:46:31.200 --> 3:46:37.200]  that he couldn't even be asked to shave his beard off while he has his tackle hanging out.
[3:46:37.200 --> 3:46:41.200]  That's how much of a committed trans person he was.
[3:46:41.200 --> 3:46:44.200]  Sat down at one end of the hot tub with two female companions,
[3:46:44.200 --> 3:46:49.200]  I bet they thought he was really trendy with his meat and two veg hanging out in front of kids,
[3:46:49.200 --> 3:46:51.200]  because that's trendy now.
[3:46:51.200 --> 3:46:56.200]  Immediately making everyone particularly the older Korean women feel extremely uncomfortable.
[3:46:56.200 --> 3:47:03.200]  So the women desperately tried to block the 6-year-old girl from seeing the man's genitals.
[3:47:03.200 --> 3:47:08.200]  They was actually taking care of her in a situation where she was literally being abused
[3:47:08.200 --> 3:47:10.200]  and this individual should have been arrested.
[3:47:10.200 --> 3:47:16.200]  But far from being arrested, when the mother was prompted by the 6-year-old's irate father
[3:47:16.200 --> 3:47:21.200]  to make a formal complaint to cops at a police station near the spa in Koreatown,
[3:47:21.200 --> 3:47:26.200]  she was told the spa is a private business and that they can do what they want.
[3:47:26.200 --> 3:47:32.200]  But one officer, quote, blamed me for having taken her daughter to the spa.
[3:47:32.200 --> 3:47:38.200]  So not only did they do absolutely nothing and basically advocate and support this biological man
[3:47:38.200 --> 3:47:40.200]  with his meat and two veg hanging out,
[3:47:40.200 --> 3:47:44.200]  ogling a 6-year-old girl, because that's trendy now.
[3:47:44.200 --> 3:47:48.200]  They said it was her fault for exposing the girl to that environment.
[3:47:48.200 --> 3:47:51.200]  We truly live in hell.
[3:47:51.200 --> 3:47:57.200]  Meanwhile, I mentioned it earlier, government advisers are now saying to the UK government
[3:47:57.200 --> 3:48:03.200]  that they should include fatigue, headaches, sore throat and diarrhea as COVID symptoms.
[3:48:03.200 --> 3:48:05.200]  Gee, I wonder why they want to do that?
[3:48:05.200 --> 3:48:10.200]  Is it because they want to artificially boost, increase the cases so they can have a yet another
[3:48:10.200 --> 3:48:13.200]  fear-mongering session and lock down the country yet again?
[3:48:13.200 --> 3:48:14.200]  Surely they wouldn't.
[3:48:14.200 --> 3:48:19.200]  I mean, it's not like literal communist extremists who are literally called Stalin's nanny
[3:48:19.200 --> 3:48:22.200]  or advising the government on health policy, is it?
[3:48:22.200 --> 3:48:24.200]  Oh no, that's right, they are, they literally are.
[3:48:24.200 --> 3:48:28.200]  Brainwashing the public with mind control totalitarian methods in their own words
[3:48:28.200 --> 3:48:32.200]  to keep us under these restrictions forever.
[3:48:32.200 --> 3:48:35.200]  Meanwhile, despite vehement support for Black Lives Matter,
[3:48:35.200 --> 3:48:37.200]  Nyman Marcus looted in San Francisco.
[3:48:37.200 --> 3:48:41.200]  Yeah, their virtue signaling didn't really do much good.
[3:48:41.200 --> 3:48:46.200]  You've probably seen the video by now, 10 criminals, all of whom are Black,
[3:48:46.200 --> 3:48:49.200]  in a clearly targeted looting of this luxury goods store
[3:48:49.200 --> 3:48:52.200]  because they really need to feed their kids by stealing food.
[3:48:52.200 --> 3:48:57.200]  Actually, they've got designer handbags and shoes and watches and things like that.
[3:48:57.200 --> 3:49:02.200]  But shockingly, Nyman Marcus was targeted despite prostrating itself for Black Lives Matter
[3:49:02.200 --> 3:49:06.200]  after their stores were looted last year in honor of George Floyd.
[3:49:06.200 --> 3:49:09.200]  They put out a tweet, they did a big public relations campaign
[3:49:09.200 --> 3:49:12.200]  saying how much they supported Black Lives Matter,
[3:49:12.200 --> 3:49:14.200]  and yet they still got looted.
[3:49:14.200 --> 3:49:18.200]  Just as Footlocker donated $200 million to Black Lives Matter
[3:49:18.200 --> 3:49:23.200]  and then saw their stores looted again in response to the police killing of Daunte Wright.
[3:49:23.200 --> 3:49:27.200]  Chick Filet in Philadelphia was also cleaned out by writers last October
[3:49:27.200 --> 3:49:32.200]  despite their CEO shining a black rapper's shoes in a pro Black Lives Matter PR stunt.
[3:49:32.200 --> 3:49:39.200]  Get woke, get looted, war room is next, we'll be back, don't go away.
