[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:20.840]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.840 --> 00:29.240]  get Daniels wrote the story it's up on info wars.com and drugsreport.com we covered it
[00:29.240 --> 00:32.720]  exclusively yesterday and the details but now the article is out breaking it down
[00:32.720 --> 00:38.000]  DOJ creates domestic terrorism division previously labeled libertarians
[00:38.000 --> 00:43.160]  conservatives as domestic terrorists and they go on in the hour and a half video
[00:43.160 --> 00:49.080]  that we played clips of yesterday to say the threat is the sovereign citizen
[00:49.080 --> 00:54.000]  patriot tea party movement that's the key and the story is going viral we're
[00:54.000 --> 00:58.280]  going to add more to the story as the day unfolds we're going to continue adding
[00:58.280 --> 01:03.920]  more research and more documentation to that article and breaking it down today
[01:03.920 --> 01:10.880]  I mentioned the fact that the trial has been going on this week of two of Ron
[01:10.880 --> 01:16.120]  Paul's and Rand Paul's former aides including a chief of staff this is
[01:16.120 --> 01:22.240]  pointed at trying to connect something to Ron Paul or Rand Paul and the thing
[01:22.240 --> 01:28.440]  they claim the aides have done is just from my reading of the campaign law quote
[01:28.440 --> 01:32.560]  giving someone campaign money who's a libertarian and then they in turn endorse
[01:32.560 --> 01:38.960]  you that's how you create a political movement or a political party so this is
[01:38.960 --> 01:43.720]  this is what the feds do if you nest a suicide you make the biggest or second
[01:43.720 --> 01:47.120]  biggest political documentary in history you're about to make the biggest they
[01:47.120 --> 01:52.000]  indict you the persecution of tens of thousands of Christian groups and tea
[01:52.000 --> 01:56.720]  party groups and veterans and gun groups by the IRS I mean we know the orders
[01:56.720 --> 02:02.280]  went out to do this so even if you could argue that maybe these people've done
[02:02.280 --> 02:06.680]  something maybe they had a you know smudge on their jacket or maybe a
[02:06.680 --> 02:11.360]  cricketonial you can't have the big master criminals who are above the law and
[02:11.360 --> 02:16.240]  run fast and furious and run import export deals at the State Department for
[02:16.240 --> 02:24.800]  millions of dollars per agreement I mean it's just open and shut completely over
[02:24.800 --> 02:32.560]  the top evil and then you've got these people persecuting a political war
[02:32.560 --> 02:41.240]  prosecuting the persecution of anyone who is not an absolute anti-american
[02:41.240 --> 02:48.480]  globalist so that's some of the news on that front huge developments obviously
[02:48.480 --> 02:53.440]  in the Middle East and in Europe convert or die ISIS graffiti jihadists

[08:50.760 --> 08:56.800]  their white people defeated by the black captain america because the very essence
[08:56.800 --> 09:06.040]  of having any border and the existence of white people is terrorism and they
[09:06.040 --> 09:12.720]  are terrorist he does take them out and it's almost every cartoon every show they
[09:12.720 --> 09:16.600]  I mean I've tuned into a green lantern show that jacari covered a few years ago
[09:16.600 --> 09:23.040]  and it's tricorner hats and George Washington has basically come from the
[09:23.040 --> 09:29.240]  past and is taken out by green lantern this is the traitorous level of who
[09:29.240 --> 09:36.840]  runs our country just like in machete don johnson the white sheriff goes around
[09:36.840 --> 09:40.760]  shooting pregnant hispanic women in the stomach who beg for their lives there's
[09:40.760 --> 09:46.600]  no known case of that on the border 100,000 people have been killed by the
[09:46.600 --> 09:50.880]  drug cartels our government ship tens of thousands of weapons in that killed
[09:50.880 --> 09:56.720]  thousands fast and furious it's our criminal hijack government killing
[09:56.720 --> 10:01.440]  mexicans along with the criminal mexican government and mexican army that
[10:01.440 --> 10:08.240]  is the drug cartels but it doesn't matter because marvel comics when and
[10:08.240 --> 10:12.400]  we're gonna go over this at a moment when they're done it doesn't matter they
[10:12.400 --> 10:19.400]  even had a marvel comic last year that was me and I'm the bad racist tea party
[10:19.400 --> 10:25.840]  guy taking out I just remember that I mean there are so many examples of this
[10:25.840 --> 10:33.760]  it's crazy and our young people just sit there believing this can you imagine
[10:33.760 --> 10:38.960]  being hispanic person who's whether a citizen here illegally whatever and
[10:38.960 --> 10:42.800]  you're just forced into this whole thing where you're told all the white
[10:42.800 --> 10:48.440]  people hate you and then Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden Obama visit you with all
[10:48.440 --> 10:53.120]  these Ford Foundation operatives with a straight face going if illegals from
[10:53.120 --> 10:58.120]  China to from Eastern Europe from Latin America can't come here and have their
[10:58.120 --> 11:02.080]  babies for free and have everything paid for it's racist and we're sorry you're
[11:02.080 --> 11:07.960]  so hated when Mexico has some of the most draconian borders in the world I'm
[11:07.960 --> 11:14.920]  not even defending that the point is it's just so hypocritical it's so crazy in
[11:14.920 --> 11:19.720]  fact there's a piece that that the mainstream news did on the Captain
[11:19.720 --> 11:23.960]  America pieces on info wars dot com grab that video guys I want to play that
[11:23.960 --> 11:28.760]  at the bottom of the hour when I detail this and go over the comic itself we
[11:28.760 --> 11:32.800]  have the comic so if you're a radio listener by tonight or tomorrow we'll
[11:32.800 --> 11:35.920]  have the video up on info wars dot com you can go there now and see the tiles
[11:35.920 --> 11:39.520]  see the video but we'll have this live report by tomorrow but if you want to
[11:39.520 --> 11:45.960]  watch it live info wars dot com forward slash show and the issue I'm getting at
[11:45.960 --> 11:54.160]  here is that this is a full court press almost every drama every cop show every
[11:54.160 --> 12:01.480]  mystery show every conspiracy show every comic show a superhero show that I
[12:01.480 --> 12:05.320]  rarely see in a hotel room on vacation I'll be trying to let my kids watch
[12:05.320 --> 12:08.000]  television while we eat room service or something I don't want to watch a lot of
[12:08.000 --> 12:12.880]  TV at home and I'll turn on Nickelodeon and shows for seven-year-olds they're
[12:12.880 --> 12:18.400]  pushing homosexuality I tuned to another channel and sure enough there's an evil
[12:18.400 --> 12:22.640]  right-wing polluter group being taken out by the leftist superheroes and I
[12:22.640 --> 12:27.800]  tuned to the next channel and it's just like mentally ill short attention span
[12:27.800 --> 12:32.720]  brainwashing with all this flash animation moving so quick with subliminals
[12:32.720 --> 12:38.680]  it's meant to rewire your kids brains on record so there's not just propaganda
[12:38.680 --> 12:44.560]  there's savage brainwashing going on to rewire your children's brains and by
[12:44.560 --> 12:50.280]  the way remember 15 years ago Pokemon in the United States and Japan caused
[12:50.280 --> 12:57.400]  tens of thousands of convulsions you know why because they're able to flash a
[12:57.400 --> 13:04.120]  flicker rate with a television it's so powerful that you actually go into
[13:04.120 --> 13:08.680]  convulsions and children are more susceptible now that's when they turn
[13:08.680 --> 13:12.520]  it up too high just like when you get a bad reaction to a vaccine it's just
[13:12.520 --> 13:16.840]  meant to brain damage you it's just meant to lower your IQ but if you have a
[13:16.840 --> 13:19.440]  really bad reaction you never talk again and they're in diapers for the rest
[13:19.440 --> 13:23.320]  of your life and it's the same thing you're not meant to completely run off
[13:23.320 --> 13:26.960]  the you know fall off the balcony when you're watching TV on the porch or
[13:26.960 --> 13:31.520]  whatever when you watch Pokemon but they they tested it to such a high flicker
[13:31.520 --> 13:37.680]  rate that it put people into convulsions by the way you think I'm joking I see
[13:37.680 --> 13:41.760]  there's so much intel my brain is just burning I mentioned the new captain
[13:41.760 --> 13:45.920]  America who's black who takes out racist white people who want to have a border
[13:45.920 --> 13:49.320]  because the racist white people are down at the border murdering Hispanic
[13:49.320 --> 13:54.120]  families how dare you cowards kill the innocent Hispanic women I Captain
[13:54.120 --> 13:59.520]  America will now kill you we support the Constitution America we are the death
[13:59.520 --> 14:15.840]  serpent remember Red Skull he was Hydra with the Nazis here is Marvel Avengers
[14:15.840 --> 14:22.760]  here's the issue for everybody this is 004 from what two years ago look who Red
[14:22.760 --> 14:28.440]  Skull has working for him Alex Jones that's right I worked for Red Skull you
[14:28.440 --> 14:32.920]  didn't you didn't know I worked for Red Skull against the white Captain America
[14:32.920 --> 14:38.960]  who's now been killed of course and we have the black Captain America it
[14:38.960 --> 14:42.320]  wouldn't be better they had a black Captain America I don't care black
[14:42.320 --> 14:47.760]  Green Lantern whatever but see it has to be a black Captain America will put the
[14:47.760 --> 14:54.360]  new article up because the black Captain America takes on the all white evil
[14:54.360 --> 15:01.600]  serpent group and the Mexican families beg please don't kill us but don't worry
[15:01.600 --> 15:07.600]  you saw Don Johnson kill that pregnant Hispanic woman it didn't really happen
[15:07.600 --> 15:11.800]  but it doesn't matter you know who really is killing the pregnant women
[15:11.800 --> 15:15.680]  they're killing their capacity of a baby it's the loving vaccines and the
[15:15.680 --> 15:21.000]  forced Gardasil confirmed mainstream news to be linked to autoimmune disorders
[15:21.000 --> 15:27.800]  death convulsions and reduced fertility or sterility but that's okay because
[15:27.800 --> 15:33.640]  Laura and Metcha for those in the race everything those outside the race
[15:33.640 --> 15:38.000]  nothing it's okay because the group that comes and says we're here to protect
[15:38.000 --> 15:42.520]  you we're here we're we're with your race just like a white supremacist group
[15:42.520 --> 15:46.480]  tells the whites in the prison we're gonna protect you but really they just
[15:46.480 --> 15:50.080]  feed on them and use them as their muscle to carry out criminal operations
[15:50.080 --> 15:56.080]  just like black street gang leaders feed on their members the same thing and
[15:56.080 --> 16:02.000]  they'll never tell you they're killing you and laughing at you oh yes I want to
[16:02.000 --> 16:06.240]  have something on the border and not pay for the whole third world to come here
[16:06.240 --> 16:09.920]  and be filled full of political hate towards the Republic by the giant
[16:09.920 --> 16:16.280]  brainwashing machine of Telemundo and Marvel and CNN and MSNBC so I'm the red
[16:16.280 --> 16:26.240]  skull in this issue the red skull has the Tea Party working for them and it's so
[16:26.240 --> 16:30.280]  sick and they do other things that this isn't subliminal but they have
[16:30.280 --> 16:35.680]  subliminals in Comedy Central ABC news NBC news mainstream television shows but
[16:35.680 --> 16:40.240]  also on Ron Paul where they'll flash methhead and Ron Paul for just one
[16:40.240 --> 16:45.320]  tenth of a second or they'll flash for one second in fall wars saying Michael
[16:45.320 --> 16:51.160]  Jackson lives with aliens on a space station and Alex Jones is a cook they'll

[17:35.840 --> 17:41.040]  Army Air Corps so I get to have sacks of crap like the ADL try to imply I'm a
[17:41.040 --> 17:46.560]  Nazi while they defend and give their highest award to George Soros an actual
[17:46.560 --> 17:54.360]  Nazi collaborator who now backs real Nazis in Ukraine murdering tens of

[35:11.000 --> 35:15.800]  I was just thinking about truth is stranger than fiction a lot of art
[35:15.800 --> 35:20.200]  imitates life the Wachowski brothers admit that's what that films about where
[35:20.200 --> 35:29.000]  they see America and England going and we're really now getting to that point
[35:29.000 --> 35:43.400]  we're now coming to the point of where we live in a true high-tech brainwashing
[35:43.400 --> 35:51.200]  grit where almost every TV show movie news article is written as a conscious
[35:51.200 --> 35:59.400]  deception to skew reality remember how they said that Obamacare was gonna be
[35:59.400 --> 36:04.040]  free at first then it was gonna cut your price in half then it was going to let
[36:04.040 --> 36:09.440]  you keep your doctor and there were no death panels there was no rationing of
[36:09.440 --> 36:17.400]  care and one month after it passed news week time the White House all of them
[36:17.400 --> 36:21.920]  came out and said guess what there really are death panels Bill Gates said it to
[36:21.920 --> 36:30.320]  have the cover the news week the case for killing grannies and it was just so
[36:30.320 --> 36:35.040]  funny to them to rub it in our face and now they have the don't treat list for
[36:35.040 --> 36:49.560]  the veterans and they just sit there in our face rubbing it in dominating setting
[36:49.560 --> 36:58.120]  the precedent with mass Stockholm syndrome and learned helplessness to
[36:58.120 --> 37:05.200]  fatigue the public spiritually physically psychologically into a broke back
[37:05.200 --> 37:13.080]  submission they're breaking our will they're destroying our will to fight
[37:13.080 --> 37:21.600]  well my will to fight against these monsters has never been stronger and a
[37:21.600 --> 37:27.960]  lot of people have gone from the point of disbelief to awakening to despair to
[37:27.960 --> 37:37.720]  gutting up to realize we are against abject conscious criminals the most
[37:37.720 --> 37:46.880]  important thing we can do is understand no amount of extreme rhetoric can even
[37:46.880 --> 37:51.920]  get near how bad these people are and that their greatest strength is also
[37:51.920 --> 37:58.720]  their greatest weakness that that that that they are so completely and totally
[37:58.720 --> 38:08.360]  over-the-top oppressive so completely deceptive so completely criminal and
[38:08.360 --> 38:19.440]  hateful of real freedom and their will to conquer and dominate us is so crazed
[38:19.440 --> 38:25.200]  so rabies like that a lot of people just can't believe it's actually happening
[38:25.200 --> 38:31.520]  or they're intimidated by it and just tune out but it doesn't matter if 50 60
[38:31.520 --> 38:35.680]  percent of people just decide to drool and get in a fetal position and urinate
[38:35.680 --> 38:42.120]  on themselves crying for mommy suck in their thumb a large animated minority a
[38:42.120 --> 38:51.840]  good 20 percent now is really coming to grips with the fact that we are in the
[38:51.840 --> 38:58.360]  hands we are in the clutches we are in the talents of people that aren't gonna
[38:58.360 --> 39:04.400]  give us quarter we have no hope we have no future there's nothing left to do
[39:04.400 --> 39:09.520]  now but stand up against them and you need to let Marvel Comics and Hollywood
[39:09.520 --> 39:14.640]  and and in Disney the parent company and all these big globalist operations know
[39:14.640 --> 39:20.800]  that you're fully aware of what savage social engineers they are and how much
[39:20.800 --> 39:26.680]  hate they have for this country and how they've conquered this nation and that
[39:26.680 --> 39:32.640]  they plan on gutting what's left of it and turning us into third-world slaves
[39:32.640 --> 39:37.080]  you see the people that run America took the treasure and the power of this
[39:37.080 --> 39:42.240]  republic and used it to pretty much take over the world they're now trying to
[39:42.240 --> 39:47.160]  mop up the planet Hollywood isn't even really totally focused on domestic now
[39:47.160 --> 39:51.200]  it's mainly focused international you go see any blockbuster it's a bunch of
[39:51.200 --> 40:02.640]  world government pro-communist China builds these are absolutely reprobate
[40:02.640 --> 40:18.680]  anathema soulless heartless mercenaries at CNN and MSNBC I was watching Fox News
[40:18.680 --> 40:25.640]  yesterday Shepherd Smith clip on info wars.com dealing with Cuban troops now
[40:25.640 --> 40:37.600]  in Syria and he was just up there over and over again using brainwashing
[40:37.600 --> 40:49.280]  terms to say that Russia was helping ISIS and that Russia had basically
[40:49.280 --> 40:57.120]  started everything and that Russia was bad well Russia didn't start the fight
[40:57.120 --> 41:03.080]  Russia has two international military bases not 400 Russia doesn't put fluoride
[41:03.080 --> 41:07.120]  in their water Russia doesn't force inoculate Russia isn't trying to take
[41:07.120 --> 41:14.280]  my guns Russia isn't saying the founding fathers are bad Marvel comics as bad as
[41:14.280 --> 41:20.960]  Russia is compared to the absolute traitorous Russia's trying to stop the
[41:20.960 --> 41:25.440]  massive radical Islamic flow into Europe
[41:26.960 --> 41:33.280]  Russia's openly saying George Soros wants to destroy America and Europe Russia
[41:33.280 --> 41:38.000]  is openly banned more than seven groups George Soros funds in Russia who he
[41:38.000 --> 41:42.640]  admits is there to overthrow the government I mean how bizarre is that
[41:42.640 --> 41:51.000]  that a weirdo Nazi collaborator who's almost 90 years old runs MSNBC the
[41:51.000 --> 41:56.120]  Huffington Post media matters and scores of other organizations and all they do
[41:56.120 --> 42:01.040]  all day is attack Alex Jones Matt Drudge world net daily free speech talk
[42:01.040 --> 42:08.480]  radio and the Russian government and now George Soros the coast from a year ago
[42:08.480 --> 42:13.160]  we have this flashback I'm gonna play in a moment that's our next clip saying
[42:13.160 --> 42:16.560]  don't underestimate Russia of course don't underestimate Russia when you
[42:16.560 --> 42:22.400]  encircle it with radical jihad forces from Chechnya to Ukraine and start
[42:22.400 --> 42:27.120]  blowing up and attacking police and military bases the same thing they're
[42:27.120 --> 42:30.560]  trying to get going here against police departments recruiting centers and
[42:30.560 --> 42:37.200]  military bases we've got hardcore revolutionaries in control of the
[42:37.200 --> 42:41.560]  government who want a revolution against your church want a revolution over
[42:41.560 --> 42:48.360]  your family want a revolution over your bank account they want to dominate you
[42:48.360 --> 42:53.000]  and break you you understand like like most rapists don't rape women because
[42:53.000 --> 42:57.240]  they want the pleasure of having sex with a woman they do it because they
[42:57.240 --> 43:01.240]  like to break their nose break their collarbone break their cheekbone and
[43:01.240 --> 43:07.680]  rape them and hurt them that's the nature of hardcore wicked evil people they
[43:07.680 --> 43:13.560]  want to get you in a FEMA camp and break your jaw with Billy clubs they want
[43:13.560 --> 43:19.280]  to burn your house down with you in it they want to break your will and have
[43:19.280 --> 43:23.440]  your children you understand that and they're coming and they mean business
[43:23.440 --> 43:27.880]  and you notice I'm taking the gloves off of these people because this is the
[43:27.880 --> 43:32.920]  reality they flooded Europe with five million radical islamics the last year
[43:32.920 --> 43:38.720]  and a half and they tell the Germans you're going to come and compulsory
[43:38.720 --> 43:42.040]  volunteer and you're going to clean their dorms and you're going to make
[43:42.040 --> 43:46.000]  their beds while they sit there and spit on you but we fool them full of leftist
[43:46.000 --> 43:50.360]  hatred and you're not going to have October Fest and you're not going to
[43:50.360 --> 43:57.280]  wear short skirts you're going to do what we say you understand or you get out
[43:57.280 --> 44:04.400]  of here you don't your pro life your pro gun get out of New York you don't want
[44:04.400 --> 44:07.720]  totally open borders and to pay for the whole world to come here we're going to
[44:07.720 --> 44:12.240]  put you in a comic book as a terrorist we're gonna have a black captain America
[44:12.240 --> 44:23.360]  kill you how sick is that while they hear blacks double unemployment when they
[44:23.360 --> 44:27.080]  know full well in every study fluoride is two to three times worse depending on
[44:27.080 --> 44:32.720]  the disease for Africans I mean fluoride is a death sentence long-term for any
[44:32.720 --> 44:37.320]  human but you give it to black people you like heart attacks you like hypertension
[44:37.320 --> 44:41.280]  you like high blood pressure you like bone cancer you like testicular cancer
[44:41.280 --> 44:47.520]  you like liver cancer baby fluoride to black people's at death sentence
[44:49.160 --> 44:55.880]  look it up just type in fluoride causes more harm to blacks but don't worry
[44:55.880 --> 45:01.360]  captain America likes you is going to teach you to get the whitey the poor
[45:01.360 --> 45:05.400]  pathetic white down the road that's in the exact same globalist position you're
[45:05.400 --> 45:10.240]  in under attack that's all they got is dividing us against each other it's
[45:10.240 --> 45:17.440]  sick and it's filthy here's George Soros I'm talking about for instance the
[45:17.440 --> 45:25.960]  threat posed by by Russia a research in Russia I the European public and
[45:25.960 --> 45:34.600]  apparently many of the leaders are not sufficiently aware of that danger and
[45:34.600 --> 45:44.320]  Europe doesn't behave like an association of countries that is under attack so
[45:44.320 --> 45:51.840]  that's one of the major uncertainties and it's really up to the
[45:51.840 --> 46:00.480]  international authorities to provide Ukraine the financial support that it
[46:00.480 --> 46:07.720]  needs in order to set up to add actual military and and financial assault which
[46:07.720 --> 46:13.960]  is an assault on the very foundations of the values that the European Union is
[46:13.960 --> 46:21.000]  based on so that's one very important thing we should talk more about Russia in
[46:21.000 --> 46:25.600]  1991 turned off its air defenses and stopped doing patrols outside the
[46:25.600 --> 46:30.240]  country nature responded by moving heavy weapons and nuclear weapons up to the
[46:30.240 --> 46:35.640]  border of Russia and by sending in color revolution teams to bring Russia down
[46:35.640 --> 46:41.440]  but George Soros gets up there he fought against Russia when he was a young
[46:41.440 --> 46:51.360]  man for the Nazis in police and secret police activities and now we have to
[46:51.360 --> 46:58.560]  sit here and look at him a lie and say that Russia is attacking Europe but he's
[46:58.560 --> 47:05.480]  now under fire in his own homeland because people see right through it
[47:05.480 --> 47:09.560]  hedge fund mogul Soros has come under fire in his native Hungary for politicians
[47:09.560 --> 47:13.000]  have accused him of supporting legal migration amidst a refugee crisis that
[47:13.000 --> 47:17.000]  brought the right-wing government under pressure because that's mainly where
[47:17.000 --> 47:20.160]  folks are pouring in is Hungary and Romania by the millions and things are
[47:20.160 --> 47:23.760]  just collapsing and Europe just says take them that's the way it is ha ha ha
[47:23.760 --> 47:28.000]  then they call them racist because they don't want to
[47:30.760 --> 47:35.840]  now earlier I showed you the Avengers from about a year and a half ago where
[47:35.840 --> 47:39.200]  they've got me in there with Red Skull where Red Skull runs the Tea Party to
[47:39.200 --> 47:44.000]  attack the peaceful immigrants but Thor comes with Captain America and defeats
[47:44.000 --> 47:48.080]  the white people but it's not good to have white people white Captain America
[47:48.080 --> 47:53.720]  and a white Thor defeating the evil white people you've got to have a black
[47:53.720 --> 47:57.360]  Captain America to get the race war really going who attacks a tea party
[47:57.360 --> 48:02.360]  group who's killing Mexicans on the border and you can actually see the
[48:02.360 --> 48:09.520]  article with the comic up on info wars dot com and it's how dare you attack
[48:09.520 --> 48:13.000]  women women and children because they're Hispanic shut up we're doing the
[48:13.000 --> 48:18.920]  Lord's work and the Constitution you will meet the serpent but then Captain
[48:18.920 --> 48:22.480]  America comes down and takes them out let's scroll through it so folks can
[48:22.480 --> 48:27.600]  can see it Captain America is gonna stand up against this tea party don't
[48:27.600 --> 48:34.800]  you ever worry so let's go ahead now and go to this piece writing it down and
[48:34.800 --> 48:37.760]  then I'm gonna go more over the propaganda this is just one small
[48:37.760 --> 48:42.520]  sampling here it is not something the Kiber news typically covers but Marvel
[48:42.520 --> 48:46.320]  comics released the first issue of its new Captain America series on Wednesday
[48:46.320 --> 48:50.880]  and Marvel decided to make some strong ideological statements on some hot
[48:50.880 --> 48:55.960]  political topics the new villains in this comic are conservatives who are
[48:55.960 --> 49:00.640]  portrayed as a right-wing terrorist group called the sons of the serpent they
[49:00.640 --> 49:04.440]  stop a group of immigrants trying to cross the border who they accuse of
[49:04.440 --> 49:08.440]  invading a sovereign land to spread disease and crime take American jobs
[49:08.440 --> 49:13.800]  and collect welfare then Captain America comes and beats them up those in the
[49:13.800 --> 49:17.880]  country who disagree with Captain America's new partisan agenda accuse him
[49:17.880 --> 49:22.840]  of being anti-American against the Constitution they even call him Captain
[49:22.840 --> 49:27.800]  socialism he says all he wanted to do was to bring folks together oh yeah
[49:27.800 --> 49:33.120]  Marvel Comics is owned by Disney who also owns ABC and ESPN the company is
[49:33.120 --> 49:37.640]  currently in the middle of reinventing itself hoping to attract younger readers
[49:37.640 --> 49:43.040]  while capitalizing on the success of its movies for the McIver Institute I'm
[49:43.040 --> 49:48.480]  Bill Osmolsky that's a good report by those folks but this is unified this
[49:48.480 --> 49:53.320]  isn't just Disney it's all of the big six media companies owned and run by the
[49:53.320 --> 50:00.400]  big five banks it's Fox television entertainment is full of all this this
[50:00.400 --> 50:13.400]  is a total agenda in your face to demonize anyone that dares speak out
[50:13.400 --> 50:16.440]  against the end of sovereignty and being conquered by globalism by
[50:16.440 --> 50:22.320]  multinationals who are enslaving the whole world and selling the third world
[50:22.320 --> 50:25.880]  that oh we're going to push world government to give you all this free
[50:25.880 --> 50:32.760]  stuff but five years ago when we got the world treaty the Danish text at Copenhagen
[50:32.760 --> 50:38.200]  remember what it said right at double the taxes on the third world under carbon
[50:38.200 --> 50:43.200]  taxes that the first world's gonna pay it's really a death sentence for the
[50:43.200 --> 50:49.440]  third world for Africa for the Middle East for poor areas of Asia but it
[50:49.440 --> 50:53.360]  doesn't matter because the average person gets their news from comic books and
[50:53.360 --> 50:58.880]  Marvel TV shows and movies I see full grown men who believe this is real my
[50:58.880 --> 51:02.160]  dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year just this
[51:02.160 --> 51:05.760]  past August was when we spread his ashes on the St. Croix River I loved my dad

[59:00.160 --> 59:04.360]  x2 it's something that really has been hiding in plain view for over a hundred
[59:04.360 --> 59:08.640]  years the federal government mandated from the 20s until the 70s that iodine
[59:08.640 --> 59:12.200]  accrued form of it be added to table salt because of the incredible health

[01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:07.360]  jacari Jackson cut this parallel big brother mainstream media to Captain
[01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:11.760]  America government cover what's really happening in our world today well so does
[01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:16.720]  he he's Alex we are facing weaponized media it's becoming more naked they've
[01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:21.800]  legalized CIA operations in the media we are the organic response we have the
[01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:26.600]  secret weapon the truth and here is Jackson's breakdown
[01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:39.360]  do you want to kill Nazis I don't want to kill anyone I don't like bullies I
[01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:43.920]  don't care where they're from I believe Captain America was a composite
[01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:48.360]  character that really kind of captured the essence of that generation there's
[01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:51.880]  another analogy to be taken from Captain America and that is that that
[01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:56.560]  generation and America in general has essentially fallen asleep like Captain
[01:00:56.560 --> 01:01:01.040]  America did as you see him wake up in the second Captain America movie to find
[01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:05.200]  that he's living in an authoritarian police state for a second day in a row
[01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:09.440]  a group of World War two vets literally took down a barrier blocking off the
[01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:14.320]  World War two Memorial in Washington DC
[01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:18.080]  well you seem pretty chipper for someone who just found out they died for
[01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:23.160]  nothing well I go protect Iraq he's in Iraq and I come back and I find that my
[01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:27.600]  fellow Americans are being attacked by
[01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:37.960]  the danger once we're way ahead of the curve by holding a gun to everyone on
[01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:41.760]  earth and calling it protection the police and National Guard going street
[01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:48.040]  by street house to house instructions to disarm anyone inside
[01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:52.240]  going to neutralize a lot of threats before they even happen the punishment
[01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:56.480]  usually came after the crime and when they say I want my lawyer you tell them
[01:01:56.480 --> 01:02:02.120]  shut up your time to get a lawyer you're an enemy combat yes this is nasty
[01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:07.080]  stuff yeah we compromised sometimes in ways that made us not sleep so well
[01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:10.440]  when I was in Afghanistan they usually kept us outside these buildings and the
[01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:14.360]  other government agency guys probably like DEA CIA and all that they would go
[01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:18.200]  into these kind of rooms like that exactly and they would be a torturing
[01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:21.720]  people from in there horrible scream to hear a grown person like that being
[01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:25.440]  tortured and you're watching as this opium is being grown we provide them
[01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:28.800]  security we're providing them resources and we're providing them alternatives
[01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:34.000]  Captain America is a fugitive from shield with all due respect if shield is
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:37.440]  conducting a manhunt for Captain America we deserve to know why you have a lot of
[01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:40.040]  people that are coming out of the military that have the ability and the
[01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:45.080]  knowledge to to build IEDs and to defeat law enforcement techniques this is
[01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:48.640]  only gonna get worse once it starts and again there's no veterans doing
[01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:53.400]  anything right now no IEDs they are literally getting the police to pick a
[01:02:53.400 --> 01:03:00.920]  fight with veterans. You are standing in my brain. How did you get here? Invited.
[01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:06.160]  Operation paperclip after World War two shield recruited German scientists with
[01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:11.680]  strategic values. All I could have their cause. Operation paperclip explores the
[01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:15.960]  secret military program that hired scientists who use slave labor to build
[01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:20.280]  the V2 rocket and others who use concentration camp victims for human
[01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:24.440]  experiments. The responsibility for the staggering loss of life and property is
[01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:28.400]  uniformly placed on Hitler and the Nazis but excluded from the official
[01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:32.320]  history is the fact that Hitler and the National Socialists would not have
[01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:37.360]  risen to power without the help of international bankers and American and
[01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:41.720]  German corporations. She's disabling security protocols and dumping all the
[01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:46.920]  secrets under the internet. Including hydras. And shields. What about Bradley Manning?
[01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:57.720]  I think the revelations are terrible because they were revealed what's
[01:03:57.720 --> 01:04:04.740]  his name? Snowden. Yes, Snowden. I think he's a traitor. What about the others? Are you
[01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:08.000]  planning a rescue mission? You think about what is going on with the Veterans
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:11.560]  Administration Hospital and the fact that we have veterans that are dying
[01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:15.880]  because they're on a wait list. We talk about Sergeant Tamarisi and his situation.
[01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:17.880]  I just want you to know, Kat.
[01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:19.880]  Herschel!
[01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:26.560]  Something that I've been upset about and raised and cain about and so I'm gonna
[01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:32.720]  ask you about it. And that's this right-wing extremism report that was
[01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:36.440]  mailed out to all law enforcement officials from the United States. I have
[01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:41.120]  apologized for that report. It was not authorized to be distributed. This is a
[01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:46.160]  treaty. This is for you. Shield takes the world as it is, not as we'd like it to be.
[01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:51.320]  This is getting damn near past time you can get put that program, Captain.

[01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:17.480]  We have seen unprecedented persecution of whistleblowers and the press. We have
[01:08:17.480 --> 01:08:22.240]  seen the IRS memos come out publicly that they are targeting Christians,
[01:08:22.240 --> 01:08:30.360]  conservatives, Republicans, libertarians, veterans organizations. We have seen them
[01:08:30.360 --> 01:08:36.000]  commit fast and furious Benghazi openly fond Al Qaeda and ISIS. We have seen
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:42.120]  them launch proxy wars against Russia in Syria and Ukraine. We have seen them
[01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:47.160]  continue to debase the dollar and sign us bipartisanly on to the economy killing
[01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:55.200]  mass screw job that is Obamacare and the banker bailouts. And now we see such
[01:08:55.200 --> 01:09:03.400]  intensification of programming in comedies and movies and cop shows and
[01:09:03.400 --> 01:09:09.200]  superhero programs where the founding fathers are bad, Christians are bad, gun
[01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:15.280]  owners are bad, white people are inherently evil. This is all a bunch of
[01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:20.600]  old white executives pushing this. This is total divide and conquer to get us
[01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:25.280]  fighting with each other while the globalist Rob is blind. The former chief
[01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:29.160]  economist of the World Bank, I'm going to play this clip in a moment, Joseph
[01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:35.800]  Sticklets, who's won two Nobel Prizes, one for economics and the other, I believe
[01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:39.840]  it was for peace, was a joint one. He's been on the show many times, going to work
[01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:45.120]  on getting him back on. And he was there in 2002 when he resigned that a bunch of
[01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:49.400]  documents got leaked, he says he didn't do it, where they planned to implode the
[01:09:49.400 --> 01:09:54.720]  West next with too big to fail programs, signing us on to derivatives, starting
[01:09:54.720 --> 01:10:01.840]  with Europe and then the United States. And they call it the IMF riot. They
[01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:07.320]  stir up society, they stir up cultures, they destabilize the civilization. Then
[01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:11.000]  they pose as saviors to take even more rights during the emergency that could
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:17.200]  last years. The value of the currency, the value of infrastructure, the value of
[01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:21.440]  companies goes down, the multinationals come in and buy it up, propitize on the
[01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:27.400]  dollar, and the multilateral systems, the multinationals, have set up our tax
[01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:40.920]  exempt. IBM, Microsoft, Apple, General Electric, Google, General Motors,
[01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:47.240]  the Fortune 100, and it goes up into the 200s, but the Fortune 100 across the
[01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:54.640]  board take 90% of their profits offshore and never pay tax, and have written the
[01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:59.640]  international law where if somebody tries to put $2 million in a Swiss bank
[01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:03.600]  account, their life savings, they claim it's illegal and take your money, even if
[01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:07.560]  it's after tax. You try to put your money in the Grand Caymans, they come after
[01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:16.680]  you, if it's $500,000, but if it's 10, 20 million, you are untouchable, and they
[01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:21.360]  pass the laws where their yachts are tax exempt while they raise the taxes on the
[01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:29.080]  Greek people. They know what they're doing, and then how do they stop the
[01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:33.520]  people from getting wives to the screw job, how they raise taxes on us to give
[01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:38.800]  themselves the corporate welfare in the bank or bailout? They have Disney, they
[01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:47.640]  have News Corp, they have Time Warner, and two other companies teach pedophilia
[01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:52.600]  on television, teach the end of the family that he and she is hateful, that
[01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:58.480]  Boy and Girl is hateful, and that all white people are racist, and that not
[01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:07.040]  doing what you're told is sexist. MTV yesterday, we had the report said, not
[01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:12.320]  agreeing with a woman's selfie, not saying you like it is sexist. You go, that
[01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:15.520]  just sounds silly, it sounds stupid. Absolutely, it's meant to, it dumbs the
[01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:19.240]  culture down, where young people don't know about the seven continents, they
[01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:22.920]  don't know about the north and south pole, the Arctic Antarctic, they don't know
[01:12:22.920 --> 01:12:28.200]  about fission, fusion, they don't know about Hadron Collider, cyclotrons, they
[01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:31.480]  don't know about quantum mechanics, physics, they don't know about literature,
[01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:36.680]  Beethoven, they all they know how to do is run around and freak out with their
[01:12:36.680 --> 01:12:41.200]  weird, arrogant identity that they're good and you're bad because they're a
[01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:49.040]  liberal trendy, when they are in a true, classical, by every benchmark, serious
[01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:58.320]  cult that is about only using approved language, having a very small repertoire
[01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:06.440]  of friends, not being able to publicly speak, just put your hands on your hip
[01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:13.000]  and feel incensed. This is unbelievable. Let's go ahead and go to this Joseph
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:17.400]  Sticklet's clip, where he just came out yesterday and said, the multinationals
[01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:21.160]  must pay taxes, they cannot squeeze any more money out of poor people in the
[01:13:21.160 --> 01:13:25.720]  middle class and the multinationals are unified, they're the ones that want your
[01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:29.640]  guns, they're the ones that have the unified staging of the interest rates,
[01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:36.120]  staging of the currency rates, staging of the stock markets, look I tell you
[01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:43.000]  this 20 years ago, it's all admitted now, secret treaties we can't see, it's
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:49.800]  incredible, we're not being conquered by the redcoats in the war 1812, we're not
[01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:53.600]  being conquered by the Nazis or the Soviets, we've been conquered by white
[01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:59.520]  collar criminals that are Bernie made off to the power of infinity.
[01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:06.600]  George Soros talks about raising taxes on rich people while he lobbies
[01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:15.160]  worldwide to be exempt. Warren Buffett, same deal and I know I harp on this, but
[01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:22.040]  anytime I turn on Disney run television, ABC, all I hear is Warren Buffett loves
[01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:27.480]  you and his secretary pays a higher tax rate than he does and he doesn't like it.
[01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:31.440]  That's why he's lobbying for this new tax incentive of Obama that will raise
[01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:36.240]  taxes on rich people, it raises taxes on people that made over a hundred thousand
[01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:43.960]  dollars up to four million and then it starts going down and then he's got a
[01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:50.680]  multinational system set up, but he knows you're ignorant. Don Johnson didn't shoot
[01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:55.880]  a pregnant woman on the border, the Mexican cartels torture him to death,
[01:14:55.880 --> 01:15:02.280]  evil cartels do it, it doesn't matter because machete funded by the White House
[01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:07.120]  and I have that inside intel, it's now come out by the government, says they're
[01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:10.440]  white people down there shooting Mexican women in the stomach to create racial
[01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:19.040]  hatred and now I covered a lot the last hour Marvel Comics up on info wars.com
[01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:28.640]  openly saying that Captain America, the black Captain America is taking out the
[01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:32.240]  evil white people that are down there attacking the poor immigrants, the same
[01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:39.040]  stupid script that they hand TV producers, comic book designers, the same
[01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:44.360]  mindless script over and over again, hammering fraud, hammering lies, hammering
[01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:49.200]  brainwashing, it's so sick, that's their plan to keep us fighting with each other
[01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:55.400]  while they start World War 3. While they let Monsanto, it's now come out in the
[01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:59.240]  new treaty, the sections that were leaked last week by WikiLeaks, that your
[01:15:59.240 --> 01:16:04.160]  country won't be able to stop GMO, you'll be forced to eat it, you have no
[01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:08.880]  sovereignty if they're able to ram this through and because it's so evil, your
[01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:14.520]  government, your Congress isn't allowed to see it because we're in a world
[01:16:14.520 --> 01:16:22.960]  government. Let's go ahead and go to this Diglett's clip. We want the
[01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:27.600]  multilateral corporations to pay their fair share of taxes, it's really that
[01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:30.440]  simple. But you can't blame them for taking advantage of a system that's
[01:16:30.440 --> 01:16:34.960]  again that's in their favor. Absolutely, but they helped create this system and
[01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:40.520]  the exciting thing that's going on right now is the G20 realized, the advanced
[01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:45.280]  countries realized that just something was wrong, when Apple, Google, Starbucks
[01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:49.840]  were able to move their profits around and then pay almost no taxes, you had
[01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:54.640]  Apple, the largest corporation by capitalization in the world paying almost
[01:16:54.640 --> 01:16:58.560]  no taxes and so the question is something's wrong with the system and
[01:16:58.560 --> 01:17:03.560]  that's what we're focusing on. But repairing that system is very difficult
[01:17:03.560 --> 01:17:07.000]  because you have got the Goliath and the David, you have got this wall of money
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:12.800]  and you have an enormous vested interest by these companies. To prevent you from
[01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:17.920]  doing it. That's right, now the good news is that OECD has this process called
[01:17:17.920 --> 01:17:24.320]  BEPS, base erosion, where they're trying to figure out how how can we deal with
[01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:29.400]  the base erosion, the disappearing of the base tax base and they've actually come
[01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:34.000]  up with some very good ideas. Our commission argues that it hasn't gone
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:38.440]  far enough and particularly with respect to the developing countries, the
[01:17:38.440 --> 01:17:42.320]  problem is we told the developing countries, open up your markets to the
[01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:47.000]  multinationals. They've already stolen all the wealth, they've already bankrupted
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.480]  all the countries and the individuals by design, they've already signed every
[01:17:49.480 --> 01:17:53.200]  American at the day they're born onto millions, over a million dollars in
[01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:59.120]  fake debt. So now they're gonna talk about, oh the eroding tax base, it's so
[01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:03.440]  terrible. I don't think Stigl's is a bad guy himself, but they have these
[01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:08.840]  little commissions that'll call for taxing corporations but then they don't
[01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:13.240]  even tax the big ones, they tax the middle-sized ones. It's all selective to
[01:18:13.240 --> 01:18:20.280]  again consolidate power, consolidate wealth. So when you see all this race
[01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:25.560]  division, all this kill the cops stuff, all this socialist redistribution
[01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:29.320]  propaganda from Bernie Sanders, you don't hear him saying audit the Fed, he
[01:18:29.320 --> 01:18:34.840]  killed that. You hear him talking about Walmart and individuals that are worth
[01:18:34.840 --> 01:18:38.640]  40 billion a piece and I agree they did it through game in the system. I don't
[01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:45.480]  think Walmart was free market but you notice the CNN idiot goes, but you
[01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:51.960]  can't blame them for for using the system, they are the system. They set it up
[01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:58.960]  and Walmart was allowed to operate like this to consolidate the supply chain to
[01:18:58.960 --> 01:19:03.640]  a few globalist corporations to make sure that only select companies can make
[01:19:03.640 --> 01:19:09.840]  the big profits long term off Chinese slave goods. That's why Apple such a big
[01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:14.800]  supporter of the Communist government of China because they run factories where
[01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:20.520]  people are treated worse than many slaves were treated in this country long
[01:19:20.520 --> 01:19:24.440]  term. I mean it's some of the most hellish conditions but it's not called
[01:19:24.440 --> 01:19:28.600]  slavery because it's trendy. Communists cannot engage in slavery, they engage in
[01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:33.320]  love, they engaged in when they take your organs or force labor you to death or
[01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:37.480]  suicide you, it is a sacrament of friendly trendiness when they work your
[01:19:37.480 --> 01:19:44.840]  fingers to bleeding bones. Because I mean Apple Steve Jobs, I mean Apple, Apple's
[01:19:44.840 --> 01:19:48.040]  little trendies wearing little white t-shirts going non-threatening, non-threatening
[01:19:48.040 --> 01:19:52.480]  with huge black ops squads with a total plan to take over and end total
[01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:57.640]  freedom as we know it. Okay, they're savage, they hate you, they're in control,
[01:19:57.640 --> 01:19:58.640]  they're coming.

[01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:09.280]  and I paid for this airtime because I have an important message to the
[01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:14.160]  American people. There's a change coming that the government isn't telling you
[01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:19.840]  about. This change has deep implications for life in America from where you
[01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:25.160]  shop to the doctors you visit and the family you want to protect. Look, I've
[01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:30.840]  made predictions like this before. Thing is, I was right then too. A few years
[01:21:30.840 --> 01:21:37.680]  ago I warned that housing prices would collapse. They did. Before that, I warned
[01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:44.360]  that dot-com companies would crash. They did. Those who listened had a chance to
[01:21:44.360 --> 01:21:48.600]  save themselves, but this has nothing to do with the stock market. This will
[01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:52.640]  affect us all. You can watch the video for free right now by going to

[01:24:02.480 --> 01:24:07.360]  By the way, I literally have over a hundred articles that are all incredibly
[01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:10.520]  important. I've got loaded phones and I'm just kind of screaming, they hate you,
[01:24:10.520 --> 01:24:14.760]  they hate your family, they hate your freedom. You know, Bush would say Al Qaeda
[01:24:14.760 --> 01:24:18.160]  attacked us because they had our freedoms while Bush and the Democrats
[01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:23.000]  with him were taking our freedoms. But in truth, the globalists do hate
[01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:28.920]  sovereign independent individuals. They want to conquer us, that's their will to
[01:24:28.920 --> 01:24:33.960]  power. And I'm just like Paul Revere up here, just screaming, the globalists are
[01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:40.960]  coming, the globalists are coming. To arms to arms in the Info War. Because they
[01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:46.360]  are activating national police forces, UN run, with the Justice Department to go
[01:24:46.360 --> 01:24:51.720]  after the Tea Party, they're already persecuting us. The entire Justice
[01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:55.800]  Department that's been involved, the IRS should be in prison. Nixon was removed
[01:24:55.800 --> 01:25:02.440]  from office for doing one one millionth, and I'm serious. He didn't even act on
[01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:07.440]  IRS persecution, he just had Lyft and was entertaining it. And they just do it at
[01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:12.280]  MSNBC, comes out and goes, I've got Rachel Maddow on tape. Of course we're going
[01:25:12.280 --> 01:25:18.040]  after the Tea Party, they're racist. Of course the IRS is going after you.
[01:25:18.040 --> 01:25:25.760]  I mean, they're just, of course we're gonna arrest you for a rebel flag. I mean, man,
[01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:33.680]  these people are dangerous. And I've never flown a rebel flag. If they can arrest
[01:25:33.680 --> 01:25:39.080]  you for a rebel flag, they can arrest you for anything people. This is beyond
[01:25:39.080 --> 01:25:48.400]  Soviet Union. They are arresting Germans by the hundreds. If they even
[01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:56.280]  criticize open borders and people being raped. The trash of the Middle East,
[01:25:56.280 --> 01:26:01.160]  their young military age men, criminals, are organizing and pouring into Europe.
[01:26:01.160 --> 01:26:06.480]  Sweden set up an airline to fly them in. Germans in towns of 3,000 have 4,000
[01:26:06.480 --> 01:26:10.200]  illegals delivered. They go to a city council and say, why are you doing this?
[01:26:10.200 --> 01:26:25.040]  And the governor says, leave. This is military. This is a takeover. And the poor
[01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:31.360]  Latin Americans pouring in are just pawns. They are not as criminal
[01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:35.240]  statistically as what's coming out of the Middle East and Europe. The difference
[01:26:35.240 --> 01:26:39.880]  is people do flee Latin America to come here and to have fake names. We are the
[01:26:39.880 --> 01:26:44.160]  Mexico of Latin America. It's like Americans run to Mexico because of no
[01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:53.120]  extradition. Criminals worldwide run here. And if you state that, well, you get
[01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:59.440]  put in Marvel Comics like I did as a racist that wants to kill immigrants.
[01:26:59.440 --> 01:27:09.480]  Remember a year and a half ago? Avengers 004 AR join the revolution. And then
[01:27:09.480 --> 01:27:13.440]  now they've got the new Captain America part of the Avengers fighting Red
[01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:20.800]  Skull. And who was Red Skull's main lieutenant? It's me. I can actually find
[01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:25.800]  it here. That's how they do it. That's what they do. Do you understand the
[01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:31.520]  level of that propaganda? Rob Jacobson ran in here and he said, you don't know
[01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:34.440]  about the new Superman. So I've got one of the reporters doing an article on it.
[01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:38.040]  And I said, no, he goes, well, the new ads started two days ago. It's all how
[01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:43.640]  Superman's an illegal alien. And again, folks, it's that it's every show, every
[01:27:43.640 --> 01:27:50.680]  program, unified propaganda. In fact, we have the trailer of that. They want
[01:27:50.680 --> 01:27:58.120]  Superman out because he's an illegal alien. Aliens are un-American. This is the
[01:27:58.120 --> 01:28:05.720]  ridiculousness. I saw an article on CNN yesterday. I'm going to bring it in. Is it
[01:28:05.720 --> 01:28:11.360]  ethical for humans to colonize Mars? And they basically say, even if there aren't
[01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:16.160]  live forms or advanced ones, aren't we kind of a scourge? Do we have a right to
[01:28:16.160 --> 01:28:22.000]  colonize Mars? Again, it's the unified that we're trash. They're saying we're the
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:28.200]  alien on earth. The globalists want to get rid of us. Hispanic, black, white,
[01:28:28.200 --> 01:28:34.320]  Asian, humans, humans, mixed, whatever. Humans are all mixing together. Humans are
[01:28:34.320 --> 01:28:38.320]  all coming together. We don't need to be told how we're racist all day. That's to
[01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:42.480]  make us hate each other. There's the article. Is it ethical to colonize Mars?
[01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:46.840]  The world after humans, humans of disease, humans of parasites, humans of
[01:28:46.840 --> 01:28:51.080]  cancer. You've heard it. They tell you how they hate you all day, how they hate me
[01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:55.400]  all day, how they hate our babies all day, and then they sit there and go, but we
[01:28:55.400 --> 01:28:59.960]  love all the immigrants and anyone that doesn't want an open border and the
[01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:05.000]  border patrols shipping people in and completing the smuggling process. It's
[01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:09.720]  just outrageous. So, you know, I'm going to do this next week. Buckley, Saturday,
[01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:17.240]  after two, I'm going in the evening, five o'clock, six o'clock, and I'm gonna meet
[01:29:17.240 --> 01:29:20.840]  people in a middle-class neighborhood. I'm gonna go to Terry Town, a liberal
[01:29:20.840 --> 01:29:25.240]  area, and I'm gonna knock on 50 doors with a handout, and I'm gonna say, with a
[01:29:25.240 --> 01:29:28.760]  camera, I don't care what they do, hi, I'm a migrant, and I'm gonna start trying to
[01:29:28.760 --> 01:29:32.600]  push my way in saying, I want dinner, I want you to give me money. Am I gonna
[01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:36.320]  threaten them? Well, they say, no, I'm gonna go, what do you mean? Give me your
[01:29:36.320 --> 01:29:42.520]  money, I'm a migrant racist. I'm going to do it because it's total mind control.
[01:29:42.520 --> 01:29:48.440]  It's crazy. I can't go to Guatemala and show up and demand free stuff. We're on
[01:29:48.440 --> 01:29:59.400]  the march. This is brainwashing. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network. This is Joe
[01:29:59.400 --> 01:30:05.000]  Biggs with infowars.com. Ammo control picks up stream among Democrats aiming
[01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:11.400]  to limit gun access. Article up at infowars.com with 300 million firearms in
[01:30:11.400 --> 01:30:15.960]  circulation and calls for more restrictions hitting a wall. Democrats
[01:30:15.960 --> 01:30:20.640]  and gun control advocates from California to Virginia are increasingly turning to
[01:30:20.640 --> 01:30:25.120]  other proposals such as restricting ammunition, magazine rounds, and
[01:30:25.120 --> 01:30:30.200]  narrowing the ability to wield weapons. California Lieutenant Governor Gavin
[01:30:30.200 --> 01:30:35.200]  Newsom, who was running for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in 2018,
[01:30:35.200 --> 01:30:40.520]  released a statewide ballot campaign Thursday to require background checks for
[01:30:40.520 --> 01:30:45.720]  ammunition purchases. Why is it that we have background checks for guns but not
[01:30:45.720 --> 01:30:49.840]  background checks for ammunition? It makes no sense, Mr. Newsom said at his
[01:30:49.840 --> 01:30:54.360]  press conference. Well, because it's ammunition, you a** clown. You can find
[01:30:54.360 --> 01:31:18.360]  more articles like this at infowars.com.

[01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:08.240]  You walk into this room at your own risk because it leads to the future. Not a
[01:33:08.240 --> 01:33:14.360]  future that will be but one that might be. This is not a new world. It is simply
[01:33:14.360 --> 01:33:19.800]  an extension of what began in the old one. It has patterned itself after every
[01:33:19.800 --> 01:33:23.680]  dictator who has ever planted the ripping imprint of a boot on the pages of
[01:33:23.680 --> 01:33:29.560]  history since the beginning of time. It has refinements, technological advances
[01:33:29.560 --> 01:33:35.000]  and a more sophisticated approach to the destruction of human freedom. But like
[01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:40.800]  every one of the super states that preceded it, it has one iron rule. Logic
[01:33:40.800 --> 01:33:51.760]  is an enemy and truth is a menace. This is Mr. Romney Wordsworth in his last 48
[01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:56.520]  hours on earth. He's a citizen of the state but will soon have to be eliminated
[01:33:56.520 --> 01:34:02.760]  because he is built out of flesh and because he has a mind. Mr. Romney
[01:34:02.760 --> 01:34:11.080]  Wordsworth who will draw his last breaths in the twilight zone.
[01:34:11.080 --> 01:34:16.080]  You're listening to and you're watching the Alex Jones show. We're here live 11 a.m.
[01:34:16.080 --> 01:34:22.360]  to 3 p.m. now. We have a fourth hour now added that will be hosted by David Knight
[01:34:22.360 --> 01:34:26.520]  today. I know he's got a big broadcast lined up in the fourth hour. He'll be
[01:34:26.520 --> 01:34:31.280]  joining us for about five six minutes at 24 after next hour to give us an update
[01:34:31.280 --> 01:34:35.700]  on some of what he's going to be breaking down. I want to go to your calls
[01:34:35.700 --> 01:34:44.480]  Jason, Rader, Ron, Tara, John and others. The toll free number to join us is 800-25-99231.
[01:34:44.480 --> 01:34:52.520]  That right take ten calls or so. I'm going to launch into the over-the-top news.
[01:34:52.520 --> 01:34:55.840]  Russia may fire missiles at Syrian militants from Mediterranean Sea
[01:34:55.840 --> 01:34:59.520]  officials say Turkey downs drone over Syrian border and Russian tensions.
[01:34:59.520 --> 01:35:03.880]  China says military will stand up and use force of U.S. since warships to the
[01:35:03.880 --> 01:35:08.880]  islands. Period. Threats of war with China. ISIS in retreat as Russia destroys
[01:35:08.880 --> 01:35:14.520]  32 targets while Putin trolls Obama as weak with no strategy. Russia Iran began
[01:35:14.520 --> 01:35:20.160]  promised assault on Syria's largest city and final bid to restore Assad. Iran ramps
[01:35:20.160 --> 01:35:25.360]  up trip deployment in Syria in run-up to anti rebel offensive. Al Qaeda in Syria
[01:35:25.360 --> 01:35:30.520]  leader kills, says kill the entire Alawite minority killed the Christians.
[01:35:30.520 --> 01:35:35.160]  Unbelievable statements. So that's just some of the news there we're going to be
[01:35:35.160 --> 01:35:41.360]  covering. Merkel faces domestic revolt over refugee welcome. Russia tried to cut
[01:35:41.360 --> 01:35:45.180]  off the worldwide web. Yes they're testing internet kill switch and the
[01:35:45.180 --> 01:35:49.960]  Guardian and the Telegraph and others act like this is so incredibly evil. Well
[01:35:49.960 --> 01:35:53.560]  I mean I agree that internet kill switch are only allowing state-run media is
[01:35:53.560 --> 01:35:57.240]  very draconian and Russia is totalitarian to a certain extent and I
[01:35:57.240 --> 01:36:01.480]  don't like it. But you know the United States had a kill switch and they
[01:36:01.480 --> 01:36:05.360]  admitted about seven years ago and now they call it the Obama kill switch and
[01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:10.560]  it's fully in place to only send you White House messages on cable TV radio
[01:36:10.560 --> 01:36:15.120]  internet anytime they want. And now you notice they're forcing your phone to turn
[01:36:15.120 --> 01:36:19.040]  on and give you alerts. Some people are getting videos from the president now
[01:36:19.040 --> 01:36:24.080]  forced emails when you're not on their email list they're slowly testing the
[01:36:24.080 --> 01:36:29.320]  waters to have media takeover and it's bad of the US does it bad of Russia
[01:36:29.320 --> 01:36:35.480]  does it. They'll go there's a lot of state-run media in Russia. State-run ABC
[01:36:35.480 --> 01:36:42.720]  CBS NBC I mean that stuff is admittedly run by psych warfare people and it's not
[01:36:42.720 --> 01:36:47.520]  run by the general Pentagon or CIA they have weird leftist social engineering
[01:36:47.520 --> 01:36:53.520]  nest that that are at the top who basically write the Hollywood scripts
[01:36:53.520 --> 01:36:58.440]  they write basic templates and then they just regurgitate them out on every
[01:36:58.440 --> 01:37:04.240]  platform and it's truly sickening. I mean you like going to see in Hollywood
[01:37:04.240 --> 01:37:08.680]  movies where they just brainwash you? You like being a victim of them laughing at
[01:37:08.680 --> 01:37:14.920]  you? I mean this is sick and I'm trying to not get mad here but I mean this is
[01:37:14.920 --> 01:37:21.280]  ridiculous. Shame on Hollywood shame on the CIA shame on the Justice Department
[01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:25.680]  I mean look I know your anti-American crooks at the top who are parasites that
[01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:29.760]  live off us and everybody knows whether it's a spoiled rotten kid or spoiled
[01:37:29.760 --> 01:37:34.280]  rotten employees or whatever that when you let people get spoiled rotten and
[01:37:34.280 --> 01:37:38.560]  live off of you they end up becoming your masters and disdaining who feeds
[01:37:38.560 --> 01:37:45.200]  them that's well known you got punk kids you spoil they'll be 18 beating you up
[01:37:45.200 --> 01:37:49.720]  demanding more money and grabbing out of your purse because they were never
[01:37:49.720 --> 01:37:54.280]  disciplined and we've got a bunch of people that actually believe that's
[01:37:54.280 --> 01:37:59.440]  sucking blood out of us isn't enough they want to kill the golden goose as an
[01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:08.240]  active power bunch of spoiled rotten scum here's the good news filth Congress
[01:38:08.240 --> 01:38:12.280]  has a nine percent approval rating we focused our attention on Monsanto and
[01:38:12.280 --> 01:38:18.840]  on Walmart and on other enemy operators
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:23.960]  McDonald's and they're already in freefall and I'm gonna tell you something
[01:38:23.960 --> 01:38:27.960]  Disney you better try to go do state-run media for China you better try to get

[01:42:55.800 --> 01:43:00.040]  just cannot believe that they harvest millions of babies and even try to keep
[01:43:00.040 --> 01:43:04.120]  them alive a few days so they can harvest them properly and China keeps
[01:43:04.120 --> 01:43:07.200]  people alive and takes part of the organs and keeps them alive months in
[01:43:07.200 --> 01:43:11.080]  some cases ripping them out and our media criticizes you if you're against

[01:43:14.480 --> 01:43:17.800]  running things are bloodthirsty and hate us and don't have good will for us I
[01:43:17.800 --> 01:43:23.480]  mean this is crazy and then I flipped out yesterday because they're announcing a
[01:43:23.480 --> 01:43:27.800]  new Justice Department mega unit with their number one national directive to
[01:43:27.800 --> 01:43:32.240]  go after conservatives and veterans and libertarians and gun owners they're
[01:43:32.240 --> 01:43:36.160]  announcing all this executive gun grabbing outside of law and they're
[01:43:36.160 --> 01:43:39.280]  announcing they believe the Tea Party's gonna start blowing stuff up any minute
[01:43:39.280 --> 01:43:44.040]  while they persecute people illegally and I just know full well what these
[01:43:44.040 --> 01:43:48.920]  scum are gonna pull I mean do people at the Justice Department really want to
[01:43:48.920 --> 01:43:52.520]  be involved in more false flags you really like blowing up daycare centers
[01:43:52.520 --> 01:43:56.840]  and whaming it on the states they were about to have a states rights movement
[01:43:56.840 --> 01:44:02.440]  to get out of the UN in globalism in 1994 95 Oklahoma was leading a state
[01:44:02.440 --> 01:44:07.920]  coalition of 27 states to do it and so they blew up the federal building and
[01:44:07.920 --> 01:44:11.600]  blamed it on the Patriots and I'm telling you that's the kind of crap they're
[01:44:11.600 --> 01:44:18.120]  gonna pull and what is even Steven Segal say it's up on info wars.com I believe
[01:44:18.120 --> 01:44:22.800]  in the Second Amendment and I believe a lot of these mass murders going on that
[01:44:22.800 --> 01:44:28.400]  a lot of these are engineered I don't know they had Al Qaeda launched two
[01:44:28.400 --> 01:44:34.760]  chemical attacks on Assad and film it and post it bragging screaming Allah
[01:44:34.760 --> 01:44:43.200]  Akbar and they still blamed the Syrian government they wouldn't do anything
[01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:46.680]  like that here I mean they'd they'd abort 55 million babies they keep babies
[01:44:46.680 --> 01:44:50.560]  alive and sell their body parts and we have videos of eight-month-old seven-

[01:45:20.760 --> 01:45:27.600]  tested Bolshevik communism in 1917 in Russia it killed 50 million people
[01:45:27.600 --> 01:45:34.520]  conservatively they put Mao in in 49 that's declassified the CIA put Mao in
[01:45:34.520 --> 01:45:38.920]  that killed 84 million people they then as a counter to it created Nazi
[01:45:38.920 --> 01:45:46.080]  fascism as a scientific test to see what that would do you understand that the
[01:45:46.080 --> 01:45:51.200]  United States in England gave birth to communism and Nazism so while you're

[01:54:23.040 --> 01:54:28.280]  just other stuff that illustrates how Obama says that Africans shouldn't be
[01:54:28.280 --> 01:54:32.680]  able to have vacations cars air conditioning standard of living but
[01:54:32.680 --> 01:54:37.400]  then he spent 4.4 million on a golf course and private fundraisers in the
[01:54:37.400 --> 01:54:42.360]  last two months alone taxpayer money totally illegal by the way you're not
[01:54:42.360 --> 01:54:46.840]  supposed to do all that with taxpayer money but don't worry they've indicted
[01:54:46.840 --> 01:54:53.000]  and are now trying to run Paul's chief people for giving money to other
[01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.920]  libertarians who are running for office and then those people endorse them
[01:54:55.920 --> 01:55:03.600]  claiming that was a paid endorsement it's just all how you phrase something it
[01:55:03.600 --> 01:55:07.640]  is illegal to run for state or federal office in America the way the laws are
[01:55:07.640 --> 01:55:15.080]  read they could indict a piece of lemon pie for murder for just sitting on a
[01:55:15.080 --> 01:55:20.880]  table I mean they can do whatever they want it's total joke and the government
[01:55:20.880 --> 01:55:25.200]  is discredited it is illegitimate Hillary can take billions from foreign
[01:55:25.200 --> 01:55:28.520]  governments to her foundation to ship them weapons at the State Department
[01:55:28.520 --> 01:55:37.360]  publicly ripping everyone off in giant organized crime nakedly and it's okay but
[01:55:37.360 --> 01:55:41.840]  the Texas Attorney General at dinner before he was Attorney General told
[01:55:41.840 --> 01:55:44.400]  people he thought was a good investment even though he hadn't been an
[01:55:44.400 --> 01:55:49.280]  investment trader for over two years he just told them what he thought was a
[01:55:49.280 --> 01:55:54.320]  good investment and they've indicted him because he didn't register anymore
[01:55:54.320 --> 01:55:57.440]  oh you weren't registered anymore you said this was a good investment we're
[01:55:57.440 --> 01:56:05.560]  going to indict you because you're fighting Obama they're making their
[01:56:05.560 --> 01:56:10.600]  criminal move let's go to your calls Jason in Texas Jason you're on the
[01:56:10.600 --> 01:56:15.200]  air thanks for calling hey Alex today I wanted to talk about Admiralty
[01:56:15.200 --> 01:56:19.360]  jurisdiction and something that most Americans don't actually understand is
[01:56:19.360 --> 01:56:22.480]  that the Constitution Article 3 section 2 provides for three separate
[01:56:22.480 --> 01:56:26.560]  jurisdictions which are law equity and Admiralty so for listeners that aren't
[01:56:26.560 --> 01:56:30.240]  aware common law or common law is what the nation was founded upon that goes
[01:56:30.240 --> 01:56:34.040]  back to the Magna Carta and it's really simple don't injure don't harm others
[01:56:34.040 --> 01:56:37.760]  or their property and don't use fraud in your contracts any crimes committed
[01:56:37.760 --> 01:56:41.320]  under the common law require there to be a corpus delectee or an injured party
[01:56:41.320 --> 01:56:45.520]  equity is a jurisdiction of contracts and doesn't encompass criminal activities
[01:56:45.520 --> 01:56:48.880]  and finally we have Admiralty jurisdiction which is the law of the
[01:56:48.880 --> 01:56:52.540]  military and the high feet so for example a soldier that refuses to peel
[01:56:52.540 --> 01:56:56.360]  potatoes when ordered is a criminal act even if there is no injured party now
[01:56:56.360 --> 01:56:59.520]  it's under Admiralty jurisdiction that the United States citizens are
[01:56:59.520 --> 01:57:04.680]  criminally prosecuted operated at sea or under wartime emergencies if you were
[01:57:04.680 --> 01:57:07.800]  in the military and did not have a jurisdiction over the general public
[01:57:07.800 --> 01:57:11.960]  but through fraud and contract fraud getting us to opt into Admiralty it's
[01:57:11.960 --> 01:57:16.280]  been brought in now to be one of the dominant forms of law as we move into
[01:57:16.280 --> 01:57:20.720]  administrative exactly it's been done with our silent consent and it's the
[01:57:20.720 --> 01:57:23.760]  extension of this Admiralty jurisdiction to the colonists it was actually one of
[01:57:23.760 --> 01:57:27.240]  the prime reasons behind the revolution so almost every court in the United
[01:57:27.240 --> 01:57:31.160]  States today the jurisdiction is assumed yes number one was them trying to take
[01:57:31.160 --> 01:57:35.600]  the guns but number two was British press kings grabbing people's eight nine
[01:57:35.600 --> 01:57:39.800]  ten-year-old boys off their front porches or from school or from the
[01:57:39.800 --> 01:57:45.280]  fields and taking them to be slaves on British ships now what you can't do is
[01:57:45.280 --> 01:57:49.040]  you can't a licensed attorney can't actually go into court and make this
[01:57:49.040 --> 01:57:52.440]  kind of jurisdictional challenge because they've already consented to being part
[01:57:52.440 --> 01:57:56.920]  of this now I've had I've not found that I've got really great lawyers and they
[01:57:56.920 --> 01:58:02.120]  routinely cite common law precedent and are successful in court and I
[01:58:02.120 --> 01:58:05.680]  actually did that pretty recently to get a minor traffic fence thrown out and
[01:58:05.680 --> 01:58:09.000]  that was a that was pretty rewarding now some of the listeners might ask you know
[01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:12.520]  how did we get here I didn't consent to being under military rule and but as you
[01:58:12.520 --> 01:58:15.800]  mentioned we've basically we've passively agreed to this to this
[01:58:15.800 --> 01:58:18.840]  jurisdiction pretty much all the municipal governments are corporate
[01:58:18.840 --> 01:58:22.000]  entities the incorporated city of Austin the incorporated state of Texas the
[01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:26.280]  incorporated district of Columbia and yes the incorporated United States we
[01:58:26.280 --> 01:58:29.440]  agree become trustees and their corporations listen I agree with you
[01:58:29.440 --> 01:58:33.520]  that's how they set up the fraud stay there I'm gonna come back to you but now
[01:58:33.520 --> 01:58:36.600]  it's gone to the force of a barrel of a gun they don't even operate in that now

[01:59:55.320 --> 02:00:11.760]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[02:00:11.760 --> 02:00:19.280]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[02:00:19.280 --> 02:00:25.520]  Alex Jones I'm not trying to run over Jason I'm just backing up what he's saying
[02:00:25.520 --> 02:00:29.440]  the truth is the three forms of law you're talking about being integrated
[02:00:29.440 --> 02:00:37.360]  together can you put different names on them the system basically operates in
[02:00:37.360 --> 02:00:41.960]  all three but now they're just creating totally made-up memos in the federal
[02:00:41.960 --> 02:00:45.680]  government where they say we can secretly arrest you we can torture you we
[02:00:45.680 --> 02:00:50.280]  can deal drugs if we want because we're God it's now just reached Hitlerian
[02:00:50.280 --> 02:00:56.560]  totalitarian levels where it's not even based in any form of law it's just total
[02:00:56.560 --> 02:01:01.240]  garbage and they do it by increment they do it by practice so they would kind of
[02:01:01.240 --> 02:01:05.840]  argue that it's common law that if they can commonly operate a tyranny it
[02:01:05.840 --> 02:01:11.320]  becomes a taking I don't claim to be a lawyer but I can sit around constitutional
[02:01:11.320 --> 02:01:15.280]  lawyers litigators top lawyers and they say wow you want to be a lawyer you're
[02:01:15.280 --> 02:01:18.600]  more a lot knowledgeable than most lawyers and I'm just knowledgeable in the
[02:01:18.600 --> 02:01:24.880]  general execution of law throughout history and some of the different systems
[02:01:24.880 --> 02:01:29.760]  of law that they've had but I don't want to get off into a treatise on law what
[02:01:29.760 --> 02:01:33.600]  was your final point there Jason I'm gonna go to Ron Tara John truth writer
[02:01:33.600 --> 02:01:38.200]  and others basically that we've just agreed to become trustees in their in
[02:01:38.200 --> 02:01:41.440]  their municipal corporations in their governmental bodies we sacrifice our
[02:01:41.440 --> 02:01:44.440]  inherent rights for the privileges and immunities you know we find our social
[02:01:44.440 --> 02:01:48.320]  security contract we sign our driver's license as we accept the benefits in
[02:01:48.320 --> 02:01:51.920]  welfare unemployment we go see Disney movies when Disney's sworn to destroy
[02:01:51.920 --> 02:01:56.600]  the family in the country so and I guess fine the last thing I have to say is
[02:01:56.600 --> 02:02:00.880]  about these so-called sovereign citizens which really is an oxymoron you know
[02:02:00.880 --> 02:02:04.040]  that most of these sovereign citizens are still accepting you know that some of
[02:02:04.040 --> 02:02:08.520]  the privileges of being part of this system yeah I mean not all of them but
[02:02:08.520 --> 02:02:11.880]  a lot of them use it like they're getting ahead on somebody or they sue
[02:02:11.880 --> 02:02:14.640]  their neighbors not all not a lot of them but some of them are really nasty
[02:02:14.640 --> 02:02:19.160]  some of them do make stuff up some of them do engage in fraud I've had to deal
[02:02:19.160 --> 02:02:23.000]  with some of it myself but then they discredit the legitimate process people
[02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:27.440]  go ahead if we want to become true sovereigns we have to learn to step out
[02:02:27.440 --> 02:02:31.520]  of the system entirely I don't know how possible that is anymore but you know
[02:02:31.520 --> 02:02:34.240]  learning to produce our own food learning to trade on our own terms with
[02:02:34.240 --> 02:02:38.200]  Bitcoin with gold with silver and exiting this United States dollar you
[02:02:38.200 --> 02:02:42.120]  know these federal reserve notes well I agree with you that I mean it's
[02:02:42.120 --> 02:02:46.600]  absolutely essential to vote with your dollars every way you can and try to not
[02:02:46.600 --> 02:02:52.440]  shop with the New World Order and also criticize them talk bad about them just
[02:02:52.440 --> 02:02:59.160]  just they're nasty all these big major corporations Monsanto Disney Time Warner
[02:02:59.160 --> 02:03:02.920]  all of them and sometimes you know we got Time Warner as a backup here we've
[02:03:02.920 --> 02:03:06.760]  got to have three forms of internet that's what's available that's what we've
[02:03:06.760 --> 02:03:12.920]  got so sometimes it's essential to to to weigh it you know do I work with this
[02:03:12.920 --> 02:03:18.000]  enemy so that I can attack them through their own system and and so I do I
[02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:22.040]  really appreciate your call I mean it'd be like if you were fighting in a foreign
[02:03:22.040 --> 02:03:25.560]  war and you're out of ammo and you capture some of the enemy's rifles and
[02:03:25.560 --> 02:03:29.600]  ammo I mean is it traitorous to use their weapons against them no if I got
[02:03:29.600 --> 02:03:32.800]  tanks coming over me and I'm out of ammo and I've just killed a couple enemy
[02:03:32.800 --> 02:03:36.040]  soldiers and they've got rocket launchers laying there you know phosphorus
[02:03:36.040 --> 02:03:41.320]  tipped anti-tank weapons I'm gonna use them and before I go into battle I'm
[02:03:41.320 --> 02:03:44.560]  gonna try to know what the enemy's weapon systems are so that I can use them
[02:03:44.560 --> 02:03:48.280]  against them well that's what I do I don't know how to use a phosphorus tipped
[02:03:48.280 --> 02:03:53.120]  anti-tank weapon actually I do but the pins on the model other little research
[02:03:53.120 --> 02:03:57.120]  this is interesting but I do know how to use Facebook and Twitter and YouTube I
[02:03:57.120 --> 02:04:01.960]  do know how to use their own systems against them and I will use it against
[02:04:01.960 --> 02:04:05.520]  them I will attack them with the truth because they attack the innocence they
[02:04:05.520 --> 02:04:10.360]  are attacking everyone and I know what crazed sworn enemies they are of our
[02:04:10.360 --> 02:04:17.360]  families absolutely sworn to destroy us and their average employee is not bad
[02:04:17.360 --> 02:04:23.160]  at Microsoft at Google at these companies in fact that's why we are so
[02:04:23.160 --> 02:04:28.760]  successful because we're just naked we're bare bones in the trenches like cavemen
[02:04:28.760 --> 02:04:33.240]  foaming at the mouth we're under attack we know it and we're going crazy and
[02:04:33.240 --> 02:04:37.160]  pure other humans understand we're telling the truth they know the truth
[02:04:37.160 --> 02:04:40.400]  they know they're just surviving working for the enemy we don't blame them we
[02:04:40.400 --> 02:04:44.760]  understand just get the intel out build your own systems with the money you get
[02:04:44.760 --> 02:04:49.000]  from the enemy and just work with others to build parallel programs and just
[02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:52.680]  pray for the fall of the New World Order and pray that they bleed out of their
[02:04:52.680 --> 02:04:57.920]  eyes and that they rot in hell forever we'll be back

[02:08:17.800 --> 02:08:23.080]  it was Howard Beale the fictional character in the 1970s hit film network
[02:08:23.080 --> 02:08:28.200]  Robert Duvall that said I don't know what all the answers are but first I
[02:08:28.200 --> 02:08:33.200]  know you've got to get mad well so I'm a human being my life has value and that's
[02:08:33.200 --> 02:08:36.560]  the point I've gotten to is I get a little upset about this I get way upset
[02:08:36.560 --> 02:08:40.360]  sometimes start blowing up we're going to your phone calls right now I mentioned
[02:08:40.360 --> 02:08:43.660]  this back in the last hour so they brought it in from the new American
[02:08:43.660 --> 02:08:49.200]  magazine and it links to a whole bunch of international UN documents Harvard
[02:08:49.200 --> 02:08:56.360]  you name it that blacks suffer most from fluoride but fluoridate anyway and then
[02:08:56.360 --> 02:09:01.160]  it gets into the studies that it's at least double bad for cancer IQ loss
[02:09:01.160 --> 02:09:07.480]  heart problems I mean fluoride for black people is it is really bad and that's
[02:09:07.480 --> 02:09:12.680]  because the average black person on average has higher hormone levels of a
[02:09:12.680 --> 02:09:19.640]  bunch of key endocrine's and you had fluoride into that it is a really nasty mix
[02:09:19.640 --> 02:09:24.280]  so there you go I'll tell you about that you're not gonna hear the n-double xcp
[02:09:24.280 --> 02:09:27.520]  talk about the number one health threat to black people in the country and why
[02:09:27.520 --> 02:09:31.920]  they've got much higher levels of heart disease and so many other things just you
[02:09:31.920 --> 02:09:35.480]  know let's just not worry about that let's just size I mean who needs to

[02:10:03.600 --> 02:10:08.800]  admit all my kids sometimes think that I'm a wacko but you know what they're
[02:10:08.800 --> 02:10:12.960]  you know we are wackos we are wackos living in this insane asylum it's not
[02:10:12.960 --> 02:10:18.880]  normal to go along with this go ahead sorry it it yeah no I hear you listen
[02:10:18.880 --> 02:10:24.480]  first of all I want to thank you for being the voice that you are I think
[02:10:24.480 --> 02:10:31.400]  there needs to be a lot more of you of us I think that that people do need to
[02:10:31.400 --> 02:10:35.680]  wake up and and and be encouraged to you know kind of follow suit with what
[02:10:35.680 --> 02:10:39.800]  you're doing because we we do live in a matrix I have to tell you real quickly I
[02:10:39.800 --> 02:10:45.400]  listen when Matt drudge was on your show and he said something to the tune of
[02:10:45.400 --> 02:10:50.440]  creating your own reality within the internet and within this matrix and I'll
[02:10:50.440 --> 02:10:53.800]  tell you something about that really really resonated with me
[02:10:53.800 --> 02:11:00.040]  unfortunately I'm like a lot of Americans where I'm trying to connect the
[02:11:00.040 --> 02:11:03.960]  dots I'm not really in the know you know I'm not one of these one percenters I'm
[02:11:03.960 --> 02:11:09.240]  not a glow list that has access to all this information and I'm not a journalist
[02:11:09.240 --> 02:11:13.960]  or a reporter again that has access to your busy providing for your family and
[02:11:13.960 --> 02:11:18.520]  jumping through all the red tape which is what they've decided to do yes sir yeah
[02:11:18.520 --> 02:11:23.200]  so you know I live in I live in Bonham I live it close to the Red River this
[02:11:23.200 --> 02:11:29.080]  being a BLM deal that's going on with that land grab you know hits close to home
[02:11:29.080 --> 02:11:33.880]  and listen here's here's what happened yesterday so I'm listening to your
[02:11:33.880 --> 02:11:38.800]  program it's the middle of the day I had a day off I thought you know what I'm
[02:11:38.800 --> 02:11:43.760]  gonna take a nap like anything I thought let me I've just started googling your
[02:11:43.760 --> 02:11:48.320]  name you know because I enjoy your show and I'm very intrigued with what you do
[02:11:48.320 --> 02:11:52.360]  and and I thought well I'll just get a little bit more information and boom out
[02:11:52.360 --> 02:11:58.640]  of nowhere I read this article that says that you're a Freemason now let me
[02:11:58.640 --> 02:12:03.760]  let me first of all say that I haven't met a Freemason that I haven't liked
[02:12:03.760 --> 02:12:12.240]  but for years I've had a concern and my mother is married to a Freemason and
[02:12:12.240 --> 02:12:17.320]  and this guy is again you know I enjoy his company but I'm always digging for
[02:12:17.320 --> 02:12:21.360]  information and trying to gather things getting them to slip so that you know I
[02:12:21.360 --> 02:12:27.160]  can try to educate myself around around things but ultimately the other day he
[02:12:27.160 --> 02:12:32.440]  said are you ever gonna join which really is ironic because you know they
[02:12:32.440 --> 02:12:36.360]  don't invite people to and I'm not but flat out told them I said Jesse here's
[02:12:36.360 --> 02:12:39.720]  the deal I'm not gonna join and I'll tell you why
[02:12:39.720 --> 02:12:49.560]  Freemasons are are at the head of every global organization there is and I and I
[02:12:49.560 --> 02:12:54.840]  hear I've heard and hear that you guys do wonderful things I'm sure that you do
[02:12:54.840 --> 02:13:01.280]  however how can this world be in the condition that it's in if you guys are
[02:13:01.280 --> 02:13:07.120]  at the top of politics I think you made I think you've made two really great
[02:13:07.120 --> 02:13:11.280]  points let me try to respond to those we'll put you on hold for a moment come
[02:13:11.280 --> 02:13:15.000]  back let you have a response that I can go to Tara John and others first let me
[02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:21.000]  cover the Matt Drudge point it takes all sorts of people to beat this thing I am
[02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:25.920]  being honest I'm really acting the way I feel I'm embarrassed sometimes I blow up
[02:13:25.920 --> 02:13:29.320]  but quite frankly it's made a successful because it gets people out of their
[02:13:29.320 --> 02:13:34.800]  trance it turns on more people than it turns them off and I don't mind being
[02:13:34.800 --> 02:13:38.280]  ridiculed and attack my shelf because it doesn't matter the message gets out
[02:13:38.280 --> 02:13:43.040]  people find out about it and the message is there people then research it for
[02:13:43.040 --> 02:13:49.080]  themselves and find out it's true and so then it's separate from Alex being
[02:13:49.080 --> 02:13:54.120]  laughed at it doesn't matter I've carried the message I've got it across the
[02:13:54.120 --> 02:14:00.120]  goal line now drudge talks about creating your own system your own outlook
[02:14:00.120 --> 02:14:04.360]  that comes from the grassroots that will then become popular because the
[02:14:04.360 --> 02:14:09.880]  establishment narrative is so synthetic and so fake people are breaking with it
[02:14:09.880 --> 02:14:13.880]  so the answer is don't just believe in drudge don't just believe in info wars
[02:14:13.880 --> 02:14:16.880]  don't just believe in world net daily or whatever it is you're into that's more
[02:14:16.880 --> 02:14:21.800]  libertarian conservative go out and create your own system the average
[02:14:21.800 --> 02:14:25.400]  Democrats not even a bad person they're led by very bad people if they went out
[02:14:25.400 --> 02:14:28.440]  and created their own system it'd be a lot better than what the Democrats are
[02:14:28.440 --> 02:14:34.040]  putting out be a true individual transmit that message create your own
[02:14:34.040 --> 02:14:38.920]  paradigm based on the real reality you see don't be delusional get out of the
[02:14:38.920 --> 02:14:44.240]  delusion of the system really research it now I get you say you're not an expert
[02:14:44.240 --> 02:14:47.120]  cuz you're not in the new world order not a mason you're not whatever you're a
[02:14:47.120 --> 02:14:50.240]  real expert you're a father you're a business person you live in the real
[02:14:50.240 --> 02:14:55.240]  world you're watching the BLM take all these ranchers land some of its 60%
[02:14:55.240 --> 02:15:00.360]  some of 50% that they've had for 79 years 104 years the different families
[02:15:00.360 --> 02:15:03.560]  that we've interviewed and had on I want to get that latest family on by the way
[02:15:03.560 --> 02:15:08.760]  guys and they're just announcing we're taking your house built 70 plus years
[02:15:08.760 --> 02:15:12.760]  ago and we're taking half your property thousands of acres we're moving you know
[02:15:12.760 --> 02:15:20.160]  the barrier of the river a mile in it's total theft and they're saying every
[02:15:20.160 --> 02:15:23.600]  river every creek if we want we're gonna just take your property it's a
[02:15:23.600 --> 02:15:29.360]  precedent setter it's part of a UN treaty it's UNESCO so what was that
[02:15:29.360 --> 02:15:34.440]  guys oh you do have the BLM video well everybody knows about it I mean I may
[02:15:34.440 --> 02:15:38.560]  plant I want to go to calls but thanks for reminding me they talk a mayor now
[02:15:38.560 --> 02:15:42.960]  that was on NBC Fox News you name it it's up on them for wars.com Texas Rancher
[02:15:42.960 --> 02:15:46.480]  fights back against BLM land grab so yeah that comes close to home for you
[02:15:46.480 --> 02:15:51.360]  you're seeing it for yourself that's what they did to Clive and Bundy he had
[02:15:51.360 --> 02:15:55.000]  the rights to his land they just said it's not yours and lie to the public he
[02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:59.120]  had grazing rights though for a hundred plus years this is where they own the
[02:15:59.120 --> 02:16:08.080]  actual title and have paid taxes so you get into your whole mason point next you
[02:16:08.080 --> 02:16:14.920]  know I have to probably say that I have major masonic roots I have never been
[02:16:14.920 --> 02:16:20.600]  part of a masonic lodge I've never taken masonic oaths or rituals a lot of my
[02:16:20.600 --> 02:16:26.840]  family Texas was pretty much masonic through and through was masonic high
[02:16:26.840 --> 02:16:30.400]  level masonic and they were very very good people George Washington was a
[02:16:30.400 --> 02:16:35.880]  mason I have been interviewed by major TV shows on history discovery channel
[02:16:35.880 --> 02:16:43.840]  you name it about my view on masonic orders it really is next to impossible
[02:16:43.840 --> 02:16:50.160]  to try to describe masons and the masonic orders and the different
[02:16:50.160 --> 02:16:57.640]  systems when I've probably read I don't want to exaggerate 20 books on it
[02:16:57.640 --> 02:17:01.440]  that's not that much and hundreds of white papers and talk to a lot of top
[02:17:01.440 --> 02:17:08.880]  masons and I know more than most masons do most masons are porch masons and are
[02:17:08.880 --> 02:17:13.560]  compartmentalized and don't know really much of anything they know about
[02:17:13.560 --> 02:17:21.440]  Solomon and basically a bunch of ancient history stuff University knowledge was
[02:17:21.440 --> 02:17:25.760]  very powerful mathematics was very powerful was associated with magic with
[02:17:25.760 --> 02:17:33.680]  the occult pre Christ pre-Abraham so it's the old-time religion and all it is
[02:17:33.680 --> 02:17:39.200]  is a university study of religions of philosophy and of building and of
[02:17:39.200 --> 02:17:44.080]  mathematics and of agrarian systems because they didn't just bring anybody
[02:17:44.080 --> 02:17:48.720]  in to teach them the knowledge of warfare the knowledge of science the
[02:17:48.720 --> 02:17:53.120]  knowledge of culture universities were called mystery schools going back to
[02:17:53.120 --> 02:18:00.320]  Egypt basically and so what you see is masons today is just those schools going
[02:18:00.320 --> 02:18:04.760]  on and there have been hundreds of different variants and groups and
[02:18:04.760 --> 02:18:11.800]  Rosicrucian orders within the masons and the Illuminati founded in Germany was
[02:18:11.800 --> 02:18:16.840]  a counter Illuminati to the real Illuminati that was just called itself
[02:18:16.840 --> 02:18:20.840]  the Enlightenment and then in Latin Illuminati but it didn't call itself
[02:18:20.840 --> 02:18:26.240]  Sir Francis Bacon all of that hundreds of years before the Jesuit priest Adam
[02:18:26.240 --> 02:18:31.920]  Visop the modern Illuminati was a Catholic spinoff in an attempt to take over
[02:18:31.920 --> 02:18:37.720]  the Illuminati and the Rosicrucians and and yes undoubtedly my family on both
[02:18:37.720 --> 02:18:41.800]  sides on the Mayflower hardcore Protestants you could say Rosicrucians
[02:18:41.800 --> 02:18:46.120]  this country was founded by real Rosicrucians not the Rosicrucians you see
[02:18:46.120 --> 02:18:52.440]  out there today and so undoubtedly if you want to say it I mean I would say I
[02:18:52.440 --> 02:18:58.240]  come out of a classical Enlightenment family of what you would call real
[02:18:58.240 --> 02:19:02.880]  Illuminati real Enlightenment and I'll just say it here everybody ask me who I
[02:19:02.880 --> 02:19:07.040]  am I'll tell you there's no secret society there's no secret messages there's
[02:19:07.040 --> 02:19:12.120]  no secret handshakes there's freedom there's Jesus Christ there's free market
[02:19:12.120 --> 02:19:16.280]  there's family there's strength there's honor there's the will to fight tyrants
[02:19:16.280 --> 02:19:20.480]  that's what there is the will to fight evil the will to build a new
[02:19:20.480 --> 02:19:25.880]  civilization built on honor built on trust built on building up a system for
[02:19:25.880 --> 02:19:31.240]  all of humanity and that that secret was not a secret at all and it made this
[02:19:31.240 --> 02:19:37.800]  country special to spite all our evils the will and the dream to build that new
[02:19:37.800 --> 02:19:42.160]  Atlantis was special and was pure and now the globalists have hijacked the new
[02:19:42.160 --> 02:19:46.360]  Atlantis and they've used it to take over the world and sell the opposite of
[02:19:46.360 --> 02:19:51.320]  what this country was founded on and it tears my heart out so it's easy for
[02:19:51.320 --> 02:19:54.960]  lesser men to write an article claiming I'm in some secret society in a mason
[02:19:54.960 --> 02:20:00.320]  I'm in the society of humanity there are no secrets there are hundreds of silver

[02:24:17.600 --> 02:24:24.200]  to pop in with some breaking news on this hologram situation in China in fact I
[02:24:24.200 --> 02:24:29.040]  had that in my stack but I can't find it here it is I found it so we're gonna do
[02:24:29.040 --> 02:24:32.360]  that but Ron you got about 30 seconds to respond as I got to go to Tara John and
[02:24:32.360 --> 02:24:38.720]  others go ahead real quickly my mom's Mexican my dad's Jewish so Shalom but
[02:24:38.720 --> 02:24:43.400]  though I need to know what's going on with the rise in terror in Israel I
[02:24:43.400 --> 02:24:49.920]  want to know why there's a bias in reporting tell me what's going on and
[02:24:49.920 --> 02:24:54.680]  I appreciate your call brother let me try to get to that you know you say
[02:24:54.680 --> 02:24:58.920]  you're you're part Jewish well then I mean that's about as Masonic as it gets
[02:24:58.920 --> 02:25:04.360]  because the Jews picked all that up from Egypt and Greece in places and all it is
[02:25:04.360 --> 02:25:08.480]  is the study of ancient religions and science so it's as varied as universities
[02:25:08.480 --> 02:25:13.000]  are in the world I mean that's really all the Masons are and mostly the Masons
[02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:16.640]  have had their organizations taken over by globalist so yeah there are a lot of
[02:25:16.640 --> 02:25:20.080]  top Masons that are New World Order George Washington wrote about the Illuminati
[02:25:20.080 --> 02:25:23.280]  trying to take over the Masonic order in the United States in Europe read his
[02:25:23.280 --> 02:25:28.680]  letters it's look you can say bad stuff about Israel Israel's done some bad
[02:25:28.680 --> 02:25:33.160]  things but separately none of the Arab nations take any of the quote Palestinians
[02:25:33.160 --> 02:25:36.760]  most of them aren't even from that area they're from other areas it's uses a
[02:25:36.760 --> 02:25:43.120]  political football there is a massive worldwide jihad being funded right now
[02:25:43.120 --> 02:25:47.080]  and so you're going to have these attacks in Israel and you're going to have
[02:25:47.080 --> 02:25:51.040]  a tax here because that's what's being basically funded it's a global
[02:25:51.040 --> 02:25:56.560]  destabilization program being launched by the globalist and the Palestinians do
[02:25:56.560 --> 02:25:59.760]  live in horrible conditions and they're they're getting mad you can see it from
[02:25:59.760 --> 02:26:03.680]  people's perspectives the point is you get above it the globalist are playing
[02:26:03.680 --> 02:26:07.800]  different rips off against each other let's go thank you Ron let's go to Tara
[02:26:07.800 --> 02:26:11.560]  in Tennessee thanks for holding
[02:26:13.240 --> 02:26:20.800]  listing on 94.3 WNFZ Tara or Tara go ahead it's Tara yeah I was actually
[02:26:20.800 --> 02:26:27.000]  just calling about a news story that was actually came over the UK Daily Mail
[02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:33.480]  about his name is Sergeant Diller Johnson he wrote a book called Carnivore about
[02:26:33.480 --> 02:26:40.320]  his time in the Iraq war and my husband is actually in this book he is now a
[02:26:40.320 --> 02:26:49.200]  number two ISIS target Sergeant Johnson that is and yet we have gotten no
[02:26:49.200 --> 02:26:55.400]  communication from anyone saying hey you might want to be watching out hey this
[02:26:55.400 --> 02:27:00.440]  is what's going on and I mean I know why but I just want to know why I mean
[02:27:00.440 --> 02:27:07.640]  essentially everyone in this book who he mentions quite often are targets now
[02:27:07.640 --> 02:27:11.200]  sure Tara I'm sorry for getting your name wrong it's way across the room the
[02:27:11.200 --> 02:27:15.480]  screen today absolutely there are real ISIS fighters in Europe in the United
[02:27:15.480 --> 02:27:19.440]  States they've been having their minions attack recruiting centers and things as
[02:27:19.440 --> 02:27:25.000]  you know and because it's a real terror threat they're just hanging the military
[02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:30.200]  and targets out to dry and it's truly despicable I've had family that's had
[02:27:30.200 --> 02:27:33.880]  Mexican drug cartels send them threatening stuff to their mailbox with
[02:27:33.880 --> 02:27:39.800]  photos of them so that's how infiltrated this country is and how serious the
[02:27:39.800 --> 02:27:46.080]  situation has gotten to for US military involved not just fighting radical
[02:27:46.080 --> 02:27:49.880]  Islamists but also what's going on in Mexico a lot of covert operations
[02:27:49.880 --> 02:27:52.360]  they're being run by the State Department I'll just leave it at that
[02:27:52.360 --> 02:27:56.040]  because I don't know the details I don't I don't want to know classified stuff
[02:27:56.040 --> 02:28:01.000]  already know generally what's going on and it's it's very very scary what do
[02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:07.680]  you think is happening honestly I don't know I mean it's making it it scares me
[02:28:07.680 --> 02:28:16.360]  I you know I just I don't know what to do I nobody's telling us anything nobody
[02:28:16.360 --> 02:28:21.640]  you know I asked my husband I came home from work one day and he was like let's
[02:28:21.640 --> 02:28:26.760]  go outside and he tells me what's going on and he's like you know I've contacted
[02:28:26.760 --> 02:28:32.840]  my family you need to contact yours and you know just be careful watch around
[02:28:32.840 --> 02:28:37.600]  you and sure you know that's all we can do well you also in most states and
[02:28:37.600 --> 02:28:40.880]  certainly for an issue like that they can suppress your address and your name
[02:28:40.880 --> 02:28:45.920]  and there's other ways to do that but if you're really concerned and I think
[02:28:45.920 --> 02:28:48.720]  compared to driving on the highway it's a low threat because even though they're
[02:28:48.720 --> 02:28:52.520]  probably undoubtedly hundreds of Isis in the country they got a lot of targets
[02:28:52.520 --> 02:28:58.720]  and they'll usually hit soft targets and so I don't I'm not the total expert I
[02:28:58.720 --> 02:29:03.800]  can't tell you definitively but we've had Isis threaten us put bigs in their
[02:29:03.800 --> 02:29:07.560]  videos saying they're gonna get him he's been down to cover their bases found a
[02:29:07.560 --> 02:29:12.200]  weird mosque down right where the FBI told you to watch it was at the FBI came
[02:29:12.200 --> 02:29:15.560]  a debrief team and you know they've Isis just said they're gonna get me well
[02:29:15.560 --> 02:29:20.600]  oh good line up then and I'm not taunting Isis to come get me but at the
[02:29:20.600 --> 02:29:25.080]  same time whatever I mean you know they got their God I got mine their God's
[02:29:25.080 --> 02:29:28.880]  got big red horns a little black tail and mine doesn't I don't chop Christians
[02:29:28.880 --> 02:29:32.040]  heads off or Muslims heads off for anybody so I'm not scared of them I'm
[02:29:32.040 --> 02:29:36.480]  not scared of the New World Order and I I think you're gonna be fine Tara overall
[02:29:36.480 --> 02:29:40.280]  but there is some precautions you should take and I'd carry a firearm so at
[02:29:40.280 --> 02:29:44.080]  least you'll give as good as you get if they try something on you I think it's
[02:29:44.080 --> 02:29:47.240]  your husband is probably gonna be the real target God bless you send us some
[02:29:47.240 --> 02:29:52.640]  info I'd like to hear your March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the
[02:29:52.640 --> 02:29:56.200]  GCN radio network
[02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:03.720]  this is Joe Biggs with info wars dot com ammo control picks up stream among
[02:30:03.720 --> 02:30:09.200]  Democrats aiming to limit gun access article up at info wars dot com with
[02:30:09.200 --> 02:30:14.800]  300 million firearms in circulation and calls for more restrictions hitting a
[02:30:14.800 --> 02:30:19.000]  wall Democrats and gun control advocates from California to Virginia are
[02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:23.720]  increasingly turning to other proposals such as restricting ammunition
[02:30:23.720 --> 02:30:28.720]  magazine rounds and narrowing the ability to wield weapons California
[02:30:28.720 --> 02:30:32.280]  Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom who was running for the Democratic
[02:30:32.280 --> 02:30:37.880]  gubernatorial nomination in 2018 released a statewide ballot campaign
[02:30:37.880 --> 02:30:43.280]  Thursday to require background checks for ammunition purchases why is it that
[02:30:43.280 --> 02:30:47.600]  we have background checks for guns but not background checks for ammunition it
[02:30:47.600 --> 02:30:51.520]  makes no sense mr. Newsom said at his press conference well because it's
[02:30:51.520 --> 02:30:57.760]  ammunition you clown you can find more articles like this info wars dot com

[02:31:07.120 --> 02:31:11.040]  but when we look at a product like survival shield nason iodine x2 it's
[02:31:11.040 --> 02:31:14.720]  something that really has been hiding in plain view for over a hundred years the
[02:31:14.720 --> 02:31:19.360]  federal government mandated from the 20s until the 70s that iodine a crude form of
[02:31:19.360 --> 02:31:23.400]  it be added to table salt because of the incredible health problems that dietary
[02:31:23.400 --> 02:31:27.000]  deficiency and iodine was causing I want to challenge the listeners who've not

[02:31:38.560 --> 02:31:42.240]  final reason to try x2 is that it's so hard to keep in stock we ordered the

[02:33:13.120 --> 02:33:19.120]  time for you to choose a side you're listening to alex jones also align
[02:33:19.120 --> 02:33:24.640]  myself with wonder woman leon macadoo is gonna be popping into the story and
[02:33:24.640 --> 02:33:28.200]  then of course David nice to be telling us what's coming up in the fourth hour
[02:33:28.200 --> 02:33:31.680]  he's in the other studio we're gonna continue with your phone calls under
[02:33:31.680 --> 02:33:35.560]  news I haven't had she'll be talking about did parallel universe open up
[02:33:35.560 --> 02:33:40.480]  hundred c floating city filmed in skies above major city in china two
[02:33:40.480 --> 02:33:46.240]  chinese TV reports got it on video and they believe it's probably a hologram
[02:33:46.240 --> 02:33:51.160]  of some type project blue beam type stuff I mean the news is getting crazier
[02:33:51.160 --> 02:33:56.720]  and crazier also mainstream news reported earlier this week well NASA did
[02:33:56.720 --> 02:34:00.160]  and they're getting study day met it with radio telescopes but with visual
[02:34:00.160 --> 02:34:06.240]  telescopes a star that appears to have big space stations built around it so
[02:34:06.240 --> 02:34:11.560]  they've never seen anything like it before I just wonder if the parallel
[02:34:11.560 --> 02:34:15.680]  universe the floating city if like if you buy some weird beans and plant them
[02:34:15.680 --> 02:34:19.760]  the beanstalk grows up and that's where you find the free health care yeah is
[02:34:19.760 --> 02:34:24.000]  if you go up there and then captain america is there and everything else is
[02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:28.080]  fine and of course that's also that's where two plus two equals five laying in
[02:34:28.080 --> 02:34:31.240]  it is so we're gonna be talking with you about that briefly here in just a
[02:34:31.240 --> 02:34:34.480]  moment and then of course the nightly news is tonight seven o'clock central and
[02:34:34.480 --> 02:34:40.360]  hopefully I'll be back this sunday 4 to 6 p.m. central I will be hosting that
[02:34:40.360 --> 02:34:43.800]  show but I never take it for granted that we're still on the air all the
[02:34:43.800 --> 02:34:46.800]  censorship going on but Liam before we go to David night just briefly and they
[02:34:46.800 --> 02:34:50.280]  come back to you I don't know if you knew a year and a half ago they had me in
[02:34:50.280 --> 02:34:53.840]  there working with red skull to hurt the immigrants I only remembered that they
[02:34:53.840 --> 02:34:56.520]  had a copy in the office I've forgotten so I actually show people that it
[02:34:56.520 --> 02:35:01.600]  sounds crazy to go yeah I'm one of red skulls accomplices now but they have the
[02:35:01.600 --> 02:35:05.840]  tea party out basically attacking the poor immigrants and the black cats in
[02:35:05.840 --> 02:35:10.360]  America takes out the evil white people I mean this is getting a little over the
[02:35:10.360 --> 02:35:15.720]  top are you but maybe maybe it's true maybe actually we are with red skull
[02:35:15.720 --> 02:35:20.040]  did you ever think you were red skull I I was not aware I always thought I was
[02:35:20.040 --> 02:35:23.920]  using my powers for good but you know I thought you were the wonder woman I know
[02:35:23.920 --> 02:35:29.280]  that's I'm here to fight evil I did not realize I'm actually helping evil along
[02:35:29.280 --> 02:35:32.320]  in fact guys can you go up Wonder Woman again as we talked to David I'm gonna let
[02:35:32.320 --> 02:35:36.120]  her exit during the Wonder Woman by the way Leanne normally is wearing rock and
[02:35:36.120 --> 02:35:39.760]  roll t-shirts when she's dressed up on TV she's wearing a news outfit but this is
[02:35:39.760 --> 02:35:45.960]  her normal garb a classic Van Halen shirt and I feel I had that rock I got that
[02:35:45.960 --> 02:35:49.920]  at that tour when I was like 10 years old ladies and gentlemen 10 years old I
[02:35:49.920 --> 02:35:54.240]  actually had that exact shirt but I know you're just a trend that you got it at
[02:35:54.240 --> 02:35:57.600]  a vintage shop or something yep or did you actually get it at this year too I
[02:35:57.600 --> 02:36:03.480]  was two years old and I was at the concert seriously though maybe Wonder
[02:36:03.480 --> 02:36:08.800]  Woman's a little racist probably she was probably fighting evil all along well
[02:36:08.800 --> 02:36:13.840]  we probably need a black Wonder Woman to chop her head off right or a transgender
[02:36:13.840 --> 02:36:20.000]  Wonder Woman that's it a Wonder Woman woman it could be like Jenner woman just
[02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:25.000]  incredibly incredible courage and stunning even if he looks like dead
[02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:27.400]  celery or something I'm supposed to just think it's the hottest thing I've ever
[02:36:27.400 --> 02:36:31.840]  seen in my life Leanne suspend your disbelief just like you blame invisible how
[02:36:31.840 --> 02:36:35.160]  does it feel like mirror mirror on the wall who's the fairest of them all and
[02:36:35.160 --> 02:36:41.120]  it says you are beautiful my queen but not as beautiful as Caitlyn Jenner well
[02:36:41.120 --> 02:36:45.440]  you should just accept it are you gonna send the Huntsman after Jenner you know
[02:36:45.440 --> 02:36:49.640]  we were talking about this the other day and I don't I don't mind you know if
[02:36:49.640 --> 02:36:53.000]  that's how you want to identify I will honor that but you got to worship it the
[02:36:53.000 --> 02:37:01.080]  thing that's so no worship it now I will worship it check your check your
[02:37:01.080 --> 02:37:09.600]  check your white male privilege your privilege check your privilege but but
[02:37:09.600 --> 02:37:15.680]  okay so fine I will worship and honor you but must I also suspend my belief
[02:37:15.680 --> 02:37:19.160]  suspend my why didn't they get a good-looking tranny to be there
[02:37:19.160 --> 02:37:24.800]  spokesperson looks like shriveled-up peanut rebel or something
[02:37:24.800 --> 02:37:29.200]  crusty well no I mean I'm not I'm not I'm not bashing anybody but I've seen on
[02:37:29.200 --> 02:37:32.180]  TV before they go that's a woman looks like a I mean that's a man that you
[02:37:32.180 --> 02:37:35.680]  know it was like a woman but the Jenner doesn't even look like a woman well
[02:37:35.680 --> 02:37:39.920]  she's looks like a possum with a wig on well you must not have seen her bikini
[02:37:39.920 --> 02:37:45.880]  photos oh yeah I saw it photos released of Jenner topless and it's really just
[02:37:45.880 --> 02:37:51.120]  him at the beach as a guy I apologize I got I'm gonna Lee and we're gonna come
[02:37:51.120 --> 02:37:53.680]  back David Knight is a little more serious that's why I have him hosting
[02:37:53.680 --> 02:37:57.040]  the fourth hour doing a great job they spent her now about three and a half
[02:37:57.040 --> 02:38:00.760]  years with his family moved under from North Carolina and David what do you
[02:38:00.760 --> 02:38:06.080]  think just about the general insanity of the world they're clearly just 300 400
[02:38:06.080 --> 02:38:10.120]  percent increases in demonization of the Tea Party and Patriots this year and
[02:38:10.120 --> 02:38:13.800]  then now they're launching this domestic anti-terror force saying we're about to
[02:38:13.800 --> 02:38:16.840]  blow stuff up any minute I mean it's pretty obvious they're getting ready to
[02:38:16.840 --> 02:38:20.160]  pull off a new Oklahoma City in my view yeah Alex you know you're talking about
[02:38:20.160 --> 02:38:24.760]  this Captain America situation their propaganda has really become very
[02:38:24.760 --> 02:38:28.360]  cartoonish quite for quite some time actually and they've been doing this a
[02:38:28.360 --> 02:38:31.440]  very long time just as we were talking about the other day going all the way
[02:38:31.440 --> 02:38:35.560]  back to the very beginning of civil asset forfeiture where they encouraged
[02:38:35.560 --> 02:38:39.480]  the police to fund their departments by seizing the property of people who were
[02:38:39.480 --> 02:38:43.680]  not convicted not even charged with the crime at the same time they passed that
[02:38:43.680 --> 02:38:48.560]  bill Alex that was 1984 fall of 1984 they began Miami Vice where they talked
[02:38:48.560 --> 02:38:53.160]  about how cool it was that the police could drive around in these exotic boats
[02:38:53.160 --> 02:38:57.500]  these exotic cars fueling both sides of this insane
[02:38:57.500 --> 02:39:02.080]  asset forfeiture seizure yeah exactly exactly and now people are starting to
[02:39:02.080 --> 02:39:05.160]  move back you know we've got an article today on info wars.com the growing
[02:39:05.160 --> 02:39:09.480]  bipartisan consensus to roll back the failed war on drugs well it's not only
[02:39:09.480 --> 02:39:14.360]  failed from a pragmatic standpoint but it never had any constitutional authority
[02:39:14.360 --> 02:39:17.040]  to begin with we're going to talk a little bit about that but also when
[02:39:17.040 --> 02:39:20.840]  you're talking about these floating cities there's technology that is out
[02:39:20.840 --> 02:39:24.200]  there as we learned that interview that you had with Annie Jacobson about the
[02:39:24.200 --> 02:39:29.440]  Pentagon's brain talking about how going back to the Vietnam War they had
[02:39:29.440 --> 02:39:33.600]  drones that they were using in Vietnam and of course we know about operations
[02:39:33.600 --> 02:39:39.600]  northwards where they had wanted to use commercial airlines to hit buildings and
[02:39:39.600 --> 02:39:44.000]  have terrorist attacks on shopping centers so they could portray Cuba as a
[02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:48.200]  terrorist organization and create an an American invasion of Cuba sounds very
[02:39:48.200 --> 02:39:52.240]  familiar doesn't it that was in the 1960s along with these early drones so
[02:39:52.240 --> 02:39:55.920]  we've learned about this over the years gradually they've rolled this out we had
[02:39:55.920 --> 02:40:00.000]  a leak of classified documents come out yesterday from the same people that gave
[02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:04.080]  us the Snowden leaks they're talking about this being a second Snowden and in
[02:40:04.080 --> 02:40:09.000]  many ways it is because just as Snowden was exposing information that NSA
[02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:12.720]  whistleblowers had put out there a decade earlier he produced some documents
[02:40:12.720 --> 02:40:17.080]  these are some documents that again repeat what we have known about these
[02:40:17.080 --> 02:40:21.120]  drone assassination program for quite some time but they don't tell people
[02:40:21.120 --> 02:40:24.640]  what we're at the cusp of and I think one of the things that really
[02:40:24.640 --> 02:40:29.320]  illustrates this as an allegory is the fact that Tesla cars became autonomous
[02:40:29.320 --> 02:40:35.320]  overnight which is a software update yesterday and that is what we're seeing
[02:40:35.320 --> 02:40:40.160]  here they put all the pieces in place they test all the pieces and then it's
[02:40:40.160 --> 02:40:44.680]  just a real quick flip of a switch or a real that's the headline did Tesla just
[02:40:44.680 --> 02:40:48.160]  go Terminator or Skynet yes and people think oh you're just getting out from
[02:40:48.160 --> 02:40:52.360]  the movie I've seen Pentagon documents in my book we're in the 70s they called it
[02:40:52.360 --> 02:40:58.480]  Skynet or SkyGrid yes I mean the movie is imitating reality oh and it's not
[02:40:58.480 --> 02:41:01.960]  even there's not even any question about that popular science that loves to talk
[02:41:01.960 --> 02:41:06.360]  about all this technology coming from the Defense Department especially DARPA
[02:41:06.360 --> 02:41:11.080]  they love to talk about it in a G whiz it's always benevolent context and that
[02:41:11.080 --> 02:41:14.920]  was a very beginning of the the article the rise of machines has begun
[02:41:14.920 --> 02:41:19.680]  fittingly with an overnight wireless global awakening and so they're very
[02:41:19.680 --> 02:41:23.160]  well aware all the machines had an awakening so you're gonna be covering
[02:41:23.160 --> 02:41:27.920]  that in the fourth hour and more great job at David Knight and of course who's
[02:41:27.920 --> 02:41:31.360]  hosting the nightly news tonight's seven o'clock Central that'll be myself the
[02:41:31.360 --> 02:41:36.000]  end that'll be Wonder Woman all the world is waiting for her thank you so much
[02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:39.200]  David Knight we'll be watching and listening to you in the fourth hour
[02:41:39.200 --> 02:41:42.080]  thank you thank you you want to thank all of our affiliates for picking up the
[02:41:42.080 --> 02:41:45.680]  show I know a lot of stations are picking up the fourth hour want to thank you
[02:41:45.680 --> 02:41:50.720]  for doing that I co-hosted a lot David Knight Jacari Jackson Rob do Lee and
[02:41:50.720 --> 02:41:56.120]  Maca do and others and as time goes on we will over the years add more and more
[02:41:56.120 --> 02:42:01.360]  counter programming here on air Lee and getting into the parallel universe right
[02:42:01.360 --> 02:42:05.720]  so this is a parallel universe hundreds of people well actually thousands of
[02:42:05.720 --> 02:42:10.200]  residents in two different areas in China reported seeing this it was reported
[02:42:10.200 --> 02:42:14.960]  on the the in the Chinese media there did parallel universe open up hundreds see
[02:42:14.960 --> 02:42:20.680]  floating city filmed in the skies above China and so they're called their
[02:42:20.680 --> 02:42:25.120]  weather experts are saying that this phenomenon is it's an illusion called
[02:42:25.120 --> 02:42:30.240]  Fata Morgana which is they say it can be seen on land or sea it involves the
[02:42:30.240 --> 02:42:35.600]  optical distortion and inversion of distant objects such as boats which will
[02:42:35.600 --> 02:42:40.720]  appear stacked like skyscrapers because the rays of light will bend but this is
[02:42:40.720 --> 02:42:45.840]  clearly a city it's not a boat a stack of boat and then there's another video as
[02:42:45.840 --> 02:42:50.960]  well where it's a really intricate a detailed Phantom City floating over
[02:42:50.960 --> 02:42:55.960]  China so of course the internet is has gone ablaze they're wondering is this
[02:42:55.960 --> 02:43:01.720]  a project blue beam test something like that or China they say with all the
[02:43:01.720 --> 02:43:05.720]  technology technological achievements that they have are they using it sure
[02:43:05.720 --> 02:43:10.720]  some type of holographic thing to see the response from the public there well
[02:43:10.720 --> 02:43:18.560]  the dead giveaway of this spectacular footage is that you notice it's in key
[02:43:18.560 --> 02:43:22.680]  low-lying thick clouds and this has happened in Mexico City where flying
[02:43:22.680 --> 02:43:26.680]  saucers are seen this has happened out in Arizona when they have low-level fog
[02:43:26.680 --> 02:43:32.520]  and then they see lights in the hills and then they see these flying saucers
[02:43:32.520 --> 02:43:37.280]  are building show up and it is declassified partially remember DARPA
[02:43:37.280 --> 02:43:40.120]  years ago was like in popular mechanics he was mentioning that in popular
[02:43:40.120 --> 02:43:43.720]  science at articles about the Pentagon admits they've got secret programs with
[02:43:43.720 --> 02:43:50.280]  high-powered systems to be able to project a 500-yard tall Buddha or Jesus
[02:43:50.280 --> 02:43:55.320]  flying saucers whatever they want and but they need cloud cover they need the
[02:43:55.320 --> 02:43:59.280]  right type of atmospherics to do it really big I mean in the 50s they had
[02:43:59.280 --> 02:44:03.080]  Disneyland and I went there before they upgraded it when I was a kid in the 70s
[02:44:03.080 --> 02:44:06.360]  or early 80s they had ghosts flying around you know in the haunted house and
[02:44:06.360 --> 02:44:09.000]  look real hey I was like you know 10 years old like man that's really scary
[02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:11.600]  I was there a ghost through the wall and those are just little you know
[02:44:11.600 --> 02:44:17.000]  holograms three different projectors together 1950s technology so we know
[02:44:17.000 --> 02:44:21.600]  when I'm in the first Iraq war they sprayed hallucinogens on the Iraqi
[02:44:21.600 --> 02:44:25.160]  Army they were just conscripts anyways a lot nicer than killing them
[02:44:25.160 --> 02:44:28.920]  of course they dropped beef to two bombs on them too as I guess they did as part
[02:44:28.920 --> 02:44:33.640]  of the psychological hop hit them with different biological excuse me chemicals
[02:44:33.640 --> 02:44:39.080]  and then did project some really wild stuff Mohammed Jesus you name it into
[02:44:39.080 --> 02:44:43.880]  the world stuff super ships flying saucers so people just panicking give
[02:44:43.880 --> 02:44:48.400]  up hey man I just saw flying saucers I'm giving up and really it's three jumbo
[02:44:48.400 --> 02:44:53.840]  jets up projecting it down on the ground and they're up at 30,000 feet but a lot
[02:44:53.840 --> 02:44:57.920]  of times the this happens in big cities too because they've got projectors in
[02:44:57.920 --> 02:45:01.840]  buildings and then they're just testing the public see the globalists are
[02:45:01.840 --> 02:45:05.880]  scientists they test what's in the water they test the GMO they test
[02:45:05.880 --> 02:45:11.680]  communism they test Nazism they test you know different organizations different
[02:45:11.680 --> 02:45:16.760]  groups different movements to try to develop the best program to control
[02:45:16.760 --> 02:45:20.800]  people we're saying elevate yourself to the level that they've been so arrogant
[02:45:20.800 --> 02:45:25.200]  most of this is admitted geoengineering you name it and so you can get to the
[02:45:25.200 --> 02:45:30.000]  level of engineering your own views by the real research not having them
[02:45:30.000 --> 02:45:34.320]  engineer you and you can be at the technocrat level but use it against them
[02:45:34.320 --> 02:45:38.400]  their arrogance will be there downfall Ian well and so what do you think about
[02:45:38.400 --> 02:45:43.720]  this this project blue beam I believe it was like Reagan said how great it would
[02:45:43.720 --> 02:45:46.840]  be if we had some sort of an alien invasion do you think they're testing
[02:45:46.840 --> 02:45:50.160]  out some type of a scenario like that for the future the Americans warning us
[02:45:50.160 --> 02:45:54.440]  about oh we're soon we're gonna meet our alien exactly no that's in fact I'm
[02:45:54.440 --> 02:45:58.280]  glad you brought that up I forgot about that Gorbachev Reagan Jimmy Carter I
[02:45:58.280 --> 02:46:04.640]  mean the the amount of world leaders heads of NASA I've talked to multiple high
[02:46:04.640 --> 02:46:08.720]  level astronauts off-air that said they saw flying saucers they saw spaceships
[02:46:08.720 --> 02:46:11.560]  they saw space bases a lot of famous astronauts
[02:46:11.560 --> 02:46:14.880]  agrimatials on record saying you know they were falling around constantly by
[02:46:14.880 --> 02:46:18.080]  them and then I've interviewed Buzz Aldrin on air he started just going well
[02:46:18.080 --> 02:46:20.760]  you know the folks that built the pyramids built the base on the moon of
[02:46:20.760 --> 02:46:25.480]  Mars and there's a real obelisk that's 2001 but that's classified I can't get
[02:46:25.480 --> 02:46:30.920]  into it I mean and then one time now I'm gonna just the point is is that like are
[02:46:30.920 --> 02:46:34.320]  they are these are these are these guys planning psyopsis on us or did they
[02:46:34.320 --> 02:46:38.320]  really see flying saucers well and that's the thing is you know obviously in
[02:46:38.320 --> 02:46:42.360]  the Bible it talks about the second coming of Christ and all of that so what
[02:46:42.360 --> 02:46:46.000]  if they were to create some type of scenario like that where people say oh
[02:46:46.000 --> 02:46:49.560]  wow you know well they talk about everyone's seeing the beast and the
[02:46:49.560 --> 02:46:53.000]  machine that's with the beast and revelations and put the actual passage
[02:46:53.000 --> 02:46:56.440]  and then in Jerusalem there is a machine that speaks for the beast right that's
[02:46:56.440 --> 02:47:02.560]  worship that everyone can see mm-hmm and describes this huge being that is like
[02:47:02.560 --> 02:47:07.320]  that is the beast but is the machine the facsimile of the beast and then it can
[02:47:07.320 --> 02:47:11.800]  be seen worldwide right and and here they are like testing this technology with
[02:47:11.800 --> 02:47:16.600]  these floating cities and just telling everyone oh it's this it's a boat flipped
[02:47:16.600 --> 02:47:19.480]  upside down and now there's no chemtrails there's just tens of thousands of
[02:47:19.480 --> 02:47:23.840]  documents submitting geoengineering right they don't want anyone to be aware of
[02:47:23.840 --> 02:47:28.920]  it until they're ready to launch the project it is crazy because you watch
[02:47:28.920 --> 02:47:34.720]  that video that's shot by multiple news agencies and it's either staged by the
[02:47:34.720 --> 02:47:37.960]  government through the news agency in his fake but the only witnesses say they
[02:47:37.960 --> 02:47:45.520]  saw it or it's a giant hologram that is not some anomaly right and this is in
[02:47:45.520 --> 02:47:49.840]  2011 this happened I mean this has happened multiple times I mean obviously
[02:47:49.840 --> 02:47:53.960]  we know in a lot of cities there in China they do have a major issues with

[02:49:06.160 --> 02:49:14.880]  angry hey I wanted to tell the info warriors out there about a very good
[02:49:14.880 --> 02:49:21.280]  documentary that your buddy Tex Mars and pastor Stephen Anderson had put
[02:49:21.280 --> 02:49:27.840]  together it's called marching to Zion they'll give you a comprehensive look at
[02:49:27.840 --> 02:49:33.040]  who the bankers are and who are orchestrating everything in our reality
[02:49:33.040 --> 02:49:38.720]  our divide and conquer everything do you want to know in that document so are you
[02:49:38.720 --> 02:49:44.680]  saying Zionists run everything no there's what at one one percent or two
[02:49:44.680 --> 02:49:51.160]  percent the whole world no they have to be 98% of the Gentile Zionists that have
[02:49:51.160 --> 02:49:57.000]  to collaborate in order to make this work you have to have people that sell
[02:49:57.000 --> 02:50:04.080]  out it's all about the big money well I've never had I've never had Jews show
[02:50:04.080 --> 02:50:08.560]  up and say show out to them and I've also seen the power of Jews are pretty
[02:50:08.560 --> 02:50:11.200]  diverse groups of people in my experience different views of a political
[02:50:11.200 --> 02:50:15.920]  ideas I mean I've been people told me that I'm supposedly Jewish because I'm
[02:50:15.920 --> 02:50:20.640]  successful or that Leigh Ann's Jewish I mean she's German and Scottish and
[02:50:20.640 --> 02:50:25.440]  something would be bad if she was Jewish it's just at a certain point it gets a
[02:50:25.440 --> 02:50:30.660]  little crazy when people believe that only Jews can have power I mean people
[02:50:30.660 --> 02:50:36.360]  say the name Jones is a Jewish name I mean I'm about as Jewish as a pork chop
[02:50:36.360 --> 02:50:41.920]  but I mean nothing against Jews that's fine but but I'll certainly look into it
[02:50:41.920 --> 02:50:47.280]  there is a big Jewish mafia and it does use political correctness and I'm

[03:00:41.200 --> 03:00:45.040]  problem real quick I got two points one point I want to make real quick is I
[03:00:45.040 --> 03:00:50.120]  want to plug beyond tangy tangerine I just want to remind people how essential
[03:00:50.120 --> 03:00:54.520]  that is for your overall well-being I read the book dead doctors don't lie by

[03:00:58.600 --> 03:01:03.040]  beyond tangy tangerine and that helps what the broadcast a true game changer in
[03:01:03.040 --> 03:01:06.600]  fact I'm getting ready to do a whole push for the whole young gravity line
[03:01:06.600 --> 03:01:11.560]  because it's so good absolutely I would go I would go on and say that was the
[03:01:11.560 --> 03:01:15.240]  number one most important product that people should take every day but moving
[03:01:15.240 --> 03:01:20.560]  on my second point Alex I got a question about carbon taxes it's my
[03:01:20.560 --> 03:01:25.920]  understand actually I want to ask just exactly how and who benefits from the
[03:01:25.920 --> 03:01:29.800]  carbon tax because these regulations that are going to be slapped on these big
[03:01:29.800 --> 03:01:32.520]  factories and corporations in my understanding it's going to cut down
[03:01:32.520 --> 03:01:37.320]  production and just increase prices for the consumer so how do they benefit from
[03:01:37.320 --> 03:01:43.120]  a carbon tax to produce credit they have to buy a carbon credit from one of ten
[03:01:43.120 --> 03:01:48.200]  exchanges I know of two in the US one in England couple in Europe some in China
[03:01:48.200 --> 03:01:52.560]  Japan Australia and it's all owned by former government leaders the Rothschilds
[03:01:52.560 --> 03:01:58.680]  on the big European exchange and UK exchange Al Gore owns one of them with
[03:01:58.680 --> 03:02:03.760]  Lord blood I'm not joking it's actually Gorin blood as the name of the company
[03:02:03.760 --> 03:02:09.600]  Chicago Mercantile carbon exchange is owned by Obama and some other
[03:02:09.600 --> 03:02:14.840]  Democrats you can't make this up they already have them in Australia England
[03:02:14.840 --> 03:02:18.840]  and other areas and then you don't even see it's just a fee on your energy bill
[03:02:18.840 --> 03:02:28.880]  or on your gas and then and then that fee is paid directly to Al Gore okay so I
[03:02:28.880 --> 03:02:33.000]  mean that pretty much answers my question now I mean it's politicians
[03:02:33.000 --> 03:02:37.480]  having you pay taxes to a consortium that then pays them it is then the most
[03:02:37.480 --> 03:02:42.320]  gang raping you can have other than mega banks demanding bail ins where
[03:02:42.320 --> 03:02:45.200]  they're now going to take money and are doing it directly out of European
[03:02:45.200 --> 03:02:49.600]  bank accounts it's direct tax to the bankers that's world government just
[03:02:49.600 --> 03:02:53.840]  direct just like secret treaties rule us you name and if you don't like it
[03:02:53.840 --> 03:02:56.640]  you're racist and they'll they'll say you're with red skull you know I mean
[03:02:56.640 --> 03:02:58.720]  that's what they do that's you're like hey I don't want to be under secret
[03:02:58.720 --> 03:03:02.120]  treaties really we'll say you're a racist and love red skull and put Nazi
[03:03:02.120 --> 03:03:05.680]  flags behind you it's like oh really thank you very much Marvel your total
[03:03:05.680 --> 03:03:11.600]  scum your total criminal trash praying on your moron readers God bless you
[03:03:11.600 --> 03:03:16.480]  appreciate your call William Morgan and FEMA region for go ahead you're on the
[03:03:16.480 --> 03:03:22.680]  air can you hear me all right yes I can yes sir I'm a long-time listener first
[03:03:22.680 --> 03:03:28.840]  time caller but I am a freemason and I know we moved past it but I just wanted
[03:03:28.840 --> 03:03:32.680]  to say that there is a large contingency if you want to call up that
[03:03:32.680 --> 03:03:38.560]  inside the Masonic large system that is very pro-info wars just like me they're
[03:03:38.560 --> 03:03:44.080]  they're very libertarian very anti-New World Order all of it well that's
[03:03:44.080 --> 03:03:48.840]  originally what it was at least in the European and US branch as everybody
[03:03:48.840 --> 03:03:52.600]  historically was overall pretty good for the enlightenment but now wouldn't you
[03:03:52.600 --> 03:03:55.080]  agree though they've had a lot of globalist people and they're taking it
[03:03:55.080 --> 03:04:01.000]  over yes yes and no obviously I've encountered it I'm certainly not a
[03:04:01.000 --> 03:04:04.880]  porch Mason as you call it member of the Allied Masonic degrees and other high
[03:04:04.880 --> 03:04:12.280]  level invitational only bodies but I do encounter a large amount of anti-New
[03:04:12.280 --> 03:04:18.200]  World Order pro sovereignty pro traditional Americana in the most I mean
[03:04:18.200 --> 03:04:21.680]  the problem criticizing Masons is you're criticizing Americana
[03:04:21.680 --> 03:04:26.480]  Masons were the main force founding America and that is a fact and that's
[03:04:26.480 --> 03:04:29.720]  why the globalists have tried to take it over and that's why I would say tell
[03:04:29.720 --> 03:04:33.400]  people you know they can investigate it for themselves and it's just like good
[03:04:33.400 --> 03:04:37.880]  people becoming cops and people become Masons you know then they can make it be
[03:04:37.880 --> 03:04:41.560]  a force of good I'm not saying go become Masons I don't need to I just am not
[03:04:41.560 --> 03:04:45.440]  gonna sit here and just say it's a Masonic conspiracy and they run the whole
[03:04:45.440 --> 03:04:49.280]  thing it's bigger than that I'm sorry I'm out of time William call me back you
[03:04:49.280 --> 03:04:53.240]  can speak more on it other callers David Knight's coming up and I'll be back

[03:08:06.440 --> 03:08:13.120]  war continues it's alex jones and the GCN radio network
[03:08:17.120 --> 03:08:21.440]  welcome to the fourth hour the alex jones radio show I'm David Knight this is
[03:08:21.440 --> 03:08:24.440]  the news wrap up we're also going to wrap up with our callers we're going to go
[03:08:24.440 --> 03:08:27.920]  to Patricia Timothy and Daisy who are on hold and I'm gonna take any more calls
[03:08:27.920 --> 03:08:31.400]  after that because we're gonna talk about what's been happening in the news as
[03:08:31.400 --> 03:08:37.200]  I mentioned with alex jones there's been a major release about the drone program
[03:08:37.200 --> 03:08:41.160]  actually the assassination program as they point out drones are simply a tool
[03:08:41.160 --> 03:08:46.640]  assassination is the policy and just yesterday we had Paul Craig Roberts
[03:08:46.640 --> 03:08:50.840]  saying that Putin needs to be very careful the CIA may assassinate him of
[03:08:50.840 --> 03:08:55.880]  course that is an issue that is always in the forefront when you're dealing with
[03:08:55.880 --> 03:08:59.320]  the American government anymore it used to be that we were ashamed of that even
[03:08:59.320 --> 03:09:04.320]  when we were doing it back in the 1970s now they openly do it and we're going to
[03:09:04.320 --> 03:09:09.040]  look at this drone leak of this classified document talk about what it
[03:09:09.040 --> 03:09:12.320]  shows us what it doesn't show us we're also going to talk about the double
[03:09:12.320 --> 03:09:18.400]  standard in the religion of the national security state we've seen NSA
[03:09:18.400 --> 03:09:22.440]  whistleblowers like Thomas Drake that I talked to a couple of months ago talking
[03:09:22.440 --> 03:09:25.600]  at the time about the double standard between the way they were coming after
[03:09:25.600 --> 03:09:29.120]  him and the way they're not coming after Hillary Clinton and of course we have
[03:09:29.120 --> 03:09:33.600]  Obama essentially pouring cold water on the FBI's investigation so we're going
[03:09:33.600 --> 03:09:38.120]  to talk about what's happened to some of the recent whistleblowers and what
[03:09:38.120 --> 03:09:42.120]  looks like is not going to happen with Hillary Clinton also we have Ron Paul
[03:09:42.120 --> 03:09:45.600]  talking about the greatest resistance to the Federal Reserve audit is a desire
[03:09:45.600 --> 03:09:51.880]  to keep international activities secret what's behind that the push to do ammo
[03:09:51.880 --> 03:09:56.000]  control because you know folks if you don't have ammunition your guns are
[03:09:56.000 --> 03:10:00.520]  simply clubs they don't need to go door-to-door and fight you to take your
[03:10:00.520 --> 03:10:04.600]  guns because you won't have any bullets if you can't continuously replace them
[03:10:04.600 --> 03:10:08.360]  so we're going to talk about how that's been a part of the Obama administration
[03:10:08.360 --> 03:10:11.520]  from the very beginning of the administration and finally I want to
[03:10:11.520 --> 03:10:16.800]  talk about the top French meteorologist who was recently told not to report to
[03:10:16.800 --> 03:10:22.960]  work take a forced holiday because he debunked climate hysteria can't have
[03:10:22.960 --> 03:10:26.960]  that happen can we now so we're going to go to some of those subjects and we're
[03:10:26.960 --> 03:10:29.480]  going to go to our callers in just a moment before I do I want to let you

[03:11:41.040 --> 03:11:48.280]  Arizona you've been holding for a while go ahead Patricia. Hi David I called I live
[03:11:48.280 --> 03:11:53.920]  in Yuma Arizona and considering you're gonna talk about drones today I live
[03:11:53.920 --> 03:11:58.520]  right over the mountains from a government testing ground and someone
[03:11:58.520 --> 03:12:02.560]  told me that I asked them why are there so many drones in the sky every night
[03:12:02.560 --> 03:12:08.560]  they said that this is the testing area for them I mean it's not unusual for me
[03:12:08.560 --> 03:12:16.160]  one one that I looked just on one side of my house and counted 35 drones. Wow wow well
[03:12:16.160 --> 03:12:19.160]  I think we're gonna see a lot more drones everywhere not just in test areas
[03:12:19.160 --> 03:12:24.720]  because we have the Bureau of Land Management as well as the EPA using
[03:12:24.720 --> 03:12:29.920]  drones to constantly surveil us they're mapping out what they see on the ground
[03:12:29.920 --> 03:12:33.000]  but they're also looking to see if they can find you violating a regulation of
[03:12:33.000 --> 03:12:37.080]  some sort and so it's going to be a constant surveillance a constant
[03:12:37.080 --> 03:12:41.200]  taxation by the people who write the laws they're then going to use these drones
[03:12:41.200 --> 03:12:45.600]  to police those laws will drag you into their regulatory courts where you have
[03:12:45.600 --> 03:12:49.920]  no presumption of innocence they're going to pretend that you're being tried
[03:12:49.920 --> 03:12:53.200]  under civil law just like we're talking about civil asset forfeiture under the
[03:12:53.200 --> 03:12:56.520]  drug law that's what they will do just like they came after that poor fellow
[03:12:56.520 --> 03:13:02.720]  in Montana who has only eight acres is a welder he put in a pond before a stock
[03:13:02.720 --> 03:13:06.320]  pond as well as a swimming hole for his kids the water doesn't cross his
[03:13:06.320 --> 03:13:10.560]  boundaries he he went through all the paperwork for the state and local levels
[03:13:10.560 --> 03:13:14.360]  no problems whatsoever but the EPA thinks that they own all the water in the
[03:13:14.360 --> 03:13:20.440]  world now and so they came in and put 37,500 dollar a day fines against him
[03:13:20.440 --> 03:13:24.000]  his tab is now over 16 million dollars so that's what they're going to use these
[03:13:24.000 --> 03:13:28.800]  drones for in the long run but yeah it is very concerning to see how they are
[03:13:28.800 --> 03:13:33.880]  ramping up the use of this high-tech surveillance equipment besides testing
[03:13:33.880 --> 03:13:37.560]  and I guess they're testing it in in your area
[03:13:37.560 --> 03:13:45.040]  well I proud because I yesterday Alex was talking about how they're going to you
[03:13:45.040 --> 03:13:51.640]  know this new cities thing with the UN and all that and how there's going to be
[03:13:51.640 --> 03:13:59.600]  profiling people and I just wanted this isn't this is a an area of relatively
[03:13:59.600 --> 03:14:06.160]  older an older community a lot of people come down to Arizona for the winter you
[03:14:06.160 --> 03:14:11.520]  know snowbirds we call them yeah and a lot a lot of these people own guns and
[03:14:11.520 --> 03:14:19.720]  they are patriots but we had the gas company coming here saying they were
[03:14:19.720 --> 03:14:26.080]  seeing where the pipes were and walking through and then I went and looked at the
[03:14:26.080 --> 03:14:30.680]  truck and the truck had a consulting firm a name on the side of the truck so I
[03:14:30.680 --> 03:14:36.080]  looked it up and it said this is a consulting firm that has been
[03:14:36.280 --> 03:14:41.800]  subcontracted under Homeland Security so I went out to talk to these guys to
[03:14:41.800 --> 03:14:46.400]  find out what the story was and they were sitting there with pages and pages of
[03:14:46.400 --> 03:14:51.760]  check-off lists and they've come out here three times and they would went
[03:14:51.760 --> 03:14:56.880]  through my yard and and then the gas company a few days later I see this
[03:14:56.880 --> 03:15:00.680]  guy with a computer and he's standing in front of each other and I said what do
[03:15:00.680 --> 03:15:06.040]  you guys do and then he said oh we're finding out where the meters are but I
[03:15:06.040 --> 03:15:09.720]  looked on the guy's computer and they were not only finding out where the
[03:15:09.720 --> 03:15:13.480]  meters were but they were mapping out the entire yard yeah that's the thing
[03:15:13.480 --> 03:15:18.120]  that's concerning isn't it how they will not be open and transparent with
[03:15:18.120 --> 03:15:21.480]  anything that they're doing we see this over and over again that's the thing
[03:15:21.480 --> 03:15:26.320]  that really sticks in my craw the fact that they will not tell you what they're
[03:15:26.320 --> 03:15:30.360]  doing why are they ashamed of this everything that they do is is secret
[03:15:30.360 --> 03:15:35.000]  and of course Patricia when you're talking about this we need to understand
[03:15:35.000 --> 03:15:39.800]  that with geospatial intelligence with the kinds of things that we saw Jade
[03:15:39.800 --> 03:15:43.840]  Helm practicing on they they made it very clear what they were doing was
[03:15:43.840 --> 03:15:48.080]  trying to map out where people are part of geospatial intelligence is looking
[03:15:48.080 --> 03:15:51.440]  at your political your religious beliefs your social activity looking at your
[03:15:51.440 --> 03:15:56.640]  creating activity based intelligence where do you go who do you see who are
[03:15:56.640 --> 03:16:01.120]  the people that you know and then putting all of this into a database and
[03:16:01.120 --> 03:16:06.360]  choosing targets by algorithm all of this converges together when you're
[03:16:06.360 --> 03:16:10.120]  talking about the strong city network my understanding of it at least at this
[03:16:10.120 --> 03:16:14.720]  point this is something that's arisen originally out of Europe and the
[03:16:14.720 --> 03:16:17.840]  think tank that is going to be running this is the Department of Justice
[03:16:17.840 --> 03:16:20.600]  press release said there's going to be a think tank in Europe that's running it
[03:16:20.600 --> 03:16:23.960]  if you go back and you look at what this think tank has been preoccupied with in
[03:16:23.960 --> 03:16:29.880]  Europe they're concerned about anti-migrant anti-islam comments when
[03:16:29.880 --> 03:16:34.120]  they talk about radical extremists they're not talking about jihadis
[03:16:34.120 --> 03:16:39.440]  they're talking about people who don't like the massive open borders that's
[03:16:39.440 --> 03:16:43.800]  what they're targeting at and so you look at these various efforts just like
[03:16:43.800 --> 03:16:47.400]  we had yesterday we had a new initiative coming from the Department of Justice
[03:16:47.400 --> 03:16:51.760]  saying they're going to look at domestic terrorists every couple of days we see
[03:16:51.760 --> 03:16:57.360]  another move by the Obama administration to target people that are in political
[03:16:57.360 --> 03:17:01.000]  opposition to them and when they put all these people together when they start
[03:17:01.000 --> 03:17:05.280]  mapping your political beliefs your religious beliefs and your activity all
[03:17:05.280 --> 03:17:10.240]  this and put it into a database they want to see who pops up and the
[03:17:10.240 --> 03:17:15.400]  opportunity for false positives for them to target people that are no threat to
[03:17:15.400 --> 03:17:18.800]  them other than the fact that we oppose them politically that is what's really
[03:17:18.800 --> 03:17:22.720]  really dangerous and that's not what they even talk about in this classified
[03:17:22.720 --> 03:17:27.960]  document release about these drones and that they're talking about a very crude
[03:17:27.960 --> 03:17:31.960]  targeting method where you've got the president being presented with kind of
[03:17:31.960 --> 03:17:35.560]  like baseball playing cards of people they want to target in these other
[03:17:35.560 --> 03:17:39.800]  countries that they're attacking and then he kind of chooses that and it runs
[03:17:39.800 --> 03:17:44.360]  through this whole process that's bad enough that we have a policy of
[03:17:44.360 --> 03:17:48.680]  assassination that is run like that that's bad enough but when we have a
[03:17:48.680 --> 03:17:52.440]  situation where we've got a computer algorithm that is going to be targeting
[03:17:52.440 --> 03:17:55.440]  people when we have situations where they're talking about creating and are
[03:17:55.440 --> 03:18:01.000]  actually working on swarming drones autonomous killing machines and then we
[03:18:01.000 --> 03:18:05.720]  have computers that create enemies by algorithm I mean this is absolutely
[03:18:05.720 --> 03:18:10.000]  insane but this is where we're headed if we don't stop this patrician
[03:18:10.000 --> 03:18:17.840]  how can what what what can we do I feel like they are seriously profiling some
[03:18:17.840 --> 03:18:21.800]  people out here you know they are seriously profiling everybody this is
[03:18:21.800 --> 03:18:25.840]  total information awareness this has been the modus operandi the government
[03:18:25.840 --> 03:18:30.160]  since their 9-11 attacks this is what the Patriot Act is all fundamentally about
[03:18:30.160 --> 03:18:34.520]  and they've been working on all this for a very long time that is where this is
[03:18:34.520 --> 03:18:38.840]  all headed how do we stop it I don't think we can stop it in Washington I
[03:18:38.840 --> 03:18:41.840]  don't think these bureaucracies are out of control I think what we're going to
[03:18:41.840 --> 03:18:45.680]  have to do is we're going to have to start electing people at the local level
[03:18:45.680 --> 03:18:50.280]  at the state level who are going to say you are going to respect our privacy you
[03:18:50.280 --> 03:18:54.200]  are not going and monitoring this making sure that they're not going to use
[03:18:54.200 --> 03:18:58.400]  utility companies or contractors to collect information and to profile us
[03:18:58.400 --> 03:19:01.760]  and to put us into a database we have to stop it at the data collection point
[03:19:01.760 --> 03:19:06.080]  and we have to do that Patricia I think at the local level and I think when we
[03:19:06.080 --> 03:19:09.760]  look at the presidential races yes it's important to understand where their long
[03:19:09.760 --> 03:19:12.800]  term strategies are it's important to see where they're going and what they're
[03:19:12.800 --> 03:19:16.000]  doing but if we're going to stop anything if we're going to be anything
[03:19:16.000 --> 03:19:21.040]  other than casual observers we're going to have to get active at the local level
[03:19:21.040 --> 03:19:27.560]  and everything that they do is designed to get you involved in a useless
[03:19:27.560 --> 03:19:31.560]  exercise about the presidential race and if I could tell people anything it
[03:19:31.560 --> 03:19:34.800]  would be yes follow the presidential race understand what these people are
[03:19:34.800 --> 03:19:38.720]  going but understand that's not going to solve your problem that's not going to
[03:19:38.720 --> 03:19:42.880]  stop this bureaucracy the bureaucracy has a life of its own it's going to run
[03:19:42.880 --> 03:19:46.720]  through this unless we put prohibitions at the local level we're going to have
[03:19:46.720 --> 03:19:50.600]  people at the sheriff's level who are going to say to Homeland Security you're
[03:19:50.600 --> 03:19:53.800]  not going to confiscate the guns you're not going to violate people's property
[03:19:53.800 --> 03:19:56.920]  you're not going to surveil people and collect information on them stay with

[03:24:08.320 --> 03:24:11.160]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight your host in this fourth
[03:24:11.160 --> 03:24:15.960]  hour news wrap-up as we were talking to the last caller talking about what is
[03:24:15.960 --> 03:24:20.600]  coming down the pike of course we can look historically at what's been done
[03:24:20.600 --> 03:24:24.840]  with drones and there's been a new leak of documents that's been published by
[03:24:24.840 --> 03:24:29.400]  the intercept that's the Glenn Green Glenn Greenwalls publication they're
[03:24:29.400 --> 03:24:33.040]  the ones who publish the Snowden documents we now have some classified
[03:24:33.040 --> 03:24:37.200]  documents that actually back up what we've heard for quite some time that
[03:24:37.200 --> 03:24:42.360]  most of the people who are being targeted for these assassinations are not
[03:24:42.360 --> 03:24:45.960]  they're they're getting a very small hit rate on people that they would
[03:24:45.960 --> 03:24:48.480]  actually target and of course there's questions about even the people that
[03:24:48.480 --> 03:24:51.880]  they're targeting but 90% of the people that are being killed are what they
[03:24:51.880 --> 03:24:56.200]  used to call collateral damage now they're saying well they're guilty by
[03:24:56.200 --> 03:25:01.120]  association they're not even using the term collateral damage anymore when
[03:25:01.120 --> 03:25:05.040]  Alex Jones interviewed Annie Jacobson about her book the Pentagon's brain I've
[03:25:05.040 --> 03:25:09.240]  been reading that book and what it really tells you is the Pentagon's mind
[03:25:09.240 --> 03:25:14.080]  set now they're talking about the Pentagon's brain trust essentially DARPA
[03:25:14.080 --> 03:25:17.920]  the Defense Department's advanced research project projects the long
[03:25:17.920 --> 03:25:22.920]  history going back to right after World War two when they were created what
[03:25:22.920 --> 03:25:26.040]  they were doing through the Cold War through the Vietnam War as she mentioned
[03:25:26.040 --> 03:25:30.000]  before we had drones since the Vietnam War and of course we know from
[03:25:30.000 --> 03:25:34.680]  declassified documents that they were plotting a 9-11 style attack called
[03:25:34.680 --> 03:25:41.080]  Operation Northwoods they were going to fly civilian airliners remote controlled
[03:25:41.080 --> 03:25:47.200]  remote control folks into buildings and then blame the terror attack on Cuba so
[03:25:47.200 --> 03:25:51.600]  they could invade Cuba so there's nothing fundamentally new about this but
[03:25:51.600 --> 03:25:55.840]  what is going to be new and what is not talked about in these documents because
[03:25:55.840 --> 03:26:00.320]  these documents are historical is what we are on the cusp of and as an
[03:26:00.320 --> 03:26:05.280]  illustration just consider the fact that Tesla cars yesterday if you're an
[03:26:05.280 --> 03:26:09.280]  owner you woke up and your new car had all kinds of capability that was
[03:26:09.280 --> 03:26:14.480]  automatically downloaded to it overnight if you had a Tesla Model S or Model X
[03:26:14.480 --> 03:26:19.800]  electric car your car suddenly had the capability to drive itself for the new
[03:26:19.800 --> 03:26:24.200]  software update when you woke up now why was that what was because they had
[03:26:24.200 --> 03:26:29.360]  already pre-positioned and tested all of the components that they needed that's
[03:26:29.360 --> 03:26:32.520]  what we have to be concerned about with our government with a military
[03:26:32.520 --> 03:26:36.880]  industrial complex that we see they're pre-positioning and pre-testing all of
[03:26:36.880 --> 03:26:42.720]  these components of control population control whether it's psychological mind
[03:26:42.720 --> 03:26:48.040]  control whether it's controlling cars so they can control your movements as they
[03:26:48.040 --> 03:26:52.960]  also spy on your movements and map that into a database so they can then put it
[03:26:52.960 --> 03:26:57.440]  into an automated targeting system to identify you perhaps as a threat
[03:26:57.440 --> 03:27:00.920]  releasing their autonomous killing machines that we know that they're
[03:27:00.920 --> 03:27:06.160]  rapidly entering an arms race on with that this is the danger that we're
[03:27:06.160 --> 03:27:08.920]  looking at now when you look at a car like a Tesla car what have they done
[03:27:08.920 --> 03:27:13.720]  they'd already put in forward-looking radar forward-looking cameras long range
[03:27:13.720 --> 03:27:18.680]  ultra ultrasonic sensors braking and steering controls etc etc so then all
[03:27:18.680 --> 03:27:23.000]  they had to do was to update the software so that it all played together and
[03:27:23.000 --> 03:27:26.760]  of course they say in the long run you're not going to have to keep your
[03:27:26.760 --> 03:27:29.600]  cars on the wheels we've heard this many times there won't be any steering
[03:27:29.600 --> 03:27:35.000]  wheels there won't be any braking pedals they will be in complete control and
[03:27:35.000 --> 03:27:38.240]  the government essentially is going to be in complete control they're going to
[03:27:38.240 --> 03:27:41.840]  share all the information about where you're going what you're doing with the
[03:27:41.840 --> 03:27:45.600]  government so they can can they can tax you they can shut your car down they can
[03:27:45.600 --> 03:27:51.160]  do whatever they wish it is a means of control of transportation control which
[03:27:51.160 --> 03:27:54.920]  is really population control that's why we talk about gun control we say that is
[03:27:54.920 --> 03:27:59.280]  really controlling people and let me give you another example of this we've
[03:27:59.280 --> 03:28:03.800]  talked about this as well many times uber we just had a court case in the
[03:28:03.800 --> 03:28:10.080]  UK where uber won in a court appeal they said that if they'd lost the case the
[03:28:10.080 --> 03:28:13.040]  company would have been forced to change its service to comply with rules
[03:28:13.040 --> 03:28:19.240]  that protect the black cab drivers rules that protect the black cab drivers they
[03:28:19.240 --> 03:28:23.760]  are not being protected by these rules anymore they used to have protection
[03:28:23.760 --> 03:28:27.560]  that's the danger of the government of the protection racket that we call the
[03:28:27.560 --> 03:28:31.640]  government when you go in and you buy protection from the government you're
[03:28:31.640 --> 03:28:35.840]  always subject to losing your position if there's some other crook that comes
[03:28:35.840 --> 03:28:41.880]  in and offers them a better deal and what uber is offering the government they
[03:28:41.880 --> 03:28:47.040]  can't match that with the taxis because uber is offering them control of your
[03:28:47.040 --> 03:28:50.760]  transportation information about everything you do and that is more
[03:28:50.760 --> 03:28:54.880]  valuable to the government than the money that they take from the taxi
[03:28:54.880 --> 03:28:58.440]  drivers you know if you go into New York City the taxi drivers have to pay in
[03:28:58.440 --> 03:29:01.400]  some cases about a half a million dollars for medallion if they want the
[03:29:01.400 --> 03:29:07.280]  full capability to go to airports and that sort of thing they are taxed at a
[03:29:07.280 --> 03:29:11.680]  much higher rate regulated at a much higher rate when I was in Washington we
[03:29:11.680 --> 03:29:16.680]  did that report talking to a taxi driver there how he was getting an immense
[03:29:16.680 --> 03:29:21.120]  double standard there in the city of Washington how they had to go through all
[03:29:21.120 --> 03:29:26.520]  kinds of specialized instructions inspections licensing and they had
[03:29:26.520 --> 03:29:31.600]  their own branch of police that would monitor the taxi drivers there uber got
[03:29:31.600 --> 03:29:34.920]  through without any of that kind of legislation because they are going to
[03:29:34.920 --> 03:29:39.560]  offer control to the government and uber sees himself as the person who is
[03:29:39.560 --> 03:29:43.680]  going to control all cars he says private ownership is going to go away he
[03:29:43.680 --> 03:29:47.600]  will be uber allays stay with us when we come back we're going to talk about
[03:29:47.600 --> 03:29:52.840]  Obama's move to protect Hillary Clinton the empires on the run Alex Jones and
[03:29:52.840 --> 03:29:56.480]  the GCN radio network

[03:30:19.000 --> 03:30:23.720]  increasingly turning to other proposals such as restricting ammunition
[03:30:23.720 --> 03:30:28.680]  magazine rounds and narrowing the ability to wield weapons California
[03:30:28.680 --> 03:30:32.280]  Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom who is running for the Democratic
[03:30:32.280 --> 03:30:37.800]  gubernatorial nomination in 2018 released a statewide ballot campaign
[03:30:37.800 --> 03:30:43.240]  Thursday to require background checks for ammunition purchases why is it that
[03:30:43.240 --> 03:30:47.560]  we have background checks for guns but not background checks for ammunition it
[03:30:47.560 --> 03:30:51.480]  makes no sense mr. Newsom said at his press conference well because it's

[03:32:59.560 --> 03:33:25.160]  we're going to talk about what's going on with those damn emails as Bernie
[03:33:25.160 --> 03:33:28.840]  Sanders said we have an article up on info wars.com mother Ben Guisey victim
[03:33:28.840 --> 03:33:33.520]  says unlike Sanders I am not sick and tired of Hillary's damn emails I say
[03:33:33.520 --> 03:33:37.320]  quote from Bernie Sanders in the debate said I'm tired of hearing about your
[03:33:37.320 --> 03:33:42.520]  emails well you know what Bernie you know that this is not about emails it's
[03:33:42.520 --> 03:33:47.040]  about national security stupid just like they said it's about the economy stupid
[03:33:47.040 --> 03:33:50.600]  when Hill and when Bill Clinton was running it's about national security
[03:33:50.600 --> 03:33:56.600]  stupid that has been the religion with which they have taken every one of our
[03:33:56.600 --> 03:34:01.160]  legal protections all of our rights since 9-11 has been this religion of
[03:34:01.160 --> 03:34:06.920]  national security everyone bow down and worship to the secrecy of the national
[03:34:06.920 --> 03:34:13.000]  security state well here's somebody who openly violates all of the rules and
[03:34:13.000 --> 03:34:18.200]  requirements of this sacred cow when we can't be bothered with that well fine
[03:34:18.200 --> 03:34:22.960]  then why don't you shut down the NSA why don't you shut down Homeland Security
[03:34:22.960 --> 03:34:26.840]  I'll be fine with that let's just let's get Hillary Clinton a pass and we can
[03:34:26.840 --> 03:34:31.360]  shut down this massive surveillance state that you justify in the name of
[03:34:31.360 --> 03:34:36.440]  national security again today we have Huma Abedin testifying before the
[03:34:36.440 --> 03:34:40.600]  Benghazi committee today now that was a mother of the Benghazi victim she says
[03:34:40.600 --> 03:34:44.080]  I'd like to know about this they have the committee there and I have said and
[03:34:44.080 --> 03:34:49.000]  we've had now two congressmen as part of that committee have it have essentially
[03:34:49.000 --> 03:34:54.640]  said indicated that this is about scoring political points I believe
[03:34:54.640 --> 03:34:59.080]  that's true I believe that they don't want to do anything to punish anybody in
[03:34:59.080 --> 03:35:03.160]  the Obama administration no matter how illegal or unconstitutional the actions
[03:35:03.160 --> 03:35:07.720]  they don't want to impeach Obama for violating the Constitution in any number
[03:35:07.720 --> 03:35:11.280]  of ways they don't want to go after Eric Holder or Hillary Clinton they give
[03:35:11.280 --> 03:35:14.600]  them a pass they simply want to score political points I understand that
[03:35:14.600 --> 03:35:18.960]  understand the Democrats are right about that here's another example of that
[03:35:18.960 --> 03:35:24.960]  Obama talks about Clinton's emails this is the New York Times he says I don't
[03:35:24.960 --> 03:35:28.720]  think it posed a national security problem he said that on 60 minutes on
[03:35:28.720 --> 03:35:33.480]  Sunday he said this is not a situation in which America's national security was
[03:35:33.480 --> 03:35:38.080]  endangered essentially giving Clinton a pass on it just like Bernie Sanders the
[03:35:38.080 --> 03:35:42.440]  Democrats are all closing ranks to protect each other politically however
[03:35:42.440 --> 03:35:47.720]  some in the FBI are pushing back on this Ron Husko a former senior FBI
[03:35:47.720 --> 03:35:51.600]  official who retired in 2014 now president of the law enforcement legal
[03:35:51.600 --> 03:35:56.320]  defense fund said it is inappropriate for the president to quote suggest what
[03:35:56.320 --> 03:36:01.000]  side of the investigation he's on while the FBI is still investigating do you
[03:36:01.000 --> 03:36:08.200]  think I mean this administration is so far beyond anything Nixon ever did and
[03:36:08.200 --> 03:36:14.680]  so was the George Bush administration the George W. Bush as well but this is
[03:36:14.680 --> 03:36:18.840]  where we are he says injecting politics into what is supposed to be a fact
[03:36:18.840 --> 03:36:23.560]  finding inquiry leaves a foul taste in the FBI's mouth and makes them fear that
[03:36:23.560 --> 03:36:27.280]  no matter what they find the Justice Department will take the president's
[03:36:27.280 --> 03:36:32.920]  signal and not bring a case do you think do you think I mean they could find her
[03:36:32.920 --> 03:36:37.000]  standing over a dead body with a smoking gun and they wouldn't charge her they
[03:36:37.000 --> 03:36:42.520]  didn't charge the banks you remember Eric Holder's too big to fail again with
[03:36:42.520 --> 03:36:46.360]  Lonnie Brewer pushing that through is that's not in the best interest of the
[03:36:46.360 --> 03:36:52.600]  country to put anybody in these banks in jail or to give them personal fines or
[03:36:52.600 --> 03:36:56.200]  we'll just give a very small fine to the banking institution but we're not
[03:36:56.200 --> 03:37:00.200]  going to pull its charter even though they were caught multiple times laundering
[03:37:00.200 --> 03:37:04.520]  money for terrorist organizations for drug cartels remember all the concern
[03:37:04.520 --> 03:37:10.880]  about El Chapo Sinaloa drug cartel he escaped from prison he had this tunnel
[03:37:10.880 --> 03:37:17.640]  we saw him again they let him go again all of this stuff we had HSBC give him
[03:37:17.640 --> 03:37:23.840]  his own personal checkout window to launder money at their bank the
[03:37:23.840 --> 03:37:28.680]  Sinaloa cartel and we have our government essentially giving them a pass
[03:37:28.680 --> 03:37:32.760]  saying it's not in our best interest to prosecute them so yeah they're not going
[03:37:32.760 --> 03:37:36.160]  to prosecute Hillary Clinton they're going to talk about how these are
[03:37:36.160 --> 03:37:40.680]  simply her personal emails and we don't need to be concerned about it but we
[03:37:40.680 --> 03:37:44.840]  are getting some pushback from some good people in the FBI listen to this
[03:37:44.840 --> 03:37:48.880]  article from the Daily Mail an FBI agent says he could she could be
[03:37:48.880 --> 03:37:53.360]  prosecuted just for failing to tell Obama federal law makes it a crime for
[03:37:53.360 --> 03:37:58.040]  security clearance holders to fail to tell superiors when gross negligence
[03:37:58.040 --> 03:38:03.960]  causes a security breach so unless he was aware that it's a president of what
[03:38:03.960 --> 03:38:07.720]  she was doing when she was doing it it seems there could be a big legal
[03:38:07.720 --> 03:38:12.720]  problem for her well again that would be if we had an honest government if we
[03:38:12.720 --> 03:38:16.800]  had an honest Department of Justice and let me tell you about this double
[03:38:16.800 --> 03:38:20.720]  standard because it was a couple of months ago that I interviewed Thomas
[03:38:20.720 --> 03:38:26.360]  Drake who was one of the four NSA whistleblowers that talked about how the
[03:38:26.360 --> 03:38:30.600]  government was violating the Fourth Amendment by doing dragnet surveillance
[03:38:30.600 --> 03:38:36.320]  on everyone in violation of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act FISA they
[03:38:36.320 --> 03:38:41.360]  were actually using the FISA court as a beard that's the way they pervert the
[03:38:41.360 --> 03:38:45.280]  authority that's the way they pervert the law now Thomas Drake William Benny
[03:38:45.280 --> 03:38:48.640]  that we've talked to as well and others that we've talked to they went through
[03:38:48.640 --> 03:38:53.280]  legal channels within the NSA they weren't listened to so they went to the
[03:38:53.280 --> 03:38:57.360]  Congress the Congress didn't pay any attention either Thomas Drake went to
[03:38:57.360 --> 03:39:01.200]  the press and gave them some information now he was prosecuted as
[03:39:01.200 --> 03:39:05.920]  punishment they said that he had classified and unclassified documents
[03:39:05.920 --> 03:39:09.240]  that were in his possession so they came after him with criminal charges they
[03:39:09.240 --> 03:39:12.960]  dropped all those criminal charges the day the trial was to begin it was
[03:39:12.960 --> 03:39:17.400]  simply a way to punish him and they did punish him they cost him his position
[03:39:17.400 --> 03:39:22.360]  there he was a senior administrator there at the NSA they cost him his job
[03:39:22.360 --> 03:39:27.880]  they cost him his career they cost him his savings so he paid a dear price for
[03:39:27.880 --> 03:39:32.320]  being loyal to the Constitution but he pointed out when he came on and talked
[03:39:32.320 --> 03:39:38.120]  to us and there was a National Press Conference event today where whistle
[03:39:38.120 --> 03:39:42.760]  blowers as well as Jusslyn Radick who has represented many of them they were
[03:39:42.760 --> 03:39:47.560]  talking to the National Press Club and talking to them about what is happening
[03:39:47.560 --> 03:39:51.280]  with Hillary Clinton looking at the double standard that has been applied to
[03:39:51.280 --> 03:39:56.000]  NSA whistleblowers understand that when Obama gives Hillary Clinton a pass on
[03:39:56.000 --> 03:40:01.240]  this he has come after more whistleblowers and journalists using the
[03:40:01.240 --> 03:40:08.360]  1917 espionage act than all the presidents before him since 1917 as a
[03:40:08.360 --> 03:40:13.240]  matter of fact he's done I think it is see the two or three times the number
[03:40:13.240 --> 03:40:18.040]  of all of the previous presidents combined so that's been a favorite tool
[03:40:18.040 --> 03:40:20.840]  of his he loves to come after whistleblowers he loves to come after
[03:40:20.840 --> 03:40:25.920]  journalists but he won't come after a Democrat president candidate that's the
[03:40:25.920 --> 03:40:30.400]  issue here now under the law under section F the information does not have
[03:40:30.400 --> 03:40:35.680]  to be classified to count as a violation and I am reading this from an article
[03:40:35.680 --> 03:40:38.960]  that's put out by Fox News this is Catherine Harage and I find it kind of
[03:40:38.960 --> 03:40:45.080]  ironic that Catherine Harage who has repeatedly used things to scare people
[03:40:45.080 --> 03:40:50.000]  about cyber espionage I remember seeing her on Fox News talking to Greta
[03:40:50.000 --> 03:40:55.640]  Van Susteren about how we needed to have SISPA because of StetsNet because of
[03:40:55.640 --> 03:40:59.800]  the foreign threats like StetsNet everybody has known it's been publicly
[03:40:59.800 --> 03:41:04.600]  made known for years that StetsNet was created by US and Israeli military
[03:41:04.600 --> 03:41:08.040]  intelligence to go after Iran it was never a threat from us and as we know
[03:41:08.040 --> 03:41:11.640]  from Aaron Schwartz and others the United States has been creating and
[03:41:11.640 --> 03:41:15.400]  funding most of these cyber threats but of course they do it to scare us just
[03:41:15.400 --> 03:41:20.120]  like the FBI will in many cases create these threats to tell us that we have
[03:41:20.120 --> 03:41:24.160]  to give up our rights because there's these terrorist groups that they come
[03:41:24.160 --> 03:41:29.480]  in they they create a patsy they they create the plot they arm the plot and
[03:41:29.480 --> 03:41:32.520]  then the last minute they shut it down and say look we caught somebody well
[03:41:32.520 --> 03:41:35.560]  they just created the whole thing themselves nevertheless let's talk
[03:41:35.560 --> 03:41:40.440]  about what is really at stake here the documents do not have to even be
[03:41:40.440 --> 03:41:45.520]  classified to count as a violation that has been Hillary Clinton's excuse all
[03:41:45.520 --> 03:41:49.360]  on that was what Obama was essentially saying he says I don't think they
[03:41:49.360 --> 03:41:53.800]  affected national security they were still classified documents but they
[03:41:53.800 --> 03:41:57.440]  don't even have to be classified documents they say lawful possession of
[03:41:57.440 --> 03:42:01.680]  national defense information by security clearance holder who through gross
[03:42:01.680 --> 03:42:06.240]  negligence such as the use of an unsecure computer network permits the
[03:42:06.240 --> 03:42:11.360]  material to be removed or abstracted from its proper and secure location that's
[03:42:11.360 --> 03:42:15.080]  what we're talking about here and that's of course been her defense that this is
[03:42:15.080 --> 03:42:21.400]  not classified Thomas Drake NSA whistleblower indicted in 2010 under the
[03:42:21.400 --> 03:42:26.640]  espionage act for sharing unclassified material these were a couple of
[03:42:26.640 --> 03:42:31.280]  documents I mean this is the kind of stuff like duck and cover type of
[03:42:31.280 --> 03:42:35.200]  documents it was like training stuff one of them I think was classified they
[03:42:35.200 --> 03:42:38.400]  removed the classification other one was classified afterwards but they had
[03:42:38.400 --> 03:42:43.840]  undocumented unclassified documents that they came after him as well so he
[03:42:43.840 --> 03:42:49.600]  was they came after him for both of these issues and again he says this is
[03:42:49.600 --> 03:42:53.560]  the Secretary of State one of the most targeted individuals by other
[03:42:53.560 --> 03:42:58.080]  intelligence entities and agencies in the world and she is using a private
[03:42:58.080 --> 03:43:02.920]  server to traffic highly sensitive information no doubt including classified
[03:43:02.920 --> 03:43:06.280]  information no doubt including information about sources and methods
[03:43:06.280 --> 03:43:11.200]  said Thomas Drake NSA whistleblower he added whistleblowers treatment shows
[03:43:11.200 --> 03:43:15.000]  that there is one law for the average citizen and apparently a different set
[03:43:15.000 --> 03:43:20.200]  of rules for the rich and powerful she he says but hey I'm Secretary of State he
[03:43:20.200 --> 03:43:25.240]  said in a sarcastic tone even Obama has given her cover and that was on Sunday
[03:43:25.240 --> 03:43:31.240]  as another example former CIA officer Jeffrey Sterling also went to Congress
[03:43:31.240 --> 03:43:35.560]  with his complaints but he was sentenced in May to three and a half years in
[03:43:35.560 --> 03:43:41.160]  prison for violating again the 1917 espionage act he was giving classified
[03:43:41.160 --> 03:43:45.560]  information to a New York Times reporter but he was also convicted of an
[03:43:45.560 --> 03:43:50.040]  obstruction of justice charge because a single email was missing from his
[03:43:50.040 --> 03:43:54.160]  account even though the government could not show that he was responsible for
[03:43:54.160 --> 03:43:58.560]  that so they're investigating him and they say well wait a minute there's an
[03:43:58.560 --> 03:44:02.400]  email that's missing here we think that maybe you might have deleted that email
[03:44:02.400 --> 03:44:08.240]  so they add an obstruction of justice account to this CIA officers they now
[03:44:08.240 --> 03:44:14.800]  understand there are 30,000 emails missing from Clinton okay no obstruction
[03:44:14.800 --> 03:44:19.520]  of justice charge nothing to see move along this is Hillary Clinton we can't
[03:44:19.520 --> 03:44:24.280]  be bothered with that sort of thing and again Jesslyn Radick whistleblower
[03:44:24.280 --> 03:44:28.280]  former ethics advisor to the Department of Justice as a matter of fact she would
[03:44:28.280 --> 03:44:31.360]  they also came after her at one point in time because she was a whistleblower but
[03:44:31.360 --> 03:44:36.160]  she's also defense whistleblower she says powerful and politically connected
[03:44:36.160 --> 03:44:41.920]  individuals accused of the same and much worse conduct receive at most a slap on
[03:44:41.920 --> 03:44:45.880]  the wrist like that general David Petraeus who gave away more secret
[03:44:45.880 --> 03:44:50.120]  information classified at a much higher level to his mistress and received a
[03:44:50.120 --> 03:44:55.120]  sweetheart plea deal for a minor misdemeanor yeah so they have one
[03:44:55.120 --> 03:45:00.520]  standard for a CIA whistleblower one standard for an NSA whistleblower but
[03:45:00.520 --> 03:45:04.560]  a different standard if your general Petraeus or if you're Hillary Clinton
[03:45:04.560 --> 03:45:08.800]  another example of how there are multiple standards again there was this
[03:45:08.800 --> 03:45:12.400]  article that we had an info wars.com yesterday about Ron Paul accusing the
[03:45:12.400 --> 03:45:17.960]  feds of trying to hurt Rand's campaign he testified on the stand and in court
[03:45:17.960 --> 03:45:24.160]  said that he said he went on the court on on the stand and he said that they
[03:45:24.160 --> 03:45:30.880]  released these claims one day one day before the first GOP debate understand
[03:45:30.880 --> 03:45:36.320]  they had this information for four years but they waited until the day before the
[03:45:36.320 --> 03:45:41.960]  debate so they could smear Rand Paul. Ron Paul said I don't consider that to be
[03:45:41.960 --> 03:45:47.920]  a coincidence I consider that to be more than just seeking justice and you
[03:45:47.920 --> 03:45:52.520]  have to understand when you look at the details of this that the US District
[03:45:52.520 --> 03:45:57.840]  Judge has now dismissed all charges against one of the people involved with
[03:45:57.840 --> 03:46:03.960]  the campaign John Tate he was a campaign manager and they released several
[03:46:03.960 --> 03:46:08.160]  they've dismissed the judges dismissed several charges against Jesse Benton
[03:46:08.160 --> 03:46:11.920]  who was a campaign manager one of the charge the only charge that they're
[03:46:11.920 --> 03:46:16.720]  still coming after Jesse Benton for is saying that he lied to the FBI because
[03:46:16.720 --> 03:46:21.560]  he denied knowledge of some emails again we're back at emails hey they're just
[03:46:21.560 --> 03:46:26.040]  emails Bernie would say I don't care about emails well you know the FBI cares
[03:46:26.040 --> 03:46:30.280]  about emails when it's looking at the Ron Paul campaign and they pointed out how
[03:46:30.280 --> 03:46:34.360]  many of you remember what you paid on your taxes last year said his defense
[03:46:34.360 --> 03:46:38.560]  attorney asked the jurors how many of you can remember that email that you got
[03:46:38.560 --> 03:46:43.280]  from your son's teacher two years ago so when the FBI calls me they say well you
[03:46:43.280 --> 03:46:47.200]  remember this email and I don't remember email like that got you you lied to us
[03:46:47.200 --> 03:46:52.520]  and we're gonna send you to jail that's the kind of political persecution that
[03:46:52.520 --> 03:46:56.400]  they're going after so when Hillary Clinton has her own personal server
[03:46:56.400 --> 03:47:00.960]  where she's got confidential statements so that they have been made by foreign
[03:47:00.960 --> 03:47:06.720]  heads of state or other ambassadors on there as well as classified information
[03:47:06.720 --> 03:47:13.320]  when she destroys 30,000 emails not a problem but if you have a single email
[03:47:13.320 --> 03:47:17.280]  that is missing because you're a whistleblower or if you they ask you a question
[03:47:17.280 --> 03:47:21.000]  and you don't remember and you give an incorrect answer then the FBI will come
[03:47:21.000 --> 03:47:26.400]  after you if you're Ron or Rand Paul they will use that to smear you before the
[03:47:26.400 --> 03:47:29.720]  debates that's the double standard that we have just like we're talking about
[03:47:29.720 --> 03:47:34.080]  the double standard with taxi drivers when I when we're looking at that
[03:47:34.080 --> 03:47:38.800]  situation in Washington is a perfect example of the kind of barriers of
[03:47:38.800 --> 03:47:43.480]  competition that they put up to people we shot pictures in Philadelphia of all
[03:47:43.480 --> 03:47:47.360]  the barriers that they put down the center of the street and then cross
[03:47:47.360 --> 03:47:51.560]  barriers concrete barriers that they put so I had metal barriers going down the
[03:47:51.560 --> 03:47:56.120]  lanes multiple rows of barriers so people couldn't move and then barriers to keep
[03:47:56.120 --> 03:48:00.680]  people on the sidewalks and then every block or two they would have massive
[03:48:00.680 --> 03:48:05.440]  concrete barriers to keep cars or vehicles or people from getting into a
[03:48:05.440 --> 03:48:10.600]  street that's for you that's not for the Pope that they were protecting in
[03:48:10.600 --> 03:48:16.280]  Philadelphia and so in the same way as I pointed out in that report Uber and the
[03:48:16.280 --> 03:48:20.760]  government put all kinds of barriers in front of small businesses individuals
[03:48:20.760 --> 03:48:25.960]  like taxi drivers they give them all kinds of rules regulations licensing fees
[03:48:25.960 --> 03:48:29.920]  that are massive that they don't put in the way of those that they want to
[03:48:29.920 --> 03:48:34.920]  protect that they want to enable like the CEO of Uber that's the double
[03:48:34.920 --> 03:48:38.360]  standard that we see going everywhere so if you think this is only affecting the
[03:48:38.360 --> 03:48:42.840]  rich and powerful if you think the politics doesn't affect you understand
[03:48:42.840 --> 03:48:47.000]  that they don't even consider you to be a stakeholder who should know anything
[03:48:47.000 --> 03:48:53.600]  about the massive reorganization of our economy of our government into a global
[03:48:53.600 --> 03:48:56.840]  governance that's what the Senate what Senator Sessions said when he saw the
[03:48:56.840 --> 03:49:03.360]  TPP saw the TTIP he said this is creating global governance he actually took
[03:49:03.360 --> 03:49:08.880]  the time to go in and read it the only one the only senator the only
[03:49:08.880 --> 03:49:12.240]  congressman who actually went in took the time to read this and gave a
[03:49:12.240 --> 03:49:16.680]  detailed report about what he saw the rest of them could care less and we
[03:49:16.680 --> 03:49:20.800]  don't know the precise details even though it's been done for two weeks they
[03:49:20.800 --> 03:49:24.040]  told us we can't tell you any details about this because we're negotiating a
[03:49:24.040 --> 03:49:27.240]  trade agreement we never talk about a trade agreement whilst being negotiated
[03:49:27.240 --> 03:49:31.400]  well now they say they have finished it two weeks ago but we still can't know
[03:49:31.400 --> 03:49:35.560]  because we're not stakeholders the stakeholders know what's in it the
[03:49:35.560 --> 03:49:38.600]  stakeholders have complained about some of the provisions that are in it but
[03:49:38.600 --> 03:49:43.040]  we the people don't know because there's a different standard for us than
[03:49:43.040 --> 03:49:47.360]  there is for everybody else now there's also another very troubling article they
[03:49:47.360 --> 03:49:51.000]  came up today and Joe Biggs has been talking about this and the the news
[03:49:51.000 --> 03:49:55.080]  update that we run at the breaks talking about the move towards ammunition
[03:49:55.080 --> 03:49:58.640]  control this has been something that the Obama administration has been very
[03:49:58.640 --> 03:50:02.560]  cleverly doing from the very beginning of their administration now they're
[03:50:02.560 --> 03:50:06.560]  talking about doing this in New York we've had I'm sorry and in California
[03:50:06.560 --> 03:50:11.360]  New York already passed a law to do this they found that they didn't really
[03:50:11.360 --> 03:50:17.240]  have the capability to execute it this was done as part of the 2013 safe act
[03:50:17.240 --> 03:50:21.480]  in New York required instant ammunition background checks but the governor
[03:50:21.480 --> 03:50:27.480]  there Andrew Cuomo who was certainly is no fan of the Second Amendment he says
[03:50:27.480 --> 03:50:31.720]  we need to shut the government down until we shut down people's gun rights he
[03:50:31.720 --> 03:50:35.800]  suspended that provision in July said that they didn't have the capability to
[03:50:35.800 --> 03:50:39.520]  actually do it so now we've got someone who's lieutenant governor in
[03:50:39.520 --> 03:50:44.240]  California saying New York tried it but California is gonna do it said Mr.
[03:50:44.240 --> 03:50:48.160]  Newsom and we're gonna talk about how they're going to do it what that means
[03:50:48.160 --> 03:50:58.160]  to you when we come back stay with us to be right back

[03:53:58.160 --> 03:54:14.080]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight and joining me in this
[03:54:14.080 --> 03:54:16.840]  segment is Leanne McAdoo we're going to talk about what's coming up on the
[03:54:16.840 --> 03:54:20.520]  nightly news tonight as we went to break we were talking about the article on
[03:54:20.520 --> 03:54:25.440]  info wars.com ammo control picks up steam among Democrats aiming to limit gun
[03:54:25.440 --> 03:54:29.640]  access and this is California Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom who is
[03:54:29.640 --> 03:54:34.520]  going to run for governor of California in 2018 he says why is it that we have
[03:54:34.520 --> 03:54:37.480]  background checks for guns but not background checks for ammunition it
[03:54:37.480 --> 03:54:42.720]  makes no sense he says well they tried it and we're not able to actually execute
[03:54:42.720 --> 03:54:47.080]  it in New York but this is something that the Liberals have been doing since
[03:54:47.080 --> 03:54:49.880]  the beginning of the Obama administration right after Obama took
[03:54:49.880 --> 03:54:56.000]  office they suspended the brass recycling program for the military and if
[03:54:56.000 --> 03:54:58.640]  you don't know what that is the military makes its own ammunition and of course
[03:54:58.640 --> 03:55:03.040]  they expend quite a bit of it as they train the empty shells they would
[03:55:03.040 --> 03:55:08.720]  recycle and sell back into the domestic civilian market and Obama stopped that
[03:55:08.720 --> 03:55:13.160]  practice it was restarted by the senators and protests and yet we still
[03:55:13.160 --> 03:55:18.240]  heard several years later in 2012 that some locations like Fort Drum in New
[03:55:18.240 --> 03:55:23.320]  York were crushing the brass and selling it at a much cheaper rate it's not a
[03:55:23.320 --> 03:55:27.720]  good deal for the government and it is violating the law as well but doing it
[03:55:27.720 --> 03:55:32.800]  nevertheless to keep that off of the marketplace then we found that there were
[03:55:32.800 --> 03:55:36.920]  billions of rounds of ammunition being purchased by Homeland Security out of
[03:55:36.920 --> 03:55:40.880]  the civilian market which created all kinds of ammunition shortages now they
[03:55:40.880 --> 03:55:43.960]  want to put background checks in here because they understand that if you
[03:55:43.960 --> 03:55:49.840]  don't have ammunition your gun is nothing but a club that is the essential
[03:55:49.840 --> 03:55:55.320]  way of doing gun confiscation to take away your ammunition now as we look at
[03:55:55.320 --> 03:55:59.200]  that again remember that Obama who was grandstanding about this shooting in
[03:55:59.200 --> 03:56:04.600]  Oregon remember that two days later they shot up a hospital run by doctors
[03:56:04.600 --> 03:56:07.880]  without borders for over a half hour they knew about this hospital they
[03:56:07.880 --> 03:56:11.680]  changed their story four different stories and four different four days in
[03:56:11.680 --> 03:56:15.120]  a row just like Benghazi constantly changing the story but of course we
[03:56:15.120 --> 03:56:19.240]  can't be bothered in the American press to be worried about that because no
[03:56:19.240 --> 03:56:22.280]  Americans died I guess it doesn't really matter when you're burning patients to
[03:56:22.280 --> 03:56:27.280]  death in their beds if they're not American patients but now we have a new
[03:56:27.280 --> 03:56:31.840]  update from AP today saying that special operations analysts had assembled a
[03:56:31.840 --> 03:56:36.320]  dossier that included maps with the hospital circled that would verify what
[03:56:36.320 --> 03:56:39.880]  doctors without borders had been saying that this is well known they had
[03:56:39.880 --> 03:56:46.120]  identified the place multiple times given the exact GPS coordinates to the to
[03:56:46.120 --> 03:56:50.240]  the governments and yet it was deliberately targeted because they
[03:56:50.240 --> 03:56:55.880]  were looking to track a Pakistani operative that is a violation of Geneva
[03:56:55.880 --> 03:56:59.840]  Convention that is a violation of international law if you bomb a hospital
[03:56:59.840 --> 03:57:04.600]  because there's some people in there that you want to get so Leigh Ann tell
[03:57:04.600 --> 03:57:09.000]  us what's coming up tonight on the nightly news well we're gonna look we're
[03:57:09.000 --> 03:57:12.240]  gonna wrap up our interview with Brandy Vaughan looking into what's really
[03:57:12.240 --> 03:57:16.920]  behind this push for mandatory vaccinations key information there
[03:57:16.920 --> 03:57:20.680]  mcChile Thalen just came out with an article middle school assignment would
[03:57:20.680 --> 03:57:25.240]  you save whites or blacks from a sinking ship so obviously that has nothing to do
[03:57:25.240 --> 03:57:28.680]  with any history that anyone would need to know talk about how I'm just a
[03:57:28.680 --> 03:57:33.560]  blatant pushing of racism right not treating people let's not consider
[03:57:33.560 --> 03:57:38.320]  anybody to be human beings right let's focus on them being white or black
[03:57:38.320 --> 03:57:41.800]  whether or not you're gonna save them and there's no differentiation is what
[03:57:41.800 --> 03:57:45.160]  about what it what if it was a black conservative you know so they don't say
[03:57:45.160 --> 03:57:47.960]  anything like that there's also an article up on info wars teacher tells
[03:57:47.960 --> 03:57:52.200]  13-year-old black conservative he's not worth saving in a fire so I guess it
[03:57:52.200 --> 03:57:55.840]  just sort of depends on what your politics there if your ideology isn't
[03:57:55.840 --> 03:58:00.680]  aligned with the establishment you're fine you can we'll save you but the rest
[03:58:00.680 --> 03:58:05.040]  of the people are gonna be rounded up you know a domestic extremists wow wow
[03:58:05.040 --> 03:58:09.560]  absolutely insane but that's that's coming up tonight 7 central 8 p.m.
[03:58:09.560 --> 03:58:39.080]  eastern leon macadoo is going to be hosting the nightly news join us then
